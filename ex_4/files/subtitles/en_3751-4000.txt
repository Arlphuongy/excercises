Ryo.
Ryo.
Ryo!
Ryo!
Ryo!
Somebody!
Anyone here?!
Is anyone here?!
-All right, listen up. -Yes, sir.
There might be more people under the rubble. We should…
Excuse me! I can't find my son!
Where are the rescued…
Ryo.
Mr. Kanda. You're okay.
Yuko, are you all right?
I'll get some blankets.
Have you seen my son?
Mr. Kanda.
What's going on?
Hello?
Somebody…
It's not safe in there!
Wait.
Wait.
Hey!
Are you okay?
Thank goodness.
I woke up washed up on the beach.
No one is responding to me and I can't feel any physical touch.
I didn't know what was going on and then you called out--
I understand.
First…
Let's try to calm down first.
Take a deep breath.
It was a pretty big one.
For now, come to our place.
Oh, can you walk?
Like I said,
Like I said, I came up with the idea for this star sand.
Okay?
You've seen these in souvenir shops, right?
I used to buy them for my family on work trips.
Right?
That's all me.
There he goes again.
It's the truth, okay? You see, I participated in a student protest, right?
You see, I participated in a student protest, right?
I went completely broke back then, so I ran away to Iriomote Island.
And you stuffed the sand in bottles and sold them, right? We heard.
Oh, do we have a new guest?
Oh…
From that earthquake?
Probably.
Well, hi there.
You must've been through a lot.
That…
It was huge.
Michael.
Um, what's this place?
Well…
It's hard to explain, but…
It's all right.
Don't worry.
We've got plenty of time, okay?
Kaori, give her a tour.
Sure. I'm Kaori.
This way.
I'm sorry.
What is all this?
I-I don't want to explain.
Well…
People who have regrets in the living world are gathered here.
Well, it's not just here.
There are places like this all over the country.
Regrets?
What do you mean?
Hey, Akira.
Don't beat around the bush.
Then you tell her, Shori.
So basically, you died.
But you can't go over to the other side because you have some unfinished business.
Died?
I died…
Now, now. Come on. Get some rest for today.
We have alcohol too.
I don't want any.
Come with me, okay?
You'll be fine.
There's probably a guy.
Probably.
Really? At her age?
Hang on.
This way.
The last occupant left.
So feel free to stay here.
I know it's a lot to handle all at once.
So get a good night's rest.
Are you all the same as me?
That's right.
We're your seniors.
We're quite the experts.
Goodnight.
Here's your baby. Congratulations.
Why won't you understand?!
I'm--
That's what you want!
Mind your own business!
There, there.
Ryo, come here.
Scary!
Happy birthday to…
Congratulations!
-Look. -Move.
What are you doing?!
Mommy, look.
Stop!
Hurry up and go.
-I don't want to go! -Why? I have to go to work!
I don't want to go to school!
Mommy.
Wake up.
-Mommy! -Ryo!
-Hey. -Morning.
Good morning.
Hey.
Hi there.
Good morning.
Good morning. Kaori, I'd like some coffee too.
Sure thing.
Here.
What's that?
It's yoga.
A dead person doing yoga and trying to stay healthy?
Shut it.
Yoga.
I'm the one who brought yoga to Japan.
Enough already.
It's the truth.
That's how I hurt my back. Right here.
Good morning.
Hey, miss. Good morning.
You look cute in daylight.
What's your name?
Minako Kawakami.
Minako.
Man, really. You're pretty.
Michael.
You can't say things like that in this day and age.
What? Really? Why?
This old man here is Michael.
And the guy who brought you here is Akira.
That young man is Shori.
He used to be a yakuza.
That's Mr. Tanaka, a former banker
and I'm Kaori, a former hostess of a bar.
J-Join us.
Hey!
STOCK MARKET CRASH
1990 OCTOBER 2
This…
Well, it's an old habit of mine.
Can I borrow your car key?
Huh?
Oh, sure.
She's got a bad attitude.
PLEASE CONTACT US IF YOU HAVE INFORMATION ON MISSING CHILDREN LISTED BELOW
Chinatsu!
Aiko!
Kazuki!
You too?
I got separated from my family.
I thought I might find them if I shout their names out every day.
But…
if they can hear me, it means they're dead.
I hope…
you find your family too.
The highway acted as a breakwater, so urban areas were less affected.
We haven't found Kawakami yet.
Let's hope she's safe.
The rescue teams are doing their best to find the missing people.
What we can do right now is to work with the police
What we can do right now is to work with the police and report accurate news promptly.
Get to work.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Kanda, I'm right here.
-Oh, welcome back. -Hi.
Uh, yeah.
Oh, thank you.
Great timing. We're having hot pot tonight.
You wanna join us?
Sorry, I'm not in the mood for it.
That's exactly why you should come.
Okay?
Oh…
It is now autumn
At this empty beach
Even if
Even if A single dream breaks
A single dream breaks
His one-thousandth time.
I won't forget you
Because I promised the sand
No matter how sad I am
I will not die
"Empty Beach."
I-It's such a good song. Right, Shori?
Sure, sure.
Minako, do you want to sing something?
No thanks.
Yeah? That's a shame.
Okay, here it is. The hot pot's ready!
Come on.
-Done. -Come here.
Thank you.
So heavy!
Kaori's special hot pot!
Looks good!
-Have some meat. -Come on. Let's eat.
Meat gives you energy.
-Let's dig in. -Let's eat.
Yum!
Um…
Do you all have regrets in the living world?
Well, yeah.
R-Regret is all we have.
Is that why you're all lazing around?
I wouldn't say we're lazing around.
Huh?
Well, I guess it does look like we're just fooling around.
I don't mean to be rude,
but I can't waste my time like this.
Minako.
Could you stick around for just today?
Why?
Because
we might be able to help you.
Y-Yeah. That's what I was going to say.
Yeah, right.
It's time. Hurry up and eat!
Hurry.
Hi there.
We can't start without doing this, right?
Start what?
We always do this as a purification ritual before making films.
He's a self-proclaimed film producer.
Come see when you have time. They're all masterpieces.
Y-You can watch them all in the cinema over there.
All right. Let's get going.
Okay, then. Let's go.
What's everyone doing?
Once a month,
on the night of a new moon, we all get together and search.
What?
We search for the ones we're looking for.
This is so strange.
I didn't think I'd be with people when I died.
Shori.
Trying to make sense of a contradiction is a contradiction in itself.
That's true.
Oh, hey. Hey!
I found them.
Chinatsu.
Dear…
Aiko.
-Dad. -Dad…
Kazuki.
I'm sorry.
Strange, isn't it?
We're dead, but we're here.
We definitely exist in this world.
We exist.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't protect you.
My back hurts.
Kaori, beer please.
Okay.
Here.
-Thank you. -Does Minako want any?
I'll give it to her.
Thanks.
Here.
What did you think?
What?
Uh…
I was surprised…
and confused.
Who wouldn't be?
Minako, I hope you find your boyfriend soon too.
Hey! That's enough.
Why?
It's my son.
I…
I have a son I raised alone named Ryo. He's seven.
My only concern is whether he's alive or not.
Will you let me stay here a little longer?
Thumbs up to that.
O-Of course you can.
We'll find him.
Thumbs up?
Thumbs up then.
Thumbs up.
Right, come here. Let's have a toast.
We understand.
Kaori.
-All right. Cheers. -Cheers.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
It's open.
Oh, come in.
W-What are these?
These are the notes I've been taking.
But you know,
I'll summarize them into one story. I am an author.
Right.
Something wrong?
Um, thank you for asking me to stick around the other day.
I feel a little better.
No worries. I know what you're going through.
Are you looking for someone too?
Oh, no. I'm not.
I just want to take note of all this.
I want to keep a record that there's a world like this after we die.
Is that your unfinished business?
I'm not sure.
Oh. You want the car, right?
You can use it whenever you want.
Thank you.
We'll definitely find him.
Don't worry.
You can rely on us more.
Minako.
Please let me interview you sometime.
Tell me about your life.
If you'd like.
Hi there.
Hey.
Nice.
Looking good.
Shut up.
I made a yakuza film a long time ago.
One of those half-assed films, right?
No, it's a very good one. I'll show it to you sometime.
Sure, sure.
Okay, I'm off.

MISSING FROM HOSHISUNA, MINAKO KAWAKAMI (35)
Boss, happy birthday.
Congratulations.
I appreciate it.
Drink up.
Thank you.
Dad, happy birthday.
Eat.
Thank you.
WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE?
I'm back.
Hi.
Kaori, b-beer please.
Sure thing.
-I'll leave it here. -Yeah.
What's wrong, Shori?
You look glum.
Huh? Do I?
Today was your dad's birthday, right?
How was he?
Well, he's gotten pretty old.
Well, yeah.
It's already been seven years since you came here.
I wonder sometimes.
That it wouldn't have been this way if I stayed by his side.
I made a yakuza film before.
But the yakuza t-today have it rough.
They're a symbol of society.
B-But they were separated from society and they're not even given human rights.
I'll show it to you when you come to the cinema next time.
Yeah, okay. I got it.
What's your unfinished business, Shori?
What's with the sudden interest?
I told my story to everyone.
I ended up here because I was killed in a yakuza conflict seven years ago.
I left my wife behind.
Huh? You were married?
Well, not exactly a wife.
It wasn't official.
He's actually quite a softie.
What? Keep your mouth shut.
You've been looking for her for seven years?
Well, I'm not really sure.
Maybe I don't want to see her.
It's not like I can hold her anymore.
WHAT HAPPENS IF UNFINISHED BUSINESS IS LEFT UNRESOLVED?
Hello?
Is everyone else safe?
I see. Let's do our best.
Yeah.
Bye.
1970, OKINAWA
It is now autumn
At this empty…
Sasaki, Tamashiro was arrested.
I see.
Authorities are coming with an iron fist.
They're coming for you next.
Keep a low profile.
I know.
Tamashiro's arrest will be the headline for tomorrow's flyer.
Yeah. I'll get it done by the end of the day.
So, Maiko.
See you tomorrow.
Koga.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Don't worry.
The other day our comrade, Tamashiro, was unlawfully arrested on the street.
We will never give in to such oppression from the authorities!
That's right!
Now is the time for students--
We cannot let you occupy the university any longer.
Remove the barricade and come out immediately.
Sprechchor!
Sprechchor!
Give Okinawa back to us!
Give Okinawa back to us!
We're against the Vietnam War!
We're against the Vietnam War!
Remove the U.S. military base!
Remove the U.S. military base!
Charge!
Unite!
Unite!
Unite!
Unite!
Koga!
What time is it?
It's still midnight. You should lie down.
Does it hurt?
You scared me!
Sorry. I kind of just walked in.
M-M-Minako.
W-What a surprise.
What was that film called?
Oh. In Search for Lost Time.
It's great, right?
Yeah. It ended halfway though.
Yeah, I know. It's not complete because I died.
Really?
This film will leave a very huge impact on young people today.
It's incredible.
The poster was going to be Maiko, the heroine, standing alone on the beach.
And bam! The title right on top.
It was going to be a huge hit.
The poster was decided already?
O-O-Of course it was.
I was the decision-maker for everything.
The theme, story, and all of it.
But why did you want to shoot a film about a student protest?
Oh, this.
This is a true story about me.
It's an autobiography?
Not exactly…
You see, I was participating in a student protest.
Regardless of whether it was right or w-wrong,
there was unity.
Films are the same.
A bunch of grown-ups working passionately towards the same goal. It's amazing.
You really loved films, huh?
Yeah.
If it's an autobiography, was Maiko your girlfriend?
Yeah, well. I-I guess s-she was.
What happened to you two?
Well, you know. A-A lot happened.
But I wish she could've seen the completed film.
I think she might still be waiting.
Nah.
I wonder.
I'm home.
Welcome back.
Hey, dinner's ready.
Come on, Kenta.
She said dinner's ready.
Hey, Kenta. Stop playing your game.
-Riko, this is for Mom. -Okay.
Kenta! I said dinner.
Here.
You?
The usual amount.
-Kenta? -I want a lot.
A lot… This good?
Yeah, thanks.
Kenta, you're gobbling up the food.
So? How are your club activities going?
Seconds.
-You have a match next week? -Yeah.
Think you can win?
Piece of cake.
-They were mercy-ruled last time. -Don't say that!
W-Why'd you…
I saw that game too.
Don't bring it up.
The baby kicked.
Really?
Wait, hold on…
Do it again.
-The baby kicked! -Yeah.
-Kenta. -I'm good.
Come.
It's vintage, but it's still usable.
Look, it's so shiny.
Hey, Minako.
Good morning.
What are you doing?
I was deeply moved by your words yesterday!
What? Which words?
Why did you get him worked up? I've got plans today.
Seriously, I'm not following.
Minako, you worked in TV, right?
More like a journalist.
Okay, then. Take this.
Listen,
I decided to complete that film.
Come again?
All right. Everyone listen.
TV shows come and go, but films are unforgettable.
I can't have you doing this halfheartedly.
So what are we supposed to--
Right. Akira, you look slow. So you can hold this.
What? This?
Kaori, you do the recording.
Wow, that's an important job.
-Tanaka, you're the assistant director. -Yes.
Yes.
And Shori.
Y-You're good looking, s-so you can play my son.
Here's the script.
What?
IN SEARCH FOR LOST TIME
Michael, you're the director?
I'm the lead and the director. It's Yang Ik-june style.
What? What style?
-Huh? -Okay, then.
Let's begin.
Take one.
Ready.
Start.
It's been…
50 years since then.
What's next?
-"I want to see her again." -Huh? What?
What?
"I want to see her again."
Cut!
Ready, roll!
What was it?
Um…
Oh, your board is in the shot.
"I want to see her again."
It's not about the lines.
It's the emotion.
Okay. Once more.
I'm into it already.
It doesn't open smoothly.
"I want to see her again."
I know that.
Too bright!
How long do I have to wait?
Just get into…
Watch me and prepare for your role.
-Let's do this in one take. -Yeah.
Oh…
-It's been 50 years since then. -I know that.
W-W-What? W-Why are you turning it?
It's nothing.
We can start with "It's been…"
O-Oh, well. It's still the first day.
The team is not one yet.
Is that how it is?
Yes, it is.
Filmmaking is all about teamwork. Right?
Why are you asking me?
Anyway, I think we all need to hold a review meeting.
Minako, I'll teach you about the camera.
I'm good.
-Why? Come on. -Huh?
Is that a guest?
I'll go.
At such a young age…
Hello.
You can see me?
What's going on?
I'm new here too.
Let's go over there for now.
Your name?
Nana.
Hi there.
You like films?
What?
Nice to meet you.
I know. It's shocking, right?
I'm sorry, but--
I'm not sorry.
I'm so glad my shitty life ended.
We've got one very jaded kid in the house.
Huh? Who the hell are you?
Okay.
Young lady, there's a place you can rest. Let's go.
That girl is you-know-what, right, Tanaka?
Probably.
Okay, I'm off.
Shori.
Huh?
Congratulations starting your seventh year.
Shut up.
I'm sorry, Shori.
I've decided to dissolve the group.
KATO FAMILY
THANKS FOR LETTING ME RIDE ON YOUR PRECIOUS MOTORBIKE!
I'm home.
Hi.
You're home early.
Yeah. I sent you a text.
I didn't realize. Sorry.
Curry for dinner?
Yeah, thanks.
Mizuki.
I got a day off next week.
Do you want to visit my parents?
I haven't had the chance to introduce you.
Yeah. Sounds good.
I think we should talk about our future too.
You're right.
It's been a while.
You haven't changed at all.
He seems like a good guy.
Well, I'm better looking than him though.
I'm sorry.
Have a good life.
…memories of you
Even if you do not return
I won't…
-You're back late. -Hey.
Kaori, I'll have a hard one.
Sure thing.
Because I promised the sky
No matter how lonely I am
I will not die
No matter how lonely I am…
Shori, did something happen?
…I will not die
I saw her.
What?
Seems like she's already over me.
She looked well.
I think she's getting married.
That's a relief, huh?
Yeah.
And you know what?
Her new man is such a great guy.
The complete opposite of me.
I'm so glad.
She'll be okay now.
I'm sure.
Hey, Shori!
Y-You haven't seen my film yet.
You're right.
I'll watch it.
Your boring yakuza film.
Yeah, t-that's what I'm talking about.
Then, let's go. Let's go now.
-Akira, get the car. -Let's go.
Let's go!
-You're gonna be moved. -Are you sure?
Hey, kid.
Make sure to live your life.
What?
You have anywhere to go?
You wanna join us?
Boss, what are you--
Oh, come on.
Doesn't hurt to have a bigger family.
What's your name?
Masashi…
Yamada.
So? It's good, right?
It's all right.
Come over once things are settled.
Let's go.
Shall we go?
Yeah.
I'm the one who made yoga popular.
Not again.
It was 30 years ago. I was in advertising, right?
There was a fitness boom back then--
Shori's gone so there's no one here to stop him.
-I was the one-- -Nana, good morning.
Morning.
Where's that yakuza guy?
He went to the other side.
Y-You're not making sense.
Do you have regrets or unfinished business from when you were alive?
What?
I think that's the reason you're here.
You're freaking me out. Is this some kind of cult?
A cult? How rude.
Oh, hey. Do you want to shoot a film with us?
-Minako, shall we go? -Ew.
Sure.
Nana, take a seat.
DECEASED
Every day, I'm scared to look through this.
I wonder what'll happen to me if I find Ryo's name here.
Yeah.
So you want to know about my life?
Yes.
I want to know more about you before you move on to the other side.
Um…
I'm Minako Kawakami. 35 years old.
I was a journalist here, for Hokuto TV, and a single mother to a seven-year-old.
Your husband?
We split up soon after Ryo was born.
I wanted to work but he didn't want me to.
Since then, it's just been Ryo and me.
What was this world like for you?
You mean the living world?
Yes.
I don't know.
I was so frantic with work and parenting.
Looking back, I don't know why I was trying so hard.
If you could go back, what would you like to do?
I want to…
go on a trip with Ryo.
Because I've never been able to take him on one.
And…
I want to apologize to him.
There are lots of unknown facts in the world we can't see,
such as atoms, electrons and elementary particles.
For example, what we're experiencing is three dimensional.
Four dimensional, if we add time.
Lisa Randall, a scientist…
It's gonna go viral.
This is genius.
Are you gonna post it?
-So true. -Hey…
Yasuko.
Don't slit your wrist like Nana, okay? It's so annoying.
Everything okay there?
-Yup. -Sorry.
So let's review the word "dimension."
It is defined as an indicator for measurement of space.
Okay. What is one dimension? It is a line.
Here's dessert.
Hey.
Oh, Nana.
I get that I died, but…
Can I kill a person?
There's someone I wanna kill.
Hey, Nana.
Don't say things like that.
We can't harm people in the living world from this world.
How stupid.
I mean, you're all dead.
Hey.
It has no taste at all.
How long do I have to stay in this hell?!
Nana.
Why don't you come with us?
I want to show you something.
What?
Trust me and just tag along.
All right, then. Let's go!
Huh?
What's this?
Everyone who died and left behind those who are important to them.
We all search together…
for the ones we are looking for.
The ones we're looking for…
I don't know what your regret is,
but we can help if you want.
Hey, over here!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
-Isn't this good? -I got a message!
I…
There's someone I want to apologize to.
This is your baby's face. There's the eyes and nose.
Here's the mouth.
I didn't want to die until my daughter gave birth.
So, I fought my destiny and here I am.
This world is pretty lenient, isn't it?
I think so too.
I was able to be with them for a long time.
I have no more regrets.
Watching my kids all this time made me realize…
that they're very strong.
Maybe they would've been fine without me from the start.
I think that sometimes.
That's not true.
DAY 32, NOTHING ON SHELTER'S NOTICEBOARD HOKUTO TV, NO PROGRESS
Oh my, Michael.
Hey, why are you sleeping here?
Let's go to your room, okay? Mr. Tanaka, give me a hand.
Okay.
Wake up.
Michael, you ready?
One, two, lift.
Okay, let's walk.
He's so drunk.
Is it going well?
Yes. I enjoy writing.
I can't see the end though.
It's your turn, Akira.
Tell me.
What? No. I have nothing interesting to tell.
You always dodge the question when it's about you.
Do I?
I want to know what your life was like.
Minako,
I'm sensing the spirit of a journalist.
You're right.
But…
I guess I don't mind telling you.
The reason why
I can't go to the other side.
Is this your…
Yes.
My dad looks stubborn, right?
I've always been sickly so for me,
his existence was the scariest thing in the world.
Your lunch stinks.
What? She's picking them up.
What's she going to do with that?
Is she gonna eat that?
That's disgusting.
What a freak.
She got something on me. Ew.
-You okay? -So gross.
Nana.
Y-Yasuko.
Yasuko, I'm sorry!
Nana…
Why…
Nana…
Nana, why…
Yasuko, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, Yasuko.
I'm so sorry.
Why… Nana.
Nana.
I practically lived in my bed.
I was a ranch owner's son, but I wasn't capable of physical labor.
I always thought
my dad didn't accept me as a member of the family.
When they told me my remaining days,
I thought, "Why me?"
I took it out on my family so many times.
I've hurt them a lot.
I think…
this is the reason why I can't move on.
My dad, who's never even read a book,
has been writing a novel for many years now.
A story about me.
If I were alive,
maybe he wouldn't be writing a novel.
Or maybe he would've anyway. I'll never know.
But it made me happy.
It felt like I finally got to know my dad.
AKIRA CHEERED ON THE NEWBORN CALF…
Though…
I only wish I had known while I was alive.
Nana.
Your room's a mess.
My bad.
What are you writing?
I'm keeping a record of everything that's happened since I got here.
BEFORE GOING TO "THE OTHER SIDE" (WORKING TITLE) CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Something wrong?
You know,
I apologized.
But…
nothing changed.
Why?
I'm sure that one day,
your voice will be heard.
Don't worry.
That's not an answer.
You can borrow that.
-Goodnight. -Goodnight.
Minako!
Minako!
Minako, he's alive!
Y-Y-Your son! He's alive!
He's alive.
HOSHISUNA HOME FOR CHILDREN
We'll wait out here.
Ryo has a fever again.
It's already been a week. Let's take him to see a doctor again tomorrow.
Okay.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Ryo, we'll go to the doctor tomorrow, okay?
I want to see my mommy.
I know.
I'm sure we'll find your mom.
Ryo.
I'm sorry I left you all on your own.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Are you there?
Yes.
I'm right here.
I wanted to apologize to you.
I went to pick you up from your school,
but I was washed away by the tsunami.
I'm sorry.
Mommy, we're going home together, right?
I wish I could.
Do I have to live here forever?
I'm so sorry.
I'll watch over you so that you won't be alone, okay?
Okay.
Mommy.
Tell me a story until I fall asleep.
Sure.
Which story?
Something fun you did recently.
In the world I'm in right now,
everyone helps to find each other's loved ones.
Like a parade.
That sounds amazing.
They helped me find you too.
I see.
Then, it's your turn to help everyone.
Yeah.
You're right.
Hey, Mr. Tanaka.
Yes?
I have one unfinished business.
Will you help me out?
If it's within my power.
Akira.
Don't give me that "I'm so heartbroken" look.
What are you talking about?
I'm not.
Yeah, but Minako was a fox.
If I was younger, I would've--
Ew.
What?
What do you mean "Ew"?
Ew.
Minako.
I'm back.
Come here.
You want coffee?
Thanks, Kaori.
Michael.
I haven't thanked you properly.
Thank you.
Stop it. You're making me blush.
Your film.
Let's complete it.
Huh?
I'll stay until we do.
You want her to see it, right?
Come on, stop it! You're gonna make me cry.
All right. I-I'll do it. Yeah.
This film is going to be great.
You too, Nana.
What? No way.
Nana, this is mandatory.
No way.
-Tanaka. -Yes.
Get the camera.
As you wish!
All right.
Let's do this.
-It's rolling. -Okay.
Take one.
Ready, start!
It's been 50 years.
This film is almost complete.
The protagonist, Koga,
believed in the revolution and devoted himself to the student protest.
But in fear of getting caught,
he decides to go back to Tokyo on the day of the protest…
without his girlfriend.
He ran away.
The pathetic fool.
Koga, wait!
I'm sorry.
There's no way I can start a revolution.
You don't have to.
Just stay with me.
We'll meet again. I promise.
And so, Koga quit the student protest
and ran away to Tokyo.
I know these will sell.
Maiko married Sasaki.
And Koga buried himself in work.
They both lived their lives with a lid on the past they had shared.
50 years had passed.
Koga returned to the city of Okinawa again.
Memories of that day come back to his mind like it was yesterday.
M-M-Maiko…
He's really into it.
Are you Mitsuru Koga?
And by a strange coincidence…
Koga has an encounter with Maiko's grandchild.
Huh? Me?
You know my grandma, right?
Huh?
Are you Maiko's…
Please come see her.
Grandma's been longing to see you.
Cut.
What are you, a prodigy?
You're incredible!
It's a thumbs up!
Wonderful!
Nana!
Stop it!
Please come see her.
-Michael, don't! -He's mocking me.
I see.
You went on before me.
Koga!
Goodbye!
Koga,
live your life to the fullest.
Koga!
Maiko.
Maiko!
Maiko!
Koga!
Maiko!
Maiko!
Michael.
-No. Wait, Michael. -Michael!
Michael!
What's wrong?
Maiko!
Michael!
Michael!
Maiko!
Let's show it on the big screen.
Yes, let's.
What's wrong?
A-About that…
I want to give this film to someone.
But I feel really embarrassed doing stuff like that.
Could you all go and do it for me?
What? Do it yourself.
I know, but…
Michael.
Let's go together.
I'll come with you.
T-This is kinda nice. This whole camaraderie thing.
Okay.
I'll go.
For real? There's so many people.
Yeah. It's crazy.
Hey, you guys.
There's something I want to show you.
Come with me.
This way.
Look at this!
See this?
Is this you, Michael?
-You're a major producer. -Don't flatter me.
You weren't lying.
Of course I wasn't.
I thought you were.
Yeah, we all did.
See.
Oh, wow.
"FILM SHOULD BE FREEDOM"
This is nerve-wracking.
I-I'm really bad at stuff like this.
You're gonna be fine. We'll wait for you out here.
I changed my mind.
We came all the way out here.
But--
Koga. Is that you?
S-Sasaki?
What is it? After all this time.
I-I want to apologize to Maiko.
Please let me see her.
Come in.
Sasaki, when did you die?
Two years ago. Cancer.
I see.
What's that?
Oh, this.
It's my new film.
I-It's about me, M-Maiko, and you.
Films even after you died?
You film freak.
That's right.
This is the only thing I can do.
This way.
Maiko, you haven't changed at all.
She's always been rooting for you.
But she chose you.
You know…
I still think about the time we spent back then.
We couldn't start a revolution.
But…
We were united. That, I know for sure.
Maiko.
M-Maiko.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hi there.
Is everything okay?
It was perfect. Excellent.
You didn't give it to her?
Yeah, but if you think about it, you can't watch films at home.
I'll do it when it's on DVD.
It won't be on DVD though.
Oh, c-come on. It's okay.
Now, shall we go home?
Hey, everyone.
Why don't we have a film screening?
We can invite everyone.
Great idea.
I was a-about to say that myself.
Really?
Yeah.
-Let's do that. -Yes, let's.
All right. We're doing this!
Michael, we're ready.
Um…
Good e-evening everyone. I'm Michael.
I forced my friends to help me and we managed to complete the film.
T-This f-film has the power to revolutionize the era.
And I also think that it c-connects the past and the present.
"Films even after you died?"
That's what my friend said. But hey, whoever does it first wins.
I hope…
you enjoy the film.
So,
I have an idea for a new film.
Another one?
An autobiography.
I want to make a film about the time I've spent here.
Michael, that's my idea.
T-Then, we can do it together.
This is going to be a masterpiece.
I can't let you.
No?
Minako.
You okay?
Oh, yes.
It just hasn't sunk in yet.
Same here.
To be honest, I'm feeling a little uneasy too.
Hey, Mr. Tanaka.
Yes?
W-What is it like on the other side?
I can't tell you.
What?
Mr. Tanaka is kind of like our warden.
What? Why didn't you tell me? That's so scary.
O-Oh, come on. Tell us already.
You'll find out soon anyway.
Tanaka, you're so hard-headed.
But you know what?
Making the film was fun.
Right?
Films are great.
A bunch of grown-ups w-working passionately towards the same goal.
It's amazing.
-Yeah. -Right?
Nana.
Make more films, okay?
You can use the notes in my room.
Work hard, Nana.
Why only me?
Akira.
I'll leave the rest to you.
Make sure to keep a detailed record of this world.
You can count on me.
But you gotta stay on the offense. Don't lose, all right?
Who's he competing with?
Let's have a toast.
A toast.
Cheers.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
We still have some food left. Eat up.
Let's eat.
Could I have some of that?
-Have fried chicken too. -Okay, then one please.
Thank you.
Here's the fried…
-About this much? -Yes, thank you.
A little bit more…
…SOUND OF WAVES, AND AN EMPTY BEACH
Knock, knock.
Is everyone asleep?
Yeah.
In the end, Michael fell asleep while talking.
He really is full of energy.
Here.
Thanks.
Are you going to continue writing?
Yes.
I think I will until my dad completes his novel.
I see.
Make sure to write about me.
Of course.
You're going to be the main character.
Don't. I just want a small part.
I wanted to be with you
a little longer.
Where's this coming from?
I kind of…
liked you.
What's with that confession?
Is it weird?
Yes, it's weird.
I wonder if things would've been different
if we met when we were alive.
I guess we'll never know.
Yeah.
Akira.
Thank you. It's been fun.
Me too.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Passing it to you now.
Watch out behind you.
-Thank you. -What about this?
Right in the middle here.
All right. Yeah.
Wow, so many people.
Ryo.
-Long time no see. -Yeah.
We still have some time. You wanna go for tea?
Yeah, sure.
You've grown.
Thanks for coming.
First time in Tokyo?
Yes.
There are so many people.
Yeah, compared to that place.
Right.
Are you graduating next year?
Yes.
Do you know what you want to do?
Well, I'm not completely sure.
But I might want to do what my mom did.
Please tell me about my mom again.
Sure. Of course.
I'm looking forward to the film today.
Yeah, please do.
Nana!
It's been a while.
Oh, hi!
Long time no see.
Hello.
Thumbs up!
Thumbs up!
Tickets please.
-This way. -Theater 2, please.
I'll see you later.
Enjoy.
I'm getting nervous.
in the minds of the consumers, a genre.
But it also is an art form,
and of all the art forms of animation,
to me, the most sacred and magical
is stop-motion
because it's the bond between an animator and the puppet.
And normally, film captures reality.
Animation creates it and has to simulate the capture.
You give life to it, and that is the highest art form.
[man] What's gonna make us unique is
bringing Guillermo's live-action aesthetic to this movie.
There's a sophistication of filmmaking
that when it's applied to stop-motion, which is inherently handcrafted,
you get a really powerful combination.
[del Toro] Pinocchio is a movie that has a huge heart.
It deals with who you are, staying true to yourself,
and not having to change to be accepted.
It also is about being a father and being a son,
learning to love your family
for who they are and how they are.
Guillermo's Pinocchio is completely surprising.
He's able to Trojan horse these really big discussions
into a really entertaining family movie.
[woman] He is always looking at what it is to be human
and what it is to join a society.
That's his territory, and Pinocchio is all about that.
It's a retelling of a story you think you do know,
but you don't know.
[del Toro] The outsider aspect of Pinocchio is what attracted me to the story.
I identify with outsider creatures
like the creature of Frankenstein or Pinocchio
and having to figure out the world on your own,
that the things that you are told are not enough.
And you want to know why this is right and why this is wrong
when this feels wrong and this feels right.
To me, there is a fragility to Pinocchio being otherworldly
and people being unable to see him as a real boy
because he doesn't look like what people think a real boy should look like.
I'm a real boy!
[old man] Demon!
[woman] Witchcraft!
The magic is it's Guillermo's take on Pinocchio,
so the look of it is such a Guillermo film.
He's brought sort of the creature aspect into it
that you could only hope Guillermo would bring into Pinocchio.
But there's a real heartfelt,
sort of emotional side to the story as well.
Pinocchio!
Love hurts.
[del Toro] It took about 15 years to do Pinocchio,
and we had to assemble sort of the best team in stop-motion.
I call your attention to the miniature buttons.
-[Hayns] Yeah. -Damn, they're fine.
[Hayns laughs] They are, aren't they?
We did a three-way link between London, Portland, and Guadalajara.
I have been supporting Mexican animation since the '80s,
and we wanted to have a link with Mexico.
I wanted Mexican animators animating Pinocchio and the cricket.
Main characters because that demonstrates the great artistry and technical capacity
that a Mexican studio can have in animation.
We got some of the best animators in the world,
all under the guidance of Shadowmachine.
We embarked on an amazing process to build a stop-motion team
commensurate with the vision that Guillermo had.
[man] The depth of experience on our project was really great.
It's just tremendously exciting because,
It's just tremendously exciting because, you know, we get to be at the top of our game.
You know, we're always waiting for a script that sort of rises
You know, we're always waiting for a script that sort of rises to something that you want to service,
and this is one of those experiences.
[man] The thing that immediately caught my attention
was that it didn't look like any animated film
you've ever seen before.
Guillermo's aesthetic is woven through almost every frame of this film.
[del Toro] There's a valuable difference between stop-motion as an art form and digital.
We have seen a movement from stop-motion in the early days
where you had the moiré and the flicker of fur and fabric,
even the atmospheric dust on the sets,
and the imperfection of it was so gorgeous to look at
because it told you how the thing was done.
I really wanted this movie to land in a way
I really wanted this movie to land in a way that had the material nature of a handmade piece of animation,
an artisanal, beautiful exercise in carving, painting, sculpting,
but it had the sophistication of movement
that research on rigs and puppetry making have taken us to.
[Hayns] So, you know, my role as the puppet fabrication supervisor,
it's really getting a director like Guillermo
to trust me with his image of his movie,
and then it's the practical element of
how do we turn these inanimate objects
into fully animatable puppets?
[man] We have to plan out a lot of how it's going to move,
what it needs to do within the arc of its story.
You know, what is it going to need to be rigged on,
and how much does it weigh?
That's even a thing we have to consider.
It's a tough balance, especially when it comes to creatures,
which are certainly more cumbersome than a human character.
You've got so many fantastical, wonderful elements
that each and every one of them is hard to do,
but you have to put it together and make it work together.
[Gustafson] It's a very long process getting a puppet ready.
You know, it might take a year
to get to where you've got a finished puppet
that everyone's happy with, and it can actually go out on stage,
and then you can animate it.
[Hayns] Guillermo really wanted this to be mechanical
rather than replacement.
We have both puppets in this movie.
Replacement is every mouth shape and every expression
being a transplant.
So, its every mouth shape is a separate face mask
that sits on the puppet's face.
Pinocchio is replacement because he's a wooden boy.
[man] So, we made him act like he was made out of wood.
His face stays the same size at all times.
He doesn't have any puffy cheeks.
The wood grains in his face doesn't move around at all.
It just opens up.
I sort of described it as using a chisel to open the mouth up.
So, you just go it in one bang. There's a bit of cushion on the back end.
Bang! Open.
I think that was a stroke of genius when we all came up with that.
I was like, "Yes!"
[man] Technically speaking, it was gonna be a really difficult puppet to create.
We had to find new techniques so that you could see the character
in all its wooden form with its crude wooden joints.
We wanted it to be as practical and as durable
as a feature film would demand of a puppet of that size.
Pinocchio himself is the first puppet
fully printed out of a 3D printer.
But then Volpe and Geppetto are all mechanical.
A mechanical animation is where you have a silicone skin
sitting over what is essentially a Swiss watch of mechanisms.
With that, the animator move frame-by-frame
every element from the outside through the skin.
It's been a long process working with the animation team
to see how we would develop the techniques used for each character.
[Hayns] You know, Geppetto works so well
because he's got a big mustache and a big beard and heavy eyebrows.
And all of these things lend themselves to mechanical faces.
So, when the animator started to work with the first Carlo puppet,
it was such a struggle.
[del Toro] The more smooth the face,
the harder it is to make those expressions change.
So, the animators started relying on the lower eyelids,
on the brows, on the body language.
And especially with Carlo,
one of the things we wanted to do was
do unnecessary gestures in animation.
This was an ambassador to that
because nobody does more unnecessary gestures than a child.
[Campodonico] One of Guillermo's initial conceits was really making sure that you hold on
to the realness and the tactileness of stop-motion
and the idea that you animate mistakes.
[man] He was really stressing the realism of the performances
like little mistakes that people make all the time.
If they go to pick up a dinner plate, they maybe miss it
and go for it again.
[del Toro] In live-action, you beg for a mistake,
you beg for a line reading that is not what you expected.
This invoking of reality is very hard in stop-motion
because you are animating it, so you need to simulate those accidents.
Lift your leg.
Because he's a live-action director,
he understands the time it takes for people to process
faces and things on screen.
On this film, Guillermo really has taken the time to say
it needs to get slowed down.
We need to see Pinocchio thinking about that.
I said, "If the character is thinking,
I wanna see the eyes inputting the information."
"I want to see a subtle shift."
If you animate the ordinary,
you will achieve something extraordinary.
I co-directed with Mark Gustafson, who, for me, is
a legendary director and animator.
It's been amazing working with Guillermo because
he's an artist who's at the top of his game right now.
So, it makes you have to raise your game as well.
Guillermo's been fantastic in the way that he completely trusted the animator,
a bit like he trusts his actors.
[del Toro] Basically, the way you do a live-action is between action and cut,
the actor owns the shot.
And you make this bond with the animators,
and it gives them a lot of power to think through the puppet,
to not do an action, to avoid pantomime,
and to give us real acting.
The animators are our actors.
Animation is such an elaborate process,
and we wanted animators to own the performances.
One of the founding principles
that Guillermo and I came up with when we started this was
give the performance back to the animators as much as possible.
Part of that is them shooting these what we call LAVs, live-action videos.
[Geppetto] Do not tell lies or your nose will grow and grow…
[Hansen] Most times before you do a shot as an animator,
you would go and investigate
what kind of shape this shot is gonna have,
what kind of motion, what kind of speed.
A good and quick way to do that is just film yourself.
So, the animator would turn up with
a little video of themself doing the action.
Guillermo really loved that.
Every time he sees them, he's, like, a big smile and going, "Yeah!"
"Just like that! It's great!"
[snaps fingers] Spazzatura.
[del Toro] Gris Grimly designed an amazing Pinocchio.
To me, the best Pinocchio I've seen because it's so simple and so beautiful.
[man] When I started illustrating Pinocchio,
I just wanted him to be lanky and awkward
like a puppet without the strings.
[man] Designing Pinocchio was the main character
we wanted to get down first.
Guillermo had the wonderful idea of it being almost Frankenstein-like
in that one half is finished and one is unfinished.
[del Toro] We made him asymmetrical
because Geppetto carves him when he's drunk.
And one of the ideas is he starts with the ear and this hair,
and he's really careful with that, and then he goes, "Ah."
And kind of finishes him quick.
Geppetto was the one character that we designed the most.
We layered him out on clothing.
We made it a point to make everything he was wearing ratty.
You know, he's not a guy that can afford many pairs of pants.
[Geppetto sobs] My son.
We have to take him to a place where he's not pleasant.
I mean, this guy drinks. This guy gets angry.
This guy doesn't understand Pinocchio.
It takes him a while to realize that
his love for this boy is much more important
than doing what is socially acceptable.
Even if he's dead, I could still book him.
How dare you, sir? Show some respect!
[del Toro] The main villain in Collodi's stories,
a character called Mangiafuoco,
is a very large character,
and I had a bad feeling about it. I didn't like it.
I thought it was very much a cliché.
Guillermo called whoever was working on the show at that point,
and he looked at us, and he said, "Hey, guys."
"I think our main villain is crap, and I want to change it."
[del Toro] And I said, "I really think this should be the guy."
"Can we make him the main antagonist?"
And that was just, "Okay. All right. We've already built the villain."
-[laughing] So, what do we do? -[talking over each other]
So, what was your answer to his question?
It was one of those moments where once you see it, you can't unsee it,
and you work with the amazing team to figure it out.
[Hayns] There was a lot of time that was spent designing Mangiafuoco
with a huge beard, and this puppet,
we finished making him, and he's now a background character for the circus.
Go away! This is not a spectacle.
But it is!
Volpe is one of the more over-the-top characters.
He's really fun because he's kind of the devil.
He's very transactional.
He's just what's best for him.
One last detail to take care of.
[del Toro] When we were thinking about the cricket
I was thinking of a cricket that has traveled all over the world,
and lived with a sculptor and a barrister.
And I thought of the name
Sebastian J. Cricket.
That sounded so sophisticated.
[Gustafson] Cricket was really driven by Guillermo.
He takes this character who is a little bit arrogant,
and he makes you really like him and want to follow him.
[del Toro] The animation on the cricket is very simple in appearance,
but that means you have to be very judicious with that.
He uses the hands a lot
to explain, to…
You know, he's very righteous.
So, he uses the hands to demand an explanation,
to accuse somebody,
to signal.
He's a character that uses his whole body as a face.
[Cricket] I'm not a governess, madam.
And then, you know, it's a creature design
which is a completely different thing,
and that is Guillermo's true wheelhouse.
[del Toro] The dogfish, Death, the sprite,
the cricket, the rabbits
all have the same unworldly blue violet skin
because they are all related.
The rabbits take the dead to the other side.
And they're an extension of Death, which is the sister of life,
which is the sprite.
The concept art was never clean or stylized.
It wasn't a very polished looking like… look to a character.
They would have dirt under their fingernails.
They would have, you know, blemishes,
and it was like he wanted every character to feel like it lived a life
before in the film.
[Saunders] You know, we would create a character,
uh, make a beautiful costume, you know, for Geppetto
or one of the other characters,
and you get a message back.
Guillermo's seen it.
It's gotta look dirty. [chuckles]
You see, you make a beautiful puppet,
but it looks like it's come straight out of the shop when you finish it.
It doesn't look like it's a character in a story.
[del Toro] You don't have to believe they are real people.
You have to believe in them as characters,
and we wanted to embody the form and the character into one.
We wanted to fuse them.
Volpe with his sort of demonic, horn-like wings on the hair.
The innocence of Pinocchio, his simplicity.
The sort of earthiness and beautiful old-world grace in Geppetto.
We wanted to do a labor of design that told the story.
[Cricket] Stridulations of My Youth by Sebastian J. Cricket.
[del Toro] In terms of scale,
we use different size of puppets for different needs.
This is our Pinocchio to interact with the cricket, which is this height,
Sebastian J. Cricket.
And in order for him to be the right size in very few shots,
we need the cricket and the shoulder of Pinocchio
talking to him, whispering in his ear.
So, we use this big Pinocchio.
And then in certain shots, we use this small Pinocchio.
Then we have this
small crickets
for other shots,
particularly when he gets crushed.
The pain.
[Gustafson] You can only build a puppet so small
and still have good control over it in terms of the animation.
So we built Pinocchio as small as we could and still
have really good control over him.
And then everybody else's scale is in relation to that.
And then the sets are in relation to that.
[Enderle] Everything has to be built.
That's sort of the blessing and the curse of stop-motion.
You know, you can make things look exactly as you need them to look.
I think that's exciting
because you fully create a world
and a world that's unlike any other or very much like another.
And that's kind of really powerful.
It helps you best tell the story.
So we looked at a lot of Guillermo's films and picked up key things.
Colors, textures,
shapes of windows, and just general atmosphere.
You can probably tell within three seconds that you're watching a Guillermo film,
and we wanted that to be true of this.
[Bradley] The sets are evocative
of the beauty of these little Italian towns,
and I know places just like this.
[del Toro] We did a huge amount of research.
Photographs and posters, we copied typography
because I wanted the world to feel real.
All the structures in the town
have the remnants of their origins
like medieval ruins, and then on top of that
you have 18th-century carvings,
and then you have murals that were frescoes from the 1500s, 1400s.
So, it feels layered.
[man] Once you're translating script to storyboards,
those decisions can define how massive the vision can be,
and you can make choices in story where you put the camera,
how much the camera's moving.
[Gustafson] One of the unique challenges that we have is
the animator has to actually be able to get in
and reach the puppets and animate.
So, we have to design these sets
so that they can be pulled apart in many different ways.
It's all a big, like, teamwork, and we're all sitting there together
talking about how this is gonna look.
The film looks a certain way,
and then the animation needs to fit into that world as well.
[Gustafson] Early on, you have to find out the aesthetic,
like exactly what it is.
And we'll base it on something very simple.
You know, we have a pine cone in the movie that,
it's a… it's a charming little… little object,
and we looked at it over and over for months at different intervals,
and we would look at other things through the lens of
like how did we make this pine cone? We like this look.
If you know how the lines of a simple, organic pine cone works,
you start to learn the line language
and the level of detail and the level of reality
that we're trying to infuse into this movie.
You just kind of get a feel for what this world looks like.
[DeSue] The Death puppet left room for certain aspects to be explored.
Yeah. 'Cause I mean, I think originally the Death, we had the snake tail,
and it was you and Toby
saw that scaling as a pine cone texture. And that was so brilliant.
It was a great way of tying it into the pine cone that Death represented
every living thing.
[Gustafson] There were some pants for Spazzatura.
And the line in the pants…
-Had to be handmade. -It had to be handmade.
But it didn't wanna be overt, you know.
It wanted to feel real in a sense,
but it sort of reflected into everything else,
this notion of it's not perfect.
It's got a character to it.
[DeSue] We'd all seen the sample. It had come from Mackinnon and Saunders.
They gave us a swatch board. If we can handle these stripes nine ways.
Here's ones that we like, and we were all, "That one."
And we laughed. We're like, "We all agree."
"That's so great. It must be that one."
Then the next step was to talk about well, why?
Because if you talk about why,
then maybe those rules can inform other things.
[Death] There are rules, you see.
[Gustafson] We had to find the language of it,
how cartoony is it, how real is it.
And there was sort of a sweet spot I think we landed in.
Having a magical element like Pinocchio
required that we had a more grounded world around Pinocchio.
If everything is magical, nothing is magical.
We needed to ground the world. Proportions needed to be correct.
The physics needed to be correct.
It provided stakes for the emotional story and arc of Pinocchio.
Guillermo has a very good eye for that.
He notices when something is not going to fit into the world.
[del Toro] This is no different than designing
and decorating a full-size,
live-action movie set.
That's the beauty of stop-motion animation.
Set dec, set design, decoration,
cinematography, they're completely like a live-action film.
Guillermo's very concerned that things feel and look real.
And so we do reference a lot of period images if we can find them.
[del Toro] For example, this interior.
If you imagined that the main source of energy was coal
and wood, we stained all the walls with coal stains.
So you have to really run it not by a design machine,
but as a reality machine.
[Enderle] I remember one of his first visits. He was looking at the church set
that we had just sort of barely gotten together by the time he got here,
and he was like, "Yes. We should age the hell out of this." [chuckles]
[del Toro] We started with the fact that churches took decades, if not centuries
to be completed.
So, the woodwork would be a little lighter than the frescoes on the walls,
or the stained-glass windows would be of a different decade or a century,
and the carving of the Christ took a while.
It needed to feel like the same handiwork
of all the other stuff in Geppetto's household.
You needed to feel the shaving of the wood, the shape,
which I wanted to have a parallel with Pinocchio being carved of wood
and Pinocchio has a hard time figuring out
why the townspeople hate him
if he's made of wood and they love Him,
as he says, who is also made of wood.
So, that point could only be done at the church.
My only worry on this movie was
will I have enough motion control kit
to do all the camera movement that Guillermo will expect on this movie.
Because the later Guillermo films, the camera just doesn't stop.
[del Toro] We wanted to stage with the characters moving around on the camera,
moving around the way you would stage with actors on a set.
In some instances, we move the camera quite a bit.
For example, one single shot took three months.
[Passingham] There's a shot where Spazzatura is headed back to the carnival
where he sort of runs down, and the camera follows him
traversing the carnival grounds
and ending up in Volpe's wagon.
[Passingham] A shot like that, it tells you so much
'cause you really see the way that Spazzatura moves.
It tells you something about his character.
It also tells you about the environment that he's from.
It tells you about the circus.
And we also get to meet some of the other characters
who are in the background as he sort of passes through.
A lot of Guillermo's movies are hyperreality.
So, you use the light
just to accent the emotional content of a scene,
so having some cloud movement is such an assist for telling the story.
Like with Geppetto when he is chopping down the tree.
It helps to reflect Geppetto's agonized state,
so we can really amp up the drama.
One of the things which we had not done before
was when Volpe is burning Pinocchio on the fire.
We were able to have a torch with LED lights inside the torch,
so that as Volpe moves the torch around,
we were able to have a separate pass for that light
and to give it multiple exposures.
Give me that torch, Spazzatura.
Because normally, you'd always have to fake that up
with moving lights or stage,
and this was an opportunity for us
to really control that in the post process.
We could keep the moonlight separate
and just have all of that torch light and fire light
on separate passes.
You will burn. Burn bright!
Like a star!
-[Volpe laughs evilly] -[Pinocchio] Ow! Help!
[Hayns] It's amazing how the character designs and the actors themselves
inform each other,
and then the actual animator informs it as well.
By the time that the animator gets the puppet,
the animator has the voice tracks.
[del Toro] The thing with Pinocchio that I love
is the idea of it embodying
any four-year-old, six-year-old that are balls of energy
-that nobody can control. -[Cricket] Oh!
[del Toro] When they're sad, you understand they're sad,
and they can be on the verge of tears one second
and incredibly happy two seconds later.
As we came to find out with Gregory,
you have a very short lifespan in the recording sessions,
but it was all true.
[boy] My process at the beginning, I was very nervous.
I've never done
anything where I was a really big, substantial part in the movie.
It was like shooting a documentary.
Whenever he started acting,
we did a little thing that… [chuckles]
…it was very easy for him to shake out the acting.
I said… I would say he would call me a dummy.
He said that if I said "dummy" at the end of a line,
even though we wouldn't probably put it in the final cut,
it made me put a lot more emphasis into it,
especially on some of the funnier lines.
And every time he got a little too actory,
he would say, "Shut up, dummy!"
And then he would laugh it out, and he would continue.
I'm made of flesh and bone and meaty bits.
I'm a real boy.
He's really good at being natural,
but he is incredibly intimate when he's whispering
or talking to the cricket
or talking to Candlewick.
There is an absolute pure emotion there.
Fathers feel despair, like everyone else.
And they say things they only think they mean in the moment.
But inside they love you.
[del Toro] Well, I think this is my third project with David Bradley,
and it's because I admire him very much.
I think he's an actor that has an easily identifiable sound.
No one talks to the Podestà like that.
I approached the script by finding some kind of vocal quality
that was believable and truthful,
[grittier voice] but something that tells the story and it's more vivid
and more capturing
the essence of this character.
He goes high, and he goes low really fast. [imitating] "Why are you saying that?"
You know, he really is…
It's almost like a musical thing he has.
A son knows when his father is alive.
He will look for us. You'll see.
You have nothing to worry about. [coughs]
I wasn't convinced of Cricket when we started the film.
Just as a character.
As soon as Ewan started voicing it, I was like, "Okay. I'm on board."
I can't believe it!
[del Toro] I'm a massive fan of Ewan McGregor,
and when he talks, he's so relatable but warm.
And I said, "We cannot have enough of this voice."
Well, I've tried my best,
and that's the best anyone can do.
Pinocchio taught me that.
And I thought that should be the main character of the film,
the narrator character.
And we rewrote the scenes emphasizing the cricket
even if he was just watching.
I think the sessions with Ewan have been the best character voice sessions
I've ever had in my life.
I am Count Volpe. You have been chosen!
Come partake in the fun, fanciful, carefree carnival life
as the star of my puppet show.
[del Toro] We knew that Volpe needed to be glitzy, cosmopolitan, appealing,
sound like a man of the world.
We wanted him to have an accent,
but have a voice that could pronounce flawlessly
a word in French, a word in Italian, a word in German.
Puppets are le meilleur qui soit. The tops!
Lift your arm.
Puppets are well respected in every station of life.
The only voice that came to mind was Christoph Waltz.
Talk about a guy that can change
the rhythm and the intention of a sound in mid-phrase.
[Waltz] That's a dramatic function, so to say.
And I always look for the function in the story.
He really knows how to vary things
and then just punch at the right moment.
-[clattering] -What are you doing here?
The voice of Spazzatura, which will come as a big surprise,
was almost a blessing and an accident that I could not foresee.
We were shooting Nightmare Alley.
Cate Blanchett and I were having such a good time
that she said, "You gotta give me a part on Pinocchio."
I go, "The only part left is a monkey."
And I went, "I would do anything."
"I would play a pencil in a movie for you."
[del Toro] And I showed her the design for Spazzatura, and she said,
"I think this is my spirit animal."
When Spazzatura gets shot out of the sky,
do you want a little [squeaky moan].
Like in the distance.
I think there's something of Guillermo's laugh… [chuckles deeply]
…that's in Spazzatura.
But I think all the characters in Guillermo's movies,
all of us feel that they're in the eye of Guillermo as the beholder.
So, I think there's probably qualities of Guillermo
in all of the characters. And Spazzatura is, yeah, case in point.
[Pinocchio singing] ♪ Ciao, Papa Mio papa… ♪
[Blanchett] Normally, when you're watching a piece of animation which has music in it,
you can feel the songs coming up.
It's almost like the dialogue is a ramp for the music.
♪ No one knows, no one can tell… ♪
[Blanchett] Whereas the songs spring out of Guillermo's Pinocchio
completely by surprise.
These puppets gave me the desire of not
doing an animation movie, but doing like a real live-action film.
It's the same for me 'cause they look alive.
They all look like real people.
So, I tried the music to be playing like it was a real person's.
We like to describe this not necessarily as a musical.
It's a film with musical moments.
They're not traditional musical songs, they're not pop songs.
They're just sort of what you would think of, if you think
of Alexandre and Guillermo and Mark.
All those genius minds together is something totally unique.
When Alexandre and I were talking, I thought it would be interesting
to start the movie with characters that sing
but end up…
The second half of the movie has fascist-era songs and marches.
This movie was a very long process
because, of course, the animation takes a lot of time,
but also because
Guillermo wanted me to write songs for the characters,
and a song has this capacity
in a few seconds to explain the life of a character.
They give the tone musically.
Also, they give information about who they are, where they are,
where they come from, and where they're going.
I admire Alexandre Desplat.
He is a consummate movie composer.
He does the same thing that I do with parts.
He looks at the story.
[Desplat] For the whole film, I've chosen to use only wood instruments.
So, you have the guitars, the mandolin,
the piano, the harp, and all the woodwinds.
The bassoons, the clarinets, the oboes, the flutes.
All these instruments are in wood
which creates a very strange environment that belongs to Pinocchio.
No!
[del Toro] This movie, you could watch in a double program
with Pan's and Devil's Backbone easily.
It has a lot of elements with a pure soul being tested
and coming out on the other side strong.
[Death] As I see it, you were charged with a burden.
This is a film about death.
You don't have a film about life if you don't have a film about death.
[Wood Sprite] Very well then.
[del Toro] When we started to tackle this Pinocchio,
I knew I wanted to do my own version.
I didn't want to address just an adaptation.
I wanted to talk about things that touched me personally very deeply.
Most of my movies, one way or another, deal with me and my father,
and this is not an exception.
[Froud] You watch this boy grow up, never physically changing.
But yet,
the realization that he can do far more than anyone else around him.
[Death] Now, make the most of it.
[del Toro] Normally, Pinocchio is about what Pinocchio learns in the world
and then becomes a good boy and therefore becomes a real boy,
and our Pinocchio is not that.
He changes everyone because he is so pure.
He changes Geppetto.
He changes the cricket.
He changes Spazzatura. He changes everyone.
And he learns who he is as a human being.
I think the film exceeded everything I wanted.
It's a movie I would've loved to have as a kid.
It's a movie I'd love to have as an adult.
It's a movie I would love to have to discuss with the family,
and the possibility of seeing it on command
after experiencing it for the first time,
it's something that creates an intimate bond
between the viewer and the film.
THE EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS MOVIE ARE FICTITIOUS.
LUANG AWUTWISET

I'M WAITING AT YOUR HOUSE.
JUST A SECOND. I'M GETTING OFF FROM THE MRT.
IF YOU'RE NOT HERE IN 10 MINUTES, I'M LEAVING.
HOLD ON. I'LL GIVE YOU A DISCOUNT ON ANY PIECE YOU LIKE.
Has this house been sold already?
Yes.
I didn't get a good price for it.
But I don't know why I'd keep it.
But this one, Noon.
It's the gun of Luang Awutwiset.
My family heirloom.
From Rama III era.
He was the owner of Thailand's first department store.
Here. Take a look at this.
Noon.
Do you see this wooden box in this photo?
It's the same one.
This is a picture of the grandparents of my great-great-great grandma.
If you want it, I'll throw in this picture too.
They're your ancestors.
Keep it to pay respects.
As for the gun…
LUANG AWUTWISET
I'll give you 500,000.
Well, that sounds okay, but…
let me go talk with my mom first.
She's really possessive of it.
Tell your mom I can go up to 600,000.
650,000 then.
MRS. LEELAWADEE HUNTRAKUL
Mom.
I know the gun has a long history.
But, he really is giving a great price, Mom.
It's enough to buy a car.
But, if you're not okay,
then send me a signal.
Whether it be a strong wind, thunder, or make something fall.
You're okay with it?
Well…
I'm going to sell it then.
What?
What?
What?
Come on.
Why?
What?

The newsletter stated this.
This means the Express
is close to arriving to Siam, am I right, sir?
Sir.
Sir.
I just bought this from a Chinese merchant at the market.
Father Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix.
Could you please pay attention to what I'm saying, sir?
Sure.
Come take a look at this, Miss Gaysorn.
What language is this?
It's not Khmer.
I'm not sure if it's Siamese.
Take a look. Can you read it or not?
They're Siamese characters, sir.
But it's written in a strange manner.
"My name is Ketsurang."
"I'm a fourth-year archeology student."
"I'm a bit on the plus-size kind of girl."
"And in the year of 2018 C.E.,
I traveled back in time…"
"I'm now in the body of Lady Karaket,
the most beautiful…
just like Miss Grand…
Ayutthaya!"
"Ayutthaya…"
Must mean the city Ayutthaya.
But, "traveled back in time…"
What does this mean, sir?
"Darn. Freaking cool."
"Dej got promoted
to Khun Sriwisarnwaja."
This journal is very interesting indeed.
Will you please study it and tell me about it later?
Yes, sir.
Dej!
Karaket, my love.
Are thou secretly writing about me?
This is my personal journal. You aren't allowed to read it.
No!
Bhop.
Are you awake yet, son?
Not yet, Mother.
Then who is it that is answering me?
I think it's time for you to meet your fiancée.
You've been stalling for years.
You have never seen her in person.
Do you remember?
Your father had tied your lifeline with Gaysorn's.
If you both marry each other, your lives will continue on.
But if not…
Either you or Gaysorn will die.
The lifeline will be cut.
If it is you who were to die, then how could I continue to live?
I intended to go meet my betrothed today anyway.
CHIEF SOMBATBORDI'S RESIDENCE
POLICE COLONEL'S RESIDENCE
Chief Sombatbordi.
You should have sent word that you were coming.
Today, Gaysorn isn't at home.
She's gone to study at the church since the early morning.
It's a pity that the two of you have not met yet.
That's all right, sir.
I'm here to meet with you, actually.
Four years ago,
my parents and you
verbally betrothed Gaysorn and I to each other.
However, I was engaged with work.
I had to build the main temple at Prib Pri city.
When I came back to the capital,
I had to construct the pagoda at Prayun Temple.
Thus I never had the chance to meet with Gaysorn.
I…
would like to ask to…
break off our engagement.
I don't find it amusing, Pi.
Next time I'll take you to see something more amusing.
What is it, miss?
A steamboat from England. It's made entirely of steel,
but it floats in water.
Miss.
Any ship is the same.
Let's watch the play.
This Prince's royal performing ensemble is the best ensemble in the capital, miss.
How can you like this?
Phra Aphai Mani is ever the ladies' man.
If I wrote the story, I'd have the giantess eat him.
Will you please be quiet?
I can't understand what's going on.
Who is it?
Just some man.
He's good-looking, but his brows are knitted together.
He seems to be a regular here, miss.
Tell him to cover his ears.
Cover your ears, sir.
Tell the person next to you to cover her mouth.
How rude.
People are watching the show.
Let's go home, Pi.
I've got chills.
Yes, miss.
What is thy name?
Who are thy parents? Where is thy residence?
Why are you using the word "thy"?
You sound so ancient.
Then by what name shall I call thee?
I haven't learned thy name yet.
My name is Viola. My sister's name is Fiddle.
Our mother's name is Violin.
Our father's name is Cello. We're a string ensemble.
You two are good at fiddling around.
And for what reason is thy sister dressed as a helper?
My sister likes to disguise herself.
That's right.
Or else we won't be able to leave the house.
Men are waiting to kidnap me as I am quite the beauty.
Then thou must not have disguised thyself.
Seeing as thou art as beautiful as the sunset.
Let me tell you something for your own good.
My lady is already betrothed.
He's a Chief-ranking official.
Is he Mis-Chief or Handker-Chief?
Chief Sombatbordi.
Thou art Gaysorn?
The daughter of the Police Colonel?
How do you know?
I am…
Chief Sombatbordi.
You're my fiancé?
Yes.
This morning I just went to thy house.
Did you arrange for the wedding day already?
I went to…
…break off our engagement.
How could you say such a thing?
If you do not wed
and if Gaysorn's lifeline is cut off,
who will be responsible?
I will not allow you to break off the engagement.
I will not allow it, no matter what!
But I want to.
At first, I also wanted to.
But…
…I have my eye on someone else, sir.
Even if I must die,
I really am not able to wed Gaysorn.
I despise men
who do not keep their promises.
You must be hiding mistresses away in the other cities.
It's good that my daughter will not have you as her husband!
Madam.
You say such things about my son…
And what about your daughter?
What woman
dresses up and styles her hair in such a peculiar way?
Why does she not wear her hair like the other women?
All she does is study foreign subjects.
Such a peculiar woman as her is not wife material.
That's why you tied her fortune with my son!
Then you best mind the life of your son.
Who knows when his time will come?
It's your daughter who must be careful.
I'll be waiting to see whose child will be the first to go!
Hey! Just tell me if the engagement is broken off or not?
That's enough.
If you want to break off the engagement, then do so.
Don't you ever show your face around here again.
Don't even dare to row your boat past my pier!
Please tell me that thou art Viola.
The daughter of Cello.
You've been building temples for many years,
yet you don't have enough blessings.
Oh, destiny…
Why are you so mean to me?
My destiny must be like Usaren,
whom Pra Aphai Mani stole his fiancé away from him.
It's not the same.
How so?
Usaren had his fiancé taken from him, but you're just a plain fool.
You broke up with her first.
Uncle Phu, you wrote this story.
Then you can change the ending.
Make Usaren reunite with Suwanmali.
Rewrite it now.
So the dancers can rehearse the new dance.
If I changed it, people would burn down my house.
This is Phra Aphai Mani's story.
The protagonist has to win it all.
What now?
Uncle, you just went treasure hunting.
Did you get any magical items
that can help me get re-engaged to Gaysorn?
Well…
You know everything.
Take your pick then.
Every piece is sacred and magical.
No. This one you can't have.
It's off limits.
This is the Krishna-Kali scripture.
According to ancient records,
it's used to put curses on people who think and does evil.
If they are cursed using these chants, they will die.
Uncle Phu.
Is there any magical item that will turn back time?
I want to go back to four years ago.
And I would not go anywhere else.
I would rush to see Gaysorn quickly.
All right.
There's only one way.
You need to use this.
My nipple?
Your heart!
Goodness.
Be careful, miss.
Chuen, row as fast as you can.
Yes, miss.
You can go home first.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to the church.
Pi.
What shall I do to not see this smiling face again?
He hovers around just like a fly.
Miss.
Let's do this.
We have to make the Chief see that you are a wicked person.
Self-centered, unpredictable, fussy, and bossy.
Wait.
Is this a plan or your inner thoughts?
Oh, miss, the Chief is looking at us.
You have to slap me, miss.
Let him see that you slap your help for no reason.
What?
Quickly. Just slap me.
I can't do that.
I love you just like a sister.
Miss! Slap me.
You want that Smiley as your…
Pi.
He didn't see it.
Slap me again.
I think we should change the method.
Slap now!
Miss, slapping isn't enough.
You have to scold me really badly and very loudly for the Chief to hear.
I can't. I think it's enough.
If it's going to be this tough, it'd be better to just be honest with him.
Just scold me!
Spew out any curses.
The Chief must hate and fear you.
I can't do it!
You have to!
You must…
Pi, you!
-Chief. He is watching… -Chucklehead!
Ratbag!
You wench!
Pi.
Did the Chief see it?
I think he did, miss.
Dost thou study here?
You fool!
Take this artifact away.
I'm going to go study!
Buffoon!
Do you want to change sides?
The same side is better.
Leave the other one for me to chew, please.
-You! -I know thou art pretending.
Sir.
Where is the chest that keeps the Lady's journal?
I'm going to continue studying.
This man is your destiny. Am I right?
The fiancé you wish to never meet.
What?
Dej-ti-ny?
Sir.
The chest, please.
I heard that you have built many temples.
Oh, yes, sir.
Sir.
May I have the key to the chest, please?
Key?
Oh, the key.
I guess I forgot it in my room.
I better go get it.
Art thou mad that I broke off our engagement?
Stop calling me thou.
Who uses that word anymore? So strange.
Oh, if thou dost not want me to call thee thou,
what dost thou want me to call thee then?
Dost thou know?
I have dreamed of thee for so many years.
We are absolutely destined to be together.
Had I known that thou were betrothed to me,
I would not have ever broken off the engagement.
Dost thou loathe me
to the point thou will not turn to look at me?
I'm not mad that you broke off the engagement
because I never wanted to be engaged to you.
I used our engagement as an excuse to continue my studies here.
Pallegoix has been kind enough to teach me.
I hadn't planned to study for long.
But now I can speak English well.
Four years! Where have you been?
Is it that you're plain rude or do you disdain me?
Which is why you never came to meet me?
Oh, no. I apologize.
I'm sorry for letting thee wait so long.
May I ask for us to be engaged once more?
Do you believe we are destined to be together?
If so, could you wait?
Of course.
No matter how long, I will wait.
Wait until our next life then.
THE BRITISH FACTORY
ROYAL TREASURY PIER
Miss.
Take it easy.
If you fall into the water, it'll be a big mess.
Pi, hurry.
Rumor has it that angels built it, so this iron ship can float in water.
A monk's alms bowl can also float in water.
You're so gullible.
The ship is enormous, just as rumored, Mr. Hunter.
The bill of sale.
Wasn't the price you gave at first at 50,000 dollars?
Why has the price increased to 67,000?
The ship was stranded in a storm in Singapore,
Minister of the Royal Treasury.
Therefore, it had to use more coal.
I didn't raise the price without any reason.
Siam ordered this steamboat to wage war with Cochinchina.
But now the war is nearing an end.
This iron ship of yours is…
beautiful…
Absolutely beautiful.
Chief Sombatbordi.
Go wash your face to sober up.
And quickly inspect the steamboat now.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Hunter.
Let's go talk inside.
Miss!
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
My goodness. How did this happen?
Be careful. Come, miss.
Are you all right?
I'm not hurt…
Hey!
Are you in pain?
No.
But I'm afraid of blood.
What to do?
Let me do it, miss.
Here.
Darn. Freakin' cool.
DARN. FREAKIN' COOL.
Here.
Let me help you.
Oh, dear.
You are all sweaty as if you lost your hand.
Let's get up, miss.
Let's go. You got all dirty.
Are you all right?
Is this yours?
Oh, yes.
Thank you for picking it up for me.
Who are you?
Why did you bring a pistol here?
Chief.
You're not the police.
You don't have the authority to arrest anyone.
Let him go right now.
But this is the Royal Treasury's area.
I have the authority to interrogate strangers who bring in a weapon.
What is your relation to Gaysorn?
Why were you smiling so sweetly at each other?
Chief!
You're not my fiancé anymore. Don't act like this.
If you're going to interrogate him, do it now.
"Luang Awutwiset."
That's the title given to Mr. Hunter.
This pistol isn't yours.
My name is Mathus.
I've been working at Hunter's British Factory for three years.
Don't you lie to me.
Someone with your looks, could work with Westerners?
What did he say?
He's Hunter's assistant.
He's good at what he does.
Hunter gave him the gun as a present.
This is a royal gift bestowed by the King.
There's no way Hunter would give it away.
You stole it, didn't you?
What?
Chief!
What is this?
Did you smuggle it over the border?
These are called sunglasses.
Hard material as such must be a weapon
for throwing at people, correct?
No.
It's not a weapon.
It's a mobile phone.
"Mobile phone"?
I'm not a thief.
It's my duty to inspect the steamboat today.
All right. I will let you go.
But I will keep all of these things to ask Mr. Hunter about them first.
But the pistol is broken…
Do you want to leave or go to prison with this pistol of yours?
Go.
Move.
Go.
Hello, Ma'am.
Wow!
It smells so nice and looks so good.
What curry did you cook?
"Wary" curry.
Beef "wary" curry.
Mother asked me to come and apologize
to you for saying things she shouldn't have.
I also have something that's hard to find.
It's grape juice from abroad, ma'am.
It strangely burns my throat.
Are you sure this is grape juice?
Ma'am.
But it has medicinal benefits.
Ever since Mother drank this grape juice,
when the night falls, Father has not gotten any sleep.
Can I have another glass?
Sure, ma'am.
Refreshing.
Ma'am.
I won't have any.
Just a little.
To boost your blood circulation
and have the strength to rock the boat all night long.
What?
Have you come back already?
Bhop, my dear son.
Bhop, my dear master-to-be.
Where is your lady?
Yes!
I've been looking for you!
What art thou looking for?
The pistol, of course.
Don't stare at me. I won't be swayed.
Move back.
Shoot me.
So I can die and I will wait for thee in the next life.
I'm the Police Colonel's daughter. Don't think I won't dare.
I know that thou dare to.
But, it doesn't have any bullets.
That's my pistol.
CHIEF SOMBATBORDI
That person with the strange name told thee to steal the pistol back?
Thou art quiet.
This means thou admit.
I will tell the police to arrest
that guy with the strange name.
His name…
I want the pistol you took from the man whose name is Mathus…
Mathus!
To trade with something.
Just tell us the truth.
And he will return everything to you.
I saw the word "mobile phone" in Lady Karaket's journal,
which was written in King Narai's time.
"Let me complain a bit."
"I really miss Mom and Grandma."
"It'd be great if I had my mobile phone here."
Lady Karaket called this journal Records of Ket's Krungsri.
She wrote the records for the next generation
to know what will happen to our country.
Did she write what year she came from?
2018 C.E.
I'm from 2021,
which is 177 years from now.
This pistol took me back in time here.
I was surprised and flipped out.
I asked locals where the MRT was.
They must have thought I was a foreigner,
so they took me to Hunter's British Factory.
When Lady Sap,
Mr. Hunter's wife found out I could speak English,
she put me to work at the store.
I usually sold things online in my time.
Oh, in simple words,
I was kind of a merchant, so it's not hard for me.
Shortly, Mr. Hunter entrusted me…
to become his right-hand man.
What?
Oh, I mean…
I was promoted to his assistant, overseeing the sales for him sometimes.
I then realized
that I came back to the time of my ancestors.
My family name is Huntrakul.
Well…
it's likely to originate from Hunter.
Family name?
Is it like Westerners' surname?
Let's say you married me.
Your full name would be Gaysorn Huntrakul.
Hey!
You can't say such things.
It's not proper.
All right then.
Let's say you were my son.
Your name would be
Bhop Huntrakul.
Gosh!
There's no way I will ever be your child.
So?
Why are you wasting your time smelling the flowers here?
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
I've tried doing so.
For the past three years,
I haven't told anyone about traveling back in time.
I fired the pistol at Prayun Temple so many times…
without any success.
Because there's one thing that isn't the same.
The solar eclipse.
Rahu swallowing the sun?
Oh, yes.
Rahu swallowing the sun.
But…
I don't know when Rahu will swallow the sun again.
So I carry the pistol around with me everyday.
If there was Google, it'd be great.
Goo…
What?
It's a guru of everything.
It will answer all your questions.
I know someone who has answers to everything.
Another two…
Two days?
Two months.
Another two months, Rahu will swallow the sun.
What?
Oh, but Rahu will swallow the sun just for a short moment.
If you miss this chance,
I can't tell you when there will be another one.
I have an idea.
Before Mathus returns home,
sir,
may I have permission to let Mathus read it?
Mathus can read the words in this journal fluently.
"Now we're in Rama III era."
"It's the golden age of foreign trade."
"Especially trade with the Chinese."
"Lots of money was earned by the Royal Treasury."
"This is called the Red Purse Money."
This is very interesting.
Let me take a look.
Oh, okay.
Oh, a girl with glasses.
So beautiful.
Lady Karaket also has records of Mr. Hunter.
Father Pallegoix is also in it.
"Pallegoix
who wrote the four-language dictionary…"
I don’t want to know about myself.
Oh, wait.
And I also think that you all
should not know about things that haven't happened yet.
But Lady Karaket wanted us to know, sir.
She wrote the records for us.
Miss Gaysorn.
Return the key to me.
If you don't listen to me, don't come to study with me anymore.
I prohibit you all from studying this journal.
Miss Gaysorn, keep it in the cabinet.
Even if it's a bad event, if it's God's will,
we have to let it happen.
THE PRINCE'S PALACE
No matter what,
I think we should buy the ship from Mr. Hunter.
Who knows when the colonial troops of the Westerners will arrive at Siam?
A number of their spies are secretly disguised among us already.
Our naval fleet should have the ship and the newest weaponry
to defend ourselves.
I must ask a favor from you, Phra Surasawad,
the Royal Advisor to the Prince whom he highly trusts,
to please advise the Prince
to see the advantages of purchasing this ship.
I won't buy it.
When the Advisor and Minister of Treasury proposed me to buy this ship,
I've doubted how an iron steamboat
can really float on water and move on its own.
And your ship arriving so late… Who knows?
You might have modified junk and towed it from England to Siam.
And now, you have the nerve to raise the price.
I won't buy it…
Now the ship has arrived.
If you don't believe the steamboat really can move on its own,
all you have to do
is go out and take a look for yourself!
I don't believe you.
And I'm not going out there to look.
And I…
won't buy your ship.
Let go of him, Khun.
You are fraudsters.
The Siamese are cheats.
They don't keep their promises.
I'm going to tell the British navy to bring warships
to close off the Gulf of Siam.
Whoa!
Hold on, Mr. Hunter.
Get dressed properly first.
I have a solution to dispel any doubts about
whether a ship made of steel will float and move on its own or not.
I would like to ask for your permission to board the ship
to study the design and structure of the ship in detail
so that I can make a functioning miniature
and use it to prove to the Prince where he can see it for himself.
Chief Sombatbordi is the best craftsman of the Royal Treasury.
He has the expertise in mechanical engines and chemistry.
Advisor, what are your thoughts?
I agree to this.
I hope you will be successful
in building a miniature steamboat according to plan.
Yes, sir.
Imagine a crocodile coming from the right,
turn the steering wheel to the left.
But if it's coming from the left,
turn the steering wheel to the right.
I don't see why there has to be a crocodile.
If I want to go left, I steer left.
If I want to go right, I steer right. It's easier to understand.
Let me try.
It's heavy.
It's hard for you.
Mathus, I want to look at the steam engine.
Can you take me to see it?
What's wrong with him?
What is this table?
Is it to calculate the ship's route?
It's a game called tic-tac-toe.
The captain must have been bored, so he played it to pass the time.
And the two T's,
what does it mean?
I REALLY MISS MOM AND GRANDMA.
Oh, it's a symbol.
It's like a crying face.
Hey.
Ouch!
It's just a cramp.
Bear with it.
Hey.
Can I ask you a question?
What are your intentions with Gaysorn?
Don't lie.
Well…
I like her.
She's someone I want to go out with.
Someone you want to go out with?
What does that mean?
In my era, it's normal for men and women to hang out.
You don't have to overthink things.
Miss Gaysorn is a sweet person.
Anyone who meets her would have to like her.
But I'm going to return home.
I won't court her.
Honestly, your method doesn't work.
Hey, how about this?
Wear these sunglasses first.
I guarantee it'll make girls go crazy for you.
ASSUMPTION CHURCH
WORKSHOP
You go over there.
When you are working on the miniature ship is the best time.
The first step is to bombard her with "likes" to show your love.
What?
Do we need to use a bomb?
What can we use in this era to express your love for her?
You used flowers just like the 'heart' button in IG?
Awesome!
It's more like awful.
An awful failure.
Come on.
Don't get discouraged.
Let's keep on going.
The second method is called take care and take her heart.
Have some water, sir.
-Water… -Art thou tired?
Let me pass it for thee.
Art thou tired?
Let me do it for thee.
Art thou tired? I'll turn it for thee.
Is this the page?
Or is it this one?
-Art thou tired? -Will you please stop asking?
The next step is the most important.
This is the death step.
Because it's the way you fade out to make her anxious.
I'm really tired of your funny wording.
You'll have to disappear to make her worried.
And how can I disappear
when I have to build the ship here?
Let's just say do whatever you can.
Just don't let Gaysorn see your face.
Keep on rowing.
Yes, sir.
Doesn’t he come here to build the miniature?
Right, miss.
Why is he passing by this way then?
When she hasn't seen your face for a few days,
she will come to you and ask…
What's wrong, Chief?
I'm not free to talk right now.
I'm not free in the evening either.
I'm meeting with a friend at the market.
I'm not free to escort thee home either.
Oh, the friend is a girl.
I didn't know someone like you had friends.
And a girl friend too.
Who is she?
I have someone I go-went-gone out with.
Just, "go out with."
But I haven't decided on anything yet.
It's not anything serious.
I've stopped believing in destiny already.
No wonder why you've been acting strange lately.
So you've finally stopped believing in destiny.
I'm happy for you, Chief.
Congrats.
Mathus.
Want some mangoes?
Your hand is dirty.
It's all right. I'll feed you.
Thanks, Gaysorn.
Mathus!
I will heat the boiler.
The steam will flow through the pipes to the piston valves,
pressing them to move up and down,
rotating the axle that is attached to the paddle.
And this is how the pressure used to move the ship happens.
Why is the paddle moving so fast?
It's nothing.
My machine is just that powerful.
Watch out!
Are the two of you all right?
You don't have to get the doctor.
I can ask one of the helps to dress my wound.
Hi.
The doctor is here.
It's gone in quite deep.
It will need to be stitched up.
Emelie.
Chief.
You don’t have to be afraid.
In my time, Dr. Bradley is very famous.
He's acclaimed as the father of Thai printing.
And what does it have to do with my treatment?
Doctor.
Your newspaper is called Bangkok Recorder, right?
I've been looking for a name for the newspaper.
Good but, please stitch up the wound first.
If you fell the other way,
your butt wouldn't have been stabbed like this.
It's good
that I…
covered you two.
If not the pole…
The pole might have stabbed you.
Instead of going home…
You might have been a ghost haunting
the church here.
Doctor.
Can you take it easy?
Just one more.
Oh, he's detailed.
You are unharmed.
And Gaysorn is safe.
It's my blessing.
You really are a rare item.
Rare…
Rare what?
Ouch!
Oh, he's pulling no punches.
Is it painful?
Bhop.
"Bhop."
Ouch!
Ouch.
Bhop.
What's wrong with your hands?
Does it hurt?
May I take a look?
Red ginger lily.
People in the old days said it means unchanging love.
If it's the old saying, then it might not be true now.
But at this moment,
thy cheeks are as red as the lily.
And your face is now so big that the lily can't hide it.
They're flirting.
Art thou using
the "take care and take my heart" method with me?
Oh, he just planted an entire tree.
This time it's orchids.
What does it mean?
It means
a man's blooming love towards a woman who is dear to him,
but won't accept him yet.
Did people in the old days clearly state that?
It is my own saying.
No one from the old days said it.
Chief is infatuated with you already.
If he has a taste of your dessert, he'll be head over heels in love
as if he drinks a love potion.
I only know how to make this.
Take it.
Yes, miss.
Oh, really?
Is it too fast?
I think it's too late even.
I've wanted to marry Gaysorn since we first met.
Don't be too obvious, miss.
Can I ask you something?
What makes you sure Gaysorn is the right one?
I have
dreamed of her for over ten years.
I've only dreamed of her.
How could it not be?
So you like her
just because she reminds you of your ex?
It's not just that they look alike.
It's as if they're the same person!
If this is your answer,
I, as a bridesmaid, won't allow this to pass.
I'd tell you to go daydreaming.
What book do you want me to translate?
I'm in a rush to go home. It's already late.
There are some Westerners' alphabet letters.
I can't read it.
I'd like for thou to translate it for me.
Kneel on one knee.
This magnolia garland…
I grew the plant and made the garland myself.
I remember in our past life, thou liked to tuck one behind thy hair.
Will thou marry me?
What is the reason that you want to marry me?
If your answer is because we're a destined couple,
you don't need to answer me.
That's not the only reason.
I just think that…
I…
I've been getting hurt lately.
It might be because we haven't been married as promised.
I'm very worried that one day the person who gets hurt is thee.
So if we weren't betrothed because our lives depend on it,
if you had never dreamed of me,
if we were someone who had just met,
would you still want to marry me?
Will thou stop coming up with things that aren't real?
Will you stop calling me thou?
I feel like you're talking to someone else, not me.
What are you worried about, Chief?
The Prince will surely be satisfied
with the miniature ship you made.
I thought you wouldn't be able to complete it.
But the miniature ship is able to work perfectly.
Chief, you truly do have the skills it takes.
I'm very impressed.
This being the situation,
shall I continue on with purchasing the ship, sir?
If our Siamese engineers are so skilled, they can make their own ship themselves.
I don't think there is any reason to waste money on buying a ship
from the British at all.
Are you saying
that we won't buy the ship from Mr. Hunter, sir?
What if he reports this to the British Army?
Don't you use this to threaten me.
I'm not afraid of those Westerners.
THE BRITISH FACTORY ROYAL TREASURY PIER
THE PRINCE'S PALACE THE PRINCE'S THEATER
You're here, Pi?
Come in. I'm almost done reading my book.
Is Father Pallegoix here or not?
He's not in.
What business do you have?
There's something suspicious about the steamboat.
I want to know if Lady Karaket recorded this in her journal.
Bhop, I think we should ask for Pallegoix's permission first.
He wouldn't allow it anyway.
I just want to take a quick look.
This is strange.
Pallegoix shouldn't have taken the chest elsewhere.
Thou.
Bhop!
You can't be trusted.
Wait.
Hold on. Please listen to me first.
I just want to know something from the Lady's journal.
Once Mr. Hunter found out that Siam wouldn't buy the ship,
he was furious.
Just you wait!
If they don't buy my ship,
I'll sell it to their enemy.
Siam will lose to Cochinchina because of this ship!
So, I'd like to know…
what will happen with the steamboat.
Well then, please let me take a look.
I think we should let it take its own course,
just like Pallegoix said.
But…
How about this?
Let's take a vote.
Volt?
Vote.
How?
Do what I say.
Who thinks we should read the journal?
Raise your hand.
Next, who thinks we shouldn't read it?
Raise your hand.
All right. Open it.
Hey!
But I don't agree.
The principle of voting is you have to respect the majority's decision.
And here, Chief and I, we have two votes.
You have only one.
Oh, this is how it works.
But if I still don't want you to read it, what do I need to do?
You just accept it.
I found Hunter.
"Hunter brought the Express steamboat to sell to Siam,
but Siam turned down the purchase."
"He then threatened to sell the ship to Cochinchina,
which is Vietnam in the future."
"After that, Hunter was exiled from the country."
Just a threat resulted in exile?
What else did the Lady say?
She…
What did you say?
The thunder was so loud I couldn't hear you.
I said that was all the Lady wrote about Hunter.
And did she write about the Prince?
The Prince?
Yesterday
I saw some smuggling going on with crates being brought from Hunter's steamboat
and stored in the Prince's theater.
Even though these two hate each other.
Do you know anything about this?
I have no idea.
I have a way to get into the theater.
Mathus.
Could you look through Mr. Hunter's office?
There might be evidence that you could bring to me.
Do not worry.
Tomorrow when the sun is swallowed,
we'll send off Mathus together.
When will the person from the theater bring the keys?
No one is coming.
We'll break in.
I'll take a look to see if anyone is guarding that area.
Whoa.
It's pitch dark.
That's your windpipe.
Bhop.
Phu, what are you doing, sir?
I brought a performer for the master to consider.
He's famous in Klang city.
The master asked him to try on the outfit.
But the room is locked.
I'm going to go get the key to unlock it.
Hold on.
Today is my shift to guard the store room.
Are you really a famous performer?
Show me.
Your moves are awkward.
How can the people of Klang like you?
What is that?
I don't think you're a performer.
Who is he, sir?
Phu, why did you hit me?
So this is it.
The magical windpipe that makes people fall asleep.
Khun Yutthamat.
That's my butler.
He gave me a ride here.
He's trustworthy.
I already told you.
Do not bring anyone with you.
What's in the chest?
Let's open it.
It's just curtains for the backdrop.
I knew it. It's just all in your head.
With all these muskets,
the Prince and Hunter are definitely planning a coup.
You.
What did you hear?
I didn't really hear anything.
Sir.
Why did you follow me then?
Who are you really? Tell me.
LUANG AWUTWISET
This pistol has been kept over a century as a family heirloom.
I'm your descendant.
I came from the future.
I mean, I came from the time ahead.
What are you talking about?
Sir.
Don't follow the Prince's plan.
Otherwise, you'll be exiled from Siam.
The Prince and I planned for Siam to turn down the deal in the first place.
I agreed to make the deal because the Prince will make me
the Minister of the Royal Treasury, overseeing all the trades in Siam.
Sir!
Sir!
Don’t do this, sir!
Tomorrow, when I'm done with my business,
I will send you off to be a slave in Singapore.
Sir!
I'm begging you.
I have to return home tomorrow!
Sir!
Go to bed first, miss.
The Chief will come soon.
I can't fall asleep.
Is this an ominous sign?
What sign, miss?
I couldn't hear you.
What's with the chair?
Are you tidying up the room?
Chief.
Let go.
I didn't see you coming.
Just what I thought. Something bad happened.
Mr. Hunter locked me up
because I knew his secret.
What evidence did you find?
In the Lady Karaket's journal,
it said the reason Mr. Hunter was exiled
was because he put cannons aboard the steamboat
and fired them at the city wall.
And now Mr. Hunter…
He's heading to the steamboat.
Didn't Chief come with you?
Mr. Hunter is preparing a coup.
They're planning to hand Siam to the British
according to the order from the Prince.
You don't know this because I tore the page out from the journal.
What is the reason for hiding this from me?
I was afraid that if you knew,
you would arrest Mr. Hunter
even though he hasn't done anything yet.
You really are selfish.
You're just worried for your ancestor.
Have you forgotten about the people of this country?
No wonder why the Prince
took the Minister of the Royal Treasury and my father
away for urgent work at Pak Nam.
I'll go home to send an express horse
to tell Father to return quickly.
Gaysorn.
This is for you.
Miss.
TO MATHUS, WE WISH FOR YOUR HAPPINESS
IN 177 YEARS INTO THE FUTURE.
WE WILL MISS YOU.
Pi, give this letter to the express horse and send it to Father.
Where are you going, miss?
Are you going after the Chief?
Don't worry about me.
Pi, go right now.
Miss, please don't go.
It's dangerous.
Miss, please don't go.
-Pi! -Miss!
Quickly go now.
Your lifeline might be reaching its end.
No matter what, I can't let you go.
No!
-Let go of me! -Please don't go, miss!
Pi!
Pi!
Pi, I'm begging you.
Send this letter to Father right now.
Miss.
Stop, Mr. Hunter.
The Police Colonel is bringing the soldiers and police here.
Stop what you're doing.
Miss.
What is the Police Colonel going to arrest me for?
It just happens that today is Captain Brown's birthday.
He's the captain of this steamboat.
According to our traditions,
we have to take the ship out to fire a celebratory salute.
I know you're planning to do some bad things.
-How did you get here? -Who is there?
Help!
Help me.
Help me.
Help!
Help me.
Sir, what are you doing?
Aren't we just going to fire up into the sky?
Aiming in that direction is firing at the city wall.
That's right.
Won't we all lose our heads?
Not all of us.
Just you.
And your cronies.
You can sweet talk the Prince into buying…
I believe that if we purchase this steamboat,
Siam will be a feared armed force in the region.
…or not buying this steamboat.
The decision is yours to make.
The ship is not in an ideal state.
Siam has the capability to build our own ship.
I don't think that we need to buy the ship from those Westerners.
"Pao Hoo."
Pao Hoo! Pao Hoo.
Bhop.
Are you all right?
A moment ago, was I
cool?
Freakin' cool, Mr. Sailor!
But right now, please free me.
Thou and Mathus quickly find a hiding place.
I’ll try to stall them
while we're waiting for the troops to come.
In the time ahead,
will Siam be a colony under the British?
Never.
If so…
I will make your history
the same.
You really are a good ancestor.
Bhop.
What about Mr. Hunter?
Bhop, watch out!
Hey!
Mathus.
Run!
Wait.
Go after them!
You go in first. I'll stall them.
Don't worry.
Oops.
Damn, is that The Hulk?
SLOW
Crocodile is on the left, steer the ship to the right.
The city wall is on the right, turn the wheel to the left!
It's nothing.
I can take it.
The masseuse I know has heavier elbows than you!
Wait. Chill, man.
Barn owl!
Help me.
Shoot, damn it!
Aim towards the city wall. Don't miss it again.
Hold on. Take it easy.
Whoa! What the hell is wrong with you guys?
My ears are about to burst!
Are you a British spy?
It takes
a lot of effort and time
to load the bullets.
Don't you get that?
What kind of ominous day is this?
Don't shoot!
It might take you forward in time.
I forgot the bullet.
Wherever this pistol will take thee,
I'm going with thee too.
Bhop!
Gaysorn!
Your lady is awake.
Bring some water for her to get freshen up right now.
Yes, sir. Khun Sriwisarnwaja.
How art thou, my dear Karaket?
Thou were dead asleep.
THIS JOURNAL IS MADE AS A RECORD OF EVENTS IN AYUTTHAYA ERA.
MY NAME IS KETSURANG. I'M A FOURTH-YEAR ARCHEOLOGY STUDENT.
Thou have filled up all the pages in thy journal, correct?
It's all right.
I'll have someone make new ones for thee, just like this one.
Found them! Found them!
Gaysorn.
Do you hear me?
Gaysorn!
She's not breathing.
We have to give her CPR.
Put your right hand over your left.
Press into the middle of her chest real hard.
Harder!
Gaysorn.
Gaysorn.
Next.
Pinch her nose and blow air into her mouth twice.
Blow…
Blow air into her mouth by using my mouth?
I can't.
There's no time.
I'll do it then.
…if you had never dreamed of me,
if we were someone who had just met,
would you still want to marry me?
Gaysorn.
Gaysorn.
Gaysorn.
Gaysorn.
Gaysorn.
Bhop.
What a waste…
of the respect
and trust I had in you.
Why did you use my name
to start a coup?
All that I did was for you, sir.
Let's go.
In the name of Siam, we need to arrest you.
Please do not resist.
That pistol probably took you here for this reason.
But
I'm sorry that I lost your pistol.
God or other sacred beings
must have wanted the pistol here.
But the pistol couldn't come on its own.
So I had to come with it too.
You really are a good descendant.
The news from abroad states that when Mr. Hunter was exiled,
he sold the steamboat to Cochinchina
for 67,000 dollars.
I know
that you all secretly read the journal.
But
I also know the journal used to belong to you.
You keep it.
I probably won't read Lady Karaket's journal anymore.
I'm determined to record
the events of the world I am living in now.
In my own way.
I will record the events of Siam in my own way as well.
This is how history is.
The same event,
different people recording, different perspectives.
LUANG AWUTWISET
Mathus.
Mathus.
Mathus!
Pei.
Did Chief Sombatbordi come to our house?
Yes, but I chased him away.
He came to confess to me that he has taken liberties with you.
He would like to take responsibility and marry you.
What?
Oh, no.
Hi there!
Hey!
Miss.
May I hitch a ride on your boat?
Can you please row faster? I'm in a rush.
Miss.
Please let me.
Bhop!
Bhop.
Bhop!
Bhop!
Bhop!
Bhop!
Bhop!
Bhop!
Don't you
have any flowers for me today?
A kafferboom.
I collected from thy house.
Did you know?
People in the old days said
whoever smells the kafferboom will remember their past life.
I know.
Which is why I've never given thee one.
That day I drowned, I dreamed and saw
that our past lives together was real.
I was Lady Karaket.
You were Khun Sriwisarnwaja.
All right.
Us two will leave now.
Do you believe what I said?
Whether I believe it or not, it's not important anymore.
Because ever since I've met thee,
I've never dreamed of Lady Karaket again.
Because the person I think of is thee.
The person who I love in this life.
The photograph will be evidence we can leave for our children
that the times we were together are real.
But the locals are saying
this box pulls souls into it.
How about I draw ten pictures of thee to make up for it?
You don't have to be afraid.
If this box pulls souls into it…
I will go with you.
Stand still.
One, two, three.
My dej-ti-ny.
Right here, uncle.
I remember.
In my last life, I buried it with my own hands.
An angel told me in my dream.
I wasn't worthy of protecting it.
It should be kept underneath Ayutthaya soil.
For the future.

PUTTARN_PT
I'm good.
Follow me.
-Welcome. -Thanks.
Are you okay?
-I'm fine. You? -I'm fine.
What is this? What happened to you?
It's nothing. I fell.
What do you mean, you fell?
I just fell.
He says hi.
STREET FLOW 2
2 YEARS LATER
Come on!
Hurry up. I've been asking you to do this for five minutes.
Hey, in the back!
Come in.
He's always late!
-8:40 a.m.? -Public transit, miss.
Do you have your own public transit? You're the only one who is late.
-Do you know what "public" means? -What "public" means?
Transit for a guy in misery?
-He's right. -No.
It means for everyone. Shared among many.
Get your things out.
"The street about me roared with a deafening sound."
So put in your AirPods.
-"And there, in the middle of the crowd…" -A chick.
A chick. Tall, slender, and sadly beautiful.
Sadly hot.
Yeah!
Hey, okay! Enough.
He was so thirsty.
Baudelaire is a Symbolist poet.
Miss, we don't care about Baudelaire.
Can't you tell us about stuff from our century?
-Like who? -I don't know, Niro?
-Ninho, miss! -Or Kalash Criminel!
We can think about it, but today, we're reading To a Passerby by Baudelaire.
The poem speaks of love.
That's a universal subject. Has it never happened to you?
You're waiting for the RER. You see someone, and you think,
"Maybe we could have had an amazing love story."
Not to me. If I see a chick I like, I go get her Snap.
You get it.
You're a player, man.
Shut up. Whose Snap are you gonna get with that face?
He's jealous because he's ugly.
He's not going to get one Snap. It's sad.
Fuck you. You think I'm your buddy?
-Watch your language, Anis. -My language?
He's been disrupting the class. Now it's my fault?
Miss, let it go. That's how Aviateurs guys are.
They talk a lot, but when it goes down, they run.
Run? Run from what?
-I said, you run! -Boys, stop!
You run away!
Fuck you! You're putting on a show!
-Let's go outside! -Let's go outside!
-Noumouké! -Let him. He's putting on a show.
You show up late, then you start acting out?
Keep your head down. Calm down, okay? Both of you go to the principal's office.
-Mr. Delors? -Yes?
Mr. Mercier is ready to see you. Would you please follow me?
Yes.
-Mr. Mercier? -Yes.
Mr. Delors is here.
Hello.
Mr. Mercier, this is Mr. Traoré. He's my sales manager.
Hello, Mr. Traoré. Hello.
Look, Mr. Delors. Your company has experience in the building trades.
We've looked at your balance sheet, which was quite impressive for 2019.
It's two years since we opened the insulation division.
An initiative of our sales manager, Mr. Traoré.
He's the boss. His wish is my command.
He's the boss. His wish is my command. He's not full of himself either?
No.
Let's get straight to the point.
How many gigs do you produce a month? What? 150? 200?
200 gigs.
-We'll need one tera by next month. -That's 1,000 gigs.
We can do it.
The ones before you said they could do it.
But they didn't convince you. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here.
But they didn't convince you. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here. Do you know what that means? You'll need five times more customers.
Do you know what that means? You'll need five times more customers.
Five times more sales representatives, labor, trucks, materials,
and most of all, five times more investment.
And you would need five companies the size of Mr. Delors'.
That means five times more intermediaries, risk,
and perhaps, in the end, five times more problems.
I'm sure you have enough problems.
What is this?
-We noticed that you're a soccer fan. -Well, yes.
This comes with no obligation.
No? Presidential suite?
You should have started with that.
-It's in the bag. -Don't get carried away. It's not done.
If it does work out, I still need to find trucks, salesmen,
and even a call center.
Anyway, if it works out,
you're going to double your revenue.
And?
I'd like a little raise.
Remember when you came from Belgium without a penny to your name?
What did you say?
Find me something. Give me work.
Do you remember?
Now you get 3,000 euros a month just to put your name on some papers,
and you want a raise?
Get out of the car.
-Demba, come on. -Get out of the car!
-It's far. -I said, get out of the car!
Hurry up, for fuck's sake!
Okay.
You'll end up with nothing!
-You're gonna leave me here? -Shut up.
Careful, Rime!
Come on, let's go!
Yes, come in.
Yes, I'll be late.
I can't be in two places at once.
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.
Soulaymaan, what can I do for you?
I'm tired of preparing drafts.
It's part of the job.
I know, but I didn't become an attorney to do that.
I want to plead, to work with clients. A real attorney.
You're an associate in this firm.
Nothing is stopping you from pleading for your own clients in court.
Come on.
You're drowning us in work.
Even if I took my own clients,
I'd never find the time to attend to them.
You are compensated in return.
You're welcome to put an end to this collaboration.
Young lawyers are lining up at the door.
Soulaymaan.
Go visit our clients in the Fleury Prison.
You want to work with clients, right?
That's not what I had in mind.
Well, it's that or drafts.
Of course, be reassuring. Tell them that the case is moving forward. That you're going to talk to the judge.
Tell them that the case is moving forward. That you're going to talk to the judge.
Yes? I was going to call you back.
-Are you good? All right? -Yeah, you? Chilling.
So?
Demba, hook me up with your guy at the Port of Le Havre.
I'm going to get my own stuff.
I'm not involved anymore. I don't want to be seen with them.
If you stop taking Abdel's stuff, you'll be in trouble.
-I don't want my name to come up. -Who is Abdel? I do what I want.
There's no godfather or whatever. This isn't Italy.
You know how much he makes with Sahli's turf? He supplies all of Val-de-Marne, and I can't get my own stuff?
He supplies all of Val-de-Marne, and I can't get my own stuff? Come on, brother.
I'm gonna tell you something.
It was Abdel who told me this.
"On the streets, there are two kinds of people who don't last."
"An old-timer underestimating a young guy's greed."
"A young guy underestimating an old-timer's experience."
You understand?
Okay, Demba. See you later.
What did he say?
He's underestimating my greed.
Fuck him and Abdel.
-No. Don't say that, bruh. -What? Are you with them or with me?
It's not about that.
When I had trouble with guys from Auber, Demba stuck his neck out for me.
You can't forget that.
I got it. He's your big brother. Fine.
Your plate.
-I'm good, Mom. -No, eat a bit more.
A little bit, then.
That's a little bit?
Eat.
That's not a little bit.
INCOMING CALL SOFIA
Remember Hawa?
Binta's daughter.
She's getting married soon.
Binta's daughter is getting married?
How old is she? She's 22.
I was married at 18. Right.
Ma, do you have someone for Soulaymaan? A chick without teeth.
Stop it.
If Soulaymaan was ready, I'd get him a woman tomorrow.
A lot of moms have asked me.
-A lot of moms? -A lot.
Okay.
He's not into that. He's going to bring a very white, blue-eyed blonde.
That's what he's into.
There's the daughter of the cousin--
The cousin of your aunt,
the one who lives close to the neighbor…
Her daughter-in-law who…
It's fine. Thank you.
Are you making fun of your poor mother?
No, Mom. I have a career to build.
It's not everything to have a family. You have to be able to afford it.
Soulaymaan, your father wasn't a lawyer.
You've always had a roof over your head, food and drink, and clothes.
Right?
INCOMING CALL SOFIA Turn that off, Noumouké.
How is school?
-Is that it? -I'm getting good grades.
-It's fine. -I hope so, for your sake.
It's time for prayer.
-Enjoy your meal. -Thank you.
Where are you going?
Six months wasn't enough?
You want to go back to prison?
You're not leaving here.
Fuck him up!
What's up? What are you talking about?
I didn't tell Demba about you being expelled.
But that's it. I'm not covering for you anymore.
-Do you have a short memory? -I never asked you for anything.
-I never asked you to take the blame. -I know.
You didn't have to ask.
Close the door.
Big brother.
Abdou!
Aïssa! Come.
Why did you do that?
Fuck!
Stop! Hey, stop!
Stop! Give me your hands!
You're hurting me! Let go of me!
I can hold it.
-Give it. I'll-- -Stop it!
Sofia, Demba was there. He stopped me. I couldn't leave.
You think I was scared?
You think I was scared or what?
You'll see what I'm going to do to them.
Hang on. It's that son of a bitch, Anis.
You bitches!
We have to wait. They'll be expecting us.
You'll see.
Trust me.
Let me hold it for you.
The projects
They had the nerve to raid the projects
I'll show them that I can be bad too
And I won't need my big brother for that
Give me a piece And I'll even leave them on the ground
On the ground
When?
Tomorrow morning.
-How much? -Ten kilos of hash and two kilos of coke.
Where is the pickup?
The usual.
You're sure he'll be there?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Farid.
If you're jerking me around…
Look at me.
I won't let it go.
-You got me? -I got you.
Show your hands!
Mr. Abdel.
What's going on? You're surprised?
All this for me?
That's right. All this for you.
An apple a day
keeps the doctor away.
You're cocky, eh?
On my mother's life, I'll get you. Don't worry. You piece of shit.
We're missing some completion notices.
I did it. It's in order.
Rime has been asking for them for a week.
You see her?
She acts on my behalf.
-Okay, boss. -Okay.
Your cousin is here.
Let him in. Never make Doums wait.
Bring me the notices, guys.
I'm getting the truck. I'll bring them.
"I'm getting the truck. I'll bring them."
-He heard you, you crazy fool. -What is he gonna do?
You work with undocumented workers.
-They're absolute machines. -I'm gonna rat you out to the URSSAF.
Hire some guys from the projects.
All they do is complain and ask for raises.
That's called integration.
That's assimilation, not integration.
You can't tell guys from the projects a thing.
You're making a killing.
Appearances can be deceiving.
I've had one struggle after another.
That said, sitting in an office all day, checking on employees,
that's not for me.
You spend hours overseeing a trap house.
I saw that coming.
I miss Samir, that bastard.
Demba!
Watch out!
Are you really done?
Do you know what insanity is?
Insanity is always doing the same thing and expecting different results.
Stop philosophizing.
Come on. Come here.
Hello.
-Hello. -How are you?
Are you kidding me?
I've been struggling for an hour.
You're looking for trouble. Turn that off.
Get up.
Get up.
I had to fight the principal to prevent you from being expelled.
Even for you to be allowed on school grounds.
Come sit down.
You're gonna read this.
Noumouké, you're gonna read this book
and write me an essay about how it made you feel.
I don't want an analysis. I want to know what you felt.
Miss, the truth is, that doesn't interest me much.
Oh yeah? And how do you know that?
I know myself well.
The hardest part is starting.
I promise you that you'll lose track of time.
What's this thing about?
It's the story of Martin Eden.
No, really? Doesn't it say Martin Eden?
It's about a guy who doesn't like to read and spends his time fighting.
Remind you of someone?
And you?
One day, Martin Eden defends someone in a fight. A very rich man.
The rich man has a sister.
Martin Eden falls in love with her.
But the sister is upper class. She's educated, rich.
So Martin Eden tells himself he'll educate himself.
He'll read every book.
And once he's like her,
she'll fall in love with him.
You think I'm Martin Eden?
You think I'm going to read to seduce a chick?
You've never fought to impress a girl?
So, does he get with her?
-What? -Stop playing.
In the end, does he get with the chick?
-Where are you headed? -Nanterre.
That's far.
-Good evening. -Good evening.
-Good evening, Djenaba. -Good evening.
And you? Choisy?
-No, Vitry. -She has to pick up her son.
You have a son.
Yes. Idrissa. He's ten years old.
You're going from here to Vitry, Vitry to Choisy, on public transit?
That's how it is raising a child on your own.
I can take you partway.
You surprised me with that meeting with Arcus.
I've been trying to get one for ages.
Where were you working before this?
I haven't worked for two years.
Wow. Why is that?
I started wearing the veil two years ago.
And you, sir? What did you do before insulation?
Me?
Always the construction industry.
You don't have to call me "sir." I'm not 50 years old.
I can't do it.
Why not?
I don't know.
It's not like you're that young.
I'm joking.
Stop acting crazy.
-You played me real good! -Calm down! What's going on?
Why would I do that? I want Abdel to fall too.
-How would he have known? -No clue. Your colleagues?
Stop your bullshit. You think everybody is into double-crossing like you?
I warned you, Farid.
I'm not letting you out of my sight. I'm going to be a leech.
I'm going to eat Farid, sleep Farid,
and when I fuck, I'll fuck Farid.
It won't stop until you go down. Trust me.
Shut up! Don't touch me!
Stop getting angry for nothing.
This is my turf, I swear!
If I were you, I'd keep a low profile.
You know why? Because Abdel probably knows it came from you.
What did you tell him? Huh?
You fucking bitch! What did you tell him? Huh?
The chambermaids at the Hotel Ibis in Batignolles are on strike.
They're protesting their work conditions and low wages.
Among their demands, they mention the unequal treatment
of subcontractors and salaried employees.
Turn it down.
They've been showing the same thing.
"They've been showing the same thing…"
You've been watching the same shit too.
I'm going to bed. There's nothing to do here.
He's offended.
Okay, Mr. Lawyer.
You're really going to sleep?
Yeah, I am. I'm dead. Miss Saadi made me read all day.
What book?
Martin Eden by Jack London.
"On the library shelves, I saw a world emerge on the horizon."
-You read it? -Yeah, I read it.
You know it by heart?
No, I don't know it by heart. I only know a few quotes.
It always sounds good to add one or two quotations to a defense speech.
All that to seem French.
What do you mean, "to seem French"?
I don't want to be uncultured.
"He who speaks the language of a people avoids its evil."
Hello. Hello.
Hello.
He's asking us to provide one tera by next month.
We don't have enough staff… DINNER?
I DON'T KNOW…
You should ask the big boss. Demba?
Demba?
We're going to grow the team.
We'll have to train the new people.
We'll use a second call center in Morocco.
THAT'S NOT A NO… We're not sending you out to battle without any weapons.
-How are you, Ma? -I'm good, Soulaymaan.
Can I try?
Mama. Come on. Just a little bit.
It's for my charity.
You know I love your bissap.
If you like the bissap, pay for it.
How is it going?
I'm at the preface. It's moving along.
Do you like it?
If you're trying to tell me I need to become a nerd to make it,
I think I get it.
Right, can I go?
Bye, miss.
-You're not taking the book? -No.
I'm not bringing it home unless I have to.
Traoré.
-That's how you greet me? -I don't have friends in the police.
I know. Mr. Demba Traoré isn't a snitch. I hear you're in the insulation business?
-You're going to arrest me for that? -No. What I'm interested in is narcotics.
I'm not involved.
What are you trying to do here? Tell me.
You're trying to start a new life? It's the new Demba, is that it?
Do you remember June 28, 2018?
On the day they tried to kill you,
guess whose phone pinged in the same area Sahli was in?
You don't like guessing games?
You're trying to tell me Abdou was involved? I knew that.
No.
Abdou and Sahli were tight.
But between you and me, you think they did that on their own?
Those two? Demba, who ended Sahli?
Who took over Sahli's trap house when he got killed?
Who's dealing to Farid now that you're out of the game?
Here.
I don't want it.
They're photos from a surveillance camera.
They were together on the same day.
You want to use me to get rid of your enemies?
No. You're not a murderer, Demba.
You're in the insulation business, right?
It wasn't easy to get these photos. Take the time to look at them.
I can't believe it!
-He got Assia's Snap! -Stop it.
You got Assia's Snap! That's nasty!
Nasty.
Aren't they the guys from Aviateurs?
Hey! The guys from Aviateurs are at the bus stop.
-Who? -The guys from Aviateurs.
Take this.
Let's go, guys. Let's go. Let's get off.
Are you shaking?
What's up?
Hey, come here!
Hey, he's going down! Down!
Stop running! I won't hurt you!
You'll see, you son of a bitch! What's up, you son of a bitch?
Let go of me.
What's up, you son of a bitch?
Remember me, you son of a bitch?
Look at me, you son of a bitch! Remember me?
Film it! That's how it is in Bois-l'Abbé.
We kick your asses!
You son of a bitch.
You bitches.
-Let's go. -You little shit.
This place is wonderful.
Didn't I tell you you'd enjoy it?
-You can be sure I'll come back. -No "sir"?
It's the first time.
Thank you.
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.
Since you know religion well…
Hold on. It's not because I wear the veil that I know religion well.
Okay, don't be so humble. You know the basics.
Yes. The very basics.
You know, in religion,
from what I know,
all sins can be repented.
Yes.
Even when you kill someone?
Why are you asking me this?
Don't freak out. It's not for me. It's…
Someone asked me, and so, you know, I'm asking you because you'll know.
I don't want to tell him nonsense.
In religion, all sins can be repented as long as you're alive.
But the sin of murder is one of the biggest sins.
You should know that.
Yeah, I know that. I told you that it wasn't for me.
Can I take these?
-Yes. -Sure.
Soulaymaan, you're going to plead in court.
A case was brought up for immediate arraignment.
Neither Perrier nor I can go.
My secretary has emailed you.
It's time.
Hello.
Mr. Traoré.
You're the attorney?
Who else could it be?
You're young.
Mr. Millet, I'm going to get you released.
How? I confessed to everything while I was in custody.
It'd take too much time to explain.
The judge will try his best to save the case.
He's going to ask you questions to get you to repeat your confession,
which he could then use against you.
All I'm asking is
that you stay quiet.
Hello, sir. Mr. Traoré. I'm representing Mr. Millet.
Sir, the floor is yours.
Sir, I'll be brief.
Police officers arrested Mr. Millet at 10:58 a.m. on October 20th
and placed him in custody for violence with intent.
While he was in custody,
the detectives interrogated Mr. Millet about a small amount of cannabis
which they pretended he was carrying.
"Pretended"?
However,
Mr. Millet wasn't placed in custody for drug possession.
He was there for violence with intent, damage and breach of property.
The prosecutor will be aware that, according to French law,
a person in custody cannot be interrogated about an offense
other than the one they have been accused of.
And that's not all. According to Article 706-30-1 of the criminal code,
when it comes to drug possession, the weighing must be open.
The person in custody must attend the weighing of the products,
which wasn't the case.
For all these reasons, I'm asking for the cancellation of the proceedings.
Very well.
Sir.
We have Mr. Millet's confession in which he admitted
to punching Mrs. Marty in the face several times.
He can't deny it, as her jaw was broken
because, and let me quote him,
"The bitch didn't want to open the door."
That's all. I'll let you appreciate his artful wording.
Are these your words, Mr. Millet?
Mr. Millet, please?
I'll remain silent.
What?
Speak louder, Mr. Millet. We can't hear you.
I'll remain silent.
A bit like him, I'm full of hate
I come from the bottom, like Martin Eden
A bit like him, I--
The Frenchman is back.
No. Don't tell me you walked through the projects like that, please.
With a big blue, white, and red flag.
Okay, I was joking, man. Fuck you.
The lawyer is so rude.
Mama, you're looking at Mr. Traoré, attorney-at-law.
You're handsome, my son.
Thank you. I pleaded in court for the first time today.
I got the client released.
Wow. Tell me about it, my son.
Come on, tell us.
A man accused of breaking his wife's jaw was taken for immediate arraignment,
and I managed to…
What, Ma?
They need an attorney too. But does it have to be you?
So?
Forget about insulation.
Open a restaurant.
You'll have learned that in the slammer.
There's something I don't get.
Who took Sahli out?
It can't be Abdou. He was his friend.
These things happen.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Do you know the story about the frog and the scorpion?
A scorpion goes to a frog and asks,
"Can you carry me on your back across the river?"
The frog looks at the scorpion and says,
"No. You're going to sting me."
The scorpion looks at the frog
and says, "But if I sting you, we're both going to drown."
"I can't swim."
The frog thinks about it
and eventually agrees.
They start crossing the river.
In the middle of the river,
the scorpion stings the frog.
The scorpion says,
"I'm sorry."
"I couldn't help it."
"It's my nature."
And they both drown.
Did you know it?
Yeah.
I like hearing you tell stories.
Yeah! Hey, Noumouké!
Catch that son of a bitch!
Stop running!
-You're dead! -I'm going to fuck you up!
Stop!
Come here, you bitch!
We're going to kill that guy. Get him!
-Look! -He's there!
Go fuck your mothers!
Fuck him up!
Where's that bastard?
-Come on, go around. We'll catch him. -Over there.
-Don't do anything stupid. -No.
What are you doing here?
Get lost. Stop sucking your teeth.
I said not to give them anything.
I know, Farid. I won't.
Three, two, one.
Look at that.
It's wonderful.
You know what they say?
No.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
You're such a smooth talker.
Have you ever gone up? No, but I'd really like to.
Yeah?
And you?
Not yet.
We can't keep seeing each other like this.
"Like this"?
Like this, without purpose.
I need to know where we're headed. I can't play. I don't have the time.
You think I'm playing?
No, I didn't say that.
But I'm warning you.
And nothing is going to happen.
Meaning?
Nothing is going to happen physically.
I'm saving myself.
Fine with me.
And so?
-What do you mean, "And so?" -What do you want?
-Hello? -Hello? -Yeah. -Noumouké?
-Noumouké? -I'm joking. It's Noumouké's voice mail.
It's his voice mail.
Go ahead. You can pick up. I don't mind.
No, it's my mother.
I'll take you home. Then I'll call her back.
Here's a story.
A friend of mine was at a restaurant,
and her mother wouldn't stop calling, you know?
Instead of picking up,
she sent her a message, saying, "I'll call you later."
But later never came.
That story traumatized me.
Now, when my mother calls me, I pick up right away.
Yeah, Mom, it's me.
Demba. Help me find Noumouké. Noumouké didn't come home.
Find him for me. I don't know where he is.
Hey!
-I'm going to fuck you up! -Shut up!
Let go of me!
Gun!
Come on, get up!
Sofia! Come on, let's go!
Lamine, come here.
I said, come here.
-Where is Noumouké? -I don't know.
-Don't play with me, Lamine. -I'm not.
-Where is Noumouké? -I don't know.
-Did he get arrested? -No, he didn't.
Who fired the gun?
No one fired the gun.
"No one fired the gun"?
It was Sofia, but she fired into the air.
-Then we all ran away. -Where did she get the piece?
Where did she get it?
At Farid's trap house.
They're waiting to get paid.
Yeah, but…
Hey.
You give weapons to my brother?
I didn't.
-To his friends. It's the same thing. -I didn't, Demba.
Then they did. Aren't you the boss?
-Are you for real? -What do you mean, "Am I for real"?
-You do this in front of everybody? -What are you going to do?
Don't lie to yourself.
You're here because I left.
Get that son of a bitch!
Get him! Bring him back to me!
Bruh, are you okay?
I'm going to end him.
Pick your side, and fast.
He's going to go back to prison.
Stop scaring her.
Nobody died.
Noumouké needs to leave the gangs and weapons behind.
You need to talk to him.
Mom, when I was his age, there already was trouble with Aviateurs.
I was involved in it too.
Exactly.
That's why he's going to listen to you.
Will you?
Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry. He'll be back.
-Bye. -Bye.
-It's Lamine. -What is he saying?
Demba got him. He's looking for you.
Fuck, he's going to kill me.
I can't go home tonight.
You're staying here?
My brother leaves for work at 8:00 a.m. My mom at 9:00 a.m.
I'll wait for them to go.
I need to go home, or my mother will destroy me.
Stay with me for a bit?
I would've liked to have brothers and sisters.
Am I not your brother?
Do you miss your father?
Yeah, I miss him.
And you?
I can't miss him. I don't know him.
When he heard my mother was pregnant, he left. He didn't want me.
One day, we can try and look for him.
He doesn't want me. I'm not going to run after him.
Dad isn't here anymore Nobody knows how much pain I am in
I feel like I am in a starless night
Are these your lyrics?
Yeah.
Go on, sing it.
Dad isn't here anymore Nobody knows much pain I'm in
I feel like I am in a starless night
It's all blurry I don't know where to go
I just feel like running away
Mom doesn't smile anymore Home feels empty
No sun on the horizon
And some voids can never be filled
We can tell ourselves it will pass But Dad isn't here anymore
My Dad isn't here anymore
Nobody knows how much pain I am in
Nobody knows how much pain I am in
Since Dad is gone
Even summer feels cold
ALARM 06:45
What are you doing, Ma?
I'm looking out for the police
so that I can open the door before they break it.
They aren't going to come.
Come.
Come rest. I'm tired, Noumouké.
Police!
-What's going on? -Don't move! Show your hands!
-Your hands! -Yes! What's going on?
Come here. On your knees!
What's going on?
Sofia!
Sofia, what have you done?
What's happening?
You look beautiful.
I'm heading out.
When are you leaving?
I won't go to work until Noumouké is back.
It's going to be fine, okay? He's going to come home.
I love you.
I love you too.
Madam, put your phone away.
-This isn't a show. -Sofia!
Where are you taking her? Sofia.
-Where are you taking her? -Let go of me!
You hear what I'm saying? Put the phone away. Stop filming.
-What did she do? -Let go of me!
Mom!
Come on, move along.
Mom!
Help!
What did he do? Did he hit you?
…not far away
No time for tomorrow
And if we were far away from here
But near Panama
Far away
No time for tomorrow
And if we were far away from here
Oh baby
We promised each other to never let go That we would--
Ma?
Ma?
Ma?
Only God can create something that doesn't exist.
Human beings are not able to create.
For if human beings could create, then the blind man would make himself see.
The deaf man would make himself hear.
The quadriplegic would make himself mobile.
Not only that,
but most human beings would give themselves
and their loved ones eternal life.
So, my brother, love whoever you want.
Create attachments to whomever you want. You'll be separated from them.
Salam.
Death is like a doorway that each of us will cross.
My condolences.
Death is a journey.
What does anyone with the gift of reason do before a journey?
How are you feeling?
I used to think I was alone. Now I truly know what it is.
Listen…
I have a few things to do once I'm back.
After that,
I'd like to meet your son.
And I'd like us to do things by the book.
You know, Demba, there are two states in which one shouldn't make big decisions.
When you're really happy and when you're really sad.
I know what I'm saying.
You're going?
Yeah, I'm going.
-Let's talk later? -Okay.
Have you heard from Mercier?
Don't you want to talk about this later?
What's going on?
Listen, he's backing out. He's going with another team.
Don't look at me like that.
He's backing out?
We signed a contract.
Did you have a lawyer read that contract?
I invested time and money.
-I know. -A lot of money.
How much did they give him?
-Who? -The other team. How much to get rid of us?
Well, I don't know.
How much does he want?
He'll go with us if we give him 150,000 in cash.
What was your response?
I didn't close the door to it.
With all the dough you're going to make, what's 150,000?
My condolences, Demba.
Hey, Franck.
What made him think that you have 150,000 euros lying around like that?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Come see me at the office when I get back.
Until then, you tell him yes.
Got it.
Take care of yourself, Franck.
Yeah, for sure. You too.
Noumouké.
He says you look like your cousin, Ousmaan.
Ousmaan.
You can't deny you are a Traoré.
When family is corrupted and divided,
then the whole of society is unwell.
Come on, Noumouké. Get up. I'm coming.
I've come twice already.
Demba, I haven't showered. I'm sweaty.
Take that. Get changed.
What time is it?
-You've slept enough. -I'm tired.
Where's that well?
Thirty minutes on foot.
Thirty minutes?
Thirty minutes? More like an hour.
How do you know?
You ask too many questions.
He acted out so much that your mom sent him here.
Aren't you coming? No, I'll leave this to you.
It's deep, huh?
Okay.
Release it.
-Hi, Ousmaan. -Noumouké.
Hello.
Hens sit on their eggs…
It's the village school.
Your mother financed most of it with her charity.
She didn't have the time to finish it.
Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Fodié. -How are you?
These are the children of my sister-in-law, Khadijah.
My condolences.
How do you manage during rainy season?
It gets complicated.
We have to finish it.
It's a lot of work.
-Fodié. -Yes?
Do you think you can find the materials and workers?
With money, sure.
-Don't worry about money. -Okay.
Please share your network with me, Demba.
Put your phone away. Seriously, I really need it.
He says that he doesn't need his phone, but he wants it.
You live better here than we do.
He says that you're idealizing Africa.
It's been a long time since our societies became consumer societies too.
Why does he never speak in French?
I speak French better than you.
Hey, come!
Bags go over there.
Yes, Auntie.
-Driss? -Yeah?
Let's put it up.
-Watch your fingers, guys. -Yeah.
Thanks. Okay. We got it.
-Is that okay? -You got it?
Okay.
Come on, Demba. Yeah.
Yeah!
-Okay? -Thank you very much.
Time for a break, guys. Let's eat?
I'll finish up and join you.
You forgot this bit.
These big pants of yours.
Looks good, doesn't it?
I'm going back to France.
I'm going to stay with the kid a few more days.
I need to get inside his head.
Are you ready?
I'm warning you, we can't back out.
MINISTRY OF CULTURE HOUSE OF SLAVES
Hello.
Officially, 12 million slaves were deported to the Americas.
And some of them were detained in places similar to this.
It served as a waiting room.
Just like when you get to the hospital, there's a waiting room.
Small rowboats took them from here to the big ships,
which in turn went to America.
So, after the door, there was a bridge.
We call it the door of no return
because whoever crossed it never came back.
KHADIJAH TRAORÉ SCHOOL
LEARN, UNDERSTAND UNDERTAKE, SERVE
Do you know what Mom asked of me?
What?
For me to tell you to stop your nonsense.
-What nonsense? -Your shitty projects nonsense.
You were doing the same thing at my age.
I told her you'd say that.
Want to hear something?
With violence,
you decide when to start using it,
but you don't choose when it ends.
Sometimes I feel like Noumouké is upset with me.
I could have told the cops that he wasn't involved.
But I didn't.
He'd do it again if he had to.
What are you going to do?
I've never told anyone,
but I think I've been having panic attacks.
Yeah?
Have you seen anyone?
Seen who?
A therapist.
Me? See a therapist? Have you ever seen a Black man go to a therapist?
You're such a caricature of yourself.
It can help to talk sometimes.
Give me five.
What are you doing?
What is he doing?
-Come on. Stop. -Don't make me run.
-Don't hurt me! -Quiet!
You'll have your construction sites.
Come here! I said, come here!
So, you want to play with me? Come here!
Run, Forrest, run!
Abdou!
Stop!
Stop!
No! Demba, stop.
Calm down. It was Abdel.
Abdel and Sahli. I wasn't there.
What are you proud of?
You're proud of this?
You're fighting for that?
These buildings we grew up in.
In poverty. No elevators. Roaches.
That's what you're ready to die for?
All day long, all you say is, "No one likes us in this country."
"No one respects us."
"Fuck the state. There's no work."
"Fuck the police."
So? Of course, fuck the police.
You've got something to say?
Your eye injury,
was it the cops' fault or because of your stupid raid?
How can you expect anyone to respect us? We don't even respect one another.
Why would anyone like us?
We hate one another.
And you're always like, "I love my mother."
"I'll make her a millionaire."
You know what you're going to get her?
Your moms are here. Ask them.
A casket.
Because of your issues.
First leg. Second leg.
It's like the Champions League.
And for the one lying on the ground, it's game over.
-They come here and bust our balls. -Shut up!
Noumouké, Anis. Shake hands.
Shake hands.
We can clearly see the police officer grab the phone and throw it on the ground.
What he didn't know was that another witness was filming.
I can imagine that you decided to file a complaint against the officers?
I tried to file a complaint the day after. I had to visit two police stations.
It's common for police officers to refuse a complaint in this type of case.
Police tend to protect their own.
You have a very simplistic vision of the police corps.
I don't wake up wanting to beat up Black people and Arabs.
Why is he talking?
That may be the case for you. I don't mean to essentialize.
During the yellow jacket protests,
we saw that the violence experienced by the communities in the projects
could also be used against poor, white communities.
We aren't talking about yellow jackets in a protest right now.
This is the mother of an offender resisting her daughter's arrest.
Her daughter is incarcerated.
Once again, that is not the issue at hand.
We're not discussing her daughter's trial.
We're questioning the methods employed by police officers
that hit a woman,
a mother,
sprayed her with tear gas, and left her on the ground in pain.
The issue is the violence.
I have met with these mothers in tears
who had just lost a child.
Let me tell you one thing.
These mothers aren't worried about so-called police brutality.
It's easy to denounce
supposed police brutality.
When it comes to denouncing the violence used by these offenders,
whose victims are primarily from communities in the projects,
no one says a thing.
See you later.
He's coming out.
-Have a good day. -Have a good day.
Your book pissed me off, miss.
Is that all?
This guy works hard to become someone else, and he ends up alone.
With a bit of willpower and work, we can become whatever we want.
Not always, miss.
In life, some things are beyond us.
But we can control some things.
And maybe what the author is saying is
that it's not for other people that you should try your best.
Can I read it?
Officers are subject to quotas.
Management puts pressure on them.
And, of course, they're expected to hit their targets.
So what you are saying is
that violence committed by the police
against a targeted group within the population
is a consequence of a quota system
by the Ministry of the Interior and, therefore, the state.
You've answered our question.
Not only is the state not doing a thing to prevent police brutality,
but it's actually encouraging it.
Okay, this woman is in good health.
She's alive.
This isn't the George Floyd case in the United States.
Clearly, she didn't end up like Amine Bentounsi,
who was shot in the back.
Or suffocated, like Amadou Koumé.
In France, we have our own George Floyds. It's nothing new.
I'm always amazed by the way some people
are upset by police brutality on the other side of the Atlantic
while they remain blind, deaf, and mute about the same brutality in France.
We both know that if a neighbor hadn't filmed what happened,
Mrs. Fitoussi's words wouldn't have held up against the police officers.
She would've been portrayed as a bad mother
who couldn't even raise her daughter right, isn't that so?
But let's try to see the big picture
and not just debate back and forth.
Slow down. They'll notice us.
I'd say it's up to all of us to make the world a better place.
And we shouldn't minimize the impact our actions can have on others.
Get out of the car. Get out.
A smile, a nice word,
and kindness can change someone's day.
A single day can change the course of a life.
That's why we must all challenge ourselves
and stop repeating the same mistakes.
Idrissa!
Hey, babe. I'm here. I'm downstairs.
I just got off work.
But I'm here.
You don't see me because I'm on the corner, but I'm coming.
I'm here. I have everything. Don't worry.
Yes, babe, I'm here. Of course I have the champagne.
I have the champagne. I have everything. I'm here.
I'm coming. I can't run any faster, really.
Yup. I'm here.
Yup, we're good. I'm here. I'm what?
Late? Sure.
Of course I have my costume. I stopped by the dry cleaner's.
Wait!
Entry code?
Ma'am. Of course I know the entry code.
Can't you see my arms are full? I'm meeting friends.
She couldn't care less. Happy New Year, yeah?
I hope it's your last, old hag!
I know the code!
It'll take two minutes, then you can fuck all the sluts you like.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, sure. "I didn't do anything." Pétain said the same.
Marshal Pétain, you know. The Jews. Well, that's not the point. I'm on my way.
Hello?
Son of a bitch hung up.
No, I think it's just because the doors closed, so the service…
Sorry, do you speak French?
It's no use pressing the button.
It probably short-circuited. That's why it stopped.
Are you an elevator repairman?
-No. -Great, thanks.
Shit, we're stuck.
Well, all we can do is wait.
Anybody there? We're stuck! Dammit!
Anybody there? We're stuck!
-No one there. -Must you comment on everything?
We have to wait. It'll start up again.
So you are an elevator repairman.
No, but I got trapped once before with my buddy Ben. We were in school--
Now's not the time for this story.
It's hot in here.
-We could press the alarm. -Great idea. Go ahead.
Sound familiar?
It's from "Beverly Hills Cop."
-Fuck. -It was already broken.
No, it wasn't broken. It went "woah-woah-woah."
You broke it. Step away. Move.
-It's ringing. -Yup, it's ringing.
We thank you for your call.
All our maintenance technicians are currently on call-outs.
Jesus.
We're doing our best to answer you as soon as possible.
-Voicemail. -Really? I couldn't tell.
You know, it's not easy being a repairman.
Plus, it's New Year's Eve. They must be swamped.
-Do you know how much a repairman makes? -Who cares?
That'll be why no one's answering.
Isn't it hot?
Not for you?
No, I'm fine.
It's boiling. We're suffocating.
I'm suffocating.
I'm totally suffocating. We're suffocating!
I'm having an attack.
-A nervous breakdown? -No, I'm claustrophobic.
-I doubt it. -I am.
If you were, you'd have trouble breathing and feel like the walls were closing in.
I'm struggling to breathe.
Okay.
-Listen. It'll all be fine. -Don't touch me. No.
Listen to me and look at me.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
-Breathe in. -Don't touch me. The walls are closing in.
-Breathe out. -The walls are closing in!
-They're not. -They are.
-It's in your head. -No, I'm going to die. Open up!
-Okay. You're having an attack. -Jesus. Yes.
Regrettably, there's only one solution. I'm sorry.
-Did you just slap me? -No.
That was a distraction tactic to help you--
To help you target my nuts.
You're right, I feel better.
Okay.
Mind helping me take this off?
If there's a choice, no.
Come here. Jesus…
-Hello? Anyone there? -Yes, hello? Someone there? We're stuck.
-Don't panic. -I'm trying to tell her that.
Thanks. We're stuck. Can someone get us out?
Don't worry, ma'am. We're on it. Please keep a cool head.
-I'm trying to tell her that. -All right.
What time did you get stuck?
-8:45. -8:50.
-We should be specific. -What do I write?
-Is it important? -That's up to you, ma'am.
-Fine, write 8:47. -Seems fair.
Great, that's noted. Anyone with a heart condition?
-No. -No.
Okay, anyone pregnant in the elevator?
No.
Are you sure? My buddy Ben's sister thought she wasn't--
I'm sure!
-Is that a yes or no? -It's a no, Christ!
Okay. Is there a child in the elevator?
-Depends what you mean by child. -Anyone under ten.
No!
Great. What's the cabin identification number, please?
-Up above. -B-Y-0-18.
No, it's not a zero. It's the letter 'O.'
-No, it's numbers at the end. -Are you a numberist?
That's not even a word!
-Have you located us or not? -Actually, it's not a zero. It's an 'O.'
Okay, my computer says there is no malfunction.
We've been stuck in here for an hour. Isn't that a malfunction?
It's not me. It's the computer. No need to get annoyed, okay?
Easy.
-Okay, sorry, sir. -Sorry.
Okay, I'm sending a technician.
Yes!
Tomorrow morning at 8:00.
Sorry, there's no one else. Everyone's out on calls.
-No. -Good luck and Happy New Year!
Whatever happens, don't try to open the doors.
-Thank you. Happy New Year. -No, not "Happy New Year."
I won't be stuck in this coffin all night! There's no way!
-Are they playing with us? -We thank you for your call.
All our maintenance technicians are currently on call-outs.
We're doing our best to answer you as soon as possible.
Voicemail.
I know. I'm not staying here till 8:00 a.m. No way. Help me.
-To do what? -To get out of here!
Definitely not. The guy said not to try to--
But--
Oh fuck, we fell. I'm going to die. We're going to die.
Yeah, we might die, and it'll be your fault.
He told us not to try to open the doors. What don't you get about that?
-How else will we get out of here? -I dunno! Stop shouting for a start!
-I'm not shouting! -Yes, you are!
No! Where the hell are you?
I'm over here. This way.
Why?
-Distraction tactic. -Stop it.
I feel better. Sorry. You okay?
Not great.
I can't fucking believe this.
I'm spending New Year's Eve stuck in an elevator with a total stranger.
This sucks.
Honestly, it could be worse.
I could be a psychopath or a serial killer.
Or worse.
Calimero.
-The black chick with the egg on his head? -No.
-The black chick with the egg on his head? -No. Calimero! The guy who sings,
In weightlessness
-Calogero. -No.
-It's Calimero. -Calogero.
-It's Calogero. -No.
It's Calimero.
100%.
Shall we introduce ourselves?
What the hell.
Gaël, pleasure.
Hannah.
With two H's.
At the start and end. Who cares, you won't write me letters.
Come on, it's New Year's after all. It's supposed to be fun a night.
Who said today had to be stupidly happy? It's not written anywhere.
-There's no rule book on it. -You were on your way to party.
If you must know, I was going to dump my boyfriend. -Happy now? -Really?
-Happy now? -Really?
On New Year's Eve? That's horrible! What did he do?
What's it to you? He's not your friend, is he?
You're not Parisian, asking all these questions, and in that stupid costume.
-It's true. I'm not from Paris. -Where are you from, then?
Do you really care?
I grew up not far from Cap Ferret. Know it?
Sure, everyone knows Cap Ferret. Pascal Obispo, all that.
I fell for her
My home, the Eiffel Tower
-Don't know it. -You've got to be kidding me.
But growing up by the ocean is cool.
Depends on who with.
Wow, this is gorgeous.
Yeah.
This is where I spent my whole childhood. We had a house on the peninsula.
See that little boy? That's me.
The one tied to the pole.
The other two are my cousins.
Open your mouth.
Chew.
-Chew! -And swallow.
Gross! I'll tell my da--
Dad!
Is that the time? Is the tide coming in?
-Don't! -Yeah, do it.
No! Dad!
You had it pretty rough.
No, they're teasing.
They teased me. I teased them. We teased each other. It's…
We got along great.
-Yeah, you had it rough. -Yes. Yeah, I had it… rough, yeah.
Dad!
-That's awful! Why'd they do that? -I had a stutter when I was a kid.
I had no self-confidence. Especially with two cousins who were great at everything.
That's terrible. How'd you survive?
No, honestly, it was fine.
My cousins were pretty nice to me.
-They used to piss on you. -Near me.
They used to piss near me. But I would get a bit of spray.
It wasn't mean. All cousins do that, right?
-No. -Really?
-Do you still have a stutter? -It depends.
-It comes back sometimes. -When you get pissed on?
Kidding. It's a joke.
And where are you from? Paris, I imagine?
Through and through.
Shit!
I'm so sorry. Seriously, I'm sorry.
No, it's not your fault. It's mine. I should've dodged it.
-Sorry. -My reflexes are crap.
I wasn't paying attention.
Anything there?
Get out! No one knows you here!
Your party fucking sucks, bitch! Your head's like a potato.
Ben?
Ben? Is that you?
Who's that? God?
No, it's Gaël. I'm stuck in the elevator. Can you hear me?
-Gaga? Is that you? -Do you know him?
Yeah, it's Ben, my best friend. Remember, we got stuck in an elevator in school.
I wasn't listening. Call him!
Ben, it's me, Gaël! I'm stuck in the elevator. How's it going?
-You're in there? -Yeah, here! I'm stuck. Everything okay?
I mean, Johanne's girlfriend, that bitch just kicked me out
for being supposedly too drunk. So it's not going great!
It was their shitty salmon toast's fault.
That's what made me puke.
Classy!
Who's that?
It's no one. It's Hannah, a friend who's stuck in the elevator with me.
Is she hot?
-Yes! No! -I can hear you.
I mean, yes, but that's not the issue.
Attaboy! Prune's going to whoop your ass when you show up.
Really? Is she mad?
Shit. Who's at the party?
-Now's not the time! -You're right. It's not the time.
Ben? We're stuck. In the elevator.
Like Calogero?
-Exactly. So it's not Calimero. -Nope.
Call the fire department, bro. We're stuck, you hear me?
Dude, we're all stuck! I'm stuck too.
I'm stuck in life, in work, in my romantic life.
I'm treading water. I can't get anywhere!
Do you know how many times I jacked off today, dude?
Please…
No, I don't know.
Throw out a number! Come on, try to guess!
-Go on, say a number. -Yeah, okay. Three times?
Eight times.
I disgust myself. By the end, it was just powder, man. Know what I mean?
-I know. -I need someone who really loves me.
You love me, my friend.
That counts. I'm going to pick myself up.
Here we go!
No, Ben!
Ben, don't leave! Call the fire department!
Hey! Come back! Call the fire department!
What a fucking moron.
Jesus!
-He's dead. -He's definitely very dumb.
He's alive.
Humanity is saved. Great.
-I'm taking the reins. -What are you going to do?
I'm going to cause a short circuit so we can--
Jesus! Okay, don't worry, I have first-aid certification.
One, two, three! Come on, wake up!
I get a shock, and you touch my breasts? Are you insane?
Sorry for trying to save your life.
That wasn't a good idea.
I wasn't trying to touch your breasts. It was CPR.
It was medical. It wasn't…
Yeah, fine. I get it. It's okay.
Pass me my bag.
I'm unbeatable.
Are you dumb?
Okay, I am beatable. Another round?
Of course.
Can you tell me why a girl would dump her boyfriend on New Year's Eve?
Because all men are assholes.
Not all.
Yes.
Sick! I was so into this song!
Can I tell the story or do you want to dance? Yeah, sorry.
That's Tarik. My first real love.
Well, I mean, clothing aside, you look good together.
Yeah. Only she's not me.
-Sorry, am I interrupting? -Whoa, Hannah…
-Who are you? -Shut it.
I'm his girlfriend. Fuck you. Get lost!
-A little vulgar. -Shut it.
You shut the fuck up!
I see, so kneeing people is kind of your thing.
Wait.
-What's this? Out! -It's nothing, I swear.
-You're crazy! -He's my man! Leave him!
-I was a little temperamental back then. -Fuck off!
-You're a lot better now. -Yeah.
-You're crazy! -No, not crazy.
-Don't talk to me. -Why are you touching me?
It's nothing.
-Piece of shit! -She's nuts.
Okay, you landed on an asshole. Doesn't mean you can put all guys in the same box.
Yes, I can. Come on.
-This is awesome! Is it 15-20 m2? -No.
-And is that a view of Notre Dame? -Nope.
-It must've cost you a ton to live here. -Want to make an offer?
That's Vincent.
My second real love.
He took off with all my stuff.
And my car.
Thief!
My car!
Thief!
What really pisses me off is he never got the kneeing he deserved.
So you haven't had a lot of luck with guys,
but you can't make generalizations.
Come on.
-Where are we going now? -You'll see. Come on.
Okay, so this is where you work! It looks like an event company.
It is an event company. I don't get how you can be so insightful.
I think it's just my powers of observation and… You were kidding.
See? Very perceptive.
Look.
I have the report on our last event.
It was total shit.
-Really? That bad? -Yup, that bad.
If, after a campaign, people give us the hashtag #totalshit,
then it's total shit.
No one's going to speak?
Chubs?
Bird Beak?
Retard Face?
-Diarrhea? -Tiaré. It's Tahitian.
You said you'd stop with the nicknames. They're humiliating.
I'll stop once you stop producing shit.
You have to earn your first names. Right, Chubs?
I think a nickname should be earned and should highlight a professional skill.
Not so much one's physical or… personal traits.
That took way too long. Okay, let's get to work. Move it.
Great. Except you, CB.
CB is… for Chuck the Bachelor?
Cute Butt.
What's so funny?
You're a real bitch, actually.
No, I'm a woman. People need to respect me.
Okay, sure, but as kind of a bitch.
A respectable woman.
A respectable
bitch.
Bitch.
All right, enough!
-Well, I think the jury's out on this one. -I can come back.
174 to 4, no, you can't.
Even if we were stuck in here a year, no chance.
Well, things seems good with CB.
Marc.
Gaël. I know. He's Marc.
-So, things are good with Marc? -Yeah.
We've been together two years. It's fine, but
it won't last. It never does.
Like the others, he'll screw me over. That's why I'm going first.
Wait. You're going to dump your boyfriend on New Year's Eve,
when he hasn't done anything, just in case?
Yup.
Who said he didn't do anything? You're really all the same.
If you say so.
-Peanut? -No.
Who was the girl you were talking about with your buddy earlier?
-Prune? -Yeah.
Prune's my girlfriend.
Really?
What?
Shit! Turn around!
Stop moving!
One, two, three! Come on!
One more time! One, two, three!
One more!
-Fuck! -Fuck!
Okay, that was close.
-I saw the light. Wow. -Really?
-You saved my life. -No.
-Yes, you did. -No.
According to bushido code, my life is yours now.
-There's no need. -My life is yours.
Promise me you'll be more careful.
On my honor, I will.
And to never place your finger on my mouth again.
Christ, it makes me want to puke.
-It stinks of peanuts. -Jesus.
God.
-I was so close, I'm telling you. -Yeah.
There was a moment where I thought, "It's over."
-Fuck! -Just kidding, it was a joke.
Jerk!
Are you stuck?
Someone there? Yes! Can you help us?
Are you there?
My name's Pablo.
Hey, Pablo! My name's Gaël, and my friend here is Hannah.
That's an ugly name!
Oh yeah? Like Pablo isn't a shitty name?
Stop! Shut it!
Hi, Pablo. I'm Hannah. How old are you?
Eight years old.
Such a big boy! Pablo, can you get your dad or mom to help us, please?
Dad is locked in the bathroom with Auntie Christelle.
Where's your mom?
Snoring on the couch. Sometimes she farts, like…
Turns out the little guy is pretty funny.
Listen, I'm friends with Prune
who's at the party on the 6th floor to the left, John Avidan's apartment.
My dad says I shouldn't talk to strangers.
He's absolutely right, but we're not strangers.
We're friends of John Avidan on the 6th floor.
My dad says I shouldn't talk to the guy on the 6th floor because he's an asshole.
He's right. I'm sorry. He is an asshole.
-Okay… -Too bad. We were close.
Wait, Pablo? I'm a friend of Marc's.
He doesn't live here, but he's at Justine's party.
Know who Justine is?
My dad says 6th floor to the right is all drug addicts.
I think your dad is very prejudiced.
It's not nice to judge people you don't know.
Especially for a guy screwing his sister-in-law.
-Stop! Shut it! -What?
Listen, we really need your help.
You're the only one who can get us out of here,
who can save us like a superhero, like…
Like Batman!
My dad says Batman's a fag. He has no real powers.
You take that back right now!
His parents were murdered in front of him! It caused deep emotional trauma!
I'm Bruce Wayne, and my parents are dead.
Pablo! Listen, let's forget--
Shut it!
Stop! Calm down.
Pablo! Are you there?
-Yes. -Pablo.
We'll move past those extremely homophobic remarks,
and focus on the essential, the present situation.
Fifty euros.
Excuse me?
Give me 50 euros, and I'll get my dad.
Out of the question.
Especially after what he said about Batman!
Christ…
-You don't have any money. -That's right.
My bag.
Here it comes.
There. You got it?
Got it? Can you get your parents now, please, Pablo?
No, it serves you right to be stuck in there.
When you're friends with assholes and drug addicts,
you get what you deserve.
And Batman is Superman's bitch.
-Peace, dickheads. -Wait, Pablo! Come back!
Come back, you little shit! If I find you, I'll rip your head off!
You son of a bitch! I'll beat you and your homophobic family!
You got that?!
-He's eight. -Yeah, I know.
I went too far.
Yeah, you did.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Prune.
Prune's my girlfriend.
Good evening, everyone.
How's everyone in the comedy club tonight?
Yes, I'm great too. Me too.
So my name's Gaël. I'm a comedian.
And it's not easy every day, of course.
But I'm hanging in there.
I'll always remember what my grandma said before she died.
She said, "Gaël."
Then she died.
Other than that, when I was little…
when I was little, I used to go to the beach with my cousins.
And one of them would piss on me.
He enjoyed it, I think.
And often he would call me
"toilet." That's what he called me. Because he…
because he pissed on me.
Okay, well…
Everyone bombs now and then.
But rarely as badly as that, I will say.
-You can't drink properly. -I have problems swallowing.
Prune. Nice to meet you.
Gaël.
Do you work here?
Yeah. After classes at the university.
It's a cool job. I watch funny stuff. At least most of the time.
You're right. It's hopeless. I suck.
If you give up at the first hurdle, you'll never get there.
Think I should keep at it?
No.
But if it's what you really love, yeah. You have to put everything into it.
It's important.
I'm going back to work.
Do you want to get a drink after your shift?
No.
-Friendly. So, did you get a drink or not? -I did what she told me. I wanted her.
I pulled myself together and kept at it.
-Whoa, I don't need all the details. -Yeah, sorry.
Soon after, we moved in together.
Right there.
We were so happy at first.
We had so much fun.
-Did I hurt you? -No.
-Not bad. -This is nice.
We made love constantly. Everywhere.
She went to college during the day and the comedy club at night.
I wrote plays, tried out for auditions.
-Is that straight? -Yeah! Looking good.
After graduation, she was hired at a law firm.
Meanwhile, I wasn't really getting anywhere.
-Want something to eat? -Sure.
I was getting nowhere. Absolutely nowhere.
-Come on! -Awesome!
-You could at least clean up! -We'll do it after, don't worry.
After what?
Let's go!
Seriously, what do you do all day? Just sit here, doing nothing! Come on!
That's enough now, stop!
Don't say "Let me explain."
-It was a writing meeting. -Oh yeah? What are you writing?
I lost all motivation.
I lost all confidence in myself. I thought I sucked.
Then what happened?
Comedy was a way for me to overcome my stutter,
so I didn't need to keep doing it.
So I stopped. And I got a job.
At Jurassic Pizza. As their--
Mascot?
No. Brand representative.
Their mascot.
Exactly. I'm their mascot.
Prune has always believed in me. Has always pushed me to chase my dreams.
I just couldn't do the work.
It's tough, but sometimes our dreams aren't meant to become reality.
No, I'm going to pick myself up. This year is my year.
I'll give it my all and make her proud. She deserves a good man.
Is that really what you want?
Of course it's what I want. Prune has always had confidence in me.
-She even wants a child with me. -Really?
Yeah.
You don't seem thrilled.
Of course I'm thrilled.
Why are you judging me? You judge people you don't even know.
I'm not. You just don't seem thrilled by the idea.
I am very thrilled.
That's the normal path.
You fall in love, move in together, then make babies.
Or not.
Well, that's what Prune wants. I mean, that's what we both want.
-Listen. -No, you're pissing me off.
No, listen outside.
-Take that belt off. -Wait.
Get undressed.
They're not going to do it here?
-Come on. -Clearly, they are.
Drop the panties.
Go on. No one's around. God, that's good.
Hey, we're stuck! Can you help us?
Go for it, big dog! Get that!
Keep going.
-Hey! -Again.
-God, this sucks. -That's it, man!
-Come on! -Come on!
-Have at her! -Oh shit, I'm going to come!
Keep going!
Keep going, Prune!
Prune!
-I was so glad you came tonight. -Me too.
Prune!
Jesus, Prune, are you kidding me?!
Jesus, this is a nightmare! Prune!
Fuck.
Gaël.
Don't talk. I don't want to hear you right now.
-You look like a vase. -It doesn't work. I can hear everything.
Come here.
Come on.
Know what my dad used to say when I was little?
No matter how dark the night gets, the sun will always rise.
And in the light of day, our blues all go away.
You forget about your ills and focus on what matters.
He was right.
I should have suspected.
It couldn't go on like that.
Do you know who the guy was?
No.
Just by his voice, I couldn't tell you.
One of her lawyer friends, I guess.
We redid our house near Honfleur. Come stay there this weekend.
-Yes, absolutely! What do you say, Gaël? -Yeah, totally. Sounds great.
I'll just have to check my audition schedule and all that,
but I'd love to see the region of…
-Normandy. -Normandy. I'd love that.
What about you guys?
Well, we're still looking,
but within our budget, it's either too small or there's nothing.
Yeah, that's the issue.
Plus, you would need two bedrooms.
-For the little one. -No way! I didn't know.
-No! We're not… There's no little one. -No.
Yeah, ideally we'd have two bedrooms, but we're not there.
-Not there. Until we have a little one. -Yes.
So, Gaël, what are you working on now? Are things busy?
I have an artist friend, Lorraine. Maybe you know her?
She spits fire in Avignon in the summer and told me times are tough for you now.
I've yet to spit fire in my life, but I'm doing okay. I'm fine.
-I do stand-up and lots of auditions. -That's great!
I just had a callback for a movie.
-What movie? -Really?
-Yeah. -So, who's in the cast? Any famous people?
Great cast, very eclectic.
There's Mélanie Frotillon and Pascal Pelouse in the lead roles.
-That sounds familiar. -Frotillon rings a bell.
-Great cast! Fingers crossed for you. -Thanks a lot.
-And good luck to you, Prune. -No, but there's no…
-Yes. -Great.
-Okay. -See you soon?
Yeah, probably not.
What was I supposed to say? You can't even lie.
You wouldn't have to lie if you got your ass off the couch!
You don't know what it's like getting turned down.
-I need to focus on myself right now. -Focus on yourself?
You've had two years of focusing on yourself.
When I leave in the morning, you're on the couch.
When I come home, surprise! You're on the couch.
You must be very focused.
I'm sorry. It must be different in Joinville and Honfleur.
What's the problem with that?
-Nothing, it's just-- -No, go on, say it!
Can't I dream of having a house in the country, of having kids?
So, you do want kids? You never told me that.
I do.
Yes, I want kids. I didn't want to bother you about it.
You have your career, your dreams.
But wake up, Gaël.
You were scared of sucking. Now you do. And if you want to know the truth,
you'll never make it.
She really said that?
We talked all night long,
and I decided then and there to get a job.
To give her what she wanted.
I guess she was right.
I really do suck.
I can't even make a baby.
We've been trying for a year,
and I'm shooting blanks.
You're not going to cry?
No.
I suck.
-I suck. -You don't.
I'll end up alone.
Under a bridge.
Forgotten by everyone. Pecked by pigeons.
What's this? Is it yours?
No, someone must have put it in my bag while she was screwing on the stairs!
Of course it's mine. There are only two of us in here.
You can play this with your little T. rex arms?
No.
Come on.
Play. I'd like that.
No.
Go on. I would. Please.
It's a ukulele.
It's a guitar for losers.
What? No, nothing.
We can't all have hidden talents.
I'm sure you have a special talent.
Kneeing people.
Anyway, you sing really well.
I really think so.
There are plenty of girls who'd dream of being with you.
Really?
Yeah, I think so.
Like who?
Aren't you in love with your girlfriend and having a baby?
Yes, but after hearing her screwing in the stairwell, I'm not gonna lie,
it's putting everything into perspective.
It makes me think maybe I could explore other options too.
Even if it's just a dream.
Okay, hand me my bag.
Let's see what we have. Come here, let me show you something.
So…
This is Marie. Kind of your type.
Typical Parisian, a high school friend, super hot.
-Yeah, not bad. What does she do? -She's a Krav Maga instructor.
That'll never work.
I'm a pacifist.
My qi is too weak.
Tiny little qi.
Too bad. Okay, let's keep going. There's also…
-Awesome! Is that your dog? -Yeah! He's my baby.
Awesome.
What's his name? I had one when I was little.
-His name was Barney. -Barney.
-Are you kidding? -No way!
Yeah.
As in Barney the town drunk in the Simpsons?
No. As in Matthew Barney, the American artist.
Don't know him.
-But that's still crazy! -It is wild.
-Who else? I can't go out with Barney. -Yeah. Wait.
Let me keep looking. Otherwise…
Anouk! I love Anouk. She's a bit quirky, but she's great.
What does that mean?
Are you allergic to goat's milk or Larzac?
-No, not that I know of. -Then that could work out.
Okay.
Well, that's--
-What? -That!
-No one. -I saw some breasts.
-That was no one. -Yes, there was a pair of boobs. Whose?
Mine. But who cares? I usually delete them. I forgot.
No way!
You take photos of your boobs? To send to who? To CB?
Who cares? It's my body. It belongs to me.
-Can I look again? The photo was blurry. -Forget what you saw.
Impossible.
That image is ingrained in my head forever. I have a photographic memory.
I close my eyes, I see your boobs.
-Bliss. -What are you doing?
Stop. You're grossing me out. Stop!
-Stop! -You stop!
Sorry, I have no more friends to show you.
What's your type anyway?
No.
No, thanks.
Not at all.
No, forget about it.
I'm going to open this elevator
and get Prune because she's the only girl for me.
I'm going to fight for her!
Wait, Gaël.
I summon the power of bushido!
By the thunder of Zeus!
By the meteors of Pegasus!
Great!
Fuck!
-What? -I'm stuck.
It's tight! Come on, pull!
Wait, stop moving!
-I'm stuck! -I can see that!
-I don't want to die like in Total Recall! -What?
Total Recall, but it doesn't matter! Pull!
Pull!
Jesus.
-Know what I'm thinking about? -My breasts?
Now, yes.
But two seconds ago,
you saved my life again. Yeah.
So, according to the code of "shubidu," you owe me your life twice.
Yeah.
Twice, yeah.
That was close.
Jesus, I hope I didn't ruin my costume or my boss will kill me.
-Okay, it's fine. -Were you serious?
What did I say?
When you said I'm your type.
I dunno. Yeah. Maybe.
Wait, let's imagine. Can you see you and me together?
Yeah, I bet it'd be like…
Honey, I'm home!
Finally! Coming home at this hour?
You know, the expressway was completely backed up.
The traffic wasn't flowing, but the whiskey was!
I can't hide anything from you.
You're right. I went to celebrate my promotion with colleagues
at Jimmy's.
Congratulations, honey. I'm so proud of you.
Let's celebrate tonight by engaging in coitus.
Excellent.
Till then, I prepared your favorite meal.
A McDonald's hamburger?
I can't hide a thing from you!
-But where are the kids? -They're upstairs doing their homework.
Children!
-Dad! -My loves!
How was your day today, Son Goku?
Great! I scored…
seven shots in basketball!
-Excellent! -And Princess Amidala has some big news!
I lost a tooth!
The tooth fairy better watch out because Barney is a great hunter!
That's how you see us? Like a '60s-era sitcom?
-You're a weirdo. -What?
A warm home, a caring wife, wonderful kids, I don't see the issue.
Earth to Gaël, that doesn't exist.
Are you at least cool with Son Goku and Princess Amidala?
In your dreams.
I can't talk to you when you're like this. You're hysterical.
How do you see us? Not good.
Come on, just try to imagine it.
Darling!
I'm back!
There's shit everywhere.
My sweet angel!
My life has no meaning till I see you.
You're so valiant and comforting, my dear husband.
I'm a happy woman.
Mother! May I have a younger brother for next winter?
I'm afraid not. As I didn't want you, you're the end of the line.
The sun is already low.
I think it's time I went into town to sell my cheese.
You know the rules!
You have to stay at home. Only I can go down into the village.
Too many whores and temptations!
I'm crazy. Do I have a screw loose?
I know if I go to town, I will give into temptation
because I'm weak and a coward like all men in sight of whores.
Right, let's have supper, son.
Your mother wants us out of her fantasy.
And you think I'm a weirdo?
It's better than your old sitcom. It's credible.
Credible? You just described the ideal life for a family of Mormons.
-Now I know you're not my type. -I was never an option.
-Back to being a pain. -You said I'm not your type!
You're always defensive. Constantly. You're aggressive, don't trust anyone!
And I can't stand Mormons!
And I can't stand slackers like you!
You're immature, a coward, and a cuckold. There.
-Oh really? -Yeah!
-Really? -Yeah!
-Really? -Yeah!
Okay, I'm sorry, Hannah. There. Excuse me.
We can't fight on New Year's Eve.
Come on, get up. Let's make up.
-Want to dance? -No, I'm fine, thanks.
-Come on, we've nothing better to do. -Why? Got a song to play?
Village People?
-This sucks. -This sucks?
-Yes, this sucks. -This sucks? Martin Jackson sucks?
You don't know anything! His music is in all the best '80s movies.
I kissed my girlfriend to this at the high school dance.
Hold on, did you just say, "high school dance"?
Yeah. You didn't have a dance at your high school?
We have some self-respect, so never.
You're telling me you've never slow-danced to this music?
If you want to know the truth, I've never slow-danced ever.
That's something you bumpkins do for the wine harvest.
Never.
Fine. Promise me you won't let your hands wander.
And tell your breasts to cool it.
Fine.
What are you doing?
I dunno. I…
I dunno. I thought there was a… that we maybe had a…
Can't we dance for a bit before you try to screw me?
Trying to screw you, absolutely not! It's just a kiss.
At the end of a slow dance, you kiss. It's tradition.
Yeah, but not with me! Okay, sorry. It's fine.
I wasn't going to jump on you. I don't even want to.
You're all the same.
See why only I can go to the village to sell the cheese?
It's nothing to do with cheese. It was just a kiss!
Listen, I'm sorry for the kiss, okay?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done it. It was clumsy.
Sincerely. There. I was an idiot.
Why are you always so defensive like this? What about you?
You feel sorry for yourself. You whine. You talk about plans and never do them.
I…
Keep that hot for me. I'll be back.
My dad taught me to identify the stars.
Every summer, we'd go to our vacation house.
The whole family would come. My uncles, aunts, cousins.
But every night, my dad and I would sneak into the yard.
We'd lie on our backs and stargaze.
He taught me to identify the constellations.
That was our time together.
Just him and me.
You talk about your dad a lot.
Hear that? It was a cat!
Hey, buddy! Listen, we're in a tight spot.
Yeah, we're stuck.
I have a gift. I can talk to animals.
Listen, buddy, we need your help. Can you go get your owner?
A lady? Okay. Can you go look for her?
Okay. Thanks, Dalí.
He's agreed to help us.
Hannah, are you okay?
What's wrong?
Come on.
Dad, wake up.
Dad, wake up, please!
He had a brain aneurysm while driving.
He promised never to leave me.
I've never spoken about that to anyone.
Oh shit.
It's moving.
Do you have to comment on everything?
-Hannah, listen. -No, it's fine.
Oh shit!
Here. Take it all.
That's it. Didn't forget anything.
It's you!
Dalí told me the elevator had broken down.
I called the attendant, that layabout, to secure the connection on the breaker.
Thanks, buddy.
-Happy New Year, kids! -Thank you, ma'am.
Okay, Dalí. Come on.
-Old hag! -Stop!
So, what will you do?
Stop talking.
Start doing.
You?
Trust people.
-So, should we exchange numbers? -What for?
-Your life belongs to me, don't forget. -Right.
-Two times over. -So we'll bump into each other.
Happy New Year, Gaël.
Happy New Year, Hannah.
Six, five, four, three, two, one.
Happy New Year!
Gaël?
Hannah! I broke up with Prune.
I did what I said I would. I told her we didn't want the same things.
She deserves better, a guy who shares her dreams. I don't want that.
What I want is…
You forgot your wallet.
It fell into my bag.
Well, thanks.
I broke up with Marc.
I don't want to put my trust in him.
This song is really great.
You hear it too?

IT'S NA-MI!
It aches.
Of course it does. You slept outdoors last night.
How the hell did you get home?
No idea.
I mean, I think I got on the bus.
Where did it go?
-What? Are you missing something? -My phone. Try calling me.
Okay, I'll try.
-Not in the bathroom? Of course not. -This can't be happening.
Is it outside? What a disaster!
-Take a good look. -Where did it go?

Hello. I'm the owner of this cell phone.
Hello.
Thank you so much.
I was so tired last night, I didn't realize I'd lost my phone.
-Sorry I couldn't call you earlier. -That's okay.
May I ask where you are? I can come to you.
-I'm in Seogyo-dong. -Seogyo-dong?
If it's not too much trouble, could you come to Cafe Mizi?
Okay. I'll see you in an hour.
Thank you.
INCORRECT PIN
PLEASE TRY AGAIN IN 30 SECONDS
No fingerprints and no belongings?
This bastard thought everything through carefully.
Jeez.
Isn't it like a cry for help?
I guess all that rain last week was so we'd find the body quickly.
The heavens helped us.
The rain also washed all the evidence away.
-And a wild boar found it. -For crying out loud.
Heads up.
-Did you find anything? -Not really.
This is all we found.
-What's that? -Plant food.
Plant food?
But I'm not sure if it's connected. It could've already been buried there.
WOO JUN-YEONG
A vial just like this was buried with the victim?
Jun-yeong's the killer. It's his tree.
-It has to be a coincidence. -Come on.
This vial proves he was there within the last month.
This solid evidence matches the time of death.
That idiot killed someone? How is that possible?
That's what I'm saying. He's too fainthearted to kill anyone.
So, what are you on about?
He left home seven years ago but hasn't changed his address yet.
He must hang out with bad apples.
So, you're saying Jun-yeong didn't do it, but one of his buddies did?
Exactly.
Then we should ask Jun-yeong who he went there with.
Call him. Got his number?
Jeez. You haven't talked to him for seven years.
How will you find him? Get a warrant?
Put him on the wanted list for accessory to murder?
Why bother? We have the Missing Persons Unit.
If you want to find him, get a warrant.
Yes, I want to officially report my son, Woo Jun-yeong, missing.
Dad, I came in early to help you. You're welcome.
Yeah, right!
Did you find your phone?
How did you know?
#WASTED #LOST PHONE #I SAVED HER
Jeez.
If you keep this up…
Gosh. Why bother? You never listen to me anyway.
So, when did you start using Instagram?
What? Aren't I allowed to?
Are you seeing someone?
Stop talking nonsense and drink this. You reek of alcohol.
They're already ripe? I could've helped you pick them.
You said you were busy.
When will you start selling it?
It's not for sale. No one wants it.
It's all yours.
You've reached Cafe Mizi.
Ah, yes. Just a moment.
Hey, your phone.
Take it.
-Hello. -I'm sorry.

Well…
Do you serve plumade by any chance?
It's not on the menu. How'd you know?
I had it last summer, and I really enjoyed it.
I can't have one now?
Ah, well…
I'll make one for you.
Thank you.
-Enjoy. -Oh, thank you. Just a sec.
Is it officially back on the menu?
No, I'm not sure. It's not that popular.
Could you do me a favor? You know, I can't find plumade as good as this anywhere else.
You know, I can't find plumade as good as this anywhere else.
I'll talk to my boss about it.
Yes. That would be great.

Oh, I see. That's the secret.
Thank you. Enjoy.
What took you so long?
Do you know him?
No. Why?
Well, you seemed chummy.
I thought he was a regular.
A regular?
You said no one wants plumade, but he did.
Jeez, why would you sell it? It's not for sale.
-I made it just for you. -Boss, I'm clocking out.
What about dinner?
I'm good.
Why don't you ask your wife? She must be in touch with him.
He didn't want to take care of his sick mom.

Na-mi.
G Market contacted us.
They want to feature our products for next week's main event.
Really?
Should we do this or not?
I can't decide.
Of course we should!
I thought something bad might have happened.
This is all thanks to your hard work, Na-mi.
Oh, please.
Wow, this is really great.
Congratulations, ma'am.
I know it hasn't been easy. Thank you for your excellent work.
Speaking of which,
I think now is a good time to talk about pay raise.
I'm all ears. Go ahead.
I'll double it.
Fifty million won?
I should've done it earlier. Thank you for being patient.
Why don't you go outside and make the announcement?
Wait.
This is just between us.
Just me?
You've worked with me the longest.
You deserve it. Don't worry about them.
If this project goes well, will you consider…
This is why I like you, Na-mi. You're so loyal.
You have my word. Thank you.
Eat while it's warm, and take your medicine.
By the way,
what's with this chamnamul dish?
It reminds me of Jun-yeong.
He used to love chamnamul.
Did he?
How is he doing?
-How should I know? -You're not talking to him?
What's this all about? Why are you asking about Jun-yeong?
I saw a plum tree at a crime scene yesterday.
We planted a plum tree when Jun-yeong was ten years old.
He didn't want anybody to know where.
So we went deep into the mountain.
A place you could bury a body and nobody could find it.
I saw that plum tree yesterday.
You can't possibly…
Where's Jun-yeong now?
-FIND OUT THE ADDRESS -THAT'S JUN-YEONG'S NUMBER? FOUND HIM
Wow!
For real? That's great.
We should take a picture. One, two, three.
-Jelly. -Jelly.
-Is everyone ready? -Let's get started.

He wasn't following me. I sold him a CD.
Why did you take his business card?
Why are you being so clingy today?
Think about it.
He lied about being a regular.
The CD and the baseball tickets. Do you think that's a coincidence?
If it's not, what is it?
Don't you get it? He seems like a creep. Stay away from him.
What are you saying?
What did I do with him?
I'm warning you before you do anything with him.
Do you carry the knife I gave you?
You're overprotective and obsessive. That's creepier.

DAD WE'RE TAKING THE DAY OFF
You're taking the day off today.
If you lay even one finger on her, I'll kill you.
Please.
You should've treated her better.
Don't pretend that you're a good father.
Actually,
you're a fairly decent father.
I know a father who hasn't reached out to his son since he ran away from home.
It's because of jerks like him
that I'm doing this now.
Please don't hurt Na-mi.
If she doesn't get suspicious of me like you did,
she'll be fine for now.
Don't do anything stupid.
Do you know how long it took me to get this far
after I found Na-mi's phone?
It took three days.
Three days.
With this thing, I can find out everything I need.
With this phone,
I can find out what you bought, what you want,
what you have, what you freaking ate,
who you like, and who you dislike.
As long as I have this,
I can control anyone, and I can be anyone.
And you're telling me not to do anything stupid?
The security alarm has been deactivated.
Isn't it strange?
Hackers usually go for the money.
-Why would anybody do this? -Beats me.
-They're trying to screw you over. -Exactly.
That means that someone I know did this.
Did you ever tell anyone about the Kirke account besides me?
Why would I? You're the only one who knows.
I never told anyone about it either.
You know what?
I think your boss went too far.
She can't do this to you.
I know.
But I understand.
It was a secret between the two of us.
Please. You don't have to be so understanding.
We have to catch that perp and make things right.
I can't give up now.
Anyway, whoever it was, I'll end them when we find evidence.
Who could it be?
Do you know Yeo-jeong?
She's a new recruit. How do you know her?
-We went to middle school together. -Right. What a small world.
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
We contacted Yeo-jeong first,
but she was on vacation, so we contacted you.
-Have another glass. -Thank you.
Did you find anything?
I'm looking into a few things now.
Did you notice your battery draining faster than usual?
Yes. It drained very fast.
As I suspected.
Spyware was installed on your phone.
What exactly is that?
How can I explain this so you'll understand?
This camera here works like eyes,
and this mic works like ears.
Look at the screen.
This is exactly what the hacker can see.
They can track your location,
listen to your phone calls, and read your texts.
You can easily get this spyware
for a few dollars on foreign websites.
It's a huge problem.
But I haven't installed anything recently. How did it end up on my phone?
I'm not sure.
Can you find out who installed it?
Can't you trace it?
I don't think it'll be that easy.
Why not?
I mean, the spyware on my phone is proof.
Can't we take it to the police and file a case?
Even if the spyware is on your phone,
the photos were uploaded using your phone.
You have to prove that you didn't do it.
That won't be easy.
Wow, this dude thought everything through.
So, what should we do?
I can't just sit back and do nothing.
I'll go back to the office and see what I can do.
So, this is all we can do today?
No. We're just getting started.
I reset your phone so you can continue using it.
Don't download any files or click on unknown links, okay?
How much do I owe you for today?
You can pay me all at once when everything's done.
Thank you.
-It's nothing. Don't get up. -Thank you.
I'm sorry, but can you come outside and show me the way?
-Ah, yes. -What?
You can use a map application.
Is there something else you want to say to her?
Can you…
What's with him?
-What's wrong? -What?
Where are you headed?
Do you have a roommate?
Me?
I'm asking in order to find the perp. That's all.
Do you have a roommate?
No.
What's this about?
I'll be honest.
It's about the spyware on your phone.
There's no trace of it being downloaded.
That can only mean
that someone installed it directly onto your phone.
And the sole purpose of this file
is tracking location and listening in, so it can't be controlled remotely.
I don't understand.
I'm saying that someone
grabbed your phone last night when you weren't looking.
They posted on your Instagram, sent those texts,
and turned off your alarm and ringtone.
But
you said you live alone.
If I had to guess,
someone snuck into your place,
used your phone, and fled.
What? Why do they look so chummy?
Are you sure it can't be remotely controlled?
Yes, I'm positive.
Hey.
Look at this.
They found seven bodies in the mountains.
Come on. Look!
You've been like this for an hour.
I've had a long day.
I want to be alone now.
I'll call you later. You can go now.
Do you have something to tell me?
-No. -What's with you?
It shows. What is it?
Be honest. Did something happen outside earlier?
Did you do it?
What?
I know it's ridiculous,
but the only person who had access to my phone that night was you.
You heard what he said. There was spyware on your phone.
-You think I installed it? -No, but everything points to you.
Is that what he told you earlier?
Do you believe him over me?
I can't believe that jerk.
Why is he pointing the finger at me?
Call him again.
Get him back here. If it wasn't you, just say so.
Then I'll believe you. So,
please say it wasn't you.
You…
You think I did it.
How could you, of all people, suspect me?
Just tell me it wasn't you.
Why can't you say it?
Yes.
You're right. I did it.
Yes, it was all me.
Now what? Are you going to turn me in to the police?
Go ahead.
-Do it. Do you have proof? -How could you…
Don't ever
contact me again.
Buried bodies keep turning up on a mountain in Pocheon, Gyeonggi-do.
The police just revealed that they presume there are more bodies buried
in addition to the seven that have already been found
and will continue with the search and investigation.
We wonder how many bodies…
What a joke. Where the hell is your boss?
-When did you last hear from him? -Sorry.
Call Woo Ji-man and tell him to get here ASAP.
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.
Do you think Jun-yeong did all this?
He also killed Eun Mi-gyeong?
Are you sure?
Are you sure about this?
Why didn't you tell me?
You should've told me. If it was really Jun-yeong…
You won't get away with this. They'll blame you for everything.
Delete this footage.
Let's say it was a mess when you got there,
and you just found the victim's phone.
It's all my fault that Jun-yeong ended up like this.
Pointing fingers won't help!
This is Jun-yeong's repair shop.
Let's head over there.
I don't believe you, so I'll have to see for myself.
Let's go.
HYEONGJE SHOPPING CENTER
Good. This is good.
-Do something else. -Something else?
Wait. Am I doing it right?
Very nice.
BATTERY POWER 1%
Only this many customers in two years?
He had those he picked out come here.
Eight. Eight people?
EUN MI-GYEONG
There's one more.
I know where he is.
There's another victim?
Lee Na-mi?
Hurry.
He must've left something.
Left what?
He left nothing by chance.
There's no info on her here. Jun-yeong is stalling.
Why don't we take this to the news?
I know Jun-yeong could go into hiding,
but we can save this person.
I will catch Jun-yeong.
Don't get in my way, and piss off.
What if she dies?
Then you'd be the one who killed her. Can you live with that?
-513, Hyeongje Shopping Center-- -Hold on.
We're police too.
We're from Pocheon Station.
Come on. We have something to investigate.
Are you with the Gocheok precinct?
Why did you come all the way here from Pocheon?
This is a secret investigation.
So, the person who picked up your phone left it here? And paid for the repairs?
Yes. I think that's when I got the spyware.
-Your name? -Lee Na-mi.
From the looks of things, I guess it was that dude.
BUSINESS LICENSE
"Woo Jun-yeong"?
He would have changed his last name to Oh Jun-yeong.
What? Did you say "Oh Jun-yeong"?
Wait.
If the Oh Jun-yeong I know owns this place,
the spyware could still be on this phone.
I'll call his work. Let me use your phone.
DIGITAL SHERIFF
Oh, hello. I'm calling to ask a quick question.
Do you have an employee named Oh Jun-yeong? No?
Hold on. What about Joo Yeo-jeong?
Such hard asses!
-Okay. -You must be Lee Na-mi.
What a crazy bastard.
But don't worry…
He installed spyware on my phone and completely destroyed my life.
Then he pretended to help me. What's he going to do next?
-Sorry? -He's not just a stalker, is he?
What is he charged with? What's this secret investigation about?
I know why you can't tell me.
He films weird things and posts them on the web, right?
-The truth is-- -Yes, that's exactly it.
That bastard.
Where do you live?
In the Sinchon area. -You live alone, right? -Yes.
-You live alone, right? -Yes. He asked me the same thing.
He'll show up there, for sure. Let's go.
What if he disappears? What if he never shows up again?
Then you're lucky.
Lucky?
I don't think you understand what's going on.
Do you know what I'm going through?
People think that I'm a crazy bitch.
I called my best friend a traitor, and the asshole I trusted--
I can't trust anyone anymore.
I feel like I'm being spied on 24/7.
Do you expect me to wait until you catch him?
What if you don't?
Will you protect me forever?
No, you won't.
I need everything to go back to normal.
-We have to catch him, whatever it takes. -We will, no matter what.
-Just do as we say-- -I'll invite him to my place.
I'll make him come to my place.
What? How?
By using spyware on him.
If I make him believe I don't know anything,
he'll definitely show up.
That's his objective.
If my phone's off, he'll be suspicious.
If he realizes I know, he won't show up.
If we don't catch him, he'll do this to someone else.
We have to catch him.
I'll lure him to my place.
That's a great idea.
You think you can do it?
Yes, I can.
I WAS A BIT SHAKEN EARLIER ARE YOU FREE TONIGHT?
I NEED YOU TO CHECK MY LAPTOP TOO CAN YOU COME OVER TO MY PLACE?
YES, TEXT ME THE ADDRESS
-I have a bad feeling about this. -Why? What's the problem?
She has no idea who she's dealing with.
That doesn't matter.
-She should know-- -What if he gets away?
We just have to make sure we catch him.
That way, she'll be safe.
Just in case there's a problem.
Who is he? What does he look like?
He looks neat.
But I think he'd look better if he lost the glasses and got a haircut.
-Sounds like you like him. -What? What are you talking about?
WHERE ARE YOU AT?
I'M ALMOST THERE
CALL ME WHEN YOU GET HERE
What?
That's Jun-yeong. It's him, right?
OH JUN-YEONG
Hello?
Woo Jun-yeong.
LEE NA-MI
Turn around.
Turn around.
You bastard.
Jun-yeong, don't move.
Jun-yeong?
I'm not him.
Are you cops?
Yes. We're following up on a call and thought you were a suspect.
Regardless, you shouldn't point your guns at civilians.
Were you startled? Sorry.
But you don't seem that shocked to see a gun.
Let me see your ID.
Please leave a message--
Can I see your ID before I show you mine?
Why? You don't think we're cops?
I want to know the names of the cops who threaten civilians with a gun.
You know what?
-You won't get away with it. -Hey! Stop.
Come on.
-You don't have to-- -I'm an innocent civilian…
We apologize once again.
You can go now.
Man, something about that guy seems a bit…
He looks like him from behind.
Let's get back to the car. Come on.
Excuse me.
My phone is in my room. We're safe.
What happened?
He had an emergency, so said he'd come over this weekend.
And his phone's turned off.
What's gotten into him?
-Did you make a mistake? -Me?
Maybe you guys did a bad job hiding.
I saw you walking around earlier.
The thing is, we saw a suspicious guy walk by.
I'll trace the location of this number. We can catch him if he turns it back on.
What if he knows what we're up to?
Don't worry about that.
This is the only place that bastard can go.
Right.
We can't stay here until the weekend.
We can't even contact each other. What should we do?
I have an old phone. I'll use that instead.
It might frustrate him and make him show up earlier.
That could work.
Let's do that.
Can't you talk to her nicely?
CHIEF
Hey. Why is your number in Eun Mi-gyeong's call logs?
Why was a package your wife sent found at a victim's home?
Did your son really do this?
Did you flood the scene?
-Tell me. -I was trying to catch him.
Get back here. Where are you?
-I will catch him. -You crazy--
Major Crimes is this close to putting a BOLO out on you!
I'll help you. Just come back right away!
If Major Crimes catch us here, things will go to shit.
Let's get back, clear the air, and then come back.
No one knows about Lee Na-mi but you.
Let's get back to the station, yeah?
-Did you change your phone? -Yes, I did.
Na-mi, I'm sorry to say this,
but we have to get back to the station.
I understand. He probably won't come back tonight.
Will you be okay on your own?
I'll be fine. It's not like the bastard's a murderer.
Well, that's true.
But still, a jerk like him can suddenly lose it.
Is there somewhere safe you could go? Maybe a friend's?

If he contacts you, don't meet him alone. Call us right away.
Be careful. He could install that spyware again.
Don't download anything.
Either way, I'll keep in touch.
If I don't text you, that means something's happened.
Got it?
I'll keep texting you.
Text us.
Dad, are you asleep?
DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS NA-MI, WHERE ARE YOU?

This bastard is getting bold.
I FELT UNEASY WHY DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME?
YOU WILL BE CONNECTED TO A REGULAR PHONE CALL
CONFIRM
Dad!
Hey, Lee Na-mi.
Dad!
You've been on your phone all day.
Do you want me to live in that house alone?
Dad.
Think about it.
He lied about being a regular.
The CD and the baseball tickets. Do you think that's a coincidence?
If it's not, what is it?
Don't you get it? He seems like a creep. Stay away from him.
What are you saying?
What did I do with him?
I'm warning you before you do anything with him.
Do you carry the knife I gave you?
You're overprotective and obsessive. That's creepier.
Okay?
-Drive safe. -Hey, Lee Na-mi!
I…
CHOI WON-SEOK MISSING PERSONS TEAM
We're headed back now.
What do you mean?
What?
Where's my dad?
Tell me. Now.
Before I kill you.
Do you want to find your dad, or do you want to kill me?
Where's my dad?
-Tell me! -Here.
They found Jun-yeong.
They found him, but…
But what? Why can't you say?
Where's Woo Jun-yeong?
Jeez, I wanted to lie low for the time being.
You ruined my plans.
How will you make up for this?
I'll do anything.
Let my dad go.
Really?
In that case,
send a text to Detective Woo Ji-man, and then we'll talk.
You told him you'd text him.
Where is that bastard?
To file a missing person's report, I registered your DNA.
And the unclaimed body found in the reservoir a year ago
is most likely a relative of yours.
-Return to the station now-- -Jun-yeong's dead?
That's ridiculous.
I'm going to bed now.
I will be in touch tomorrow.
Send.
Why are you doing this to me?
What did I do wrong?
I found your phone.
What?
Do I need a special reason?
You're doing this to me just for the hell of it?
Why did you leave such a personal thing in a random place?
What are you going to do now?
That's completely up to the people you know.
In the next 24 hours,
if just one of these contacts gets in touch with you, I'll let you live.
if just one of these contacts gets in touch with you, I'll let you live. But, Na-mi, that hasn't happened thus far.
But, Na-mi, that hasn't happened thus far.
We live in a world where we're connected by the touch of a finger.
Ironically, it also means we can be disconnected just as easily.
That's what will likely to happen to you.
Okay, then.
Choose.
Kill me now,
or run while you still can.
You'll get yourself killed trying to save your dad.
Then tell me where my dad is.
You can tell me that much.
Excuse me.
I have to use the bathroom.
Dad!
Welcome.
Let him go.
Drop that first.
Dad…
Enough with the drama.
Tie your legs together.
Now turn around.
On your knees with your hands behind you.
Stop! Please stop!
You had your chances.
This was your choice.
Dad.
Dad.
I'm sorry.
Dad.
Don't worry. Just hang in there.
How moving.
You should've been a good daughter.
I did what I was told.
You should keep your word.
Of course. I'll keep my word, no matter what.
You know what, Na-mi?
No one contacted your dad.
I'll keep my word.
Dad, no! No!
Oh my God!
You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
I'm sorry.
I apologize.
I'll do anything you want.
Please let him go.
Please.
Please let my dad go.
Do you mean that?
Anything. I'll do anything.
Then you kill him.

NO TEXTS, ONLY CALLS!
Drop it.
Drop it, you piece of shit!
What? He's that asshole.
Who the hell are you?
Where's Lee Na-mi?

What? This crazy bastard.
I know Jun-yeong's not dead.
Where's Jun-yeong?
Dad.
I'm Jun-yeong.
It's me. I'm your son, Jun-yeong!
You're the one who turned me into this!
Please stop hitting me.
It hurts so much.
Dad.
You fell for it.
Jeez, that imbecile couldn't kill anyone.
Where's Jun-yeong?

DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS LET'S MEET UP AND TALK
OFFICER SHOOTS - CULPRIT UNCONSCIOUS
"A" targeted by serial killer after dropping her phone.
The perp wasn't registered when he was born…
When he wakes up, they'll try to determine his identity.
In an era where smartphones are a necessity,
this could happen to any one of us…
I FOUND KIRKE'S COFFEE SHOP SHE'S REALLY HERE
REALLY? WHERE IS IT?
-I SHOULD GO CHECK IT OUT -TELL HER WE'RE ROOTING FOR HER
GO KIRKE!
Wake up! Should I use a crane to hoist you up now?
Good God, this girl is impossible!
Will you get up or not?
Oh, God!
Not fair, Mom.
You just had to come between Shikhar and me!
Have you made some kind of vow?
Who? Me?
No, child. You've made a vow to embarrass your parents.
And Shikhar who? That darn Pandey's son?
Oh, Mom!
Stop it!
Every day, it takes me a while to wake you up!
Now, hurry up! I won't come and wake you up again!
What's all the commotion about in the morning?
I was trying to wake your princess up.
Now, you get her dressed.
Or if you want, I'll put on a pink dress and meet the groom's family!
You could, daughter-in-law.
I'm sure they have never seen a seahorse dressed in pink before.
What did you say, Mother?
What did you say?
Me? I haven't said a thing!
I've been waiting for a cup of tea since morning,
but did anyone ask?
You haven't given Mom her tea yet?!
You know she is diabetic!
Good Lord, Mother, you're such a liar!
She's had three cups of tea since morning.
There's no end to this mother-son drama!
I'm making more tea!
Mom!
And you… hurry up and get dressed!
-Tito is a very clever boy. -Oh, okay.
-I mean Ratan. -Yeah.
-We call him Tito. -I see.
-Tito? -Yes.
It's a lovely name.
You didn't try the sweets yet.
-Please try some. It's special. -Sure.
Tito?
So… what are your dreams?
-Dream? -Yes.
I own a ball bearing shop.
I dream to own a couple more.
Ball bearing shops.
What's the point of having so many ball bearing shops in Meerut?
I haven't thought about that yet.
Well…
I don't know what your expectations are from a wife,
but I want to tell you what I expect from my life.
I've done Mass Communication.
I've also applied for a job.
I wish to go to Delhi
and become a sports presenter for a sports channel.
Come again?
Sports presenter.
You must have seen a cricket match.
Those women who--
Who dress scarcely and trot on the cricket ground?
Those are cheerleaders…
and that's their costume.
Look…
these are my videos.
I've written and directed them.
The impeccable fielding played a crucial role in India's victory today.
This is what I wish to do. Sports presenter.
Those who review the matches with the experts
during and after the match.
Even they dress pretty scarcely.
I am sorry if I upset you.
But it's a good thing.
I know you want to say no.
Even you want to say no?!
But listen,
you must give a different reason to your family.
-Like-- -The truth?
-What? -I'll tell them the truth.
Pardon me, Rajshri…
but you look extra healthy to me.
It's called obese, not healthy.
I am overweight,
and you're far too underweight.
So, pardon me,
but no one on this terrace is healthy.
But there is an idiot.
So, finish the snack, and get going.
Like the wind!
Idiot!
Rajshri…
don't mind, but what you aspire to be…
you'll have to lose some weight for that as well.
Because the world's an idiot like me.
Good luck.
Our princess knew for a month that the boy's family is coming over.
I kept telling her over and over again, "Child, do some cardio.
Or just do some keto."
But no! If she had done keto, she wouldn't have been rejected by Tito!
But she didn't skip a single paratha this month.
And you…
keep your face buried in the newspaper!
Do I have to keep reminding you that our daughter has turned 30?
If this continues, soon, her scandal will be in that newspaper of yours!
Why don't you get off her back?
-Get off her back?! -Exactly.
Am I her ill-wisher?
Don't I love my child?
Exactly.
Just like you love her, someone else will too.
Fine.
I will stop worrying about her.
Because Jeevan Trivedi has predicted
that Ayushmann Khurrana will come for his princess
and swoop her off her feet!
Why should I interfere?
I'm tired of this now!
Who pays heed to me in this house anyway!
You all think this is nothing but drama!
Do whatever you want!
Welcome back to sports live!
As we've just seen on the big screen, Edgbaston cricket ground is all set
to host the second T-20 International between India and England.
Now, the big question of the night is…
will India seize the series, or will England fight back to level it!
While players are warming up for the blockbuster clash…
What you're saying is absurd!
This! You're saying this armhole is for XL?!
It's smaller than a rat hole.
You guys have tagged it wrong, mister. How is it the customer's fault?
Madam, this is size XL.
See, it's written here.
There's something written on your face as well.
What should I do? Read it out aloud?
Look, mister, even I deal in garments. I am a designer.
This armhole cannot be for XL.
-It's not even for large! -Saira.
-What? -Saira--
Just pay him, and get it over with.
I'm ready to pay three times the price.
I am not denying it.
Just let him admit his mistake.
This is not XL. Simple.
-Uncle, am I right? -Yes, 100%.
See!
-Do you want more proof? -No, madam, I don't.
I'll generate the bill. Just make the payment.
I admit that we labeled the wrong size.
It's our fault.
See, it was such a minor thing,
but you overexaggerated.
Now, show me one size bigger in this stock.
Sorry, ma'am, this is the biggest size we had.
And you just made us realize that this isn't XL.
It's large.
So, you won't get a bigger size here.
Your bill.
Damn!
Seven full and one half.
Now, you have seven and a half dresses.
If you still can't decide what you're going to wear tonight,
then don't call yourself a bloody designer!
Sorry, dude.
I was already hyper,
and then that store guy made me lose my mind.
What's the big deal?
It's just dinner.
I am meeting Viren's group for the first time.
I have to look bloody hot!
Yeah, right.
What?
I don't know, man.
All I'm saying is that guy wore a stinking T-shirt
when he met your friends for the first time.
And you bought the entire Shahpur Jat.
He came straight from the gym.
That's the point.
He didn't even feel the need to shower,
and you're getting finicky as a bride!
Saira, you're going to be a designer.
You'll soon own a store here.
I once asked him what he's done in life and what he wants to do.
He said, "I've done high school in Ludhiana,
and now, Saira will make me international."
I am sure his IQ is so bad that he can't even spell IQ.
-Seriously! -Wow!
You really hate him.
And thanks, Meera.
It's amazing to know that just like the rest of the world,
even my best friend has judged whether I should be with my boyfriend or not.
No, Saira, I--
And Viren or my opinion doesn't count in all this, does it?
Because what does it matter, right?
Saira, I--
Saira, listen.
Hear me out, Saira.
What is it?
I am sorry, Saira.
I am concerned for you, that's all.
I am really sorry, okay?
Are you happy?
Because that's all that matters.
Now, drop me off at home, and don't you want to get dressed?
You have to look stunning
for our high school pass-out brother-in-law.
Yes, let's go.
Hey!
Come, baby!
I missed you so much! Wow! Champagne!
-Wine. -Great.
But why do you do all these formalities?
Thanks, baby. Come on.
Are these your friends, or are they auditioning for Miss India?
These guys?!
They are friends of my friends and their friends.
You know the system, baby.
My buddies are over there.
KD, Param, Amrin.
Guys, Saira!
-Hi. -Hi!
Come on.
He said "bet," so bro also said "bet."
And Saira,
bro here drank six protein shakes back to back.
And that idiot got knocked out in just four.
The entire gym looked stunned.
Baby, you drank six protein shakes back to back?!
Do you know how unhealthy that is?
It's just a protein shake, baby. Unhealthy?
-Six?! -Absolutely.
Saira, I told the same story to my girlfriend
replacing protein shakes with whiskey. Even she said it's unhealthy.
Now, I told you they were protein shakes, but you even called them unhealthy!
Guess I'm only left with poison, then!
You guys look so cute together.
Very beauty and the beast.
Thank you.
-Cheers to that. -Cheers.
-Cheers! -Cheers!
-Hello. -Saira…
What's up, Khanna Senior?
The channel people have agreed to fund your fashion travelogue.
What?!
-Really? -Yes.
Oh my God! Bro, I love you! You're the best!
Okay, I have to tell Viren. I'll call you later, bye.
Oh, God!
This Viren-Saira relationship is going nowhere.
Shut up. That's not right.
Give it to me.
Actually, even I think so.
For Viren, Saira is just a…
I don't know.
-Just a… -Just a what, man?
You two are so judgmental.
Oh, come on, Amrin.
Isn't it obvious?
He came to Delhi to become a model,
and she is a designer.
Simple.
Why else would Viren be sleeping on a piece of an oversized mattress
at this age? For mental peace?
God, Nidhi, you're mean!
I am just honest, man.
See, Viren gets everything he wants from Saira.
And in exchange, Saira gets from Viren
what that poor thing can't get anywhere else.
Did you even see what she was wearing?
Oh, God.
Pass it here, babe.
Hey!
Baby, what happened?
What are you doing here?
Waiting to party.
Waiting to party? What do you mean?
My brother called.
The people over at his channel loved my idea.
The budget is low, but…
Viren, we're going to London to shoot a travelogue for my clothes.
Travelogue?
You said we're going to make a fashion film.
That's what travelogue is, silly.
If the funders like the film,
I'll have my own brand, my own label.
I've been looking all over for you.
Man! And this is how you were going to break this big news to me?!
Smile, my star designer, our dreams are coming true!
Our dreams!
Dreams?!
What dreams?
When did you see them and why?
Will you speak up, or should I fetch the broom?
They are my dreams, Mom.
Why should I ask you for permission or anyone else?
I want to be a sports presenter,
and that's what the interview letter is.
God!
Are you listening, Mr. Timepass Trivedi?
At least, snap out of your newspaper world now!
Otherwise, your daughter will push our world into the darkness.
Princess here wants to go to Delhi
and become a news reader!
Sports presenter.
-Thanks, Grandma. -Anytime.
Are you all out of your mind?
Is this a joke?
First, she swelled up like a balloon.
I kept wailing, but you two kept dozing.
Now, she's persistent about humiliating the family
in front of the entire community!
I'm barking like a dog, and you two look least concerned.
What reputation and what community?
No one even knows us except for our neighbors.
And if she wants to accomplish something because she can,
then let her.
Why is it so shocking?
Oh, wow! What a brilliant thought!
High thinking! Women's welfare!
Excellent, Mr. Trivedi!
Fine!
But she must get married first! Only then can she leave! That's it!
Then it'll be between her and her husband!
She won't become a news anchor on my watch!
-Sports presenter. -Thanks, Grandma.
Anytime.
Laugh.
Laugh all you want!
Make fun of me all you like!
But I won't let it happen as long as I am alive!
Never!
Do you know that mothers get blamed
when girls remain unmarried?
I've been through it.
I've experienced it first-hand.
I've been chasing after my weight…
since I turned 30.
I've turned 55, but still, I couldn't catch up to it.
And my blood runs through your body.
You've turned 30!
Believe me, if you don't get married now, you never will!
Kill me first, and then go wherever you wish to!
You can leave! Just kill me first!
Fine, I'll tear it up.
I don't want to fulfill my dreams by taking your life.
I'm just making an effort, Mom.
And when have I ever turned you down for anything?
I know you're not my ill-wisher. You worry for me.
But you should try to understand as well.
I've been shortlisted among dozens of applicants.
They must've noticed something in me.
It's been my childhood dream.
Call it my fixation.
If you don't support your child's resolution, then who will?
Then, I have a condition.
If you get this job,
then I'll pacify myself.
But if you don't, Gappu,
then you'll marry first, and then think about your dreams.
Done. Promise. Done deal. Done.
Love you, Mom.
And you won't stay alone in the hotel…
until the interview is not over.
You will stay at Aunt Roli's place.
Come on, Mom!
Aunt Roli!
There she is.
-How are you? -I am good.
-Uncle… -No, please, no formalities.
You look healthier than before!
Am I right?
Right, Auntie.
But you look pretty slim.
From which angle?
Have a sense of humor, do you?
Pick up the suitcase.
Wow!
Nice paint, Auntie.
Keep your footwear here next to the shoe rack.
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
God bless.
Sit down. I'll get you some water.
God bless, child. God bless.
I've tidied up the room next door for you.
It used to belong to Amrita.
How is Amrita?
How would she be?
She's doing great.
You know, her husband moved to Elbowkarke.
Elbow who?
He was in San Hose first.
From there, he moved to Elbowkarke.
These are the names of American cities. You wouldn't know.
From San Jose to Albuquerque.
Yes, so what did I say wrong?
Even I said Elbowkarke.
Don't act too smart!
By the way, where is your interview?
Okhla.
So, child, you'll go directly to the interview
and come back home straight.
You see, your uncle has a sound reputation here.
Everyone knows him.
And if you digress,
he will know it first.
Automatically.
You see, child,
teaching physics alone wasn't enough.
So, we thought of starting a private detective firm.
So, we find out everything…
automatically.
I got it, Auntie.
From home to interview, and interview to home. Okay, good night.
Brother, what a surprise!
Come!
You must not have eaten anything properly since morning. I knew it.
Your thought crossed my mind, so I left the office early.
On the way, I came across Saleem's.
So, I got you some kebab rolls. Have them.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Your designs are always amazing.
Because I am your sister.
Because they are really good.
Once the shoot goes well,
it will be really amazing.
I hope you've looked into that.
By the way, who is your director?
He's Viren's friend.
He's experienced.
But most importantly, it's free of cost because of Viren.
Look, you chose London, I didn't say a thing.
But… I hope you're okay with that.
Brother…
we're both British by birth.
Where else would I be more okay than in London?
Come on, you joke about everything.
A sense of humor is important.
How long will we keep remembering London as our horrible past?
Imagine that we're going to create new memories.
And wouldn't it be amazing if I can start my brand
in the same place where Dad started?
What happened?
Did I get too emotional?
No. It fits your size.
Bro!
So, where is Viren?
He is at home.
He wanted to meet me, but I said no.
Brother…
you look too cute when you silently try to look out for me.
Why don't you do it directly?
Because you don't let me.
Since you bought this studio apartment, you've settled down here. Alone.
Even today, I thought Viren or Meera would be here, but no.
You're completely immersed in work.
Now, you'll wake up only after you return from London.
Brother, I didn't thank you only.
-Thank you for the… -Kebab rolls?
Listen, go over to Viren's place.
Have dinner with him. He'll feel nice.
That's actually not such a bad idea.
Right? See you, then.
Brother!
You're the bestest!
That I am.
Drive safe, love you. Bye.
You took so long, brother.
I've been waiting for so long--
Sorry, sir. There was a lot of traffic.
Saira, baby, you?!
What are you doing here?
Didn't you have that design thing? What was that?
-You mean sampling. I was doing just that. -Yeah.
Then, suddenly brother came over with all this.
He thought we'd be together.
-Okay. -So I started missing you, and here I am.
Great.
Which delivery were you waiting for?
Yeah, I was waiting for the chemist delivery guy.
I ordered some--
I ordered… Digene.
My stomach's been grumbling since morning,
so I thought I'd order some medicine.
Doesn't matter. Plate the kebabs while they're still hot.
Let's eat it. Then, you have to leave for work.
Your stomach's grumbling and you want to eat kebabs?!
Baby, you brought them for me so fondly,
so I will eat--
My stomach will be fine. I'll tell him to go back. I don't want the medicine.
Sir, your delivery.
Come back tomorrow.
-Tomorrow? -Yes.
You called me a dozen times and gave me a headache.
Now you're telling me to come back tomorrow.
You--
I would've fallen off my bike because of you.
Alright, I'm sorry! Forgive me!
I said I don't want it.
-I'm fine now-- -Why are you sending him back?
-Give it to me. -No, I'll take it.
-Is this Digene? -Yes.
Did you want that too?
Why didn't you tell me? I would've got that as well.
I mean…
Whose parcel is this?
-I had asked for Digene. -When?
-You rascal… -Sir, my money?
Baby, listen to me! Where are you going?
There is nothing in there!
-Move! -Listen to me!
There is nothing in there! What are you looking for?
Don't go inside, or you will slip.
He brought someone else's parcel.
Baby, there is nothing there.
There is nothing there, baby. I am telling you.
Bloody hell!
Saira… I can explain!
You like to strip, don't you?
Then, stay like that!
Baby, you're locking her up.
-Baby, listen to me-- -Shut up!
Just shut up!
Meera kept telling me…
but I never listened to her.
I can't believe I thought I could make a life with you!
Baby…
Sorry, Saira.
It's very cold out here.
Sorry.
You know what?
Screw you!
Right here. Yes, here.
That way, please. I'll bring your script.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Are you rehearsing something?
What? Yeah!
This is some technical bull.
I mean, 14 overseas test wins over the last three years,
and some overseas Indian ODI records…
and what the hell is a bloody joe root anyway?
-It's not a what, it's a who. -What?
Joe Root is the root of India's trouble in England.
Sorry, what?
Nothing. You continue.
Ma'am, your script.
Puja Poddar!
Yeah, that's me!
Come.
Saurav, I understand your problem…
but it took me quite an effort
to get this approved from the channel head.
Now, I can neither increase the budget
nor postpone it.
If you don't have a director,
you'll have to cancel it, bro.
I am sorry.
Rajshri!
Yes.
-Trivedi, right? -Yes.
We're already done with the selections. Your audition will not be needed anymore.
-Thank you. -Not needed?!
Madam! Madam, listen!
Madam.
Madam, I came all the way from Meerut.
Why won't you audition me?
Just hold on.
It's not my call.
-We asked you for your pictures, right? -Yes.
-You sent us your pictures. -Yeah.
But it's clearly mentioned in our selection criteria…
"Images shortlisted based on appearance and demeanor
-will be then auditioned--" -Yes, but I sent you my pictures, madam!
I did send them.
I just want one chance. I'm only asking you for one chance.
This is my only opportunity. I won't get it again. Please try to understand.
Rajshri, you're not listening.
It's not my call.
That gentleman who was pacing the halls…
-was my boss. -Okay.
He came to see the pictures.
He took one look at your pictures and said--
"She's obese."
That's what he said, right?
"She's obese."
He said she's too healthy, didn't he?
Look, madam,
this is all I've ever wanted to do since I was 19.
I followed cricket to increase my knowledge.
Ask me anything about cricket.
-Ask me. -Look, what can I--
See, it's just my job.
He's my boss.
So he thinks he can do anything?!
Was Charu Sharma selected by a photo?
Was he?
Or did anyone ask Harsha Bhogle for his waist size?
Or was Gaurav Kapoor rejected for being too skinny?
No.
They were asked about their cricketing knowledge.
Interest in the game, research, and trivia.
These were the questions asked. But girls…
You can ask Bret Lee about leg spin,
but you must look hot in a dress.
Why?
Look, I am really very sorry.
-But these requirements criteria-- -Who made these guidelines requirements?
-Who made them? -I don't know!
Maybe the channel's owner did.
Fine!
I came all the way from Meerut!
Don't give me the job if you don't want to…
but I swear to God, I will give your owner a piece of my mind!
Call him here!
-Call him right now! -Now?
Yes, right now!
He is in London.
What?
I mean, the Indian team is on a tour of England, and he's with them.
Okay, fine. Happens sometimes.
No one imagined this.
But I'm sure there has to be a way to work around it. Right, Meera?
Anyway, models are not a problem, brother.
-Right. -Saira found its solution in the morning.
She will use the locals at their workplace.
That will make it look genuine.
I'm sure we'll work something out.
Why are you trying to act normal?
You know the visa applications have to go out tomorrow.
We had to meet the cameraman from your channel today.
Why don't you just say it when you know it?
"It can't be done, Saira."
It can't be done!
Actually, you always say it,
but I never listen.
You had told me…
that nothing good would come out of that piece of meat.
You had also told me.
But Saira Khanna has this old habit…
to dream beyond what she deserves.
She wants a boyfriend like Hrithik Roshan…
even if she weighs 100 kilos herself!
-Saira! -Wait--
Saira!
You know why this happens to you.
You know, don't you?
Chomping on pizzas and burgers!
Hogging on chocolate mousse!
Go on!
You deserve this, Saira!
You freaking deserve this!
Where the hell is the tissue?
Where is it?
Sorry.
I… took the box inside.
I was crying alone before you came in.
So, I didn't expect it.
It's okay.
Are you okay?
What happened?
It hasn't happened yet…
but it will now.
My wedding in Meerut.
With some idiot who owns a ball bearing shop.
Did you run away from home?
No.
But I am not too keen to go back.
Were your dreams crushed too?
They are now.
Years of hard work has gone down the drain
because of some idiot whom I called my boyfriend.
Screw it.
I understood from the way you were crying…
that your grief is as bad as mine.
Hold this.
Let me show you.
See…
this is my social media page.
I have 2600 followers in Meerut.
It's not as big as this channel, but this is my passion.
See!
I shot and edited this on my own.
Let's discuss the two big reasons for the outcome of today's match.
Toss and dew.
And these guys didn't even let me audition.
They didn't even care to ask. Why?
They couldn't see the size of my dreams.
They could only see my size.
SG's balls are used only in Indian tests.
West Indies and England use Duke,
and the rest of the world uses Kookaburra.
The camerawork…
Did you shoot this yourself?
Even you're taking me lightly.
I've done Mass Communication at Kanpur University.
Have you ever done anything related to fashion?
I mean anything related to clothes?
No.
Actually, yes.
I shot an ad for Bubbly Garments on cable TV.
But why? Why are you asking?
I told you my sob story considering you a friend,
and you're interviewing me!
Look…
Here.
Wipe your tears.
-And think for a minute before you answer. -Okay.
What do you want to do after this?
Me?
I don't want to get married.
And I want to show that bloody channel owner, Atul Chabra,
that he won't find a better sports presenter than me!
But he's in London.
And what if you can be in London in a week?
Me? How?
Look, I don't know if you can realize your dreams in London or not,
but if you help me,
you won't have to go back to Meerut
and marry some idiot ball bearing shop owner.
Would you like something? Tea or coffee?
Water? Anything?
Do you have weed?
Hemp?
I am kidding.
I carry my own.
So, the stylist…
When is she expected?
Sorry, my Hindi isn't the best.
She just had to make a few calls, so she stepped outside.
She'll be right back.
Your Hindi is also not good?
Why are you talking in English?
Srikanth…
except for camerawork,
have you ever directed anything?
I mean for the channel
or something independently.
No.
Why?
Don't you have a director?
We have a director, guys!
We have a director!
And she's an amazing director! God, I love her work!
Meet…
Shit, what's your name?
Rajshri. Rajshri Trivedi.
-And you are? -Saira Khanna.
Hello, Saira.
You guys are funny.
Srikanth Srivardhan.
-Hi. -Your cameraman.
-Hi. -Hello.
-Have you done any work before? -Yes, a lot of work.
You? First time?
Papa, I got appointed immediately.
They said I'll be presenting the London series.
That's amazing.
Awesome.
See you, Auntie.
-I'll call you from London. -Okay.
We'll see you on TV next.
Yes!
Don't know
Don't know who
Don't know

Unfamiliar path, vivid heart

Where is it going to take me?

All my wishes seem magical to me
Even a drop seems like the ocean
Maybe expectations are Bigger than my boundaries
I wish to live them all
You don't know where

The winds are going to take me
Don't know

-Srikanth! -Yeah!
-Director sir. -Yes?
Where is your luggage?
It was here a minute ago.
You're looking over the horizon,
but your luggage is in your backyard.
Oh, God!
I'll get it.
It's cold, right? It's very cold.
-Hi. -Hi.
-That is yours? -This is mine.
This is mine.
-Okay. Bye. -Thank you. Bye.
My brother said the line producer would send a driver.
Can you see our names anywhere?
Names…
I'm back.
Is that it?
Shaira…
You're kidding me.
Hey! Hello!
Excuse me!
Why did she get an accent?
Excuse me.
Are you from Topline Productions?
Hi.
Are you Shaira Khan?
I am Zorawar Rehmani.
But… you can call me Zo, Za, Zu.
Anything you like.
Zorawar Rehmani, did you know that we've been waiting here for 20 minutes?
Wow, really?
But why?
Even I've been here for 20 minutes.
Why were you waiting?
You could've just come over.
Because my name isn't Shaira Khan
but Saira Khanna.
You should've checked my name before coming here.
Oh, shit.
You see, the intern in our office took the details.
Poor white chick.
What can I say?
These white folks ruled over us for 150 years,
but they still can't tell the difference between Khanna and Khan.
-Okay-- -Anyway, Saira, now that we've met--
Can you talk less?
Come on, guys! Found him… the driver!
Bro?
Do you mind?
Zo bro.
One life, bro. Go for it.
Here's your hotel.
-Shall we get down? -No, wait a minute.
What?
Ma'am.
What about these, ma'am?
You can put those in the other room.
Thanks for sharing your room.
I had to set up in the other room.
Now you're embarrassing me.
You're sharing your dreams with me. Can't I share a room with you?
Saira, I came here with you…
lying to my parents.
I acted a bit selfish.
But I don't know if I'll be of any use to you.
Do you wish to be of any use?
Completely.
Then, you'll be of good use to me.
Yes, but I don't understand fashion one bit.
You know, Rajshri,
I've been hearing it since I was in the fashion institute.
"This fatso doesn't fit in any design.
What is she going to design?"
And yet,
I never wanted anything more than to see my own label in the world.
It became a passion.
Do you know why I brought you here?
Because you may not understand fashion,
but you understand passion.
That I do.
So, what's the plan?
We'll have to check out the locations, but--
What?
Don't tell me!
He isn't here yet?! Hello, where is your line producer?
Hello, Saira! I am Zorawar Rehmani!
The line producer of your project!
I hope my driver brought you here comfortably.
Did he bore you? That idiot is very talkative.
He's not an idiot, sir.
Your driver is superb.
He allowed me to smoke up in the car only.
Right?
You also like him, right, director sir?
Yes…
Okay, so, Zorawar, right?
Zo, Za, Zu… call me whatever you like.
You're the line producer, right?
We sent you a list of locations from Delhi to…
to your team. Did you figure it out?
That? Yes, of course.
-You sent us 15 locations. -Yes.
But only two fit your budget.
What to do?
Two?
-No, this is not possible. -Then how--
Rajshri and I planned everything according to the locations--
Saira, it's okay.
It's okay. Relax.
I am here.
I had a word with your brother when you were on the flight.
You want to make a fun film to show your funders.
In that, you want to show your clothes, and London,
so that the funders write a check to fund your boutique, right?
Right. Absolutely right.
Right.
I'll get the job done…
but not with the meetings and location lists.
No Hollywood style.
Desi style.
Costumes in the car,
and the camera on the shoulder. We can take any model we find.
Then, the whole of London will be our shooting stage.
Cameraman. Director.
Are you with me?
I love this guy, man.
Me too.
Alright.
Then, let's get to know the city…
and each other.
Let's get this show on the road.
Any doubt?
But--
Okay, then, Zorawar Rehmani.
Wait!
-Cheers. -Cheers.
So, she got this bitter because of a boyfriend with a low IQ!
Look…
I told you because you asked out of concern.
Now, don't reveal it to Saira.
How do we say it?
She hasn't moved on yet.
She still gets affected when he calls her.
There's a thing called the Bro Code, brother.
Sister.
I mean, come on!
The secret of Delhi is out.
Now, let's hear the story of Meerut.
-Srikanth! -Yeah?
Don't tell me you carried this stuff on the flight.
-Actually-- -Don't tell me. I don't want to know.
I don't want to be an accomplice.
Listen…
Rajshri will need our help.
She has never executed anything like this.
I haven't either.
What?!
I mean, wildlife documentaries and fashion films are…
What do you say?
There's a difference.
Well, at least, I hope there is.
One last. I swear, sister.
Rohit Sharma.
Oh, come on!
Test average 46.1,
ODI 49, T20 32.5,
test century eight,
and ODI 29 including three double centuries, and four in T20.
But there's an ongoing series. Maybe something has changed today.
Mind-blowing, sister!
Superb!
Why don't you meet that channel guy Atul Chabra?
He's right here in London.
Atul Chabra is not some lamb that we can run after and catch.
I never imagined you'd say something like this
with me around.
Atul Chabra is nothing.
Just say the word.
I can even arrange your meeting with King Charles in Buckingham Palace.
You don't believe me.
Don't.
You'll believe me when I get it done.
Pick up your drink.
Pick it up.
Now, watch.
You two came to London with a dream, right?
You'll go back only after you fulfill them.
That's Zorawar Rehmani's promise.
Cheers.
-She looks nice, doesn't she? -Yes, she does. Come.
-Thank you very much. -And action!
-Hey… who will say "camera"? -Sorry!
Camera!
Action!
Ready to owe myself that place
Never give up in this case
Gonna leave a mark and leave it so well
Making sure I never get replaced
You can say whatever you want about me You may have never seen a woman like me
You can push me down But you can't knock me out
Ain't no way my luck is gonna ever run out
-What's he doing now? -I don't know. He must have a plan.
Guys!
Model. Location.
-Come. -Let's go.
Go around, and…
I hope you're going to be paying us.
How you'd wish, darling.
I'll take you on a date if the shot goes well though.
So, as I was saying…
-I can't see the detail of the earring. -Okay.
Smile.
Cut!
-Come on, take a low shot. -Hey!
-Hey, run! -Stop!
Rajshri, I love you.
Finally, I have faith in Kanpur University's Mass. Comm.
This is brilliant!
Saira, we're not even halfway there.
Correct.
Don't praise the director yet.
It will go to her head.
She might ask for more money.
And she should.
This talent should never come for free.
Why did you order the entire restaurant?
Madam, we, brother-sister, are celebrating.
You can join us if you feel like it.
Celebrate?
What are we celebrating?
So, sister, as you know…
the Indian team is here playing a series.
Since they are here,
the commentary team is also here.
And the commentary team only meets VIPs.
And VIPs are drawn to your brother like a magnet.
So, one of those VIPs turned out to be Kapil Dev's friend.
I said my sister is very talented.
He immediately said…
"This is not a big deal.
I'll fix a small interview with Kapil sir for her videos."
-I said if you're insisting-- -No!
You did not! Zorawar!
Zo, Za, Zu… call me whatever you like!
Wait. Zorawar, if this is a prank,
then stop now.
I won't say anything.
And what if I am serious?
As I said, sister,
if I have it my way,
I can even arrange your meeting with King Charles in Buckingham Palace.
We'll get 30 minutes.
Tomorrow in Shangrila.
That's enough.
-We'll have a three-camera setup. -Yes!
Yeah! Let's do this!
Saira.
Listen, Ms. Meerut.
When you upload this video, you're going to create a sensation.
Don't forget to mention below, "Styled by Saira Khanna," got it?
Are you pulling my leg?
Am I looking okay?
Guys, the setup is ready.
Zo is saying Kapil sir's meeting is almost over.
He'll be down in five. Are we good?
Could we be any better?
Wow! Super, mama!
What? Am I looking like a mama?
Stop it!
Up. Own it.
Up! Own it!
-Own it! -Own what?
-Let's go. -Saira, give me my glasses back.
So, your three-camera setup is done. Do you need anything else?
No, not really.
We're already done with the selections. Your audition will not be needed anymore.
Thank you.
What you aspire to be…
you'll have to lose some weight for that as well.
Dreams?! What dreams?
When did you see them and why?
-Hi. How are you? -Hello. I'm good, sir.
Sir, I am Rajshri Trivedi.
-That's Srikanth, our DOP, -Hello, sir.
and that's Saira.
Hi. Sorry, I cannot spend much time here.
I have to go to Lords for high tea.
Otherwise, I would've definitely…
No, absolutely, sir. We appreciate what little time you spared for us.
Well, you're doing such a good job for the orphans,
then why not?
Orphans?
Yes, your colleague said there are some 150 kids in the orphanage.
Yes, sir. Orphanage.
-Yeah. -Right, 150 kids.
-Sir, shall we begin? -Yeah, sure.
Three, two, one, roll cameras.
Rolling.
With us is the Indian Cricket World's legend,
who's really soft-spoken as opposed to his firey bowling.
Arguably, the world's best-ever all-rounder.
Haryana Hurricane, Mr. Kapil Dev.
You don't want this conversation with Kapil sir to end…
but as the tradition of cricket has it,
no matter how good the bowler is,
the over comes to an end after six balls.
Sir, we're so grateful you could spare some time for us.
With love from every fan across the world,
and also from me.
-Thank you very much. -Thank you.
Cut.
I knew in the first five minutes…
that you don't have an orphanage.
But looking at your passion--
I've done so many interviews,
but the fun I had with you is rare to find.
Keep up the spirit.
I really enjoyed myself. Don't lie ever again.
-Bye, sir. -Bye.
-Yes! -We could've been jailed, you fool!
-We'd be dead. -She bowled Kapil sir out.
Who cares even if we do go to jail?
The compliment he gave to the director in the end…
also got recorded on the master camera.
Another one for the table, darling.
-Yes. -Hey, Zo! He'll get us all in trouble!
I'm going to drink all night
because Ms. Meerut rocked London today.
Right, Srikanth?
I am on if you guys are…
I am very happy today.
You guys know I don't say much.
Correct.
Because my Hindi is also…
But I will try today.
-We will! -Yes!
Go, Srikanth!
Rajshri…
I know about the problems you faced.
I know you lied and became a director for the first time.
All these things that you did, you do…
are very…
very courageous.
Brave.
Because I know you think…
you think the channel not giving you a chance is your failure!
No.
No. It's not.
And today, Kapil Dev told you that it's not.
I am very happy.
This table is having too much fun…
-without us. -Yeah.
Yeah! Get us in on it, pretty boys!
Hey, gorgeous. So, we're here to celebrate these beautiful women,
who are here to chase their dreams,
and to tell them not to doubt themselves too much while they do that.
Doubt? Pray tell, why would you doubt yourself, you sexy thang?
Exactly!
Sexy, and us?
No, these are Saira's clothes.
What sexy?
What are you talking about, sugar?
Are you second-guessing if you can pack some heat into those clothes too?
-What? -I do?!
You bet that sexy ass, you do!
Now, come on! Let's get this party started!
-Yes! -Come on!
Let's do that!
I am super happy tonight.
And when I am super happy, I sing.
And when I sing,
I sing only in Tamil.
One, two, three, four…
Yeah!
Cheers!
Cool macha, hot baby

Jhumma-Chumma Tamma-Tamma
Lyrics I don't know
Sing what's in your heart
Don't stop the booze flow
Hey, mama, give me that beat
Where I do just clap-clap-clap
One, two, three and repeat
Come, let's do clap-clap-clap
To do kuthu dance We need a fast beat
We need a thappattam To increase the drums' heat
If we increase the volume We'll get intoxicated
But no worries The club rooftop won't fly
The club rooftop
The club rooftop
The club rooftop
The club rooftop won't fly
Hey…
When you sway, the world sways with you
Sways…
Hey…
You'll start a fight in the club
Fight…
-Hey… -Hey…
-Boy, you're such a flippant -Boy, you're such a flippant
Flippant…
-Hey… -Hey…
-A mix of Kamal sir and Rajni sir -A mix of Kamal sir and Rajni sir
Just a little
Whatever or whoever I am
I am your hero
Sing what's in your heart
Don't stop the booze flow
Hey, mama, give me that beat
Where I do just clap-clap-clap
One, two, three, and repeat
Come, let's do clap-clap-clap
Play it one more time
Cool macha, hot baby
Night very tipsy
I am ready, come to Daddy
Atmosphere sexy
Jhumma-Chumma Tamma-Tamma
Lyrics I don't know
Sing what's in your heart
Don't stop the booze flow

-Clap-clap-clap -Clap-clap-clap
-Black cab! -Hey!
-Call the black cab. -We want to go home.
Hey, where are you going?
Hey!
Do you want to make me deaf?
Atul Chabra!
-Here? -Who is Atul Chabra?
Where?
That's not Atul Chabra, that's a statue.
That's not even moving.
He only had one hit sports channel, and they made a bloody statue of him?!
And in London?!
These days, they make your statue over every silly thing.
Don't you know?
Guys, that's Atul Chabra.
Hey…
but who is Atul Chabra?
Sri…
he's the guy whose channel rejected me.
-That bugger? -Yes!
-Rajshri! -Yeah?
Rajshri, come!
-Rajshri, listen! -Wait!
Can you talk to him?
Can you give him a piece of your mind?
Are you drunk?
Doesn't matter how drunk I am,
I will give him a piece of my mind today!
-Hey-- -Wait!
What will you gain from fighting with him?
Nothing.
This is your chance, Rajshri Trivedi.
Srikanth!
That camera footage in which Kapil sir praised her…
do you have it?
-Of course, I do. -Give it to me.
I dumped it onto the laptop from the camera.
-Wow. -That's the last clip I copied.
Do you have a pen drive?
-I do. -Where is it?
Left pocket.
Your left or my left?
-My left. -Okay.
-Rajshri, we're getting the pen drive. Go. -The pen drive is not here…
You have to tell him. Keep him engaged until we get the pen drive.
-Stop him! -Let it go!
-Go! -Atul Chabra!
Where is it?
-Hurry up, guys. -Got it.
Mr. Chabra!
Sir. Hello, sir. Namaste.
Hello.
Your guess is right.
I am drunk.
But hear me out because this is important.
Please hear me out.
-I'm sorry, I'm in a bit of a hurry. -The last clip on camera one?
-Hurry up. -The last clip.
Sir, I tried to become a cricket presenter on your channel…
but they didn't even see my audition.
-It's copying. -Okay.
They said that according to your policy,
I was too large.
Sir, I tried to explain to them
-that cricket is my passion! -Good evening, sir!
I mean good morning, sir.
Sir, Zorawar Rehmani. Topline Productions.
-Big fan, sir. -Shut up.
Sir, what your channel doesn't believe,
-India's world cup-winning captain does. -Yeah.
He said this to me personally
-while giving me an interview. -Sir…
-See it for yourself, sir, and you decide. -Sir!
Sir, she means she loves you.
Really wants to work with you.
One chance. Please take a look, sir.
Rajshri Trivedi. Big fan.
Sir, Rajshri Trivedi.
Sister, say thank you.
-Say thank you quickly. -Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir. -You're God.
-You're welcome. -Bye, sir.
I won't have to marry any guy who sells ball bearings!
Did you copy the last clip?
You said it's the last clip, so I copied the last clip.
Let's go.
Look at this!
Rajshri Trivedi, sports presenter!
Where is she?
Did she have breakfast?
She kept crying till late at night yesterday.
Her mom called.
Do you know what they talked about?
Since last night, I've been thinking…
it's all my fault.
If only I had double-checked…
No, Sri. You know it's not your fault.
We all messed up last night in haste.
I'll talk to her.
Hey, partner, are you going on a diet alone?
Planning to let me stay obese while you lose weight?
Don't hurt yourself by keeping it inside.
Just vent it out and be done with it.
Even that poor Srikanth is cursing himself saying it's all his fault.
He's crazy.
He thinks I'm sitting out here because I'm depressed.
Are you not?
Are you enjoying the view?
Mom called me yesterday before we entered the pub…
to say that Uncle Dinesh has referred some guy for me.
He even said yes after looking at my pictures.
Mom said, "This one's perfect, child.
He's pretty healthy himself.
You two will look cute together."
I kept saying,
"I interviewed Kapil Dev today, Mom.
And Kapil Dev praised me."
But Saira,
nothing made a difference to Mom.
Tell me… how can it be anyone's fault
when I couldn't convince my own mom?
Why would I wail over giving the wrong clip to Chabra?
Would it have mattered if I had given him the right one?
No. That's the truth.
From that idiot model called Viren
to an idiot who owns ball bearing shops in Meerut,
from the modeling institute girls to Atul Chabra…
this is the truth of the entire world!
Unbelievable, right?
A couple of guys formed a standard.
We never realized when that standard was declared normal.
And we losers got in a race for acceptance.
As a kid, we wanted to be accepted by our friends.
As we grew older, we wanted to be accepted in the definition of hot.
Workspace environment.
Just accept us, please.
Just accept us.
That's all we kept saying.
"I am fat, and I still look hotter than your girl, bloody loser.
And I can be a designer, sports presenter,
doctor, CEO, lawyer, or actor.
I'll be whoever I want to be…
and still be obese!
Because you don't feed me!"
That's all we have to say, Rajshri.
-Why can't we say it? -We can't say it.
We can't say it.
Come on, get up.
-Where? -Get up.
-Come on! -Where?
Let me get my jacket.
Hurry up!
Saira, where are we going?
Come on!
Your order, ladies?
One chicken burger.
Make that two. Two each.
-With cheese? -Hell, yeah! With cheese!
One large fries.
-One large nuggets. -Mayo dip.
-Chocolate pancakes. -Waffle.
-Banana milkshake. -Strawberry milkshake.
-Whipped cream on mine. -Wow! Someone's hungry!
Oh, honey, we're just getting started.
Pack it.
Are we going to blow up this building?
This was my school.
Wow. Nice.
I was in fourth grade…
and my brother was in seventh.
It was my science period, I guess.
Mother Suzan called me out of class and took me to the office.
Brother was already there.
Mom arrived after a while.
She looked worried.
Shattered.
Later, we found out that Dad had passed away.
After that, for two years,
Mom tried hard to raise us here.
Until she finally gave up.
She thought, let's take them both back home to India.
Back then, she didn't even realize that it was home only for her.
Not for my brother and me.
We were born here.
We had only heard about Delhi.
We had no choice back then.
At the age of 11,
my world suddenly changed.
Isn't it strange?
Until you don't hear about someone else's grief…
you feel your pain is the worst.
If I were in your shoes,
I would be dead.
Or you'd have made a friend.
Even I tried pretty hard.
First, with the kids of Delhi's Sanskriti School.
And when I couldn't get along with them,
I befriended food.
The food turned out to be one awesome friend.
It's been there from my childhood to adulthood.
Now, let me continue.
I tried to end this friendship, but by now, it had turned into a group.
Food, me, and obesity.
Tired of people's comments,
I tried to make new friends like gym and diet,
but that friendship didn't last.
Sometimes, they were on my side, and sometimes not, but food…
food was my best friend.
I streaked my hair, had my ears, nose, and lips pierced,
and got a big tattoo…
so that the world would notice these things before my obesity.
-Or anything at all. -But this bloody world can find obesity
even beyond Fab India's oversized dress.
Yeah!
Doesn't matter how much you tuck your tummy in,
you can't pull these bloody jeans over the waist.
It gets stuck on your thighs.
And we keep convincing ourselves
that obesity has increased the size of our bras.
But these guys have these weird demands.
They want a big bra size, but they also want a thin waistline like this.
This small!
Rascals, if we demand the same from you,
where will you hide your face?
Look over there.
There are teachers, there are mothers.
They are real women.
Who among them has a perfect figure?
Some run homes, some run offices, and some schools.
They are real role models.
But who will make them a model?
Models are of only one type.
Like this…
You can't see a piece of meat on them.
Anywhere you touch, it's only bones.
They don't leave those skinny models alone either.
She gets body-shamed because she is skinny.
It's all our fault.
The world already judges us, and on top of that, we judge ourselves.
Why can't any of them be a model?
-Of course, they can. -They can't.
Yes, they can be.
They can't be.
They can be.
Really?
Of course, they can be.
Get up.
-Where to? -Let's go.
Saira, I cannot eat anymore.
-Hey! -Come on, Rajshri!
What new brainstorm did she come up with now?
I don't know…
but they went to get a burger for inspiration.
Guys, concentrate.
So, guys, there's a slight change in the brief of our film.
We were pitching clothes for every profession,
every location, and every time,
but we missed a major point.
Every type of body.
Saira Khanna Designs will now pitch its brand
for every size, and every body.
Madam, you can keep every size in your store…
but every other designer also does that.
They keep every size,
but they don't design for every size.
They don't market every size.
I want to do it.
I was to see a plus-size bus driver in my clothes.
A school teacher, a housewife,
everyone who is not a model size,
I want to see all of them in my clothes.
You don't have to fit into the design to wear Saira Khanna.
The designs will be done keeping your bodies in focus.
Every body.
Were you always so convincing,
or is this the effect of London?
Zorawar.
-Or-- -Zo… Za… Zu.
-Correct. -We know it.
But how do we do it?
Is it possible?
For anyone else…
impossible.
But for you… you just have to ask.
You will kill us with your dialogues.
We just need the right start.
Leave that to me.
Let's set up a nice low-angle shot.
From here?
Okay.
Are you sure?
Completely.
What's the worst that could happen?
The funders won't agree to this pitch,
or my brother will get furious.
But that's fine.
This is what I will do because this is the only thing I want to do.
Lovely.
Careful.
-You guys wait here. I'll take her inside. -Okay.
Take care, Saira.
Okay, it doesn't seem to be much more than a sprain.
You need to look after it well, okay?
Not too much pressure and rest.
Look after her well, young man.
With pleasure, doctor.
I've got your prescription. Two minutes.
Thank you, doctor.
Hey, I'll do it.
Do it.
"I'll do it!"
Thanks.
These hospital treatment rooms are so weird.
It's the worst place to be alone with a doctor.
But if you get stuck in here alone with a beautiful girl,
who can't even get up and run,
then…
I hope you do all this to kill time.
Because I neither have a reason to take you seriously
nor do you have any shortage of girls to show off this flippancy.
You don't know the difference between charm and flippancy.
But it's okay.
Listen, I don't give a shit about your charm, okay?
You're doing a job, so stick to that. I, too, am here just for work.
I have no interest in becoming entertainment for you.
It's him?!
Zorawar.
-Zorawar, give me the phone. -Yeah, Viren.
What the…
I am Zorawar.
Zorawar Rehmani.
Where? London.
You asked me two questions.
Now, it's my turn.
What level of stupid are you?
Even after what you did, you still think
you'll have a chance with her if you keep calling?!
You don't have an answer, do you? Because you're an idiot.
-I know! -Give me the phone!
Now, question number two.
In the beginning, what did you do
to make Saira believe that you're good, honest, and genuine?
I need some tips, bro.
Because everything I am doing--
Hello?
Hello, Viren?
Bro…
-Zorawar, give me the phone. -He hung up.
Give me the phone!
Who do you think you are?
Nothing special.
But I am not who you think I am.
I am not Viren, Saira.
Not every guy is.
If you don't stop thinking that way,
then there is no difference between your beliefs and Viren's.
Think about it.
You think I can't hit on you because…
Because?
If I could get up, I would break your jaw.
Do you think if you could get up…
I would have done any of this?
-Am I crazy? -Zorawar!
Doctor, she's hitting me!
All said and done…
Srikanth and I lost the most because of this new brief.
We were getting such cute models.
It kept us engrossed.
This…
this is the problem.
And this is the mentality we've got to change.
My revolutionary sister…
we can't miss out on eye candy for your revolution.
What is eye candy?
Same thing…
but with eyes.
Mom is calling.
Right now?
It must be 5:00 a.m. back home.
Yes. She gets up at 4:30 a.m. every day.
I'll be back.
Hello.
Yeah, Mom.
Can I tell Yogesh's mom and dad that it's final?
What?
No, Mom. Just say no.
Look, Gappu, I've had enough.
Why should I say no?
God knows what you're doing there,
-and you're telling me-- -I'm working-- I'm working, Mom!
If you ever venture out of Meerut and see the world, you'll know.
People do many other things than getting married!
I haven't seen your face in any of the matches yet.
What work is this?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Look, Gappu, you'll listen to me quietly!
We're giving Yogesh's family our approval.
Mom, please!
I cannot say yes like this!
-I need some more-- -Listen to me, Gappu!
Remember what I said to you while giving you permission?
If you achieve something, I'll listen to you.
Otherwise, you'll listen to me!
I see! So, you were waiting for this day…
when your daughter is proven wrong, and you can do as you please!
Then, do whatever you want! Why are you informing me?
Leave me alone!
How long have you been standing there?
For around 15 minutes.
It's pretty late,
Tomorrow is a busy day.
We should turn in for the night.
Director sir…
I overheard your phone conversation.
One has to compromise with the life one gets, Sri.
This is what I got…
and I'm living with it.
Even animals get a life, director sir.
Human beings shape their own life.
Where is it written…
that every person's dreams will come true?
You…
haven't uploaded Kapil sir's video
on the internet yet.
I won't.
I'll keep it for myself.
I'll watch it whenever I feel like it.
If I upload that video,
I'll have expectations… again.
Which will get crushed… again.
My heart will ache… again.
I am tired, Sri.
My marriage has been fixed.
Now, I'll get married.
Sorry.
One moment, director sir.
I wanted to share something with you.
You know… my father…
was crazy about films.
Hindi films, Tamil films.
All of them.
When I told him that I am going to learn camerawork…
he was overjoyed.
Very proud.
He would announce to the entire neighborhood,
"My son will be the next PC Sriram.
He'll work in big films."
Even I was very happy.
My first assignment was
for a wildlife documentary in Brazil.
Three months of very hard work.
Full work.
But…
it was a good shoot.
We…
partied on the last day.
The next day, I had a flight back.
At night, I got a call…
that my dad was no more.
That man waited his entire life
to watch the visual shot by me.
I finally shot it,
but he died before he could see it.
I couldn't be like PC Sriram yet, director sir.
I didn't get a single feature film shoot yet.
But… I didn't give up.
Even if I get a film, and it's shot well,
my father isn't around to watch it.
Yet…
I didn't give up, director sir.
I didn't give up.
So, how could you give up?
How could you?
I'm not as courageous as Srikanth Srivardhan.
Sri…
you'll be like PC Sriram.
And I will watch your first feature film.
In Meerut.
Hi, ladies. Tell me how you're feeling in these outfits today.
We feel fly, darling.
Yeah, I am not worried about what's showing
or what's oozing out.
What do you guys look for when you pick your clothes?
Definitely comfort first.
If you feel suffocated in the clothes, then what good is style?
And a little skin show because that doesn't hurt anyone.
It feels like it was designed for me.
I can feel fashionable but without being afraid.
All out.
People are always talking about eat this, it will help.
Help with what? I didn't ask for help.
I wear what I want when I want.
If you want to be a bunny, continue eating leaves.
Right, it's important to be healthy.
And do everything you need for that.
Just because I don't fit in the size you like
doesn't mean I am any less cute.
Yes!
-Yes! -Guys, it was amazing!
-Oh my God, guys, it's amazing! -Yes!
Thank you!
You guys are the most under-budget and over-efficient crew in the world!
That's true.
Guys, I don't know about you,
but what I saw just now…
is far better than what I imagined.
Saira, just don't forget us when you become a top label.
And don't forget me even if you don't become a top label.
-No? -No.
I don't know, guys.
To be honest, the people in India who are going to decide…
are not expecting this.
So, who knows, maybe there won't be a label at all!
But what does it matter? Who cares?
My effort will always be this.
Proud of you, Saira.
That's the spirit.
So, you'll all be going back the day after tomorrow.
And God knows where fate will take each one of us!
There's a fear of things remaining untold.
So, tonight, you're all invited to my house
to taste Nihari cooked by my mom.
-What? -You have a mom?!
Of course. Did Allah send me by DHL?
No, I mean you never told us she is in London.
You see, I don't invite all my clients home.
You can't trust people
whether they are genuine or flippant. Am I right, madam?
Zorawar…
Or Zo, Za, Zu… whatever you like.
With you, this job didn't feel like a job at all.
So, my house and my heart are open for you guys.
I've sent the address to Sri. See you guys tonight.
And yes, wear something traditional.
You see, it's a Pathan's home.
First impression matters.
Goodbye.
Hello. Welcome.
Let me guess,
Zo told you to do this!
Am I right?
-This is for you. -Thank you so much.
-May I? -Please.
Zorawar!
Zo was right.
You both do look good together.
Come.
What have you--
Zorawar!
If I see you, I'll say
Hundreds of words with my eyes
My destiny will seek you everywhere
I am not here alone
Every moment with you
Makes my heart skip a beat
Look through my eyes
If you want to look at yourself
Look through my eyes
If you want to look at yourself
Let me introduce you to yourself
With your permission
Let me introduce you to yourself
With your permission
Whether you love me or not
Always love yourself
Let me introduce you to yourself
With your permission
Let me introduce you to yourself
With your permission
If I see you, I'll say
Hundreds of words with my eyes
My destiny will seek you everywhere
I am not here alone
Every moment with you
Makes my heart skip a beat
I'll write the beginning
If you write the end
Blame me
For falling in love with you
Blame me
For falling in love with you
Blame me
For falling in love with you
Let my eyes cross with yours
Be what the consequences be
Let my eyes cross with yours
Be what the consequences be
Let me introduce you to yourself

With your permission
If I see you, I'll say
Hundreds of words with my eyes
My destiny will seek you everywhere
I am not here alone
Every moment with you
Makes my heart skip a beat
No, but it was a love story nevertheless.
Even today, I know Zo's father more than anyone else.
He loves to travel the world.
He loves Zo.
He's just not cut out for institutional relationships, that's all.
But that's him.
And this is me.
I am still hot.
Love is unexpected, right?
It can knock on your door at any time.
I see.
So, this is where your dearest son learns all his tricks.
I guess.
Dearest son?
She's picked up quite a lot of Urdu in a single meeting, Mom.
Zorawar…
Or Zo, Za, Zu… whatever you like.
Okay, so you girls, tell me.
By God, you two are so beautiful.
You two must have some story as well.
Auntie… sorry to interrupt you.
If you don't mind, can I use this to make it?
Sri!
No, be my guest, darling.
Thank you, Auntie.
It's a call from India.
It's not Mom.
-I'll have to take this. -Sure.
Hello. Who is this?
Am I speaking with Rajshri Trivedi?
Yes… I mean Rajshri speaking.
Ms. Rajshri, you personally told me
about my company's wrong guidelines and requirements.
But after watching your video, I didn't understand
whether I should offer you a sports show or a dance show!
Sir, you?!
But why are you calling me now?
I've been broadcasting live sports for 16 years, Rajshri.
My channel has done several things before others.
Sometimes, we take time to get updated.
But after watching your interview with Kapil Dev,
I realized it's time to update.
To be honest, I want you to host my next cricket show
and give me a chance to rectify my mistake.
Okay, sir, but…
where did you watch that video?
Guys!
Guys, open your Twicker quickly.
What happened? All okay?
-Yes, I-- -What's on Twicker, sister?
-That video-- Show me! -Hey!
What happened? Which video?
But looking at your passion-- I've done so many interviews, but…
Oh my God, who posted this?
I don't know…
Oh my God! It's trending, guys!
Amazing shit!
Guys, I just got a call from Atul Chabra…
What?
…and he offered me a job.
Sister, you're so sly.
But we sent your strip video to Atul Chabra.
Who uploaded this?
I don't know.
The original upload is by some Srileaks.
Srileaks.
Sometimes, when someone's tired,
just a gentle push.
I told you… love is unexpected.
It can knock on your door at any time.
Let me introduce you to yourself
With your permission
Let me introduce you to yourself
With your permission
INTERNATIONAL ARRIVALS
Brother!
Hey!
-Hi! -Hi!
How was it?
Couldn't have been better.
-Lovely. -I have so much to tell you! Let's go!
-Come on! -I got it!
-Why did you two come to pick me up? -Come on!
How could we let you come alone at this hour?
-The train arrived at 8:00 p.m., Mom. -Okay.
Listen, how about some tea?
Of course.
I got everything in London except for your cup of tea.
Oh, really?
Naughty girl! Always has a way with words!
-Grandma! -Hey!
Grandma!
-You took so long. -I missed you.
Gappu, I'm making tea.
I'll also get the sweets Mr. Sharma got for us.
Mr. Sharma who?
Remember I told you?
It's Yogesh Sharma.
You know what? Yogesh is an engineer.
And they have two homes in Lucknow.
They are coming over on the 20th to introduce you two to each other.
But I won't be here on the 20th, Mom.
I'll be in Delhi.
Then, someplace else,
and then God knows where!
What?!
What did you say?
What do you mean?
I mean…
you lost the bet, Mom.
Yes, but I guess you won over your worries.
Since my childhood…
you tried to hide your Gappu's obesity considering it her weakness.
You fought with everyone, and shielded me.
And silly me thought it was your resentment,
and kept fighting with you.
But let me tell you,
while fighting with you,
your Gappu has learned
to fend against the world.
And now, the time to hide is over.
It's time to show the world.
To express.
About your plus-size daughter Rajshri Trivedi
and her plus-size mother.
I'm going to sign a contract worth 2.5 million.
To host the biggest cricket show in India.
And do you know why I got this contract?
Because of you.
So, if you're making tea,
make some parathas as well.
Would you like some parathas, Granny?
Anytime.
Even I'll have one today.
Saira…
I don't know whether this idea will stick or not.
But if it does,
it will set the stage on fire.
This is just the beginning, brother.
And whether I set the stage on fire or not, maybe later or maybe never,
but this is the definition of Saira Khanna Designs,
and it always will be.
Hello! What's wrong with you?
Where did you get this confidence?
It was always in me.
But whenever I stood in front of the mirror, I saw otherwise.
And this is not the idea.
I'll show the real idea after 15 days…
during the funder's fashion show.
Mona for Tara! Where is she? I mean, come on!
Why don't you guys have an update on this?
I need to know if the showstopper is ready!
What is going on?
Where the hell is Saira?
Saira is here, baby.
Breathe.
I would've gotten a stroke.
Is this my first show or yours?
Relax, will you?
Is my showstopper ready?
Waiting for you in the wings.
Come on.
My vibrant heart
Wants to do the impossible
My vibrant heart
Wants to achieve its dreams
Defends them against the world
Silly thing knows no fear Doesn't understand boundaries
Set off to steal fire from the sun
Crazy thing is pretty stubborn
My vibrant heart
Wants to achieve its dreams
Defends them against the world
All the dreams That were buried in my heart
Have finally been set free Made her fearless
No desire to fend against the world Or defeat anyone
As I've won the battle against myself
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the talented artist,
who has redefined "one size fits all" with her creations.
Please put your hands together for the wonderful Saira Khanna
and her stunning showstopper for the evening!
My vibrant heart
Wants to reach for the stars
To light up itself
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you so much.
I've been fashionable since I was a kid.
As I grew older, I learned
that you have to change yourself for fashion's sake.
You have to be someone else.
And why wouldn't I think this way?
The doll I played with was also slim.
The cartoon princess I followed was also slim.
So, I started to believe that…
to look gorgeous or to be someone,
one has to fit a size.
I'm sure…
my showstopper and my friend,
Rajshri Trivedi, must have also heard the same things.
But now, Rajshri Trivedi
hosts the biggest cricket show on India's biggest sports network.
That too live.
There are people in the audience…
who have the fate of Saira Khanna Designs in their hands.
I just want to say…
if you decide to launch Saira Khanna Designs,
then know this…
I don't want to launch a label…
where the women are hesitant to enter my store.
Or feel, even for a moment,
that there's something inside the store
that won't fit their coolness, budget, or size.
I want to make clothes that are sized to your attitude.
My vibrant heart
Wants to reach for the stars
To light up itself
My vibrant heart
Doesn't listen to me
-Saira! -Yeah?
I'll be right back.
Is that her?
-I don't know, bro. -Take a look.
Why would she be here?
She does cricket commentary, bro.
Yeah, that's her.
-Is it her? -Yes.
By the way, even Saira Khanna is pretty hot, bro.
Yeah, bro.
Behave! Bloody flippant!
She is my girlfriend.
Sorry. Really sorry, sir.
It's all right.
-Let's go. -Yes.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
I am not.
Don't worry.
-Even you-- -Zo!
See, she called me Zo!
All set.
My room is cleared out.
What will you do with it?
I'd like to put in a treadmill.
Great idea. Your mom wants to keep it as is,
while she waits for your life to fall apart
so you'll come back and she'll look after you forever.
-That's not true. -That's creepy.
Tell me about it.
All right. I'll put this in the van.
Look, I'm smiling.
Anna.
Loredana, hi.
In two weeks, you'll enjoy having them out of your hair.
I know how you feel.
When Maya and Pietro left, it was such an emotional moment.
Intimate.
Intimate, indeed.
A family-only moment.
-Okay, we're done. -Yeah.
Please come back home,
at least to watch soccer games with Dad.
I mean, don't make me watch them.
Sure, Mom.
Not to meddle,
but why move to the city when it's so lovely here?
She has a point.
BASED ON "MES TRÈS CHERS ENFANTS" -Bye. -Bye.
Bye.
Bye, Mom.
Go on.
I'm making lasagna tomorrow. Come for lunch.
Just kidding.
-I was kidding. -Come on.
CAR AND VAN RENTALS THROUGHOUT ITALY
15 MONTHS LATER
Emilio and Alessandra only call when they need something.
They don't even show up for a funeral.
She's just an old lady they saw no more than three times.
She was still a relative, Mom.
-Be strong. -Carlo.
-Bye. -I am so sorry.
And it was totally unexpected.
She drank like a fish for 90 years. It's no wonder she croaked.
How's Alessandra? Haven't seen her in ages.
She's fine.
Sadly, she couldn't come. She had… a job interview.
-A job interview? Great. What for? -Yeah.
Well…
-She didn't say. She's superstitious. -Heroin dealer.
What about Emilio?
He had to attend a more important funeral.
He couldn't make it. Shall we go?
I'm coming, Mom.
They keep changing her drug dosages.
She's on an emotional roller coaster.
-All right. Bye, Anna. -Bye.
-Bye, dear. -How pretty you are.
-You're right. -Hold on to her.
Bye.
Hold on a second, please.
-Are you there? -Yes, Mom.
Great.
Listen, Dad and I can't wait to see you
and be together.
Me too.
Guess what I'm going to make?
Stuffed guinea fowl.
I'm vegan. Don't you remember?
Come on, sweetie, it's your birthday.
All right. See you tomorrow, then.
Ale, one more thing.
I saw your WhatsApp profile picture.
It looks like an ad for a Colombian brothel.
What?
I mean, it's beautiful, as you are.
But what's the point?
The point of what?
Posing half-naked in the mirror with your mouth…
Your lips look like they're being sucked by a vacuum.
See you tomorrow.
What time are you coming?
1:30?
Why not noon?
We'll spend some time together. You'll give me a hand.
-Fine. See you tomorrow. -Bye, honey.
-Bye, Mom. -Hey, honey, wait…
Emi, honey, there's been a change of plan.
Your sister wants to come at noon.
So I think you should do the same.
We'll spend time together. It's gonna be a fun birthday.
I can't wait, sweetie. I'm counting on you.
Bye, honey.
THE RESISTANCE
It's gonna be great…
Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday, honey. -Happy birthday.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
THE TRUE ITALIAN ESPRESSO
All right. I'll clear the table.
I'm not gonna skip the meal because you're pissed off.
I'm calm.
Come on. Maybe they forgot.
-Or they're just late. -Stop talking bullshit.
They're kids. They're supposed to break away from their parents.
And in this specific case,
they probably can't stand you guys.
Thanks, Mom.
Stop calling her, please. It's humiliating.
Don't be a child!
I made the cake. I'll do what I want with it.
-What if they come? -They won't.
They can eat it from the dumpster like wild boars.
-Hi. -Hi.
-I'm waiting for Maya. -That's nice.
-Your kids aren't coming for lunch? -Huh?
I thought today was Alessandra's birthday.
Right. Good memory.
She's not coming to celebrate?
No. She doesn't want me to work too hard in the kitchen.
She'll take us out somewhere as a surprise.
Nice.
Coming home to eat all the time is such a drag. I mean, what a pain.
We like it, though.
Did your people learn to honk before they could walk?
Hi, honey.
Maya is pregnant again.
No.
She isn't?
She looks like it.
Bye.
Where are we meeting Emilio?
At a bar near his office.
We'll have a quick aperitif because he has dinner afterwards.
Since we're near Alessandra's,
we should ask her to join us.
-Fat chance. -We can still try.
All right.
Look, there she is.
So she does smoke. What a liar. She told me she quit.
-Did you see the face she made? -What face?
A what-does-this-pain-in-the-ass-want face.
-What are you talking about? -No?
Come on.
Look.
See that face?
Hello, Mom. Tell me quick. I'm working.
Are you smoking?
No.
No, I'm not smoking.
What's wrong, Mom?
Well, we came to have an aperitif with your brother.
Yeah, but I'm work… Listen, Mom, I…
I can't come for Christmas lunch.
I completely forgot to tell you.
-What? -What do you mean?
I'm going to Paris with Rocco. Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Hello? Mom?
Mom?
Shall we go?
-But we're here. Let's say hi. -Let's go.
Let's go.
You know what makes me happy this Christmas?
-No. -Hope.
I hope Rocco will dump our daughter,
and she'll come crawling back to be consoled.
"Crawling"? That's very Christmassy.
And when she tries to come in,
with a smile on your face, you'll tell her, "I'm so sorry, sweetie."
"Mom and I are not a towel that you wipe your ass with."
Or maybe you can tell her that.
Hey, there.
-Hi, honey. -Hi.
Here I am.
-Here are the ironed ones. -Thank you.
Careful. Don't wrinkle them.
Take my dirty shirts. It'd be perfect if you could wash them by Wednesday.
Sure.
Dry cleaners do exist, you know.
I can't with my salary.
Whining to Mommy and Daddy?
No. He's Azeglio, my boss.
-My parents. -Hello.
-Hello, I'm Anna. -Right.
Nice to meet you. Kudos on your son.
Thank you.
Kudos, as you must be such good people
not to give him up for adoption.
Am I right?
Just kidding.
Don't drink. We have a conference call in an hour.
Tonight?
No. By "in an hour,"
I mean in an hour tomorrow.
Okay, then.
Okay, what? Of course it's tonight. Wake the fuck up. Come on.
-Let's go. Have a nice evening. -Bye.
-Tomorrow… -Bye.
Don't worry, Mom. I'm used to it.
Him? No.
-I'm not worried about him. -Who then?
Your sister.
What happened?
She's going to Paris for Christmas.
What a bitch.
I wouldn't use that word. But you're right.
And now what?
What do you mean?
She won't be there for Christmas.
And I was also invited somewhere, so…
-What? Who… -I'll go. See you later.
But I'll be there with Mom and Grandma. You know--
Right!
Why don't we have a nice Christmas dinner on January 3rd or 4th?
Where are you going now?
Didn't you hear? I have the call. I'll take my shirts.
Okay.
Bye, Mom.
-Bye, Dad. -Bye.
Hold on…
Christmas is called off?
We'll have a nice dinner on January 3rd.
-So what? -Christmas dinner on January 3rd?
After Christmas, lamb goes on sale.
After Christmas, lamb goes on sale. They practically give it away.
Oh, come on.
-Damn, you suck. -Please.
Look who's talking, walking around like a clown in that sweater.
I gave it to him.
My dad got it in Lapland.
Well, okay. It would fit perfectly in Lapland.
It's actually festive.
How's your dad?
Fine. He and his new girlfriend travel a lot.
What about Carlo and Anna?
Dunno. They're upset I'm not going home for Christmas.
Haven't heard from them in a week. Never happened.
How are they?
I haven't heard from them either.
Really?
Come on, guys. It's not a big deal.
It is when it comes to them.
This has never happened before. It's odd.
Right?
Yeah. I won't be there for Christmas either.
How come?
I have plans too…
No dice.
-Neither of them is answering. -Call Grandma.
-Yes? -Hello?
Grandma, it's Ale. Were you sleeping? Did I bother you?
No, I wasn't.
And you are bothering me. What?
Well…
-I'm here with Emilio and… -Who gives a shit.
Grandma, hi. We were wondering, what's up with Mom and Dad?
They're not answering our calls. Do you know if they're okay?
More than okay. How would you feel in their place?
Old and bored?
Don't be an idiot.
I'm sure they're not bored after what happened.
Why? What happened?
That's weird.
They didn't tell you?
Aunt Tea's inheritance.
Your mom was so kind to her. She really deserved it.
-Who the fuck is Aunt Tea? -What did they get?
I don't know how much, but a lot.
Bye, sweetie.
Bye.
The old fart from Ceccano.
Huh?
PROMETHEUS
Nope, they're not answering.
Neither phone calls nor messages. Nothing.
-Who? -My parents.
They're usually like leeches, but now…
Are your folks also clinging as if you were ten?
My parents died when I was 12.
I miss them terribly.
I'm sorry.
Keep calling them…
while they're still alive.
You really worked on it all night?
Till 6:00 a.m.
You must have fallen asleep around 2:30 a.m.
and had a nightmare where you were an asshole.
Then you suddenly woke up and your nightmare is here, down on paper.
Am I right?
Do it again by tomorrow. Will you wake the fuck up?
-I can't take much more of this. -Yeah.
If I were ever put in the Emilio zone, I'd cut and run too.
-There are limits. -What's the Emilio zone?
It's just… something Marzio came up with.
It's…
Yeah, I get it.
You bastard!
What?
What you said?
"Let's go tomorrow. I'm working tonight."
I got off earlier. What about you?
Because my brother is an asshole.
Cut it out.
Move.
Please let's not mention the inheritance thing.
-Let them tell us. -Why?
'Cause they'll think we're here for that.
-Hi. -Hi.
What a surprise.
You haven't been picking up.
We came to see you.
-You vanished. -Nonsense.
-Hi. -Mom.
-What were you guys doing? -I was preparing dinner.
Do you want to stay?
-Sure, if you don't mind. -Of course not.
I happen to have some wine with me.
Was it easy to get here?
-What do you mean? -You remembered the address?
-Very funny. -She said… okay.
I'm sorry, though.
I wasn't prepared, and I only have this.
Are you kidding? That's plenty.
-Don't worry. -Not really.
It looks so good. What is it?
It's an offal pie.
It's filled with chunks of heart, liver, tripe,
along with the comb and wattle. Would you like some?
Yes, sure.
You're no longer vegan?
Yes, but on special occasions…
-For your brother. -Sure.
Taste this wine. The guy at the wine shop
said it won Bottle of the Year in Abruzzo.
-Seriously? -Try it.
How is it?
It's shit.
Kidding. It's good, full-bodied.
Full-bodied…
-Thanks. -How are things with Rocco?
Fine, as usual.
Are you gonna add anything to your life to make things less usual?
You know Alessandra hates talking about such things.
No, Dad.
I don't mind. I want to discuss these things with you.
Although… having kids is expensive nowadays.
Very expensive.
-Emilio, what are you up to? -Me?
I work all the time.
Not that I enjoy it.
But someone has to pay the rent.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
It doesn't.
How about you?
Fine. We're fine.
All good.
I'm not going to Paris.
My Christmas trip was canceled.
I'll be with you.
-Great! -Really?
-Me too. -Really?
You too?
Not because of a cancellation.
I decided to spend Christmas with you.
I may be immature,
but I can't cut the umbilical cord with Mom.
The umbilical cord…
That's so… creepy, you know? It's…
Shut up and eat your comb.
-The offal is indigestible. -Thanks.
-It made me sleepy. -It was delicious.
-It was a great evening. Thank you. -Bye.
-Good night. Bye. -Thank you again.
-Talk to you tomorrow. -Yes.
-All right. -Okay.
-Bye. Come on, it's cold. -Bye.
-Bye. -Oh, I was wondering.
How was Aunt Tea's funeral? So sorry I couldn't go.
It was so moving. All her relatives were there except you guys.
When I found out, I got this pain in my chest,
and I just couldn't make it.
Me too. Even if we didn't see her much,
I really loved her.
Yes, I was also very close to Aunt Tea.
We forgot to tell you.
She left us a little inheritance.
Little? Huge.
-Is that so? -How much?
-Six million. -Six million. Six…
Well, not bad.
There's worse.
Six million is a lot of money to spend. It takes effort…
It is indeed. We might donate it.
Aunt Tea was so generous.
She'd be happy if we gave it to the needy.
I'm needy.
-There's no rush. -Just kidding.
-It's safe in the bank for now. -All right. Bye, kids.
Bye. I'm getting cold.
-Maybe see you tomorrow-- -Bye.
See?
-Enough! -Shut up!
To six million.
Not bad, huh?
Do you realize I can say goodbye to this shitty life?
Your life with me?
No, baby, it's not about you. I mean my job.
You work with me.
Yes, but now I can figure out
what I really want to do with my life.
Not worrying about money.
You're right.
Maybe you should do it regardless of the money.
The money belongs to your parents.
What a drag!
Why are you such a pain in the ass?
You could have just said,
"Six million! Wow, let's fuck!"
No.
-Will it still count now? -No.
Another round!
Emilio!
Marzio, no! Marzio pays for himself!
Marzio pays for himself!
Pay up. You see this, Marzio?
This is the new Emilio zone, and you are banned!
A toast to Aunt Tea!
To Aunt Tea!
Aunt Tea!
They don't want to be around us.
Since when?
I didn't notice while it was happening.
We used to do so many things together.
Do you remember Greece? The four of us in a tent…
You and I can also do things together.
Like what?
Undressed, lying down…
A CAT scan?
So demeaning.
Look, Carlo, I'm not in the mood to celebrate anything.
Last time we did it was a year ago,
on All Souls' Day.
Just a year?
My performance was remarkable. Turgid and never-ending.
Anyway, you were right.
About what?
That they'd show up because of the money.
Imagine when we tell them we made it up.
They'll be gone for good.
-So be it. They're assholes. -I know. You're right.
But we'll spend Christmas together.
Yes. One last Christmas, the four of us together.
A message from Emilio.
"Mom, Dad, I love you."
-Honey, you know-- -They're assholes.
But… it still feels nice, you know?
How can we make them think we're millionaires?
-Don't worry. I have a plan. -What plan?
You'll see.
-This one? -Maybe this one.
-This is flashy. -What about this one?
-Well? -Beautiful.
How much is it?
Goodness.
Not bad!
-Can I get in? -Sure.
How does it feel?
You'll need a water pump to get me out of here. But it's divine.
How long do you want to rent it?
Until Christmas.
Okay.
What about insurance?
If you mess it up, I'll feed your balls to the dog.
Said the marquis to the count.
That's a high deductible.
You're supposed to be in Amsterdam from Thursday to Monday.
Fine. No problem.
Yes? Good. Come in.
-No problem at all. -Here?
Thank you.
-How are things? -What things?
How are you?
I'm fine, thanks.
I noticed you've been changing for the better lately.
It was hard to do worse…
I take partial credit for this.
If it hadn't been for my daily injections of frustration,
you wouldn't have improved, right?
I don't know.
I do know. That's not the point.
Now that you've finally blossomed,
I can offer you a position as…
partner.
What do you think?
-Are you serious? -I am.
No more dicking you around.
From now on,
we dick around with the others, if you want.
Am I right?
Why not?
Obviously, you'll have to invest a small sum
to enter as a partner as I did when I joined.
Right.
Because I know…
I mean, I heard…
Rumor has it you have the means now.
-So… -I get it.
But it's not my money. It's my father's.
He's a very restrained person, to say the least.
The kind of person who puts money under his mattress.
Guess he pulled something out from under his mattress.
Jeez.
Holy shit.
Come on down!
I can't believe it!
Believe it.
Is it yours?
-Let me try. -Hell, no.
-One joyride! -Okay, get in. I'll drive.
Look at that.
Don't hump my Ferrari!
Stop being an oaf.
Everybody's watching. We're making assholes of ourselves.
-Don't touch. You'll ruin it. It's new. -Ruin it?
Yeah.
Would you call back at 3:00?
Okay? Good.
Thank you so much.
I told you already. You can only have one lollipop.
That's your third.
Oh my God, Mom.
-What are you wearing? -It's snakeskin.
It's super soft. Touch it.
No. I can imagine.
€4,000.
I saw an ad for an apartment for sale.
It's mind-blowing.
Have you decided to invest?
No.
It'd be more like a gift.
You'd love it.
You want to come with me?
Yes, sure. Gladly.
I mean… you guys can handle things.
You guys?
I mean you.
Do you expect me to do fillings from the front desk?
Yes, great idea. Bye.
Bye.
My boss invited me to play golf next Saturday.
He'd like you to come as well.
He barely knows me.
It's a chance to get to know you.
-I don't know how to play though. -No worries.
We'll just walk around the grass and hang out.
Like so.
Listen.
Take this check.
Put it in the glove compartment. I don't want to carry it.
It's for the World Wildlife Fund.
Mom and I are trying to save an island where six kanaroos live.
What are kanaroos?
"What are kanaroos?"
An endangered species of seal living in the Galápagos.
-€70,000 for kanaroos? -Yes, 70,000.
That's so heartbreaking.
Mom's gone on a charity kick.
She's an angel.
-What's wrong? -The car is rebelling.
And this is the terrace, spacious and quiet.
Our gardeners took care of the grounds before.
Just give us a call and they'll be happy to come.
-It's gorgeous. -It is.
How many people would live here?
Well, two…
maybe three.
Four, five?
Excuse me.
Hello?
-Do you like it? -It's beautiful.
It's really lovely. And huge.
Can you imagine living here?
Listen, I wanted to tell you that I quit smoking.
I'm so glad to hear that. Good.
But most of all,
I stopped taking the pill.
-You did? -Yes.
Honey.
-Since when? -Today.
I decided that I'll focus on doing things right.
Yeah.
Look.
Wow.
This will be useful for physiotherapy.
We'll put handrails in, otherwise the elderly will get hurt.
-What elderly? -The ones that will come to live here.
Yes. I'm taking over the initiative Aunt Tea had
with this organization.
They give free housing to needy old people.
Lonely people neglected by their family.
Really, Mom?
You can't imagine how many asshole kids abandon their parents.
That's so sad.
PIERO'S TRATTORIA
You should've seen her face
when I said the pool was for the elderly.
You guys are monsters.
Us? They're the monsters, Mom.
They've been treating her like shit for years.
Both of us.
But you're the one who's upset.
It's Alessandra.
Honey? Hi.
I'm in the oratory with Father Ciro.
I'm giving him a check for his mission in Nigeria.
Sure, where? Shedo?
Of course, yes.
If it has no Michelin star, I won't even sit, you know?
See you tomorrow.
Bye.
"With no Michelin star I don't sit." So tacky.
You've gone too far.
Revenge is like getting drunk.
Once you decide to stop, you can't.
That's because getting drunk feels so good, Mom.
Cheers.
Hi, Lori.
-Hi. -Hi.
I'm going downtown to eat with Ale.
It sounds good.
And Carlo is playing golf with Emilio.
I'm going to swing some sticks around, as they say in golf lingo.
They've come around more often lately.
They're like leeches.
But we're having fun.
We're going to the city. Having the usual lunch at home
was becoming a little boring.
But then, of course,
some people like it. Of course…
Yeah…
You're doing the limbo?
I told him to get an SUV!
If I have to lay down, I'd rather stay home on the couch.
But men turn into children when it comes to cars.
Vincenzo's not fond of cars. He couldn't care less.
Good thing. With your Polish minivan,
he'd have killed himself.
Honey, you're becoming a boor.
Bye.
-Here is your table. -Thank you.
Would you care for a drink?
Yes.
Dom Pérignon for two, s'il vous plaît.
Why not.
Let's celebrate.
What's wrong?
It's been a long time since we did something together.
The two of us.
Nonsense.
It's true.
I promise we'll do it more often.
I hope so.
What's wrong?
Huh?
Sometimes you look like a pigeon. A dumb pigeon
who wants to say something but can't.
-A pigeon? -He's here.
Dad! We're here.
Let me handle it. I'll fool him.
-That's my dad we're talking about. -I know.
I mean in a good way. He'll make good money.
Anyway, I said I'll fool him, not screw him.
I hope not.
-Hello. Sorry I'm late. -Hello.
-No worries. -You remember my boss?
No bosses. Azeglio de Frescobaldi.
-A pleasure. -Call me de Frescobaldi.
Carlo Delle Fave. Call me Delle Fave.
You laugh? You're a Delle Fave too. It's nice here.
-You like it? -Yes.
Millet tacos with celeriac purée.
Asparagus from Cantello.
Cantello.
Marinated pumpkin tartar with garlic cuts and pink grapefruit.
Beetroot crackers with cucumber mousse.
Glasswort salad with raspberry cream.
Smoked potato spaghetti.
Cherry tomato pesto.
Marjoram pesto, tarte tatin. Dessert Pop.
New York-style. An homage to Andy Warhol.
Here you go.
-Did you enjoy it? -We did, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
What can I say?
Thanks.
-Thank you. -No.
I'm the one thanking you.
We can do it again, if you want.
Any time.
Plus, we don't go out to eat that often,
so we may as well live it up and spare no expense.
I'm going to the restroom.
I don't want to see how much you'll pay.
I might faint.
Thank you, honey.
-What a great shot. Fantastic. -Bravo!
-Are you surprised? -Bravo!
Emilio told me you received a nice…
and unexpected gift from life.
From death, rather.
Right. Same thing, though.
Life or death, someone has to cough up the dough.
Anyway, we can discuss it later.
Because I think if that gift is left there unopened,
it's as useless as a limp dick.
Am I right?
You're a poet.
Take your shot.
Thanks. I'm not good at it.
You are. It's easy. I'll show you.
He's a real dickhead.
Excuse me.
-Excuse me. -Yes?
Listen.
By any chance, may I pay with meal vouchers?
No.
Of course not.
I would've needed 300 of them, so…
All right. I'll pay by check.
-Relax. -I'm relaxed.
Relax your legs.
-Move your pelvis a bit more. -I heard you! Why won't he let go of me?
Like I said, about that gift,
if it's a pre-death donation,
tax conditions are much better.
Parent-children relationships are also better pre-death.
God, did I hurt you?
Huh?
Look.
You clobbered me.
Come on. I'm almost done.
Next week, I'll put in the temporary implants.
And then the permanent ones.
We need to talk to Mom and Dad.
What?
We need to talk to Mom and Dad.
They're squandering everything.
The Ferrari, the fucking charity. We'll have nothing left.
It's still their money, isn't it?
Yes, but it's six million.
Not even one euro for their needy kids?
Do you know what I can do with two million?
Why two million?
Two for me, two for Emilio, and two for them.
A couple counts as one.
Wait.
-It's Mom. -Pick up.
I am already.
-Hello? -Hi. How's Emilio?
-Like shit. -He's in pain.
He's very shaken too.
Dad feels so guilty.
Rightfully. He already struggled to socialize before, poor thing.
-Let alone now, without teeth. -What the fuck?
Listen, Dad and I want to see you both.
How about lunch at Piero's on Sunday?
We need to talk about the inheritance and everything.
Okay.
See you on Sunday then.
-Love you. -Me too.
-I love you more. -Bye.
Bye.
-Finally. -Yeah.
I'm returning the car after lunch.
Maybe I'll let Emilio drive.
It'll sugarcoat it.
We should've waited till Christmas.
Emilio's boss was on my back for money the other day.
I didn't know what do to. I can't handle it anymore.
How do we tell them?
Plain and simple.
"Nothing is true. It was a prank." We didn't kill anyone.
We need to have a serious talk, as a family.
They can't still treat us as a doormat.
"Pay for this! Wash this! You're old!"
Yeah.
They're here.
You smashed his face.
Oh, please. It's barely noticeable.
-Hi. -Honey.
Your teeth?
Rocco'll put in temporary implants in two days.
-I'm so sorry. -It's fine.
What the…
This game of golf is a fools' game.
With those iron sticks, if you smack someone in the face, then…
someone gets hurt.
Giulia, we're ready.
Four portions of linguine Piero-style to start, okay?
-Yes. -Perfect.
Thank you.
You talk.
Me? Not you?
You're better at this maternal stuff.
Hell, no.
Wow.
There's already an air of celebration.
Yes, just a little gift. It's a foretaste of Christmas.
-Smells good. -Suspense.
The same amount for you both so no one gets jealous.
The ATM gave us different bills, but the sum is the same.
€150?
Well, kids…
We played a prank on you.
That's why.
These days we were saying, "Damn, they're stingy."
"All for themselves."
Okay.
All joking aside for a moment,
I want to open an account with my share. Sound good?
Maybe we weren't clear.
We can only give you…
this.
What?
Let's go.
Why?
If I stay longer, I'll get pissed off.
Hey! Watch it!
-For real? €150? Keep it. -How pathetic.
You are pathetic.
You're being stinking skinflints with your own kids.
The kids who only show up for money?
Enough with moral blackmail! You could've helped us out.
We've always done everything for you.
Let's go.
They can live like billionaires alone.
Better alone than with two dickheads like you.
I'll break his molars too.
We gave them everything.
Diapers, vacations, university.
After all our sacrifices, they dare to call me stingy.
We can't blame them. They think we inherited six million.
Is the money theirs?
No, but we could've given them more than €150 for Christmas.
-You think? -Yes, you are a bit stingy.
Stingy? I'm just frugal. I'm not stingy.
Emilio gets €2,000 per month,
more than my pension. She makes €1,000 by doing nothing.
Christmas without those two will be a relief.
Listen.
Carlo, don't say it, even in jest.
What a great idea you had. You made a mess.
Me? I did it for you. You kept obsessing over them.
Couldn't you let it be instead of playing the victim?
All this for this cursed Christmas that haunts me!
Here's what we'll do.
I'll talk to Emilio, and you'll talk to Alessandra.
We'll explain things calmly. They'll understand.
I don't want a Christmas without them.
Man, what a pain in the ass.
-I made him pay. Was I wrong? -No.
It was his fault. He pays up. Am I right?
Thanks.
Ezio, since all your colleagues hate you, you wanna pay?
Maybe they'll like you more.
Okay.
Am I right?
-Say thanks to Ezio. -Thanks, Ezio.
Thanks, Ezio.
Why are you here? I was going back to work.
Rocco fixed your teeth?
Too bad. You were cute talking like a hamster.
What do you want?
Nothing. I wanted to say hi and make peace with you.
Want to drive?
-Don't throw me a bone. -Come on, let's have a chat.
I have something to confess.
Delle Fave. Hi.
-All good? -Yes. You vanished.
It's a hard time, I have many things to solve.
Right. You could've told me.
I made you and Emilio a nice offer.
I expected at least a yes or a no. Just this…
You're right.
But expecting anything from Emilio is fucking stupid.
Am I right?
Honey?
Will you open up?
I don't want to see anyone.
I have something to tell you.
I brought you a gift. I don't want any gifts.
Are you going away?
No, I'm moving out.
What's happening?
What's happening is that I'm a loser.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am, Mom.
Cut it out, honey.
Will you help me?
Try to sit on it.
Ale.
Rocco no longer loves me.
In fact, now he despises me because I argued with you.
It looks like you all ganged up
to make me feel that I don't deserve anything.
What's so important?
Huh?
You came because you had something to tell me.
-Goodness. -Honey.
-Hi. -How did it go?
All set.
How did he take it?
Well, we talked, and we found common ground.
We're all to blame in this mess, you know?
-Right. -He's the first to admit it.
I didn't tell him the inheritance is a crock of shit though.
What?
We discussed our relationship, which matters most.
Sure, right.
I'll give him €200,000 to be a partner.
-Are you nuts? -What?
How will you get €200,000?
Fuck if I know!
Did you manage to tell Alessandra?
-Yes… -Hi, Dad.
-Hi. -Is dinner ready?
Almost.
We decided I'll stay here with you for a while.
-Happy? -Yes.
So I can help you understand what to do with all this money.
This whole being a millionaire thing is stressful for Mom.
She needs us.
Support her. It's too much money. She's so stressed out.
Make sure you don't trumpet the inheritance thing.
Why?
Because when it comes to money, people become sticky.
Especially relatives.
-Hello. Here we are. -Hello.
Hello.
-You look so pretty. -No.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I'll make a toast.
-What a drag! -Exactly.
I had prepared a very touching speech.
But given your notorious sentimentalism,
I thought you'd get too emotional.
So I put it aside.
All I'll say is,
Mom, I love you.
-Happy birthday, Giuliana. -Thank you!
-Thank you, honey. -Happy birthday.
-Anna? -Matteo, tell me.
I guess you saved your touching, heartfelt words
for my mother only.
What? We all loved her.
What…?
She only left me peanuts.
You're driving a Ferrari.
Drop it, honey.
Where did she get all that money, by the way?
At least tell me this, Anna.
It must have been Bisacci.
You were against their relationship.
Nonsense! Mom had no relationship.
You didn't even appear in the will.
How did you do it?
Tell me, how?
Did you make her write a private agreement on her deathbed?
Carlo.
I can't find my napkin.
It's not what you think, Matteo.
It's not? Then what is it?
Anna sent her husband to her. She put her husband on her.
First, Bisacci.
And then Carlo.
Carlo was fucking her too.
Are you out of your mind? Bisacci? Who the fuck is Bisacci?
-Where is the money? -Matteo.
Matteo!
-No! -Are you the Gestapo?
Slowly.
-Over there, okay? -Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
-Easy. -Easy.
If I ever have a family,
I doubt I'll be able to do all you've done for us.
When you become a father, it will come naturally.
I'm not so sure.
I probably wouldn't have slept with Aunt Tea for six million.
Don't you start too! Jeez.
Honey, how do you feel?
-Like a human wreck. -Don't play the victim. Come on.
Trimming the tree?
It's snowing.
Wow! It hasn't snowed in ages.
-Snow? Shit, I came by moped. -Yes.
So what? You can stay over.
We'll trim the tree together.
I'll make hot chocolate. The one with flour.
Why not?
-What? -I'm happy.
Look at this.
She'd look great in this jacket.
How much is it?
Please stop talking about money.
We can't keep this act up.
We can no longer afford it.
You know already. It's until Christmas.
At this rate, we'll have to sell our organs to get to Christmas.
Stop being a buzzkill.
I asked until Christmas. Is it too much? Tell me!
You scare me.
Look at that.
Let's give them two IOUs for a Caribbean trip this summer.
It's easy to make IOUs.
It's a Versace. Shall I get this too?
So she will have two.
Does Versace take IOUs?
Take this one. It's not ironed. Maybe it costs less.
-What comes after five stars? -Bankruptcy.
Paradise.
-Hi. -How nice.
-How are you guys? Fine? -Fine.
I made up with Rocco.
-I'm happy for you. -He's a good guy.
We're not together, though.
We just made up.
Because I realized I want to find my path,
figure out my dreams and ambitions.
What ambitions?
Mine.
Oh, I didn't know…
You think I'm an idiot
and only Emilio will succeed.
-Emilio won't succeed either. -Come on.
Whatever.
I want to open a tearoom.
Tearoom and bookstore. I found a spot.
-It's great to see you so enthusiastic. -It is.
And I'll move out of your house.
I don't want to risk resting on my laurels.
-This I understand. -But why?
Where are you going?
Here. I got a suite.
The three of us home are so good together.
I'll stay here for a few days. I'm already looking for a place.
That is, of course, if you guys could help me out.
Give me the checkbook.
I may not have it with me.
-You do. Give it to me. -Not in this jacket.
Give it to me.
-Lucky devil, here it is. -See?
I have a pen too.
How much do you need?
Well… I have to leave a deposit, so…
To buy the suite?
No, for the tearoom.
I don't know. Ten? Twenty?
I know you gave Emilio 200,000, so…
-We just talked about it, but then… -No.
What about 40?
So I won't bother you every month with bank transfers.
It's no bother. In fact, if we defer, we'll see each other more often.
Forty?
-Yes. Forty. -Yes.
All right.
-One zero is missing. -Butt out.
Done.
Thanks.
Careful, it's slippery.
You're wearing flip-flops.
What a pleasure!
I'm so glad you called. How are you?
-So-so. How are you? -I'm fine.
Please follow me. We'll take a seat in the parlor.
We'll talk calmly.
This way, please.
There's a parlor?
For special clients. It's a secret.
-Like the Batcave? -Exactly.
And you are like the Bruce Wayne of Speroncello, right?
Please.
Hold my calls for half an hour.
-What parlor? It's just a room. -All right.
So what can I do for you?
We'd like to cash in our life insurance policy
and move it to our account.
Okay.
And then?
And that's it.
Then we need to empty our account.
Why is that?
Personal matters.
I guess you're switching to a big city bank.
No.
Where you feel more comfortable with your Ferrari.
They don't know you're small-town people,
who come from where the air smells like manure.
-Isn't that so? -Are you out of your mind?
You are spitting on a ten-year relationship of trust.
Relationship?
In Sharm el-Sheikh, we exceeded our credit ceiling.
You fucking refused to raise it.
Relationship?
No, that is a falsehood!
I couldn't even buy henna.
We spent the rest of our vacation
in our room eating bread and falafel.
Bread and falafel… yummy.
Ma'am, there are rules, and the rules must be followed, okay?
No. You give us our money now because, as a billionaire,
I don't want any rules.
And most of all, now I can tell you bank people to fuck off.
Actually, look.
Take this and go buy yourself some class.
Boor.
That's too much.
Excuse her. She's so dramatic.
€200. Is she tipping you?
Take care.
We made asses of ourselves.
WE LOVE YOU… MOM AND DAD
Done.
Now they'll have to forgive us when we tell them the truth.
-You think? -Hell, yes. Jeez.
If I were given €50,000 every time I was pranked,
I'd gladly be a laughingstock forever.
They're here.
I bought the tearoom spot!
-Huh? -I bought the tearoom spot.
I'm going to the notary tomorrow.
Hi.
I got a great deal. 200 square meters near the station.
The guy from the agency had never seen such a deal.
-Wow. See? -€400,000!
Good.
I promise this is the last thing I'll ask of you. I promise.
You can give the rest of my share to charity.
Maybe I'll take it.
-Dad, look. -Yes.
I brought all the papers
so we can proceed with signing the financing.
What great news!
What's wrong?
What, Mom?
Enough. We have to tell you the truth.
Carlo, we have to tell them.
-Yes. -What truth?
We can't give you that money.
Right.
Because…
your father…
Me? You too.
…is very sick.
-Right. -He came down with a bad disease. Awful.
Cancer?
Even worse.
-Holy shit. -It's a rare disease.
They're working on a cure in America.
But it's so expensive.
Very expensive.
So, from now on, we must use our finances…
to save Dad.
Save me.
Hold on. What disease is it? What is it called?
It doesn't have a name. It's just been discovered.
-Just now. -How did you find out?
-I felt… -Yes.
I was feeling strange.
-Dizzy. -Yes, but…
counterclockwise and hiccuping. Palpitations.
Enough. It makes me sick.
Anyway, apart from the trip to America,
we also scheduled medical consultations in Paris and Tokyo.
Hong Kong too. They're experts.
They are.
But don't worry. We'll be back for Christmas.
Two days in Paris and we'll be back to celebrate.
-She'd never miss Christmas. -Yes.
Right, so…
This is all we can do.
For real?
Are you kidding?
We want nothing.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Come here.
-Let's all pray together for Dad. -Let's pray.
Drop dead.
Now what? What's your plan?
If you had a better idea, you could've expressed it.
Better than pretending I'm dead?
I didn't know what to do.
Keep your voice down. They'll hear.
They'll realize I'm not dying.
Not necessarily.
Are you going to kill me over a damn Christmas dinner?
Listen, we can tell them you were cured.
Or the disease remained dormant.
Who's that?
Darlings.
Still awake?
We want to sleep in bed with you.
Like we used to on Christmas Eve.
-Yes, sure. Yes. -We can't fit.
Let's try to be happy, okay?
Even though it may be the last Christmas we spend together.
Here we go again!
Don't say that.
-Ouch! Don't hit me. I have cancer! -What?
-Come on. -Sorry.
Good night.
Son, you need to shower. I'm serious.
-It's really unbearable. -Okay.
Don't pull. Wait.
-Smells like a Calcutta sewer. -Did you settle?
-Not my hand. -All right.
-I feel oppressed. Don't take my hand. -Don't fret. It's bad for you.
I can't sleep like this.
-Give me your hand. -Goodness.
-Unbelievable. -Come on.
You're anxious.
All right. Perfect, thank you.
-Thanks. -Hi.
Hi!
-How are you? -Fine.
How was your day?
-I walked around. -I see. Okay.
-The doctor is free. -Thanks.
-See you later. -Bye.
-Still living with your parents? -No, I'm living at Mara's now.
I thought it was right to leave them alone for a while.
How is Carlo?
He's fine for now, thank God.
But I think he's trying to look strong for us.
He's in Paris for a consultation now.
I'd like to see him.
You know what we can do? We can video call him.
-No, let's not disturb him. -He'd like it.
Plus, I video call him ten times a day.
You're a good excuse. Come close.
-Here they are. Hi. -Hi.
-Hi. -How are you, Rocco?
-Great. Isn't Paris wonderful? -Yes, a little cold.
There's no one around?
Yeah, hardly anyone. How are you and Emilio?
You don't know?
-What? -He got fired.
How come?
Maybe he didn't mention it to not worry you.
He's already looking for another job.
He'll stay with me for a while.
I can't live without a Delle Fave around.
Let's call him!
Mom, don't worry. We're fine.
Enjoy Paris.
It's so good to see you there so happy.
Come on, honey. Don't cry.
Call him, please. Let's have a family call.
Okay. I'll add him.
-Done. Hi. -Hi.
-Hi. -You're all there.
-How's it going? -Fine. I was thinking about you.
Where are you?
Going home to pick up some shirts.
Oh…
Great. Well, listen, we need to go.
No, Dad, wait.
-How did it go with Dr. Roland? -Great!
He said I'm healthy.
What do you mean? But…
Bye.
Emilio? What are you doing in Paris?
You had disappeared.
We never saw you.
Your mom was desperate.
You were playing dumb.
Then you bailed out on Christmas.
She was destroyed. I mean, you know her.
-It was his idea, by the way. -You never objected.
Anyway, it started out as a game.
-A game? -Yes.
"I bet they'll come around for money."
Well, you did.
We'd have told you after Christmas.
It was so nice having you around.
Dad being sick was a game too?
Thank God, yes.
That was Mom who fucked up.
I didn't know what else to do.
But our life was going to shit meanwhile.
Shame on you both.
-We just wanted to-- -What?
Feel you were still there.
Have a nice Christmas.
Please don't. They'll come back. Where else will they go?
At least you have a Versace bag now.
Yeah.
I couldn't drive the Ferrari even once.
Grandma, why didn't you tell us anything?
God, no!
Never butt into family matters.
-You are family. -All the more reason.
-I even lost my job. -You couldn't stand it there anymore.
In the end, you're all to blame. But them most of all.
-Exactly. Thank you. -What do you mean?
Meaning I never would've wanted to admit
that they had to pay to get your affection.
They needed you so badly that they were willing to overlook
your indifference and your cold shoulders.
Thanks.
No, please.
I'll pay.
-No, Grandma, let her-- -Let me.
With all the money Aunt Tea left me,
I could buy this restaurant.
Merry Christmas.
Hi.
Hi.
Already taking them down?
Huh?
Yes, because… since we're no longer millionaires,
we need to save on electricity.
Yes, I heard about the prank.
Not really a prank. It was more…
a desperate attempt to get my kids' attention, but…
I'm sorry.
How are your kids?
I came outside to smoke, but I just wanted some quiet.
Do you hear how noisy they are?
And I can't stand my daughter-in-law. She cooks like shit.
Merry Christmas, then.
Merry Christmas.
Can't you wait until tomorrow?
Why? What do you care?
It's Christmas Eve.
Why don't we go to the beach for a few days?
No, it's too damp.
How about Paris?
We have that pending consultation with the oncologist, Dr. Roland.
-He came down with a bad disease. -Him too?
-An outbreak. -You're obsessed?
What was that?
What? What's wrong?
-Must be Santa Claus. Put out the fire. -Hold on.
-Do you hear that? Who's there? -Who's there?
Who's there?
There's someone.
What are you doing? Come here.
No, don't.
Come here.
-Merry-- -Dad, are you nuts? What are you doing?
Honey, he knocked out the same teeth.
-Jeez. -A little ice will fix everything.
First with a golf club, now with the poker.
Just shoot me in the face next time.
You snuck into my house like a thief.
A thief with Christmas sparklers?
I don't know. First, I saw a glare, then a stranger's face
with a fucking evil sneer, so I struck.
It's survival instinct.
Let's say this Christmas brought out the worst in us.
But now we're here, the four of us together.
Honey, smile.
Okay, never mind.
Even though I can't stand you, I love you.
It's nice to hear that once in a while.
Remember?
When you were kids, I used to put on this song,
and we'd go around the house on treasure hunts for Christmas presents.
We can hunt for my teeth. I wonder where they ended up.
Did you lose a molar?
Fuck if I know!
No need to curse.
It's Christmas.
This rug needs to be cleaned. How gross! Look at these stains.
-What do they look like? -Well, they're teeth.
Are they white?
-Did you lose a molar? -Fuck if I know!
Look for it.
How did you find out?
-I felt strange… -Dizzy.
He's fucking laughing.
-My name's Emilio, not Carlo. -Your name's Carlo.
Your sister wants to come at… at noon. I'll do it again.
-It's been years. Years… -Us…
Were you supposed to talk?
-It's super soft. Touch it. -Anna.
-Yeah. -You look great.
We haven't said shit yet. Oh no. My mistake, sorry.
I could see that coming.
Rocco fixed your…
You didn't finish?
-[Downey Sr.] Us? -[producer] Yeah.
See, if you could get this,
like a close-up or maybe from here up.
-[producer] Yeah? -[Downey Sr.] You got it going?
[producer] Well, no. I'm wide right now.
No, I would get in tighter 'cause it'll be a cutaway.
Yeah, you're gonna want this tight. We might as well get that insert now.
-Let us know when you're rolling. -[Downey Sr.] Rolling? Let's start again.
First, it's not moving. You say, "Oh, this is bullshit."
-[Downey Jr.] Yeah, yeah. -[Downey Sr.] Then it starts moving.
[Downey Jr.] "Wait a minute."
"Maybe that serpent's not full of shit after all."
-Dad, can I give it a spin? -Yeah, do it, please.
[Downey Jr.] This might be our first coproduction here.
[Downey Sr.] Nice. Nice!
-["Surf Finger" by Jack Nitzsche playing] -[Downey Sr.] Hey, it's nice!
-It needed your touch. -[Downey Jr. laughing]
[producer] Where would you go next?
-After this? -[producer] Yeah.
We're not even halfway to any ideas like that.
We're just having fun and getting started. [chuckles]
[Downey Jr.] Steady on those steps.
-[Downey Sr.] Oh my God. -Give him a hand, Rogers.
-[Rogers] I got it. -Let's not lose our principal.
[Downey Jr.] I'm very interested in who my dad is just in the here and now
because no one knows the hour and the day.
We never know how much time we have with each other.
I think, also, to me, like, he was just always this kinda looming figure.
Like, I was just Bob Downey's kid for a long time.
[Cavett] Success may burst like a clap of thunder over his head if he isn't careful,
and he's a talented underground filmmaker named Robert Downey.
Do you feel a little compromised by being here on a network television show?
No, because I know if the film doesn't open, and it doesn't do well, I won't get to make another one.
and it doesn't do well, I won't get to make another one.
[Downey Sr.] I knew the minute I started fooling around with this stuff
that it was better than working a job.
Shouldn't you be in school?
Fuck you.
And fuck the establishment.
And fuck you people
who are trying to make me part of the unestablished establishment.
[Downey Jr.] I was raised in this family
where doing underground films was the norm.
It was very natural to have no interaction with mainstream anything.
[Letterman] What was the first film you were in? One of your dad's projects?
-[Downey Jr.] It was. -[Letterman] What became of you then?
Then he became the highest-paid movie actor in the world.
-That's what he decided to do. -Yeah, I guess, Dad, come get your cut. -[Letterman laughing] -[crowd applauding]
[Downey Sr.] That's a shot with Robert and I ages ago.
And the photographer says,
"Why don't we each have you guys have chainsaws?"
And Robert said, "Get the fuck out of here."
Uh, we still… We're still happy with the title "Sr.," are we not?
Yeah, I like it, but we can… we can do better.
-[Downey Jr.] Where is Sr.? -[producer] The back house.
Yeah, let's go walk out there. Come on.
You will presently witness
the offspring of Sr.'s offspring.
Don't throw water balloons at the, uh… at my crew.
I like that that's his kid, and here's his daughter.
Good shot.
Great. Movement.
Nobody's sitting.
[Downey Jr.] Hey, have you seen any of Grandpa's movies?
No, why?
Because they're awesome. Do you wanna see 'em someday?
-[Exton] Uh, maybe. -Just a maybe.
Dude, if you're gonna throw a water balloon, hit me with it.
-That's good. -[Downey Jr. shrieks on screen]
[Downey Jr.] Avri, give us a wave. That's all we need. Just give us a little wave. Ah, Christ.
Just give us a little wave. Ah, Christ.
[Exton] Get… You need to get those hairs wet.
[laughing] Jesus H…
Don't you hit me again. I swear to God.
Don't… don't get the camera wet.
Quit it. Sr.?
Your grandson is boundaryless.
This is like growing up with my dad.
"Hey, whatever you do, don't get the camera wet."
-Did you get it? -We got it.
We don't have anything usable yet, except Exton provided some… some action.
-You mind if I switch out real quick? -No.
Thanks.
[Downey Sr.] I just wanna show you something before we do anything.
-Just me? -[Downey Sr.] No, Rosemary and you.
Here she is.
[Rogers] Robert had an idea of doing a documentary about his dad
and about their history and their life together.
You know, so many people, they know Robert Downey Jr.,
but they don't know Robert Downey Sr.
And he just wanted to, for the record, correct that.
[Downey Jr.] We're just finding our way into something that we hope winds up being interesting
and not the usual
and a bit of a foray into that crazy thing,
and a bit of a foray into that crazy thing, you know, of trying to understand your dad.
[producer] Do you feel like you understand him now?
I have a feeling I'll know a lot more… [laughs] …when we're done.
You come back, which is probably where we'll start,
to Robert and Rosemary on the couch, and we go from there.
Look, we'll do the same thing, except we'll do it out there. Yeah.
-"How long have you two been married?" -That's me, right?
-Yeah. -Yeah.
How long have you and Pops been married?
Fifteen hundred years.
See, I think this… We should switch seats.
You should. Let's get her in the middle.
-[Downey Sr. groans softly] -Oh yeah.
How long have you guys been married?
Fifteen hundred years. -Oh boy. -Mm-hmm.
Did that go better this time? She looked up in the middle of something up… up that way.
You're right. Let's do it again. Take three, opener.
[Downey Jr.] He would rather be doing a film about something else
than allow a documentary to be made about him.
So the middle ground has been he's doing his own version.
How long have you two been married?
Uh, fifteen hundred years this July.
-Oh my God. -I know.
-Oh wow, happy anniversary. Almost. -Thank you.
-Fine by me. -Okay.
-By the way, that's his directing style. -[Rogers chuckles]
[Downey Jr.] So then I put it to him this way. I said, "Dad,
the legitimate documentary we're making about you
is kinda what's covering the cost of this art film that you're making."
And he seems agreeable to that.
You got it? That's good. That's worth the whole day.
That's funny.
I'm thinking any visuals that you must like goes on file.
And you never know. It could end up right somewhere where you didn't expect it.
What's the guy who said, "One picture is worth a thousand words"?
It's one good picture.
Sr. would be one of the best people to caption photographs or street scenes
Sr. would be one of the best people to caption photographs or street scenes that you will ever meet.
In a more of a typical, mid-century, male, butch way though.
Oftentimes it's, "Look at this douche."
Look at this group.
-[Rogers] What's going on over there? -[Downey Sr.] AA meeting. [laughing]
"Let's go have a drink. Nobody'll know."
Look what's going on in that window.
There should be somebody on the other side
performing a wedding ceremony for somebody outside.
[chuckling] Maybe.
Well, here's the corner, and this used to be an apartment building. This is it.
I don't know what you're thinking, but maybe
you start on that and then hear the dialogue
and come over and show this.
[producer] Okay.
[Downey Sr.] 116 University used to be, uh, three lofts,
and we were on the next-to-top floor, the second one up.
Nothing's left.
[producer] Did you feel pretty grown up? Y'know, you had kids.
No.
No, that might be the problem. [chuckles]
I don't know what Robert thought, but it was different.
[producer] Were you making a film while you lived here?
Oh yeah.
"Downey film short"?
I don't know what that is.
I can get rid of all these.
I'm just thinking that I wanna go through my films
and pick out scenes that I know will work in what you're doing.
That's actually more important than anything.
Oh, this is interesting.
Let's start with this.
[Downey Sr.] There it is.
[woman] Love you, Walter. I'll see ya later.
[woman] I love you more than anything else in the world.
[Walter] I love you too, Mother.
That's good.
-[producer] Did you write that? -[Downey Sr.] Oh yeah.
This is how we got started.
[producer] Your career? The whole fucking thing.
[mother] You know, Walter, you can have whatever you want in this life.
I guess the only thing I really want
is you.
Chafed Elbows is a film about an oddball
Chafed Elbows is a film about an oddball who marries his mother and goes on welfare.
It is an ode to Oedipus.
My mother, she didn't appreciate Chafed Elbows, I'll tell you.
Jesus.
I said, "It's only a film." She said, "I don't care what it is."
[chuckling] "How dare you."
[Downey Sr.] We were having fun figuring out how to focus a camera.
None of us thought we were doing something that had an audience.
I know I'm robbing the cradle, but at least it's my own.
[Downey Sr.] Then suddenly, I got this little review in The New York Times.
The next morning, there was a line around the corner
for this little film in 16-millimeter.
[producer] What was inspiring you to make these movies?
[Downey Sr.] It was unique. It was different.
I mean, where else could you be doing something like making a movie,
and you've never made one before?
[producer] Can you hear that?
It all fits.
-[producer] What, the siren? -Yeah.
[producer] Okay, okay. Did people try to ascribe meaning to your movies?
Oh my God. I hope not.
[male voice] Would you people mind if I joined you?
-Come on, baby. -[male voice] Oh yeah?
Let me get my duds off here.
Move over, champ. -Lemme in there, huh? -[woman] Mmm.
[Downey Sr.] We didn't know what we were doing, but suddenly the films started getting better or weirder.
started getting better or weirder.
[Downey Jr.] After Chafed Elbows,
Sr. and Elsie, my mom, they were just always writing.
I think it's been a very creative day.
[Downey Jr.] There was this flow of people through the house
for dailies and writing sessions.
The time spent with him was perfectly, wonderfully,
The time spent with him was perfectly, wonderfully, deliciously insane.
I'm in the middle of a nervous breakdown.
[man] Well, do it somewhere else. We're busy in here.
[Lear] With an odd, odd sense of humor,
he is so much his own man,
so much his own artist.
[Arkin] There's a kind of benign nihilism through his work.
Just the freedom of it.
You didn't know where the story was gonna go.
You didn't know if there was a story.
There was a sense that each moment was allowed to play itself out
until you're hysterically laughing.
They'd moved whatever little crib I was in
into the area adjacent to where they were screening dailies.
So I got very used to falling asleep to the sound of clapboards.
It's almost like I was being programmed.
This one is Robert in a crib.
-[producer] Did you put him there? -It must have been me.
[Downey Jr.] And I just remember that cacophony of creativity.
Lots of cigarettes and weed and booze,
but mostly laughter.
If you don't give me those 12 H-bombs, I'm gonna drain your gold for ya.
That's right, man, 12 H-bombs, or I drain your gold for ya.
One of the things I liked best about him as a filmmaker and as a director,
he'd just let me go wild.
I might add a few improvised words or gestures, and I remember him saying,
"I don't know what it means, but I love it."
[Arkin] I don't know how he came up with his casting ideas.
I couldn't figure it out 'cause they didn't seem like actors. I didn't know what they were.
It's like he went down to the Bowery half the time
and just picked up people who were half in the bag.
But they were wonderful,
just a wonderful bunch of un-actory-looking people.
What's going on?
You gotta draw the line somewhere.
[Downey Jr.] If there was one undercurrent that was really shifty,
it was either, "We're flush," or, "We're broke!"
It was never like, "We're stable."
By "flush," I mean 500 bucks in the bank.
[man 1] We're ready to roll over here.
I made one with just stills almost 'cause we couldn't afford film.
[man 2] You can't direct nothing.
[man 1] If it wasn't for me, you'd be on unemployment with the rest of the scum
[man 1] If it wasn't for me, you'd be on unemployment with the rest of the scum of the underground cinema.
[Downey Sr.] The early ones, I made so cheaply.
Just working a job somewhere, I could get it done.
[Downey Jr.] Things were just grounded enough
that a very charismatic guy who had different ideas and curiosity
could create a new standard of filmmaking.
And I think he's someone who has preserved that curiosity
well into his autumn years.
There it is. There it is.
See it?
It's kinda reassuring to be in a city and see this, huh?
If you had to introduce this scene,
I wonder whether you would come down
I wonder whether you would come down or pan down from a building to this
or pan up from something here.
I don't know. Both, maybe, right?
That's an interesting image there. Wow. Like a Western.
[Downey Sr.] Look at 'em all. There are nine of them.
How could they have all come out of one duck?
Look at Mom, perusing the whole joint.
-Remember the ducks you shot? -[producer] Yeah.
They've grown. They're big.
We'll see 'em this afternoon if you want.
They're big.
I hope you guys are as happy as I am with this footage.
I think you need stuff other than about movies, for balance.
[producer] So it's not just about the films? -Right. -[producer] Who is this guy?
-Right. -[producer] Who is this guy? Exactly.
[producer] Who is this guy?
Uh, I'll never know. [laughing]
[Downey Sr.] There they are.
Oh my God.
I've never seen this thing with a real tiny one and a big one
all within a lifespan.
-Boy, I'm getting dizzy. -[producer] Oh shit.
-[Downey Sr.] Whoa. -[producer] Can you go to the bench? -[Downey Sr.] Yeah. -[producer] All right.
-[Downey Sr.] Yeah. -[producer] All right.
-[Downey Sr.] Oh my God. Oh boy. -[producer] That was a close call.
[producer] We gotta figure out how to get him back upstairs.
-No, I'll be all right. -[producer] You'll be able to walk up?
As long as you stick cl-- -relatively close, I'll be okay. -[producer] Yeah.
I… I think I have to face the, uh, idea of my problem
and just cut away to the shakes that I get sometimes.
You just see that going on.
And Rosemary, when it happens in a restaurant or something, she just… she'll just go over to me and go…
[chucking] …and it calms down.
-Yeah. -[producer] What is that?
[Downey Sr.] The Parkinson's.
I just thought… [spluttering] …you know… [spluttering]
…there's a certain way I have to eat now. Otherwise, the shit's all over the floor.
So,
let's face it.
-[prolonged exhale] -[Downey Sr.] Good morning.
Hi.
-[Downey Sr.] How are you? -[in sad voice] Sometimes I wonder.
Tell me everything. How ya been?
Um, okay.
[hesitating] Okay.
Is it a struggle?
Is it challenging? Is it weird? Is it scary?
On a certain day, any of those.
You know, I do think that that should… that should be part of the film.
-I like that you have this project. -[Downey Jr.] Me too.
I don't know why. It's… it's creative
I don't know why. It's… it's creative and, uh, soothing to me on so many levels.
Oh, yeah.
It's exciting because it's not like anything else.
Okay.
[Rogers] With Parkinson's, you lose a little bit of something every day.
But he's so fully focused on this film.
It's obviously energizing for him and exciting for him.
[Downey Sr.] It'll be on the left if it's on this street.
This might be it.
[Downey Sr.] Could be.
-[producer] Bob, where are we? -[Downey Sr.] Great Jones Alley.
Not Grace Jones.
We paid a bum $50
to lay down in a heap of depression.
And then we did the scene.
And he said, "Let's do it again," when we finished. [chuckles]
That was nice. I do remember that.
[producer] What was the scene?
It was a scene where there's… She's doing a commercial for…
Actually, she's just so great-looking, nobody cared what it was.
You can't eat an air conditioner.
[Downey Sr.] When I decided to make a film about an ad agency,
I think this is the quickest I wrote anything.
I was having so much fun.
If we use c-c-creative foreplay
before we penetrate,
we'll b-b-b-b…
[man 1] Bypass?
-[man 2] B-b-b-b… -Looks like.
-[man 2] B-b-b-b… -Sounds like.
-[man 2] B-b-b-b… -How many syllables, Mario?
-[man 2] B-b-b-b… -How many syllables, Mario?
-[man 2] B-b-b-b! -How many syllables, Mario? B-b-b! [groans]
[Downey Sr.] It's about a white ad agency
where the head of the agency dies and has a heart attack.
His board of executives take his rings and watches and so forth,
and they have to vote in a new chairman of the board.
The rules are you can't vote for yourself,
so they all vote for the one Black guy in the ad agency,
thinking nobody else will vote for him, and he's elected.
-Swope. -My father would have wanted it this way.
He dug you very much.
Your father was a horse's ass.
He goes up to the head of the table and says, "The changes I'm gonna make will be minimal."
[Swope] I'm not gonna rock the boat.
Rocking the boat's a drag.
What you do is sink the boat!
[Downey Sr.] Cuts over his back, and there's 40 Black people sitting there,
and the movie starts.
I hear the film is really funny. I would say that anyway, even if I hadn't.
-But, uh… but I really do. -I hope the film's more than funny.
-Do you? -I hope it has some sting in it too.
-As a window cleaner, forget it. -[funky rock music playing]
Put soybeans in it for protein,
and we'll push it as a soft drink in the ghetto.
There is no revolution the way you're running this joint, man.
Now, when is something gonna happen?
[Downey Jr.] Putney was right in the middle of all of that civil rights turmoil.
How did that concept come to you?
-I was working a job. -[Downey Jr.] Mm-hmm.
[Downey Sr.] And the Black guy working next to me said,
"You make more money than I do, and we're doing the same thing."
-[Downey Jr.] Right. -[Downey Sr.] That did it for me.
If I give you a raise, everybody's gonna want a raise.
And if I give them a raise, we'll be right back where we started.
[Downey Sr.] I didn't think anybody would come see it, but, boy, I… I didn't know shit.
[Downey Sr.] It seemed there was something going on
that hooked into whatever was socially going on
and what the movie was.
So it was a nice mirror.
[Downey Sr.] It wasn't really about the movie as much as it was about society.
[Downey Sr.] If everybody could get turned on
to having a sense of humor about themselves,
I think we could get over a lot of things that we take very, very seriously.
We could approach the serious matters in a different way,
like war and poverty and all the things that are going on.
♪ Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen ♪
♪ Take the world in a love embrace… ♪
[Downey Sr.] "Robert Downey makes vile movies."
Life magazine. Oh, really?
-[producer] What'd you make of that? -[Downey Sr.] That sounds all right.
And this, did you get that one?
[producer] Putney Swope was inducted into the Library of Congress?
That was wild that that film got in there. That's usually Hollywood films.
[Downey Jr.] What did that mean to you when you started getting the approval of the filmmakers
when you started getting the approval of the filmmakers that were, for lack of a better word, important in that generation?
that were, for lack of a better word, important in that generation?
That must have meant something.
Yeah, it meant that I could do another film.
Kinda like you belonged and you were being validated in some way?
Well, that's a pretty interesting theory.
Nice deflection.
He knows that I'm attempting to understand something
and that I'm turning a camera on him.
What he's trying to do is turn the camera onto what it is he's trying to say.
What that is remains to be seen.
What a bay over here, my God.
It's beginning to look like Rockaway.
[producer] Bob, why did you wanna come out here?
When I was 15, I used to come here in the summer.
It was known as the last stop on the subway.
Oh my God, you've gotta get that.
This is great.
Boy, that was wild.
[woman] Can we say "cheese"?
My friend.
My nutty friend. [laughing]
[woman] How long you guys been married?
Fifteen hundred years.
[producer] Do you ever feel like you're living in one of your films?
Right now.
[producer] Were your films this loose?
Sometimes, yeah. But this has been the freest.
Yeah.
Everything turns into everything sooner or later.
Things will turn into something else, which turns into something else.
And then something doesn't work. You throw that out.
It's called "follow the film."
I still feel, on some level, like he's fucking with us.
He knows that there's a bit of interplay between capturing a story about him
and also him keeping himself interested in the process.
And cut.
Wow! No transition required.
-[Downey Sr.] What's the difference? -I know what you're doing now.
-[Downey Sr.] What? -I know.
And because I believe he is connected
And because I believe he is connected to some sort of creative deity,
my job is to figure out what it all means.
[producer] What's this scene we're watching?
It's just, uh, the walk towards the, uh, door,
the out… outdoor door.
-[producer] How does it fit in the movie? -Who knows?
[producer] You directed this one. What's the po-- What's the plan?
[assistant] Yeah, your plan is what we need to hear.
Uh, I think we should split into two camps,
and both editing things are leading towards the same thing,
the editing of this film.
But you might get something out of one that you won't get with the other.
I think I should rent an apartment in this building
and get some equipment in here.
Let's go.
[Downey Jr.] You like the idea of getting a shot of the gate opening, right?
[Downey Sr.] If we can. [Downey Jr.] I think we can. We're gonna go down the road here.
[Downey Jr.] I think we can. We're gonna go down the road here.
I'm taking you down the garden path, Father.
And the farther away you are, the better.
[producer] Did you guys… Did you take a road trip together?
[Downey Sr.] Yeah, across the country once.
-From Santa Fe down to LA. -[producer] Yeah.
What was that like?
I was in charge of the hash pipe.
That was interesting.
I don't know if it belongs here, but I like it.
[Downey Jr.] Uh, we need a Jack Nitzsche cue right here.
[producer] So, from that, would you go into one of your films?
We could, or we could stick with this a little longer.
-[Downey Jr.] Don't go too fast. -[Downey Sr.] Whoa, wait a minute.
-[Downey Jr. laughing] -[Downey Sr.] Wait a minute. Jesus.
[Downey Jr.] His cut is very much a work in progress.
It is not all that linear.
It's like if you give a director no deadline
for when his project is supposed to be finished
or really any narrative for what it should be to begin with,
it can be a little, uh, kooky.
[narrator] Fourth floor. Solarium, aquarium, sanitarium,
drunk tank, celebrities, children's diseases, going up.
[Anderson] Bob doesn't seem to be that worried about confusing the audience. -Um… -[crowd laughing]
[Anderson] And that's why it's great.
There is a kind of pattern to the way that he does things
and that you either get with or you don't.
But, man, I'm, like, you know, smitten with it.
[Downey Sr.] You know, Paul, he loves films more than most people I run into.
When I met him, I couldn't believe he knew the '60s more than I know.
And he's a wonderful writer.
Action.
Come on, come one, come on! All right? All we need is the tapes, Burt.
No.
He asked me to pop in one day and fuck around on camera, and I did that.
We can't pay the price of the demo tapes
unless we take the demo tapes to the record company and get paid.
Hello? Exactly!
That's not an MP. That's a YP,
your problem!
I had fun with Paul Anderson, doing it. That was fun.
It's no mystery that Paul Thomas Anderson
is probably the son my dad wishes he had had,
and they like to rub that in my face.
[Downey Sr.] Paul says something something, and I said, "I gotta get out of here. I gotta go to my train."
And he said, "I'm coming with you." And I said, "What?"
[producer] Was this for a documentary or…
[Downey Sr.] You never know with him what he's doing.
He might have been doing something like that. I haven't heard about it since.
[Anderson] Let me get another battery before we go up.
For my pacemaker?
[Anderson] I mean, if you hang around with Bob to get to know Bob,
he's got the most fantastic sense of humor, and he just has this incredible confidence
to just commit to his rhythm of telling a story.
And so, as another filmmaker, it's invigorating.
And it reminds you, like, to have that confidence, to have that trust in yourself.
It's hard to walk, never mind hold the camera.
[Downey Jr.] Dad used to take the train. Last ride you did was with PTA?
But since, none, and no flying.
[Downey Sr.] Yeah, I don't fly anywhere. I'm paranoid.
[Lear] He was sensitive to the train.
He was sensitive to getting on and off the train.
[chuckles] He was sensitive to weather.
[Downey Jr.] Are elevators still a problem? [Downey Sr.] Oh yeah.
-That's some… Don't… -[producer] Oh shit.
I told you I was stuck in here for an hour and a half one night,
and I couldn't get out.
There was a Russian guy on the elevator.
Kept saying, "Are we gonna be all right?" I said, "How the fuck do I know?"
[Downey Jr.] Do you think all these neuroses, ultimately,
are part and parcel to creativity, or do you think they're just a drag?
-Little of both. -Yeah.
-I think we have some new characters. -[Anderson] Yeah.
The hour before the crash landing, it was scary.
Not the landing. We… we made it.
But ever since then, I haven't been able to face it.
[Anderson] So what are the chances you're gonna get in two plane crashes in your life?
I'll never find out.
I'm too scared.
That crash landing, that… that happened when I was in the army.
We were on a C-47, which is a two-engine plane.
And about an hour or so in, one of the engines stopped.
And a lot of us were really young.
Every time we'd see something coming close to the window in the plane,
it looked like the end. It was a tree or something else.
And finally, this sergeant guy started saying, "I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die."
And we're looking at him, like, "Are you fucking nuts?"
"You're supposed to be helping us."
Anyway, the plane landed, crash-landed.
Nobody died. Nobody got hurt. Just banged up a little.
He walks off the plane like nothing's wrong.
We started calling him every name in the book.
So he got a hold of me and put me in the stockade. [laughs]
[producer] Were you always a troublemaker?
Yes.
[producer] And so why did you think going in the army would be a good idea?
Who knows?
I used my stepfather's name to go in the army underage
with a fake birth certificate. Downey.
Elias is the actual blood name of both my dad, Robert Elias,
my dad's dad, my grandfather, also Robert Elias.
He changed it because, when he joined the army underage,
he did not feel that having a Jewish-sounding last name would be good,
whereas an Irish last name should be fine.
You spent a little time in the stockade here and there 'cause you can't stay out of trouble.
What would you call that chapter?
[Downey Sr.] "The Beginning."
-[Downey Jr.] Really? -Yeah.
Tell me why.
[Downey Sr.] The boss in the stockade said, "Don't just sit around here."
-"Do something." -Yeah.
[Downey Sr.] And he said, "Here, take this pad and write something down." Wow.
So I just started scribbling, and suddenly, some of it made sense.
A random act of kindness from your jailer.
You started writing.
Yeah, that's right.
[Downey Jr.] Did any of that wind up being the beginnings of any of your early work?
Yeah.
I had no idea.
Why do I have to die?
I never hurt anybody.
[Downey Jr.] In Pound, there was definitely a more dramatic backdrop.
[Downey Sr.] Yeah. Eighteen dogs waiting in a pound,
and they have an hour to live.
[Downey Jr.] If people are playing dogs, then really the movie is about people.
Me, him, and Fido are gonna bust out of here.
Who's joining me?
[Downey Jr.] It had a lot of tension in it too, which was great.
[Downey Sr.] In hindsight,
turned out that it was much better than I thought it was.
Seeing as how Pound was my official debut,
I think it's your most underrated of all.
[interviewer] Is this the picture Bobby Jr. made his debut in? [Downey Sr.] That's right.
-[Interviewer] At the age of what? A baby? -[Downey Sr.] Let's see. It was 1970.
So… five.
I… I think we asked him to do the part 'cause we couldn't get a babysitter,
and we knew that part was coming up.
And we, uh, summoned him. It was easy.
That tornado scared me so much, it made my hair disappear.
Have any hair on your balls?
I'm afraid to look.
I didn't know what the line meant, that I was asked to say,
which is, "Got any hair on your balls?"
-Oh, to the bald guy. Bald-headed dog. -To the bald guy.
-Oh, to the bald guy. Bald-headed dog. -To the bald guy. -He was playing a Mexican hairless, right? -Yeah, yeah.
-He was playing a Mexican hairless, right? -Yeah, yeah.
He seemed a little shy when he said it. It almost… But it worked beautifully.
You know, there was no need for a second take.
[man] Gimme that.
[producer] When you first put Robert on screen, did you recognize that he was…
[Downey Sr.] Everybody did.
Everybody was saying to me, "Oh, where'd you get this guy?"
It's that first time that's everything.
You could tell that he knew what he was doing.
He didn't need my help. He was possessed.
He was tap dancing in the driveway out there,
and subconsciously, I knew he never had to go to school.
This guy's gonna be an actor.
[Downey Jr.] When I saw cameras, I perceived it as it's time with my dad.
Sometimes, like, I… He would be walking by,
and he went out and grabbed the camera and said, "Don't move." [laughs]
I was like, "Whoa!"
[Downey Jr.] It probably felt to me what it felt like to Exton,
running around in the background and hosing me down with pool water
and, you know, asking,
"Are we shooting the movie again tomorrow?"
[Downey Sr.] That's Robert and his sister fighting in the kitchen.
I was just there with the camera on the other end of the thing,
just thinking of nothing, and this broke out.
[producer] How was Sr. as a father?
complicated in that most of his attention
was on the process of chasing the muse.
I knew that we were not like the other families.
I used to like to take him to films that I thought would be interesting
and not think about, "He's a kid."
In fact, they wouldn't let me into a film-- Oh, La Grande Bouffe.
Oh, La Grande Bouffe.
[Downey Sr.] Four guys in Italy get together every year and start feeding each other.
It gets so out of control. It's disgusting.
I forgot that Robert was with me, and I went to go see it,
and the person taking tickets says, "He can't come in."
"This is X-rated."
I said, "Come on."
So I called the distributor,
and he says, "Put that guy on. How dare he."
Blah blah blah blah blah.
And the ticket-taker takes the call and says, "You can go in now." [laughing]
I'll put it this way, we weren't watching Fantasia.
[Downey Sr.] In fact, I took him to see The Harder They Come.
[Downey Sr.] We went in, and it was raining that day, so there were leaks in the theater.
And we were sitting on the back of the seats.
And when we left there, we said, "Wow."
"There was nobody else in the theater but us."
And that, somehow, made it even better.
I remember a lot of theaters that were greasy and weird,
but it was this idea that films kind of brought us together
and, to this day, still do.
[Downey Sr.] I got… I got plenty of that.
Let's see if he doesn't hang himself on his sound wire first.
Do you mind if we show the crew in the documentary?
-Not at all. -[Downey Jr.] How come?
Because it lets everybody know we know what we're doing.
Right.
They might not like it, but we know what we're doing. Yeah.
It's pretty clear we know what we're doing here, right?
We have to know something.
Here's where we can talk about, uh, three generations of, um…
Bug jobs.
Of bug jobs.
What is it that I say to you when you're getting on my nerves?
Hey, hey, don't be a bug job.
-And that comes from Dad telling me. -Don't be a bug job. Hey!
For the very first time, you tell Pop to not be a bug job.
-Hey! -Mean it.
-Hey, don't be a bug job. -There it is.
-You don't be a bug job. -[Exton giggling]
What we're gonna do is we're all… the three of us are gonna have a quick espresso.
[Exton] I… I drink coffee.
You can have a little sip of mine, but don't tell Mom.
[Exton] I never tell Mom.
[Downey Jr.] Here's a good one.
Sr. as I remember him circa 1971.
So I would be Exton's age.
That's Pop, and that's my mom, Elsie.
And then that was another take.
This is from Greaser's.
That's from Greaser's Palace, yeah.
Most holy one, let me see.
Messiah. Messiah.
If you feel, you heal.
[man on ground] I can crawl again!
I can crawl again!
[producer] What was the genesis of Greaser's?
[Downey Sr.] Well, this lady wanted me to make a movie. She said, "What do you wanna do?"
I said, "Father, Son, and Holy Ghost pop into a Western."
She said, "Fine. Go write it."
She gave it to her husband, who had a lot of money.
He read it, and he said to me, "Is this gonna make any money?"
I said, "I don't think so," and he said to his wife,
"He's charming. Give him the money."
At least he was honest about what he really was thinking.
It didn't look like a Christ figure parachuting into a Western
is gonna make a dime. [chuckles]
[Downey Jr.] This time you got to really take advantage of the landscape.
The cinematography starts getting pretty lush,
and you have stunts, you have wagon wheels,
and you literally built Greaser's Palace
and then blew it up.
Do not make us doubt and speculate. Say to us why you are here.
[Downey Jr.] I know you like leaving the meaning up to the audience,
but there's deep, deep, deep spiritual messaging in that movie
that even as a grown-ass man, I'm still trying to figure out.
-I'm glad you said it. -[Downey Jr. laughing]
[Nancy] Bob, how are you?
I'm all right.
[producer] We know him as a provocateur and stirring the pot with his films,
but is there something surprising, as a sister, your take on him?
I always say that he's an innocent to me. He's an innocent.
-That's a new one. [chuckles] -And a purist.
-It's good. -No, it's true. You are.
Even as a person, you are.
He's irreverent in his humor, but he reveals so much. He's so honest.
Give me a hug.
[producer] When you saw Robert Jr.,
did you see similarities in father and son?
[Nancy] Oh yes.
[producer] You know, I feel like Robert got a lot of his humor from his dad.
Yes, but also, his mom was a riot.
How are ya doin'?
[man] Are you the Virgin Mary?
Just call me Mary.
[Wolf] Elsie Downey was a great actress,
who could have done incredible things on her own,
but chose to work with her husband.
She was extremely talented, lovable.
The sweetest person you'd ever wanna meet.
The only thing about these low-budget films
is that all the action is behind the camera.
[producer] With Elsie, was it clear right away
that, "Hey, we're gonna actually make these films together"?
No, I met her way before I made films.
Just off-off-Broadway plays.
[Nancy] When they met, it was like…
[mimics explosion] It was over. They were just… they got each other.
They would laugh. They would have us laughing.
I mean, she was just such a natural comedian.
So for Robert, coming from this couple,
he had to be who he was.
[producer] Did you feel like you learned from your mom as an actor?
Pretty much everything, yeah.
Seeing her being directed by Dad,
she was wildly devoted
to whatever creative stream of silliness he was onto.
And I remember when we were doing Greaser's Palace,
like, she was climbing up these sand dunes over and over again.
She had no problem doing something that's exacting.
-[producer] Did you put her in a lot? -Anything we could. 'Cause she'd do anything. She'd try anything. She knew what to do.
'Cause she'd do anything. She'd try anything. She knew what to do.
Oh, there's the moment when she discovers her son is dead.
And that's Elsie as the mother in Greaser's Palace.
She can't find her son, who's Robert.
[Downey Jr.] I played a boy who got his neck slit by God,
whose mother finds him.
[Downey Sr.] At the end of the film, he's brought to life again.
And I think he was so excited to do a scene with his mom.
[Downey Jr.] Greaser's, I had a lot of pride of
'cause I was old enough to know I was in it,
and I'm starting to feel like a little bit of a movie brat.
And it was a good time.
I mean, I wanna thank you. You got us out of town.
[Downey Sr.] That was fun. That was fun.
-[Downey Jr.] Was that a happy time? -[Downey Sr.] It was.
And then it all fell apart.
[woman inhaling] Ah!
I comes to a fork in the road…
…with a spoon in my nose.
[producer] What advice would you have given yourself at that point?
Don't touch drugs.
I have a job for you. Two tons of turquoise to Taos tonight.
[Downey Jr.] The title sequence
looks almost like a heist-type thing.
And all these characters are getting together,
but one guy walks in wearing a full wet suit.
As he's unhooking his weight belt, he goes…
[Downey Jr. and actor] "What about Larry? He's into tacos."
[Downey Jr.] And he snaps his belt open.
It was trying to transcend
even being something that people could say was a movie.
You basically said that the plot was Sanborn's saxophone…
[laughing] …which, to me, is so next level.
-That's true. You do follow the sax. -Yeah.
If you wanna hang on to something.
[female narrator] Let your mind go. Let your body go.
Let your wallet go.
[Downey Sr.] On this one, it was such a weird, disconnected thing.
I would maybe shoot for an hour and go home.
You know, 'cause I was tired or fucked up or whatever.
[Downey Jr.] I think the goal pattern was in a really weird place,
and so maybe that was justifying the usage.
My dad was down in the basement with his editor
seemingly for two years,
and I was like, "That seems like a long time on post."
You know, we knew what was going on down there.
[producer] Was that era fun? Was it a struggle?
I was a drug addict.
Mainly cocaine and, uh, marijuana.
Total, total insanity.
All right!
[Downey Jr.] I knew that the work had kind of started becoming more of an excuse.
And then it wasn't but shortly after that that my folks broke up.
[Downey Sr.] Turn around. Wave goodbye at the door. You're all fucked up with your umbrella. Say goodbye, and go inside. Bye-bye.
You're all fucked up with your umbrella. Say goodbye, and go inside. Bye-bye.
-[chuckling] -[Elsie] Bye-bye.
-[Downey Sr.] Have a nice nighty tonight. -[Elsie] Have a nice nighty tonight.
Yeah, even though we split from each other, we spoke to each other a lot.
-[Downey Sr.] Good night. -[Elsie] Good night.
-[Downey Sr.] And have a nice nighty. -Have a nice night-- Oh!
Yeah, it does bring back big memories.
[trainer] Deep breath.
-[groans] -And reach. Reach backwards.
And pull again.
You're breathing, right?
-I hope so. -[laughing]
Yes.
When I first came here, it was, like, a little tight.
-Yeah, that's a good way of saying it. -[both laugh]
[Jaime] We call on God a lot, right?
Like, God this and, "Oh, God, one more squat."
"Oh, God, another celery."
It's really funny.
-[Downey Sr.] Where is this guy? -[Jaime] We still haven't seen him.
No, every time I read the front page of the Times,
I say, "Where is this fucker?"
-[producer] That's pretty good. -It's great.
[producer] Then where? We have freedom.
Is there anything right wh… where you cut out?
[producer] Here we have…
Well, Robert must have thought something because he… he's a total workout guy.
Maybe he thought, "I don't wanna end up like my father."
-["Unfunky UFO" by Parliament playing] -That ain't bad. [laughs] That ain't bad.
[producer] Add it?
Yeah.
♪ You've got all that is really needed ♪
See, who knew we'd cross the bridge that I hadn't crossed today
because I thought I could get away without walking, and now look.
[producer] Do you love New York? Oh yeah.
I get inspired here.
How do you make a film in Los Angeles? We've seen every possible shot.
The same corner. The same freeway.
It's all different out here.
Look at this over here.
Jesus.
Look at the light now. My God, that's wild.
I guess this is crying out for a 360.
Wrong tripod.
The other good thing about any project in New York,
if you wanna go that way,
is to, once in a while, bring in the real sound we talked about.
-Turn it up. Don't say a word. -[song fades out]
Just happens.
[producer] Where do you go from there?
I'll look in here… [laughing] …and see if there's anything.
Maybe… We'll… we'll see.
Maybe, um, we break into the middle of Robert and me.
-[producer] Mm-hmm. -[Downey Sr.] Maybe.
[producer] Yeah, let's try it.
Hi, is this Dad?
[Downey Sr.] Yeah.
Is this Sonny?
[Downey Jr. laughing] This is Sonny Boy.
Hey, man.
[Downey Sr.] So, what do we wanna talk about?
[Downey Jr.] Let's talk about LA today.
-Oh my God. -I'm sorry.
We're gonna do it all, baby.
Oh my God.
[Downey Sr.] When you first get there and never been there,
it's kinda romantic because of all the literature.
But you soon find out it's a lot of lip service about,
"We really wanna make a film with you," and this and that.
"Let's see how it goes," and that kinda stuff.
The first question they ask you, usually, out there, when you make a film,
"You think it'll make money?"
You know, friends of mine would say, "You're doomed."
[major] You're outcasts,
embarrassments to your families and your communities.
Disgraces.
Something wrong with you, boy?
No, it's just a little chilly in here.
Don't you mean, "It's just a little chilly in here, sir"?
-[boy] Yes, sir. -Well, say it.
It's just a little chilly in here, sir.
-[major] Say it again. -It's just a little chilly in here, sir!
-Say it again. -It's just a little chilly in here, sir!
That's what I thought you meant.
Was Up the Academy ostensibly the first studio movie you ever did?
[Downey Sr.] Yeah. Disaster.
And I was thinking, "Get me out of here."
Tell me everything.
[Downey Sr.] It was supposed to be a military academy for kids.
The script was about 16-year-olds.
It'd simply be more effective if they're ten years old.
He said, "All the kids should be kids. We shouldn't be casting teenagers."
Now, that would have been a nightmare, and it was very impractical.
Was the studio gonna let it happen? No.
They said, "Are you insane?"
I said, "What do you mean? I just wanna change the ages."
"Well, you're not gonna do that around here."
I learned how to get along with people by doing what was asked of me.
No shit.
[Downey Jr.] Up to that point, he had kinda been protected.
People knew he was special,
and you wanted to help him do the next version of him.
And I think the one real studio-film experience he had,
where the studio kinda tells you what you can and can't do,
if you're an artist, it's crushing.
And I think he thought, "Great, let's party."
You're gonna get the Robert Downey movie you deserve.
[Downey Sr.] Some guy said, "If you keep talking like this,
we're gonna fire you,
and you're not gonna get final cut no matter what happens."
I said, "Okay, that's fine by me,
just as long as I get final cut on the cocaine."
And that was almost the end of me out there.
-You did not give a mad fuck, did you? -No.
How would you describe that period of time?
[Downey Sr.] Fifteen years of total fucking insanity.
Boy, man.
You know, I think we would be remiss to not discuss its effect on me.
Yeah, boy, I could sure love to miss that discussion.
[Downey Jr.] When I did Less Than Zero,
that was right around the time that I began.
It was obviously not
autobiographical for me,
but certainly what was similar was young folks, drugs, the '80s.
[producer] When you heard he was doing that film, what was that like?
[Downey Sr.] He was funny. He said, "I got a part in a legitimate film." [laughs]
You can't stay here. Live your life anywhere you want but not here.
-I'm your son. I'm sleeping here. -Get out. I'll call the police.
[Downey Sr.] But I loved it. It's a tough one, but it's great.
-It was just a wild era. -["Modern People" by Roger Neill playing]
[Downey Jr.] That whole world gets tied in with creativity.
We were all altering our consciousness with substances.
I was just kinda playing a game of just wanting to self-soothe
or just stay loaded
rather than deal with the fact that things had gone off the tracks a little bit.
And, honestly, more than anything, I look back and go,
"It's shocking
that a single movie came out finished."
But that didn't stop we Downeys.
[man] Hey, Reed! Will you stop with the food?
Rent is due. We gotta go to work. Come on.
-Work before we eat, all right? Come on. -[Reed] Okay. All right!
-I just made that salad! -Enough with the salads!
[Downey Sr.] The movie wouldn't have gotten out without him. That's reality.
[interviewer] Yeah. I mean, he's become a big movie star. -[Downey Sr.] Yeah. -[interviewer] He still takes direction?
-[Downey Sr.] Yeah. -[interviewer] He still takes direction?
Well, he loves fooling around. Yeah, he does. Whoo!
-Gotta go, Ma. -Okay, honey. Do what you have to do.
[interviewer] There was certainly a sense of… of family,
that people are having fun, and it's… it really translates.
[Downey Sr.] Good, I'm glad 'cause it was,
and it was a very good period of my life 'cause I met Laura.
I am hip to your shit, shithead.
I think Sr. was afraid I would be a terrible actress,
so he thought, "Throw an accent on, and maybe they won't notice."
-[Downey Sr.] That's not true. -[Laura laughing]
[Downey Jr.] Thank God for Laura Ernst.
Yeah, I agree.
She showed up, and I feel like it was just the kind of energy you needed
She showed up, and I feel like it was just the kind of energy you needed at that point in your life. Mm-hmm.
And it seemed like you just got healthier
and started kinda taking care of yourself
and settling into and away from that whole drug-culture life
that we all got stuck in.
-Hi, Dad. -Hi.
And I remember it very, very, very profoundly.
[Downey Sr.] A lot of us did things and thought it would be hypocritical
to not have our kids participate in marijuana and stuff like that.
So we thought it was cute to let 'em smoke it and all that.
It was an idiot move on our parts, a lot of us,
to share that with our children.
I'm just happy he's here.
-[Downey Jr. chuckling] -That's all. [kissing]
[interviewer] Ever worried he wasn't gonna be here?
Many times.
[Downey Jr.] Even though it took me another 20 years to get my own shit together,
you and Laura became this very, very, very stable force for me.
What is your memory of those years with Laura?
A lot because, uh, sh… she got sick.
And were you with her when she got the diagnosis for Lou Gehrig's?
[Downey Sr.] Yeah.
How does one process that with your… with your life partner?
It was… it was time to grow up,
to think of somebody else first.
[Arkin] We spent some time with him and his wife, Laura.
He was as loving and tender with her as any human being I've ever seen.
with her as any human being I've ever seen.
It was a lesson in how to deal with somebody who's… who's passing.
in how to deal with somebody who's… who's passing.
I sometimes think of…
…any of the stuff we feel guilty about or what we did in past relationships,
and then to be able to have an opportunity to, um,
make that living amends so fully to… to… to a partner
and to completely commit to being by their side
through every step of a devastating illness.
And, uh, it's crazy. You really showed up.
I hope so.
[computer voice] What I have is not contagious.
What is it?
[computer voice] ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
I love you.
Just another one of God's little victims.
Like me.
[Downey Jr.] Very much like when Chaplin lost a kid,
and then the next movie he made strangely was titled The Kid,
and it was a way for him to process the grief in his personal life.
That's exactly what you did in Hugo Pool.
You're gonna beat this.
[computer voice] I like the way you think.
[Downey Jr.] Your movie was representing everything
from Laura's illness
to my addiction to your turnaround.
Since you're gonna outlive me, will you forgive me for all the drugs
Since you're gonna outlive me, will you forgive me for all the drugs and bad examples that I'm leaving you?
[Downey Sr.] It's a collage of pain.
And so you… you try and go through it the best you can.
When you lost her, you stayed clean, and I was still out there,
and you were just telling me to stay on the planet and stay vertical
and not give up and all that stuff.
You weren't exactly some karma-free man.
Let me not fucking… You know. Let's not stretch the truth here.
But that was kind of a super significant thing.
Well, it's nice to hear it that way.
You deserved it with what you went through.
Yeah.
All right. That's worthy of an evening's nonsense.
[Downey Sr.] After the bad films that I directed out in California,
friends of mine would say, "Get out of LA now."
Did I tell him to get out of LA?
But it didn't mean he couldn't visit. Now he doesn't even come and visit.
He won't get on a plane.
[Lear] Between New York and LA,
there's no question he should be… [laughs] …in New York.
I think he's happier for being out of LA.
I think everybody's happier when they get out of LA.
The land of broken dreams.

for somebody to be their unique person.

By the way, every day I think about your dad.

Boy, was he funny too.
Yeah.
You look good, Pops. I'm glad there's some levity there,
and you're surrounded by good people, and--
I don't know any of them.
Now, say we wind up out in the Hamptons again together.
Are there any scenes to be shot
or images of stuff you want
that you're not seeing in the project right now?
That German folk song.
I knew you were gonna say that,
so I'm gonna have to get an accompanist to learn that song,
and we're gonna have to figure out where to shoot that.
-[Hayes] Hello? -Hey, it's me.
[Downey Jr.] Pop, this is for you.
Just, let's try it from the top again. It's just coming a little…
When I was 15, I entered the Kiwanis solo festivals,
singing Schubert's "Fischerweise,"
and it was the first time that Pop ever noticed something I was doing,
and it was the first time that Pop ever noticed something I was doing, outside of his movies, had some merit.
Or I think I got an honorable mention.
And, uh… and then it's been something I've returned to several times.
And tell us what his reaction was.
[exhales] He seemed pleased.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
And how did that change your life going forward?
[Downey Jr.] There's something nostalgic about it.
There's something beautiful about the song.
And then there's my dad's oddball point of view
of all the things he could have pulled out or remembered
that he would want me to repeat 40 years later.
[Downey Sr.] Uh, it will really help the film tremendously
when, suddenly, you just come out from behind a tree…
-[Downey Jr.] Yes. -…and sing this thing.
[Hayes] Let's do it again.
♪ …my life ♪
-[Hayes laughing] Here we go. -[Downey Jr.] I'm gonna nail it this time.
[Downey Sr.] It all looks sweetly narcissistic.
[producer] Do you see a place for this in our cut?
Absolutely. [chuckles]
-Can you do that a little more? -[producer] Like, repeat it?
No, I'm just being happy.
[producer] Let me try.
[Rogers] He completely focused on the edit.
He sat up for hours and hours,
which was something he hadn't done in a long time.
It's just a big source of joy for him. You know, it really is.
It's… it's everything for him.
-[producer] That's pretty good, dude. -I just wanna see it again.
-[producer] Let's see. -[playing slide whistle]
Have you changed as a filmmaker, or do you still make stuff the same way?
That's a good question. I really don't know.
[producer] What was the last film you worked on?
[Downey Sr.] It was a documentary down in Philadelphia that I'm very fond of.
It's about a park called Rittenhouse Square.
After I sat in the park and saw all the weird characters,
I said, "I'm in."
[Downey Sr.] And we spent a year in there to get the different seasons,
just studying people.
The one thing we learned was
trust anything 'cause anything will happen.
And sure enough, the first day, we ran into a ten-year-old violinist,
who was great, and she became the main focus of the whole year in the park.
[producer] How did making the documentary compare to, like, your other films?
Well, I like… as I said earlier,
I like the idea you don't know what's gonna happen.
[Susan] Sr., you know, he's battling a horrible, horrible disease
that I had to see my dad go through.
And so at this point, it's all just love of the time we have left.
And I don't know if Sr. has come to terms with some of his behavior from back then
or how it relates to Robert.
But what I know now is, you know, this is somebody who loves his kid.
[Downey Jr.] It's the quintessential Sullivan's Travels.
Setting out to do something real and important,
and what if what we'd been doing all along
was every bit as important as it needed to be?
For me, this feels like trying to close the circle
on that whole patriarchal thing.
[Downey Jr.] And making peace with all the
upside and downside of it and sideways-ness of it.
And then saying, "Okay, you're a grown man now."
Lean and mean, Bob. Lean and mean.
[producer] That's a whole new pass, man.
Well, you don't have to worry about when you're coming back now.
It's whenever it happens, it happens.
Thanks for doing this. It's big deal.
Great. You did some great work.
[producer] Yeah.
Looking back… [indistinct] …he says it's been a great experience.
His definition of a producer is a guy who gets stuff done.
Yep, yep, yep.
Heading the 90 miles in town. He's pumped.
This is year three
of shooting the Daddy doc.
I'm excited to see Grandpa.
The plan for today, we're gonna keep shooting the "Sr." documentary.
The main reason I wanted to be here was because I wanted to see Grandpa.
So, I wanted to see him
so we could, sort of, have memories.
And… so when he passes, I can say
I got to spend some time with him.
[Downey Jr.] Hi, thank you, sir. We're here for Downey. Thank you.
Hi, Dada.
Whenever, uh, you'd rather we're not rolling, just let us know.
Otherwise, we're in your face all day, all the time.
[producer] It's good to see you in person, man.
Is it… is it warm out?
[producer] Cold. Cold and rainy today.
Ooh, well, that's good… good for photography.
[Downey Jr.] Exy, when you're ready.
[Downey Jr.] We're gonna give you three takes at asking him the question, all right?
So you'll hit… come here, hit him with the line.
-Hey, Exy. -Hi.
Okay, he's ready. In three, two, one, go.
Hey, Sr.
Have any hair on your balls?
Would you repeat that question?
Have any hair on your balls? Perfect.
[Downey Jr. laughs] Now, give him the answer line one time, Dad.
Exy, hit him again, and then you do Larry Wolf's "I'm afraid to look."
[Exton] Hey, Sr. Have any hair on your balls?
Do I what?
He refuses to do his own answer.
-All right, you are free. -That was very fun.
[Downey Jr.] Exy's having a ball, dude. This is, like, the best trip he's ever had.
[Exton] It's definitely up in, like, the top ten.
You need anything?
Where are we?
This is the last day, uh, that I'm likely to see him for a while,
so what's my move for him, for me, just to kinda…
You know, it's weird because I know that I'm…
uh, capturing it.
[therapist] Oddly, it's sort of like what your family does.
You guys make art of your lives.
It's weird. It's natural. Like, it brings me back where it's like,
whatever's unfolding, funny or tragic,
it's happening with a 16-millimeter camera going,
and, uh, we can reflect on it… [chuckling] …40 years from now…
[therapist] Yeah. …when somehow or other it makes sense.
But then there's some part of me that feels like I'll… [sniffling]
I'll miss something.
[therapist] Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
You know, just 'cause the window's closing a bit, it seems.
[therapist] Is there anything that you feel like you need to process
in relation to the possibility of not seeing him again?
I just don't know, to be honest. -[therapist] Yeah. -You know?
Um, it's kinda disorienting,
but, uh… [sighs] …dude, it's a lot.
[therapist] It is a lot, man. It's a lot.
[sighs] Well, the nice thing is
I haven't had this appreciative an experience of New York in ages.
And getting to see it through Exton's eyes,
the third-generation POV,
is pretty cool, you know?
[therapist] Yeah, but I can't help but also notice
the difference between
the reliability of his support system, you know?
Your dad rebelled against something that needed to be rebelled against,
and then you were raised in that rebellion.
Yeah. [therapist] Letting you use drugs as a child.
And it's like… it's kinda fucked up!
[Downey Jr.] Battered but not broken.
[therapist] Yes. And then here we are.
It's like, "How do I go out without feeling like I missed something, you know?"
Is there anything you need to say to him?
I just… I don't want to…
-I don't wanna do the wrong thing. -[therapist] Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Papa.
Give us a… give us a "one, two, three," so we can check your mic.
-Who? -[producer] "Who." Great.
[Downey Jr.] Perfect.
While we're still hanging out and seeing each other,
I just wanna try to stay close and get closer and closer and closer and closer.
-Yeah, great idea. -[Downey Jr.] You know?
I was gonna ask you all these questions about just…
-Any… anything. -[Downey Jr.] Um… Yeah?
I don't really even know how to talk about this, but I just want…
your point of view, um,
before we are done.
Is there anything you want your kid to know?
[Downey Jr.] What's so funny?
Well, in the Hamptons, my kid has a house and a kid. Like, two kids, three kids.
Like, two kids, three kids.
And, uh, we… we find if we pick
days when the light's not great, that's good for us.
Right.
'Cause by the time you shoot it…
it's a good time to make any kind of film you wanna make.
[Downey Jr.] When you're not here in the here and now, where does your mind go to most?
Is there a period in time?
Or is there something that's occupying your thoughts?
From what I can remember,
before I answer your question,
I would say the…
Charlie Parkinson's disease.
[Elsie] I have this here dream where I'm working in this here jazz group.
And right in the middle of a very groovy set,
just as I'm starting my solo…
[Downey Jr. and Elsie] …I keel over and die from Charlie Parkinson's disease.
[Downey Jr.] You called it, baby.
Is there a pen over there?
A pen? You want a pen or a pencil?
Pen.
Yeah.
Ah, the old pen.
You love a bit of pen-and-paper action.
I can pop it for you if you want.
Here.
Thank you.
-[Downey Jr.] Are you scribbling? -Yeah.
[Downey Jr.] Nice.
Oh, and Robert…
had been a…
a little nervous 'cause he has all these other things he's doing too,
but you can see what he's focusing on is this.
When he called me up to ask me to…
He says, "Go slow."
Had you two met before?
[Downey Jr.] You mean Jr. and I?
Yeah.
[Downey Jr.] Yeah, we're getting to know each other.
So we'll probably head back home in a little while.
Even though Sr.'s just kinda napping,
should we just go sit in there for a while before we cut out?
-Yeah. -Okay.
So we'll probably let Sr. rest, and…
and then we'll see him, uh,
down the road a piece.
[Exton] Yes.
[Downey Jr.] I love you, Pops.
[Downey Jr.] We had no overt agenda with this project.
I had a sense of what it might be,
and I knew that part of it was always going to be
the end of his life.
Is it a father-son story? I don't think so.
Is it about what it is to be an artist? I don't know. Maybe.
Is it a contemplation of death?
I think it's kind of turning into that,
and not in a morose way,
but just in a "we're here, we do stuff, and we're gone."
And, um, I love him for what he did. I love him for what he didn't do.
[man] He has come!
I bring you a message.
Exactly six miles north of Skag Mountain in the Valley of Pain,
there lives an evil devil monster.
His name is Bingo Gas Station Motel Cheeseburger
With A Side Of Aircraft Noise And You'll Be Gary Indiana,
and he loves to hurt people.
The last time I saw Bingo Gas Station Motel Cheeseburger
With A Side Of Aircraft Noise And You'll Be Gary Indiana,
he told me what he wants to do.
He wants to come down here and kill each and every one of you.
But I said to him, "Bingo, wait a minute."
And the reason I said that is because I believe in you people.
I believe you can do the job.
I believe you can help each other.
I believe you can make this world a better place to live in.
That's it.
Take a card, Mr. Greaser.
All right. Put it back anywhere.
-[man] This it? -No.
-[man] This one? -No.
-[man] That one? -No!
-[man] This one? -No!
-That one? -No.
-[man] That it? -No.
-That one? -No!
-This one? -No.
-That one? -No.
-This one? -No!
-This it? -No.
-That it? -No!
-This one? -No.
-Here it comes! -[Greaser] No.
-This one? -[Greaser] No.
-That one? -[Greaser] No.
We can't go to my house anymore. Ermanno's coming back.
We can't go to my house anymore. Ermanno's coming back. He'll beat me up.
Elena, go to Marcella's.
I tried to call her. She's not picking up.
Let's try again.
You have to go.
-I'm not leaving you. -I told you to leave!
Stay behind me.
Elena…
Get in.
I'd rather walk.
Give us the child.
Stop!
Great! Good job!
Yeah, but give me a few seconds.
Good job.
-We stopped. You can clear the area. -Okay. NOVEMBER 1ST, 1978
Everyone, please, step back.
Come on, please, step back.
Please, step back.
-What movie is this? -Rome Without Mercy.
I love that actress! Who else is working on this movie?
I am, ma'am. Who else could be working on it? Come on.
Careful.
…six months have passed since the discovery of Aldo Moro…
…and then you add a handful of salt.
And… then once you put all the layers on top,
you put a nice plate over it…
God, I hate politics.
We've been hearing the same stuff for months.
…some demonstrations of protest…
Is this better?
This guy's also yapping about politics. He's always talking.
My gosh, I really can't stand him.
Hold on a second.
The film started 10 minutes ago.
But you can catch the first 10 minutes at the next screening.
I'll go in now, thanks.
So, as I was saying, you really need to sweat the eggplant.
When all the moisture has come out, then it's ready.
What?
-Aren't you jealous? -Not really.
Too bad.
I'll enroll at the university to study architecture.
-They won't take you in. -You'll see.
They'll take you in at the zoo, surely.
And the storks return in flight,
quick, outstretched legs, long beaks, to challenge the storms…
Nice lines, right?
Beautiful and very deep.
Stop! No, stop! No!
Give up!
I win!
I give up. You win. You're the champion.
I won!
I won! I won.
All right.
-Will they take you into the army? -Of course.
-Will you go far away? -One way or another, I will.
No way, you're not going anywhere.
Don't be a hero, they won't take you.
Why wouldn't they take me?
You know, they leave smart people at home.
Yeah, and fools will go to war, right?
I don't want to be teased by you, you know?
Oh, well…
-I have to tell you something. -I don't want to hear it.
Do you want to go for a smoke with me?
In the hallway.
No, thanks.
-Listen… -What are you giving me tomorrow?
It's a secret.
I don't want some sweets that I'd eat right away and then forget.
I want something that can last. Almost as long as you and me.
For years and years.
Give me a kiss.
When you hold me in your arms, I fear nothing,
not even war.
So stay close to me.
But I didn't see the ending.
I only saw the first 10 minutes.
-I saw it until the end. -Yeah, you saw it in the bathroom.
No, I was in the theater.
You were looking at people next to you.
He's new.
-He's cute. -Wait.
-The guy from yesterday was hotter. -The blonde one?
No way. He was a hot flop.
He's one of those who says, "No, thanks, I don't smoke."
He thinks he's hot stuff, but he's all show.
He is.
You want a smoke?
Thanks.
I've seen you somewhere before. Maybe here. Do you come often?
No, it's my first time.
Is it, really?
I came here by chance.
Do you come here often?
Sometimes, when I want to watch a good movie.
Come with me?
Wait, please.
What?
Not here.
Then why did you come in?
To be alone with you.
But you are turned on.
A lot.
But I can't do it here.
I'm Enea. What's your name?
-Pietro. -Pietro. Nice name.
Honestly, I don't feel like it. Not in here.
Where?
I don't know.
Don't you like me?
No…
I like you a lot, that's why the idea of doing it here…
Your heart is pounding.
Are you crazy?
Sorry.
RESTROOMS
Tomorrow, here?
Sure.
Bye, Titti.
Today's movie was touching, wasn't it?
-Why? -You all come out with these dreamy faces.
It was really, really good.
-You didn't even watch it till the end. -I'll watch it tomorrow.
We won't play it tomorrow.
We change movies every day. You should know that.
Of course, today's was definitely better than last week's.
No doubt about it.
-Do you still work in the movies? -A few gigs.
I'm still in school, and sometimes I volunteer on sets.
Really?
How lucky, good for you. I would've loved to be in the movies.
I wanted to be an actress.
If you direct your own movie, will you call Titti?
I wish.
-See you tomorrow. -Hey, guys.
Calm down, though. You've been very noisy in there today.
You shut up.
You wish you could be as noisy as them.
Bye, Titti.
Are you done with the accounting?
Go on, then. Go away, go, go.
Dad?
Sorry I'm late.
So? How was the movie?
-Good. Very… -Romantic.
You would've liked it.
It's confirmed. I'll be out soon.
A new heart.
Now we have to see how it responds to an old body.
Don't exaggerate. It's just one valve.
A simple procedure.
That's what they tell you.
I would know.
I'm not studying botany.
That's true.
I'm sorry, doctor.
Good evening.
We're in the kitchen.
I think I'll be sleeping at your place soon.
What happened?
Crazy Catherine is threatening to pack up and move back here.
It's her house too. Her husband is a drag.
But he's so hot.
Good evening, Carlo.
I really liked it this time, you know?
Me too.
So it's true, you weren't lying.
You two really didn't do anything?
He's not the type.
He's shy, clumsy.
I think it was his first time.
Yeah, but he still followed you to the restroom.
He was horny, but he couldn't do it.
If that's the case, then… he won't show up again.
Alice, he said, "See you here tomorrow."
-I'm almost sure he'll come. -Almost.
That "almost" is all I have.
I can't get him out of my head.
I need to find another place. He won't do it in the restroom.
Can you blame him, my love?
Oh.
Remember we have classes all afternoon tomorrow.
I'll say I'm sick.
If you keep this up, you'll get kicked out eventually.
What's more, volunteering on sets from time to time is fine,
but you do it too often.
They can't kick me out. I'm too talented.
If I had an ounce of your self-confidence, I could really turn my life around.
Me too, with that body and that ass.
You… dirty chauvinist pig.
Spend the night here.
We weren't even done yet, and you were already talking about him.
No, thanks. You're somewhere else.
What am I going to do all night without you?
Think about him and masturbate.
Come on.
Adele, you have to listen to me.
Don't call him back, don't be so clingy.
When it comes to love, you need to play hard to get.
No, you have to do what I do.
When they fall in love, I disappear.
And they always come back with a nice gift.
Yeah. Hold on a second.
Can I go in just to see if there's someone waiting for me?
Only because I'm in a rush.
-Your beau isn't here. -What? You even know who he is?
Ade, I'll call you back.
The hottest guy from yesterday.
I haven't seen a guy like that in decades.
We didn't even come out together.
So? I have a radar.
I notice everything.
Anyway, you can go in.
Just 'cause it's you, and you work in movies.
-Thanks. -Let him in.
-Congratulations. -Have another drink. Here, on me.
This drunkard.
-To your health! -To yours!
I really need it, with all these diseases going around!
-Fingers crossed. -Bye!
Bye, Biancofio'!
-Bye, dolls! Bye! -Bye!
Oh, my beauty, goodbye The army is going
-What are you looking for? -Just getting some fresh air.
-I'm not a prostitute. -About time.
Hey!
-How did it go with that hot guy? -Was he a good fuck?
-We didn't fuck. -Yeah…
Sure.
What did you do in there? Did he come too soon?
You don't get it.
We talked.
-It's a restroom, not a living room. -That goes for all of us.
I only go there to fuck. I swear.
Look who's back.
Hey.
-Where have you been? -I was busy.
-Why are you here? -Try to guess.
Never mind. What happened to Che?
Did you kill him already?
It's an on and off thing. Our fucking business.
Yeah, sure. Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. My God…
Enea, I need to talk to you.
Molotov!
-Can I ask you something? -What?
How many dicks did you take in the military?
A lot, too many. One life is not enough to see them all.
-Not even if you lived 100 years. -I love you too.
Are you coming to the protest tomorrow?
-I can't, Molotov. I have class. -Is that a reason?
What happened with Che?
We had a fight.
I didn't want to say it in front of those bitches.
He's a constant pain in the ass.
He didn't forgive me for not being a conscientious objector.
He thinks I like him only because he looks like Che.
He's pissed that I don't teach how to make Molotov,
and he says I've become a reactionary.
Well, Che has always been out of it.
Hi.
-Hi. -He's my friend. He's leaving.
Hi, I'm Ernesto.
Pietro.
But everyone calls me "Molotov." Whoever I touch, lights up for me.
-Okay, you can go now. -Relax! I wasn't going to steal him.
You don't know what you're missing.
He always exaggerates.
He's harmless, though.
Sometimes he's even nice.
I came here for you today. But I don't have much time.
I thought maybe you didn't want to be here.
No.
Not like yesterday.
I may have a place where we can be alone.
Where?
It's my friend's grandma's place. Nobody lives there.
I don't know if my friend has the keys.
-Do you have to call her? -No, she's at school.
We're classmates.
I could swing by the school. See you there in an hour?
I'm not sure.
You asked me to meet you here.
-I know, it's just… -Well, if you're not sure--
If we're not sure…
we can go for pizza. We don't have to do anything.
This is the address.
I think I'll stay and watch the movie.
You even brought a map?
"So time and space won't get in the way."
"So time and space won't get in the way."
What if your friend can't find the keys?
Then we'll eat pizza. Are you in?
Yes.
Okay, I'll take my Vespa. You watch the movie. It's beautiful.
-Have you seen it? -No, but if Titti says so, I believe her.
Who's Titti?
The cashier.
SO TIME AND SPACE WON'T GET IN THE WAY
-Hi. -Hi.
Your friend is lucky.
She never said her grandma had a house like this.
Let's see what's up there.
Enea, look.
Wait.
You don't want to?
No, it's just…
It's your first time, isn't it?
Should we get that pizza?
I'm thinking about it.
Do you want me to teach you how to--
Wait.
Sorry, I'm really excited.
It's okay.
It's okay.
This is your friend's grandma when she was young.
I found some liquor.
Grandma's liquor?
I remember where I first saw you.
They were shooting a movie a few days ago.
I got closer.
And when they cut the scene, you moved a barricade.
We exchanged looks, remember?
No, I don't remember.
I don't pay attention to passersby.
They get on my nerves. I have to make sure they don't get too close.
I don't work, I study.
I study too. I'm a film student.
In the final year, as a director.
I'm a med student.
Cool.
That's a lot of years.
A doctor.
I like doctors.
Thinking about it, I have a slight discomfort right here, doctor.
And another one here.
And here?
With you, I feel better already.
Do you live with your parents?
Yeah.
-You? -With my dad.
I came with my mom, who needed surgery.
It went well. She'll be out in a few days.
Where do you live?
In Marche.
-Would you grant me this dance? -No, I can't dance.
Come on. Should I dance on my own?
All right.
But I can't dance.
Follow my lead.
Are you still hungry?
No.
I am.
Do you know who met here for the first time?
Two people who had no idea how much they'd love each other.
I know this story.
You told me you didn't remember, though.
I don't know why I said that.
To defend myself, I guess.
From what?
When will I see you again?
Let's meet at the Nuovo Olimpo in the afternoon.
I don't know what time. If I'm late, you could watch the movie.
You watch it too if I'm late, though.
Stupid. Come on, I'll take you to the bus stop.
No need. Piazza Venezia is around the corner. I can walk.
Go.
-Please, Enea. -Stop following me.
I won't go with you, okay?
-Titti, hi. -Hi. You have company. That's new.
-He's coming to the protest with me. -Don't listen to her. Give me a ticket.
The movie's worth the ticket today and not only that. My treat.
The protest is more important.
Enea, it's here, in Piazza Venezia. It's a 10-minute walk.
You have to come. You can't just mind your own business in here, you know?
-Sorry. -No problem.
Ask him to go with you.
-Is he here? -He's watching the movie.
To avoid being seen he's hiding under the armchair.
He's so shy.
Get in, get him, and we'll go. So I can finally meet him.
No, this is my thing.
At the next protest, I'll give a speech, okay?
Good for you! Congratulations!
You're another servant of power!
The more you become a faggot, the more you're like a fascist!
Fuck you, Enea!
My gosh, how aggressive.
Is she an ex-girlfriend?
Even more.
You can tell she's a committed activist.
He arrived at the bar half an hour early.
He was waiting for you. If you know what I mean…
Wait.
Nuovo Olimpo.
Please hold.
Don't stop coming here because you two fell in love.
-We can come back to watch a movie. -Right…
You'll make your own movies at home. One at 5:00, at 8:00 and at 10:30 p.m. Go.
Yes.
No, it's Nella città l'inferno, today. You're welcome.
Hey, you don't get it. You need to shut your mouth.
-Hi. -Hi.
Sorry, I couldn't get here earlier.
Don't worry.
This one is good.
Look how pretty that one is!
Yeah, you, come here!
I don't have the key anymore.
What are you doing?
I'm smelling you.
I missed it.
I booked a table at a restaurant.
I want to look at you over a glass of wine.
Like two ordinary people sitting at the table.
I have to stop at the clinic first. I have to speak with the doctor.
I'll be back in an hour, tops.
You could have come straight after.
I wanted to tell you in person.
Can I come with you?
No, I don't want you to wait outside, alone.
I'll watch the first half of the movie.
See you in an hour at the bar in the square, okay?
Right when the first half ends.
The hallway is for smoking only.
-What do you want? -Guys!
-Fuck off, you're always bothering me. -Watch the steps. He's injured!
Titti let him in. It's crazy outside. Hydrogen peroxide, you take care of it.
-Principe, move! Get the sink! -What? Drink. Let's rinse his face.
-No. Let's use the peroxide. -Take this.
Guys! It's crazy out there. The police are everywhere!
Pietro.
-What did they do to him? -Molotov, I have to go.
-Wait, please. -No, I can't, sorry.
-No, don't go, please! -Come on, relax.
They're closing the door!
-It's not closing! -Titti, let me out!
No! You can't come in!
You can't come in!
Stop the movie!
-Turn on the lights! -Stay close to me!
Turn on the lights!
Titti, I have to find a way out.
Yeah, wait here. Stay close to me.
-Don't move. -We'll resist!
No, he works here! He works with me!
Shame on you!
-Leave them alone! -Police!
Power to the workers!
POWER TO THE WORKERS
Let me go!
Titti, please. He's waiting for me.
The second door on the right.
It's an emergency exit. You can take that. Got it? Go.
Close the door! Go close it so no one else comes in. Go!
Titti.
Good morning!
-How's it going? -We've been waiting for you for an hour.
In the meantime, I rewrote the scene, like you asked.
Guys, the director's here.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
NOVEMBER 1ST, 1988 -You're on this couch. You, the other one. -Okay.
You just had sex. You are very tired.
You are sweaty. I want to hear you panting.
Then, line.
-Are you still hungry? -No.
Here, you could just make a gesture.
Without saying the line. We'll figure that out.
-All right. -I am.
Now, you stand up and walk off-screen.
Do you remember you did that scene where you eat and talk on the terrace?
-Yes. -You grab the jar and go back in the room.
I'd also like to rehearse the position when you sit on top of him.
Like this.
What do you say?
The jam thing is very nice, interesting.
The problem is that we only have four jars.
How much jam am I supposed to eat?
So now the problem is the jam?
No, but--
-Do you have a problem with jam? -No problem. I'm an actor.
Then act. I'll show you what to do.
You take the jam with your fingers and slowly bring it to his mouth.
"Impossible loves are those that last forever."
Where did you read that?
I don't remember. But I heard it somewhere.
-Me too. -Giulia, you know…
If that movie hadn't been banned and unbanned, no one would've watched it.
If it weren't for the obscenity charges… Cigarette?
…it wouldn't be a sensation.
-Just for a few kisses. -They weren't just a few kisses.
They did more.
Francesco, I saw you lower your eyes while they kissed.
I don't like watching two men kiss.
I liked it. I even teared up toward the end.
Come on, it's moving. They meet, fall in love,
and maybe never see each other again.
Come on, a movie without an ending.
What the fuck do I do, imagine it? Come on.
This is perfect love.
The one you never forget. It doesn't wear off with time.
What are we supposed to learn from it?
I don't know if there's a lesson. But… it makes you think, right?
Pietro, what do you think?
I really liked it.
I'll go see if our table's ready.
Are you still thinking about the movie?
-No, why? -You've been weird all night.
It's not about the movie.
You once told me
that you got hurt during a protest in Rome.
I did. I broke my arm. So?
I don't know, maybe the movie reminded you of that time.
Why? No one gets hurt in the movie.
Maybe you got nostalgic.
About what?
You were all perky before the movie.
Then at dinner, you didn't say a word.
I didn't like the discussion.
All that stupid nonsense.
What were we supposed to talk about? Politics?
A passion like that is captivating.
-Want to know what I was thinking about? -What?
How could I know it was going to end so bad with him?
We basically didn't do anything.
Disappointing.
Careerist.
He just wanted to fuck the director everyone is talking about right now.
As soon as I figured it out, I left.
And you ran to me for some comfort.
-They only want me because I'm famous now. -What do you care?
Enea or Enea Monte are the same person.
You don't need a shrink to figure that out.
They may overlap, but it's the same person.
What's up with you? You've been weird lately.
You finally noticed. Good.
What's going on?
I didn't know whether to keep it or not.
-Are you…? -I was.
It decided for me.
It left as if he had heard me
and wanted to leave me alone.
Sad, isn't it?
Was it mine?
What? No.
I guess it was some asshole's I met one day.
What do we even care about other people?
Should I get a new haircut?
Huh? Maybe something more classic, or maybe something crazy.
Huh?
ADULT MOVIES
STRICTLY FORBIDDEN TO PEOPLE UNDER 18
INTIMATE EMOTIONS
-One ticket, please. -That'll be 6,000.
-Thanks. -You're welcome.
Hi.
Remember me?
Yeah.
You had a strange nickname, didn't you?
Molotov.
No one's called me that in a long time.
I knew a guy called Enea.
Enea, sure. How is he?
That's what I wanted to ask you.
I never saw him again. I thought he kept coming here.
-He's became a famous director. -Beat it.
Cranky bitch.
-Didn't you have his number? -No, no number or address.
Thanks anyway.
Coming!
I've been ringing for ages!
Sorry.
I was stuck in the editing room. Michele always wants to get his way.
-One day I'll strangle him! -You know him.
I couldn't get you a present. Sorry.
You brought me flowers. They're gorgeous!
Hi.
Leave him alone, he just got back from work.
Enea, hi!
By the way, your boyfriend is a real piece of shit.
Why haven't you given me a part yet?
I just got here, have mercy.
Come on. I have to work. I'm flat broke.
Don't pretend to be poor.
Fifty people could live off what your dad gives you.
So shut up, go talk to Franco.
-You have my number. -Yes.
-Enough. -See you.
-Enough. -She still thinks we're together?
-She's dumb. -Do me a favor.
-Can you get me a bottle of champagne? -Yeah.
-Why are you looking at me like that? -Go!
Excuse me, can you pass me the chocolate, please?
Sure.
Thanks. Hi, I'm Antonio.
-Enea. -Nice to meet you.
The cake is looking good.
Hopefully, it'll come out okay, with all this noise.
Maybe I could make some spoon desserts.
Can you put these in the fridge, please?
-We shouldn't waste space. -Yeah.
So? How do you like my surprise?
He's not a cook, but…
he's a water polo player and dessert enthusiast.
And if I'm not wrong, you have a degree in mechanical engineering.
Yeah, but that was just for my dad.
I'd like you to meet my dearest friend, Enea.
-We just met. -Yeah.
I'm useless here.
You are very organized.
In the kitchen, it's important. I'm methodical.
What matters is the geometry of the elements.
Keeping things clean is very important.
But not so much for hygiene, it's a mental factor.
I get it.
I'm meticulous in life too. I just have to organize everything.
I could really use an organizer in my life.
-Why? What do you do? -I make movies.
Nice! Too bad I don't go to the movies much, though.
So you don't know me?
No, I honestly don't.
I like that.
Enea, can you come for a second?
-Yeah. Excuse me. -It's okay.
He's not my type.
But if he made a move at me, I'd probably be down.
-He's not my type either. -Really?
What would we talk about?
About mechanical engineering.
-Thanks. -I'll get you a glass of wine.
Can we change the music?
I'm exhausted.
My God, they just wouldn't go away.
THE MAN OF DREAMS - FEDERICO FELLINI DIES AFTER 14 DAYS OF AGONY
Such a shame.
How old was he?
"Born in 1920." It's '93.
-So? -You suck at math.
-It's 73. -Seventy-three.
He wasn't too old.
Enea, you're right.
All the success, the awards, the glory in life, and in the end…
this is all you are.
An article in a newspaper.
-Forget about it. -Hey, Enea.
We need to go to the fitting after the interview.
He's not listening to you.
He's in shock.
Okay, but there's the presentation at the movie theater.
-I'll leave you after the interview. -Why?
I have a guy in Milan I see once in a while.
He calls me his "shooting star."
-I pass, I shine, and I disappear. -You never go steady.
Women are fickle.
Women. Not you.
Who is that?
Who?
A familiar face, but I don't know who it was.
Dr. Gherardi, what a pleasure.
Look, I wanted to thank you.
You really saved my mom.
-In a month, you have to bring her back. -Sure.
Sure. I'll bring her as soon as possible.
There are three packs of coffee, I need two,
but I take all three, because I don't want one to be left alone.
I really like that director too.
I saw his last movie, and it was really touching.
-Did you see it? -Can you turn up the volume?
Of course. Clara, can you turn up the volume?
-Sure. -Thanks.
I bawled my eyes out, doctor.
-This movie is really good. -Please.
…are part of my working environment and include all social classes.
There's always a part of me, in my movies.
Always some of my personal experiences.
What I like about your movies is that feelings prevail over everything.
Sometimes it seems that causing emotions is almost a fault, for someone.
SO TIME AND SPACE WON'T GET IN THE WAY
-You haven't been there again? -No, it's been forever.
-Are you sure it was him? -Yeah.
And how was he?
How would I know? I saw him five or six years ago. I don't remember.
Well, coke really gets to you.
It's weird, this is good stuff.
-Here you are. -Hey, man.
I stopped by to say hi.
Good. But I'm not offering you any food. I imagine you two aren't hungry anymore.
-What, are you upset? -No. Why should I be?
We used to do these things together.
In the past, though.
She became as cranky as Rebecca's housekeeper.
-Who's Rebecca? -It's a movie.
But he never went to the movies.
Well, the housekeeper is a great role.
She went to the cleaner's to get the sweaters.
Lorenza and Bruna say hi.
And I say bye to you now.
Well, I'm going.
Here, enjoy the rest. You paid for it.
I guess it's better if I don't show up for a while.
Good luck.
Nora could've done it.
It's her day off, and you should know.
The sweaters could've waited.
-No, I'm wearing this tonight. -Why? Where are you going?
You don't care, but we're having dinner at Alice's tonight.
God, what a pain.
What? What the fuck is wrong with you?
Now you're jealous if I get high with someone else.
It was something you and I used to do. Not with anybody.
It was one time and one bump. Antonio, please!
You want to end up as high as Molotov?
We didn't wait for you. Is that why you're pissed?
If you say that, you don't get it!
Wanna do a bump me and you, before going out?
It'll end badly if you talk to me like that!
-One last line. Why not? -I'm not doing it!
Wait.
Come on, wait.
Let me go. What the fuck are you doing? Huh?
-Let's make up. -No.
You know I'm stronger than you!
-Wait! Oh, God! Wait! -What?
My God.
Enea, what? Hey. What's wrong?
You're such an asshole.
Don't joke with me.
You piss me off when you do that. I'm like this because of you.
You know? Come here.
Hey.
-Do you think Alice is mad now? -Not at all.
She always forgives you anyway.
Since we always do what you say,
look what I'll do.
There you go.
Are you happy now?
Nora will be mad, and now I have to change the sheets.
-I did it because you wanted me to. -Yeah, for once.
We always do what you want. Your head is in another world.
You know how I get when I'm working on a new movie and all that.
It drains all my energy.
By the way, the coke was just a one-time distraction.
I'll be your distraction.
You can go crazy only with me.
Stop. Come on, stop, you're tickling me.
-Ouch! Come on. -Got it? Huh?
Come on.
A piece of that Parmesan and one of that cheese over there, please.
Excuse me.
-That's on me. -That's 18,000 lire.
Enea.
Just cookies and grappa, Titti?
I always follow Garbo's rules.
You recognized me.
I just followed your perfume.
Smells like Nuovo Olimpo. I smelled it when I entered.
They don't make it anymore.
What are you doing here?
I'm editing a movie in a studio nearby.
-You're still the same. -Liar.
-You too. -We're both liars.
You're an asshole.
You never came back to the movie theater. He did.
He came and left a letter for you.
I think I still have it at home.
I live close by.
-Come on in. -May I?
Come in.
Sorry for the mess, but I wasn't expecting anyone.
Sorry. I have a lot of stuff. I keep things everywhere.
But things are just things.
I get attached to people, not things.
Do you like it?
It's needlepoint.
I did it myself. If you want, I could do one for you.
This house was full of stuff.
Even stuff from when I was a dancer and a singer.
I wanted to be on TV, but I couldn't. I wanted to be Raffaella Carrà.
I would've guessed Mina, based on your makeup.
Mina is Mina. She's one of a kind. Raffaella Carrà is also good.
A good dancer.
A singer and a dancer. I had no idea, Titti.
Really? Did you think that I was born a cashier?
Do you think the register was my calling? Have a seat.
You're right. I never asked myself what you really wanted to do,
what your life was like.
This may sound pathetic to you,
but I have been really loved.
I had a lot of suitors.
Of course, I chose the worst guy of all. But that's a classic, another story.
I can't complain, though.
Actually, I'd have loved to have a cat.
But at my age,
if something happens to me, what happens to the cat?
Sorry.
I'm bending your ears with my life, but we're actually here for you.
Come, follow me.
When I left the Nuovo Olimpo,
I put all the things I had on the counter in a bag.
Maybe it's up there, but I don't remember very well.
Maybe here.
Grab that box.
Come, put it here.
Here, take a look, more stuff.
-I'm a hoarder. -Titti, it's not here anymore.
What do you mean it's not here? I'm sure it's here.
I remember it like it was yesterday.
Here it is.
Here. It's this one.
He left it in case you came back, but you never did.
WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU WROTE? "SO TIME AND SPACE WON'T GET IN THE WAY"?
BUT EVERYTHING GOT IN THE WAY.
HERE'S MY PHONE NUMBER. CALL ME. EVEN IF IT'S JUST TO SAY NO.
Titti, your phone?
Over there.
No answer?
Just a fucking recording. The number is no longer valid.
I'm sorry.
I really loved you.
I loved all of you.
I know.
Go away, go.
Go.
Close the door.
Hi, Enea.
What was it that you wrote?
"So time and space won't get in the way."
But everything got in the way.
If we had gone out together that day,
if we had gone to that restaurant I had booked,
if we had chatted and laughed all night over a glass of red wine,
like an ordinary couple,
maybe we'd still be together.
When I got back from the clinic, things were pretty bad,
but I still managed to get to the snack bar.
I tried to run towards the movie theater, but I found myself
in the middle of a clash between the protesters and the police.
I got run over and hurt.
I broke my arm, badly.
It took some time,
but as soon as I could, I came back to find you.
And I'm still here. Waiting.
Your absence ties me even more to you.
I'm already used to your absence.
You were already in my life before we even met.
I thought about you before I even knew what you looked like.
Here's my phone number. Please, call me.
Even if it's just to say no.
Hey, Enea. I didn't hear you come back. Did you get the groceries?
-Did you go to the store? -No, I forgot. Sorry.
One time I ask you to buy four things. Do I have to do everything myself?
You're right. I'm sorry, I'm an asshole.
What's wrong?
Hey.
Hey…
Come here.
What happened?
I'm here. I'm right here. No.
What is it?
Let's go inside.
-Come on, let's go inside. -Help me.
Of course, I'll help you. Come here.
Oh, I've got a strong urge…
I think it'll end badly.
I won't tell you how it ends.
Why? Have you seen it?
We watched it many years ago in a theater,
where they had classics and retrospectives.
Who's "we"?
A friend from university.
He was the real expert.
Someone I know?
No, we lost touch.
He lived in Rome. I didn't.
You know what it's like. One day you're friends, then you're strangers.
Hey.
-Nora left you some food in the oven. -I'm not hungry.
What? Did the meeting go badly?
It was so boring, I don't even want to talk about it.
What is this?
Nothing, just channel surfing.
It will help us.
-Wait, go back a second. -You mean this?
Yeah. I want to see something.
What is it?
Nothing.
Okay.
This movie is amazing.
I know.
I've already seen it three times, but I never get tired of watching it.
She's incredible.
They both are.
Pietro, what's wrong?
Nothing.
It's not the movie, is it?
No.
Do you want to talk about it?
I'm just a little nostalgic.
I always have to drag every word out of you. You never talk to me.
I always feel like your mind is elsewhere.
Why don't you ever take me there?
You're already there.
Also there.
You're going to wear him out.
Ma'am, to release River's energy, he needs to run for an hour every day.
Hi.
You look great! Where are you going?
Rome, for a few hours.
You said you were staying home today.
You didn't have any check-ups or surgeries.
I know. I have to see a patient I operated on a couple of days ago.
Can't your assistants handle it?
No, I'm his surgeon, and I have to check on him.
So you'll be back for lunch?
Not sure. I'll text you.
I'll get changed and come with you. So we can have lunch together.
No, because… I'm already late.
And I don't know how much time the visit will take.
Weren't Laura and the others supposed to come?
Yes, in the afternoon.
Okay. I'll try to be quick then.
-Bye. -Bye.
Why do you often talk about homosexuality in your movies?
I don't talk about it often, it's just that nobody else talks about it at all.
It's the first time you take on a social issue.
Were you afraid of being predictable?
I think the difference is in the way I talk about it,
my vision, my point of view.
-But that makes it an emotional matter. -I always talk about emotions.
Everyone knows it, the public, my regular team: my scriptwriter,
my production manager, and my event planner.
You were the first director to come out publicly.
It took some courage.
When you are in love, it doesn't take much courage.
I like to think love gives you the strength to make everything possible.
And my love is here next to me.
It's clear you're missing something.
-But I have everything. -Yeah. I wouldn't be so sure.
Don't start about having kids again, please.
Hi, everybody.
-Hi. -Hi, Pietro.
-Don't you guys ever work? -You're the one who works too much.
And you know I've tried everything…
-You could've adopted, Giulia. -I have no maternal instinct.
-You have it, and you fully satisfy it. -With whom?
-That's checkmate in two. -Me or him?
Too bad, if you haven't figured it out.
They're not the only ones who don't notice what's under their nose.
I've always noticed everything.
-Why are you paranoid? I was just saying. -How is your patient?
Good. Much better.
I couldn't tell. You look like someone just died.
I'm just tired.
Good thing you're here now to cheer me up.
-Laura's reading our tarot cards. -Her newest nonsense.
It's serious.
What do they say?
There's a big secret in my life.
Really? Are you hiding something from me? Should I worry?
Should I read yours?
-No, thanks. I'm not falling for it. -Come on, just one.
The heart never forgets.
What does that mean?
I have no idea. It's your card.
Do you ever look at others and think they're going to die?
Thankfully, I don't.
All the people we've met and loved, just to lose them.
We may still think about them, but we don't know if they're alive.
That letter really unsettled you.
-It's not the letter. -You've been weird since you told me.
It's weird because it's been so long.
I remember his name, I remember what we said, what we did, but…
sometimes I feel like I don't remember his face anymore.
Sometimes I do.
Do you remember that time on the train, when I looked out the window?
I thought I saw him behind the window of the other train, next to ours.
Maybe it wasn't him, I don't know.
Sorry to interrupt you two lovebirds. All this love.
Alice and I are very close.
Yeah, close in doing nothing, while I keep cleaning up after your party.
-Just so you know, he sees us all dead. -Good.
While you think about that, I'm the only one alive who keeps working.
Wait a minute, we'll help you.
You could've waited for Nora. She's coming tomorrow.
Stop playing dumb. And enough with Nora. Come on.
You never told me about the train.
It looked like a vision.
It's how it is. The more distant the past, the more beautiful it seems.
-Then why am I still thinking about it? -Because you're obsessive.
Maybe it was just your imagination. After so many years.
I don't even remember the people I met yesterday.
This is for the living.
-When did you make that? -I've been working on it all day.
-Stop chatting. Let's eat it. -It's huge.
-It's just us. -No way.
It was for everybody, but the party was a little dead.
-Come on, let's go eat it outside. -You're crazy.
I'm already full.
Nice.
All is ready. I put number candles. NOVEMBER 1ST, 2015
If you prefer, I also have 14 regular candles.
No, it's okay. It's not his birthday, it's his 14th movie.
Great. I'll be here anyway. When should I bring it out?
Five minutes, I think. I'll call you before they start.
-Great, thanks. -Okay, thanks.
Let's meet later for the location scouting.
-Okay. I'll tell the cameraman too. -Good idea.
I just proofread the next scene.
Perfect. Show me later.
Here you are.
Look, you were right. The editing came later, I apologize.
-No problem. -Yeah.
Ready? Is everything as we agreed?
-Yes. -Okay. We're ready, then.
Everything looks good. We're ready.
-Thanks. -Antonio?
Yeah? I'm coming.
-Is this ready? -Yeah, it's just like in the drawing.
So the plunger falls from above.
It lands into this open barrel where there's a very fine glass powder
that spreads upwards, simulating the explosion,
which we'll edit in CGI later on the computer.
I wanted to shoot at 50fps both alone and then with the actors.
-Is it a problem to set it up again? -No, maestro.
We'll have to clean up and add more material. It'll take a few minutes.
-Can we make it fall from higher? -Sure.
-Like this? Higher? -A little higher.
Pull.
I think that's it…
Let's try--Watch out!
Enea! Hey!
-My eyes! -What happened? Come with me!
-What happened? -Get him out of there. Call an ambulance!
Come outside with me.
Dr. Gherardi, we have an emergency.
It's Dr. Renzi's secretary. He'd like you to do a procedure.
Tell her I can't now. I'm too tired.
What?
An accident on set?
Enea Monte, the director?
Wait. Give me the phone.
It's Gherardi.
Can we begin?
Yeah, prepare the field.
-It's intact. I just sutured the cornea. -Okay.
-So the crystalline lens should be fine. -All right.
I'll go talk to them.
-See you later. -Bye.
The family of Mr. Monte?
How is he?
-Fine. He's sleeping now. -Can we see him?
Yes, but I'd rather let him rest.
He had glass powder in both eyes. It's been completely removed.
So his eyesight won't be affected?
It'll be gradual.
This is my business card, for anything else.
You can give that to him.
Thank you.
Call me anytime.
Thank you.
Doctor.
I wanted to tell you…
He's my life.
Don't worry. He'll make a full recovery.
What are you doing here in the dark?
I fixed the vase.
Do you remember it?
Did you eat?
No.
But dinner is ready.
I'm not hungry. I'm exhausted.
How did the surgery go?
Well.
What's he like?
I wouldn't know, he's all bandaged.
I only saw him in the OR, and then while he was sleeping.
Did you talk to his family?
Yes.
What's his partner like?
How do you know he has a partner?
Internet.
Is he good-looking?
Yeah. He wanted to stay for the night, even though it wasn't necessary.
He loves him very much.
It's not the type of procedure that requires overnight care.
I gave him a sedative, so… He'll sleep peacefully all night.
He's peaceful because he knows his companion is by his side.
I would've stayed too for you.
Even if there wasn't a chair.
You wouldn't.
What are you saying?
You wouldn't do that for anyone, I don't think.
I would if it were necessary. In his case, it's not.
It's not about necessity.
It's about love.
What? Are you mad at me?
Are you crying?
I can't help it.
I get emotional when I see
someone loving another person more than their own life.
Sorry, Pietro, I got emotional.
I'll warm up some food.
Did it hurt when I removed the sutures?
No, it was fine, thanks.
Your voice sounds very familiar.
It sounds a little muffled, though.
I gave you an anesthetic. It must be that.
I could almost see your profile.
I could even describe it.
I didn't notice that.
I have a very good imagination.
It's part of your job.
-I'll let you rest. -Doctor.
Do you go to the movies?
Rarely.
-And what do you do? -I heal people's eyes.
Your fans' eyes too.
You should be grateful for that.
When can I go home?
Today, if you promise to keep the bandages on for a week.
I'll send a nurse to check on you.
I'd love for you to come visit one day too.
Is that too much?
No.
When I have time, I'll come visit you, I promise.
Bye.
Titti.
I think about you a lot, you know?
But I feel guilty.
I should have been there for you more, left you alone less.
I'm not alone.
I'm a loner.
I was always enough for myself.
I never missed anything that had to do with you.
Every award you got.
Every set you've worked on.
Your life with Antonio.
I was even there when you were alone and sad.
Enea, the people we loved are always with us.
They're there even if you can't see them.
You may say, "You and I barely saw each other."
That doesn't mean anything.
The point is not how often, but how.
How you recognize each other.
It's about the intensity of your bond.
You make me talk like a philosopher.
Good morning.
This is Dr. Gherardi.
-I wanted to check on you. -Doctor, what a pleasure.
I'm fine. In the dark, but I feel good.
I can hear it in your voice.
The nurse keeps me updated,
but I wanted to hear it from you to be sure.
Your nurse is fantastic. She's very capable and nice.
But didn't you promise you'd come visit me too?
-Or did I imagine it? -No.
I did say I'd come visit you.
Why don't you come now?
Well, I'm at the clinic now.
I don't want to impose.
Okay, I'll come as soon as I can.
If you tell me your address, I'll reach you.
I'll ask Antonio to send it to you right now.
Okay.
What do you see?
You know what I see, it's your house.
That's why I ask.
This house means a lot to me. It's full of memories.
I had to fight for it.
Sometimes I miss seeing things I've already seen a thousand times.
That won't be for much longer.
You know, Pietro is a recurring name in my life.
I met another Pietro when I was a student.
A friend?
More than that.
What's wrong?
It's just a weird feeling.
Are you happy the doctor's here? The drinks are ready.
-Come on, let's go inside. -Here, I'll get Enea.
Pietro. Your phone.
Hello?
Yes, he's here, just a second. Sure. It's Enea Monte.
-Hello? -You didn't tell me you weren't coming.
-Hello? -You didn't tell me you weren't coming. I thought I'd see you here.
I'm sorry. The most important thing is
that you're okay. Now you can choose to see what you want, when you want.
Invite him to dinner on Saturday. Yes!
Is that the doctor?
Yes. Sorry, doctor, Antonio and Alice are here to help with dinner.
Did your wife pick up the phone?
Yes, I'm here with my wife, yeah.
-She's a huge fan, as I told you. -Put her on, so I can say hi.
Sure.
He wants to say hi.
Hello?
Yes. It's so nice to meet you. Really.
Sorry I didn't introduce myself, I was a little starstruck.
We should meet in person one day.
About that, I was just telling my husband you should come over for dinner.
Would this Saturday work for you?
I'd be so happy.
Would the doctor be happy too?
Of course he'd be happy.
I'll be there, then.
We'll text you the address. See you on Saturday.
Have a good night, bye.
He's coming on Saturday!
Dinner at the doctor's on Saturday. His wife loves me, so she invited me.
You're terrible.
You'd flirt with anyone.
You're a slut.
Dinner at the doctor's on Saturday, honey.
Me? No way.
What's the doctor like?
What do you think? He's a man.
-A handsome man. -Don't play along, Nora.
-She takes after him. -A connoisseur.
If you're so curious, look him up online.
I tried. I only found his publications, not a single picture.
-You must be Giulia. -Come in.
They're gorgeous, thank you.
I'm sorry your partner couldn't make it.
He had to go to Venice to visit his dad.
Of course. Maybe next time.
Come meet our friends.
We've watched all your movies together.
Yes, and we loved them all. I'm Gaia, lovely to meet you.
My pleasure. You're making me blush. Let's be informal.
I'm Francesco. Don't be too flattered, we've also been quite critical.
I can imagine. Otherwise, it's no fun.
Hi, I'm Massimo, and this is my wife Laura.
It's a pleasure to meet you. We are all very excited.
-Thank you. -And here's your doctor.
I'm glad you could come.
Doctor, I can finally see you.
-Let's have a drink. -Yes.
-Good idea. -Thanks.
Well, some people can't stand when the spark fades.
Every couple goes through it, eventually.
It depends on where you put that spark.
-Everybody channels it differently. -Yeah, maybe into a hobby.
Or into another person.
This is their private decision.
There's no privacy in a relationship.
Yes, but who hasn't had their own secret garden?
A place just for themselves? I think everybody has one.
If it's a secret, why talk about it? It spoils it, it ruins the magic, right?
-Let's head to the sofas. -Sure.
After all these years together, I think affection is what saved us.
That's just a romantic word for routine, Laura.
Enea, forgive her. My wife is very cynical.
I have you to thank for that.
-As for us, we're very close. Aren't we? -Yeah.
-What's wrong with affection, anyway? -Nothing.
I think it alleviates the passing of time. It may even give it meaning.
Come on, tell us the truth. You put your secrets in your movies, don't you?
Well, not always.
Sometimes, telling a story is just a way to remember a feeling.
If real life is what actually inspires your movies, then I have a question.
Why didn't the two guys in your first movie ever meet again?
If you really want to know,
he actually had an accident during a protest.
He never made it to our meeting.
I found out years later. That's why it's not in the movie.
It happens.
That's life.
I could call a cab.
I'd rather walk.
It was very nice to meet you, Giulia.
You too.
I mean it.
Pietro.
Go.
All my life…
I've wanted you to look at me like that.
The way you looked at him tonight.
Go!
Go!
Being forgotten really hurts.
We still haven't forgotten each other.
Think of me, once in a while.
Bye, Enea.
Bye, Pietro.
it's all been decided…
whether you get to look down on others
or have to look up to others.
There are only those two kinds of people.
Hey!
Can't you talk?
RYO SUZAKI 3RD YEAR STUDENT, SENOMON TECH HIGH
Remember what I said?
We will destroy you if you don't join us.
KOHEI AMAGAI 3RD YEAR STUDENT, SENOMON TECH HIGH
AMAHISA SABO (SABOTEN) 3RD YEAR STUDENT, SENOMON TECH HIGH
Let's bounce.
REIJI HIMURO 3RD YEAR STUDENT, KAMASAKA HIGH
KAZUSHI IWATSUGU (GANDHI) 3RD YEAR STUDENT, KAMASAKA HIGH
Give it to them!
SHOJI SAMEOKA 3RD YEAR STUDENT, EBARA HIGH
JIN KAZAMI (FUJIN) 3RD YEAR STUDENT, EBARA HIGH
MASATO UENARI (RAIJIN) 3RD YEAR STUDENT, EBARA HIGH
FUJIO HANAOKA 3RD YEAR STUDENT, OYA HIGH
SUZURAN BOYS HIGH SCHOOL
Excuse me!
Is Rao around?
Who the hell are you?
I'm Fujio Hanaoka, a senior at Oya High.
Oya High?
Do you have any idea where you are?
I do!
This is Suzuran, right?
He's mine.
-Is that the best you can do, Binzo? -Let me handle him!
He's mine!
Bastard!
Who the hell are you?
Want to fight, Binzo?
Who the hell are you?
Nice. I like it!
Suzuran is the best!
You're pretty freaking good, dude.
You're pretty badass yourself.
Looks like fun!
Hey!
Let me join in.
Stay out of this, Magoroku!
Hey!
That's enough, Binzo.
Back off.
Move.
I'm Mashii, a senior here.
You're from Oya High, right?
Oya High?
They are the guys who rumbled with the Housen baldies.
Right.
You came all the way here,
so what the hell do you want?
He came to meet Rao.
Our Rao is so popular,
everybody's waiting in line just to shake his hand.
You can't just cut in line like this.
You need to take a number and wait your turn.
What?
Take a number…
-Where can I get one? -Hey!
Not bad…
but I think Doroki is better.
You're good.
That was your number.
Fujio Hanaoka, I've got my eye on you.
Glad to know.
I got my number, huh?
Suzuran is hilarious.
SUZURAN
Hey, jerk!
What the heck are you looking at?
Rao?
What are you mumbling?
You're not from around here, are you?
Where are you from? Kansuke!
Yes?
Get lost!
What the hell is your problem?
Do you think you can toy with Housen, the Killer Corps?
What makes you think you can just show up here?
Speak up!
Hey, it's been a while.
I was just passing by, so I thought I'd drop in.
I think it's okay.
It's not like he's a stranger.
YUKEN ODAJIMA 3RD YEAR STUDENT, HOUSEN ACADEMY
Right?
Hey, who the heck is that?
MONJI TOKUYAMA (MONJI) 2ND YEAR STUDENT, HOUSEN ACADEMY
Remember when I told you we rumbled with Oya High from SWORD
when you were in the hospital after your bike accident?
He's Fujio Hanaoka from that Oya High.
-Excuse me! -What?
By the way, before Fujio came here,
he went to Suzuran to challenge them.
No way!
Holy crap! Are you for real?
You're so nuts, it's incredible!
No, I'm not that great.
-That wasn't a compliment. -Don't tell me you went to see Rao.
Right, I did. Then this guy Mashii told me
to take a number and get in line if I wanted to meet Rao.
That sounds like Mercy.
-Hey, Sabakan! -Yes, sir!
Fill this moron in!
Roger!
Hey!
SUZURAN
Suzuran has no leader.
They are divided into several factions.
There are not even ten members in the smallest faction,
the Rao Faction.
The Rao Faction is that small?
They don't want any flunkies.
I see.
JUST SIX MEMBERS!?
First, there's Kamui Ito, a sophomore who specializes in spy work.
His trademark is his mask.
KAMUI ITO 2ND YEAR STUDENT, SUZURAN HIGH
Kansuke Seta is one of the best sophomore brawlers.
KANSUKE SETA 2ND YEAR STUDENT, SUZURAN HIGH
Both are on my kill list.
Then there's the senior, Magoroku Yamaguchi.
He always chews gum and used to be a lone wolf.
After fighting Rao, he was named "Rao's Toughest Bodyguard."
He gave me a hell of a kick.
And the guy who let Fujio leave unharmed is
the senior, Takehiko Mashii.
His nickname is "Mercy."
He's always calm and collected.
He is Rao Faction's steadfast second in command.
He's number two?
He didn't get there because he's a good fighter.
Suzuran is a school for morons, so he doesn't belong,
but he's got a head on his shoulders.
Another senior is
Kozo Miyauchi.
He's the toughest guy in Suzuran.
No matter how much of a beating he takes,
he gets back up like a zombie.
That's why he is called "Binzo."
Right! I fought him!
I hit him hard a ton of times,
but he just laughed it off.
When it comes to the best fighters,
that guy is only second to Rao.
-Right, Shidaken? -What? The hell he is!
Can't believe he would ever follow anyone.
You have a guy like him too, right?
-We do? -Lastly…
There are many legends about
the most powerful man of Suzuran.
Mario Misaki, aka Rao.
"Mario"?
Rao's name is Mario? Fujio!
I'm telling you for your own good.
Don't fight Rao. What?
We are nothing in comparison to that guy.
He's even a better fighter and a better man than Sachio,
who absolutely hates to lose.
Seriously?
That makes me want to meet him even more…
Say, where is Satchi anyway?
Sachio is…
Well…
Something came up and he went abroad.
What? He went abroad?
His mom is really sick--
Sabakan!
You don't need to give him all the details!
I'm sorry!
I see.
Damn it!
What the hell was with that damn Oya High dude!
Hey.
Why did you let him go?
This makes Suzuran look weak.
Shut up!
Let me ask you this then.
Any of you lame nerds have the balls to enter Oya High
or even Housen alone?
He's the only guy to try since Sachio Ueda from Housen did.
He deserves respect for it.
He came to see Rao, so he's our guest!
We will handle this.
-Are you for real? -Kamui!
Yes, sir! Say something, man!
Fujio Hanaoka of Oya High…
Keep an eye on him.
Roger.
One more thing.
Watch the other factions too.
We can't let our guard down here at Suzuran!
Seriously?
You went to Housen and Suzuran alone?
When will you learn?
Didn't I tell you never to go to Suzuran?
But to see Rao--
And don't ever try to see Rao!
Listen!
There are many terrifying legends about the monster Rao of Suzuran!
Monster?
So,
what are the legends about this Rao dude?
Hey! It's time for Jamuo's lecture on hooligan history!
SHOHEI NAKAOKA 1ST YEAR STUDENT, OYA HIGH
DAI NAKAGOSHI 2ND YEAR STUDENT, OYA HIGH
It's lecture time!
TSUJI 3RD YEAR STUDENT, OYA HIGH SHIBAMAN 3RD YEAR STUDENT, OYA HIGH
Let's hear it!
Okay! Listen up!
Legend number one:
The Kurosaki High punch fest!
Legend number two:
The highway closure incident!
Legend number three. This is the big one!
The destruction of Pub Ruby.
When Rao was a freshman,
he was at Pub Ruby on the outskirts of Toaru City.
He got stinking drunk and told a guy,
"Hey, drink!"
"What?"
"Are you refusing my offer?" Slam!
He got into a huge fight with a guy at the bar!
The bartender tried to stop it and other customers got involved!
It was a huge brawl!
Lots of people were hurt and the guy at the bar was half dead!
And Pub Ruby…
never opened its doors again.
Liar! No freshman can get into a bar!
At any rate, there are tons of legends about Rao!
There are heaps of them.
Wait!
Then you make a legend too, Fujio!
-Don't you dare! -Quit saying that!
When you tell us to stop, it has the opposite effect.
This is pointless! Tsukasa!
Where's Tsukasa?
What? He's not here yet?
TSUKASA TAKAJO 3RD YEAR STUDENT, OYA HIGH
Damn, I'm exhausted.
Shit.
I am so freaking late.
What?
Hey.
YOSUKE TODOROKI 3RD YEAR STUDENT, OYA HIGH
Nice work this morning.
Since Murayama dropped out,
all the schools in SWORD are vying for control.
Knocking us out is the fastest way.
What's wrong?
I saw some dudes from Senomon over there.
Senomon?
Even from there, huh?
We'll be in trouble if we don't stay alert.
Hey.
Where are you going?
This is a hell of a group we've got here.
Himuro and Gandhi, leaders of the massive Kamasaka High.
Unbelievable.
I never thought I'd work with you guys.
From Ebara High, it's Kazami and Uenari, aka Fujin and Raijin.
-As well as Sameoka. -Hey!
Nobody lays a hand on Yosuke Todoroki.
That dude is ours. I got it.
We are working with both Kama High and Ebara High.
Total control of SWORD is in our grasp.
-Let's get this brawl started. -Right.
We've got our troops and weapons ready.
Weapons? That's so typical of Kama High.
-Who asked you? Jerk! -Screw you!
-Bring it on! -Enough!
Get us more.
-You don't trust we can do it, huh? -What's the use in trusting you guys?
Power must be so complete that everyone is brought to their knees before you.
You can't give anyone the slightest chance.
All you give them… is fear.
Just shut up and stick with me.
I'll show you what it's like at the top.
TO FUJIO
Fujio!
What's up?
Sachio told me to give you this letter.
What? A letter in this day and age?
He's a stickler for this kind of thing.
"Dear Fujio Hanaoka,
I'm sure you've heard,
but when you're reading this,"
I won't be in Toaru City.
It's a family issue.
I may not be back for a long time.
The longer I'm gone, the more worried I am.
It's times like this that quarrels usually happen.
Fujio, if anything happens with Housen, I want you to help them.
Naturally, we will help you if you also need it.
Let's get together when I return.
And please,
don't go after Rao.
"Don't even try."
"Sachio Ueda."
You'll never get rich with your head in the clouds.
You know, Jamuo…
Yes?
Since I was born a man,
"I've got to be the greatest,"
is what I've always thought.
But that may not be what a truly strong man is.
That guy never changes his mind.
So you want to have him fight Fujio?
Right…
but I want to know about Rao first.
That's so like you.
Also, I was pretty surprised…
that this guy is your pal.
Hey. How's it going?
Do you understand?
-Well, I guess it makes sense. -Can you help us out?
Wait. Hold on a sec.
Can you clear something up?
How did you become pals?
I never told you?
We're fishing pals.
What?
It's true.
I never expected you guys to have fishing in common.
Well, it was pure coincidence.
We ran into each other at tackle shops and the river, so then we just hung out.
He doesn't talk and I don't talk.
We just sit in silence and fish.
It's just… you know, relaxing.
Unbelievable.
Look.
Seriously?
Whether you believe it or not is your choice.
-Seriously? -Seriously.
No way.
How long are you going to look?
Give it back!
Here. That's the place.
If you want to know about Rao,
the best person to see is Takehiko Mashii, aka Mercy.
-Do you want me to get him? -No.
Let me do this.
It's good manners.
Yes?
Who are you?
I'm Takajo of Oya High.
Oya High?
I want to know about Rao.
Don't be ridiculous. Buzz off.
I'm a close friend of Fujio Hanaoka who went to your school the other day.
Wait there a sec.
I don't have to tell you a thing about Rao.
You're snooping around yourself.
Your people are nosing around SWORD.
You know it, right?
You're good.
Why do you want to know?
There are many legends about the monster Rao,
but most legends are exaggerations.
Isn't that right?
Is he someone my friend should fight with?
Is he a man worthy of it?
That's what I want to know.
Hey, that shit is bad for you.
SENOMON TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL
Okay.
But I'm broke right now.
Okay.
Hey, don't be like that, Mom!
Okay.
I know.
I'll come to see you on my next break.
Thanks.
AKABOSHI STEEL WORKS
Appreciate it, Motoaki. Thanks for driving us here.
No problem. I come to Toaru City sometimes for deliveries.
Thanks, Motoaki. Drop by the school and see us again.
Sure thing! Later!
Hey! Shut it slowly!
-This way. -It's those guys!
Mom. I'll call you back.
Bye.
Not again, Mom!
Saboten?
KASUMI HOUSE
Look.
That's Rao of Suzuran, the guy you've been wanting to meet.
Really?
Isn't this an orphanage?
That's right.
This is where Rao lives.
Mario Misaki, aka Rao.
With his umbilical cord still attached,
he was wrapped in a flimsy towel,
placed in a shopping bag,
and was left at the doorstep of this orphanage.
When he was little,
he cried a lot and didn't talk much.
One day, there was a fight at the orphanage.
I said cut it out!
Mario broke it up.
He discovered in that fight that he was very strong.
That's when his real fight started.
Everything he has done
has been to protect his little brothers and sisters.
Their big, strong brother, Mario, is always there to help them,
so they started calling him Rao.
Then what about the legend about Pub Ruby?
There was a boy two years younger than him.
His father used to beat him.
-So he was brought here. -Let me go!
His father found out he was here
and tried to drag him out.
Let me go!
The staff was able to stop him.
Mom…
But who would know when his abusive dad might come back?
To make sure he never beat the boy again,
Rao went out looking for him
and found out he was at Pub Ruby.
Don't you ever come back!
That's the truth behind that legend.
Understand? Scumbag!
I'm sorry.
I didn't know anything about the real truth.
Hey! Fujio!
Rao!
What?
Aren't you…
I'm Fujio Hanaoka of Oya High.
Be my friend.
What?
You're awesome.
You're totally awesome!
Now I know what the Housen guys meant.
Please!
Be my friend!
But you're-- Okay?
-Okay? -What's with you?
Hey, shut up already!
You shut up!
-Hey! Shidaken! -Hey.
Sorry for calling out of the blue.
What do you want?
Now, just chill.
Let's just go inside. Okay?
This way.
Make way, you.
Move it.
We want to crush those big-shot assholes at Oya High
who have been bossing everybody around.
Housen and Oya fought, but things haven't been settled yet, right?
So…
you'll give me this money if Housen joins up with you?
Good deal, right?
Fine.
What?
What did you say?
You became friends with Rao?
-You liar! There's no way! -I'm serious! I did!
Yes, it's the truth.
Seriously? That Rao dude is that horrible monster!
No, he's not!
That guy is a real man.
He's a total defender of justice!
-Right! -And this stuff tastes awesome!
-Motoaki, give me seconds! -Sure thing!
-Give me seconds too! -Eat up! Here's a clean plate.
-Can you afford to treat us? -No problem.
There's this guy Zen at my workplace. A friend of his ordered too much.
A ton of it was delivered and he asked if anyone wanted it,
so I thought of you morons here.
-Thanks, man! -This stuff is great, Motoaki!
My pleasure! Look at you guys, chowing down on yakisoba.
Do you want some too?
I saw some Kama High dudes from the bus this morning.
Kama High? What are they doing here?
Isn't Kama High on the other side of Tendo Mountain?
-Motoaki, I think I'll have some. -Okay!
-Me too. -Okay.
Have a seat.
-Aren't you going to eat, Tsukasa? -No.
You eat some too. Let me cook instead.
It's okay. I've got a weak stomach.
What?
Well…
It's way past the expiration date.
Are you nuts or something?
-This shit is rotten, you jerk! -You just said it was really good!
Senomon and Kama High, huh?
So, the leader of this alliance is…
You?
I'm Amagai of Senomon Tech.
Let me know if it's not enough.
Name your price.
You guys,
don't try to push Housen around.
Saboten.
You sure have sunk low since the last time we met.
Don't ever show your face around me again.
Right.
Maybe I should give you a warning.
You'll be sorry if you mess with Oya High.
Later.
Damn it!
Are you sure you want to just let him leave?
Unless he's silenced, he could leak this.
Clean this up yourself!
Come on!
-Where's my car? -It's waiting.
Something has been bothering me.
You controlled Nami High, so why did you come to Senomon?
And you even work for the spoiled son of the Amagai Group president.
-You could-- -It's none of your business.
Keep your nose out of it.
Has my son been useful?
Kohei,
congratulations on transferring to Senomon Tech High School.
You're making fun of me?
It's my third transfer this year.
I was able to get my son transferred to your new school this time.
-Long time no see. -Right.
That's Suzaki from Nami High!
He's wearing our uniform!
Hey.
We will take control of this school.
SENOMON TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL
From now on, Amagai runs the show here.
Understand?
I'm Amagai.
From now on, you guys are my tools.
Thanks to you, Kohei, my son is very happy.
My whole family thanks you for it.
Sometimes, like old times--
Mr. Suzaki.
We humans are destined to live in a hierarchical world.
Either at the top or bottom.
I'm a man who's at the top.
Yes, sir.
What are your plans for tomorrow?
Oya territory.
Odajima, your phone is ringing.
Don't talk to me now!
I'm sorry!
Shit.
Damn it, that jerk Odajima isn't answering.
Hey.
Hey, man.
I told you never to show your face again.
Why don't you tell me what you mean by that? What?
You're good.
No wonder you're expected to lead Housen next. You're strong.
Thank you.
Shidaken called.
Ouch!
So, Kama High and Senomon have been snooping around Oya High?
Right.
I can't help thinking that this doesn't bode well.
Well, whoever tries something, I'll welcome them with this.
Fujio!
I'm serious about this.
The way Oya High is now, they will do whatever you say.
That means we could lose depending on what you do.
Not everything can be solved with fists.
Don't forget that Oya High isn't just you.
-Get him! -Hold him!
-Don't give up! -Get going, Sabakan!
Hey! You punks!
You guys…
Listen up,
Shidaken called me yesterday, but he doesn't answer now when I call.
Does anyone know anything?
Who was the last person who saw Shidaken yesterday?
That's probably me.
Did he say anything?
No, he didn't.
What the hell is this?
Hey!
What's with this bullshit traffic jam?
Was there an accident or what?
Holy shit! Run for your lives!
Run!
Nice! I like it!
It never felt so good to stroll through Oya territory before!
We're coming for you, Todoroki!
It's Oya High hunting time.
I'll stick with Suzaki. Saboten.
You work with Kama High and Ebara High.
Crush every last one of them!
Roger.
Okay! Let's kick some ass!
They're coming!
-I'm sorry. -You better be!
-Man… -What's taking so long?
That yakisoba has messed with my stomach.
You too, Kiyoshi?
Is it true… that chicks don't like mohawks?
How should I know?
This mohawk is why chicks don't dig me, right?
-Who cares? My stomach hurts! -Why does it hurt?
-Doesn't yours hurt? -No.
How…
Hey! Are you okay, man?
Well, if it isn't Yasukiyo.
Gandhi!
It's time to hunt Oya High scum!
Hey. Isn't that Fujin?
Good morning, everybody!
Take a swim!
Time for you scum to take the plunge!
Senomon!
-Are you okay? -Stop them!
Wait, Nakaoka! Don't chase them!
Shit.
We should have been a little more careful.
And it looks like it isn't just Senomon Tech.
Jamuo. Yes?
Fujio and I will handle this.
Look for your chance to escape.
But-- The way things look, they've got the whole town covered.
The way things look, they've got the whole town covered.
They've got a huge gang here.
Here we go!
Tsuji and Shibaman.
Found you!
It's just the two bodyguards.
Hey, bodyguards!
Where is your damn leader, Todoroki?
How should I know?
We're not always with him.
Then we will kill you instead.
Get them.
Listen.
Figure out what's up and regroup our forces.
Got it!
It's Nakagoshi and Nakaoka of the Chuchu Faction.
Shut the hell up, Saboten!
How dare you Senomon losers pull this crap on Oya High!
This won't turn out well for you!
I've always hated your guts.
Nakagoshi! Are you okay?
Fujio Hanaoka!
Looks like I won first prize.
Are you sure it's a win?
That's for me to decide.
That hurts!
I hate assholes who bring weapons to a fight.
Winning is what counts. That's all.
Suzaki of Nami High?
Pull yourself together! Let's go!
What are you doing, Kiyoshi?
If we all get our asses kicked,
who will get revenge?
Don't be stupid!
You have friends besides me at Oya High!
Just open up!
-Bring them with you! -Open up!
There they are!
-Go, you guys! -Kiyoshi!
Just go!
Go! Yasushi!
It's all in your hands now!
Kiyoshi!
Get them!
Hey, man.
Looks like you lost.
Damn you!
It's not over yet.
Stop wasting time on this chump.
Sorry, but we couldn't finish off the Chuchu Faction.
Gandhi couldn't either.
What?
Don't give me that crap.
What about Fujio Hanaoka?
I don't know.
-Bring him. -Yes, sir.
We will use him as bait to lure out those morons.
Then we won't have to look for them.
OYA HIGH SCHOOL
Fujio!
You made it out okay?
Thanks to Motoaki, I got away.
Where's Tsukasa?
Damn it!
It wasn't just Senomon.
Kama High and Ebara High worked with them.
Alone, they were no big deal.
But there were heaps of them.
And the others?
Nakagoshi sacrificed himself for me.
The same goes for Kiyoshi.
Also…
I can't get hold of Tsuji or Shiba.
And Doroki?
What about Todoroki?
Hey! Haven't you found Todoroki yet?
No. We have looked everywhere but can't find him.
Hurry up and find him, damn it!
Yes, sir!
Hey!
You're looking for me?
Fujio, what should we do?
Maybe I wasn't meant to be…
the leader of Oya High.
What?
What are you talking about?
If it had been Satchi…
or Tsukasa…
this wouldn't have happened.
Don't forget that Oya High isn't just you.
They've got the whole town covered.
Figure out what's up and regroup our forces.
You're the leader of Oya High!
I'm sorry.
Give me some time by myself.
Hey.
Hey, you had some good friends.
But that stuff is all nonsense.
You grow weak when you've got something to protect.
You don't need friends to be strong.
What's so funny?
If you were captured,
I bet nobody would come to rescue you.
We will finish off Oya High tomorrow.
Hey Suzaki,
does he have some kind of dirt on you?
He must.
Otherwise, why would you work for him?
Seriously? So you've known him since you were kids?
Suzaki's dad had a company, but it went bankrupt.
My dad's company bought it, so now he's our chauffeur.
He depends on us for money.
So that guy's been my tool since way back.
Your tool, huh?
There are some Kiri High guys outside.
Saboten.
-Summon the tools. -Right. Got it.
Thanks.
Keep the change.
Do your job.
Am I a tool?
I thought we could be friends.
Everyone who works for me basically wants money. Even you.
-I-- -I can't trust a friend!
All I need are tools.
We could lose depending on what you do.
Not everything can be solved with fists.
Hey.
Let's drop out of this.
This three-school alliance is total crap.
It's too late for that now!
You two just want to fight Todoroki, right?
Todoroki isn't what he used to be.
He's Todoroki of Oya High now.
I see. So that's what it is.
This sure is a roundabout way to get to me.
-I see you're ready to fight. -However…
If I win this fight, you drop out of that alliance.
-I don't know… -Okay!
-It's a deal. -Hey, Sameoka!
It's a good deal.
I'll be the judge.
Okay.
It's a deal.
Okay.
By the way, was it you guys who beat up Tsuji and Shibaman?
You're dead.
Getting hospitalized from a fight?
Talk about being immature!
I'm sorry.
The kid in the ICU is still in a coma.
He doesn't have an ID either, so there's nothing we can do.
Hey! You lie back down!
Sorry,
but that guy in a coma
might be a friend of mine.
Where are you going?
I'll go after them alone.
Wait a little longer!
Forget that! I can't stand just sitting here anymore!
Fujio!
Fujio, where did you go?
Sorry, guys.
Doroki.
Was it those alliance jerks?
Ebara High dropped out.
They won't fight us again.
Next time, come to me directly.
You know…
you have changed.
Right.
You may be right.
Now…
I've got friends to protect.
Seriously.
My leaders had a huge influence on me.
Hello? Who's this?
Hey! Kiyoshi!
Did the doctor check you out?
Okay.
What?
Shidaken of Housen?
Yasushi, give me the phone.
Todoroki here. What's with Shidaken?
Okay. Where?
It's Tsukasa.
Tsukasa! Are you all right?
That's a good question.
I don't think he is.
Why you…
It's all over for the former top dogs, Oya High.
Screw you.
Tomorrow,
bring all your people who ran away today.
We will be waiting.
I will!
You can count on it.
Are we going then?
Yes.
All right!
Let's kick their asses!
-All right! -All right!
Even with Ebara High out, nothing's really changed.
We are all that's left of our forces.
It would be stupid to attack them head-on.
Right now…
the best thing to do is figure out how to rescue Tsukasa.
Hey!
Sounds like your friends will come and save you tomorrow.
Nice.
That is if they can even get this far.
How can we know?
What?
How can we know unless we try?
I doubt Tsukasa even wants us to come save him.
Hey!
They won't come to save me.
-What? -What?
They will come to kill you.
We are simple people at Oya High.
No matter the situation,
we fight because it's all we can do now.
Just the will to fight won't cut it this time.
You need to use your head!
Todoroki.
It will be easier with Ebara High out.
That's all we needed.
Thank you.
What is this all about?
Does this mean you don't need me anymore?
Of course not.
It means that for a friend, I'm willing to swallow my pride.
Please.
Will you help us?
We became friends through fighting.
You guys here are not our only comrades!
Did you…
Since they have built an alliance…
then we will show them what a real alliance is.
OYA HIGH SCHOOL
Hey, Jinjin.
Don't call me that.
Don't get the wrong idea.
They beat up our Shidaken too.
Besides…
Well, how do I put this?
If Sachio was here,
I'm sure he would do the same thing.
How is Shidaken?
He came out of the coma this morning,
but he's in really bad shape.
What happened? Your face is in pretty bad shape too.
It's nothing!
Your friend has been captured, right?
-Make way! -Yes, sir!
Let's do this!
-Yes! -Yes!
-It's party time! -Yes!
What?
Ebara High is not coming?
That doesn't matter.
All that's left are their dregs.
Hey!
They're here.
-Let's go! -Yes! Let's do this!
SWORD's going to be ours!
Bring it on!
Why the hell is Housen here?
Those fricking baldies.
Fujio.
Give the signal.
Let's go, you assholes!
Crush them!
Yasushi!
Let's do this!
Welcome, everybody.
Your friend is in the gym.
Get to the gym if you can!
Let's go!
Fujio!
There are too many here. Take another route!
-Let's go! -Roger!
They're here!
Out of the way!
Yes! Go for it!
It's the Housen locomotive!
Hey.
Bring your troops and come to Senomon.
If you don't want your other arm busted, then do your job!
Go! Get out there, damn it!
-How much longer will you run, Gandhi? -Shut up, moron!
Who are you calling a moron?
-What? Hey! -Hey!
Shit!
-Shit! What's going on? -This is screwed up!
Pull!
Hey!
You guys! Find another way in!
Are you okay?
Watch out!
You better watch your head.
Looks like they led us into a trap.
They totally duped us!
There's no end to them!
Greetings!
The Housen Killer Corps is here.
What took so long?
Don't be like that.
There's plenty more work to be done.
Let's go!
Don't mess with Oya High!
Kill them!
Let's go!
Fujio! Leave this to us!
I'm here for revenge!
Those dudes…
We have arrived.
We're almost there, Tsukasa!
Wait!
Hey! Odajima!
Saboten.
That must be Amagai of Senomon.
Suzuran!
What is Suzuran doing here?
Rao…
Hey, Suzuran! This is none of your business!
Yes, it is.
Fujio is my friend.
Understand?
So the Rao Faction of Suzuran is in this fight too.
Seriously?
You must be morons!
What can just six people do?
You know what? Just me alone would be enough!
Kill them all now.
Let's get this rumble rolling!
What are you looking at?
Ko!
Hey Suzaki!
Beat the crap out of everyone who gets inside.
Hey.
Do your job.
Hey.
Leave this to us.
You attack the castle.
Fujio!
Get in there!
-Let's go! -Let's go!
Tsukasa!
First, rescue Tsukasa. Right!
You're the one who beat Tsukasa, right?
Right.
Odajima!
I got this. Go!
What a bunch of losers.
Both you and Oya High
can go to hell.
Are you okay?
Man, I think all my bones are broken.
I'll take care of him.
Your fight is with me.
So…
You're the one who beat Shidaken, right?
I forgot.
Todoroki…
Take care of the rest.
Shit, here we go.
-Looks like we got them all here. -Right.
Hey, did you even fight?
You better believe it!
I hadn't punched someone in a long time.
Do it.
Seriously. I just got back home.
No way! What are you doing here?
Has it already started inside? Yes!
Get him!
SACHIO UEDA 3RD YEAR STUDENT, HOUSEN ACADEMY
Who are these guys?
The enemy's reinforcements.
I see.
I've got dibs…
on kicking your ass.
Hey! Looks like you're getting your asses kicked.
You're a disgrace to Toaru City.
What is Suzuran doing here?
Is that the best the four emperors of Housen can do? Binzo!
Chew on this and take a break.
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you really think you could beat me?
Let go of me!
Hurts, doesn't it?
Fooled you!
You're under arrest.
Be more careful who you fight.
I'll make sure you get the bed next to Shidaken.
Apologize while you're there.
Hey! Suzaki!
What's taking you so long? Finish him off!
Just two of them left, huh?
What? Don't be stupid!
I've still got lots of troops!
We have finished up.
I think we went a bit overboard.
They all ran off.
That's awesome.
Suzuran are not the only ones!
Housen is here too!
Damn, that fight ate up a lot of calories.
This kind of thing is fun once in a while, right?
Hey.
You're in a fight, man.
Why the hell isn't he answering?
Hey!
Don't be so lame!
You guys have lost!
Hey, you guys! Go and get them!
I paid you, so do your job!
Do your job, damn it!
Hey!
It's not over yet.
Suzaki…
All right.
Then I'll end it.
This Senomon dude is pretty good.
We've got tons like him at our school.
Seriously…
In their condition, how can they keep that up?
Man… why is Suzaki fighting for that jerk?
To Suzaki…
he's more than that.
Hey Ryo!
Ko!
What's with the bat?
Those guys who bullied you,
I beat the crap out of them.
You did?
He won…
He won! I won!
You saw it!
I won!
You saw that, right?
Why did you do it?
Do I need a reason?
We're friends, after all.
I won!
The hell you did!
Hey…
The next one decides it.
I won't lose.
I'll get strong.
I'll get strong and protect you, Ko!
Cool! We will both become the greatest!
Yes! Let's take in the view from the top!
The greatest…
will be Senomon!
I'm sorry.
I won't let you be the greatest.
I lost?
I lost?
No, that can't be.
Fujio!
Why did you do that?
What's your problem?
You know you shouldn't use…
that kind of thing!
We're going to take in that view…
that belongs to us.
I've always stuck with you because I believed we would,
but you don't remember, do you?
I'm sorry…
I couldn't succeed.
Oya High…
truly is tough.
From now on…
we will be tools of Oya High.
What are you talking about?
You lost once.
That's all.
We fought to see who's the greatest,
but who cares who's on top and who isn't?
You've got friends around you who will fight for you.
Isn't that enough?
Looking down from the sky,
you can see we are all down here together.
Hey…
Let's start over again.
Will you be my friend?
Ko…
That's so stupid.
We lost this time,
but I swear we will destroy you.
Ryo and I, together.
Damn it, don't cry.
I'm sorry.
Jinkawa!
Okay!
I'm beat.
You…
You're a tough one.
Let's do this again.
Okay! Nice work!
-We are leaving! -Yes, sir!
You had me worried, Fujio!
Damn it.
We can't even see the sky.
You and I… Let's start over again.
Do you know what Rao said?
That was the first time anyone ever asked him to be friends.
He doesn't look like it, but that made him happy.
Tell your boss I said thanks.
Will do.
Fujio.
Sachio?
What?
Sachio!
Hey! It's Sachio!
The second I get back, I'm already busy.
Hey! Satchi!
Hey.
You're kidding.
What is Suzuran doing here?
You told me not to, but I just had to meet Rao.
And now we're friends!
It's been a while, Sachio.
Rao!
Let's fight sometime soon.
Me too.
I want another chance.
Yes! All three of us can fight!
It won't cause trouble for anyone.
Sachio!
Welcome home. All right, let's all go back.
This isn't expired either, is it? I've already eaten it.
You know, you haven't changed a bit.
-Is it expired? -No! It's just fine!
What did you just say?
Meiwa Girls High School invited us to a singles mixer!
Nakaoka and I were invited
but there are four more spots!
Yes! Let's decide this way!
There are four aces in this deck of cards.
Whoever finds an ace
gets to go to the mixer!
Look! Go get it! Go!
There it is! Go!
We are stupid morons who are savage and crude.
We are good-for-nothings covered in bandages.
Some people probably mock us.
Some people probably even flip the bird and spit on us.
Even so, I don't care.
We just want to be who we are.
We will never be untrue to ourselves
and we will live life the way we want to.
What about you?
Hey!
He says he wants to fight you again.
Our Fujio is very popular, so you need to take a number.
Waking up after 50 glorious years, it was all merely a dream.
Truly, everything is but an empty dream. - Kantan, a Noh play
WELCOME TO KAMON VILLAGE
Hey, Yuu, you're getting your ass kicked.
Come on.
Come on!
What? Did you land one?
Come on, man. The face is out of bounds.
All right.
They're here.
Hello, everyone!
-Hey. -Hey.
Careful, Mr. Sakashita.
This is quite a sight, Mayor Ohashi.
All the garbage in this area is gathered here.
Hello!
We separate the reusable waste here.
I see.
It's our job to reduce the waste that goes to the landfill.
Of course.
If we are awarded next year's subsidy,
we plan to expand the site to other nearby mountains.
-All those mountains? -Yes.
Misaki.
Should we go and see the mayor soon?
Okay.
Hey.
Is it always like that for you?
Well…
that's basically bullying.
I only just got here, so I don't really know.
But I wouldn't accept getting smacked around.
I don't accept it either.
Yeah, I guess not.
It's gonna be hell until I pay off my debts.
I haven't seen Kokichi perform Noh for a year.
I wish he would make up with the mayor already.
How long is he going to stay here?
I bet there'll be another incident someday.
Why does the mayor even let him live here?
No idea.
Welcome home.
By the way,
can I get next month's money early?
Huh? I gave you money last week.
No, you don't understand.
Everything was going great at first.
Then this weird old lady sat beside me, and I lost everything.
I'll pay you back next week.
What's with that look?
What?
Don't treat your mother like this! I said I'd pay you back!
MARUOKA
You lot aren't done.
Come on. Hurry up.
It's gonna be morning soon.
Maru.
-What's up? -Hey.
Another big haul today, huh?
Here.
-Aren't you a little short? -Nope.
Hey.
So, did you borrow money from Maruoka too?
It wasn't me who borrowed it.
The mayor, everyone… They all know about this, right?
Wow.
This village is the pits.
Look at that face.
Hey, look this way.
Why are you being difficult?
-Hey. -Okay.
Good work.
Thanks.
-Thank you. -Good job.
Hey, Yuu.
How's your mom?
-Fine. -Good.
Tell her to take it easy with the gambling.
You want out of this village too, right?
-Thank you. -All right.
Nice work.
Thanks.
Yuu.
What's up?
It's just this noise.
Huh?
I don't hear anything.
What?
You're freaking me out.
-…over the mountain next year. -Wow, really?
-Yep. -That's so much.
-Really? -Right?
True.
Is that Yuu?
It is you. It's been a while.
Don't you remember Misaki?
She's back after ten years.
She's gonna be working here.
PR, right? Publicity and stuff.
Good to see you.
All right, let's have a welcome party at Yosuke's place.
-Great. -Good idea.
How about you?
Nah, I don't--
Why not join in for a change?
You two used to get along.
You should come.
-Let's go, Misaki. -Sure.
FOOD AND DRINK NAKAI
You look great these days, Misaki!
Am I right?
-Not at all. -Honestly.
I always had my eye on you, Misaki.
Sure. You had a girlfriend though.
Well, that wasn't serious.
Did you find a guy?
Not telling.
Come on. Don't be like that.
Yosuke, you must be happy to have your daughter back.
Yes. I owe it to you.
You too, Keiichi.
So, Keiichi.
What are you gonna do after high school?
Well…
Speak up. Be a man!
-Don't tease him. -Sorry.
I'd get out of this village if I were you.
What are you saying? Nobody would take you.
What's so funny?
Anyway, I was amazed.
I didn't think the facility would be so big.
What do people think?
Well, of course, they understand.
There were problems at first, but it's fine now.
There were problems at first, but it's fine now. I see.
That's good.
Come on. Why are you sipping on your juice?
This isn't a funeral.
Toru, you shouldn't force him to drink.
As if that's a problem here.
Right?
Don't worry. That one's on me.
Yuu.
You faced problems too.
But you're happy to have work now.
Aren't you?
Yes.
Drink up.
Are you okay?
He made you drink a lot.
It's fine.
Yuu, something about you has changed.
Yuu, something about you has changed. I was surprised.
How have you been?
Well…
All right.
Why did you return?
Why?
There's nothing here.
And there was nothing in Tokyo.
What?
How about you?
Why are you still here?
What do you mean?
You could've left.
You had options, right?
There are no options.
Not for me.
DX CHALLENGE
BUTTON MASH
YOU LOSE
Damn it!
What the hell is this?
Hey! Something isn't right here!
Someone must be messing with the machine.
Shut up.
What a racket.
-What are you looking at? -I'm not looking.
This is annoying.
What a pain in the ass. Hey, what are you looking at?
I dropped them. Damn it!
-What are you looking at? -Hey, help!
Excuse me.
Yuu, it's been a while.
You should get Kimie to stop drinking.
She doesn't look well these days.
She's your only family.
She needs your support.
Easy for you to say. You left.
Here we go.
By the way,
Misaki's back, right?
You used to be close.
Let's hang out. It's been ages.
WELCOME TO KAMON VILLAGE
It's as if it's been there forever.
It's right above the shrine!
Even the people who opposed the plans to build it say nothing now that it's here.
What do they think when they see this?
It's weird.
Misaki!
-It's been a while. -How have you been?
I've been good.
Thanks for coming.
All right, let's get started.
I wonder if I can do it.
I'm totally rusty now.
That's not true at all.
Yuu, want to get into Noh again?
Not really.
Do you still teach?
Young people in the village don't do Noh anymore.
It makes me sad,
but it's like that these days.
By the way, are you two coming to the festival?
By the way, are you two coming to the festival? I want to. Let's go together.
I want to. Let's go together.
I'll pass.
You should come.
It'll make you want to try Noh again.
I'm home.
Kokichi.
It's been a while, Mom.
How's Mom doing?
You saw her.
She's riddled with cancer, but she still has her wits.
I see.
How are finances?
Good question.
It's tight every year.
But we should be okay with next year's subsidy for the waste facility.
Shusaku.
Is a thing like that really necessary?
There's more to the world than just what's necessary.
SACRED LIGHT
When I was little,
it scared me to see this.
Everyone with the same face,
walking in the same direction.
Unquestioning.
It's unnatural
as if it's not of this world.
You haven't seen Noh in a long time, huh?
Right.
I'd rather not sit here.
-Got some nerve. -What is this?
It's okay.
Sleep if you're tired.
Noh, you see, makes you face your inner self.
Rather than try to understand, you should respond in your own way.
That interpretation is never wrong.
Hey!
Kimie Katayama.
Yuu.
I know you're there.
There you are.
Hey, Yuu.
Thanks again.
Don't mind me.
PROOF OF LOAN 3 MILLION YEN
Kimie.
You didn't want Yuu to know.
Your son works at a dump day in and day out.
Your son works at a dump day in and day out. How will you deal with this loan?
You couldn't repay this in a lifetime.
I'll work to repay it.
Yuu.
I sympathize with you.
It's your useless mother's debt. You did nothing wrong.
But you know, I'm trying to make a living too.
You understand?
-Let's go. -All right.
-That's good. -Thank you.
Oh, Yuu.
Can I ask you something?
Look at this.
To improve familiarity with this facility, we're discussing having a children's tour.
To improve familiarity with this facility, we're discussing having a children's tour. KAMON VILLAGE ENVIRONMENTAL CENTER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TOUR
I was thinking.
I'd like to ask you to be the guide.
-Me? -Yeah.
You used to like public speaking.
Nah, that's not like Yuu at all.
I can do it.
You're the supervisor, Toru. Just be big and strong.
And you look so tough. Won't the kids be scared?
That's for sure.
Come on.
There are plenty of reasons it can't be Yuu.
Am I right?
Well? Are you interested?
-I haven't done this before, so-- -Hey.
Come on now.
You know he's a criminal's son, right?
Toru.
It's true, isn't it?
It'll be a problem if that gets out later.
-The past isn't important. -You must know too, Misaki.
We had a hard time because of his situation.
Right?
Huh?
What's with that look?
-You got something to say? -Stop, Toru.
Away he goes.
He ran away.
Yuu is the wrong choice for this.
Yuu!
Hey, Yuu.
Can I have a ride?
The rain is so bad.
Toru hasn't changed at all since the old days.
He shouldn't talk like that.
Hey, don't get the wrong idea.
Sorry, but I don't need your pity.
It's nothing like that.
Hey, do you have time after this?
What?
I want to give you something.
Yikes!
I'm home.
Welcome back.
Yuu?
Hey.
Come in.
Jacket.
Thanks.
You haven't been here in a long time.
It was nice back then.
Everything was green. The vegetables were great.
We would all practice Noh on our days off.
But everything changed.
Here.
What is it?
A mask.
Mask?
I told you I don't do Noh.
You know, masks have the power to soothe the heart.
Put this on when you think you might explode.
Now, what shall we do?
Thoughts?
It shouldn't be me.
It's just like they said.
You know about my dad, right?
That's why I chose you.
You did nothing wrong.
So, why are you treated like that?
Yuu.
You're the same as I was.
You've always been fighting alone.
I understand how you feel.
Everyone bullies you.
Nobody comes to help you.
You suffered in silence all alone, right?
In that place.
It's okay.
I'm here for you now.
So, here at the Kamon Village Environmental Center,
we want to recycle everyone's household waste
to help the whole village address environmental issues as one.
In the waste facility's first year, 2,000 tons of garbage went into the landfill.
Thanks to everyone's efforts, we can gradually lessen that amount.
We call this giant trash can "the pit."
We churn the garbage so it burns easily, then move it to the incinerator.
The incinerator burns garbage throughout the night while you're asleep.
Awesome!
I'll drop off the pass.
Hey, what's up?
Hey.
You're getting the hang of it, huh?
Well…
Maybe it's your expression or something, but you seem more masculine.
Shut up.
What's that?
Well…
I guess it's my turn now.
What a loser you are.
Acting cool in front of little kids.
Nobody will have cared if that's all it took to wipe the slate clean.
See you tonight.
"The man taught me a lot about garbage."
"Sometimes my dad doesn't separate the garbage. Next time, I'll tell him."
This is great. You're so popular.
Stop it.
Now Mayor Ohashi is talking
about having a TV special made.
He sees it as a big chance to teach people about the village.
TV?
Maybe you'll become a celebrity.
I'll pass.
Upon the pillow of Kantan
Where I laid my head
Where I laid my head I had this dream And now I have awoken!
I had this dream And now I have awoken!
What?
Kantan.
The mask I gave you is from that play.
Kantan?
What's it about?
There's a young man
who stays at an inn.
He sleeps on the "pillow of Kantan"
and wakes up as an emperor.
Fifty years pass,
and he spends every day reveling and enjoying life as the emperor.
But then he woke up
and was in the inn all along.
Then he realizes
that life itself is nothing more than a dream.
A dream?
Somehow…
I feel alive right now.
Oh?
In Tokyo…
I tried so hard to keep up with everyone.
But nothing went right.
People just said I was good at making them angry.
Every day, I wondered why I was alive.
But now…
I feel like I'm being told I deserve to be alive.
Good.
Sorry.
I need to go.
Okay.
The first elementary school tour last month was a great success.
Next month's schedule is already filling up.
Furthermore, there are plans to produce a TV special next weekend.
Our employee Yuu Katayama is expected to be featured.
Thank you.
Any questions?
Please.
Should we be worried about water pollution from the garbage?
No need for concern.
We are taking precautionary measures, following safety guidelines.
Anyone else?
Go ahead.
I think Katayama is unacceptable.
Someone with a criminal family member shouldn't represent us and the facility.
Right?
Definitely not on TV.
Misaki would be much nicer, being a girl and all.
She's pretty.
Yeah, Misaki's better.
Yuu is not responsible for his family's crimes.
He's working hard for our company now.
You all must know this.
Of course I understand that there are concerns.
Nevertheless, we specifically chose Yuu Katayama.
We provide a place for people who have had a hard time in society.
That's how we want to promote our village.
Nice work.
Thank you.
Misaki!
Want to get a drink?
Sorry. I have to write the proposal.
Seriously?
You know, you're defending him a lot.
How come?
Yuu is really trying to change. You should support him too.
Don't be ridiculous.
He's always the same, no matter what. He isn't gonna change.
That's your opinion.
It's confirmed.
They'll be producing the TV special next week.
They'll be paying us a visit soon. You show them around.
-Me? -You.
People from all over Japan will watch.
It could be a hit.
Oh, also…
quit the night job.
What?
I'll tell Maruoka.
It'll cause trouble for us if that comes out later.
Really?
Yuu.
Now is the time to change your life.
Prove yourself to those who look down on you.
I'll take on the task.
Makes you feel alive, huh?
This is our guide, Yuu Katayama.
-It's a pleasure. -The pleasure is all mine.
This way.
Picture-perfect.
Oh, hello there!
What's this?
This is where we separate the reusable waste
not just from Kamon Village but from other nearby communities too.
Hey.
-Nothing to see here. -Now, now.
I'm terribly sorry.
Some employees have special circumstances.
But our company's strength is in employing them on an equal basis.
We'll go that way next.
Sorry.
This isn't a zoo!
Toru.
Hey, Yuu.
You're one of us.
-Come on, Mr. Ono. -You too!
Sure.
-That's right. -It's nicely done.
Sounds good.
I'll take some photos later.
Thank you.
-Cute! -This is great.
Let's just use this.
Toru?
What's going on?
I was in the neighborhood.
Let's chat.
Thank you.
-See you next time. -See you then.
Sorry, Misaki. I'm done now.
Do you mind? We're busy.
Well?
This is a crime, you know. What's so good about him?
Did you make him do this?
Come on. Don't pin the blame on me.
He came to me. He wanted this work.
I guess you see yourself in him.
What?
You see…
I heard it from your dad.
He told me you left your job because of mental illness.
No, it's okay.
It can happen to anyone.
Stop it.
Misaki…
You know,
I've always had feelings for you.
Be with me.
We'll leave the village.
I'll make you happy.
Stop it.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna force you.
Stop!
No! Stop!
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?
I told her all about your bad sides.
What?
What is it?
Wanna kill people who piss you off, like your old man did?
He got mad after everyone left him when he opposed the waste facility.
Isn't that stupid, Misaki?
Playing the victim.
You piss me off.
Toru, calm down.
Hey. Fight back.
I told you to fight back.
Come on!
Bring it!
Why?
Why did it have to be you?
Stop it!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Fight back!
Please. Please stop.
Misaki!
Wake up!
Run! Get inside!
-No! -Hurry, run!
Stop it! You'll kill him!
You…
this village doesn't need you.
What the hell is he doing?
YUU KATAYAMA That stupid boy is hopeless.
I bet he got wasted again.
What happened to your face?
Sorry.
I fell.
-Can we cover this with makeup? -Yes.
This all depends on you.
I'm relying on you.
Got it.
Yes? Oh, good to see you, Mr. Sakashita.
The time has come.
Well, I'm excited, but there are some concerns as well.
-Don't worry. -Thank you. I'm glad you came.
There's still time, so please relax in the waiting room.
Oh, I see.
-Well, best of luck. -Thank you.
Yuu Katayama is here.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
Kokichi.
-It's about to start. -Oh?
The village of Kamon carries the beauty of every season
and has a strong Noh tradition spanning over 500 years.
Kamon Village is home to this elegant, enigmatic Japanese scenery and tradition,
and its continued protection is…
-Yes. -Understood.
-Thank you for coming today. -Thank you.
-Over here. -Thank you.
Ten seconds to go.
We're live in four, three…
WELCOME TO KAMON VILLAGE
Oh. Hey, it has started.
Here we go.
Today's feature is on Kamon Village.
Even on a weekday, the village is bustling.
Introducing the village to us today is Kamon Village's young star,
Yuu Katayama.
Please, go ahead.
-Thank you. -It's Yuu!
He's looking good.
He scrubbed up nicely.
-He's so cool. -Nice one.
I'm pleased to say we now have nearly one million visitors annually.
One million? That's amazing.
It's really one of the prefecture's top destinations.
-Thank you. -Yuu!
-Sorry, that's my mother. -Your mother?
What a charming woman. Thank you for coming!
Sorry. Hello!
-Yuu is working very hard. -Thank you.
-Ready to begin? -Yes.
-Please. -Thank you.
Once every year, a Noh festival continues…
There's a lot of hype.
Do you regret leaving?
Be quiet.
Still…
he's worked hard for this.
What has supported the village through these times
What has supported the village through these times is this waste management facility, isn't that right?
Yes.
Wow, it's big.
Kamon Village Environmental Center is a savior for the entire prefecture.
So, how do they handle waste?
Please watch this summary.
SEPARATING WASTE BY HAND
It's me! Look!
He's glaring at the camera!
You can't make that face.
It's so grand and impressive.
Feels very reassuring.
Thank you very much.
I work at the center, where we take 30% of the prefecture's garbage and…
What about your brother's son?
Any news on the police search?
Yeah, well…
He's always causing problems, so nothing would surprise me.
But I can't help worrying.
At any rate, you explain it so well, Mr. Katayama.
Oh no, you're too kind.
We've reached the end. Now, Mr. Katayama,
could you look into the camera and give us a brief parting message?
All right.
In Kamon Village, we respect diversity. We will keep looking to the future.
This is a village where tradition and the environment coexist.
We must work towards building a greener society
We must work towards building a greener society and curbing climate change.
Everyone, please visit Kamon Village.
I believe this village can offer ideas to improve your life.
Okay, cut!
All good.
-Ah, thank you so much. -Thank you.
You're great.
-Thank you. -Thanks.
Good job.
I saw you, Yuu!
It was the best.
Wow, Shusaku.
You really are lucky
to have these young people livening up the place.
No, Mr. Sakashita. It's thanks to your help.
Looks like the next mayor has been chosen.
Right, Yuu?
Oh, no.
I'm sure Yuu could easily succeed Shusaku.
I'm so proud of my son!
Mom, you're drunk.
Of course, I had a successor of my own.
Where has that boy gone?
He was probably jealous of you, Yuu.
Still, it's just wonderful
Still, it's just wonderful that the village Fumi protected lives on for future generations.
that the village Fumi protected lives on for future generations.
Isn't it?
She's happy inside.
Yes, right.
Yuu really gave it everything this year.
However, Misaki is an unsung hero.
Thanks to her unfailing guidance, we have the Yuu of today.
I may even have them join the Ohashi household.
How about it, Yosuke?
Please do!
-What? -That was great.
-Is that okay? -Please, go ahead.
Cheers!
-I don't feel good. -Careful, Kimie!
All right.
-You okay? -Yeah.
Okay. We made it.
There.
Misaki.
Yeah?
Thank you.
What are you saying?
You did the hard work.
Who'd have thought Garbage Town would be such a sensation?
I was surprised. He used it to his advantage.
Even the mayor is desperate for Fumi's approval.
But Kokichi was always her favorite son, right?
She ended up like that because Kokichi left.
Messy, isn't it?
Good morning, everyone.
There are two tours today.
We'll do our best to stay out of your way.
-Okay. -Okay.
-Getting the hang of it, Keiichi? -Yeah.
Yuu, when you appeared on TV,
this kid's eyes totally lit up.
You were cool.
-I didn't recognize you. -Stop it.
Thanks.
Oh, just a second.
I have something to tell you.
I'm in the clear.
I'm leaving the job next month.
I might help with my parents' work back home.
I see.
That's great.
You know, Yuu,
you shouldn't take on too much either.
I still prefer you now to before.
I get it.
Sorry.
Yes?
You can go home after this.
Okay.
Red.
Yellow.
Pink.
INFECTIOUS WASTE
Huh?
WATER QUALITY INSPECTION RESULTS
What is this?
We exceeded the limits, thanks to those doing the extra dumping.
This will be a nightmare if it gets out.
You're right.
Do something about it.
What?
-Me? -Yes, you.
I left this to you, so you must be able to sort it out.
-Yeah, but-- -Yuu.
Everything that's piled up will disappear.
Understand?
HANDLING GENERAL AND INDUSTRIAL WASTE
FIGURE THREE: BIOHAZARD LABEL
-Morning. -Good morning.
-Oh, Kokichi. -Huh?
One moment.
What's this?
Is that Keiichi?
What's wrong?
There's something I need to tell you.
Keeping busy, huh?
It's been a while.
What's with that hair?
I preferred your old lazy style.
Stop that.
-Is something up? -Huh?
Nah, I'm just on patrol.
Toru is still missing, after all.
How about you?
Is something up with you?
No, not really.
Hey, Misaki.
-It's been a while. -It sure has.
Is something wrong?
Oh, a few things.
Let's practice again one day.
Sure.
Later.
Detain them!
What?
I see. I'll be right there.
-The truth's out. -Huh?
Yuu.
Did you know?
Me?
How would I know?
Keiichi.
Keiichi made the report.
He did well.
I can't accept wrongdoings.
Good job, Keiichi.
Nice work.
Fix this.
Thank you for gathering here today.
This matter was exposed thanks to this young man's brave actions.
We're very proud of him.
Mr. Nakai, could you give us a few words?
Well, this news came truly out of nowhere.
This site has become a hotbed for crime after we lovingly built it up,
and we deeply regret this.
We will cooperate with the investigation…
There's bound to be a cover-up.
Yeah, for sure.
What do you mean?
Just like ten years ago.
After a brief outcry, it'll be as if nothing happened.
-Ten years ago? -Yeah.
Wait, when was it that you left?
There was an opposition movement when this place was planned.
Those involved came up against most of the village.
One ended up killing someone who had been bullying him for it.
In the end, he burned the house down with himself inside.
It all got wrapped up in a flash without any investigation.
I couldn't do anything.
Yuu, you're my hero.
Thank you.
Mr. Sakashita.
Sorry to bother you. I'll make the donation payment tomorrow.
Yes?
What?
Wait, please. Mr. Sakashita.
Mr. Sakashita!
What a situation.
What?
Well, it's about your beloved missing son.
-We have a lead. -Now isn't the time for that.
The illegal dumping.
Toru was involved, wasn't he?
What would I know about that?
Do you really think you can continue keeping a lid on this stench?
You…
wouldn't understand how I feel.
What?
Hey, Yuu.
What is it? I don't want you coming here.
It's not looking good.
It's a loss of income for me, so it affects us both.
Why are you here?
It was never like this with Toru.
You didn't blab, right?
Why would I?
Anyway, smooth this over.
Sell me out, and I'll kill you.
Is that a threat?
Are you an idiot?
Did you forget you're famous now?
You're a criminal.
-Yuu, are you okay? -I'm fine.
Get out.
-Yuu-- -Get out!
Chief!
Forensics, here! Take photos!
Everyone, stop digging and stand by!
-Cordon it off. -Roger!
I knew he'd show up.
Excuse me, Mr. Katayama.
You must be busy, but may I ask a question?
What is it?
Well, your father led the opposition movement against the waste facility, correct?
As you promote the facility, how do you feel about that?
What do you mean?
Yes, well,
what's your opinion on your father's crimes?
What the hell do you know?
-Yuu! -Let me go!
-It's insulting! -Tell me how that feels--
Get out of my face!
-Get lost! -Why?
Yuu…
I know…
that you saved my sister.
Thanks.
Keiichi.
I want to ask you a favor.
Yes.
I'll be there in 30 minutes. I want to speak to the press.
Yes.
Thank you.
All right.
Where are we going?
I want you to talk to the reporters.
Say you saw Toru Ohashi doing bad stuff, and some scary guys came to take him away.
But I didn't see that--
I know you didn't!
This never would've happened if you had kept quiet.
Keiichi, come on.
I'm your hero, aren't I?
But I don't like lying.
Keiichi.
That guy is garbage. He tried to assault your sister.
People like that shouldn't be alive.
Right, Keiichi?
You want to be a hero, don't you?
-I don't like this. -What are you doing?
Look out!
Hey!
Keiichi…
Keiichi?
Keiichi?
Keiichi!
Keiichi!
I'm sorry, Keiichi!
I'm sorry…
The story of Kamon Village's illegal waste dumping is developing rapidly.
Today, as police were digging for evidence at the landfill site,
a body, believed to be male, was found.
The police say that due to decomposition, the identity is unconfirmed.
This is being investigated as a dead body dumping case.
Police are working to confirm the identity and cause of death.
They are also investigating the possible involvement
They are also investigating the possible involvement of facility employees and gang members arrested for illegal dumping two days ago.

Going forward,
the question of whether the two cases may be connected…
Keiichi…
is always talking about you at home.
Things like, "Yuu talked to me today."
"Yuu ate lunch with me."
Yuu this. Yuu that.
In the future…
keep being his hero, okay?
Where are you going?
Wait.
I'll go too.
-You can't. -Why not?
Yuu…
this village needs you.
You have to go on saving people.
What are you saying?
I'm the one who was saved by you, Misaki.
At least a little…
even someone like me deserves to be alive.
You made me feel that way.
I'm sorry I couldn't…
make you happy.
What a bastard.
What the hell are you doing?
This village doesn't need you.
Misaki.
That hurts, you know.
Too late.
Mayor Ohashi.
Yes?
I came to talk to you.
I have something to say too.
I heard from Kokichi earlier.
Apparently, Toru's phone
had a lot of videos and photos on it.
They include photos of you carrying out illegal dumping.
I see.
There was also a video of Toru assaulting Misaki.
You two did it.
Yes.
Fine.
That doesn't matter. It's what I expected.
I've had to hush up his incidents so many times.
That burden is gone.
That's the only evidence.
I'll come up with some lie.
Position is what matters.
If you fall, it's hard to get your place back.
You get it, right? Being the culprit.
Was it this easy with my dad?
What makes you say that?
Answer me.
Your old man.
Honestly, I forget.
Nah, I'm sorry.
But that's how much I was thinking of the village.
The village needs sacrifices.
That's how it's survived.
I'm thankful for your dad.
So now, shall we sacrifice Misaki this time around?
She did it all by herself.
We leave it at that.
How about it? I'll sort out the rest.
You and I can rebuild the village together.
Well, Yuu?
You're garbage.
What?
This village deserves to disappear.
EXPLORING KAMON VILLAGE
Where are they?
I can't see! There's too much dust.
Wait.
I can't see them!
Come on!
Clara!
-Leave it, get in. -I have 3,000 vaccines in the trunk!
Go! Go!
Yeah!
-You all right? -Yeah.
Ever see them this close?
On their territory, but never in this area.
Are you doing anything?
Nothing. You?
Why do you keep doing these trips?
Can't stand being without me now?
Seriously. It's too dangerous. You should stop.
See that?
It's all I have of my dad.
I grew up here with him. This is my country.
So I don't care if it's dangerous.
And you, why are you hiding here?
9 MONTHS EARLIER
Senior officers, junior officers and privates
are involved in this unprecedented military coup.
The president who was almost ousted last month has just left the country.
This coup puts an end to the government that had overthrown the monarchy.
-Hello? -Any news on the boat?
We leave tomorrow morning. I'll pick you up.
-You at home? -No, at the office.
-Disposing of explosives. -Weren't they seized?
Hey, my job is demolishing buildings.
I didn't give all my gear to the guys blowing up the country.
Giving them your explosives won't change a thing.
At least I won't have blood on my hands.
Where are you?
Fred, can you hear me?
I'm in the middle of the mess.
I need to expatriate a client. Not easy with this rioting.
Be careful.
You too.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Sir? The plane is ready.
Good.
What is she doing here?
This is for you.
Thank you.
Wait for me outside. I'm coming.
Are you going to tell me about oil wells again?
Look, it's Fred.
Is she your client?
I thought you'd left.
My boat is in eight hours. Last night working, then a new life.
So it's for sure? No regrets?
No, it's too messy here. I'd rather go back to Paris.
It's a shame, you know? Messy means more money to be made.
But you know that already. Right?
What's going on?
Where's the owner?
Search the place. You, with me.
Stay here.
Bodyguards?
How are you, sir?
Go by the pool.
Where are the others?
I can make you a rich man.
It's too late.
Let's split up.
You are attacking police officers.
Do you realize what you're doing?
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on, open the doors.
-It's beautiful. -Yeah.
I don't want to go live in Paris. I want to stay here with my friends.
I know, but we've explained.
We can't stay. It's too dangerous.
-You read your messages? -No.
Hey!
-Uncle? -There's my favorite niece!
-The prettiest girl! -I missed you.
Give me a kiss. Another one!
Hey, Fred.
-Ready to leave? -Are you?
Right behind you. I told you when you married him.
You can't take one brother without the other.
Thirsty?
Come here.
We need to talk.
What do you want?
Where are the explosives?
I buried them. I kept some, but nothing dangerous.
Enough for a safe?
A tip from my client before he got killed. There's more of it, in a safe.
He got killed? What are you suggesting?
-We go get it. -No.
-Hey, Alex! -No, no, no!
I've got nothing. I'm screwed if I go back like this.
Do I go back to driving trucks?
You need this as much as I do.
Do you know what they do to thieves here?
Hey, you're my brother.
If there were any risk, would I even suggest it?
I need you.
You're a pain in the ass.
THE WAGES OF FEAR
Hey. See you at home.
Okay? Go on.
-Hey, Uncle! -How are you, sweetie?
I'm okay.
Were you with your girlfriend?
What? I don't have a girlfriend.
You do. The doctor.
No. She's a friend, not my girlfriend.
Let's stop there for today.
Go play.
What's this about bandits?
-What bandits? -Don't. Everybody's talking about it.
You brought them here with your shitty job.
That's what pays, and we need the money.
To do what?
Get out of here.
My husband, your brother, got arrested instead of you.
-I know that. I know. -No.
You killed cops. Did you forget?
Let me get you across the border.
You're both wanted here. It's dangerous.
Do what you want. I won't leave without him.
-Come on! -Malya!
And the rest.
That's the rate for cop killers.
It's fine if you don't want it.
I'll teach you discipline, dumbass!
Everyone on the ground, now!
On the ground!
Get on the ground, now!
Come here.
With the trouble you caused, you owe us at least ten fights.
I won't fight again. Find someone else.
If you won't fight anymore, what good are you?
Okay, you decide.
But if I were you, I wouldn't close my eyes.
Good night.
Cops.
Cops killed your client?
Crooked cops. What difference does it make?
If you'd told me, I wouldn't be here. And you know it.
Hey, trust me.
Come on.
It's here.
You got this?
Let me work.
I'll check outside.
Don't move!
Turn around.
It was during the attack yesterday. They hit a gas pocket.
It's getting dangerous for locals.
Get some sleep. You've been up all night. Go get some rest.
See you later.
Here.
One million, as agreed.
As head of security, you have to save this well.
Any news?
Our fears are confirmed.
Beneath the pocket, a larger second one stretches under the village.
If the fire spreads, the wall separating the two pockets will give way.
Only 100 kilos of nitroglycerin will extinguish the fire in the well
and prevent the second pocket from exploding.
If it blows up, we're both dead, clear? Are you sure of your team?
We got the go-ahead from the NGO rep.
She'll do anything to save the villagers.
As for the other two, you've read the file.
We'll make an offer they can't refuse.
You have just over 24 hours to put it out.
Can I count on you?
Helicopter!
Fred, some people from the oil company want to see us.
It's been a while. How are you?
Fine.
We've met. Anne Marchand.
I'm the company representative for this well.
What do you want?
We need you. To put the fire out.
I could blow or piss on it, but that's it.
A gas pocket under the well is fueling the fire.
The only way is to blow it up. We have a stock of nitro for that.
The only way is to blow it up. We have a stock of nitro for that. We need you to drive a truckload of it here.
Where is it?
500 miles away. At a solar power plant.
You want me to drive 500 miles in a truck full of explosives?
Given where the nitro is, couldn't you find a decent driver?
They all refused.
You'll understand if I refuse too.
We know your brother's in prison.
I can get him out.
We need an explosives expert.
Let me explain.
You drive the truck. Your brother will handle the nitro.
Gauthier's team will provide security in the occupied territories.
You'll get one million on arrival at the well.
And we'll get you out of the country. All four of you.
All four of us?
Is this shit serious? Do what they're asking.
Bring back my husband. Bring Alex home.
Let me handle this, okay? Leave it to me.
We'll take you home.
-How will you get him released? -We're handling it.
And how will you get the nitro into the well?
The company's specialist drilling team will take care of it.
Don't worry.
And we won't be alone.
I believe you know each other.
They're coming with us. They'll be our guides.
I'll check the chopper.
Why the hell are you here?
We've been driving this route for months.
Nobody knows it better.
We're not transporting meds.
Do you know the road?
No. So quit acting protective over me.
What exactly is your relationship?
We fuck sometimes. When we have time.
Okay. Can you put it aside or is it going to be a problem?
There is no problem.
All right. I'll handle the drilling team.
Wear this.
I told you to put it on.
Why don't you fly the nitro?
Too unstable. With the altitude variation, it'd explode.
Fred. Look.
This is the military zone. The bandits are here. My men will take care of them.
The bandits are here. My men will take care of them.
We leave the capital tonight.
-What about military roadblocks? -There's only one.
How do we avoid it?
We don't. We'd waste too much time.
We'll pass ourselves off as an aid convoy.
How do we do that?
We have passes at the NGO office. We'll go pick them up.
Think of the villagers. We're here for them.
What about them?
There are other gas pockets.
One goes down to the village.
So?
The wall between the pockets could collapse, wiping out the village.
When were you going to tell me?
-My brother's wife and kid are there. -I know.
If anything happens to us, they'll be evacuated.
What about the other villagers?
We can't take everyone. It's 5,000 people.
The bandits wouldn't let us get far.
The experts gave us 24 hours before it happens.
We'll make it.
Hey! We're stuck with each other for 500 miles.
We need to trust each other if we want to make it.
Masks on. It's gas.
Fuck!
Clear! We're out of range.
There are clean clothes in the locker room.
Stop!
-Stop! -Let me go.
Stop, Alex! Calm down!
Alex, calm down!
Stop it. Wait!
-Calm down! -Let me go!
Alex.
I know why you're angry. I get it.
But people will die if you can't look past it.
Hey.
At least think of your family.
How are they?
-How are they? -They're fine.
-How are they? -They're fine. They're waiting for you.
Is that nitro?
From the solar plant.
When they install new solar panels,
they use it to blow up the rocks
and level the ground.
That kind of explosive hasn't been used for 30 years.
A stockpile has been sitting idle since the coup.
We'll go and get it.
A team is there. We just need to load the truck.
You need to understand what we are transporting.
How much do you need for the well?
One hundred kilos.
And we'll find that at the plant?
Twice that. And we'll take it all.
Why carry 200 if we only need 100?
That's the job I'm being paid for.
-One truck won't be enough. -Why not?
To stabilize 200 kilos of nitro, we need two trucks.
We only have one driver.
I'll be the second.
Okay. We'll head to the NGO. Get the trucks ready.
Do as I say and shut your mouth.
Grab some crates. We need eight per truck.
Okay, wait here.
-Shouldn't you be at the village? -I came back for you.
I came back for you too.
Didn't feel so good, did it?
-Here. Grab this. -Thank you.
PASS
And the two brothers?
Real ball-busters. But we need them.
Alex. We need to talk.
What don't you understand?
If a well wasn't on fire, I'd still be in prison.
Right?
Is it working?
It will.
-How is it going? -Ten minutes out.
-How is it going? -Ten minutes out. The plant will be secure for your arrival.
Perfect. Meet you there.
Got one for me?
Thank you.
Your daughter's name is Malya, right?
I see her at the village.
She once told me she wanted to be a doctor.
That's her dream.
Hey.
You'll be reunited.
That's all I want.
Come on! Let's go!
We have less than 20 hours to get this done.
I didn't find anything.
Well, keep searching.
Put the logo on your vests.
Just stay calm.
I've never been calmer.
Your papers, please.
Check this out.
HQ. This is Unit 4.
We need a confirmation on ID A153025.
We're supposed to be informed 24 hours in advance to let you through.
Wasn't it done?
-No. -Sorry.
We really must get through. We have medicine for urgent delivery.
Okay, it's clear.
Fine. But next time, if it happens again, you won't get through.
There won't be a next time.
Let them through!
You did great.
Let's go! Keep moving!
Show them to the storage. Follow the bike.
Hang on, I don't get it.
It's your job, guys.
We'd be quicker together.
If I wanted to handle explosives, I'd have kept your share.
What are you doing?
I'll help them. We're in a hurry, right?
No, you know the route. We can't lose you.
I'm just being pragmatic.
Go on, Fred. Let's not waste time.
That's it. You're good.
We'll take this track on our way out.
Then get back on this road to save time.
What's the status?
Almost done. We're leaving soon.
All done!
What's your problem? Are you going to sulk for long?
Men died, but it's fine.
So? You think I don't care, is that it?
Is there a problem?
We have 200 kilos of nitro back there.
Lose the smug attitude and focus on the road. Understood?
Go straight. You can't go wrong.
No, it's fine.
What a dick!
Why didn't you ever mention your brother?
I don't know what happened. I don't wanna know.
But you look after his family and you can't tell me you're a coward.
Military roadblock!
Military roadblock.
There's never any military here.
Fuck.
They definitely aren't soldiers.
Hello.
Where are you going?
We've got medicine for a refugee camp.
That's a lot of people.
It's a dangerous road.
Get out. Let's see your papers.
To get through, you must pay.
We don't have money, just medicine.
-Can we see the medicine? -No.
Impossible.
He said it's impossible.
-I'm going. -What?
Don't worry.
Know what this means? We're here to help people!
We're with an NGO!
If we can't pass, people will die!
Okay.
Don't move. I said, don't move.
Show me your hands. I said, show me your hands!
-We're not dangerous. -Who are you?
-We're help-- -Where do you think you are?
Drop your gun or we both die.
Okay, let's calm down. Let's all stay calm.
Ordering us around like dogs!
You. Let him go.
Get away from him.
It won't--
Djibril!
Djibril!
No! Djibril!
-No! -Come on!
No!
-Let me go! -Let's move! Get in your trucks!
Go! Go!
Let me go!
Let's go! Let's catch them.
Let's go!
Shit.
Kill them all!
Turn right!
We went too fast. The straps need tightening.
Okay.
The pickup is out.
-Why'd you shoot? -Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
-Let me go! -Calm down!
Asshole! You should have died!
-Let go of me! -Stay calm.
Djibril's death is on you!
He knew the risks.
Leave me alone, please.
New route.
With the time left, we'll take the northern road.
Clara, did he consult you?
No, I didn't. Did she know about those bandits?
I'm still in charge, so what I say goes.
We're taking the northern road. It'll save us some time.
We have eight hours.
Echo, take the lead.
Come on, let's go. Move out.
How did you meet Djibril?
After the coup. He'd lost his parents.
The NGO took him in.
We must save the village. He can't have died for nothing.
It's risky around here, but we're saving time.
Stay alert.
Get down.
Cut your engine!
Don't move!
We're not being attacked.
It's a minefield.
It must go down to the river.
What do you suggest? We've lost too much time.
Can you defuse a mine?
No, but I'm not leaving you.
You'd better go back to your truck.
Get back as far as you can!
Come on.
Come on.
Don't move.
Don't move. Easy.
Sorry for what I did.
Can we talk later?
What?
It's an anti-tank mine. I can't defuse it.
Fuck!
Give me your hands.
I can't let you die here.
If you do that, we both die. Leave me.
You're my brother.
Now listen, and do as I say.
Give me your hands.
-No. -Do it!
Ready?
-Yeah. -Let's do it!
No, wait!
Do we do a countdown?
On three?
-On three. -Three!
Their equipment is so shitty.
Get behind me!
Rock, two o'clock!
Single sniper!
We'll kill you, assholes!
One by one.
Do you know how to fix this?
A hose must've popped off. I'll handle it.
I'm sorry.
He knew the risks. As we all do.
So, it doesn't affect you?
Who cares what it does to me?
-What counts is-- -Getting the job done.
If you think acting like an asshole is helping, you're wrong.
There are two routes. Either we go north
or we bypass it going west. Okay?
Okay.
We have two options.
Which one is the safest?
Neither of them. They merge 30 miles from the village.
Let's split up.
You and I will go first.
You two can leave when the truck is fixed. Head north.
He's right.
We only need one truck.
Splitting up doubles our chances of making it.
We'll make it.
All four of us.
Stay in touch and meet at the well.
Why are you taking him and not me?
I can't drive with you next to me.
I knew you were a sensitive guy.
Be careful, all right?
Fuck!
It's fine. Okay, we're good to go.
What are you doing?
If I get there alone, I get your share.
And theirs too.
You'll never make it.
It's only 30 miles.
I'll manage.
If they made it, so should we.
Drive. I'll guide you.
Okay.
Keep coming.
Keep going.
Hit the gas.
Well done. The truck needs to settle.
Are they already up there?
We're all gonna die.
Help!
Help! A man is hurt.
-Someone's hurt. -A man is hurt.
He says someone's hurt.
Fred!
What happened?
-What happened? -Nothing.
We found him like that.
He was shot by a man in a truck like yours.
It was Gauthier.
Hey, I…
I'll get the truck.
Hey! You gotta grit your teeth.
Okay? You grit your teeth.
Fred, look at me.
Fred, stay with me.
Look at me, please.
That's it. Keep your eyes open. Breathe slowly.
I'm still waiting for the drilling team.
I've had no news.
The chopper got shot down. I can't send another team.
It's bad for the company.
Find a solution.
What solution? I'm alone in the fucking desert!
You are responsible for the site. If the well explodes,
you're history. Understood?
Find a local solution.
What do you mean by that?
You heard.
When you get the nitro,
make sure it ends up in the well.
Bring the chopper. And get the wife and daughter.
Fuck!
What are you doing?
Hold on. We're almost there.
-Alex! -Stay here.
Come here.
Don't try anything.
What are you doing?
Where is Gauthier?
He's dead, but we have the nitro.
Call the team to put it out.
There is no team!
No one is coming.
We're the only ones left.
And the only way to save the villagers
is to drive into it with the nitro.
A chopper is on its way.
Save your family.
Drive into the well.
I swear I'll take your wife and child with me.
Dad.
Dad!
Fred.
Fred, open the door.
-We took an Uber. -Uber, honey.
And he was really kind.
Yeah, he thought we were funny, because we are.
-How you feeling? -I feel good.
I'm excited to see my second showing of this to see how it's different.
I know. Sorry I couldn't make the other one.
You're in school, that's okay. So you're free?
Yeah, I'm free.
Yeah, the ponytail feels like a last show kind of moment.
-You've been ponytailing, okay? -You have, I know.
-Your braid on Kimmel this morning? -Did you see that?
-It was so cute. -Yeah?
-Yeah. -Thanks! I'm glad you guys approve.
-[Sasha] We do. -[Malia] We approve.
-I miss you guys. -[Malia] I know. We missed you!
But we have a full two weeks of actual time together.
[Michelle] See, I'm not gonna ask for more.
-I was gonna say-- -We were saying that.
Only because you called us both separately.
And we were like, "Why is she calling? Like, we don't have too many dinners
to run out of things to say."
[Oprah] Three-and-a-half hours in the car.
Wow!
I could've flown from here to Chicago.
It's true. You could go back to Chicago sometime soon.
Could have gone back to Chicago, unbelievable.
-So we will-- -Hi, there.
-Hello, welcome. -This is Rita.
-She will be our stage manager... -Hey, Rita.
-...getting us everywhere. -Stage manager. Hey.
-It's the last show, you guys. -[costume dresser] I know.
-[stylist] She's good. Want these on here? -[Michelle] All right.
Well done.
Are you ready to see Michelle Obama? Make some noise!
-[applause] -Come on! Here we go!
Last night!
-Last night. We're gon' make it right. -In LA.
-It's gon' be real bright. -On the last night.
Two, three!
I am becoming!
[Michelle] Four years ago when I released my memoir Becoming,
I traveled across the country and around the world,
meeting so many incredible people, including some of you.
The tour was one of the best experiences of my life.
But then, almost in an instant, everything changed.
The world locked down and closed in.
We were torn apart from one another.
At the same time, we were dealing with other deeply personal challenges.
A long past due reckoning with race in America.
All of this has left us shaken and angry,
despondent and unseen,
and perhaps more than anything else, alone.
How did we get here?
How have we changed?
And most importantly, how can we regain some stability?
These are the questions I've been pondering
in my new book and podcast.
And I'm sure a lot of you have too.
And that's why we're here tonight, together again.
Because even when the world feels so dark,
we're all trying to protect, kindle, and share the light we carry.
Believe me, I don't have all the answers.
Far from it. But I do have my story.
And you do too.
And to help us begin to weave those stories together,
I'm thrilled to have my dear friend here to illuminate a path forward.
Please give a warm welcome to the one and only
-Oprah Winfrey! -[crowd cheers]
Hello, LA!
Hello!
Hello, LA!
Hello, LA up there!
Hello, LA out there!
So good to see you, LA!
Wow!
Oh, my goodness.
So, how fantastic that you're out here
on a Tuesday night?
For the last night of The Light We Carry tour!
Look at you!
Okay. So I know all of you have been, at some point in your life,
to an event where the host
is standing there before you and says,
"We have our guest this evening who needs no introduction,"
and then they spend the next 20 minutes...
telling you everything that person did since they was born.
I'm not gon' do that.
I'm not gon' do that.
'Cause I know you already know who's here.
I know 'cause you went through the 101 and the 405 and the 5...
and the 10...
I came down on the 101, took three-and-a-half hours.
I'm here for the same reason you are.
To get some of that light she's carrying!
So the woman who needs no introduction, for real.
Our forever First Lady,
Michelle Obama!
Michelle Obama!
Oprah Winfrey!
-Look at this. -Look at LA!
[Oprah] YouTube Theater!
Final night!
Oh, my goodness!
LA!
[Michelle] Now, this is a way to end a tour.
-This is-- -I think this is it.
I have to say, it's a Tuesday night...
-It's Tuesday night! -It's not even...
It's not even the middle of the week and the people came
-to see you. -Oh, my goodness.
Well...
I think it was a pretty big added bonus
that we got Miss Oprah Winfrey here, too.
I have to just say this, every other moderator
was so glad that they weren't following you.
-So... -Well...
It's so interesting, because...
I've been watching you on Instagram
and people have been sending me, "Oh, my gosh,
you should see what Conan did, what Tracee Ellis Ross did,
what Gayle did." "Did you see Tyler? Did you see Ellen?"
And so I was feeling kind of like, "Oh, my God..."
Was your fearful mind kicking in?
-My fearful mind! -See? Even Oprah Winfrey has
-a fearful mind. -A fearful mind!
-You know? -Actually--
You know what happened? I thought,
"Okay, I'm going to go back to the toolbox..."
Exactly. You know how to do this.
-"I know how to do an interview." -I know how to do an interview! [laughs]
-I'm not scurred of the people. -[Michelle] Right! [laughs]
-So here we are. -Yes. Thank you for being here,
-my dear, dear friend. -Thank you. I love you so much.
-I love you too. -I appreciate you so much.
-Same. Back at you. -What you stand for.
So this is a final night, you all, of a six-city tour
that evolved from a lockdown.
-Oh, yeah. -So, you came out on the other side
and brought us The Light We Carry. Championing of The Light We Carry.
But before you got to the other side,
I want to know where were you and what was going on
when you first realized this here is serious,
-and we not going nowhere? -Yeah, yeah.
You know, interestingly enough, I was on the road.
The tour had just finished, we took some time off, and I was on the road
doing a couple of speaking engagements.
And I was in Las Vegas because I also coupled those engagements
with a celebration with my team
to thank them for the hard work they had done on the tour.
-So this is March 2020. -This is March.
And there was still buzz about COVID in the air, but,
you know, it's sort of back and forth, "What is this?" So we're in Las Vegas,
and that's when there was a slow wave of cancellations.
You remember that ripple effect? Because people didn't know what to do.
-Correct. -Companies were making
split decisions and so we're stuck in Vegas
watching the world slowly turn off. That's what it felt like.
You know? Events started being canceled. And we're in Vegas.
Slowly, the casinos started to empty out.
The streets in Las Vegas started to empty.
It felt like we were in a ghost town.
-Did you think you needed to get home? -Oh, yeah, yeah.
We were trying to be responsible and wait until the last event canceled.
-Right. -And then finally, they canceled it,
we got back on the plane, got home.
So that felt eerie, being out there on the road
when slowly, the world was shutting off.
-Well, we really weren't sure. -We weren't sure about anything.
-Everybody was just using hand sanitizer. -That's right.
-Washing off their groceries. -Yeah.
-Washing off the groceries, yes. -With soap. Yeah.
It was that phase, yes.
And then, I was worried about the girls because they were in--
still at school, and I'm thinking, "My babies are out there with the COVID!"
And I was hoping that the universities were gonna be responsible.
And then finally, the decision was made that they were coming home,
but then I was thinking, "Oh, my God, they're coming to my house?"
I was thinking, "They're going through airports and sitting on airplanes,"
so Barack and I cautioned them to wear masks.
And, when they got home,
I made them stay in the garage
and open all their stuff up.
I was going to make them stay out there.
I told them to take off their travel clothes.
We didn't know what was going on.
My husband thought I was being a little irrational,
but I was like, "We're trying to--" I-- We didn't know!
That's not irrational, honey. Stedman was in the guesthouse for 14 days.
I remember that!
That was during the 14-day period.
See now, Malia and Sasha, at least I let you come in the house.
But we were preparing to create a COVID-safe community,
and since they had traveled, we were kind of holding our breath
making sure they didn't bring any virus home.
So we didn't know how long to wait, what was the incubation period.
Were you actually afraid of getting COVID that first year before the vaccines
-were available? -It's interesting.
I think it helped that we lived with a former president...
-That might be helpful. -...who...
Not just any president, but a president who reads and believes in science.
Who had...
steered the country through several pandemics.
Remember Ebola?
I think one case reported in the U.S.
That was my husband.
Brought us back from the brink of depression,
everybody forgets that, how-- what bad shape we were in.
So we were living with what we call the fact guy.
He knew enough to know what this was.
So it was scary, but we had information.
-What was scary-- -So you were comfortably afraid.
We were comfortably afraid. What was scary--
As you talk about in the book, being comfortably afraid.
-I was downright scurred. -Yeah, but what scared me, Oprah,
was watching the confusion...
-Yes. -...in the world.
The mixed messages, the inconsistency,
the lack of leadership, the lack of a plan,
you know, watching people not take this seriously.
People treating the pandemic like it was an extended vacation.
People arguing about wearing masks,
watching kids partying on the beach in Florida.
-Remember? Yes. -That was scary
because I'm thinking all those kids are gonna go home
to a grandparent or somebody with an autoimmune disease,
and it is going to be catastrophic.
That was the thing that scared me. Watching disinformation.
That's scary.
Watching people attack scientists and the experts.
That was the frightening part of it for me.
Watching the world not deal with this well.
Listen, I ate my way through the pandemic.
-And we would have Taco Tuesday-- -We had Taco Tuesday!
-We loved Taco Tuesday. -We loved Taco Tuesday,
-but Tuesday kept coming around so fast. -Right, you know?
-"It's Tuesday again?" -Does that happen at your house
-where, "It's Tuesday again?" -Again?
Oh, my gosh. I was like what we now need to do Taco Tuesday every other Tuesday,
because it's happening so fast, and days would pass where I would be like,
"Did I do anything? Did I accomplish anything?"
And then you come out on the other side, you have written a book.
You have written a book.
So you weren't that way at first, right?
You didn't just say, "I am now going to take all of the personal problems
You didn't just say, "I am now going to take all of the personal problems that I have had, Barack,
and I'm going to take that energy
and I'm going to allow it to be a beacon for the lights
that we all carry."
-It didn't happen like that. -It didn't happen like that. Yes.
Well, the book came out of, like you-- people ask
for advice all the time. You know?
They're always asking me how have I done this?
"How'd you get here?" "How do you overcome your fear?"
"How do you find your voice?" "How do you feel seen when,
you know, you've been raised to not see yourself in the world?"
And so, I'd already been grappling with these questions, thinking,
"Well, when I get an opportunity to talk to kids,"
which I do occasionally, I still spend a lot of time talking to kids,
I try to answer those questions,
but I can only connect with so many kids, I'm thinking,
"They're looking for guidance, they're looking for a voice."
So, I started shaping the book even before the pandemic,
but I also found that I was spiraling down in a depression,
you know, with the loop in my head,
my fearful mind watching the world unravel,
and I needed to find my own hope.
I felt like I was losing a little bit of my own light.
And I had to kind of search my own toolbox
for ways to come out of that so that I could answer those questions
and continue to be of service, because when you get to those low emotional places,
because when you get to those low emotional places,
it's hard to find your light.
It's hard to think that sharing it will even matter.
Were you looking at the world the way we were all looking at the world?
From that fearful space? Because so much was happening
-and we had seen so many lies... -Yeah.
-...that had been denied... -Yeah.
...by people who we thought should have been reasonable,
that I think a lot of us started to think,
"Well, it doesn't matter. You know, Charlottesville,
very fine people on both sides." That nothing is going to change.
-Then we saw fear being weaponized. -Yeah.
And when you saw fear being weaponized
-by former president, not your husband... -Yes.
...did that make you fearful or did that make you angry?
Both.
It made me afraid. It made me angry. It was disappointing.
It was disappointing that, you know, after we tried so hard
to set such a high bar, where we tried so hard to get everything right,
to lead with hope, to promote kindness and compassion and empathy,
that...
-[applause] -the world chose either affirmatively--
they chose it or they were complacent and didn't vote.
Which hurt probably even more, because the people who didn't vote,
a lot of those people were the people who voted for us.
So, in a way, I felt a little abandoned, you know?
It's like, "Did it really matter, what we did? Does it?"
You know? And that's the dark part of those times.
But-- no, I-- and--
That was at that time, you know?
And we-- And I share it because we all go through those moments, you know?
It's like, we all can't be the beacons of hope all the time.
And I'm more of a cynic than my husband
who just has a light that is always hopeful.
And I am so lucky to live in the house with him
because he keeps me focused on the truth.
But yes, the weaponization of fear is a dangerous, dangerous thing.
You know, you look over any atrocity that has happened
in the course of human history,
slavery, The Holocaust, any war,
any misogyny, any hate crime, or homophobia,
it's all based in fear, greed, and a quest for power.
And so, it is a dangerous thing.
It is a dangerous thing to watch
how life is influenced by that fear.
It determines who gets an education,
who gets justice, you know?
Oftentimes, it's the difference between a slap on the hand
and a knee on the neck.
So it's got to be something that we are mindful of
and that we learn how to decode it for ourselves
so that leaders cannot use our fear against us to turn on one another.
It's a dangerous proposition.
And it's also, as you know, Oprah, as someone who has a huge platform,
has had it for a long time,
you know how easy it would be if you chose
to use your platform in a negative light.
But why don't you?
Why? After all those years, you had a TV show,
you could have gotten people whipped up about a whole lot of stuff,
but you chose not to. Why was that, pray tell?
Yes, and when you see other people using it
for such a disadvantage,
it's depressing, I think a lot of people were depressed and also numbed by it.
And you say that by the time you ordered those knitting needles online,
-that you had reached a really low place. -Yeah, yeah.
And so, I mean, I don't know how knitting's gon' bring you out of that,
-but okay. -I know, I know.
Well, knitting is a metaphor.
But I did learn how to knit.
Didn't I knit you something?
-Oh, I knit-- That was Gayle. -No, you did-- That was Gayle.
Gayle's grandson.
-You knitted a lovely, beautiful... -Yeah, well... You know, I--
I made that sweater!
-I made that sweater! -Sweater.
-You made that sweater! -There's that cute little baby.
Yes. Luca.
What I got from knitting,
it was more meditative,
it served to quiet my mind
in a way that I needed, you know, in that way.
That's kind of what faith does for you.
You know? It shuts your brain off.
See, we try to think our way out of so much.
And our mind, we don't have much control over it.
That's why you give it up, you know?
You got to give it up to something bigger than you.
But what I learned through that, what I was able to unravel,
was like, when we're in these times where the problem seems so big
and insurmountable,
we really have to focus on what we can control.
You know? That's really all we can do, is tend to the knitting in our lap.
And guess what? That's enough.
I mean, we live in a world where bigger always is better,
where we're always being busy.
We're trying to tackle everything in a big way.
Our kids are subjected to that.
When I get letters from young people, they're trying to, at 15,
"I gotta save the world. I'm gonna fix my neighborhood."
And my whole thing is you don't have the power or the leverage to do that yet.
You need to focus on your knitting,
and if you're 12 or 15, your knitting is your homework,
it's finishing school.
And the reason-- the lesson that came out of that for me is that,
start with the thing that is small that you can control.
-That's right. -Control what you can.
That's right.
You know, the one theme
that lifts from the pages of The Light We Carry for me
is that you were raised well.
-I was lucky. -You were raised well.
-I was blessed. -My goodness, did you have incredible,
-stellar, powerful parents. -Yeah. Yes.
Yes. Who cared about you and had an open mind.
And I think what's really wonderful is that
you give-- devote a whole section, chapter to "Meet my mom,"
and, and some of her great gems for raising children,
one of my favorite, which is, "Parent the child you've got."
-Yes, indeed. -That's great.
But what I was left with, this feeling that,
wow, I wish we all could have met your father.
Yeah.
I wish we all could have met him
because I think the message that he gave you as a young girl,
"Nobody can make you feel bad about yourself
-if you feel good about yourself..." -That's right.
-...is the underlying theme of this book. -Yeah.
-Yeah. -Yes.
At the very end of the day,
we cannot control what other people think, say, or do.
We just can't do it.
Our light can't be dependent on somebody else, right?
Because they may not have it to give.
My father was just a living life lesson for me, you know,
because he was a Black man, working class,
probably poor, although we didn't feel like we were poor,
you know, who had MS
and struggled throughout his life with the disability.
And we watched his body deteriorate,
and I opened with the story of his cane because that was an important tool.
You know? Instead of giving up on life,
he could have, you know, chucked it all and started collecting disability
and never worked a day in his life.
But instead he chose to use whatever tool he needed.
First, it was a cane, and when that stopped working,
he switched those out for two crutches.
And then when that stopped working later on in life,
he needed more assistance.
He replaced that with a walker.
Eventually, he needed a motorized cart.
All throughout our life. But he never stopped.
He never blamed anyone,
he never let his-- the disappointment that must-- he must have felt,
it never burned him up.
It didn't turn him negative, you know?
He would have falls,
I don't know whether he fell when he was on his way to work,
but he would fall at home, catch his foot on the rug.
And to see your father fall to the ground,
it exposed all of our vulnerabilities.
It was frightening,
but my dad did his best to get up quick and laugh it off
because laughter was a tool as well.
But what I learned from him, as I say in the book,
"You fall, you get up, you keep moving."
So if he could find a light in all that he was going through,
and he could be a light for others,
because he was like the father of many who didn't have them,
in my family, in my community.
He saw his own light, and he taught me that that's my job,
to see my own light, you know?
Yeah. That's why I love that as the reigning theme of the book,
"Nobody can make you feel bad about yourself if you feel good."
And what you're saying in The Light We Carry
is that it's your job to do the work to make yourself feel good.
-That's your responsibility. -That's right.
-[applause] -That always made me feel better.
It was like my father was showing me that I had control over my life.
-Yes. -I had control over my feelings.
I didn't have to count on somebody being nice to me,
somebody being fair to me.
We knew life was unfair.
So when I think of my father, I, you know, anytime I feel self-pity,
I feel sorry for myself, you know, I feel like it's somebody else's fault,
I think about my father, and that keeps me focused, and straight,
and clear-headed, and grateful,
in ways that I just, it-- it's a gift.
Can you finish this sentence? "I still hear my father's voice when..."
Whenever.
I mean, it's as deep as like, whenever.
His voice is ringing through my head.
His voice was, you know, with me on my first day at Princeton, you know,
settling myself into this bastion of elitism.
You know? He was with me on my first day at my law firm.
And even after he died,
he still was there walking me down the aisle
because he helped model for me the man I should have.
So I was able to see Barack.
I was able to see him, see past all the external stuff,
and the external stuff was really pretty good ladies, but...
but I could see what was important to look for in a man.
You know? He's with me now, he is with me on this stage.
He is what I tap into when I'm trying to speak some truth to people
and show my authenticity and my vulnerability.
He is there whenever.
I love that you said that he helped you in many ways
to be able to see what you needed to see in Barack Obama.
Can we talk about your husband for a minute?
-Oh, yes, please. Yes, please. -Okay.
People have tried to capture your love story.
-Oh, there he goes. -They've tried to capture the love story.
They made a movie, the drama movie, they did the series on the First Lady.
They did-- trying, but they can't get it!
-Nah. -They cannot get it.
But you summed it up so completely in just one sentence
that was so powerful that when I read it,
it actually stopped me and made my eyes water.
You remember what the sentence was in the book?
-No, what was it? -[crowd laughs]
-No, what was it? -[crowd laughs] Well, I don't know what sentence made you weep.
Okay, the sentence--
You were talking about you've lived many places.
-And... "And Barack is my home!" -Oh, and Barack is my home.
-Yes. -"Barack is my home."
-Barack is my home. -"Barack is my home."
Yes, he is.
Now, go home and see if you can ask yourself that question.
About the person you with.
You so silly.
Are they your home?
And I appreciate how you break it down to us
that first trip to Hawaii.
Because when you first arrived in Hawaii, you were looking for--
and I understand why, you a working woman
and had never been to Hawaii,
so you looking for the Hawaii in Hawaii Five-O.
Those of you who remember that show.
-Mai tais and sunsets on the beach. -Mai tais and honeymoon...
and honeymoon suites.
But instead...
Yeah, instead, it was a trip home to visit his family.
That's where he was from.
He wasn't going back to some island vacation,
he was going back to be with his people.
But I was young and I was-- it was cold in Chicago
and I thought, "I'm going to Hawaii with my man."
"It's gonna be so romantic."
And then we landed and we went straight to Toot and Gramps' apartment.
No ocean.
It was a high-rise building, go up to the tenth floor,
you know, walk in. Looks like my grandparents' house.
Might as well be on south side of Chicago, which was a wonderful thing.
-Right? -Yes.
To know that I was familiar with his family, right?
Then we cuddle up. What's on the TV?
60 Minutes.
And, you know, they-- they pull out some TV trays
and I think we probably had tuna sandwiches with sweet pickles.
I was like, "Yes, I do like this."
But then some days, you would go to the beach.
And then I love the moment where he says,
-"Okay, gotta go." -"We're going back to Toot and Gramps'."
-"We're going back to the house." -Like, "Aw," you know.
So I was young and silly and I started feeling like,
"I don't know if I like this. It's not as romantic as I thought."
Although, I didn't act like that.
So my mother knows I did not act like some little spoiled person.
-I was very-- -But you are thinking,
-"Where is the Hawaii from Hawaii-Five-O?" -Yeah. Where is--
Right. Exactly.
But I conclude the story by saying that, you know,
what Barack was showing me was the real of him.
And sometimes as people looking for partners,
we're looking for what we think are mai tais and sunsets,
and what we need is somebody who respects and loves their family
-and is going to show up for them... -And showing you that.
-...again and again. -That's what they're showing you.
And Barack valued the time that he had with his family.
It was nice to go to the beach,
but being there for his mother and his grandmother, his little sister,
helping them work through their stuff, he was the rock of their family.
And let me just tell you, he always shows up
for me and the girls in that same way.
He is present and there when we need him.
And that's what he was showing me in Hawaii
when I was trying to get to the beach.
-[crowd laughs] -[Oprah] I think what we also appreciate
in both Becoming and also in The Light We Carry
is how you are so candid about your relationship,
about your life, and how everything is not perfect.
You say it took some time and a lot of practice
for you all to work through your disagreements.
-So, what's your style and his style? -Yeah.
You know, I've said this to him, I've said this before,
one of the things that's different in how we show love is that
because his family lived far away and traveled a lot,
he had to learn to love at a distance, you know?
And that means there are more words said, more love exchanged,
more physical, you know...
-The "I love you" and all that. -Yeah, "I love you. I love you."
-"Love you too. Love you too." You know? -Yeah.
I grew up where everybody, like,
within eight blocks of each other, you know,
all my aunts and uncles, and great uncles and cousins
and, you know, everybody celebrated birthdays.
So we were with each other every weekend,
twice a week, and, "Happy birthday to you." That's what we did.
We were always together, so it was like, "Bye.
I don't have to tell you I love you 'cause I'm gonna see you Saturday, right?"
So love for me was showing up, you know, it was like,
"Yeah, yeah, stop kissing me, just do the laundry."
And we also are temperamentally different. You know?
Guess what I am? Kind of hot-headed, you know?
Talkative, easy to get mad.
It's like, "What?" Barack wants to talk rationally.
And I'm like, "Rational? Ration-- Don't come to me with sense.
-I'm angry. -[crowd laughs]
Don't come to me with your three bullet points.
You better get out of here and let me cool down."
I don't wanna hear none of that reason.
Okay. So how long-- What's the cooling off period for you?
It's definitely, like, what he thought was like,
"Okay, that was five minutes. Are you ready to talk?"
It's like, "That's not enough!"
It's time.
It's time. It could be hours.
Sometimes it could be days where I just don't--
I just don't want to talk to you right now.
But we had to learn--
But here's the thing, we had to learn how to compromise.
I have to learn that I can't pop off on him, you know?
And also, he's got to give me space to calm down.
That-- That is a lesson.
We're still-- We're still practicing that, but I share it
because I see so many young couples
who don't know what real marriage is.
You know? They spend more time, you know,
picking out the third dress for the wedding and reception
and the wish board of the flowers they want,
and, you know, planning the third bachelorette thing.
I mean, y'all spend way too much money on weddings.
-[crowd cheers] -Way too much.
-And-- -Yeah, what you want is big anniversaries.
-You want big, huge anniversaries, right? -You want big anniversaries.
But we have to be honest with people,
I believe, more of us have to be honest about the work
that it takes to build a life with another person.
It-- To me, it doesn't seem, like, it's that controversial, you know?
-I mean-- -What's controversial
is somebody of your stature being this honest about it.
That's exactly right.
You know? It's like all, "hashtag relationship goals,"
and I'm like, "I was mad at him in that picture."
Not only that...
So you told Gayle during the tour in Philadelphia,
which was just a couple of weeks ago, that in 30 years of marriage,
ten of them, you couldn't stand your husband.
-Exactly. -And then...
You know, and people are like, "Oh, my God!"
Yes. Social media went crazy, like...
-I was like, "It's been 30 years." -Look at Michelle Obama keeping it real.
-Keeping it real. -Exactly.
That's because social media is anything but real, you know?
They wouldn't know real social media if it kicked them in the face.
Why do you think, though, that struck such a nerve?
-Like, when you said 30 years-- -Well, because young people can't imagine
being unhappy for a minute, let alone for ten years.
It's like, "I can't-- I deserve to be happy."
And it's like, "Who said that? Where'd you get that from?"
I was never raised that happy--, my personal happiness,
and my feelings in my household. It was like, "You better sit down."
"I don't care what you talking about."
But, you know, the point being is that you are gonna hit on some hard times.
Because if you're married for 30 years, and you have ten bad ones,
I would take those odds, you know?
But I also said they happen to coincide with the birth of the children.
Those two, they ruined all the love.
They just sucked it out of the house.
They came in with their cuteness and their needing to eat all the time
and their inability to communicate and you can't be mad at them.
I mean, they're cute. They're your babies.
So who else is in the household that I can, "Oh, it's you!"
"It's your fault, Barack Obama."
So, and then they, you know, they grow up and they leave the nest
and it's like, "Oh, there you are."
"That's my boo. I remember you."
That's about ten years, you know?
-So, look-- -So, what for you is romantic now?
-What do you consider romantic? -Romantic is...
I love when my husband plans something, right?
Because it is-- it is hard to plan
when you are the president or the former president, right?
So if he can surprise me with a--
And he gets so pleased with himself when he pulls something off, right?
And our 30th anniversary was probably the latest romantic thing that he did
because he recreated our honeymoon,
which was driving along the Pacific Coast when we were first married.
We started in San Francisco, rented a car, drove all the way down through Big Sur,
stopped and saw the Redwoods and went through Santa Barbara,
and then ended in LA, and it was just the two of us.
And he created that.
Now, it wasn't just the two of us because we were in a motorcade,
and we had our agents and three cars behind.
In that shot, there are like 12 people in the back, you know, trying to hide.
It's changed, but everyone was so excited.
All of his agents were like, "You-- You-- We're going on a walk next."
And it's like-- And they were trying to-- they were trying to lay back,
and all our aids. We travel with a crowd, you know?
-But he planned it. -It was romantic.
It was very romantic. It was very, very sweet.
-And he didn't golf, not once. -Okay. At all?
Okay. So in Becoming, you told us so much about, you know,
the years when he was away, and those years,
I think, when you were feeling badly in the relationship, in the marriage.
Has it changed now that he's home?
Where the-- all the wives are like, "Mmm."
Has it changed?
-Yeah. -Is he a different kind of husband now
than he was in all those years with all the pressure?
Well, you know what?
No, I think he's been pretty consistent, you know?
I've grown, I've changed.
I've learned that, you know, over these years that I, you know,
I have to make me happy, you know?
It goes back to the-- the lessons from my father.
-[applause] -He's not responsible for my happiness.
He loves me, he cares about me,
but most of my unhappiness had to do with choices I was making,
like I had to be the perfect mother.
I had to do everything right.
I had to hold down a job and make sure that the--
I was holding myself to a standard that was stressful for me.
-And also impossible. -And absolutely impossible.
Because you can have it all, perhaps, but you can't have it all--
At the same time.
-Let us say that again. -You can-- You say it.
You can have it all, but not at the same time.
You really can't. You know, that whole--
No, it is impossible,
especially if you want to be a good parent,
you know, and spend any time with your kids.
It's a tough balancing act.
I really appreciated in The Light We Carry
when you talked about how you recognized and Barack recognized
that you couldn't be everything for each other,
and that's why your kitchen table of friends is so important,
and as you say, has helped to take the pressure off of your marriage.
-Yeah. Absolutely. -Tell us about that kitchen table.
You know-- All right.
I'm going to tell the story of when you met my kitchen table.
-Yeah. Tell it, sure. -Can I tell that story?
It's not in the book, but...
Oprah kindly hosted my 50th birthday party.
-Was it my 50th? -It was your 50th.
Not just your 50th-- Oh, see, I wasn't going to tell that story.
-I didn't know I could tell that story. -Okay.
So you said yes before you knew I was talking about it.
No, I know you gon'-- I want you to talk about what I was gonna--
I was gonna-- A moment ago,
say Barack Obama, President of the United States,
-called me... -Yeah, right. to ask me would I host--
And at the end of the conversation,
he says, "Make sure you note that I'm the one making this call."
"I'm the one that told you to arrange all this."
"So I'm the one that made the call. I didn't have an assistant call you."
So when you were telling that story, I just thought,
-"Oh, that's why he said that." -That's why he said that.
-"I'm the one that's making this call." -That's right.
-"I'm the one that's making this call." -That's right. So we're coming to stay with you, graciously hosting us,
you said, "Bring your friends," and I was like, "Okay."
And she's like, "How many people?" And I said, "Well, it's like 12."
-Twelve. -And you were like...
What'd you say? You were like, "You don't have 12 good friends."
-I did. -I was like, "I do, I do."
-"I'm not trying to stack the date!" -Who has 12 good friends?
I do.
And-- And Oprah's like, "I got Gayle."
-And what I said was like-- -The only person
I know with 12 good friends was Jesus and the disciples.
That's the only person I know.
-But then you met-- -And then one of them betrayed him.
Okay?
-But then you met my kitchen table. -Yes.
And you saw that I collect and keep my friends throughout life, you know.
So I've got my roommate from college,
I've got my best friend from law school,
I've got the moms who, you know, helped me in Chicago,
we were like a unit, we raised our kids together.
Some of those kids are here tonight.
-You know, they are like my children. -Yes.
I had a whole new set of mom friends and women
in Washington, D.C.
who could understand that life,
a couple of who were married to people in Barack's administration.
And when you're in that world,
you need someone who understands, like, that plight.
They were my ride or dies.
So I tend to collect people throughout life and keep them.
Because different people bring different things to my life.
But the bottom line is that I call it my kitchen table
because the kitchen table in our home was always the place
where we felt safe, you know?
We'd come in as little kids from the woes of the playground
and the, you know, give and take of the neighborhood
and complaining about a teacher or some unfairness
and you could always let it out at the kitchen table.
You felt safe and seen.
It was probably the first table where I felt seen by my mother and father
who loved to hear our stories and our voices.
But you always got rejuvenated at that table.
You know, you could let out the insults and the slights
and yell and scream and get that out your system
so that you could get yourself together
and go back out there like you had some sense, you know?
So my kitchen table is that for me.
There are so many different aspects to my life, you know?
I've had so many different facets, from motherhood to professionalism,
and on and on and on,
that that table has just gotten bigger and bigger.
This is a question, just occurred to me.
Did all of the friends-- So I met those 12, kitchen table--
But did all of your friends make the cut once you went to the White House?
Nope.
-No, they did not. -Because, you know what?
I remember having a conversation with you,
and we were talking about-- and you said, "Lost oxygen, couldn't make the climb."
-Yep. Nope. -"Lost oxygen, couldn't make the climb."
And I tell the story about friendship because, you know, we--
It feels like we--
The studies are showing that people have fewer friends than ever,
and we're reporting these ridiculous rates of loneliness.
Loneliness, yes.
I think social media has gotten us out of the habit.
I think our young people, because of the pandemic,
they think they've got friends on social media.
I remember Sasha's first account with that, you know, when she was little,
and we let her have a-- whatever it was called,
and then she comes up but the--
Because we had everybody follow her, agents, staff, you know.
It was like, you know, if you gon' have this,
everybody's watching. And then somebody came back and said,
"You know, Sasha's got a thousand friends,"
and I was like, "Little girl,
you don't know a thousand people," you know?
But that's how young people-- It's early.
You think you got a thousand friends and you're, you know, ten?
We've gotten out of that habit.
But we need people.
We need real contact.
We need connection to keep us grounded and stable.
So for the friends that didn't make the cut
-or couldn't-- who lost oxygen-- -Oh, yeah, we'll go back to...
-Yeah. -...who didn't make the cut.
I want to know for the friends who didn't make it,
did you actually have to tell them that, "Sorry," or did somebody else tell 'em?
There were different versions for different people, right?
Depending upon what the issue was.
But here's the thing that I learned.
Stay open to friends, be open to making new ones.
I want my girls to be this way
because I don't want them living in the world afraid of opening up
and making friends, you know?
'Cause you got sense, you can trust,
you know when people, how far they-- to take them,
but when they show you who they are, you gotta...
-Believe them. Believe them. -Gotta believe them, and then move on.
And some friends, you know, had foibles that were fine for regular friends.
But once you-- we get into the White House,
it's like, "Oh, you-- Oh, you can't be that person...
-Up in here. -...and be up in here, you know?"
It's like, "We-- We got too much at stake."
-Absolutely. -You know?
And they weren't gon' be my friends that messed up.
I mean, Barack might want to keep some friends that--
but that, it was his presidency.
But my-- if my friends weren't acting right?
It was like "slow ghost."
You know, the "slow ghost"?
Where you don't like, cut 'em off right away,
-but you just become less available? -[crowd cheers, laughs]
-Slow ghost. Okay. -Slow ghost.
I really appreciated how in Becoming you talked about,
and you use this word, the velocity of things coming at you
when you were in the White House.
And in The Light We Carry,
you talk about it being surreal.
-Yeah. -There's a point where you say,
"We needed a pencil box for Sasha and a ball gown for me,
and we needed a toothbrush holder, and an economic rescue package."
-Yes. -"That my days became a surreal mishmash
of the mundane and the extraordinary," is what you said.
I appreciated the moment where you talked about
watching Sasha for the first time with a playmate
and the-- how relieved you were seeing that that was working out.
And then the playmate's mom comes to pick her up,
secret service is like, "Don't get out of the car."
Yeah.
And that mom ended up being one of your kitchen table friends.
Absolutely.
I was more worried about the girls settling in
and having a normal life,
and nothing spells normalcy than having a playdate in your house,
even if it's the White House.
Having real friends and feeling like a regular parent, you know?
Going to the parent-teacher conference
and, you know, Barack coached the fourth grade Vipers,
a little girls basketball league.
He was the coach.
I know. I don't know if I've told that story before.
He's written about it in his book,
but he was the parent coach of her fourth-grade team.
-Were people freaking out? -That was kind of surreal,
probably more so for everybody else in the gym,
but he would start easing his way down, because it was a parent coach team,
and he being a basketball freak was very disturbed
by the fact that the little girls weren't tying their shoes
and they were running no plays.
And he felt like they were just squandering their skills...
-[Oprah and crowd chuckles] -...and it wasn't just Sasha on the team,
but it was also Maisy Biden, who's Joe's youngest granddaughter.
They're best of friends.
But Maisy was a superb athlete
and Barack felt like they could be champions.
So he slowly moved those coaches out of the way
and started running practices for the girls outside on weekends.
They learned two plays, I think one was "box"
and it was, like-- that's all they could manage, two plays.
But being in that gym on any given Sunday when they were playing in it--
all of us went because we were all kind of engaged.
So you imagine a little community gym on a Sunday
with the President, the First Lady, the Vice President, the Second Lady,
Grandma, Malia, all of the kids,
and all their agents descending upon this one gym,
and then you got the people on the other side, right?
You know, and it wasn't like Joe or Barack were holding back.
They were like, "Shoot the ball! Steal it! Steal it! Get her! Get her!"
-And I'd have to say, "Joe, Joe." Like... -[Oprah] It's fourth grade.
[Michelle] And you're the Vice President.
[Oprah] Okay.
You know? These little girls were like, "Is he yelling at me?"
But those times felt...
Those times felt like... that's when we felt like we were alive,
and we were doing not just the work of the country,
but we weren't neglecting the children that were ours. You know?
We had a responsibility as parents to make sure our kids weren't screwed up.
Even as we, you know, worked on health care
and helped girls get an education.
It's like, who would we be if we didn't...
-Great job. -...take care of our knitting,
which was our girls.
What is so surprising about The Light We Carry
is you open the door to your own vulnerabilities.
I mean, you just open them all up there,
which makes us feel ever and even more close to you,
because you have shown us that you are so real.
And so, I wonder if you still struggle with self-consciousness.
Oh, my God, yes.
That fearful mind is still in there, you know?
I'm still trying to manage her.
But yeah, I think that, you know, that's baked into my DNA as a Black woman.
You know, I am here now, but, you know,
I've had my slings and arrows, you know.
I don't know if you remember what it was like for us
when we first came to the White House,
when people were challenging my husband's birth certificate
and calling me an angry, bitter Black woman
and accusing us of not loving our country,
not "being American," "one of them."
That was part of the game of "otherising" us, as I say,
"Make them other, not like us,
and then you'll be afraid of them and scared of them."
You know, you don't let go of needing to constantly prove yourself
because people's bar is so low for you.
I know that there are a lot of people in this audience
who have experienced people who continually
-underestimate them, you know? -Right. Right.
Who talk down to you, who think less of you, who misjudge you
because of the-- your differentness, whatever it is.
And again, I define differentness broadly.
You carry that.
But I have worked over time to try to use that energy
and fuel my light and not let somebody else dim it.
I've tried to take the attitude of, "I'll show you."
"You don't think I can do this?"
"You don't think I'm gonna be a good First Lady?"
-"I'm going to work my butt off." -[crowd cheers]
So hard work, for me, is the way I try to combat that.
I'm going to work my way into visibility.
I don't think anybody who is not a person of color
can ever fully understand when you say in The Light We Carry
that for eight years as First Lady, you said,
"I've been vigilant and cautious and deeply aware that Barack and I,
and our daughters, had the eyes of the nation upon us,
and that Black people in an historically White House,
-we could not afford to screw up." -Yeah.
And you did not.
You did not!
Not once!
Not once!
Not once did you screw up!
Well, there was the tan suit.
But there was the tan suit.
Although, I was gonna say-- I know.
Do you know how extraordinary that is?
Not only did they not screw up,
nobody in the family screwed up.
There were no sidebar family members.
But let me just say what Marian Robinson always says,
which is-- it keeps us humble and focused.
We're representing the truth of who we have always been, you know?
There are a lot of us out there that people, again, who feel different,
who are proving their way into relevancy and are not making missteps.
And, you know, so that's why, as my father tried to say,
I have to constantly remind myself,
"I cannot prove my way out of somebody else's mirror
if they're choosing to see me in a different way."
"That cannot be my focus, their poison can't be mine."
And that is the message to everybody here, especially our young people
who are starting to feel the slings and arrows of otherness,
the limits that people are trying to set in their world.
We have to practice being kind to ourselves
and greeting ourselves with gladness
and fueling our own light and managing our own fears
because some people out there, they will never see us.
It will never be enough,
and I contend with that by using empathy
and reminding myself
if somebody is that locked into their smallness,
they are struggling with self-doubt, you know?
They're struggling with a level of not-enoughness,
and I've got to be able to see that
and find compassion for that,
and then keep living my life as real,
as vulnerably, as truthfully as I can,
and not let that bog me down.
Well, that's 'cause you always goin' high, that's why.
Oh, yeah. We'll talk about that in a minute.
-There you go again. -There you go, going high.
Okay. How does it feel now to be liberated
from the scrutiny and the judgment
in something as simple as
-what you choose to wear on your body? -Yeah.
Because, remember when Michelle and Barack and the family
went to the Grand Canyon, and Michelle wore the shorts?
You... They tried to turn that into the biggest scandal.
And I was thinking the other day when I saw you in Atlanta
in some leather pants...
I said, "Mitch McConnell would call a senate hearing."
That's right.
If he saw you in those black leather pants...
...there would be a special session to discuss...
"What is she trying to say with those pants?"
-..."What is she trying to say?" -"What devilment is she plotting?"
"A revolution."
Can we talk about your evolving fab, funky...
What is happening with all this fly--
-You know, I think-- -What is happening?
Oprah, I think we... but we can relate to like '50s, '60s.
Plus, when you have lived long enough
not to care what anybody else thinks, I mean...
you know, it's just evolution and it's just growing up
and just realizing, "Let me just live my life, you know,
let me embrace who I am,"
and, you know, that's the thing about tools and, you know,
what I try to caution young people who feel like,
"I don't think that way. I haven't figured that out."
The first thing I say in that book to young people reading it
is be patient with yourself.
You know, it takes a lifetime to find your voice.
It is a process. It is an evolution.
You will not be-- You will not be all that you will be
until you're our age
and you've lived a little bit and you've had some bumps and you can--
-I love this book for young people. -Yeah.
-I bought 24 copies. -Excellent.
Yes.
I paid myself. I didn't ask for naa free.
-I bought 24-- -You sure didn't.
I did not. I bought 24 copies.
You should double that number.
For the...
See? Oprah's like never satisfied.
I sent... I sent...
-I sent them all to my girls. -Yeah.
And what I did was I underlined different part,
like page 68, page 157...
-"This is for you!" -"This is for you!"
And then I wrote in the beginning, "Love, from Mama O and Michelle."
-Yes, I'm glad you did. -Yes.
-You know I love your girls, so yeah. -Yeah.
So I think that this is a valuable tool...
Available wherever fine books are sold.
I think it's a valuable tool for young people, especially,
-not to mention a great gift. -Yeah.
And I hope it's the beginning of a lot of conversations
because this book is me sharing my tools.
This is what's worked, didn't work for me, but we all have them,
and we need to be vulnerable with each other, you know?
I mean, you think of all the things that we don't talk about?
Yes. Yes, like the Big M?
-Like the Big M? -Yes.
-I wonder-- -Young women are like, "What's that?"
How is the Big M? How is menopause treating ya?
You know, it's going all right. It's going all right.
I mean, I think I'm doing okay.
I think you're looking good!
But it's a trip.
You know... you know, it happened to me around 52, 53,
and I thought I was dying.
I really did, because I did not-- Did you have hot flashes?
I was able to-- I started hormone therapy. Yeah.
Okay. So I didn't know nothing about that.
See? And that's what we didn't know
-because the studies-- -People don't talk about it.
And here's the thing. People don't research us as women.
Why don't we know all about this, you know?
And then they want to tell us what to do with our wombs
and you don't even-- stay--
This is what I tell the men in my life.
"You don't know me, you know, so you should not comment on me."
"You shouldn't have opinion about me, the way my hair looks,
what happens inside my body, just stay out of it."
-Stay out of it. -I love that. I love that.
So, you-- Yes, I use hormone therapy also,
but I didn't know about it in the beginning.
So I didn't have hot flashes, I only had--
When I asked my mother about it, she was like, "I don't remember."
My mother says the same thing.
-"I don't remember." -"I don't remember."
It's like, "Ma, you don't remember anything. What good are you?"
And so I was having these-- I never had a hot flash,
-but I had terrible heart palpitations. -Oh, yeah.
I went from doctor to doctor to doctor, and nobody ever said,
"Oh, you know what? This could probably be--"
That's because no one is taking the time to focus on this issue.
I think our generation is going to change that...
-That's right. Absolutely. -...because we don't want our girls
to go through that. So we are going to talk about it.
So Maya Angelou used to say to me, "Baby, the fifties are everything
-you've been meaning to be." -Oh, yes.
"The fifties are everything
-you've been meaning to be." -It is amazing!
Do you feel that?
This is the best time I feel most clearly me.
And that's what-- This is where I feel the wisest, right?
And I think, you know, again, it's like, "This is social media."
It's like everybody-- We like to listen to young people
'cause we think there's some value in youth.
Y'all don't know nothing.
You know, it's like, if I want to hear about mothering,
I want to hear it from somebody who's finished it, you know?
I want to see how you-- yours has turned out
before I decide whether I take your advice.
Like, so I talk to my mother about mothering,
I'm not talking to, you know,
somebody on the 'Gram or whatever.
Who's now raising kids.
But that's the thing about women and wisdom.
You know? We get older and society sort of puts us out to pasture.
Men get older and they are distinguished, their gray hairs are, "Oh, sexy."
We're supposed to look like we did when we were 20, you know?
Or we're failing, right?
We are our wisest.
There is so much wisdom in women our age and older.
And all I'm saying to young women is make your kitchen table broad.
Make sure that it's not just a bunch of people your age.
And I do the same thing.
I have young people at my kitchen table, but I have elders.
There is so much we can learn about just being a woman, being human.
But we have to be open to the fact that women know a lot.
And we have to be open to that.
It's like it takes us this long
to be able to look over all of our successes and claim victory.
Men claim at-- They're 20. It's like, "I'm the man,"
and it's like, "You don't know anything either."
But we have to have raised kids, we have to have 50 million successes,
and just now, I can look over and go,
"I do know something. I was right. I am strategic."
"I was-- I'm good at this."
We don't give ourselves that credit as women until now.
Yes. And you help us do that through this.
But we all have it. We all have it in us, so...
As a parent, you often don't know when your lessons are getting through.
-Oh, yes. -Right?
And then you tell the story in The Light We Carry
about a time you and Barack went to visit the girls.
-Yes. -And they were in their new apartment.
And there was an a-ha moment with a coaster.
-Tell us about that moment. -Oh, yeah.
They invited us over for cocktails before dinner.
And so, this is the first time we're seeing--
They lived together, and they were adulting.
And it was so cool to watch.
They had furniture and, you know, they tried to make us some weak martinis.
-You know. -[woman laughs]
They had a charcuterie board,
even though Malia complained about the price of cheese.
She's like, "I didn't know it was this expensive."
I was like, "Oh, now, you counting money when it's your cheese. You--"
She would sidle up to our charcuterie board,
eat everything on it before the guests got there.
I was like, "Have some respect for the cost of charcuterie."
So we're having our little drinks
and we go to put our drinks on the table, and whoop!
They whip out some coasters.
I was like, "Oh, now you care about your cheap li'l table."
I was like, "I didn't see you whipping out coasters in the White House
when that-- on that 100-year-old, you know, side table,"
you know?
But it is good to see that they were listening.
And watching them in the background
discover dust, you know?
I mean, Malia's been fascinated by it.
It's like, "You know, I dust, and then days later, it's back."
-I'm like, "Yeah." -[Oprah] It works that way.
"That's why you gotta keep dusting," you know?
I think that the dream that you express for your daughters
was so poignant in The Light We Carry.
It's kind of a manifesto, I think, for the 21st century woman.
You say, "I don't want them to see marriage
as some kind of trophy to be hunted and won."
Yeah.
So can you tell us more about what that dream is for your--
Yeah. I want my girls to make choices
based on who they are and not who society says they should be.
Because we define what it means to be a happy human so narrowly.
And it doesn't fit everyone, and I think a lot of depression
and anxiety on both sides, young men and women, older men and women,
have to do with the fact that we're trying to cram our lives
into these narrow definitions.
You can only be happy if you find the love of your life
and get married, right?
Some people aren't built for marriage.
Some people may never find a partner that they love,
but there's happiness on the other side.
I mean, I know you've experienced this.
It's like how many people have come up and go,
-"Are you going to have a baby?" -Yes.
You know, it's like you got a number one TV show,
you're a kabillionaire, and it's almost like...
people are still like,
"Oh, but you're not a mother. I'm so sorry for you."
-Yes. -It's like, "No, Oprah's happy."
-Very. -"I've seen her."
-"She real happy." You know? -I'm doing all right. I'm doing all right.
-Yeah. -[crowd cheers]
But I want my girls and all young girls
to have the option of taking the time to discover
who they are and deciding who they want to be.
I think this is true for men too. Young boys.
There's such a narrow definition of what it means to be a man. You know?
What if you don't want to run a company? What if you are not naturally a leader?
What if you love working with your hands?
What if you want to stay home and be a stay-at-home dad?
Imagine all the CEOs out there--
This is why I think a lot of men are unhappy and angry
and they're trying to get power because they're not living their truth.
-I agree. -They're living some version
of what they think a man should be.
-Of what society says you should be. Yes. -Exactly.
So, I want us as parents to let our kids show us who they are
before we start imposing these,
-you know, our goals on to them... -Yeah.
...so that they can find some happiness.
I love how you end that piece
where you're talking about Malia and Sasha.
You ended the whole section saying,
-"I hope they find home." -Yes.
"I hope they find home."
You know, every time there's a discussion about politics
and who should run for president, your name comes up.
-[crowd cheers] -So why you bring it up?
So why are you bringing it up now, Oprah? What you trying to do?
This is why. I want you to-- So I was at a Sunday brunch
and some people were talking about it, and they were like,
"Well, perhaps maybe she would consider it."
"Do you think she'll ever consider it?" I say, "Guaranteed no."
So, can you tell the people why you will never even consider it?
Running for president.
You know, first of all, it was like I've never expressed
any interest in politics.
Ever.
Ever. I mean, I agreed to support my husband.
You know, he wanted to do it and he's been-- was great at it.
But at no point have I ever like, said,
"I think I want to run."
Ever. So I'm just wondering,
does what I want have anything to do with anything?
-That's nice. -Does who I choose to be, you know,
have anything to do with it?
Politics is hard, and it's--
And the people who get into it--
Just like marriage, just like kids, you got to want it!
It's got to be in your soul because it is so important.
It is not in my soul, you know.
Service is in my soul,
helping people is in my soul, working with kids, that's my...
I will spend my lifetime trying to make kids feel seen
and find their light.
That I will do.
-I don't have to hold office to do that. -Yeah.
In fact, I think I'm actually more effective outside of politics
because sadly, politics has become so divided.
You know, the minute you declare a party,
you've alienated the other half of the country, you know?
Now, maybe people who don't agree with me politically
can still gain some tools that can help them, you know?
Maybe I can help a kid who's a Republican, right?
Because maybe they'll listen to me. I think sadly, politics has limited us.
Now, we have to work ourselves out of that.
You know, we have to sort of get ourselves together
in how we view one another across party lines
because we are still one country.
You know, we have to be rooting for each other all the time.
We can't afford to be split and conquered.
But that won't be me.
I will not be the one politically doing that.
And I don't think you could wear those black leather pants either.
I certainly can't! So there. That's that.
So, before reading The Light We Carry,
I was feeling, and I know so many of you were feeling this too,
because we have all these conversations about how bad things are
-when we're with our friends. -Yeah.
And I think a lot of us were feeling like you felt before you wrote it,
that there are so many massive problems,
there's so many things that need to be overcome,
and it feels like there's a conspiracy of craziness going on out here.
So how do we get back to trust?
Yeah.
Trusting our government, trusting each other...
-Yeah. -...in a way
that doesn't make us feel numbed and tired all the time.
Yeah. I think we can't underestimate
what quarantine did to exacerbate that
because we were isolated from each other, physically.
And while, to some, that felt good.
It's like, "Whew, I am so tired of people," right?
I think we need to be with each other, you know.
We really do.
I think when we gather
and we mix our togetherness, you know,
we feel better, you know?
We feel better--
Don't you all feel better just being here tonight?
-Don't you feel better? Tuesday night? -And we haven't been able to do that.
I always say it's harder to hate up close.
And we have been isolated from each other.
We're just hearing about each other from the news and from our feeds.
And my experience with this country
is that it's a distortion of the truth of who we are.
I have traveled all around this country,
in communities of all different races,
and socioeconomic backgrounds, and political affiliations,
and people have...
across the board, been kind and decent to me,
to my family, once they get to know us.
They may not agree, but we are not the people that we see on TV,
and I just want us to remember that.
That we should never fear each other.
Everyone-- There are the outliers of people who are struggling deeply,
but the vast majority of people are like Toot and Gramps, and Mom and Dad.
They are hardworking, honest, decent people
who are not entitled,
who are grateful, who are proud Americans,
who are willing to work hard, who tell the truth.
That's who our country is, and...
But we have to have leaders...
[sighs] that reflect that back.
You know?
It is dangerous when our leadership says something different.
I love the beginning of the book.
You have this poem by Alberto Ríos that says,
"If someone in your family tree was trouble,
a hundred were not."
"The bad do not win."
"Not finally."
"No matter how loud they are."
"We simply would not be here if that were so."
It's simple truth.
So that brings us to the phrase that has become synonymous with your name,
"When they go low, we go high."
"We go high."
And you say that going high
usually involves taking a pause
before you react to anything. Correct?
-Absolutely. -Okay.
So, what has happened recently in your life or in the country
that you had to step back and say, "Let me pause and try to get to high"?
There's plenty in the world that makes me mad, you know.
-Wait a minute. Can I just ask you this? -Yes.
Do you go high immediately?
-Oh, no, no, no. No. -Okay.
No, that's what the kitchen table is for, remember?
I go sit at my kitchen table and we have a "go low session."
-[Oprah laughs] -You know?
We just go low. We are all picking ourselves off the floor.
-Okay. -I used to do this thing with my staff
in the White House where before I would give a speech
or do an interview,
we'd mock answer the questions
because they knew I needed to get the low out, you know.
-So I would have-- -Don't we feel better knowing that?
Oh, yeah. I would just play out what I would call
"Presidential ending statements" that I could make.
I'd be like, "You know what?"
"We could just go home if I said 'burr,'" right?
And my team would look and go,
"Yeah, don't do that." You know?
But sometimes, you know...
so going high doesn't mean you don't feel the rage, right?
It doesn't mean that you're not supposed to feel.
It doesn't mean that you are complacent
in unfairness and inequality.
It doesn't mean you don't do the work.
It's just the choice of your approach.
And going high is a choice.
It's a choice that I think is most mature.
It's a long-term choice.
And it's not you just wallowing in the gut feeling
of what you feel that... at that moment, that's self-indulgent.
And when you're a leader with a platform,
we can't afford to indulge our innermost ugly, right?
We have a responsibility to go high because we are living--
We've lived through leadership that goes low
and no one feels good in that.
It doesn't lead to solutions. It just doesn't work.
So I answer-- in the book, by answering the question
that everybody has been asking me,
"Still go high, Michelle? Now? Really? Really?"
And my answer is, "Yes, absolutely."
"We always go high. We go high..."
"...but we do the work."
And that's what I want young people to know,
that the light we carry is in all of us,
you know, we have to learn how to build it up in ourselves first.
We can't look to other people to build it up in us
because sometimes, they don't have it in them.
And once we build it up, we have to protect it, you know?
Protect it with a good kitchen table, keeping people in,
but also letting people go when they're not serving you for the best.
-When they're losing oxygen. -When they're losing oxygen, you know.
You have to protect yourself from the poison that's out there.
You've got to get out of other people's mirrors, right?
And then once you've buttressed yourself and you've got it together,
then it's our responsibility to share that light.
That's the going high part.
So as you think about interacting,
speaking out, texting, using social media,
think about the light you carry.
Lead with that light
because light begets light, hope begets hope.
Going high begets more of it.
That's why we do it.
Thank you for reminding us of the light we carry. Michelle Obama!
-Thank you, Oprah Winfrey! -The YouTube Theater!
When all through the city They cased each and every neighborhood
Did that rhyme? Is "'twas" even a word?
Look, here's the thing.
Our story is set when the Bad Guys were still bad, okay?
And at the best time of the year, when all the good heists can be had.
All right, guys, what's tomorrow?
The Bad Guys Holiday Heist-tacular! [cackles]
[in unison] The Bad Guys Holiday Heist-tacular!
What does that mean?
While all these normies stay home with their loved ones, or whatever…
…this place turns into a ghost town! No guards, no fuzz.
This city's our heisting stage!
And we're gonna clean it out.
Oh, it's a Bad Guys tradition.
And so is spending the day before
coming up with a list of everything we're going to steal Christmas morning.
Ooh, I want to hit that place with all the stinky cheese.
No reason. I-I don't even like it.
-Okay, I like it a little! -Cheesy Dan's is on the list.
City… Corporate… Bank.
Oh, yeah. That's what we've been waiting all year for.
It's gonna be the cherry on top of our criminal sundae.
Tomorrow morning, it, and everything else in this city, will be ours.
-[whooping] -[Shark] That's what I'm talking about!
Tiffany Fluffit here with the moment we've all been waiting for.
Our beloved Big Nick has just made his first appearance.
I think I speak for the entire city when I say…
I love you, Big Nick!
[man] Hey, hey! This street's closed!
It's the Bad Guys!
Better get a move on it, Wolfie.
I think we just stole Santa.
Nice!
The Bad Guys are stealing Big Nick!
Help! -[woman] Someone stop them! -[Wolf] Ah!
That's very not good.
This isn't that famous balloon everybody's freakishly emotionally attached to, is it?
No, no, no. This is a different giant Santa-shaped balloon.
-[sighs] -Of course it is!
-[Wolf] I can't see! -Get it off of me!
-[Piranha] The lights! -[Shark] Santa's hugging me!
[Wolf] Ha-ha! See ya, Santa!
[woman] No! Not Big Nick!
Tiffany Fluffit reporting live from the scene of the worst attack on this city
since the introduction of electric scooters.
Our beloved Big Nick has been destroyed by the notoriously notorious Bad Guys.
We're a city in mourning this morning.
[wailing] Why?
Why indeed. It's a senseless act of bah-humbuggery.
All attempts to wash the abomination off have only made it more terrifying,
further lowering holiday spirits.
It's never felt less like Christmas in the city.
Sir, your reaction?
It's just not the holidays without Big Nick. [sniffles]
He was like a father to me. Don't think I'll even celebrate tomorrow.
Probably just go into work, guard the bank like any other day,
and be extra attentive to distract myself from this monstrosity.
Why can't I look away?
You heard it here first. Christmas is canceled.
This can't be happening!
The whole point of Christmas morning
is that no one is around to stop us from maximum heisting!
B-b-but we were gonna rob the bank!
And now we can't because of some dumb Santa?
[gasps] You take that back right now!
Santa is a criminal hero who deserves our respect, in balloon form or otherwise.
He's broken into more homes than anyone and never been caught.
What's even the point of anything?
Unless… And hear me out on this.
If we set our clocks back 24 hours and go to sleep right now,
maybe, when we wake up, none of this will have happened.
Yeah? Come on. Night, night!
If destroying the Santa balloon was all it took to cancel Christmas,
then all we have to do is recreate it, and boom, Christmas is back!
That's the sound of all our problems being solved,
because I've already made something better.
Built this bad boy for our Christmas morning bank job.
I was gonna surprise you all tomorrow, but you can call me a genius now.
-Check it. -[beep]
Uh, it is surprising, for sure.
[Webs] The normies will forget about their balloon
once they lay their eyes on this beaut.
And it captures Santa's true nature.
None of that jolly business.
The suit really should be operated by a driver.
Come on. Wolfie, try him on.
Oh, that's… Uh, I'm good. Thanks, though.
And as great as this is,
the jolly component of Jolly Old Saint Nick
is probably why non-criminal folks like him.
[whispering] Don't listen. You're perfect.
If we all work together,
I'm sure a bunch of criminal masterminds like us can make one silly Santa balloon.
Even I'm a little offended by this.
[Piranha] His beard looks like a tentacle.
I feel scandalized.
Okay, lost some time there, but we'll figure out another way
Okay, lost some time there, but we'll figure out another way to cheer up the city in time to rob it in the morning.
to cheer up the city in time to rob it in the morning.
Which, sure, is in, like, 12 hours, so lay it on me.
Which, sure, is in, like, 12 hours, so lay it on me. What else says holiday spirit?
Stealing whatever we want, because, normally, guards take the day off.
But no, not this year.
They'll be at work, ruining the only good thing about Christmas.
Only good thing?
What about all the classic Christmas criminals?
The Grinch? Hans Gruber? Ebenezer Scrooge!
That guy's a legend. He parties with ghosts and wears a dress to bed.
And yet, his story has never been properly told.
So I propose that we put on a show for the whole city, with me as Scrooge… and all the other characters.
with me as Scrooge… and all the other characters.
But without that needy, nefarious Tiny Tim tearing Scrooge down!
And I would buy a ticket to that show,
but we gotta stick to the awful stuff people like-- [screams]
Ooh, my favorite part of the holidays is getting a lump of coal.
It really makes me feel like I'm making good choices, you know?
The Naughty List is a badge of honor.
-Maybe we can get everyone some coal. -[Wolf] Piranha! -You're a genius! -I am?
-You're a genius! -I am? -We're going to play Santa. -No, no, no. Let me get this straight.
-We're going to play Santa. -No, no, no. Let me get this straight. Are you suggesting we give instead of take?
Think of it this way. We'll steal the gifts from the big department store,
and then break into houses to leave them.
That sounds a lot like Robin Hood, who is notoriously good.
Ugh! That guy's the worst. He ruined tights for me.
We're doing good for the greater bad.
If folks have presents waiting for them, they'll stay home on Christmas morning,
and our Holiday Heist-tacular can live again.
Uh, yeah. Uh, we also have to deal with this.
[yelling] After the balloon incident, the radio station stopped playing Christmas music,
and is broadcasting something called Doom Tunes instead!
-[music stops] -Which isn't helping holiday spirit.
If someone can get into the recording studio to help,
I could hack the station's antenna and stream my sweet Santa mix.
Good idea, Webs.
All right, guys. Let's go do some good, so we can be bad.
Here's the plan. Piranha will help Webs get to the antenna so she can hack it.
Shark will infiltrate the radio station and distract the DJ
so she doesn't notice Webs is taking over the feed with holiday music.
Finally, Snake and I will steal gifts from the department store,
to then break in and leave them in unsuspecting houses.
And that was "No, No, No, Noel" by Death Anchor.
Bah humbug! Am I right? [chuckles]
Scrooge?
Uh, look, man, if you're here to teach me the meaning of Christmas,
I'm not interested.
Don't you dare give the Right Dishonorable Ebenezer Scrooge the horn!
Buddy, I don't work with sidekicks.
I kick no one's sides! Unless it's that annoying brat, Tiny Tim.
This should be a breeze. All you have to do is break into the house and leave it.
[hisses] Fine. Let's get this over with.
Well, I definitely did it. We can go now.
What? You never seen an ab before?
Cough it up.
Come on.
Gimme a break. Giving, not taking, is unnatural. [sighs] I'll do it.
[sighs] I'll do it. Watch and learn.
See?
-Piece of cake. -So, what's that, then?
-Piece of cake. -So, what's that, then? What's what?
Get ready to sign off… 'cause I've been itching for a fight.
And, you know, you look a lot like that shark from the gang who took down Big Nick.
Me? No! [clears throat] I am Scrooge. -See? Muttonchops? -Ha-ha!
Shark, why did you cut the station's feed?
[shrieks] I didn't! Well, I did, b-but she made me!
Police channel's full of chatter about the station cutting out.
You got to fill the dead air before they figure out what we're doing up here.
Truly, nothing I would love more.
And I do have material prepared, but I kind of have my hands full here.
-[whimpers] -[Piranha] Patch me in.
You? I-I mean… you?
Patch… me… in.

Is Christmas un-canceled?
After the unexpected carols
and some secret Santas leaving presents all through the city,
holiday spirit is up.
But is it enough to fill the Big Nick-sized hole in our hearts?
Stay tuned to find out.
Nice going, fin bro!
What if it wasn't enough?
If folks don't stay home to celebrate tomorrow, we can't clean the city out.
If folks don't stay home to celebrate tomorrow, we can't clean the city out. Wolfie, it's late.
Look, we did the best we could. -If not this year, there's always next. -No.
We… W-we just need something big to push the holiday spirit in the city over the edge.
Oh, you can stop dropping hints now, Wolf.
I'll do it.
I'll perform my one-shark Christmas villains showcase.
I don't know where I'm gonna find 20 tons of fake snow,
but I'm a professional, baby, so I will find a way.
Shark, that's it! If we made it snowy, the holiday spirit would be undeniable.
There would be no stopping us then.
Finally, a chance to hack the atmosphere! I actually have an app for that.
We're good with a little collateral flooding, right?
Or we just steal the snow machine at the ski resort?
-We'll never get there and back in time. -[Snake] What about that?
We use the shaved ice machine to make snow.
Not as exciting as altering Earth's weather through atmospheric geoengineering, but I think I can make it work.
through atmospheric geoengineering, but I think I can make it work.
Oh, thank you, thank you. I'm all turned around.
Oh, thank you, thank you. I'm all turned around. First, Christmas is canceled. Now, maybe it's back on.
First, Christmas is canceled. Now, maybe it's back on. So I rebuy everything.
W-what flavor can I get you?
Uh, please describe them to me in great detail
while I interrupt with all sorts of unnecessary questions.
Does Mistletoe Mint taste more like missiles or toes?
It tastes like mint.
[gasps] Please maintain eye contact with me at all times!
Oh, wait. Well, I… I require trustworthiness from all my frozen-delicacy suppliers.
When I give you the signal, turn the dial up. A five should do it.
-[laughs] -All set, Wolfie. [Webs] Fire her up.
Nothing's gonna get in the way of our Holiday Heist-tacular.
Tiffany Fluffit reporting live from the scene of an unexpected winter wonderland.
It may not be real, but what in this town is?
In fact, it's never felt more like the holidays in the city.
Christmas is officially back on!
It's beautiful! We did it. We really did it.
It makes me feel all warm inside.
So merry and b-bright,
like someone lit a candle in the cold cavern of my heart.
[grunts] If you like that sort of thing. Which I don't. I do not.
She's gonna blow!
[woman] That psychic was right!
[sighs] That's not good.
It's too cold!
For a brief moment, it looked like the holidays were back on,
but that moment has passed.
A frozen vortex is spinning out of control downtown.
Will it suck in all surrounding life?
That's not going to happen. Probably.
As long as you didn't turn the dial all the way up. Wolf?
I-I figured a ten would be twice the holiday spirit?
-What? -Why, I ought to…
-You're lucky my fins are frozen! -I'm too talented to die!
That vortex is about to suck in the city! No time to be mad at me!
That vortex is about to suck in the city! No time to be mad at me! I'll make time. Everything was fine.
I'll make time. Everything was fine. But no, you had to go and push things too far, like always!
I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just, stealing with you all Christmas morning
It's just, stealing with you all Christmas morning is the highlight of my year.
I got so wrapped up in making sure our Holiday Heist-tacular happened
that I put you at risk. And that's the last thing I'd ever want to do.
-Yo, get a life. -That's gross.
-These are theatrical tears. -Yeah, fine, whatever.
Better stop that machine,
or it won't just be our Holiday Heist-tacular that's canceled.
Webs, can't you, like, hack your device?
Oh, yeah, sure. Why didn't I think of that?
Of course I can't hack it!
Think I'd leave security loopholes in my own tech?
The only way to stop it is to unplug it.
Then that's what we do.
Fin bro!
Cover your eyes! Don't look at me!
If Shark's not strong enough, who is?
I know who.
The situation has worsened.
-Oh! -[man screams]
-[pounding footsteps in distance] -Are you seeing this?
[Wolf] Not that way! How do I…
[Webs] Ah, you have to relax. The suit is intuitive.
Don't force it.
Just walk.
Whoa! Folks, we're witnessing some sort of Christmas miracle.
A Santa cyborg appears to be attempting to save the city!
-[Piranha grunts] -I got you!
One at a time, folks. Please, form a line.
Balloon Santa may have gone up in flames, but the city has a new Santa mascot.
That's right, Robo-Claus is a huge mech robot that screams family fun.
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Webs, they really love your Santa.
Maybe too much. These people gotta get home if we're to pull our morning Holiday Heist-tacular.
These people gotta get home if we're to pull our morning Holiday Heist-tacular.
Shark, I patched your comms into the suit.
He's no Scrooge, but think you could play Santa?
[over Robo-Claus speaker] Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! Happy Holidays!
Now, it's late, so everyone go to bed,
because Santa commands that everyone celebrate tomorrow in their homes,
and not at their security guard jobs.
-Ho-ho-ho! -I'll do it.
-Ho-ho-ho! -I'll do it. I'll stay home for you, Robo-Claus. Please be proud of me.
We did it!
-The Bad Guys saved Christ-- [sneezes] -[groaning]
I can't believe that, after all that, we're too si--
…we're too sick to pull off our Holiday Heist-tacular.
How about a new holiday tradition?
No more traditions or holidays. Bah hu-- [sneezes, sniffles]
[shrieks] What… is… that?
Oh, no. I think they're presents.
Like, for us?
Must have done so much good for the city that we ended up on Santa's Nice List.
I'm gonna be sick!
The shame!
Not only did that bearded freak have the gall to break into our lair,
he goes and gives us presents, not coal!
Wait. Is that stinky cheese? How did he know?
The Bad Guys will be the laughing stock of the criminal community.
I'll never be able to show my face again.
This will not stand.
We need to start planning now.
Next year, we are going to heist the North Pole
and show Santa that the Bad Guys belong on the Naughty List.
[Wolf] And so, yeah The Bad Guys stole Christmas From ourselves
And Santa deemed us good little elves
The first time you fall in love.
The first time you meet your in-laws.
The first time you…
Okay, you all know what I'm talking about.
Becoming a parent for the very first time.
What a blessing!
Especially when you are living in a paradise called Mauritius.
They say it's all happiness.
But why I must lie?
It can get on your nerves too.
But wait.
You all think I'm talking about the baby?
Prishen is giving me a grandchild. Ah!
What more can I ask for?
Yes, my daughter's having a baby.
[giggles] Hey.
Can you believe it's only three more days?
-I can't wait to get onto that plane. -Mauritius, here we come!
It's a girl, guaranteed.
I'm 100% certain it's gonna be a boy.
Thank you. Thank you.
[Aya] I'm talking about the grandparents.
When they come into the picture, it's like one roller-coaster ride.
-Well, I'm praying for Jodi's looks. -Prishen's brains.
-She's such a beauty queen. -He's a doctor.
There is no doubt the Kandasamy genes will win, hands down.
100% Naidoo baby, through and through.
-♪ Come into the boom, boom ♪ -♪ Boom, boom ♪
-Take a deep breath in and out. -[Shanthi breathing deeply]
That's it. That's it. Just relax. Another one. Another one.
-[inhales] Breathe in. -[calming music playing]
You got this. Come on. You got this.
I can't do this, Jen.
[sighs] Shanthi, come on. We don't have any option.
I mean, look at this. You left it so long, it looks like the Amazon forest.
Yeah, you can make plaits, man.
-Not at my age, man. -Okay, Shanthi, just look at me.
-Not at my age, man. -Okay, Shanthi, just look at me. Think happy thoughts. Think… Think Mauritius.
Mauritius.
-[Jennifer] And the baby. -The baby.
-Think-- -[clattering]
Ma. Ma?
Put that down now. This is not your house.
Who died and made you queen of this house?
So much for happy thoughts.
I just can't wait to see my Prishen.
But the best part is my granddaughter is gonna be sleeping with me.
Uh-uh. I've already ordered a cot for my grandson.
Hmm. It's still gonna happen. Over my dead body.
-[Aya] Better you than me. -"My dead body."
We just need to steer them in the right direction.
Once they've had the baby, it's done. Then they can just focus--
-On baby number two. -[Jennifer] Oh, Shanthi.
Not like you, Jen, one-stop shop.
Like me.
One, two, cha-cha-cha. One, two…
[Jennifer] Okay, Ms. Cha-cha-cha. I have a better idea.
[Shanthi] Yeah?
I think you actually need to have a Brazilian.
We're going Brazil?
I thought we're going to Mauritius.
Yeah, but just make sure everything in the house is in its place please.
Your mom's gonna rearrange things anyway.
[sighs] Yeah, but then she'll do it and just judge me for it.
Relax, I've got you. Okay.
[Shanthi] Right, guys. Who wants a tinned fish sandwich?
And I made my famous Cornish chicken biryani.
-[Jennifer] It's not a food festival. -Everybody's hungry.
It's a beach trip.
You can't see? Game's on.
[Desan] Ma? You saw? I scored two goals.
You can only make that announcement when you get two A's in school, okay?
-[Jennifer] Shanthi! -Jen, he scraped a pass.
Me too. Scraping by.
[whispering] That's because God takes the good ones first.
You're gonna go last.
-Aunty Jennifer? -Uh-huh.
Can you please tell my ma I also want to come see the baby?
Desan, this trip is not about you. It's about your brother.
And I'm so tired of you, like a broken record,
"I want to go to Mauritius. I want Prishen's room." Just stop it.
Okay, Ma. But if I save this one, can I at least get Prishen's room?
Okay, okay, man.
You ready?
Of course, he's gonna save it.
When the only thing this one might kick is the bucket.
On my deathbed and still scoring.
Don't Messi with me.
Desan, why are you so stupid? You don't even know which way to go, huh?
If Prishen was here, he would've covered the whole goalpost.
And you can kiss Prishen's room goodbye.
[Prishen] Hey.
Ready? Let's do this.
-How's that feeling? -Tight. [chuckles]
Those two can be such a handful.
We should have code words for when we need saving.
When the enemy is advancing.
-I'm thinking… -Mm-hmm?
Maybe "hurricane" for your mom and maybe "volcano" for my mom,
because she keeps everything in.
-I like that. -[both laugh]
-Finally! -What?
-Here you go. -Here.
We're gonna have a quick meeting since the shuttle is late.
Elvis.
-[Preggie] A meeting? -Yeah.
When we're going on holiday?
Uh, anybody want a samosa?
Okay, stop-- Shanthi, what the hell is wrong with you?
And you, Preggie, news flash, it's not a holiday.
Jennifer, why are you sounding like a police officer?
-It burns. Whoo! [winces] -[exhaling] There we go. All right.
-[chuckles] Come on. -The baby's heavy.
All right, almost there. Let's do this.
All right, let's breathe in and out.
-[both breathing deeply] -It's burning. -That's all right. -[liquid dripping]
-Oh shit. My water just broke. -It's happening.
If you look at your notes, I made a clear schedule.
It's listed very clearly, day one, day two, day three,
right till the end.
And also, there are some helpful tips on how to greet the locals.
Why? We can't just say "hello"?
-Uh, Jennifer? -Yes, Preggie?
How do we do this? "Maintain a peaceful and calm atmosphere at all times."
[Elvis] Hey.
Bonjour, Preggie.
Oh! Bonsoir, Elvis.
Elvis!
Guys, this is not a joke. It takes a village to raise a child.
It took a granny to raise Jodi. Shots fired.
Jennifer, why we don't just take it one day at a time?
-Yeah, Jennifer. We're going to Mauritius. -[Jennifer sighs heavily] And you're acting like a killjoy.
Anyone got a knife?
Why, Aya?
Slit my wrists right now.
Elvis, how long more?
Ma, we just left home.
I can't wait to see my son in eight hours. I'm bursting with excitement.
I'm bursting here.
Ma, didn't I tell you to go before we left home?
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
-They're on their way to the airport. -Prishen! Prishen! Do we have--
-They're on their way to the airport. -Prishen! Prishen! Do we have-- -Relax. -Okay.
We've got the music. We've got the oils. Everything is gonna be perfect.
-[Jodi groans] -You're gonna be perfect. Let's go. Come here.
Hmm. That looks like a funeral nightie, Jen.
-What? -That's terrible. Wait. Check here.
This is mine.
Clearly, you don't know Jodi at all. She's just like me. Less is more.
Me too. The less I see of some people, the more happy I get.
Okay, let's breathe. [inhales deeply]
Oh, contraction. Contraction, contraction. [groans]
-Let's breathe. -[breathing deeply]
Right, guys. Final checks, eh. No sharp objects in the bag.
What if you have a sharp tongue?
[Elvis] And nothing flammable too.
[Aya] Only Jennifer's hot flashes.
[Elvis] Yeah, final bet, my man. Hey, boy or girl? Fifty bucks.
A boy.
Definitely a boy.
[tuts] Girl.
And if I win, what… what do I get?
Why are we even having this conversation? Obviously, I'm gonna win.
-Okay, Miss Confidence. -Mm-hmm.
But if I win, I get to choose the prize. Deal?
[pilot] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Mauritius.
[Shanthi] This airport is very quiet, huh?
Oh, just shut up.
You shouldn't even be opening your damn mouth.
I mean, I'm so embarrassed. I'm an upstanding citizen,
and to be held at customs like that and searched!
Hey, lucky they never searched me. I've got some dangerous goods here.
Like a common criminal.
Okay, that's it, guys. Stop, all right?
My poor child must be roasting in the sun there.
Everybody, look. He'll be carrying a big sign.
The sign will say, "Welcome trouble and bigger trouble."
Hey, there is he.
Ah, Prishen looks so different. It must be my cataracts.
Where's my Prishen?
My name is Moothoo, and I'll be your guide for the next few weeks.
[Jennifer] Guide?
We won't be needing a guide.
We need Prishen.
There has been a medical emergency.
Please. He's not even a surgeon. Come on.
[in Mauritian Creole] Good morning. Welcome--
[in English] Huh-uh, just hold on.
Listen… [chuckles awkwardly] I'm here to settle you all in. Eh?
Drese patout. Allez! Allez!
[chuckles] There you go.
[Shanthi] Jen, he's not messaging. He's not calling or anything.
It's very unlike him. Please try Jodi.
Jodi? No, no, no, no, no! No Jodi.
Look at our baby.
Aw! Look at my granddaughter.
I feel like I've just won the jackpot.
Isn't, Jen?
And, Jodi, that nightie is just too cute. Perfect choice.
[whispering] It's just ugly.
Too lovely dress.
It's ugly.
You okay, sweetheart? Hmm?
-Oh my God! Look at her. -[Shanthi] Look at her.
[Jennifer gasps] How gorgeous!
And just now, I'll have a grandson, and we'll have the perfect pigeon pair.
-Uh-uh, Shanthi, what is wrong with you? -What?
My child has literally just given birth.
-Please! -[Shanthi] Yeah! Nice like that.
Then they can grow up together. Isn't it, momos?
-Just… Okay. -Prishen. Prishen.
-Jodi needs to get some rest. -Of course darling. Of course.
-I can't wait to see their house. -Me too. Absolutely.
Actually, you're not staying with us.
-Huh. -What?
Merci beaucoup.
Uh, Ma, Aunty Jen, have something.
Uh, son, this resort looks expensive. Eh?
-This is not a holiday, huh? -Absolutely.
We're here to maintain a calm and peaceful atmosphere.
[Preggie] At all times.
[Aya] Yeah, Prishen, we thought we're gonna sleep lakeside by your house.
Isn't, Jennifer? Isn't, Shanthi?
Just, you know, relax and enjoy.
We're not here for enjoyment, my boy.
It takes a village, son.
And we are the village. We have the day planned day by day.
Moothoo will be with you all full-time, and everything's been booked and paid for.
What more can we ask for, son?
[Prishen] I've got these itineraries for each day.
Aunty Jen.
[Aya] The way Jennifer also likes to plan.
So nice, Prishen.
Day one, day two, day three.
So organized!
Meeting adjourned.
-What the hell just happened? -What do you mean?
-Did we come here for fun? -Why are you getting so worked up?
-Looks like a tough group. -Nah, let me guide you.
There's Shanthi, crybaby.
Are these children off their bloody heads?
A few screws loose here and there.
Our first grandchild is here, and they expect us to go sightseeing.
Then there's her husband, Preggie. A bit slow.
Come on, this holiday must have cost Prishen a packet.
-Big cheapskate too. -We can't waste his money.
Money, money, money. That's Jennifer for you.
She can be a real pain in the…
Ass. Total ass! That's what he is.
Big boss. Short fuse, very cranky.
Since when is Prishen our boss?
Well, I think what the kids did is quite thoughtful.
Ah, my Elvis. Cool as one cucumber.
Can you calm down? You're acting like a crazy woman.
Don't tell me to calm down, Preggie. Are you mad or what?
What do Jodi and Prishen know about bringing up a child? Hmm?
What did we do to deserve this?
To deserve a fully paid holiday?
They know nothing, Elvis. N-O-T-H-I-N-G. Nothing.
You don't have to S-P-E-L-L it out for me.
Oh, just shut up! Can't you see they're trying to shut us out?
Jen, this is a life-changing moment for them.
This is a life-changing moment for me, Preggie.
-Plus, you got the new Brazilian-- -[Shanthi] Absolutely not.
[both] I'm a grandmother now.
How are you feeling, Grandma?
How're you feeling, Aya?
[sighs] I just wish we could hold our baby.
You think we should call Jodi?
We could.
[spluttering] Only to see how she is.
Okay.
[woman in French] Jodi's phone. Hello. Who's this?
[woman in French] Jodi's phone. Hello. Who's this? [in English] It's a nurse. Um, this is Jodi's mom. Is Jodi there?
[in English] It's a nurse. Um, this is Jodi's mom. Is Jodi there?
Oh, Aunty Jen. It's Anjali here.
Anjali?
-Uh, Anjali… -[whispering indistinctly]
[Jennifer] Are you at the hospital with Jodi?
[Anjali] No, no. They've just come home. I'm here to help.
Ask them what time.
Shh. Um, um, Anjali… -[whispering indistinctly] -Is it possible for me to speak to Jodi?
[Anjali] Not right now. Allez, bye.
-She cut the call? -She cut the call.
The audacity!
-They didn't even do the prayers, Jen! -Yeah, but forget about all that.
This self-appointed spokesperson, Anjali… whatever.
Who are the mothers here?
-This nonsense has to stop right now. -Hmm.
[Elvis] I hope you guys checked your schedules.
[Aya] Which one? Jennifer's or Prishen's?
[Jennifer] Ugh! That boy is absolutely clueless.
He has us covering every damn corner of this island.
-Hey, I love it. -Yeah, me too.
Today, you, me, cigars, one, two whiskeys on the Seven Sands.
-That's what I came here for. -That's what you came for?
-[phone ringing] -You and Elvis…
birds of a feather.
Howzit, my boy?
[Desan on phone] Dad, where's Mommy?
Yeah, I'm fine too.
Desan, are you eating properly?
-Why do you look like that? -Nothing, Ma.
-[Shanthi] You okay? -Nothing happened.
Desan, what I said about lies?
Some boys were just playing rough, and I got hurt.
Wait. Somebody is bullying you?
Elvis, you want the dhal puri?
Okay, okay, Ma, please stop that. That's really annoying.
Like some people I know.
-What did I say? -[Elvis] Jen.
Guys. Preggie, look here. See what these monsters did to our baby.
[tuts] Don't worry, doll. It's a small injury.
Shanthi, that's like a scratch, man.
Don't worry, Shanthi. He'll be fine.
Considering Desan's size, they took quite a chance with him.
Aya, size doesn't matter.
Oh, that's what you think.
Checking to see if she's breathing, babe?
Hmm. I'm just trying to breast-pump again.
Ooh. Um, should I maybe call the moms for some extra backup?
Bru, check these photos of the Seven Sands.
It's one of the seven wonders of Mauritius.
-Now we have the eighth. -Ah.
This man here has been dreaming about the Seven Sands
for I don't know how long.
Me too. What a dream I had!
Jennifer got swallowed by the Seven Sands.
[inhales] Um, shall we go?
Moothoo.
Listen.
Change of plan.
No, madame, we'll miss the Seven Sands. It is one of the--
Seven wonders of Mauritius. I get that. I heard you,
and I honestly don't care.
Madame, Mr. Preggie wants so badly to see the Seven--
Okay, Moothoo, just listen to me carefully.
Firstly, Mr. Preggie is an idiot who needs seven claps.
And secondly, I will pay you.
In dollars.
You mean like a service fee?
Exactly that. A tip.
Madame, just write your name on it and put it in the cubby.
Drese patout.
What does that mean?
"Drese patout"?
It means "everything is good."
It is indeed.
[Elvis] Moothoo, is this the way to the Seven Sands?
[Jennifer] I'm sure the driver knows which route to take, Elvis.
[Elvis] I think you missed a turn.
[Shanthi] We're here.
Where's our baby?
-[Elvis] How'd this happen? -[Preggie] You're asking me?
I didn't sleep last night. I was so excited about the Seven Sands.
Hi.
[Anjali] Oh, everyone.
What a surprise!
Welcome, everybody.
And you are?
Anjali. I live next door.
What a lovely young lady! Like a godmother for the baby.
I'll take her. Who needs a godmother when we have two grandmothers here?
Oh, look at her. This is right where she belongs, with her grandmother.
I can't believe that you brought the baby into the house without doing any prayers.
Who does she look like? [Aya] Definitely not Shanthi and Jennifer.
More like a mini-Elvis. Lucky fish.
Would you all like some chai?
Would you?
You are the guest after all.
-Elvis and I would like some. -[Anjali] Sure.
Jen, what's wrong with you?
What is wrong with you? You're suffocating all of us.
What is wrong with you? You want bad wind to catch the baby?
That bad wind caught my son long ago.
[Shanthi] Tell her, Aya.
[Aya gasping] I can't breathe. I'm going now.
[Shanthi] Yeah, just…
You shouldn't be having these here. It's just gonna encourage snacking.
[Jennifer] Chevda is a bit stale.
-I always tell you homemade is best. -Definitely.
[in Mauritian Creole] Your mother is a witch! Hurricane!
Yours is a devil. Volcano!
-Oui, oui! -[both laugh]
[in English] Hey! That sounds so nice. What are you saying?
It means that it's such a blessing to have you guys here.
[Shanthi] Jodi, so quickly you're giving the bottle.
Breast is best if you want a healthy child.
[sighs] I'm… I'm trying. I'm trying so hard.
Try a bit harder.
Eat all the right things and put garlic in everything.
Don't give up so easily.
-Leave her, man. -[Shanthi] What "leave her, man"?
Everything is dry. She's not even squirting.
[muffled] What's squirting?
[Jennifer] Stop pressurizing Jodi.
You know, I bottle-fed you, and look at how well you turned out.
[Shanthi] And look at Prishen. Hmm?
I breastfed him till the time he was five years old.
-[laughs awkwardly] -What?
Jodi clearly does not want to breastfeed.
Oh, actually, Ma, I want to do both.
-See? -No, you don't.
Jodi, do what works for you. Baby and you will find your own rhythm.
Oh. Are you a nurse, Anjali?
I'll be monitoring you, Jodi.
[Shanthi] So, Jodi, exactly, um,
how much breast and how much bottle are you giving? Say 50/50?
She felt ambushed.
[Preggie] Son, we also felt ambushed.
The weather messed us up.
They just bulldoze their way in.
I was looking and looking by the window for the Seven Sands.
Dad, this can't happen again.
Just leave it to us.
Hey, what's my mother and Moothoo up to there?
[Preggie] Looking really cozy if you ask me.
Dad, Uncle Elvis, I can count on you guys, right?
-I said we'll sort it out, all right? -[Prishen sighs]
Hey, hey, now they're kissing.
Check there. Check there.
[Elvis] Hey.
Hey, you don't think Moothoo and my mother are…
[both] Nah!
Seriously?
Firstly, it's this Desan school problem.
Then I didn't pin this pocketknife on the baby.
[muffled] Oh, that's bad luck, man.
Yeah. Eish! I'm getting it from all sides.
That baby needs this knife. Plus, too, it's our custom.
-[sighs] -Who will take us?
I don't know.
Moothoo?
[muffled] I'm looking for my teeth, man.
What a stupid name, Anjali.
And to think she's got more baby time than us, Jen.
I know.
-"Can I make you all some chai?" -[Jen sighs disgustedly]
You know, I felt something was off with her from the beginning.
-You also felt it? -Mm-hmm.
I thought it was just me.
Hi, Rani.
Oh, yeah, it's… it's a bit loud here. Yeah, what's that?
Wait, what?
No, it can't be.
Never.
[sighs] Saw my moves? Aya on the dance floor. [laughs]
[Shanthi] Preggs.
They're now saying that Desan wasn't bullied.
They're saying that Desan is the bully.
[Aya] Same thing I'm saying.
Who's gonna tackle him with his size? Hefty fella like that.
You know what? I think somebody's framing Desan.
Our poor baby.
Shanthi, he's not a baby anymore.
Yeah, but he's not Prishen. He needs guidance.
[Jennifer] Elvis.
Elvis.
Elvis?
Desan, listen to me, huh?
You got to tell me exactly what happened.
Right. Because there's a lot of stories going on about you. -Ma, I'm so scared. -You can't be scared now, Desan.
-Ma, I'm so scared. -You can't be scared now, Desan.
I don't know what to do, and you're not here.
You need to be brave, and you need to behave like your brother.
Now this is what you're going to do. Listen carefully.
So where is Jennifer? Did she chicken out?
Stop that.
Not a single word.
Okay, Miss Confidence. You bet, you lost.
But, um, let's look on the bright side. We both look like twins. [chuckling]
-Listen… -Yeah?
Let's just eat and go. And no pictures.
-Really, Shanthi? -What?
No.
-What happened? -You can't…
-Wait… No! -[gasping]
-Listen to me. -You think Jodi cooked for us?
Shanthi…
-What's this here? -[chef] Guacamole.
-"Cockamole"? -No, "guacamole."
[Aya] Oh, "cockamole."
Hey, get out you, man.
You do takeaways?
Hey.
We promised Prishen, huh?
No, no, no, today we bring our A-game.
-[chuckles] Let the games begin. [chuckles]
Moothoo is a tough negotiator.
-I don't know what's gotten into him. -He took the money.
-How much? -Double what I thought.
-Shanthi, are you stupid? -What?
Would we be here all the way in Mauritius playing this laser tag of all things?
But it's fine. At least we're here. That's good.
Are you ready?
Yeah, let's do this thing.
-We gotta pick teams. I choose Shanthi. -Yeah.
That's not fair. She's like a human shield.
Fine. It's Preggie and I. A battle of the sexes.
Hey. Hey, what about me then?
You're useless on any team anyway.
Like you're useless in the kitchen, bedroom, everywhere.
-Ma! -What I said?
She can't clean kitchen, bedroom. Nothing she can do.
Just join the guys' team. You're gonna need the extra protection anyway.
[under breath] Witch.
What's our strategy, sir?
Calm down.
I'm taking the old lady. Human shield, my foot.
We just need to kill time. So make it long and painful.
Think of that damn Anjali.
Come on, Jen. Let's finish these ones off.
Ten-four that, sir!
Let's go.
Ma, you can't shoot us.
All's fair in love and war.
We're on the same team, Ma.
Own goal.
"Cockamole"!
What she said?
I think, uh, "holy moly."
What happened, eh? It's finished now.
[laughs] Sinked by the old bat, of all people.
Moothoo's just refusing any offer.
Keeps saying, "Madame, today is a day of leisure for your pleasure."
But I thought you got him where you want him.
I got Moothoo where I want him, brah.
Sure, bru, you just bought us three more hours.
Make that four.
-[Shanthi] Jen! Jennifer! -[Aya] "Cockamole."
[Shanthi] This one is here already?
Everybody, can I have your attention?
I just wanna say a few words because my heart is so full of joy today.
Jodi and Prishen, come and stand by me.
The birth of a baby is a new season and a new time.
Today I'm happy to announce I am the laser tag queen of Mauritius.
-[laughs] -I even have a certificate.
Take that, suckers.
[Prishen and Jodi laugh] Congratulations, Aya.
-You think that was the highlight? -Anjali.
What time did you get here?
She's a neighbor. She can go in and come anytime she pleases.
Oh. We were told 2:00 p.m.
I just popped in to share this app with Jodi. It works like a charm.
Apps are good, but nothing beats a mother's touch.
Exactly.
Besides, I've already drawn up a routine for my daughter.
So where's the mother's touch in a routine?
-I find it cold and calculated. -[Jennifer] Don't be stupid, Shanthi.
It's more like it's well-thought-out and organized.
-But nothing beats love and affection. -That is a given.
But if you want to raise a winner, it starts now. Every--
Just hold on a second. Hold on a second. Wait.
-Jodi, what do you think you're doing? -She's crying, Jen.
Studies have shown
that if you scurry around at every peep a baby makes,
then you just encourage the wrong behavior.
Just take your studies and shove it.
-[crying stops] -Look at that. You see? She stopped. What did I say?
[sighing] Jodi, we're to help.
I'm gonna take care of the baby, and Jennifer's gonna do the cooking.
Better we starve.
[Prishen] There'll be no cooking today. I've ordered.
A toast to the newest addition to our family. Yay.
Jodi and Prishen, you've given us the greatest gift.
We love you guys.
Oh, and she's absolutely beautiful.
Plus too we came way Mauritius.
Also, I want to say, two times I saw you.
I didn't wanna make a big thing about it,
but there and then, I knew you could do it.
The birth of our granddaughter is a start of a new legacy.
You all know we've worked really hard on our business.
-Business? Bru, it's an empire. -[all chuckle]
And we have decided to pass it on.
What you guys mean?
[Elvis] Jodi, it's all yours.
All yours. I mean, this is our family legacy, Jodi,
and we know that one day,
you will pass it on to our lovely granddaughter.
Hey, bru, you know how many times I nearly let the cat out of the bag?
Wait, did you know about this?
Uh, geez, Uncle Elvis, that's… that's a lot to take in. Thank you.
So everybody knew about this besides me? Thanks for nothing, Jen.
Prishen's right. There's a lot to unpack here.
Of course. Like, are you guys gonna move back to SA?
Is my son still gonna be a doctor? What about baby number two?
Wait. Let's ask Uncle Preggie to help with the decisions
since he knows everything!
[Jennifer] Look, Shanthi,
I think if we just give Jodi and Prishen some time,
then they'll just work it all out, right?
Babe, where have you been?
The next nappy change is on you, Miss CEO.
Please, you don't know how her. She'll never let me make any decisions.
Look, let's just serve dessert and get through another sleepless night.
-Come on. -Come on.
Bon appétit. Jodi made dessert.
-[Preggie] Wow! -[Jennifer] Oh!
That looks fantastic, Jod.
-[Preggie] Thank you. -Jodi!
You made that?
So, guys, have you thought of a name for the baby yet?
Elvis is named after Elvis Presley.
I was thinking of my favorite song, "Waltzing Matilda."
How's Matilda?
Don't ask me.
I'm sure these ones must've already chosen a name for the baby.
Elvis? Jennifer?
Preggie.
The planning committee.
Shanthi, come on.
I just wanted it to be a lovely surprise. That's all.
There's nothing lovely about keeping secrets from your friend
and your wife.
Hey, who made this tea? It's tops, huh?
It's really tasty.
That's because I made it.
Anyway, getting back to the naming ceremony.
We want something small and simple right here with just us.
So I like the names Vidya, Mahalakshmi…
No.
…and Divya.
Mm-mm.
I think we should go with something more modern and cute.
-Like Leia, or Lexi, or Lara. -No.
-Yeah? -No, no, no, no, no.
So what were the initials you got?
A.
-Uh, SA. -And MA.
[Aya] Wait.
MA. Matilda?
Aya, this tea is tops, huh? Mm.
-[Elvis] Yeah. -So nice and sweet.
Um, I think Mauritian sugar is sweeter than ours, huh?
Wait. Aya, which milk did you use?
A small cute container in the fridge with a pink lid.
-That's my breast milk. -[Prishen] Oh!
Good.
-Okay. -[Elvis grunts]
See here, son.
Now that you're a dad, you must know the do's and the don'ts.
-Yeah. -Wait. See here.
Because we've been to hell and back, boy. Yeah.
So listen to us like your future depends on this, huh?
Yeah. You see, now that the baby is here…
you gotta manage expectations.
You know what we mean by expectations?
Now if you get lucky twice a year, that's a top thing.
Yeah. And now you must start pretending that you're losing your hearing.
You must say it's genetic, and you must practice it.
What?
-[laughs] -Exactly.
Yeah. Because the baby's gonna cry and cry a lot.
So if you can't hear, she's going to get tired of complaining
and sort the baby out herself, you see?
-But, Uncle Elvis, I really want to help. -Hey, hey, hey. Shh.
Keep quiet and listen carefully.
Now, not only are you losing your hearing, you're also constipated.
Yeah, then if you go to the toilet, you can take as long as you want to.
That gives you a good time-out, boy.
And if you got any friends who are good at cooking, cleaning,
uh, feeding, looking after the children…
-Dump them. -Yeah. You know why?
Because if Jodi meets them, she's gonna compare you to them.
So you must have friends who are lazy, dirty.
So you become the benchmark, boy.
-So that's why you two are best friends? -[both] Hey.
Don't get clever, yeah. Just listen to us. That's all I'm saying. Tell him. Tell him.
Oh, thank God. I could do with some good news tonight.
You know, I just spoke to Desan, and he's so worried.
[woman] I don't think you understand, Shanthi.
Desan is the problem here, and the petition is to get him expelled.
Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean? [inhales sharply]
We didn't find out exactly what--
[woman] Shanthi, your child is making my child's life a misery.
I'm not interested in your stories. Just go to hell.
Preggs, I called her.
Hmm. What did she say?
So I sent her pics of Desan crying and his injuries.
So will she call the school?
Yeah, she's on board. She said she'll give the school a call today,
and she will give them our side of the story.
But this thing needs to get sorted, eh, Shanthi?
-True, huh? -We still don't know who's behind this.
[Jodi] So, there's gateaux piments. It's chili bhajias.
Mauritian cari, dhal puri, boulettes, which are dumplings,
and of course, bol renversé, an upside-down bowl stir-fry.
[all] Wow! [Prishen] My wife has been upping her game.
Jodi! Oh my goodness.
Jodi, sweetheart.
This looks amazing, Jods.
So, Jodi, where did you learn all this?
Classified info.
You're brilliant in the kitchen. Soon, the boardroom.
You're my superwoman.
Hello? Anybody seen the real Jennifer?
[Preggie] Well, what a feast.
-You're really killing it, Jodi. -Thank you.
[Elvis] I can't wait for you to be CEO, Jen Junior.
[Jennifer] Absolutely. We should drink to that.
Jodi, do you know how to make that, uh, "cockamole"?
Oh, she's finally asleep. [sighs]
-Finally. -[sighs]
Hey, proud husband moment today, Miss Master Chef.
Even your mom had nothing bad to say.
[Prishen] Hey, babe, the weather seems like it's clearing up.
Oh, today's gonna be such a good day. We're gonna have so much of fun,
and someone's in a good mood.
Hey.
[Preggie on phone] Hey, howzit, boy? Yeah, it's Daddy here.
[Preggie on phone] Hey, howzit, boy? Yeah, it's Daddy here. "Daddy"? Dad, what's going on? Are you guys on the road already?
"Daddy"? Dad, what's going on? Are you guys on the road already?
Hey, yeah, life can just change, yeah. Things are so unpredictable, man.
-Dad, are you okay? -Elvis, what you said?
Um, tell Prishen that Seven Sands seemed closer than we thought.
Seven Sands? Dad, I'm so confused.
Yeah, you know, we thought it'll be about 15, 20,
uh, but it's looking more like… [spluttering] …like seven, like seven.
Sands? Seven Sands?
[laughing] No, about five.
But there's no Five Sands.
Exactly, son. You know, just five.
F-I-V-E, five.
Oh! You guys are five minutes away?
Exactly, son. [laughing] Hey, that's why you're a doctor, eh?
Babe, you bring the bag. I got the basket. Let's go.
[both] Oh, shit!
-Hey, honey. Hey, baby. Hi. -Hi.
Sorry.
Uh, Moothoo, uh, what's that sound?
What sound, sir?
Elvis, you can hear it, eh?
-There, that sound. -Yeah, loud and clear. Loud and clear.
Hey, bro, that sounds like a gudgeon pin knock, man.
-Can you hear anything? -I can't hear anything.
There, there, there. I think just play safe, Moothoo. Pull over here. Uh, we'll check it out. Right here, right here.
Pull over here. Uh, we'll check it out. Right here, right here.
Prishen?
Jodi?
Jodi?
Prishen?
Prishen?
-[phone beeps] -[Shanthi] Where are you all?
Where are you all?
Oh, we just popped by.
Uh, I think I left my pressure tablets in your kitchen.
What a story they're cooking! [muffled] They're bluffing, Prishen! They're bluffing, Prishen!
[whispering] Shut up, Ma. Do you wanna get your false teeth sucked out again? Shh!
No problem. Anjali has a key.
Wait! Did you all take the baby out of the house?
[Prishen] Yeah, we had an appointment with the pediatrician.
-God! -What?
Bad winds and everything. Why are they like this?
[Prishen] Get the key from Anjali and make yourselves comfortable.
Okay, bye.
Boom. That's how it's done.
Jods, hello. Anyone home?
They gave you the duck.
Just keep quiet, Ma.
Shanthi, listen, I'm thinking this could work in our favor with Anjali.
Yeah, nice to get to know her.
-I will happily skip the gardens. -Yeah.
Me too. Gardens you see everywhere--
No. You don't make your own stories. You're going with Elvis and Preggie.
-Elvis and Preggie? -Exactly.
So boring.
And your friend, Moothoo.
-Oh. Now you put it like that… -Yeah.
We need to suss her out, Jen. Because we're gonna be gone in a few days.
Yeah, but Anjali is here to stay.
I'm just trying to think ahead, Shanthi.
-Jodi has a massive task ahead of her. -True.
I mean, some women are very happy to just stay at home.
And there's nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that at all.
Don't beat around the bush. Just say what you wanna say, man.
It's just some women are cut differently. That's all I'm saying, Shanthi.
And I'm saying that some women need to be cut down to size.
That's all I'm saying.
[Jennifer] Wow!
Well, it's quite a pleasant surprise to have you both here.
Well, I must say you have the most beautiful home, Anjali.
And… and you look gorgeous by the way.
Oh, thanks, Aunty Jen.
You guys are missing the gardens.
Yeah, that's my fault. I had such a splitting headache.
Oh, she had a horrible headache,
and obviously, I decided to stay and take care of Shanthi.
[Shanthi] Yeah, she did.
But everybody else is enjoying themselves, I'm sure.
-Mmm. -Especially Aya.
-Oh, she loves it. Loves it. -[upbeat music playing]
-[exclaiming] -Moothoo, don't be scared. I got this.
-It's fine. Come on, Moothoo. -No, Aya!
Don't be scared. I got this.
-Moothoo. -[gasping]
-I got this. -Okay.
Ma, I see you and Moothoo are getting on very well.
-He likes spending time with you. -What's happening exactly, Aya?
-Why? You think he's got an eye on me? -[laughs] No, we're not saying that, Ma.
Who can blame him? I'm irresistible like that.
Ma, what we're saying is that you can't trust anyone so easily.
Hey, I'm not born yesterday.
Aya, you didn't give him any money?
Relax.
[in Mauritian Creole] Everything is good.
[in English] You okay there, Moothoo?
Anjali, I absolutely cannot get over the design of this house.
Actually, it's all my husband. He was an architect.
"Was"?
Well, he passed away last year.
-Oh! Sorry. -We're so sorry to hear that, Anjali.
It can't be easy maintaining this house without him.
It's getting quite tough.
I'm already looking to some new business ideas.
Sorry. I didn't hear her.
-Yes! -Yes! Well done.
Thanks so much, Anjali. I hope this wasn't too much of an inconvenience.
Are you kidding me? Your moms are awesome.
-Anjali, you are such a hoot. -Thank you.
[Jennifer] Oh, by the way, all the best with that business venture.
-I know you're gonna be awesome. -Thank you.
[Jennifer] You got this, eh.
-Brilliant. -Take care. Bye.
Shanthi, like one miracle, you got better so quickly.
Hey, Jods, this is for you.
You should try and get a smoothie in every day
to help you get back in shape.
Says the person with no shape.
You'll starve, Jodi. That smoothie won't even say hello.
Come on, every little bit helps.
And you should also aim to get into a little exercise routine. Hmm?
You need to rest and restore.
[whispering] And maybe tie the stomach.
Hm-mm. Jodi needs to focus on her career.
Hmm. The Kandasamy legacy, the big secret.
[Jennifer sighs] We all just want what's best for our kids.
So then why was I the only one left in the dark, Jen?
Prishen, was there talk of a hurricane?
Um, Mom, Aunty Jen, I need some advice.
I've been off the rails with my exercise and diet. I'm struggling to balance.
Jodi, this boy is juggling so many things. You must be more supportive, man.
Exactly, sweetie. I mean, pregnancy is not a sickness.
What have you been doing?
You don't really want your husband to end up looking like a lump of lard.
What is this?
I was thinking it'll be nice to give her a nice leg bath.
-No. -Shanthi, you're gonna fit on that thing?
Rather I give the bath.
[Shanthi] So tell me, what do you think about Anjali?
I… I was so surprised. I felt actually drawn to her.
You know, she reminded me so much of myself. Like a mini-me.
Oh no! Two of you.
Oh, wow!
Uh… Um, excuse me. Are you sure it's one-size-fits-all?
[shopkeeper] Yes.
It's stretchy fabric, okay?
Oh, Shanthi, stretch only goes so far.
Body shaming. Pathetic, man!
Anyway, I'll take two of these. Thanks.
Indian gold?
Not looking too yellow.
Top-notch gold. It's a bargain.
Only a bargain if it's free.
[Jennifer and Shanthi in Tamil] Greetings, Guru!
Greetings.
[in English] Anjali spoke so highly of you. Thank you. How is the baby?
Thank you. How is the baby?
-She's the image of my son. -My beautiful daughter.
Oh, Guru, this temple is too stunning.
Yes.
It is. Isn't it?
[Jodi] How could our moms plan the naming ceremony without asking us?
-[baby crying] -Who gave them permission? Huh?
It's her. It's her. She just… She just takes over.
I didn't even get to choose the outfit.
I mean, how am I supposed to get that on a screaming baby? -[crying stops] -[shushing]
I don't know, hon.
-[sighs] -But…
let's get it together.
For her, for our daughter.
-Okay? Together? -[sighs heavily]
Oh! Oh, no, no, no, no.
[mouthing] Love you.
-[laughing] -Thanks.
[laughing] It's fine.
I think we did good today.
See what happens when we all work together without any secrets?
[chuckles] Proud parent moments for us today.
You know, I think we couldn't have asked for better kids.
I could have asked for a better daughter-in-law.
And Jodi and Prishen, they're really shining at this, eh.
You know, I got some really good vibes from Jodi today, Elvis.
It was so nice to see her show up like that,
you know, like the woman we brought her up to be.
It'd be nicer if you told her, not us. It builds them up.
I agree.
No harm in praising our kids.
Serious harm in over-praising if you ask me.
As usual, no one asked you.
[Jennifer] Moothoo, is this the way back to Jodi's place?
[Elvis] I'm sure the driver knows which way to take.
[Aya] Preggie, take one selfie of me and the coconut.
Moothoo?
[Preggie] Aya, hit one pose and say "coconut."
Moothoo.
I thought we had an understanding.
Madame, you're not understanding that it was a misunderstanding.
No, no, no, no, no. There was no misunderstanding.
I pay you, and you need to do as I say. It's as simple as that.
It's not that simple.
Okay, I see what is going on here.
I will pay you a higher price,
and I will put it in the envelope, put my name on it--
No, no, no. No price. No more. [in Mauritian Creole] Everything is good?
[in English] No. No, no, no. No drese patout.
No everything is good, because everything is bad, very bad.
We had a deal, Moothoo. You can't back out of that now.
Excusez-moi.
Why do you say I'm throwing money away, Jen?
Oh, please, Elvis, I don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure that out.
-[Elvis sighs] -Why are y'all screaming?
Go on, deny it. Deny it. What did you pay him the money for?
-It was a tip. -Bullshit!
Look, Preggie, Prishen, they said that--
[Jennifer] Elvis!
Fine. Okay, fine.
Prishen came to us for some help.
So you and Preggie are now psychologists all of a sudden.
Only one psycho here, and we all know who that is.
Look, if you give me a chance, I can explain--
Explain what, Elvis? How stupid you and Peggie are?
What are you all arguing about?
Ma, your highly educated son gave Moothoo dollars, Ma.
That Moothoo is a conman, and you'd better watch your back as well.
I'm watching my back from the time my son got married.
Ma, this is not a joke, okay?
I'm also worried that he could be taking you for a ride.
He's a driver. That's his job, to take people for a ride.
[tuts] Just don't give him any money.
Jen… [sighs]
[in Mauritian Creole] Everything is good, eh?
[in English] It was a mistake. I don't know how she found out.
I could smack you, huh?
We should both klap you. You know how much of trouble we're in?
-Mr. Preggie, you never gave me money. -Good!
You didn't take me to the Seven Sands, bloody idiot.
I have your Seven Sands.
Elvis, this guy got attitude.
Hey, just hold me back, Preggie!
-Hold me back! -Hold him back!
Aunty Jen, Aunty Shanthi, you were saying?
Well, I'm saying, Anj, that I'm so impressed by your drive and your discipline.
And we think you are lovely, and so…
So, I want to invest in your idea.
Très bien. Sounds good.
And the second part is…
And it's no secret.
We think that you'd make the perfect nanny for our baby.
[Shanthi] So nice we got this photo shoot.
Hey, Shants, we need to talk, eh?
Hey, lucky I waxed my legs, huh?
-Shoot. -It's about Desan.
Jen?
Jen?
-Jennifer? -[Jennifer] Ma?
[Aya] Come here.
Ma.
How long you're taking? What, I must drown, yeah?
[signs disgustedly] If only. Cut out the drama. What do you want?
Pass me my towel.
You called me for that?
While you're there, pass me my, um, this thing.
Your what?
My unmentionables.
Your underwear? You forgot your underwear?
You don't have to spell it out like that.
Why you think they call it unmentionables?
While you're there, just bring my spencer also. Onetime.
Ma, how devious can you be?
How can you lie to your own son?
[Aya] Pot calling the kettle black.
I'm gonna tell Elvis you gave Moothoo money.
Don't you dare. I'm gonna tell Elvis you conspired with Moothoo.
Who do you think he's gonna believe? Me or you?
Now, don't go touching other people's things. Hmm?
The email from the school was clear. Desan is suspended.
But I thought everything was sorted out.
Well, one child finally came forward with what actually happened.
-I saw the video. -And?
It's bad.
Let me see.
Hey, where are you going? You're staying with me, okay?
[chuckles] Yeah, you're staying with me. You're not going anywhere, okay.
-Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Watch it. -[boy on video] Desan, stop it!
-Desan! -You shut up, okay? This is my territory.
Come here. You're not going anywhere, huh?
[Aya] What we gotta do?
Nothing, Ma. It's a photo shoot. They'll give you some props and all that.
Just go have some fun.
I'm not in a fun mood.
Welcome to Jennifer's world.
A world filled with crooks and robbers.
If the cap fits, wear it.
Guys, remember when Jodi cooked for us?
[Elvis] Who can forget? That was a top chow there, that.
At my age, food is like medicine. Goes in, comes out.
Did she make dhal puri?
[Elvis] Yeah, and dumplings and a stir-fry.
She's done really well, hasn't she, our Jodi?
What are you doing, Ma? Looks like you're having a stroke or something. [chuckles]
-I'm practicing smiling for the photos. -Oh.
[tuts] You do know how all the youngsters do.
Babe, should we carry some jackets? The weather looks like it's changing.
-Prish… -And I need more nappies.
-Prishen. -Hmm?
I'm feeling out of sorts.
Come on, I'm right here.
I don't know if I wanna be a mom anymore.
Babe, What you're feeling is all Jennifer and Shanthi--
It's not them.
-Of course, it's them. -Look at me. [sobs]
It's me.
[sobbing] I don't wanna be with her.
My own baby.
How long have you felt this way?
What's happening to me, Prishen?
[Prishen] Ready? Watch this.
-[Prishen] Oh. -[Jodie laughs] And that's what happens when you try to juggle, Prishen.
Excuse me?
[Jennifer] And, Jodi, you're at the start of your balancing act.
[Prishen] Life's too short to be a balancing act.
Uh, sorry. Hold on. I was talking to Jodi, my daughter.
Who happens to be my wife.
I don't think she meant it like--
What I meant is that sometimes things are not as they seem.
What are you talking about now?
I'm talking about Jodi's act the other day,
when she "cooked" for lunch.
You didn't know, Prishen?
Aw, shame! I thought the two of you were a team. Hey?
Aunty Jennifer, I'm asking you very politely to back off!
Prishen, what's wrong with you?
Come on, Jodi, speak. Why're you so quiet?
Some people like to be quiet. Not everybody got a big mouth like you.
Admit it. Tell Prishen how you lied to him about cooking lunch,
how your neighbor Anjali did it,
how you listened to all our compliments and said absolutely nothing--
Aunty Jennifer, if you don't shut up--
You watch your mouth when you're talking to me, you little nipper. Who the hell do you think you are,
you little nipper. Who the hell do you think you are,
giving us scheduled times to see our grandchild, hmm?
And sending us to stay far away. Sis, Prishen.
But it's obvious, Shanthi, that's what they would do
because they didn't want us to see their inadequacies.
What inadequacies, Ma?
-[Prishen] She's not worth it. -[Jennifer] Who's she?
-[Prishen] She's not worth it. -[Jennifer] Who's she? 'Cause that's what we mean to them, outsiders.
After everything we did for you, you ungrateful little shit.
Like making huge life decisions for us.
He's right, Jennifer. He's right.
You can't expect my child to leave everything and run your business.
[Jennifer] What are you on about?
We are giving them a golden future on a platter.
Yeah, but it's always about your legacy, your child. Isn't? You're also so selfish--
Oh, please, Ma. You're no better with Desan.
What are you talking about, Prishen?
No one can ever say that I don't love my children.
Then why is he still using that small, pokey little room, huh?
Your mother's going through a lot. Just relax. No, Dad. No. These two went behind our backs
No, Dad. No. These two went behind our backs
and offered Anjali a job to look after our baby--
"Our baby. Our this, our that."
Why don't you stop whining and just grow up?
[Shanthi] Prishen?
You just don't get it, do you?
I was just trying to help her.
Help her? She's fine compared to you when you were a new mother.
Because I couldn't cope, Ma. I couldn't manage.
You were a useless mother.
-Yeah. -[Aya] You and I both knew it.
Yeah, I was useless.
[shakily] You knew it. I knew it. Everybody knew it.
You made sure of that, didn't you?
[voice breaking] I was a new mother.
I was overwhelmed, and confused, and scared.
I was falling apart. I needed you, Ma.
You saw me struggling.
Why didn't you help me?
[sniffles] Why didn't you help me?
What did you do?
You went to Elvis, and you told him I was weak and needy.
I was drowning, Ma. I was drowning.
You made me feel like something was wrong with me.
How could you do that?
No woman should ever go through that.
Ever.
[crying] I just wanted to make it easier for my child.
I just wanted to make it easier for my child.
[Desan on video] You shut up, okay? This is my territory. Come here. Come here.
Anjali?
[Anjali] Aunty Jen, I needed to tell you something.
It's not a good time.
[Anjali] Jodi wanted to do something special for you, her family.
What are you talking about?
[Anjali] The cooking, Aunty Jen. I didn't do it. I taught Jodi.
She made me teach her weeks ago. But on that day, it was all her.
[Aya] There are moments in life
when we suddenly realize the impact of our action on others…
Do I really love Prishen more?
[Aya] …moments when we take time out to accept and to heal.
But before we heal, we hurt.
We hurt very badly.
But it's not always easy to forgive, is it?
Nor is it easy to ask for forgiveness.
Remember when we started the business
out of our own garage?
Yeah. Working 18 hours a day non-stop.
Using every last cent of our savings.
[chuckles] Borrowing from Peter to pay Paul.
You heading some branches, me the others.
We really did build something, didn't we, Elvis?
It was you, Jen,
working tirelessly in the office.
I was just so happy to build a family legacy.
No. No.
It was us.
It was us.
Building the Kandasamy family business.
All so we could pass it on to our daughter.
That's all I ever wanted.
-I messed up. -[sighs]
I don't know how to fix it.
[Preggie] Shanthi.
Desan won a competition.
-What competition? -A poetry slam.
I sent it to everyone. Watch with me.
When I look in the mirror Do you know what I see?
Just a stupid fool looking back at me
Can never get things right No matter how much I try
Desan, why you can't be like Prishen? He's the perfect guy
Mom sees him as a hero
Me, I'm just a second child, a zero
Secondhand toys, secondhand clothing Maybe it's secondhand love I'm receiving
"Desan, you're stupid. You didn't even know which side to go."
"If Prishen was here, he would have covered the whole goalpost."
When my parents look at me Do you know what they see?
The black sheep of the family
Walk around with a smile But inside I'm raging
What's the use of talking When nobody is listening?
I love my mom She means the world to me
I just want her to be proud of me
I'm losing myself, I need some help
'Cause I'm going down, down, down, down Down, down, down, down
Can you hear me? Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Anybody listening?
Down, down, down, down Down, down, down, down, down
Is anybody listening?
Oh, my babies!
Oh, come, my darling.
Oh, my baby. Come, come, come. Come through.
[sighs] When I called, I was just hoping you'd come.
-[Prishen] We can't say no to you, Aya. -[Aya] Aw! It's lovely out here.
Oh my! I got something for her.
[Aya] You guys are packing already?
[sighs] I can't believe we're leaving under these circumstances.
[Elvis] This is supposed to be the happiest time for us.
You know, we never even asked Jodi what she wanted.
Yeah, yeah, we didn't.
And… and that's all on me
because of my domineering and always-in-control self.
That's what it is.
[Elvis] Come on, Jen.
You know, when I really think about it… [inhales]
…Jodi's actually been taking care of me all these years.
I mean, you know what a workaholic I've been, Elvis.
And Jodi's just been there from the time she was a little girl.
Bringing me tea, making me sandwiches,
mothering me.
She's gonna make a great mom.
[Elvis] Of course, she will.
[Jennifer] Yeah, I wish I could have told her how proud I am of her.
Come.
[Elvis] We've always wanted what's best for you.
But we've also realized that only you know what's best for you.
We're thinking of selling the business.
And if you're okay with it, we'll just go ahead.
But if you choose to,
it's yours.
[shakily] Completely yours, darling. No interferences at all.
But it's your everything.
No, it's not.
[tearfully] You are our everything.
[mouthing] Thank you.
[Prishen] Hey!
-You guys organized a braai for us. -[Aya] My darling!
You know how our Jodi loved this when she was younger.
-Hey, sweetie. -Thanks, Ma.
Aw, look at our little baby.
-[Prishen] It smells like home. -Hey, boy.
There you go.
Jodi, you're doing an amazing job.
-Every woman knows how tough it is. -True.
Whilst everyone is confessing--
Hey, Aya, we all know you're the laser tag queen.
Anyway, that too.
I was a little bit naughty.
I cooked up a scheme with Moothoo and made a big profit from all of you all.
From all of us?
Yes, you, Prishen, Jennifer, Shanthi, everyone.
-Onetime. -[all laugh]
Aya, how much of money did that fellow give you?
I was the brains in the operation.
-His cut was 20%. -[upbeat Indian percussion music playing]
Aya, 80%? You took 80%, and you gave him 20?
Go big, or go home. [in Mauritian Creole] Everything is good.
Allez! Allez!
-[Prishen] Oui! Oui! -[all laughing]
[in English] Wait, Ma. What did you need the money for?
I wanted to buy a gold bangle for my great-granddaughter.
You know it's customary for us to buy.
There you go, Ma. There you go.
She's getting as strong…
-[Shanthi] Which way are you holding it? -[Prishen] Turn it for a selfie.
-Look. -Look there.
Watch her face.
-Are you ready? -Yeah.
Everybody say "Arya!"
-[all] Arya! -[shutter clicks]
[Shanthi] I'm so sorry for everything.
[Desan] I love you, Ma.
But only after a month.
You are grounded.
-No more bullying. -Bullying.
-No more… -Bullying.
-I'm sorry, Ma. No more bullying. -[Preggie] Hmm.
[Aya] Ah! That's parenting for you.
You have to take it all, the good, the bad, the ugly.
Nice to say.
All in all, it's the most beautiful, precious gift.
[Preggie] Son.
Say "thatha."
Sound check, one, two.
Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats
and welcome to my niece's first birthday party.
Wow! What a year it's been!
Becoming a parent is a beautiful thing.
We often wonder how our parents did it.
-I, too, wonder how your parents did it. -[guests laugh]
They somehow managed and made all the sacrifices for us.
And sometimes we forget, or we don't acknowledge it enough,
but we know that there's no such thing as a perfect parent.
But every now and then…
-Our parents come pretty close. -They do.
[laughing] Lies!
-[Aya] Ah, parenting! -[guests cheering]
[Aya] It fills your heart with love and joy.
-Let's go. -[Aya] But why I must lie?
Nothing can prepare you for it.
[Aya] There is no rule book,
no perfect recipe.
That's the problem.
But just follow your instincts and pray for the best.
Grandmas of the year!
-Best party ever. -Absolutely.
Elvis, Preggie, show them what I taught you all.
Wake up!
Elvis.
[Aya] Sometimes, there'll be good days and bad days.
Some days, we'll have no idea what to do.
Sometimes, they'll give you sleepless nights and heartaches.
Some days, they'll love you,
and other days, they'll hate you.
But that's okay.
Just keep doing your best.
That's a top parent for you.
My happiest moment was when I was waving goodbye to them
at the airport.
Except Aya.
It's funny how she thinks she's still the mastermind.
I was the only one seeing the envelopes before everybody.
So I was choosing to give her her "80%."
But shh. Don't tell anybody.
[in Mauritian Creole] Everything is good.
[in English] What happens after this?
Who knows?
Who knows if the kids will come back to Durban?
Who knows if they'll have another baby?
Who knows if some people will still be around?
What goes around comes around.
Because karma is a…
whose debut album sold over ten million copies worldwide.
Someone who's sold over a million concert tickets
and gone from pubs to clubs to arenas
and enormous festival crowds in just a few years.
And he's done so while remaining resolutely himself.
So please welcome to the stage, Lewis Capaldi.
I think I've never been more insecure in my life than I am now.
The success of the first one made me feel more insecure
and sort of self-conscious about my own abilities.
[Matt] Do you spend a lot of time thinking about that?
[Lewis] Oh, yeah, big time. I'm thinking about it now.
[Ryan] You're really anxious. I find it difficult to watch you.
[Lewis] It's one of these things.
-[Ryan] But it's not. -It is.
-What can I do? -Yeah.
But you're in pain because of that.
[Lewis] I feel like I'm in a race against the clock
to get my mental health in order.
What's the date today, what's the date?
The 26th, Thursday, 26th December, 2018.
The day I became a celeb.
That famous that I've now got my own private shitter.
That I let other people use.
Hello, ladies!
This here says, "He looks so fucking cool."
I guess so, mate. Thank you.
I guess fucking so.
From here on, I will climb through the celeb hierarchy.
I'll start, naturally, on the C-list.
I hope you're enjoying yourselves. Very nice to be here.
Sure enough, I'll climb up through the Bs…
-I don't know who Lewis Capaldi is. -Hope he's watching.
I feel like I fucking know you. I've seen your face everywhere.
[Lewis] …then through the As…
No hiding place now.
I'm a fucking celeb.
[Lewis] Number one in fucking America.
Get in!
And now making his US television debut…
-The fabulous… -…Lewis Capaldi!
What a superstar!
Clubs. Yes, guys.
Parties.
I shall wear the finest garments.
Fits perfect, like a glove.
I will dine in the finest restaurants, in the finest cities.
And when all is said and done, I shall lay at the bottom of a pit…
-[screaming] -…a shadow of the man I once was.
But I will rise. I will rise.
[woman] Is it worth it? Making you feel like this?
[Lewis] There's nothing further from the Grammys than Whitburn.
Small towns, loads of pubs.
That's it.
I always saw myself as someone
who would not live in their hometown and stuff.
But that's not fuckin' such a bad thing.
It's just like the antithesis of, like, all the fucking mad shit.
Ordinary is such a remarkable thing. Do you know what I mean?
There's something to be said for that… beauty
in, like, an everyday life.
I do love the fact that I am a Scottish person.
And I like the patter that people have.
-[chip shop assistant] That's you. -Cheers, cheers.
[Lewis] I do like the mindset of, like, realists.
[bartender] Look at that.
[Lewis] Everyone just stays on that level of,
"Let's give this a go and we'll probably fuck it up,
but we'll have a good time."
Do you know what I mean?
I've kind of learned how much that I actually do love where I'm from.
I feel like I'm home, and everything's just the same as always.
That's quite a nice feeling.
I mean, obviously, I've kind of picked the wrong career now if I wanted that.
Anonymity is not, um, something that I'm as familiar with.
There's that woman in the optician's pointing.
Weird she can see us from that distance despite being in an optician's.
You don't need to be there.
You're cured. [chuckles]
That's the test, look out of the window,
if you manage to spot Lewis Capaldi, your glasses are working.
Thank you.
There you go. See.
Hello.
[Mark] This ain't The Osbournes.
God's sake!
-[Lewis] Hello? -[Greg] Who goes there?
It's I, Lewis Capaldi, the ugly bastard.
-[Greg] What's happening? -[Lewis] Fuck all, Greg.
[Greg] Okay. Wanted to let you know where we are with the US Airplay campaign
that you have been working so hard on.
So, "Before You Go," right now, it's firmly in the number one position.
It's the longest journey to number one
in the history of the Billboard Airplay Chart.
Fucking hell.
And the Mediabase Airplay Chart as well.
Thank you so much, Greg.
And Lewis, stop bringing us fucking slow, sad songs.
It's too fucking hard.
I'll speed it up for the next album, honestly.
See ya, Greg. Thank you so much, mate.
-All right, bye. -Right. Bye-bye.
There you go. Fucking hell.
-[captivating music playing] -[crowd cheering]
[Lewis] A global pandemic is only in the top three weird things
that have happened to me in the last three years.
Thank you so much for everything you've done for me
over the last wee while.
My life has been fucking incredible, so thank you so much
My life has been fucking incredible, so thank you so much for everything you've done.
Look at how far they go.
I hadn't been away from home.
The first time I went to America
was because my music had taken us there.
In the last two years, people have become really nice to me.
But it's just coincidental.
[woman] Running a disco next door.
[man] Let's do it!
[Lewis] Making the first album, touring the album, recording it…
Just don't get the cock in.
I think it was as close to dreams coming true
as you could possibly get.
But as soon as your first album does well,
it's like, "Can he do it again, though?"
So there's that tension all the time.
You can only be the next big thing for, like, a year.
The clock's ticking.
You get your whole life to write your first album
and then a year or six months or something to write your second.
I'm in my parents' shed.
This is where I've been doing most of the second album from.
This is not how I expected to be doing a second album. Do you know what I mean?
If we're in doing a bit of recording, everything's fine,
and I just go, "Right, this isn't going very well."
"I'm off for a wank."
[chuckling] You know? It's like…
It seems like a very…
It's just a much, much simpler thing.
Maybe not a wank, I do live with my parents.
But that's a dangerous situation to be… to be masturbating in.
[Carol] You empty the dishwasher. On you go.
-[Lewis] I did it the other day. -[Carol] You did.
-You don't volunteer. -I did it, I volunteered to do it.
I did it out of my own accord.
You do that in here.
[Carol] It just all seems very bizarre.
It's as if you're watching a movie or something.
It's very, very strange.
He still wanders about in his pants and he comes up,
"I've not got any clean underwear, you need to give me some."
-You do that a lot. -Come on.
Everybody's gotta eat that
and you're sticking your manky fork in it.
Sometimes you think he's very adult, and then other times you think,
"You've still got a lot of growing up to do."
How you need to phone your mother
to come and pick you up from your one-night stand?
-That's not a story that needs to be told. -[laughs]
I'm glad you brought that up.
[Mark] Wee Luigi, he's got a heart of gold.
He's what you see, he's just a nice kid.
There's no airs and graces about him.
Why are you pretending that you cook?
-I do this all the time. -Does he, Mum?
-Of course I do. -[Carol] No.
I don't want this to change him. I think that would be really bad.
It wouldn't be worth it,
if he becomes a different person from the person he is just now.
[Mark] Frank's a bit sad, is he not?
-I can't believe you're taking him. -[Lewis] Mum wants me to.
-[Mark] No. -[Lewis] She does.
-"Get that cunt out of this house." -That's me she's talking about.
No, she says, "little prick," when she's talking about you.
So you do get it from me then?
[Lewis] A friend of mine who's a musician told me that fame doesn't change you,
it changes everyone around you.
Dad brings my name up every time he's on the phone,
and it's like, "My son has lots of Instagram followers."
[Mark] "Do you know who I am?"
I just use that as a superpower, to get what I want.
-You bring it up a lot with people. -[Mark] But not as much as I used to.
[chuckles] I've kind of mellowed.
-I'm getting used to it now. -[Lewis] He's bad for it.
And a bit… And like,
didn't he get a discount off that hot tub?
No, I would've got a discount off the hot tub if you'd sat next to it.
Not only would I have got a discount, I'd have got a sauna, free.
But would you sit next to it?
And the hot tub was actually called "Lewis."
[Lewis] There you go, so…
And all I wanted you to do is plant a cheek next to the hot tub.
No, he wouldn't do it.
[Lewis] There you go.
This haircut as well, mullet.
That's come back in a big way.
[Mark] That's a belter.
Oh, fucking hell.
-That's an absolute belter. -[Lewis] Jesus.
[Carol] These are all brand-new baby ones, look.
[Lewis] I can't see them.
I was born in Rottenrow Hospital, Glasgow,
on 7th October, 1996.
Twenty-five years ago it is, this year.
By all accounts, easy business.
Straight out, no bother.
I asked my mum.
She had had three kids before.
Oh, fuck, yeah. My dad was supposed to get a vasectomy.
The snip.
For those who don't know,
a vasectomy is when you get your tubes cut.
Can you still cum?
Mum was like, "No need for a vasectomy, I'm pregnant."
Me.
I got a new CD player!
[Mark] Three was a bit odd.
And Lewis came along.
Yeah. Completed the family.
Oh my God.
-What's that, Lewis? -What is it?
-You got a new guitar. -[Lewis] My oldest brother, Warren.
[Warren] We are going to rock!
[Lewis] He was the person that kind of got me into playing music.
He wanted to play guitar, I wanted to play guitar.
[Mark] You can use that with your new tuner?
[Mark] Lewis would always go in his room,
sit for hours practicing and then come down.
We'd all be excited, go in the kitchen, he'd say, "I've learned this."
♪ I was perched outside In the pouring rain ♪
[Carol] We'd all have to tiptoe when he's singing.
You can probably hear us all in the background
as we're bumping past him a lot of the time.
My name is Lewis Capaldi.
When I was younger, that was your first audience, parents.
I've got loads of fond memories,
like playing them songs when I just was doing it on guitar.
And now obviously when I have songs that I've finished,
I fire them off to them on WhatsApp, or…
Yeah, it's still something I do to this day.
[DJ over radio] Hello. It is The Gap Unplugged.
-Lewis, how are you doing? -[Lewis] I'm all right.
[DJ] The youngest person we have ever had on The Gap.
-What age are you? -[Lewis] 12.
[DJ] How long have you been playing guitar?
[Lewis] Since nine.
[DJ] When do you think you'll be ready to start gigging across Scotland?
[Lewis] Uh… whenever.
Not in the scene much.
I was just the driver, happy to go along for the ride.
[Lewis] My dad used to take me to all these fucking gigs.
Drive me to Glasgow, Edinburgh.
[Mark] Jab doors.
"My kid's a singer," people going, "Fuck, aye," all that kind of stuff.
I think he was 12 or 13. We lied about his age obviously.
[Lewis] Next week we're playing at The Garage Attic in Glasgow.
I would rock up. Literally, the person would go… [feedback rings]
Two speakers on the big stands.
A tiny, wee mixing board.
I would sound fucking shite.
I go… [low-pitched] "Hi, I'm Lewis Capaldi,"
'cause that's how it sounded through that speaker.
"I'm Lewis Capaldi and this song is," whatever the song was.
The place is fucking, like, everyone's talking to each other.
No one's listening to you. No one's turned round and looked at you.
We might have two people.
I would just do that for years and years.
And play these fucking shite pubs where no one gave a fuck.
Ten past seven at the minute, p.m., where I am in Scotland.
And, uh, I'm going to do a session, it's going to be lovely.
How I write, is I basically sit here… …at a piano…
At a piano and then bust through a bunch of ideas,
put them all on my iPad here.
Then I just kind of bank them all and blast through them.
And when it comes to doing a session, I pick what ones I'm taking out.
So, like, if you see, I just label it "cool,"
because, uh, that's obviously what my music is.
Do you know, in documentaries where people go,
"I've got a song." and they play a scratchy version of it
and then you cut forward like a year?
And I'm like, "Mm, I hope it does well."
Then it just, you know, in documentaries where it skips forward
and the crowd's going mental,
and they're all singing the song and it's a hit.
It'd be good if one of those, um, did that.
If that has happened with any of these songs,
we'll skip forward to that now in three, two, one…
Still here.
It happened for none of them then. Thank you.
[Nick] Nice to hear you back on the guitar.
-Welcome home. -Thanks, brother.
-You always come back. -Nice to have you back.
I swear, yeah.
Second number one record in America?
-Yeah. -Yeah, that's great.
That's about you, you're bona fide now.
-You got an idea or something? -I've got a couple, yeah.
So it was, er…
-This one. -[Nick] I'm not picking out some words.
Oh, yeah, I mean, I'm just kind of like, yeah… Moaning.
I like that, I do like that, that kind of verse, bit of like…
♪ Can't even begin to explain ♪
♪ This all-too-well familiar pain… ♪
-It's good, interesting place to start. -Yeah.
♪ It comes and it goes ♪
♪ And it leaves me alone in the end ♪
Um… And I did have another bit there.
[Nick] I love that, "This all-too-familiar pain," that's cool.
-This flow is nice. -Yeah.
♪ 'Cause it's only the beat of my heart ♪
♪ All this way till the end to my start ♪
♪ If you wait till the end If you tell me, tell me ♪
♪ Tell me you'll leave me again ♪
-Good? Yeah. -Whoo! Yeah.
Yeah, it's cool.
[hums] ♪ More to give ♪ [Nick] ♪ …more to give ♪
Yeah.
♪ I have nothing left to lose ♪
Fuck.
♪ 'Cause if I do it all just to keep it… ♪
[Lewis] If the words in a song make me feel anything,
it's probably a good thread to follow,
whether it's a happy song or a sad song or whatever.
If it evokes enough of an emotion that it stirs up something in me,
that's the thing to follow.
♪ And nothing more I could give ♪
♪ Went down with this sinking ship now ♪
♪ Don't think I'll make it through ♪
Cool.
Fuck off, it's hard to get that on fucking key.
I wasn't a fucking poet. I didn't have a journal.
I still don't have a journal. I don't read.
It's not cool not to read, I wish I did,
but I don't have the attention span.
I have the attention span to play songs on stage for people.
There's no better feeling than having that rush, do you know what I mean?
♪ Through… ♪
[Nick] What?
-♪ Fuck you ♪ -[Lewis laughing]
[Lewis] The reason I started writing music was so I could play it live.
With the last album,
the first thing we brought out was the song called "Bruises."
We didn't really think it was that big of a song.
King Tut's in January, 2017.
I had to perform, like, a bunch of new songs,
"Bruises" was that song.
♪ I've been told, I've been told To get you off my mind ♪ ♪ But I hope I never lose the bruises That you left behind ♪
And then it kind of went viral.
And you see the smile on his face when the crowd sang back.
We knew that's what he was gonna do for the rest of his life.
So you must have heard it before.
Spotify picked it up and put it at number one on New Music Friday in America
and yeah, it just flew.
This is the Radio 1 playlist for next week.
That's my fucking name right there.
Paddy.
Fucking hell. [chuckles]
This is my bedroom. I just love the big city.
"Completely hypnotized."
"What a beautiful voice and what a handsome boy."
Fucking yes!
"Distinctive features." Maybe my eyes…
I got chubby fucking cheeks.
[DJ on radio] When people meet you,
are they more interested in your music or your Instagram?
[Lewis] People come up to me in the street like,
"I love your Instagram, man," and I'm like, "I'm a singer, too."
I didn't really know what I was getting into
when I was posting those videos.
That's me having a poo.
So I went out last night, just having a dance and stuff.
People started getting their phones out.
Why are they all so interested in what we're doing?
And then I remembered it's 'cause I'm fucking famous.
[Lewis] Let's go.
[Lewis] The friends I hang out with now are friends that I had in school.
Michael is a gravedigger.
Conor is a roofer-turned-DJ,
and Niall is a student recruitment officer.
Dec Duff works with welding things, an engineer of some form.
I don't know what an engineer does, so… that's why I said welding.
Aiden Halliday plays piano for me and is a musical director.
Aidan Beattie plays bass in my band.
So, two of them are… hitched to my wagon.
[man] Can I see that watch?
[Lewis] If you talk about being grounded and stuff,
trying to keep your feet on the ground
when you don't know where the fucking ground is for a lot of the time.
But your relationship with your friends is the main thing.
Really good for making sure you're not a cunt.
I've definitely noticed you've realized you can pay someone for anything.
-[Niall] That's not a bad thing. -[man] It's free drink.
[Conor] Aye, free drink. And skipping queues.
-That's what it is. -Great, no queuing. No queues.
What you really wanna ask was, Joe,
"Has Niall changed since I've become famous?"
And the answer is a big, fat fucking yes.
-Thanks, mate, cheers. -Thanks, mate.
Just get a bit pissed at dinner and go try to write a song,
-is that what we're doing? -Yeah.
-Yeah. -Is that lager?
[Tom] Sometimes cider.
"Finchy, lager…"
"Different drinks for different needs."
[Pete] Don't you need to like, nail it?
-Awesome. -Yeah.
[Lewis] I'm a professional, so I'll probably nail it the first time.
Whatever, mate.
-[Pete] Just do it line by line. -Come on then. Let's rock.
[Lewis] You know what I mean? One, two, three!
It's so low, man.
-[Pete] Let's bloody rock. -A bit of rock and roll, that's my rule.
[Lewis] Hello?
-[Ryan] How are you? -I'm good. How are you?
Pretty good. Um…
Thinking about timelines.
Like, realistically we want, you know,
a song out at the top of next year at some stage.
No, totally.
And then the actual writing, what are you thinking, time-wise?
-You know? -[sighs] Um, yeah, we need to do more…
Should we do the fucking mad blitz of cuts in London?
I mean, literally, whenever, like, whenever you want. Like…
[Lewis] You see a man with my pizza?
-We did it. -[Zak] Come on, it's closing!
-[Lewis] Yes! -Yeah!
If you want pizza, all you have to do, and this is crucial,
is be famous.
Easy.
I feel like I'm on EastEnders.
I feel it awkward that you can't feel it through your pain.
[Dan] What do you want to do today?
That's the million dollar question.
Million dollar, sad boy question.
You've got 120 sad songs to pick from.
-Yeah -121.
This is it.
♪ Do I cry every night? ♪
A bit too depressing to start the chorus with,
"Do I cry every night?"
-Are you fine? You sure? Yeah. -Did you listen to the first record?
I'm happy to be led by you.
[Nick] The beauty is, you were left alone on the first one.
[Lewis] Yeah. At times, it was a bit nerve-racking
because it was, like, I don't know how to make an album.
But it turns out if you just write songs you like and release it.
♪ Hey, Lewis, what you gonna sing? ♪
♪ I don't know ♪
[sighs] I'm feeling a bit dizzy.
[Dan] Sorry you're feeling rough, mate.
[Lewis] I'm not confident in my abilities as a songwriter.
And I think it's got worse, the more successful I've got. [chuckles]
"Someone You Loved" was really fucking big.
If you wanna talk about a turning point, that's it.
Things just blew up.
[DJ 1] Six weeks at the top.
[DJ 2] It's been streamed over one billion times.
-Smash hit single, "Someone You Loved." -"Someone You Loved."
-Lewis… -My friend, Lewis Capaldi.
[all] America's sweetheart!
[Tom Jones] The award for the Song of the Year goes to…
Lewis Capaldi!
♪ And then you pulled the rug ♪
♪ I was getting kinda used to being Someone you loved… ♪
Uh… hello. [chuckles]
Hello. Eh…
My name is Lewis.
Eh… Thanks very… Thanks very much, uh, for this.
Eh, contrary to popular belief,
a lot of people think this song is about my ex-girlfriend,
who you can now see every night on Love Island, but… [chuckles]
But it's actually about my grandmother
who has sadly, sadly, sadly passed away a few years ago.
Eh, and I hope to God that ITV don't contact her
to be on a reality dating TV show.
But, yeah, no, thank you so much,
this has been the best, the best year of my life. Eh…
Thanks to everyone like you, to the label.
Thanks to my mum and dad for, I don't know, making love, uh,
and, um, and yeah, thanks to my grandmother for,
uh, dying? Sorry.
I'll see you later. Bye-bye. Thanks so much. Thanks.
Big celebrity bash tonight at the BRIT Awards.
It's going to be electric.
So obviously, I felt like I had to push the boat out…
and buy a new pair of Vans.
Won some awards at the last one… which was nice.
I performed at the last one. And this time, I'm just…
there, quite literally.
Which is quite sad.
I wonder what Elton John's going to sing today.
He sent me quite a lovely email. Have I told you about this email?
I was having beers with Ed Sheeran.
And I was telling him about my impostor syndrome situation.
Elton sent me an email saying, "Dear Lewis,
I was talking to Ed yesterday and we talked about you."
"He said you were feeling like an impostor."
"Bollocks!" That's in full capital letters.
"You are totally your own man."
"Your album is still riding high all over the world."
"And it's your first album!" That's also in capital letters.
"You write beautiful songs that resonate with millions."
"You are great live, a wonderful singer."
"You are also very funny and original. I mean this sincerely."
"Stop it now, please, or I will come up to Suffolk
and bring out the latent homo in you."
"Buckets of love, Elton."
No, I mean, it's nice to hear this stuff,
but I obviously still feel a bit like an impostor.
I don't think it's ever gonna go away,
the whole thing of "Why am I? I shouldn't be here."
I'll go here today and be like, "What the fuck am I doing here?"
For sure.
Impostor syndrome, I think you can have that at any level.
That bleeds into every single decision you make and everything you do.
It's always just seemed alien,
people that turn up and see me live and see me playing.
I love the fact that people do give a fuck and listen to my music.
I just don't get it, I don't get why people would turn up and see it,
but I'm eternally grateful and I fucking…
I can't thank people enough, but I just don't…
I… I love you, but I will never understand you.
[chuckling] That's what I'm trying to say to you all at home. Um…
Yeah, I just don't get it.
Yeah, I just don't. I don't know.

[Lewis] Cunts at my school, like, quite small-towny.
I know loads of folk who are married, who were in my year at school,
and who have kids from my old school.
[Edd] I always remember 25 was the age I put on, like,
"I'll have things. I'll have my career set."
-"I'll know what I'm doing at 25." -I've never thought about that.
[Edd] You hoped you figured out what you wanted by then.
And it's not as simple as that.
-You still don't have it figured out. -Goalpost's always changing.
You don't ever enjoy something 'cause you're like, "Fuck, the next thing…"
[Phil] It is that thing where you're always looking forward
and never looking at what you've actually done.
It's shite. [chuckles]
-Yeah. -Well, that's it. Is that it?
[Lewis] There's another one, but it's shite.
I wouldn't say it's one of your better ones.
No.
I feel as if the stuff that you've written before,
the writing was better than that.
Obviously, in my professional opinion.
-I like the one that-- -[Lewis] By the way--
You've opened a can of worms here.
[Carol] Saying you won't really… I really…
They've never… They weren't musical ever in their lives.
[Mark] What's that one?
-[Carol] I'm not saying I'm musical. -No, but--
-[Mark] You seem annoyed. -No. I'm not annoyed at all.
[Mark] You used to ask me your opinion.
-And I would give you it. -But… No.
You don't have to be musical to know if you like a song.
[Lewis] I'm not saying you do. You're getting too defensive.
What I'm saying is, it's funny now, when I first started playing them songs,
"That's good. That's bad."
And now it's, "And the lyrics here, I would maybe change those lyrics."
What do I know? What the fuck do I know?
[Lewis] That's a good point.
[Carol] But is the music the real Lewis, though?
-[Lewis] Good question, Mummy. -No?
-[Lewis] Guess you'll never know. -[chuckles]
[Lewis] Hi! Hello! [Flossie] Lewis, what's going on with writing, then?
-Who you been working with? -[Lewis] Eh…
I'm starting to get to that time where we have to start mixing it up
and being in with more people.
[Ryan] Yeah, I think, yeah, it's been slow.
-We're not gonna lie. It's been slow. -We'll see how we get on.
Listen, if it's shite, it's shite, it's you guys' job to make it successful.
[man] Have you had a word on live?
Any gigs and that, when are you gonna do them?
[Ryan] Everyone's, you know, pretty pessimistic.
[Lewis] You're writing and it feels aimless,
"What the fuck am I actually, like, writing for
if we don't know if we're going to play fucking gigs?"
It just feels like right now,
but the thing is, hopefully, it all starts to open back up.
-[Flossie] Much love. -[Lewis] See you soon!
Bye.
I think they thought they would hear some music.
Fucking hell.
Oh, come on now.
These are making me want to go find a trampoline somewhere…
and suplex my friends.
Mmm. The good old days.
[hesitates] Right, I keep my johnnies.
Keep them right by my WWE wrestling trading cards.
My parents are moving, so I'm moving all my shit out of the house.
They've lived here for 15 years, so it's pretty heavy.
Fuck.
I don't live here anymore, so who cares?
Me and my pals used to come in here and get pissed all the time.
And there wasn't any plaques or anything on the wall
when I was coming in and I was trying to write songs and stuff, and, um…
Yeah, it's weird to, then, over the years,
actually have it fill up with plaques.
"Someone You Loved," actually, I started writing…
here.
I wrote it here.
So… so, yeah. Big, eh… Big room.
I still think about it sometimes
when I think of being back at school and being like,
"Oh, I didn't know that this was going to be
this sort of path your life's gonna go down,
is this fucking mad…"
"Mad thing."
This is the first one I got.
My manager gave me. My first EPs.
I'm pretty sure this is the equivalent of 1.5 million units sold
and I'm sure he made that up completely.
This feeling of getting older, like I'm an adult.
This is fucking shit.
And to not have your childhood home where you grew up, it's a bit…
That's also a weird thing.
I don't know why, but when I think of that,
I feel really odd.
I get a knot in my stomach.
Not being here anymore,
feels like kind of one of the last… things
feels like kind of one of the last… things about my life beforehand that's not there.
Feels like a safety net kind of thing.
And us this not being here anymore, that feels a bit strange.
It's very definite.
[exhales sharply] This house is, like… someone else's house now.
Cool.
All done.
Okay, someone else will come pick these up and get rid of this, obviously.
I'll pay the man for that.
Cool.
"My God. He's so normal. Puts on his…"
"Look at him, hanging up his own washing."
I don't know what they sniff for smells.
You got a really tight shot.
I think they're clean.
I've been away doing this other thing
and from a personal standpoint, I'm probably in the exact same position
as I was in three years ago,
because I haven't matured at all in the last three years.
Put these here.
I'm moving in with my pal, Niall.
I've never lived with someone else before.
Half the BRIT just fell off.
[Lewis] And the rest of my pals, are happily shacked up with their lovers.
And I am not, so,
I needed someone who could, eh, just pacify me for a bit.
Home is something that's becoming increasingly harder to, like,
stay connected to.
[Ryan] Did you look through this list of songs you've written?
[Lewis] No.
[Ryan] This is literally 54 songs you've written.
-[Lewis] I feel like I've written more. -[Ryan] This is, like, full songs.
♪ This all-too-well familiar pain ♪
♪ It comes and it goes ♪ ♪ But it gets in my bones all the same ♪
-[song stops] -[Ryan] So what do we think?
Is it a hit single as it is, do we think?
[chuckles] What a fucking question, Ryan.
[Ryan] But those are the questions. That's what we've got to fucking answer.
It doesn't feel as, like, widely appealing as "Someone You Loved."
[Ryan] Yeah. Do you want to listen to "How This Ends"?
[Lewis] Let's do it.
[Aiden] Yeah, I like this.
[Ryan] The refrain is going to be incredible.
[Lewis] I don't hear it as a single.
-The song is amazing. -[Ryan] It is really good.
-And it's really emotional. -[Ryan] It is.
-It'll make people cry. -[Ryan] Yeah.
Which is the aim of the game.
-[Ryan] Of course. -[Lewis] What else is there?
[Ryan] Listen to "Haven't You Ever Been In Love Before?"
[Lewis] Let's do it.
[Lewis over speakers] ♪ And she said this ♪
♪ "Haven't you ever Been in love before?" ♪
So what we thinking then, on that?
♪ "Haven't you ever Been in love before?" ♪
It's maybe… It's quite like,
♪ I was getting kinda used to being Someone you loved ♪
[Ryan] And fucking what?
That's what I was saying. Just making sure. That's a good thing?
-[Ryan] That's a good thing. -Cool.
Not to be condescending to people, people love stuff that sounds the same.
What's your thought, Aiden?
Folk want something a bit exciting coming back.
[Ryan] Do they?
Do they just want the fucking same, but better, or the same?
The thing is, if the song's fucking great. Does it matter?
[Ryan] Maybe it doesn't.
Which is… Which is why we're…
-Fuckers. It's a real pain. -It is.
-Fucking pain in the arse. -I've put all my eggs in one basket.
I know you have as well, but if I fuck it up--
Well, you say that as if it's not my name on it.
[Aiden] You're talking about that basket.
[Ryan] This is definitely an all-in-one-basket situation,
so that's what makes it even more like, if I fuck it up…
Obviously, still do good live business and stuff.
He's saying that, "I put all my eggs in one basket,"
-as if I'm not here. -[laughter]
And I'm not the person called Lewis Capaldi, whose name's on everything.
Do we have a big single?
I don't know. I don't know.
Are these as good as "Someone You Loved" and "Before You Go"?
Any point releasing a single not as good as "Someone You Loved"?
Then you could just never release a song ever again.
Of course there's pressure.
There's pressure on you to manage it correctly.
[Ryan] Yeah. Which I'm terrified of.
Okay, well, you worry about that and I'll worry about writing.
[Ryan] Let's do it.
-Lovely. -[Ryan] Safe, bro.
Smashing, I'll just go knock out a "Someone You Loved" for you now.
-Hello. -[man] Did you just get here?
Turn out the dogs in the garden.
Sat in separate rooms, is it?
Young love's dream.
Shows you how much my parents love each other.
-[indistinct chatter] -[Mark] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Two different living rooms.
So they don't have to spend time with each other.
[Mark] I'm not allowed in her room.
[Lewis] Hello.
-[Carol] Hello. -He's quick, isn't he?
[Mark] You're twitching again.
I am. I twitch every day, every single day of my life.
[Mark] I thought you were going to do something about it.
-What would-- -[Mark] Chiropractor.
-Chiropractor doesn't help it. -[Mark] So what helps?
-Fuck all. -[Mark] So you gotta keep that twitch?
See if you google "anxious twitches."
You will find shoulder shrugging as the top one.
-[Mark] How do you get rid of it? -Don't know.
I can't tell you.
I get it when I'm in traffic, it flares up.
[Mark] Do you get it when you're in training? Yep.
-[Mark] You get it in training. -When I get proper exhausted
and in a big thingy, it gets really bad.
-So maybe stop training? -[Carol] No.
Because that's… That triggers it, so I should stop.
-You're not supposed to mention it. -How?
Why am I not supposed to mention it?
[Lewis] Because you draw attention to it.
So you just kid on it's not there?
And you don't deal with it?
-Yes? -[Lewis] I deal with it.
-How are you dealing with it? -It comes and goes.
It's part of life, brother.
Get used to it.
[Carol] Stop. You make it worse when you mention it.
We know he does it, so you just ignore it.
I don't know I can ignore it.
Why? So that you can draw attention and make it worse?
It's going to get worse.
Because it's getting closer and closer
to this having to be finished.
I don't know.
[Mark] I think there's more pressure on him than we thought it was.
[Carol] He's going to be worried
that it's not going to be as good as people are expecting.
And then he's let everybody down, I suppose.
But you can only do what you can do.
I know you think he's quite laid-back.
We think you're quite laid-back on most things,
-but clearly not. -[Lewis] What?
-You come across as… -[Mark] The album coming.
…somebody that's quite laid-back.
I suppose you could always say, "He had a good run."
[Lewis] I could say that, for sure.
Well…
[Lewis] That'll do.
I've ordered new shoes, which should come today, I think.
I am going to Los Angeles, the City of Angels,
to do a big chunk of writing.
Um… Which is exciting.
Ideally, I would like to come back with, like,
an album's worth of really good songs.
Writing with all these amazing people
that we didn't write with, the first album,
because we weren't as successful.
It's nervy as well because I've been a bit twitchy
and a bit panicky at points, so that's a bit of a…
It's definitely something that's crossed my mind that I'll be over there alone.
Oh, God.
That's done.
It's packed.
[imitates airplane flying] And then like a plane going… And then we're in LA.
That'll be the next bit.
♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Let me see y'all, come on ♪
♪ I wanna see y'all standin' right now ♪
[Lewis] This is a good buzz.
Anticipation fills the air.
[Lewis] LA.
This is it.
This is living.
[Lewis] These are my yogas. My yoga notes.
"Down Dog. Warrior One."
"Triangle, twisted triangle. Side angle."
"Improves digestion, metabolism, circulation and sex drive."
Gonna be an absolute fuck machine by the time this is done.
[Amy] Have you guys worked yet?
-Dan and I did a song on my first-ever EP. -Oh!
When I heard "Bruises" I remember being like,
"I need to work with this person."
"I don't know who this is, but this song is crazy."
-[Amy] So good. -Yeah.
[Amy] Do you have a bunch of shows lined up?
So we've got, um, festivals, tours booked fucking all over, we'll see how we get on.
I do love it, but it's, like… I think it's quite daunting now,
the thought of it, do you know what I mean?
[Dan] Because of COVID, or just because…
This is the longest I've ever been in my life without playing a live show.
[Amy] You'll feel like that until your first one, you're on stage,
and you're like, "I'm so fucking happy."
Fingers crossed, but yeah. It'll be good.
I'm chuffed, but it's like,
I can't think past the album just now,
-you know what I mean? -[Amy] I get that.
-[Amy] I like that. -[Lewis] Yeah.
'Cause the end one isn't going to be…
You can go rogue on the end one.
[Dan] Yeah, but I like it because…
♪ Give me good news down in the… ♪
-Yeah. -[Amy] Yeah.
I don't know if good… Does "Good News" feel strong enough of a--
[Amy] I can't tell.
[Lewis] I wouldn't really put it where we're putting it.
-You wouldn't put it there? -[Lewis] I'd put it right at the end.
And it would be like that would be the thing at the end,
but you'd have to… And the lyric would be…
I'm also not tied to that concept.
I'm trying to figure out what the emotional angle
to "Good News" would be.
-Yeah, totally. -[clears throat]
'Cause that's what's so strong about your songs,
is they're always like, they're just fucking emotional.
Like, how to make that term feel like that.
Yeah.
[Lewis] Again, I'm not tied to that as well.
The way I write songs is I sit at a piano for four hours and I hate myself.
It feels like this is fucking hard and I'm shit at writing songs.
My twitch that I have gets worse when I sit down to play piano.
Physically painful.
And I get really short of breath and it's like…
My back fucking kills me when I go to do it.
Which is quite… frightful.
I'm just trying to work out… what I'm going to do.
[Jen] Everyone at Spotify calls you Lulu now.
-Sorry 'cause I started that. -[Lewis] Well.
[Jen] They sent… like, you got a billions plaque for "Before You Go."
-That got sent to you? -Yeah.
[Jen] And so Spotify emails me and they're like,
"We got Lulu's billionaire's plaque."
They should've put that on the name.
I forward to Ryan and go, "I'm sorry,
I have the entire team calling him Lulu, and I'm okay with it."
Can we hear anything?
-[Lewis] I can't play it now. -[Jamie] It's still a work in progress.
-And he's right to-- -Hey!
-I mean, it's undeniable. -Yeah. Thank you.
Can we, like, try to work out like… how to come back?
-You don't wanna just put a song out. -[Jen] It's gotta be a moment.
[Sam] What've you been up to, outside of writing before you got here?
Nothing.
[Arjun] Does it feel good to get off the island or no?
-Eh… It's definitely weird. -[Arjun] Yeah?
It feels pure, like, not real.
I've got a twitch now. Never had a twitch before.
-I do this. -[Jen] You've always done that.
-[Sam] I feel like-- -Thanks, guys. Um…
-It's worse now. -[Sam] Part of the personality.
Need to go sort that out.
[Jen] Do you think it's because of pent-up energy?
No, I think it's anxiety, but I don't know where it's coming from.
Once I sort this out, I'll be good to go, but it's like…
-[Sam] You see a therapist at all? -No.
[Sam] I've been going for a year. Changed my life.
I think it's worth finding someone now you can stick with through--
Totally. Sure.
[man 1] Can I just be clear, are we actually firing the pyro?
-[man 2] Yes… -[man 1] Is that cue in ten?
-[man 3] Okay, firing. -[man 1] The cue numbers have gone.
It came on way too early.
We need to get the timing of that right.
Doesn't look that big, does it?
[Lewis] Good gig last night.
I can't remember anything because I was so, uh, scared.
Um, but hopefully a good gig tonight.
Is this okay?
Right.
[Carol] All the way through the whole arena tour, you could just see him.
Every time he played a gig, it was a struggle.
And then it came to a head at Wembley.
Fuck me.
Sorry, I'm just going to have to stop for two seconds. Is that okay? Sorry.
My back is fucking killing me.
[Mark] And he fucking… He stopped singing.
So I bolted, ran down the stairs.
And I'm fucking… The crowd's all quiet.
I'm shouting "Luigi! Come on! Keep going, keep going."
I'm breaking… I'm breaking my heart.
But you see him. And that's… That's fucking… It's bad.
[Lewis] This twitch became out of control.
And it was awful. It was absolutely horrific.
I started to get in my head about, you know,
these pressures about things are being like,
"Fuck, there's like, skin in the game now."
Rather than just me singing my silly little songs.
Other people are depending on me.
[Carol] Is it worth it?
Making you feel like this?
This next year, if all goes well,
it's going to be even bigger, so it's even more pressure
and you think, "How is he going to…"
"How will he get through it?"
[Lewis] Hello.
[Mark] What's happening?
-Fuck all. What's happening with you? -[Mark] Fuck all.
-Who else would you like to write with? -[Lewis] I took Thursday and Friday off.
I could go home now.
You could just come out and you're like,
"All right, I could do a month,
two months, three months, a year, whatever."
Already I'm like, "Fuck! I could go home."
I will speak to you tomorrow probably.
-[Carol] Okey dokey. -[Lewis] Love you. Bye.
I never thought about failing before,
it's something I've thought about the last couple of weeks.
A lot more. I don't know if that's maybe playing into
me not wanting to write songs.
My own confidence in my own abilities being lower now,
despite the fact that we've just done something quite incredible.
It still stems from that sort of…
"I won't be able to write any good stuff."
"Let's go to LA where all the best writers and producers are, and write with them."
"And maybe they will come up with some magic or whatever."
It just doesn't work like that.
Some days, I think, "This album's gonna, fucking be ready to go, gonna be class,"
and other days I'm like, "Fuck, this is…"
[sighs] "…a million miles off." So…
Yeah.
I'm not really sure.
Do I even know what I like?
Now.
I think we put so much focus on making this album a more cohesive…
altogether body of work,
that it would be nice if people listened to it in that way.
[Carol] Is the music the real Lewis?
[Lewis] I feel like I'm in a race against the clock
to get my mental health in order.
[Carol] If the phone rings at a certain time, then I know what the issue is.
[Lewis] When I have a panic attack… it feels like I'm going insane.
Completely disconnected from reality.
I can't breathe. Like, I can't feel my breath going in.
It's fucking… it's wild.
I get dizzy, I feel something happening in my head
and I'm sweating.
My whole body starts to do what my shoulder does.
Like, pure convulsing.
And the big thing for me with it is like that thing of,
"I'm always going to feel like this now. This is me. I'm like permode."
And, yeah, I'm just like, "Oh, fuck, I'm… This is it."
Either I feel like I'm going to be stuck like that forever or I'm going to die.
His heart's pounding really, really fast.
He sometimes feels as if his vision's going.
His pulse is racing.
He's just…
He feels like he's dying. He says, "I feel as if I'm dying."
It's not Lewis speaking.
Panicking to the extent he can't breathe correctly.
And she's calm, gets him breathing and talking through, kind of like,
for hours, up to seven hours.
Although that helps, uh,
it's not as good as having somebody physically there with you.
If something happens to you, there's nobody there to help.
It was such a big change to his life.
You just think you're going to be a bit overwhelmed at times with stuff,
so just try and relax.
You're absolutely fine.
But because he's such a hypochondriac, everything,
Lewis always thinks that there's this big catastrophe going on,
that he's maybe got a brain tumor or something.
He told me the whole way through primary school
that he had a brain tumor.
I've always been, I've always had hypochondria,
I've been obsessed with, like, "Fuck!"
Like if something's wrong with me, I'm like, "Fuck, I'm dying."
I went to a therapist, she was like,
"Do you not think that's maybe got something to do with the fact
that your grandmother and your aunt
both died when you were, like, three and four,
within a year of one another in a short space of time?"
"So you're surrounded by this."
You're immediately faced with this thing, "People die."
[man] What is it?
Well, Lewis, it's obvious you're gonna get a Game Boy.
She committed suicide. Uh…
I was there, I saw a lot of things and stuff.
We were outside the flat the night my dad went upstairs and found her.
You feel so guilty that you didn't manage to stop it.
But I think you could drive yourself absolutely insane with it,
you need to get to the point and think,
"Well… you can't stop somebody doing something."
Do you know what I mean? You can try and help.
Give them as much support as you can.
But unless they want to help themselves, there's not much you can do about it.
Because if you don't think, stop, get rid of…
I still feel guilty about it.
I still feel as if, um…
I need to stop. [crying]

[Lewis] "Before You Go" is a song about my aunt.
I'm coming at it from an observer's standpoint.
But I've never, like, discussed what that must feel like for her,
hearing that tune.
Sorry.
My sister had had problems for a long time, so…
I don't know.
It was a hard time, but the song just seems to kind of capture
the whole feeling, know what I mean?
It's like, uh, the questions that Carol definitely asks herself on a daily basis.

♪ Kills me how your mind Can make you feel so worthless ♪
♪ So ♪
♪ Before you go ♪
[Lewis] People make it to 40 and not have a fucking relative die.
So I think something that's like trickled into my subconscious
is that our time here is, like, finite.
That feeds into my anxieties about my own health and my own mortality.

[crowd] ♪ Before you go ♪
I mean, I think everybody's complicated.
They've got things that they keep to themselves,
and that's just Lewis.
He's not just the comedian that we all think he is.
And that's where the conflict possibly is as well,
because the darkness comes over the happy chappy guy
and manifests itself in all the tics,
the anxiety and all the other things that he's kind of surrounded in.
Yeah.
But definitely it makes me reflect a lot
on how I've got to go forward in kind of
dealing with my boy.
[Matt] Hello, everybody.
This is a singer-songwriter whose debut album
sold over ten million copies worldwide.
Someone who's sold over a million concert tickets
and gone from pubs to clubs to arenas
and enormous festival crowds in just a few years.
And he's done so while remaining resolutely himself.
So please welcome to the stage, Lewis Capaldi!
[Matt] How are ya?
-[Lewis] I am fucking warm. -[chuckles]
Life all right?
[sighs] Well, living one day to the next before my eventual demise.
Do you know what I mean?
[Matt] The expectation is… is huge.
The success of the first one made me feel more insecure
and sort of self-conscious about my own abilities.
If I have a song that does well, you're like, "Yes!"
"Oh, let's get an album that does well." "Yeah. Okay, cool, next one."
"Let's have another single that does well."
"Fuck, okay, cool."
Then it's, "Let's do another album, hopefully that does well."
It's been a looming thing. This sort of pressure.
I think I've never been more insecure in my life than I am now.
You spend a lot of time thinking about that?
Oh, yeah, big time, I'm thinking about it now.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, give it up for Lewis Capaldi!
[Lewis] Nice one. Thank you.
-[Ryan] Are you all right? -[Lewis] I was so warm.
-[Ryan] Anxious as well. -[Lewis] I'm just--
You were great, but it's obviously very difficult.
I find it difficult to watch you.
[Lewis] Just one of those, one of these things.
-It's not. -[Lewis] It is.
-You can't just… -[Lewis] What can I do?
But you're in pain because of that.
[Lewis] Oh, that's good.
Okay. Cool, let's do it.
[Joe] It's been a while. How you feeling?
Like we're saying you turn someone's world upside down,
you change your life, loads of cunts know who they are.
It's for singing songs.
For me, it seems like a completely normal reaction to this.
If you're put in this situation, you're going to have something like this,
especially if you're already quite an anxious person,
which I guess I was.
I didn't ever have the pressure that came to make me go,
like, full-blown, but we're there now.
So… I just need to deal with it.
[man] Lewis.
Oh, yes!
[Carol] What do you think, Lewis?
[Carol] When he was younger he used to blink all the time.
Thought it was 'cause he was in front of the TV too long,
staring at it.
He would occasionally make this wee noise. "Mm, mm-hmm."
But then it went away.
He did that when he was about five or six, then it all came back.
[Mark] The twitch. There's no control over it.
To watch, it's fucking horrible.
[Carol] He used to get these comments on everything as well.
"Oh, he's been taking Charlie or whatever it is. And drugs."
And that's when we had to make a stand, to say,
"We need to find what this is, what's happening here."
This twitch became out of control, I didn't know what it was at the time.
I've since learned that I have Tourette's.
Right, that makes complete sense now, when I look back.
I got told I had Tourette's a week ago.
Know how many people I've told I have Tourette's since?
It's outrageous. People think I'm bragging.
But it's just good to like, "I've got this thing by the way."
"This is what it makes me do."
Do you know what I mean? If I know I'm not… I know I'm not dying.
[Carol] They had given him a plan of how they could treat it.
So… it's a relief.
-[man] Come in. Come and take a seat. -[Lewis] Thanks very much.
[Lewis] Their thing to me was like,
"I think it's just if you can decrease your baseline anxiety
by as much as possible,
you'll see a marked improvement in any tics
or twitches or whatever."
[Magnus] All the way back. Toes in.
-Come up a little higher. -Jesus.
Jesus on the cross. [laughing]
You can see a difference from this muscle to the muscle on this side.
There's a treatment therapy that they can give for it.
Tilt your neck back.
There's a therapy where they try and change your tic.
-Two, one. Awesome. -Cool.
Take… take five breaths when you go in with maximum air.
[Lewis] I've got a therapist. Just finding one is a fucking pain in the ring.
One gave me homework which I was like,
"You're adding more anxiety in my life."
I was doing the homework out in my car outside her house
just before I went in, I was like, "This is awful."
I'm on these fucking pills, Sertraline, they're not doing anything
except for I can't get a fucking hard-on to save my life.
Sorry.
And they gave me the shits for six weeks, so that was great.
Right, come here.
[Lewis] I know what the steps are to get better.
The onus is on me to do it.
I can't expect anybody else to click their fingers, and it's done.
And I know that in myself, I can.
I can do it.
-[man 1] It's nice stuff. -[man 2] Yeah, that's nice.
-Cheers, mate. Thank you. -Thanks.
-Fuck. -[chuckles]
[laughs] It's class.
[Ryan] We're hardcore Peloton addicts now.
You do, you just feel good afterwards, just fucking dripping with sweat,
I feel like I've just done something with my worthless day.
[Lewis] I started exercising really only properly last week.
I'd say I shifted like a stone initially and now I'm back up, like…
six pounds. So about half a stone down. Whoo-hoo.
This lady's been cooking me food, which is nice,
but it's just, I wish there was more of it.
She keeps putting… I don't like cheese. She keeps putting cheese in it.
I mean, this actually looks pretty fucking gross.
We'll give it a go?
I mean, yesterday I had a McDonald's, so…
-We did, um-- -[Joe] But you worked out?
I did, I worked out twice yesterday.
Once in the morning, once at night.
So, I don't think that's… I don't think that's the point.
I think you don't do that,
then go, "I've exercised twice, I'll have a McDonald's."
But, um…
I was a bit hungover, so I had two McDonald's, so…
Okay. So I actually had two McDonald's yesterday.
It was class.
A welcome break.
There you have it.
Chicken masala with cashew nuts that I don't like
in under two minutes.
Started to see a therapist lady, she's been great.
So I speak to her once a week at the moment.
I'm doing stuff even when I feel good,
rather than just waiting until I feel like shit.
There are still days when it's a pain in the arse.
But for the most part, it's a much more manageable thing.
Working on a song called "Forget Me," which I like a lot.
It seems everything has been a bit more
of a considered approach rather than just, um,
"We'll change stuff for the sake of changing it,"
and actually thinking about, um, the song
and what it may need.
Let's rock. [grunts]
-I wish I looked cooler doing that. -[woman laughing]
I look like a wee boy jumping down from a high chair.
Fuck.
-[Tom Barnes] Praise Lewis Capaldi. -[Lewis] This is…
-[mimics fanfare] -What's going on here?
All right, let's do some work.
I'll do the vocal on "Forget Me" now, I think.
♪ Hello, hello, hello ♪
-[Barnes] You all right? -Let's just go for it.
♪ Days ache and nights are long ♪
♪ Two years and still, you're not gone ♪
♪ Guess I'm still holding on ♪
♪ Drag my name through the dirt ♪
♪ Somehow it doesn't hurt though ♪
♪ Guess you're still holding on ♪
"Forget Me" feels like a funny way to come back.
With like a song where the main lyric is,
"I'm not ready to find out you know how to forget me."
For someone who's been away for three years and the rest of it,
it does speak to my ego slightly.
♪ I'm not ready to let you forget me To let you forget me, to let you for… ♪
♪ I'm not ready to let you forget me To let you forget me, to let you for… ♪
♪ Oh-oh I'm not ready to let you forget me To let you forget me, to let you for… ♪
-[Ben] What the fuck! -[Barnes] He's done it.
This fucking sounds amazing.
-It does. -[Ben] That's really good.
-The vocal sounds fucking great. -I'm really chuffed about that.
[Lewis] Music is something I really care about.
One of the few things I care about enough to put that much pressure on myself.
If it's only you putting pressure on yourself,
it's only you who can, like… stop.
[Ben] What I wanna do is a tune that's totally fucking different, like that,
that no one's going to think that's you.
I do think that's going to have that vibe of like,
"What, that's Lewis?" Which is pretty cool.
[Lewis] Totally.
I think that "Forget Me" will be the first single.
Having that done is just a big weight off my shoulders.
It's a buzz and a half, it's class.
Me thinking someone else has the answers to my problems,
and I can't expect anybody else to do the album for me.
I need to take responsibility.
Yep. That works.
Hello.
[Robbie] Hello?
Two bars good for you or do you want a bit more?
[Lewis] Wrong!
[Lewis] I feel like we're doing quite a lot of laundry-related filming in this.
Bingo!
Hello. How you doing?
I'm gonna come and sing with you.
Been a tough day.
Hello, all. I'm Lewis.
Thanks very much for coming and doing this.
I'm proud of the album. I do fucking think it's great.
It alleviates a lot of the stress.
[Lewis] Thank you so much.
Honestly, it means the world, it sounds fucking incredible, so…
[Ryan] I'm about to lock the US tour.
What we should do is make smart decisions
and not play too many shows.
Definitely not four shows in a row,
even with two in a row, you want two days off afterwards.
If we're gonna do this, we're doing all the things again
and we're doing it properly.
[Ryan] Work at the same pace now,
if you want to do two weeks on two weeks off.
That feels good.
[Lewis] Cheers, nice work. See ya later.
And you.
-That is fucking brilliant. -Yeah, that is good.
[Lewis] It's that…
♪ Haven't you ever been in love before? ♪
[man 1] That's the catchiest melody I've ever heard.
-It's a feel-good chorus. -Ever!
Even though it's a heartbreak, it's very "up."
[Ryan] It's gonna be a good album.
[Lewis] But I feel like… I do feel like we're in a good place.
The last two years have been a bit all over the shop.
The fact that the album reflects that in some ways could be a good thing.
I listen to the album and I'm like, "I really like this."
-[Greg] He's back. -[Lewis] I'm back.
[Greg] Lewis Capaldi is back.
But you're properly… This is it now?
-You're back? -I'm back.
But I just want to put into perspective what's about to happen.
You're back with new music. Your first album came out in May 2019.
-True. -That's a long time ago.
-It is a long time. -A lot has happened in the world.
There's been a pandemic, a war.
And still, "Lewis Capaldi has got a new single out,"
is the worst thing that could potentially be said to the British public.
But, um, it's good to be back.
This is highly anticipated.
It's… Your first album was the biggest selling album in the UK
in 2019 and 2020.
-I'm nervous. -Why?
Because…
You just said it was highly anticipated.
But there's a lot of love coming your way.
-Yeah. -Right, hit the space bar.
-Has that worked? -[laughter]
-[Lewis] Michael! Michael! -[man] Michael!
-[space bar clacks] -Launch.
That is a bad omen. That is a bad omen.
Launch.
-[Lewis] Launch. -Hit it!

And B12 helps transportation of oxygen.
Great.
-It's gonna pick you up a little. -Lovely.
[Lewis] Right now, I find it very hard to see a way back to playing on stage.
This thing I did every single day, I can't believe I ever did that.
Having this feeling… It feels like you're starting all over again.
It's quite large.
I kind of wrestle with the magnitude of things.
It's now become this bigger thing
and it means stuff to other people.
[Ryan] There's a lot of pressure.
It's the third one you need to worry about.
-Fucking nervous. -If the second one's shite…
He's not selling another one.
[Lewis] Okay. Should I be changed?
-Do you want me to change? -[man] Yeah.

handle it all.
[stage manager] Band to stage.
All right. Ready. Three, two, one.
Lovely.
[Carol] We're still seeing him as Lewis.
And then there's this other Lewis who stands up onstage
and sings to thousands of people.
[Carol] If he can go through all this,
even the things that he's struggling with
will make him stronger as well.
I'm extremely proud of him.
[Carol] Hopefully we'll be enough to keep him going until he finds
the one. [chuckles]
[Mark] Very proud. Very proud of him.
As far as I'm concerned,
his health is more important to me than anything else.
You kind of look out for him, even though he doesn't want it.
[Lewis] The only reason I started writing music was so I could play it live.
I'd really like it to become like a full-on career thing
that I can do till I'm, you know…
I mean, I won't live till, fucking, whatever age Mick Jagger is,
but I just want to do the people around me proud
and myself proud.

In today's breaking news,
famous singer Amar Singh Chamkila and his wife Amarjot Kaur
have been murdered.
This afternoon,
in Mehsampur village near Jalandhar,
they were shot to death.
Two other members of his group,
Harjeet Gill and Baldev Debu, were also killed on the spot.
The shootout led to a stampede,
and the audience ran for their lives.
No one saw the face of the killers
who escaped the scene.
Chamkila was the most loved musician.
Many factions of the society…
Hey, look.
What?
What are you looking at?
Pecking his flesh off the bones…
You devoured my lover's body
He's dead!
Life is so fickle
There are no friends in the hour of need
Boss!
Hey! Come on, pick him up!
Fucking nuisance.
Just stay here.
The real fundamentalists didn't do this.
Else they'd take pride in his killing.
One of the gangs would have claimed responsibility by now.
Rumors say that some singers are involved in this.
Even petty thieves are claiming to be fundamentalists these days.
Then no one bothers them.
Money can get you anything.
Why is he coming here?
-We have to take the bodies to Ludhiana. -Stay away!
Okay, take them.
-You have to come along. -Are we your servants, fucker?
That area is not under our jurisdiction.
We can't come along.
This is Chamkila's body!
Don't you get it?
How can I take him by myself?
Did we tell him to sing vulgar songs?
He chose to.
You reap what you sow!
Chamkila.
Chamkila used to knit socks in a factory.
And you know what?
If it wasn't for me,
he'd still be knitting socks.
I made Chamkila.
I did that!
Well, you should've made something of yourself too.
Yeah.
This is my plight.
This is where I ended up.
Because I'm not a scoundrel like him.
I didn't betray anyone.
I didn't change with the times.
But he…
What good was he?
What was he?
Hello, sir.
You are amazing with dholak, Tikki bhai.
You make the song come alive.
-No. -What?
I'm saying no to whatever you're going to ask.
He wants to enter the field of music, paaji.
He's been making music since he was little.
He has worked in some plays too.
I need your help, paaji.
Son, I don't even help my father.
That's my problem.
-Oh. -Yes.
Well, that's a small problem.
But mine is a big one.
I knit socks at a factory. Socks.
Although music plays in my mind 24/7,
I have to knit socks.
-I'm sick of my life. -So what should I do?
Introduce me to Jatinder Jinda.
Why should I?
I'll remember it.
Who are you?
I'm no one today.
-But you'll be famous soon? -Yes.
Really?
You are quite a guy.
Should I come tomorrow?
Pop a pill of opium
The pill goes in, the mind flies
Once the eyes are fixed
They do not settle for anything small
Something sinful happened
It's very embarrassing
I'll get better if I keep playing.
Something happened, and it's not a lie
The unthinkable happened yesterday
Hey, I slipped suddenly
My bachelor brother-in-law lifted me up
Hey, I slipped suddenly
These were the female vocals. Now the male vocals.
Who wrote this song?
I did.
-You wrote it? -Yes.
The veil slipped off your face
Your beauty left me dazzled
Your bachelor brother-in-law lucked out
You went to the fields
And things worked out well
Hey, your bachelor brother-in-law
Grabbed you in his arms
Your bachelor brother-in-law
What have you brought, Tikki?
He became a servant in Jinda's office.
A guy with no status!
Your Chamkila used to bring me tea.
I never spoke to my brother-in-law
I never spoke to my brother-in-law
And you never helped me out
Your bachelor brother-in-law lucked out
You went to the fields
And things worked out well
And things worked out well
This is how it goes, sir.
And things worked out well
Hey, your bachelor brother-in-law
Grabbed you in his arms
Your bachelor brother-in-law
How long do we need to wait?
Come on, guys, cool down.
Jatinder Jinda will be here any moment.
So, guys, Bhangra is in trend these days.
These musicians are liars.
So when I was getting married--
Shut the fuck up! We want Jinda.
Where the hell is Jinda?
Call him!
Yes, yes.
Where the fuck is Jinda?
I was made to skip my show in Ropar, to be kept waiting here.
What do we do now?
Why did you come here? Go to the fucking stage. Play your dholak.
-Control the public. -Playing dholak is making them angrier.
-Control the public. -Playing dholak is making them angrier. They want to hear songs now.
What the hell, man? What the hell!
Let him go on stage. He'll manage till then.
What do you say?
Aren't you going to be somebody tomorrow?
Go on. Get on the stage.
He can sing and play tumbi too.
Don't mind, he's been writing all of Jinda's hit songs.
Send him. He'll handle it till then.
It's getting explosive out there.
Calm them down somehow.
Come on. Come on, get ready.
-Come on. -Come, let's go.
Your lyrics. "Quit your dirty tricks, you old fart."
Then I'll come in.
Firstly, sing with Jinda's servant, that too such dirty lyrics!
Yuck!
Sonia, Jinda has taken money for this show.
Audience will stone us. Forget about dirty lyrics.
-This is not the time for tantrums. -Hey!
Mind your language!
I have a standard to maintain, no matter what.
Come on, bhai, you'll sing alone.
Sing a duet alone? Both male and female vocals?
What's the option? Tell me!
Do whatever you can.
-Hey, come here. -Yes, sir?
-What is your name? -Amar Singh.
That doesn't sound like a singer. Anything else?
But that's my name.
Any catchy village or family name?
There is one. Sandila.
All right.
So, guys, I bring to you
a singer you've never seen or heard before.
The rising star of Panjab,
Amar Singh
Chamkila!
He announced my name wrong. It's Sandila.
Go on now.
Who's gonna remember your name tomorrow?
Get Jinda on stage.
We want to hear him.
Jinda! Jinda! Jinda!
What style is this? Why are you standing like a duck?
Who the hell is this fellow?
Who is this, paaji?
-We're not here for him. Call Jinda. -Jinda!
Quit your dirty tricks, you old fart
Quit your dirty tricks, you old fart
You're done for
You're done for
Your juice is all dried up now
Well-known in the neighboring villages
I'm strong enough to rip off this door
Well-known in the neighboring villages
I'm strong enough to rip off this door
Your days of youth are long gone
Yet you try to act like a young buck
Your days of youth are long gone
Yet you try to act like a young buck
Your slingshot is broken now
You're done for
You're done for
Your juice is all dried up now
Chopped many trees in my youth
Turned many girls into women
Like lightning this oldie
Like lightning this oldie Strikes his shots
I'm strong enough to rip off this door
Well-known in the neighboring villages
I'm strong enough to rip off this door
Please come.
Quit your dirty tricks, you old fart
Quit your dirty tricks, you old fart
You're done for
You're done for
Your juice is all dried up now
Chopped many trees in my youth
Turned many girls into women
Chopped many trees in my youth
Turned many girls into women
Like lightning this oldie Strikes his shots
Like lightning this oldie Strikes his shots
I'm strong enough to rip off this door
There you go.
It's the moment
you've all been waiting for!
Your favorite singer, Jatinder Jinda!
Forget Jinda.
We want Chamkila!
Chamkila! Chamkila! Chamkila!
Chamkila! Chamkila! Chamkila!
What are they saying?
Chamkila! Chamkila! Chamkila!
-Hello-- -Don't want Jinda!
Chamkila! Chamkila! Chamkila!
-Shall we go now? -Where?
To Chamkila's bungalow. That's where they'll take his body.
You know, people suspect us too. That we got Chamkila killed.
How can we go there?
Idiot, if we don't go there,
won't people's suspicions turn to belief?
What if the real fundamentalists are behind it
and they come to see who's with Chamkila?
We'll definitely go there.
It's our Chamkila, assholes!
One becomes dear after death, isn't it?
He was one of our own, man.
Our bhai.
But he didn't act like a bhai.
Shouldn't talk ill about him today.
Fine! Then I'll say it tomorrow.
But I'll say it!
-Hello, sir. -Hello.
Jinda showed his true colors.
He left for Canada without telling us.
Never. I'm also going to Canada.
Jinda promised me. Look.
What is this?
Ration card.
I don't have a passport.
But Jinda bhai said that's okay. This is enough to take me to Canada.
He fooled you!
Idiot.
Trashy local shows with Sonia,
and Kavita for the Canadian ones.
Don't I know why!
Because I'm married.
A new duo will be made.
Sonia and Chamkila.
Yes!
Everyone saw what happened in Chandigarh.
People went crazy for this duo.
People wanted Sonia and Chamkila, not Jinda.
I'll bring the shows.
We will release records too.
Yes!
I've already discussed it with HMV.
That's amazing, sir.
You have done wonders.
What a great move!
This will be a hit pair and go to Canada!
And I'll betray Jinda bhai and take his place.
Of course, I'll definitely do that. You've already planned it all out.
The man who made me what I am today,
who is my mentor--
To hell with your mentor!
Did he ever let you sing after Chandigarh?
He never let you shine.
He is scared of you, you fool.
That you might surpass him.
Your face will be on the record covers.
You will get the credit for your songs!
And listen,
I'll hike your fees.
Sir, I assure you on his behalf.
You take this forward.
What an idiot.
The world is full of fools.
-I'll talk to him. -Go and talk to him.
Amari!
Hey!
Did you chop off your hair?
Did you chop off your hair?
Bastard! You are fooling me with this turban.
Speak up!
Speak up!
-Yes. -You motherfucker!
I'll fuck you up!
I've committed other sins.
I quit the job at the factory.
You quit your job?
So are you with crooks now?
No, with musicians.
I play music.
I work for a singer, Jatinder Jinda.
Since when have you been fooling me?
That's how I earned this.
I was saving it
to give you
the day you catch me.
You come drunk every day.
You never change, do you?
Every day.
You never change.
Keep it, Father.
It's all yours.
I'll get more.
Don't worry, Father, I'll earn a lot.
Only branded liquor now.
What's the matter, dude, what's going on?
What are you looking for? What have you lost?
Lemme search your mother
My father has gone missing
What's the matter, dude, what's going on?
What are you looking for? What have you lost?
Lemme search your mother
My father has gone missing
What's the matter, dude, what's going on?
What are you looking for? What have you lost?
Your mother and my father Have caused a scandal
We have to hide our faces Dying of embarrassment
Your mother and my father Have caused a scandal
We have to hide our faces Dying of embarrassment
With one foot in the grave
Where the hell did my old man go?
What's the matter, dude, what's--
Any mistake?
No. It's your lyrics.
But he has a unique flavor.
And the boy sings so well.
-Let's try it again. -Sure.
I'll come in there.
Who knows how they hit it off?
"How did they hit it off?" Remember your mother used to visit you.
Yes, she did.
But she actually came to see my father.
Nonsense!
-And you know what you used to do? -What?
You'd serve them porridge in the same plate.
That's true.
You'd tell your mother to share it with my father.
How could I have known?
You let them share a plate. Now who knows what they are sharing.
Oh my!
Who knows how they hit it off?
When did the sinners fall in love?
This won't stay under wraps
Where the hell did my old man go?
Slightly to this side.
Lower your hand a bit.
Smile.
Ready.
Raise your hands a little.
We had just come to Ludhiana from Delhi
when, suddenly, we heard it in the market.
My father has gone missing
What's the matter, dude, what's going on?
What are you looking for?
This way.
Lemme search your mother
My father has gone missing
What's the matter, dude, what's going on?
What are you looking for? What have you lost?
Wifey, we used to tell my father
Not to visit relatives often
Bhai?
Look at him. Do you know who he is?
You are playing his song.
This is Chamkila!
Get lost, dude. Talk to me if you wanna buy something.
What a pain!
Are you nuts? Don't you know how to talk to singers?
-You tell me then. -Wanna get slapped?
-Get lost! -Hey!
And that record went on to be a hit!
And I bought two kilos of sweets
and distributed it in the office.
And a singer there said,
"Hey, Tikki, it's Chamkila's album that's a hit."
"What are you celebrating for?"
You walked away feeling shy
Your secrets come undone
The rascal is dead.
In the music of your bangles
Hey, I want to look down feeling shy
My heart yearns
I yearn to squeeze you in my arms
Oh, yes
Oh, yes, my heart yearns
Uncle.
Uncle.
-Look, what happened, Uncle. -Nothing happened!
They are spreading rumors.
It's true, Uncle!
We are here with Boss's body.
I'll kill you, bastard!
Do you know how much people love Chamkila?
Why would they kill him?
Hey, Dhani Ram!
Get up.
Aren't you going for your show?
Look, your buddies are here.
Come on, get up.
-Who's he? -Boss's father.
He's too drunk to think straight.
Are the militants here?
Why did you join the police force if you're so scared?
Go and check now!
It's the police.
Some no-good singer died,
and we've to lose our sleep over it.
A bullet hit Lal's hand but he escaped into the fields.
Harmonium player Harjeet Gill died on the spot.
-And so did the dholak player, Debu. -Bad luck.
Had Tikki not left the group, Debu would have survived.
Who is Tikki?
He used to play dholak for Boss.
And who is this boss? Chamkila?
Yes, sir.
Check who is inside.
-Who is inside? -Boss's father.
-Who else? -There's no one else.
-Then who is he talking to? -Hey.
How long have you been with Chamkila?
About eight years, sir.
Around the time of the fight with Sonia.
What fight?
Sir, please don't think she has anything to do with this.
Are you going to tell the DSP what to think?
Idiot!
He's the DSP.
Don't butter me up so much
that your hand goes up my ass.
Not at all, sir.
Hey, answer him.
What was the fight about?
It was about money.
Tikki took him there to discuss it.
What the hell does he think of himself? I'll set him right today.
You don't have to do anything. Just be there, okay?
I'll talk to him. Come on.
Tikki paaji.
Hey, paaji.
Because Chamkila writes the lyrics,
he composes the music,
he tells the musicians what to play.
But when it comes to money,
everything goes into your pocket.
Isn't that twisted?
Tikki, paaji.
Hold on a minute! I'm talking to him!
Sir, how can you be so greedy
that the wages
and the tips that far exceed the wages,
all end up in your pocket?
Though it's rightfully his.
And Sonia,
she's been singing for you for years.
What does she make in tips?
Ask her.
Why are you letting this idiot speak for you?
Sir, we are comrades, we won't tolerate this.
Shut up!
Move aside!
You, come here.
Talk.
No, actually,
all we want to say is…
if, along with our wages…
we could get a cut…
What if you don't?
If I don't give you a cut,
what will you do?
No, sir, I'm not here to fight.
You
wanna fight?
With me?
Hey you,
motherfucker!
Just because I let you sit with me, you forgot your identity?
What do you think, have you become our equal?
I made you Chamkila!
I did!
And I can squash you whenever I want.
So, keep picking the crumbs I throw your way.
Or you'll starve to death!
What are you staring at?
I won't starve.
I may be Chamar,
but I won't starve to death.
You wanna try it?
-Should I give you a taste? -Yes.
Get out. Get out of here!
Get out of my office!
Out!
SURINDER SONIA
Have you lost your mind?
What did you just do?
I know something for sure, Tikki paaji.
What?
I know what people want to hear. What they enjoy.
And I can give them that.
And right there on the footpath,
Boss started his own troupe.
403331 INDERDEEP CHUCHAKWAL
SURINDER SONIA 403331
JATINDER JINDA 403331
JAGJIT FATAA 403331
AMAR SINGH CHAMKILA 403331
Who squeezed your body?
My heart yearns…
Tha-tha-thana-thana-thana-oh Bro, Jugni
Bro, Jugni says Who chants the name of the Lord
Who chants the name of the Lord
An inquiry for Chamkila.
Chamkila! An inquiry for Chamkila.
Chamkila! There's an inquiry!
Hey, Dhakkan, tell Chamkila there's an inquiry for him.
Hey, Uncle!
Even a touch will dirty you
Chamkila!
A simple touch dirties you
Chamkila!
Chamkila, there's an inquiry for you.
-What? -An inquiry.
Run!
-For me? -Yes.
-Yes, sir? -Chamkila?
I flutter around
Wearing a rainbow-colored tunic
I've quit my foolhardy ways
You quit having affairs
I'm off to fulfill my desires
Why are you being bitter?
With all the raw milk you have
Your boobs look creamy
Some people are here to meet you.
They want you for a show.
Sir, this is Chamkila.
-A show in Moga on the 21st. -Sure, sir.
He started getting a lot of bookings.
And when Kashmiri Lal and Sonia got back from their tour in Rajasthan,
they found their belongings on the road.
And Boss was sitting in his chair.
Sir? Please come in.
"Please come in?"
Did you pay the rent?
Tell me, did you pay the rent?
-Do you know who you are talking to? -I think he's talking to you.
Who are you? Go to the shop!
Chamkila must be really glad.
That's a slap in the face.
No, sir. He was busy elsewhere.
He was in girl trouble.
He needed girls.
I mean, for shows. As a singer.
You know Chamkila's songs are duets.
How would I know?
-Am I a truck driver? -No, sir.
Am I a village bumpkin?
Do you really think he listens to Chamkila's songs?
Only constables do.
Loafers swept me off my feet
Loafers swept me off my feet
Those loafers will rob you
And eat you up
It's not easy to sing with you, Chamkila. You sing high notes.
-I'm out. -But it polishes your singing.
-…loot all the artists! -Want a slap?
-Really? I dare you! -"I dare you!"
-I'll be your worst nightmare! -You don't scare me.
You don't know me--
All our energy is going into finding girls.
-Look for a new one every day! -What can I do?
-Shall I dress up like one? -You were to get someone.
-Well, I will! -Okay, then!
-Okay, then! Okay! -Okay, then! Okay.
Then Mr. Manak said there's a girl who has done some shows with him.
And that was Ms. Babbi.
Who?
Amarjot.
Hello, sir.
-Chamkila? -Yes, that's me.
Are you unmarried?
Please come in.
Do you actually have any shows or are we wasting our time here?
What?
-Meaning? -Do you have shows?
Get that.
Dates next to each show.
Noting the dates don't guarantee shows!
Fantastic!
-I mean, this is quite something! -Okay, all right.
Here's the contract and an advance.
Let's try it out for a month.
If things go well, we'll take it forward.
Well, you listen to me now.
Is Chamkila a new singer?
-Are you some big shot? -It's okay. One month.
Wait a minute, yaar. Why are you sweet-talking them?
And the girl seems so dull.
Who knows if she can even talk?
Then hear her sing.
-Start the music. -There's no need.
There's no need for that. Mr. Manak vouched for her.
It's all right.
I'll charge you more than Manak.
He's a bigger star.
-I see, he's a bigger star-- -Tikki, where's the tea?
Tea, please.
-Kikar, go and order some tea. -We can discuss money.
We'll manage it.
Is that a songbook?
Answer him.
Which book is it?
-White Blood. -What?
-White Blood. -White Blood.
It's a great book.
Okay.
-So this is where you practice. -Have a seat.
What kind of songs do you like?
She sings all kinds of songs.
She sings all day long. God knows what.
I get so bored.
Shall we start?
Yes, of course.
Sa…
Come on, sing.
Sa…
Sa…
Sa Re Ga Pa…
Amazing.
She can sing English songs too.
Yes. Sing something, Babbi.
What's wrong with me? Really?
I'm not taking care of you.
Let's go have some soft drinks.
Let them bore each other. Come on.
-Your name is Pappu, right? -Yes.
-It suits you. -Let's go get some fresh air, veere.
They'll take good care of Pappu. Don't worry.
Shall we start again?
Have you heard any of my songs?
You have.
Which one's on your mind?
Which one? "My Father Has Gone Missing"?
People like such lyrics. You know, like…
"Someone's son kneaded me like dough."
People like it.
Loot and love can never be hidden
Loot and love can never be hidden
A pregnancy can't escape a midwife's eye
I've been disgraced
I've been disgraced
Though I never had an affair
She has a city accent.
We need to change it.
But she sings well.
No more cold water. Don't drink water from clay pots.
No need to be shy of you
You can drink me up
No need to be shy of you
You can drink me up
No need to be shy of you
You can drink me up
No need to be shy of you
You can drink me up
No need to be shy of you
You can drink me up
I can sniff out a girl two miles away
The fan was going off-key.
I wander the streets
Looking for hot chicks
I wander the streets
Looking for--
I can sniff out a girl two miles away
I can sniff out a girl two miles away
I wander the streets Looking for--
Listen to this.
I wander the streets
Looking for hot chicks
Brother-in-law, I'm happily married
But my hubby just loves my fair skin
But my hubby just loves my fair--
Let's take a break.
Tired?
Come later.
Your brother is a drunkard, brother-in-law
I swear, he is a pain to be with
Your brother is a drunkard, brother-in-law
She started singing with him,
and they became a hit pair.
Then they sang a lot of dirty songs together.
And then someone shot them.
Is this the story?
No, sir.
Their first show got canceled.
-Because of militants? -No, a wedding.
None of his shows had ever been canceled.
So someone called Amarjot bad luck.
Babbi heard that.
Good the show got canceled.
We'll be better prepared for the next one. We'll prepare more duets.
No, I want to go home.
Look, this show did get canceled,
but there will be a day, when we'll be turning down shows.
-Why? -What?
Why will we turn them down?
Because we won't be able to do them all.
No, we won't turn them down.
Okay, we won't turn them down.
I promise.
And in our next show, we'll show them what we are. Right?
And then it happened.
They sang a lot of dirty songs,
and they became a hit pair.
What you mentioned earlier, happened now.
Your favorite singers, Amar Singh Chamkila and Ms. Amarjot.
Welcome.
No need to be shy of you
You can drink me up
No need to be shy of you
You can drink me up
My youth is going out of control
Lick me

Bharava.
-Sit. -Scoot over.
You're a scruffy fellow.
-Girls only had eyes for me today. -Yes, of course.
Have you seen yourself?
-Go ahead. -A minute.
It happens every time. I'll give just one rupee.
-Just one rupee. -I'll kick your butt.
One rupee, he says.
Sleep in my arms, sister-in-law I will keep you comfy
I wrote it last night. We'll record it if you like it.
Hey, sleep in my arms, sister-in-law
I will keep you comfy
Sleep in my arms, sister-in-law
I will keep you comfy
He grabs my bed in the middle of the night
Drunk to his bones
With a mouth full of tobacco
His drunken stupor left me dumbstruck
Your brother is a drunkard
Not even a single note more.
It's not loud enough.
Aari, aari, aari
Aari, aari, aari
Mother-in-law says, "Why are you upset?"
I'm worried about you
You're not telling the truth
Nope, you're not telling the truth
You had an affair back home
I swear, I'm telling the truth
I swear, I'm telling the truth
I was the leader of just the girl gang
Who squeezed your body?
Who squeezed your body?
Who did the dirty dance with you?
I'm a dainty chick
I'm a dainty chick
But people think I'm a snob
I'm a dainty chick
Come closer.
Lift your hand a little.
Okay. Smile.
-This one's pretty popular these days. -Chamkila?
-"Darling, I'm Your Sugar"? -Yes.
There's a lot of demand for it in the market.
Some new Panjabi singer. Chamkila.
-Chamkila? -Yes, sir.
Chamkila.
What do you know, my love
What do you know, my love
That I sneak peeks at you
But I am too shy to say it
That I sneak peeks at you
But I am too shy to say it
That one day passionately with my eyes
I want to make love to you
That one day passionately with my eyes
I want to make love to you
What do you know, my love
What do you know, my love
My body's kingdom
My heart's reign
My present being I want to submit to you
What do you know, my love
What do you know, my love
Take this true love to new heights
And keep it safely in a treasure chest
Want to see the joys and sorrows with you
I will keep you tucked away
From everyone's eyes
I will fight the world for you
I will color you like my scarf
To match you with my dress
I will drape you across my chest
I sneak peeks at you
But I am too shy to say it
I sneak peeks at you
But I am too shy to say it
What do you know, my love
What do you know, my love
Thoughts of parting
Oh, love is so exhausting
Let the music of the bodies play
Thoughts of parting
Oh, love is so exhausting
Let the music of the bodies play
What do you know, my love
What do you know, my love
What do you know, my love
Come on, Papa!
Don't "Papa" me!
It's going well with Chamkila. Why should we leave?
-Maybe ask him to pay more. -I've sealed the deal with another singer.
I took a booking amount too.
Go and pack your bags.
But why, Papa?
Because Chamkila is unmarried. Got it?
That's why I said we'll see how it goes for a month.
It's been many months now.
It'll be game over if they fall for each other.
We must get out of here now.
So then?
This was our last show.
This duo is done.
Are you crazy?
We've just started tasting success, and you want to leave now?
Your father is a greedy old geezer!
You're a golden goose for him.
Tell me what to do.
Find a way.
Ask Chamkila to marry me.
What?
-Is there another way? -…another way?
She can't leave her family and move in with you.
She's not that kind of a girl.
We'll make the arrangements, but it must be done today.
-Did anyone see you? -I don't know.
Hurry up.
-Is it done? -Yes, it is.
Smile, please.
Are you happy? You got married, after all.
Dressed in finery
Who told them about this wedding?
I'm out, dressed to kill
They're singing our songs. I'll go give this to them.
With all the raw milk you have Your boobs look creamy
There are seven foreigners
Signing at my home
Who is that guy who got married yesterday?
Here you go.
This isn't enough!
All the rich girls fell for loafers
-Whose song are you singing? -Chamkila!
-Who? -Chamkila!
They will see you.
They don't recognize me.
All the rich girls fell for loafers
All the rich girls fell for loafers All the rich girls fell for loafers
The boys have eyes only for you
The smile on your face can't be hidden
Boys are fighting over you
They're ready to kill for you
What did I get myself into? What do I do now?
Many lovesick Romeos Will now roll at your doorstep
I'm gonna get married come what may
You talk with your eyes
Your features sharp as a knife
You talk with your eyes
Your features sharp as a knife
I flutter around
Wearing a rainbow-colored tunic
I've quit my foolhardy ways
You quit having affairs
I'm off to fulfill my desires
Why are you being bitter?
With all the raw milk you have
Your boobs look creamy
Loafers swept me off my feet
You're a married man now, Amari!
Come out, you fucker!
Let's see how shiny you are!
Hey, Dhaniye, we know you're inside!
Open the door!
Amarjot's father must have sent them. They had to know eventually.
You'll pay the price for what you did!
They are not from Amarjot's family.
Then?
They are Gurmail's bhai.
Who's Gurmail?
My wife.
Remember our first meeting?
I was married even then.
Wedding prayers begin.
So you lied to me?
To me?
So? What's so special about you?
That I stood by you, asshole.
-You could've been honest. -Then you would've been an accomplice.
What good would it do?
I had to marry her.
Was there any other way to save the duo?
Come outside!
Now no one can break this duo.
Bottoms up!
Come on, let's handle them.
Our bhai will be here soon.
You bloody fucker…
You fucking assholes!
Motherfucker!
No matter how successful one is,
even if he touches the sky,
he can't be above the law.
This village council does not accept Chamkila's second marriage.
Did I say it right? Don't worry, Father.
I'm Amitabh Bachchan for the public. Wait and watch.
This marriage is not legal.
It's a crime
and a disgrace for this village.
Dhani Ram,
aka Amar Singh,
aka Chamkila,
present yourself.
It looked like one of his shows.
The entire village was there to see him.
Yes, it didn't feel like a village council.
Look at me.
This is your punishment.
You might be a big shot at home,
here you're just a criminal.
Criminal.
Thank you.
Now watch.
Sir,
today you slapped me in front of everyone.
You demeaned me to show your power.
First, I pay my respects to you.
And then he started a dramatic speech.
He used to act in plays as a child.
And then to my uncles and my family here.
We got a chance to see him perform that day.
I completely agree with the Village Head.
-What? -Yes.
Law is above everyone.
And only religion is above the law.
-Isn't that true, sir? -Yes, of course.
Following those religious practices, with the Lord in my heart,
I married Amarjot Kaur.
And once you say your vows,
I can't unsay them, can I?
Shut up!
Is this funny to you?
But…
I'll give 5,000 rupees
to Gurmail Kaur every month.
Well done!
This is to ensure that my second marriage
doesn't leave my first wife in peril.
Wow! He's such a great guy.
But is money enough to live one's life?
Never. I say it's not enough.
That's why I will give an imported cow to Gurmail!
-Amazing! -No…
A cow?
That's not enough. A cow?
An Australian cow. The first one in that district.
I'll give 5,000 rupees every month.
How can a man have two wives?
Why not?
Anything is possible.
Thousands have done the same.
You are sold out to Chamkila.
Here everyone is sold out to landowners.
Who protects us?
Dhaniya does!
He took care of the wedding expenses of many girls from this village.
Chamkila gifted eight canisters of ghee, four sets of clothes, and 2,000 rupees
to each of my daughters on their weddings.
Great.
Chamkila had already bought witnesses.
Tell me, Babbi,
if you knew I was already married,
would you have married me?
No!
Never!
Then?
I had to hide it.
I couldn't afford to lose you.
Look, Babbi,
I come from a filthy place.
I can't go back.
And you?
The place you've come from,
will you go back there?
Why pretend with each other?
We wanted to be together. Right?
We are together now.
Amarjot
and Chamkila.
Pull me closer…
No dates, bhai.
There are only 30 days in a month.
How can I give you a booking?
My son bought a huge car!
I yearn to put my arms around you
I yearn to put my arms around you
Even your father wouldn't have seen that big a car.
He creates a scene every other day.
He was sloshed. Won't do it again.
He absolutely will.
No, I promise. He won't.
New money has gone to his head.
No.
Look, how he talks.
To begin with, please accept
Pirthipal Singh Dhakkan's heartfelt greetings.
To begin with, I request my fans who want to reward…
Why didn't you tell me he was already married?
I didn't know either!
-He told me a lie. -What lie?
-That he is unmarried. -Did he say, "Tikki, I am unmarried"?
-Did he? -No, he didn't say that but--
Don't talk to me.
-Why are you snapping at me? -Who else should I snap at?
Tell me, who else?
My heart yearns…
You're going offbeat, Tikki.
I yearn to put my arms around you…
Sir, even today, marquee chaps don't get renters
if they don't have Chamkila's records.
-Really? -Yes, sir.
His records are circulated in many parties.
-Hmm? -Yeah.
Here.
I yearn to squeeze you in my arms
No one in your family would have seen such money.
My darling son Chamkila.
Hey, Chamkila!
You are second to none!
You are number one.
Cheeky fellow, you must say this to every artist.
Other artists are great,
but you are our own, Chamkila!
Eighty-four.
Everyone knows what happened
in Panjab thereafter.
In the village bordering Barnala…
Twenty-four people were killed in the stampede.
About 115 were critically injured.
…dead bodies lying untended.
The police have found…
Boys are disappearing from their homes.
No one dares to step outside.
Everything is on fire,
shooting is rampant.
In this time, who'll come to our shows?
And who'll organize them?
There are orders
banning these shows.
Amidst a shortage of food and medicines,
we felt no one's going to buy records.
What will become of artists?
It was just the opposite in the case of Boss.
-The roof is dark-hued -Yeah!
-Showering sunlight -Yeah!
This golden land
With golden fringes swaying
Both the loves were killed by love
Lovingly, lovingly, lovingly
Hey, lovingly, lovingly, lovingly
Understand the pulse of your business.
In crisis,
people crave more entertainment.
Love is a destroyer
Oh, my love is a destroyer
Love is a destroyer
Oh, my love is a creator
Love is a destroyer
Oh, my love is a creator
He paid me back in full
My lover paid me back in full
Surrounded by danger,
and never-ending pain,
people don't want sad songs.
Their lives are tragic enough.
They want an energetic number
to lift their spirits.
They want an escape for a few moments.
Long live the fire within me
Let it burn and create new life
I emerge from fire bright and shining
My spirit will shine through
My spirit
My spirit
My spirit
I am lovesick
I am lovesick
I am suffering
I am yearning
Love is a destroyer
Oh, my love is a creator
Love is a destroyer
Oh, my love is a creator
Keep grooving
Whatever will be, will be
Long live the fire within me
Let it burn and create new life
I can do it, Mr. Ahmed.
If not me, who will entertain them?
This is my job.
My lover paid me back in full
I am Panjab
I am Panjab
I am Panjab I am Panjab
I am Panjab
I will sing and dance every day
Oh, I will sing and dance every day
I have taken out all my toys
Oh, I have taken out all my toys
Colors of the world fade compared to me
My blood anoints me
Why should I be scared?
I am strong-footed
I trust my strength
Here I fly
We have a new scheme for you.
When buying a Chamkila record,
you must buy one of another artist too.
We'd heard "Buy one, get one free,"
but never "Buy one and another is compulsory."
Love is a destroyer
Oh, Love is a creator
I am Panjab
I am Panjab
The jerk is laughing at us.
Isn't this an insult to Panjab?
An insult?
People are dying here, and what sort of records is Chamkila releasing?
Brother-in-Law, Check Out My Booty?
The shit is selling like hot cakes.
I wonder how the Committee will take it.
Committee?
There are godmen on the roads
carrying religious flags.
And most of them are fake.
-Hiding guns under their shawls. -So?
They won't like Chamkila's vulgar songs.
Brother-in-law, check out my booty
All of us sing such songs.
But they aren't selling.
Whose songs are selling?
Fucker is doing two shows a day,
just so we don't get any.
Chamkila is a big name.
If something
brings this name into the limelight,
people will pay attention.
Word will spread like wildfire.
Finally.
The Chamkila.
The Elvis of Panjab, UK, US, Canada.
Yes.
Please come, have a seat. Let's start.
Could you both wait outside?
-I'd like to speak with him in private. -Why?
So we can talk freely.
I have some personal questions too.
Nothing personal, please.
Nope.
Please sit.
Mr. Chamkila, why are you so jittery?
You are looking everywhere but at me.
Please tell me. I want to know.
Well, you're wearing pants.
Excuse me?
Your jeans.
So?
Chamkila,
known worldwide for his vulgar songs.
Who portrays women in a cheap way, who objectifies them.
What's that?
Lemme search your mother My father has gone missing
I was taking a bath at noon And he was peeping
Kneaded you like dough
You write such lyrics, but you have a problem with my pants?
That's what I have seen, madam.
That's what I've heard.
But I haven't seen many girls in pants.
Brilliant excuse.
Because you've seen this, your lyrics are justified?
All that bullshit in your songs is okay?
Is that what you mean?
Speak up. Have you lost your tongue?
Madam, not everyone can afford to think about right and wrong.
At least, I can't.
People like me have to survive somehow.
I can't take chances.
You won't understand, but I am just an ordinary man.
I have to cater to my audience.
Or I'll be finished.
How can you be finished?
People love your songs.
This says, "Highest selling artist of Panjab."
And you can't get your head around it.
Let me explain.
Most of the people in this world are ordinary. Like me.
There are few like you.
And this is what ordinary people like.
Because this is what they see.
That's why my songs work.
That's why you are interviewing me.
If I were like you, you wouldn't be here.
The lady took such offense…
She spewed such venom that several others followed.
"Chamkila sings sleazy songs."
"He's misleading the people of Panjab."
"He's corrupting the society."
All true.
Not an iota of lie.
Before I start, I want to say something.
-We don't sing vulgar songs. -The atmosphere is bad enough.
We don't want to add to it with dirty songs.
Everyone is after us.
So-called friends.
It's their love, you know.
-Watch your step. -It's all a joke to you.
As long as the audience is with us,
no one can touch us.
You're going there to rest.
Don't fret about this.
They won't play Amar Singh Chamkila's songs anymore.
-Does Babbi sing such songs too? -Well, she's married to Chamkila.
Marrying Chamkila doesn't mean she should sing such lyrics.
I wonder how men fantasize about you.
My mother-in-law says, "You must be like your sister."
"Your entire family is the same."
And you just watch it?
Why don't you stop her?
Your family's reputation is being tarnished.
…inform the audience they won't be able to hear Chamkila's songs anymore.
What kind of a man are you?
Who makes his wife sing such songs?
Don't you care about her honor?
First, you tricked her into marriage. Lied to her.
And for what? To disgrace her publicly?
Is this a joke to you?
I've seen these squabbles all my life.
Now it's my turn.
Come on, Babbi.
We have a show to do.
First, you must promise that she won't sing dirty lyrics.
Or she won't go.
She has made up her mind.
Four thousand five hundred rupees.
For one show.
No artist has been paid so much.
But we have.
Our records are being sold in black. Like the tickets for Amitabh Bachchan's movies.
How does that matter?
Babbi, this is our time.
And trust me,
it will be over before you know it.
Then we'll think about the rights and wrongs.
But come with me now.
The audience must be waiting.
Come on.
Let's go.
And she got up.
Then they started singing dirty duets again.
Yes, sir.
And it's a matter of pride.
This is our job, sir.
To corrupt the society.
That's your job?
First, corrupt your wife with your own filth.
Then disgrace the society together.
Sir, you say Chamkila is dirty because he sings dirty songs.
Hey, sit down.
So what?
So tell me, who listens to his songs?
Filthy and dirty people.
They listen to his songs.
But Chamkila is the superstar of Panjab.
Most listen to his songs.
Do you mean to say
that most people are filthy?
-Hey! -Yes, they are.
Most of the people in this world are filthy and dirty.
Most people like trash.
What should we do?
Give it to them?
"We"?
Who's "we"?
Who decides what should people listen to?
You wanna fight with the Police? Do you?
Back off before you disappear off the face of the earth.
Hey! Back off. Let him go.
Kid, I've been part of comrade plays in college too.
But those rules don't work here.
Wait a few years.
All your questions will be answered.
Papa.
Babbi has married a one of a kind guy.
Such a dirty mind! He writes such nonsense about women. Gross.
How can he come up with such things?
Is he insane?
All men think about it all the time, darling.
They don't say it out loud and he does.
How do you know?
Granny, do you listen to his songs?
Yes, discreetly.
Many things are done discreetly. Right?
The songs we sing at weddings, discreetly.
They're no different.
Hey, lover of the dainty lass Tell us about your last night
Girl, jump over the wall
Using the might of your thighs
He's your son, but he looks like me
Hey you, walking on the road
He's your son, but he looks like me
Hey you, walking on the road
Let the snake slither between the thighs
Let the snake slither between the thighs
Shame, shame, shame, shame
Red, red, red, red with shame
Heart, o my heart
Heart, o my heart
Soft at heart, soft at heart
Passionate body but soft at heart
Soft at heart, soft at heart
Passionate body but soft at heart
My womanliness is yours
My womanliness is yours
You own me
You own me
This is my upbringing
I am a wild, crazy, poor lass
Honey, go bam-bam in the ham
I am a wild, crazy, poor lass
Honey, go bam-bam in the ham
You plunder my body
Thinking I'm weak and you're macho
But really
You're just a means of pleasure to me
Lemme go bang-bang
Lemme go bang-bang
Lemme go bang-bang, slam-bam
Honey, go bam-bam in the ham
Lemme go bang-bang, slam-bam
Honey, go bam-bam in the ham
Mother to my daughter
Daddy's doll
Sister-in-law to my brother-in-law
Says the world to me
Sister-in-law to my brother-in-law
I accept these ties
But I don't forget
How to douse these blazing desires
Of my burning body
Don't think that only you have desires
Secretly, my desires are more than yours
Chamkila sings in my heart too
Oh, God, this sweetness is gonna kill me!
Lemme go bang-bang
Lemme go bang-bang
Lemme go bang-bang, slam-bam
Honey, go bam-bam in the ham
Lemme go bang-bang, slam-bam
Honey, go bam-bam in the ham
Hey, with your tiny saw
How will you chop a jungle?
You are just a one-night wonder
I'm a double-edged sword
I am not a damsel in distress
Let my turn come
You plunder my body
Thinking I'm weak and you're macho
But really
You're just a means of pleasure to me
My heart full of desires
My passionate body
My brazen ways
Oh, hey
Lemme go bang-bang, slam-bam
Honey, go bam-bam in the ham
Lemme go bang-bang, slam-bam
Honey, go bam-bam in the ham
Hey, you roof-breaker!
THE ROOF-BREAKER
I don't get it.
If you don't get it, we are dead.
Hello.
What's wrong, bhai?
We got some threats.
From the Force groups.
-Letters from two groups in one day. -Who dropped them here?
I found them outside the door this morning.
But what do they say?
Don't sing dirty songs.
Or we'll kill you.
But people want to hear them.
That's why they come to our shows. Buy our records.
Do we like singing dirty songs?
What the hell.
What else can we do?
I think this is our friends' doing.
These letters could be fake.
Anyway, they wouldn't just kill us.
-Where are they? -In there.
Hey, you.
Who is he?
Sivia, a friend of the boss.
He had friends like him too?
He is the one.
He must have delivered the letters.
He is from the Force.
Good that he didn't see Chamkila.
But how long can I hide?
We are safe.
He ran away?
-Yes? -Swaran Singh Sivia.
I am from the Income Tax Department. There's a notice for you.
Mentioned some "department."
"Department"? Did you hear this word?
-Yes. He gave them a letter too. -A letter?
When I saw him for the first time,
he looked like Amitabh Bachchan.
Hello! Hello.
-I am Chamkila. -Okay.
-How are you? All good? -Yes.
May I get you something? Tea, soft drink, something?
-No. -Paaji.
I am in trouble.
I need your help.
Please don't say no, paaji.
Babbi.
Give us a minute.
Here, here. Come to me, my son.
Please, have a seat.
These letters seem genuine.
These are real threats.
Take it all.
-And forgive me. -What are you doing?
Paaji, I won't corrupt the society.
I won't mislead anyone.
Please let the department know.
Who do you think I am?
You are from the department.
My boy overheard you.
I am from the Income Tax Department.
-Do you pay taxes on this? -Take it all.
Just spare me, paaji.
We're on the lookout for people like you.
Why look for me?
I'm right here.
Do you pay income tax?
-What? -Income tax? Do you pay it?
What's that?
I told him to put the money away and close the safe.
Then I got in touch with my contacts.
Arranged a meeting for Chamkila.
-Chamkila. -Greetings.
You roar like a lion.
God has blessed you.
-Do not sing frivolous songs. -I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.
Please forgive me.
You want me to forgive you?
-I'm a human being just like you. -Sir--
Only God can forgive.
-Ask Him. -Yes, sir.
There's something else.
Speak up.
A record of mine is already with the company.
Due to be released soon.
That's not in my hands.
Okay.
Don't compose such songs after that.
I repent.
I promise,
I will not write such songs anymore.
Come here.
Be happy.
I made a decision.
I'll make devotional records.
You are still in shock.
Pull yourself together.
I can make them. Trust me.
Cry your heart out, son. Time is a great healer.
What the hell!
It's a crime to even say "devotional" and "Chamkila" in the same breath.
Get that?
You could be fined or even jailed.
What is this? Stop that.
"Chant the Almighty's Name" is Chamkila's song?
I thought it was his voice.
But then I dismissed the thought.
"I'm the Sword of the Crested One," "Oh, Son, While Going…"
Till now, all his albums were the biggest hits in Panjab.
But his first devotional album, "Chant the Almighty's Name"
broke all his previous records.
Oh, my lowly life
Chant the Almighty's name
His devotional albums were also being sold in the black market at triple the price.
It will help you in difficult times
Have you heard "Baba Your Nankana"?
I wrote that.
The tyrants crossed all limits
Of oppression and tyranny
Brothers became thirsty
For each other's blood
The British played mischief
And what a tragedy has come to pass
Your Nankana has been snatched from us
Your Nankana has been snatched from us
Send all the remaining copies of all the records to Moga.
Devotional, non-devotional, anything will do.
-As long as they are… -…Chamkila's records.
All good now?
No one is out to kill us now.
Okay?
It's in progress.
Don't worry.
Just fix a drink, man.
Don't you trust me?
Chamkila is telling the truth
Hey, dear Sivia
Your Nankana has been snatched from us
Now, "I'm the Sword of the Crested One."
Enough of this, yaar.
Now sing one of your old songs, Chamkila.
Yes, man. Please sing one.
Bhai, sing "What's the Matter, Dude, What's Going On?"
Yes, sing that one.
I used to sing these songs.
Lemme search your mother My father has gone missing
But I don't sing them anymore.
And here's a brand-new song.
Give it a listen. You will enjoy it.
Come on, yaar.
It's a wedding.
We aren't here to mourn.
Please listen to this. It's different. You'll like it.
Yaar, sing the real songs.
Sing "Will Take the Lid off the Pot."
These are the requests I'm getting from you.
"I Was Bathing at Noon."
I used to sing this song.
Then I was told that I am evil, I sing frivolous songs, and to stop that.
That it's wrong.
So I don't sing these songs anymore.
Come on, man!
Chamkila had a major flaw.
He was a slave to his audience.
Despite his success, he remained servile.
He could never say no in a show.
Your elder brother
My bachelor brother-in-law
Was peeping at me through a hole
Your elder brother
My bachelor brother-in-law
Was peeping at me through a hole
As I lathered myself up
He ogled as I took a bath at noon
If you were a real man's daughter
You would have taken an axe
Bhai, leave your tips here and sit down.
Is this the first show you're watching?
You are spoiling your own show.
Take a seat, bhai. Make him sit down.
If you were a real man's daughter
You are making a mistake, Chamkila!
A big mistake!
Stop singing such vulgar songs!
Or you will regret it.
Those were bad times, and Chamkila was walking on the razor's edge.
The audience wanted frivolous songs.
But he was also being watched closely.
Is that Chamkila?
Seems like it.
Bhatti sir.
Greetings.
Greetings.
-Dhani Ram? -Yes, sir.
I hear a new album of yours was released yesterday.
What's the title?
Baba, Your Nankana, sir.
How do you know these militants?
Why do you make songs for them?
You find that funny?
Bhatti sir, may we sit?
Stand right there!
Listen.
I've summoned you here for a warning.
Stop getting cozy with the militants.
Or you will be wiped out.
-That's strange. -What?
Both of you are singing the same tune.
You know what, sir?
Decide among yourselves who is going to wipe me out.
And just do it.
Son, just give us one reason,
and your wish will be fulfilled.
And save the drama for your shows.
Got it?
Remember what I have said.
Now get out.
Greetings.
Thank you.
Sir!
A…
A film producer came by.
He wants to shoot a scene from one of your shows.
For a film called Patola.
I told him we don't have the time even for recordings.
-And sent him on his way. -Do you have his number?
-And sent him on his way. -Do you have his number? Yes, I do.
Call him over.
I've always wanted to see myself
on the silver screen.
Since I was a kid.
I wanted to be a hero.
Really? Me too.
You too?
That's what all Panjabis want.
-We'll have the bar here, chairs here. -We don't drink much.
Yeah, but we are Panjabis.
The table over here.
Open the gate. Call Chamkila.
-What is it? -Nothing.
Move.
-Chamkila. -Hello, paaji.
You are the best.
We are your fans.
-We listen to your songs all the time. -Yes, that's true.
"Baba Your Nankana"?
No, paaji.
We listen to those,
Lift It, Driver, Driver.
You pour the heart out.
Your songs showcase our thoughts.
What brings you here?
The thing is,
you sing very dirty songs in your shows, Chamkila.
-All right. -All right?
What is right about it?
It's all wrong.
And this won't be tolerated.
-So, what do you want to do? -What should I do?
Should I shoot you?
Should I?
Should we shoot or is there another way?
One more thing.
Don't tell anyone.
Or others will want a share too.
Don't worry, Chamkila paaji.
We told you, we are your fans.
Diehard fans.
Thank you.
Nothing to worry about.
Everything's fine.
I think it is something to worry about.
Then, let's worry.
Okay, let's worry today.
That's how this world works, Babbi.
Here, your fans threaten you with guns.
Unbelievable! What a place!
But we owe everything to the same world.
What was I?
Where was I?
And where am I now?
If we still call the world a bad place,
that would be unfair.
We have no right to be upset, Babbi.
No right.
You are not listening to me.
This is important.
Listen to me, gorgeous
Listen to me, darling
Listen to me, darling
I am going to tell you the ways of love
Wanna worry or compose a song?
Listen to me, darling
Listen to me, darling
I am going to tell you the ways of love
I am going to tell you the ways of love
Under the stars
We will share stories
Under the stars
We will share stories
Go on, keep it
Keep your hand on my heart
Go on, keep it
Put your hand on my heart
Listen to me, darling
I am going to tell you the ways of love
They believe Chamkila should know the decorum of an artist.
He has no right to defame our women.
This is my last night in Bahrain.
God willing, I will visit you every six months or a year.
A simple touch dirties you
A simple touch dirties you
Your blush-pink complexion glows
Seeing your beautiful face
The moon hides away in the clouds
Lick me, hey, lick me
Scoop me up and lick me
Darling, I'm your sugar
Dedicate your life to me
Success too comes at a price.
After Bahrain,
Chamkila didn't take Tikki to Canada.
Perhaps he had figured out Tikki's intentions.
…you left me behind!
That I might run away tearing my passport.
Motherfucker, you turned out to be just like Jinda.
-They never worked together again. -I curse you from the bottom of my heart.
Die, Chamkila!
Die, motherfucker!
Listen to me, darling
I am going to tell you the ways of love
Listen to me, darling
I am going to tell you the ways of love
Under the stars
We will share stories
I will keep you like an amulet
Listen to me, gorgeous
My! The gestures of your eyes
Your killer smile bit me like a snake
You have slain me
Listen to me, gorgeous
You have slain me
Greetings.
Welcome, sir.
Picture, please!
You can lower your hands.
Look there, Babbi.
Amitabh Bachchan.
Is Amitabh Bachchan here?
We organized a show for Amit sir too.
Really?
Can we meet him?
He's already gone.
Where?
He's already gone from Canada.
But the venue for your show today
was where Amit sir also performed.
That's where we are going.
Spoiled brat
The pure man belongs to God, victory belongs to God.
Please forgive us for any mistakes.
Bumper!
For Amit sir's show,
I had to get an extra 137 seats in the hall.
Very nice!
And for your show today,
do you know how many extra seats we had to get?
One thousand twenty-four!
One thousand twenty-four, sir!
It was fantastic!
I have never added so many extra seats for a show.
Amazing!
People are right when they say, artists are weird.
This was good news,
but Chamkila was upset.
As if he had lost something.
As if his childhood had come to an end.
Though back then, we had plenty to be upset about.
There is nothing above religion.
Not even this life.
Right, sir.
And your dirty, vulgar songs
are against our religion.
We can't tolerate an insult to our religion, can we?
Paaji, can you please hurry it up?
What?
Boy, we are warning you!
Okay, but make it quick.
The audience is waiting.
Hey, do you understand
what we're trying to tell you?
Of course I do.
-We are really serious. -So am I.
But let's wrap this up quickly.
Tell them I'll be there soon. Go on.
Would you like to watch it?
-Come. -What happened?
Nothing.
"First Shout," fourth note.
First shout, and I got scared
You must know why you are here.
Because of my songs.
First, you must understand
that we're not the ones who were warning you till now.
We won't warn you.
We will do what needs to be done.
Today, you will make four promises.
In front of us.
And you will be true to them for life.
Second,
do not think
that you will escape us by returning to India.
You may flee wherever you like,
we will be there.
First promise.
From this very moment,
you will stop singing vulgar songs.
Am I the only one who sings such songs?
What about others?
Almost all artists of Panjab sing such songs.
More vulgar than mine.
But only I'm censured every time.
Why?
Because those artists are conspiring against me.
They want me out of their way.
Can't you see that?
I had promised I won't compose frivolous songs.
Since then I haven't composed any.
But you sang them.
Even after promising.
People demand them. What do I do?
They insist on it in the shows.
You will not sing such songs.
That's certain.
If it's so difficult, quit singing.
Find another job.
Remember, we are protectors of society,
not religion.
We won't let you besmirch the society.
We will make an example out of you for Panjab's youth.
First promise.
You will not sing such songs.
Second promise.
You will not drink.
Third.
You will not eat meat.
Apparently, you are fond of smoking.
So your final promise,
you will not touch tobacco from today.
As soon as the car door was closed, I saw…
What are you doing?
They forbade it so much that I'm craving it.
-Keep it in! -Let it be.
I realized that he had lost it.
That he feared nothing.
He was a dead man.
Dhakkan was an old friend of Chamkila.
From the days of his struggle.
That day, he quit working for Chamkila.
Others in the group were scared too.
The situation in Panjab worsened.
CHAMKILA IS POISONING THE SOCIETY
They turned people against Chamkila.
PUBLIC FURY AGAINST CHAMKILA'S SONGS SHAMELESS
Chamkila says he fears no one.
He's tarnishing the image of our religion.
We must teach him a lesson.
-This is the right opportunity. -He wants to die.
-The time has come. -What can we do?
Shoot! Kill the bastard!
Sivia ji,
someone fired shots at Boss's car.
Today it was the car, tomorrow it could be Chamkila.
Why didn't you warn him
against returning to Panjab?
It's just a matter of few days. Stay away from Panjab for few days.
Everything will be fine. The public has a short memory.
Yes. Right. I agree.
Man, I'm relieved that you understand the issue.
I know that people will forget soon.
Another Chamkila will be born in Panjab.
Another Chamkila?
Is it so easy?
It's very difficult, paaji.
I have worked very hard.
Chamkila, no one can replace you.
Remember that.
Okay?
Jinda must have thought the same,
here in Canada.
Listen!
You tell me, has any Panjabi artist sold as many records
as each of your albums?
And that's a bad thing too.
Because people are jealous of you.
And someone may take advantage of it now.
With the threat looming large,
someone may hire a contract killer
to settle scores with you.
Don't you get it?
All you have to do is stay away from shows for a while. What's the big deal?
"What's the big deal?"
This is my entire life.
No big deal.
Chamkila, wait, bhai.
Just wait for a while.
I can't.
I can't wait.
Why not?
Look, it's a bad time.
Let this pass.
This is a bad time?
This is the time.
Chamkila has an audience now.
This is my chance.
Do you want to die? Don't you want to live?
Is that in my hands?
Do you think it'll change my destiny?
If I'm destined to die of a gunshot,
that's what will happen.
That bullet will hit me.
How do I make you understand?
Sivia paaji, you are very intelligent.
And I'm ignorant.
But I have seen the world.
It doesn't run on reason.
It just runs.
We have to keep up with it.
There's no need to understand anything.
You are trapped with me.
You'll be done for too.
You have a child.
Another is on the way.
You can stay back.
And then?
You will live.
And after that?
They are shooters.
Their job is to shoot.
So, they will shoot.
We are singers.
Our job is to sing.
So, we will sing.
They won't stop for us.
And we won't for them.
We will perform till our last breath.
Better to live on after death
than live lifelessly.
Embrace the light of love
Embrace it completely
Parched are the lips of fate
And of the imprisoned monk in me
Open the locks inside me
Let me embrace the drunkenness
Embrace the light of love
Embrace it completely
Oh, Bulleh Shah
What they do is up to them
Let me perform my duty fully
Let me bring back the upset ones
Let us lament and get done
Embrace the light of love
Oh, Bulleh Shah
What they do is up to them
Let me perform my duty fully
Let me bring back the upset ones
Greenery of this town
Greenery of this town
May this land prosper
If you are not mine
Who can make me smile?
Embrace the light of love
Embrace it completely…
Slow down, Dhaniye.
This greed will take you down.
Don't worry too much, Uncle.
It will give you an ulcer.
Give him a drink, Uncle.
Tikki!
Embrace the light of love
Embrace the light of love
Embrace the light of love
Did I pinch your turnips?
I am accused of theft
Did I pinch your turnips?
I am accused of theft
Girls do not lose anything
Bachelors reap benefits
Girls do not lose anything
Bachelors reap benefits
Did I bite you?
Did I bite you
That you sit trembling with fear?
A glimpse of you trips me out
Trips me out
-Where to? -It's for the band.
-We can postpone it. -That's why I said we will talk later.
It's not even been a month since you had the baby.
It's not that. It is difficult to do two shows a day at such high notes.
Give me a roti.
Let's get it over with.
Look, it's cold.
Do I eat cold rotis now?
Do you know who I am?
He is Chamkila.
Cold rotis for Chamkila?
Has it come to this?
Hey!
Just kidding. Give me a roti.
Don't be angry, bhai. Give it to me.
-I'll get a hot one. -No. This is fine.
Come on. Let me show you something.
It has my name on it.
Chamkila.
Right?
Is the stopover at Faridkot or Jamalpur?
And shall we get Ripu home?
We will think about it after the show.
They are right over there!
Come on. Let's go.
Someone is going to finish studying too.
Do you have an exam?
…Bhai Amar Singh Chamkila
will be in front of you!
Keep applauding, guys!
The car doors have opened!
-In a few moments… -Shall we?
Bhai Amar Singh Chamkila will be in front of you!
Keep that energy going!
Keep applauding!
Keep applauding--
Oh, my Babbo!
Did anyone go into the room?
What is this, veer ji?
What happened?
Calm down, sister.
It's all over, veer ji.
And whatever's left,
will be taken by these people.
-Stop it. -No, it's not like that at all.
Of course it is!
They are petty!
Their daughter is lying dead here,
what are they doing in there?
They're collecting all the money and gold.
They know, they are not going to get anything from now.
What are you yapping about?
They won't leave even a bone.
-Have you lost it? -I said nothing wrong!
Do you know the nonsense…
A minute.
Enough.
Sir?
Shall we?
CHAMKILA AND AMARJOT
Bid me farewell
Bid me farewell
Now bid me farewell, my friend
Bid me farewell
Bid me farewell
I have to travel beyond
All of you are pure and righteous
I am the impure one
All of you are pure
I am an ocean of sins
Bid me farewell
Bid me farewell
Now bid me farewell, my friend
Today at the Police Headquarters,
addressing the press…
The Chamkila murder case file is closed.
We have other work. Can't pursue a mere singer's case.
A singer? Is Chamkila just a singer?
Do you know how many people get killed daily in Panjab?
-Do you know who Chamkila was? -Madam, step back.
What he was to his audience?
I know very well who Chamkila was.
The type of songs he made.
And what you guys wrote about him.
Don't make me open my mouth. Why would you tell lies?
Why would you tell lies?
You speak the truth
The world where you live
Is not for me
I wanted to be with you longer
I really wanted to
But all the evil here
Was because of me
Bid me farewell
Bid me farewell
Now bid me farewell, my friend
-Greetings, mother. -God bless you, son.
What are you doing?
Homework.
Listen to it if you want to.
Chamkila.
First shout, and I got scared
Second shout, and I ran inside
Third shout, he called my name
And fell straight at the doorstep
Drunk loafers are loafing
First job, to create animosity
Second, to keep opening bottles
Third, to invite trouble
Let anyone come at your doorstep
This Jat shouts at your doorstep
I created Chamkila.
If not for me, he'd still be knitting socks.
I stopped hanging out with girls
Stopped wearing makeup
I stopped hanging out with girls
Stopped wearing makeup
Keeps roaming about the whole day In my street
This wretched loafer
Kisses a scarf and throws it at me
This wretched loafer
I became a loafer in your love
Look at this body through your window
I became a loafer in your love
Look at this body through your window
My bones are now soaked in alcohol
I've become an addict
Intoxication has consumed my alluring body
Intoxication has…
Slow down! You're gonna kill us!
Drive!
What if the head office sends me to New York?
-I want to go to California. -You'll grit your teeth and get over it.
Los Angeles, in flip-flops to the office, straight from the beach.
Slow down, we still have an hour.
See, we're 45 minutes ahead of time. KISS, KISS
That's gonna be the greatest deal of this company ever, if you wrap it up.
If?
Well, the Japanese need to sign it.
This is just a formality. They'll sign it and I'll be the king of the world.
Remember that my parents are coming by this weekend?
That's perfect.
I'll paint the town red with the guys. Won't be bothering you.
But they want to meet you.
-What do I tell them? -What do you mean?
"It's a pleasure to meet you, I shag your daughter."
Madzia, it's cool between us, sex is great and all that…
but we made no promises.
-Hi! -Welcome, welcome.
So that's the million bucks' worth concept?
You went up quickly, didn't you? They're really gonna make you a global. Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Once you're the boss for Poland, remember your old mates, okay?
Tomek!
Chill, all's going well.
I forgot my mobile. I'll be right back.
I'm coming.
I can't wait, too.
I'll call you back, all right?
Jesus Christ! Oranges!
I'm awfully sorry.
Pick them up and later I'll add Jell-O Fix and it's yummy.
-You also add Jell-O Fix? -Always. -Excuse me! -No problem.
-Excuse me! -No problem.
What?
God, Kasia, they're here.
-The Japanese? -Yup.
How come? Half an hour ahead of time?
-Do something, where the hell is Tomek?! -I'm calling.
We are honored. Thank you for the invitation.
Beautiful day!
It's only just started.
I know it's gonna be beautiful anyway.
Are you a fortune teller?
Exactly! Give me your hand!
Come on, I'll read your palm.
This is the most important day in your life.
-And in mine, too. -Really?
Sure, we surely met for a reason. This is destiny.
In a moment I'm going to sign the contract of my life.
Congratulations. And I'll make three of your wishes come true.
-Oh, so now I have three wishes? -Yup.
So… disappear the way you came up.
No, stop it, don't waste your wishes like that.
-In this case I'd like… -No, wait, I'll tell you.
Wish a hundred more wishes.
You'll make them come true? It's legit?
-Yeah! -In this case, I'd like…
you to have a ticket.
Good morning.
Water, perhaps?
I'll find it, please continue your round.
Surprising, how rarely fare dodgers explain the lack of ticket
based on the dichotomy paradox…
Say, Zeno of Elea would prove the movement doesn't exist.
Ergo, the bus ain't moving, ergo, what's the fare for?
Here's where the shoe pinches. Got any ID?
Cheers!
We don't often use force, but would anything else work with you?
Gents, I've got an urgent meeting. I must answer that.
Good.
Sorry, this man is not coming. He doesn't give a fuck.
-No more trouble. -Are you fucked up?
-No more trouble. -Are you fucked up? -But why? -Let me go, you rag!
-But why? -Let me go, you rag!
-You won't believe it. -I won't believe it.
I wouldn't believe it myself.
I don't give a shit if aliens abducted you,
an elderly nymphomaniac or scouts.
I wish they'd killed you.
Come on, you don't want me to work for another company.
-Out! -They're waiting…
Get out of here!
Before I scratch your eyes out!
Need a ride?
Madzia, thanks!
Chillax, the sooner you move out, the better.
What about your parents?
Yeah! Hey!
-Is that how you say hello? -I thought you were dead.
-Look at that sharp tongue. -We haven't spoken for ages.
Come on, bro, let me in, we won't be talking in the hall.
-You came to say good-bye? -Nice interior.
-Are you going somewhere? -Nope, just wanted to see you.
Look me in the eye and say that again.
-Listen, you won't believe it. -No, I won't believe it.
-But you'll be happy. -Oh yeah?
I lost my job, I lost my flat, I lost my car. Everything.
Great, why should I care. Rent something.
I'm totally broke.
What do you mean? You? You were raking it in!
Do you know the costs of living in this city?
Oh yes, I do.
I mean living like civilized people do.
So my hole is no good for you? Sir?
I dunno what you're looking for.
This is just an ordinary small flat.
Goodbye.
Take it easy, chill.
Please, just one night.
Couch.
The couch is fine.
So, you wanna go out?
-I got work to do. -Come on, work will be here tomorrow.
Oh look, your work won't.
Come on, you need to wind down.
We'll get hammered, pick up some honeys.
I don't have such needs.
Fine.
But could you do me a favor?
I knew it, give him an inch and he'll take a mile.
Oh, it's just a small request.
Break into the city monitoring system, please, and find
the record from Domaniewska street in the morning.
I met this totally hot chick there.
But I'm not going to help you satisfy your basic instincts.
I'm not breaking in anywhere.
But this could be the special one.
I'm sure she is. I've heard it so many times.
I'm a collector.
Women are like flowers, blooming when I look at them and touch them.
And flowers, my dear, never look better than in a bouquet.
But what do you know, surrounded by cactuses.
So? Can you do it for me?
Man, get and log off.
God, your ass is so stiff.
I know Gauss, he's out of here tomorrow.
We'll manage somehow.
Hi Karolek.
Man, you know my skills.
And I just happen to be available.
Dude, after that last stunt you pulled, you're finished.
What happened at all? How could you fuck it up like that at the end?
Must be some cutielicious.
Didn't I tell you?
This weakness would drag you down.
This weakness would drag you down. Thank you.
Dude, got a ciggy?
I don't smoke.
Five zlotys at least.
Whatever.
-Here, take it. -Really?
-Here, take it. -Really? Enjoy.
Thanks, boss!
Excuse me!
Midas? Man, it's been ages.
Don Tomas.
Hi. How's it going?
Shitastic, like death warmed over.
Hey, ain't you got a job for me?
Listen, I don't film anymore. I mean, not in Poland, too tight for me. I'm moving to Hollywood.
I mean, not in Poland, too tight for me. I'm moving to Hollywood. Spiffy.
Two shots. Gentlemen?
-Or four. -Or eight.
It's about a wedding.
You, King Midas, down to such potboiler?
You know, I had a small crash, DUI, which means that…
I see, Hollywood is fading away.
In a nutshell.
But they offered me a deal,
if I film that wedding, the DI will give me the passport back.
Yeah, but what do I do?
Listen, I shoot the wedding, ceremony and reception,
few cameras, crane, drone, jib, Tarantino-like dynamics,
and you'll shoot the making-of,
some gibble-gabble, behind the scenes talks.
I'm not sure if I'm good enough. Tomek, you'll make a killing and meet important people.
Tomek, you'll make a killing and meet important people.
Whose wedding is that?
Look at that! Minister Kosecki. Top shelf.
Indeed. The man pulling the strings over Poland.
So he's getting married?
No, come on. His son.
And this is the Honorable Mrs. Minister.
She rings some bells.
She was an actress when she was young, wooden performances.
She got that soon and married a politician.
Here's to her.
-Thanks. -Thanks.
-Here you are. -Thanks a bunch.
-And good luck! -Thanks a lot.
-Good morning! -Oh, good morning!
I have this exhibit for you. From Bolivia.
Blossfildia liliputana.
-So beautiful. -Isn't it?
And ever so small.
She needs a lot of sun and tenderness.
I'll take care of that.
And she hates drafts.
Of course. And thanks for your advice.
And how is Stefan Banach and the other, with spikes in the spiral of Fi…?
-Filius Fibonacci! -Filius Fibonacci.
-Exquisite! And… -Oh yeah?
Mobius let a lateral shoot…
What do you say. It means it wants you to reproduce.
Proliferously, of course.
Of course.
-Bless you. -Thank you. I'm sorry.
-I can help if you want. -Help?
With reproduction.
Because you need to take hold of the pups and…
-And tear it off. -Tear it off?
170… I mean 17, no, 28.
No, I don't believe it. You have a crush on the flower girl.
It's so funny?
-You're allergic to flowers! -Not to cactuses!
No, it's not going to work.
I know all about it.
Unless I help you, but you help me.
Hacking is an offense. And I can't stand parasites.
Okay, I'll pay you for sleeping on that worn-out couch.
-Apparently you're skint. -True, but I've got a job.
And this is a job for two.
I don't understand why I should help you. I don't even like you.
We'll make a quick buck.
And, as your loving brother, I'll help you pick up this chick.
This chick up to pick.
Her name is Klara and I need no advice of yours.
Her name is Klara and I need no advice of yours. You pathetic Casanova.
Well, get out of here.
Well, yes.
To wrap it up, I'll give you the last piece of advice, for free.
You should hit on her on neutral ground.
-Like where? -Outside the flower shop.
-No, I told you. -Let's practice!
You need to ask her different questions.
Women love being asked questions. -About what? -Whatever.
You are Klara, I am you.
Ciao Klarissima.
How are you doing?
I'm sorry about the last time. I ran out and forgot to pay.
Fuck!
Ciao… Klarissima.
Did you hit yourself!
I mean, Miss Klara.
-Sorry it was so sudden and I didn't pay. -No, it's okay.
I just wanted to say, I was just thinking…
-Yes, Mister Janek? -I mean just, well…
-Well, I thought that… -What did you think, Mister Janek?
That we could just… you and me. I mean Miss and me.
Go.
And I need to go to the bank. Can you walk me there?
How's your new purchase?
Leibniz?
An interesting name.
-Also to honor a dead mathematician? -Yes. I put him next to Skłodowska.
Did you know you could graft them together?
Graft? How?
You could make a hole in Skłodowska and put a little Leibniz inside.
Using what?
I mean we could do it together, in the flower shop, if you want, Mister.
I'd love to.
Perhaps we could be on first-name terms? Again. I'm Klara.
Rafał… Paweł… Janek…
Three times.
Perhaps we could go somewhere?
-You mean… together? -Yep.
-Where? -Well… everywhere.
For a coffee, for cream rolls.
Sorry.
-To the cinema, to the park… -This is not a good idea.
I know this is so quick, but this is simply the first time…
It's not about you, Janek.
It's about me.
I'm not the right girl for you. I understand.
I'm sorry. I'm not going to bother you again. Miss.
The wedding is centrally in a week. I don't accept any changes.
But me and my brother are just shooting the making of.
And Midas is shooting the proper movie.
Midas. Whatever he touches… I'll tell him off.
Please, don't do it. This is all my fault.
One needs to fight for your luck, as in the cult movie Fight for Your Luck.
Have you seen Fight for Your Luck?
-This is my favorite movie ever. -But that was ages ago.
-I know all your movies by heart. -All of them. Two.
What you did in Jugs And Jugglers.
Polish cinema has never seen a star with your sex appeal.
You must appear on the screen again.
For us, for all Poles.
-But would camera love me again? -Definitely.
I was told once I was ready for Hollywood. But today it's…
You are gorgeous.
You are extraordinary. You are awesome.
Someone intelligent, finally.
-Tomasz? Is that your name? -Yes.
-Tomasz? Is that your name? -Yes. Call me Patsy.
Sign it and welcome on board.
What's that?
Confidentiality clause.
Whatever you see here is absolutely top secret.
If you spill the beans, my husband… you know who he is.
Exactly.
When he puts someone behind bars, I centrally feel sorry.
All right.
And you? Mute? Why aren't you saying anything?
He's not the sharpest tool in the shed, don't worry about him.
My daughter-in-law is coming. I mean my coming daughter-in-law is coming.
Excuse me. Hello?
Hello?
Hi!
Ola.
Tomek.
Cute name.
Generally, you are all so cute.
You're getting married?
Yeah. Precisely.
Condolences.
And what is that?
What are you doing?!
Hell, when I saw you on that bus.
What's going on at all. And you're standing here.
I wanted to see what'd happen.
Now you know.
Okay. I'm sorry.
Can we start again?
Fool. Moron, schmuck and gull.
What are you laughing about?
That's exactly how great love stories begin.
So?
Let's get down to work.
Oh yeah, we're getting down to work.
I'm sorry, but are you going to pity yourself for a long time?
-Fight for her. Fight for your luck. -But she rejected me.
-Fight for her. Fight for your luck. -But she rejected me. -Nonsense. I saw how she looked at you. -How?
-Nonsense. I saw how she looked at you. -How? -Like you look at her. -But she did say
-Like you look at her. -But she did say that we are not compatible, that it's not a good idea.
Listen, you may be smart, but you are also as helpless as a baby.
It's all part of the game.
-What game? -Conquering game.
You're manly, she's not easy, a win-win situation.
Which means Ola slapped you to conquer you?
Figured out recklessly.
But she's getting married.
But discrimination against the married women would be very impolite.
-Ola's going to be mine anyway. -Yeah, pipe in the sky.
-Ola's going to be mine anyway. -Yeah, pipe in the sky. -Wanni bet? -Bet.
-Wanni bet? -Bet.
The menu centrally needs changing.
We have 30 seafood allergies, 40 peanut,
We have 30 seafood allergies, 40 peanut, 16 exotic fruit, 200 gluten and lactose allergies.
Add gold leaves. Nobody is allergic to gold.
Add gold leaves. Nobody is allergic to gold. -What about tableware? -Insurance company sent the bill.
-What about tableware? -Insurance company sent the bill.
Not bad.
Tableware, as Melania's, will be golden because people say I'm like Melania.
Melania could wash your dishes. Patsy, you are divine.
Attention!
What's that supposed to be? What a bad look.
-Where are the wigs? -They're coming.
-And tights? -Too!
Pull down. Shave. Smile.
No, better without a smile.
Position!
Turn right and… action.
Move it, move it, gentlemen. Keep the pace.
Posture, keep it straight, and remember about the distance, please.
So it's a fancy dress party, right?
You got to be kidding. This is just a rehearsal.
The reception will take place at the Royal Castle.
But this is obviously absolutely top secret.
So…
Our event will relate to the greatness of the Nobles' Republic.
Kuba Wojewódzki will host the reception and take care of the atmosphere. Ed Sheeran, Beyonce and Zenek Martyniuk will provide the music.
Ed Sheeran, Beyonce and Zenek Martyniuk will provide the music.
Take that rug away.
At midnight hundreds of fireworks will illuminate the sky over Warsaw.
Wow!
The Chairman himself will arrive centrally and the President with the First Lady,
Government ministers, loads of foreign VIPs, 1000 guests.
Government ministers, loads of foreign VIPs, 1000 guests. But it's going to cost a fortune.
My husband has a dedicated fund from the Crisis Shield.
Poland has never seen an event like our Little Prince's wedding.
But this is obviously absolutely…
…Top secret.
The son's wedding on Saturday, and husband's election on Sunday.
Neatly planned, isn't it?
Fuck! Are you out of your fucking mind? MP, Paweł Zgrabny
Fuck! Are you out of your fucking mind? MP, Paweł Zgrabny -with Senator Zuzanna Pizana at one table? -I'm sorry, changing it right now.
-with Senator Zuzanna Pizana at one table? -I'm sorry, changing it right now. There will be a bloodshed, centrally. Don't film this. Not this.
There will be a bloodshed, centrally. Don't film this. Not this.
And the balloons? Where the hell are the balloons?
The Great Hall is ornamented by Bacciarelli's plafond…
it's a masterpiece.
-Balloons… -Balloons will be better, right?
-Alexandra!? -What?
Yes, balloons will be better.
It's Kris. Hello, love?
Yes, I miss you, too. Everything under control.
I'm trying but she's driving me mad.
Mrs. Patsy, visualization.
Mrs. Patsy, visualization. Yeah, better with balloons. Hello, are you filming it, Tomek?
Yeah, better with balloons. Hello, are you filming it, Tomek? Yes.
This mechanism has to work better, it needs to be improved.
-But the balloons are generally great. -Sure thing.
-Are you filming it? -Yes, ready now. Can we?
All right, tell me something about your future daughter-in-law.
I hope Aleksandra will be a good wife for my son.
After all, he chose her.
Krystian's always had a good taste, centrally luxurious.
Already as a church server… Excuse me!
Hello? How come it didn't arrive?
Wait a moment, she didn't say much about you.
-Could you tell us more? -No.
Come on, please. Don't put me to trouble. Whatever. About your family. I don't know.
I'm an orphan, brought up by my grandmother.
-That's it? -Yes.
Right. How many guests at this "centrally" big wedding will be yours?
Well, granny and two bridesmaids.
Only three people? Out of a thousand?
Could you look into the camera?
I'd like to know more about you. Say something about you.
I looked for you on Facebook, Insta and you're not there.
I looked for you on Facebook, Insta and you're not there. -Are you a spy or what? -I study.
-Are you a spy or what? -I study.
Okay. What?
Romance studies.
-Which year are you in? -Working on my MA thesis.
-Which year are you in? -Working on my MA thesis. -What's the topic? -About courtly love.
-What's the topic? -About courtly love.
About courtly love?
Courtly love is the archetype of what we call now passionate love.
Crazy, against all odds and all people. But you can't even imagine that.
Do you really know what real passion is?
Okay, tell me more, give me a fragment of something.
"My lords, if you would hear a high tale of love and of death…" -Oh! Tristan and Iseult! -Have you read it?
-Oh! Tristan and Iseult! -Have you read it?
"How to their full joy, but to their sorrow also…"
"They loved each other, and how at last they died together upon one day…"
"She by him and he by her. Amour et Mort."
-I'm sorry, which means what? -Love and death.
Okay. Don't you have something to edit?
-What? -Go check the footage.
-Amour et Mort. -Amour et Mort.
All right, love and death. What then?
It means that only love threatened by death is really touching.
Love playing with risk, love on the edge, love neglecting all the rules.
Help me, you moron.
Well?!
How come they ordered earlier? My flowers?
I don't care about some First Holy Mass.
Whose son?
Ah, I get it.
Lilies would look better in the cathedral, right?
Camelias are mine and you must fucking bring them right here, right now.
I'm ready to do things the easy way, but centrally, when my blood boils…
-I know a great flower shop. Low prices. -Low prices…
Alexandra, are you okay? You're blushing like that.
Alexandra, are you okay? You're blushing like that. Take some pills, don't damage the wedding through some virus.
Take some pills, don't damage the wedding through some virus.
-What are you doing? -It just happened like that.
What, you lovely mother-in-law gave you a hard time?
Yeah, yelling at everyone. She moves me around like furniture.
She wanted to operate my nose, but I might not heal in time.
-What does Kris say? -Still in Dubai.
He should support you.
He sees how much his mum cares. She's so persistent as she's paying for everything.
But I bought the wedding gown!
Take a sip, my child.
The only thing I won is the ceremony.
Quiet, modest, normal.
Ola, what's wrong with you!?
You should be flying of happiness.
And you keep worrying. You look miserable.
Some people react to love this way.
Nonsense. When I was getting married…
Granny, your marriage was not a model relationship.
Which one? With Stefan?
-Weren't we crazy? -I don't wanna listen to that.
We left the bed only when we were starving.
All other time, it was whirring. Whirring!
But now the most important thing is that you can be happy at last.
I am happy. Kris makes all my wishes come true.
-Is it whirring? -What?
Butt. I'm asking if it's whirring.
Listen, this courtly love is really cool.
They kept playing triangles.
The lady is cheating on her man with a sexy knight, that's more like it.
Why didn't they teach us that at school?
You know, you just boil everything down to one thing.
Trivialize everything.
Listen, I know you don't need my advice, but… perhaps?
That's good, for Halloween.
Nope.
Listen, this looks really fine.
Just don't slouch, the posture matters, attitude.
What attitude?
Take things easy, be confident.
She must be aware that you deal the cards.
I don't deal any cards.
Sometimes I really think you're a bit thick.
Body language, use it. Send vibrations, fluids.
-Yeah. -Chicks like it.
Well, I'm proud of you.
Now you can have bunches of them.
I told you I don't need bunches of anything.
I love Klara and I don't want to cheat on her.
I don't want you to cheat on her but make her a bit jealous.
This is a powerful aphrodisiac, man.
Appreciate that, priceless knowledge, and you get it for free.
How many times have I told you I don't need your stupid advice.
Well? Spit it out.
-Thank you. -Come again.
-Thank you. -Come again.
-Good morning. -I'm sorry, I need to go out for a while.
Good morning!
Ah, it's you. I mean… it's you, mister.
It's me.
And you look, mister you look, a bit differently.
A small metamorphosis.
Like you played in Hollywood. With Brad Pitt, Leonardo, or something.
Are you having a laugh? I mean, miss.
No, I'd never, ever laugh at you, at mister.
Sorry for the last time.
We could always be friends. Again.
-Janek. -Klara.
Janek.
What do you think of the global situation?
Of what?
Of the global situation.
-In Africa or the Middle East? -And generally?
-I am generally worried. -About what?
-Generally. -Okay.
-And specifically? -Specifically, well…
climate crisis, global crisis, deforestation of the Amazon rainforest…
climate crisis, global crisis, deforestation of the Amazon rainforest… …terrorism, pandemic, children starving in Africa.
…terrorism, pandemic, children starving in Africa.
-How about Ethiopia? -In Ethiopia, too.
Well, you can't be bothered with all the problems of the world.
Or you can?
Honey Bunny, you're here? Where have you been?
Don't you look gorgeous. How smart, I missed you.
What are you doing? -Come on, that's me! -Leave me alone. Lunatic. Klara!
-Come on, that's me! -Leave me alone. Lunatic. Klara!
-Come on, that's me! -Leave me alone. Lunatic. Klara! Hello, hello, excuse me. Is that man harassing you?
Hello, hello, excuse me. Is that man harassing you?
-What? She's molesting me. -No…
Quiet! Do you want us to calm him down?
This is just a small argument of lovers. Isn't it, Honey Bunny?
Of who?
Out!
Out!
What's up?
You hired this lunatic to scorn and humiliate me.
What's going on?
Klara, she ran away. She cried.
Klara, she ran away. She cried. -Cried? -I guess.
-Cried? -I guess. Good. It means… you are important to her.
Good. It means… you are important to her. You're fucked up in your brain.
-Take it easy. That was the plan. -What plan?
Those in love have always had to overcome adversities.
Those guys. Hamlet and Ophelia, Romeo and Juliet…
To reach the happy ending, it's necessary to make an effort.
Happy ending? They die, you moron!
Trust me.
-And this is my project. Beautiful? -Beautiful.
-I need to go home. -Out of question.
I really do.
Alexandra, do I demand too much? All I need is a bit of support. That's it.
All I need is a bit of support. That's it.
I didn't want such a wedding, just a modest… Modest. What will people say? And opposition?
Modest. What will people say? And opposition?
That my husband fails to respect fundamental values.
-Girls dream of a fairy-tale wedding. -Can I explain?
Now I am talking and you… don't forget you're entering the family.
Our FA-MI-LY. Our position is a commitment.
Our FA-MI-LY. Our position is a commitment. -My husband will be the president soon. -Super. Excuse me! Sorry.
-My husband will be the president soon. -Super. Excuse me! Sorry.
What are you waiting for? Bring her back here.
And what are you waiting for? Recording the cake?
Okay. Let's start again.
Wait.
You can't drive like that. I'll drive.
-How is the contract of your life? -They weren't worth it.
You know, I finished this Tristan and Iseult. Finished? Any thoughts?
Finished? Any thoughts?
Well, you know, quite a story. She's marrying that king…
Well, you know, quite a story. She's marrying that king… …falling for Tristan and like that till they die.
…falling for Tristan and like that till they die.
I know this by heart. I don't need the story.
-Any takeaways? -Well, your life was pretty fugged up.
I mean you, ladies.
Forced to marry for financial reasons.
You think a poor orphan caught a prince?
Attracted by his wealth and status?
No, I'm just recommending myself as Tristan. If you had some dragons to chase.
Thanks, won't be necessary.
But generally a cool option, huh?
-You're getting married, losing virginity with the husband…
and then just do it with others. -You're disgusting.
and then just do it with others. -You're disgusting. -No, it's the book. -Just stop making a fool of yourself.
-No, it's the book. -Just stop making a fool of yourself.
Granny, are you okay? Mr. Bronek called that he called and you don't.
Bronek? He's hysterical. And stubborn as a mule. Doesn't want to see the doctor.
I broke up with him.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
It's Tomek. He's shooting the making-of. -What does that mean? -It's a movie about making a movie.
-What does that mean? -It's a movie about making a movie. Thanks, you can go now.
Thanks, you can go now.
Ola, prepare the tea, please.
And you, sonny boy, fetch the cake and plates.
And then the mother-in-law said saving would "centrally" decrease their prestige.
I hope it will centrally go down.
Nice boy.
Can you see any faults in yourself?
Pity you need to go now, Tomek. It was a pleasure.
Loads of them: gluttony, lack of good manners, excuse me.
Laziness, recklessness, unreliability, flash in the pan, weakness for women.
I'm unstable in my feelings, there's the entire alphabet.
Spitting image of your late grandad, Ola… rascal.
Spitting image of your late grandad, Ola… rascal. -But I believe in love. -Like what?
-But I believe in love. -Like what? Granny, don't listen to him.
I believe that love can change a person.
When we love we become better.
And the world around us becomes better.
Child, write it down. Poetry.
One more piece?
I'll take it, I don't think you'll have it, will you?
Yummy!
Geez, I'm awfully sorry.
-Hello? -Where are you? Patsy's at her wits' end.
Rascal, but he's got kind eyes.
-What do you mean? -The way he's looking at you.
-Like what? -Like that! It's whirring!
-Granny! -Granny. Whirring, whirring.
-Thief! -Stay here!
-It's you? -Who else?
-How could you, come on, how? -Destiny needs a push.
-You're a thief. -Then snitch on me.
-Why didn't you warn me? -I wanted you to act naturally.
And you did. Take it.
-What's going on in here? It's him! -Officers, what are you doing?
-It's not me! -Very good!
-It's not me! -Very good! Officers, it's not him! No!
Officers, it's not him! No!
Officers, it's not him! No! It's not him, not him! Telling you it's not him!
It's not him, not him! Telling you it's not him!
My goodness. Hurts a lot?
-Hurts a lot? -Nothing.
Can I?
-I like you a lot, you know? -I like you, too. That's why we can't.
-That's why? -Yes. I don't want to be guilty.
-But what are you… -I am ill-fated.
Each man I…
The first died on motorbike, second got lost in Asia.
The first died on motorbike, second got lost in Asia. Third had a successful business, which suddenly went bust.
Third had a successful business, which suddenly went bust.
That's why I'm wearing these bags, these overalls,
not to be visible at all.
not to be visible at all. Because I'm afraid I bring bad luck.
Good.
-I don't want to rush things. -I understand…
Good, the asymptote can wait.
It can wait. We'll do it once you're ready.
Thank you.
You are so…
So… so… catty.
Stop moaning!
I forgot my keys.
I see you're in a good mood.
No, I don't believe it, really?
Did your stamen reach her flower bud?
-You're pathetic. -But I was right.
Shared trauma gets people closer.
-That was awfully staged. -But you had no idea.
Now I do and that's it. I'm through filming, too.
Now I do and that's it. I'm through filming, too. Thanks to me, you have reached your flower in a couple of days.
Thanks to me, you have reached your flower in a couple of days.
Don't stand me up now. But Ola is too nice for you, and you're just trying to ruin her life for fun.
But Ola is too nice for you, and you're just trying to ruin her life for fun. I won't allow that.
We had a deal. You promised to help me.
-To get rid of you! -No, you can't leave me like that.
Says who? The king of escape.
-But what's your point? -You know very well.
Mum was dying, and you?
I was studying.
Studying? You call that studying?
Parties, chicks, that was your life.
Not true.
-You can't leave me like that. -Yes, I can.
-No. -Yes.
-No. -Yes. -No! -Yes!
-No! -Yes! No!
Do you know who I am?
Smyra.
-Mr. Smyra, the greatest Polish… -…Polish mafioso.
Nonsense. Georges.
Georges is a lame pickpocket, but he's capable of Savoy cooking.
Please, sit down. Georges, what have you made today?
Relax, Mr. Smyra, it's gonna be tasty. Homard grillé au béarnais.
Lobster for breakfast, delicious.
Take a hand each. And bon appetit.
Let's get to the point. I was supposed to get out on bail soon.
And I would, but Kosecki is conducting another investigation.
Interesting story, but what do we care? Well, I'm sitting here, but my eyes and ears are everywhere.
Well, I'm sitting here, but my eyes and ears are everywhere.
-And what can you see? -You.
-Me? -Casanova from Villanova.
-And how things are. -And how are the things?
Bad!
If in two days young Kosecki is not married, I am what? -Fu…? -Fugged up.
-Fu…? -Fugged up.
Fugged up! And then you are what? Fu…?
…gged up.
Fugged up, worse than turkeys for Thanksgiving.
-At first I'll hurt those you care for. -But we are orphans.
-How about the flower girl? -But these are just cactuses…
Wait a second, just a second. I don't get it.
Wait a second, just a second. I don't get it. -Once again, slowly. -What is the word Kosecki
-Once again, slowly. -What is the word Kosecki -uses all the time? -Death penalty. He's obsessed with it.
-uses all the time? -Death penalty. He's obsessed with it.
Death penalty is right behind it. In the first place is…
family.
When I get to his family, he'll have to sweep my case under the carpet.
Get it?
-Ola has my blood. -How come Kosecki didn't screen it?
He did, but I cleaned the records long before.
So the wedding of Ola and young Kosecki is staged?
You think I'm a bastard trading happiness of my own kid?
No, I don't think so. Making-of is over?
Quite the contrary. Finish your job. This is going to be quite a souvenir.
Get stuffed.
Have you dumped many girls?
A few. They are now definitely happier than then. Why do you ask?
For the first time in my life I'd love to be the rascal you are.
Casanova from Villanova.
-Hi Babe. -Hi!
What's up.
Are you coming in?
No…
Got a date with one of them downtown.
Sorry, I'm through with you.
-Are you high or what? -What? No, I'm going to, you know…
It's not about you, don't look like that, it's about me. I need more freedom.
Well, you know it was cool between us, coco jumbo and all that, but…
… we never promised anything, yeah?
Please, just don't cry, okay?
Coco jumbo and all that. I don't understand.
-Yesterday you liked me. And today? -Today is today. C'est la vie, babe.
Everything ends, yeah? So, see ya around.
Could you sign here, please, and let's get going.
-What's that? -It's an annex. Final cut is our job.
Well, yes.
Kris, can I ask you to clap your hands to the mic for synchronizing?
-Me? -Yes.
One sec. Please.
Oh, sorry, once again.
Okay. When did you meet?
Okay. When did you meet? About a year ago.
A year, 2 months, 5 days and 8 hours ago.
That was love at the first sight.
Oh, incredible, I thought that only happens in the movies.
Apparently, life writes the best scenarios.
And where did you meet?
At the wedding. Ola's friend, my buddy. At the wedding, get it? That was a sign.
What sign?
From above, we were destined to be together.
Wow, how amazingly romantic. And how do you see that, Ola?
The same.
You're so lucky, Kris, you didn't even have to fight for her.
And what do you think of the institution of marriage?
Obviously, marriage is a religious bond between a man and woman…
…being a sacramental expression of their love.
-Ola, what about you? -A romantic voyage into the unknown.
Oh! Voyage, well said. Like voyages of Columbus.
-Precisely. -Yes.
You are Columbus, and I am America you are trying to rob.
Sorry, that's not what…
Am I wrong, or are these questions just stupid?
-Viewers will be curious. -Excuse me, what viewers?
Like their kids.
They'll be happy to see, how their parents started.
By the way, kids, of course, you're planning to have kids, yeah?
You have sex without protection?
You are very coarse. I don't like it. -Let's end it. -We're done.
-We're done. -Final question. Hit it.
We know how you started. But where was your first time?
-Premarital sex is a sin. -Yes.
So you have never?
Yes, we have never.
-Finished? -Yeah!
The Minister is here.
-Your speech, sir. -For the Parliament?
-Your speech, sir. -For the Parliament? No, this one is for the wedding of Kris.
Honey, these are the movie people.
-Take it. Please take… -Just a quick question first.
What are your hopes regarding the marriage of your son?
Marriage. We should first define what it is.
This is a religiously sanctioned bond between a man and woman.
And obviously, the family foundation. And family is the repository…
-You've got here some fiber here, sir. -You could've told me before.
Please, check this. You can see that, can't you?
Please, check this. You can see that, can't you? All's good, calm down.
I'm sorry, Minister.
Marriage is the foundation of family, and family is the repository
of sacred values and traditions… which our ancestors fought for, so we could be free…
and procreate to the benefit of our most beloved motherland.
Therefore, the priority of my presidency will be pro-family policies.
Okay, then.
At 5 p.m. our honorable guests are welcomed…
Swiftlier!
Merci de nous honorer de votre presence.
Grazie per onorarci con la tua presenza.
Ma'am, all's perfect!
Okay, talk to me. Let's go further.
Right, sit down, ladies and gentlemen.
Now at 18:03. The bridegroom's father speech.
There's this key sentence, I believe… Okay, it's gonna be beautiful and moving.
Okay, it's gonna be beautiful and moving.
We're all centrally crying.
Crying, yeah! Crying.
Harder!
-Did I say anything funny? -No.
-What's so funny? -Nothing.
-You've been very absent-minded recently. -I'm sorry.
Okay, the Minister has finished.
And now… applause. Come on, is that applause?
Standing ovation. Ovation.
President Kosecki! President!
Thank you, thank you very much.
I swear that I will be the redoubt of defense of true Polish family.
We won't allow our enemies to undermine Poland.
-Our traditional values. -Don't be a fool, it's just a rehearsal.
-What? -It's just a rehearsal.
Where are you going?
We're going to practice wedding games.
-But I have the government meeting. -Fuck the government!
When people see in the net, you're one of them, your polls will go up.
-If you say so, hun. -You entangled my hair.
Stop. It can't be like that.
What's your problem? We are here, in our Polish home.
We're not going to dance when they play music in foreign languages.
There you go!
Kosecki for the president!
-He did it again! -As if it was the president's chair.
-He did it again! -As if it was the president's chair. President Ko-sec-ki!
One, two. And now the most moving moment of this evening.
The newly married couple, Krystian and Aleksandra.
Unfortunately, Krystian is not here. He's multiplying GDP. Tomasz?
-Could you replace him? -Me?
-May I ask you? -I'm surely not as good as he is.
Of course you're not. But it's just a rehearsal.
All right. Take it.
-And? -And nothing, just stand there.
Well, you're asking for trouble.
-Do you have to butter her up? -Are you jealous or what?
-Does that make you happy? -What?
-Being an asshole. -Nobody is a better asshole than me.
Come on, you'll warm up before the bachelorette party.
What's that?
Stop it. Turn it off! Turn it off now!
Pause! Centrally, pause!
You saw nothing.
Forget about it immediately.
Your mother-in-law is stalking on me.
Well, I guess I've just lost my job.
-What would you like to drink? -Thank you.
-I need to edit the footage. -Could you undo my dress first?
I need to lay down, and I don't want to crease it.
-I could call someone. -To undo my dress?
Well, okay.
Thank you.
See, I don't bite.
-Where are you going? -You said you were tired.
-Where are you going? -You said you were tired. -I don't wanna disturb you. -Could I ask for one more thing?
-I don't wanna disturb you. -Could I ask for one more thing? -What for? -Massage my neck.
-What for? -Massage my neck.
I feel so tense.
-But I… I'm not a massage guy. -Listen, what's your problem?
It's just a small request.
You don't think I'm trying to hook you up, do you?
-Well, no. -I wouldn't do it to my husband.
Anyway, he'd have you castrated.
To begin with, cause later…
Thank you. You should do that for a living.
Can you mix up one more for me, please?
Fuck.
-Patsy, come on… -You said you've been dreaming of it.
-Well, yes. -Did you lie?
-No. -To get this job.
-No… -Of course, you didn't.
-Do you desire me? -Yes.
-I see it in your eyes. -Well, yes.
-Are you afraid you won't manage? -No.
I promise to be understanding.
And what will you husband say? He's gonna castrate me.
He gives no shit.
He gets a hard-on only when he thinks about presidency.
Divine Patsy will make all your dreams come true.
I'll show you tricks, babe, you can't even imagine.
Yes, Mr. Chairman?
No problem, Mr. Chairman.
I shit all over these law professors.
There's a man, there's a law against him.
Always at your command, Mr. Chairman.
Moron.
-Me first. Yes. -Yes.
-Me first. Yes. -Yes. I'll burn your desire.
Where are you going? Where are you going, babe?
Where are you going? Where are you going, babe? I'll burn your passion.
My wife, where is she? Her place?
No habla Polish?
Fucking immigrants!
I'm burning… burning? Fire!
Bitter!
-Toast. To Ola! -Yes, to Ola!
Listen I thought we have to give her something old, for luck.
-Absolutely! Some necklace… -Necklace… goes well with the dress?
Or a ring.
It's gonna look great, and fit as well.
-Oh! Speak of the devil. -Just don't spill the beans.
-Hey! -Hi girls. Start without me.
Sorry, granny's not very well, but you two have fun. All's paid.
-Ola, what happened? -Nothing.
Why did you come here?
Go back to the boys and never mention that again.
-Mum, but I like her. I really like her. -Son, we can't roll back now.
No! I can't do it to her. Don't you get that?
Don't be a sissy! Don't forget what's at stake.
In three days your father will be the president.
-Oh! You are here. Come in. Is everything okay?
-Oh! You are here. Come in. Is everything okay? -Yes, but… -But Ola called…
-Yes, but… -But Ola called… Ola's not at her best. It's her bachelorette party.
Ola's not at her best. It's her bachelorette party. And she's alone.
Help her, please.
I'm going to Bronek. See ya!
I'm going to Bronek. See ya! Go! My Lord, go now!
Go! My Lord, go now!
Are you crying?
I'm not crying.
I didn't invite you here at all.
-Why are you marrying him? -Just because!
He gives me the sense of safety and accepts me the way I am.
-That's it. -It's not enough?
You forgot the most important.
That you love him.
It's obvious, I guess.
Go away now.
So? It's over?
You see, everything is over at one point.
Is that the end of this great, passionate romance?
What did you think, hey?
That you'd leave this asshole and fall for me.
Nope. Go away now.
-Argentinian rebutia you ordered. -Thank you.
-You're not living alone? -With my brother.
-I'd no idea you have a brother. -Cause it's like I didn't.
We were never compatible.
-I don't believe you. -No, really.
-He's totally different. -I don't believe what you said last time.
I just want to understand. Tell me the truth, please.
Because I am an ordained priest.
-Oh, that's not a big deal. -No!
I mean it's impossible, dishonest.
Sure.
I'd better go now.
-I'll walk you. -No, please don't.
Ordained priest? You…
Hey, kitty, where are you going?
A hottie like that shouldn't be at night alone.
Don't say you're afraid of us. Look how fine boys we are.
-How about a triangle? -I'll give you a triangle, you boor!
Leave her alone. Unless you want to face me.
Help!
Okay, he's down, let's get out of here.
Are you alive? My God. Hurts a lot?
Are you alive? My God. Hurts a lot? You scared me.
-Who are you? -It's me, Klara, don't you recognize me?
-I do. Where are those guys? -They ran away as quickly as they could.
-I do. Where are those guys? -They ran away as quickly as they could. It means I didn't quite whip them out.
But you know, for one second, my whole life flashed before my eyes.
Your whole life flashed before eyes. You're not very well.
No, but it happens. The dilatation of time, space-time warp.
-In the theory of relativity… -I don't understand anything.
I understood, that's important.
What's happening here? It's them?
-Public sex? -There's a law against it.
-We know you. -We have met.
Oh, it's them again.
-We are fugged up. -Kosecki is going to kill us.
-Not to mention your father. -How do you know?
Listen, I haven't seen him for 12 years. We've moved three times.
-I don't wanna have anything in common. -Easy. I believe you.
Listen to me.
Pack your stuff, I'm back in three hours and we're outta here.
-They're gonna get us. -I won't let them hurt you.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
I'm sorry.
What's so funny? Well?
-No, nothing. -What?
Your shiner, but you look good with it.
I'm sorry. That was my first time, I've never before…
…ouch… fought with anybody.
And you were trying to protect me.
My chivalrous knight.
No need to be afraid.
You'll be free after the wedding.
-When I look at you, I see myself. -Oh yeah?
-What do we have in common? -More than you think.
I used to look… different.
Great job. Great marriage.
Until my Zuzia went to bed with her boss.
I kicked her out and started to drink.
Planned to kill them both.
But the more I wanted, the more I drank, and couldn't come to grips with myself.
-And what happened then? -Time went by.
I lived like a bum for nine years. Down in a hole. I stank.
One day my buddy took me for a job,
to renovate this house.
-We're going, and who's there? -Zuzia.
My Zuzia.
She looked more beautiful than ever. I thought my heart'd break into pieces.
She looked more beautiful than ever. I thought my heart'd break into pieces. -Did she recognize you? -Who's looking at the proles?
-Did she recognize you? -Who's looking at the proles?
Her husband talked to us. Anyway, the same loser she cheated on me with.
-And what, you took revenge? -Well, not really. I started crying.
She was blooming. Kids.
Great house. Wealthy life.
I felt so grateful that punk didn't waste her.
Any punch line?
-Leave Ola alone. -Why?
I checked who you are. You are a screw and broke ass.
-What can you give her? -Love.
Love? You have no idea what love is.
Love is not making out.
It's not taking, but giving.
Sometimes I go there.
Sit in the car and look at Zuzia.
And I cry. For the great love and joy, I didn't fuck up her life.
Good morning.
I'll marry him. I promise.
You're so beautiful.
I begot an angel. The living image of your mum.
I begot an angel. The living image of your mum. How dare you talk about her? You ruined her life. As well as mine.
How dare you talk about her? You ruined her life. As well as mine.
You're ashamed of me and you're right, but this was my job.
You were a great dad between your secret missions.
Anyway, I don't believe in any secret missions.
-When I was 11 you disappeared for good. -But I always cared for you.
Oh yeah?
Remember the bully downstairs? Who ended up in hospital.
And the bastard who was harassing you?
The professor who didn't want to give you a credit for culture studies, if you were not nice to him. Remember?
if you were not nice to him. Remember?
I never asked you for anything, but now I do. Let Tomek go.
-What? -I have an offer for Mr. Smyra.
Stay here, you too.
-What did you give him? -You'll see.
Moment. Not my phone.
-Eye? -Fell off the horse.
-What horse? -White.
-What horse? -White. When in shining armor I hurried to help Klara.
When in shining armor I hurried to help Klara.
Unbelievable.
-I'm sorry. -What for?
For dragging you in all that.
And that I didn't help with mum.
Give me a break. You studied. -No. I was afraid. -Of what?
-No. I was afraid. -Of what?
To see her fade away.
It was irritating, but you were always the apple of her eye.
Get lost.
You have Mr. Smyra's blessing.
Slow down. Can you slow down?
-How did you track me down? -GPS.
But you don't even cross the road on red light.
But you're my brother. And we had a bet. You won.
And I'm an asshole. I don't deserve Ola.
That's true. But they deserve even less.
I have evidence in my phone.

You can't see her. -It brings bad luck. -Mum…

Let's get inside. Don't "mum" me. Let's get inside.
Ignacy.
What's happening?
Please, don't panic.
Breathe in, breathe out.
Ola, aren't you sure?
Granny…
Look out!
There! That way!
Faster, girls. The schedule is centrally down.
-Are you okay? -No. No, but…
You changed your mind? -No, I need to tell you something. -You don't need to.
-No, I need to tell you something. -You don't need to. But we need to trust each other. We can't have any secrets between us.
But we need to trust each other. We can't have any secrets between us.
-Everyone has some. -Do you have, too?
-Of course. -Great.
-What again? -I can't move!
It's a bad omen, bad luck. You want a punch in the nose?
You want a punch in the nose?
-Snickers! -Yeah!
Borrowed clothes bring good luck. Balances the bad luck.
Move it.
-Got signal? -Yep, but nobody answers.

-No answer. -Call again.
-No answer. -Call again. I'm calling. Can't you see?
-Perhaps it's started? -Over my dead body!

Can't you see my Bucephalus has just kicked the bucket.
And that is going to stop you?
With me in the studio is sister Salomea, a consultant of traditional Polish weddings.
Good afternoon, Sister.
During the wedding of the year, as the Kosecki ceremony is referred to, Beyonce is going to sing "Barka" - the "Barge" in English.
Beyonce is going to sing "Barka" - the "Barge" in English.
Sister, is this appropriate?
Shouldn't the star perform this important Polish song in Polish?
This is not the right moment. Really. Stop it for a second.
Not now!
Organizing a private reception in the Royal Castle. Is this appropriate?
Not, it is not appropriate. This is a joke on Polish citizens.
Ladies and gentlemen, the arrogance of this government is beyond belief.
Take that drone away.
-Buddy, how much for this scrap? -How much do you offer?
A hundred?
-Not enough… -It's not worth half of it.
Market law, supply is subject to demand.
-All right, two hundred. -Not enough…
There you go. All I have.
-Fuck. Where's my bike? -There!
Hail Mary…
Hallelujah.
Praise the Lord and rejoice.
Because on that day,
the Lord shall bond forever these two young people.
If I speak all tongues Of men and of angels
But speak without love
I am only a resounding gong
Or a clanging cymbal
Can you take me to the other side? -Of course. -Great.
-Of course. -Great.
At 3 p.m.
At 3 p.m. it will be all over.
The girl I'm in love with is getting married.
Accepted.
Love is patient Love is kind
This vortex, can you see it? Lovers got drowned here. For love.
-And that tree over there? -Very pretty.
That's where miller's daughter and her boy hanged themselves. Also for love.
And there, another one hanged himself, trying to drag a girl away from the altar.
Super.
I'm not sure if it's so fucking super.
Repeat the wedding vow after me.
"I, Bronisław."
Well, repeat: "I, Bronisław."
I, Krystian.
-Krystian? -Krystian.
So repeat: "You, Krystian."
I, Krystian…
-"take you…" -Aleksandra.
"…Aleksandra as my wedded wife."
"…take you Aleksandra as my wedded wife."
"…and I promise…"
"…to be your loving and faithful husband."
"And I promise to be your loving and faithful husband."
Now you repeat.
Hey, buddy, buddy!
Moron.
"I Alexandra, I take you, Tomasz…"
"to be my wedded husband…"
So Hallelujah.
-Hallelujah. -Hallelujah.
Are you entering into this holy relationship of your own will?
No!
And, now you can… And Hallelujah.
No!
You're not honest with her.
I'd rather take a seat.
He doesn't love you.
I'm sorry.
Go!
Sending.
How did you get it?
So you knew?
You knew all the way.
Sure you did.
How could you force him? How could you do this to both of them?
How could you force him? How could you do this to both of them? -What kind of people are you? -What do you want?
-What kind of people are you? -What do you want?
Three things.
-First, there was no wedding. -How? There was a wedding!
The priest may not hand over the papers to the registry office.
Fine. This goose did not deserve Kris anyway.
Second, let Smyra go.
-Smyra? Who's that woman? -Ask your husband.
Kosa resigns from the election.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
He's already been elected.
We know the results.
Well… Polish nation somehow can live with that.
And the reception?
What about my centrally great wedding reception?
Yes!
Klara…
Yes.
"I Kris…"
…as my wedded husband.

Mariusz!
Is Hitler alive?
Fuck knows.
We'll throw him a birthday party anyway.
-Sponge cake with mascarpone. -Fucking delish.
Dibs on the swastika.
You had it last time. The swastika is for everyone.
Every single time.
Come to Warsaw.
It's not a postcard city.
It's full of sex and money.
This is cool. It's nice that everyone came.
It'll be fucking dope.
RYS
SPEECH OUTLINE
Roman, it's time.
Roman!
Scram.
Okay, I'm good.
Welcome, everyone,
to Adolf Hitler's 132nd birthday party near Białystok.
A party organized by the Radical Youth Society!
Let's start with a few words about the birthday boy.
He was one of the finest commanders and strategists,
whose beautiful vision
was brutally interrupted by his premature death.
-So, dead. -He was a gentleman.
-He fascinated women. -Are the girls coming?
-What? -They came last year, right?
No girls. They're unwell.
And they're not answering calls. Moving on to the main event. Gentlemen!
Let's unveil the symbol that defines us.
A symbol that inspires respect among the true ones
and fear among our enemies.
Help me down. Fuck.
-What? -Look here.
Yeah?
Police! Hands up!
Police!
I told you they'd be back!
No, Fighting Poland--
OPERATION: NATION
Turn it off.
Marlena, turn it the fuck off!
Turn yourself off! You promised me headphones.
I'll buy you a brain.
-Seriously? -What?
-I have ten more minutes to sleep. -Jeez.
No way. What's that peacock doing on my side?
I preferred soccer players on there, not some knights.
And I preferred when you had Pokémon.
-Technically, you still do. -It's BMZ, you moron.
They have ten billion views.
All of them yours?
-Yeah. -Yeah.
You've become less nice since you fell over.
I didn't fall over. I was fouled. How many times do I have to tell you?
My only chance to get out of here. Out of Białystok?
First, out of this room.
FIGHT FOR YOUR BROTHERS
Staszek, hurry up.
I want that Kim Jong-Un gone by the time I get back.
-You wiener. -Staś!
Goodbye, my beloved sister.
Bye.
Kim Young-mun, asshole.
Hey, Stachu!
WELCOME!
Fuck.
Morning, Boss.
Yeah.
V6, huh?
Yeah.
Work hard, Stachu, and one day I'll be able to afford more of them.
Boss, can I talk to you for a second?
Chop-chop. The building site's in shambles.
I have three Grigoris but 29 fingers, so something doesn't add up.
-I've been working here for almost a year. -Yup.
So, you could say it's permanent.
-And-- -Nothing in life is permanent.
Not even your damn fingers.
I thought that maybe I could…
I mean, maybe you could give me a contract, Boss.
Staszek, stop swearing.
Fuck…
Boss…
When I was sick for a week without pay, it was carnage.
I'm 20 years old. I wanna rent a studio apartment.
I share a room with my sister. I share with my wife and I don't complain.
Relax, Staszek…
-Boss-- -You…
-You know what you need, boy? -I'm telling you, Boss.
Siberian ginseng.
Siberian jeans-end?
Ginseng, for goodness' sake!
An immunity adaptogen. A dietary supplement.
Staszek, I take seven different ones a day and look at me fucking go.
Supplementation.
Staszek, invest in yourself.
Everyone in Poland says, "Give, gimme." Constant demands.
Damn, everyone's on welfare. But you've got to be tough.
I also barely make ends meet, but I keep moving forward.
So, am I supposed to pay for the studio with that jeans-end?
Watch it, Staś.
You know how many Grigoris would die for your job?
Literally.
Fuck.
Pola, you're back
too soon.
And that's the problem?
-Me being back too soon? -You're right.
Instead of pointing fingers… #MY PUSSY MY BUSINESS
…let's look for a solution together.
-Three heads are better than one. -Who's that?
This is…
-Larysa. -Larysa.
-With an "A." -"A."
It's okay.
Polaris, listen.
I think that the level of partnership we've achieved
allows us to move on to the next stage.
You're proposing to me now?
No.
I was thinking more of polyamory.
You can't be serious.
Why?
You're still looking for a topic for your master's thesis.
Polyamory is an excellent topic.
-I'd be happy to help. -There you go! Maybe on Thursday?
I can't do Thursdays.
Shut up, bitch!
Whoa! Hey, Pola.
I never thought you'd slut-shame anyone like that.
No? Slut!
Oh, so when a girl sleeps with multiple guys she's a skank,
but when I sleep with multiple girls, I'm a cool dude and a hotshot?
No, Kajetan. You're just an ordinary dick.
-What are you doing? -I thought I'd tidy up.
I'm moving the fuck out.
-Where to? -I dunno. Home.
Wait.
I don't think I want a long-distance relationship.
Besides, what about work?
Do you even listen to me?
I told you I was fired, you idiot.
A week ago.
Call me when you get there.
She took my top.
-It's cool, I'll get a new one. -My top.
Going to Białystok?
Watch yourself over there.
As God is my witness, they made a swastika out of Jaffa Cakes there.
There's nothing good over there.
Due to the premises
that raising an outstretched arm can be interpreted as a Roman salute,
and the swastika is primarily a Hindu symbol of happiness,
the court has not found evidence of promoting a totalitarian regime.
This hearing is concluded. The defendants are free to go.
See? I drew it right.
Disgrace!
DISTRICT COURT
-Any comments on the ruling? -Hitler's birthday. What's next?
-Dunno. His name day? -All right.
Everyone,
today's ruling only goes to show
that patriotism in Poland
is no longer a crime,
and that there is a new political force, which shouldn't be underestimated.
RYS. Thank you very much.
-And the ruling? -Talk to my lawyers.
-Just a few words. -Move!
Staszek, I'm glad you came.
Sure thing. You picked me up from training multiple times.
Meet my staff. Mieszko, Mariusz, Brajan.
From the Old Polish Brajanisław. It's a real name.
Staszek Sułkowski, my cousin.
-Staszek Sułkowski? SS. Respect. -I remember you.
You scored five goals against Krypnianka. A fucking good game.
-The riot after was even better. -Yeah.
Good times.
Torn ACL, meniscus… Remember that fundraiser I held?
-Yeah. -That was for Staszek.
-Fight for your brothers, yeah? -Time hits all wounds.
Too bad you didn't see the people's faces when they announced the ruling.
We're heroes like the cursed soldiers.
-Except we're not cursed. -Except shut it, Mieszko.
But they'll talk about us.
There'll be… How should I put it? There'll be…
-Street cred? -No, Staszek.
Drop this Black slang.
We should say, "Glory to the territory."
Let's go.
Dibs on the window seat!
-Move, Brajan. -But… Fucking hell.
Move, Brajan.
Roman?
Hitler's birthday, was that for real?
Stachu, come on. You believe the media?
How's work?
-Okay. -Yeah?
Ukry don't want to work for half of your measly pay?
I've nothing against them but…
It's either us or them. There's no other way.
The trial of the Białystok neo-Nazi group,
charged with celebrating Hitler's birthday, has ended.
The boys really went all out.
There even was a cake with a wafer swastika,
which begs to ask if there was a clown.
Actually, clowns were the only ones attending.
Some German radio station.
Gentlemen…
I call for brain blitzkrieg.
I expect each one of you to give me an idea for our next move.
You think too, Staszek.
I stay out of politics, man.
It's time to make a decision, Staszek.
No more soccer for you, right?
Now what?
You wanna spend your whole life in a cubbyhole?
Beat your meat in the bathroom when everyone's gone to sleep?
Or will you fight for yours?
The nation needs you.
I need you.
This is your team now.
Red means brave, white means blessed! RYS!
White above anything else! RYS!
Who? RYS!
Charge! RYS!
See ya.
Roman, wait. When do you need the ideas?
NSDAP.
NSDAP?
…it'll be warm…
Yesterday they said it would rain. See how these fuckers lie?
What would you do to make a lot of people find out about you?
How much time do you have?
Look at me. This is how you choke the bitch.
Hey!
Like that! There's basically no way out of this hold.
Mariusz, my towel is slipping off!
There won't be towels out there! Break free!
Mariusz, the practice is over! Give me a break!
I'm so wired.
I feel like…
smashing someone's head in.
Mariusz.
-You're still in a towel? -Still.
Everyone's coming soon.
Where's that cubbyhole?
Where's the rest?
Most activists kinda lost their zeal after the birthday fiasco.
Quick. The yoga guy's coming in half an hour, and he's a dick.
-Why are we here? -Taking a modern approach. Hybrid war.
Staszek, my blood, had a good idea. Tell them.
We'll live stream
the RYS manifesto and
hope it goes viral.
What about my idea?
Catch a few Chechens, strip them naked and take photos?
To show them up.
I'm unprepared, okay?
Roman?
-What is this… plushie? -It's not a plushie. On the contrary!
It's a Jew we're about to burn.
It'll emphasize the message and add drama.
RYS
"The RYS manifesto."
"The modern world presents us with many threats."
"But we face them, proudly shouting out 'Death to enemies of the Fatherland!'"
Death to the enemies of the Fatherland!
"The fire that burns inside us,
just like the flame behind me,
will burn all that is evil and impure."
"The burning effigy of a Jew represents the Catholic spirit…
Move.
…which can't be extinguished by any form of leftism."
Anything yet?
-"Are they--" -What's wrong?
"Are they the wafer guys? What flavor was the cake, fuckwits?"
"Your cock."
Try here.
-What are they writing? -Adler: "Losers." Michał123: "Clowns."
Fuck off, Adler.
Fuck off…
"From the ruins of the civilization of death
and from the ashes of Zionism,
like a phoenix, a great Poland shall be reborn."
-Some Marlenka is roasting us hard. -Yeah.
Fuck!
It won't fucking burn.
"According to EU regulations--"
-What? -This is fireproof material.
There's a symbol here.
Fucking awesome. How was I supposed to know?
Why don't you write that on your fucking forehead?
I guess you'll end up drawing a swastika instead of a question mark!
We could hang it.
I conclude the manifesto with a rhyme.
"The Jew is burning, free Poland is returning."
What am I supposed to say now?
"The Jew is hanging…"
We are banging?
I don't know. Maybe the lighter doesn't work?
GOD, HONOR, FATHERLAND INDEPENDENCE
You see that guy? He's got the nerve.
-You, look at yourself. -What?
-You're Black. -How do you know? Do I know you?
I can see! Brajan, tell him. I'm out of patience.
-Stop hitting on Polish girls, ape. -Karol, let's just leave.
Where you going?
"Where are."
What?
You missed the auxiliary verb. "Where are you going?"
Nowhere. I'm waiting for Roman.
-I don't want any trouble. -Roman's here.
-Roman's here. -You're lucky, bitch.
Sorry, but you'd better go.
Fuck off, Nazi.
To happy returns?
Temporary ones.
We'll see. Have you seen our city's motto? "Rising Białystok."
-We're just getting started. -That's what worries me.
So tell me, what even is a Larysa?
Seriously. Is it a car? What's that about?
A giant fish.
Okay, what's next?
See the guy in purple?
He's a big shot among leftist.
A militant?
A photographer. Leftist paparazzi.
Stachu.
As Leader of RYS,
I hereby issue a decree obligating you to bludgeon his head.
Me?
Ye.
Now?
Now.
I'd do it myself, but it will be your baptism.
Leftist scum.
Go.
I actually like baptisms.
I think the Baptism of Poland was fucking dope.
To a world without losers?
I just gave you a swipe
right.
What do you say?
That's nice, but I'm having a beer with my friend.
-Hi. -I'm not interested in her.
What was that for?
As if you don't know.
-Hey, thanks for your help. -What help?
So humble. What was that about?
That?
Leftist scum.
Judeo-Communism!
I'm Pola.
Stanisław.
-Anka. -Stanisław.
Stanisław…
What's a Larysa?
-What? -Larysa.
Larysa?
I dunno. A fish?
Stanisław!
Shouldn't you exchange your phone numbers now?
Okay.
Don't read my texts.
It'd be hard with the cracked screen.
Stanisław.
Don't invite her to your place on the first date.
Anka.
See ya?
Yeah.
-Come on, let's go. -No!
We're going.
Fucking bastard.
It's time to take real subversive action against the enemies of the fatherland.
-Time for terror and violence. -Yeah.
Like when we blew up Zglenicka's mailbox for chasing us out of her yard?
-Great idea, Staszek. -What idea?
We'll blow up the synagogue.
We'll do what?
Didn't you get that?
We'll blow away the son of Gog.
Time to prove that the Youth Society is truly radical.
-Can Poland count on you? -Yes!
Sure.
We need new headquarters.
Time to use our old contacts.
Come in, boys.
I planted these cedars when I got this parish.
Linden.
-Remember Kochanowski? "Oh, Guest…" etc. -Beautiful.
Holy Mary…
And this is my
temporary earthly dwelling.
-Come in. -Thank you, Father.
-My boys. -Thank you.
And this is our kitchen. Come in.
Tea, coffee?
Maybe coffee?
These stairs are antique.
As if to Heaven.
Come on up.
My boys.
And this is the room I've told you about, boys.
Here! We've got some hymnals.
When the morning lights arise…
On Tuesdays we have a choir practice. Join us.
Roman, promise me it's going to be empty.
No people.
Promise.
Sure, it'll be empty.
Follow me. This is kind of a relaxation area.
It warms my heart that we can help you.
How long have we known each other?
After all, the youth is the future of our nation.
It's swell that there's action at the rectory.
-You boys are swell. -Thank you.
Also, to complete the formalities, what does your organization do?
We…
We promote family values, Father.
-We oppose gender ideology, LPTB. -Pokémon.
-Harry Potter. -Pope Francis.
Avada Kedavra!
And you can take a joke. Brilliant!
It's a shame
that there aren't more boys like you.
-Bye. -God bless.
POLA: 17? SEE YOU THEN
Gotta go.
Dad needs my help with the renovation.
See ya.
…lights arise
For Thee sing the Earth The sea and the skies
For Thee sing all living beings…
-After you. -Thank you.
My treat.
-Of course. -Of course?
-I'm a guy. -Oh, that's right.
And you provide for a poor woman who doesn't work and is raising two kids,
having given up on her goals in high school?
I was thinking four.
I was away for a while.
Now I'm back, and I'm suffocating. All these anti-Semitic tags on the walls…
There was this survey,
"What would you do if your child turned out to be Homo sapiens?"
Half of the respondents said they'd kick them out.
They get simple slogans and go with it, but all it takes is to look in their eyes
and say, "Hey…
you don't need this crap,
hate is not the answer,"
before it's too late,
and they start throwing parties for Hitler.
Have you heard about that?
-I've heard a bit. -There's no hope for those idiots.
That's what all these fantasies about a great, national Poland lead to.
Are you okay?
Yes. Fuck.
These pierogi are sweet. I know, right?
Listen, can we change the subject?
Sorry, I got worked up.
Any suggestions?
If you could go to space…
and become the mother of a new planet, would you do it?
Damn.
Hell, yeah.
Okay.
What's your favorite color?
-Yellow. -Yellow?
-Okay. Dogs or cats? -Cats.
-No way! -Always cats.
-Only dogs. -Cats.
No.
Fine. Let it be cats.
-What's your favorite movie? -Killer.
What would you change your gender to?
S'up!
S'up.
-Who are you? -Poland.
-And you? -Also Poland.
Where's Roman?
What are we doing?
Made in Poland.
No, thanks. I already had some today.
We must support Polish industry, local suppliers.
Okay, what are we doing?
Gentlemen!
Come here!
Assembly time!
Sit down!
-Do you know what that means? -Tee-cat, so "cat."
Thanks to my channels
I got in touch with an experienced Italian fascist terrorist.
And?
He's coming here!
What for?
To teach you draw a swastika.
-Seriously? -No, not fucking seriously!
To teach us how to build a bomb!
-Howdy, boys. -Howdy.
You've been up here so long, you're probably hungry.
Thank you.
Father…
Charades.
I used to love playing charades. Who'll guess this?
A gazelle?
-A woman? -Yes!
Pierced with a knife?
It's…
A woman…
A leftist woman?
LTGB?
The fall of white Europe?
Romuś… Maybe it's too hard.
A woman pierced with a knife is what?
Stabbed?
Yes, and the answer is: Stabat Mater.
I used to show it better.
-It was great. -Really.
Very creative.
Terrorist attack on a synagogue.
Did I get it?
I've still got it!
Except…
That's better.
Eat up and have fun. Cheerio!
Thank you.
I dunno, maybe I'm dyslectic?
Hey.
Hello, Staszek.
Where were you?
None of your business.
As long as you live under our roof, it is our business.
-Sit down. -I'm working on it.
Sit down.
Is everything all right?
Recently, we have been feeling that something
bad is going on, that you're lost.
You know, all these posters…
We're worried that you fell in with the wrong crowd.
You only meet up with boys.
Son, you don't have any posters of girls.
Haven't you heard of Pamela Anderson?
-Who? -Claudia Schiffer?
So you both think I'm gay?
If you really must know, I was on a date.
With a girl?
-Obviously. Who else? -What's her name?
-Pola. -Where did you meet?
-At the bar. -How old is she?
Hesitated. He's lying.
-I don't know, 21? -What's her name?
-You've already asked. -Magda?
-Pola. -Paweł?
Pola!
For your information, Pola exists, and I think she likes me.
But it doesn't matter because she's going to Warsaw,
and I'll stay here with a hopeless job, a 15-year-old roommate,
and an army of Asians on my walls.
Happy?
Is the interrogation over?
Thank you very much.
-Were you eavesdropping? -No.
STANISŁAW SUŁKOWSKI WORKS AT A PARKING LOT.
HE'S STILL KNOWN…
…ENDED BEFORE IT EVEN BEGAN…
YOUTH PICNIC
YOUNG PATRIOTS PRAYED FOR THE HOMELAND. RESIDENT CONCERNED ABOUT THE NAZI SALUTES.
Why is this synagogue unfrequented?
You see, Jews in our country are smart enough to camouflage.
They worship our God, pay taxes.
They're model citizens.
-Motherfuckers. -Yup!
Hello?
My name is Pola Ratajczyk. I'd like to talk to you.
Listen, let's put on balaclavas, so she can't identify us.
-But we're not hiding. -I don't want to risk it.
Suit yourself.
And let's not use our real names.
Who knows what she's after?
-You're jumpy, Staszek. -Sławek!
I'm Sławek, okay?
Sławek.
-May I have a moment? -Please.
My name is Pola Ratajczyk.
Mieszko.
Brajan.
Mario.
Roman Pisz, founder…
and leader.
That's Sławek over there.
He has chickenpox.
Take a seat.
How may I help you?
I'm writing a master's thesis about your organization.
Bravo!
What inspired you to establish RYS?
I'd like to conduct a series of interviews with each one of you.
That won't be necessary. Talking to me will suffice.
Great.
What's your aim?
-Meaning? -What are your postulates?
A free Poland.
Is it not free now?
Now it's too free.
I mean, there must be freedom.
But limited.
God, Honor, Fatherland.
-I think that explains it all. -That's right.
God condones celebrating Hitler's birthday?
God was white.
-Was he, or maybe she? -Can't be.
Then he would've impregnated Joseph, not Mary, right?
I'd like to authorize this interview, yes?
We have a meeting scheduled--
-Meeting? What are you planning? -This isn't a university.
I know. It's a rectory.
Did you see how she was looking at me?
-We have to keep an eye on her. -I'll handle it.
Gentlemen, I have a message from our Italian friend.
"See you tomorrow. I'm in Warsaw."
-You know what that means? -He said "war."
"This is war."
This means…
that our operation under the code name I haven't come up with yet,
is entering its final phase.
Watch this.
-And? -Again.
-Ready? -Just play.
-Ouch! -What happened?
-Ouch. -Show me.
You know-- Hey, come on! Pola!
-That's not fair. Cheating. -You know what that means?
-What? -That you've lost.
You have to tell me something no one else knows.
-There was no bet. -There was.
-There wasn't. -A deal's a deal.
-Give me the ball. -No.
Well?
For real?
Never…
Never have I ever…
-Jeez. -Yeah?
I've never…
I've never seen The Lion King.
What?
-Why? -I dunno.
Just never happened.
Gosh, didn't your parents love you?
My parents are dead.
OMG, Staszek. I'm sorry.
-It was a stupid joke, I'm so-- -I'm kidding.
Ouch! Now we're even.
We are so watching The Lion King.
-You're gonna cry. You'll see. -Guys don't cry.
Everyone cries during The Lion King. Everyone.
I love this song.
Weird they'd play it here.
-Why weird? -Come.
No way. Nope.
-Come on. -Guys don't dance.
-Jeez, do guys do anything? -Pola…
-Don't make me do this. -Please.
Please…
-I can't dance. -I'll teach you.
-God, this is social suicide. -Nah.
Sorry I'm late.
He's not here yet?
Relax.
He'll be here soon.
Where the fuck is he?!
He'll be here soon.
-I don't like bitches. -So you won't like each other.
Hey, smart-mouth. Go fuck yourself.
Hey, you!
S'up, Brownie?
Excuse me.
It's 10 p.m. This is the evening news.
Another ethnicity-based attack in Białystok…
Turn it up.
…beaten up by unknown attackers.
He is hospitalized in critical condition.
The victim is a 35-year-old Italian citizen.
Fuck.
To the hospital!
Aren't we waiting for the Italian dude?
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
Our Italian. Bastards.
Where were the police?
Gentlemen, do you know what this means?
This is the end of our plan.
Operation code name "Blow up the synagogue"
is called off.
We really have to work on the code names.
A man…
chases his dreams, wants to do something good for the world…
but no…
Right. I need a puff.
Is this a 24/7 hospital?
Come, let's see if they sell smokes.
NURSES ROOM
Excuse me. Staszek.
-Hi. -Hi.
Jeez, it's awful.
-I came as soon as I heard. -So did we.
The entire Białystok Against Violence Association.
ANTI-FASCISM
He doesn't understand what's happened. Racial prejudice is abstract to him.
Where were the police?
I know you from somewhere.
Impossible. Pola, let's go. He has to rest.
I'll walk you home.
-I never forget a face. -A match? Staszek used to play soccer.
No, that's not it.
Wait, I know!
You work at the parking lot.
Yeah, the parking lot.
I never forget a face.
Staszek, you don't understand. It's a serious problem.
The worst part is that it'll only get worse.
As a country, we need a new, comprehensive strategy.
-We need Citizenship Education programs. -Yeah.
Existing laws must be thoroughly analyzed.
Do they provide the police and prosecutors the means to fight all these criminals?
-This is so messed up. -Hold on, Pola.
This is too much for me, I…
Hey, easy. He'll come out of it, Staszek.
It's not about him.
I don't know how to say this. It's all fucked up.
I think one thing, but do the other.
Like I don't have my own opinion.
-I've felt like trash my whole life. -You're not trash.
Stachu, most men I've met are hypocrites.
But there's something about you…
that's damn real.
Jeez.
Pola, I made a mistake.
You mean us?
-I wanna tell you something, but I don't-- -Me too.
What about the propaganda?
Jews own all of Hollywood, right?
But Islamists? Jack shit. Bollywood.
Not now, Brajanisław. I'm not in the mood.
Don't sweat it, big guy.
That synagogue
was beneath you.
Bro,
don't you fucking get it?
This is the end of RYS. Didn't you see Roman crying like a pansy?
Fuck!
I can't focus on my kebab with that "fafalaha fafaman."
Turn it down, Turk.
Turk!
Turn it down, you're not at home!
Didn't you fucking hear me? Turn it down! You're not at home!
Where do you think I am then?
In Poland!
-Fucking take that! -What?
Get the fuck up! Get up!
Hi.
Staszek! Where are you?
At home.
Come to the kebab shop!
-White Poland… -Roman.
…Catholic…
Listen, I don't think this is for me. I…
If I ever was a member of RYS, I'm out now. Sorry.
What?!
Staszek, we're carrying out a coup at the kebab shop.
The Turks stabbed Mieszko with a knife!
What?
This is serious!
All members are to assemble in the t-shirts I gave you.
Fight for your brothers! Fuck, Staszek! Can I count on you?!
Fuck, Staszek! Can I count on you?!
-What the fuck is this? -Mom washed it with my stuff.
White Poland!
-Your boyfriend's going to like it. -Give me that.
White Poland!
-Democracy, freedom, equality! -Let's squash these leftist parasites!
No atheism and no rainbow! Catholic Poland, the way to go!
-Democracy, freedom, equality! -Catholic Poland, the way to go!
-White Poland! -Democracy, freedom, equality!
SYRIAN KEBAB FIRAS' FOOD
Fuck the commies! Better dead than red!
-What's this? -Don't even ask.
How's Mieszko?
-We don't know. He's in the hospital. -Fuck the commies! Better dead than red!
What a fucking mess!
Fuck the commies! Better dead than red!
-Who's got flares? -We're not scared!
Fucking flares!
Fuck the commies! Better dead than red!
Democracy, freedom…!
Better dead than red!
Fuck LGBGQ!
Roman!
STOP VIOLENCE
Pola!
Pola, listen to me.
-You son of a bitch. -I'm sorry. I really wanted to--
To do what? Seduce me and make four little fascists?
-What a plan! -I wanted to tell--
-Throwing Hitler-themed kid parties? -Sorry--
-You're a scumbag! -I tried--
The worst, Brownshirt scumbag.
-Pola, I'm really not like them. -You're not?!
Why are you wearing a "white pride" t-shirt?
Why were you at the kebab shop with them?
You're like them, Staszek! Just like them!
I can't believe I wanted to stay here!
-Fuck! I even found an apartment! -Bullshit!
-Excuse me? -Bullshit.
-You'd never move here. -What do you mean?
You say you hate hypocrisy.
-But you are a hypocrite. -I'm a hypocrite?
You moved to Warsaw and live a fantasy life!
I live a fantasy life?
You and your friends serve the Third Reich!
Maybe I am like them!
But you're like the other "them."
All you have for us is contempt, fucking patronizing and ginseng!
What fucking ginseng?
Fucking Siberian.
-You need help. -You need help! To abort your brain.
-Go to a psych ward! -Yeah? And you--
-If I wasn't handcuffed, I'd-- -What?!
I'm not fighting. It's cool.
Here.
Wait.
I don't know how your mother raised you.
-Dad-- -We'll talk at home.
I have to go back to work and listen to the jokes about my idiot son.
-But you were scared that I was gay. -Stasiek.
Only because you'd have a hard life.
Because of people like your cousin. And you.
Go home.
A pink "white pride" t-shirt. Fucking awesome trolling.
-Great idea. -It was my mom.
-Well done, Mom. -The Warsaw Equality Parade is coming up.
-Come. The more, the merrier. -Warsaw is fucked up.
-True that. -Michał's number is on there. Call him!
Take care!
New friends?
Show me.
God is watching over us, Staszek!
Mom's going to kill you.
-Why are you helping me then? -Because mom's going to kill you.
DELETE CONTACT
Can't lose a finger here. Good.
Fuck off!
Go on, in the booth.
For fuck’s sake.
Little shit.
I can't believe it.
Our Mieszko.
May he rest in peace.
What the fuck, Brajan?
-He'll be out tomorrow. -Yeah, and he needs a peaceful rest.
Nice haircut.
You're starting to get it.
Staszek, what's wrong?
Nothing. Girl problems.
Girls… are like the Red Army.
They are many,
they can't be trusted,
and they're very dangerous in winter conditions.
To cheer you up.
Oh, you…
Fuck, what is this?
The best stuff. Local.
Don't worry.
Gentlemen.
Things have taken a bad turn.
We've all had moments of crisis--
-Like when you cried? -I didn't cry.
The enemy forces are drawing upon us.
The attack on our Italian guy.
The stabbing of Mieszko.
The closures of churches in France.
Those are signs that the leftist offensive has entered its final phase.
We have to respond with double force.
How, Roman? Without the handsome Italian?
-And without Mieszko, may he rest-- -Brajan.
My cousin Staszek
is a genius.
Through subterfuge,
he managed to convince the LGGTIQ circles
that he's one of them.
Now, Staszek is going to infiltrate their ranks
and gain their trust.
All right. Don't look at me like that. I'll go with Staszek.
-Who's looking at you? -Roman, no need to ask me twice.
Time to make critical decisions. You said so, right?
If our cause demands it…
I'll bend over.
For Poland.
Twice.
All right, suit yourself. The deviants' meeting is today.
Let's begin the infiltration.
-Hiya. -Hi, come in.
Listen, everyone. Hey!
-This is… -Staszek.
Staszek, the hero of yesterday's demonstration.
-And you are? -I'm gay.
I love it. Come in, make yourselves at home.
-Hi. -Hi.
-Karina. -Mariusz.
Hi.
Mariucha.
Hiya, Mariucha.
What are we doing?
Okay.
Fucking nada.
You're right, it's amazing.
See, I told you. Seitan.
Did you know that Warsaw has the most veggie food joints in Europe?
-I didn't know that. -Okay.
Sickos.
Did you see that guy with Staszek?
Yeah. I don't get why he's with him. Staszek's fit, has a pretty face…
And that meathead? Is it the '90s? Dolph Lundgren?
What the--
-What are you doing here? -What?
I'm looking for HIV drugs.
Are you sick?
Listen the fuck up.
You're the one's who are sick.
Tough day?
The other guys pissed me off.
Men, bro.
Who can understand them?
Fuck those assholes.
Fuck 'em.
Everyone, listen up! Can I have your attention?
I have great news.
Due to the recent events in our city,
the organizers of the Warsaw Equality Parade have just decided
that our squad will have its own platform at this year's parade!
They're inviting us to the platform.
Excellent!
We're going to the parade!
Why did they want to meet here?
I don't know, Roman, but these guys mean business.
They're here.
Relax, they're my soccer homies.
S'up, Carp!
Why the fuck did you choose this shithole?
Carp, I'd like you to meet Roman, Leader of RYS and my friend.
Commander.
Cool tattoo. Where'd you get it?
You got business with us?
Or you want to complement our looks?
We have business.
I think we'll all agree that we have a problem with pansies.
You hear that, Beast? He has a problem with pansies.
No, not like that. Roman handles pansies like…
a smooth operator.
The thing is
we're planning an attack.
-On the pride parade. -But hush-hush. It's a secret.
Yes, and we want to get in touch
with the Russian mafia.
Did you hear that?
Hitler's birthday wafer boys are thugs now.
They'll surprise the pansies and jump out of a cake.
Or, wait for it,
I had a good one--
Shut up!
Did you hear that, Beast?
-Say that again. -No…
Enough of this, for fuck's sake!
You hate leftists and deviants.
You know it's a plague that is destroying our nation.
And what do you do about it? Nothing!
You only have enough balls to put up banners at soccer games!
But we,
we are ready to do whatever it takes.
And we will do whatever it takes to heal this country!
And we won't be stopped by your squad or the police.
Not even by God Almighty in the Holy Trinity himself!
Now give me your contact list.
How does it go?
There was trembling in the air
On a hot summer day
I don't know how I caught your trail
On a hot summer day
And that was when I first met you
On a hot summer day
I knew you liked me too
On a hot summer day
On a hot summer day
On a hot summer day
There were shooting stars in the sky
On a hot summer day
We managed to stop the time…
Did you know
that being wounded with a kebab knife
you might've caught Islam?
Very funny, Brajanisław.
We have to fill up.
Not here.
That's an Israeli company.
Nope.
They support LDGL.
Here?
At a German gas station?
Fuck.
Now what?
Nothing.
You go.
All right then.
-You win. -Fine, I'll go.
Poland is beautiful, isn't it?
Hey!
Welcome, gentlemen.
-Glory… -To Great Poland.
How are you, lunatic? Or should I say, Deputy Minister?
One does not exclude the other.
-Counter-demonstration? -Yup.
-That'll burn? -Yup.
I must say, I kind of miss the old times, throwing cobblestones.
So many beautiful memories.
-Fuck it. Quid pro quo, right? -Yeah.
Romek, you have a room in my name. It's top-notch. Hi, guys.
-Thanks. -See ya.
How do you know him?
He's an old buddy, back from the Youth Movement.
He was mental! And now?
There you go.
-Come in! -Come in!
-Good afternoon, gentlemen. -Good afternoon.
Refreshments. On the house.
What's this?
Stones?
These are clams.
Grab some glasses.
Here.
Fucking hell!
The night before the op.
We're lying low like soldiers.
-We're out of champagne. -I'll get it.
-No! -No!
I'll go.
How did you
forget to put on your briefs?
DEATH TO THE ENEMIES OF THE FATHERLAND
Our vigil is over.
Time to sleep.
Tomorrow morning we launch operation code name
"Blowing up the gay bus which…"
You know which one.
In the morning, before people arrive.
Not quite.
Not quite…
Because?
Because we'll blow it up once they're there.
You want to kill people?
They're not people.
They're an ideology.
Have you lost your fucking minds? Tell me you're kidding.
Fuck, Roman! This wasn't the plan.
Staszek, are you the commander?
You're fucking mental. I'm off.
Staszek, snort a line. You're not thinking straight.
I've just fucking straightened up.
You're my family.
My blood.
That's why I'll say this one more time. Staszek, get a grip!
In RYS there's no place
for weakness.
We don't retreat backwards.
You can only retreat backwards.
-Not in RYS. -Hey, Roman.
What the fuck?
What's happened to you?
What are you getting me into?
Don't you think it upsets your cousin when you say stuff like that?
One person might say, "Kill the deviants," someone else, "Don't kill the deviants."
A civil discussion, no insults.
I saved your life, you ingrate.
-Fuck! Roman, it's not too-- -I've opened your eyes!
-Sit and stop embarrassing yourself! -You're the embarrassment, clown!
-We're blowing that parade the fuck up! -Look at yourself!
Who have you become, Roman?
You're a fucking old man with nothing but hatred inside.
A self-proclaimed admiral and leader!
You've hit rock bottom, and you're pulling us with you! Fuck that!
This is not fighting for your brothers. You're mentally ill.
Let me through.
Out of my fucking way.
Clock that fucking LGBTIQ-lover.
Darlings, hello! I'm happy to see you all!
LOVE IS LOVE It's great that so many of you could make it.
The parade will start in half an hour!
Have fun! You're all safe here!
You're under no threat because love is on our side!
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Call the police.
Calling Pola.
Fuck, not Pola. The police!
Hello?
What? Pola? Call the police!
RYS wants to attack the Equality Parade.
Who is this?
Staszek, for fuck's sake!
Polaris, can you explain who this Staszek is who's calling you?
No, hang up.
Just hang up.
Call the police. The police.
Stanisławix.
You talk too much.
And it's high time that we, men, stop talking and start listening.
Shut the fuck up.
Call the police. Roman has a bomb. He wants to detonate it.
Fuck, people will die. Call the police.
-He hung up. -What did he want?
Call.
Call the police.
Fuck, no.
He said something about some Roman, the parade, a bomb and…
he's in the Department of the Interior's suite.
Polaris…
Who do you hang out with?
HERO OF TOLERANCE
It's great that so many of you could make it.
The Parade will start in half an hour!
Love! Three times love!
And remember! You're all safe here…
BIAŁYSTOK SUPPORTS LGBTQIA+
…because love is on our side!
An attack on the Equality Parade?
Ma'am, I don't know why people flaunt about what they do in bed,
but this is the 12th call today about a bomb at the parade.
Sir, I'm not kidding. They'll blow it up.
Okay, got it. Have a nice day.
Where's the Department of the Interior's suite?
-Hello. -Hello.
We're looking for five weird guys.
We have only weird ones here.
-Room 118. -Thanks!
…the octopuses and divide them.
We'll divide them into easily…
Easily fried various pieces.
So soft. It was frozen…
Where's Staszek?
-What's wrong? Need a push? -Who the fudge knows?
Darlings!
SOLIDARITY
Raise your flags! Big and small, all of them!
Warsaw is free and safe today!
So remember, and let me remind you!
-Love! -Love!
I SLEEP WITH WHO I WANT!!! Fuck.
Where's our bus?
Let's fire up our rockets and go!
Fucking deviants.
Try now!
Fucking gay bus.
Wait, I'll check the alternator!
Bro, what alternator! Terminals have oxidized.
-What terminals? -Terminals. You're all dirty.
LOVE
We can check the terminals.
Fuck.
What's up?
Staszek escaped, and he's coming for you.
What?
It was that snooping leftist girl.
Fucking hell!
How did it happen?
We grab the tongs
from underneath, like that.
A Jewish conspiracy.
Fuck!
What's up?
Here.
Find the bus and blow it up.
Now you're the brains of this operation.
And remember
the detonation code is…
…zero!
-Grunwald! -Grunwald. Where are you going?
To deal with Staszek.
Once and for all.
-Are you coming? -In a minute.
Okay.
Grunwald…
Fuck me sideways.
Gru…
"G" is a six.
Fuck, that's not it.
Fucking Grunwald.
-Hey, you. -Yeah?
-Do you know zip code for Grunwald? -Nope.
Neither do I…
Okay, thanks.
Try to get the detonator!
Stop!
-Gimme that! -Let the fuck go!
Stop! Let me go!
Calm down or I'll smack you!
Let go!
Give it back to him.
-Why didn't you detonate the bomb? -You said Grunwald, but it has digits!
-The date of the Battle of Grunwald! -You enter it.
Hold this.
People, run! They have a bomb!
Too late.
Poland is beautiful, isn't it?
Wrong date?
-Police! Hands up, now! -Hands in the air!
Hands!
Gentlemen, it's not a bomb. It's a Hindu symbol of luck.
-Relax! -Put me the fuck down!
Calm down or I'll smack you!
-Calm down! -Fuck!
Look!
I disarmed it.
We have to get this out of here.
Looking for someone?
Great fourth date.
We got them good, huh?
Come on.
Hello?
Are you packed?
Almost. You? Tell me.
Not just "you." I have a Master degree now.
Really? Okay, Master!
Thesis, "Ethnic composition of Białystok
across the centuries" defended summa cum laude.
I knew you could do it.
Gotta go. I have a train to catch. Bye!
Love you! Bye!
You really prefer to live with Pola than with me?
Come here, you little goth rebel!
Stop it!
Now,
all of this will be yours.
I understand that the defendant pleads guilty to all charges.
Moreover, he states that he acted alone, and participation of the other defendants
stemmed out of their unawareness caused by the defendant's manipulation.
Therefore, the defendant wishes to take all the blame on himself
because he was, as he put it, "the brains of the operation."
Does the defendant agree?
-Sure do. -Excuse me?
Yes, Your Honor.
All right, I hereby officially open the staff meeting of a new force.
The Polish Youth.
Now, the first order of business.
The rector complains
that someone's been stealing soap from the bathroom.
Fucking hell, Krystian. Do you know anything about that?
Wojtas…
I mean,
Deputy Minister.
It's Minister, now.
A Deputy Minister
is someone I need.
Me?
All that happened doesn't matter?
Youthful indiscretions.
[in Danish, crying] I can't…
[in English] This is not a making of…
but more of an insight
on how the Cowboy fell asleep and woke up in Copenhagen.
[man, in Danish] Three, two, one… Go!
I would describe Copenhagen Cowboy as fantasy, horror and adventurous.
The name already tells something.
It's a… [chuckles]
You cannot find words to make sense of Copenhagen Cowboy. What is it?
You know, Copenhagen, modern city.
And cowboy from old western style.
How do you combine those two things together?
It's already amazing there.
I think it's very colorful, very potent,
and very raw at the same time.
And we definitely, kind of, have horror elements and fairy tale elements.
The original pitch was,
I'm going to do an extension of the Pusher trilogy.
And everyone said, "Great, let's go do it."
But there was going to be a spaceship.
I would say the story of Copenhagen Cowboy,
on paper, was about a young woman
who transforms through a series to become a superhero.
It's like this, well, fairy tale-like
underworld of Copenhagen or Denmark.
It's certainly not the Denmark we know.
-[Algren] No. -It's a world that transcends realism.
[Algren] This is Miu's world.
So you are brought along and down deep
into the underworld of Denmark through Miu's journey.
[Refn, in Danish] Sit up there. And the table…
We'll get a small chair for you. Didn't you have a similar one?
[in English] I thought it could be fun, if I had come back to Denmark,
I would create, like, a fairy tale narrative.
So I hired a great group of female writers.
I think the reason why we looked at fairy tales,
and Greek mythology, and Shakespearean dramas
might be because they all have this concept of fate,
because we wanted with Miu to also have this feeling of…
there is an element of fate.
-Mm. -That she was born to do something.
-Mm. -Um, if she was even born.
[woman, in Danish] Where do you come from?
[in Danish] That's a long story.
[in English] I started with first, the title.
I said "Cowboy,"
and then "Copenhagen."
And those became "CC."
It was like two contrasting components together,
but they flowed very well on the tongue,
and it became enigmatic of what it actually was,
which was exciting to me.
What would I make that my kids would find interesting?
And that became Miu.
I wanted to resurrect the kind of alter ego that I had created with,
you know, Mads Mikkelsen and Ryan Gosling,
and Vithaya on my previous films to create a show,
a character that was an extension of myself.
But as a young woman would reflect more
of a role model for my children.
And I knew that the protagonist of the show
had to start off as a young woman.
And there's definitely a need for these female heroes.
And we had an ongoing discussion about that.
Um, and it's like when you create this kind of character,
um, who's mysterious and very driven,
and might use violence to attain his or her goals.
If it's a man, I guess we easily accept that,
and don't ask that many questions.
But when it's a female, we're like,
oh, what's, like, the psychological explanation?
What traumas did she go through to become like that?
And we kind of wanted to challenge these limitations
of the female hero, and what she could be like.
[Algren] That was also Jang's, kind of, concept of a cowboy.
He was very much challenging, also, our views on a female character
having a backstory and everything, and he was like,
"This is a cowboy just entering the scene,
arriving at a new town and doing his thing."
-And that was super cool… -Yeah.
…to explore with her.
Miu is sort of… She's just a very physical person.
It's very much a state to be in, in Miu.
You have to stay in that state.
It's almost like you're sleeping, and it's like she doesn't speak so much.
She stands.
She observes a lot, and then she moves.
And so, it fits a lot to be
in sort of that between state.
I'm very there, but I'm also in another place.
Well, I'm a very superstitious person.
And I have contacts with extraterrestrials through my work,
that I regularly speak with.
So it was very natural for me to bring that into the process.
I always knew that the Miu character
and her so-called sister, Rakel,
would essentially come from another dimension.
I just had to figure out how I interpreted it into the story.
I really like and I really respect Jang's choice to do a lot of,
what would you call it, maybe like street casting,
or just to take people in who are pure and natural in some sense,
because they're just who they are.
They're not actors.
The way I would cast it was, one of the few elements that I took
from my Pusher trilogy, where I would cast,
you know, reality,
or seek outwards to find more.
What I found interesting, most of the time, they were untouched.
They were pure. They were original.
People who are really from the different environments, you know,
standing actually in front of the real deal.
You have the real…
uh, like, the people who know the real environments,
but it's also a fairy tale where they're a little bit twisted,
and I think that makes it even more interesting
than if it had just been one to one.
[in Danish] Bang! That's the first one.
Here.
Bang!
And then again. Without you knowing it.
But you have got used to it. So it doesn't matter.
-The last one is just… -[man] Are you ready?
Yes, that's good.
[in English] I was street casted for Pusher 3.
And then I begin to act, and there was more of it.
And I feel like, you know, I found something that I love to do.
The way that he made it, that he street casted people,
he got something original.
If you play a role that is near to the personality that you have,
then, of course, it's easier for you to play it.
But he was very good at, uh…
As in when we started, he was really, you know, like,
"Hey, Dan, you know, you don't have to show me
all these TV things you have learned, you know.
I want you to be yourself, cool and relaxed."
And then after that, I was, yeah, you know, I feel good.
And I found my character.
He told me that…
He said, "Hey, Dan, you are good at this shit."
I think, Jang, he was opening up my eyes,
and I was like, "Hey, man, maybe I am. Maybe he's right. Maybe I'm good at this."
So he was changing my life, yeah.
Since I was a child, I was fighting for my life, you know, by myself.
Every day I came from school, I have a lot of bruises in my face.
My pants was destroyed.
But I didn't want to tell my mom,
so she thought
I was maybe too wild, you know.
When I'm 14 years, I was living on the street.
In the school break, I didn't want to go out,
because I knew outside there was
a queue of people that wanted to fight me.
I saw a Bruce Lee movie.
From that day, I knew what I'm going to do.
I do all this kicking because I saw this on the movie,
I exercised every day, you know.
I never think I'm going to be a big movie star.
It's like…
It was a dream, you know. It feels good.
Now I can be my own Bruce Lee.
When I met Jason, the only thing I thought,
"My God, he was built for cinema with that face."
He was like a beautiful version of Quasimodo.
And he had these techniques
of fighting and brutality like a panther.
And yet, he was gentle and kind, like a butterfly.
And that combination already kind of, you can say,
he created the character of Mr. Chiang right in front of me.
And I just followed along the way.
I just looked back and then played myself when I was young.
I've always had an open mindset on putting all my chips on something new.
So, yeah, it's not the first time that I just went out and did something mad
that I didn't know anything about,
but I just wanted to go 100% on it.
I got the opportunity to try out
playing as an actor with my role, Nicklas.
And at that time, I really did not enjoy where I was.
So I decided to say "Fuck it," and just go.
Within two weeks or something like that,
I've gotten the job and started filming.
So, it was a quick decision of just saying yes and just trying it out.
[in Danish] All the girls…
The nice girls in the bar,
they want you,
and they want to be eaten by fucking Nicklas.
[in English] He had that incredible face, so it was automatically him.
There was an enormous amount of locked up emotions
that I think could be channeled in a very effective and inspiring way
through creativity, which is certainly what acting is.
It's a creative process.
It's been absolutely incredible.
It's been a very fun experience, so it's been giving me a lot of good times
that I will remember for the rest of my life.
[in Danish] Here, a cut to this,
where she is kicking him away,
and then kicks him over.
[Jørgensen] Thank you, all,
for this great experience and cooperation.
[in English] We did have some meetings in the writers' room,
with some of these actors who had the real life experiences,
who could also correct certain scenes or dialogues
where they would use different words.
[in Danish] Bang, bang, bang! And then you turn around.
From there you can…
[in English] I have no acting experience whatsoever.
It was the second casting, and she was like, "Yeah, don't hold back."
And I was like, "Are you sure?"
And she was like, "Yeah, just give me all you got." [chuckles]
And I was like, "All right."
And then she started… She asked me something.
And I was like, "Yeah!"
And I was really shouting my lungs out.
And after… I looked at her, and she was so calm, she was like,
"You did good." [chuckles]
When I read the script, I think I am Mother Hulda.
I just got the feeling.
I have to practice because I was not educated like an actor.
I don't have the education in this branch.
I am also a single mum to a son.
So I got that feeling, "Okay, if my son was taken away,
how do I feel?"
So the tears just came out. So I got the feeling that I can play her.
I think I understand her.
I met Nicolas the first time in the summer of '95.
It was the casting for Pusher.
We start to talk very openly,
stuff like the street life,
the dope experience, and immigrants, milieu.
So, this moment when I met Nicolas,
it was important for me in my life.
[Refn, in Danish] Zlatko knows that. He's very experienced.
[in English] We have a past, me and Zlatko.
All right.
[in Danish] But you're a lucky coin.
[in English] I don't thrive on taking a chance on people,
but I know that if you can come in a situation
where performers that have not a lot of experience with them,
to let their guards down and be 100% themselves,
you mostly touch magic.
My dad is a weird dude.
He thinks in film.
He has his work and he has his family.
We are a team, in a way.
He was very much dependent on me, because otherwise, he couldn't go away
and work for ten months and do Drive, or…
So it's been like a collaboration, in a way.
Like, how do we do this?
Like, for instance, with Only God Forgives,
we moved to Bangkok for six months, and Lola went to school there and like…
He's a very family-oriented guy.
But, you know, Liv has just been reading the scripts,
and me and my sister have been kind of not really involved
with what his work has been up to.
So I think he's always used to looking outwards
and finding people outside of his family,
compared to this time, where he kind of looked inward
and saw what the family could do.
You know, even my sister is participating in the show.
So I think that's also kind of a fun little family trip.
[Liv] I just feel like I'm always a part of his work, in a way,
even though I'm not always
on the set every day.
Then the whole developing of the scripts he talked to me about,
like, maybe a character, or I read the scripts.
I mean, it's always nice to film with someone that you're close to
and have a good relationship with.
But sometimes I'm like, "I got this.
I can do this on my own, you know.
You don't need to be screaming in my ear."
But you know, it helps with her anger coming out.
So I guess it works both ways.
[in Danish] More!
And… Scream!
That was really good, honey.
That was good. We'll take it one more time, angry again.
[in English] I never thought it was going to be her.
It wasn't so much on my radar.
But as I had the idea for the character very late in the process,
we were almost near the end of shooting…
And there had been a coffin on set in Nicklas's estate,
that I thought was a really cool prop, and I kept on bringing it back
every time we were shooting there, until one day I was like,
"Maybe we should put somebody in the coffin."
"What if he has a sister?"
No, it should be a stepsister, because then we can have
more interpretation, because she's actually part of the Miu world.
And that got the ball rolling.
And so, we were casting, and I wasn't necessarily
getting what I was looking for outwards,
until I think Liv said, "Well, maybe it's because
it's right in front of you, if you really think about it."
And obviously casting your family members is an intimate process.
What if it doesn't work?
So I tricked her by casting her without her knowing it,
while she was doing homework,
because she was in her finals in high school.
And he came in one day,
and since my mom had been helping on the show,
I just thought he wanted my help to see an outside view of someone
who does… have no idea what's going on.
I went out to the kitchen.
I said, "Can you please say these lines?"
And she's like, "Why?"
I say, "Can you say the goddamn lines?"
She's like, "Why?" I said, "Just say the lines."
And she's like, "Fine, I'll say the lines."
And I acted out a couple of lines, which was Rakel's lines.
And he was like, "Great, thanks." And I was like, "You're welcome."
And she said it with such conviction, and clarity, and natural… that I was like,
maybe, in a way, I had already created Rakel as a kind of rebellious version
of what I had at home, which was a 19-year-old daughter.
And the next day he was like,
"Well, you know, I really liked you for the part."
"Would you want to play her?"
And I was like, "Sure, why not?"
"See what happens."
I'm a fetish personality.
I like fetish.
I like detail. I like attention to detail.
And fashion is part of that.
Fashion is also… You know, revolutionary fashion is an extension.
Fashion is a mirror into who you are.
Yeah, Miu is very much wearing a sort of a suit,
sort of an armor for her.
Nicolas was very clear from the beginning that he wanted a tracksuit.
It's something everyone is familiar with.
It's armor, in a way. It's a piece of utility clothing.
It's built to last, built to be durable, um, built to withstand the elements.
But mainly the protective aspect of it, I thought was very interesting.
I think I took a few more risks, or a lot more risks this time,
because it's very diverse.
Generally, just researching women throughout history
who have in some ways been fighting
on the path of right, if you like.
Almost like, it's a kind of quest.
So I found looking at Joan of Arc quite helpful,
in how she looked with the short hair and the armor that she wore.
And tried to adapt that into sportswear
or something that could also be perceived
in a contemporary situation, like a coat, or a puffer vest,
or a track suit.
Normally, we didn't plan very much. It was very much working as a process.
Developing as the script would develop and change, we would adjust.
We ended up doing a big flower makeup
for a dream sequence that Miu had.
We've been shooting in this mansion house,
and there was all these beautiful flowers that we used on set.
And the set designer was taking them away
and they were standing outside,
and I just thought, "Do you mind if I grab some of these flowers?
I'd like to… I don't know what I'm going to use them for,
but I'm just going to put them in my William Blake book."
Then one day, Nicolas asked me,
"Can you make Miu into some sort of demon?
She's having this dream sequence,
and she's standing up against this wallpaper with flowers.
Maybe you can be inspired by that."
Everyone knows he's obsessed with movies.
I don't think that's a secret, and his brain just never stops.
So when we're in the car, and even on set, he plays music.
And he plays different music to get different feelings
out of the different characters,
and I think music is a big part of him relaxing and being able to think.
Music is, you know, heals and it inspires.
By choosing a piece of music for a specific day or a scene,
not just helps the actors, but it helps the crew.
It helps the cameraman.
It helps the designers.
It helps the make-up.
It helps everyone.
I could also sense that sometimes if I would lose it,
then Jang would just know that he has to play a song
to remind those senses.
He quickly found out that I am very fond of classical music.
So we've been listening to quite a lot of classical music to set me in the mood.
And I react quite a lot to music.
And so that's been very helpful to set me in a very grim mood.
Since it's my first acting job,
it was fairly new to me, but I actually really like it.
Now, I don't think I can do without it.
Because it kind of… I mean, it depends what you play,
but it, you know, kind of, gets different feelings out in you.
So we would play a lot of music, and it would either be kind of
horror-themed music, or if it was like a sad scene,
or something else to kind of ease you
to get in the mood, to make your feelings move a little bit.
[in Danish] You've been a naughty boy.
[in English] Nicolas is good at painting you a picture before you start the music.
And sometimes, he'll have two things that are at odds with each other,
and that's exciting,
because something happens there.
He can mention a group and then a movie,
and these two things have nothing to do with each other.
You get something that's never heard before.
We don't score characters.
We do it by shapes and colors.
You score the darkness and you score the light.
And sometimes, you score a little light in the darkness.
Whenever I'm done with something, I exorcise it from my existence.
And it kind of no longer really exists anymore.
I LIKE YOU, JUNE. I LIKE YOU, JUNE.
I LIKE YOU, JUNE.
I like you too, Phing.
Destiny.
Actually, the movie can end now.
But the thing is, Phing is an extra.
Not the main male lead.
The main lead is standing like a buffoon over there.
His name is Guy.
But before the story starts, let's get to know the main female lead.
June… has lots of followers.
She was a cheerleader in her first year.
She was in the Angels Squad.
Soon, the group fell out because of biological reasons.
Most of the girls
don't really like her.
FAKE! ANNOYINGGGG!
During the second and third year, Guy didn't really know her in particular.
The two were always bumping into each other.
Excuse me,
do you have any coins I can borrow?
Sure.
I do…
have a coin.
Thanks.
Until one day.
A magic moment…
floated by.
A ship was made.
My hand was under yours.
But now it's not, is it?
-Here. -Thank you.
Hey.
I've never thought of you to be someone like this.
Like what?
Greedy.
But we can't equally be at fault.
You're more at fault than me.
Because I got 450,
and you got 500 plus boba tea.
Oh, this is to silence me.
Fine. I won't tell anyone then.
Promise?
I thought you wanted to pinky swear.
I'm going.
Hey, Guy. I need your advice.
I'm interested in this girl. Give me a pick-up line.
Phing. Are you a high schooler?
I haven't seen anyone ever confess their love successfully yet.
It's usually casually talking and then becoming an item.
I don't know. I'm impatient.
I just want to try my luck.
Uh…
then try this.
Walk over to her.
Don't say anything.
But send her a text telling her you like her
in front of her.
Sounds good?
Damn.
That's awesome!
You know I'm joking, right?
Your mind is anti-anti social network, huh?
I know you're deep.
Thanks a lot, bro.
Sure.
Guy didn't understand
why that worked.
Guy was disappointed that his best friend stole his shot.
But the joke is on Phing
because Guy knows that Phing never carries an umbrella on him.
And this is the beginning of the story.
After this, Guy will like June more and--
Damn you, voice over!
Stop narrating.
Are you God or what?
Sure.
I don't really like the movie The Classic
Because the creator Is mean to the characters
Oh, Tah, you came as well?
Hi, Master Guy.
-Yes, I came. -Are you doing well?
Oh, I told June
that you're my Master.
You came up with that pick-up line.
You're quite sappy.
I'll take a course with you some time, Master.
And how did you become a Master?
June.
Is this sexual harassment?
Let's talk about something else.
Guy has three siblings.
And they like to teach him how to get girls. Wow.
Hey! Awesome.
What did they teach you?
Tell me.
Pretty please.
Offer food to girls first.
Actually, just the first two bites is enough.
She'll then say…
-"Oh, it's fine." -It's fine.
-"Eat up." -Eat up.
That's so true!
If someone puts food on my plate, that's what I'd say, too.
GREETINGS.
Don't type "Greetings," "You're up late," "What are you doing?" "Have you eaten?"
Also, don't ask yes/no questions.
HEY, WERE YOU IN THIS SERIES?
CRAZY! THAT'S AN ACTRESS
ARE YOU FREE THIS SATURDAY?
Want to go?
Go where?
Oie. Go anywhere!
Eat, watch a movie.
A bit more special, the aquarium?
The aquarium?
That's so meh.
Then smoke a joint before going.
Hey, what are you doing?
Writing on her hand.
-Why? -Because I like her.
I want to prank her like you told me.
And what are you gonna write?
"Stupid."
No. She just fell asleep while studying,
you can't call her stupid.
She might be good at other things.
What about…
"black out"?
No one uses words like black, short, fat, skinny anymore.
DEAD
All right?
Umm…
Can we?
Or not?
But…
it should be fine.
Wow. That's so awesome.
It makes me want to have some siblings as well.
Actually, not everything can be used.
I've been talking with someone for a while now.
It's not working out.
Actually, there's a way to check
what the other person is feeling.
I've seen flirts do this often.
Let's say you're crossing a road.
Usually, people will tug at your shirt, right?
But when you're closer,
you touch their shoulder…
arm…
And… next their hand?
Wrong.
If you grab their hand and they're not into you, it's game over.
I think this spot is better.
It's between intentional or not.
It's a sensitive spot.
It's what they call the death spot.
Well.
If you do it and they don't recoil,
then it means you can continue on.
But you have to do it naturally.
If not, you'll be accused of sexual harassment.
June. Tah lost.
Your turn.
Give it a try.
Damn. This isn't right, huh?
No. June's got the short end of the stick.
She chose Phing.
Hey.
I mean Phing's in a fix.
Don't you know what people are saying about June?
About?
They're saying June is a slut.
She's a flirt and changes guys often.
-Oops. -See?
-Sorry. -It's okay.
-Isn't she just friendly? -No!
I'm confused why Phing calls you Master.
Listen to what our classmates are saying.
-Phing… -Really?
What are y'all talking about?
Gossiping about me?
Uh, we're talking about…
-Religion. -Politics.
Crypto-currency.
Shit.
You're so damn smooth, bro.
Guy, you're also quite funny.
See?
We're not even done talking.
What a bitch.
Right, bro?
You're a goner.
"Guy…
you're also quite funny."
Stop it.
That's your friend's girl.
I put on two different sides
and totally different colors.
And you know who told me?
The motorbike taxi driver.
And like,
that was so embarrassing.
Oh, I just knew today that you're quite funny.
It's green.
What do you want to eat?
I don't know.
Hey. Can we sit with you?
Sure.
-What time do you get out today? -Five. You?
I'm done at six.
Then, let's watch a movie at seven?
Okay.
Hey.
Why didn't you wait to eat together?
Well, you didn't tell me.
Do I really need to?
I'll wait for you next time, then.
Yeah.
See? You're sarcastic again.
Always being sarcastic.
Like I said, next time I'll wait.
Where are you going?
Sit.
Phing, can you stop being a jerk?
Jerk?
Am I a jerk?
Really?
Yup.
I'm a jerk.
Let's just break up then.
Huh?
Just like that?
I'm sorry.
I'm always putting my foot in my mouth.
Huh? Together again?
And what am I supposed to feel?
I told you that I'm not like that.
I know you're not but… how am I supposed to trust you?
I've missed you.
I'm sorry.
-Stop being a jerk! -I'm not a jerk. You're a brat!
What the hell? Am I not enough for you?
They're not gonna make it.
Let's not be like them.
Let me in, Lex.
June!
June.
I know I'm being a broken record.
But I really want to change.
I think if I'm with you…
I can be a better version of me.
Let me in, please.
-I was explaining it to you! -What?
-What the hell are you trying to explain? -You've never trusted me, right?
From what I saw, I can't trust you anymore.
Then do you want to break up? Let's do it.
Just say it.
Say it.
I'm not breaking up!
Shit.
You're thinking I'm stupid, right?
Well, you're not stupid.
You're just…
a masochist.
I just found out that…
when he's with you, he's like this.
What the hell's wrong with him?
Always breaking up.
Or should I really just call it quits?
Hey.
I'm not giving out pointers, but…
it depends, do you like to cry or not?
You're so sharp, Mr. Knife.
Your sharp words have dried my tears up, see?
By the way, this is called giving pointers.
Hey, I mean it.
I'm not good at consoling people.
Well.
And…
why don't you ask your friends for advice?
I did used to ask Lex for advice.
But instead she told me off.
She's easily irritable.
Then ask someone else.
Hey…
don't tell me…
you don't have any friends at all?
This is so unfair.
I really don't understand.
"I change guys often"?
I've only had two boyfriends.
If I don't say anything, then I become a snob.
But if I'm friendly, they say I'm a slut.
I know the guys who befriend me don't want to be friends.
What am I supposed to do?
I don't have any friends.
No one wants to be my friend!
Am I supposed to be careful of what I say with everyone?
Why doesn't anyone blame the guys?
Guy…
how did you let it get to this point?
I'll start being a study bug then.
I'm going to focus only on my studies.
Hey June, what's stuck on your tooth?
You're as hideous as a monkey.
So damn ugly.
Oie.
The gods at home.
At the university.
Buddha statues. Scriptures. Monks. Anything. Send some help please.
What?
Cockroach.
Shit!
Shit, on my head?
Damn! Guy, aren't you afraid?
Where is it? There?
Scooch in.
HANDSOME.
YOUR BROTHER?
Tah.
Has Guy ever done anything lame?
Like seriously stupid?
A PERSON OR A DOG?
THAT'S ENOUGH.
MY PHONE CRASHED.
Well…
I think I'm someone who's not good at anything.
I don't have a clue what I'm going to do after graduation.
Like, there's nothing I want to do.
Or anything I'm especially good at.
It's so damn sad.
For me, I don't think so.
My older sister is like you.
She's constantly changing her job.
But she seems happy trying out this and that.
Give it a try.
Like a reviewer.
What about you?
Why do you want to be a director?
I want to tell stories that can change people's thoughts.
-Like-- -Fake.
I heard a podcast explaining that these answers are fake.
Answer what you really think.
You don't need to be cool.
I want to have sex with celebrities.
That's how you do it!
Hey, you.
Sorry.
June's friend, right?
Come here. Don't go in just yet.
Look there.
Their chemistry is just right.
Cute.
I mean you.
Cute, my ass! I'm not some joke.
Guy.
Should we join?
Oh, never mind.
People are gonna talk.
Let's just stay put.
Then let's go in…
and stand apart?
Like we came separately.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Look there. They really did break up.
I heard June cheated with someone.
Can she really not stop herself? Don't you think?
Let's…
stay out of her business.
Why does it seem like you're protecting her?
Hey, I'm not protecting her.
It's not like we know what the truth is. Right?
But Phing's the one who told me.
Patty, let's break up.
I'm really sorry.
But I want to be honest about my feelings.
I don't think I really feel anything towards you.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
DO YOU LIKE JUNE?
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?
Guy!
Phing already broke up with June.
Stupefied. Plain stunned.
Damn it.
Fake news.
Shit!
What the hell?
Hey!
-What's up, Tah? -Guy, I just met Phing.
Phing and June--
SMOKING UPSTAIRS
Can I have a cigarette?
Jerk, buy it yourself next time.
Thanks.
Excuse me. Can I borrow your lighter?
Nah. The conversation will run out quick.
Inside is kinda loud, huh?
What are you doing out here alone?
Nah. She'll wonder what's with the question.
Smoking, of course.
If the answers are locked like that,
then I'll have to attack.
Careful, you'll get cancer.
Don't forget to remind yourself as well.
But what if it's a dud?
Sorry if that was lame.
But can you give me your opinion?
If you were to rate that pick-up line,
what would you give it?
Okay, that's possible.
Inside is kinda loud, huh?
What are you doing out here alone?
Farting.
Can I borrow your lighter?
I'm not really smoking.
I'm just here to fart.
Excuse me.
Sorry. Sorry for laughing,
but damn, that was really something, Master Guy.
Oie.
Hey, I'm sorry.
Are you mad?
I'll treat you to a round of beer.
That's enough, universe.
If I can escape from this, tomorrow I'll go to temple for you.
Hey!
You cut me off!
All right. Thanks for today.
Pete & Friends is really glad to be here.
Hey, I like this song.
Were you born in time?
YouTube,
Joox, Spotify,
Apple Music.
Yeah.
You have good taste.
What's with the compliment?
I like your friend, Lex.
-Huh? -A lot.
Help me out, will you?
Lex might be a bit shy.
That's how women are. Right?
Huh, talking to the wall.
What's on your mind? Do you need to fart?
-June. -What?
What do you mean by fart?
Well, just a while ago--
Well, at least I took my shot.
What do those who wait around know?
Have you ever taken a shot?
Hold it.
What are you mad about?
Stop blowing your own horn.
If you know what to do,
then you wouldn't have chosen Phing.
Why wouldn't I know how?
Do you want me to show you?
If you're the big shot, get the number of that guy.
I'll bet five baht you can't get it.
Make it 500.
Deal.
Can't you piece it together why June's here by herself?
Huh?
I called you to tell you Phing and June have broken up.
-Like they really are done. -They'll just get back together again.
And when you called, why the hell did you start with "I met Phing"? You should've jumped straight to the details,
with "I met Phing"? You should've jumped straight to the details,
that June and Phing are already over. Crack-head!
Hello, bro. Listen to me.
It's called introducing the topic. Would most people start the conversation
off the bat with something like, "Hello, Phing has broken up with June"? No!
I would have to start with, "Hello, I met Phing."
And then I asked him where June was. Phing looked really hurt.
And that's when I tell you Phing told me he and June have broken up. Right?
That's what normal people would do.
Damn, that really just made sense.
Such an idiot.
He didn't give it to me.
I was joking. Just for laughs.
Bye, bro.
June, bye.
You don't have to walk me home.
I can walk by myself.
My dorm is on the way.
Damn!
What?
Damn it, my shoe! Where?
-Damn, my shoes! -Hey.
Where? Here?
June, you don't have to.
I'll find it myself.
Here!
I found it.
Nope.
Hey, it's fine.
I'll take this one.
There's no way we'll find it.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Get back safely.
Oh, wait.
Never mind.
I forgot.
Thanks for walking with me.
Umm.
Bye.
What's up, Tah?
It's cupid, bro.
Did you see my present in your bag?
Excuse me.
I FOUND YOUR KEYS.
THANKS. SOMEONE ALREADY LET ME IN.
I'LL GET THEM FROM YOU AT THE UNIVERSITY.
Uh…
Thanks again.
No worries.
Excuse me.
Were you able to make your friend jealous?
I like guys, sweetie.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Well,
you don't have to give me your real number.
Give me a fake one.
I just want to make my friend jealous.
-My friend's sitting over there. -Oh.
This is not my kind of thing.
Go and play at home.
Kiddie.
No.
I guessed wrong.
He wasn't jealous at all.
You shouldn't feel bad about it. Because…
your friend looks kind of perverted.
I think he's okay.
No?
Umm.
I'm Pete.
-Actually, we've met before. -I'm sorry.
You stabbed me with the billiard's stick.
I remember now.
Yup.
See you around.
For this song…
start with the snare.
Okay?
I might not sing this song so well.
Can I ask for the person who requested it,
please come up and sing with me?
Come on up.
Okay.
No need to wave. Come on up.
Hey.
Just go with it.
June is good at choosing losers.
She'll break up with him soon. Trust me.
Yeah. I'm just annoyed.
Doesn't he know that June doesn't like stuff like this?
No matter how other people are
Even if no one offers a chance
On the day you lost and made a mistake
Whatever the day is
I want you to understand
That even if no one loves you
Even if no one is interested
I want you to hang on
Don't waver
Even if the stars disappear from the sky
Even if those Who say they don't understand…
Guy.
I have some good news.
But please know one thing
I think Pete is gay.
That I love you
Pete's this guy, right?
I stalked him.
Fine-looking. Loaded. Oh? Then why's he living at the student dorm?
Jin, the dorms belong to his mom.
Owning the dorms makes him rich?
But there's another 30.
MALIGOOL MANSION, MALIGOOL COURT, MALIGOOL PLACE
He does night gigs as a hobby. He uses his own money to do his music.
He doesn't use any of his family's money. He's starting to set himself up.
His profile is great.
Just give up, Guy.
The right person at the wrong time is the wrong person.
Try listening to a podcast or meditate. You might become calmer.
Why are we interested in this middle class guy
who is infatuated with a girl who isn't even his?
Does the world revolve around your shit?
You don't have to get over being sad.
Use your hurt to do something else. Work and become well known.
-A girl will come your way. -Jin.
That's how to get over someone if you've been dumped.
Oh yeah. He wasn't even chosen.
True.
Everyone…
stop talking for a sec, will you?
I want you to comfort me.
Do I really have to ask?
-Aww. -Oh.
It's fine, puppy.
-There, there. -It's okay.
It's okay, my brother.
You'll be okay.
-Here. -Thank you.
The other day I was calm. This time I walked toward him.
-And bam! Bam! -Damn!
You're fucking awesome.
He stayed home and cried.
Lex, wait for me.
I got a matching pair of floats for us.
Should I go pick you up at around…
Hey, Guy!
-Ban floats! -Rivers are crying.
You should tell June how you really feel.
Ban floats!
Nah.
But I think you still can.
They've only started their relationship.
Nah.
That boat has sailed. Believe me.
Hey.
We're closed.
-I think you should con-- -Nah.
Buy some?
Buy some?
Why don't you egg me on any more?
Oh?
You're such a…
Shit!
Hey!
Watch out, I'll shoot you.
Happy birthday to you.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, YOU BITCH!
Happy birthday, June.
Happy birthday.
Woo-hoo!
Ah-ha.
There's someone sad.
There's someone not enjoying themselves.
June!
Guy has something to tell you.
Guy, bro!
Listen to me.
We're about to graduate.
What else do you have to lose?
TAH'S
I like you, June.
I know the timing might not be right
because you already have a boyfriend.
But I just want you to know.
And if you're not okay with it…
we don't have to mention this again.
We'll just continue to be good friends like this.
That's fine.
Damn it, Tah.
I think this is kinda lame.
Hey, Tah.
Why are you crying?
It got me.
Forward the clip.
I'll send it.
Forward.
Oh.
Damn it! Stop typing and deleting, June!
NOW ISN'T THE TIME, GUY.
SORRY FOR BEING BLUNT.
HEY, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I UNDERSTAND.
I shouldn't have made you send it.
It's all right, bro.
Thanks a lot.
I'm so relieved now. All because of you.
I'm really grateful.
Why did you drag me here? It's so hot.
I haven't eaten anything.
I'm gonna faint.
I said I'll treat you to lunch. Why are you complaining?
Okay.
Let's see how it comes out.
Let me check.
Kie. Kie.
Let's go over there.
Friend of June's.
Let's take photos together. I'll take them for you.
-Sure. -Okay. C'mon.
Tah said he'll come later and to wait for him.
Can you move a bit?
Oh, sure.
Aren't you going to look before snapping?
-I use my feelings. -Sure thing.
Is it overexposed?
No, it's not.
Are you into Top Gun these days?
Do you know how to take pictures?
I gotta fart. I'm going to the bathroom.
-See you. -Sure. Bye.
Kie.
Is that her? She's cute. Tell her you wear sunglasses because you cried all night.
Shut up.
Let's go.
TRASH / KEEP
-Have you been waiting long? -No, not at all.
-Do you want to sit up front, sonny? -I'm fine. I can sit in the back.
TRASH

Is this your girlfriend?
She looks so sweet.
If you're free, come to Lex's New Year's party.
I miss you.
I don't think I can go.
I have a lot of work to do.
I love you, Guy.
I love you too, June.
June?
Poon.
I love you, J-Poon.
June. You said June.
J-Poon.
Have a look.
It's okay.
-It's okay now, right? -Yes.
Okay, pass. It's a wrap.
Go home safely, everyone.
ARE YOU REALLY NOT COMING?
Are you really not coming?
-Hey, are you okay? -Hey!
-Hey! -Hey!
Hey, Lex.
-Don't tease. -So cool.
How are you guys?
I've missed you.
Hey, I almost couldn't recognize you.
I'll come by to chat with you.
-Oh. -Oh.
Friend of June's.
So you made it.
Umm. My work got canceled.
You still like her?
Yeah.
You have a problem with it?
-No. -Lil' Tah.
Take a photo for me.
Sure, Lil' Lex.
I'll be back, bro.
-Hand it over. -You're so sweet.
June.
How?
Badgering wins over everything else.
Good, huh? Tah finally has a girlfriend.
Really?
I shouldn't have come.
Congratulations, God.
You won.
June…
marry me?
Sure.
What a waste of time.
I feel stupid
to have thought that one day they'd break up.
It's so cliché…
to feel regret when I've lost her.
Some people like to say if they could turn back time,
they'd still do the same thing.
Saying it is cool.
But let me ask…
if you really could turn back time, would you really not change anything?
-Pete. -Huh?
Well…
Well…
I don't like things like this.
Let's go talk outside, shall we?
Sure, of course.
Damn, I want to know the ending.
Let's call and ask.
Hold up.
What right do you have to ask her?
As a friend!
Hey, what happened, June?
You can talk to me.
You're so damn nosy.
No.
She already knows you like her.
It's too obvious you want something.
Hey, do you want to audition?
I'm looking for a new face. By the way, why did you turn down Pete?
This is just freaking lame. Don't mix your personal life with work.
If you want to know, just go ahead and ask.
That's the best.
Hello, June?
June's in the shower.
Is it important?
Oh, I want to invite June to work with me.
Oh, what kind of work?
A commercial.
A model.
Oh, sure.
Uh, June's here.
It's your friend.
-Hello, June. My office is… -Oh, it's still me.
June's drying her hair.
Here.
-Hello? -Hello, June.
My office is looking for a new model.
Are you interested in working together?
For real?
I'm not really confident.
You'd get 80k. Interested?
Hey…
Of course.
Great.
Then I'll tell you the details later.
Sure.
-Is that it? -Yeah.
See you.
Stay cool.
Stay focused, Guy.
You only want to know about her, right?
That's right…
Finding work for a friend isn't wrong, right?
Right…
Okay, Guy.
You're fine.
This person is okay. She's natural. An influencer. She's got 30K followers.
Semi-popular. She's fresh. Also, unique face.
Hey, is this a dupe? Did you make a mistake?
Sorry.
Kanin.
I like her.
I've waited four years.
I've given up several times.
This is the only chance I'll get to talk with her.
If you were to take mercy on me.
There's a lot of crying. Can she cry?
She's a total crybaby.
How do you know?
I've seen her do it so many times.
Sure. Give it a try.
-Okay. -Thanks so much, Kanin.
Then I'll call and confirm with her.
Do mix your personal life with work.
LOVE THE REAR VIEW
June, listen.
More feeling.
Recall the bad things.
More, more. Give me more.
I need ten times more.
Give me some tears.
Cut!
End slate.
Guys, before the next take,
clean inside the helmet too.
Hey, June. Sorry, but…
you just need to do a bit more.
Kanin probably wants more.
-Why don't you try… -Guy, enough. I'll brief her myself.
June, right?
Did you know your acting is shitty?
Actually, this shot is really easy.
All you need to do is cry.
Why can't you do it?
You're lucky to be born with good looks.
That's why you have opportunities
more than others.
And get a chance at this job.
But if you can't do something so simple,
then you'll be left with only one thing.
Please do something to pass. The entire crew is waiting.
Thanks, Guy, for bringing your friend on board.
Your friend is such a great actor.
Cut.
What's next?
-Hey! -June!
Damn it!
June! June!
Where are you going?
June!
-Hey! -Don't run!
June!
-Let's drink something. -Calm down.
-Please wait. -I'm begging you, June.
Calm down.
It's your fault.
What am I going to tell the client?
Dad.
I don't want to stay in Thailand anymore.
Can I go live with you?
When I invited you over, you never seemed interested.
What does your boyfriend have to say? Did you tell him yet?
Not yet.
Why are you hiding out in the dressing tent?
Dad.
Then…
I'll call you later.
Okay, sweetie. Bye.
Hey. Are you sick?
I have a slight sore throat.
Oh.
Sorry for putting you through this.
What the director said was right.
Pretty but stupid.
I'm so damn useless.
Actually, being a housewife might be better.
That's right.
Back then, why did I…
turn down Pete?
Hey. But I think you did the right thing.
Marriage isn't really a bad thing, I guess.
It might be something I'm the best at.
Sometimes it can be annoying.
Why keep on repeating that you'll get married?
Why?
Why do you pretend like…
you don't know that I like you?
Are you enjoying this?
You like me?
When?
Since?
Hold up.
Um, June.
You watched my clip… didn't you?
-Clip? -The birthday clip.
-What birthday clip? -I was playing the melodeon.
Oh, I watched it. But was that a happy birthday clip?
That's right. I thought you had watched it.
It said, "read."
And you turned me down.
What?
What did I say?
Really?
You told me,
"Sorry for being blunt.
Now isn't the time."
NOW ISN'T THE TIME, GUY.
SORRY FOR BEING BLUNT.
You sent it to me at four in the morning!
It's the middle of the night.
I thought it was something important.
Instead, I saw a drunk playing a melodeon.
And it was shitty.
So, when you said, "now isn't the time…"
It's 4:00 a.m.
Was it really the time?
That means, you didn't finish watching the clip?
Do I really need to?
And why didn't you?
For what?
I confessed I liked you at the end.
What?
-Is this real? -Is this real?
Back then, I liked you too.
But I thought…
you made it clear that you just wanted to be friends.
Did I?
Yeah.
Wait.
You liked me?
Hey, June! Hold on.
Let's talk first.
June. Hey, June.
Don't follow me!
Good night, everyone.
-Bye. -Bye, June.
Hey, June. Wait up!
What the hell are you doing?
Sorry. Well, you just came out of nowhere.
Here.
No need.
Wait. June.
June.
June.
June, wait.
June. Hold on.
Oh, you're back?
-No… -Stop right there.
Thank you!
If Pete were a douchebag, everything would be easier.
Like in movies where the female leads are cheated on,
and the male lead has an excuse for it.
-Yeah, drink up. -I don't drink.
-He doesn't drink. -It's okay.
-He's a musician. Why doesn't he drink? -Here you go.
It's fine. Okay?
-I'm really sorry. -It's fine.
Polite. Why is a musician so polite?
Isn't there anything bad about him?
Please make me feel less guilty.
Stop thinking about it.
Kie, please agree.
See? Goy has agreed to do it.
It's just for fun.
This isn't any fun at all.
Secretly recording people getting pranked? You've got no taste.
It's an infringement of basic human rights.
Calm down, will you?
It sounds fun.
Plus, I get money.
Thanks, Goy.
My name's Grace.
-Just ask him for his number, right? -Yeah.
Can I take a picture with you?
Oh, sure.
Kie, move.
Hey.
Yes.
My place isn't far from here.
Damn, Pete is invincible.
What to do?
HOW TO STEAL SOMEONE'S PARTNER
Shit. This world is so crazy.
WikiHow teaches you how to steal someone's partner.
It's the first thing to come up in the search.
HOW TO STEAL SOMEONE'S PARTNER
If you can't be the better person, then be bad.
Hold up! Calm down!
Let's talk. You want money? Take it.
-I'll be the baddie for you. -Please, no!
EXHIBIT INVESTIGATION SECTION
Be more realistic.
Or start "Mission: Fake News"?
PERVERTED MUSICIAN EXPOSED!
Stop! Don't move. Read the computer law!
Or make Pete disappear?
Hey, Pong. Your pub needs a musician, right?
-Yeah, do you have a band? -I do. It's that damn Pete & Friends.
I heard them live. They're so good. Interested?
Damn, they're expensive. It's not worth it.
Hello, Ball? I heard your place needs a band, right?
Not me. I opened a car wash.
They're upcoming, bro. Pete & Friends. They're da bomb.
Tum, help my friend out, will you?
Damn you, my place is in Chiang Mai, not Bangkok. What about airfare?
Then I'll pay for half. I'll transfer it right now.
Why are you so invested?
Of course.

Wait, are you helping them build their house?
JUNE'S BIRTHDAY
But the date I booked
is an important day, Pete.
Hey, how can the plates be like that?
I wonder too, Pete. It's so funny.
You could caption this as…
"Inside is all broken.
Just open it."
What is it with men and quips?
Men?
Don't stereotype men, will you?
Since I'm leaving…
Actually, I don't have to go.
Well…
cancel it.
Then…
why didn't you tell me?
It's a joke.
I was joking.
Next time, don't say such things. I don't get it. Do you understand?
-I won't do it anymore. -Okay.
You should go.
I'm going for real now.
-Do you need a hand? -I got it.
Did you know?
I did.
-And so did you? -I did.
And why didn't anyone tell me that Guy liked me?
-You're plain stupid. -You're plain stupid.
Everyone thought you knew.
What do you think Phing and Guy fought about?
Over Patty.
Oh, shit.
I guess you could see it that way.
The main point is I'm totally shocked that you like him too.
The thing is, you didn't finish watching the clip. Damn.
Well, I didn't know it was important.
Why are you mad at me?
-I filmed it. I have the right to be mad. -Next time, make it shorter then.
Fine, my bad.
So, what's your next move?
See?
I'm engaged.
Oh, shit.
Well, he kept on badgering me.
And another thing is, so I don't stray.
Oh? Friend of June's. Where are you going? Let's go together.
-I'll have to… -Let's go. Come on.
-Birthday, birthday. -I have errands…
Let's go sing.
Hurry.
C'mon.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
You didn't think I'd come, right?
I have a present for you.
Happy birthday. Open it.
Do you like it?
Happy birthday, sweetie.
May it be filled with happiness.
Thank you.
Sorry, everyone.
I…
I have to go to work.
-I'll go now. -See you.
Bye.
Tah, are you doing well?
Yeah, I'm good.
How about you, Pete?
-I'm doing well. -Okay.
Oh, Pete.
-Can I ask you something? -Sure.
-I'm just asking. -Sure.
What if June already had a boyfriend? Would you steal her away?
Well, no.
No matter how much I like her…
I wouldn't.
I believe causing trouble for others is wrong.
Right?
You're so cool.
-Don't flatter me. -I really mean it.
Hey, are you okay?
You look a bit out of sorts.
I've been under the weather.
So I'm a bit tired.
I think I'll take a shower and go to bed.
Okay.
RELIEF OF SORE THROAT
TAH, DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT CLIP?
HERE, FINISH WATCHING IT.
I like you, June.
I know the timing might not be right
because you already have a boyfriend.
But I just want you to know.
And if you're not okay with it…
We'll just continue to be good friends like this. That's fine.
Hey, Tah.
Why are you crying?
CAN WE MEET?
Would you like to order anything else?
It's okay.
Okay.
Congratulations.
Well…
I wanted to talk to you about…
How should I put this?
I'm glad
that you like me.
But?
But…
Sorry. I really can't accept your feelings.
I… meant for today to be the last day to see you.
I want to remember us in a good way.
Let's…
move on from this.
What if I don't move on?
Don't joke around.
I'm serious.
I'm also serious.
If you really want to move on,
then you can block me.
What's the point of meeting?
You've already made your decision.
So, what do you want me to say?
If I were to be honest,
it's not that I don't think about you too.
You don't know how bad I feel
when I think of doing something
to make Pete break up with me,
or sometimes I want him to even cheat on me.
Even though he didn't do anything wrong at all.
He's so nice to me.
Do you want me to be a bad person?
You understand me, right?
Thanks.
Thank you, really, for…
understanding.
Well…
I'm going to leave now.
Wait, hold on.
Since it's our last day,
have a beer with me.
One pitcher and I'll go.
Don't laugh.
This is all your fault, Guy.
When I broke up with Phing,
I was totally flirting with you.
Nope. Not at all.
That's not flirting.
I remember.
When you were with others,
you were so polite.
But look.
When you're with me…
you're so cheeky.
See, it's so clear.
I'm never cheeky with others.
So…
why do you like me?
Why do women like to ask this question?
And you want me to answer right now?
It's like romanticizing stealing someone's girl.
Hey, you're so annoying.
Just answer.
Fine, I have nothing else to lose.
When…
I'm with you, I'm so happy.
I've never been with anyone and felt so naked.
With you, I feel the world is easy.
WANT TO GO TO THE AQUARIUM?
You said you understood.
I do.
You said today was our last day.
But 24 hours isn't up yet.
Let's go. As friends.
WHAT A SLOW POKE, JUNE.
YOU'RE THE SLOW ONE, GUY.
Ugh.
It's been flooding every day.
I guess the government is being romantic.
Like Venice. Get it?
The water's really high.
I can't go any further.
Get off here, okay?
Oh, sure. We'll get off here.
Guy, you don't have to come.
June.
June.
June!
Don't make it any worse.
Choose me.
What's wrong with being with me?
I'm sorry. Calm down.
Why did you do it?
-She's the same age as Kie. -I broke up with her.
I didn't mean to. I don't have any feelings for her anymore.
-It's done with. -Rie caught Nhoom having an affair.
I already told you everything, Rie!
I admitted I made a mistake.
We have kids together!
I don't have any feelings for her anymore.
I'm sorry.
-Get out of here! Get out! -What about our kids?
No, Rie.
Keep your chump change and get out.
-What do you want me to do? -Go!
Get out! What about our kids?
-I already broke up with her. -Like I said, I can raise them myself.
Can you give me a chance?
Think of our kids!
-Get out. -Feel sorry for our kids.
They're mine as well!
I'M BLOCKING YOU, OKAY?
He's been having the affair for a long time.
She posted a picture of them together,
and someone sent it to Rie.
Maybe she was trying her luck.
Nhoom wouldn't make up his mind.
So, she set off the bomb.
I feel like…
I can't continue on.
I just can't anymore.
I understand everything.
I just don't understand.
What did I do wrong?
You didn't do anything wrong. It's all on me.
Pete, you're a nice and good person.
Is it because I proposed?
Right?
It's me who's not ready for a lot of things.
I might be too young.
I…
I don't have a future.
I haven't achieved anything.
I might be a bit selfish, but…
if I'm still with you, then all I'll ever be is
"June, Pete's girlfriend."
"June, Pete's housewife."
I don't like the person I am right now.
I'm sorry.
These are all the reasons, right?
Right?
Well?
Yeah.
It's okay.
I understand everything. I do.
Don't cry anymore.
Want some water?
I'll get you some.
CAN WE TALK?
Don't get up.
Sit.
Look at this.
What's this?
Well?
Say something!
Explain!
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Hello?
Damn it, I'll go. Sorry, bro.
Damn it, I'll go. Sorry, bro. What the hell?
Damn you.
Where's June?
She's gone!
What the hell did you do, idiot?
She left it for you.
Hey.
Sorry for leaving you this letter.
I still don't want to see you for a while.
I hope you understand.
To tell you the truth,
I don't know how I'm supposed to feel.
But I can't stay here any longer.
By the time you read this letter,
I'll probably be gone.
And…
we might not meet again.
What we did,
which should have been between two people,
has now hurt others.
It's bad that it turned out this way.
It's not my place to say anything.
It's now…
time to really move on, huh?
I LOVE YOU, RIE. CAN I GET A HUG?
I want you to be happy with your life.
Good luck.
PATED TALK
PETE SHADING HIS EX WITH TEN MILLION VIEWS
JUNE WITHOUT JUNE
So, for the most awaited question, which is inevitable.
FIRST COMMENT
When you put your ex's name in the song,
at the time, what were you thinking?
THEY'RE BOTH TRASH SINCE UNIVERSITY
Well…
BINGBING SUSU: YOU'RE HANDSOME
…actually, it's not hard at all.
I just hate her.
That's all.
Okay, sure.
PETE'S COOL STYLE FASHION IMPORTED FROM KOREA
You're such a prick.
Thanks so much.
Really, thank you.
Thanks for coming today.
Hope to see you again.
Excuse me.
Was it noisy inside?
What are you doing out here alone?
Farting.
Did you get this from an Internet meme?
I've seen it.
Hey, you might be the first person to know of this.
If you don't mind,
can I have your number?
Sure. But just so you know, I have a boyfriend.
LEX AND TAH
THEME: WEAR ANYTHING YOU WANT BUT DON'T FORGET A MONEY ENVELOPE
Ah-ha. You thought I was going to propose, huh?
Lex, I'm joking.
Surprise!
That's it.
Yeah, I know.
I already told you I can't go.
But this is my wedding.
Do I have to beg you?
Bro, I already went to your engagement party.
Hey, I'm busy at the moment. I'm having dinner with my family.
You're afraid of running into June, right?
No.
I'm fine now.
What about June? Is she okay seeing me?
She's not coming back from London anymore.
So, now can you come?
Sure, I'll go.
See? That wasn't so hard.
Hold up.
You're tricking me, right?
Damn!
You've gotten smarter.
Yeah. Sure.
-I'm not going. -Guy--
If there're no feelings, then go.
That means there're feelings.
Not feeling is feeling.
-Feelings. -Feelings.
I said I don't have feelings.
I just don't wanna feel awkward when we meet.
Great, huh?
Guy's finally moved on.
Right?
One, two, three.
A round of applause, please.
Let's go for it.
Kiss on the cheek.
Can you feel a little shy?
There's a small request
from one of our guests.
They'd like
Tah to carry Lex like a princess.
Can you?
Easy.
-Really? -Yup.
-Are you confident? -I can carry her for three hours.
Three hours?
CAN WE TALK?
INCOMING CALL
Hello?
Hello.
It's okay. Are you ready?
So…
what is it?
Well, Tah told me
you're not going to his wedding because of me.
Hey. That's not true.
Let's try.
And turn around too. Be careful not to trip on the carpet.
Really?
Then,
can you go?
I don't want to cause any trouble between you and Tah.
Did Tah ask you to call me?
Well, yeah.
It's one reason.
Okay, let's now watch Lex and Tah's presentation,
right now.
And the other reason?
I just wanted to let you know first
in case we run into each other.
It'd be awkward, for sure.
Isn't this weird,
you telling me it'll be awkward if we met?
Well, it is.
I just want you to prepare yourself, that's all.
I think
my feelings towards you still aren't normal.
June…
I'm sorry about what happened with Pete and for getting you into trouble.
All of it.
Hey.
You don't have to apologize.
I'm also in the wrong about this
because I was also playing along.
No matter what, I still want to say sorry.
I'm the cause of it, right?
Why are we fighting over who's wrong?
Actually, there are good things about it.
I've never had to rely on myself this much before,
which has made me like myself much more.
Thanks for choosing me, Lex.
One reason I didn't talk to you
is because I wanted to stop thinking about the past.
Sorry for disappearing.
Yeah. I understand.
Singles ladies, come to the front.
Come on. Don't be shy.
June.
Can I ask you something?
-Let's toss it. -Toss it now.
What?
From all the things that happened to us,
even if most of it was bad,
but there were some good things too, right?
Three, two, one!
Toss it!
If one day you feel okay with me,
can we be friends again?
Of course.
Promise?
Promise.
Thanks.
For what?
Thanks for calling.
I have no more regrets.
Good to hear.
I'll see you then.
See you.
We're married!
It's lame. Stupid.
Why is my life filled with these thoughts?
-You're so lame. -That's who you are.
That's right.
-So lame. -It's fine. Everyone understands you.
-It's fine. It's normal. -Really?
-June's old enough. She understands. -That's good.
Is that it?
-Can you go? -I think we'll be late.
We need to talk.
Why?
What?
How did you get this?
I thought I got rid of it.
Well…
It's still usable.
Why get rid of it?
Don't think it means anything.
Thank you, God.
Guy thinks to himself.
I secretly wrote a song for a friend to play on my wedding day.
He has loved the same girl for a very long time.
No matter how long it is…
Hold on. I forgot the lyrics!
I'm nervous.
No matter how long it is My heart is still with you
No matter how long it is I still miss you every time
No matter how long it is The memories still linger
No matter how long it is
No matter how long it is
I thought my love has ended
Not seeing you would make it fade away
But it never ends
It feels like my long journey
Is erased after seeing you…
Again
No matter how long it is My heart is still with you
No matter how long it is I still miss you every time
No matter how long it is The memories still linger
Here's how it happened.
I went to school at Florida State. I was not a very good student.
This is how bad I was.
I signed up for a Russian class one time, thinking it was Spanish.
And it took me three classes before I realized,
-"I don't think this is Spanish." -[audience laughs]
So I took Russian 1, 2, 3, and 4, never learned a fucking word.
The end of Russian 4, same teacher pulls me aside.
She's like, "Yo, we're taking a trip to Russia.
If you go, you'll get a minor."
I was like, "Strasvutsia, bitches, I'm back!"
We went to Russia. The Russian mob ran everything.
And they told us that our first night.
I'm in the back of the class like, "This trip just got fucking awesome."
Then, like, in exchange for our money, they gave us two young gangsters.
The word for that in Russian is "banditti."
[continues on TV] So I ended up befriending the banditti.
Then, one night, the whole class is taking an overnight train trip to Moscow.
We roll to the bar car like a big dick in a locker room.
Just, not that I've ever been that guy, but I've seen it.
So the banditti says to me,
"Don't worry. When it gets dark, we have good time."
I'm like, "What are we doing when it gets dark?"
Reaches into his pocket, pulls a ring of keys out.
He goes, "We're robbing the whole fucking train."
Now...
I'm a good per-- I'm an okay person.
My point is, we fucking robbed them.
We robbed the whole train, and then we drank hard as shit.
Pull in to Moscow at 6 a.m., hammered, piss drunk. Train stops.
My whole class, they're in their pajamas.
They're upset. They've been robbed. I get it.
-[gunshots] -I'm the Machine!
They look at me and look at each other and they're like, "Fuck it! He's the Machine!"

[man] Okay.
So, Bert, how we doing today?
I feel fantastic.
I'm eating clean. I'm working out.
Blood pressure's down.
No more partying. [chuckles]
I haven't called anyone in this room the C-word in almost three months, huh?
He's never called Tat a C-word.
-Oh, she's never acted like a C-word. -Thanks, Dad.
-So Mom and I act like C-words? -[Bert laughs]
You'd be shocked.
-Wait. Just leave it there. -Mom! Mom?
-Okay. -[Sasha] Mom.
-Mom. -I'm still waiting.
-All right! -That's not fair.
Bert, why are we here?
Well, I wanted you guys to see the progress that I've made.
To see how far I've come.
Personal growth isn't something that you need to point out.
Progress is something that your family should be noticing on their own.
Bro, that's why they're here, to notice it.
Hey, if you're not on my team, shut the fuck up, okay?
Okay, no. Has Bert ever talked about his father?
-No. -[Bert] This has absolutely
-nothing to do with my father. -Huh.
I had an incident with my daughter.
An incident.
That was caused by my lifestyle and my behavior.
And I am taking actions to course-correct.
[LeeAnn] And you should know
that he sounds just like his father when he talks like that.
-[Bert] Hold on. -Yes.
-My father doesn't understand me. -Same.
Not same. Not same.
My father's always correcting me.
-Same, same. -Not same, same!
Your relationship with me is totally different
than my relationship with Papa.
Okay, girls, please, can you wait outside?
Perfect. Come on, Tat.
Deuces.
-So you can see what's going on? -[Bert] Yeah.
-You just saw that, right? -Yes.
Wait. You're talking about me?
Oh, yes.
Oh, fuck off.
Fuck off? Fuck you! Fuck off!
Oh, I didn't say it like, "Fuck off!"
-I said, "Fuck off." -You do not tell me "fuck off."
It's my therapy. I can say what I want.
-Actually, you can't. -No, like, you signed an oath!
Hey! I am going to allow the two of you to talk about his issues with his father.
Deuces, Bert.
You know the C-word's "cunt," right?
[Bert] Okay. Here we go.
Okay. One last push.
-You can get it all in. Get it all in. -[LeeAnn groans]
-You can get it all in. Get it all in. -[LeeAnn groans] We got it. It's gonna-- Getting it in!
We got it. It's gonna-- Getting it in!
Fifteen minutes! Fifteen...
Hey, babe! Look who's up!
Babe, 96 workouts in a row,
and I still feel like I'm sweating out toxins.
-Still smells like your skin is pissing. -Two more.
One more. Nice. Ho, ho!
-Hey. -[clatters]
Do you think people are gonna think I'm on HGH? Feel that.
-Uh... -Feel my tit.
No, like full-handed. Full-handed. Grab it.
There you go. Nice.
[laughs] I'm making smoothies.
[yells] Who wants smoothies?
[Sasha] Mom, can you please tell him
not to do anything embarrassing at my party today?
Whoa! So that's how we're gonna start our morning?
I haven't done anything publicly embarrassing
in almost three months.
Okay.
But don't go overboard this time.
I just want it to be with my friends.
What friends?
-So not cool. -Don't.
Are those nut sacks?
No.
It's a pimple for Dr. Pimple Popper.
Oh, you don't think that's a little gross?
Uh, it's totally gross.
That's why Sasha and I love it.
If you think about it,
it's kind of like a metaphor for her exploding into womanhood.
What is wrong with this shirt?
Supposed to be like this?
Hey, babe.
If I stand like this, does it look tucked in?
Don't wear that shirt.
All right.
What are these, my dad's shirts?
Can you please help me pick out a shirt?
Okay.
I think that this therapy is making everything worse.
I think you need to get back on-stage.
[laughs] That's definitely not happening.
-Why? -Sit down.
Have you ever seen The Nutty Professor?
-Uh, no, I have not. -Okay.
Eddie Murphy turns into this one guy,
which is great at first.
But then his family starts hating him and he starts hating himself.
Look.
I'm the Machine on-stage.
I'm also the Machine off-stage.
I got high and I got drunk,
and I almost got our daughter arrested.
I saw the look in her face.
I was helpless and I couldn't do anything,
and I wanted to kill myself.
I will never let that happen to our family again.
Well, fuck, now I wanna watch The Nutty Professor.
It's a pretty good movie. I wish you had watched it.
It's exactly what I'm going through right now.
Maybe for now, for today, we keep it simple.
-I can do simple. -Yeah?
[Bert] There she is.
There's my birthday girl.
Hey, Sash, what do you think of the party?
It's kind of big.
Kind of big and awesome, right?
Hey, Bert, does the DJ have any glitchcore?
Hey, Madison...
I'll go check.
-Hey. Hey. -What's up?
I thought you said you invited like ten people.
-Oh, no. I invited a ton. -Ugh.
Well, you can't risk no-shows, babe.
And partying with six people is fucking depressing.
I even invited parents that hate me.
-What's up, Madison's mom? -Oh. Hm.
That guy's a bitch. He is such a...
She's going through a divorce. Be nice. -Seriously? -Mm-hm.
Hey, hey. This is a sweet 16.
-It's a big deal. -Yeah, for Sash.
I think Skeletor over there must be the DJ.
Can you tell him where to set up?
[Bert] Yeah. Hey, Trainspotting.
You have any glitchcore? Wait, is that my boom box?
Yeah.
-Is that my auxiliary cord? -Yeah.
Oh, do you want my phone?
Nah.
Fucking disgusting.
Hey, don't do that around the kids.
Actually, you know what? Stay away from the kids. We got music! I think.
What are you doing up here? Girls are in the pool.
They're talking about you. Jump in.
Take your shirts off. Don't piss in my pool.
-Yo, Machine. -Not today, brother. Not today.
Ladies. Steer clear of the DJ. Food's to the right, all right?
Hey, Kreischer, no booze?
Hey, Madison's mom, no husband?
[laughs] Fucking bitch.
Killing it, B-Man. Killing it.
[man] Hey there.
Dad?
In the flesh.
I see you haven't given up trying to learn how to barbecue.
Good for you, son.
Wait, what are you doing here?
Well, I'm not gonna miss my grandkid's sweet 16.
It's a big day.
Right. Right.
Well...
Not gonna flip them yet, huh?
Might be... Eh, it's okay, it's okay.
Really?
Well, I just don't want you to mess them up.
You know, then people will be disappointed.
You'll feel bad.
It'll be all that, "Huh, remember Bert's barbecue?
-Those burgers, yikes." -[Bert] Goddamn it.
Oh, see?
Did you add egg to the mix?
-Okay, Dad. -It binds. It moisturizes.
Makes a much better burger.
-Oh. -My dad showed up.
-From Florida? -Yeah.
And it took about two seconds before he started making me mental with the:
-Look at him! -Hey, Boo Bear! Hi!
He's a monster.
Okay, yeah. Breathe it out there, champ.
-[Tatiana] Hey, hey, Dad? -Yes!
Yeah, no. The dog's pooping in the pool.
-What? -[girl] Gross!
Wait, how?
You paid money to see my son take off his shirt
and tell his made-up story about robbing a train in Russia?
Dad, for the millionth time, it's a true story.
It's my job, okay?
[man] And you should get back on-stage.
'Cause I've seen you only like five times.
You paid to see him five times?
I'm just shocked that people would actually do that.
[Bert] Dad.
[Albert] You don't buy carpet five times.
-Bye, Papa. -[Albert chuckles] Oh, sweetheart.
[Sasha] I'm sorry, I'm gonna go.
[Albert] Oh, don't worry about that.
And you remember, you can call me anytime whenever you want to talk about...
Well, you know.
-All right. Bye. -[Bert] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, where are you going? Hold on.
-Bye, Bert. -[Bert] Mr. Kreischer. Hey, stop!
-What? -[Bert] Where are you going?
Mads asked me to go to Big Bear for like three days.
You are not going anywhere. Hey, you're 16 years old.
You're not going to Big Bear, 'cause you're gonna drink beer and smoke pot.
I'll be fine because I'm not you. Okay?
Okay, stop. That's fair. That's fair.
I deserve that. I deserve that. Okay?
Hey. Look at me. Look at me. Don't go.
We wrap up this party, me and you,
hang out tonight, we'll watch Dr. Pimple Popper.
I don't even watch that show anymore, Dad.
And I don't even know half of these people here.
What, are you kidding me?
You know-- What about this guy? You know this guy.
-Ray Ray. -You know Ray Ray.
Dad, I said I wanted a small party,
and you promised that you wouldn't embarrass me.
I'm just trying to be a good dad.
See?
It's about you.
-It's always about you! -[Bert] What are you talking about?
How did I make it about...? How did you flip that?
Don't do that! Don't leave!
Don't you flip me off!
Don't you get in that car!
Don't get-- See?
This is the C-word behavior I was talking about in therapy!
I'm not saying it! I'm just pointing it out!
It's your fat fucking fault! Asshole!
Goddamn it.
Son?
Not now, Dad.
We should...
You know...
if you're searching for a new path,
there's always room for you at Kreischer Karpets.
I'm good, Dad, okay? I'm good. I promise.
Just give me a minute.
Well...
I just wasn't sure, you know, how you're making money
if you're not doing the whole comedy thing anymore.
Hey, I'm a grown man.
I'll figure it out, okay?
Yeah, all right, all right, you know.
Just trying to help.
Hold on right there.
No, you're not. You're never trying to help, Dad.
That's the point.
When I got in trouble, what did you say to me? "Oh, don't be an idiot."
My advice to you was don't do stupid things in public,
-especially with the children. -Oh, same thing!
Which is good advice.
And you and Sasha wouldn't be where you were
if you'd only listened to me.
-[door opens] -Oh, my God.
Ma'am, the party's outside. Okay?
[with Russian accent] Are you the Machine?
Oh, shit.
Yeah, I am. And I can do a picture in a second.
I'm kind of having a private moment with my father, okay? Hmm.
I'm here for the pocket watch
stolen on a train in Russia 23 years ago
by you.
Okay.
I'm having a shitshow day.
So if this is some sort of TikTok prank, I'm about to lose my fucking shit.
It's definitely a prank. Clearly, that's a fake gun.
-[Bert yelps] -[whimpers] Or not!
-She's got a fucking gun! -I'm clear on that now.
-Sit down! -Yes, ma'am.
My name is Irina Ivanona Volgina.
And I suggest you start remembering.
It was 20 years ago. I barely remember that trip.
I don't have a watch, and it's definitely not here.
Then you're coming with me back to Russia to find it.
Russia? [yells]
-[grunts] -Look at your daughter.
So innocent.
So pure.
So vulnerable.
Do you see that man?
[Bert] DJ Chemo?
He will follow her on her trip.
If you do not find my watch,
he kills her.
If you try to run, he kills her.
You say a word about this to anyone...
he kills her.
Okay. Okay.
I'll do whatever you want. Just let my daughter go.
Listen, I'll do whatever you want.
Just don't hurt my daughter. And let my father go, all right?
He wasn't supposed to be here. He wasn't even invited.
-I'm going with you. -Dad, you're not going with me.
I wouldn't be able to live with myself if you failed to protect Sasha.
-Dad, stop! You're not going! -He goes!
If you need persuading in Russia,
he might be useful.
For torture.
The car is waiting.
We leave now.
Dad, put your fucking hands down.
Excuse me. Hey, Albert?
Hold, hold, hold, wait up.
Oh, my God. I haven't even seen you yet. I'm so sorry I haven't said hi.
-Hello. -Hello, dear.
-There are so many people here. -[Albert] Mm-hm.
Hi. Oh, who is this?
Uh, this is our, uh, Uber driver, uh, Sylvia.
Sylvia.
Hi.
Hi. Your Uber driver?
Where are you going? -Uh... -Um...
[LeeAnn] Oh, my God.
Yeah. I see what's going on.
You two are gonna follow Sasha to Big Bear.
-Yes, we are. -Exactly. Big Bear, yes.
Cool. Great. Well, you know what?
I'll just stay home, take care of everything,
and the two of you can just fuck off on your creepy little puritanical--
[Bert] I love you. I'm sorry. Kiss Tats for me.
Dad, let's go.
Where...?
Good work, Kreischers.
[Irina] This is my bodyguard, Sponge.
Sponge, like you absorb liquids?
Absorb bullets. [laughs]
Still think I made the story up?
Move it.
[in English] They said Machine had ice in veins.
Could walk through the walls.
Drink more than any man.
I grew up hearing this myth.
You.
You're fat.
And you have tits.
Very disturbing.
That's body-shaming. And honestly, I expect more empathy out of a woman.
Such a disappointment.
Like opening peanuts and joke snake pop out.
Enjoy your flight, Machine.
It will probably be your last.
All right. When we land, I'm gonna create a diversion.
What I want you to do is go to the embassy.
Dad.
Now, these people really know what they're doing around the grill.
How can you eat at a time like this?
Son, I'm a small-business owner from a "stand your ground" state.
This is like a Tuesday for me.
[Sponge] Machina, the myth.
Your turn, huh? [laughs]
No, no. I wish I could. I just got a crown replaced.
-Oh, Machina. -[Russians grumbling]
But I have an uneven jaw, and it took them forever to...
-[Albert] Hey, Bert. -What?
You want to know why people respect Kreischer Karpets?
It's not 'cause you spelled "carpets" with a K.
No, that's just good marketing.
It's because we install anywhere.
-We never show fear. -[stirring music playing]
We face it.
So, Bert, don't show fear.
You really shoehorned that message in.
All right, Sponge, I guess I got next.
Machina,
all I have heard about you, and you have titty, huh?
You're such a large man.
[Bert laughs] You're so fucking big.
Let's hope this works.
I'm gonna show you what we in the States call "dad strength."
[Sponge] Funny!
Now...
my turn, huh?
[Albert in distorted voice] Well, you showed fear.
[Albert in normal voice] Son, I think this trip to Russia could give you some... direction.
Look, I had this with me in Rome.
Saved me more than a few times.
You take care of it...
it will take care of you.
-Your pocketknife? -Mm-hm.
Ah, thanks, Dad.
We hope our sons grow up to be the men we wish we could be, Bert.
Maybe this trip can start you on that path.
And also...
if you lose that knife in Russia,
I will disown you.
Ah, funny story.
I did lose your knife in Russia.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I knew you'd let me down.
You did?
Got your manhood!
Oh, you took my testicles!
-Hey there. -[Irina] While you were out,
-your father and I got to know each other. -Wait.
Also, we watched Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid.
The ending? Wow.
Dad, that's our movie.
Bert, we have to find this watch.
You stole it. What'd you do with it?
Jesus Christ. It's the top five drunkest I've ever been in my life.
I'm usually drunk when I tell the story.
-[dramatic music playing] -Okay. Okay. Hold on, hold on.
Give me a sec. Let me think. Let me think. God. I'm not good with guns at my head.
Fedor. What about Fedor?
He was the gangster on the train. Everything we stole, we gave to him.
Yeah, I talked to Fedor.
He doesn't remember the watch.
So I killed him.
Jesus Christ.
Igor.
Which Igor?
I know like 50 Igors.
Uh, Igor was the mobster that took care of our class.
He lived with us in the dorms.
Maybe he still lives in the dorms.
Fuck school. Let's party.
Then this is where we go.
Can't believe you watched Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Fuck.
Follow my lead. If we get a chance, we run.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad.
Oh, my God. Oh! Oh, oh!
He's going down. He's going down.
[Bert] Jeez Louise!
[Bert] Wait.
That's me. I'm the Machine.
Why am I on a billboard?
[Sponge] Da. You famous.
[chuckles] I'm hot folklore in the Soviet Union.
[in English] The Soviet Union is dead, you ignorant fuck!
We're Russia. We're strong.
[Sponge] We're here.
They turned it into condos.
Oh, hello there.
[Bert] Hey, Dad, this isn't Orlando. Quit trying to work a threesome.
Put it back in your pants.
Well, that was rude.
Move.
Hey, here's where we took classes.
This is where I met Igor.
Wow. Twenty-three years ago.
I should've taken more pictures of my dick. ♪ I don't practice Santeria I ain't got no crystal ball ♪
♪ Well, I'd pop a cap in Sancho And I'd slap her down... ♪
[woman] Okay, class, listen up.
Do not expect an easy course load.
It isn't a vacation.
Your goal is to culturally bond with the indigenous citizens.
This is Igor. He is a banditti. You will be taking courses...
I actually don't speak much Russian. What is "banditti"?
Oh, um, "banditti" is the Russian word for mobster.
This is a class trip. How come we've never met?
Oh, I don't go to class much. I'm Bert.
[Ashley] Oh, Ashley.
[woman] But Russia is a dangerous place.
Igor is our fixer.
He is only here for your protection.
He is very dangerous.
[woman] You are not to talk to or hang out with him.
All I want to do is hang out with him.
[Albert] I never know what to believe about what you say happened back then.
You do have a very active imagination.
[chuckles] I imagine.
-That's my issue. -[Albert] Well, one of them.
[Irina] My father and I have a similar relationship.
[Bert] What the fuck is this thing? Is it an iPad?
I got this, son.
I am an Eagle Scout.
[Irina] What is an Eagle Scout?
It's like if James Bond was a Mormon.
An Eagle Scout can get in anywhere.
You'd know that if you'd become an Eagle Scout.
But no... [yells]
My fist is Eagle Scout.
I'll wait in the car.
[Irina] He has impulse-control issue.
Very sad.
[Bert] Steroids will do that to you.
They really dressed this place up.
Still have the world's smallest elevator.
Holy shit.
There was a woman that sat right there.
She absolutely loved me.
Igor's room was all the way down to the right.
I took a shit on a pizza box right there.
Jesus, son.
Eh, it got mixed reviews.
Honestly, if I hadn't sprained that finger,
probably would've made it to the league.
But, you know, I wasn't about to lose a thumb war
to a 12-year-old, you know?
Here you go, dabushka.
Gifts from your American friend.
Gifts are a very important aspect of Russian life, Ash.
-Bet you didn't know that. -[Ashley] Mm.
Bet you didn't know your fly was down.
[Irina] Why are you telling us this?
[Bert] Sorry. Lot of memories being back here.
Whoa, you live right across from Igor and the banditti?
Do you ever hear, like, screams coming from their room?
No, not really.
[Bert] Look at them.
They're magnificent.
How do I talk to them? How do I say my name?
[Bert] I planned the perfect sentence.
But the second I was face-to-face with a real Russian gangster,
I panicked.
Ya machina.
Ya machina.
[Bert] "Muchina" means badass.
"Machina" means machine.
I said I was the Machine.
[Irina] You're an idiot.
Ya machina?
-[Bert] Luckily... -[laughing]
...they thought it was hilarious.
On machina!
[Bert] They introduced me to their world, and I introduced them to mine.
Vodka, lemon, two teaspoons of sugar.
-These are called lemon drops. -They're called lemon drops.
Okay, they're from Florida, and they're fucking delicious!
The Machine is powered by lemons!
[Bert] And the legend of the Machine was born.
All right, all right, all right.
This next one's a little thing I like to call Beavis and Butt-Head.
His head is a butt!
[Bert] They had no frame of reference for American culture.
[in British accent] Do I make you horny?
[Albert] Austin Powers? Really?
[Bert] Shut up, Dad.
So I stole from the best, and they thought it was me.
To them, I was just some crazy genius who could out-drink them all.
-I'm the Machine! -[cheering]
I call this the "Macarena."
[Bert] Word spread fast.
And the legend of the Machine just kept growing.
[Irina] Everyone in Russia heard the stories.
You were folklore. [Bert laughs] I was good for Igor's business.
[Bert laughs] I was good for Igor's business.
People paid him to party with me.
Wait! The stash hole!
Igor's room has a stash hole in it, in the wall.
And what does he keep in this hole?
Beanie Babies.
Come on. Drugs, money and porn. You're in the mob.
But maybe there's something in there that can tell us how to find him.
It's this one right here.
I hope so, for your daughter's sake.
Oi!
-That's feminism. You asked for it. -Fuck you! Pussy woman-boy!
Well, I see wokeness hasn't made its way to Russia.
-The hole? -Yeah, right.
All right.
That wall used to go all the way down.
[in muffled voice] If I'm not mistaken...
Bingo.
[Irina] No watch.
[Bert] This is something way better.
One of Ash's pot brownies, Dad.
These things were gold back in the day.
Why would anyone keep 20-year-old marijuana brownies?
Ashley's pot brownies are the best thing I've ever tasted.
They're mad strong, though, so only eat a little.
-Don't fuck. -[laughing]
You're fucking with me, man.
Go fuck yourself.
Hey, how'd you become a banditti?
One day,
man told me,
"Igor, help me with this thing."
Thing was mafia.
'Cause if I get hungry, I get hangry, and everybody knows
marijuana goes bad after time. It's like the reverse of pickles.
[Irina] So no Igor, no watch.
Just old money and pickle weed.
This is not good for you, Bert.
-[woman] Fuck you. -[tense music playing]
[Irina] Vanya.
It's not good for you either.
[Vanya] He is Machina?
The man's man?
Nah.
He has, uh... breasts.
Your friend, Igor,
he took over the trains to Moscow.
And now I know where to find the watch.
[in English] How do you know Igor runs trains?
Because...
I am respected.
I make it my job to know these things.
You?
You are foolish woman.
Playing pretend.
I do not play.
Holy cow!
You're an insolent child, Vanya.
Now you come with me on train or you go out window.
-All right, let's go, Dad. Come on. -Yeah, let's go. Let's go.
See you around.
Put your hands down.
Well, this is wonderful.
We're about to be killed by gangsters.
And you're pocketing ancient pot brownies.
You say shit like that and you wonder why we haven't visited in three years.
-So now it's my fault? -Yeah.
I don't want to be around that. Neither do my kids.
Your kids are great. Don't bring them into this.
[Bert] Oh, I know they're great, Dad. They're my kids.
[Albert] You know, your problem is you live this life where you get rewarded
for indulging in your worst tendencies.
Let's hope that was an adjustment.
Meet you downstairs.
Well, we should be safe in here.
I got you, son!
No, I got you! I'm covering you!
-Everything's under control! -No!
[Bert] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Lift! -No! No, no! Close, close!
-Lift! -No! No, no! Close, close! -[Albert] Close the door! -Shoot back, idiots!
-[Albert] Close the door! -Shoot back, idiots!
[Vanya] I will present the boss with your head, Machina!
Dad.
I can't use that.
After I read Mandela's biography,
I made a vow of nonviolence.
[Vanya] You are dead!
Dead!
Fine. I'm just gonna shoot him in the leg.
Let's go, dickheads!
Goddamn it. Let go.
No! I'm glad you're alive! Let go of me!
-[Albert] Get in the car, son. -I'm trying, Dad!
Sponge!
[Bert] So bad. This is not going away.
I'm gonna meet the devil.
I'm going to fucking hell.
-Oh, shit. -[Albert] I'm at my lake house.
-Goddamn it. -[Albert] The fish are jumping.
-I'm having mac and cheese for dinner. -Are you doing breathing exercises?
You can't do breathing exercises for murder, Dad.
I killed a man.
Well, technically, you killed several men.
Oh, God! You're not helping!
-[Irina in English] Hey. -[Bert] What?
It happens.
I'm not gonna start smoking cigarettes. No, it doesn't happen.
I'm not gonna start smoking cigarettes. No, it doesn't happen. A speeding ticket, that happens.
Shitting your pants at Best Buy, that happens.
My brother Vanya was an asshole. Oh!
Brother? Like your real brother?
Like your mom and dad are the same mom and dad?
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
-I didn't know he was your brother. -Don't be.
There is a power struggle in the mob.
As oldest, I will inherit my father's empire,
but Vanya wants control.
Wanted control.
-He's dead. -[Bert gasps] Oh, my God.
I'm still getting used to it.
[Bert] What the fuck is happening? Get me the fuck out of here.
Many others also want control.
They say I cannot run mob because I'm woman.
This isn't happening.
[Sponge] Boss.
[Bert] Dad.
Give me some life advice, some words of wisdom.
Everybody's gotta die sometime.
That's it?
That's your advice?
Well, what do you want me to say?
That vulnerability is scary and it's hard to open up?
Yeah, Dad. That would've been great.
[Albert laughs] Son.
It was your mother that was the coddler, not me.
[Bert] Jesus. We got it, Sasquatch.
Igor. Igor.
I'm coming. I'm coming.
Hey.
My brother would have shot me if he had a chance.
Thank you for making his death very fast.
Well, then, can I real quick call my daughter,
just to make sure she's okay?
Don't push it.
Now, this is the kind of Russian architecture I wanted to see.
We're not on a sightseeing tour, Dad.
Hey, Irina, I think this is gonna be great.
We'll find Igor, we'll get your watch, and then you can let us go, right?
Holy cow.
This place hasn't changed a bit.
Oh. Right there.
That's where Igor introduced me to the train banditti.
I cannot go on your student trip to Moscow.
-What? -Yeah.
Different mafia runs train.
Igor, what am I supposed to do here?
What you always do.
[in English] Come on, show them your character.
British horny man. Come on.
[in British accent] Do I make you horny, baby?
-Do I make you randy? Yeah. -Eh? It's classic.
[Irina] You really like Austin Powers.
Yeah. It was really big in the late '90s. Give me a break, okay?
I get it.
I get why they liked you.
Wow, thanks, Dad.
Your toxic masculinity was lighthearted and progressive to them.
Yeah, well, your compliment sounds a little bit like a slam.
-Quiet, fucked-up father-son. -[Sponge] Boss.
This is the Moscow line.
If Igor runs trains, this is where he will be.
Be careful.
Train mob is very dangerous.
Don't worry. Igor's my boy.
If he's here, we're all set.
Yes, but he knows you.
They don't.
[Bert] They look like they're cosplaying American History X.
Let's go down further.
Less eyes.
Hello.
[Bert] Doesn't that sound mean the train's departing?
-[Irina] Get on! -Wait, what's the plan? What are we doing?
[Irina] We stay on train till we find Igor.
Get the plane, meet me in Moscow with the rest of the men.
I cannot believe I'm doing this Moscow trip over again.
-[Irina] Move. -[Bert] Wow.
This train smells exactly like it did in '98.
[Young Bert groans] It smells like cabbage and grandmas.
So long, Saint Petersburg! Hello, Moscow!
Oh, sorry.
Why does everyone here look like they want to punch me in the face?
It's improper to smile in Russia, Bert.
You save it for the people you love.
Do you?
-Really? -What even is that?
So you want to stay up all night in the bar car or...?
I don't know how you can drink so much and never gain any weight.
I just have really great genes.
Do you maybe want to hang in my cabin instead?
[Bert] I did.
I definitely did.
Ow. Fucking idiot. Fuck.
Thanks, Dad, for the dull fucking knife.
Ash. Hey.
Yeah.
Fucking ow.
Way too much.
Yeah.
-Hey. -Hey, what are you doing?
Uh, not much.
I don't know. It's pretty crazy in there.
So you still want to hang out? It's cool if not.
You know, I'm a big fan of romantic buildup.
[Ashley] Oh, yeah?
[Bert] Yeah. I don't even think Ross and Rachel should be together yet.
[Ashley] Me neither.
-[Bert] Save that for the millennium. -[Ashley] Yeah.
-I kind of think we should... -[Fedor] You.
Hey.
You are one they call Machine?
Yeah, uh, that's me.
[Bert] Fedor was the boss of the train banditti.
He smelled like nicotine patches
and looked at me the way Ted Bundy looked at coeds.
It was horrible.
Machine does not ride with the peasants. Come, come.
Uh, Ashley, I'm gonna go hang out with these scary dudes for a little bit,
and then I'll be right back, okay? I'll check back in.
FYI, I'm a good bed sharer.
Okay? Fun to cuddle with, no night farts...
[Albert scoffs] You left that girl so you could hang out with a criminal?
[Irina] He's right. She was a sure thing.
[Bert] Yeah, well, I've never been good with sure things.
But Fedor took me to the bar car.
This place had booze, drugs, and here's the real gangster part.
[Bert] They knew who I was.
[in English] They like you, huh?
[Bert] I guarantee this is where we'll find Igor.
I guess nobody parties in the bar car anymore. [Irina] Hmm. Especially Igor.
[Irina] Hmm. Especially Igor.
You know, 23-year-old me loved this place.
Now it looks like a truck-stop bathroom.
I think your therapist would call that "growth people notice."
[Bert] Wait.
Did LeeAnn tell you I was in therapy?
Well...
when she called to invite me to the party,
she opened up about what you're going through.
After Sasha's arrest, we were both worried you'd...
well, you know, mess up again.
Motherfucker!
Does no one trust me?
Or am I the guy that's only gonna mess up again?
-You're making a scene. -[Bert] A scene?
I pay my bills by making a scene!
I rip my shirt off and yell, "I'm the Machine!"
[man] Hey!
Who says, "I am Machine"?
You?
They say Machine can walk through walls. Only a ghost can do that.
You...
you are not Machine.
You want to see the fucking Machine? They want to see the Machine.
You want to see the fucking Machine? They want to see the Machine. -You're getting the fucking Machine. -Hey, where you going?
-You're getting the fucking Machine. -Hey, where you going?
First up, I don't normally do this for free.
Secondly, you're dressed like dickheads.
Matching Nazi dickheads.
And third, you say it three times and he shows up.
It's a lot like Candyman.
You've already said it twice.
That's me.
That's me on this bottle of vodka that says "The Machine."
[Albert] What are you doing? -Dad, sit down! -[Albert] Ah!
-Igor. -Igor?
Igor, it's your boy Bert.
You better have my watch, bitch. Finish it up.
[in English] Igor want to see you. He will come to the bar car soon.
But before that, it would be an honor to party with you...
Machine.
[Bert] Strasvutsia, bitches.
Let's do it.
[Fedor] You do drink like Russian.
-Alcohol is the universal language. -[Fedor] Yes.
We're all drunk on the inside.
So when do we meet the real Machine, huh?
All right, listen up.
♪ I did it all for the nookie ♪
♪ Come on ♪
-♪ The nookie ♪ -♪ Come on ♪
♪ So you can take that cookie ♪

Yo, teach. Hey, check it out.
I'm culturally bonding with the indigenous citizens.

♪ I did it all for the nookie ♪
-♪ Come on ♪ -♪ The nookie ♪
-♪ Come on ♪ -♪ So you can take that cookie... ♪
Fuck that bitch!
This is...
[all] Russia!
[Bert] Dad, you said I had to go to Russia to find myself.
Well, I did.
-I'm king of the world! -[Russians cheering]
[Bert] That's how I felt.
I was king of the world.
[Irina] Blech. Titanic?
[Bert] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I was stealing wholesale from A-list movies,
but it worked.
Let me tell you something.
Entertaining criminals and sex workers was amazing.
Maybe that's why I do so well in Florida, huh?
They don't even get it.
Tell us more stories, Machine.
The bar car was a blast.
But it's also where shit got real.
Uh, what do you want, Fedor?
Bread. Okay, cool. Wait.
-I knew you said "bread." -Yes.
I'm picking up the language. Give me another one.
Cheese.
I'm basically fluent.
Uh... money. Got it.
Cool. Um...
Oh, no, are we robbing this guy?
Yeah, I don't...
I don't really want to rob anyone.
[Fedor in English] Yes, you do.
Do it. Pussy.
First him, then train.
So that's what we did.
-We robbed the train. -[man] Yeah.
[Bert] I was terrified.
They were practically giddy.
[Fedor] Let's go.
[Bert] Fedor kept feeding me booze.
Now you drink vodka.
Let's go. Drink.
That's it.
[Bert] I was completely out of control.
I mean, the rush of it. Turned into a thrill.
This is my room.
I was robbing the train with the Russian mafia.
And I wasn't dying.
[Young Bert] That's all my-- That's all my stuff.
Wait, wait, wait. You're actually taking my stuff?
Oh, no, no, no, no. That's my dad's, uh, knife.
You can't take that.
No, no, no.
You can take the other stuff. But the knife?
-That's my dad's. -[Fedor] Really?
No go.
I can't take, huh?
I'm sorry, Dad.
I let him steal it.
[Young Bert] It's all yours.
Machine.
I would've cut out his heart
and make him watch it stop beating with his last breath.
I guess we're just built different.
The watch.
[Bert] Once I got really drunk...
I robbed my class.
I robbed my whole class.
[Ashley] What the hell? Get out.
-[Fedor laughs] -Fuck that bitch. This is Russia.
Ash.
I'm...
Whoa! Woman hit man?
That is new. [laughs]
I felt like a complete and total piece of shit.
[Fedor] Give it. Fast, fast. Give me ring.
Let's go. [speaks in Russian]
-Okay? -That's it.
-Good boy. -Okay.
I'll get it back.
I promise.
I'm sorry, Ash.
Yeah, fuck you.
[man] Machine is the man.
Hey. Machine. Igor need us in front of train.
You wait here. We come back with him.
Machine!
Do you talk about that part with...?
With Ashley when you do your show?
Obviously not, Dad.
But I think about it sometimes.
I think I liked that story better when I thought it was a lie.
And then what? Story of you being stupid idiot asshole is sad,
but you need to remember my watch.
I remember.
There was one last private cabin.
[in English] Do it.
Sorry.
That was the watch.
My father was no criminal.
He was a salesman.
And then you stole the only thing he ever cared about.
He called police, but no one would help him.
It made him say, "Fuck honest living!
If you want respect, you have to take it."
And from there, he built our family.
Oh, my God.
I'm your origin story.
Most people see themselves as Batman...
not the guy who killed Batman's parents.
What did you do with the watch after that?
We went back to the bar car.
Fedor went through all the stuff that we stole.
-Ugh. -[watch playing delicate classical music] I hate this song.
Listen, in Russia,
we always give gifts to a new friend.
Take, Machine.
He gave you the watch?
-Where is it, Bert? I need to know. -[Bert] I don't know.
[man] Machine.
Igor is here.
Igor, I present to you the Machine.
Your friend has aged even worse than you.
My men say:
"Come to meet famous Machine from a vodka bottle."
I say, "Why not?
You can take selfie."
But you're not famous.
You have tits.
Yeah, we've established that.
I don't know this guy. This isn't Igor.
Who are you?
I knew old Igor. My name is also Igor.
I took train from him, make him disappear.
My train now.
Wait, Igor's dead?
Yeah.
-And you're gonna die also. -[Irina] Enough.
I'm Irina Ivanona Volgina.
You know who my father is.
These two dipshits belong to me.
Now go, if you want to live to see your children again.
Stupid bitch.
You think I didn't ask for permission?
Permission?
All right!
Listen up.
-Never show fear, right? -Yeah.
Now, look.
[Bert] Wait, that's the knife you gave me.
No. I gave you one just like it.
I knew you couldn't be trusted with the original.
-I'm not an idiot. -Oh, my God.
You heard me pining about that knife.
You knew I felt guilty for losing it for like 25 years!
That's enough.
[Bert] Dad, stab this bald fucker.
I'm sorry, son.
-But... -[Bert] I can't breathe.
...I swore I would never use a weapon for violence.
Oh, my God.
She cut his throat, Dad.
Oh, no, don't touch it. It's bad.
Oh, why is he touching it?
Oh, no. Why are you smiling?
Stop. Stop right there. Stop.
What am I supposed to do, Dad? What am I supposed to do?
Hit him, son.
Oh, my God, Dad, I'm inside him!
-Oh, my God! [screaming] -[Igor grunting]
[Bert] Let go of my arm! I'll try to get it out!
He's so warm!
No, no, no! God!
God! Help me let go!
God! You're, like, fisting his neck.
Help me!
Son of a bitch! God!
It's like a pickle jar. Just let go of the pickle.
Damn it, Dad. It's nothing like a pickle jar!
Oh, shit!
-Incoming! -[crossing alarm ringing]
Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull!
Oh, my God!
Get it off! Get it off me!
Get it off me!
No, not that way! The other way!
Hey, were you saying "pull" or "pole"?
Does it really fucking matter, Dad?!
Why did he say he had permission to kill us?
I know where we can find out.
Uh, hello. Can I have your attention, please?
We're here looking for whoever sent that large, bald man
to kill me and my son.
[Bert] Dad. Hey, Dad.
Dad.
Maybe ease up on the Russian mafia, okay?
-[Irina] Alexei. -Hmm. It is so nice to see you, sister.
-You have another brother? -[Irina] Mm.
[Alexei] Da. Three of us. Now two.
But thank you for killing him.
He was pain in ass.
And very stupid.
You have the meanest family of all time.
Kind of you to say, Machine.
I can't agree with your methods or your business model,
but it warms my heart to see a son
willing to take on his father's legacy.
Albert, Machine's father.
Oh, sister.
I intend to bring our father the watch Machine stole.
It is over.
Give me Machine.
Machine leads me to watch.
I win.
All right. You win.
You get the watch.
It is here?
[Bert] Oh, yeah. It is here.
In this room.
We don't have it. We came to collect it.
From him.
Keyser Söze.
[Alexei] Keyser Söze?
Yeah, he has it. Go ahead, give it to him.
-[speaks in Russian] -[Bert] Yep, it's his now.
I'm out of the equation.
Where are we going?
You're gonna get us all killed!
Shut up and run.
There we go.
[Irina] Fuck!
Tsk, tsk, tsk. You make me chase you.
Not nice.
You think you're so cool.
Sister, do you really think you'd take over family?
Why?
I'm strong. I'm smart.
Please. You are a woman.
The world is changing.
Even for our family.
Father and I, we laugh about your delusions.
You and Father always underestimate me.
But you know what?
I deserve to be treated as an equal.
Agreed.
-[Alexei] Hey. -Jesus.
I like this feminism thing.
And if you don't want me to kill your father next,
you will take me to the watch.
[Bert] All right. Stop, stop, stop. I'm gonna do whatever you want.
Don't hurt my father, okay? Give me a second.
Dad, Dad, Dad. Listen to me. Listen to me.
We're gonna be fine. We're gonna be a team.
Dad, listen to me right now.
Butch Cassidy and Sundance. End of the movie, Dad.
-Waterfall. We're gonna waterfall. -Enough.
This is for your own good.
Dad!
[Albert] My son is a moron. You were wasting your time.
I'll help find your watch.
But only if you promise to keep my granddaughter safe.
You are a very good father.
[Sasha in distorted voice] A cop pulled us over. Dad, there's a cop.
Officer, no, I don't have a driver's license.
My dad's in the backseat.
Dad, stop. Shit, Dad.
Dad, wake up.
[groaning] Oh, God.
Oh, shit.
Son of a bitch.
Hello?!
Fucking Dad.
I'm tired.
I'm sore. I'm hungry.
I'm hungry.
Thank you, Ash.
Wait.
Hey.
Is my daughter okay?
No.
[Albert in echoey voice] My son is a moron.
[Young Bert] Hey, what's up, sleepyhead?
-What's this thing? -It's a mace.
The fuck are you doing here?
Oh, I'm not here. You're just really high.
I am really high.
God, I came to Russia to become a man.
All I became was an asshole criminal.
Yeah. You're gonna hang on to that for a while.
A lot of it, all the shit that happened on the train.
But, hey, that shirtless-idiot thing?
[chuckles] It pays off bigtime.
-Really? -Oh, yeah.
-Yeah? -Oh, dude.
This trip to Russia sets you on a path.
You, my friend, are great at making people laugh.
Thanks, man.
-I am gonna be okay. -Yeah.
And then your wife's gonna put you in therapy. Whoa.
-We're married? -Oh, yeah.
Is she hot?
-I mean, yeah. -Wait, what do you mean?
I mean, I think she's hot. I think she's hot. I mean, she's 50.
You married a 50-year-old?
Dude, what the fuck? I thought you said we were gonna be okay.
No, I forgot how dumb I am.
We married her when she was 30.
She was-- She still is a smoke show. She's hot as shit, okay?
-Okay. -Don't make me defend our wife.
She's a great mom.
We got kids?
-Yeah. -Boys?
-Mm... -Ah, I knew we'd have boys.
I always wanted to have boys.
Look at us.
Both of us just figuring ourselves out.
Well, I am.
You're still pretty lost.
I mean, you're literally lost in a forest.
High on a pot brownie.
'Cause your dad kicked you off a train.
Because he hates you.
Because you can't save your own daughter, who hates you.
Now your wife's gonna hate you. Your whole family pretty much hates you.
Stop, stop, stop.
I know this. I know this. Why are you doing this to me?
'Cause I'm trying to save you. You're about to get shot.
How so?
You're about to get shot.
Meaning what?
You're under fire.
Fuck! God!
Oh, my God!
Fuck.
Bert?
Igor?
-Bert! -Igor! Oh!
-Machina! -Igor!
You look like a big bear. I mean, what?
-God. -My friend, you are here.
I can't believe you're alive. Oh, shit. It's good to see you.
Do you have any snacks?
[Igor] This is my home.
For years now.
[Bert] Nice. It's kind of like West Virginia. [Igor] Yeah. West Vagina.
[man] Igor! Deuces.
[Bert] That's uncircumcised.
-[Bert] Ho! You almost hit that guy, Igor. -Yeah.
It's a tradition here.
Ah, look at this.
This is it.
-[Bert] This is your house? -[Igor] Yeah.
Holy shit.
Oh! Wait, are these all your kids?
Yeah, this is most of my kids.
-Oh, my God. -[speaking in Russian]
Jesus, you know you can pull out, right?
Yes, but my dick is little bit longer, so I'm like:
-Oh, like a magician. -Magician!
-With the scarves! -Yeah.
-Hey. -I missed you.
...Machina!
[Bert] Hey! Yeah!
-Oh, Machina! -Yeah!
[yelps] Igor.
Igor, Igor.
My wife, she's a big fan of you, Machine.
-Oh! -Many in village are.
They listen to your podcast.
Why no new episodes?
-[in English] She find whore. -What?
-Holy shit! Irina! You're alive! -[groans]
How the fuck are you still alive?
Goddamn it. Oh, my God!
[in English] Would you like to buy her for the fucking?
I don't know.
What do you think? How much?
More than you have.
I don't know, maybe--
Oh, my God! What happened to your leg?
Oh, that looks bad.
Here, tell me if you feel this. -[screams] -Oh!
Igor! Help! I know this whore!
Let's get her in your house!
-Here. -Igor, do you have any hydrogen peroxide?
Uh... no, but we have many kind of animal spit.
-[Bert] Okay, well, here you go. -Fuck! [screams]
Okay, you're fine. No, no, no. We're good.
-[Irina] Fuck! -Just get me something to dress it with.
-I gotta get this boot off. -[Irina cries, then groans]
-Okay. Okay, here we go. -Okay. Wait, wait, be careful.
-[Bert] All right. -[Irina groans]
-Oh, it's pretty bad. Okay. -[groaning]
-Oh, is it bad? -It's not that bad.
-Is it that bad? Oh, fuck! -It's not that bad.
I just can't look at it. [vomits]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Fuck!
It's fine. It's fine.
Did you just put it in your pocket?
I didn't know where to put it.
Oh, I'm gonna be sick now. Oh, fuck!
Don't you throw up. If you throw up, I'm gonna throw up.
Don't throw up. Don't throw up. Please don't throw up.
-I won't throw up. You don't throw up. -I won't throw up if you don't throw up.
-I'll trust you. Okay. -Deal.
Oh, God. Okay.
-Just do something about it! -I don't think I can do this.
Give me a pep talk.
-Just pull it out. You can do it. -Okay.
-I can do it? -You can do it. Just pull it out. Okay?
-One, two... -Three, two...
No, wait. No, wait.
-Three! Two! One! -Three! Two! One!
I did it! I did it!
You're not gonna...
[Bert] So anyway, I shoot the dude,
he shoots another dude, dude shoots another dude.
Three dudes, one-- Four-- Three-- Three bullets.
It was top ten all-time kills for me. Hell, yeah!
Yeah. Oh, is this...?
-Are we high-fiving a murder? -Yeah.
Hey, where is your father now?
Who the fuck knows?
Let me tell you something. If he is alive, I'm fucking killing him.
Hey, Igor, what brought you here?
Hey, thanks to you, Bert.
-Me? -Yeah.
What?
When I saw how you find joy in every moment,
it make me think, "Mafia is dangerous."
Not easy life.
And one day, as I strangle man for not paying me for...
ah, whatever,
-I remembered something you say. -What?
You told me most important thing in life,
it is to find your smile.
-Ho, ho. Igor. -Huh?
I stole that from City Slickers.
Billy Crystal? 1980s? Cowboys? Nothing?
His whole deal is stealing shit.
[Bert] Back then, Irina. Okay?
Hey, I just left. It was my choice.
My smile.
Mafia was not my smile.
This was. Children, family, Sonia.
In mafia, I would have died.
But I have this, thanks to you, Bert.
You saved my life.
Good for you, Igor.
Hey, at least I didn't ruin his life, right?
[Irina whispering] Bert?
Bert?
Hey. Are you asleep?
Yeah.
What is this thing you did that made your daughter hate you?
All right.
So me and my big fat friend Tom, we're doing a podcast,
and we get accidentally very fucked up.
-That's not so bad. -[Bert] Wait for it.
So Sasha's 15, right? She's got her learner's permit.
I'm like, "Hey, come out to me,
get my car, drive me home." Right? Bam, bam.
You asked your teenage daughter to drive you home drunk?
[Bert] It gets worse, okay?
She rolls a stop sign.
Cop pulls her over.
Turns out having a parent in the car doesn't count if the parent's trashed.
She can't get her license for two years. I got a misdemeanor. It was awful.
Well, if that's everything, that's not so bad.
I wish that was the worst thing my father ever did to me.
It almost sounds nice.
Four minutes before I passed out, I started a livestream.
And I livestreamed the entire event.
It immediately went viral.
Next weekend was Father's Day.
She was so mad.
Oh, God, she didn't talk to me for a month.
It was a wake-up call.
I've been this party guy for so long, I don't even know who I am anymore.
Then maybe you're not supposed to be only Bert.
Huh? Look what you did for Igor.
Your stupid drunk talk, it saved his life.
I don't follow.
We do not grow by destroying part of ourselves.
We grow by finding a balance between parts.
Balance like Steve Urkel.
Did you just say "Urkel"?
It's a reference to one of my favorite American television shows.
Family Matters.
You know it?
Yeah. Wait. But wait. What the fuck's Urkel got to do with this?
In Season 5, Steve Urkel takes this potion
that transforms him into Stefan Urquelle, like, this cool version of him.
Everyone starts hating him, but what does he do?
He doesn't surrender.
He improves his formula,
and in the end, he gets best of both worlds.
You are the Machine and Bert.
You have both sides.
But now you need to balance.
Oh. I get it.
Goddamn it.
Can't believe I slept on Family Matters.
Oh, you should definitely watch it. It's very good.
"Did I do that?"
[gasps] He watched it.
When Communists came, politburo burned down the church
and build this factory.
When the Communists leave, factory closed.
When I came to the village, I helped them build this.
-[Bert] You built this? -[Igor] No, no. Inside.
I took you here because building this place,
feeling closer to God,
taught me how to forgive myself.
You know, for all the bad things that I did, murders,
all those years ago.
Why do you think I hooked you up with the train banditti?
I don't know. To show them a good time?
Da. And?
To keep your class safe.
Train banditti are very dangerous.
They do terrible things to the passengers.
I introduced them to Machine to distract them,
by doing what he always does.
Yeah. I robbed a lot of people, Igor.
So?
Was anyone hurt, killed?
You spit in a girl's face. You were an asshole.
But your class, they were safe
because you did exactly what you're supposed to do,
by showing them good time, making them laugh.
You protected those people.
That is what a man does.
Goddamn it.
[Irina] Seems you're a good man, Bert.
-[Bert] Thanks, Irina. -[watch playing delicate classical music]
[Igor] It's time to feed the kids.
Holy shit! That's the watch! Oh!
My father's watch.
How do you have that?
You gave it to me when you left Russia.
You said it was thank-you for being a true friend.
You were very, very drunk.
I was embarrassed taking it,
but the words were nice, so I just took it.
Sweet, drunk words.
God, yes.
Let's go, Bert.
I have an empire to claim.
I would pay to listen to her talk during sex.
I would pay to have sex with her.
[Bert] Sorry about your bathroom.
[in English] Thank you for taming the whore.
No, thank you.
I'll cherish these.
The fuck am I supposed to do with a chicken?
Hey, Bert. I need to come clean.
After train, I talked to Fedor, and...
he gave me what you stole from class.
Then everyone go back to U.S.A., so I kept it to remember.
-[Bert] Hold on. No way. -[Igor] Yeah.
Dude.
Hey, take it.
And go to Moscow and save your father.
If he's still alive. He may have been tortured to death.
I think she's autistic.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
Hey, man. Thank you for everything, man.
-No, no, no. -No?
You've been a good-luck charm to me.
-My life changed the day I met you. -Hey.
-Bert, thank you. -No, thank you.
-No, thank you. -No, thank you.
-God. I'll miss you, brother. -["Hey, Man, Nice Shot" by Filter playing]
[Irina] I'm gonna miss these disgusting poor people.
So you just think it and say it? You don't stop it at all, right?
Yes, basically.
-Never met someone like myself before. -Yeah.
♪ Hey, man ♪
[Albert] So I keep having this recurring dream
where Dolly Parton throws me her pick,
calls me on-stage, and wants me to jam with her.
I'm freaking shredding,
but my fingers turn into spiders and my teeth fall out.
Pretty sure it's my heart medication having a reaction with my sleeping pill.
But, hey, it's better than doing acid,
and kind of the highlight of my day at this point.
-It's sad but true. -What the fuck is going on in here?
Oh, hi, son.
[Bert] You two are buds now?
Dad, why are you talking all fast like you're on speed?
'Cause I'm on speed. And it is so, so, so great.
Oh! More drugs.
Look at me.
I'm Molly Parton!
You see what I did there?
Irina. You're alive.
-Super. -Yes, asshole, I am alive.
I brought the Machine, and I even have the watch.
So suck my dick.
-Thanks. -Fuck you, Sponge!
No, fuck you.
He pay me.
You hit me.
[Irina] I should have left you in that gulag
with those doctors poking and prodding you.
I would string you up by your balls.
Machine.
I must say,
your dad is so fun.
He is the original Machine.
[Albert] I'm the prototype.
[Alexei] He has been partying with us.
Now, your mom was more of a kind of missionary kind of gal,
but Annika... Oh, ho!
-She's got the cushion for the Pushkin. -[Russians laughing]
Oh, Dad, please stop.
See, your dad has spent so long looking after you,
he never got a chance to have fun on his own.
What a load of horseshit that is.
Those Dolly Parton tickets he was just bragging about? Front row?
Who do you think bought them for him?
And to think I thought I was finally understanding you.
I found your fucking knife. Yeah, you want this piece of shit?
When he kicked me off the train,
I thought, "Maybe he's trying to keep me safe, protect me,
I thought, "Maybe he's trying to keep me safe, protect me, or has a plan."
But no plan. No fucking plan.
You're just a big old dick!
I may have let you down in this world. You've pointed that out a lot.
But you know what, Dad? You have let me down.
Just like I let Sasha down.
I can't believe I thought you were here to take care of me.
Dad, take a fucking look around.
You let me down!
Son.
I will always take care of you.
[Alexei] What?
You people threatened my granddaughter,
you kidnapped my son,
and made me do a lot of amazing drugs.
And this is how we say thank you in Florida.
Holy shit!
Motherfucking Eagle Scout.
Oh! Oh, fuck!
You have amazing tits! -["Take Me Home Country Roads" playing]
-[gunfire] -[Bert] Oh, shit!
I got the doors!
God!
I thought you were nonviolent.
I am! But I also love my son!
I knew you'd survive falling off that train
because of your big old boobies and protective layers of fat.
Oh, my God, you're so high right now.
I am so high. I am so high!
Idiots, stop talking and run. I'll find the watch.
Come on, come on, come on.
Shit. Let's go, Keith Richards.
Dad, come on! Stop lollygagging!
God. All right. Have a great night, everybody.
Ooh, you're dropping your money.
Don't drink and drive. Grab a T-shirt on your way out.
All right, have a good one. Oh, here we go. The last ones out.
Sorry for the gunfire, everybody. Have a great night.
Take care. Thank you very much.
All right, Dad. We're good.
Now, listen, I need you to use this drug energy for good.
All right? Like Charlie Sheen did.
Oh, shit. Dad, get down.
-Bert. -Shh! -I lied. -Stop talking.
Come on, let's go.
[Albert] Look at me. I think I failed you as a dad.
-Dad, be quiet. -[Albert] I can't.
I'm feeling so many feelings, and I need to tell you about them.
Bert?
-Bert? -What?
I need to say this.
Instead of accepting you, I criticized you.
But it was only because I wanted to keep you safe.
Why have you never told me this?
I don't know. It's...
Vulnerability is scary, and opening up is hard.
-What drugs did they give you? -Well, well, it was...
Okay, come on. Let's go. Let's go.
[Albert] One was yellow, but I don't know what it was.
-Bert. -Dad, shut the fuck up.
[Albert] This is important.
All dads mess up, Bert.
But the good ones, we--
We try to do better.
I guess sometimes it just...
takes us a while.
You're my boy, Bert.
Don't ever forget that.
You'll always...
be my boy.
This is nice, Dad.
You should do drugs more often. Look at us.
We're finally working through our shit.
[Bert] Dad, let's go!
Goddamn!
I just wish it had happened before we were about to die!
No, we're not gonna die.
Here.
You have always succeeded by being exactly you.
Now, take off that shirt
and show those SOBs who you really are.
Hey!
[in English] Fuck.
Now you gotta party with me.
Who the fuck are you?
He's the motherfucking Machine!
Oh, shit. Oh.
Oh! I'm bulletproof, baby! Yeah!
Come on! Yeah!
Suck my dick, Captain America.
Machina!
[Bert] What are you gonna do with a stick? Come on.
I got your stick now.
Not too bad.
-[shouts in Russian] -Put your hands down.
Get down now! Come on!
God, I'm so strong!
Here we go. Dad, Dad. Down, down.
Help me fuck up Lenin.
-Let's do it. -Come on!
Take that, Communist!
Hey. Eagle Scout.
We have a rematch.
-Hammer, Dad. -Here.
Oh, titty boy.
[Albert] I got you, son!
Dad! Dad!
[Sponge] Sorry, old man.
Absorb that, Sponge.
Oh, shit. Dad. Get off!
Are you okay? You okay?
I-- I saved you.
Yeah, you did.
Oh, shit.
Come here! Come on, Dad, let's walk. Oh, shit. Shit. Let me see.
-[gun cocks] -You... are nothing...
...but an ignorant, fat American who has no respect.
Our father earned our respect.
Your father...
sells carpets.
I think I will make him watch you die, Machine.
My name's not Machine.
My name is Albert Charles Kreischer III,
son to Albert Charles Kreischer Jr.,
owner and operator of Kreischer Karpets,
the best goddamn carpets you can find in Southwest Florida!
Three convenient locations.
[Bert] Tell him, Dad!
And if I ever see your albino-looking ass again,
I'm gonna whip it quick as a bitch.
And last but surely not least,
I'm gonna need that knife back. That's a family heirloom.
-You want knife? -Oh, yeah.
Oh, I wouldn't-- I wouldn't do it that way, though.
I would have someone help you. Oh, God. It's--
Oh, my Jesus. That's how Steve Irwin died.
Oh, my God.
You work out every day? That's-- Looks like an everyday thing.
-Enough talk. -All right, yep.
Oh. So now's when we bang, huh?
[Bert] Okay, here we go.
So you can fight.
I went to Florida State.
All we know how to do is fight, fuck and drink.
And I can't fuck worth shit.
Oh. I just got that crown.
Would you like to know why I hate you, Machine?
Oh, I'm dying to know.
All my life, men were measured against your stupid legend.
"The best."
"The man's man."
I say, fuck that!
So I worked to make myself better than you.
Stronger than you.
Look at you now, Machine.
You are nothing.
So dramatic, Alexei.
All these fucking speeches.
Irina.
Typical macho bullshit.
-[Bert] Oh, Dad! -Whoa, whoa, my arm!
-Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. -Ow. Son...
you didn't show fear.
Your watch, Papa.
I brought it here to return it to you.
So...
it's clear that I have won.
[in English] Oh, Irina. My beautiful daughter.
You want to take over?
You cannot even kill brother.
You become friends with idiot.
I would never give this to you.
Actually, can I step in for a second?
I think you guys should talk it out. Me and my dad--
-This is Russia. -Okay, okay.
We don't do your weak, America, lovey-huggy shit.
Da. Hugs are for pussies.
Oh. Well, that explains a lot.
Alexei understands.
It is why he will run family.
You are weak.
A leader must be a wolf.
Kill or be killed.
If you do not like it,
take it up with God.
But you first.
Did I do that?
[whimpers] I am definitely watching Family Matters when we get home.
Look at that! Look at that! Look at that!
Irina, we can work together.
I am your brother.
Shut the fuck up!
Take him to our family dacha while I decide
which part of him to cut off for his insolence.
[Irina] Fuck you, bitch. This is Russia.
-[Bert laughing] -Machine, I will kill you someday!
-I don't think so. -[Alexei] I will come for you!
-I don't know about that. -Machine!
-[Bert] I can't hear you. -[Alexei] I will come for you!
Whoo! Go, me! Right?
That was awesome!
Thank you, Bert. You inspired me.
Wait, how?
When you said you're going to kill your dad at Igor's house.
-You said you were gonna kill me? -Well, yeah. You kicked me off a train.
Now go, before police shows up.
-And, Bert. -Yeah?
Your daughter is sweet.
-My DJ friend tells me she's a good girl. -Ahh.
-Some drugs. But smoke, not snort. -Okay.
-Good girl. -Yeah.
[in English] You're a good dad.
Keep it up.
Or else your daughter may kill you. [laughs]
Thanks, Irina.
See you around, pussy boy.
[Sasha] Hey, deuces. Bye.
[Madison] Bye, girl.
-Dad? -[Bert] Keep it, sir. Thank you.
-Dad, look. Mom said that... -Oh, my gosh!
-There she is! Come here! -What?
Oh, my God, I love you.
I am so sorry. You are a fantastic kid. Oh.
No, look. I'm really sorry. I was really mean at the party.
Look at us. We're apologizing.
I should be kidnapped to Russia once a year
-just to make this happen, right? -What?
[Bert] Oh, there's the smile.
You did that smile when you were a little girl.
You're still my little girl.
Oh! And there's my woman.
Oh, well, well. It's nice to see you two back.
I hope you worked out your shit finally, be--
The fuck are you wearing?
-Oh, my God, what is that smell? -Okay, these are clothes.
I do not know what that smell is.
-Did you go to Vegas? -I did not.
-Where's your dad? -Dad's in Florida.
He's got a doctor buddy he plays golf with who doesn't ask questions.
We could all use one of those, right?
-Dad! Hey! -[Bert] Oh, there she is!
From the top rope!
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, I love you! My favorite daughter!
-Just kidding. I'm not kidding. -Hey.
I can't wait till you get kidnapped.
-What? -Guys, Dad's back!
Dad's back! It's old-school Dad!
[therapist] How was your week?
Oof. Complicated.
Dear Ashley, are you still hot? I'm not.
I don't expect you to forgive me,
but I wanted to keep my promise.
Gifts are an important aspect of Russian life.
So are apologies.
This is mine.
Last week, the subject of your father came up,
and I thought we could explore that.
[Bert] Jesus Christ, Dad. That Annika girl.
-Did you wear condoms? -Oh, oh, oh. Will you stop? Stop.
-[laughs] I'm just saying. -I don't want to hear it again.
Please put that down the memory hole.
I can't, Dad.
Since when do you have such a razor-sharp memory?
What happened--
When you say things like, "Your mom is a missionary woman."
[Albert] Oh, no!
Nah, we're good.
You and your father?
Yeah. We're thick as thieves. Butch and Sundance.
-Really? -Yeah.
Well, if you don't mind, can I ask how that resolved itself?
You can ask, but I don't think you're gonna believe me.
Well, humor me.
All right.
When I was 48 years old, I got involved with the Russian mafia.
Here's how it happened.
What's up, Florida?
It's your boy, Bert Kreischer.
The Machine.
I love three things:
-Having a great time... -[man] Yeah!
...making sure other people have a great time,
and quality carpets
-delivered at a reasonable price. -[man] Oh, yeah!
That's why, if you're looking for some acrylic,
wool, plush, saxony, or level loop...
None of that nylon shit.
...you need to find your way to a Kreischer Karpets.
It's my dad's business, and he's right here.
Say hi, Dad.
Hey, son. You can't say a swear on TV.
The best goddamn carpets in Southwest Florida.
That's Kreischer Karpets, spelled weirdly with a K.
Take it off, Dad.
and I was quite surprised no one had done this yet.
This is world literature.
It's the anti-war novel par excellence that the whole world knows.
It's the most widely read German book.
MAKING ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT
Keep going!
Come on!
The big secret is simply to have a great team.
And I was lucky to have an incredible team around me.
James Friend as cinematographer,
Lisy Christl, Christian Goldbeck, Heike Merker…
I don't think you could find any better heads of department.
CINEMATOGRAPHY
How we were going to shoot the film and capture scenes technically…
Including scenes I was afraid of, because I didn’t know if we could do it.
Can you even shoot them the way we imagined?
PREPRODUCTION
When we started to think about where to set up production…
What is the right place?
…we looked at various options, of course.
In the Czech Republic, we started looking for ruined house structures and farm buildings
for ruined house structures and farm buildings
that we could alter and redesign architecturally
to create the destroyed hinterland in France.
During filming, there's a lot of driving around in minibuses
to look at motifs, which can be exhausting.
But Christian chose them so well that at the first one, you just thought,
"This is actually just perfect."
We found a military training area and an airfield,
45 minutes north of Prague,
and were able to set up our battlefield there between two runways.
It's a huge mud field, the size of ten soccer fields.
James once sank into the mud up to his waist.
He thought he was going to die because there was no one around.
He thought he was going to die because there was no one around. It was already dark. He lost his gum boots but somehow managed to get out.
It was already dark. He lost his gum boots but somehow managed to get out.
The whole process was insane.
It took a really long time before we knew, okay,
this is how we can hopefully make it work.
Then in January, because of all the action and running involved,
we started using a stopwatch to check
how many linear meters of trenches we actually needed.
What does an interlocking system of trenches look like?
It was like a jigsaw puzzle.
We spent almost two months at the drawing board,
going through scene by scene, mapping out the layout of the trenches,
and creating the right spacing on the battlefield,
so it would work for James Friend's camera.
A lot of the scenes were shot in one take.
After extensive planning, we started digging
and created 250 linear meters of trenches and three soccer fields of battlefield.
We learned everything there we didn't know.
We knew practically nothing,
at least as far as handling weapons or gas masks and so on is concerned.
And that was incredibly important.
We had to be able to use the weapons as if they were a part of our body.
STUNT COORDINATOR
It was good that we had the boot camp, just to learn how not to fall,
which, when you're knee-deep in mud, is no longer an advantage.
But just to get an idea of what to expect,
also with all the stunts, when things everywhere around you blow up.
With 40 kilos, sprinting 200 meters through the mud 20 times in a row
behind some tracking vehicle… Eventually, you can't go on.
Even if the head says, "Keep going," the muscles stop.
After that, I really needed a break.
It was interesting to see
how our relationship to these weapons suddenly changed.
how our relationship to these weapons suddenly changed. As soon as you're in costume, you don't do anything silly anymore.
When you're 15 kilos heavier,
because you're holding an eight-kilo rifle and you're wearing a heavy belt,
heavy boots that will possibly get soaked with water
or fill up from the top,
wet pants that can easily weigh four or five kilos…
You realize, I'm not even really acting anymore.
Because I'm actually walking here.
And there are actual stuntmen who fall into the mud in front of me,
and I'm actually jumping over them.
And there's an actual explosion, and I'm actually reacting to it.
For me, those were the most intense moments.
FILMING
It's complicated,
sending 200 people through the mud,
having tanks that are supposed to stop
and then drive over the trench.
And the trench has to be fortified.
Then the fog, or the snow, or the rain,
or the bullets that whistle past, or the explosions…
You have to set it all up precisely beforehand,
or it won't happen on the day you plan to do it.
It was incredibly powerful to be on such a huge set.
I've never been on a set this big.
And when, in response to an "And go," or an "Action,"
suddenly 250 people start working…
It took two days for my heart to stop missing a beat every time.
I mean, look at this.
I come from the theater, and I'm definitely not used to this.
It's a whole different world.
Also, how immersive the experience suddenly becomes.
The only thing separating us from a ceasefire is false pride.
The First World War, which was incredibly barbaric,
is negotiated in a very pure and radical and brutal manner in this story,
and this is also apparent in the movie.
When you're reading the script, you imagine what it's going to look like.
And then you get there, and your imagination is exceeded tenfold.
In between, there are moments where it just overwhelms you.
The size, the sheer number of people working on the project,
the sets, the structures, the production design.
There are often moments where you just think, "Wow."
SFX PROSTHETICS
For the production, we made all kinds of things
in terms of fake bodies, dummy construction, and also prosthetics.
You want to present horrific images because you're portraying the war.
Our products help portray the horror
and round the whole thing off.
There was a body hanging in a tree,
blasted into it at a great height.
The body is made of a polyurethane foam with a hard shell.
And the body parts that were visible,
because most of the clothing was also blown off, are made of silicone.
That is the material that allows us to achieve a high degree of realism.
First, it's dyed and then painted.
And then on the day, you're up on the cherry picker
at a height of 40 to 50 meters, dressing the dummy with fake blood.
Collaborating with the costume department, in addition to makeup, of course,
has been really great for me.
To experience such attention to detail, and then to work together
to recreate this marvel of the human body…
MAKEUP & COSTUME DESIGN
It became clear very quickly
that Edward really wanted to feel and see this misery.
We have roughly 800-900 uniforms,
plus the ones for the actors.
These were for all the extras.
And we also made the uniforms for almost all the actors.
For Paul Bäumer, we had around 20 uniforms, maybe more,
in all these different stages.
With bullet holes, without bullet holes, with stab wound, without stab wound.
With blood, more dirty, very dirty, brushed clean again.
We had two to three clothing rails of uniforms
that we prepared for this shoot.
And, of course, we kept having to re-treat them afterwards as well.
What kind of costumes are there? How are they made?
What kind of costumes are there? How are they made? How thick are they? And so on.
How thick are they? And so on.
And that's when, I have to admit, I first realized
that a lot of the body is covered.
And then I thought, how can I support each character
through their experience
by showing the fatigue, the deprivation, the drawn faces, and so on?
Of course, I got in touch with costume designer Lisy Christl,
because that's always a relatively close collaboration.
because that's always a relatively close collaboration. And I was able to gain a lot from her perspective and her ideas.
And I was able to gain a lot from her perspective and her ideas.
When I got started, I had no idea I could develop
so many different variants of mud.
What even is this clay?
This earth that they always crawl through and have fights on.
Then it rains, and it gets rinsed off again.
And then they are bombed and are under the earth.
That's a completely different patina or materiality altogether.
And this is how it all kind of came together.
I'm sorry.
All Quiet on the Western Front is my favorite movie so far
All Quiet on the Western Front is my favorite movie so far in terms of the score and the work,
because while the movie was a big challenge for me,
I also realized
that there was a lot of support and freedom.
Let's go!
The score feels very archaic,
because it has some very minimalist elements
that become memorable very quickly.
The score also has a certain beauty
and a certain thematic clarity,
which also relates to how it's placed in the movie.
It covers the whole spectrum from darkness to light.
My favorite track is called "Remains."
It's the music in the scene where the soldiers are handed their uniforms,
put them on and go off in a euphoric mood, singing while they march to the front.
Girl, I do love you…
That music represents a lot of what is in the movie.
It has the main theme,
but then it also conveys a certain sense of anticipation.
It's a very beautiful piece.
EPILOGUE
For him, it was incredibly demanding physically and emotionally.
What Felix has achieved here is truly impressive.
Where's the infirmary?
We connected straightaway.
This is his first big project, and it's absolutely remarkable
with how much curiosity and lack of fear he throws himself into everything.
Suddenly, people have so much confidence in you and your work.
And that confidence enables you to do things
And that confidence enables you to do things that you could never have dreamed of.
Then Edward says to you, "The way you're doing it is perfect."
We realized straightaway that he was an incredible talent.
The battle scenes were the most difficult task.
The fact that we managed to pull it off is amazing.
And I enjoy watching them.
And I think they're varied enough that again and again you get a shift in tone.
that again and again you get a shift in tone.
Hey! Hello!
A movie of this magnitude, with German actors
and a fantastic German director, that's just a great gift.
NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, I'LL BE TWO STEPS BEHIND.
TO MY LRT SEATMATE. YOU GOT OFF AT SANTOLAN.
YOUR ELBOW HURT ME, BUT IT'S OKAY. I HOPE YOU NUDGE ME AGAIN.
This one.
-Does it smell okay? -It's okay.
Here we go again.
I've been sending messages through your website,
but there's been no response.
Sir, the website is under renovation.
But your T-shirt orders are being processed as we speak.
Just be patient with us, sir.
I've been following up for two weeks.
Since you're responsible for this, you should be the first to adjust.
-Yes, sir. I'm terribly sorry. -Forget it.
Is this what you mean by good customer service? Answer me!
I'll figure something out, sir.
-Don't bother! Cancel my order. -Okay, fine!
Whatever. Fine, cancel it. It's your loss.
I'm one to talk. That's your only order this month, Mae.
I'm screwed.
Can you give me one?
Sardines are lucky, no?
Even if they're crammed in this can, they're fine.
At least they're not alone.
Oh, give me a new can. This is going to expire soon.
They're all the same.
Oh, my!
I mistook you for an employee.
I was just organizing these so other customers won't have a hard time.
This is not mine.
Oh, my!
That's mine.
I'm sorry, ma'am. I already scanned it.
I assumed you were a couple because of the way you looked at him.
I'll have our manager void the item.
No need. Just think of it as my treat.
Oh, my! You shouldn't have.
Here. Please check it.
-Here's your receipt. -Please let me pay you.
I don't want you to think I'm a scammer.
Or that this was intentional. It really isn't. How embarrassing…
Miss, please hurry up.
Where's Mr. Green?
LOOKING FOR MR. GREEN
MR. GREEN @SHOPMART GROCERY YOU SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED!
Thanks for the sponge cake.
LOOKING FOR MR. GREEN
MAYBE THIS TIME
Mae!
-Look! -Yes, Auntie?
-So many viewers! -I know.
You're famous now!
Obviously, because my plants are beautiful.
That's what the viewers really watch.
-They are beautiful. -Apart from my beauty, of course.
Not really.
But you're doing an amazing job.
You make me jealous, you seem to know what you want to do with your life.
You wake up each day already knowing your true purpose.
Most of the people I know already have plans for their future.
As for me, I'm clueless. I'm still unsure of what I really want to do.
-Auntie! -What?
You startled me.
Do you remember the boy I told you about?
Look, it's him!
I knew it. It wasn't just me.
Are you sure he means you? Really?
-Of course. Stop overthinking. -What?
Let's read it again.
Auntie, that's me!
What should I say? Hurry.
It's good you've gotten over Mark.
Do you still think about him?
Mark?
No, not anymore. That was when… when I was heartbroken.
Weren't you a mess too when you got your heart broken?
With Michael Angelo?
Of course I got hurt.
He was my one true love.
But you know, it wasn't going to work.
Don't you think it's more painful if we forced ourselves to make it work?
But it haunts you forever.
Even now, whenever you tell the story, I can still feel the pain.
Even if it's all in the past, it still hurts you like hell.
I still haven't unfollowed him.
Really?
He's still active.
He's good at showing off his girl.
They'll break up eventually.
Did you forget Mark's motto in life?
"Nothing lasts forever. Everything ends."
Why are you still affected?
-Me? Affected? -Don't you realize that?
But you do have a point.
It does hurt more if we force things.
If only I could've done more, maybe we might still be together.
But this is what's important now. What do I say?
Auntie, what do I say?
-What if that's not for you? -But it is!
YOU
DESTINED AND FATED
Okay.
Is it pretty? Is it? It's beautiful, right?
"Destined and fated."
PIXEL LORD HOW CAN YOU PROVE YOU'RE GROCERY GIRL?
PIXEL LORD HOW CAN YOU PROVE YOU'RE GROCERY GIRL? FACT CHECK. WHAT TIME WERE YOU AT THE GROCERY?
FACT CHECK. WHAT TIME WERE YOU AT THE GROCERY?
I was there at 10:00 a.m. earlier.
GINGERHEAD I WAS THERE AT 10:00 A.M. EARLIER
PIXEL LORD WOW! SORRY, IT'S MY FIRST TIME HERE.
THIS MISSED CONNECTIONS APP REALLY WORKS.
I'M NORMAN.
"Norman."
Norman…
Mark! What the hell!
So his name is Norman?
Looks handsome.
I bet this guy will also leave you.
Mark, please.
Why are you in a rush to find a boyfriend?
Don't you like me anymore?
We broke up a long time ago, remember?
Ouch! That hurts!
Oh, my! Jealous?
Reality check.
Will he like you back?
When you're this messy? It's so untidy here.
Your business is failing with no sales.
Your ideas suck.
-Try going to church-- -I'm not asking for your opinion, okay?
I just want to fall in love. But I can't find anyone worth loving.
GINGERHEAD I'M MAE.
ARE YOU FREE TOMORROW? CAN WE MEET?
DESTINED AND FATED
I'd like a new plate, please.
Okay, sir.
Thank you.
It's you. Hello, Mr. Green.
You're such a tease.
I posted something about you.
And little did I know, you also posted something about me.
That seat's taken. I'm just waiting for them.
Stop pretending! It's me!
Come on.
It's me.
What?
You paid for my sponge cake yesterday.
You posted, but you pretend like you don't know me.
No.
You're the girl I texted?
The one with a smiley face.
Why? What's wrong?
Is it because your post was not about me?
This is embarrassing.
But you said in your post, you were looking for Grocery Girl.
Wearing a white shirt and a grocery bag.
Oh, and a tote bag. This is the same bag I used yesterday.
And…
I'm so sorry. This is so embarrassing.
But look…
I'll just pay you back since you're already here.
I didn't want any trouble.
Here.
We're settled, okay?
Wait. Miss!
How do we leave a review for Missed Connections?
What?
It's the app's fault.
There should be a disclaimer that says, "Success not guaranteed."
But it worked for me.
You hungry?
Let's just order here.
I heard their goto is really good.
Really?
Yes, I designed those.
You don't look like you design shirts.
Whatever.
But you aren't making any sales.
Exactly.
You know, your shirt designs are good.
Even I can see myself buying this. See?
But it would really help you a lot if your site looked better.
I created that site all by myself.
I can't really afford those monthly subscription sites.
Too expensive.
But this can still be optimized. Especially since you're in retail.
You just need a gallery for your shirt collection,
FAQs, order status…
You can add testimonials too.
There.
You're so smart, cutie.
Well, that's my job.
I make sites for B2B and B2C.
I've been doing it for five years.
You know…
I've been looking for someone who can help me with my website.
This is embarrassing.
Is this a job opportunity?
How much is your budget?
Say, 2,500.
Maybe we are destined to meet because of this.
Probably.
Really? You mean it?
Oh, you!
We even said it at the same time.
Does it have to be at your place?
Yes, it's close by. A block away from here.
Why don't you just send me the details?
It's all at home. It'll be easier.
Or you can just send it through email.
Do you have sample photos?
It's better if you see the actual products.
And my Wi-Fi at home is pretty fast.
This is my first time to…
It's my first time to…
It's your first time coming over to a girl's place?
What if I'm a bad person?
With that face?
Doesn't look like it to me.
You?
Me?
Jeez.
It bears the same name and address I gave you.
And…
Consistent, right?
The name's consistent.
-Except for your face. -Hey!
Jeez. These were taken five years ago.
Here's mine.
Just in case.
You're so cute there.
In the photo.
So what now?
Are we good?
-Let's walk together. -No, it's okay. I'm okay.
We're here. Come in.
This is my house and my office is right over there.
I'm sorry, it's a bit messy in here.
-You live alone? -Yes, I live alone.
But…
I have an opening. You might want to apply?
To my one-man business.
Don't be silly.
Come, sit here.
Sorry for the mess.
Okay.
I thought I was going to go on a date, but I ended up getting a job.
You can do both.
Let me make it up to you.
I'll whip up something. Anything you want?
You.
Me?
It's up to you.
You're right.
Oh, stop it!
Wait. Isn't this salt?
Burnt eggs sure smell amazing!
I think I know how this is going to end.
You'll cry again alone.
I think you mean, I'll be happy and in love.
I don't understand why you try so hard
when we both know he's bound to leave you too.
Mark.
Mark.
You do know that
there's only one person I wish would leave me.
Who?
You. Give me that.
Hey! That's my coffee!
Snack time!
There, to keep your energy going.
Mae?
I can't work.
Why? Is there a problem?
Do you want to talk about your rate?
You don't like this? What? Tell me what you need.
What I need?
I need to…
clean up.
There's a mosquito.
Mae!
-Mae! -What?
Handsome's so determined. He's my idol now.
Mae! He's throwing away Mr. Bear-bear!
That's my birthday gift to you. Hey, you have to stop him. Stop him!
Why is your place so messy, anyway?
Okay. What's the story behind this?
That…
My father gave it to me before he…
My mom used to love flowers.
Back then, she would take home a different kind each day…
and place them there.
I don't like throwing things away.
It's like, when I need something, it's just there.
Nothing's missing.
And I just feel like…
I'm never alone.
As long as their things are still here, their scent is still here,
maybe their love is too.
So how did you end up designing shirts?
The words I'm unable to say, I express them through my shirts.
What about you? What's the story behind that?
This?
I've had this for five years.
I got this when I was 20 years old.
My father gave it to me before he left for Saudi.
It's to remind me to make time for the important things in life.
Like family.
But…
the more time I give, the less I get for myself.
We both have things we can't let go of.
I guess you're right.
You're really good at cleaning.
Thank you.
I'm also good at cooking and doing the laundry.
I don't believe you.
Mae.
I think I'll work on your website tomorrow.
-It's getting late. -Sure, that's okay.
You'll come back tomorrow?
I'll be back tomorrow.
What if you can't finish it by tomorrow?
Then I'll finish it the next day.
What if you can't finish it the next day?
We have plenty of time.
Okay.
Take care.
AWESOME
Don't move too much.
-Sorry. -Stay still.
Move it a little here.
-Here? -Move a bit more.
Nice, perfect!
Okay. Look here. Here.
-Why am I in it? -No way. Don't assume things.
Next shirt, please.
-"A match". -"A match".
Okay.
Ready?
I was referring to the shirt.
You can join in. I'll take your photo.
But why?
-Come on, don't be shy. -Why me?
You're selling the shirt.
I meant the T-shirt.
Next shirt, please.
You really do have a lot of one-word designs, huh?
I believe that the fewer words you use, the more sincere you are.
No matter how much someone says, it only means one thing, right?
"Hopefully."
"You."
"Tomorrow."
"Tomorrow."
"You."
"Hopefully."
I hope it's you tomorrow.
Mae, do you know what can make your designs stand out?
Amazing.
You are.
Thanks.
Exactly.
Butterflies.
That's one word.
Fe! Sorry, it's just my cat.
You're hopeless.
You smell like baby powder.
Hey, pervert!
Send him home. You're taking advantage of him.
Be quiet. You'll wake up the love of my life.
You really are shameless, aren't you?
Are you certain he's going to like you back?
If I tell him how I really feel, he'll do the same.
And once we already know how much we like each other…
that's it for us.
He's here.
Why would I let him go?
You told me that before. But look at us now.
Hey!
Okay! Fine!
I'll help you with Norman.
Norman!
Mae's going to confess to you about--
Be quiet.
Did I tell you to say it now? Not yet.
Just wait. I'm not ready.
When will you be? When he's gone?
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
It's all about timing.
It will all fall into place.
Quit that or else you'll get sued.
Fine! Okay.
TEASE
It's done.
Look.
I know.
You made that?
I love it!
Great job, Norman. I love it.
This will surely increase your sales.
The truth is…
I almost gave up pursuing this business.
It came to a point where I didn't know what to do.
Jeez. You'll make it.
Just keep at it.
No.
Because I really enjoyed working on this opportunity.
Truly.
Mae!
So what now? The website's done.
This is your chance to finally tell him how you feel.
Just tell him, "Norman, I love you. Let's be together."
The end. Listen to me.
Norman.
So…
what's next for us?
I know we still don't know each other that much.
But I just…
want to know where this is going.
And I want to…
tell you how I really feel about you.
Mae.
I told you…
I'd help you start fresh.
Yes.
But…
you must carry on by yourself.
I think your next step is to look for…
a marketing lead or…
Well…
The truth is,
I'm still not ready for those kinds of things.
I just started doing things for myself at the moment.
And one more thing.
My missed connection…
-I still want to explore it. -Who's your missed connection?
Grocery Girl.
She replied to my post.
Can you believe it?
She still saw it after all this time.
The real Grocery Girl?
Isn't it amazing?
But I swear, Mae,
I really enjoyed working with you.
Think about it, Auntie.
He said he enjoyed working with me, but as friends?
Then he still wants to find out more about his missed connection.
I don't get it, Auntie. He confuses me.
Listen, Mae. If you're not his choice, you can't force him.
Good riddance. Next. That's it.
As long as he doesn't say goodbye, there won't be a next.
What Norman and I have is something special…
but it's yet to come.
Or it's special, but really not meant to be.
That's possible too.
Auntie!
-You're not helping. -Okay. Think about it.
No matter how hard you tried, he still found his Grocery Girl.
Isn't that amazing?
But what if that's all there is?
That's possible too.
He meets her, but there's no connection.
Possibly. Maybe.
-Yes. -Right?
Yes.
I truly believe that what Norman and I have is different.
Even though we just met, it felt like we'd known each other for so long.
And even if we spend the whole day together,
it doesn't seem enough.
Surely he's not that dense, right?
I can't be the only one feeling this.
Oh, Mae.
ONE WORD SHIRTS IS A SUCCESS! A LOT OF ORDERS CAME IN FROM THE WEBSITE.
ALL THANKS TO YOU, NORMAN!
HOPEFUL
Hey!
Hey, take it…
Don't take it out on the shirts. It's not their fault.
I'm not mad at anyone.
It's very clear!
It's very clear that…
he's in the shower, that's why he hasn't responded.
Or maybe he's with someone else.
I couldn't reply right away.
I was busy doing preparations.
My youngest sister is getting married.
And I saw the photo you sent me.
We should celebrate.
Everything's clear.
Where do you want to celebrate? We can do it at my house.
I'll cook you dinner. What do you want to eat?
You don't know how to cook.
Thanks, Mae. But I can't make it tonight.
I'm meeting with Grocery Girl tonight.
I'm actually on my way to her.
That could be a scam, Norman. You know, there's a lot of them nowadays.
It might be best if you don't go.
Don't worry. I'm sure she's the one.
Where are you going to meet?
At this local bar.
Mae, are you still there?
Mae.
The line's a little choppy.
What did you say again?
"Clear!"
Hey!
Julia.
Norman.
Norman.
Norman!
Where are you?
"JGirl."
"Julia Diaz."
You think you're pretty?
Everything was okay.
We were already in love.
Wow. You're so hurt.
Are you that attractive?
Are you pretty? A priority? Are you the leading lady in a movie?
Give me a ticket so I can watch it for free.
I met him first!
We were okay. We were in love. Then she popped out of nowhere.
Hold up. Isn't she the one and you're the one in line?
Plus, you're overreacting.
Why, has Norman posted anything about you?
Mark, what does she have that I don't?
You have a point.
Actually, your question should be, "What do you have that she doesn't?"
You have a cat, right.
Influence? Definitely on yourself.
You have a business that's sort of going steady.
I know what you have that she doesn't.
How dare you!
You're such a jerk. Are you that handsome?
You're judging this face? When you fell in love with it?
Besides, do you even look at yourself in the mirror?
Your hair is as brittle as a broom.
CAN YOU DO IT, GIRL?
So expensive.
I want your senior stylist.
You mean Ms. Julia?
Actually, the salon's fully booked.
Appointments should be booked five days ahead.
And she's not available for walk-ins.
I got it.
My next appointment's at 3:00 p.m. So I think I can squeeze her in.
-Are you sure? -Yes, of course.
Mae.
Hi, I am Julia.
All right, let's go?
-Girl? Let's go? -What?
-Let's go. -Sure.
It's okay.
Hey, girl. Are you okay?
I follow you on social media.
You follow me?
I bet it feels good to be an influencer.
You have so many followers.
How does it feel like? Are guys lining up for you?
I wish. That's what everyone assumes.
I don't believe it.
With your looks?
That's exactly the problem! They say I'm too much to handle!
Just kidding.
She's so full of herself.
-Come again? -What?
I said, if I were as beautiful as you and had a body like that…
I'd flaunt it.
That's true.
But the thing is, there are women who guys take seriously.
Then there are those they just want for fun.
In my case, I'm the latter.
But you know, I met someone recently.
I just wanted to share.
How long?
Just a few weeks.
You've been dating for a while now?
What about you? Is there anyone you're interested in?
Me?
Actually, they're intimidated by me.
I can't really help it, you know?
I'm just so pretty and successful.
Just kidding.
There is someone though.
But he likes someone else.
Oh, girl.
You should fight for him. Don't ever give up.
As long as there's no ring, there's no harm in trying.
-You have a point. -Right?
I'm going to make you so pretty
so you can win his heart and get rid of that other girl.
Once I become prettier,
that girl better be ready.
True! Make your move. Okay, raise your eyebrows.
Come on. Like really high.
Too much. Lower it a bit.
There you go. Yes, that's it.
Use your eyes.
Your hands need to be light, okay?
So we can achieve our desired eye shape.
Actually, you just need to adjust based on your eyes.
I look like I have a black eye.
Just keep blending, girl.
Don't give up. We're fierce.
-Girls… -Don't you give up on me.
HI, NORMAN! YOU FREE LATER?
1 HOPEFULLY, XL 2 YOU, M
Not you. Wrong timing.
HOW ABOUT NOW? ARE YOU FREE?
"Sure. Where will we meet?"
Can you counter that?
What is he putting down?
GODDESS
Why so dressed up?
-No, this is what I normally wear. -Julia?
Sorry. I thought you were Julia.
Okay, let's sit.
This is Jeric, Jamie, and Toni.
-This is my friend, Mae. -Mae.
Now, it's my turn to summon.
-No escape now, bro. -Norman, it's your turn.
How to play? Can you teach me?
-Wait, I'm still thinking. -Screw that, bro.
Well?
Great!
That's "The Spark of Romance" card. That's ten damage points…
-You got me. -Jamie.
So how about it? Spark wins over Friendship.
Excuse me.
I think friendship would win over spark.
Because sparks usually die after a while.
Unless you keep on fanning it so the flame doesn't die, right?
-Fist bump. -Right on, bro.
-Cool. -I wasn't talking to you.
No. That's what I thought.
Well, Spark has ten damage points.
While Friendship has five damage points.
But friendship is more important than a relationship.
Because when you're friends, your compatibility
with your hobbies and your interests are more connected.
The connection is stronger.
Hold on, what are we talking about?
Wait, isn't instant attraction much better?
Right? The kind that goes boom!
-You felt that? -Intense.
Goosebumps, right? Like fireworks.
It's like it has its own push and pull.
There's tension. That's why it's exhilarating.
-That's why it's exciting. -What a jerk. He keeps butting in.
Who invented that spark anyway?
It's like New Year's Eve.
There's fireworks.
Yes, they disappear, but you know they'll light up again.
-A new chapter. -Oh, my.
-A new beginning. -Don't start with me, Norman.
That smile on your face. You can't even hide it from us.
How can I hide it?
Is there a spark anywhere here?
Are they being sold here? I'll buy them all.
Come on.
Ten minutes.
I'm really sorry, Mae.
If only I had a car, I would've driven you home.
It's okay.
Besides, I'm not your girlfriend.
That's nonsense. You're still my friend.
It's important to me you get home safe.
Where's Julia?
And why didn't you bring her here?
She is preparing for an event.
-How are you guys? -You know what…
I can't believe it.
Everything is effortless when I am with her.
We're just happy.
Like we're unstoppable.
It's like you're saying it's a struggle being with me.
Of course, it's different when I'm with you.
I feel comfortable.
You're like family to me.
I really thought we'd be awkward after--
Hey!
It's not that big of a deal.
It's already slipped my mind.
Is that so? Oh, you.
When are you going to introduce Julia to me?
Can I meet her in person?
This weekend, she has an event.
Do you want to come?
This weekend already?
Yes, of course.
You'll meet Jeric too.
He's been trying to catch your attention.
Me?
I didn't notice.
It's fine.
As soon as we get to the event, I'm sure you'll notice Jeric.
FIGHT
HOPEFUL
What the…
This can't be.
This can't be.
Norman!
Norman, hi!
You're one of my clients, right?
You know each other?
No wonder.
She's the "Mae" you've been talking about.
Oh, my. You told her about me?
Of course. You and Jeric are perfect.
Right?
Hi, Mae!
Wow, love your hat.
-You look like a painter. -I am not talking to you.
Julia, what's this event about?
It's the official launch of Ventíse Hair Treatment…
They also hired me as their brand influencer.
I wonder why. Just kidding.
Kidding.
Julia, time to take your photo.
Go ahead! Go!
Norman, you're coming too.
So Mae, have you eaten already?
-You hungry? -Shut up.
-Okay. What? -Get me some water.
-Hurry, I'm getting pissed. -Water? Cold?
Just hurry.
FIGHT
That's my favorite product in this range.
Let's try it.
Isn't he the guy you talked to me about?
What? Who?
Jeric, right?
You remembered?
Good memory. I actually forgot about it.
Julia.
Not to brag.
But when Norman is with me,
he's much happier.
He's calm.
He's not like this, so out of place.
Ever since he started dating you,
he changed.
I don't even know him anymore.
Really?
It's not good if you just play it safe.
Right, girl?
Norman is more energetic with me.
If you keep pushing him, you'll see he's capable of so many things.
He just needs a partner who keeps challenging him.
Ouch.
-Sorry. -But…
if you really love someone, you should accept him for who he is.
You shouldn't force him into your world, Julia.
With the way you look, you can be with anyone.
Why are you settling for Norman?
I have thought about that, but…
Mae, he's the one for me.
No one can even compare.
Norman is a good man.
He'll support you unconditionally.
He's awkward, but he just doesn't want attention.
He is a very honest person.
You know he'll never cheat on you.
I want to be a better person because of him.
He doesn't care about whatever hell I went through before.
What's important to him is who I am now.
Why makes you say that?
What were you before?
We have all done something we regret, haven't we?
Okay.
-Just getting some air. -Just getting some air.
-It's too crowded inside. -It's too crowded inside.
I can't in there.
I can't compete with their energy.
It's on a different level.
I get you.
-It's hard to keep up. -It's hard to keep up.
You don't have to pretend. You blend in flawlessly.
Not really.
I feel like there's something missing.
I'm glad you're here.
I can catch my breath.
Come on. Let's go back inside.
Julia's looking for me.
I'll go ahead.
-Let's go. -I'll follow.
Just look at her.
She really did change for the better.
She finally got someone to love her.
If you went through the same thing, wouldn't you wish for a change?
-It was so embarrassing. -Well, at least now she's better.
They're so sweet. They're perfect for each other.
Fuck this.
PERFECT!
"With my love."
That you stole.
Those lips.
Yes, like hers.
Those are fake.
Fake face.
So shameless.
Keep the heartbreak going.
Keep the loveteam going.
And keep the drinks pouring.
You're having extreme deja vu, right?
Just go away.
You're a liar, anyway.
I never lied to you.
I just didn't tell you the truth.
What, should I thank you?
Did I deserve that, Mark? Not knowing the truth?
My God, Mark.
You should've told me if you weren't happy anymore.
I did, Mae.
But you didn't hear me because you only listen to yourself.
If I wasn't able to hear you then, you should have screamed.
Mae.
Do you know why I resigned?
I don't know, did you?
Where did I get this scar?
Where did that come from?
You keep wanting to be understood when you can't even understand.
Wow, Mark.
I just wanted to love you…
and for you to love me back.
But you didn't love me the way I needed to, Mae.
You loved me in a way I can never escape from you.
Didn't you leave?
You left me.
Mark, I didn't do anything to you.
Exactly!
You never did anything.
You really want me to ruin you? Fine. What are you hiding?
INFLUENCER JULIA DIAZ CHEATED ON HER EX!
Julia Diaz is trending on social media for being involved in a cheating scandal.
Girl, so this is who you are.
THE NEVER-ENDING CHEATING ISSUE
DRUNK? JULIA DIAZ PARTIED AGAIN
I got you, girl.
You shouldn't have done that.
Who are these dudes?
Girl…
Norman needs to know about this.
You think you're so perfect.
NEVER SATISFIED! SO WRONG! "You're terrible, girl."
"You're terrible, girl."
Norman, she doesn't deserve you.
Besides, we met first.
A WHOLE NEW LEVEL!
Norman…
We're meant for each other.
I'm the one you deserve.
-Let's celebrate! Celebration it is! -Pipe down!
Hey!
Ouch! Success! Don't you feel victorious? Aren't you happy?
What's wrong with you?
May it be failure or success, I'll be right here with you.
It's too early to be noisy!
What's the matter? I'm just celebrating.
You are so great! You are the greatest!
You can be a tabloid writer.
Everyone is celebrating over gossip online!
Haven't you heard? Check your Facebook.
It's been getting notifications non-stop. How are you still not awake?
YUCK, SHE'S CHEATING ON HER BOYFRIEND
SHOCKING! SUCH CHEAP TASTE IN GUYS.
WHO'S THIS? WHAT A FAMEWHORE
SO MANY CHEATERS, BOYS AND GIRLS
STARLETS ARE TROUBLE
WHAT A SLUT!
WHAT?
NASTY! SUCH A FLIRT!
The judgments are circulating!
The choice of words is brilliant!
Next-level flirt!
YOU'RE THE WORST, GIRL!
Yes! Julia is canceled! High-five!
High-five. Come on, we're celeb--
It's true.
All the videos and photos you saw online are real.
YOUR MAKEUP'S GONE! KEEP CRYING!
DM ME, I'LL MAKE YOU HAPPY
BRO, STOP THE DRAMA
But it's not what you think.
I was attending a friend's birthday.
Nothing more.
I hope you don't judge me.
To everyone I've hurt, I'm sorry.
She deactivated all of her accounts.
She even deleted her YouTube videos.
Don't make it too obvious that you're affected. You can't hide it.
No, Auntie.
I'm just doing this for Norman.
I mean…
I'm just saving him from the kind of person he's in love with.
Do you remember the pain you felt with Jenny?
When she messed with you and Mark?
What does that have to do with this?
You're acting like Jenny now.
That's exactly what you're doing to Julia and Norman.
See?
That's what you've been doing. You are Jenny!
No, Auntie!
How am I like Jenny?
I am just simply fighting for the best thing that's happened to me!
That's another problem.
Why is that always dependent on the men you date?
Before it was Mark. Now, it's Norman.
Why can't you be the best thing that ever happened to you?
Then what, Auntie? I'll be an old maid like you.
No way!
Your words cut like a knife.
This is my choice.
If you love me, you should be on my side.
And now you're doubting my love for you?
I have seen you at your worst. Did I ever leave your side?
Ever since your parents passed away,
-I have always been here for you. -It's not enough, Auntie!
And if I can't even give that to myself, how can you?
Norman.
POWER
I just had to finish some orders.
Why didn't I notice it from the start?
Why? What happened?
Julia and I broke up.
She was not the woman I expected.
And I was the last one to know about it.
She said…
the guys in the photos are only her friends.
But no.
I was just an orbiter.
I'm just one of the men around her.
Was I wrong?
Maybe I didn't trust her enough.
-Maybe I should listen to her. -No.
You made the right decision.
I don't know, I think the world is messing with me.
I rarely trust anyone.
I rarely take risks in life.
And this is what I get.
I guess it's true.
She's too beautiful to be in love with someone like me.
Like…
you think you know someone and then…
they disappoint you, right?
Honest people don't exist anymore.
Don't say that.
Just let her go.
I'm here for you.
You know what?
She was supposed to be my guest
at my sister's rehearsal dinner.
Let's stop for a minute.
You're too heavy.
I can hear my mom saying,
"Do you want to grow old alone? Do you…"
Hey!
They don't even know
how difficult it is to find a girlfriend nowadays.
Okay, I'm good now.
I feel like I always fail them.
But why?
I can be your plus-one.
You're okay with that?
You know, I'm a very busy person, but…
Fine, I can't bear seeing you sad. So I'll go with you.
I really appreciate it.
You're so kind to me.
Good thing you're cute.
-I heard that. -You're just drunk.
I heard what you said. What's that?
I heard what you said. Come on, tell me.
Are you going to a Christmas party?
Are you going as a candy cane?
I know a mascot from a fast-food chain who dresses up like that.
So how's your business doing? You put it on hold?
You decided to start a business, but you can't stand by it.
That's not important right now
because I need to make the right impression.
Norman will introduce me to his family because…
we're in love.
Sorry, what? What? I didn't hear you. You're in what?
We're in love.
Wow. Don't you think that's a little too soon?
Yes. Why not?
I love him.
He made you his plus-one and you've fallen for him.
That was fast.
Give me good reasons why you fell in love with him.
Could be his eyes.
-He has beautiful eyes. -Beautiful, indeed.
Could be his nose.
-His nose has a nice shape. -It has a nice shape.
I understand.
Could also be the hair. I recognize that haircut.
-His haircut looks nice. -It looks familiar.
It's very trendy. He invited you to introduce you to his family.
Yes. Then he'll kneel and bring out a ring.
Then he'll wait for you at the altar.
You truly are hopeless!
Hey. Why do you have to ruin everything? You won't ruin my night.
-Get inside. -Wait, I'm coming with you.
-No, you won't! -Ouch!
Mae!
-Mae, you need me there! -I don't need you.
-No one will bring you to reality! -I don't care. You're useless to me.
No, you can't do it without me--
Hello, Auntie.
It's nice to meet you.
Okay, Mom.
-Okay. -Mom.
-Here you go. -Thank you, son.
-Norman! -Mae!
Hello! Am I too early?
No, you're just in time. These are all the guests.
Badge just wanted an intimate celebration.
Are you Norman's girlfriend? Oh, my!
Are you my big brother's girlfriend?
Badge, this is Mae. A friend.
What?
Nice to meet you all.
Did they catch you off guard?
It's okay.
Congratulations to your sister.
They rarely see me with a girl.
This is actually the first time.
I'm the first girl you brought here?
How did I do? Do you think they like me?
Mae.
You don't have to prove anything because we're not together.
I'm just really happy to have a friend like you here.
I see. A friend.
-Is there a problem? -Nothing.
No problem at all.
We're good.
We're really super-duper okay.
Aren't we from the very beginning?
We're friends.
Don't you like being…
friends with me?
Can I be honest with you?
What if…
what if I can't just be your friend?
Who's she?
Julia?
What are you doing here?
Bitch.
Julia, wait!
Norman!
Julia, wait!
Let's eat. Don't mind them.
Julia, wait a minute, please.
Let's talk about this. I just asked her to accompany me.
Norman.
-Is everything okay? -I knew it.
I always knew she had a thing for you!
I thought you were at the salon.
I saw the--
Saw what?
You saw those rumors about me?
Yes, I saw it.
Someone wants to ruin my reputation.
I wonder why, Mae?
Bashers won't stop harassing me.
I can't even leave my own house.
But I thought you'd be alone. I thought you'd feel lonely.
So I swallowed my pride even if your family would question me.
Because I love you.
But what do I get? Who do I find here with you?
The only person who has the strongest motive to ruin me!
If you think about it, how will she get you if I'm still around?
I think she's drunk. She's not herself.
That's enough, Julia.
You're not being sensible right now. It's embarrassing.
Is she the reason you broke up with me?
Mae has nothing to do with us.
This is all about us!
You managed to steal him away and you had him believe you too!
Enough, please.
That's not true.
I know you created The Real Julia online page!
Before I met you, my life was at peace.
You act so tough online, but where's all that strength now?
I really have no idea what you're talking about.
You envious bitch.
Why can't you just admit that you're in love with him
and you're jealous because I'm the one he loves?
That's not true.
Why do you keep lying to yourself?
He didn't choose you! He chose me!
That's not true!
No! That's not true!
It's me. Me.
What do you mean?
I want you to like me.
I just wanted you to see the kind of woman she is.
A woman's intuition is never wrong.
Fine!
Between the two of us, you're the pretty one.
You're sexier.
But what's the use of all that
if you can't accept the fact that you're just a girl who sleeps around?
You have no right to judge me like that!
Did you just come here to make a scene?
Norman, send her home.
Norman, it's her that needs to go. She's the one making a scene.
That's enough, please.
Julia, go home.
I'll take you home, please.
What did I ever do for you to do this to me, Mae?
It's not my fault if the person you love is in love with me.
And you!
Is this the kind of love you want?
A love that's willing to ruin someone else just to prove they're the one for you?
Julia.
Julia.
Norman.
Norman, are you all right?
What was it you told me?
Honest people really don't exist anymore.
But she doesn't deserve you, Norman.
Then who do I deserve?
You?
Can't you see how compatible we are?
We enjoy each other's company.
We share the same feelings.
Can't you see how much we love each other?
I don't love you.
Wasn't I ever clear with you, Mae?
If I could just say to you outright that you and I are just friends,
I would have.
But I didn't.
Because I thought I made myself clear from the start.
You are not the missed connection I'm looking for.
Norman.
Let me be the one, please.
I'll do everything.
I can put up a salon.
I can be an influencer.
Norman, I'll do whatever it takes for you to love me, please.
You are the worst thing that has ever happened to me, Mae.
If this is how you love,
it's horrible.
I thought I knew you.
But I was wrong.
So please,
delete all the things you posted.
I don't ever want to see you again.
Sorry, Norman.
Fe?
Fe?
Fe, come to Mommy.
Come on, Fe.
Fe.
One.
Two.
Three.
Fe!
All of you, just everyone…
Every one of you…
I give up.
I'm so tired.
What happened to you?
MESSY
I DELETED THE PAGE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY BUT… I'M SORRY.
HEAD OVER HEELS
Why is it that…
no matter what I do, I'm still not enough?
I totally get you, Mae.
Sometimes, it's really difficult to face the truth.
That too much love…
can be suffocating.
It's not a crime to love so much.
No, it's not a crime.
But…
have you ever asked yourself why I'm still here?
I'm here because…
you can't let me go.
You'd rather live with your pain
than live alone.
Weren't you the one who said we were soulmates?
Who left first?
Didn't you give up on me first?
Mae.
Look. You're still holding on to my things.
Even your parents' stuff.
It's too crowded here.
Do you think we're still in those boxes?
Do you think you can still bring us back?
Shut up, Mark. Why do you care?
Have you really asked yourself why I'm here?
You're holding on to the past because that's all you have.
And you're holding on to me,
even though there's a wide and beautiful world out there for you.
I'm not saying it's bad to remember us. Me and your family.
You know what's bad?
It's that you want us to be with you
even if we're just figments of your imagination.
Because you're afraid to be alone.
You're longing for sympathy.
And who's going to give it to you? Us?
Do you see yourself right now? You keep begging for love.
Is that what you want?
You're like a newborn.
"Baby…" "Don't want!" "Baby, baby."
"Don't want!" "Oh, here, here." "Don't want!"
You're exhausting.
You leave nothing for us.
And even if we've given you everything, it will never be enough
because you don't know how to love yourself.
You can't stand on your own and find a way to live
because you're a coward! A coward!
I am not a coward.
-You are! Coward! -I'm not. I'm done.
Hey. You can't live without me, Mae.
This is how you want things.
I'm done with this.
Hey.
Mae!
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
What are you planning to do?
Are you cleaning up?
You are cleaning up!
Here we go again with the things you start doing, but won't be able to finish.
And I think this will take long.
Because this is a big pile of trash like your life!
Come on.
Tell me.
Why are you cleaning up?
Because I'm tired.
We're done.
No. Wait a minute, Mae!
Mae! Hold on a minute! Mae!
You need me, Mae!
I don't need you.
-You still love me! -No, I don't.
Mae, please don't do this. Wait, Mae! Please.
You need me, don't you?
-I don't need you. -You need me because…
No! Mae!
Mae!
Mae!
What? You think you're strong enough?
You can't do it! You're weak!
I can if I want to, Mark.
Mae…
Hey! Mae! What the hell is that?
Come on, please.
Don't do this!
Mae! Don't do this! Mae!
Mae!
YOU
Let me help you, Auntie.
SENTIMENTAL
Well? Are you here to invite me to your wedding?
Yes.
In my dreams.
If I tell you
that you were right,
will you forgive me?
Mae.
You're not stupid.
He's just really not into you.
I can't believe it.
I was really in pain at that time.
I felt betrayed.
That he was being taken away.
But the truth is,
I was really the villain in their story.
I just followed my heart.
Does that make me a bad person?
You know, before he came into my life,
I always felt like I had nothing.
I had no one.
Then he came along and completed everything.
Before, I couldn't handle it.
I would always say,
"I should always have somebody. I should always have someone."
I couldn't admit to myself
that I self-loathe when I'm alone.
-You are enough. -That hurt.
Always remember that.
Even when everyone is gone, you will still have yourself.
Why, Auntie?
Are you content with just yourself?
Yes, I am.
How so?
You'll get used to it.
I'll get used to it? That's brutal.
Power.
The power of peace.
Auntie.
Take a bite.
The barbecue cut.
Just half a kilo. Yes.
-Mark. -Mae.
How are you?
I'm doing okay.
What are you doing here?
Praying.
Just kidding. I'm grabbing some groceries.
Did Jenny ask you to buy those?
Seems like you're cooking.
But you don't know how to cook.
I can still cook better than you.
Fine, I won't argue with that.
Congratulations on your T-shirt business.
I saw it online. People are raving about it on social media.
Really?
I'm glad that you and Jenny are still together.
Mae.
I was avoiding you all this time.
Now I'm starting a family, I want to tie loose ends.
It's okay.
It's already out of my mind.
Just kidding.
I forgive you.
It means a lot to hear that from you.
Take care.
-You too! -Bye.
Mae.
I hope I don't remind you of only bad memories.
We had our happy days, didn't we?
Of course.
-Bye. -Take care.

THANKS
Ma'am, the courier is on its way.
Are we going to include these new orders for delivery?
It's cut-off time. Tomorrow.
Okay, ma'am.
Norman is happy.
It's like we're playing patintero.
Wait. Don't move.
Okay.
Where did he go?
He's cute.
Patintero cutie.
-[woman] He hit his head. -[man] He did not.
-[woman] Did he hit his head? -[man] I caught him in time.
[woman] But he hit the floor. I saw him.
-Dropped him. -[man] I promise you, he's fine.
-[woman] Why isn't he crying? -[snipping]
-He should be crying, right? -[man] He will be crying in no time.
[woman] Where are you taking him? Where are you taking him?
What is--? What is wrong? Why isn't he breathing?
-Did you kill him?! Did you kill my baby?! -[man] No!
-[woman] Did you drop him? -[man] No!
-[woman] You made me have him. -[man] Nurse, are you getting him?
[nurse] Yes, we are. We vacuumed him.
[woman] Why are you flinging him?
I accidentally drank mouthwash Friday night.
You can't get stomach cancer that way.
Not from one time.
I drank a mouthful a couple weeks ago too.
I'm sure it's fine.
I'm visiting my mother tomorrow.
I know you are. Your father's anniversary.
The day he died.
How you feeling about that?
You know. I never met him.
I meant, how you feeling about going home?
I had the dream again.
[Friel] Let's stay on track.
How are you feeling about the trip?
It's good I'm going back.
It's been a long time.
Has it?
Several months.
Are you feeling guilty about that?
And, um...
when you're out there,
are you going with any sense of a plan?
Hoping for a certain outcome?
Like what?
Do you feel like you're going with realistic expectations?
If the last time you were thirsty,
you went to a well and the water made you sick,
are you gonna go back to that specific well,
expecting it to be safe?
Do you ever wish that she was dead?
What? Of course not.
But it wouldn't be so crazy if you did.
We can sort of want these things and also not want them at all.
Those feelings can coexist.
We're here so we can air those kinds of thoughts.
Okay.
How's the Hydrotipnol? Still making the eyes itchy?
Only if I don't keep blinking.
Is it helping the anxiety?
Tell you what.
I'm gonna write you a scrip for a very cool new drug,
which, I think, should be smoother on all fronts.
Always with water.
Always. And if your breathing changes or you feel warm, call me immediately.
That's serious.
Break a leg.
-[ethereal music playing] -[on recording] Hi, Carrot, it's Mom.
I'm just calling to say that I'm so, so, so excited to see you tomorrow.
-Joseph? -You're my angel and I love you.
Okay. I love you. Okay, bye, sweetie.
I love you.
Listen to your mother when I tell you to not leave my sight!
Hello. Could I please see this one?
-That one? -[man yells] You think I won't?
Do you fucking want me to do it?
Oh, yeah?
Excuse me!
[Beau] Excuse me. What is that man doing?
We're trying to get him to jump. [laughs]
[man 1] Dumb bitch! Fuck you!
[man 2] Get away from me.
Get away from me!
You get away from me!
Get away!
You look like a minestrone man.
[man 2] Stay away!
-It's hot! -[woman] We're running low on crackers.
Hey, Dad.
...search continues for the man known as "Birthday Boy Stab Man,"
who in the last week has claimed three more lives.
He is known for prowling the streets without clothes
and stabbing random pedestrians in the neck and guts.
Witnesses have identified him as a circumcised white male--
Hello?
[man] Turn it down! I need to sleep!
[man] How about this?
Excuse me, sir? My bag and my key were just here.
You're fucked, pal. [chuckles]
[Beau] Hey, wait a minute. Why would you say that?
[woman] Hello?
Oh, hi, Mrs. Wolski.
This is Beau Wassermann from Apartment 303.
-I'm calling because my keys were-- -No solicitors!
No, I'm sorry. I'm not a solicitor, I'm one of your tenants.
I need a locksmith. I'm late for the airport. -Thank you. -Hello?
-Thank you. -Hello?
Hello.
-[Martha] Hello? -Hi, Martha. I'm sorry, is Mom there?
Beau! Sweetie! Yes, she's right here.
[woman] Beau?
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Carrot. Are you at the airport?
No, not yet.
Are you on your way?
-In the cab? How long is the cab ride? -No, Mom.
Mom, I don't want to worry you. I was on my way.
But something-- I don't know.
I was up all night because my neighbor kept leaving notes
underneath my door about noise, even though I didn't make any noise.
And I overslept and when I went to leave, I forgot something, I went back in.
And then I came back out and my key was stolen out of my door.
Oh, my God.
So, where are you calling me from now?
My apartment.
Wait. What time is it? Isn't it 4:30?
Yeah, I know.
Baby, your flight is in an hour!
I know, but, Mom, my key got stolen out of my door.
Mom?
Mom?
Okay, sweetheart. I understand.
Wait, what's okay? No, it's not. What do you understand?
No, of course it isn't. Your keys are stolen. That's terrible.
They were stolen.
Then we'll just do another visit another time.
I can even come to you so it's not such a pain.
It's not a pain.
It's never a pain.
You know what, I can still just come to you.
I'm still coming, I'm on my way. I just...
What do you think I should do?
What do you think I should do?
I'm sure you'll do the right thing, sweetheart.
What is the right thing?
What would be the right thing for you?
Do I call the police?
Or maybe there's a way for me to just still come home now.
But is that safe?
If my apartment's open to the public and somebody has my keys,
I don't know what's going on.
That doesn't sound safe. It's not safe, is it?
-Beau... -What?
Beau.
Yeah?
I'm sorry about your keys. I have to go.
No, you don't have to go.
-I hope you find them. -Mom.
Wait, wait. Come on, let's fix this. Let's fix this.
Hello?
[woman] Who turned the water off? Turn the fucking water on!
[Friel] Always with water.
Always...
Always...
Always...
-Help me. Help me. -[gunshot]
Help me. Help me. Help me.
Declined.
What? No, it's not. Can you try again, please?
Oh, no.
[cashier] No good.
Oh, God. How much?
You drank already. You owe $1.79.
$1.79.
[Beau] Oh, no.
-I call the police. -No, no, look, I'm paying! I'm paying!
-[cashier] Thirty cents more. -[Beau] Oh!
Oh, God.
[cashier] Twenty now.
-[Beau] Oh, my God. -[cashier] Twenty.
-I know! -Don't curse me, my friend.
I'm not the one.
-[Beau] Oh, my God. -[cashier] Five more now.
There!
I call the police!
Mrs. Wolski?
[man] Stay away from me! Stay away! You stay away!
-[Beau] Oh, no. -[man] Get away from me!
-[Beau] Oh! -[man] Get away!
Get back. Stay away.
Get back!
-[yelling continues] -[Latin music playing over speakers]
[man] Fuck you! Fuck you!
[man] Fuck, it's hot.
Hello?
Sir?
Hello?
[on recording] Hi, you've reached Mona.
Leave me a message if you ever wanna speak to me again.
Hi, Mom.
So, I'm trying to book a flight for tonight,
but the credit card got declined.
[automated voice] We're sorry. Your message did not go through.
Please hang up and try again.
[man] Hello?
Hello?
I'm sorry. Who is this?
Uh-- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm trying to call my Mom.
This is your mom's number?
Mm. Yeah, it is.
Who's this?
I'm with UPS.
Um, I don't know whose phone this is. I just called the police.
They're already on their way.
Okay.
Why?
Hello?
Can you maybe describe your mother to me?
Brown eyes. Red-brown hair.
Okay.
Can you maybe describe her physique?
Wait, what's going on?
Why are you calling the police?
Listen, I don't know what this is.
I have a package and I only came in
because of the smell and the dogs on the block were all going crazy,
and the door was open, so I just barely came inside, but, um...
there's a lady on the floor.
Well, the body of a lady, and there's no face or head.
What?
I don't think I should've answered this.
The police are coming.
This isn't my phone. I'm truly just finding this.
I'm sorry, you don't-- Makes any sense.
What do you mean, there's no face or head? For who?
I mean, I'm sure there is.
I'm sure it's here. I'm sure it's everywhere.
A chandelier...
fell on top of it.
And it looks like it dropped off the ceiling and it fell on a woman.
And it smashed her head. Like, it evaporated.
But who is it?
What?
Who is it?
I don't know, I'm trying to be tactful. You're saying this could be your mom?
What? I didn't say that.
Why are you saying that?
No, you said that to me. Look, you asked if your mother was here.
That's what I'm saying. I don't know who this is!
I just picked up the phone and that's what you said.
I didn't do this! I didn't do this! You know?
I swear.
Maybe you called the wrong number.
Did you dial this number?
It's saved in my phone.
It's saved on your phone? Okay, maybe you misdialed.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Right? Maybe you misdialed. Maybe this is all a big misunderstanding.
-So, we should hang up... -Okay.
-...then maybe your mom will pick up. -Okay.
Okay. Hang up. Call back.
[man] I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Do I have your permission to check her purse for some ID?
Since it's more likely now that this is your mom?
Hello?
Is her name...
Mona Wassermann?
That your mother?
Hello?
-Mona Wassermann, is that your mom? -[wheezing]
Hey.
Hey.
Is somebody there?
[on recording] Hi, you've reached Dr. Jeremy Friel.
Please leave a message and I'll return your call
as soon as I'm able.
I'm so sorry.
[man] Please.
Please.
[Beau] Help!
Help! Help!
-[Latin music playing over speakers] -Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
Police! Oh, my God!
Police!
-Police, please help, will you? -Freeze!
There's a man in my bath and a man with a knife!
-[officer] Freeze! -What?
Freeze. Drop the weapon. Drop it!
Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon!
Drop the weapon! Drop it!
Drop the weapon! Drop it!
Fuck it. What? Do not move.
I fucking said, do not move!
-Freeze! -I'm freezing. I'm freezing.
-I said, fucking freeze! -I'm not moving!
-I'm not gonna say it again. -I'm frozen!
Oh, my God, don't make me do this. Do not make me do this, please.
Oh, please, please, please don't make me do this.
No! No! No!
-Don't make me do this! -[screaming]
[woman] I'm coming!
Roger, he's awake!
Did you hit the button?
Are you awake?
How are you feeling?
-[thermometer beeps] -[mumbling] Strange.
I bet. You've been sleeping for two days.
What?
Did I get hit with a car?
There was an accident, yes.
Oh, goodness. Uh, I hit you with my car.
Is that this?
There was a stabbing.
You were assaulted.
What?
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
Why? Why?
-What? -I know.
-Am I dead? -No.
No. You've been healing so quickly.
And no organs were hit, and your bleeding was really mild.
What--? This is a room, this?
This is a room in our house.
But it's your home for as long as you need.
-My name's Grace. -[knocking on door]
Oh, this is Roger.
This is my husband.
Hey, guy. Welcome back.
Thought you'd sleep in, huh?
[Grace] Roger's a very respected surgeon.
He's the one who dressed and treated your wounds.
You're a lucky man.
What is--? What is this?
That's my little assistant health monitor. Keeps track of your condition.
Was that a dream before?
-What is--? -Was that a dream?
-The stabbing? -No, my mom.
-Your...? -My mommy.
Your mommy?
Is my mommy dead?
What was your dream, sweetie?
[sobs] Her head, it was just gone.
-Her what? -Her head.
Oh, no, no. That's a dream. That was a dream.
-No, her head is gone. -Oh. Shh.
No, no, no. That's a bad dream.
It's okay. Shh. That's a bad dream.
-There you go. Oh, no. -My mommy.
Just a dream. It's just a dream.
Amen?
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
That's Nate. Our boy.
Nathan.
He's Army?
Eighty-second Airborne Division. Caracas.
Killed in action.
Where's that?
[Roger] Oh, is it time for dessert already?
Here you go.
And, uh...
two for the big man.
By the way, Beau. Uh...
Not for the dinner table, but, uh, I noticed when you first came in...
your testicles are significantly distended.
-Mm. -Looks like a bad case of epididymitis.
Let him eat, Roger.
But we should get an ultrasound, just to be safe.
[Grace] Oh, Toni!
Ton-- Come here.
-Come here. -[Roger] Oh, she's not dead. That's nice.
[Grace] Come in here.
I want you to meet our new friend.
Beau, this is Toni.
Toni, this is Beau.
Oh, hello.
You enjoying my bed and all my stuff?
-What? That's your bedroom? -[Roger] Oh, God. Here we go.
I didn't realize that. I'm...
Beau, take it easy. Toni's happy to give you her room.
Yeah, no. It's not like we have a totally empty room available,
completely unused.
That's right. It's not like that. You know that.
I'm going to school.
Honey, it's Saturday.
-Don't mix those, Toni! -[door slams]
Little asshole.
Okay, so you wanna dial nine and then you're good.
Do you have the number you need?
My mom made me memorize it.
Hi, Jeeves.
Uh, Jeeves, um, he...
Jeeves and my son served together in Caracas.
He was with him when he died.
Oh, that's gonna be blood.
-Did you give him his meds? -I thought you did!
All right.
If you need anything, just shout.
Stay right there, Jeeves. Sweetie, don't touch anything.
[man] Hello?
Dr. Cohen?
I'm not a doctor, Beau. I'm an attorney.
I'm calling about Mom.
Is it true?
Is what true?
That she was discovered with a collapsed head in her living room?
That you were the first person notified
and it's taken three days for anyone to hear from you?
Yes, Beau.
It's true.
But how? I was just speaking with her.
I was coming to see her. -I was coming to see her. What...? -Shh!
What...? What happened?
Am I the first person you're asking?
A chandelier crushed her head!
Hello?
Oh, my God.
Hello?
What do I do?
What...?
Do...?
Do--? Do I call the funeral people?
About what?
Do I need to...?
Everyone was contacted on the day that she was found.
The burial has been outrageously postponed.
So...
when...?
When is it now?
A body is to be buried immediately, Beau.
"It shall not remain all night," does that ring a bell?
Do you understand anything?
I just woke up.
-I got hit by a car and I got stabbed. -[Jeeves yells]
It was your mother's unfortunate wish
that she not be buried without you present.
So, we are waiting, Beau.
And every minute more that we wait only deepens the humiliation.
Okay.
Your mother's body is being watched at all hours.
There is no rest for her.
There has been no rest for the people that love her.
You need to be here, Beau, dressed in a suit, with a eulogy.
You need to stop the humiliation. It's all that's being asked of you.
We'll keep an eye out for Your Highness's royal carriage.
Was that okay?
No, I...
I-- I need to get home.
I have to get back. [whimpers]
Baby.
-[Beau] I have to get back. -[Roger] Paging Dr. Roge.
Dr. Roge incoming.
-All right, bub. A little medley here. -[Beau] I just need to go.
-Now, will you take me? -Under the tongue.
-Come on. Attaboy. -[Beau] Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
How's our patient?
-He needs to get back. -Oh, I need to go now.
Is there a flight tonight or this afternoon?
Oh, sweetheart, this is the afternoon.
Okay, well, can we order one or...?
Whoa, partner! Partner, hold your horses.
-He can't fly in his condition. -Yeah, I was gonna say.
-What's the problem, old buddy? -She needs to be buried.
They're waiting for me.
[sobbing] She's humiliated. She's humiliated. Oh, so much.
Beau, listen.
There's nothing worse than losing a parent.
I lost my mother when I was 11.
I don't think I ever got over it.
But I promise you, we will get you there, easy.
Wasserton's only like a six-hour drive from here.
Can you take me now?
But you also need to get some serious rest, my brother.
-No! I feel fine. -And some support.
When can you take me?
-Couple of days. Then... -What?
Then, after the show, we can all swing back here together.
-Roger, Roger, please. -As a family.
Please, I need to get back now.
[Grace] Beau, if you need to get home ASAP,
we're just gonna have to find a way to take you tomorrow.
[Beau] What?
Tomorrow? Not--? Not--? No. But today? Why not today?
You're right, honey. Tomorrow.
-[Beau sobs] -Oh, babers.
Why not today?
[Roger] Not in this condition.
[Grace] One more red and blue.
Here. I found it.
[Roger] All right. It's beddy-byes for the Roge-man.
Where's my blushing bride?
Whoo-hoo? Babe?
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just going to the bathroom.
Would you like to trade?
I really don't mind.
Shut my door and get in my bed.
I really, really, really don't mind, really. I like couches.
And I'm leaving tomorrow anyway.
Well, if you do change your mind, I'm ready to switch whenever.
I'll be happy to. I'm sorry. Thank you. Sorry.
[Toni] Now, where the fuck is it?
He touched it. Why would you touch someone else's shit?
He moved my toothbrush. He used...
-Did he fucking use my toothbrush? -Today's the day, Beau. How's it feel?
Is he okay like me?
Eh, probably.
[Grace] It's just his nerves, Beau. He's been through a lot. Just like you.
Man's a hero.
Okay, pally-o, it's you and me.
Grace, unfortunately, can't join. She's got her big shareholder meeting.
You feeling sad about going home, Beau?
Must feel totally unreal.
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know.
Right. So, not sad, exactly.
I mean, yes. Of course, I just...
I think I need to get there to even...
Hey, that makes sense. That makes all the sense in the world.
Hello?
Speaking.
When did it happen?
Water skiing?
[groans] Well, yes, no, of course. Tell them to rush him over.
Oh, my God.
Emergency surgery. Carl Oberst split his head open.
-[Grace gasps] -One of my oldest patients.
[Grace] Well, I can't miss work today, it's all hands on deck. -[Roger sighs] -[Grace] Oh, my gosh, Carl.
-[Roger sighs] -[Grace] Oh, my gosh, Carl.
[Roger] I know. Good old Carl.
Okay. Okay.
Beau...
this is gonna take a while.
I don't know if today's gonna happen.
Okay.
What do you mean?
I wanna say tonight,
but I already pushed this morning's surgeries to tomorrow.
But if I pull them all back to this afternoon,
we could blast off tomorrow morning.
No, but I have to go today.
I have to leave today. My mother-- [yells, then groans]
-See? -[Beau gasps]
-[Roger] Uh-uh. -[Grace gasps] Oh, Beau.
[Roger] You aren't healed, my dude.
Not to mention...
Maybe there's a way.
Since you're busy, maybe I can... I can fly.
I fly and I can pay you back when I get my credit card.
It isn't about the money, Beau. You can't fly with your wounds.
The air pressure will rip you wide open.
Maybe I can take a bus. I can take a bus. Can I take a bus?
I could take a train. Or a cab?
Beau, we're responsible for you.
Driving you home is the absolute least we can do.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm sorry, but I have to go today. I have to go today.
I don't wanna impose.
Going tomorrow won't be an imposition.
It'll be my pleasure.
Okay?
Okay.
Is it, Beau?
Don't just say that.
This is your decision.
Thanks, pal. You're a trouper. Sorry for the curveball, Beau.
Wait, don't you need to stitch me up?
Ah, it's fine.
Just cut back on the jumping jacks, you know what I mean?
In the meantime, my man, this is your home.
I need to run too, sweetie.
-There's-- -[Roger] Oh!
And I'm giving Jeeves his medicine,
so if you hear him screaming, he's just asleep.
-Don't forget to hydrate. -What?
[Grace] Drink lots of water.
[Roger] We're taking you back tomorrow!
[Grace] Goodbye, sweetie.
[Roger] Tomorrow.
What?
What does this mean?
Wait! What does that mean?
[Roger] Shake a leg.
[on recording] You've reached the office of Harold Cohen.
Leave a detailed message. I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
Hey, Dr. Cohen. It's Beau.
I'm on my way.
[automated voice] The mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages--
[man on video] Our senior correspondent Brian Galloway joins us now.
Brian, what have we learned?
All we know at the moment
is that Mona Wassermann was found dead in the living room of her magnificent home
with a chandelier where one's head should be.
Due to extenuating circumstances, she has not yet been buried.
But she must. She was 70 years old.
[man] Excuse me, sir, you discovered the body?
I never would've gone inside if, uh, the dogs hadn't been going nuts
and I hadn't smelled that smell and the door hadn't been open.
That's the only reason I went inside.
Admired by her friends and feared by her competitors,
Mona Wassermann was a local industry titan and a force to be reckoned with.
I just can't believe it.
[Brian] Mona Wassermann has been--
Wait.
What the fuck?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was on your computer. I threw up.
I'll clean it up. I'll clean up. I'll clean it up better than before.
[Toni] We're leaving.
What?
I'm taking you home.
What about Roger taking me?
Who the fuck do you think told me to take you?
Meet my new brother.
I'm just Grace and Roger's friend. Hi.
Look at this.
I don't even care. He just threw up on my fucking computer.
Thank you. Thank you for taking me.
Taking him where?
Aren't you a little old to be getting adopted?
I'm not adopted.
[Toni] Yeah, you are.
To him.
No, thank you.
[Toni] Dad told me you need to smoke it.
[Beau] What?
[Toni] It's for your healing. He says you need to relax.
That's okay. Really. Thank you.
I already took some pills.
[Toni] Um, no.
Actually, it's not okay, really, thank you.
Your new dad says that your pills aren't enough
and you need to smoke this with your little sister.
Please. I really can't do this.
I just saw something very confusing and I just need to get home.
Look, you smoke it and we take you home.
You don't and we don't. That's it.
Okay.
Then I'll just wait for Roger to take me.
Can you please open the door?
If you don't do it right now,
I'm gonna make her pull my hair so hard that it detaches my scalp,
and she'll say that you did it.
[Liz] I will.
I remember that you did. I saw it.
You taking advantage of us.
What's in it?
[Toni] It's three things.
Okay, thank you.
[Toni] Do it actually.
Please. That was enough.
[Toni] Harder.
Keep going.
Don't stop. -[grunts]
Don't cough. Don't--
[Toni] Dude.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
[Toni] I'll take this.
Wait, what...?
-What is that? What...? -[Toni] What is that?
-All right, can you please open...? -[Liz] Your brother is fucked.
Can you open the window, please? [whimpers]
[Liz] Yeah, bitch. Hit that.
Oh, my God.
Wait, what is in that?
[Toni] You saw what Sarah posted? [Liz] Oh, my God. What a lying, little bitch.
[Toni] Bet she never even met that guy.
[Liz] You need to raise your price for this. Can you die from this?
Can you die from this?
-What? I don't know. Wait. Wait. [whines] -[unsettling music playing]
-I don't want to... -[Liz] Dude, I'm still so fucking pissed.
[Toni] Yeah, whatever.
[Liz] This is like the fifth time.
[Toni] It is not the fifth. It's like the second.
[Liz] I don't care.
Not even a D, a D-plus. Just give me a fucking C-minus.
-[Toni] It's 'cause he wants you. -[Liz] He should be fired for wanting me.
[Toni] Oh, my God, he would totally not survive it.
He's like a thousand years old.
[Liz] Oh, my God. What if we killed him by getting him fired?
[Beau] The car is getting smaller.
Wait, that's the house again. We just passed your house.
-Hey! -What?!
What?
[woman] Do you miss Martha, Beau?
Of course. I love Martha.
You love Martha?
She's my friend.
I like her.
Ah, see, Beau? You're not the only kid here.
You know what I've been through.
-You tell me what to do. -You can't even pay for it.
[girl] There's a dead man in the pool!
There's a dead man in the pool!
There's a dead man in the pool!
There's a dead man in the pool!
There's a dead man in the pool!
There's a dead man in the pool!
So, you're just here with your mom? [Young Beau] Only sometimes. Right now I'm by myself.
I'm Elaine.
I'm Beau.
I'm Elaine.
[Young Beau] Are you here with your mother?
[Elaine] Yeah.
She got me, and my dad got our rich whore neighbor,
who he's probably fucking right now on a pile of her slut money in Aruba.
Here, take a picture of me and Gene.
[Mona] Is that the type of girl you're attracted to?
[Young Beau] No.
[Mona] Because I've noticed you noticing certain types.
It's okay if you are.
You don't have to feel embarrassed.
I'm not.
[Mona] She's very pretty.
Very natural.
You could ask my advice, you know.
Only women know women.
That's the truth.
Men are blind.
That's not a criticism. That's their charm.
Don't be defensive.
I'm proud of the man you are.
Hey.
I'm proud of the man you are.
A girl like that...
Confident, self-possessed.
A man would have to match her.
But you could.
She should be so lucky.
Any woman would be so lucky.
You just have to commit completely.
Nothing in life is more important than choosing the right companion.
Hey, my dude. Long time no see.
-How was your day? -[Grace] How are you feeling?
Oh, good, you're already in your PJs. Well, we're hot on your tail. [chuckles]
[Mona] I think I might go to bed early.
[Young Beau] Okay.
[Mona] I haven't decided yet.
Unless you'd rather I stay up.
We could stroll around the deck.
Go stargazing.
I'll go to bed.
What about éclairs?
People hide razors in them.
What about rainbow cake?
The colors make cancer.
What about liquid shit?
Do you think your mom's a cunt?
What do you mean?
Well, it's okay. My mom's a complete cunt.
Are you a virgin?
Well, it doesn't matter. I am too. I mean, who gives a shit?
I have to.
It's very dangerous for me. It's genetic.
My father died.
Here.
-Suck this off. -What?
What?
What?
We're allowed to kiss.
Who is?
-But only for the next ten seconds. -What do you mean?
Ten. Nine.
-Eight. Seven. -What? Wait.
-Six. Five. -We're allowed to...?
-Four. Three. -Can you just explain?
Two. One. One and a half. One and three-quarters.
I'm sorry.
Elaine!
Shit. Fuck. I gotta go.
Okay. I'm sorry.
-Tomorrow? -Now!
-[gasps] -[Toni] You should be in my bed!
He's breaking your rules! Hypocrite!
[Roger yells] You wanna test me, young lady?
Jeeves!
He's inside!
Beau's inside!
-Beau, Beau, Beau. They're taking me away. -[screaming]
Beau, wake up. She's taking me away. She's taking me off the ship.
Beau, wake up. She's taking me away. She's taking me off the ship. -[Mona] What's happening? -She's taking me away.
-[Mona] What's happening? -She's taking me away.
-Will you wait for me? -[Mona] What is going on?
-Will you wait for me? -[Young Beau] What's happening?
I love you.
[Mona] Oh, my God.
Why are you doing this?
What is this?
-Will you wait for me? -Yes.
Promise? Do you promise? Promise me!
-Okay? -I promise.
-Enough! -Who is this bitch?
-[woman] I'm sorry. -What is this?
No! No! No!
Beau, I love you, okay?
-Come here right now! -Wait for me. Wait for me, okay?
-Shut up! -Oh, my God!
-[Elaine] Wait for me! -[Mona] My heart.
-My heart. My heart. -[woman] What's wrong with you?
[Mona] What did you promise her, Beau?
Beau!
Where is she going, Beau? Was she the one?
[Roger] No, no! Put that down!
-He's on the couch! -[Jeeves] He's inside!
[Grace] Okay, okay, okay.
That's him! That's him!
-That's enough! -[Roger] No need to get up, Beau!
-Stay in bed! Stay in bed! -[Grace] All right.
He's laughing! He's laughing!
-He's laughing! -Don't worry, Beau. False alarm.
[Grace] It's okay, Beau. He doesn't know what he's doing.
It's all under control.
-Okay. -[Jeeves] He's laughing!
[Grace] When they rescued him in the jungle,
they found him running around, shooting at the bodies.
And not at... Not the enemy, his own squad too.
[Roger] His own squad, Beau.
[Grace] He was defending himself. He still is.
He's a hero and he came back to nothing.
We're the only ones who would take him in.
[Roger] He's gonna be so ashamed in the morning, Beau.
Mark my words.
He loves you.
[fading] He told me he loves you. He told me yesterday.
[Grace] That's not part of the original contract.
I'm a mother myself, you know.
In that case, I might have to...
Look alive, pal! It's grill time.
I thought we'd have a little goodbye barbecue
before we hit the road.
What?
You got the tri-tip.
Good morning, sweetheart. How are you feeling?
-[Roger] You coming, Gracey? -Right there.
Let's get you up.
Baby.
There you go. There we go.
As someone who sees you and loves you and knows what you're going through,
even though I know I can never know, I have to tell you...
[Roger] Babers?
You mind coming out here for a sec? I need a hand.
Of course.
Why don't you find something to watch?
I'll be right back.
Channel 78.
[Toni screams] Now!
What? What is...?
What?
What? What?
We're gonna finally put some color on these walls.
What?
Here. Take that wall.
That wall!
Okay.
Yeah, how about this?
Please. What...?
What are you doing? Why are you doing this?
-Hey, Grace is so careful about this room. -It's my brother!
I know. So, why?
Okay.
-Yeah... -What?
[Toni] Yeah, you know what?
You'll just get fucked up with me.
-I'm supposed to be leaving. -So, you'll leave fucked up.
No, I feel really bad right now, please!
So, what, you can come into my life and sleep in my bed
and steal my fucking parents, but you can't get fucked up with me?
No! I'm not trying to steal anything, I swear!
No, you've already blown it! You failed your stupid test!
What?
Everyone pretending you're some sad, old orphan.
-It makes me puke! -Wait. Wait. What do you mean?
I'm sorry. Please...
I'll leave. I'll do whatever you want. But what does that mean?
-What do you mean, a test? -No one is asking you to leave.
I'm asking you to fucking drink this fucking paint with me.
-Toni, please. -Don't call me Toni!
I'm sorry, but it's your name.
It is my name. It's my name.
What did you mean when you said that about the test?
-What does that mean? -I don't care! You first.
Don't. Toni, please.
You listen to me.
I have videos of you. I'll post them. I'll say what you did.
What? What did I do? What did I do?
-Fine, you fucking pussy, faggot. -No, please, Toni, don't!
Stop, please! You're gonna be sick!
Stop! Stop!
Fuck you!
[Beau] Help! Help! Doctor!
Help! [sobbing]
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
She drank. She drank it.
-No. What did you do to her?! -She drank it.
No. I didn't. I tried to get her to stop.
I begged her, "Please stop doing it."
Come on, Toni. No, no, no, Toni.
No. No. Come on, baby.
I didn't. I didn't. I told her not to.
I begged her.
[Grace] Come on. No!
Come on, baby. Come on.
I see you now!
What?
Replacing my son...
-with a demon. -No, no. No, Grace.
With a demon! [screaming]
-I'll kill you! -No! Please, no!
-I'll kill you! -No. Oh, my God.
This ends up bad. It's bad. It's bad. Totally bad.
[Grace] Jeeves!
Rip him apart!

[Beau] Hello? I'm...
I'm sorry, I'm lost.
I was in an accident. And I don't...
I don't know where I am.
I'm sorry, but can you please help me?
Are you hurt?
That's a very big piece of glass in your head.
Glass?
Oh, it was a door.
I think we should take it out. Can I take it out?
-Oh, God. Oh. -Okay. Okay. Okay.
-It's bleeding a lot? -It's okay.
The head ones, they bleed like crazy and then they just stop.
-Is it? Is it stopped? -Mm-hm. It is?
-See? -Is it?
Trust me. My father bled to death.
We should clean it up. It could still get infected.
You wanna come with me?
Okay.
Thank you.
We're nearly there.
[pregnant woman] Hi, Lloyd.
-This is Beau. -[Beau] Hello.
[pregnant woman] He was in an accident.
His mother just died and his father died before he was born.
When sorrows come,
they come not single spies, but in battalions.
[Beau] Thank you.
[pregnant woman] This is me. Just a sec, Beau.
[man 1] ...sweeping changes day before the show, and then wonders why it's not right.
Everything was right. It was right for months.
You aren't set?
I have an extra sleeping bag if you need one.
This way, Beau.

[man 3] Damn these crossroads!
How can one stake one's life on a choice between two unmarked paths?
[man 4] If one leads forward, must the other go backwards?
-[woman] If it were a trap? -[man 4] Or this an opportunity?
Or might they both lead home,
where I can take my rightful seat
and be lord of my own possessions?
They're rehearsing for the preview.
[man 3] Damn these crossroads!
There, let's not spoil it.
[man 4] As great trumpets speak, our poor hero realizes too late:
But these are funeral horns!
[pregnant woman] Everyone?
This is Beau.
-[man 4] Hi, Beau. -[man 3] Hi, Beau.
-[woman] Hi, Beau. -[man 3] Hello.
He was in an accident, and both his parents are dead.
-[man 3] No! -[man 4] Are you okay?
[man 3] That's terrible.
What is this place?
We call ourselves the Orphans of the Forest.
[Ladybug Man] That's right.
Although many of our parents simply abandoned us
without even bothering to die.
We're a traveling theater company.
We go from forest to forest, off the grid, making up homes from whatever we find.
[Ladybug Man] And then at the end, we put on a big show!
I'm so sorry.
See him?
That's Yesekov.
He's the man who started all of this.
[boy] Papa...
It's time for the show.
Hi there. Are you joining us?
-What do you mean? -Do you want a costume?
We like to blur the line between the audience and the players.
Either of these?
I like this color with your eyes. Or this one's fun.
-That one. -That's my favorite too.
Let's get changed.
[pregnant woman] I'm happy you're joining, Beau.
Hey there, brother, I'm Duncan. What brought you here?
[Grace] Jeeves! Rip him apart!
What am I doing here?
Tell me, what am I doing here?
[man] No!
Oh, God...
Fate has burned my house to cinders and launched me into exile.
I once thought I knew despair, and that I could master it...
but now that I know this pain,
I can't fathom relief.
When I reach out for answers,
I grasp cold air.
[sobs] O, with my mother and father gone,
I have lost my whole self!
You grieve well.
Your parents are honored
and now may rest forever in peace.
Rise.
Now go forth.
Erect your own glittering home...
and make it permanent.
Do I venture forth...
or stay here?
With what I know.
If I stay, I die.
No. I must go.
What? Chains?
-[grunts] -Now you see.
They have always been there.
[angel] Yes. Push forward.
Pray that you learn valor and be given luck.
You will walk many miles.
Dozens will become hundreds.
Hundreds will become thousands.
You will pass through countless villages.
But, finally, one village will speak to you,
some deep, essential part of you will recognize it,
and you will say, "This village is mine."
You will learn a trade...
and eventually earn a living.
You will know the pleasure of tasting fruit
and bread and wine that is yours,
because you have earned it.
You will find a plot of land and build a house with your own hands.
You will cultivate the land.
You will live off it.
You will come to make new friends.
One day, you will meet a woman.
The story of your meeting will change according to who tells it:
That you were lost and she helped you find your way,
or that she was off-course and you guided her home.
She will see your fears and your pain
and your dreams and your potential...
and you will see hers.
In finding your other half, the gifts of your life will multiply.
Sometimes she will look like a man to you.
She will become pregnant because you have sex with her.
You will have children. Three sons.
You will teach them what you know,
and you will tell them you love them every day.
They will grow into handsome boys,
blessed with courage and kindness and ambition.
You will share your feelings of pride with your therapist.
He will archive them.
One day, an historic storm will sweep through your village
and destroy your home.
You will be carried away by a great flood.
You and your family will be separated...
and you will be deposited in a strange country.
You will look for your family for days...
then weeks...
then months.
So many months that you will come to lose count,
but you will not find them.
You will try to find work to support your continuing search,
but no one will speak your language.
You will be treated like a criminal.
Eventually, you will come upon a village wracked by an inexplicable plague.
As you pass through, a man deranged by tragedy
will identify you as the beast who burned down his home
and replaced his children's feet with their hands.
You will try to argue your innocence,
but this will only make you sound more guilty.
You will wonder yourself whether you are guilty.
You will flee.
Mad with vengeance,
they will send an attack dog to pursue you.
It will tear through the world to find you.
You won't know this, but you will sense it.
And you will keep a detailed record of these impressions in a log.
And over time, this log will become many logs.
Your adventures will continue for years and years.
You will learn to distinguish birds by their call,
and you will know every tree and plant by its name.
Abandoning all comforts,
you will condition your mind to new ways of seeing.
You will experience great highs and profound lows,
and you will look for your family
until your life shrinks and fades into the dream of a ghost.
You will come to wonder if they ever existed.
Finally, when you are old and frail, you will collapse in exhaustion.
Oh, sweetheart.
Why are you crying?
Because I have searched for my family all my life...
to the end of my life,
and I'm still alone.
[angel] You should not be crying for your misfortunes, for your own sins.
You also have been searched for,
but you're so lost in your own selfishness
that no one could ever find you.
Confess.
Before your peers.
But what did I do?
[angel] You know.
Confess.
I've been a coward my whole life.
You will confess everything.
After which you will find the earth replaced by good water.
Sleep will come untroubled.
To the sound of distant trumpets, you will awake,
as if by a miracle...
at the foot of your glittering village.
No one will recognize you,
but the smell of the air and the sounds of the insects
and the way the evening light slashes itself across the chimney
of a neighbor's old house
will unloose in you a torrent of vivid memories.
You will be invited to a special play being put on in an outdoor theater
just for that night.
Despite your hunger,
you will decide to spend your last dollar on this.
Over the last 40 years, his memory had faltered to the extent
that he couldn't remember his own mother's face,
but just by breathing in the air,
he was seized by the absolute certainty that this was his village.
Nobody remembered him.
And even though all of his neighbors had been replaced by younger generations,
he recognized everything, and somehow he too felt recognized.
His home had waited for him just as loyally as he had searched for it.
Even the sight of the evening sun
casting slashes of amber light across a familiar chimney
sent him reeling into a flood of memories.
-What did our father do next? -Where was the village?
We only saw it as boys and have no memories.
-Please, tell us where to find it. -No, wait. What did he do next?
He was delirious with hunger and only had enough money
for one bowl of soup, but before he could spend it,
he was invited to a special play.
It was already in progress, but he felt compelled to go in,
and so he spent his last dollar.
Not long after sitting in, he saw that the details of the plot
were impossibly similar to those of his own life.
And there were three young men on the stage
who looked remarkably like himself.
This is me!
And he rose up, at once exhilarated and terrified that it might not be true,
-and he announced... -This is my story!
And the three young men immediately recognized the man as their father.
-Dad? -No. It can't be.
[Beau] My sons.
[boy 1] Dad?
Dad. Dad...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
-[boy 2] Oh, my God. -You're my boys.
Oh, my beautiful, sweet boys. Don't be afraid. Come here. Come here.
Come here. Oh, my-- Oh, my God. Oh!
Where have you been?
You were ripped from me.
I've looked for you for so long.
[sobbing] So long...
-[boy 1] Where did you go? -I know you.
I made you. Oh, my loves.
-Oh, my loves. Oh, my darlings. -[boys sobbing]
-Oh, my darlings. -[boy 2] I missed you so much.
That's okay. It's okay.
I'm here. I'm here.
Oh, my loves.
It's okay.
What about our mother? Is she...?
-What? -Is she...?
She's not with you?
She's not with you?
-Oh, God. -[boy 3] We were raised as orphans.
Oh, no.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
-[boy 1] Where's Mom? -[Beau] It's okay, my love. It's okay.
[boy 1] Mom...
[boy 2] Is there...?
Is there any other family?
Besides us?
You had a grandmother.
[boy 2] Where is she?
Her head...
And our grandfather?
[boy 2] How did he die?
[Mona] He died on our wedding night.
The same night you were conceived.
He died the very instant you were conceived.
How?
By finishing.
Into me.
He had a heart murmur, just like you.
Did it hurt?
I'm sure it was excruciating.
It was the first time we made love.
The first time either of us made love, with anyone.
Your grandpa and your great-grandpa died the same way.
But he thought he might be different.
I'm just as guilty.
I urged him on.
I wanted a normal life.
I wanted a child.
He died on top of me.
Inside.
I think about it, and I wanna rip my ears off.
But then...
But then, that same trauma...
which changed me so utterly...
also resulted in the greatest gift of my life.
I am so sorry for what your daddy passed down to you.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
[boy 1] Is that a lie?
No.
[boy 2] Can that really happen?
Yes.
It's why I never...
with anyone.
[boy 1] Dad...
you've never been with anyone?
[boy 2] Then...? Then how did you have us?
What should I do? Which limb shall I strike off?
You might act yesterday, and it would be decades tardy.
[Hero] Have I not given all I have?
-All you have? -You have given trifles.
[God] You have sacrificed nothing real.
[Hero] I have been pinned down by my promises.
I am not the master of my life.
Are you okay?
-[Hero] I am a mouse in a maze! -[God] A maze.
I feel sick.
I know.
Try this.
It helps me.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
Hello.
Can I help you?
Do you recognize me?
I don't know.
When you were little...
[Beau] What?
How did you come here?
I was chased.
Your father is alive.
What?
I knew him. After you were born.
I worked for your mom...
Not before I was born. He died before--
...serving your dad food, cleaning up after him.
My parents were in debt to your mom.
What's that?
What?
-Who are you? -It doesn't matter, I...
-It does. It does. -No. It's just... Kidding. I...
I'm so happy to see you.
Are you him?
Wait.
Wait.
[pregnant woman] You okay, sweetheart?
[Hero] Do my eyes deceive me?
What is this phantom I see?
Hello, fair stranger!
Ah, now you see, out of the shadows--
[man 1] Everybody hide now! Get me down from here!
-Somebody help me! -[man 2] Somebody!
-[woman] Oh, my God! -[man 3] Somebody help me!
[man 1] Get me down from here! Get me down! I can't, I'm tied up. Hurry!
Get me down! Help!
[Strange Man] Beau!
-Dad? -Run! Now--
[Elaine] Am I hurting you?
Okay, let's go. Clothes off.
[Mona] Come on. Enough, now.
What did I say?
Didn't I say I wasn't gonna do this again with you tonight?
I'm about to feel hurt. You're about to really hurt me.
Where's Daddy?
Excuse me?
You know where Daddy is.
Daddy's dead.
Are you trying to hurt me?
I don't care! I want Daddy!
Do you want Daddy too?
Come on. You want it your way, let's go!
Up you go.
-I can't. -Oh, but of course you can.
You're big enough to hurt Mommy, you're big enough for this.
-Nobody's allowed up there. -Up!
-Do you wanna go up too? -[Young Beau] No.
What is that? Are you nodding?
This is it.
We don't talk about you anymore!
Get back in!
[Beau] Excuse me, sir. Is the funeral already happening?
Already over. There's a video inside.
[man on recording] Mona.
Mona Wassermann.
We're gathered here today as a community, bound together by our love for Mona
and by a feeling of duty.
The duty to mourn Mona's passing, but also to celebrate Mona's life.
Mona, who was petrified of squirrels.
Mona, who single-handedly built a super-business
beyond her wildest dreams.
Mona, who was an endlessly dedicated wife to her adoring husband,
who passed away tragically just as their life together was blossoming.
And Mona, who was a devoted mother to her sole surviving son, Beau,
whom she loved so deeply
and who has elected not to be present with us today.
Mona loved Beau with a love that could move mountains.
In fact, I suggest when we leave,
we check on the mountains to make sure they're okay.
[woman on recording] What can you say?
I hope she knows that.
I wish I could tell her that.
That I did, I loved her.
[man] And it's in accordance with her last wishes
that we now play this song.
Her favorite song.

It's me.
It's Beau.
Oh, my God.
Beau?
No.
Uh, it can't be.
I can't believe it's you.
Oh, my God.
I mean, of course it's you. This is your mom.
I'm so sorry.
For your loss.
What are you doing here?
I'm just trying to, you know, uh, pay my respects, and...
I guess, give you my condolences, since you're actually here.
I'm...
so sorry.
I can't believe it's you.
I can't believe it's you.
Do I look different?
You recognized me. I'm old now.
You're the same.
No, I'm not.
You are.
Well, you're the same too.
Except for your body and your face.
You worked for her?
What do you mean?
I did, until last week.
I was actually just drowning my sorrows before I came.
My breath's like pure wine.
"Until last week"?
I'm sorry for your loss.
I waited for you.
What do you mean?
Why?
You told me to.
I even have it in writing.
I wanted you to.
Baby.
Baby, baby...
Do you want to go inside?
Do you want me to leave?
Let's go inside.
Bedroom. Where?
The dragon's lair.
Got any candles in here?
Why don't you go to the bathroom? When you come back, I'll be ready.
-You didn't get undressed. -Yep.
Hi. Sorry. Hi.
-You okay? -Yeah.
Are you?
-You're so tense. -Oh.
-Oh, I'm sorry. -Relax.
Okay. It's just because, you know, it's been-- Well, kind of a while.
Yeah, me too.
I like that you're not all macho.
Thank you.
Take these off.
Okay, what I meant was that it's been really kind of a while.
-Well, it hasn't affected your virility. -What?
-You're crazy hard. -Really?
Oh, my God.
-Is it...? Is it on? -Yeah.
You sure the condom's on all the way?
Yeah? Oh, my God.
-Am I really in? -You feel so good.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Isn't it nice?
Yeah. But wait...
-I... What? -Let's start it over.
-Isn't it nice? -Yeah.
You-- Wait a second.
I can't...
I think it's gonna happen.
Wait! You gotta wait a second.
Stop.
Oh! Stop. Stop. Stop.
Oh, no! [yelling]
Oh, my-- My God.
God.
I really felt that.
-I... -Oh, God that was a lot.
You just blasted through that bag.
-Oh, my God. -I love you.
I wanna come too.
-I... -Hold on.
Hold on.
On.
Getting it. Don't move.
Yeah. Don't move.
Don't move. Okay? [moaning]
Oh, my God. [laughs]
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my God. ♪ I ain't gonna cry, no... ♪
I really thought I was gonna die.
My whole life.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
[Mona] No, please. Continue as if I wasn't here.
What would be next?
No?
You don't look especially overjoyed to see me, honey.
I was dead just a minute ago. This is a miracle.
Get rid of this. Feed Harry.
She worked for you?
I sincerely doubt that, sweetheart,
but if you're right, you can let her know she's fired.
For how long?
How many years from the beginning?
-From...? -How is your head feeling?
It looks like you really banged up your face.
You could have a concussion.
You don't feel disoriented?
You know where you are?
I'm in my house.
Actually, you're in my house, sweetheart.
And my house is your house, which it always will be.
But if you know where you are,
then you must also know where you just were
and where you just did what you just did, which I saw every second of.
You didn't just wake up suddenly and you were there.
You didn't just get dropped in, out of the blue, to your surprise.
Your deceased mother's room.
Only days after what you believed was her death.
I didn't.
-You didn't get deposited by accident. -I didn't mean it.
-I know you didn't. -No, I knew you weren't dead.
I saw with my own eyes exactly what you knew
and what you didn't know.
You saw my body.
I saw the birthmark, Mom.
I know those were Martha's hands.
That's right.
-Good night, baby. -Good night, Martha.
And if I hear any noise,
I'll break back in and tickle you to death!
It's...
What...? How...?
How do you even...?
How can you do that to her?
"Do that to her"?
Baby, I would never do anything to the loyal and devoted housekeeper
who gave me 37 years of unconditional service.
She volunteered.
-No, she didn't. -Yes.
-No, she didn't. -She did.
No, she didn't.
I couldn't restrain her from volunteering.
For how much?
[Mona] Enough that every member of her extended family...
quit their job on the same day...
and won't ever need to work again.
And you know something else?
It was worth every penny.
Because now I know.
-What do you know? -Everything.
You don't know anything.
Oh, do you think so, Beau?
Do you really think so?
Do you also think I didn't know when you called
to give me the big, bad news
about your fictitious keys being stolen from your imaginary door?
-My key-- They were stolen. -You think a mother can even help
but see through her son's blatant lies and falsehoods and endless schemes?
You think this is any different
from the time you gave me the exact same CD for my birthday
that you gave me the year before,
and which you also gave your fucking high school counselor?
Or when you bought me that kitchen set
the very week after I publicly swore off cooking?
Even when you were a baby,
you rejected me and refused to breastfeed,
while every other smug cunt on the street
had happy, docile babies sucking their tits dry.
You think I hear the absurd story of you missing your flight
and that I don't absolutely know,
that I have any hint of a doubt,
that you never, from the very start, intended to make that flight?!
The true surprise, the shock, would have been you actually coming!
Now, that would have spun my head like a top.
I wouldn't have known what to do.
I'd have thrown myself, flopping on the floor,
begging God's forgiveness for ever having doubted you,
but still, I would have been struck stupid with disbelief!
What, you walking away?
Where you going?
What's behind the door, Beau?
Where on earth are you gonna go?
You've always acted like some dutiful, doting little boy,
as if it's throwing me off some scent.
None of it's ever been real.
You spent your whole life going around,
asking every half-wit you could find:
"If I do this, can I avoid this, or will that happen?"
As if you were born without the mechanism to choose.
You let it all resolve itself in the absence of you.
You make everyone do it for you.
You think that makes you innocent?
My own mother wouldn't even touch me.
Not if it was simply to stamp me out if I was on fire.
I wasn't worthy of her love.
I hadn't earned it. And I never earned it.
No matter what I did.
No matter how much of my deepest, real self
I denied and buried and smothered until it was dead.
None of it mattered.
She blamed me for everything her mother did to her.
When I had you, I promised, "I will never do that to him.
I will give him all the love I have."
You know what I tell people when they ask me how my son is doing?
I say, "Your guess is as good as mine."
How I wish that were true.
[Friel on recording] Tell me more about that period.
[Beau] Well...
when I was just starting to like my own stuff
and do my own things,
she'd take all those changes very personally
and get very mad or sad,
and make me feel bad about it until I stopped.
[Friel] So, through the weaning process,
she took your displays of autonomy as a betrayal.
[Beau] Exactly.
What do you mean?
[Friel] Can you give me an example?
[Beau] Well, like, she would give me lots of love...
Oh, I gave you lots of love. I'm sorry.
...but if I didn't give it back to her in the exact same way,
she saw it as me being not thankful and, like, trying to hurt her.
[Friel] So, the love was conditional?
[Beau] Yes.
[Friel] This is very good for you, Beau.
Over 300 sessions, and that was about as flattering to me as they get.
Which one was my favorite, Jeremy?
October 3, 2018.
[Beau] How could you...?
How could you...?
How could you do this to me?
[Beau on recording] I've been having it since I was little,
where I'm a little boy,
probably the same age as when I started having the dream,
and there's another me, who's identical...
but he's braver,
and he asks her about my father because I'm too scared.
And then...
she sends him away and locks him up.
Upstairs.
And she never talks about him again.
[Friel] What is it you want to know about your father?
If you weren't afraid, if there were no consequences...
-I want to know the truth. -...what would you ask your mom?
[Beau] I'd ask her...
-To tell me the truth. -I don't know.
[Friel] Do you feel she didn't tell you the truth?
-Yes. -[Beau] I...
-I don't know. -Yes.
-I know now. -But I think I'm too afraid to believe it.
I know the truth. I...
I met my father.
I met the man in the woods, and I know.
Why did you lie to me?
Do you want the truth now?
Yes!
[Mona] Follow me.
-Up there? -That's right.
Nobody's allowed up there.
Some things are for your protection, Beau,
and I want you to remember that I kept this from you.
-I don't wanna go up there now. -No.
You want the truth, and I think you deserve it.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
-I'll be right behind you. -I don't want-- Mom.
I'll be right behind you. Don't worry.
Up you go.
Don't worry, I'll be right behind you.
Don't worry, sweetheart. Up you go.
-This is just like my dream. -I'm right behind you.
I'm right behind you.
Oh, God.
Oh, this is exactly like my dream.
[Mona] Don't you get it, you stupid idiot? That wasn't a dream.
-That was a memory. -Wait, wait, wait!
Mommy, wait!
No. No. Come on.
-Come on. -[metallic clang]
[man] Beau?
Beau?
My beautiful, sweet boy.
Oh, boy, let me see.
[Mona] Oh, Beau. Oh, baby.
Baby, sweetheart.
Oh, sweetheart.
I didn't want you to know.
Do you see now why I lied?
Beau.
Beau!
That was your father.
Oh, no!
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know I've been a bad son.
I'll be a good son. Please. I'm sorry.
I'll do anything to make it up to you.
I'll make it up to you. Please, please, please.
-Please. I'm sorry. -You selfish little boy!
What are you crying about?
Do you have any idea what I had to go through
to bring you into this world?
Stand up.
You cry now?
You need a mother now?
Ever since you clawed your way out of me,
I've had to dig down deep to my very bottom
and squeeze the love out of myself, but still I gave it to you.
I've given you my whole fucking life.
Which you took, and you took,
and you took, and I squeezed myself empty.
I gave you everything.
And what do I get back? What do I have?
Insults. And empty promises.
You promised to never hurt me. Do you even remember that one?
You promised it a hundred fucking times.
You swore on your own life.
But your promises are nothing but shit.
I've been ground down to nothing by love and panic and worry.
Is my baby hungry? Is he healthy?
Is he scared enough of the world?
And the fruit of all this anguish is grief.
And hatred.
Yes. Yes. Hatred.
I do. I do.
I hate--
Mommy?
Are you okay? You...
You can breathe. Can you breathe? Can you breathe?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Are you okay? Are you okay?
[man] Beau Isaac Wassermann.
Born May 10th, 1975.
Proceed.
We are gathered now
to assess the extent...
of the subject's guilt.
To begin with, a seemingly innocuous tradition.
Every Monday, before his weekly appointment
to scapegoat his mother,
the subject would visit his local pond to feed the ducks.
Just as he never missed an opportunity to feed his therapist's fish.
Very nice.
Very nice.
But what happens...
when he meets a human beggar that very night?
Now, one can see...
that the subject will go out of his way to feed a bird or a fish,
but not to support a suffering member of his own species.
[defense] Objection! Violent street crimes were everywhere on the news
and everyone was advised to avoid strangers!
This is nothing new!
The subject had thoughts every day
around relieving the suffering of those less fortunate.
By all indications, he has a healthy, functioning conscience.
He just chose to ignore it.
Consider the following episode.
Day 49 of his 9th year.
He goes shopping with his mother.
At one point, she lost him.
Or so she thought.
Fearing the worst, she panics.
She searches the building.
She cries out for the boy, who was, in fact,
hiding behind a corner,
watching the whole thing.
[defense] My client was genuinely lost.
It was upon finding his mother, seeing her frantic state,
that he hesitated, for fear of punishment.
[Cohen] It was in this frantic state of mind that his mother tripped and fell,
tearing ligaments in her knee and badly harming her ankle.
And still...
the subject did not intervene.
[defense] He was afraid!
[Cohen] Consider now the subject at age 15, day 210,
finding himself in the rare company of other boys.
The subject,
hoping to impress his horrendous new friends,
invites them into his home
while his mother is out buying him gifts for his birthday.
He lets them into her private bathroom,
and allows them to rifle through her dirty laundry,
and inspect, and ultimately steal, her undergarments.
[Beau] Oh, God.
Oh, God. They pressured me.
-They pressured me! -[defense] They pressured him!
What are you doing?
No! No!
No!
Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Even his supposed acts of thoughtfulness are emblematic of a greater hypocrisy.
Take this very week.
The subject asked Grace and Roger to drive him home,
so that he might bury his mother and commence proper mourning.
Roger offered the option...
of driving home tonight
if the offer of driving tomorrow wasn't soon enough.
And Beau chose to drive home tomorrow,
further postponing a trip
that had already been outrageously delayed.
And if one examines the expression on his face
when Roger made this challenge...
one can only conclude
that the subject was panicked at the idea of returning home.
I didn't wanna put him out.
I-- He had surgeries.
I cried when I was beside the coffin.
When I was told the news,
I cried for hours!
Continuing to bear this in mind,
I ask you to consider yesterday.
Not three hours after meeting a knocked-up dimwit
who made clumsy eyes at him,
did he gift her with a tributary gift
intended for no one less than his recently deceased mother.
Now, when the pregnant slut offered to return this special gift,
did he insist that this total stranger keep--?
No. No. Wait!
Wait! Mom!
Wait.
My legs! My legs are stuck.
What? Wait.
Wait, Mom. My legs. I can't move.
What?
Mommy, please.
Please help me! Please!
Please help me out! Please!
Please!
Please don't fault me!
Help! Help me!
Somebody help me, please!
Help!
Help!
Help me, please!
Help! Please!
Please. I don't want to-- I don't want to...
[Mona sobbing] My baby! No!
My baby. No.
My baby.
No.
That's a long time.
Especially when you're alone.
But you don't have to be.
I'll stand by my decision.
I can do this alone.
By myself…
I'm doing the right thing.
I did everything I could.
But it's not there anymore.
How can I bring you back to life when you're not there anymore?
This is where it ends.
Why are you looking at me like that?
I can't help it, my wife's so beautiful.
Wife? As if we've been married that long.
That's a long time.
It's not. That's only 41 and a half hours.
What's with all the math? Are you trying to impress me?
What for? There's no need for that, you're already mine.
Like forever and ever?
I have an idea.
There he goes writing his little songs again.
TILL THE END OF…
Need help?
Not for now. I'll let you know when I do.
Hey!
Miss, miss, can I get a kiss, kiss?
Shut that off. Sounds like a stupid ringtone.
You're mean.
I'm not a pervert
What's wrong with you? It's our song.
Why? Will you defend me from bashers?
Will you even allow it if I write songs like that?
I won't defend you but I won't hold it against you.
Right?
Give me a kiss, kiss!
You're not helping.
I can't even finish this song.
I can't get the words out.
I told Will I'll have it ready when we get home.
Hey, you'd better not be writing that song while we're having sex.
What's the matter with you?
What do you mean?
Why is it
you're still cute even when you're annoying?
She liked that.
-So what? -You liked that.
No, come on--
Don't post that. I hate it when you keep doing that.
It's done. It's posted.
#YOURSFOREVER, I LOVE YOU ISABELLA MRS. CRUZ, #PERFECTWIFE, THIS IS IT!
The engine might get too cold.
We won't have a ride home if it doesn't start.
Don't be so mean to my Scarlet. You'll upset her.
I've known her far longer than you.
Is that so?
Then you should have married Scarlet instead.
Why did you pick me?
-Is that what you want? -Don't be jealous.
-Yeah, take her to the boat with you. -Why is your bag so heavy?
Wait for me.
-Help me with the video, please. -For what?
I just need to promote Travel City luggage. Please?
And we're here in Camarines Sur.
And of course, I'm with my--
-Hi! -It's our honeymoon.
And on our honeymoon, we can't possibly be without Travel City luggage.
It's super light. It takes no effort to carry.
And I'm sure you can throw anything in there,
and all your stuff would be safe.
Fuck--
Hello, what?
Hey, fuckhead. I'm calling about your song.
Just 'cause you're on your honeymoon, doesn't mean I'll let you off the hook.
Is that all? Okay, okay.
Not so fast, shithead.
The studio's already booked for when you get back.
What if I want to extend?
Extend? Are you fucking crazy? You asshole.
Hi, Will.
-Hey, Billie! -Hi, Will.
What do you need from my husband?
How's the honeymoon?
It was going well until you called.
I was just checking in on you guys.
Didn't I tell you not to call if it's not an emergency?
Is there an emergency?
Nothing at all. Just work stuff. Enjoy your honeymoon.
-What does he want? -Just following up on the song.
Wait.
I'll just go on live for Travel City.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm camera-shy.
And we're here at Panglao Island!
With me, ladies and gentlemen, the one and only, Mrs. Jose Emilio Cruz!
-How many times will you kiss me? -Don't be shy, let them see you.
Okay. Hi! Hi!
And on our honeymoon, we can't possibly be without Travel City bags.
It keeps all your stuff safe and secure, my friends.
Thanks to Travel City, our honeymoon will be stress-free.
Hello.
He's our guide.
Aren't you…
Aren't you a singer?
Please call me Jecs.
I'm Jecs. This is my wife.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
I'm Francis. I'm the caretaker of Panglao Island.
The boat's here. We can go.
Quick favor, can you lift the sign a bit higher?
Sure, sir.
See that, guys? Feels good, doesn't it?
Right? Right, love?
Sure, love. Let's just go.
-Let's go. -Let's go.
Let me carry your luggage.
Hi, guys! Yes, Panglao Island is gorgeous.
Just like my wife.
-Is it live? Hi! -Damn.
Okay, guys. Shoutout to Will, my manager.
Take care of yourself there, buddy.
I'm losing my signal so if you guys want to watch my livestream,
and you want to know when, click the notification bell.
Follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and of course, on YouTube.
Thank you very much!
Sir! There it is.
There it is!
There it is. It's beautiful.
I'm sure you'll like it, miss!
-How many followers do I have? -Let me see.
You'll gain more, don't worry.
You mentioned all the platforms. Did you forget anything?
-Are there other platforms? -That's all of it.
Great, now can you focus on me? It's our honeymoon.
Sure thing.
"Sure thing"? Is it that hard?
Welcome to Panglao Island.
-Oh, my god, it's so pretty. -Solid.
You're lucky. There are no other visitors on the island.
-Really? -Yeah!
You have it all to yourselves.
-What? -We'll have some alone time.
There it is, Panglao Island.
-Panglao Island. -Panglao Island.
-Welcome! -Travel City Luggage sure is worth it.
There you go again. Just take a picture before we leave, okay?
Okay, we're going up on these…
steps.
I think there are 300 steps.
Francis, you sure you don't need help?
This is nothing, ma'am.
You sure?
It's hot today!
Yes, ma'am.
But no worries.
Wow…
We'll get there soon enough.
You have the island all to yourselves.
What do you say? He says we're alone here.
We're pretty lucky.
Great timing. Nice.
We're here.
Welcome to Panglao Island.
Check it out.
Still moving toward the Philippine Area of Responsibility
the low pressure area monitored by--
I'll leave my shoes outside.
Why are you watching on this TV?
I just wanted to watch the news.
-The news. -Hello. My name is Billie.
Billie! Good morning. Welcome to Panglao Island.
-It's so pretty. -Thank you.
This is Gina, my wife. We're the caretakers of Panglao Island.
Welcome to Panglao Island.
It's so pretty.
That's a beautiful plant.
I bought it on the way. I heard it's easy to take care of.
Yes, that's true. It really is easy to take care of it.
That plant is just like me.
Sorry?
Yes! I'm just like that plant.
You see, I survive just fine without being watered.
-What are you talking about? -Love, get in here.
Nice.
Please have some refreshments.
Sir, this is my wife, Gina.
Hello.
Hello, sir.
Aren't you that singer?
Yes.
I know you. You're the singer of--
What if tomorrow won't be the same?
Sir, let's take a picture! Hey. Take a picture of us.
-I'm busy. -Hurry up!
-Sir, is it okay? -Yeah, I'm coming. Hang on.
-Gina, it's okay. -No. I'm all sweaty.
That's okay. Look here.
There we go.
-Thank you, ma'am. -One, two, three!
-Okay, here. -Take it with our phone.
Here.
There. One more time.
We got it.
Sir, sorry about that.
My wife's your number one fan.
When we sing on the karaoke, she always sings your song.
"What If?"
You know, I always get 100 points when I sing that song.
I swear! Sir, do you have other songs?
So I can sing them back to back next time on the karaoke.
There's one called "Heartbeat."
Was that a hit?
By the way, tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.,
we're gonna go island hopping.
-I love that. -Nice. Let's do it.
-I'm so down for that. -Island hopping.
Ma'am, sir, we live right over there. You can see our house from here.
So, if you ever need anything, you can come right over.
If you need help with cooking,
since there's plenty of fresh fish caught around here.
Just call me. I can do that for you, okay?
Okay, that's enough. They probably want to rest now.
-I know that! -Okay, let's go.
Thank you so much. Enjoy your stay, ma'am, sir!
So…
-So? It's worth it, right? -Worth it.
That's something.
-Yeah, exactly. -Yeah.
Yeah.
Ella keeps liking your posts.
-Where? -Right there.
Ella. Ella.
-Ella. -Yeah. That's nothing.
She's trying to get your attention. She's raining likes on you.
She just likes doing that.
Sure, but she didn't like our wedding photo.
No… It's just…
What?
She's just nice to me because I went to her show.
What's with that reaction?
She's into you.
So?
She's not my type.
You tried to get with her before.
She's not my type.
What if she gets naked in front of you?
I'll close my eyes.
Wow.
Yeah.
But if you get naked--
-Hold that thought. -What now?
It's mama.
Hello, Ma?
I can't watch YouTube.
I think my phone is broken.
Broken?
No, it's the… You know this, the one with the password.
It's 0-6-2-1, Ma. Your birthday.
That's it. I knew it.
By the way, Jecs, we need to pay the electricity bill.
I already gave it to Dianne, Ma.
Did you?
For my maintenance meds, too?
Yeah, and for your groceries, too, Ma.
Didn't she tell you?
We barely see each other. She goes straight to bed after work.
I wouldn't want to wake her up, you know.
Her shift starts past midnight, poor girl.
I'm just glad you picked up even while you're there.
Okay. If there's nothing else, Ma, I should go. Bye.
Hey, wait.
What now?
Don't come back here without my grandchild, okay?
Okay, sure, Ma. I got it.
All right, bye.
-Give me your phone. -Why?
I'll show you something.
You know what,
if you get naked in front of me…
I'm not like that!
-What's wrong? -It wasn't like that!
It's my honeymoon. Yeah, how are you?
I don't give a shit about Billie, to be honest.
Yeah, who cares if she's butt naked.
I hate you so much.
You excited?
Are you asking me?
-What are we supposed to do on an island? -Don't start with me.
Sir! Coffee!
Yes, thank you!
Hi! Thanks for the offer.
Wait. Who's this?
It's Hannah. Hold on.
Okay, I'll be here.
How's the trip?
Good.
We're going island hopping.
Gosh, I'm so jealous.
Good job.
Oh, right. Your dad called.
He said he's been trying to reach you since last night. You're not picking up.
He didn't even make the effort to go to my wedding. Who does that?
I know. I get it. I get it. Because…
You're still angry. What do I say when he calls again?
Nothing. Tell him it's too late and…
I'm supposed to be on my honeymoon.
Honestly, I don't blame you. Uncle's always been like that.
It's just sad 'cause your mom couldn't fly home from Canada
for your wedding and now you have this quarrel with your dad.
Right? Hang on. You…
Wait, hello? I'll call you back, okay?
I still need to cook. I've got tons to do. It's such a mess…
I gotta go. Call you later. Bye.
Bye.
Daddy's now pestering Hannah.
Why don't you just call or text him?
Why would I? I won't talk to him till he apologizes.
What's this on your face?
Okay.
-Can we try to be happy on our honeymoon? -Okay.
-Is it cooked? -Almost, sir.
-Really? -Yes, sir. It won't be long now.
Ma'am, need more firewood?
This should be enough, Francis.
It's just right.
All right.
Look at you.
-Deluxe service. -Why, of course!
What do you need me to do?
-Everything! -Oh, no!
You're so pretty, ma'am!
Looking good, ma'am!
Right? Like sour soup.
I'm a lucky guy!
I'll snap a photo.
For real?
-Wow! -Wait!
What about me, did I get lucky with you?
Well, of course, damn you.
I got it.
Post it now.
I'll do it later. I'm busy.
-Just fucking do it now. Post it. -Fine, fine.
Did Caloy tell you?
He won't make it to your recording tomorrow.
-It's his child's christening. -Then find a replacement.
Fuck Caloy.
He knows we're on a tight schedule for your album release.
-I'm neck deep in problems. -Excuse me. I need to do something.
Hey! Billie.
-Hey. -How's it going?
Will. What's up?
Right on time. You're heaven sent.
What's up?
We're doing a session tomorrow.
I need a keyboardist. I was hoping you'd do it.
For whom?
For him. Jecs.
My new artist, the one you're hearing. It's his debut album, so…
And this dude deserves an album?
Not bad.
-Why? -Oh, shit.
Jecs…
Congrats. I heard "What Is?" got tons of airplay.
"What If?"
What… "What If?" Yes.
Jecs, this is Billie.
Hey, she's good.
What else can you expect from Enrico Neri's daughter?
That's why you've got high standards.
Don't be a jerk.
So, Billie. Are you good for tomorrow?
If you aren't busy, it's good money. A gig is a gig.
-Yeah, I'm not busy tomorrow. Sure. -All right!
It seems you don't want to do it. I don't think you like my songs.
Don't be silly.
No!
I can lower my standards for you.
-See you tomorrow. -All right.
-Text me. Thank you. -I'll text.
Yeah, take care.
She's great.
You asshole, she's out of your league.
I told you, she's Enrico Neri's daughter.
You said I should find another Since there are others out there
In my mind There's nothing else to look for
Even when you're not with me I smile at the thought of you
When you're in front of me The world stops revolving
I wish…
Will.
Take five, please.
Okay, guys. Take five.
-Let's smoke outside? -Did you like it?
It's okay.
Just "okay"?
Want my honest opinion?
Do I have a choice?
It's okay,
but from what I can hear, I feel like,
the general feel of the song is…
This is just based on what I'm hearing.
It sounds like "What If?"
Yeah. It's okay, but it's like, you just recycled your stuff.
Sorry. You said you wanted honesty.
It's fine, though. In general.
I did want to hear the truth but I didn't expect that…
it would hurt.
Will.
Can we reschedule the recording?
What the fuck. Why?
-I just need to fix something. -Excuse me.
Billie, is there a problem?
The world stops when I see you
If only you could feel
The way my heart beats
When I'm with you
Should I keep these feelings hidden?
It's beautiful. It really is.
Why don't we write a song and do a duet?
Me?
I'm not a singer.
No, really.
Besides…
Besides what?
Never mind, you'll think it's cheesy.
I'll lower my standards for you.
I don't know, maybe I'm just not into it.
Singing, for me… it's very personal.
Even if it's just a gig, I don't think I can do it.
So if I ever do it one day, it has to be with someone…
it has to be for something meaningful.
See, I told you it's cheesy.
Okay, fine.
Okay, I criticize a lot so I'm scared of also getting criticized.
So, never mind.
Why aren't you saying anything?
You're so…
You said I should find another Since there are others out there
In my mind There's nothing else to look for
Even when you're not with me I smile at the thought of you
When you're in front of me The world stops revolving
I wish you knew
How my heart beats differently
Whenever I'm with you
Should I hide how hard I'm falling?
The way you carry me Makes me forget my heaviness
You are the breath of my heart
I just want to kiss you
I wish you'd know, my love
I wish you knew
How my heart beats differently
Whenever I'm with you
Should I hide how hard I'm falling?
Where are you looking?
Damn it, we have another hit!
-It's so good. -Nice!
-Nice, dude. -That was sick, Billie.
-Love your style, Billie. -That wasn't me. It was all you guys.
Where'd you get that…
It's all from your song.
-Really? -For real.
You're really something, Billie.
Sir.
Sir.
-Thank you. -You're welcome, sir.
Thanks a lot.
Sir.
That's a cool phone.
-Do you play Mobile Legends? -No, I'm not a gamer.
That's a shame.
You have a cool phone and you don't use it.
Hey. What, you're envious?
Hey!
That's because he does nothing but be on his phone, sir.
He takes it with him even in bed.
Cut it out, Gina. You're jealous of a cell phone.
I'm not jealous, asshole.
I'm right, you're always playing those video games.
You know, he's worse than his son. He's addicted to that game, LM!
-What's "LM"? -LM!
-If you're gonna scold me, know the facts. -LM!
It's ML. It's the only vice that I have.
Would you rather I drank or played video games?
I want you to pull yourself together. You spend all your money on mobile data.
I'm not buying it, I'm connecting to free WiFi.
I swear, Gina. You guys are so cute.
This is how we show our love.
How's that going?
-It's done. Try it. -Sir, can I bum a cig?
Sure thing.
-Francis! -A light, too.
-No, it's okay. -Have some shame!
It's okay. It's no problem.
Goodness!
It's a guy thing. They'll do what they want.
You should be ashamed.
But ma'am, you're so lucky.
Why do you say that?
Because you're able to experience this.
Going on a honeymoon.
What about you, Gina? Where did you go for your honeymoon?
Nowhere!
I never experienced a honeymoon.
I was pregnant when I got married.
Francis is a sharp shooter.
You know what happened? One pop, straight to my baby oven.
I got snagged!
Francis!
What, aren't you gonna help me?
Yeah, coming. Jeez. I was about to play.
Let's prepare the table.
-Ma'am! -Yes?
You're a singer! You have a great voice. Let's take a picture!
-I want a picture with you. -No.
I'm not a singer.
I love your voice.
-Sir, she's a singer. She's denying it. -No. Tell her.
She really is a singer.
But she doesn't want to be. So, wifey? How about that duet?
Come on! Do it! Do a duet!
-I'll cheer for you! -Please!
Please!
-Let's just dance? -Francis, dance!
I'll be your groove
I'll pass, sir!
This fool.
I'll prepare the table. Let's eat!
Wait.
You're with me tonight
Come here by my side
Is that good?
-Really? -Yep.
Still working?
Yeah, gotta seize the moment. I thought of something.
I thought we were gonna…
Wait, really? Right here?
Forget it.
You're busy, right?
You've got to seize the moment. Write your song…
So seize your moment.
Why did I even say it?
Now I'm left hanging bone-hard
Your fault for working on our honeymoon
What do you want?
Miss, miss, can I get a kiss, kiss?
I can't take it anymore
I'm not a pervert
I'll record this. Wait.
This is the extent of our honeymoon.
This is as intimate as we're ever gonna get.
Miss, miss
Can I get a kiss, kiss?
I can't take it anymore
I'm not a pervert!
Miss, miss
Can I get a kiss, kiss?
I can't take it anymore…
Good luck, bro.
-Boys, are you ready? -Anytime!
Let's go!
Is there a problem?
Depends on you.
What did I do?
Hey!
Are you sure?
You sure?
Isabella Neri…
Say yes! Say yes!
As long as you're sure.
Isabel…
You're sure?
-Okay. -Say yes!
There it goes.
Play it.
Here, here.
Take a video.
Billie, I know it's cliché, I know it's cheesy.
But now, I can boldly say,
And I promise you,
starting now, you'll never be alone.
Doesn't matter how hard things get, I'm here for you.
I know we're just setting out on this journey,
We'll discover so many things about each other.
And like what you said, all snot-faced,
LOVE, DON'T LET ME GO EVEN THOUGH I'M A JERK SOMETIMES - #YOURSFOREVER
Okay, go.
WIFEY AND OUR SMALL FAMILY
Me, too.
I like this.
Just us, chilling.
There's no content to think about,
not thinking about my next song…
Why don't you show these songs to Will?
They're simple, but there's space for improvement.
It's not Will's style.
He's got his own vibe, I've got mine.
Can't you fight for the things you really want?
I could but then I'll lose my contract.
Then what, I'll go back to selling insurance?
You could.
But if you stop
making songs,
the whole universe would be sad.
The whole universe?
And your number one fan.
If I stop, what happens to us?
I won't have anything to pay for our townhouse.
A lot of years left on the mortgage.
if we're out of options,
we could move into one of the apartments your family's renting out, right?
Not really.
I don't think so.
Where will I source out my monthly support for mama?
I'm glad she put all my savings there.
At least, I have another source of income.
That's true.
Before you used to get so many gigs.
And you'd be abroad for so long. I didn't see much of you.
Did you miss me?
So much! I don't have anyone else to annoy!
There really isn't.
It's coming down hard.
Love, careful.
Ma'am, we'll do that.
Okay!
-Okay! -We'll take care of it.
Oh, gosh.
Well, good morning, love.
It's all wet.
It must be the incoming typhoon.
Is there a typhoon?
Don't worry, it's just a rain shower, ma'am.
Don't go scaring them with a typhoon.
No, I watched it on the weather news on TV.
Did it get wet, love?
-You okay? -It's wet.
-Is it my fault? -It's your lips' fault.
-Love, let me wash those for you. -Yes?
In your dreams. Hang these up.
Thanks.
It's pouring out there! The street's flooded.
It's raining here, too. How are you guys?
We're okay.
I called because your Aunt Rita told me about this dragon oil.
Helps you to get pregnant.
For you?
No? Don't be silly.
For Billie.
I opened up a bit about her condition.
Ma, why did you tell her?
Why not?
Your Aunt Rita is family.
Besides, dragon oil's a harmless herbal oil, isn't it?
Ma…
Let it go. Just tell Billie. I've got it here.
Here, have some of the beef soup I cooked.
You'll love this, for sure.
I let it stew for three hours. Meat's falling off the bones.
Thank you, Gina.
Ma'am, you're absolutely blooming.
Your child will have the prettiest face I'm sure.
Both of you have got handsome faces.
Gina!
What's the problem?
You make babies when you're on a honeymoon, right?
Would you like me to get you some bowls?
Gina… Maybe later.
If you don't feel like eating yet, I'll come back later.
Got it.
All right, thank you.
Come on!
Mama was just joking.
Oh, my God.
Is it still a joke to you?
Or don't you get it because you're not the one they're gossiping about?
It's only my aunt.
Yeah, but that's the thing.
Now there are two other people making decisions about my body.
I know that. That's why I told her to stop, didn't I?
Yes, but I don't think you explained it well enough
because she still doesn't understand that we already had a deal.
Because it's hard.
I don't think my mom believes
that us not having a child is fine with me.
Once we move to the townhouse,
why don't you move your shop online instead of setting up at bazaars?
I don't want that. I prefer the bazaars. I interact with humans.
Or make music again. Why don't you ask your father for help?
Ask Enrico Neri for help?
No. Not worth it.
Every time we talk, he'd always remind me I owe him this condo.
"You should be thankful I bought you a roof over your head."
If I ask him for help with anything music related,
I'll never hear the end of it.
Well…
It would be great, though.
Okay.
Forget about it.
I don't want to hear any more swearing directed at me.
You know how I get rattled whenever somebody says a bad word.
I know.
It's ironic, though, right?
Everyone thinks he's this excellent, kind man.
But when it comes to me, he's anything but.
I want to think it's just normal for parents to be like that,
but when I remember what you told me
about what he said when you were a kid.
"To learn how to swim, you should be thrown into the water."
That's hardcore.
That's not the worst of it.
But I did learn how to swim.
You didn't tell anyone?
Who could I tell? My mother's in denial.
Should I have said, "Hello, guys! My father beats me"?
How would that go?
No, 'cause I was thinking, when it's our turn to have children,
I could never do anything like that.
I don't think you ever have to worry about that.
What's this?
You got checked? Are you pregnant?
Sadly, no.
I have…
What's that?
Cancer? Do you need surgery?
When was your last checkup?
Too many questions. One at a time.
What's wrong? I don't understand.
No, 'cause you know I don't get my monthly periods?
That's why you thought…
But when I talked to Dr. Castillo,
I'm not pregnant, but she said there might be an issue.
So that's her diagnosis.
That I have premature ovarian failure.
Just the name alone is depressing.
I don't get it.
I'm not clear on the details either but I guess it's safe to say
that my ovaries are a flop and I might never bear children.
Let's look for another doctor.
Love, I've been to two doctors.
Then let's find someone else.
I don't want to. They all say the same thing.
Hormone therapy. I don't wanna do that.
Why not?
Because it's not 100% guaranteed anyway.
And there's so many hoops to go through. So many side effects.
What if I can't handle it?
Why?
Wouldn't you be okay with us just getting a puppy, or…
a plant?
At least we won't have a hard time.
Come on, Billie. We can still try IVF.
We can't possibly afford that.
I'll save up for it.
Don't, it's a waste of money.
-And to be honest, I've made up my mind. -Made up your mind about what?
That if ever,
I'm okay with not being able to get pregnant.
Hey.
You don't get to decide that by yourself.
Yes, right.
So as early as now, I'm giving you a chance.
Would you like to
put off the wedding, so you can think things through?
Where'd that come from?
I don't want you to wait for nothing.
And I don't want that either.
So you don't want children, and you don't want to get married?
It's not that I don't want to. But this is the body that was given to me.
What can I do about it?
You can do something. You just don't want to try.
I don't want to hurt you. And I don't want to get hurt.
Is there nothing more we can do?
-There's one option. -See? We do have options.
-Have children with someone else. -How did you jump that far?
Now, don't get mad at me.
I'm giving you a chance to back out right now.
At least you'll get what you want.
We're getting married, aren't we?
What other reason is there? I love you.
That's why we're getting married.
-Gina? -Yeah?
Hey!
You tell Mr. Jecs.
Go on.
Tell him.
Sir.
Sir.
Yes?
Francis has something to say.
Okay.
Sir…
Sir, with this weather we can still go to town…
We ran out of gas and I was thinking maybe we can buy supplies while it's still safe?
Sure.
Here, can you get me some cigarettes?
Sir, how about Ms. Billie? She might want something?
I think she's still asleep.
-Okay. -Okay, sir.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Mama meant nothing by it. You know her, she just wants a grandchild.
I know.
But she doesn't get it.
She doesn't, because she's not the one I'm married to, right?
Don't worry, I'll sit her down next time we see each other.
That I should've done much earlier.
You're right as usual.
It's Dad.
Hey, don't answer it.
Maybe he wants to say sorry.
My dad, say sorry?
You saw how he treated me. You were there.
Sit down.
You're early, sir.
What would you like to drink, sir?
Water's fine.
Just water for you?
Your Auntie Tessie doesn't want me drinking anymore.
Is she coming?
I think she has a meeting with the Rotary.
It's our third year anniversary…
And we wanted to wait for everyone but since you're asking--
We're getting married.
Just us and some close friends.
So you can get a divorce.
Are you serious?
Daddy, that's really your advice?
And I know not everyone understands what's expected of us.
Don't you think that's unfair to Billie and to us, sir?
Don't just assume we'll end up like you and mommy.
I don't even know what…
Can you call it a career, whatever it is you're doing right now?
Musician? Online seller? You even taught English to Koreans, right?
At least, I survive.
Your mom still sends you an allowance.
I bought you a condo.
I can support Billie well enough, sir.
And that's all I ever hear from you, everyday since I was young.
Is this really how you show your support, Daddy?
I didn't come here to be scolded by you.
You little bitch.
Why do you enjoy pissing me off so much?
Now, if you're just going to act the same way with--
When I make a mistake, Jecs does not punish me.
He doesn't raise his voice at me, he doesn't cuss me.
And most of all, he doesn't beat me up.
So?
He's not here?
He's not coming?
He found another reason to punish me.
A word of warning to the residents along coastal areas of Regions Four and Five.
The low-pressure area is expected to stay in those regions.
Shit.
-Love! -Sorry. I was gonna shoot a vlog.
Don't worry, it's probably gonna come back.
Let me turn on the flashlight.
There we go.
I saw a candle somewhere here.
Here.
Shine the light over here.
I got it.
Does this thing work or what?
There.
Give me a sec.
Let me light the other one. Where's your lighter?
-Let me get my smokes from upstairs. -Go.
Hassle, just when I was about to vlog.
Love, the wind is so strong. It's scary.
Come on, let's eat.
What are you looking for?
My power bank.
Why are you smoking?
You'll shoot a vlog, right? Here's the power bank.
Your battery will run out.
Are you mad?
I don't know.
The power went out and the first thing you think about is vlogging.
I had it scheduled today.
Even if the power's out and there's no signal?
I know why.
You're so eager to vlog
because you get to interact with what's-her-face with the big boobs?
You mean Sunshine. My fan.
You're on a first-name basis.
Come on, Billie. What's wrong with her tagging me in her posts?
It's a big help to me.
You're following her?
Sure, 'cause her followers would tag me, too.
It'd be weird not to like the posts.
So you like her posts, too!
Of course. It's nothing.
Nothing? Didn't…
you have something back then?
See? I remember.
-Your food's getting cold. -No, answer me.
Don't laugh at me. Why are you laughing?
'Cause you're so cute when you're jealous.
I'm not jealous. I just want to know the truth.
You're stirring up trouble bringing it up like that.
Yeah, so what happened between you and Sunshine?
All right, fine. We flirted for a bit--
How exactly?
Okay, no. I was just joking so you can drop it.
Just eat. It's gonna get cold.
Hey, shithead,
why didn't you include "What If" in your lineup?
-I've been playing that for three years. -Exactly.
-That's what your audience came to hear. -Then I'll play it towards the end.
-If somebody requests for it. -Of course they will, asshole.
So just play it at the start so it's over with.
Okay, fine. I'll do it.
-Hey, Shine. What's up? -Hi!
It's been a long time. Where did we last see each other?
At Konnichiwa, Angelo's bar in San Antonio.
Right?
I don't know.
No, no, she's right.
Fuck, we were shooting Jägers that time. We were all fucked up. Right?
Just you.
You drink yourself blind.
Right?
We even drove you home.
Isn't that right, Jecs?
-Were you guys together? -I can't remember.
Old age getting to you?
You drove him home
and then, you drove me home.
And then--
Wait, wait, wait.
Before I forget, can you guys do a collab?
I don't have time.
I better get back to setting up.
In a foul mood, is he?
Let him be.
Do you think of me
The way I think of you
Let's all give him a hand!
I'm falling for you
I love you, Jecs!
Can I come and see you
What's happening?
He just stopped.
Why?
What if I never will?
Tomorrow won't be the same without you
I'll just sing my heart out
I don't really know, maybe I am…
Hello, Ma? What's wrong?
Hello, bro. Nothing! Ma's just worried.
Why is your video all blurry?
The typhoon hasn't left yet?
It's raining pretty hard out here.
Can we switch to voice call?
I need to conserve my battery.
We don't know when the electricity's gonna come back.
Wait, did you mention the dragon oil to Billie yet?
I can send it over.
You don't have to do that.
She won't drink it. We'll talk about it later, Ma.
A grandchild is all I'm asking.
Out of all the women,
you had to fall in love with the barren one.
Ma.
This is so good.
I really need to go. Bye.
-Bye! -Bye, son.
Love, let's have some snacks.
What do you have?
Sardines, your favorite.
Don't feel like it.
And I brewed some coffee. I don't want to eat alone.
I'm not hungry.
So, Mama called?
Yeah, she's worried about the storm.
Yeah, she's worried about the storm.
Why did you laugh earlier?
-When? -On the call.
Which part?
When your mother called me barren.
No, it's nothing.
-It's not what you think. -It's not "nothing."
It was an insult. What happened isn't my fault, okay?
Billie, why are you taking that seriously? Didn't I tell you,
Mama's just requesting for a grandchild.
I've been telling you that over and over. You're being so…
Being so… what? Stupid?
Is that what you wanted to say? That I'm being stupid?
Did I say that? I said nothing like that!
Why are you driving me up a wall like I did something wrong?
Fuck this life!
You're just like Daddy after all.
I didn't cuss at you, okay?
I'm just frustrated by all of this.
You're directing your anger at me. It was Mama who said it, not me.
That's why I don't understand why you're pissed at me.
I didn't do anything.
You're not doing anything.
Is that a crime?
When your mother tattled to your Auntie
that I'm never gonna get pregnant, did you get mad?
When your mother called me barren, did it upset you?
I asked you earlier why you laughed, you denied it.
I wasn't laughing at you. I just realized that Mama's so old-school.
Then why aren't you defending me?
The situation wasn't that dire.
-What do you call it? -It's called…
We can still have a baby.
The doctor said we still have a chance, right?
We've been through this, Jecs.
I told you before we got married I don't want to have children.
You said, "Our love will be enough," and now I need to…
have a child with you?
Will you love me more if I gave you a child?
That's not what I'm saying at all.
Then what do you mean? Because up to now you're still hoping!
Is it wrong to have some hope?
And I'm not forcing anyone.
I'm just saying you can accept that we're not out of options.
Why don't we try them?
-I don't even remember being a child. -Stop yelling.
We're not gonna get anywhere!
We're coming in.
You're finally here.
Hello, we're so sorry for taking so long to get back!
-At least you're safe. -That is true.
The coast guard wouldn't let us sail. The waves were enormous.
I was able to take a video, ma'am. Sir…
We weren't supposed to be back till tomorrow.
We only asked permission from the coast guard.
Were you okay?
We're doing fine.
The power just went out but it's gonna come back soon, right?
It's back. Hang on a second. Let me check.
There we go!
-Power's back! -We have electricity.
Francis…
Sir, ma'am…
Excuse us, we have to inspect our house because our roof got blown off.
-Really? -Yes, ma'am.
-We'll be right back. -Yes.
I just need to tidy up things that got wet.
-We'll be back. -Do you need help?
No need, ma'am. Let me put away the groceries.
I'll bring food with me when I get back.
-Excuse me, ma'am. -We won't be long.
Okay.
The power's back.
I know.
Charge your phone.
I was just about to.
Sorry, Gina. This place is such a mess.
-I'm really sorry. -Not at all. That's okay.
Ma'am.
Not that I'm meddling,
-but is everything okay with you both? -No, yeah, we're okay.
I know those looks, ma'am.
You know, it's normal for couples to argue from time to time.
It's no issue at all.
It's good that you're able to express your frustrations with each other.
But let me tell you this, ma'am,
everything will feel much lighter once you have a child together.
That's a fact, ma'am.
What's this really about?
You know…
if you still don't get it, maybe you don't deserve to know.
How would I know what I don't deserve to know
if you won't tell me?
Sit down.
You're always posting about me being the hashtag perfect wife.
And, I said this upstairs. I don't think you heard me, but I said,
"You're useless, I don't like you, you'll never amount to anything,
nobody will ever stay with you, nobody will ever like you."
maybe he's right.
Even this plant didn't last with me.
Sorry about earlier.
I don't know why I started crying.
Me, too.
I thought someone died.
I threw out your dead plant so you won't have to cry over it.
Are we good?
I already said sorry, didn't I?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for everything.
For everything?
Have you ever had sex with a celebrity? Or anyone famous?
Who?
Where?
When?
That's such a personal question!
Go on, just answer it!
You see, I've been his fan from the start.
When he sings, the rest of the world fades behind us.
Have you guys done the deed? He took you out and everything?
Hey, don't be like that. His wife might see this.
"What If" you accidentally mention his name, what happens then?
"What If" I'm just being honest?
Stop it, darling.
What are you doing in there?
Nothing.
You okay?
Have you guys done the deed? He took you out and everything?
Hey, don't be like that. His wife might see this.
"What If" you accidentally mention his name, what happens then?
"What If" I'm just being honest?
What have I got to do with that?
Nothing!
Nothing?
-Nothing. -Wow.
Why do you even believe anything she says?
What if?
What if everyone who sees this video,
realizes it's you and you're the only one who won't confess to it?
What do I have to confess? She's just clout-chasing for her vlogs.
She's screaming for your attention.
What if you're just a gullible viewer
wasting your time reading too much into absolute horseshit?
Am I the only one with that song title?
They didn't say it was a song.
Whatever.
Good morning, ma'am.
Hello.
I'll do it.
If you…
If you need anything else, I'll be in my house.
Francis.
Mr. Jecs.
I was just fixing something on the boat.
Sorry, it looks really dirty right now.
I'll probably have time tomorrow to tidy up.
What's going on with you?
Just out here hiding.
I wanted a moment of peace with my mobile games
without someone nagging me.
What about you? Why are you by yourself?
I needed some time to think.
Mr. Jecs,
I know it's none of my business
but are you guys fighting?
-Is it obvious? -I'm not…
I'm no stranger to those situations.
You can probably still smooth it over with a little sweet talk.
And some gentle touching in the evenings.
But with some action.
She's jealous.
Oh, no. Jealousy?
It's like a shadow, sir.
Always creeping behind us. It's a curse on us handsome men.
Pour a drink for Mr. Jecs.
It's too early.
Sir.
It's never too early when you have a problem.
Besides, it's just one shot.
Tell you the truth, sir,
I just want a break from my wife's constant nagging.
She's like a radio that never runs out of batteries.
It never ends.
It never does.
And if she gets started with her litanies, better bear it in silence.
Else you'd be digging your own grave.
It all comes back to you.
It all comes back to me.
Women like that were destined for us
to test our patience.
Because if I didn't love Gina,
I'd have buried her in the sand along with the trash.
Ma'am?
Did my husband come by?
I didn't see him.
Could I ask you a favor? Maybe Mr. Jecs sent him on an errand.
Jecs went out a while back. I don't know where he's gone either.
Where is that monkey?
Francis told me he'll just clean the beach and the boat.
He's probably drinking with the boatmen from the neighboring island.
Gina!
-Ma'am? -I'm coming with you.
Better drop it, drop it, drop it now
Better drop it, drop it, drop it now
Come on. Let's drop it.
Better drop it, drop it, drop it now
Better drop it, drop it, drop it now
Hey!
Better drop it, drop it, drop it now
Francis!
Hey! What the heck?
What is this bullshit?
What did you tell me?
You said you'll be cleaning the boat and the beach.
Why are you doing the "drop-drop" and getting wasted?
You drive me crazy, I swear to God. I've been looking all over for you.
Gina, it's okay! That's okay!
A toast to our demon wives!
Except you.
Because you're perfect.
No, really.
Because you accept what I do for a living, you've helped my family,
and you're not just
beautiful,
you're also sexy.
You may have small boobs, but you're still sexy.
And…
you're jealous of Sunshine?
Her tits are huge! She's all boobs!
She's got nothing on you!
Do you really want to know if something happened between me and Sunshine?
I'll tell you. I'll tell you the honest truth.
Right now! I'll tell you.
Did something happen?
nothing happened between me and Sunshine.
Nothing at all.
I didn't even kiss her!
She just gave me a blowjob.
Thanks.
See?
See?
See what you did?
Ma!
What now?
Let's just talk tomorrow.
What?
Hello, Dianne.
What happened?
Mama's gone.
What?
She wouldn't listen.
She ate all the things she wasn't supposed to eat.
Jecs, please come home.
She called me last night. I didn't pick up.
You didn't know this was going to happen.
I feel like she's still about to call.
Ask me how I'm doing.
Ask for her phone's password.
How's Dianne?
You?
Drowning.
And us?
I don't know.
I'm sorry for the things I said.
For everything that I did to you.
I'm sorry for leaving.
I don't know why you came back.
I feel like…
I'm running out of breath.
Me too.
I'm also drowning.
