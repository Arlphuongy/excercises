Kabir, say a prayer before you leave.
Let's get moving!
Kabir, our video has crossed a million views.
Let him be, Tony.
Kabir is a bit silent, isn't he?
He's angry. Why?
Because he lost his mother, and now his home.
He's angry about moving to Old Delhi.
Titu, your scooter!
Asshole, wearing blinkers, are you?
You moron!
Are you mental?
-Hey, don't you dare hit me! -Well, your truck hit my scooter first!
-Stop shouting! -Should I start singing then?
Stop!
Kabir, let go of him!
Hey, what's going on! Stop fighting!
The driver made a mistake.
Greetings, Uncle.
Snake dance! Snake dance?
Stop it!
-Pick up your scooter. -Uncle, I am Ved Prakash's son.
Saw you in dad's wedding album. You were doing the snake dance.
-He's Dheela's son. Dr. Dheela! -Dr. Dheela?
-That's you? -Greetings, Uncle.
God bless. How's everything? All good?
Help move our things!
-Uncle, this way. -Yes. Let's go.
Careful!
The bag's quite heavy.
Kabir!
-Kabir! -Uncle, follow me!
Mind your head, Uncle.
Nothing's changed here.
-Yes, Uncle. -How's your father Dheela?
All good, Uncle.
An injection costs a dollar now...
-Hello. -Hello.
And the red pill still saves the day!
He's started his own hospital. Keeps busy.
Open the windows. Let the air in.
Anees, there are 32 cartons and bags.
All here.
Hey, where to? For my band rehearsals.
Not now! We're going to Kuljeet's for lunch.
His mother, Beeji, is cooking. Don't miss it.
I'll go fetch dad.
-Take off that garland. -Here, you put it on.
-What do I do with it? -Hey, bring it here!
-Hello, Beeji! -Welcome, son!
Let's go in. It's cold outside.
-Come, everyone. -Come here.
-Coming! -Come here, Mathur.
-Come, let's stand in a group. -Beautiful. See!
Stop sulking, Mittal.
Look here.
Pout, everyone.
-Pout? -Here!
Wait!
Dr. Dheela is here!
-Mr. Dheela! -He’s slow, just like his name.
Let's pout.
Done.
Take them off!
Come, take a selfie with Beeji.
This kiss can heal.
It will make your skin glow!
Look how beautiful we look!
-Eat now. -I need a spoon.
Who eats Rajma Chawal with a spoon?
Exactly.
I always eat with a spoon.
No problem. Sapna, get him a spoon.
This is the new generation.
Anees, a few spoons, please.
You know, the dress that I'm wearing...
your mother had given it to me 15 years ago.
You remember?
Even now people ask where it's from. It's still in fashion.
It's your mother who taught me about style and fashion.
I didn't know anything.
I don't think you know how mod your mother was.
If she would've been here, she'd have made me cut my hair short--
-What happened? -Kabir!
You crocodile!
Why did you have to be a drama queen?
Didn't even let him eat the rajma!
How could he? He remembered his mother!
What's more important? "Ma" or "Rajma"?
You missed the rehearsals and didn't show up for the gig either.
-Tony's pissed off! -He can go to hell!
He says the same to you.
He has started a new fucking band without us.
Anees Uncle! Water!
Potty is potty.
What difference does it make if it's Indian or western?
Hello, Uncle.
He smiled.
-That smile cost me 9870 bucks. -Is it?
Bought an English throne for my spoilt child.
Wow! Such delicious food!
Titu's wedding. Traffic jam. Waste of money.
You have something to say to me or not?
Take those off.
Do you have a tongue?
Can you speak at all?
What do you want to hear?
Tell me. I am listening.
Do you have anything to talk about?
Tell me!
If he won't talk to you, learn to "chat" with him.
Son, it's important to to keep up with the technology.
She's right.
Tell me. If I learn all this...
this communication gap between me and Kabir...
can it be fixed?
I'll explain.
The awkwardness we feel face to face... vanishes with this device.
This generation speak with their fingers rather than their mouths.
What if, at this age, I am unable to learn?
If she can, anybody can.
Excuse me! I'm a Science graduate!
Home Science doesn't make you a scientist!
Okay, Beeji. Here.
Put that technology stuff into my phone.
This phone is no good.
What's wrong with it?
You need a smart phone.
It is smart.
You are, not your phone.
Beeji, stop making me spend so much.
He's saying he wants Facebook in this phone!
You guys are insulting me!
Sir, this is the hottest item in the market right now.
In this you'll get a 64-bit Octa core processor.
With a 16 GB memory.
And a 14 centimeter HD screen.
Okay...
It's an auspicious day.
The phone will bring me luck if I buy it today.
Sir, which internet plan would you prefer?
The 4G plan.
-2G is fine. -Uncle...
4G is the internet speed.
You are talking about GB. Forget 2 GB. 1 GB should do for you.
Kabir, your dad is on Facebook.
He's sent me a friend request.
Brilliant!
What a tune!
Here, 1000 bucks from me.
I belong to the Mughal Family.
Nobody says no to us!
Keep it!
Son, I have not eaten all day. Please lend me 40 bucks.
Come on, one more.
Two more. Properly!
This is our version of Zumba.
It helps his hip injury.
Tell me, in how many working days will Kabir get my request?
It takes just a second!
Everything happens instantly on the internet.
I'll teach you.
Have some sweets.
Let's see what he says.
Look at this! He's rejected your request!
He's even blocked you.
He rejected me?
Now listen to what's right... which may sound a bit wrong.
But it's still right. Come here.
-Which one do you like? -Why?
-This is to relax you. -What are you saying, Beeji?
Not for you, stupid.
For Kabir.
-This one. -Isn't she gorgeous?
Seeing her, Kabir will fell in love!
Auntie, please!
Auntie, we're not going to run away!
Why can't I cry at the right time?
Seher, how could you?
Who splurges rent money on booze?
We're screwed!
Saturday nights do this to me.
I could loot the country on a Saturday.
It's disgusting.
-Take a loan from Baljeet. -Baljeet?
He'll start planning our wedding.
Your life's so full of complications!
How about you taking a loan for a change?
It's an art.
Not everyone has that talent.
Quite right.
Go through hell like me and then you'll learn.
-Anupji is here. -Anupji!
We're done for!
Your wife is kicking us out!
What will we do now?
Leave it to me.
Anupji, your beard! Why did you dye it?
The salt & pepper looked so good on you.
Just like George Clooney.
-Right? -So Clooney!
Go, give it to her.
Anupji!
Sukhi!
It's me! Open up!
Sukhi, open the door!
There you are. Look, I got vegetables for you.
Here.
I kept it for essentials.
Thought you'd have pity on us.
There was an inactive account of a girl.
I saved her photos and created a new account, in the name of Tara.
I use this account to chat.
Beeji has many fake accounts.
Rahul, Reuben, Michael...
Son, use Tara's account to send a request to Kabir.
Why should I become this girl?
Because, a request from a hottie like Tara will never be refused by any boy!
I still don't see why... -I mean... -Don't get confused.
-I mean... -Don't get confused. It's simple.
You need to become Tara so you can chat with Kabir. Simple!
Her face, your words.
Under this guise, you'll be able to talk to your son.
I get it.
At least we will talk. You're right!
Send the request.
-Go on, Beeji. -I'm doing it.
I've set the Facebook account for you. Now enjoy gossiping with Kabir.
Awesome.
He's accepted Tara's friend request. Look.
He blocked his father's request
but the girl's face made him accept it in seconds.
You'd have done the same.
Go on, reply.
I don't know how to do this. You reply.
Okay, tell me.
"I saw your photo... and my heart sang."
LOL? Is he cussing me?
LOL means, "Laugh Out Loud!"
After ages I've heard my child laugh.
LOL, ILY, XOXO, BRB... these are chat codes.
Mug it up and become trendy.
Be romantic or else your kid will run away.
Yet, you sent the request.
If you don't want to be friends...
then unfriend me, block me, cancel me.
-Show her the new stock. -My husband doesn't like that style.
He'll run away!
Show me something else.
He won't run away. In fact, he'll stop doubting you.
Why not show her that one?
Here. The cups have a firm grip.
That reminds me. I'd like a cup of tea. Two cups of tea, son.
You're at a ladies' shop. Mind your language.
I'm out of here!
Jobless by choice! And you?
Me, too!
Ask him where he works.
"Where do you work?"
He says Larsen & Toubro.
Bloody liar!
-Should I write that? -Don't be stupid!
JK, boss.
Who's JK? JK means, "Just Kidding!"
Don't start now.
Now write. "How much do you earn?" Okay.
You sing well.
But for this place, we need something big.
You don't even have a band.
Get in touch when you form one.
All couples here. How will we find our guinea pig?
That's the problem!
-What should we do? -Excuse me.
Hello, respected ma'am. How do you do, respected ma'am?
You girls need company?
We need limited company.
Not unlimited.
Seher, you crazy? He owns a Merc!
So? It must be rented.
Look at his shoes. He's wearing Niki instead of Nike.
You've spent a year with me! Still not learnt to observe?
-Sorry! -When will you learn?
-Hello, sir. How are you? -What's up, brother?
-Shit! Run! -Seher!
-Single! -Seher baby!
Seher baby! Why are you running away? Excuse me, sir!
-Stag entry not allowed, sir. -That's my girlfriend!
-You'll stop me? -Yes, sir.
What are you saying!
Look into my eyes and say, "Stag entry not allowed."
Once more.
Who's the new chick? You don't tell me anything these days.
She's a Facebook friend from Canada.
Wish she was from here.
I have some strange connection with her.
I don't understand all this.
Got the bill?
-Yes. -Shall we go? Sure.
Tell me something. How did this connection happen?
From Old Delhi to Canada... with a chick called Tara!
Shit! Looks like the bill is on us tonight.
You'll only have a soda, right?
Just go a little slow on this Tara/Facebook gig.
-Why? -Because, it happened with me once.
-What? -Her photograph was stunning.
Met her, and "she" was a "he."
-Face of a girl, stuff of a man. -Seriously?
You son of a... Are you mad or what?
You motherfu... Mo... Mo...
Your eyes are innocent. Keep it that way.
Why are you laughing?
His number plate has a 9999 on it. A VIP!
-Did you see his revolver? -It's okay.
By the way, did you know that your dad and Tony are Facebook friends?
I wonder why our parents are on Facebook now.
I don't have a dad. So, my mom is my friend.
Not just on Facebook, even in life.
Mom is no more, and Dad isn't my friend. Neither on Facebook, nor in life.
Tell me once and for all.
Do you intend to do your MBA or not?
I don't want to.
Your phone keeps you busy all day, doesn't it?
Same goes for you these days. Sit down!
You won't be the one to always leave the table.
It's my turn today!
Anees! The food was too spicy today!
I feel like running away.
Why? He is so selfish.
I'm in this godforsaken Old Delhi because of him.
He said, "I want to move to Old Delhi to be with my friends."
He didn't bother about me and my friends.
My band broke up because of him.
That house holds the memories of my mother.
I hate Old Delhi.
If you hate it so much, why don't you just leave?
-Eat your food. -Yeah, I will.
First, read this.
"My Dad wanted me to study Law. So that I could manage his law firm.
But I wanted to go to Canada.
Now that Canada has failed, and I've lost him too...
I feel, maybe I should have done Law."
You really regret not studying Law?
Yes.
You know, Kuljeet...
fathers are never wrong about their children.
Write this too.
"Fathers are very important in this world.
We should value them while we have them."
Bloody blackmailer!
It's not blackmail.
It's called, "creating an impact."
You bet! Now eat.
-Sapna made it specially for you. -Alright.
-The impact is made! -What's he saying?
"It depends on your parents.
My mom was important for me. But my dad..."
Dad?
"Is not important at all."
That's what he said?
You got your musical flair from your mom?
How did you guess?
From what you say, it seems your father's a duffer.
Not a duffer.
Whenever my mom sang, he fell asleep.
Kabir, try to understand your dad.
You only see your own pain...
not your father's loneliness.
Imagine what it feels like to lose a partner!
What happened?
Nothing. It's getting cold. Should I get your shawl?
Okay.
My mom used to sing this song.
Should I send it to you? Listen to it on your headphones.
Now where will I get headphones from?
Yes, Anees Uncle?
Bro, I need your ears' thing. What's it called?
This thing around your neck.
Lend them to me. My speaker's not working.
I have an extra.
-Will this work? -Yes, thank you.
When I look into your eyes I see
Our story
Bits of you and bits of me
Make our story
Our conversations have no Beginning or end
They blend into each other Like nights and days
You begin where I finish and I begin where you finish
That's our story
When I look into your eyes I see
Our story
-Kabir. -Yes, Papa?
Here.
Don't give your headphones to Anees. He doesn't bathe for weeks.
Son, I was thinking... why not start a new band?
It's not that easy.
Son, please do something in your life. I'm worried about you.
And my financial situation is not...
What happened? Nothing happened. Just that...
I am here for you but I won't be there forever.
My dad wrote a poem for my mother.
Can you make a song out of it?
What do you think? Isn't he just like his mother?
Thank God he's not like you.
Stop taunting me all the time. Thank your stars I didn't kill you.
Your wife told me everything on Facebook.
How Ahuja fucked you over in business.
Now you want to fuck me over by reminding me of it?
You rejected my business offer... to partner with that bastard Ahuja.
"I must move to New Delhi. I must get out of here!
It's so crowded here. So dirty! I need to get out!"
Imagine if you had not left!
We would have been together all these years.
Mathur, it's Kabir calling.
Yes, Kabir?
What is your favourite color?
-Why? -I am buying headphones for you.
That's why I asked.
Let me see. Red sounds good.
Okay, Papa.
Kabir is buying red headphones for me.
Don't you think Kabir has changed for good ever since you became Tara?
I think so.
Nobody doubts your talent, Seher.
But this time, it was a bit of a struggle to get an appointment.
She takes a lot of leaves, Mrs. Gulati.
Actually, I wasn't feeling too well. You know, ladies' problem...
When are you returning the 10,000 bucks you owe me?
Very soon.
-Actually, that... -Seher, this is not right.
-What are you doing, Paro? -Sorry!
-Paro! -I am sorry!
"How will the world understand the noise inside me?
Oh, Lord. Silence this noise!"
He's talking about our song on YouTube.
-Please meet my band, please! -What are you doing?
Brother... for us guitar is no more!
If your guitar mix our sax, Delhi on fire!
And you, small timers... this is my musical YouTube star!
I'm Ghannu.
I am Fantu.
Let's see that ass shakin' Let's see the booty movin'
Let's see what you got Oh, baby doll
Oh, baby doll!
You wear the glow of the sun
Oh, my Delhi!
Bruised by many
Yet unclaimed you stand
You stand bright and tall
Such is Delhi
My good old Delhi!
Anees Uncle, you've always lived alone here?
Why? Don't you have a home? Family?
Old Delhi is my only home.
For me, its every lane is filled with memories.
I had an affair with your father's sister.
Aunt Neelu?
It lasted five years... in silence.
Her smile? It would speak!
Wherever her rickshaw went, my Yezdi followed.
"Scram!"
Does dad know?
I didn't let your aunt know. How would he?
Why?
Because I am a Muslim and...
Anees Uncle, you could have eloped.
Don't be crazy.
Why leave my magnificent Old Delhi for a love affair?
What's so special about Old Delhi?
You still have this toy?
Remember how your dad would fly you around the world on this?
Don't be so angry at Old Delhi. New Delhi grew out of it.
What good are these memories?
It's strange... Kabir.
Try experiencing this place through your mother's eyes.
Turn your pain into hope.
You too had wonderful times there, during your childhood.
I don't remember. In any case...
what's in Old Delhi that you miss so much?
I can't tell you. I can show you!
Someday, we'll go there.
Let's see that ass shakin' Let's see that booty movin'
Let's see what you got Oh, baby doll!
Jackie, bro!
Kabir, Sanju, Babaji.
Just turn the Bluetooth on, search and connect. Then play.
It's on! It's working!
It's amazing!
You get the tastiest street food here!
Stop. See that? Your mother's favorite shop.
She loved the samosas here.
-Come, try it. -No.
That is not an option.
Brother, we'll be right back. Come on!
You have to taste it!
-Papa. -What?
I'll be home late.
I have a show tonight.
We've never heard you sing.
He's got his music from his mother.
-She had a beautiful voice. -Really?
Whenever I got back home tired from work her singing would soothe me to sleep.
It was bliss! When will we get to hear your music?
There's a pub called Factory. I'm performing there tonight.
-Please come, all of you. -Sure.
It's my first show with the new band.
Playing for drunkards at a bar?
Doesn't matter. We will be there. Of course, we'll come.
Of course, we'll come. Mittal, Mathur and myself.
After all, it's you performing!
And we'll have a peg each.
I'm here for mom.
Hey, mister! Hello?
-What's the matter? -Who are you?
-Kabir. -Kabir who?
Kabir Mathur. This is my house. Oh! You are Mathur's son?
We have bought this house.
Please leave.
Didn't your father tell you that he sold the house?
-Let's go, Sanju. -What happened?
Your principles, Your rules
Why must I obey at all times?
When I reject your laws
That confine me
It unsettles you
Don't tie me down
Don't restrict me
These rules are a farce So are your laws
Why should I listen to your nonsense?
Oh hypocrite!
You are killing me
With your sweet words
Oh hypocrite!
You are killing me
With your sweet words
Your intentions...
All...
Your promises
Your intentions All your promises
I will reveal the truth
To every one
You deceive, you mislead
Your show of dreams
Selling palaces of lies
Don't play tricks with my emotions
Tomorrow, your apologies won't matter
You'll always be questioned
Then the world will know
You lead a band of dacoits
Oh hypocrite!
You are killing me
With your sweet words
Let go of me!
Don't you understand?
-Bloody asshole! -Tara? Hi!
-That's Tara! -What?
Tara from Facebook! How come you are here?
I can't believe it.
Me too.
Check out that kiss! -What are you looking at? -The kiss, what else?
Bloody motherfucker!
-Run! -Why?
Seher, we're screwed! What's going on? Let's go!
-Tara, why are we running? -Just run!
When did you come back from Canada?
Wait for me!
-Tara, stop! -Come on, hurry!
Get out of the way!
Tara, you are so different on Facebook!
I'm not on Facebook, you prick!
-Drive, mister! -Seher! Don't go!
Asshole, just wait! I'll play you like a fucking guitar!
Asshole, just wait! I'll play you like a fucking guitar! Bastard! Where's the valet? Where's my Audi?
Bastard! Where's the valet? Where's my Audi? Kabir, what a performance!
Liar.
Another lie.
You're always lying!
I think he's figured it out.
Selling the house was my last resort!
I was about to tell you.
All you do is lie. It's a habit with you.
What have I lied about?
Mom's accident? When I got to know, you said it was minor.
So minor that she died? You shirked spending on a good hospital.
That's the truth you never told me. You saved your money!
Now, you sold our house! It was only about the money, right?
How dare you!
Where are you going? I am talking to you, Kabir!
The truth is, I was completely broke.
After your mother's death I was buried in debts.
Then, Ahuja betrayed me. He cheated me.
I was forced to sell our house. I was about to tell you!
-Kabir! -Kabir, what are you doing? Leave me alone!
Don't do this! Boss...
Get the fuck out and never show me your face again!
Just get out!
Good-for-nothing!
A light, brother?
I hope you're not considering suicide.
Don't! It's very painful.
I had tried it once.
It hurt like a bitch.
I'll talk to him and get back to you, Uncle.
-Your dad called again. -I must find that guy who cussed at me.
Leave that for now. Just call your dad.
He's worried sick. He's called me ten times already!
He has many others to look after him.
Can I stay at your house or not?
I know you're upset but don't consider everyone selfish.
-Or a liar! -They are all liars!
-What! -I need to find her! Go to hell!
Tara, why did you lie?
I think it's Kabir's message.
If you're not on Facebook, then who are you?
I know you're in Delhi. Why did you lie?
Did you hear that, Beeji?
Don't give me that look.
My intentions were right. Good, the girl didn't say much...
or I'd be registered a liar, right?
Beeji... this is all a mess!
You meant well but it's gone wrong.
You can't just kiss me and run off!
The lies are getting to him, both yours and Tara's.
But I am Tara! True.
-Oh, God! -What's he saying now?
I'll go to the cyber police. I'll find you, no matter what.
Beeji, it's all got out of hand. Be quiet!
I swear to God... I thought it through, technically.
The girl I found... wasn't from here.
And she has been inactive on Facebook for a year and a half.
Trace her, for heaven's sake.
Do whatever it takes or else we are all done for.
But where, in this huge city?
Let me see her picture.
Let's zoom-in on her picture.
Look. Abu Road, Meerut. Meerut?
That's the board.
Excuse me.
Do you recognize her?
Benny sir!
What's wrong?
-What is it? -Look here. Isn't she the same girl? That lawyer's son's friend.
Isn't she the same girl? That lawyer's son's friend. Yes, she studied here.
Her name is Seher Chowdhary. She had scored a 92%.
Where can we find her? Go to Victoria Park, towards Cantonment.
You'll reach All Saints School.
Ask for Warden Ratan Chowdhary. She's his daughter.
This one! Pause here.
This girl? She's a gold digger, sir.
Pause here.
And that is Baljeet.
That's the VIP! He almost ran us over.
-He's the one? -Yes.
He's the one who cussed at me!
Stay away from him. He's a hothead.
Are you in love with this girl?
Let's go for rehearsals.
Kabir! What's wrong with you?
Our new band is a hit.
Music labels are interested. We're getting gigs. And you--
I want to know why she lied to me.
-Hello. -Hello.
We wanted to meet Seher Chowdhary.
Listen, her antics have troubled us a lot. We have no idea where she is.
Please, leave us alone. Sir, we've come a long way--
I told you once. Please leave.
But, sir... Please leave!
-We must look for her somewhere. -Such an insolent man!
Let's go back to Delhi.
Uncle!
This is the contact number of the salon where Seher works.
She's in Delhi.
When I need to talk to my sister, I reach her on this number.
-The bruise? -It's nothing.
-Sir, let's blow-dry your hair. -Okay.
250 bucks for a shave? 250!
Madam, what's the cost of cleaning the nails?
The luxury manicure is only 1000 bucks. 1000 bucks!
And whatever you're doing to him?
-1000 bucks without the tip. -What!
Seher, before we go broke...
I need to talk to you for just two minutes.
Uncle, have you lost your mind?
Sorry! But what's all this? Disgusting!
Uncle, this is a crime.
You may not be aware... but what you've done is a cyber crime.
You should know.
Child, a father and son chat is led by emotions.
Please try to understand.
Stop trying to get us all sentimental!
I'm going to call the police.
Just wait. Read this chat once. Here's the username and password.
-Why should I read this rubbish? -Exactly!
Get out of here!
We're not here to chat! We've work to do.
Don't think women are weak. That they can be harassed.
I'm telling you, we women have reached the moon.
And we will go beyond. We'll go wherever we like whenever we like.
Gone are the days when you married us off
Gone are the days when you married us off to make babies for all our lives...
Get out!
-Stop bothering us! -Come on, Mittal!
They're troubling us!
"Read the chat," he says!
What's bothering you, Mathur?
I am scared.
So is the Tara inside me.
Both hopes lost at one go.
Type this...
Type this... Address it to Kabir.
"I had my reasons... for not recognizing you."
Attend to your work.
-Did he reply? -Yes.
Tara, you may have your reasons not to recognize me.
But now I have my reasons to find you.
And I will, at any cost!
I saw you as the truth which became a lie.
We have to get this girl on our side.
Your son is in love.
100% in love.
This one-sided love can destroy you.
I have experienced it.
Let's go. Hurry!
Hey! Mind the shop. I'll be back.
I don't want to listen to anything!
Don't you get it? This is where I work!
I'll call security! I'll call the police!
Get out!
Return our aprons!
Madam, please listen to me!
-Give back our aprons. -Please, let me explain.
Spent so much in there. Let us speak to her at least.
-No! -Take your bloody frock!
-I just need two minutes with her! -Mathur! Let's go!
What about the shit on our faces?
We'll wash it at home!
Sharma's got a gig for us.
I need to get back to him. Say something!
Grab the guy in the blue shirt!
-What's your problem smarty pants? -What the fuck!
Yes, sir.
Our band is called Darbaris. You sister-fucker!
No, not you, sir. Yes, sir. Okay.
Kabir? We play in the same band, sir.
How dare you kiss my GF! Interview?
Just like your father!
Always fighting!
Got thrashed? Or thrashed them too?
Seher, please open the door.
I swear, I'm sorry.
I made a mistake! I didn't mean to hit you!
Mistake? I also kissed that guy by mistake!
Who kisses by mistake?
Never happened to me!
You gotta be kidding! How does that even work?
Show me.
-Here, slap me. Slap me! -Let me be!
Slap me! But please forgive me.
What are you doing here? Step aside!
I need to talk to her! Leave!
Seher, I didn't come here to be rude.
Let's party! You'll feel better.
I'll eat your finger!
Don't show me the middle finger!
Don't ever ask me for money again! Showing me the middle finger!
Here's a middle finger for you!
And another one!
You know what you are?
Remember the film where the guy calls his business buddy a disgusting asshole?
That's what you are. Gold digger!
You're the epitome of disgusting!
Guard, open the gate.
I've been waiting forever!
Look who's here!
What do you know? The kiddies are back!
No one touches my car!
If anything happens to my Audi I'll lose control!
Motherfucker!
I'll knock your sister up!
Bloody motherfucker!
Put the blanket over him!
Help! Mommy!
That's Baljeet!
And that guy whose song is trending.
Hit that swine one more time! A couple more!
Isn't this blackmail?
First, I need the money. And second...
Uncle, look... who would do this for free going out of their way?
who would do this for free going out of their way?
-How much? -Just 50 grand for one meeting.
What! 50 grand for nothing?
Nothing? I read the entire chat.
It's a royal mess!
Okay, deal.
-But you must clean up the mess. -Don't worry.
Our girl here is an expert in these matters.
Cash or cheque?
We don't want to end up paying tax.
-Cash! -What!
Okay, we'll pay you tomorrow.
The thing is... our singer is unwell.
We lost another gig.
Guys, we are musicians not criminals.
Why are we busy bashing people up? Everything's fair in friendship.
Son, anger is a bad thing.
It affects the melody.
Yeah.
Babaji, I've found my melody.
Metro Barakhamba?
That Baljeet has gone nuts!
May I call you tomorrow?
I'll confirm and let you know. Speak up.
-Shit! Run! -But...
-Kabir, what's going on? -Don't stop! Hurry up!
Where are we going?
-Kabir! -Where are you...
Hurry up!
What happened?
-What's going on? -Excuse me!
What's your problem!
Shut up and come with me!
Who the hell are we running from?
-Come, come! -Where?
Come!
Who are we running from?
Kabir? Kabir!
Bye, Tara!
Kabir!
Now you know how I felt that day when you took me for a spin and vanished.
-Laughing at me, aren't you? -This brat!
Who? -Kabir! -Why?
-Kabir! -Why?
He says, "Now you know how I felt that day... when you took me for a spin and vanished."
This guy is fast.
Paro!
Girl, I don't like where this is going.
-Type this. -What?
"Tomorrow. Your call, time and place."
Get set for round three.
This time I'll wear sneakers.
So why did you say you're not on Facebook?
I didn't want to meet you.
But here I am. I lied.
And... why didn't you want to meet?
I keep my social media and real life apart.
Who is that guy?
The one you beat up under the blanket?
We saw it.
It was right outside our house.
You really gave it to him.
He was a boyfriend type.
You've broken up?
-That asshole hit me. -Really?
Look!
I kissed you that night. He got jealous.
Then you shouldn't have. He was being clingy, my god!
"Love you, baby! I wanted to piss him off.
Want to ask anything else?
I did what you suggested.
-What? -I left my house.
-Can I say something? -Go ahead.
Why not go back to your father?
We complicate things.
Just talk it out. It's that simple.
This causes more complications, Kabir.
You are absolutely right!
I'm going to tell my father straight out that I don't intend to marry right now.
Shall we go? Come on.
We won't meet anymore.
Just the Facebook Tara.
But I find the real Tara more interesting.
Run!
Tara? Tara!
What's this? I like these girls. Both of them.
-Shit! Baljeet! -Was that baby?
I have a black-eye but why can't you see?
Dude, Kabir is a cool guy.
He's different. Don't talk nonsense.
Bitch! I've never seen you pick up the bill for any other guy!
-Right? -Hey!
-For you! -No, thanks!
It's your father's poem. I turned it into a song.
Could you please play this?
Let me protect you
From the world
Come closer
Let me make you
Feel special
Come closer
I couldn't bear
To see you cry
Let me steal away every tear
That ever came to your eye
Let me protect you
From the world
Come closer
Please stop the song.
Why? It's so good.
Yes, Uncle.
Uncle this is Seher, not Tara.
Yes, we met.
No, nothing major.
Uncle, I told him we won't meet again.
If we meet by accident, I'll handle it.
Good that she agreed to play along.
Thank God that I don't lead this double life.
Playing Tara was tough.
Tea for three.
Not me. Make it two. Read this. I don't have my glasses.
Who is it from? Kabir.
Tara, your Facebook person pales compared to the real Tara.
We must meet again.
-I propose round four. -Damn!
That's called modern romance.
Round four, no less!
I got it! I'll pay her some more.
She can pretend to be in love and bring Kabir home by Diwali.
First, get him back to his music.
Second, get him back home by Diwali.
He's my only son.
But... how can one pretend to be in love?
You can, I know.
Yes, Baljeet.
I owe you 25 grand, not 27.
Fine, do the math again.
Can you give me something upfront?
The rest when it's done? Of course.
Take ten grand for now.
The rest, when the job is done.
But I don't know if I can pull this off.
I have faith in you.
So, Prankster? Yeah.
The food here is the best.
You sing so well! I could fall in love.
Go ahead, fall in love.
Who's stopping you?
You need balls to fall in love. I don't have them.
I'm just a serial flirt.
So, you're getting married? My father wants me to, but...
I got back from Canada a couple of years ago.
Is this tattoo permanent? Yes, with a heart-wrenching story.
Which I'm not telling.
Why the kiss?
First, to show that I have the balls. Second, to piss someone off.
-Who? -Baljeet.
Tara, stop running away.
-Tell him the truth. -Let go!
Motherfucker!
I'll bust your balls! How dare you date him while I'm around?
You and I are completely different!
What's this cozy twosome?
It was never you. I fell for your fancy car.
You're lying!
You'll find a great girl one day. Understood?
-He didn't! Listen, Seher.
No, you listen!
You hit a woman again and I'll smash your face!
I'll learn to play the guitar! What else? You'll teach me the guitar, you bastard!
I can't believe your guitar beat my high-speed Audi.
I never saw it coming.
Brother, that's the problem.
It is what's inside that is important.
Not the biceps or the fancy cars.
Come here.
It's really very simple.
Keep your heart out and your money in...
Uncle, I'll call you later.
You're like a brother to me.
Let me know if you ever need anything.
You didn't need to.
Seher...
Seher...
Don't know why
The lines on your palms Are now etched on mine
The words on my lips Are always about you
Don't know why
What is this? Why is this? Surely you too think so
Why are my mornings Filled with your nights
If I don't see you, I feel In some way, incomplete
And my life is meaningless
Meaningless!
Meaningless!
Meaningless!
Don't know why
The lines on your palms Are now etched on mine
The words on my lips Are always about you
Don't know why
I am losing myself
Becoming like others
I get tangled
In meaningless conversations
I feel empty
As I must seem to others
In some way, incomplete
Meaningless!
Meaningless!
Listen, I am curating a music festival.
I really want you guys to perform there. Okay?
I get lost in meaningless conversations
Even my dreams seem empty
When you're not around
I get lost in meaningless conversations
Even my dreams seem empty
When you're not around
Made a wish?
For my family.
Diwali is round the corner.
I really miss my family.
Diwali is always special.
The whole family together!
Fireworks and mom's food.
Papa?
It's... Seher, Papa.
How are you?
I'm fine, too.
Papa, I was thinking of coming home for Diwali.
Okay, Papa.
CHIRAG.
Ready to tell me the heart wrenching story?
This is Chirag.
I loved him, stole money from my parents for him. Paid his fees.
What did I get in return? Betrayal.
He took me for a ride and dumped me in a jiffy.
Then he ran away to Canada.
Is that why you left Meerut?
Kabir, I was pregnant.
I had no option but to run away.
Big tummy in a small town? Without marriage, no way!
I was betrayed by everyone around me.
Seen the Yamuna River bridge, by the bus stand?
I stood there, alone. Suicide did cross my mind.
I felt disgusted with myself.
Fought and reasoned with myself.
Then I went to a random clinic.
Gathered some courage...
and got an abortion.
It could have ruined my parents.
Discipline is all my father knows.
He's a simple man.
Should we go to Meerut for Diwali? I'll come with you.
No. Everyone...
I called dad. Told him I want to come.
He said they won't be home.
He doesn't want me to return, Kabir.
Let's go to Old Delhi this Diwali. We'll celebrate with dad.
Let's celebrate together.
Wishing everyone a very auspicious Diwali!
-Welcome! -Happy Diwali!
Come, Dheela!
Let's go.
Happy Diwali. God bless you.
Go, get your blessings first.
Wait... -How old are you? -I am 62.
You are my age and you're touching my feet?
-Yes. -Keep moving!
-Papa, this is Tara. -Hello, Uncle.
-Papa, this is Tara. -Hello, Uncle. I've got you a kurta.
Oh, lovely!
With your own money?
I am earning now, Papa. Our band is quite popular.
Let me just quickly put this on. Come, let's go inside.
Anees Uncle...
this is for you. A kurta.
Thank you! Bless you!
Kabir got this beautiful silk kurta for me.
Isn't it lovely?
Kabir's got it for me. Cheers to that!
I love seeing you eat Rajma Chawal with your hands.
Now tell me about your band. It's going great, Papa.
What's this?
You're so beautiful. Why this weird haircut?
It looks good.
Yeah. It's a style.
-No way! -Yeah, exactly.
Come for our gig when you're free.
Yes, of course!
Guys, help yourselves...
I'll be back, Papa.
What a firecracker!
Bye, Papa. I'll keep visiting.
Coming upstairs?
Paro?
She's visiting her parents for Diwali.
Some other day.
Anup, get your ass inside!
If I don't kiss you today I'll regret it all my life.
-Sit! -You sit, Uncle.
Which coffee should I order for you?
We'll do all that later.
I had asked you for a small favour. But you didn't deliver.
What? Kabir never came back.
I mean, not for good.
You're free to go now. Let's end this drama.
It's not a drama anymore. That's what I need to tell you.
How amazing!
I asked you to put up an act. You made it real.
I mean... you and Kabir are completely different.
Please go your separate ways.
But we love each other. Please try and understand.
How much more money do you need? Oh, yes! I forgot your Diwali bonus!
Now the deal's over.
I was about to return all your money.
You're an extremely fast girl.
Look at your appearance!
Kabir is a straight-forward guy. Don't be a nuisance.
Got it?
"Let me protect you from the world, come closer.
Let me make you feel special, come closer.
I couldn't bear to see you cry...
help me steal away every tear that came to your eye."
You wrote this for your wife?
I don't believe you're capable of love.
Tara!
-Why aren't you answering my calls? -Because I don't want to.
What do you mean?
I don't want to talk to you, Kabir! Go away!
-Tara, what happened? -I said go!
-What happened? -Go!
Okay.
You want to hear the truth?
I am bored of you.
You know that's how I am!
Now, please go!
God knows what you're hiding this time!
Kabir!
You know how easy it was?
I went home and told my father that I don't want to get married.
And he agreed.
We complicate our lives unnecessarily! It's actually so simple.
Don't cry, child.
Come on, be brave.
I don't understand anymore.
Let's just pretend that Tara never existed!
You found her on Facebook, right? Shut it down.
To hell with Tara! Concentrate on your music.
Move on. Live your life, son.
Good boy. Come on, don't cry.
Son, love is a gift from God!
The world's changing. So should you.
-Beeji, you won't understand. -Son, you try and understand.
Don't interfere in my family matters!
Have you lost your mind?
Behave yourself! Beeji, a cup of tea?
And you guys?
Shut the fuck up! Who do you think you are?
Selfish bastard! You've always been so!
You think only we should maintain friendship?
And you can offer us tea whenever you like?
I kept saying, "Never mind! It's okay!"
Just to avoid confrontation.
And you...
You will sit around and offer us tea? You know what?
Drink that bloody tea by yourself.
Order some snacks to go with your tea.
Everyone is fast for you!
Only you and your son are slow in the whole world?
Why are you so frustrated?
-Am I the frustrated one or you? -Shut up!
That girl took control of your son. That's why you got jealous!
How did she achieve what you couldn't as his father?
Shut up!
You begged me to do business with you.
Ever had a look in the mirror?
The truth is that I did not want to do business with you. That's why I declined.
So, who is frustrated? You or me?
Talking nonsense!
That's it.
I'm done with you.
Go fuck yourself!
Let's leave, Beeji. It's time for your TV soap.
Let's go.
They don't even have a TV.
Can't expect them to have feelings, can we?
Seher, working so late? Let's leave.
I need to make money, Paro.
Borrowed money is poison.
Seher...
I am with you...
Always by your side
What's happened to your leader?
Tell Kabir to call me urgently.
In sunlight
In rain
In victory
In pain
In everything that you ever think Or do
Somewhere between Knowing and feeling
Somewhere between Knowing and feeling I am with you
What's this? The money I owe you.
Really?
I had called you disgusting, right?
You know, you are not even the "D" of disgusting.
Seher...
I finished the beginner's guitar lessons.
This is what's disgusting!
Anupji, Auntie... I can't afford living here.
I'm moving to a hostel. Don't worry.
Sanju?
Back in time. I was about to leave.
-What happened? -Uncle, please talk to Kabir.
The music festival called again. They're getting impatient. Might cancel the show.
Kabir is unable to sing.
I don't know what to do.
I'll talk to him.
Boss!
-Papa! -Boss!
My chest is hurting!
-Anees Uncle! -Is this a heart attack?
Kuljeet Uncle!
Kuljeet!
Is he okay, Doctor?
How is he?
He's okay now, resting.
-Heart attack? -Yes.
You brought him in time.
Anger affects health. He should cool down.
Don't worry about the money.
It's no problem.
You guys should go. Come tomorrow. Okay?
-Go in. -You can go in, son.
Go see your dad.
Don't talk too much.
What's this, Papa?
Come back home.
Why don't you look after yourself?
Please don't be so stubborn.
You don't let anyone take care of you.
Even mom's not with us now.
Don't cry, my child.
I'll be fine, my son.
Don't worry.
You get yourself together.
Stop crying now.
I'm sorry to be this way.
All I know is that I love you, Papa.
Beyond everything else!
Kabir...
let your father rest now.
You need some rest too.
Let me stay a little longer.
Sorry, but this is the ICU.
Come back during the visiting hours.
Don't worry, I'll be here.
God bless.
-I need to return this money. -Tara?
Hold on!
Let's go!
-Where are you going? -Go away!
-Listen! -Leave me alone!
-What was she doing here? -Nothing.
-What are you hiding there? -Nothing. -What is it? -It's nothing!
-What's this? -It's nothing.
-What's this? -Kabir, your father really loves you.
You're such a drama queen. I'll lose my medical license because of you.
I've made a huge mistake.
-What now? -I realized how much my son loves me. You saw how he wept and held on to me?
Let's end this drama. I'm out of here!
Easy. Careful!
Let me out! Bring me my clothes.
Mathur, at least change your clothes. You can't walk out like this.
I can't let that girl leave! Kabir will be shattered.
-It's really cold outside. -Doesn't matter.
Thank you, madam, for the jersey... Sir?
-That's my jersey! -I'll return it.
Mathur, hang on! I'll go with you.
Shut up, Dheela!
Rickshaw!
-No way! -Rickshaw!
I don't want to hear anything! I'm sick of his lies!
-Enough! -Kabir, please!
-Boss? -What happened?
-What happened? -To hell with you all! Kabir, listen!
-Boss! -I was just pretending!
-You're unwell! -Didn't he have a heart attack?
It was no heart attack. But he could get one now.
Boss, I made a mistake. I told him about the whole Tara thing.
He found out about the deal, we're screwed!
-Kabir, stop! -Kabir!
What happened?
He must have gone to Seher, I mean, Tara.
This way or that way? Have you seen Kabir?
No, Uncle, but I tried calling Seher! She's not answering my calls.
She's moved to a girl's hostel.
-Take us over there. -Let's go.
Out of the way!
Anees! Where is Mittal?
-No idea. -Go fetch him.
-How much money did you lose? -Four.
Four million?
Kabir! What's the matter? Wait, son!
Mathur's son is such a...
-Mittal! -Yes?
Kabir has run away!
-He just went this way -What are you saying!
It all started with Mathur's heart attack.
Let's rush to that hostel. Some girl's hostel, ladies' hostel!
Let's go!
Do you know the way?
Call Kuljeet.
Watchman!
-Watchman! -Open up!
Anyone there? Open the gate!
We have to meet Seher Chowdhary urgently.
Sir, it's past visiting hours.
What do you mean?
Open!
There are cameras everywhere. I'll lose my job!
-Look! -Madam's here!
Let's go in.
Uncle, no!
My job is at risk!
Wait! You can't just barge in! It's a girl's hostel.
We need to see Seher Chowdhary urgently! It's not the visiting hours!
We don't have time!
I'm a heart patient! I...
Seher Chowdhary, they're calling you urgently.
She's here.
-Uncle? -Seher!
First, I am so sorry for everything. What I did was horrible.
Kabir's missing. Do you know where he is?
I have no clue.
She doesn't know.
-Think, Seher. -Wait a second.
He installed an app, Find a Friend, on my phone.
Here. Dwarka Metro Station!
Let's get moving!
Let's go!
Where is he?
I don't know. I've lost the network.
No network?
Let's split up. There are three platforms.
You on 1. Myself on 2. You on 3.
Okay?
You look after Beeji.
Beeji, let's wait here.
Uncle, there!
Go talk to him.
Please, don't run. Stop running.
Not from me or yourself.
Sit down.
I don't want to talk to you.
Please, tell me something new.
Like, "I have so much to tell you."
Then even I'll be surprised for a change.
Your mom met with an accident.
She told me it was minor and that I shouldn't tell you.
Because you had your final year exams. So, better not...
She threw up the whole night.
By morning, she was gone.
It was your mother who lied to me. And you made me the liar!
I never told you about the house because...
sometimes you lack the courage to share your failure with your children.
I tried so many times but I couldn't do so.
We both lost the person who had kept us together.
What she left behind was...
your anger, your loneliness, bitterness...
When I ran out of all options...
I created Tara's profile to chat with you.
I got left behind, son.
You had moved a long way.
I made a mistake, son.
A huge mistake.
Behind all this is my love.
I was just unable to tell you so.
Because I never learned to express love with words.
I don't know how...
It was my mistake.
-There they are! -What a sight!
Congratulations!
God bless you, my child.
-Now you can talk to us, right? -Where is Seher?
She took the last train and left this message for you.
What does it say?
I've brought Kabir back home, forever.
It took me a while to understand Seher...
but she is your truth. Don't lose her.
Go get her. Go.
-Go on! -Go on, son!
-Godspeed, son! -Go, Kabir!
-Go! -Be careful!
I'm Kabir.
This is your last chance. Tell me your truth.

-And it’s ours now. We own this. -Mm-hmm.
-I love it. -Right?
What’d I tell you? The fireplace, the built-ins here.
Are you sure you want to give this to your sister?
Babe, we’d make 100K off this flip all day long.
-Trying to make up-- -[Russ] This is it?
[Ellie] Hey, hey, yeah. Come in, come in.
You guys made me ask off an hour early to see this dump?
We’re all smelling this right now, right? Yeah, it smells like I’m breathing piss.
Okay. Not a good fit. So we’ll just go.
-[whispers] Come on. -Come on, have a little vision.
French doors to the garden.
We move the stairs, take these walls down,
create an open concept through the kitchen.
There’s a gorgeous stained glass here in the corner.
The bones are really good.
When’s the part we cough up 12 grand to fix the rotted-out foundation?
Clearly, it’s not for them. Let’s just flip this one, El.
There’s a park across the street.
And the schools here are fantastic if you have a baby. When.
if you have a baby. When. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Kimmy. When, when you have a baby.
I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Kimmy. When, when you have a baby.
We’re having a baby. -We are having a baby. -[Russ] You see that?
-We are having a baby. -[Russ] You see that? That’s called manifesting to the universe.
Sometimes the universe thinks it’s funny if I drop $26,000 on in-vitro first.
-Oh! You’re a dick. -[Russ] I’m kidding!
If this place is so great, why don’t you guys move in here?
What are they gonna do with five bedrooms and a park?
They’re obviously never having kids.
Look at them. No emotional holes to fill.
Not that we are doing it to fill--
-Shut up, Russ. -All right.
-What was that look? -What look?
He just said you guys are never gonna have kids.
Then you did a definite look.
Yeah, there was a look, what was the look for? You looked back at me to try to include me in your look.
-I didn’t do a look. -Totally did a look.
-It wasn’t a look. -I think we started trouble.
-There’s no trouble. -Maybe even a fight.
-There’s no fight, no trouble. -Let’s get out of here.
Oh, my God. You guys are gonna have kids now, aren’t you?
No. What? Kimmy. I don’t know. What?
For sure, because you have to win at everything.
You’re gonna throw your perfect uterus in my face too.
How do you know that my uterus is so perfect? We’ve never even tried to have kids.
I don’t know if I can get pregnant. Of course it is perfect. It is yours.
-Kimmy. -It probably -has a leather interior. -[Ellie] Please, Kimmy.
-has a leather interior. -[Ellie] Please, Kimmy. -You just got here. -Sorry, Petey.
-You just got here. -Sorry, Petey. -Have a good fight. -[Pete] See you later, Russ.
-Have a good fight. -[Pete] See you later, Russ.
What? That's...
-I didn’t do a look. -You’re doing a look right now.
There’s no look. You’re doing a look.
All right, maybe I did do a look.
But just hearing him say it out loud:
"We’re never having children." I mean, is that true?
I quit bringing it up because every time I did, you’d say it’s not the right time.
I know, but we were always so broke.
We were going crazy trying to get the business started.
We’ve flipped five houses this year, and I’m starting to turn down design work.
I always thought that I’d be a mom someday.
-I think I’m ready. -Great.
Now you’re ready. By the time the kid’s 16,
I’ll be one of those old dads, like Brian Hendrickson’s dad.
-Hey, Dad. -What’s up, son?
Hey, Mr. Hendrickson, go long!
Dad?
You killed my dad!
Hey. Hey, Dad. Wake up, wake up. Wake up!
You did not kill Mr. Hendrickson.
-And you’re not that old. -Here’s an idea.
-And you’re not that old. -Here’s an idea. What if we adopt a five-year-old?
It’d be like I got cracking when I was 36. How about that?
[Pete] Keep your end straight, will you?
You’re overthinking it, bro. None of my kids were planned.
Kid shows up, you figure it out. Easy-peasy.
-How many kids you got now, Stu? -Number four’s in the oven.
-Wow. -Nothing hard about kids.
As long as you spend some time with them, they’re cool.
Most important thing, make sure the moms all get along.
-[dog barking] -Meatball. Hey, buddy!
Hey. You miss me? Oh! That’s my boy.
Hey. You miss me? Oh! That’s my boy. You missed me? I missed you too. Yeah. You’re such a good boy.
You missed me? I missed you too. Yeah. You’re such a good boy.
Hey, El. I got the towel samples you wanted for the kitchen.
El, you okay?
Hey, what’s the matter?
Nothing. I was just thinking about what you said about adopting a five-year-old.
-I said that? -Yeah.
-I was totally-- I was joking. -I know. It’s kind of crazy.
But it got me thinking, and there’s so many kids in foster care.
And they’re moving from place to place, and they don’t have anybody.
And it’s like the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.
I found this adoption agency. and they’re having an orientation next week.
No, no, no, don’t show me that. I don’t want to see those little faces.
You trying to break my heart? I just got home from work.
Ellie, people who take in foster kids are really special.
These are the kind who volunteer when it’s not even a holiday.
We don’t even volunteer on a holiday.
What if there was, like, a disaster?
-What, like a dirty bomb? -Whatever.
And there’s a little kid who ends up on our doorstep.
Are we gonna turn her away 'cause we’re not special enough?
That would depend. There’s a lot of factors that go into it.
I mean, our food rations, the blast radius.
El, you can’t take some offhanded remark I made
and turn it into a crazy life decision. It was a joke.
Yeah.
I know. I just...
You’re right. You shouldn’t be pushed into something you don’t want to do. It was just a nice thought.
you don’t want to do. It was just a nice thought.
Good night.
All right, I won’t make any more jokes like that.
All right?
You wanna watch a little Fixer Upper?
-Okay, I love you. -[Ellie] I love you.
[Joanna, on TV] That’s a long fill-up, my friend.
[Chip] That’s because I wanted you to come in here.
We’re having a karate kicking contest. Me versus you...
Oh, God.

[sighs] It’s not fair. That is not...
Hey.
You can’t buy these pita chips anymore. They’re way too spicy.
I’m getting my nose watery and--
Over a half million children are currently in foster care.
The system is overloaded, okay? It doesn’t need any more kids.
For a child to be removed, conditions have to be pretty bleak,
usually involving abuse or extreme neglect.
And some of these kids can often languish in the system,
unless a wonderful family like yours steps up for them.
We’ll step up. We’ll take one right away.
Oh, perfect. Let me check in back, see what we have in stock.
She is kidding, of course. We do not "stock".
And you know that. Um...
But we can take you through the eight-week foster parenting course,
and you can get your certification.
And then we can pair you with some kids that you can foster until they become adoptable.
that you can foster until they become adoptable.
But it is not gonna be easy, folks.
These kids will test your will,
put a strain on your relationship,
and push buttons you didn’t even know you had.
I can tell by looking at you that not all y’all are gonna make it.
[chuckles] I actually think this group has got the grit to face some unpleasant...
-Excuse me. -You guys heading out?
-[man] Yeah. -Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.
-All right, that one’s on me. -It absolutely is.
-We’ve gone over this before. -We have.
-This is a problem. -[Karen] It’s a problem. Okay, everybody, why don’t we learn your names
Okay, everybody, why don’t we learn your names
and what type of children you’re looking for.
Oh, hi, um,
we’re Dana and Dirk McCann.
And the Lord has guided us here to adopt a baby boy... or a girl.
Yeah, the big guy, he’s... -blessed us with so much. -Mm-hmm.
We’d like to share it with a child that needs a home.
-Yeah. -Oh, what about over here?
I’m David, and this is my wife, Jessie.
And we’ve been trying to have a baby for three years now.
But no matter what we do, I can’t...
I’m sorry. Can someone else go?
-It’s okay. -[Kit] It's okay.
Well, I’m Kit and this is Michael.
We’ve also been trying to conceive now.
Pretty much since the first night we met, right?
That is correct. We’re just not having any luck.
Anyway, we’re looking for a child of any gender or ethnicity up to nine years old.
Hello. My name is October Ross Jennings.
And I would like to be the single mother
of an athletically gifted teen boy who I can help
of an athletically gifted teen boy who I can help to reach his full Division One scholarship potential.
Preferably African-American.
-Mm-hmm. -[Ellie laughs] Right? Like The Blind Side. Like the movie. Right?
-That’s great. -Honey, she’s not joking.
Are you jo-- You’re not joking? My God. I’m so sorry. I just thought
My God. I’m so sorry. I just thought 'cause of the gay guys' conceiving joke that we were...
I mean, that is the plot of The Blind Side, so...
I’ve never seen it. So, please, it’s your turn.
Just do not talk to me anymore. [Pete, whispering] Yeah, she’s nuts.
I’m so sorry. I feel terrible. I, uh...
Um, my name’s Ellie. Hi. This is my husband, Pete.
Yeah, I mean, I’m not too sure about any of this.
I mean, I get it. We adopted our dog Meatball. -We love him like crazy, but-- -Don’t compare kids to dogs.
-We love him like crazy, but-- -Don’t compare kids to dogs. No, I’m not. I’m just saying
No, I’m not. I’m just saying there used to be a stigma about getting a dog from the pound,
but now they’re called rescue dogs and everybody wants one.
Don’t say "pound," don’t say "dog." Just don’t.
Okay, no, that’s not...
It’s just all of this is a little bit scary, right?
But maybe if you call them rescue kids...
-Oh, my God. -...instead of foster kids, more people would be into it, and then people
more people would be into it, and then people -wouldn't be walking out-- -Pete! Pete!
-It’d be good for your program. -Pete! Pete!
-I’m just saying-- -Just stop it!
Oh, everyone, our guest speaker of the day, Brenda Fernandez and her parents.
Let’s make them feel welcome.
[Brenda] Hey, thank you.
Hi. [chuckles]
So, when I was eight years old,
my mom and her boyfriend decided it would be a good idea
my mom and her boyfriend decided it would be a good idea to build a meth lab in our garage.
They made me deliver drugs for them.
They abused me physically, and some of their customers abused me sexually.
Uh, when I was 11, our garage exploded,
Uh, when I was 11, our garage exploded, and I was put in the system,
bounced around from placement to placement.
Pretty soon I was 14.
Nobody wants a teenager, so I’d be aging out in a few years.
The thing is, over half the kids who age out of foster care
end up homeless, addicted, incarcerated, or dead within two years.
That was gonna be me, trying to start my adult life,
but with no family to help me pick a college,
nobody to come home to on the holidays or cry to
nobody to come home to on the holidays or cry to when my first boyfriend dumped me for Missy Howard.
But then those two... very special people came along.
And I didn’t make it easy on them.
But no matter how hard I pushed them away,
they were always there with a sack lunch and a ride.
Thanks, you guys.
Come here, Daddy. You too, Mama.
-That was good. -[laughs]
I am so sorry about the Blind Side comment.
I love the movie.
Bye, Brenda. Great job. Amazing. All right, Kit, bye.
Dirk, see you in the classes, buddy. Bye, guys. Hey.
So, now you think we’re special enough? Maybe we are. I mean, this is what we do.
Maybe we are. I mean, this is what we do.
We see potential in things, we fix ’em up. Like they did.
They find this kid in a state of disrepair,
give her a new coat of paint, scrape off her emotional popcorn ceiling,
install countertops in the form of love or self-esteem.
I’m not saying she’s a house the way I said the dog thing in there,
but I think we’re perfect for this.
But she’s really-- she’s not a house, Pete.
I just said she's not a house! Are you listening to me?
[Ellie] Okay. No, I, uh...
I’m so exci-- Are you excited?
I just get worried that you think things
I just get worried that you think things are gonna be easier than they actually are.
-What? I do not. -You do.
This was your idea. Now that I’m pumped about it, you’re not even pumped?
-No, no, I am pumped. -You don’t look pumped.
A life-altering moment like this, you gotta get pumped.
We’re about to do something insane.
-Did you hear her speak? -Yes.
It was the greatest thing I’ve heard in my life. -I know! -Come on, cowgirl,
-I know! -Come on, cowgirl, -let me get a yee-haw. -Yee-haw!
No, bull. Gimme one. Yee-haw! Louder. Crazier.
Come on. Come on!
You’re about to be a mom! -[Ellie] Yaaa-hoo!

Hmm?
The same way you got fired from your last three jobs.
And you might quit just to get some control back.
Hell, you might even tip over that damn yogurt machine

[Sharon] Just to clarify,
Karen is not advocating vandalism in the workplace.
The point is, that it’s the same...
for a displaced child...
...who knows... that you don’t want her.
Except instead of grieving...
the loss of a job...
she’s losing her connection

But the one connection that can remain
is between siblings.
Sometimes it’s easier for sibs to adjust
because they’re not going through it all alone.
You might want to consider upgrading to a sibling set.
[Karen] Dirk? Would you consider siblings?
The big guy might smile on that.

Just sign in, take this form with you and write down the name
Just sign in, take this form with you and write down the name of any kid you meet that you might be interested in.
Really? That’s how this works?
Yeah, it can feel a little like shopping for kids.
It’s messed up, I know, but the county puts these on
because they can match a lot of kids and parents quickly.
God, look at the big kids over there.
Breaks my heart.
Most folks want nothing to do with teenagers.
Of course, if you two thought you could make room for an older child...
-Um, I mean... -I... Oh, God.
I’m so sor-- We-- We’re terrible people.
-I’m sorry. -You’re not terrible.
Now get on in there and find you a family. Go on.
God, it’s so weird. Normally, you wouldn't chat up

Okay.
Never mind. Thanks.

Really. You want to have a go?
Oh.
Nice to meet you.

Yeah-- Whoa! Oh!
Hey. You gotta wait for your turn, buddy.
-I’m sorry. -Let’s... Let’s just go.
Pete. Ellie.
-How’s it going? -Hey.
Yeah, well... it’s a little weird.
Yeah, these things can be kind of awkward.
But did you meet any kids that you’re curious about?
We met one little girl who was sitting all by herself.
Very sweet, a little guarded, had a little wall around her.
Really small for her age too. Maybe a fetal alcohol thing or something.
I saw her-- Oh, right there. The little sad looking one with pigtails who seems like
sad looking one with pigtails who seems like she’s been chained to a radiator half her life.
-Uh, that’s my daughter. -The radiator kid?
[chuckles] What?
Yeah. That’s my daughter.
[Ellie] I’m so sorry.
You don’t have to be sorry. I’m really proud of her.
The reason she’s sitting away from others is because she has a family, a very happy family.
is because she has a family, a very happy family.
And I didn’t drink a drop when I was pregnant.
Nor do I have a radiator.
-You should be really proud. -[Sharon] I am.
I’m sick of looking at that. To hell with it. -I’m going over there. -Pete. Hey, Pete.
-I’m going over there. -Pete. Hey, Pete.
-Pete, what are you doing? -Look at them over there.
Everybody’s avoiding them like they’re dipped in shit. I’m gonna go say hi.

I know. I think it’s awful. But they’re teenagers, okay?

playing video games on YouTube. We’re not equipped for that.
[Pete] What do we have to be equipped for? I’m just saying hello. [Ellie] I don’t think we should do that.
[Ellie] I don’t think we should do that. -Excuse me? Hi. -Hey. Hi.
Hi! Just FYI, we can all hear you.
-Hmm? -"Dipped in shit." "Masturbate," so forth.
Uh, we appreciate the concern, but there’s no need to go all pity crazy.
We know how this works. So, just go on. It’s okay. go mingle with the kiddies and, uh,
It’s okay. go mingle with the kiddies and, uh, don’t give it another thought, okay?
Have a good day, folks. Thanks. Bye-bye.
[Karen] So, you two went out and found yourself a teenager after all, huh?
-We only met her for a second. -But she made a real impression.
[Sharon] Oh, yeah. Lizzy’s such a great kid.
She does really well in school. Come on back.
She came into care four years ago when she was 11.
Took a lot to convince her to accept placement in an adoptive home.
-Her mother-- -Set the house on fire,
passed out with a crack pipe.
-What I was gonna say-- -Before I told it like it is?
Before you jumped on in there,
is that her mother’s made a lot of promises over the years
and never seems to follow through with them.
Where’s her mom now?
Probably in an orange jumpsuit selling smokes in the yard.
[Sharon] I’m sure that’s not accurate.
Huh. Turns out Lizzy’s mom
is finishing a sentence in county jail.
Who called it, huh? Who said it?
-You did. -Yeah.
Looks like she’s never pursued reunification
or contacted her kids in over two years.
So, yeah, she’s pretty much a nonissue.
That’s terrible. What about the father?
What are you talking about, "father"?
What, are you doing comedy for us now, Pete?
Karen, we’ve had plenty of fathers who have stepped up,
but in this case, no IDs on any birth fathers.
Look, Lizzy’s mom is a product of the system
and she never learned to properly care for herself, much less three kids.
-Three kids? -Oh.
-What? -Yeah, three.
-[Karen] Yeah, Lizzy-- -At once?
Yeah, Lizzy comes with two younger siblings,
-Juan and Lita. -[Ellie] Wait, wait.
-So, we'd have three children? -No. Two, maybe,
-So, we'd have three children? -No. Two, maybe, but there’s no way we can do three.
We wanted to meet-- Oh, my gosh.
-Why would you show us that? -You’re an asshole.
Why would you even show that? They’re so cute. That’s wrong.
Listen, we’re not gonna sugarcoat it, okay?
Lita is a wild, rowdy kid,
and Juan can be fragile and a little emotional,
and Lizzy is strong-willed and she won’t trust easily.
-God, can you blame her? -[Karen] Well, but listen,
we wouldn’t recommend this match if we didn’t believe
we wouldn’t recommend this match if we didn’t believe that with some structure and love
these-- these kids could blossom, right?
[Sharon] Yeah. We’re hoping to get them out of their current foster placement.
[scoffs] The Muskies might lose that meal ticket. Karen, please.
Most of our foster parents are really terrific, caring people.
And, yes, there are people who do it just for the paycheck.
But the Muskies are not abusive or evil.
-Just maybe a little-- -Inbred.
-Karen, there is no evidence-- -You’ve seen ’em.
I swear they look like brother and sister. -I can’t tell them apart. -[Sharon] In any case,
-I can’t tell them apart. -[Sharon] In any case, I’d love to set up a visitation,
unless you have any other concerns.
It’s just a visitation. So...
[stammering] It’s just-- Is it a problem, you know, the whole white savior thing?
-Like the Avatar thing. -Avatar?
The blue guys couldn’t fight off the unobtanium guys
until the white guy showed up and pretended to be a blue guy?
I just-- All I’m saying is, white-bread couple taking in little Latin kids.
Are people gonna think we shouldn’t be doing that?
You know what, we’ll toss these kids back into the system
and I’ll just jot you down for "whites only."
-Come on. I didn’t mean-- -Hey! No, that’s not...
Don’t write "whites only."
-That’s not what he meant. -That’s not at all what I meant.
Pete, I appreciate your cultural sensitivity,
but we have every color of kid in the system.
-And every color of parent. -[Karen] Every color.
-Just not nearly enough. -Not nearly enough parents.
-Mm-mm. -And listen.
You’re gonna get some funny looks.
And people are gonna say some stupid shit.
But if you’re willing to love these kids who need a mom and dad,
and somebody has a problem with that,
you just ask ’em how many goddamn kids they’ve adopted.
-Exactly. -Hell.
-Shoot. -All right, well,
-Shoot. -All right, well, I just wanted to have the Avatar talk.
-Now we did, so I’m good. -Oh, fantastic.
-You ready to meet three kids? -Three kids?
-Yeah. -All right. We’ll set it up.
Hey. How’s it going?
Good. It’s going really good. Pete and Ellie.
Yeah, yeah, we know. Come on in.
-[door closes] -Good luck with that one.
She thinks she’s better than everybody.
Yeah. The other two are jackassing around out back.
We’ll be in the shop.
-Hey. -Hi.
-Hey, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner. -[Ellie] How are you?
Oh, uh, Ellie and Pete. You don’t have to call us
Oh, uh, Ellie and Pete. You don’t have to call us -the Wagners. -No, please. Good to...
-Um, sorry about them. They’re-- -Oh, please.
-They just seem a little-- -Like brother and sister?
[Mrs. Muskie] Pipe down with that crap. -We are not friggin’ related. -[Mr. Muskie] Friggin’ related.
-We are not friggin’ related. -[Mr. Muskie] Friggin’ related.
I’m really gonna miss them.
-That is, if you-- -No. Please. Oh, my goodness.
-You made an impression on us. -We're so happy...
We wanted to get to know you a little bit more. -Meet your brother and sister. -They’re actually right outside,
-Meet your brother and sister. -They’re actually right outside, -if you guys wanna follow me. -Yes! Yes.
[Lizzy] Okay.
Juan. Lita.
I want you guys to meet Pete and Ellie.
-Hi. -Hey, guys.
Are we gonna go stay at your house now?
-Um... -Well, we met your sister,
and she’s so awesome.
-She’s really cool. -She told us about you.
Want to play restaurant with me?
Yeah, I would love to. -Where’s your restaurant? -[Lita] Right over there.
-Where’s your restaurant? -[Lita] Right over there. -And what’s your doll’s name? -Her name is Potato Chips.
-And what’s your doll’s name? -Her name is Potato Chips.
-I love potato chips. -Potato chips are my favorite.
Oh, nice one.
-Can we be the Clippers? -I’m more of a Lakers fan.
-Oh, uh, sorry. -No,
you don’t have to say sorry. That’s okay.
-We can be the Clippers, okay? -[Juan] Okay.
-I shoot, you crash the boards. -[Juan] Yeah. Sure.
Oh, no!
Oh, shoot!
-You did it on purpose! -What?
You hit me ’cause I like the Clippers. Buddy, I think the Clippers are awesome.
[Ellie] We love the Clippers. Are you kidding me?
It was smart to get rid of Blake Griffin, great trade.
We’re obsessed with the Clippers. I can’t get enough of them. They’re amazing.
I can’t get enough of them. They’re amazing. [Juan] Okay.
Can we play hide and seek? You sure? You lost a lot of blood.
-I love hide and seek. -But just us. No girls.
Oh. Sure.
It’s not that progressive, but no problem. Lita, should we go play restaurants?
-[Lita] Yeah. -[Juan] You’re it.
-I’ll hide and you count. -You sure you’re okay?
-Yeah. Go on, count to 20. -All right, buddy.
Oh, my God.
You better not embarrass me at the restaurant.
Potato Chips has been bad today. Bad girl!
Bad, bad, bad!
Don’t talk back, you little beaner!
Oh! Uh...
-I don’t think that’s-- -You know what? She picks up that stuff off the TV.
-[Mr. Muskie] Yeah. -Oh, don’t give me the look.
Let’s not call her bad names like that. Don’t tell me how to treat my kid!
You think you’re better than me, huh?
[Ellie] Pete, if you don’t want the kids, I’m not gonna push you into it.
All right, look.
[sighs] I’m gonna be honest with you, all right?
I don’t know, I just thought when we met our kids
that it would be like this cosmic connection.
Like just take one look at them and just know, -like when you and me met. -Yeah. Totally.
-like when you and me met. -Yeah. Totally.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you didn’t just know?
-Hmm? -Oh, my gosh.
-What? -You heard me what I said. -You didn't just know? -No, I was interested,
-You didn't just know? -No, I was interested, but I-- you know, I’m more cautious than you are.
Really? Wow. How long before you just knew?
[scoffs] A couple of months.
A couple of months? How many months?
Like, four...
-Four? -...teen.
-Fourteen? Oh, my God! -[Ellie] Babe, look.
-I knew before we got married. -That’s the point.
We don’t have a year-long engagement on this thing.
If we say "yes," they’re in our house next week.
Did you feel a cosmic connection?
No, I didn’t feel a cosmic connection. I felt like I was... babysitting other people’s kids.
I felt like I was... babysitting other people’s kids.
I agree.
-With what? -With you.
With me wanting the kids or not wanting the kids?
-Whatever you want. -That’s not an answer.
Give me 14 months to think about it. How ’bout that? Come on.
How ’bout that? Come on.
-[door opens] -[woman] Hi!
-[Pete] It’s not a potluck. -[door closes]
All righty.
Honey, put those down for me. Thank you.
All right, come on, everybody.
Honey, come on. [chuckling] Jeez.
All right, everybody, hands.
Hands, hands, hands. Thank you.
Eyes closed.
[sighs] I’m thankful for my beautiful grandchildren,
including the-- the very lucky kids
that are soon to be adopted by two wonderful parents.
I’m really thankful for that too.
That is really inspiring stuff, you guys. Well done.
Yeah, about that. Actually, we--
We’ve decided together not to move forward with the foster thing.
We realized we hadn’t thought it through properly, so...
Yeah! Jesus Christ. This is great news.
We were all being supportive to your faces, but...
Oh, yeah, we all thought you were out of your minds.
I never said anything, but I’m thankful to hear this.
What? Why?
-Let’s not. We’re holding hands. -No, no, no, no. I'd be thankful to know why you all have a problem with this.
I'd be thankful to know why you all have a problem with this.
-I never had a problem with it. -I think it’s kinda smart,

and the hormones and the... the rage. -Stop talking. -[Jan] Ellie,
-Stop talking. -[Jan] Ellie, all I’m saying is that we’re thankful
that you and Peter are gonna experience having the love
that you and Peter are gonna experience having the love of your own beautiful children rather than...
-Than what, Jan? Spit it out. -[Russ] Hell, I’ll say it.
Rather than just rolling the dice
with the offspring of some criminal or drug addict.
To be honest, we were worried about our real kids’ safety...
-What? -...were they to hang out with your kids
-if they’re-- -Damaged goods?
You know, 'cause when I was growing up,
a lot of people thought I was damaged goods too.
Pete, we’re not talking about you, man,
we're talkin' about, you know, crack babies and kids who have been sexually harassed.
"Sexually harassed"? What do you mean?
"Sexually harassed"? What do you mean? Like their parents maybe made lewd comments?
You know what I mean, wiseass.
Open your stupid eyes.
How long have everyone’s eyes been open? Kimmy, you of all people. What if you can’t have a baby?
Kimmy, you of all people. What if you can’t have a baby?
Do not put that out -into the universe. -What if you can’t?
-into the universe. -What if you can’t? -What are you gonna do? -[Linda] My God, Kim,
if you don’t quit being so nuts about this baby thing,
I swear to God, I’m gonna get pregnant again this afternoon
just to spite you.
-And you know I can do it. -Really?
-No. -Oh.
Sorry we’re not as politically correct as you guys,
but our baby has to be our blood.
-[Kim] Yes! Absolutely! -[Ellie] My God! "Our blood"!
-[Kim] Yes! Absolutely! -[Ellie] My God! "Our blood"! -This blood right here? -What’s that supposed to mean?
-This blood right here? -What’s that supposed to mean? Jerry, what do you think of all this?
I’d be thankful if we could eat, Russ.
You just spent 30 minutes talking about the deep state.
You don't have an opinion on your own family?
-None of my business. -[Ellie] Thank you, Daddy.
I'd like you to know thousands of children
are spending Thanksgiving without any family at all.
And right now, I kinda envy them.
But I know you guys love me.
I know that I have a place to go to eat turkey and be thankful.
But a lot of kids don’t have that.
And it’s not their fault! And they’re not damaged goods!
So forget what I said before. It is back on!
-If that’s okay with you, honey. -Yee-haw, baby.
Yee-haw. We’re gonna adopt a whole shitwhack of kids.
I'm thankful that whoever has a problem with it can fuck right off!
-Amen. -Amen.
[Jan] Well, there goes another Thanksgiving.
[Pete, whispering] You’re crazy.
Hi, honey. Here we are.
Come in, look around.
-This is Meatball. -[gasps]
A Christmas tree?
Does that mean Santa comes here?
-Yeah, every year. -Yay!
-So, you guys are rich. -What? Ri-- No. -[laughs] -[Pete] We’re not rich.
-[Ellie] No, no, no. -We’re doing okay.
When we got this house, it was a dump.
We renovate houses. Ellie did all the design work.
Actually, everything is from swap meets and flea markets,
and it’s not that expensive at all.
That’s crystal! -Sorry. Oh, my God. -I’m sorry, I’m sorry.
I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have left this out.
You guys want to see your rooms? Come on. Let’s go check out your room.
-Look! I got a bed and a bunny! -What do you think?
I love the bunny ’cause she has a skirt.
-Whose toys are these? -[Ellie] They’re yours
-to share. -[Pete] Yeah.
[gasps] Lego!
Can I put my bears in there?
-Sure. -Of course.
Wow, you have a lot of teddy bears. These are just court bears.
They get one every time we go to family court.
-[Lita] Can you help me? -[Juan] Yeah.
-[Lita] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! -[Juan] Look at this, Lita.
Lizzy, want me to show you your room?
-Okay. Yeah. -It’s just here.
I’m so sorry you have to carry your stuff in these awful bags.
-If we knew-- -No, no, it’s cool.
Fun fact: That’s actually how you can spot a foster kid.
The kid carrying her whole life in a Hefty bag.
It’s a foster joke.
Well, make yourself at home.
Yeah, this is your place. You can do whatever you want with it.
Do you wanna put posters on the wall, -you wanna paint it... -[Pete] Yeah.
Come on, this is what we do. We can knock that out in 20 minutes.
Run down to the hardware store, pick any color you like.
-[Ellie] Yes! -[Pete] What do you say?
-Any color. -[Pete] Just pick a color.
-[Ellie] What color do you like? -[Pete] Any color you want.
You just pick a color, we're doing it. You’d look great in green.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Wow, uh, it’s, yeah, darkest of the black tones.
-Yeah, that’s what she picked. -Dark Kettle Black, huh?
I like it. It’s really... dope.
-I’ll get dinner started. -Okay.
-She doesn’t like it. -I think she loves it.
Well, you know her better than I do.
-Hey. -Hey, you all done in there?
Oh, yeah. And... she loves it.
Oh, great. I’m so glad she loves her black bedroom.
So, I’m gonna register Juan and Lita at Harding in the morning,
and you can take Lizzy to the high school.
Did you see their shoes? We might want to take them -to the mall tomorrow. -Hey, kids, dinner!
-to the mall tomorrow. -Hey, kids, dinner!
What? That sounds insane coming out of your mouth.
-Do we have kids? -Yeah, three of ’em.
That’s insane! I don’t believe it!
Did you not know that? ’Cause they’re really here.
-Holy shit. Holy shit. -Yeah. Yeah.
-Holy shit. Holy shit. -Yeah. Yeah. -They’re here. -I love you.
-They’re here. -I love you.
-What? -Kiss again! Kiss again!
God. Mm!
Mwah! What about that one? Kiss again!
It’s gonna be long and weird.
-[Pete] How ’bout that? -[Ellie] How ’bout that?
-[Pete] How ’bout that? -[Ellie] How ’bout that? -Come on, giggly. Sit down. -I’m gonna shift the plates.
Great. We have everything. We have burgers and pasta
-and-- -Can we have potato chips?
Let’s get ready for the tub.
Uh, you two, come on. Who wants to...
[Lizzy] Hey!
♪ You better know someone then Find someone of our friends ♪ -That’s not really a bath toy. -[Lita] I don’t want this.
-That’s not really a bath toy. -[Lita] I don’t want this.
-Oh, no! That’s gonna-- -What? Hey! Hey!
I’m gonna get a hamper next time.
Hey, next time...
-You need...? -Lookit!
Oh!
Grab-- Hold it. Keep it over the sink, please.
♪ Whoo-hoo-hoo-ooh ♪ Did you flush, sweetie?
-[Pete] Good night, kiddo. -Good night.
[Lita] Good night!
Should we give them a kiss good night? -I don’t know. -Maybe you should ask,
-I don’t know. -Maybe you should ask, -or should we wait? -Should I ask?
-I’ll ask. -[Lita] You guys -are overthinking this. -Sorry, guys.
-are overthinking this. -Sorry, guys. Sorry. [laughs]
-[Pete] Good night. -[Ellie] Good night.
-[Juan] Good night! -[Lita] Good night!
Should we kiss Lizzy good night?
-[Lizzy] I’m good. Good night. -Oh. Night, kiddo.
All right. Good night.
[Dana] We try so hard to engage with him,
but no matter what we do, Jake just wants to hang out in his room,
talking on his phone, swearing, taking the Lord’s name in vain,
and cranking his explicit music till all hours.
And he got into another fight at school.
Thank heaven he didn’t hurt one of the other kindergartners.
I think maybe it’s okay for a five-year-old to have a cell phone.
for a five-year-old to have a cell phone. -Does he have a lot of contacts? -We tried to take it.
-Does he have a lot of contacts? -We tried to take it. His birth mother gave it to him, so we touch it, and it’s...
His birth mother gave it to him, so we touch it, and it’s...
I’m so sorry. You are so right.
He doesn’t need a phone. [sniffling]
-We’re gonna try again. -[Karen] Definitely try.
Okay. And Pete and Ellie took in three children ten days ago,
one of which is a teenager. Yeah, it’s going pretty good.
I think our kids made us realize just what kind of a rut we were in before.
Well, not really a rut. Just the same old routine, you know?
Work, go to the gym, grabbing dinner, drinks, the movies.
-You know what I mean. -No, we don’t know.
I think she’s just trying to say that we needed a new challenge,
I think she’s just trying to say that we needed a new challenge, you know, maybe something to break up the monotony.
That’s not the only thing they’re gonna break.
I know. It sounds-- I know everyone’s going through tough stuff.
But these kids, I think they're just really good. -We got lucky. -Oh, they got lucky.
-We got lucky. -Oh, they got lucky. Yeah, you hit the jackpot.
-Guys. -[laughter]
Why is this funny?
I think they might be recognizing a little bit of a honeymoon period.
-Yeah. -[Ellie] No, we thought of that.
But it doesn’t feel like a period.
-[laughter] -I mean, it’s not perfect.
Lita won’t eat anything but potato chips.
Yeah, but we got a plan to work on that, too.
I’m not saying we’re perfect parents.
Are you sure?
I think I might be recognizing a little bit of jealousy.
-It’s not a good trait, guys. -[laughter]
[Ellie] Okay, what do we have here?
-Huh? -Christmas!
[Ellie] What is it? It’s a sewing machine! What do you think?
No? She doesn’t like it? Why not?
[Pete] Looks like a robot, buddy! [Juan] Lita, look at this big box!
-Dude, it walks and talks. -This could be my helmet!
-Dude, it walks and talks. -This could be my helmet! -What about the presents? -I would’ve went crazy
-What about the presents? -I would’ve went crazy if I got a robot. I’m playing with that robot.
And this could be the spaceship.
-[Lita] Can I go inside? -Sure.
Hey, guys. Wow, you really like cardboard boxes, huh?
Anybody interested in playing with the giant dollhouse
it took me three hours to assemble?
Did it come in a big box?
Yeah, it did. It came in a big $200 box.
-Let’s go! Let’s go! -[Lita squeals]
Come on. Let’s go get the box.
-[Ellie] Christmas is boxes. -Yes.
[Lita] Yay!
Hey, Lizzy, this one’s for you too.
-Merry Christmas. -Oh.
-Another one. -Yeah.
Thanks. Merry-- Merry Christmas.
I...
You didn’t have to get all this stuff for us.
I know, I know, but we wanted to.
We were excited. Did we go overboard?
No, no, no! Um, I’m sorry.
No, no, no! Um, I’m sorry. I’m happy. I am. I...
It’s nice to see Lita and Juan get presents
that weren’t donated from total strangers, so...
Hey, Lizzy, if you ever want to talk about anything...
I know it’s Christmas time and you may have memories and things.
Oh, no, no, no. I’m-- I’m--
I’m good. I...
You know what, I'm just-- actually-- I haven’t had my morning coffee yet.
So, I’m gonna get that.
-Do you want some coffee? -Sure.
[Pete] We wanna thank the Lord for our first Christmas together
and we wanna give thanks for this lovely meal.
And also this, um,
bounty of super fun cardboard boxes.
-Amen. -[chuckling] Amen.
Okay. Tuck in, everybody.
Where’s my potato chips?
We’re not having chips tonight, munchkin. Sorry.
-I want my chips. -[Lizzy] Lita!
Lizzy. Pete and I worked really hard on this dinner,
and there's lots of yummy food for you to eat.
-No! -Hey, hey, hey.
-Lita! [shouting in Spanish] -Please.
Hey! Lizzy, Lizzy, please! Lizzy, no, okay? I’ve got this.
Why are you yelling at me? I’m trying to help you.
I’m not yelling. I’m sor-- I am. Just then I was.
But it’s-- Look. Lita, don’t do what Lizzy said.
What did you say? Cuatro? "Go to your bedroom"?
No, cuatro means "quart." Like quart of milk.
She said, "You're not gonna have potato chips, but you will drink that milk."
In any case, we have this. It’s fine.
-Okay. Fine. -[Ellie] Okay.
Let’s try some of this meat loaf, okay?
-No! I want my chips! -You’re not having chips!
I don’t think she’s getting on board with the plan, honey.
-I don’t want this! -[Ellie] Hey!
You sure you don’t wanna give her chips?
No, we’re not giving her chips. She's gonna eat--
Lita, stay right there!
Oh, God, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
No, it’s okay. Don’t cry. Relax.
-Watch your feet, okay? -[Ellie] Raised feet!
-[Juan] I didn’t mean to. Sorry. -[Ellie] You give those to me.
-Ow! Ow. -[Pete] Calm down. Don’t cry. -[Lita] I want my chips! -[Pete] Stay there, Juan.
-[Lita] I want my chips! -[Pete] Stay there, Juan.
These are really, really good potatoes.
-[Ellie] Hey! -[Lita screaming]
-[groans] God! -[Ellie] Oh, my God.
-[groans] God! -[Ellie] Oh, my God. -Are you okay? -[Pete] Oh, God. Hold on.
Lita, duck!
-[Ellie] What are you doing? -[Pete] Trying to put it out!
-[Ellie] With ketchup? -Put it out!
-All right. -Lita?
[Pete] Wait, what’s that noise?
Why is she growling?
That wasn’t in the classes. I got nothing for that.
[Pete] She’s got a knife.
-It's just a SpongeBob knife. -It’s still a knife.
[Ellie] Put the knife down, honey.
Put down the weapon, okay?
You guys want me to deal with this, or you still got it?
Yeah, do you wanna let her jump in here now, please?
Okay, okay. Fine. Fine!
Lita. [speaking Spanish]
Gracias.
Ellie, you gotta learn some Spanish.
Why would you give a kid milk in a glass cup?
I’m sorry. I didn’t...
[Lita] Why did she do that? I hate her!
That didn’t take long. They hate us already.
Well, technically, she said she hates you.
-Okay, okay, okay! -I want a Barbie!
[Ellie] No. This isn’t even a real Barbie.
You’ve got a real Barbie at home that Santa gave you a few weeks ago.
Santa got me a fat Barbie! I want a skinny Barbie!
She’s not fat. She’s body positive.
[Pete] If you put the doll back, I’ll get you a giant ice cream sundae.
So, you’re rewarding this behavior?
-What are you thinking? -You handle it.
-Juan, get out of there. Please? -Don’t hit me! -What? I didn't-- -I’m sorry!
-[customers murmuring] -I didn’t hit him, okay? I never have hit him, I would never hit a kid.
-[screaming] I want a Barbie! -[Lizzy] Stop right now,
-[screaming] I want a Barbie! -[Lizzy] Stop right now, or you’re not getting lunch or dinner.
We’re not starving people here. I have this under control.
Yeah, Lizzy, you body-positive whore!
[Ellie] Okay, you’re done. Gimme that. Give it to me. Just give me that now!
Give it to me. Just give me that now!
Oh, yeah? Yeah, it really looks like you’ve got it.
-Scan it! Hurry! -No!
We’re not doing this!
Someone videotaping this? Pete, where are you? Where’s Pete?
Pete, where are you? Where’s Pete?
You’re done. Oh, great. You’re out there? Thank you so much.
Hey, sweetie. I brought the car. Saved you a little walking time.
-[Ellie] We had a front space. -Well, it’s still closer.
Hey, Pete, look at my pretty new doll. Oh, wow. So you caved, huh?
Oh, wow. So you caved, huh? No, I did not cave. I bought it for her.
No, I did not cave. I bought it for her. It was only four bucks. Can we just get out of here,
It was only four bucks. Can we just get out of here, you coward?
Holy shit. There they are.
Hey, Jan, Jerry. They’re here.
Oh, man! Kid dinged a Porsche.
-Dude, what are you doing? -I’m sorry.
[Pete] All right. Just don’t cry, okay?
He’s gonna have to leave a note.
-[Ellie] Hey, hey! Lita! Lita! -Just help get the stuff -out of the back. -[horn honking]
Ellie looks dehydrated. She looks bad.
-We’ve got the pizza! -Juan, whoa, whoa. What are you doing, bud? Oh, sorry! Oh, Christ.
What are you doing, bud? Oh, sorry! Oh, Christ.
-It’s so warm. -Hey, put the pizza down.
-It’s so warm. -Hey, put the pizza down. -You can’t hold it like that. -[Ellie] Hi, Mom.
Hey, Dad.
[gasps] You must be Lizzy.
Yeah, hi. I’m Lizzy. Um, this is, uh, Lita and Juan.
Hello, Lita.
Hello, Juan.
I’m Grammy "Hw-an" and this is Grandpa "Hw-erry."
Mom, can you just talk like a normal person?
I like the way she says her J’s.
-Can you please? -It’s sophisticated.
-[man] Here you go, brother. -Thanks, man.
I can’t get over it. They look just like normal kids.
What did you think they were gonna look like, Russ, huh? -Little pirates? -I don’t know.
-Little pirates? -I don’t know. They’re just so cute.
[Kim] How is the new school?
It’s good. It’s like... It’s, um... It’s school.
-Yeah. -Awesome.
And what’s the, you know, boy situation?
-Anything exciting? -No, no. Hey, leave her alone.
She doesn’t like talking about that kind of stuff,
so just go easy.
What? You don’t.
Actually, there’s this, um, this one guy, Jacob. -Oh! -Yeah?
Wow, that’s a cute name. Jacob. I like-- Like Jake.
No, honey, it’s "Hway-cob." Right? Right? "Hway-cob."
No, no, it’s just Jacob.
-Jacob. -[Lizzy] "Ja."
Ja... cob.
Yeah, and he’s not cute.
He’s more of like an artsy, old soul type.
-Yeah! -Yeah.
You know, I was never into the cute ones either.
Nah. Cute’s overrated.
Right? I didn’t either. I’ve never had a hot boyfriend. -Ever! They're like-- -Shut up!
-Ever! They're like-- -Shut up!
♪ You look like a monkey ♪
♪ And you smell like one too ♪
-Yeah! -[cheering]
Lizzy, can we put the phone away while we’re at the table,
please, like we talked about?
-Lizzy, please. -[Pete] Give her the phone.
Hey, guys, check it out.
-There’s some shit going down. -Lizzy, the phone. -Now. -[sighs]
Is that her real mom? Yeah, that’s a harsh move.
Actually, if you read your foster parent regs,
you know you’re not allowed to take away any of my personal property, so...
[Pete] It’s the look. She's doing the look. Ah, ketchup. I gotta get some ketchup.
[Ellie] Pete, you’d said you’d say something to her -next time she acts all bitchy. -I never said the word "bitchy."
-next time she acts all bitchy. -I never said the word "bitchy." -It was her word, not mine. -I'm always the bad guy
-It was her word, not mine. -I'm always the bad guy because you’re never there.
I'm not gonna apologize for working.
Somebody’s gotta deal with that dump of a house you bought before it bankrupts us.
[Ellie] I bought? You loved it too! And that's not even the point. The point is, when you are there
And that's not even the point. The point is, when you are there you let them get away with murder.
I got on Lizzy last night when she wouldn't help clean up after dinner!
-Perfect parent, huh? -[laughs]
-Is this funny, Kit? -I think we’re all enjoying this
-Is this funny, Kit? -I think we’re all enjoying this -a little bit, Pete. -[laughter]
-[sighs] -Okay.
-I’m sorry. I’m sorry. -[Karen] It’s okay.
I never get tired of watching white people fight.
[chuckles] Nor do I.
But, why don’t you calm down and tell us,
But, why don’t you calm down and tell us, without blaming each other, what the main issues are.
Well, Lita is just constantly--
-I want-- -I don’t want to!
And Juan just doesn’t use his head.
Unlock the window! And if I say anything about any of it--
[whining] I’m so sorry. It’s not my fault.
-Lizzy’s favorite pastime is-- -Just leave me alone!
Thanks for making me late.
You’re an asshole.
God forbid we actually try to parent the little ones.
No, no, no, no, that’s her territory.
Don’t forget when Lizzy was ten
her mother would disappear for weeks at a time,
leaving Lizzy to parent Juan and Lita all by herself.
Yeah, she’s not just gonna step aside and let you two take over.
Are you saying we should let her parent the kids?
Are you paying attention? She’s 15.
Are you paying attention? She’s 15. She’s a terrible parent. She needs to be a kid.
She’s a terrible parent. She needs to be a kid.
Now, you gotta step up and become the parents.
But you just said she won’t let us. -Nope, she won’t. -[Pete] You know, Karen,
-Nope, she won’t. -[Pete] You know, Karen, you’ve been a godsend through most of this,
but you’re just about to piss me off!
Pete, you won’t get anywhere with her until you two get on the same page.
-Right? -That’s right.
And, you know, if she’s hostile with you again,
maybe try using the three R’s.
Okay? Number one: regulate.
"Lizzy, take some deep breaths, count to ten."
Number two: relate.
"I understand that you’re upset. Nobody likes to feel this way."
-[whispers] That’s good. -Number three: reason.
"Lizzy, it’s okay to be angry.
What’s not okay is to threaten to slash our throats
in the middle of the night when we’re asleep."
-Hmm? -What?
-I’m sorry, did I--? -[Dirk] That was actually us.
-Our story. Last session. -Yeah.
The little guy didn’t follow through with it though.
-Well, not yet! -Not yet.
Sorry, but we shouldn’t be laughing.
No, it’s actually important to have a sense of humor about this kind of thing.
You gotta laugh or you’ll never make it through this.
-That is right. -[Karen] Speaking of which,
-That is right. -[Karen] Speaking of which, next up we have October,
who still hasn’t been matched with a child.
Well, there’s some good news.
Ha-ha-ha.
So, together we’re all gonna decide which chore
we’d like to do, and then each week, we’ll mix it up.
-Can I do "Feed Meatball"? -Yes!
[Lita] I want to feed Meatball! You can feed him next week.
Pete, I hope she’s not serious about all this.
It’s not just she, it’s we. And we are. Very serious.
Okay. So you want us to wash your feet too?
-Oh, Lizzy. -This is bullshit!
Lizzy! Hey, hey, wait, wait! Lizzy. Let’s just...
Let’s try something else. Can we just take a moment,
calm down, and take a few breaths?
-Please? -[inhales, exhales]
[Pete] Try it.
Nice! Nice! And we hear you that you are frustrated with the chart.
Well, yeah. Yeah, I’m frustrated.
Yes! And that’s okay to be frustrated! We’re all frustrated.
So, let’s think about next time how we can express ourselves better.
Okay. Okay. Well...
I don’t know, maybe next time you guys...
try and use the three R’s on me,
I could barf all over the ground because it’s so nauseating!
I knew it wasn’t gonna work with her.
Oh, good! You’re home!
Hi!
Mom, I told you to text or call.
You told me to give you a few weeks to settle in.
Well, it’s been a few weeks. I want to meet my new grandkids.
You must be Lizzy. Come here!
-No, she doesn’t like it when-- -Come here!
Oh! I’m your Grandma Sandy.
Anyone ever starts shit with any of you, they have to deal with me. We’re family now,
they have to deal with me. We’re family now, and I got your back forever. You hear me?
-Mom, just take it easy. Please. -Oh, my God!
-Mom, just take it easy. Please. -Oh, my God! Will you look at them!
Juan, Lita, this is Sandy. This is Pete’s mom.
-Hi! -Hi!
I could just eat you two up! And how’s my baby boy?
Oh!
-[clears throat] Hello, dear. -Hi.
Hey, Mom, you gotta give us a few minutes.
We were in the middle of a family meeting here.
Perfect! Because I’m a member of the family.
Grandma Sandy has an announcement to make.
I got the whole family tickets to Six Flags!
-Yay! -Yay!
-[laughs] -What’s Six Flags?
-"What’s Six Flags?" -Mom, that’s such a nice offer.
But things have been a little chaotic around here,
and we need things to be normal.
I’ll tell you what’s not normal, is your kids not knowing what Six Flags is.
Your kids.
Ma, it’s just not a good time, So we’re not doing this, okay?
We’re not doing this, right? We’re on the same page -because of the structure thing? -Yeah, yeah.
-because of the structure thing? -Yeah, yeah.
Honey? Right, El?
-I did not cave. -[Pete] Oh, you caved.
Lizzy gave you the look and you caved.
Maybe I just wanted to be the fun parent for once
-instead of being the bad guy. -I tried being the bad guy,
-you wouldn’t let me. -Okay, fine. I’m sorry. I really am. But look how much fun everybody’s having.
And Lizzy, she’s actually smiling. It’s crazy.
Hey! Did you have fun?
You don’t have to go on the kiddie rides.
I love the big rides. You want to go--
-Hey, Lizzy! -[Lizzy] Hey, what’s up?
-Good to see you! -Good to see you too!
Hey, hey. What’s up?
Uh, Kylie, Savanna, these are my, um...
fosters.
Yeah, yeah. We’re the fosters!
Right, so, I’ll see you guys later, okay?
Actually, we were just gonna go on the water ride.
Let her go with her friends. They don’t wanna be stuck here
Let her go with her friends. They don’t wanna be stuck here with a bunch of old farts like you two.
They want to ride the big stuff and check out the hot boys.
[chuckles] Here’s a hundred. Buy yourselves some souvenirs and junk food.
-Uh-huh. -Thanks, Grandma Sandy! Thanks!
All right, cool.
Uh, okay, I'll meet you guys at the front.
And, what time are we going back to your house?
We’re going back to our house, where we all live, at 7:00!
Okay, I’ll see you then. Bye!
Mom, what are you doing? You can’t-- Oh, no! Little Juanny’s upchucking in the trash bin!
Oh, no! Little Juanny’s upchucking in the trash bin!
You all right, peanut?
Was it all the funnel cakes we ate?
-Oh. Oh, oh. -[Juan groaning]
[Ellie] I know she’s getting these texts. I can see the dots.
[Pete] Maybe she ran off, or something happened to her.
[Ellie] No, she didn’t. She’s just treating us like another set of fosters.
-[laughing, chattering] -[Lizzy] All right.
-[laughing, chattering] -[Lizzy] All right. -Bye. -[car stereo plays loudly]
[Lizzy] Thanks for the ride. I love you!
-I’m the bad guy. Watch this. -Bye.
-Bye! -Hey!
-Where the hell were you? -We went to the movies.
-Where the hell were you? -We went to the movies. And it ran a little bit later. It’s not a big deal.
Really? You couldn’t have taken five seconds to text or call us
and let us know nobody murdered you? Well, guess what? You’re grounded.
Well, guess what? You’re grounded. -I’m grounded? -[Pete] Yeah.
You’re grounded, because I just grounded you.
Before you weren’t grounded, you weren’t anything,
then I said that thing I said, and now you’re grounded!
-We’ve been waiting one hour! -I’m the bad guy. Calm down.
-He's the bad guy. -You’re not going anywhere.
-You’re done! -[Ellie] Done!
-Don’t want to hear it! -You know what?
When I was nine, I lived in a crack house.
So, I’m pretty sure the Multiplex is a comparatively safe environment.
[Sandy] Oh, no. No. You don’t play that trouble pass card with us.
Your butt’s in a sling, missy!
-Oh, Grandma Sandy, I forgot. -What?
I got you, um...
Oh, sweet Jesus.
Will you look at this? I’m gonna wear it every day.
Oh, come here.
You know, this reminds me
of when Pete and his degenerate friends stole a pizza truck.
-She’s good. She’s good. -Oh, God.
Are you two gonna stand there all night, or are we gonna try
Are you two gonna stand there all night, or are we gonna try to get these kids to bed at a decent hour?
[Pete] Remember I told you we weren’t special enough for this? We were doing fine.
we weren’t special enough for this? We were doing fine. -You said that we were in a rut. -Maybe we were spoiled
-You said that we were in a rut. -Maybe we were spoiled and didn’t appreciate the rut. The rut was easy and quiet.
and didn’t appreciate the rut. The rut was easy and quiet. You know, I miss the rut. But you had to be a mommy.
You know, I miss the rut. But you had to be a mommy.
Whose idea was it to go and talk to the teenagers?
We could’ve had a toddler who doesn’t have opinions
-and thong underwear. -What? You pushed us into some next-level shit!
We can’t start turning on each other here.
I think if we just stay calm, and we work together,
we can find a way to get these little assholes out of our house!
-Now we’re talking! -Right?
-Exactly what I was thinking. -Hello!
-I hate them so much. -Me too. They’re the worst.
They’re so ungrateful. We're doing everything for them.
-And they could give two shits. -Right?
But guess what? They’re not adopted yet.
No. No, they’re not.
We could just...
put ’em back.
I mean, yes, we'd look like the worst people in the world,
-but... -[Pete] Yeah, we would. And right now, everybody thinks we’re saints.
I know. I love that part. I do love that part.
I know. I love that part. I do love that part. That’s the only good part.
Just an idea.
What if we say that some relatives came forward?
The courts took ’em. There’s nothing we could do.
Right? We squirt a few tears, we act super devastated.
That’s good. That’s good. That’s very good.
And we get our clean house and date night back.
And everybody feels sorry for us.
-Yes! -Right?
-Get some presents maybe. -[both chuckle]
We’re never gonna do that.
No.
It’s a nice thought, but we’re...
-We’re stuck, aren’t we? -Yeah, we are.
You know, we gotta just accept that we made a terrible mistake
and our life is mostly gonna suck now.
-Good night, honey. -[chuckles]
All right, one nail on each side of the slat.
-Okay. -On both ends. Okay?
-"Look." -Yes, excellent.
Okay, keep going. Get the words for me.
What are you doing? You wanna get in? You wanna say hi to Lizzy?
Speak of the devil.
-[picking on strings] -What are they doing here?
You never said I couldn’t have any people over.
Everybody knows you can’t have people over when you’re grounded.
And you know that too, because they obviously came in through the window.
This place is disgusting, by the way.
God, what a Nazi bitch. -What did you call me? -I don’t know. You just seem
-What did you call me? -I don’t know. You just seem -like a Nazi bitch. -Get out. Now.
-like a Nazi bitch. -Get out. Now.
Out. Both of you, out. Go! Now! No, you get out of my room.
No, no. I'm staying in your black room. These guys are leaving.
No, out the window, Pussy Riot! Way you came in!
-Out, now! -Holy shit!
Out! Out!
-Oh! -[Lizzy] You’re literally crazy! [Ellie] You’re driving me crazy!
[Lizzy] God. What are you doing?
[Ellie] You're acting like a psychopath. Start the car!
-What is going on in there? -Lizzy, I said you’re grounded.
-Where are you going? -I’m calling my caseworker.
Oh! That’s a good idea, huh? Get CPS to come
Oh! That’s a good idea, huh? Get CPS to come make your little brother and sister pack up
their court bears and trash bags in the middle of the night and move them back to the Muskies?
That’ll be really good for them. -Better than you. -No! Not better than me!
-Better than you. -No! Not better than me!
I just can’t with you. Can you please deal with her, Pete?
Hey, Lizzy, you’re gonna have to start-- We’re good people! We just wanna make a nice home for you.
We’re good people! We just wanna make a nice home for you. -Is that so wrong? -You’re just another white lady
-Is that so wrong? -You’re just another white lady who wants to adopt little charity orphans
to feel good about yourself.
Pete, you tell her what my nationality is!
Well, actually. by blood, she is one eighth--
Yeah, I’m one-eighth Comanche, okay? So I’m not that white!
And do I look like I feel good about myself right now?
Okay, then tell me! Please tell me!
Why did you suddenly feel the urge to get foster kids?
Because we... It was... I mean, I...
-"Pete, please?" Exactly. -No, I...
Hey, you’re not going anywhere. Stop right there!
Hey, you’re not going anywhere. Stop right there! I mean it. Don’t open that door.
Hey! Do not get in that car. You hear me?
Don’t shut that door. I mean it!
Good. Now, can we just go inside so we can talk about this?
Juan, drop it right now!
[Pete] All right, let go. Let go a sec. What are you doing? Take it out!
No, it's better to leave it in till we get to the hospital.
No, it's better to leave it in till we get to the hospital. You’re okay, buddy. We’re here.
We’re here. You’re okay.
Stay still. I got to wrap it up.
[Ellie] Relax. We’re gonna get you there in one second, okay?
Oh, honey! Juan is gonna be okay. -Come on, come on! -[Juan crying]
Tell the girls we need their car. Now!
Get out! Move your ass! Come on!
-I got you, buddy. I got you. -[Lizzy] Get in. Get in.
[Ellie] Seat belts on, everybody! Seat belts on.
You’re a brave boy, you hear me? Look at me. You’re so brave.
You’re doing such a good job, buddy. We’re right here.
Hello! Hey, help, please.
-What happened? -He’s got a nail in his foot.
-I didn’t want to take it out. -This way.
That was very smart. Put him right on this gurney.
-Hey, buddy. -It’s all right, we’re here.
-Are you the mother? -Yes. Oh, I’m his foster mom.
-Okay. -Right this way, Dad. Hey, buddy, what’s your name?
[doctor] We’ll clean this off, give you a little anesthetic,
and then take this nail out.
Hold my hand. It's just gonna be a little pinch. Look at me.
-Hold my hand, hold my hand. -[doctor] A bit of a sting.
-[Juan] Stop! Stop! -[Pete] It’s almost over.
-[Juan] Stop! Stop! -[Pete] It’s almost over. -[doctor] That’s it. -[Pete] It’s done! It’s done.
-[doctor] That’s it. -[Pete] It’s done! It’s done.
-[Lita crying] -I think you should take Lita to the lobby.
You wanna go with her or stay here with Juan?
-[crying] -Take her, take her, take her.
[Ellie] You're okay.
-[Pete] Come here. -Hey, I’m right here.
He's okay.
You’re so brave.
You’re doing so good, buddy.
So, he doesn’t have to wear a cast or anything?
-It’s just stitches? -Yeah.
-Well, that’s good news. -Yeah.
And, um, how did this happen?
It was my fault. I walked away, and I left the gun there.
It was my fault. I walked away, and I left the gun there. -Juan just picked it up. -No. It wasn’t their fault.
-Juan just picked it up. -No. It wasn’t their fault. It was mine. I was trying to leave in a car
It was mine. I was trying to leave in a car and I wasn’t supposed to, and then-- and then
and I wasn’t supposed to, and then-- and then they got distracted, then I yelled at Juan, and he
-dropped the thing on his foot-- -Sweetie, don’t be ridiculous.
-dropped the thing on his foot-- -Sweetie, don’t be ridiculous. I shouldn't have left the nail gun there.
Pete, shut up! This is the kind of stuff they move kids for.
Look, it wasn’t their fault. They didn’t do anything.
It's my fault. I should be the one -getting in trouble right now. -It’s okay.
-getting in trouble right now. -It’s okay. Why don't you uh, why don't you come on over here.
Excuse me.
And, uh, let’s talk about what happened.
[mouthing] Oh, my God!
So, uh, nobody’s being moved.
-Hey. What’s wrong? -Uh, I have no idea.
-Hey. What’s wrong? -Uh, I have no idea. I just woke up this morning and...
Damn it. [laughs]
[Ellie] You know what? I think I can help.
I have, uh...
this really great detangler. You want me to...?
-Sure, yeah. Whatever, yeah. -Yeah?
Okay, here.
Have a seat...
and I’ll, uh... Yeah. -Okay. -[chuckles]
-Wow. How’d this happen? -I don’t know.
Yeah. Just let me know if it pulls, okay?
Okay. That’s good.
-Better, yeah? -Oh, wow. Yeah. Thank you.
Let me just smooth it out for you.
Thank you.
No problem. It’s all gone.
-[Ellie] You all set? -[Lizzy] Yep.
-Hey, thanks for the lunch. -No problem.
Oh, is that that boy Jacob?
The one that just picked up that bit of trash?
Don’t freak out about it. No! Why would I freak out about it?
He looks like an artistic type, like you said.
-You think so? -Definitely!
-Look at that face. -[Lizzy] Yeah.
Conscientious. Picking up trash.
Yeah. Yeah, he is. Yeah.
-Well, have a good day. -Thanks. You too.
-Well, have a good day. -Thanks. You too. -Okay. -All right.
-Okay. -All right.
Careful with your foot, Juan. Bye, Lita.
Well, did you see that?
Definitely starting to hate me a bit less, right?
Maybe.
-Hi, Lizzy. -Hey, Charlie.
Hi, Jacob.
-Wassup, baby girl? -Nothing.
-Wassup, baby girl? -Nothing. -How you doing? -Good. Cleaning up your mess.
-How you doing? -Good. Cleaning up your mess.
Why don’t you get into school before you get me in trouble.
All right, fine.
-Text me. -Okay.
-Hey, hon. -Hey.
-Hi. How’s she doing? -She’s good.
Oh. Yeah. And check this out. I got here early, and Lizzy saw me, and she came over
and Lizzy saw me, and she came over and just starts talking.
-To you? -Yeah! Not full-on girl talk,
-To you? -Yeah! Not full-on girl talk, but not the usual silent treatment either.
She was telling me about that kid Jacob,
and how he doesn’t say much so she can’t tell if he likes her.
Next thing I know I’m in full mom mode, giving her advice, like,
"Well, you know, sometimes, with the quiet types, maybe you'll have to make the first move."
What, you said "make a move"? You told her to make a move? On a boy?
This kid is harmless, baby. Trust me.
I’m thrilled she even likes him. I totally pegged her for the bad boys.
-[Lita crying] -What happened? -Juan broke Potato Chips. -[Pete] Calm down.
I’m gonna fix her, okay? Here you go. See?
Thanks, Daddy.
Did you hear that? I just got my first "Daddy"!
That’s... You suck!
No fair! I want some of that. Hey, honey.
Lita, can I help you with anything? -Nope! -No, what?
-Nope! -No, what? Are you talking to me? Who am I?
Are you talking to me? Who am I?
-Ellie. -Juan. Buddy, come here!
Come here, son.
How’s your foot? You okay? You okay if I call you "son"?
-Sure. -[sighs]
-Where’s Lizzy? -Right there. You see her?
[Juan] Oh, yeah, she's right there.
She comes out here, she takes all this stuff out,
and she can’t bother with the one second it takes
to close a stupid door, or put anything in the sink.
-What happened? -I found my hairbrush
-What happened? -I found my hairbrush -in the toilet this morning. -What?
-I told you that wasn’t me! -Of course it was you.
-I told you that wasn’t me! -Of course it was you. I left it in the bathroom for you.
Juan and Lita aren’t even up yet.
-I’m up now, Miss Noisy Pants. -I’m sorry, sweetie.
I thought we were connecting. I left it there for her
I thought we were connecting. I left it there for her with a nice little note, with hearts on it.
-[Pete] Oh, my God. -I didn’t do it.
-Wow. Hello. -What is that?
You’re wearing that? Are you going to a strip club?
Sorry I don’t dress like an uptight douche like you.
-[Ellie] Hey! -No, no, no. You don't talk
-to my wife like that! -It's from Ann Taylor! Loft!
[Pete] You know what, go put some clothes on, a lot of them. Then get in my truck.
a lot of them. Then get in my truck. -I’m driving you this morning. -Oh, my God!
-I’m driving you this morning. -Oh, my God! You guys are so annoying!
Change the clothes. [Lizzy] It’s not that big of a deal.
-Hey. -Do I dress like a douche?
No. Make sure she gets out to my truck.
-Bye, Daddy. -[Pete] Bye, sweetie.
[gasps] Oh!
Oh, my goodness. Oh.
-Hey, what’s that? Oh! -[glass cracks]
Ow! [groans]
You okay? That’s a shame.
-What are we doing here? -Let’s go.
I’m gonna be late for school, you know.
Come on.
Okay. So, you’re punishing me with manual labor.
You know, I’ve worked harder than you've-- Yeah, yeah, I know, you’re a badass.
This isn’t a punishment, okay?
Hey! I’m Stewart. You probably...
-You... What’s up? -Stewart.
-You... What’s up? -Stewart. Don’t ever talk to her again, okay?
As a matter of fact, go to lunch. It’s 8:15.
Okay. Lunch it is.
Come on.
-Put these on. -What?
Just put them on.
Lizzy, I know you’re angry.
At us, at the world. Maybe at yourself a little bit.
I don’t know, and you’re not talking.
Truth is, when I’m pissed, I don’t much like to talk about it either.
But you know what I do like to do?
-[Lizzy gasps] -I like to break shit.
Really?
Anything in this room.
-Swing away. -[Lizzy] Okay.
-[Pete] Huh? How’d that feel? -It felt good!
-Feels good, huh? I told you. -Yeah.
Now-- Whoa, whoa!
Don’t waste it, all right? I want you to do me a favor.
I need you to think about something that really pisses you off.
-You got it? -Yeah, I got it.
-Are you sure? -Yeah, I got it.
Right, let’s see it. Bust that shit up.
Yes!
-There you go. You like that? -Yeah, that was good.
All right, come on.
Yeah! [laughs]
-Whoo! -There we go. Yes!
Ho-ho! Double shot!
You like that?
-[Lizzy sighs] -That was cool.
-So, no school today, huh? -[Lizzy] Pete took me
-to the house you’re flipping. -Hmm.
-We did some demo work. -That’s cool.
Um, hey, hey, come on.
About that hairbrush?
my mom used to... brush my hair...
and, um... I don’t know, I’m sorry.
It’s okay. I’m sorry too.
[Lizzy] No, you have no reason -to be sorry. -No, I’m really sorry.
-All right. -[laughs]
-I’m gonna go clean up. -Hairbrush is in the toilet,
-I’m gonna go clean up. -Hairbrush is in the toilet, -if you need it. -[laughing] Good one.
-if you need it. -[laughing] Good one.
[chuckles] Thank you.
You wanna rotate like this, okay?
Yeah.
[Lita] Juan hit me!
Oh, no. Oh, Gosh!
Hey, number three, where’s your mother?
I’m okay. Okay.
I didn’t hit her!
[Lizzy] Juan, where did you put my phone? I didn’t take your phone! No, I didn’t!
♪ Tell me who am I ♪ ♪ Without you ♪
-All right! First try! -[laughing]
-[Lizzy] Tres. -[Pete] Tres.
-There you go. -Dad, Dad, Dad!
There you go, Juan.
-Oh! [gasping] -Oh, gosh.
Spit it out, spit it out!
-[Ellie] Here, water! -No, we need ice!
-Water, water. Here. -[Ellie] Oh, gosh.
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
-Hey, hey, hey. -[gasping]
Hey. It’s okay, sweetie. Did you have a bad dream?
-Yeah. -Yeah?
You’re okay. You’re safe and sound in your bed.
You’re good.
Good night, buddy.
Good night, Mommy.
What?
What did you say?
Juan, what did you say?
Did you say something, Juan?
Hey, Juan, what did you say?
Juan!
Juan! Did you say something? Juan!
Juan, what did you say?
Juan!
Oh, my God. [chuckles]
Good night, buddy.
-Hey. -Hey!
-Wow, it’s looking good. -Huh? You like it?
I put the storage at the end of the island, like you suggested.
-Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah. -[Pete] Great idea, by the way.
-Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah. -[Pete] Great idea, by the way. -It’s awesome. -Why don't you come help us
-It’s awesome. -Why don't you come help us -hang some tile? -Yeah.
[chuckles] No, I, uh...
So, there’s, um...
There’s something I’d like to do, and I was hoping I could get your help setting it up.
-Sure. What are we setting up? -Of course. Anything.
Um, so, I was talking to Karen and Sharon, and they...
Uh, my mom got out a few-- a few months ago, so...
And I haven’t seen her.
You know, I was hoping I could-- could see her.
-Yeah, sure. -Yeah, of course.
-Of course. I mean, that’s... -Yeah.
Cool. Thanks.
-Yeah. -It’s cool. Great.
-Okay. -[Lizzy] Thanks.
You, uh...
I’ll just wait outside. Okay.
Mom!
Hi.
-Hi, Mom. -[speaking Spanish]
Juan, Lita.
[Lizzy] Hey, Juan, Lita, come on!
Come on. What’s wrong? Come on.
I want to stay with Mom.
Your mommy’s over there.
-[Pete] It’s okay, sweetheart. -[Ellie] It’s okay, honey.
-[Pete] We’re gonna go with you. -[Ellie] We’re right here.
-We’ll walk together. -Come on.
Slow down.
[Carla] Oh, my babies, you got so big!
Come, mi amor. [speaking Spanish]
Hi, I’m Sue. I’m Carla’s caseworker.
-You must be Pete and Ellie? -Yeah, I’m Pete. Hi.
Hey. I’m Ellie.
-This is Carla. She’s-- -Their mom.
Hi. I’m Ellie. Nice to meet you.
I’m Pete.
Hey, I wanted to say thank you for watching them while I was...
No problem. They’ve been doing great.
Juan started playing piano. Right, buddy?
And Lita just got 100 on her last spelling test.
And Lizzy’s soccer team is undefeated.
All right, so you guys gonna pick us up at 4:00?
Okay. We’ll see you in a bit.
-Yeah, we’ll be back. -We’ll be back soon.
Bye, guys. Nice to meet you.
You okay?
"Thanks for watching them"?
Like we’ve just been fricking babysitting for five months?
[Ellie] She’s just not what I pictured at all.
She’s... She kind of looks normal.
I feel bad, like we’re breaking up a family.
We didn’t take her kids, Ellie.
The courts did. And don’t forget why.
Those kids were living like feral cats in a crack house.
I know, but she kind of... She looks okay.
Sharon said she’s been clean for four months.
Yeah, she got clean because she was in jail, Ellie.
Look at the way Lizzy’s looking at her.
She’s still her mom.
-[engine starts] -We didn’t take her kids, Ellie.
[Kit] So, I said, "Young lady,
we hear about you throwing food in the cafeteria one more time,
and you’re gonna have a couple of lunch dates."
Next day, the behavior continued.
So, we went to the school and joined her in the cafeteria.
Chattin’ up all her middle school BFFs.
I walked them through some of my bird-watching stories.
They were completely uninterested.
But that food throwing has stopped!
-Yeah! -[Karen] Good. Good.
Would you like to share your news?
About the couch fire?
No. About your .26 hearing.
[Kit] Yes.
The court has legally cleared us...
to adopt.
[Kit] To adopt Tina and Ryan!
-[Dana] Yay! -That is so great.
[Dirk] Congratulations, guys. I’m so happy for you.
That is such great news. I’m so happy for both of you.
And next we have Pete and Ellie.
Well, you know, our kids have, what,
Well, you know, our kids have, what, had now four visits with their birth mom?
-[Ellie] Yeah. -[Pete] And every time they do,
they’re just crazy for a few days after.
-[Lita screeching] -Holy sh--
And just when things finally start to feel normal again, they have another visit.
start to feel normal again, they have another visit.
Yeah, we just feel so rejected.
And I know this probably makes me a really bad person,
but I keep wishing their mom would go back to prison.
[Karen] You’re not a bad person.
When someone does terrible things to the children we love,
it’s not easy to find empathy for them.
-But we have to try, people. -[Sharon] Whatever happens,
the time that your kids spent with you made a big difference
the time that your kids spent with you made a big difference -in their lives. -Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I know, but we’re supposed to...
Wait. Did you say
-"made" a difference? -Yeah, she did.
-We-- We’ll talk after. -No. She said "made."
-We-- We’ll talk after. -No. She said "made." That's past tense. There’s a difference.
I wanna know what’s going on, Karen.
Well...
since Lizzy’s mom has been keeping up with her reunification steps...
the judge changed your .26 hearing to a Change of Circumstances hearing where he’ll decide
to a Change of Circumstances hearing where he’ll decide if the kids are ready to reunite.
Nice. Really nice.
No, this is...
You weren’t gonna share that with us?
We’ve been dealing with all of this shit!
I mean, the tantrums, the messes, the attitude.
I have played 150 games of Candy Land with Lita.
You ever play fricking Candy Land?
-It’s brutal! -It’s very dull.
We’re making connections.
Okay, I mean, I just taught Lita how to ride a bike.
Juan and I bonded over Rocky III.
And now Mom’s ready to reunite?
Pete, Ellie, I understand your frustration.
But we all need to keep in mind that until the kids are adopted,
the primary goal of the system is family preservation.
What about preserving our family?
-Yeah. -Nothing has been decided yet.
All right, October, that leaves you.
Well, I have gotten a placement.
He is 14 and does play JV basketball.
But he is 5’2."
And white, with red hair.
Absolutely no fundamentals whatsoever.
Oh, I get it. My problems seem stupid now.
Why do I always have to go last?
-Stop. -Okay. I know.
It’s... [clears throat] It’s very unprofessional. Mm-hmm.
This is the opposite of a support group.
[Jan] What am I gonna look like?
You're gonna look like a beautiful princess. -[Jan] Oh! -[door opens]
[Jan] Do I look like a flower?
Hey. Hey, hey, buddy.
-[Ellie] Mom. Hey, kids. -Oh! Hi, honey!
Hey. Mom!
Hey. Mom! No, no, no. It’s totally washable.
-It’s, um-- -That’s a Sharpie.
Oh, yeah. Oh, dear.
Mom. Can you please get off the counter, honey?
Mom. Can you please get off the counter, honey? It’s dangerous.
-How was care group? -Oh, so much fun.
Hey, hey, hey. We have news.
-You’re pregnant? -Oh, my God!
-Why are you doing this to me? -I’m sorry. No?
It’s okay. No. Just tell them.
-Yeah? -Uh-huh.
Okay, okay. We are going to adopt through foster care, just like you guys!
I mean, we did not get it at first,
and then we met yours and saw what a wonderful choice it was.
Hell of a lot cheaper than in vitro too.
Which is not the reason, but it’s a reason, if you’re weighing factors.
And, uh, we start classes next week!
[Kim laughs] What do you guys think?
[forced laugh] I think, uh...
I think I have to take a crap.
Not the reaction we were looking for on that.
[Kim] She’s jealous!
-[Lizzy] Oh! Hey! -[Ellie] What are you doing?
-[Lizzy] Oh, my God! -What’s going on?
-[Ellie] Give this to me. -[Lizzy] You’re not allowed
-to take my phone! -What’s she doing?
She’s taking naked selfies in the bathroom!
She's taking naked selfies? Of herself? [Lizzy] What are you doing to my phone?
[Lizzy] What are you doing to my phone? I’m deleting everything here! Delete, delete, delete.
How many photos did you take? What is wrong with you?
[Lizzy] Everyone does it! It’s no big deal!
It’s a big, huge, giant deal! Fifteen-year-old girls
It’s a big, huge, giant deal! Fifteen-year-old girls -should never be naked, ever! -Can you take the door?
-should never be naked, ever! -Can you take the door? -[cell phone chimes] -[Lizzy] Is that a text? Don’t read my texts! Open the door!
"If you don’t show me something soon, I might lose interest."
What? -Who is this person, Lizzy? -[Lizzy] Open the door!
Oh, no. No, no. Dick pic! There’s a dick pic!
Come on, kids, we are going in the living room.
Is this that kid Jacob you were talking about?
That sweet kid from school is sending you photos of his beeswax?
-Jesus, that is a trout! -Get out of here!
-[Ellie] Lizzy! -[Pete] Get out here now!
Give me the phone! Let go!
This is not cool, Lizzy!
I don’t have to listen to you anymore, Pretend Mom!
-This isn’t-- -[door slams shut]
Still think it’s a wonderful choice?
Our foster kids aren't gonna act like that. -That’s on you guys. -[blows raspberry]
What exactly is a dick pic?
What do you think it is, Mom? Wild guess. Dick. Pic.
You know, honey, when I had... times like this,
I had to search myself
and remember...
why I became a mother in the first place.
And that was helpful.
[Ellie] Is this that kid Jacob’s house? Is that where we’re going?
-[Pete] Just calm down, okay? -Please tell me where we are.
-I don't wanna get arrested. -Will you just trust me?
Come on.
Oh.
Hey. I don’t know if you guys remember us. Pete and Ellie from the foster orientation?
-Oh, yeah. -Hi. How you doing?
Uh, what can we do for you?
[Pete] So, now she wants to come back and be Mommy again.
And it looks like she’s got a real shot.
Lizzy, she’s treating us like we’re the enemy.
So, now we don’t know what the hell to do.
So, I just thought... I mean, your daughter, she turned out so great.
Is she up there studying? Brenda, you gonna come down?
And I thought maybe we could speak with her, and she could, I don't know, get us pumped up again like she did before.
-Is that a possibility? -Yeah, that’d be great. She was amazing. We could use a pep talk right now.
She was amazing. We could use a pep talk right now.
Um, Brenda is, um...
back in rehab.
Excuse me, what?
We caught her using a couple months ago.
Are you shitting me right now?
Her inspirational, heartwarming goddamn speech is the reason
Her inspirational, heartwarming goddamn speech is the reason we signed up for this shit-show in the first place!
Now you’re telling me she’s back on-- Ow!
You listen to me, crazy woman!
Brenda has struggled with substance abuse
ever since her mother’s boyfriend started her on meth when she was 11.
Sometimes she stumbles. But she is a good kid.
And she’s in there doing the work, getting herself clean.
So, you don’t know what’s gonna happen.
And this has you feeling what?
Frustrated? Scared? Lost? Is that it?
Yes! I’m a little afraid to say anything, but yes, that’s basically how we feel.
That’s how your children feel every day of their lives.
When you took this on, you felt good about yourself
When you took this on, you felt good about yourself because you knew that it mattered, right?
Well, guess what.
Things that matter are hard.
Now I know where Brenda gets her inspiring speech thing.
[Mr. Fernandez] Listen, guys, right now, you’re all they’ve got,
so your job is to keep them safe,
whether they want you to or not.
Wow. He’s got it too.
[Ellie] Thank you so much.
That was incredible. Thank you.
I’m so sorry that I blew up at you.
[Mrs. Fernandez] I’m sorry I slapped you!
-I know! That was crazy! -I know. I apologize.
It was good. I needed it.
I haven’t been slapped for a long time.
It was a bit aggressive, a little bit out of line.
Well, you were, honey. You were.
All right, honey, we gotta go.
-We gotta get going. -Take care.
-Thank you. -You bet.
You’re on Facebook, right? I’ll find you. Okay!
Bye! Bye! Thank you!
Bye.
Let’s get in the house right away, really quick.
-[Ellie] Okay, you’re all set. -Bye, Lizzy.
Bye, Lizzy. Have a great day.
[Pete] All right, look, you drop them off.
I’m gonna find this Jacob kid, and get to the bottom of this.
-Okay? All right. -[Ellie] Okay.
-Wait, Pete, that’s him! -What?
Him? That redhead kid right there? The kid with the soup can...?
Come on. I’m getting him.
You! Dick pic! Hey! Hey!
-Hey! Excuse me. -What’s up, man?
-Hey! Excuse me. -What’s up, man? Wanted to catch a fade, huh?
-Dick pic! -[Pete] Think it’s okay, huh?
-Dick pic! -[Pete] Think it’s okay, huh? Sending pictures of your knob to a 15-year-old girl?
You’re lucky I don’t end your life right now, carrot top.
And I saw what you wrote to her: "You don’t show something,
I’m gonna lose interest." That’s actually sexual assault,
I’m gonna lose interest." That’s actually sexual assault, -young man. It’s disgusting! -[whimpering]
[imitates crying] Not such a big man now, huh? Come on, whip it out! Show everybody
Come on, whip it out! Show everybody those big shaved plums you’re so proud of!
We’ll gonna call your mom, we're gonna tell the principal, and we may even call the police. What do you think, Jacob?
and we may even call the police. What do you think, Jacob? -My name’s not Jacob!
-What? -My name is Charlie.
[boy] That’s Charlie.
-I thought you said Jacob. -Really?
And my plums aren’t shaved.
-[laughter] -Or big.
I’m so sorry. Oh, God. I’m so sorry.
Come on, buddy, suck it up. It’s a little snafu, okay?
Come on. Give me a hug, Charlie.
Look at me. Do you happen to know anybody named Jacob
who might be hanging around with our daughter, Lizzy Viara?
The janitor? The adult-ass janitor?
-Oh, my God. -Come on, let’s get the janitor.
-I’m so sorry about this. -Ellie, come on!
Thank you so much! He didn’t do any of that.
-[Pete] Come on, Ellie. -He didn’t do any of it!
-[Pete] Hurry up! -I’m so sorry, Charlie!
I think we’re gonna be late for school.
Ellie.
He’s on a Zamboni. Come on!
Hey! Hey, you!
Excuse me. I’m talking to you.
-How old are you, Jump Street? -Why d'you wanna know?
-Hey, lady, gimme that. -He’s 22! He’s 22.
Yeah, I’m 22. So what? So, this won’t be child abuse. Pete!
Hey, you ever touch, text, or think about our daughter ever again,
and you’re a dead man.
I’m gonna sue you! You’re not even her parents!
-Would not-her-parents do this? -[groans]
Sh-- Miss Peppers!
Whoa. Whoa. What’s happening here?
This man has been sending lewd comments and photos
-to our daughter. -You’re going to jail today!
-You mind calling the police? -Hurry up!
Absolutely! Miss Peppers!
-Mother-- -[grunts]
All right. We appreciate it.
Man, I didn’t even touch that girl.
-Bye-bye, scumbag. -Filthy pedophile.
Yeah. Enjoy your life as a sex offender.
-Pedophile. -You’re arresting us?
-Pedophile. -You’re arresting us? The guy was sending pictures of his knob to a minor.
-Why are you arresting us? -Really good. Good work, guys.
You know, for what it’s worth, I heard what you did in there.
You know, you’re good parents, looking out for your kids.
-If I’d had a chance... -The kids! -...to do the same-- -Oh, my God!
-Juan, Lita! God, I’m so sorry! -Guys!
-[barking] -Hey. Hey, baby.
My God, it’s so clean.
Well, there are my little gangsters.
Posting bail for my Petey.
Really took me back to the good old days.
-Thank you, by the way. -Where are the kids?
Karen took them to a temporary placement for the night.
She said it’s the first time she’s heard of CPS
removing kids from their adoptive home -the night before their hearing. -Speaking of which,
-the night before their hearing. -Speaking of which,
I found your statement to the judge on your printer.
Needs some work.
Mom, it’s too late. We submitted it last week.
Well, resubmit it! Jesus!
"We want whatever is best for the kids,
whether that means staying with us or returning to their birth mother."
What if the judge reads that crap in front of Lizzy?
That’s why we wrote it like that.
If she thinks our statement is the reason her mom doesn’t get custody,
she’s gonna hate us more than she does now.
She doesn’t hate you. She just thinks you don’t love her.
And that statement ain’t gonna help.
-Did Lizzy tell you that? -Oh, come on, Ellie.
-Did Lizzy tell you that? -Oh, come on, Ellie. I grew up a lot like that kid.
You get reminded what a sack of shit you are five times a day, after a while,
five times a day, after a while,
you can’t believe anyone could ever love you.
You know that we love you, right?
No. But that’s not you, it’s me.
I thought I just covered all that.
But I do love you both.
Get some sleep, kids.
After you fix that god-awful statement.
Wow.
It’s so clean and quiet in here.
I know.
I hate it.
-Me too. -[thunder rumbling]
-[Pete] Hey. -Hey.
-Guys. -We are so sorry.
We are so sorry. Are you okay?
Guess what? We got a ride in a police car.
-You did? Was that fun? -[Juan] Yeah.
-Did you guys go to prison? -No. We were... just in jail.
Juan. Lita. Come on.
-Mom’s here. -[Lita] Okay.
Okay, folks, our .26 hearing is now a Change of Circumstance hearing
is now a Change of Circumstance hearing for a Miss Carla Viara.
-And you are Miss Viara, yes? -She is, Your Honor.
And also with us today are Juan, Lita and Elizabeth Viara?
-Here. -Here!
And did you two each get a teddy bear?
-Yes! -Oh, those are good ones.
-And you are Elizabeth? -It’s Lizzy, sir.
I mean, Your Honor.
And, Lizzy, I understand you’ve submitted a statement.
And the foster parents, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner,
are they present as well?
Yes, Your Honor.
And, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner, is it accurate
And, Mr. and Mrs. Wagner, is it accurate that you left Juan and Lita alone in your car
while you were being arrested for aggravated assault?
-Well, that-- -Yes, but in our defense--
Sir, all I need to know is whether or not Lizzy is lying.
No, she’s not lying.
And prior to that assault, did you accost a 14-year-old
And prior to that assault, did you accost a 14-year-old honor student in the same school yard
and encourage him "to whip out his big, shaved plums"?
I said that, Your Honor, but again,
I said that, Your Honor, but again, I thought it was the person who sent her the--
I thought it was the person who sent her the-- Mrs. Wagner, did you at one time force Lizzy’s friends to leave your home by way of a bedroom window?
to leave your home by way of a bedroom window?
-It was a ground floor window. -Good. Points for you.
And at that same occasion,
did you tell Lizzy to call CPS and to come and take the kids?
-She didn’t mean that. -I did not mean that.
That was in the heat of an argument.
-Your Honor, I have a statement. -Yes, I’ve read it, thank you.
-We actually wrote a new one. -Ma’am, excuse me, but I have--
Please, Your Honor, we were up late working on it.
I can read it very fast.
[clears throat] "Lizzy once asked us why we took them in.
And at the time, we couldn’t answer her."
-Ma’am, please sit down. -[Ellie] Please,
Your Honor, can you let me say the answer?
No. Sit.
This hearing is not about you.
Judging by Lizzy’s statement, you might be back in court soon enough,
so let’s save that heartwarming speech for that occasion.
Okay. Now, Miss Viara,
I see you’ve been keeping up with your visits. That’s good.
I also understand you’ve been sober for the last five months.
Is that still the case?
Yes. That’s very good news.
And if I were to put the kids in your care,
your current residence could accommodate them?
-I think so. -It’s small,
-I think so. -It’s small, but it works... Your Honor.
but it works... Your Honor.
[judge] And, Miss Viara,
do you feel capable of responsibly caring for Juan, Lita, and Lizzy at this time?
Miss Viara.
Mama.
Yes, Your Honor. I’m capable now.
Everybody get ready for dinner.
Here you go.
What if when we go live with our mom,
she doesn’t know how to make my noodles the way I like to have them?
Don’t worry, Lizzy'll show her the way we do the cheese for you
so your mom can make it for you just the way you like.
-[Ellie] Yeah. -Okay. [sniffles]
Come on, guys. Don’t be sad on our last night.
You know what, I think we should tell Pete and Ellie thank you,
you know, for everything they’ve done for us, yeah?
-Thank you. -Well, thank you, pal.
-Thank you. -Well, thank you, pal. Yeah, thank you, guys.
-Lita? -I don’t want to say anything.
Oh, honey.
I’m just gonna go check on Lita.
I mean, unless you want to.
Yeah, I would, actually. Thanks.
Come on, buddy. You haven’t touched your pasta.
You want me to reheat it for you?
It’s okay, buddy.
That’s okay, buddy.
-Good night, buddy. -Good night.
Sweetie, good night. I love you.
Love you too.
Okay, all your court bears are in here, the new ones as well.
Speaking of court, um...
...I just wanted to apologize for what I wrote to the judge.
-It was all true. -[Pete] Yeah. It was a little
-It was all true. -[Pete] Yeah. It was a little out of context maybe, but there’s no hard feelings.
Actually, I wanted to give you the statement we wrote
that we couldn’t read in court, just so you have it.
Yeah.
-[car approaching] -Guys, Mom’s here.
All right. Get up! Come on. Let’s go.
Lita, come on, get your stuff.
Bye, Meatball.
Hey. I’ve got a car seat for Lita if you don’t have one.
You guys picking us up?
Where’s Mom?
She was supposed to meet us at the office this morning and she didn’t show.
at the office this morning and she didn’t show.
Oh, no.
She didn’t answer her phone.
Did you go to her house? What if something
-happened to her? -Yes, we went to see her.
She was very ashamed. She said... -she can’t do it. -[Lizzy] No, she didn’t.
-she can’t do it. -[Lizzy] No, she didn’t. Because why would she, um, fill out all the forms
and the court and reunification stuff if she didn’t--
Lizzy, your mom said you filled out all those forms.
I helped, but so what?
[Sharon] She felt she was being pushed into something -she wasn’t ready for. -[Lizzy] No.
-she wasn’t ready for. -[Lizzy] No. I didn’t push her. She’s ready!
Just let me talk to her, please,
and then we can figure something out--
-[Karen] Honey. -...and she can take me home.
Honey, when we saw her, it was obvious.
She’s using again.
She’s not coming, baby.
Sweetie, we’re so sorry.
-[sobs] -Lizzy.
Lizzy.
I’ll go get her. You watch the kids.
-Just wait there, okay? -[Pete] Lizzy!
[Ellie] Lizzy!
Lizzy!
-Lizzy? -Lizzy!
-Lizzy. -Please just go away. -You’re not my parents. -[Pete] No, we’re not.
-You’re not my parents. -[Pete] No, we’re not. But you know what we are? We’re here.
That’s right, we’re here and we love you.
What? No, you don’t. You don’t even know me.
Hey, what the hell’s going on out here?
Could you just give us a few minutes, please?
Oh, okay. Sorry.
Lizzy, honey, we do know you.
We-- We know that you hate cheese,
but you really love cheeseburgers.
And we know that when you feel good in the morning,
you put on a little less makeup than you do on the bad days.
Exactly. And we know the most important thing in the world
to you is to protect Juan and Lita from the things nobody protected you from.
-We know that, right? -[Ellie] Yes, honey.
[whispers] You guys are doing good.
I’m sorry. We know there’s so much we don’t know.
But if you’re afraid that we can’t handle knowing the bad stuff, or the scary stuff,
we can, I promise.
Yeah, bring it. Whatever you got, we want it
because we love you, Lizzy.
Stop saying that. Please just go away, please.
Please.
-Is Lizzy okay? -She’s a little upset right now.
-Are you okay? -Yeah, I’m good.
Here she is.
So...
um, here’s what I think is best.
I know Juan and Lita are more like what you had in mind
-when you got into this. -Come on, baby.
So, I think the best thing is for you to adopt them.
And... And I’ll just ask Karen for, um, a different placement.
-So... -[Ellie] No.
-No, it’ll be good. -[Ellie] No, honey.
We need your help with Juan and Lita.
We’re not doing this without you.
I'll visit all the time, and you can call me
-if you need help for anything. -No.
Pete, I really don’t want to argue about this right now.
I don’t care. I said no. That’s not happening, okay?
-You’re with us now. -Yeah.
And you know why? We’ve got a cosmic connection.
That’s right, we’ve got a cosmic connection.
I know you feel sorry for me right now, -but you don’t have-- -It’s got nothing to do
-but you don’t have-- -It’s got nothing to do with what just happened.
Where’s the court statement Ellie gave you?
See this? Read that.
"Lizzy once asked me why we did this, why we took them in.
We couldn’t give her an answer at the time.
We did it because something was missing in our lives,
but we didn’t know what it was.
It was Juan, Lita, and Lizzy."
You see?
You were what was missing, Lizzy.
But now you’re here and you are stuck with us.
-[Ellie] That’s right. -We’ll be at every soccer game.
We’ll be all over your ass about your grades.
And we're gonna buy you your first prom dress.
Yeah, and it’s gonna be really pretty.
But not too revealing. Super sweet.
You know, not too sexy.
Just like... really, that gorgeous sweet spot.
[Pete] Yeah. And when you graduate high school,
we’re gonna be in the front row embarrassing you.
We’ll be in the front row again when you graduate college,
-or even if you don’t. -You will be graduating college,
-or even if you don’t. -You will be graduating college, ’cause it’s so important and you’re so smart.
I don’t mean to push, but it opens up so many more opportunities.
But either way, we’re gonna be there for you.
And someday, I’ll give you away at your wedding.
-What? -Even if I think the guy is a pissant and not good enough for my little girl.
That’s right. Someday in the future. Someday in the way, way, way off,
deep, deep, deep distant future.
Lizzy, can we go home now?
Yeah, I guess we can. [chuckles]
I know you don’t like this, but you’re gonna have
I know you don’t like this, but you’re gonna have to get used to it once in a while, okay?
Can I get one? I haven’t gotten a single hug from you since I’ve known you. Please?
from you since I’ve known you. Please?
Hi. I don’t know the whole context of everything.
But I’m just wondering if I can just get in on that hug a little bit.
We’re good! Thank you so much. We’re good, thank you.
Sorry. That was just wrong. Yeah, I just do that. You guys hug.
I crossed a boundary there.
Everything’s gonna work out great too.
I can tell. [gasps]
Hi!
Oh! Oh, thank you!
-Bye. -Bye!
Are you with them? Do you know those guys?
Yeah. Why?
Do you guys want to come in?
-Uh-- -I-- I made a pie.
-No, thank you. -Yes!
-Karen! -It’s pie. You know I love pie.
Great. Yeah, I just... I have so many feelings.

Okay!
[Pete] Whoa, Juan. What are you doing?
You can’t wear sneakers. We gotta look good today.
Mom, have you seen my phone?
Uh, no. Wait, you mean the one in your hand?
Lita, honey, did you go potty?
-I went potty! -[Ellie] Okay, good job.
-Everybody go potty? -Yeah, I went potty.

Good morning, folks.
You know, family court is important--
Wait. Wait! Wait! [sighs] Wait.
Grandma Sandy’s in the house. -[laughter] -[Sandy] We can begin.
Told you we’d make it. Stop it!
-These seats are saved. -They’re saved for me.
Move over.
Stop it!
-Go ahead, Judge. -Thank you, Grandma Sandy.
She got a T-shirt.
You know, family court is important work.
But it’s difficult work.
We spend day in and day out dealing with things
that we feel no family should have to go through.
So, on these rare days when we get to smile at work,
these days mean a great deal to all of us.
And I may not look it, but I’m a huge cornball
and I live for this.
Ronit?
-Yeah! -[people laughing]
I love this song.
We are here today to officially create a new family.
Peter and Elinore Wagner,
do you wish to adopt Juan, Lita, and Lizzy into your family today?
-Yes, Your Honor. -Yes, Your Honor.
It’s just the song that’s got me a little emotional.
Juan, Lita, and Lizzy,
would you like Peter and Elinore to be your mom and dad?
Sure.
-Yes, please. -Yes!
Well, then,
by the authority vested in me by the state of California,
I pronounce you a family.
♪ Nothing’s gonna stop us now ♪
-Here you go. -Thank you.
Would you like to take a picture with the judge?
-Yeah, sure. Thank you. -Yeah, let’s do it.
That’s gonna be us soon.
Oh, I’m part of this family too.
-Okay, thank you. -Wait, me too!
-I’d like to be in the picture. -Are you sure? We’re not--
We should all go. I think they’d like that.

Hey, sweetie. Don't pick at your scab. Come on.
I was just checking. Did you make that hole?
It was already like that.
It'll leave a scar.
I wouldn't even have a scab if Lily Stevens didn't push me.
Lily Stevens wouldn't have pushed you if you hadn't thrown chalk at her.
She was making faces at me.
[woman] We don't hurt people.
Not ever. She deserved to be hurt.
[gasps] No, she didn't.
Clara, no one deserves to be hurt, no one.

So that is on the list, and I'm gonna put it down as number two
because last--
[Tony Robbins on podcast] We grow or we die.
So, we're unaware that we use events as a trigger to get home back to the patterns we know
to get home back to the patterns we know even if it's uncomfortable.
So, if you identify where you live,
emotionally, the patterns that are limiting you,
-the second piece is find the antidote. -[phone dings] -Shit. -[Robbins] We all will face,
-Shit. -[Robbins] We all will face,
multiple times in our life, extreme stress.
The difference in peoples' lives is not what we face,
it's what we do with what we face.
Life gives us these events, these, quote, "horrific events,"
because there's an area of our life that has to grow.
You can take yourself from a place
where in the face of absolute total tragedy, you triumph...
[softly] You've gotta be kidding me.
Oh, shit.
[Clara, sleepily] Mommy...
why did we stop?
Oh, great.
Where are we, Mommy?
Somewhere, sweetie.
[woman] You know, Poppy taught me how to change a tire.
One day I'll teach you.
In the meantime, you should probably come over here and...
get a head start and pay attention.
[Clara] Nah, that's boring.
Yeah, suit yourself.
Maybe you can help by getting Mommy her coffee.
-[Clara] Mommy... -[sighs] Oh, God.
[Clara] When we get to Oklahoma, can we...
Clara?
Clara?
-Show me! -Mommy, it bit me!
Let me see, Clara.
Oh, God. Okay. It's okay, sweetie.
It's okay. It's okay.
Come on, come on. Oh, it's okay. Clara? Clara?
Oh, it's okay. Clara? Clara? Come on, baby.
Oh, sweetie.
Hold on, sweetie.

Hello?
Is anybody home?
Hello?
Come on, stay with me, baby, okay?
Just stay with me, baby. Stay with me.
Oh, God. Come on, come on.
I'm so sorry for barging in.
My little girl, she got bitten by a snake,
and I really need your help.
I got a flat tire, and I can't get a signal.
She's really burning up. I don't know what to do.
You're in luck, darlin'.
I've worked on many a bite out here. Let me help her.
Oh, thank God.
-Oh, she's going blue. She's going blue! -Here, let me.
-Oh, she's going blue. She's going blue! -Here, let me. Please help her!
What can you do? The nearest town's Tulia.
You'll find a hospital there.
You best get that tire sorted out.

[softly] Okay. Come on, sweetie.
[man] We'll keep her in for the day, monitor her condition,
but trust me, if a five-year-old was bitten by a rattlesnake...
[chuckles] you'd know it.
From the looks, it's just exhaustion, mild dehydration.
You should've seen her. She was burning up, she wasn't breathing.
She turned blue, for Christ sakes.
[doctor] Were you feeling out of sorts at all during the drive?
[woman] No.
-[doctor] Medication? You taking anything? -[woman] Nothing, no.
Listen, Phoenix to Oklahoma can be a long haul.
Yeah, well, I'm not a very good flier, so driving was the lesser of two evils.
[doctor] Were you feeling, uh...
Is this necessary?
...apprehensive or... stressed before the drive?
No. Uh, yes, I guess.
It's been pretty crazy. Um...
We're starting over, and the move's been a lot on Clara.
You're a single mother?
Yes.
[doctor] Slightly elevated. Not surprising, but nothing alarming.
Look, I know this sounds crazy.
But there has to be some kind of explanation.
I mean, that old woman, maybe she had...
I don't know, like an ancient remedy on her shelf or something.
I'm just... I'm just telling you what happened.
[doctor] Your daughter's gonna be fine. She just needs to rest.
You need to do the same.
Get some sleep.
[man] That's all it is. God's will.
[sobs] I know.
[man] Such a pretty little thing.
To think we almost lost her.
You really are lucky. Things could have ended much differently.
You are?
I'm here to talk about your payment, Ms. Ridgeway.
Why don't you pull up a chair?
So, we have insurance, my daughter and I, both.
We're both covered.
Oh, I'm not talking about your hospital debt.
I'm talking about the other debt.
The one you now owe.
What was done for your daughter doesn't come cheap.
Her little soul was spared.
And now you owe one in return.
I'm sorry, I thought you said soul.
Ms. Ridgeway, you don't have long to pay your debt.
You only have until sunset, which is...
now only...
seven hours away.
The soul you take can be any one of your choosing,
but it must be human.
And it must be paid in full and on time.
Okay, I...
don't really understand what's going on.
I don't know who you are. I think I'm gonna call security.
I would like you to leave the room, leave my daughter alone.
Failure to meet your debt, Ms. Ridgeway,
will result in your daughter's condition returning to what it was.
I'd like you to leave now.
Let me, uh, remind you of what that'd look like.
Clara? Clara?
-Sweetie? -She will suffer...
What've you done to her?
...before she succumbs to the snake venom...
working its way through her tiny body.
No, please, stop it.
She will die, Ms. Ridgeway, that I can assure you.
Make it stop! Fucking get out of here! Get out!
Help! Someone come in here, now! Please, somebody help me!
[man] Seven hours, Ms. Ridgeway.
You best get a move on.
[woman] I need help! In here!
Quick, please!
Okay, I need you to call-- -[female nurse] Did something happen here? -[alarm stops]
-Who do you want us to call? -Miss?
Miss?
Miss?
-[male nurse] Should I call security? -No, no, no, no! No, don't.
-[male nurse] Should I call security? -No, no, no, no! No, don't. That won't be necessary.
[female nurse] Are you okay?
[woman] I've been up since before dawn, driving.
Maybe I need to check into the motel across the road.
[female nurse] That's probably for the best. We'll keep an eye on her for you.
[woman] Okay, I'll just say goodbye to her.
[softly] Oh, my God.
[cries] I don't know what's going on, Clara.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
This is insane.
I just want you to be okay.
[operator] 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
Hello?
9-1-1, what's your emergency?
Great.
[yells] I'm fine!
I'm fine, I don't need any help!
She's gonna die, Katrina!
Only one way to save her! Stay away from me.
There's nowhere to run!
[cries] You stay away from me!
Fuck off!
[news reporter] This is the diner in Tulia, Texas
where 47-year-old lawyer Donald Covington was fatally stabbed in the chest
by 32-year-old school teacher Michael James Warner just before sunset.
Witnesses say Warner kept repeating, in a bizarre manner,
"A soul for a soul," as he attacked Covington.
Warner is currently in cu--
[Katrina] "The difference is not what we face,
it's what we choose to do when we face it." "The difference is not what we face,
it's what we choose to do when we face it."
Thank you.
Hey, um...
I'm so sorry... about before.
That... that was so nosy of me.
I shouldn't have just been peering into your room like that.
It's fine.
No, I just wanted to offer my condolences.
He's not gone yet.
Oh, no. Uh... Of course not.
-You wanna sit? -Oh, sure, sure.
Such a... [clears throat] Such a strange thing...
waiting for your daddy to die.
Anyway, I'm sorry. What brings you here?
my daughter, she got sunstroke.
We've been driving all day, and... she's not feeling too well.
[woman] How's she doing? She's fine. Um...
Doctor thinks she just needs some rest.
Um, I'm Loraine.
Susan.
Anyway, um, it was nice chatting with you.
I hope you and your little one get out of here soon.
Well, uh, actually she's out for the count right now
and I am going stir-crazy in that silence all by myself.
So I was wondering if maybe, uh, I could...
uh, keep you company.
[Loraine] With Daddy?
[Loraine] Apparently, they can hear you.
The nurse described it kind of like a...
like a two-way mirror or...
Or was it a one-way mirror?
Either way, he won't be waking up.
But I'm still here, Daddy.
You okay, Susan?
He seems to be at peace.
Yeah.
-[cell phone vibrates] -Oh, shoot.
Hey, y'all here?
B-7. No, it's at the, um...
All right, just wait there, I'm coming.
Leave it to my sister to get lost in a hospital this small.
I gotta go grab 'em.
I should go get Clara.
-[Loraine] Thank you, Susan. -Sure.
[whispers] I have to do this, I have to do this.
I have to do this, I have to do this, I have to do this, I have to do this.
Loraine...
who is this?
I was just using the, um, bathroom.
[man] Frank?
Jesus Christ, lady!
Are you all right?
-Wh... What the hell happened? -Stay away from me.
[driver] What were you thinking?
I almost ended you!
Is everything okay?
Hey, you don't... You don't look all right.
Look, you want me to call someone?
Let...
You fucking serious?
Hey!
Fucking bath salts, man.
-That one's on the house. -[door opens]
♪ I fall to pieces... ♪ [bartender] Well, hell, Abbie.
What, you gonna put this down to another roller derby injury, huh?
It's a heck of a sport you chose there. Just give me a beer, Francine.
Please?
Definition of insanity
is doing the same thing and expecting a different result.
[Abbie]  So they say.
I know you?
Come on. Enough's enough.
Let me stay, please, just a little while.
Get up off that stool, Abbie. [Francine] Billy, just let her finish her damn beer.
This don't concern you, Francine, unless, of course, you want it to.
[Francine] Can't have y'all getting into it here.
-Abbie... -All right.
All right.
Let's go.
[Billy] Hold up.
Apologize to Francine for coming in here and making a scene,
upsetting this nice customer.
Go on.
Sorry.
Just get out of here, both of y'all.
Go on, get!
Place has gone to shit anyways.
[Francine] Mm-hmm. Go on.
Go, get out!
-[door closes] -Ain't they a pair?
They live near here?
[Francine] Oh, yeah, Tulia's finest.
Only a matter of time before she ends up in the obituaries.
Some people are just beyond help.
Get off...
[Billy] Why you always gotta make a scene?
Get in that fucking truck.
Get in the truck! I'm not standing here in the goddamn street!
Come on. Get in!
12 Amarosa. 12 Amarosa.
12 Amarosa.
[man] Well, go on. It ain't gonna bite you.
Lightweight, easily concealable,
but most important: accurate.
Shoots a maximum of 16 rounds through a flush-fitted magazine.
I'll do you two boxes for the price of one.
You ever, uh, fire one of those, darlin'? I'll take it.
All right.
I'm just gonna need to see your license. You're a Texas resident, I take it.
No.
Well, I'm afraid I can't be letting you purchase a firearm.
Residents of Texas only. Look...
my daughter and I, we were, uh...
attacked on the road.
I feel like I need protection. And I don't know what you can do, but maybe you could just...
And I don't know what you can do, but maybe you could just... just turn a blind eye, or... I don't...
When did it get to be like this?
When did the open roads of this great country of ours revert to such savagery?
It's not right, not one bit.
Where's your little one?
In the hospital.
Jesus. What...?
I'm sorry, I can't help you, but...
this man can.
His name's Charlie. Lives here in Tulia. You can find him here.
It's a cash-only transaction.
I guess you'd call him a private dealer.
[man, over speaker] What you want?
Hi. Earl, uh, sent me.
Hi. Earl, uh, sent me. He said he'd vouch for me. Are you Charlie?
[Charlie] Lose the cap.
Okay, Katrina Ridgeway.
I'm gonna have to do a quick body check.
Is that really necessary?
Okay.
-You want me to fix you up some tea? -No, thank you.
More of a coffee drinker, huh?
I guess.
My wife, Tracy, she'd stock the cupboard
full of a whole variety of exotic flavors.
Hibiscus was her favorite.
-So, can we-- -You sure you don't wanna try some?
It's no trouble. I'm sure.
[stammers] I... I've gotta go.
Tracy is no longer with us.
She took the barrel of a Glock, identical to the one that you're buying...
and put it in her mouth.
Okay, I am so sorry...
so sorry to hear about your wife, but I've gotta get going.
Listen to me, just...
rabbiting on.
Yeah, she's... She's all yours.
The piece, that is.
The rounds are another 50.
I... think I've got 40.
I mean, I can rustle up the other ten, but I've gotta go.
[sighs] I ain't gonna deprive a woman of carrying a piece.
Now, what kind of a man would I be?
I'll let the ten slide.
Thank you, thank you.
You ever handle one of them before?
'Cause if you need some pointers...
I offer that for free.
No, I'm, uh...
Who's the unlucky son of a bitch?
What?
They got it coming?
You out to end someone. I can see it in your eyes, plain as day.
So, I wanna know.
I wanna know, Katrina Ridgeway...
that you're sure...
that they got it coming.
[man over video] Hi, it's me again, Mr. Glock.
Uh, I thought today, uh, one of the Glocks  I've not demonstrated
or talked about, is the good old reliable Glock 19.
It's a magazine full of bullets in it,
and it also has one in the chamber.
I'll quickly check that.
Shit. The towels are all wet.
[Abbie] Oh, I put them in before work. They're in the drier.
-[Billy] I'll get 'em. -[Abbie] You sure?
[Billy] Can't have my girl drying off with no wet towel.
Here.
[Billy] We gotta leave at 7:00. [Abbie] Okay.
[Billy] We'll eat there? [Abbie] Sure.
Come here.
You know...
You haven't finished your punishment yet.
[Abbie] I'm not feeling so good. Maybe we can rain check?
You already made a fool of me once today.
[Abbie, stammering] Please...
[Billy] Without order, what are we? [Abbie] Okay. Okay.
[Abbie] Okay. Okay. [Billy] What would we be?
[groans in pain] Animals.
[softly] Animals.
You don't wanna be an animal.
[Abbie] No.
Half-hour should do it. Come on.
I said come on!
but Williams was able to score.
The fuck you doing? Get your stupid ass back up there!
What the fuck?
The fuck are you?
[Katrina, stammering] Take the keys.
-Slowly. -Okay.
Nice and slow.
[Katrina, breathing heavily] Okay, um...
Put the beer down.
-[Billy] Okay, I'm putting it down. -Okay.
Slowly.
-Okay. -Beer's down.
Okay. Get on the floor.
You get down.
Okay. You stay there. Don't move, okay?
Thank you.
Okay, get up. Get up.
-If you want the truck-- -Just get up!
I want you to tell me...
how to get to the garage. Can we get to the garage from the house?
-Yeah? -Mm-hmm. Okay.
You're gonna show me.
[Katrina] Turn on the light.
Okay. Let's go, down.
We're going for a drive.
I want you to follow my directions.
I'm gonna take you somewhere.
Okay? You just listen to what I tell you.
So, get in the car.
Just get in.
Just... Just look ahead.
Hey, uh, left at the T-junction.
-Where are we going? -Just make a left.
Pull over.
Kill the engine.
Toss the keys back here slowly.
Please...
Please...
Just tell me what you want.
I can get you money.
I can get you anything you want. Please, just tell me.
Get out of the truck.
No. 'Cause if I do, you'll shoot me.
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. Get out of the truck.
[tearfully] Why are you gonna kill me?
Just tell me what I've done so I know, please.
Please don't kill me.
-Stop crying. -Please.
-I don't wanna die! -Stop... Stop crying.
I can't help it because you're gonna kill me.
Look, I need you to hold yourself together
and get out of the fucking truck, okay? You hear me?
Please, because, look, I know I've done some fucked up things in this lifetime.
Okay, I know I have.
But please, if you tell me, I can fix it, I promise.
Please, 'cause I don't wanna die!
Okay, listen to me, you piece of shit! I just want your fucking truck.
No, no, no, no, no.
[panting] Oh, God!
[yells] Where are you, you piece of sh...
-[woman, in Australian accent] Well... -[shutter clicks]
you gave it your best shot, Kat.
Stay there. That's good. Hold that.
Nice.
Please.
There has to be another way to put this right.
She's just a child.
Please, there has to be...
some other way.
Sorry, Kat.
You know what you gotta do.
Promise me...
she'll be all right.
You promise me...
if I do this...
it'll be over...
and you'll leave her alone.
Fair's fair.
Clara...
I want you to know that I love you so, so, so much...
from the bottom of my heart.
[sniffles] And...
none of this is gonna makes sense because it doesn't make any sense.
But I want you to know that I didn't want to leave you.
And I had to do... I had to do...
I had to do what I had to do to keep you safe.
I want you to remember me.
And keep me close to your heart as best as you can.
And, uh, don't let me fade.
I love you so much.
I love you so, so, so much, sweetie.
[Clara, whispering] Mommy.
Come on, you crazy bitch!
Give me them fucking keys.
Now what, huh?
You wanna fucking play?
The fuck you doing?
What the fuck?
Please, no.
Please, just stop...
Why are you doing this?
Please stop. Please...
Why?
Why are you doing this?
Why?
Shh. [softly] It's all right.
It'll all be over soon.
You're crazy, you fucking bitch.
You're gonna burn in hell for this.
You're gonna fucking burn, you fucking bitch.
You're gonna burn in hell for this! You'll burn!
We'll see.
Hello? [doctor] Hello, Ms. Ridgeway?
Speaking.
This is Dr. Hayes. I'm calling about your daughter Clara.
I've been trying you for around an hour now.
Tell me. Sorry?
How is she?
She's fine. She's up, ready to go. She's wondering where you are. [chuckles]
So am I, for that matter.
Tell her I'm on my way. I'll be there soon.
Okay, will do. I'll make sure she gets something to eat.
Thank you.
-[Clara] Mommy! -Hey, sweetie.
[Clara] They gave me red jello and ice cream.
Ooh, they did, sweetie? Yeah, and spaghetti for dinner.
What happened to your neck?
Oh, I scratched it.
Did it hurt?
Yeah, a little.
When are we leaving? Do I have to stay in here?
No, we don't. We're free to go now.
[Katrina] Yeah. No, you're right, Mom, I should have called you right back, but I just didn't want to bother you.
I should have called you right back, but I just didn't want to bother you. But we're hitting the road now, yeah.
No. Promise you, everything is all good.
[Clara] What letter are we up to?
Mommy?
What, sweetie?
What letter were we up to?
I can't remember.
You decide.
[Clara] Okay.
Hitchhiker, Mommy.
H for hitchhiker.
Did you see him, Clara?
Did you see him?
[Clara] Yeah.
Where do you think he's going, Mommy?
I'm not sure, sweetie.
[Clara] Your turn, Mommy. We're up to I.
Mommy? Come on, Mommy.
I...
I...
Why is there a monkey?
That is Iago.
Iago is a monkey?
I thought you said Iago was Jusuf Superior.
He is.
In more ways than one.
My father sent him here, so I would not be homesick
during my first Christmas away from the Kingdom,
and also to punish him for crashing the Royal Maserati.
Well, what is he doing in my bed?
Oh, he is just asserting his dominance. [chuckles]
The important thing is to not let him use his scent gland to mark it.
Too late. This is his bed now.
What's with the nasty old cabbages?  Is this for the monkey?
Teddy, you sound ridiculous.
The cabbages are for Magnus, the magical Christmas moose.
Not gonna ask, don't care.
Every Christmas Eve,
Magnus the Moose flies all over the world eating rotten cabbages
and pooping chocolate candies. [chuckles]
And the best part of all, Magnus performs miracles
for those who are true of heart.
It is the greatest Christmas tradition in the world.
No, the greatest Christmas tradition in the world
is the East Peoria Festival of Lights.
Last year, they brought the house down with a giant light-up wreath,
and four candy canes.
How will they ever top that?
Perhaps with five candy canes?
A boy could dream.
Peoria has some very strange traditions.
Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time for me
to scream my Christmas wish into a towel.
What was that?
That was me wishing for you to have a fantastically great Christmas.
And I think Iago wished for you to stay out of his bed.
Oh,  Teddy. [chuckles]
It does not work with a pillow.
I wasn't making a wish.
This is so much fun, Regina. Thank you for letting me help decorate.
Oh, anytime. And if you're lucky,
next time I'll let you decorate the windows with glass cleaner.
Sorry. Usually works on Emil.
I'm just glad to be out of the house.
My moms think Christmas is too commercial, so we never do anything fun.
You guys give each other gifts, right?
No.
But we do give each other feedback on areas of improvement.
Yeah, they call it "Constructive Criticis-mas."
Well, in that case, I hope you don't get anything this year.
-Oh, that's so sweet! -[both chuckle]
Why don't you go up to the attic and get the rest of the decorations?
They're there behind a box marked "naked photos."
What?
They're just photos I haven't framed yet.
That is a terrible way to label that box.
Merry Christmas, Jingle Berries!
-Here's the tree you ordered. -Oh! Wow!
That is a whole lot of tree for 20 bucks, Braughner.
I keep my prices down by going straight to the source: the park.
This one even came with a piece of metal paper.
"On this spot,
1854, Abraham Lincoln." Yada, yada, yada... Who cares.
Well, you can't take it back, so...
Thanks, Abe.
Okay, you can set it up over there.
The bowling alley is officially closed. All the decorations are up,
and for the first time in my life, I have finished my Christmas shopping early.
Yes. It is time for some of Mama's special nog.
Regina, I brought you a gift!
Joosep!
-I didn't get Joosep a gift! -Oh! This is going to be awkward.
Merry Christmas to me.
It's very cold out here.
Oh, yes, it is warmer in here.
That's a pretty big gift, Regina. What did you get him?
Here's 20 more dollars to go away.
Go-away money's what bought me my dirt bike.
Can't believe you got me a gift. I mean, of course I got you a gift, too.
It's just I got to go find--
Wrap it.
So, I'll... BRB.
And Airbnb to you you as well.
Would you look at that?
"In 1854, Abraham Lincoln was in this very bowling alley."
Incredible.
What the heck are you doing?
Hanging smelly socks on a string to keep my wishes safe
from Wendell the Winter Weasel.
But those are my socks.
And they are the stinkiest.
-Who is it? -Sire, just me, Joosep, your royal guard,
living incognito in America to protect your identity
as the only living heir to the Kingdom of Buronia.
Side question: is anyone else in there with you?
You already know. You don't count.
Anyway, sire, I have brought you your royal long johns
because it has begun to snow.
It would be a dereliction to my duties
for you to come down with a case of frostbutt.
You mean frostbite?
Please, if you ever had a case of frostbutt, you'd wish you had frostbite.
Whatever. The Festival of Lights starts in four hours,
so we better head down there to get a good seat.
Great idea! But why not get into the spirit
by singing a classic Buronian Christmas carol?
Because I don't want to?
Fine. One song.
-Yay! -Yay!
♪ On the first day of Christmas Dear Magnus gave to me ♪
♪ Asparagus from Jogan's Grocery ♪
Is that some kind of commercial?
♪ On the second day of Christmas Dear Magnus gave to me ♪

Sydney, I need your help.
The stores are closed for Christmas Eve, so I need something to re-gift to Joosep.
What would you get a guy that you've hung out
but you're not dating, but you're not not dating?
There's a lot of gray area there.
I got it!
Horse costume.
No, it's got to be nice, but not too nice, or he'll think I care too much.
But if it's not nice enough, he'll think I don't care at all.
There's a lot of gray area there.
So... horse costume.
You're overthinking this.
All I got Tanner for Christmas was a laser pointer, he loves it.
For school presentations?
No, he chases the dot around like a cat.
I don't want to offend you,
but I think Joosep is a little more mature and cultured than Tanner.

[shouts] Stop! Stop! Just stop it right now.
But we only had 50 verses left.
Come on, let's get down to the lights. No!
What the heck is this?
Dude, it's snow.
Yes, yes, we appear to be snowed in.
How could this happen?
Well, it appears a low-pressure system from the north
has combined with precipitation from the south,
resulting in the ample snowfall you see before you.
Where did that come from?
Have you seen this hair? I was born to be a weatherman.
Back to you, Teddy.
This is bad. This is really bad.
You're right to panic.
I've watched enough disaster movies to know this is going to get ugly quick.
Time to load up on rations.
It's a Magnus the Moose Miracle.
-Is this not wondrous, Teddy? -No.
We have to get to the light show. I've never missed it.
Do not worry, Teddy.
Magnus the Moose always provides
to the little boys and girls who scream into their towel the hardest.
I'm calling emergency services.
Okay, you distract Joosep, while I run down to the gas station
and get him some Lottery scratchers and some chocolate do-- Nuts!
-We're snowed in. -Ah, Regina, there you are.
This is a perfect time to open your gift.
No, no, not before I finish wrapping your gift,
which is really great, but not too great.
There's a lot of gray area there.
Hey, do you own a horse costume?
Of course.
It was the most wonderful gift I ever received.
I told you. [laughs]
I'm gonna find him something from the kitchen. Distract Joosep.
I'm on it. Joosep.
Look!
What is that?
Hey, the red dot's back.
Looks like we're going to be here a while.
Emil, I'm gonna be honest.
Okay, you're the only person here I trust.
We should form an alliance.
You frighten me, and I'm going to stand over here now.
Teddy, I'm going to be honest,
you're the only person here I trust.
We should form an alliance.
Braughner, I'm dealing with something very important right now.
Yes, I need a snow plow, so I can see some light-up candy canes.
Why should hospitals get first priority?
Well, I'm dying to see some Christmas lights.
Hello?
Hey, what are you doing up here?
I'm on my way to the Festival of Lights.
All I got to do is hop down the snow bank,
then it's a breezy three-mile trip down to the light show.
I do not know if that's a great idea. It is fresh snow, so--
Oh, look at all this fun stuff!
Lights, costumes...
Naked photos?
They're just pictures without frames on them.
My mom's terrible at labeling boxes.
That explains this box of children's organs.
East Peoria Light Show, here I come!
Teddy!
I think I got frostbutt.
Teddy!
What are you doing?
[quavering] I'm going to the light show.
Doesn't really look like it.
Yeah, honey, it's snowing really hard out there.
I don't think we're gonna make it this year.
Oh, yes, we are.
Robots!
Robots!
Well, my son has officially lost it.
Now, help me wrap this couch.
Teddy, I have noticed you are a little worked up about missing the light show.
I'm not missing it!
Yes, that, there. That is what I'm talking about.
Why do you care so much?
I just do, okay, but it's all going to be fine.
Because Doug the Dig-Bot is going to drill us down to Detweiller Drive...
dude.
Well, before that, there's something I think you'll want to see downstairs.
Fine. I can't charge him up here anyway.
Iago is using up every outlet.
Why does a monkey even need a curling iron?
You think he just wakes up looking like that?
Okay, so I didn't have quite enough wrapping paper to finish the whole couch,
but what do you think?
I think the only thing you're worse at than labeling boxes is finding gifts.
But don't worry. You have time.
I taped the laser pointer to the ceiling fan,
Joosep and Tanner will be chasing that thing around for hours.
We got the dot!
And its hiding spot.
So, now that mystery's been solved, let us open your gift.
Hey, look!
We're out of nuts!
Can't have Christmas without nuts.
All right, so, what did you want to show me?
Well, I know you are a big fan of the Festival of Lights,
but I think you will forget all about that, once you see
Emil's Festival of Delights.
I found these in a box labeled "naughty" stuff.
Magnus provides.
[all] Magnus provides!
Now, everybody gather round and prepare to be dazzled.
Prepare to be dazzled!
Oh no, no. We only do that on "Magnus provides."
[shouts] Emil, don't!
No, no, no! [grunts]
Oh, dear. The power's gone out.
I don't like the dark. I don't like the dark!
Things are about to get crazy, muscles.
I'm going to be honest. You're the only person here I trust.
-What do you think about alliances? -Alliances?
I think they're my favorite animal in the zoo.
Never mind.
Come on, Tanner, let's go find some flashlights.
And I'll come with you because I'm currently terrified.
It's no use. The power's out,
and you totally fried Doug the Dig-Bot.
Now I'll never make it to the Festival of Lights.
I am sorry, Teddy
But, do not worry.
The wish that I screamed very loudly into a towel
was for you to have a fantastically great Christmas.
Magnus will make this right.
Dude, enough with the Magnus.
But Magnus always provides.
[Joosep and Tanner] Magnus provides!
Although he usually does grant his wishes by now,
but that is no reason to lose our faith in Magnus.
Magnus isn't real.
It's clearly something Buronian parents made up
for their gullible kids to believe in.
Oh, yeah? Then where do the chocolate poops come from?
They're chocolate kisses.
-But that would mean my wishes-- -Are never coming true.
Nobody's wishes are coming true!
Don't look at me like that.
[Regina] Hey, Teddy.
-What are you doing up here? -Trying to see the end of the light show.
Oh, I think I saw something!
Just a stupid shooting star.
Okay, what's going on with you?
I wanted to see the candy canes as much as anybody, but it's not that big a deal.
It's not the candy canes.
It's Dad.
The Festival of Lights was his favorite,  remember?
He used to always take us.
Of course I remember. He'd put on that Santa hat
and play Mariah Carey's Christmas album on a loop.
It was so annoying.
So annoying.
And I really miss him.
Me, too.
Every year, since he passed away, I feel like...
I remember less and less about him.
The light show always reminds me.
I guess I'm just afraid that if I don't go, then...
I'll forget him.
Teddy, you could never forget your dad.
He's a part of you.
You think you got all that science stuff from me?
Definitely not.
Okay. A little quick with the answer there.
We'll always miss your dad.
But we're still a family.
And now Emil is a part of our family, too.
Oh, Emil.
I think I might have totally ruined his Christmas.
Oh, I'm sure it's not that bad.
As long as you didn't tell him that, that Magical Moose isn't real.
Well...
Teddy!
I know.
Well, maybe you still have time to make it up to him.
Maybe you're right.
Thanks, Mom.
Anytime.
That was a real sweet moment back there.
Braughner, what are you doing up here?
Look, Regina. I'm going to be honest.
You're the only person around here I trust.
What do you say we form an alliance?
Yeah, I'm already in an alliance with everybody else.
Except you.
What? You all turned against me?
You traitors!
Okay, so what's it going to take to get me in?
Two hundred bucks?
Deal!
Hey guys! I'm in the alliance!
Okay. Okay. I'm downstairs.
Can you stop pulling my hair with your dirty little paws?
-[monkey eeks] -Okay, I deserve that.
Is that... Magnus?
Yes, it is me, Magnus,
and I am here to restore your faith in...
me, Magnus.
And I'm a butt.
Quiet, Butt!
Regina! Found some more candles and...
Oh, hot lemon cider!
It's Magnus!
Yes, but...
stand back, because I got gas from all the cabbage I've been eating.
[Tanner] You do?
[Teddy] Be quiet, Butt!
Well, surely you do not have too much gas to perform your signature song and dance.
My what?
You know, the Clip-Clop Hop.
[chuckles] I don't know. I'm very tired.
Wait. If you really were Magnus, you would want to do the Clip-Clop Hop.
Thank you... Joosep.
He knows my name.
Here goes something.

♪ Magnus, the Christmas Moose ♪
♪ I come from the land of the trout ♪
♪ The Christmas Moose! ♪

♪ Do not put your fingers near my snout ♪
Happy Birthday!
Magnus!
Oops.
Com on, Tanner.
I appreciate your silly little stunt, Teddy.
How'd you know it was me?
From... everything.
I was the butt.
Yes, you were.
Listen, Emil.
I'm really sorry about earlier.
I was just mad about missing the light show because... [sighs]
it's something I shared with my dad.
Oh,Teddy, I had no idea.
But that's no reason for me to ruin your Christmas.
I mean, for all I know, Magnus could exist.
No, no. You were right.
It never made much sense.
I mean, why would a moose want a rotten cabbage?
That's what you find hard to believe?
It is too bad, though, because really,
I did wish for you to have a fantastically great Christmas.
But... I guess it was silly for me to believe in miracles.
What was that?
Are you guys hearing that, too?
I think it's coming from the lanes.
I could've sworn it was--
Wow!
It's beautiful.
I bet I can catch him!
This is incredible!
Wait.
Is this my present?
Yes! Of course it is. I mean, it certainly wasn't this.
Well, I do feel badly that my gift is so practical.
An industrial strength snowblower?
Yes, I heard it was going to snow, and I thought it might come in handy
to get us to the Festival of Lights.
This is freaking majestic.
Something is going on with my eyes.
They're sweating.
I don't know why there's a monkey here.
Bring it in, fur ball!
It's nice.
My dad would have loved this.
This is a fantastically great Christmas.
How did you make a festival of lights right here in the bowling alley?
I did not do this. I thought you did.
What?
The power is still out.
There's no scientific explanation for any of this.
-Magnus? -Magnus?
Is that cabbage?
Is this poop?
No.
It's chocolate poop.
Look!
Is that a flying moose?
It's a miracle!
It really is.
Magnus provides.
[all] Magnus provides.
Oh, just a head's up, not all of these poops are chocolate.

Mama! Mama! There's a little green boy in the swamp over there!
-He's right over there! -[Arlo gasps]
Now, Sansavelt, -don't you go telling tales again. -[melancholy music playing]
The world out there must be something, hey, Jeromio?
-[Edmee] Arlo! -[gasps] Uh-oh.
-Bye, Jeromio! -[croaks]
Got it!
Oh, snap!
Arlo!
Arlo!
-Now, where can that little gator boy be? -[splashes]
-[Arlo grunts] -Ah, there's my little chef.
-Now, what'd you find for tonight's stew? -[panting]
Only the best.
Snails, huh? I thought you hated snails.
Escargot. I'm trying to be, um… more Cajun. [smacks lips]
Nice and plump.
Yeah. I spent all afternoon tracking that fella.
Of course you did. Did you make sure this one's ripe?
What do you mean?
Well, you gotta taste his underbelly. Every swamp chef knows that.
Go on now.
A Frenchman would bite your hand off for that ripe fella.
Tastes like all the things it's been sliding around on.
I have to give it to you, Arlo. [chuckles] You are committed.
So, tell me. How many riverboats did you see today?
Just one.
A little boy saw me, though.
I mean, I wasn't trying to cause a fuss or anything like that. I just…
-[melancholy music plays] -Is something wrong with me?
-[slow, uplifting music playing] -Arlo, there is everything right with you.
And if anybody ever says otherwise, well…
But still,
I've been in this swamp my whole life,
and the animals don't ever seem to take to me.
And then, I'm not supposed to be out there near those boats and…
Don't get me wrong. I love the swamp. I do. But…
You were just doing what comes natural to anybody your age.
-You want to see what's out there. -[adventurous music playing]
Yeah, I guess so.
It's just, sometimes I wonder how I fit into the big old picture.
Well, now, go ahead and set this old snail loose.
There's something I've been meaning to give you for a while.
Now, I know I put that somewhere around here.
No. That's not it. Nope. What the heck.
Could have sworn I put--
-Well, what is it? -A gift.
[scoffs] I shouldn't.
Sure you can. I'm gifting it to you.
You know I can't accept gifts unless it's my birthday.
It wouldn't be proper.
Maybe I'll just hold on to this -till next year. -[rattling softly]
Seriously?
[sighs] You gonna make me do this?
Please?
Okay.
-[upbeat banjo music playing] -You shouldn't have.
Oh, yeah!

Happy birthday, darling baby boy.
I love that! Okay, I'm ready for my gift.
"Arlo Beauregard."
I'm Arlo, but what's--
That is your full name.
It came along with you when you first showed up on the front porch all those years ago.
when you first showed up on the front porch all those years ago.
"Beauregard."
Wait, I showed up on the porch?
Floated up, more like.
In a little old basket.
You were so cute with your little green tail.
How come you never told me?
Now, that is a fair question, Arlo.
I reckon I-- I wanted you to feel like you belonged here with me.
But you're old enough to know the truth.
I'm not going to be around forever,
same as you're not meant to stay in this swamp forever.
If I'm not from the swamp, then where the heck did I come from?
"Bellevue Hospital, New York, NY"?
I did some looking into things a while back.
Turns out this New York is a pretty big deal.
I'm from New York City?
Does that mean my parents are in New York City?
Keep on reading.
"Father of child, Ansel T. Beauregard. Mother of child…"
There's no name listed.
That's sure funny, isn't it, Edmee? A mother without a name?

-I have a dad I never even knew about. -[croaks]
Oh, I know. It's crazy. And that's not even the whole thing.
I'm from a city called New York.
I always felt like I have a good life here,
but I never really belonged, if that makes sense.
And then, bam! Edmee goes and drops this on me.

-Whatcha doing, Edmee? -Whoa!
[chuckles] Well, I was planning on catching us something real good for breakfast, but…
fish ain't in the mood to eat, I guess.
I kind of know how they feel.
Edmee, I've been thinking about it,
and I… I don't know quite how to say this, but…
It's time, sweetie.
You're making the right decision.
Are you nervous to leave?
Yeah, a little.
Arlo, I've always tried to protect you from the outside world,
not because I was afraid for what it would do to you,
but maybe for fear of what it would do to me.
But seeing the young man you've become, well…
the world is going to be a better place with Arlo Beauregard out there in it.
You think?
I know.
I'm sorry I couldn't send you off with a fancy crawfish sandwich.
You've done more for me than anyone in the history of people.
Why don't you come to New York too?
This is your adventure.
My place is here,
wishing you well -and keeping you in my thoughts. -[uplifting music playing]
Plus, I got a slew of warrants out there for my arrest,
and I don't want to go to prison again.
-They'll never catch you. -Mmm.
Now remember, if you ever get lost,
you just let that wonderful little heart and all that joy inside your soul
be your guide.
Thank you, Edmee. I will never forget it.
-Jeromio! -[farts]
You take care of Edmee now. Keep her company.
You're gonna do great things, Arlo Beauregard.
You just keep on being you.
I will, Edmee. I promise.
I love you, Edmee.
Goodbye! -[buzzing] -[croaks]
Goodbye, Jeromio.
Goodbye, lantern. Goodbye, snake. Goodbye, full-blooded alligator.

is this here real-life…
alligator!
See that? Oh, he's all scared now.
That'll be 20 bucks. Pay up.
I ain't paying for that. Where are the alligators?
-Look, kid, our tour boat done broke down. -[bubbling]

Dead gators are so boring.

you can't sue us, we got nothing to be sued for.

Hello?
[man] Ruff, that you?
It's Lawrence down at the grease shop.
What do you want, Lawrence?
I think you might be interested in this alligator boy I'm looking at right here.
Is this one of them mobile homes?
[resonating] I like it.

I would pay tons of money to see that.
You would?

-[woman] Oh, I'll take that. -Hmm?
Why don't you be a nice little gator boy
-and come on over here to Aunt Stucky. -[chuckles nervously]
Little gator, -looks like you got out of the swamp. -Huh? [whimpers]
-Oh, don't worry there, little fella. -[crackles]
We got a real safe place for you to stay.
[Stucky] Yeah, we're gonna take real good care of you.
-Get him! -[panting]
[man] Don't scuff that hide now.
He's headed for the train tracks!
Don't lose him, Ruff!
-Little gator boy! -[Arlo whimpering]
[Ruff] What the heck?
You two better stay down if you want to see tomorrow.
Who are you?
I'm the reason you aren't being turned into a handbag right now.
-Now, we got a two-for-one. -[growls]
-[Arlo] Boop-boop. Hello. -Huh?
You look like an angel.
No squirming.
You must have some bullfrog in you.
Nah, I'm just a vegan.
What's a vegan?
-[Stucky] Y'all can try and run now… -[air hissing]
…but you sure as shoot can't hide.
-[both scream] -Out of my way!
[Ruff] Run! -Ladies first! -It's gonna crush us!
-Ladies first! -It's gonna crush us!
We gonna follow 'em, right?
Yeah, of course we're going to follow them.
Go get the Beast!
[gasps] Rickety biscuit.
Does it stop somewhere or go on forever and ever?
I don't know, kid. What do you think?
-[dreamy music playing] -Well, forever and ever I hope.
Yeah, me too.
I just now realized you saved my life, and I can't recall ever hearing your name.
Mmm, my name's Bertie.
Bertie. That's the best name I ever heard.
My name's Arlo Beauregard.
I come from the swamp.
Some people call it the bayou, but, uh, that's just a fancy name for swamp. [chuckles]
Where do you come from, Bertie?
Mmm. Nowhere special.
Sure you do!
You're the specialest person I've ever met.
-And how many people have you met, Arlo? -Um…
-Ten! Eight of them just today. -[snaps]
Including me?
Yes.
Well, I'd say that's quite an honor.
I'd say so too.

So… why did you leave the swamp?
Because I got a dad in New York City now.
And you didn't before?
Well, not that I knew of.
See now, it's a whole city to explore,
and my dad is somewhere in there doing dad stuff.
Is that right?
Oh, yeah.
It's kind of strange having a dad you never met before.
I hope he likes me.
Hey…
you should come to New York with me.
Thanks, but no, thanks, friend.
Friend? No one's ever called me their friend before.
-[grunts] -Now you got to come to New York City with me.
Oh, brother.
Search every car.
[gasps] Run.
They're in there somewhere. I smell them.
[groans] Dang it.
-What the heck? -Oh!
-[animals gasp] -[Ruff] My Lord.
What are you guys doing?
-The Beast done found something. -[whoops]
I think we lost them.
We need somewhere to lay low for the night.
Maybe we can rest in that barn over there.
Oh, snaps! I got to get a better look at this.
Arlo, wait.
I'm gonna shave you down like a baboon's bottom.
Don't you threaten me with a good time, honey!

Okay, Teeny Tiny Tony. I'll take a little of that action.
Suckers.

-Huh? -Mister, she's hurt.
I think we need to call a… maybe a barber, I guess?

Edmee would just grab a bowl -and put it on my head… -Hmm?

because your scalp looks like a block of Parmesan cheese.
-There we have it. The hairball wins. -[boos] Thank you very much, folks.
We've been fleeced!
Bamboozled!
Let's stop that darn fur person -and the little con man! -[clamoring]
-[crows] -Come on! Move!
You touch these curls, I will gut you.
-Trim me, honey? Trim you. -[buzzing]
-Give me my money! -Ha!
Hey, green kid, catch!
Meet us at the bus. Run, kid!
-Furlecia, hurry up! -[grunts]
Come on, come on. Let's go. I'm ready to drive this thing.
Wait, did you see a little alligator boy in there?
Oh, yeah. He's right behind us with the--
Alia! Hold up. Wait for the kid.
Arlo!
-Come on! -Get him!
[man] Get him! Get him, guys!
-Ooh! Looks like we got a new challenger. -[Arlo] Uh…
[chuckles nervously] My name's Arlo Beauregard.
I'm from the swamp.
-Y'all hear that? He's one of us. -[clapping]
Hold on now. I'm really from New York City.
New York City?
Hey, Bertie, these guys want to wrestle me.
Why don't you pick on someone twice your own size?
-Alia, keep the engine hot, okay? -[chuckles]
Here comes the cash. Now drive!
Let's go!
Hi, I'm Arlo!
Hang on. I'm coming for you.
-[straining] Take my hand! -[suspenseful music playing]
Ah! I got you!
I can't hold on.
Uh, guys? How's it going out there?
Hang on!
Bertie, you seeing this?
-This tiny train is all tricked out. -[Tony] Hey, hey, you got him.
Thank you very much for your services, young green man.
Now, where's my bag of cash?
Oh! We gave it back to those loud farm people.
Turns out they were still angry after they got it back.
Ba-gooh-ma mia!
Hey, leave the kid alone.
He's just a naive and confused
and misguided and lost little alligator boy. Okay?
And I'm just a giant hairball.
Doesn't mean I don't need money, honey.
Okay, so we gave back your stolen money.
How dare!
We're just trying to survive, lady.
I'm a tiger. Look at me.
Think I can work at a coffee shop? I can't.
I get it, more than you know.
Okay. Well, why don't you get the fact that we were about to be rich
and your kid messed it all up?
Knock it off, Tony.
He doesn't mean it. -Deep down, he's a real softie. -[growls]
And what's your name, sister?
I'm Bertie. And this here is my, uh--
Friend! We're best friends. I'm Arlo.
I'm Furlecia.
-Ah-ha! -This is Teeny Tiny Tony. And Alia up front is our driver.
And I'm on my learner's permit, by the way.
But, uh, I'm super good, so don't worry about a thing. Mmm!
Oh! That sounds safe.
Maybe you can give us a ride.
See, now this is New York City. We're on our way there to meet my dad.
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.
My own teeny tiny papa used to tell me about New York.
[chuckles] Oh… We got family there. In Little Italy.
Rickety biscuit!
Small Tony, you should come with us. You all should.
Maybe you didn't notice, but us three, we got a good thing going here, okay?
We aren't looking for a little charity trip.
Okay, I guess.
Maybe just let us off at the next stop.
-Hey, Arlo, you a good swimmer? -[Arlo] Ooh! [giggles]
Small Tony, I love swimming.
[Tony] It's just Tony, but okay. Maybe we can work something out, huh?
We help you get to New York, and you help us with a teeny-tiny job.
[gasps] Not the aquarium, Tony.
What happened at the aquarium, Teeny Tony?
They got a real good friend of ours locked up there, you know.
Oh, no!
Been in the tank a long time.
Too long!
[gasps] We should rescue him!
No way.
Only problem is there's groupers in that tank with him, mean ones,
and they tried to take a bite out of little Tony last time.
And Furlecia, my sweet Furlecia, she don't like to get wet.
Not with this perm, honey.
That's right. Hey!
-Easy, Bertie. -Nope.
Okay. Well, I guess you don't want a ride to New York.
-[Arlo] Oh, please, please, please! -Ugh.
Fine.
So, that's settled.
Edmee once told me everything happens for a reason.
And lookit! Here we all are.
And once we get there,  the big lady's gonna help us make some more cash.
Keep dreaming, fella.
I like you.
I shouldn't, but I do.
Yo, I'm so excited, you guys!
[Furlecia] Alia, get control of the thing!
[Alia straining] I got it! Oh, my gosh! Whoa! Okay!
Whoo! Yeah! Marcellus, -I'm coming for you, baby! -[all cheer]
[Furlecia] Marcellus, we're comin' for ya!
-[Ruff] What about the alligator boy? -[growls] I ain't gonna tell you nothing.
Oh, you're gonna be telling me.
He might be singing a different tune -once he meets our associate. -[growling] Huh?
-[Beast snarls] -What was that?
Okay, okay, I give.
He went with the others.
They were driving north in a bus.
Is that it?
The kid… The kid said he's going to New York.
What else?
[Stucky] Tell us what his name is.
Uh… His name was, uh…
No one interrogates me but my… -[Beast growls] -[gasps]
Mommy.
-Please, no! Help! Please! -[Beast snarls]
Better tell us his name.
Or else.
-[Stucky laughs] -Please, no! Help!
-[Beast snarls] -[echoes] His name is Arlo Beauregard!
[Tony] Kid, here.
You're gonna need this.
[male voice] What are you doing, alligator boy?
-[Arlo] I came to rescue you! -[man] Oh, I see!
-[loud thud] -[laughs] Free! -I'm free, everybody. Free! -[Arlo] Whoo!
-[all cheering] -[alarm wailing]
Oh, Marcellus, we missed you, dude!
Dancing, huh? [claps] Let's have some fun.
Marcellus in the house! Yes! I missed you so much.
We're back, baby!
-Marcellus, you look good. -Oh, yeah! All right!
-Yeah, I do. -All right.
Hey, that place seemed pretty fun.
What place?
The aquarium. Was it fun?
There was nowhere to hide.
Every day they came.
-Little faces smashed up… -Ah! …against the glass.
Greasy, horrible faces.
-Sticky hands! -[both scream]
Some, they'd come back week after week, month after month.
They'd just stare and eat.
Children are monsters, all of them.
I came from the swamp.
That's right, kid. We all came from the swamp.
[clears throat] Well, buddy, it's great to have you back.
-I'm gonna hit the hay. -[dreamy music playing]
I'll get my beauty sleep in the bus.
Don't bother me. Love you. Bye.
Good night, Bertie.
Bertie?
♪ Good night, Bertie ♪
Oh, right. Good night, Arlo.
-Are you staying up late, Marcellus? -Huh? Wha--
Oh. What do you need, kid? Can't you see I was sleeping?
With your eyes open?
I'm a fish. It's what we do.
[chuckles] Oh, well, good night, then.
Thank you for saving me from the tank.
-Any time. -No!
-Any time. -No! -Never again. -[suspenseful music playing]
-[music stops] -Oh, okay.
Yeah, okay.
-Whatcha doing out here? -Couldn't sleep.
Why not? Those big old waves put me right to sleep.
Yeah, I do love the ocean.
Mmm. Truth is, I'm not really used to staying around the same people for very long,
if you know what I mean.
Not really.
It was just me and Edmee before.
Now I got you, Tony, Furlecia, Alia, Marcellus,
and soon, we'll meet my dad too.
I'm going to make sure you get to your dad safe and sound.
I promise.
But, after that…
I have to keep moving.
But why?
You wouldn't understand.
Sometimes, when I'm in a bad mood or a sad mood or even a happy mood,
I like to sing. It's how I do feelings.
Tell me why you love the ocean.
It's always moving like me.
-I guess it feels like home. -[music brightens]

[Bertie] ♪ Follow me home ♪
[Arlo] Bertie.
I really loved singing with you,
so I found you a little something.
It's a best friend rock. -Do you love it? -[chuckles softly]
Arlo, that's a seashell.
See?
Oh, my word!
Now, we can have matching best friend rocks.
[whispers] I love it.
[Arlo] I can't believe it.
My own dad, Ansel Beauregard, is in one of those big old buildings.
-[Alia gasps] This is crazy, guys. -[ship honks horn]
New York City!
-Wow. -These buildings are everything! This is a city.
-Alia… -Huh? Yeah?
-Aren't you driving the bus? -Yeah.
Should we, uh, buckle our seat belts or…
[laughs] Yeah, yeah. -You probably should. -[thuds]
[both] Hey, I'm walking here!
Hey, I'm walking here!
Walking!
-[New Yorkers] I'm walkin' here! -[tires screech]
[New Yorkers] I'm walkin' here!
New York City.
Rickety biscuit!
Hey, guys, you think I can park here?
Ah, I'm sure it's fine.
[New Yorkers] I'm walkin' here!
All right, I'm walking here.
[shudders] I've imagined this day for so long.
Ba-gooh-ma mia!
Oh, the pepperoni grease. It burns. It burns!
It's what I deserve.
-[cats meowing] -Come here, my little sweetums. You must be hungry.
[chuckles] Oh, lady, I am starving.
[lady] What are you doing? Get out!
-Whoa! -Go on! Get!
Yeah, that's right. -Run. Run for your life. -[child screams]
Oh, ex-- excuse me.
Would you have time to squeeze me in for a blowout?
[Furlecia] Oh, yes! -Work those deft hands! -Ah!
Oh, Dad. Dad!
Lights sure are purty, Stucky.
Yeah.
-[car horns honking] -[woman] Get outta the way, tourists!
Arlo, over here!
Bertie!
Did anyone find any clues about my dad?
No, no, no, no.
But we did lose the bus. So… we got that.
I found $27 in change.
Marcellus, you been in the fountains again?
[munches] You're better than that.
No, I'm not.
It sure would help if we had any idea what he looked like.
There's just too many people.
-Yeah. -[woman] I am here with Ansel Beauregard,
-New York's hottest real estate mogul… -He could be anywhere.
What's your last name, again?
Beauregard. It means beautiful regard. Why?
Well, I don't see the resemblance, but that man on the TV has your name.
[woman] Ansel Beauregard.
-It's such a pleasure to walk with you. -My dad?
You've built some of New York's most ambitious and most luxurious high rises.
Why pick Seaside by the Seashore for your next big development?
Well, Michelle, you see, I grew up here, on this very block. -[glass shatters] -[both gasp]
[chuckles nervously] Nothing to see here. Nothing to see here.
It's so warm. -Uh… -Oh! -[robber] Why is it so warm? -[chuckles]
As you can see, Seaside by the Seashore has, uh…
lost its luster.
But soon enough,
it'll be the most prosperous and tasteful neighborhood -in the whole city of New York. -[fluttering]
I am always looking for ways to transform what is broken into something beautiful,
-and, well… -[cooing] …this project has a special place in my heart.
Now, Ansel, it's been rumored that you'll be revealing your plans
at this year's Met Gala,
New York's biggest social event of the year.
Just to get the chance to share this vision,
it means the world to me.
Well, there you have it.
The man who is transforming New York, one neighborhood at a time.
Did you see that?
You guys, that's my dad. He's amazing.
-Hmm… -Hey, listen, kid.
Want me to find out where he lives?
I probably could call in a few favors from, you know…
the old neighborhood.
[whispers] Yes.
Be right back.
-[grunts] Ow! -[man] Hey, I'm walking here.
Hey! I'm walking here!
Hey, it's Tony.
[man] Hey, hey, it's Tony!
-How's your ma? -All right. Listen, I need a favor.
-[booth opens] -[Tony] Here you go, kid,
the address of one Ansel Beauregard, hot off the streets.
-So… where is it? -Uh…
-I don't know. -It's uptown.
Way uptown.
♪ Gonna find my dad Gonna make him proud ♪
♪ Gonna hug him good Gonna talk real loud ♪
You don't have to sing everything you're thinking.
Sometimes it's nice…
Broadway show! Get your Broadway show here!
Broadway show!
-Ow! [cries] -Get out of my face!
-The kid can't read. -[Ruff] Mm-hmm.
-Looksie what we got here. Beauregard. -[sinister music playing]
He ain't even a little green.
Looks like he's more than a little rich, though.
Seems nice.
I… guess this is it.
Do you all want to come up with me? Uh…
I'm-- I'm sure there's room for everybody.
We made it, Arlo. This next part is all you.
I'll come down as soon as I can, and then--
It's okay, little man. Don't worry about us. We'll be fine.
Thank you. Thank you all.
Bertie… I…
Go… before my eyes start to water.
No squirming.
[Tony] Come on, he's still got to get past the doorman.
Doormen are a tough breed. I know. Trust me.
-Where you goin'? -Hi, I'm Arlo Beauregard.
-I'm here to see my father. -[Tony] Hearts of stone.
He's got no chance of--
So, uh, have you ever thought about a career in amateur wrestling?
Yeah.
[Ansel] Guys, do I have to get my own door again?
-Do you know how heavy this is? -[dramatic music rises]
-[suspenseful music playing] -I… Uh…
You're my dad.
I think you might have the wrong address.
Okay, Dad.
I saw you on the TV, and you were just so warm and generous.
And I just knew it was you. Plus, we have the same last name.
I'm Arlo. Arlo Beauregard.
Oh, boy.
Yep.
I don't mean to be impolite,
but… you see how this is a pretty improbable situation, right?
What is this?
I don't know how you got this, but it's a mistake.
A huge and very terrible mistake.
That's what I thought.
Must have been a big mistake
that I floated all the way down from New York City to the swamp.
Yes. I mean, no.
My son…
My son is gone.
But…
I am not your father.
I can't be.
[gulps] You have to be.
I have nowhere else to go.
And I came all this way.
Look, Arlo…
why don't you come this way? -[hopeful music plays] -Maybe I can help you.
Rickety biscuit.
You know, Arlo, you remind me of a project that I'm working on.
A project?
I know it sounds a little callous, but think of it this way.
See that table over there?
A tiny city.
Oh, Tony would love this.
-[plays hopeful melody] -[Ansel] My old neighborhood of Seaside by the Seashore.
It's run-down and decrepit, dirty and poor,
much like I used to be.
-[rattles] -But no longer, you see.

Ooh! -We are gonna be flying high, Bertie. -[gasps]
[Tony] Bertie?
Hey, you all right, Bertie?
Arlo?
Come on. You cuckoo?
He wouldn't last a second in the ring. He's a sweet kid, though.
What? You don't have to do the wrestling if you don't want to.
-Where you going? -[pleasant music playing]
-Get out of here! Hey, shoo! -[screeching]
Bertie?
Am I…
Are we…
Is this Heaven?
I think it's Brooklyn.
It's…
It's really… trashy.
Hey, hey, hey, come on, kiddo.
Come on, you get bonked on the head or something?
Teeny Tony… [sighs] I'm so sorry.
Yeah, you did get bonked, didn't you? Poor little fella.
-Good luck with that, Berts. -Berts?
-Wait, Tony. -You're gonna be great!
You are gonna say such wonderful things to him.
Arlo, what happened with your dad?
My so-called dad.
Well, turns out he doesn't want me.
Now, I don't even know who I am, and I probably never will.
You are the most genuine person I've ever met.
That's just a nice way of saying I'm different.
Because of you, I think that different is the best thing someone can be.
When I was a little kid… I was just like everyone else,
but as I got older, I just never stopped growing.
I still remember the moment that I realized that people no longer looked me in the eyes,
and eventually, I guess I closed the door on ever letting anyone in.
And then you, Arlo Beauregard, you came crashing right through it.
You're the first person that's ever treated me like a real friend.
That's because you're my best friend.
Best friend in the whole world.
Get a room…
[hesitantly] …to share your feelings…
in private.
Sorry.
So… your dad, he didn't say anything?
He might not even be my dad. And even if he is, he wouldn't admit it.
Arlo, you deserve to know the truth. You know that, right?
I came all this way
and never even got the answers I was looking for.
I'm more lost than ever.
Whoa!
Rickety biscuit!
It's even better than it was on the model.
[Bertie] Wait, you know this place?
It's Ansel's home… or it was.
He's going to tear it down.
[Tony] Shame. This place has got class.
Still warm.
[Arlo] Funny, right? Ansel knows exactly where he came from,
and he's just going to tear the whole thing down.
Me, I got nothing to tear down, I guess.
You know, since you've come into our lives, you've made us all better.
This is true.
Before I met you, all I loved was money.
And pizza pie.
But now, I realize the value in friendship.
Guys, I'm just thinking out loud, but he'll be at the gala tonight.
Maybe this is your chance to find your truth, once and for all.
I don't think I can handle that kind of rejection again.
[Bertie] Arlo…
we got you.
That's right, kiddo.
-Yeah! -Yeah, baby.
The thing about me, I hate confrontation.
You know that, right? Everybody knows that.
But I-- I-- I will go. But if there are kids there,
I'm telling you now, I'm walking right out that door.
I mean, are-- are kids going to be there? Is it a kids' thing?
[reporters] Yo, Kids Thing! Over here! Kids Thing, all right!
Whoo! All right, smile! Turn around!
[reporter] Gorgeous!
Am I in fashion heaven? This is amazing.
I feel underdressed.
Ba-gooh-ma mia! How are we gonna get in there?
-Come here. -[Beast growling] Beast, come over here.
Well, this is pretty dang weird.
[reporters] Over here. Over here! I'm a fish, I need to be caught!
Back off!
-Oh… -[reporter] Love that pose! -Why, thank you. -[dance music playing]
Yes, girl. Work it.
Okay. Well, this is my good side.
-[gasps] Oh, my goodness! -[Beast growling]
-[groans] -[reporters] Yes! Yes! Over here!
-Oh, my goodness! -[snarling, chomps] -[reporters screaming] -[roars]
Wow!
It-- It's like the ancient raves of Egypt.
-Look. -[man] Ladies and gentlemen,
-Look. -[man] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Met Gala,
-fashion event of the year… -[breathes deeply]
Just the most important moment of your life. No big deal.
[man] Welcome to the stage, your host, Ansel Beauregard.
You ready?
-[Arlo] On a mission! Out of the way! -[Ansel] Please. Oh, thank you.
I would not be here today without your approval.
You are… my people.
Let's try that again.
-[crowd cheering] -You… are… my… people!
Wow.
Today, we need to talk about responsibility.
-[crowd exclaims angrily] -No!
Hang on. Hang on.
The responsibility to transform the weak and unsightly
into a paragon of wealth and glamour.
Allow me to reveal my plans for Seaside -by the Seashore. -[music intensifying]
-[Arlo] Hey! -[music slows, stops]
-[crowd gasps, murmurs] -[woman] What?
-[man] What is that thing? -[woman] It's green. Ugh.
That is disgusting! Who are those people?
Um… [chuckles nervously] Hi. Excuse me.
I'm sorry, young man, but can I help you?
I…
[man] Get out of here, you freak!
Uh… I…
I didn't think so.
My dear affluent friends…
Wait, but I…
-…this can only work with your support. -[whispers] Psst. Arlo… sing it.
[Ansel] I need you. We need you. The future of Seaside needs you…

[sniffles] You don't get it, do you?
You showing up here like this,
it puts everything I've worked so hard for at risk.
No, I do get it.
I risked everything to be here.
You're a pretty tough kid, aren't you?
I guess I've gotten that way.
Listen, Mr. Beauregard, if you don't want anything to do with me, that's fine.
I'll leave you alone.
But I just want to know the truth,
so I can stop thinking about it all the time.
Are you my dad?
-Arlo, I'm-- Huh? -[Stucky laughing]
Say, what's the big idea, fellas?
We're working on an emotional breakthrough here.
-We just come for the gator boy. -That's right.
Yeah, we prefer to be out of touch with our emotions.
-[both chuckle menacingly] -Dad?
Arlo…
Stay back, now!
Mister, if you want him back, I'm sure we can work out a price.
But what would you want with a real-life alligator boy?
-It's okay. You don't have to. -[morose music plays]
I don't belong here.
That's what I thought.
Back to the swamp with you, little buddy. You're gonna make us rich.
[Stucky] We got a nice, fun, little cage for you.
What have I become?
-[crowd gasps] -[gasps] Why?
-[Stucky] Move it! Get out of the way! -[sobbing]
Come on, Stucky.
-[grunts] -Arlo?
Arlo!
Bertie?
I love that Beast.
-[cackles] -Bertie?
-What is that? -What the heck?
Consarn it!
What is that? Arlo?
-Look at that. -Arlo?
That's right. [echoing] I'm a bird man.
[man] I love birds, man!
And there is something else you should know.
This amazing young man…
is my son…
…and I have forsaken him.
I have wronged you, Arlo, by trying to bury my past.
As you know, I grew up in Seaside by the Seashore.
It was all right back then.
Still poor, but it had a certain dignity.
-[laughs] -Watch where you're going, bird boy.
The kids were another story.
Hungry?
-[boy] Look at his scrawny legs. -[girl] Eat your seed.
Hey, Ansel, next time we'll get you some nice bread pieces
if you promise not to poop on my dad's car.
-[laughing] -They were mean little twerps.
I swore right then that I'd hide my true self
and dedicate my life to accumulating wealth and power,
hoping that one day,
I'd be powerful enough to tear it all down.
-But then, something happened that… -[crying] …threatened to expose my very existence.
-[cooing] -My son was born… -[sorrowful music playing] -…and… I made the biggest mistake of my life…
when I let him go.
Forgive me… my wonderful alligator boy.
[sniffles] Dad!
Arlo, if you'll give me another chance, I'd love to have you stay with me.
I appreciate it, Dad. I really do.
-[pleasant music playing] -But I've got a whole new family now.
And, well…
-[all] Aw. -…we need each other.
Cool. Cool. No, no, that's cool.
Not like I'm desperately lonely -or… anything. -[Furlecia] Get into this hug, gorgeous!
-or… anything. -[Furlecia] Get into this hug, gorgeous!
-[sentimental music plays] -You know, we traveled all this way just to put that gator boy in a cage.
But frankly,
I had no idea we'd learn all this stuff about the human experience.
I never knew you could learn.
Dang it, Stucky. I love you!
Bertie, I can see now what's been missing this whole time.
It was all of you.
If you aren't ready to stay in one place, we can keep moving.
Maybe all of us together?
I don't need to be anywhere… -[upbeat music plays] -…except with all of you.
Oh my, you're giving me such, like, healing-evolution, glued-together family unit,
water under the bridge moment, and I can't handle it.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said about Seaside by the Seashore.
Instead of tearing it down,
maybe you and your friends would… want to build it back up again.
I don't know… make it your home?

for the sleeping hours brought visions of horror."
"The dark times when those terrible sea beasts
would ravage our shores,
and no ship was safe on the sea."
"But thanks to the hunters, those days are over."
"Today, these valiant warriors battle the beasts far beyond the horizon,
risking their lives to rid the seas of those nightmare creatures."
"And the greatest of the hunting ships is the Inevitable--"
"And the greatest of the hunters is Captain Crow!"
-Yar! -[child] Captain Crow!
[boy] I'm Captain Crow. Smelly old beast!
Hey. [blows]
Who's reading this story?
[matron] Oh my word!
What's this?
Lights-out was an hour ago. Oh, you'll be the death of me.
Come on. Along. Along you pop.
And, Miss Maisie,
the king and queen care for you hunter orphans
out of their kindness.
When you disobey the house rules, you disrespect them.
So we're not going to have any more attempts now, are we?
Absolutely not.
Fair travels, me swabs.
And remember,
live a great life
and die a great death.
-[child 1] Bye-bye, Maisie! -[child 2] We'll miss you!
-[child 1] Bye-bye, Maisie! -[child 2] We'll miss you! [child 3] See you tomorrow!
[woman 1] All hands on deck!
All together now!
Heave away!
Hold your tongues!
-Where'd you see it? -Dead ahead, Jacob.
Are you sure?
Aye, a red tail. Biggest I ever saw. Just under the surface.
Then today is the day.
It's the Red Bluster.
I know it in me bones.
See there!
-Birds follow it. -[birds squawking]
-We come all this way for a proper fight. -And we'll get it, me boy.
It's been 30 years since that thing took me deadlight.
Now I'll have me revenge.
Aye.
[woman 2] Well,
we've passed Rum Pepper Island.
It's heading for the Dregmorr Sea.
If we're gonna do battle
with the greatest and most terrible thing in the sea,
it's best not to wait till after.
There might not be an after.
[woman 1] Haul away, all! Haul, you dogs!
Captain!
It's another hunting ship under attack!
It's Jim Nicklebones' ship.
-It looks like he's found a brickleback. -I'd say it found him.
We have to help him.
[woman 1] What course, Captain?
-We press on. -What?
[Captain Crow] If Jim Nicklebones were half the sea dog he says he is,
he wouldn't be in this mess.
Captain, you know the code.
It binds us to all who come before and all who come after.
And even that rum gagger Jim Nicklebones.
Ms. Merino, set a new course.
Aye, Captain.
Strike the spanker!
Clew up for an' main.
Thirty years I've waited.
Thirty years!
Blast!
[Ms. Merino] Rudder to midship. Come around!
Don't worry. We'll be to the Bluster in no time, Captain.
[woman 2] Drive her down, Mr. Crisp!
It's too much, Captain! We're going down!
[Nicklebones] This is it, mates!
It's been me honor to serve with ya.
[Ms. Merino] Haul away!
By God, it's the Inevitable!
Have at it, Black Bird! [laughs]
Let it know we're here!
We've joined.
We have weather gauge. Shall we draw it upwind?
Aye, and cross the T.
Hard to port, Mr. Crisp!
I'll have her into the wind as high as she'll bear, Ms. Merino!
Furl the main and fore, and ease your headsails, swabbies.
Mainsail haul!
[Jacob] Here we go!
Heads up.
Aim low.
All right, ya fish killers!
We come all this way for a proper fight.
And now, we'll get it!
Nearly there, Captain.
Aye, Sarah.
Now, to port, Ms. Merino. And cross the T!
You heard him, ya lubbers!
Haul your mizzen! Main and fore!
Make it scream, piper!
[man] Here we go!
Fire!
We've not discouraged our prey. Quite the opposite, I'm afraid!
Not to worry, Jacob.
Clew up aloft, Ms. Merino.
[Ms. Merino] Haul away your main and mizzen!
Topsail, clew lines!
-Haul away! -Loose!
It's diving!
Get under the companionway and don't come out till it's settled.
Clever fish.
It's gone upwind.
Stand to. Wait for the word!
[Ms. Merino] You heard the captain! Hands to braces.
Stand by, all!
No birds.
It's smarter than we think. The line's been severed.
-It's below us. -[yelling]
[sailor] Jacob!
Don't worry, lad.
-We got it right where we want it. -Jacob, look out!
Jacob!
Man overboard! Hard to port!
-Haul them lines, ya swabs! -[Ms. Merino] Hard to port!
Time has come, ya devil!
[Jacob] Captain.
-Captain. -[woman] He's coming to.
Captain! Captain!
Captain, the mizzen's in splinters, and I don't like the main.
She can't fight.
Then we'll come back for the Bluster when she can.
-Repairs shouldn't take too-- -Set a course for Three Bridges.
We're going home.
[Mr. Crisp] If you know what's good for ya,
you'll keep clear of the captain.
He was close enough to smell that red devil.
But if he can't have the Bluster's hide, he'll have ours, to be sure.
Why, it's gloomy as the Helgard trenches in here.
[grunts] We've taken some right proper monsters on this hunt,
and the royals will pay us accordingly.
And then we'll come back, and we'll take that red devil.
Can we beat it, Jacob? They say the Bluster moves the very sea.
Aye, and it shoots fireballs out of its eyes, they say.
It's enough to make your knees wobble.
But I ain't afraid, 'cause I'm on the Inevitable with you lot.
This ship has taken more of them beasts than any other,
and she's got the scars to prove it.
As do we, Jacob! [laughs]
Aye.
And every hunter's scar is a life saved.
A merchant sailor on their first voyage.
A mother.
A son.
All hunters die of the same thing.
Aye, being a hunter. [laughs]
That's right. Being a hunter.
But every hunter dies a great death.
Because every hunter lives a great life!
-[Sarah] Jacob! -[music stops]
Captain would like a word.
Speaking of dying a great death.
Nice knowing you, Jacob!
We'll think of you often and fondly. [laughs]
You wanted to see me, Captain?
Sit.
Captain, we'll get the Bluster.
We know where it is now, and you will have your revenge.
I'm… I'm just sorry it wasn't today.
Jacob, I hate that devil with every fiber in me being,
but saving Jim Nicklebones was the right thing to do.
You steered me right today.
Well, I'm… I-I'm glad you see it that way.
So we'll go home, collect our bounty, and repair the ship.
And we'll come back for that beast and bring hell down upon it.
And then what?
What is to become of the Inevitable
after I'm gone?
Through battle and wear,
every beam, block, and spar has been replaced
since the day she was launched.
Yet she lives on.
It's an eternal thing.
But I am not.
Come.
Here is my greatness.
My father's before me,
and his father's before him.
On the day we take the Red Bluster,
I will make me last entry as captain.
Then it'll be your time.
I've known it since the day I pulled you from the sea.
You'd been out there for days.
But there was something in you, Jacob.
A fire that wouldn't die.
Then I held you,
and I knew.
The fates had brought me a son.
And that one day, you would be captain of the Inevitable.
The day you found me,
I swore I would do everything in my power to keep people safe from them demons.
If you would grant me this ship, I would accept,
and it would be my honor.
My boy.
You're gonna do great things.
It's the Inevitable! The Inevitable's back!
-Look! -What a sight!
[boy] Bet she's got a belly full of bones!
[Sarah] It's good to be home at last,
but it will be a short stay, I'm afraid.
Captain Crow will visit the king and queen at first light.
And when the ship is ready,
we'll be off to kill a monster!
-[crowd cheers] -We're going after the Red Bluster!
So if this be our last visit to Three Bridges,
I expect some right, proper debauchery!
[Sarah] Go on, then. Make way for the hunters.
[Sarah] Here we go, mates!
The Crown will pay well for them horns. -So the drinks are on us! -[crowd cheers]
No one goes thirsty tonight, swabbies!
[sailor] Come on, then!

Hello!
Hello.
Me name's Maisie.
Maisie Brumble.
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
And you're Jacob Holland, who once killed four of them beasts in a span of two days.
who once killed four of them beasts in a span of two days.
Is it true you done that?
Four in two days?
Don't believe everything you hear, lass. Four in two days? [scoffs]
It was five.
I heard…
I heard there was a time them beasts used to come right up to shore,
pluck a lady right out of her veggie patch,
and swallow her up!
But not no more. And it's 'cause of the hunters.
There's not a nobler profession, I says.
I come from a long line of hunters meself.
Is that so?
Aye. Me parents were lancers. They served on the Monarch.
The Monarch.
-So they're… -Aye.
That's just the way for a hunter, ain't it?
You live a great life and die a great death.
Huh. Come on.
So, uh, who's looking after you then?
I'm staying at a children's home in Guelston, up the way.
Except I ain't staying exactly.
I'm on the run, you see.
And I ain't going back.
'Cause I'm joining your crew.
[chuckles] Oh, no, you ain't. A hunting ship ain't no place for a kid.
You joined the ship when you were me age, and look at you now.
You're a weapon against nature's darkest design.
It says so on page 92.
Look, kid, I'm clever with a spear, but I've been lucky more than once.
There's no guarantee of making it to page 92.
Trust me.
Now, you should run along.
Right, then. I'll talk to Captain Crow. That's a man with real authority. [grunts]
Do you know where I might find Captain Crow?
Hey! I… I have authority.
-All right? -You ain't captain, are ya?
Uh, no, but I am captain material.
[laughs] "Captain material?"
-Sorry. It just sounds funny. -I mean, I will be captain.
-Someday. -Well, I intend to get on that ship.
So, if you don't mind,
I'll take it up with Captain Now,
not Captain Someday.
Hey! Put me down! Let me go!
Monster hunters are supposed to be heroes.
[Jacob] And here's me saving you.
Evening, Rosie. You go through Guelston?
Aye.
Right. Let her out there and not before.
-If that's not too much trouble. -Aye.
Hey! [grunts]
This is kidnapping!
-[Jacob sighs] -New friend, Jacob?
Ah, just some kid.
Urgh. Horrible things, children.
[Jacob] You can say that again.
Well, if it isn't Captain Crow and his loyal mates.
Your Grace, as you can see, the oceans have offered abundant prey.
And I see you've taken a full-grown brickleback.
A specimen like that garners quite a bounty.
But there's something I don't see.
The horn of the Red Bluster.
Admiral Hornagold has reported a rumor…
[all] Admiral Hornagold?
…that you spotted the Red Bluster, but abandoned your pursuit
because of a certain code.
The royals don't pay you to honor such codes.
They pay you to kill monsters.
How many more ships will be lost because you let the Bluster slip away?
[king] This was once a small kingdom with a big idea.
To send hunters out to repel the beasts from our shores
and usher in a new era of peace.
It's been hundreds of years since the dark times,
but as long as the Bluster lives,
people will still look to the seas with fear.
So today marks the beginning of a new era.
The Crown will no longer support the hunters.
She's quite a sight, isn't she?
The Imperator is the most heavily-armed ship ever to set sail.
The Royal Navy will push deep into the unknown world
and eradicate every sea beast in our path.
Not in that thing.
She rests too low.
And them fixed cannons is useless.
And her Captain is an ass.
[gasps] It's time for you to leave, Captain.
Your time is up.
Admiral, have you ever seen one of them beasts that wasn't hanging from a ceiling?
Don't send your soldiers to die in a ship like that.
It's not built for hunting,
and neither are you.
I assure you, I am not afraid of those beasts.
Then you're a fool!
And you'll take a lot of good sailors down with you!
General, see the hunters out. We're done with them.
We hunters have shed blood, while you lot hid behind walls
and drew lines on maps.
You're cowards, the lot of ya!
General, the Captain is to be placed under arrest,
and the Inevitable decommissioned.
W-W-Wait, wait!
Uh, Your Grace. [chuckles nervously]
The, uh… The Captain is well-known for his temper,
but his talents as a hunter have served you well.
He's opened the seas
and made your empire the envy of the known world.
Now, I believe the world still needs the hunters,
so prove me wrong.
Give us one more try for the Bluster.
If we take it, you keep your promise, and we continue our alliance.
If the Imperator takes the Bluster,
well, you can tear down the Inevitable for scrap,
and the days of the hunters will be over.
Either way,
you win.
I, for one, would relish the opportunity.
Then we have a contest.
Get set.
Go.
We'll take the Bluster and bring it to your doorstep.
The days of hunters are not over.
Not nearly.
When we reach the Dregmorr, we'll follow the trenches.
We stay battle-ready, clear decks, sharpened flints, and fresh cartridge.
The Bluster's hide will be plenty thick.
-Best to use the long spears. -[indistinct shouting]
[Sarah] Them archers won't do any good, but we've got plenty of carcass shot.
[Captain Crow] We'll hit it with fire, then go for a sleigh ride.
That's the way with something like this.
[Jacob] We're ready, Captain. We'll take that red demon.
For we are hunters.
And we will bring all of our skill
and all of our rage down upon this beast.
And there will be justice!
But that will not be the end of this great ship.
For no one has sailed beyond the Dregmorr Sea.
No one knows what dangers lurk
in that terrible unknown.
But it will be this ship,
under Jacob Holland, that will pierce the darkness.
So let's drink to a successful hunt, with many more to come.
-[Maisie] Ow! -[sailor 1] What was that?
-[sailor 2] It came from the keg. -[sailor 3] What was that?
You stowed away?
I stowed away.
[sighs] You stowed away.
Uh, I…
Yeah.
Well, we're dropping you off at the nearest port.
We're going after the Bluster. -We can't have a kid mucking about. -[Captain Crow] What's this?
-We can't have a kid mucking about. -[Captain Crow] What's this?
The name's Maisie Brumble,
but you need no introduction.
You've been swallowed whole,
shot through the heart, and cut to pieces.
But the worms won't eat you, and hell won't take you, so here you are!
The right, proud commander of the second-greatest hunting ship
what ever sailed.
Second-greatest?
Which then, may I ask, is the greatest?
I'm partial to the Monarch,
for it's the ship me parents served on.
I see.
Then they died heroes, didn't they?
Aye.
I like this kid.
-She's all vinegar. -But, C-Captain--
Sarah, be good enough to take her in, would you?
Aye, Captain.
Congratulations, Captain Someday.
Sleep there.
You're… Sarah Sharpe.
They say no first mate is more loyal than--
[Sarah] That's enough.
I've heard your speeches, Miss.
My speeches kept me on this boat.
You're on this boat because Captain Crow won't stop to put you off it.
The hunt is all.
So give him your absolute obedience.
Or fall on that yourself,
because I'll visit worse than death on ya.
You're amazing.
We passed Rum Pepper Island in the night.
We've reached the Dregmorr.
Aye, and we'll find that thing soon enough.
I wonder if I might need something a little… larger?
Hey, where'd you get that knife?
Sarah gave it to me, 'cause I'm a hunter now.
-A hunter who needs to go to bed. -But I'm too much awake to sleep.
I'm on the Inevitable with Captain Crow.
Them pictures in me books come to life,
and exacting bloody revenge!
Go, get your rest.
Aye, Captain. [chuckles]
We's gonna kill that thing, ain't we?
And they'll make statues of us.
We'll kill it, all right. Now get!
The monsters, I can handle.
But that one, she'll be the death of me.
You'll recall the hunter's code binds us to all who come before
and all who come after.
I see a fire in her.
Same fire I saw in you.
Beat to quarters!
Let's have her ready!
Today's the day we do what we do!
Fighting trim! Clew up fore a' main!
Harpooners, tie off them darts! We're going for a sleigh ride!
[Ms. Merino] Heave away!
Brace!
The ocean has sent us its worst, and we'll send it right back.
Carcass shot if you please, gunners!
Protect our broadside.
All right, ya fish killers!
We come all this way for a proper fight and--
[Maisie] Jacob!
What's happening?
Maisie, get back to your room!
-[gasps] -Go.
Stay away from the window.
Hurry, lad!
Fire!
Now's our chance! Spears!
We got it hooked. Now we'll wear it down.
Full sail, Ms. Merino!
[Ms. Merino] Square the yards! Get it off the pins!
[Captain Crow] It'll fight the very wind till there's no fight left in it.
Run, ya devil! And there we'll be!
[Sarah] Captain?
[grunts] We've got you now.
The ship can't take it.
We have to cut the lines.
I've never run from a fight, and I won't start now.
We must!
Even dead, it'll drag us to the bottom!
Time has come for ye, ye devil.
Maisie Brumble, cut those lines, and I'll kill you for a coward!
Jacob, stop her!
Jacob!
-[Jacob panting] -[Captain Crow] Bring her to me!
-[Jacob] What are you gonna do? -I said bring her to me!
-She's just a child. -I'm giving you an order!
Please, Captain.
Bring… her… to… me.
Jacob!
Are we gonna die in here?
No.
Well, yeah.
Is it gonna chew us,
or will we get digested slowly with acids?
I don't know, Maisie. This is all new territory for me.
Haven't you hunted these things your whole life?
We kill 'em, lass. We don't study 'em.
I guess it's time to start.
Jacob, what if it swallows you?
Cut the rope.
-What are you going to do? -I'm gonna kill it.
Kill it? How?
Well, I don't know. I just get pumped up and kind of wing it.
I don't want to overthink this, all right? I'm just gonna kill it.
I don't know about this.
I'm Jacob Holland, remember,
who killed five of them beasts in the span of two days.
And this is just another beast.
There has to be another way!
Afraid not, lass.
Well, c-can you kill it from the inside?
Hold on, lass.
-[Maisie] Jacob! -[Jacob strains]
No, wait!
W-W-Wait, Jacob! No!
Stop!
Oh bloody hell.
[Maisie] You could've killed me!
Wha… I could have killed you?
You got it backwards, lass.
I had it dead to rights, and you bollocksed it up.
Dead to rights?
I must have been watching a different fight.
We wouldn't have been fighting at all if you hadn't cut them lines.
We cut them lines.
No, you cut them lines.
You didn't stop me, did ya?
That's not the same thing.
Isn't it?
No, it isn't.
We'd best find shelter.
Get your strength.
We're leaving in the morning.
Me book says the beasts used to come right up to shore.
That nowhere was safe.
Is that true?
Of course it's true.
You saw it?
It was before my time, but everyone knows it's true.
What if them things ain't as bad as they say?
I mean, the sea is their home.
We went after her, didn't we?
What if we just left 'em alone?
We kill them because they kill us.
Do I need to remind you that one of them things took your parents?
Should they have just left the monsters alone?
I… don't know.
Oh, you are lost, girl.
Your parents died heroes.
I want to believe that,
but maybe you can be a hero and still be wrong.
-You're not making-- -[growling]
-You're not making any sense. -Why did Red swallow us?
Oh, "Red," is it?
She, not it.
I think it's a she, and I think she was protecting us from Crow.
You're giving that beast way too much credit.
-He was pointing a gun at you, and he– -He was pointing it at you, through me.
Because you cut them lines.
I don't wanna argue about it, all right?
'Cause I don't want to attract any of the multitude of monsters
on this island,
that, that I wouldn't be on if you hadn't cut them lines!
So we're not arguing?
So what are we doing?
I'm going to gather supplies.
I'll take you to Guelston, and when I get back to the ship,
we'll finish what we started.
Don't… get killed out there.
[Jacob] I won't make any promises.
Jacob.
Promise.
All right.
I promise.
[Sarah] Captain,
the beast is gone.
We can't stay out here.
[Captain Crow] That thing took Jacob.
And I want it dead same as you,
but we'll founder if we don't get to port.
She's making more water than we can pump out.
And the patch we fothered keeps slipping.
If we stay out here much longer, we'll be sunk.
[sighs] Shape a course for Mukesh Island.
-But the closest port is– -Mukesh!
It'll be Mukesh by thunder, or the ocean floor.
Would you be planning a visit to Gwen Batterbie, by any chance?
Captain, her wares come at too steep a price.
To make covenant with the likes of her is against the hunter's code.
Blast whatever code would bar me my revenge!
There be no charter over me own.
I'll use Batterbie's methods. I'll do whatever it takes.
I'd cleave the very sea
and destroy everything that swims, scuttles, or bobs if I have to.
But I'll have vengeance.
I'll have vengeance.
[Ms. Merino] Trim the sails for a new course! Keep her full and by!
-Hey, little guy. -[creature squeals]
[chuckles] These things ain't so bad.
What are you doing?
[Maisie] I, uh…
I'm afraid anything I say will upset you.
You're probably right.
Just don't move.
[Maisie] I'm sorry,
but I've always wanted a pet.
That's not a pet.
It's a monster, and we're not keeping it.
But I already named it.
Let me guess.
Blue.
You named that one Red. You named this one Blue.
We stay much longer, and we'll have a rainbow of critters that wanna eat us.
But he's so cute!
Look at this face.
You and I have a different idea of cute.
[Maisie] No!
When we get to Guelston,
I'll get you a cat, and you can name it Grey or White.
Ginger, if you like.
You're too young to be this mean.
And you're too old to be giving in to childish temptations.
It ain't childish to want a pet.
Lots of people have pets.
Not pets that will lay eggs in your mouth
that hatch and burst out through your chest cavity!
That is so specific.
Well, I seen some things, all right?
Point is we don't know what he'd do.
We don't know anything about this island,
except we've got to get off it, by thunder!
Best be going.
Maybe they're bonded to us, like geese.
It's the mother goose I'm worried about.
There she is. Come on, lass.
Hold the rudder.
If we can make it to Rum Pepper Island, we'll be able to flag a ship.
The Dregmorr is thick with monsters, but don't worry.
If there's one of them things within a mile of us, I'll sense it.
May be a little off my game here.
[Maisie] Jacob!
Hold on, Maisie!
Maisie.
Maisie?
Maisie!
Maisie!
Good boy.
We have to go back.
-We'll never make it! -[Jacob] Depends on how fast you can bail.
Maybe Red can take us!
Back to the island?
No, back home!
You have really lost it.
She saved us from that thing, didn't she?
[Jacob] Wait… She…
Are you…
I think I did the saving, right?
I mean, I threw the, the… Get bailing! The water's coming in!
Hey!
Red!
-See this little guy? -[Blue squeaks]
This is you.
You're wasting your time.
And this is me.
And this is him.
Are you putting on a puppet show? We're sinking here.
We need to get way over there.
And I wonder if you might be good enough to take us?
Well, if she does understand ya, she don't wanna help.
Bright side? She didn't eat ya.
Now, get bailing.
I told you she was more than a beast!
The world is wide, Jacob.
And you don't know everything.
[Jacob] With the right heading, we'll be there in three days.
[grunts] All right, beast. I need you to turn.
Okay? Can you turn?
Can you turn to starboard, yeah?
To the right.
Right, ya dumb beast. Right.
-Can you turn to the right? That way! -You can scream all day.
She don't understand ya.
Oh, she understands, all right.
She's just being monstrous.
[Jacob] I need you to turn to the starboard.
Over there, right where I'm pointing? That's starboard. That's the right.
More to the right. Look, see? Over there, right!
Turn to the right, you infernal bloody sea beast!
He's wondering if you might turn a smidge.
Like this, see?
[Maisie] That's it!
Thanks, girl! [giggles]
Not so hard.
She ain't no pet. Just don't let your guard down, all right?
[sighs] You can relax, Captain. She's a friend.
-Yeah, right. Till she gets hungry. -Oh, will you just…
-[man 1] Is that the Inevitable? -[man 2] What are they doing here?
Captain!
We don't need this. We're hunters.
Only if we kill it.
[Gwen] I know why you're here, Captain.
It's always the same reason, you see.
And I can give you what you need.
A poison powerful enough to take down the greatest of beasts,
and a weapon strong enough to deliver it deep.
You know what they say about me, Captain?
Them what come see Gwen Batterbie get what they want,
but won't see a good day after.
Yet, here you are.
I don't believe in them superstitions.
No, I don't suppose you do.
But you will.
It's me most terrible creation.
The Hand of God, I calls it.
What will it cost me?
Everything, Captain.
I take everything.
So, do we have a deal?
Yeah, well, you know, I'm, uh… I'm used to a bigger target, all right?
It says here that during the dark times,
the beast destroyed a town on the coast of Kra' Zoul.
But we been up and down that coast, and I ain't never seen no town,
destroyed or otherwise.
A-And… And we don't say "yar" half this much.
E-Every other page, we're shouting "yar."
I mean, this is just nonsense.
Says you.
But the book says otherwise,
and it's going to outlast both of us.
So people will believe the beasts destroy towns that don't exist,
and hunters like to say "yar."
But if that ain't true,
then how are you supposed to know what is?
[Maisie] And how do we know the sea beasts
ever plucked ladies out of their veggie patches?
That there really were the dark times?
Maybe they didn't start this war.
Maybe, but
why would we?
Looks like a real shipwrecker.
Nicer down here, I'd say.
Aye.
Nicer down here.
I don't know how the war started.
Maybe all that matters is how it ends.
It's a blood moon.
Batterbie's watching.
Honor is the currency of hunters, it is.
And dealing with her ain't honorable.
Aye. There'll be a payment due,
and it's the ship and all aboard who'll suffer the cost.
[Captain Crow] Sarah!
Look there.
Riddlebacks.
Aye.
They don't come this far north.
Not unless they're swimming away from something.
And there's only one thing what scares a riddleback.
The Bluster.
Ms. Merino, shape a new course. Due south, if you please.
Alee of Rum Pepper Island.
Aye, captain. You heard him! Get it off the pins!
Haul away now!
Haul away, all!
We'll find you.
We'll find you soon enough.
That ain't you no more.
You're not Jacob Holland who killed four of them beasts
in a span of two days.
It was five.
You're Jacob Holland who befriended a beast,
saved me life,
and led us all the way to Rum Pepper Island.
We made it.
This is as far as Red goes.
Won't be safe for her beyond the Dregmorr,
but we can flag a passing ship.
And then what?
Well, then I'll, uh, take you to Guelston, won't I?
And what about you?
Guelston is a place.
It ain't a family.
I ain't going back there, and you ain't going back on that ship.
So all you have is me.
And all I have is you.
And that don't sound so bad.
So, what do you say?
Should we give it a go?
You mean, uh…
You mean, like a family?
Sure.
I-I don't know.
Maybe if we pretend long enough, it could feel real?
Never mind. It's stupid.
What, are you picturing us on a farm or something?
I said "never mind," ya donkey.
So never mind.
It's just I-I don't think I'm--
You got something in your ears?
All right, all right.
Well, guess, uh, we'd better pack up.
Well, girl, this has been an improbable adventure.
And I thank you for all you've done, but, uh,
it's time to go home now.
And I promise I'll never hunt sea monsters again.
No more monster hunting!
Hang about.
[panting] Okay.
No more!
No more! [grunts]
Jeez!
[sighs] Look, you understand the point I'm trying to make here, right?
It's a… It's a symbolic gesture.
-I think she understands. -[Blue squeals]
[Jacob] All right, then.
Time to go home.
Go on, girl. Go home.
Red?
Red!
Oh no.
[man] Need a hand here.
[Jacob] Red, listen to me.
Just leave.
This doesn't have to be a fight.
-[Red growls] -[Jacob] No, Red. Go.
-Go on, Red. Just leave them be. -Red, we have to go. Please!
No, Red! No!
All hands, to arms!
[man] Fire away!
Maisie!
No, Red! Stop!
Maisie!
[Jacob] Maisie!
Are you all right, lass?
Is Red okay?
Hold fast!
Stay back, beast. Leave her be.
It's the Red Bluster.
The beast is delivered!
No, lass.
There's nothing to be done.
She doesn't have to do this.
Yes, she does.
Ready the Hand of God!
[Captain Crow] Now is the reckoning.
For all who've been lost,
I strike at thee, devil!
Don't fight.
You'll make the poison flow faster.
I don't want you to die. Not yet.
Not till you've been immortalized at Castle Whiterock.
Captain, might be wiser to let the poison finish the job.
No, Sarah.
I made a promise to the king and queen.
But I'd not worry.
There's no fight left in it.
Yes, there is.
Raise the studding sails!
To starboard, Captain. It's a boat!
Hold!
By the powers…
Jacob.
[Captain Crow] I see.
That's quite a story, Jacob.
The hunter what befriended a beast. Hmm.
The beast what took me deadlight.
What am I to make of ye, Jacob?
That thing and I,
we, uh, had, uh,
an understanding.
A truce. Hmm?
But there cannot be a truce without war.
Whatever happened out there is nothing against hundreds of years of war.
I've always known what I was, Jacob.
I'm the son of a captain, who was the son of a captain.
And if we are born to fight, then by God, let's fight.
That we may be tested and find our greatness.
So I ask you, Jacob, my son,
are you my enemy?
Let her go!
She's all vinegar.
Easy, lass. Easy. There you go.
You need to help Red.
She's our friend.
I'm sorry.
She needs her rest.
I'll get you back to Guelston.
You'll be safe.
You'll have a good, long life.
But first, we'll pay a visit to Castle Whiterock.
We have a date with the king and queen.
Jacob, I imagine you could use a drink.
[sailor] Welcome home, lad.
Good to see ya.
So good to see you.
[Captain Crow] You're home, Jacob.
Let's toast to the many adventures that lay ahead of you,
Let's toast to the many adventures that lay ahead of you, as captain of the Inevitable.
You're getting your strength back.
Too late.
Maybe.
It's not right what they're doing to Red.
She saved us.
You have to believe me, please.
I believe you.
Then help me stop them.
I've been fighting them beasts all me life,
and I've seen things that will never go away.
This ship is all I know.
No first mate more loyal than Sarah Sharpe.
Crow's done it! He got the Bluster!
The whole world will know what we've done, me boy.
This ship, your ship, will live on.
Nothing can stop it.
-[Blue splutters] -[Maisie gasps] Blue! [giggles]
Let's see a cat do that.
[villager] Open the gate!
It was them!
Oh, girl.
Don't worry, Red. I-I'll get you out of here.
[queen] What is all this?
Why is everyone… [gasps]
He's done it! He's got the Red Bluster!
-That'll do, Ms. Merino. -[Ms. Merino] You heard the captain.
Drop anchor.
Captain Crow.
Well, it looks like we have our winner.
When I last visited Whiterock,
you told me that the days of hunters were over.
But the Imperator was no match for the beast.
All of your wealth and power,
all of this is nothing compared to a hunter's fury.
And it's the Inevitable what will lead the way
into the Dregmorr and beyond.
Until the bones of every one of them beasts
lies at the bottom of the sea!
[Jacob] Captain!
Jacob,
get back on the ship.
I can't let you do it.
You dishonor me, boy.
As you dishonor all them hunters what come before.
All them what died heroes.
Aye, they were heroes.
But you can be a hero
and still be wrong.
Now give me the lance.
I thought of you as a son.
But I don't know you.
I gave you everything!
I gave you life!
You've laid down your lance
and think it's made you strong?
But you've turned your back on your own kind.
-Jacob! -Jacob!
I should have given you a bigger knife.
The hunters brought the beast to the very heart of our kingdom.
For your queen, for all that is good,
strike it down!
Cannoneers! Take position!
[soldier] Prepare to fire!
Out of our way, you fools!
[Maisie] Stop!
If you do this, it never ends.
No more monster hunting! [grunts]
Impossible.
You did good, kid.
I ain't done.
[Maisie] Our books,
our history,
is a lie.
I don't believe the beasts ever threatened our shores.
It was just a story.
A story told by them!
-[queen gasps] -[king] What?
For generations, they've taught us to hate the beasts
and sent the hunters out to destroy them.
And the beasts learned to fear us and hate us,
and they fought back!
Who are you to malign your king and queen with such falsehoods?
You have no right to speak!
I have every right!
I come from a long line of hunters that died your great death!
Your kingdom was paid for with their blood,
and their blood!
Enough! General, give the command.
This war was started by the kings and queens what come before.
And with every lie, their empire grew.
Now this lot stands on the same perch and tells the same lies.
For their greed.
General!
Let it end.
Let it end!
[child] Listen to her!
Let the beast go!
Listen to the child!
Now I'm done.
All right, Red.
We best go.
What are you doing?
Fire!
Your queen demands it!
General, shouldn't we fire?
My brother was on the Monarch, Sergeant.
And I want to know how this war started.
That hurt, didn't it?
You have no idea.
[Maisie] Two lives were saved that day.
One man and one beast.
And with that, the world began to change.
No ship would ever sail the Dregmorr again.
And the mysteries beyond would remain undisturbed.
[Maisie] I don't think about it much though.
Red is safe, and I have everything I need right here.
I'm going to live a great life.

OF THE USA IN THE SOUTH AND USSR IN THE NORTH.
ON JUNE 25, 1950, THE KOREAN WAR BROKE OUT CAUSING MORE THAN 3 MILLION CASUALTIES.
EVEN AFTER THE ARMISTICE,
A COLD WAR REIGNED WITH BOTH SIDES SENDING COUNTLESS SPIES OVER THE BORDER.
THIS FILM IS BASED ON THE REAL-LIFE CASE OF "BLACK VENUS"
WHO OPERATED AS A SPY IN THE 1990S.
ALL CHARACTERS AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTIONALIZED
AND MAY DIFFER FROM REAL EVENTS.
KIM IL SUNG DIES
NORTH WITHDRAWS FROM NONPROLIFERATION TREATY
North Korea, responding to the IAEA's demand
for inspections of the Yongbyon Nuclear Reactor,
has announced its withdrawal from the NPT.
Both South Korea and the US called emergency meetings,
deciding on firm countermeasures against the North,
as the Korean peninsula plunged deeper into crisis.
Get him!
Hey. Hey!
What's going on?
Let go of me!
What are you doing?
Mr. Hwang Byung-chul?
-What is this? -Don't move!
Who are you?
I handle foreign operations for the NIS.
You'll have to come with me.
-Why are you doing this? Who are you? -Get him!
Let go!
In January 1992,
an NIS agent asked me to spy on the North.
He said stopping the North
from developing nuclear weapons was the only way to save Korea,
so I agreed to become a spy.
From that day on, I had to become a new man.
I drank every day
and gambled frequently.
I had to erase my former self as a military officer.
Here's ten million won.
I borrowed from old comrades, supposedly to start a business.
You never used to drink. Now day drinking? What's gotten into you?
And why did you quit the defense agency?
You could've been promoted to lieutenant colonel in no time.
You be a colonel.
I'd rather be a company chairman.
Thanks a million!
After borrowing from here and there,
my debt snowballed in no time,
and finally my credit was ruined.
WARNING RESTRICTED MILITARY AREA
It was all to mislead any spies from the North and wipe my identity.
It was my first mission.
Bye.
My second mission as a spy was to bring
physicist Kim Jang-hyuk, who knew key facts on the North's nuclear program,
to South Korea safely.
MARCH 1993, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE FOREIGN AFFAIRS INTERROGATION ROOM
What the hell is going on here?
Sit.
Mr. Hwang Byung-chul.
As you know, we're facing a major crisis because of nukes in the North.
I know nothing about that.
You probably don't.
But your professor Kim Jang-hyuk knows very well about it.
Lately, he's visited Pyongyang often for that very reason.
By the way,
what happened to the friend I was with?
Are you aware he's a spy sent by the North?
Even if you didn't know,
in South Korea, you can be deported just for meeting a North Korean spy.
And if the matter is serious,
you can be punished under the National Security Law.
I can't believe this.
Then…
What should I do?
I know you're quite busy. Thank you for coming all this way.
What are you talking about?
How could I turn down your invitation?
It's true I'm here for the symposium, but the real reason is to see you.
Thank you so much.
Let's go, then.
Please sit in your assigned seats for the Symposium
of Northeast Asia Promotion of Peace and International Cooperation.
Professor?
Hi.
Let me introduce you to an important person before the symposium starts.
Ready for cleaning. Close the windows.
There is a fire alarm in the hallway.
Please use the nearest emergency exit to evacuate.
I repeat.
Please use the nearest emergency exit…
Yes, I am a nuclear physicist.
But I work for a Chinese university,
so I know nothing about matters in Pyongyang.
A nuclear physicist who's visited Pyongyang 26 times over the past year
doesn't know about the nuclear program?
It's hard to believe.
I'd better go now.
The symposium is about to start.
You don't need to attend the symposium.
This entire symposium was nothing but a front to bring you here.
Have a drink.
I hear your university pays you only 45 dollars a month.
I believe you're worth more than that.
If you cooperate,
I'll pay you 100,000 dollars right away to express our gratitude.
It's 200 years' worth of my salary.
You've got my attention,
but I can't tell you what I don't know.
I hear your wife worries about your kids' university admissions.
We can help with that as well.
Helping my children, or 100,000 dollars. I should choose between the two?
Your children's schools, and 100,000 dollars.
Two for the price of one.
The nuclear program was boosted after the Eastern Bloc fell in 1989.
Based at the Science Academy in Pyongsong,
the research was overseen by Kim Chaek University researchers.
So now, four years later…
You ask if North Korea is developing nuclear power?
They're not developing it.
They already have the technology.
You mean the North already has nuclear weapons?
Whether weapons exist is
a top secret only known by high-ranking officers
in Bureau 131 that's under the direct command of Kim Jong Il.
They say it's for energy,
but if they can enrich plutonium, weaponizing is just a matter of time.
Your next job
is to infiltrate the North Korean elite and see what they're up to.
The NK External Economic Committee, in Beijing.
The director is Ri Myong Un.
He's a top graduate of Kim Il Sung University
and handles all the North's foreign currency trading.
He's not affiliated with military or security, so he has no rank.
But his influence in the North is unimaginable.
He's the only person we can approach who meets Kim Jong Il privately.
To approach him, disguise yourself as an international businessman.
Only three people including me know your real identity.
It's going to be a solitary fight.
Can I ask who the other two people are?
Me, the NIS Chief, and…
On the day that Pyongyang falls,
I'll meet you by Taedong River.
INFILTRATING THE NORTH KOREAN ELITE VIA EXTERNAL ECONOMIC COMMITTEE
4. OBTAINING INFO ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS
TO BE REFERRED TO ONLY BY CODE NAME: BLACK VENUS
MARCH 1995, BEIJING TRADITIONAL MARKET
I've lost many good NIS agents in Beijing and Dandong for the past two years.
Some kidnapped to the North,
and some murdered in cold blood.
You need to be a perfect salesman.
Anything wrong with your facial expression, clothes, or behavior,
and the enemies will find you out at once.
You said you’re from Masan, South Gyeongsang Province?
Ta-da!
Take a look!
You'll never find products like these anywhere else.
It wasn't easy stocking so many!
MACHINE GUN
Pull the trigger on this beauty to hear its true worth.
Here.
Shut up, or I'll blast you to bits!
And it even has a second stage attack!
I'll incinerate you, capitalist pigs!
What do you think?
Kiyohara Hisashi, an ethnic Korean from Japan.
Probably the only route to approach External Economic Committee of NK.
What about the NIS' contacts in Beijing?
This is a contact planted by our White Agents.
He's ethnic Chinese, so he knows a lot and will help you with anything.
Everyone calls him Dr. Jang.
He's said to be close with North Korea,
but since he's driven by profit, neither North nor South really trusts him.
So my only option is to use Kiyohara to approach them?
That all depends on you.
Wait!
How about some Mt. Sindok mineral water?
It's filled with ions and amino acids.
Great for health!
Great, my ass!
You think after three months of running around in Beijing,
I'll go back with a bunch of kids' toys?
Would you buy that for your kid?
Who's the one getting screwed here?
There are no borders with toys.
In Pyongyang, these are completely sold out!
Are you an idiot?
Get me something I can slap a fake tag on, asshole!
Things like cigarettes or cars!
First,
if you buy all those toys, then I'll set you up.
You ungrateful bastard…
How many drinks have I bought you?
Look, Kiyohara.
You're out. Beat it.
Wait!
Wait!
Hey, Mr. Kim!
Don't you know anyone else around here?
I'm about to blow my top.
I can't find North Korean products anywhere.
The traders here are all small fry.
There's no money in it.
Just pocket change.
The streets here are filthy. I hate the food.
It's driving me crazy.
Damn, you know how it is.
I'm loaded with cash.
I can pay the admission fee,
but I can't find anyone to sell me a ticket!
Give me that.
I'm buying something. I'll call you back.
It's a real Rolex!
It's a great product.
MILLENNIUM HOTEL, BEIJING
God, I'm tired.
I spent the whole day looking at samples.
Yes.
What are you talking about?
I came here to work. I have no time to do that. You think I'm lying?
Yes, I'm thinking things over.
If nothing works out, I'll just go back.
The handover of Hong Kong is in a couple years.
-I can try my luck there. -How long will it take?
A couple weeks at most.
A couple weeks?
Is that really possible?
Of course.
If you find any leads, let me know, Mr. Kim.
We'll keep in touch by phone.
All right.
I'll call you then.
Wrap things up well this time, okay?
God, when I think of that Bolshoi performance--
Chairman.
Don't worry too much.
-All right, then. -Okay.
We'll talk later. Bye!
Good luck!
It's been six months since I contacted Kiyohara,
who is close to the External Economic Committee.
I still haven't met any senior North Korean officials.
But today they started bugging my room,
and the hairs I placed around the room were moved.
It's a sign that senior officials have been told about me.
An intelligence officer turned rich businessman.
It's time to throw those cash-starved Northerners some irresistible bait.
INCHEON HARBOR, PIER 4
It's Lunar New Year, so we're running low.
Half walnuts and half jujube.
Yes, 400,000 dollars' worth.
They must be from North Korea.
I'll fax you an official purchase order.
Yes.
Hello, is this the news channel?
I've got something to report.
Agricultural goods disguised as North Korean products
are increasingly being smuggled into the country through Incheon.
Chinese products with North Korean packaging
are being imported under…
Hey, ma'am. Is this kimchi from Korea?
We made it ourselves.
This is Pacific Industries.
Good day? You think this is a good day?
Have you seen the news report?
You sent us Chinese goods claiming they were North Korean.
Now the shipment is seized, and we're about to go bankrupt.
And you say "good day"?
First, if you process the payment,
we'll resend the shipment and make sure it's all North Korean.
Have you gone mad?
I'm not paying unless you send a new shipment!
Hello?
What did he say?
This is bad. If we don't pay the Chinese suppliers,
they're sure to report us to the police.
"SELF-RELIANCE IDEOLOGY IS OUR LIFE." - KIM JONG IL
Count it properly, okay?
-Freeze! -Who are you?
-Arrest him! Get them all! -I'm sorry.
We'll pay you back!
Come with us!
We can pay you!
NK EXTERNAL ECONOMIC COMMITTEE, BEIJING
Yes!
Yes!
I'll do as you order, Comrade!
Pyongyang?
Comrade Jang Sung Taek's nephew Jang Sung Hoon
sold Chinese walnuts to the South, labeled as North Korean.
He got caught, and it was all over the news. So the Chinese police arrested him.
What did the Party say?
They said rumors had spread across Beijing three hours ago,
and asked why we didn't know?
Since it disgraces the Party's reputation, they said to resolve it quickly.
How much money do we need to cough up?
It's 250,000 dollars.
How much does the EEC have?
If we pool everything, it's barely 100,000 dollars.
Is there anyone we can borrow from?
In that case, report it to the Director first.
Hello?
Mr. Park Suk-young.
I'm Director Ri from the DPRK's External Economic Committee.
I'd like to meet you.
Right now?
All right, then. Where should we meet?
Come out of your hotel now.
I'll send a car.
Change of location.
Go out the back door.
Turn left and walk ten meters, and you'll see the night market gate.
Buy some flowers?
No!
Go through the market and out the back gate.
Watch where you're going!
Turn right and go around the corner,
and you'll see Hui Jia Mansions block 3, number 2.
Go through the gate and keep walking.
By the exit, you'll see Goryeo Restaurant.
I'll meet you there.
No one's following him.
GORYEO RESTAURANT
We need to search you.
Hey!
I told you to treat our guest respectfully. What are you doing?
These days, snoopers are running wild to harm our Republic.
So our comrades have become sensitive.
You must have been startled. Please be understanding.
No worries!
If you want honey, sometimes you get stung.
You have an audacious spirit.
Let's go.
RI MYONG UN DIRECTOR, EEC
There's not much to say about myself.
I'm just an ordinary person.
You can just call me Director Ri.
I'm Park Suk-young, an international businessman from Seoul Trading.
PARK SUK-YOUNG
This is our first meeting, and whether it will be the last,
I don't know yet…
The world is filled with things we don't know.
Please, speak openly.
Before talking about business…
Tell me openly if you can help with Comrade Jang's charges.
That's right!
I saw the news.
He's being held by the Chinese police, right?
Well, why not?
I should help a compatriot in need.
Good.
We seem to be on the same page, so let's cut to the point.
I'll ask just three things about your business.
You used to be in South Korea's defense agency, correct?
Yes, in the Defense Intelligence Command.
Before you were expelled, you got yourself in debt?
You know money. It's a mystery how quickly it disappears.
I didn't expect to hear that.
Did you study Marx's proverbs at the defense agency?
Sorry, it went down the wrong way.
Now the second question.
What do you want to buy from us?
Well, I'm a businessman.
Whatever makes money!
Last question.
Can you give us intel on South Korea?
You move fast, but now you've jumped the rails.
I'm just driving straight.
You mean state secrets?
Just be open about what you know, and we'll be satisfied.
It's to build trust between us.
Don't misunderstand.
Can I ask a question?
Sure.
Do you want to do politics or make money?
I might believe that a man expelled from the army is
now engaged in business.
But the Party won't be so easily convinced.
I get what you're saying.
But I wasn't expelled.
I handed in my resignation and left of my own free will.
Get your facts straight.
He's not going to be easy.
He kept his emotions hidden and skillfully used persuasion, threat and reassurance.
He seems to have an iron will.
Here's what you requested.
Pretty much any official will have heard of this intel.
It can't be considered a top secret.
Can you convince them with this?
When they said "be open," there was a hidden meaning in that.
Here.
From the case to the movement,
this is a work of art that even Rolex confirmed it's real.
Use it with confidence.
And make sure you choose a product that gives you a pretext to visit North Korea.
Something requiring inspection, that's located near the Yongbyon Reactor.
For example, zinc or iron ore.
I'll first listen to what they have to say,
then pull them along at my own pace.
Don't you think it's time to record their voices?
We at least need to give the analytics team a recording.
Good afternoon.
The 250,000 dollars that Jang borrowed for his products,
plus another 10,000 dollars to bribe the police,
so it's 260,000 dollars in total.
And this is the information you requested.
Introduce yourselves. This is Jong Moo Taek of the EEC.
Nice to meet you. Park Suk-young, Seoul Trading.
Jong Moo Taek.
Then I'll let you two discuss things alone.
Assemblyman Kim Sang-tae is leading a double life.
The mistress is actress An Su-jin.
What is this?
What do you mean? It's as it says.
I mean, is it true?
It used to be. Whether it still is, nobody knows.
An Su-jin…
I'd never have guessed.
But we'd prefer other info.
What about field manuals or satellite imagery?
You've got nothing new for us.
As I told you before,
it's been a while since I left the defense agency. So this is all I can get.
Please understand that. Oh, my…
I'm from the Ministry of State Security, sent to the EEC on assignment.
In other words, I'm not on the same path as Comrade Ri.
What's your path?
You just want to make money?
You bet I do!
That's why I came all the way here.
Business!
In that case, don't bother importing goods.
Pass over military secrets to me, exclusively.
It'll depend on the importance,
but for top secret material, I can pay you 300,000 dollars per secret.
God damn it! How many times should I tell you?
Look, I quit the army
and came kowtowing here in order to support my family,
but I've had 20 years of anti-Communist education,
and the word "commie" still sends shivers down my spine.
But what? Jesus Christ!
You want me to be a spy?
Don't give me that look.
A businessman refusing money?
So your goal never was to get rich.
Of course, the Party has the final say,
but I don't think your business with us is going to go well.
Wow. Forget it, then!
To hell with it.
You think I can't make money somewhere else?
Shit.
Damn North Koreans can't be trusted.
Mr. Park. How could you leave without saying goodbye?
Are you kidding? You called me here to play games?
I see we've upset you.
Shall we have dinner?
Forget dinner. I'm not hungry.
Are you still staying at Millennium Hotel?
Why ask if you already know? I'm going to pack up and go home.
Then I should see you before you go.
Meet me in 30 minutes at the Sky Lounge restaurant.
-Hello. -Hello.
Will you keep this for me?
Can I have your name?
We need to search you.
Comrade Jong.
It's for the protection of an officer abroad.
I can't believe this.
My apologies, Mr. Park.
What a beauty you have here.
Have a seat.
Oh, no. I feel bad.
I'm sorry, but I don't drink.
I'm aware you've had trouble with drinking since your army days.
Are you mocking us?
Mocking you? Not at all.
I used to drink a lot. It's true.
But for personal reasons, I quit drinking.
Let me pour you a glass instead.
If you offer a drink, you should accept one as well.
Otherwise, we'll assume you lack the will to do business with us.
We North Koreans don't negotiate with someone we haven't had a drink with.
It's not that I wouldn't like to.
Do I really have to explain this?
Actually, my father died because of alcohol.
At his funeral, my mother clasped my hands and begged me.
"Don't you ever drink again."
Now you sell your family history over a drink?
You're a shallow capitalist inside and out.
What?
What the hell did you say?
I'm selling my parents?
Who do you think you are, you bastard?
How old are you, you little Commie pipsqueak?
Will fear teach you some manners?
All right, you crazy shit! Go ahead and shoot, asshole!
Is this how your parents taught you?
Comrade Jong.
We're all here to join our hands,
but sharp words like "fear" might harm our partnership.
Don't you want this to work out?
Mr. Park is right.
We should follow our parents' wishes.
We have so much to learn from you.
I'm really sorry.
I should have controlled myself, but my temper…
Wow, my face is all flushed.
I'd better get some fresh air. Excuse me.
Comrade Jong.
You don't want to earn money?
When Mr. Park returns, excuse yourself and go out.
An hour later at 9:10 p.m.
Unusual behavior detected.
The items I left before.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Mr. Park.
Is this you getting fresh air?
Get him.
Don't touch me, you bastards!
Hey, are you seriously doing this again, you bastard?
Why do you keep feeling me up?
Foreign trade is the Director's responsibility.
Mine is national security. Search him.
What? You little…
Let go, assholes! I'm not working with you bastards!
Damned Commies!
Call the police!
Help me!
Shit! Help me!
-Calm down. -Shit!
-Call the police! -Rolex?
What's going on?
Comrade.
I'm just following the rules for the sake of revolution.
I know.
You're trying to do your job.
But you know what the problem is?
The Party ordered us to treat him respectfully, and you're disobeying it.
Leave.
Wait, is this a Rolex?
Such a precious thing, thrown on the floor!
Mr. Park.
You brought three of them?
Well, I just…
Under the direction of our great leader Kim Jong Il,
we offer you, our nation's dear guest, Mr. Park Suk-young,
the warmest of welcomes!
Oh, my.
Thank you.
Gosh.
As for cigarettes and cars,
the light industry bureau and compatriots in Northeast China
are already putting "Made in North Korea" labels
on Japanese and Chinese products
and re-exporting them abroad.
So it doesn't make sense to compete with them.
And there's not much profit in it for us.
So I don't think we can do your preferred business.
Then do you have another product in mind?
We can also import minerals, like zinc or iron ore.
From our point of view,
rather than specialized imports,
we'd like you to propose something more long-term
that could benefit both of us.
You mean partnering with South Korean companies?
That's right.
Wow…
There are tons of companies who want to enter North Korea.
But no conglomerates.
That's the will of our General Kim Jong Il.
If conglomerates are out, then what do we do?
That's why we need you.
As you said, your time living in a capitalist society
has taught you how to utilize capitalism.
If you propose something we like,
we'll consider granting you exclusive business rights.
I've been coming here since Jiang Zemin took power,
and much has changed in those two years.
That's the power of market reforms!
This antique was discovered in a Goryeo Dynasty tomb.
It's not easy for us to sell it here,
so we'd like you to convert it to cash in the South.
Well, as an antique,
this has absolutely no value.
But it's strange.
If it was really given to you by the North,
then it ought to be real.
Then what would the price be?
If it were real, about 500 million won?
If I pay them a lot, they'll suspect someone's behind me.
But if I don't, the deal might collapse.
I think it's a test.
It's an open secret
that Office 39 smuggles antiquities to finance Kim Jong Il's slush fund.
If it were real, they'd really be expecting cash.
But since not, they must be testing you.
How's the business plan?
You think it's really possible to shoot ads in North Korea?
The President has already given the go-ahead.
We only need the CIA's approval.
If you can take a camera team and move freely around the North,
you'll eventually be able to check on their hidden nuclear facilities.
It means we can see our enemy up close.
The advertisement is like a Trojan horse that will let us in.
To officially start business with the North,
we need the Unification Ministry's approval.
So I need to find a good Trojan horse.
Han Chang-ju, age 43.
After working 15 years as an advertising executive,
he went independent six years ago,
and shooting an ad in North Korea is his long-held ambition.
Back when I worked at Cheil, you know that ad
for Coca Cola with Shim Hye-jin, on the chin-up bar? That was mine.
But now a top star isn't enough. That's right.
We need to go to the North. At the peak of Mt. Baekdu, that crater lake…
The Democratic Party interprets the election results
as the opposition parties' victory
and is elated saying that the opposition parties will
have the upper hand from now on.
Hello.
I moved in next door today. So I brought you some rice cakes.
Oh, hello. Thank you.
Who is it?
He moved in next door today.
This is my husband.
Nice to meet you. I'll be seeing you around.
Yes, nice to meet you.
Advertising is all about issues.
If I could make this work?
Oh, thank you. This looks great.
It'd be all over the news, a sensation!
But what can I do? I can't get a foothold in the North.
I've just been throwing away money.
Wow.
I should have met you a few years ago.
Wait, the trading you do isn't with the North, is it?
Mr. Park. How about doing business together?
But I don't know anything about advertising.
How can we work together?
What's there to know?
You've got a product, an actor, a location, and you shoot.
Leave all that to me. I've been doing it for years.
Mr. Park?
As Kim Dae-jung hopes for continued success in the April general election,
the ruling party pledged to stop the opposition's momentum.
Thank you.
Which party do you think would be better for our business?
LEE HOI-CHANG NEW KOREA PARTY
Not sure. I don't follow politics.
Let's think about it if next week's Beijing presentation happens.
You're right. Shit, I'm getting ahead of myself.
To protect…
KIM DAE-JUNG DEMOCRATIC PARTY
…our nation's sovereignty…
THE NIS CHIEF OFFICE
CHIEF KIM JONG-CHAN
Director Choi.
The election's soon. Why do Kim Dae-jung's poll numbers keep going up?
The boost in his popularity seems like a temporary fad.
A fad?
The way I see it, it's not a fad. People are being hypnotized by communists.
Foreign operations are important,
but our people come first.
Our people are being hypnotized,
should the NIS just stand by?
If it lasts from the general election to next year's presidential race,
you think you and I will still have a job at the NIS?
Director Choi, I'll keep it simple.
This mania for Kim Dae-jung. Stop it.
Snuff it out!
MILLENNIUM HOTEL NIGHTCLUB, BEIJING
Watch where you're going!
Chief, hello!
Director Ri, how have you been?
Good to see you.
Our wrists are all shining!
Without selling anything, just renting locations,
you can earn a decade's worth of profits!
This is a total win-win deal!
It's surely an interesting proposal…
What?
Is the Party still holding back?
What do you think?
Advertisements, the very symbol of crooked capitalism,
being shot inside our Republic?
Ridiculous…
Mr. Jong, we're all one team now. Don't be so negative.
Comrades.
Why don't you go out and dance?
Director, advertisements are only the beginning.
Once it catches on, tourism and all will make you huge profits with time.
Mr. Park.
I'll be honest with you.
Yes.
The advertisement deal isn't something I can decide alone.
I'll need to go to Pyongyang.
I'll fight for it enthusiastically and let you know in three days.
Will you wait?
Of course I will!
I've waited nine months. What's three more days?
And here's what you asked for.
The cash from the antique.
Come on, Director Ri!
Did you give me a fake in return for that fake watch?
As an apology, I bought you some medicine you can't get in NK.
I'll contact you soon.
MILITARY DEMARCATION LINE
Moranbong, over.
Take up positions at MDL 134 upon your arrival.
We've entered Panmunjeom.
We detoured around Peace Bridge and are entering MDL 134.
Disperse your vehicles and advance to Hillock 312.
Report on firearms upon arrival.
Move quickly!
Take position!
Prepare to fire!
-Load mortars! -Load mortars!
APRIL 5, 1996 (6 DAYS BEFORE ELECTION) ARMED PROVOCATION IN PANMUNJEOM
Today at 1:25 a.m.,
260 North Korean soldiers entered the Joint Security Area
and bombarded a portion of the DMZ.
Responding to this armed provocation,
the US Forces Korea issued an alert,
and is preparing for any further hostile acts.
The Korean army ordered its soldiers to mobilize…
…prompting the government to raise its alert level
from WATCHCON 3 to WATCHCON 2.
…the first time since 1982 to reach WATCHCON 2.
At this clear violation of the 1953 Armistice, the UN decided
on a firm response.
The President said…
Director Choi speaking.
Sir.
-What's going on at Panmunjeom? -What do you think?
The Commies are shooting at us again.
Luckily, no signs of nuclear weapons yet.
You get that deal wrapped up. Why still no news?
I'm waiting too.
That's why I asked about Panmunjeom.
It might affect the deal.
Press on, with belief in your nation.
Until our tanks reach the Palace of the Sun, okay?
Kim Dae-jung suffered a clear defeat in national elections.
Analysts believe North Korea's recent provocations at Panmunjeom
caused voters to prioritize security concerns.
See, you need to stir the people's emotions for them to vote properly.
Anyway, nice work.
The VIP is very pleased with the election results.
Please wrap things up neatly so there are no leaks.
Yes, sir.

GOVERNMENT COVERTLY SENDING FLOUR TO NORTH
THE GOVERNMENT…
…THROUGH CHINA.
SUSPICIOUS DEATH OF KOREAN-CHINESE MAN
A strange feeling has come over me.
The feeling that Pyongyang and Seoul are acting independent of Beijing.
Who made Dr. Jang meet with Director Ri?
Is his death and the North's provocation connected?
Hello?
Mr. Park.
This is Pyongyang.
Director Ri! It's been a while!
Sorry for having keeping you waiting.
No problem.
How are things with the ad project?
Regarding that…
You'll have to come to Pyongyang.
Pardon?
To Pyongyang?
Our Great Leader Kim Jong Il
would like to meet you in person.
APRIL 27, 1996 SUNAN AIRPORT
PYONGYANG NO. 32 VILLA
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA
Let's go.
If you want to meet the greatest figure in our Republic, you must be clean.
If you were to pass on an infectious disease,
that itself could cause a national crisis.
Think of this as a chance to check your health more precisely.
You'll wait here until we have the test results.
One more thing.
Due to lack of power, there may be blackouts. So don't be alarmed.
April 27, 1996.
Section Chief Jong Moo Taek, the Ministry of State Security of DPRK,
will interrogate official visitor Park Suk-young of South Korea.
State your name and affiliation.
State your name and affiliation.
Name.
Park Suk-young.
Republic of Korea Defense Intelligence Command.
Mr. Park, change your clothes and come out.
Did you sleep well?
It's a required procedure, so don't let it bother you.
If you end up exposed or detained,
the government and the NIS will deny everything.
In a worst-case scenario,
make your own decision.
We're turning onto Route 9.
Attention!
State your department and rank within the Defense Agency.
Espionage operations team A23, officer.
What's your purpose in coming to Pyongyang?
An order from my superior.
Right…
Who's the superior who gave the order?
Tell me.
I didn't like you from the start.
An intelligence officer with an inferiority complex,
fallen to the temptations of capital.
That story,
doesn't it sound so perfect that it feels like fabricated?
Speaking for my Party, I'll warn you one last time.
If you've got any wrong ideas about this ad business,
not only you, but those close to you will suffer.
Superior?
Who could be a businessman's superior?
Cash! People with money.
Attention! Divide!
Take off your coat.
When you look at the General, don't meet his eyes.
Stare at the second button on his shirt.
Most importantly, don't interrupt or contradict him.
Please remember this.
The General will now enter!
Have a seat.
You don't drink, right, Mr. Park?
No, I don't. I apologize.
I'll pour you a glass instead.
If we ever achieve reunification,
I'll gladly accept a drink from you then.
That's an audacious answer.
So then,
let's speak with open minds.
The advertising business that you proposed…
How much will our Republic make?
A down payment of 600,000 dollars,
and a total of five million dollars in the contract.
However,
based on your decision, you could earn much more.
Making decisions isn't hard.
Tell me more.
In order to receive more, we must accept ads from conglomerates.
In other words, their products would be photographed in North Korea.
To do that,
we must be able to visit places across North Korea freely.
If we find suitable locations and shoot advertisements,
over five years, we estimate you will earn 12 million dollars, at least.
However, this is just the beginning.
Mr. Park has developed other business plans beyond advertising.
General.
Please allow us to open the bag we have brought.
A plan for a tourist hotel in Mt. Geumgang.
The hotel and related development will cost 13 million dollars.
I can raise it.
After that, all profits go to you and the Republic.
Comrade Ri.
Yes, General.
Sign the deal.
Yes, sir.
It's Goryeo celadon.
Discuss it with our side, then sell it in the South.
Yes, sir. I'll get you the best price!
TV ads for South Korean products will soon be shot on North Korean soil.
A Korean advertising agency recently signed an agreement with the North,
opening the way for a new era in North-South exchange.
Our correspondent from Beijing reports.
The contract for co-produced advertisements lasts for five years,
starting with four-week shoots in April, June and September this year.
The Trojan horse is aimed at North Korea's heart.
Now we just need to launch the attack.
In return for approving the ad business,
Kim Jong Il wants us to sell antiquities from Myohyang Museum.
It contains 23,000 pieces dating back to the 1st century BC.
Appraisers estimate their total value at 1.5 trillion won.
So the question is, who will buy 1.5 trillion won's worth of antiquities?
If we offer a monopoly on Mt. Geumgang tourism and ads in the North,
I'm sure some of the conglomerates will be interested.
I'll convert these items here
to cash in South Korea at once.
As for the rest,
let's sort that out when the advertiser is fixed.
-Thanks for your help. -Yes, sir.
GEUMGANG RESTAURANT
"MT. GEUMGANG IS THE SPIRIT OF KOREA." - KIM JONG IL
Over there!
There!
The North claims that since IAEA inspections,
the Yongbyon reactor has remained inactive.
If you can check clearly whether the reactor was restarted,
it will be an important clue about their nuclear program.
For now, we're only allowed to visit tourist sites.
I'll continue with the antiquities and search for a way to access Yongbyon.
YONGBYON
Getting into the Yongbyon facility is probably impossible.
Professor Kim Jang-hyuk contacted us.
If you can make it within 10km of the reactor,
one of the researchers will pass over some documents.
We're searching for someone who can guide you there.
Just wait.
SOMEONE PURGED BY THE KIM REGIME…
…WHO COULD BE PERSUADED TO COOPERATE.
NORTH PYONGAN PROVINCE GURYONG VILLA
Every Korean wants to see Mt. Geumgang and Mt. Baekdu,
but after a while, they'll be no longer so enticing.
I'm just saying that for some brands, they may not want that image.
Then where do you want to shoot?
We'll first do Baekdu, Geumgang, Pyongyang, and Kaesong in order.
And lastly, we could shoot in a place like Yongbyon district.
You know the song, "Azaleas on Yongbyon's Yaksan," right?
It's famous in the South, too.
That won't be possible.
Yongbyon is a restricted military area, so you can't go in there.
Sir?
Can I have a word with you?
This is a bit sensitive,
but I met an archaeologist before coming here.
He said at Guryong River, about five kilometers from Yongbyon,
there are a few undiscovered Goguryeo-era royal tombs.
What's that got to do with me?
Just hear me out.
Such ancient artifacts are extremely rare even in the South.
If we open just one tomb, it could be worth 30 million dollars at least.
You want to rob graves on North Korean land?
I just mean…
You know how Director Ri isn't too keen on the antiquities trade?
So I can't suggest it to him like this,
but I thought you might be up for it. So I'm telling you this privately.
To be honest, we don't need to shoot in Yongbyon.
But it can be a good excuse to go to Yongbyon to open some tombs.
In that case,
just ask the General yourself since you're allowed to have an audience with him.
Why go through the back door with me?
Come on. This is so frustrating.
What if I raise his hopes,
and then we don't find any tomb there?
You think he'd forgive me?
So we must check if they really exist.
And after determining the locations,
then we'll report it to the General.
This could get you a promotion.
And of course, I'll get my antiquities fee.
You really are a perfect capitalist.
Since we've come this far,
I'll try convincing Director Ri to visit Guryong River.
No,
since I'm in charge of territorial defense and security issues,
I'll issue an order.
Wow, you're a natural-born soldier! A decisive one!
I mean, you sure are different from Director Ri.
A MARKET NEAR GURYONG RIVER, YONGBYON DISTRICT
Get lost.
Mr. Park.
Are there really royal tombs here?
Sure.
Anyway, do a thorough search.
My agents and I have a Party event, so we can't accompany you.
From now on, Comrade Ri and Comrade Kim will go with you.
A pin bestowed by the Party.
This pin means you've passed all the tests to prove yourself,
and you're now fully one of us.
We North Koreans are simple by nature.
Once we start trusting you, we'll even hand over our pants.
Thank you.
I'll wait for you here, go with Comrade Kim.
Sure.
Okay, next person.
Hey! Keep in line!
No, wait! Those little brats!
Catch them!
-Please catch them. -Those damn sticky fingers!
Spare me some mercy.
Hey, kid.
Give me that.
I found it first!
You little brat. Be quiet and just give it to me!
Don't look.
Keep walking straight.
As you know, the researcher who will give you a gift
is under strict surveillance, and can't leave the guarded area.
Late at night during the blackout, I'll come take you there.
Until then, buy time on the pretext of looking for tombs.
Mr. Park.
I love my country, too.
But the country I love
is being turned into a jail at the hands of the Kim family.
What the heck are you talking about?
What's this about a guarded area?
And what do you mean, I should buy time?
We need to find those tombs quickly, so stop wasting time and let's go!
Mr. Park.
Yes?
Let me introduce you to my family.
Say hello.
Hello, sir!
This is Mr. Park Suk-young from South Korea.
He's my son, and this is my wife.
Nice to meet you, ma'am!
What a beauty you are!
Wow, how old are you?
You're good-looking! You take after your mother.
I guess we're all here, so let's eat.
Is Mr. Kim not eating? I haven't seen him all night.
You won't be seeing him around anymore.
He'll be concentrating on Vladivostok trading for a while.
Still, leaving without saying goodbye?
Where is he now?
Mr. Park.
The advertising project we are working on
is the first example
of cooperation between the North and the South in 40 years.
I don't know under whose orders Comrade Kim has been acting,
but this could not only mean the end of North-South exchange,
but also…
put all of us including myself
into an extremely dangerous situation.
I won't argue that you are a businessman at this point.
The advertising project will continue without a problem,
so be exceptionally careful how you behave.
DECEMBER 1997, SEOUL 15 DAYS TO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
A month before infiltrating into Yongbyon, we've hit a snag.
Did Director Ri find out who I really am?
If he's turning a blind eye,
it means the ad project can't be stopped because it was approved by Kim Jong Il.
It's hard to judge.
As Democratic nominee Kim Dae-jung maintains his lead in the polls,
Lee Hoi-chang appears to be chasing right behind him.
Let's look at the latest poll numbers.
With Kim in front at 32.1% and Lee in second at 29.8%,
they are separated by only 2.3%,
setting the stage for a two-way race.
Based on Professor Kim Jang-hyuk's testimony
and other intel we've gathered,
they sent chemical weapons to Pakistan and have already developed uranium bombs.
The situation is urgent.
So,
what exactly is that other intel you mentioned?
How long will we rely on testimony and guesswork?
Bring me facts based on real evidence.
My apologies.
For now, don't share the nuclear intel with the CIA.
With no evidence, there's no need to stir things up before the election.
This was obtained by our domestic division.
PLANS FOR SHUTDOWN OF NIS
Our fears are slowly turning into reality.
KIM DAE-JUNG PLANS FOR NEW AGENCY
Hak-seong.
At this rate, we're all doomed.
Everyone at the NIS
including you and myself will be fired if the ruling party is changed.
Try contacting the North.
There's no time.
I've been trying various routes to reach them,
but with all HUMINT gone…
There's one clear contact. Black Venus.
We've invested so much in him.
Sir.
It's my duty to make this operation successful.
Orders come first!
Operations second!
An order from whom?
From the nation!
The nation, and the people!
Director Choi, please.
Let's win the election first and then think about the rest.
Our unit is being destroyed. We can't just lie in ambush, can we?
Sir.
I just don't understand this.
Why do I have to deliver a letter from the ruling party?
You just pass it on.
The envelope was specially made, so if you open it, they'll know.
Just deliver it as is.
But sir,
they think I'm a businessman.
If a businessman passes on such a letter,
they'll start to suspect his identity.
I'm saying they might stop the advertisement project.
Not necessarily.
Businessmen and politicians are always close.
The election is in two weeks.
You should do your part.
I'll be honest. This letter reminds me of the general election.
It's from the ruling party, so it'll inevitably hurt the opposition.
Then you're willing to let Kim Dae-jung become president?
You'd let the motherland fall to the Commies?
No, it just…
feels like we're interfering in the election…
You know the NIS has been mainly investigating Kim Dae-jung for 37 years.
It means he's ideologically dangerous!
If he's elected, the North is the one who will jump for joy, right?
Yes.
According to our intel,
if he's elected, he might hand the whole country over to North Korea!
That's even more of a threat than nuclear weapons, isn't it?
Sir.
It's true the ad business has its difficulties.
But it's only the beginning.
If it continues for five years without a problem,
we'll not only learn about nuclear weapons,
but also know everything that's going on there!
-Why all of a sudden… -Don't argue. Just do it!
Major Park…
You can't just look at it from your perspective.
It's the organization's decision.
This time,
follow their decision.
9 DAYS BEFORE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BEIJING
December 8, 1997.
Three days after I delivered the letter to Director Ri,
the ruling party's assemblymen set up camp at the Millennium Hotel,
and are still there after two days.
SEOUL TRADING, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S FATHER DIED
I got a sudden order from the head office to fly back home.
Now, I need to find out how I'm being used for the presidential election.
Hello?
Director Ri! I'm in front of your room, can I see you for a moment?
I'm almost there, but I have another appointment right away.
I just need to give you a document in person.
It's a draft advertisement from a South Korean company.
You know, the one about driving to one's hometown?
Sorry, but I'll have to receive the document and head out right away.
That's fine. Then I'll wait in the room.
He told me to wait in his room.
What room did he mean?
Where's Mr. Park?
He's waiting in your room at the moment.
I said not to let anyone in.
Stay with him.
Mr. Park.
Mr. Park?
Mr. Park?
What is it? Where's Director Ri?
We thought I'd better keep you company. And we've something to ask.
Oh, really? Have a seat then.
Make yourself at home.
Director Ri!
Why's it so hard to meet you lately?
You're not avoiding me, are you?
Mr. Park, don't say such things. I'm hurt.
I've been busy with the Party duties.
Let's have dinner together sometime soon.
Sure.
Take a look at this draft and think it over.
It's the journey of a displaced old man returning to his hometown.
All right, then.
Number 64 on the move. Stand by.
I'm Park Sang-tae.
I'm Yoo Won-hyeong.
I'm Choi, the director of foreign operations at the NIS.
Thanks for meeting us.
We talked it over
and decided that a week before the election,
broadcast propaganda or news conferences about Kim Dae-jung
won't have the effect we're looking for.
Then what do you want?
Don't we need a military action, like during the general election?
But this time, not just firing a few guns.
We need something to shake the people's confidence.
"Our national security comes first,
so I better not vote for Kim Dae-jung."
Something like that.
ELECTION INTERFERENCE TO MAKE KIM DAE-JUNG LOSE
Then, nuclear weapons are the only option.
Don't joke in an important meeting like this.
Wait a minute.
Does the North really have nuclear weapons?
What does it matter?
If the South Korean people
believe we do until the election is over, isn't that enough?
That's good!
To be honest, troop movements in the DMZ or submarines in the East Sea,
those are getting old.
People are used to it.
That's enough.
It's far above our pay grade.
Come on. Don't be like that.
We are the leading representatives of the North and the South.
So let's freely share our intentions.
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but our representatives seem to have expressed their views.
To let the practical operatives discuss things, will you give us some privacy?
All right. I'll go smoke a cigarette.
I'll be straightforward.
The nuclear issue
is extremely sensitive for our administration.
If it becomes known the North developed nukes,
we'll share the blame. It won't be good for the election.
Let's go with a simple strike.
By a simple strike,
do you mean firing in the DMZ like last time?
No, I'm not talking about the same thing as last time.
The rehearsal's over, and it's time for the main performance.
This time,
we'd like substantive strikes on the five West Sea islands across the truce line
which will look like war's about to break out.
Look here, Mr. Choi.
In everything, there are lines we mustn't cross.
Now the ad business is helping to warm North-South relations,
but if there's armed provocation at the truce line,
all North-South relations will enter a deep freeze.
You need to know restraint.
Well…
This is frustrating, talking to a man of different stripes.
All right.
For the past 40 years, North-South relations have always been frozen.
The ice is very thick now, so do you think anything will change
if it freezes a bit more?
Director Ri.
We're just going to follow the Party's orders anyway.
Let's send the proposal and hear their decision.
Anyway, it's your duty to pass along our intentions,
so please ask the Party.
First of all, for the North's efforts,
we'll compensate you with US dollars, not in flour. And this is the amount.
That's generous!
Director Ri.
I'll send a direct request to the office in Pyongyang.
It's quite cold outside. Did you have a good talk?
So…
I spoke with a North Korean official not long ago.
He said people in the North don't want Kim Dae-jung either.
A North Korean official?
Everyone that matters is here. What do you mean?
From the Party's point of view,
it's true dealing with veteran politicians from the South is not easy.
Plus, governments in the South
have long accused Kim Dae-jung of being Communist,
and I heard many citizens suspect it too.
So if he's elected,
he may enact stronger anti-Communist policies to clear the air.
Comrade Jong, watch your tongue.
That's right.
North Korea needs an "external enemy" to hold out,
but if the pro-North Kim is elected,
you can't criticize him.
And so,
this arrangement benefits both of us, right?
Comrade Jong!
Besides, Kim Dae-jung is quite tall,
so our great General would have to look up at him.
That should never happen.
Jong Moo Taek, the Ministry of State Security.
The Party approved it.
But the Director ordered
that we procure 400,000 dollars of live ammunition for State Security.
I'll do as you order, Comrade.
The Party approved it.
Nice work!
Director Choi, great job!
That was excellent!
-Saved by North Korea! -Yes!
Something this big, we'll win by a landslide!
-Long live South Korea! -Hurrah!
-Long live General Kim Jong Il! -Hurrah!
Apologies, sir.
It's an emergency, so I crossed the line.
However urgent the situation,
don't you think this is too dangerous an act for a spy?
Sir.
The North Korean leadership has gone mad with Communism, right?
That's absolutely true!
And Kim Dae-jung must not be allowed to become president.
Because according to you, he's a Communist too.
Why keep stating the obvious?
But I hear North Korea doesn't want Kim Dae-jung elected.
The Communists don't want a Communist.
Did you wiretap them?
You are not answering me.
Why are the Communists against a Communist?
I get how you feel.
You've straddled the capitalist and Communist camps so long…
Please stop.
You cut off your superior?
You've got some growing up to do.
If you widen your perspective,
one day you'll understand what I'm saying right now.
This thing called politics,
it's hard to grasp with the logic of ordinary people.
Please stop talking nonsense!
Can't you at least be honest?
Your organization always needs an enemy.
And you use that enemy to scare people because you want to maintain your power.
That's ridiculous!
I'm trying…
to stop Kim Dae-jung for the sake of the people and the nation!
Is working for the people the same
as working for the ruling party?
Up to now, I have put my life and my family on the line
in order to answer the call of my country.
For me to see my mission through to the end,
please…
support me.
Park Suk-young…
I sent you to infiltrate the Commies.
But I see they infiltrated you.
So…
Major Park.
Black Venus!
While we were looking at the Beijing skyline at night, you said
that after its reformation, China changed a lot in a short time.
After throwing the door open,
China too has its share of problems.
Still, you at least thought that it was worth a try?
Director Ri.
The ad business is not just about money,
but a way to change through contact with the South…
Isn't that what you meant back then?
That's right.
You saw it yourself too, didn't you?
Three million of my countrymen are starving and freezing to death now.
Babies who have yet to take their first step
cough up blood and die, or…
Or they're sold for just ten dollars.
Why do you trust me?
Because it's the only choice I have.
But it's all over now.
Troops are already moving.
No.
There's one more thing we can do.
Sir.
The "business" we were doing, that word has two meanings.
It means both commerce and venture.
Sir.
Will you try one last venture with me?
I'm sure South Korean guys can't do without me.
So whenever they have an election, they run over here
asking me to fire artillery, shoot missiles…
What else can I do? I should help my compatriots.
Isn't that right, Mr. Park?
My concern is,
you're not helping them, but being used by them.
Mr. Park.
What amazes me
about people is…
A few months after birth, they learn to speak.
But decades later, they still haven't learned to keep silent.
Even when it may shorten their lives.
Thanks for your concern. Now go.
What I'd like to say is,
if the armed provocation takes place,
both the advertisements and the antiquities business
will likely come to an end.
I used to think you were bright,
but now I see your analytical skills are lacking.
I grant their request out of a sense of compatriotism,
so why do you think it'll affect the ad business negatively?
What will happen if the election doesn't turn out as you expect?
I mean, what if Kim Dae-jung is elected despite the provocation?
General.
Park's words are not necessarily wrong.
According to data collected in the South,
the provocation in Panmunjeom
during last election is arousing suspicion among the public.
So if your action
provokes a negative response and Kim Dae-jung is elected,
the ad business could suffer from the backlash and get swept away,
and the antiquities trade which funds your policies will crumble.
Come out here!
You're Section Chief Jong?
Colonel Jong Moo Taek, sir!
You must have heard everything. Tell me your opinion.
If your officially sanctioned order is reversed,
the South Koreans will look down on our system.
If anyone disagrees with this,
they are corrupt capitalist traitors starting a false rumor.
If Chief Jong's words are spoken out of loyalty,
then he's not wrong.
But I believe not everyone at State Security
supports this action out of loyalty.
What's this now?
I'm sure
you have been told the South will pay 3.6 million dollars for the action.
However, the amount they really offered is 4 million dollars.
Can you guess where the other 400,000 went?
Are you saying someone among our comrades
joined hands with the South to beguile me?
Treacherous bastards!
Did you know about this?
We haven't confirmed it yet.
You haven't confirmed it yet?
Then it might be true?
Forgive me! It's…
It's all due to our negligence.
Thanks to your great decisions, you have gained much recently.
Ads and tourism, reunions of separated families.
Profits and promotion of our nation's scenery.
Most of all, you've been able to show the entire world
your decisiveness and magnanimity in bringing reconciliation.
But General,
if you order military action before the election, everything will be lost.
For a mere 4 million dollars, will you lose benefits worth 100 times more?
Hey, Ri Myong Un!
This is a national disgrace!
This armed action along the truce line,
do a full investigation and root out all reactionaries!
I'll do as you order, sir!
Before that,
all the deals with Southern politicians, including the military action,
are on hold.
We've already shown them
we can affect elections in the South if we want to. Isn't that right?
Panmunjeom JSA Post 1, all clear.
-Post 2, all clear. -Reporting…
No, we haven't detected anything unusual on the Northern side.
Hey, did you check properly?
I told you to watch every unit from the DMZ to the 38th parallel!
Sir.
I checked on the target,
but he took an Air Goryeo flight from Beijing to Pyongyang.
What?
That bastard…
Son of a bitch!
Kim Dae-jung is leading in Gwangju, Daejeon, and Gyeonggi Province
while Lee Hoi-chang leads in Ulsan.
That's how the votes by region
stand at the present moment.
We'll provide more updates as they come in.
WHO WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT?
ELECTED
ELECTED
FIRST CHANGE OF PARTY IN 50 YEARS
For the first time in 50 years,
the ruling and opposition parties are switching places.
After promising to become the foreign policy president,
Kim plans a new effort for the peaceful reunification of Korea.
Dear respected citizens, I sincerely thank you.
The whole world has watched our election,
to see what choice the crisis-struck Korean people would make.
I will appoint new envoys to the North
and propose restarting negotiations on the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement.
And if necessary,
I will propose a summit meeting with Kim Jong Il.
My dear and respected citizens,
I promise to devote myself to opening a great new era
for the Republic of Korea.
Hello!
Welcome.
I've wanted to give you a gift for a long time.
It's quite humble,
but if you don't dislike it, please accept it.
A MAN OF AUDACIOUS SPIRIT
After you go back, when can I see you again?
We'll meet often for the ads, I'm sure.
Just as we used to.
Wait. Do you want a drink?
Sure, why not?
To the great ad business that will change the Korean Peninsula.
-Cheers! -Cheers!
About the strike on the five islands.
Apart from us, who knows about it?
The three of us here,
and Assemblyman Yoo who went there with us.
A total of five.
Who's the other person?
A black agent of ours working in Beijing.
He wiretapped Northern officials, and heard it by accident.
Can he be trusted?
It's not certain.
Keep him quiet at all costs. That's our only path to survival.
Delete any mention of NK nukes, since it'll trouble the President.
Emphasize in particular
the trips to the North he took alone without the NIS' orders.
So we can use the National Security Law.
The National Security Law?
The sponsor of the North Korean ads is the S company, right?
Yes, that's right.
In that case,
make it look like a tip-off was from their competitor.
Like a rival company with a grudge against the ad business.
Delivery!
REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL SPYING
The spy Black Venus who is mentioned the most in the leaked report,
is said to be an advertising executive named Park.
It's been confirmed he recently visited North Korea in secret
and handed over military secrets to the North.
His importance to the North
is shown from the fact that he even had private meetings with Kim Jong Il.
Director Ri!
LEAKED REPORT ON THE NIS SPIES
Black Venus.
Do you realize what this means?
A South Korean spy who deceived us
met the head of our nation.
It changes nothing.
Changes nothing?
You're so simple.
I warned you, didn't I?
I'll explain everything.
Don't bother.
You and I were just working for the sake of our countries.
It's nothing personal.
Convert.
Then I'll guarantee
the safety of you and your family.
Just like you have only one motherland,
I have only one motherland.
I trust you to protect my family.
South Korea is such an interesting country.
How could an intelligence service leak intel on its own agents?
No matter how hard I think about it, I can't figure it out.
The Party doesn't know yet.
But they will in an hour at most.
With this ID,
no one will stop you from leaving Pyongyang.
Cross the border as soon as possible.
Then what will happen to you?
I studied capitalist economics,
and am the only one who can oversee foreign currency earning.
So…
I'm sure they won't kill me.
Go!
ID check.
ID check.
Let's see your ID.
IDENTITY CERTIFIED BY KIM JONG IL RIM CHOL JUN
I didn't expect to see you here. My apologies, sir.
ID check.
I hope we can meet again.
The promise we made to each other…
I'll keep it no matter what.
If we're fated to meet again,
then we will someday.
After that day,
no one in Beijing ever saw anyone in Ri's circle, including Jong, again.
Comrade Ri Myong Un!
The Party summons you.
GORYEO RESTAURANT
Three years ago, I first met Director Ri here.
He said North Korea needed to change sooner or later.
Can he ever come back here?
I don't even know if his family is alive.
The prosecutors' office has assembled a special team
to investigate the "Northern Wind" case from the last election.
As the 1996 military action in the DMZ
is also suspected as a case of electoral interference,
key members of the previous administration are falling under suspicion.
Internal investigations at the NIS
suggest election meddling was led by Director L,
head of the foreign operations team, without the organization's orders.
The reunions of separated family members resumed,
and the NIS was re-organized into a new entity.
Why…
did I become a spy?
What have I been fighting for all this time?
5 YEARS LATER, 2005 SHOOTING STUDIO, SHANGHAI
For the first time, a North Korean woman
will model in an ad for a South Korean company.
Attention is focusing on whether this project
can serve as an impetus to thaw the recent chill in North-South relations.
Look, it's Lee Hyori.
She looks smaller than on camera, right?
I really want to say hi to her before the shooting starts.
Come on, don't be silly. That's embarrassing.
It took us ten years to get here.
-How are you feeling at this moment? -Please say something!
Did you know about Jo Myong Ae before?
Please say a word as a model representing South Korea!
Hyori!
Hyori!
Hyori…
This is Jo Myong Ae from the North.
And this is Lee Hyori from the South. Say hello.
Hello.
How old are you?
I was born in 1980.
Then think of me as an older sister.
Was it difficult getting here?
It was fine.
Shake her hand, like this.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
IN JUNE 2010, BLACK VENUS WAS ARRESTED FOR VIOLATING
THE NATIONAL SECURITY LAW WHILE DOING BUSINESS WITH NORTH KOREA.
HE WAS CHARGED WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OFFENSES IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY LAW,
INCLUDING ESPIONAGE, BORDER CROSSING, CORRESPONDING WITH THE ENEMY, ETC.
HE WAS RELEASED IN MAY, 2016 AFTER SERVING SIX YEARS IN PRISON.
my name is Brooks Rattigan,
but I don't just want you to know that,
I want the world to know that,
because I wanna change the world.
Like my heroes before me,
Jobs, Jordan,
Musk, game changers.
World changers.
These are big lives,
glamorous lives.
My dad lived a pretty big life.
Now he...
doesn't.
You can't change the world alone.
Every Jobs needs a Watts, every Jordan has a Pippen,
every Musk has...
Well, actually I think
Musk will probably end up on Mars by himself.
I've got Murph.
[chuckles] The reviews are in.
-And? -Someone wrote...
Oh, "This app made me poke my eyes out, thanks for nothing."
But someone else wrote, "Groovy app," so...
I guess it's net neutral.
-It's good that they're not all bad. -True.
On to the next one.
[Brooks] Another crucial lesson I've learned  from my heroes and from Murph,
"Always be improving."
I invoke this lesson daily in my current profession...
purveyor of the culinary arts.
Without vision, we succumb to the average, and what I want is the extraordinary
and the support of an extraordinary unive--
Okay. That's enough.
-But there's actually five more pages. -That's plenty.
Okay.
So what do you think?
I think...
I think all the words were there.
You hate it.
I bare my soul on these pages and you hate my soul.
You didn't bare your soul. That's what I hate about it.
-Say more about that. -You wanna change the world?
What about it?
The world needs changing and I'm sure that you can agree with that.
You talk about creating the next big thing. What thing?
And you wanna be a game-changer.
What is the game?
You're really going full-blown Shark Tank on me,
and I have to say that I appreciate it.
-Yale's the goal, correct? -Yes, more than anything in the world.
You have the grades.
Thank you for noticing.
They're not just looking for good grades.
If you wanna stand out, you're gonna have to rework your essay.
You're gonna have to look real deep inside
and ask yourself,
"Who is Brooks Rattigan?"
[man] Wanna take it for a spin, Rattigan?
-Uh, yeah, sure. -Yeah?
No. No!
Hey, he's home.
Good thing I got a second box here.
No, I think I'm just gonna grab something from work.
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. Don't go.
I feel like we don't talk anymore.
Really? I feel like that's pretty much all we do.
You met with the counselor today, right? How did that go?
It was good. She told me that Yale's competitive. Did you know that?
I thought we agreed on UCONN?
Faculty scions only pay room and board.
Dad, I told you not to worry about the money.
Okay, you're right. Why am I worried about money?
Okay, you're right. Why am I worried about money? College is free, right?
I'm gonna figure it out.
[sighs] I don't get it.
It's a great school.
UCONN is like the girl down the street who eats food in bed and smells like it.
-Patty Munchwrath? -I love Patty, she's fantastic,
but she's not Yale.
Yale...
She is...
she's smart,
she's stylish, but not flashy.
She's cultured, she speaks multiple languages, probably knows how to sail.
You get accepted by her,
that means you're somebody special.
Murph, do you wanna write my admissions essay for me?
We could do it like a thought exercise.
I'm good, cos I'm writing mine, because people write their own.
Give me some inspiration. What's your core theme?
I'm writing about my struggles with dyslexia,
and I'm writing it backwards.
That's genius.
-Do you wanna hear what I got? -Mm.
"My name is Brooks Rattigan."
I like it.
It's raw.
Honest.
I don't know, man, I think my life's interesting. I just don't know how to  articulate it, you know?
I just don't know how to  articulate it, you know?
Why don't you write about your mom leaving?
-That's interesting. -That's a really short essay, actually.
Dad got bucked off the publishing horse instead of getting back on it,
and chasing after his cowgirl,
he decided that sitting in the mud was good enough for him.
Yeah, but she left you too.
No, I think in truth she left this town, and I can't hold that against her.
Nothing is good enough for you.
I think I can respect that.
[man] My aunt and uncle keep begging me, and it's like I'm not gonna say, "No."
You say, "No," because she's family and dating your cousin is weird.
Dude, I'm not dating my cousin, I'm escorting her to a semi-formal like Greenwich Prep, that's it.
I'm escorting her to a semi-formal like Greenwich Prep, that's it.
Plus my uncle is paying me too, so...
What up, Rattigan? Italian sub on wheat, no tomatoes.
Italian sub for the Italian guy.
I'm Swedish.
No, yeah, I know,
just no self-respecting Italian would turn his back on the tomato.
Word.
Anyway, I mean, dude, it's like the worst timing ever too.
Like, Maddison's parents are gonna be gone
for the night and we'd have the house to ourselves.
Is your cousin hot? I'll take her if she's hot.
I'll take your cousin.
-What? -Yeah, what?
Yeah, what?
-I'll take your cousin to the dance. -Oh, yeah, sandwich boy?
Yeah? You gonna be wearing those plastic gloves too?
Cos my aunt would love that.
No, this is Greenwich, so I would dress the part.
-Why? What would you get out of it? -I get the payment you're talking about.
-And I get to take your car. -[laughs]
No, you're not taking my car.
Come on, man, you're gonna tell me that you really wanna give up the chance
of spending an entire night all alone with Maddison when her parents are out of town?
You got a suit?
Woo! I cannot believe he said yes, Murph. This is incredible!
It's just a car. You have no appreciation for the finer things in life.
You have no appreciation for the finer things in life. Speaking of things
I don't have appreciation for, remind me again,
why you agreed to do this? Because I need the money.
Who knows, maybe stepping outside of myself,
becoming someone else for the night, it might help me finish my essay.
And who are you gonna become?
Whatever she wants me to be, which I'm pretty sure is
what every other girl wants me to be.
Some knight in shining armor,
some Prince Charming to open doors for her and compliment her hair.
You're getting paid to take a girl on a date.
So, did you know that Michelle Obama got paid to go on a date with Barack
-and look how great that turned out. -Is that true?
I don't know. I'm not a presidential historian, but it could be true,
and that is my point.
-Hello, sir. Brooks Rattigan. -Brooks Rattigan.
Reece told us all about you.
Just your name, but that's all I needed to run the background check.
No, I actually know that you ran a background check.
-I found out when I ran one on you. -[guffaws]
-Jerry Lieberman. Come in, Brooks. -Sure.
Before you have a chance to change your mind.
I'm kidding.
I like to joke about things.
-So, welcome to our humble abode. -[young woman] This is stupid!
-As you can see, all original flooring. -[young woman] Get out!
I swear, Jerry, the wrinkles that girl has caused me
in places I didn't even know could wrinkle.
Honey, our guest has arrived.
Hi.
Brooks Rattigan.
Lillian Lieberman.
She won't wear the shoes.
There are no "the shoes," there's just shoes. Is she wearing shoes?
[Jerry] It's a miracle she agreed to do this.
Good evening.
-I am-- -Reece's bitch?
-Celia! -Relax, he knows I'm kidding.
Right, slum?
Oh, sweetie, you look so beautiful.
I'm not wearing the shoes.
-But they go. -Listen to yourself.
Well, I happen to think that heels are an outmoded display of
female oppression.
Fine.
Thanks, Mom.
Let's do this, so we can stop doing this.
[Jerry] You kids have fun.
-Thanks for the assist back there. -Yeah, no, just part of the job.
Reece let you use his car.
Man, he was really desperate to get out of this, wasn't he?
No, he wanted to go with you. He thought we would have more fun together. -Uh-huh. -Here.
There you are.
Oh, that's cute,
but I can open my own doors.
Thanks.
Shall I put on some music?
Wow, you provide quite the service.
Don't tell me you've got individually wrapped Mentos
and Tyler water bottles in your glove box.
Oh, my God, you do.
Fulfilling my fantasy of dating my Lyft driver.
[GPS] In 500 feet, make a left.
No, you're gonna keep on the straight.
-The navigation said-- -No, don't listen to robots, listen to me.
[GPS] Recalculating. In 200 feet, make a right.
You need to make a left here.
Okay, so now pull over,
and here we are.
This is not your high school.
Wouldn't it be weird if it was?
Okay, so you can swing back and pick me up in a few hours.
You're telling me that you would rather hang out at a...
café book store than go to a high school dance?
Yes.
Oh, my God. Yes.
Yes, I would.
-Celia. -Gigolo.
-Brooks. My name's Brooks. -Sure.
-Brooks. My name's Brooks. -Sure. Look, you are my responsibility, and I cannot let you out of this car.
Look, you are my responsibility, and I cannot let you out of this car.
Okay, let's define terms here.
I'm not your responsibility, because Eisenhower isn't in office anymore.
Secondly, you're being paid to hang out with me.
Imagine how that makes me feel. Like, really, really imagine it.
Now do as I say.
Compensation aside, I think that you and I could have a really good time tonight.
You've clearly never been to my high school.
Fine.
Wow.
What?
Your hair looks really nice.
-Wow, this is your cafeteria? -Center for culinary participation.
Don't let the glossy sheen fool you,
the food still sucks.
I admire your ability to ruin moments. You do it with panache.
Why is nobody dancing? What, is dancing just a poor person thing now?
You think people actually go to a dance to dance?
No, they come here to take photos for their Instagram.
I'm sure that's why people have babies too.
-Okay, let's go shred some hardwood. -No.
-Yes. -No, no, no. -No. -Yes!
Okay.
What do you got going on over here?
I can't tell if you're doing Chandler Bing or Napoleon Dynamite.
Definitely Bing.
It's a good choice.
No.
-Come on. -No. -Come on! -No. -Come on. -No, no, no, no!
Bye.
-Oh! Ouch! -Hey! -Are you okay? -Yeah.
You just made me twist my ankle, you dipshit.
Sorry, I was kind of blinded by an angelic light.
It's fine, whatever, just now I'm on medical leave.
-Hey, come on, let me help you. -Hey, do not touch me. Thank you.
-Thank you. -Yeah.
Are you okay, Celia?
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
But now I can't run the charity 5K for canine diabetes this weekend.
Oh! Funny.
So, I'm having this intimate after-party thing at my place. You guys should come.
Yeah, I mean, that's...
She's, you know, but rain check?
That's a shame.
-I'm Shelby, by the way. -Brooks.
-Hi. -Hi. [laughs goofily]
Okay.
Well, what do you say there, Brooksie, my boyfriend,
my protector, my forever love, shall we get the hell moving?
-Yeah. It was nice to meet you. -Yeah, you too.
Bye.
[Celia] I mean, a baby in a gas mask?
Oh! Street art is a public disservice.
It's like streaking on a baseball field.
-Trashbug? -Yeah.
I see his stuff everywhere.
I'm pretty sure his next piece is gonna be the Mona Lisa, but with the fangs.
Trashbug, he's just some bored, privileged white dude, I know it.
How you doing, temperature wise? Are you comfortable?
You're a real professional.
-Like, is this your stock-in-trade? -No.
It should be. I'm telling you, you're really good at it.
Troubled rich girls in need of a chaperone, it could be big business here.
You really think so?
No, I'm joking. But, wow, you are super serious about it, huh?
Okay, you know I could...
I could provide a testimonial for your website.
Celia Lieberman says, "Brooks Rattigan stepped on my ankle,
but...
he got me ice."
Much appreciated, thank you.
Wait, hold on. Let me help you.
You seriously do not have to do that.
Wait, come on. Hold on.
I insist. You shouldn't have to walk to that door by yourself,
especially not with that ankle,
which has miraculously shifted to the other leg.
Huh?
Miracles happen every day.
I had to break into the kitchen to get you packs of ice.
-You're a sadist. -One of my more likable qualities.
I cannot believe that I missed Shelby's after-party
because of your dumb, fake ankle injury.
My fake ankle injury was not dumb.
My fake ankle injury was strategic and adorable.
You should be thanking me. You do not belong at Shelby's party.
Oh, really? Poor kid from Bridgeport doesn't belong at a Greenwich after party?
Whoa, I didn't even need to try to push that button.
We met, like, four hours ago, remember? I don't know where you're from.
I meant you don't belong there, because you seem normal.
The highest compliment one can receive.
Hey, you're back.
Disappear.
-So, how was the dance? -It was good.
-Oh, thanks for asking. -Right.
Your daughter is a very...
Do not try to define her, Brooks, it will mess up your early 40s.
Well, there's still the matter of the...
The bounty.
Yes.
You know what, take all of it.
-Are you sure? That's a lot of money. -Yeah.
You lasted three hours longer than we predicted.
You earned every Benjamin.
[Reece] All right, the exterior looks okay.
I mean, you got a couple of smudges right here, but,
it's not too big of a deal.
I don't get it.
Reece, we go to the same school, your parents aren't rich,
-how did you afford this thing? -Hey, dude...
Dude, some questions shouldn't be asked, okay?
-Yeah, my bad. -I'm kidding, bro, I'm kidding.
Calm down.
Honestly, it's in the hustle.
It's all in the hustle.
Come on, it is classic quid pro quo.
I get the app I need, and the money I need to go to Yale,
and you get to practice your craft, the art of coding.
-You haven't even been accepted yet. -Yet.
Look, worst case scenario, I take the money,
and I get ownership stake in this here fine establishment.
I can finally live out my eighth-choice dream
of a being a fast food restaurant owner.
What would you need exactly?
Okay, so I've been thinking and I think
that every date would be custom built by the user,
meaning that they could pick my personality, my interests,
whether I'm a listener or a talker, if I'm funny or serious.
Basically, I am a stand-in for whatever it is that they want.
Their dream come true.
If it was successful, that would look good on my college application.
So does this mean that you're in?
Yes!
I love you so much, Murph.
Wait, what time, what time is it?
-Uh... -Oh, tuna melt on seven grain!
Did you hear a ding?
I think the cheese delivery is here, would you go check?
-I didn't hear a ding. -No, I did, yeah.
-I definitely heard it. Go. Now. -Why are you rushing me, man?
Hi.
I'll take a tuna melt on seven grain, please.
Of course you will.
Is it done?
Have you ever tried to program an app on custom Objective-C infrastructure?
You're lucky I was able to salvage some of this code from another project.
Is that it?
It is done.
Murph, this is...
This is perfect.
Uh-huh. In terms of functionality, think GrubHub,
but instead of ordering Pad Thai,
they'll be ordering you.
And check it out, I created a secondary app that tracks your progress.
As you make more money, your avatar gets closer to your goal.
I'm calling it MyTraxx.
MyTraxx.
There's little Brooks riding it in there, he looks so innocent.
Yeah, but that's all in the past because you're a hooker now.
-What? No, I'm not. I'm a-- -I guess that makes me your pimp.
-A high-tech pimp, but a pimp nonetheless. -No.
I'm a gay teenage pimp,
wearing a secondhand hoodie. My life as I envisioned it.
I am not gonna be sleeping--
Yeah, I know, because if you did, we'd both go to jail,
which rhymes with Yale and yet is so different,
but you have your new rich friends to bail you out.
Okay, Murph, first of all, I don't have any new friends.
Okay? And second of all, I'm offering my services as a chaperone.
Whatever, man. What do we do now?
What one does when bringing a new product to market?
Talk about it incessantly on Reddit, until it sounds really important.
What is a Reddit?
-[chuckles] What's going on? -Breakfast for two.
Why?
Because families eat breakfast together, even really small ones.
Next year, when you're off to college,
I'll be a family of one, so now we eat pancakes.
Pancakes.
-Thank you. -Mm-hmm.
What is going on?
I haven't seen this look on your face since Mom let you buy a motorcycle.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself.
I saw it in the mail this morning and I just had to open it.
UCONN, you got in, full ride.
I know, you think you got in because I teach there.
Dad, you teach a continued ed night class, two Wednesdays a month.
I don't think that had anything to do with...
Look, I'm sorry, I just...
I haven't worked my ass off for the past three and a half years
to go to a public college, Dad.
Look, I gotta get to work.
I don't know how you managed it, but you ruined pancakes.
That's impressive.
Dear Office of Admissions,
My name is Brooks Rattigan
My name is Brooks Rattigan of House Wreck.
Murph, you Prince of Connecticut, you King of Reddit.
And of course, the whole abstract expressionist movement
really gained notoriety from Jackson Pollock,
whose, you know, influence is clearly present here.
♪ Like the back of my hand ♪
♪ I don't give a damn ♪ ♪ They kiss on the ring ♪
Suck it, Bill and Claire!
So, sports, right?
Isn't it interesting how many there are?
And how some use balls and some... don't?
And pucks. There's pucks.
Okay, I'm terrible at this.
I should just never go on a real date, ever.
No, no, no, no, you're doing great.
This is one small step for man.
Talk about what you want to talk about, not what you think I want to talk about.
Yeah, okay, that makes sense.
So, what do you want to talk about?
Um, well, this morning I did see a very large man walking a very tiny dog.
Oh, my God, I...
-I love it when that happens. -Me too.
-[message tone] -[beep] ♪ I got nothing to learn ♪
Howdy.
Hola.
Hey.
♪ I'm the man ♪
Brooks. Look, I'm not good at apologies,
but I feel I owe you one, because you're a gentleman
and pretty fun to be around. You were just doing your job, but you were pretty smug too,
You were just doing your job, but you were pretty smug too,
so it shouldn't be a whole apology, but a half apology,
so I'm half sorry, is that cool?
Yeah, I'm sorry, who's this?
Oh, Jeez, sorry, it's Celia. So do you accept my half apology or not?
Well, you are half forgiven, but fully admired for the effort.
Well, good,
because I'm in desperate need of your services.
Oh, God, what's your mom making you go to this time?
Is it a débutante ball? Ice cream social? Wait, let me guess.
Is it a horse auction?
Aha. No, yeah, that's pretty accurate.
No, there's this boy I like, Franklin.
Hold on, Celia,
you have a crush?
Is that so hard to believe?
Yes, it is. That's why you're hearing disbelief in my tone.
Just because I'm a little weird, doesn't make me less human,
in fact, it makes me more human.
So, there's this party at Shelby's house tonight--
Yes. Oh, my God, yes.
-A hundred times, yes. -Whoa, reel it in there, cowboy.
-A hundred times, yes. -Whoa, reel it in there, cowboy. I mean...
I barely wanna go.
Yeah, so I'm thinking, listen, we show up as a hot couple,
get Franklin a little jealous,
maybe you can stir up some attention from Shelby.
So, pick me up at seven.
It's a date.
And Celia, next time you require my services,
could you use my app?
Oh, my God, you didn't?
Oh, but I did.
[laughs] Okay, this is way more than a mints and tiny bottles of water.
This is a full-on bespoke concierge service. Yes, ma'am.
Okay, so what's the weirdest Brooks Rattigan you've been thus far?
I had a date the other night, where I had to just sit on this girl's couch
and listen to her talk for four hours straight, and all I was allowed to say was, "Yes, I agree,"
and all I was allowed to say was, "Yes, I agree,"
and "There's no other way to see it."
-My God, that is the perfect date. -There's no other way to see it.
Hey, thank you.
Son, a couple of things. The shifter sticks a little bit,
and the passenger window doesn't close all the way, so watch out for that.
And there's a spring in the seat cushion, so do not lean all the way back.
Wow. What, does Bruce Wayne live here?
You know, Shelby's dad's basically Batman,
if Bruce Wayne was a sleazy hedge fund manager
with a questionable sense of finance law.
You guys made it.
Hey.
-Uh, your place is amazing. -Oh, thank you.
It really makes me reconsider the allure
of living in a three-room house with a view of Target.
Oh, he's kidding, obviously. Brooks is from Darien.
Oh, my God, I love it there.
It's just so beautiful,
it makes this neighborhood look like a shanty town.
Could you excuse me for one moment?
It seems the family dog escaped his room.
Don't go anywhere.
I wouldn't want to get lost.
-Dad. -What?
Darien? Really?
Hey, this is Shelby Pace we're trying to impress here.
Either go big or go home, son.
Oh, my God, that's Franklin. Abort, let's go.
This is the whole reason that we're here.
I know, but I just didn't expect to see him so soon,
I thought I'd have some time to, I don't know, like clutch my bearings.
Relax. Okay, which one is he?
-Is he the guy in the yellow shirt? -Yes, stop being so obvious.
-He's cute. -Stop it.
Pretend to have a conversation with me.
We could also have a real conversation, that might be way less weird.
Fine, whatever, you start.
Where are you planning on going to college?
Uh, University of Michigan.
Wait, you're not going Ivy League? Isn't that, like, your birthright?
Wait, you're not going Ivy League? Isn't that, like, your birthright? Please, you see this?
This is the precise number of shits I give about the Ivy League.
Well, I give many more shits than that.
You know, if you want to go talk to him,
you should just go talk to him.
I know, I'm working up to it.
-This is ridiculous, come on. -Stop it.
You're making it worse by making a scene.
-You are such a brute. -It's one of my more likable qualities.
Have you seen this collection? She is a music fiend,
always going on and on about bands.
Bands that I've never heard of, so you know they're cool, right?
Not in like a mainstream way cool, more like a subversive.
Tell him.
I like music and records.
I like music and records. Me too. I mean, vinyl is the only pure delivery method, right?
Me too. I mean, vinyl is the only pure delivery method, right?
Yeah, I'm always saying that.
Music should only be listened to
on melted and then pressed vinyl discs.
There are kids our age, they've never even heard a vinyl record before.
[Celia] They don't know what they're missing,
or worse,
they do.
You know your girlfriend is over there talking to Franklin Volley?
Everything is so compressed on digital, it's like drinking a frozen OJ
Everything is so compressed on digital, it's like drinking a frozen OJ instead of a fresh-squeezed OJ.
Yeah, it's okay, we trust each other. I'm not really the jealous type.
-How refreshing. -Well, I aim to refresh.
-You're funny. -Me?
Most guys I know don't realize they can be both rich and funny.
Well, you can, I'm obviously living proof.
Hey.
They have a separate freezer for ice cream.
I was alone in the kitchen and started to applaud.
-Mm. -So, we have Boom Chocolotta
and plain old vanilla. Oh, thank you.
-Really? -Yo.
Don't knock vanilla, okay? It's a...
It seems a little boring, I give you that,
but there's a lot of nuance flavors hiding inside.
Kind of like you.
-Wow, so I'm vanilla. -Yeah.
Somehow you always manage to compliment and insult me at the same time.
It's a hereditary gift, on my mom's side.
Where's Franklin?
Oh, he's somewhere. I don't really wanna see that much of him.
-What? -Before our date.
What? Franklin asked you out? That's great.
No, actually, I asked him out,
because I am the master of my universe, and yeah, it's pretty great.
Oh, separate but related, it gives us a pretty good reason for our breakup.
-I see your game, you meet someone new. -Hit it and quit it, baby.
Okay, there's this huge birthday party that's supposed to happen in a few weeks,
and everyone's gonna be there, including your girl, Shelby.
Just the breakup has to be public, like very public.
Can you imagine if I date Shelby and get into Yale?
I mean, that would be it, that would be my dream come true.
Oh, God, I feel bad for you.
You're just relying on external factors for your happiness,
waiting for people  to accept you instead of accepting yourself.
I mean, what could go wrong?
Isn't that exactly what you're doing with Franklin?
-You're just jealous. -Of what?
Um, my connection with Franklin. It's more cerebral.
Um, my connection with Franklin. It's more cerebral. Please.
Like you're not at all interested in him 'cause he's hot.
Whoa, his brain is hot, okay?
I can just picture his gorgeous frontal lobe.
-Gross. -Yeah, that was unintentionally gross.
Fine, I like him because of his brains and, you know,
Fine, I like him because of his brains and, you know, the beautiful face that's attached to it.
There you go, so we're both shallow teenagers.
It would appear so.
-You're really sweet. -Yeah.
-Can I have some of that, please? -Whoa! No! No way.
[laughs] So, I might be able to help. My dad knows the president.
-Of what country? -Of Yale.
Um, they've been playing poker, like forever,
and I guess my dad's been losing to him for ten years,
in case I ever wanted to go.
So, the fact I don't wanna go is kind of a sore point.
I don't get it, rich people all know each other. -I don't even know who my barber is. -Okay, do you want my help or not?
-I don't even know who my barber is. -Okay, do you want my help or not? Yes. A hundred times, yes.
Well, no promises, but I can check with him.
What? Are you serious? Wow.
Thank you. All I got for you is wow.
Well, I'm a woman of much wow.
Hey, man, I'll give you 50 bucks for your car.
-Oh, you think that's funny? -Yeah, I do.
-Hey. -Hey. Whoa.
What's with the get-up?
Uh, I figured if I'm going to Yale, I'd better start stepping it up.
Hey, what's going on with all the late nights lately?
Uh, you know, the usual teenage stuff, school projects, dances, 24-hour raves.
Hm. Atta boy.
Do you think you could clean up one day? I mean, it's starting to look a little...
condemned in here.
I'm gonna get to it.
I could help you, if you want.
I think I do.
And actually, you have helped.
I submitted a collection of my short stories of this fellowship,
because you were so terribly and vividly mean to me.
So, thank you for being a supportive
asshole.
Anytime.
-Good night, Pops. -Good night, buddy.
Hey, look, little Brooks is almost a third of the way to his goal.
If I keep getting business like this, I'm gonna be at little Yale by the summertime.
That's great, man. Really.
What is that? What...
You seem distant.
Well, I guess I am.
We just usually have stuff to talk about, because we spend time together,
or we used to.
So, distance is making us distant, which makes sense to me.
But it's fine, really. We're gonna grow apart when we go to college,
so we might as well get the process started now.
Okay, well,
how about this?
I'm totally booked out tonight and tomorrow,
but I am completely free on Saturday and I will make sure it stays that way,
if you promise to go to Tino's with me.
Count me in.
Oh, hey, can we hit that new zombie-themed escape room afterwards?
Yes, I am in.
All right.
Hello again. -Hey, I'll take a-- -Tuna melt on seven grain.
-Hey, I'll take a-- -Tuna melt on seven grain.
Yeah.
-Uh, thanks. -Murph is my given name.
Oh, I guess I gotta give you this.
I just remembered that this is when you usually come by.
-Yeah. -We get paid a dollar above minimum wage,
so we're encouraged to provide top service.
Uh, well, thanks, Murph.
-What? -You were blushing.
Who is that? Huh?
Hey, yo, I work at White Castle, okay? You know what that means,
I see some of the finest bitches in the world every damn day,
and, Pops, I gotta tell you with the utmost respect,
your daughter,
she's got to be one of the finest bitches I have ever seen in my entire life,
and I've been to the Westminster Dog Show, okay? All right.
I have to take the browns to the Super Bowl,
and by that I mean I gotta take a hot deuce, right?
Daddy-o, where the bathroom at?
It's down the hall on the left.
I love you, baby.
Hey, Celia.
What's up, Vanilla? What are you up to?
I'm getting paid to be a douche to a girl's parents,
so that they're more accepting of her real boyfriend when they actually meet him.
Um, parents have it hard.
What are you doing tomorrow? Like early afternoonish?
What, for my best customer? I'm totally free. Why, what's up?
I may have got you an interview with the Dean of Undergraduate Admissions at Yale.
Oh, my God, Celia, I don't know what to say.
Well, why don't you try? Celia Lieberman, you make flowers blossom.
Celia Lieberman, you make flowers blossom.
You are the reason trees have leaves.
You are a goddess.
Aw! That is absolutely correct. -What time should I pick you up? -You shouldn't.
-What time should I pick you up? -You shouldn't.
This is your day, but it's my rules, so I'm gonna pick you up at one.
I'll text you my address.
Bye.
Woo hoo! Yo, man, that number two turned to a number five real quick.
Where the plunger at?
What? I'm trying to look smart. Do I look too smart?
It looks like someone took a J. Crew store,
put it in a cannon and shot it at your face.
Thank you, so much. I mean, what do I do?
I don't understand clothes.
They're completely irrelevant yet somehow important.
Lose the glasses.
Go on, give it to me. Okay, that's better.
Do you need the cardigan? I'm gonna answer that. You don't need it.
-I like the cardigan. -No one likes it.
-Intellectual people wear cardigans. -You do not look intellectual.
For the love of God, come on.
Oh, you know, what you do need though, you need a mani.
That is a fight for another day, my friend.
Wow, who would have thought that Celia Lieberman could be so comforting?
It's like underneath all these layers of angst and sarcasm,
there might actually be a human being.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey, relax.
All you gotta do is be yourself.
I mean, not this annoying, anxious version,
the better version.
I have been an astronaut, a cowboy and a douche, all in the past three days,
so I don't know which version of myself I'm supposed to be right now.
Brooks Rattigan.
Dean's ready for you now.
-Hi. -Hi.
-[Celia] Hey. -Yeah?
You're gonna kill it.
You know,
unless you don't.
Mr. Rattigan, a pleasure to meet you.
-Take a seat. -Yes, sure.
So, tell me about yourself.
Yeah, I'd love to.
What says more about a person than numbers, right?
So, the first time I took the SAT I got a 1510,
and that was because I butchered the math section, but
I knuckled down, and I put work over parties,
and I managed to bump it up to a 1570 on my second time around.
That's too bad.
I'm sorry?
Well, that you missed out on parties. Parties are fun.
It's important to enjoy life, especially at your age.
With respect, it's not exactly the message that we get from our parents and teachers.
I grant you that, yeah.
Well...
Mr. Rattigan, academically speaking, you seem like the perfect candidate for Yale.
Thank you, sir. Coming from you that means a lot.
But I want to know a little something about you.
Tell me something about yourself, activities, hobbies.
Sure, well I'm in French Club, I'm a National Honors Society, and--
Sure, well I'm in French Club, I'm a National Honors Society, and-- No.
No, I don't mean the things that you do,
because you think they look good on an application.
What are some of your interests outside of school?
Outside of school?
Example, I had a kid in here yesterday, right there,
and he breeds trash-eating microbes in his spare time.
It's fascinating stuff.
I don't... breed trash-eating microbes.
I don't really breed microbes at all, but I do have hobbies,
and interests. I mean, so many of those.
There is this thing, but I think you'll find it stupid.
There is this thing, but I think you'll find it stupid. No, what? What is it?
Well lately, I've been getting into
honey bees.
I don't...
I'm sorry,
did you just say, "Honey bees?"
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm a bit of an amateur beekeeper.
-I know, it sounds silly. -No, it doesn't sound silly at all, to me.
I'm a bit of an apiarist myself.
-No kidding. -Yes.
Wow, what a small world.
Tell me, what's your bee of choice? I used to be all about the Russian bees,
but then I found that their swarminess tended to be a little too--
Unpredictable.
Unpredictable, that's right. So, now I'm a Buckfast man all the way.
-They have so much more foraging zeal. -Yes.
Uh, and, you know, don't get me started on their resistance to tracheal mites.
Tracheal mites.
As soon as you get that application done, you bring it into me personally, okay?
-Not my secretary. -I will, sir.
-Sir, call me Delbert, please. -Okay.
And when you come by, don't forget to bring a jar of your honey.
As long as you bring a jar of your honey,
we can have ourselves a little honey swap.
Honey swap. [chuckling]
I love it.
It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Rattigan, truly.
The pleasure was mine, Delbert.
Thank you so much for setting this up. It went better than I could have imagined it.
Well, happy to help. Just...
just one little tiny question.
Why exactly are you guys swapping honey?
What, is that unusual?
I can't believe you.
What? I did some research before my interview, okay?
Hold on a second. What is the difference between me spouting a few beekeeping facts
and any of the Stand-In dates that I've been on? Huh?
You know that I'm not an art historian or a douche, right?
No, actually I don't know that, and this is completely different.
Those girls paid you to lie to them, and this time you did it all on your own.
Look, it is hustle, baby, pure hustle.
Oh, God, please don't ever say that again.
It did sound a little bit better coming out of Reece's mouth.
Wait, Reece? My cousin, Reece? What does he know about hustle?
It's how he got his BMW.
Brooks, Reece got his car because his dad started having an affair
with his sister's JV tennis coach, and his mom found out about it,
so she starts sleeping with the dude who owns a bunch of BMW dealerships,
hence the BMW.
-What, so no hustle? -No.
You're telling me
that Reece got a brand new BMW i8, because
his parents are shitty people?
Yeah. So, maybe you should rethink who your role models are.
-What about Shelby and Franklin? -What about Shelby and Franklin?
You don't know the first thing about vinyl, and I am certainly not from Darien.
Okay? These are the lies that both of us made up to get what we want.
Storming off, fantastic. That's what people who're right and not hypocrites do.
Speak more words and I'll hurt you.
-Maybe you're right. -About which thing? There were a couple.
Maybe I am a hypocrite, okay?
My parents say that I stomp around
in my boots looking tough...
to push people away,
because
I'm too scared to show people who I really am.
Oh, God, if anyone actually heard me saying this.
-Yeah, you know what I mean. -You're gonna be fine, okay?
You are Celia Lieberman.
And being weird and confident are not mutually exclusive elements to life.
You happen to be a master of both of them.
-Do you really mean that? -Yes.
-Thanks. -You are welcome.
So, I can Brooks' house from across the street,
and sitting beside the outgoing mailbox,
there's this big flimsy cardboard box,
with like 20 postage stamps stuck to it and just one word written across the top,
Idaho.
So, the mailman picks it up, and immediately the box gives out,
and little six-year-old Brooks slips out the bottom,
and hits the pavement like, "Bam!"
I'm hiding across the street watching it all, like...
-Just laughing my ass off. -Okay, wait, so what did you do?
I mean the only thing that I could do is "Good afternoon, Mr. Postman,"
and I grabbed my backpack and went back inside my house.
I can't believe you tried to mail yourself to Idaho.
-Thanks, Brooks. -Thank you so much. I got this.
-Thank you. -Yeah, of course.
-Nice guy. -Fancy man.
Okay, so of all places, why Idaho?
It's where his mom lives.
Yeah, she's married to some rich pediatrician
or rich plastic surgeon, rich pediatric plastic surgeon.
And they have two kids together
and every year they send Brooks and his dad a Christmas card
with a picture of her whole new family.
You know, which to me, seems totally screwed up.
[Brooks] See you, Tino!
-Was that tuna melt on seven grain? -If only.
-Uh? Tuna melt on seven grain? -It's nothing.
Murph here has a little crush on one of the Sub shop regulars.
We don't know his name, so we call him by his order.
He hasn't been in the shop for a week.
I think I scared him off by pre-making his sandwich.
Aw, you pre-made his sandwich?
-That is adorable. -Listen, you're gonna be fine.
He'll show up, and if not,
who cares, right?
You are going to find the right sandwich one day, my friend.
That is the lamest thing you've ever said.
-Yeah, but you're laughing, aren't you? -Get away from me, get away.
I'm glad someone's getting something out of my dating life.
Yeah.
All right, Godspeed to you on your date tonight.
Are you ready to
get some zombies?
I am.
But you seem unenthusiastic.
No, man. I got a request while we were eating.
Take it.
What? Are you serious?
Really.
All right, thank you. You're a really good friend.
Hey, good to meet you.
Yeah, you too.
-It was what? -It was, it was…
-[Brooks] Your insurance must be so high. -[Celia] Yeah.
[Celia] You know what?
Does the master have any advice for me, for my big date?
Yeah, I do actually.
-Good. -Don't dance.
-That is so offensive. Get out of my car. -I was just trying to help you.
You know, today was horrible
until it wasn't.
I agree.
Do me a favor, would you have fun tonight? Seriously, you're gonna dazzle him.
Unless you don't.
Get out of my car.
-I will drive off. -Okay.
-Right now. -I'm out. Have a good night.
[Franklin] The truth about coffee,
it's all in the grind.
It has to be precise or the water,
it seeps through the filter too quickly, and you end up with a weak-ass brew.
Wow, you know a lot about coffee.
Pour Over is an art form.
It's not like that overly processed swill you've got.
I don't know, I kind of like my overly processed swill.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to insult you. I ramble when I'm nervous.
Wait, did you just say you're nervous?
-Of course I am. -Why?
I don't know if this is a date or not, because you have a boyfriend.
Oh, Brooks is not...
Um, he is my boyfriend, and we are dating hard.
We're dating hard, but, you know, we have, um,
one of those advanced modern relationships.
We don't belong to anyone.
I watched this Nat Geo doc about dung beetles,
how they find their mates by analyzing the movements of a prospective mate's wings,
and if they move in the same specific way, they know they found their mate.
Watching you and Brooks, you move the same,
like a couple of adorable dung beetles.
Well,
we're not shit-eating beetles, though.
We're actually gonna be breaking up very soon. In fact, very soon.
We're actually gonna be breaking up very soon. In fact, very soon. -Okay. -Um-hmm.
So, I'm encouraged.
-Oh, hi. -Hey.
So, you're into vinyl,
and you're obviously very passionate about coffee.
What else are you into?
I'm passionate about a lot of things, most of all, my art.
That's cool, I like art.
-What's your medium? -The street.
No. Actually, you may have seen some of my stuff, like, around town.
Actually, you may have seen some of my stuff, like, around town.
What?
-Oh. -[whispering] I'm-- Don't say it.
I'm Trashbug.
You said it.
You said who you are.
-Are you familiar with my work? -Uh-huh.
Okay, you know how I did like a baby in a gas mask,
and I did like an old man in gas mask. Oh, yeah.
Right now, I'm working on something that is going to blow those away.
A cat in a gas mask.
It's a commentary on itself and on Dr. Seuss. I mean, cats don't wear hats.
That is
a very creative idea.
Dude,
Saturday night was insane. I just can't tell if it was in a good or bad way.
You think high school parties are crazy, they have got nothing on office parties.
I saw a drunk guy snort a line of printer toner.
Thanks again for letting me off the hook.
Wow, what a great image of our friendship.
I'm a fisherman,
reeling you in against your will to your death.
That's not how I meant it. How was your night?
I was alone, so I got paired with this group of drunk Germans.
They didn't speak a word of English,
so I wasn't included in any of the puzzle solving, and to top if all off,
a zombie, it got me in like the first ten minutes.
-The zombie actually bit you? -No.
One of the Germans did.
It's not funny, sorry, just...
[chuckling] It is a little funny. It's funny, if you think it's funny too.
But only if you...
-It's funny. Come on. -I gotta go to class.
Murph.
Murph.
-Hey. -No, you do not talk, I do the talking.
Excuse me? I trusted you,
Celia, and you chewed up that trust and you spit it in my face.
-Okay, what the hell is going on? -I'm practicing for the big show.
-Come on, did you forget? -Oh, yeah, our breakup.
So, I'm thinking that Shelby and Franklin need to be there when it happens,
So, I'm thinking that Shelby and Franklin need to be there when it happens, so when we go off on our own,
they're gonna wanna console us.
Oh, shit, I almost forgot to ask you, how did your date go?
Well,
it was the...
start of something great. I, for one,
am super happy for you.
I am also happy for me
too.
-Yay. -Okay.
Dope, see ya.
Yeah, I'll see you later.
I don't know.
You don't know what?
It doesn't really feel like me.
You look incredible.
-Hi. -Hi.
-All set? -Yeah.
Dressed to kill.
Nice.
You know, to kill our fake love.
Good, that's good.
Tight dress.
-High heels. -Cool.
A live python around my neck.
Sorry, I'm just trying to figure out what I'm gonna say tonight.
You're writing a breakup script?
Not a breakup script, more like breakup bullet points.
Oh, wow.
Celia, you look great.
Thanks.
Where's the snake?
-What's the plan? -Right.
Um, so I was thinking
you're gonna go in first.
You walk around, mingle a bit, do your thing.
Then, at exactly eight o'clock, you strike up a conversation with Franklin.
It'll play better if it seems like I'm catching you in the act.
You can put a gas mask on anything and have a real impact on people,
like Thomas Jefferson, Mr. Rogers,
the Pope.
The Pope.
That is brilliant. I gotta jot that down.
You know that story about the guy who has to push a boulder up a hill?
Every time it gets to the top it rolls back down
and he has to start all over again.
That's what talking to you is like.
Thank you.
So, you're saying I'm like Sisyphus?
[Brooks] Oh, my God!
You have a lot of nerve showing up here with him!
Okay.
-What are you talking about? -You know exactly what I'm talking about.
-I heard about your little date. -It was just coffee.
Please, to quote the great George Costanza, "Coffee is not coffee,"
coffee is sex.
Coffee is better than sex.
Especially from the rare Kopi Luwak bean.
You think you're so much better than me, Celia?
Better than everyone here, but I know the truth.
You're nothing but a hypocrite.
A fake.
-Hold on a second. -So you stomp around in those boots,
and you act so tough, but that's all it is.
-It's just an act. -Brooks, please don't do this.
A defense mechanism, see it's a poor attempt
at pushing people away.
You're afraid that if somebody got too close to you,
they might actually find out the truth.
That Celia Lieberman,
she's boring.
You wanna push me away? Go ahead, cos we're through, baby.
We are done, we are--
How's that for a defense mechanism?
God, I hate these shoes.
Celia.
Celia! My dung beetle.
[Shelby] Brooks.
-Hey, are you good? -Yeah, I'm fine.
Uh, physically I'm fine, but emotionally I'm...
a wreck.
I hate to admit it, but I kind of saw this one coming.
I mean, those two were being really chummy at my party.
Yeah, well I can be oblivious sometimes.
Thank you for rubbing that in.
-So, here's a question. -Yes, whatever it is, yes.
Will you go to formal with me?
I mean, do I have to speak or can you read my alarming fast heart rate? Yes.
Hold on, you guys have another formal? How many does your school have?
As many that are needed to fund the new stables.
Murph, you will never believe what happened to me. Shelby kissed me.
Oh, dude, congrats. I always knew you could do it.
-Who's Shelby? -Toby, why are you here? Where's Murph?
-We switched shifts. -Why? Is he sick?
I don't think so, because it wasn't just for today.
It was for like the rest of the year.
-Did he say why? -No.
Oh, yeah, you know what, he did say that you were a selfish prick
and that you only think about yourself.
You don't think that has anything to do with him switching shifts, do you?
[woman] I guess you think this is pretty pathetic...
going for a walk with some old lady.
No, I feel like I actually needed this.
My granddaughter set this up. I don't know the first thing about apps,
unless it's the Bloomin' Onion at Outback Steakhouse.
-Now that's a good app. -Mm-hm.
My husband and I did this every day for the past 20 years.
-He passed away in June. -I'm so sorry to hear that.
Oliver.
That was his name.
He was ugly as sin.
His face was weird.
He had the right sized face on the wrong sized head.
Ol' smushy face,
that's what I called him.
That's real nice.
I didn't care what he looked like.
He made me laugh, and I liked being around him.
You want to know how you can tell if you're meant to be with someone?
-Please. -It's simple.
Just sit and have a conversation.
Some people when you talk to them, it's like trying to listen to classical music
on a radio with no antenna.
You can push that dial back and forth all you want,
but you only get static.
But when you're meant to be with someone,
and they truly are the one,
you just sit,
start talking,
and a Beethoven sonata will begin to play.
You haven't mentioned the formal, Cel. It's tomorrow night.
Do you get a cut of the ticket sales or something?
-You are going, right? -I am actually.
-With whom? -Nobody.
I'm going whom-less.
What about Brooks?
I thought you guys were hanging out,
to use the parlance of your time.
Dad, no. I don't want to go with anybody.
Not Brooks Rattigan, not Franklin Volley, nobody.
-Okay? -Honey, listen--
No, Mom, can you listen?
I have the rest of my life to get hung up on relationships and dating,
and "Is he really into me?", and "What does this text mean?"
-And all that bullshit. -Celia.
Why is high school the time of your life
that you're expected to be good at everything?
I just wanna be whatever I am.
And I'm proud of that.
I just wanted you to have a better high school experience than I had.
Here we go.
-Group hug. -No, that's good.
-Group hug. -Please.
-Yep. -Oh, do we have to? Stop.
Wow.
You look incredible.
Thanks.
It only took three stylists, two hairdressers, one makeup artist,
Bioslimming active wrap, two hours of pilates,
and like 12 pounds of moisturizer to look this way.
Wow. I took a shower.
Hold on, wait, chivalry is not dead.
-All right. -Thank you.
You're welcome.
What's that smell?
We ordered our tuna crudo, like, ten minutes ago.
Yeah, it was a while ago.
So, Shelby, do you have any plans for after high school?
I don't know, it's tough.
I don't, like, have my whole life planned out or anything.
-Yeah, nobody does. -Exactly.
So, in the fall, I'll be going to Columbia,
where I'll major in applied economics in management with a concentration in finance,
and of course, I'll intern at my father's hedge fund over the summers.
Then, it's off to Harvard Business School, where I'll get my MBA.
I'll graduate, get some seed money
and then open up my own private equity firm, but...
after that, it's all kind of up in the air.
You really have to get your shit together, huh?
Right, yeah.
Yeah.
How about you?
-Me? -Yeah.
Well, I'm applying to Yale,
and then I'll...
Well, I've been obsessing over just
applying for so long, that I haven't even thought about what I would do if I got in.
-Seriously? -Yeah.
Yeah, but I'm 18.
I got time to figure out who I am and what I want to do.
You know what I mean?
No.
-Oh, no. -What?
It's your ex.
Is this gonna be weird for you? I mean, I personally don't care at all, but maybe you should?
I mean, I personally don't care at all, but maybe you should? No, it's fine.
Wow, she's a really bad dancer.
Yeah, she's the worst.
So, you wanna go get a table or... ?
-Yeah, sure. -[woman] Brooks?
It is you.
Leah, hi. What are you doing here?
I go here. Look,  I just really wanted to thank you,
you really helped me out a lot. If I hadn't used your services,
I wouldn't have been able to get with Larry, here.
-Hi, I'm Larry. -It's nice to meet you, Larry.
-Do you want to get that table? -Uh...
Wait, what do you mean, you used his services?
-This table right here. -His Stand-In app, Brooks for hire.
Isn't that what you're doing, Shelby?
Am I... am I paying somebody to go out with me?
God, no. Gross.
-Brooks? -Yeah?
What the hell is going on here?
I have a side...
business, where I go on dates with girls.
Why?
Wait.
You're not like a male prostitute or anything, right?
Like, what is it?
A male gigolo? Well, all gigolos are males, but not all males are gigolos.
Well, all gigolos are males, but not all males are gigolos.  Gee...
No, it's clean and innocent. I swear, it's...
I do it because I need the money. Shelby, I'm not rich. I'm not from Darien.
I'm just some poor kid from Bridgeport, who wanted to impress you.
I mean, look at you, you are smart,
and strong and beautiful, and you are way too good for me.
You're right.
I am too good for you,
and not because I have more money than you,
it's because I'm not a liar.
Hi.
Hey.
Where is your date?
She is elsewhere.
I told her everything.
Where's Franklin?
Oh, you know, he's somewhere.
Probably making sure no-one ever wants to be an artist again.
-You guys didn't work out? -No.
No, we didn't. You know, he's not really my type.
Turns out I'm more into oblivious,
self-absorbed pricks, you know.
Right.
Well, then,
would you like to dance?
No.
No, I wouldn't.
Why not?
Because I'm not your backup.
You're home early.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tonight didn't really go quite as I thought it would.
I'm sorry, kid.
-You wanna lay it on me? -[switches TV off]
I've been a stand-in.
I see.
And what do those two words mean in this context?
Well, I started a dating service app.
-What? -Yeah.
I was the date,
the stand-in.
I've raised quite the entrepreneur, huh? I mean, it was more just really...
school dances, and um...
art show openings. I went to a rodeo. Oh, yeah, the cowboy outfit.
-You saw that? -Sure did, pardner.
Damn, Brooks, you did all that just to raise money for Yale?
I'd have sold a non-vital organ, if I'd known it meant that much to you.
There's a reason God gave us two kidneys.
That spare kidney is just a rainy day cash cow, sitting there.
It wasn't really just for the money.
I went out on all these dates
and pretended to be whatever it was that these girls wanted me to be,
and pretended to be whatever it was that these girls wanted me to be, because, I don't know, I thought that...
I thought that maybe I would find out who I am, and Miss Track...
quite cruelly pointed out that I have absolutely no idea who I am.
Anyway, it didn't work.
Yeah, well who the hell knows who they are anyway.
We are all just figuring it out as we go along.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
So, the best you can do is
reflect on who you were in the past
and compare that to who you wanna be in the future,
and you split the difference. That's who you are now.
Like, I was a success,
and I wanna be a success again.
And I was a good husband,
until your mom left us.
She left me,
but you know what I didn't fail at? Is being a good dad.
Because of who you turned out to be.
I know sometimes you think I gave up and...
yeah, maybe there's some truth in that.
But I never gave up on you.
I love you, bud.
-I love you too, Dad. -I know.
-I'll be back. -Cool.
Not used to you being alone.
Yeah, well, I've successfully pushed everyone else away, so...
It occurred to me that I never would have been able to get
the Stand-In off the ground, if it wasn't for you.
And then once I finally got it to take off,
I shoved you out of the plane, so I am sorry.
It's not that big a deal, man.
I have an emotional parachute that I've been weaving together,
every day I've been alive. [chuckles]
But how goes that Yale essay?
It's paused.
I'm not the best judge of my words or my actions right now.
How's tuna melt? He came back to the shop,
so, good, I guess? Or, at the very least, not really bad.
He's not coming in for middle of the road sandwich cuisine.
I get it, you're intimidated,
he's taller, he's stronger, he's obviously better looking than you.
But you are the smart one, so you have got to make the first move.
So, I guess, let's both do better at what we have to do.
Yeah.
-All right. -All right.
Watch this.
Hey, Rattigan, dude, I heard what happened with you and my cousin,
and if it makes you feel any better,
I'll let you take my car for the weekend.
-No, I'm good. -Just kidding, I'm not...
-What? -I said, "I'm good." Thanks though, Reece.
-Really? -Yeah.
It's just a car.
Look, if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here.
Okay, I know it can be rough when your parents go through a divorce.
It makes you act differently, so....
Uh, what?
Hey, Celia.
Hey.
Thank you for saying yes to this.
Can I get you something, a coffee, or... ?
I don't know, I have a Pour Over.
Franklin was right, they're kind of divine.
Oh, God, no. No, thank you.
So, how have you been?
Good.
I'm good. I'm really good.
That's good.
Well, I killed the app.
Oh, that right?
Well, in the spirit of honesty, which is kind of my new thing,
I haven't quite been able to bring myself to delete it,
but I have denied all the requests that are coming in.
And the women of the world weep.
Not really. There's a couple of copycat apps that have popped up.
The market is getting saturated. I got out of the game at a good time.
-Good. -Yeah.
-It's nice to see you. I miss you. -Brooks.
Please, just don't, okay?
Hey, am I gonna read the admissions letter or what?
Yes, sorry.
I hope you didn't waste too much time on it,
because based on your meeting with the Dean,
you could have drawn a picture of a bee and gotten in.
I actually didn't apply to Yale.
-Wait, what? -Yeah, I accepted UCONN's offer.
Hold on, I thought Yale was everything to you.
Hold on, I thought Yale was everything to you. It was.
It was and then I realized
that if I have to pretend to be someone else to get in,
then I probably don't belong there.
You know?
Brooks, what is this?
[Brooks] Dear Admissions Office of the University of Celia Lieberman,
First off, I just want to say what an honor it is
just to be considered as a potential attendee at your fine institution.
And secondly, this feels really creepy writing to you
as if you're a university and not a person, so I'll stop that now.
A few months ago, I was a guy who carried around this empty feeling.
Then, I thought that it could be filled by
driving the nicest car,
dating the most popular girl, or going to the fanciest school.
But the closer I got to having any of these things,
the deeper that empty feeling got.
I've been so many people these past few months.
A cowboy, an art connoisseur, an amateur beekeeper,
a prep school wannabe, a bad friend,
an obnoxious son and a self-obsessed prick.
But through it all there were little pockets of air
when I felt like I was truly myself,
and that was when I was with you.
I don't know if you're accepting applications right now,
but if not, I am totally willing to be wait-listed.
[Dad] Hey.
I was gonna cook a steak, do you want one?
-No, thanks. -Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm good. -All right.
[Brooks] Hey...
you actually got some mail. I put it on the table.
Oh, boy.
Just what I need. It's probably another rejection letter.
This is...
It must be one of the grants I applied for,
the Visionary Writing Award.
Dear Mr. Rattigan, in recognition of your unparalleled literary talent,
we would like to offer you this grant to further your career as a visionary writer.
-That's incredible, Dad. -Yeah! That's how we do it!
Steak night. Boom!
I shouldn't have slapped you.
I mean, it felt great for me,
but I shouldn't have slapped you.
-No, I think I deserved it. -Yeah, you did.
And, you know, I'd do it again.
But I'd really like to not have to.
So, are you ready to go?
Go where?
Our date. I'm taking you to the formal.
Another formal? How expensive are horse stables?
It's just a shed over an animal.
No, I'm not going to another formal for as long as I live.
Come on, I'm not taking no for an answer and you know how stubborn I can be.
I do know that.
-Fine. -Good answer.
But wait, you left literally all the fields blank on the app, so
what kind of personality would you like for your date?
There were so many good ones.
But I think I'm gonna go with regular old
no-frills, vanilla ice cream Brooks Rattigan.
I think I can make that happen.
[Celia] Thanks, I got that.
-Nice of you to dress up. -Yeah.
I just... I do what she tells me to do. -Um-hmm. -Um-hmm.
[man] Hey, what's up?
Murph.
-This is incredible. -I know.
I can't take all the credit, the whole thing was Celia's idea,
and tuna melt is a whiz with décor.
What's his real name?
Oh, my God, you don't know.
How do you not know his name?
I keep hoping it will come up naturally and it never does.
I keep hoping it will come up naturally and it never does. And I can't ask him now, I'm in too deep.
Look, I know it's early, but if you're in need of a roommate next year...
No.
-Wait, you're going to UCONN? -I am.
I didn't think they'd accept me, considering my GPA is a bit iffy,
but I showed them some of my apps, and they were impressed.
Who told you the Stand-In would be good for both of us?
Not the Stand-In, they hated it.
-What? -They hated it.
They liked MyTraxx,
and I tweaked it to be applicable for student loans.
You know, which makes me a genius.
-Congratulations, man. -Hey, Murph, help me with this table.
Got it, uh...
man.
Hey, I can bear this wait no longer, you've gotta tell me.
Did I get in?
It was a tough call.
I mean, your essay was littered with sentence fragments and run-ons,
like, seriously, but,
after careful consideration,
the Admissions Board of the University of Celia Lieberman
is pleased to inform you that, yes, you are accepted.
-Come on! -Hey, don't get too excited.
You are on a probationary basis, okay? Like, one semester at a time.
Okay. Well, I'll take what I can get.
So, I mean, what are you gonna do to celebrate this acceptance?
There are a few things that I'd like to do.
Oh, inform me. What?
Well, one,
I really wanna do this.
And two,
I wanna do that again.
And three,
I want to dance.
Oh, you think you can keep up with me?
Well, I'd like to try.
Whoa!
Yes, Murph.
Actually, the princess was a nice girl
who lived in a huge house that she had inherited,
and half of her salary went to maintaining it.
The princess was full of optimism, dreams, hopes, and tons of carbohydrates.
dreams, hopes, and tons of carbohydrates.
But now, all that's left are the carbs.
How does a nice, good-hearted princess,
who is capable of eating a family-size pizza by herself, end up like this?
Just like everything that's wrong with the world, it's the fault of...
a man.
THE DAY BEFORE
-Hi, lovebug! -Hi, Fe.
Finally, my love!
I wasn't able to talk much these days, but I promise I'll make it up to you!
Listen, I want to talk to you about something.
I know that last time we were talking about how the distance sucks. It really sucks.
about how the distance sucks. It really sucks. We both get weird. Yes, yes. I want to talk to you about that.
And it's clearly making us feel weird. Of course we're going to feel weird.
Though I have to say the phone sex hasn't been bad.
Though I get nervous about the United States listening to our calls because... that's embarrassing!
-Fe. -What? What do you want to say?
I've been thinking. I don't know...
I'm sorry to say this here, okay? But...
I think that we need...
a break, okay?
A break?
-When? How? -A break.
-When? How? -A break. Look...
I think that we need more space.
More space?
Ten-thousand kilometers isn't enough for you?
Fe... you know what I mean. No.
Damn...
I'm really sorry.
I didn't want it to be like this.
I don't get it. Are you break--
Are you breaking up with me?
I think it's for the best. Seeing as I'm not--
I think it's for the best. Seeing as I'm not-- -Yes? What? -I think--
-I think we need-- -No. Hello?
-...space. -Hello? Hi? -It's not me... -Hello?
-It's not me... -Hello? Matías? Hello, Matías?
Matías? Hello, Matías? Hello?
They say that grief has five stages.
I went through all of them in one night. And over WhatsApp.
Hey, lovebug, honey. How are you? Listen...
Hey, lovebug, honey. How are you? Listen... I understand what you're going through, okay?
It will pass.
DENIAL
Besides, Mercury's in retrograde, the Moon's waxing, and we're all basically water! So take it easy, rest up, and call me when you're better so we can talk.
So take it easy, rest up, and call me when you're better so we can talk.
Kisses. I love you. Take it easy.
Are you seriously not going to reply? Really?
ANGER
Do you think this is what I deserve after six years in this relationship?
Huh? No! Well, I have news for you, Matías.
You're not the ideal size. Okay?
You're far from it! The ideal size is big! You idiot!
You screwed up! I'm never going to Madrid, and it's all your fault!
Who the hell buys a board game in Portuguese?
Fucking hipster!
You'll never play me like this again!
Listen, Matías, I've been thinking.
This can't happen again, okay? We can't disrespect each other like this.
This can't happen again, okay? We can't disrespect each other like this. It's a line we can't cross, okay?
BARGAINING
Now, I understand there are things that you don't like about me.
I don't know what they are. You never told me.
There are things I don't like about you, but I'm not throwing them in your face.
And if you want me to change, well, we'll talk about it.
And if you want me to change, well, we'll talk about it. Everything in life is change.
Then there's resistance to change, and then change again.
So if you want me to change, I will.
I'm willing to eat pineapple pizza, Matías.
I'm willing to eat pineapple pizza, Matías. WON'T YOU REPLY? I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS
Pineapple pizza.
DEPRESSION
I SEE THAT YOU'RE ONLINE
ACCEPTANCE
NETFLIX PRESENTS
If there is something positive about waking up in an empty bathtub, hungover, and with pizza in your hair...
in an empty bathtub, hungover, and with pizza in your hair...
it's the deceptive feeling that, from here on, things can only get better.
María Fe Palacios, you will not be that kind of girl.
She's not opening the door?
No, she already opened it. It's just that I love standing here,
waiting to grow gills with this lovely humidity, Santiago.
I love the humidity. Mexico is too dry.
Lima's climate is perfect.
You say that because you've only lived here for 45 minutes.
No, I've been here for three years.
And you still can't get rid of your accent?
We haven't seen each other since that time, right?
It's been ages! Go figure.
-Since Fe's party? -Since your ex-boss's going-away party.
You have such a good memory.
Fe!
So, are you here to have breakfast with my friend? Or what?
Yes, you, with a penis... Tell me, what do you have in there, where your heart is supposed to be?
Tell me, what do you have in there, where your heart is supposed to be?
I guess you received one of these, too.
Seven, and the last two were of her singing Alejandro Sanz.
Alejandro Sanz from the 2000s or the 1990s? From the '90s.
Hey. Hey, friends! What are you doing here? How are you?
What are you doing here? How are you? We've been calling you all day.
I didn't hear because of my headphones. -Can I borrow this? -Sure.
Did you come to take me to work?
We were worried, because of what happened last night.
Matías and I broke up, but don't worry. Everything's fine.
But thanks for coming, my friend. You're the best. I love you.
But I'm not gonna get dramatic like a 16-year-old girl, right? Life goes on.
-It's a new day. Let's go and get to work. -Hold on.
-It's a new day. Let's go and get to work. -Hold on. Are you sure you don't need to stay in bed, cry a bit,
Are you sure you don't need to stay in bed, cry a bit, or eat some ice cream?
Or fuck somebody? No, I really don't need any of that. What I need is to get to work.
Let's go. Think fast.
I got it. Okay, go with him. It's fine.
I got it. Okay, go with him. It's fine. -All right, that's the spirit. -Right!
I'll call you later so we can talk.
-I could sleep over. -I'm fine, my friend.
-Okay, don't drive fast. -Bye, beautiful.
Sure you're okay? -Stop it, I'm fine! -Okay.
I'm sure he likes you, he's always smiling...
Santiago, here's your decaf latte.
You're the best person in this office.
-After you! -My friend!
Don't kid yourself, it's not gonna happen. You never know.
-Let's go. -We're flanning. Flanning.
-Let's go. -We're flanning. Flanning. Let's get flanning.
Flan-tastic. -Flan-atic. -Flan-atic.
Let's start creating. The word flan.
Look at what I have, Ramiro.
If we want intrigue, we could launch something like...
-Flan, flan, flan, flan... -I like that. -Flan, flan, flan! -More of the same.
Wouldn't you like some delicious flan-ch toast for breakfast?
Good!
Give us this day... our daily flan.
-Fluorescent. -Yes, fluorescent.
-Fluorescent doesn't have "flan" in it. -The young lady's killed our creativity.
-What? Fine, I won't say anything. -Let's wrap this up.
-What? Fine, I won't say anything. -Let's wrap this up. Charly has something to say.
I was saying that, once again, -we have exceeded expectations. -Exceeded!
-we have exceeded expectations. -Exceeded! The cocktail potato campaign has reached 50,000 views.
The cocktail potato campaign has reached 50,000 views. And not just that, the hashtag that we created is trending.
And not just that, the hashtag that we created is trending. Trending topic!
-Gastón himself shared it. -Gastón!
Very good! Congratulations, genius!
Thanks, Rami. A round of applause.
-Applaud. -Give him a hand.
We're working on something for Cannes. Diego, make sure that account planning inflates the results to show more sales potential. Mafe, what are you up to?
to show more sales potential. Mafe, what are you up to? I've just finished the campaign for the cream, Smoothness.
You did what I said, right? You used women's empowerment and all that?
Yes, "smoother skin, stronger women."
Add some color to it, add some flowers, make it look more feminine.
He can help you.
Nobody makes fun of them here. It's not contagious.
Just joking, okay?
-You're doing the pads? -Yes. I finished the campaign.
-You're doing the pads? -Yes. I finished the campaign. A small one for Facebook, but it's ready.
-So you can take the cooking oil campaign. -The cooking oil!
-So you can take the cooking oil campaign. -The cooking oil! It's a good one. It has flavor, it's got personality. You'll like it.
It's a good one. It has flavor, it's got personality. You'll like it.
It's also street-smart. Great. Let's do this, babe.
It's also street-smart. Great. Let's do this, babe. Let's make it tasty.
Give it some spice.
Now, I have to choose...
which of you will be in charge of our new client's campaign. The annual and regional campaign.
The annual and regional campaign.
Who's up for it? Rami, Charly and I are very busy right now.
No, we're not very busy. In advertising, you can't be too busy.
There's no such thing. I'm going to tell you a story.
The year was 1994, and I thought I was too busy.
I was assigned Coca-Cola's regional campaign. Coca-Cola, okay?
I created it while I was in the shower. Boom! It was a hit.
I created it while I was in the shower. Boom! It was a hit. Five Golden Lion Awards. I thought I was too busy.
Five Golden Lion Awards. I thought I was too busy. Excuse me, Ramiro, but I'd like to do that campaign.
Excuse me, Ramiro, but I'd like to do that campaign. You're too busy with the cooking oil.
-Who can do it? -I can.
-But you're... -No, I'm done. I just finished it.
That's enough!
-Mafe will do it. -Great. What's the product?
Tissues.
It's what women like. Time to cry, honey.
It's what women like. Time to cry, honey. Sound good?
There is one thing you can always count on,
and that is the universe's twisted sense of humor.
Fe...
I left six months ago, and you still haven't fixed that door?
Are you waiting for me to come back and fix it?
I like it like this.
Yeah, it gives it an air of... I saw it on Pinterest.
This isn't happening. He's not here. He's in my head.
In my head... It's in my head.
Are you watching Game of Thrones without me?
-That's sacrilege. -Listen...
You've got some nerve. You broke up with me. I can watch any series I feel like.
Yeah, but this is like pure hate. Are you declaring war against me?
Yeah, but this is like pure hate. Are you declaring war against me? Sorry, there's nothing you can do.
I can show up every time there's a sex scene. So I can remind you of when we...
This is the best bed in the world.
Holy shit...
Remember the first night we slept in this house?
There was only this mattress. There wasn't anything else here.
Not even a table for us to eat on.
But I opened a bottle of wine...
and we just talked for three hours.
And then I couldn't stop laughing because we spilled the wine.
We spent hours cleaning that up.
We threw salt on the rug, right?
I always remember that, too.
You've been getting me out of bed for two weeks at 11 p.m., and you make me come over.
I can't do this anymore. I'm serious.
I'm sorry.
Look, I know you're going through a rough patch.
It's shitty, I know.
But, know what I think?
You shouldn't live here by yourself. This house is too big. That's why you're like this.
Why don't we look for a roommate?
-Move in with me. -No. -Please. -No way.
We'd kill each other. We wouldn't last one week.
Besides, I've just renewed my lease. I can't. Fine.
I can help you find a roommate if you'd like.
We can set up interviews. How about it?
No, I'm fine like this, really.
No, I'm fine like this, really. I'll get over it.
Okay, help me find a roommate.
Yes, tomorrow.
-Are you serious? -Yes, please.
Hi, Romina, how are you? I'm Natalia. -Hi! -Nice to meet you.
-Hi! -Nice to meet you. -Honey, no... -What? You have something on your face.
Are you two... a couple?
-No! -No.
20,0000! #ILoveEveryone. #BlessedAllTheWay.
Because we owe it to our audience. Right? It's super crazy.
They pay you to post photos on Instagram?
Of course! And they give me free clothes. Like these. Don't you love them? I can give you some.
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't think they'll fit you.
There's, like, a leak here, right? -What? -Look at my hands. My hands got wet.
-What? -Look at my hands. My hands got wet.
-There's no pipe here-- -Oh, isn't this dishcloth a bit sticky?
-Maybe... -I'll wash it.
So which of you would move in here? -Both of us. -Both of us.
Oh, honey, we said it at the same time.
I'm sure a brand could get confused one day and send me an XL or large. I'd be happy to give it to you.
You have to wash this now, or else...
Watch out!
Didn't you see that fly?
-Is he your husband? -No.
What's this? How crazy!
You're so funny.
-Wait. -Hey.
There was something dead there. Now there are living things. Name them.
We'll have to use your room so we're more comfortable.
-Isn't that right, my love? -Yes. Whatever she says.
So you lived together, but weren't married.
Yeah, that's normal, right?
Yes, don't worry. I'm not judging you.
But God is.
What is this? It's cute.
The parties here have to end before 8 p.m. I have to go to bed on time.
We don't throw a lot of parties.
-Hey. She stole my magnet. -What?
-She stole the magnet! -I swear. -Tell her to give it back. -You tell her!
It's fixed. You won't have any more issues with your pipes.
Thank you, Santi. That's great. I love you. Thanks, you're the best.
Why the long faces? Was it really that bad?
Yeah, looks like I'm gonna live alone.
So I'll have to adopt birds and be the crazy bird lady.
Don't exaggerate, some of the candidates were okay.
-Which ones? -The guy from the gym, for example.
-The one who wanted a threesome? -I like him.
The rich girl who has a yacht.
She asked what time breakfast is served.
Well, Fe, what do you want me to say? Our parents are right. Our generation is screwed.
Our parents are right. Our generation is screwed.
-It's social media. -Totally.
-Come in, please. -Thank you.
Hello.
-Hello. -Are you María Fe?
-Yes. -You look like a María Fe. -Hi, how are you? -Good, good.
-Hi, how are you? -Good, good.
Hi. -Santiago. -You're a Libra.
-Santiago. -You're a Libra.
This is a nice place. It's really beautiful.
This is a nice place. It's really beautiful. Good vibes. Oh, except for this couch.
Good vibes. Oh, except for this couch. Somebody cried here.
That's powerful.
-I'm Natalia, María Fe's best friend. -Sorry. How are you?
How are you, beautiful?
-Good. And you are? -Caro, Carolina.
Caro or Carolina, either is fine.
I'm a vegetarian. Sometimes I eat chicken, but I'm a vegetarian.
I do yoga every day at 7 a.m. I wake up super early. Except Wednesdays. They're yellow, so I can't.
Except Wednesdays. They're yellow, so I can't. Of course.
I don't believe in long-term relationships. But I do believe Paul McCartney is dead
and the man who passes for him is a double. Just like Avril Lavigne.
-I'm going. -It's a... We're having a problem with the pipes, but he'll fix it.
Everything happens for a reason, no worries.
How beautiful.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I brought you all something to try.
I brought you all something to try. Thank you.
-They're the best brownies in town. -Thank you.
-Did you make them? -Yes, I made them.
Don't worry, there's no pot in them. I have pot for later if you'd like,
Don't worry, there's no pot in them. I have pot for later if you'd like, -but that doesn't have any. -Okay.
I'm having a mouthgasm.
These are definitely the best brownies I've ever tried.
That's another thing about me, I always tell the truth.
-And... -And...
Caro, when could you move in? Carolina...
Everything's fine.
I'm fine with moving in now. I think you guys need help, right?
You're so good at that. Plants always die on me.
-But you paint furniture beautifully. -Thanks.
This whole gardening thing gets me very nervous.
-But do you paint? -No.
I've never followed Dr. Miyagi's practices.
Mr. Miyagi. Miyagi was a mister, not a doctor.
Mr. Miyagi. Miyagi was a mister, not a doctor. -It's Mr. Miyagi. -I'm sorry.
-It's Mr. Miyagi. -I'm sorry.
Could you help us -and paint the walls? -No.
-and paint the walls? -No. You could ask your boyfriend to help.
You can relax a bit and get off the computer.
Hey, how many of these have you smoked? Who said I have a boyfriend?
Hey, how many of these have you smoked? Who said I have a boyfriend? Isn't the Mexican your boyfriend? The one who curses with a Mexican accent.
Isn't the Mexican your boyfriend? The one who curses with a Mexican accent.
There's no way I'd be with him, carnal.
He's a cute guy, isn't he? I mean, he's got good energy and all that.
I mean, he's got good energy and all that.
Yeah, but don't insist. She doesn't like those things. She's like that.
He's a player. Anyway, I think he's kind of dumb.
-You liked him the first time you saw him. -Caro, are you seeing anyone?
-You liked him the first time you saw him. -Caro, are you seeing anyone? Yeah, two or three people, depending on the situation.
I like connecting with as many people as possible.
And you? How long have you been with your boyfriend for?
No, we're not together anymore. We lasted six years.
-Oh, six years? -Yes.
That's how long a squirrel lives. What happened?
He's an architect. He helped me fix the house up.
He's an architect. He helped me fix the house up. And he went to Spain to get his master's degree.
And distance always gets in the way. But I think it's a phase, and he'll get over it.
But I think it's a phase, and he'll get over it.
-Are you okay? -Yes.
Let's take a selfie so people can see we're doing things.
-Great! -Yeah.
Okay. We're all happy, right?
Okay.
-Great, thanks. -We're done.
Be careful, this leaves a horrible stain.
-I'm going to tag you, okay? -Okay.
DANIELA GARCIA ARCHITECT AND ANIMAL LOVER
THE BEST PART OF THE SCHOOL YEAR
Thanks.
Another one.
Stupid!
We're here with a very special guest.
His name is Matías. How are you, Matías? You're with a really, really cool girl. And she's very beautiful.
You're with a really, really cool girl. And she's very beautiful.
Her name is María Fe. Please, tell us... What do you like most about her?
Her ass.
But tell us about better things, qualities. My qualities as a person.
You make an amazing breakfast.
Scrambled eggs are my specialty.
You have no idea how she scrambles my eggs. It's delicious.
Are you going to miss me a lot?
-A lot. -Yeah, you promise?
I'll finish my MA and come right back.
It was at that exact moment that I understood what I had to do.
Remember how I told you that I wanted to handle this in a mature way?
That I wanted to calm down... -Yes, an admirable decision. -No, it was really stupid.
-Yes, an admirable decision. -No, it was really stupid.
It's not right. Who needs to be mature right now? Do you know what we need?
-To sleep for eight hours. -No. Tequila is what we need, sisters!
Tequila, sisters!
Stay away from me, Satan!
You know you want it, grab it. Let's do the ritual. Grab the salt.
-Start thinking about your... -Thanks, start there.
-Okay, concentrate. -Concentration.
To all the women...
who have made a mark on our lives.
My Aunt Monique.
-To Susy, my inspirational muse. -And to La Tigresa del Oriente.
-Cheers! -No, wait.
To Britney.
She is overcoming all the damage Justin did to her.
She is overcoming all the damage Justin did to her. You're doing good, sister. Keep at it. We've got your back.
You're doing good, sister. Keep at it. We've got your back.
-Cheers. -No, wait!
For that day to come...
That wonderful day when we'll learn to reproduce by ourselves,
That wonderful day when we'll learn to reproduce by ourselves, like the amoebas.
-Cheers! -Wait! I'm almost done.
And for that other day to come...
when we'll only need men for the little things.
Which means minimal things.
For example, opening jars,
reaching for things when you don't have a step stool,
killing small insects that scare us.
They scare us so bad, sisters! Cheers!
That's it, we're ready.
Never have I ever had sex with two best friends.
Drink!
Never have I ever had sex with girls and guys and vibrators, and stuffed animals.
and vibrators, and stuffed animals.
I've never edited a nude photo before sending it to a guy.
Never have I ever... sent an email and had it bounce back.
Never have I ever pooped in someone's bathroom,
had the toilet not flush, and had to grab the poop with my hand and throw it in the trash.
Drink!
I never hooked up with a teacher.
-I never did that! -Yes! In the parking lot!
He was my math teacher from prep school.
I asked him to explain square roots.
And how he took me to the millionth power!
Drink!
-Does a yoga instructor count? -Yes, it does. Cheers!
You know what we should do? Dance. Yes, where should we go?
There was this one place. Isn't there a place close by...
Was it Teatriz? -It was over here... -I think it was Zoom.
-It was over here... -I think it was Zoom.
I'll just type in "Barranco." And we'll look around there.
Where are all my people from the Bridge of Sighs?
What's up? No!
Idiot!
Who knows how to party better, men or women?
-Women! -Women!
#HOWYOUTHINKYOULOOK
#HOWYOUREALLYLOOK
-Excuse me. -Sorry.
-Sir. -Sir, please. I'd like the same drink.
-Just what we need. -Can we have that?
Excuse me. Go take care of your kids.
"Go take care of your kids"?
-That was so disrespectful. -That was too much.
I'm getting a chilcano cocktail.
No, you know what pisco does to you. No way... -Rum? -No.
-Vodka? -No, get some water.
-Come on. -No. I'll be right back.
Oh, we lost her.
It sucks that it's daytime in China. -I have to get this. -Are you serious?
-I have to get this. -Are you serious? Stay here, don't move. I'll be back. I need to play sober.
Stay here, don't move. I'll be back. I need to play sober.
Remember when we danced to this song?
Sir, a pisco, please.
-Chilcano? -No, a shot!
You know that's going to be bad for you.
María Fe? María Fe, are you there?
Hey, don't cut the line! -Don't cut the line! -Don't cut the line!
My best friend is in that bathroom calling her ex.
Go ahead.
María Fe?
-I'm sorry. María Fe? -Fe!
-Oh, shit. -What happened?
María Fe, drop that phone.
Fe, don't text him. -Give us the phone. -You'll regret this tomorrow.
-Give us the phone. -You'll regret this tomorrow. When you're sober, you'll regret this.
When you're sober, you'll regret this.
Tequila: six. Whiskey: two. Pisco: one.
Calls to your ex: one. Dignity: zero.
-Hey. -Hey.
Did the tequila help?
Here you go.
It has no sugar. I sweetened it with dates.
Those are coconut flakes on top. No flour, either.
Those are coconut flakes on top. No flour, either. There's nothing in it. I mean, it has other things.
There's nothing in it. I mean, it has other things. -Thanks. -Help yourself.
It's delicious.
I know it doesn't seem like it, but...
I also know what it's like to have a broken heart.
Let me guess, a guy?
It doesn't necessarily have to be a guy, right?
When I was 19...
I had to go back to my mom's house.
I lost my job and had to go back to my mom's house.
And she was married to an idiot.
To a disgusting drunk.
And one day, I was asleep...
and he came home drunk, as usual.
And he got into my bed.
No, I'm fine. Nothing happened to me.
What I mean is...
That's not what matters. What matters is that I went to tell my mom, and...
and she didn't believe me.
So I left.
-I feel silly now crying over a man. -Don't worry.
All sadness hurts, right? It's just a different hurt.
Your six-year relationship ended over Skype.
Your six-year relationship ended over Skype. It sucks, but it'll pass. You'll be fine.
It sucks, but it'll pass. You'll be fine.
I think that, right now, you should focus your energy on something else.
When this happened to me, I started doing yoga.
-The yoga was awesome. -Yeah.
Einstein said that life is like riding a bicycle.
To keep your balance, you need to keep moving forward.
-That's it! -Yep.
So, should I ride a bicycle or do yoga?
No, do pole dancing.
-Pole dancing? -Yeah.
Let's start with a beautiful move, the witch.
We have to think about it, have it clear in our minds. We visualize it in...
three... two... one.
And we have the witch. That's it.
That's it. We hold our beautiful witch.
Hold that pelvis, keep your smile. And now, the angel.
If we can't remember how to do it, we can look at the advanced students.
That's it.
One... and dolphin. That's it.
Feet together, with a princess smile.
And exponential self-love.
That's it, beautiful. Let's keep trying.
-I got it! -Yes, there you go.
We hold it for ten... nine...
eight... seven... and smile...
eight... seven... and smile... That's it.
Chess player, that's my thing.
The queen is the most important piece here. And the only one that can move wherever she wants to.
How about that?
For you, the Beyoncé of chess.
There are few games in which I've learned as much as I have from most of my mistakes.
Well, of course my queen was captured by a pawn!
So typical...
This is wonderful and addictive junk. I don't get why you don't sell them.
It's not junk, and it's not addictive. It has coconut milk, and it's healthy, so help yourself.
I'm sorry, but you'd be a millionaire. Thanks, I'll pass. I'd rather cook for you. With love. That's it.
I want to see Matías's face when he sees that I-by-myself.com fixed that cabinet door.
My God, how much longer do I have to hear that name?
Fine, I'm sorry.
-Want some? -Thanks.
You should keep yourself busy with something else.
For your own good and for ours.
Carolina, defend me.
I'm keeping myself busy.
-Really? -Yes. I'm doing a bunch of things.
-Like what? -I colored mandalas, I painted the walls, I just fixed that cabinet.
What else did I do? I played chess.
-Wow. -I read Don Quijote again.
I tried pole dancing.
Oh, please, tell me how that went.
Humiliation is not the best therapy.
She did well. She just has to keep practicing.
Thanks.
Usually, you're a smart slacker, but now, you're just a slacker.
Keep insulting me, please. You empower me.
I'm not insulting you. I'm making a dessert. I'm inventing it.
-Should I continue? -Please.
Fine, I'm insulting you. Hearing you makes me grumpy.
-Sorry. -Thanks. Please continue. You have to stop, Fe. I'm serious.
-Enough. -What's your problem?
You're not a kid anymore. We're adults now. Life is passing by.
When will you do what you've always wanted to?
You know what I want? I don't. Tell me.
What?
When did you decide to spend your life writing commercials? I don't get it.
-Are you making fun of my job? -No!
In high school, you wanted to be a writer.
She was the only one who knew what she wanted to do. I had no idea, but she did.
I had no idea, but she did. And she won at everything.
Now you say you don't know what to do with your life.
-I don't. -You say you're sad, you're going to die. You want to play chess...
All because that dwarf left you. You can't be serious.
I don't know what to write about, Natalia. I don't know where to start.
Well, start by sitting in front of a computer.
Like this, because things won't write themselves.
So, I just sit at the computer, and a masterpiece will happen.
You always said you wanted a blog. Where's the blog? Huh?
-Blogs aren't even trendy anymore. -Of course they are.
-So write one, for fuck's sake! -I don't know what to write about.
-So write one, for fuck's sake! -I don't know what to write about. -I don't know. -Of course you do!
I don't know! I swear, I have no idea.
The only thing I have in my head is that unnamable insect.
And how I want his intestines to rot and pus to come out of them.
And for him to have to call me to take care of him
and make him hot chamomile tea so he can sleep well.
After that, I feel bad and I lose all my dignity
for wanting something bad to happen to him. I wanted him so much, I loved him so much.
I wanted him so much, I loved him so much. And then I feel worse because I'm the protagonist of a shitty comedy.
because I'm the protagonist of a shitty comedy. Where God and the Devil, and all the people or beings in charge of making me feel bad
and all the people or beings in charge of making me feel bad spit at me with their black humor and make fun of me.
And you can handle all of these things.
You have this wall around you that won't let you feel anything. But I'm going to end up alone.
And I'll go crazy.
I'll end up crying in the street somewhere.
If you see me in the street crying, please pick me up.
At least do that.
If all of that was in a blog, I'd definitely read it.
WRITE A NAME CREATE BLOG
Have you ever gone out with one of those insecure idiots
Have you ever gone out with one of those insecure idiots who aren't acrylic or oil paint?
Well then, you've had the pleasure of meeting a watercolor.
This kind of man requires a lot of work.
The cup with water, the paintbrush,
and in the end, it's not even decent paint.
"Sex and Ceviche."
I don't know if that's genius or disgusting.
No.
"A Crisis of Fe."
That sounds like a Christian channel show. No.
HOLLYWOOD'S NEWEST AND MOST DESIRED BACHELORETTE
"Soltera Codiciada."
No, I'm not available. I'm sorry. Oh, thank you.
How's that presentation going, beautiful?
Very good. Good.
Don't forget, I want a presentation like...
-I hate him. I don't get it. -Me neither.
He talks like he's Argentinian, then Peruvian.
-He sucks. -Totally.
I really don't like him.
What is it, Natalia? I'm working.
Excuse me, am I speaking to Soltera Codiciada?
How do you know? First, because you write how you speak.
Second, because the watercolor idea came up when I broke up with stupid Nico.
And third, because it's all over Facebook. What are you talking about?
Wait, I'm going to look. I'll call you back.
Friends, I need to tell you something.
Friends, I need to tell you something. I started a blog.
-What? -A blog? Yes, "Soltera Codiciada."
What are you saying? Wait. Apparently I have...
Wait. Apparently I have...
What? My blog has 300 views!
I don't even have 300 friends!
Sorry. I don't even have 30.
I might not even have three, but I have you two.
-Oh, my friends! -What's going on? Is this a market?
Do you want your paychecks or not? Let's get to work.
-Share it with me. -I want to share it.
"I think I've only been with crayons in my life."
"I love you, Soltera." I love you, too.
"You should talk about the guys you meet on Tinder."
Well, first, you need another profile picture. This one's horrible.
What's wrong with you? This one is fine. I look fun.
Tinder is not a place for fun people, María Fe.
-No? -That's what Twitter is for.
Tinder is a place for people to have sex.
-It's sexual. -Oh, that's gross. -Come here. -Okay.
I'd suggest you change it to...
-My God. -Don't make fun of me.
-This one. -Don't look. -Don't look at it. -It's perfect.
-Don't look at it. -It's perfect. Listen, it's from three years ago. I'm dressed as a sexy nurse, no.
Listen, it's from three years ago. I'm dressed as a sexy nurse, no.
That's what we want. You should look sexy.
-This is the one. Do you trust me? -Okay. Yes.
-Okay. -Okay, let's see. Look at our options.
-That one with the beard! -He's gay. Really? Okay.
This one. Oh, I super liked him! What will happen? Will he know my address?
What will happen? Will he know my address? It's okay.
-Relax a bit. -I'm relaxed. -Relax more. -It's for research.
-Relax more. -It's for research. It's normal, I'm just getting to know the app.
It's normal, I'm just getting to know the app.
Another one. That one, Fernando!
No? Which one is Fernando?
If it's a group photo, it's always the ugliest one.
-This one, right? -Him?
-Sure. Let's see. -Okay. -Look him up. -Lorenzo, 27 years old. He's a surfer.
-Look him up. -Lorenzo, 27 years old. He's a surfer.
-He doesn't look like a psychopath. -No, he won't hurt me too much.
-He doesn't look like a psychopath. -No, he won't hurt me too much. -No. -Okay.
-It's a match! -Chat with him and have fun.
Okay, and what should I write?
I usually go right to the photo.
-A photo? -Yes. -A selfie. -A selfie?
-A selfie. -A selfie? -Naked? -Step by step.
-Naked? -Step by step.
Let's say you start with your face.
-The face? -Then the neck. Then you keep going down.
That's so kinky!
-It works for me. -Don't be like that!
Being single is an eternal search for the...
the perfect balance.
Shaving just in case it happens. Or not shaving so it doesn't happen.
Putting enough makeup on to look great.
But not enough to make it look like you tried too hard.
Thank you.
You're so sweet. No...
I had no time to dress up. I'm just so busy. But thank you.
And above all, look like you have everything under control.
Even though you have no idea what you're doing.

Lorenzo?
How are you? Hi. I didn't recognize you.
You look different in your profile photo. Yes, it was my best photo and my best age.
-María José. -María Fe.
Sorry, I confuse those Christian names.
María José, María Fe, Magdalena...
-I got you a caramel macchiato. -Thanks.
My female friends love it, so I got you one.
Caramel macchiato?
Once, I put milk in your coffee. You almost killed me.
He doesn't know.
-I don't know what? -Oh.
-I don't know what? -No...
-I don't know what? -No... I was saying I don't know what kind of work you do.
I was saying I don't know what kind of work you do.
But now I remember your profile photo, and it looked like you enjoy surfing.
That's so great! It's so cool.
That's so great! It's so cool. I'd love to go surfing one day.
It's amazing. I loved it the one time I did it.
You don't do it all the time?
No, you have to wake up at 5 a.m., buy your own board, and know how to swim.
-Well, you're not a nurse either, are you? -Shut up.
-Well, you're not a nurse either, are you? -Shut up. -Should I shut up? -No, not you. What I meant is that...
-Should I shut up? -No, not you. What I meant is that...
If you don't like surfing, what do you like doing? -What do you do? -I'm working on an app with a friend.
-What do you do? -I'm working on an app with a friend.
Cool, and what's the name?
That doesn't matter, she's a know-it-all. She's annoying and fat.
I was asking about the app's name.
-Tostadapp. -Tostadapp?
Yes, "Tostada App." -They share the a. It's "Tostadapp." -Tostadapp.
-They share the a. It's "Tostadapp." -Tostadapp.
What's Tostadapp about?
It's an app you can download for free. You have three options to put on your tostada.
Butter, jam, and honey.
You must be thinking that it makes no sense.
I was wondering if it's a joke or not. The money comes later. You get hooked on the app,
The money comes later. You get hooked on the app,
you can buy another upgrade, but it costs $20.
Then, you have whatever you want. Avocado, ham, cheese, turmeric...
And if you're really hooked, then you can add...
Do you like muscle relaxants?
No, I'm allergic.
Are you serious? You want to forget me with this idiot?
BALANCE
Yes, you haven't forgotten him.
And in this exact moment, you have this overwhelming feeling that you won't be able to.
you have this overwhelming feeling that you won't be able to.
You know he's a poor idiot and you shouldn't miss him.
But you do miss him,
and that makes you feel like a poor idiot.
And, damn it, your friends told you it was a matter of time.
So why the hell does it hurt as if it happened yesterday?
Oh, shit!
How was your Tinder date?
-Tostadapp. -What's that?
It's a long story. Too long.
-Know who's getting married? -Who? Besides everyone on my Facebook...
What an ugly envelope. Let me see.
Oh, Laura Rivas. It was obvious.
-Are you okay with this news? -I'm fine. Why should this get to me?
-You've always been jealous of her. -Don't exaggerate.
You cried in a bathroom for three hours when they gave her the graduation speech instead of you.
We were just kids. I'm fine now.
While she's picking out tablecloths and changing diapers,
I'll be picking investment funds and negotiating with China.
It's obvious who made better use of the last five years in economics.
Someone has to practice their radical forgiveness.
-I don't get it. -Me neither.
-There's one for you, too. -Let me see.
María Fe and Matías. Oh, it's just a small detail. You're going, right?
Oh, it's just a small detail. You're going, right?
I'll go. It's against my religion to pass up a table of chocolate.
-I'm proud of you! Amen to that. -Hallelujah.
Your life is a wardrobe.
And it doesn't matter how badly you want to buy clothes.
If you don't get rid of your old, ugly clothes
that drain your energy, you'll never have space for the new ones.
Get out of there! Go home!
I'm not exactly sure how to finish it, but I think this is the right direction.
Simplicity will help to tell the story.
I don't want to discourage you, but... I feel that your idea lacks emotion.
I don't want to discourage you, but... I feel that your idea lacks emotion. It's missing that boom. Do you understand?
-Of course. -Think bigger.
I understand, it could be more... attention-grabbing.
But because it's such a personal subject, Ramiro, I think that less is more.
But because it's such a personal subject, Ramiro, I think that less is more. In advertising, there's no such thing.
-"Less is more" doesn't exist. -It doesn't exist.
Don't repeat everything I say, Mini-Me.
Less is more doesn't exist in advertising. I'm going to tell you a story.
It was the year 1998, I had just returned from studying in Buenos Aires.
They offered me the launch of Virú Paints in all of Peru.
Seven supermodels, the biggest at that time.
Beautiful girls, all painted in colors...
San Martín Square... Lights...
Virú.
It was shown everywhere.
So you need me to use blonde models, wearing high heels...
Not models, I want something powerful.
Do you understand?
Anyone want to add anything?
That's what I get for showing something with sensitivity to my idiot, caveman, creep of a boss.
to my idiot, caveman, creep of a boss.
I hate him with all my heart. I hate men...
I hate him with all my heart. I hate men... No, you're not allowed to kill yourself in my office.
I wasn't going to kill myself. It's just a joke.
Hey, at least you don't hate me.
-Because we haven't had sex. -Good for us.
By the way, there's a party with everyone from the office.
By the way, there's a party with everyone from the office. Maybe it could give you ideas for "Soltera Codiciada"?
Let's go. You can invite your friend.
-Which friend? -Your only friend.
Very funny. Fine, I'll tell Natalia.
But she'll ignore you. You're not her type. You'll never be her type.
Hey, I'm the universal type, just so you know.
-He said we should wait by the bar. -Where? -Was that a good entrance? -On fire.
-Really? -There he is. -I saw him. -What a nice guy.
-I saw him. -What a nice guy. -Two cosmopolitans for the ladies. -Thank you.
So, since we're women, we should like Barbie drinks.
I like this drink. Do you want something else?
I like this drink. Do you want something else? -What are you having? -Whiskey.
I want the same.
I'm fine, thanks.
-What's wrong? -What? -You love girly drinks. -Let me have some fun.
-You love girly drinks. -Let me have some fun.
I don't get why you're so mean to him. He's the nicest heterosexual man I know.
I'm not being mean. This is how we treat each other. I don't know, we like it.
Hey, isn't that Carolina?
Hey, isn't that Carolina? -Where? -Over there.
-How are you? -Hey! I'm great.
-How long have you worked here? -I just started. Check this out.
Santiago is calling us. Come on, let's go. -Be back soon. -Okay.
Wait. That guy is looking at you.
Wait. That guy is looking at you. -He is? -Yes. -He's not. -He's still looking.
-He's not. -He's still looking. -What should I do? -Keep walking.
-What should I do? -Keep walking.
She's got a fan.
Come on, get over there.
No, I don't know how to flirt anymore. I'm serious, I don't remember how to.
No, I don't know how to flirt anymore. I'm serious, I don't remember how to. Why don't you try the lonely technique?
What is that? Oh, come on. It's when a woman is alone on purpose,
Oh, come on. It's when a woman is alone on purpose, and she makes this face like she'd love to talk.
-And what comes next? -Yeah.
You kiss him! Men like that.
You kiss him! Men like that. If the conversation doesn't flow, you kiss him, and that's it.
If the conversation doesn't flow, you kiss him, and that's it.
You can't talk if you're using your tongue.
Oh, don't be a caveman.
You should use the trick where you ask to try his drink.
You should use the trick where you ask to try his drink. You go towards him, and say, "Can I try your drink?"
You go towards him, and say, "Can I try your drink?"
But instead of grabbing the drink, you kiss him and say, "It's delicious."
I'll do both.
-Okay. -Go. -It'll work. -I'm going.
-It'll work. -I'm going. -You can do this. -Let's go.
What happened? They left.
Do you think it'll work?
I know him. He's my friend. I told him to go over.
Nice one!
Hopefully she'll stop talking about Matías for a while.
-Hi. -Hi. How are you?
Good, and you?
-I'm all right. -Just all right? Because you look great.
Thanks.
My friends just left me here. I mean...
-Isn't it better this way? -It is, right?
-Isn't it better this way? -It is, right? Of course.
-Yeah, but my drink is... gross. -Do you want me to buy you a drink?
No, I meant to ask... Can I try your drink?
Yes, of course.
-Cheers to our friend! -Cheers to her.
Good for you, María Fe.
Can I try your drink?
No.
It's delicious.
-You mean the kiss? -Both.
But you haven't tried the drink. Try it.
-Well, this is my house. The kitchen's-- -Nice place.
Wait a second.
-Upstairs. -Hurry up.
Holy Christ! Oh, God!
INCOMING CALL LOVEBUG
Hello.
Hello? Fe?
Matías?
-How are you? -Um...
I'm fine. Well, I was sleeping,
but now I'm wondering why you called me.
Listen... I was thinking about you.
And I just called to see how you're doing.
When your ex... Yes, your ex... With e for egotistical, for evasive...
With e for egotistical, for evasive...
for small dick... Okay, that doesn't start with e, but good point.
...calls you in the middle of the night to tell you that he misses you,
such a crappy gesture deserves only one response.
Look, I have good news and bad news.
The good news is that I know what I want.
And the bad news is that sure as hell isn't you.
So if you feel like chatting, call your psychologist, your 16 booty calls,
or your mother, because I'm not available, buddy.
As the saying goes,
"I sold my sack, so I didn't have to carry it."
Unfortunately, it's always harder to do it than to say it.
Fe? Are you not going to say anything?
I don't know what to tell you. Things are the way they are because of you.
Things are the way they are because of you.
What do you want? What's going on? I know. But something funny happened to me today,
I know. But something funny happened to me today, and I wanted to tell you,
but I realized we don't talk anymore. I don't like things to be this way.
but I realized we don't talk anymore. I don't like things to be this way. You were my best friend.
And you were mine.
Come on, stupid woman. Hang up. Come on, you can do it. Hang up!
And...
What happened to make you want to call me?
Brain-dead.
REST UP, BEAUTIFUL. I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW. TALK TO YOU TOMORROW
HI, LOVEBUG!
IT WAS GREAT TO TALK LAST NIGHT
-Hey! -Hey!
I have to go. I have a work meeting, but I can't find my sock.
Oh, it's somewhere here. They always hide around here.
-Here it is. Here you go. -Thank you.
Were you cooking breakfast?
-I had a great time. Your house is nice. -Thank you. It is, yeah.
-Thank you for everything. Bye. -No, thank you. Bye.
-Have a good day. I'll call you. -Sure, we'll talk.
-Have a good day. I'll call you. -Sure, we'll talk. Bye, you beast.
You, Mafe, are a cool girl. You are chill.
That's what you are. A cool, chill girl. People have told you that you are.
And you know you are, deep down.
If he calls you, fine. And if he doesn't, it's fine, too.
Chill. Cool.
That's how life goes. There's an eight-hour difference.
No need to get all worked up.
You do you. You--
INCOMING CALL UNKNOWN CALLER Shit!
Hello, lovebug.
Hi, is this María Fe?
Yes. Who's calling?
Jaime Castro, editor at Patrimonio magazine.
Santiago gave me your number. I'd like to interview you.
-Me? -Yes. You run the "Soltera Codiciada" blog, right?
Yes, it was supposed to be anonymous. I'm going to kill Santiago.
It's okay, I'm not going to reveal your identity.
I wanted to ask you some questions. INCOMING CALL LOVEBUG
Sorry, I'm not interested right now. Maybe another time.
Sorry, I'm not interested right now. Maybe another time. But--
Hi, lovebug.
Fe? Hi. I called you, but you didn't answer.
But it's for the best. I'm sorry I called you yesterday.
But it's for the best. I'm sorry I called you yesterday. I shouldn't have. It was a mistake.
You were right, we shouldn't let things get messy again.
It won't happen again. Bye, have a good one.
That guy better have kidnapped you. That has to be why you're not answering.
Yeah.
I need to know if you're okay and if you'll have the tissue presentation ready for next week.
An insistent guy, huh?
Holy shit! Not you again, please!
So, you watch series where men are to blame for everything.
You are to blame for everything.
-You've become one of those girls. -What kind of girl?
-You've become one of those girls. -What kind of girl? Tell me, what kind of girl am I?
-The type that says all men are the same. -Not all men are the same.
-The type that says all men are the same. -Not all men are the same. But you, and specifically you, you're a pain in the ovaries.
But you, and specifically you, you're a pain in the ovaries. What did I do?
You, with your fucking strategy of trying to keep me close enough so that you don't miss me,
but far enough so that I don't interfere in your new life.
What strategy, María Fe? Don't you see it's all in your head?
What about my plans, Matías?
I could be traveling around the world right now.
Or writing a book, or having babies. How could you have babies? Your cactuses die.
But I'm here, stuck and feeling miserable
But I'm here, stuck and feeling miserable because the person that I tried to make happy for six years
because the person that I tried to make happy for six years keeps putting me in second place, over and over again.
You are where you want to be.
Mafe?
I'm leaving.
Could you buy me a banana cupcake, please?
Or a... No, a banana cupcake. A cupcake.
The six months will be up in a week. The contract will end. -Here are the keys. Thank you. -What? No. What?
-Here are the keys. Thank you. -What? No. What?
Lucy and Pollock are on the balcony.
Okay? Water them just twice a week, or they'll drown.
And they're very sensitive, so talk or sing to them, or something.
You said you'd renew it for six more months.
Right, but not anymore. Why not?
-I'm going on a trip. -Where to?
To a country.
-To which country? -A country.
Which one?
It doesn't matter. I have this. I can sleep anywhere. I'm fine.
What?
You do realize what you're doing, right?
-What? -You're repeating.
The pattern.
-What pattern? -The bad pattern.
No.
Where you do the same thing over and over again.
So, you're in a place, and then you get antsy and want to leave?
Why? What's the problem? What's going on?
I don't like getting too comfortable in a place.
So I get bored and have to leave and go somewhere else.
I can make you feel more uncomfortable if you'd like.
I can be dirty.
I'll stop showering for weeks. I have before.
It's cool. I mean it.
Want me to clog the shower drain with my hair? It's not necessary.
What's so bad about staying here?
You're not going anywhere. Are you crazy?
No. This is your house. Look at everything you've done. Look at how beautiful, organized, and clean it is.
Look at how beautiful, organized, and clean it is.
You taught me to take care of the plants, to paint, and all of that.
It's our house.
And you're my sister now.
And I love you, and all of that.
I also... love you.
-Well, you're screwed, then. -No, you're screwed.
-Don't run away, coward. -I'm not. -My suitcase is over there. -What's that?
-My suitcase is over there. -What's that? It's nothing. It's a towel.
I'm going to the store. Didn't you want a cupcake? -Yes. -Okay, then.
But we need to talk about this, Carolina. I'm just saying, okay?
These repetitive patterns concern me.
-No. We're going to talk. -Come on. -We have to eat first. -Okay.
The last question, and I'll leave you alone, María Fe.
Why the name "Soltera Codiciada"?
Well, because "Almost 30 and Having an Existential Crisis" was already taken.
Don't spit it out.
I'm going to turn this off. I'm not recording anymore.
Thank you so much.
It was a nice interview. I had a great time.
-Thank you. -I have valuable information.
Don't worry, your name is my best kept secret.
That's very important.
Thank you. These have been the best 30 minutes of fame that I've ever had. My only minutes of fame.
The only ones? Come on, you'll be famous for a while. Your blog will be a big hit, I'm serious.
Your blog will be a big hit, I'm serious.
The women in my office get together on Monday mornings. -It's like a gossiping ritual. -What?
-They read your blog together. -Really? That's awesome.
Yes, and I must admit that I take a peek and read it with them.
I'll keep your secret if you keep mine.
-Yes, please. -Cheers.
Listen, would it be too... unprofessional if we continued this somewhere else?
Listen, would it be too... unprofessional if we continued this somewhere else? Maybe take a walk and get coffee or something?
A little bit, yes. But I told my boss that I have a doctor's appointment.
So who am I to judge? Right?
-Okay, great. -Okay. We're on the same page, then.
-Sure. -Should I ask for the check so we can go?
-Yes. -Is that okay? Great. Thank you.
As the saying goes, "When one door closes, another one opens."
And now some advice for me.
Look, a year and a half ago, I broke up with my ex...
Cool. And I still can't get her off my mind. I don't know what to do.
I'll pass.
Tell me, you're the single blogger.
Well, sometimes, behind that open door, an ex is hiding.
Well, the first thing I did was delete her from my phone.
-Bye, contact info. -Bye, WhatsApp. Bye, WhatsApp, photos, and audio messages.
-Then I unfriended her on Facebook. Bye. -Bye-bye.
What I can't do is stop following her on Instagram.
Instagraham! Norton Bell, man!
And she insists on posting every day. Every day she has a photo of whatever.
Well, you can't get over her overnight.
One day at a time.
Like the day when the smallest thing makes you feel empty inside.
Or the day when somebody asks you about that person,
and you don't know what to say.
Or the day when your head betrays you with old habits.
But there are also days when you surprise yourself by doing new things.
And days when you can laugh at yourself.
So each tear is one more step forward.
Each day is a day closer to you being well.
Live it, one tissue at a time.
This is a draft, so it can change. We can always improve it, right?
This is a draft, so it can change. We can always improve it, right? But why would we change it? I think it's good.
But why would we change it? I think it's good.
There's a connection, it makes the brand relevant.
I think it's in tune with what I want to communicate.
But we can do it. We could-- No, leave it like this.
I'm really very pleased. I think you've done a great job.
Congratulations. I knew you'd like it. She's the best.
That's great. Let me show you the ideas I have for outdoor ads and social media.
It's great.
Cut that long hair.
Kill those dreads.
And wash that hair.
The clients loved the campaign.
Really? That's a success because they're a part of a gigantic corporation.
What we have to do is win their brands one at a time.
-Okay. -What they want...
is for you to head all of their jobs.
Really?
So given the huge workload that's coming,
what you deserve...
is a promotion.
-A promotion? -Yes.
Really?
-Congratulations. -Thank you. Thanks.
I have to talk it over with my associate, but my decisions are always final.
I have to talk it over with my associate, but my decisions are always final. You're in.
That's great. Thank you so much.
Well, let's get to work!
Don't distract the genius.
Congratulations. Thank you.
-Caro? -Hey there.
Caro, you won't believe the day I had!
The presentation was amazing. You should've seen Ramiro's face. I should've posted it on FB, I'm serious.
We have a problem.
What's wrong?
So you don't have a dress for the wedding? I'll lend you one.
There's a full moon today, people get weird.
I just had some bacon.
I called the girls from school to see if we'd get her a present between all of us.
They told me there's no wedding list, because after the wedding, they're moving to New York. Okay.
They're moving to New York City.
She got the grant that I've been denied three times.
-And? -She has everything.
The perfect body, the perfect face, the perfect boyfriend. The perfect job.
I...
I thought it was necessary to sacrifice something.
I thought you had to focus on only one thing to...
-I feel so stupid. -Okay.
Honey.
Listen to me, honey. Listen.
To start, you're an incredible woman.
You are so successful. -But... -Yes, there's a but.
-But... -Yes, there's a but.
Maybe it's time for you to stop focusing only on work,
Maybe it's time for you to stop focusing only on work, and start thinking about yourself.
Maybe it's time for you to relax a bit.
Listen to me, you're 29 years old. You're not 89 years old.
You have all the time in the world to do things differently if you feel like it.
-I love you. -I love you, too.
Everything will be fine.
Can I keep saying that I'm a feminist, if I cried over Laura getting married?
No, hand me your gun, your badge, and your vibrator, please.
-No, not my vibrator. -Okay, let's toast.
-What are we celebrating? -She got a promotion.
-What? -Yes!
That's great. Well, let's celebrate. -Let's celebrate. -With our favorite drink.
-Let's celebrate. -With our favorite drink. I'm going to celebrate for real.
-Everyone can get married. -Who cares?
I got married to a tree once. Yes, it was a very beautiful ceremony.
But then they cut him down. Cheers anyway.
Here's to the tree moving on to a better life.
To paper and notebooks!
Hello. Hi, how are you?
Girlfriend... Don't be offended, but it's a great idea to come to a wedding without a date.
Don't be offended, but it's a great idea to come to a wedding without a date. -Why is that? -The suit effect.
-Why is that? -The suit effect.
All men look better in a suit.
The ugly ones become okay, the okay ones become hot,
and the hot ones become "let's go have sex now."
The Powerpuff Girls have arrived. Yay!
Yay! And you're Blossom.
-Blossom was the redhead. -Yes.
She should be Blossom. You're the redhead. And you'd be Bubbles.
She should be Blossom. You're the redhead. And you'd be Bubbles. -I'd be the green one. -You all look beautiful.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
I'll never understand how you get invited to all the events in Lima.
-I'm the life of the party. You know that. -We know it.
-I'm the life of the party. You know that. -We know it. There is Laurita!
-She looks strange. -She's too tall.
-It's too... -It doesn't look good.
What's that about? -Ouch. -I'm sorry.
-Ouch. -I'm sorry. Listen, tell me if it's my imagination, or if the guy over there is Matías.
Listen, tell me if it's my imagination, or if the guy over there is Matías.
Don't turn around. Don't look worried.
On the count of three, we'll laugh naturally at something.
Then turn around and tell me if it's him.
-Okay? -Yes.
One, two, three.
Shit, it's really him. -Really? -Yes.
Fe...
If dogs attack when they smell fear, exes come back when they sense calm.
-Don't start crying or get depressed. -Don't leave the party just to avoid him.
-Don't start crying or get depressed. -Don't leave the party just to avoid him. But above all, don't hook up with him.
Everything will be fine. Take it easy.
There is a survival plan for this.
-First, no alcohol. -No alcohol.
To survive this situation, there are three basic rules.
One, don't drink alcohol because it makes you weaker.
Two, talk to the most attractive guy there.
That's great. -Here he is. -Hey.
-How are you? -Good, very good. -Javi, this is... -Mafe.
-Mafe. -How are you? -This is my boyfriend, Javi. -Great, nice to meet you.
-This is my boyfriend, Javi. -Great, nice to meet you.
Three, act indifferent when you run into him.
If none of that works, you can dive into the chocolate table.
Hey.
If I don't come over, you won't congratulate us? Laurita, forgive me.
-Congratulations. -Thank you.
-Everything's beautiful. Congratulations. -Thank you.
Do you remember Natalia?
-No. -Oh, come on.
She's my childhood friend from school.
You never mentioned her.
Oh, please. We've known each other for ages. She's so funny.
She's so funny. Listen, she is Cupid's number one mortal enemy.
Listen, she is Cupid's number one mortal enemy.
You can't imagine. They hate each other. Can't stand the sight of each other. She's like Pennywise the Clown. Terrified of love. Always alone.
She's like Pennywise the Clown. Terrified of love. Always alone. -I wouldn't say that. -It's true.
Did you bring a date today? -Yes. -Oh, come on.
-Yes. -Oh, come on. -Come on, Natalia. -I'm serious, I brought a date.
-Really? -Yes. -Where is the poor guy? -The bathroom. I'll introduce you later.
-Where is the poor guy? -The bathroom. I'll introduce you later. -My love. -There he is.
There he is.
Here he is. This is my boyfriend, Santiago.
Here he is. This is my boyfriend, Santiago. -Hi, Santiago. -How are you?
I'm great. Congratulations.
Well, we have to move on.
-Enjoy. -You, too. -Let's go. -Congratulations.
-Let's go. -Congratulations.
That was good, right? It wasn't too much, right? Or was it?
Some chocolates for later?
Are you sure I can leave you here by yourself? Will you be okay?
Yes, I'll be fine. -Okay. -It's fine.
I'm going to leave soon. My feet really hurt. Okay.
Why are you speaking with a Spanish accent?
It's because I met this amazing guy. He's so handsome, he makes me horny.
So he asked me if I speak Spanish. I said yes, but with a Spanish accent.
Now I have to keep the act up, or else he'll think that I'm a fake.
And actually, I am. But he doesn't know that.
I feel possessed.
Infatuated.
You still wear those heels that hurt your feet?
You should throw them away, it's silly. I'm not silly.
What do you want? Can I stay here for a bit?
You're already here. What's going on?
I've been meaning to talk to you.
I don't have any missed calls from you, Matías.
I'd have one if you wanted to talk to me. I don't want to talk.
Just let me tell you what I wanted to say. I'll say it, and I'll leave you alone.
I wanted to apologize for being an idiot.
I miss you a lot. I've thought a lot about you.
It's been so hard for me to be over there by myself.
Getting used to everything...
I had to stop myself from texting and calling you.
-You're drunk, right? -No.
I'm telling you how I really feel. Who else would I tell?
It hasn't been easy for me.
There were times when I thought, what am I doing here?
What am I doing with my life?
I was confused.
I screwed up, Fe.
I didn't want to fuck things up. I'm really sorry.
You don't have to apologize to me, it's not necessary.
Just stop dragging me into your problems. If you're confused...
You have no right to come here and mess with my head.
You have no right to come here and mess with my head. I messed up, I know that.
I want to apologize for that.
I've been thinking a lot.
I read your blog.
I think it's great.
I'm glad you're writing. It was what you wanted, right?
I arrived in Lima, and I wanted to go see you.
I wanted to know how you're doing, meet up.
Why are you telling me all this?
Because it's the truth.
Okay.
Do you still pay attention to signs?
Today, the moon lines up with Mars, and...
and your aura is, like, orange or red.
Do you realize that what you're saying makes no sense?
One song?
I came to this wedding just because of you.
I missed you a lot, Fe.
No.
No, I'm sorry.
-Fe. -What? -What's wrong? -What do you mean?
Do you not love me anymore?
I have too much alcohol in my blood to have this talk.
-I can't now. -I need an answer.
What do you want to know? Matías, we'll talk tomorrow, okay?
What do you want to know? Matías, we'll talk tomorrow, okay? -It'll be better. -No, I need to know.
Fe...
I'm here.
For you.
It was hot and there was fire between us and all of that, but we're not husband and wife.
So he left. He took the bus and left.
I don't get why you talk like a Spaniard to them. Come on, it's hot. Don't accents turn you on?
Come on, it's hot. Don't accents turn you on?
-I don't know. -It's romantic. Imagine the rose petals and the stud.
Imagine the rose petals and the stud.
Oh, come on! You've never had sex in a different language?
-In Chinese once. -Oh, no. -What? Chinese can be very sensual. -Good morning.
-What? Chinese can be very sensual. -Good morning. -Hey. -Sleeping Beauty woke up.
-Hey. -Sleeping Beauty woke up. What are you doing here?
-So much love, good morning to you, too. -Good morning.
You left yesterday without saying anything. I was worried.
-You forgot your purse. -Oh, thank you.
I'll put it away now.
-How delicious. -Thank you.
-Hi, good morning. -Hi.
-Hi, good morning. -Hi. -Hi, Natalia. -Good morning.
My roommate Carolina. This is Matías. -Hi. -Hi, I'm Caro.
-Hi. -Hi, I'm Caro. -I'm Matías. -How are you?
-I'm Matías. -How are you?
-Fine. -Do you want to eat anything? Carolina is a great cook.
She makes some things like... -What did you make? -Oatmeal and yogurt.
-What did you make? -Oatmeal and yogurt. -How delicious. -And chia seeds and stuff.
-How delicious. -And chia seeds and stuff. -She makes it from scratch. -It has no sugar.
-Do you like it? -It's good.
Why don't we ask tomorrow? Maybe he'll change his mind.
-Natalia... -What? Shut up.
-You live in Madrid, right? -Yes.
How is it?
-It's beautiful. -What about the Spanish women?
Enough. I prefer the Peruvian women.
-I'll head out now. -I'm sorry.
I'll talk to my aunt today about the tickets. Okay, we'll talk later.
Nice to meet you, Caro. -Bye. -Take care.
-Bye. -Bye.
So, you're going to Madrid.
Just to make things clear, this is the news:
Just to make things clear, this is the news: Matías has asked me to go live with him in Madrid.
But I told him I need to think about it. Okay? Are we good?
Okay? Are we good?
We're good, thanks. Will you continue with the blog? You were really happy about that, right?
Will you continue with the blog? You were really happy about that, right?
Of course, I'll continue writing my blog.
I'm not going to move to a cave in the forest.
Are you sure? You didn't write one word during your six years with him.
I remember. I don't know if you do, -but I remember. -What is it?
I'm telling you the truth. When he's here, everything revolves around him.
You disappear. That's not a healthy relationship.
What do you know about relationships?
Based on your vast experience with love, what do you know?
Girls, why don't we have breakfast, and then...
-Shut up, Carolina! -You're right.
Maybe I don't know about relationships.
But I do know you. This is not a good idea, and you know it.
How is it not a good idea? Natalia, you've seen me without him.
How is it not a good idea? Natalia, you've seen me without him. -How did I feel? Like shit. -Yes.
-How did I feel? Like shit. -Yes.
I felt like shit.
Now he shows up, he regrets what he did, he apologizes, he asks me to move to Madrid with him.
he apologizes, he asks me to move to Madrid with him.
I'm happy with him. What's the problem?
You can't be happy if you only focus on making him happy.
I don't get it. Please explain it to me.
Tell me, how can you be happy like that?
-You're so dense, so insensitive. -You can't handle hearing the truth.
-You're so dense, so insensitive. -You can't handle hearing the truth. -No! -Yes, look at yourself.
-No! -Yes, look at yourself.
I'm like this because you can't stand that I'm happy.

SOLTERA, DON'T LEAVE US!
WE NEED YOU
2018 CALENDAR ANTI-PRINCESSES AND ANTIHEROES
Hey, you should've told me the elevator wasn't working. I had to go up hundreds of steps.
When I came up, it was working.
Like this shitty camera that stopped working.
-What's wrong with it? -Something with the lens.
Everything looks beautiful.
-I spoke with my aunt. -Did you?
She'll book your flight for the last week in July.
After you resign, you'll need a month or two to prepare for the move.
That sounds about right.
I have a colleague there who works in advertising.
He's really great, and I told him about you.
He'll let you know if he has any projects. Cool, right?
Cool.
It looks like you've done many things without me.
That's enough with the camera.
I want a nice photo before we leave.
Okay, I'll let go of the camera.
We're going to relax and have some wine.
Great.
Will you pass me the wine opener?
-Oh, shoot. -What?
I forgot it.
-I'll go get it now. -No, no, don't worry.
What? Listen.
What is it?
Only in Lima can an alarm go off at this hour and go all night.
In Spain, they fine you. This idiot's probably so far away
that he can't hear the alarm.
Well, it'll turn off soon enough.
We should just leave.
I'm tired of living here.
I like Lima.
-Really? -Yes.
Of course.
I like my neighborhood.
I like my house.
Walking around, going to the market, I don't know, stuff like that...
See? It turned off.
Matías. I think...
I think that I want to stay here.
I don't think I want to go to Madrid.
You're joking, right?
I told you I was going to think about it.
It was an obvious yes.
Not really.
You wanted to move eight months ago. What happened?
We haven't spoken in eight months. Everything has changed.
We haven't spoken in eight months. Everything has changed. No, things are the same. It's you and me.
No.
No, it's not the same.
It's like...
To be with you, I have to be where you are.
Would you drop your master's degree to be with me?
-It's not the same thing. -Yes, it's the same.
Matías, when you decided to be without me
I thought I'd die from the pain. I mean it.
Now you show up with this proposal, and I...
I'm scared to death.
Because...
Because by being without you,
I've found myself.
On my own.
Just recently.
I don't understand you.
You don't want to travel?
So that's it?
I think so.
Really? Just like that?
Really? Just like that? Not just like that.
Not just like that.
And you know that.
Now what?
Well, now...
SLACKER
-The darker one. -The darker one?
Yes, with the gray scale.
No, the darker one...
-Ramiro. -Hey, genius!
I was about to ask you to sign the contract.
I quit.
Excuse me?
I am truly thankful for the opportunity.
But there is something I need to do right now.
I want-- I'm going to write a book.
You'll write a book.
You want to write a book here in Peru, where nobody reads.
Yes.
Has anyone read a book in the past month?
So everyone reads books now. So we're all readers now.
Okay, is this a move to ask for more money?
Okay, is this a move to ask for more money? -Or what? -No, not at all.
-Or what? -No, not at all.
I just need to do this now. I can't put it off any longer.
Don't worry about the tissues. I'll leave everything ready for you.
-I'll take care of it. -Don't worry.
Really, don't worry about it.
If you want to leave now, go ahead. No problem, I won't go after you.
-Okay, thanks. -But let me give you some advice.
Maybe the offer and the contract
made you think you can play in the big leagues.
But don't fool yourself, really.
I'm being honest here. You're not a good writer.
You need a lot more to be a good writer.
Don't risk what you have.
I'm serious. You could lose it all.
I'm serious. You could lose it all. I know.
I know.
And maybe you're right.
Maybe I still have a lot to learn. And maybe nobody will read what I write.
But I would rather do that, even if I make a ton of mistakes,
than continue working for a misogynist,
sexist, racist, and homophobic man like you.
I don't know if I impressed you, or if I needed more...
Take that, dumbass!
Stop talking with an Argentinian accent! You're not from Argentina.
You spent four months in Argentina!
Why are you here?
-María Fe... -What?
I'm fixing the pipes.
Oh, so that's what they call it now! Fixing the pipes.
Look at you.
-Hi. -Hi.
-I can't take this anymore... -I'm sorry... -I feel so sad... -I'm serious...
-I feel so sad... -I'm serious... -I overstepped... -No, you didn't.
-I overstepped... -No, you didn't. -I have to face that... -No, I was wrong...
-I have to face that... -No, I was wrong... I broke up with Matías.
-What did you say? -She broke up with Matías.
Are you okay?
Yes.
And I want to make my blog into a book.
-Really? -Yes.
-It's going to be a hit. -Yes!
You're already a hit.
-Let's never fight again. -Never. -It was horrible. -It was horrible.
-It was horrible. -It was horrible. -I had stomach pains. -I couldn't sleep.
Will you tell me what's going on? -Where? -So is he really...
-Where? -So is he really... Is he really fixing the pipes?
-Or is it a joke? -It's true.
He's fixing other things, too.
Is he fixing other things?
What else is he fixing? You're being affectionate!
You're being affectionate! Did you just call her baby? Are you all sweet now?
Did you just call her baby? Are you all sweet now? -I don't know. -Like a little girl?
-I don't know. -Are you little Natalia? -She's blushing. -She is blushing!
-She's blushing. -She is blushing!
PATIENCE
And then that day arrives.
There's no way to predict the exact dates and no formulas that take you there.
-Friends... -What's up?
-I think I finished. -What?
The book.
-What? -Yes!
-No way! -Oh, my goodness!
I was referring to the structure. I still have to write the book.
-Well, cheers. -Yes, cheers!
-Cheers! -Cheers.
Cheers to you!
-Let's take a look. -Want to? So, I want to make fun of fairy tales. So each color represents a chapter.
So, I want to make fun of fairy tales. So each color represents a chapter.
You'll have this strange feeling of peace.
And you'll smile thinking,
"Good for you, slacker! It was about time!"
We've been taught that we're the princess in the fairy tale.
But we can also be the fairy godmother if a friend needs our help.
Or the genie in the lamp when we try to meet everyone's expectations at once.
Good? Cool? [sniffles]
Electronica isn't just music for me.
That beat is like my heart sound.
[DJ Fingablast] And I became a DJ because of one man:
‎DJ Slizzard.
‎And this is his story.
‎But mostly... it's my story.
[announcer] Brisbane, give it up for DJ Fingablast
and a hologram of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.!
[Dr. King hologram] I have a-- -[electronic music playing] -♪ Beat, beat ♪
♪ Beat, beat, beat... ♪ [DJ Fingablast] I was on top of the world.
I had mo' money and fewer problems, yo.
And I had something almost as important as money.
-[music winds down] -Love.
-[mellow music playing] -That smokestack right there is my girl,
Hello Hadid, the third Hadid sister.
[Hello] Hey, guys, how amazing are pennies?
[DJ Fingablast] Her eyes are the sexiest 'cause she's super allergic to her mascara.
We met having sex at a vodka launch party.
True love, brah!
I knew I had to lock that ish down.
[whispering] Oh, man. I'm so nervous, but pumped.
She's gonna love this. Shh.
Hey, Lo. I'm not good at talking about my feelings
Hey, Lo. I'm not good at talking about my feelings 'cause of my childhood,
so I let my music speak for me.
So what do you say, babe?
Will you marry me?
No homo?
M'kay.
Yes!
Yes!
Boom!
But who was gonna DJ my wedding?
Who could DJ my wedding?
‎[Richard] ‎We gotta get this party going, ‎if you don't mind.
We got the follow-up hit to the Baha Men's "Who Let the Dogs Out?"
That's right, it's... "When Let The Dogs Out?"
"When Let The Dogs Out?" [man] ♪ When let the dogs out? ♪
[man] ♪ When let the dogs out? ♪ -[men] ♪ When, when, when? ♪ -That's right.
-[men] ♪ When, when, when? ♪ -That's right. -[man] ♪ When let the dogs out? ♪ -[men] ♪ When, when, when? ♪
-[men] ♪ When, when... ♪ -This guy's the king!
[Richard] Hey, uh, bartender?
[Richard] Hey, uh, bartender? Think the DJ could get another one of these juice boxes, please? That'd be super.
Sure, baby. What do you wa-- Oh, man. You're a boy. You sound just like a chick.
You're a boy. You sound just like a chick.
You know that's why they hire adult women to play boys in cartoons?
-[young Fingablast] Bart Simpson's a girl? -Yeah, he is.
-Well, you're gonna need a weird penis. -[young Fingablast] Okay!
yeah, sure. You know... uh...
don't do drugs... on an army base.
Stay in school... for, like, five years too long,
'cause then you're way bigger than all the teachers,
and then it's your school.
Get the limbo line to come to you, 'cause then you can see up stuff.
Know what I mean?
[DJ Fingablast] Who could DJ my wedding?
The answer was obvious:
DJ Slizzard.
Little did I know...
I didn't know what I was in for.
-[geese honking] -[moody string music playing]
[DJ Fingablast] DJ Slizzard was the only man on Earth who could spin at my wedding.
But where was he?
Hey, guys! DJ Slizzard is north Indiana's only DJ for all your party needs,
from sweet 16s to dirty 30s to nasty 90s!
Additionally, I am the proud possessor of The Guinness Book of World Records for highest FPM in Grundel County.
of The Guinness Book of World Records for highest FPM in Grundel County.
[DJ Fingablast] So I flew to Indiana
and set up a camera at the airport.
Then I flew back to New York and got on another plane to Indiana
so I could get this footage of my plane landing.
Here we go. This looks like it's it.
Whoa, whoa, bro, I'm not looking for trouble-- only treble and bass.
And the guy who used to live here.
Who? Dick Wayne?
[DJ Fingablast] Dick Wayne must be DJ Slizzard's real name,
which explains the D. But where did the J come from?
Boy, what are you staring at?
Do you know when Maestro Wayne'll be back?
[Bankston] Man, that dude is long gone.
So, legally, all of his hairbrushes are mine...
even if some of his relatives come around looking for them.
DJ Slizzard is dead? [Bankston] He's in prison.
Forever. Ever. Ever.
Ever.
[coughs] I'm sorry. Forgot to take my medication this morning.
Orning. Orning.
Orning.
[DJ Fingablast] DJ Sliz, in priz?
It didn't make any sense.
I mean, DJ Slizzard is the legend who brought the air horn to the Midwest.
[Richard laughs] That's right!
Get it up, get it up, get it up!
Just because you're pregnant doesn't mean you cannot dance. -Let's go. -[air horn blares]
There's only one thing I can think of.
His beats must have started a shorty fire on the dance floor.
Cause of death? Fire burns.
Beats that sick gotta be illegal.
You're under arrest.
It's the only explanation.
And yet, it also wasn't.
Well, the little stinker in tonight's Naughty Neighbors Nook
is Richard Wayne Gary Wayne.
The Durnsville resident and adjunct professor at Trump University
was apprehended earlier today after acting weird at a Walmart.
‎I need these tampons because I am a woman,
‎I need these tampons because I am a woman, ‎and I wanna swim with confidence.
‎[officer]‎ Okay, sir. ‎[Richard] ‎Karate!
‎Karate! Karate! Regular punch!
‎Just kidding. That was karate.
[officer] Care to explain this key we found at your house, Dick?
It's labeled "bunker," comma, "girls."
So? Girls are keys.
Everyone knows that.
'Cause they love rings, and they'll poke you in the scrotum
'Cause they love rings, and they'll poke you in the scrotum if you sit on 'em wrong. [snickers]
Everybody knows keys are boys! Locks are girls!
What's in the bunker, Dick?
[reporter] They look like women, but they stink like hogs.
Fifteen years in an underground bunker explains some of it.
[Kimmy and Cyndee] The world's still here! This is the bomb!
After all that time together,
we're pretty synced up.
Library. Melissa Joan Hart. Razzmatazz!
Ah, the "Macarena." Wonderful. -Remember when Dr. Evil did it? -Ay!
I think I should get out of the sun now.
I'll just be in the bunker.
[Kimmy] Do you have a mirror?
Oh. No, sorry, I asked for a mirror, not a picture of an old Irish witch.
Tabby Bobatti, you were the Reverend's live-in girlfriend,
but you didn't know what was happening?
Well, it's healthy to have secrets in a relationship.
to have secrets in a relationship.
He doesn't know about half the yarn I buy.
You were his fudging girlfriend?
Well, it's hard to find a tall guy.
[reporter] Richard Wayne Gary Wayne was sentenced today
[reporter] Richard Wayne Gary Wayne was sentenced today to three counts of white kidnapping
and one count of "oopsie, no bueno."
[DJ Fingablast] How could someone who created so much beauty be responsible for such butt ugliness?
How can I get married without a kick-ass DJ?
And also, was I skipping stones wrong?
To answer that question, I consulted champion stone skipper
Damar Varnish at his estate, Rockswater.
No.
You've gotta...
side-arm it.
Like that.
[DJ Fingablast] My other questions,
-only one man could... -[line rings]
...should, and would answer them.
[Richard] Richard Wayne. Who's this? Oh! This is him.
Uh, hello, sir. This is Douglas Fingerbur--
DJ Fingablast.
I wanna talk to you about why you're in prison.
[Richard] Hang on, this is a dude?
'Cause this whole prison deal is kind of a sausage fest.
Anyone who visits better be ready to put something I don't have on the glass.
to put something I don't have on the glass. Boobs, butt--
Wait, you don't have a butt?
[DJ Fingablast] My hero doesn't have a butt...
but I do.
And if I'm ever gonna meet him...
I gotta catfish DJ Slizzard.
So I made a fake Facebook profile that was sure to get his attention.
This is all for us, babe.
[DJ Fingablast] But then I learned something from a rerun of CSI: Miami
that I was unable to get the rights to.
He won't be liking any more pictures of corpses on Facebook.
Because prisoners aren't allowed to use Facebook.
[DJ Fingablast] I printed Karen's page and mailed it to DJ Slizzard.
For authenticity, I also included a pair of ladies' underwear
that I rubbed on a small dog.
You need to put something on the glass for me first:
answers.
Oh, man. Another catfish?
Shoot.
[DJ Fingablast] I worshipped you, man.
How could you do something so sick?
And not good sick, like sneakers you wait in line for.
Bad sick, like when they found E.T. in that stream.
What's going on with the camera?
Oh, I'm making a documentary.
-About me? -No, it's about me
-About me? -No, it's about me needing a DJ for my wedding.
[Richard] Stupid. Why would anybody wanna make a... a movie about ole Dicky Slizzard, right?
Only thing I've ever been good at is manipulating people.
[DJ Fingablast] Hey, don't say that. You were also a great DJ.
Yeah, I were.
I mean, it's hopeless for me.
For somebody to get my case reopened,
they'd have to be really smart,
have to have some money,
bunch of cameras.
They'd have to have a... a visitor's pass to this prison.
I mean... [scoffs] Good luck, Dick!
I'm out of here, man.
-Sliz, wait. -What?
Could I really get your case reopened?
Like, is that a real thing?
Adnan from Serial,
Staircase guy,
Dr. Richard Kimble...
they all had their cases reopened because of a supersmart documentary
that didn't leave anything out.
[DJ Fingablast] And that's when, all on my own,
I came up with a new idea for what my documentary should be about.
So I started looking into it.
And this whole thing... didn't make any sense.
[Donald Trump] Take a look. Look at her. You tell me what you think.
I don't think so. I don't think so.
Believe me, she would not be my first choice. That, I can tell you.
[DJ Fingablast] Look, DJ Slizzard is hot-- as hot as the hottest insectivore.
as hot as the hottest insectivore. Did the Mole Women match up?
Did the Mole Women match up?
It was horrible. [sobs]
And I missed, like, ten Olympics.
It was only nine, Miss Schmidt.
[Dunleavy] Now are you ready to be honest with us?
Hi, Donna Maria Nuñez?
I'm DJ Fingablast. I'm making a documentary.
-How old are you? -[Donna Maria] Huh?
Show us the birth cert!
[in Spanish] I didn't know that the monkeys who work in my factories -were underage. -No, how old are you?
-were underage. -No, how old are you?
[rapidly] BunCo Bunkers' five-year warranty is void in the state of purchase. 0% APR financing intended as a joke.
in the state of purchase. 0% APR financing intended as a joke.
Product not endorsed by the Peyton Manning who plays football.
[Richard] FYI, my fantasy bunker...
Copperfield-era Claudia Schiffer,
two Maria Menounoses,
and one of them pomegranate juice bottles.
DJ Slizzard, I'm starting to think...
-you didn't even do it. -[Richard] Hey, look,
-you didn't even do it. -[Richard] Hey, look, you're the documentary guy. I'm just a kidnapper. Just a... reverend.
you're the documentary guy. I'm just a kidnapper. Just a... reverend.
I-I'm just a...
I'm just an American DJ.
If you didn't do it, who did?
You know what? Why don't you ask yourself this:
who stood to benefit...
from this guy being locked up?
Like Hillary should've been.
Think about it.
I mean, I did have a rival.
DJ Traphouse.
[DJ Fingablast] Another DJ?
As one of our own, I couldn't believe
As one of our own, I couldn't believe that one of our own could do this to one of our own.
And with you out of the way-- Oh, to him fall the spoils
of my... Golden... Kingdom:
three p.m. slot at Slappy's Pizza;
signature banter, like, "Wake up, fatties, it's time to boogie";
and my antique buffalo-horn and boar-bristle hairbrush collection.
[DJ Fingablast] I finally had a lead.
You need to find DJ Traphouse.
[DJ Fingablast] I had to find DJ Traphouse and get him to confess.
Then Slizzard could J my wedding.
But no matter how much I drove around,
I couldn't find him or get him to confess.
So I gave up, did ayahuasca in a cemetery,
and it led me straight to Traphouse's current address.
[producer] Hey, he's here.
[DJ Fingablast] My hero is in jail, and the only person who could free him is dead.
And I still don't have a wedding DJ.
So I went back to the only place where I'd ever truly felt safe:
Rockswater.
-More sideways. -Okay.
That's it.
[DJ Fingablast] Then everything went -from bad... -[cell phone chimes] ...to, "Oh, no, you didn't."
[sighs] Sliz, there's no point.
I don't need a DJ for my wedding anymore.
She dumped me like a poop, bro.
She dumped me like a poop, bruh.
[DJ Fingablast] There was nothing left for me in Indiana,
so I took my airport camera and went back to New York.
Why? [sobs]
I don't wanna say good-bye to Hello.
-[electronic music playing] -I was lost.
There was no point continuing with the film. [man] ♪ Life's not always Miami ♪
-[switch clicks] -[DJ Fingablast] Then... -[cell phone chimes] -...everything changed.
Someone posted on Karen Sorrento's Facebook page. [cameraman] But that's a straight man,
And I said take your fleece off!
Let's go, boys!
Come on! Whoo!
I'm a beautiful man...
a man who now feels pretty good about himself thanks to you, Fran.
Another catfish.
Damn it. I knew you were too cool to be a female.
Cool like how?
Look at your profile, dude. You're a dream girl.
MAGA, ka-ra-tay, DJ Slizzard...
[stammers] ...girls in bikinis getting really hurt.
Wait, you're a Slizzard Lizard?
Are you kidding me?
He played my great-aunt's nasty 90th.
-[laughs] -And he went home with her... as a joke.
-[laughs] -God, it just kills me that he's still locked up.
Especially since I know he shouldn't even be in jail.
[DJ Fingablast] I don't believe in fate,
so it was probably magic elves who brought Fran and me together that night.
Hi. Um... I am Fran Dodd.
I am founder and C-F-Bro of The Innocence Broject,
an organization that fights back in the war on men.
I am telling you, man, men are under attack.
Do you know how many times I have been stabbed with keys?
Nineteen times, just for
walking closely to a woman's face.
This is where, uh, we keep a lot of, like, our--our case files here,
like, uh, Cosby. That's a big one.
Uh, Mr. Frumpus. Richard--Richard's file?
Yeah, it's in here.
This is all proof.
How about this right here?
How about this right here? Where is Dick Wayne being held right now?
Okay, well, let's just take a look right here...
'cause this is where Dick Wayne is being held.
Can you get close enough? Says it right here. Right here.
Men's Prison.
Not People's Prison.
Mee-en's Prison. Okay?
They knew when they built this place who they were gonna lock up.
It's absolutely disgusting.
Masculinity is being criminalized in this country, okay?
And I want something done did about it.
Because what you're accused of -shouldn't be a crime. -[Richard] Exactly.
-shouldn't be a crime. -[Richard] Exactly.
I mean, are we even talking about? Innocent and--and guilty?
Sorry, what I did was called "nature."
I mean, look at dolphins. They're huge rapists,
and ladies kiss them right on their holes over at SeaWorld.
Why isn't anybody getting a tattoo of me on their ankle?
Men are not the problem. Women are the problem.
Things were fine until we started letting them make their own decisions.
L-listen, y'all. Let me tell you about a--about a good friend of mine
about a--about a good friend of mine who's really handsome.
And he went... to LA, saved up all his money,
got a sweet-ass butt cut,
and did the ladies a favor... by going on a TV dating show.
[host] Richard, how are you gonna make her feel special?
Well... we'd start off with some fabulous food,
-a little fabulous conversation... -[laughter]
...end it with a fabulous foot massage,
for an evening of total fabulosity.
And she chose Marc!
I mean, what?
They got to go to the zoo together.
Why does she even get to choose at all?
Men should be doing the choosing!
Man. I thought women should do what they want, but if they couldn't,
I'd still be with Hello.
God, why'd she dump me?
Because women are stupid.
They don't even know how to make decisions good.
You should see my mommy try and order at a restaurant.
[DJ Fingablast] So that night, I did.
[woman] Southern rib platter. Yum!
-No, I'll never eat all that. -No.
But if you were gonna pick between the French dip...
-French dip. -...and the firehouse fajitas-- -French dip. -Oh, my God, what do they have?
-French dip. -Oh, my God, what do they have?
-[hand slams table] -God, it is dessert, Sheila! They are having dessert.
[Richard] It's dark days, brosephs.
They say, "You snooze, you lose."
Well, we snossed...
and look what we lost.
[DJ Fingablast] After talking to Fran and DJ Sliz, I read the news.
And it was news to me.
There really is a war going on.
I mean, who's next, the majestic anteater?
I also learned our infrastructure is a mess, yo!
our infrastructure is a mess, yo! [Richard] Here we are. Now it's "Person of the Year."
[Richard] Here we are. Now it's "Person of the Year."
They hijacked the Ocean's franchise.
Now there's a female Colonel Sanders? What's next, female chickens?
I don't even get it, y'all.
But if we don't take a stand now...
-we're herstory. -[Fran] Ugh.
They're gonna shestroy everything.
[Richard] I ain't down with that world.
I have an appointment for a penis removal, -here in the year... -[musical sting]
-...this year! [distorted echo] This year, this year, this year, this year, this year...
[DJ Fingablast] We have to fight back,
or pretty soon, every clip package will look like this.
A great man rots in jail right now because Lady Justice
is living up to her name.
That coldhearted skank is just ice.
Meanwhile, what are DJ Slizzard's supposed victims doing?
Cyndee Pokorny continues to profit from her tragedy.
She recently sang the national anthem at an NFL preseason game
between the Atlanta Vaccinators and the Chicago Interracial Marriages.
♪ And the home ♪
[DJ Fingablast] And as for Donna Maria?
She used wordplay to become a mole sauce
mole-ionnaire and...
a judge on Shark Tank Español.
[in Spanish] Marco Americano here is crazy.
What you've just described is a horse.
I'm out.
[DJ Fingablast] And Gretchen Chalker is the real cult leader.
She's now running her own church inside a women's prison!
What?
Now they're keeping us out of the prisons we built?
And in the future,
female doctors will remove the penises with saws.
-Yes! That's right! -[cheers and applause]
[DJ Fingablast] Then there's Kimmy Schmidt.
[DJ Fingablast] The woman who put Tabby Bobatti in intensive care...
ended up intensively caring about the Reverend.
-That's good writing. -[Kimmy grunting]
[DJ Fingablast] No wonder she was so mad at Tabby.
Kimmy is married to DJ Slizzard.
And she never gave up on bae.
[Kimmy] I'll never divorce you, Dick! Not even when pigs fly!
[DJ Fingablast] Maybe this documentary isn't about finding a DJ for my wedding.
It's just about the best DJ of all:
love.
[Richard] Have yo-o-o-ou...
spoken to Kimmy?
Oh, for the documentary?
Shoot, that's a good idea. [Richard] No, don't ever speak to her. I mean, because...
speak to her. I mean, because...
we value...
we value our privacy.
That's why I didn't say anything about it. You know? Even though
our marriage would obviously humanize me, audience-wise.
Wow. Kimmy stood by you, man. [chuckles]
#NotAllWomen.
[Richard] So I guess...
...if a good woman like Kimmy is on my side--and she is, but again, don't ask her--
is on my side--and she is, but again, don't ask her--
then maybe the whole word can get on board
with my fabulosity.
You gotta finish this movie, Finga.
Finish it up. Hey, win a Peabody, like Entourage.
Then who knows, man? Who knows?
Maybe my case gets reopened,
and maybe I finally get reunited
with my little pasty-faced, ketchup-headed...
...sweetie pateetie.
Kimmy. That's who I'm talking about. You know.
[DJ Fingablast] I did my part. You just watched it.
Still are.
So does Slizzard's story end here?
That's up to the people who believe in him.
People like Fran Dodd;
Fran's mom, who supports him no matter what;
Fran's buddy Frisco, who you didn't meet but is cool;
this guy we met who would literally do anything;
and, of course, -Kimmy Schmidt... -Well--
[DJ Fingablast] ...TabbyBobatti; this lady;
[DJ Fingablast] ...TabbyBobatti; this lady; -that dude... -What is this for?
[DJ Fingablast] Karen Sorrento; David Caruso;
Damar Varnish; DJ Traphouse;
DJ Trump;
and the most important person...
you, America.
Dude, they won't be able to see themselves.
We talked about this.
[DJ Fingablast] Put this part in slow motion!
Hurry up, this way!
Slow down, Cory.
We finally made it.
The smell of nature and friendship.
Truck.
Caboose!
Hey! Come back! I'm going to get you!
Hey, no flying!
Help! I'm gonna fall!
I'm okay.
This wall totally…
rocks!
Yay! Camp Friendship!
Wow, nothing's changed!
Hey, Carson. Welcome back.
Hey, Rory!
Hey, Cory.
-Carley. -It's so good to see you again.
Back to be happy my.
-What? -D'oh!
I'm happy you're back too, Cory. Come on, follow me.
Let's do a refresher tour.
Okay.
-First stop is our mess hall. -They've got corn dogs over there.
Oh, me and Freddie made bacon towers here last year.
Oh, no!
I guess that's why they call it the mess hall.
Good one, Carley.
This is where we had our end-of-camp bonfire last year.
Kimmy, Timmy, that's not for firewood.
Fine.
Cory, when you go on a hike,
make sure you stay on our special summer camp paths.
-What about that other path? -Oh, you can't go on that path.
What happens if you do?
Oh, well, you go to jail for that.
-What? -What?
Just kidding! But it's important you don't break the rules.
And finally, the most important rule of Camp Friendship
is to be a good friend.
Yeah.
Yay, Camp Friendship! Here's your tent, Cory.
Tent number two!
The same one me and Freddie had last year.
Camp!
Here's your stuff, kiddo.
Thanks, Mummy.
Here's me and Freddie winning the six-wheeled race last summer.
And here's us at the end-of-camp bonfire singing the Camp Friendship song!
Sounds pretty lit.
Oh! And this one's of us at Firefly Cave.
Firefly Cave?
Yeah, it's this cool cave that Freddie and I found,
where you can catch tons of fireflies.
Oh, lightning in a bottle.
But Firefly Cave is a secret just between me and Freddie
so no snitching.
Okay. Our lips are sealed.
Well, I hope you and Freddie have a wonderful time together, honey.
Chrissy, time to go, honey.
Chrissy camp too.
Chrissy.
All right, Cory, call us if you need anything.
-Love you! Bye! -Bye!
Bye!
Now, let's see.
Where do I start?
Looking good.
Now all that's left is for Freddie to arrive.
Well, if it isn't my best friend--
Frannie?
Hi, Cory. Can you make some room for me?
Okay, let's put the massage chair over there,
hang my humidifier on the back wall,
and the mini fridge will have to go under the bed.
Frannie, what are you doing here?
I'm camping, Cory.
Careful with that TV!
-Please? -Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
No, I mean this isn't your tent.
Is this tent number two?
Yeah.
Well, then it's my tent.
But I'm supposed to room with Freddie.
I saw him driving into tent number six if you don't believe me.
Hey! Turn on the TV! The Miles of Our Lives marathon is starting.
Thank you.
Six?
Freddie?
Freddie!
Freddie, I-- Huh?
Oh, hey! Can I help you?
Oh, my gosh. Sorry.
I must have had the... wrong... tent.
Cory!
Freddie!
Gosh, how long has it been, buddy?
Too long! Summer hasn't been the same without you.
We have so much stuff to catch up on!
And so much stuff to do together!
-Now that you're here. -And now that you're here!
I missed you, buddy.
Me too, buddy.
Hey, did you bring the stuff for... Firefly Cave?
Of course!
Cool. Check this out.
Hey, guys.
Coast is clear.
We're gonna catch so many fireflies this summer.
-Hey, guys, whatcha looking at? -Nothing.
Wait, you guys haven't met. Cory, this is my cousin Rosie.
Hi, Cory.
It's her first time at camp. We're gonna be tentmates together.
You're sharing your tent with her?
Yep. She's gonna hang out with us for all of camp.
Doesn't that sound great, Cory?
Great.
I just hope we don't run into any…
fire hydrants!
Fire hydrants!
Cory, you see, this one time, we were driving…
and there's this fire hydrant--
Freddie, you have to tell him the part where Aunt Susan--
Oh, right! So we were celebrating my aunt Susan's 60th birthday.
She had six scoops of ice cream on her plate.
Okay.
And she started talking to this... fire hydrant.
It was an outdoor party.
-Okay. -And it was...
yellow!
Wait, what?
Yellow!
Sorry, I guess you had to be there.
Yellow!
Camp Friendship friends.
Please report to the field.
Time to get going. Let's get the camp fun started, Rosie.
You said it, yellow fire hydrant!
Rosie, you're too much!
So, looks like Freddie's got a new friend.
It's fine. Everybody knows I'm Freddie's camp buddy.
Yeah, sure. Keep telling yourself that, Carson.
Who's ready for camp activity?
Camp activity!
Freddie, I think I got one!
-Cool! Nice one! -Look, I caught a fish!
-I caught it! Look at my fish! -Oh my gosh!
-It's bigger than Aunt Susan! -It's the biggest fish in the lake.
And when she opened her trunk,  it was empty!
On your marks, get set, go!
Cory, slow down!
Cory!
We won! We won, Frannie! We won!
Oh, my gosh! Are you okay, Freddie?
Yeah! Did you see how you tripped,
and I tripped one and then we both tripped?
I know. It was hilarious.
Hey, Cory! You ready for tomorrow?
-Tomorrow? -Yeah! Firefly Cave?
-You still want to go? -Yes, I've been waiting all summer for it.
-Haven't you? -Yeah! It'll be just like last year.
-It's gonna be the best! -Best!
I can't wait to catch fireflies too!
Wait. Wha-- Huh?
Yeah, I forgot to tell you. Rosie's gonna join us tomorrow.
What? Why?
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone. I promise.
It'll be so much fun. Just the three of us.
Oh, yeah. The-- the three of us.
Well, I better get going.
Okay. I guess I'll see you tomorrow morning?
Yeah, sounds good.
-See you then! -Bye, Cory.
Eh, good enough for me.
Previously, on Miles of Our Lives.
Sorry, Fernando. I can't hang out today. I promised my new friend Roger we'd go to the mall.
I promised my new friend Roger we'd go to the mall.
Not the mall!
I hope you don't mind. You'll be okay on your own,
won't you?
Replace me, will ya? I'll just have to…
split them up.
Split them up?
Cory! Are you ready for… "you know what"?
Split them up.
What'd you say?
Oh, nothing. Where's Freddie?
Oh, he's brushing his teeth.
Hey, I just had an idea.
I love ideas.
Well, great. Come on.
I was thinking you should run ahead
and surprise Freddie by catching a bunch of fireflies.
-Really? -Yeah, Freddie would love it.
Oh, okay.
Great. Just stay to the left, and you can't miss it.
Wait, isn't this path off limits?
Nah, it's fine. That's just how you get to Firefly Cave.
Okay.
Well, great. And remember,
don't tell anybody about Firefly Cave. Promise?
I promise. Okay, I'll see you guys there.
Hey, Cory... You're a good friend.
Yeah, thanks.
Juicy stuff is happening here, Cory!
Cory! Hey, have you seen Rosie anywhere?
Oh… Yeah.
She just... went to put some air in her tyres.
She told us to go on ahead. I gave her directions.
Cool beans. Do you have the… "you know what"?
And you got the--?
Oh, yeah.
Woohoo! Let's go!
Camp Friendship Friendship through and through
I'll always be best friends with you
We all sit down, go round and round
-Best friends are always there -Ready?
Go!
Friendship, friendship's in the air
-Freddie? -Friendliest camp anywhere
You need a tyre, I've got a spare
A friend will always care
Camp Friendship, we love you
Camp Friendship, we love you!
I spy with my little eye...
something green!
-Is it that tree? -Nope!
Is it that tree?
Nope!
-That one? -Nope!
-That one? -Nope.
-That one? -Nope.
That one?
Nope.
Now I spy...
something yellow!
Firefly Cave! It's just like I remember it.
Whoa!
Are you ready to catch some fireflies?
Yeah.
Uh, shouldn't we wait for Rosie?
What? Why?
Firefly Cave is our thing.
I'm just trying to be a good friend.
I thought we were friends.
What? We are.
Then how come we haven't hung out all week?
What are you talking about? We're hanging out now.
Only because Rosie didn't show up.
Yeah, I wonder what's taking her so long.
Really?
What? She's my cousin, and she's never been camping before.
You're acting weird. I'm gonna go and find Rosie.
Freddie, wait.
Freddie, wait up!
Freddie!
-Oh, man. She's in so much trouble. -Maybe she didn't know.
-Oh, man. She's in so much trouble. -Maybe she didn't know. Huh?
What are they talking about?
She broke the rules. -I found her off the Camp Friendship path. -Rosie!
Where were you heading to, Rosie?
I... I promised I wouldn't say.
What?
Rosie, if you don't tell us the truth,
you'll be in even bigger trouble than you already are.
Carley, go set her up on cleaning duty.
Let's go, Rosie.
But that's not fair. She'll miss the bonfire!
I'm sorry, Freddie.
Wait! Rory, wait! It's my fault.
It's-- It's all my fault.
What are you talking about, little fellow?
Well, Freddie and I found a secret cave last year,
and I made Rosie promise not to tell anyone about it.
A secret cave?
Off camp property?
No, it's behind the field, but I didn't want Rosie to go,
so-- so I sent her down the wrong path.
What?
Why would you do that, Cory?
I...
I...
I...
I thought she was taking my best friend away.
What?
Come on, Cory.
You're off the hook, Rosie, but stay on the right path.
Yes, sir.
Cory, wait.
I didn't mean to take Freddie from you.
Hey, Freddie.
Rosie, are you okay?
Yeah...
Cory gave me this.
His... firefly net?
Friends are always there
Always there! Camp Friendship
Oh, man!
Friendliest campground anywhere
You need a tyre, I've got a spare Oh, man.
Oh, where did you come from, little guy?
Hey! Cool, you guys are so cute.
Whoa!
-Pretty nice, huh? -Freddie?
If you can't go to Firefly Cave,
then Firefly Cave comes to you.
This is so cool.
I'm sorry for being a bad friend, Freddie.
Cory, while I don't condone your actions, I understand why you actioned them.
You know, we're still friends, Cory. We'll always be friends.
Thanks, Freddie.
You ready to catch some fireflies?
Yeah! How did you catch all these anyway?
Oh...
Rosie helped.
Oh, yeah.
Where is she?
Well, I thought maybe you'd want to hang out just you and me for a bit?
The only thing is...
it might be hard to catch all these fireflies
without someone really fast.
Look over there! Cory, on your right!
There's one behind you!
Dear Santa Cars, all I want for Christmas this year
is the Honkin' Henry Extreme.
Batteries not included, so please send some.
It comes in an assortment of colours, and really, any colour will do,
but to be honest, I like orange the best.
I'm not sure why.
Love, Cory Carson.
-There. -Cory?
Christmas is three days away. Those cookies will get stale.
I know! I'm just so excited about getting the Honkin' Henry Extreme!
I want macaroni, please!
Well, we'll see what Santa brings.
-Did you hear that? -Let's go check it out.
What happened?
You crashed into our garden. Where were you headed?
Well, I was headed straight to…
to… to…
I don't remember where.
Do you have an address we could look up?
I can't seem to remember that either.
You've got a big dent.
You must've hit your head.
-We better get you inside for now. -Good idea.
Thanks for letting me stay, but I should really be getting back to…
somewhere.
-Nonsense. Stay as long as you need. -I'll find some blankets.
Why does he look so familiar?
Hello there!
Hi!
And who might you be?
My name's Cory.
Hello, Cory, my name's…
It's…
-Well, I don't really remember my name. -Yum.
-Well, I don't really remember my name. -Yum. Cookies!
Chrissy! We're supposed to be saving those for…
Santa…
Santa Cars is in my house!
Excuse us for a second. Come on, Chrissy.
Chrissy! It's Santa Cars.
Santa? Where?
In the living room. Look.
Those kids.
Daddy?
No, not Daddy! The other guy.
-I've got your blankets. -Why, thank you.
That's not Santa.
Look closer.
Hey, maybe you left your wallet in your back.
Good thinking.
Where did these presents come from?
-Santa! -I can't remember.
Macaroni, please.
OK, Chrissy. Time for bed.
Macaroni!
Hey. I've got something for you.
Something for me?
Yeah, here you go.
Thank you, Cory.
This is a very nice envelope.
Sorry I don't have something to give you.
That's OK. I can wait three days.
What's in three days?
Come on. You don't have to pretend with me.
I know!
You know, three days…
till Christmas?
Christmas? What's Christmas?
Wait, you really don't remember?
If you don't remember you're Santa, nobody's gonna get their presents.
I'm not gonna get my Honkin' Henry Extreme, and Christmas…
Christmas is gonna be ruined! Mummy! Daddy!
What's wrong?
He doesn't remember what Christmas is. We need to go see Dr. Wiperglass now!
Yup, it appears he has amnesia.
Oh no.
Oh no. Could you explain what that is? You know, for the children.
Amnesia is when you can't remember anything, even who you are.
It can happen when you bump your head.
What? How long until he can remember?
Could be a while.
Christmas is in three days!
Well, some cars recover faster if they're surrounded by familiar things.
So if I show him familiar things, he might remember who he is?
He just might.
OK.
Come on, Santa.
Is that me?
Am I Santa?
If you are, I could really use a new espresso machine this year.
OK.
I'll have you remembering in no time.
The most important thing about Christmas is toys.
This place has got tons of toys.
Hey, does that guy look familiar?
No, but he sure is a handsome fellow.
-Why does he have that funny hat? -What? That's Santa Cars. That's you!
-Really? -Come on, let's look at the toys.
Here we go. Soak it in. This is what Christmas is all about.
Toys, toys, toys.
Look at that one. Yeah, this is a nice toy.
It's so happy. Do you remember Christmas now?
Come on, remember.
Sorry, nothing.
Don't worry. This next thing will definitely work.
Behold, the Honkin' Henry Extreme!
How fun is that?
It's got turbo boost and sonic sound sirens.
-That's neat. -Yeah, I hear it can even do backflips.
Sounds merry and bright.
Well, Santa, you should know.
Santa.
You've had tons of letters about it, right, Santa?
Santa?
Santa?
Sorry, Cory. I still don't remember.
Man, I really thought that would've worked.
Santa?
Santa!
Hello, children.
-Santa? -Santa.
Santa!
Run!
It's perfect.
Pardon me!
That was a close one.
-I guess I'm really popular. -Look out, someone's coming.
Be careful with those decorations! Thank you.
That's it. Maybe decorations will help you remember.
He's over here. Just come look.
Cory, you expect me to believe that at this very moment,
parked on my front lawn, is…
-Hi, Cory! -Santa Cars. Oh my gosh!
Wait. He hit his head. He doesn't remember who he is.
Really? Jeez, what are we gonna do?
I'm working on it. Could you do me a favour?
I'm working on it. Could you do me a favour? -Plug in your Christmas lights? -Sure.
-Plug in your Christmas lights? -Sure.
Get ready.
So, Santa, do you remember Christmas now?
No.
I still don't remember a thing.
Hello there.
Am I on the nice list?
Great idea! Santa, you remember the naughty or nice list, right?
The naughty or nice list? What's that?
The list you keep of all the cars that are naughty or nice.
Like, me and Freddie are on the nice list.
So, who's on the naughty list?
Hi, Cory. What do you want?
Well?
-What's going on? -She seems nice to me.
What? Oh no.
-Your calibration is way off, mister. -Wait, what's happening?
This is worse than I thought.
I'm gonna show you everything there is about Christmas. Let's go!
Nope.
Nothing.
OK.
Come on!
Me?
Come on!
Yeah, you've got it.
No. Oh no. No! No!
Santa!
Look out!
Cold!
Yeah!
Snow!
It's almost time for the tree lighting ceremony.
What? It's Christmas Eve already?
Oh no!
If you don't remember by tonight, nobody will get any presents.
I won't get my Honkin' Henry Extreme!
No macaroni?
Oh no.
Christmas will be ruined.
All right, kiddos. Let's go.
You should come.
Maybe the Christmas music will ring some bells?
Bells!
I love you.
Bells? Wait a second.
That… That sounds familiar.
Oh my gosh. Bells? You remember bells? Come on, let's go!
Cory, slow down.
Come quick. This way.
We'll definitely find something here.
How's this? Do you remember this bell?
Sorry.
How about this?
Does this remind you of anything?
Nope.
Sorry, not this bell either.
What? There's got to be something that'll work.
Welcome to the Bumperton Hills tree lighting ceremony.
We'll be decorating the tree together,
and Eileen will top it all off with "The Carol of the Bells."
This is it. This'll definitely work. Come on!
This is gonna be great!
Awesome.
What do you think, Santa?
Santa?
Higher, Daddy, higher!
Higher, Daddy. Higher!
I… I remember now.
Really?
-I remember everything now. -You remember you're Santa?
No.
I remember my family.
My name is Benjamin Bell.
What? Benjamin Bell?
Yes, Benjamin Bell. I'm from Spoiler Valley.
-I live there with my family. -Family?
-I live there with my family. -Family? -Did you get your memory back? -You're not… Santa?
-Did you get your memory back? -You're not… Santa?
I…
I guess not.
You're not Santa.
Sorry, Cory.
That's… That's OK.
I'm glad you remembered who you are.
Thanks, Cory.
Wait.
If you're not Santa,
that means… the real Santa's OK!
He's probably delivering gifts right now.
Yeah! Christmas is saved!
-Yeah! -Well…
-Yeah! -You know what to do with this.
My letter. I've got to put this up for the real Santa. Let's go, hurry!
Honkin' Henry, here I come!
Milk and cookies, check.
Letter, check.
Everything else, check, check, check.
It's all done.
Spoiler Valley? That's a three-day drive.
Three days?
I'd better get going, then.
Are you sure?
It's dark and icy out there. We wouldn't want you to get hurt again.
I guess I won't see my family for Christmas this year.
You're more than welcome to stay with us.
Thanks, that's… -That's very kind of you. -Try and get some rest.
-That's very kind of you. -Try and get some rest.
Goodnight, Ben.
Come on, kids. Gotta get to bed so Santa can deliver presents.
Macaroni!
I'm sorry you won't be able to spend Christmas with your family.
Me too, Cory.
Thanks for helping me remember. I'm glad Christmas isn't ruined.
Yeah.
Cory!
Coming!
Goodnight, Santa.
I mean, goodnight, Mr. Bell.
Dear Santa, I've been thinking a lot about Christmas lately, as you always do.
I've been thinking a lot about Christmas lately, as you always do.
A lot of things make Christmas, Christmas.
The toys, the traditions, the lights,
the toys…
But today, I learned that Christmas isn't just about getting gifts.
It's about giving them.
Sometimes that gift can be a hug or a song or a bedtime story.
Christmas isn't about what's under the tree.
It's about who's around it.
I know it's super late,
but I wanted to switch my Christmas wish.
For my present this year, I want my new friend, Mr. Bell,
to be able to spend Christmas with his family.
I hope it's not too much trouble to change my wish.
Thanks for all the hard work. And merry Christmas, Santa.
Love, Cory Carson.
Christmas!
It's Christmas!
Cookies are gone.
-Presents are under the tree! -Presents!
Ben's not here!
Santa brought Mr. Bell home to be with his family!
Brought who home?
Wait, what are you doing here?
I stayed the night. Remember?
But my letter. My wish.
-I wonder who that could be. -Your wish?
-I wonder who that could be. -Your wish? What? Didn't you get your toy?
What? Didn't you get your toy?
I changed my wish.
Changed? What did you change it to?
Benjamin?
Betty? Junior?
How is this possible?
-Oh, we missed you, Benjamin. -Daddy.
How did you get here? Everyone, this is my family.
Oh my goodness. We're just opening our Christmas presents.
Why don't you  join us?
This is Papa. This is Cory and Chrissy.
Seems like we have lots to talk about.
I brought you some gifts.
Hey, buddy. Did you get your Honkin' Henry Extreme?
I got something better.
[narrator] This is George Beard and Harold Hutchins.
George is on the left with the tie and flattop.
Harold is on the right with the T-shirt and bad haircut.
Remember that, now,
except George is actually Harold, and Harold is actually George.
They're dressed that way because they've always loved Halloween,
a holiday that celebrates creativity instead of stifling it, like Arbor Day.
Kids, go plant a tree! Gar!
-Isn't Halloween great? -[Krupp] Werewolf! Run for your lives!
The greatest.
[both] Trick or treat!
Wearing costumes and getting free candy!
-What could be better? -Do you mind, bumblebee?
I'm trying to take a relaxing guacamole bath!
Nothing could be better, that's what.
[both] Trick or treat!
-I wish tomorrow was Halloween, too. -I wish every day was Halloween.
[Krupp] I'm not a rhino!
I'm a man! -[screams] -[roars]
-I think that was a real werewolf. -Yeah. Solid tackle, too.

[narrator] Chapter One: Hallowaiting Game.
One month before Halloween.
-Hot chocolate? -[sips]
Thanks, I needed this. How long you been up?
Never went to sleep. Too excited.
T-minus four hours till Hallowarehouse opens.
-[wolf howls] -I love Hallowarehouse.
It's all the best parts of Halloween:
candy, fake skulls, fake blood, fake eyeballs,
fake Dracula fangs, fake werewolf claws,
real flashlights, crammed under one roof.
[announcer] This Halloween, only Hallowarehouse can save you...
money, because candy corn's on sale!
We're gonna be the first ones in,
which means we'll have our pick of the best Hallo-wares.
This was the greatest idea we've ever had!
Almost as good as the trick we played on Melvin last Halloween.
Zombie plumbers?
But I don't wanna be eaten or have my sink fixed!
[groaning] Melvin!
Ugh, this fake blood is sticky.
Or the trick we pulled on Melvin last, last Halloween.
Ghost pool cleaners?
But ghosts are fake and I don't have a pool!
-[George in spooky voice] Melvin! -[Harold] Ha!
Oh, this harness is pinchy. [laughs]
Or the trick we pulled on Melvin last, last, last Halloween.
Stay back! Stay back!
There's only one Melvin, and it's me!
-Wrong, you unstable isotope! -Ha!
Ugh, these glasses are blurry.
Phew, this episode is flashback-heavy so far. Sure is. Here's to us, buddy.
Sure is. Here's to us, buddy. -[clangs] -[sipping]
Doors open in five, four...
Three, two-- -[crowd screaming, goat bleats] -[Harold screaming]
-What do we do? -Grab some stuff!
-What stuff? -Any stuff!
-That was amazing! -Yep.
That's gonna be a great story for our grandkids.
-Back in my day... -[snoring]
What did you think of those Skeletorches costumes?
[announcer] Skeletorches! We don't even know what they do.
They were fine, but the ones we're gonna make will be way better.
[Krupp chanting] Hall-No-Ween! Hall-No-Ween! Hall-No-Ween!
What this side of beef means, by his inexcusable pun,
is Halloween must be canceled!
What? But you love Halloween!
Wrong! The only thing I despise more is you two.
Oh, yeah. I must be thinking of Bo.
-Pssh! Halloween can't be canceled. -No? [laughs]
That's what you said about Gorilla Lawyer.
Well, that's different. The gorilla went nuts.
-[man] Get off the building, Karl! -[roars] Get off the building!
Yeah, Halloween is bulletproof.
-Aah, why? -[gasps]
[narrator] Three weeks before Halloween.
Okay, a lot of Halloween ground to cover, so let's dive right in.
Good notes on our Skeletorches costumes.
We can dial it back.
Can't unsee that. Can't unsee that.
Gooch, you were undecided on your costume yesterday.
-Any update? -Yes. I'm going as a dinosaur.
Sorry, but dinosaur is my thing.
It's the only costume that fits me.
Okay, what about a pirate?
Like, I'm going as a pirate queen.
Sophie One is my parrot, and, ugh, Other Sophie is, like, scurvyyy.
-Ninja? -Taken. Smoke bomb.
Don't worry, buddy. We'll make you a costume.
Okay, but I kind of don't wanna be traumatized by a costume.
No offense, so I'll just go back to Hallowarehouse and get a new one.
[announcer] Those who enter Hallowarehouse never leave...
empty-handed, because clown masks are half off.
Quick candy scouting update.
Based on our intel, these houses are giving out the best candy.
Chocolate Mufflelogs, Sugar Beardies, and, my favorite, Fruit Swirvel.
Oh, and we got a tip that Mrs. Wrinklefoot is giving out used gum again,
-so stay frosty. -[both gasp]
Finally, let's do a quick trick check.
Quick trick check. Qui-Quick trick...
Oh, that's hard to say.
TP, check. Eggs, chicken and ostrich, check.
Shaving cream, check.
Fake snakes, check.
Sorry, I'm doing fake snakes.
♪ Fake 'n' snake! ♪
Man, I can't catch a break.
Oh, sorry to smash your pumpkins, you demagnetized magnets,
but Halloween is soon to be Hall-No-Ween!
Another victory for the candy intolerant, of who I am...
one...
of them.
To be clear, I'm candy intolerant.
-But you love Halloween! -No!
I told you earlier, in no uncertain terms, I despise it!
Oh, right. Thinking of Bo again.
It's true. I'm a Halloweeniac.
Not gonna happen, Melvin.
You're the only kid who hates Halloween. And no one listens to Krupp.
-[clangs] -No, I said pizza!
These are socks!
Oh, really? Then where are they going?
-What are our parents doing here? -And where are they going?
And you can support Hall-No-Ween by wearing these T-shirts.
The e-mail said free cookies.
At the end. The end!
-Guess someone does listen to Krupp. -Yeah, but they're adults.
And no one listens to adults.
[narrator] Two weeks before Halloween.
[announcer] Skeletorches!
They're skeletons who are on fire, we think.
Mom, Dad, Halloween's almost here. Where's the candy?
Ugh, I've been too busy to buy it.
We should get it after Halloween when it's practically free.
No! We need candy now!
They're trying to cancel Halloween, and we can't let them win!
-Who's they? -I am not overpaying for candy!
Mom, Halloween is in trouble,
so I need you to start hanging cobwebs and stop painting Mr. Meaner.
I can't! He's mesmerizing!
-[gasps] Mesmerizing. -I'm a yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah work of art.
[narrator] One week before Halloween.
Hall-No-Ween signs?
Where are all the Halloween decorations?
No skeletons, no coffins,
no decaying zombies clawing at the dirt, trying to escape from the grave?
Where's all the fun?
At least Old Man Rattlechains is getting into it.
Yeah, but his house always looks haunted.
I heard he's a zombie.
[George] I heard he's a zombie-werewolf.
[Harold] I heard he went to college with Dracula, borrowed Dracula's car,
and crashed it into the dean's pool, but that's probably not true.
And don't forget to show up tonight for the meeting at city hall
on the future of Halloween.
Or should I say "Hall-No-Ween"?
-[tires screech] -Hey, where did that stop sign come from?
You're a menace. Your license should be revoked.
Joke's on you. I don't have a license.
-You thinking what I'm thinking? -Never get in a car with Krupp?
That, and we're going to that meeting.
And the motion to add a tar pit and dinosaur-friendly benches
to Piqua Park is denied.
Byah!
-Hey, George and Harold. -[both] Hey, Diddly.
A lot of orange in here.
Yep, and bad orange, like, biohazard orange.
Next, we'll hear from Principal Krupp on his motion to...
cancel Halloween?
But why?
-Adults of Piqua-- -That's not a microphone.
-You're not a microphone! -[gavel clatters]
For too long, we've suffered the horrors and inconveniences of Halloween.
It's time to cancel this spine-chilling, hair-raising, bloodcurdling atrocity.
If we don't, here's what will happen. Melvin?
A probability algorithm beyond your comprehension
found there's a 97-percent chance this simulation is our future
if Halloween continues.
These are the candy mines where you will all work until you drop.
-[electronic chirping] -So, who's with me?
I don't know about all this. -I kind of like Halloween. -[Krupp] Oh, do ya?
-I kind of like Halloween. -[Krupp] Oh, do ya? Do you kind of like buying a bunch of candy just to give it away?
Well...
Do you kind of like your doorbells being rung over, and over, and over,
and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over,
-and over, and over, and over, and over? -[all] No!
Do you like your houses, cars, and trees covered in eggs,
-shaving cream, and toilet paper? -[adults] No!
Do you like living in fear of the werewolf who wants to wrap you in a giant tortilla,
fry you, and eat you like you're a kruppichanga?
You've derailed. Taking over.
The answer is no!
Because today we turn Halloween into Hall-No-Ween!
[chanting] Hall-No-Ween! Hall-No-Ween!
-Wow! I finally started a chant. -Hall-no-ween! Hall-no-ween!
-Wow! I finally started a chant. -Hall-no-ween! Hall-no-ween! Hall-No-Ween!
Whoa, Melvin started a chant. I thought he loved Halloween.
You're thinking of Bo. And we need to turn this around.
-We just need... our parents! -I hear ya!
Mom, Dad, Harold's Mom, you've gotta stop this madness.
Yeah, if they cancel Halloween, what's next, summer?
I hear you, but I hate doorbells.
And candy is terrible for you.
And Mr. Krupp is right, that werewolf does want to ichanga us.
Plus, these T-shirts are lovely. Lovely.
All in favor of canceling Halloween, say "byah"!
[all] Byah!
The byahs have it!
[both] No!
Aah! How?
I can't believe they canceled Halloween.

We need to make the adults remember what's great about Halloween,
but they won't listen to us.
Yeah, adults only listen to other adults... and jazz.

No, an adult.
Who has the most to lose if Halloween is canceled?
-Us? -Besides us.
-Ghosts? -No. Hallowarehouse.
[announcer] Hallowarehouse will be the end of you...
shopping for Halloween stuff, because we have pre-carved pumpkins.
Pre-smashed, too!
No Halloween means no Hallowarehouse.
So, if we ask the owner of Hallowarehouse to help us save Halloween, he'll say yes.
Genius! But who's the owner?
You're never gonna believe it.
[narrator] Chapter Two: Haunted House Call.
[Harold] Old Man Rattlechains owns Hallowarehouse?
Told you you'd never believe it. It makes sense.
-I mean, look at his house. -[wolf howls]
-I'm not going in there. -Sure, you are.
That's why Erica's here, to show you there's nothing to fear.
-There's nothing to fear, except zombies. -Zombies?
-Just kidding. -Phew!
-Or am I? -[screams]
-Nah, I'm just kidding. -[gates creaking]
-Why so many gates? -[creaking continues]
And why are they all so creaky?
Halloween, guys. Eyeball on the prize.
Wolf-howl doorbell. Nice touch.
Yeah, I'd love it if I wasn't so scared.
-[wolf barking, howls] -[gasps] Wolf-howl door knocker!
Question: why do you love Halloween if you're afraid of it?
Because Halloween makes fear fun!
-Seriously, all these hinges need oil. -Not now, Harold!
-[deep voice] Yes? -[all scream]
Oh, sorry. Forgot I was wearing this costume.
Forgot about the mask, too. Apologies.
I test-wear every costume we carry at Hallowarehouse!
So, you're Old Man Rattlechains?
Call me Creeply.
Your name is Creeply Rattlechains?
A name like that doesn't leave you a lot of options.
Well, it was either Halloween store or magician.
So, um, yeah. Come on in.
This is not what I expected at all.
Yeah, it's nice, Home Snob nice.
[announcer] Coming up on Home Snob...
Like this house? Too bad!
You can't afford it.
Why doesn't the inside look like the outside?
The haunted house vibe scares people away better than an alarm system.
Plus, I love Halloween.
Or I did until those Hall-No-Weenies canceled it.
That's why we're here,
to convince you to help us convince them to uncancel it.
Yes!
And when we're done, they'll beg for murder!
I mean mercy!
-Why are you yelling? -Guys, you heard Krupp.
Halloween is nothing but work for adults.
Candy, decorations, jack-o'-lanterns,
costumes, trick-or-treaters, pranks,
and a big mess to clean up when it's over.
Yeah, but adults like work.
And some adults love Halloween, especially if they own Halloween stores.
No, she's right.
So, we have to remind all adults why they loved Halloween
before they became adults
by scaring their pants off with a haunted house.
Yes! Because skeletons plus fear equals love.
-Not so sure about that math. -I am.
That's why I opened Hallowarehouse.
Fear is a blast! Yeah!
Glad you feel that way,
'cause we're gonna make the inside of your house match the outside.
What's that, now?
[narrator] Chapter Three: The Scarent Trap.
[narrator] To lure adults into the haunted house,
the boys dangled the one carrot no adult could resist.
Uh, do you think they're really giving away free batteries here?
I don't know, but for free batteries, it's worth the risk.
Not for me. I'm waiting outside.
No, you're coming in.
That's why Erica's here, to convince you there's nothing to fear.
There's nothing to fear... except werewolves.
Werewolves? [screams]
-[distant people screaming] -This is the way to free batteries.
There's plenty of tomb! I mean room!
-Why is he yelling? -[chainsaw buzzing]
-It's so spooky in here! -[man cackling]
And I do not see any free batteries.
-[boy] Boo! -[all scream]
See? I told you this was a mistake.
That was amazing!
It was even better than the haunted house I went to when I was ten! When I was ten.
So good! So good.
Halloween's awesome!
You need to sign this petition to uncancel it.
Boys, what are you doing in here?
Forget it! I hate being scared!
-Can we go again? -Sure. Just sign this petition.
-I knew this would work. -Yep. It's in the Halloween bag.
I want double-As, Cs and nine-volts, lots of nine-volts!
Your free batteries are right in-died!
I mean inside! Inside!
Why are you yelling?
Hello, robed stranger.
Will you sign our petition to uncancel Halloween?
No! Instead, I've turned your fake haunted house
into a real nightmare with my Inanimanitator 2000!
It animates the inanimate.
-It brings lifeless objects to life. -You mean like string, or socks?
Or a comb, or ham, or volleyballs?
Yes, all those things!
And now, when your living Halloween decorations
scare the adults to death, it will be the death of Halloween forever!
Evil laugh!
Eh, how bad could it be?
Bad. We need Captain Underpants.
Aah! Bones! -Save me from the bones! -[roars]

Yeah, really sorry about that.
Good news is we got a bunch of signatures to uncancel Halloween.
Great!
My house and all my worldly possessions are a small price to pay for that.
-Let's go celebrate! -[gate creaks]
Just need to do one thing first.
See? So much better.
I don't believe it. All I had to do was oil the hinges?
Huh, who knew?
Everyone. Now let's celebrate.
Everyone. Now let's celebrate. -[Krupp] Yes, let's celebrate my victory. -[gasps]

Sophie One, get ready to throw Other Sophie under the bus.
Other Sophie, get ready to go to jaaail.
I guess that's it. Halloween is officially history.
History? Let's talk about history.
When the Vikings told Columbus America didn't exist, did he quit?
[Harold] No! Columbus got on his dragon and flew until he found America.
[George] Did the Romans give up when they had nowhere to go to the bathroom?
[Harold] Nope! Flushus Bowlicus invented the toilet, and problem solved.
[George] And when the aliens closed space, did the astronauts pack it up?
[Harold] No way! The astronauts took the aliens' rocket for a space joyride.
Not a single thing you just said was true.
Yeah, we don't know history.
-But you're right. -But we do know Halloween.
So when the adults say Halloween is illegal, what do we say?
[chanting] Hall-No-Way! Hall-No-Way!
-So, you have a plan? -I always have a plan.
Coming to the Hall-No-Ween victory party?
Someone might bring cheese.
No, you empty salt shaker.
George and Harold love Halloween as much as I love DNA Day.

-Hey! -[gasps, screams]

'Kay, more cheese for me.
-[jazz playing] -[announcer] Cheese!
I don't have a plan. I don't even have a cool name like Skeletorches.
[announcer] Skeletorches! They like tea, sure!
-Time for a comic? -Comic it is.
[Captain] Captain Underpants and the Huffy Holihater!
By George and Harold.
[comic narrator] So, one time, Holihater, a bad guy and boring dresser who hated holidays,
used a Holiray to vaporize all the town's Halloween stuff.
Candy, berzap! Overpriced pumpkins, kergok!
Even inflatable owls, for what?
And he was all, "Anyone who says 'Halloween' gets vaporized, too!"
That threw a wrench into Captain Underpants's Halloween party.
But his party pal Tony was all like, "Just hack it, man.
Lose the H." 'Cause Tony.
So, Cap Captain Underpants hacked his Halloween party
into a no-H All-o-ween party.
"Wow, so smart!" "Really?"
Everyone showed up with whatever:
pillows, drywall, tires, a roller skate, you name it.
And instead of Halloween costumes like Dracula, Frankenstein, and the mummy,
people dressed as Doctorca, an orca who went to med school;
and Scorpionion, half scorpion, half onion, all monster;
and Frobra, a frozen cobra!
'Cause All-o-ween, no H, was the Wild West of holidays
with fewer cowboy hats and horse cars.
But when people posted pictures online, due to low self-esteem,
Holihater saw them and crashed the party to shut it down.
And Captain Underpants was all, "Party foul!"
And he dunked Holihater in Tony's mystery punch,
which was just lemonade, pickle juice, and ketchup,
'cause Tony, agh!
And Holihater was all, "Ugh, too pickle-y! I give up!"
Turns out Holihater only hated holidays because he was never invited to parties.
So Captain Underpants gave a toast, "To a holigreat guy!"
And everyone got pucker face from the punch.
Then the cops showed up 'cause there were noise complaints.
"Too loud!" Okay, the end.
-So, we're gonna hack Halloween? -You mean Hack-A-Ween.
[narrator] One day before Halloween.
I mean Hack-A-Ween.
[Krupp] We did it! Halloween is finished!
Tomorrow night there'll be no costumes, no candy, and no doorbells.
Just peace and quiet and a bathtub full of guacamole.
To Hall-No-Ween and cheese!
We should have a victory party. Tomorrow night!
What? This is the victory party.
What if we all have victory parties tomorrow night?
No, no, no! It's tonight. We have cheese!
Ooh! And we can all go door to door to each party.
Byah! Byah!
And we should wear costumes! Costumes.
And give out yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah candy!
-And hang skeletons in the trees. -And fight the toilet zombies.
No. No! That's Halloween!
We want Hall-No-Ween!
Oh, no!
No, the cheese! [sobs] Oh, no!

Can't breathe? That's a job for...
Melvinhaler! Melvin, he's got the need!
Yes! Uh, yes! I am Melvinhaler!
And by the power of bronchial dilators, I will open your airways,
expand your troubled lungs, and end wheezing!
Whoa, that needs work.
Thanks for the air, nerdy bear!
-Now, how do I let the air out of them? -You don't.
Lieutenant Long Johns and Deputy Drawers do!
Courtesy of Mrs. Wrinklefoot, who really stepped it up for Hack-A-Ween.
But how do we get into kabob range?
Captain Underpants, can you create a distraction
so we can get close enough to burst those bubbles?
I'm all distraction... and cheese!
♪ Tra-la-lamb kabobs! ♪
The bounce stops here-- [groaning]
I can't pop them!
So let 'em pop themselves!
Can you bounce back from bouncing?
Spin-offs for the Hack-a-win!
-[panting] Help! -Help!
Whoa, you're like a rubber wall!
I have those in my room.
Time to pull out all the pops.
Kabobs!
Why am I wet? Where are my pants?
-Boom! We Hack-a-won! -Yeah!
Good thing this isn't one of those movies where you think it's over, but it's not.
Uh, anyone seen my house? -It's missing. -[stomps]
-[George] Found it. -But how is it moving?
Well... [chuckles] I may have blasted the house
with the Inanimanitator to bring it to life.
What? I was angry!
-Time for round two, Cap U! -[snapping fingers]
Don't snap at me! I'm not a bird!
He's still wet. We're on our own.
We lost Halloween. We can't lose Hack-A-Ween!
Yes! We must save Hack-A-Ween because I'm having fun now, so it matters!
Don't worry, nothing three spin-offs can't handle.
I-I'm sorry, did you say three?
The Spinoffs!
Starring Lieutenant Long Johns and Deputy Drawers and Melvinhaler!
By George and Harold.
Sooooo, Halloween so!
The Spinoffs do what you always do when your house is crawling with life--
they called an exterminator.
Lieutenant Long Johns and Deputy Drawers kept the house busy
with a heroic game of ding dong ditch, ding dong!
While Melvinhaler took a deep, cleansing breath
and turned the exterminator's tent into the Nonexistent 2000.
Pssh-kank-sqwork Nonexistent!
The Nonexistent convinced the stuff in the house
it wasn't alive anymore, and problem solved!
Spinoffs!
Gosh, good thing exterminators take care of monster houses.
-So, when can I move back in? -Not for a year, at least.
A bill? Seriously?
[Mayor McChapper] And while Hack-A-Ween wasn't perfect,
it was the perfect reminder that all kids love Halloween.
-I feel like candy! -Mm, mm, mm!
Even if they are adults.
-Candy rules! -Mm, mm, mm. At any price!
And these costumes are inspiring! [chuckles]
-So good. -I love being someone else.
Are you a yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah mirror?
So, all in favor of bringing back Halloween?
[all] Byah!
The byahs have it!
-Halloween is reinstated! -Aah!
-Double byah! Byah! -No! No!
Hey, look!
"Halloween meeting tonight. Bring your own snacks."
"Halloween is back! Get your ghost on."
Ugh, sorry, Melvin.
Oh, don't be.
I'm not really candy intolerant.
That was just an excuse I used to minimize the unpleasantness of Halloween.
I actually enjoy candy. Watch.

[narrator] Chapter One: Merry Twistmas.
Six months later, it was finally Christmas.
-[siren wails] -Cheer was in the air
and smoke from a small grease fire at Chancy Chicken.
Man, you can't beat Christmas at Christmastime.
Yeah, it's like having Christmas at Christmas!
I'll say, you tangled string lights.
And nothing says Christmas like a lukewarm mug of ham nog.
I'll take the hit. What's ham nog?
A one-of-a-kind beverage and precious holiday treasure,
made from baked ham, raw eggs, smoked oysters, and a dash of cinnamon.
This holiday season, fill your cup to the brim with Smickleflap's Ham Nog.
Hammy holidays.
-Ugh! Tastes like low tide. -[stomach rumbles]
It checks all the boxes-- smoky, creamy, chewy, fishy, chunky.
[gulping] Ah! -That sounds awful. -To a primitive palate.
When they discontinued it, I bought every last gallon
and put it in my Freezydoesit 2000 to preserve it for the next 10,000 years.
No! [sobbing]
Every Christmas, I allow myself a few drops of this precious nectar.
-I kind of wanna taste it now. -Never!
Because it's all for me and you're nog nothings.
Ha! Nog burn.
Man, Melvin liking Christmas is not a good look for Christmas.
-But even Melvin can't ruin Christmas. -Nope, 'cause Christmas is perfect.
-[thudding] -I hear rustling.
-Probably gloves. -[jingles]
I'm getting wind chimes and... -[jingles] -...nine iron?
-Trying to guess gifts again, huh? -Yeah, this one's for you.
-[glass shatters] -Ooh, you're getting broken glass!
[sighs] Tell you what, since we can't open presents yet, how's about a sneak-read
of 'Tis the Eve 'Fore the Day 'Twas Christmas?
But that poem's for Christmas Eve, which is two weeks away, George's Dad.
I know. That's what makes it naughty and nice.
-[cat growling] -Did someone mess with my chair?
-'Cause it's all... [grunting] -[cat growling]
Now I can't get it to-- Why won't it just--
-Ah, perfect. Here we go. -[cat hisses]
"'Tis the eve 'fore the day 'twas Christmas.
The village is brimming with cheer.
The blacksmith is smithing..."
-What's "smithing"? -No idea.
-"...seamstress is seaming..." -What's "seaming"?
-Beats me. -"...for soon old Saint Nick will be here.
With eight flying reindeer a-pulling..."
-I gotta say, this poem's a little rusty. -Yeah.
And these sweaters are pretty ugly and itchy.
All this waiting-- waiting for Santa, waiting to open presents,
waiting for Grandpa to go back to Boca so I don't have to sleep on the floor!
waiting for Grandpa to go back to Boca so I don't have to sleep on the floor! -[loud snoring] -[rumbling]
Maybe Christmas isn't perfect.
Maybe it could use some upgrades.
Yeah, might be time for a Chris-makeover.
Let's slide.
"And with that, Santa whispers..."
So, instead of red bows, how about laser shows?
You mean like this?
Instead of peppermint...
[Harold] Super-spicy-sour-salty-scorched- banana-apple-berry-blast!
-Instead of ugly sweaters... -[George] Cool Christmas capes!
-Instead of jolly old Saint Nick... -[Harold] Jacked new Santa!
-Instead of tired, sad carols... -[George] Holi-DJs!
-Instead of bland ham... -Corn-dog-taco-pizza-chili-changa!
-Instead of boring, decorated trees... -Titanic tree-bots!
We're gonna need more than a day to fit all this in.
-So we make Christmas a whole week! -Yes!
We should make a comic!
[Captain] Chapter Two: Captain Underpants and the Christmas Chaos,
by George Beard and Harold Hutchins.
[comic narrator] A couple of months before Christmas, Santa was testing new toys.
One was a robot named Roguey, a war-bot who made lots of noise.
But Roguey the Robot went rogue.
Not surprising because of his name.
He took Santa hostage and warned,
"Pay the ransom 'cause this ain't no game."
The ransom was one jillion dollars
and a motorcycle that flies and shoots flame.
"Pay or Christmas is cancelled," he warned,
"'cause, again, this ain't no game."
The world didn't have that much dough, so they did the only thing they could do.
They called for the hero in undies, and in Captain Underpants flew.
When Captain Underpants heard about Santa,
he said, "Oh, no! That's really bad!
But don't worry, folks. I love Christmas.
It's my favorite time to wear plaid."
Captain Underpants' mission was clear: save Santa and Christmas, too.
'Cause if he failed, no holiday party, not even 'O Howly Night at the zoo!
Captain Underpants flew to the North Pole.
A weird snowdrift made him look twice,
so he dug and he dug and he dug and he dug,
and he found a jail in the ice!
Here's the thing about prison-- it can change a man, and that's a fact.
So when Captain Underpants found Santa, he was no longer jolly.
He was jacked!
Robots charged in from all sides.
The heroes were caught in a trap.
Roguey was all, "Game's over, you fools!"
"But you said this ain't no game," said Cap.
Captain thought they were goners, but new jacked Santa stepped in.
They fought side by side like Pro-Bowlers, and they smashed all the bots for the win.
To celebrate, jacked Santa declared that "Christmas would have a new name."
From that day on, it would be Blissmas and be a whole new ball game,
with lasers, explosion, and fun, and steaks, and dance music, and parades,
and jalapeno poppers, and ape racing, and monster trucks, and horse climbing,
and French toast, and a party that lasts a week,
and a dinosaur made out of fire, for some reason,
and, oh, yeah, this was supposed to rhyme.
Okay, the end.
"...presents under the tree, then helps himself to a cookie or three.
They fought side by side like Pro-Bowlers
and they smashed all the bots for the win."
Hey, that's not right.
-No, it's better than right. -Because we made it awesome.
To you.
-But Christmas isn't-- Ya! -[cat growling]
-My chair is so-- Just can't get it to... -[cat growling]
Okay, I need a new chair!
Oh, wait, there's the button. -[cat hisses] -Ah!
But Christmas isn't about you, it's about everyone.
Instead of thinking about ourselves, we think about others.
Mom? Were you here the whole time?
-Mom? What are you doing here? -Giving.
That's the spirit of every Christmas tradition.
-[music plays] -Singing for other people, baking cookies for other people,
giving presents to other people, even this poem.
It's about how Santa puts everyone before himself.
That's his thing.
[narrator] It's also this Christmas special's thing. Thanks, George and Harold's parents.
Where's that music coming from?
Sorry, I was watching Lee Dingman's Christmas movie,
Christmas Lee's Christmas Tree, on my phone.
♪ Christmas Lee's Christmas tree ♪
♪ A place for joy, not punching ♪
♪ Unless there's a ninja attack ♪
G'ah! Ninja attack!
-[ninjas] Merry Christmas! -Oh, you got me,
you crazy Christmas ninjas!
That's what we're talking about. Even Lee Dingman is boring at Christmas.
But if Christmas was more like our comic, it would be better.
Better for you.
Exactly! And better for us is better for everyone.
All is know is Christmas ain't broke, so don't fix it.
[Harold's mom] Oh, no! Eternal darkness.
[George's mom] Lock the doors, board the windows!
Candles were a tradition until someone started a better tradition: lights.
Yeah, so was black and white TV until they invented color.
And every Christmas tradition started somewhere.
Stockings, uh, Cyber Monday, even Santa Claus.
Man, I'd love to see how Santa got started.
-Too bad that's impossible. -[narrator] Nothing's impossible on TV.
Welcome to Toys of London,
the world's biggest toy store 300 years ago.
Toys of London is the top toy titan.
You have all the toys--
dolls, marbles, rattles...
and that's it.
I propose you stop selling toys and start giving them away!
But that's not all.
We're going to wrap the toys
and put them under a tree inside your house!
And we're gonna call it-- wait for it...
Christmas!
-Why? -Exactly!
-Now, who's with me? -Mr. Claus--
Oh, call me Santa. Mr. Claus was my father. [laughs]
Very well, Santa.
If we give our toys away, how will we make any money?
You won't!
So, we got a deal?
Why are there teacups here?
Oh, right... [sputters] it's England.
[narrator] Chapter Three: That's Show Fizz.
Not again.
Coast is clear. It's copy time.
Once we put a copy of our comic in the hands of every person in Piqua,
-Blissmas will be a go. -[Anthrope] Help.
Was that Ms. Anthrope calling for help?
Nah, that was the copier.
-[Anthrope] Help. -Hope it doesn't break.
-Me, too. Can I help? -Yeah, grab some more paper.
-Ooh, and toner. -Sure thing.
But first, why don't you get in my office right now?
[Anthrope] Help.
Was that Ms. Anthrope calling for help?
-No, that was the copier. -[Anthrope] Hel--
Misallocation of school copying resources?
[laughs] Ooh, that's a serious offense.
What to do?
You could give us your keys.
[Krupp] Ah! Let me in! It's my house!
And I have to go number two!
You could nominate us for membership in your Yak Lodge.
Let me in, let me in! I'm a Yak!
You could take us on a Christmas cruise.
-[boat horn blares] -Let me in! I paid for this cruise!
Boys, Christmas is my favorite time of year.
Three weeks of paid time off with nothing but a roaring fire
and a freezer full of steaks I got dirt cheap at the Beef Thief.
[Beef Thief] Steaks, roasts, burgers.
If it's beef, we got it.
And at prices so low, you'll swear it was stolen.
'Cause it was.
-[police siren wails] -Uh... gotta go!
But there's one thing about Christmas I can't stand.
-Christmas fudge flab? -[screams]
-Christmas credit card debt? -[screams]
No! The school Christmas pageant.
Isn't Ms. Hurd in charge?
She was, but apparently Ms. Hurd passed away last year.
-So who directed it last year? -Her ghost.
But now her ghost is retiring.
The good news is I can finally shut down the music program.
The bad news is none of the other teachers will step up.
You have to direct the pageant!
You're a gym teacher! You know about theater!
-Yeah-yeah-yeah, no-no-no-no. -Is that a yes or a no?
-You're sending mixed signals! -Ah!
-Christmas pageant! -[screaming]
If I don't find someone to direct the pageant, I'll have to do it.
And I'd rather be eaten by sharks than spend more time with you kids.
-But you're a school principal. -Ugh, don't remind me.
-But the good news is-- -You already said.
There's more good news! And the good news is I've found someone!

You're right, and that's why we should totally upgrade it.
Hey, guys, we all love Christmas, but what if we made it cooler?
'Cause that's what we're gonna do.
We're turning "Christmas" into "Blissmas," starting with the pageant.
We've been asleep at the Christmas wheel, and it's time to hit the Blissmas gas!
-[kids] Yay! -[Bo farts]
Sorry. Meatloaf Monday.
Don't be sorry, 'cause Blissmas doesn't apologize for anything.
[kids] Yay!
-Can I lose these sleigh bells? -Only if you want to.
[kids] Yay!
Wait, I like sleigh bells.
I love this.
It's new, it's bold, it's uncompromising.
But our parents won't be on board.
All things change, and Christmas is a thing.
You gotta break some eggs to make egg nog.
Egg-xactly, and I know a thing or two about nog.
George and Harold's pageant is going to be legendary.
-Really? -Yes.
A legendary train wreck!
I'll have a front row seat to enjoy every moment of it
with a room temperature mug of ham nog.
Okay, let's wreck this pageant from the top.
-Why does it smell like the pier? -[Melvin] Ham nog!
[narrator] Meanwhile, 300 years ago, Christmas was still a hard sell.
Because if The Eiffel Toyer gives its toys away,
it will inspire people to think about others before themselves.
Croissants.
And if people think about others before themselves,
thanks to Toysland Uber Alles, they'll be happy.
Ah, bratwurst!
And if everyone is happy, the world will be a better place,

Oh, cheese!
"Big school Christmas pageant tonight.
No shoes, no shirt, no Santa show!
-Break a leg, kids." -[both laugh]
[Harold] "Tonight is Blissmas and Santa is going to town."
Nice! Now, let's get naughty.
[narrator] Chapter Four: Swing and a Christmas.
Oh, hello, parents of some students.
And you, too, other parents of some other students.
[laughs] I did it.
I made George and Harold direct the Christmas pageant,
and I didn't even check on them.
I'm a Christmas genius!
Aren't you worried that George and Harold changed the pageant?
No!
-Wait, what? -[all gasp]
-Oh, no. -It's Christmas Eve.
The War on Christmas has raged for centuries.
But this year, 2127, is the year a hero rises from the tinsel
-and Christmas becomes Blissmas. -[all gasp]
Because Santa's coming to town to kick some bot butt.
Thanks, Dasher. You, too, Dancer and Prancer.
Love the new look, Santa.
You're, like, super jacked now.
Stay frosty, Christmas commandos. That explosion woke up the metal heads.
We're gonna have to blast our way out. Good. Let's wreck the halls!
Ah! The metal heads have force fields!
-Our lasers can't break through! -No, but the mistletoe missile will.

-Why what? -Yeah. Can you be more specific?
Why did you change the pageant?
Everybody loved that old sap-fest! And you ruined it!
Now the parents are furious and they're taking it out on me!
So I'm going to take it out on you.
Get ready for some ho-ho-hard labor.

Why was there a dinosaur? And why do I have to sit in the middle?
What's so bad about Blissmas?
Blissmas is for you.
Christmas is for everyone.
-And everyone loved that pageant... -[soft piano music plays] ...until tonight.
Too bad more people didn't love ham nog.
Now, that made for a hammy holiday.
-Getting rid of it was a Christmas crime. -[piano music stops]
Maybe the real crime was not giving Blissmas a chance.
-[music resumes] -Boys, I want you to read this.
"'Tis the Eve 'Fore the Day 'Twas Christmas."
-We read it. -But you don't get it.
Christmas was about putting others before yourself right from the start,

Ugh, this pageant punishment sure is pungent.

Unless we use Melvin's Timetoad to go back in time
and change Christmas before it starts.
Yes! Exactly what I was thinking.

My first childhood toy was a stick.
It made me so happy.
But giving it to my neighbor Maurice made me realize true happiness
is putting others before yourself.
I went around the world looking for someone else
who wanted to put others before themselves like me,
but everyone said no.
That's when I realized I'd have to make it happen on my own.
So I emptied my bank account and moved to the North Pole to make a fresh start.
♪ Fresh start! ♪
[Santa] But it was a lot colder than I expected.
Luckily, that's when I met the elves.
And they loved my presentation,
so they helped me build this cottage and a workshop for toys.
And now we're a lean, mean, toy-making machine.
[chuckles] Well, maybe not so lean 'cause of all the cookies,
but that's all there is to eat here.
You know, it's the Arctic.
[boys] Yeah!
-[Harold] Whoa! -[gift honks, rattles]
[George] Santa's workshop!
This is the sleigh, and you've met the reindeer.
Now, once we're loaded up, I'm going to fly around the world,
giving trees and presents to everyone.
And tomorrow, December 25th, the world will be a better place,
full of lights and bows and festive songs and colorful sweaters
and, most importantly, the joy of putting others before yourself,
all thanks to Christmas.
Heh, that's what I'm calling it.
I'm kind of hoping people do the tree part themselves next year
'cause this sap is really sticky.
Anyways, that's the plan. What do you think?
-It's a good plan, really. -But what if you think bigger?
Instead of red bows, laser shows!
Instead of ugly sweaters, cool capes!
Instead of decorating trees, creating tree-bots!
Maybe this will inspire you.
Oh, pictures!
-Ooh, got any more of those cookies? -Tons.
[chuckles] It's a problem.
But my New Year's resolution is to hit the gym,
soon as it gets invented, 'cause it is the 1700s.
Yeah, all right, "A couple of months before Christmas,
Santa was testing new toys..."
-"Okay, the end." -And that's not all.
You're giving presents to everyone, right?
-Well, what about Santa? -Maybe Santa gets a present.
Uh, maybe it's a boat.
Whoa, I've always wanted a boat.
Well, this changes everything!
Elves, I'm calling an audible!
Boys, you just booked permanent spots on my "nice" list,
which is another thing I'm starting.
Ugh! I got a tummy ache.
Maybe that's because you ate every single cookie we had!
G'oh! Sap!
He's on board. Let's head home and see if it sticks.
And let's skip ahead to Christmas Eve in the present.
Good call, 'cause there's no waiting in Blissmas.
[narrator] Chapter Seven: So Did It Work?
Huh, I thought things would change, but everything looks the same.
Guess it didn't work after all.
[man over PA] Celebratory tree ignition in three, two, one.
-Hit the dirt! -[fireworks whistling]
I'm hitting it as hard as I can!
But it's not working! Make it stop!
You make it stop! You have powers!
Oh, yeah. Why can't I remember that?
Okay, tree, it's time for you to make like a you and leaf.
Or at least stop burning.
Why am I wet? Where are my pants?
And why am I an ornament now?
Whoa, auto tree refill. A treefill!
-[siren wails] -[chuckles] So good.
Kid, get out of the blast zone!
And Mega Blissmas!
Mega Blissmas? Does that mean--
It worked! Blissmas is a thing!
♪ Got a burning tree That's a rocket, too ♪
♪ Got a DJ dropping beats That'll make you scream "whoo" ♪

[Harold] Now, that was a Christmas song.
-Because it was a Blissmas song. -Yep.
I can't believe Santa got us everything we wanted for Blissmas,
including a chili geyser!
Blissmas is the longest week of the year.
A whole week of this awesomeness?
Including a whole week of presents!
It just keeps getting better and better!
Yeah-yeah-yeah-- Ow! Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-- Oh!
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-- [grunting]
I can't wait for, yeah-yeah-yeah, Blissmas to be,
yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, over!
-Ow! -Not better for everyone, I guess.
Yeah. Mr. Meaner always loved Christmas.
Merry yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah Christmas!
Look what I got at Rent-A-Reindeer!
Ho, ho, ho!
Who's got yeah-yeah-yeah mistletoe?
Our parents aren't so wild about Blissmas either.
Yeah, but they're adults. Adults are never happy.
[Santa] Ho, ho, ho! Mega Blissmas!
People of Piqua, this is your Santa speaking!
Time to get your butts to the Piquarena for tonight's Mega Mechalition Derby!
Mechalition Derby?
No idea what it is and it's my new favorite thing.
Hey, guys! You ready for some Mechalition derby?
We're not asking because we just got here and we have no idea what it is.
Giant robots smashing into each other again? Eh.
"Eh"? But Blissmas is so awesome.
At first, but then it's just loud, pointless, and obnoxious.
Like Other Sophie. Sophie burn!
Wait, I thought everyone loved Blissmas.
-What about the lasers? -Seen it.
-And the music? -♪ Heard it! ♪
-The Ho-Ho-Ho-ller Coaster? -Been thar.
-Virtual Blissmas? -Done that.
-[roars] -Aw, the Blissmas bobcat bit me again.
You guys are crazy. Blissmas is awesome!
Yeah. You could be decorating a tree instead of launching it.
That actually sounds nice.
Okay, but would you rather have boring plates of cookies
or exciting cookie drones?
Boring plates! Boring plates!
I'd like to eat one thing, baked, like a ham,
instead of a bunch of stuff ichanga'd.
Singing is easier when you're not winded from dodging.
♪ Dodging! ♪
[grunts, panting] ♪ Need oxygen ♪
Wow, it'd be nice if everyone spent this holiday
putting others before themselves, especially Santa.
What do you mean? Santa always thinks about other people.
That's why he gives presents to everyone.
Wrong! Santa doesn't give presents to anyone.
He gets presents.
-[both] Whaaat? -[fireworks whistling]
Whoa, wait, wait. Where are your presents for Santa?
We don't have any.
You don't have presents for Santa?
[elf] Where's your present for Santa?
I forgot it.
[elf] Maybe this will help you remember.
Remember Santa's present, remember Santa's present...
George, this present thing is bad.
Is Blissmas a missmas?
Nah. Nothing we can't fixmas.
Don't worry, guys. We're tight with Santa.
We'll wrap this gift rift.
Gift ri-- hmm.
Gift rift. That's hard to say.
Oh, hey, it's Yule.
-And you got the suit you wanted. -Do I know youse?
Oh, that's right! You haven't met us yet 'cause time travel.
Anyway, Merry Blissmas!
Merry? You mean "Mega" Blissmas.
And where are your presents for Santa?
-We don't have any. -[gasps] Ooh!
Why does everyone keep doing that?
Tell Jingle Boss I got a couple of gift-less Garys coming his way.
[narrator] Chapter Eight: Santa Flaws.
This is way better than a Christmas party.
It's like a North Pole night club.
[announcer] The North Pole's hottest dance club.
It's so exclusive, no one gets in, because it's a glacier.
Exactly. Blissmas is amazing.
All we gotta do is fix this gift goof with the big guy and we're golden.
Yeah, if we fix the GG with the big G, we're G.
I found the big G.
-[Santa grunts] -Emphasis on "big."
Georgetown! H-Bomb!
You remember us?
Of course. I'm Santa!
-Jacked Santa! -Yep.
I put down the cookies and picked up the weights.
Oh, you guys want a Blissmas protein shake?
I got Ultra Fudgealanche and Big-Time Bacon-Berry Blitz!
-We love what you've done with Blissmas. -Isn't it great?
It's got everything-- lasers, capes, rides, lasers, music, spicy food,
robots, lasers, and lasers!
What am I saying?
You guys know all that 'cause it was your idea!
We just have one small question.
Why are you getting gifts instead of giving them?
Oh. Well, giving was a Christmas thing!
Christmas was for everyone.
But this is Blissmas, baby, and Blissmas is all about me!
That's not in our comic.
Hey, you were the spark, I'm the fire!
Yeah, but maybe this fire's out of control.
That's what makes it Blissmas, baby.
And don't worry about getting me a gift.
Youse two get a pass on presents. You're VIPs!
After all, without you, there's no Blissmas!
Right, but what if, and I'm just spitballing here,
you tried giving presents instead of getting them?
Yeah, and then Blissmas would be perfect.
Whoa.
I gotta think-squat-thrust about that one.
Yeah, okay, I'm good. Good-good-good brain burn, there.
Here's the deal.
The spirit of Blissmas is "go big or go home," am I right?
-It is? -Yep! And I never go home.
Well, I go home after Blissmas. But I'm here now, so you're on!
-Really? -Sure!
All you have to do is win the Blissmas Mechalition Derby!
-Say what, now? -Win the Blissmas Mechalition Derby!
-Say what, now? -Mechalition is the big kahuna
of Blissmas traditions.
If you guys defeat all the robots, I'll do whatever you say!
And if we lose?
You join my elf team.
After all, if it's not high-stakes, it's not Blissmas.
Uh, yeah. We so know robo.
Right, we're so robo-gung-ho.
[narrator] Uh-oh. No, no.
Like you two single cells could ever defeat my robots.
Melvin? You work for Santa?
I don't work for anyone, entry levels.
I'm a robo-consultant.
So, no dental plan?
I'm in it for the nog.
Mm, gummy! [snaps fingers]
I built robots and Santa gave me all the remaining ham nog on Earth.
Mm, oystery!
I don't know why he likes it. It tastes like fish fire!
That's because those vile protein shakes destroyed your taste buds,
you hulking cry for help.
I can't believe ham nog is a thing in this timeline, too.
Yeah. Maybe we should give it another shot.
-It's even worse than I remember. [gags] -[coughing] So gluey.
Aw, come on. We haven't even started yet.
Sorry, buddy. I'll get some tape.
This is a lot more dangerous than I thought.
-And we so don't know robo. -Nope. We're robo no go.
But who needs bots when you've got briefs?
I told you, Steak or Break, you'll never break me.
I just wish I had more stomachs and more steak.
Krupp's here? Man, talk about luck.
-Or lazy writing. -[fingers snap]

But I got a steakache.
Better put a steak on it.
Captain Underpants, we need you to win a robot demolition derby.
But I'm not a robot.
We can fix that with tin foil.
-Fixed. -[laughs] I'll say!
I'm like a burrito now.
[narrator] Chapter Nine: Season's Beatings.
[Santa] Mega Blissmas!
Are you Blissmas bandits melting down for Mechalition?
Robots, take the battlefield!
Okay, Cap, get out there and show them who's ro-boss!
Will do.
But first, where's the ro-bathroom, 'cause I gotta ro-go.
Not now. You gotta win so Santa gives everyone presents again.
And then everybody will love Blissmas as much as we do.
[narrator] In case you forgot why they were doing this.
Okay, I'll try to ro-hold it, but no promises.
Hey, how's it going?
You a robot here for the robot fight?
Yeah, me, too. You can tell 'cause I'm shiny.
Mega Blissmas to all, and to all a good fight!
Ho-ho, I'm steaking you down! Nailed it!
Huh?
Hey, wait for me.
[Captain] No! My meat!
That was a big mis-steak.
Get it? 'Cause steak!
-[crowd cheers] -Captain Underpants, you did it! You saved Blissmas!
This calls for a steak dinner!
Ugh, I'm all steaked out, but I left room for pie!
Ho-ho-hold on!
Santa? You look different.
Did you get a new head, face, and body?
I said you had to beat all the robots.
He did beat all the robots.
Not quite. Melvin!
Behold, my greatest Blissmas robot.
-Mechthehalls 2000! -[crowd cheering]
Heh, I forgot to mention, I always win Mechalition
because Blissmas is all about me!
Yeah, he's definitely gonna win.
[narrator] Chapter Ten: The Incredibly Graphic Violence Chapter
presented in Deco-Rama, because when it comes to robot Christmas trees,
if you can't beat 'em, decorate 'em.
No cane, no gain.
Get it? 'Cause-- [grunts]
Watch out for these Santa claws.
Meow-- [grunts]
And a jar on top.
Wait, is it a jar or star? I can't ever remembe-- [grunts]
[sputtering] Yep, I'm getting my ham baked.
But the good news is my mouth tastes like a clean bathroom.
-[Captain shouting] -He's getting his jingle bells rung.
-[grunting] -Of course.
What part of greatest Blissmas robot was unclear?
Mm, briny.
Remember what that ham nog did to Melvin's robot chair?
-Yeah, it totally jacked it. -Right!
So maybe the nog will wreck the walls for Mechthehalls.
Yeah, but Melvin loves that ashy, stretchy goop
more than anything in the world.
Small price to pay to save Blissmas.
[growls] Captain Underpants, you need to nog that tree!
Okay! Beats losing.
Nog!
Five-second rule!
We did it! We beat all the robots!
So Santa will start giving presents instead of getting them.
-[narrator] Just in case you forgot. -[gasps]

Right, because you're Santa
and you're gonna punch me until I'm unconscious.
Ooh, my nose is glowing. It's like a night-light for my head.
"'Tis the eve 'fore the day 'twas Christmas.
The village is brimming with cheer."
[Santa] There is no Christmas cheer, only Blissmas fear!
"The blacksmith is smithing, the seamstress is seaming,

No. No, he won't.
I'm-I'm here! I'm Mechanaclaus!
Hey, are you supposed to be glowing like that?
"Eight flying reindeer a-pulling his sleigh."
"Full of gifts to deliver all in one day."

for reminding me what Christmas was meant to be.
I don't know what I was thinking for the last 300 years.
Well, it's kind of our fault
'cause we went back in time and gave you our comic.
The point is Christmas is back.

-Or maybe a treehouse upgrade? -[Krupp screaming]
Anything. Name it, and it's yours.
Thanks for my giraffe guy, Santa!
-Come on, Jeffraffe. -[crying, slurping]
[George] 'Tis the morn of the day that is Christmas.
Blissmas is no longer a thing.
[Harold] For Christmas was already perfect,
though Blissmas had lots of zing.
[George] And why is Christmas so awesome?
For a reason both simple and true.
[Harold] 'Cause Christmas is all about others instead of being all about you.
-Uh... -[pig squeals]
-[Melvin screams] -Hammy holidays, Melvin.
And to all a good nog.

What if something would've happened to you?
Don't you think you were being reckless?
Madam, I'll get going then.

-Sir, she's lying, I did nothing wrong. -Sir, this man molested me.
One at a time, please. Madam, calm down.
Sir, you must arrest this liar!
One person at a time. Please, madam!
-This man is a liar and a pervert-- -Silence!
You do realize you're at a police station, right?
Don't create a scene!
Attach that medical report here.
-Sir, he's lying-- -Keep it down, will you?
-What's the matter? -Let me explain, madam.
-He forced himself into my house-- -Madam, she's lying--
Everyone calm down and step back!
-Stay behind that line. -Step back! All of you!
Behind that line.
-May I have your name, madam? -Neeru.
Tell us exactly what happened.
As I was saying, he forced himself into my house and attacked me--
Is he an acquaintance?
-He's our landlord. -Madam, I--
-Your name, sir? -Madam, believe me--
Your name!
Vishwanath.
Tell me what happened.
So, we've been his tenants for years.
It all started with him raising our rent.
I told him I'm already struggling to make ends meet.
So, he offered to let us off only if I sleep with him.
I never said that!
When I refused, he forced himself into my house--
You depraved son of a bitch!
Silence!
Do not utter a sound unless I ask you a question.
Yes, go on.
He threw himself on me and groped me.
I see.
-What about this man here? -He is my husband.
-May I have your name, sir? -Tilukaat.
Anyone else in the family besides you two?
We have a son.
-Was he at home? -No, he was at school.
-And you? -I was at the farmers' market.
Who called the emergency number?
Madam, I did.
I see.
When did you do it?
When I got back home
I saw this man forcing himself on my wife.
I never once--
You think I'm blind? I caught you red-handed, bastard!
Enough of all this shouting!
If anyone shouts or cuts in again, I'm throwing you all in the cell.
So you called the police. Then?
When I walked in, I saw my wife resisting this man
and without wasting a second, I called the police, madam.
I see. You may speak now, sir.
Madam, I've rented out a small portion of my land to them.
-However-- -Where do you live?
In the same neighborhood.
Now, they've occupied a much larger area than I had allotted.
He's making up stories. He just wants to kick us out.
Miss, you've had your chance. Please don’t interrupt.
When I told them I'll raise the rent, this man turned hostile.
And this lady followed me all the way to my house
creating a scene in the neighborhood.
Look, what this monster did to me, madam!
Do you still think I'm lying?
Please cover yourself.
-I asked for the medical report, man. -Madam, we have a lot more to tell you.
Yes, I'm listening. Be patient.
-What about your family, sir? -Madam, I have a wife and a daughter.
Madam, this man isn't the real owner of the land either.
He leased it from the government, with no permit to rent it out.
Madam, I've had it for years now.
Renting helps with the income for my household.
-Believe me, I have done nothing wrong. -"Nothing wrong"? What a sick man!
He wants to steal a poor woman's home
and has assaulted her in front of her husband.
-Keep it down, please. -No, I won't keep it down!
I demand that you arrest this man immediately!
Do not tell me how to do my job!
Sir, where did you say you were? Farmers' market.
Since when do we have a farmers' market on a Saturday?
Don't fool me with your theatrics. I want everyone out!
-But, madam, we were saying-- -I don't want to hear another word!
Go sit outside, all of you.
Come on, move it!
No tea today?
Let me ask someone.
What do I do with them?
Clearly, the lady is making up a false case.
The whole fuss is about the land.
See if you can broker a deal between them.
Okay.
The independent witness wasn't even at the scene
so how can he give a statement?
Sir, if we're the only witnesses, the case may seem weak.
I don't care! This is not the way.
See what's written in the man's medical report.
Disgraceful.
What was the commotion with that lady all about?
-Madam, it was a land-related dispute. -What?
The whole uproar was about the rent.
So, why was her blouse ripped? Show me the formal complaint.
Madam, it was all an act.
A total farce.
Just some bickering with the landlord over rent.
I didn't know we were running a tribunal here!
Soni, do you ever follow what I say?
Chauhan, call that woman again. I want a proper complaint filed.
Yes?
I see.
Okay, let's dispatch one constable.
Send someone levelheaded.
They're poor folks, deal with them sensibly.
Okay.
Come on, blow into the tube!
Properly!
Mister, don't inhale! You're supposed to blow into the tube!
Come on!
Make it quick! Get his reading, and impound his vehicle.
Yes, madam.
Stand up straight, fatso.
Why is this car in the middle of the road?
Pull to the curb!
Come on, beat it!
Officer, take him into custody.
Madam, let me know if you want a cup of tea.
There's hardly time to breathe, let alone have tea.
Madam, can you please look into this?
What's the matter?
They're drinking in the car, and refusing to step out.
This vehicle?
-How many are they? -Two.
What's all the fuss about?
They are clearly intoxicated, and not cooperating.
Oh boy!
Sir, roll down the window, please. -Your ID, please. -What?
-Your ID, please. -What? Let's see some ID.
I am Lt. Commander Vikram Rathore. Indian Navy.
Very good, sir. Let's see your ID.
Madam, please teach this man some manners.
He's just doing his job, sir. Your ID, please.
You know what? We need women like you in the Navy.
The ID doesn't have my cell number.
Sir, your ID.
Show it, man! What the fuck!
Had a little too much today, sir?
It's my birthday, and tomorrow I'm getting married.
I see.
We're celebrating my bachelor party.
Sure, we'll celebrate it together. Out of the car, please.
-Why, hop right in! Let's have a drink. -Oh boy!
Let's get him tested.
Sir, please step out of the car.
Listen! Madam!
-Come on! -Out of the car, please.
Listen, shithead! Stay back.
-Don't wag your finger at me. -I'm not even talking to you.
I'm asking politely, please step outside--
Stop calling out to her.
You need to step out.
-Back off! Don't touch me, you pig! -Stop wagging your finger.
Nope, I'm not talking to you.
Please, step out.
-Listen-- -You need to step out of the car, sir.
Listen, I've been polite so far, but now I’m losing my patience.
-I'm telling you-- -Step outside, sir.
Out of the car, please.
-Sir, you're being very stubborn-- -No, you're not listening to me--
We're just doing our job.
Sir, this is wrong--
Sober now?
What do you think you're doing?
Arrogant swine!
Madam, calm down, please.
Hey, you! Put that phone away!
Please pull yourself together.
Madam, please.
Madam--
They are the Navy for heaven's sake. People are recording us on their phones.
I'll gun her down!
Relax, madam. You don't want a scandal here.
Hand me the bloody gun!
You're out of breath.
These damn stairs!
Why did you take the trouble?
Don't worry about me.
Cooking for friends is no trouble at all.
What is this? Did you not eat last night?
I did.
You barely had two pieces of bread.
You work so hard and barely eat anything.
This is convenient, isn't it? Toss them in the machine and done.
And here I'm dealing with backaches after handwashing a load.
You're welcome to wash them here.
I've never trusted a machine wash.
Nothing like scrubbing and wringing with your own hands.
-Tell me something. -Yes?
Your name has been popping up a lot this morning.
My husband was on a call with another officer
and your name was mentioned quite a few times.
Did something happen?
It's nothing.
A man misbehaved with me, that's all.
May I suggest something?
Start applying Sindoor on your forehead.
When I attended sewing school
I remember having to pass through this ghetto.
There were men who'd ogle me shamelessly.
One day I decided to apply Sindoor...
even though our religion does not permit it.
But, guess what? No more stares!
Are you even listening?
Don't just nod! Take my advice...
and say goodbye to your worries. Forever.
Tell me, would you like to have some green tea?
You call that tea?
Thanks, but no thanks to your green tea.
There's neither flavor, nor color.
What's this? Why not cover the windows completely?
-One can see everything from outside. -Who cares?
Crazy girl! Have some sense.
Hey, Soni!
Listen.
Naveen is here.
I just saw him through the window.
Listen!
Look at me.
Let go of your bitterness.
Naveen is on his way up. You two have to talk to each other.
Enough is enough.
-I'll see you later. -Please stay for a little while.
No way. I can't stay.
Hello, Mrs. Huma.
-Where have you been? -How are you?
It's been over two months since I last saw you.
Just been busy with work.
Don't make excuses! She shouldn't have to manage the house on her own.
Well, I'm here now.
Alright. Go see her now.
-You take care. -Okay.
How have you been?
I stopped by last night, but the door was locked.
I figured that you're probably still doing night shifts.
Listen, I...
I brought you something.
No shoes in the kitchen!
Sorry, I just wanted to show you these.
-I want nothing from your shop. -They're not from my shop!
I actually bought these for you.
It's so hot in here.
Is that your lunch on the table?
Better have it while it's hot.
I will.
Okay, I'll get you some water with your food.
-Shoes! -I'm sorry.
I totally forgot.
I'll take them off.
Don't bother.
Why?
Sorry, I forgot that you like warm water with your food.
-Move your bag, please. -Yes, of course.
Warm water is actually very good for the body.
What were you doing in the Civil Lines area yesterday?
-Yesterday? -Yes, last night.
-Yesterday? -Yes, last night. Saw you on your bike with a constable.
Oh, him!
He keeps calling me for advice. Wants me to find a buyer for his flat.
I'm so sick of him.
Wait a minute.
You were at that checkpoint?
I see! That's where the scuffle broke out.
-Why are you here, Naveen? -I'm just here to talk.
Are you done yet?
Good morning, sir.
Can I click another, sir?
-Was that not good? -It was okay. A backup, just in case?
I have work to get back to. You have what you need.
Hi.
How's the new office?
So far so good.
-Two cups of tea, please. -No, Sandeep. It's not necessary at all.
Try it. You'll like it.
Shall we sit over there?
Don't be so formal.
How was your meeting with the Commissioner?
It went well.
He wants to invite us over for dinner.
I told him I'll have to ask my girl.
The new office is looking great, by the way.
Yeah, the paint is still fresh on the walls.
-The smell is annoying you, isn't it? -Just a little.
So...
did he have anything to say about the altercation at the checkpoint?
He is obviously upset.
There will be disciplinary action.
We'll have the official word in a couple of hours.
I am also to blame.
I yelled at her in the team meeting.
I'll tell you what you're guilty of.
You're too softhearted.
You should've seen me lash out at her in front of everyone.
You pamper your team too much.
That's why they behave this way.
Why in my 15 years of service, has no one ever dared stir up trouble?
Sandeep, she's going through a rough patch in her personal life as well.
So, that's another problem.
You start making these personal connections with people.
Don't get swayed by emotions.
Anyway, don't waste your time overthinking this.
You live and you learn.
By the way, those officers were completely wasted.
Which gives the police the right to flog them?
No, manhandling them was definitely uncalled for.
But...
This had nothing to do with the decoy operations, sir.
Understood, sir. I'm sorry.
Yes, sir.
You have a good day.
Why sorry now?
You're having to answer for my mistake.
It's only appropriate, since you report to me.
But it's not!
You shouldn't have to answer for my actions.
If only things worked that way, Soni.
Will this impact our operation?
I called you here
to inform you about your transfer to the Control Room.
You start tomorrow. An inquiry has been ordered.
Madam, as long as you know all the facts, I'm fine.
You know, when I was in eighth grade
I saw this young man getting publicly flogged by three policemen.
The man was howling in pain.
But the three policemen clubbed him until he passed out.
I later found out that he had been stalking girls from my school.
But the howling still made me sick to my stomach.
Daddy's turn.
Stop feeding her cherries.
-Now it's my turn. -Watch out! Make way for Uncle.
Come over, Kalpana.
Happy birthday, dear. God bless you, child.
Happy birthday, dear niece!
That's how it's done!
Nishu, that's enough! Enough, Nishu!
I wonder where the maid has flown off to.
These people can be such slackers sometimes.
You and Nishu are the perfect Capricorns!
Picking up after others.
I think... you turned 30 this year, right?
So...
Any decisions yet?
When are you planning your first one?
I haven't really given it a thought.
You should.
You should decide soon.
There's no point in delaying, you know.
You know...
I have a friend who's a gynecologist. I'll give you her number.
She's quite helpful. In case you need help.
You do want one, right?
Mom!
Mom, don't forget to pack some cake for school.
-There's more than enough. -Nice dress, niece!
Nishu!
You need to stop calling Kalpana by her first name.
She's "Aunt Kalpana." Be polite to your aunt.
I'm not calling her "Aunt!"
Now please go change. Or else you'll spoil your dress.
Aunt and niece always play on the same team, Mother.
I don't mind the fun and games. But I wonder
when is she going to play with her own little one?
You must counsel her.
It'll happen when it's supposed to happen. Don't worry!
I wish I could stop worrying.
Wise is the one who follows the advice of the elderly.
Don't forget, the body clock is ticking.
One must act before time runs out.
Why are you all standing there? Your tea is getting cold.
Yes, let's go. You need to get some rest, Mom.
Yes, I'm going.
It's my duty to advise, but to each his own.
My words fall on deaf ears.
That's enough.
-Are you going to pour the whole thing? -Carry on, my man! Drink up.
Look who's here! Welcome, Sir Kalpana.
We're in luck today!
To be able to steal some of your time.
I've got all the time in the world for Nishu.
Where were you, Your Highness?
Clean up that mess, and put the snacks in the fridge.
Excuse my cough.
So, what's the latest on the queen of rage?
There's an ongoing investigation. Let's see where it goes.
You see, these people crave for the media's attention.
They think they will become famous like that officer, Kiran Bedi.
The root of the matter is
these people engage in domestic violence every day.
So, they are all naturally aggressive.
You've got a point.
Come, sit.
You see, these special buses will offer women a choice.
Our aim is to ensure that they feel safe using the public transit.
Segregation is sometimes necessary to ensure safety.
In case you've just joined us, we have been in conversation
with our honorable guest, Tourism Minister, Mr. Devi Dayal Doshi.
You're listening to Voice of Delhi with me, Arun Roy.
-Govind, make sure you have your dinner. -Yessir.
Good evening, sir.
What's going on here?
A constable found this girl crying in the City Mall's parking lot.
She won't tell us anything. We've been questioning her for a while.
Step aside, please.
Please step out, both of you.
What's your name, sweetheart?
Don't be afraid. Tell me your name.
Where do you live?
Do you live in Delhi?
Then where?
Ranchi.
Do you know anyone here, in Delhi?
Who accompanied you to Delhi?
Don't be scared. We'll soon take you to your parents.
Everything will be alright.
I'd like to have a word.
-Yes, madam? -Can't you see the girl is scared?
On top of that, three men were interrogating her.
-Madam-- -Did you call for a female officer?
I was about to make a phone call.
-I take it you understand the protocol? -We just brought her in--
Spare me your explanations.
Call for a female officer immediately to take her for a medical examination.
-Yes, madam. -Hurry up.
What's the problem with these two?
-Madam, my husband committed no crime. -You sit there.
That woman is lying.
-I swear by my daughter. -Please be seated, madam!
-Please let him go. He is innocent. -Wait!
Hold on a second!
What's this all about?
Madam, it's the lady versus landlord case you asked us to investigate.
We've taken the landlord into custody. She is his wife.
Madam, that day, I was at home with my husband.
I told you to sit down!
-Ask our neighbors. -Sit down.
That woman is lying.
-I have a house to run. Please! -Please wait in the room.
Madam, please, believe me. It's hard for us already.
Don't make a scene!
-Madam, I beg you. Please let him go. -That's enough now.
You're at a police station! Behave!
Where's the complainant?
The lady refused to come and submit a written complaint.
Has she given any statement at all?
No, I think, Soni madam was right.
This was indeed a land dispute, which they have resolved between them.
So, this is none of her business anymore.
-Alright, let the man go. -Yessir.
Can you...
get Soni reinstated?
You said you were interviewing replacements.
None have been any good. Things are looking grim.
Okay.
Let me send a few candidates your way.
But, you're going to dismiss them as well.
I can't believe you're getting sentimental again.
Sandeep, I can't just go and hire anybody.
It's very hard to find an officer like her.
-I know her heart is in the right place. -It's her head that worries me.
I'll counsel her this time.
Kalpana, do not be friends with your subordinates!
-It's not that easy to reinstate-- -At least try talking to the Commissioner.
You know that it wasn't all her fault.
The screen will flash on an incoming call.
Hit the space key to receive the call.
Most importantly, we must maintain a diary with as many details as possible.
Especially the location.
Type in the notes from the complaint in this diary.
The microphone is for urgent announcements.
-You got it? -Yes.
We have a call. Put on your headphones.
Delhi Police Control Room. Good afternoon.
Hello, we are experiencing a foul smell in our neighborhood.
Sir, your location, please.
I'm calling from Sanjay Enclave.
I'll need the exact address, please.
It's building number 22, Sanjay Enclave.
It's a rotting carcass of some dog. The stench is unbearable!
Alright, sir. You'll receive a call from your nearest police station.
But next time, it will be better if you call the Municipal office.
Municipal office?
Yes, they'll take care of it.
Nobody's going to take care of anything. Can I talk to your supervisor?
No, there's no supervisor here.
Tell me what your concerns are.
Well, since you ask so nicely, can I have your cellphone number? Maybe we could talk offline.
Maybe we could talk offline.
Okay, thanks for calling Delhi Police.
One or two such calls are a routine.
Soni madam! Sweet buns?
-Two. -How about three?
Okay.
Anything else?
-Two quarts of milk. -Okay.
-Anything else? -No, that's all.
-Add it to your account? -Yes.
Add it in.
Alright, see you.
Where are you off to?
My elder son needs my help as he is moving to a new place.
I wish he would get married, and let me off the hook.
Look at you!
Wear some warm clothes! You'll catch cold.
They're rather warm.
Will you be able to carry that all by yourself?
-I'll ask someone to help you. -I'll manage.
Listen, did you get the gas cylinder yet?
No, I called the gas agency. It should've arrived by now.
I will call them again today.
Who's going to cook for you?
You worry too much. I can grab fast-food anytime I want.
Alright, whatever you say.
-You must be getting late. -Yes, see you later.
Good evening.

Yes, I'm home. But about to leave for work.
I've been reinstated.
I've had my dinner already.
Naveen, I can't discuss these things right now.
Yes, maybe tomorrow, but I don't know.
Why is the team still not here?
Madam, I just had a phone call with Chauhan.
The team had to respond to an accident.
There's an unclaimed dead body at the scene.
They won't be able to make it, then.
Let's call it off for today.
-Madam! -Yes?
There's a notorious spot nearby.
We've recently had some incidents reported there.
Let's go scout it.
My first case involving an unclaimed body was that of an African male.
No identification at all.
In fact, two of my officers got into an argument
whether to bury the body or cremate it.
Madam...
such cases take a toll on one's sensibilities.
But shouldn't male bodies be easily...
Is this a whore-house? What are you doing here?
We're just college students, sir.
College students, my ass!
You piece of shit!
You think I give a fuck?
Is this what they teach in colleges these days?
Sir, please...
One would guess you belong to a decent family, young lady.
Have you no shame?
-Let's inform your parents. -Sir, please don't do that.
-We'll never come back here. I'm sorry! -Enough of your "sorry" already!
Shove your "sorry" up your ass!
Keep your English to yourself, asshole.
Don't you understand what I said?
Come on, give me your parents' number.
-Or just pay us a fine. -Right, sir. Sure.
Here, you can have this.
-How much is it? -200.
I'll beat the shit out of you, you son of a bitch.
I'll beat the shit out of you, you son of a bitch. You think we're panhandling here?
It'll take us a second to charge you for obscenity in a public place.
How about I throw your sorry ass in jail?
Where you can enjoy watching your family beg for your release.
-I say we lock them up for a night, man. -Sir, please don't!
-I say we lock them up for a night, man. -Sir, please don't! Honey, do you have some on you?
Lover boy with an empty wallet, asking his girl for money. Fucking loser!
Here, take more, sir.
-How much is this? -We're giving you all we have, sir.
-How much is this? -We're giving you all we have, sir. Nothing less than 3000! Understand?
This is all we have. Please take it.
What is this? I'm not your pimp!
Why, what's wrong? Take it!
Too much pride to accept bribe from a lady?
No, madam, these two were engaged in obscene acts.
-I see. -Go home, kids.
-I see. -Go home, kids. -But, madam-- -Out, you two!
-But, madam-- -Out, you two! -Madam-- -Out, I said!
-Madam-- -Out, I said!
Madam, I'll walk from here.
I'll take your leave, madam.
Okay.
-Is the tea any good here? -It's very good!
-Govind, get us two teas please. -Yessir.
-Get one for yourself as well. -Okay.
Madam...
I'll go tell the vendor to make his special one.
He knows me well.
Okay.
-Hey! How are you doing? -Good, madam.
Give me the special one with fennel.
Absolutely.
Great!
-You getting yours? -Yes.
-Pack me a two-egg omelet as well. -Sure!
Not bad.
Don't you like cooking?
I do.
Oh, actually, my gas cylinder ran out.
I've called the gas agency a couple of times.
-I don't know what's taking so long. -Govind can get you one.
-No, madam. I'll manage. -It's nothing. Don't worry.
-Govind. -Yes, madam?
-Please arrange a gas cylinder for her. -Yessir!
-Madam, you didn't have to. -It's okay.
I am still mad at those constables at the park.
-You noted down their names, right? -Yes.
Madam, the roasting you gave them!
I'm sure they'll never forget it.
I was thinking...
even if they weren't seeking a bribe...
we have a whole backlog of cases,
yet, this is how they use their policing time!
I agree, madam.
By the way, what kind of advice were you giving to that girl?
To dress up like a man?
The thing is...
I used to do it myself when I was in college.
Going on a date becomes so much easier.
Don't start again.
Reminds me of my late grandmother...
who was diagnosed with a fungal ear infection.
The surgery required the hair around the ear...
The surgery required the hair around the ear... to be shaved.
She refused because her hair was sacred to her.
The surgery never happened.
The infection spread...
and it became impossible to save her.
Soni.
I wanted to tell you something.
I am opening up a pharmacy shop.
-Your shop folded already? -The bloody supplier ran away.
This doctor I know has told me that there's a 300% profit margin.
Once I get the license, it will be a gold mine.
Isn't it always?
It's been the same story for the past five years.
Make it quick!
They're running late again.
What happened?
They're winding up some paperwork. Maybe another 20 minutes.
I see.
You eat too much junk food.
-I barely had time to cook today. -So, has your new gas cylinder arrived?
I'll go get one tomorrow.
-Govind! -Yes, madam?
Where is her gas cylinder?
Madam... it should be on its way. The order's been placed.
I gave you a simple task. Spare me your lame excuses.
I'll manage, madam.
-No later than tomorrow! -Yessir.
It's as if orders aren't orders, until I raise my voice.
-Did you say 20 minutes? -Yes.
-Wanna get some tea in the meantime? -Sure.
Welcome.
Madam, you really shouldn't worry about me.
This place looks pricey.
I'm not worrying at all.
What would you like to eat?
Just a cup of tea for me.
You go ahead.
How about a Dosa?
Sure.
Two Dosas and two cups of tea.
For what?
I know you fought for me.
I did what I could.
Are things any better at home?
I don't know.
Some days... I feel things are improving.
On other days, they seem worse.
They surely will never be the same.
Once you truly know someone... is it easier to accept them?
-I'll quickly go use the washroom. -Okay.
That way.
-Where's the washroom? -Pardon?
-Which way is the washroom? -Straight ahead, behind that wall.
Thanks.
Hey there!
-What's your name? -Veronica.
Veronica!
That's a beautiful name.
So, how old are you now?
-What grade are you in? -Public School.
Do you have any siblings, Veronica?
Sis, I wanna go pee!
Sorry, she's been holding it in for a while.
-Have you been waiting long? -Yes, but it's locked from the inside.
Someone's probably in there.
Who is it?
Just tell the motherfucker to fuck off.
Bloody hell!
Hello, madam!
How can we help?
Get out of the ladies' room.
-Gentlemen! -Yeah?
Check out that voice!
She's probably an opera singer.
Her voice is beautiful, no doubt.
Madam, why don't you come join us?
That will give us a chance to see other beautiful things about you.
Don't mind these rude rascals.
Probably best to keep the kids away from them.
Just hold it in for another 30 minutes.
We'll be done by then.
Also...
tell the manager, that J.B. can't share the bathroom with anyone.
Bitch.
I got this.
The lady is in the mood.
-All three of you out, right now! -Or else?
I could swear, I've seen her somewhere, man!
You jerked off to her last night!
Your favorite website!
I'd love to see you perform live.
-Filthy pig! -Fucking bitch!
Yes, sir.
I just had a word with your assistant.
Yessir.
I'm surely going to look into it, sir.
Yessir.
Did someone just drop by?
Sandeep?
What's going on?
You need to tell me...
what's going on.
Wasn't last night's operation at the metro station?
Yes.
However, your team got busy
turning a restaurant upside down with Badwal's son.
Badwal, who?
An old friend of Tourism Minister Doshi...
as well as his party's election fund.
I've repeatedly warned you. Haven't I?
Now you see the outcome.
Doshi sent his assistant to humiliate me in my own house.
His son was in possession of cocaine.
Good luck proving this possession!
We can still nab him for consumption of drugs.
And then what? A fine of twenty thousand?
Before any of that happens, you'll be dragged into yet another inquiry.
For someone who's been doing this for four years...
you're incredibly naive!
Are you satisfied now?
Or still hungry for more?
-Now you're being really rude. -What do you expect?
Are you going to pin all the blame on me?
No.
I'm the one at fault...
for listening to you.
I'm tired of repeating myself, that you've got to be authoritative!
Why be a cop if you're never going to act like one?
Each bus will have the presence of a woman security guard
as well as a female fare collector.
The buses will have a CCTV camera
and a host of other safety measures.
Good evening, madam! Please come in.
Here.
You didn't have to do this, madam.
It's okay. It's just food.
How's your wrist?
Getting better. I'll get you some water.
No, I'm fine. You should eat.
I'll get some plates then.
Did that man hit you first?
Soni, I'm asking you a question.
Are you listening to me?
The man occupies the ladies room,
calls me a whore, snorts drugs publicly,
and I'm the one who has to explain myself?
I was also there.
Why didn't you come back and inform me?
We could have easily nabbed him.
He got nabbed anyway.
We're not pressing charges.
Don't argue with me when you don't know the facts!
You can't let him off.
Do you realize what the consequences might be?
What's the worse than can happen?
Perhaps another inquiry?
No more decoy operations?
Haven't we seen their cowardly policies?
Special taxis, segregated buses...
Fenced ghettos will come--
Throw another one!
Too late now. Go!
Bastards!
You bastards!
Go, go!
Hey, stop!
Son of a bitch!
You cowards!
Motherfuckers!
I'll hunt down these motherfuckers!
-Don't bother. I can manage. -Manage?
That's what you've been saying all along.
Is this what you call managing?
We wouldn't have this mess, had I been living here!
Those sons of bitches would have been dead right now!
-You don't have to raise your voice. -Soni, listen to me!
Listen to what? Tell me!
Do you ever listen to yourself?
Always building castles in the air.
At least I live on my own terms.
I don't bob my head and say "yessir" all the time.
Of course, why would you?
When have you ever taken any responsibility?
You never wanted anything that would tie you down, right?
Soni...
I know that you still haven't forgiven me.
You have every right to punish me.
I will accept any punishment.
I would've done it long ago, had I thought it would do any good.
At least give me a chance to make amends.
I know I hurt you. I admit it.
But, at the time, I didn't know what else to do.
I felt ignored to the extent that I thought you didn't need me in this house.
And what's different now?
Look...
I need you, Soni.
And as we stand here in this mess...
I honestly feel that you need me as well.
You really have the nerve to suggest that, Naveen?
It was because of you that I suffered... so much.
I trusted you blindly.
Followed you wherever you wanted to go,
with my eyes closed.
And when I opened them...
you weren't there.
There wasn't even a shadow of you.
Soni, after the termination, my life was shattered as much as yours.
And did you help me pick up the pieces?
The decision was yours.
Yes, it was.
The decision was mine.
But you always wished I'd do it, didn't you?
You weren't even around to stop me.
We could try again.
Is this all a joke to you?
I was doing it with my girl in my car
and this fucking cop banged on my window! He said, "Your car's shaking like a washing machine!"
He said, "Your car's shaking like a washing machine!"
-Hey, you! -Cut it out, man!
Dude, next time, get a fucking hotel room.
Only morons like you would go to a hotel.
Hotels are nothing but traps!
Hotels are nothing but traps! They'll call the cops on you
They'll call the cops on you and those bastards won't let you off without a fat bribe. And--
Dude, hotels have escorts going in and out all the time.
It's only dimwits like you who get caught.
It's not funny, man.
The brothels are running right under their noses.
Well, you can't do shit about it.
Light me a cigarette, man.
We'll be there in an hour.
See you, then.
Offerings for the fire.
Good evening! Warm greetings!
-Happy Lohri to all! -Warm greetings to you too, dear!
-Haven't seen you in a while! -Yes, we've been blessed with a grandson!
-Wow! Congratulations! -Thank you.
-Celebrating the little one's first Lohri? -Yes, absolutely!
Happy Lohri!
Why are all the lights off? Sleeping?
What's with all this mess?
Your mom said you locked yourself in after you came back from school.
Stressed about grades?
What's going on?
Come on, you can tell me.
Nishu.
Because of my period...
I was making frequent trips to the washroom, at school.
When...
When I returned to the classroom after my lunch break,
there was a sanitary pad taped to my desk,
along with a note that said "For those days."
Do you know who did it?
No.
Did you report this to your teacher?
Report whom? Everyone was laughing at me.
Including my own friends.
Felt like shooting them all.
Look at me, sweetie.
Report this to your teacher. Find out who did it.
And you must confront them.
But, remember one thing...
they will always try to get the better of you.
Because they know...
that you're stronger than them.
They fear you.
Some water, madam?
-I'll make some tea. -Please don't trouble yourself!
-It'll only take a minute! -Please! I'd rather sit and talk.
I brought this for you.
The Revenue Stamp.
I've read a few short stories by Amrita Pritam.
Good. This is her memoir.
You're giving me your own copy?
Yes, I want you to have it.
I'm sure you'll like it.
If not all... it should answer a few of your questions.
What is a revenue stamp?
It's a small excise stamp for tax collection on tobacco and liquor.
An esteemed writer once told Amrita Pritam...
that her life was so inconsequential...
that all of it could fit on the back of a revenue stamp.
I can't have you resign, Soni.
If only I was making the slightest difference.
I have a 13-year-old niece...
who's very fond of me.
She said an appalling thing today.
She said that she wanted to shoot all her classmates.
Some of them played a gross prank on her.
In a situation such as this...
did my words make any difference? Who knows?
All I know is...
I comforted her.
-Did you get his statement? -He's being difficult.
-Bring him in. -Yessir.
-Let go of me, asshole! -Keep walking!
-Let go of me, asshole! -Keep walking! -Keep your hands off me! -Just get in!
-I want my phone! -I'm not your butler, shithead.
I won't give any statement! -I want my phone back! -Shut up!
-I want my phone back! -Shut up!
You can't intimidate me. I'm not giving any statement!
Stop your babble!
Madam, I want a word with the Commissioner.
I want the Commissioner!
-Have the charges been drafted yet? -Yessir. "Attempt to Kidnap."
-Add "Criminal Trespassing" as well. -Yessir.
Is this a joke?
Listen to me very carefully!
You know who my father is. Very well!
You can't confiscate my phone like this! I need to call my father right now.
We've sealed your phone. It's part of the evidence now.
I don't care! -Get my father on the line-- -Quiet!
-Get my father on the line-- -Quiet!
Send his father a copy of the formal report.
-Yessir. -Formal report?
Tell him he needs to come in.
You owe me an explanation!
I've been made to sit outside for hours, without even a glass of water.
I know my rights!
You should have thought about them when you occupied the ladies room.
I'm going to file a complaint. You'll see.
Also add "Illicit Trafficking of Drugs,"
-and "Assaulting an Officer on Duty." -Yessir.
Hang on a minute.
Show me the evidence!
You'll see the evidence in court.
-How long a detention did we file for? -Seven days.
-Make it 14, and-- -Madam, listen to me.
Do not interrupt me!
Make sure his call-record is attached.
-Madam, just hear me out... -Let's go, boy!
Madame de Monthabor, Madame de Choisy, Countesse of Lubac,
Baroness of Courcelles, her governess, her chambermaid,
the Marquise de Montaigu, her daughter, her other daughter,
Lady Mary Wortley,
and her friend, whose name I forget, but not her pretty face.
And I forgot the Marquise de Saint Méran and Madame de Volnay.
Just a small sample of your collection,
which has reached my ears here, away from society.
Marquis,
what do you care if my name appears on your list of conquests?
Enjoy my friendship, and drive away this whim.
Madame, you judge me lightly.
Isn't your philosophy based upon lightness?
How can one reason,
and escape superstitions, illusions, complacency,
without an ethereal, agile, light-hearted wit?
Why such inconstancy in a man with such reason?
For the sake of honesty.
Did honesty lead you to seduce all those women?
I seduce no one, I am always the first to be seduced.
You're so sensitive, marquis.
Did honesty persuade each of them of your ardent feelings?
I persuade no one.
I merely expressed the sincere feeling they aroused within me.
Is it not strange, however, that your noble feelings
inevitably evaporate a few days later?
Nature is fickle. That is the way of this world.
It would be dishonest otherwise.
As for me, nature has made me indifferent to the agitations of love and the heart.
It's always seemed to me to be a predictable, tiresome spectacle.
Poor marquis, it saddens me to sadden you.
Despite my indifference to your feelings,
are you still determined to stay a few days longer?
As long as you will allow it, madame.
You will weary, marquis. You will weary, you'll see.
We shall see. We shall observe it together.
Good morning, marquis.
Up already?
Good morning, madame.
Tell me, did you love your late husband?
What an odd question. Of course, marquis.
You truly loved him?
As a wife is expected to love her husband.
Married people sometimes develop sincere feelings.
In truth, I was quite fond of him, until our wedding.
After it was all worry and strife.
Do you regret getting married?
Would you like to know what I think?
I believe it's a pity that marriage is available
to such ill-prepared souls.
Just as one is taught deportment and Latin,
one should be taught about life as a couple before getting married.
Love alone can bring such teaching.
Then I shall never be made for married life.
You've never yearned to love and be loved?
Really loved.
As a child, yes.
From an early age,
I observed those who claimed to be in love,
but I soon realized, they merely put on a show of appearances,
in order to convince the world, and thereby themselves.
I only believe in friendship.
Love, coupled with flesh, grows as fragile, and bruises easily.
Madame, how can you care for love, if you've never seen anything like it?
Know that I've witnessed love, at its most genuine.
My aunt and uncle, who raised me, lived in such harmony together
that it seemed two people became one and the same person.
From my tenderest age, without even realizing it,
their perfection nurtured my soul.
Why, nurtured by their example,
have you had so many affairs without consequence?
Because...
with each encounter, I thought I recognized,
if only for an instant, a glimmer of this ideal.
An ideal which I have never given up on,
which will impoverish my life until it is realized.
-Must I feel sorry for you? -Oh, no.
I have every hope...
and it grows with each day beside you.
I give you hope?
How amusing you are, marquis. You are told one thing, you hear another.
Though I do not tire of studying you, and your lively imagination,
I tire of repeating myself to drive this obsession from your mind.
Not my mind, madame.
My heart.
Who knows where the heart hides?
Yours is so filled with wit, one may miss it.
Madame, before your men set the chairs down,
please, take one last look at this view,
where nature expresses itself, free from us,
left entirely to its own devices.
Put that chair just over there.
Look.
Do we not imagine someone sitting there, musing?
Do we not sense these meditations taking on nature's colors?
We no longer behold nature, but man's encounter with it.
Marquis, you have struck home.
But why did you ask to bring two chairs, when one sufficed?
Because my demonstration is not finished.
Put that one over there.
Don't these two chairs make us imagine two people,
sitting silently, side by side,
their souls united before nature,
joined by a bond as sacred as the imperturbable serenity of nature?
I crossed paths with the marquis.
Will he be staying much longer?
I don't know.
He hasn't left the château for four months.
Not one dinner or supper without his company.
Several times, his business has called him away
to Paris or elsewhere,
but each time he's chosen to stay here,
never complaining about the sums his absence costs him.
And I suppose, madame, he continues to court you with the greatest attention,
to prove his love for you.
Yes.
He's so proud, he won't return to Paris, without having conquered his prey.
You're pensive.
Need I fear some of his flattery has hit home?
Is your friend wrong?
Please, let us change the topic.
Did I come from Paris for us to keep secrets?
Remember, our friendship is marked
by the candor and liberty of our conversations.
Has this man broken the bond we've shared since childhood?
No, dear, but I know what you think of the marquis.
If I confide in you, I'm afraid it will upset you.
You know how much your opinion matters to me.
Am I to understand you've given in to the marquis?
No, I've given in to no one, believe me.
I believe you.
But then... whence comes this turmoil?
My dear,
the marquis you knew in Paris is not the same man
that has been here the past few months.
A man can change. I've witnessed it, day after day.
A man like him would assume any disguise to reach his ends.
You know me best of all. Do you think I'm that naive?
Madame, how peculiar to offer me something on the day of my birth.
It's quite the fashion in England.
I don't imagine it will catch on here, but I'm flattered by the thought.
Thank you, madame.
Dear marquis, it's been nearly six months
since you retreated from society, neglecting your affairs.
Today, as you turn a year older,
are you not inclined to consider time more closely,
and what madness it has been to stay here so long?
It is the life I led up until this moment which I now consider as madness.
Your face awakened my reason, your company strengthened it.
Marquis, I've known you more adept at flattery.
Sincerity is often clumsy.
It doesn't take the paths...
of seduction.
It is vulnerable and innocent,
struggling to carry, like a child, what is purest in us.
One day, you will miss society.
Crowds tire me.
And solitude, as well.
I have found my society,
the most perfect society, formed by a man and woman in love.
Provided you find a woman who loves you.
Well, I allow myself to hope, madame.
What's this hope based on?
The proof you give me each day.
I give you proof?
Of course. Each day, your company fortifies my feelings.
With all that fortification, they'll become rock-hard.
-You mock me. -I'm sorry.
No, I...
It may seem idiotic, but I love to see you smile.
Do you still dream of me giving myself to you?
More than ever.
And how, with such fervent impatience, do you manage to remain so patient?
I train my patience to be commensurate with my impatience.
I must congratulate you on your self-restraint,
and for never stealing a kiss.
I would so fear offending you,
and losing the pleasure of your company forever.
A highly reasonable reasoning for such an impassioned man.
You find me too reasonable?
Did I say you were too much so?
No, but...
But...?
Do you mean...?
I shall say no more.
My friend.
Hello, madame.
Hello, marquis.
Madame, I know you are friends with the marquise.
I do not wish that my presence should stop you
from speaking freely,
so, allow me to deprive myself of your company.
Thank you, marquis, for your attention.
It may make me regret your absence.
I wouldn't want to encumber you with regrets.
I am off for a stroll.
But nature will be but an echo of your grace.
Know that my natural inclination for distrust has gone.
It was a guide, which let me distinguish true from false.
Now it's brought me to my destination, I am freed.
Oh, my friend, what passion.
Not all passions are alike.
Ours is intense without being excessive.
Our sentiments are as filled with tenderness as with reason.
Tell me, what's the news from Paris?
No news that could affect your remote and serene life.
I'm sure if all of Paris talked of you and the marquis, you wouldn't care.
You're right. Is it the case?
-Do you really want to know? -Yes, amuse me, my dear.
Now that your union is known, everyone is amusing themselves
with betting on the number of days you have left with the Marquis.
Love is an insult for those who have none.
Are they only talking about us?
Oh, I can tell you a sad story.
Do tell.
I don't want my happiness to hide the world's ills from my soul.
Do you remember Madame de Joncquières?
Many years ago, she lived not far from me.
The daughter of a baron and a countess,
but conceived out of wedlock, she had no position to claim.
She was seduced by a duke,
and thought her marriage to him would save her.
But he deceived her with a fake marriage.
She gave birth to a daughter, the fruit of their union.
She took the duke to trial,
but having less influence than the man who betrayed her,
she lost and was ruined.
Ever since, we've had no news of her.
I remember.
Do you tell me this as a reminder of the treachery of certain men?
Oh, no, madame.
I tell you this because one of my servants recognized her.
Where is she now?
In a place so sordid, you would have trouble picturing it.
A sort of vice den,
where men gather to play and have supper.
Usually one or two of the guests stay,
and spend the night with madame, or her daughter, as they please.
How old is her daughter?
Fifteen or 16, perhaps.
Apparently the girl's beauty is infinitely delicate and refined, yet...
lost among such baseness, no one recognizes it.
How much crueler it seems
when misfortune befalls those who've known our condition.
For my part, I believe language is correct
to put "happiness" just a pin drop away from "hapless."
Madame, you are wrong.
Happiness that doesn't last is called pleasure.
Soon we'll have to cut the trees around it,
so, their shade doesn't hinder its growth.
To think this tree will outlive us,
and perhaps will be the only remaining witness of our union.
You're not listening. Your thoughts are elsewhere.
I'm sorry, madame. My thoughts prevented me from hearing you.
What are these thoughts that have distanced me from you?
I fear they'll displease you, as much as me.
Let us be displeased together. We can console each other.
Well...
Business calls me to Paris.
Can't you send a delegate?
Unfortunately not this time.
If the amount wasn't substantial, I would forget it.
My dear marquis, don't be upset.
Go to Paris. Settle the matter as quickly as possible.
You consent to me leaving you here for a few days?
What are a few days compared to the time we have left together?
And do you need my permission?
Do you feel bound by some authority I might wield over you?
I could complain.
You are so right, madame, and when I leave you,
I shall delight in the thought of seeing you again.
You still haven't told me about your trip.
You haven't given me a chance, madame.
Oh, forgive me. I'll give you your chance. I'm listening.
I thought of you.
And when you weren't thinking of me?
I thought of your legs.
Marquis...
When you weren't thinking of my legs?
I thought of your back.
-My back? -Yes. I love it so.
Be serious. Tell me.
I thought of your navel.
Be quiet. There must've been more during your trip.
Yes.
A thousand building ideas.
Building?
The marquis isn't with you?
He's in Rouen.
With his new taste for business, he travels a lot.
I know what you're thinking.
I do not doubt his fidelity. His mind is full of his undertakings.
He inherited a large sum.
Not sure what else to do with the money, he decided to build townhouses
to leave for posterity.
You're not worried?
Oh, not at all.
You may detect a touch of fatigue.
My health has been somewhat fragile lately.
The marquis' trips and occupations don't upset you?
Not in the least.
Am I to understand that you and the marquis still get along,
as perfectly as ever?
Absolutely.
Nothing, even time,
has altered the plenitude of your feelings?
Nothing. Each day, they grow stronger and fuller.
Forgive me, then, my suspicions.
It could be, my dear friend,
that I'm beginning to envy you.
Envy me?
Must I wish upon you what happened to me?
Unfortunately, my overcautious nature won't allow it.
My stubbornness won't let me surrender, and prompts me to lecture others.
But what can I teach, when I myself have tasted nothing?
Men have grasped this. Not a single one courts me.
I have protected myself so thoroughly that nothing could ever happen to me.
Oh, my dear...
My pride would let you believe that nothing has changed
between the marquis and I.
But our friendship is too sincere. I can hide my upset no longer.
Two years ago,
you said the marquis would leave me for one day, then two,
that little by little,
his business would call him away more frequently,
that little by little, he'd return without a word,
settle into his chair, talk to his dog,
and drift off.
I fear your predictions were right.
Tell me what's happened.
The more passionate we are,
the more we exaggerate the slightest thing.
You know the architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux?
Yes.
He was to stay with us one month. In the end, he stayed three.
He was to work on some of the marquis' projects.
His presence would make it easier to discuss certain important matters.
At first, we'd lunch with Mr. Ledoux.
In the afternoon,
the marquis would spend a while talking with him.
But before long, we were having all our meals together.
I was excluded from the conversation without their realizing it,
their passion for their projects was so great.
From morn till night, the marquis was at the architect's side.
Their friendship was so intense that I ceased to exist.
When Mr. Ledoux left,
I thought the marquis would be less distant, but alas.
He lost himself in countless letters, books,
and heaven knows what deep thoughts...
that my caresses no longer affect him.
He only addresses me to ask my permission to take his leave
to deal with cornices, chimneys, windows, or tiles.
My dear, you are wrong to be alarmed.
You can trust my experience.
What you describe is but the fate of all unions.
No one escapes it.
I fear that passion cannot last.
They were no ordinary feelings the marquis vowed to love me with.
I couldn't bear it, if it is so.
Pull yourself together, madame. Your fear is unjustified.
The marquis is not courting another woman.
Before you torment yourself, find a way to sound out his feelings.
I'm sure you will be reassured. No?
Dreaming, my friend?
You are dreaming, too, marquise.
It's true, and rather sadly.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I don't believe you, madame.
Come.
Tell me.
Do you become bored, when away from your business?
No, but there are days...
When one is bored.
You are mistaken.
Really, you are very much mistaken.
It's just one of those days, when one is bored.
My friend...
For some time now, I've wanted to say something,
but I fear it will distress you.
You? Distress me?
Perhaps.
Heaven is witness to my innocence.
It happened unbeknownst to me, by a curse,
to which the entire human race is apparently subject to,
since I myself have not escaped it.
It comes from you?
You frighten me, madame. What is it?
Marquis, it's...
Oh, I'm sorry, it will sadden you.
All things considered, I'd best keep quiet.
No, madame, speak.
Do you have a secret in your heart?
Isn't our first rule to bare our souls to each other without reserve?
Haven't you noticed my cheer has gone?
I've lost my appetite. I eat and drink out of necessity.
I can't sleep.
At night, I wonder, I ask myself, "Is the marquis less lovable? No.
Do you have any complaints? No.
Are there any suspected liaisons? No.
Has his tenderness for you diminished? No.
Why, when your friend is the same, has your heart changed?
For it has.
You cannot deny it.
You don't await him with the same impatience.
You don't have the same pleasure at seeing him.
The concern when he was slow to return,
the sweet emotion at the sound of his carriage,
when he appeared, when they announced his arrival...
You no longer feel it."
-What, madame? -My dear marquis,
you are the same, but your friend cannot deny...
that love has gone.
It's a horrible discovery, but no less real.
Madame, you...
You are an extraordinary woman, a unique woman,
a woman like none other.
Your frankness and honesty disconcert me.
I should die of shame.
How great I see you, how small I see myself.
You spoke first, whereas I was guilty first.
Your sincerity inspires me.
I'd be a monster if I didn't admit
that the story of your heart is also mine, word for word.
Everything you said, I thought.
Yet I said nothing.
I suffered.
I don't know when I might have the courage to speak.
-Is that true, my friend? -Nothing could be truer.
Let us congratulate ourselves
at having both lost this fragile, deceptive sentiment which united us.
How unfortunate it would be if my love had endured
while yours had ceased.
Oh, madame, madame,
you have never seemed so beautiful and charming as right now.
And if past experience hadn't made me more cautious,
I would think I loved you more than ever.
Marquis, what is to become of us?
Madame, we'll continue to see each other,
and enjoy the confidence of the most tender friendship.
We shall be spared all the worries and troubles...
Please, excuse my attire, and my discomfort.
If your servant hadn't insisted,
I wouldn't have presented myself, marquise.
My unhappy fate is such that I've found means
to live away from people of your quality, as I consider myself...
unworthy of your gaze.
I won't bore you with the tale of my woes.
You aren't boring me.
I'm listening, madame.
You may be aware that I was born of a union that should never have been.
My mother was Countess de Demontoy, and my father, Baron Obolensky.
I grew up without parents, but was given the finest education.
I was very young
when the Duke of Grimaud asked for my hand in marriage.
I thought I was saved.
But he fooled me with a false ceremony.
I found myself with a child and no husband.
My error was to demand justice, and put what little I had toward this end.
But as the man who betrayed me had more influence than me,
I lost my case.
Necessity knows no law. My daughter and I had to live.
We find ourselves in the class of contemptible women.
Where is she? Didn't she accompany you, as I had asked?
Come here, mademoiselle, come here.
Please, sit here.
Sorry.
Sit over there.
Stand up and come to me.
You have beautiful hair.
Thank you, madame.
Could you lift it up?
Yes, madame.
Your neck is even more admirable.
Thank you, madame.
Madame, I'm surprised such a graceful, delicate creature could find
no better home than the one you currently find yourself in.
I took her around during and after my trial,
among magistrates, prelates, dignitaries, and financiers.
They toyed with her for a while, then left her.
It is not her angelic beauty or her refined nature.
She is grace itself, but...
she has nothing of the libertine,
and no talent for stirring the languor of blasé men.
Would you describe her as an honest woman?
Our profession aside,
the most honest.
I admit, for a few months, your life will be austere,
but it won't last forever, and I promise you the finest reward.
Talk it over.
If my demands are beyond you, tell me.
I shall not be offended or surprised.
Madame, we are so flattered by your trust
that each of your demands is an opportunity
for us to thank you.
Those clothes do suit you.
To give you time to adjust to your new life,
we'll meet again in a few months.
What a lovely day. Everything is so sweet.
The air, the wine we drank,
the tender sunshine, and your company, of course.
You say "of course," as if you were just being polite.
Not at all. You are mistaken, marquise.
I imagine you would have preferred sweeter company than mine
to round out your tableau,
like Madame de Bailly's.
I no longer see Madame de Bailly.
Oh, forgive me.
I'd forgotten that relationship was already two weeks old.
Last time, you mentioned a young Italian countess.
-I told you about the contessa? -Yes.
Have her charms lost their effects?
Yes. As soon as she gave herself to me.
It was very embarrassing, I assure you.
I can imagine.
Oh, I'm sorry, my poor marquis. You're all alone with an old friend.
Don't be sorry.
What is sweeter than friendship and more perfect than ours?
There is no turmoil between us. Our hearts are open.
We needn't force ourselves to hide anything.
-Do you wish to sit? -No, let's continue.
Where were we?
I was praising our friendship. But it seems only I enjoy it.
Oh, Marquis, stop asking for tokens. Am I not here with you?
What would you say to an opera or comedy this afternoon?
It seems to me, there is nothing we have not seen.
Why shut ourselves away on such a perfect day?
If I'm not mistaken...
I think it is them. Yes, that is them.
Madame, do you recognize me?
Is it you, madame?
Yes, it's me. How are you? What has become of you?
-It's been an eternity. -Haven't you heard of our misfortune?
We were forced us to live in a way that suited our small means.
You didn't give me any news. I could be offended.
An inconvenience of poverty is the distrust it inspires.
How the young lady has grown.
How it ages me.
When she came to Paris, she was knee-high to a grasshopper.
But you haven't changed, madame.
Time seems to have ignored you.
I don't believe that, but you are kind, as ever.
Let's walk and talk.
Oh, sorry, this is the Marquis des Arcis, my friend.
His presence won't bother us.
Madame,
I understand how one can bear poverty, as a multitude of men and women do.
But to pass from opulence to necessity, like you, to have to settle for it,
and find bliss in it...
Today I have no regrets.
A life devoted to piety seems less restrictive than one of gallantry.
I believe you, more than you can imagine.
If you knew how much I respect your conduct.
Don't have too much respect for us, Madame.
Faith rewards us, well beyond anything you can imagine.
Our life is not a sacrifice, as many think,
but a blessing.
Excuse us, madame, we must leave you.
So abruptly?
We must go to church. We can stay no longer.
Go. I should hate myself if I made you late.
So, Marquis? What would you like to do?
No show today? Are you sure?
Who are those women?
I knew the mother long ago.
She married a gambler, he lost their fortune, then died.
She found herself alone with her young daughter.
Poverty and shame drove her from our society.
But she seems to feel no regret.
Libertines scoff, but religion is a good thing.
Yes. Especially for the unfortunate.
It restores the lost prestige of this mother and her daughter.
Isn't that the Duke de Beauregard and his wife?
We must greet them.
Come.
-Marquise. -Yes.
-There's something I don't understand. -May I be of help?
With such a face as hers, in our society, one could have anything one desires.
You're speaking of...?
Your friend's daughter.
Is her face that beautiful?
I could only see the child from so long ago.
She has the face of one of Raphael's Madonnas.
Why, with such a face,
should she not aim for a better position in society?
Is it not cruel of a mother to impose this fate upon her child?
Modesty of means may be preferable to shameful wealth.
What is it?
I know you, marquis. I know you.
Oh, no, madame, no.
If you believe I'm aroused by that pious girl,
you don't know me at all.
I don't believe anything,
I was amusing myself with the thought that religion could tempt you.
But no matter,
as you will soon forget all about her in one or two weeks...
like that little Italian countess.
Ladies.
Morning, madame.
It's early for you. Couldn't you sleep?
I can't sleep anymore.
Is something worrying you?
Your friends' lot.
-Does that still trouble you? -I have so little to think about
that the slightest subject worries me at the moment.
And your building projects?
They're just fine without me worrying about them.
-Madame, have you seen them again? -Who?
Your friends.
-No. -That's not right.
You're rich, they're in need.
You could at least invite them for the occasional meal.
I invited them ten times, to no avail.
They refuse to come to my home.
Frequenting our society does not suit their simplicity.
Opulence invites sin.
-There's nothing we can do to help them? -Do they need our help?
Is religion not a succor and a treasure?
It is they who fret over our fate, and pray for our salvation.
If I sent them 20 Louis, do you think they'd refuse?
I'm sure of it.
Why accept from you what they refuse from me?
What reason do they have to refuse a friend's goodwill?
Marquis, we of the world cannot hope to understand
the scrupulous sensitivities of pious souls.
So, there's nothing I can do to help them?
No, marquis, nothing.
Now that is cruel.
Yes, cruel is the word.
Oh, no.
Oh, marquise.
A girl I've seen only once...
And whom you won't see again.
Madame,
since you are my friend,
I must confide something. I concealed an event from you.
An event?
In the King's Garden,
while you talked to her mother, I walked alongside her, remember?
You can imagine that I couldn't help myself from staring at her.
With each attempt, she turned away, and looked down.
But at one point...
your conversation was concluding when...
she finally met my gaze. And...
What an enlightenment, madame.
Her gaze...
so modest, sincere...
a profound gaze,
free from coquetry and convention.
A gaze...
full of a truth that speaks to you,
though you cannot decipher it.
You saw all that?
How long did she look at you?
I couldn't say.
Perhaps not...
a full second, but...
the longest second one could conceive of,
an infinite second, as it still resonates within me.
Marquis.
Your imagination never ceases to amaze me.
A young woman, embarrassed by your insistence,
glances up, and you fabricate extraordinary dreams.
You, the man of reason,
the Epicurean, who believes we are but a mass of atoms.
That's what my reason keeps telling me, madame.
Yet never has a gaze seemed so true.
Your "nevers" last no longer than your "always."
I of all people know that.
Maybe your collection lacks a pious woman.
You must be right.
You must be right.
And yet...
Marquis, be on your guard.
Do not confuse this girl with those you've known.
She cannot be tempted, seduced, or approached.
You cannot prevail.
Trust me,
if you want to spare yourself suffering, forget that girl.
My friend.
What madness.
At any rate, your plan is ill-founded.
Why is that?
Why would the marquis grow attached to this girl in particular,
and not another?
Because the marquis cannot resist what resists him.
If I inspired lofty sentiments, they were proportional to my resistance.
Haven't you observed that love grows when the object of desire escapes us?
You seem quite sure of yourself.
What if I told you that the marquis visits each day
to nonchalantly inquire about any news I might have
about the girl and her mother?
I'll admit, I didn't expect the marquis to be such easy prey.
Nevertheless, I fear that...
your endeavor is excessive.
My endeavor falls short of my pain, and the blow the marquis dealt me.
Be fair.
Were you not aware of his inconstant nature?
Why be cross with a dishonest man,
if nature has made him that way?
Would it be fair to allow dishonesty to roam at leisure?
My anger is filled with a sense of justice.
I don't seek revenge.
In me, I see the female gender,
and in him, the male.
To do justice, our heart
must be pure, and free from resentment.
Madame...
purity is what drives me.
If no just souls attempt to improve men,
how can we hope for a better society?
It seems uncharitable to hope for others' suffering.
Open your eyes, my friend, to the human race.
Only pain helps the spirit recognize its errors.
Is it thus out of goodness
that you want to make him suffer?
Yes.
I want to enlighten his mind.
Madame, if you will...
What's wrong?
Tell me, talk to me.
Is it a woman?
I can tell it's a woman.
You love her and she doesn't love you?
Love affairs are always like that.
One always loves too much, and the other, not enough.
My father said nature dislikes equality and enjoys making us fret.
One always has more and the other, less. In every realm and matter.
Even pleasure.
Let's play a game.
Close your eyes and think about her.
Imagine that you're with her,
that... I'm her.
-Come, marquis, make an effort. -No, no, sorry, this won't work,
I can't imagine doing that with her.
It would be an insult to her purity and modesty.
A saintly woman in bed with a man is still a woman.
Oh, not her.
Hello, marquis.
You seem to be doing better than yesterday.
I was afraid you were taking ill.
Look at this little painting. It would go well in your home. No?
Aren't those little sheep charming?
No, marquis, I have no news.
Madame, do you think I might have her portrait?
What an idea. I think you need to rest some more.
I only glimpsed her face once,
and a perfect, albeit vague, image of it
has been engraved upon my mind.
This vagueness is the cause of all my torment, madame.
Possessing a faithful portrait
might cure the excesses of my imagination.
I might even find some imperfections to console me
for being unable to see her again.
You are dreaming, marquis.
How could she offer her face to a painter, when she takes such care to hide it?
It's absurd that religion drives nature's gems
to hide in the shadows. Has one ever seen anything so brutish.
Mind what you say. Some might take offense for a lot less.
I don't care about those who live in the hope of dying well.
Monsieur, are you sure that you are in a fit state to lecture
and proudly speak for libertines?
You've dragged about for weeks, like a sick dog.
I've done everything to forget her.
I tried everything.
The more I tried, the more I remembered.
Madame, grant me one favor.
-What favor? -Take pity on me.
I want to see her again.
It's a difficult matter.
No, marquis, I fear I'd lose their friendship by helping you.
Oh, no.
Do not abandon me.
I won't be accountable for my actions. I know myself.
These women are dear to you. Spare them the madness I'm capable of.
I'll find them.
I'll send 10, 20, 100 men to find them, but I will find them.
I'll force my way in. I don't know what I'll say or do.
Beware of the violent state I'm in.
You're right.
It's not for you I shall take action, but for them.
I hope at least, Most Honorable Marquis, that you will give me time.
As little as I can, madame.
As little as I can.
Thank you.
Thank you, my friend.
Ladies. Oh, please, stay seated. Eat.
Drink some more wine to console yourselves for all the deprivations
that this penitent's life imposes upon you.
Make the most of the marquis' absence.
I wouldn't be surprised if his impatience made him arrive early.
I can't wait to see the scene he'll put on for us.
In any case, I'm certain I'll appreciate yours, ladies.
My daughter and I have been preparing for several days.
Rest assured that we will do our best.
These clothes suit you so well
that it's hard to imagine you, just a short time ago...
Ladies, the marquis' carriage is approaching.
The Marquis des Arcis asked me to announce his arrival.
He's here. Show him in.
I told him to be surprised to find you here,
and to make polite excuses before accepting my invitation
to join us for dinner.
Let's see how good an actor he is. Do eat.
Marquis.
You, here?
I didn't know you were dining. I'm not dressed appropriately.
I was visiting a friend who wishes to part with his estate not far from here,
and on the way back to Paris I thought that if you found out I had passed by
without greeting you, you'd scold me.
You did well, marquis. You are more than welcome.
Do you know Madame de Joncquières and her daughter?
Oh, have you forgotten?
We met them on a walk in the King's Garden.
No, I remember.
Ladies, I do not wish to interrupt you any longer.
Allow me to retire.
Are you leaving, marquis?
I do not wish to be importunate, madame.
What if I was vexed to see you leave so soon?
Madame, vexing you is the last thing I wish to do.
Before your interruption,
we were talking about these libertine philosophers.
Your timing seems to be perfect.
Why me?
Yes.
You've studied them, haven't you?
No.
-Don't be modest. -Madame.
No, I-- You...
You are mistaken.
Didn't you study them to denounce them better?
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Of course, well...
A little.
Then, marquis, tell us why you think they're so awful.
Know that all of us here think the same as you.
But I...
-I don't... -We were saying that many libertines agree
their philosophy has an advantage over religion
in making man happier. What do you say to that?
Well...
-We're listening. -Yes. So...
Pleasure-- The quest for pleasure...
is the source of all our misfortunes.
Libertines are children.
They think merely of instant gratification.
But for a moment of pleasure,
how many tears and cries?
What a fine image. Isn't it, madame?
Yes, and very true.
Pleasure calls for pleasure. These men are eternally unsatisfied.
And eternally fickle, no?
And eternally sad.
Eternally distraught with their desire? Right?
Indeed.
Monsieur, allow me a question.
Just yesterday my daughter asked if the search for the sublime
was a passion to be fought.
I didn't know what to say.
Mademoiselle...
everything sublime depends on our Creator.
The sublime is not a passion, it is an emotion.
An emotion which crosses our soul, and which, in an instant,
for a dizzy moment,
transports us to absolute truth.
You hear all the subtleties of divine love,
as if your only food had been the Scriptures.
Weren't you tempted to join holy orders?
Forgive me, madame.
I had forewarned that this dinner would be brief,
our days are so ordered.
Don't worry, you did warn me.
I would regret if you were to neglect your duty because of me.
But first, madame, I want to give you this text I told you about earlier.
Come with me.
Mademoiselle...
I hope I answered your questions.
Yes, monsieur.
You know, souls who are interested in the sublime
are the finest.
Mademoiselle.
Your mother is waiting for you.
Goodbye, madame.
Goodbye, monsieur.
Goodbye, mademoiselle.
What a wonderful child.
Yes, I agree.
-How was I? -You were perfect, marquis,
I was delighted and almost convinced by your arguments.
Why did they leave so soon? Couldn't you have made them stay a while?
Well, criticism is my only reward.
What woman in Paris would do as much?
Oh, sorry, madame. There is not another like you.
You're my only true friend in this world. I'm a monster of ingratitude.
What is the state of your heart?
I must have that girl,
or I will perish.
My friend, I advise you to drive out that thought.
Ladies, we've met before, haven't we?
Yes, we dined together at Madame de La Pommeraye's.
I say, ladies.
What a happy coincidence.
We left it sealed, so you could read it first.
The priest gave it to you?
Yes, madame.
He gave it to her after confession,
requesting she open it in secret.
How did this man of God justify his gesture?
He said her charms are one of the most dangerous gifts
God can give a woman,
no man would be left indifferent to them,
and men will all try to lead her into temptation.
Then he said only an honest man could protect her.
What a rogue. And what did you say?
I remained silent, madame.
He added that the Lord watched over her,
as a gentleman known to him, with the finest of souls,
had noticed her, and been moved by her gracious devotion.
Dear marquis, that is how you finance the Church.
Good. Very good. I'm pleased.
Keep going to church. If the priest asks you for an answer,
say that you gave the letter to your mother,
who burnt it in front of you.
What an imbecile I was. I'm desperate, madame.
I beg you. I need you.
Advise me. How do I approach and talk to them without offending them?
Rest assured, I'll do nothing without your consent.
Marquis, there's nothing more to do.
You won't have that girl. It's all over.
Madame, forgive me, for coming here in this way.
But I knew no other way to speak to you.
I can imagine how embarrassed my letter to your daughter made you, but...
please, believe me when I say it was inspired by the most sincere
and most honest feelings.
Know that my intention is to offer your daughter
the finest surroundings.
I wish to keep her pure soul safe
from this world full of cruelty and vice, madame.
No other face ever inspired such goodness in me.
Madame, here is a letter of guarantee,
which entitles you to an income of 600 Louis.
You may dispose of it as you wish.
If not for your comfort, which you despise,
you may spend it on the unfortunates, for whom you pray so much.
Mademoiselle...
for you, here are some diamonds, chosen for their purity...
as a token of the purity of my affection.
Goodbye, ladies.
My life is in your hands.
Madame, don't you think we should accept?
Are you inclined to accept?
Yes, Madame, with your permission.
No. We're not there yet.
What more can we hope for?
It's a lot for women like us.
No, it's not enough.
This income would ensure our happiness, Madame.
Well, I say it's not sufficient.
I fear it is risky to hope for more.
Sit down.
Take this pen and paper,
and write a reply to him, full of pride and indignation.
I will give it to him.
Say nothing.
I'm just too kind, marquis.
You're plotting behind my back, and I should keep quiet?
If you'd seen how offended those poor ladies were by your gesture.
I introduced you as...
my friend, and the most honest of men.
I felt so ashamed.
Forgive me, madame.
Madame. Do forgive me, I beg you.
As this girl is beautiful and virtuous, must you become her persecutor?
How did I deserve to become your accomplice?
Come, marquis, throw yourself at my feet, beg for forgiveness,
and promise to leave my sad friends in peace.
Forgive me, madame. A thousand pardons.
Help me, I beg you.
Love is a curse. It changes our nature.
I must have that girl. I must have her.
Look at what I have become.
Have pity, please. Help your friend.
I already told you. Nothing can be done. Forget her.
Here are the deeds to two houses,
and an income three times greater than the previous one.
Well, madame?
What do you think?
Madame, can you not tell me something which lets me hope, or despair?
Madame, is it too little for you?
When I left you last time,
I told you that my life depended on you.
Maybe I should have specified, it wasn't just about my destiny,
but about my entire health.
May God let me see you again soon.
Stop those tears. Write, madame.
I beg you, madame, I beg you.
He's sacrificing half his fortune. Isn't that enough?
Only a prince could be as generous.
The offer is too much for you, too little for me.
Just write.
Have mercy, madame, please.
Start writing, madame. You will be rewarded, I assure you.
Marquise, you've driven this man crazy.
You can congratulate yourself on your vengeance.
Congratulate myself now?
When my goal is so close?
Why? Haven't you achieved it yet?
No.
You're being very mysterious.
Do you seek to persuade him to give away more of his fortune?
Do you seek to ruin him?
What more do you want?
I don't know what you have in mind, but you seem sure of yourself.
Be careful.
Savor this victory over the marquis, and don't ask for more, trust me.
How many kings have perished from too much assurance?
Madame, I'm already dead.
What more is there to fear?
Marquis.
You're already back from your lands.
Didn't you intend to stay a year?
Do solitude and books bore you?
Madame, the three weeks there were like three years.
I'm not happy anywhere.
I've decided to commit the greatest folly for a man of my age and rank.
Madame, I shall wed.
Marquis. The matter is serious, and calls for careful thought.
I have but one tenacious thought. I can't be more unhappy than I am now.
You could be wrong.
This is why I'd like you...
to negotiate on my behalf, madame.
Go and see the mother and daughter, question the mother,
sound out the girl's heart, and tell me what their intentions are.
Tread carefully, marquis.
You're engaging your fortune and reputation.
There's no going back.
Think of the mockery of those close to you
and those who won't understand why you're marrying an impecunious girl.
Know that you'll never be able to promise to wed any other woman,
as you so often did.
Bear in mind, this young woman's charms will fade.
You don't know what her true character is, and yet you will have to suffer it
for the rest of your life.
Madame, I've been over it in my mind, time and time again.
You are a good friend
to want to rip this unfortunate passion from my heart.
But to do that, you'd have to rip out my heart.
Thank you, madame, thank you.
Congratulations, mademoiselle.
Madame was right.
Our patience has been rewarded a thousand times over. My child.
The marquis wishes to marry you.
Why this look, my child?
Rejoice with me.
What's worrying you?
Not only are we gaining a fortune, but also a name.
Mother.
There was never any question of marriage.
I thought Madame just wanted
to make the marquis pay for his fickleness.
Madame loves us.
Her goodness to you has overcome her resentment for the marquis.
Forgive me.
You want me to be grateful to her, but I can't.
-I don't like that woman. -How dare you say that?
Wasn't Madame touched by our misfortune? Has she not been good to us?
But aren't we good to her?
My girl, don't forget where we come from.
I haven't forgotten.
But at least there our clients weren't fooled about what we were.
Madame devised this marriage for your own good.
What good do you see in marrying a man we're deceiving?
You'll secure an honorable position.
Is it honorable to betray a sacrament, and spend one's life lying to a man?
Forget the sacrament.
Every marriage is an arrangement,
and there's nothing wrong with that.
It will restore your dignity, your freedom.
What dignity in pretending to love?
Arrangements give rise, over time, to feelings.
Your heart may grow fonder.
If I grew fond of the marquis,
my destiny would only be all the more painful.
Why do you say that?
If it's cruel to deceive an innocent man,
it's all the worse to deceive a man whom you love.
Can one love someone and lie to him?
Mother...
if only the marquis knew who we were...
He might kill us.
Madame.
You've said nothing all day. You seem so far away.
Forgive me, monsieur.
Did you like the ceremony?
Yes, monsieur.
You look pale. Are you well?
Yes, monsieur.
I'll let you go back to your rooms.
Send for me whenever you wish.
Wait.
May I see you smile?
Thank you.
Please, leave me with my daughter.
One last precaution, my girl. I brought you this.
Don't forget that the marquis thinks you're pure.
Feign innocence as much as you can, and take this,
so, he has no suspicions, concerning your virginity.
Put some on the sheets.
My girl...
I don't understand.
Haven't you been through far greater trials than this?
No, Mother.
I've never known anything worse.
I think...
the Lord is punishing me for playing his devoted servant.
Keep your voice down.
Leave the Lord out of this.
He doesn't bother to come to our rescue when we implore him.
Why would he concern himself with punishing us?
What are you afraid of?
I thought the marquis wasn't detestable to you.
I suffer from finding myself detestable.
Pull yourself together.
And listen to me.
I don't glory in all these arrangements, but put aside this disgust of lies,
and deceit.
The world is built on lies.
It's how it was made. We must make the best of it.
Generations of men and women have managed before us.
You'll manage, too.
I'm sure of it.
Madame...
from one day to the next, you suddenly find yourself
in the house and bed of a man who is still a stranger to you.
Don't worry.
The purity you have preserved won't be taken from you.
Not before you feel the same
sweet inclination as myself, which transports two lovers in pleasure.
I will not do anything, madame, to force your sensibility, nothing.
Get to know me.
Hello, my dear friend.
You are very cheerful, marquis.
My modesty forbids me from asking the cause.
No, you are wrong.
Is it the effect of her delicacy, or her noble soul?
I refused to be the vulgar husband, eager to enjoy his rights.
You are mocking me.
On the contrary. I'm rejoicing.
It would seem that purity is contagious.
Or there's a delight in delaying one's satisfaction.
Yes, indeed.
One's satisfaction is often equal to one's patience.
You haven't forgotten that I've come to take you and your little family away.
No, I was expecting you. I found it such a sweet idea.
I can't wait to be in the King's Garden. That is where you're taking us?
Yes. That's where I'll give you my wedding present.
I'm proud to remember
that you met your wife in that very garden.
My wife.
That word still seems very strange and new.
You will get used to it.
Why don't you get married?
To whom?
And who will swear fidelity to me?
It seems one can do without a husband's fidelity.
Yes, but if mine were unfaithful,
I may be strange enough to take exception to it.
And I'm vindictive.
You would get revenge, naturally.
Anyway, we could get a mansion together.
The four of us would be the most pleasant company.
That sounds wonderful, but I'm not getting married.
The only man I might have been tempted to marry is...
Me?
I can admit it to you now, without any fear.
Why didn't you tell me?
It appears I did well not to.
The one you married suits you better in every way.
My dear wife.
You haven't forgotten that the marquise has a surprise for us?
She's taking us for a walk down memory lane.
Well, let's go.
Well, marquise,
I found the ceremony yesterday was very beautiful,
and a great success.
There was a blend of simplicity, grace, and gravity,
which gave it a very special glow.
Did you feel it from where you were sitting?
Yes, marquis.
You can be proud of the ceremony. It made a great impression.
I hope you'll remember it for a long time.
No doubt about it.
Which way is your coachman going to get to the King's Garden?
Don't worry, he knows shortcuts.
Without wishing to vex you, I assure you, your coachman misheard you.
He heard me very well.
Be patient, we're almost there.
There.
We have arrived.
Madame, what joke is this?
What are you playing at? Why are we in front of this hovel?
What's wrong?
Why the long faces? What's wrong?
-Madame. -Yes?
Ladies, you get out first.
-Please, Madame. -Out, you two.
Madame, what tone is that to use to my family?
The tone that is suitable for such women.
It's time to get out, ladies.
Go on.
What is the meaning of all this?
To see where your wife and mother-in-law plied their trade
for several years, as Madame and Mademoiselle d'Aisnon.
Madame, I do not understand. Explain yourself.
Your family can explain perfectly well themselves.
Madame?
Madame?
Did the marquise speak the truth?
-Do you know this vice den? -No.
Monsieur, let me explain.
My father was the Baron Obolensky,
and my mother was the Countess of Demontoy.
I was to be married to the Duke of Grimaud, but...
I...
Yes, monsieur.
Madame spoke the truth.
My mother and I worked here.
Not you, my wife.
Yes, monsieur.
And what did you do here?
Answer me.
Whoever so wished could spend the night with us.
If you're all playing a trick on me here,
it's most inappropriate, madame.
Inappropriate?
You think so?
You gained an honest woman,
and you tired of her.
That woman was me.
Out of charity, I made you marry one worthy of you.
You did all this...?
If other women in my situation had enough self-esteem,
they'd do the same,
and men like you would be less common.
-But, Madame, what about our friendship? -What friendship?
Marquis,
your desires keep you so busy,
you don't know how to see into others' hearts,
You can't see past the veil that modesty imposes upon us.
If a tormented soul smiles at you, you smile back,
without imagining the distress which devours it.
So, it was all an act?
Rest assured, it will amuse all of Paris.
Marquis.
Marquis.
Marquis.
Madame, how dare you come to me?
Monsieur, walk on me, crush me, for I have deserved it,
do anything you will, but listen to me.
Madame, withdraw, or fear for your life.
-Have mercy. Listen. -I wish to hear no more.
-Monsieur, give me a moment... -Madame.
Don't touch me, nor come near me again...
or I won't answer for my actions.
Madame...
Why?
Why did you betray us?
I didn't betray you.
Do not worry. I'll keep my promise. A handsome sum awaits you.
I'm talking about our honor.
My daughter's honor,
you promised you would save.
Isn't it a great honor to have been my accomplices?
You, who were betrayed by a man,
rejoice that you have been part of this plan.
Tell yourself that if all women acted like us,
the honor of being a woman would be greater.
Marquis, I sympathize with you.
I also find it unfair that these women, who are so often honored,
can dishonor you thus.
Don't let it get you down.
Shake off this serious frown, forget what people say,
become your old light-hearted self.
Move out of the way. Out of the way. Out of the way.
Let me into my own home. Let me through.
These men just brought her back.
They fished her out of the Seine. She's still breathing.
What are you waiting for? Get all these people out.
I believe these men are waiting for a reward.
It's a lot to pay for a whore.
I had her for less.
I hope she looked better.
Go on, gentlemen.
Get out.
Out.
I'm hungry. Serve me some food.
What now?
What?
She recovered for an instant, then passed out again almost immediately.
For now, the doctor doesn't know if she'll survive.
Stop.
Something else, please.
No.
Something else.
Go see what that was.
Monsieur, it's Madame.
She ran away while a chambermaid slept.
-You let her get away? -We soon took her back to bed.
-You're sure she wanted to run away? -Certain, monsieur.
Light my study. Tell my wife, I wish to see her immediately.
Come in.
I thought if you had enough strength to run away,
you might still have some left to listen to me.
My honor prevents me from leaving my wife and her mother
with no money or roof over their heads on the streets of Paris.
You may tell your mother,
she will be given a house in Rouen and an income.
Thank you, monsieur. Thank you.
I am not finished.
Come here and sit down.
No, monsieur, I can't.
I'm not worthy...
to come near you, or for you to approach me.
-You said so yourself. -Madame, I regret it.
I don't think you're wicked.
You were led into a vile act, out of weakness and authority.
Didn't you lie and agree to marry through constraint?
Yes, monsieur.
My reason and my principles aren't those of all my contemporaries.
I'm opposed to union without inclination.
I give you back your freedom.
You may keep my name, and live where you wish.
Think it over, and let me know.
Monsieur...
Give me the darkest corner of your house, where you would let your wife reside.
I'll stay there without a murmur.
Madame, you don't understand. You are free.
I'll only be free when you can judge my behavior...
when you can look into my heart, and see how much I hate lies.
I'll be free the day you see how far from me my past faults are.
Madame, I believe you are sincere.
And if my mouth ever uttered...
a single humiliating word...
I am sorry, madame.
Rest assured...
that never more...
will my wife hear another hurtful word.
I can hide from your view forever.
Say the word, I will go.
Your happiness isn't compromised. Just forget me.
Madame, I have forgiven you, I told you.
I see you don't believe me.
Madame.
Madame. Madame.
Madame, I beg you.
Madame, stand up.
Come now, marquise. Come, madame.
Come. Come.
Madame des Arcis.
Wait for me, I'll be right back.
Madame.
-Are you leaving Paris? -Well, madame,
has Madame de La Pommeraye sent you to spy on me?
You must be joking, marquis.
You know I am a friend of the baroness.
There's no need to spy on you.
The rumors are so full of details.
Marquis, you should know me better.
My friendship with Madame de La Pommeraye does not make me her accomplice.
Your misfortune does not delight me in the slightest.
My wife and I are leaving Paris for the country.
We will stay till we can return without any repercussions
for either her or myself.
Fresh scandal chases away the old.
Be patient, marquis. People will forget you.
Thank you, madame.
I nearly forgot.
If you see Madame de La Pommeraye again,
thank her.
Thank her?
By taking revenge, she did me a favor.
-What favor are you talking about? -The best one can do to two people.
I'd be a fool to blame Madame de La Pommeraye's resentment.
Without it, I wouldn't have met my wife.
Oh, I...
I went to see the baroness last week.
Oh, really? How is she?
Very well. Very well.
I haven't seen her in ages.
Is she in the same house?
Oh, yes.
The one opposite the Marquis des Arcis.
That's right.
In fact, I came across him that day.
Who?
Well, the Marquis.
Really?
Did you speak with him?
Maybe I'm being too curious, but...
you're my friend.
He was leaving to go to the country. He was just getting into his carriage.
He came over to greet me.
Was he alone?
Was his wife with him?
No.
I heard his wife was accompanying him.
I remember it clearly. He was alone.
People will invent anything to spread rumors.
He was alone.
As alone as you are here.
If he'd been with his wife, it wouldn't have mattered to me.
God damn it. Where are you?
I've sent you four texts, no, five.
You can't text me back?
Call me.
It's me again. Honey, I'm sorry. I--
I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to get angry.
Call me, please.
-[male voice] Hello. Hey, it's Jeffrey. -Hi, this is-- [scoffs]
-Shit. -Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.
Jeffrey, this is Jamal's mother.
It's, uh... Tuesday-- No, Wednesday night... m-morning. Um...
I'm looking for Jamal.
He hasn't come home, and I... I thought he might be with you.
I-I'm sorry to bother you, or, you know, call so early, but...
If you get this message and he's with you, can you please have him call me?
-My number is 305-- -[door slams]
Well, it's on your-- Oh, God, okay, hold on.
Just in case, no, um, 305-468-5900.
Okay.
-Sorry. -So I checked, like you asked, and the car does show up.
like you asked, and the car does show up.
-Yeah. -It shows up in the system.
-Shows-- -That's all we really know right now.
-Show-- Shows up how? -It just shows up, as, you know.
What's-- How does it end up coming to the attention of, you know...
Oh, it just was logged in, you know, from an incident.
It could've been ticketed, could've been towed...
But Jamal, my son, he was driving it, and he--
I thought you told me you weren't sure whether or not he was...
Well, yeah. Yes. Okay, yeah, I didn't see him drive away in it.
I did not actually see him get in the car. Correct.
But the car's not in our driveway.
He's been gone since eight o'clock last night.
Going on eight-- I mean, nine hours.
-He's usually home at midnight. -Right.
He never came home.
And when I called the police,
they said something happened to the car and--
I thought you told me they said it was--
Hold on. I wrote it down.
Okay, um, "An incident." [stammering] I, um--
That's what she said, an incident. "Identified in an incident."
Yes. I understand. And, listen, I'm really very sorr--
I'm sure that he's gonna turn up.
And you've already told me that you're not the registered owner of the vehicle.
So, I-I mean...
I told you I would verify the vehicle information anyway.
And I did that, okay?
He has work.
-Sorry? -Well, an internship.
Jamal, he has a very prestigious...
He has some place to be this morning.
-Sure. -This isn't like him.
-Ma'am-- -Look,
can't you do a missing persons report or something?
Not for 48 hours, no.
-Or if there's evidence of, you know-- -Foul play.
We don't really use that term. That's the movies.
Okay. Something bad. Whatever.
-Right. -He hasn't come home.
He's a responsible kid.
-His car could have been stolen. -We don't know that.
-He's missing! -Okay.
Isn't that enough?
Look, he's-- [scoffs] He's 16, 17.
Just turned 18.
Oh! Oh, so he's just about to graduate high school?
-Yeah. -So...
-So, what? -So he's probably...
out on South Beach
or, you know, well, I know you probably don't want to hear this,
but hanging out with some girl.
You know? Doing what teenage boys do.
Yeah.
I mean, that's what I was doing at that age.
Listen, I'd still appreciate it if you all would--
Ma'am, we will.
But you said that before, and you're leaving.
And I would really like to know what is going on.
Look, I told you, as soon as the AM liaison officer gets here--
-No, I mean now. -Sorry?
I want to know now.
Well, I will be happy to walk you back out to reception.
-You could check again to see-- -I was just at reception for half an hour.
-There's not much more I can-- -And the lady there,
-There's not much more I can-- -And the lady there, -she was no help at all. -I-- I understand.
Look, she sent me to you. This can't be that hard.
Look, she sent me to you. This can't be that hard. -I'm very sorry, ma'am, I-- -Either he's in the system or he isn't.
-I'm very sorry, ma'am, I-- -Either he's in the system or he isn't.
Ma'am, no disrespect, but we have a protocol.
Listen, I may seem paranoid, but he's not home.
His car is showing up on your radar.
-Humor me. -Ma'am,
as soon as the AM liaison officer gets here.
Officer, please.
-I don't know what you expect me to do. -Well, don't you all have computers?
I don't know, a database with names and DOBs you can--
Yes, but I am not authorized to just go running down the rabbit hole.
-What if somebody walks in, and they...? -Please.
-Fine. -[weeping]
[softly] Thank you.
But I'm gonna need some additional information.
-Sure. -All right.
Just let me-- Let me get something.
First name again?
Jamal, J-A-M-A-L.
Last name, Connor.
Yes. [chuckles]
-Is that E-R? -No, O-R.
C-O-N-N-O-R.
DOB?
5/1/2001.
Any priors?
Sorry?
Priors. Has he ever been arrested before?
Oh. No. [chuckles]
-Are you sure? -Yes.
-Even juvie. -Juvie?
-Does he have a juvenile record? -No.
-Nothing? -Nothing.
Not even a trespassing or resisting without, petty theft?
He's never so much as torn the tag off a new mattress,  okay?
-Excuse me? -Nothing.
No-- No arrest record at all.
Hmm. Uh, does he go by any other names?
Like a nickname?
I mean, his father calls him J.
No. Uh, AKAs?
-I'm sorry? -AKAs.
You know, "also known as." Like, street names.
Street names?
Yeah. Well, if he was taken into custody under a different alias, right?
He gave a different-- Well, different from some other time
-is all I'm saying. -I just told you he's never been arrested.
But just in case he might have been printed for,
I don't know, whatever. Or had a warning issued, or...
-A street name? -Right.
-Like Peanut? Or Black? -Exactly.
Or Pookie.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, there's June Bug.
-June Bug. -Yup.
-That's his street name? -Jesus Christ.
-[officer] Is it? -No.
It's not an alias. It's not a street name.
You sure?
It's what I used to call him when he was little.
It's what I call him now when I want to knock the cool out of him in front of his friends. He doesn't have a street name.
in front of his friends. He doesn't have a street name.
Can you please just run all this through your computer...
-Ma'am! I am going to. -...and find out what is going on?
I just need to make sure that we have all the correct information here,
so we aren't just spinning our wheels.
Fine.
Height?
Six-two.
Maybe a little taller since last time we measured him.
-He really shot up this year-- -Uh-huh. Weight?
Uh, 180... 185, thereabouts.
Glasses.
Cornrows.
Light green eyes.
[officer] Okay, good.
Uh, do you remember what he was wearing when he left last night?
I-I don't know. Probably jeans and a T-shirt.
All right. Does he have any distinguishing, you know...
Like a birthmark?
Yeah. Scars, tattoos, gold teeth. That kind of stuff.
No. No tattoos. No golds.
His only scar is on his stomach, right here.
Great. And that's from?
-The scar? -Yeah, where did he get it?
You mean, how did he get it?
Well, both, I guess, yeah.
-Does this matter? -[officer] Ma'am--
-It's not from a gang fight. -[officer] Okay.
-Lady, listen-- -Officer.
Respectfully, are there that many 6'2" Black boys
Respectfully, are there that many 6'2" Black boys involved in incidents tonight,
you need to know if they might just have scars on their tummies?
Not unless you want to find him. I mean--
Okay, Jamal's sign is Taurus with Virgo rising.
He's bashful, looks away when he smiles.
-Really, I am just looking for... -He plays the guitar.
-Especially likes blues and rock. -Ma'am.
-Old '70s and '80s bands. -[officer] Ma'am--
I tried to turn him on to Funkadelic -and DeBarge... -Ma'am, I--
-and DeBarge... -Ma'am, I-- ...but he's strictly mainstream classic stuff.
-Clapton. Van Halen. -[officer, irritably] Okay.
He throws a mean breaking ball, whatever that means.
-All right. Listen-- -He's vegetarian,
hates fried chicken, and he's afraid of clowns.
-Ma'am-- -He walks like a jock,
but he can recite almost any Emily Dickinson poem.
-Okay. -And he still gets a tear in his eye
whenever he hears "Puff the Magic Dragon."
Sorry.
I-I love Emily Dickinson.
"It is a far, far better thing I do than I've ever done.
-It is a far, far better..." -That's Charles Dickens.
Mmm... I don't think so.
Anyway, uh, let me see what I can find out, okay?
Oh, hey, was he angry or upset about anything last night?
Why?
Well, just in case he had a reason to, you know, run off
and chill for a while.
No.
-[thunder crashes] -Okay. Cool.
-Uh, help yourself to a donut. -Really?
Yeah. I know. What can I say? We really do like 'em.
Unbelievable.
-[cell phone ringing] -[whispering] Oh, God.
Hey, you on your way down here, I hope?
O-Okay.
Not yet.
I don't know.
Scott-- No, Scott, I said I don't know.
I've been trying to find out.
Well, because they're being very evasive.
I have no idea why.
Well, that's not true. I have some idea why. I--
I am keeping my cool.
It's-- It's not helping.
That's why it'd be nice if you were here.
Well, I called you almost an hour ago.
Yeah, I'm keenly aware of what time it is.
Well, you know what?
Maybe if you were home in your own bed
instead of sleeping in someone else's, we wouldn't be having this discussion.
No, I'm not starting.
I said I'm not.
No, I'm dropping it. Okay, but you-- [sighs]
In a waiting room somewhere in the back.
When you come through the entrance, turn left, park in the main lot up front.
Go to the info desk.
Ask for Officer Larkin. Larkin.
I don't know, some...
low-level newbie who ain't all that bright.
Yeah, okay. Bye.
Shit.
It's Mama again, baby.
I know you're still very upset,
and... we both said a lot of things we shouldn't have last night,
but I am worried about you.
Please call me.
-So? -[Larkin] Okay, there was an incident.
-An incident! -The car--
If you will allow me, please.
There was an incident. We don't know what.
The car was stopped,
and there is a pending investigation.
What does that mean?
That is all I can tell you.
Uh, Lieutenant Stokes,
he doesn't normally get in until about 8:00,
and I've been instructed that all further information needs to go through him.
I'm sorry, who?
Lieutenant Stokes.
Oh, he's the AM public affairs liaison officer.
Look, I'm-- I'm pretty new here. I don't know him personally.
They told me that he's been paged to come down here immediately, but--
But he might not get here for another few hours?
-He's been paged. -That's when he normally comes in.
Apparently.
Not acceptable.
No, ma'am. It is what it is. I...
No. I called the police -at three o'clock in the morning. -[sighs]
-I'm told my car's been involved-- -It's not your car.
My son's car!
My son is missing.
Now you're telling me he's in custody?
-No. -He might be?
-No. We don't know that yet. -We don't really know anything yet.
We don't know much.
-No. That is my point. -Is my son in custody or not?
I told you, you're gonna have to be patient
and wait for the AM liaison officer to get here.
I sat out in that lobby almost half an hour
before I even got to speak to you.
I completely understand your concerns.
Respectfully, officer, I don't think you do.
-Ma'am, I have kids too. -[woman] Do you?
-Okay. I do. -How old are they?
-[Larkin] Well, they're-- -Any of them Black?
Excuse me?
Do you have any Black sons...
this big...
who might just be sitting in police custody
at four o'clock in the morning?
-Look, Ms. Connor. I... -Ms. Ellis-Connor.
-Ms. Ellis-Connor... -[Ellis-Connor] Mm-hmm?
I am doing the best that I can...
-Do you have a Black son? -...to help figure out--
Wow. We are really gonna go there?
Oh, we've been there for a while.
[Larkin] No, ma'am.
I have two...
young daughters.
White daughters.
Then let's skip the empathy tactic, okay?
Because, believe me...
you got no idea.
Fine.
Whatever.
You know what? I really thought that we had developed a kind of--
Why are you still here?
-I'm sorry? -Go.
-[Larkin] Excuse me? -Please. Go find Jamal.
-Find my son. -I told you, Lieutenant Stokes
-will be here any minute. -I don't care who's on his way.
You got a badge too!
-You people... -Ma'am.
...got computers and cell phones, police radios.
You mean to tell me you can't walk out that door
in five minutes and find out where my son is?
-Look, I-- -Where is he?
I understand you're tense.
-[groans] -I understand this must be upsetting.
-Stop telling me you understand. -Ma'am, listen.
-And stop calling me "ma'am." -Okay.
Okay.
Listen...
[slowly] as soon as Lieutenant Stokes gets here,
I am going to see that you speak to him immediately.
We are gonna find out where Jerome is and--
Jamal.
-Jamal. His name is Jamal! -I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry. I-- -God damn it!
-Stop screaming at me! -Okay! Okay.
Okay. [inhales sharply]
All right.
Let me--
Let me start again.
I am... so sorry
if I implied or suggested any bad faith on your part.
I-I completely understand your concerns.
What?
You keep saying that, "I-I understand.
I... share your concerns."
Is that from some HR training video or something?
-No. -"When dealing with a problem personality,
-put the person at ease." -What?
-"Diffuse the situation." -No.
-"Echo their feelings." -I don't know--
Look, I have a PhD in psychology. I teach at the university. Okay?
So I know when I'm being managed.
Ma'am. Ms. Connor.
-Ellis-Connor. -I am not managing you.
Jesus. I'm just trying to be nice.
Sure.
[softly] You...
Look...
we have a protocol.
I...
Look, I'm supposed to follow it, but, you know,
let me see if I can...
I-- if I can pull a few strings.
You know, before Lieutenant Stokes gets here.
Just get a little more info, okay?
-I would really appreciate that. -All right, just--
Just give me a few minutes.
-Do you-- Do you need anything? -[sighs]
I swear, I am just being nice.
[sighs] Some water.
There is a water fountain down the hall.
Great.
It's out the door, around the corner to your left.
-Thank you. -There's two, actually.
-They're right next to each other. -Two doors?
No, sorry. Two water fountains.
You can't miss them. They're right next to each other.
It's 'cause the building's really old, and when it was built, it was...
Segregated?
Yeah.
There's, um...
you know, above-- above the water fountains,
there's, like, um...
there's, like, a commemorative plaque...
dedicated to, like, the Big Five or something.
The Big Six.
The Big Six!
Yeah. Yeah, Abernathy and, uh...
I can't remember all of them. It's just-- ah, it's...
fascinating, you know,  just the history.
Well, you know, I mean...
all they did for...
people.
[under breath] Son of a bitch.
-Excuse me. Are you-- -I was just texting Amy to get your ETA.
Jesus Christ, what took you so long?
-Excuse me? -Yeah. I'm sorry, sir.
It's just this lady has been really difficult and...
Yeah. I'm here about Jamal Connor.
Right, right. And she's gonna be right back so--
Okay. So far, um, all I know, the car is pulled over.
Uh, three Black males in a Lexus, like, a late model Lexus,
-I think. -Okay. Hold on.
Expired tags or the driver's texting,
not really clear on the reason for the stop.
-Exigent circumstances, I guess. -Okay.
There's not much in the system. Logged to the General Investigations Unit.
-The GIU? -Yeah, so, probably no big deal, right?
I mean, I got somebody in the GIU to give me a little bit of info...
-Listen. Slow down. -I know that's against protocol.
I'm just trying to keep the natives at bay until the cavalry arrives, you know?
Man, I'm glad you're here.
-Sorry. It's Officer Larkin, right? -Yeah.
Let me just back up, make sure I understand what it is...
Wait till you see this lady. Bitch is totally out of control.
I mean, I got kids too.
Right? But she went from, like, zero to ghetto in nothing flat.
[Larkin] Ma'am, this is Lieutenant...
-Hey. -[Scott] Hey.
-Jesus Christ, Scott. -[Scott] It's okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Where's our son?
Lieutenant Stokes is on his way. I'm really sorry for the delay.
They haven't told me anything, Scott.
-Not a thing. -Okay.
They don't know if Jamal's been arrested or if he's in custody.
Calm down. I wanna talk to the GIU detective interrogating my son.
Listen, as I have been telling your...
her, I'm not at liberty to give you more information.
-Now. -I'm sorry. Who exactly are you?
I'm Scott Connor. I'm Jamal Connor's father.
-No. I'm talking about... -Oh. I'm an FBI agent.
-I'm sorry if that confused you. -Yeah...
My son's a minor, we have a right to speak with him before you interrogate him.
-I'm sorry, sir. I'm not authorized-- -Scott...
I don't want you to be sorry. Take me to whoever is interrogating my son.
-Scott! -What?
His birthday was last month. Remember? He's 18.
-Shit. I knew that. -[Ellis-Connor] It's okay.
-Of course. -God damn it. I got him the car.
-You know I knew that. -Hey, I said it's okay.
It's four o'clock in the morning. I haven't had a cup of coffee.
-I understand. -Look--
Lieutenant Stokes should be here very soon.
I wanna know what's going on with my son, you've been in contact with the detective.
I'd like to have a word.
-[Larkin] No, sir. -Excuse me?
I have not been in contact with the GIU detective.
[Scott] Two seconds ago, you just said you had.
No, sir. That is not correct. I got somebody in GIU
to-- to read me a bit of information, secondhand, off the daily log sheet.
to-- to read me a bit of information, secondhand, off the daily log sheet. -That is all. -Uh-huh.
I've not been able to speak with anybody about the case yet.
There's a protocol that we have to follow, and it involves the AM liaison officer.
-And you don't know when he'll be here? -Very soon, I hope.
But if you'd rather not wait here, that's fine.
Uh, you can leave me your cell number. I'd be happy to call you when he arrives.
There's a Denny's on the corner.
-Yeah, it's a very short walk. -Thank you. We'll wait.
Sure.
Can I-- Can I get you anything?
-Coffee? -I'm fine.
Coffee would be great.
-[Larkin] Cream? Sugar? -No, I like it black.
Well...
[Larkin] Listen, I'm sure that this is no big deal.
I just started working here, but they tell me this happens every night.
We have a skeleton crew in admin on the late shift.
It can take forever for information to filter down, so...
Well, I apologize if I was, you know...
[Larkin] No, not at all.
And, listen, I'm really sorry about when you came in and I--
-Yeah. -Sorry about what?
Nothing.
-FBI, huh? -Yeah.
-That's awesome. -[Scott] Thanks.
[Larkin] It's my dream job.
-Is it? -Mm-hmm. Behavioral analysis.
-Really? -Yeah. I applied,
but they told me I needed investigative experience,
which is why I joined the force.
[Scott] Well, I hope you kicked ass in differential equations -or whatever... -[chuckling] Yeah.
BS in Forensics at Jacksonville State. Go, Gamecocks!
Good. 'Cause those guys in the Ted Bundy Brigade,
they're smart as hell.
[Larkin chuckling] The Ted Bundy Brigade, that is awesome.
Yeah. They don't like to be called that.
It's what the rest of us call 'em when we wanna piss 'em off.
Right.
I'd be happy to put a good word in for you when the time comes.
-[Larkin] Really? -Give me a call.
That would be so awesome.
-Thank you so much. -[Scott] You bet.
So, the Lexus.
It's registered to me.
-The... -The car,
my son's car, is registered in my name.
Scott Alan Connor.
-It was a birthday gift. -[Larkin] Oh, nice.
Yeah. Well, pre-owned. Still a little indulgent, I guess...
Oh, yeah. Whatever.
He worked very hard.
-Bit of a reach for us, but... -We thought he'd earned it.
[Scott] Anyway, we kept it in my name for the insurance.
But I can tell all that to the GIU guy myself
when you bring me down there to talk to him.
Right. So, coffee...
No cream, no sugar.
I'm on it.
What?
-What? -Nothing.
No, not nothing. What?
Why don't you just offer to cut and blow out his hair,
give him a hand massage, for God's sake?
-Kendra. -I mean...
-I'm just trying to be civil. -Whatever.
-Acting all crazy... -Who's acting crazy?
...isn't gonna help the situation.
They have our son.
We wanna know where he is. They can tell us.
This ain't complicated.
This is a bureaucracy.
I think you're assuming the worst, when the truth be told,
the current situation is probably a whole nother thing.
-Oh... -Look, I work at a bureaucracy.
I'm telling you, you're not gonna get anywhere chewing out some low-level yes-man.
I've been here for almost an hour.
-Look, alls I'm saying-- -"All."
All?
"All you're saying."
"All" is not plural. It's not a possessive.
There's no such word as "alls." Just "all."
Seriously?
Jamal doesn't "ax a question."
He doesn't speak Ebonics.
-You don't get to speak white trash. -Oh, Christ, Kendra...
"Alls I'm saying."
"A whole nother."
Just purge that shit.
-I'm sorry. "A whole nother"? -Yeah.
"The current situation is probably a whole nother thing."
Sweet sweating Jesus, Kendra.
-The word is "another." One word. -Okay.
Don't go shoving the word "whole" in the middle of it.
Can we not just go off in the weeds on some...
This isn't "off in the weeds."
You know how I killed myself to make sure Jamal speaks proper English.
-Yeah, believe me, I know. Yeah. -Okay? Good.
I mean, you just said "ain't" two seconds ago,
but I ain't allowed to. That makes perfect sense.
I said "ain't" for emphasis.
-You just speak bad English. -Jesus.
It's like every little thing with you lately.
No, this isn't every little thing.
As hard as I worked to make him fit in,
it's a slap in my face when you cavalierly lapse into "Okie from Muskogee."
Can we just--
Let's see if we can get our arms around the here and now.
Find out where J's at and not, you know,
rehash the last five years of our marriage.
-Would that be okay? -[Kendra] Sure.
Good.
And I've never forced you to make him fit in.
-Whatever. -Hey, I let you name him Jamal.
-Didn't I? -"Let me"?
-Here we go again. -Right?
Baby, I'm sorry,
I love your Irish people and all,
but I simply wasn't gonna go through life with a son named--
What was it you were putting on the table at the time?
Seamus.
-[chuckling] Hell, no. -[Scott chuckling]
I'd have gone with something else. Liam, Aidan...
Lord.
I needed to commemorate my brother.
I thought you understood that.
I did.
You know...
you may not remember, but in Arabic, Jamal means beauty.
Means beauty. Yes, how could I forget?
"Hey, Beauty. You wanna toss a football around?"
-[scoffs] -I can't wait 'til he's 21
so me and the guys can head on over to the tavern
and hoist a glass of whiskey with ol' Beauty.
-My, oh, my. -Maybe he'll bring his friends
Chastity and Mother's Milk along as designated drivers.
Is your sense of masculinity really that delicate?
-[outbound text swoosh] -Of course not, Kenny. Come on.
It's just a hell of a fun button to push.
His name is fine, all right?
You can't even say it half the time.
It's always "J" this, "J" that.
Oh, come on. I got a nickname for my son. That's just a male bonding thing.
Just man up and say it.
You've always hated his name...
because it's too Black.
You're the one who just said
-Seamus was too Irish. -You think his name's a handicap.
Well, you know what? On a scale from...
Eric Holder to, you know, Darnell Jackson,
Jamal is brushing right up against Darnell.
It must be terrible feeling so alienated from your own flesh and blood.
Hey, I'd challenge hell's furies for that kid, and you know that.
My only son.
-Should we try calling him again? -I've already tried about 15 times.
I just keep getting his voicemail.
Yeah, me too. "Hey, this is Jamal. Have a blessed day."
When did that bullshit start?
He's been going with me and Mama to church.
Thank you, by the way.
-[Scott] For what? -For taking her to dialysis.
-[Scott] Oh, please. -No, it's a huge help.
Bobby's like my own mother, you know that.
-[Kendra] I know. -She is a tough old broad.
She thinks the sun rises and sets on you.
She blames me for all of this.
You look good.
-Oh, Jesus. -[Scott] Well, you do.
Please don't go there.
We haven't really seen each other since... you know.
-Oh, I know. -Oh, can't I just notice?
What did you expect, Scott?
Four months without you, and I'd completely fall apart?
Is that what you were hoping?
-Christ. Forget I said anything. -Yes! Let's just forget it.
Let's just find our son and go back to our respective corners, okay?
-[Scott] Fine. -[phone chimes]
Is it Jamal?
No.
So, where was he last night?
-I assume he went out. -Yeah.
-With who? -I don't know.
You don't know?
-Why should I know? -Jesus Christ. Kendra.
I don't grill him every time he leaves the house.
He's a grown man. I trust his judgment.
You're the one who insisted that J live with you.
-[chuckles] -Which I was okay with.
But you took on an obligation to be responsible--
I thought we weren't going to rehash our entire relationship?
-Okay. Fine. -[Kendra] Fine.
It's just, I hate to keep harping on it,
but this kid's going to West Point in, like, a month.
-It is just not acceptable that he-- -Here we go.
It's not, Kenny.
Last few times he stayed at my place, he looked like a goddamned gangster.
A gangster?
Yeah. A "gangsta." There, I said it.
Why? Because he's not wearing Brooks Brothers?
Oh, the baggy pants, the cornrows,
that stupid loping, surly walk he suddenly developed.
He's a teenage boy, okay?
-A second ago he was a grown man. -He's just trying to figure out who he is.
-Oh, he's trying to figure out who he is? -Explore his own identity.
Christ almighty. Today it's cornrows,
tomorrow he'll be out helping OJ find the real killer.
Okay. See that right there? Comments like that...
You just don't get it. His world is not your world, Scott.
Oh, yes, it is. It most certainly is.
Look, I completely appreciate how you had to grow up.
Okay? The hard streets of Liberty City.
Interstate cutting through. Redlining. All of that.
I admire it. I always have.
It's one of the many reasons I...
You what?
-You what? -His world is not that world.
His world is definitely my world.
We worked hard to make it my world.
We spent almost a quarter of a million dollars
putting that kid through the best prep schools in the city.
He grew up in Coral Gables, for Christ's sake.
He's had every possible advantage.
I simply will not accept him regressing into...
Into what?
Just say it, Scott.
That young man has no excuse for getting himself into this situation.
What situation?
We don't even know what happened yet.
Something happened. I can take a pretty good guess what.
Why are you automatically gonna blame him before you even know anything?
You know he's driving around with two Black kids?
Oh, God forbid.
Oh, please don't. Don't do that.
Are you kidding me?
Look, Kenny, it's just you and me in here, so you can quit with the performance art.
-Seriously? -Kendra, come on.
He was out with two other Black kids, that's the issue here?
I mean what if--
How do you know who he was with?
This guy.
-This cop? -Yeah.
-Well... when? -When I walked in.
[scoffs] So the whole hour I'm here, he doesn't know a thing.
The minute you walk in the door, he's full of answers.
I wouldn't necessarily say "full of answers."
But he told you Jamal was in a car with two kids?
-They were stopped. -Two other Black kids.
-Yeah. -Well, he never told me any of that.
I wonder why that might be.
Right now, I don't really care. I just wanna know who they are.
Didn't your new buddy there tell you?
No.
And I think you'll agree this demonstrates
-some pretty questionable judgment. -No.
-Not necessarily. -Really?
He's got a right to be in a car with his friends
without getting dragged downtown at 3:00 a.m.
No one's saying he doesn't have a right--
Even if he's in a car with his Black friends!
-What Black friends? -Oh, Scott, come on.
What are you--
Can't you see what you're saying?
This is exactly what I'm saying. Listen to me.
What Black friends?
Was he with Jeffrey?
Was he out with Nate or Manny? Kids that we know and trust?
-Because that'd be one thing. -I told you, I don't know.
No. And he certainly wasn't out with Al.
No. Al's in Europe with his family on vacation.
Yeah. And Al is the only Black kid he hangs out with,
-which is exactly my point. -Funny. That's exactly my point.
-Oh, look, Kendra, I-- -You think our bougie son
has no right to associate with other Black kids
without stamping a presumption of guilt all over himself?
No. I think our half-white, half-Black, who-gives-a-shit-what-race-he-is son...
The one who got 1470 on his SATs and aced AP Physics,
knows better than to commit unforced errors in life by taking stupid risks.
Especially, when he is on the cusp of doing great things.
I think he understands that, like it or not,
the way that you present yourself in life has consequences.
If you wear your pants halfway down your ass
and ghetto hair, then you got--
Then you got no right to complain when you walk by
and a white lady clutches her purse?
You got no right to complain when you walk by
and any lady clutches her purse.
No. No, no, no, no, no. That is not-- No.
You are saying that associating with other Black kids
is taking a stupid risk.
Oh, come on, Kenny, that's not what I'm saying.
-Let me ask you. -You know that!
If this little asshole had told you that Jamal was in a car
If this little asshole had told you that Jamal was in a car with two white boys he barely knew, would you be blaming him then?
Would that be an unforced error?
If I didn't know 'em, if I hadn't met 'em,
Black or white, you're damn right, it would be.
Scott...
no matter how many privileges he's got,
the world still looks at him like it looks at me,
not you.
Oh, boy.
I tell you, I can see exactly what's been going on.
I'm out of the house a few months, and sure enough,
I'm out of the house a few months, and sure enough, you are filling his mind full of victimhood psychobabble.
-Oh, you know what? -"Pity me! Pity me!"
-I've done nothing of the sort. -[Scott] Yeah.
Instead of pointing a finger at me,
maybe you ought to be looking in the mirror.
Oh, this is my fault now?
Well, you're the one who disappeared at the pivotal moment in his life.
Excuse me?
You know exactly what I'm saying.
I coached his baseball team for ten years.
-Mmm. -I went to every one of his concerts.
Have I ever missed a banquet or a game or an event or a meet?
-That's not what I'm talking about. -What are you talking about?
You walked out on him.
I did not.
-Yes, you did. -Bullshit.
-You did. -No, I didn't.
I'm sorry, but that is exactly what you--
-[Scott] You know what? -You did!
You up and walked out on him.
I didn't walk out on him. I walked out on you.
I didn't mean for it to come out like that.
I just--
I'm so sick and tired of having the same frickin' argument with you
over and over and over again. That is what I walked away from. Not--
You know.
Shit. Kenny, I'm sorry.
Shit. Kenny, I'm sorry. -Stop. -I didn't mean to...
Just put the shovel down and stop digging.
Listen, J is on his way to being a commissioned officer
at one of the most elite institutions on Earth.
My job is done.
He is a man now.
A man I am so proud of.
I know.
So I cannot-- I cannot have you telling me I didn't do my job as a father.
Okay.
-I am not your father, Kendra. -[Kendra] Okay.
-That's what walking out looks like. -All right.
-That's what walking out looks like. -All right. -So don't. Don't. -Scott.
-Please. Please. -I said I get it.
Hey.
-[sobbing] -[Scott] Kenny.
Everything's gonna be fine, all right?
-Let's just try and relax. -[sighs]
This time of night, I always get agitated.
You have no idea.
I'm usually awake about this time.
I don't know I've had a sleep-filled night since that boy was born.
Most nights, my eyes fire wide open out of a sound sleep.
Heart beating so hard I feel it throbbing in my ears.
Always right about this time.
Too late to go back to sleep...
too early to get on with the day.
You... just snoring away.
Usually, I go stand in the door to his room...
and listen to him breathe.
Sometimes I go in and... touch the muscle on his neck.
Or shoulder.
Stand there and bullshit myself,
"Don't worry, Kendra, he is big and powerful.
This world can't hurt him."
Until that nagging feeling comes back, and I dwell on how fragile he is.
And whatever nightmare that has just woke me up,
someone texting in an SUV or an errant punch in a bar fight,
a ruptured appendix in some third world country. Most...
in some third world country. Most... Most mothers can sit there in the dark and get rational,
go back to sleep.
But sometimes, in my nightmares, I see nooses and crosses
and white men with Brylcreem crew cuts.
Last summer... when Jamal wanted to drive with Jeff to Bonnaroo,
-I was-- I just... -[Scott] No, look, J and I just thought
you were a little over-the-top with the mother hen thing,
thinking he was too young. -Too young? -[Scott] We disagreed and we moved on.
-Too young? -[Scott] We disagreed and we moved on. Too young had nothing to do with that shit.
My granddaddy was fighting in Okinawa when he was 17.
Too young?
It wasn't that.
It was the prospect of him driving  through the Deep South.
My son, alone with a white boy
driving Sherman's March to the Sea in reverse.
[sniffles] Maybe he and Jeff stopped to get gas in some little town
'cause he doesn't know any better
because we raised him to believe that the world is full-- [inhales sharply]
full of goodness.
And he starts batting his doe eyes at some cute little white girl.
Maybe the two of them walk into a burger joint,
happens to be an alt-right hangout.
Maybe... some guy with a swastika tattooed to his biceps
had a little too much to drink, and...
doesn't like the look... [crying] of this boy
who's poisoning the country's racial purity.
But the worst one, the one that always comes back,
is I see him getting stopped by a cop for doing nothing in particular.
And I see ankle-high boots and...
badges...
and nightsticks.
And I think back on that night I was...
five years old...
and watched my stoic mother doubled over,
sobbing in the kitchen
because Arthur McDuffie had been beaten to death by the cops...
[choking up] ...and they'd acquitted those cops.
And you... [crying] were a little boy asleep on the other side of town,
dreaming of becoming one.
[sobs] I'm scared.
Don't be scared.
-[Kendra] Yeah? -Yeah.
This is just some frivolous nonsense.
They probably had the music cranked up too loud.
-You think? -Yeah, you know how he likes to do.
Or his buddies had a couple of beers in the back seat, stupid shit,
kids sowing wild oats.
But let's not piss these people off, okay?
Let's just...
keep calm.
Half an hour, the three of us will be at Denny's...
having a teachable moment.
Have you talked to him recently?
I talk to him every day.
-Texting mostly, but… -[Kendra] No.
I mean, have you talked to him about…
[Scott] About what?
West Point.
What about it?
-I don't wanna get in the middle of this. -[Scott] What about it?
-Well, he's… -[Scott] He's what?
He's rethinking it.
He's rethinking what?
You should talk to him.
About what, Kendra?
He's thinking about taking the farm team contract.
Or maybe seeing where the guitar thing might go.
Really?
-Listen... -Jesus Christ, Kenny. Again?
It'd probably just be a deferment. He's afraid to tell you.
Yeah, well, he should be.
I hope this wasn't your idea.
-Okay, look. -Are you encouraging this nonsense?
He doesn't have the arm speed to make it out of Double-A ball.
He doesn't have the talent.
A brutal reckoning that I, his father,
not you, got to make with him, thank you.
And the guitar?
He's gonna, what? Play the guitar, like, for a living?
Just because you were too scared to pursue your dreams,
-don't take it out on him. -Oh, please.
Let him try while he's young.
At worst, he spends some time finding himself.
Oh, sure. You kick around trying to "find yourself,"
and before you know it, you're a 40-year-old dude
with a 150 IQ and no college degree.
Then you're making, what, 450 a week in a goddamn wedding cover band.
Being hired by a guy
who can afford to drop $100K on the wedding
because he didn't waste ten years of his life pursuing his dreams of, you know, the Olympic curling team,
pursuing his dreams of, you know, the Olympic curling team,
or writing the next great American novel.
-That's not what I meant. -The men in my family have
served this country every generation since they got here.
He is not entitled to break that tradition.
-Scott. -It's not an option.
-End of discussion. -[door closes]
[Larkin] Sorry to interrupt.
Coffee. No cream, no sugar.
-[Scott] Thanks. -[lock screen clicks]
So, I got some more information for you.
It's not a lot.
I checked the computer intake log again.
Your son was identified as a vehicle occupant
in a traffic stop in your Lexus.
I also confirmed there were two other Black males
in the vehicle when it was stopped.
Why were they stopped?
The log's not really that specific.
The general "infraction" category was checked off.
What does that mean?
It's just whatever the patrol officer logged in from his laptop in the patrol car.
He, like, checks off a box.
So this tells us nothing.
Well, it's not showing up as a pursuit following felony,
a stolen car, BOLO. You know, the really bad stuff...
-Okay. -...you can check off.
-[Scott] Who were the other boys? -Yeah, I'm not allowed to, um...
Okay, this stays between us. Badge to badge.
DaShawn Rolle and Jarvis Bell.
You know them?
Uh, Bell is a 20-year-old with misdemeanor convictions.
He had an open warrant.
-For what? -That I cannot tell you.
You see, Ken? Do you see what I'm saying?
Um, one other thing.
I gave your son's social media accounts a quick look over.
Really? That's what you've been doing while we're standing around in here?
Social media is, like, the first stop in missing persons cases.
-Oh, please. -Fact!
And that I did learn in a training video.
Your son posted something on Instagram.
A photo of a bumper sticker on the back of your Lexus.
"Shoot cops with your camera phone whenever they make a bust."
-Excuse me? -That is what it says.
-"Shoot cops"? -Yeah, yeah.
And those words were in, like, huge letters, okay?
-I think you're mistaken. -The rest of it in little fonts,
so all anyone who wasn't two feet away from the bumper could see
is a Lexus that says, "Shoot cops."
No... [chuckling] No, not my son.
Afraid so.
"Shoot cops."
Shoot people just trying to do their jobs.
-That's all you can see? -Yup.
-Jesus Christ. -Shoot people with wives and kids.
Son of a bitch.
Just shoot 'em 'cause you're part of the revolution or whatever, I guess.
-Kendra. -What?
-That car is registered in my name. -God...
This isn't about us, remember? Our son is in police custody.
Our son has a bumper sticker on his car that says, "Shoot cops."
-My son. I'm the cops. -[Kendra] Scott.
-God damn it. I'm the cops! -This is about a camera phone.
Jesus, Scott!
Right now, I couldn't care less about you and him
and your goddamn thin blue line.
I care about finding our son.
Did you know about this? Had you seen it?
Kenny, please tell me that you didn't know about this.
-Please tell me that you didn't-- -Listen to me.
There are three Black kids in his school.
Three out of 400 and something.
And the other two are dating each other.
-He's... -Oh, no, I totally get it.
Being one of the only Black kids
at the most expensive prep school in the city...
versus being a Black kid at, you know, MLK Senior,
where you gotta go through metal detectors every day,
that entitles you to put a bumper sticker on your Lexus
that says, "Shoot the stupid dumbass who bought me this car."
He is grappling with a lot right now.
-He's depressed. -Oh, Jesus.
He's confused.
Bullshit. Look, I'm sorry to be venting like this in front of you.
Oh, no, listen, I totally hear you.
Where is Jamal now?
What I just told you, that is all that is in the system,
and I wasn't even supposed to tell you that.
I'm really supposed to wait for this Lieutenant Stokes guy to get here.
But, I tell you what, I will go and check the computer again,
see if someone might have logged something in
in the last few minutes.
[Kendra] You know what?
I sat around here almost half an hour.
You couldn't tell me a damn thing.
Except for maybe how to go on a self-guided, Jim Crow tour through the building...
And then as soon as my husband shows up, my white husband,
suddenly you are as helpful as can be.
-[Scott] Kendra! -Why is that?
Do you not want me to go look at the computer again?
-[Kendra huffs] -If you wouldn't mind too much.
I'm sorry, I didn't get your first name.
Paul.
Paul, if you wouldn't mind, we'd really appreciate it.
Sure thing.
-Refill? -That'd be great.
"That'd be great."
You know what else would be great?
If you took my side at some point.
Damn it, Kendra.
You're so goddamn nice to him, it's making me sick.
-"Shoot cops"? For Christ's sake. -That's why you're kissing this guy's ass?
No. I'm ready to put my fist through the goddamn wall.
Put yourself in Jamal's place.
-Oh, give me a break. -No! Just for one minute,
put yourself in your son's place.
He is the only Black person
most of those little white kids at his school know.
Most of 'em...
only Black people they've ever exchanged two words with
are the Jamaican hospice woman who wipes bubbie's ass,
and the people at some Habitat for Humanity house
they helped build just so they had something to put on their application to Princeton.
-Look, I get that. -You have to understand, Scott.
Jamal is going through...
an awakening.
-An awakening? To what? -[Kendra] Yes.
To this.
Okay.
And? [exhales]
And...
Philando Castile.
And Eric Garner.
And Tamir Rice.
Every time it happens,
he feels the world close in on him a little.
And it's coming at him from both sides
because all of his white friends think he represents the entire race.
It's not like if he was at a school with other Black kids he could lean on.
He is the one all the white kids look to.
There is immense pressure on him to--
[chuckles] I'll tell you what he calls it, "the face of the race."
That's what he says, "I feel like I am the face of the race."
-He told you this? -[Kendra] Many times.
He never said anything like that to me.
Baby, look at you...
and look at me and reckon why that might be.
When these men get shot down,
he can feel their ghosts.
That bumper sticker was--
Was what?
No, really, I--I...
-I want to understand. -[sobbing]
Can you see that Jamal is also right, here?
Filming cops is all these kids have.
It is their last line of defense.
Shit. God forbid I'm stopped, it's mine too.
That is the world we live in.
Whether you get it or not.
No, I get it. I do.
I get it.
I just--
He still should've known where this kind of thing can lead.
Where?
Here? [sniffles]
-Tonight? -Yeah.
-Because of a bumper sticker? -Yes.
You really think that's what this is about?
-Sure didn't help. -A bumper sticker?
Look, if I'm a cop rolling down the street at 2:00 a.m.,
and it's a close call on probable cause…
The bumper sticker would push you over the edge?
-You bet. -Oh... [chuckling]
Especially, if after I make a warning stop,
I got some uppity asshole lecturing me about his rights.
[whispering] Son of a bitch.
What?
"Uppity"?
-Oh, come on. -Is that what you just said?
-[Scott] Kendra, please. -Unbelievable.
-[Scott] Jesus Christ. -From you?
I don't even know what to say.
God damn it, don't make this about how I tripped on some coded word fossil.
I cannot have J lapsing into a life where he makes excuses for himself all the time. I won't.
And I won't have him walking around apologizing for who he is.
-No one is asking him to do that. -Yes, they are.
"Keep your hands on the wheel, boy. Look straight ahead.
Don't make any sudden moves.
Wouldn't want to make the man in the bulletproof vest nervous
when he walks up to your window pointing a glock at your head."
Your father ever tell you that?
-He never had to. -You're goddamn right, he didn't.
Look, Kenny.
I'm as eager to sort this out as you are. He is my son, too.
I just don't think that, you know,
lecturing these people on Black Lives Matter is gonna help.
Let's try...
catching flies with honey, okay?
Maybe they need a little lecture.
They sure fittin' to get one when I sue their asses.
Look, alls I'm saying...
all... all I'm saying...
is let's give these people the benefit of the doubt
and not act like we're in some ass-backwards Klan county in South Carolina. This is Miami, for God's sake.
in South Carolina. This is Miami, for God's sake.
Where my Black, PhD-having ass
still has to drive down something called "South Dixie Highway" to get to work every day.
Kenny, I see your point. I do.
But throwing all that up in white people's faces
makes them feel like shit.
And when you make people feel like shit, they tend to not wanna help you.
[Southern accent] Yes, sir, Massa Scott.
Auntie Kendra don't wanna hurt nobody feelings.
I sorry, Massa Scott.
What is so funny?
You.
Being ridiculous.
My husband laughs when I pretend to be a house slave,
-and I wonder why we're separated. -[Scott] Oh, Jesus.
Boy. I tell you, did you and I ever agree on anything?
-Oh, come on. -No, did we?
Seriously?
Seriously?
The importance of hard work.
Frugality.
Respect for our elders.
Bourbon Manhattans at dusk out on the patio.
-Okay. -[chuckles softly]
-Thelonious Monk. Right? -Mmm.
Yeah. We always agreed on Thelonious Monk.
Yes, we did.
Thai food.
-Right. -The U.
[laughing] Yes.
-Cormac McCarthy. -Mmm. [chuckles]
The Cayman Islands.
Sex.
Yeah.
The morning J was born was the best day of our lives.
-We definitely agree on that. -Right?
I mean, I still can't.
I just can't...
I mean, Jesus Christ.
When I was at that conference in Atlanta a couple months ago,
I saw another bumper sticker,
"Don't Blame Me, I Voted for Jefferson Davis."
Nobody was pulling him over.
That's just some bigoted asshole, Kenny.
But in Atlanta.
In the capital of Black America,
white people get to glue their anger all over their car bumpers.
Well, I cannot answer for every racist white person.
No? You're not the "face of the race"?
Well, I'm glad to see that this is the standard we're holding our son to.
What standard is that?
Looking for a bigot behind every tree.
Because that's what this shit leads to.
"Shoot cops" bumper stickers and all this micro-aggression bullshit...
-Can we drop it? -...on college campuses.
I mean, seriously, Kendra, what were you thinking?
He just put it on the car today or yesterday,
I'm losing track of time here.
-So you did know it was there? -Scott, yes, I saw it.
I didn't like it either,
but Jamal has been on edge about everything lately.
You weren't around. It was up to me to do triage.
I decided the bumper sticker was a battle that could wait till morning.
I-- I told him not to get in that car until he got rid of it.
Okay. Fine. But once this is done, we're gonna sit down, have a little chat
we're gonna sit down, have a little chat  about the quality of your judgment on this.
Wow.
Okay.
You know what?
I'm not running cover for you anymore.
He put the bumper sticker on the car to get back at you.
He's furious with you.
What? For what?
What do you think, Scott?
For leaving him.
Sorry, leaving me.
-He told you this? -Told me...
I had to watch my six-foot tall son
cry his eyes dry about three nights running.
Calling you names they haven't invented yet.
That poor child was curled up in my arms like a little baby.
-I... I... -I...
Yeah. That's what all this is about. The bumper sticker. The cornrows.
-It is a rebellion against you. -No. No.
-Bullshit. -No, honey. It's not bullshit.
It's called the science of human psychology.
This is what young men do
when the person they have modeled their whole identity and moral code over--
Hell, what is the clinical term?
-"Fucks over his family." -Kenny...
[Kendra] He hates you right now!
And for the first time in his life, he hates being half-white!
I told you,
I am not happy about the goddamn bumper sticker
or the cornrows or the baggy pants,
but it is just a phase he will get over. Hopefully a short one.
I am just trying to help him reassemble a very fragile identity,
an identity that you busted into pieces when you walked out that door.
So get off my back about this
because you don't get to take the high road here.
-Stop it. -[phone chimes] No! You--
It's not J. Fuck.
You really need to be texting her now?
-It's my brother. -What?
-He sent a link, he said it's urgent. -Dwyane Wade dunking?
You two can't bond over your man crush some other time?
[man] Aw, man. Aw, man.
-[man 2] Don't do it, man. -[man 3] Nigga, stay down.
[man 2] Don't do it, man!
[man 3] Stay down, nigga.
Jesus.
Scott, what is that?
It's, um...
I-- I don't...
-Uh... -Scott?
-I-- No. Nope. No, honey? -Yes.
Kendra, stop it. God damn it, honey, please don't.
[man] Aw, man. Aw, man.
-[man 2] Don't do it, man. -[man 3] Nigga, stay down.
[man 2] Don't do it, man!
[man 3] Stay down, nigga.
Okay.
Jesus.
What...
-What's it mean? -I don't know.
-Is that Jamal? -Jesus.
-Scott, is that him? -I don't know.
Is that him?
No, Kendra, I don't know. Give me a second.
-Well, what does the text say? -I wasn't paying attention. Um...
"Look ASAP, AM stringer posted this on the CBS4 site. Is this J?"
Let me see. Let me see it.
-[indistinct yelling on phone] -[man] Aw, man.
Scott, I think that's him.
Is that him? The one running?
-Kendra. -No-- No, God. In the blue shirt.
-[man 3] Stay down, nigga. -I think that's his shirt.
Let's just take this one step at a time, okay?
-Okay. -I'm gonna call my brother at the station.
-I wanna see it again, make sure. -Give me a second.
Let me get a hold of my brother, see if he knows anything.
Hey, John. It's me.
So is that J in the...?
-Well, did he say whether or not he… -What did he say?
Okay.
Well, can you text me his number so that I can…
-Who? Who is he? -You don't? Okay.
-[John] All right? -Yeah. Thanks.
What did he say?
Just that the police station monitors, the-- the police scanner,
and they heard reports of a warrant stop, a traffic stop,
and a witness, a bystander, some guy happens to be there
and he sends in this footage.
-Is it Jamal? Was he hurt? -John doesn't know.
Just that the chatter came back with my car, and he sent the link.
-He doesn't know. -Wait.
It could be him, Scott. He could be hurt.
Jamal could be hurt.
-We have to… -I don't know.
I saw what you saw, okay? I mean, I--
-Hey! -I got your refill.
-Have you seen this? -Huh?
Have you seen this?
No-- No. Seen what?
[man] Aw, man. Aw, man.
-[man 2] Don't do it, man. -[man 3] Nigga, stay down.
[man 2] Don't do it, man!
[man 3] Stay down, nigga.
I want to know what's going on with my son, now.
I don't know what this is.
It's a video. Apparently from a traffic stop.
What video, from what stop?
The stop where-- I don't know, that's why I'm asking.
Our son and other kids, we think.
-Where did you get it? -Forget about where we got it.
I'm trying to understand why you think this has to do with your son.
His brother sent it and thinks it could be Jamal.
Forget about all that. Where is our son?
We just wanna know if he's okay.
Look, I told you, Lieutenant Stokes is on his way down here.
He'll be able to tell you.
Okay. Listen to me. I have been--
We have been waiting and we've been patient.
But our son is in custody, your custody. You have him.
We would like to know where he is. We would like to talk to him.
-[Larkin] I understand. -We want to talk to him.
-[Larkin] I'm doing everything I can. -[Scott] This is easy!
-[Larkin] I'm doing everything I can. -[Scott] This is easy! I'm gonna make this very easy for you.
I wanna know where my son is right now! I wanna talk to him.
Okay. As I have explained,
I am not authorized to tell you that.
All right? I think that if we all just calm down here for a second
and stop jumping to conclusions--
-Oh, God! -Where is my son?
[shouting] Where is my son?
Sir, you just committed a battery on a law enforcement officer.
-That is a second-degree felony. -Listen to me, you little shit.
If you don't tell me where my son is right now,
I'm gonna commit a capital felony. We are done being strung along!
-[Kendra] Scott. -[man] Sir!
I'm gonna ask, please, take a seat and calm down.
-Who are you? -Sir, please.
Take your fuckin' hands off me.
-I'm gonna ask you nice one more time. -Sorry, who the fuck is this?
Officer, your cuffs, please.
-You have the right to remain silent. -You kidding me?
[man] Anything you do or say may be used against you...
-You're kidding. -You have the right to consult an attorney
-before speaking with police. -You kidding?
-before speaking with police. -You kidding? -[man] Afraid not. -Why am I arrested?
-[man] Afraid not. -Why am I arrested? You have the right to an attorney…
-What is happening? -You are kidding me.
If you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed free of charge before any questioning, if you wish.
If you decide-- Stop.
Listen to me. You wanna keep on racking up charges
-or calm down and get this over with? -Just don't fucking touch me.
Officer, give me a hand. Turn and face the wall.
-I'm not gonna turn-- -Don't resist.
-Take your goddamn hands off me. -[Larkin] Sir!
-[Scott] Take your hands off me! -Stop it.
-Let me go. -Stop it. No!
-Let me go! -He has a heart murmur.
-Sit him down. -He has a heart murmur!
Son of a bitch. Fuck.
-Hey. -[Kendra crying]
What is wrong with you people?
-That's enough. -What is wrong with you?
I said that's enough. You injured?
-Uh... -Are you injured?
-Well, he certainly could have been. -[man] Sir?
Get pictures of him. His face and hands.
Yours and mine, too.
Was that at all necessary?
-Unfortunately, it was. -[camera shutter snapping]
Now, we all calm?
We all settled down?
Good. My name is Lieutenant John Stokes.
I'm the AM shift liaison officer.
I understand there was an incident.
-We wanna know where our son is. -Quiet.
We wanna know now. We wanna know right now.
Okay, I'm gonna try this one more time.
I don't wanna take you into custody.
I'd hate to see you lose that badge and pension
I'm sure you've worked very hard for.
I have a right to know where my son is.
You're mistaken. You have no such right, sir.
Your son is an adult who's the subject of an investigation.
Right now, you have the right to sit down and shut up.
-Do you understand? -He understands.
I'm talking to him. Do you understand?
I'm talking to him. Do you understand? -Fuck you! -Scott, please.
-Fuck you! -Scott, please.
-Take him up to intake and book him. -No.
Two counts battery on a law enforcement officer,
two counts resisting with violence.
And every time he so much as flinches or looks at you cross-eyed
between now and being fingerprinted,
add a charge of resisting without. Got it?
Yes, sir.
Do I take him into custody?
If he can calm himself, give him a "promise to appear" and cut him loose.
You people are animals.
Do I need to call in a taser and backup, or you gonna hold it together?
-I'm fine. -[Stokes] All right.
-And you'll be hearing from my lawyer. -And you'll be hearing from mine.
My lawyer's name is the state attorney.
What's your lawyer's name?
Get him out of here.
Now, again...
my name is Lieutenant John Stokes.
I would very much like to know if my son is okay.
If you will be still, I will tell you everything I currently know.
I will not be lectured
and this will not devolve into a shouting match.
When did I ever shout at you?
Ma'am…
Fine.
I will tell you what I know.
You will quietly and politely listen,
or I will simply walk out that door
and you can find out what it is you want to know in due course.
Understood?
Who is your supervisor?
Sorry, understood.
Excuse me?
I said "understood."
Good.
This is what I know.
At approximately 02:15 this morning,
a late model silver Lexus was pulled over by a patrol officer.
That Lexus is registered to a Scott Alan Connor.
That's my husband.
Three African-American males have been taken into police custody
in connection with the incident.
We don't know much more about the stop except…
-The cop shot at someone. -I won't compete
-with your outrage and speculation. -I saw a video.
There were shots fired.
-I don't have confirmation of that. -But I heard it.
[voice cracking] I heard it.
You heard noises on a grainy video. I'm trying to get facts.
He called one of the kids a nigger.
If you'll let me finish…
He called him a nigger. I saw it. I heard it.
-No, ma'am. -You saw it!
Incorrect.
One of the people taken into custody was a bystander,
a Black bystander,
who shot that footage with his cell phone.
It's his voice you hear on the video.
Not the voice of a law enforcement officer.
Why was Jamal stopped? He-- He doesn't drink.
We just bought the car. The brake lights were working. -Ma'am-- -He had his registration
-Ma'am-- -He had his registration and insurance card with him.
-I made sure of that. -Ma'am.
He wouldn't have given anyone any reason to stop him.
No one has said your son was stopped.
There are at least three individuals involved in this incident.
I don't know who was driving the vehicle when it was pulled over,
and neither do you.
[Stokes] You'll cause yourself a lot less heartache
if you'll stop jumping to conclusions.
At the moment... I don't know why the car was stopped. Okay?
Okay.
And right now, what I've told you is all I know.
All right.
As soon as I know anything else, I'll immediately--
Fine!
[Stokes] I will tell you this.
The car had a bumper sticker on it that raises some concerns.
I am aware of that.
Kind of makes your close scrutiny of your son's insurance
and registration card moot, now doesn't it?
I don't see how.
Come on, my sister, I know you know better than that.
I am not your sister.
A Black boy in that car
with a bumper sticker like that?
He's asking for trouble.
And what does that tell you?
It tells me that the world is not the same for people who look like you and me.
-Oh, Jesus Christ. -Yes.
That's what it tells me.
And it tells me that the people who patrol the streets
with legal authority to use deadly force are not robots.
They help their kids brush their teeth at night
and read them Dr. Seuss
and pray they get to do it again the next night.
And when they see some nihilistic, agitating young thug,
-pride may get the best of them. -Who do you think you are
calling my son a thug?
Running cover for some cracker-ass cop.
The cop is Black.
The one who made the stop...
he's Black as you and me.
Let me tell you something, lady.
I parachuted out of planes.
I crawled through VC tunnels in Vietnam,
but the most scared I have ever been in my life, ever,
was when I made my first traffic stop on a ghetto street.
You know why?
Because there are hip-hop songs and bumper stickers
and mobs shutting down the interstate
saying that the cops are the enemy.
So it's okay to challenge them, it's okay to question them.
If they pull you over, it's okay to bust out with an attitude
and act like gangsters and have swagger.
You step up to a cop, that makes you hard, right?
Well, all that bullshit gets cops killed.
I don't know who you're talking about, but that is not my son.
My son was taught to be respectful and assert his rights.
When I pull you over, you got no grounds to "assert your rights."
You know what you got the right to do?
Shut up and do what I say.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
You serve us. Not the other way around.
What if your car matches one in an Amber Alert?
What if you fit the BOLO of someone who just shot up a school?
When you get pulled over, you got no idea what it might be.
Some hard-acting fool just gets in the way.
Maybe if you'd have grown up in the Pork 'n' Beans like me,
you'd understand that Black boys don't act gangsta to be hard.
They do it to hide their fear.
I come up in Overtown, lady.
Ain't nobody got to tell me why they do what they do.
But hold up.
Y'all's family is living the American Dream, ain't ya?
Your son got no reason to be afraid, right?
Is that what I'm supposed to be doing?
Teaching him to be scared?
Be a good boy, keep his mouth shut?
-Damn right. -[Kendra chuckles]
And make sure he understands, that for us...
there ain't no American Dream.
Well, I guess I just wasn't raised to be a bitter Uncle Tom like you.
Lady, you got a nerve.
You damn right, I do.
-[Stokes] I'll tell ya... -Mm-hmm.
...two minutes with you,
and I know your whole adult life.
-Oh, bullshit. -No, but I do.
I know you got a husband
carries around a picture of you on his phone,
and every time he say some fool-ass racist remark,
he pull out that picture and go,
"Oh, no, not me. 'Cause looky here at my Black wife."
I know you could never explain to him that pain in your heart.
That pain that claws out your contentment
because every public service announcement for hepatitis C
and every malt liquor billboard got somebody on it
look just like your baby boy.
Or why your son was the tallest and the smartest kid in third grade,
but the teacher never seemed to call on him
no matter how high he raised his little brown hand.
See, 'cause that's a pain your man could never understand.
So you tried to kill that pain by making your son proud
and telling him to live the American Dream
and teaching him to assert his rights,
instead of teaching him how to survive as a Black man in this country.
Fuck you!
One thing I already know for sure about this incident.
Just like almost every other one of them,
if the young brothers would have just shut their mouths
and done what they were told,
none of us would be here tonight,
which is what I suggest you do.
Sit tight.
And shut up.
And, sister,
next time you call a Black man an Uncle Tom,
it'd play a whole lot better if that Black man
it'd play a whole lot better if that Black man hadn't just dragged your white husband out the room in handcuffs.
They booked me. Gave me a "promise to appear."
Stupid. Stupid... I don't understand this. I don't understand...
Why did you walk up to me at Carl and Joy's party?
What?
The first time we ever met, why did you walk up to me?
Why did I... oh...
-Kenny... What? Now? -Tell me.
-Tell me again. Please. -Babe. I...
Because...
Because I was staring at you?
No. I was staring at you. I couldn't help myself.
-What else? -I, um...
What else?
You don't think Jamal got himself into some kind of situation…
We were standing on Carl and Joy's patio and we were staring at each other…
That's right. We were staring at each other.
We couldn't take our eyes off each other.
-[Kendra] And? -And I...
walked over.
You walked over to me.
[Scott] And my heart was beating so fast I could hardly talk.
And there were all these girls parading back and forth to the bar,
but you never looked at one of them.
You just kept walking and staring at me.
-[Scott] Yeah. -[sobbing]
-But then you looked up. -[Scott] I looked up.
Right past me.
And I thought... "Okay. Maybe not."
-[Scott] But I... -[Kendra] But you...
[Scott] ...put my hand on your shoulder.
[Kendra] And you pointed out a bird...
in a tree.
This gorgeous little red bird.
[Scott] And it flew away.
[Kendra] And you told me it was tired of being... [both] The second most beautiful creature at the party.
-[Kendra] That's what you said. -[Scott] That's right.
-[sighs] -Hey.
Hey, come here.
It's okay. It's okay.
-It's coming apart. -Mm-mmm.
Yeah, everything's coming apart.
Kenny.
I know you're not coming back.
[sniffles] It-- it hurts, Scott.
It hurts.
And the fact that she's white
makes it almost unbearable.
I don't love her.
[sniffles] Then why?
I just...
[stammering] I don't...
-[crying] Kenny. Ken. -[Kendra] No.
We made a magnificent person, didn't we?
We did.
I was thinking...
before you came back,
about that time when you and I were fighting--
I don't even remember what it was about--
But Jamal was a baby, and I was upset.
And he thought that I was crying about the thunder and the lightning…
-I remember. -And he said...
-I remember. -And he said... "Don't cry, Mama.
It's just God taking pictures of the rain."
[laughing] Yeah. We... We put it in his baby book. [laughs]
[Kendra] And he... He grabbed my tears
with his itty-bitty hands and he tried to put them back in my eyes.
-[Scott mutters] -Last night, I told him…
[Scott] What?
What?
-Ken. Kenny? Kenny. -No.
We were both furious, and he was yelling at me, and-- and I…
-You what? -[Kendra] I said things to him.
Okay. What things?
-Oh, God. -Kendra. Hey, hey.
-Ken... -Horrible…
...ugly...
things a mother should never say to a child.
-Okay. -Oh, God.
[voice trembling] I just wanna hold him.
I wanna look him in the eyes and I just wanna--
I wanna take every word I said out of his head
and bury it in the ground.
-It's okay. -God damn it! "Shoot cops."
[gasps] I should-- I should have gone out there with a razor
and peeled that goddamn thing off his car.
No.
I should've gone out there as soon as I saw it.
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't make a difference.
It's not your fault. It's not his fault.
It's not your fault. It's not his fault. I'll never say a cross word to him again. I just need to know he's okay.
He is. He's okay.
-Please, Jesus, let him be okay. -He's okay.
He's okay.
-[door clicks] -He's okay.
Your son, Jamal Connor, was a rear seat passenger
in a vehicle with a Jarvis Bell
and a DeShawn Rolle.
Bell was wanted on a misdemeanor warrant for marijuana possession.
The car was tailed by a Metro cruiser near the Scott Projects in Liberty City,
where the driver was observed purchasing a nickel bag of marijuana.
God damn it.
Following the purchase, while driving westbound on 79th Street,
the car was approached by a marked patrol car.
Officer Rodney Banks, who had witnessed the purchase,
pulled the car over.
The camera on the patrol car
shows Officer Banks approaching the driver's side of the vehicle.
Mr. Bell was driving the car.
The officer returns to his vehicle with the occupants' identification
and apparently begins checking them on his laptop.
After approximately 30 seconds, Mr. Bell exits the vehicle
and attempts to approach the officer.
The officer pulls his gun and gets Mr. Bell to the ground.
Oh, God.
[Stokes] As the officer calls for backup,
DeShawn Rolle exits from the rear of the vehicle.
The officer trains his gun on Rolle.
At that moment, Jamal Connor exits the vehicle
in an apparent effort to place his hands on the hood of the car.
-No. -[Stokes] It's wet, he may have slipped,
as Jarvis Bell simultaneously begins to stand up and take flight.
The officer, now confronted with all three vehicle occupants,
one of whom has a warrant,
and not having searched the vehicle for a possible weapon…
Oh, no.
...fires three shots at the fleeing suspect.
Either a stray shot or a ricochet, we don't know which yet,
strikes Jamal Connor in the head...
killing him instantly.
I am... terribly sorry for your loss.
No... [screaming] No!
There will be a full inquiry.
"Me neither."
Those were the words that started the whole Emma Gale success story.
And for 20 years and 12 novels, it seemed like nothing could go wrong.
Until now.
[assistant] Hello, Ms. Brown. Welcome to The Drew Barrymore Show.
Thank you.
Can't I just go home and wait until this blows over?
This is not blowing over. This is a Category 5.
Do you know how many people hate you because of this book?
A lot?
It's showtime.
-I thought you were my friend. -Well, right now, I'm your agent.
So go out there and charm everybody's pants off.
And try not to look so tall.
It's intimidating.
I suppose it's possible you might not have read a Sophie Brown novel,
but trust me, you know somebody who has,
and, boy, do I have some questions for her.
[man] Hm. Join us in welcoming back my good friend and best-selling author, Sophie Brown!
Thank you. Oh, thank you.
-Hi. -Hi.
Thank you for having me. I'm surprised I made it in alive.
[chuckles] I barely did.
All of you viewers, if you wonder what we're talking about,
I'd say that Sophie Brown has a whole lot of unhappy fans out there.
Well, I think you might mean former fans.
Well, I guess we're all wondering about the ending of your latest book.
I know that the character of Winston charmed many of the readers.
Then why in the world would you kill him?
-The readers, they loved Winston. -[audience clapping]
Maybe they just didn't know him like I did.
We don't always get the happy ending.
You know, I normally don't do this,
but I have got to agree with the fans out there.
He didn't deserve to fall down the stairs.
So you're on their side?
Well, you murdered a man that I was in love with.
I mean, what gives you the right to take him away?
Well, I'm… I'm the author.
I know, but perhaps you're having a hard time
separating your real life from the fiction in your books.
-What? -[Drew] Well, you've had a rough year.
Your husband left you. You had a very messy divorce.
Okay, but Winston is a fictional character.
-Was he? -Yes.
And you should be happy that it was a quick death, yeah,
because I could have extended it for ten pages.
I could have dragged him behind a car. I could have poisoned him with mercury.
I could have chopped him into little, teeny pieces
and fed him to the sharks!
-[TV show theme music playing] -We'll be right back.
I became a writer so I could write in my pajamas,
not so I could get yelled at by strangers.
I thought you became a writer because of Grandpa.
You used to sit in the barbershop and listen to his stories, right?
Yeah.
About the castle.
-About Scotland. -Mm.
He had told me that he snuck in once. [chuckles]
Yep.
He told that one a lot.
Are you sure you're gonna be okay? 'Cause I can come back next weekend.
Absolutely not. You stay at school. Don't worry about me. I got this.
Okay.
[Sophie] I need to forget about the Emma Gale fiasco for a while.
[Sophie] I need to go away.
Dun Dunbar.
The castle.
I'll go to Scotland.
It's hidden away, and it's quiet, and nobody knows me there.
Mom, this is great. You're finally taking a vacation.
Not a vacation.
A working trip.
Just until the bad press dies down.
I can write the new Emma Gale,
bring Winston back, and everything will be back to normal.
All right, well, at least promise me you'll see the castle.
I promise.
That's me.
Ah, you're American.
Yes.
[in Scottish accent] Nobody told me that.
Whereabouts?
[in Scottish accent] Where are you from?
[in English] No. No.
This is all the luggage I have.
-[in Scottish accent] It's not a problem. -Oh. Thank you.
♪ Sometimes we get away with it ♪ ♪ Sometimes we get burned… ♪ ♪ Sometimes we can just learn from it ♪
♪ Sometimes we can just learn from it ♪ ♪ Or we just get burned ♪
-Hamish, no! Hamish, stop! -[Sophie gasps]
Well, I'm glad you were… here.
He, uh… [chuckles] …doesn't usually like strangers.
-[dog barks] -Neither do you, ya dobber.
Thank you.
Enjoy your stay, then.
[Sophie] Hey. Are you the welcoming committee?
Oh, hi. May I help you?
I'm checking in.
Very good. Follow me.
Isn't that Sophie Brown?
In our wee village? Dinna be daft.
-Welcome to the village inn. -Thank you.
I have a reservation under Sophie Brown.
Sophie Brown, the author?
Not sure I should admit it, but, uh, yes. [chuckles]
I've read all your books. [chuckles] I just finished the last one.
Wonderful.
-May I ask you a question, then? -Sure.
Why'd you leave it so long to kill off Winston?
-What? -I was hoping you'd do it in volume one.
I never liked that sod. Too bloody perfect.
You know what? I'm not so sure I did either.
-Bugger. -[Sophie] Bugger.
-[chuckles] I killed him off. -Good for you, Sophie Brown. [laughs]
[Sophie] Sod. Got any other names for him?
Oh, it's lovely.
That's very kind. I'm sure it's not what you're used to.
Actually… [chuckles]
…it is exactly what I was hoping for.
Is Dun Dunbar Castle nearby?
[woman] Aye, it's just over the hill.
Well, if you need anything else, Ms. Brown, just ring.
Thank you. And it's Sophie.
Maisie.
Nice to meet you, Maisie. You too.
[agent] Scotland? Really? Why didn't you clear this with me first?
Because you would have talked me out of it.
-How long have we known each other? -Too long.
Since page one, book four. And when have I ever steered you wrong?
-The title of book six. -Oh, aside from that!
Don't worry. I'm here to write.
Good, and when can I expect to see pages?
Soon. It's practically writing itself.
-Goodbye. -Bye. [blows kisses]
Right, now, the gift shop is right here.
-[man 1] No, thank you. -[woman 1 sighs]
Uh, no, you've missed the… the gift shop.
No? Well, surely you don't wanna leave without a souvenir.
[woman 2] No, thank you.
Kilts, tea towels, coasters? All with the clan coat of arms, of course.
But of course.
Well, may your travels be swift.
Something on your mind?
Several things.
[guide] Aye, well, perhaps one of them could be fixing the door to the library.
-It's hard to get the people in. -Aye, it's even harder to get them out.
Hello there.
Hi.
-So you work here too? -Wherever they'll have me.
You just missed the tour, but the next one's Thursday.
Oh, well, um, could I just wander around a little on my own?
[laughs] I'm afraid that's not--
It's all right, Thomas. I'll give her a tour.
-I wouldn't want to get you in trouble. -Take my chances.
This way.
[man] There are more than 3,000 castles in Scotland.
Some date back to the 14th century.
These grand old ladies hold the proud history
of all those who lived, worked, and fought here.
Look at that staircase.
Aye, it's one of five.
What's up there?
Upper floors.
This here is the music room
where the third duchess wrote a book of poems.
-Have you read it? -Aye, and I wouldn't recommend it.
-So you're here for the day, then? -A little longer.
Aye. Tourists don't usually stay in our village.
We're more of what you call a drive-through.
Dun Dunbar was built by the first Duke of Dunbar for his wife.
Been in the same family for 500 years.
-Who owns it now? -Just some royal arse.
-[dog collar clinking] -Hamish! Hamish. -[Sophie] Oh my goodness. Oh! -[Hamish whimpers]
-No! No! -Okay. Hi.
Never seen him like this. Have you meat in your pocket?
I always carry a steak on my person. [laughs]
Out now. Go on. Get out. Go on!
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
So, this is the older part of the castle.
Dates back to 1500.
The Dunbars had meetings of the clan and grand celebrations in here.
Come on. There's more.
This staircase was built clockwise.
Apparently, the best way to defend by a right-handed swordsman.
What's up at the top?
Twelve bedrooms and ten bathrooms.
I guess the, uh, royal arse needs a lot of thrones.
Never enough.
-Can we go up? -Sorry, not part of the tour.
Can I steal you away from the tour for a moment?
Can it wait?
There's a couple wanting to talk about a wedding. All right. How do they look?
-Like they can afford it. -Stay put.
I won't be long.
Top
of the circular…
…staircase…
…there's
a hallway.
Okay.
At the top of the stairs, there are three doors.
One, two, three.
[man] Hello?
Miss?
Hello?
Hello? -[door opens] -Hello, miss?
-[door opens] -Hello, miss?
Miss?
-What are you doing? -I'm sorry.
I just needed to see something.
And what could you possibly need to see up here?
Okay, the thing is, I have a little family history in this place.
-Oh, do you now? -Yes.
Don't tell me. You did a DNA test, and your ancestor's Mary Queen of Scots?
I said I was sorry.
Do you know why no one's allowed up here?
I'm guessing frostbite. Because it's someone's home.
How would you like a parade of gawkers traipsing through yours?
Tour's over.
Uh, that'll be £20.
[scoffs] The sign says ten.
Private tour's more.
Ah, I dinna have change.
Well, consider it a tip for your warmth and hospitality.
Well, here's a tip for you.
Stay out of places you don't belong.
Keep him away from people.
Right. Well, we try.
What was all that about?
Book the wedding.
-[woman 1] I would love to see you dance. -[woman 2] Well, those were the days.
-[woman 1] Go on, then. Give us a show. -[woman 2 laughs]
-[Maisie] Oh, I'd like to see that. -Hi.
-Enjoy the castle? -I did, yes. It was magical.
I love your books.
-I rather love them too. -We've read every one.
-I told them not to bother you. -[Sophie] Are you kidding?
You may be the only readers left who don't hate me.
So, knitting in a pub?
Do you knit?
Oh, no. I mean, I've always wanted to learn, but…
Oh! Well, these might come in handy.
Then you can join our club.
Thank you. Um…
Helen.
I'm Sophie.
I'm Rhona.
I'm a pastry chef, but for now, I make biscuits in the bakery across the way.
Thank you. [chuckles]
These are… [chuckles] …delicious!
And this is Angus.
His husband was one of the original members, but he passed on.
Not long after, Angus showed up. Hasn't stopped knitting since.
Here, would you like me to show you how to knit?
[Sophie] Yes, please.
Well, come on, then.
-Not letting this go though. -[Helen] No.
[Sophie] That is my daughter, Lexi.
She's away at college now.
-Oh, it's hard when they move away. -It's harder when they move back in.
And your husband?
Uh, it's been a year since my divorce.
-Oh. -It's been four since mine.
I've got a boyfriend in the bakery.
-He just doesn't know it yet! -I'm still married.
Although, I'm not sure he knows it either.
-[Sophie laughs] -Not true. You two are madly in love. We are.
It's nice to hear him laugh like that. He hasn't spoken a word since Graham died.
[Rhona] I still can't believe
you chose our little village to write the next Emma Gale!
Well, I was supposed to come here a long time ago with my dad.
But he got sick, and we never made it.
I'm so sorry.
He lived at Dunbar Castle as a kid.
Well, outside the castle. They weren't allowed inside.
-His family, they were the groundskeepers. -You mean your family?
My family. The McGuintys.
Ah, you're one of us, then. [chuckles]
McGuinty. I… I don't think I've heard that name around here.
Well, they moved to New York when he was a boy.
I was at school with a McGuinty back in the day.
A real talker, that one.
Always blethering and telling the tales.
-[Helen chuckles] -Callum McGuinty?
That's him.
Of course, we called him something else.
McMotormouth.
[Helen] Oh, you have his smile.
[sobs] Oh, I don't know why I'm crying.
Because these are your roots, dear.
I wish I'd come back sooner.
-Well, you're here now. -[Helen] Mm-hmm.
And you got to see Dun Dunbar while it's still a castle.
-What do you mean? -It's… it's up for sale.
A lot of the old castles are for sale.
Aberdeenshire's cheaper than a Range Rover.
And you'd be more comfortable living in a Range Rover.
-[Helen] Oh, Angus. -[Sophie] Wow. Thank you.
[Helen] That's great.
[man] So someone wants a trophy castle?
I didn't get that feeling.
It's worse, then. They wanna tear it down for condos and a golf course.
Here's the offer.
And it's rather large.
I'm doing the tours and the gift shop.
I've agreed to the weddings and… and maybe even a funeral or two.
Maybe your own.
Look, we've been mates for a long time.
I've bent over backwards, keeping you out of foreclosure.
I just need a little more time, Ian.
There is no more time unless you sell off the farmlands.
No, I can't do that.
-Myles-- -No, it's out of the question!
Uh, Ms. Brown has arrived.
-Sophie Brown. Myles Dunbar. -You're the royal arse?
-You're the buyer? -He let me think he worked here.
[Myles] It is work being me.
And you can't just show up and decide to buy a castle, like some hamburger.
-Well, you did say it was a drive-through. -I'm not selling to her.
Mr. Dunbar.
Technically it's "Duke."
Uh, Myles is the 12th Duke of Dunbar.
Oh, well, forgive me, Your Highness.
Technically, it's "Your Grace."
I can think of a few other names I'd call you.
And you wouldn't be the first.
And FYI,
the title does not come with the land.
So if that's what you're after, you can buy a ladyship online for £30.
The only title I'm interested in is my next book,
which I'm going to write at Dun Dunbar in the library.
I'm not giving up 500 years of history on someone's whim.
-It is not a whim. -Oh my. What is it, then?
Do you believe in love at first sight?
No, I don't.
Me neither.
But if I did, that would be what I felt when I saw Dun Dunbar.
It felt like home.
Aye. My home.
My father's too.
On the grounds. A long time ago.
-His family worked for yours. -Try again.
I thought that dukes were supposed to be gentlemen.
Those are English dukes.
Well… [chuckles] …this was clearly a mistake.
-Yes, it was. -Thank you.
-You're welcome. -Not you. Him.
You realize you just handed over Dun Dunbar to the bank?
What can I get you?
What do you, uh, recommend
to obliterate the memory of the most awful, arrogant person you've ever met?
-Got just the thing. -Mm.
Thank you.
Whiskey. Large.
You'll keep Thomas on.
What?
He's lived here his whole life.
I've had a change of heart. Oh, so you actually have one.
If I agree to this, there are conditions.
Ninety-day escrow till Christmas.
Deposit's non-refundable.
-What else? -You'll move in now.
-Now? -Aye.
-Are you moving out? -[chuckles] No.
I am not living with you.
Look, this has nothing to do with you and me.
There is no you and me.
Exactly. If I'm gonna sell the old girl, I need to know you can take care of her.
And you need to know how hard that is.
Dun Dunbar is a living, breathing thing.
She needs constant attention,
or she'll crumble like an oatcake in the rain.
Gift shop? Two quid. I'll throw it into the deal.
She'll realize the mistake she made and be gone in a week.
Meanwhile, her deposit will get us through spring,
and I'll figure out something after that.
-And if she doesn't leave? -Oh, she'll leave.
I'll make her life so miserable she'll never want to see a castle again.
Aye. Well, you do have a knack of driving people away.
You're still here.
Aye, but you pay me. Barely. Besides, who else would put up with you?
-[laughter] -To women buying castles.
To all of us.
-[all] Cheers! -[laughing]
"Slainte" is what we say in Scotland.
Slainte. Okay, here goes. Oh.
Wait, wait. I thought you said you were buying a castle. [chuckles]
I did. Mom, are you drunk?
Oh! Not anymore. I'm buying Dun Dunbar.
Why?
Oh, I… I can't explain it.
Um, except for the fact that I think he would want me to.
I can almost picture his face when I walk through that door with the key.
Aw. I haven't seen you smile like this in a really long time.
[chuckles] I know. It's like it was meant to be.
Although I have to live with him till Christmas.
Him? Who's him?
[exhales] Thank you, Eamon.
-[Hamish barking] -Oh, Hamish! [laughs]
Hi, big boy.
Shall I announce you?
-Really? -Oh, aye.
[shouts] She's here!
-Hello. -Hello.
Here. The key to my castle.
Now you get the real tour.
The £20 version wasn't real?
Before we get started,
you should know, here on the estate, we have a community-owned wind farm
where we create 70% of our energy.
We also have sustainable forestry and organic farming.
I'm an environmental engineer.
[clicks tongue] Four years at Oxford, two years Cambridge.
Oxford and Cambridge.
Linen closet, water closet.
-Maybe I need a map. -Gift shop, £5.
King James.
And this here is Flemish, 16th century.
And through here, my room.
I will have no reason to go in there. We agree on that.
More rooms. No power, leaky roof.
This one's nice.
The fifth duke died in here, in that very bed.
Horrible death.
[Myles] There's a reason they set horror movies in castles.
It leaks after every rain, and it rains 150 days a year.
Plumbing's intermittent, 60 fireplaces half work,
Wi-Fi is iffy,
cell signal's worse.
But there's running water?
-[Myles] Aye, it runs. -[water dripping]
Oh, by the way, we don't heat the upstairs.
Too costly.
This way.
So, you'll stay in this one.
[scoffs] Are you sure the duke didn't die in this room,
and he's still in here somewhere? Oh!
-Why? -[clears throat] Is this room not up to your standards?
Is there a closet? There's a chair.
Bathroom? It's down the hall.
Fireplace doesn't work though.
I'll take it.
Good.
Oh, by the way, I looked up your family. There's no Brown in the records.
-That's my married name. -Oh, you're married, then?
-That's my married name. -Oh, you're married, then? Divorced.
Aye, now that I can believe.
Leaving so soon?
[Sophie] Follow me.
Take a look at that.
[Myles] What is that?
My father.
"McGu" is your father's name?
McGuinty. He got caught before he could finish.
Didn't think there was anything here I hadn't seen. When was this?
Sixty years ago. He was a kid.
He snuck in and made it upstairs.
He just wanted someone to know he got inside.
But some heartless stuffed shirt tossed him out and fired his father.
-Aye, that would've been my grandfather. -Sorry.
Nothing I haven't said myself.
My old man wasn't much better.
McGuinty, it's a strong name. You should stick with that.
[chuckles] Hamish.
What do you want?
-Should we go get a cup of tea? -[barks, groans]
Okay.
I'll follow you.
Okay.
We're lost, Hamish.
All I want is a cup of tea. Is that too much to ask?
I thought that… that this was the kitchen.
As long as you're here, do you mind pouring me another?
-You could've locked the door. -Why? It's my house.
For now.
[exhales] Seriously?
Thanks a lot, Hamish.
[Sophie] Be happy that it was a quick death. I could have extended it for ten pages.
I could have dragged him behind a car. I could have poisoned him with mercury.
I could have chopped him into little, teeny pieces
and fed him to the sharks!
Where did you get that?
Maisie.
Page one. "Do you believe in love at first sight? I didn't used to."
"I'm Emma Gale."
Now, where have I heard that before? Oh, right. Your sales pitch.
-I meant it. -Did you now?
"The first time I laid eyes on Winston,
he felt like home."
-Are you gonna read the whole thing to me? -No, page one's good enough for me.
May I have some coffee?
Help yourself.
If you are trying to discourage me,
a cold room and a couple of bats in the attic are not gonna do it.
-Oh, aye? -Mm.
What will, then?
Nothing.
"'I will not be discouraged,' said Emma. 'I will get what I came for.'"
Yeah, this is Pulitzer Prize stuff, this.
[Sophie] Morning.
Well, you remember what happened when it was purple, don't you?
That was a one-time thing.
[Sophie] Hey. Hi.
-Good morning. -Morning.
-What are you guys doing? -Graffiti knitting.
Yarn bombing. It's a thing. Perks up the neighborhood.
-How was your first night at the castle? -Cold.
Well, he'll warm up.
The room.
Well, you're just in time to stop this massacre.
Rhona wants to chop it off and dye it green.
Ooh. I really hope we're talking about hair.
[chuckles] I just need a change.
Maybe I can help.
I grew up over a barbershop owned by the best scissor man in Queens,
and an expert colorist. Let's do it.
-[Rhona] So, I think a bit of color. -[Sophie] Okay, all right.
-Helen? -Hello.
Hi. Yeah, I'm gonna need your help.
-Okay. -At the castle.
-[Helen] Does she know we're coming? -[Maisie] I just texted her.
[Rhona] Great.
Oh, that is perfect.
Come on, then, slow coaches.
[Helen] That will be lovely up there in that room.
[Maisie] Ah, yeah, we're right behind you, Speedy Gonzales. I see you running off.
[Helen] Dinna hang back. Knitters to the rescue.
-I've never been up the stairs before. -Well, it's clear you haven't missed much.
This is perfect.
-Not as perfect as my hair. -I have to admit, it does suit you.
Well, this is looking rather nice.
Is it?
Where's the Scotch dresser? And the lamps?
-I haven't the slightest. -[Maisie] Hm.
Maybe your memory's fading.
No. I remember everything.
-Okay, what's with you two? -[exhales] Nothing.
Oh, that's been going on forever.
And?
Maybe we dated for a bit before I married Sean.
Well, you're not married now, are you?
Thank you.
Oh, I don't know how to thank you.
Not necessary. We knitters look after each other.
No one crosses the knitters. Right, Angus?
You know, I've known Myles my whole life.
After you get past that upper crust, he's got a good heart.
-[scoffs] -It might be hard to see right now.
You couldn't find a better landlord. That's for certain.
Landlord?
My family has been tenants on the Dunbar land for generations.
Mine too.
The 11th duke squandered what remained of the family money,
left Myles with an empty title,
a mountain of debt, and the whole village counting on him.
The whole village?
It's the reason he's selling the castle.
So he can pay off the debt on the farmlands.
That way, whatever happens,
we'll all have a place to live. Hm.
Hm. Except him.
Come after finals. We can have Christmas here.
Mom, Dad didn't tell you. Dad didn't tell me what?
He's marrying what's-her-name on Christmas.
Well, good for them.
I… I told him I'd go, but I really don't have to.
Honey, you have to go.
Is that him?
Oh. Myles?
This is my daughter, Lexi.
Oh, uh, nice to meet you. You too.
I'll call you later.
Thank you.
[Myles] It's not for you.
The damp air degrades the books.
The knitters told me some things.
I think maybe my first impression of you was wrong.
I doubt it. So, who's what's-her-name?
-So you were listening? -I may have heard a word or two.
[exhales] The woman for whom my husband left me.
Well, you're better off, then.
Obviously, he's an eejit.
That actually sounded like a compliment.
It's more of an insult to him.
Well, I'll take it.
If I'm being honest, it wasn't all his fault.
I've spent most of the last decade on my computer.
[exhales] I was married once. A long time ago.
She left me for someone with a bigger title.
A title climber.
Aye, pretty much.
I thought we were happy.
At least I was.
When she left me, I came back here to put myself back together.
Dun Dunbar's been my life ever since.
Oh, what am I saying? I sound like a character from one of your books.
-So you're reading my books? -Point is, people leave, we survive.
I guess I just never thought I'd be alone at this stage of my life.
You're not alone.
You've got Hamish.
Come on, then.
-What? -You're clearly not writing anything.
Oh, look at the hairy coos.
-Morning rush hour. -[mooing]
[Myles] Sheep.
You might know them as expensive sweaters.
[Sophie] Really? You mean like the one you're wearing?
That one's for sale too.
-[Myles] Ocean view from every room. -Central air conditioning.
And it comes with its own graveyard.
That's a selling point.
Exactly. You never have to leave.
[Myles] There's one more place I'd like to show you.
-[Myles] Mind your step. -[both chuckle]
So, this is Dun Glen Holy Well.
Watch your head.
What are all these?
[Myles] Locals leave them. Legend dates back to the first Duchess of Dunbar.
When war broke out, she donned the garments of a warrior,
came to this very well, and laid a necklace on the edge for courage.
What happened?
Well, she went off to fight.
Turned out she had the heart of a warrior.
She ended up saving the village and falling in love with a man who fought by her side.
A commoner.
That's beautiful.
Aye. If you like that sort of tale.
Did they end up together?
Wed on Christmas Eve at Dun Dunbar.
Invited the whole village.
And every Christmas Eve after that, for a century or two anyway.
Christmas Eve at Dun Dunbar for the village.
We should do that.
We?
Whoever owns it.
Aye, we'll see.
Okay… [exhales] …that's the end of the tour.
How about we end it at the pub?
[Myles] You know,
I dinna really hang out there all that much.
[Sophie] Mm. We'll see.
[Thomas] There he is.
-[Helen] Everybody's here. -[Maisie] Oh!
-Oh, come on. -No, no, no, I don't wanna.
-What's the matter with you, man? -No, I cannot sing.
Course you can sing. Anyone can sing. Here we go. Come on.
♪ By yon bonnie banks And by yon bonnie braes ♪
♪ Where the sun shines bright On Loch Lomond ♪
♪ Where me and my true love Will never meet again ♪
♪ On the bonnie, bonnie banks Of Loch Lomond ♪
♪ You'll take the high road And I'll take the low road ♪
♪ And I'll be in Scotland afore ye ♪
♪ Where me and my true love Will never meet again ♪
♪ On the bonnie, bonnie banks Of Loch Lomond… ♪
Go on, then.
Come on!
[man] Go on!
-Oh, this was unexpected. -Aye.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
[Myles] I mean,
it's… it's not like this was a date or anything, right?
-Of course not. -No.
Handshake?
Why not?
-Good night. -Good night.
And this wasn't a date.
Duly noted.
Come on, Hamish.
Come on.
Hamish!
Wee traitor.
[Thomas] Well, it's been a month now,
and she's still here.
Thirty-two days, actually.
It appears you're warming up to her.
Just keeping my enemies closer.
-Hey, Thomas. -Aye?
Come here.
-What? -Tell me something.
-Am I starting to look like them? -No comment.
-No, that's worse. -No?
No. Look, you've spent your whole life trying not to be them.
So don't be.
Meaning?
You've been alone a long time in this castle.
-I'm not alone. I've got you. -Aye.
And here the two of us are,
standing around looking at old paintings of people we hated.
[Sophie] "The wind was speaking to her."
[Sophie] Come on, wind.
[Sophie] "The well was speaking to her."
[Sophie] What the heck was the well saying?
[Sophie] "The well whispered a story to her longing heart."
-Hello. -Tell me you've at least started.
I have started.
[agent] What is the plan here?
I don't have an exact plan.
-Just come home. -I can't.
You can't just run off to Scotland and hide out in a castle.
Why not?
I'm not going to tell you that your life depends on writing this book.
-Oh, gee, thanks. -But your career does.
And I know you, Sophie. You have worked your whole life for this.
What are you without it?
-[door opens] -I don't know.
[Thomas] Very good, everyone. Follow me.
I'll call you later.
And this is where the third duchess would retire… Ay, oh.
Sorry. [chuckles]
Don't mind me.
Oh my God, that's Sophie Brown!
[Thomas] Everybody, if we could, um, just move on.
I've read all your books. Could I have a selfie?
-Oh. -Of course. [chuckles]
Right. All right, then. No, let's continue on. That's very good.
You know what, Thomas? I have an idea. Why don't I give the tour?
[all] Yes! Please!
Well, why not indeed?
[man] Thank you.
William Wallace, the very mason who built Edinburgh Castle,
put these in himself, and they are filled with legends.
[Sophie] So, in 1745,
the sixth Duke of Dunbar barricaded the old castle walls
and stood against the British army for three weeks.
[whispers] It was 1746. Fifth duke. Castle held for four weeks.
[clears throat] And over there,
it looks like a duke.
-[murmuring] -[Sophie] Walks like a duke.
[gasps] It is a duke!
It's been an absolute pleasure.
[Thomas] Oh, I'm glad to hear it. Glad to hear it.
Don't be strangers.
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to reorder.
Maybe stock some of your books.
-Oh, I wouldn't go that far. -Hey, well done.
Thank you, Thomas.
[Sophie] Hello.
Well, she's good for business.
You know, it wouldna be the worst thing to let someone in again.
Let her in?
I'm trying to get rid of her, you divvy, or have you forgotten?
What's all this?
They're here to collect Sophie.
Great.
-Hello. -[Myles] Maisie.
You look different.
Quite lovely.
Thank you.
It's all Sophie.
Sophie?
No, she did my hair.
[Helen] And mine.
-She did everyone's hair? -[Helen] Uh-huh.
She's not doing mine.
-Oh! I'm sorry I'm late. -[Maisie] Oh, no bother.
Come on. Get in. It's nice and toasty.
-Hi. -Come on.
Hello, Angus.
-[chuckles] -That's it.
[Helen] Let's get going.
-[Rhona] How are you getting on? -[Sophie] All right. So…
[clears throat] Whiskey, and leave the bottle.
So you're a regular now?
Very funny.
Maybe he wants to learn how to knit.
[Helen] I tried to teach him when he was wee.
[Helen] No looking.
[Maisie] Uh, mind my wall, fella.
We need to talk.
About what?
Outside.
I'm trying to be accommodating here, but, um,
this whole thing, it's not working for me.
What thing?
-You. -Oh.
You're just… You're too much. You're everywhere.
The redecorating, the gift shop, the tours.
You stole my dog. The knitting!
I mean, what's next? You're gonna run for mayor?
Is there an election?
This was not part of our deal.
-Our deal? -Aye.
The one where you drive me out, and I forfeit my overpriced deposit?
I may not have gone to Oxford or Cambridge,
but I know how to read a contract.
No one in their right mind would have signed that, but I did.
Because I am staying through escrow,
I will be here on Christmas and New Year's.
-In fact, I may never leave. -Mm. Maybe this is my next chapter.
I don't know.
I don't know anything.
And it's scary.
Guess I settled that, didn't I?
[Helen] Just keep knitting.
[exhales] Come on, Hamish. Good boy.
What are you doing?
-I don't like unfinished business. -Oh, of course.
You're getting rid of my father's name.
-Thank you. -It's not for you.
He worked here. He's part of the history.
-This your way of apologizing? -It is not.
I accept.
I am not apologizing.
And I accept.
[Sophie] "The well whispered a story to the wind about a woman."
Bloody hell, that's terrible.
Warrior woman, speak to me!
It's a week before Christmas. I need to at least write the first page.
Come on, warrior woman. Come on. Speak to me.
Please say something.
Come in.
Just gonna sit there, or you gonna help me move it in?
[Myles] I brought you a Scotch dresser.
You got this for me?
Aye. Found it in the attic.
-Oh. -Just, uh, touched it up a bit.
Well, it's beautiful.
How's, uh, Emma Gale?
-Emma Gale and I have parted ways. -Oh?
There's actually another story that I would like to tell.
Oh, aye? What kind of story?
It's about a woman,
a well, and a sword.
So she's doing the killing?
-She's saving a village. -From what?
You're gonna have to read it.
Send me a copy when you're back in New York.
Give me a forwarding address.
Thank you.
I love it, Myles.
I'm glad.
Myles?
There is something we need to talk about.
A Christmas tree
for the ballroom.
So, what do you usually do at Christmas?
This.
Actually,
this is the first Christmas I'll be without Lexi.
Well, why don't you invite her, then?
She's got a wedding.
Oh, right.
The eejit and what's-her-name.
Okay, so "eejit" is "idiot."
Aye.
-"Diddy" is "idiot." What's "dobber"? -Aye.
Spineless idiot.
"Numpty"?
Useless idiot.
Okay.
"Walloper"?
Aye, that's more of a moron.
[chuckles] Got it.
What about this one?
Aye. That's a fine one.
What are you doing?
Every time we cut down a tree,
we plant two in its place.
[Sophie] That's lovely.
I always try to leave things better than I found them.
-Aye. -Announcing the knitters of Dunbar.
It's a little early for a party, isn't it?
Well, there will not be any party without their help.
Or my yule cakes. I'm baking for Dun Dunbar!
[Maisie] It's stunning.
-Oh, Your Grace. -Aye?
I can't tell you how much it means to everyone in the village,
celebrating at the castle.
Well, I… I wish I could take the credit, but it's all her.
Actually, it's us. [chuckles]
Not that there is an us.
No, no.
Uh, excuse me.
Don't worry about him. He'll just get in the way.
[Helen] This one's nice, isn't it?
I suppose it's about time these things saw the light of day again.
I cannot believe this.
Hey. You remember this? Your three-legged cow.
Three legs is better than whatever this was.
-Hey, don't make fun of my sheep! -[chuckles]
-I worked hard on that. -I know. I remember!
This one cut right in the back of his father's favorite chair.
Then we had to go hide it in the stables! Remember?
Uh, knitters, shall we?

-Shush, you. -Anyway, I was…
-Don't. 'Cause I was going to say… -Mm-hmm. -…that I've got three-- Oh. Sorry. -[bell dings]
-Buongiorno. Yes. -May I help you?
Yes. I would like a room for the night, please.
Okay. All we've got left is the Christmas Romance package. [man] Oh.
-Champagne in the evening. -Really? -Breakfast in bed. -Hm.
All the Netflix you can binge.
Thank you. We'll take that.
-Yes, we will. -[Maisie] Very good.
-Can I take your name, please? -Donatelli.
[Maisie] Excellent.
Maybe you're right about this party.
Did you just say I was right?
I said maybe.
I should probably tell you,
that bedroom you liked, where the fifth duke died,
I made that up.
Just wanted you to have the worst room.
I know. The fifth duke died in the Battle of Culloden.
The sixth was thrown from a horse,
and the 11th, your father, died alone in a hotel room in London.
Aye.
Ugh! Not again.
Excuse me.
I suppose you know how I'm going to die too?
I could come up with a few ideas.
-[grunts] -Electrocution.
Not mercury poisoning?
Or being fed to sharks?
[chuckles] Well…
I'm sure those could be arranged too.
It's probably all those Christmas lights you made us put up.
Oh, sure, blame Christmas.
I would never do that.
I'm blaming you.
I think you might be needing these.
Judging by your last foray into the electrical problems,
it's going to be a long, dark night.
Thank you, Thomas.
[Sophie] I do feel good about this.
I feel comfortable with it.
I told you, your fans don't want something else.
They want Emma Gale.
Harper's is talking an additional four-book deal.
Claire--
You'll do the morning shows, tease the new Emma.
Emma Gale isn't real.
I am. Sophie Brown.
Maybe not even Sophie Brown.
Sophie McGuinty.
Sophie McGuinty.
-Who is that? -I'll let you know when I figure it out.
Well, she better know how to write.
What's with all the candlelight? Did you go back in time?
He fixed it. [chuckles]
Oh my God. You are never coming home, are you?
You are falling for this guy. The… the earl!
Duke.
You know, I can work with this.
You become a duchess, and we can rebrand you.
No one is even gonna remember this fiasco. This… This is genius.
Close the deal.
Goodbye.
Well, tomorrow's Christmas Eve.
I'm aware.
And Christmas the following day.
That's generally how it works.
Can't you just admit you have feelings for her, eh?
And even if I do, what difference would it make?
She's here to ruin me.
-Ruin you? -Aye.
This is the happiest I have seen you in years.
-Oh, what do you know? -Everything.
-[Sophie] Hello. -Oh, hello.
[Sophie] I am sorry I am late.
But I need a group opinion on this dress.
I found it in bedroom nine.
Too much? It's totally too much.
You have to wear it.
It's gorgeous.
[chuckles] I don't even know if it fits. I can alter it.
[chuckles] Okay. Um, all right.
So now I have something
for all of you.
I… I don't think we should be wearing Dun Dunbar dresses to the party.
Not Dun Dunbar. Saks Fifth Avenue.
Thank you.
-[Sophie] And for you, sir. -[Angus] Thanks.
[Helen] Beautiful! Thank you!
[chuckles] Rhona, that's gorgeous.
-[Helen] That's lovely. Oh, thank you. -Thank you.
Matches your hair. [laughs]
He'll take a second notion to me when I wear this.
What do you think? Is it me?
It is, isn't it?
Hamish! Hamish!
Hamish! Hamish! Hamish!
Hamish, here, give me that.
Don't. Give it to me.
-Give. Give it to me! -[growling]
-[exhales] -What are you doing?
-I'm sorry. -[Hamish cries]
I found this. I thought… maybe I could wear it tomorrow night.
Unless it belonged to your mother or your grandmother.
You shouldn't be wearing that.
You're mad at me over a dress?
No. No.
I'm mad at myself.
Why?
I'm mad at myself too.
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.
We, uh,
we shouldn't be doing this.
No.
No.
We definitely should not be doing this.
Merry Christmas, Angus.
-Good morning. -[Thomas] Yeah.
And Merry Christmas Eve.
[chuckles] Is there anything I can do to help?
Absolutely nothing. This is my domain.
Okay.
Oh, how lovely.
-[Thomas chuckles] -Thank you, Thomas.
Good morning.
Good morning.
What's all this?
What does it look like? Breakfast.
-How very thoughtful of you. -Well, I am nothing if not that.
Ladies first.
Thank you.
Is there something else?
Uh, no, no, no.
That, uh, that about covers it.
[Thomas] Angus, come on.
Let's leave these two lovebirds alone.
You do realize the whole village will know within the hour?
Know what?
That we're, um…
-What are we? -Maybe we don't need a title.
Well, I am the Duke of Dunbar. Really?
You never mentioned that.
Don't tell me you're one of those people who likes snow on Christmas Eve?
[Myles] Come on, then.
Well, what's left now?
-You look like you wanna say something. -Not really.
Then I do.
-Do you have to? -[chuckles]
Look, I was thinking… [exhales]
…what happens after Christmas?
-Because I was thinking-- -You've been doing a lot of thinking.
-What are you thinking? -[laughs] I'm trying not to!
You could stay.
S… Stay?
-[chuckles] -At Dun Dunbar.
What? You mean you… [chuckles]
…you'd let me stay
in the place I've lived my whole life as a guest?
-No, as-- -As a what, then?
-As a tenant? -No.
Maybe as your boyfriend, then? Or Mr. Emma Gale? What's his name?
Um, Winston, wasn't it?
Aye. And we know what happened to him.
-What are you doing? -What am I doing?
You show up here,
buy my castle,
take over the place, take over my whole life,
and now you offer me a room in my own house!
I should never have let you in in the first place.
You don't get to walk away like that.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do I need your permission, Your Highness?
I can't believe I was starting to think we could be happy here.
-There's that "we" again. -Yeah, "we." That's right.
Two people who have just spent three months together.
I was doing just fine until you showed up!
-Were you? -Aye!
Oh, well, looks like you win, then.
Because this place is just gonna remind me of you.
The deal is off.
Enjoy your 12 empty bedrooms.
Leave the key on your way out.
Oh, you really are a royal ass.
You can't say I didn't warn you!
-[Hamish cries] -I'm gonna miss you, Hamish. Oh.
-Yeah, gonna miss you. -[Hamish cries]
Don't worry. I do it every day.
Oh, no.
Oh, Thomas.
[Thomas] Are you really just going to let her leave?
That was the plan.
Ugh. You and your stubborn Dunbar pride, eh?
Castles are meant to have walls around them. People aren't.
Without this castle, I have nothing.
And what good is this place without anyone in it?
My flight leaves tomorrow. I'll need a ride to Edinburgh.
-Oh. -Sophie, don't go.
You can come and visit me.
All of you. Anytime.
And don't worry about your land
because I'm paying off all of your mortgages.
Oh, now--
I'll work everything out when I get back.
Oh, Sophie, you can't do that.
Consider it a gift from Emma Gale.
[voice breaking] Your friendship… means the world to me.
I just made a mistake. That's all.
Loving someone is never a mistake.
Trust me on that.
[Helen] Angus!
I guess we'll be giving you your Christmas present now, then.
[clicks tongue] Thank you.
Oh, I just… I love it.
I really love it. [sobs]
Thank you.
Package from Thomas for you.
The dress.
In case you change your mind.
[Helen] Cheerio!
[Eamon] What's going on? Let's have a wee look here.
-[woman] Happy Christmas. -[man] Aye.
What's going on?
-She's dead. -Deed?
Buggered. That'll be that, aye?
-[spluttering] What are you doing? -We're going back.
To get another car?
To the pub. For a wee dram.
It's Christmas Eve.
He cannot be the only driver in town.
Edinburgh's two hours away, longer in the snow,
and everyone's going to the party.
Your party.
-Everyone? -Wasn't that the idea?
All right. I can borrow your car, and I will have it driven back.
When was the last time you drove a stick on the left-hand side of the road?
In a snowstorm?
It's not snowing anymore.
It is in Edinburgh. My husband just called me from the road.
What about you, Angus? Will you drive me to the airport?
Stay the night. Someone will get you out in the morning.
All right.
But I'm not going to that party.
You're just gonna spend Christmas Eve here alone?
I'm fine. You're not fine.
I will be.
Hey, honey, Lexi.
It's Mom. I just wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas.
You're probably at the wedding.
Hey, if she throws the bouquet, don't catch it.
Okay. I love you.
-[Rhona] Helen! -Merry Christmas.
-In we go. -Let's go in.
[Sophie] "But Winston wasn't dead."
"It was a coma brought on by his fall down the stairs."
[Sophie] "To her shock, it wasn't Winston whose body lay there."
"It was his twin brother, Myles."
Oh! Sophie! Sophie, I'm sorry!
Seriously?
Sophie!
-You eejit. -[horse snorts]
I'm an eejit.
-[Myles] All right, come on, then. -[horse whinnying]
I just didn't expect this.
Or you.
I… I've done things a certain way for a long time,
and to have someone come in and just… [exhales]
I guess it finally hit me that I'm losing the place.
But I'd rather lose Dun Dunbar…
than lose you.
You want a castle?
It's yours.
You wanna go back to America? I won't stop you.
But I can't promise I won't follow you.
Because I've fallen
hopelessly and pathetically in love with you.
Maybe just hopelessly.
I love you, too, you dobber.
-[Myles] Hm. -You're an eejit.
-I am, aren't I? -[laughs]
-Hi! -Lovely to see you. Have a great night.
-Tom. Cheers. -Where is he?
[scoffs] I… I don't know.
-Nice. -Ah!
-After you. -[Rhona] Catch you in there.
-Easy on that champagne. -[chuckles]
You're gonna have to do it for him.
No, I'm going to do something for myself.
Maisie,
would you do me the honor of a dance?
About time.
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I announce
the 12th Duke of Dunbar
and the Lady Sophie…
McGuinty!
-[Thomas] She's here. -Oh, good. Good.
[Myles] Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?
Until recently,
this place was as cold as the winds off the Firth of Forth.
Colder than that!
Thank you, Eamon.
I thought this castle was who I was.
Or maybe even all I was.
And then…
then, I met a lass who knocked me flat on my royal arse…
…and she taught me that we should be with the people we love on Christmas.
And I realize that you,
all of you here,
are the people I love.
You're my family.
And so from this Christmas on,
Dun Dunbar will throw a party to end all parties for the village.
[Myles] And now,
I am honored
to introduce
the granddaughter of Callum McGuinty,
who worked this land
and had stones enough to carve his name in this very castle.
Lexi! [gasps]
What are you doing here?
Myles got me a plane ticket.
Oh. What about your father's wedding?
Nah, I'll just go to the next one.
-[laughs] Oh! -[Eamon] Want a wee drinkie?
Thank you.
I'm learning.
Well, you did go to Oxford.
And Cambridge.
Oh, yes, of course.
And now, to the McGuintys.
-To the McGuintys. -[all] The McGuintys!
Oh, Rhona, you've excelled yourself.
-She made all of it. -Did she?
-She should have a shop. -Yeah, of course.
I'll pass them round.
-Have you had one of these? -Oh my lord!
-Rhona has gone mad. She is wonderful. -Now that is a work of art.
Angus! Wow!
Hamish!
[man] Go, Angus!
[Sophie] Well,
merry Christmas to you, Hamish.
[Sophie] All right, what do you think of this?
The Heart of a Warrior.
By Sophie McGuinty.
"In this day and age…
not everyone…
believes in happy endings."
"But I just might."
-Merry Christmas, Mom. -[inhales]
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
Good morning and Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas.
[Myles] Sophie, my dear…
I've got a wee present for you.
Oh, even from backstage.
Adam, don't forget to cue me. Okay, perfect. Thank you.
Are we shooting them on all three cameras?
You've gotta love that!
Congratulations, Sophie,
on your huge, new best seller, Heart of a Warrior.
-Thank you. It is so nice to be back. -[audience clapping]
Everybody feels that this is your best novel yet.
Oh! Oh, it's my best book yet. Guess we do get a happy ending.
-That's what people want. -Not that kind of a happy ending.
Since you were last here, it seems like your life has become a total fairy tale.
You bought a castle in Scotland, moved to Ireland… Scot-land.
-It's a new province. -It's near Disneyland.
-It's a little to the side. Yeah. -[Drew] Exactly.
Is it fair to say that you're going to become a duchess?
Uh… Wait, do we get married, or do you just… What?
-Wait, and also-- -He didn't even propose!
How are they navigating it?
-I know. -Five days a week. Know what I mean?
-I do. -[man speaks indistinctly]
I really do.
-Welcome back, Sophie… -[audience clapping]
…and a huge congratulations on your juggernaut best seller.
I also don't wanna say the word  "juggernaut."
No, no, it was funny that she came out with that, with her head and her brain.
"Juggernaut" is a very harsh, male, masculine,
not sexy, pretty, feminine, soft word.
[woman] It surprised me.
…best seller, Heart of a Warrior.
-[audience clapping] -[Sophie] Thank you.
There was somebody in Connecticut,
a gentleman by the name of Jimmy Galante,
who was putting a hockey team in Danbury.
There were rumors the guy did things for Danbury
like you can't believe.
He helped with roads, he helped with schools…
[woman] By the generosity of the Galante family.
[Richard] Donated to the hospital for research.
Paid for all of it.
So, I wanted to kinda get to know the man.
I flew in.
Jimmy had somebody bring me to his office.
I'm going through the front gate, and you see this humongous, humongous operation.
Fifty, sixty, seventy large trash trucks,
and then these big warehouses.
I'm thinking to myself, "Where… Where am I going?"
Walk into Jimmy's office.
Yeah, and you know, a nice guy. Funny as hell. Great stories.
Funny as hell. Great stories.
We had a camaraderie and that good one-upmanship.
And then he showed me some race cars, trophies,
pictures with government officials,
tax returns, financials, bank statements.
I mean, he was just a real special guy.
Everything was going fine until everybody was excused.
And at that point,
he proceeded to tell me that he bought the hockey team
for his 17-year-old son who's a senior in high school.
And the second he walked in,
I was, like, dumbfounded.
[Richard] What was my first impression?
Looked like a punk.
He looked like a punk.
Got the big, big silver-and-gold chain.
He's got the diamond earrings.
Daddy bought his 17-year-old son his own hockey team,
and he gets to do whatever he wants with it.
I made it very clear to AJ.
If you do something to embarrass this league…
If you do something to embarrass your team…
If you do something to embarrass the game of hockey…
[man] Whoa! Holy shit!
-[laughs] -[Richard] …you're going to be dealt with.
So don't test me.
Because what you will find, you'll learn the hard way.
Dozens are charged in one of the biggest organized crime stings in years.
[newsman] Among the accused, a minor-league hockey team
and a convicted mobster.
-James Galante deserves prison. -[siren wailing]
[Richard] I'll never forget.
Jimmy kind of sat back in his chair, and he gave me a little bit of a glare.
[Richard] And AJ looked at me point blank,
and he said, "Mr. Brosal, you have nothing to worry about."
[T-Bone] It was like a scene out of Star Wars,
when Darth Vader comes through the door.
But that should have been fucking Jimmy.
Just a scary, scary person.
And I'm a pretty good judge of character, and, uh, I kinda took a liking to him.
-[Mike] When Jimmy came in… -[Drew laughs] [Mike] …I'm not kidding here, it made your whole body, like, nervous.
[Mike] …I'm not kidding here, it made your whole body, like, nervous.
Make your asshole pucker, man.
When that guy came in the locker room, you were fuckin'…
[stammers] You were shitting bricks.
[Rumun] Jimmy and I were on the phone, and he said,
"We're gonna kick ass this year, so I hope you're ready."
And I… And I kind of chuckled,
and Jimmy goes, "What are you laughing at?"
[chuckling] And I was like, "Uh, nothing!"
Over the phone, he had that presence.
First, we knew he had lots of money.
He was a really respected man,
but who you try to avoid all eye contact with him when he was mad.
[Mike] Just look at you with this nod, and you'd be like, "Fuck. Talk! Talk!"
Just kill us from the suspense.
I mean, are we gonna have cement skates?
[Drew] I mean, there was a lot of speculation about, obviously,
where Jimmy came from, what he did.
A lot of speculation, know what I mean?
You start to wonder.
But I sat down with Jimmy, he had a big photo mounted on the wall.
It's, uh, James Gandolfini. It's Tony Soprano!
And it's signed, "To Jimmy, uh, to the real Tony Soprano."
I've heard rumors that they based The Sopranos series off of this family.
You have Italians, a trash hauling business.
You have AJ and AJ.
All the guys that hung around Jimmy.
It's, uh…
It's pretty much spot-on.
[James] You know, I'm not an angel.
I've never been an angel.
And because of the publicity that I've gotten over the years,
a lot of people find me unapproachable.
There were a lot of things that went on, and, um…
let me just say, I can still look myself in the mirror every day.
I don't have a problem.
[James] I'm in the trash business.
Got to be a game with me.
I had one truck, had to have two trucks, then I had to have three trucks.
Next thing you know, you had 50 trucks,
400 employees.
It was the largest trash company on the East Coast.
It was hard, aggressive work.
We'd collect all of Northern Westchester County, New York,
Putnam County, New York, lower Dutchess, New York,
and the outskirts of Western Connecticut.
And it just took off.
That's all I'm gonna say on that.
-[camera clicks] -[James] Yes, I had a lot of money.
But a lot of people in life get fooled.
"This will bring you joy and happiness."
But for me,
it was my kids.
[James] Five minutes to eight on August 14th.
I can't explain it.
AJ, uh…
Love of my life.
Ready? You ready to go?
I'm gonna get you, little monster! Bubbles, you see?
Nice horsey.
[James] My father, Lord rest him, worked two jobs.
I barely got to see him.
-I'm happy. -You're happy?
I'm happy!
[James] And I said to myself, I wanna make sure I gave him a life…
…that was better than… than I had.
I couldn't ask for a better son.
[AJ] I always believed that I had a normal childhood.
Every summer of my life was at AWD, at his yard, in his office.
[James] How much did you guys extort today?
[AJ] I was seven years old,
in charge of bringing him his Dunkin' Donuts every day.
[James] AJ, you just extorted 50 cents from some poor slob.
My dad would bring me by the hand. "Meet this guy."
I've known these guys, and they treated me with such respect.
We'd be sitting all together, bullshitting.
Talking about life, girls, sports.
I really saw loyalty is everything, respect is everything.
But when I realized maybe I'm being raised differently than most kids…
But when I realized maybe I'm being raised differently than most kids… Second grade. Teacher's going around talking to the kids.
Second grade. Teacher's going around talking to the kids.
Like, "Hey, what's lessons you've learned? What have you been taught?"
Joey says, "Don't take candy from strangers."
Sam said, uh,
"Don't go into someone else's car if you don't know them."
I was, "You don't rat on anybody and you always be a stand-up guy."
That's the truth.
[AJ] I remember my birthday party.
Ten years old, and I was obsessed with wrestling.
I remember my dad saying, super casually,
"This year, we're bringing WWF superstars."
My heart… I was… My heart dropped.
[AJ] It was the most iconic figures in wrestling history.
My classmates just sitting there like, "What is going on?"
[party guest] It's Cal with the unhappy face.
[AJ] But then something happened in my life, and it was a very big turning point.
[AJ] The Mighty Ducks.
Well, that was the… the first start of it all.
My dad would always say, "You can't make it in life on your own.
You need a small group of people that can help you."
Remember what we learned. Ducks stick together, right?
[The Mighty Ducks] Yeah!
[announcer] He shoots, he scores!
And I remember being like, "Holy shit!"
In the middle of the movie, I knew I wanted to play hockey.
[James] Listen, I don't wanna say I was disappointed.
You know, I tried to push him towards football.
But, um, didn't work.
Somehow hockey… He says, "I wanna be a hockey player."
Be careful.
-Be careful. -[screams]
[James] You like that, eh?
I don't like it, Dad, I love it!
[James] Next thing you know,
we're out all hours of the day and night bringing him to the rink.
Oh, yes! [hums]
He fell in love with it.
[AJ] For my father and I,
it was the best thing that ever happened to us.
Everything was just so perfect.
[Ed] I started with the FBI back in 1976.
Worked organized crime, the Mafia.
I'm a New Yorker, born and bred, so I didn't mind that.
My work was on John Gotti.
He was "Teflon Don" during those years.
It took a long time, and eventually we brought him to justice.
Crime boss John Gotti has been sentenced to life in prison with no parole.
[Ed] And, um, he held a little bit of a grudge on that one.
The Teflon is gone. The don is covered with Velcro.
[journalist] There are several other mob indictments believed to be imminent.
The Genovese family is said to be the next one
the federal prosecutors are working hard at bringing down.
[Ed] The Genovese family controlled the trash business forever.
It's an industry that, over the years,
happened to be associated with organized crime.
The private carting industry
has been controlled by the mob for decades,
using violence to kill the competition.
[newsman] And associates of Genovese crime families are profiting in New York and Connecticut.
[Ed] So in the late '90s,
Jimmy was a big target for the Connecticut FBI.
The government knows Jimmy got his start with Matty "The Horse,"
the capo in the Genovese family.
[newsman] When Matty "The Horse" Ianniello was turning over money,
the FBI was watching.
And if they could ever get Jimmy to sell out Matty,
that's like taking down John Gotti.
So back in '99, the FBI jammed up Jimmy.
Tax fraud.
[Ed] The bureau wanted to send a message.
You could lose everything.
And that was the beginning of the story.
[AJ] The summer going into eighth grade, my father sat me down.
He said, "I have to have a talk with you."
-[AJ] Well, what is going on here? -AJ.
[AJ] I could tell in his face, this was different.
He said, "I screwed up. Got myself into a little bit of a jam.
And I have two options.
One, I could go to trial.
But if I don't win,
I might have to go away for seven, eight, nine years.
Or I can make a deal with the government
and I'd only have to go away for about a year."
I was like, "Take the year. As long as you're not ratting on anyone, take the year!"
He says, "I'm sorry I'm gonna miss your eighth-grade year, your eighth-grade graduation,
but I'll be back when you go to high school."
My heart sunk into the pit of my stomach, and he left, and…
He… He was… He was on his way.
[announcer] Anthony James Galante.
[AJ] When my father went to prison, everything just went to pieces.
But, you know, I gotta be there for my mom, and…
I'm the man of the house now.
-[AJ] Say hi to Dad. -Hi, Dad.
-[AJ] Give him a kiss. -[kisses]
[AJ] We all say Merry Christmas.
This is what the tree looks like.
All right. Say goodbye to Daddy.
[AJ] Just… It just was a tough transition.
In high school, they're talking shit in the bathroom.
"Aw, you saw AJ? He's such a little daddy's boy."
It affected me.
I had to prove that I'm not a punk.
[AJ] Now I was a bad guy.
The scumbag that turned on the good guy.
[woman] Jesus, AJ!
Oh, AJ. We are gonna have a match.
[AJ] I loved being booed. Fans were giving me the finger.
[man] Watch it, Galante!
You know, "Fuck you, buddy!" And I was just loving it.
Hockey, wrestling…
[boy] Oh my goodness!
It was a place for me to show I belonged.
[James] Well, I got out,
and I would come and watch him play.
I was never a big hockey fan,
but I gotta be honest with you,
I was…
amazed
at the fact that he was that tough.
Truthfully, I started to like it.
As a matter of fact, I was in awe.
I was very, very proud of him.
Senior year, there was a fast kid, he was coming down the boards,
and I laid this kid clean spark out.
[AJ] Helmet popper.
Beautiful collision.
Felt no pain, just went down.
Tried to get up. Couldn't get up.
I, uh, went to surgery almost immediately.
You know, to this day, I don't even know the exact diagnosis of it.
I just knew it was fucked up.
[James] When they told him he'd never be able to play hockey again,
he was heartbroken.
Just like the ultimate… the ultimate deflation.
[James] I said, "Well, you know, let me give some thought to something."
I says, "You know, it may not be the end."
And that's when the brilliant idea of the Trashers began.
[AJ] A few days later, I'm walking in school.
Everyone's looking at me kinda awkwardly.
And I'm just like, "Fuck's going on?"
At this point, I feel like I'm high.
Then a teacher came up to me and was like, "Wow, AJ!
That's amazing. What's going on?"
[stammers] I was like, "What exactly are you talking about?"
He goes, "The team!"
And I go, "The team?"
"Yeah, it's all over the paper!"
I remember turning to the sports,
and it was "Pro hockey coming to Danbury."
All of a sudden, I'm reading and I'm reading,
and "James Galante purchased a franchise."
Keep going down, and "His 17-year-old son
will be the president and general manager of the team."
And I was just…
I just… [imitates explosion] My mind's just…
-[producer] Were you pumped? -I'm shitting my pants.
I'm shitting my pants.
On April 1st, 2004,
in front of a crowd of a hundred people
here at the Danbury Ice Arena,
the United Hockey League announced a new expansion franchise,
the Danbury Trashers.
The president would be 17-year-old AJ Galante.
I'm AJ Galante.
I'm the president of the Danbury Trashers, and I'm 17 years old.
I feel like the LeBron James of hockey all of a sudden.
And that was not an April Fool's joke.
[AJ] April 1st, our first press conference and our grand opening.
Now, I'm getting a little nervous.
NBC New York, ESPN, The New York Times came down.
And it's like, "Whoa, you know? That's big time."
[man] We're so excited to be here today.
And with that, I want to, uh, turn over the podium
to AJ Galante, president of the Danbury Trashers.
So, AJ, come on down.
[AJ] It kinda became really real to me then.
You know, I had to talk a little, which, you know, at the time, was tough for me.
Thank you.
Today is truly a great day.
But I did know it was very important to start with a splash.
You know, really start with a splash.
Right now, I guess, let's get right to the chase
and introduce our first player, our captain, our first signed name.
I think everyone knows the name well by now.
[AJ] We decided the first player had to be a big name
to jolt the hockey community in the Northeast.
It was a no-brainer.
We decided the first player had to be Gretzky.
It had to be Gretzky,
and that's really where it technically all began.
[producer] Which Gretzky?
Brent Gretzky.
We're just ecstatic to have him.
Everyone, Brent Gretzky.
[AJ] The younger brother of Wayne Gretzky?
The sportswriters ate it up.
It was like, "Okay, touché, Galantes." The game was on.
Hockey player Wayne Gretzky will always be regarded as the greatest.
In Connecticut, there is actually another Gretzky
trying to leave his mark on the game.
[newsman 1] No, it's not the great one. It's the next best one.
-Brent Gretzky! -[applause]
[newsman 2] One of Galante's roles as president has been developing the team's identity.
[AJ] I told the press, in terms of my vision, the whole idea of the Trashers,
it's all my loves in one big freak mix of things.
Pro wrestling…
…and The Mighty Ducks.
We could combine the two.
Naming a team is harder than it looks.
You gotta really think, and what better to keep it in-house?
My father's in the waste management business.
Why not the Trashers? It's a real gritty name.
We want that "bad-boy" image.
Hopefully the evil empire of the UHL.
[AJ] Growing up, my dad always rooted for the bad guys in the movies.
Whenever the bad guy would do something, he'd be like, "Yeah! Yeah!"
Because he was doing that, I started to do it.
[reporter] Is AJ as tough as he says he is?
Absolutely.
He's also my boss, so I have to say that.
We wanted to be the home for that 1% that cheered for the bad guys.
[Jeff] In the FBI office in New Haven,
if we have an undercover operation,
it's given a title or a code name.
In this case, they came up with the name Pail Rider,
a spin on the Clint Eastwood movie, spelled differently,
P-A-I-L instead of P-A-L-E,
uh, to relate to the trash, uh, dumpsters.
This was, at the time, and remains,
the largest investigation I've ever been a part of.
Galante employed the use of organized crime,
specifically the acting boss of the Genovese crime family,
to intimidate, threaten, and keep competition at bay.
At one point, Galante and others went after a competing truck driver,
kidnapped him at gunpoint, bound and gagged him,
and set the truck on fire.
-[siren wailing] -[Jeff] The message was very clear.
If you wanna operate in Connecticut, you're gonna do it by Galante's rules.
So we knew very well who Galante was,
and we were aware he was going to develop a team.
As far as Galante naming his teenage son the general manager,
that seemed consistent with Jimmy's personality.
He did what he wanted.
The Trashers was a significant development,
and we were monitoring that very carefully.
[AJ] I remembered my first day walking into my new job really, and…
I got very anxious 'cause I didn't really know what I was doing.
I didn't know the league, the types of players we were gonna deal with.
Look, the NHL is the pinnacle of professional hockey.
Then below them, you have us, the UHL.
So you're dealing with a lot of guys who've been up higher,
guys who've been lower.
I know you haven't played in a while…
[AJ] And I really needed someone to help me build this team.
And, uh, slowly,
a light bulb went off.
He was a Danbury legend.
More of a mystique.
And he was my secret weapon.
My middle-school coach.
I just remember this big guy on the ice,
taking the puck from us…
burying sixth and seventh graders into the boards.
Jesus Christ. I was like, "This guy is… is a little crazy."
Did I check kids into the boards when I was coaching them? Absolutely.
Cocaine's a hell of a drug.
[AJ] But Tommy knew the game.
He had been an equipment manager for all different minor-league teams,
and his knowledge was very valuable to us.
[T-Bone] I knew the product Jimmy and AJ wanted to put on the ice.
I told them, "I have a player for us
that's gonna turn this whole thing upside down."
I go into my bag and I pull out a picture of Brad Wingfield in an orange jumpsuit, handcuffed.
AJ goes, "What the fuck is this?"
I says,
"Last month he beat the shit out of six corrections officers."
He goes, "I want him."
Last count, I've had about 17 surgeries.
Broke both my legs. Tibias, fibulas.
Spiral fractures of the ankles. Cracked vertebrae in my back.
Disintegrated disc. Couple bulging discs on my upper neck.
Broken my hands. Nine broken noses.
I've lost my front teeth. 300 stitches in my face.
Um, you can see right there. Lost a finger.
So, you know, that's something that I lost playing hockey.
[AJ] Aside from Tommy,
really, the only resource I had was video games
and Google.
I just became a very big stat geek
and started finding, like, patterns.
Like, where guys were from, where they would go,
the types of teams they were.
Really look at the numbers, lines, assists, penalty minutes.
And finally, the patterns introduced me to my crown jewel.
A Minor League Hockey Legend,
One Eye Willy.
My dream was to reach the NHL one day,
but my first training camp, it's like a big nightmare.
There was a guy behind me, and his blade went high,
and it went under my visor and hit my eye.
Right away, I lost sight.
That injury ended my dream to play in the NHL.
[AJ] Okay, you got a guy with one eye,
he's on a shit team,
who knows he's never gonna go to the highest level of hockey.
Hey, perfect Danbury Trasher.
[One Eye Willy] One morning, my cell phone rang.
It's AJ from Danbury.
I was so happy
'cause I knew I was on my way for Danbury.
[James] He'd call me from school. "I got this guy. I got that guy. I got the other…"
Finally, I asked him, "AJ, please leave me alone.
Call Tommy Pomposello."
[AJ] Dealing with agents is one thing that's very tough.
It's kinda crazy.
Sometimes I feel like I got a better chance of contacting Bin Laden than some of these guys.
[AJ] One morning, I get a delivery.
One of the VHSs, it said, uh,
"Rumun Ndur, the Nigerian Nightmare."
So, just because of that name,
I was like, "I'mma plug this one in first."
-[commentator speaking indistinctly] -[AJ] Very WWF-ish.
[Rumun] I was the first Nigerian-born player to play in the NHL.
But growing up, having Nigerian parents, they didn't want me to play.
And when I was eight, my mom said you can do figure skating.
So I told her,
"If I'm doing figure skating, I'm wearing hockey skates."
But I really got a feel for the footwork,
and that helped me a lot when I was, uh, fighting later on.
[AJ] I end up going onto the hockey database. Found these two brothers.
All I kept thinking about was Slap Shot.
They have those twins. -[crowd cheering] -And they always seem to play together.
[Drew] Mike, get off your phone, you fucking moron.
No, you talk, and then I talk,
and then we don't talk when we're both talking.
I always interrupt him.
-Uh, yeah, no, obviously when we-- -[phone chimes]
-Sorry. -You fuckin' idiot, man!
-Go. I'll put it on fuckin' silent. Sorry. -You think?
[Mike] Since five years old,
we knew where each other was from day one.
He knew when to get the puck to me. I knew where his sweet spot was.
It was unbelievable.
T-Bone picks us up at the airport and says we're going to Jimmy's office.
We pull into a dump, and I'm like, "What the fuck?
We're at a dump?"
And then you finally walk into his office, and you're like, "Where am I?"
There's Jimmy sitting at his desk with his cowboy boots up.
Jimmy was in meeting with five big guys.
[stammering] And look scary guys.
We shake hands, and then, boom. "What did T-Bone offer ya?"
I'm like, I say this amount,
and he's like, "Fuck, I'll give ya X amount dollars more."
More than double what I was making in Roanoke.
I said, "That's a ridiculous number,
but if you offer my brother the same, we'll come play for you."
Throws ten grand out on the table in cash. "There's your signing bonus."
Pulls out a contract, slaps it down, and says, "Sign the contract."
I'm like, "Holy shit."
I've never had negotiations go that way in my life.
And, uh, of course, I said, "Okay, no problem. Thank you."
I turned around, and I said, "Mike,
we are, uh, Danbury Trashers, uh, from here on out."
So I looked at my wife and I said, "I guess we're coming to Danbury."
[Richard] I have a job to do,
and quite frankly, I don't make any apologies for it, okay?
None whatsoever.
My job as the commissioner is to make sure that not any one person
thinks that they're bigger than the league itself.
I don't give a fuck who you are.
And so, you do have to have somebody who's there to police.
Now, when they started this bad-boy image,
I called an emergency meeting with Tommy, AJ, Jimmy Galante.
But it was really AJ, okay? "We're gonna be bad.
We ain't taking shit from nobody, Commissioner."
"All right, well, that's great, but I'm telling you right now,
you're going down a slippery slope.
I was like, "Who the fuck is this guy?"
You know, he's a short guy. Bald and…
But I loved him immediately 'cause he was… he was a ball-breaker.
Meanwhile, I'm giggling under my breath, saying,
"This guy has no idea what's coming.
He has no idea who's sitting across the desk from him."
I forewarned them. Everything was gonna be done proper.
He was a minnow in a shark tank.
[AJ] Opening night, around five, they opened the doors,
and I-I felt this enormous wave of… of pressure.
Are people gonna really like this vision? This "bad boys of hockey."
[commentator] And we are live at Danbury Ice Arena.
Phil Giubileo with you, and this is Danbury Trashers hockey…
[Phil] Danbury, it's kinda blue-collar.
It didn't have a heck of a lot going on.
And this is the first professional team that the city of Danbury has,
so everyone was real excited to see
"Why is a 17-year-old and a mobster running a hockey team?"
[Brenda] We didn't know anything about hockey at all.
Sports didn't interest me one fucking bit.
But soon as you walk into it,
you're feeding off everyone else's anticipation.
It was a big night.
Senator Blumenthal was there.
The mayor was there, naturally.
State senator's up in the box.
[man] ♪ O'er the ramparts we watched ♪
♪ Were so gallantly… ♪
[Brad] I'm on the bench before the game even started.
T-Bone brings me a cell phone,
points up to Jimmy's box, and I look up.
Jimmy's got his cell phone just like this.
So I'm like, "Hello?"
And I said, "Brad.
The minute the puck drops,
drop your gloves."
[Brad] I remember the anthem going, and I'm just like,
"Let's fucking go. Who's fucking getting it?
Fuck you, coach. Send someone out here. I'm gonna fuck you up."
[announcer] Number 42, Brad Wingfield.
[Brad] Turn back to watch the face-off get dropped.
And the guy told me to go fuck myself.
I was like, "Whoa!"
[commentator] Wingfield back off, and they're gonna go right off the draw.
[AJ] The whole arena…
It just goes silent.
[commentator] Here come the gloves off. Helmets are off. They pull up their sleeves. It's Watson and Wingfield
They pull up their sleeves. It's Watson and Wingfield to start the game here in Danbury.
But it was go time. He just started whaling.
[scoffs] I think my mouth just dropped to my knees.
[commentator] Hickey and Shaw.
Big left to the face and another big right.
Then he's connecting with a series of rights.
They're just whaling away at each other right now. Big uppercut!
I hit this guy with a straight-right so hard that he stumbled back,
went down, fell down.
I'm like, "He's out."
[commentator] Wingfield, a big takedown!
Just three seconds into the opening period.
So I gave the point.
"There you go, Jimmy and AJ. I'm here to do my job."
And Jimmy stands up. He gave the Jimmy nod.
And the place went wild.
[James] Right after Wingfield's fight,
I felt it in my heart.
I said, "We've got something here."
For anybody to say that wasn't special or emotional,
they have no feeling whatsoever.
-[man cheers] -[AJ] When I heard the roar of the crowd, it was just like… I just…
All these feelings started coming into me, like…
I felt just such a relief.
[Greg] Place just went batshit crazy.
Blood all over the place. It was fucking mental.
It was a blast.
[AJ] We end up winning that game, and I was just like, "Boom. We got it."
[commentator] Skating away with a 6-3 win.
First game. Oh Jesus.
I happened to be in the arena.
Did I react to it right then and there?
No.
But after the game, made it really clear.
"AJ, if you condone this kind of action,
I will suspend you as a GM.
You won't be able to be in your own damn building. You want that?"
"Oh, it won't happen again, Mr. Brosal."
Eh, it did.
[commentator] He had his helmet popped off his head.
Players down on the ice,
and we have a big pileup of bodies.
Big left to the head on DePalma!
[T-Bone] We fucking dominated every night. We intimidated every night.
We're just fucking assassins.
[commentator] Big left to the head on DePalma!
That's a throw. Is he all right?
AJ and I, we tried to recreate what the Flyers had done in the '70s.
You get into somebody's chest, into their fucking heart, they're done.
This is gonna be my team's favorite place to stay.
[Drew] We had the mentality that we're gonna beat you,
but we're gonna beat the fuck out of you too.
And that was the mentality of Jimmy and AJ.
[Rumun] It was the gangster mentality.
We were family, and Jimmy was the boss.
When I got on the ice, he'd give you a look, and I understood.
[commentator] Big Rumun Ndur going at it. Christ, don't rip his head off!
[T-Bone] As long as they gave us everything they had on the ice,
we would give them everything off the ice.
So we got them top-of-the-line accommodations.
We're staying lakefront. Gated community.
This thing is massive.
I arranged for them to have the best restaurants in New York.
We're eating calamari, steak, $6,000 dinners.
No questions asked.
Jimmy wasn't shy to put money into his team.
Every player was getting paid under the table.
I'm supposed to say that or no?
It was in a nice little envelope, but it was, uh…
It was a nice little chunk of change.
You'd always get a Trasher check.
One or two other checks, and they were different every week.
It was incredible how many different companies I worked for.
Doesn't take a whole lot to figure out this being a mob operation.
[Drew] "I'll give you everything that you want,
and we need you to win."
[commentator] Mike Omicioli out in front. Score!
[Mike] One night, I scored the game-winner.
Jimmy came into the locker room.
10,000 cash on the floor. We're all like, "Let's go to the bar!"
[commentator] Danbury knocking off the top team in the UHL.
David-Alexandre Beauregard.
Twenty-seven goals. He does this with one eye.
Danbury, the first-place team in the UHL.
It wasn't that he won us over at all. It was just more that--
-I'll tell you how he won me over. -Let me finish.
He interrupts me every fucking time, this fucking guy.
♪ We're the very best at being bad ♪
[James] The newspaper would write op-eds that it was too violent
and the language was vulgar.
I gotta be honest with you.
I never really cared what anybody thought.
I wanted…
I wanted tough guys.
They knew what they had to do. They knew what our philosophy was.
And quite frankly, they gave it to me.
[Richard] You should never take the game of hockey
and say, "Hey, how can we turn it into a three-ring circus?"
You're making a mockery out of the game.
You're making a mockery of the league.
[crowd chanting] AJ! AJ! AJ!
[AJ] We were the scum of the earth to the purists of the hockey world. [crowd continues] AJ! AJ!
You don't wanna start that. I'll suspend you.
Just, ugh… [spits] disgusted with the Danbury Trashers.
But at that time, fighting, it was a major part of the game.
Yes, AJ. Fighting is part of the game.
Two fights, maybe three.
But eight?
[stammers] It just doesn't happen.
And so, guess what? I banned quite a few players.
[commentator] Wagner going after the bench.
He's trying to attack Coach Potvin!
[Richard] You manhandled a coach? You're gone.
[commentator] Pounding the crap out of somebody.
[Richard] Taking a two-handed baseball swing at a player? You're gone.
You go and slam a guy's head? You're gone.
Slashing, spearing, spitting, slew-footing.
[popping sound] You're gone.
But holy moly, the fans loved it.
[commentator] It is insanity here in Trasher town. Everybody on their feet.
She had seven martinis. She was drunk as fuck.
And here I am, screaming my head off.
"I'll fuckin' knock your goddamn blocks off!"
-That's the reason there's a seat belt. -That was fun!
-[whistle blows] -[Brad] You'd see guys knocked out cold.
They would bring a body bag, throw it over the boards.
They'd count the player out.
[crowd chanting] Body bag! Body bag!
Drew and I were on the bench. We were all like, "This is fucking crazy."
They were ruthless.
[commentator] Fans in Section 102 extra loud tonight.
Section 102 sat directly behind the visiting bench.
[commentator] Fans in Section 102 blaring the horn.
I mean, you're talking a whole nother stratosphere of crazy.
[commentator] Probably driving Marc Potvin crazy right now.
[commentator 2] It is loud.
[Richard] The second I walked in,
fans from the 102 section
were waiting for me.
[crowd chanting] Brosal sucks!
Their chants were vulgar, crude, beyond crude.
The things that came out of their mouths. You'd just curl your toes.
[crowd chanting] Brosal sucks!
"Brosal, go home! You bald fuck!"
But my biggest issue at that point, quite frankly, was Tommy Pomposello.
He will go down in history as the only
equipment manager that has ever been suspended
because of his actions.
Tommy, the next time you turn off the hot water in the opposing locker room,
you will get fined.
Commish, you know, I don't know.
I don't know what happened. This wasn't my doing.
He was hiding equipment.
Team shows up -and goalie doesn't have his goalie pads. -No comment.
-and goalie doesn't have his goalie pads. -No comment. -[producer] What about the goalie pads? -No comment.
-[producer] What about the goalie pads? -No comment.
[Richard] Supplying teams with towels to dry off that were thinner than a paper towel,
and leaving six of them for the entire team.
And they were doing shit like this every day.
Every day. Every day.
[crowd] Boo!
Every night was psychological warfare.
Welcome to the jungle indeed. We got Section 102 here.
We're two seconds into this game.
It's gonna be an interesting night.
It was like a fun house. Everywhere you went,
there was a possibility of something going wrong for you.
[Richard] They did it over and over and over again,
and I felt like I had been committed into a cuckoo farm.
-[crowd chanting] Sieve! Sieve! Sieve! -[horn blares]
[man] I got two words for you!
Suck it!
New kid in town. You guys are gonna get trashed.
So, I didn't have to be a rocket scientist to assume
that something bad was gonna happen.
[Jeff] I can tell you that the entire time the city of Danbury
was enjoying this, uh, newfound
entertainment venue and the Danbury Trashers,
the FBI and its partners were working behind the scenes,
covertly, in secret,
to develop this case against Galante.
Went to the Trashers games.
We were there undercover.
We conducted surveillance,
ingratiating with Galante and others involved in the criminal conspiracy,
and gathering evidence through conversation.
[Jeff] As far as the hockey games, it was very clear.
AJ and Jimmy wanted to establish themselves as having a certain enforcer-type reputation.
as having a certain enforcer-type reputation.
Uh, WWE meets Slap Shot.
And it was quite a show.
But the most prominent memory that I have
is all of the drama, the chaos
when Brad Wingfield's leg was broken
in a very violent way.
[AJ] Out of nowhere, I heard a pretzel rod. Just that snapping sound.
Just that snapping sound.
Just the most grotesque screaming that I've ever heard.
This scream like an animal in pain.
And Brad Wingfield is just kind of… just down.
And the rink just went completely silent.
[Brad] When you break your leg like that, you go into shock.
Josh Elzinga kicked my feet out while pulling my jersey back.
Unbelievably cheap and fucking dirty.
And I looked down at my feet.
Well, I got one foot pointing backwards,
so I knew everything's not okay down there.
[commentator] That's never a good sign.
Wingfield is clutching on for dear life, it seems.
This is a rough spot for the Trashers to be in.
When they put him on the stretcher, I grabbed his hand.
I said, "It's gonna be okay, big guy," and he nodded.
[T-Bone] Jimmy went into the locker room and challenged the team.
"That doesn't happen here.
What are you gonna do?"
[Rumun] Winger was a good buddy of mine, and, uh, I knew his career was done.
And, uh, obviously,
I did what I did after that.
And what happens?
A shit show.
[commentator] Now we're gonna have Tyler Willis and big Rumun Ndur going at it.
Willis getting pounded by Rumun Ndur. Rumun Ndur has him in a choke hold.
Big takedown! Big takedown!
I was trying to fight the bench or any player that would fight me.
[commentator] Attacking a guy on the bench.
Tom Ditzer took it right to the face from Rumun Ndur.
[Rumun] I remember I hit a guy,
and I could feel his teeth through his cheek, like, on my fist.
Just… Just the perfect connection.
[commentator] The big Nigerian Nightmare manhandling him right now.
[AJ] I start hearing a commotion.
I saw my father arguing with the referee, and I knew that wasn't a good sign.
[T-Bone] And the referee, piece of shit,
told Jimmy to go fuck himself.
Jimmy punched this guy right in his fucking face.
You don't tell Jimmy to go fuck himself.
[Richard] You get into a fight with an on-ice official.
Jimmy was fined a lot of money for his actions. Okay?
But what even made it worse is he got arrested.
I'm a very loyal individual.
It was personal for me.
I considered the team a family. That's how I see it.
For your owner to do that? It's not necessary, right?
So, pretty cool.
Very cool man.
[T-Bone] That Monday, some of the employees at the garbage plant,
they're trying to find out where Elzinga was from and where he lived.
[Brad] I'll never forget.
Jimmy came in and brought me a home address of Josh Elzinga.
Asked me what did we wanna do about it.
So, what did I wanna do?
Winger thought he was kidding. [laughs]
He thought he was kidding.
If Elzinga, you're listening, you little fucking rat,
you're lucky we kept it on the ice.
I wasn't concerned at all.
I knew I'd get to see him again.
[Jeff] There was a lot of media coverage
about an assault, reportedly by Galante,
of one of the UHL referees.
It seems very consistent with the power that he wielded.
At the FBI, there was a lot of discussion about it.
[Ed] The FBI was pissed off at the situation.
Jimmy's back.
Here he is. He's growing even bigger.
The owner of the Trashers, Mr. Jim Galante.
[Ed] The city of Danbury was in love with the hockey team,
and the Danbury paper covered 'em all the time.
And everybody's looking up to Jimmy Galante.
[announcer] Your favorite owner, Jimmy Galante.
We need everybody to sing along. Section 102.
Jim truly is a good friend,
and he also was, uh, named as Italian American of the Year.
[Ed] He's front and center, flashy, in your face, flaunting it,
and he's painted as a hero.
A superstar.
Big bad Jimmy.
But the government knows the real Jimmy Galante,
and we gotta take him down a notch.
[AJ] We lost Wingfield. He was the heart and soul of the team.
And lost Rumun Ndur to suspension.
A major fan favorite.
So my father was pissed.
[James] It was different after that.
It was us against the world, and, uh, it's just like we had something to prove.
Frankly, we wanted to shove it up their ass
by winning the Colonial Cup.
Bottom line, if we win a cup this year,
then all these naysayers will say what hockey geniuses we are.
[AJ] My father's come from nothing.
You have to have a certain aggression, a certain oomph,
to get to where you wanna get to.
I have a lot of that in me. I'm his blood.
Like everybody else that's around me, he's loyal, and I trust him.
And I remember he looked at me with those eyes, and he said,
"Get me a fucking goal scorer!" And he storms out of the suite.
Today, the National Hockey League canceled the whole season.
I have no choice but to announce
the formal cancellation of play for 2004-2005.
With TV ratings slipping
and fewer fans willing to pay high ticket prices,
a year of quiet ice couldn't come at a worse time.
The, uh, commissioner of the NHL announced that the season is totally canceled.
I start thinking, "Let's try to bring in NHL heavyweight legends,"
and out of nowhere, it just popped.
Wouldn't it be something if we brought in Mike Rupp?
In 2003, a year before the Trashers were even a thought,
we went to the Stanley Cup.
Yeah!
It happened literally right in front of me.
[commentator] Held in near side by Rupp.
My hairs are standing up. Rupp scored the Stanley Cup-clinching goal.
He wins the friggin' Stanley Cup.
-[commentator 1] Mike Rupp deflected it! -[commentator 2] Mike Rupp erupts again.
[commentator 3] You never know where heroes will come from in a game.
[AJ] Flash forward a year and a half,
I told my dad, "It's gotta be this guy, Mike Rupp.
It's been written. I need this guy."
I had no idea what I was getting into.
[reporter] Rupp, any thoughts on the lockout?
[Mike] My agent calls me. He goes, "I talked to the owner of the team, Jimmy.
He wants to pay you cash."
And I go, "What do you mean? What do you mean, cash?"
He goes, "No, like, he… He literally wants to give you
a duffel bag of cash."
I'm like, "Wait, what?"
[announcer] Number 16, Michael Rupp.
[Mike] But when I saw what AJ was working towards
and how bad that community wanted them to win,
I'm like, "All right, cool. Let's, uh… Let's see what happens here."
[commentator] …ahead to Rupp. He's got clearance. Out in front, and gets the shot. He scores!
Out in front, and gets the shot. He scores!
And Michael Rupp able to net his second in this first period…
Rupp was the cherry on top,
and my Trashers were finally complete.
We were booming, and we got hot quick.
[commentator] He's over the line to the left circle, and shoots and scores!
[Jeff] As the investigation widened,
the undercover was the key
to getting inside of this criminal conspiracy.
He opened the door for us.
And we were able to establish the very first wiretap
on Galietti's cell phone.
Richie Galietti, in his own right, was a very colorful character.
He was Galante's garbage sales manager.
Galietti also served as Scrappy, the Trashers' mascot,
Galietti also served as Scrappy, the Trashers' mascot, uh, in costume.
The trash can costume.
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, Scrappy!
[Jeff] But most importantly, Galietti spoke very freely
in support of the criminal conspiracy over the telephone.
[Scrappy] I will fucking take your motherfucking eyes out
if you wanna fuck around, okay?
Do not fuck Jimmy.
Trust me, I will fucking destroy you.
From there, we were able to initiate Title III wiretaps on other cell phones.
-[man] Hello? -[James] Hey. Hey.
You know that thing on Mill Plain Road?
[man] Yes.
[James] Tell the cocksucker that I said, quote, unquote,
"unless he wants a fucking nightmare, get that fucking thing out of there now."
[commentator] …up to the neutral zone,
up the middle of the line, up to the circle.
He walks in, shoots, and scores. Michael Rupp!
He walks in, shoots, and scores. Michael Rupp! And this crowd has erupted.
The Trashers have extended their record unbeaten streak.
[T-Bone] So here it is, NHL lockout,
and we got the hottest ticket in the world.
They were scalping tickets out front.
[man] Plenty of tickets, guys.
All of a sudden, Danbury, Connecticut, is on the map.
Who scalps tickets to a Minor League Hockey game?
With no end to the lockout in sight,
many NHL fans started looking around for alternatives.
[commentator] We welcome you to Hell, the self-described name
for the Danbury Ice Arena.
A packed house. This one could be a sellout.
I remember John Cena came down. And it's like, "Holy shit." Like… [chuckles]
We're doing it right now!
[announcer] The WWE US champion, John Cena!
[Richard] Oh my good god.
It's a couple hours before the game,
and there's 10,000 people lining up.
I just keep driving,
and there's a sea of Danbury Trasher jerseys.
Every night they were breaking attendance records.
[Richard] And then the buzz and notoriety AJ created for the league was, like, ridiculous.
The radio, the TV stations, and the newspapers.
[reporter] Minor League Hockey team, the Danbury Trashers…
Danbury Trashers.
[newswoman] Team President, AJ Galante.
[Richard] I'll never forget. My VP of Media Relations,
he said, "Hey, chief. Turn your TV on."
The United Hockey League's Danbury, Connecticut franchise
isn't your ordinary Minor League Hockey team.
[AJ] And I was shocked.
Growing up, I watched SportsCenter ten times a day.
And it was just… surreal.
Jimmy Galante and his son AJ bring a new perspective
to the traditional father-son bond.
So, you know, uh…
quite frankly, I was…
Actually, I was kinda blown away.
And believe it or not, uh, I gotta give credit to Section 102.
After just riding me unmerciful,
they actually convinced me to sit with them.
I grew to really respect
what AJ was trying to do and what he ultimately did.
He was making the league good.
[reporter] Four months ago, this facility was a local ice rink,
AJ, just a freshman in college.
Now, a whole franchise later, AJ's still a freshman in college,
just with a little more responsibility.
-[announcer] AJ Galante! -[crowd cheers]
And let's be honest, AJ built a pretty damn good team.
The team was good.
[Drew] We were winning 70% of the games,
so what he did, he was phenomenal at.
[commentator] Watson to Drew Omicioli. One-timer, and he scores!
Drew Omicioli…
[AJ] It's a hard, hard business. It's a 24-7 type of deal.
Twelve months, 365 days.
But all my life, I've known how lucky I've been, and, uh…
I owe it all to my dad, and I just don't wanna let him down.
You've got this 17-year-old kid who's doing interviews,
and he was just himself.
What you see is what you get.
He just kinda rolled with it.
[AJ] On a personal level, you know, I'm starting to really catch my stride.
School, home, Trashers.
It was the most electric thing I ever felt in my life.
[commentator] Morlang has another breakaway, coming up the middle, over the line.
And the shot! He scores!
One of the games, our purpose there was to secrete a geolocation device,
which enabled us to follow people or vehicles,
and we were able to do that successfully.
[Jeff] This investigation, we intercepted tens of thousands
of criminal conversations.
And so, it merited and begged, demanded a response by us.
I remember my father getting a phone call, and we were like, "What's going on?"
He said, "I have to go."
There's been a, uh, federal raid at his yard on White Street.
[Jeff] We searched that whole day, through the night,
and after daylight the next day.
We seized thousands of boxes of records.
At that point, the covert phase of our investigation's over,
and the subjects of our investigation know that we're investigating them.
[Richard] Jimmy called me.
First thing out of his mouth, "Commish, it's fucking bullshit."
"Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay."
I said, "Jimmy, you gotta keep me apprised of everything."
Jimmy came to our dressing room before practice,
and he show us, like, his face on the front page of the Danbury paper.
And Jimmy was laughing about it. [chuckles]
He treated it like sipping a cup of coffee.
"Hey, FBI's gonna investigate me?
Fuck it, let me deal with it."
[AJ] My dad told us,
"You can't sit and cry into your pillow.
You can't be a bully.
You can't talk all the talk and then not produce when it counts."
And the landmark game was Kalamazoo, Michigan,
the team that hurt Brad Wingfield.
[Brad] The doctor said, "That's a career-ending injury."
But I'll decide when I can't play hockey anymore, not the doctor.
I wanted to get back for Jimmy and AJ,
and to get back at Elzinga.
It's time to pay the piper, man.
[commentator] It's the biggest game of the season tonight.
[AJ] Everybody knew this is a pay-per-view event.
This is a bloodbath game.
[commentator] All the Section 102 regulars here in full force tonight.
Winger wants to go after Josh Elzinga.
[T-Bone] Preparing the boys, it was surreal.
It was guys that needed to have a smoke or a shot of whiskey before the game.
It was like preparing for an invasion on Beirut.
[AJ] My dad calls everyone into the locker room.
We had a TV, and I had made a motivational video.
And the guys are just…
pumped… pumped for this.
[male voice] I said, "Are you ready?"
AJ put on a film with all flames going around.
[laughs] And the whole team goes, "Yeah!"
[AJ] Yeah, Josh!
Look at that handsome guy. What a face!
[Brad] AJ, as a GM, he's down there trash-talking.
He's got his little fucking fight-cam going.
You can't really say too much to him,
or you're gonna fucking have to answer for that.
[AJ] Josh, come on! Can I get a smile?
Wingfield's already taped up. He's just…
rocking, rocking.
I actually had butterflies 'cause I was like, "This is gonna be bad."
[AJ] Elzinga's posted up in front of their goalie,
and I remember Wingfield like a shark, slowly gliding.
All of a sudden, he bit, and boom!
Cross-check right in the face, and it was on.
The feed "coincidentally" cut off,
so unless you were in the arena or ever saw my camcorder footage,
no one's seen that brawl.
[man] Holy shit!
During the fight, everything goes really quiet, and, um…
It's almost peaceful.
Everything just kinda slows down and goes into slow motion.
He had the nice long flow,
so I grabbed a handful of that and tried to drive his head into the ice.
[commentator] …in front of the Trasher's net,
and he is just pummeling him into submission.
Wingfield is punching with refs on his arm,
and it's like the refs are flying with the punches.
It was the most beautiful thing I've ever fucking seen.
Two warriors going at it, no shirts on.
[Brad] He finished in a pool of blood.
And suddenly, you can start to hear the roar of the crowd,
and you can look and see how excited everyone's faces are.
And the fight, just wow. Still blown away.
[crowd chanting] You suck!
Something I'll always cherish and remember for, uh, the rest of my life.
[commentator] The Trasher team huddling along the left side.
Everybody hugging, everybody happy. It's the Danbury Trashers…
Honestly, for me,
it was like winning the Colonial Cup.
There was no doubt that we deserved to win the championship.
To lose it at home… it just wasn't our time.
[commentator] Here comes Kalamazoo, and time runs out.
And the Colonial Cup is won by Kalamazoo.
But so many guys came up to me. "Hey, I gotta be back here next year."
"You gotta win it all next year." Um, that's all I kept hearing.
I told my dad, "We gotta finish this.
Next season is gonna be it. Let's get to work."
-[helicopter whirring] -[indistinct police radio chatter]
[AJ] I was in the transfer station on White Street,
just like any other normal Tuesday.
Cars, vans just start streamlining in,
and, um… [snaps fingers]  that'll wake you up quick.
[Richard] The Vice President of Hockey Operations called me.
He goes, "I need you to go to a quiet place."
I'm like, "Okay. What's going on?" He goes, "We have a major, major problem."
I said, "What's going on?" He said, "Danbury."
It sounds like something out of The Sopranos,
but this was no TV show.
Today, a decades-long scheme unfolded in real life.
Investigators say they've cracked one of the biggest schemes in the garbage business.
One of the biggest organized crime stings in years.
[reporter] It started early Friday morning.
Exclusive video of federal agents
raiding the New Fairfield house of Jimmy Galante.
Also arrested, the purported head of the Genovese crime family,
Matthew "The Horse" Ianniello.
Today, US Attorney Kevin O'Connor unsealing a 117-count indictment.
The waste industry in Connecticut, it's very clear, has been infiltrated,
we believe and we allege, by organized crime.
[Kevin] This was a big case, right in the aftermath of The Sopranos.
People just find, you know, burning trash trucks irresistible.
They are the muscle behind the threats of extortion and violence
for those who do not play by the rules.
[Kevin] The reality is we already had the big fish here.
There was really nobody beyond Ianniello and Galante,
so we were able to, really in one fell swoop,
take out the entire criminal organization.
But any time you drag a net across an ocean floor,
you get a lot more than whatever fish you're fishing for.
One of the people we indicted was the mayor of Waterbury.
And then we found our state senator had gone to Jimmy for help,
threatening to beat up the boyfriend of his daughter.
[reporter] Senator Lou DeLuca pleaded guilty to asking Galante
to rough up his granddaughter's husband.
I understand that I should not have become friendly
with someone who I believed to be on the fringes of organized crime.
Then we ended up catching a fish nobody expected to be under the water.
[reporter] The paper trail also led investigators to a Minor League Hockey team, the Danbury Trashers.
to a Minor League Hockey team, the Danbury Trashers.
Money laundering through hockey.
[Jeff] In this investigation,
we learned about the conspiracy to defraud the United Hockey League.
Galante paid players much more money than the league allowed.
According to the indictment, several of the hockey players
According to the indictment, several of the hockey players on the Danbury Trashers and their spouses
were placed on the payroll of trash-hauling companies
and got paid for no-show jobs.
[Jeff] Galante brought the uneven playing field
from the garbage company to a professional hockey league.
He tipped the scales in favor of the Trashers.
[Kevin] The issue was, this really wasn't his money to give.
It was money he was getting out of a business that he was running in a very illegal way.
And so, we could not allow that team to continue to operate.
It was just not a choice that we had.
[Kevin] As US Attorney, you don't do too many unpopular things.
That was pretty unpopular.
There were threats made against me, as a result of that, from hockey fans.
She started crying. I was so fucking pissed.
Think I could've put my fist through the wall.
Oh, I hate to see her cry for any reason.
It was… too tough for me.
The amount of, uh, pain that we were going through as a team.
We were heartsick when it unfolded.
My wife and I and our son, Jacob, packed up and just headed out.
So we weren't…
It just came really fast. The end was just, like, bang.
We're here to announce an extraordinarily significant legal action.
James Galante masterminded a trash-hauling empire.
He enriched himself,
and he financed a hockey team through his racketeering conspiracy.
James Galante deserves prison.
[Ed] Well, after the indictment,
I was actually retained by Jimmy to help the defense team.
It's not that unusual that an agent retires
and goes to the dark side, as some of my former colleagues would say.
I told him straight up, no bullshit.
The FBI always wanted Jimmy Galante.
"Back in '99, they didn't get what they wanted the first time,
and they wanna get you this time."
Ninety-three counts.
Jimmy was facing over a hundred years.
And I know for sure,
Jimmy did not give up any information
against Matty Ianniello.
But Jimmy was concerned if anybody was throwing him under the bus.
[James] Loyalty is…
You know, you just…
It's a great question. Loyalty to me…
What I've found in life
is that the people that you think will stick by you
don't.
And the people that you never in your wildest dreams
ever thought would stick by you did.
[Richard] I was picked up by the FBI,
flown in to…
…to New Haven…
to be sequestered and put in a room
that is maybe ten feet by ten feet,
and they start asking questions.
And they want me to basically tell them that I feared Jimmy Galante.
I can't tell you how many times, how many different ways.
"You had to have feared Jimmy Galante."
And every time, I said the same identical thing.
"The Jimmy I know is a very loving and caring man."
I have the utmost respect for Jimmy Galante,
as a man and as a person.
The one thing that Jimmy isn't, he's not a snitch.
How do you not admire somebody like that?
[reporter] The US attorney says the investigation is not over
and there will likely be more arrests.
With respect to this investigation, I wanna emphasize that it's a very active ongoing investigation.
I wanna emphasize that it's a very active ongoing investigation.
Uh, I will put it best by saying there is a good likelihood of additional charges.
[Ed] I told him, "They're not gonna stop." The FBI just keeps digging and digging.
[Ed] So they back Jimmy into a corner,
use some strong-arm tactics,
and leverage a relative.
AJ was a big part of the, uh, hockey team.
[AJ] When you start looking at the names on this indictment,
I'm a lot closer to my father than this guy.
And, you know, my name's on this.
Say they try to indict me,
use me as a pawn to get my father.
[Ed] Jimmy was very concerned about his son.
I told him this would be something that you really have to think about.
If you go to trial, is it worth the risk?
It became evident to us on the defense team that, uh,
try to get the best plea deal he can.
[producer] So when the federal prosecutor started looking at AJ,
um, at that point, did you still wanna fight this?
Well, you know, on advice of counsel, I'm not gonna answer
any questions pertaining to any of my cases.
What I will say is that I'm a firm believer in, uh…
"the sins of thy father,"
and I did not want my son
to be judged by their father's actions.
And I plead guilty to certain charges,
and I received 87 months,
uh, in a federal prison.
A guilty plea tonight from a man accused of using mob influence
to run a trash-hauling business in Connecticut.
James Galante pleaded guilty this morning in New Haven federal court.
He faces up to seven and a half years in prison
for racketeering and conspiracy convictions.
[AJ] After my father went away and the Trashers disbanded,
I wanted nothing to do with hockey, let alone the Trashers, and…
People always wanted to talk about it,
and I kinda rejected it, rejected it, rejected it.
So I worked for a heating-oil company,
driving trucks for nearly ten years.
Settled myself into kind of a boring life, which is all I wanted.
Um, I just went to work, did what I had to, come home.
But deep down, I just didn't feel purpose and meaning
because a lot of my success
has always been based on opportunities my father gave me.
Honestly, that made me wanna take a leap of faith.
That's when Champs Boxing Club was born.
It was the first thing I pursued on my own,
got on my own.
It's my thing.
I'm here all day, every day.
I watch over the fighters, I manage the pros,
and it took off from there.
[announcer] From Danbury, 26…
[AJ] My first fight was an ESPN telecast.
Every fan was booing us, throwing shit at us.
I was like, "Oh my God, I'm back."
[AJ] Sports Illustrated and ESPN called "Fight of the Year."
[commentator] This truly was the fight of the year. It went 12 rounds.
[announcer] Danbury, Connecticut.
A big night of boxing is on tap at Danbury Arena.
It's the first show ever for promoter AJ Galante.
Fight night in Danbury is May 30th.
[AJ] 2015, and, you know, I was thinking of my dad coming home.
Wouldn't it be something if, uh… if I ran a boxing show at the ice arena?
[AJ] This is something I've dreamed about for a long, longtime.
This is big for the city, big for me. It's big for my family.
[James] I got back out,
and I was gone for a long time, in a sad place.
It was hard to walk into the arena.
I didn't wanna draw any attention to myself.
I just came in like any other fan.
They're a little awkward.
They don't know what to say to you, and I understand it.
[AJ] I was running around that whole night.
My father and I didn't get to have five minutes
to kinda take in that… that experience,
which is sad, but it's the nature of it.
[James] The biggest problem that I had
is that I thought I could pick up where I left off,
not realizing…
they've moved on.
They still love you, but…
I missed out on ten years of their life.
[AJ] Since the Trashers folded,
we've never sat down and talked about the team,
which is strange because it was so much the fabric of our life for a while.
-[AJ] How are ya? -Love ya, big guy.
You know what I found here? Look at this.
[AJ] We didn't have a ceremonial goodbye for the Trashers.
Oh boy.
[AJ] But Section 102 is having a reunion in Danbury,
and they have no clue we're coming.
It's been 15 years,
so this was gonna be special.
[T-Bone] When I saw that Jimmy smile…
Give me a second. I just…
I hadn't had a lump in my throat like that in a long time.
He did his time, and he did it like a fucking man.
He did it like a Trasher.
Like a Danbury Trasher.
I got a story I just have to say.
Jimmy, AJ. Yeah, my wife started playing hockey.
I went out and got the goalie stuff. Been a goalie ever since.
It's in my will that I'm gonna be buried in my Trasher jersey.
How's that for being a fan? I'm not even bullshittin' you.
I should've brought the wills with us. That might be a little creepy.
Hey, a big shout-out to Section 102 of the infamous Danbury Trashers.
Hey, guys.
I just wanted to let you know, 14, 15 years later, in Las Vegas,
and I would be remiss if I didn't tell you,
good or bad, you'll forever be in my memories.
He's my best friend on earth.
This has been the best ride I've ever had in my life,
having my brother by my side.
After games, um…
-When we win-- -When we lost though…
-You fuckin' keep fuckin' interrupting me. -Sorry.
You know what? Fuck it.
-I'm not talking about it. Bye. -Sorry.
[Mike] Even nowadays, I could be outside of Madison Square Garden,
and someone will be like, "Rupper?
I remember you with the Trashers."
I'm like, "Wait, what?"
You know, like, I won a cup ten minutes down the road, too,
with the New Jersey Devils. [laughs]
[Brad] With Jimmy, never got a chance to say goodbye.
We thought it was gonna go on for years and years, and… it didn't.
That's someone I'd have liked to have kept around
and had in my life forever, for the rest of my life.
Like, just…
He's just an awesome guy.
Like, I love Jimmy.
[Jimmy] I heard you're looking for an ass-whooping.
[Jimmy] How you doing, big guy?
You look like you're gonna cry. What's the matter?
[Brad] I'm not really a crier, but maybe today.
[AJ] That night, people came up to me and told me stories about the Trashers
that is completely bullshit and wrong, but I'll never correct them.
I let them interpret the story how they felt it.
[AJ] And I started to actually appreciate the appreciation people had for the story.
I realized you can't hide from your past. You have to embrace it.
Storytelling 101. Good guy wins, bad guy loses.
The bad guy's not supposed to win, and we were the bad guys.
[AJ] The Trashers were two guys who wanted to raise hell and take over.
[commentator] Another big right to the head from Mirasty…
[AJ] We were renegades. We were rebels. We were outlaws.
[AJ] We were…
Call it the TBA, the Thug Basketball Association.
These guys never had to follow the rules. They are prima donna athletes.
I couldn't believe what was going on.
It was an iconic brawl.
Unprofessional.
Absolutely unprofessional.
It's hard to explain to people from suburban America.
Ron Artest just went nuts.
He does have psychological problems.
We ride together, fam!
Stephen Jackson deserved the most severe penalty.
I'm never talking about this shit again. Can you get that on camera?
It was way too much pressure for me. Way--
I felt I was trying to escape, to find any way to escape.
Pressure on the NBA to clean up its ranks,
send a message that these guys are not a bunch of thugs.
If you actually knew what happened,
you actually knew the effects that it had on everybody…
…you wouldn't even be asking questions.
I want the story out there. What happened? Go frame by frame.
[O'Neal] Show people all the footage.
Then when it's told, you make your own conclusion on what it is.
All right, all right, all right, I'm good. I can walk!
-Okay, fine. -I can walk!
Okay, all right.
We ride together, fam!
[O'Neal] Once we got to the locker room, I remember just sitting down,
and I sat there for a while, and I sat…
I literally sat in my uniform.
And my phone just vibrating. Like, it's going off.
And my phone just vibrating. Like, it's going off. My wife calling me, my mother, my brother, friends calling me.
I think I had over a hundred text messages.
My adrenaline's still pumping.
I'm just sitting there trying to calm down, man. Just trying to calm down. I'm still in fight mode.
Just trying to calm down. I'm still in fight mode.
In my head, I'm like, "You're done."
"There's no way-- you might not ever play again." "Start thinking about something else."
Thanks, I appreciate it.
[reporter] A stretcher taking away an injured fan.
An ambulance on the scene with flashing lights and victims inside.
This is what became of the Pistons-Pacers game
at the Palace of Auburn Hills.
But everyone's saying it's a black eye for Detroit
and pointing the finger at some particular Pacers players.
[O'Neal] When I got home,
I'm up all night looking at this.
[newswoman] We think there have to be special rules in these sports arenas,
and we think we have to have kid gloves and treat these zillion-dollar athletes
and we think we have to have kid gloves and treat these zillion-dollar athletes as if they're different and special.
Too many players in this league
whose actions and attitudes bespeak kind of a thug mentality.
[O'Neal] I just remember watching TV,
and now I'm thinking about all the work that I put in as a pro player
to get to the point I've gotten to.
Everything you worked for,
in a split moment. [snaps fingers]
Getting out of my position of how I grew up in Columbia, South Carolina
put me in a position to look at life differently.
They flew the Confederate flag on the state house
until as recently as three or four years ago.
You make decisions growing up because your environment is that.
Your environment states that's what you should be doing,
but basketball became that safe haven for me
to, you know, not go down the road that many do.
The National Basketball Association draft of new talent is coming up on Wednesday.
This year's crop is younger than ever.
[newsman] One high school senior, Jermaine O'Neal, thinks he's ready to play in the NBA.
[announcer] Jermaine O'Neal!
[newsman] O'Neal, an All-American from South Carolina,
has decided to try his luck in the draft.
[O'Neal] I knew it was time to make the jump to the NBA.
I'm the piece that can change the bloodline of my family,
that can break the chains of things
that have been going on over and over and over and over again. I'm that piece.
The Portland Trail Blazers select Jermaine O'Neal
from Eau Claire High School in South Carolina.
[O'Neal] I got drafted at 17, picked to the Portland Trail Blazers.
[O'Neal] You get an opportunity to play something
that many people just dream about doing at 17.
Right? Just started driving.
But I also remember the boos.
That was one of the things that really motivated me.
Because people were counting me out.
[commentator] And now Jermaine O'Neal…
[O'Neal] I remember the first time I played in an NBA game.
It's like living a dream.
There ain't nothing like walking into those NBA arenas.
Feeling that energy.
-That hate if you're opposing team. -[boos]
Or that incredible love if you're home team.
-[crowd cheering] -[commentator] Jermaine O'Neal!
I became the youngest player at the time to play an NBA game.
Now I'm going from being the best player on the court in high school
to being the fourth-best person at my position on my own team.
You never think about not playing. You just don't think about that.
Because if you do, you're a loser.
But it was like, "Damn, how dare you just not even give me a chance?"
I remember sitting at the end of the bench and tears in my eyes.
I was like, "Something gotta change."
Well, it was just a couple months ago when the Pacers lost to an O'Neal,
but this week, they gained one in Jermaine O'Neal.
When I got the call that I got traded from Portland to Indiana,
I was so excited. It was an opportunity to play with Reggie Miller.
[chanting] Reggie! Reggie! Reggie!
I'm a die-hard Reggie fan.
I'm here for Reggie. [laughs]
I come to the games because of Reggie. [chuckles]
[O'Neal] I know he's a true competitor. He's a legend.
I told them, "Look, put me right next to his locker.
I need to talk to him."
[commentator] Here's Reggie. Here's the shot!
[Miller] I played 18 years for the Indiana Pacers.
Indiana breathes basketball.
They live it.
So, me being a basketball junkie,
I was in heaven.
And I was fortunate that Donnie Walsh,
the president/general manager, took a chance on me.
Reggie was the guy that really put the Indiana Pacers
on a trajectory they had not been on before.
He really wanted to win
and did more than anybody anywhere in attempting to get the championship.
Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers is here.
He is one of the great basketball players in the NBA.
-Great to have you. Thanks for coming. -Thank you. My pleasure.
Is there more pressure on you this season because of the success of last season?
[Miller] I think so. Um…
I-I wanna win the championship.
That is… That is my big goal. We came very close last year.
[Miller] We got to the finals in 2000, and we lost to the Lakers.
[commentator] Jackson looking to throw it in against Shaq.
Reggie turns and puts it up.
Off the rim, and the Lakers are the NBA champions.
[newsman] We can't help but wonder, how many more chances
[newsman] We can't help but wonder, how many more chances for the magnificent Reggie Miller?
[Miller] That was my 14th year, and we had never won a championship.
Looking at all the contracts and the age, it was time for us to get younger,
and they made and pulled the plug in getting Jermaine.
[O'Neal] The first day when I got traded,
I was at Champps, downtown Indianapolis.
And I walked in, I heard, "That's the guy we traded Dale Davis for."
People were pissed.
They gutted the team.
I was 20 years old.
I've never been in a position to be a starter
every single night,
but I'm willing to sacrifice every single thing I got
for this opportunity.
100% certain that you guys won't be disappointed at all.
I think you'll be very, very happy the trade was made.
I can bring a lot to the table.
I think Jermaine was really dedicated to trying to prove he was one of the best players in the league.
to trying to prove he was one of the best players in the league.
And he handled himself off the court with that kind of confidence.
You know, he was kinda what the NBA wanted.
I was kinda thinking, not right away, but down the road,
I was kinda thinking, not right away, but down the road, maybe he could replace Reggie.
[Miller] He's definitely showing signs he'd carry this franchise,
and what I mean by that is not the numbers he does,
but I think the leadership he brings to a lot of the younger guys in here.
You have to outwork people. Like, you just gotta be a savage.
[Walsh] Jermaine, to me, was a very unusual player for then.
He can do a lot of big man things,
but he can also take people off the dribble, and he was very athletic.
[commentator] O'Neal with a gorgeous 360 spin on Vlade Divac. Wow!
[Miller] Jermaine was on the verge of becoming a superstar in our game.
And he was becoming the face of the Indiana Pacers.
[announcer] First-time NBA All-Star center Jermaine O'Neal.
Then I'm like, "Okay, I like it."
I didn't care about minutes or points.
I wanted all these young guys to do the bulk of the work.
I wanted to win a championship for Indiana.
That's what it was all about for me.
My main focus,
and it doesn't always take place in one year,
is get players that fit with each other.
[Artest] When I got traded to Indiana, I was on the bus going to the Miami game.
They said, "Don't get off the bus."
Uh, "You're traded."
And I remember… You know, I never listen. So, I got off the bus.
And they said, "Don't get on the court."
And I went on the court.
And they said, "Get off the court."
I said, "No," and I practiced for an hour.
[newsman] In their first meeting with the Indianapolis media today,
the newest members of the Indiana Pacers
expressed relief over getting out of Chicago.
[Artest] It feels good to be here after a couple of years in Chicago losing,
and, uh, it just was hard, you know. I just wanna bring that winning effort.
I didn't have a lot of trust with people
just because of things that I was going through and stuff.
For me, it's enemies. Everybody's an enemy to me, all the time.
But once we step on the court, I trust that.
[Miller] I remember the very first practice after the trade.
That practice, which was three hours,
I remember Jermaine coming up to me and was like,
I remember Jermaine coming up to me and was like, "I don't know if we've ever practiced this hard."
And I'm like, "You're right. I think this is gonna be good."
[O'Neal] Ron was probably the hardest worker that I've ever seen in my life.
I think he was probably the most talented defensive player
that we saw in an entire decade.
Ron is different.
But different isn't bad.
Different is just sometimes unique.
And Ron was unique in his talents.
[Walsh] I'd never seen anybody play as hard as he did.
He was a force out there.
When I step onto the court, I'm just 100% in.
Bring it to this. Bring it to this. Bring it to this.
Test me right here, it don't matter who. You could be the biggest gangster.
This is where we go. I'll die here.
[Miller] Every team needs a Ron Artest.
You need a guy that everyone's a little bit afraid of.
[commentator] Hammered out of bounds by Artest.
Now having words with Heat assistant coach Keith Askins.
Wrong guy to pick with is Artest.
You know, that's, uh, that's who he is.
Hell of a player, but he's gotta get that under control.
He would say to me, "Well, that's not fair. They shouldn't be able to do that."
I realized he's got an exaggerated idea of justice.
I just didn't like people. I always had a chip.
At the time, we had the best interior defender in Jermaine,
and we had the best perimeter defender in Ron.
It was poetry in motion at times when they were on the court.
After I shut you down, if you do beat me, then Jermaine will shut you down.
We were also loose cannons mentally. Yeah, me and Jermaine.
Jermaine's a loose cannon, but he kept it really tight.
[O'Neal] We had a lot of the same mentalities.
Dog, hard-nosed, we gonna go get you.
And we just kinda started blazing through teams.
The Indiana Pacers, they are rolling.
The Indiana Pacers have the best record in the NBA.
[newsman] Indiana Pacers, best team in the league.
[newsman 2] Indiana Pacers, the team to beat in the East right now.
You guys don't understand how good we were.
[O'Neal] We had the best record in the league the whole year.
Made it to the Eastern Conference Finals.
I look back at it now, and that was the series that ignited…
everything.
Detroit had incredible talent,
and we knew it was gonna be a tough scenario.
[Miller] We were the two best teams, defensively and offensively.
So I knew whoever won this was gonna win a championship.
That series, they pushed us to the limit.
In playoff basketball,
the margin of error is this small.
Everyone has the physical capabilities. It's…
[commentator 1] Whoa! Hamilton is fouled this time.
[commentator 2] Artest may be thrown out of the game, but it's definitely gonna be a flagrant.
[commentator 1] That's just not a good move.
[commentator 2] This is a huge play for them.
At this time in the game, you can't lose your cool.
It's just too crucial.
You can't foul at the wrong time
-and give your opponent an advantage. -[buzzer sounds]
[commentator] And for the first time in 14 years,
the Pistons go to the NBA Finals!
They're the 2004 Eastern Conference champions!
We lost game six in Detroit.
It's like somebody sticking a knife into you.
The flagrant foul that took place with Ron Artest, was that the difference in this game?
that took place with Ron Artest, was that the difference in this game?
Well, it certainly had an impact.
You know, it was a tough call.
Yeah, I just put my forearm up, you know what I'm saying? And, um…
I think, uh…
But the ref saw it. You know, he was, uh…
Losing to Detroit in the Conference, I remember.
Yeah. We should've went to the finals. We should've definitely won.
When we lose that series, who wins the championship?
[commentator] The Detroit Pistons have just shocked the Los Angeles Lakers.
They were mentally tougher than we were.
I'm like, "You guys!"
It was just frustrating.
[Artest] See you later. Love you.
Get out the garbage!
The next year, I knew something was wrong, like…
I knew something was definitely wrong and that I just needed to step back.
I said, "I want my retirement papers,"
and the Pacers said, "No, you gotta play." [chuckles]
"You're under contract six more years." [chuckles]
I felt like Ronnie was coming out with something like that every day.
One day he'd say, "I can't come to practice tomorrow. I gotta do my music."
As a man, you gotta be able to do what you want.
So if I decide to wanna leave the game or take a month off, I'm a grown man.
It doesn't make me crazy, you know, to wanna do something I wanna do.
If you're asking for time off at the beginning of the year…
I mean, dude, we got six and a half months left, and you're asking for a timeout now?
I still got my album coming out November 23rd,
and after the album comes out, I'm gonna, uh, you know, make sure all my time is focused on winning the championship.
you know, make sure all my time is focused on winning the championship.
I had so much anxiety all the time.
You get that heart pumping.
It was something I couldn't control at that time. It was every day. Every day.
So, I was like, "I really do need to try to figure out what's wrong."
"Why are you not happy around basketball and your teammates?"
"Why are you not happy? Figure it out, figure it out."
I was already in therapy, but you don't get better overnight.
You know, we knew he had a psychiatrist that… that traveled everywhere we went.
We knew he had sessions that he had to have with her.
We knew that much,
but we were never, ever, you know, told that he had a certain issue,
but we were never, ever, you know, told that he had a certain issue, medical issue.
I had depression and anxiety.
I would be depressed about certain things and have anxiety about future things.
Some people have control over their emotions. I don't.
If really I'm excited, happy, I've just dunked on somebody, game-winner,
that emotional level is not a good place for me.
Positively or negatively, you have no control of that.
Come on! The fuck you all doing?
I'm not gonna do this with you! Come on, my nigga!
Get your motherfucking security right!
[man] We got a fight back here.
[man 2] You gotta chill.
At times, Ron could be a little edgy.
And the dynamic between Jermaine and Ron was unsettling.
I think the final straw for us
was when he said he had a death in his family
and went to the Source Awards.
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the Tru Warier
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the Tru Warier Ron Artest and Petey Pablo!
You were saying you were going away for a funeral, then three or four days later,
we turn the TV on and you're presenting an award at an award show,
and we ain't seen you in three or four days.
And the winner is… I don't know what I'm doing up here. It's all good though.
I felt I was trying to escape.
I was trying to find any way to escape. Definitely.
I'm not gonna answer any more questions about Ron.
Ron doesn't wanna be here. Ron doesn't matter anymore.
It's about the Pacers, the players that suit up every single day.
I'm tired of answering questions about Ron.
I'm pleading with these guys.
"Get on the same page!"
I could not get them to understand the opportunity.
[Artest] I never listened to Reggie.
So any time he's, like, giving me leadership and mentorship,
I'm thinking, "Bust his ass in practice."
I know that we're putting together
young guys who could rub each other wrong,
but, you know, I really wanted to win,
and I was looking for one final piece of the team.
And that's why I made the trade for Stephen.
[Jackson] I remember getting that call from Donnie Walsh and Larry Bird.
I had to put 'em on speakerphone 'cause I'm on the block.
I'm on 3200 with all my homeboys.
"Welcome to the Indiana Pacers," duh-duh-duh.
You know, it was a great moment.
When he said, "Welcome to…" all my homeboys get to running. Just, "Oh!"
And I knew the opportunity was… was priceless.
[Miller] When Stephen came,
it was the best thing for us, because now we got Jermaine, Ron,
and now you're bringing in another tough, somewhat crazy dude in Stephen Jackson.
Everything has to come through Indiana. There's no secret.
They gotta come through us to get to where they wanna be.
And I-I-I think we're the team to beat.
We have all the pieces. We gotta put 'em together.
[reporter] A challenge you relish.
Yeah. I'm ready for a challenge. That's what I live for.
-I make love to pressure. -[laughs] That's what I do.
Me and him was, like, we both kinda street.
So we're arguing about who's gonna guard the best guy,
like, almost come to blows.
Then I'm like, "All right, Steve, you got it."
So I'm like, "This guy is crazy!" [laughs]
We got a lot of similarities, but we're totally different.
I knew he was a little off. You know what I mean?
But he was a hell of a basketball player.
And that's all… I didn't judge nothing else but that. I didn't care. I was weird. I did my own thing. I smoked weed all day.
I didn't care. I was weird. I did my own thing. I smoked weed all day.
Guys like me and Ron, we look at basketball as our life.
This is all we can do. God gave me this gift to help my family, to get out of the situation I was in.
[O'Neal] Jack is a very aggressive person. We have a lot of similar traits.
He would turn that volume up very quickly and tell you about it.
He's down for the cause.
I'm a loyal guy. Like, one thing about it. If I'm with you, I'm with you, you know.
We shoot this, and we go to a bar afterwards, somebody say something,
I'll be the first one to stand up. That's how I am.
If I'm with you, I'm with you. I was the missing piece.
That's basically what they were saying.
I was the missing piece to the championship team.
[Miller] There's only a handful of teams that can say,
"We have a shot to win the championship." Out of my 18 years,
that season, we were loaded for bear.
This was our year.
[commentator] This is the Showdown of the East we've been waiting for.
A rivalry that's been brewing long before this season ever started.
Two teams, similar styles, only one survivor.
[Artest] Going into the Palace, we was already seven and two.
I knew that was the game I wanted more than any game.
But I didn't know what was gonna actually happen.
We were coming in there to make a statement.
"Yeah, y'all got the chip, but we're letting y'all know
y'all gonna be seeing us this year."
-Where we from? -[all] Detroit!
-Where we from? -[all] Detroit!
Detroit was one of the hardest places to play. They don't make it easy for you.
Obviously, um, you know, we're facing a tough challenge
going into a… uh, going into the Palace.
They have a rabid fan base.
Very faithful and admiring fans.
Um, and very boisterous at times.
Yeah! Number one, baby! Number one! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!
The fans were a huge part of a lot of the success,
because even though you're on the court, you can hear those fans going crazy.
When we would come into the gym, we knew the Pistons were gonna win.
We just didn't know by how much.
Any time you put 20,000 people together for four or five hours,
and they're drinking,
the stage is set. Somewhere, somebody's gonna have an issue.
There was a couple of guys that we were gonna remove their season tickets.
We kinda had enough of their, uh, shenanigans.
It was a Friday night. We didn't have to work Saturday,
so it was kinda like, you know, you kind of enjoyed it more.
Have a few drinks, hang out with friends. Kinda like treating myself.
Charlie's a fan. Uh, he was a season ticket holder.
And he had issues that night. And so, we were…
And he had issues that night. And so, we were… going to address it with him that we were taking away his season tickets that night.
going to address it with him that we were taking away his season tickets that night.
We would normally probably work the Pistons games two, three times a month.
On that day, we were assigned on the east side.
I think we had some rivalry with Indiana, I think, as well,
and the crowds were pretty charged up.
Everybody in the NBA wants one of these.
This is what they play for, a championship ring.
[Gray] I was there to broadcast the game for ESPN.
Indiana was a terrific team.
They were championship contenders
and may have, at that time, been the best team in the NBA.
But Detroit was a good team.
They were a really good team.
[Miller] I had broke my finger, so I was in a cast. Stephen was moved to the shooting guard.
I didn't know the magnitude of the rivalry that I was walking into.
You gotta thing, they was wrestling with this team all last year
in the Eastern Conference Finals, about to go to blows.
It was absolutely a statement game for us.
This is our moment, and let's leave no doubt.
[Wallace] They felt that was their year,
and we felt like we had to defend our title.
I remember that night. The Palace was electrifying.
Man, it was… It was almost like having an out-of-body experience.
You could feel the hair stand up on the back of your neck.
[Donaghy] Whenever you go into a nationally televised game,
there's a different roar in the arena. There's more lights. There's more cameras.
You know, they're real careful who gets assigned games like that
because they want not to be embarrassed as a league.
Nobody liked refereeing the Pistons back then.
You knew you were in for a rough night.
When you have Ben Wallace, Stephen Jackson, Ron Artest,
I mean, that's just a recipe for disaster right there.
Basketball fans from around the great state of Michigan,
and those of you here at the Palace from across the world,
stay on your feet.
-["The Final Countdown" playing] -Time to meet and greet the ballers
representing the D… troit Pistons!
[O'Neal] They had the most dynamic announcer. Right?
And it gasses you, where you saying, "Look, I'm at your ass today, Detroit."
[announcer] At 6'9", the center, wearing the big red three,
B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-Ben [trills lips] Wallace!
I remember they did the Ben Wallace introduction. That got me hyped.
I remember they did the Ben Wallace introduction. That got me hyped. That got me hyped. Like, "Let's bust they ass. Fuck that."
At the time, I didn't know Ben Wallace lost his brother.
Having that energy, you know, it was…
I knew I couldn't put that energy nowhere else but into basketball.
It was like a powder keg.
[commentator 1] A fun matchup to watch during the regular season.
We can only hope they'll meet again in the playoffs.
Pistons so far perfect at home. Another packed house at the Palace.
Going into that game, I thought we could beat Detroit,
and I wanted to see if this type of team would work.
[commentator 2] O'Neal.
[commentator 1] Artest steps back… Oh, what a quarter for Ron Artest.
Four-tenths of a…
Even though at that time I was struggling, I was playing great.
The game was a beatdown. We dominated from beginning to end.
-Ron dominated. Nobody couldn't stop him. -[whistle blows]
Two, three, four guards couldn't guard Ron at the time.
He was too agile. He was definitely the best player on the court.
We were up double digits, and my young boys were jawing.
They were clicking.
Ron and Jermaine.
It's good Ron, and it's good Jermaine.
It was fantastic.
This is our moment. It's our coming-out party.
We came in with a different type of swag.
Stephen's like… he's so clutch.
I'm like, "Wow, this guy makes every big shot."
We knew right away we was the best team.
We were kicking their ass.
They put a championship team together. It was obvious.
'Cause we were beating them down,
the normal ticket holders were gone.
They had left.
So it was the people that were trickling their way down
that were probably already liquored up, coming on down to fill those seats.
Oh, man, very disrespectful, like, the way they did it. The game was almost over. They had starters out there playing.
The game was almost over. They had starters out there playing.
They were up by 15, 20 points.
[commentator] Oh! Wallace with a terrific block!
That's not a foul.
At the end of the game, we're up by 15. In my mind, the game's over.
Jamaal Tinsley tells Ron,
"You can get your foul now." Ron looked at him like, "Huh?"
"You can get your foul now."
You got your foul. You can go now, right? All right?
Why are you even telling him that?
Ron doesn't need a battery in his back to do something crazy.
[commentator] Artest with 24, O'Neal at 20,
Croshere 15, Tinsley 13.
[Jackson] As we're running back, I guard Ben. When they throw him the ball, I'm not gonna try to play defense on him.
When they throw him the ball, I'm not gonna try to play defense on him. I'm not even gonna try to foul him.
-[Artest] He was going for a layup. -[commentator] Oh!
I didn't want him to get the layup, so I pushed him.
It was too hard of a foul at that point in time during the game.
[commentator] Oh, Wallace! Right at Artest!
This has potential to be serious if they don't get between them.
Wallace upset. Players trying to hold each other off.
Stephen Jackson, and we see Wallace trying to be peacemaker.
Now Jackson yelling…
[Miller] The dust-up I have no problem with.
That happens all the time. The pushing, the shoving…
You know, that's all fake.
Most of the time, nobody in the NBA wanna fight.
It has to be real disrespectful shit for somebody to throw punches.
Where it all turned
is when Ron went and laid on the scorer's table.
Went over and laid down, which is not normal.
It's not normal to lay down on the scorer's table.
That's crazy, too, you know?
That's… That's… That's almost worse than the foul.
[Artest] I was already in therapy. So I was practicing in real time.
One thing was take five, right?
So if something happens, you're like, "One, two, three…"
Before you do anything, just count, 'cause then you get more time to think.
[Artest] My team was all around me.
It was funny 'cause I felt like I was a big dog, like…
I did feel like my team got… I know my team,
so I know, like, Jermaine's not gonna just let Ben come over and touch me.
I know that for a fact. Like, I got Steve Jackson.
I'm like, "All right, Cool. I don't need to do nothing. I'm fine."
[commentator] Wallace is still charged up.
Now, Wallace, I would assume, has been ejected.
Ben wore, like, 10,000 armbands and headbands and wrist bands,
and he started throwing things.
[Donaghy] Saw him throwing the headband and the wristbands.
He definitely was losing his temper.
The fans don't know the majority of us are actually friends,
so they think that this is a real street brawl scenario.
So however you react, they're gonna react.
If you do this, what do you think they gonna do?
If you do this, what do you think they gonna do?
The crowd feeds off the players.
Out of the corner of my eye,
I see it coming.
Super slo-mo. Like, it just…
It just… Everybody was supposed to see it. That's how slow it went.
[Miller] Bam!
[commentator] Now Artest has jumped over the scorer's table
and is trying to get down to the bench!
Artest is in the stands!
Oh, this is awful. Fans are getting involved.
Once I saw him go, I went.
He needed aid.
As I get to him, another beer is thrown in his face. And that's the guy I…
[commentator] Stephen Jackson's in the fans.
The security trying to somehow restore order.
Fans and players are going at it! The players trying to help each other out!
Rasheed Wallace going into the stands!
[commentator] This is a disgrace.
All the players, they're jumping in there to try and get the other players out
because the fans have become involved.
[commentator] Oh, what a sad scene here at the Palace.
[Artest] Walking down the stands, I'm thinking, "It's good."
I didn't think anything else was gonna happen at all.
I thought it was gonna be over.
[O'Neal] I just stopped and paused, and I just started looking.
"Where is the security at?"
There was no police. I didn't see a policeman in the building.
I didn't see any security. There was nobody there to stop this.
Everybody was everywhere. I mean, it was just like a melee.
And then, they were pushing us towards the exit.
Somehow, I got on the court.
I remember being shocked, like I'd seen an alien, like…
"This guy, uh, coming to the court to fight?"
'Cause at that point, I'm fed up. I'm trying not to fight, but these guys are giving me a reason…
I'm trying not to fight, but these guys are giving me a reason… This is my comfort zone.
You wouldn't in your right mind walk down on the court and think it's a good idea
You wouldn't in your right mind walk down on the court and think it's a good idea to take on Ron Artest after he's been in the stands.
[commentator] Oh, what a sad scene here at the Palace.
[commentator] Now another fight's breaking out in front of the Pistons bench.
It's a fan. This is very, very dangerous.
Fans are throwing…
I didn't see him coming at all. Sucker punched me.
You know, quite a…
bitch move, tell you the truth.
I just all-out sprint over there to try to help him.
[Miller] He slipped. Thank God.
It was the best miss of Jermaine's career.
'Cause if Jemaine would've connected on that punch…
…that fan would have been dead.
[commentator] …now onto the court.
Ron Artest has a look in his eye that's very scary right now.
The scariest moment was once I realized how out of control this got
and how much further it's gonna go.
At the time, we had three officers on the court.
Not the best odds against 20,000 people.
It was out of control.
That's why the decision was we need to get the players off the court.
If we get them off the court, the fans will calm down.
[Miller] An officer runs up from behind me,
and he has his mace thing out,
and he's getting ready to mace Ron.
I had no intention of spraying Ron Artest. He was already down on the floor.
He had… He looked wore out.
At some point, I ran across Reggie Miller in a suit.
And I… At the time, I didn't know he was Reggie Miller or a player
'cause he was in a suit. I'm asking him what is he doing.
How you not know Reggie Miller's on the Indiana Pacers?
[Miller] I grabbed the officer. Like, "What are you doing?"
I was like, "Go get all these people off the court. Don't be macing him."
That's when I really got pissed off.
Like, y'all are not trying to help us. It's really 15 against 30,000.
[commentator] They're trying to get the Pacers to go back to the locker room.
[Miller] We all grab Ron, and we start to run.
[O'Neal] You see everybody merge to one area.
And they throwing everything they can get their hands on.
[commentator] Now these ridiculous fans trying to go at the players and throwing…
[commentator] Somebody could really get hurt.
[commentator] This is a bad showing from the Pistons fans.
Just firing bottles from the stairs.
All right, I'm good.
-I can walk! I can walk! -Okay!
We ride together, fam!
I remember saying to the camera, "We ride together."
We gonna always ride together. That was my attitude.
I was happy that I helped my brother down.
I was happy I was able to come to my brother's aid.
You can see that in my face in the locker room.
I was happy with what we did. I was there for my brother. Yes!
-[reporter] Tell me your name, sir. -Charlie Haddad.
He hit me in the face. I'm still hurt. I need X-rays on my whole face.
I don't even know what's going on.
You gotta stop, you gotta stop.
[man] Take it outside. You can't be in here.
After I get hit, we left and went through a different room,
like they were protecting me.
They started bringing people into my office.
A couple of them were like, "This would be funny
if one of us, you know, hurt ourselves and we can sue."
I remember looking. I see people rocking chairs, trying to get the chairs loose.
The arena closed in on us very quick.
The crowd was getting a little bit, um, out of control.
Somebody easily could grab your weapon.
[O'Neal] Then, all of a sudden, I saw the chair up in the air.
People were trying to hurt me and others.
It was just a horrible, horrible scene.
[Miller] We get to the locker room, and slowly but surely,
everyone was starting to filter in with their own stories.
The whole time, I'm like, "Jermaine is gonna kick my butt."
The whole time.
I didn't wanna see him.
I knew he was gonna be pissed. It's all about winning for Jermaine.
Ron, uh, leans over to me and asks me, "Are we gonna get in trouble?"
Said, "What you mean?"
I just lost it.
He charged Ron, and we end up breaking it up.
I just needed confirmation that it was kinda, like, over.
Yeah.
Then the police comes in and trying to grab me to take me to jail.
And I'm still… Again, I'm on survival mode.
I'm like, "Look, I'm not going with you."
"I am getting on this bus and getting on that plane,
and I'm going home." "Reach out to my lawyers."
The NBA and some of its fans achieved a new level of outrageousness last night.
A fight broke out between the Pacer team and the fans in the stands.
…disgraceful brawl at the Pacers-Pistons game in Detroit
may be the ugliest act of pure hooliganism in US sports history.
Everybody talked about it. Every show talked about it. ESPN played it every five minutes.
It wasn't a brawl in Detroit Friday night. It was a full-scale riot
and one of the ugliest incidents of player-fan violence
we've ever seen in this country.
The players, paid gazillions of dollars here,
these are guys who have never had to follow the rules.
They violated the number-one rule for any professional athlete,
and that is no matter what is said, no matter what is thrown at you,
you don't go into the stands.
The narrative had changed.
It was all about us, the players.
Ron, Steve, JO, it's their fault. They were being thugs, acting out of line.
Like, all of a sudden, my character is in question.
It wasn't just the amount of people that were saying it.
It was the stature of the people who were saying it.
And it's tough to argue the certain thug mentality hasn't crept into basketball.
The thug image is there until somebody excises it from the league.
"These are thugs." Literally, that's the word that he used.
Everybody else signing off. "Yeah, it's rap music…"
Well, they're not saying that
when hockey is beating the hell out of each other for decades.
The NBA says it's fighting a bad boy image.
The tattoos, the fights, the drug busts.
Are the media helping the NBA market this as a kind of in-your-face, hip-hop sport?
The hip-hop generation of players seeming to some more estranged from the fans
than the Magics and the Michaels that preceded them.
The dress code was immediate.
It's the old famous saying. "Should have never gave them niggas no money."
There is real resentment against some of today's major players.
Many of the fans consider them to be overpaid,
underperforming, overly coddled, and immature.
Players have not learned how to… how to act, in many cases,
Players have not learned how to… how to act, in many cases, within a civilized, normal society.
Television was putting pressure on our league to say, "Hey, look,
Television was putting pressure on our league to say, "Hey, look, these guys are… are hoodlums, these guys are out of control,
these guys are… are hoodlums, these guys are out of control, these guys are this and that."
The visual of NBA players going into the stands and fighting
goes around the world. You have to stop that immediately.
The NBA has been under heat for a number of years
and clearly has been hurt by this impression a lot of its players give
that they are, uh, gangster wannabes
or, in some few cases, actual felons.
Pressure on the NBA to clean up its ranks,
send a message that these guys are not a bunch of thugs.
It's going to be real interesting to see what the league does.
This is the type of publicity they can't afford.
Don't you think it's important the NBA has to send a message…
-A message will be sent. -…send the strongest…
-…possible message… -…to make sure it doesn't happen again.
Today, I announce the, uh, following suspensions,
uh, resulting from the actions
uh, resulting from the actions at the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons game
on November 19th.
Uh, Indiana's Ron Artest has been suspended for the remainder of the season.
Indiana's Stephen Jackson has been suspended for 30 games.
Indiana's Jermaine O'Neal has been suspended for 25 games.
The NBA has handed out unprecedented punishments
to the players involved in Friday night's basketball game.
John, this may be unprecedented punishment.
The NBA just announcing
that Ron Artest has been suspended for the rest of the season.
David Stern was basically telling everyone, players and fans alike,
"This will not be tolerated. An incident like this will not be tolerated again."
Not one time have I thought that I shouldn't be punished.
But to 25 games? I ain't okay with that, because everything I did,
I had to do in protection.
I wish I could have been interviewed right after,
'cause then people could have been like, "He's right," "He's wrong."
There could have been way more opinions, but the opinion was only on the film
and the suspension, and we had to be quiet.
[O'Neal] I never had a conversation with David Stern about it.
The narrative was based on an edited… conclusion on ESPN.
Not even a fair trial of what it was.
Commissioner Stern has wide power in this situation, you know.
Usually, in light of situations where something like that occurs,
you have a situation where an independent arbitrator comes in
and negotiates between the two sides
to reach a… reach an agreement on some kind of punishment.
But since this was an on-court issue,
the third arbitrator is… There is no third arbitrator.
It is Commissioner David Stern. It comes to his doorstep.
It is Commissioner David Stern. It comes to his doorstep. He's the final word.
-It'll be interesting to see… -Such a deal. I like that deal.
-It'll be interesting to see… -Such a deal. I like that deal. You get to call the shots.
-You get to review the shots. -Exactly.
[reporter] The decision to suspend Artest for the entire season, was that unanimous?
-It was. -[reporter] Why?
It was unanimous.
One-nothing.
[interviewer] It seemed at first, this was a complex situation,
but then it suddenly became very black-and-white.
What do you think changed?
-You know why it changed, right? -[interviewer] Why did it change?
-Do you know why it changed? -[interviewer] No.
-You don't know why? -[interviewer] I don't.
Who got the suspensions?
-[interviewer] Players. -Who took over this process?
-[interviewer] Stern. -There you go.
The NBA is very cognizant of the fact that you don't wanna alienate any fans
because they're the ones that pay your bills.
They want to blame us to save the league. They didn't wanna put it on the fans.
You're sitting, watching people throw darts.
And you can't say nothing.
I think the narrative is slightly different if they see all the footage.
I don't mind taking blame, but I also would like the story out there.
Like, what happened? Go frame by frame.
I'd like to introduce David Gorcyca, the Oakland County prosecutor.
[Gorcyca] The NBA was worried about their perception.
Their image was… was tarnished,
and the severity of the sanctions and suspensions was… was pretty harsh.
I think they wanted me to send a message to these millionaire-type bullies
that, "Hey, you can't be doing that." But my job was to look at the facts
and decide what the appropriate charges are.
Everyone involved in this altercation will be held accountable,
regardless of their status as a player or a fan.
The magnitude of this case was like no other.
It got bothersome from a media perspective.
They're just constantly on me daily.
They wanted to pontificate about what I should or shouldn't do.
It was a lot of work, uh, that went into this.
Gonna be a very long investigation,
probably more complicated than a murder because we have so many witnesses.
There was over a thousand pages of police reports.
Unlike most crimes, we had so much footage from different angles.
The Palace had a VHS tape for each and every camera that was inside the arena
and then all of the cameras that are on the concourse as people were leaving.
We wanted to identify every single person--
player, fan, employee of the Palace. Anybody that did anything wrong.
Eventually, we got to the point
where we isolated images of the people that we were looking for
and we started broadcasting them out.
[newswoman] Breaking developments in the Palace brawl.
Local Four has obtained exclusive video
of the man accused of throwing a chair into the crowd
during Friday night's frantic melee.
The man who threw the chair
and struck the two individuals was a clear-cut case of felonious assault.
When you look at some of the fans, some of them relished it and got into it.
Charlie Haddad and AJ Shackleford,
they came down several rows and walked on the court,
one of them coming on the court
face-to-face with Ron with a clenched fist.
So Ron had every right to defend himself at that point.
[Haddad] It was just crazy. Made it look like it was my fault.
They definitely did a very, very loyal fan wrong.
[Gorcyca] One of the main people we wanted to locate was the guy that threw the cup.
The main focus has to turn to the person who started the riot.
The guy who threw a beer can.
[Gorcyca] The biggest issue was we could not identify the cup thrower.
And I was watching, and I went, "Play that back."
It took me ten, twelve takes of the video to finally put it together.
And it dawned on me where I recognized him from.
He used to date, uh, a neighbor.
So I knew who it was. So I ended up identifying the cup thrower myself.
-[reporter] Can we talk to you? -Can you leave our property, please?
-[reporter] Asking if I can talk to you. -[man] No, man.
[newsman] The suspected cup-throwing fan,
who the prosecution identified as John Green,
tried to chase reporters away
from his suburban Detroit home on Monday with his dog.
I was in my office and our dispatcher called back to me and said,
"I have a guy on the phone saying he's John Green, the guy that threw the cup."
[Green] It was really wrong. Those guys shouldn't come up like that into the stands.
-Especially if you have the wrong guy. -[Martin] Right.
-[Green] That's me. -[Martin] That's you?
[Green] Yup. There, that's me.
-[Martin] Do you still have this jersey? -[Green] I have it.
-[Martin] Do you still have this jersey? -[Green] I have it. -[Martin] Can I see it? -[Green] Why?
-[Martin] Can I see it? -[Green] Why? -[Martin] I gotta verify that-- -[Green] I have it. Am I in trouble?
-[Martin] I gotta verify that-- -[Green] I have it. Am I in trouble?
[Martin] No, no one's charged at this point.
[Green] Before-- Let me call my attorney real quick.
The man who started it all.
Boy, he became public enemy number one.
Now, for the first time, he speaks out.
[Green] It's apparent who threw the cup.
[interviewer] You were wearing… I saw that Ben Wa--
[interviewer] You were wearing… I saw that Ben Wa-- Either that or you have an exact twin who was standing up there.
I've been told that a few times.
[interviewer] Yeah. People have pointed at you as the person who threw that cup.
-[Green] Right. -[interviewer] When somebody says that,
"Were you the guy that threw the cup?" how do you answer that?
[Green] Uh, at this point, you know, I… No hable.
You know, I mean, the video pretty much speaks for itself.
[interviewer] Did you feel bad at all when Ron Artest is flying up there and goes right by you and attacks the guy next to you?
and goes right by you and attacks the guy next to you?
[sighs] I felt relief. No. [laughs] Jeez!
No. [laughs] Jeez!
[interviewer] Do you have any, you know, compassion within yourself
or some pity that he went after that guy, and you were the guy who…
The only thing I regret is not putting my foot out sooner.
-[interviewer] And tripping him over? -Yeah.
I think John Green precipitated this whole melee.
[reporter] It seems that you're holding fans…
You're saying fans are more culpable here than the players. Is that correct?
I would say one fan is more culpable, and that being Mr. Green.
He doesn't throw that cup, Artest doesn't go in the stands,
the players don't go in the stands,
fans don't react to the players in the stands,
and probably the whole melee, uh, dies on the court.
All of 'em, except for, I think, John Green,
it was fines, costs, probation, community service
that ultimately was the sentence of each one of 'em.
John Green was charged with one count of assault and battery
for throwing the beer, as well as another count of assault and battery
for coldcocking Ron Artest.
[O'Neal] It's important for people to understand after the criminal part,
I went through a process to appeal my suspension.
And once it finally got to federal court,
a federal judge, who then saw every camera angle,
said I had the right to do what I did.
I'mma be honest with you. I didn't go up there with no story.
I didn't give a fuck.
I was put in a situation where I either help my brother or not help him.
I was put in a situation where I either help my brother or not help him. I chose to help him.
I apologized for going in the stands. I apologized for embarrassing the league.
That's why I left it. I wasn't going in there kissing no ass.
They didn't decrease mine. They decreased JO's.
And, uh, Ron had his full-year suspension as well.
It was… [sighs] a significant amount of time for what it was.
They were misdemeanor assault and batteries.
Normally, you'd spend less than an hour on that case, start to finish.
What the criminal justice system did to them
paled in comparison to what the NBA did to 'em.
That cup of beer changed everything.
Cost all of us…
a lot of money and time.
You know, it cost a lot of people a lot of things.
[commentator] Reggie Miller with universal respect.
And the way he played this year, there was talk about would he reconsider.
And Reggie's given no indication that this is anything but final.
[crowd chanting] Reggie! Reggie! Reggie! Reggie! Reggie! Reggie! Reggie! Reggie!
[Miller] Once all this happened,
that's when I was like, "It's time for me to hang it up."
[Jackson] If the brawl hadn't happened, we would have been champions. No question.
That's the most fucked-up thing about it.
That's the only thing I regret about the whole situation,
is not being able to do what we said we was gonna do for Reggie.
[Miller] It was bittersweet because so many emotions run through your mind.
It was, like, fast forward 18 years.
That's your last NBA game ever.
[voice breaking] It's special, man. It's pure and special.
It is.
[voice breaking] For 18 years,
I've truly been blessed…
…to be a Pacer and a Hoosier.
Yeah, it's painful. Uh…
For me, it's painful. He did about everything you could do.
I apologize for that, because there's no reason why, uh, Reggie,
because there's no reason why, uh, Reggie, uh, should be sitting home without a ring.
[Artest] The Indiana jersey I had on
was projected on television at my worst moment.
So, wearing it, I wanna hide.
I didn't wanna ever play in an Indiana jersey. Too much pressure.
I asked to be traded, 'cause like I said, I don't confront things head-on.
But I think it'd be best if I move on, and then, you know, they can move on.
You know, everybody can move on with their careers.
[Jackson] That was a slap in my face.
After all we'd been through the last year, now you wanna leave us?
That had a lasting effect with me and Ron.
You gotta be accountable for the people that you pulled in.
And to me, that was the most coward scenario
I've ever fucking seen in my life.
Sometimes you're a coward and you gotta admit it. Boom. Simple.
You know, and, yeah, I didn't… I should've…
What you do in a moment like that is call your teammate,
even if it's really uncomfortable.
So, yeah, I wish that would have happened.
It took a long time to figure out what's wrong.
At 23 years old, if I had more balance, I probably would have been really great.
Ron Artest, by the way, uh…
Ron Artest of the Los Angeles Lakers had some big news today.
Ron actually filed papers to have his name legally changed to Metta World Peace.
-Ridiculous. It reminds me of Prince… -So dumb.
…becoming the Artist Formerly Known as Prince. How long did that symbol last?
After the brawl, I told my therapist, "All I wanna do is have balance."
"That's it. I don't care about nothing else."
I tried not to have that much emotional attachment to the game.
That's Buddhism, right?
You know, and Metta's a Buddhist name.
You wanna keep attaching yourself to as many positive things as possible.
When you look at my career,
not being a good teammate, like, Metta's the opposite.
Be a good friend, be love, and be kindness.
I wanna communicate, I wanna be a better person. You know?
And that's pretty much what Metta means.
I had a real problem with Ron for years,
and it grew a dislike in my system.
I was probably even more angry once he won the championship.
[commentator] Ron Artest has made the most of his second chance.
And he's come all the way from that Palace brawl
to NBA championship with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Ron, you're the only member of this Laker team
to get that first championship. You, my friend, are a champion. How does it feel?
I was supposed to get one with Jermaine and Donnie and Larry
and Jamaal Tinsley and Jeff Foster over there in Indiana,
and I bailed out on them. I feel like a coward.
I don't even like being in their presence. I feel like a coward in their presence,
you know, 'cause I bailed out on them as a teammate.
you know, 'cause I bailed out on them as a teammate. And then I get to get a championship, you know, so…
Let's talk about this game. You looked in the first half…
I'm over the situation. I lost a lot of money. Whatever.
I still feel like Jermaine's being labeled by that.
Jermaine O'Neal. [small laugh]
He was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest players ever. You know?
[Walsh] When I look at Jermaine today,
I think he probably suffered more than all the players.
Because Ronnie Artest ended up with the Lakers and won a championship.
Even Jack, who had played on a championship team, San Antonio.
So Jermaine's career kinda got short-circuited.
The responsibility of carrying that team and being the leader was on him
when all that happened, and it wasn't his fault.
But he got blamed for it.
I've never really tried to use the word "regret,"
but…
it's a part of me
that, uh, has always bothered me.
Sky 4 was over the Palace of Auburn Hills earlier today,
where crews were beginning to demolish the place.
[newswoman] The Palace was home to the Detroit Pistons and saw three NBA championships
before it closed for good after the 2017 season.
[O'Neal] This thing was drawn out for years.
[O'Neal] I didn't wanna talk to anybody. I wanted to move on with my life.
I've never been able to get away from it though.
People thought that ticket guaranteed them to do whatever they wanted to do.
They can act and treat people any way they wanted.
I'm not saying much of it was correct,
but they had a personal investment in-in those ballplayers.
[O'Neal] Pops up every single year.
Kids that wasn't even born asking me about that.
[Smith] Fans have such an emotional investment in it.
There is a darkness there.
[commentator] If you're a professional athlete, you may not go into the stands.
Boy, what a waste of a lot of time and resources
when crimes and murders were taking place.
Nobody cared about who won the criminal cases,
who won the appeal case.
I wasn't able to speak for years.
This is the last fucking time you can ask me about this shit.
I don't wanna talk about that piece of shit motherfucker who threw that beer.
Okay? I don't wanna talk about losing all that money no more.
[commentator] This is a disgrace.
If there's any fault, it's on me. I thought it would work.
I wasn't right.
Some things just never leave.
They never leave.
Malice in the Palace is… is one of those events.
Noah, Lee, Rachel and I decided to take one week and go on a road trip,
just the four of us.
And while I was busy putting off the inevitable decision
between the two colleges where I got accepted…
[Lee] So, what about you?
I-- I got wait-listed.
Both Berkeley and Harvard.
I was fully focused on making sure we all had as much fun as possible.
-[shouts] -[Elle] And that's exactly what we did.
Let me run you through the highlights.
On our way up to Northern California, we camped in the woods. -[Lee] Hey! -[Elle] Went fishing on a lake.
-[Lee] Hey! -[Elle] Went fishing on a lake.
Fed some wildlife, caught some waves at Big Sur.
Watched Noah becoming friends with Rachel.
Watched Lee watch Noah becoming friends with Rachel.
Watched a shooting star with someone special. Oh, my God!
Saw the fish at the aquarium in Monterey.
Saw a sunset with colors I had never seen before.
And got a reminder about rule number 19. [sighs]
Decided to think about it later.
-Drove to San Francisco. -[bell ringing]
Went to Fisherman's Wharf.
-Ate clam chowder out of a bread bowl. -[all chattering]
-[Elle] Watched the sea lions on Pier 39. -[animals bark]
Watched our naughty video from chemistry lab.
[chuckles] Destroyed our naughty video from chemistry lab.
-Rode tandem bikes in Golden Gate Park. -[laughing]
[Elle] Rode a speedboat in the bay.
-Caught a movie. -[laughing]
-Caught a concert. -[cheering]
[Elle] Even caught a baseball in a kayak outside Oracle Park… Whoa, whoa!
-[Lee] It's coming! -I got it! [gasps]
-Whoa. -[Lee] Whoa!
-[stadium fans cheering] -Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
But the absolute best was watching the Bay Lights
with my favorite two guys in the world.
But when you decide to escape reality,
you know that eventually you're gonna have to come back to it.
So, when we got back home,
I got a job so I could make some money for college,
whichever one I wind up going to.
Oh, hey, guys…
But as hard as that was for me to decide,
a few days later, things got even more complicated
when Noah asked a very unexpected question…
Mmm! So, anyway, I was thinking, uh…
when you get off the wait-list for Harvard, maybe you and I
could go off-campus and get an apartment together.
Wait. You mean, like… like, get our own place?
Yeah, look. [clears throat]
I've been online all day. There's some pretty cool places.
What?
-You wanna live with me? -No.
[laughs] Yes, of course I wanna live with you. I wanna do everything with you.
-Really? -Yes, really.
-How long do we have till Lee gets back? -I don't know.
Geronimo!
-No, no, no, no, no, no! [screams] -[Noah] Oh, shit!
-Hey, guys. Look what I got. -Ooh!
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
[Elle] Oh, boy.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, fine.
-Um, in fact… -Hmm.
-Yes, I would like that very much. -Yeah, I thought you might.
-See you. -Where are you two going?
Hmm. Noah wants to read me poetry and tell me all about his feelings.
-Really? Is that what you wanna go with? -[clattering]
-[laughing] -[Lee] Smooth move!
Oh, I wanted to show this to you.
[Rachel] What is it?
I have painstakingly coordinated my Berkeley schedule
with your Rhode Island School of Design schedule.
-[Rachel] Aww. -First up, we've got Labor Day.
I know it's early in the semester, but it's a long weekend,
and I'm pretty damn sure I'm gonna be having my Rachel withdrawals.
That could work.
Of course it'll work. We'll make it work.
[Rachel] Okay.
This place is so nice. Thank you for bringing us here.
Well, we wanted to finally take you somewhere special
to help celebrate your graduation.
So, any big plans for the summer?
Well, actually, now that you mention it,
we were all talking about heading over to the beach house this weekend,
if that's cool.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine. Um, we just have some news for you.
We are planning to sell the beach house.
[all] What?!
It doesn't make sense to hold on to it anymore.
Now that you kids are going off to college.
You know, the upkeep on the place is hardly worth it since we're not even gonna be there.
Truth is the whole area is being redeveloped.
You know what you sound like, Mom? You sound like a realtor.
That's because I am a realtor.
Wait, so where are we gonna watch the fireworks on the Fourth of July?
No, I'm sorry. I'm putting my foot down. You guys are not selling.
I gotta go with Lee on this one.
This house has been in our family for, like, 80 years.
You can't just get rid of it like that.
Is this a vote? Because I vote "no."
I'm sorry, guys.
It's been decided.
I'll be right back.
-Hello? -[exhales]
Miss Evans, this is Don Washington from UC Berkeley's admissions.
I'm following up on your decision regarding Berkeley.
Uh, yes. Hi.
Um, is there any way I could just get another small extension?
I'm very sorry, Miss Evans,
but we need your decision by end of business day tomorrow.
[Elle] I knew that I couldn't hide from it any longer.
Uh, okay. I understand.
-Thank you. -[Don] All right.
[Elle] The next day, I had to pick a school
and make one of my two favorite people very unhappy.
I'ma hit you with a "draw four," "draw two." Uno, Uno out.
-[Mr. Evans] Oh, no! -What? Gosh!
Let's go. [grunts]
-Did he cheat? -[Brad] Unh-unh.
-[laughing] -Aww. I miss this. I feel like I barely see you guys anymore.
Yeah, I know.
-They're keeping you busy at work. -Very busy.
But don't worry, I'm still good to babysit tomorrow.
Do you think you're gonna be working a lot of weekends with this new job?
Uh, yeah, looks that way.
Uh, but I'm not working tomorrow night.
I got a date.
[Elle] A date?
-Really? -Yeah.
Um, how many dates have you been on with this mystery person?
A few. Her name is Linda.
Interesting.
Well, obviously, we,
Brad, are gonna have to give you a curfew, young man.
-Okay. Understood, ma'am. -[both laugh]
[Elle] The next day, we all drove down to the beach house
to do something I never thought I'd have to do.
Help the Flynns get ready to sell it.
I had spent literally every summer of my childhood
hanging out here with Lee and Noah.
And the idea this would be our last summer here together
was just hitting me.
[sighs] I was really gonna miss this old place
in ways I hadn't even realized yet.
-I'm so sorry. -No, no, no, don't worry about it.
It's always been like that.
-Oh. -Oh, man.
This is funny. Elle and I, we used to pretend this was a diamond.
-[laughs] -And we would, like, pretend to steal it.
It was like this big jewel heist.
Look how young we all were.
[Lee] What's weird is it doesn't feel like all that long ago to me.
You should keep that one. Mom would like that.
Maybe I will.
Hey, we were thinking about ordering a pizza.
-Does that sound good? -Yes, absolutely.
In the meantime, could you get started packing up the rumpus room?
-Yes. -Yeah, all right.
[Lee] Come on.
-Whoa! -[toy squeaks]
[sighs] Okey dokey. Here's what we should do.
We need to make one pile for the stuff we wanna keep
and then another pile for things we wanna put in bags and donate.
-[rock music playing] -♪ It's time to work… ♪
[groans] I wanna keep that one. Yep.
Yep.
-Nope. -[Lee] Yep.
-Oh, you cheater! -Oh!
-[Elle] Well, that was productive. -[laughing]
Wait. Oh, my God! I just remembered something.
-Oh, my God. It's still here! -[gasps] Our Mario Kart lunch box!
What?! Oh, my…
No!
Wait. Is that what I think it is?
-It's our beach bucket list! -What?
Oh, my God!
A long time ago,
Lee and I put together a list of all the crazy things we wanted to do together
before going to college.
It was all of our childhood summertime dreams and fantasies
listed out on one very important piece of paper.
-Damn. We put together a solid list. -Yeah, we did.
-We could get arrested for that one. -[laughing]
-Uh, yeah, no, uh, we actually could. -Wow!
So, how long does it usually take to sell a house out here?
Well, we have to put it on the market,
but, you know, maybe two or three months.
That's gonna be a real hassle running out here all the time, though.
What do you mean?
Well, we have to meet with the appraisers,
surveyors, contractors and the people looking to buy the place.
Well, gee, that does sound like a real hassle.
Yeah, especially, you know, with all the road work that's coming up.
I mean that traffic on the freeway, back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.
[Elle] Not to mention all that cleaning.
And constantly driving up to check on the work that's being done.
Okay, what are you kids getting at?
I am so glad that you asked, dear parent of mine.
Since this is our last summer here at the beach house,
and since, like you said, you're gonna need someone here, help coordinating some stuff.
We would be more than happy to stay here for you.
But we would take amazing care of the place.
So, what do you say?
-We'll talk about it. -[gasps] That's a yes! Ha ha ha!
[Elle] Wait. Not so fast, man. Not so fast. Deal isn't closed yet.
Guys.
Come on.
-Okay. -Yes! Yes!
But this place needs to be absolutely spotless.
-I mean it. -Well, yeah, yeah. Of course.
It shall be done. Your wish is our command.
-[Mrs. Flynn] Okay. -[Lee] I love you. -Have I told you told that recently? -I'll be right back.
-Have I told you told that recently? -I'll be right back.
[Lee] Not a worry in the world. We got you, Ma. You're the best. -[beeps] -[exhales]
[man] Admissions. Berkeley.
Hi. Uh, this is Elle Evans. I'm--
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Yeah, I'm just calling to let you know that I've-- I've made a decision.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah. -Okay.
What's going on?
I got off the wait-list.
Harvard.
-What? Ha ha! -Ooh!
Wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop. Put me down. Put me down.
Oh, shit.
Crap.
Hang on.
Lee!
Lee!
Lee, can we please talk?
What's there to talk about? You know, this is just the way things go, right?
No, what-- what do you mean?
It's just the way the world works, you know. Friends leave. They grow apart.
We are-- we're gonna talk every single day, and I will see you on holidays.
No, because I'm gonna-- gonna be with Rachel on holidays.
Okay, yeah, that's-- that's fine.
But like you told her, we're gonna make it work too.
And come on, dude. We just-- we landed a beach house, right?
We can make this summer a blast.
-I promise. -Yeah.
Kind of like you promised about rule number 19?
That is not fair.
I can't just not be upset about this, Elle.
Okay, you're leaving me.
[Elle] I felt horrible about hiding all this from Lee.
But the truth was I was leaving him,
no matter how much I wanted to be at Berkeley with him too.
And it was killing me to see him so upset.
All I wanted to do
was show him how much he meant to me.
Lee,
I don't know what's gonna happen.
But what I do know is that no matter where we are,
you're always gonna be my best friend.
And I just happen to be holding some list
to be holding some list that says we could make this our best summer yet.
So, you're saying…
that we do this whole list this summer.
Our best summer we've ever had.
The best summer ever. Period.
I promise.
I mean, rule number 18.
[sighs] Yeah.
You got into Harvard.
I got into freaking Harvard. [chuckles]
Congratulations.
[Elle] It was our last summer together…
And I was gonna make it count.
The whole summer?
I promise I can still be here whenever you need me to babysit,
so you could hang out with, you know, uh, what's-her-name.
-Linda. -Right. Linda.
But seriously, Dad, I'll take care of everything, okay?
Things will be handled, all right?
Milk will be bought, soccer will be played.
All chores will be done. I swear.
Brad has to be picked up from soccer on Thursdays.
I'm on call every other weekend.
So, is that a yes?
-That is a yes, Ellie-bear. -[shouts]
Yes! Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you.
This is so awesome.
-Got a really good feeling about this. -[Lee shouts]
♪ Some people only talk about it… ♪
[Elle] Move over.
Sorry. Wrong number.
-[honking horn] -Yo, dude! What's up?
-Oh, my! -[Lee] Oh, man!
To the last and best summer at the beach house.
-Yeah! -Cheers.
Oh, I just wanna let you know
I might have invited a few people over tonight, you know, to celebrate.
How few?
Hey, bitches!
Hey, girl!
Come in!
Elle, this place is killer.
We thought you were poor. [laughs]
-Oh, well-- -Is that not crazy?
-That is crazy! -[Gwyneth] Oh, my God!
-Okay, we'll see you later. Bye. -See you, guys.
This is our next door neighbor. Ashton.
-Hi! Welcome. -Hi.
-Are you a Berkeley guy? -Yeah, just finished my first year.
Dude, I start in the fall.
Get out of here, man.
[Lee] Wait. I've got a million questions. Can we chat?
-Absolutely. Fire away, man. -Yes! Sick.
[Elle] Seems like a nice new friend.
[Elle] Actually, it was nice to know that Lee would have a friend when he got to Berkeley.
And I take it you're a Spider-Man fan too.
I don't know. Does driving 600 miles
to find a copy of Amazing Spider-Man #3 make me a fan?
[laughs] That's another thing. Oh, man. This is crazy.
[Elle] But I have to say,
it felt a little weird when I realized that friend wasn't gonna be me.
You know what? I got-- I got an idea.
To the, uh, last summer at the beach house.
[Lee] And the best summer ever! Period!
[Elle] Like I said,
gonna make it count.
Good morning. It is one o'clock in the afternoon, sunshine.
-[groans] -Sports drink and aspirin to your left.
Oh, yes, please.
Well, come on. Aren't you gonna ask me why I woke you up?
-Why the hell did you wake me up? -Oh, my God. I thought you'd never ask.
Well, Lee Flynn,
as promised, our bucket list.
I have carefully planned and very intricately scheduled each item
to make sure we soak in all of its summery goodness.
Here we go.
-[man] One, two, three! -["Good Lovin'" playing]
♪ Good love, good love! ♪
♪ Good love ♪
-[Elle] Go! -[both slurping]
-Oh! -Oh, God!
[Elle] Yeah!
Geronimo!
Oh, my God! Here we go!
-[man over PA] Ready? Go! -[crowd cheering]
-[man] We got a winner! -[cheering]
[Elle] Hey, babe.
No! No!
-This is the best day of my life! -[laughing]
[Noah] I'm literally gonna murder you!
-To making… -[both] Dreams come true!
-[Lee] Oh, my God! -[shouting]
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner.
-Yeah! -[cheering]
-♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah! ♪ -♪ Yeah, yeah… ♪
-This is amazing. -You've done this before.
-I swear to you. I've not. -No.
-Oh, I'm done! -Yes!
-Hey, Noah! What day is it? -Sunday.
-What day? -Sunday!
[both] Oh, okay.
[Elle] We got him!
-This is the first time this has happened. -What?
[both] Hey!
-[growls] -[screaming]
[Elle groans] Bucket list.
[Noah] Yo! You're gonna be late for work.
Lee.
-Hey, May. -You don't work here. Stop sweeping.
-[Lee] But there's sand everywhere. -Oh, sweet boy.
-Hey, Elle. -Yeah.
So I have you working a double today.
And then I put you down for those extra shifts you wanted.
-Extra shifts? -Mm-hmm.
Uh, okay.
Is there a problem?
No, no, it's no problem. Thanks, May.
-Thank you. -Okay.
[Elle] Yeah. No problem at all.
[Elle] Hey, that's my job.
-Dude! [chuckles] -Are you kidding? I just wanna help.
You know, we're not gonna be able to do all of our bucket list items.
[Elle] Bucket list item number 22.
Live together at Berkeley.
[sighs] This one was gonna be tricky.
Hey, um…
I've been thinking. And what if I just went up with you now?
Yeah, we go up to Berkeley. We'll find an apartment, get set up.
It'll be like we're moving in together without the actual, you know, moving in part.
-I accept your offer. -Ooh, yay!
Hi, guys. Sorry about the wait. I--
-Elle? -Oh, my God.
-[chuckles] -Uh, hi.
-[splutters] How are you? -[chuckles]
-Oh, my God. It's so good to see you. -Elle, nice to see you.
-Hey. -Hi.
Um, I haven't seen you since graduation.
W-what are you doing here?
Well, we were hungry.
That makes sense. You are here, and you are hungry.
[chuckles] Um, of course. What can I get you? Do you wanna go first?
I've got some recommendations for you.
-Hey. -Hey.
Sorry for the weirdness earlier.
[chuckles] Oh, gosh. Don't worry about it.
I hope things can be cool for us,
since we'll probably run into each other around here.
Of course it can. Yeah.
Um, are you hanging out at the beach this summer?
Yeah, I just got a job lifeguarding at the water park.
Oh, cool. Wait, wait, wait. Is that the one with the giant go-kart track?
That is the one.
Interesting.
Um, question…
Hey.
Hey, loser. What you up to?
[clicks tongue] Uh, just doing some apartment hunting.
Good. Your last place smelled like weird old cheese. [laughs]
Okay, so listen.
The fam are gonna be in LA earlier than I thought.
Oh, that's great. You should come by our place for a bit.
-Come crash if you want. -Are you sure Elle won't mind?
Maybe you should ask her first.
No, it's okay. We're in a pretty good place right now.
I think it'll be good.
Cool, cool, cool. You think you can pick me up when I get in?
-Yeah, of course. -Perfect. I'll text you the address.
Okay, bye.
That's why it's so funny.
Actually, um, you rushed out of the house so-- so quickly this afternoon.
I didn't-- I didn't get a chance to ask you. I--
I'm sorry. I've had, like, a million things going on.
But, um, ask me what?
Well, Chloe's actually gonna be in town,
and I told her it would maybe be cool if she wanted to stay at our place for a bit.
Is that okay with you?
Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, absolutely.
As far as I'm concerned, that is-- that's ancient history.
And she can come with us to the-- the water park.
What's the water park?
Okay, so, totally random.
I ran into Marco and his family eating at the restaurant,
and he actually has a job at the water park.
So he's gonna help us with this cool bucket list thingy.
Oh, cool. Marco.
Wait, that's--
That's kind of a double standard. I was totally fine with Chloe.
Well, I didn't kiss Chloe.
I didn't mean for that to come out the way that it did. I'm-- I'm really sorry.
It's okay.
Let's just drop it, okay?
Okay, it's dropped. [chuckles]
[Elle] Okay.
-[Noah] I'm bored. -[both laugh]
So you'll-- you'll come to the water park?
-Yeah, yeah, I'll come. -Okay.
And since you're going,
you can help Lee and I with a bucket list item.
Oh, God. What-- what is it?
What is the bucket list item?
-It's amazing. -[chuckles] No.
-I'll let Lee fill you in. -No.
And that's our epic plan for race day.
So, will you help us?
Absolutely not.
-Why the hell not? -Look, Lee, I'm not gonna wear a costume.
I'll go, be there for Elle…
[chuckles] and whatever this, uh, little mission is that you got going, but, uh, that is it.
You know, if you spent less time worrying about your bucket list,
you might be able to get that taillight fixed.
I like it busted! And screw you!
What?
Did you really expect him to do it?
Well, yeah, I thought that, you know, maybe this time he would actually--
-[sighs] No, no, not really. -[chuckles]
Well, hey, anyway,
I just wanna let you know how much fun it is having you here while I'm working.
-But I do have one question. -What's that?
What does a girl gotta do to get water on table 17?
-Chop, chop! -Yes, ma'am. I'm on it.
-[laughing] -Hey, Lee. [Lee] Hey!
-You ready to go? -[Lee] Definitely.
Ready to go where?
I, uh, invited Ashton to go to the, uh, the comic book show.
Cool.
You didn't wanna go to that, did you? I could stay here if you need me to.
No, no. Gosh, no. I-- I gotta--
[chuckles] Gotta work, so…
-I catch you later? -Catch you later!
Was I a total hypocrite or what?
Bye. Have fun.
This was my fault, after all.
I was the one leaving Lee.
But even though I wanted to be with Noah so badly,
I couldn't help wondering if I should've chosen Berkeley
with Lee instead.
-Hey! What are you doing here? -Hey!
Wanted to stop by and say I got everything set up for you at the water park.
-No way! Oh, my God! Thank you so much. -[chuckles]
No worries.
Is Noah helping out too?
[exhales] You know, typical Noah.
We couldn't get him to wear the costume, but he'll be there.
Is he gonna have any problem with me being there?
No, no, no. It'll be totally fine. Don't worry.
Hey! What's up, handsome? Come on.
Are you sure you wanna stay at my place? This is like a really freakin' nice boat.
[laughs] Okay, listen. The problem is my dad actually thinks he can drive it.
-[door slams shut] -[man] I'm tired of being told I'm a liar.
[woman] Oh, my God, Ron! Do you ever listen? That is not what I said.
Oh, yeah, and also, there's that.
Please. You gotta get me the eff out of here, dude. [chuckles]
-Hey, Dad. What's up? -Hey. Hi, honey.
Uh, listen. Brad's sitter just canceled.
I'm really gonna need a hand with him tonight.
Um, okay. Yeah, that's…
I promised Chloe and Noah we can hang out after work,
but I didn't wanna let Dad down either.
So…
-Hey, dude. -Yo.
[Elle] …I knew I'd have to get creative.
I have a question.
What do you think about coming down to the beach house
and spending the night with us?
You can bring Mario Kart. I'll teach you the ramp jump.
-[gasps] I think I'll go get my stuff. -Great!
Awesome. Do you want some nachos before we go?
-[Brad] No, Linda already made me some. -Linda?
-[Linda] So sorry. -That's okay.
[gasps] Here, here. Let me fix that.
-[Elle] No, no, I got it. I got it. -Oh.
-[Elle] Okay. -Okay.
Well, uh, wine disaster aside, I'm really glad to meet you.
[chuckles] -Uh, yeah. You too.
I'm really glad you're here.
Your dad and I were wondering if you could have dinner with us soon.
Um, you know, I would love to,
but the restaurant has me working such crazy hours lately.
Um, I-- I think I'm gonna have to pass on that.
Okay.
Well, your mom was an old friend of mine.
It'd be nice to talk about her with you, but maybe we could do something else.
Yeah, maybe. Um, I-- I--
But I'm-- I'm kind of in a rush, so I gotta get going.
It was nice to meet you.
No, you too.
Uh, Brad, I'll be in the car.
-Bye. -Bye.
-[Chloe] Come on, come on, come on. -[Elle] Chloe!
-Seriously? -I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-This is ridiculous. No, no, no, no! -[laughs] I'm in.
-Aww. No! -I'm sorry.
-Wow! -[both laugh]
-Well, remind me never to play you again. -[laughs] Oh!
Maybe you should have skipped this college thing.
You know, go pro.
Oh, my gosh. I'm not that good, but thank you.
-[Chloe laughs] -[both shout]
Oh, my God. Your brother is adorable.
Yeah, he's pretty cool.
Yeah, just, um, babysitting, 'cause my dad is on a date…
Okay.
…with his new, uh, girlfriend or whatever he's calling her. I don't know.
I just met her. She's kind of annoying.
-No. -Yeah.
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
all my friends hate their dad's girlfriends.
Oh, well, I don't really, like-- I don't really hate her.
Don't worry about it, okay? I promise you, it's pretty standard.
[Lee] Everybody was wishing they were dressed up like us.
What's great was all the looks were out of pure jealousy.
-They wished they looked as cool as us. -Yeah, yeah.
Where have you been?
When was the last time you checked your phone?
Why? Didn't you go to the-- the comic book thingy?
[both chuckle] She called it a thingy.
-I got this. -All right.
So, yeah, we did end up going to the comic book show.
But then after that, we went up to meet with our friend Elle
for bucket list item number 18.
'80s mini-golf night.
Oh, my God! No.
-Yes! And it was spectacular. -Out of this world.
-[Lee] And Ashton got three holes in one. -That's cool.
No. I-- I just…
Anyway, I'm really sorry, Lee.
Are you mad at me?
No, as long as we're still good for tomorrow.
-Yeah, come on. Prepped and ready to go. -Cool. Also, Ashton's gonna come too.
[laughs] Yay! So fun.
-[grunts] -Let's go!
All right, come on, let's go.
-[chattering, laughing continue] -All right. ♪ Hope this feeling lasts forever… ♪
It's time.
[both shout] Yeah!
What exactly are they gonna do?
It's so stupid. I told her I'm not doing it.
[scoffs] You can be so stubborn.
-Yes. -Sometimes you gotta support your lady.
I am. I'm here. I'm supporting her.
That's if she ever shows up.
[gasps] Oh, she showed up.
-She definitely showed up. -[both laugh]
[woman] Oh, my God!
They've been waiting their whole lives for this. [laughs]
Wario!
[woman] Marco!
Oh, my God. It's Marco!
-Wario! -[Elle laughs]
-You are my hero. -[laughing]
Gimme a helmet.
[announcer over PA] Ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines.
You ready, princess?
Affirmative, Plunger-One. We are go for race day.
All right.
Okay, Melvin. You're my eyes in the sky.
[Melvin] I got you, Elle.
-You're going down! -[boy] Yeah!
-[engines revving] -[cheering] [announcer] And they're off!
-[shouts] -I'm pulling up tight, baby. Ha ha ha!
[Elle] All right, you two. It's go time!
-[Lee] Line up. -[Elle] Don't let them through.
[Lee] Don't open up any gaps. Okay? Keep it closed.
[Elle] We got 'em locked in with this trio, baby!
Oh, come on! Cheater!
[Melvin] Good job, Elle. No one's getting through.
-Yahoo! Mario is number one. -I'm coming for you, Evans.
[Elle] Hope you're hungry.
[Vivian] Bloody hell! -Sorry, Viv! -Oh, this is great.
-Sorry, Viv! -Oh, this is great.
Nice lap, Elle.
Watch your back, Chloe!
-Can a lady get through here? -[Elle] You got this, princess.
-[Lee] I'm on it! -[Randy] Out of my way, Chloe!
[Chloe] Oh, here we go!
No! [grunts]
-[laughs] -Gonna have to try harder than that. -[shouts] -[laughing]
-Hey, Melvin. How we looking? -Uh, mostly clear, Elle.
But Noah's trying to get through.
[Elle] Keep in formation, ladies.
-[Lee chuckles] Let him have it. -[Elle] Your turn, Luigi.
-[shouting] -[Elle] Whoa! Good throw, man!
Whoa!
-[Elle] Oh, my God! -[gasping]
-[announcer] Marco's out of the race. -[laughs]
-Whoa! -[cheering]
[announcer] And now he's back!
Go, Marco. Go!
Whoa! [shouting]
-I got you, Evans. -I don't think so.
-[Lee] Oh, my God! -[Ollie grunts]
She slimed me! I can't see! -[shouts] -[crowd gasping]
-Gotcha! -That was amazing!
Oh, Elle!
-Oh, no. -[Rachel laughing]
-[Lee] No! -[Elle shouts] There can only be one!
[laughs] You got me! [Melvin] Okay, guys, coming up on your final lap.
-Hey, pretty boy. What are you doing? -Winning.
-[Lee] You are dead meat. -[shouts]
-[Rachel] Lee! -[Lee] Sorry, Rach.
[announcer] Rachel's out! And now there's an opening.
-Whoa! -[announcer] Marco and Noah are through.
[Elle] Melvin, what's going on?
Marco and Noah are going at it pretty hard.
Uh, Noah.
Noah, can you hear me?
Noah!
-[announcer] Noah is pulling ahead. -[metal scraping]
-Now, it's Marco. They're neck-and-neck. -[shouts]
-Yeah! -[cheering]
[announcer] Marco wins!
[Elle] Oh, boy.
That was incredible.
-[chattering] -What? Oh, it's glorious.
-[Elle whoops] That was insane! -[man] Oh, my God, guys, that was insane!
Hey, can you hold this for a sec?
Yeah.
Close one.
-Is everything okay? -Yeah, everything's okay.
Come on.
-Don't be mad just 'cause you lost. -You know what I keep thinking about?
Why the guy that you kissed in front of the whole world
is wearing the costume that you asked me to wear.
-Noah! You blow things out of proportion. -Why's he wearing it?
It's very clear that he's still after you--
He's not. There's nothing going on between Marco and me.
If you think that he's not still after you, then you're being naive.
It's embarrassing.
It's embarrassing.
God. I'll see you at the house.
Hey, thank you so much again for today. It was amazing.
Of course. Any time.
You're the best.
[Lee] Sounds like Noah was pretty upset.
You know what?
I don't even care. What we just did was legendary.
I don't know. I sort of think he might have a point.
What?
Listen, I just don't think I would be too happy
if Rachel started hanging out with an ex of hers all the time, you know?
Okay. First off, he's not my ex, Lee.
And second, it takes two people to do something.
Which means Noah doesn't trust me.
It's him that I don't trust.
I mean, he clearly still has feelings for her. So…
Look, if you trust her, then you gotta believe what she says and nothing less.
Is everything okay?
Uh, yeah. It's just-- just stuff with my parents.
What's going on?
It's nothing.
My dad just told me that him and my mom are getting a divorce,
and now they won't stop calling to check up on me.
-Oh, I'm sorry. -No, please.
Just don't make a big deal about it, okay?
[sighs] Eight ball, corner pocket.
-Third time's the charm. -Third time.
It's always the third time. What's that about?
What is that?
[Lee] What? Wait a minute.
What?
No way.
I cannot believe they're getting rid of our DDM machine.
Wait. The DDM machine.
What are you doing?
I'm adding a final item to our list.
The last DDM dance on our machine.
July 5th. You'll be there, right?
[Elle] I don't know if it was the fight with Noah
or that everyone seemed to be coming at me at once,
but I was starting to feel overwhelmed.
-What? You don't wanna do it? -Of course I wanna do it.
But we literally have one month left to finish the entire bucket list,
and then we leave for school.
Yeah.
I get it.
You got your hands full. It's okay.
-[Elle] But just like Lee… -[sighs]
Lee, hold on please.
I'll be there.
…I wasn't ready to let go yet either.
Okay. Thanks.
And we're still on for tonight? All right, we put a lot of work in it.
And we're still on for tonight? All right, we put a lot of work in it. -So we can't be late. -Yeah, no, don't worry. I won't be late.
-So we can't be late. -Yeah, no, don't worry. I won't be late.
Noah, you did all of this?
I wanted to make up for yesterday.
This looks amazing.
I thought you could use a night in. You deserve it.
What's wrong?
Well, there's this…
God. I have this thing with Lee, and it's like we've been planning it for weeks--
Please don't tell me it's a bucket list thing.
I'm sorry. I feel horrible.
You're actually gonna go? I mean, I made you dinner.
-I did this for you, and you're leaving? -No, it's not like I wanna go.
Listen, we're gonna be in Boston together all next year.
I just feel like I'm leaving him all alone.
Me asking you to come to Boston
isn't some, like, evil plot to make you leave Lee behind.
No, I-- I'm not-- That's not what I'm saying at all.
Listen, I'm gonna be back in an hour, okay? I swear.
Fine. Do whatever you want.
Noah. I-- [sighs]
Please.
I'm sorry. I…
[Lee] Hey, you okay?
[Elle] Yeah, of course.
-[Rachel] Mm-hmm. -Sure.
♪ I said you're holding back She said shut up and dance with me ♪
-Yeah! -Yeah!
Oh, my God!
-That was crazy, right? -[woman] That was crazy!
[Elle] The truth was, I was doing the bucket list to soften the blow to Lee
so it would be easier to go to Boston with Noah.
But every step closer we got to finishing the list…
Noah?
…made me feel like I was one step further away from him.
You awake?
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?
I'm painting the trim.
Okay, well, you can paint everything else in this house, just not this doorway.
Well, Mom told me to do it, so…
I don't care what Mom said. You're not painting this doorway.
-Stop being a jerk, man. Just move. -I'm not moving!
Fine.
You're gonna have to sleep at some point.
Brad!
Brad!
Brad!
-Brad? -[Brad] Yeah.
Thank God.
Where were you, dude? I couldn't find you anywhere.
I'm right here.
Well, yeah, but I was supposed to come get you.
Hey, Elle. I wasn't expecting you. Can I get you a plate?
What?
No, no, I'm here because I was supposed to get Brad, and I couldn't find him.
Oh, Elle, I'm so sorry.
Your dad told me how busy you were, and I offered to pick up Brad.
Oh, didn't he text you?
No, he didn't. [huffs]
What I would like, though, is for you to contact me directly
if plans change.
I really am sorry.
But with you working and grocery shopping and watching Brad,
I just felt like you might need a hand.
Well, you were wrong.
We've been taking care of ourselves quite fine for a while now.
Milk was bought.
-[groans, gulps] -Are you okay?
[Elle] Just not this week.
-Can I do anything? -Mnh-mnh.
[gulps] Nope. I got it covered.
How much longer on table 25?
[man] Just hold your horses.
-[shoes squeak] -Whoa! [grunts]
-[clattering] -Son of a bitch!
Hey, you are working.
You-- you doing okay?
Not really. [sighs]
I still don't understand why you guys ended up fighting.
I guess once we moved in together, everything kind of fell apart.
Wait. So what, you're just gonna give up?
I'm not giving up.
I'm just tired of fighting.
Well, then do something about it.
Like talk to her or fight for her. Anything. God!
[Elle sobbing] Between my family and the job,
and just trying to make it up to Lee after lying about Berkeley,
[sniffles] I just feel like I'm running around like a crazy person.
As far as living with Noah in Boston goes--
[sighs, chuckles] Oh, gosh. How much time you got?
-As much time as you need. -[chuckles]
You're really sweet.
[Noah] Hey, what's wrong?
Just go away.
No, I'm not going anywhere. What's going on?
[sighs] It's my parents. They just--
They don't even wanna try and patch things up.
They just want out.
You know,
you see all the problems, and you hear all the fights,
but you still think they're gonna find a way to figure it out.
Listen, why don't I come back at the end of your shift?
We can keep talking.
-Really? -Sure. [chuckles]
Okay, yeah. [chuckles]
That'd be kinda nice.
[Chloe] Look at me.
I'm a 23-year-old woman, and I'm crying because Mommy and Daddy are breaking up.
-Stop. -[sighs]
God, I feel so pathetic right now. [sniffles]
You don't have to do that.
Not with me.
[Elle] Oh, gosh. Should probably get back to work. [chuckles]
Thank you.
Come here.
I'll see you later. ♪ I'll not forget ♪
Sorry. We're closed.
Hello?
Hi.
May I have this dance?
Noah Flynn wants to dance?
Yeah, just this one time.
I don't like fighting.
Me either.
But I'll fight for you.
I'll fight for you too.
Hey, dude. Could you, like, not mess up that room? I just cleaned it.
Your mom has buyers coming in, like, 30 minutes.
-What have you been doing all morning? -[explosions]
You're doing it wrong. Here, gimme.
[sighs] I do not understand why you're helping her sell the house.
I'm not. I'm just taking care of it like we promised.
-Boom! There you go. -Whatever.
Traitor.
So what time do you wanna leave for, uh, Berkeley next week?
-Oh. Oh, man. -Elle…
I know. I know. I know. I know, but listen.
Noah and I, like, literally just made up.
And things have been kinda off lately, so… [sighs]
And things have been kinda off lately, so… [sighs] I feel like I should stick around.
Sure.
-It's fine. -Thank you.
That afternoon,
I couldn't stop thinking about what I knew I needed to do.
-Hi. -[Elle] Hey, Marco, um…
I just wanted to call, and-- and, um…
say sorry about last night.
Uh, Noah came by, and we, uh, sorted things out.
Okay.
Uh, that's-- that's great.
Yeah.
But thank you so much for being there for me.
I mean, that really meant a lot.
Yeah, of course.
And if you ever wanna talk or need anything,
you know, just call me.
Okay?
Day or night. I mean it.
Thank you.
Um, I'll let you get back to work.
Uh, take care.
All right, bye.
Hey, Tuppen. What's up, dude?
Great.
So what are you doing for the Fourth of July?
So I was cleaning out our room, and then it just fell out of her bag.
So what did you find?
She had an acceptance letter to Berkeley.
Which means that she was never on the wait-list.
-Wow! -I guess she found out, like, in May.
Well, I guess that that does show how much she wants to be with you in Boston.
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
So, look what I got us.
Oh, my God! Lee, how did you get these? -[Lee exhales] -Wait.
These are for the concert on the 22nd.
We're both in college orientation then.
Yeah, I figure we could skip orientation so that we could spend more time together.
-Oh, hi, Ellen! -Ellen, how are you?
-Happy Fourth of July, Ellen! -[Elle] How are you?
Welcome to the party.
Hey!
Oh, Randy! Okay, bye, Elle.
-[Olivia] I'll see you later. -Bye.
[Gwyneth] Hello, Randy!
-Hey, I hope it's okay I'm here. -Um…
Tuppen was, like, pushing me hard to tag along.
Yeah, yeah, of course. Hi.
-There's, you know, food and drinks… -I can't believe that Marco showed up.
I know.
-So, have fun. -[Marco] Cool.
-Thanks. -[Elle] Yeah.
Whoa! One to one.
[man] Let's go!
All right. Whoo!
MVP, baby!
-[man] Let's go! -[man 2] Match point. All tied up.
-Good game, dude. -Good game.
-That's great. [cackles] -Yeah!
Hey, close one.
Yeah. Nice shot, asshole.
You know, you shouldn't be a sore loser.
And I'd appreciate it if you watched your mouth.
Yeah, I'm just trying to have a good time. You're the one trying to hurt somebody.
Hmm. And what are you trying to do?
Look, this little innocent friend thing you got going on,
nobody's buying it.
-It's very clear what you're here for. -Really? What is that?
You still want Elle.
-You shut up. -Guys, can you please stop this?
You still want Elle, and everybody here knows that.
Yo, I said shut up.
The sooner you get that through your thick skull, the sooner you-- -[crowd gasping] -Noah!
-[crowd gasping] -Noah!
I'm not doing this.
You okay?
[Elle] Noah!
Noah! Noah!
Noah, please… [panting]
Will you please say something?
I asked you not to let him back in our lives.
Wait, Noah!
Noah, wait. [sobs]
Elle! I am so sorry.
-I cannot believe that you just did that. -He-- he was pushing me.
-I didn't know what to do. -I don't care!
You just-- you seriously-- you need to not be here right now.
You just need to go.
Look, Noah was right.
And you know he was.
Look, I know I've messed up a lot,
but it doesn't change how I feel about you.
And I know you're not meant to be with that guy.
-No. -Please just give me a chance and I'll--
Stop it. Stop it! Stop!
[sobs] You need to go. Please.
-Look what I found. [chuckles] -[Brad] Oh, Monopoly!
-[Brad] The game… -[Linda] …is on!
[Mr. Evans] Okay. Brad, you do the honors.
Is that your favorite game, Brad?
-[Brad] It is my favorite. -Oh, wow! Yes!
-[Brad] I'm gonna set up these pieces. -[Linda] This one's for you.
-He's very particular. -[laughing]
Oh, and I call the race car.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Hang on. We have to roll to pick our pieces. -[Mr. Evans] Play by the rules! -[Brad] Okay.
-[Mr. Evans] Play by the rules! -[Brad] Okay. [chuckles] She's serious.
All right, I got this. I got this.
-Yes! -Oh!
I get to choose. Whoo!
And I will choose the doggy.
Oh, no, no, actually-- sorry. I'm-- I'm always the Scottie.
Come on, Elle. I rolled first.
-Come on, Elle. Come on. -I get the doggy. Right is right.
It doesn't matter. [chuckles]
Come on, Elle. Give her the piece.
Sure. I'm just-- yeah. I wasn't-- didn't really wanna play, anyway.
Oh, no, hang on. You have it. I want you to have it. Here.
I don't really care what you want.
-Elle! -What?
Well, I'm sorry, Dad. I'm--
She can't just, like, walk into our lives and be all part of it
like she's just been here the whole time.
Linda, you don't belong here.
No matter how hard you're trying to.
[Mr. Evans] Elle!
What was all that?
I'm sorry, but I cannot stand her.
The way that she's trying to force herself into our lives.
-What are you talking about? -She's not Mom.
She never will be.
And I just think it's selfish of you to even be doing it.
-Selfish? -Yes.
I've spent the last six years of my life
making sure that you and Brad are my only priority.
I put that part of my life on hold.
I even took a job that I hate
to earn more money to help you with school.
You stand there and you call me selfish?
-Dad, I didn't realize-- Dad, I had no-- -No, Elle. No.
Do you really think that you are the only person
who needs love in their life?
You have no idea how disappointed in you I am right now.
[Lee] So…
my mom told me a little secret that I think I'll let you in on.
There's, uh, two things in life that are worth spending a little extra on.
First one is, uh, quality trash bags.
What's the other one?
Bacon. Obviously.
I really messed up yesterday.
Your dad will forgive you.
And Noah will come back.
He always does.
Yeah.
-Thanks for helping me clean up. -Of course.
Rule number three.
[Elle] Rule number three is a good one.
Always help clean up your bestie's messes.
Um, are we still good for the arcade later?
Yeah.
I'm glad you remembered.
Of course. I wouldn't miss it.
Lee was right.
Noah would come back.
But I wondered where he was.
And then it hit me.
Hi.
Hi.
you were right about Marco.
And I'm really sorry. I didn't handle that well at all.
Yeah, I guess maybe we both could've handled it differently.
Yeah.
We've been fighting a lot lately.
I mean, I guess.
But you know, I've-- I've just had so much pressure on me, and…
we really haven't had any alone time together.
[Noah] I think maybe it's more than that.
Elle, you and I have been trying so hard.
I know.
Let's say we keep trying.
But this and then in a year's time, it doesn't work out
and, you know, you've moved across the country. You've given up everything you wanted for me.
[splutters] Yeah, but that's for me to decide.
I-- I think-- I mean, I would think that I would know what's best for me.
No, you do. You-- you do. You definitely know what's best for you, but…
I don't wanna be one of the people who makes you put yourself last.
What does that mean?
Look, Elle, I don't wanna be responsible for a decision you make
that you're gonna regret.
-[scoffs] -Listen, now, you can reapply at Berkeley.
No, you can go to school with Lee like you wanted.
I just don't wanna be the one that kept you from being with him.
-It's my decision to go to Boston! -I can't be respon--
Why do you think you get to decide these things for me?
I'm not trying to decide anything--
Look, I know better than trying to stop you going to Boston.
But if you do decide to go…
…it's not gonna be with me.
So, that's it?
The fact that we love each other means nothing? [sobbing]
I do love you,
but maybe sometimes loving each other just isn't enough.
Are you sure this is what you want?
Yeah.
No, no.
Shit!
Shit.
♪ Fading, fading out… ♪
♪ Don't give up, baby ♪ ♪ Baby, now ♪
Lee…
I'm so sorry.
Somehow I'll make this up to you.
That is what this entire summer was about.
Making it up to me.
Well, forget it.
I don't need it.
Please don't do this.
Elle, I have nothing more to say to you right now.
You know that I wanted to be there.
It's just this-- this thing happened with Noah.
You seriously cannot be this upset. It is just a game, Lee.
Is that really what you think this is about?
The game? What, do you think I'm five?
It's not just about the damn game, Elle.
It's about you fighting for our friendship.
Lee, I know you're upset, but this is--
And I don't matter to you, really.
Not compared to him. I never have!
You know what?
God. It's like you are five.
You have never had to worry about anything.
You've had everything handed to you your whole life.
And now, you accuse me of not caring about you?
You know, everything that I've done this summer, everything,
for you and for everybody, just probably proves that I care too much.
This was supposed to be our best summer ever.
But it was never gonna be
because all of those things that just made our summer so great before, that's gone,
because all of those things that just made our summer so great before, that's gone, and we're never gonna get that back.
But you know what? Maybe that's the point.
Maybe we're not supposed to.
At least those of us who have to grow up at some point.
Oh. Oh, and-- and new rule.
Yeah, all of our rules are done.
♪ If I can make your heart… ♪
[Marco] You can't hold on to someone.
The tighter you hold on, the more they wanna slip away.
I should have taken my own advice.
I'm sorry.
[Elle] At some point in everyone's life,
there will be a moment when you feel
there isn't a single place on earth where you actually belong.
This was that moment for me.
Morning.
Hey.
I'm gonna head out, so I just wanted to say goodbye.
How are you?
-[sighs] I don't know if you heard, but-- -Noah called me.
[sighs] I'm really, really sorry.
Things definitely didn't turn out how I expected.
No, for him either.
But there is one thing I know,
and that is that whether he was ready for this relationship or not,
he really does love you.
Guess loving each other isn't always enough.
Maybe not.
Sometimes the timing just isn't right.
You take care of yourself.
You too.
For whatever it's worth…
I want you to know
that I think you are an absolutely brilliant woman.
Thank you, Chloe.
Lee. Noah.
No, it's just me.
-Oh, hey, uh… -[Mrs. Flynn] Hey.
I didn't know you were coming today. I could've taken care of whatever you needed.
No, no, no, it's fine.
I have to meet with the environmental engineers anyway.
They have to approve any shoreline demolition.
Wait. They're tearing the house down?
Putting in condos. [sighs]
[exhales] This day is just getting worse and worse.
Lee told me everything last night.
[clicks tongue] Yeah.
[sighs] And, um, Noah and I are pretty much done too.
Elle, can I talk to you about something?
Yeah.
Other than Noah,
why did you wanna go to Harvard?
-What do you mean? It's Harvard. -Yeah.
-Why wouldn't I wanna go there? -True.
It's just that the whole time I've heard you talking
about where you were going to go to school,
I never once heard you talk
about what you actually wanted to study once you got there.
Yeah, I mean, like, lots of people figure out what they wanna study
once they start going to a college, though.
I know.
But did you ever stop to think that maybe your choice of school
had more to do with what other people wanted for you
rather than what you wanted for yourself?
Maybe it's time that you think about what it is that you want to do.
Figure out what your dream is, what you're passionate about
and then choose a school based on that.
And not let anyone or anything change that.
Thank you.
Come here.
Now you just have to figure out what you're passionate about.
-Is that all? -[chuckles]
[Rachel] Hey.
Hey, I'm glad you're here.
Uh, what do you think about this idea I'm working on?
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
Hey, Lee, can we talk?
Uh, yeah, what's up?
Elle and Noah broke up.
What?
-You talked to her? -Yeah.
You should really call her.
She doesn't wanna hear from me.
Not after what I said to her.
Well, everything that's happened with Elle and Noah
got me thinking about us.
You know, I've watched them trying
to keep up their long-distance relationship,
and I saw how hard it was.
Rachel.
-If I did something, I swear I can fix it. -Lee, no, no. It's not you.
School is gonna be really tough for both of us.
And I just don't think that we should make it harder
by trying to make a relationship work from so far apart.
So you're breaking up with me?
You mean so much to me,
and I just don't want to see us end up like they did.
And who knows? Maybe-- maybe if we're meant to be together,
we'll find our way back to each other.
[shudders] But I love you.
I love you too. [sobbing]
I don't mean to, but…
…I screw up a lot.
And you've done so much for me.
I would never want you to be unhappy.
And I had no right to stand in the way of you and Linda.
[voice cracks] I don't want you to be disappointed in me.
I'm not disappointed in you, Elle.
We all make mistakes.
It's what you do after that shows who you are.
-Hey. -Hi, Linda.
What are you doing here?
Linda…
…I really just wanted to apologize for my behavior the other night.
The Scottie dog piece,
it means a lot to me because that was the piece that my mom always picked
when we would play Monopoly together.
And it was--
Yeah, I know that sounds stupid. It just-- that's-- No, it doesn't sound stupid at all.
I understand.
Thank you.
Elle…
…I would never dream of trying to replace your mother,
but I did care about her a lot, and I have some stories that I'd love
but I did care about her a lot, and I have some stories that I'd love to share with you if you wanna hear them. [chuckles]
I would love that.
-I'll see you later. -Okay.
Bye.
♪ Something… ♪
[Elle] I wanted to reach out to him, but I couldn't,
because if I did, I knew it would be to say goodbye.
And I wasn't ready to say goodbye.
Not yet.
-Yes! Bam! -Oh-oh! I can do that too.
-[Brad] Wait, no! -[Linda] Okay, again.
[laughing] No! No way… ♪ I live life's adventures… ♪
♪ I have a big dream ♪
[Elle] And just as it is every year,
in the blink of an eye, summer was gone.
And it was time for all of us to start our next adventure.
[sighs] I kept waiting for Noah to appear.
I was filled with an odd mixture of feelings.
Desperately wanting to see him,
but dreading that he might actually be there.
[Marco] Looking for someone?
I have a feeling it's not me.
But like you said…
…I'm not the one.
Well, apparently, neither is Noah. So…
I'm sorry.
But I'm glad we got a chance to say goodbye before I go.
-Finally pick a school? -No.
Gap year. I'm going to New York.
I wanna try to work as a musician there.
Wait, really?
You never told me you wanted to go to New York.
I've always wanted to go.
But besides my family, there was only one thing keeping me in LA, and…
and that's all over now.
Well, good luck. You're gonna kill it.
Thanks.
It's my new moonshot.
Well, goodbye, Elle Evans.
Goodbye, MVP.
People pass through our lives.
Some of them fade into memories,
but a few become part of who you are.
[all] One, two, three. To Ellen!
-It's still Elle, but whatever. -[Gwyneth chuckles]
[Elle] It was hard watching all of them leave.
None of them were perfect, but in their own way…
Hey. [gasps]
…each was a big part of my life.
-Best of luck. -Vivian, get out of here with that.
Come here. I'm really gonna miss you.
And now, looking back…
Yeah, don't forget about me.
Get in here. [sobs]
[Elle] …I'm not ashamed to say I loved every damn one of them.
Yeah, of course.
-Bye. -Bye.
So you got accepted to Berkeley?
Yeah.
Why are you showing me this now?
Because that's what I should have done in the first place.
You were right.
You should've told me.
And you would've been okay with that?
No, probably not.
See? This is what I mean. I--
It took me hurting both of you
to finally realize what the problem was.
I just… I care about you both so much
that I've spent my life,
you know, doing what's best for our relationships,
but I haven't really gotten to spend much time figuring out
what would make me happy.
What are you saying, that I don't care about your happiness?
No, no! It's not-- it's not really about anything that you did.
It's holding something back so that I wouldn't hurt you,
even if it hurt me.
You know?
I just really have to stop doing that.
I, uh, I heard about you and Noah.
Yeah.
So then come to Berkeley with me. It's worth a shot.
This is what I'm talking about, though.
I chose Boston to be with Noah and Berkeley to be with you.
But I gotta figure out who I am.
On my own.
Come here.
I'm really sorry about what I said at the arcade.
I didn't mean it.
Yeah, you did.
That's okay.
A lot of it was true.
Then I am sorry we didn't make this our most memorable summer ever.
I don't know. That may be exactly what we did.
So, um, you know where you wanna go?
I think so.
[woman] Come in.
[Elle] Hi, um…
-I-- -[woman] Miss Evans.
What a surprise.
You remember me?
You won the only dance competition I have ever judged.
-So safe to say, "Yeah, I remember you." -[both laugh]
What can I do for you?
[Lee] Hey.
Mom said you were taking off.
Yeah, that's the plan. [sighs]
You knew she got accepted into Berkeley, didn't you?
What are you talking about?
You ended things with Elle, so that she wouldn't miss the chance
You ended things with Elle, so that she wouldn't miss the chance of going to college with me like we'd always planned.
You know, there were a lot of reasons Elle and I broke up.
I didn't want her to make a decision she was gonna regret.
You know, but just 'cause we're not dating anymore doesn't mean I'm gonna stop protecting her.
So, is she gonna go to Berkeley, or…
No, actually. She, uh, she's applying to USC.
-She wants to do video game design. -[chuckles]
All right.
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Yeah.
Hey.
I'm not sure if it's my place to say this or not,
but that thing you said earlier about always needing to protect Elle.
It's not true.
She's always been able to take care of herself.
The only thing she ever really needed from you was…
was for you to love her.
Anyway…
I'll be seeing you, brother.
[Elle] I knew Noah was leaving the next day.
But sometimes, there are goodbyes so hard to do,
you just wanna skip 'em.
And the way that I felt about saying goodbye to Noah
was actually the same way I felt about saying goodbye to the beach house.
-Happy birthday! -[cheering]
[Elle] I couldn't bring myself to take it.
It seemed like if I left the photo,
it would always be hanging there in the same place forever.

but it's how I feel about you.
Your warmth, guidance and kindness
have been some of the best parts of my life.
And I can't begin to say how thankful I am for it.
Instead, I'm enclosing a small gift
and sending it with all my love.
Elle.
-[thuds] -Hey.
You didn't think I'd let you get away without saying goodbye, did you?
I was gonna stop by your place on the way out.
-Hey, you fixed your taillight. -No, I didn't.
-Noah. -Yeah. [chuckles]
-[sighs] Um… -I guess this is it.
It feels so weird to be leaving without you.
I added a new one.
"Rule number 35."
"Always call your bestie every time you miss them."
I love it. Thank you.
So, Mrs. Flynn, I believe you'll find the paperwork
for the sale of the properties in order.
We only need this last signature to finalize the deal.
[Elle] And I can't begin to say how thankful I am for it.
Instead, I'm enclosing a small gift
and sending it with all my love.
Elle.
[man] Is there a problem?
Mrs. Flynn?
No.
No problem at all.
[sighs] I'm just not selling this house.
You'd be walking away from millions.
All of these old homes are being taken down.
Just not this one.
Good day, gentlemen.
[Elle] Oh, that's a great one.
-That one's so-- the light is perfect. -You think? I mean, I don't know.
-I'll see you later, okay? -Yeah, cool.
Do you think that maybe I should…
So you're going to USC?
Yeah, I have an interview for their spring term next week.
It's a really competitive program, so I probably won't even get in. Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?
You put your mind to something, you do it.
I don't know. We'll see. [sighs]
Hey, I'm sorry that things didn't work out between us.
[sighs] It is what it is, Noah.
Me too.
[Noah] Don't forget me, okay?
Goodbye, Noah.
[Lee] Elle, take care of our game while I'm away.
Until our next dance.
Your best friend, Lee.
[Elle] Yeah. Classic Lee.
One of the things that we do here, at the video games department
is we pitch and develop our own ideas into finished products.
We were hoping that you might pitch any ideas you have
for possible games or gaming products.
Yeah, of course, totally, definitely.
Oh, you mean, like, right now?
I'm so sorry. I didn't know that I was supposed to prepare that for today.
It doesn't have to be anything formal. Just a sharing of concepts.
Right, of course. Um…
I--
Oh, my God. Um, I'm so sorry. There's--
Nothing's coming to my mind. I just-- I don't know what to say.
Look, it's not a problem, Elle.
Uh, actually, I-- I think we have everything we need.
-Thank you. -[man 2] Thank you.
Yeah, thank you.
I-- I did have one idea.
But it's-- I mean, it's really just more of a basic concept.
Go ahead, Elle.
You know how in fantasy sports, people draft real-world sports athletes,
and the players' performances are used to determine the success of--
I think we're all aware of how fantasy football works, Miss Evans.
[chuckles] Cool, yeah, sorry. Um, of course. [clears throat]
What if we were to apply that to a large e-sports platform?
Players could get together at the beginning of the season
and take turns drafting their favorite pro players.
And you could even call it "Fantas-E Sports."
And fantasy football's, like, a multimillion-dollar industry, right?
It's $7 billion actually.
See? There you go.
And how much is the e-sports industry raking in?
Uh, two billion.
So, I mean, it kind of seems like that might be worth something.
Oh, and I also have this other idea…
[whispers] Hey, what's up?
I think I got in!
[shouts] Yes!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Okay, you have to tell me. What happened?
Okay, so I got in there, and I was so nervous…
♪ I feel so peculiar I don't know what to say… ♪
[Elle] So Lee and Rachel did end up getting back together again.
It turns out that sometimes
people do find their way back to each other.
Lee and I stayed connected all through college.
And after graduation, Lee moved back to Los Angeles.
And for us, it was like no time had passed at all.
We had both changed a lot, but our friendship hadn't.
And in the fall of that year,
we all found our way back to a very familiar place.
Oh, my God!
No way!
[Elle] And suddenly, there it was.
Lee!
-They're still doing this? -They're still doing this.
-Oh, my God! -[laughing]
The kids at school were still using the Kissing Booth.
And for just a second,
I felt the same thrill and rush
that I felt the night I had my first kiss.
And then I saw him.
Again.
Hey, Shelly.
Hi, Noah.
-[Lee] Noah! -[Rachel laughs]
-Hey! -Hey! Fancy seeing you here.
-It's good to see you, brother. -Ah, it's good to see you, bro.
-Aww! Good to see you, guys. -[Rachel] You too.
-Congratulations again. -[Rachel and Lee] Thank you.
-[Noah] When's the wedding? Have a date? -Yeah, we're thinking, like, late May.
-Okay, late May. Can't wait. -[chuckling]
Well, we were talking about maybe going and getting some churros.
-[Noah] Okay, churros. -Were you now?
-[laughs] -So we'll catch up with you guys later?
Yeah, it's good to see you, bro.
-[Lee] You too. -[Noah] Bye.
-Wow. -Can you believe this?
-No, I don't wanna look at it. -[both laugh]
It's been a long time.
Yeah.
You look so business-y.
Uh, I mean, don't let the suit fool you. You know, I'm still a rebel.
-Oh! -Last Friday, left work 20 minutes early.
Whoa!
-I know. I don't like to talk about it. -Okay.
-Your secret's safe with me. -Don't tell anyone.
-Oh, okay. -[laughs]
Uh, so Lee told me about your job offers.
There's a law firm in New York and one in LA.
I don't know which one I'm gonna choose right now.
Congratulations. That's amazing.
And Lee told me that you're developing video games now.
-Your own game? -Yeah, yeah.
I'm designing games. It's great.
I work at a really small company.
-But there's great opportunity. -Okay.
And I have a lot of creative freedom, so I really love it.
Well, I'm glad.
-What? -I don't know, you just--
You seem so grown up.
I was gonna say the same thing about you.
You know, it feels like yesterday
you were just crashing your scooter down the driveway.
-Well, I'm a much better driver now. -Oh.
I even have my own motorcycle.
Really?
Okay, well, um, I mean, when I'm in town again,
we should go for a ride together.
I mean, if you'd like that.
I would like that. That sounds fun.
Great.
Well, I've gotta-- I gotta go see some friends, and then I've got an early flight, so…
-No, of course. No worries. -But, no, I'll call you, okay?
Sure. Yeah, if you've got time.
I've got time.
-I'm gonna go. Okay. -Okay, all right. [chuckles]
I'll see-- [chuckles]
-I'll see you later. -Okay.
-See you. Okay, bye. -Bye.
[chuckles] Bye.
Standing there at the carnival
and seeing Noah again after all that time,
I couldn't help but think of one thing.
That all of this happened just because of--
well, you know.
-Hey! [laughs] -Hey!
-Yeah, let's do it. -Welcome to The Kissing Booth.
[laughing] Whoa! Holy shit!
[straining] Oh, yeah.
Nice and heavy.
-[laughing] -[man] Smooth move, bro!
Smooth move!
-Actually in the movie, I'm dying. -You should've kept it!
I've gotta burp.
[strains] No, it's not coming. I'll just do it after the take.
What? Lee! Oh, my God!
What in the-- what was he thinking?
Take the apron off, Lee, and go home.
Uh, yeah. Sorry about that, May. Good talk. [laughs]
-Brad is-- [speaks gibberish] -[laughs]
Oh, my heart is beating so fast. [chuckles]
[inhales] It's okay. That's normal.
That is just fine.
[both] That is just fine.
Best line of the movie.
-[Noah] I'm gonna fall! -I'm gonna-- [bleeps]
[Noah] Just stop this thing!
-Whoa! Shit. My bad. -Shouldn't have said "shit."
Ooh! That was weak, mate.
That was so weak. Come on, give it to me.
-Holy shit! -[man laughs]
-This is [bleeps] nuts! -[laughing]
You told me to walk away, right?
We've been dancing on this machine since we could walk.
What do you want me to do?
I want that [bleeps] machine to stop making noise.
I think my feet still smell from yesterday.
Very nice.
-[man] Hey, Vince. -[man 2] Oh, good job, man. Thank you.
Well, that's his. You shouldn't be keeping track of that. [laughs]
Taylor!
-Let me just go get us another snack. -Oh, okay. Is Marco here?
-Hey! Come on, come on, come on! -Really, man?
-What are you doing here? -I just wanna say--
-That guy is reckless. -[laughing]
-Eight ball. -Nope. Nope.
-[chuckles] -[Noah chuckles] Come on.
[Elle] Hold-- hold on.
-What is happening? -I had a script sitting right here.
-[both speaking gibberish] -[Lee] Yeah, yeah, okay.
Wanna play some hoop ball?
Oh, my… [chuckles]
-Like a boss! -[laughs]
Get in there! [grunts]
-Hi. -Hey.
This looks amazing. Thank you.
[belches, laughs] Holy shit!
That's gross. [chuckles]
[Lee] And Harvard tour this weekend!
-Really, Harvard? -Yes.
-Harvard. Shit. -[laughing]
[Lee] It has all been taken care of--
-[both laughing] -I'm sorry.
That is perfect!
-I love you, Marco! Whoo-hoo-hoo! -Absolutely no order!
[man] All aboard!
[Lee] You are buying me a new apple. I swear.
I can't even handle you as a friend anymore. -[continues laughing] -We're over. We're done. We're through.

Kathy, the coin!
-Quick, Tim. Catch it! -[Tim] No.
I-I can't see it.
[gasps] Oi, ratbag!
Why don't you watch where you're walking, you great clumsy lump!
Sorry, Mr. Scrooge, sir. Didn't realize it was you.
Good dog.
Prudence, stop licking that poor boy.
You've no idea where he's been. [laughs]
[ghostly whisper] Scrooge.
[Scrooge whistles] Come now, Prudence.
Bye.
Uncle?
Uncle Ebenezer, is that you?
[sighs] That was close.
Uncle, it is you! I knew it.
Merry Christmas.
[sighs] And where is she?
Where's the finest lady in all of London?
Prudence, girl.
You grow more beautiful with every passing year.
Is Uncle Scrooge taking good care of you, is he?
You don't miss that rotten old Jacob Marley too much?
Why, I was just on my way to your office, Uncle.
What luck to run into you.
Well, Harry, they say a man makes his own luck.
So I suppose I only have myself to blame for this encounter.
Out of time, Jenkins.
Good girl. Oh, yes.
There it is.
Yeah, there's a good girl. Yes.
-Care to make a donation? -To the festive fund for the poor?
-Just enough to make Christmas merry. -Or perhaps a little bit more?
Do you have a permit to perform here?
We didn't know we needed one. Did you know we needed one?
I didn't know we needed one. We didn't know we needed one.
Well, now you know you need one.
So pack up your trumpets, before I call the police…
…to throw you all in prison, leaving me in peace.
Good day, ladies. [laughs]
[ghostly whisper] Scrooge…
[both] How rude!
Uncle! Uncle!
Oh, splendid.
-Uh, here you go. -Oh!
Thank you very much, sir. Such generosity.
Such generosity. Thank you very much, sir.
Think nothing of it.
Why, who would be uncharitable at Christmas?
[both scoff] Who indeed.
Uncle. Wait for us!
I swear I had your money in hand yesterday, Mr. Scrooge.
It's just that my mother, she got sick, you see, and I had to pay for a doctor.
Another fascinating story, Jenkins. But here's a better one.
Once upon a time,
Tom Jenkins, that's you,
owed me, Ebenezer Scrooge, 25 pounds.
Jenkins paid the money in full, and Scrooge lived happily ever after.
The end.
Oh, come on now, Mr. Scrooge, sir. I don't have it right now,
but I'm sure I can scrape it together in another three, four days.
Five. A week.
-Come on, it is Christmas after all. -[toy trumpet plays]
Louder.
Faster!
-He's rubbish. -[laughter]
Christmas? Really? If only I'd known. This changes everything.
Very well, in the spirit of the season,
Mr. Tom Jenkins, you now have until the end of Boxing Day to pay me.
Two extra days. How does that sound?
Two days is better than nothing, I suppose.
Thank you very much, Mr. Scrooge. Most charitable indeed.
Father Christmas has nothing on you.
Ho ho ho, yes, quite.
Now, let's see.
For the inconvenience you have caused me and the extra two days,
shall we say another 25 pounds?
-That would mean I owe-- -Fifty pounds.
It's a good, round number, wouldn't you agree?
Well, 30 is a round number too, Mr. Scrooge.
You're right. But so is 60.
When you put it that way, 50 does have a better ring to it.
♪ Two days, Jenkins, then I'll be back ♪
♪ To take my 50 pounds ♪
Do give my best to Mother Jenkins.
Oh, and Tom,
merry Christmas.
Fifty pounds. Two days.
Look out. [groans]
[both] Merry Christmas.
-[ghostly whisper] Scrooge. -[Scrooge] Hmm?
[Harry] I say, Mr. Jenkins. Do you deliver?
-[toy squeaks] -Mr. Jenkins?
Bah, humbug.
Left a bit. Right a bit. Left a bit again.
Up. No, up.
Left.
Your other left.
There, perfect. You're an artist, Mickey.
An artist would get paid more than a penny
for every thousand posters he sticks up, Beryl.
You there. Yes, you. Who are you? What do you think you're doing?
Who, us?
Sir, we is nothing but a bunch of poor, homeless urchins
trying to make our way in the world.
Quick. Leg it!
Merry Christmas! [laughs]
Blooming children.
-[door slams] -[yelps] Mr. Scrooge. Oh dear.
Welcome back, sir. There's something I should tell you.
The cost of that ink will be deducted from your pay.
What? The ink? Oh. Oh, the ink. Of course, sir, yes.
Get on with your work, Cratchit.
-If it's not too much of an inconvenience. -But, sir--
-I do not wish to be disturbed. -[Bob] Yes.
I've had more than my fill of people for one…
-[toy trumpet plays] -…day.
-We win! -How in the world did you…?
-Prudence knows a shortcut, don't you? -[barks]
Very well, let's get this over with then, shall we?
How does it go again? Oh, yes, yes, the question.
"Uncle, won't you join me for Christmas dinner tomorrow?"
The answer,
"No, Harry, I will not."
"Christmas is a humbug. I despise it and all it stands for."
The same answer to the same question you ask me every year.
I have no time to be merry.
Just because my partner is dead doesn't mean I have no business to attend to.
Quite the opposite. Jacob Marley died seven years ago this very night,
leaving me nothing but business.
Oh, yes, and you.
Oh, come now, Uncle. Hela and I would just love to have you.
Hela? Who's Hela?
You know, Hela, my wife.
She was disappointed you couldn't attend the wedding,
and simply can't wait to meet you.
So at least visit us this evening.
Some friends and I are gathering to toast the season.
Good day, Harry.
Uncle, I'm all the family you have. Why does it have to be this way?
I think Mother would have been so disappointed
that you and I spend every Christmas apart.
Harry, life is full of disappointments.
One such disappointment came on the glorious Christmas Day
that you stumbled into this world.
The very same Christmas Day your mother,
my beloved sister, left it.
I will not be joining you for Christmas dinner,
nor any other celebration of this wretched season.
Now, please leave before I say something you will regret.
[ghostly whisper] Scrooge.
My offer still stands. You are always welcome, Uncle.
-Goodbye! -Merry Christmas, Prudence.
-Bob. -Merry Christmas, sir.
[clears throat] Excuse me, sir, but it's almost 6:00. Six o'clock.
Could I trouble you for my wages, please?
Cratchit, Cratchit, Cratchit…
you do nothing but trouble me.
-[chuckles] Yeah. -[Prudence whimpers]
Five, 10, 15 shillings.
-[Bob] Thank you, sir. -Take away five.
But I'm owed 15.
Consider the other five your payment to me.
-For what, sir? -The ink, of course.
And the day off you insist on taking tomorrow.
Well, sir, it is Christmas.
Yes, as everyone is so fond of telling me.
Sir, this isn't enough. My family, you see, my children… My… My boy needs medicine.
You have children?
Of course you do.
Cratchit, times are hard. And my financial burdens are considerable.
Now should I add to them by paying for the upkeep of your entire family?
-[ghostly whisper] Scrooge… -[Scrooge] Does that sound fair to you?
-[ghostly whisper] Scrooge… -[Scrooge] Does that sound fair to you? No, sir.
No, sir, indeed. Now, let's get you on your way, shall we?
-Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge. -Yes, yes. Ding-dong, merrily.
I expect you at half past seven on Boxing Day.
What? What have I done now?
Why, if it isn't the amazing and wonderful Cratchit children!
[both] Father!
-[gasps] Tim! -Father, help!
It's all right, my little man. Just breathe, slowly.
He's getting worse.
That's it. There you go.
Right, you two. That's it, no more busking tonight.
It's freezing out here, and you need your rest, young man. Aw.
-But we've only made ten pence ha'penny. -Ten pence ha'penny? A bumper windfall!
If we add that to the ten shillings I happen to have in my pocket
and throw in a bit of Cratchit magic,
I reckon we can have as fine a Christmas as the Lord Mayor himself.
-[both] Yay! -[Bob] Just wait and see.
Oh, don't be so dramatic.
I'll pick up a juicy bone for you on the way home. How does that sound?
-The butcher owes me seven pounds six… -[Prudence scoffs]
…so I'm sure he'll be happy to oblige.
[ghostly whisper] Scrooge…
No?
No pleasing some people.
You there. What do you think you're doing? [laughs]
Oh, bravo!
There you go.
Merry Christmas.
You two!
Clear off!
Disgusting.

Impossible. You're dead.
Dead?
Dead tired! [laughs]
Oh, yeah. How embarrassing.
-[Prudence growls] -Prudence. Oh, how well you look. [laughs]
I knew leaving you in the care of Uncle Scrooge
was the right thing to do, hmm? Didn't I?
Hmm? Yes, I did. I did. [chuckles]
I do apologize for the dramatic entrance, old boy.
Those in charge insist on a touch of pageantry.
Goes with the territory, you see.
But I'm sure you and I can discuss the rest like reasonable men.
Ah, I must have drifted off by the fire.
I'm dreaming.
[laughs] Serves me right for eating cheese so close to bedtime.
Well,
very well.
[Scrooge] Ye gods!
[Jacob] Listen well, Scrooge.
This is no dream.
Look upon the chain that binds me.
In life, I forged it, link by link, yard by yard.
It grew to match my greed.
In death, I will never be rid of it.
Nor will you yours.
[gasps] Mine? Yes, yours.
[Jacob] We were all like you.
Trapped in our own selfish worlds.
We never reached out to our fellow men in life,
so are condemned to do so in death.
We have watched you many a day, Scrooge.
Watched your chain grow, link by link, yard by yard.
But you may yet escape our fate.
I have pulled a few chains
and arranged for three visitors to call on you before morning.
The first, when the bell tolls 1:00.
The second, at 2:00.
And the third, at…
Well, 3:00.
Listen to these visitors. Learn from them.
And heed my warning
before it's too late.
Jacob Marley
concerned for someone else's well-being?
Well, it must have been a dream.
Huh?
Humbug.
It's that nephew of mine. Interfering. Bringing my blood to the boil.
Has me jumping at shadows. Seeing things. Yes.
That's it. Yes.
[Jacob] The first, at 1:00.
-Hello? -[ghost yelps]
Oh, hello.
It's Scrooge, isn't it?
Yes, that's the one, Scrooge. [chuckles] What a funny name.
Are you comfortable down there, Scrooge?
Uh, well… Never mind that.
Who, or what, are you?
And it's "Mr. Scrooge," if you please.
Well, Mr. Scrooge-if-you-please, who am I?
I can be anyone you have ever known. I can even be you.
Bah, humbugs.
Christmas is an outrage.
Grr, give me your money. -Interest rates, and so on. -Hmm.
You were not told of my coming? No? No matter.
You have nothing to fear from me. After all, your welfare is my business.
Miss, to be disturbed at this hour is hardly conducive to my welfare.
Your redemption, then.
You see, an old friend of yours
asked me to illuminate a thing or two for you. I--
Illuminate what, exactly?
I was getting to that. You are an impatient one. [clears throat]
I will show you the past.
Christmas past.
Specifically, your Christmas past. Ahh!
There. Much better.
I've gone mad.
Mad, you say?
Jacob Marley floating in my sitting room. Faces etched in frost. Whispers in the wind.
Faces etched in frost. Whispers in the wind. A blizzard indoors.
Now you, a talking waxwork with a wick for brains.
My dreams are never this… exciting.
And none of this can be real. So, yes, I must be awake,
but quite insane.
Well, I may have wick for brains, but I do think I'm real.
Here.
-[growls] -[Past] Oh, hush now.
There, did that feel real?
I-I suppose it did.
It hurt too.
[chuckles] Yes, the past can hurt. Especially yours.
But it can also heal, if you learn from it.
-Now, come with me. -Absolutely not.
I refuse to go anywhere…
Yeah!
[Scrooge] No, no!
Oh, baby Scrooge!
Where? W-What? Who?
Get off!
Sorry, it does take its toll going this far back.
-Did I not warn you? -No, you certainly--
Wait, what do you mean by "back"?
Huh?
-What…? -We're not quite there yet.
Almost.
Here we are.
The past. [chuckles]
Spooky! [chuckles]
I know this place.
It was demolished years ago. I saw to that.
♪ …looked out on the Feast of Stephen ♪
You there. What day is it?
I say-- [groans]
[chuckles] I wouldn't do that. You can't interfere with anything here.
And nobody can hear you. Or see you, for that matter.
-[man] Don't fill it right to the top. -Look!
Young Ebenezer Scrooge, hard at work on Christmas Eve.
Not very festive, is it?
I…
I-I had no choice.
You see, without the modest income I provided, my mother and sister,
th-they would have starved.
-Did your father not have any money? -My father?
He was not a poor man,
but the fool spent his way into debtors' prison.
Oh, I see.
Debtors' prison. Terrible, terrible thing, a debtors' prison.
-What is a debtors' prison again? -A debtors' prison is, uh…
None of your business.

I made it all by myself.
-Merry Christmas, Ebenezer. -Oh, Jen. It's Father Christmas.
-He's really magnificent. -[Jen chuckles]
Maybe you could help me make one for you in return.
Yes, please! [Jen laughs]
Shall we sing that pretty song of yours as we walk?
[both] ♪ The wish that you wish On Christmas Day ♪
♪ Is pretty well sure to come true They say ♪
Oh, such a sweet child. Will she be all right?
She will be. For a while, at least, the sickness will not take her.
My father paid his debts, eventually.
We found the right doctor and she was saved. But…
[Past] But?
She remained a delicate soul, whom a breath might have withered.
Jen died in childbirth. My idiot nephew in exchange for my sister.
A sorry transaction in any currency. And all on Christmas Day.
Christmas.
Oof. Humbug.
Oh, come now.
Is there not one Christmas you remember fondly?
One buried, perhaps, in a hole as deep as old Marley's grave?
-Merry Christmas, sir. -[Scrooge groans]
Hello, Uncle.
I do believe I've found one.
Mr. Fezziwig.
"Fizzywig?" Why, that's almost as silly as "Scrooge."
Off we go.
-A little jump forward this time. -Wait--
[sighs] I'm home then. And not before time.
Very well. You have a week and no more. Or we shall both have to find new employment.
-Good day. -Thank you very much, Mr. Scrooge.
God bless ya. And a merry Christmas when it comes.
[grumbles] It's still the past.
It is.
My word, you were a handsome chap, Scrooge.
What went wrong?
[Fezziwig] Ebenezer?
Is that you, lad?
-Mr. Fezziwig? -[Fezziwig] It is you!
Wonderful to see you, my boy.
[Past] So that's Mr. Wizzyfig.
Fezziwig. Yes, I used to work in his warehouse before Marley took me on.
Why didn't you keep working for him?
Marley offered a position with more security.
People will always need money.
If I'd stayed, I would only have been Fezziwig's lowly apprentice.
I had to better myself before even thinking of proposing to her.
Proposing?
Oh, I do like a wedding. Who's her? Where's her?
[Fezziwig] Flora!
Isabel.
Yes, Father?
-Isabel. -Isabel.
[Fezziwig] Look who I found!
Ebenezer! How lovely to see you.
My, you look splendid in your suit.
-Although, do you mind? -I… I…
-That is… -There.
-That is… -There. -You see… -Perfect.
-You see… -Perfect.
Thank you.
Oh, Isabel, how I love thee.
With thy big slobbery face and stinking dog breath.
Uh, Ebenezer, do you have any plans for tomorrow?
-Tomorrow, sir? -You know, Christmas Day, my boy!
No, sir. My sister is with her husband in Kent.
They're expecting a child any day now.
She invited me to visit, but I had to decline.
[laughs] Then it's decided!
You'll join us for Christmas lunch tomorrow.
I'm not sure I can.
Too much still to be done, and Mr. Marley doesn't even take the day himself.
Say you'll come, Ebenezer. It'll be such fun.
[Past] Oh, look away.
I, uh…
I'll talk to Mr. Marley.
-Did you go? -Well, it would have been rude not to.
I felt obliged.
I see.
See you there.
But you didn't enjoy it?
No. Not one bit.
-[laughs] Oh my goodness. -[Scrooge laughs]
You look like you're having an awful time.
Uh, yes.

[Past] A delightful woman.
Without her,
Jen's death would have taken an even greater toll on me.
You married her, yes?
[Scrooge] No. Not quite. I--
No?
-I would very much like to see why not. -No!
I…
I do wish you would stop doing that.
Home. Finally.
Well, goodbye, whatever you are.
I would say it's been a pleasure, but it hasn't.
Where's my name?
This is before Marley made me a partner.
Ebenezer? Hello?
-I'm still in the past. -[Isabel] Hello?
Oh, you do catch on quickly, don't you?
Ebenezer? Are you there? I brought some lunch.
I see so little of you these days, so I thought…
[sighs] I'm not sure what I thought.
Ah, lovely Isabel.
-But you said you didn't marry her? -We are…
Were merely engaged. For quite some time.
I see. I thought you would have gone back to work for Wiggyfiz?
Of course not!
His charity would have led to the same ruination that befell my family.
"His charity would have led to the same ruination
that befell my blah, blah, blah."
I needed more security than he could offer. We needed it.
I saw them by the baker's only a few minutes ago. Good day.
[grumbles] Lead on, Scrooge. Lead on. Allons-y.
Please, Mr. Marley, sir. This is my livelihood. My home.
My family will starve. Just one more week.
One more day, and I'll have your money, I swear.
You've had three weeks already. I am sorry.
No. No apologies, Ebenezer.
Times are hard, and my financial burdens are considerable.
Should I add to them by paying for the upkeep of your entire family?
Does that sound fair to you?
-Sir, it's Christmas Eve. -Come on.
Please, show some mercy.
-[woman] Where are you taking him? -[man] Clear off. Go on. On your way!
[Scrooge] …and my financial burdens are considerable.
Now should I add to them by paying for the upkeep of your entire family?
Does that sound fair to you, Cratchit?
I… I don't recall this at all.
I'm not surprised. As horrible as this situation is,
I'm sure it was of great financial benefit to you and Marley.
Apart from the delightful Miss Fizzlejig,
you only seem to remember encounters where you lose money.
You dwell on the bad things in life, and then learn nothing from them.
Does Cratchit know?
Why would he choose to work for me? After what I…
If his father had only paid his debts…
It's not my fault.
[gasps] Isabel.
She saw all of this.
[Isabel] Ebenezer.
Can I talk to you?
Alone.
[sighs] Not now, Isabel.
I have far too much work. Later, later.
I'll, uh, leave you two lovebirds to it.
-[growls] -[Jacob] Come, Boris.

Goodbye, Ebenezer.
[Past] Oh, look. A wee glimpse into Isabel's future.
Oh, she looks so happy.
And her husband's gorgeous.
That… That could have been you, I suppose. Oh, too bad, Scrooge. Too bad.
Why show me all of this now? What's done is done. I can't go back.
When we were financially secure, I would have married her…
eventually.
Wouldn't I?
I don't know.
-[Scrooge yells] -Bye!
Take me back.
Take me back!
I'm afraid I can't.
There is no going back, nor changing what has been.
You said so yourself.
You can't change the past, but you can learn from it.
For your own sake, I hope you do, Scrooge.
-Ooh. -[Scrooge] No, no, no, no!
Whoo! It really is time to go.
Farewell, Scrooge.
Farewell. [laughs]
No, please! Don't leave me here!
I must.
Ooh. I have shown you what was.
Now another will show you what is.
Remember what you have seen, Scrooge.
Remember. Learn.
Change while you still can!
[Jacob] The second, at 2:00.
Hello?
Is there anybody there?
[Scrooge] Strange, annoying, candle lady thing?
Hello?
Huh?
Who dares disturb my slumber?
State thy name and business, puny mortal.
[laughs] I can't…
I can't… I can't keep it up.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. -It was her. She dared me. -[cheerling laughs]
Oh, we do like to have fun here.
Don't worry.
I know who you are.
Come on, bring it in, Ebenezer Scrooge. Bring it in!
-[Scrooge groans] -Welcome, my friend. Welcome.
Welcome where?
Where am I?
When am I?
Oh, you are in the here and now. In the present!
Isn't it just fabulous?
It's fine, I suppose.
From here, I can go anywhere I please.
Just so long as it's happening right now.
And I do so love to visit
your teeny-tiny, tootsy-wootsy, little planet at this time of year.
So much love, generosity, and good cheer!
Which, conversely, brings me to you.
-Me? -Yes, you.
Squeezing, wrenching, grasping, clutching, covetous you!
Secret and solitary as an oyster, you edge along the crowded paths of life
keeping everyone at a distance.
Why, you stopped truly living your life so long ago, you might as well be dead.
Do not presume to tell me how to live my life.
I lead a good life.
I'm a good man. [grunts]

Can you feel it, Scrooge?
Are you ready to live your life, now, in the present,
unencumbered by the weight of the past?
I'm ready.
I'm ready to go home. Thank you very much.
Oh, really?
But the fireworks. We did a whole song and everything.
Well, I'm not giving up on you yet, Ebenezer Scrooge.
Come on. Let's hit the town.
Hit the town? I'll hit something else in a minute.
Dragged from pillar to post in the middle of the night. Huh.
My friends, please. I-I would like to propose a toast.
My friends, please. Oh--
Oh, thank you.
He really is a buffoon, that boy.
There's no need to whisper.
No one can hear or see you.
-[Scrooge gasps] -Lucky them. [laughs]
Please raise your glass and drink to the good health and long life
of my celebrated uncle, Ebenezer Scrooge.
-[crowd mutter] -[woman] Boo.
I know. I know.
But I like old Scrooge.
-No, no, no. No. Come now. I do. I do. -[woman] Why?
Why?
I never met my mother, but my father spoke of her often.
Of her kindness. Her generosity.
It's hard to believe that the woman he described
was that old stick-in-the-mud's little sister. [chuckles]
But his sister she was.
And, by all accounts, she and my uncle were inseparable.
She loved him without reservation, and he, her.
So he can't be all bad.
I have to believe that somewhere in that loathsome old carcass of his,
the man my mother loved is fighting to get out.
I should like to meet him one day.
Which brings me to my next toast of the evening, to my beloved mother.
As I entered the world, you departed.
Here's to the Christmases we never shared, and the sad, short one we did.
Harry, my dear, sweet Harry,
let's not dwell on the sadness in our past,
on those who cannot be with us.
-Or refuse to be. -[cheerling squeaks]
Instead, let us celebrate those who are here.
Hear! Hear!
Everyone, let us honor the past by toasting our present.
To each other. To Christmas.
-To friendship. -[man 1] Hear! Hear!
-[man 2] To friendship. -To friendship.
Oh, for goodness' sake, where are we going now?
[Present] May I present to you the beautiful home of Robert Cratchit Esquire.
He owes these sumptuous surroundings to the generosity of his employer.
I never knew Cratchit had quite so many children.
No? Did you ever ask him?
Mmm. Pure nectar. An elixir fit for Father Christmas himself.
The stuffing's ready, Father.
-[both] And the birdie is plucked. -Tremendous work, my dears.
Roast goose with sage and onion stuffing à la Cratchit.
A legendary gourmet dish.
There's one problem. I'm not sure whether to stuff the goose with the stuffing,
or stuff the stuffing with the goose.
Come now, my love.
It is a lean Christmas, there's no denying that.
But we have each other and we have the children.
We can still make the most of it.
In fact, I do believe this will be the best Cratchit Christmas ever.
[children] Hooray!
Not another toast.
If you please, a toast to those whose generosity
have made possible tomorrow's sumptuous Christmas feast.
Master Timothy and Miss Katherine,
the Christmas-caroling Cratchits, of course.
And Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.
Oh! Scrooge?
What are you trying to do, spoil our Christmas?
But his money paid for the goose, my dear. No, your money paid for the goose.
-If you can even call that a goose. -But he paid me the money.
Because you earned it.
Believe me, you earned that money, Bob.
Mr. Scrooge assures me that times are hard, my dear.
Times are hard. For us, not him.
Nonetheless, he is the founder of our feast, and we should drink to him.
Hear! Hear!
The founder of our feast indeed.
I'd like to give him something to feast on.
He'd have indigestion all January.
[sighs] Children, we shall drink to your father.
For the love and happiness he brings us.
And to our Tiny Tim, for the health we wish him.
And, for the sake of your dear father,
I will even drink to that old miser, Mr. Scrooge.
Long life to him and to us all.
And a merry Christmas to us all.
[children] Merry Christmas!
God bless us.
God bless us, every one.
[children] Merry Christmas!
I think Bob Cratchit's rather fond of me.
So is his wife. Couldn't you tell? [chuckles]
And now, to the triumphant musical climax of this celebration.
Master Timothy, Miss Katherine, would you be so kind?
-No. -[children] Sing, sing!
Go on, love. Sing, sing!
It's embarrassing.
Sing!
I will if Kathy does.

What will become of him?
The future is as much a mystery to me as it is to you.
I can only show you what is.
What's to come if you do not change?
Well, that will soon be revealed by… someone else.
[burps] Oh, excuse me.
Look, friend, there really is no great secret to any of this.
You just have to do the best you can with the time you have.
But you better get started soon.
Because before you know it, all that time you think you have
will run out.
[Jacob] The third, at 3:00.
Well, goodbye, Ebenezer Scroo…
Well, goodbye, Ebenezer Scroo… Ooh! [chuckles]
Would you look at that?
-[Prudence whimpers] -I, uh…
We are no longer in the present.
This is the future.
This is what is yet to come.
Are you still in there, giant?
The fellow in the green robes? Liked life and so forth?
No.
You are something else entirely.
You don't speak?
Your colleagues were rather fond of speaking.
More than I would have liked.
So you are the one that will show me what awaits if I do not change my ways.
Yes?
So I should change, should I?
Why? Tell me.
I live my life as well as I can.
I have my faults, but who does not, truly?
Are all others I've been shown this night without blame?
Am I the only one with the power to change my life?
To change the lives of others?
Well? Am I?
Tell me!
Oh, very well.
Lead on.
Show me what bleak future my wickedness has wrought.
And, yes, nobody can see or hear me, I know.
[Tom Jenkins] Ladies and gentlemen,
good morning to you on this joyous Christmas Day.
We are gathered here as a group, united by a common bond.
Namely, our feelings of gratitude
to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.
-[crowd cheer] -I know that fellow.
Jenkins. Owes me 25… No, 50 pounds.
I must say he looks uncommonly happy for a man so deep in debt.
In fact, most of this rabble owes me money. Shush. Shush.
While we are all deeply moved,
those of us who Mr. S was so kind as to lend money to over the years
are particularly grateful for what he has done for us today.
-[crowd cheers] -What have I done? Certainly not forgiven their debts.
As your predecessor said,
you are showing me what will happen if I do not change.
I did not change, yet I am celebrated.
And rightly so.
These creatures have finally come to their senses. That's it. Ha!
It would seem the ordeal to which I have been subjected
has been a complete waste of my time. And yours, my silent friend.
No matter. All's well that ends well, as they say.
[woman] ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪
That's right, Prudence. They're cheering for me.

Ha, ha! Oh, yes, indeed.
This is far more agreeable than what your predecessors had me endure.
So what's next, friend?
Tiny Tim.
-No. -It's all right.
Cratchit, times are hard, and my financial burdens are considerable.
-[Bob] My boy needs medicine. -[Cratchit Sr.] It's Christmas Eve.
-[Bob] My boy needs medicine. -[Cratchit Sr.] It's Christmas Eve. [Scrooge] Cratchit, you do nothing but trouble me.
Should I add to them by paying for the upkeep of your entire family?
I must go now, my little man.
I promised your mother I'd help with Christmas dinner, but…
I'll come and see you again tomorrow. Same time, all right?
[sobs] Oh, dear Tim.
-[Bob cries] -Come on now, Father.
Till tomorrow then. Sleep well, my love. Sweet dreams.
I…
I could have done more.
I could have done something.
Poor Tiny Tim.
Friend, you have shown me a Christmas yet to come
that mixes great joy with greater sorrow.
Tell me, is this what will be,
or what may be?
If I were to change,
would all this still come to pass?
[man] Here.
-[Tom laughs] -Gentlemen, please. Sorry, Father. But you reap what you sow.
Is that not what your Good Book says?
I wouldn't hang about for any mourners. Nobody's sorry to see this one go.
Nobody who doesn't walk on all fours anyway.
Merry Christmas.
And thank you very much. [laughs]
[Tom sighs happily] Come on. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
[Jacob] Scrooge…
No.
No.
Spare me.
Let me return.
I will not become this man
whose death is the cause of such celebration.
Why show me this if I am past all hope?
Am I? Truly?
If… If I am beyond salvation, then so be it.
But, please, the boy need not die.
Not when I have it in my power to help him.
I beg of you, spare me for this reason, if nothing more.
I swear to honor Christmas in my heart and keep it there the whole year through.
I will learn from the past, live only in the present,
and strive for a better future.
For all!
Tell me I may yet strike the writing from the boy's cross.
Please.
Please, tell me!
No!
[Scrooge] No!

[Scrooge] Prudence?
Prudence!
[gasps] I'm in my bedroom.
Oh, it's Prudence.
Well, was I… Was I merely dreaming?
-You there! -[man] Huh?
I-I say, what day is it, my fine fellow?
Um, Tuesday, I think.
Ha, no.
Is it Christmas Day?
Well, of course it is.
[grunts] Takes all kinds, I suppose.
It's Christmas, Prudence! [laughs]
-[Prudence barks] -It's Christmas, and I'm alive! [laughs]
Wait, what time is it?
I'm glad Isabel found the happiness she deserved.
Perhaps…
Perhaps it's not too late for me to find my own.
-[sighs contentedly] -I did. I swear. I said-- -Hello there. -[girl] What?
What is it? We didn't do nothing, Mr. Scrooge.
No, not yet, you haven't. [laughs]
I have some errands for you to run. I can make it worth your while.
Errands?
Thank you, Prudence. There's a good girl. [boy 1] Ah, ah, ah, ahh!
Mind how you go.
[girl] Mr. Scrooge, sir.
Almost done.
Magnificent. What wonderful children you all are.
And, well, sorry to ask again,
but you're sure you managed to get everything on the list?
Yes, sir.
The butchers and the bakers thought I was having a laugh.
But then I gave 'em the checks. They'll be here soon.
Splendid. And you did deliver the invitations? All of them?
Of course.
No guarantee they'll come, though. It is very short notice.
[laughs] Quite. Uh, you are a clever young lady, aren't you?
As promised, a gold sovereign for each of you.
Boys, since it's Christmas, I ain't even gonna take my cut.
That's the spirit. And you'll all stay for dinner, won't you?
Won't you?
-[all] Yay! -[barking]
Ha! And help yourself to a gift.

Oh, and give my best to your mother, won't you?
Thank you. Thank you very much.

Ladies, 1,000 pounds for your fund, this and every Christmas to come.
[both] Oh, such generosity.
It's the doll from my mother's picture. Uncle, I can't accept this.
You must.
It's a gift from an old fool who regrets all the Christmases we never shared.
[Harry] Oh, Uncle.
[laughs] Thank you.
-"Business partners"? -Yes, Bob. If you'll have me, that is.
Let's build a brighter future for the Cratchits together.
-What do you say? -[Bob] I say yes!
God bless you, Mr. Scrooge.

or Coal Creek, West Virginia were, they probably couldn't point 'em out to you on a map.
they probably couldn't point 'em out to you on a map.
But I guarantee, they'd be there all the same.
How and why so many people from those two piddlin' places on that map
could end up connected has a lot to do with our story.
Some would claim it was just dumb luck,
while others might swear it was God's intention.
But I'd say with the way things turned out,
it was a little bit of both.
In 1957, it'd take someone approximately ten hours
to drive from Coal Creek to a paper mill town
in southern Ohio called Meade.
Once you got to Meade, Knockemstiff was only a short drive away.
Four hundred or so people lived in Knockemstiff in 1957,
nearly all of them connected by blood by one godforsaken calamity or another,
be it lust or necessity or just plain ignorance.
The Russells had rented the house on top of the Mitchell flats for nine years now.
But most of the neighbors down below still considered them outsiders.
[boy] Hey, Dad.
[man] You're coming with me today, boy.
[narrator] Years ago, Willard had fitted together a weathered cross above a fallen tree
a weathered cross above a fallen tree in a small clearing behind his house.
He came every morning and evening to talk to God.
It seemed to his son that his father fought the Devil all the time.
[Willard] Now, you pray on...
what happened today.
Now, remember, be honest.
No bullshittin', he'll know.
[narrator] When he prayed,
his mind would often drift back to the war in the South Pacific
and the day that he and a couple of other soldiers came across the body
and the day that he and a couple of other soldiers came across the body of Gunnery Sergeant Miller Jones.
[Willard] Holy shit.
[man] What's it say?
Miller Jones.
-[man] Fuck! -[Miller gasping]
[man] We gotta do something. The Japs just left him up there.
[bus driver] Next stop, Meade, Ohio.
-Please. -Thank you.
[narrator] Right before Willard fell in love,
the man whose seat he took would also meet his match.
I'm so sorry. I forgot my damn keys.
Okay. Guy by the window counter.
So, what'll you be having?
Ham and cheese.
[whispers] Ham and cheese.
-Okay. -You're a little green on the job.
-That obvious, huh? -[man chuckles]
My brother just got me the job, so...
Ham and cheese.
You take pictures?
[narrator] In the years to come, Carl would call Sandy "the bait,"
and she'd called him "the shooter."
Only when I find a smile pretty enough to photograph, that is.
[narrator] Both called their victims "the models."
I'll have to think about it.
-[door chimes open] -[waitress] What can I get ya?
Meatloaf is the blue plate special.
Um--Just coffee and a doughnut.
-Thank you. -[door chimes open]
-Looks really fine. -[manager] No!
No!
-Get out. I told you last time. -Come on, now.
[manager] Next time, the cops will drag you out.
-[waitress] Excuse me. -Get out!
I'm just gonna take my break outside.
[homeless man] All right.
-All right! -[door clanks shut]
[man] Thank you. God bless you.
Did you need anything else?
Um... No, I'm fine.
That was nice, what you did.
Some people just need a little help once in a while.
You know what I mean?
Yep.
-Hmm. -You back home from the war?
Nah, I'm just passing through.
On my way to West Virginia.
My people are from Coal Creek.
That's too bad.
You have a nice face.
Well... [exhales]
It's nice to meet you.
It's nice to meet you, too.
[man] Is it true the Japs ate their own dead?
-[Willard] Where'd you hear that? -Read it in the paper.
-[sighs] Lord, that's good stuff. -Mm-hmm.
-I got three more in my kit. -Yeah?
Yep. And I've got something else for you, Uncle Earskell.
Now, this here is supposed to be the gun
that Hitler used to blow his brains out.
[scoffs] You still got the bullshit in you, ain't you?
-You think that guy lied to me? -[chuckles] Yeah.
That is a nice gift, though.
-Yeah. -Thank you.
It's German.
That's a Luger.
[woman crying] Oh, come here! Oh...
[sighs] Oh, Lord, I was so worried.
It wasn't that bad.
It wasn't that bad, Mama.
I would ask you to get down and thank Jesus with me,
but I can smell the liquor on your breath.
I know.
I felt the need to celebrate.
I'm in love.
-What's this girl's name? -[Earskell clears throat]
Well, I ain't never got her name.
-[Earskell laughs] -Earskell.
You ain't got her name?
I left her a dollar tip, though.
[Earskell] A what?
For a cup of coffee?
[Earskell] Well, she won't forget that.
[woman] I know you like this waitress.
Oh, but there's a-- a girl from church I want you to meet.
a girl from church I want you to meet.
-I don't wanna go to church, Mama. -[shushing]
You get some rest. [grunts] You'll feel better in the morning.
[narrator] Though he couldn't look at a cross without thinking of Miller Jones,
he never told anyone about the crucified Marine.
-[man] Welcome. -[woman] Willard.
-[man] Welcome. -[woman] Willard. Willard, I've asked Helen to sit with us. Go on, Helen.
-Nice to meet you. -[Willard] Hi, how are you?
Willard just got back, Helen.
-You-- -Welcome home.
It's been four days.
[narrator] Willard didn't know that Emma had promised God
that in exchange for bringing him home safe,
she'd make sure he married Helen Hatton.
The girl's family burned up in a house fire
leaving the poor thing all alone.
[pastor] Good gracious.
It's hot, ain't it? -[crowd] Amen. -It's bound to get hotter.
-[crowd] Amen. -It's bound to get hotter.
Right now, we got two boys from over in Topperville
-gonna lead the service today. -[man] All right.
And from what folks tell me, they got a right good message.
So, let's bring 'em up. Boys, come on up here.
-Let's make 'em feel welcome. -[woman] Oh!
[man] Welcome, boys. Welcome.
See that one in the wheelchair?
Drank too much strychnine or antifreeze, or something is why he can't walk.
So good to see you. Thank you for coming.
Testing their fate, they call it.
It's going too far, the way I see it.
Thank you, Reverend.
My name is Roy Laferty,
and this here is my cousin, Theodore.
Now, the Holy Ghost is going to visit this little church
that bears his sacred name!
♪ Are you washed ♪ ♪ In the blood ♪
[Roy] Come on, Theodore!
[Roy] What is it you're most afraid of?
Because if your worst fear is rats, well..
Satan'll make sure you get your fill of them. Mm.
-[man] That's right, tell 'em, boy. -Brothers and sisters...
you'll see them,
eating away at you whilst you lay there
unable to lift a single finger.
And it won't ever cease.
A million years in eternity.
Now, don't even try and figure that up.
[man] Come on, Lord.
Ain't no human head big enough to calculate misery like that!
-[crowd murmurs] -[chuckles] Yeah?
And really, brothers and sisters, ain't no man ever been evil enough,
-not even that Hitler fella... -That's right.
...come up with the ways Satan's gonna make them sinners pay
-come the Judgment Day! -[crowd] Yeah!
Yeah! Yes, that's right, my friends!
Yeah! Yes, that's right, my friends! [woman] Yes, sir! Praise the Lord!
Amen.
Let me tell you something, friends.
Before I found the Holy Ghost...
I was scared plumb to death of spiders.
-Ain't that right, Theodore? -Mm-hmm.
[Roy] I was a runt,
hiding under my mother's long skirts,
spiders crawling through my dreams...
...laying eggs in my nightmares.
They was...
hang in their webs everywhere...
waitin'.
I had fear in me all the time, awake or asleep, didn't matter.
Now, that's what hell is like, brothers and sisters!
[woman] Praise the Lord.
[Roy] I got no rest from them devils!
[crowd] Amen!
Not until the Lord gave me strength!
[crowd] Amen!
Brothers and sisters... [woman] Whoo!
...behold!
The Lord looks out for me now!
[man] Amen!
Mark my word, people!
The Spirit will take away your fears if you're willing!
[Willard] Them spiders, sure was a nice touch.
I ain't gonna sleep tonight as it is.
I wish Helen left with us.
Well, she might have come with us,
if you'd paid her a little more attention.
The right man would make a good life for Helen.
[narrator] Emma was concerned something bad might happen
if she couldn't keep her promise to God.
Helen did, in fact, meet the man she would marry that afternoon.
Bless me, Reverend.
Bless me.
And Willard's mind was already hundreds of miles away. ♪ Will the arrow point my way ♪
Be right there.
I ain't no rush.
-Why, if it isn't-- -I never got your name.
[manager] Charlotte, second call on chicken over peas.
Be right back with you, hon.
[man] See, full-time, I'm a lawyer.
-Real estate isn't my business, but... -[dog barking]
I own a few of these properties around Meade, Knockemstiff.
Real long-term investments.
There aren't any sinks in here, Mr. Dunlap.
[Dunlap] Ain't no running water, missy. There's a well out back.
What do you think, Arvin?
[narrator] Though he hadn't talked to God in years,
not a single petition or word of praise
since he'd come across the crucified Marine.
Willard could feel it welling up inside him now,
the urge to get right with his maker
before something bad happened to his family.

Where'd you go?
I was just looking the land over.
What you think?
-It's nice. -[baby cooing]
Rent seems fair for what we get.
We keep saving,
we could probably buy it.
Wouldn't that be something? [chuckles]
Arvin have a home of his own.
I never did have that.
[Willard] Things are good, Mama.
We found a place in a holler called Knockemstiff.
[man] Let's move! [Willard] Arvin just turned one, and he has lots of grass to play on now.
[Willard] Arvin just turned one, and he has lots of grass to play on now.
We're saving money to buy the house one day.
So things are gonna be tight for a while.
We'll get to you as soon as possible.
Your son, Willard.
P.S...
I got the urge to pray again.
"We'll get to you as soon as possible. Your son Willard.
P.S. I got the urge to pray again."
-Sure you don't mind watching Lenora? -[Emma] Sure.
Don't mind. Hand her over here. Where y'all going?
-We just thought we'd take a ride. -[Emma grunts]
-Get out of that little house for a bit. -[Emma chuckles]
[narrator] Though she didn't know it, she'd never see Lenora again.
Seven years later, they found Helen's body buried in the woods.
I'm thinking we take a walk.
Be fine to pray outside and adore them trees.
Whatever you want, Roy, but what about Theodore?
Theodore will be all right sitting in the car.
That's right. Don't y'all worry about me.
Maybe I oughta take me a nap.
Just be you and me, sweetheart.
[narrator] In 1957,
Arvin Eugene Russell was nine years old.
He was the only kid on the school bus who wasn't somebody's relation.
Three days before, he'd come home with another black eye.
You're coming out back with me today, boy.
You got a deposit to make, sir?
-[Arvin] C'mere, Jack. -[Willard] Second time.
Those little shits keep picking on him. It ain't right.
Them boys might be bigger than you.
But the next time one of them starts his shit,
I want you to finish it.
You understand?
Yes, sir.
Now, you pray on what happened today.
And remember,
be honest, no bullshittin'.
He'll know.
[man] Hell, they having a little revival meetin'.
Shit, I'm thinking now'd be a good time to pay his old lady a visit.
[Arvin] Dad?
This here's the Lord's time, not nobody else's.
[man 1] Probably in bed keeping it warm for me.
[man 2] Shut the fuck up, Lucas.
[Lucas] Wouldn't you take a piece of that?
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. This thing's getting heavy.
[narrator] Despite Arvin's fears,
the two poachers didn't head to his home that day.

-Get off the couch, Jack. -Can Jack come?
-Come on, Jack. -[Charlotte] Hey.
Will you get me some sugar?
Roll up your window.
[Lucas] Motherfucker!
-[man] -Oh, shit! Hey, take it easy! -[man 2] He's gonna fuckin' kill him!
[man 2] Come on! Get off him!
[man] That's enough! You're gonna kill him!
[man] Oh, shit!
-Stubbs! -Stubbs, get out here, man!
-Get out of here! -Come on, give me a hand.
Get the fuck out of here!
Now you remember what I told you?
About them boys on the bus that gave you the black eye?
That's what I meant.
[groans] Just gotta pick the right time.
Yes, sir.
There's a lot of no good sons of bitches out there.
-[breathing heavily] -More than a hundred?
Yeah, at least that many.
How about I buy you a candy bar, huh?
We gotta get some sugar for Mama too.
[Willard] Mm-hmm. [narrator] Arvin would often think back on this day
as the best one he ever spent with his father.
So what kind of candy bar you gonna get, huh?
Um... a Charleston Chew, yeah.
Mama?
Mama?
Mama?
-Mama? -[Jack whines, barks]
Dad!
-[dog whines] -Mama!
[Willard] No! Charlotte!
Listen to me. Charlotte!
-[Willard] What are you saying? -[man] The test results aren't good.
The morphine will continue to dampen the pain but...
there's no way we can destroy that cancer.
[Willard] Let's talk downstairs.
Now... them doctors can't do your mom any good.
But He can save her.
Yeah, if we just pray hard enough.
The Lord can do anything
-if you just ask him right. -[Jack whining]
Okay?
Now hold them tight.
And pray like you mean it.
Lord,
please save my wife.
Destroy this cancer inside her, Lord.
We need your help, Lord.
We need your help, and I know you can do it.
I know you can do it.
Please Lord, please.
Pray, God dammit.
-You want your mama to die? -No, sir.
Then pray!
Lord, please save my mama!
-Clean the cancer inside of her! -[Willard] We need your help!
Now you pray, now! You hear me?
Now you pray, now! You hear me? Yes, Lord!
Save my mama, Lord!
Please clean the cancer inside of her!
And don't be crying, you hear? Don't be crying!
-Pray like you mean it! Lord! -[Jack whining, barking]
-Pray like you mean it! Lord! -[Jack whining, barking] Spare my wife!
[shakily] Don't take her from me.
Don't take her from me.
[crying] Don't take her from me.
Everything's gonna be okay.
God'll hear us.
And he'll take care of Mama.
You good, honey.
[woman] We got cozy rooms in the back if you need some company.
I'm fine.
[narrator] It occurred to him that maybe something more was expected
than just his prayers and sincerity.
God had a tendency of asking men to make sacrifices
in order to prove their faith.
Dad, no!
Dad, no!
Dad!
Lord, this here is my boy's dog.
We loved him.
He loved him.
Now you take him!
Bring him back!
You save Charlotte!
It's gonna be all right, Arvin.
It's gonna be all right.
[Willard] I'm thinking we might take us a trip.
Go down and visit your grandma in Coal Creek.
You can meet Uncle Earskell.
And that girl that's living with them...
She's just a little younger than you.
Maybe we'll stay for a while.
[Willard] Arvin.
[Arvin] I wish you were here, Jack.
When Dad goes to sleep...
I'm going to bring you down and give you a proper burial.
Just like they gave to Mama.
I'm not doing that no more, you hear me?
I ain't prayin'!
You hear me?
I said I'm not doing that no more.
-You hear me? -[loud thud]
There's money to be made if a man of the law is careful and...
doesn't get a big head.
I wanna get out of my house, Lee.
I told you, sweetie,
it's only matter of time.
And no more parking lots.
No more Pepsi cups. Just a big ole bed.
Yeah.
People like me in this town.
-You know that, honey. -Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
I'll get myself elected.
Get a...
-cushy place up in Brewer Heights. -Mm-hmm.
You see them...
That was good. [sighs]
-You get it all in the cup? -Yeah.
[dispatcher] Any cars out around Knockemstiff? Over.
Deputy Bodecker around those parts?
We got a call from Hank over at--
-Fuck. -Can you get over and check that out?
-Can I come with you? -Are you crazy?
-Come on. -Didn't you hear anything I said?
I've got an election to think about.
[Lee] Well?
Better not be one of them goddamn window peepers you keep calling about.
[man] I wish it was. It's about this boy's Daddy.
Well, what is it, son?
He's dead.
And they buried his poor mama today.
It's a damn shame, it is.
Is that blood on your face?
[Arvin] No.
Somebody left us a pie.
-[Arvin] He's right there. -[Lee] Jesus.
-[Arvin] He's right there. -[Lee] Jesus. What's that smell?
God dammit, boy.
What the hell is this?
It's a prayer log.
Prayer log?
Yeah.
But it don't work too good.
[Helen] Lenora?
Mama's coming, Lenora.
-It's all right. -[Roy screaming indistinctly]
Hey, it's all right. [tutting]
-[shushes] It's all right. -[knocking on door]
Your dinner's ready.
[Roy] I've got the Holy Ghost in me! I'm ready to use it!
Lord!
-Speak! -Roy?
I've been thinking...
Maybe the Lord wants you to come out into the light.
I mean, how can you be close to God stuck in there?
The Lord don't like dark places.
Roy?
[narrator] Roy'd been bitten on the cheek by a spider while preaching a sermon,
and his head had puffed up as big as a pumpkin.
All right, then.
Enjoy your dinner.
[narrator] In the time it took the swelling to go down,
he'd become convinced that the Lord was testing him
to see if he was ready to take on something bigger.
He'd stayed in the dark closet for a fortnight waiting on an answer.
He smelled worse than a truck-stop shitter.
[Roy] Lord, is that you?
Oh, no, I'm not scared!
-[Theodore humming] -[Roy] I trust in you!
-[door opens] -Glory to God!
I hear you! Yes, I am here!
Helen. Oh, it's so good to see you, honey.
-Been a while, ain't it? -Is everything all right?
Oh, everything's fine now.
Uh, Roy finally got himself straightened out.
Well, that's good to hear.
[Helen] "P.S. I got the urge to pray again."
-Sure you don't mind watching Lenora? -[Emma] Sure.
Don't mind. Hand her over here. Where y'all going?
-We just thought we'd take a ride. -[Emma grunts]
-Get out of that little house for a bit. -[Emma chuckles]
-There you go. -[smooches]
Yes.
This spot looks about as good a place as any, don't it?
Yes.
The Lord is here, sweetheart.
I can feel him.
God loves you, Helen.
Lenora...
God...
I've heard your word.
Helen...
I resurrect you...
with the grace of God in me...
I resurrect you!
Return!
God!
It is time!
Resurrect! Return!
Return, Spirit! Resurrect!
God!
[Roy] Resur--
God!
Resurrect!
Come on, now!
Come on, now, res--
I could tell the police what happened.
That it was an accident.
[Theodore] You stabbed your wife in the neck with a screwdriver.
Tried to bring her back from the dead and then buried her body.
That ain't an accident, Roy.
That sounds like a crazy person who killed his wife.
Keep driving south.
If we stay off highways, we should be fine.
[groans softly] Where are we, Roy?
Roy?
Roy?
Roy?
[man] Where about?
C-Coal Creek, West Virginia.
We'll get you close enough, son.
I'm Carl, by the way, this here's Sandy.
Huh? Ain't she somethin'?
Mister, I do appreciate this.
I don't understand people that won't pick up strangers.
It should be a good thing, helping someone out.
You sound like a Christian.
Carl used to teach at Sunday school.
Didn't you, babe?
That's right.
That's right.
What's your name, sweetie?
It's Roy.
Roy Laferty.
So what's in West Virginia, Roy?
Going back home to see my daughter.
Hey, come on.
I wanna show you something.
What?
I'm giving you a good thing here, buddy.
Come on.
Said I'm giving you a good thing here, buddy.
I wanna get some shots of your ugly old mug sitting next to a pretty lady.
Come on, she likes lanky old studs like yourself. Come on.
What's going on here, mister?
Oh, come on, Jesus Christ, huh?
Pay attention. It's like I said, you're gonna fuck my wife
Pay attention. It's like I said, you're gonna fuck my wife and I'm gonna take some pictures, that's all.
Your wife?
Come on.
I've never heard of such a thing.
I thought you was a good Christian--
Shut the fuck up and get that welfare suit off, son.
-Jesus. -Well, I've been run through the wringer!
Do you really want these hands touching you?
Oh, come on, sweetie.
We'll just take a few pictures and then the big dumb bastard will leave us alone.
Woman... look at me.
-[Carl] Do what I say, you son of a bitch. -[gun cocks]
No, I ain't.
[Carl] Oh, Jesus.
Carl, maybe we should just get out of here.
Oh, forget it. Jesus. -[Sandy] I'm cold, Carl. -I know it's cold
-[Sandy] I'm cold, Carl. -I know it's cold
[narrator] Roy looked up at the clouds drifting by and wondered if that's what death would be like, just floating away in the air.
if that's what death would be like, just floating away in the air.
He preached on it for years, but still didn't know what to expect.
Just one thing.
Yeah, what's that?
Her name is Lenora.
What the fuck you talking about?
My little girl.
-Lenor-- -[gunshot]
[Carl] Come on. [narrator] This was still early days for the pair,
and Carl was still working out the particulars.
[Carl] God damn...
He realized that he would have to get more selective with his models
if he wanted to keep Sandy onboard.
[Carl] Get some shots off down there while the light's still good.
[man] Good day, ma'am.
-You Emma Russell? -Yes.
[man] I have some papers for you to sign and the boy here's all yours.
Here, let me have that.
[Emma] Arvin?
Here, you give me that heavy old bag.
Oh, sweetie,
we are so happy you're here.
This here is your...
your Uncle Earskell.
Hey, there.
This is Lenora.
Lenora is your stepsister.
Hi, Arvin.
Hi.
[Emma] Here we go.
[Earskell] Oh, here we go.
-[Lenora] Happy birthday, Arvin. -[Emma] Happy birthday, honey.
-[Lenora] Happy birthday! -[Emma] Oh, no.
[Lenora] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
Happy birthday.
All right.
[Emma] Make a wish before that candle burns out.
[Earskell] It looks like a dandy cake.
-Arvin! -All right, hang on.
[Arvin] Thank you.
Well...
This was your daddy's.
[Emma] What's that?
[Easrkell] That's Willard's gun he gave me.
I figure it's time to pass it on.
That's a German Luger.
Brought back from the war.
I... got no use for handguns myself.
But I figure he'd want you to have it.
[sniffles] It's the best present I ever got. Thank you, Uncle Earskell.
Shotgun's what'll do you good.
Maybe, but I don't have anything else of his, so...
thank you. [sniffles]
Time does pass.
[boy] Get down there.
[narrator] Boys in school liked to pick on Lenora for her pious manner
[narrator] Boys in school liked to pick on Lenora for her pious manner and pinched face.
[boy] You're so damn ugly, I'd need a sack over your head just to get a hard-on.
[narrator] Gene Dinwoodie, Tommy Matson, and Orville Buckman
had managed to corner her by the dumpster behind school.
[boy] Probably fucked your brother, you brother fucker.
-[boy] Come on, get him! -[Lenora] Please stop! Stop!
God dammit! [grunts]
-[Arvin] Get the fuck off me! -[Lenora] Stop it!
[Arvin] Get off of me! Fuck!
[narrator] Arvin loved her like his own sister.
-[boy] Sister fucker. -He would do anything to protect her.
No matter what the weather was,
Lenora would visit her mother's grave after school.
Some days she'd even read the Bible out loud,
and imagine her mother was listening.
Though he wasn't one for praying
Arvin would often drive her and keep her company.
[Lenora] Arvin?
It was a sight you didn't end up in the hospital.
Yeah, well, there's a lot of no good sons of bitches out there. [grunts]
Well, Lord, Arvin, you've been saying that almost since the day I met you.
You know, that's because it's true.
Maybe you should try praying for 'em then. Would that hurt none?
You already do enough for all of us, and where's it doing you much good, huh?
You know what would do you good?
To not be wandering behind school by your own self, like I told you.
Fuckin' Gene Dinwoodie.
Do you ever think about...
how we ended up orphans living in the same house?
No.
Besides, you might not even be an orphan.
As far as everybody around here is concerned
your daddy's probably still out there somewhere alive and kicking.
Fuck, he might even come over that hill any day now, dancing a jig.
[chuckles] I hope so.
I pray every day he will.
Even if it means he did something?
I've already forgiven him.
We could start over.
That's crazy.
No, it's not.
What about your father?
What about him?
I know what my daddy did.
Well...
forgivin' him...
if he could come back.
Well, shut your mouth. We both know that ain't never gonna happen.
I'm sorry for bringing it up.
[sighs] It's all right.
You know, I appreciate you always coming with me.
I know you'd probably rather be doing something else.
We're kin. We gotta look out for each other.
[man] Lenora! Arvin!
C'mere!
I might be gone a while.
I'll be praying for you.
[man] In the meantime...
my sister's boy from down in Tennessee
is gonna come up and take my place.
He just graduated from one of them... Bible colleges.
Well, I would appreciate it if you all would try and make him feel welcome.
Tell your grandmama I'm asking folks to bring a dish next sermon.
[Lenora] Of course.
[man 2] What you got planned after school, Arvin?
Cliff Baker says he can get me on the crew laying blacktop
on the Greenbrier stretch off Route 60.
[man 2] Yeah.
I'm probably just gonna do that. You?
Oh, my old man's holding me here.
Better than getting shipped off to Vietnam I expect.
Yeah, I suppose so.
[Emma] Everyone says they like the way I do them, but I--
they like the way I do them, but I--
Well, just get him a big steak then.
You know I can't afford anything like that.
Grandma, quit worrying about it. He's just a preacher.
Anyway, everyone says ain't no one doesn't like you, you know that.
So chicken livers it is.
It's nice to meet you, Reverend.
[Emma repeating] It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, Reverend. -Nice to meet you.
♪ In the little valley town... ♪
[narrator] Emma was known as one of the best cooks in the county.
When people praised her food,
she always told them that she couldn't fry an egg
until she found the Lord.
And that he was the one that guided her hand
and made everything turn out good.
[sighs] All right.
My heart's in my stomach.
That hat. You know better. ♪ ...the mountains high above ♪
Hello there.
Pleased to meet you, Reverend.
Emma Russell.
Nice to meet you too. What you got there?
[narrator] As Preston Teagardin swished the juice from the chicken livers around in his mouth,
he felt the stirrings of a sermon coming on.
Blessed...
are they who hunger... and thirst...
for righteousness. ♪ Bless, oh Lord, this celebration ♪
Hope you like them, Reverend.
[narrator] Preston loved the way people listened to him
and held onto every word. [Preston] Hmm.
[narrator] He was grateful his mother decided all those years ago
that he was going to be a preacher.
He'd never win a fist fight,
but he could recite the Book of Revelation in his sleep.
Friends...
there's no doubt...
we're all humble people gathered here.
-[woman] Amen. -[man] Amen.
Y'all have been awful nice to me
and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for the welcome.
-[man] Yes. -[churchgoers whispering]
But friends...
the poor soul... that brung in them chicken livers on that beat-up plate...
let's just say I'm inspired to preach on it for a minute before we eat.
Sure...
some of us are better off than others.
And I see...
plenty of white meat and red meat
laid out on this table.
And I suspect that the folks that carried them platters in
-eat mighty good sometimes. -[man] Yes, sir.
But poor people...
got to bring what they can afford.
So them organs...
is a sign to me...
telling me that I should,
as the new preacher of this church,
sacrifice myself.
so that y'all can have a share of the good meat tonight.
And that's what I'm going to do, friends.
I'm going to eat these organs.
'Cause I model myself on the good Lord Jesus
whenever he gives me the chance.
And today...
he's blessed me with another opportunity
-to follow in his footsteps. -[churchgoers] Amen.
Now, don't you worry about that pus-gutted blowhard.
I bet he ain't got two nickels to rub together.
I never been so embarrassed in all my life.
I could've crawled right under the table.
-All right, I'm gonna go talk to him. -No, Arvin.
None of that.
He sure ain't the preacher I was hoping for.
Grandma, that ain't no preacher. He's as bad as they got on the damn radio.
Heck, I bet he just wanted them chicken livers all for his own self.
That's why he did that.
You see the way he was gobbling them down.
You shouldn't talk like that, Arvin.
Preacher Teagardin wouldn't be here if the Lord hadn't sent him.
[Arvin] That preacher's a little flashy.
Are you not coming?
No, I got some things to do before we go home.
Can't we go do them after I see Mama?
No, you go on, I'll be back.
Go on.
[radio announcer] ...stand on the verge of a big breakthrough.
God has said in the next few years, we stand on the verge of paradise.
But there's something wrong.
And I'm gonna tell you, we've got to have prayer power
and spiritual power.
In south Vietnam, soldiers fight with arms.
but now our spirit...
[Preston] Who is it out there?
Lenora Laferty, Preacher Teagardin.
Girl, you been crying?
It's nothing.
I just get down sometimes--
The kids at school, they like to tease,
and I ain't gonna have family there come next year.
I was like you when I was your age.
Full of the Lord.
Some of them other kids just... came down hard on me.
What did you do about it?
Well...
it was a rough time.
They was just jealous.
Envy.
Brings out the worst in people.
Especially the young ones.
I don't know if you have anywhere you gotta be.
But, uh...
maybe we can take a drive.
There's a quiet place I found I like to go and pray on things.
[narrator] Like his father years before,
Arvin had always been careful about picking his time.
He knew he'd stand a better chance
if he didn't try to take on all the dirty bastards at once. [door opens]
[woman moaning] What was that?
Nothing. It must not have got shut all the way.
Let's get them bloomers off, come on.
You-- Close that door!
Goddamn better be worth it.
-[Arvin] You piece of shit! -[girl screams]
[girl] Stop it!
-[both grunting] -[Arvin] Motherfucker!
Hey, Orville, will you start it up, man? I don't think it's the spark plugs.
No. Hey, Gene, you want another Twinkie?
I'm all right, thank you.
Wait--
Wait! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
[Arvin] Want your fuckin' Twinkie now? Is that what you want?
[boy] No!
You touch my sister again...
I'll kill you.
Do you understand me?
[wheezing] Yes.
-Do you understand me? -I'm so sorry. [wheezing]
Now, we can feel the Lord our here, can't we?
It's kind of you to come all this way.
Lenora...
have you truly opened yourself to the Lord with...
Preacher Sykes or...
any other preacher?
Once...
Reverend Sykes wept with me.
That's not my meaning.
Have you shown yourself
as the Lord made you?
You mean in my birthday suit? No.
-No? -No.
To show yourself
as the Lord made his first children,
is to truly turn yourself to him...
and his witnessing of it.
Now, that's courage itself.
Meaning I take off my clothes?
Come on and pray with me.
Lord, Lenora is showing herself to you.
See her, Lord, as you made her.
She presents herself to you now.
Give her the strength.
We are together
before the Lord.
Amen.
Amen.
Sorry I didn't come today.
It's okay.
I know there's other things you wanna be doing probably.
[Lenora] So, I can come on my own from now on.
[narrator] Like her mother years ago,
Lenora felt the same force that drew Helen to Roy Laferty.
The girl imagined that she could touch the love emanating from the preacher.
♪ But leave me tomorrow ♪ ♪ Wo-wow ♪ -♪ You've hurt me enough today ♪ -[sniffles, sighs]
Thirty-three to Athens, 50 to Clarksville...
Seventy-nine North to Pittsburgh.
Thirty-three, 50, 79.
Thirty-three, 50, 79.
Thirty-three, 50, 79.
Fuck you, Carl!
Shit.
Shit.
[narrator] It was the summer of 1965,
and the couple were getting ready for what would be their fourteenth road trip.
Carl had decided long ago
that young, good-looking hitchhikers were the best.
What the fuck is going on out here? [sighs]
Couldn't sleep.
And you went outside for...
Thought I'd pack the limousine early.
We don't pack early, Sandy, that's a rule.
-You fucking around? -No.
-Work? -No.
I gotta go into town for business tomorrow.
Think I wanna drive around in a car full of bags?
Buying a camera ain't business.
I'm coming, God dammit!
-[man] I'll break in if you don't answer. -Jesus.
-You don't look too good. -I was asleep.
What do you want?
What are you looking for?
Stop tearing my damn kitchen apart.
You got any candy?
Jane got you sober again? [scoffs]
Going somewhere?
Not that it's any of your business, big brother,
but I'm going on a little vacation.
North Carolina.
Why are you here, Lee?
I've been getting a lot of calls from people about
girls selling snatch out of Tecumseh.
They even mentioned your name a couple times.
That's horseshit.
I got another election coming up, Sandy.
Ol' Matthew's out there doing anything he can to try to make me look bad.
Is Carl the one pimping you? That fat son of a bitch?
No, he's working, making deliveries.
Deliveries?
For who?
Hell if I know.
But he's bringing home money that I don't gotta ask you for.
Is it Leroy?
Get the fuck out of here, Lee.
[sighs] Son of a bitch has it coming.
Just leave off the horn until after the election, you understand?
Don't act like you do nothing wrong.
I'm the law around here, little sister.
And that makes all the difference.
[narrator] Cody Hamilton,
a 20-year-old carpenter out fishing early one morning in West Virginia.
What the fuck are you doing, Sandy?
-[door opens] -[woman] Hey, Lee. Sandy's off.
Leroy's private space owns up half this dump.
I'm gonna inspect those whore rooms.
[woman] Lee, ain't nothin' there.
Let me by.
Lawman.
[man] When the man who puts extra money in your pockets asks why you're as red as a newborn baby,
you tell him who the whore is.
[narrator] Bodecker believed people were like dogs:
once they start digging, they don't wanna stop.
First, it would just be that the Sheriff had a whore for a sister,
and after that, all the bribes and other shit that had piled up
since he'd first pinned on a badge.
And if he wasn't careful,
eventually someone would find out about his own dealings with Leroy.
[Leroy] My boy, my boy.
-It's been a while. -[Lee sighs] Yeah.
-[waitress] Whatcha having, honey? -Coffee. Ain't staying long.
You got a new toy?
[man] It's an English firearm.
It's really rare. It's got special bullets.
Untraceable.
[Lee] Untraceable.
[waitress] Sorry!
[Leroy] Word starts going around Sheriff's got his eye on the girls at Tecumseh.
That's gonna cost me my money.
Me losing money is gonna cost you your cut.
It didn't have anything to do with you.
It does now.
Bobo, you ever go and beat the shit outta someone I made my money off?
[Bobo] No.
Never crossed my mind, thinking about that.
Guy running against me is going door-to-door
telling folk I look the other way when it comes to Sandy.
Bobo, don't eat my scraps.
Give over the envelope.
There's debt you owe me.
What I'm gonna lose at the bar.
Horse shit.
You ain't losing nothing there.
[Leroy] Yeah?
And you know that 'cause you're a loaded diaper like everyone else who works for me
or because all of Meade knows you're dirty?
That's your weekly earnings 'til we're square.
Now, get the fuck out of my diner. [sighs]
[narrator] Bodecker knew that Leroy and his errand boy Bobo
would kill him soon enough if he made any more trouble.
He had an election to think about
and couldn't afford any liabilities.
[Leroy] My bar is off limits and so is your whore sister, you understand?
[man] Thanks for stopping.
-[Sandy] What's your name, sweetie? -Private Gary Matthew Bryson.
[Sandy] That's a nice name.
[Carl] You sound like you're at roll call. Relax, boy.
[Sandy] Which of them you go by?
Gary. That was my dad's name, so at home, I'm Gary Matthew.
[Sandy] Matthew? That's from the Bible, ain't it, Carl?
[Carl] Everything's from the Bible, honey.
Hell, Ol' Matthew, he's one of the Apostles.
You probably knew your name came out of the Bible, didn't you?
[Gary] We didn't go to church much when I was a kid.
But you've been baptized, right?
[Gary] Of course.
We ain't heathens.
I just don't know much about the Bible is all.
Good.
Lord knows where a person who ain't saved might end up.
Hm... Right now it looks like Vietnam.
[Sandy] It's beautiful, isn't it? All them trees just going up, up, up.
That's a good picture.
[Gary] Sure is.
You're a nice boy, Gary.
[Gary] Thanks for inviting me to lunch.
What do you say we eat, huh?
[Sandy] What do you want, Gary?
[Gary] Uh, bologna's good.
Bologna? You want cheese?
Yes, please.
Okay.
-[Gary] Thank you. -[Sandy chuckles]
Here you go, hon.
[Sandy] Gary?
Oh, no, thank you.
You don't drink?
I don't hold it very well.
Usually gets me in trouble.
Well, come on.
You mean to tell me you're not gonna have a drink with a pretty little thing like her?
[Carl] Yeah.
Whoo! That'll wake you up.
-[Gary] Here. -No, you go on and take another one.
-[Gary] Cheers. -[Carl] Cheers.
I got an idea.
Seeing as we might not see one another again...
we oughta record this for posterity.
-[Gary] You mean a picture? -[Carl] Damn right, I mean a picture.
-Sure, I'm game. -That's the spirit.
[Carl] I'll tell you what, Private. Why don't you just...
lie down on that blanket there on your side.
[Gary] Like that?
Like that.
Now, take that bottle and hold it
like you got it on you all the time.
[Gary] How's that?
-You're snoozing through Ferlin. -I don't like this gospel shit.
You know, we did him a favor.
He was just gonna get shot up and killed in Vietnam anyways.
God dammit.
-He wasn't nothing but another model. -I told you I don't like this anymore.
Ain't it fair if I hate the way some of 'em cry?
Not that you'd appreciate it,
but tears make for a good photograph.
[narrator] What Sandy didn't understand
was that to his way of thinking,
this was the one true religion.
Only in the presence of death
could he feel the presence of something like God.
[Gary] No, no, no!
[sobbing] Please! Please! Please!
[Carl] Don't you-- Don't you touch that fuckin' camera there, son.
[narrator] The sick fuck.
How about we check into a motel?
Get a couple of steaks, and relax for a day or two.
How does that sound?
[Sandy] Private Gary Matthew Bryson won't be reporting to Fort Eustis.
But he ain't a coward, he went and got himself killed.
Buried by the Mechums River in West Virginia.
Chopped up pretty bad in a suitcase.
No, I won't speak to nobody else.
[Preston] I've heard of cases in my reading
about sin
where someone got so sick...
over some sin they felt
they had committed that was so terrible
that they...
started imagining things.
Back, I read a story about...
people.
Poor people.
Barely able to write...
thinking they're...
the president
or...
or a Hollywood celebrity
like Ava Gardner.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
The thing is, that's the part of it.
The book says...
it's not, not understanding.
See, think about it.
How...
could I be
the daddy...
when all we done is spend time with the Lord?
[Arvin] Late night?
[Earskell] Played cards over at Elder Stubbs's garage again.
You win this time?
No, not really.
Saw Fred Dinwoodie over there.
He said his boy is just about healed up.
I still think you could have held back a little bit.
Well, he ain't bothered Lenora since.
Him or his candy-ass buddies.
I gotta go check in on her. She ain't been feeling too good.
You keep an eye on her for me while we're at church.
[narrator] Lenora had stopped asking Arvin to join her at Helen's grave.
He didn't mind much.
His mind would always drift back to Willard and the prayer log and his poor dog Jack.
and the prayer log and his poor dog Jack.
Besides, he'd gotten a job working on the road crew
and was busy making some money.
[inhales] I never missed church before.
I'm so ashamed.
You ain't got nothing to be ashamed of.
I'm sure the Lord will forgive you for missing one Sunday.
Ol' Jesus probably had his fair share of bad mornings.
[whispers] I love you, Arvin.
How's about we, uh... [sniffles]
go see your mama's grave when you're better?
Sound all right?
[Preston] The good book...
is filledwith good men
is filledwith good men and women
suffering delusions.
Eve in the garden.
Noah...
naked, drunk.
Bringing shame upon his family.
The idol the Jews bowed before in the desert.
And even the Lord Jesus himself was presented with delusions in the desert
that only through his faith...
and his strength...
-overcame. -[man 1] Mm-hmm.
[man 2] Praise Jesus.
The Lord's delusion in the desert was a game...
of the so-called "Devil."
And what the Lord experienced...
was a delusion that would've kept him from saving us!
But he did not fall for it!
It is our delusions
that lead us to sin.
Striking a mother or a wife for something that you thought they said.
Neglecting work or Sunday service, for that matter.
[man] Right. You said it.
Some girl...
gets a feeling for a fella and lets him have her holy gift.
Delusions!
Blaspheming the Lord in your mind and in your heart
for some wrong done to you by another person.
[man] That's true.
You're saying you don't...
remember all the things we did in your car?
I'm saying you must be crazy.
Coming in the Lord's house and talking all this trash.
Look, my advice to you, girl...
is you figure some way to get rid of it.
'Cause otherwise...
it's gonna be you, a whore mother,
and her little bastard child running around,
living in that poor old woman's house who raised you.
If nothing else, think of her.
She'll die from the shame of it all.
Come on.
Come on.
[narrator] Lenora suddenly knew she was making a mistake.
Grandma wouldn't be ashamed
and she and her baby would be okay.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
No! No! No!
[yells] Grandma!
Grandma!
No, no, no!
Grandma!
Grandma! [grunts]
[narrator] No one would know she wasn't a suicide
and that in the end, she was all right with her maker.
Oh, Lord.
There's just some things we can't understand.
But you take her into your arms.
Uh, ain't somebody...
saying prayers or...
[man 1] Need to have a word with you, Arvin.
-[man 2] All right, see ya, buddy. -[man 3] Yep.
See ya tomorrow.
[Arvin] About what?
[man 1] It's, uh...
It's about Lenora.
What about her?
I came by here instead of home so nothing's...
put on your grandmother.
"Put on"? What do you mean?
Well...
ol' Dudley, in the Coroner's...
I ain't never heard of no Dudley.
Well, he's a drunk... but he ain't no liar.
Did you know Lenora was carrying a baby?
That's bullshit.
That son of a bitch is lying.
I tell ya...
Dudley ain't a liar.
He came to me privately so as your family knew.
I felt he was right.
Now, I might've put my foot in something. It...
wasn't my intentions.
You know that preacher ain't said no words for her.
Not for people that kill themselves.
[sighs] Uncle...
[narrator] Arvin wanted so much to be able to tell them goodbye,
but they would be better off not knowing anything if the law came looking for him.
You have to be good to Grandma.
You know that she ain't hardly been out of her bed since the funeral?
Yeah.
Grandma needs you.
All right?
[Arvin] Dear Grandma...
I'm writing to you because I cannot say goodbye to your face.
I love you and I will always remember the things that you have done for me.
What I'm about to do, I do because I have to,
not because I want to.
Please do not try and find me.
Love, your grandson, Arvin.
[quietly] Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Preacher?
Got time for a sinner?
I've been doing wrong and I wanna get right by the Lord.
Well, that's what I'm here for.
I've done...
lustful acts.
Yeah.
That could be a big problem.
Especially for the young people.
Go on, tell me about it.
I got me a pretty wife at home.
One that'll do pretty much anything I ask.
But I treat her real bad.
Well, when you say anything,
what do you mean?
Just what I said.
Sometimes she'll be going down on me with...
well, you know, her mouth.
Heck, I get so excited I start forcing it.
She ever puke on you?
They got a little trigger, back there in their throat.
Yeah, well, that ain't my problem.
Well, what's the problem then, son?
This guy I work with  has got himself a daughter.
Real young thing, just started high school.
One day I got this girl in my truck and I drove her out into the sticks and I...
had my way with her.
Did she put up a fight?
No.
But, you see, the problem is, is...
once I'd had a taste, I just couldn't get enough.
I kept taking that girl there any chance I got.
So I'd strip her clothes off.
But I'd make her pray before we got started.
Why don't you take that hat off, boy.
Sometimes I'd even... keep her panties.
Now, I'd just...
sniff 'em as she rode off on her bike.
And then I'd go home to that whore of a wife of mine
and make her bake me a cake like I was celebrating.
-What in the hell is this? -[gun cocks]
You've been spying on me, boy?
I've been watching your every move for the last couple weeks.
You can't get enough of that Reaster girl, can you?
[inhales] Is that how you did my Lenora too?
So...
Mrs. Russell's boy?
All right.
Don't do anything you'll regret, son.
Why don't you put the gun down and...
we can talk all about it.
Go ahead and talk.
It wasn't my fault.
And Lenora...
was just like this... this Reaster girl.
She wouldn't let me be.
But I want you to know that I--
I pray for that girl's soul every night.
Do you pray for her baby's soul too?
Look, I didn't have... nothing to do with that.
She came to me... -saying she got that way from a boy-- -Don't fuckin' lie to me!
-saying she got that way from a boy-- -Don't fuckin' lie to me!
Lies-- [chuckles]
The lies--
The lies are hers.
She got it in her head that I was the father.
That I was gonna take care of everything.
God dammit, boy!
Listen to me!
I ain't gonna take the blame for no bastard child!
It would ruin me, man.
You can understand that, can't you?
Hell!
Listen to me, boy.
She was...
delusional.
She was crazy.
You see?
No, she was just lonely.
No, man.
Please, God!
Please, God!
Fuck. [panting]
-Fuck! -[drops shell]
Shit.
Shit.
[narrator] He had to get away from this place or any he ever called home.
But in this moment, he felt a sudden force
pulling in back towards Knockemstiff.
No matter what else happened,
he had to try to set right those things about his father
that still ate at his heart.
Come on.
Fuck.
[Bobo] Morning, Lee.
[Lee] Heya, Bobo.
Sorry to come by so early.
I was on my way to work and...
I thought I might chew your ear.
Still thinking about that gun you showed me.
Uh... I'm gonna scramble some eggs. You want some?
Yeah.
I'll take coffee if you got any.
[Bobo] Coming up.
Leroy here?
He's upstairs.
Pistol's in the dining room.
Pretty nifty.
♪ Why can't I... ♪ It's a fine piece.
Wonder if you'd consider selling me it.
[Bobo] Well, I just got it.
But everything's got a price, I guess.
You know, one thing I never can get is the...
scoops and water.
Is it more water to scoops
or more scoops to water?
[Leroy] "Bobo, go there do this."
He goes there, does it.
He's simple. [chuckles]
You too.
[Sandy] Carl?
I see him.
Carl?
-We don't even know where he's going. -Carl?
-Just-- -God dammit, Carl.
He's going to Ohio.
No one from home. That's your rule.
Let's just see where he's going, Sandy.
Morning.
Where you headed?
Meade, Ohio. You heard of it?
The paper-mill town, right?
Yeah, that's right.
We're passing right through it.
[Carl] What you going to Meade for?
-Just visiting. -[Sandy] Got family there?
No, I used to live there a long time ago.
[Carl] Well, probably ain't changed much. Little towns never do.
[Arvin sighs] Where is it y'all live?
[Carl] In Chesterfield.
We're headed up to Chicago, Illinois.
We like picking up strangers along the way, don't we?
Meet new people, don't we, hon?
Sure do.
[Carl] Oh, shit.
My old billy don't work like it used to.
I'm gonna have to... [sighs]
pull over and take a leak somewhere here.
[Carl] Is that all right by you?
Sure.
There should be a road somewhere up here on the right.
-Here? -[Carl] No, a little further.
Little further. Slow down. Turn in right here.
This is good.
[Carl] Right here.
Yeah, this'll work.
I won't be long.
Oh, shoot.
[Carl] Damn. That's gonna be one fine sunset.
You have to be patient with me while I get a few shots off.
Hon, give me the key.
Don't you worry none. We've got some hooch in the back and...
Well, Sandy's good company.
[narrator] The thought of killing Carl and taking off with the boy in the backseat
suddenly crossed Sandy's mind.
He was young, but that didn't mean she couldn't make it work.
Tell you what, son. Why don't you ste--
[Sandy gasps] Shit!
[Sandy] No! Calm down, please!
I don't wanna shoot you! Put the gun down!
-I don't want to shoot. -I'm so sorry!
[Sandy] Carl, you want sandals or heels?
Heels.
[narrator] Serial murderers aren't the most trusting kind.
Carl brought the additional quality of being maniacally paranoid.
Sandy's behavior before they left home made him uneasy,
and Carl thought it'd be better if he was the only one with a loaded weapon.
Poor Sandy never stood a chance.
Her gun was loaded with blanks.
[narrator] Jim Lacey.
New Burlington, Indiana.
Carl never photographed a more symmetrical face.
This photo really meant something to him.
Jim had been their first.
[radio] Sheriff Bodecker, this is Deputy Howser. Come in. Over.
Sheriff, you there? A farmer called in a double homicide off the 506. I need you here.
A farmer called in a double homicide off the 506. I need you here.
I'm sorry, Lee. This is fucked up.
What do you mean?
It's your sister and her husband.
[man] Carl was shot twice.
Sandy once.
It looks like it was a nine millimeter.
Sandy got one shot off but...
her gun was loaded with blanks.
-[whispers] Jesus Christ. -[man] Lee?
Give me a couple minutes here alone with her.
[narrator] She'd always been sort of fucked up,
but Lee blamed Carl for the way she'd gone downhill.
Regardless of all that, she was still his baby sister.
But the sheriff couldn't help but think of his own situation for a moment.
He thought about that photo he found of her
and worried about what else people might find if he didn't get to it first.
Reverend Roy Laferty,
Durham, North Carolina.
Though the poor fucker had been completely worthless as a model,
Carl was insistent on keeping a record
of both his successes and his failures.
[man] Howdy.
You look like you've been traveling.
-Yeah. -Where you headed?
There used to be a house and a barn up on the hill over there.
Some lawyer owned it. You know it?
Sure I do.
Up in the Mitchell Flats.
Still there?
Well, I'll be damned.
You're that Russell boy, ain't you?
I just thought, seeing as I was this way, I'd stop by and see the old place again.
[sighs] Son, I hate to tell you this, but that place burned some years ago.
They think some kids did it.
Wasn't nobody ever living there since you and your folks.
Well, heck, I come all this way, I may as well walk up there anyways.
Sure, just cut across Clarence's pasture.
He won't say nothing.
I never did thank you for the night my dad died.
You were awful kind of me, and I just want you to know that I ain't never forgot it.
You had that pie smeared all across your face.
Damn Bodecker thought it was blood. Remember that?
Yeah, I remember everything about that night.
He ain't the lawman that I expected.
Shame about his sister though.
Why? What happened?
Well, his sister and her husband were found dead. Not far from Meade.
You come back to see me.
We'll sit out and drink some beer.
I'll do that.
[man] Lee. Got a call from Sheriff Thompson in Lewisburg, West Virginia.
Wants you to call him back as soon as possible.
[Thompson] I had a man shot down here two days back.
He was a preacher.
And we're suspecting it's a boy that used to live up around your parts.
That right?
How'd he kill the man?
A couple shots.
Pistol. Probably a Luger that the boy's known to have.
-That's a nine millimeter, ain't it? -That's right.
What'd you say the boy's name was?
I didn't say, but it's Arvin Russell.
Both of his parents died up around there, as I understand it.
Father was a suicide, and he's been living down here
Father was a suicide, and he's been living down here with the grandmother and the uncle.
Listen, I don't think the boy's dangerous.
From what I'm hearing, this preacher might've deserved killing.
Is this boy driving?
Could be.
He owns an ol' busted up Chevy 3100, '54.
I don't know that it'd make it all the way up there.
At this point, he might be hitchhiking.
Dark hair, not bad looking. Quiet.
Who's gonna bury Jack?
I don't know.
I don't know who's gonna wanna touch that thing.
[sighs] Look, kid...
my daddy didn't do anything like what your daddy did up there,
but he did up and leave me, my mama, and my sister.
He just went off to the shoe factory one morning and never came back.
And there was nothing to do but forget his sorry ass.
Some people were born just so they could be buried.
[narrator] Arvin thought about the days leading up to his mother's death,
how Willard wanted so much for her to live.
His father would have done anything to save her.
Fuck the blood and stink, the heat and the insects.
Anything.
Arvin said to himself.
And suddenly he realized, standing in his father's church,
that he'd had no other choice,
that Willard had needed to go wherever Charlotte went.
Arvin Russell!
I know you're down there somewhere!
It's Sheriff Bodecker, son!
Got some questions to ask you!
Sorry about that!
Goddamn bird scared me.
I ain't here to hurt you!
And I know that you don't wanna hurt me!
Come on out so we can have us a talk!
[panting] Okay.
[Lee] I figured this might be where you'd come.
Remember that night you brought me up here?
That was an awful thing your daddy did.
God dammit, boy, don't-- don't fuck with me!
Put the gun down, Sheriff! I got one pointed right at you!
Can't do that, son!
Just set it on the ground and step away!
What?
Just set it on the ground and step away!
So you can kill me like you did my sister and that preacher down in West Virginia?!
I'm not a bad person, Sheriff.
That preacher weren't no good!
He hurt my sister so bad she killed herself, Sheriff!
I had no choice!
I hate to be the one to tell you this, Sheriff, but your sister...
and her husband, they weren't no good neither!
I got a snapshot in my pocket here of her hugging on some dead guy.
You let loose that gun and I'll show it to you!
I had no choice.
They were gonna kill me, I swear.
I begged her to put the gun down.
I'm sorry.
[narrator] Though it seemed to Arvin as if hours went by
while he listened to the Sheriff fight to stay alive,
it actually took the man only a few minutes to die.
Thank you, mister.
I didn't think anybody was gonna pick me up.
Looks like you had a rough day.
[Arvin] Yeah.
Uh, where you headed?
[Arvin] I ain't figured that out yet. Where you headed?
[man] Cincinnati.
-All right. -That okay for you?
[Arvin] Uh...
Yeah, I've been meaning to get up that way.
[reporter] ... to make known his final decision
to significantly increase the number of US troops deployed to south Vietnam.
He explained the reason for his actions in these historic words.
[Lyndon B. Johnson] We intend to convince the communists
that we cannot be defeated by force of arms
or by superior power.
They're not easily convinced.
[narrator] Arvin didn't want to fall asleep sitting next to a stranger,
and as he fought hard to stay awake,
his mind began taking him places.
He started to think maybe the law would recognize he had done good.
Maybe he'd be forgiven.
Maybe he'd even be able to see Grandma and Uncle Earskell again.
Or maybe that was too risky.
What happened?
[narrator] But still... maybe he'd meet a girl, start a family like his daddy did.
maybe he'd meet a girl, start a family like his daddy did.
As the thoughts came, he wasn't sure if he was going backwards or forwards.
He knew wherever this was,
it felt nicer than Knockemstiff.
No fighting or screaming or pain.
Then the thought of enlisting got into his brain.
And he wasn't sure if he was thinking about himself or Willard anymore.
He didn't want to end up in a war like his father.
But he was good at fighting.
Maybe that's where he belonged.
Grandma would tell him to pray on it, and he'd laugh at her.
But maybe she knew something he didn't.
