-[man 1] Welcome home! -[girls 1] Hi, Daddy!
[girl 2] Hi, Dad! Hi, Mom!
-Mom! -Hi!
Wait. Did you get taller?
-Yes, I did. -Wow.
So good. Okay. Oh, here it is.
-Let's get your trunk. -Yes.
I double-parked the car and they're already mad at me.
-What car? -Oh, we bought a car.
-We bought a car? -Yeah!
-What for? -I'll explain later.
It's that big blue one there. In the middle of the road.
-[man 2] Are you kidding me? -Sorry!
There's my girl!
Grandma!
-Oh! God, I missed you! -Me too!
You can't stop in the middle of the street. Let's go!
Sorry. Promise, two more seconds.
-Welcome-home gift. -Oh, you made this?
From scratch. It's cashmere. I did everything but shave the goat.
-Margaret! Can you just... -Let's go.
-So sorry. Yeah, get the bottom there. -Okay. You got it.
Here we go. Okay.
-Right on, girls. -Okay. Here we go.
-Oh, God. -Heavy.
Watch out for the...
-Watch out for the bike. -Oh, God.
[Barbara] Here we go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. I would've done it.
[Barbara] Oh, hi!
I would've done it. Please, please.
-Oh, my God. Amazing. -We got it.
-Dad! -Hello! Oh, my goodness!
-I'm so glad to see you. -Me too!
Look at that! What happened?
-So how was camp? -It was amazing.
-So you were in a play? -Yep!
Oh, my God. That's incredible.
-What are those for? -Don't worry.
I want to hear more. What did you learn?
-What else did you do? -You're moving.
-What? -Really, Mom?
-Sylvia. You promised. -Oh, wow.
We're moving?
-Look... We were... -[Sylvia] She saw the boxes.
-She was putting it together. -I don't think she was.
-We're moving? -Okay.
Look, we wanted you to settle in before we sprung the news.
But your dad got his promotion.
[Herb] Yeah. Isn't that great?
[Barbara] And we found this great house.
-[Herb] Oh, the best house. -Where?
Well, that's the thing. We got really lucky.
New Jersey.
New Jersey? -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -[Herb groans]
I said I'd stay out of it.
We're leaving New York?
Barely leaving New York. It's just on the other side of the river.
But we're happy here. We don't need to move.
No, we don't need to move, but we want to move. Right?
I don't.
I'll have to leave all of my friends and change schools,
and I'll never see Grandma anymore.
That is not true.
Look, you're gonna keep all your friends here,
and you're gonna make more friends. And listen to this.
I'm not gonna work anymore.
Do you know what that means?
That means that I'm not gonna be gone all the time.
Running from class to class.
God. Do you know how bad I felt about that?
But you love teaching art.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do...
but this is our opportunity.
I'll be home now. I can be home with you every single day.
I'll get involved at your school, just like all your friends' moms.
And we'll have family dinners and I'll learn to cook.
I know it's a lot.
Can you just try to believe us?
Yeah.
I love you so much. Come here.
Come here. You too. And you, Sylvia.
-Sylvia. Come on. -Come on, Mom. Come on.
You know you want to.
-Faster. -Okay, okay, I'm coming, I'm coming.
-There we go. -Oh, my darling.
-I'm never gonna see you again. -Oh, Jesus.
So dramatic all the time.
What are you taking her over there with the schmucks and the condos
-on the other side of the Hudson? -Not in a condo.
And those Mafia diners, where they shoot each other.
Cannolis...
God...
God?
Are you there, God?
It's me... Margaret Simon.
I just wanted...
Well, first, I've heard a lot of great things about you.
I don't want to move.
I've never lived anywhere but the city, and...
I don't want to do this.
Please, I'm begging you.
Just please, just stop this move from happening.
If you can't do that...
just please don't let New Jersey be too horrible.
-You're gonna have to hurry up, all right? -Okay, Dad!
-I think it's really pretty. -Take it, it's a quarter.
Okay, you. You need some light.
[sniffs] Oh, God.
They smell bad?
Oh, they don't smell good, honey.
You're gonna be there very soon. Believe me.
I'll get it.
I already know your name's Margaret and you're in 6th grade.
The real estate agent sent out, like, a tiny flyer about you to the whole neighborhood. It was this big and it had your picture.
to the whole neighborhood. It was this big and it had your picture.
Oh, okay.
I'm Nancy. I'm in 6th grade too.
Do you want to come over to my house and run under the sprinklers with me?
Oh. I don't know.
You don't know?
Oh, no, no, no. I just mean I'll have to ask.
Um, just a second.
-Mom? -Yeah?
There's a girl who asked if I could go under the sprinklers with her.
There's a girl who asked if I could go under the sprinklers with her. Oh, that's great. Yeah.
I need my bathing suit.
Good luck finding it in here.
That's all right. She can borrow one of mine.
Oh, hello.
Nancy Wheeler. I live in the bigger house up the street.
Come on, let's go.
Whose class are you in at Delano?
The letter said "Room 18."
I'm in Room 18 too!
We were supposed to have Miss Phipps, but she ran off with some guy to California, so we're getting a new teacher now.
to California, so we're getting a new teacher now.
Come on. Room's upstairs.
Voilà.
My bathing suit's over here.
-Here. It's clean. -Thanks.
-Where should I change? -What's wrong with here?
Nothing. I don't mind if you don't mind.
[scoffs] Why would I mind?
You're still flat.
-Um... -Well, I'm already growing. See? I'm gonna have a pretty big chest.
You know, coming from New York, I thought you'd be a lot more grown-up.
Have you ever kissed a boy?
You mean, like, really kiss? Like, on the lips?
Yeah. Have you?
Not exactly.
Neither have I, but I practice a lot. You want to see?
What?
-Sorry. -You have to practice,
or else you won't be a good kisser.
Ready to go?
Sure.
Follow the leader.
Yeah, watch me.
-I'm a supermodel. -Okay.
-Evan, you stupid idiot! -I'm sorry.
You're a great model, by the way.
-Who are they? -My dumb brother and his stupid friend.
-Mom! -That was uncalled for. Who are you?
Margaret. We moved in down the street.
Oh, so you're the new people?
Ask your dad if he wants me to cut the lawn. Five bucks. I trim too.
[Mrs. Wheeler] Evan! Get over here right now!
-[sighs] I got to go. -Dude...
Got to get us more birdseed.
Yeah.
My name's Moose. Moose Freed. I live down the street too.
Yeah, but don't forget to ask your dad about the lawn thingy.
Yeah. [giggles] I won't.
Oh, now I got to go see Evan.
Sorry you got stuck with Moose.
Oh, that's okay.
Anyways, listen, Margaret.
I've decided I want you to join my secret club.
There's three of us and I'm letting in one more.
But you can't wear socks, or else the others might not want you.
See you later.
Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret, again.
It's the first day of school tomorrow.
I met this girl, Nancy. I don't really know if she liked me.
I mean, she just expected me to be different or something.
Anyway, well, it did get me thinking.
Maybe it is time for...
things to be happening around here?
Come in.
Look.
-Think about what I mentioned. -It was in with the bathroom stuff.
-I found this, if you need it. -Thanks, God.
-Thanks, Mom. -Mm-hm.
Oh, wow, look at you.
Are you ready for your first day? How you feeling?
It's gonna be great, right?
And if it's not great, first days don't count anyways.
-Right? -Exactly.
-All right. See you later. Bye! -Bye!
Did I not unpack your socks?
Uh, I don't want socks.
Why? You'll get blisters.
I just don't.
Okay.
-[lawn mower starts outside] -Oh. Oh, wait. Dad!
-Hey, hey, Dad! -Yeah?
-Hey. -Hey.
I forgot to ask you.
A boy named Moose asked if he can cut our lawn for five bucks.
Moose? Well, tell him thanks but no thanks.
I just got a new power mower and I'm excited for the grass to grow.
[chuckles] All right. Knock 'em dead today, all right, sweetie?
-Okay. -Bye.
I need to warn you one more time about the socks.
Come on, hurry up, we're gonna be late for class!
[gasps] Margaret's here.
Hello. Good, I thought you'd forget.
Guys, this is Margaret, the one I was telling you about.
This is Janie.
-Hi, nice to meet you. -Yeah, you too.
And this is Gretchen.
-So you're the fourth. -Yeah.
Well, you're lucky we saved you a seat.
Or else you'd be sitting next to Norman Fisher.
Ugh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, don't look.
Philip Leroy just walked in.
I was praying so hard he'd be in our class.
Who's Philip Leroy?
Take a guess.
Is that our teacher?
[gasps] Her? No.
That's Laura Danker. Stay away from her, okay?
My brother says that she goes behind the A&P with him and Moose,
and lets them feel her up.
Good morning, class. [chuckles]
First, let me introduce myself. I am Mr. Benedict.
And I'm your new 6th-grade teacher.
Please complete the following sentences
so we can get to know each other a little better, yeah?
Now, I'll begin, just to start things off for you guys.
I love that I'm finally getting to be a teacher for the first time.
I hate...
feeling self-conscious, trying not to feel self-conscious,
'cause then you only feel more self-conscious,
and then you're blabbing in front of a bunch of kids. Um...
I'm looking forward to the year with you all.
Okay, uh, your turn.
[whispering] Pass it on.
Yes. Okay.
Can any of you go in here?
No.
Back in the box.
Okay. All right. Enough.
Enough, enough, enough.
-Hello? -Guess who.
Oh. Sylvia, hi. Um...
-Margaret's not home yet. -It's 3:32.
Yeah?
You said she's out at 3:15 and the walk is ten minutes.
Yes, I did say that. But, well...
I'm sure she'll be walking through that door any minute now.
Well...
Okay. I guess I'll just wait.
Okay.
So how are you?
I am fine. I'm good. Yes.
-And how are you? -Oh, fine.
I read that when you don't have any loved ones around,
your life expectancy drops drastically, but, you know, I've had a good run.
You have. You really have.
Margaret is here. Just a second.
-It's Grandma. -Oh. Where's the Band-Aids?
-Grandma! -Honey!
How's New Jersey? Are you okay? You can tell me the truth.
You know, it's actually not that bad.
Well, that's great news! Wonderful news.
Anyway, I was thinking that you could come visit the weekend after next.
I'll get tickets to a show.
You can stay overnight, we'll have a little slumber party.
That could be fun, right?
Oh, I'd love that.
Oh, I knew you would. Great.
And I'll tell your mother it was your idea.
-Okay? -Okay.
-Bye. Bye. -Bye, sweetheart.
-Bye. [laughs] -Love you.
Hey, Mom, can I go to Nancy's?
Right now? But you just got home. I haven't even heard about your day yet.
-I know, but can I go? -Can I have one word?
-Is that a word? -Can I go?
-Yes, yes, okay, go. I love you. -Bye.
-Bye. Bye! -Bye!
[Nancy] Freddy was like, "Boom, boom, look at me!"
He's like, "Make up your mind!"
-She wants attention. -Obviously.
I know. With her "boobala jubilee."
-Hi! -We were talking about Laura Danker again.
Yeah. And how she got even bigger over the summer.
Yeah, she looked so grown-up.
You know she's worn a bra since 4th grade?
And I bet you a dollar she gets her period too.
[Gretchen] I know someone in the school does.
-How? -I always check the bins.
-You know those little bins in the stall? -Mm.
All right. Let's get down to business, huh?
-First of all... -Thanks.
...this secret club is a secret.
Nobody tells anybody what happens here, all right?
Duh.
Second, if you want to be in the club,
then you have to follow the rules.
What kind of rules?
Well, I don't know. I'm thinking of them.
Don't rush me.
Oh, I have one.
If you want to be in the club, then you have to wear a bra.
[Gretchen] I have one.
If you guys get your period, you have to tell us about it.
-Yes. -[Gretchen] Immediately.
Every detail. Especially how it feels.
-[Gretchen] Mm-hm. -[Janie] Ooh, mine is,
we can make a Boy Book and write down the names of the boys that we like.
What about you, Margaret? What's your rule?
Um... Yeah, with the Boy Books, we have to show them
Um... Yeah, with the Boy Books, we have to show them to each other at every meeting and we can't ever lie.
All right.
[Nancy] Let's get this party rolling. Whoo!
♪ Ooh, baby ♪
♪ Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry ♪
Okay, honey.
All right. Mmm.
See you tomorrow.
I want to get a bra.
You think you need one?
Oh, no. Oh, honey.
I'm so sorry. No, I just mean that, uh...
Bras are kind of a pain, so, you know, why start sooner than you need to?
But if you want one, we can get you one.
Well, yeah.
So you want one?
-Yes. I already said that. -Right. Okay.
Great. Well, all right. Well, then, we will do that.
-This week? -Yes. Good night.
Good night. Good night, my sweet. Okay.
So glad that's over with, God.
I'm sorry. Hold on, just a moment.
Are you here for the PTA meeting?
Yes. Hi, hi. I'm Barbara Simon.
Oh, Barbara! I'm Jan Wheeler. Nancy's mother.
-I met Margaret. -Oh. Oh.
We're just about to get started, so please come in.
-Have a seat. -Okay, thank you.
-All right. -Anywhere is fine?
-Here. Just right here. -Okay, okay.
Here we go.
Thank you all for coming.
Delano is nothing without its dedicated parents.
Let's dive right in and get started the way we do every year,
by forming our committees.
First up, we have the Campus Improvement Committee.
Any volunteers?
Okay. Ooh.
Wonderful.
Barbara, I got you. Okay.
Next, the Delano Social Committee.
Sure, yeah. Okay.
-Okay. -Great.
All right. The Fundraising Committee.
Good for you, Barbara.
This is gonna be great.
All right. Pencils down.
All right. Pencils down. Kindly pass your worksheets forward.
How'd you do, Margaret?
[Margaret] I think I did good.
All right, uh, before the bell, I want to share some news
All right, uh, before the bell, I want to share some news that I think will make you all very happy.
[chuckles] Now that you all are in the 6th grade,
you'll get to do a full year-long research project. -[students groan] -Yes.
Yes!
-[boy] The worst! -No.
Margaret, I would like to talk to you for a moment after class.
Uh-oh. What'd you do, Margaret?
-Hi. -Please have a seat.
So basically I'm just having little chats with each student in advance of your research projects,
with each student in advance of your research projects,
to answer any questions or perhaps guide you toward a topic of choice.
Oh. And I read your getting-to-know-you paper.
And I noticed under the "I hate" section, you wrote "religious holidays."
Which I found curious.
If you don't want to share, you don't have to, Margaret.
Oh, no. It's just...
I guess I just don't like those holidays because I don't celebrate any of them.
My dad is Jewish and my mom's Christian,
so instead of picking which religion I am, uh,
they just decided that I wouldn't have one and I can choose when I grow up.
And have you given that much thought?
Not really. My grandma wants me to be Jewish.
And your other grandparents want you to be Christian, I imagine.
I don't know. I've never met them before.
They live in Ohio.
So you've never met them at all?
-No. -Oh.
Well, if I may suggest it...
I feel like religion could be a very compelling research topic for you.
[Sylvia over phone] Tickets are tenth row, dead center, very hard to get.
-Tell her that. -I will.
-Is she excited? -She's excited.
Well, I mean, is she excited or is she just excited?
She's excited.
Okay, okay, okay, I'll let you go. I'm excited!
-Okay, bye. -Bye.
Hey.
-Hey. -What happened to the couch?
It's time to turn over a new leaf.
I was thinking maybe something modern?
I don't know. I have to think about it. How was school?
You're home a little later than usual, huh?
Yeah.
Hey. How come I've never met your mom or dad?
Well, what made you think about that?
Just wondering.
I mean, I know that we don't see them because they're so far away,
but why don't we even talk to them?
We just... We just don't.
It's, uh... It's... It's, um... It's such a long story.
What do you mean?
I mean I'll tell you another time.
Why can't you just tell me now?
[sighs] Just...
Look, I just...
So, um...
We don't see my parents because, um...
they don't want to.
What?
My mom and dad are very, very devout Christians,
and before you were born, when your dad and I first fell in love...
Um, they told me that it would be very hard for them to, uh, have a...
Sorry.
Jewish son-in-law.
They told me it would be very hard for them to have a Jewish son-in-law.
And that if I wanted to marry him, that was my business,
but I wouldn't be their daughter anymore.
But you are their daughter.
I guess, um, what I mean is that, um...
they just didn't want me in their life anymore.
So I'm not.
-[voice breaking] Mom. -It's okay. Oh, honey.
It was a long time ago.
I have you guys.
Okay, you know what? I took Dad to the station
so we could have the car 'cause we're supposed to go shopping, remember?
Remember? Bras?
Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret.
I can't believe this.
What kind of parents would do that?
And blame it on religion?
God, please take care of my mom.
She's a good person. -She's nice to everyone. -You're welcome.
Even when she doesn't need to be.
-Thank you. -Can't forget about you.
[Margaret] I don't know why this happened.
But please, somehow, make it all okay.
And here are the bras.
[Margaret] Also, I'm getting a bra today. I'd like something to put in it, please.
Excuse me.
Uh, we're looking for a bra for my daughter.
Well, we don't have many that small.
But come with me, dear, I'll measure you.
Arms up, dear.
Barely a 28. Not even a double-A.
Your best bet is gonna be to go
-with one of these Gro-Bras here. -It's okay.
So one day, when you do grow, it'll grow with you.
Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks, we'll just go try it on.
Yeah. Can I just...? I'll just... Yep.
Here we go.
[sighs] This is always the tough bit.
I can't even do this, to this day.
Okay. All right. Can I see?
-How's that feel? -I cannot wait to take it off.
Yeah. Welcome to womanhood.
Make sure you get the soap.
Oh, hello.
Hello.
Look at you. Working the land.
Heavy machinery, ouch.
Be better if I take my shirt off, or it's too much?
Not for me.
There it is, yeah.
You ever been kissed in the suburbs?
No, sir.
I'm Laura Danker. What's your name?
Goddamn it! [groans]
-Oh, my God. -Ooh. -Did you lose a finger? -Ooh.
It does say, "Stop the engine motor
before cleaning mower or unclogging the chute."
-Whose side are you on? -No, you turn off the motor before...
-I'm fine. -You have to turn the mower off, Dad.
[Nancy] Well, time for Boy Books, everyone.
Who wants to go first?
Like it matters. We all already know who everyone put down.
Philip Leroy!
[Nancy] He's so cute.
[Gretchen] It's been the same since 2nd grade.
-He looks better. -Really?
Yes. He must have gone to the beach or something.
-He doesn't different. -Who'd you put down, Margaret?
Yeah, I put him too.
All right, well, that was quick.
Now it's time to check for the bras.
-[bra strap snaps] -Gretchen has a bra.
-[bra strap snaps] -Janie has a bra.
-[bra strap snaps] -Margaret has a bra.
Now let's go around and tell our sizes.
Well, mine didn't say it had a size. It just said it was a Gro-Bra.
Yeah, I got that one too.
Oh, same here.
[Nancy] Well, not me.
I'm a 32, double-A.
If you want to get out of those small bras,
you're gonna have to do the same exercising technique I do.
-There's an exercise? -[Nancy] Of course there is.
You hold your arms out like this
and you say, "I must, I must, I must increase my bust.
I must, I must, I must increase my bust."
-Does that really work? -I'm living proof.
Now, come on, get up. Get up! Get up! Get up!
You'll see. Get up.
"I must, I must, I must increase my bust."
-[all] "I must, I must increase my bust." -"I must..."
Chin up!
[all] "We must, we must, we must increase our bust.
We must, we must, we must increase our bust."
[in high-pitched voice] "We must, -we must increase our bust." -[screaming]
Shut up! -You're so stupid! Shut up! -[Evan] I feel it working!
-You're so stupid! Shut up! -[Evan] I feel it working!
Mom!
[Barbara] Grandma said she'll pick you up right where you pull in.
-Yes. -I don't want you to talk
-to anybody on the bus. Especially men. -Right.
-You find a nice seat by yourself... -Okay, Dad.
...by the bus driver.
Excuse me, sir, this young lady, she's traveling by herself today.
Could you keep an eye on her?
-[driver] Sure, lady. -Mom.
Okay, goodbye. Goodbye.
-It's gonna be fun. Bye. -Bye!
-Okay. Have fun. -See ya.
Right there, right there!
-[Herb] Good. -[Barbara] There you go.
-See ya! -Independence is good, right?
Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret.
I'm a little nervous, actually, about being alone,
so can you just not let anything really horrible happen?
Oh, good. That makes me feel a little better.
You know, maybe I will do my school project on religion.
I think it's finally time for me to decide what to be, God.
You wouldn't mind, would you?
I'll tell you all about it.
And I promise I won't make any decisions without you first.

[Sylvia] Wait a minute. Okay. You should always
put your hand lotion on last thing at night.
And then some ladies put gloves on over that to sleep in.
-You know why? -No.
Okay. You have to promise not to tell anybody this, what I'm gonna tell you.
-Okay? Okay, swear? -Okay. I swear.
So I actually did this. I got really fabulous hand cream,
I bought these white gloves, -and put them on. -Oh!
All right. No, I did, I did. And so I'm lying there, like...
I must've been asleep, and I must've gone like this:
And I was like, "Who's in here?"
'Cause I couldn't feel my own hands.
I almost had a heart attack.
Oh, God. You are a fab... I had the best time tonight.
-It was amazing. -You are a great date, toots.
Oh, my gosh. You are.
[sighs] Lordy, Lordy.
Before I forget, if you hear, like, a:
Or a... It's not me.
Okay? You're just dreaming and you're dreaming. All right?
Okay. Sweet dreams.
Hey, Grandma?
Yeah, sugar.
Do you think maybe I could go to the temple with you sometime?
[gasps] You bet you can.
Really? Really?
Yeah.
We'll go in the morning. I got to find what to wear. Oh.
[man] Welcome.
My granddaughter is here with me today.
Shabbat Shalom.
My granddaughter. My granddaughter.
There's the rabbi. He's the best in the city.
Two hours, in and out, bing, bang, boom.
Welcome, dear friends.
Oh, it's starting.
Shabbat Shalom.
[congregation] Shabbat Shalom.
Shabbat Shalom means "hello," "goodbye," "peace and harmony," and other stuff.
[rabbi] ...in thanks to God this morning.
We open our prayer books and we turn to page 26.
[rabbi in English] ...agree to the terms of their covenant with God.
[congregation] Shabbat Shalom.
Oh, that was lovely.
Oh, sweetheart. Congratulations.
Mazel tov. [chuckles]
[Margaret] I don't know, God.
The people seem nice and I like the music,
but I guess I expected something else?
I don't know what, exactly. A feeling, maybe?
I can't believe that she took you to temple without even asking us.
I'm surprised it took so long.
I told you guys that it was my idea. I just wanted to try it out.
I'm gonna try church too, Mom, so don't freak out.
I don't care about church. I don't want you to go to church.
I don't think you should be bothering yourself with any of this stuff right now.
You said I can choose my own religion when I grow up.
Yeah, when you grow up. When you're an adult.
I'm almost 12.
-That's almost an adult. -Honey, no.
-Margaret. Honey. -[oven dings]
I shouldn't have laughed.
-It was funny. -I just...
I don't want her to go through any of it.
I don't either. But it might not be the worst thing.
Think about it.
What does that mean?
Well...
she'll go to a couple of endless services,
and then she'll realize how lucky she was we never made her go.
Know what got me off going to temple?
-What? -Going to temple.
Don't understand a word they're saying. And you sit there for a long time.
Oh, honey.
-Oh. -What? I am so sorry. I am...
-What? -I swear I'm gonna buy the furniture.
This is all I need.
Look at it. And look...
Oh, God!
Find me a couch that does this. -[laughing] -Okay?
You know how ugly the ceiling in our gymnasium is?
-It is. -Yes, it is.
We'll have it refinished, paint it completely black,
and then we'll cut out little stars...
and recreate the night sky.
-Oh, that's sweet. -How lovely.
So how many stars would we need?
I was thinking five or ten thousand.
It shouldn't take us long. I've got some scissors right here.
Okay. [laughs]
-[country music playing] -Promenade right.
Now single file.
And that's it. Yeah!
-[bell rings] -Great. It's the effort that counts. Good evening.
-I'm so glad this is done. -Yeah, that sucked.
-It took forever. -Norman's horrible.
[whispering] Guys. Gretchen got the book.
-What book? -[Nancy] You know...
My dad's anatomy book that I told you about?
It looks like a thumb.
-Oh. -It's so saggy.
It's a wobbly blob.
My brother's looks like that.
-Ew. -How do you know?
He walks around naked. I see it. It's not a pleasant sight.
I never want to see anyone naked or have anyone see me naked.
It's just gross.
Come on. What about when you get married?
Especially then.
Janie...
Once you grow a little, you'll want the whole world to see you.
Just like the girls in Playboy.
What girls in Playboy?
-You've never seen Playboy? -Playboy?
Where would I see it?
My dad gets Playboy.
Wait. So you have a copy here, in this house?
-Well, I don't know where it is. -Of course you know where it is.
Go on.
-I don't know. -[Nancy] Margaret, come on.
-Go get it. -Go get it, Margaret.
[Julia Child] You don't wanna overcook.
You don't wanna start cooking the bouillabaisse until just the last minute, 'cause you've got your...
Look how round they are.
Mine just look like little wizard hats.
"Hillary Brite is a 19-year-old who loves water-skiing, horses,
and going out to the mall for an Orange Julius."
Do you think any of us will look like that when we're 19?
[all] "We must, we must, we must increase our bust!
We must, we must, we must increase our bust!"

Hey, what are you doing? Are those Christmas cards?
New Year's cards. I'm trying to get on top of it this year.
-Yeah. -Oh, there's the mailman.
You've got your boots on? Can you just run those out to him?
-Thank you, honey. -Of course.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
Norman Fisher?
[Barbara] So who's Norman Fisher?
This weird kid in my class.
I don't even know why he invited me. I barely know him. -[telephone ringing] -Mm.
Hello?
Did you get invited to stupid Norman Fisher's birthday party?
Yeah. You did too?
Everyone did. The whole class. Janie, Gretchen, everyone.
Even Philip Leroy.
-Even Laura Danker? -I said, everybody.
Anyways, my mom talked to Norman's mom,
and I guess it's a big-deal dinner party.
We have to look extremely nice.
Ready? Lean on back.
No. No, no, no.
Where are my shoes?
Oh, my God! ♪ Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ooh ♪
Mom!
[Janie's mother] There we go.
This is gonna look so pre-- Stop moving!
-We are done. -Yes!
Okay, we're done. Come on. Mom.
Perfect. One more for your bubbe.
-Okay, let's go. Mom, no! -Okay. Wait. One more time. Please.
I'm gonna get these printed.
-It's weird. -Just push them...
Lick them with your fingers, stick it back. -[horn honks] -You got to go.
Bye! Thank you, Jan.
[Gretchen] My God, I am so excited for all of us to do this.
All right, I'll just...
-Just, just... -Okay.
I'll just... Yeah, okay. Have fun.
I can do it with this thing.
He's hilarious.
-How come she never talks to anybody? -I don't know.
'Cause she's too busy doing other stuff, that's why.
Now, if everybody's had enough to eat, we can start the games.
The games?
I'll spin first.
Okay. Now it's Janie's turn to spin.
-This is a great party. -Do we have to play this game?
Well, then, let's play a different game, huh?
I have one. It's called "two minutes in the closet."
What's that?
Well, we all get a number,
and then somebody will call out, like, number six,
and then those two will go into the closet and, you know...
Number three.
Who's number three?
Somebody's got to be number three.
Go ahead. Into the bathroom.
Somebody get Freddy a step stool.
-What do you think they're doing? -Shh!
I'm sorry.
You're next.
I pick number...
12.
What?
You're 12?
Nice.
Sorry.
Margaret, turn around.
So...
Hi.
Hey.
So...
[Nancy] So the kiss was really good?
They were pretty good kisses. Yeah.
Kisses? He kissed you more than once?
Like, how many times?
About five, I think.
I don't know. I think I lost count.
[Margaret] I know I shouldn't be enjoying this, God, but it's just too good.
Sorry, sorry, I'm gonna focus.
The Book of Isaiah, chapter nine, verses six and seven says:
"For unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given,
and he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father..."
[Margaret] If only you could give me a hint, God.
Of the greatness of His peace...
I'm more confused than ever. Which religion should I be?
Sometimes, I just wish I'd been born one way or the other.
Hi, there. This is Barbara calling, from Delano Elementary School.
And we're just looking for, uh, donations.
Sorry.
Oh, God. I didn't realize it was dinner.
Okay. Bye-bye.
[softly] Hi.
Don't go, don't go, don't go.
I can't believe you're still there. Okay.
Okay.
No.
Jan.
I just popped by to pick up your stars.
Yes. Um...
Uh... I've been cleaning. -Ah. -Come on in. Um...
I'll just, uh, get the stars.
Um, they're almost, uh, ready. Uh...
You know, I ordered furniture,
-and, um, they still haven't sent it. -Oh, my gosh.
So crazy. Okay, stars. Stars. Stars. Stars.
Thank you.
Oh, and don't say anything, but Deb's stars are a little lopsided. Oh.
You know, yours are so good.
Thank you.
You think you could do her allotment too?
Just between the two of us?
-[stammering] Sure... Yes. -Ah.
Thank you. You are such a doll.
Well, I better get going. There's lots to do still.
-I'll get the door there. Okay. -Thank you.
-Okay, bye. Thank you for these. -Bye, Jan. Sure, anytime.
Hello, girls.
I'm Mrs. Webster. And I am here to speak to you today
about your changing bodies.
Told you this was the big sex movie.
Some of you may have already begun to experience these changes.
While others of you still haven't experienced
a single change at all.
We're going to watch a short film to learn a little bit more.
[female narrator] All girls are unique. But sometime between the ages of 9 and 16,
one very special thing happens to every girl:
Menstruation.
Once a month, a velvety lining of blood and tissue
forms in her uterus to make a warm, nutritious place for a baby to grow.
If a baby is not conceived, the lining is not needed.
And so the blood is released through the vagina.
That's menstruation.
Who do you think will get it first?
Who do you think will get it last?
I honestly don't know what's taking me so long to get this dumb furniture.
I guess I just want our house to look like
one of those nice little houses nice little families have.
Do you like these egg chairs?
When did you get your period?
-Um... I... -Just tell me how old you were.
I think I was 14?
That late?
That's not late, actually. I mean, I had a cousin who was 16.
Sixteen? Oh, my God.
I-- I-- I'd die if I didn't get it before I was 16.
Honey, you will get it exactly when you're supposed to get it.
Don't worry about it.
[Nancy] My mom got me Radio City tickets since I got all straight A's.
Um, does anybody want to come?
Only bad thing is, is my brother and Moose are coming.
-Oh, I'll go. -Okay.
I got it.
Got what?
My period.
I just don't really understand how you got it first,
when I have way more than you.
-Well, that doesn't mean anything. -Yes, it does, Gretchen.
Tell us how it happened.
Start from the very beginning.
Well, I was sitting there at dinner,
eating my meatloaf,
and I felt something coming out of me.
So I went to the bathroom,
pulled down my pants, and that's when I saw the blood.
So I called my mom
and I showed her.
And she got some "sanitary napkins," as she calls them.
I put one on and...
Well, that's the whole thing.
That's the whole thing? Just that?
-I told you everything. -No.
There has to be something more.
My sister said that it kinda has a smell.
But I haven't noticed that yet.
A smell? Like what?
She said it kinda smells like the monkey bars.
The monkey bars? -Yeah. -[Nancy] Ugh.
I used to love the monkey bars.
But do you feel older now? Like, more mature?
Oh, yeah.
I don't know how to explain it and you won't understand it till you get it,
but I feel like everything's changed.
Are you there, God?
I've never been so jealous my entire life, and I hate myself for being jealous.
Just please, please just let me grow and let me get my period.
Let me just be normal and regular like everybody else.
Just please, please, please, please, please, please, please!
Amen.
I don't know if I want to do this.
It's fine. It's just so that we're ready.
Just in case.
Come on.
Okay.
[woman] Pharmacy, how can I help you?
Next in line, please.
Please, God, let it be a lady.
Please.
Thank you.
-Hey there. -Hey.
-No. -Let's just put them back.
No, come on. Come on.
-Oh, my God! -Oh!
The Tic Tacs!
-Why the Tic Tacs? -I don't know.
-Everything worked out. -Oh, man.
Uh, come in.
-Hey. -Hey.
Uh, you've got a postcard.
-Oh. Thanks. -Who's in D.C.?
Uh, Nancy. Uh, they went for President's Day.
-Oh. -Yeah.
-Okay. You want the door closed? -Yeah. Sure.
"I got it"?
Oh, come on!
Hello? Simon residence. Sylvia speaking.
Grandma?
Margaret? What's wrong?
I just really miss you.
Oh, honey.
Me too.
I'll be back next week to see the Rockettes,
and maybe could I come down and stay the night like we did last time?
Oh, sweetheart.
I'd love to, I'd love... But I...
Well...
I'm gonna be in Florida then.
I heard about this hotel,
and there's a lot of people my age there and, uh...
Um... Okay.
Wait a minute. Wait. Um...
What if you fly down to Florida and spend a few days with me?
-Isn't your spring break soon? -Yeah. The end of April.
Perfect! I'll still be there.
I'll ask Mom and Dad.
Oh, great!
That's my girl. Bye, darling.
[Nancy] Come on, come on! Front-row tickets!
-Front-row tickets, remember? -I'm coming! Yes, coming!
I'm so excited.
Hi.
-Hi. -Hey.
Excuse me.
Okay.
Thank you.
[Evan] I can get used to this.
What are you gonna get?
Sorry. Lefty.
Oh, no, it's okay.
Do you know if the waiter's anywhere?
You can have mine. I didn't drink any out of it.
Thanks.
Hey.
Do you know something I've always liked about you?
-No? -Come with me.
I got to go to the bathroom.
We'll be right back. Don't touch my food.
You know, I've had to go since we got here
and then I drank three 7 Up's or something.
Oh, no.
-Oh, no. -What?
Oh, please. Oh, no.
Nancy?
Oh, no.
Nancy, what's wrong?
Go get my mom, Margaret.
-What's going on? -Go get my mom.
-Please, quick. -Let me in.
-Please, please just go get my mom! -Okay, okay, I'll be right back.
Mrs. Wheeler, Nancy's crying. -She needs you. -Oh.
All right.
Nancy?
-Nancy? -Oh, Mom, please help me.
-Please help me. Please. -The door's locked, Nancy.
I can't get in. Unlock it.
-I can't open it, I can't. -Yes, you can, Nancy.
Unlock this door. [knocking on door] Come on.
Let me in.
What's going on?
All right, all right, calm down.
Calm down, I can't help you.
Hm? Hey, look at me. Calm down.
I can't help you if you don't stop crying and talk to me.
Hey. What is it?
All right. Um...
Here. We'll just, uh...
Margaret?
Margaret.
Would you get Nancy a pad, please,
from the dispenser on the wall?
She got her period, sweetie.
Does she always act like that?
Well, it's her first time. She's just a little scared.
Thank you, sweetie.
All right. Yeah?
All right.
Well, you girls wash up. I'm gonna go tell the others not to worry.
Not too long, now. Okay?
Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret.
I don't even know what to say.
I'm going to Florida?
-Happy birthday. -Mom. Thank you so much.
Hey!
-Happy birthday. -Thank you.
Why do we have different seats?
He said we're in groups to study different countries.
Oh. Hey.
Hey. Happy birthday.
-Thanks. -Oh, I got you something.
It's a pinch to grow an inch.
And you know where you need that inch. Hey.
Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret.
I hate Philip Leroy. I hate him.
I hate Laura Danker too! With her big boobs.
"Ooh, look at me, everybody, I'm wearing a sweater."
I hate Nancy. That liar!
And Norman Fisher, the way that he reads with his stupid lips flapping everywhere!
Please. Please, just hurry up and get me to Florida!
Philip and Norman should be here. They make us do all the work.
What time is your mom picking you up?
Not till later. I have to go to St. Thomas for confession first.
Confession?
It's something you have to do when you're Catholic.
What do you confess?
Things.
What kinds of things?
Never mind.
You're just copying straight out of the World Book.
It's four words.
"Germany invaded Belgium when."
So you're still cheating. Mr. Benedict will know if you're cheating.
I'm not cheating! Jeez! [woman] Shh!
Quit acting like you know everything and you're so great.
This has nothing to do with being great.
I know all about the stuff that you do.
What's that supposed to mean?
I heard about you and Moose Freed.
What about me and Moose Freed?
How you and Evan and Moose go behind the A&P.
And why would I do that?
I don't know why you do it. But I know why they do it.
So they can feel you up or something and you let them.
-You're a liar. You're lying! -I'm not lying.
You're just like Nancy.
All you do is pick on people and make up stories.
You think I don't know about you and your friends?
Laura!
Wait. Please! Laura!
-Wait up. Please! -You think I don't know
that all of you make fun of me like it's a game?
-It's not me. -You think I want to be
the biggest kid in the class?
How would you feel if you had to wear a bra in 4th grade
and everybody called you names just because of how you looked?
I don't know.
Hey, wait. I really am sorry.
Laura?
Laura.
[Margaret] I'm the worst person who ever lived, God.
I picked on Laura Danker just because I felt mean.
I don't want to be like Nancy.
I don't even know if I want to be friends with her anymore.
I've been looking for you, God.
I looked for you in temple...
I looked for you in church...
I didn't feel you at all.
Why? Why, God?
Why do I only feel you when I'm alone?
Yes, my child.
Do you have something you'd like to confess?
I did something really awful.
And...
I'm really sorry.
[Herb] "Dear Barbara...
your letter felt like an answer to prayer.
Your father and I have been thinking about you a lot.
We're getting older and suddenly, more than anything,
we'd like to see our only daughter
and finally get to know our granddaughter, Margaret Ann.
We're flying east next week, and we sincerely hope you'll let us visit.
Love, your mother, Mary Hutchins."
So you sent them a card?
I don't know why.
Do you remember what it was like when they just cast you out?
Yes.
Do you?
'Cause I remember.
I know. And how...
How they treated you was just...
-I know. -How they treated me...
They think you're going to hell because you married a Jew.
Think about that.
I know.
Do you really, really want to open up that door?
We have a good life.
Yes. Yes.
But what if this means they've changed?
And if they haven't?
They're my parents.
-The only ones I got. -They are your parents.
Oh, God.
Oh, my goodness.
I'm sorry.
What's going on?
-Oh. -Oh, honey, um...
We got a letter from my parents, from your grandparents...
And they're coming to visit next week.
-Next-- Next week? -[Herb] Mm-hm.
They're really excited to meet you.
I won't be here. I'll be in Florida.
I'm still going to Florida, aren't I?
-Margaret, look... -No. What?
I can't even go to Florida now?
Come on, I don't even want to see them. I want to see Grandma.
I know, and we will make this up to you.
I promise, you will go to Florida, just another time.
No, I don't want to go to Florida another time.
Does Grandma know about this?
No, not yet. We have to call her.
Well, I'm not doing it. You can do it yourself.
-No, of course. Of course. -Let me handle that.
-No, I will... -Please let me call. Please.
To this beautiful day.
Just one moment.
Don't eat all the cheese without me. [chuckles]
I'm just kidding. You eat as much as you want.
Depending on your cholesterol.
I'm sure it's low.
-Simon residence. -[Herb] Hi, Mom. Yes. Um...
Herb?
Margaret's plan to come to Florida next week isn't gonna work out.
I'm really sorry.
[Margaret] Just give me the phone.
-Hey, Grandma. -Margaret, what happened? What's going on?
We got a letter that my other grandparents are coming.
And I just really wanted to see you.
Put your mother on the phone right now.
-Oh, no... -It's okay.
Sylvia.
What the hell is going on, Barbara?
Sylvia, I'm so very sorry about this,
and I will try and explain it another time.
No. You're gonna explain right now.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret.
-I'm absolutely miserable. -I am so sorry.
Everything is going wrong. Everything.
I'm begging you.
Make something happen so that they don't come
and I can still go to Florida.
Please, Margaret. Even if it's fake, can you just look happy?
Or at least not so unhappy?
Why do you even want to see them? After everything that they did to you?
Because I want them to see how great we've done.
I-- And how proud I am of our family.
-Hey! Hello. -[Barbara sighs]
That's them.
Okay.
Hi!
They might hug you, I don't know.
Just be prepared.
-Hi. -Hello.
-Hello. It's so nice to see you. -Hey.
Oh. You too, Barbara.
-Hi, honey. -Oh.
This must be Margaret Ann.
We're very glad to meet you.
-Yes, we are. Yes, we are. -Me too.
Bags! We'll get the bags.
Um, Herb is just out with the car.
-Yeah, so... Okay. -[Paul] Okay.
[Barbara] Just out here to the right. The blue car there. Yep.
Hey.
-Youse okay? Yeah? -Yeah.
Mom, Dad, you remember Herb?
-Yeah. Hello, Herb. -Hi.
-How are you? -Okay.
-Hi. Nice to see you. -Hello.
Um, should I--? I'll take this for you.
All right.
Okay.
-All right. Should I put these up? -Yes. Thank you.
Here we are. Make yourselves comfortable.
-Lovely home. -Yeah.
Thank you. Yes. Uh...
Okay. So, Margaret, can you show them to their room?
And, um, I'll just get dinner started.
Sure. Um, up this way.
[Mary] Gosh, you look just like your mom when she was your age.
[Margaret] Um, yeah. This way.
-[exhales] Hi. -Hey.
How are you doing?
Uh... How are you doing?
-I used up all my small talk in the car. -Oh, God.
Do they like sports? TV shows?
Game shows. They used to watch game shows.
Okay. Game shows, game shows.
I'm coming!
Herb!
-Mom! -Baby! Come give your mom a big hug.
-Look at your little face. -Sylvia?
Yeah. My mom is here.
Yes, she is. What's happening?
Margaret said she needed to see me, so we flew out from Florida...
Are your parents here yet?
This is Morris Binamin.
-Rhymes with cinnamon. -[chuckles]
-Hi. -[Margaret] Grandma!
There's my Margaret! Oh!
-Did you know...? -I had no... I know.
-I missed you! -[Margaret] I thought you were in Florida.
I know. Well, Florida came to you. [chuckles]
Mom, Dad, this is Sylvia. Herb's mom.
Sylvia, these are my parents, Paul and Mary.
-Hello. -Hello.
-Hello. -[Paul chuckles]
We have pot roast.
[sylvia] Sure.
-Dinner is delicious, Barbara. -Oh, my God, yes.
-Oh. -You have definitely improved.
-It is very nice. -Thank you.
Well, I have to admit, it was a bit of a jolt...
but it's nice to have everyone here together.
The whole family.
And Mr. Binamin.
Nice to have you too.
-L'chaim. -L'chaim.
L'chaim. L'chaim.
L'chaim. L'chaim. L'chaim. L'chaim. L'chaim.
To life!
-[clears throat] -So do you watch Jeopardy!?
[Mary] I used to braid your mama's hair when she was a little girl.
Did your mom ever braid your hair?
Um, yeah, she used to do it all the time.
I can see she taught you how to braid with your bracelet.
Yeah.
There's just so much we want to get to know about you, Margaret.
-Twelve years is a lot to catch up on. -Yeah. A long time.
So we were wondering...
Do you go to Sunday school? Or have you ever thought about it?
Nope. Never. Not once.
We asked Margaret the question, Sylvia.
-Margaret? -Well, you're wasting your time,
because Margaret went to temple and she's Jewish.
-[dishes clatter] -What did you say?
[Barbara] Excuse me.
Margaret went to temple.
-Mom, you're done. -What?
-[Herb] That's it. -[Sylvia] You left the room,
and they're trying to convert her.
Well, Margaret has a right to be baptized if she wants to be.
-Baptized? -[Paul] If she wants to be.
[Barbara] I can't believe this.
I can't believe you're doing this.
[Herb] Everyone, this discussion is over.
We're her parents and this discussion is over.
You're right, it's over, 'cause she's already Jewish.
-Sylvia! -Well, in our eyes, she's Christian.
No, no! Margaret is nothing!
Margaret is not Jewish or Christian.
She is no religion until she decides.
Well, how can she be Jewish if her mother is Christian?
-Stop. -You were never there for her.
-You abandoned her. -What does it matter?
Do you think that we wanted this?
[Mary] ...stole our family away from us!
Stop it!
All of you, just stop it. I don't care. I don't care anymore.
It's all just so stupid, religion! Just stop fighting!
I don't want a religion.
-I don't care. I don't care! -Margaret...
I don't even believe in God!
Are you happy? Hm?
-I'm so sorry. I did this. I am so sorry. -No, this is not your fault.
Okay, this is not your fault.
No, that was everybody else. That was not...
-Me. -No, no, no.
[Margaret] Dear Mr. Benedict...
what I learned about religion is that it makes people fight.
That every religion says the same thing.
If you pray to God, he'll listen to you, and help you, and make things better.
But I've prayed and prayed, and everything just gets worse.
Okay. We'll call you.
I don't know anymore, but I think...
that maybe the truth is...
there's nobody up there.
There's nobody listening.
There's only just...
me.
Sincerely, Margaret Simon.
Margaret.
-Hey. -Hey.
Wait. Come here.
I don't really feel like talking.
Yeah. I don't either.
But, um, I do want to say sorry for how things went.
And I know that this past year has not been easy.
Want to just sit for a minute?
Mm. Yeah. Good idea.
It gets tiring trying so hard all the time, doesn't it?
Yeah.
-[woman] I'm gonna get a sandwich. -[man] That sounds good.
-One, two, three. Cheese! -[girls] Cheese!
Junior high!
[Nancy] Come on, everybody. Margaret, come on!
Hey.
Thanks, Mr. Benedict.
You're a really good teacher.
Well, I wouldn't say all that. You know.
Still trying to iron out some of the kinks.
No, you were really good.
I'm glad you felt that way.
Hey.
Do you want to come dance? ♪ Was burning like a silver flame ♪
Really?
Yeah.
Yes! I knew it!
You basically already won.
[Gretchen] You've been going for ages.
-Ages, Gretchen? -[Gretchen] Can I please go?
Gretchen, quit complaining all the time.
I'm not complaining.
Nancy.
Come on, please?
I got it!
♪ Got what no one else had Whoa! ♪ Really nice work on the shading, Daniel.
Thank you.
I think maybe you could put a wash here,
just to blend that, but I... It's beautiful.
-Hey, Barbara! -Jan!
It's so funny to see you. I was just gonna call you.
Can you believe it, about the stars?
-Oh, I know. -Jeez.
Well, I guess everything is a fire hazard these days.
Anyway,
we're getting committees together over at the junior high,
and I can think of at least three that you'd be perfect for.
Oh, Jan, that sounds great, and I'd love to, but, um...
I don't want to.
But thank you for asking me.
Yeah.
And, uh...
-Have a good day! -Okay.
[Sylvia] I'm gonna write you so many letters.
So many letters, the mailman's gonna say, "That's it! No more!"
-[laughs] Okay. -Oh. Have the best time, honey.
We'll see you when you get back.
-See you soon, sweetie. Have fun. -Bye.
Love you. Bye!
Another day, another day...
-Okay. I think this is it. -Got it?
-Then we just have to close it. -Wai, wait, wait!
-Camera, camera. -Oh, wait.
-Yes. -[Herb] All right.
-[Barbara] Now, we just have to close it. -One second.
-Sides. Check the sides. -Got it?
-Yeah. Step on it. -Ready. Go. -[groans] Ooh. Ooh. -Oh, my God! Are you okay?
-[groans] Ooh. Ooh. -Oh, my God! Are you okay?
-Ah. Just kidding. [laughs] -Every time.
If it's there, I'll take it.
-Okay. -Good stuff. There it is.
Almost like we've done it before.
Yeah.
[Barbara] Is it lawn day?
[Herb] It is.
-We haven't paid him yet. -[Barbara] We haven't.
No. And if you wanted to go into the kitchen and grab it...
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
Hey. Hey, Moose.
Here. Dad says thanks.
Oh, thank you. Yeah.
Have a good summer. I won't be seeing you for a while.
Oh, where you going?
Camp. New Hampshire. Yeah.
-Oh. -Leaving today.
Well, have fun.
Thanks.
And I don't know.
Maybe we can hang out when you get back?
Re-- Really?
Yeah.
-[lawn mower starts] -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Mom... Mom?
Mom! Mom!
What is it? What's wrong?
I got it. I got my period.
What?
-I got it, right? -Yeah!
Yeah. Yes.
Oh, my God.
I don't know why I'm crying.
Oh, my goodness. Wow.
-Are you okay? Yeah? -I'm fine. I'm fine.
You feel...
-Do you have any cramping or...? -Yep, I'm fine.
-No. No, no, no. No, I'm fine. -No?
-I can't believe this is happening to you. -I don't believe it either.
You're a woman!
I'm a woman!
Okay.
-Get down to business. We need pads. -Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah. -Yeah.
-I bought you some. -Really?
I was gonna sneak them into your trunk at camp, you know, just in case.
Okay. One sec.
Be right there.
Okay, so...
Um, this is how they work.
-So you just put... -I know how to do it.
I've been practicing in my room for two months.

-You have? Oh, my... -Yes. Yes.
All right.
Well, then, you're... You don't need me.
Yeah.
I'll be right out here. Okay.
[Margaret] Are you still there, God?
It's me, Margaret.
I don't recall this. It's not true.
And even if it were, I have no memory of it.
-You're caught! -What are you doing? -You will die. -What are you doing?
-You will die. -What are you doing?
Long live freedom!
Farewell… Claude Pinoche.
MARIE ANTOINETTE OF AUSTRIA QUEEN OF FRANCE AND NAVARRE
I, Second Lieutenant Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, swear…
…fulfill my duties, in accordance with laws and regulations.
To promptly obey orders…
…in order to be a brave and honorable soldier…
Papi, what's wrong?
-Grab hold of him. -Mom!
Hold him up!
What's wrong, Dad?
I can't do it on my own. Someone give me a hand.
-Don't worry. He's fine. -He's not fine.
Dad!
What's happening?
-Dad! -Take his pulse.
-Stop it, Dad. -I don't know how to take someone's pulse.
Thank you, my general.
Murderer.
Heil!
NEW MARKETS NON-GLOBAL CHILE
Madam.
Let me see.
What did he eat yesterday? Same as today.
Only vegetables, as usual.
I don't get it.
He says he wishes to die, he stops drinking blood,
and now he goes off to hunt?
It is odd.
I don't want Augusto to die.
I'm at your service, madam.
Salute me, then.
Prepare yourself. My kids are coming.
To steal from my general.
To steal from me.
Allow me.
ARK
You'd think Dad would slow down in his old age, but apparently not.
We don't know who's hunting for those hearts.
-We don't? -No. Not at all.
What do you know?
The same as you.
Hey. No one here is judging you. I'm not judging you either.
We're too old to be so naive. We're clearly all here for a reason.
I came because I heard they'd give us money.
I just said that to get you here, stupid.
-So they're not giving us anything? -Please.
Of course they'll give us money. Relax.
They're not going to. Not one peso.
We have to find it ourselves.
That money's hidden in papers, documents, and folders.
People are freaked out over these murders.
Well, who wouldn't be?
Entire human hearts are being removed.
It's bizarre.
I hope they find him soon.
-Who? -The killer.
-They should've found him by now. -Who?
The police.
I just don't want them coming here. That's all I ask.
We shouldn't have to wait our whole lives to get our inheritance.
It's not that long.
But some people do live longer than they should.
-You think so? -I do.
EXTRA CONCENTRATED CHILI PEPPER
Afternoon.
Good afternoon, my general!
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
To what do I owe this delightful visit?
We were worried, Dad.
Sure you were.
I've been on the verge of death before. We've said our goodbyes many times.
Dad, someone has been feasting on hearts in Santiago.
Someone?
It could've been me… but that wouldn't make much sense.
Why would I want to keep on living in a country where people hate me?
They don't hate you.
No.
-Well, they should. -They're so ungrateful.
That is true. They are ungrateful. It's a real pain in the ass.
Though I'll admit, I've made some mistakes.
Mistakes with accounting.
Oh, really?
Well, you know.
-Know what, Dad? -No. Actually, we don't know anything.
It's a real mess.
Every day, your mom asks me about secret bank accounts
and real estate properties around the world.
I can't remember. None of it. What can I do? I haven't a clue.
And yet, the other day, thinking it over, something came to me.
What?
I've got some old books in the basement.
There, with the help of a lawyer and a former minister,
we hid some papers.
I don't know. Accounts, receipts, contracts.
Who knows? But they might be worth something.
Dad?
Why now, Dad?
Well, I'd forgotten. But now I remember.
I asked you a thousand times before.
Well, I had forgotten until now, which is why I am telling you.
Why the long faces?
You should be happy.
If those papers are worth anything, make sure you share them among yourselves.
Give half to your mom, and split the rest between you.
And with that, I'll be off. I'm tired. I believe I will die tonight.
Best of luck to all of you. I love you very much.
With all my heart. Truly.
Permission to speak freely, my general.
Go ahead.
I love you, my general.
I love you, Dad.
-I love you. -I love you.
-I love you. -I love you, Papi.
Lucía?
Don't make me say those things in front of the children.
I'm into you.
You turn me on. You drive me wild… you old minx.
Will you show me the cannons before you die?
Make me sweat like you used to?
I'll ride you like a bandit's horse.
Was it you who went out hunting?
No, madam. I don't need to.
The papers.
Madam?
The money.
Excuse me.
Why can't I seem to die?
-Because you don't want to. -Of course I do.
I've been alive for 250 years.
But we could live 250 more.
I don't want to live another 250 years. Good heavens.
Why not?
They said I was a thief.
You can call a soldier a killer, or whatever else, but not a thief.
I killed hundreds of Reds. Hundreds of them.
But, for the rest of my life, they'll say I'm a thief.
They humiliated me. They… They did.
But you did steal, didn't you?
How about this? You… bite me.
And we'll go out hunting at night.
Just for blood.
Then we'll go to the basement, where you keep the hearts.
We'll eat them.
And we'll be young again.
Then we'll go to another country, with new names.
As fifteen-year-olds.
With another army.
But I just don't understand why I can't manage to die.
You're putting blood in my food.
You're putting blood in my food to keep me alive.
-Aren't you? -No.
"President Allende, the army won't betray you!"
What?
That's what I said to him.
And then what…? I betrayed him the very next day.
It was my idea.
Yes, but no one knows that.
It was an old vendetta of mine.
I was on a mission. A mission to crush.
To crush the anarchists.
To crush the trade unionists, the Republicans, and the freed slaves.
But then you fell in love with me.
We've been together for 60 years.
What more do you want? You've had it all. Kids, grandkids…
You've been the queen of this desert.
What is there to complain about?
We have brandy every night. We talk. We sleep holding hands.
What else do you want?
To become a monster like you.
No. There has to be more than this.
Papers in English.
Bank letters, bonds, cashier's checks, bearer documents…
Things like that.
What about this?
Let me see.
Stuff like this.
Is your friend coming?
-She's not my friend. -Who's coming?
-Did you tell that accountant of yours? -I did.
He can't come. He's sending his assistant.
Now?
-It's what we agreed. -I didn't.
-Can we trust her? -Sure. She's from a military family.
-But she's a woman. -Yes.
Excuse me.
Is she young?
-Yeah. -Who cares?
As long as she understands this and doesn't talk to the press, she'll do.
Do we have to pay her?
Of course. And handsomely, so she won't become a liability.
Is this all there is?
I'll need to check with my general.
But I would say no.
We're rich, then.
We certainly are.
-Merci. -May I?
Thank you.
Good morning.
Hello. Finally. Dad!
What?
This is the accountant who's going to help us.
What's her name?
Carmen.
Carmencita.
I'm here to count your silver coins and weigh your gold.
Discreetly, of course.
That would be wonderful.
But I'm afraid I don't have much left. I'm poor.
In that case, I'll find money you didn't even know you had.
-Is that French? -Well, yeah.
Please forgive my… Do you understand my childlike French?
It seems I'm forgetting the language of my Sun King.
This language of treason and war can never be forgotten.
Perhaps.
The New Testament says that God only understands the French language.
And if I remember correctly,
it says that God listens with love to those who whisper in His ear in French.
God is in love with the beauty that He himself has envisioned.
He's a vain artist.
An artist who created women… to be perfect.
Beautifully said.
Yes.
Very beautiful, indeed.
-Thank you. -But of course.
Make yourself at home.
Excuse me.
It must be a case of possession.
Like permanently carrying
-the enemy of our Lord. -Right, but…
You think the devil got inside his body?
-Yes. He did. -How?
Sometimes he finds a way in through a wound.
This happens to soldiers on the battlefield.
Other times, he finds his way through the anus,
when a man performs acts of sodomy.
Watch your mouth.
My father was always a patriotic soldier.
Of course. It must have happened through a combat wound.
-Right. -Of course.
Hey.
What if he was born this way?
Maybe he's one of those animals…
An animal from hell?
Sure. Like a man without a soul. A dog.
Beasts do live among us.
Creatures of the devil with no soul.
Nothing but black smoke inside their chests.
They can't be saved. All you can do is kill them.
I don't want my father to suffer.
Honestly, it'll be a fierce battle.
Satan may be pathetic and melodramatic, but he is tireless.
If I run out of strength, he may kill me.
I couldn't care less.
-Oh. -I'm kidding.
-Honey? -Yes?
Treat my father with care.
Violence is the way of the devil. God's love will suffocate him.
The holy water will burn him.
Once the invader retreats, your father will be at death's door.
He will be bedridden.
If he survives, it will mean he's always had a soul.
Even if there's only a bit of good soul in there,
that soul belongs to the Holy Spirit. And I will save it.
This document mentions 12 apartments.
Investments like these that generate income without work
are common in families unwilling to work.
There should be 14.
Fourteen.
-There are no records of that here. -What?
How can properties go missing? Come on. No big deal. 12, 14. It's all the same.
Come on. No big deal. 12, 14. It's all the same.
No, we have to clear this up.
We're talking about my money here.
-Your money? -Yeah, my money.
Quiet. Let her work in peace.
Am I bothering you?
No. Nothing bothers me.
I love seeing this kind of jealousy and violence.
Irrational behavior like this will lead you to betray one another.
My strategy is to sow confusion.
Because accusations and betrayal are bound to follow.
So I'm not bothering you?
-Uh-uh. -You're bothering me. I'm trying to work.
What's this CEMA Chile?
Center for Chilean Mothers. It's right there.
ESTATE SUMMARY You diverted money from the Army's Command Headquarters,
which came from the sale of weapons and gear, to CEMA Chile, correct?
Mom?
There are no accounting documents.
It says here the president of CEMA was the First Lady. That means you.
Reserve funds were also transferred from embassy attaché offices,
from the Military Chiefs to CEMA Chile.
Just as well all this information has come to light, huh?
I don't get it.
Are we discussing your inheritance here, Mom?
-I'm not dead yet, dear. -No, but goddammit.
It's just layer after layer of lies, Mom.
Well, those lies are about to make you a millionaire.
If he's going to die, we gotta fix this.
I don't know what you're fighting over.
I'll transfer everything we find to you immediately.
-Like the winter home. -What winter home?
-In La Parva? -No, Aspen.
United States?
No way. Dad gave me that house because none of you ever cared for skiing.
-I'd like to learn. -Dad, weren't we splitting things evenly?
He gave this to me, and no one else but me.
I can't stand injustice.
I was looking over your case.
After reviewing that filthy slander…
It says you ordered the disappearance and murder of thousands of Chileans.
-Me? -Yes.
There is also evidence against you regarding secret documents.
Ill-gotten money.
Because of this, I believe that you have assets hidden from the law.
Yes. That's why I had to die. They wanted to meddle in everything.
Sure. But you didn't die when they say you did.
Even now, I can see you're breathing as healthy as an ox in spring.
-Oh, yeah? -Yes.
How about that.
Could you tell me where we might find these secret accounts?
Certainly. I had to withdraw the money because my kids don't know how to work.
-I don't want them to starve to death. -Of course.
-But don't take me for a thief. -Not at all.
Thieves steal what isn't theirs, while you use your power to get rich.
-Exactly. -Which is the only way.
I was a taciturn general.
An intellectual.
Until someone convinced me
I had to stage a coup to overthrow Allende's Marxist-Leninist regime.
After that, I was surrounded by refined gentlemen who smelled of cologne.
One very refined man came along and offered me money.
I had no idea what to do. He said, "Don't worry."
"I'll open a bank account for you in the Caribbean."
So I said, "Fine."
Not long after, he asked for a favor.
He wanted to purchase state-owned companies for peanuts.
That's when I realized this man was blackmailing me.
After that, people came from all over to talk to me.
They offered me the world. Long story short, I became rich.
So rich that Lucía got a chandelier to go over the bathtub.
I also became famous worldwide for defeating Communism.
It's a shame you fell victim to such despicable manipulation.
And that you unknowingly became involved in influence peddling.
Inadvertently receiving payoffs from soulless businessmen.
Yes, I really have been a victim in all this.
Though that's hard to believe since you are a captain general.
A hero who's supposed to be smarter than those businessmen.
Of course.
Have you ever considered donating your fortune to church-run charities?
If I did that, my children would kill me.
But isn't that what you want? To be killed?
Well, yes, but now…
I've decided it would be nice to start a new life.
Well, if you really want to repeat that same horror again,
we better find that lost fortune in these papers.
Fair point.
I ask personal questions because they're necessary for my work.
But I'm also a curious person and like to lay things bare with my voice.
That's great. Wonderful.
What are you planning to destroy in your new life?
The International Court in The Hague.
And then… I'm not sure.
I haven't given it much thought. I've only now decided to keep on living.
I hope I've inspired you with my presence.
You have.
Men of sin have told me that my body has something that invites second chances.
-What's that? -I'm not sure.
Maybe it's because I smell of bird of paradise flowers.
It could also be a new hormone that changes the aroma of my sweat.
Well, I don't… I can't quite smell your scent.
Is Dad not coming down for lunch?
Are you coming in?
Of course I am.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come…
Hail Mary…
Don't go hunting, my general.
Why not?
Don't make me waste my time. I'm helping you die.
Make no mistake. I'm not pleased with your services.
Killing Reds? Anyone can do that.
No, not just anyone.
I taught my soldiers to kill for pleasure.
And frying women's breasts with electricity,
did you do that for pleasure too?
I did it with love, even.
Pleasure…
When I finally bit you, you dropped your pants.
Why was that?
Don't go hunting, my general.
That woman, the accountant, is a nun.
She wants to cast the devil out of me.
But I…
I've got nothing inside.
Me neither.
We're two beasts of the night.
And the night is made for thieves like you.
I liked killing.
You liked stealing.
No, I liked the killing too.
But I can't live like a peasant, Fyodor.
I need something to build on. Something solid.
I need people to help me. Servants like you.
I cannot bear to wash dirty sheets.
What dirty sheets?
The ones you and Lucía will soil.
But I've never touched her.
You haven't yet?
No.
Well, go ahead and touch her.
But go easy on those howls of pleasure.
They're way too feminine.
You may keep my wife. She's my gift to you.
Do with her what you will.
But the money is mine.
May I take your picture?
You and your siblings were sent to jail in 2007 for embezzlement--
We were political prisoners.
Of course. But you were also accused of hitting--
How will you perform this exorcism?
With God's love.
And if you can't get the demon out?
-That's up to the Holy Spirit. -Screw the Holy Spirit.
What's your plan if you can't get the devil out of him?
I can kill him with a plastic bag.
-How's that? -I'll put it over his head.
Suffocate him.
-Then I'll cut-- -And his genitals?
-That won't be necessary. -Cut it all off.
Did you know about the secret papers, cashier's checks, and bearer bonds?
-Is that a yes? -Yes.
Why didn't you look for them earlier,
during all these years your father's been… a walking corpse?
Like you said, we were under investigation by those leftist judges.
It wasn't wise to come looking for undeclared money.
Anyway, my mother figured out a way to continue receiving donations.
And some of those donations made their way to us.
After the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001,
the US Senate forced several financial institutions
to lift bank secrecy to investigate how terrorism was being financed.
Damn gringos.
They just so happened to look into your family
and your accounts under false names.
Then they put Osama bin Laden's photo right next to your father's.
-How many accounts are we talking? -In the US, 125, give or take.
Give or take?
The ones the judge found. But he didn't dig deep enough.
He didn't see the ones in Germany, the Bahamas, or Gibraltar, for example.
Your father went by several aliases, including Daniel López,
to hide his illicit activities.
Why did he choose such a run-of-the-mill name?
It's not a criminal alias. No!
It's not exactly a stage name. It's a nom de guerre.
To wage war on the laws that protect the country from financial crimes.
He used it to make--
To generate an income comparable to the fortunes
of the hundreds of businessmen he helped make millionaires.
So he created a mediocre illegal alias to fulfill an entirely noble goal?
Well, it may be an illegal act according to the laws of this ungrateful country,
but a blessed act in the eyes of divine justice.
You see, our dad is a martial arts expert and can hold his breath for ten minutes.
-Or more. -More?
-Or more. -More? His pulse too.
So, on our mom's birthday, when he had that episode,
the doctors went into his room, checked his vitals, and declared him dead.
Could he do the same thing again?
No. Because now he actually wants to die.
Maybe the name came from some distant relative.
Or perhaps, back in the '80s, the captain general
killed a Daniel López, burned his body, and threw him into the sea from a chopper.
-My dad could never kill anyone. -Of course not.
His subordinates committed those heinous acts of violence.
I'm talking about your father's mysterious sense of humor.
It's possible the captain general used the name of a missing detainee
to defraud, to make a cruel joke
that only Daniel López's real killers would understand.
That's impossible. My dad hasn't got a sense of humor.
-I love him. -I know.
Do you believe in God and all that?
-Yes. In all that. -I went to a traditional Catholic school.
When Franco died, three of the nuns committed suicide.
Why does God allow the devil to live on? He could've killed him by now, right?
A sublime mystery, but we put our faith in the Lord.
We tell him that we are content not knowing his reasons
because one day we'll reside in the bristly bosom of his desires.
-Do you understand? -Of course.
But what if the devil is inside me?
I like whiskey, men, cars, and expensive sneakers.
Is that the devil?
That is definitely Satan calling.
And what does God have to offer?
Pure, true love.
My dream… is to one day look upon the face of my eternal God.
For fuck's sake.
I bet God sends us to this world to see if we're tempted by the devil.
And I was tempted. I did things… Lust, that's my problem.
I'm nasty.
Nasty nasty.
Sorry.
No, don't be. I agree with you.
In fact, I came into this world to meet the devil.
To live with him.
To love him.
To be tempted.
So he would touch me. So I could touch him.
So I could humiliate him.
So he could see me work.
You do know your sister told me everything?
What did she tell you?
Your sister called me to come save your father's heavy and seething soul.
His invaded soul.
That's exactly what we've been praying for, for so long.
All generals who win wars have the right to pillage
and make a fortune.
Of course.
And it is very sad to see that their heirs, such as you,
cannot share in the honor of their glory.
The undefeated Chilean army
allowed your father to use it to launder money?
If you think so, it could be true.
But look, years ago, I bought a steel company from the army.
Pretty cheap. Really cheap.
Because it was bankrupt.
And a couple of years later,
I sold that company back to the army for three million dollars.
That comes out to be… How much? Like 1,000% profit.
I don't know the exact percentage. I've never been good at math.
You saved the company?
No, it was still bankrupt. I didn't do anything.
So, the Chilean army bought a broke steel company
using your father's checks?
Yup.
Then you deposited those three checks, for a total sum of three million dollars,
into secret bank accounts in Washington, under false names.
Yup.
-Yup. -But it was all under the radar.
When it came to light, we weren't investigated.
We continued on with our lives as usual.
-Happy and free. -Excuse me, sir.
You're free because your father threatened a new coup if you were investigated.
Yes, but all Christian Democrats back then were in agreement.
And it really worked.
Three million dollars in personal checks. Three million.
It sounds like a lot,
but in the grand scheme of things, it's really not.
Compare it to Fulgencio Batista or Ferdinand Marcos.
Next to those guys, our fortune's a pittance.
Now, they were corrupt. And murderers too.
Your simplemindedness is fascinating.
"My father stole less than this other thief."
Only a villain can say that.
An empty husk who doesn't believe in humanity.
Thank you.
Are there more documents hidden in this house?
No.
How did they get here in the first place? Do you recall?
They were brought in by helicopter. Only I wasn't here.
And you hid them in the basement?
Perhaps.
Having to drink blood to survive.
-It must be a dreadful sacrifice. -Dreadful.
Imagine the humiliation of having to hide all that money
to sustain a never-ending life.
But where is the money?
I'm figuring it all out. But tell me.
-Are there accounts in Panama? -Yes.
-Okay. -Six of them.
Seven.
Can you wire money from those accounts now?
No, I can't.
We bought antique books, collector's items.
My dad was into that sort of thing.
-You know what I mean? -No, I don't.
My dad accumulated a ton of junk.
Napoleon's hat.
A sword owned by O'Higgins.
And a dress that belonged to some queen they had in France.
One last question.
That butler…
He drinks blood too.
He's a white Russian.
He killed thousands of Bolsheviks.
The ones in this country, of course.
Payback for the Russian Revolution that sent his family into exile.
Here, he trained torturers.
My dad bit him on the leg to thank him for his service
and give him eternal life.
But you do realize that butler is a brutish fellow.
He's only got one testicle. Just like Hitler.
And he can't eat normal food.
If he doesn't eat meat, he eats human feces.
Or animal feces.
That's why he licks the anuses of sheepdogs.
Haven't you seen him?
No.
Not yet.
You've been accused of killing over 300 political prisoners.
-You must be proud. -I am completely innocent.
You were sentenced to 865 years in prison.
I'm not sure how you can be here.
There's someone else with your name and likeness
who is in prison, serving your sentence.
I only happen to be me.
The Chilean army taught me torture as a principle.
I simply followed the instructions I was given
when I was trained as a soldier
by teachers paid by the Chilean State.
I know what you're feeling.
What?
When torturing, the promise of pain is much more powerful than actual pain.
Because during that agonizing wait, the imagination runs wild.
What are you going to do to me?
Stick something cold in you.
He won't bite me.
He won't bite me.
He went out hunting for hearts that night.
-It was me. -No.
It was me who went out hunting for hearts that night.
It was him. He dressed as the captain general.
That was me. I wore his uniform. Me.
I did it to scare your children into coming here.
-To do what? -Kill him.
My general wants to die, but he cannot.
Why not?
Someone doesn't want him to die.
Who?
I don't know… who.
You want my children to kill the general since you can't do it yourself.
I can't kill him. He bit me.
You want to keep his fortune and steal his woman?
Who is his woman?
I am.
It's me.
Not anymore. It appears he's in love with a young French accountant.
My general is fond of fine horses.
Excuse me.
I adjure you, Satan, prince of this world,
acknowledge the power and might of Jesus Christ.
He who defeated you in the desert,
vanquished you in the garden, robbed you on the cross.
And by rising from the tomb, bore off your prize to the kingdom of light.
I order you, Satan, deceiver of mankind,
to leave this creature of God, whom you have left an evil seal on.
Leave this man whom God has anointed to be a holy temple.
FINAL REPORT PINOCHET FAMILY
Me.
With these documents and this money, the Church could extort the Chilean army,
the Chilean government,
and also the businessmen who nobly donated their money, jewelry, and cash
to help Mom.
But Carmen is just a child.
A brat.
She has a perfect mind.
Beautiful and criminal.
She's better than I.
She came to steal.
That bitch.
-Bitch. -I told her everything.
She's going to steal it. All of it. That's not what he's saying.
-She's going to blackmail us. -No, you idiot.
She'll steal from us. Humiliate us.
She'll blackmail the rest.
-Was that the only copy? -We'll have to check her room.
And the money? Where is the money?
Did anyone check her suitcase?
-I don't get it. -She's going to kill him.
-The nun. -And they'll blame me.
She brought stakes and silver hammers.
-Plus holy water and some weird crap. -What?
She brought stakes and silver hammers.
-Are you deaf? -She won't kill me.
She won't.
I was tricked once. I won't let it happen again.
-And Mom? Where is she? -Off with Fyodor.
She won't kill me either. I won't let that little brat kill me.
You have to kill her.
I can't. My general would kill me first.
You're more loyal to him than to me?
Let me bite you.
-No. -Now. Let me bite you now.
I am the queen here.
Stop fooling around.
I am a foreigner to this century.
And to you, I am eternal life.
If you're going to bite me, I want you to kill the general first.
Excuse me.
I want you to win a war for me--
What?
Let me… go!
Margaret?
I don't know. I haven't a clue.
I just met her. We're going on vacation.
It's nice to see you. I thought you were dead.
But I see there are still ancient people around, like me.
Because… she's my sweetheart.
No.
You goddamn old tramp.
I always knew you were after my husband.
You bit her?
You only just met this thief, and you bit her?
Don't be a nag. You reek of Fyodor.
I can smell him from all the way over here.
Traitor.
So Mom's never going to die either?
And now Carmencita.
We're screwed. We have nothing.
What?
If Dad doesn't die, we'll never get anything.
And if they kill each other?
-Why would they do that? -Over the money?
No. They love and hate each other. They're a different species.
Why don't we kill them?
You're going to kill four vampires?
I'm not killing Mom.
Marie Antoinette.
She's yours now.
Horrendous old man.
Penniless old man.
Loveless old man!
What a pain in the ass.
You have no idea how to win a war.
It's true what they say. Beauty and wits never go together.
Our Church must be resurrected,
just like our Lord Jesus Christ.
Amen, Monsignor.
Once you finish the report, you will need to defeat Satan
and kill the vampire.
And if you find any document signed to the bearer
that may be of use to our Church, you take it.
Banks, account numbers, companies, documents signed by important people,
ministers, businessmen, whatever… let them talk.
All right.
Okay, shall we?
Dad?
Dad.
What a pain in the ass, man.
Shall we?
Dad?
Dad?
ARK
humankind's closest relatives
with many fascinating similarities.
Except for one thing.
Bonobos are extremely promiscuous,
while humans form lifelong and monogamous relationships.
Or do we?
Seventy percent of all relationships experience infidelity,
and globally, as many as sixty percent divorce.
Still, the standard norm
continues to revolve around the one lifelong love.
Why?
When our ancestors started walking on two legs
in order to find more food,
the females had to carry their children in their arms instead of on their backs,
like when we walked on all fours.
With children on their backs, the females could defend themselves.
But from this point in history,
the male had to defend both woman and child.
According to some, this was the foundation
of humankind's monogamous pair bonding.
Then came religion.
Around 350 AD,
Augustine of Hippo described man's sexuality and lust
as, "Moral decadence
that should be punished by eternal expulsion from Paradise."
Poor Augustine worried a lot about human urges
and defined marriage as an institution that would regulate them.
Marriage is acceptable for reproduction, faith and sacrament.
Without lust or passion, though.
Otherwise, you would have to burn in hell.
But the threat of God's punishment
didn't seem to stop the human urges.
Or should we say "male urges"?
Up until 18th-century Romanticism,
when emotions were finally allowed some space.
Marriage then became a twosome, a lifelong and monogamous ideal.
But the extramarital lusts would not be tamed.
Up until…
the beginning of the 1900s,
when the women's rights movement finally demanded equal rights
and equal sexual freedom.
This was a problem for the Christian church.
Would they have to handle brothels for women as well now?
Well, we know how that went.
But luckily, the women's liberation struggle continued
throughout the entire 1900s.
From the sexual revolution in the '60s,
people could sleep and live with a partner
they had picked.
The modern couple's relationship was expected to have it all.
People expected safety and adventure, friendship and sex
all under one roof in a lifelong partnership.
So why were people getting divorced more than ever?
Are there any good kids here?
Look what he brought! Huh?
Well, now we're keeping our fingers crossed.
She's in the fourth month so it should be all right.
Wow, it's amazing that you are really doing this.
A few years of changing diapers, sleep deprivation and bad finances,
that's nothing to fight about.
You got a divorce after three years.
I know what I'm talking about.
Teun and I don't trick ourselves into believing that it will be easy at any age.
Are you going to be Daddy One and Daddy Two?
No, Daddy and Daddy's boyfriend. It's Tom's sperm, so this is the future.
You know what you'll be doing for the next ten years.
Damn it, I don't want to grow up.
Adam, I don't think there is any risk that you'll ever grow up.
I think it's pretty grown up of you to move in together.
And now we are just waiting for a couple of kids too.
Yeah, we're practicing a lot. All the time.
Okay, yeah…
Cheers to you.
Cheers to the new apartment.
Cheers, congratulations.
It's fun to celebrate Christmas in summer.
-Cheers! -Cheers!
Cheers.
Yeah, Merry Christmas!
Hey, can we do the drugs soon? I'm getting really wasted.
Frida, do you have a small plate?
I think we have a plate. We have plates in the plate...
drawer.
I love you.
I love you.
PAIR BONDING
When field voles have sex,
their brains release dopamine, the reward hormone.
It makes them happy and they want more of their partner.
And it's the same for humans.
Sex produces dopamine
which creates attachment,
which is the basis of pair bonding.
Hang on. I'll just…
There.
Mm, there.
Yes, that…
Ah!
Damn, it feels as if it's been two months since we did this.
No, we screwed last Saturday.
Don't you remember?
What? Did we?
Yes we did.
It couldn't have been with me.
No, did she fall out of bed?
Maybe she hit her head on the edge of the bed.
It's all right.
God, maybe we should get a sleep therapist or something.
What?
Well, I mean, she still wakes up every night.
None of the others were like that.
I don't get it.
We haven't slept alone since forever.
Is that… Is that normal?
Do we have to talk about this now?
No, I'm sorry.
It's just…
As soon as my head hits the pillow
the thoughts appear. I'm sorry.
-Could you just be quiet for a while? -Yes, I'm sorry.
Come here, honey.
Come here.
Hold on, hold on. Condom.
Oh no, please.
Stop whining.
Just put on the condom, please.
Can't we just…
No, just put it on. How hard can it be?
I just want to feel you for real. That's not so strange, is it?
But I either stuff myself full of hormones or pieces of metal
or I'll get pregnant again,
and none of that can happen, so just put it on.
Yes, all right.
We have this discussion every fucking time.
-Spread your legs a bit. -Yeah.
There.
Okay.
Wait.
Now focus.
Harder.
What did you say?
Harder?
You want it harder?
Why do you want it harder?
Please…
Do you wish I was bigger?
No.
Stop it.
Don't ask that after three kids and ten years.
You'll walk sideways when I'm done with you.
I love being inside you.
Mommy?
-No, keep going. -Okay.
Mommy!
Just keep going! Keep going!
Stay in bed.
Mommy!
For fuck's sake.
God!
Okay, we're leaving in five minutes.
Daddy? Will I get a dog for Christmas?
What?
What did you…? No, we can't have a dog.
Not in the flat. It's not right for the animal.
-Anna? Anna! -Stop stressing. You don't need to nag.
Yes, I do. It's 7:30. Come on.
Stress is bad for your health.
-You say that yourself. Right, Dad? -Yeah, hold on.
-Brush your teeth. -Dad, you're not answering.
What did you say?
You're so annoying, you don't listen.
You're stressing me out. It's not healthy.
I know. I'm sorry, honey.
-Take these. -Okay.
-Good. -Chop-chop. Put your overall on.
-Anna, please… -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Damn it!
-Come on. -But I want the comfy socks.
Yes, but it's cold outside, so you need those.
But I want the comfy ones…
-No, stop that! -She pulled me.
-Yes, I saw that. Don't do that. -But I want the comfy socks.
They're dirty.
You have to have clean socks.
-Who's taken my water bottle? -I have your water bottle.
Say that then.
I don't want to fight with you, Louie.
All right.
These socks are good. I love these socks, Mommy.
-Do you have…? -Yeah, what?
2 DL SUGAR, 2 EGGS, 2 DL FLOUR
50 G BUTTER, 1 TSP BAKING SODA
20 MINUTES
What's this?
Do all of you know what that is?
Yes?
A cake.
Yes.
But not just yet, right?
Yes, Liam.
It's a recipe.
Exactly. It is.
And what do we need recipes for?
For baking cakes, for example.
Exactly.
Yes, we do.
And if we didn't have a recipe,
the cake might be too hard or soggy.
Or we might get a lasagna instead.
-That's not what we wanted. -No.
Right? So, a recipe is an instruction.
We use the recipe as an instruction.
And it's the same thing with computers.
It's so good.
But dear friends, let's not get too comfortable, okay?
The Christmas bonus doesn't create itself.
And you want that new car, right?
Don't you? Don't you?
Yes, you do.
Now back to work. Come on. Get out of here.
Scram, scram, scram.
Stefan, the presentation was awesome.
And Monica, let's talk for a second.
Easy for her to work 24/7 when she doesn't have anything to come home to.
-What? Have you been to her place? -Stop it.
-Have you slept with her? -No.
No, but she says it herself. She doesn't want a family.
She just wants to live life.
Yeah, well, I can relate to that.
But check this out.
Who wants a car when you can get one of these?
-Whoa. -Right?
Where did you find it?
Bangkok. It was pretty cheap as well.
I've been emailing the store owner. He seems really cool.
It looks good.
With that one… We'll get all the way to Nepal in it.
I can hardly wait.
Me neither.
You know…
Shit, are you going home?
No, I'm working another couple of hours.
Child-free week.
Right, good for you.
Have fun.
Yep.
Hello, hello. Hi.
-He's reading. -"Then
the snake said
that she…"
So you can't even say hi?
"…eat the apple, but…"
You are my little honey.
-No, goddamn it! -What did I do? What happened?
-I almost dropped it. -I just wanted to give you a hug.
It's just that Leo's been looking forward to reading that book to us.
Did you buy detergent?
What book are you reading, Leo?
-Hi, dad. -Hi.
We're reading Alex and Eve at school.
Adam and Eve, honey.
Alex and Eve sounds nice.
-Did you? -No, I'm afraid I forgot.
-But I got wine. Would you like some? -No, thanks.
-No… -Daddy, do you want to hear it?
-I'd love to hear it. -Listen.
-Okay. -"One day when Eve was in…"
Anna, we're eating. Come on
Hi, sweetheart. Are you hungry?
Good.
We had a little accident at school today.
-Yeah, I get it. -So I need to wash.
I get it, but I forgot to buy it, okay?
-Right… -Seriously, pasta today again?
If you don't like it, you can go to bed without dinner.
And I'll take this one. The end.
You can't just take it like that.
Yes, actually, I can
because now we're going to have dinner together.
Come on, let's eat.
When you study, I don't interrupt you, but now…
Why do you do that to me?
Mommy, tell him. He took my book.
Why did you have to take the book right now?
But, honey, he didn't mean to just take it, okay?
Let's eat first and then we'll read the rest. Okay, sweetie?
-I'm angry! -Yes, that's enough!
Enough. We've heard that you're angry.
Hey.
The faster you eat,
the sooner we can cuddle up on the sofa and read it later, okay?
Okay, sweetie?
Hey, take it easy, okay?
Come and sit down, let me show you.
Wow.
Wow… So you are really going?
My God, yes.
-For real? -Of course-- Yes, for real. Of course.
Yeah.
It's so cool.
Yes, it really is.
Louie needs a bath. Anna had homework, so I was thinking…
Could you do bath time? Thanks.
Björn?
Björn. Go to bed.
Björn?
BOREDOM
I think we had sex
six times an hour in the beginning.
Yeah, back then… We went at it. Yeah, we did.
Then it became once a month
and now it's…
Well, what is it now?
Now it's…
The testosterone levels drop like crazy after the honeymoon.
Yeah, it's…
We men often joke about it.
"What was that?"
"The testosterone level!"
On top of that, you have to admit that it's…
You don't have to flex your muscles in order to catch her.
Yeah, we have each other.
And that's good too.
I think.
Right, honey?
Don't we?
Right.
Spare clothes, cookies, water.
We have everything.
We're off now.
-What? -Yeah, I told you an hour ago.
You even replied.
What did you say?
Isn't today Saturday?
They've been up for hours and need to get out before they strangle each other.
Okay.
Can you vacuum while we're gone?
How are you?
There is nothing new at all. Nothing.
It's just work, kids, kids, work.
-How's your new apartment? -It's nice.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
-I want to visit. -Yes, of course.
Olli seems happy.
Yeah.
I hope so. I mean, it's very small.
But it's enough for the two of us.
And you?
It's all good.
Have you met someone?
What?
No, absolutely not.
Not met somebody,
but there's a young, fit little thing
who comes over for tea now and then.
-Is that so? -I'm almost ashamed.
Because I feel like my life is totally perfect right now.
For real. I get the best of both worlds.
I get one entire week when I can be with Olli
and be 100% present as his mom.
And then I get one week when I can binge-watch TV shows,
not eat gross kid's food,
and recharge my batteries.
Of course, I miss Olli a lot when he stays with Adam.
I can't even think about it. But I couldn't stay in what we had.
I know.
It was a nightmare putting them to bed.
Goodnight.
Are you happy? With our life?
Yes, really happy, honey.
Why do you ask?
I don't think you are. Or that I am.
I see.
Do you miss being on your own?
What?
Not as in being single, but…
Just doing something for you,
being yourself, being ourselves.
Well, of course there are things that I miss doing,
but I can still do them.
It's just that the days are so packed right now…
-But are you really happy? -Well…
Because it feels like we're just living a routine,
you and I.
Maybe you should think more about yourself,
take it easy, chill a little.
Yeah.
But it's not that easy
with three kids and a full-time job.
Yes, it actually is.
You just have to do it.
That's just bullshit.
It's not realistic.
How are we supposed to take it easy with homework, clubs and cooking--
Why do you think I'm planning this motorbike trip?
That's exactly my point.
It feels as if you're escaping from our life.
Hang on. You just said that we should do things on our own.
You said that. Then you can do things on your own too, right?
It's not that easy. That's what I'm saying.
Yes, it is easy, but you're complicating it.
You don't have to get up at 6:30 every fucking day.
You don't have to cook every night.
We could solve it.
You don't have to wash clothes all the time. They're not that dirty.
Yes, I do. What the hell do you mean?
I mean that you can relax a bit.
Who will do everything then?
I'll sleep on the couch. I can't handle you right now.
Yeah, that's great.
That's just perfect.
Great problem-solving.
I'm just saying that I'm not like you.
-No. -No.
I can't just turn off my family.
I can't sleep in every Saturday.
I can't.
And I'm not dreaming of traveling through Europe
on some motorbike trip with my friends.
I'm not.
I'm here and now in my life,
and I've chosen that.
It feels like you're always dreaming
about being somewhere else, not here.
Okay, that's how you feel, but I… What do you want me to say?
I want you to talk to me. We have to talk this through.
We're always tired and it's never the right time,
but when I try to talk to you, you want to walk away.
Right?
Maybe we should talk to someone.
Like a couples therapist.
Well, I feel good, Frida. But maybe you need therapy.
Well, that's fucking unfair, Mr. Anal Porn.
I know you want more in life
than fucking Friday tacos and everyday sex.
Why can't we talk about it?
Do something about it.
Like, I don't know…
Take a break,
or maybe try involving a third person, or…
-Or maybe not. -No.
But I know there are things that we could do.
We just need help.
Everyone goes to therapy, why not us?
Hang on. Listen to me.
We're not going to take a break. Forget that.
And the thing with a third person… Have you been smoking something?
And therapy isn't always the answer.
At least not for me.
So what should we do?
Maybe go out and have some fun?
REIGNITION
Oh my God, yes.
It was the same thing for us.
When our oxytocin levels plummeted,
we became like brother and sister.
Well, I was as horny as always,
but you know,
you don't sleep with your brother.
So the zoo tried to boost our hormone levels again.
They thought we were getting too passive.
Yep.
So they gave us some new toys.
At first I found it ridiculous.
I mean, was he supposed to try and get a six-pack?
But then…
What can I say?
Just check out those abs.
It really boosted our chemistry.
Is she asleep?
-Like a little bear. -Good.
-Damn, you're hot. -Stop it
I'll just put it in there.
Stop it. I only feel tired.
I guess I'll leave then.
Or should I wait for you?
-No, don't worry. Mom will be here soon. -Okay.
We could meet up later if you want.
Unless I fall asleep at dinner.
I'm pretty sure that your party friends
will have something to keep you up all night.
That feels fucking adolescent.
Nobody has taken drugs for like a hundred years.
And who would take care of the kids tomorrow?
Well, excuse me. They do have a dad as well.
I can take the kids first thing, so go out and have fun.
I think you need it.
Okay.
Have a good time.
-Bye. -Bye.
-Hello! -Hi!
Hi!
Hello.
-My turn. -I can't take it anymore.
Ouch!
That sounds fantastic. Just you two?
Yeah, sure. It's… Thank you.
-We're talking about the trip. -Right.
It's going to be awesome. Martin and I, endless dirt roads.
We've been doing these trips since we were, like, 20.
Like, 20?
And now you're, like, 21?
You two…
-Cheers. -Cheers.
I love motorbike trips. Love it.
What, do you ride a bike?
Do I ride a bike? Are you kidding me? Love it.
Awesome. Great.
It's the best way to see the world,
if you ask me.
-I agree. -It's wonderful.
-Butterfingers. -What?
Dropped it.
What did you say?
What did you drop?
Hello. Do you need help?
No, I think I'll manage. Thanks.
It's great.
Listen, guess what I've got.
-What? -I thought we should party.
-No… -Yeah, come on.
-Here? -Yes.
Now?
-What's up? -No, fun. Fun!
-What, are you leaving? -I'll be right back. I'm getting ice.
-The naming. -No, our last party was a christening.
-Cheers. -My God, I'm so passé.
Honey, stop it. You look fantastic.
The party doesn't stop in the suburbs. It's just a bit different.
He's right. I've never seen so many swingers, so many drugs.
It's a circus out there.
Are you kidding? What suburb are you living in?
For real?
-How does that work for you? -Let's take that later.
-I want to know. -Later…
Hey, guys.
Speaking of swingers and drugs,
Mommy has a present for you!
People have started using MDMA for therapeutic reasons.
I have a lot of traumas that I need to work through,
and you obviously need to relax,
so here's to being out-of-date and less serious.
And to meeting more often?
We will.
Here's to everybody being more open to new adventures.
-Which I am. -Cheers.
-Björn will see to the kids tomorrow. -They'll look after Björn.
-God, I love Björn. -Here's to Björn.
Here's to Björn.
Oh, damn it.
After all the PowerPoint presentations,
the boss needs to get laid and take it easy, so…
What? You can't say that.
That's politically incorrect.
But you can screw her if you know what women need.
Oh, yuck. No, no, no.
What about you, Björn? What do you need?
-I need a drink. What would you like? -I…
-Sex on the beach, please? -Sex on the beach…
Two sex on the beach, please.
Sex on the beach? Yes, please.
Hey.
-I can't. -No?
-It won't end well. -Are you sure?
I'm sure.
I'm married. I'm not, you know, that kind of guy.
-What? -No worries. Sorry.
It won't end well.
I'm just teasing. I wasn't being serious.
No, your feet are flirting.
But listen, you need to know that I will suck your cock anytime.
And I mean anytime. Let me know.
Okay.
-Okay? -Okay. Thank you.
One word.
-Okay, cheers. -Cheers.
THE COOLIDGE EFFECT
We had an important visitor on the farm.
President Calvin Coolidge was here.
And his wife Grace asked,
"How often does the rooster mate?"
"Dozens of times a day," the farmer replied.
"I see," Grace said.
"Tell my husband."
Then the President asked,
"Is it with the same hen every time"?
"No," the farmer said.
"It's a new hen every time."
"Oh," the President said.
"Tell that to my wife."
You have to control your own narrative.
Look at me and Teun. We handled our problem.
-We threw the screen out. -Out with the screen!
-In with the family therapist. -And the potter's wheel.
Damn, it isn't easy to live.
No.
You actually do have a choice in life.
Live it any way you want.
I mean, ours isn't Instagram perfect,
but at least it's ours.
Right?
-It's really… You're lovely. -I mean it!
I only mean that a psychologist and meditation isn't always the solution.
But screwing is nice.
Not everybody is built for kid's yoga,
but read about the consequences of these fucking screens.
-Good. -Yes. Have you read Sherry Turkle?
-Sherry who? -No.
The conversation of… She's been writing for forever about
how too much screen time affects children's brains and empathic abilities.
I agree. Oliver can become almost like a zombie in front of his iPad.
After ten minutes it's like, "I feel nothing."
Now I can't… I can't feel anything.
You're my idols.
You are. I love you.
Björn and I really need
some ceramics and a couples therapist right now.
-Linda! -What? Oh my God!
Shit, it's been ages.
-Hello. -Hello.
-Yes. -But… It's been ages!
-May I join you? -Yes.
Oh, nice!
I stank like a fucking pub.
You fell out of that place and landed horizontally.
-They called the police. -No.
-Yes. -Yeah, they did.
I had to come up with a story that you had an allergy or something.
And I said, "I'll try to get him home."
Well, did you?
-Did I? -No!
-I put you in a taxi. -Yes.
-Epic. -We didn't see each other for years.
It was too embarrassing.
-Now you understand why she chose Björn. -Yes, you do.
But you're here now, honey. Cheers!
-Cheers. -Cheers!
Here's to many embarrassing memories.
I have to get back to my party. See you later?
Yes, of course.
-See you. -Bye, Ben.
It was great seeing you.
-Yes. Good to see you. -Bye.
Wow, what a…
Linda, stop it.
It must be strange to see him.
-It was a long time ago. -It didn't feel like it.
I have three kids. Stop it.
-Can't you laugh about it? -Wow, so sensitive.
"I have three children!"
-Hi. -Hi.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm great.
You look amazing.
You too.
-And how's the family? -Everybody's fine.
-That's great. -And you?
Yeah, I'm doing great.
We… We had our second a year ago.
We're separated…
Oh no! How sad.
No, calm down. It's super.
It was the best thing that could have happened to us.
-Okay. -Yes.
Yeah.
But will you move back here, then?
Yes, we're moving back here.
-Right. -Yes.
Okay.
But hey, maybe we'll see each other later.
Yes, or we could have
a cup of coffee together, if you like?
-Oh, hello. Hi. -Hi.
-Okay. -Hello.
-There you are. -I…
Whoops!
PAIR BONDING PATTERNS
The results from a study
showed that prairie voles,
just like rats and hens,
are motivated to bond with their partner during the mating phase
because of increased dopamine levels.
But if you give them a dopamine blocker,
they no longer preferred the partner they mated with.
But if they were given dopamine,
they preferred any partner.
That reminds me of a study that is pretty well-known.
It is about T-shirts that women get to smell,
full of sweat from men.
They preferred some over others.
And those T-shirts
had a gene variant
that was very different from the woman's own variant,
when it comes to the immune system.
That is important.
Women who had a partner with the same kind of gene variants,
the others were different,
but this was the same variants as they themselves had…
Those women were more often deceived by their partners.
They got to experience more unfaithfulness.
I find that fascinating.
We did a study with 552 male twins living in relationships.
We found that the ones carrying one or more gene variants
in the attachment system,
they were lacking, or having a problem with
bonding with their partners.
But when it comes to women,
since they lack those alleles in the attachment system,
we instead studied the DRD4-gene,
or allele, also known as the kick-seeking dopamine gene.
And we found that the ones with this variant
also had a higher frequency of one-night stands
and fantasies of infidelity.
So both of the systems seem to contribute to patterns of infidelity.
Björn! They're here in a couple of hours.
Can you join us?
Yes, and that leads to a very important question.
Is monogamy based on inheritance or environment?
Teresa, are you sitting here?
-Do you want some more wine? -Yes, please.
-Björn, can you set the table? -Not now.
I have to serve our guest of honor some wine.
Yes.
Where is Dad?
You know what he's like.
He's lying on the couch watching us while we do the dirty work.
We have to excuse Jon.
It's too much for him with so many people.
Oh, it looks lovely, Frida.
You make Mommy proud by sticking to our tradition.
What tradition?
Sweetheart, don't you remember?
No, of course not. You were so little back then.
But I had to keep my mother-in-law happy
and struggle with that darn French duck every Christmas.
-Mom, we never had duck in Norway. -No, we didn't.
Don't be ridiculous, Joanna. I remember what I did and didn't do.
Why would you say that?
Okay, take it easy. We just can't remember the duck.
That's great.
-That's great. -It sounds wonderful, Teresa.
But I remember something about a duck the year your dad died.
-That's right. -Exactly.
Did someone die, or what?
Maybe you should help set the table, Jon.
Yes.
This one is wonderful, Frida.
-We're going to try it, you and I. -Yes, we are.
Marianne, would you like a glass?
But Teresa, you're right.
It was the Christmas when we had the entire French side of the family over.
Yes, that's right,
and that wasn't the only time, just to let you know.
Okay, Mom. It doesn't matter.
But hey, I thought I heard Louie shout.
-Could you check on the kids? -Sure.
Thank you.
And I was the one who cooked the duck.
And now I've done it again. Voilà!
-Bravo. -Dinner is served in two hours. Okay?
Wow.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
-And merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas!
Yes, and finally, we performed a study on a group of women.
We gave half of them a nasal spray containing the cuddle hormone, oxytocin.
And the other half
received a placebo spray,
that is, a spray without any effect.
And it turned out that the women who received the oxytocin spray
were more likely to bond
than the ones who didn't get it.
So to conclude, I would claim that human monogamy
and infidelity,
just like with the voles,
to a large extent depends on our genetic make-up.
Yes, a minor hormonal adjustment could change a lot in our world,
both at the micro and the macro level.
I really thought that we were going to be able to work through this.
But does it have to be so definitive?
I really hope not.
What the hell was that?
There you are, you fucking cunt!
And you, fucking…
Your disgusting girlfriends… You know what? Burn in hell!
Fucking cunts. I hate you!
I don't want this car!
I don't want that flat!
I don't want anything from you!
Get that?
Do you get what you've done?
Were you thinking about the kids?
Were you thinking at all about the kids
when you spread your legs like some fucking slut all over town?
Fuck you! Go home to Norway.
Do me that favor.
Are you insane?
What's wrong with you, you fucking psycho?
Don't you think I know about your fucking text messages?
Do you think I'm a fucking idiot?
Don't you think I know what you've done? I know everything, fucking hypocrite!
You're just as complicit!
You are. It's just as much your fault!
And don't try to make this about the kids.
Because it's about you, fucking dick,
and about how bloody selfish you are!
You're up your own fucking asshole, that's what you are.
Yes, I slept with him!
Who the hell cares?
Who the hell cares about that?
I wanted to be with you! It was you I wanted.
But you ignored our family.
You ignored me!
Because you are a fucking dickhead!
So fuck you!
Go to hell!
BEER RESTAURANT
This isn't very smart, bro.
This won't look good if you want to push the custody thing.
I mean, you have to get a grip. Get your life under control.
Like hell I will.
I don't give a shit how it looks.
She has ruined everything. She's destroyed my life.
-I hate her. -No, I don't think you hate her.
Anyway, you can't walk around moping like this the whole time.
-Yes, I can. -No.
-Can too. I'm sitting here. -No, you can't.
-It's easy to mope. -It's been months…
Hi! How are you doing?
-Hi. -Long time, no see.
-Good to see you. How are you? -Good.
I quit drinking a while back,
but it got so fucking boring that I started again.
But Oliver is good, Linda is good.
We're still separated,
but she's easy to get along with, so…
-Right. -Yep. And you?
-Yeah, it's… -Well…
We're celebrating that Björn got rid of his car today.
-You sold it? -What?
No, I didn't sell it, I…
took the keys and crashed it into a house on the street where we live.
-Really? Is that true? -Yeah, just now.
Wow, okay. Let's toast to that. Excuse me?
Three Golden Slammers, please?
-So now she doesn't have a car. -There's a thing.
Yeah, so now I'm a dad every other week at home with the kids,
and every other week I sleep on Martin's couch.
-So you're doing birdnesting? -That's what she wanted.
Bird nest?
Yeah, well…
The kids stay, the parents move in and out.
I see. People didn't do that when I separated.
Linda and I did it in the beginning.
It might be good for the kids, but it's goddamn horrible. Horrible!
Yeah, incredibly tough.
-But, are you looking for a flat? -Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
I will not live in the same house as that fucking bitch.
I promise you. I'll find something.
My sister is moving in with her boyfriend and has to rent out her flat.
-Really? -It's small, in town. Yeah.
Really nice, ordinary. Cheap, you know. Interested?
Yeah.
-I'll check it out. -Sure.
-All right. -Cool.
-Cheers, then. -Cheers.
Whatever.
Okay, honey.
-Mom, are you picking me up today? -No, it's Dad's turn.
Remember?
But I'll miss you.
Ah, honey.
I'll miss you too.
Okay?
I'll miss you too.
You know what?
It's good to miss me, you know?
It's good.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be so great to see each other again.
No.
So it's good that you miss me.
Okay.
Okay?
Look what I have. Here.
Ta-da!
Always have a piece of chocolate in your jacket pocket.
Yeah.
Mommy loves you.
Okay?
Shall we go in?
Yes, come on.
And he doesn't see how it affects them.
He wants to punish me, but right now, it's the children he is hurting.
And he's serious about going to court.
He doesn't care if the kids have to be evaluated by a psychiatrist.
I can't even think about how traumatic that would be for them.
That must be really hard for you.
I know that I was the one who…
That I was the one who started it all.
And I have to live with that.
But I hoped that he would…
that he would wake up…
So that we could
work on our problems
and everything would be good again.
So you felt that he didn't communicate and wasn't attentive
even before you separated? That he was shirking responsibility?
-Is that right? -He didn't want to engage.
And what would happen if he didn't deal with things?
It feels like you're worried
that something might happen if he didn't act.
I don't know if anything would happen,
or if the thing was that nothing happened.
That we stagnated and…
Yeah, that we were over.
You were afraid of losing him.
And I felt like I had already lost
both myself and him.
And so then I hoped that he would
see that.
Or see me, kind of.
And work on us instead of running away.
In a way, you ran away first.
Frida, let's separate things out a bit.
It wasn't part of his personality
to deal with things in the same way you did,
even before you separated.
That's the way he was then, and that's the way he is now.
You can't do anything about that.
Only he himself can change that, if he wants to.
It's not your job. It's not your responsibility.
You have no control over that.
And the same is true for you.
Now you've separated,
and he doesn't want to have any contact.
You need to accept that
and learn to handle the situation,
instead of waiting for him to change
or be in constant conflict with him.
And this isn't about if somebody loves or not.
That's who he is.
He is very different from you.
Okay, come here.
You can dance more when we get home.
And switch… No, you can't hold the monkey.
-Yes. -No, Lou… Don't do that.
It'll just get silly.
Good, let's see. Come on.
-Stop it. -Ow, Daddy. That hurt!
-Okay, sorry. -No, I want Mommy!
-But… -No, don't touch me!
-I have to touch you. -Don't touch me! No!
Honey, Louie…
-I don't want to! -No, but Anna is picking up Leo.
We have to hurry home to them. We can't…
I'm doing my best, damn it.
Can't you give it a rest?
-Please? -I don't want to!
Hello, Björn.
Right? Hello.
There. Okay, we'll leave it.
We took a long walk today, so she's probably a bit tired.
Okay.
It's like that.
Let's go. You'll have to be cold then.
Can we…? Let's go.
Don't forget your bag.
No.
Here's your… There's my bag, damn it.
Thank you for today.
See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow. -Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks for being here.
I was nervous, but it's just furniture.
It'll be fine. He's probably been nice.
I mean, you own half of it.
What do I tell the kids?
What do you say?
I don't know.
I'm really trying.
-I'm trying to do everything right. -I know.
It's our fucking duty to the kids.
And he's just pissing on me. He pisses on me every chance he gets.
Because he's a fucking dick.
I don't know why he's doing this.
Okay? I'll get you some coffee. You need some coffee.
But he's taken my kettle.
I can't even make a fucking cup of coffee.
And I got it.
I got it from his mother as a birthday present. You see?
Okay, then I'll boil water in a pot on the stove.
Hey.
You don't have to make a perfect home.
There are no perfect homes
and the kids will adapt.
Buy an air mattress.
Build a fort.
It'll be all right.
Mommy, come and jump!
Mommy, come on!
No, I don't think I'm allowed. The bed will break.
-No. -Stop.
-Read the sign. They want you to jump. -Please, come on.
Come on, it won't break.
-Come here. -Come on.
Come on, come on.
Up you get. You can do it.
It won't break.
-We promise. -Come here.
She fits in very well with the rest of the kids
and gets along with most of them.
She is popular and radiates a lovely energy.
In general, we see no problems with Louie.
None whatsoever.
That's fantastic to hear.
Well, we are,
or I am, always worried that she doesn't
express herself well
or communicate with others.
So yeah, that's really such a relief to hear.
Yes, as you know, Frida chose to split our family a while ago,
and it's been damn hard.
And the kids are very miserable, traumatized.
It's no fun and games at home, but it's…
How do you put it? That's what happens when one person in a family
chooses to think about their own needs, isn't that right?
Well, of course, we're used to these types of situations.
And the majority of the kids here live in modern family constellations.
And that doesn't have to mean trauma for the kids, per se.
As long as the parents can work together.
As Mona said,
Louie is fine and expresses herself well.
As long as the kids are extroverted,
it's a good sign.
It's when they get quiet that we get worried.
Acting out is both normal and healthy.
So if Louie gets sad or angry during this period,
that's totally okay.
And as Bo said, we are all in agreement
that she is doing great.
Thank you.
Yeah, and tell us if anything changes,
or if there's something that we should focus on.
Well, I don't want to communicate with this person, so we could…
If we could stay in contact separately, that would be great.
-Absolutely. -Of course.
We'll let you know of any concerns.
And you can always grab us, if…
If you have any thoughts or worries.
Great. Bye.
-Thank you. -Thank you, Mona.
-Bye. -Bye.
Björn?
Björn. Please, wait.
Please, let's talk about this?
Can't we talk?
Please, Björn, can't we stop this custody thing?
You should have thought of that before you destroyed our family.
No, I'm not stopping "the custody thing."
Please, Björn, we're in this together.
Do you want to subject the kids to the damn psychology tests
just to prove you're right? Is that what you want?
I apologize to you.
I do.
For real.
-I'm sorry about… about everything. -Okay.
-I am. -Yeah…
But don't do this to the kids.
-They'll be scarred for life. -Am I doing this to the kids?
You thought psychologists was the answer to everything.
You're the one who scarred them for life when you left us.
You were the one who wanted a divorce, not me.
And this isn't about your fucking needs,
or about the kids' needs, for that matter. It's about my rights.
And I will have them, as you're not a fit mother to my kids.
You are totally reckless.
You're destroying the kids' lives,
destroying the kids' dreams,
destroying the kids' future,
so now we'll do this my way!
Come on, get a grip!
Björn, damn it!
None of us were happy!
We had a crisis
and you didn't admit that.
You couldn't talk about it.
That's such fucking bullshit, and you know it.
You don't have to talk everything to death.
Some things sort themselves out!
You wanted a divorce, but you won't get your way anymore.
Enough is enough!
Did you see me dream about some fucking backpacking trip in Asia?
No, because I was too busy living our life, Björn!
I wanted to be in our life, Björn! Do you get that?
And I didn't just suggest therapy. I was open to anything.
A break, a threesome or whatever!
But you just didn't care!
But you know what? We were unhappy!
Both of us. We were so fucking unhappy.
And you did nothing about it.
You did nothing!
I'm sure that's your explanation, Frida. That's yours.
But if you want to hear mine, it's a little different.
Because you wanted to be alone, and now you'll get a taste of it.
You're not taking my kids! They'll live with me!
But we're their parents, both of us.
They need us both.
And then we have to…
We have to communicate. This isn't communicating!
No, exactly. I don't want to communicate with you!
Are you stupid?
I don't want to communicate with you.
And there'll be no hippie Christmas. This is what's going to happen.
I'll take the kids to my parents and you can have them New Year's Eve.
End of discussion.
Hello, and welcome.
Aren't you coming up?
The kids have to get their presents.
I thought we'd have coffee.
Yes.
Hello, my honeys!
Hi, Mom.
You look so smart!
We're going to Grandma's.
-And we'll get a surprise. -I know.
It's going to be so much fun!
Here you have some more surprises.
Some candy for the journey.
And Leo, your teddy. Here.
Okay, have the best Christmas ever.
And call me if you want something.
Or if you feel like it.
-What are you going to do? -Won't you celebrate?
Yes, for sure.
I have a lot of tests to grade.
And then I'll probably go to Aunt Joanna's.
But first, I have to call Santa Claus,
so he has Grandma's address.
I think we have to go now.
But let's say goodbye.
You can't go without giving Mommy a kiss. Come here.
Love you, sweetie. Okay?
Give me a hug.
I love you. Love you.
I love you so much.
-Okay? -Bye, Mom.
-Bye, Mom. -Bye.
-I love you. -I love you. Bye.
-Bye. -Bye.
-Bye. -Bye.
-Now it's a snake and now an elephant! -No more magic, little Louie.
-Take off the costume. -I don't want to.
It's been a really cozy Christmas, but it'll be too warm.
I want to show it to Mommy!
You can show it to Mommy when you see her, okay
I want Mommy!
I want Mommy too.
Honey, come here.
Just like Mommy. Come and sit here.
There, there.
Come here.
SEPARATION TRAUMA
Separation anxiety,
or depression.
It's comparable to drug withdrawal.
You even have a reduced immune defense.
If you were a man, I could recommend a glass of wine or two.
But the female body's dopamine system
isn't triggered by alcohol in the same way.
I could give you an oxytocin shot
in order to start your own dopamine flow.
Or antidepressants.
I think you have to get through this.
Try to look forward.
Do things that make you happy.
No, I'm not going to start using Tinder. I won't do it.
I'd rather die than subject myself to--
So damned pretentious!
It's such a disgusting, dehumanizing way to socialize.
I mean, why…
Why don't we have one of those SCRUFF apps?
Just for sex without having to talk and be bored
before you go to bed.
Isn't that wonderful?
Yes, because I'm done with the love thing.
Nothing would happen anyway,
if I shared my GPS coordinates on some damn app.
Girl, it's 2021!
That's how Tinder works.
Imagine that you're at a buffet and you're starving.
Now you can choose the tastiest bits.
You can get exactly what you want.
But who would want me?
There comes a time when you have to move on.
So I went to therapy and looked inward.
So now I have…
It's over. That chapter is finished.
-Well done. -Yeah.
-And it happened fast. -Yeah.
Just half a year. You're awesome!
What?
We only live once.
I couldn't waste any more time on figuring out why it wasn't working.
It wasn't working. And it's complicated.
Now it's over.
We've got routines and it's working.
No drama.
Time to live a little.
I wish I could say the same.
Is it that bad?
Yeah, but…
I cheated, so I asked for it.
It's usually about something else, isn't it?
Believe me, I know.
-Didn't I tell you? -No.
My ex met somebody else, and so…
That forced me to…
wonder if I could have done something different.
There's two of you in a relationship.
That's also a way of looking at it.
Are you sad that it didn't work out?
Yeah, I am.
I could have done a lot of things differently.
I could have been quicker
in communicating and addressing what went wrong,
instead of subjecting us to what I did.
I think mostly it's that feeling of betrayal which is hard.
And if you can't discuss it, then…
For us, it became an opening to have a talk about whether
we'd be happier apart.
Yeah.
I don't think our relationship could withstand that sort of honesty.
And that's why it's over.
That's not a relationship you want.
What kind of relationship do you want?
Okay, bye.
Bye.
-Can I take this off? -Yeah.
I'll do it.
What the hell.
Hang on.
-It's okay. -Sorry.
-No. -How annoying.
-Damn it. -It doesn't matter.
Yeah, but what the hell.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
It's okay.
I'm really sorry. I'm super horny.
It's never happened before. Never.
No, I get it.
We're also going through a divorce.
I get it.
I see. Difficult?
No, it's not particularly difficult at all, actually.
No?
I knew at the wedding that it wouldn't be forever.
But you have kids.
Yeah, we do.
You have different relationships for different needs.
He gave me a daughter, I'm happy about that.
But don't fret about this.
It's really no big thing. I've seen it a lot of times.
Take a blue pill if you need to.
-Right? -Yeah.
-It doesn't have to be that complicated. -No, right.
But, hey…
I'd love to.
Bye. Take care.
Bye.
SURVIVAL
So you lost the spark in life?
Yes, but I survived.
I tried to find somebody new.
I didn't want to live alone.
This isn't the best time of my life.
-No, definitely not. -But I've stayed clear of drugs.
It's…
It's just that I don't know how I'm going to get over it.
What's going on?
Well,
I joined a scientific study.
The scientists call it a forced swim test.
-That's what you see behind us. -Interesting.
Voles who have gone through a separation,
they just sink.
-Straight down. -They just sink.
So they don't swim?
No, they just sink.
The others, the ones who are in a relationship,
they swim for dear life.
They keep going.
Keep swimming.
They have something to live for.
So the conclusion is that relationships keep us alive.
That's why we seek duality.
Over and over again.
Over and over again.
Björn!
Hi!
Hi!
But…
-What's up? -Hi.
-Hi. -How are you?
Good, thanks. Good to see you.
Wow. Long time no see.
Definitely. What…
But what are you doing here?
We're meeting the principal.
Oliver isn't happy in his old school, so he might transfer here.
Okay, that's nice.
Leo's theater group has a show on…
-Really? -Fun.
Yeah.
-It was really nice seeing you. -Likewise.
I heard about the custody thing.
Great that's it's solved.
Yeah.
Well, I'm in therapy now.
-Wow. -Yeah.
So that's good.
Awesome.
Not having all that anxiety and bitterness…
-Yes. -Fucking awesome.
I think that you just have to make a decision, somehow.
About what you want and there's no right and wrong, but…
-No. -Just make a decision.
What? Are you…
Are you together again?
Sorry, I'm trying to…
We're not moving in together again…
No, never.
We're trying something new.
We have each other, but with more freedom.
Okay, good for you.
We're dating others, but together.
Yes.
Wow. Good. Congratulations.
-Thank you. -Are…
We have to go, but it was very nice to see you.
Likewise. Okay, good luck.
-See you. -Yeah, sure.
-Say hello. -I will.
It's time to call in the animals.
Who are you?
I'm a rooster. Hear my song. Cock-a-doodle-doo!
I'm a hen. I lay eggs that you can eat.
Four voles.
-Who are you? -I'm a unicorn.
Isn't it too much?
Aren't there too many of us?
We could remove one.
Look after the animals, nature, and each other.
-Can you hold this? -Yes.
-And mine too? -Yes.
-Do you have Leo's jacket? -I have the jacket, but no teddy.
-Hi, Christine! How are you? -Hi, nice to see you.
How are you? Hello!
You know. How are you?
We?
Well, no… Oh, you mean…
We're good.
Divorced, happy, good.
Nice to be here.
I was looking for my little cutie, so I'll…
-Go ahead. -I'll see you.
-Yeah. -Or…
Seriously.
The neighbor?
Yeah, but it was…
-It was comfortable, okay? -Right.
Dad, we made a cake. Can you have cake with us?
Yes, honey…
Please, Daddy?
Come on, Dad.
You'd better ask Mom if it's okay.
Please, Mommy. You'd be the best Mommy in the world.
-Please, Mommy? -I don't have anything in the fridge.
Can't Daddy have cake with us?
We're having leftovers…
But if you're okay with having cake for dinner…
You have nothing in the fridge?
No.
I'm trying to relax all the "musts."
Yes.
Ben's coming.
I see.
So if you want to bring Christine,
then do.
That's okay.
-Okay, let's do that. Cake for dinner. -Yes!
Yes, it's confusing,
but the architecture of the brain
can give us clues to our relationship problems,
through three inter-related brain systems,
that have evolved for pairing, reproduction and parenting.
-Shall we crush the perfection? -Yes!
Yes.
But these systems aren't always directly connected.
It's possible to love a person,
be in love with somebody else,
and sexually attracted to a third,
all at the same time.
It might be a neurological explanation
for why Augustinian relationship norms,
don't work for everybody.
But despite all our differences,
we still judge ourselves by old norms and standards,
maybe in an attempt to find some order in the chaos of love.
That way, we can both have our cake and eat it.
-What are you doing to our pet? -I'm doing this.
What are you doing?
I don't understand why we can't live together, all of us.
I need a place of my own too, just like you kids have your own rooms.
But we grown-ups don't have that, right?
Yes, but I think that it's much better like this,
because I hate moving back and forth.
Well, they were the ones who broke up,
so it's only fair that they move back and forth, right?
But I still like having two homes.
Do you think they'll get back together again,
like normal parents?
But Leo,
this is normal too.
I mean, half of your classmates have parents who are divorced.
They just don't talk about it.
And, well,
I think they're together sometimes.
I mean, physically.
But Ben and Christine,
doesn't that make them sad?
No, before Ben and Christine got involved with them, I think.
But I don't know.
Up on the roof? It's too dangerous. Come down.
Okay, my little monkeys…
What are you giggling about?
Grown-ups, you're the monkeys.
Are we? Okay, yes.
That's probably right, but now we're going to go in and be frogs.
Okay? Come on.
Let's start. Are you ready?
Let's sing "Little frogs".
The little frogs, the little frogs Are funny to behold
The little frogs, the little frogs Are funny to behold
No ears to be seen there And tails are missing too
No ears to be seen there And tails are missing too
Cro-ac-ac-ac, cro-ac-ac-ac Croac-ac-ac-aca
So the question is…
Are we humans biological creatures
who live according to our pre-programmed genes,
or does free will regulate everything
when we make detours from the monogamous norm?
Yes.
No, or yes,
or maybe both.
We are both biological and intellectual creatures,
imprinted by everything, from religion to heredity and environment.
Regardless of sexual, religious, and political orientation,
we humans are, after all,
a fantastic mix of biology and intellect.
And that is just human.
But the question remains:
How do you want to live your life?
That was all we had this week.
Next week in Late Night Diorama,
we'll keep examining human behavior
from different perspectives.
Next time, we will examine violence.
Is violence biological or taught?
What's keeping them? The train will leave any minute now.
-I'll go and look for them. -I'll join you, we do everything together.
-Noor. -What?
Jules, Grandpa. Where were you? The train is leaving soon.
Bad start, Noël. And the holiday hasn't even started yet.
-We're going skiing, we're going skiing. -Hey, how old are you, really?
-I'm ten years old. -More like five.
Jules, Noor, stay here. Where did Jet go?
At platform 1, the 11:34 Dingie Ski-Express to Inssbruck will depart…
That's our train. Jules, Noor, we're leaving, let's go.
-Alright. -Come one. Watch out.
So guys, finally we're all going on holiday together.
Very nice.
Really so nice. Just amazing.
Jet?
Do you have it?
Beautiful.
-Is it a good idea? -Of course, it's an amazing idea.
Isn't it too soon? For the kids?
The kids also think it's amazing, you told me yourself.
And this skiing holiday is the perfect opportunity.
That's why we're going on this holiday.
The only thing we need to do now, is to find the perfect moment to propose.
And I've brought everything I might need.
I just fell in the snow, head first. Only thing you could see, were my ski's.
-Do you think that's funny? -Yes.
Okay Felix, focus. This is your schedule for today.
If you ever want to be a champion skier, you'll have to train really hard.
We'll start with…
You don't have time for that. I told you to focus.
Your training is all that's important. Winning is the only thing that matters.
You want that, right? Just like your dad.
Yeah…
We start in the morning with 20 minutes runs, and after that…
-Are you going skiing? -Me? On those little slats?
Never in my life.
I am. I'm going to be the best skier ever. I don't think so.
You bet I will.
-Yeah? -Yes.
Okay.
-First put on your PJ's. -No, I'm not going to sleep.
If you want to become the best skier ever, you need to be well-rested.
-Go on. -Alright then.
-But I'm taking the top bunk. -No way.
Yes, I am.
Five years old, really.
Jules, Jules. Later, in my cabin?
-Okay, once Noor is asleep. -Make sure no one sees you.
Okay.
Noor?
-Hey, Grandpa. -Hey, Jules.
-Is Noor asleep? -Like a baby.
-Time for the presents. -Jules, wait. Sit down.
Son, if we use our magic snow globe to go to the North Pole right now
to get the Christmas present for the kids and bring them round
and then want to go back, we won't come back here.
We'll come back to my home, at my shop in Belgium.
While your mother, Noortje and the others are in a hotel in…
-In Austria. -Yes.
We need to wait for now.
We need to wait until we have a room in the hotel and then we can…
-Reset the home button of the snow globe. -Exactly.
In the meantime, we should come up with a plan to stay away from the hotel
without anyone noticing.
What was that?
-What's all this stuff you brought along? -Just some nice scarfs.
-Nice scarfs? -Yes. You never know.
It's definitely going to snow,
but it could also be suddenly become really hot.
You never know.
-There you go. -Thank you.
So, did I tell you the truth, or not?
Ella.
-Hello. -Hi.
-What do you think? -I'd wouldn't mind working here as well.
Maybe in about ten years or so.
-Shall I show you the rooms? -Yes.
-Guys, are you coming? -This way.
Yes, I'm the first one.
Very nice.
There you go.
Jef and Suzanne's room.
Jet's room. I'll see you later as well.
-Are you okay? -Yes, yes.
-Can you get into every room? -That's the advantage of my job.
-There, Noor and Jules' room. -Wow.
-We're sharing a room. -Yes.
-And here's Noël's room. -I'll give you a hand.
No, that's not necessary. You go and explore our room.
-So you can pick the best bed, little one. -I'm not little.
Of course not.
Alone at last. I'll reset the snow globe.
Wait a minute.
What's this?
What?
I definitely heard something.
I don't hear anything.
I think you should get your ears checked, Grandpa.
-Ouch, you're sitting on my hair. -I can't see a thing.
-You're on my hair. -I'm sorry.
A little bit of light would…
Holger…
-Her idea. -Yeah.
But the gifts station is in good hands, Mr. Claus.
-Yes? In which hands? -Well, Ikka.
And Joel.
Joel?
-A teddy bear for Fleur. -What? A teddy bear?
No way, that's old news. Girls don't want teddy bears, they want dolls.
She'll just get a doll.
I WOULD LIKE A LEGO FIRE STATION
A fire station for Alejandra? Who makes this stuff up?
I'll tell you exactly what girls want.
Girls want a unicorn with long lashes, extensions and…
purple lip gloss. Girls go crazy over purple lip gloss.
And why couldn't a girl play with a fire station?
And why couldn't a girl play with a fire station? Girls can like that too. What you're saying is ridiculous.
Girls can like that too. What you're saying is ridiculous. Mr. Tough Guy.
-Don't fire us. -Mr. Claus would never do that. Right?
Right, Mr. Claus?
This is perfect for our honeymoon.
Is this our bed?
Are the springs broken?
-Ella. -Hi.
I forgot my cuddly toy in Grandpa's room.
Could I get the key to go get it?
-I can't do that, I'm sorry. -But I miss him so much.
-And Grandpa wouldn't mind. -I'll go with you.
-And Grandpa wouldn't mind. -I'll go with you. You don't have to, you're already so busy.
You don't want to get fired, right?
Quickly, then.
Bath beads.
And rose-scented foam. And bath bombs.
What's wrong with a simple bar of soap?
-Do you think it's the maid? -Oh, sweetheart…
Or a thief.
Holgie, it could be a murderer.
And I haven't tried the jacuzzi and breakfast in bed and a massage yet.
Will it hurt?
Is that the snow globe?
-Just breathe, sweetheart. -Breathe…
-Grandpa? -Noor?
Who are you?
I sometimes ask myself the same question.
And what is this?
Is Grandpa Santa Claus?
After me, of course.
What?
Cool. So you are little Christmas elves?
So we're on the North Pole with all the presents, right?
-Correct. -Correct.
And correct again.
Does your grandpa know you're here?
I wouldn't…
No, wait.
Noor, don't.
-Mr. Claus won't like this. -No.
-Joel, do something. -Who, me?
-Look at how big she is. -Can't you…
Gunna, Holger?
Grandpa forgot his wallet and we need to rent skies, so…
Jules?
-It's a disaster. -What's a disaster?
-Noor is in the cabin. -What?
-Exactly that. -Yeah.
Jules? What are you doing here?
I should ask you the same thing.
How did you get this? You're not supposed to know.
-Why not? You know too. -That's different.
-Why? It's not fair. -I'm Santa Claus, okay?
You? Santa Claus? But what about Grandpa?
-Grandpa too. We do it together. -Can I be Santa Claus as well?
No, of course not.
-Why not? -You're way too little.
-Little? I'm ten. -More like five.
-That's not true. -No, little one?
"We're going skiing, we're going skiing."
I don't think so.
If you want to conquer those mountains, you need a good breakfast, little one.
-I'm not little. -Noor, it was just a joke.
Not a morning person, just like someone else I know.
-Look who's talking. -Me?
Almost just as beautiful as the North Pole.
Jules? Is something wrong?
Nothing I can't handle.
Wanna race?
-Yeah. -Wait.
I won. Silly, right?
So? Delivered all the presents?
So you didn't think to tell me
that your sister discovered the secret Christmas world?
Jules?
-I just wanted to take care of it. -That's exactly what I mean.
I'm still here, I could help you.
I thought you'd say that she could join us.
And I don't want that. I'm Santa Claus.
Waiter, can I get some more spiced wine?
Thank you.
Listen, Christmas is the most important thing.
Dad thought so too. And you said it yourself.
I just want to make him proud.
Your dad was Santa Claus. The bonified Santa Claus.
But he was also your dad and Noor's dad and your mother's pride and joy.
For him, you, your mother and your sister were the most important in the world.
And he wouldn't want you to exclude your sister.
It already happened.
So you'll have to work together. And remember, it's not a competition.
What if she tells everyone? Then the Christmas world will be in danger.
Your sister is more capable than you think.
Okay.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Do you call this skiing? On this hill for babies?
Be careful not to fall, baby.
Whoops, is your family not here to hold your hand?
I can do it alone.
So I'll have to go to the North Pole without you tonight?
The North Pole?
-Do you want to play a game? -I'm going to bed. Skiing is tiring.
Sleep tight.
Okay. Jules, Grandpa?
I'd like to, but I think I'll hit the hay a bit earlier tonight.
Noor is right. I'm going to bed too. Sleep tight.
Good night.
I'd like to play a game.
Come here.
-Did the kids go to bed? -Yes.
Yes, this is the perfect moment for your wedding proposal.
-Have you been drinking, Jet? -No, I haven't.
But they have a jacuzzi here and I've got the perfect bath oil.
Nice and soft, nice smell, very romantic. All you need.
I don't know. I was thinking more like a candlelight dinner.
A candlelight dinner? No, this is way more exiting.
A jacuzzi.
Yeah…
-Did your mom kiss you good night? -Yes.
-Alright. That gives us a few hours. -Us too.
-Jet. -Mom?
Jet.
Bath oil. Bath foam.
I used the wrong bottle.
How could that happen?
Noortje, are you sure you want to do this?
Yes.
I'm really experiencing déjà vu.
Because there's no way back after this.
-Yes? Okay. -Yes.
-Yes? Okay. -Yes. Then I have one golden rule.
You can't tell this secret…
Because this is a secret.
You can never ever tell anyone.
Otherwise Christmas could be in danger.
-Yes? -Yes.
And don't touch anything.
Exactly.
Now there's only one thing left.
There.
Congratulations.
We'll go to the North Pole first to get the presents
and then we'll go to Mexico.
Mexico.
You shouldn't do that to your vocal cords, really. Oh, sweetheart…
-Mexico. Jules, here. -Thanks.
Look…
A Christmas tree. And another one, look.
Oh, cookies.
-Don't touch anything. -Okay.
Except when it's for Santa Claus.
Okay.
I heard something downstairs.
Sorry…
Enrico.
My goodness.
Okay…
Hide.
Who's there?
Good evening.
Good evening. I'm Santa Claus.
Santa.
-You're Santa? -Yes. I'm Santa.
Are you listening, Enrico?
The police, come.
-Police. Come on. -Carmelita, I'll call the police.
No police, no.
Oh no, not the police.
Oh sweetie, yes. A bit more to the left.
Exciting right, a honeymoon?
Just as exciting as typing out toy lists.
Did you say something, Holgie?
Noor, I told you not to touch anything.
-Now it is exciting. -Get out, I don't want to see you anymore.
What happened? Where's Mr. Claus?
Sweetheart, put those cotton pads back on your eyes. I'll do your other foot.
Jules, do you know anything about Grandpa yet?
After your ski lesson, you'll come back here with Jef to have lunch, okay?
Jules, you too.
-I'm going to have lunch with Grandpa. -Me too.
Okay. So where is Grandpa? I haven't seen him all morning.
He's on his way. He wanted to sleep in.
-And is Jet not coming? -No, she has a headache.
Good morning, Hotel Schnee Halm.
Yes.
Jules, Grandpa Noël for you.
-Grandpa? From his room? -Room service?
-Grandpa, where are you? -In some prison in Mexico.
I don't know where exactly. But Jules, listen.
This is the only call I am allowed to make.
Don't worry about me, I'll be okay.
But you need to take care of Christmas.
The presents and everything.
And do it with your sister, Jules.
-Okay? -Yes.
Are we going outside? It's so hot here.
-Finally. -Yes, come.
Give me your cell phone number.
-Dude, seriously? -Yes, zero, four,
-five, seven… -Eight.
Enough. Your call is now over.
Thank you.
Grandpa?
Grandpa, where are you?
Alright, Noor. Ready for the next step? It's actually very simple.
Stick your bum out and just sit down.
But I'm very scared of heights.
What's wrong? Are you afraid of the ski lift, baby?
Calm down, boy. You should help her instead of making fun of her.
As far as I know, people who help others don't win.
And Felix is a winner.
Come on, Felix.
I'm gonna see where Jules is.
I'm never drinking spiced wine again.
Here you go.
I thought this vacation would be different.
What do you mean?
I don't know. I thought we'd be together more.
I haven't seen Jules this morning and I've barely seen Noor.
And they only want to have lunch with Grandpa today.
Little children grow up. Just let them.
They'll come find you when they need you.
You do know what that means, right?
You have enough time to focus on Jef and to propose to him.
Yeah, like yesterday, right?
Just think of yesterday as a rehearsal.
But this time it's for real and I know exactly what we'll do.
"We?"
-Jules? -What?
-Do you know where Grandpa is yet? -No.
-I'll help you look for him. -I'll do it by myself.
I have no time to babysit you.
Was that really necessary?
Mr. Claus would want you to work together, really.
Grandpa isn't here right now, is he?
Okay, guys. Let's look up prisons in Mexico.
I need to find Grandpa.
Just a nice, hot sauna.
Where are you going?
We don't all have to look at that screen together, right?
-And Mr. Claus said he was fine, right? -Yes.
And apparently the spa is amazing here.
I also want to go to the spa.
Are you crying again? You really are a baby.
Stop calling me that. It's not true, I'm not a baby.
Okay, prove it.
On the top of that mountain is an old cabin. I'll race you.
Okay.
But how? You're afraid of the ski lift.
You'll see.
Do you happen to know the coordinates for the mountain?
-Why do you need to know? -Homework.
We're learning about it at school
and need to write down the coordinates of our holiday destination.
I do have some maps here.
Hold on.
Yes.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
Are you sure you wouldn't rather have stayed in the valley?
It's all for the good cause.
There. I think that's the perfect spot, there.
Just look at that snow and the fog.
So romantic. Just like in a Christmas movie.
Jef is coming.
-What if he says no? -He won't.
-How can you know for sure? -I'm a good judge of character.
Look, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
That's true. And I've brought something
which would melt the heart of a lot of people.
Just open that.
-Chocolates? -Yes, but not just any chocolates.
This is a box full of love.
Okay, I'll go before Jef gets here.
-No, I have to pee first. -Here?
Yeah, it's so fun to pee outdoors.
Jet?
-How will I ever find Grandpa like this? -There goes our honeymoon.
Excuse me?
It's awful. For Grandpa.
-And our honeymoon. -Yes.
Yes, there. You need to scroll down.
He doesn't need to scroll down. Let him do it.
And later we'll just…
-We're taking a break. -We're going to the spa.
To the spa.
Who put bath foam in the jacuzzi?
-Every day? -Yes.
We're doing this every day.
And we'll keep practicing until we can't anymore.
Yes, I've beaten them here.
Just because my dad can do it, doesn't mean I can.
You just need to try it once, you'll be fine.
Jet?
Come on.
-Hey, buddy. -I don't want to anymore.
I want to go home, to my parents and my brother.
Felix, I know it's lonely at the top, but tomorrow's qualification is important.
-You need to win to become champion. -I don't need to do anything.
You do and you know it.
Let's go. Down the hill three times, in less than ten minutes.
I just want to go home.
What? How did you get here?
This could help you.
A snow globe? How can that help me?
Are you making fun of me?
Are you too afraid to try it or something? Baby.
Why are you doing this?
Why not?
Okay, good. Do you happen to know your home's coordinates?
Come.
Here, sit down.
I think a candlelight lunch inside is much better.
-Now? -Yes, the kids are with Grandpa.
-A candlelight lunch? Can I join you? -Definitely.
-Nice, with the three of us. -The three of us?
No, candlelight meals are always with only two people.
Just the two of us.
-Where are you going? -To have lunch.
Like that? You're not going like that, are you?
You, go to you room and freshen up a bit.
And you come with me.
You need to make a little efoort for a candlelight lunch.
Turn around and let me see.
What was that?
Animals, over there.
Animals?
Oh… Sorry sweetie, but…
This is not what you think. It's just…
There were little people over there.
Little people?
I didn't expect this from you.
But Jet, I really am innocent.
-Jules? -Grandpa?
Jules, I managed to get a phone,
but I still haven't spoken to a lawyer.
Mr. Claus in jail?
I think it might be time for you to come and get me with the snow globe.
Do you have more details for me?
Details? Yes, well…
I can hear water.
And I can also hear seagulls.
-I can see light. -Seagulls and light? We need more.
Flashing light. I can't really explain it.
Such a bummer that Mr. Claus doesn't know what the flashing light is.
Okay, it's near a light, but we first need to know what light that is.
-Hey, shouldn't you be skiing? -Hold on.
Grandpa, does the light flash horizontally or vertically?
Okay, do you know something that lights up like this?
A flashlight? A siren…
-A lighthouse? -Yes, that's it.
-Thank you. -What are you doing?
Something for school.
You as well?
Come get me, quickly.
I have to go, Jules.
It worked.
-What did he say? -That Felix wants to quit his training.
Can you imagine that? I never quit. Training, training, training.
That's all I did. No fun trips, no friends, nothing.
And what does he do? He just complains all the time.
Honey, don't be so hard on him. He's still young.
I was also young. And if he doesn't win, he's no longer my son.
-I want to go back. -No…
Felix, wait.
Noor, did you do what I think you did?
I just wanted to help.
I found the solution.
Holgie, tell him.
-Jules… -That light flash is a lighthouse.
How many prisons will be near a lighthouse?
Just tell him.
There, just one.
-Jules… -Where is the snow globe?
Right…
-Where's the snow globe? -Very good question.
You need to give it back, it's not mine.
I'm going to use it to win the qualifications.
-If I use it to get down, I'm way quicker. -That's cheating.
Don't care, at least I'll have qualified.
What if they see you? The snow globe is a secret and it'll get me into trouble.
-I'll make sure they won't see me. -I thought we were friends.
I don't need friends.
What is going on here?
You again? Don't you have any manners?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself, Felix? Is this discipline?
We'll go and get your stuff. Three times up and down the mountain.
And you stay here.
-Noor exposed the Christmas world? -I told you not to exclude her.
Yeah, that was definitely said.
I was right not to trust her.
There's one golden rule. Never talk about the Christmas world and she did.
Yes, but…
-Jules. -Grandpa.
Jules, hurry up.
-Grandpa? -Calm.
Grandpa?
Are you still there? Grandpa?
Come, come on then.
Grandpa, are you okay?
Come on,
Grandpa?
I need to find the snow globe.
And Noor.
Yeah, well…
-Noor? -Is this your sister?
-Yes. -Keep your eye on her from now on.
-Where's the snow globe? -With Felix.
And where's Felix?
Noor, what did you do? Christmas is the most important thing.
-You've betrayed that. -Oh no, Jules. No.
And Grandpa. Because of you we can't get him back.
He may even be dead already.
Noor.
Noor, what are you going to do?
I'm saving Grandpa.
You shouldn't do it by yourself. Wait.
-Are we almost there? -No idea.
And? Noor?
Does he have it? What are we going to do?
-I have an idea. -Okay.
Help, help.
Let me out of here. Help.
He's in the closet.
-Shouldn't you do this with Jules? -No.
It's my fault Grandpa is in trouble.
So I need to fix it myself.
-This is not the prison. -I'm afraid of heights.
Oh, no.
The snow globe.
No. Noor, stay there and hold tight.
Don't move. Stay put, Noor.
No, hold on tight. Don't do it.
Oh, no. Stay calm. Okay.
Grab my hand.
Grab it.
I need the snow globe.
-For Grandpa. -I know.
Okay. Hold on, Noor. Okay.
Okay. Remain calm.
Come on, you can do it.
-Grandpa? -Jules, I'm okay.
Grandpa.
Gunna, Grandpa is still alive. -Noor.
-What did she do now? -Together…
Lighthouse… Oh no, we can't.
-Gunna, calm down. -Afraid of heights.
-Grab my hand, but it's too small. -Gunna.
Gunna, calm down. Tell me what happened.
Noor wanted to get Grandpa with the snow globe,
but we landed on the lighthouse and then she fell.
-Help. -Noor, give me your hand.
Come on.
Jules, I'm sorry.
No, I'm the one that should say sorry.
I shouldn't have excluded you.
From now on, you can be Santa too.
-But together, not by myself. -Together, with Grandpa and with me.
I'm sorry.
-Shall we go and get him? -Yes.
Nice, right?
We deserved this.
How do you think Mr. Claus is doing?
He's a big boy, he'll be fine.
I'm sure he's less hot than us. Right now.
Completely insane. Santa Claus.
Santa Claus?
Hello? Santa?
Is Grandpa in that cell? Yes.
-But we have to stay undetected, okay? -Okay.
How will we ever get Grandpa out of here?
I have a plan,
but we first need to go to the North Pole quickly.
-Do you have the snow globe? -Yes.
Okay, great.
Okay, let's go. Go ahead.
Ready?
-Ready. -Okay.
Go.
Silence. Shut up.
-Grandpa. -Jules.
-Noor. -Where's the key?
-In the top drawer. -Go, get it.
I knew it. I knew you would come and get me.
-Come here. -Grandpa.
-I knew it. -Guards.
Shake it.
Santa?
We're going on a honeymoon, she said. Nice and relaxing, she said.
No problem whatsoever, she said.
-What's keeping them? -And what do you call that?
Well, I call that a fluffy hurricane.
Well, I call that a fluffy hurricane. Yes, fireworks with flower petals. Sugar on strawberries…
Mr. Claus, they saved you. Finally.
We were incredibly worried.
And you've retrieved the snowglobe. Just in time to deliver the presents.
Felix. Felix is still up there.
Not by yourself.
Wait for me.
-Felix, are you alright? -You.
You locked me in here.
-Felix. -Don't.
-Don't do it. -Don't.
-Don't do it, boy. -Felix.
Wait.
Help.
-Help. -Felix.
Help.
-Felix, give me your hand. -The snow globe, I can almost reach it.
-Felix, don't. -I need it to make the qualification.
-Otherwise I'll never win. -Not important, we need to work together.
You're way more important than that stupid qualification.
Give me your hand.
I can't hold on.
I told you we would do everything together from now on.
-Grandpa. -Noor.
Thank God.
Noël, come.
Come here.
Jezus, Noël, the storm. Where were you?
-We were hiding in a cabin. -They have a jacket just like Santa.
Noël, you'll never do this to me again. From now on, the kids have lunch with me.
They're back. Yes, luckily. Goodbye.
-Come. -Just a second, mommy.
I'm sorry, Grandpa. I should've never let Felix see the snow globe.
Now it's gone and you can never go back to the North Pole.
And no one will get presents anymore.
Jules was right, I would be the worst Santa ever.
Why did you show Felix the snow globe?
He wanted to see his parents and he was all alone.
I just wanted to help him.
Someone who always teased you?
And that's exactly why you're the best Santa ever.
Go to your mother now, she missed you.
Jef said he's really sorry.
For whatever he did.
Maybe I overreacted a bit.
You think so?
What's wrong?
I don't know.
I can't get the marriage proposal together.
And it seems like you two don't want to be here with us.
Maybe it's too soon and we should just leave it as it is.
No, no. Noor and I just had a little fight.
-Really? -Yes.
It's already been resolved. Who can stay angry at such a little one?
I'm not little.
Five years old, really.
Why don't you propose to Jef tonight, at dinner?
When everyone's there.
Is that what you want?
Yes.
Dad would also like it if we were a family again.
-I can't find the ring. -What?
-How can that be? -No idea, I had it in the train.
Okay, no problem. You can do without. -No, but…
It'll be fine. Just ask him.
What's that?
Yeah, otherwise it would never happen.
Yes.
Really?
Of course. Wait.
No.
No, I mean, yes. Yes.
-Your food will get cold. -Yeah.
Hey, Noor.
Are you going up the mountain by yourself tomorrow?
And then smooth skiing to the bottom?
I don't know if I can do that.
You know what I think? I think you can do more than you think.
-Sleep tight. -You too.
Okay Felix, watch out for that turn.
And you see that one? You need to…
Hey, focus.
-Come on, Noor. -No, wait.
Come on, you can do it.
Jef is right, you can do it.
Are you insane? It's almost your turn to qualify.
Sometimes it's not about winning, but about working together with your friends.
Together?
Together.
Felix.
Alright, Felix.
Now you're a real winner.
Sorry, Grandpa. I messed up.
That's weird.
-Noor said the exact same thing. -What?
No, that's not true. I excluded her.
That's why she went to Felix.
All because I wanted to do it by myself.
Now what? Without a snow globe we can't deliver packages.
Yes… No…
But…
How?
-We need to leave right away. -We?
Aren't you forgetting someone?
-Noor. -I have to go to my brother.
And… thank you.
And don't tell Felix this time.
[Oprah] How you feeling?
[Viola] I'm nervous.
[Oprah] Don't be nervous.
I just saw your little picture and I wanted to start boohooing.
So here we are on my porch in Maui.
[sighing] Maui. Thank you for being here in our happy place.
-Oh, thank you for having me. -Thank you for joining me.
I know we've known each other for a number of years.
We've had other interviews, but I have to tell you
when I read this book…
something happened inside me.
I… I thought, "Wow!"
What a wonder.
What, um… what… what an incredible life
that you have manifested for yourself,
that you have used the strength,
that you have used the power that I don't even know where you got it.
When I finished the, not even the first chapter,
when I finished the first paragraph, 'cause you know how you open a book…
Yeah. [laughing]
…with the first words.
I was calling everybody I know to say
we must choose this as a book club
to have as many people in the world read it as possible.
What was it about this time
that you were ready to expose this level of truth about yourself?
That is my most frightening question.
Could I say that, Oprah?
I believed that I was having a bad existential crisis.
That's what I believe.
Um, I wrote the… really wrote the book during the pandemic.
But existential crisis, meaning that crisis of meaning.
-What's my meaning? -Uh-huh.
How do I connect to the world feeling very disconnected, very isolated.
And was it the pandemic that had made you feel that way?
-I think the pandemic, um, exacerbated it. -[Oprah] Exacerbated it. Yeah.
I think before that time,
what's happened with me over the last probably 12, 13 years
is the ascension to a level of fame.
-I think it's safe to say. -[Oprah] Mm-hmm.
[Viola] And the feeling that once I hit it and once I got on top,
that somehow my life was going to open up.
All of a sudden,
it would be some sort of feeling
where, uh… that I have arrived,
that I know the meaning of my life,
and the heavens were gonna open up,
and God was gonna sing,
and that's it.
[Oprah] Shrewd.
-Where's my Coke? -"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" boys.
Where's my Coke? I need a Coke. Hot as it is. Shoot.
[Oprah] Vulnerable.
-Throw the priest out then. -[woman] I am trying to do just that.
Then what do you want from me?
[Oprah] Fierce.
I gave 18 years of my life to stand in the same spot as you!
[Oprah] These are just a few of the portraits in Viola Davis' collection
of astonishing portrayals.
They don't care nothin' about me.
All they want
is my voice.
[Oprah] One win and four nominations
makes Viola the most celebrated black actress in Oscar history.
I became an artist, and thank God I did,
because we are the only profession
that celebrates what it means to live a life.
[Oprah] Her Emmy-winning turn as Annalise Keating
in Shonda Rhimes' How to Get Away with Murder…
That's what it costs to change the world.
[Oprah] …is a role Viola describes as powerful, liberating, and life-changing.
So who wants in?
[Oprah] Viola's first love, the theater,
has awarded her two Tonys,
both for plays by the legendary playwright August Wilson.
I was born into a certain circumstance where I couldn't see it with my eyes,
I couldn't touch it with my hands,
and so I had to believe it in my heart.
And I would live the rest of my life in joy and peace…
…and, um, sort of like, uh, Cinderella…
[chuckling] …when Prince Charming comes in, and that didn't happen.
What happened was excitement at first
and then the feeling of exhaustion,
the feeling of really, um… um, impostors in my life
in terms of friendships,
people overstepping their boundaries,
people feeling like I was a commodity.
Um, pressure.
The pressure of unseen responsibility.
All I know is it wasn't it.
Then the question is, "So, Viola, what is it?"
[Viola] What is it?
What's home to you?
And how do you get at it?
And I didn't know the answer to that.
The only thing I could think to do was to go back to the beginning of my story
was to go back to the beginning of my story
because I think that once you tell your story over and over again,
you start to hear it,
and you start to think, "Okay. How did I get here?"
And what it does,
what it emphasizes is you go back to the purest form of Viola.
[Oprah] Wow, I know--
And you find out, she helps you define
what it is that you would call home.
You go back to this.
-[Viola] Yeah. -You go back to this.
Yeah.
I mean, that's how I knew in the first paragraph,
this is a book that everyone should read.
Well, I knew, like anything,
that when you start a book is it's sort of like a salutation.
-[Oprah] Yes. Yes. -And you say, "Hi. How are you?"
-You know? So… -[Oprah chuckling]
-So you did. -[Viola] I did. I had to introduce me.
And me is always that little girl, eight years-old, third grade,
who would wait at the back door during dismissal.
And as soon as that bell rang,
I just ran over people.
I was pretty tough.
I ran over everyone so I can run home
because I knew the same eight to nine boys were going to be chasing me,
calling me Black, ugly nigger,
and they would pick up anything they could find on the side of the road,
bricks, sticks, anything.
And the vitriol that would be thrown at me.
Um, and the level of hatred
when they were saying those words of Black, ugly nigger.
And, um… and I would run, run, run, run, run.
-And I would chuck the finger. [chuckling] -[Oprah] Mm-hmm.
I would say all the cuss words
and, um…
But that really is the memory that defined me.
Because what I always say is that I thought I was really, really slick.
I was tough, brought a crocheting needle to school.
Threatened them at one point, got them to stop running after me,
but I always say
that I never stopped running.
My feet just stopped moving.
Wow.
But as I went through my life,
as much as I tried to put on that mask of bravery,
of confidence,
of being that sort of boss woman that people talk about,
of you don't let anyone see you, uh, sweat.
You know, if you wanna climb the ladder,
you gotta believe in yourself, girl.
So I put all the language and the mask of that on,
but inside, absolutely, was the damaged little girl
that I left in Central Falls
who really, really believed that she was ugly.
That she was
not enough.
That's what defined me more than anything else.
-I wish it were a different story. I do. -[Oprah] Mm-hmm.
But it was so powerful,
and you know with girls--
Do you wish it now was a different story, or are you like…
Maya used to say, "I wouldn't take nothing from my journey now."
Are you now at a stage where,
because of that little girl
and because of the terrorization that you experienced on all levels,
and because of the terrorization that you experienced on all levels, that you recognized that's why you are who you are?
Yes. I do.
I do recognize it.
Yeah. That without that, there wouldn't be this.
Absolutely.
I… I do recognize it.
I do believe that your life is sort of a dying of self.
I do. In… in the same way that a phoenix rises out of the ashes, right?
And I do believe that it's a part of your journey and finding yourself
And I do believe that it's a part of your journey and finding yourself is going to these caves of trauma and vitriol
and all of those things.
And somehow in the midst of that, it's like Joseph Campbell says,
as you go down this path of transformation
of really trying to become your ideal self…
Right. …you're gonna meet the part of yourself that you don't wanna be.
You're gonna see all of your flaws.
You're gonna see all the things that cause you pain.
You're not gonna see God,
you're gonna see you.
And then you hope that… [chuckling]
…I think that I have it in the first paragraph,
that, you know, when you meet that self that you no longer wanna be,
you have two choices at that point.
You can just stay there
and be swallowed,
or you can move on.
I choose to move on.
I didn't want to be swallowed,
and I made that decision at 28, 29 when I went into therapy
that I wanted to be different.
Tell me about your parents, Dan and May Alice.
-Not Mary Alice. Not Mary. -Dan and May Alice. Not Mary Alice.
I love, love, love, love my parents.
-[Oprah] My daddy and mama, you call 'em? -[Viola] Yeah, my mama and daddy. I loved.
[Oprah] During her childhood, Viola describes her father, Dan Davis,
as strict and violent, but also the first man who loved me.
Viola writes that her father, because of his circumstances,
had a 5th-grade education
and ran away from an abusive home at age 15.
He worked most of his life as a horse groomer.
Viola calls her mother, May Alice, loyal,
a self-sacrificer, and a maternal warrior.
May Alice was raised on a plantation in South Carolina
and gave birth to Viola there.
Her mother worked in factories and as a maid,
and fought for welfare reform in the 1970s.
Viola's parents were challenged by racism, poverty, addiction, and abuse,
but stayed married for 48 years until Dan Davis's death at age 70.
They raised Viola and her five siblings together in Central Falls, Rhode Island.
But it was just a life of abject poverty.
It was a life of deprivation.
That… that's what it was. A life of deprivation.
-[Oprah] Yeah. -No food…
I thought I grew up poor, Viola, until I read your story.
-[Viola laughing] Yeah. Po'. -So I will now say, "Hello."
-Po'. -"I bow to po'." Okay?
-[laughing] -I grew up poor.
I was not po'.
You… you were-- And you know what how people say… many people say, "I grew up poor and I didn't know it"?
You all knew it.
Yep. Absolutely.
-I say we knew we were po'. -[Oprah] Yeah.
[Viola] You know, the plaster coming off the walls,
and, um, always being hungry.
-This is not fun-- -[Oprah] In cold Rhode Island.
[Viola] Freezing, plumbing never working.
You know, you had to fill the bucket of water to put in the toilet to flush it.
Never having a phone. Never having a phone.
And, um, wetting the bed.
-I was a serious bed-wetter. -[Oprah] Hmm.
Most of the furniture… We… we got some furniture on the side of the road.
Most of the furniture from Salvation Army.
-Um… -You were a bed-wetter until you were 14. [Viola] Fourteen.
An apartment, one of our first apartments,
infested with rats.
An infestation.
I mean, at night you had to put your hands over your ears,
so you couldn't hear them eating the pigeons on the roof at night.
And… and listening to them eat your toys at night
and jump on top of you in the bed.
This is the line that got me. I'm gonna stop with the jump…
I wanna interrupt the "jump on top of me in bed," 'cause just the thought of that…
But this is what got me.
And I… I remember so vividly thinking, I've read a lot of novels,
a lot of… a lot of memoirs, a lot of history.
I mean, not even Pecola Breedlove in The Bluest Eye.
Pecola Breedlove is pretty hard.
[Oprah] Pretty hard, but not even Pecola Breedlove had--
"There were several fires and the building soon became infested with rats."
"In fact, the rats were so bad, they ate the faces off my dolls."
"I never, ever went into the kitchen."
"Rats had taken over the cabinets and the counter."
"The plaster was constantly falling off the wall,
revealing the wooden boards holding the house together."
I remember growing up in a flat, you know, on welfare with my mother
too afraid to go into the kitchen at night
'cause they would come out from behind the refrigerator and the cabinets.
-[Viola] Yes. -Yes.
Absolutely. And then my sister, uh, Diane, um… [chuckling]
She was reading stories of rats eating babies in Harlem in the cribs.
So then… then she told it to us,
and then we felt like we had to wrap, um, coats or shirts around our necks at night
to keep the rats from biting our necks.
And, um… and we would listen to them--
And they would jump on the bed.
They would jump on the bed and eating the… [scoffing]
'Cause I had a doll that had… what, um… was made of hard plastic.
-So like porcelain. -[Oprah] Yeah. I had one doll like that.
-And to hear the eating of that doll. -[Oprah sucking teeth]
-[Viola] I mean loud. The crunching. -[shuddering]
And then when I woke up, the entire face was gone.
-Ugh. -Yeah. [Oprah] There was a shocking point in the book,
where you were talking about the violence in your home.
And there was a seminal moment
when your father was beating on your mother,
and you tried to stand between them.
And he had taken a glass and had cut her in the face.
-[Viola] Yeah. -Describe that moment.
Put us in the story.
Yes. It was a particularly violent fight when my father said,
Yes. It was a particularly violent fight when my father said, "I'm gonna… I'm gonna bust your head open May Alice."
And I had my baby sister in my hand,
and, um, I was so terrified.
It just got really heated, and he finally… he smashed her head with the… with the glass.
-[Oprah] Oh. -And the blood came spurting out.
And by that point, my fear, um…
And by that point, my fear, um… my fear had… had taken over,
and I just remember screaming, "Stop it!"
"Just stop!"
"Give me the glass!"
And I can't tell you, it's sort of like, um…
I don't know, coming face-to-face with a giant.
Coming face-to-face with your fear.
This is my father.
And, first of all, you never told Dan Davis what to do.
-[Oprah] Right. -'Cause…
-Also-- -…I was terrified.
We grew up in the… in the era where you don't talk back to your parents anyway.
-At all. -At all.
So here I was doing the unnatural thing,
which is telling a parent to stop doing something
that he should not have been doing.
And I can't tell you that… how much it cost me something
to step outside and this--
Everybody,
especially at 14…
[sighing] …you need a parent.
[Oprah] Yes. Yes.
You need a guide. That person with, sort of, that lamp.
-Right. -[Viola] That proverbial lamp. That's gonna take you down darkened paths,
and gonna teach you something about navigating life,
even though, you know, you're still gonna face some crap in life. Yeah.
But someone to show you how to do what they did.
Yeah. You're not supposed to be showing them.
-No. Not at all. -[Oprah] Yes. Yeah.
And for me, it cost me something
to tell a parent to don't do that.
You're gonna kill my mom.
I… I wasn't… I did not have the emotional maturity,
an… an… an engine to be able to do that.
But I found myself doing it anyway.
But the surprise of that now, and I think I wrote it in the book, is that I had it in me.
and I think I wrote it in the book, is that I had it in me. [Oprah] Yeah.
I had a different sorta strength in me that maybe I couldn't see at the time…
-That's what you wrote. -…but was ever-present.
And that moment actually caused a shift in you
to realize that you did have it in you.
[Viola] Yeah. I think, uh, it did.
-Like after that, a lot of things changed. -[Oprah] Yeah.
[Viola] Fourteen was the age I decided I was gonna be an actress.
Fourteen was the age that I won a major art contest,
and I thought I was Slick Willie for doing that.
Fourteen was the age that I realized I really wanted out,
and I saw a way out.
A hole had been been blasted through this cave that I was in.
[Oprah] Yeah. I wanna just say to everyone that you eventually forgave your father,
that you eventually forgave your father,
and became very close with him towards the end of his life.
And that you understood as an adult that he was dealing with his own demons
and had come from, you know, such hardship and such tragedy and such--
Literally, you know, not being seen
and… and victimized himself.
Well, they say that that's what successful therapy is.
That when the day comes when you realize
that your parents did the best they could with what they had.
And In the end you realized that he loved you.
How did you know, Viola?
Because he told me and he showed me
every single day.
Even when he would be in the car with me driving,
and I drove into a parking lot,
he would say, "Boy, that's so good, daughter."
"You such a great driver. I love you so much."
He would go to… He went to all of our plays even if they were in New York.
-Was it hard, though, to forgive? -Yeah.
Because I remember when I was… Gayle and I were talking about your book,
and she was saying, "I just don't understand how you can forgive
when a parent has done so much damage."
Was it hard for you to forgive?
-Absolutely it was. -[Oprah] Mm.
It is, and it still is, I would say.
But it's a choice.
You actually use a line in here that I often use for describing,
you know, forgiveness.
That it's giving up hope that the past could've been different. -[Viola] Yeah. -And you use that line in here.
-[Viola] Yeah. -And you use that line in here.
So you had reached that point and recognize that I can't change what it was.
and recognize that I can't change what it was.
-[Viola] Absolutely. -And so I'm just going to march forward.
Yeah. I mean, listen,
uh, y-you know…
At the end of the day, that's what we're all trying to do.
We're all trying to do the best we can with what we've been given.
-And that's it. -[Oprah] Mm-hmm.
We just don't have a face of what that looks like.
I think that sometimes we watch too much TV. [Oprah] Mm-hmm.
And we… we want lives to be played out the same way.
A 41-minute drama is played out on Thursday night lineup--
-And it don't work that way. -[Viola] And it doesn't work that way.
That everything is… becomes a, sort of, extension
That everything is… becomes a, sort of, extension to how much you're willing to accept the life that God gave you…
to how much you're willing to accept the life that God gave you…
and how much bravery you have to forge ahead
and create the life that you actually want.
Want. Yes, ma'am.
And it becomes, you know, it's like…
My therapist told me that life is about two things.
Living life for pleasure, and gratefulness, and joy,
but also the understanding that the downtime is gonna come.
-Ugh. Yes. -And if you can, sort of…
be somewhere in the middle of that and understanding that,
then you could, sort of… It's survivable.
For me, when I was younger, I thought I was cursed.
I was like, "Okay, um, you know, no one thinks I'm cute."
"So I don't have that."
"I'm poor. I don't have any money, any resources." [chuckling]
You know, I have a lot of violence in the family.
I was like, "Where's my sunlight?"
"Where is it?"
Until once again, this is the power.
I say it to people all the time.
You find people in your life who love you.
And what those people do, because they love you,
and they love all of you, even your flaws,
is they give you permission to be able to love yourself.
What do I mean by that?
Ron Stetson who said, "Don't you know, you're beautiful, Viola?"
"I've always seen you as beautiful."
"You do?"
-Okay. I wanna go to that moment. -Yep.
The first time you show up at Upward Bound,
this is an organization that's helping kids from the inner city.
I love this moment where Ron is talking about,
uh, what it means to be an actor.
And every… "Who wants to be an actor?" He asks the question.
And everybody raises their hand.
And as he continues to talk about how difficult it is to be an actor…
How many rejections you're gonna have, how hard you're gonna have to work,
how many times you get turned down.
the hands start going down, and the hands start going down, and the hands start going down,
and yours is the last hand remaining.
And you say that my dreams were bigger than my fears.
[Viola] Absolutely.
I needed a dream
like I needed food and water.
That dream wasn't just a goal.
That dream was my way out,
was my, sort of, salvation.
You know, I just wanna interrupt here to say, uh…
You know, I grew up poor.
Having read your story, I… I don't even understand,
uh, poverty like the kind you have experienced.
And what I came away from, the book,
believing is that the shame of it,
the shame of it is actually the worst.
And there is a story that you tell here
about a time where the electricity was off,
there was no gas, the pipes were frozen,
you all had all wet the bed. Everybody is at home, you can't…
Everybody is at home, you can't… There's nowhere you can go.
And your sister, Diane, decided she was gonna go to school.
And she got up and she spit her face and wiped her face and said,
-"I'm going. How do I look?" -Mm-hmm.
And then your mother decided you all were gonna leave to go find heat.
Can you describe that moment?
I just picture all of you walking down the street in your, you know, shoes and the holes in your shoes.
you know, shoes and the holes in your shoes.
-It's Rhode Island. It's snowing and cold. -Freezing. Mm-hmm.
And the teacher, Mrs. Prosser, comes out and sees you on the road…
And says, "Mrs. Davis, Mrs. Davis, why aren't your kids in school?"
"They haven't been in school all week."
And my mom says, "We don't have no heat."
"Um, the pipes are frozen, so the water don't even come out."
"And we all really cold, and we don't have no food." And… and then she, Mrs. Prosser,
And… and then she, Mrs. Prosser, who, once again,
who, once again,
you know, one of those people that gives you permission.
Yeah.
[Viola] Okay. Um…
She had tears in her eyes,
and she was touching our faces, and she said, "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Davis."
"I'm so, so sorry."
"You let us know whatever we can do, you know, for you."
"I'm so sorry."
But, you know,
Mrs. Prosser is interesting.
Mrs. Prosser would call me to her office from time to time
with a bag full of the most beautiful clothes
that were hand-me-downs from her daughter.
And she would give it to me because she knew I needed clothes,
which by the way, I was like… it was like giving me just some jewels
When you are in the face of compassion
and empathy…
…it's amazing how it kills shame.
Because you're seen.
And you're seen for something way more valuable than your circumstances.
[Oprah] Yeah.
That's why I bring her up. She saw you. -She actually saw you. -Yeah.
I remember when, I think it was a teacher or a nurse
who had come to… who had been assigned to speak to you about hygiene
because you were wetting the bed all the time.
So you'd come to school smelling like urine,
and she gave you this lecture about how to go home and clean up yourself,
and you did.
I think that at the end of the day, what I was looking for is love.
Yeah.
That sort of radical… power of love.
[Oprah] You have so many beautiful moments like that in here.
I… Do you know why I love that moment so much?
Because I-- Teachers were my saviors.
-Absolutely, my saviors. -[Oprah] Teachers were my saviors.
[Viola] Like I said, there's power in love. It's radical.
But I can't describe, even in words,
that it was a hard, uh, story to tell
because at the same time, my sister Deloris was also called to the office.
We were both called because we smelled really bad that day.
-[Oprah] Mm-hmm. -And-- Could you smell yourself? Did you know you smelled?
-Yeah. -[Oprah] You did?
-I didn't know what to do about it. -Yeah.
You know, I think that people just automatically assume,
well, you just clean yourself.
-[Oprah] Mm-hmm. -Well, not if anyone doesn't show you.
Once again, going back to the Stevie Wonder song.
"Show me how to do what you do. Show me how to do it."
-No one showed me. -[Oprah] Mm-hmm.
And we didn't have any hot water.
A lot of times we didn't have any soap.
A lot of times we didn't even have any clean clothes.
You know, we'd wash the clothes by hand the night before,
hang them up to dry, and try not to hang them outside.
Because we'd hang them outside sometimes, but it's cold.
-So, the next day, they're icicles. -They'd freeze. Yes.
So you hang them out to dry,
and the next day, if they're not dry, they're wet.
But then if you're not clean, you're putting on wet clothes…
It's all the… People don't realize that if no one shows you,
People don't realize that if no one shows you,
then you have to figure it out on your own.
And I didn't have the tools to figure it… figure it out on my own.
And then I was ashamed that I didn't have the tools to figure it out on my own.
So then all I had, all I could do was swim in the shame.
Yes. I love… There's a line that you use.
I think it's on page 89 where you talk about…
You're… People are always saying, "Just do better. Do better."
"Try harder. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps."
But hard to pull yourself up when you don't have a boot.
Absolutely.
Absolutely. You know it's… it's… it's the vision of what you want in your life.
You know it's… it's… it's the vision of what you want in your life.
Right? The… Or the discovery of what you wanna do.
It's a vision of where you wanna end up,
but there's this whole part in between of how to get there.
That whole journey of someone who gives you that rope,
that… that… that sword,
that, you know,
that knife, whatever.
That whole in between is what you have to figure out.
And that was the thing that became rickety.
That I wanted someone to help me figure it out.
[Oprah] Yeah.
And In the midst of all this, there's also sexual abuse going on in the home.
There's nothing that didn't happen. -You had sexual abuse. -[Viola] Yeah.
Violence going on in the home.
You have the tyranny of colorism, sexism, racism.
I was so struck by the fact that your mother's story
I was so struck by the fact that your mother's story that she only went to the 8th grade because she was beaten in school
that she only went to the 8th grade because she was beaten in school
by the light-skinned teacher for not being light enough.
And that the same thing happened to your sister Diane
when she was in South Carolina.
Beaten by the teachers for not being light enough.
Beaten by Black teachers in a segregated school
for not being light enough.
Absolutely.
You know, I think that…
…failure and hardship is an interesting learning tool.
Because I think that once you hit bottom,
then you either stay there or you figure out how to rise up. [Oprah] Mm-hmm.
And I think that that's what happened with all of us.
Even my sister Diane back in the day,
and my mom, that you either survive or you don't.
[Oprah] The sisters, you all were your own little army.
[Oprah] Where would you be without your sisters?
-[Viola] Yeah. [laughing] -You said you all were your own platoon.
-Yes. Absolutely. -[Oprah] Yeah. Yeah.
[Oprah] And on page 75, you write this about your sisters.
You say, "Some battles we won,
survived together and emerged with laughter and perspective,
and some brutal ones, sexual abuse, we lost."
"Sexual abuse back in the day didn't even have a name."
No, it didn't.
It's just, you know, that dirty old man on the street,
you know, who wanted to give you a quarter, but then wanted a kiss.
you know, who wanted to give you a quarter, but then wanted a kiss. [Oprah] Mm-hmm.
No one knows what boundaries are with little girls,
especially back in the day.
So, if a… a guy said, you know, "Give me a kiss."
Someone said, "Oh, give him a kiss. It's not a big deal."
Or someone leaves you with a male babysitter
because that male babysitter is a friend of the family.
And then your parents go out and they leave you alone.
They don't think anything of it.
You know, we didn't have social media back in the day
where people would talk about statistics of how many girls are molested--
That's right. Wasn't even… wasn't even… wasn't even a word for it.
But I think what you've done in this book
is revealed a part of yourself that is really a part of us all.
Yeah. [Oprah] Every person who's struggling for self-love,
and I just so appreciate you being honest enough to be able to say
that when you were first on stage,
and you would get the adulation and the applause,
and the people saying, "I'm so moved by what you've done and what you acted,"
that you…
At first, you are satiated by that, for a moment,
but then you come to recognize that that really has nothing to do with self-love,
and actually begins to create this feeling of being an impostor.
Absolutely.
You feel, first of all, you feel an impostor in your work. [chuckling]
I didn't wanna feel the impostor in my life.
I would think this book is my gift to others.
[Oprah] Yes.
I felt like it was, uh… it was a sort of…
It was a gift to yourself.
It was a releasing for yourself, but… and in that releasing,
all the other people are gonna be so served by this story.
-I hope so. -[Oprah] Yeah.
It's my way of owning my story.
It's my way of not, sort of, sweeping it under the rug
and creating this other image of me
because I feel like in creating this different image,
it's proving to those boys that I actually was all those things…
[Oprah] That they tried to call you.
-[Viola] Absolutely. -That they called you.
Or tried to make you believe.
And that you believed for such a long time.
Yes. Yeah.
I would have to say what I came away from Finding Me,
thinking I dis-- discovered anew about you
is that you have this indomitable courage.
It's courage.
You know Maya used to always say,
"Courage is the most important of the virtues
because without it, you cannot practice anything."
And in here, Finding Me, you talk about courage is the real cure.
So there was a… there was a point in your life
where you had decided that you were just gonna be a teacher,
and you were not gonna act, even though you loved it… you loved it.
And share with everyone how you started to feel depressed.
There was a sadness that came over you
because you were not doing the thing that you knew you needed to do.
Yeah, when I went to college, when I first entered college,
um, I said I can't major in theater.
That is not a profession that can pay the bills.
And I really needed to pay my bills.
-[Oprah] Yeah. -'Cause I did not wanna be on welfare.
I wanted to not be what my… what I felt my parents were.
Yeah. [Viola] And so then I fell into a great depression
in denying that creative spirit in me
until I think my sister Deloris said,
"Why aren't you majoring in theater, Viola?"
And I said, "Because I can't make any money doing that, Deloris."
She said, "But that's what you love to do. That's who you are."
And, you know, what you begin to understand is that whole Anne Lamott quote, which is,
"All courage is, is fear said with prayers."
[Viola] That… I understood that the fear was not gonna go away.
That, "Viola, there is a huge chance that maybe it's not gonna land, and it's not gonna work,
that maybe it's not gonna land, and it's not gonna work,
but dangonnit, it's worth the try."
Dangonnit.
-[Viola] You know? -Yes.
Yeah.
[Oprah] Viola electrified the stages of Rhode Island College,
graduating in 1988 with a degree in theater.
Because she could only afford just one application fee for graduate school,
she auditioned for one of the most prestigious programs,
Juilliard, and got in.
Three years after graduating from Juilliard,
Viola made her Broadway debut in August Wilson's, Seven Guitars.
Her rave reviews put her on the next path to television and movies.
What's your name?
It's got nothing to do with me, but that offer, he was a part of it.
[Oprah] When did you realize, Viola, that being on stage or acting was the path to healing for you?
that being on stage or acting was the path to healing for you?
Oh, the minute I started doing it.
The minute I did the first skit when I was nine years old, I realized
it had the ability to heal me.
All the things I couldn't express in my life,
if I expressed it on stage would be celebrated.
[Viola] You play a character who's a runaway
who has trauma from parents,
and you expressed all of that onstage in a way that was honest and truthful,
then the audience celebrates it.
They celebrate seeing that level of humanity,
and you can't express that in your real life.
Oh, you can, but you risk being shamed.
So from the moment I started doing skits,
I felt like whatever I can't express in my life,
I could do it in a character.
I wanna just rip open what it means to be a human being
and show it to you in all its ugliness, beauty, contradictions, and complexity.
In that way, I think that's what saved my life.
That's what healed me.
It was my conduit of being able to take all the trauma, all the spew, everything,
and feed it through that vacuum of these characters
and give it to you.
Re-- recreated.
'Cause one of the things that you say is that,
'Cause one of the things that you say is that, "I'm not here…"
"I-I'm not here to create some fantasy."
Your job, as you see it as an actor, is to show us to ourselves.
-Absolutely. -[Oprah] Yeah. Absolutely.
-And not the politically correct self. -[Oprah] Yeah.
Don’t you think it ever crossed my mind to want to know other men?
That I wanted to lay up somewhere and forget about my responsibilities?
That I wanted someone to make me laugh so I can feel good?
[Viola] Those stories that nobody wants to tell.
But I held on to you, Troy.
I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams,
and I buried them inside you…
[Viola] You know-- [Oprah] That's why you let snot run with Rose, when the snot was running.
[Oprah] That's why you let snot run with Rose, when the snot was running.
[Oprah] That's why when the snot was running in Fences you just say,
"That's what's happening with Rose. I'm gonna let it roll." Right?
Absolutely. I think everybody moves through life fighting to be seen.
Sometimes even by themselves, to themselves.
And the bravery for an actor is to look at a moment.
I did it with How To Get Away With Murder.
I said, "Listen,
I'm getting ready for bed."
"My husband is cheating on me." [chuckling]
-I mean, it's a melodrama. Right? -[Oprah] Yes.
So I can make a choice in this moment
of doing the TV thing,
which is to keep my beautiful hair weave and wig and my makeup
and just turn around and give him that one-line zinger,
or I can inject something in here.
Something that every woman who's sitting there on their couch
with the retainers, and their rollers, and no makeup--
-In our socks. Yeah. -And, you know, in socks…
can look at this and somehow feel some level of connection to this story.
So let me take the wig off.
[Viola] Let me take the makeup off because in doing that,
what I'm presenting you with is not the character of Annalise,
but the woman that is Annalise.
[Oprah] Wow. And I read that it was you who insisted that that happen in that scene.
And I read that it was you who insisted that that happen in that scene.
-[Viola] Yes, it was. -[Oprah] Yes.
What you wrote is, "Annalise Keating released in me the obstacles blocking me
from realizing my worth and power as a woman."
"If I were to mark the first time I fully used my voice,
it was in How to Get Away with Murder."
"That role liberated me."
What was it about Annalise that helped you step into your full power?
Because she was all the things that people said, not only I wasn't,
but people who look like me weren't.
You're not sexual.
No one's gonna find you attractive.
You're probably not having sex 'cause who would wanna… who would, um, desire you?
This was happening… this was nine years ago.
So people were saying that nine years ago?
Absolutely. I always… [laughing]
Yes, they were.
And… And that's why it was liberating because it absolutely is not true.
And that's why it was liberating because it absolutely is not true.
Listen,
just a fantasy of mine,
that there is any number of people who are sitting at home
waiting to be a part of the story.
To see themselves.
To feel some level of validation.
And I felt that Annalise was a perfect way for me to be able to do that.
Okay. I wanna get to… to Julius because he's such a…
has been such a…
He changed your whole life. Everything changed.
So let's get to the story where you…
You were talking to a friend and you said,
"I can't believe I… I keep running into all these assholes."
And she said, "Well, maybe you should look at yourself." -[Viola] Yeah. -Right?
And then you had a friend who told you to go home and pray for who you wanted.
-[Viola] Mm-hmm. -The kind of man you wanted.
And you actually got on your knees and you asked God for…
A big Black man. I said because he said,
"Viola, even…
He said, "Even the vacuous stuff. Just put it all in there." "Looks, everything."
I said, "Really? With God? I got to tell him that."
He's like, "Yes. You gotta put it all out there."
He was like, "Be careful."
And I went I got on my knees,
and I did. I said, "I want a big Black man from the south
who's probably been married before, has kids,
'cause I don't want any pressure in that department.
Someone who's maybe been an actor who understands the artistic community.
Someone who goes to church and loves God.
I said, "If you give me that, I'll start going to church, God."
"I really will."
"I… I'm… I'm committed to it."
[laughs] And then I signed off just like writing a letter.
And three and a half weeks later, I met Julius from Texas.
Ex-football player, 'cause actually that's one of the things I put on--
-[Oprah] You asked for a football player. -[Viola] A football player. Athlete.
Ex- football player, been married.
Raised his children on his own.
Was an actor.
Invited me to church.
And, um,
I thought to myself,
"Whoa."
Did you know immediately that he is what you'd prayed for?
-Yeah! -[Oprah] You did?
[Viola] I went home. I was amazed.
I started calling.
Especially… My friend Patrice, especially.
I said, "Patrice."
"I met a man."
[Viola] And she said, "Girl no." I said, "Yeah."
"I really think I met somebody."
And then I made the connection with her too. I told her everything.
I was shocked. Sort of like magic.
Um, yeah.
[Oprah] Your life hasn't been the same since the two of you actually became bonded together.
since the two of you actually became bonded together.
[Viola] It has not been the same.
[Oprah] That's why this book is so important.
I called up Gayle. I go, "You need to do what Viola did."
"You need to get down on your knees." "You need to pray and ask for what you want."
But also looking for the kind of life he has led before you.
I was in therapy at the time, and I remember my therapist just saying,
"Viola, find someone who loves you."
"Just find someone who loves you."
And I remember saying that to Julius too.
"I'm just looking for someone who'd just lay down their life for me, that loves me."
He's like, "I love you."
And I remember we both stopped, and I looked at him, and he looked at me.
-Aw. -[Viola] You know? He was like, "I'm all those things, V. I am."
And then we… we made something to eat like we'd usually do. [laughing]
You say there are moments in your life that absolutely live up to the hype.
And one of those moments certainly was the adoption of Genesis.
[Oprah] How did it change you as a woman?
In 2011, Viola and her husband, Julius,
adopted a baby girl who was living in foster care
in Viola's home state of Rhode Island.
They named her "Genesis."
Today Genesis is 11.
[Viola] Oh man, Genesis.
You know, to live for something bigger than yourself.
I mean, that's what it was.
The first time she looked at me and squeezed me
and made me believe that I could be her mom,
and I could mother her and…
And that, sort of, just really pure love that only children can give you.
[Viola] And I'll tell you one thing.
All of the tools you need to raise a little girl,
the affirmations, all those things,
while you're doing that, you're healing yourself.
[Oprah] Yeah. My next question is,
how have you navigated raising a daughter
when you never got what you needed
when you were being raised?
It's my opportunity to be able to do that.
And so does it feel like giving that back to yourself?
-[Viola] Absolutely. -Yes.
Little Viola is always running around.
You know, sort of guiding me.
Yeah. And also Genesis being very different from who I am
is helping me also see myself in a different way.
[Oprah] You wrote this on social media about your own mother, May Alice.
You said, "This is the woman who birthed me, loves me, and would die for me."
"Our bond runs deeper than anything man-made or given."
"No one can love you like your mama loves you."
"Not even the love of your life."
So what did you learn from your own mother
that you have now been able to pass on and transfer to Genesis?
Number one, that I believe my mom did the best she could with what she knew.
And also,
my mom is very smart.
My mom sees people and she sees through people.
Oh, she could read them, right? She's one who can read them.
-Yeah. -[Oprah] She could read 'em. Yeah.
I appreciate that.
Yeah. When I talk to you about Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,
You said, one of the ways you go into examining a character,
one of the many ways,
is by asking, "What is this character living for?"
Yeah. [Oprah] So I end our conversation today with,
what are you, Viola Davis, now living for?
First of all, I'm living for my peace and my joy.
I am.
I wanna be happy in my life.
And I know happiness is a journey.
It's not a destination.
I know it's speckled with bad,
but I wanna feel some level of peace and joy in my life.
Absolutely.
To help people to live better.
Absolutely.
You have done that.
In finding yourself, you've helped all of us
who hear your story, who read your story,
who see you be the light you are…
-Thank you. -…find a part of ourselves.
And I thank you so much.
I'm so excited for people to read Finding Me.
It is astonishing
what you have been able to endure.
And for us to see you to come into this other side of yourself,
makes it possible for us to believe it's possible for ourselves.
So, thank you.
-Thank you, Oprah. [chuckling] -[Oprah] Thank you, Viola.
I just wanna say to you all, Finding Me is available on April 26th,
wherever books are sold.
And the audio book too. [in Viola's voice] Viola in her world-famous Viola voice…
[in normal voice] …reads her own story that you all need to hear.
So I hope you'll get a book.
And when you get it, buy one for a friend,
'cause you're gonna want to talk about it with a friend.
That's what I did with Gayle.
I got it, and then Gayle's like, "Well, send me a copy."
BUT GANG FIGHTS BETWEEN INSTITUTES WERE ALSO RISING FOR UNKNOWN REASONS.
THESE FIGHTS WERE ROOTED IN FALSE BELIEFS AND TOXIC CULTURES,

You don’t have to go, Dad.
Why wouldn't I?
It’s Father’s Day.
You look like hell.
-Amm. -Damn stink of alcohol.
You came home at dawn.
It’s the Father’s Day ceremony at school,
not Alcohol Day.
Amm.
Why?
What are you going to say now?
You are always like this, year after year.
Your pants have sweat stains all over them.
And look at your shoes.
You’d wear that junk to my school?
I'm ashamed.
Amm.

MR. PUTTIPONG
Yes, Mr. Puttipong.
Billy, the concrete beam is not settling yet.
It can’t be, the guys just finished it at 4 a.m.
Where are you? Aren't you at the construction site?
Oh, damn!
Out of my way, damn it!
Come on.
Come on in. Come on.
I said get out of my way.
They are fighting out there. Where would I go?
I’m going to help my daughter.

Hello.
I’m Suwicha, Inthira's teacher.
Remember me?
Mr. Pranott.
I sent the blueprint for project four last night.
Yes, sir. I owe you this time.
Thank you.
Amm, do I have to prepare for the parents’ meeting?
Students got into a gang fight again.
They are from two different vocational schools this time
and it was right in the middle of Samut Sakhon
with swords and homemade hand grenades involved.
There's a report that a soldier…
Teens these days…
What’s wrong with them?
They were charging at each other with long swords.
Like you’ve never done that.
The jurisdiction of Krathum Baen police station.
A soldier who was driving by…
Back then it was not like this.
It was not like this?
What was it like then?
Like real men?
I've never seen any technical student act like a real man.
-Amm… -You're telling me not to generalize.
The fact that I’m crippled,
isn’t it because of technical students like you?

Hey, pay up.
I'm getting off.
Schmuck, does your tuition fee cover all bus fares?
You never pay your stuff, twat.
Oh, oh?
Mister,
other than caffeine,
only a good beating up gets me vibing.
What a jerk.
I had a look at you While you were sleeping
You seemed so innocent
Hey, Lupin.
Why are you so into singing?
Quit school and get a record deal already.
Oh damn! It’s not that I love singing, Billy.
I just love music,
so I keep rehearsing.
Stone Metal Fire have a concert at the end of the year.
I’m telling you, I’m going to shine.
Just watch me, you’ll be so high.
Yes, Lupin. I believe you.
You always had potential.
Only Jae Danupol is cooler than you.
The gig is at the end of the year, why the rush?
Come on, Billy.
You can’t spell the word "target"?
Targets are for attacks.
And I'm planning a big attack there.
Hey! CHOLs alert!
Old man, stop!
INs!
CHOLs!
CHOLs? We're INs!
Idiot, do one!
Let my friend show off!
Billy!
Get your medicine at the counter.
You are invincible. Where did you get the tattoo?
Invincible your ass.
Got 18 stitches on my back.
Billy.
Sorry…
that I was too late.
No. Why sorry?
If it hadn't been for you, Mod would have chopped me up.
You think too much.
Dad, hello…
You only bring me trouble.
Your brain
ever come up with something good?
See you.
Are you leaving?
See you tomorrow.
You can’t be mad at me, Au.
I’m here on time.
Da,
I've missed my period for two months now.
You serious?
Are you joking with me?
No, seriously.
I'm not messing with you about this.
It's not a joke, Da.
Don’t think too much.
Whatever happens, happens.
What about my parents?
You don't have to worry.
I’ll figure it out somehow.
I am responsible for this.
But it is a serious matter, Da.
It is serious to me as well.
Da, let’s get a taxi.
The Buranapons are all over the station.
If you have a girl around, they don't do it.
It would be despicable if they did.
Hey.
Walking with your head high.
Do you think you are Andy Lau?
Pickup, go home, get laid.
Don’t you have it all too easy?
You can have it easy.
But if you want it difficult,
you might get a bit sweaty.
It’s kind of hot around here.
Want a drink?
Okay.
Enough, you idiot. I’ll choke.
You come with a girl, drink up.
Whenever you come alone,
I’ll beat the crap out of you.
Hey.
Make way for Andy Lau.
Give me a cigarette.
Let’s eat.
Thanks, Mom.
-Mom -Yes.
Billy will stay with us for a while.
Sure, make yourself at home.
But… are you on a run?
No, I’m not.
I have a problem with my stepdad.
I’m kidding.
Da told me everything.
Just relax, son.
Thank you.
-Da. -Yes, Mom.
Why don’t you invite Au for dinner?
You know her dad is very strict.
She can’t stay out late.
A policeman’s daughter.
And you, make sure you use protection.
Respect her dignity.
Protect what?
Well, you know.
Au and I are not like that.
Come on, just do as I say.
Yes, Mom.
Let me answer the phone.
Mischievous, isn’t he?
You seem to be very close to him.
Yeah.
It’d be nice if you were my family.
All families are different.
It’s like this here.
Many are not.
You are a man now.
Stay with the present. Look toward the future.
Forget the past.
-Very wise. -Right.
TO INTRA WITH CONDOLENCES FROM CHOL
Are you sure, X?
Yeah, they usually hang around here.
What a smelly alley.
Are you sure Da is here?
Not sure.
But if he turns up,
it'll be this mofo's last day.
Turn off the engine.
Whoa. Those CHOLs.
What are they doing here?
Surely they are looking for trouble.
What the hell are you doing?
I’ve always wanted to face them.
Now I have a chance,
I'll welcome them with my number 12.
Forget the drugs, I'd rather hit them.
When I shoot them, you take off. Okay?
My name is goddamn Yad!
Let's go!
My friend? My friend?
Where are you going, coward?
Who sent you here? Scumbag!
Damn, Mod.
Enough, Mod!
He’s going to die.
Stop!
Go!
Do one, scumbag!
Go!
Like a drama that you have to act
It’s because of some kind of force
The force of love, lust, so powerful
That commands you to do anything
Enough with your force of love!
Idiot freeloaders!
What a waste of my stuff!
Aunty, music is drug prevention.
Right, Lupin.
Like this alcohol you are drinking is not addictive?
What would you know? It’s medicinal.
Doc told me it's good for circulation.
Why did you sell it to me then?
For you it’s like charity.
My shop will be shut down because of you.
Damn!
Jeez.
Honorable freeloader, have you heard of it?
So fierce.
For the SMF gig this year,
I have my new Converse to attract chicks.
They’re going to be thrilled.
Where did you get the money?
He snatched some Scholls from the mall yesterday.
Got five pairs.
What did you do with five pairs?
Hey,
Billy.
Look at those…
Scholl.
Mint condition.
Just watch me.
Gotcha. Gotcha.
Kiddo.
Hey, kid!
Hey, kid.
Kiddo!
Oh!
Pretending to ignore me?
I guess I can’t play nice.
Seems like you need Arahan palms.
Kid, you have nice shoes.
Can I have them?
Come on! Take them off!
Damn.
Very good. I love obedient young men.
Let’s go.
Bro.
How are they?
Brother.
They smell right.
Yeah.
-I mean you, jackass. -What?
Can I have 40 baht for more games?
You wasted my time, I thought you’d be tough.
So you bought them, Mr. Customer.
Damn.
But I didn’t have to go to the shop, right?
Oh, damn.
Who is coming to the SMF concert this year?
School girls maybe? Damn!
Billy, what are you talking about?
We are the flashiest.
Listen to me carefully.
There must be Lupin with INs.
"Lupin." Do you get it?
Billy.
I think the CHOLs and KANOKs will be there.
Let them bind together,
I’ll take care of that.
Damn.
Also KANOKs and PAYUs.
Those scumbags are violent.
Are you scared, you dork?
Let those losers come,
I’ll slap their heads one by one.
Mr. Customer,
what did you call Billy again?
A dork.
Loudmouth.
Schmuck. Dork.
Hell.
It's for you, bro.
I’ve got a Flirt Card.
How’s that?
"Can I have your number?"
Jealous, huh?
With my looks, girls can't help falling for me.
Is she pretty?
Of course, I wouldn’t do it if she wasn’t.
Guide me to that girl.
Sure.
-Let’s go. -Follow me.
Excuse me, guys.
You can compete in a boat race,
but you can’t compete in luck.
I gotta go for now.
Come on, dork.
-Such a bully. -Hurry.
-So full of crap. -Crap talker.
Where is she, huh?
It's the end of the line for you here.
Go. Go home.
I’m Lupin of INTRA.
What do you want me to do?
You'll get your ass kicked, son of a bitch!
Scumbag!
Schmuck!
Schmuck!
I said stop.
Don’t run, damn it.
Don’t you get it? I said stop.
Where are you running to?
Heck!
Hey, KANOKs!
Billy, get down!
What the hell are you doing?
Go!
Billy, you get hit?
I'm okay.
Lupin?
Holy hell! Lupin!
Scumbag!
Lupin!
Dad.
Can I have some money?
We're going school camping in Kanchanaburi.
Sure, are you staying overnight?
How many days, so I know how much?
Four days.
I’ll prepare you some coats.
It might be cold there.
Take my camera.
You can take some pictures with your friends.
Alright.
You should go longer.
Not as tough as your tongue.
Can you please calm down?
He might have thought it through.
You'd better shut up.
There is no point being nice to him.
I put your stuff in the dog cage.
If you want to come back,
stay in the dog cage!
Isn't that too harsh?
To discipline him.
He got his dad’s vile blood.
Don’t talk crap about my dad!
-Billy! -What are you gonna do?
It’s my house. What are you gonna do?
You think you are tough?
I beg you, please.
Why? Can’t I discipline your ex's son?
You!
-Enough, Dad. Dad! -Billy!
Get your stuff out of my house.
Don’t ever come back!
Get out!
Billy, I’m sorry.
You don’t need to apologize.
It’s my fault that I'm your son.
Just stay away for a while.
Billy!
You took Au home today?
Yes, Mom.
Do her parents know about you?
They do, but…
they don’t really like me.
Especially her dad.
Are you serious about her?
Of course I am.
Like really serious?
Then prove yourself.
Yes, Mom.
Da.
Is that Billy?
Yes, I’ll go see him.
As soon as you got back?
Forget it. Get inside.
Mom.
-Hello, Mom. -Hi.
Can I…?
Yes, make yourself at home.
Thank you.
Have you eaten?
No.
I’ll make you an omelet. Come.
-Billy. -Huh?
I have something to tell you.
What is it?
Au is pregnant.
Holy crap.
What are you going to do?
I’ll take care of them. I’m a real man.
But you are still in school.
You have no job.
But I have my hands and feet.
It’s my child so I’ll take care of it.
Does your mom know?
No.
I’ll find the right time.
How about her family?
Not yet.
That’s a big problem.
Don't go, I'm begging you
I'm begging you to stop singing already.
You have been singing all day.
Are you going to the Kai Pang concert, channel 7?
Are you, Da, Billy?
Of course.
It’s Pang we are talking about.
Yeah.
How about you, Da?
Don’t tell me you are not going.
If you won’t, I won’t.
Can I just go to the SMF concert?
I’ll pass on this one.
Why is that?
Or you don’t like alternative music?
Are you anxious about Au?
Yeah.
See, Billy? I knew it.
Did Au break up with you?
I told you, she's stuck-up.
I’m good at reading people.
Wait.
No break up.
Au is pregnant, idiot.
Huh? Au is pregnant?
Damn.
How did it happen?
They stared at each other and she got pregnant.
What a stupid question, idiot.
That’s not what I meant.
I meant how did you let her get pregnant?
I gave you condoms, why didn’t you use them?
Do her parents know?
Not yet.
Just calm down, don’t overreact.
Read my lips,
don’t dwell on the past
and don’t long for the future
or you’ll lose your present.
That works for me.
So in the present, you go to the concert with me.
Yes, Lupin.
I hope in the present,
you don’t get kicked out like last time.
Snap out of it, man.
To be frank…
I’ll stay through to the end.
This is how you snap.
Come on, I really want you to be there.
Hey, don’t stress.
We’ll think about that later.
It’s for the Kai Pang concert,
let’s just go.
Fine, I’ll go.
That's my friend.
"Stay through to the end."
How’s that, you idiot?
So you said you would not get kicked out, Lupin?
Scumbag! Those CHOLs really got on my nerves,
so I have to give it to them.
I told you I shouldn’t have come.
We're the BUs from Bang Na
No one bats an eye We're the unfortunate tech students
Ministry of Education couldn't care less
They say we're punks
Heck! There are a hundred BUs ahead.
We're diligently repeating the year
Making sure the world knows We're despicable
We're BUs, BUs!
What do we do?
Just get on with it.
CHOLs!
Damn, so many of them.
Seems like they want to eat my foot.
They want a show, let them come.
We never know.
The BUs might run away.
But leave the CHOLs to me.
Let's have some fun.
Is everybody okay? Get hit?
BANG SUE POLICE STATION
Stop!
What are you doing?
Face down!
Hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back.
Are you tough?
Get up!
Everybody, up! Now!
Officer, take them to the van.
Go!
Calm down. Go further in. Up you go.
I’ll whip your ass.
Move.
-What are you doing? -Why?
-Get on. -Sit down or I’ll whip your ass.
Hey.
-Jerk! -Billy!
Sit down!
Want to try me?
Still fighting? Hey.
I'll hit you.
So gritty.
You have nothing else to do?
You thinking what I’m thinking?
Of course, moron.
I was arrested once.
I get booked again, I’ll be gone for long.
-What are you going to do? -I don’t know.
Let me handle it.
Tell your guys to be prepared.
You'd better make it, jackass.
Damn you. Always get on my nerves.
I’ve despised you for so long.
-Want to go one-on-one with me? -Stop!
I said stop.
Officer, I'm done.
Can I go one-on-one with this jerk?
He’s doing my head in.
Fine. But the loser…
will get beaten up. I warn you.
You moron. Loose mouth.
Do you know channel 7 Muay Thai?
I’ll make you the highlight of the day.
You're Channel 7?
Then I’m the Dark Knight, schmuck!
Damn. If you are both from…
Channel 7 and Dark Knight,
Then I’m Songchai Ratanasubun?
Fight.
-IN! -CHOL!
Quiet!
When are you going to start?
Go on.
One…
Two!
Damn! Still counting?
Annoying as hell!
-Three! -Hey!
-Run! -Go!
-What the hell? -Stop!
Sit down!
Sit down!
Hey, guys.
Let me ask you this,
why do you guys fight?
What is it for?
I see you guys always having street fights.
If there were no idiots like you in this country,
it would be much more developed.
The three of you…
have you ever asked yourselves
why you have to fight?
Year after year, I've always seen you fight.
Just use your brain. Think hard.
"Year after year, you fight."
Like you police are good, what a jerk.
Can you answer his question though?
Why do we fight?
Sure.
Why then?
You are the BUs.
This jackass is the INs.
And I’m the CHOLs.
That’s sensible.
You have a point. I agree.
If I was not in the BUs, you were not in the CHOLs,
and that jackass was not in the INs,
would we still fight?
Young people in the US fight all the time.
They don’t even have patriotism for the institute,
they are just gang members.
All drug dealers.
How do you know?
Have you been there?
Piss off.
All I know is every country has their own problems.
It depends on how they solve their problems.
And what's the problem in the US?
Are you stupid?
Why?
Don’t you have cable TV in your area?
You are a jerk.
What’s wrong with you?
I really want to know.
It’s poverty.
Poverty?
How many cans of glue have you sniffed?
And what's the problem in this country?
How would I know, slimeball?
If I did, I’d be in parliament.
So do you or do you not know?
What is wrong with you? Why so quiet?
POLICE STATION WE PROTECT AND SERVE THE PEOPLE
Your parents are here to bail you out.
I’m sure they are not mine.
My parents.
Please sign an acknowledgement here.
Yes.
I’m not here to bail him out, I want to press charges.
What did you say?
Your son is a piece of crap.
He should be in jail as discipline
and know what being miserable is like.
Officer, he stole my camera.
If you really want to report your son,
file a report with the officer in charge.
Let’s go.
Wait, you can’t do that.
Stay out of this.
Billy.
I’m sorry.
You told him about the camera?
I’m sorry.
Mom,
let me ask you one thing.
What is it?
Why did you have me?
It’s my fault.
I’m sorry.
-Hi, boss. -Hi.
Are you doing well?
If I was doing well, I wouldn’t be here.
What did you do this time?
War with the INs at the Pang’s concert.
They got me busted.
Only three of you got busted?
This scumbag is BU, that jackass is IN.
How about you?
I’m okay.
The technical boys at house 4.
House 2 is for stray local guys.
Yad and his friends were busted for drugs and guns.
The whole gang is in here.
Don’t they fight?
The locals hate technical boys.
Damn right they do.
They outnumber us.
Clashed with the DONs since the first day.
These guards are mean.
They punish offenders severely.
Isn’t this Mr. Oh the CHOLs?
Are you here on vacation?
Never thought I would meet you here.
Yeah, I’m on vacation, hunting animals.
Oh, hunting animals?
What kind of animals?
We have them all here.
The crappy kind, I’m never bored of looking at.
Well, it’s not fun time now
because we hunt at night.
There is an IN guy here.
I’ve always wanted to chew you.
Let’s see if you live up to your reputation.
What the hell are you looking at?
What the hell are you looking at?
-Scumbag! -Hey.
-Slimeball. -Dirtbag!
This one is quite fierce.
You might want to get some jabs.
-Jerk. -Stop.
-Stop. -Don’t worry, you’ll have your chance.
But I’m hungry now. Got to eat.
I’ll save my dessert for later tonight.
-You slimeball! -Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Hey, you are not the IN here!
You are not the IN here!
Look at those creeps.
Look!
They hunt in groups. They are not like you!
You think the military police are cruel,
these guards are even worse.
I thought the CHOLs were fearless.
Let’s beat the crap out of them, see if they are tough.
Next time,
I don’t think they'll have the guts.
Damn.
Hey.
Don’t you know the rule?
What rule?
The big guy showers near the tap.
Is that so, schmuck?
It is not mentioned in the text book.
Then put it in your skull,
because the text books…
don’t tell you everything.
Well, go ahead, I’ll wait.
Sure.
I thought you were tough, schmuck.
Hey.
But in my book,
this is what it taught me.
Here come Social Studies.
Son of a bitch!
What the hell are you doing?
Who started this crap? Say it!
Or you all will be punished.
I did.
I started it.
Me too.
It’s done.
Is it?
Anything else?
If not, you'd better go home.
Alright.
Dad, if you need anything, please let me know.
Who’s your dad?
I'd never have a son like you.
Da, you should get back.
You can come again later.
Don’t come again ever
and stay away from my daughter.
Why do you talk like that?
Why can’t I?
I say what I like.
You have a problem?
But Au and I are seeing each other.
So?
You are together then, or what?
Au is my daughter.
Who I want her to date, is my decision.
Go. Get lost.
Da, please leave, trust me.
Goodbye, Mom.
Dad…
Au is pregnant.
What did you say?
I said…
Au is pregnant.
You impregnated my daughter?
Dad!
You punk. Son of a bitch. You piece of crap.
Da, listen to me, please go home.
Get out of my house!
And never come back again
or I will kill you!
Go!
Do one!
Da, please go home.
Goddamnit!
So many nice men…
Yet you choose this jerk!
Why?!
You caused trouble on your first day.
Two times for now
and you have to clean up the toilet tomorrow.
If you still cause more trouble,
there will be more coming.
Who will be the first?
I will.
Take a deep breath.
Deep breath.
Come on, one more.
Take a deep breath.
One last time, now you remember.
Come on.
Mom.
Are you hungry?
I cooked you some food.
Let’s eat.
Your favorite, stuffed bitter gourd soup.
What’s wrong, Mom?
What happened to you?
Why are you crying?
Did someone hurt you?
Today I met Aunt Duang Jai,
she invited you to Kik's graduation.
She doesn’t know that you…
Mom.
I’m sorry.
Mom.
Mom.
Damn it.
We were punished and still have to wash the toilet.
Why are you whining?
Why did you pick the smaller bucket?
You clean that zone, and this zone is mine.
Damn Oh.
You come to this zone, jerk.
They didn’t flush their crap. Damn!
Didn’t you start all of this?
Now we have to clean up crap.
You are the one who built it up.
You've had a go at him since we arrived.
Are you gonna talk crap or clean it?
I’m still in pain because of you.
Hurry up, scumbag.
Which room do you want me to wash? Let me help.
Were you just crying in the toilet?
What I do in the toilet is my business.
I’m a grown-up.
Just get on with it.
What the hell? You argue like kids.
Where’s my brush?
Why do you go to IN?
And you?
Why do you go to CHOL?
I asked you first.
Seriously, I have no idea why I went to CHOL.
This is strange.
We wear different uniforms out there.
But if I was not studying at CHOL,
I might end up like Yad.
No future.
Because we hold onto the institute's name.
I get to see my mom's tears.
Damn it.
I don’t know.
I think it’s the virtue of this.
Skills that teach us to survive.
People fight in all lines of work and study.
By the way,
if we all meet outside,
will we fight?
I don’t know.
We know each other now.
We'll just try to avoid each other in public.
If we can’t,
we’ll meet later to settle it.
All right,
friend?
Da, when will Billy get out?
In a few days.
Did his family visit him?
His mom sent letters and some money.
Poor Billy.
How did he manage to go back to school?
There's only one semester left.
Mom.
Billy will have to stay with us for a while.
Billy’s mom will send the money.
Sure, no problem.
Well?
Well?
Well…
I want to ask you…
what do you think about Au?
What do you mean? I don’t understand.
I mean, do you like Au or not?
Well… if you love her and think she is good for you,
then I love her too.
You gotta make a decision by yourself.
But…
is there something else?
No, nothing. I just want to know what you think.
I’ll wipe the plate.
-Hello, Mom. -Hello, Mom.
Hello.
Good luck.
Don’t come back here again.
-What's up? -What’s up, man?
Why are you here?
I’m sorry.
Please don’t be mad at me.
Take this money,
and finish your studies.
I’ll try to make things better with your stepdad.
We’ll be friends until we grow old
Share many memories from now on
Share sadness, happiness, dreams
Laugh and cry together
Until that day comes
Until we die
My turn.
Until that day, the day we die
Awesome.
Billy, you are really good at song writing.
It’s just a hobby, for Lupin.
Lupin?
I see that he likes singing.
One day he can be a singer.
I don’t think he can.
But you, maybe after graduation.
Nah.
Hey, the SMF concert is in a few days.
What is your decision?
I don’t know.
How about you?
You go, I go.
If you don’t, me neither.
Okay, I’ll go.
Really?
Yes, it’s the last gig before we graduate.
Damn! Attaboy.
We’ll have a great time.
Why?
Lupin has been preparing since the start of the year.
-Our Lupin? -Yeah.
He talks about this concert every day.
Prepares his costume early.
Yeah, he’s quite something.
Billy.
Let me ask you something.
What?
When my baby is born,
what will your gift be?
I don’t know yet.
But I’ll have a gift for sure.
I’ll be back.
Hello.
Hello, Da. It’s Au.
What are you doing?
Playing guitar with Billy.
How are you, Au?
What are you doing? Did you eat?
Da.
Have you told your mom that I’m pregnant?
Not yet.
I will tell her after the SMF concert.
The SMF concert…
is it that important to you?
Au, it’s the last thing with my friends.
Don’t sulk. It’s not a big deal.
Right.
It’s not a big deal.
I got to go.
Okay, Au.
Au…
I love you.
Sweet dreams.
It was Au.
She doesn’t want me to go.
What will you do?
It’s one last time. Come on.
After my baby is born, I will…
just be a good father.
Okay, let’s do it.
IN
One word that makes the world delightful
It turns bitterness into sweetness
One word that makes you cry
That takes all your hopes It makes you want to die
That makes you a good person Like no one has ever seen
That makes you a bad person Like you have never been
One night that will make you enchanted
For no reason, you forget to breathe
Like a drama that you have to act
It’s because of some kind of force
The force of love, lust, so powerful
That commands you to do anything
The force of love, lust, so powerful
That commands you to do anything…
INTRA
Look at Lupin from INs.
Mod, look at him.
It's gonna be so goddamn fun!
The force of love, lust, so powerful
That commands you to do anything
The force of love, lust, so powerful
That commands you to do anything…
Hello, Mom.
Is Da home?
The force of love, lust, so powerful
That commands you to do anything
Anything, anything
Love makes you do anything
We all smile to everyone But it’s different in our mind
People seem friendly But they are not real
Look at ourselves, we realize
Deep down we don’t Want to be less than anyone
People fight for everything
Do everything to get what they want
We give up and become losers
We are generous and become victims
Stop trusting and be more pessimistic
Prevent it before dangers get to us…
That mofo Lupin is asking for it.
Very well. I like it.
Hey.
Paranoid, do I think too much, doc?
Paranoid, I’m insane, aren’t I, doc?
Paranoid, it’s curable, isn’t it, doc?
Paranoid, I’m afraid You’ll prolong my treatment
Did a good job, get praised and rewarded
It is actually misleading
When useful, you are always wanted
When useless, they replace you
Everybody is looking For their own benefit…
INs!
INs!
CHOLs!
Paranoid, do I think too much, doc?
KANOKs!
KANOKs!
BUs!
Come on.
Come on, scumbag.
KANOKs!
I’m afraid you’ll prolong my treatment…
IN!
You're gonna get it, schmuck.
INs!
Doc!
Please help. Doc!
This way!
This way.
Family waits here.
Goddamnit!
I told you. Who shone tonight?
INs!
Did you see their faces?
Mod must have been so mad.
He deserves it.
It could have been worse.
Yeah.
I told you, where there are INs, there is…
Billy.
Lupin, you dork.
Let me call Au.
You are a dork.
Ta-da!
What are you doing?
Counselling.
-I’m a watchdog. -Moron.
I can talk to my girlfriend.
Don’t drink it all.
Hello, Au?
What did you say, Au?
Hey!
Hey.
Follow him.
-Da! -Da!
-Da! -Da!
Da!
-Da! -Da!
-Da. -Au!
-Da. -Au!
Au!
Au!
1144, please state your pager number.
Seenoom messaged that he saw Da the IN
and two friends on his street.
Au!
Au!, It’s me, Da!
Au!
Hey, Da.
What are you doing?
Come on, if you want to die.
You'd better go back.
I won’t.
You’ll be charged with trespassing and sex with a minor.
Go ahead.
If you want to get me arrested, do it.
But I’ll tell the police
that you will take Au to get an abortion.
Dad!
You can’t get rid of my baby.
You don’t have the right to tell me what to do!
I do.
The baby is mine!
But Au is my daughter!
And I don’t want her to have a baby with you.
Look at yourselves.
You're like a bunch of dogs,
running around and biting people.
Dogs?
What's wrong with dogs?
Dogs love their puppies.
We are human.
We also have right to be fathers!
Do you think I'm heartless?
Yes!
Because people like you have no future.
Can you tell me what the future looks like?
Have you ever seen it?
Although we have no future, we still have hearts.
Tell me the truth, Au.
Do you really want to get an abortion?
Da.
If I keep the baby,
can you really take care of us?
I’m only 17.
You are still in school,
you don’t even have a job.
So for the baby and myself…
what will it be like?
Can you tell me?
I don’t think we're ready.
You know, before all of this…
I never thought of anything like this.
Until today…
it’s today, Da.
You went to the concert.
You always go and fight.
And you…
you still think I can rely on you?
Can I, Da?
Au. Please calm down.
I understand what you said, but…
can I ask you only one thing?
Please keep the baby, I’ll take care of it.
You will?
You can’t even take care of yourself.
How can you take care of a baby?
Enough.
No matter what you think
or what you say,
I’ll never let my daughter
stoop down to your level.
My level? What's low?
You want her to have an abortion, that’s the lowest!
Enough with this.
Do you want to die? Come at me!
-Come on. -No.
Dad. Enough.
No.
No, calm down.
Dad.
I’m sorry that I snapped at you.
I’m sorry about the crappy things I said.
But the only thing I ask,
can you let Au keep the baby?
After she delivers the baby, I’ll raise it.
I’ll be responsible for everything.
And she still has to bear it for nine months.
You only think about your own benefit.
When her tummy gets bigger,
Au, I and my whole family
have to be embarrassed.
Mod and his friends, Billy.
Billy!
I really don’t know what to do, Dad. I really don’t.
The only thing I know,
please let Au keep the baby.
Please, and after she gives birth,
she doesn’t have to do anything else.
I will never come to see her again.
Please let her keep the baby.
Have mercy on it. Spare the baby’s life.
Da, why are you bowing to him?
This idiot doesn’t deserve your respect.
-Billy! -Dad, no!
-Lupin! -Mofo!
I said stop. Stop now.
Stop now! Stop.
What would you like me to do?
What would I do?
The way I beg and fall to my knees, everything is for my child.
It’s for my child, you get it?
Dad.
I know.
I’m useless. I’m an idiot, a piece of crap.
This is the best my life can do.
But my child's life…
please let it live.
Mod.
Even my friend goes to technical college
and seems like a crappy person
but ultimately the baby is his.
Please don’t force her to get an abortion.
We beg you.
Let’s go.
Finally, after three years.
Yeah, we graduated.
I never thought that we would graduate.
We've had so much fun in the past three years.
We went through so much,
all the bad and the good.
Oranges, Mom.
Yeah.
Three years…
I hadn’t slept well until you got this.
Shed so many tears.
You should look for higher education.
Get well paid so you can afford for your child.
I can still help with the expense at the moment.
Thank you, Mom.
Thank you.
He graduated from that crappy institute?
He's quite alright.
If you could go back in time,
would you go to vocational college?
That is an odd question.
Who would be able to go back in time?
Even the river doesn’t flow back.
Billy, the water flows in one direction in high tide,
it flows back the other way in low tide.
It will be the same tomorrow.
You idiot.
So deep.
If I could really choose.
If I could go back in time,
I wouldn’t choose this path.
I feel you, my friend.
But we can’t go back to fix anything.
Life is up and down just like the river.
Look at it that way.
Hell, yeah!
Even deeper than me.
Hey, come support me at the military draft.
Of course we’ll come.
Yeah.
Lupin, have you seen Rhang lately?
How is he? Quit using drugs?
He said he’d come to my military draft.
He’ll leave Wat Thamkrabok rehab in two weeks
but his dad won’t let him go back to IN.
He'll send him to Sripatum university.
So he won't go back to the same environment.
We did it!
Rhang, give me.
Wow! Damn, super black.
-Pass. -That’s awesome.
I got it.
You are going in?
The black ballot!
-How's that? -Attaboy.
Red ballot, mofo!
-I'm so pissed. -Damn.
Those scumbags are noisy.
God damn…
He's going solo.
Two officers locked my hands.
Why?
Stop me from running away? I don’t know.
-You're a lucky son of a bitch. -Sure I am.
Noisy bitches!
Why the hell are you barking?
Oh, Billy from IN?
Your friend is damn lucky.
But you and me seem out of luck.
Wanna show me what you got, bitch?
I’ll see you outside.
Who is that?
Such a kickable face.
Yad, a local stray.
From Central Ladprao and picks fights with technical boys?
Yeah.
How do you know him?
At the juvie.
I fought with him there.
Don’t mind him.
He has nothing on us.
-Let's have hot pot. -Yeah.
Your treat, Lupin.
Yeah, your turn.
I have 20 baht.
Jerk.
Hello?
Where are you?
You are so late.
Lupin could have gone to boot camp.
How was it?
Black ballot.
We gotta celebrate.
Where?
In the hood.
Just come join us, stop asking.
Page Rhang when you get here.
He’ll pick you up.
Rhang is there?
Everybody is here but you.
Just come, stop asking.
Yeah.
I saw Mod too.
Mod who?
I’ll crush him.
Just hurry, Rhang has to rush back to rehab.
What rehab, you idiot?
Let me talk to him.
Hello, Da.
Hurry up.
See you there.
All right?
Yeah, see you, man.
Drink up all you want, my treat.
Damn.
Oh, I saw Lupin today.
When I walked out,
I saw Billy and his friends.
So what?
I’m just telling you.
You know Billy, don’t you?
Yeah, I know him.
We became good friends in juvie.
But they are always the INs, aren’t they?
And I am the one who slashed him.
But I’m a CHOL,
I know what you are thinking.
But to me, friends and institute are as important.
Billy was there so you didn’t want to fight?
I was gonna go after Da,
Billy and I would settle things later.
You were there, weren’t you?
You know what happened.
Yeah, I understand.
I’m kidding. Don’t think too much.
We did the right thing that day.
It would be despicable if we fought them.
Da was on his knees crying,
who would want to hurt him?
But I won’t spare him next time.
Where’s the restaurant?
I don’t have that 20 baht anymore,
already spent it on cigarettes.
-You are always like this. -Lame.
-This one. -My parents don’t give me money so often.
They say the hot pot is really good here.
There is a jukebox too.
I told you it’s the best here. All kinds of music.
-Hit songs, Grammy… -Sony.
Sony, Grammy,
RS, FourS, they have it all.
Bakery too.
-Come on. -Do you have two baht?
Put some music on.
Do you see that, Billy?
Hello.
A table for three?
Please come in, please.
Seeing their faces made me lose my appetite.
They should put our feet in their mouth rather than the meal.
Agreed.
They should rather eat our feet.
What now, Billy? Go somewhere else?
Order,
one grilled beef.
Whiskey, two waters, one bucket of ice.
Calm down, Lupin. Keep it cool.
Leave now, we're losers.
They’ll talk crap about us.
What are you gonna do?
Clear up.
How?
Don’t know.
Jerk.
Your order is coming.
Here.
Rhang, get me the whiskey.
Oh,
let me drink with you guys.
About that night.
Looks like we’ll have a hot pot with feet.
That sounds yummy.
You might have watched too much Dreams Come True.
Coming here wishing to drink with us?
I’m not as generous as Mr. Traipop.
What do you want me to do?
If you want to drink with us,
make a drink for us first,
are you okay with that?
Which one is your glass?
Straight? Mine is.
That's good.
Straight, pure with nothing else.
Just like your heart.
It's okay.
Thanks to you guys.
Wait.
You finished your drink, let me make another one.
Thanks, man.
What did you talk about with them?
Grilled beef is coming.
I thought you’d get in a fight.
I was so prepared.
-To fight? -To run.
That was nothing.
They asked about what happened at Au’s house.
They must have understood.
Quite a big heart they have.
I thought they would beat you up.
No, it’s over.
Lupin.
Give me the money you extorted from kids.
Damn, Rhang!
You are desperate for two baht?
I want some music on.
How can you afford drugs
when you want two baht from me? Here.
I quit.
Quit buying?
Quit taking.
Fine then.
Are you sure you can find them?
Of course.
Trust me, I got red ballot today.
My hands need blood. Either IN or CHOL.
So, what’s next?
Stop talking, ride on.
Okay, got it.
Just tell me, just tell me one thing
Why you have changed?
About me Upset and crying because of you
It's just your imagination
Damn.
I'M IN FRONT OF DISTRICT OFFICE, DA
Da is here.
I’ll pick him up.
Let me come along, I miss him. Let’s go.
You stay here with Billy.
No. Where are you picking him up?
District office.
I won’t be long.
Okay.
Get me some drink.
Cheers.
I nearly got drafted, you know.
Luckily I didn’t.
There is a hot pot shop ahead.
Let’s go check it out. They might be there.
All right, let’s go.
Da.
-Damn. -I’ve missed you.
I could have attacked you back.
Are you all right?
Yeah, how about you?
You look the same, same long hair.
Have you waited for long?
Not at all.
And you, are you drunk?
I’m good. A little tipsy.
Who chose this song?
So spot on.
Sorry, Oh.
That son of a bitch, Billy, stabbed JR at the concert,
you stay out of this, alright?
Billy, you son of a bitch!
What?!
Scumbag!
-You scumbag! -Why did you slash me?
-Mod, please. -Oh!
Mod, stop. Please!
If CHOL means something to you…
Stay out of this!
Scumbag!
Hey!
This is my day.
Don’t you want to fight now?
INs and CHOLs?
Aren’t you so great?
Now that you got my little bee show.
Weren’t you so gritty before, huh?
Even Thai Life Insurance can’t help you.
And you, look at what you did to me.
You want more?
Huh?
And you,
you think you are a CHOL?
You are a CHOL?
Huh?
What?
I can’t hear you.
How is it running into my bullet?
Does it feel good? Does it?
Of the three of you,
who do I shoot first?
Do you wanna know who I shoot first?
Huh?
I'll tell you who I shoot first.
Who do I shoot first?
Shoot you?
Do I shoot you?
Or you?
I know.
I’ll shoot you all at the same time, scumbags!
Scumbag!
You dirtbag!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Da!
Don’t worry, Da.
I promise…
I’ll take a good care of your child.
After Da died,
I adopted Amm to be my daughter.
Amm lived with Da's mother from then.
How did Da’s mother die?
She was killed by drug addicts.
They have no relatives.
Billy took Amm in.
We all have to help with the expense.
Billy,
I’m sorry
that all of this happened.
Why are you apologizing?
It’s been a long time.
All because we were so wild.
I feel guilty because of that.
That’s why I became a teacher.
It’s just a moment in time.
I believe that everybody goes through rough times.
What matters is how you act upon them.
That’s why I am to blame.
Society despises me.
My daughter despises me.
What’s this?
Why are you drinking with my dad?
Did you force my teacher into this?
Dad.
If I knew what you had planned for the parents’ meeting,
I could have taken a motorbike taxi.
Inthira,
stop talking to your dad like that.
Do you realize what you have just said?
I do.
I always know what I’m about to say.
Do you have any idea why I am like this?
I’ll get some more ice.
How was the parents’ meeting?
I was so embarrassed
when my friend asked where my dad graduated from.
Damn.
He went to a technical college.
Who’d want to say that?
Yeah.
Is graduating from technical college that disgraceful?
I’ll call you back, Ter.
Do you have any idea what I have been through?
I know what you have been through.
Do you know the man you are drinking with
is not my real father?
Yes.
I was there when your dad died.
There is never a day that your dad and I in more pain…
than about that awful mistake we made.
I am sorry
that I am a part of that tragedy.
I’m so sorry.
Sorry?
You say sorry and does that make my life better?
Or will my dad come back to life?
My apology can't make your life better
or bring Da back to life,
but do you know that it’s Billy
who has been taking care of you?
Yes, I know.
I knew all along.
Let me fly with you.
I saw that he came to visit grandma all the time.
Hello, Mom.
When I was a kid,
he always gave my grandma money. It was for me.
Always brought along many things
and played with me,
made me smile.
He taught me to do my homework
and even did it for me.
He played guitar just to put me to sleep.
But I didn't sleep.
After my grandma died,
he took me in and raised me.
He took me to Aunty Peaw's restaurant.
He and Uncle Lupin took me to play games.
But what I never knew was,
I never knew if what he has been doing for me…
is because he feels responsible
or because he loves me?
You know, he never remembers anything about me.
He can’t even remember my birthday.
He doesn’t know what my favorite food is,
or what I enjoy doing.
He only knows when my real dad died.
When the school was established.
He drinks all day,
only cares about work,
wallowing in the past.
Dad, I really want to know.
Do you love me
or do you just feel responsible?
Amm.
I’m sorry.
DEDICATED TO EVERY SOUL THAT MY FRIENDS AND I WRONGED
I told you to stick to just one thing.
Now it’s all mixed up.
Think you are tough, huh?
Told you to take ketamine,
and you took two things.
Let it out.
The mall will be closed, no more buses.
I’ll have to find a way to get home.
You are such a burden.
How is it?
Get up, scumbag. Get up.
Anytime he is drunk, my shoulder hurts.
I wouldn’t complain if it was a girl.
He’s so heavy.
Put down the spartan sword.
or you’ll get to taste my Beretta.
I can shoot the three of you
like playing Tic-tac-toe, schmucks!
If I put it down, you’ll shoot us anyway.
Stop talking back to me.
You forked tongue.
I said put down your sword.
Quick!
Six rounds left, I definitely won’t miss.
Come on!
Now!
We're the BUs from Bang Na No one bats an eye
We're…
You have some grits, scumbags.
Go and find some Baihor bitter pills for your friend.
But what if it does?
[photographers] Paul! Paul!
[reporter] A few words, Paul, Paul…
-[horn blares] -Wait! Hey, wait, that's my scarf! Stop!
Hi, beautiful.
Hi, you. You look great.
Oh, thanks, thanks.
-Paul! -Paul! Right over here.
-Two seconds. -Okay.
Hi, how you doing? Good to see you again. How are you? Thank you so much for coming.
-[woman] A few questions. -Hang on a second. Hang on.
I'd be nowhere without this amazing woman and brilliant writer in her own right,
my book editor, Madeline Kelly.
-Maddie, come here. Come here. -Oh.
This is our night, Maddie. You and me, we did this together.
You wrote a great story, Paul. I just helped you polish it up.
Save me a moment inside, will you? I have something I want to talk about.
-What is it? -You'll see.
-Okay. -Okay.
-[reporter] Quick question. -Hi, Jay.
So, was there a particular lady in your life that inspired the love story?
Well, come on, you know, I can't give away all of my secrets.
-[laughs] -[cell phone rings] -[Paul] Always good to be back. -[Jay] Yeah? Another bestseller?
-[Paul] Always good to be back. -[Jay] Yeah? Another bestseller?
Hello?
-[woman] Oh, Maddie. -[Maddie] Hi, Mom.
-Glad I caught you. -[clicking] [Maddie] What's that clicking noise?
I'm trying to order toilet paper online.
The students keep stealing it,
and the button on my keyboard keeps getting stuck.
Too much detail, Mom.
Well, you asked.
It's a little hectic here.
I got stuck in traffic, and I just literally got to the venue.
You're gonna be late for your big night. It's bad time management.
I wish I could've been there to help you.
-Okay, Mom, can you hang on a second? -[Rosemary] Of course.
Yeah, just one second.
Okay, go ahead.
I was calling to see if you've had that talk with Paul.
to see if you've had that talk with Paul.
Not yet. I hope you haven't told anyone about my feelings for him.
-[blows air] -Trust me. No one in Des Moines cares.
Well, Heather and Emma don't even know. You didn't tell them?
[Maddie] I'm just-- I'm not ready.
If your friends don't know,
it's entirely possible that Paul doesn't either.
No, I've given him plenty of signs.
You should see the way he looks at me when we work together.
-Mom, he gets me. -Well, you're in love with him.
-Why don't you just tell him? -I may not have to.
Oh. What's happened?
He says he has to talk to me about something.
-Really? -So tonight may be the night.
Ah! It works.
Okay, Mom, I have to go.
All right. If he doesn't tell you how he feels about you tonight,
you gotta speak up. That's all I'll say.
-Okay, love you. Bye. -[Rosemary] Love you too.
-Hey, girls! -[both] Hi!
This is so exciting.
We are so proud of you.
-Thank you for coming. -Oh, where's the scarf I gave you to wear?
-Somewhere in Brooklyn by now. -How'd that happen?
Freak accident. I totally get if you never wanna loan me anything again.
Don't worry about it, Mads. That scarf was a sample from work.
Heather, great job on the cover art.
You like it?
It's stunning. What do you think, Emma?
-I think you've been holding out on us. -On what? Paul?
Yeah, you've been working with him for over a year.
Don't tell me you haven't noticed.
I think he's an amazing writer. That's all.
You should have your name on the cover with him.
-You practically wrote the book. -No, I didn't.
-You practically wrote the book. -No, I didn't. I mean, not exactly.
Besides, it's good for my career.
Paul's talking me up to the publisher.
-He's Irish. -Yes.
-Does he have a sexy accent? -Haven't noticed.
-Is he single? -Give me that.
-Okay. -Where are you going?
To find Paul.
Come on, Maddie. Don't wimp out now.
Here you are.
Thought I'd use a little liquid courage before going in to face the masses.
They're gonna love it. It's a beautiful story.
Well, I have you to thank for that.
If I had my way, the lovers would have tossed themselves into the lake by chapter ten.
You're amazing. You know that?
You balance me out, Madeline.
We do make a great team.
We do, which is why I wanted to talk to you
about something really important to me.
-You know you can tell me anything. -Well…
I feel like it's time
we take our relationship to the next level.
Oh, Paul, I don't know what to say. I feel exactly the same way.
[Paul] Really?
-That's wonderful. -[giggles]
So,
will you work with me on my next book?
I want to bring you in from the conception of the story.
I know you wanted to write your own novel. I can help you with that.
But do you think it could wait just… a little longer?
Oh, I, uh…
-Sure. -Great!
-Sounds great. -Wonderful!
-Yeah. -Well… [sucks teeth] Right, time to feed me to the wolves.
Right, time to feed me to the wolves.
See you in there.
Well, if you stop moving, I can grab it.
[laughing] Just get me to the bathroom.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?
We're just having a minor eyelash malfunction.
May I offer my assistance?
Oh, uh, yeah. Maybe. They're the new NanoGrip lashes.
I'm a stylist at Bergdorf's.
I get the latest samples of all their luxury cosmetics.
-This one gets a thumbs-down. -[laughs]
-Do you mind if I give it a go? -[Emma] Sure.
[Paul] I'll be very, very careful.
There.
How's that?
Much better.
Hate to break this up, but you have a lot of people waiting for you.
-Okay, well, after you. -Oh no, after you.
"She peers up from the watery depths."
"If only he would reach out for her,
it could break the spell."
"But instead, he turns his back."
"She calls out with drowned words
as he disappears into the shadows of the mossy glen."
"Chapter eight."
"The first night she spent alone was the worst."
TWO IRISH HEARTS PAUL KENNEDY
There you go, Gertrude. That's a beautiful name, by the way.
Thank you, Paul.
-So, how did you three meet? -Oh, we're friends from school.
I was always a big reader.
What? [whispers] That was me.
-Would you like me to sign your book? -Oh, uh, yes, I would.
Of course.
-Here we go. -[Emma] Is that a real lake?
Yes. It's in Ireland. It's not far from my family's home.
Hmm, well, I'd love to see it sometime.
And I would love for you to see it sometime.
You write such amazing stories. I could listen to them all night.
-[both laugh] -Wow. Wouldn't that be great?
Unfortunately, Paul has press in the morning, so…
Check, please.
-It's an open bar. -No, it's not.
It was amazing. [Heather] Yes.
This might have been the most incredible night of my life.
You and Paul seemed to hit it off.
I know, it's like we had this immediate connection.
Well, you can't take it too seriously. Paul's a famous person.
-He's used to making people feel special. -Well, he signed my book.
He signs a lot of books.
With his phone number?
It's just a phone number. It's not like it's a proposal.
I can't believe Paul and Emma are getting married.
It all happened so fast.
Like whiplash.
Welcome to Ireland.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
Nearly there. You've got one more bag. Oh Paul, that one's mine too.
-There you go. -Did you bring enough luggage, Em?
I'm getting married.
You won't believe the number of wardrobe changes I'm gonna need.
Excuse me. Ma'am.
-[Heather] Mads. -Excuse me.
-[Heather]Are you okay? -Sure.
Maddie, have you got your bag?
Almost.
-We'll meet you out front, okay? -Okay.
If you need me on that job, I'm available at a moment's notice. Okay?
Good. All right. Yeah, of course. Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
-Oh. -Oh, sorry. This is mine.
[chuckling politely] Uh, no, I'm afraid it's mine.
-No, actually it's mine. -Hang on a minute.
-No, actually it's mine. -Hang on a minute. There's an American woman trying to steal my bag.
I'm not. I'm trying to take my bag.
If you just look at the tag, you'll see.
I don't need to. I know my own bag. So let go.
I'm not letting go of my bag.
See? Look, my favorite plaid skirt.
Are you sure those are your size?
I'm so sorry.
It's quite all right. It could have happened to anyone.
Although I suspect it happens to you more often than most.
-Enjoy your visit. -Hmm.
LOST LUGGAGE
[Paul] Ah, Maddie. There you are.
We finally managed to get all of Emma's bags into the car.
I may have to ride on the roof.
-Can't believe this is actually happening. -I know. How are you feeling?
No cold feet, right? Me? Never.
I can't thank you enough for introducing me to Emma.
You've changed my life, and I'll never forget it.
[clerk] Can you please fill this out?
Looks like this is gonna take a while. -Why don't you guys head to the house? -No. I can't leave you here.
-Why don't you guys head to the house? -No. I can't leave you here.
-Don't worry about me. I'll take a taxi. -Okay.
Call me, let me know everything's okay.
Good.
[sighs] "No Ubers in the area." Great.
Can you go to this address? Oh, yeah. I can take you there, love.
-Okay. -Yeah.
[man] Whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait!
Billy. Oh, good to see you again.
Couldn't convince anyone else to give you their bag?
As a matter of fact, my bag is missing, but they'll call me when they find it.
Well, if you're in need of boxer shorts, you know who to ask.
So, you're a photographer?
I am.
A nature photographer.
Well, at least I'm trying to be.
It's a little trickier now the whole world carries a camera in their pocket.
Never thought about that.
-What brings you to Ireland? -A wedding.
-Oh, congratulations. -Oh, no. It's-- it's not mine. [chuckles] It's my friend's.
Maybe you'll be lucky to catch the bouquet.
[scoffs] What makes you think I wanna get married?
Nothing. It was a joke.
Apparently, a bad one.
TWO IRISH HEARTS
-Thanks. -All right. You enjoying that?
Yes. Have you read it?
Nope. Don't need to.
-I barely made it through his last one. -[scoffs]
Paul Kennedy's one of the best-selling authors in the UK.
They sell a lot of fish and chips too. Doesn't mean they're any good.
[exhales] Well, he seems to be doing very well without your approval.
Not a friend of yours, is he?
[driver] Your stop coming up, Miss. Kennedy House.
As in Paul?
Well, that answers that question.
-[Maddie] Thank you. -No bother, love.
Oh, and, FYI, I edited this book.
Oh, and, FYI, I edited this book. So, what do you have to say to that?
My deepest sympathies.
You know what? You can just go--
Hey, you.
-You're trespassing, you know. -Uh, I'm sorry.
-You're trespassing, you know. -Uh, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm looking for Paul Kennedy.
I know who you are. Just having a bit of fun.
I'm Kory, the brother.
-Hi. -Come on, everyone's inside.
Oh, Maddie! You made it!
Yeah, I took the bus, which was fine,
except for the cheeky English guy I had to ride with.
-Olivia, this china is divine. -[man chuckles]
You have an excellent eye. It's Belleek.
-Oh. -It's been in the family for generations.
Just this way. [chuckles]
Oh wow.
This place looks like a fairy tale.
Except around here, if you lose your shoe at midnight,
you're just drunk.
[whispering] He's so cute.
-[Emma] Wow, really? -I've got Maddie here. Fresh off the bus.
-Hey, Maddie. -[man] Good.
-Sean. Paul's dad. -Hi.
-Oh, no! -[tense music builds]
Um, I'm so sorry. [chuckling] Quite all right. -No damage done. -Yes, sir.
Have they found your luggage?
-No, not yet. -[man] Come join us.
Oh, Mads, I'm sorry.
[Maddie] It's okay.
It was insured.
It's not the bag we're worried about. It's the bridesmaid's dress.
Without it, you'll imbalance the look of the wedding party.
Maybe she could stand-off to one side. You know, like a cheering section.
Right! The car is loaded up.
Madeline. Everybody about ready to go?
-[Heather] Oh yeah. -Where are we going?
Paul's planned a surprise trip for us all. Isn't he sweet?
-Just give me a sec to get changed. -Mm-hmm.
Such a lovely young woman.
She's adorable.
Madeline, you must be so thrilled for them both.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
SCRUFFY MURPHY'S PUB & INN
[man] You all right? Good.
Afternoon. How are we, chaps?
That looks good.
[laughs] There's the world traveler. Good to see you, Murphy.
Doing well? How's it going?
Oh, fine, fine. So, are you around for a week this time?
I am. Yeah, I'm covering the sheep-shearing festival.
Oh, there's great excitement around here for that one.
[chuckles] I'm sure.
Now Fionnuala is getting your room ready,
and you can use my old Triumph while you're here.
No, no, no, no. I can't take your car.
Look, you can trade me with one of your fancy photographs.
And I'll hang it up in the pub.
-All right, deal. -[Murphy laughs]
You're still liking it?
All this gallivanting around the world?
Snapping pictures of lizards and birds, huh?
I am.
[Murphy] If you don't stay put,
how are you going to find a nice woman to settle down with you?
I'm not sure I'm cut out for settling down with anyone.
What am I telling you for? You've never listened to me anyway.
-Good to see you, man. -All right.
Beautiful.
Hey! You need anything? I can lend you some clothes.
-No, I'm good. I had a sweater in my bag. -Okay.
-Gorgeous view. -Yep.
Is everything okay with you? You seem a little off.
Yeah. No, uh, I'm good. I'm great.
Why don't we have a girls' night? We can go out, get a couple drinks,
Why don't we have a girls' night? We can go out, get a couple drinks, meet some guys.
You haven't dated in almost a year since you started writing that book.
-Just say yes. Come on, come on! -Yes.
Thank you. I'll see you downstairs in 15.
-Happy couple taking us on a picnic. -Ugh.
Thank you.
-I'll take the basket. -Lovely. I'll take the heavy thing. Right, follow me. Let's have a picnic.
Right, follow me. Let's have a picnic. [Maddie] It's so pretty here.
[Paul] This bridge was used by the Vikings.
[Emma] This must be where you get all your creative inspiration.
-[Paul laughs] -Look, it's Lough Tay. -It's the lake from Paul's book. -Ah.
[Heather] Oh, it's beautiful.
Is this where your mystical fairy lives,
in a sunken city at the bottom of the lake?
-Yeah, exactly. You're so perceptive. -Except she's not mystical.
She's wicked and selfish, and she lures men to their watery deaths.
-Maddie! -No, that's right. -Evil fairy. -[all laugh]
[Paul] Anyone fancy a boat trip? -[Heather] Oh! -[Kory] I do.
-[Paul] Nevin put some boats aside for us. -[all laugh]
-Maddie, come on, we can squeeze you in. -Oh, it's okay.
There's plenty of room. It'll be fun.
-I'm just gonna go for a walk. -Really? Okay.
-Are you sure? -Yeah.
-Could we get a picture? -Oh, okay.
-[all] Cheese! -[Maddie] Woo-hoo!
How about one of Paul and I?
Here, use my phone. That way, I can post on my stories later.
Okay. Uh, one, two, three.
-[Kory] Think the water's warm? -Here you go. Thank you, Mads.
-I am so excited by this. All right, have fun.
-[Kory] See you later. -Enjoy your walk.
-[Heather] And we're off. -[Emma] Oh, it's lovely.
[Heather] I'm counting on you.
Bye, guys.
-See you, Maddie! -Bye!
-Hi, Mom. -You promised you'd call when you landed.
Sorry. I am safe and sound.
Actually, Paul took us to Lough Tay. It's really magical in person.
Is there something in your voice? Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay, but…
I can't help but think that things would be different
I can't help but think that things would be different if I'd just taken your advice and told Paul how I felt.
[Rosemary] Sweetheart, think of this as a lesson learned.
You're gonna have to start speaking up for yourself.
Stop that.
[Maddie] Yeah, well, it's too late now.
It's not like I can tell Paul I wish he was marrying me instead of Emma.
-[static] -Maddie? -Mom? -Maddie? Maddie?
-Mom? -Maddie? Maddie?
Mom, it's…it's reconnecting.
Mom?
Was that a wish you were making?
Oh, no, I was just, um…
I mean, I guess, but I didn't think anyone was listening.
Well, I was.
Look down.
Okay.
They call that a wishing chair, but you have to do it right.
So, sit down, close your eyes and make your wish.
Oh, no, I'm good.
What are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid. I just-- I don't believe in that kind of thing.
Well, then you have nothing to lose. Oh, come on. Why not give it a go?
Okay, I wish--
No, you have to do it right. Sit down.
Close your eyes and mean it.
[sighs] Okay, I wish…
I wish I was marrying Paul Kennedy.
[chuckling] Well, that didn't work.
Didn't it? And how can you tell?
Isn't there supposed to be an earthquake or a lightning bolt or something?
So you want something more theatrical?
Let me see if I can muster up a stiff breeze. Would that help?
That would be nice.
-[shower running] -That was a weird dream.
Hello?
Hello?
Heather? Emma?
Are you in there?
[gasps] Paul!
Ah, Maddie, you're up. Can you hand me a towel?
Uh, sure. Yeah. Okay. Um…
Um, Paul, what are you doing in here? Taking a shower. What does it look like? Have you seen my beard balm?
Taking a shower. What does it look like? Have you seen my beard balm? No!
What's wrong with you?
[Maddie] Nothing, I just, um-- I didn't know you were in here.
-Where else would I be? -Right. Okay.
Oh! Uh, I'm-I'm gonna go. Right. So sorry.
Whoa! Oh!
Maddie! Are you all right?
-They found my suitcase. -[Paul] Come here. -Huh! -[grunts]
You know what? I'm gonna go outside. I'll just-- Yeah, I'm gonna get some air.
-Oh, morning, Mads. -Hi, Emma.
Emma! You're up early.
I'll get a run in before breakfast. Have you seen Paul?
-Paul? -I've been looking for him everywhere.
You know, you can get lost in this house.
Yeah, well, uh, he is definitely not in there. At all.
-Right. [chuckle] -You know what? As a matter of fact, I haven't seen an inch of him anywhere.
-What? How did he get in there? -[Emma laughs]
-Morning, Emma. -[Emma] Morning.
-Your mother's looking for you downstairs. -Oh. Great, thanks.
-I'll see you at breakfast? -Whoa. Paul.
What? It's not like she's never seen us kiss before.
Nevin, my jacket.
So, uh, getting ready for the big day, huh?
You must be getting excited.
I'm looking forward to the reception.
There are some seriously hot men in this town.
See?
-Oh. Hey, are you-- -I need to talk to you.
What in the world, Mads? What is wrong?
I'm gonna tell you something,
but you cannot breathe a word of this to Emma.
Oh. All right.
Last night, I had the craziest dream.
We were by the lake, and this odd lady told me to make a wish.
And I wished that I was marrying Paul Kennedy.
-I know that probably shocks you. -Should it?
Well, anyway, when I woke up from the dream, my suitcase magically appeared,
when I woke up from the dream, my suitcase magically appeared,
and Paul was taking a shower. In there!
[chuckling] Okay.
Isn't that a bit weird to you?
And there's a wedding dress in my suitcase! Uh, yeah.
-Why is it in there? -Because it's yours, silly.
You and your mom picked it out in New York.
What?
Yeah, and in a couple of days,
you're gonna put it on, walk down the aisle, and get married!
No, I'm not! Yes, you are.
I think you're having a little pre-wedding anxiety.
-Perfectly normal. -I mean, what are these?
-Perfectly normal. -I mean, what are these? These aren't mine.
Girl, sexy heels for your honeymoon.
No. I am not the one who's getting married.
She is!
[Heather] Exactly.
You, my friend, are marrying Paul Kennedy.
Now, just breathe. Relax.
This is gonna be the best weekend of your life.
Get dressed.
I'm marrying Paul Kennedy.
Yes!
I'm marrying Paul Kennedy!
Whoo! Yes!
-Okay, so-- -Well, I just don't understand it.
Why can I not find a photographer for this wedding?
-Because you're horrible, Mum. -[Paul laughs]
The last two photographers you hired for our parties left in tears.
-Did they really? -Yes.
They did. They were crying and everything.
Oh, there she is.
-Good morning, everyone. -[all] Good morning.
Uh, darling?
Allow me.
Thank you.
-Are you feeling all right, Madeline? -Yes. Just a little jet-lagged.
Have some champagne. It's working for me.
Thank you.
Try these local woodland strawberries. They're delicious.
Let me give you one. Very good.
Madeline, would you like a boxty?
A what? [chuckles nervously]
Oh, she's so adorable. Um, it's an Irish pancake.
Oh, okay, thank you.
Sean, I meant to tell you. The bakery called.
The wedding cake we ordered is too tall for the delivery truck.
-Oh, no. -Could you get a smaller cake?
[Kory] Very good.
-I like your thinking. -[Olivia] Well done, dear.
[Sean] Finally, someone with some sense.
Well, the weather seems to be holding up. You fancy a bike ride this morning?
-Oh, with me? -Mm-hmm.
-Of course with me. -[both laugh]
Emma and I are going down to the orchard to pick some apples.
-Kory, do you want to come with us? -I can't. I've got rugby practice.
Paul, can we go pick apples?
I'm not really that coordinated on a bicycle.
Don't be silly. Everyone knows how to ride a bike.
Sweetheart, can you pick up the pace a little?
Paul, I'm trying.
[Heather] These are so luscious.
-[Paul] Maddie, you still back there? -I'm coming.
-Oh, hey. -Hi, ladies.
Hey, Maddie.
-Maddie, are you okay? -Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.
-You all right? -Yeah, I'm okay. I'll just hop back on.
I don't know, you kind of look like a liability on that thing.
Oh, no, I'll just push it and trot along next to you.
Well, I was kind of hoping to get some cardio in, babe.
-It's okay. I'll take it from you, Maddie. -No.
Could use a bike ride. I'm low on my steps.
-All right then! -Alright. -Quick little trip around the village? -Only if you can keep up with me.
-Quick little trip around the village? -Only if you can keep up with me.
-Whoo! -[Paul] Them fighting words.
[Emma] Yeah, left you in my dust!
[Paul] I'm gonna get you.
-So, want to pick some apples? -[sighs] -Yeah, sure. -Okay.
[Heather] I literally cannot believe we got so many apples.
How about we make an apple pie for Kory? Maybe he likes a girl that can bake.
There you are. I've been looking for you everywhere.
Madeline, do you realize what time it is?
We have an appointment at the tailor's for the fitting of your wedding dress.
Oh, but don't I already have a dress? My mom and I picked it out together.
Oh, speaking of your mother.
Nevin will collect her from the airport and bring her to the rehearsal.
-My mother's coming? -Better late than never.
[Emma] Yeah, I agree with you.
I don't see a problem with guys using Botox.
Right? I mean, I don't need it now, but maybe in the future.
Oh hey, Em.
-[Emma] Hey. -Hi.
Paul, darling, I thought you told Madeline about the wedding dress.
I did.
-Right, honey? -No.
Well, anyway, come on.
-Well, she's no fun. -My mom can handle her.
[Olivia] It fits her like a dream.
[Liam] Spectacular.
Magnificent.
-Wow. -Wow.
My grandmother wore that gown on her wedding day.
So did my mother. So did I.
It's a tradition in our family, Madeline.
It's really… fun.
"Fun"?
It's vintage Lanvin.
It is a fashion artifact. It is the sphinx of wedding gowns.
Maybe you could add a slit?
[James] Brilliant. They have it.
THE NEW BESTSELLER FROM PAUL KENNEDY
-Hello. -Hello.
-Let me get you this. -Thank you.
-[computer chimes] -Oh! Congratulations. You are our 100th customer of the week.
Oh. Wow.
Which means you win
a promotional copy of Paul Kennedy's new novel.
-That's okay. It's fine, thanks. -But it's free.
-[chuckles] -Even so.
There you go.
-Little gift. -Of course.
-One of this. -Lovely.
Oh, and the payment. There you go.
-[cell phone chimes] -Perfect.
-Have a good day. -You too. Bye.
SHEEP SHEARING FESTIVAL
CANCELLED
-After you. -Thank you.
WEST COAST RARE BOOKS
Oh, come on. You've got to be joking.
I was looking forward to that gig.
-It's really not that bad. -Yes, it is. What are you talking about?
-What are you gonna do about this, Maddie? -Well, I'm just gonna wear the dress.
Because it's only a dress and because Paul wants me to.
[woman] And because you wished it.
Did you just hear that?
[gasps] There she is. That's her! She's right there. There she is!
Who? Maddie!
Hey, wait, come back!
What does that mean? I'm happy with my wish.
[woman] Are you really happy with your wish?
[Maddie] Where are you going?
I love my wish. Come back! Please don't take it away!
Hello.
-It's you. -You all right?
-You didn't see me crossing the street? -Well, yes, but you ran into me, so…
-Well… -There you go.
It's okay. I got it.
-Here. -Oh. Well done.
Hey.
You told me you didn't like Paul's books.
-Sorry, what? -When we were on the bus.
[laughs] I don't mean to be rude, but do I know you?
You don't remember?
-Oh, that's because it didn't happen. -[James] What didn't happen?
-Nothing. -[Emma] Maddie!
-What was that about? You just ran off. -I, um, I saw--
You found one. A photographer. Wonderful. Well done, Madeline.
No, I…
Olivia Kennedy. And you are?
James. James Thomas. Lovely to meet you.
I don't suppose you're any relation to Paul Kennedy, the author?
That's my son.
-Ah. -[Olivia] This is his bride-to-be. -Of course you already knew that. -I didn't, actually.
-Of course you already knew that. -I didn't, actually.
The thing is, James is not that kind of photographer.
How do you know that?
-You're a photographer? -[James] I am.
What would you charge?
I appreciate the offer, but I don't think I'm the man for the job.
What do you mean?
I don't really photograph people.
Whatever your fee is, I will triple it.
When did you say the wedding was?
You see how there's this beautiful glow around the bride and groom.
-It's lovely. -That's what I'm looking for.
Something ethereal.
And then any photographs of me should be taken from the right.
That is my better side.
All right.
Whose car is in the middle of the drive?
Hey.
Oh, good, darling. You're just in time.
Madeline found a wedding photographer for us.
Oh! James Thomas, this is Paul, my fiancé.
-I've read some of your work. -[Paul] Oh.
-It's always nice to meet a fan. -Yes, I'm sure it is.
You know, my publicist said
that we should get some PR pictures after the wedding
of Madeline and I in some idyllic Irish backdrops.
He thinks it'll help boost my sales figures.
So not just a wedding but a good PR event too.
Yeah, exactly.
[Olivia] Especially since Maddie is Paul's book editor.
Why don't the three of you spend tomorrow driving around the area?
-You might find some great spots. -That sounds wonderful.
-What do you think, Paul? -It's a great idea. -10:00 a.m., James? -Sure.
-10:00 a.m., James? -Sure.
Madeline, would you mind showing James out?
Sure.
So you're not just his fiancée but his editor too. How convenient.
If you're gonna spend the day with us, can you leave your snark at home?
Since I don't technically have a home, I don't know where that would be.
I'll do my best.
I suppose I should be thanking you for the job.
I don't mind saying it's gonna come in very handy.
Now that the world has a camera in their pocket?
It's what I always say.
Really?
Yeah.
-See you in the morning. -Yep.
Guess what? You are marrying Paul Kennedy.
Oh! Yes!
-What the-- -[thud]
-Paul? -Maddie! What the hell?
I'm sorry! I was asleep! God, that hurts.
I didn't… It was a knee-jerk reaction. Did I get you in the eye?
You got a bit more than the eye.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?
Don't-- Don't touch me.
-Okay. -Okay?
-Yeah. -Oh.
I'm so sorry.
Are you sure you're okay?
-[Paul] Oh, I'm tickety-boo. -[Maddie]. Okay.
-You're doing a grand job, mate. -[man] Thank you.
Ah. Morning.
Where's Paul?
Uh, he's not coming.
Well, why not?
He had a little late-night injury.
He said we should scout locations.
-Nothing serious, I hope? -Oh, no, he just needs the ice.
-What about your friends? -Uh, they're getting mani-pedis.
Ready?
So how did you become an editor?
Oh, well, I was a freelance writer, but that wasn't really paying the bills.
-Then I got a job at the publishing house. -Ah, so that's how you met Paul.
Yeah. He wasn't really clicking with any of the other editors,
and we were a good fit right off the bat.
That's interesting.
What does that mean?
I guess opposites attract.
Excuse me, Paul and I are not opposites. We have many things in common.
I stand corrected. I'm sure it's a long list of mutualities.
Why don't we stay silent for a second? That way I can enjoy the view.
As you wish.
DES MOINES, IOWA
-[Maddie] How about you? -[James] We don't need to talk about me.
-Nice view though. -[Maddie] Where are we going?
-This is so pretty. -Oh, it gets better. Come on.
So… I've got to ask.
Do you have to?
-[chuckling] Go ahead. -Okay.
Why don't you write your own book?
I've been trying, but it's been a bit difficult lately.
Because you're too busy working on Paul's book.
No, I just…
-I'm not sure I have anything to say now. -Everyone has something to say.
They just have to be brave enough to say it.
-Are you calling me a coward? -Absolutely not.
-You came up with that all by yourself. -Okay. [laughs]
[James] Right. Well, Paul said he wanted some authentic Ireland.
[James] Right. Well, Paul said he wanted some authentic Ireland. So, this is about as authentic as it gets.
So, this is about as authentic as it gets.
[Maddie] Wow.
It's the Cliffs of Moher.
-You know it? -I've heard about it.
-What do you think? -[camera clicks]
I think I just stepped into a James Joyce novel.
That's not the reference I was expecting.
Joyce is my favorite author.
Is he?
Hey, you're pretty good. [chuckles]
Thank you.
Unfortunately, I don't think a rugged cliff is Paul's style.
No. No, probably not.
But is it yours?
-Yeah, I think it's beautiful here. -Yeah, me too.
[sighs] I'd love to get married up here.
Why don't you?
Because the wedding is this weekend, and I don't want to be difficult.
I'd hardly call having a voice at your own wedding being difficult.
Sorry, I just like to know a little bit about my subjects
Sorry, I just like to know a little bit about my subjects before I photograph them, that's all.
I thought you didn't photograph people.
I'm willing to make an exception.
-Wow. -[Finn] That was awful.
This looks like fun.
Heather, Emma. Come meet my mate, Finn.
Hi, I'm also Paul's groomsman. Nice to meet you.
Paul, what happened to you?
Well, it's a long story.
I'm trying to minimize the damage. -Look. -[gasps]
Do you think it'll show in the photos?
I have an amazing concealer you can borrow.
That'd be great. Thanks.
[Finn] Heather, I was talking to Kory about the big wedding aisle walk.
Should we all practice, so we can make a splashy entrance?
I've got my eye on you, Finn.
-He's trying to steal my spotlight. -I got moves, Paul. I ain't gonna lie.
Oh, no one could steal your spotlight. Can I get you some more ice?
No, no, no. Stay here and entertain me. Stop me feeling sorry for myself.
Are you always so thoughtful?
Not with everybody.
Lucky me.
[James] There's a storm's coming.
We should probably get you back. I'm sure you got lots to do.
Not really. Paul's mom has already done everything.
Where's your mum in this whole equation?
In Des Moines, but she's flying in for the rehearsal dinner tomorrow.
-I'm sure you'll be happy to see her. -It'll be great to get her here.
-I'm sure you'll be happy to see her. -It'll be great to get her here. She knows how to handle these situations. It'll make everything easier.
She knows how to handle these situations. It'll make everything easier.
-Should-- -Give me a hand with that. Yeah.
Just pull.
Holy mother of God!
-This is intense. -You know what they say about Ireland?
If you don't like the weather, just wait five minutes.
Mark Twain said that.
That is a really big tree.
[James] Yeah, it is.
And this is the only road out.
-There has to be another way around it. -If we had a Hummer.
I'll have to turn around. It's okay. I know a lovely little pub we can go to.
Wait, really?
-[James] Come on. Come on. -[Maddie] Ah!
-[James] Get under. -Thank you.
Let's go.
It's a good pub, this. It'll be worth it.
Wow. This is a fun place.
They do the best fish and chips in Ireland here.
-I thought you didn't like fish and chips. -What makes you think that?
-I thought you didn't like fish and chips. -What makes you think that? Well, you said…
Never mind.
James Thomas, you bastard.
O'Callaghan, you swine.
-[laughs] -How are you, buddy? Yeah. What brings you here?
Well, there's a tree down on the road, so we're stuck.
Oh, right, I heard, yeah.
Seamus is gonna see to it first thing in the morning.
-But he's a little cabbaged now. -[both chuckle]
In that case, we'll need two rooms for the night.
Whoa, wait, we can't spend the night here.
Well, do you fancy sleeping in the car?
Just give me a second.
[Paul's voice] This is Paul Kennedy. I can't get to the phone right now.
-Who's that lovely creature? -Calm down.
Don't tell me you finally convinced some young lady you're worth a shake.
Hey, Paul, it's Maddie.
Uh, a tree fell down in the middle of the road, and so we are stuck here.
Her name is Madeline Kelly, and I'm photographing her wedding.
-Her wedding, huh? -Now, now.
Looks like I'll have to spend the night. Call me when you get this.
Okay, I left a message.
Good. Let's eat.
-Ah, take a seat. -Okay.
How about a couple of stouts?
Oh, can I have a white wine, please? I don't really drink beer.
Ooh, I wouldn't say that too loud around these parts.
-You'd get locked up for treason. -[all laugh]
-He seems great. -Yeah, he's great.
Tom and I go a long way back.
I've been coming to Ireland since I was a kid, so it holds a very…
special place in my heart.
Is it true that you don't have a home?
This week it's a rented room above Scruffy Murphy's.
After, I'll be on the road traveling the world
with nothing but a camera and a passport. ♪ Different situations ♪
Doesn't that get lonely after a while?
I mean, it's…
There's a freedom, having no ties.
Well, maybe you haven't found that person to spend the rest of your life with.
Like you did?
Do you play darts?
Not recently.
Let's play now.
Here we go.
It's all about grip, stance, and confidence.
-You don't like to talk about yourself. -What makes you say that?
You keep changing the subject.
You're supposed to keep your feet on the floor.
You see what I mean?
This time, just try your stance like this.
Only your arm moves.
You're a man of mystery.
If you keep talking, you won't visualize hitting the target.
-That was sneaky. -I'm not sneaky.
Maybe it's the luck of the Irish then.
Or maybe it's just you.
-I mean, you're a good coach. -Well, you're a good student.
I'm getting married in two days.
Right.
-Your drinks. -Oh.
And your rooms.
-Lovely. Thanks, Tom. -Enjoy.
Thank you.
-You want to try it? -Uh, sure.
Not bad.
-One dance before we call it a night. -[laughs] Okay.
I'm sorry. I need to get by here.
It's a family emergency. I got to go. Please. Please.
Yeah, you're done. You're done.
Thank you. Bye.
Hi, I've been standing in line all this time at the wrong counter,
and I've missed my flight.
So I need you to get me another one immediately.
Principal Kelly. It's me, Allegra.
-Oh. Yes, hello, Allegra. -Hi.
Well, I need to get to Ireland. My daughter's getting married.
-Maddie's getting married? -Yes. I'm pressed for time.
I missed my flight to Dublin. So see if you can you find me another one.
Then I need a connection to Knock airport. That's in West Ireland.
Sure. How did you miss your plane?
A clock malfunction.
You overslept. That's crazy.
There was a power outage, and my backup phone alarm just…
-What are you doing? -I'm texting Kimmy.
Remember her from detention? She's gonna freak out.
-Seriously? -Yeah.
-[laughs] -Somebody help me.
Please, help me!
Let's go.
WILD HEN INN
-[engine chugging] -Come on, please start. Please. [Tom] Mm-hmm. Nope, nothing.
I can't believe this. I'm gonna be late for my own wedding rehearsal.
Could be water in the carburetor.
-We could try a rolling jump. -What's that?
You two push. I spring the clutch.
-Sure. Okay. -Yeah, great.
All right, ready?
-[James] Mm-hmm. -Okay!
Push!
Success!
Ah, crap.
I'll get a rag.
-[exhales] -That'll do. A rag.
[Olivia] Well, no sign of Madeline.
First, her mother misses the flight, and now here we are waiting for the daughter.
-I hope this isn't a family trait. -You couldn't make it up.
[Heather] I'm sure Maddie will be here any minute.
I mean, those trees can be a huge challenge,
and we don't even know if they had a chain saw, right, Em?
and we don't even know if they had a chain saw, right, Em? Yeah, right.
I can't believe you didn't bring a phone charger.
-Neither did you. -[sighs]
Does this car go any faster?
-No. -Great.
-It's not funny. -It's pretty funny. It'll be fine. Look.
Look at that.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today
to celebrate the love of these two fine, young people who--
Hold on, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.
Close call, Maddie. You almost lost your place.
Come here. Come here.
Oh. Sorry.
-What happened to you? -[Maddie] Well…
Uh, I'm afraid I'm to blame.
We were coming back from the Cliffs of Moher.
What were you doing in that tourist trap?
How did you get all muddy?
Well, we're all together now, and that's what matters.
Mind if we cut to the chase?
We have guests are arriving at the rehearsal dinner in an hour.
All right then, let's skip to the good part.
You may now kiss the bride.
[Maddie] James?
What?
Who's James?
That'd be me.
What happened?
Well, you fainted.
It's her.
It's who?
Saint Brigid?
She's the one who made all this happen.
-Do you think she's been at the whiskey? -Sean, please.
-Must be the stress of the wedding. -Need water?
No, I'm just, uh… I just feel a little dizzy, that's all.
-Are you sure you're okay? -Yeah, of course I'm okay.
I'm marrying Paul Kennedy.
That's right.
Shall we continue?
Of course, Father. Sorry.
[priest] Where were we?
-[clinks] -[Olivia] Quieten down, everyone. My darling husband, Sean, has the floor.
Thank you, darling.
May your hearts be light and happy.
May your smiles be big and wide.
And may your pockets always have a coin or two inside.
No worries there, Maddie. You're marrying a Kennedy.
-Sláinte! -[all] Sláinte!
-You're drinking Guinness now, Maddie? -I'm acquiring a taste for it.
All right, now in honor of the happy couple,
we're gonna play a game of "How Well Do You Know Your Fiancé?" -[all] Oh! -[laughs]
Three questions. If you get them right, you both take a shot.
Mm-hmm. [Kory] If you get them wrong, we all have to drink a shot.
We have to drink no matter what? Can we play a different game?
Oh, no, you're not getting out of this. Kory's making the rules.
All right, first question. Who is Maddie's favorite author?
[Emma] Oh, that's an easy one.
Paul Kennedy.
No. Very good. Very good, no.
No, my fiancée likes the classics. Her favorite author is…
[whispering] James Joyce.
…Charles Dickens.
[sighs] That's right.
One point for the happy couple.
Question two. What is the song you first danced to together?
-Well, there wasn't one. -Mm!
-Maddie doesn't know how to dance, do you? -[all laugh]
Nope. [chuckles]
We've heard enough from you, brother. Last question is for you, Maddie.
Where did Paul propose to you?
-[Olivia] She knows that answer. -[Kory] Tell us anyway.
-Propose? -[Finn] Yeah.
You know, how'd you get the ring on your finger?
Well, go on, Maddie. Tell them.
Well, it was in this really special place.
Really special.
It was so, so special and…
Right, wasn't it? It was really beautiful and special.
It was at O'Toole's in Brooklyn on my birthday.
Exactly.
-It was. It was at O'Toole's in Brooklyn. -Mm-hmm.
-On your birthday. -On my birthday.
And then…
Well, and then Maddie looked at me,
and she said, "What would it take for you to bring me to Ireland?"
And I said,
-"We'd have to be getting married." -[laughter]
And then…
Then…
Oh, she's only messing.
Then you got down on your knee, and you proposed to me.
I proposed?
I mean, yes, of course. Yes, I proposed. Me.
-I. Yes, I proposed. -You. [laughs]
And the rest, as they say, is history.
-You all right? What's the matter? -Foot's hurting.
Come on.
Excuse me.
James, I thought I might take a look at those.
I think it might be better if you stay tonight.
I've asked Nevin to make up the tower suite for you.
Nevin. Lovely.
-I'll see you in the morning. -Fantastic.
-Thank you for today. -Of course. Thank you for having me.
Are you leaving already?
No, no, no. Just packing up my stuff for the night.
Olivia has me staying in their guest tower.
Sounds very posh.
I don't think she trusts me to make it on time tomorrow after the tree incident.
Thank you for taking me to see the Cliffs, and for the dance.
I'd like to think of myself as a full-service photographer.
Is it everything you imagined?
-What? -This.
All of this.
You seemed confused in there, like you and Paul didn't know each other.
That's ridiculous. Of course we know each other.
-Charles Dickens? -Anybody can make a mistake.
Yeah.
I hope you're not making one too.
You don't get to say that to me.
We barely know each other. We spent a day together.
I admit it was a beautiful day
filled with dramatic vistas and romantic rain,
but that doesn't give you the right to question my life choices.
Tomorrow, I'm marrying Paul Kennedy.
Because you asked him.
Wait, so… so what? You don't think a woman can ask a man to marry her?
Of course not.
But if you were my girlfriend, I wouldn't have waited.
I'd have asked you first.
You know what? Maybe you shouldn't come to the wedding.
I'll tell Olivia then.
-Fine. Take the photos. -Fine. It'll be the last you see of me.
After this job, I'm off to Bolivia to photograph an endangered tree lizard.
-What? When do you leave? -Sunday.
Great. Right on time to keep running from your own life.
I shouldn't have said that.
A bit late.
Mom?
-I got a flight. We're about to board. -[Maddie] You did?
-That is great news. -I'll be there in time for the wedding.
But don't pick me up. I'll take a taxi.
Okay. Mom, I'm so happy you're coming. -I really need to see you. -[Rosemary] I'll be there soon.
-I really need to see you. -[Rosemary] I'll be there soon.
I'll make sure your wedding to Paul is absolutely perfect.
[Maddie] Thank you, Mom.
[announcer] Gate change announcement. Flight 47 to Dublin will now…
What did they just say? Hold on one sec, honey.
Where's everyone going? What's happening?
-I gotta go. Bye. -Mom? Mom?
Coming through. Coming through.
Phew! Hi.
Hi. Uh, looks like you're having fun. Emma's a good dancer, huh?
Yeah. Hey, maybe she can give you a few pointers for tomorrow.
Oh, I almost forgot. I wrote our vows. I emailed them to you.
Wait, uh, you wrote my wedding vows?
Maddie, I am a writer.
But maybe you can spruce them up a bit, huh?
Paul, can you come here for a sec?
Oh. I'm being summoned. You coming?
You know, I think I'm gonna head to bed if that's okay. I'm pretty beat.
Okay, well, I'm staying in the guest room tonight.
Wouldn't want any bad luck before the wedding.
-No. Wouldn't want that. -[both laugh]
-Good night. -Good night.

HERE YOU GO BABE! WEDDING VOWS BY PAUL KENNEDY
-[Emma] This was an amazing night. -[Paul] It was.
[Emma] Yes. I wish it could have gone on forever.
[Paul] Yeah, me too.
-Good night. -Good night.
[man] Those flowers go in the chapel.
A perfect morning for a wedding.
Did you get a good shot?
I think so. Yeah.
Um, haven't you got a wedding to get ready for?
Yeah, I'm just taking a moment.
I'll leave you to it.
James. I'm really sorry about last night.
No apologies necessary.
You've had a lot going on.
-I read your book. -You mean Paul's book.
-I read your book. -You mean Paul's book. I know what I said.
It's better than his other books.
A lot better.
Wonder how that happened.
I didn't change all that much.
-Why do you do that? -Do what?
It's one thing to edit a book,
but you shouldn't go on editing your own life.
[Maddie] I'm not editing my own life, I just…
I know this might sound strange,
but I'm not sure this is supposed to be my life.
If that's the case, then now is the time to speak up.
Is this what you really want, Maddie?
Is Paul really the person you want to share the rest of your life with?
Marrying Paul is my wish come true.
Okay.
Then why are you so sad?
Right this way.
Your veil is spectacular. You look amazing.
Well, this is it. I can't believe it's all happening.
Me neither. Can you do me a favor and see if my mom's arrived?
-She's not answering her phone. -Yeah, absolutely. I'm on it.
Okay, thank you.
Hi, Father.
Are you ready, Madeline?
Uh, I guess so.
-You guess? -I'm just…
Father, I think I've done something wrong.
What is it, my dear?
I made a wish to Saint Brigid.
Is that all? You have to be careful with that one.
She's known to have a bit of a sense of humor.
Oh. What does that mean?
Well, when you ask her for something, she may not give you what you want,
but she'll always give you what you need.
Oh, that's my cue.
It's all going to work out just fine. I'll see you out there.
Oh! It's starting.
Ah! Are my eyebrows even?
That makeup artist Olivia hired has serious 'tude.
-And I think I pissed her off. -You look great.
-I'm sorry, Em. -Hmm?
About what?
You and Paul.
What are you talking about?
I know you two have feelings for each other.
I saw you on the patio last night.
Nothing happened.
I've known you since we were kids, Em. It's all right. You can tell me.
[whispering] Maddie.
Do you believe in fate?
Sometimes.
See, I don't know why,
but from the moment I met Paul,
it just… it just felt like we were supposed to be together.
In another life, maybe we would have been.
Just not this one.
I can't believe you're taking this so well.
This is your big day, and I'm ruining it.
It's not your fault. Really.
I'm gonna try to make things right.
Excuse me.
-Hi. -[Paul] Stop, stop, stop.
-Hello. -[woman] Is that the dress?
-What's going on? -Oh, dear.
What's she wearing? Where's the family wedding dress?
Hi, there.
Um, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Maddie. The bride.
Or at least I was supposed to be.
Of course, uh, you know Paul.
He's a really great guy, and a good writer too.
People often tell me that I need to speak up for myself.
So, here it goes.
I really care about Paul…
…but I'm not in love with him.
And I'm pretty sure he feels the same way about me.
Maddie.
[Maddie] I just think that if you're gonna go through with something like this,
like a wedding, and a marriage, and a life,
that it should be with someone you love, not just someone you wish for.
It should be with someone you find,
or even someone who finds you.
I'm sorry. This is unacceptable!
Paul, how did you let this happen?
Me?
It's all his fault.
-The photographer? -I saw you with Maddie this morning.
At the lily pond.
Wait, what about you and Emma last night on the patio?
Oh, that's irrelevant. This joker is trying to steal my bride.
At least I'm not stealing Maddie's ideas and calling them my own.
-What are you talking about? -Your latest book.
Well. [scoffs]
I wrote that book.
No, you didn't. I wrote that book.
And there you have it.
-[guests gasp] -Paul, stop.
No. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Come here!
No! Stop. Let go of him.
Maddie, this is not helping.
Paul, stop it!
-My leg. -Oh!
[Olivia] Sean, don't just stand there! Do something!
-Come on, son. You got this. -[grunts]
-Steady does you. -Who's that?
-[Kory] Leave my brother alone! -Mom? Where are you?
Don't panic, but I am in the hospital in Des Moines.
-What? Are you all right? -[Rosemary] I'm fine.
I've just got a fracture of the metatarsal
and a little bump on the head, but I remember everything now.
Honey, tell me. The wedding. Was it everything you ever dreamt of?
[Paul] Kory!
Not in a million years.
Why are you not getting him? Help me! Help me get him.
Get off my foot! Get off!
What's wrong with you? What?
Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back.
James!
Who are you helping?
Paul. Are you hurt?
No, I don't think so.
I can't believe you called me irrelevant.
What?
I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry! Come back!
Oh my God.
Let's keep him out of this.
James.
Wait, James.
I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have stayed on this job. I've become too emotionally involved.
-You have? -You heard Paul in there.
He thinks I'm responsible for all this, and if I'm being honest, I probably am.
You're not.
If I ever made you doubt yourself, then I am truly sorry.
-But-- -The best thing I can do is just…
walk away from you.
But none of this is your fault.
I really wish you all the happiness in the world.
I can't be happy without you.
I know this doesn't make sense right now,
but I believe in my heart that we're meant to be together.
Not like this.
James, stop!
-Goodbye, Maddie. -[gasps]
Okay, I'm here!
I know you're here, Saint Brigid. You can come out now!
Please! This was all a mistake.
Paul, the wedding, James.
Just take it back!
Saint Brigid!
There's no need to shout, dear.
I'm right here.
I need to unwish my wish.
I'm afraid that's impossible. That wish has already been granted.
But everything has gone horribly wrong.
Has it? Or has it gone exactly as it was supposed to?
No, you're right, and I've learned my lesson.
I have to live my own destiny.
Well, then, that's different.
Wait, come back. Where are you going?
Please, Saint Brigid, let me unwish my wish!
Okay.
Okay. I can do this.
I just need a little wind.
Where's the wind? Okay.
Okay, just a little breeze. Give me something.
I'll take anything you got. Okay.
Just take back my wish!
Is anybody in here?
[gasps] What are you doing?
-Why aren't you dressed? -That's a bridesmaid's dress.
Uh, yes, and it's supposed to be on the bridesmaid.
-The ring is gone. -What ring?
That's Paul and Emma.
Is everything okay?
This is amazing! Ah!
I'm glad you think so. Let's get moving.
-Hi, Mom. -[Rosemary] Sweetheart.
Oh, how's your foot?
My foot? Oh, you mean my arthritis.
Oh, that hasn't acted up since I've been using that glucosamine.
-That is such good news! -[Rosemary] Aw.
Thank you, honey.
James?
Oh, sorry.
Right. Here we go.
Thank you.
Whiskey, please.
-Great reception. -Yeah.
-[bartender] Here you go. -Thank you.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
[Heather] Okay, fine. He's not into me.
I'm moving on.
-Good for you. -Thank you.
Champagne, please.
-Well, hello, handsome. -Hi.
-Fancy a dance? -Oh, yeah. Sure.
All right. Say less.
-Hey. -Hey, having fun?
Yeah, it was a beautiful ceremony. And you got to wear your own dress.
Wouldn't have happened without you.
Look, Maddie, I spent my whole life looking for someone like Paul.
I couldn't be happier for you.
Oh, there's the photographer. Is my lipstick still on?
It's perfect.
There's my girl.
Congratulations, Paul. Emma is an incredible person.
-You're lucky to have her. -We're all lucky.
I just got off the phone with the publisher.
The US numbers are huge. They want a sequel right away.
Now obviously, I'm going on my honeymoon for a month,
so do you mind starting the story without me?
That depends.
On what?
Am I gonna get co-writing credit?
Madeline, that's not how it works.
I get the sole credit.
You edit the story,
and my name sells the books.
That's why we're a perfect team.
You know what, Paul? That's not how a team works.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to fly solo on this one.
Where are you going?
To write my own story.
Enjoy that.
-Thank you, Murphy. -Sláinte.
What can I get for you?
Hi, I'm looking for James Thomas. He's renting a room upstairs.
James? He's left. You just missed him.
Oh. I did?
-[Murphy] Maybe you'll catch him. -Okay, uh, thank you.
-You're welcome. -Thank you so much.
[Maddie] Is this seat taken?
Um, depends if you'll try to steal my bag again.
-Thanks. -It's okay.
-Well, this is a coincidence. -It's a small village.
-So you're a nature photographer, right? -Mm-hmm.
I was wondering if I could get your advice on something.
All right.
I'm doing some research on the Bolivian tree lizard.
They're endangered, you know.
I've just been offered a job in Bolivia to photograph that lizard.
-When are you leaving? -Well, I'm not. I turned the job down.
You did?
Well, just after you got off that bus,
I, uh, met this very interesting woman
who encouraged me to stick around for a while.
See what might happen.
How long are you gonna be in Ireland for?
As long as it takes.
I'm planning on writing a book on the Cliffs of Moher.
Do you know them?
One of my favorite spots.
Mine too.
Maybe we could go there together sometime.
I'd like that.
What's the book about?
[Maddie] I have this crazy idea.
-[James] Fancy something to eat later? -[Maddie] I'd love that.
[James] I know a lovely little pub we can go to.
[Maddie] Can we play darts?
Absolutely.
There's even live music.
-[Maddie] Do you dance? -[James] Yes. Yes, I do.
Like, so differently.
His name is Miles Morales.
He was bitten by a radioactive spider.
And he's not the only one.
He hasn't always had it easy.
And he's not the only one.
And now he's on his own.
And he's not the only one.
You think you know the rest.
You don't.
I thought I knew the rest, but I didn't.
I didn't wanna hurt him.
But I did.
And he's not the only one.
[Glory] Hey!
Yo, Def Leppard!
Gwen!
Is the song over? -Seems over. -[Glory] Are you okay?
-Seems over. -[Glory] Are you okay? You don't hang out, and you don't wanna talk.
I didn't join a band -so I could talk about feelings. -I did.
-so I could talk about feelings. -I did.
I joined it so I could hit my feelings with sticks.
Yo, if you don't tell someone what's going on, -you're gonna snap. -I'm fine.
-you're gonna snap. -I'm fine.
That's not how someone who's fine would say that.
They'd say, "Great. Thanks. How are you?"
-I'm great. Thanks. -Whoa!
How are you?
Fine?
Gwen. Come on.
-I don't get you, man. -You're right!
I play drums.
I always wanted to be in a band.
Guess I just never found the right one.
In this line of work,
you always wind up a solo act.
Before Miles... -How many did you take? -...there was Peter.
-I think you look great. I don't know. -Is this that dangerous menace?
No, no, no. She seems like a good guy.
Why wear a mask if you've got nothing to hide?
All right, no politics at the dinner table.
Thank you, May.
But they didn't really know me.
-And I didn't really know him either. -[grunts]
-Touch him again, Ned. -[Peter] Gwen, it's okay.
[Gwen] Until it was too late.
-[woman] Hey, Gwen. -Hey.
[Gwen] Peter?
[Gwen] What? No.
No, no, no.
What did you do?
I just wanted to be special.
Like you...
Gwen.
-[Gwen] Gwen? -Don't worry.
[Gwen] Who's Gwen?
Everything's gonna be okay.
Don't.
-Everything's gonna... -Don't go.
Oh, Peter.
-[George] Hey, hey! Hey! -[gun cocks]
Peter?
[Gwen] I never really made another friend after that.
Except one.
But he's not here.
And there's no way to get there.
[Jonah] Pressure mounts as Captain George Stacy leads the manhunt for Spider-Woman.
Who is she? And why won't she show her face?
Peter Parker, an innocent young man...
Peter Parker, an innocent young man... I've known May and Ben Parker for 12 years.
Peter Parker ate at my table.
He was my daughter's best friend.
And I will not rest
until I find this Spider-Woman.
Hey, hey, hey. How's the band?
Uh... Uh, yeah, great. I quit so, you know...
Uh... Uh, yeah, great. I quit so, you know... -You did, huh? Okay. -...thumbs up.
We, uh-- We caught a break in the Spider-Woman case.
That's good.
We're close. I'm telling you, I can feel it.
[Gwen clears throat] Me too.
[sighs] It'll be good for us.
Don't be so sure.
She killed your friend.
-You don't know that. -What do you mean? I do know that.
-I was there. She ran from the scene. -Maybe she didn't have a choice.
-I got a job to do, Gwen. -It won't bring him back.
Uh, I don't wanna argue about this, okay?
Yeah, I can tell.
Say, uh...
too punk rock to give your old man a hug?
[woman 1 over radio] All units, possible superhuman event.
-Guggenheim Museum. -Oh. Hey, this could be it.
Suspect is Adrian Toomes. Also known as the Vulture.
-So I'll see you later? -We don't know the full scale
-of the threat yet. -Cool.
Uh, I'll call. I love you.
[woman 2] 49-20, on scene.
We're gonna need all the help we can get. It's a real mess down here.
This is Captain Stacy. I'm five out.
I need you to look alive. Good chance our girl shows up.
Yuri, explain to me how a guy with a 40-foot wingspan
just waltzed into the Guggenheim unnoticed?
Hey, it's New York. Everyone's got their thing.
-Do we know what he wants? -Do you speak Italian?
-Uh, I'm an Irish cop. -Maybe you love pasta or something.
Everybody on my signal!
-[officers yelp] -Look out for signs of Spider-Woman!
Hey! [grunts]
Yup, we got our sign.
[in deep voice] How's the manhunt for me going? -[muffled] You're under arrest! -Good to know!
-[muffled] You're under arrest! -Good to know!
[in normal voice] Vulture!
-Screaming their name usually works. -[yells]
I guess that worked.
[in English] I am the Vulture, the pinnacle of man's genius.
You're not my Vulture. What are you, made of parchment?
-What cursed world have you brought me to? -[unsettling music playing]
[Gwen] You're glitching, huh? Been there.
-Uh, where you from, bud? -I am an artist, an engineer.
Oh, great. A Renaissance man.
Ooh, let me guess.
You were having an espresso
in some old-timey Leonardo da Vinci dimension,
and suddenly a portal opens up and you wind up here.
-[lively music playing] -[groans]
-Am I warm? -Yes, that's pretty much it.
[Gwen grunts] Sidebar, uh, maybe you could stop making a mess of the art museum for no reason?
-You call this art? -We're talking about it, aren't we?
-[man] Oh, that's cool. -[Vulture yells]
[Gwen] I mean, it's more of a meta commentary on what we call art,
but it's also art.
Oh, look. It's your cousin.
[Gwen] I wouldn't play with fire, dude. You're kind of made of paper.
-[laughs] -Oh, no.
I'm sorry. Who exactly are you supposed to be?
It's classified.
-You're the Blue Panther. -No.
-The Caped Blusader? -No.
-Dark Garfield. -Stop.
Macho Libre.
I'm from another dimension.
You are? Wow! Actually, I'm not confused.
Wow! Actually, I'm not confused.
-My name is Miguel O'Hara. -[dramatic music playing]
I lead an elite strike force dedicated to the security of the multiverse--
-Actually, forget it. -[music stops]
Can you go to any dimension you want with that watch thing?
-It's much cooler than a watch. -Okay. Sensitive.
There is a big flying turkey from the Renaissance I have to bring to justice, so if you don't mind...
I have to bring to justice, so if you don't mind...
[Miguel] It's all right, kid.
I'll take it from here.
[Gwen] Okay, knock yourself out.
[Miguel] Why are you saying it like that?
-[grunts] You're not funny! -[Gwen] Eh, I don't know.
[Miguel] Been really fun cleaning up your shocking mess, by the way.
[Gwen] What mess? -[Miguel] Kingpin's collider. -What are you guys talking about?
-[Miguel] Kingpin's collider. -What are you guys talking about?
-You shut up. -None of your business. Nosy. We saved the multiverse.
We saved the multiverse.
[Miguel] You left a hole wide enough for guys like him
to randomly get shot into the wrong dimension.
Now I'm stuck putting everybody back where they belong
before all of time and space collapses.
And don't even get me started on Doctor Strange
and the little nerd back on Earth-199999.
[Gwen] Who's Doctor Strange? Sounds like he maybe shouldn't practice medicine.
-Sorry, captain, can't talk right now. -Hey! Hey!
[Gwen] So you want me to handle this one or...?
Huh. Okay.
[in English] He's got hammerspace!
[Miguel] LYLA, can you please, you know...?
-Nah, you gotta say it first. -[sighs]
-Call for backup. -What?
-Call backup. -Come on.
-Please just call for-- -I already called her.
-Agh! -But I enjoyed that.
Spider-Woman.
Me too.
Are you, uh...?
Oh, this?
We don't know the sex yet. My husband wants it to be a surprise.
[laughs] He's really corny. But so hot.
Will you adopt me?
-What? -What? What?
[Miguel] Guys, can we focus on the big, fire-breathing threat to time and space, please?
-Yep, yep, yep. -[Gwen] Right.
-What about her? -No.
-We could use the help. -No.
-'Cause she called you Dark Garfield? -No.
-Do you say anything but no? -No. Yes.
-Why not? -You know why.
[in English] Enough of this.
Take a good look at my Greek fire from my backpack.
[Miguel] Don't let him out!
He'll disrupt the canon.
-[man] Go to the ground. -Will you get out of here?
[man] We have you surrounded.
-[Miguel] But I'm a good guy. -[man] You don't look like a good guy.
[Miguel] You're just gonna have to shut up and trust me. No!
[man] Mayday! Mayday! We're hit!
Clear the building!
[man] Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.
That's what I was gonna do.
-[groans] -Hands in the air!
Captain, come on.
-Suspect is armed. -With what? I'm out of webs.
Get down on the ground.
Which is it? Hands in the air or get down on the ground?
-You're under arrest. -I just saved a bunch of people!
-For the murder of Peter Parker. -Come on.
-You have the right to remain silent. -You don't understand!
[George] You don't understand.
Dad.
I've thought about telling you. But you can see why I didn't want to. You can see why I didn't wanna tell you.
But you can see why I didn't want to. You can see why I didn't wanna tell you.
I didn't murder Peter.
I didn't know it was him. I didn't have a choice.
How long have you been lying to me?
Can you just not be a cop for a second and be my dad here and listen to me?
Do you really think I'm a murderer?
You're in this to help people, right?
Right?
Well, so am I.
And the way to help right now is to listen to me.
Please, Dad.
You're all I have left.
-You have the right to remain silent. -What?
Anything you say can and will...
Dad, are you really this afraid of me?
-You have the right to an attorney. -Dad, stop!
Don't get any closer.
Hey! What--?
-Dad! -Hey, hey, hey. Come on.
Just breathe.
We got you. Right, Miguel?
LYLA, scan this mess.
No further anomalies.
Canon remains intact.
[Jess] We can't just leave her here. She's doing this on her own.
I don't know how to fix this.
[Miguel] Yeah.
Well, join the club.
[woman] I know he's just a sophomore,
but we wanna get a jump on the college conversation, so...
I'm sure he's gonna be here any minute.
He's very serious about his future. [chuckles]
-Excuse me, do you have an ATM machine? -Around there in the back.
Preferably not chained.
-[Lenny] What? -[Spot] Nothing!
This should be simple enough.
Just make a hole...
grab the money.
Nope. That's not right.
Just get... Uh-- [grunts]
Give me your money.
Where are you, money? Where are you?
Come here! Oh! [grunting]
[man] Hey, who left this ATM on the sidewalk?
-Yo, what you doing back there, man? -Nothing.
Nothing. Everything's cool, man. It's all good.
-Just forgot my PIN number. -Get out of here!
-No! Sir! Let me rob you! -I'm going to rob your spotted face.
-No! Sir! Let me rob you! -I'm going to rob your spotted face. [Spot] No reason to bring wood into this.
I've never robbed anybody in my life. Please don't make this a bad experience.
[Lenny] "Bad experience"? I run a business here.
[Spot] I'm like Robin Hood, if he gave to himself.
Oh, wow, is this curry powder? See, I'm a scientist. Or I wa-- I am.
Anyway, you've heard of Alchemax? I used to work there.
I was considered handsome by scientists' standards.
I had a little accident. [yelps]
[grunts] Give me my foot!
Oh, man.
I'm so sorry. First of all, I'm not even robbing you. This machine doesn't even belong to you.
First of all, I'm not even robbing you. This machine doesn't even belong to you.
-Belongs to the bank, the real criminals. -You're the criminal. You're robbing me.
You know, I can't really get a job anywhere anymore, being like this.
So I've turned to a life of crime.
-Why do people say "ATM machine"? -[Spot] Huh?
-Who said that? -The M stands for "Machine."
Spider-Man! [yelps]
Hey, Lenny, how much do I owe you for this beef patty, man?
Spidey, if you catch him, it's on the house, brother.
-This is real! -So are you, like, a cow or a Dalmatian?
I am...
...the Spot.
-[laughing] -We meet again, Spider-Man.
-That's funny to you? -Of course not. No.
So is that a costume?
Unfortunately for both of us, this is skin.
Oh, dang.
[Spot] You see... -I'm from your past. One year ago-- -[dramatic music builds, then stops]
-I'm from your past. One year ago-- -[dramatic music builds, then stops]
-[cell phone buzzes] -Hold up. -Oh, come on. -[Miles] Uh-oh.
-Oh, come on. -[Miles] Uh-oh.
-This has been fun. -Who you talking to? -But I really gotta wrap this up. -Are you gonna be a while? 'Cause--
-But I really gotta wrap this up. -Are you gonna be a while? 'Cause--
Maybe just pay me now.
[Miles] Okay, let's do this one last time.
-My name is Miles Morales. -[lively music playing]
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.
And for the last year and four months,
I've been Brooklyn's one and only Spider-Man.
And things are going great.
-Hey, hey, hey! -[people scream] You could hurt somebody.
Catching all sorts of bad guys.
Let's go. [Miles laughs, then grunts] Oh!
Can't you act like a regular supervillain so I can catch you?
I designed my new suit with some fly ambience down the side.
Aunt May moved to Florida.
Done.
I guest-hosted Jeopardy!
Endorsed baby powder. Apologized for endorsing baby powder.
I made a mistake.
My mustache came in.
[deep voice] Mustache.
[Miles] And out.
I made another mistake.
Been developing a new twist on my venom thing.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sorry!
How much longer can I keep lying about who I really am?
I hear that new Spider-Man is Puerto Rican.
[laughs] Nah, he seems more Dominican to me.
I mean, would they get it if I told them?
We love you and accept you, even though you have been lying to us for a year.
[Miles] Maybe in some other universe.
Sometimes I just wish I wasn't the only one.
But I don't dwell on it.
I miss my uncle sometimes.
Miles, I see exactly what you're doing there, man.
[Miles] Even though he turned out to be the Prowler.
I try to do what he told me:
Just keep going.
[Miles] "Just keep going."
[Spot] You're looking at texts? This is the fight of our lives.
-Sorry. Just a second. -Okay.
No, no, no. Go ahead. Take the call.
You turn off your phone in a theater, but not when you're fighting me?
[Jeff] Ah! "In a minute."
Ah! He wrote it all as one word. That's cute, right? The youth.
-[Miles] Okay, that's weird. -Whoa!
[grunting] Oh, my nose!
[Miles] Sorry. I gotta be somewhere.
-Psych. -Whoa! [yelling]
[chuckles] There's bubbles now. Hold on.
Whoa!
[Spot yelps] I think this is going great.
Still bubbles on here.
I think it's probably okay.
[Spot] I love it.
We're figuring it out. We're finding our rhythm.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[Spot] Hey, where'd that goose come from? Whoa!
I don't think I want this costume anymore.
Almost there, Mami.
-Smiley-face. Prayer hands. -[Spot] Oh, my God.
Is this your goo--? Get it off me, get it off me!
Is this your goo--? Get it off me, get it off me! -[Spot grunts] -[Miles yelps]
[Miles] At the end of the day...
[Spot] I got you right where I-- Ow!
So aggressive!
...I'm Spider-Man. No one can take that away from me.
[Spot] Unbelievable. Come back to your nemesis!
Don't escape.
Your costume's too tight in the back, by the way.
-Yo, what's up, man? -Uh, I'm writing an essay.
There's a bad guy on the Petersen building.
Call the police, tell them to pick him up?
-Sounds like a slippery slope. -Just this one time.
It starts with one call, then it's walkie-talkies, synchronized watches.
In a month, it'll be a Spider-Signal. I'm not your "guy in the chair."
Are those my Jordans?
I can't help it if we're the same size.
You see, every person is a universe.
And my job is to capture your person's universe
on this piece of paper.
-That's blank. -Exactly.
I have no idea who this kid is.
I don't know if he knows.
He's gotta decide if he's going to commit himself to his future
or whatever he's doing instead of being here.
Can't have your cake and eat it too.
Unless you bake two cakes.
Unless you bake two cakes. -Miles? -Interest in comedy.
-How's this going? College! -Now, son, what do we always say?
"On time means five minutes early."
I know, I know, I know.
I gotta get back to being a great student, so can we make this quick?
[Ms. Weber] Okay.
Miles's grades are pretty good.
A in AP Physics...
That's my little man.
...and AP Studio Art.
He takes after his uncle.
-A-minus in English. -She's a tough grader.
And a B in Spanish.
-What?! -Whoo! Okay.
-Miles! [speaks in Spanish] -Are you trying to kill your mother?
[speaks in Spanish] Eso no es my fault.
"Esto no es my fault"? ¿Tú estás tomando la clase en Spanglish?
I missed a few classes.
Oh, just a few classes. Well, what's "a few"?
[Miles] I mean, you know, like... -Five? -[in unison] Five?!
-Five? -[in unison] Five?!
Actually, six.
-You're dead. -A truant.
-Wait. -[sighs] Takes after his uncle.
-But I just have a lot going on. -All right. We can still salvage this.
I'm sorry, "salvage"?
Miles has a great story to tell.
Having a story at all seems gross.
-Your name is Miles Morales. -Correct.
You grew up in a struggling immigrant family.
I'm from Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is part of America.
We own a floor in Brooklyn. Ah... Struggling? [muttering]
We own a floor in Brooklyn. Ah... Struggling? [muttering] -Doesn't matter. You're all struggling. -I make captain next week.
-Doesn't matter. You're all struggling. -I make captain next week.
Now his dream is to attend the top physics program in the nation...
-Whatever it takes, we'll do it. -...at Princeton University.
In New Jersey?
No, no, no. That's too far.
New Jersey's too far from New York?
There's great schools in Brooklyn.
Mom, Princeton has the best quantum researchers in the country.
Quantum. Mm-hm.
They're moving electrons across dimensional thresholds.
-Electrons. Uh-huh. -They're studying dark matter!
I don't know what any of that means.
I could help figure out how to travel to other dimensions.
-Yeah, okay. -That sounds like a really good fake job.
Dad, when you were my age, you followed your dream
and went out on your own to start a business with Uncle Aaron.
-Right? -That's different. We used to--
-Right? -That's different. We used to-- See, when you were born-- [laughs] Plus, your mom used to--
See, when you were born-- [laughs] Plus, your mom used to--
Look, life is a journey.
You all got me into this school because you thought I could do something special.
-[dramatic, pensive music playing] -And now I think so too.
And the special thing I wanna do is this.
There are people out there
who can literally teach me the things I wanna learn.
But they aren't all in Brooklyn.
That's your story!
Now just stick to the script.
[Jeff] Miles, are you paying attention?
-Miles, pay attention. -[Spot whoops]
-Ow. That hurt my tailbone. -[Miles] Are you kidding me?
Ooh. I gotta go. You guys keep talking. This is all great stuff.
Miles, wait. Did you order the cake for tonight?
Totally. I'm-- You know, call me-- I gotta go, all right? Bye!
This kid. I swear, what are we gonna do with him?
[man] All units, supervillain event in progress.
-I gotta go too. -What? You're gonna leave too?
He leaves, you leave, everybody leaves. Why am I here?
I know. I'm so sorry. But we'll figure it out.
Together.
Wow. Excuse me, I'm so sorry.
-[Ms. Weber] He's lying to you. -Jeff?
Your son.
He's lying. And I think you know it.
How's your essay?
-Marinating. This is part of my process. -Oh? Oh, really?
-I think your guy got away. -Thanks, I'm on it.
-You seem really stressed. -[Miles] I agree.
-You're stretched too thin. -Yeah, thanks for the tip. [yelps]
-That was bad. -[Jeff] I know.
-What's really going on with this kid? -I don't know!
-Oh! Hey! -[Spot] Boom!
-Spider-Man. -[Miles] Officer Morales! I mean:
-[in deep voice] Officer Morales. -[Spot] This is not what it looks like.
-Hey! Hey! -[Spot] Officer-- My kid goes here, man!
My kid goes here, man!
[Spot] This is fun.
I'm on the PTA. You know how many lemon bars I gotta bake for that?
-[Spot] You left in the middle of a fight. -[Miles] I did not. It was at the end.
-[Jeff] Are you serious? -[Spot] It was inconsiderate, super rude. And a little cocky.
Yeah, you got me agreeing with the bad guy right now.
[Miles] "Bad guy"? He's barely a villain of the week.
What'd you call me?
-You realize I'm right here. -Come on!
-[Miles] Everything... -[Jeff yells]
...is under control.
-[Jeff groans] Unbelievable. -[Spot] Wow.
Of course we'd end up back here.
[Jeff] You know, you are just like my son.
[Miles] I am? I-- [laughs] That's so silly. Imagine that.
-[Spot] Back where it all started! -[Miles] Look out!
[Spot] The crucible of our connection!
[Miles] Don't try to wow me with big words.
I do the crossword every day.
-[Spot] Is it all coming back to you? -[Miles] What are you talking about?
[Spot] The creation event.
[Miles] What?
-Yeah. -Hey, we got cut off.
This is our son we're talking about. Nothing is more important than family.
[Jeff yells, then grunts] I'm kind of in the middle of something.
[Spot grunts] Destiny brought us here.
-You see now, don't you? -I really don't.
[Spot] I am your nemesis.
Dude, you are not.
You missed. You can't contain the Spot. Ow!
You really don't remember what you did to me?
-What I did for you? -[Miles] Uh... No.
[Spot] I worked at Alchemax.
I ran a test on this collider
that brought a spider here from another dimension.
-Forty-two. -[man] Its home dimension.
[Spot] It escaped. And it bit you.
My spider made you Spider-Man.
-What? -You ran through the cafeteria.
-He took a bagel! -You hit me with a bagel.
I've hit a lot of different villains with a lot of different food.
[Spot] You make your flippy, little sassy jokes, and everyone loves them.
But no one knows what it feels like to be on the other side of them.
But no one knows what it feels like to be on the other side of them. [in deep voice] I'm just trying to lighten the mood.
[in deep voice] I'm just trying to lighten the mood.
I created you.
You created me.
Spider-Man, why did you create that guy?
I didn't. He's talking crazy.
I was in this collider room when you blew it up!
[Spot] Because of you...
I lost my job, my life,
my face!
My family won't even look at me.
I made you into a hero.
You made me into this!
Look at me! You did this to me!
Look at me! I'll make you respect me!
I am your neme--
Well, where'd he go?
He kicked his own butt.
[Jeff] You know we're supposed to catch the bad guys, right?
[Miles] I always do.
-Usually. -[siren wailing]
-Gutierrez! Get the crane, man. -[Gutierrez] Yes, sir!
-Gutierrez! Get the crane, man. -[Gutierrez] Yes, sir! [Jeff groans] This here is why nobody likes us, man.
-[Miles] "Us"? -I am trying to do right out here.
-I'm trying too. -You need to be a better role model.
-I'm trying too. -You need to be a better role model. I'm a great role model.
Hey, Gutierrez, you can cancel the crane.
I swear, I'll quit my job!
-Do you wanna talk about it? -Are you crazy?!
Well, men of your generation ignore their mental health too long.
[Jeff] Oh, boy.
What am I even doing?
'Cause no matter what I do, someone always thinks I'm blowing it.
[Miles] I know the feeling.
So your son.
How's he doing? You think he's gonna figure it all out?
-Honestly? -Yeah.
-He's a good kid. -Yeah?
It's scary. He says these things that are so smart.
Cool. Well, I should probably--
And then he does these things that are so stupid.
I just don't want him to mess it up.
Maybe get off the kid's ass.
-I'm sorry, what? -What? What? I don't know.
And I hate that he's not being honest with me.
Maybe he's scared to talk to you.
Why would anyone be scared to talk to me?
I don't-- I don't know.
It's just-- You think you're getting pretty good at being a parent. You think you got it licked.
You think you got it licked.
And then they go and grow up.
I just don't wanna lose him, you know?
Well, as an objective observer with no skin in the game,
I say you gotta let him spread his wings, man.
-Like this. -Yeah.
I don't know.
If this isn't nice, what is?
I should go.
Yeah, and catch that holes guy.
Don't worry. I don't think that guy's gonna show his face again.
[Spot] What?
Okay.
I think I kicked myself...
into myself.
Well, this is new.
Hello? Hello? Echo, echo. No echo.
Hypothesis:
I'm going to put my head in that hole.
-Hello. -[screams]
Ow! Please! Ow, ow, ow!
Stop it, stop it, stop it! [groans]
That was cool.
My holes can take me anywhere.
-Whoop. -[people screaming]
Excuse me. Hi.
-Sorry to bug you. I know you're busy. -What do you want?
I know it's weird. I came out of nowhere.
But I think I'm becoming a transdimensional superbeing.
-So? -"So?"
I'm literally splitting the fabric of space and time.
For you, it's just a Tuesday night.
You're acting like weird stuff like this happens to you all the time.
Can I have some gum?
Wow.
The power of the multiverse in the palm of my hand.
My holes aren't a curse! They're the answer!
Can you stop talking about your holes?
You're making everyone uncomfortable.
No, no, no. You're gonna love this. Look, look, look. [grunting]
[groans] I'm out of spots, wouldn't you know it. Uh...
As you were, gentlemen.
I'm coming for you, Spider-Man!
[man 1] Take this one step at a time.
[man 2] Does anybody have the instructions for this building?
-[ominous music playing] -Oh, no.
Tomorrow morning, Spider-Man, page one, with a decent picture.
-You're right, boss. -Shut up.
-Uh-huh. -Get out of here! You got it, boss. I'm on it.
I need a raise.
[imitates beep] Miguel, it's Peter. We got an anomaly.
Thank you, Peter. You're one of our best.
-Jess, who's on this? -[imitates beep]
-Have you seen Miles? -No.
Nope.
-Have you seen Miles? -[woman speaking in Spanish]
-What are you doing? -[in English] Speech!
-Okay, everybody. -No. I'm terrible at speeches.
Oh, dear God, no.
Rio, come on.
Um... Hi.
[Miles] And I want you to know, no matter what,
even though we've had our ups and downs,
-I'm so proud of you today, and every day. -[woman] Hey.
-Parentheses. Mostly. LOL. -Hey.
-Parentheses. Mostly. LOL. -Hey. Hey, Mr. Spider-Man, it won't fit on one cake.
Hey, Mr. Spider-Man, it won't fit on one cake.
Can't you write smaller?
Can't you write shorter?
Come again!
What else can I say about Jeff?
That he was almost 10 pounds as a baby. I know you're gonna be embarrassed.
He almost killed his mother. Look at those shoulders.
-Oh, no. Okay. That's it. -[Rio] A big baby.
-Okay, okay. -Oh, my God.
He's so funny.
I'll take the mic. No more mics for you, okay?
-Thank you, Rio, for that. -[groans] Where is that kid?
[Jeff] I didn't always know what I wanted to do in life.
I was pulled in a lot of different directions when I was young.
Me and my brother came up in this neighborhood.
Just a couple of knuckleheads running the streets.
It is I, the Armadillo-- [grunts] Oh!
[chuckles] You guys used to chase us out of your stores.
And now, if you can believe it, it's my job to look out for you.
-And then I had a kid. -Stop, thief!
[Jeff] And everything changed for the better.
[Miles] Oh, no.
I don't even know about giving a toast 'cause I should be toasting you all.
No, no, no!
So to my brother, who we miss every single day.
He's definitely up there laughing at me right now.
They're making me captain, bro. [chuckles]
To my wife, mi amor.
I can't even start because I'll never stop.
Have to take the mic from me.
And to my son...
The reason that I do any of this in the first place.
I love you, Miles.
And I will always, always be here for you.
Benny, man. Come on, drop the beat!
[growls] I'm gonna kill that kid.
[man] Hey! Congrats, Jeff! -Hey! Hey, hey. -Thank you for coming.
-Hey! Hey, hey. -Thank you for coming.
-Hey, Miles. Where have you been? -What's up, man?
-You keeping your head up at that school? -[Miles] Oh, yeah, you bet.
Hola, Miles! Hi.
Hola, Miles! Hi. -Your parents have been looking for you. -I don't know why.
-Your parents have been looking for you. -I don't know why. -I've just been here the whole time. -Oye.
-Ah! Hi. -You were supposed to be here at 5.
-Ah! Hi. -You were supposed to be here at 5. -I know. -You disrespected your dad.
-[Jeff] Yup. Mm-hm. -Missed his beautiful toast.
Come on. Did you even see the cakes? There's some heartfelt messages on them.
That's not what I meant.
Your dad studied for eight months.
Nine. It was like giving birth.
-No, it wasn't. -Of course not.
You made us sit in that office and talk to that lady without you.
-There was an emergency. -What, a graffiti emergency?
A partying-with-some-friends- I've-never-met emergency?
Explain yourself.
Sounds like you're explaining it pretty well. -That's funny. Jeff, we got a funny son. -I'm not laughing.
-That's funny. Jeff, we got a funny son. -I'm not laughing.
-I don't feel grown-up. -[in English] Wow, this is a cool shirt.
Okay! Okay, okay. Have you checked out the spread?
-Oye! -Ah! Who you running around with? -Just-- -Is it Ganke? I never liked him.
-Just-- -Is it Ganke? I never liked him. Yes, you did.
-He calls me by my first name. -Ugh. We hate that.
-I have more friends than just Ganke. -Like who?
Well, there's-- There's Peter.
You know, uh, but he left town.
Um, there's-- There's Gwanda.
You know, she also left town.
-Miles, dame un break. -Is that Spanglish?
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe I'm just doing benign, private,
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe I'm just doing benign, private, unremarkable things when I'm not with you guys?
-Nope. -Never. I am 15 years old. I am basically an adult.
-Oh, right. -You don't have a driver's license. -Neither does Mom! -We live in New York
-Neither does Mom! -We live in New York and never plan to leave.
-It's my life. -It's not your life.
It's mine and your father's and your abuelos' y abuelas',
who put you in this spot that I'd give anything to be in.
All right. Whatever, whatever.
"Whatever"? -Wow. -"Whatever"?
-Wow. -"Whatever"?
-Do I get to say it? Please tell me I can. -Say it.
-Do I get to say it? Please tell me I can. -Say it. -You're grounded! -What?
-You're grounded! -What?
-Oh, yeah! -For how long? -A month! -Dad. Mom, are you--? Seriously?
-A month! -Dad. Mom, are you--? Seriously? Yeah, dead serious.
-You don't understand. -You are right.
I have no idea what's going on with you! So why don't you tell me?
-[music volume increases] -Just listen to me!
Okay, champ, you got it. Go for it. Say whatever you wanna say.
What do you got to tell me so bad?
[sighs] You know what? Never mind.
All right, great, walk away.
Because now you got two months!
That was good, right?
Two months.
I'm Spider-Man. I'm not grounded.
[Gwen] Miles!
Miles!
You got a minute?
-[chuckles] -How did you get--?
How did you get--? How have you been?
Uh, I've been good.
I've been-- Yeah, just great. Look at you.
You, uh-- You grew, huh? -Had a little growth spurt? -Uh, yeah. Your hair has gotten pinker.
-Had a little growth spurt? -Uh, yeah. Your hair has gotten pinker.
-Is this the room you grew up in? -It is. Um...
-[lilting, pensive music playing] -But my dorm room is very adult.
Cool. Yeah, no, I used to play with these when I was younger too.
-Uh, that's a collectible. -I used to have this one.
-An extremely rare, highly sought-- -Why is it still in the package? Eee! Um... [laughs]
That's fine.
-Are these your drawings? They're good. -Hey. What? No.
[Gwen] Wow, there's so many.
Missed you too.
So, what are you doing here?
I mean, I thought I'd never see you again.
Wanna get out of here?
I'm grounded.
Bummer.
Is Spider-Man grounded?
I mean, I...
[Rio] Miles?
Your dad's ready to listen now.
That's three months!
[Miles] Wait, hold on.
There's an elite society with all the best Spider-People in it?
-Okay, so there's this lady, Jess Drew. -Uh-huh?
-She rides a motorcycle. -Motorcycle? Oh, my gosh, I'm learning so much from her.
Oh, yeah. I've learned a lot of stuff too.
I've leveled up my whole thing. See?
-[Gwen] Oh, yeah? -Yeah.
-[Gwen] Let's see it, then. -Let's go.
[Gwen] Thread the needle.
Easy.
[Gwen] And Miguel. -The whole thing was his idea. -[Miles] Right.
And who's Miguel?
[Gwen] Oh, he's like a ninja-vampire-Spider-Man but a good guy.
[Miles] A vampire good guy. I'd pay good money to see that.
-So how long ago did they invite you? -Only like a few months ago.
-"Months" is kind of a long time. -[Gwen] Okay, this one counts for two.
Look at you.
Look at me.
[Miles] Keep the change.
-So this club. -Look at that dum-dum.
[Miles] What kind of stuff do you do? [Gwen] Guy in the stripes, ten points.
We're trying to keep the multiverse from collapsing.
[Miles] I thought we did that already.
[Gwen] Like, last week we had this mission to some Shakespeare dimension.
-[Miles] What? -And Hobie and I just, like-- -[Miles] Who's Hobie? -[Gwen] Oh, my gosh, you would love him.
-[Miles] Who's Hobie? -[Gwen] Oh, my gosh, you would love him.
He lets me crash in his dimension sometimes.
[Miles] What does that mean, you stay overnight or...?
[Gwen] Anyway, they're pretty strict about where I go,
or I really would have come to see you sooner.
Right. So, uh-- So why'd you come now?
Don't do that. [yelps]
Hey, Gw-- Uh, Gwen?
Where'd you go?
Where did she go?
-[Gwen] Ah! -Oh, hey. There you are. -What were you doing? -Waiting for you.
-What were you doing? -Waiting for you.
[Miles] No, it's not the Greek burger place.
-This is a cool thinking spot. -[Miles] Right?
Who needs a treadmill when you have the Williamsburgh Bank Building?
-["Another Dimension" playing] -So, uh, you and your dad.
You still haven't talked?
What exactly would we talk about?
"Hey, Dad, how have the last few months been?
You still think I murdered my best friend?"
I don't know.
I mean, my parents-- I mean, maybe if I told them--
Don't.
Trust me on that.
Well...
Maybe some things are supposed to be just for us.
That's a nice way to think about it.
I'm just a really emotionally intelligent guy.
Beyond my years.
It really is always so great to talk to you.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
I mean, how many people can you talk to about this stuff?
You don't even know.
What?
You're the only friend I've ever really made after Peter died.
Other than Hobie, right?
-That's different. -Yeah? How's that?
I don't know.
You and me, it's...
We're the same.
In the important ways, you know?
In every other universe, Gwen Stacy falls for Spider-Man.
And in every other universe,
it doesn't end well.
Well, there's a first time for everything, right?
-Mmm! Oh, wow. Feelings make me hungry. -Oh, yeah,
-Mmm! Oh, wow. Feelings make me hungry. -Oh, yeah, these plátanos are just deep-fried feelings.
She looks old enough to vote.
I bet she doesn't even speak Spanish. Well, qué barbaridad.
[Miles] This keeps you from glitching in other dimensions?
[Gwen] Yeah. Pretty cool.
[Miles] What's it gonna take for Miguel O'Hara to notice Miles Morales?
[chuckles] I'll put in a good word.
I'm just saying, if I had a watch, I could come with you.
-Miles, look-- -I did save the multiverse.
It's a really small, elite strike force.
I can turn invisible. I have, like, electric powers.
-There aren't a lot of slots. -Think about it.
Ah, right.
Look, if it was up to me, you--
I know. I know, I know.
Oh, no. No, no.
-Don't do that. Miles! -All right.
-It's, uh, really delicate. -Geez.
Sorry. I didn't mean to, um, snap.
Okay. All right. I'm sorry.
-Hello! Hi. -[Gwen and Miles yelp]
-Oh, boy. -I'm Miles's mom.
Rio! Hi! I've heard so much about you.
You're using my first name. Okay.
This is nice. We found it in Miles's room, so...
-I guess you must've been there, huh? -And you must be Jeff.
She called me Jeff. That's very sweet. "Jeff."
You must mean Lieutenant Morales.
Soon to be Captain Morales.
Ah! Captain.
Gwanda and I are friends from school.
-Yeah, we were just catching up. -Oh...
Don't take him from me.
Mom.
[laughing] I'm just kidding. He's grounded, so you can't.
-Don't break his heart. -Mom!
-Alpha Squad, Zero Red Spider Alert. -Shoot, I have to go.
-Really? -Yeah, I forgot to get my steps in.
[laughs nervously] Really, really wish I could stay longer.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye.
Yeah, bye.
I can hear you being quiet, Mom.
I hope I didn't ice your game, man.
No one my age says those words in that order, Mom.
It's just hard to see my little man not be my little boy all the time.
Yeah.
Papá, you know you can tell me anything.
Well...
I'm...
I'm sorry I was late.
[in English] Go.
She seems like a nice girl.
-Is this a trick? -It's not a trick.
-Is this a trick? -It's not a trick. Geez.
What are you--?
Let me fix you. Just...
For years I've been taking care of this little boy, right?
Making sure he's loved,
that he feels like he belongs wherever he wants to be.
He wants to go out into the world and do great big things.
And what I worry about most...
is they won't look out for you like us.
They won't root for you like us.
So here's the deal.
Wherever you go from here, you have to promise to take care of that little boy for me.
Make sure he never forgets where he came from.
And he never doubts that he's loved.
And he never lets anyone at those big, fancy places he's gonna be in
tell him that he doesn't belong there.
And when he comes home, and he better come home...
you're gonna be early,
and you're gonna be holding a normal, nice cake.
Yeah, okay.
You gotta promise, Miles.
I promise.
Just...
-don't get lost. -Mm-hm. Okay.
All right.
[in English] Cool.
[in English] Now go. Get out of here.
And when you come back, you're still grounded.
Yeah, I'm smiling like it's a joke, but it's true.
Yeah, I figured.
See you later.
With a cake.
Shoot.
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, the car!
[Gwen] Shoot.
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot.
-Show me what happened. -[LYLA] Replay commencing.
[Spot] Spots. That's the thing. I need more spots!
Ha! Oh, my gosh. It was right under where my nose would've been.
I just need a little bit more dimensional juice or whatever.
-Shoot. -Shoot!
Never came up with a good name. Branding was never my strong suit.
The city power line to my micro collider prototype
could generate a little more concentrated dark energy.
Shoot.
This is what I love about science!
[Gwen] Shoot!
I just need enough to get me somewhere with a full-size collider.
And, Spider-Man, I'll make you pay for everything you took away from me.
All right, this is gonna work.
Or vaporize me and everything in this building,
which would not be good.
-Shoot. -Shoot.
Oh, man.
-Shoot. -Shoot.
[LYLA] Replay complete.
Why, why, why? [groans]
-Gwen, Gwen, Gwen! -Gwen. Hi.
Whatcha doing?
Nothing. Uh, good. All good. Yeah, everything's good. Bye.
Where's the bad guy you were supposed to monitor?
He just stepped out for a moment.
-Dude! -He's just some villain of the week.
-LYLA! -Oh! We don't need--
Tracking...
Hey, look, I got him. Nope, never mind.
Hold on. Slippery guy.
-Did you go see your little friend? -What? No.
-[Jess] Miles? -I mean...
Are you kidding me?
-Only briefly. From afar. -How far?
Like, you know, about this:
-About this far. -That's way too close.
Girl!
Look, I had to know how he was.
-I honestly can't with you. -I know I messed up, okay?
[Jess] He can't be part of this.
[Gwen] I know.
-I'll never see him again. All right? -[Jess] No kidding.
-Hey, guys? He's making his own portals. -What?
He can jump wherever he wants. He could be a total canon killer.
You said he was the villain of the week. Do you know how bad this is for you?
Every dimension he stops at has an Alchemax.
-What's he up to, Gwen? -I don't know.
[Miles] He's making himself more powerful so he can beat me.
Amazing. My star pupil, everyone.
I'll get him, okay? I can get backup.
If Miguel finds out I let you come--
Don't tell Miguel. He'll kick me out and--
What if he sends me home?
I got him. Earth-50101.
What do you wanna do?
You never made a mistake?
Never got too close to someone?
I did.
But I got over it.
Alert the local Spider. Tell him Gwen will meet him there.
Alert the local Spider. Tell him Gwen will meet him there. [LYLA] I'm on it.
-Thank you. I won't let you down again. -Okay. You're welcome. Shut up.
You got an hour to fix this.
Or I can't help you.
Goodbye, Miles.
-[cheering and chattering] -Sorry. Congratulations!
[Spot] See that? This is incredible. -Like a new person. -[Gwen] Where'd you go?
[Spot] In the mirror, I wouldn't recognize myself.
-[Gwen] Stay still. -I'd envy that person I was looking at.
-[Gwen] I have eyes on the anomaly. -[Jess] Get hands on him.
Stop hovering. You're hovering.
Hello, pardon me, locals.
Wow, four on there. That's very dangerous.
That looks good.
-Which way to Alchemax? Oh! [coughs] -[screaming]
It's a place with a big collider--
-Hey, cow guy! "Moo-ve" over! -[Spot] That's the best you could do?
-[Miles] Gwen! I'm here to help! -Miles, are you--?
[Spot] Whoopsie-daisy. You weren't expecting that, were you?
-[Miles] Oh, no! -[Spot] Neither was I. I'm in the zone!
-[Miles] I got you! -Did you follow me?
No, I just saw where you went and went there without you knowing.
-You're not supposed to be here! -What are you talking about? I'm helping--
No! No, no, no!
I shouldn't have ever come to see you.
Dang.
[Pav] Hey, who's the new guy?
Hey, Pav. He's Miles and he wasn't invited.
[Pav] Oh! You weren't invited and you came anyway?
-Right? -New guy must be in love with you.
-[Gwen] Okay, whoa. -[Miles] No.
-I'm not. -I'm good at reading people.
-[Gwen] He's not. -[Miles] Who are you?
-[Pav] Glad you asked, new guy. -I'm not a new guy.
My name is Pavitr Prabhakar, and for the past six months--
Six? And even he got a watch?
-Yeah, uh... -Being Spider-Man is so easy.
I wake up, skip the workout,
because I'm naturally buff and I don't wanna get too big.
because I'm naturally buff and I don't wanna get too big. Do almost nothing with my amazing hair.
You don't use any product at all?
Just coconut oil, prayer, some genetics.
Then I swing by school. Don't really have to try, but I do anyway.
Fight a few bad guys, feed a few street dogs,
quick break for a cup of chai with my Maya Auntie--
-I love chai tea. -What did you just say?
"Chai tea"? "Chai" means "tea," bro. You're saying "tea" tea.
"Chai" means "tea," bro. You're saying "tea" tea.
Would I ask you for a "coffee" coffee with "cream" cream?
I'm so sorry.
[Pav] Then I hang out with my girlfriend, Gayatri.
She's an extremely classy teenager.
Hey, girl. Tonight, I was thinking--
Hello, Police Inspector Singh. This is your daughter. I do not know her.
To top it off, I live in the best possible Spider-Man city, Mumbattan.
Quick tour. This is where the traffic is, this is where the traffic is.
Quick tour. This is where the traffic is, this is where the traffic is. Traffic here too. This is where the British stole all of our stuff. Whoa!
Traffic here too. This is where the British stole all of our stuff. Whoa!
-[Spot] Hello, Spider-Man. -[Gwen] Hi.
-[Pav] Hey. -[Spot] Not you.
-[Pav] Hey. -[Spot] Not you. [Gwen] You talking to him or me?
-[Miles] Think he means me. -[Spot] Yeah. Him.
[Miles] I got this, guys.
-Huh? -Wow. How are you?
-[dramatic music playing] -Can you tell I leveled up my game?
I'm on a journey of self-improvement.
[Pav] And you came to India.
That's a Western culture cliché. Don't Eat, Pray, Love me, bro.
I did not mean it like that.
Let me guess, you're gonna ask me about saffron and cardamom
and naan bread, which is the same as saying "bread" bread,
which is the same as saying "chai tea."
-[Spot] Oh, I love chai tea. -[Pav] No!
[Miles] Come on, man! I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot.
[Miles] Come on, man! I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot. Let's just talk about this.
Fine. You made me feel empty, like I had a hole inside of me.
[Spot] We all have holes.
But now I found out what to fill that hole up with.
More holes!
[Miles] That doesn't make any sense!
[Spot] It will.
I'm okay. I'm good.
-Don't worry. -[Gwen] We won't.
This romantic tension is so palpable.
If Spot gets more holes...
-[Pav] Will they, won't they? -...he'll be unstoppable!
-We can't let him get to-- -[Gwen] Alchemax?
[Pav] See? How can you guys even concentrate?
Hey, does he know about Hobie?
-What should I know about Hobie? -Oh, looks like he did not know.
Boop.
Go away. Go away. See you later. Thanks for coming.
[Pav] Would you please deactivate this strong barrier?
[man] It can't be turned off until the collider sequence is complete.
[man] It can't be turned off until the collider sequence is complete. The collider sequence? Oh, man.
The collider sequence? Oh, man.
-[Gwen] You need to stop! -[Miles] You don't know what you're doing!
-[Gwen] You need to stop! -[Miles] You don't know what you're doing! [Spot] I'm about to be so much more than a villain of the week.
I'm sorry I called you that, okay? You're a great villain.
[Spot] Oh, not yet, I'm not. -[automated voice] Initializing collider. -No!
-[automated voice] Initializing collider. -No!
-[beeping] -[whirring]
How's it going now?
Great. Anyone got any ideas?
[Pav] Oh, I have so many, but none for this.
Stand back. I've been working on something new.
-[Pav] How long does this usually take? -[Miles] Just give me a second.
Do you want us to do something, or do we just stand here?
Are you charging it, or--?
No. I'm absorbing it so I can shoot it back.
-[Gwen] Looks like charging. -[Pav] Does this have a name?
[Miles] Hold your questions until I'm done breaking this!
Just let me do this!
[Hobie] Oi, oi!
-Hobie! -[Pav] Hobie, my guy!
-[Miles] Hobie? -[Spot] Look, another one.
-[Miles] Hobie? -[Spot] Look, another one. I love how many different variations of you guys there are.
-Man-like, Pav! Big stepper! Yeah, mate! -What's this dude saying?
[Pav] It's English for "We get along great, and we're close friends."
Is this the younger from 1610?
Do you understand this guy?
[Pav] Hobie, thanks for breaking the shield!
[Miles] I loosened it.
Bit of advice. Use the palm, not just your fingers.
What's up with your suit? Is he bleeding from his armpits?
-[Gwen] Miles, Hobie. Hobie, Miles. -Hi. I've never heard of you
-[Gwen] Miles, Hobie. Hobie, Miles. -Hi. I've never heard of you because Gwen barely ever mentions you.
A'ight, my name's Hobie, Hobie Brown. I was bitten by a--
Wouldn't you like to know? You know what I mean?
For the last three years, I've been the one and only-- Wait, wait, wait.
Think I'm gonna show you my secret identity? Come out of it.
That is, when I'm not playing shows, antagonizing fascists,
staging unpermitted political actions slash performance-art pieces,
or having a laugh at the pub with the mandem.
I'm not a role model. I was briefly a runway model.
I hate the a.m. I hate the PM. I hate labels.
I'm not a hero because calling yourself a hero
makes you a self-mythologizing, narcissistic autocrat.
Come on! I thought you hated labels.
[Hobie] Gwendy, you left your jumper around my place.
-What's a jumper? -[Pav] It's a sweater.
-How many sweaters do you have? -That's not mine, I'm sure.
-[Hobie] And your toothbrush. -[Miles] Wait, what?
-[Pav yells] -[Hobie] Are those my Chucks?
-[Spot] You make a heck of a team. -[Hobie] I don't believe in teams.
-[Spot] You make a heck of a team. -[Hobie] I don't believe in teams. -[Miles] Aren't you in a band? -I don't believe in consistency.
-[Miles] Aren't you in a band? -I don't believe in consistency.
This guy's killing me.
This is gonna be good for us, Spider-Man.
You and me, we're finally gonna live up to our potential.
You'll finally have a villain worth fighting.
And I won't be just a joke to you!
[Miles] You're not a joke!
-Right, gang? -[Gwen] Absolutely.
-[Pav] Completely unamusing! -[Hobie] I don't believe in comedy!
Just kidding!
[Miles] See? No one here thinks you're a joke!
-[Spot] They won't after this. -[Miles] No!
Wow. That was another easy adventure for Spider-Man. -[Gwen] No, no, no! -[Miles] No, no, no!
I'm coming!
[Miles] What was that?
[Spot] Our future.
I'm gonna take everything from you, like you took everything from me.
What?
[Spot] See you back home, Spider-Man.
Miles. Miles!
You okay? We gotta go.
[Hobie] Oi, oi, liven up, mate. No time to get dizzy.
[Pav] Everyone, chalo, chalo!
We'll clear the path. You slow down that building.
[Hobie] I'll do it. But not because you told me to.
[man] Everybody, run!
Watch out!
Gayatri!
Gayatri! No!
[LYLA] Gwen, heads up.
Markers are predicting an incoming canon event.
So tread carefully.
I'm on it.
Somebody, help!
-Hurry, everyone! This way, quickly! -[girl] Help!
Inspector Singh!
I can do both!
-[Miles] I got him, I got him! -[Gwen] Miles!
Don't worry. Thread the needle, ring the bell, right?
-It's too dangerous. -I'll be okay, I promise.
Miles!
[Gwen] Miles!
No! No.
You're all right.
I promised.
[Pav] Are you okay? I was so worried.
I mean, you seem like a nice young woman that I do not know.
Gayatri!
Not bad, right?
Right.
[in English] I've never seen him so emotional.
[in English] Excellent job.
Man-like, Miles! My guy!
[Pav] Easy.
So, what do you think?
What I always think.
You're amazing.
We make a good team. Yeah?
Yeah.
[Pav] Guys, what's that?
[Hobie] It's a metaphor for capitalism.
[Gwen] It's a lot worse than that.
Okay, guys, secure the area, clear all civilians, and let's contain this quantum hole.
Hey, I'm Miles. We met before, when I was invisible.
Hey, I'm Miles. We met before, when I was invisible. I know who you are.
Is everything going to be okay?
Okay, let me explain.
Miguel wants you back at HQ.
-Miles was just about to head out. -All of you.
-I don't follow orders, neither does he. -I'm invited to HQ? Whoo!
How are you even cooler under your mask?
I was this cool the whole time.
Hey, over here.
Yo, this place is wild.
-[Jess] Any sign of Spot? -[Malala] Let me ask.
-[Jess] Any sign of Spot? -[Malala] Let me ask. Anybody spot Spot?
-Oh, so funny. Anybody else got jokes? -Now that you mention it.
-Oh, so funny. Anybody else got jokes? -Now that you mention it. [Gwen] Well, you know what they say, we need to run a spot check.
-[Spider-Beings chattering] -[Miles] This is unbelievable.
-This is the lobby. -Oh.
Welcome to Spider-Society.
It's a bit much, innit?
[Miles] What happened to that small, elite strike team?
A lot of these are part-time.
Gwendy, how much have you told him, hm? About his place in all this?
A little.
-Maybe not enough. -Here.
My own watch!
It's a day pass. This just keeps you from...
...doing that.
-[Peter] Hey, Gwen. -Hey, Peter.
Hey, I'm Miles.
-[Peters] Hey, Gwen. -Hey, Peters.
I'm a new recruit.
Peter, take a team to the transport deck to help deal with this Spot mess.
Peter, take a team to the transport deck to help deal with this Spot mess. -[honks horn] -I wouldn't call it a mess.
-[honks horn] -I wouldn't call it a mess. -More like a success in progress. -Ben, I need--
-More like a success in progress. -Ben, I need--
Sorry, I can't talk right now. I'm thinking about my past.
Actually, we need you here for some reason.
[yells] That was a particularly harrowing memory.
-Is he okay? -[neighs]
-Ah! -Howdy. Name's Web-Slinger.
-Why does the horse need a mask? -[Web-Slinger] To conceal her face.
Giddy up!
-[yelling] -[Miles] Who is in these laser cages?
Anomalies. Folks who wound up in the wrong dimension.
[Jess] We kick their butts and send them home.
They're not very interesting.
-We got a bunch of Doc Ocks. -That's interesting.
A Moosterio. Ms. Sterio.
A Moosterio. Ms. Sterio. -Video game guy. -[Miles] I love video games!
-Another video game guy. -Are you talking to me?
Typeface.
-Go to Helvetica, Spider-Man! -Bold.
An interesting Kraven, a boring Rhino.
A Prowler.
-Prowler? -[Gwen] Not your Prowler.
Hey.
Hey.
-It's rude to stare. -Caught that one myself.
-I slipped. -You? I did all the work.
How many missions have you been on together?
-Not that many. -Couple dozen.
That's cool. Sorry.
-I'm Spider-Man. -Oh, no way! All of us are.
-Can we just keep moving? -Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you?
I'm an avatar.
My body is back in my parents' dimension, chilling in a gaming chair and eating Fritos.
chilling in a gaming chair and eating Fritos. [woman] Right, because you don't listen.
Here is better.
I hear that.
What does that do?
Apart from having a great name?
-The Go Home Machine. -What'd I say, eh?
I voted against it.
[Margo] It detects whatever dimension your DNA is from
and sends you there.
It's super humane and not creepy.
[Margo] See you, dawg. Don't come back.
We should go. We don't wanna keep the boss waiting.
-See you around? -Let's go!
-Good luck out there, man. -Okay, bye!
[LYLA] Miguel sounds hangry.
[Jess] He likes those empanadas from the cafeteria.
Don't ask me why.
My name is Miguel O'Hara.
I'm this dimension's one and only Spider-Man.
At least, I was.
But I'm not like the others.
I don't always like what I have to do.
But I know I have to be the one to do it.
I've given up too much to stop now.
Whoa, yo.
Bet this doesn't even do anything.
[Miles] Maybe it did before you ripped it out of a wall.
It's propaganda, bruv. To distract you from the truth.
[sighs] And what's that?
I ain't got a Scooby Doo. That's what they want.
-Why you wanna be part of this lot? -[Miles] To get a watch.
-Make your own watch. -Pssh.
Bet you got a nice setup, eh? Nice parents.
They're fine. I mean, we got in a fight, but...
They just want what's best for me, so...
-That's a bloody shame. -Why?
'Cause you're not ready for everybody else.
-[girl] We did it this time! -[man] Okay, okay, mija.
Good job.
[Hobie] Listen to me, bruv. Whole point of being Spider-Man is your independence.
Being your own boss. You don't need all this.
-Then why are you here? -Looking out for my drummer, is all.
I want to be in a band. I--
I wanna see my friends, and I need a watch to do that.
Guys, come on.
All right. Squashed.
Don't enlist till you know what war you're fighting.
[whispers] Yeah, I know it's slow.
But it's his thing.
[in normal voice] Miguel O'Hara, meet Miles Morales. Hey! [speaks in Spanish]
[in English] I speak Spanish.
-[in English] I'm excited to get going. -[in English] Oh. Great.
-I have new ideas on how to catch Spot. -Oh. Wow. Uh-huh.
[Miles] He just wants to be taken seriously, like we all do. Whoa!
He's worried about Spot. I'll worry about Spot!
-What did I do? -Miguel! It's not his fault.
-Fault? Hold up. -You blew another hole in the multiverse!
-He doesn't know any better. -I do know what-- Not know what?
But you did, Gwen.
And you-- I'm just gonna try to ignore you.
-I just can't. I can't even. -I ain't even here.
Or here.
-What's happening? -[Peter] Hey, Miguel!
-What's happening? -[Peter] Hey, Miguel! Come on, go easy on the kid.
-He had a terrible teacher. -[uplifting music playing]
He had no chance.
-Peter! -Oh, boy.
Humbling-Reality Spider-Man has arrived.
-Miles! -Dude!
Don't be afraid of my friend Miguel. He just looks scary. He's got no bite.
-[groans] Peter. -You're growing up on me. You look great.
-You look solid, you know. You look good. -Define "solid."
What happened? You bleeding from the armpits?
-Peter, you-- -Don't worry, we'll get you a new suit.
Peter, you gotta tell them--
-Wait. What is that? -[Peter] Mayday!
-You have a baby! -I have a baby.
This is crazy.
Don't forget to keep your little day pass on, honey.
Oh, you have one too. I didn't know they made those for adults.
-Give me a second. Mayday! -The kid's an anarchist.
I'm coming up to get you. Here I come. Don't move.
I got you. I knew I was gonna regret making her that web shooter.
I shouldn't have done it. That's an actual mistake.
-You wanna see pictures? -She's right there.
-Look at this pic! -Oh, you've got them.
-She's incredible. -Yup.
This is her funny face. That's her mad face.
This one is the studious one.
Watch out, the next one you're gonna crack up.
Miguel's gonna die. Miguel, look at this one.
I'm trying to hold a serious adult conversation.
You're the only Spider-Man who isn't funny. -We're supposed to be funny. -The fate of the multiverse--
-We're supposed to be funny. -The fate of the multiverse--
You always lose me with that.
You say, "The fate of the multiverse," and my brain dies.
Do you guys smell that? Mayday took a crap.
-Yup. She's a Parker. -[Miguel] Miles. That happens when a Parker eats an avocado.
-You disrupted a canon event. -Canon event?
-You disrupted a canon event. -Canon event? The kid wasn't thinking. That's not how he works.
The kid wasn't thinking. That's not how he works.
That's insulting.
Taking a crap on the establishment. I salute you.
Wait, what are you upset about? I saved those people.
And that's the problem.
-LYLA, do the thing. -Huh? What thing?
What do you mean, "What thing?" The information-explainy thing.
Okay.
What's this?
This is everything.
Can you be more specific?
Can you not talk for a second?
[Miles] Yeah, yeah, I-- [Miguel] And this here?
This is all of us.
All of our lives woven together
in a beautiful web of life and destiny.
The Spider-Verse.
Spider-Verse.
That's stupid.
It's called the Arachnohumanoid Polymultiverse.
Which sounds stupid too, I guess.
And these nodes where the lines converge?
[Miguel] They are the canon.
Chapters that are a part of every Spider's story every time.
Some good.
Some bad.
Some very bad.
Just keep going.
Uncle Aaron.
This one, Event ASM-90.
A police captain close to Spider-Man dies,
saving a kid from falling rubble during a battle with an archnemesis.
Captain Stacy.
I'm so sorry.
No.
That happened to you?
And me.
Ey. What of it?
[Miguel] That's how the story is supposed to go.
Canon events are the connections that bind our lives together.
But those connections can be broken.
That's why anomalies are so dangerous.
Inspector Singh's death was a canon event.
You weren't supposed to be there. And you weren't supposed to save him.
-That's why Gwen tried to stop you. -[Gwen] Miles!
I thought you were trying to save me.
I was. I...
I was doing both.
And now, Miles, because you changed the story,
Pavitr's dimension is unraveling.
If we're lucky, we can stop it.
We haven't always been lucky.
That wasn't me. That was the Spot.
It's what happens when you break the canon.
[Miles] How do you know?
Because I broke it once myself.
I found a world where I had a family. Where I was happy.
At least, a version of me was.
And that version of myself was killed.
So I replaced him.
I thought it was harmless.
But I was wrong.
Daddy? Dad.
Daddy, no!
[Miguel] Isn't that right, Peter?
Yeah.
You break enough canon, save enough captains...
and we could lose everything.
My dad is about to be captain.
No.
[Spot] I'm gonna take everything from you...
-like you took everything from me. -[Jeff] I'm coming!
Spot does it.
He kills him.
When does it happen?
-When does it happen? -In two days.
When he's sworn in.
That's what the model says.
[Miguel] I'm sorry, Miles.
Send me home.
I can't do that. Not now.
What am I supposed to do? Just let him die?
What about your dad?
He's a captain, right?
Yeah.
[Miles] And that's it?
You aren't gonna do anything about it?
Okay, what about Uncle Ben?
That have been okay if you knew and you just let it play out?
If not for Uncle Ben,
most of us wouldn't be here, Miles.
And all the good we did, it...
It wouldn't have been done.
So we're just supposed to let people die
because some algorithm says that that's supposed to happen?
You realize how messed up that sounds, right?
You have a choice between saving one person
and saving an entire world. Every world.
I can do both. Spider-Man always--
Not always.
Miles, we all want to live the life we wish we had.
Believe me, I have tried.
And the harder I tried, the more damage I did.
You can't have it all, kid.
Being Spider-Man is a sacrifice.
That's the job.
That's what you signed up for.
[Peni] Miles.
[Miles] Peni?
What is this?
Is this is an intervention or something?
We know it's hard.
But it's the truth, Miles.
Is that why you're here? To let me down easy?
It worked last time, why not run it back, huh?
-Hey, hold on. Hold on. -You were right, Gwen.
-You should've never come to see me. -Kid, look at--
-You should've never come to see me. -Kid, look at-- Stop calling me that.
-There we go. -Hobie, not helping.
-Good. -Miles, please understand.
-Good. -Miles, please understand. You can't ask me not to save my father.
I'm not asking.
Just give him a second, please. -This is a great look. -Don't! Stop it!
-This is a great look. -Don't! Stop it!
If we let him leave, he'll only do more damage. We both know that.
Little man. Peter Pan. Palms.
Little man. Peter Pan. Palms. [Miguel] Just need to hold you a few days. Sorry it had to end like this, kid.
[Miguel] Just need to hold you a few days. Sorry it had to end like this, kid.
I said not to call me that!
-[dramatic music playing] -Miles!
All right.
I'm sorry for doing this. This is bad parenting.
Just for the record, I quit.
[Miguel over PA] All stations, drop what you're doing and stop Spider-Man.
-You? -You? -Me? -Me?
[in English] Miles! Miles Morales! He's entering Sector 4!
-Is that him? -Do I, uh, have web on my face?
-Is that him? -Do I, uh, have web on my face? What's the deal?
[Miguel] Miles! He's right there. He's right in-- -Turn around! -I don't see anything, boss.
-Turn around! -I don't see anything, boss.
Can this day get any damn weirder?
Wow! I guess it can.
-Whoa! -Sorry!
And then I looked at my uncle, and...
Uh, let me guess. He died?
On the count of three, draw.
One-- You didn't wait for three!
Hey, Miguel!
Can you take a photo of this? It's her first chase.
-[Spider-Being yelling] -[prisoners booing]
Boo.
-[female Spider] Miles? -[Miles] Hi.
-I'm a huge fan of your work. -Thanks.
Do you think Spider-People too often use comedy as a crutch? -Uh... -Get it? "Crutch"?
-Uh... -Get it? "Crutch"?
-I can do anything he can. -[dramatic sting plays]
Oh, dang, I pulled something.
-[Dr. Octopus] Hello, Peter. -[Miles yells]
There's nowhere to run.
My bad, everybody. There was somewhere to run.
-[Miguel] Stop running! -Then stop chasing me!
-[Miguel] Stop running! -Then stop chasing me! [Miguel] You're so frustrating.
I know he's your friend, but it's the only way.
-But my gut says-- -Then use your head.
[Ben Reilly] I've got you trapped in my well-defined musculature.
So don't even-- [yells]
Miles.
-No, no. Let me go. -It is crazy to run.
Running is the least crazy thing going on.
-Look, I feel bad. -Good!
But this is just how stuff works. You're not gonna win here.
Just wait, don't move. Stop moving so fast.
No!
-Do you wanna hold my baby? -What?
Would you just give the baby one squeeze and then we'll talk?
I think it's gonna change our vibe. It's very rejuvenating. I'm plenty juvenated.
I'm plenty juvenated.
You'll get more so when you go chest-to-chest with this magical child.
You don't get to have a heartfelt conversation with me.
Just hold the baby, we'll see what happens!
You're the reason I had her, okay?
I thought that if I did a decent job raising her,
then there was a chance she was gonna turn out like you.
And that got me excited because you are a wonderful person.
-And I like being around you. -[poignant, pensive music playing]
Then why didn't you come see me?
Bec--
I couldn't.
I wanted to be with you guys so badly.
But this thing isn't what I thought it was.
Look, bad things are gonna happen.
It makes us who we are.
But good things happen too, you know?
Like you happened.
And she happened.
Hey, I don't...
And you are so bad at holding a baby.
-[LYLA] We got your location, Peter. -Wait, wait. No, no!
You do not have my location. Over.
Send everyone.
No, no, no, Miles, I didn't know. I promise you.
Please, man, let's talk about this.
We did.
Good talk.
[Spider-Man] Get him!
[Gwen] Miles!
-Where does he think he's going? -[Peter] Don't think he planned this out.
If I hadn't said it before, by the way,
you're a terrible mentor.
He did just beat you, so I'm not a terrible mentor.
[Miguel] You're both equally terrible. Does that settle it?
Stop pretending you know where you're going!
[Miles] Oh, I have a plan. I just haven't told you yet.
-[LYLA] Departing for the moon. -That's not good.
What are those, claws?
Dude, are you sure you're even Spider-Man?
[Miguel] Are you?
Who do you think you are? Really?
My name is Miles Morales.
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.
And I'm pretty sure you know the rest, jerk!
Hey. What's up, man?
[Miguel] You don't get it. You're an anomaly.
Not if you let me go home.
[Miles] Snitch!
[Miguel] Everywhere you go, you're an anomaly.
You're the original anomaly.
Miguel!
[Miguel] The spider that gave you your powers wasn't from your dimension.
It was never supposed to bite you.
Miguel, don't!
[Miguel] There's a world out there with no Spider-Man to protect them
-because it bit you instead. -No.
[Miguel] You're not supposed to be Spider-Man.
No! You're lying. I'm Spider-Man!
[Miguel] You're a mistake!
If you hadn't been bit, your Peter Parker would have lived.
Instead, he died saving you.
He would've stopped the collider before it ever went off.
Spot wouldn't exist.
-And none of this would've happened. -Peter. [groans]
And all this time, I have been the only one holding it all together.
-[Peter] Miguel, go easy on him! -You don't belong here.
You never did.
Let me go. -Miguel, that's enough. -This isn't what we talked about.
-Miguel, that's enough. -This isn't what we talked about.
You talked about this?
You knew?
You all knew?
I didn't know...
how to tell you.
That's why you never came to see me.
-Miles, it's for your own good. -Who decides that?
I'm not a kid, Gwen.
That's exactly what you are.
You're just a kid who has no idea what he's doing!
Yeah, well, I did lure hundreds of Spider-People away from your little clubhouse.
What?
I guess he did plan this out.
And I'm about to do this.
Everyone keeps telling me how my story is supposed to go.
Nah.
I'm gonna do my own thing.
Goodbye, Gwen.
Miles!
I taught him how to do that, so I gotta be a pretty good mentor to pull that off.
so I gotta be a pretty good mentor to pull that off.
Nope. No. Uh-uh.
That's kind of cute. Oh, no. Mm-mm.
Been there. Done that.
[automated voice] Initializing Go Home Machine.
Dimensional signature identified.
Come on.
No. No.
-Oh, no. -No.
What's happening?
The machine activated on its own.
-How is that possible? -It isn't.
It's not possible for the accelerator protocol to engage without entering a sequence key.
-Okay. Which...? -Which it's doing right now.
-How about this? -No.
-How about now? -You're getting in the way.
Stop him! Now!
What does it look like I'm trying to do?
Do something.
Now!
[Peter] Miguel.
[Gwen] Miguel, stop!
No!
Okay. Enough. It's not the console's fault.
[Miguel] All he had to do was listen!
-Why didn't he listen? -Maybe you weren't hard enough.
-Why didn't he listen? -Maybe you weren't hard enough. -Gwen, don't do it. -[Miguel] You let him go.
-Gwen, don't do it. -[Miguel] You let him go.
-Me? -You didn't catch him, Gwen.
-Okay, let's all just take a breath. -Peter, you wanna back me up?
Well, okay, Miguel, as a father of a daughter and the son of a mother--
-Yeah, actually, stop talking. -Okay, duly noted.
Let me just talk to him.
We tried that.
-He's my friend. -Yeah. And that's the problem.
Do you know for certain what happens if he breaks the canon?
Do you wanna find out? I told you she was a liability.
You're wrong.
Jess, tell him he's wrong.
He's not.
Are you serious right now?
I told you. You let him get away, I can't help you.
I'm not coming.
You're right.
What...?
What the hell?
Go home, Gwen.
We are supposed to be the good guys.
We are.
We are.
Jess, Ben. Come with me.
Hell, yeah.
[Miguel] And somebody catch Spot.
Yeah. Sorry. I gotta get her down for her nap.
Not you. I've had the right amount of you.
Hey, hon.
How was work?
[Peter] I don't know.
Peter? Did you bring our baby to another fight?
Did I bring our ba--? No. No, no.
'Cause you asked me not to. So I didn't. I wouldn't.
Access denied. Access denied.
You think I'll be any good at this?
You're asking that now?
There's no playbook for raising someone like her...
or being someone like you.
You just gotta make the right adjustments at halftime.
-That's a sports metaphor, by the way. -I understand.
Sorry. You were just such a nerd in high school. I figured--
But I have watched sports.
-Okay, champ. -Unbelievable.
Wanna go easy on the penguin?
Would you just...?
You gonna even look at me?
What? What is that?
[Gwen] I'm looking at you. Like you asked.
You look skinny.
Where have you been? Just been, uh, out murdering all my friends.
Just been, uh, out murdering all my friends.
Oh, that's funny, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay.
-[Gwen] Where are you going? -I don't know.
You're a good cop, Dad.
You put on that badge because you know if you don't,
someone who shouldn't will.
But you have to understand,
this mask is my badge.
And I'm trying to be good too.
I was trying so hard
to wear this thing the way you would want...
and I didn't.
I didn't.
I can do all these things, but I can't help the people I love the most.
And they can only know half of who I am.
So I'm completely on my own.
And now I don't even know what the right thing is anymore.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do. But I know...
I can't lose one more friend.
Gwen, I always taught you to do it by the book.
And how did that work out?
-I took an oath. -Then arrest me, Dad.
-Get it over with. -I... I can't.
Why not?
Because I quit.
When?
About halfway through your big speech.
You're...
Wait a minute, you're not gonna be captain?
That means...
My job, being captain,
this whole thing doesn't matter anymore.
You're the best thing I've ever done.
-It was a good speech, huh? -No wonder you got an A in English.
B. I got a B-plus.
Missed a few classes.
I don't know what it is you gotta do...
but I think that this thing is supposed to help.
The guy who left it was a real piece of work.
I'll be right back.
Promise.
Parenting stuff is...
a big-ass mystery.
[Miguel] You're a mistake!
If you hadn't been bit, your Peter Parker would have lived.
And none of this would've happened.
[Spider-Ham] Miles, the hardest thing about this job is you can't always save everybody.
[Spot] I'll make you pay for everything you took away from me.
[Miguel] You have a choice between saving one person
and saving an entire world.
[Miles] I can do both. Spider-Man always--
[Peter] Not always.
[Rio] Whatever you're gonna do out there, don't get lost.
-[Peter] Bad things are gonna happen. -[Gwen] I didn't know how to tell you.
[Miguel] You were never supposed to be Spider-Man.
[Aaron] Keep going.
Did you check your locations?
-Yes, Dad. -No sign of him.
LYLA, would you send everyone out? Anywhere. Anywhere he might be.
Congrats, captain.
"Captain"? You can't call me that until I'm sworn in.
We're all proud of you. See you, jefe.
[Ben Reilly] Perfect pose.
Possible disturbance in the alley. Better go check it out.
Now I'm here in the alley. There's something unusual happening.
Looking at the walls. Those are normal.
But there's something in front of me. [yells]
I made it.
I'm home. -[music fades] -[laughs]
-[Rio] Miles? -[gasps]
Is now a bad time?
-Am I too late? -What'd you do to your hair?
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay.
I'm okay.
You were right. You were right about everything.
Of course I'm right. I'm always right.
-What am I right about? -I saw all these amazing places
and met all these amazing people, but... -[speaks in Spanish] -[sighs]
But they didn't want me.
I kept thinking about what you said.
And I let them have it, Mom.
I beat them all.
I know how strong I am now.
I'm strong because of you.
And Dad.
And us.
Mom.
There's something coming for us.
Something... Something terrible.
[in English] Miles, you're talking crazy. What's going on?
His name is Spot. He's my nemesis.
And I'm gonna stop him.
I know you know I've been lying to you.
It's because I thought if you knew...
you wouldn't love me the same.
And then I went out there and...
And now...
I'm not afraid of anything.
What do you wanna tell me?
Promise nothing's gonna change.
-Papá, I will always love you. -You gotta promise.
Always. I don't care what you say.
Mom.
I'm...
I'm Spider-Man.
Who's Spider-Man?
The superhero? He got bit by a spider?
Gave him spider powers?
He's me?
Is this where you dress up like your favorite character for...?
What's it called? Comics-Con?
I don't know what that is.
You really had me going there. Spider-Man. [speaks in Spanish]
Why don't you have eight arms? -Um... -Do you push silk out of your culito?
-I had a nightmare about that, but no. -Are you sure you woke up?
Mom, stop playing around. This is serious.
Dad worked with Spider-Man.
He didn't realize Spider-Man was me at the time, but...
-I wish Dad was here to explain. -Miles, please.
I got you to take care of, I got me to take care of, so help me out.
Mom, hold on, hold on. I need to talk--
Oh, no.
[Gwen] He's in the wrong universe.
[Miguel] The spider that gave you your powers wasn't from your dimension.
[automated voice] Dimensional signature identified.
[Miles] That machine...
didn't send me home.
Uncle Aaron?
Hey.
You okay?
I missed you so much.
[chuckles] Okay. All right, then.
-Whoa, you took your braids out? -Uh...
-On purpose? -Yeah.
Yeah, I'm still getting used to it?
They gave me more hours at the hospital, so next month I swear I'll pay you back.
Stop. Come on. We family.
Thanks.
-[Rio] Hey, honey, how you doing? -Hey. How'd it go with Miles?
-You know how you grounded him? -Mm-hm.
-I ungrounded him. -You what?
A little. I mean, how much trouble could he get into, right?
-[Jeff] A lot of trouble! -[Rio] I don't wanna think about it.
[Rio] Oh, Miles, I have to work an overnight tonight.
-Here's the grocery list. -I'll make sure he gets these done.
All right, we gotta roll.
Security switches out at 6. That's the window, right?
Right. Yeah.
I'm following you in what you are saying.
You all right?
I have a cold.
Come on, man.
Hey, you sure you got the plan?
Yeah, but maybe we should go over it one more time,
just to make sure there's no...
problems.
There's no Spider-Man here.
[Jeff] I'm sorry, baby, but you did unilaterally unground him.
[Rio] Jeff...
[Jeff] I just worry about him getting mixed up with the wrong people, okay?
This is probably that girl.
What is he even thinking, being with her?
I have some ideas.
-Baby, you're really not helping. -You saw the way he lit up around her.
I just hope she doesn't get him hurt.
[Jeff] I mean, am I responsible for this? -No, no. -Maybe it's all my fault.
-No, no. -Maybe it's all my fault.
Come on, papá, you're a great dad. This is hard.
This is hard.
It's like we got a whole new kid who just wants to grow up so fast.
And maybe we gotta grow up too.
A little bit.
Maybe we just gotta let him spread his wings, man.
"Man"?
[Gwen] It's not your fault.
It's mine.
Oh, come on. What the heck are you doing here?
Oh, uh, his window was open so I came in.
Because that's normal to do.
I wanna talk to your parents.
Right. My, uh, dad's kind of hard to get on the horn.
Oh, really? What does he do? Deal drugs?
He's a cop.
Statement withdrawn.
I'm gonna call the station.
I don't think he's there. Or anywhere around here.
-That's his jacket, emo. Where's Miles? -I don't know.
You don't know? What do you mean, you don't know?
Yeah, um, I'll leave.
Where do you think you're going, young lady?
[Gwen] I'm going to find him.
I don't know where, exactly.
But I know where to start.
One thing I learned from Miles:
It's all possible.
He loves you more than you could ever imagine.
I've seen it.
If you do find him...
tell him five months.
And tell him we love him.
You got it.
Uncle Aaron? [grunting]
Wait, wait.
Listen to me. Okay, look.
You don't understand. I'm not from here.
Listen, okay? This machine sent me here by mistake.
Wait, wait, wait. Please. Please.
Uncle Aaron, wait, wait, wait. Uncle Aaron!
Please. Uncle Aaron?
Just hear me out.
I was bit by a spider that gave me powers.
It wasn't supposed to bite me. It was supposed to bite someone else.
Someone from here.
I don't belong here. I need to go home.
Okay?
I have an Uncle Aaron too. I had one.
-He was a bad guy called the Prowler. -[device powers up]
He looked out for me.
He did a lot of bad things, but...
I knew he wanted to be good.
He just didn't know he had a choice, but you do.
You can be a good guy.
[Aaron] "A good guy"?
Please. Trust me. I know you don't wanna be the Prowler.
I'm not.
[Jonah on TV] Mayor Manfredi has extended New York's mandatory curfew
as the so-called Sinister Six cartels battle for control on the streets.
Is nobody gonna try and stop them?
Your dad is still alive?
What?
Your father.
You said he's still alive.
Yeah.
Who are you?
I'm Miles Morales.
But you...
You can call me the Prowler.
If I don't get home...
our dad is gonna die.
Your dad.
Please.
You have to let me go.
Why would I do that?
Don't tell Mom.
[Gwen] I never found the right band to join.
So I started my own.
Congratulations. It's a boy.
Thank you for the good news.
If you are looking for a reward, then you may head to the special ward.
Maybe a prince is being born there.
Go.
Sister, clean the baby and keep him in the crib next to his mom.
I will inform Mr. Jindal and his family.
I can't understand a word, Pandit Ji.
Is it a good or a bad sign to be born during a deluge?
-Sir. -Okay.
-So-- -Sir, I need to make an urgent call.
Can't you see I am on a call?
Sir, it's an emergency. Please!
What happened?
A baby was born in the special ward some time ago.
The boy was stable when the doctor checked him.
But now he is not breathing.
The baby belongs to the Jindal family.
I will call you back, Pandit Ji.
The doctor has already informed the family that their son is healthy.
They are powerful people.
I am afraid they might blame me.
Let's exchange their son with mine.
Even we were blessed with a son today.
And who would understand this joy better than me?
I've been working for them for years.
I owe them everything I have.
This sacrifice is too small compared to their favors.
What about your wife?
How will you convince her?
God will bless us with another child.
We cannot do this. It's wrong!
No.
A good deed can never go wrong.
Never.
Let's go.
Pick him up.
Pick up the child.
We are doing a good deed. Don't be afraid. Pick him up.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
Come on.
He is alive.
Thank God!
Look, sir.
Give him to me.
Now he is mine.
No, sir.
It was supposed to be a sacrifice.
But you are being deceitful now!
Deceitful?
His father and I joined the company together.
We drove to the office together on my scooter.
But somehow he was able to charm Jindal's daughter.
From an assistant, he became their son-in-law.
And I remained an employee.
Now, while he rides in luxury,
I still get soaking wet riding my old scooter.
Because he was lucky.
But this child…
He could have cried
when we exchanged him with my son.
But he cried after we exited the room.
Why?
Because he is unlucky, like me.
Now he will lead an ordinary life,
and my son will live like a king.
This is worse than betrayal.
-It's a sin. -Shut up.
Don't snatch a child from his mother.
I won't let you do it.
-Give me the child. -Let go. Don't make a scene.
I will tell everyone.
-I will tell everyone. -Who will believe you?
Valmiki. I've been blessed with a son.
-What about you? -Me too.
Great. Congratulations.
Congratulations.
All okay?
Yes. I just sprained my leg.
-Take care. -Yes.
Sulochana! Lift her!
My son.
Our son.
I am running out of patience. What's the name of my future successor?
Raj.
Raj Nanda.
Raj!
Raj Steels.
Raj Cargo.
A true prince!
Raj…
Do you like the name, Valmiki?
Absolutely, sir.
Perfect name for the successor of this empire.
Have you decided what you will call your son?
Are you serious?
What kind of name is that?
It's absurd.
I will never allow you to call him this.
Poor kid will become a laughingstock.
And it also damages my reputation.
Goodbye!
-But… -Pandit Ji!
Listen, Pandit Ji…
Pandit Ji!
Bantu?
It sounds like the clanging of dishes.
-Bantu. -Why?
Lord Ram calls Lord Hanuman "Bantu" and still he is worshipped.
Don't try to use this logic with me.
Lord Ram and Lord Hanuman are different.
Who will this boy serve?
What is this?
Only nine marks in math?
So what if madam gave you less marks,
I'll make up for it.
And uncle Valmiki has a similar pen.
What are you doing, Valmiki?
Looking at Raj's report card.
How much did he score in math?
Take a look.
97.
Bravo, son.
Well done.
Can you guess Bantu's score in math?
-How much? -Ninety-eight!
Gosh, lost out by two marks.
You should have scored 100 out of 100.
Don't be so mean.
He has scored such good marks.
Nobody remembers the guy who gets out in his nineties.
Only centuries count.
Some are just born unlucky.
Very sad.
The prince
What are you doing here?
Don't worry. This is just a dream.
Also known as nightmares in English.
Do you remember everything?
Of course.
Twenty-five years ago you changed this little guy's fortune!
I was destined to be a king.
Instead, I became a miser like you.
Time for you to wake up.
Stop watching these fancy dreams
and go make tea.
Bloody child swapper!
The prince
The prince
Dad, your tea.
Keep it downstairs.
Thank God!
If he is busy snoring here,
that means my son's living like a king in his palace!
Unbelievable.
How can he look so happy for a guy who lost everything?
Hey!
Hey!
Get up.
Grandma sent pickles. Go collect it from the station.
Go on.
Not fair, Mom.
You are so warm and loving in my dreams.
But in reality, I've to endure his sarcasm.
How could you leave me alone with this grouch?
Miss you, Mom.
Hey.
I guess that's Kumar here for his money.
Tell him I am not at home.
Is your daddy at home?
Daddy?
Daddy, Poppa, father, pop…
Is any of them at home?
Oh, that guy.
He said to tell you that he's not at home.
You are a disgusting man!
Asking your son to lie!
Shameless.
I'll be back in the evening for the rest of the money.
Why didn't you make him sit on my lap instead?
All you had to say was "Daddy is not at home".
Call your dad.
Daddy is not at home.
And he's definitely not behind the wall or under the table.
And that's final.
You are such a lowlife!
We are middle-class people.
Being completely honest and moralistic will make us misfits in society.
Your simplicity will get us all killed someday.
If I tell the truth, I'll be afraid only once.
But if I lie,
I'll be afraid till I don't get caught.
Bravo, Bantu.
Thanks, sis.
Here. Coconut and camphor.
And where is the garland?
We don't have it.
You guys forgot to get the garland.
He's returning from America after completing his graduation.
Useless.
He didn't win any medals.
It took him six years to complete a four-year course.
No need to glorify his blunders.
It's okay, sir.
Dad. Seven years.
Seven?
Embarrassing!
-Hello. -Are you at the station?
Grandma sent pickles for the entire neighborhood.
Keep it aside.
And get a garland immediately to Jindal sir's residence.
Is Jindal sir getting married at this age?
Stupid. I just want a garland.
-Garland. -Who is getting married?
Your dad!
Stop, uncle. I have arrived at my destination.
Hey.
-Where do you think you are going? -Relax.
It's heavy.
Not your cup of tea.
I've been carrying you around for ages.
This is child's play. Hand it over.
I've been observing since childhood.
You never let me in.
What is the problem?
Son, this is heaven!
The only way to gain access is to earn merits or die trying.
Some are just born unlucky.
Very sad.
Raj has arrived!
Raj has arrived.
He has a place for everyone in his heart except for me.
Thanks, Val.
Welcome, home.
Grandpa.
Hey, Dad.
Welcome back.
I made your favorite kheer.
I hope it's made of almond milk, Mom.
Master Raj, the kheer is made from the milk
-of our in-house cow, Elizabeth. -Elizabeth?
We moved heaven and earth to get her here from the Swiss mountains.
Even he's traveled 12,000 kilometers.
Yes, I am extremely tired.
CP, please.
Listen…
All the best, brother.
Hope you get the job this time.
Focus on your studies.
Let's go.
Did you not see what happened?
I would understand if they were girls.
But what will those boys do with your pink veil?
People should steal stuff they can use.
Someone misbehaved with your sister,
and that didn't make you mad.
Relax.
You are expecting too much from me.
I am getting late. Bye.
Next year on Raksha Bandhan, we can switch roles,
so, I can protect you.
Because clearly, you couldn't!
That hurt my ego.
If you ever want to get a job done by a man,
just hurt his ego.
Where will I find them now?
Everyone says
My sister is one in a million
Hello, Nisha.
Sorry for overreacting, brother.
Doesn't matter. I found your veil.
How?
We haven't decided yet.
Brother, that pink veil belongs to my sister.
Your sister is damn hot, man.
Thanks, man.
Please return the veil.
We'll return the veil, in exchange for your sister.
The prince
Veil.
No…
Veil.
When you said, "Your sister is damn hot.",
I wasn't upset at all.
She is a beautiful girl.
In fact, I was happy that we will have to spend less on her wedding.
That's how we think. Middle-class mentality.
But then he interrupted like an '80s villain.
"My sister in exchange for the veil."
Who talks like that?
He broke my heart.
I lost my mind when I realized
You entered the lanes of my heart
Which floor?
-Your floor. -Sorry…
Thirteenth… floor.
13.
Legal Eagle.
Fooled you too, right?
I am 21 plus.
I am an adult.
The office is called Legal Eagle.
All the best.
Best. Best. Best.
I am madly in love
I can't stop loving you
Are you applying for the post of paralegal?
Yes, ma'am.
Bantu.
Government Law College, Amritsar.
Most of our applicants are Howard and Cambridge graduates.
You don't stand a chance here.
I am sorry.
Rejecting me without seeing my merit.
Not fair.
Okay. Come in.
This is Harmeet. My client.
He wants to divorce his wife Simran.
You can defend Simran, and see if you can get us some alimony.
You have five minutes to showcase your merit.
What?
Our life cannot be his audition.
Relax.
If he is any good, I will hire him.
Back to the case.
My client Harmeet has accused his wife Simran,
she was a simple girl when they got married.
But Harmeet's lifestyle and fortune changed Simran's personality.
She calls herself a "socialite" now.
She uses me like an ATM. Gold digger.
Who else will spend the husband's fortune if not the wife?
The neighbor?
Until now, Rashmi has never asked me for anything.
Then why do you like, share, and comment on every Insta-post from her?
Like a stray dog.
Excuse me. Just mind your language.
So, there is still some hope.
Sister-in-law is suspicious about him, which means she loves him.
You have complaints because you still have hope.
Even I have complaints.
I wanted to continue working after marriage.
But his father has a rule.
Chadda family women never go out to work.
Ms. Samara.
Will you continue working after marriage?
Of course.
If an educated, talented, disciplined,
cute, hot, gorgeous, long-legged…
I kick pretty hard.
Sorry.
You see…
Women today like to work even after tying the knot.
So get with it, Harmeet.
Let her be self-reliant.
Can't work, can't have kids.
How can we be happy?
By trying.
First, take care of each other,
and then the baby.
And the thing about babies is, they are like love.
Never plan it,
let it be natural.
Love each other so madly,
that the child comes naturally.
If you have any other problems, you can write to me.
bantuka4@gmail.com
Now go and reproduce.
Brother, thank you for this.
So, what time should I come tomorrow?
You don't have to.
Being a lawyer you acted like a relationship counselor.
You just lost me a client.
I am rejecting you based on your merit.
You have no future here.
Get out.
What are you doing?
Bag.
It's nearly a week since Raj came back.
I haven't seen him. Where is he?
Master Raj left his room ten minutes ago.
Master Raj has arrived.
Master Raj.
Your avocado on sourdough toast.
There's a guy called Sarang.
Sarang deals in toys.
And uses our cargo planes to export them.
One day our hangars were raided.
And Sarang's real business was exposed.
So we banned their company.
And his business shut down.
He is sending his brother to get the ban lifted.
And your dad is sending you to say no.
Sir. Tea?
No.
It's easy to say no to a waiter.
But equally difficult to a powerful man.
Son, if you can pull this off--
Then you will earn respect.
This is your test.
My son doesn't need to give any tests.
Just be yourself, Raj.
That's all I want.
Uncle Kailash, I am feeling a little uneasy.
Don't worry. Your dad is with us.
-Where? -In the coffee shop, at the back.
Hi.
You guys have banned our business.
Innocent children don't have toys.
Ask him what was in those toys.
We just need a signature.
Lift the ban,
so my men can resume work.
Impossible.
Tell him.
So, what have you decided?
Say no, Raj.
Why are you mum?
Why think so hard?
We have much to do together.
We are the future of these companies. Sign it, man.
What are you doing? Keep the pen down.
Raj, say no.
Say no, Raj.
Stop laughing.
Say no, goddamnit.
Sarang.
The answer is no.
And no means no.
I will not let you use my cargo or anyone else's.
The ban will never be lifted.
Get out of my office.
Your father is a stubborn man,
but not more than me.
I will see you again.
Let's go, Vikrant.
-One cappuccino. Take away. -Okay, sir.
Good afternoon.
Samara.
Why meet here? I could have come down to your office.
By the way, thank you for taking up this case.
Mr. Kakkad, I cannot take your brother's case.
-Why? -Because he is guilty.
How does that matter?
You can always twist the truth.
We have evidence that he assaulted a woman.
What if I double your fee?
Our firm does not defend clients like him.
You must have a price.
I don't.
And please don't upset me.
Or I will prosecute your brother.
Have a good day.
Say yes…
Or we have other means of persuasion.
Although I have no business here,
but you are breaking the law.
Section 268, committing public nuisance.
Don't stick your nose in this.
Let her go, mister, or you'll be charged with section 354.
Misbehaving with a female is eve teasing.
Bloody Justice Chaudhury!
Take that.
Oh, God!
You will never learn!
Section 503, physical intimidation. Which means, threatening.
Threatening?
Take that…
Great… Section 425.
Vandalizing public property.
I think you are hungry.
Rascal, you will teach me the law!
Take this!
Guys, where is the security?
You are going in for good.
Section 307, attempt to murder.
Leave me. Let's take this outside!
Bantu, right?
Government Law College, Amritsar.
You don't need a foreign degree to learn justice.
I used every bit of my learnings today.
I will teach you the rest.
You are hired.
Thank you, madam. Thank you.
Hey, stop!
Oh my God!
Stop it, silly. Don't make me emotional.
Section 309, attempt to suicide.
Sorry, madam.
Now listen carefully.
Be it a good offer or bad,
when someone says no, it means…
No!
And when a girl says no, then it's a…
definite no!
Madam, we cannot hang around after that legal class.
When the energy is high, we should take an exit.
Good morning, madam.
What are you doing here?
Working out on my way to work.
In a suit?
While trying to keep up with the pace of life,
I've no time to keep pace with myself.
And I also save some travel money.
-I read your file. -Yes.
-People dream of going to Paris. -Yes, yes.
-Driving a Ferrari. -Yes, yes.
You wrote you never dream
because you are afraid they will be second-hand dreams.
What does that even mean?
-Do you have time? -Move aside.
Two more rounds.
Six… not done.
Dad. College starts tomorrow.
I need some money to buy new clothes.
I told Randeep's son that Bantu starts college tomorrow.
He gave me all his used clothes without saying a word.
And that's not all, Nisha! See…
He even gave me his perfume.
Smell it.
-Wow. -Yes.
I will even smell second-hand now.
A whiff of it and it feels like Raj is right here.
Do you want it or not?
Dad,
my shoes are torn.
Can you buy me these?
What is your shoe size?
Nine.
Mine is eight.
It will soften up once you start wearing it.
The shoe and your brains.
You are worse than an enemy!
Giving me his shoes! My legs will bleed.
Dad, Bantu wants a new bike.
Bantu.
I inherited this from your grandfather.
Take good care of it.
Bantu. No need to be so emotional.
Enough. Let me go.
No.
You are safe like this.
If I let go, it can be painful for you.
Madam, I never had an amazing day in my life.
I am here now.
Expect a miracle.
I lost my mind when I realized
You entered the lanes of my heart
You are the answer to my prayers
You are the answer
To my prayers
That's the dream I had
Can't take my eyes Off you when you smile
You even made the sun blush
I lost my mind when I realized
You entered the lanes of my heart
I feel lost
It's so quiet
I feel lost
It's so quiet
How did I let you convince me?
You are the answer to my prayers
That's the dream I had
I seek the one
Who understands my feelings
Doesn't have to take me to the moon
But has a heart of gold
Doesn't have to be a prince
But someone who can make me laugh
Takes me in his arms when I come home
Makes me feel like his queen
I am just an ordinary girl
But love always brings a twist
I wish there's a guy out there
Who does what I say
If I ever find him
Never gonna let go
I am madly in love
I can't stop loving you
I steal a glance…
At you
I steal a glance at you
Your face dwells in my eyes
You are the answer to my prayers
That's the dream I had
I need you
I need…
I need you
I need you
I bring 24 apples for you every year.
Two apples every month.
I bought 600 apples for you in 25 years.
As the saying goes,
an apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Only if you can eat it.
But you don't wake up.
And the apples are wasted.
You are luckier than me.
You have been lying in a coma for years.
And Randeep is paying for your treatment.
Because you delivered his baby.
Hey.
Do you understand Hindi?
I don't know.
Is there anything I can do?
We will do, we will fight, we will win
We will do, we will fight, we will win
We will win We will win
The Gita says the body is perishable, not the soul.
Forsake this body.
Be free.
It will bring peace to you and me.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Anybody there?
Anybody there?
-Doctor! -Oh no.
Doc…
-Sister, hurry up. -Yes, doctor.
Oxygen. Check her blood pressure and heart rate.
Okay, doctor.
-Keep a check on her vitals. -Yes, doctor.
-Is she going to wake up? -Can't say.
But this has never happened before.
-Can she see? -It's complicated.
-Can she hear? -I'm not sure.
-Can she speak? -Impossible.
-Thank God. -What?
I mean, thank you.
Thank you.
Why did I have to wear a sari for this lunch, Dad?
They are the Jindals, child.
I would have worn regular clothes for any other occasion.
And if they ask you if you can cook,
tell them that you were selected for Master Chef,
but you said no.
But why will they ask me whether I can cook…
Wait!
Are we here to meet their son?
What would you prefer?
I would prefer a drink.
But that would upset Samara.
Dad, it's noon.
It must be nighttime somewhere in the world.
Scotch, Gin. Glass of rosé. What would you like to have?
-How about a black rum with soda-- -Tea.
We will have tea.
Tea?
So, are we gonna see the boy, or should we elders decide?
Where is Raj?
Master Raj has arrived.
Park it.
Hello, uncle.
Wow! Swag with culture.
Not to mention the car.
Great.
The children might feel awkward in front of us.
Raj. Take Samara for a walk.
Come.
Do you have a cigarette?
No. No smoking, no drinking, pure vegan.
How sweet.
Do you have a cigarette?
I only have the local brand, madam.
Marblo Nights.
Great.
Tell me more about your family.
Just the three of us.
But the third member keeps changing.
Dad is naughty.
-Excuse me. -Yeah.
Me, my dad, and a new bottle every day.
Since mom's death, only alcohol and sad songs could keep us company.
You know, I had a girlfriend at the University.
But things didn't work out.
Have you ever been in a relationship?
Several.
Sometimes boys! Sometimes girls!
What?
Love doesn't care about gender.
Don't mind.
But even I don't want to keep secrets from you.
Do you even believe in marriage?
I have only one problem.
Why should I leave my house and my dad?
Girls have shed too many tears.
It's the guy's turn to sit in the palanquin now,
and I will come riding on a horse!
Shall we?
Mom. Dad. Grandpa.
Samara is not a woman.
What nonsense is this?
She's a wonder woman!
I am ready to be the damsel in distress.
What?
Guys, I am ready for this marriage.
Wow, madam, you're getting married in such a wealthy family.
He said yes.
How can anyone say no to you?
But I am not happy.
They are filthy rich.
Their home looks like a palace.
Even if you two fight,
the husband, and wife can sleep in separate rooms.
Where there is love,
the size of the house doesn't matter, Bantu.
I do have a small house.
Do you love me?
You belong in my dreams.
In reality, you are way beyond my reach.
One needs the heart to love not a house.
You will change your mind when you see my house.
Bantu, I really like you.
I don't believe in all that. I believe in love.
Okay.
Then let's fall in love.
Will you be able to?
Of course.
Now I feel embarrassed, madam.
Madam-- Can you stop calling me madam?
Why don't you ever wear a pant?
Sorry.
Did I hit too hard?
Yes.
But I am enjoying it now.
Madam…
Baby. Babe. BooBoo…
Call me anything you like.
Just don't call me madam.
I'll need some time, madam.
I'll need some time…
Boo Boo.
I wonder what spell you have cast on me
I am ready to follow you Wherever you take me
Since the day I met you I don't need any friends
Since the day I met you I don't need any friends
You are so cute
I would rather call you cuteness
I will take care of you You are responsibility
Tell your family, now it's my turn
You are going to be all mine now
I've taken a detour towards your lane
I am cute and you're one in a million
I am cute and you're one in a million
For you, I dumped my other girlfriend
You're so cute And I'm one in a million
You're so cute And I'm one in a million
I am cute and you're one in a million
For you, I dumped my other girlfriend
I wonder what spell you have cast on me
Let's start this love story
Come tease me, beloved
I don't say yes to everyone
But I said yes to you
I will go with you, beloved
-There is no lover like me -Is there anyone?
-I am a classic -Is there anyone?
-Is there anyone tall and dark like me? -Is there anyone?
-A crazy maniac -Is there anyone?
-Someone to challenge your dad -Is there anyone?
And beg him if need be -Is there anyone?
No fat fat, left to right
Like dhoom chak chak Dhoom dhoom chak
Last night I told my friends
I've stolen the moon from the stars
I am going to keep you away From prying eyes
I've taken a detour towards your lane
I am cute and you're one in a million
I am cute and you're one in a million
For you, I dumped my other girlfriend
You're so cute And I'm one in a million
You're so cute And I'm one in a million
I am cute and you're one in a million
For you, I dumped my other girlfriend
I wonder what spell you have cast on me
I am ready to follow you Wherever you take me
Yes, sir.
Okay, sir.
Excuse me. He is ready to see you.
Hello, Mr. Randeep.
Since the children couldn't agree,
I thought I should come to meet the father.
My decision won't change at any cost.
Randeep!
I keep extending my hand in friendship, and you keep ignoring it.
I am not scared of you.
Next time get an appointment.
Not fair, Mr. Randeep.
I've incurred far too many losses because of you.
Sarang, your toys are stealing the children's innocence.
And you, my business.
My principles are far more important than business.
Isn't there any solution?
There is.
Shut down your business.
So you won't lift the ban?
Then I must get rid of you.
My dad will never agree to this.
That's why we came to meet Raj's dad.
We will tell him the truth about us.
Worst case scenario, he will give one tight slap!
It's the least you can do for love.
There is no one here.
He is a busy man. Must be in a meeting.
Sir.
Sir. Sir.
Sir.
-Sir. -Sir.
Somebody help!
-I'll call an ambulance. -No, call his driver.
Okay.
Sir. Sir.
Shit!
Where are the stairs?
Bantu, he is losing blood.
We must inform his family.
Sir. Sir.
Hey…
Sir. Sir.
Sir.
Sir.
Open it.
That's our car.
And we stabbed him.
Let him go.
Sir. Sir.
I will inform the family.
Don't worry. I'll call someone.
Who was that?
Ran…
-What? -Ran…
Ran…
-Randeep? -Yes.
Do you know him?
Wha…
What happened to him?
Someone…
He met with a small accident.
Don't worry. He will be fine.
Is he…
Is he your father…
Unfortunately, he's not my father.
That's my father.
There.
-Tell me. -He is not…
Your father…
Ran…
Ran…
Your words won't alter the truth.
-No. -Take rest.
Please sit, sir. I'll check where madam is.
He is not your father.
He isn't.
I think you are not feeling well.
I will call the doctor.
Wait… listen…
-I'll be right back. -Hear me out.
-Please, calm down. -Listen to me…
He is not your father!
He is Valmiki.
How do you know my father?
Valmiki is not your father.
Randeep.
Randeep is your father.
I don't understand what you are saying.
I exchanged you with my own hands.
You weren't breathing after you were born.
You are the Jindal family prince.
The real prince.
I took the silver spoon from you
and changed your destiny.
My sin doesn't let me live or die.
We must tell your father the truth.
I owe this to him.
Go call your father.
I must tell him the truth.
I want to tell him that you are his son.
Call your father. Call Randeep.
Call him. I want to tell him that you are his son.
Call, Randeep. Call him. I want to tell him.
-Call him. Call him. -He is inside--
Why is this patient here?
-Sister. -Yes, doctor.
What are you doing?
Why is this patient here?
-Let's shift her to critical care. -Okay, doctor.
Kailash, how is Randeep?
I spoke with the doctors.
His heart is intact, but he's lost blood.
Everything else is fine.
I don't think so, Kailash.
What about security?
What happened?
Who is he?
That's Bantu. He works in my office.
If it wasn't for him,
Uncle would have never made it to the hospital.
Thank you.
Kailash, give him some money and tell him to leave.
It's okay, Bantu.
Don't mind her.
Thank you, son.
Come.
Just give me a minute.
I've been working for them for 25 years.
But they don't even let me stay in the same room.
All rich people are the same.
They will keep reminding you of your place.
We are not their family. We should stay away.
That's how the world works!
He is the king and we are his servants.
She is no more.
Peace be with her.
-I will tell everyone. -Who will believe you?
-Did you know her? -No.
Look at her lying like an orphan.
No family, nor any friends.
This is definitely because of her bad karma.
As the saying goes… God sees all.
What are you staring at?
Do you have anything to say?
Shut up!
Out of all days, this scooter had to break down today!
Not only did you slap your father,
but you are also keeping mum.
Don't you have anything to say?
You are not my real father.
I am not your real father!
I am not your real father!
If I am not your father, then where did you come from?
Did you fall from the sky?
No.
You pulled me down from heaven and slammed me on the ground.
That nurse was in a coma for 25 years.
Are you going to believe the nonsense she says?
I never mentioned any nurse.
I am the Jindal family heir.
Randeep is my father.
Yes or no?
I've been hearing your bullshit all my life.
Speak up!
Now!
I just wanted to see my son happy.
And see Randeep's son unhappy.
So, you were punishing me for the last 25 years.
What harm did I ever cause you?
Will you tell the Jindal family everything?
Please.
Don't tell anyone.
Are you crazy?
What will I get by telling them?
Money? Wealth? Car?
Screw that!
What's interesting is,
you know that I know.
What did you get from learning the truth?
Freedom.
I always wondered,
that no matter what I do, I can never impress my father.
But now I have my answer.
Now I am free.
Free.
Valmiki.
I used to cringe seeing you.
But now I feel pity for you.
Because you can't tell him he's your son,
and I won't acknowledge you as my father!
It's the end of my exile.
Time to return home.
The prince
-Valmiki. -Yes.
I want to meet your son.
I want to hug him and say thank you.
Excuse me.
This nurse and I treated your son-in-law!
You should be hugging and thanking us.
Who are you?
Hello, I am an open-heart surgeon, okay?
For an open heart surgeon, you have a not-so-open heart.
-This is no way to speak. -Sir. Sir.
Is he crazy? Bloody oldies!
Never upset your doctor or driver.
If they twist the injection or steering wheel to the wrong side,
then it's game over.
So, calm down.
You should have been here yesterday.
Where were you?
No one called me.
Your father is in the hospital.
Do you need an invitation to come and see him?
And why did you bring a bouquet like a foreigner?
Master Raj, balloons were a better idea.
We should have gone with the balloons.
What is the billed amount?
1,20,000, sir.
Round it up to one million.
Sir, 1,20,000 can be rounded off to 1,50,000.
-Not one million. -Don't forget our old deal.
You get five percent. I get the rest.
God bless you.
Plus GST.
You're too much, sir. Consider it done.
Sir, avoid t-shirts for some time.
-Shirts will be more comfortable. -Why?
God. There he goes again.
My son-in-law looks handsome in t-shirts.
That has nothing to do with this.
And this is not fashion advice, it's medical advice.
Sir, shirt…
T-shirt.
Muscle strain.
Get it?
Anyway, he needs positivity around him.
Not negative people like us.
Like that boy who brought him to the hospital.
Call him.
-Sister. -Yes, doctor.
Here.
Great.
Your son-in-law's blood pressure has become normal,
as soon as I mentioned that boy.
See, 120/80. Perfect.
Sir.
How will his presence affect his health?
See for yourself.
But never believe an MBBS, M.D, FRCS doctor like me.
You guys keep questioning my abilities!
-Doctor-- -Don't touch.
Last time you were against him.
Now you want me to call him here.
-Answer him. -Go ahead.
Sir, just give me a chance. Even we doctors have children.
My son?
His BP will spike at this rate.
Go, get him.
He's at work.
Tell him to take a few hours off.
It's not a government job.
Tell him to take the whole day off.
They will fire him.
Tell him to quit then.
It's his bread and butter.
Send him over to my house. I will take care of his needs.
-He's talking rubbish! -Whenever I call him,
you always make some excuse. What is your problem?
No problem, sir.
-Then what's the problem? -No problem.
Then call him.
-Call him. -Call him quickly, please.
The battery is down.
Give me his number. I will call him.
I'll call him.
Listen, Jindal sir wants to meet you.
But I won't let you set foot in here.
Like the gully boys say,
"My time will come."
But your time will never come.
As soon as you hang up, the doctor will call me.
How do you know the doctor is inside?
Where are you?
Check outside the gate.
I am here to stay for good
I will be everyone's favorite
What did you do with the doctor?
He didn't want to look at you earlier,
and now he's asking for an appointment.
Relax.
When you kidnap someone's child,
he's bound to react like that.
Did you kidnap his son?
Yes. That's him.
SUPERHERO
-Hello. -Is he coming?
Yes, sir. He is.
You have been seeing your son for 25 years.
Now I will meet my father for the first time.
With little dreams And years of accounts
Everyone's friend is here
Take a good look, make some noise
I am here now
From rags to riches Like a spear of destruction
He is reaching for the sky
Shining so bright Put your glasses on
Witness his glory now
I am here to stay for good
I will be everyone's favorite
I am not innocent nor naive
But I am your best friend forever
I promise, I will be…
The prince
The prince
The prince
The prince
I am the… prince
The prince
I've longed to be back home
It's been a decade now
I can feel the love shower On me as they open their hearts
I can hear laughter on one side
and sighs coming from another
This is where I played my games
I can feel the blessings of my mother
Someone will finally feed me
My childhood will return
One with a true and kind heart
With the key to your destiny
He is called
The prince
The prince
The prince
I am not innocent nor naive
But I am your best friend forever
I promise
I will be…
The prince
The prince
I am the… prince
The prince
My son is here.
Where is my son?
-Relax. -I cannot.
He is at the ice cream parlor.
I'll leave in a jiffy.
I didn't pay for the ice cream.
I will.
He also has my headphones.
I'll buy you new ones.
Who kidnaps a fat kid?
Bloody criminal.
Your father kept you away like some treasure.
We never met.
Come here.
You have strong arms.
That day, you didn't just save my son-in-law,
you saved this family's honor, the Jindal empire,
and our pride.
You work for Raj's fiancée, don't you?
-Yes, sir. -Does she pay well?
The contract said 25,000.
But after deducting taxes I get 3000 in hand, sir.
I will give you 50,000. Tax-free.
Come work for me.
Sir, you are spoiling him with more money.
He will get spoilt if you give him,
but I will make him someone worthwhile.
Will you come to work for me?
Of course, sir.
Choose any room, with a desk and computer.
But what will be my job?
Exactly, what can he do?
He will hang out with me.
I am a lonely old man.
Right, buddy?
Yes, buddy.
Buddy?
You don't know what you are saying!
I have a lot to do.
I have to meet the other rich people.
Share a cup of green tea with Jindal sir.
I am busy, Valmiki. Get lost.
Rascal.
Can't believe all this is mine.
You know I am a simple man.
I don't like to lie or cheat people.
Unbelievable, sir.
Preaching what you don't practice.
I have a lot to learn from you.
Who are you?
Bantu, with love.
And in hatred,
still Bantu!
-What is this? -Eggs Benedict for master Raj.
Master Raj's eggs.
Make the same for me, starting tomorrow.
But I will have ten eggs.
Okay.
He looks like the scrambled egg type.
Get me a cup of tea!
Excuse me. I am not a servant.
I am Arun.
A family member of this family since 1990.
Why didn't I see you earlier?
Because I am the busy type.
I have my pilates classes.
Can I? Thank you.
These rich people are so weird.
Butlers dressed in suits, owners dressed in shorts.
-Sir. -Hey, how did you like the house?
Like paradise.
It's so beautiful that I feel I am dead.
But I didn't like one thing.
You guys are not united,
that's why he was attacked.
By the way, what did the police say?
We filed a complaint,
but Sarang is an unpredictable guy.
I don't deal with guys like him.
But I can.
What?
Let's go talk to him.
Shall we?
Didn't you say you wanted to hang out?
Right, buddy?
Sir!
-Who are you? -Grandpa.
I mean, he's as old as your grandpa.
You use his planes to smuggle your goods around.
But you don't know who he is.
The founder. Aditya Jindal.
-Show some respect. -How did you guys get to Mauritius?
We flew.
I flew business class, and my buddy was in first.
Though we had a smooth landing
but faced some turbulence when we got here.
Get the car.
Let's go back.
No, sir. We came all the way.
How…
Same feeling.
The hand print.
Who pushed him?
That boy saved Randeep.
But who will save you?
"The prince."
The prince
Pick up the crates. Hurry up.
Who pushed him?
Where did he come from?
Who pushed him? Who?
Who touched him? Tell me.
-Was it you? Did you touch him? -No.
-Did you push him? -No, I didn't push him.
Did you push him?
How dare you!
Who touched him?
How dare you touch him?
Yes?
Gather uncle's stuff.
Hurry up. Give it to me.
The prince
Chilled coconut water. Especially for you, sir.
Eau de cologne towel, sir.
It will calm you down.
Who was it? Who pushed him?
What do you think, sir? We all pushed him?
You already punched the guy who pushed him.
There he is.
Folded up like a new Samsung phone.
Where is your boss?
He is inside. But you need to yell to call him.
Sir!
It's very clear.
He says your brother is a scoundrel!
But his case is weak
because he doesn't have evidence.
I came here and threw your men around like ping-pong balls.
There's no proof of that, as well.
So, henceforth no more violence.
That's all we had to say.
Buddy, that's the end of our hangout. Let's go or we'll miss our flight.
Are you going to say something or just stare, son?
You can write if you don't want to say it.
bantuka4@gmail.com
Shouldn't this boat be in the water?
It's a car, Bantu. Not a boat!
What is this model called?
RR.
Looks like it's Rajamouli's car.
The tuxedo and the car look rented.
Can we take a selfie before I give you my two cents?
Nice umbrella.
Don't let me get my hands on it.
I can be reckless with it.
Let's go, we'll miss our flight.
This car is a beauty.
You should get a couple of these, buddy.
You called, sir?
Bantu, come.
We haven't spoken since you got here.
Tell me, sir.
What you did for a total stranger is commendable.
Thank you.
If not me then who else?
But I am no one to you.
You are.
What?
Boss.
You know, Bantu.
The most difficult battles in life,
are the ones against your own family.
What did my son-in-law say?
A lot.
He's mad about the dispute with my daughter, isn't he?
He's bound to be.
They haven't spoken for seven years.
Did he say anything else?
He didn't, but you just did.
Buddy, this family has issues.
During tough times, your family is your strength.
But when your own family leaves you stranded,
who do you turn to?
Hey, Dad.
Morning, uncle J.
They are beyond help.
And he will never understand.
He is a weird guy.
No one knows what's on his mind.
Just for once, I want to see him explode with anger.
Then I can die peacefully.
He will explode, and you don't have to die.
You know, buddy.
Poor had only one thing.
Grief.
And the rich took over that as well.
Hey, you have work to do,
and you are out here smoking.
Don't do that. These people are naive.
So naive that you swapped their baby.
Valmiki, I am the owner of this building, this garden, and you.
Talking in English feels better when you are dressed like this.
Now get out!
Otherwise, I will deduct your salary!
-Hey! -Hey!
Get lost.
Get lost.
Come on.
Rascal.
Dad first brought Randeep
and gave him the entire business.
And he's been torturing us ever since.
Now he's got this new guy…
Who will screw us sooner or later!
There is something about him.
We should offer him our friendship.
Nice boy.
An everyday expenditure worth 1,50,000?
Twenty-five thousand on fuel.
There are several cars in the office.
Twenty-five thousand for snacks.
We have several poor employees.
Fifty thousand for coffee.
Are we buying Starbucks?!
I am discussing accounts,
and you are winking at me.
They did.
And I forwarded it to you like a WhatsApp text.
Why did they wink at you?
Because 1,00,000 goes to their personal account.
But why did they wink at you?
They made an offer to me, as well.
A cut in the home expenditure.
Hand me my cane.
Why?
So, I can beat them up!
-Let's chase them. -Uncle please, trust me…
-What are you doing? -Yashu…
-Yashu… -What's going on here?
Uncle is beating us up because of this outsider.
What happened, Dad?
These two are siphoning money from the company account.
They have a share.
Who told you this?
-Him. -And how do you know he's not lying?
Because he never lies.
I see.
So, you only speak the truth?
Why will my brother steal from his own company?
He earns two million every month.
He spends two million at the bat of an eyelid on IJL.
IJL?
"Indian Jua League."
He's the Chris Gayle of IJL.
Do you gamble?
Only on weekends.
-Only on weekends. -Yeah.
Because he's busy with Sheena on weekdays.
Who is Sheena?
I don't know.
Are you guys going to believe everything he says?
Sheena sent a text on your phone.
"Call me once free."
You dropped it while trying to escape.
So what? I'll call her when I am free.
He's creating unwanted controversy.
I see. In the end, it says, "Miss you baby."
-Baby? -Yes.
And she also sent a kiss emoji.
Show me.
Don't, sir. These pictures are too explicit.
-Really? -Yes, his.
Kiss and heart emojis are so common.
In fact, uncle, I even send it to my driver.
Why are you people overreacting?
Where were you when he was doing all this?
Normally you are always glued to him.
Are women ever going to change?
When she couldn't slap her husband,
she slapped her younger brother.
So outdated, man.
Bloody leech.
Oh no. Time's up.
Goodnight, sir.
Goodnight, madam.
Look, child.
Don't ask any stupid questions.
I mean, how did you get stabbed or where?
How big was the knife?
They won't tolerate such small talk.
-They are rich people. -Hey, Samara.
Long time, short skirt. Cute.
Who is he?
Dad, this is Bantu.
My assistant.
Personal assistant.
But, why is he getting so personal with you?
He was looking for the key.
Here it is. Park the car.
Haven't told your family yet?
Told me what?
Your daughter has no interest in Raj.
-What? -Actually, we are deeply in love.
How deep?
So deep,
that someday you might have to get us married, Dad.
Why is he calling me dad?
Samara's dad is my dad, as well.
Come on, Samara. Always embarrassing me!
Let's go.
-Blessings? -Move…
Keep walking, and don't look back.
Morning, Inspector.
Is Jindal sir at home?
He's gone out. Anything urgent?
The Commissioner wants to know whether Randeep needs security?
He doesn't need any security as long as I am here.
Who are you?
Bantu. I work here.
What work?
The usual. Bantuka4…
Netflix and chill on free wifi.
But who are you to make decisions about his personal security?
Actually, I am Randeep's real son.
It's true, sir.
If he's Dhirubhai, I am his Mukesh.
If he's Mufasa, then I am Simba.
If he's Amrinder, I am Mahinder.
-Dhoni? -Bahubali.
Morning, Officer.
Hello.
Who is he now?
For the last 25 years, they believe that he is their son.
25 years?
And when did you find out?
-Recently. -How?
The nurse told me.
She and the guy hiding behind the pillar who looks like a pickpocket,
who's eavesdropping on our conversation…
Together they swapped me with Raj.
I got this pathetic life,
and that avocado became their heir.
And you saw this with your own eyes?
No, sir. I was only six hours old then.
-The nurse told me. -When?
Just now.
Why didn't she tell you this 25 years ago?
-Because she was in a coma. -Then why tell you now?
Because now she woke up from her coma.
Why did she tell you?
Who else could she tell?
Why not tell Mr. Randeep?
She was going to.
Then why didn't she?
Because the poor soul died before she could.
Wait a minute.
Does anyone else know about this except for you?
Yes, sir. You do.
But I will keep this a secret.
I will sacrifice.
If you are so big-hearted, why come here?
This is my house.
If I don't look out for them, then who will?
Bantu, give me the keys.
I've to get to the office urgently.
See you in the evening. Bye.
Who is she?
His fiancée.
If you're happy And you know it clap your hands
Why was she kissing you?
We are in love!
Does that avocado know about this?
Come on, sir.
If he knew, why would he marry her?
If you're happy And you know it clap your hands
Does Mr. Randeep know what's going on in his house?
We were going to tell him, but then this happened.
And because of which, now you are here.
Good morning, Inspector Yadav.
Sir, do you run background checks on your employees?
Of course, we do.
Then why did you hire him?
Yadav, this family has everything,
except for one thing which this boy has.
What?
Brains of a businessman, the courage of a warrior.
Hope to never see you again.
This is not your car.
Okay.
I guess I will have to resign.
Thanks for coming in last minute.
Sir, I know all the romantic spots in Delhi.
If madam and you want to go?
Maybe after dinner. What say, Samara?
Don't mind, but you two look cute as a couple.
Thanks, Bunty.
Bantu.
But since you're my boss, you can call me anything.
Where do you plan to stay after the wedding?
Home or abroad?
Anywhere except for Wuhan!
-Sir… -What are you trying to do?
You want me to get married to him?
That's what you want?
Bantu, I am tired now.
Why are we hiding it if we haven't done anything wrong?
Do you both know each other?
Yeah.
We used to secretly hold hands in the office.
We played footsie.
Actually, we are madly in love. Aren't we?
Footsie.
Where did you all play footsie together?
-When did this happen? -Wait for a second.
I am talking to you.
Why don't you say something?
-How? -Like this.
What?
It's a good thing the driver didn't show up,
or I would have never found out.
I am so sorry, Raj.
We should have told you earlier.
Actually, we tried to tell you, but, other things came up.
I really didn't mean to hurt you.
Hey, it's alright.
These things happen.
I have dropped a text to Cadbury.
He said he's gonna make me a chocolate milkshake.
Always makes me feel better.
And you two look nice together.
I am happy for you guys.
All the best.
Is that it?
You are convinced?
Pardon me.
You are so easily convinced? Doesn't this make you mad?
I don't know.
How could you not know if you are mad or not?
That's the problem with rich kids.
Everyone's confused.
Either about love, career, or emotions.
But you cannot be blamed for this, it's your family.
When you were supposed to ride a cycle,
they flew you in airplanes.
Other children went abroad to study,
you went there for vacations.
Look at yourself.
At home, you're a mama's boy,
your uncles, and your servants accompany you to work.
Your father has no confidence in you.
And you have nothing in common with your grandpa except for his surname.
You use a dinky car to go from one room to another in your own home.
But you cannot be blamed for this.
You demanded one toy, and you got an entire shop.
You asked for change, and they gave you a credit card.
You asked for milk, they gave you Kheer, that too, with almond milk.
Now that's nepotism.
Who are you?
Don't you have dreams of your own?
Your fiancée kissed me,
and you're confused about whether you are mad or not.
I am.
I am getting mad.
Then fight for your identity.
Attack your family. Take charge.
Won't look nice if I attack my family.
Not a real fight.
Show him who the real Raj is.
-Mom. -Are you asking for chocolate?
-Dad! -Think bigger.
-Granddad! -Lose respect.
Grandpa!
-Little more. -Jindal.
You are Sunny not Bobby.
-Jindal… -Now you are Dharmendra.
Bloody Jindal!
-What happened, my son? -This…
This love is how you snatched away my personality.
Life is so comfortable that I hardly have any problems.
So, what is the problem?
-What's the name of your grandfather? -Kishenchand.
Bloody Kishenchand's son.
Hey, Kishenchand's grandson!
How would you feel if someone addressed you like this?
What rude behavior is this?
I has been facing this all my life.
"I have."
Funny.
See? Even my Hindi is bad.
My immunity is low.
All I have is virtual friends.
And this is your fault.
What is wrong with you?
My eyes have opened, Mom.
Thanks to Bunty.
Grandpa was the only one who asked me what I want to be.
When I said I want to be a chef,
you guys said "Aww, so cute" and laughed at me.
I wanted to try photography, and be a pilot.
But son, you can't be everything.
But I can try.
But you guys are so rich,
you didn't give me a chance to struggle.
Because if I failed, you guys would be embarrassed.
Mom, if I had topped the university,
what would I be?
The Jindal Group's CEO.
And what if I had returned without a degree?
-The Jindal Group's CEO. -Exactly.
I've been noticing all my life. You guys know how to give orders, not ask.
No one asked Samara if she wants to even marry me or not.
You just said she should be happy with my decision.
My decision!
Hello! She loves Bunty.
Samara and Bantu?
Yes, they have been having an affair, and you know what, honestly,
I am happy for them.
I was sinning.
I am not a love breaker, Mom.
From now on I'll make my own decisions!
Hope that's okay.
Cadbury, get me your finest scotch.
Yes, master Raj.
Your Raj has grown up.
You're smoking cigarettes in the garden after canceling my son's wedding!
They were all mine, to begin with.
As for your son,
if I tell everyone the truth, he will be kicked out.
Kicked out.
His mother will become his boss, his father his CEO,
and an ordinary servant like you will become his father.
Rascal!
Me?
You are a rascal, Valmiki.
Bloody child swapper!
Don't spoil my mood. Get lost.
Out. Out.
Your beauty is going to peak in the next two years.
Oh, stop it! Is that what you see here?
Do you go to the gym?
Yes? True Fitness.
You are going to find true love in True Fitness.
Do you know anyone with a big heart and bigger biceps?
Yes.
Jatin.
My trainer.
He was Mr. Vasant Vihar.
Very soon he will pop the question.
-What? -Shall we go…
away from this Mount Kailash?
In the valley of my biceps.
Are you blushing?
Stop this nonsense!
-This Bantu will ruin my marriage. -No!
He is a home breaker.
No, that's not it.
And who is Jatin?
Jatin is my trainer…
Read.
That's all for today. Come with me.
No, Dad. Go ahead.
I don't need to see your hand.
-It's all written on your face. -What?
You don't get along with your husband.
Come, Bantu. Get up.
Come.
Wait, Dad.
Why do you feel that way?
The doors of your room are always closed.
Why are you so interested?
Whether their doors are closed or not? How does it matter to you?
When the couple is newly married, one can understand.
There is much to talk about.
But if the doors remain closed after 30 years of marriage.
That means there is silence inside.
Regardless of how busy sir is,
he makes it a point to return by 6.
To prove that this family means everything to him.
But he does this, not by will,
but out of guilt.
What guilt?
Ayesha.
He had an affair seven years ago.
And since then you two have been living like this.
You don't want to fix the relationship or part ways.
Unfortunately, everyone knows about it,
but no one wants to talk about it.
Why? Because you fear society.
Buddy, you could have said something.
Or at least get them divorced.
What do you think?
Telling the truth will make you great!
If a lie can save someone's life,
it's better than the truth.
If you ever love someone,
you will know how important a lie is.
The true strength of love lies in honesty.
Try telling the truth, sir.
It will be painful,
but it will fortify your relationship.
It's six o'clock, sir. My time is up.
Goodnight.
It wasn't her fault.
It was yours.
You were married.
You had a family.
And what was my fault?
That I always gave my best to this relationship?
For the sake of our love,
I went against my father.
I fought against the entire world.
And you broke my heart in return.
Guilt alone doesn't pardon your mistake.
You have to apologize for that.
Randeep,
you couldn't even say sorry in seven years.
Don't you think I deserve that?
I was ashamed to look you in the eye.
To talk to you.
I was ashamed of myself.
It took me long enough, isn't it Yashu?
Forgive me.
I am sorry.
Hello.
Why isn't my daughter reacting?
They fought for seven years.
Give them five minutes.
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.
I am sorry, Yashu.
They are hugging, buddy.
Congratulations, buddy.
Get some rest and let me have my dinner in peace.
Cadbury, what brings you here?
Good morning, Bantu.
All good?
Jindal sir sent this for you.
Said he'll be very glad if you can attend.
Don't be late.
COME HOME
The things you do tickle my heart
Your mischiefs bring me joy
The things you do tickle my heart
Your mischiefs bring me joy
Everyone's here
Looking elegant
Make every heart skip a beat
Oh, yes
Climbing over the walls The boys are here
Glow like the moon And light up the night
Every moment
I don't spend with you is a waste
When you held my hand Leaving the world behind
It gave me an overwhelming feeling
The things you do tickle my heart
Your mischiefs bring me joy
The things you do
Tickle my heart
Your mischiefs
Bring me joy
Believe me when I say That I prayed
The dreams of my loved ones to come true
Every breath I take, Is another praise for you
There is no dearth of it
Since I've been blessed with your love
It gave me an overwhelming feeling
The things you do tickle my heart
Your mischiefs bring me joy
The things you do tickle my heart
Your mischiefs bring me joy
I want to ward off the evil eyes
Of the apple of my eyes
I can't stand it
If any harm comes to them
The things you do tickle my heart
Your mischiefs bring me joy
The things you do tickle my heart
The auspicious evening has arrived
But I am a little scared
If this evening comes to an end
I will die
Hello, aunty.
Shall we?
I am fed up now.
All I wanted was a simple signature
so that my men could return to work.
Now sign the documents,
and send your son over to the location I sent you.
Along with shares worth 50 billion.
This is an old cliched threat.
But if you call the police,
you will never see your wife again.
Raj, you won't go.
This is risky. I will deal with him.
-Give it to me. -Dad, I will go!
I can do this.
Raj,
he is right.
A man like Sarang cannot be trusted.
You are naive, son.
You know nothing about the real world.
All I know is when it's about my mother,
we don't discuss, we act.
Where is my mother?
What happened here?
The breeze was blowing slowly.
Old songs were playing on the radio.
My boss was preparing to leave the country.
His brother was drinking on the rocks.
The guys were busy playing cards.
With great expectations, we were looking at the gate.
Everything was going as planned.
In the next 15 minutes,
we were supposed to receive shares worth 50 billion.
And then…
The wind turned violent.
Songs became muffled.
We were hit by a storm.
A hurricane!
I am worried.
We shouldn't have let Raj go alone.
He will be fine.
The prince
So silky.
Which shampoo do you use?
You little back alley rodent.
You always show up to defend this family.
What is your relationship with this woman?
A child's first home,
a boy's first love.
The most pious relationship in the whole world.
What?
Don't ask questions in the middle of the action.
Oh no, just missed it.
Why do you carry an umbrella all the time, brother?
Now you made a mess.
Who is this, Bantu?
Where did he come from?
No one knows.
He blew away the guys
and our expectations!
I brought him home because I knew the truth.
He is your son
and the heir to Aditya Jindal.
I thought he will tell the truth to get this house,
the money, and the business.
But no…
he doesn't want anything.
Valmiki,
do you have anything to say?
Nothing, sir.
In case my son has unintentionally made any mistakes,
please forgive him.
That's all.
Is that all?
Yes, sir.
That's all?
Is that all, Valmiki?
Is it?
He is my grandson.
My blood.
He is my successor!
You took him away from us and now you're choosing to keep mum.
I heard the nurse talking to him in the hospital.
Ever since I found out what you did,
I have controlled myself.
Why didn't you get mad?
I pity him.
He has two sons, but no one to call him father.
The joy of swapping the children soon turned into fear.
He hasn't slept peacefully for last 25 years.
Let him go, sir.
You aren't upset with any of us.
You have no greed.
Then why come here?
Parents are not the only ones who wish happiness for their children.
Children want to see their parents happy, as well.
But when a mother has been deprived of joy,
how can a son be happy?
As long as I am here,
how can I see my father weak?
How can I see my grandpa in pain?
When I realized that you guys are going through a difficult time,
I couldn't just stand by.
Those who abused my father behind his back
will fall at his feet.
My mother will be his best friend.
Randeep can never lose and I won't let him.
I came here
to turn this place into a real paradise.
My job here is done.
I don't want anything else, sir.
I told you…
I told you how my son will be.
Just like him.
Exactly like him.
Exactly like him.
Sir, please calm down.
Calm down.
Calm down, Dad.
Say that again.
Dad.
Calm down, please.
Come on, let's go see Yashu.
-Let's tell Yashu. -No.
Don't do that.
What about Raj?
What will you tell him?
Twenty-five years ago he separated two children from their mother.
Rectifying this mistake will separate another mother and son again.
As your son, I request you.
Please don't break my mother's heart.
Bantu,
you are one reality I don't like.
Because you are better than my son.
Women can accept a stranger as their husband.
But their children can only be the ones they give birth to.
Today
when you arrived instead of Raj,
you not only saved me…
but him, as well.
And anyone who protects
and defends my family
is just like a son to me.
Thank you, Bunty.
Did I do the right thing?
You always do the right thing.
What happened, Valmiki?
Why do you look stressed?
You should be happy.
Your son has made you proud.
What years of foreign education couldn't teach Raj,
you taught it to Bantu in the old alleys of Delhi.
Make my Raj just like your Bantu.
Let him start from scratch.
In fact, let him stay with you.
And, in the next five years,
transform him from a clerk to the CEO.
It hasn't arrived yet?
I guess the bus is running late.
When I was a kid, you frenziedly told me stories.
But your lap was the only place I could fall asleep.
You can't walk properly,
but you taught me to sprint.
My grandpa simply loves my rude personality,
and it's all thanks to you.
They may have brought me into this world,
but you raised me.
Was it a compliment or sarcasm?
I learned that from you, as well.
Compliment wrapped in sarcasm.
The Jindal family grandson's riding a scooter.
It's 125cc. Gives the best mileage.
And one doesn't have to worry about changing gears. What else can one ask for?
Good for you!
It's not mine.
It's yours.
Mister, can I get a lift?
We are headed to the same place.
Wait.
Valmiki take a left and right and stop at the food stall.
We'll have an egg wrap on our way home.
The chickens are going to curse you. How many eggs are you going to eat?
That's not necessary, ma'am.
Come on.
It's clearly a case of theft.
There were two people involved.
They thought it was an empty house and broke in last night,
but the landlord caught them.
There was a fight.
This guy tried to defend himself.
But the two overpowered him.
They stabbed him and fled through the back entrance.
After that--
Yes.
It rained all night, so the roof has leaked.
Check the surroundings. We'll catch them by evening.
You've got it all wrong.
-Jai Hind, ma'am. -Jai Hind.
Is this how you investigate a crime scene?
-Where are your gloves? -Actually…
That's SI Shivani Mathur.
The Commissioner has appointed her.
He entered through the main door.
The first struggle happened in the living room.
Then the victim ran upstairs to escape.
The killer picked up a vase and threw it at the victim.
The victim fell on that piece of glass.
Then they struggled to overpower each other.
Finally, the killer used a weapon and murdered the victim.
-Did you find the weapon? -No, ma'am.
And then the killer started to cover up the crime.
He got rid of all the evidence and put the body in the bathtub
and poured water on the floor,
to get rid of the footprints and fingerprints.
If there was a leak in the roof, there'd be a visible mark!
There's only one set of footprints.
So, there was just one attacker.
He definitely entered through the main door.
Then why did he exit from here?
The suspect has a smart criminal mind.
He has knowledge of forensics.
Looks like a well-planned murder.
All criminals are bound to leave some evidence behind.
Jai Hind.
It's just impossible.
Of course, there are police officers who can't find the evidence.
Kesla, you're getting fat.
-Sorry, sir. -You should go jogging.
-Body? -Please come, sir.
Sir, that's Aakash Sardana.
Who else lives here?
It was just him, sir.
His sister lives in Saharanpur.
We've informed her. She'll be here soon.
Good. What about the weapon?
We are yet to find it.
You won't find it.
Sir, the wounds are quite deep.
A sharp and pointed object was used.
It's not a regular knife or dagger.
I assure you, we'll have a profile of the weapon by evening.
Sir, I think--
Kesla, order some tea.
-Hey… -Sir, here's your tea.
Wow, Gupta!
-Yes? -Sir, I think the motive is personal.
You think so?
Look, SI Mathur,
we work on the basis of hard evidence, not mere assumptions.
The Commissioner has personally appointed you for this case,
so carry out the investigation, find the evidence and bring me the report.
Sir!
I don't know that, ma'am.
Tell me what happened last night.
Ma'am, I finished my work and left at 6:00 p.m.
He was fine at that time and was watching TV.
What kind of a man was he?
He was a good man, ma'am.
He was not very social.
He'd keep to himself all day and work on his computer.
Any enemies?
Who all are there in your family?
It was just me and Aakash.
We lost our parents long ago.
Was Aakash associated with any wrong people?
No, ma'am.
He hardly knew anyone here.
He returned from the US just four months ago after his divorce.
Divorce?
He always wanted to settle down in India, but his wife didn't.
What was his occupation?
He wanted to have his own tech start-up.
He even withdrew some money from our family account recently.
How much?
Around 20 lakhs.
Ma'am, there is no cash.
The CCTV hasn't been working for two months, ma'am.
Did anyone visit Bungalow No. 22 last night?
No.
Some drunks were causing a commotion on the road around midnight.
Come on, move it!
I made sure nobody entered the compound.
Check the register for entries from last night.
Summon the owners to the station for questioning.
Yes, ma'am.
-Where were you on Wednesday at midnight? -We were at home,
but we sleep at 10:00 p.m.
No, ma'am, I wasn't there.
That's my holiday home.
I only go there for vacations.
We were at home. It was our movie night. We've bought a new home theater.
I was out of town. I returned this morning.
Did something exciting happen in my absence?
Do you know Aakash Sardana?
What kind of a person was he?
I used to see him during our morning walks, but we never spoke.
No, ma'am, I didn't know him.
I've seen him in neighbourhood gatherings. Nice guy.
We've seen him at the gym sometimes, but we never spoke.
He is very handsome.
I'm sorry. I mean, he was.
I was planning to introduce him to my niece,
but then I found out he was divorced!
Did you see anyone or hear anything in Bungalow No. 22?
No, ma'am.
I see. So, someone used to live there?
Ma'am, give me time until evening. I'll find out.
Next.
Ma'am, this is Mr. Mehta, from Bungalow No. 21.
The one next to Aakash's bungalow.
Speak up.
Yes, ma'am…
I…
I was there Wednesday night.
But I swear, we didn't see anything.
We?
-It was my girlfriend's birthday. -Okay.
So, I was spending some time with her.
You don't have time for your family, but you have time for your girlfriend!
Sir.
Show me your phone.
Sir, it's been two days, and I wonder what Ms. Mathur is up to.
-If you want, I can-- -Come on, Kesla.
What's the problem with being a spectator for once?
Let her enjoy her enthusiasm.
It's not her cup of tea, sir.
-We still haven't found a lead. -Sir, we have a lead!
There was a couple in the bungalow across from Aakash's
on the night of the murder. I checked his phone and found this.
Two kids are taking selfies to update their profiles, so?
Sir, zoom in on the left side. That's Aakash's balcony.
This photo was clicked on Wednesday at midnight.
I've forwarded the photos to the headquarters.
The criminal will be identified shortly.
Arjun Sehgal?!
Sir, do you know him?
He's 28 years old. He's an engineer by profession.
Lives in Sector 22, Gurugram.
-Kesla. -Yes, sir.
Confirm his address with the Aadhar database.
Go, get him.
-Forward the photo to me. -Yes, sir!
Arjun Sehgal…
You're done for.
-Arjun Sehgal? -Yes?
Come to the Sector 30 police station for routine questioning.
Hey!
Listen! Open the door!
Why was I brought here?
They called it routine questioning, but it's been five hours.
Ma'am, what is all this?
They've confiscated my phone. I want to talk to my lawyer.
We will return it.
We will return your phone and summon your lawyer as well.
Sir, what do you want from me?
What's your problem with Aakash?
Who is Aakash?
Aakash Sardana, Bungalow No. 22, Greenfield Society.
I don't know anyone named Aakash Sardana.
Where were you on Wednesday, the 2nd, at midnight?
I was in my office. There was a party.
Hey, that's…
You left the party early. Why?
I had an important registry the next morning.
I wasn't feeling well.
Hold on.
You had to sign a land registration the next morning…
but you didn't show up.
Why did you lie?
I don't lie.
I cancelled the registry because I wasn't feeling well.
What are you trying to frame me for this time, sir?
Speak up! Come on, speak up!
Tell us everything clearly.
Kesla, please stop.
Are you trying to kill him?
So, you left your office party at 10:30 p.m.,
and it takes half an hour to reach your house.
But according to the CCTV cameras in your building,
you reached home at 2:00 a.m.
Where did you go?
My car had a flat tire.
Where did that happen?
On Noor Manzil Road.
Kesla, does it take three hours to change a tire?
It's a 20-minute job, sir.
My jack was broken, and there was no mechanic around.
It was raining heavily, and nobody stopped to help.
Weren't you carrying your phone?
The battery was dead.
Finally, a taxi driver stopped by and helped me.
Give me the taxi company's details.
It wasn't an Ola or Uber taxi to get all the details.
He's playing smart, sir!
Help him up.
Come on.
Aakash Sardana was murdered on Wednesday night.
He was stabbed multiple times.
Why are you telling me all this?
You don't know Aakash Sardana…
and you have never been to Bungalow No. 22 in Greenfield, correct?
Then what were you doing…
on Aakash's balcony that night?
Your game is over.
Case closed. Everybody, out.
You can't escape this time.
Forget about your career and love life.
I'll make sure you spend the rest of your life in jail.
That's not my photo!
The ACP is trying to frame me.
-Return my phone! -Kesla, close this case.
File the charge sheet.
Sir, there's a problem downstairs.
Why is there a crowd?
What's so serious?
-Sit down. -Shut up!
Sir, this is Ronnie. His full name is Sooraj Rana.
He's drunk.
The Border Patrol caught him.
He misbehaved with the policemen.
-Hey, come here. -Let go of me!
He even slapped one of them.
The SHO over there saw the circulated photo of him
and sent him here immediately.
Hey.
The one in pink?
Jahnvi Behl. She reviews movies for AT Online.
Since when have you been reviewing her?
Every day at 8:50 a.m. sharp, I get a chance to see her in the elevator.
If I miss the elevator, I don't see her until the next day.
She knows that I look at her.
By the time we reach the tenth floor, it's just me and her.
Then just awkward silence for the next two floors.
Do you guys speak or just maintain silence?
Yes, we spoke yesterday.
I finally asked her.
Can I take you out for a cup of coffee?
No greetings, no introduction. A coffee date directly?!
I can only ask one question in five seconds.
If you say yes to coffee, then we can introduce ourselves there.
Why are you building up the suspense? What did she say?
So?
Your question is wrong.
Ask the right one, and maybe I'll answer.
Wrong question? Pal, I've heard of wrong answers,
but since when did questions start going wrong?
Okay, bye.
You're a feminist, aren't you?
Why should only guys ask girls out on dates?
So, would you take me out for a coffee?
I'm sorry, the question is still wrong.
Is it about the equality thing?
Okay, let's just buy each other coffee.
Would you like to share a coffee with me?
Sharing is caring!
Hey, give me a clue.
There's an old saying in Himachal
that goes, "a girl will lead you on even if she isn't interested in you."
She is just mocking you.
You're just having fun, right? Killing time with me?
You can't crack the question, and you're blaming me.
By the way, the offer is still valid.
Can we go out for a coffee?
Can I take you out for a coffee? Will you take me out for a coffee?
Your question is wrong.
Ask the right question, and maybe I'll answer.
Oh, shit!
Excuse me.
Would you like to have some tea?
The one served in earthen cups?
Couldn't you just say that you prefer tea?
Were you having fun misleading me?
Absolutely! I was having a blast!
-By the way, I'm Arjun-- -Arjun Sehgal.
Civil Engineer from IIT Delhi, MBA from RIT Bengaluru,
lead designer at Pyramid Heights,
lives in Gurugram, travels by metro.
You own a blue BMW, but you only use it on weekends to show off.
You work on the seventh floor,
but you go up to the tenth floor every day just to hit on me!
You're a stalker!
-Should I file a police complaint? -Go ahead!
Tea.
-To stalkers. -To stalkers.
-Hello… -I feel more alive
Why did you call me here so late? Are you all out of your minds?
I'm sorry, brother.
The situation demanded it.
Who is this troublemaker?
He's a new client!
Is he trustworthy?
I don't know about trust,
but his business is booming in the market.
Oh, hello! Welcome! I'm Kulbhushan.
This guy?
Were you waiting by the door? You entered at the correct time.
It's my congenital problem.
I'm very particular about time.
Where are the goods?
You may leave now. You too.
What is this?
Send them away! We don't want any police trouble!
-There are TTC cameras everywhere. -Please listen.
-Don't you know? -We cut the TTC camera wires.
We also cut the wires of the lights.
We even put a fake number plate on the vehicle.
Nobody saw a thing.
There's no chance of getting caught, sir!
We planned every detail. It's totally safe.
Why have you come to me if you have everything planned out?
We've uprooted the machine, but the model is new.
If we open it forcefully,
the machine will turn all the notes black.
You must have got a hack, like a mechanic or something.
-Are you sure there's money inside? -At least 20 lakhs, sir.
How do I believe that?
I guess you don't watch the news, sir.
Take a look, sir.
Right now, we are reporting from the JPU ATM on the Manesar Highway.
As you can see, the entire ATM machine has been uprooted and stolen.
It is said that this gang steals these machines
shortly after they are reloaded.
Today, the machine was reloaded with approximately 24 lakhs.
Will the police be able to catch this gang?
Keep watching Asal TV. I am Mona Awasthi, with Cameraman Ashok.
There's a guy who can open it.
But the loot will be divided equally.
All right?
Done.
Call your guy.
I don't have him in my pockets.
Do you see the time? Leave the machine for now.
I'll call you tomorrow after he cracks the machine.
Do we look like pizza delivery guys?
Come on, Ronnie.
Forget it. Let's go.
-Bro, are you crazy? It's a good deal-- -Hey, stop!
Now, there are two more people
who know that you've stolen the machine.
Let's hope it doesn't make it to the news tomorrow.
"Two ATM robbers caught!"
Give that to me, bro.
Here are two lakh rupees. Keep it. It's a matter of trust.
We'll settle the remaining accounts after cracking the machine.
Okay?
Don't overthink it.
You shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.
Done!
The machine will be opened in my presence.
Done!
What was he saying? The machine should be opened in front of him? Look!
He isn't here.
Open it, bro. Hurry up. What is the problem?
Why have you brought a toy, sir?
The notes are fake.
You…
Scoundrel!
These are fake notes!
Do you think we are stupid?
I'll get you abducted right away!
I'll massacre your clan! You have no idea what I'm capable of!
Sir, why are you being so disrespectful?
You've got the wrong news. I'm sending you the right one.
So, it is considered that a bank-- Not a bank.
Who brought her?
Deliver the dialogues properly.
Come on, try again.
You just hold the camera. Hold the camera.
You taught me not to look a gift horse in the mouth.
That's what I did.
So, it's called Fifth Avenue Condos.
There is a total of ten units, all 3BHK premium luxury apartments.
So, what do you think?
It's really nice, but what are we doing here?
This is my company's first construction.
Are you serious?
Arjun, that's amazing!
I've been working on it for three years, you know.
It's been my dream.
Sometimes, I feel like I've become over-ambitious.
Arjun…
people are afraid to start working toward their dreams,
and you're scared after almost completing your dream?!
I've invested all my savings in this.
I've also taken out a loan.
If this fails…
You can't plan every outcome of your life.
Besides, what's the fun in doing something if you already know its result?
Take us for example.
If you already knew I'd like you back,
wouldn't you have missed out on the joy of asking me every day?
Everything will turn out fine.
Just believe in yourself.
I was eight when my father died.
Sometime later, my mother remarried, and we moved to Dubai.
I did move there…
but it never felt like home.
Now, I hardly talk to my mom…
except for messages on birthdays and New Years'.
But she is happy there with her new family.
That's why I came back.
There's something here…
that gives me the feeling of being home.
What's wrong, Chaddi? Why are you so sad today?
Nothing much, brother. I am missing my dad.
Do you see this shop? It belonged to my dad.
I took over the shop after he passed away.
Chimanlal Electronics.
Why are you lying on the sidewalk when you own the shop?
They've sealed the shop up!
What did you do?
I didn't do anything, bro.
I used to sell phones and tablets in bulk.
Sometimes, I'd put a bar of soap in the boxes and sell them.
Everyone does it.
Once, I sold it to the wrong guy.
The guy looked like an idiot.
He looked worse than a security guard.
But his brother is the ASI in the Sector 25 police station.
You are so screwed!
Brother, I started begging for forgiveness…
offered him free phones, but that scoundrel filed a case.
He says he'll send me to jail for sure.
The final hearing is scheduled for tomorrow,
and the lawyer says I'll get a four-year sentence. I am ruined.
Chimanlal, do you have the case file?
By now, the jailer must be picking a cell
to put me in.
You know what they'll do to a tender and handsome guy like me in jail, right?
Mr. Sharma, I have come to request an out-of-court settlement.
No, we don't want any settlement.
This is a case of cheating.
He has already decided that an example must be made out of him.
Sir, please forgive me. You seem to be my dad's age.
-Forgive this child-- -Hey, get off! You? A child?
How much do you eat every day? Look at his bulging belly.
I'll make sure he goes to jail.
All the evidence is against him. Let's go.
-Come on. See you in court. -Sir, please…
What evidence are you talking about?
Who are you?
Have you read the case file?
-Let me read it for you. -Hey--
-Listen… -Hey!
Exhibit 11.
This seizure memo only says
that the police seized 30 fake iPad boxes from my friend's shop.
Yes, it's still a crime to steal fake iPads.
Yes, but in the seizure memo, it doesn't say fake iPads were found,
it says fake iPad boxes were found!
My friend is a scrap dealer.
You only get empty boxes at a scrap dealer's shop.
This is not a case of cheating.
Is he right?
Agree for an out-of-court settlement quietly,
or there will only be empty boxes in the court.
Let's go, man!
Is he right? Listen, sir!
I agree that my friend has a bulging belly,
but he eats his bread with dignity!
Two weeks?!
But you were going to Mumbai for three days!
Yes, for the college reunion. But then, I'll go straight to Dubai.
So, you're going to miss my project opening next week?
-Why the Dubai plan all of a sudden? -It's my mom's tenth wedding anniversary.
I haven't seen her in four years. She wouldn't be expecting it.
It'll be a nice surprise for her.
You should also come with me.
We could tell her about us.
What? Doesn't your mom know about us?
Of course, she doesn't.
She sends me photos of guys every day. Marriage prospects, you know?
See…
this is today's photo, a doctor.
Really? Wow!
Heart surgeon in Australia!
-Wow! Impressive! -Arjun--
But he looks a bit old, and he's bald. You deserve better, Jahnvi.
-Give me my phone. -Listen to me. One minute.
Next one, an investment banker in Canada.
He's a banker, he's boring. No magic--
-Arjun, give me my phone! -Wait.
Check this one out. Rehaan Khan, aspiring actor.
His hobbies are cooking, traveling, and movies.
Jahnvi, movies! He is the one. You should marry him. Wait, Jahnvi.
If you don't like this guy, we'll find someone else!
You put the lawyer in his place!
You're amazing!
Cheating, fraud… I even got to see your lawyer personality today.
Where did you learn all this?
Are you praising me or dissing me?
I'm praising you, brother.
These days, people hesitate to help others.
You're my God, you know?
Nobody can harm me as long as you are with me.
Whom do you work for?
Your wife.
You're barking up the wrong tree.
I did exactly as your wife said.
Ronnie!
We are in trouble because of the ATM incident!
Hey, buddy.
Give me a puff.
Oh, it's you!
You got fooled so badly the other day.
Do you know about a split tongue?
The tongue keeps working even when it's split into two.
It's obvious that you've taken it personally.
You should've done your homework before messing with me.
Do you see this price tag?
It's approved and certified throughout Delhi.
I will sell his assets one by one and recover my money.
I'll even sell this fat for interest!
Is that okay?
Why are you looking at me? Get him!
You…
You scoundrel!
Chaddi!
Chaddi?
Chaddi!
Chaddi!
Chaddi.
Chaddi.
I'm giving you seven days.
You said 20 lakhs, so now, you'll have to give me the entire 20.
Why just 20?
For Chaddi, I'll give you 25.
Really?
You've said it, so consider it done.
-Oh, my! -My back!
We're in trouble, Ronnie!
How do we arrange 25 lakhs?
Can I help you with that, ma'am?
What are you doing here?
Are you coming?
-Thank you! -What…
Hey, relax.
I am not coming with you,
I just came to walk you to the gate.
What? Why?
I wanted to talk to you.
Come on.
Tell me now.
I don't like that earthen cup of tea.
I hate it.
It feels like dirt in my mouth.
And those foreign movies that you take me to…
I find them boring. How do you watch them?
Ever since you showed me those marriage prospects…
I've been thinking that maybe there is someone better for you.
You know that magic…
we don't have that made-for-each-other feel.
Did you come all the way just to say these things?
There was no need to come here with your sad face!
Let me finish… I feel at home only with you.
So the question is…
will you let me be at home forever?
I love you.
I love you.
Listen, I bought a ring for you, but I lost it on the way.
I wanted this to be perfect!
It's okay. Give it to me when I return.
But make sure to ask the right question.
Last chance to board the flight.
Think about it.
-Bye. -Bye.
Staring doesn't change fate, or the cards.
I'm not staring, I'm just keeping an eye.
Come on, show us.
Hey, wait!
Give it to the rickshaw driver.
-What now? -Auto!
I told you you'd lose my two lakh rupees as well.
I don't want to interfere with Lakhani's matter.
You guys better return the money, because it's mine.
The fatso got lucky.
I almost had him this time.
Shut up, dude!
We are the ones in trouble.
We've lost everything we had…
and you're only concerned about yourself.
Chaddi?
Chaddi!
Hero, you've lost the money.
Shall we start searching for ways to exact it in the meantime?
We still have two days left.
What were you so busy with for the past five days?
Are you planning to beg for money in these two days?
You have a problem with me.
Yes, since you're not afraid for your own life,
I thought you would worry about your friend's.
Give me the money in two days, or you'll get your friend in pieces.
Got it? Hang up now!
-Surprise! -Surprise!
Guys!
All the units at Fifth Avenue Condos have been booked in just 48 hours!
Here's to the man of the hour, Arjun!
Thank you, guys,
but the credit goes to all of us.
So, here's to all of us. Cheers!
Yes, brother.
-Can you arrange for some money? -Buddy, it will take me a week.
Check your safe once.
You should've asked sooner. I made a payment just now.
-I'll return it in a couple of days. -What will you pledge as security?
My business hasn't been doing well. Why don't you ask Titoo?
Why did you have to mess with Lakhani?
No one will give you money.
I'm sorry.
Bro, I'm leaving.
What? It's your party, man.
I have an important registry in the morning.
You continue and make sure that everyone gets home drunk.
-Cool? -Okay.
-See you, bye. -Bye.
-Bye, guys. -Bye.
-Bye. -Bye.
Put him in the storeroom.
Sir, are they twins?
Their names are different.
One is Sehgal, and the other is Rana.
One is Sehgal, and the other is Rana. WELCOME TO VANSANT NAGAR POLICE STATION
-Hey, Biju! -Yes, Dhiru?
-Can you come to the station? -Right now?
Yes, now.
Hurry up.
Where were you on the night of the 2nd?
Chaddi--
She didn't ask what you were wearing. Where were you?
Chaddi--
Let me finish speaking.
Chaddi is my friend's name. I was at his shop.
Write down the address.
Chimanlal Electronics, shop no. 39, Gaffar Market.
Phone no. 98211096.
Hey, brother--
You have a weird taste… carrying a ladies' handkerchief?!
Should we bring some lipstick and makeup too?
Send this to the lab for a DNA test.
How do you know Aakash Sardana?
Is he your husband?
Hey! Give a straight answer, or--
Or what? She'll hit me?
Aren't you running your mouth!
DK Basu versus the State of West Bengal!
Rules laid down by the Supreme Court
prevent custodial abuse of criminals and suspects.
What did he say?
Physically assaulting anyone in custody is a criminal offense.
You…
Ramsagar Yadav versus the State of UP.
A person subject to violence in custody finds no witnesses
barring policemen who have a bond of brotherhood.
In such situations, not only the assailant
but all the officers on duty at the station
will be considered accomplices to the crime!
He sounds like a lawyer.
We are going to get in trouble.
Rathi, beat him up.
Gupta, beat him.
Oh, come on!
You--
Nilabati Behera versus the State of Odisha.
If any mark of injury is found on the suspect's body during police custody,
then he is entitled to compensation.
You all will be suspended, while I get a compensation of two to four lakhs.
Can I get another handkerchief?
What happened, Dhiru?
Come, I'll show you.
-Do you remember Arjun Sehgal? -Yes.
He is the prime suspect in a murder case.
We've recovered a photo of him from the crime scene.
Wow, you got lucky. Let's have a drink.
Wait until you see the complete picture. Come on.
He is his carbon copy.
Do you understand my problem now?
This photo is of no use now.
I know that, Biju. Give me a solution.
You're the lawyer.
You know I've been looking for a chance to get back at Arjun for eight years.
I'll retire in two months. I think now is the chance.
It's better to retire with respect than to get suspended for something foolish.
Damn!
Biju…
try to understand. Find a way out.
Who caught the other suspect?
The Border Police Station. Why?
That means they already have a record of his arrest.
Here's what we'll do.
Delete the entry of Arjun's arrest,
so there won't be any record of him coming here.
Then what?
Look, Friday is over, and the court is closed on Saturday and Sunday.
The magistrates take complaints on the weekend, but I'll handle it.
If we go to court without evidence, their bail will be confirmed.
So, you have time until Monday morning.
Bring any evidence you can find against Arjun in these two days.
Just two days.
Who do you think is the killer, ma'am? Arjun or Sooraj?
-I wasn't feeling well. -You know…
-he hardly knew anyone here. -I don't know Aakash.
It's a sharp and pointed object…
It wasn't an Uber or Ola, so I don't have any details.
-The Border Patrol caught him… -Ma'am, the ACP is calling you.
One murder, and two suspects, who are lookalikes.
They must appear in court on Monday,
which means we just have Saturday and Sunday
to find out whether it's Arjun or Sooraj in this photo.
Rathi, make sure they don't meet anyone from outside.
Gupta, don't give them anything to eat or drink until they tell the truth.
-Yes, sir. -And the most important thing…
they shouldn't find out about each other.
Otherwise, the case will get further complicated.
-Do you understand? -Yes, sir!
Let's go.
Take your clothes off.
Take your clothes off.
How did you get this injury?
I scraped against an iron rod at the construction site.
Take your clothes off.
Hey, don't get too cocky. Remove your shirt first.
How did you get this injury?
I was riding my bike after getting drunk
and lost control.
Match the injury photos with the murder weapon's profile.
Yes, ma'am.
Ms. Shivani, how are you?
How is everyone at home?
It would be nice to hear from you every now and then.
Did you take a look at the crime scene photos?
You're talking about work again.
I haven't seen the photos yet,
but I am presenting something even better for you!
We found a hair sample on the victim, Aakash Sardana's fingernails…
and the DNA from that sample doesn't match any of Aakash's known contacts.
-So, it could be the murderer's DNA! -Yes.
Send me the DNA samples of the suspects.
I'll solve the case in two minutes
and get you a distinguished service medal.
Have you lost your mind?
The samples were sent long ago.
I haven't received any sample, ma'am.
Where will you take me after I get there?
I'll definitely take you for a stroll.
Trust me.
Sorry, ma'am.
I'm leaving right now.
Mr. Chhaba, I'm sending them now, and I need the results today.
Why is he barking at both of them? He's trained, right?
I don't know, sir. Either the samples have been tampered with,
or he is detecting the scent on both suspects.
Mr. Rathi, we need to find a connection between these two and Aakash.
Meet me at Aakash's house in one hour.
Do you know him?
No, ma'am.
Have you heard the names Arjun Sehgal and Sooraj Rana?
No, ma'am.
Have you seen him?
-No, sir. -Here…
Let's go.
Do you know this person?
-No, ma'am. Is it him? -It's possible.
We're still looking into it.
Have you heard the names Arjun Sehgal and Sooraj Rana?
Sooraj Rana… No.
If I find anything, I'll let you know.
I'm seeing this person for the first time.
What happened, ma'am?
There was a murder on Wednesday at midnight.
I have the killer's photo as well.
You know him, don't you?
Ronnie? Murder?!
No, ma'am! It can't be! Murder--
We got drunk and passed out here on Wednesday night.
It was our celebration week.
What were you celebrating?
Speak up!
Well, I had almost lost my shop…
but Ronnie saved it.
How? Did he give you money?
How would he have any money?
He helped me win a case in court.
He came up with a few points that left the lawyer dazed.
Ma'am, we inquired the neighbors.
They say these two are frauds.
They mostly work outside the city.
Not at all trustworthy.
Oh, come on…
How long have you known him?
Answer her quickly!
For two years, ma'am.
What did he do before that?
I don't know, ma'am. We never talked about it.
-Did you notice something, Mr. Rathi? -What?
He was quite chirpy while praising his friend,
but he started stuttering when we mentioned the murder. Keep an eye on him.
He shouldn't leave the city.
Okay. Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, Bhalla. Did you find anything? -Yes, ma'am.
This is the movement of Aakash's phone for the whole month,
and this is Arjun's.
There is no intersection between the two.
Ronnie and Chaddi's mobiles are registered under someone else's name,
and they are using a week-old SIM card.
There is no connection established yet.
Found anything on Facebook, Instagram, or any other social media?
No, ma'am. We checked their emails too, but found nothing.
Arjun mentioned his alibi location.
Yes, ma'am, Noor Manzil Road. We have the footage.
This is the in-time of the car…
and this is the out-time.
So, clearly, the car was on Noor Manzil Road for about three hours.
The whole day went by, but you guys haven't found any evidence yet!
Where are the DNA and forensic reports?
Will someone speak up?
Sir, we just received an update from the lab.
They need some time to send the forensic reports.
The money trail indicates theft as the motive.
Oh, spare us your academic knowledge, Ms. Mathur!
You won't be able to do it.
Kesla!
Hey, speak up!
-Did he say anything? -Sir, nothing yet.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Why did you kill Aakash?
I didn't kill Aakash.
-You… -Kesla, wait.
You've cooked up a nice story.
You are the one cooking up stories. I am speaking the truth.
But just the last time, you will fail.
How dare you…
Mr. Rathi, bring the keys to Arjun's car.
Look. We can do this all night.
It's in your best interest to confess.
No matter how much you beat me…
I won't make a false confession!
Damn you!
This is broken.
My jack was broken.
Arjun is telling the truth.
Let's go.
According to Section 42--
Yes, I know.
But this method leaves no trace.
Go ahead, file a complaint.
Why were you leaving the city last night?
Why? Is leaving the city a crime?
On the night of the murder, you were found drunk in Gaffar Market,
and your friend is the only witness.
Ma'am, if you don't trust me, then you can trace my phone location.
Go ahead, do that.
Someone who knows that phone locations can be traced
wouldn't carry his phone while going to commit a murder.
This is your last chance.
-Got anything to say in your defense? -I am a human being, after all.
How many times do I have to prove my innocence?
-Sir. -At Kanchan Jewelers…
Cross-check this information.
Mr. Rathi, come in.
Sit.
Why was Arjun saying that the ACP is trying to frame him?
Ma'am…
It's a personal matter, ma'am.
Eight years ago, the ACP's daughter eloped with a boy.
The boy was from a different caste,
and the ACP is very strict when it comes to caste.
The friend who helped them run away was…
-Arjun? -Yes, ma'am.
The ACP and his lawyer friend framed him.
They filed a kidnapping case claiming that the girl was a minor,
and that the boy abducted her with Arjun's help.
But the ACP's daughter turned out to be brave
and testified in favor of Arjun in court.
The highlight is that the ACP still doesn't know where his daughter is.
He only wanted a chance to get back at Arjun.
He's got that chance now, so he won't spare him.
Hello.
Aakash's murder case is solved, Ms. Shivani.
We have a DNA match!
The murderer is already in your custody.
Whose DNA is it? Arjun's or Sooraj's?
These are two samples, from two different people?!
Yes. Two different suspects.
Ma'am, you need to come to the lab right away.
This isn't something we can explain over the phone.
Hey, get up now. Here's some water, drink it.
Hey, get up.
The police station looks deserted in the morning.
Come, sit here.
Stay put until I get back!
Come on, get up now.
Get up, come on.
Rathi, catch him! Hey!
Ma'am, this DNA was found at your crime scene…
and this is sample no. 1, which you sent us later on.
Perfect match!
So, it's Ronnie. What's the problem?
This is sample no. 2.
This is also a perfect match!
This is also a perfect match! What?
Ma'am, the most surprising thing is
the samples match 100 percent with each other.
How is that possible?
Nobody's DNA is a 100 percent match, not even a father's and a son's.
There's one case in which the DNA matches perfectly, ma'am.
In the case of identical twins.
-Hey, bring him. -Take him there.
Take him there!
Hey, come on.
-Come. -Get out.
-Bring it on! -Lock him up.
Get lost!
Sir, what is the issue here?
Do they know each other?
-Let me call Ms. Shivani-- -No!
Let's call the ACP.
Are your suspects identical twins?
Sooraj and I are twins.
We are twins…
but not brothers!
So, there's no scientific way to establish
which of the two is the murderer.
There's one thing that's different even in the case of identical twins.
Fingerprints!
We've already checked the crime scene--
Ma'am, you know how the police team checks the crime scene.
Let me send my team over to check again.
Even if we get half a fingerprint, the case will be solved.
You guys, go and check the living room,
and you guys, check upstairs.
Come on, guys, quick!
Checking here for fingerprints again? We won't find anything.
Hey, love, how are you?
I'm visiting Delhi in two days. Keep yourself free.
What? You're coming?!
Listen, give me a kiss for now.
-Hey, what happened? -Just a minute!
-Just one-- -Hey, where did you go?
Did you go out of network coverage?
Let me go outside. Hold on.
This is better.
Hey, there's nothing here. Go inside.
Yes… this is good.
-Great! -Got it.
Good coverage--
Don't try my patience, I won't call you again.
Don't feel bad, I'll give you a small teaser.
-You'll always remember this. -Mr. Gupta!
Yes, ma'am?
-What's happening? -Nothing, ma'am.
If you're done, then let's do some work.
Yes, ma'am.
Nothing's matching, ma'am.
Everything was going well at home.
We were a happy middle-class family.
But when Sooraj and I were eight years old,
mom and dad started having problems.
Nothing was going well.
They never got along.
-Arjun, wear your shirt. -Yes.
Mom, did you pay for the field trip? We have to go next Sunday.
-Yes, I-- -This month's budget is a bit tight.
Make some adjustments.
Mom, are you sure you'll pay for it?
Yes, I will pay for it. Come on, wear your shirt.
It was mom who kept the family together.
Really?
We've heard that your mom was a notorious gambler.
-He said that?! -Hey!
I'll kill that scoundrel! How dare he talk about mom like that!
Hey, sit down!
-Okay. -Move it.
I've heard of gambling fathers…
but this is the first time I'm hearing of a gambling mother.
So what if she had a weakness?
Does that make her a bad mother?
Don't you guys take bribes?
Don't you buy toys for your children with that money?
Are you all bad fathers?
Sooraj! Arjun!
When she won, we would get football jerseys,
books, and video games.
I'm sure he didn't tell you that.
She was the topper of her university and had a job in a bank.
But dad didn't want her to work.
Dad wanted her to take care of us, that's all.
Gambling again?
Everyone gossips about us.
What does it matter?
I do all this for my family. I do it for my children.
You only think about yourself! You're selfish!
Stop all this and pay some attention to the kids.
All my attention is on the kids! You don't need to tell me that!
If you were paying attention, you wouldn't be so late!
It's called ludo-mania.
An addiction to gambling!
It is a mental illness.
She needed help and understanding, not disapproval.
Is this how you pay attention? Have you seen the report cards?
And what is this?
You've spoiled him.
One is a topper, and the other--
Learn something from Arjun.
Why are you looking at her? There's nothing worth learning.
Let's go, Arjun.
Mom…
why does dad love Arjun more than me?
It's not like that.
How can he love his left eye more than his right eye?
He loves both of you.
He wants both of you to do well. Okay?
But things began to worsen gradually.
Finally, dad filed for divorce
and took custody of both of us through the court.
He proved to the court that our future wasn't safe with our mother.
Instead of helping her, he threw her out of the house.
Mom!
Please don't go.
Mom!
Mom would still meet us.
It's my birthday today. Come over in the evening.
Sooraj!
-Mom! -Arjun!
-Happy birthday, my child. -Thank you.
Happy birthday.
I've got your favorite chocolate cake.
There's a McDonald's nearby.
-Let's get Happy Meals! -Yes, Mom! Yes!
Mom, can we just cut the cake here?
We can't go to McDonald's.
Why? Why can't we go, Arjun?
Dad has planned a birthday celebration at home.
He won't like it.
Let's just tell dad that we missed the bus.
He's taken a leave from the office today.
He'll be waiting.
But Mom--
It's okay, don't fight.
We'll get Happy Meals next time. Okay, Arjun?
Let's cut the cake now. Okay?
Mom, why did you bring a gift for him?
Why do you love him?
He doesn't love you back, don't you see it?
-I'll go home and-- -Hey!
Sooraj, Arjun is your brother.
Just as you think about me, he thinks about your dad.
So, don't be mad, okay?
Now, cheer up.
I told you to stay away from the kids!
Don't you understand?
It's their birthday, Ravi.
You won't understand so easily.
Dad got a permanent restraining order against mom.
So that she wouldn't meet us no matter how she felt.
But she was still our mom.
She would obviously suffer.
And she did.
Ravi, please let me talk to them. I'm begging you.
I'm missing them very much.
I understand, but the kids are sleeping right now.
Ravi, I'm feeling lonely, and I have this weird feeling…
Ravi, let me talk to my kids once.
You want to talk to them in this state?
Do you want them to start hating you?
Do you want them to know that their mom is a drunkard?
I haven't been drinking, Ravi.
I'm just-- Just once, let me talk to my kids.
If I just hear their voices, I'll be able to sleep. Just once.
Fine, call them in the morning when you're sober.
Ravi, please don't hang up! Ravi--
She couldn't bear the pain until morning.
Sooraj changed since that day.
Sooraj, let's go home. Dad is calling us.
Go ahead, I'll take a while.
He'd get aggressive over small things.
-Come home. -Hey!
-He'd fight with me over little things. -Listen to me!
Come on, go!
-You don't understand-- -I told you to go! What's your problem?
Year after year, those fights and problems kept getting worse.
Stop it!
Hey!
-You… -Dad tried…
Stop it, Sooraj!
…but the situation was getting out of hand.
-Hey, stop! -Sooraj, stop it!
He started blaming himself for Sooraj's condition and our fights.
Sooraj, stop it!
-Arjun, step back! Enough, stop it! -Tell him!
Sooraj, stop it! I wish you were dead instead of mom!
What did he say? That I used to fight and beat people up?
He's a liar, in fact, he's always been a liar.
He is very good at manipulating people.
I am not a liar, he is.
We had to send him for psychiatric treatment.
If you don't trust me, call Delhi Psych Ward
and ask them who was admitted there for a year.
Your case will be solved right there.
Go ahead, ask them…
why he was admitted there when he was 15 years old.
They will tell you how he jabbed a pen into the doctor's neck.
The doctor almost died.
Sir, these two are crazy.
Dr. Lagwal no longer works here, ma'am. I will get his number for you,
but the incident with the pen you mentioned is quite famous.
Actually, Dr. Lagwal was strict with both of them.
One day, one of the brothers lost his mind
and jabbed the doctor in the neck with a pen.
-I'm telling you… -Hey! Govind! Get him out of here!
Remember, no one will come to save you next time.
What do you mean by one of them? Were both of them there?
Yes, ma'am. They were admitted here for a year.
Who attacked the doctor?
That is a mystery, ma'am.
No one knows.
Not even Dr. Lagwal knows who attacked him.
Why did you lie that it was just your brother who was in the psych ward?
I did not say that I was not there.
The point is that he was undergoing treatment,
he had anger issues, and I got stuck.
He is the one who attacked the doctor.
Good! He is lying, and you are falling for it!
Go on.
I went to college, and Sooraj left home without telling anyone.
He got involved in useless activities.
He used to steal money from home to gamble.
And I don't know why, but he used to steal dad's law books too.
My life was going well after my dad passed away.
My career, love life… I was successful.
Sooraj could not tolerate that.
He was always jealous of my success.
He always tried to prove that he was better than me.
And if he couldn't, he would create problems in my life.
He had just one obsession in his life…
me.
I met him four days after dad's death.
That was the last time I saw him.
He is lying again! He visited my house just a few days ago.
Are you sure you didn't lose the ring?
This is not the first time. I know he stole my ring.
I won't spare him this time.
Relax, sit down.
Sit. Calm down, listen.
Your project is opening up next week.
Focus on your work. I will handle him.
Hit him!
Harder!
Brother, they are beating him black and blue.
Had he stolen it, he would have confessed by now.
Your goons have beaten me up a lot.
I didn't count…
because I will only hit once,
and it'll hurt you forever.
Remember that, Arjun.
I should have understood it sooner.
He is getting revenge for that day.
Yes, I threatened him. So what?
Will you consider a threat as evidence?
What will you say in court?
That I threatened my brother a few days ago,
so I must have committed the murder too?
Have you ever been to court?
I know it's you who committed the murder.
Ma'am, the ACP is calling you.
Sir!
Don't believe everything Arjun says.
He's not as straightforward as he seems.
Sir, honestly, I suspect Ronnie. He's lying.
So, Arjun's telling the truth?
Does it mean that at the time of the murder,
Arjun was changing the tire of his car for three hours?
Ronnie has only one witness, his friend.
Arjun has nothing.
Ronnie clearly made a threat a few days ago. You heard what he said.
Mathur, if Arjun was innocent, he wouldn't try to run away.
Ronnie was trying to flee the city when he was arrested.
-I don't think Arjun-- -Enough with this Arjun talk!
If you're so confident that Arjun is innocent,
bring some evidence before the night ends.
Otherwise, forget about saving him.
I'm not trying to save him, sir.
But I don't know why you're trying to prove him guilty.
What am I missing?
Should be right in front of my eyes.
Did you find anything from the Taxi Union?
Nothing yet, ma'am.
Bring Ronnie's friend, Chaddi, here.
Put him under pressure. Maybe he will confess something.
If the police ask you anything, just tell them what I've told you.
Police?
And if they visit again, leave the city before they catch you.
Brother, you'll get me trapped again!
Ma'am, Chaddi is missing.
-What? -Ma'am, the shop is closed,
and his phone is switched off.
We searched his home too, but we didn't find him.
I told you to keep an eye on him, didn't I?
-Sorry, ma'am. -You had one job!
Go and find him!
Ma'am, Ronnie was under a debt of 20 lakhs
until the night of the murder…
which he paid the morning after the murder.
Oh, wow!
Whom did you rob?
Where is Chaddi?
The ACP got this information from a source three hours ago,
but he told us not to inform you.
I knew it!
What's going on here? Where is Ronnie?
What's this?
On the night of the murder,
there was a theft of jewellery worth lakhs.
Nobody has been caught yet.
Come, help a little at the counter.
Why?
What do you mean?
An amount of 20 lakhs was missing from Aakash Sardana's house,
and you paid your debt of 20 lakhs in one go the morning after the murder.
If I write this in the charge sheet,
you will be charged under Section 302.
You will serve 14 years in jail and waste away your youth.
That's why just put your fingerprints as per my instructions.
At most, it will be a case of theft, 401, 402, and 442.
Just four years.
I will get you out in two years for good behavior.
I'm sure you know this much about law.
Tell me if I'm wrong.
No, sir. You are right.
There is just a small problem.
I didn't loot the money to pay off my debt.
I won it by playing cards.
And that, too, on the night of the murder.
At Mr. Bhatia's house, in Punjabi Bagh.
I was there all night. You can check.
If you were gambling that night, why didn't you say it earlier?
Section Four, Public Gambling Act, sir.
It carries a penalty of one week to one month, and a fine of Rs. 200.
I was afraid.
Tell me if I'm wrong.
He says he was at your house on the 2nd, gambling with you.
Yes, he was here.
In the beginning, he was losing.
But suddenly, I think his stars aligned.
He played all night.
He took away the entire 25 lakhs from the table.
Will you say this in court?
Yes, of course.
Okay, you may go.
Hey, unlock his handcuffs and let him go.
-The case is closed, let's go. -Sir!
Aakash's murder case is solved, sir!
Wow, Mr. Gupta! This is breaking news!
-Sir… -I know the case is solved.
Arjun Sehgal is the murderer.
No, sir. Arjun Sehgal didn't commit the murder.
Ms. Shivani called, we have evidence!
Yes, Mathur?
Radhika Yadav Valmiki is here to give her statement.
-What's her connection to this case? -There's a connection, sir.
Arjun visited their house in East Delhi that day.
-Who brought her here? -I called her, sir.
There is something you haven't answered yet.
Why did you lie to your colleagues
that you were going for registration in the morning?
I can't tell you.
It's a matter of someone's safety.
I guarantee the safety.
96692056…
The ACP's daughter.
We needed some money.
So, Arjun came to our house to give the same.
This is about the next morning, Mathur.
The murder happened the previous night,
when Sooraj was playing cards in Punjabi Bagh,
meaning he wasn't at the crime scene.
Arjun wasn't there either.
The taxi driver who helped Arjun on Noor Manzil Road that night
was out of town for two days.
He returned today.
His statement matches exactly with Arjun's statement.
Yes, sir.
All this evidence is circumstantial.
You will not get an extension.
The court will decide what needs to be done.
CG-2005 Arjun Sehgal and Sooraj Rana versus The State.
One of you is the murderer,
and there is no doubt about that.
But even after six months of court proceedings and several adjournments,
the prosecution could not prove which one of them is the murderer.
But Your Honor--
The police department should be ashamed of their investigation in this case.
It's a blot on the working of the police department.
Knowing that one of them is guilty,
we cannot punish them both.
Our law does not allow us to do so.
The court wants to punish the guilty,
but our justice system works on the basis of evidence.
Even if 100 criminals go Scot-free,
an innocent should not be punished.
That's the foundation of our legal system.
So, with all the evidence presented in front of this court,
I have no option but to declare both the accused not guilty.
Arjun Sehgal and Sooraj Rana…
you are both free to go.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you so much for all your help.
I must tell you, without your help,
I wouldn't have been able to escape from him.
It's been, you know…
Sir, we have seen many culprits go Scot-free,
but it's the first time we don't know who the murderer is.
Ma'am, he asked me to hand over all these old cases to you.
Yes?
Jahnvi Behl?
She doesn't live here anymore.
Arjun and Jahnvi were quite serious about each other,
but when she went to Mumbai for her reunion,
I started receiving random messages from her all of a sudden.
What kind of messages?
That she's now with someone else.
That she's going to marry him.
She asked me to tell Arjun to move on.
I even showed all those messages to Arjun.
I don't believe it, Divya.
Something's fishy.
Jahnvi would never do this.
Arjun, everyone saw Jahnvi leaving the party with him.
With whom?
I'll find out. I informed Arjun as soon as I found out.
I informed Arjun as soon as I found out.
Her ex-boyfriend from college.
-Aakash Sardana? -Yes, ma'am.
Where's Jahnvi?
-What did you do to her? -Please let me go!
-Tell me! -I'll tell you!
I didn't know that you were with Jahnvi.
We loved each other.
We were going to get married.
Trust me, please. I am telling the truth.
She was going to tell you everything after returning from Dubai.
I really love her.
But that bitch only wanted you!
Want to know where Jahnvi is
and what I did to her? Here you go!
I met her at the reunion party.
I spiked her drink.
Then I took her to a hotel and did everything I wanted to.
I kept giving her drugs…
and did as I pleased.
She tried hard to stop me.
But she couldn't handle so many drugs.
I just wanted to hear her say my name.
Say it, tell me you love me.
She went on saying your name.
Arjun…
Say you love Aakash!
Until her last breath,
she thought you would come to save her!
I paid 20 lakhs and covered up everything.
Arjun and Sooraj Sehgal.
Ma'am, how can I forget them?
You…
They fought with each other like dogs.
But they had an amazing connection.
Whenever a third person came between them…
No one will come to save you next time!
…they would forget their differences
and face the problem like a team.
When I first saw you at the police station,
I thought you were going to create a new problem.
But when you--
Remember Dr. Lagwal? Same formula.
It's impossible that something is happening in your life,
and I don't know about it.
Everything was going well, and Jahnvi disappeared all of a sudden.
When I found out about Aakash's murder, I thought of asking you.
But you got arrested before I could reach your office.
Come to the Sector 30 police station for routine questioning.
Bloody idiot!
You erased the evidence of the murder and thought you'd get away with it.
I know these policemen very well.
They sniff out every piece of evidence at the crime scene.
So, in order to mislead them…
Why is he barking at both of them?
When I started following the investigation,
I found out that ACP Yadav was involved in the case. Your old enemy.
That's when I made a plan to get inside.
The ACP had a grudge against you. He wasn't going to let you go.
I'll make sure you spend your whole life in jail.
That's why I put the ACP aside and focused on Shivani.
I created such stories one after the other
that made Shivani suspicious of me.
Take your shirt off.
I lost control of the bike.
He played me!
What happened, ma'am?
What if Shivani had not helped me?
She was bound to help you.
I know you're the murderer.
And no matter what, I will save Arjun.
When I was sure the plan had worked,
I told the ACP everything.
If you were gambling that night, why didn't you say it sooner?
What if Shivani finds out about this game?
She must have figured it out by now.
She's a smart girl.
She made a big mistake because of her smartness.
She created false evidence in order to save you.
Arjun Sehgal didn't commit the murder. Ms. Shivani called. We have evidence.
The taxi driver who helped Arjun on Noor Manzil Road that night…
his statement matches exactly with Arjun's statement.
She can't do anything now even if she wishes to.
Any other questions?
Why did you do it?
For mom.
Arjun is your brother, Sooraj.
Although your dad and I are not together,
you two have to be together forever.
Remember this, Sooraj.
She loved you.
Maybe more than she loved me.
If she were alive, this is what she would've wanted.
I did it for her, not for you.
What now?
That's it now.
This was the biggest gamble of my life,
and it's over now.
I'm moving on from all of this.
What about you?
After Jahnvi, there's nothing left for me here.
I'm leaving everything behind.

Please remember that.
Now, you're in charge of this place.
Okay?
To help your mobilization,
we will provide a company car for you.
I'm afraid I have to go now.
Don't forget. If you need any help,
you can get in touch with Mr. Ujang.
-Count those three. -Yes.
-That's it. -The one wearing the green vest
and orange gloves.
Don't mistake him for a Dutch goalkeeper.
-Yeah. -Well, I'll be going now.
-Thank you very much. -Okay.
Take care.
-Thank you very much. -You're welcome.
Right. We must take care of our health.
-Please take care of your health too. -Right.
Remember, this farm,
all these cages, are just like your own home.
-Yes. -Excuse me.
-Yes, take care. -See you.
Ara, I will be working here from now on.
It will be difficult for me to take turns with Euis to pick you up from school.
She's busy these days.
So it would be better if you learn to go home by yourself.
Don't worry. I will go home with Euis.
That's her promise.
I won't bother you.
When we get home,
I'll remind Euis again, so we won't bother you.
-Arabah! -Arabah!
If that's the case, you can tell her.
No worries!
CV. UNGGAS MANDIRI - CHICKEN FARM
Ara!
What is that voice?
What voice?
Didn't you hear it?
I didn't hear anything.
Hey, Ara!
Wear this.
Do you have to work here?
This place is haunted.
What do you mean "haunted"?
You know very well I'm scarier than any ghost.
Ara, hold this.
-Come on. I'm serious, you know. -It's true.
I'm also serious, Ara.
-Ara! -See?
The voice is back.
What voice?
Did you really not hear it?
No, I didn't hear anything.
Hey, come on!
Hold on, okay?
Okay.
Ready?
-Ready. -Let's go!
So, you'll be working here?
You don't need to deliver eggs to the market anymore?
You'll stop with the online taxi driver job?
Right.
I will take care of the chickens and everything.
I will start working here.
-Andi! -Rindu, please.
-Den, stop! -Wait.
-Rindu, please. -It's Andi, miss.
What are you doing?
Just get back to work. We need to finish this.
Stop it. Come on.
Give me the chunks of meat.
Gosh.
Mr. Aa, don't be stingy.
I haven't eaten in so long.
-How come? -It's an IV drip.
You little…
Come on.
Hurry.
What was that earlier?
I wanted to give the paper--
I see.
So, Rindu the class president
and the so-called loyal friend turned out to be a traitor.
I should've known better.
Euis, you misunderstood!
Deni, you're unpredictable.
Hey, stop it.
So?
The sales are not going so well.
I'm not sure.
Agil, just a minute.
Wait a moment.
I don't know how to say it.
Look, your sister is here.
Mom, Euis is home.
Euis, please play with Agil.
I don't think I can continue. I'm afraid it won't sell.
I'll just take it.
If it doesn't sell well, I can return them.
-Yeah. -We have 57 here.
I'll take two for my kids.
Sure, take it.
Thank you.
Well, we need to go.
Okay, thank you.
You're welcome.
Me too. See you.
Bye.
Bye, Agil.
You want to open it?
Euis.
You really can't go home with Ara anymore?
Actually, I have a lot of extra activities now.
There has been a lot of group work too.
That's why I can't always go home on time like before.
After all,
Ara is old enough to go home by herself.
But it will make her sad, you know.
You promised to go home with her.
That was when I was still in middle school.
I wasn't this busy.
I see. Then, you need to talk to Ara.
Don't bother your father by asking him to pick her up because you can't.
It doesn't sell well.
People won't buy opak anymore.
Do you want to try selling opak online?
I can help take the pictures if you want.
-Would anyone want to buy it? -Hurry up! Watch out!
-I've seen people do that. -Watch out!
I will ask Auntie Salmah.
I want more.
Hey.
I'm sorry I haven't been coming here lately.
You want some?
It smells good. Euis?
Hey.
I found a way out for our business.
What do you mean by "a way out"?
So, I met an old friend of mine.
I haven't seen him for so long that I forgot him.
He used to be poor, but now he's rich.
He looks really cool.
He sold his land and started a catfish business.
I wonder how some people can make a fortune overnight
when we are trying our best to survive.
Right?
So, he wants to lend us money
to fund our business.
Is it true? How will we pay it back?
He said we shouldn't worry. We can use the money.
Who would lend money for free?
Some people would.
Who?
The person I mentioned.
I just told you. Didn't you listen?
Anyway, you don't have to worry about it, okay?
Just leave it to me.
It's hard if we only sell opak.
Just take it.
I'm home.
-Ara too. -You're here.
Mom, we didn't sell much.
Auntie Salmah, have you been here long?
Yeah.
Dear, how was it?
Dear,
I now have a new job.
Thank God.
Starting tomorrow, I will work at the farm.
Dear.
But the farm is safe, right?
At first, I was worried,
but when I got there, the place was being sterilized.
Mom.
They said they will give him a car.
-So we will have a car again. -It's a company car.
I will have to travel extensively
with a lot of chickens, so they will provide a company car.
But I don't like Dad's new workplace.
Why is that?
Because ghosts live there.
Really?
Where are the ghosts?
I will fight it.
I'm serious. I'm not lying.
Why did Ara say the farm is haunted?
-So-- -Because I heard a voice calling me.
But we could only see chickens there, right?
Right, only chickens.
Could it be the chickens?
It's scary.
Strange.
Maybe you heard it wrong, Ara.
Really, I'm not lying.
The farm where I'll be working is not a dark, scary place.
It's bright, neat, and clean.
I don't know why Ara said that.
Hey, Agil. I'm home.
You didn't greet me? Don't you want to play with me?
She's cooking.
Give me some of the food, will you?
Euis, but it's true, that place is haunted.
I don't think it was the chickens calling me.
I didn't hear it wrong.
It sounded like a chicken.
It's impossible for the chickens to call me, right?
Ara, why are you using that comb?
I'm still using it. Give it back!
Just use the other one. I like using this comb.
We have another comb.
Who are you texting?
Is it your friend, Ima?
Euis, do you want to listen to my new song?
Ara, why did you put the towel there?
Give the comb back!
Why are you so cranky today?
Who's cranky?
Just give me the comb.
Take the towel, Ra!
We only have one left?
It's all my fault that we barely have any savings left.
It's okay.
I'm grateful we managed to survive until now.
It means we have to start again from the beginning.
Thank you for staying strong, dear.
-You're coughing. -Here.
Have a drink.
Ara.
Starting tomorrow, you can go home alone, okay?
I can't pick you up anymore.
I have a lot of activities at school,
so I can't always go home on time.
That's why you need to start to go home alone, okay?
How could you do that?
You promised to always go home with me.
I always kept my promises to you.
Why did you break yours?
I know, but it was in the past.
I wasn't so busy then.
And it's a good thing
if you learn to go home alone like the other kids.
That doesn't mean we won't pick you up at all.
But if I have time or if your sister is not busy,
we'll definitely pick you up. Okay?
I also want a separate room, Dad.
Why are you so mean to me?
I've always been good to you.
Ara is sad already because she can't go home with you.
And now you ask for separate rooms.
Is that necessary?
It's not like we have to do it, Mom.
It's just that I want my privacy.
Moving rooms is not that easy.
Where will Ara sleep?
Should she sleep with Dad and I?
You know we have Agil.
I miss having my own room.
Having my own stuff.
I don't want to share with Ara all the time.
Okay, if that's what you want.
But give us some time, okay?
Cleaning the room takes time.
We need money too.
Well,
if you and Dad think the other room isn't decent,
let me use that room.
Ara can stay here.
Okay, then.
Let's see what we can do.
Mister!
Mister!
Ara!
Where is your father, Ra?
He went out.
He said you can wait.
Mom and Euis are in the room.
Why the long face?
Nothing.
Mr. Romli, do you believe that ghosts are real?
Where's the ghost, Ra?
The thing is, at the chicken farm,
I heard a voice calling me.
We know that there are only chickens there.
It couldn't be the chickens, right?
Well, it could be the chickens.
What? Is it possible?
Yes.
When I was your age, I could talk to frogs.
Maybe the chickens knew that you wanted to talk to them.
That's why they called you. Right?
You're right.
I also wanted to talk to the chickens.
See?
How come you could talk to frogs?
Well, do you remember?
-What? -That one.
The intersection near the complex of big houses.
Yes.
When I was your age, there was a pond.
There were a lot of frogs.
Like a whole family of frogs?
A whole family.
And you could talk to them?
Yes.
Every day after school,
I went there and played with them,
so I could understand their language.
But among the four frogs,
there was one frog that was the biggest and the fattest.
So it couldn't hop?
It could. Who said it couldn't hop?
The big frog was the best at hopping.
It was awesome, because
the bigger the frog, it would…
It looked like this. It pushed itself, and…
Like that!
Like, very big?
-Very big. -How big?
-This big? -About this big.
Agil, do you want to sleep?
Sleep with me.
Dear, please find some time tomorrow to clean Ara's room.
Okay, I will find the time.
Poor kid.
She was so shocked.
It's okay. She is a big girl.
She'll get over it tomorrow.
If Agil can't sleep, can you take care of her?
It's your turn.
I know, but tomorrow, I must get up early. I have to go to the farm at 6:00.
It's the first day of work.
Okay?
Agil, let's sleep.
She's still playing.
Come on. Just make up already.
It's been two days since you ignored each other.
Moss will start growing on both of you at this rate.
You'll turn green.
Gross!
Do you want that? You don't want that, right?
So, let's make up.
Do you really not like Deni?
I swear, Euis.
And if I liked someone, it would not be Deni.
She's right. She likes our senior--
He's here. Come here.
Loot at him. Over here.
CAHAYA CISARUA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
-I'll be going now. Bye. -Bye.
Just a moment.
This way. Are you ready?
Yes. I'm ready.
Let's check it out, okay?
This is your room. Look.
This is your room now.
On Saturday, when I have my day off,
I'll fix the room.
Okay?
Try it. Try to sleep on it.
You can use it already. Try to sleep on it.
I made the bed for you.
See you, Euis.
-Me too. Take care. -Take care.
-Bye. -Bye.
Why are you following me?
Nothing.
So?
Say something.
Don't be silent.
I want to apologize.
I really wanted to ask for Rindu's help,
to say…
To say what?
To say that…
I actually like you.
She told me about it.
So?
I forgave you.
So?
So?
What do you want now that you've been forgiven?
Can I ask you to take me home?
What?
I mean… Can I walk you home?
Sure.
So, where are you now?
Ara and I are in separate rooms now.
No need to whisper anymore.
Wait a minute.
What?
Euis have changed.
I don't like it.
-I like the green one. -Look.
Here's yours.
Only 10,000 for one chick.
You want it?
No?
Only 10,000.
You've been going home alone lately?
Yes.
Do you want to go home together?
Sure.
Hey, stop.
Why?
The little chicken is lost.
Are you lost?
You can talk to chickens?
Mr. Romli said I can train it.
I will take you home, okay?
No! It must belong to someone.
What if we just count to 100?
If no one comes after that,
we should take it home.
Let's start. One, two, three--
Not that fast!
One,
two, three, four,
five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten…
Wait, okay?
Just wait, little chick.
What is this? The heart?
No feather here.
Just wait, okay?
That chicken must belong to someone.
We waited for the owner,
but no one came.
Alright. Then, go change your clothes.
You can't play in your uniform.
Gosh!
Mom, Ara has a chicken! Gross! The chicken is dirty!
What are you doing with the chicken?
Come here.
Ask it if we should pick the chayote now.
Okay.
It turned blue.
Can we pick the chayote now?
What did it say?
Nothing.
I cleaned it with antibacterial soap.
It's okay. I'll give it a bath again to clean it some more.
We don't know if the chicken carries any disease or not.
It could be dangerous.
But I've cleaned it.
I know, Ara.
It's called a neon chicken.
People color the feathers so the kids want to buy it.
We can't do that to the chicken.
Poor chicken.
Right, tomorrow is Saturday.
You will fix my room, right?
Give me the cloth.
Well, wipe it first.
Let's put the chicken in here, okay?
I bought it on my way home.
There you are!
Hey.
Dear, come on. Hurry up and get ready to clean up.
Please hold Agil. I need to prepare dinner.
Okay, dear.
Dad's home.
Please clean up, okay?
I need to help your mother. Wait a second.
-Dear. -Yes?
Auntie Salmah got a loan.
But I don't know what to do with the money.
Well, I think…
I understand that Euis wanted her own room.
After all, we used to sleep in different rooms before.
But now, I'm upset
that Dad broke his promise too.
-This is Mickey Mouse? -Yes, Mickey Mouse.
-Let's eat. Here's the rice. -Where is it?
Where's the plate?
Give the plate to your mother.
I don't need any promises.
I just need Dad to fix the room.
I don't want to be promised anything anymore.
Promises are just upsetting.
And now that Agil is fussy,
Mom is tired.
So…
You can talk?
You miss your family?
Me too.
I also miss my family.
Mom, I want to go to Aril's house, okay?
Aril!
Wait a minute.
So, this chicken told you that it got lost?
Yeah.
I want to help Neon,
but I don't want to promise anything.
Who is Neon?
This is Neon.
This is Neon?
-Yes. -So, that's Neon.
They usually park there on Saturdays and Sundays.
Mister.
Have you seen the car that sells neon chickens?
It's usually there.
But I haven't seen it today.
Do you know where the chickens come from?
Of course.
Far away, from Kampung Badak.
It's called Kampung Badak,
but they have a lot of chickens.
That's very far. Grandpa and I cycled there once.
See?
Come on!
Euis, let me borrow the pencil.
Deni, ruler.
Euis, do you have the lead?
-Den. -Andi! Please focus!
Yes. You're the group leader.
Please pick someone else! What about Rindu?
Euis?
-No. -No.
Well, Deni. He's smart.
-No! -No!
Ima.
-No! -No!
What's wrong with you?
I'll treat you guys to meatballs at Mr. Aa's.
Two servings!
-No! -No!
What do you mean two "servings"? Do you have money?
You usually ask Rindu for money.
No, Andi. The teacher wants you to be the group leader.
Finish the assignment.
This?
Agil, come here.
-Come here. -No.
Just let her be.
Are you not getting enough sleep?
Agil has been really fussy the last two nights.
She's teething.
My husband is very busy too.
He has to work early in the morning.
So, I have to take care of Agil myself when she's fussy.
Should we stop selling?
No, of course not.
It's not enough.
I need to save money to replace the savings I have used.
Auntie, I'm okay.
One…
Do you have time tomorrow to meet my friend, who agreed to give us a loan?
Tomorrow,
my husband has to go to town and take the company car.
And Euis will hang out with her friends.
-But I can try. Can I bring Agil with me? -Really?
Wouldn't it be troublesome?
No, I can do it.
Well, I'll just borrow my relative's car
so you and Agil can sit comfortably, okay?
But, speaking about the loan,
I still don't know what to do with it.
This is really good!
Really?
-Yeah! Delicious! -What?
Why do you want to help the chicken to find its family?
I feel bad for it.
You're right.
The chicken must be sad to be away from his family. Right?
So your mom and dad haven't come home yet?
My father and mother said that they wanted to go home this year.
But they got laid off, so it won't be possible.
Maybe they will come home next year.
Well, Neon, you're not alone.
Aril also understands how you feel.
His mother and father work in Jakarta.
Jakarta is very far from here.
What did it say?
Nothing.
Looks like Neon's not in the mood.
If you really know the place that the guy mentioned,
why don't we just go there right away?
This stuff belongs to my grandfather.
He used to be a soldier.
We are here
and Kampung Badak…
is there.
Is it far away?
It's far.
If you want to go there,
you need an adult's help.
Ara! Stop!
Take the change. Thank you.
Mr. Romli!
Now, I can talk to the chicken.
Ara, whose chicken is that? Is the chicken clean?
Neon is clean.
Dad sprayed it with sanitizer.
Really?
Yes, it's been sprayed.
I found it when I got home from school.
Really?
The chicken said it got lost.
Did the chicken say that?
-Yes. -Amazing.
It asked me to find its family.
Mr. Romli, do you want me to help find this neon chicken's family?
Looking for its family? Oh, no.
Well, I want to do it, but…
not now. It's getting dark.
Of course not. We can't do it now.
Ara, is your father home?
I want to borrow the motorbike.
I was at Aril's house
and Dad went to the town this morning.
Really? Can I see the "naon" chicken?
-Neon chicken! -Right, neon chicken.
It's cute.
I'm home.
I'm home too.
Ara!
I made fried chicken
and played a bit with the seasoning.
-Auntie Salmah said it is really good. -It's so tasty.
I ate five pieces.
I want you to try it.
If you say it's good, this will be our next business.
I don't want to eat your fried chicken.
I'm friends with this neon chicken.
It means all chickens are my friends, Mom.
I can't betray my friends.
Euis said we can't betray our friends.
Right?
If that's the case, let me try.
I can be the judge of the fried chicken. I'm a pro.
Mr. Romli, why do you want to eat my friends?
But it's not the "naon" chicken.
Neon chicken. It's neon chicken.
I'm home.
So, you don't believe me?
I believe you.
But you didn't believe that I could talk to chickens.
If that's the case, then I don't believe you.
If you want to talk to the chicken, be my guest,
but if you say you can speak chicken, I don't believe it.
But I can really talk to chickens, Dad.
I don't believe you.
Mr. Romli could talk to frogs.
He just made that up.
If you want to have a pet, I will support you,
but I don't want you to go that far.
I'm going to town tomorrow to take the car.
Maybe you can take a trip with me. You want to go?
No.
Okay, then, you should have dinner. Don't forget to take it out.
You're not coming with me?
Let's say goodbye to Ara.
-Ara, please stay home, okay? -Yeah?
I'm heading out with Auntie Salmah.
-Okay. -Air kiss time? Okay.
One, two, three.
Come on, sweetie.
-Bye. -Bye.
Let's go. Auntie Salmah.
How are you?
-We're good. Let's go. -You're good? Come on.
Let's go. Okay.
Let's get in.
Mr. Romli!
Mr. Romli!
If we need an adult's help, we only have Mr. Romli.
Only Mr. Romli believes me.
I told him already and he agreed to help.
Ara!
Ara!
Neon, what do we do now?
Mr. Romli isn't here.
What if we go there alone?
You know where it is.
And we have the map, right?
What if it rains?
Turn right.
Can I see?
Here.
This way.
No one's home?
We can do the assignment first.
My mother will come home soon.
Are you doing your school assignment?
Yes, ma'am.
Euis, help.
I need to find Ara first.
Ara!
When I came home, I didn't see her either, Mom.
-Ducks! -So many ducks!
So cute.
It's very long!
-Neon. -Neon!
Aril. Let's play.
Let's go!
I'm going first.
One, two, three. I can't.
You couldn't do it.
Look! A frog!
The cage is not here either.
It's because you don't have time to play with Ara.
She is getting weird.
Why are you taking it out on me?
It's not my fault Ara is weird.
Euis.
Ma'am, I'm going now.
Sit down.
Hey, where are you going?
You look tired.
Why are you not saying anything?
Let's just give them a ride.
Ara!
Ara!
The chicken asked for help,
so I couldn't say no.
I don't believe you can talk to chickens.
I didn't teach you to be a bad kid
who lies to her parents.
I never lie.
But you lied now.
I'm not lying.
I can really talk to chickens.
I don't believe you.
Dear!
Only Mr. Romli believes me.
Do you want me to be angry at Romli?
Why are you bringing up Mr. Romli?
Mr. Romli believes that I can talk to chickens.
Because in the past, he could talk to frogs.
See?
I have a reason to be angry with him.
You don't have to be angry with Mr. Romli,
it's my fault.
Ara,
I understand if you want to be friends with the chicken,
but don't make us worry.
What if the driver was reckless and you got into an accident?
What if the driver was bad
and you got kidnapped and trafficked?
Why did you say that? God forbid.
Come on, Ara. Now, promise us
you won't do anything like that again.
I don't want to promise anything.
What?
I don't want to be like you and Euis,
who like to break promises.
Ara, apologize to your father.
Ara is not wrong, Mom. It's true.
Whatever! If you want to promise or not, it's up to you!
Look at me!
If you do something like that again,
I will be angry. Understand?
Euis.
Are you and Deni dating?
Euis and Deni talk on the phone every night.
No.
Yes.
Just a minute, Ara. I'm talking to Euis.
She is not actually studying.
She is so busy dating that she forgot her own sister.
-No. -Yes.
Is that true, Euis?
They usually talk until dawn.
You're staying up until dawn
to talk with him instead of studying?
Sorry, Neon.
I failed you.
You want me to sleep?
-Dear. -Honey…
Drink milk.
My baby. My sweet baby.
Dear, we can't stop Euis.
Maybe it's time.
I know.
But I don't think being strict will solve the problem either.
Well, we just need to explain everything to her.
Ha! Sweetie.
If she understands, we don't need to worry.
Mom.
-Where's the baby? Give the milk. -What?
-Come on. -Drink!
What about Ara?
Shouldn't we just do what she wants?
Looking for the neon chicken's family?
It doesn't make sense.
It's better to look for two more jobs, instead of looking for a family.
I think it would be better if you paid more attention to Ara.
Here.
I'm doing that.
It's just that Agil is fussy these days.
The business is not doing good.
That's why I want to sell fried chicken.
You need to find time too.
So we can still take care of Agil.
Wouldn't it be better if you stopped for a while and let me work?
We did that in the past anyway.
We can't. If we only rely on you, we won't have any savings.
What if there's another pandemic?
You lost your job
and we had to survive with my savings.
No!
No!
No!
I don't want to go back to those days.
I want us to have savings.
It's not only my job to take care of the kids,
it's also your job.
No.
I'm still adjusting to my new job.
I still need to learn how to manage my time.
I'm adapting.
Okay, you can rest now.
If Agil wakes up in the middle of the night, I will take care of her.
It's okay, you should rest.
You have to get up early.
Drink milk.
My daughter is now a big girl.
You like someone and is dating now.
I feel like it was just yesterday…
I heard your first cry.
Please forgive your father.
Your dad and I were shocked.
You have grown up.
I just want to say,
everything you do has risks.
There are advantages and disadvantages.
So, you have to think about it carefully.
Whenever you want to talk,
I'm here for you.
I will always listen…
to whatever you want to tell me.
Mom.
Thank you, Neon.
Are you ready?
Come on. Let's go to school!
Dad.
Can I bring Neon to school?
Neon will go home with me after school.
Ara, do you want to study, or do you want to play around?
Wow, it's been a long time
since I took the kids to school by car.
Air kiss time!
Ara, you don't want to give an air kiss?
Let Agil do it first. Air kiss!
Our turn!
-Bye! -Bye!
Bye, Euis and Ara! Bye, Dad!
CAHAYA CISARUA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Ara.
Please go straight home after school.
-Here. -Thank you.
-What do you want? -Come on. What color do you want?
-The yellow one. -Yellow?
-I want this one. -Okay, please wait. Let me get it.
This is yours. Here is your change.
-The change. -I want one!
-What color do you want? -I want one!
-You? Red? Okay. -Red!
-I want the blue one. -You can take this.
Wait a minute. One by one.
-This one. -For you. Take good care of it, okay?
I asked Grandpa about Kampung Badak.
We won't get lost again.
It's no use.
My father will be angry.
No one believes me.
I believe you.
Come on!
The bike went into the river.
Splash!
And we made it through safely.
Neon.
Do you want to hear my new song?
Neon?
Are you sad?
Don't be sad?
If I still have the energy,
we can go right away. I'll take you there.
The problem is…
This is the problem.
The problem is my back pain.
But do you believe it?
Of course, I believe it.
Back in the jungle, during the guerrilla era,
I talked to anything and everything.
I even talked to trees.
If you want to find the chicken's family, you must do it immediately.
They only have ten days to live.
Only ten days?
Just a moment, Ki.
Take care.
How can they act like lovebirds when they are only little kids?
Right?
What's the matter?
Ara?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Neon.
So, you're going to die soon?
Aril said you're going to die.
Just sit here.
Let me do the sewing, okay?
Dear, is Ara still sulking?
Please find time for Ara.
You promised to fix the room.
I know, but I haven't found the right time.
A lot of chickens at the farm died from stress.
So, now, I have to find new chickens. It means more work.
Shouldn't we help Ara
to look for the chicken's family?
I said I don't believe it.
It doesn't make sense at all.
Mom!
Not everything has to make sense.
She's just a child.
If you're about to die,
just sleep here.
I bought two of them,
but both are dead.
Mine also died.
It hasn't even been a week yet.
Why did yours die?
My father forgot to feed it.
-Thank you, Mr. Ujang. -Oh, right.
Romli.
What's going on with Ara?
What's wrong with Ara?
She said she could talk to chickens.
What is wrong with that?
Why did you say you could talk to frogs?
She believes it.
Now, she's acting really weird.
Well, when I was little, I could talk to frogs.
Now, I'm learning to talk to chickens so I can be like Ara.
-I can also talk to chickens. -See?
Mr. Ujang can also talk to chickens, right?
Mr. Ujang, we are serious now. It's not a joke.
I'm not joking either, mister.
I'm not lying. Why should I lie?
-Lying is a sin. -It's a sin!
Do you want to talk to the chickens?
Come on. I'll teach you. Here.
-Try it. -Come on.
Just try.
He wants to talk to you.
Go ahead.
What is this? What should I say?
Just say anything.
-I have to talk to the chicken? -Yes!
That one showed up.
Come on.
Chicken,
is the new food delicious?
This is so weird!
-I have a lot of work. Sorry. -Mister!
Look!
-You have to believe it! -Yes!
You have to be sure and believe it!
-Look! -Come on!
Hurry.
You're not worried your dad will be angry?
Neon,
I promise I will find your family.
I'm not lying.
I will do anything as long as you get to meet your family.

Hey, where's Deni?
I don't know. He's gone.
Where is Deni, Andi?
You guys are playing secret.
-It's not fair. -Euis!
Do you want to go home together?
So cute!
Can we do that?
Yes.
Come on.
Just hop on.
Ready?
Ready.
-Take care! -Be careful!
Take care!
Give me some.
Sit down.
Just a minute. I need to check something.
Please hurry with the fried ice cream, okay?
Sir!
Ma'am, want to buy some flour?
No.
Have you seen Ara?
She was here with Aril,
but it looked like they're in a hurry.
Ara is not home.
Where could they be?
I know.
Ara must be looking for the chicken's family again.
To Kampung Badak?
It's a village with lots of chickens.
No wonder they asked me about the village.
Hey!
-Sir. -Hey.
I want to sell a goat.
How much?
-It's cheap. -How much?
Right, please eat a lot.
Tell your friends.
Eat a lot so you don't get stressed.
Finding new chickens is difficult, especially the good ones.
Please help with my work.
If you're all healthy, it would help my work,
so I can be with my family.
Yeah?
Does anyone know Neon chicken?
Anybody else?
My daughter Ara found a chicken on the street
and this chicken asked her help
to find its family.
Hopefully, they can find it.
Hello?
Just ask around.
It's Kampung Badak.
Romli, the brake! We almost fell!
-Please call me if you have any news. -Ma'am!
Where did she go?
Let's go to the police!
It has happened before.
-We shouldn't panic. Don't panic! -Auntie.
Don't panic! We're not sure.
Don't call the police.
I think Ara is looking for the chicken's family.
What are you talking about?
Ara is looking for the chicken's family again.
What do you mean by looking for a chicken's family?
By family, she means family. It's just a normal family!
It means that there is a father, there is a mother,
there is a brother…
I know, but it's a chicken.
-Still, it's a family! -Nuts!
-Ma'am, come on! -Just a minute.
Don't panic. Maybe we can help.
Shall we look for them?
-Let's go. -I'll stay at home and take care of Agil.
Okay. Come on, Auntie!
-Come on. -Let's go!
Ma'am.
Ara is funny.
When your family just moved here, she looked happy.
No.
She's not funny anymore.
She's now troublesome.
No.
She's still funny.
That's what I think.
Maybe she looks up to you.
With you not being able to walk her home
and asking to separate your rooms,
it all made her sad.
Maybe she also wants to show you
and your family that she's not a kid anymore.
She can be responsible.
But not with her talking to chickens
and looking for the family.
Well, I can understand why she does that.
Maybe she just wants to be a good friend.
That's why she is willing to do all of that.
I don't think we passed this road last time.
Yes, but this way should be faster.
Okay, then, just be careful.
I don't think it's working.
You must have used an ancient map and we got lost.
Watch your mouth. I'm up to date. See for yourself. Here!
We missed the right turn. It was the previous turn!
You recklessly picked the turn!
Who told me to go this way?
-You! -Auntie! Why are you blaming me?
Look, ducks.
We have to get there before dark.
The road is blocked for now. Just go back.
Sir, can you open the roadblock?
I can't. It's locked.
Thank you.
-We need to turn back. -Yes.
So troublesome.
-You know it's a narrow road. -Auntie!
We need to pull the motorbike!
We have to pull it!
You know very well that I'm a classy lady! You can't ask me to pull it!
Auntie, please help.
No!
Auntie!
So annoying!
Slowly, Auntie. You're going to make me fall.
Are you not afraid to meet my father?
What?
I didn't hear you. Please speak louder.
Are you not afraid to meet my father?
No.
Why do I need to be afraid? There's nothing wrong.
VILLAGE BORDER
CV. UNGGAS MANDIRI - CHICKEN FARM
Neon, where do we go from here?
What did it say?
Neon is tired.
Tired?
But it didn't do anything.
Where are we going now?
Which way?
Ara!
Ara.
This is far, Ara.
Dad, don't be angry with Aril.
This is what I want.
Ara!
Euis, what are you doing here?
Mom asked me to do it, to find her missing child.
She's not missing. She's here.
What are you doing here? This is too far!
Stop it.
Ara.
I apologize for not believing you.
I understand that you mean well.
So you promised Neon?
I did.
I made a promise, so I have to keep it.
Yes, let's try to ask Neon. Where do we go from here?
It's almost dark. Let me get you there.
Neon, Dad wants to know where do we go from here?
Come on. Tell me so we can get there before dark.
That way. Neon said we should go there.
-The neon chicken said that? -Yes.
Wow, that's great. Ara can talk to chickens.
Ara, is this the right way? Ask Neon.
Neon, is this the right way?
This is the right way, Dad.
-Are you sure? -I am.
It's true that we need an adult's help.
Right.
-This is the coffee. -Coffee?
Hey, do you want coffee?
-Do you want it? -You want coffee?
Hey, who is that?
So many people.
Right. That's a whole group.
Neon, is this your family?
Do you need help, sir?
-Hello. Good afternoon. -Yes?
What?
Right.
It's Jono's friend, honey. The red one.
But this is really the family, right?
-Yes. It's the right family. Thank you. -Yes.
-Yes. You're very cute. -Romli!
What are you doing?
Everyone's here!
I told you. Don't trust your map!
-Back then, this area… -It was a forest.
-That was a rice field before. -I see…
Thank God we…
Good evening, mister.
Come in.
-What is this? -A little something from my mother.
Tell your mother I said thank you.
Come in.
I'm sorry I disappointed you.
I couldn't keep the promise to always come home from school together.
It's okay.
The promise was in the past anyway.
Now, I understand why you are busy.
I'm sorry for making you upset too.
Here's the thing. Let's not make empty promises.
If we have time to go home together, let's just do it.
I think that's a good idea!
Dad promised to fix my room.
But I don't know when.
You don't have to wait for him.
You have me. Let's do it together.
-Let's do it! -Yeah!
But before we do that,
I have a present that can sleep with you.
A present?
Open it.
We might not sleep in the same room anymore,
but I can still be with you.
Thank you, Euis.
It's okay if you want to sleep in my room once in a while.
But please knock on the door.
Roger that!
Do you want to listen to my song?
Come on.
Show me.
Euis, Ara, everyone's waiting downstairs.
Let's have dinner.
They've been waiting for you two.
Euis gave me a lamp.
-A lamp? -Yeah!
So we need to take pictures of the opak and fried chicken,
then we sell them online.
It's late. Enough talking about business.
Let's enjoy this. Goat curry!
But we need to proceed with the business.
I don't want to be a loan woman forever.
Sure.
Mister, only rice? Where's the curry?
You want to enjoy it first?
Okay, let Romli be the first to try.
I'm okay if you guys want to eat chicken.
-Dear, Ara's willing to eat chicken. -Yes?
I won't eat them, but it's okay if the others want to.
Have some curry. Here.
Ara, please eat a lot.
You eat a lot, right?
I can start with a little bit.
Dad.
Yes?
It looks like
I can talk to goats now.
Ara, please not now. The goat…
The goat is already in my mouth.
Ara, so, can we eat the curry or not?
You can.
-I thought it was the same. -Gosh.
Aril, here.
-You can have more later. -Eat this.
Ara, please eat a lot. What do you want?
Mom, Agil, hurry up.
Let's go.
Agil!
Ara, it looks weird now.
What are you doing?
Euis even joined in.
Watch out!
Look!
Come on. Put your hand in there.
-Come here. Put it on the wall. -Put it on the wall.
Your mother should do it too!
That's Ara.
Mr. Hasan is taking so long.
He's not here yet.
I'm thirsty.
Have some coffee while it's hot. Have some coffee, sir. Please.
-We've been waiting for this. -Slowly.
-Thank you. -Enjoy the coffee.
-I want a glass too. -Sure, here's yours, Mr. Yaumil.
-Please wait, ma'am. -Thank you, Ben.
-Thank you, Ben. -You're welcome.
Have some coffee while it's hot.
Please, have some.
Enjoy it while it's hot.
Have some coffee, sir.
-Okay. -So refreshing.
That's Mr. Hasan.
-Hopefully, we hear some good news. -I hope so.
-Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too.
So what's the news, sir?
I have both good and bad news.
The good news is
that the company has agreed to meet our representatives
to discuss and renegotiate the demands.
Praise be to God.
And they'll come up with better offers for us.
Negotiation?
Then what are we doing now?
I think it's better for us to go home and rest.
I don't think that's a good idea.
If we remove the blockade, we're giving them opportunity.
That's right, sir!
Calm down, we have to keep thinking positively.
Calm down, everyone.
Just go home and get some rest.
And we can prepare a better argument for the negotiation.
-Okay? -What's the bad news?
The bad news…
SUSTAINABLE EARTH, NO DEFORESTATION
Move away!
Ouch!
Move!
Sir!
-Retreat! -Retreat!
-Run, you fools! -Run!
They have crossed the line!
What negotiation? This is oppression!
Now, anyone who can go home, please do so.
The ladies and I can provide some help if anyone needs medical treatment.
I'll go find a vehicle for us.
Please. Thank you.
We will need it to carry the injured to the community health clinic.
Take care, Ben.
-Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too.
Hi, coffee boy!
What happened to your face? Did you get into a fight?
I was beaten up by some thugs.
You and your shenanigans…
Go treat your wounds.
It's okay, they're just some minor scratches.
I'm a guy, after all.
What is it?
Well, you have to see this.
Filosofi Diskopi is ready! See?
Ga, turn off the lights!
Cool!
-We'll go ahead with the disco vibe, huh? -Say hi, Aga!
-Beni! -Aga is there?
Hello, Ben!
What happened to him?
It's nothing, just some scratches.
Chill.
Ben, in two days,
we'll launch Filosofi Diskopi.
I'll buy you a ticket, and you have to be here!
I don't think I can join you guys. I've got some problems here.
What are you doing there?
You have to come! Period!
Fine, fine!
You talk too much.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE FOUNDER OF FILOSOFI DISKOPI
-Where's he? -I don't know.
So what about it?
Jody.
Hi!
We didn't find Ben.
What do you mean?
We looked for him all over the airport.
We even asked the staff there, but we didn't find him.
They don't know of any passenger named Beni Susilo.
We couldn't contact his number.
I tried to call him before.
The number you're calling can't be reached.
Please try again in a few minutes.
Where on earth is this guy?
The number you're calling can't be reached.
-See? -Please try again in a few minutes.
Rather than staying here and being worried all by yourself,
why don't you go to Ben's hometown?
The coffee shop?
The boys and I can handle it.
Jod. Ben only has you.
WE ARE READY TO SERVE THE PEOPLE POLICE SERVICE CENTER
Who are you?
Calm down. Don't be scared.
I'm Hasan.
I know who you're looking for.
I'm a friend of Ben's father.
Ben is like my own son.
I've been looking for him as well, but I haven't found anything.
I just reported it to the police.
Any result?
They just said I'm not a direct family member.
So it's no good, right?
We had a clash with company security forces.
A few of the protesters got hurt, so Ben and I took care of them.
Then, Ben left to find some vehicles for us.
We haven't heard anything from him since.
I found his phone.
This is the jungle.
We're all alone here, so watch your back.
Call me if you need anything.
Sir!
-It's in. Thank you. -Okay.
You're welcome.
Miss, do you have a charger for this type of phone?
I have one.
This dimwit…
Mr. Hasan? Can I see you?
Okay, we can meet tonight.
Okay, see you.
Thank you, miss.
-Sir, here's your drink. -Thank you.
Hi. Sorry…
Ma'am. The usual.
Here.
-Here's the money. -Thank you.
Come on.
Thank you, ma'am.
Get out!
Wait a sec…
Wait.
Come on!
Wait a moment.
-Who are you looking for? -Can you put the gun down?
Do you want money?
I can give you money if you want.
You fucktard!
Kneel! Do it!
I'm looking for my friend.
-Here, I have a… -What?
Wait a sec…
This is him.
See?
Where's my friend?
You fucker!
Come on! Quick!
What…?
Open it!
Get in!
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
You fucker…
I thought you were dead. Beni…
Fuck you, Ben.
What are you doing here?
Fuck!
You went missing and I came here for you. You shithead!
Wake up, bro!
If Tubir finds you lazing around, we're dead!
-Let's go get a coffee! -How did you get here?
-Someone gave me your phone… -Don't stay up late!
If you get sick, it'll give me trouble.
That shithead…
A man named Hasan.
Is he okay?
-He's okay. -Thank God.
Who are these people?
They're the elders of the native villages around here.
Some of them are members of farming village communities.
They fought back after the company tried to seize their land.
They're just like me.
We fought back,
so we are held hostage to scare people.
So the villagers will change their minds and agree to be relocated.
Then the company can take their land.
Well…
You better sleep.
Take a rest.
Sure.
-Hurry up, slowpoke! -What is it?
Come on!
City boys… What are you glaring at?
-Huh? -Watch your step!
What now?
-Come on! -Quick!
Come on!
Come on! Hurry up!
Quick!
Hurry up!
Hey!
Come on!
Come on, city boys!
-Hey! -Watch your eyes!
Hurry up!
Fuck…
Come here!
Here! Have some more!
All that muscle, and still carrying them one by one!
Jod, take this…
Don't let them see you being idle. They'll come after you.
-Where should I carry this? -Follow me.
Come on!
Come on! Put that down!
Go back there! Quick!
Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Hey, come here!
What is this symbol?
Eyes, nose… Where is the mouth?
How dare you!
Who's that?
That's the boss.
They call him Tubir.
Tubir?
How do you spell "Ribut" (Noisy) backward?
Tem!
What is it?
Who's that?
Is he a good worker?
You don't know him?
You're so sluggish. Come on!
My leg…
Ben, look over there!
Hey!
Jod! Hey, Jod!
-Fuck you! -Stop!
You're new here? You think you're a hero, huh?
Who are you exactly?
I told you, I came here
to find my friend, Ben, that long-haired guy, mas.
Don't "mas" me!
You think everyone is Javanese, so you can call me "mas"?
Don't you ever "mas" me!
Excuse me.
-This is the water. -Put it over there.
But…
we're not dangerous.
What do you mean "not dangerous"?
Your friend organized a protest!
-He's just being a Mr. Know-It-All. -You are a Mr. Know-It-All!
But he's worse than me
because, in fact, he doesn't know anything.
By the way…
-This is for you. -What is it?
I can give you money too.
But please let us go.
You think money is the answer to everything?
I'm Tubir…
I have my own integrity.
Integrity!
-Cek! -Right here!
Where's my coffee?
What is this?
Is this coffee or sweet stew? You put in too much sugar.
Do it right!
Look! Someone's trying to run away!
Get up!
What is it?
You see what happens if you try me?
If you try to escape?
Got it?
Get in!
Those bastards…
Lie down here.
You shithead!
Shithead!
Stay where you are!
-What? -You shithead!
See?
Don't you dare try to escape!
-Take a look at him. -Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Are you all right?
What did he do to you?
Give me your hand.
We can't let them keep persecuting us like this.
-We have to find a way to fight back. -You're right.
You're right.
Don't let it get to you.
Just eat.
Have you checked over there?
Just eat. What's wrong?
You smart-ass!
What is it?
No wonder he got caught. He didn't plan the escape well.
I have an idea.
What idea?
I don't know how to do it.
But…
That Tubir guy…
He gets mad whenever his boys make him coffee.
Why are you grinning?
You too!
That's it!
What do you do?
You're a barista.
If you can make him like your coffee,
at least you'll be able to walk around this place.
Then we can think about the next strategy.
I see…
That's a good idea.
Time's up!
-Work! -Get up! Time to work!
Wait a sec…
-Wait a sec… -What are you looking at?
Do you think you're Godam? Move your ass and work!
You're not a superhero! Work!
Get up! Stop glaring at me!
-Work! -Let me finish this.
Come on!
-Left? -Like this?
A little bit to the right.
Right!
That's left. I said right!
Up! Just a little bit!
Up! Just a little bit!
-Hey! -There.
The antenna! Cek!
-Yeah? -My coffee!
Can't you do it right?
Your coffee tastes like shit!
Calm down!
-Turn around! -I just want to…
I just want to offer some coffee to Aa Tubir.
-Bullshit! -I can make good coffee. You'll love it.
He talks too much!
-What…? -Shut up!
Aa Tubir…
I'm a barista.
I make coffee every day.
It would be a lie to say my coffee doesn't taste good.
What if it really doesn't?
Then you can just shoot him in the head.
Really?
Tem.
It's done.
Let's go.
Sit down.
You made this?
I did.
It's really good.
Cek! This is real coffee! I can drink it.
Not that sweet stew you always make!
Got it!
Excuse me. sir.
Can I give some to my friends?
Sure, go ahead.
But not too much, since it's so good.
I'll make some more for you next time.
Awesome!
Perfect!
Nice!
Excuse me, Aa.
This is how you make coffee.
Coffee you can drink.
Stupid!
Gentlemen, I have some coffee.
We can share it.
Please…
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
This smells so good.
This is really good.
Take a sip.
Please enjoy.
Thank you, Ben.
Thank you, sir.
Fuck you!
You made my head a bet for Tubir.
But the plan went well, right?
My goodness…
Next…
We can…
Are you planning something?
I can help if you want.
What are you doing? Go and guard the place!
Come here.
Here.
There are two routes leading outside the forest.
The main route is the road they opened.
But choosing this route to get to the main road will be too risky.
I can show you a shortcut instead.
But it's a little complicated.
Their guard is down every time they watch a badminton game.
Gele and Encek fall asleep every time they're on night watch.
Well, these two factors will give you an opportunity to escape.
This route I drew goes all way down.
If you two move fast enough,
you'll be safe from them in ten minutes.
-Got it? -Yes.
Then how can we escape this place?
Ben!
Jody!
How…?
-Nobody's home. -I checked the back and found no one.
Where are they?
I told you that tomorrow is the final, and all I see on the TV is noise!
Stupid!
Can't you do your job properly?
Encek! Watch them!
You know that tomorrow is the game for the children of our nation.
You want them to win, right?
Stupid!
Stupid!
Tomorrow is the final.
Indonesia versus China.
Good!
They'll focus on the game.
You're ready?
So, are we going to escape in a small group?
No.
This is only for you two.
-But… -No, we're old.
We'll only slow you down.
You're young.
You have hope.
The future of this land is in your hands.
Take this chance.
We went to the police.
-But we haven't found any clues. -I see.
It's useless to report it.
But we have tried our own way to keep looking for them.
If there's any news, I'll update you as soon as possible.
We will wait for your good news.
Sure.
As soon as possible.
Get him!
-Watch out! -Get him!
Come on!
-Smash! -That's right!
Come on!
Go!
Come on!
Encek! You dimwit!
You stupid fuck!
-He's just playing around. -You too!
Encek! Go call the coffee guy!
I need to enjoy something good to relax.
What are you looking at?
What do we do now?
What do we do, sir?
Where's the coffee guy?
Yeah!
Move!
They escaped!
Get them!
Wait! Get them!
Come on, Cek!
Get them!
Hurry up!
Come on, Jody!
Shit!
Jod! Jody, come on.
Where are those jerks?
Hey! Ben!
Take this.
What do I do with this? Fuck!
Hurry!
-Where are they? -Over here.
Shit!
Hey! Don't run!
Watch out, Jody!
Fuck!
Hey, chase them!
You do that!
I'm going to look after him. They have a gun.
Jod! Jod, come here!
Cek, help me.
Okay.
Ben, right or left?
Left.
Keep walking!
Fuck…
Jody!
Jody…
Watch out! Hold on to me.
Watch out. Just hold on…
We can shelter there.
Watch out…
Hang on…
We can take shelter here.
-Let me sit here. -No, wait.
Slowly. Come here.
Ouch…
Ben, are you feeling cold?
It's so cold here.
Get closer to the fire.
Come here, get closer to the fire.
Come here. It's warm, right?
Have some rest.
I killed someone…
Ben, I killed someone.
Ben…
Beni…
Ben, please help me.
-Ben. Beni… -Shut up.
Shut up! Shut up, Jod!
Shut up!
Just sleep. Come here.
I'm so tired.
I'm tired.
Jod.
Jod, wake up! Don't fall asleep!
-I'll go find water for you. -Ben…
It's a river, Jod! We made it!
Jody, we made it!
I found the river! Jody!
Jod!
Jody, I found the river!
Wake up! We can get there in five minutes!
We just need to walk a little more.
Put that down.
We're not bad guys.
-Put that down! -We're not bad guys!
Come on!
-Come on, Jago! -Come on.
This is our village. Come on!
Jago, take him to Mak Lis' house.
Okay.
Take him in. The wound needs to get treated.
Okay.
Where were you held hostage?
Where did you get this?
Mak! Mak Lis!
Mak Lis asked me to give this to you. Please drink it.
Just drink it. It's not poisonous.
Thank God, he got help just in time.
If he'd come even a minute later,
he could have been killed by the infection.
Hopefully, by the day after tomorrow, he will be getting better.
Excuse me, Mak Lis.
You. Follow me to the main house.
Can I join them?
Go ahead.
Who are you exactly?
-Did the company send you? -Are you spying on us?
He must be a bad person! For sure!
I told you I'm Ben, I'm a barista. Jody is my bro.
Then why do you have a gun and why is your friend hurt?
Answer me!
I live in the district.
I run a coffee cultivation business.
I've been protesting with produce farmers
because the company planned to take their lands.
Then, one day, the protest turned into a riot.
That night, I was kidnapped.
My friend came here looking for me, and he got kidnapped too.
We were held hostage by illegal loggers with 15 other men.
-We were asked to work and open a route… -How did you manage to escape?
Why only you two? Where are the others?
-Answer me! -Bora!
-Let him finish. -He could be lying to us.
-He must be lying… -Right!
-Tambora! -He's lying!
Come on.
Where's the map?
I know I'm younger than you,
but don't you ever yell at me in front of so many people!
As long as Father isn't home, I'm the guardian of this village.
It's my responsibility.
We haven't heard anything from Father for six months.
I just hope you can lead us the way he did!
He always listened to others.
I just want to say that something is off.
If they were really heading for town,
they shouldn't have crossed the river.
It's either they were fooled
or we are being fooled.
Be honest!
Where did you come from?
I am being honest.
I was just told I had to find the river
to find the main road heading into town.
Mr. Hamid said that!
Mr. Hamid?
Mr. Hamid is the one who gave me the map.
Does he have a scar on his neck?
Father is still alive.
Father is still alive, Tambora.
Father is still alive.
Father…
It was Father who sent Ben and Jody here to tell us that he's still alive.
-Father is still alive. -Father is still alive?
Bring it there.
Jani…
Father is still alive, Jago.
Father is still alive…
Maybe the others are still alive too.
Father is still alive…
You're really something.
You woke up faster than I expected.
Where are we?
We're in Mr. Hamid's village.
They saved us.
I'm Rinjani, Mr. Hamid's first child.
I'm Mak Lis.
I'm the mother of all the children in this village.
I'm Musang.
The cutest kid here.
We made it.
Most of them are farmers.
They've been guarding this village for generations.
Do they go to school?
Those who can afford it go to school, like me.
In the district.
I graduated from high school in the district two years ago.
But for the past few years,
they have been pushing us to move from here.
You mean relocated?
Oh, right. I'm Tambora.
I'm Rinjani's younger sister.
I'm Jody.
We need to find out from you where the captive camp is.
What are you up to?
We want to help our parents escape.
-What else? -Tambora…
It would be better to report it to the police in the city.
So you won't show us the way?
They are well armed there.
We only have a gun with one bullet left.
Do you want to die for nothing?
We can't put our hope in others.
This is the jungle.
Our fate is in our own hands.
Our barn is burning.
Jani!
They went that way!
Bora!
Jani!
There's barely anything left in the barn.
Come on!
You see it now?
The police, you said?
Come on!
What on earth is happening now?
If we go back to the camp, we're only looking for death.
You almost died right in front of me.
I know.
But…
But what?
You came here to find me.
And I'm here with you now.
Alive and well.
We made it.
What do you want now?
I'm grateful for that, Ben.
If not for them, I might be going back to Jakarta as a dead body.
I owe them my life.
What if we just ask them to give us directions?
If we get lost,
we'll take days to find the camp.
We'll waste our time and energy.
What if they refuse?
We can't force them, right?
They saw how my arrow cut through that intruder's body.
You mean we'll threaten them?
You said it yourself.
You're the leader of this village in the absence of our father.
Father said that merely fighting back is not what matters the most.
What matters is how we fight back.
If we threaten Ben and Jody,
how are we different from that evil company?
Good morning.
Excuse me.
I came here to apologize.
I…
I can't…
I haven't had the chance to say thank you
for saving my life.
And I came here
to apologize
because I can't guide you back to the camp.
It's okay.
I understand.
You owe us nothing, Jody.
You can go home.
You deserve to go back to your life.
Jod!
Let's go!
Before it gets late!
Now I understand why you left our shop twice.
What?
You went back to your hometown.
And you live with what you have here.
What are you talking about?
I've been living with so many calculations.
It was all about the math. The numbers.
I forgot that there are more things I can do with my life
than think about numbers.
Are you drunk?
I will go back to the camp.
I'll help Rinjani save the elders of this village.
Are you high? Or drunk?
I can't go back to Jakarta.
-This is not an action movie. -I can't act like nothing happened here.
You think we're Rambo?
That you're Chuck Norris?
Before you act all high and mighty,
remember that I organized a protest to fight that company.
What did I get?
I was kidnapped and beaten up.
And you were there.
We almost died.
We almost lost our lives.
I can't remember how many bullets almost went through our heads.
We work with coffee.
Our job is to make coffee.
We should go back now.
The person killed by Rinjani's arrow got me thinking…
about why I had to kill someone.
Our duty is to survive.
This land is their life.
Their families in the camp are also their lives.
Just imagine…
if Mr. Hamid was my dad…
or your father.
What would we do?
If we choose to go from the south, it's all the way up.
So we need to make a detour so we can get to this height.
And we will pass two intersections.
Right, Ben?
The first intersection is a former road for vehicles.
The second intersection has two overlapping big rocks.
I know that place.
We can go through the Pohon Jangkung forest
and come out north of the foothills.
That's the place where we worked?
-Right? -Yes, right.
This is the logging area.
You have helped us with that information, Musang.
But you need to guard the village. Don't come with us.
No, I will come with you. I can help you all.
It's too dangerous.
Mak Lis needs you.
If we go tomorrow morning,
we can get there at midnight to spy on them.
Thank you for joining us.
I will come with you!
Just go ahead.
I can help.
Musang, if you come with us, who will guard the village?
-You're more needed there. -I can attack from afar.
-Musang, trust me. -I have to go with you.
Your help is needed in our village.
Musang, listen to Bora.
-This is the rock Musang mentioned. -Yes.
Jody and I came from there.
So that way is north.
Looks like there's a guard post there. We'll monitor their movements.
Jod, I'm going with them.
Hey, Beni!
Ben! Wait!
-Who's that? -Fuck!
That stupid guy!
Try to check over there!
Beni, you fucker.
Who's there?
Musang!
-Jago! -Musang?
I told you to guard the village!
Why didn't you listen?
If I'd been late by even a second,
Jago would've got shot and they would've heard the gunshot.
He's right.
Okay then. You can follow us sneaking around.
But do not go into the camp.
Jody, go and look around. You know the place better.
You need this?
You're like Doraemon.
The night guards are Encek and Gele.
We have a chance.
They often fall asleep on night duty.
Can I borrow that?
Can you see anything?
Shit!
What is Mr. Hasan doing here?
Let me see.
He gave you my phone.
Before you met Encek, you made an appointment with him.
-That's really Mr. Hasan. -He fooled me.
What is it?
That man is Mr. Hasan,
the person who leads the farmers' movement with Ben to protest against the company.
-Take care! -Take care!
-Go check that area! -Okay!
Encek and Gele must be asleep now.
Come.
We're so lucky tonight.
Come on, Musang.
Okay.
We'll split up.
Four that way and four this way.
Now! Be careful!
-Come on! -Which one is it, Ben?
This is the one.
You two get the cars. I'll take care of this.
-Now. -Now.
Fuck! No key!
Seriously?
-What are you doing? -Looking for wires.
Why would you do that? You've watched too many movies.
This!
Hurry up!
Come on!
Come on.
Hurry up! Get in!
-Hurry up! -Come on!
Hurry up, sir!
Ben, move!
They escaped! Hey!
What's happening?
Get down!
Get down! Down!
Get down!
What happened?
Is everything okay?
-Jody is not here! -What?
He's still in the camp!
Can anybody drive?
-Me! -Take over! Excuse me, sir.
Fuck!
This kid is acting tough!
Eat this, shithead!
Fuck!
City boy…
Can you shoot?
Pull the trigger!
Shoot me!
Shoot me.
Shoot me! Shoot!
Shoot me!
This is how you do it.
I didn't expect this…
I'm sick of fighting for nothing.
It's better to be their ally.
You shot my brother.
You two have caused so many problems!
Hasan!
Mr. Hasan!
Ben!
Ben! Ben, wake up!
Jago, the key is in the car!
Come on! We have to go!
Come on!
Come on, Jago!
-Bro… -Where are they?
-Get them! Get them, dimwit! -Hey!
Hasan!
Hasan…
Ben, hang on…
Jago, they're after us!
Stop, you fuckers!
Jago! Faster, Jago! Faster!
Hurry!
Stop, you fuckers!
Hurry! Jago, faster!
Come on!
Jerks! Stop!
Stop!
Move away!
Fuck!
Shoot them!
Get down!
Watch out!
Musang, watch out!
-Fuck! -You fuckers!
Shit!
Come on, Jago!
Ben, just a little more…
Just a little more.
-Ben. Stay awake. -Just wait a little longer, Ben!
-Beni! -It's cold.
-Ben. Stay with me. -Jago, faster!
Beni! Stay with me!
Beni! Stay with me, Ben!
-Ben! -Just a little more…
Beni! Stay with me… Fuck!
Jago!
Stay with me, Ben! Ben.
Don't think about the end of this road
Stay with me, you fucker.
-Ben, come on! -Jago!
Jago, faster!
Just a little more.
Hang on! Jago!
Don't think about the end of this road
Don't think about…
Sing with me, Ben!
Just sing, you fucker!
Don't think about the end of this road
Don't think about the end of this road
Hold on, Ben! Wait a little longer!
Don't think about the end of this road
Follow me, Ben.
-Ben… -Don't think
About the end of this road
We're free
We're free
Just a little longer, Ben.
This is a news show. Today our parliament, or Rada,
puts the anti-corruption laws for vote again.
As a reminder, this is what the IMF demands
in exchange for a 15 millions' loan.
Laws on offshore banks,
reforms of the judiciary system and prosecutor's office…
Everything looks very well now.
But we know what is going to happen in reality.
Where's the political will? Where are the promised reforms?
Why does everyone think that the loan is a remedy?
Maybe Chuiko's arrest was a mistake?
The previous government secured the stability.
We were not living in paradise but at least…
THE HAT IS TOO BIG FOR VASIA
I have a question. Who is better?
An honest dilettante or a corrupted pro…?
How is the President going to convince Rada? What new can he say?
Let's be honest. Everyone's waiting for him to resign.
FREEDOM TO YURA!
I hope now everyone realizes these laws must be adopted.
The IMF is making a decision tomorrow.
This voting is our last chance.
It's high time for us to understand the society has changed.
It is not going to wait and forgive anymore.
There won't be yet another revolution.
There will be the last one.
I hope you understood me.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Dear ladies and gentlemen, the legislative package,
suggested by the President of Ukraine, is put to the vote.
Please vote.
VOTES IN FAVOR - 1 THE DECISION HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN
Sorry, I pushed the wrong button. I am against it, too.
You shouldn't have drunk that much last night.
-Look who is talking. -Enough, gentlemen.
Stop it. We have to move on to the next question.
-We are not moving on. -I beg your pardon?
I said we are not moving on!
What's going on? Where did you all come from, Aldebaran?
What's so funny? 40% of unemployed people? Or backdated salaries?
Come on, tell me, so that all the country could laugh, too.
No populism, please. All that is not the deputies' fault.
You should bring in normal and refined laws.
-Have you even read these laws? -Yes, we have.
And we've got amendments. Again.
Then we will apply these amendments.
We will sit here until you adopt these laws.
There is a protocol. The agenda.
-Your laws only bring troubles. -Ok. Give that to me.
All right. The renaming of Ulianovka, Chapayevka and Shchorsovka.
Are you against the decommunization?
I am not. But is it our main problem?
People are starving, for God's sake!
And renaming the cities will not change that.
People are scared to be out in the street late with their kids.
And it doesn't matter whose name the street bears.
Our court is corrupted, too,
and renaming the city district won't help that, either.
Whose fault is it? Yours!
-And yours, too. Yes! I and my party… -Your party?
Stop that, ladies and gentlemen!
Your phone's ringing. Mr. President!
What?
Your phone's ringing.
Answer the phone, Vasily Petrovich.
-Hello? -Hello, Vasily Petrovich.
Maybe you should stop casting pearls before swine? Let's meet.
Did you decide to wear me down? Why are you putting him through?
-I want to help. -How?
Where should I go? Why? To meet whom?
-Hello. -Hello.
A counter-question. Did you make me your adviser
because of my competency or because we are dating?
Don't talk nonsense.
I am a good adviser, so I must speak the truth.
And the truth is that these people
are making all the decisions regarding laws.
Do you realize what you are forcing me to do?
Meeting them would mean accepting their status,
admitting that Rada is a fiction and that the country's fate
is decided by the code of criminals.
The sooner you admit it, the better!
You cannot treat pneumonia thinking you have a running nose.
Vasia, there is no other option.
You know that but you are afraid to admit it to yourself.
Okay, I will meet them.
Sorry, I've snapped.
Never mind.
The scent is wonderful.
Really? I don't feel it.
So, this is your scent. A right choice.
-Talk. -He's on his way.
Vasily Petrovich, thank you for coming.
-We meet too rarely. -I have a lot of work.
Let's not talk about work. Do you like horses?
-I bought a great stallion. -He always brings that horse up.
Sometimes you have to switch or you might go crazy.
Vasily Petrovich, our Rada won't run away.
-Your Rada. -Well, you understand it…
And if you do, let's come to an agreement.
-Let's do it. -Sure thing.
We are talking about 15 billion dollars.
You can get this money upon the following terms.
This is the candidate for the Prime Minister.
It took less than 2 months…
We needed to agree on the terms for all the parties.
Well, "milking" the IMF money
is a good motivation for striking a deal.
Come on, Vasily Petrovich. It'll be none the worse off for you.
You'll even have some money for the economy.
-Are you kidding me? -It's a lose-lose situation for you.
It's either him or nothing at all.
PASSPORT OF THOROUGHBRED HORSE
We are sick and tired of your horse, Misha.
I think he would make a good candidate for the PM.
He eats out of my hands, you know.
Here, Vasily Petrovich. I am sorry.
SERGEY LEONIDOVICH KARASIUK
This is not an option.
We don't have any other options.
-So be it. -What are you counting on?
We have all the aces.
I think you're overestimating your standing a little.
It was funny.
-Are you threatening us? -Me? God forbid.
But I will do all I can for these laws to be adopted.
We are sick of you, the reformers. It worked without you.
It wasn't too stable, but it did work.
And suddenly you came up
and changed the rules of the game in a second.
Why did you put Yura to jail?
You had to make arrangements with him,
to ask for his approval, to listen to him.
Great job, you guys.
You squeezed everything out of the country.
But you're still hungry. What are you saving for, huh?
We can chip in if you need help. All the country can.
Have you ever thought what would be written on your graves
when you kick the bucket?
-Nothing. -There will be no deal, then.
I guess you are right.
Which was to be proved. This meeting was useless.
Ok, he won't be the Prime Minister.
But can he be the President?
Why not?
Let's go.
Someone ran away, someone drank Someone was not born at all
If you don't wanna become a living corpse Come to the concert of your favorite band
Together we'll sing and dream of a country That will never become a paradise
Banderlogs are at every step - beware! They'll grab your legs - watch out!
There are many of them And you are alone…
To hell with you, Tolik.
The Prince is going to speak!
Brethren! We shall not disgrace our land.
We shall fall in battle, as the dead bear no shame.
Yes, you can leave and hide in your homes
with your wives and your herds.
You will plough, saw, and rejoice at the mercy of the khan
who wouldn't ruin your homes.
Will those who sold their comrades like mute beasts
be consumed by remorse?
I am coming after you!
I'll conspire with anyone, be it a god or an evil spirit,
to beat the Khazars' army.
But if there is anyone who decides to betray me…
The car started, Vasily Petrovich!
We can go now.
I will conspire with anyone to beat the Khazars…
Oh, hello there, Vasily Petrovich.
I've been expecting you yesterday.
Did you just come to visit or, as they say here, to be a resident?
Come in, sit down. Make yourself at home.
-How've you been? -Like in prison.
The lack of fresh air, vitamins and the sun.
The food's awful.
I will ask them to improve your living conditions.
Thank you, chief.
Vasily Petrovich, it's not why you are here, right?
I assume Rada didn't vote in favor
and you couldn't come to terms with our mutual friends.
So you decided to offer me a deal.
What can you do? Make my term less than 20 years?
-I can make it 7 years at the most. -Well, it sounds so tempting.
But I think I will refuse.
You should've accepted our friends' offer, though.
They want to have a full control of the IMF money
through their Prime Minister.
Well, the offer is great.
But I have not yet agreed to be the Prime Minister.
It has nothing to do with you.
They want Karasiuk.
-Who? -Karasiuk.
-Sergey…? -Leonidovich.
I want to know everything about them.
If you give me the compromising material on them,
you will be free. In 7 years.
Are you thirsty?
Let's go.
So, they chose Karasiuk, huh? Very interesting.
Come on.
Vasily Petrovich!
Yes, I agree, the whisky is quite lousy.
12-year-old crap.
Here you go. As they say, you're welcome to all I have.
You can have chocolate or fruit.
I must make a call, if you don't mind.
Hello, Boria! What's that joke about Karasiuk?
Oh, so it's not a joke, huh?
Everyone has decided on it?
Is the decision final? I see.
You know, Vasily Petrovich, I think I will accept your offer.
But on different terms.
First, I want a total amnesty.
Let's make it a half, ok?
Do you want the whole loan or a half of it?
Second, you must unfreeze all my accounts.
It's going to be very difficult.
Do you think it will be easy for me?
Can you imagine what would happen to me
if they suspected I decided to strike a deal with you?
Then I could only dream of my death to be quick.
Do you really know how to do it?
For that, I need to know two things.
How much time do we have?
And who has picked this perfume for you?
-Mika! -Yes, Vaso?
Tomorrow morning you must go to the remand prison
to pick up Yurii Ivanovich.
Bring him to your place. He has agreed to give testimony.
Got you, bro. I'll do it.
Have you visited Yurii Ivanovich?
He'll turn the oligarchs in for the amnesty.
Are you really going to release him?
Releasing one man will help me put all of them to jail.
Everything will be fine.
Take care.
A great man has passed away.
A wonderful family man…
A well-qualified manager and an experienced politician.
It's absolutely obvious
that he suffered namely for his political activity
and principled views.
Yura was never afraid…
I can't hear anything.
-Many people didn't like it. -Don't lean out.
They will notice you. What are we doing here?
Not everyone is lucky to see their own funeral.
First this preposterous, fabricated case…
And when it became clear that the lawsuit would be lost,
the government decided to get rid of him
in such a cruel way.
-Who is that? -Who?
-The man who's crying. -Oh, it's Gena.
-A friend of yours? -A real jerk.
-Why is he crying then? -These are happy tears.
You can't imagine how much he owes me.
What else can I say?
My congratulations!
The 90s are back in Ukraine. If someone thinks…
I wonder who sent this small and pathetic funeral wreath?
Why small? It's an ordinary wreath.
Vasily Petrovich, did you send me a wreath?
-Yes. -This is so cynical!
Excuse me. Sergey, hello.
Hello, Vasia. Are you already in Lviv?
I can't really talk right now.
Are you nuts?
Do you think I can embarrass myself in front of the IMF?
When will you be there?
I don't know, but certainly not today. Make something up.
I understand. Reschedule the meeting or…
-Vasily Petrovich! -What? Yurii Ivanovich, I'm talking.
Sergey, you're a minister so find a way.
All right, bye.
Damn it. He didn't even fly here yet.
-Speak Ukrainian, please. -I prefer throwing fits in Russian!
I don't care. You promised me. You must speak only Ukrainian to learn it.
All right. So, Vasily Petrovich is still in Kyiv.
It's ok. We can distract Mr. Adelweinsteiner for a few hours
by giving a tour around the Potoskys' palace.
A few hours, Oksana? He is not going to be here today!
-We are screwed. -That's what you can tell Mr…
-Adelweinsteiner. -Adel… wen…
-Adelweinsteiner. -Adels…
-Adel… -Adel.
-Wein… -Wein.
-Steiner. -Steiner!
-And now all of it. Otto Adelweinsteiner. -Otto…
-I'll call him by name. -He wouldn't like that.
Then you will say his last name.
Well, how do you think it will look like?
Memorize it while you have time.
It's too late, Oksana. Do you hear me? Too late.
And don't even try to joke with him. He is very serious and principled.
For him, schedule and protocol matter the most.
-Is he as boring as you are? -Jerk.
-Welcome to Ukraine. -Thank you. Do you speak English?
Yes, a little bit. But I prefer speaking Ukrainian.
-Mister Mukhin… -It's ok.
We can speak Ukrainian.
Don't be surprised. My Grandma was from Ukraine.
-Oh. Then welcome to Ukraine, Mr. Otto… -Adelweinsteiner!
-Yes. -Thank you.
Let's go.
Excuse me, but where is the President?
-He didn't come. -Does it mean we have problems?
No. What made you think so?
Did the President empower you to discuss all the matters?
-No. -Then we have problems.
-We have no problems, Mr. Otto… Say it! -Adelweinsteiner.
Is the President absent because the laws weren't adopted?
Oh, there were more laws adopted than should've been.
Now they're trying to figure out which of these laws were really necessary.
The final consultations are taking place and the details are being clarified.
Mr. President is about to fly here.
I'd like to remind you
that our meeting was scheduled for yesterday,
and only because of the recent tragedy we agreed to have it rescheduled.
Do you understand?
We really appreciate what you are doing for us.
Mr. Otto…
-Adelweinsteiner. -Yes.
Is it Sergey Viktorovich again? He's so clueless.
-Are you sure he's fit for the task? -It's Ania.
I see. By the way, it might not be her real name.
In any case, it's good you have put her to jail.
She's such a wretch. A person was blown up because of her.
-I could've lived much longer. -Let's change the subject.
Vasily Petrovich, don't get so upset.
This Mata Hari has a solid background.
You're neither the first one nor the last one.
Yurii Ivanovich, I got you. Well, many servants of the people have passed through her…
Well, many servants of the people have passed through her…
Well, let's say, through her hands.
-Yurii Ivanovich, I got you. -Yes…
Mr. Shcherbakov, the former Vice PM…
Mr. Kuniayev, the deputy head of NBU, Mr. Semionov, Mr. Labuta,
Mr. Derikon, Mr. Yanenko, and I…
I was the only one who resisted her.
It was the whole former Cabinet of Ministers, except me.
-Can you keep silent for a while? -Yes, of course.
Oh no, not the whole Cabinet. There were two women.
-But, knowing Anna Mikhailovna… -Enough!
I am sorry. Stop the car.
-Tolik, no! -Stay, Tolik.
So, according to the program, the documents' execution
and a business dinner were planned for today,
which are cancelled I guess.
Oh, we'll do our best to stick to our plan.
We'll just correct it a little bit, that's all.
Let's start with a dinner. What do you say?
Will the President be there?
No. He wasn't present at the documents' execution,
so, as we say here, "who doesn't work, doesn't eat".
It was a joke. Of course, he will be there.
Have a nice day.
Have a nice day.
I feel sorry for Yura.
He was a useful man.
But there's nothing you can do. It's life.
When the hen starts crowing, it gets slaughtered.
-Yes, that's a pity. -Do we owe you anything?
It's nothing. Forget about it.
Fine. Then let's stay in touch.
Funny, Misha.
Vasily Petrovich, do you know who this is?
-No. -Neither do I.
Hello, Bullet. How are you, Petia?
Foma… Vasily Petrovich, meet my friends.
Hello, Mother.
Did you have a mother?
I am sorry.
-What is it? -Something you need.
Compromising material on the oligarchs.
Did you make a hiding place of your mother's grave?
-It's a sacrilege. You're a monster. -Vasily Petrovich…
Say nothing but good of the dead. Let's go.
There's everything here, the schemes, the files,
the offshore accounts, the epigrams.
-The epigrams? -I like writing them.
I have one about you, too.
-Want to hear it? -No.
"He who fulfilled the people's dream, thought governing was so simple."
"But having governed for just a month,
-Vasily Petrovich screwed up…" -No need to continue.
The ending is too banal. Give that to me.
Vasily Petrovich, I have to warn you: if you misuse this,
you might become my neighbor.
-What do you suggest? -I will tell you a story.
There were three friends, Petia, Bullet and Foma.
The whole capital city was afraid of them,
from downtown to the bedroom community.
But there was a brave man who stood in their way.
Were you this brave man?
It doesn't matter. It happened long ago.
So they got very angry with him
and invited an assassin from the Caucasus mountains
to kill the brave man, as it was a usual thing back then.
Right, Foma?
The brave man found out about this plan.
And the three friends found out a lot, too.
Petia found out that Foma was his wife's lover.
Foma found out Bullet ratted him out to the police.
And Bullet found out Petia wanted to kick him out of business.
So they forgot about the brave man and killed each other.
What was this story for?
For you to understand you must do the same to the oligarchs.
Set them against each other, destroy their coalition
and strike deals with each of them, separately.
We have five days at the most.
What are your plans for today?
I was going to go to Lviv in the morning.
You'll go to Kharkiv instead.
The President is changing his plans.
Instead of meeting with the IMF,
he is going on a business trip around the country.
The President is planning to visit Kharkiv, Sumy and Ternopyl regions.
Vasily Petrovich, do you still hope to get the loan?
Yes, I do.
Are there any versions as to Chuiko's murder?
It's the investigatory privilege.
The PM's murder, the Parliament not adopting the laws,
the erosion of agreements with the IMF. Isn't it enough?
-No comments. -Vasily Petrovich!
-Hi. Where's Yurii Ivanovich? -In the compartment.
Wait, what if he is recognized?
Don't worry, Vaso. We've changed his appearance completely.
Even his mom wouldn't have recognized him.
Here's Yurii Ivanovich's remote control.
He wears a bracelet on his leg. If he tries to run away, he'll be zapped.
What made you change your plans so suddenly?
-Which berths do we have? -5 and 6.
Tolik, look.
This button will shake him. This one will fry him.
And this one is for medium well.
Oh, I am sorry.
Hello, Vasily Petrovich.
Hello.
I am impressed. I wouldn't have recognized you.
I recognized you right away.
Sure thing.
Oh wow.
The wrinkles, the hair, the pores - everything looks so natural.
And the dress! Where did you get it?
I wanted to change, you know.
-Would you mind waiting outside? -Why?
-You are a man, after all. -Yes.
And I am a woman!
Yes, from a distance. But at a close range… There are some flaws.
The secondary sex characteristics are still noticeable.
You must shave more carefully. Then it won't attract attention.
And these things… What is it? Polyurethane?
It's too hard. Should be softer for your age.
You had to make it harder here and softer here.
-And then it'll be… -What if I kick your butt?
I'll do that no matter who you are.
Oh, I am sorry.
Where's Yurii Ivanovich?
Is it normal to zap a living person?
Why are you looking at me?
Mika, Tolik said our berths were 5 and 6.
Why did some woman take those berths?
Compartments 5 and 6. Not berths.
So, Vasily Petrovich, how do you like my new image?
A crazy doctor?
-No, it's Mark Twain. -Oh, I see.
Are you learning Italian?
I am thinking about the afterlife.
Italy is a nice place for resurrection.
Sicily will suit you for sure.
Well, I was thinking about Capri.
Kharkiv, Yurii Ivanovich. Kharkiv!
Chickened out already? The main hobbit of Ukraine is coming for you.
No, I just thought…
Mikhail Semionovich, do you think
the President knows you and I are working together?
You got it wrong. You are working for me.
Don't you worry. Nobody knows about our business.
The governor of Kharkiv is Roizman's man.
All the money from the budget goes through his bank.
So, our main task is to convert the governor,
to convince him to choose Mamatov's bank instead of Roizman's.
The Ferris wheel in Gorky Park is the best place to do that.
-Why the Ferris wheel? -It's a perfect place.
No tapping or eavesdropping.
-The Ferris wheel. -The Ferris wheel…
-What if he recognizes you? -He will not.
Because you will talk to him.
-Me? -Yes.
No way. Impossible. He won't believe me.
If you don't show your true colors.
What are my true colors?
A money-grabber and a kleptocrat who loves kickback schemes.
I am a kleptocrat?
Tolia, we are just having a dispute here.
-I am a money-grabber? -Oh, please, stop it.
Do you think anyone believes this image of yours?
Even those who voted for you are now waiting and hoping to see
how much you are going to steal.
Don't let their hopes down.
-Do what's expected from you. -Enough!
SERGEY CALLING
I am sorry.
Vasia, it's about the international relations!
Rescheduling the meeting with the head of the delegation
is a worldwide scandal, do you get it?
I am not lying on the beach here, either.
These European dorks will ask me when you come here.
As soon as I have something to come with.
-Sergey! -Oh, wait!
Are you saying you are not going to come tomorrow, too?
-That's right. -Holy crap. Vasia! All right.
I'll deal with it.
But I really hope you know what you are doing.
I hope so, too.
Don't get in trouble, ok?
Nice song, huh? Why aren't you drinking?
A business dinner is not about drinking. It's about communicating.
The communication is better when you have vodka, Mr. Otto!
It's traditional for Ukraine.
Sorry, but my Grandma didn't tell me about these traditions.
It's fine. You will learn more in a moment. Gut?
Ja, gut.
Cheers.
No. This is the first traditional shot. You must drink it up.
Unless you intend to insult the host.
-I won't make it. -Play your part.
A money-grabber? I don't know how to play a money-grabber.
It's simple. I will teach you.
The most important thing is to keep silent and look.
-Is this necessary? -Yes.
I can't keep silent all the time.
If you want to say something, go ahead.
But like this, not out loud, like if you're talking to yourself.
-What? -Talk quietly.
-Why? -To make them bow.
Oh…
Here's that look. Remember it.
The second toast is to the happy life of the hosts.
-You must also drink it up. -Cheers.
Help yourself. The potatoes, lard and bacon…
We would like to see the President.
When is he going to be here?
No. It's a tradition.
Mikhalych, wait! Are you nuts, old man?
Get out! What are you doing? Oh God!
Tolik, I need to use the WC.
It's closed. The sanitary zone.
Tolik!
You are a real jerk, Tolik.
-Baby, open the door. I really need it. -Go to sleep, you old goat!
Cheers!
Please, tell me where the President is.
-Haven't I told you? -No.
Sergey Viktorovich. Sergey!
Are you out of your mind? Get up.
No. Give the minister a bit more time to sleep.
Leave quietly.
You blockhead, get up. We have a meeting in 30 minutes.
What meeting are we having, Oksana?
With the head of the IMF.
There will be no meeting at 11.
He will get up not earlier than 16:00.
-Go to bed. -Get up!
I don't know at what time he gets up. I don't care.
I'm responsible for you.
You must come to the meeting 10 minutes before it begins.
Sergey, you're a shame. Look at yourself. Take a shower, freshen up.
Blah-blah-blah! Oksana, you make a bad alarm clock.
Sergey…
Sergey Viktorovich. Mr. Minister.
I'm telling you again.
There won't be any appointment at 11, 12, or 13.
Hey!
-Good morning! -Good morning.
The meeting's at 11 am.
Yes. I remember.
Is he immortal?
Volodia, what about the President's cortege?
Don't worry, Taras. There will be a cortege.
At what time does the train arrive? Damn.
Pasha! Are we ready?
You're offending me, sir. We are 100% ready.
I hope it will be modest and not pompous.
Everything's according to the protocol.
Stop! Pasha, what's this?
The arc, the kids, the orchestra, the governmental employees.
Do you want me dead? What's all this for?
For the first visit of the President.
Have you forgotten who our President is? Idiot.
I'm surprised you didn't call the female drummers.
I did. Shouldn't I have?
That's a disaster.
It's a protocol. We have met all the Presidents like this.
Who did you meet? Take away the people.
Bury them, hide them, drown them!
-What's the President's train car? -5th.
Pravdiuk, do you hear me? It's Kovalev. Take the train one car ahead.
What should I do, Taras Andreevich?
Taras Andreevich, let's go.
I'm here.
Here.
-Taras Andreevich! -Don't follow me, you idiot!
Taras Andreevich, calm down.
-Where are we going? -To meet the President.
Pavlik, I think it's a failure.
If any journalist covers all this, I will…
On this sunny day Kharkiv streets are empty.
The hospitals are not working. The schools are empty.
The factories and plants have stopped working.
This is not a disaster. It's an arrival of the President to Kharkiv.
In the country where salaries are months late,
the President is met with great pompousness.
Yana, why are you lying to the people so boldly?
They meet the President over there.
Welcome to Kharkiv, Vasily Petrovich.
-Thank you. -Pardon me?
You're welcome, please.
Excuse me for such a modest reception.
But entertainment is not the purpose of your visit.
You are pressed in time and we have a lot to show you.
-Who are they meeting? -I have no idea.
You should have an idea.
This is how you should receive the President.
That's some great reception for taking the 9th place.
How would they meet us if we took the first place?
-What's this? -Escort, so to say.
Why not a route taxi? Where did you find this old rubbish?
In the regional car park.
They are nearly 100 years old, but they are still running.
We're saving money in such a way.
Is anything wrong?
This is not my level. Inappropriate for my status.
Mr. Mukhin, I hope you'll finally give me some clear information
about the President's whereabouts.
The President asked to excuse him.
Currently he is in Kyiv, holding final consultations with Rada.
How will you comment on the fact
that the President is currently in Kharkiv?
-What, Kharkiv? -The President is in Kharkiv.
Right, he is in Kharkiv, where else should he be?
Here, in Lviv.
He will come here after scattering the ashes.
The ashes?
In his last will, the Prime Minister asked to scatter his ashes above Kharkiv.
And who can do this? Only the incumbent President.
This is a tradition. But he will join us at the business dinner.
Have a nice day.
Did you understand what you just said?
I don't even want to recall.
Our main goal is to persuade him
to change Roizman's bank for Mamatov's bank.
So, you're saying that Roizman is getting 5%
from the utility payments of the entire city?
Me? I am not saying this.
No? Taras Andreevich, let's speak in direct terms.
I need a specific service from you.
For you, anything you want, Mr. President.
And the best place for this is the Ferris wheel.
-Our pride. 55 meters… -Let's take a ride.
Sure. Volodia, you're going with the President.
Is Volodia the governor now? I want you to join me.
For a private conversation.
I would love to, but I can't. I'm acrophobic.
-What? -I have a terrible fear of heights.
Anything you want, except the Ferris wheel.
I need to make an important call.
Acrophobic, oh God.
Damn.
-Yes. -Yurii Ivanovich. It won't work.
-He's acrophobic. -What?
He has a terrible fear of heights.
I won't be able to get him to the Ferris wheel.
What does the Ferris wheel have to do with it?
You told me. The Ferris wheel.
Talk to him at the Ferris wheel.
I could say anything. I just liked this idea.
So? A Ferris wheel is not a must?
Talk anywhere, far from other people's ears.
-Work on this. -I got it.
Look. To hell with this Ferris wheel.
-I have an idea. -Wonderful.
I want the budgetary money to be serviced at the Otrada Bank.
This is Mamatov's bank. It's a dirty bank.
Is Roizman's bank clean?
It has passed all the inspections and won the bid.
Taras Andreevich, to hell with Roizman and Mamatov.
Let's talk about you.
-I'm scared… -You should be.
All the gas stations in the city belong to your wife.
I'm divorced.
All the city pavement is produced at your cousin's plant.
It's a lie, he's my brother!
It's good that you don't have a sister.
And now let's talk about your property.
Sugar refinery. Chemical complex. Even this rollercoaster is yours.
That's 15 years' term with full confiscation.
So? One more round?
-Or a talk about Mamatov? -Mamatov!
All right.
Is it a deal, then? We'll bring the money through Mamatov's bank
with the same 5%.
Why five? 10 for you!
10% from the budget?
15? Okay. They can use old trams for one more year.
They won't die.
20! It's complicated, but we will do this.
We'll decrease the status of the Chornobyl victims.
The cleaning facilities can wait.
After all, Kharkiv without broken sewage
is like Venice without the canals.
What? 30? Vasily Petrovich, you should be more moderate.
Why everything at once? You are here for more than a year.
Then we can make it 50%,
but people will start rallying in the streets.
Then you will have to send the National Guard.
I'll break your back, you bastard! Stop!
30% of the budget?!
-That's what you wanted! -I will show you, jerk!
Vasily Petrovich! People are looking!
Now he's talking about people! I'll kill you!
Something incredible is going on in the Gorky Park.
President Goloborodko is chasing the governor around the park…
We had a plan!
Sorry. I couldn't help myself when he mentioned 30%.
I don't care even if he said 100, 200 or 300!
This is not the purpose of our trip.
I don't know what to do. We had a wonderful gambit.
How could you be such an idiot?
Tolik!
Do that again. Imbecile.
Stop it.
Yes! We will do a castling then.
We'll appoint Mamatov's man the governor.
-Who do you mean? -Vasiliuk Ivan Sergeevich.
Come on. He is totally corrupt.
-Vasiliuk won't become the governor. -Yes, he will.
President Goloborodko appoints Vasiliuk the new governor of Kharkiv region.
The President thinks
that only Vasiliuk will be able to bring order to the region.
Goloborodko also expressed his hope for fruitful cooperation
and promised any support on his part.
-I'm listening. -No, I am listening to you!
-What do you mean? -Don't play fool.
You're a bad actor.
What does this bullshit with Vasiliuk in Kharkiv means?
What is this?
-This is life, Misha. -I have heard you.
Son of a bitch.
Good evening. We will start our show with the main news.
The leader of the parliamentary faction Dobrobut stated the following.
We have considered all pros and cons and have decided that our faction
would vote for the President's laws and maybe leave the coalition.
What kind of circus is this, Mikhail Semionovich?
It wasn't me who started it, right, Rustem Ashotovich?
Misha, have you been eating too much matzoh?
I'm telling you again. It was the President who fired your governor.
God, you're so polite now.
Yesterday you called him a loser, a nobody, and today he is the President.
What are you accusing me of?
Of having agreements with Goloborodko?
I am not accusing you. I am stating the fact.
Goloborodko has appointed your man.
How did he find out it was my man?
Are you saying it was a coincidence?
Gentlemen, have you come here to fight? Calm down.
Everything is clear to me, an uninterested person.
-Who knew Tsitsik was your man? -No one.
Who knew Vasiliuk was your man?
Only the person we buried the day before yesterday.
I conclude that this is simply a coincidence.
It happens sometimes. So, Misha, you're wrong.
-Why would I… -Misha!
-Andrey! -Misha!
I'm sorry, Ashotych, I was wrong. I've overreacted.
Hopefully, the statement of your faction is just to make noise with the mandates?
Of course. No one is going to vote.
Let's consider then that the conflict is over.
Mr. President, I want to thank you for your trust again.
I will be a worthy successor to my predecessor.
I have no doubts about that.
I'm sorry. Do you want a cortege?
Five to eight cars?
The distance is not long, though.
Give my best to the governor of Sumy region.
-Tolik, are we going to the hotel? -No.
-I think we need to pick up something. -I've picked it up.
-Where is it? -In the trunk.
-What do you mean? -Your luggage is in the trunk.
I don't mean the luggage. Something else.
-Do you understand? -No.
-Where's the uncle? -The uncle?
Uncle.
-What uncle? -Did we take many uncles with us?
-Where's my uncle? -Your uncle?
-He's not mine. -Not your uncle?
No, our Uncle Yura.
Tolik, I think Vasily Petrovich means me.
-I'm here. The uncle is with you. -I can see that.
How did the meeting go? Didn't you bite off Vasiliuk's head?
What's the point? I'll bite one, he'll grow three new ones.
Vasily Petrovich, let's make a deal.
No more improvisations. But I must praise you.
Your improvisation with Tsitsik has brought its fruit.
Romanchenko said their faction was going to vote for your laws.
-Seriously? Well, that's cool. -I wouldn't be so happy.
I think he will deny this information tomorrow morning.
-Why? -It doesn't matter.
The ice broke up and gears are creaking, that's the main thing.
Okay. What are our plans in Sumy?
What plans can we have in Sumy, if we're going to Zaporizhzhia?
-How? -Fast enough.
We need to go to the hotel.
-Why? -To take the uncle.
-Tolik! -Tolik!
Mr. Minister,
you promised me. You swore that he would be here tonight.
-Who? -The President.
Oh.
This is a tradition. Ukrainian tradition.
-Cheers! -The traditional fourth shot…
Stop it.
Otto, ask me where the President is.
Where's the President?
A tradition. Fill the glasses.
Come on, Petrovich, don't be lazy. A couple more circles.
Do you want to leave the city without me?
I don't care whether you're a mayor or the minister of sport.
I would sweat your guts out.
Come on. Move it!
What is it?
Petrovich, the President is in Zaporizhzhia.
-What? -The President is in Zaporizhzhia.
What do you mean? He was supposed to go to Sumy.
-But he has come to Zaporizhzhia. -Damn. I'll be there in a sec.
-Here you are. -Nice running! You're doing well!
-Palych, stop! -Come on!
You can do it, if you want to! Very well!
Palych, stop, I'm telling you!
Don't talk, breathe normally!
-I will make an Apollo out of you! -I will kill you!
Come on! Finish it!
President Goloborodko has changed the plan of his business trip.
Instead of Sumy, he has gone to Zaporizhzhia.
There the President had a strict talk with the local state officials.
Isn't it cool? Do you like it? What is this?
Numerous difficulties have prevented us
from completing the construction of the bridge.
How? It is completed. Here is the bridge. Look. A monolith! Beautiful!
And the second one is over there. And the third one is over there.
It's a special technology. The newest one. Nano-bridges.
Transparent and crystal. It's an important thing.
Four billion from the state budget.
No, tell me. Maybe they just didn't tell me.
Maybe the ZAZ has invented a new Tauria model. A flying Tauria.
So, we don't need any bridges or roads.
The bridge is not our fault. The developer was careless.
And you failed to build the cardiologic center
for the very same reason.
Right, why would you need a cardiologic center?
You don't have a heart. Where's your mayor?
He has been hospitalized with a probable heart attack.
Thank God, someone does have a heart here.
Okay, let's go back to the bids.
For the bridge, for the roads, for the dam - everything is clean here.
Filed for different legal companies. But there is one problem.
All these companies have the same founder, Rustem Mamatov.
Maybe I don't know something again.
Maybe there are bids in which you can win a whole region.
Or maybe even a country.
It's quite possible that there have been such auctions.
But we haven't been invited there.
Vasily Petrovich, we were going to discuss
all these questions in two hours.
Discuss them and then tell me the result.
And one more thing. If I hear again
that the cleaning facilities at Zaporizhstal Plant
are switched on only before the arrival of the President,
I will put all of you into a pipe.
-Are there enough pipes? -Yes.
At least you have enough of something.
Vasily Petrovich!
What made you change the plan of your trip? Why Zaporizhzhia?
I found the facts confirming corruption in this region.
By the way, my special gratitude for the information and documents
to the journalist Sergey Biriukov.
-What was that, Misha? -I am shocked myself.
Why are you playing fool? You're a bad actor.
I think someone is implying something.
I'm not implying. I am speaking directly.
Misha, you're a scum.
Yesterday we celebrated a peace truce.
And now you arrange such an insidious act behind my back?
Watch your tongue. I have nothing to do with this.
Wait. Are you saying that your pocket journalist Biriukov
dared to speak without your command?
Am I a fool to tell him to do such a thing?
How would you explain it?
How do I know? Ask him yourself.
-I will. -All right.
-I will! -Do that!
-I will ask him! -Go ahead!
Gentlemen, he will be brought here soon.
-What's going on? -It's gratitude.
I would have killed you with this door in Kharkiv.
But here you did everything clean. Bravo!
No questions. You can do it when you want to.
Vasily Petrovich! What a nice surprise.
I've been told that we are having a special guest.
But I didn't expect to see you.
Well, it's here. Let's go. I will show you.
Ladies and gentlemen. This festive entourage…
Mr. President, please, come in.
…the exclusive Bentley presented to the woman of the hour…
-Where are we going? -Don't worry, everything is under control.
-Please. This is your table. -My table?
Yes. Everything you like. Small pies, red caviar, sterlet.
-Sterlet? -Yes.
Meet Verka Serdiuchka.
Doesn't the light and sound bother you?
Maybe, Serdiuchka…
-No. -Okay.
Have a seat. I will call the birthday girl.
Wait. Who is the birthday girl? Are we really supposed to be here?
It's the birthday of the first lady. Where else could you be?
-My first lady? -No, Zaporizhzhia's first lady.
-She's the mayor's wife. -Excuse me, we are not invited.
Vasily Petrovich! You are always invited. You are the President.
Listen, this is a misunderstanding.
-I must go. -Mr. President!
-Hello. -At least say hi to the mayor.
How can I say hi to the mayor who is in a hospital?
-What do you mean? -My sweetheart!
My heart.
-You…! -Vasily Petrovich! Brace yourself.
I think we should leave.
Calm down. It's all right.
Why are you so nervous, Vasily Petrovich?
A Bentley made the woman happy.
Happy? People use taxies for their entire lives.
Those are people. Someone has to drive a Bentley.
Maybe people should drive Bentleys.
Then it will be a route taxi, not a Bentley.
-Please, come in. -Thank you.
Come in, Vasily Petrovich.
Whose room is this?
It's the President's suite. You are still the President.
So, it makes sense. Don't you like it?
No, why? It doesn't matter whether I like it.
A standard room would be fine.
I admire your asceticism. Did you have Spartans in your family?
Stop clowning around, Yurii Ivanovich.
We come into this world naked, and we will leave it naked.
Vasily Petrovich, but you've missed a tiny thing
between the arrival and the departure.
It's life. No, if you want to live a life of a nudist,
you're welcome. I don't mind.
But I prefer to take everything from this life.
Yes, I have seen the 11 volumes of your criminal case.
Where you took everything from life.
-Twelve. -Like Hercules' heroic deeds.
What was that for, Yurii Ivanovich?
Grabbing, stealing, stepping on people, being a scum for the entire country?
Why would you need all these billions?
Do they warm up your soul? Do they boost your ego?
What are all these for, Yurii Ivanovich?
The tables, the chandeliers? The luxurious chambers?
-Coffins have no pockets. -And the terrace.
Terrible. These huge terraces, spacious balconies…
What do you need them for?
The view is amazing.
-Maybe for this? -Yes…
What are our plans?
What plans? We're taking seats in the front row.
We'll wait for the news and enjoy the triumph.
-Do you hear the rattle? -What rattle?
The coalition is being demolished.
Ka-pow! I'm offering you a bet.
Who will be the first to leave the coalition?
Zhanna and her democrats? Or Romanchenko with his radicals?
I think it will be Zhanna. What about you?
I think, Yurii Ivanovich,
I need to call and personally thank Biriukov.
-For what? -He gave me important information
behind Roizman's back.
No. He has nothing to do with this. The info is mine.
What do you mean? The documents… You told me…
I didn't tell you everything. It doesn't matter.
You've achieved your goal. The rest is history.
Do you realize that you exposed the man?
He's not a good man. He deserved to be exposed.
Can you imagine what they will do to him?
They will cripple him. Kill at maximum. Vasily Petrovich!
It's very inappropriate to intrude someone's private life.
-Do you agree with me? -No.
Then call him and apologize.
Vasily Petrovich, stop panicking.
Everything will be fine with Sergey. Fine. Just fine.
-Dork! -Why are you pushing him?
-Why are you pushing him? -Why did you give him to me?
You wanted to question him. Go ahead!
Am I a cop to question him?
Rustem, what will you drink?
It can wait! Is this the first time he exposed us?
Remember his attacks on me for Kyivgas?
For the heat and power authority? For Azovmetal?
Did he order you to do this?
Why are you asking him? Come on.
Ask about the truck with Polish illegal vodka.
-Misha, let's have a drink. -Let's!
-Let's! -Let's!
-Let's! -Let's!
-So, yes or no? -Andrey!
I don't want to drink!
Explain me please in plain language,
what would I gain from attacking you now?
You're taking revenge for Kharkiv.
-What Kharkiv, damn you? -Sergey, come here, drink with me.
Why are you standing here? Can't you see? We are talking.
-You did it. I have a gut feeling. -That's it.
An unjustified and ungrounded assault.
Gentlemen, calm down. Sergey is here, well and alive. Ask him.
Why are you swimming there? You toad!
Have you come here to swim?
Rustem Ashotovich! I swear, I didn't leak anything to anyone.
I learned about Goloborodko's statement post factum.
I have never contacted the President.
I have never been in touch with him.
He has never been in touch with him! What else did you say?
-I have never contacted him. -He has never contacted him!
He doesn't like to contact people.
I have checked his phone contacts. It's clean.
-Give it to me. -What's this? PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION
PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION
-Oh my. -Put it on speaker.
-Hello? -Hello, Sergey.
Hello.
Excuse me, Sergey. It was a mistake.
I got the information on Mamatov from a different source.
-But I have named you. I am sorry. -It's okay.
I thought that if you had such information,
you would have given it to me. No?
Yeah…
Sure.
Frankly speaking, these Nemchuks, Roizmans, Mamatovs,
they are sucking the blood out of the country.
If I could, I would have returned death penalty.
The death would've been long and painful.
This is a wonderful idea.
Between you and me, who would you have started with?
With Mamatov.
With Mamatov? That's a great idea.
Thank you very much again. I am really sorry, Sergey.
Sergey who?
Biriukov.
Did you just call Biriukov and apologize?
Yes. I think it was an honest thing to do.
So, I am developing a plan, thinking every detail thoroughly,
and you flush it down the toilet with one phone call?
Don't be so dramatic.
I have no energy or desire to shout at you.
It was just a call.
You are an idiot!
Have it ever occurred to you that this scum records all phone calls?
-I didn't even think about it. -You should have.
I asked you not to improvise. Wasn't Kharkiv enough for you?
By the way, you praised me in Kharkiv.
Enough!
Enough!
Enough!
On the other hand, Tolik, we've exposed the man.
I had to apologize.
But maybe he's right.
I'm going to the bar!
Don't even try to stop me!
Good luck, Sergey!
Call me when you reach the opposite bank.
Rustem, you accused the man for no reason.
This is a strange coincidence.
There's nothing strange about it. This is a law of balance.
You won in Kharkiv, you lost in Zaporizhzhia.
Who would think that our teacher would be stirring up trouble?
He's small, but he's stinky. Son of a bitch!
It's okay. We will take revenge on this stinkpot.
That's a good idea.
It's so nice here.
-I don't even want to leave. -Why would you leave? You're home.
To Odessa. My daughter is getting married.
How's our revenge?
It's on its way.
Vasia will learn some stuff about Zaporizhzhia hospitality.
Scotch.
Tolia, why are you standing as if you were at a parade ground? Have a seat, relax.
-Here. -Thanks.
Tolia, did you see my briefcase?
Damn it, Tolik!
-Another one? -Yes, please.
Here you go.
You imbecile! If you do it again…
I can't hear you.
Tolia, order something to eat.
-Another one? -A bottle!
Good afternoon. Which room is the President staying in?
-I'm sorry. Who are you? -We are journalists.
We want to interview Vasily Petrovich.
Room 604.
Thank you. From the entire Union of Journalists, so to say.
Mukhin, I understand everything. But I'm not idling here either.
You're having a liver ache, and my brain is blowing out.
-Quickly and no talking. -What do you mean, quickly?
First, I'm not going to drink, especially with you.
Tolik, we have company.
-What company? -Out, quickly.
Where are we going?
Who are they?
The Journalist Trade Union. Biriukov says hi.
Hi!
-Would you like to call someone else? -Be quiet!
Come here!
Come on!
What shall we do now?
Don't even think about it!
Please, I beg you. Just 10 minutes, is all.
Please, you should understand me.
Only two songs. Is it so hard?
Vera, come on. I beg you.
-I'm Andrey! -Sorry, Andrey.
Damn, let us change, ok?
We have a plane to catch. Don't bug me.
You have a plane, and I…
Be quiet. Wait a sec. Igor, get him out of here…
-Please, get out. -Wait. You misunderstood me.
Learn to work and behave properly.
But listen… We have worked.
There are two entrances and no exits. What are we going to do now?
-Look for the third one. -Where?
Quiet!
We got a little lost.
Vera, please. The birthday girl is ready to double your fee.
Vera! God, I'm so glad you've agreed!
I love you so much. Come on. Let's go.
Guys! The party goes on.
Everything will be okay!
Sweetie, give it to me. Vera! Mother! Come on.
Go, Yurii Ivanovich. Hello.
-Sing. -You're Verka Serdiuchka. You sing.
-I can't. -I'm your mother. I know better.
Everyone must dance! It's an order!
Mr. Mukhin, maybe you don't need this loan after all.
The President is not here.
The laws haven't been adopted.
The laws have been adopted, he's in Rada.
He will come here for dinner.
Listen. I want to hear this from the President personally.
Do you want me to call the President right now?
-Yes. -This very moment?
-Yes. -No problem.
Sergey, I can't talk right now. I'm busy.
You don't need to talk to me. You will be talking to Mr. Otto…
Adelweindsteiner.
Ja?
Guten Abend, Adel… Badel…
-Sorry, I don't speak German. -We can speak Ukrainian.
Okay. Goodbye.
I don't think the President is in Rada right now.
-He's at some party. -What party?
-Didn't you hear the song? -It's not a song.
This is the anthem,
which is performed after the approval of every law.
We're leaving.
-Hi. -Hi there.
We've warmed up the audience. Go on.
I thought my afterlife would be different.
Yes!
-Where is Tolik? -It's his job. Everything will be fine.
Come on!
Speed up!
-Yurii Ivanovich, there are cops. -How can these hipsters help?
Push away the thugs with their selfie sticks?
I'm a Doctor of Science. I'm a winner of Shevchenko prizes.
I know Merkel personally. I know Dalai Lama and Clinton.
And what am I doing? Wandering in the back of the beyond.
Riding a stupid van with a shaggy wheel.
Wearing women's tights, accompanied by some teacher.
Who could've predicted I'd call all those goblins with only one call?
-I made a mistake. -Just one?
-Okay, two mistakes. -Are you counting?
Do you want to earn a certain number of failures?
Why are you grumbling like an old woman? Stop it.
Where are we going, anyway?
Yurii Ivanovich! They've caught up with us.
-Go faster. -I'm going at full throttle!
-Where are you going? -To the bridge!
-There's no bridge! -There is! I opened it.
You opened nothing but expensive wine!
I was the mayor of Zaporizhzhia.
-Then I'm surprised the city survived. -There is a bridge.
-I want fries. -What do fries have to do with this?
Well, I have the right for one wish before I die.
-There is a bridge. -I want fries!
If you didn't steal, we could've been saved.
Do you want to talk about it?
-Let's go. -I know what to do.
-Are you comfortable, Vasily Petrovich? -I'm fine.
-They are catching up. -I can see that.
Don't you want to do something?
What can I do? If I had a gun, I'd shoot at them.
What do you want me to do? Throw cakes at them?
Grisha, are you on the yacht?
They have lost their minds with this decommunization.
CONSTIPATION
Stop! I'm the guarantor of the Constitution!
I swore to love my people.
But I can love seven people less.
Back off!
All right.
Vasily Petrovich! Stop showing off. Jump!
Grisha, ahead full speed!
You have no conscience.
What have you been taught at school, you thugs?
We've had a good time.
I can't remember when we have last gathered like this.
-At Yura's funeral. -Yes, it was terrible indeed.
We thank the host for the warm reception.
It's not as warm as Vasia's in Zaporizhzhia.
-Bye. -Thank you.
Say hi to Odessa. I'm going to relax tomorrow too.
Moose hunting with my faction.
What moose?
-Tomorrow Rada will vote for the PM. -Is it tomorrow?
Tomorrow is indeed a historic day. Especially for our historian.
Hopefully it won't take us long like the last time.
No, we'll act according to our agreement.
According to our agreement. What was the agreement?
We'll elect the Prime Mister and dump the President.
Tomorrow?
-Bye. -Bye.
Wait, I don't understand.
Tomorrow we are electing the PM.
I understand this. And dumping Goloborodko.
And dumping Goloborodko.
-But when will I hunt the moose? -After we elect the Prime Minister!
Vasilisa Petrovna, aren't the tights itchy?
Maybe you should change.
Or are you stuck to your female image?
Come down here.
Here you go.
Be careful. It's your size.
It's inappropriate. These are some stranger's things.
Why some stranger's?
-Whose yacht is this? -It's my friend's.
-Who is this? Cousteau? -Yes, my friend Cousteau.
Why are your photos everywhere?
Because Cousteau loved and respected me.
Come on, change.
What a nice weather.
-Don't you want to swim? -I want to drown.
As you wish. I would dive with pleasure.
Wow!
A bowtie, boxers. The President who hasn't been given the loan.
I suggest drinking to you without clinking glasses.
Oh, stop it.
Thank you. You'd better think about what to do now.
What to do? You're going to Kakhovka, I'm going to Capri.
What a nice captain we have. Hands of gold.
Treat yourself. Morning take.
A shrimp in a river? How?
We have a rich country.
Look at this hat. He's a master of origami.
Stop.
You've asked me what to do.
You need to go to the capital urgently to congratulate the new Prime Minister.
Rada will vote for Karasiuk tomorrow.
-How? -I think, unanimously.
They've taken advantage of my absence and pushed their Karasiuk through.
Vasily Petrovich, you have nothing to do with this.
Tomorrow it will be two months.
-What two months? -You amaze me. You're like a kid.
-I'd better go have a swim. -What two months?
Have you read the Constitution? I don't think so.
If the parliament fails to elect the Prime Minister
within two months, it can be what?
What?
What?
It can be dissolved!
So, I can make the council vote for the laws
under the threat of dissolution?
-Bravo! -That's brilliant!
Why are you so glad?
Do you know how to break up the voting for Karasiuk?
-No, I don't. -Too bad.
That would have solved all the problems.
Then forget about it and go to Capri with me.
He's not answering his phone.
-Hello. -Hello, Vasia, where are you?
-I'm in Capri. I'm on a yacht. -Good for you.
Anyway, I don't care where you are, on the Moon or wherever.
If you don't come to the business dinner before 22:00,
I promise to break the diplomatic relations with Germany,
Uganda and South Korea, and to return to performing.
-Do you get it? -Sergey, calm down.
I will come. I promise. I will personally apologize to Mr. Adel… vadent.
It's easy to pronounce. Adelweinsteiner.
Adelweinsteiner.
-To him, too. -Thanks a lot.
Thank God, there will be one day without alcohol and round dancing.
Yurii Ivanovich! I don't know where you're rushing to,
but I need to go to Lviv.
-At what time does Rada convene? -Tomorrow at 15:00.
Call Mukhin and tell him we need one more day.
-Where are we going? -I am going to Odessa.
Now ask me altogether where the President is.
No! Quiet! No clapping! Quiet!
Cheers.
Test.
Test.
Is Boria in Hamburg? Tell him to call me.
Rustem Ashotovich, you have a guest.
That's interesting.
I have made myself at home. Is it okay?
I can spare some whiskey for a good person.
I need to talk to you.
Wake up, Count. Great deeds are awaiting us.
-Do we have time? -Of course, every minute is counted.
Let's have breakfast. We'll arrive soon.
You see, Ashotovich, here's the thing. I have a bad feeling.
-What feeling? -A bad feeling.
First he fires my governor, then he appoints your man.
Wait. Then all this fuss in Zaporizhzhia.
What's your conclusion?
I don't know.
But I feel like there's a trap.
Something is not right.
Yurii Ivanovich, why are you so slow? We are short of time.
Don't worry.
We're already there. Hi, Vera Borysovna!
Look who's here! Why didn't you call me, shameless?
-Mom, please don't start. -I'm starting it?
Being dead is not an excuse for not calling your mom.
Can we come in or will we tell neighbors the truth?
-Come in! -Wait, Yurii Ivanovich. Whose mom?
Whose mom? My mom.
Who is buried there? There was a gravestone.
There is no one. I just claimed a good place at a graveyard.
Mom! Mommy! I've missed you so much! We need a suit.
I knew that you came because you needed something.
Right now.
Sergey Leonidovich, how did the future PM sleep?
When your conscience is clean, your sleep soundly.
-What will your first order be? -Wait.
Don't be splitting the skin of the bear which hasn't been killed yet.
Ladies and gentlemen, we will talk after the voting.
What about your reforming program?
What are you going to do with the dollar rate?
-How do I look? -So handsome!
And the final touch.
-Yurii Ivanovich! -We have time.
-It's 14:30. -Everything is under control.
-God help us. -Don't bother Him. We'll cope on our own.
Sergey Leonidovich, why don't I see the Prime Minister among the guests?
Knock the wood, Andrey Nikolaievich. I'm entering the hall.
Why are you worrying? It's my daughter who gets married.
So come on. Finish with your business and come here.
Misha, you're delirious.
Do you think our teacher stirred up trouble on his own?
-You can also say that I helped him. -Maybe you did. I don't know.
It's better to overreact than to be careless.
You're paranoid, Misha. Paranoid.
It's possible. These days are hard.
-You know, stressful. -Everything is okay.
Rada will elect the Prime Minister soon.
And things will get better.
I declare the parliamentary session open.
Ukraine's glory has not yet died
Nor died her freedom
Dear guests, meet our beautiful bride.
Do you want an exchange?
I will give you the Ministry of Social Policy,
and you'll give me the Ministry of Industry?
I may be paranoid, Ashotych, but I'm not an idiot.
Kiss the bride!
Now you are together. You two are one.
The halves are now a whole.
A long and happy life is awaiting you.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special guest. Welcome him.
The President of Ukraine, Vasily Petrovich Goloborodko.
Thank you. I couldn't but come. What an event.
My congratulations, dear. Mother!
My congratulations!
That's my goddaughter. She has become such a beauty.
-Do I know you? -She doesn't recognize me. She's grown up.
The bridegroom is such a strong man.
My congratulations, buddy. How do you like the surprise?
Congratulations. This is a great joy. Why are we standing silent?
Kiss the bride!
Kiss the bride!
Kiss the bride!
Dear members of parliament.
We are voting for the candidature of Sergey Leonidovich Karasiuk
for the post of the Prime Minister of Ukraine.
Please, vote.
Unexpectedly to everyone,
Rada failed to approve Sergey Karasiuk's candidature
for the post of the Prime Minister.
Yet another victory of the President.
Today Rada has approved the package of anti-corruption laws
Ukraine needed to get the IFM loan, with the majority of votes.
-That's it. -Yes.
-When are you going to Lviv? -In 30 minutes.
-Economy class, I hope. -Naturally.
We haven't received the loan yet.
I'm glad you stick to your principles.
My homeland is in reliable hands. So long.
-Yurii Ivanovich. -Yes?
I never thought I would tell you this.
Thank you.
You are a good man.
Not that bad.
Tolerable.
-Shall we hug? -No. That would be too much.
Ok.
Vasily Petrovich!
I won't forgive myself if I don't tell you.
Vasia, I am your Father.
I've always liked this scene from the Star Wars.
-Come visit me in Capri. -Thank you.
Be careful, electrician.
-Yurii Ivanovich, you forgot. -It's a souvenir for you.
Your passport.
Thank you for your care. I have one though.
But as the saying goes, there can't be too many passports.
Giuseppe Gravedigger.
I've always liked your subtle Armenian sense of humor.
There's no need to see me off. I will go alone.
After the necessary laws were adopted,
President Goloborodko immediately arrived in Lviv.
Together with Minister Mukhin, he went to the Pototskys' Palace,
where the signing of the agreement
with the IMF is going to start any minute now.
Frankly, we have given up on you.
But you have done your job.
Now we see no obstacles for your country to get this loan.
Thank you.
Okay. Let's talk about the additional terms.
-Okay. What are the terms? -They are standard.
A few small things that must be done.
Okay, clause 1.
The extraction of the shale gas.
-We don't have it. -You will.
But it will kill our soil. And the agriculture…
It must be curtailed to 50%. Growing of wheat - to 70%.
Agriculture is an important source to fill our budget.
I cannot even imagine the losses we will suffer.
It's okay. You will find another source. This is our second term.
A deposit for nuclear waste in Chornobyl area.
Of course, all the modern safety technologies must be kept.
If you manage to broaden the area to the boundaries of the region,
Ukraine will never have any problems.
-Life will be happy, stable… -And short.
-Wait… -It won't do.
Your "wait" costs us too much.
We have already wasted too much time on your country.
More than it is worth.
Vasily Petrovich, give it a thought.
It means big money, huge opportunities.
You will have your own party. Parliamentary majority.
A public fund, for your personal usage.
2-3% from 15 billion. I think it's not bad.
But if you need more time to think, if something is not clear…
No. Everything is clear to me.
I want to thank the head of the IMF and the members of the board
for the time they've spent with us.
And for the talk that was very rich in content.
With a feeling of deep gratitude, I want to say…
Go to hell.
And this term must be fulfilled. Am I clear enough?
We're not beggars. We're not migrant workers.
I want you to remember once and for all. We're not an outskirt.
We're not a border region between orks and elves.
We are a normal, strong, beautiful, and rich country.
The fact that we're now down on our backs is not a reason to screw us.
I am really grateful to you for opening my eyes.
Now I can see clearly
that we are indeed standing on the edge of an abyss.
But we still have a chance to become a great country.
We are the nation of open, clever, and talented people.
We must understand this,
we must understand we should respect ourselves,
be ashamed to steal, should roll up our sleeves and work hard,
instead of shouting "Shame on you!" or "It's a betrayal!"
with or without any reason…
You can't build Ukraine simply by talking.
We need to stop measuring who's more patriotic,
dividing Ukrainians into friends and foes.
On the contrary, we need to unite.
Then
the whole world, not only Ukrainians,
will say, "Glory to Ukraine!"
THEN THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN."
Hey?
What?
Ever wondered why reggae songs always start with a drumroll?
You serious? You wanna talk about that now?
You don't wanna know?
Spill, if you're bursting to tell me.
The drumroll is the sound of the cannons bringing down the walls of Babylon.
What's Babylon?
Babylon is a city putrid with capitalism and corruption.
Capitalists, don't worry. I'll take care of them.
What's he doing?
Look at that son of a bitch. Go on.
Shit!
GOLD BRICK
BREUIL & SONS NUMBER ONE IN CHARTRES
My name is Daniel Sauveur.
I was born in Chartres. Central France.
In the middle of nowhere.
My mom had one dream.
To have a view of the cathedral.
Even though it was from a distance, Dad gave it to her before leaving us.
The Breuils took that too.
The Breuils are the most loaded family in town.
From father to son.
There are Breuils in your town too.
The ones who crush you with the heel of their shoes.
They don't even mean to do it, those idiots.
I learned that if you want a nice view, there's no choice.
You have to hustle to get to the top. Especially on top of the Breuils.
So I began to watch them to understand how they got there.
-You know what? -Hi.
There's nothing to understand.
-Thinking of you. -Thanks.
Some people are born with, and some without. That's it.
Your mother is waiting for you.
In Chartres, there's Breuil & Sons,
and way further down, there's everyone else.
Every Wednesday, Breuil Sr. ate at this place with his son, Patrick.
The little one there.
He probably doesn't know it, but we went to the same elementary school.
-Two coffees for table four. -I only have two hands!
This is Unc.
I have the veal!
-My father's best friend. -Go!
He looked after us after he died.
-You seen the kid? -No.
Every Wednesday, I spent the day with him here, at the Beaux Arts,
the Michelin-starred restaurant.
-I told you to stay in the kitchen. -Look, Unc.
Look at the woman, table 25.
Mrs. Breuil?
You see her bag? She's left it behind two Wednesdays in a row.
-So what? -I have a plan.
Mrs. Breuil! You forgot your bag, madam.
Thanks, that's kind. For you.
Mom.
Here.
When you're from Chartres, you learn it early on.
The Breuils always win.
There was a time when people started naming their kids
after their favorite brands.
That's how my best friend found himself with the name Scania.
Like the trucks.
He hated the Breuils too.
His dad worked as a trucker for them, so he never got to see him.
When I lost my father,
some kids at school started calling me "bastard."
And Scania made them pay every time.
So I share everything with him.
Fifty-fifty.
Hey, see you.
When we got older,
we swore never to work for the Breuils like our fathers had.
We set up our own business.
It wasn't dumb. It worked.
All right, Coz?
Except that here, all roads lead to…
Breuil & Sons of bitches.
Like everyone else, we ended up working for the Breuils.
Way too much.
Over 90% of your turnover comes from us.
Economic dependence. Sorry. I don't make the rules.
Hey, give me that!
Economic dependence is when you do too much business with one client.
-Apparently, that's not good. -Let go!
Stop.
Get lost!
Because we didn't have any other clients and owed money to the bank,
we were done for.
We had no choice.
Scania had to take a job as a driver for Breuil.
I held out another three months, but a man's gotta eat, right?
What the hell are you doing? Smoke break's over. Give me that.
That's him.
Is that him?
Daniel Sauveur, sir.
-Save the formality. Call me "boss." -Boss.
Have you told your buddy how things work?
How things work?
Let me explain. I have free rein over who I hire and fire around here.
I'll give you a short-term contract for six months.
At the end of that, Breuil Sr. will pay you a 10% indemnity, 900 euros.
That's it? 900 euros and no trade-offs?
It's the law, but don't get excited.
You're going to give me that bonus in cash.
-50% now, 50% at the end of the contract. -What?
Otherwise, I'll fire you during your trial period.
Pay up and I'll keep you on.
Same thing, 50 at the end, 50 when you start.
But I don't have 450 euros right now. I've got nothing.
Your buddy said he'd take care of it.
Thanks.
-Why are you giving money to that wimp? -This way, you have a job.
And that's how, after taking over the whole town, the Breuils got me too.
The locals see working here as a step-up.
They reckon they're doing something high-end.
The global distribution of Parisian luxury.
The quintessence of the French psyche.
Givenchy, Dior, Saint Laurent.
The whole shebang. Anyway, you get the picture.
In reality, those luxury brands send their perfume to Breuil in cubes,
and we put them in bottles, boxes, cardboard boxes, and pallets.
Then we deliver them to big clients across the world.
I started out in quality control for Colin Brown.
It's a big American luxury brand.
You know? The black and white ads with guys and chicks in jeans.
I've seen it all come through.
CB Gold, of course.
CB X-treme, when techno was back on the club scene.
CB Green for the eco-friendly crowd.
I even saw CB Red when guys wanted to smell nice to work out.
You think I'm kidding? I'm not.
Excuse me?
What's going on here?
The old guy croaked.
Breuil?
Let's just say that if there was one less Breuil in the world, I was in.
But don't forget, the Breuils always win.
At my age, having done nothing to deserve it,
little Patrick became the big boss.
His future was all mapped out, while I didn't have one.
Even so, that's when everything changed for me.
Hello. Béatrice Breuil, Patrick's wife.
A gift to celebrate his taking over as head of the company.
A Bois d'Argent fragrance.
-Hello. -Hi.
-A little gift from our family. -Thanks.
What about you, Daniel?
How's it going with the perfumers? Is the son any better than the father?
Not sure.
They're really taking it out of you.
Yeah. They wear us out.
Guess what your mom and I heard on the local news last night?
A few liters of perfume concentrate can go for the same price as a kilo of gold.
Fuck. At that price, you'd better smell good.
A bit of water with some kind of dumb flower juice… 30,000 smackers.
Those guys think they're so fancy.
YOUR SALE PRICE - 50 €
INTERESTED IN THE COLIN BROWN!
Scania, I've been watching them for days, I'm telling you.
There's only one time when the boxes don't ring at the gate.
There's piles of money to be made.
Enough with that bullshit.
I sold one bottle online. I made 50 euros in one second.
Why would we miss out on a gold mine like that?
Tell me. What do we have to lose here? I'm doing it, so do it.
What are you doing about Kowalski?
That Polack's the one who's gonna let us into the chicken coop.
-I know how to handle him. -You're killing me.
I'm throwing pearls before swine with you.
Evening, Patrick.
Jacques-Yves. I'm pleased you could come.
He'd have been touched.
You should be proud. Armand was a front-runner to the end.
Thanks, Jacques-Yves.
None of that between us, now that we'll be seeing more of each other.
-How so? -I'll swing by from time to time.
To see that our products are still getting the same treatment.
I'd like to introduce you to Béatrice.
Béa.
My wife, Béatrice. Jacques-Yves Rousseau from Colin Brown.
Nice to meet you.
-My pleasure. -And…
Brice Nougarolis, Parfums VIP.
Yes, the online discounter. We know who you are.
Boss! One of your Polacks ran over one of my boxes with his Fenwick.
-Polack? -Yeah.
Hold on.
-"One of my Polacks"? -Yeah.
You know what, Sauveur?
From now on, it won't be my Polacks taking care of the trash.
It's going to be you, my little French helper.
You can start right now. Get rid of this.
As David Douillet would say, stupidity is like judo.
Dick.
You need to use your opponent's strength.
-Sauveur? -Yeah.
He's a dick, boss.
Hello. I'm going to the incinerator.
-Go ahead. -Thanks.
Take people who work in offices.
They take pens home for their kids to have something to draw with.
You don't have a problem with that, right?
Scania and I work in perfume, and we don't have kids.
Same thing.
In six months, we made 10,000 smackers each by selling online.
I was able to help out Unc and Mom. And Scania bought me a rollie.
Enjoying life?
Hey!
Go fuck yourself.
May I buy you a drink?
Yeah? Hey! A couple of mojitos!
-Two? Got it. -Thanks.
I'm a regular here.
How come I've never seen that lovely face before?
I just moved back to Chartres.
Yeah?
People usually tend to leave.
What brought you back?
-Work. -Perfume?
Like everyone.
-Like me. -Oh yeah?
-Yeah. -For whom?
For whom? For myself. I launched a small start-up.
I'm selling luxury brands at a discount.
For now. Down the line, who knows.
Growth is good for now. Exponential, you could say.
At the beginning, we were more into B2B licensing,
wanting to move into B2C, so we went with the US straightaway.
Then we thought, in the medium term, why not totally flood the metaverse,
directly on the Internet, too,
in the peripheral, secondary universes.
And so now we're trying to…
You've got to take a break, too, you know. We're having a few parties with friends.
To blow off some steam, you know.
Because we've just taken three million, me and my friend over there.
He's a mediocre dancer,
but he's bought himself a nice little shack for 1.5 million
on the Opal Coast.
He bought it with cash, just like that.
And there's a whole group of us in the incubator.
Kind of like modern-day "golden boys," without the guns.
We said to ourselves, "We might go crazy."
That's the risk, so we'd better not. So, what do you think?
-What do you think? -About?
How about we go for dinner at the Beaux Arts? Monday at 8:00 p.m.?
No.
-8:30? -Thanks.
8:30? A little later?
Hey!
Amigo, is that a Rorolove you have there? Let me see.
My mother gave it to me for my birthday.
-Give it or you're out. -No, boss.
Your contract is up for renewal. You're two days late. My 500 smackers?
I'll pay you tomorrow.
I don't do credit.
There you go. Perfect.
I wouldn't have wanted to put someone else on trash duty.
Trash really suits you.
Go on, move it.
Son of a bitch.
COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS
What?
USERS HAVE REPORTED THE SALE OF COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS
Bastards.
Daniel?
Fuck.
Daniel?
Yeah?
-Come down! -Yeah!
Lt. Fayard, national police. We were called in by the customs service.
Customs?
You must be mistaken. I've never crossed a border in my life.
I think you must have the wrong address.
Do you have a computer?
No.
What's your job, Daniel?
I work on the Breuil assembly line.
Breuil?
Doesn't mean a thing. The whole town works in perfume, so it's not…
Who mentioned perfume?
You asked whether I worked for Breuil. We make perfume, so I said "perfume."
Does lebonplan.fr mean anything to you?
Is that why you're… Okay. So, it's very…
So Breuil Jr. took over the company.
His wife, very kindly, gave a bottle to all the employees.
And because I don't use that scent,
I thought I'd sell it online.
So I sold it for 50 euros.
It's true that I told my friends about it.
And so everyone wanted me to sell theirs.
But it was really temporary.
I mean, I wasn't planning to have a business, you know.
That might be why you saw multiple sales.
-Online? -Online, yeah.
Without a computer?
Without… Yeah. Someone lent one to me just for that.
-We've never had one. -Yeah.
Actually, it'd be useful to get one to buy stuff.
Fencing counterfeit goods gets you five years.
And a 375,000 euro fine.
I'll stay in line.
I can't call you. The cops put a tap on my phone.
What are you talking about?
They searched the house.
They know about the Internet deal. It's over.
What do I do with the 200 bottles I have?
I don't know. I'll figure it out.
We need to make some money. I need to leave Mom's place.
I'm not going to get her involved in our mess.
It's Kowalski.
Go.
Come in.
I don't have you on my calendar, Mr. Sauveur.
You know my name? Did you look for it?
I'm the head of HR. Really? Right.
-Take a seat. -Yes, thanks.
Weird that we haven't run into each other in the halls before.
So, where were you before?
I was with Breuil in the Paris office.
Then Mr. Breuil called me in as general manager.
Right, GM, okay.
-Congratulations. -Thanks.
Did you end up going with that other guy?
-Let's not discuss that. -No?
-No. -No.
Anything else?
No, I just came to set things straight.
No need.
Just for me, just to tell you that this whole Internet thing…
I'd been drinking, so I was talking nonsense.
I don't even own a computer, so it's…
It didn't make any sense. It was totally ridiculous.
So I wanted to apologize.
Drinking makes people exaggerate.
-Do you see… -Not really.
I have a meeting in five minutes. You've set things straight, so that's it.
We'll have an opportunity to discuss your personal development.
Got it, madam.
Just one last little thing.
About the dinner, are we still on?
No.
-No? -No.
-I don't mix business and personal. -Is it because I'm a warehouse worker?
I never said that.
It's just a bit hurtful. But, hey, you get used to it.
-I'll pick you up at 8:00 p.m., babe? -What are you doing?
-Have dinner with me. -Are you crazy?
A quick meal. What's the harm?
We'll see, but not here.
-We'll see? -Get out.
-"We'll see" means "we'll see." -Leave.
You didn't eat them last time. They got left in the fridge.
Hello.
Ladies and gents, all the Apple products!
iPhone, iPad, all the best Apple packages, get them here!
We've got luxury watches and glasses, sir!
Thirty euros. It's not expensive. They're quality.
It's French. A luxury product.
The latest iPhone, get it here!
-For 350 euros, it's yours, my friend. -Is it real, at least?
It's 350 euros.
I only have 300.
Give me the 300. That's great. All right.
Have a good day. It's not expensive!
Sir, this is the real thing.
All the Apple products!
-I'm going to the truck. -iPad! iPhone!
Get them here! Sir, anything you like?
-Trying to screw us over? -Not the teeth!
-Who are you, you little bastard? -Stop! Stop!
Tell me when it's 30. You tell me when to start counting!
The asshole's getting away!
Guys, stop! I have 200 perfumes worth 100 euros!
Sell them for 50. You'll make 5,000 in a weekend!
You think I believe you?
They're luxury products, guys! Colin Brown, come on!
-Why didn't you say? -Why didn't you talk to us at the stall?
-I didn't dare. -Come on, get up. What nonsense.
That's how I replaced the Internet with Titou and Raoul.
You have to admit, there's nothing better than buying local.
Right.
Let's say 50% at the end of every month.
Boss, it's our first time doing this.
-First time. -Yes.
You take 15 units ten times a week.
600 units per month at 60 euros apiece.
That means my cut is 18,000.
We don't sell for 60 euros a unit, boss.
You're a real asshole, Sauveur.
Right?
What are you doing?
Tomorrow.
Fuck, tomorrow.
Don't worry.
-Who is this? -It's us.
He's coming out for the money.
Come in. Not outside.
I didn't think losers like you were the type to save.
-Asshole. -Come here!
Hold on! Daniel!
Relax! Stop.
Damn it, it's broken.
-I'm going to send you to jail. -Shut up.
Scania's cousin works for Social Security.
He loved your short-term contract deal. Here, call him.
-Yes. -We'll explain it all to him.
You're going to tell him that it's not right.
-Here. -Okay, I get it.
-You got it? -Yes.
Here's a six-month disability claim. I'll take this back.
It was mine. Let's not argue over it.
There.
You keep your mouth shut. We'll keep business running, okay?
Jesus.
In the time it took Breuil to replace Kowalski, we had an open playing field.
We increased our numbers
to the point that my guys at the market…
Get a Kangoo! What's this thing?
…they struggled to keep up.
As for me, I finally got to leave my mom's place
and rent my own house in Croix-Bonnard
where the Cosmetic Valley executives live.
Do you like it, Mr. Sauveur? The appliances are new.
-Is it all in good order? -Everything is perfect.
-Perfect. -Is the file okay?
-Great. -Enjoy your well-deserved holiday.
You'll be comfy here, right?
To Breuil.
So, with this robotic inventory system,
robots scan all the boxes but not their contents?
That's right, Miss Van Stratten.
Some of the products won't be monitored. 1.1% across the entire stock.
-Marginal. -Marginal?
1.1% is a lot of products with the massive numbers we handle.
If we want to stay in the race,
or even, let's go crazy,
if we want to win this race, we have to move more products more quickly.
So I'm the only one here who sees
that 1.1% of the 4.5 million perfumes we handle a year
represents over 2 million euros worth of perfume that's unmonitored.
Or you're the only one who doesn't see that we're monitoring 200 million euros.
Stéphane is right. Innovation has always been part of the company's DNA.
It's a green light from me. Thank you, everyone.
Thanks, Patrick.
Are you getting settled?
I gave the green light to a project to digitalize the inventory.
It should allow us to grow.
But, yeah…
I've wanted to ask you something, but I was waiting for…
For what?
I've always known that you weren't made for taking over Breuil.
That your father was pushing it a bit.
What's your question?
The other day at the Beaux Arts, Brice Nougarolis put an idea in my head.
Nougarolis?
What the hell was he doing there?
He's a perfume discounter. Everything Dad hated.
The biggest online retailer in Europe.
-You want me to go online. Is that it? -I'm being serious.
So what, then?
He said that he'd give everything to be in your shoes,
at the helm of a big cruise liner, something stupid like that.
I'm not following. What's this about?
I think Nougarolis would buy Breuil.
Dad and Grandad's company?
Your father is dead. Your grandad for even longer.
You want to sell and then do what?
Whatever we want.
Your dad always got in the way of your plans.
But that's over now. So sell.
Don't you see? This is what we need.
A fresh start.
You mean the three of us?
Are you talking about kids?
-Everything is copied there? -Right.
-Hello, Sauveur. -Hi.
-How are you? -What's going on here?
I have some good news.
Your job is going to be taken over by a foolproof scanner
that won't get tired of watching the products.
I don't get tired. I'm fulfilled.
I said it at the last meeting. I don't want to change roles.
It's always the same with your lot. You complain before you understand.
Kowalski is on disability.
So you'll get the assistant role.
You'll support Lablonde, who will replace him in stock management.
You're getting promoted.
I don't want it. HR didn't even warn me. Is this mandatory?
It was agreed at the top.
-Breuil? -Yes, Patrick.
-Fucking Breuil. -What did you say?
The French economy has created over 100,000 jobs. Good news.
-Where are you going? -To the incinerator. The dumpster's full.
Sit down.
Why?
You're the assistant, Sauveur. The trash is for the warehouse workers.
I'm not gonna wait for a bedsore from sitting on my ass.
-I don't mind helping out a bit. -Well, I do mind.
-Do you know about collective agreements? -Yeah.
It's not just your right to sit on your ass. It's your duty.
You know how many guys have seen the wrong end of a cop's baton
just for your ass?
Don't mess things up for us, okay?
Sit down!
…there's also an issue with a fear of recruiting…
I left my life behind to go to Paris for training
because you asked me to.
You bring me back, then give the job you promised me to a moron.
Stéphane isn't a moron.
He has qualifications.
Five years at private-sales.com.
Working with him is a way for you to increase your skill set.
-Increase my skill set? -Virginie.
It's a management decision.
You want to talk about management?
I'm going to ask you a question that I was given during the training.
Focus.
In your company, who do you fire first?
The smart person who works hard, the smart person who doesn't,
the idiot who works hard, or the idiot who doesn't?
It's the idiot who works hard. He does the most damage.
Now, imagine that in this company,
the idiot's the person with all the power.
Are we talking about Stéphane?
Sauveur, where are you going?
Fuck, how do they do it?
TONIGHT?
PACKAGING AWARDS BREUIL & SONS
That's her, with Gégé.
Your sweetheart is drunk as a skunk.
Don't say that when you come over.
Okay, you got it? You got the champagne?
I'm heading over.
Good evening.
Evening.
You couldn't resist.
Coming here.
How are you?
I'm great.
He appointed a business school graduate. A business school graduate?
I didn't see it coming. I'm so dumb. Even though I did everything right.
I believe people when they make promises, but people don't care about promises.
And then you're the fool. Like me.
I don't really understand. It's confusing. What's your point? I don't get it.
I told you Breuil made me come back for the role of general manager.
-Yes, right. -There you go.
Well, Breuil decided to give the general manager role to someone else.
Right. Because what's Breuil? He's an asshole.
The Breuils are bastards.
-No, okay. -I'm really…
Please, let's talk outside.
I'm sorry.
That wasn't exactly a great first date.
Second.
The first wasn't a raging success either.
What?
Wanna get your revenge on the Breuils?
I wouldn't know how.
But if you could?
Honestly?
Yes.
Can I kiss you?
What's the connection?
The connection is that I'm about to take a big risk for you.
I told her everything. Don't ask me why. I just knew I had to.
A champion's instinct.
Wait, just…
Those barcode readers that scan the boxes?
How do they scan the bottles that are inside them?
The robots scan the container.
-What's the container? -Well, the boxes.
They don't count the bottles? That's dumb.
It's dumb, but it's fast. That's all Breuil cares about.
This is a pallet of 27 boxes.
Listen.
When we prepare an order, we take a whole box,
or we pick stuff out of a box at the top of the pallet.
Since we only scan the box, the system tolerates a margin of error.
It doesn't know how many bottles there are.
That margin of error is 1.1%
There. Listen to this. It's genius.
If we take less than 1.1% of the entire stock,
the system won't register an error and won't set off a warning.
And 1.1% equals millions, just waiting for us to take.
2.5 million, to be precise, which is 50,000 bottles.
-We can't take 50,000 bottles. -Why not?
50,000 bottles. That's actual theft, son.
50,000 bottles is nothing to Breuil.
We won't get caught. Give me the notepad.
We just need to find ten people. Build a team.
Ten people? How? I'm your only friend in the place.
To bring people into this, you need to know them a bit.
Scania, Virginie's job is to recruit people.
It's not her job to recruit people to steal from their boss.
Would lots of people refuse an extra month's salary
handed to them on a platter?
An extra salary every month.
Remember that our dream was always to make the Breuils pay.
With this, they'll lose 2.5 million euros.
It'd be criminal not to take them for every last cent.
Okay, maybe.
We need to convince ten people.
-Okay, that's good. -Yeah.
They're good. We can trust them.
We're not taking him. We're not taking Lablonde.
There's no way.
We have to take him.
Virginie taught me something.
Out of the 26 million workers in France, 800,000 are Buddhists.
That's nothing, right?
No one has ever heard of Buddhists.
Well, actually, there are twice as many of them
as the 400,000 union workers who bust our balls all year round,
which tells you what a nuisance they could be.
If the Breuil union had the bad idea of hitting us with a week-long strike,
we'd get nothing out and lose even more dough than Breuil.
She was right. We needed Lablonde. He was the union rep at the company.
Like they say in Japan, "Rain falls harder on a leaky roof."
So my business had to run like clockwork.
I found that the trick was to slip a duplicate of a big order
into the pile of orders to be prepared.
That one there.
If we were caught, it could be blamed on a small printing error.
Could happen to anyone.
Mr. Lablonde!
We had to have guys at every step of the pallet being processed.
First, Lablonde decides which team prepares what order.
That's Annie Boss, supervisor.
She makes sure the list gets into the right hands.
Franck Schumi, the Schumacher of forklift drivers.
I timed each of them ten times. He's the fastest.
He's in charge of lowering the top pallets,
the ones we never dip into.
There. You see how everything is automated.
With our friends.
The Seko twins.
Fabrice and Fabien. Known for their flexibility.
Their job is to take stuff from the bottom of the pallet
to delay, for as long as possible,
the discovery that products are missing from the stock.
It's very easy for the surveillance team to notice
if two identical big orders are being prepared at the same time.
It never happens, so that'd sound the alarm.
It's difficult to buy the security guards.
A private company changes them each week.
But watch Yasmina and Déborah.
Yasmina goes down the list of products from A to Z.
Déborah goes up the list from Z to A.
The guys on video don't get it.
Me neither. That must mean it's working.
See the A4 sheet that Mickaël is slipping between two boxes there?
Truckers and dockers aren't allowed inside the warehouse.
We use that sign
to follow the pallet that needs to be diverted after the gate.
Okay, let's watch.
Watch.
It's going to turn now. There.
-All done. -There you go.
There it is. 27 boxes of 72 bottles. I'll let you do the math.
-Lablonde validates the dispatch. -Okay.
Mourad, our docker, just has to divert it to the right truck.
I'll take that one in.
And our driver,
you already know him.
If you're no math wizard, we lifted two pallets of 1,944 bottles a week.
we lifted two pallets of 1,944 bottles a week.
On the market, that's 388,000 in cash every month.
Wanna come by tonight?
I'm not good at meeting people.
Isn't that the essence of your job?
It's not the same thing.
What? You can't handle it?
-Don't push, Sauveur. -What?
I'm in as deep as you are. I'm just cautious.
-We don't know where all this will lead. -We do.
We're going to rip two million off Breuil Jr.
I'm not talking about that. After.
After…
After that, we'll take our money. We'll leave this town, and we'll see.
You know nothing about me.
I know enough.
You think I'd leave it all behind for a warehouse worker?
Yes.
No?
Yes.
Okay.
They'll be waiting for me.
If by chance you want to set up a business like mine,
just a word of advice. Take space into account.
I can guarantee that two pallets per week take up a whole lot of space.
And one last thing. Make sure to keep an eye on your team.
Don't forget. The worst rich person is the one who used to be poor.
From the first payday, every team member opened the bullshit floodgates.
And I mean big-time.
Schumi wanted to have cooking lessons with the chef at Beaux Arts.
Hi, Daniel.
A Michelin-star chef charges 300 smackers an hour.
Have you heard about cryptocurrency? It's billions, Schumi.
Gotta get those assholes.
As for Lablonde, the pinko of cosmetics,
his vice was horse racing bets.
You good, Daniel? Please don't give me all 200 euro bills this time. Okay?
That fool blew all his money at the bookies
on tips sent his way by his union buddies.
They don't like it at the coffee shop.
And every night, Mickaël bought rounds at the Pharaoh with his dear cousin Yoni
who came up with the brilliant idea of showing up at Breuil in a brand-new Audi.
They're friends. They're leaving in five minutes.
There was one thing that made me lose my shit.
I won't post them.
Yasmina and Déborah's stories about their shopping spree on Avenue Montaigne.
This time, I decided to take things in hand and buy my neighbor's house.
Here's Santa Claus. I need some dough.
Refuel coming up. One sec.
They could blow as much as they wanted. Nothing was leaving this place.
Why would they buy all that shit?
Bunch of fools.
Every Friday, Scania and I paid everyone.
So, how full is that thing? Those idiots are costing me.
-And every Friday, it'd get messy. -Close it.
Come on! Give me mine!
This is great!
Fifty euros, ladies and gentlemen!
Because she's lovely.
Good, thanks.
-Both? -Both.
Not interested?
Both for 50 euros.
Quality perfume at a low price! Fifty euros!
No, there! Damn it! Every time!
Two for forty euros. Okay, give it to me.
Cheers.
Hello?
We do what we can, Daniel.
But you're pushing too much. We can't take it.
Tuesday, Moulins. Wednesday, Mâcon.
Thursday, Montbéliard. Friday, Montargis. Saturday, Montviers.
What do we do, bro?
You've done the towns starting with M. Do the cities starting with N!
We were reaching our limit. But that didn't bother anyone.
They only cared about their Friday night fiesta.
There was only one thing on my mind. Finding a way to grow bigger and bigger.
You know what? It was handed to me.
Jesus.
The magical child.
Jesus was Yasmina's half brother, and his guilty pleasure was orgies.
During his adventures,
he'd made friends with two directors of the Bergamini store,
the Italian Sephora that just came to France.
…in cash, every month.
He even talked them into doing business with me.
So we had to have structure.
The first problem I had was storage.
Whenever I have a problem, Scania has a cousin.
-How are you? -Hi.
He was a dairy farmer and broke as they come.
You good?
He'd had enough of eating what he could hunt,
so he jumped at the chance to rent out his barn.
-So? -Perfect.
Other than Scania and I, no one knew where the stock was.
It was better that way.
All we needed was our own truck to deliver to Bergamini, so I broke my piggy bank.
It's the least expensive one. Come.
Shut up!
With my small company, I sold all my stock to Bergamini like any other local company.
I sold them 20% cheaper than Breuil.
Apparently, Tapie said, "The first million is the hardest."
Well, I can tell you, not for us.
Drink!
The real France of tax-free overtime. That was us.
I mean, who would want something like that to end?
Béa?
Béa.
What?
-We have a huge problem. -What's wrong?
After signing the agreement in principle with Nougarolis…
I called you, remember?
-It's me. -So?
They just left.
Is it fully signed?
Just a few formalities. Accounts audit, stock inventory by his auditors.
The sale will be complete in a month's time.
And? It was all going well. What happened after that?
Once I had left, I heard a loud noise from the warehouse.
What noise?
We had a metal sheet come off the roof a few months back.
Yes, you mentioned there were leaks.
Leaks in the warehouse.
So with all that water, he wanted to go take a look.
And he found them.
He opened 20 boxes at random. All empty.
Why didn't you call the cops right away?
Well, Béa, because I'd just signed a binding agreement with Nougarolis.
If he hears about all this before I find the missing stock,
we're fucked.
You know what that means?
After the stock inventory, I'll be able to buy Breuil at half price.
Empty shelves sell at a lot less than full shelves, even if it's perfume.
What do you think?
I get myself a job at Breuil as an ex-con reentering the job market.
That always attracts the thugs. I identify the thieves. I infiltrate them.
I report back on the missing stock.
Nothing complicated.
Great.
You won't reveal your source? It's your business.
But did they give you any details that might have drawn your attention?
Bearing in mind your deadline, it could save us time.
There is something, now that I think about it.
Two, three weeks ago, Patrick came home all upset
because an employee took his spot in the parking lot.
It wasn't the poor guy's fault.
I took down the "Reserved for Armand Breuil" sign when he died.
-Two minutes. I'll get him. -Well…
"Two minutes…" You mean, one minute.
The odd thing is that it was a young warehouse worker with a luxury car.
An Audi TT, I think.
Sorry, boss. There's no sign, so I thought…
-I didn't want it to get scratched. -Yes.
An Audi TT.
That's more than enough.
On the face of it, we should get this done in under a week.
That's what I wanted to hear.
From now on, call me Ange.
-You good? Yeah. -All right?
-What are you eating? -Where have you been, looking like a mess?
Daniel's been looking for you.
Are you listening to me?
You can't just show up here at lunchtime every day.
Daniel's going to replace you. You hear, Yoni?
Screw Daniel.
Yeah?
Hey. You're screwing all of us.
Because of you, we couldn't get it out today.
We'll only get half our money on Friday. What's your excuse?
I'm in love.
-I'm going, or I'll punch him. -It's no big deal.
You dumb or what?
What's your dad's problem? He gets on my nerves.
-Did you hear what you said to him? -It's 8:00 a.m.
"8:00 a.m."? It's noon.
Have the clocks changed?
-Who's the girl? -The girl from the checkroom.
-At Pharaoh's? -Yeah.
-Isn't that the bouncer's girl? -Not between 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.
-He's going to destroy you. -I can handle myself.
I'd like to see that.
-She's hot though. -Don't talk about my girl. It's serious.
-You bastard! -Bruce!
-It wasn't me! -Leave him!
-Hey, what are you doing? -Bruce, let him go!
You piece of shit! Asshole!
-Don't kill me! -Stop!
-Hey! Let me go! -Stop!
-Stop! I'm begging you! Bruce! -Let me go, asshole!
Fuck. What is that ex-con doing there?
Hey!
What are you doing?
I don't know, boss. I was told to fill--
You weren't told anything. Go see Lablonde.
He'll move you. Get this done.
What's with your cousin? He's ditched me twice this week.
It's serious this time. He's in the hospital.
-Two months on disability. -No way. What did you do?
We went out to the Pharaoh. He got beaten up by some guy.
You messing with me? Do you know what's at stake?
-I know. I'm sorry, but-- -Shut up.
We have a pallet to get out. How are you going to manage on your own?
-I don't know. -Yeah, well…
Tell Yoni to stay tucked in bed.
-He's fired. You tell him. -Daniel…
Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second?
Tell me. What were you in prison for?
-Armored vehicle. -Armored vehicle?
Okay. Were you armed?
-It's easier than using bare hands. -Right.
Did you shoot?
AK47, it's enough to just show it.
And how many years did you get?
Eight. Four on probation.
You snitched?
Good behavior.
Would you like to make an easy 500 smackers?
-Forget it. I'm not interested. -I mean it. No risk. It's really clean.
You'll have your 500 smackers at 2:00 p.m. It's fine.
You interested?
Go see Mickaël over there, next to the wrapper. He'll explain.
That's what you came up with?
-To hire an ex-con. -You could've discussed it with us.
As long as he does the job, I'm fine. Is he doing the job, Mickaël?
He's doing good.
Fine, but what if he tries to look good and tells his PO?
-His what? -His PO.
Probation officer. What if he turns us in?
Actually, he's involved now. He has more to lose than we do.
If there's an issue, he'll get sent back to jail. No risk for us.
That's all nice, but how are you going to pay him?
He's getting Yoni's share. After that, we'll see.
That's not right.
Not right? Weren't you in charge of your nephew?
Hold on. You're paying him as much as us? Seniority doesn't count?
You're constantly plugged into the news. It's frying your brain.
Is this the negotiating table at an industrial relations meeting?
Listen. That ex-con is a risk that involves all of us.
-True. -Right.
I say we take a vote. I vote against.
-Same. -There's been a misunderstanding. No vote.
Okay? So you schedule him with Mickaël, and that's it.
Save your saliva for your wife.
What I'm about to tell you is extremely serious.
I found out we're being robbed.
-Here? -Products. A lot of them.
It's probably happening as we speak.
No way. We have the best security system in the valley.
There's no doubt about it.
It has to be one of our employees. No one knows them better than you.
I want you to analyze the HR database to look for suspect profiles.
-Even old employees. -Of course.
I promise that if we get through this together,
this time, I won't forget you.
-In a nutshell? -He knows everything.
No. He asked you to find out. That's not the same at all.
Semantics. He won't let it go.
Breuil Jr. won't let anything go?
You're laughing, but I see him every day.
-Yeah. -So, what do I tell him?
You know it can't be traced.
Every pallet we take goes through the normal workflow.
So, if at any point there's an error,
it's an order that was duplicated, and that's all.
An error. You just need to rationalize it.
-Rationalize? -Yeah.
But we're in deep shit with Breuil! Do you get that?
Aren't you being overdramatic?
It's a matter of time before he finds out everything.
We're lucky enough to have a heads-up. Shouldn't we cool things down?
Not yet.
What I found out last night is big. Very big.
Give me names and addresses.
I've got a good lead, but I need more time before I can give you a full report.
Didn't we say under a week?
I haven't found the stock yet.
I'm not saying we won't, but this isn't a small team.
That's your problem. Mine is to get my money's worth.
Mr. Nougarolis, I don't earn my living with my fees, but with the bonus I get.
The tally is at 5,000 a week. That bonus thing isn't funny.
If you prefer, we can call it a day.
You wanna play it like that? With me?
You're not very smart for a sleuth.
You tell me people are stealing? That the audit will confirm it?
That's enough for me to make Breuil bleed. I don't need your shitty report.
You know what we're going to do? Let's call it a day.
I'll work things out with my contact. We're done.
That's how it is?
Yes, that's how it is.
I'm not following.
You wanted to move fast. Now you want to put the sale off for six months?
You're going to shed staff when you merge Breuil & Sons with Nougarolis.
These people have worked for us forever.
I'd like to find new jobs for as many people as possible.
One less job for you.
Redundancy schemes are always a drag.
You know that one?
Who would you fire first?
-The smart guy who works-- -The idiot who works hard.
I need six months.
Espresso?
You know, since I was a kid, I've picked up on people's energy.
It's a kind of gift that I was given.
I see a lot of suffering in you. Too much emotion.
You need to free yourself from that as soon as possible.
So we're not changing the deal.
KP2M will come take a stock inventory by the end of the month,
and we will close the sale as agreed.
Breuil's freaking out. He's increasing security.
It's all you ever talk about.
Of course. There are ten security guards arriving next week.
We'll adapt. What's the big deal?
Are you dumb? Breuil knows how much was stolen.
If there's one snitch, you'll all go to prison.
Did you say "you"? -What do you mean? -Why didn't you say "we"?
-What do you mean? -Why didn't you say "we"? -You made a deal with Breuil? -Stop right there.
-You made a deal with Breuil? -Stop right there.
You should tell them.
They'll freak out over nothing. Leave them out of my business.
-Your business? -Yeah.
You're not doing business, Daniel.
You're a small-time thief that steals a lot.
I'm not going back to being a pallet-pusher for Breuil.
It's my way out. Maybe it's a bit fun for you--
"Fun"? You have no idea what I've had to do to get here.
For me, it's simple. It stops here. You should do the same.
If not for me, you'd still be selling a few perfumes at the market.
You need to listen.
What do I owe you? Go on, tell me what I owe you.
You're right. You owe me nothing. We don't owe each other anything.
Your letting go says something about the kind of person you are.
You're so desperate to fit in that mold, your business guys have restricted you.
You've forgotten what really matters in life.
What's that? Money?
No, flair.
That fucking idiot.
-Hello? -Mr. Breuil?
I know who's stealing from you.
Mr. Breuil? Are you still there?
Yes.
Like I said, I know who's stealing from you.
I know that you've had a lot go missing.
I also know how that could compromise the sale of your business.
I can help you.
-That's my job. -I need the stock.
I absolutely need to find my stock and put it back.
I'm working on it.
I can get you out of this in good shape if you're willing to pay the price.
Pay 50,000 up front and 50,000 when I deliver the report.
It's not much compared to what's at stake.
Mr. Breuil?
I heard you.
It's essential that you don't talk to anyone about this.
Who am I going to talk to?
OPEN THE RECEIVED FILE
I'm sorry, Mr. Breuil.
Now, listen carefully to what I'm about to say.
I'M SORRY, PLEASE CALL ME VIRGINIE?
Hello?
Breuil knows.
-What? -Is this a joke, Daniel?
-How is that possible? -Fuck, no way.
The good thing is, he doesn't know it's us.
But I hope you've set a little aside because the source has run dry.
-No. -No.
Well, I have a solution for you, but it means going bigger.
What does that mean?
Lablonde, can you confirm
that we have 38 tons going to Sephora Paris Rivoli this weekend?
No, well, I don't know…
-Yes or no? -I don't have the calendar!
Right, okay. I prepared the orders for Mother's Day.
Two of the trucks are loaded up to the max. 40,000 units each.
I suggest we make them disappear.
What?
-What? -That's real theft.
I'm in!
What if they trace it back to us?
They won't trace it back
because they'll think that the trucks were held up
by a team of professionals.
What? Who's going to do that? Because--
We are.
-You're mad. -Hold on.
A truck is just a big van, right?
Your specialty, Ange.
The 80,000 units will be in storage before being sold off.
It's worth 2.5 million.
And we'll split it evenly.
We have two days to get ready.
Who's in?
Now we get a vote?
Shut up, you.
Well, 200,000…
-Get down! -Don't shoot!
-I don't want to die! -Shut up!
No! Yes, sir.
No!
Give me your hands. I said shut the fuck up!
-Shut up! -Stop. Hold it.
-Never drop your weapon. -But how do I get the thing on?
Never put down your weapon or you're dead!
Is that clear?
Can I have a go?
What? You?
Really?
-Face down! -Are you mad?
-Hands behind your back. Shut up! -It hurt!
-It's a practice run. -Behind your back! Shut up!
Asshole. Shut up!
There. That's how it's done!
She was holding the zip ties, and she kept the gun on Mourad.
-Okay! Well done. -Well done, Boss!
-Wanna try the truck again? -No, it's fine.
Just one thing, guys.
Don't forget that the second driver won't be in on it. Okay?
Same thing for the gas station staff at Lionville. Okay?
I want us to be believable. They'll eventually be witnesses.
It's planned for Friday night. The Total gas station at Lionville.
-Well done. -Your stock must be close by.
Very good.
Thanks, Jacques-Yves.
Good night.
Same to you.
Sephora Rivoli.
Sephora Rivoli.
Coffee?
Okay, it's Mourad.
Let's go!
Hey!
They're off.
Drop that, damn it!
-I swear I didn't do anything! -Get down!
Get out!
-Get out! -Move!
Get out!
Shut up! Give me your hands!
Don't shoot! I have kids, please!
Shut your mouth!
The door!
Come on!
Let's go!
Where's Ange?
I thought he was with you.
Okay, forget it! Let's go! To the quarry!
-Have you located my stock? -Not yet, but I'm close.
-Where are you? -In one of your trucks.
Thing is, my price has changed. I'm taking too many risks.
No pay without proof.
Another three and we're good.
-Are we on schedule? -We should get going.
It's sad to have to leave two brand-new trucks behind.
-Find yourself a woman, bro. -What's the connection?
-Fuck. -What's wrong?
-I'm not getting through to Boss. -They must be at the quarry.
They'll call us from the road.
UNDELIVERED
Shit!
Where is that dog?
Motherfucker. He used the hedgehog trap, look.
-The dog! -Fuck! Look!
Fuck.
Damn it.
The son of a bitch asked Breuil for 200,000 euros to turn us in.
Monday at 7:45 a.m.,
hair combed to the right, tortoiseshell glasses, and Hermès ties,
Nougarolis's auditors arrived.
Okay. Shall we start?
Étienne, summary.
In line with KP2M protocols,
we cross-checked the data on the company software
with the physical stock inventory.
This was carried out by taking samples from 320 boxes.
-What did that give us in the end? -We get…
Unlike Nougarolis, I was born in Chartres.
And unlike him, I learned this at birth.
The inventory confirms the quantities declared by the seller
at the signing of the agreement in principle.
-Nothing's missing? -It's marginal, sir.
The Breuils always win.
Brice.
You want to know how little Patrick saved his skin?
Remember that night?
-Hello? -Sauveur.
We need to meet. The cathedral. Now.
TO ARMAND BREUIL FROM THE GRATEFUL TOWN OF CHARTRES
You know we went to school together?
-At Jean Moulin. -Doesn't ring a bell.
I remember you well.
What do you want?
I bought some information from your team…
I have your names. Pictures of your house.
…with the hundreds of thousands of euros in cash
which you're giving back to me.
Why didn't you call the police?
Because I'm selling.
When?
We already signed. That's the issue.
There's too much perfume missing for the audit to go the way it needs to go.
I want all the products that you stole to find their way back to my warehouse.
Immediately.
That's going to be tricky. I sold it all.
I'd have preferred to avoid this.
Here's little Patrick's plan B.
To avoid prison,
I had to fill two trucks with an amount equal to the missing stock.
I stole them, as you know. The insurance covered it.
We then replaced the stolen boxes in the inventory.
The auditors wouldn't notice shit,
and Nougarolis, who thought he was going to pay Breuil half,
would have to pay full price.
It's that or the police.
Except that in this story, we did all the work and made shit. As usual.
And for me, that doesn't work anymore. So let's follow my plan instead.
Admire the artist.
Wait, your story isn't clear.
I'll do your robbery.
But only if you tell me everything. Don't hide anything.
My wife.
She talked me into selling. And into selling to Nougarolis.
They are…
close.
So you want to hurt them.
Okay.
I'll do the robbery, but whatever I steal is mine.
You don't get it, Sauveur.
All my products come back to me.
Calm down, man.
Imagine
if people realized that the products prepared by Breuil for Colin Brown
don't contain perfume.
What would happen?
It would be a huge scandal.
We agree that Breuil & Sons can't afford that kind of setback.
It'd be a lot more than a setback.
All our clients would terminate their distribution contracts.
It would finish us.
Us? You mean Nougarolis?
-What is this shit? -It's water.
Nougarolis.
Listen to me, boss.
We'll do the robbery. Then we sabotage the perfume stock.
This is how it'll happen.
The day after the robbery, I'll offload all the stolen goods
into the professional sector.
They'll quickly sell it through the black market.
Look at that dick.
You'll take care of getting the insurance in place.
They're pros.
Play it smart. They have to believe you.
They must be from the Paris suburbs.
If they get into perfume now, we're in deep shit.
Don't worry. We have a solid case. It'll be approved.
Thank you. I'm counting on you.
And after that, we'll meet at Breuil's to make our own recipe for Gold.
You have thousands of empty bottles waiting to be filled by your machines.
I have the perfect team for implementing this gigantic plan.
Without them, it'd be impossible to pack everything up into boxes and pallets
in just one night.
Let's go, guys!
And once we've stuffed your stock with thousands of liters of water,
I can tell you that we'll give Nougarolis a good cleansing.
One last thing before we agree on this.
You'll help get the bastard that betrayed me.
-Yeah? -I got your message. Where is he?
He was in the back of a truck on the way to your barn.
That motherfucker. We're not there anymore. I'll head back.
Look at that son of a bitch. Go on.
Fuck!
SAUVEUR, A COSMETIC VALLEY NEWCOMER
Did you have that put there?
It's not like I didn't owe him anything. That's true.
I came to say goodbye.
That's it. You're leaving?
It's about time.
What about you?
This isn't the time for me to go anywhere.
I'm guessing you saw the report on the water scandal in the perfume world?
Now that Nougarolis is out of the picture,
we're going to buy his business through Sauveur & Sons.
I have a meeting with Jacques-Yves to discuss distribution.
Then I'll make my offer.
What about my suggestion? What? To invest?
I told you to keep it. I don't want your money.
Use it as you wish.
By the way, there was something I promised not to tell you.
The whole idea about the robbery, the insurance. It wasn't my idea.
Whose was it?
There's an angel watching over you, Daniel. A blonde angel.
five, four, three, two, one…
[all in unison] Happy New Year!
[man] I love you, baby!
Congratulations, baby! Huh?
-Going to varsity. -Yes, that's me.
-When did you get the text? -They've just sent it.
-[giggles] -Let's get out of here.
[man] It might get worse than it already is.
[man] Guys, he's scared!
[man] Happy!
Huh-uh! Please stop! -[Kedibone] Damn! -[pots clattering]
[Kedibone whispers] Wow! Varsity.
Aunt, I passed!
I got three distinctions! Can you believe it? Wow!
Finally, I can get rid of that school uniform.
Oh! By the way, you need to send a deposit along with my matric results.
My girl. Isn't there a cheaper school
Not this again, Aunty.
I told you there is no better school that offers a Degree in Acting.
Acting again?
[sighs] But you said if I pass you going to let me go.
Yes, because I thought you'd realise that there's no money in acting.
Well, that's what I've chosen.
[Magauta] Then that means we have to move to plan B. [Kedibone] But you've never told me about plan B though.
[Magauta] That's because I didn't think we'd needed it… but the way you are carrying on we will definitely need plan B.
but the way you are carrying on we will definitely need plan B.
You remember that stokvel, Hope of Glory that fell apart?
Yes.
Well I took all your varsity savings and invested it there.
[Magauta] I'm leaving.
Aunt, you took my tuition money and invested it in Hope of Glory!
Who does that!
Kedibone! I was hoping for a great return on my investment
so I could give this house a facelift and also pay for your tuition.
Okay, now how will I go to university if there's no money?
Are you saying I should stay at home the whole year?
[Magauta] Am I homebound doing nothing?
I've been working at Checkers for 16 years.
I spoke with my manager
and he said I should bring your CV and you can start working.
Me? Work at Checkers?
If you start now, you'll have a huge pension fund by the time you retire.
That's not going to happen. I'm not going to work at Checkers!
Kedibone!
Stop acting like a spoilt child.
You know the situation. There is no money. It's gone!
[Magauta] My goodness! Huh-uh!
[Magauta] Really!
[Kedibone] You know sometimes I wish my mom was here.
Coz I wouldn't be going through all of this.
Like… I just want to study, baby. I don't want to be a statistic,
I want to leave the township and just further my studies.
-[Kedibone sobs] -Baby.
[Mrembula] Listen… You will go to varsity. Okay?
-Hey? -[giggles]
You seem to forget that I can make anything happen.
Look… I never want to see you cry, baby.
Understand?
Just trust me and all will be fine.
[Kedibone] I need this student loan, please!
-My sister. -It's a bit too late, hey.
I can't help you.
I know, but I really need your help… -I can't afford to take a gap year. -It's already too late.
-I can't afford to take a gap year. -It's already too late.
[Msithi] I'd kill to have a car like this, bra. Eish!
-Cool! -Cool!
There's no jitter here, do you hear. [Mrembula] Because it's a German machine.
[Mrembula] Your dad left you a good inheritance, hey!
Convertible! Coupe. Woah!
[Kedibone] I just wannt study, baby.
[Mrembula] You will go to varsity. Okay?
[Msithi] I am totally going to beat you.
There! Take that!
[Msithi] Hey, Mrembula.
What's up, buddy?
[Msithi] Hah! Take that!
[Msithi] Mrembula… What's up, brother?
I sold my car.
I had to, man.
Kedibone… varsity…
[Msithi] Mrembula, are you telling me that you sold your car?
Because of a girl?
Huh?
[Woman 1] Mrembula sold the car that his father gave him?
[Woman 2] The whole BMW 325i is gone.
How much did you sell it for?
-Twenty five. -What!
[Msithi] Twenty five thousand?
Have you lost your mind? Huh!
You're telling me you sold your whole inheritance for Kedibone…
for R25,000?
You know what that car is? That's a classic.
You and Mrembula are couple goals. [laughs]
You're my role model. Themba… sell his car?
-He would never do that for me. -Bottom line, we're going to varsity.
Yes! First years. First years.
How much do you still need?
Ten thousand…
Okay, listen…
Mrembula said he'd give me R25,000.
So, I will give you R5,0000 and we will both be short.
Kedi…
-Are you being for real? -Yes.
Kedi!
[screaming] Oh…! Kedi!
[Ta Cheeks] This is the car I was telling you about. We call it Rosary.
[Mrembula] Rosary?
[Ta Cheeks] Yeah, you know that thing… Mother Theresa?
[Ta Cheeks] Say a short prayer and it'll get you to work.
[Ta Cheeks] You see? Here's the key.
If you fix it… you can drive it.
[Ta Cheeks] Are we good? [Mrembula] Yeah. Thank you.
[Ta Cheeks chukkes] Sure!
Mrembula bro…
Look at this!
Hey! What's all this?
I'm tired of being friends with guys who can't think with their heads.
[Mrembula clicks tongue] Go to hell!
[Mrembula] Can you fix this car or not? [Msithi] Yeah, the starter just needs a bit of attention.
[Msithi] Yeah, the starter just needs a bit of attention. [Mrembula] Well then stop complaining.
[Msithi] Friends like you are draining, bro!
[Msithi] From a BMW to this!
[Kedibone] Just stop right here.
Right here.
Yoh, Babe! This feels like a dream.
-[closes car door] -I don't know what I'd do without you. Don't worry about it.
As long as we're happy. Calm and relaxed… I'm happy.
Yeah but baby, you didn't have to sell your father's car.
Don't worry about it, baby. We sold that car for a good cause.
Look where you are now?
But baby… this one is so old.
-[giggles] -What?
Which car? This one? This is Rosary.
Give me two months with this car.
You'll see when I pull up in here.
-I'll show them flames. -[Kedibone giggles] [laughing] You will even get new friends.
-[Kedibone giggles] -And besides… I'm getting a Lamborghini with your first paycheck.
-With my paycheck? [laughs] -Yes.
Thank you.
[Mrembula] I love you.
-[Kedibone sighs] -I'll call you.
Baby… -You must drive safe. -[car door closes]
Love you.
Babe!
Babe!
My sister relax. Gents, let's help.
-[closes car door] -Let's go, king.
[Kedibone] Let's go.
[Gheminah] Where did that lady say we are supposed to leave the trays? Um…
I think there where it says 'Out'.
Right there. By the conveyor belts?
Yoh, friend!
-It's like a dream. -[Gheminah giggles]
-Yoh! -[Kedibone giggles] Why is it doing that?
Okay…
They go in there to get washed? Yoh!
What's wrong?
It's just that, like… I'm happy being here but at the same time, I'm pregnant.
I'm happy being here but at the same time, I'm pregnant.
I mean, I am going to show soon… and we eat a lot…
You'll be fine, don't even worry about it…
Oh, don't stress about it.
Are you still my best friend?
[laughs] Of course. Best friend. That's my best friend. [laughs]
[Tanya] Cute… Who are you?
Look at her hair, that poofy thing. Who did that?
It's Neo from Zone 6 in Diepkloof.
So, are you telling me that's your actual hair?
-[laughs] No… -Yeah.
They crotched her and added extensions plus a wig.
Okay, wait, guys.
Are you telling me that total nobodies just joined this conversation?
How is this any of your business? You don't know me, right? You don't know me?
You… tell me… where you from?
I'm from Soweto.
How are you this pretty and you come from there?
Yes?
Right? Because there are no beautiful girls in Soweto?
[Pebbles] Hold on, guys!
Is someone gonna shut this bitch up because she's been talkin--
Okay!
Jeez, guys.
So, are you First years?
Yeah… and you?
[Amanda] Do we look like First years, doll?
[Kedibone] I'm sorry.
[Tanya] Be careful of the Fuck boys on campus, they're a little tricky.
[Tanya] I like you.
We'll see you around.
[Amanda] Bye.
Why are you defending them? They're not your friends.
Yes, but you don't know them either.
Did you come with them? You also don't know them.
Let's go.
Let's go!
[Mrembula] When I try to start the car… nothing.
[Mrembula] When I try to start the car… nothing. So I ask Kedibone to help so I can kick start.
Just before she starts to push… some guys came to the rescue.
Come on, bro! Doesn't she use this car as her Uber?
So if you have to kick start, she must push.
-Huh-uh. Push? -Yeah.
No man, c'mon.
Mrembula there's one thing I don't understand about you.
How can you…
give up your whole inheritance for a girl you haven't even slept with?
Not once. Not even once!
Msithi, don't talk shit.
You know very well I'm waiting for her to turn 21…
then I can deflower her!
Why do you act like you don't know what the deal is?
When she turns 21? Yeah.
What if you die before then?
Should I… deflower her for you?
-[Msithi laughing] -[Kedibone] Three thousand… per month.
-So expensive. -R1,500 a month?
-Where are we going to get this money? -Buy airtime. We need to call them.
To go and see them requires taxi money and…
Hello…
-Hello. -Hi.
I overheard you are looking for accommodation.
[whispers] Hi.
Are you a student?
No, I used to be.
But now, I am an acting lecturer.
Oh, Acting? Me too.
-I am a First Year student. -Seriously?
-Yeah. -Okay.
A young Thespian. Huh?
Lesbian?
-No. Thespian. -Thespian!
I can already see you transforming into the different characters…
and bringing light and shade and dynamics to the roles.
-You go Thespian! -[Kedibone giggles]
Yeah. That's fantastic!
So, where do you stay?
Um… for now we stay at home.
Yeah. We don't have enough money to pay for res.
Oh…and these ones are expensive.
These are all just exploitation of the African child.
Huh?
My friend owns the Bannister Hotel.
Next to it, there's free accommodation.
[in unison] Free?
It's like a backpackers. -What is a backpackers? -Backpackers?
I can show you if you want.
[Dexter] Yes.
Here it is, ladies.
Come in.
[Gheminah] No man!
Why aren't there any windows?
You know living in the city is expensive.
Okay look, if someone moves out, you will get one of the other rooms.
[Gheminah] Woah!
And who's underwear is this?
Ah… these underpants?
Let me move them.
Um… Yeah.
-I can help you get settled-- -No, thanks.
Please give us a moment… to… um, to…
to discuss this.
Oh, you want… -some privacy? Okay. -[girls giggle]
-some privacy? Okay. -[girls giggle] Okay…
I'll see you around then.
[giggling] Friend, you're so extra.
It's my birthday week. What do you want from me?
[Tanya] Ah, I'm gonna get so drunk.
Anyways, let's toast to being fabulous. [giggles]
No! Toast to me… This is about me. Why the fuck would we toast to anything else?
This is about me. Why the fuck would we toast to anything else? -Okay, okay, we'll have it your way. -Yeah!
-Okay, okay, we'll have it your way. -Yeah!
[Gheminah] And I'm not going to serve them
because they think they are better than anyone from Soweto.
Ha! Why are you being so negative?
I'm sure they tip well with all that money. Their table is yours then.
-And we'll share whatever they tip you. -[Kedibone laughs]
-[phone rings] -Babes, it's my dad.
-He's on his way. -Okay.
Hi Franco.
Let me help.
-[Tanya groans] -You're going to be fine.
Hey! -Hey. -How's it going? [kiss on the cheek]
-How are you? -Sharp. Where's my daughter?
Um… she just quickly rushed to the bathroom. She's not feeling well.
You drink girls drink a lot.
-Daddy. -Hi, baby.
My little dolphin.
Ah, dolphin.
Are you okay?
I don't feel well.
Here, have some water.
Yeah, drink.
Daddy, I want you to meet my new friend.
She saved me! Oh, it's the girl with the pretty hair.
I think you need to go home now, dolphin.
Amanda, please come and take her to the car.
Make sure Njabulo takes you home, he's in the car.
Take her bag and everything.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
You must stop drinking too much, baby girl.
[giggles] You're so funny.
-Let me get the bi-- -I have to…
I really want to thank you for saving my little dolphin.
Argh, it's not a problem.
She just wasn't feeling well. That's all.
Has anyone ever told how beautiful you are?
No…
But thank you… Sir.
Huh-uh. Call me Franco.
Sorry.
Ah! You don't have to be sorry.
The person who has to be sorry is the one who made this gorgeous…
beautiful, stunning paragon of human perfection.
Huh? Clean after drunks.
No, no, no. I need his address.
I want to find where he stays. I want to know his parents.
-I will deal with him. Huh? -You're so funny. [laughs]
-What is your name? -Uh… Kedibone.
Can I call you crayfish?
Uh… okay…
[chuckles] Let me get the bill.
Crayfish…
-I owe you one. -[Kedibone chuckles]
[Franco] Three, two, one. Tada!
Daddy, you got me a car!
Crayfish, come. Come celebrate with your friend.
We'll catch up at lunch, okay?
[Franco giggles] Great. [Tanya screams] I got a car!
-How about we ditch school? -Yes!
-And we go shopping. -Yeess!
But I have class soon.
Dude, dude, it's Monday. Everyone in there is hung over. Let's go!
Okay, but I'm broke.
Don't worry. It's on me. Come on!
It's my treat. Let's go. I'll pay for everything.
-[Franco] Dolphin's got a car! -I've got a car!
Let's go, baby. Let's go, Crayfish. -Friend, come! -[Gheminah giggles]
Uh-uh… you stay. [Franco] Go to school. School is cool.
[Franco] Go to school. School is cool.
[Franco] Beautiful girls.
Okay, so let's get back to this.
When you say virgin…
you mean like virgin?
Virgin, virgin?
Yeah… Like never used a tampon, virgin.
Girl, do you know what your vagina looks like?
Yeah.
Does your man know what your vagina looks like?
Yeah, but…
I am waiting until I turn 21.
[scoffs] That's cute.
Let me tell you about my first time.
It was super romantic.
There were flowers, champagne.
His parents are super rich, obviously so… He booked us out this hotel room.
The sex itself was terrible.
But the experience was just wonderful. Okay and…
What does sex feel like?
Sex is amazing!
Sex is like…
it's like God floating down from the heavens on a cloud
and whispering sweet sensations into your ear.
But most guys… Most guys don't know how to make you come so, girl,
you gotta get on that dick and grind and you grind and you grind!
I swear, it'll be amazing.
Eish! That sounds…
Sounds… rough.
You know what.
My first time…
I know Mrembula is a very gentle guy.
-Hmm-mm. -So he's gonna… [inhales] kiss me.
And he's gonna unbutton my shirt.
Uh-huh!
And he's gonna suck on my titties.
Geez, you've got this thing down to like, every clothing item.
And then he is gonna…
Put his penis inside your vagina.
I'm tired of swimming.
I need to go home now. Thank you so much for everything.
I will take you home.
If you don't mind.
Okay. [giggles]
Thank you.
Let's go. You'll be safe. Trust me.
Ah… Crayfish.
So… this is it?
Yeah. It's way smaller than your mansion.
[chuckles] You don't have to be embarrassed.
You have a roof over your head.
Yes, but one day… You know, I'm gonna buy myself a life away from this place.
And you know what that day could be much sooner than you think.
-What do you mean? -I want us to be special friends
and have a special friendship.
Franco… What exactly do you want?
You know what, close your eyes.
Close your eyes. Just wait!
Patience. Patience. Patience.
Don't open your eyes yet.
And now, open…
What's this?
Possibilities.
Here…
It's yours. Take it.
-Uh, Franco, no I… I can't. -No, no, no.
You can't be rude. Don't be rude.
It's a gift. It's yours.
Yeah…
Spend it however you like.
Do your hair, your nails, the works…
Have fun with it.
Okay?
Later.
Jesus Christ!
Woah!
Beauty.
What is this?
It's a phone.
Yeah but… I've got a phone.
Yeah, I bought it for you.
I already have a phone and it works fine.
Huh-uh! This one is also yours. Huh?
One more thing…
I won a cellphone.
You gotta be kidding me!
You won a cellphone, just like that?
No way!
-Congrats, baby. -Thank you, baby.
[chuckles] Actually, I want you to have it.
There we go, there we go!
Beauty.
Go for it, go for it, go for it!
Ah, this palette is so amazing!
I should have gotten one as well.
And these colours are gonna look so good on your skin.
Fuck it, you are beautiful!
Like I forget and then I look at you, I'm just like, "Oh my God, you're beautiful."
And can I tell you something?
Rich people love beautiful shit.
Beautiful cars, beautiful houses.
Beautiful fish. Great.
Fantastic.
I swear to God, Kedi…
with that face… You'll have the rich falling over you.
Opening every door for you.
Will snatch that face…
get you a good weave.
Don't do that. That doesn't look classy.
Afterall…
I want to get you a rich man.
Take you out of poverty.
Woah!
Comrades are really funny, hey.
Seriously man, I'm telling you. If the tender is for R200 million…
and Mbaks wants R50 million…
give it to him. [laughing]
Just give it to him.
How else are you going to get the next tender.
[Business man 1] Hey, cheers guys!
-[Franco] Cheers! -[laughter]
-[Business man 2] All the best. -[Franco] Oh, politicians are very funny.
[Franco] Oh, they are very funny.
-Hello, Bra D. -Hello.
Quick word with you?
Sure. What's wrong?
Bra D, I wanted to know if…
anyone has off days
so I could work during that period?
You want to work overtime again?
Yeah, I need it Bra D.
Your dad used to say the same thing.
"I really need this overtime."
And when I warned him about overworking himself… He said one day, he would buy this place.
Is that why?
Ah… No. Bra D.
Bra D, I'm saving up for lobola.
Huh?
You want to get married? Yes, I do.
Oh my boy… [chuckling]
That's a beautiful thing.
You can work the extra hours.
Just make sure you don't break your back.
Remember, after the wedding,
you still need to consummate the marriage.
-I hear you Bra D. -You know what I'm talking about?
Bra D…
-Thank you Bra D. -Do you have the experience?
[Mrembula] I need to go and fetch this car part that Msithi's been nagging me about.
[Kedibone] Okay. Thank you.
-[Mremula] So… -[car door closes]
[Tanya] I swear to God, I am gonna tag you.
Two thousand likes by the end of the day, darling.
I promise!
Okay? Average.
Hey, Kedi…
Is that not your friend?
-[sighs] -[Tanya] Can you see your likes? Come… see your likes.
That is a beautiful picture. It's pretty. [giggles]
[Dexter] So… who has to come up first and show us something?
Kedibone. Why don't you come up? Let's show them something.
So we sit down.
We lock our toes.
And we lock our hands.
And we lock our eyes.
And on my count…
One…
Two…
Three…
Let me not into the marriage of true minds.
Admit impediments.
We tried our best but you're not forgiving us.
Love does not insist in its own way.
Your name is Martha
and you will work in that factory for a duration of six months.
After which you will pack all your belongings
and go back to those very valleys and mountains,
where you will be greeted by smiles and giggles.
From the children you've left for a whole six months.
And they will be expecting gifts from…
from that Johannesburg.
But as you step onto your doorstep…
you realise that all those gifts that were promised by Johannesburg…
were intangible.
[Dexter] That's it. That's it Kedi. Well done!
Nice one.
Rise of the African child.
[Dexter] Good. Okay, I'll see you guys next week.
-Alright, have a good one. -Bye, Sir.
Kedibone… May I have a word with you.
I was wondering if… -I can meet you in the dressing room… -[phone ringing]
Once you've gotten your things.
Just something that I wanna talk to you about.
Okay… um…
-Dressing room… I'll see you there. -[phone ringing] Okay. It's this side.
[sighs] Hi, Franco…
Yeah. I know, I know.
Can I just call you later?
Bye.
Rise of the African Child.
It's a big play, you know.
It's important to us Africans.
[sighs] And Kedibone…
you're perfect for this role.
It's as if it was written for you.
You'll see.
It's going to be wonderful.
You're perfect.
Just perfect.
[Gheminah] So, aren't we talking anymore?
-Friend… -No!
[Gheminah] Don't "friend" me. I can't get hold of you.
When I call, you don't answer 'cause you're busy with Franco…
Wait, let me get my phone.
♪ Hey, Kedi Do you love me? ♪

Oh okay, so…
Those people who send you… -To television stations? -To auditions.

Got you.
Babe. The necklace?
Is that real?
No, baby, I got from China Town.
It's so cheap.
It cost about R20.
Yoh, no. It looks like…
Like the real thing.
They really know how to make these things these days.
Ah, you know how the Chinese are.
-I know them. -[Kedibone chuckles]
Don't worry we'll be alright.
Soon we'll be able to afford to eat crayfish.
Hey? As well as…
Lobster, huh?
The high life things.
Fuck it, you're beautiful!
And can I tell you something, rich people love beautiful shit!
After all, I want to get you a rich man.
Take you out of poverty, you know.
-Good day. -Hi.
Take a seat.
How can I help you?
Ma, I actually came to…
I want Kedibone's hand in marriage.
I… I want to make her my wife.
Hah! That will never happen.
This child! [claps hand]
No, that can't happen.
-Why not? -No ways.
Please hear me out.
Kedibone…
I love Kedibone.
Are you ready for marriage?
Or you think marriage is a joke.
-I am ready. -Okay, forget that.
I'll pretend that I'm Kedibone.
Propose to me so I can see if you're as ready as you claim to be.
Okay… um… [clears throat]
Uh… Put the ring on my finger!
Kedi…Kedibone.
K… K… Kedibone Ma… Manamela.
Are you just going to keep calling her name?
And not state your intention?
If you're going to propose to Kedibone, you need to be confident.
And not stutter, Kedibone, Kedibone!
I will allow you to marry Kedibone
but don't do what you just did ever again.
This won't work. Go and practise!
Use a mirror and make sure you know what to say when you talk to Kedibone.
Go, go, go!.
It's a surprise.
Wait a minute, wait a bit.
Stand right here.
-Okay, now I'm nervous. -Okay. Ready?
This is yours.
Fully paid and all.
Welcome home, Crayfish.
What!
[Kedibone] This is so…
Look at my view!
No frickin ways!
[whispers] Do you want a taste of this crayfish?
[whispers] Yes, Crayfish.
Yes.
-[Msithi] Isn't there a lift? -[Mrembula] We're already here my guy.
[Mrembula] We're going to get fit here.
[Msithi] I am already fit.
I was born fit.
So, baby, what do you think?
-Yeah! You did well. -[high five clap]
-Ah! The view! -[Kedibone giggles]
Look at the Jozi skyline.
-Ah, wow! -[Kdedboni giggles]
So, tell me…
the agent put all of this together?
Yes, baby. All of it.
Marble floors, marble kitchen, everything.
-Just for you? -No, baby, with Tanya.
This other girl from school. She is so cool.
I also want this for myself one day.
Wow! Yeah!
Tony Montana views.
The world is mine!
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you. Hey, hey!
Are you jealous now, Msithi.
We're here on the December 16 holiday.
And I can't wait for us to make great memories, right here.
-Right here? -Mmm…
-Like… now? -Mmm-hm. [giggles]
Msithi…
Go kick start the car, we're leaving soon.
-I have to go. -Okay.
Bye, baby. [kiss]
I'm telling you Msithi the first three weeks…
I couldn't sleep…
Thinking about how these rich boys might try and get with Kedi.
At least she got a decent place now.
The one she used to live in was trash.
Yeah, yeah. I agree.
She's in heaven now compared to where she was.
Tell me something. Is she only staying with her friend?
Of course.
And the agent is paying rent?
Yeah, that sounds just about right.
Have you met this agent?
What business do I have with the agent? Have you met him? Do you even know his name?
Have you met him? Do you even know his name?
-Who are you talking about? -The agent.
Msithi, how am I supposed to know?
What's with all these questions? You should've asked Kedibone!
I don't know anything about agents and how these things work.
Okay, then. Don't get so emotional.
Delivery for Kedibone.
Kedibone?
That's me.
Rise of the African Child.
You know, Dineo… This is a big play.
And you are just the right person for this role.
You and only you are perfect for this role.
It's as if they wrote this play for you.
Yes?
I thought you said you'd call me.
Look, my plate is kinda full right now, so… yeah.
But do you know what, I really need this class in order to pass.
I don't know, Kedibone.
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
I saw on Instagram you are looking for actors and models.
Well, I'm studying to be an actress.
Oh, okay.
Uh… tell me… What kind of acting do you do.
Well, I am acting on a stage play at school.
And they gave me a lead role…
w… which I lost but I'm gonna get it back soon. [giggles]
Tell me, what are you busy with next weekend. Are you are available?
I'm definitely free!
-Hello. -Hello, Sir.
Uh… I would like to make a withdrawal, please.
Okay please insert your card there.
Please enter your pin.
Okay, so… how much do you want to draw?
All of it.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Please hurry up, my sister.
So, where do I get the script?
Don't worry where you are going. They will have a script for you my angel.
And how much do you pay?
Let me tell you.
Eighty thousand rand. For starters!
Eight… Eighty thousand…
My girl, I'm telling you.
Plenty more where that came from.
Okay, this is all of it.
Twenty thousand… as you requested.
Am I gonna get my lead role back?
Yes.
-Ah! -How are you?
I called you here because I want to know who you've invited for the ceremony.
I've already spoken to Gheminah about it.
She said she'll invite the friends from varsity.
Okay, but don't forget about the cousins.
And the rest of the family.
This is a big deal.
I won't forget about them.
It's just that I wanted to lay low because you know, it's a surprise.
I'm aware that it's a surprise.
I know how to keep a secret.
What I want to know is do you have the funds to make this possible?
Financially I'm sorted.
I even got overtime pay from work.
She's also found an agent. Everything is going according to plan.
Hey! Wow!
Thank God for that agent.
He's a gift from above.
Oh, now I'm convinced that this acting thing…
You know… it's working for her.
I'm also going to see if we can extend an invitation to the agent.
You see, now you're talking.
The agent needs to bear witness to everything.
-You know what I'm saying. -I hear you loud and clear.
Okay then…
I'm preparing dinner now and you're not invited.
Please…
Okay Ma'am, on another note…
I think you have a hidden talent.
Could you hit me with one more note…
-before I leave. [giggles] -Hey!
Okay girl, outside.
Make sure you get the job done.
He can have you, okay? [laughing]
What's this?
How are you going to work like this? Go get changed.
Hurry up and start drinking.
Ooh, I can't deal with ghetto girls.
You okay?
-I think she wants some. -She should. Definitely.
It'll make you feel so good. Trust me.
Have just a little. I cut a little line just for you.
It's a nice small one…
It's good, hey?
-Did you inhale? -[giggling]
It's good, hey? I feel like I'm getting a nose bleed
Fuck!
Don't forget that you're paying.
Yes. Yes.
You see…
-Hi… -Who's this?

Yeah, where are you? I'm still at your house and…
Yeah, where are you? I'm still at your house and… I need my money.
Listen, I'm at the airport now getting ready to go to Cape Town so…
You said you'd give me R 80,000. When are you going to give it to me?
Let me send you…
-You wanted your R500. -Five hundred ra…
-What! -Please don't stress me.
I'm tired and I'm late for my flight, bye.
No, but you…
More lemon, please.
Thank you.
Kedibone.
-How are you? -Hi, Sir.
Don't call me sir. We're not at school.
Let's dance.
No, I can't dance because these heels are killing me.
I'm not used to them.
Oh!
Can I join you?
Do you need some company?
I'm actually waiting for my friends they just went to the bathroom.
They'll be back for their seats.
I'll see you around then.
Shots?
I don't do tequila shots.
Look around, it's a nominations after-party.
Loosen up a bit.
Yes, but do you see that old man over there?
-That old man? -Yes.
Tequila did that to him.
He's an old man.
You can't compare the two.
Come on.
Okay fine.
Yeah!

Okay…

Hey, Babe…
Smiso.
Smiso!
You, get up!
-Are you kidding me? -Oh shit!
Are you serious?
Babe listen, when did you land?
Fuck you!
Now I know why your phone is off! You were busy with this whore!
In my house! Babe, I had… -I had an awards ceremony. -Get your hands off me!
You!
Get your things and get the fuck out of my house. Now!
[softly] Pamela, leave her.
Don't… You're don't have to talk to her like that.
We are supposed to be getting married. I am pregnant with your child
but as soon as I turn my back you fuck around like this!
What is wrong with you, Smiso!
I can explain.
Are you still here!
Get up and get out!
Get the fuck out of my house. Get the fuck out of my house!
Don't talk to her like that.
Leave me alone!
Get the fuck out of my house!
Baby…
Eish! Shit!
Kedibone…
It's going to be alright.
Don't be scared.
Are you okay?
[whispers] Yeah.
Okay.
We should go to bed.
S… Step…
on…
Please! One line, one line.
[whispers] Please!
[Tanya inhales] Okay. It's time.
No wait, wait. Please!
Well, you're pregnant.
Fuck!
Fuck! [hits table]
Eww Kedi!
-[Tanya flicks off pregnancy test] -[Kedibone] Fuck!
Are you gonna tell your boyfriend?
It's not his?
[Tanya] So… what's the plan?
Kedibone… What's going on? I'm in the middle of my lecture.
I'm pregnant.
It's not mine.
Dexter, a girl always knows, okay.
No… No, she doesn't.
I want an abortion.
Um… okay.
-Let's do it. -I'm broke. I only have like… 2000.
-And I need 7000. -Yoh! I don't have that kind of money.
So, this is your cousin?
-Yes, I am the cousin. -Yeah.
So you're claiming that's my child?
[whispers] Franco…
I did everything you asked me to do.
We'd go to fancy parties. Do my make-up, dress up and then show up.
This how you treat me?
From being a crayfish to just being pollution in the ocean?
Is this how you see me now?
You know what?
I didn't send you…
to be a porn star. Do you hear me?
Hmm? Busy entertaining other men. Hmm!
Like a whore. After everything!
Like a whore. After everything! After everything I have done for you!
From me.
I sacrificed every single thing for you.
I sacrificed my youth and my beauty for you, Franco.
You took my virginity.
And you took my money.
What did you do with all of it?
I paid for tuition.
And I have to eat.
How much are we talking about exactly? Uh… Five thousand.
Are you mad!
Then I'm keeping it.
If the family finds out about the pregnancy…
they will come for you.
I'm coming with.
Let's go.
Mavis, car keys!
[Tanya] The biggest whore in the fucking world!
-What? -We know you slept with her father.
How could you do this to me?
[Tanya] Don't you… [Gheminah] Hey! Hey!
Don't you dare touch her!
-[Kedibone] I need a drink. -[car door closes]
[Mrembula] A drink like alcohol?
-[Kedibone] Yes. -[Mrembula] Now?
[Kedibone] Just drive.
-How's things Msithi? -Good thanks and yourself?
I'm good, can I have the usual.
Alright, sharp!
I got a nice surprise for you.
Check this out.
Who this is?
Don't forget that you're paying.
Touch is a move and a move is a price.
No man, is this not Kedibone?
-Yes, that's her. -Mrembula's girl?
-Yers. -Where did you get it?
-Instagram. -Oh, I see… You've got data, hey.
She's a slay queen now?
-Thanks. -Cheers!
I'm going to the bathroom, okay
-What's up man. -I'm good, what's up?
Why are you checking out my girl.
-What's up with that? -What? -What's up with that? -Oh! Oh!
Chill man, let me show you something.
Don't forget that you're paying.
Touch is a move and a move is a price.
Hey, he saw you!
Where did you get this?
It's on the…
You know what, forget it.
We're leaving.
Oh, baby.
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.
Kedibone are you cheating on me?
-What? -You heard me. Answer my question.
Are you cheating?
No, baby. What are you talking about?
Explain to me why there's a video of you… twerking on some random guys…
On that guy's phone back at the restaurant.
So you are accusing me of cheating?
Seriously, Tebogo?
I'm at school every day but you're accusing me of cheating!
You know what, it's fine.
I can tell you've found someone else.
What!
-You've found someone else. -Someone else? -You got a new girlfriend Tebogo. -Someone else?
If you want to break up do it like a man.
What are you on about?
I'm trying and… Here I am thinking I have your support.
You're not being fair, baby.
I'm sorry.
Sorry. It's just…
It's just that the way that guy was looking at you…
Next thing…
I see someone who looks like you… Babe…
Cheating on you is the last thing on my mind.
Tebogo.
-Look at me. -Please don't lie to me.
[whispers] Please don't lie to me.
I would never lie to you, baby.
I would never lie to you.
Oh, Msithi?
We need to talk.
And Tebogo?
I need to talk to you alone.
What is it? Is everything okay?
Are you cheating?
-What? -Cut the crap!
Don't act all innocent here.
I see your promiscuous ways!
Me, promiscious? I don't know what you're talking about.
I have been seeing you with these celebrity guys.
Driving Lamborghini's with big bellies and high blood pressure.
I am the dealer that side. You don't think they tell me these things.
You know…
All wanted to do in this industry was… just to make it.
But then you meet…
Can I call you crayfish?
A young Thespian.
I saw on Instagram that you are looking for actors and models.
So you do know who I am?
To meet mercy people and then…
They sell you the world…
What's this?
Possibilities!
And you, Kedibone…
You're perfect for this role.
So, how much do you guys pay?
Eighty thousand rand. Just for starters!
I mean I am chilling with actors, colleagues, producers.
How are you gonna get to know anyone in the industry if you're chilling here?
And then they just wanna use you for your looks.
Great fit!
Woah!
I didn't know how I was going to tell Tebogo.
I mean… [inhales]
He paid for my tuition…
by selling his inheritance!
I know.
[whispers] I'm sorry.
I'm not the one you're cheating on.
You need to apologise to Mrembula not me!
Yes, I know Msithi.
Can I use your phone?
I wanna call these other girls. They wanted to come fetch me and…
I just wanna cancel my plans, please.
You're sleeping around… but you can't afford airtime?
[whispers] Thank you.
[whispers] Msithi?
[whispers] Thank you.
Stop!
[Msithi] Bloody cheater!
You have reached the voicemail box of…
Yeah, Cray, Cray.
You put me on voicemail.
Hey!
You took me for a ride.
And played with my heart.
You know, Crayfish…
I gave you everything I have.
I was there for you emotionally.
Financially.
Physically.
And you just drop me automatically.
Hey Crayfish… Crayfish!
[crying] You hurt me Crayfish.
Cray…
Woah!
Life is tough!
Hey!
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
-You know this one's for you, right? -[students cheering]
Smash, Smash, Smash, Smash!
Can I have a word?
What!
I've meant to give you a call.
It's just I realised I don't even have your number.
You already got what you wanted.
Listen…
I came to apologise.
I should have said that I'm… engaged.
You must think I'm a dog.
Dogs are cute!
You are evil, Smash!
Hey, come on, I…
You raped me.
Rape?
Kedi, I didn't… I didn't rape you.
We both got back…
You raped me, Smash.
Hear me out. Hear me out.
I genuinely wanna help you.
You said you wanna get into the industry. I wanna hook you up. I wanna…
-I want you to meet my people. -You know what. -Get into his book… -You're wasting my time.
Kedi…
Kedi…
Smash! Smash! Smash!
Hello.
I brought some baby clothes.
Thank you.
Themba.
Come get the baby.
So…
How's life been treating you?
Fine.
[whispers] I'm sorry.
Hi, baby.
[chuckles] Okay where are you taking me?
Yeah, but how must I know what to wear when I don't know where you're taking me.
[chuckles] Baby, come on, you know I hate surprises.
[giggles] Okay, okay fine.
Cool.
Ah! Crayfish! [chuckles]
I don't like how things ended between us.
-I know your birthday is coming up. -Don't touch me!
I bought you something, hey.
Voila!
You bought me a car?
This is not just any car.
This is a machine.
I'm fine. You can keep it.
Since when?
I'm moving out.
-Where to? -I'm going back home.
Am I a joke to you?
I will tell you when to leave.
I'm the one paying for this apartment.
Do you hear me!
And you still owe me.
One last round.
-Where do you think you're going? -Don't touch me!
-Get off me! -You're my whore, I own you. Now shut up!
Kedibone!
[whines] Baby…
He's the agent I told you about. Agent?
Kedibone what's going on here?
-Huh? -Guess who's in trouble now.
I'm sorry, baby.
Here's the story young man, listen carefully.
I know this looks bad.
But I'll save you the heartache.
Kedibone?
There's a lot of women out there and they're still gonna hurt you.
I know because I was once a young man like you.
They'll hurt you real bad.
You see how full of fish the ocean is?
Crayfish there, crayfish all over.
And you know what you did? You chose one crayfish and…
And you put it in the fridge. And left the door unlocked.
What did you think was going to happen?
I opened the door and helped myself to some crayfish.
And it was appetising.
I must say, your crayfish is delicious. Never tasted anything better.--
-Tebogo, please. -[Franco screaming]
Tebogo you're hurting him.
Tebogo stop!
Let him go.
Let go of me!
Tebogo no, no no…
Please don't kill me, I'm sorry.
Let's talk about this. C'mon man.
Let's go.
Tebogo you're hurting me, let me go!
Tebogo you are hurting me.
Let go of me.
-Shut up! -Baby, I'm sorry.
Baby, I'm sorry.
Baby, listen, I'm sorry.
-Get inside. -Please.
-[car enging starts] -Kedibone Manamela.
My pure innocent woman.
Virgin!
Virgin!
You!
Jesus!
Your dad left you a good inheritance in this car.
-He did! -[screaming]
[Kedibone] I just wanna study, baby.
-Baby, please. -Don't touch me!
Tell me about your agent.
It's really not what you think.
Kedibone Manamela!
-Baby, I'm sorry. -Jesus!
I'm sorry, baby!
You are sorry? Are you sorry for my father's car.
-I can't do this anymore. -Use the other bathroom then.
I need to get away for a while.
What?
We both know it's true.
This isn't working anymore.
I thought I might go to Malaga with Peder.
You're going on vacation with Peder?
I need some time to think.
Okay?
Good night. I'm going to bed now.
Eliot, honey, you need to get up now.
Daniél?
Daniél?
Daniél?
THANK YOU, I'M SORRY
The chimpanzee is the human's closest now living relative.
We need to go a long way back in time to find…
-Hi. -Where is he?
-In there. -Thanks.
I'm not getting a pulse.
See that?
He's cold too.
He's very stiff.
He must've been dead for hours.
It looks that way.
Can you talk to the family?
Okay.
Hi, Helen.
It's Sara.
I know it's early, but I'm calling because…
Daniél… I tried to wake him,
but he wouldn't wake up.
Yes.
Mummy, did you know that people used to be monkeys?
The dinosaurs died
and then the monkeys turned into cavemen.
I used to be a monkey too. Can you be a monkey now, Mummy?
IFK Norrköping takes the lead with 1-0
in this opening match of the All-Swedish league. David Moberg Karlsson scores the goal.
Okay. You can have one.
One.
No, you're not having any more.
Definitely no more for you.
There. There you go.
-Hi, Dad. -Linda, where are my slippers?
-What did you say? -My slippers.
I need them.
Can't the staff help you look for your slippers?
For fuck's sake. They're crazy.
They just keep singing "clap your hands" like idiots.
-You have to come here. -Yep, I'm coming. Okay?
Good. Good, good.
Right. Bye.
So.
-In there. -Right.
-In there. -Right.
I'm Ivan, the doctor on call.
Helen. Daniél's mother.
Daniél's father.
So… It's like this… I am here--
I think it's best if I record this.
It can be hard to remember what's been said when you're in shock.
I see it all the time in my work as a psychologist.
Yes, of course.
Um, well…
The most likely scenario
is that his heart stopped beating while he was asleep.
The body shows no signs whatsoever of a death-struggle.
Of course, we'll do an autopsy to determine the cause of death,
but it's highly likely that it was an undiagnosed heart condition.
I slept on the sofa.
Okay.
You slept on the sofa?
I… I have trouble sleeping because of my belly.
I generally sleep on the sofa to avoid getting woken up by Daniél.
I struggle to get back to sleep. That's why I was sleeping on the sofa.
There's nothing you could have done.
It's important you understand that, Sara.
Oh, wow!
Nice.
-Do you think so? -Yes. Definitely.
-Zlatan! -What was that?
Hello. Hello, my love. Hi.
-No way! You have a dog? -Yeah.
-Hi! -This is Zlatan. My dog.
You know, I've always wanted to have a dog.
-Great. -Eh, boy.
-I have one. -Are you a good boy, Zlatan?
Yes, you are.
Look, I've got us some water.
I'm afraid I don't have any ice, though.
-There you go. -Thank you.
How about some music? There we go.
-Oops. -Oops.
-Oops. -Oops.
What are you doing here?
You have a boyfriend?
-We're supposedly on a break. -We are?
Yes, you said you wanted to take a break.
You said, "In order for me to really be myself
in this relationship, I need to be alone for a while."
-What's your name? -Ludde.
-Ludde. -Ludvig.
My name's Jasse.
I should go.
What I said was I couldn't feel what she wanted.
I struggle with people who can't express what they want
when I feel a need to feel what it is they want.
I've met so many women who I haven't been able to feel.
Right, well…
-Hey… You "feel" me, right? -You probably shouldn't touch me now.
No.
-I'm leaving now. -Mm.
-I'm gonna stab you and murder you! -Ow, ow, ow!
Ow! Mercy!
I've got you now!
When Daddy gets home, he's going to eat you up.
I've made an appointment with the priest.
She would like you to think about which hymns you'd like.
I really like "Day by Day, And With Each Passing Moment."
Have you spoken to Eliot about the funeral?
I told him Daniél's away on business.
I can tell him if you want.
I just don't know what to tell him.
No. It's okay if you want to wait a little while.
I'll start calling people now.
I'm gonna stab you!
MOVING BOX
Hi.
Hi. You've moved all your stuff back in?
I didn't like living with Maja. Didn't work out last time either.
-What do you mean, last time? -I was giving you some space.
-Come. -We could've talked about it first.
I've missed you.
My dad called.
My little sister's husband is dead.
Do you have a sister?
My little sister, Sara. I think I told you about her.
I moved out with Dad after the divorce.
I found the perfect avocados. Just the way you like them.
Anyway, her husband just died, just like that.
Bummer.
Dad thinks I should go to the funeral, but that he…
Because he and Sara… Well, he can't go.
I don't really know what to do.
What's the matter?
It's just that you haven't asked me how I'm doing.
-I don't think you should touch me now. -Right.
Come on.
Oh my God. I am so sorry.
-I'm normally never late. -It's fine.
Welcome. Have a seat.
-Can I give you a hand? -No.
Alright. So, I just wanted to get a sense of who Daniél was.
-Who he was? -Mm.
Anything you'd like me to talk about at the funeral?
It can be anything, big or small.
-Well, we got married after we had Eliot. -Mm.
But we met while we were studying law. And we moved out here last year.
Daniél wanted to be closer to his parents.
I see.
And for the sake of the kids, of course.
People say it's just a 30-minute bus ride, and that they'll come and visit,
but the problem is that no one ever does.
You're probably thinking, at least there's fresh air
and a big lawn and a husband to share it all with.
But suddenly he just disappears.
He's gone, and I think it's disgusting behaviour.
What about your parents? Mum, Dad? Do you have any siblings?
One older sister, but we're not in contact.
And your parents?
They're dead.
-What are you drawing? -It's a pig. It's sad.
It only has one friend and that's just a fat, old raccoon.
I can see that.
Are you also sad?
Do you miss Dad?
We could call him.
No, we can't call Dad.
Because he's like that bird. You know, the one we buried in the garden.
Is Daddy dead?
-So, he won't be coming home next week? -No.
Can you be a monkey now?
Louder.
Much louder.
Louder!
Louder.
Louder, Mummy! Louder!
Louder!
-Should I…? -No.
-Look, Mummy! A dog! -Not now, Eliot.
Yes!
-Is that your dog? -Yes, it is.
-What's its name? -What? It's Zlatan.
Is it called Satan?
-No, his name's Zlatan. -Satan?
-Zlatan. -Satan!
-Are you coming, Sara? -Satan!
Eliot, Grandma and Grandpa are waiting for us.
-We have to go now. Come on. -No.
I heard there'd be coffee at your place.
Daniél loved chocolate.
I remember buying a small piece of chocolate cake.
I'd put it in the kitchen, on the table,
and I was pottering about in there, and then I went to the bathroom…
-Hi. -Hi.
He loves balls.
Wanna have a go?
Come here, Zlatan.
We can't have a dog because my Mummy's allergic.
Right.
My Daddy's going to get burned up.
He's going into a big oven.
-Wanna go on the swing? -Yes.
Okay. Thought so.
Did you know that your mum loved to go on the swing?
-Hi. -Hi.
Higher!
Higher!
Higher!
Here I come!
I'm flying! I'm flying!
You've done a great job of things today, Sara.
Yes, very nice.
No, no, no!
Eliot! Eliot!
I knew it.
-It hurts. -Come on.
There, there. Just keep your head back like that.
-Sorry about Olle. -Eliot.
Eliot. Right.
I didn't know he wasn't holding on.
But he's okay?
His dad's just died, so, no, he's not okay.
-Oh, I'm sorry. -It's fine.
-Take care. -Yes.
Bye.
-How did you find out about Daniél? -Helene…
-Helen. -Helen.
-Oh, I'm sorry. -It's fine.
-My condolences. -Yes.
-My condolences. -Thank you.
Helen called Dad.
I was just at the home visiting him for a bit.
-He really wanted to come. -You can go now.
-Grandpa? -Yes?
-Did you see that dog? -Yes, what was its name?
-His name was Satan. -Zlatan, right.
-He's kind of yellowy golden. -Yes, he was. Okay.
Okay…
Pinto pinto gorgorito…
I understand why you haven't had much contact with her.
Linda. But I had to call your dad. You are family, at the end of the day.
In times like these you need your family.
I think it would be a good idea if I moved in here.
You can't do everything on your own with Eliot.
And soon you'll have a little baby too.
I'll just take some time off from the clinic
so I can be here with you full time.
We're fine.
Sara, I understand that you are very sad.
I'm sad too.
We've both lost him.
But I have lost my child.
My son.
I'm going to bed now. Eliot has to be up early tomorrow, so…
I'll call a taxi.
José, I'll call a taxi.
Helen? You don't have to smile. It can recognise you anyway.
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands
-These are tasty. -Yeah.
-Yeah. They're not the ones I usually buy. -Buy? Don't you bake them yourself?
When did you ever teach me to bake?
Shut up, God damn it!
Every Monday, every Wednesday, every fucking day, three hours.
Clap, clap. Clap, clap.
I was at Tiny's after the funeral.
I took some pictures.
That's her garden.
That's her son Eliot.
Are you going to visit her again?
Oh, look. Jasse's calling.
I can… No, Dad.
Don't tell me you're still seeing him?
Hey. Give it to me.
Hi.
Hi.
-Dammit, Linda. -I can't talk. I'm on the…
You self-absorbed fucking manbaby!
No, I'm on the underground. Some weird old Finnish guy's shouting.
-You have the world's smallest dick! -What?
Yeah, he's really unpleasant.
Listen, I'll be home soon, so I… See you then. Okay, kiss.
Dad!
I want to go home now.
Dad, you live here now. Remember?
Your mum lives here.
Mummy!
-Eliot! -Mummy! Mummy!
Eliot?
Mummy's here now. What happened?
I dreamt that Daddy buried you in the garden.
Oh, honey.
I'm not under the garden, I'm here.
Lie down.
Let's sing together, okay?
Tuu tuu tupakkirulla
Mistäs tiesit…
Who's knocking?
I don't know.
They'll have to come back tomorrow.
Hi!
-What are you doing?! -I knocked but you didn't answer, so I…
I just wanted to say hi and see how Eliot's doing with his nose and…
Do you know what time it is?
-Half past eight. -Eliot's asleep.
-What, now? -He's five. He goes to bed at 7.30.
Can I…
You can't bring that in here. You know I'm allergic.
-It was just something Mum said. -What?
-Yeah, she lied. -What?
No, Zlatan. Hey!
She made me promise not to tell you. I was never to tell you.
That's why I never told you.
Zlatan!
-Thanks. Aren't you going to have one? -No.
-It's not allowed. -No, it's not allowed.
-Must be due soon. -In four weeks.
I don't have children of my own, but I do have Zlatan.
And Zlatan is a real handful. There's always something.
Would you sit down?
I can't believe Mum lied about me being allergic.
All I ever wanted was a dog.
I just think she really didn't want one.
-It's typical of her to make up an excuse. -She had her hands full.
With a man who was unfaithful and hid booze all over the house, you mean.
Anyway, how are you doing?
-What's up? -Are you joking?
No. It's been ages since we saw each other.
At Mum's funeral.
It's not that I didn't want to come and see you, I just thought
you never wanted to see me again.
Why did you think that?
Because you said, "I never want to see you again."
It was not an easy day.
-Your dog bit the priest. -That wasn't Zlatan.
That was my first Zlatan. The other Zla… I mean… My other Zlatan.
I think you should go now.
I understand.
Listen, I'm…
I'm really sorry for just barging in without contacting you.
But there's something else as well.
It's Dad.
He's not doing too well. He's started forgetting things.
Sometimes he's his old self, so I thought you might want to come and visit.
Come.
You can sleep on the sofa, so you won't have to wake him.
Where's Eliot?
It's half past eight, we have to go now.
He's already left.
What?
We left early. He was so keen to go with Linda and the dog.
With Linda?
He went with Linda?
Yes, that's how it went today.
But we were supposed to go.
Yeah.
It's wonderful that we can be together. We need each other.
Yes, definitely.
Look. There's the evil dragon.
Yes.
-It's not evil. It's kind. -Yes, beautiful.
Yes, we're here every day.
-It's a beast called Red. -Of course. Very sad.
No, we're not leaving them.
-You'll get it soon, Grandpa. -Yes, I understand.
Yes. Can I call you back?
Didn't we agree that I would take him to preschool on Wednesdays?
-Yes. -He doesn't know her.
Why would you want a complete stranger--
She's not a complete stranger, she's my big sister.
But Eliot has never met her before and you disowned her.
But, of course, sibling relationships are often highly complex.
-I see it all the time as a psychologist. -Linda has slept over once.
And Eliot loves her dog.
Sara, Eliot doesn't need someone who'll only show up when it suits them.
He needs stability and security.
He doesn't have a dad anymore, which causes a lot of anxiety for a child.
You're in mourning and can't do everything on your own.
In a month, you'll have another child.
You can barely take care of the one you already have.
What did you just say?
Did you say I can't take care of Eliot?
Do you ever even talk about Daniél at all?
No.
My son is dead, and I don't even get to bury him in one piece.
He wanted to be cremated. You said it was fine as long as he got a headstone.
But I want all of my Daniél to be there.
All of Daniél no longer exists.
Why are you so angry?
Are you even mourning him at all?
Maybe that's what Eliot needs, to see his mum being sad.
Listen, I--
I'm here because I threw a mobile phone at my mother-in-law's head.
Was she hurt?
Just two stitches. She says I'm just angry.
-That I'm not grieving in the right way. -There are many ways to grieve.
I think everyone in this room can agree on that.
-Right? -Yes.
Grief's love that's become homeless.
I don't understand why we have to sit here and talk about it.
It doesn't matter, they're still gone.
It's not like they're suddenly going to come back. This is pointless.
I had four years with my Rickard. Those were the happiest years of my life.
We were always together, we did everything together.
So, when they called and told me he was dead
my legs buckled.
I declined every invitation,
spent every weekend alone, even at Christmas.
One day my little brother turned up in my garden.
I asked him to leave, but he wouldn't go.
I yelled at him that he should go to hell.
And then he left and he has never come back.
I don't know why I'm telling…
I'm going to catch you. I'm going to catch you.
Get the ball! Go get the ball. I want it, I want it.
Can we see each other tomorrow? And the day after that?
And the day after that. And the next and the next…
-If it's okay with your mum. -Linda?
-Sorry. -About what?
I thought maybe I'd done something wrong.
Do you want to move in with us?
And help me a bit until before…
And afterwards. Only if you want to.
So, you want me to, like, stay with you for a while?
Yes.
With me and Eliot.
Yes, and the baby too.
And Zlatan.
Yeah.
I can call every day.
-Don't touch me right now. -Right.
Come on, Zlatan.
Bye!
Linda. Linda, do you need some help?
No, I'm fine.
-Come on. -Oh, my phone's ringing.
Hello? No, she's leaving now.
Nice of you to ask how I'm doing.
I have been working so hard to make sure we'd have a good life together.
It feels like she's not investing as much in our relationship as I am.
It hurts so bad. I love her so very much.
Can't go wrong with water.
This is delicious.
It tastes like anus.
-Eliot! -I've told him that he can't say "shit."
Linda, what do you do for a living?
I won the lottery.
-What? -What?
Yeah, two years ago. 548,000 kronor.
That must be nice, right?
Yeah.
But you had a job before you won the lottery?
Yes, at a retirement home.
And you still have contact with your father?
Yes.
But I only visit him occasionally. He's not very well.
-He's messed up his head with booze. -Who?
-Grandpa. -I have another grandpa?
No.
-This is really delicious. -How did he break his head?
-Alcohol, honey. -Helen.
You're making a big mistake, Sara.
She lives here now.
I'll take that. I know where it goes.
Mum, why have I never met my grandpa?
Because he doesn't want to see me.
When I was your age, I used to sit on the swing and wait for him.
But he never came.
I would like to see him some time.
Hiya!
I can't do this.
Give Eliot a nice childhood.
Having to be Mummy and Daddy.
And soon…
two childhoods that I have to get right.
I can't do it.
Come here.
There. Come here.
You're wearing Daniél's shirt.
Sorry.
-All my clothes were… -It's okay.
…dirty.
Is Zlatan going to die?
-Yes. -Are you going to die?
Yeah, but not until I'm like a hundred years old.
-Together with Zlatan. -Yes, exactly.
I like you, Uncle Linda.
I like you too.
-Are these new pills? -Is it three o'clock yet?
It's a quarter to. Are these new?
At three o'clock, they serve coffee and cake in the dining hall.
We don't usually go there.
I've bought some myself.
It's not 3 p.m. yet.
No.
-What's funny? -Why did you put strawberries in the tea?
Because it's tasty.
I know she's angry with me.
Your little sister.
-I like strawberries in my tea. -What?
No!
Grandma!
Hi, honey.
Hi, sweetie.
-Hi. -Hi.
Hi.
Is that Daddy?
Yes, it's your daddy's ashes.
"The world's best dad, Sara's husband and our beloved son."
Isn't that what we agreed?
Yes, it's great, Helen. It's great.
-Is it my turn now? -Yes.
Here's a torch so you won't be afraid of the dark.
This is a drawing of you and me and Mummy
and Uncle Linda and Zlatan.
And Grandma and Grandpa.
And here's a banana for if you get hungry.
Fifty-one, seven, eight…
It's like Helen's competing, who's grieving the most.
…hundred, and seven.
-That makes… -One plus one plus one.
That equals just as much as three legs.
Linda, I called you a thousand times.
I've lost my keys.
This is Jasse.
And this is Sara, my little sister.
Hi.
Hi.
And you are…
-Have you not told her about me? -Yes.
He lives in my flat.
And he's my boyfriend.
We've been together for four years.
Yes.
Except for when you moved in with that girl from yoga.
Mentally, I was with you.
You were.
You can be with someone physically, but send your energy to someone else.
You can?
-Yes, you can. -But it wasn't easy for me.
Linda, when are you coming home?
It's not good for me to be alone.
How old is he?
I'll be 39 in two weeks.
In two weeks.
You can take my keys. Here.
-Do you need money as well? -You're giving him money?
-Can I borrow 2,000? -Sure.
It's for a course I'd like to take.
For people who've been hurt by love.
-It's called Wounded Warriors. -"Wounded Warriors"?
-Sara. -Yes?
Okay.
Oh my God, so much negative energy.
-She just buried her husband. -You can still be friendly.
I miss you.
I miss you too.
Are you coming home soon?
As soon as the baby arrives.
Who are you texting?
Just Jasse.
He's really into oral sex.
I mean, giving it.
I think he learnt it on some course. He…
He's lying there, and when he's finished, he looks up like this.
Like he wants praise or something. I just think he looks like
a dog at his water bowl.
But he's actually very kind and considerate.
I think he was just
having a bad day today. He…
He's a good guy.
Why do you always do that?
Make excuses for people?
Not everyone is nice. It's okay to not like someone.
-But I do like him. -That's what I mean. You're just stupid.
What? Surely you like people too?
You like… You love Eliot.
But that's completely different. He's a child.
-You love them even when you hate them. -Okay.
Daniél?
You loved Daniél.
It wasn't planned when I got pregnant with Eliot.
And Daniél…
didn't want to have children. At least not then.
Do you know what he said when I told him?
"This is the worst thing you ever could've said."
And even though he regretted saying it…
I think we gave each other a life that neither of us wanted.
-You're angry with me. -What?
You're angry with me.
But I'm here now because I want to help you.
With Eliot and anything else you need. I…
I want to be here for you, but you have to stop being angry with me.
-Ow! -You're my big sister.
Yes, but you can't hit me!
Hey!
Ow! You're not allowed to hit me either!
Stop it! Stop it!
-You stop it! -No, you stop it!
No.
Stop it!
You could've stayed with me and Mum after the divorce, but you didn't.
You moved in with him.
You were old enough to choose for yourself but I was only 10,
and I missed you, dammit.
He would've been all alone.
So what? He was an adult, and he didn't give a shit!
And it was all damn well his fault anyway!
You need to get it into your skull that sometimes people are just assholes,
and the only thing to do is leave!
No, I didn't mean now.
Here.
Dad had it, but I thought you should have it instead.
He does care, Sara.
And I think you should see him before it's too late.
Tiny, I promise you can count on me.
Sara?
Good night.
Good night.
Could he pass for a robot wrapped in this?
Sure.
I'd forgotten they're doing Halloween at preschool today.
I can drop him off, if you want.
No, no need.
Actually, I was going to ask you if you could maybe pick him up today.
I need to see the midwife and preschool closes at 2 pm.
I could drop him off and pick him up.
Or I just call and say he's sick.
-I'm ready! -Oh.
You look great. Are you…
I'm Uncle Linda.
-Do I have a moustache? -Yes.
Trick or treat?
-I don't have any candy. -Trick it is.
-No. -Yes.
No!
Hey, you.
Hey, you're so naughty. Are you naughty?
-Bye, sweetie. -Bye.
Bye.
-You know that turtle? -Yeah?
They're actually slow, but in the film, it's really fast.
-Fast like this? -No, like this!
I'll take that.
Let's see.
-Could you lie down? -Mm.
There.
-Do you feel okay? -Yes.
Let's see how the little one's getting on.
Or should I say "her"?
-You know it is a girl, right? -Yes.
-Okay. Could you lift your top? -Yes.
I'll just undo this.
I'm going to feel for the head. Breathe in.
And breathe out.
Breathe out.
There we have it. Okay.
Now let's see if we can find the heart.
This will feel a bit cold.
Let me feel.
I have to search a bit.
There we go. There it is.
Can you hear it?
It sounds like she is very healthy.
Okay.
Here you go.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I'd forgotten you were in there.
I'm sorry.
Hello?
Hi.
Where's Linda?
She's gone.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
She didn't come.
What happened? Where's Linda?
Eliot, sweetie. I'm just going to talk to your mum. I'll be right back.
-I'm not going anywhere. -Okay.
Come on.
Linda never showed up. He thought she was dead.
The preschool couldn't get hold of you, so they called me instead.
It's like I said, Linda is irresponsible. You can't trust her.
I've been comforting him for an hour.
Events like this leave deep scars. As a psychologist, I see it all the time.
Hi.
I tried calling you. Why didn't you answer?
Where have you been?
I'm sorry. I was with Dad.
It was only supposed to be a flying visit, but when I got there, he'd run away.
We looked everywhere.
And I got really scared that something had happened to him.
He could've walked straight out into traffic.
But then we found him. He's fine and everything's okay.
Eliot thought you were dead.
But I'm not.
I can go in and talk to him.
I just want to tell him I'm not dead.
Just go. Helen was right. This was a big mistake.
Tiny, Eliot can't go through life thinking people have died
just because they're five minutes late.
But people do. People die!
Everyone just abandons you. You can't trust anyone.
Everyone lets you down and you have to do everything yourself!
You promised you would be with me and Eliot.
You promised, and then you chose him! You choose him over me again!
Mummy? Where's Uncle Linda?
She's at home sleeping in her own bed.
-With Zlatan? -With Zlatan.
-Shall we get rid of that? -No.
I don't think you should sleep with it.
I miss Uncle Linda.
Straight line.
You're not straight.
Straight, straight.
Zlatan!
Hello?
Hi, it's Helen García. Have you spoken to Sara? Do you know where she is?
-No, I've got no idea where she is. -Oh. Any idea where she might be?
-We haven't spoken since-- -Never mind.
-Okay. -Bye.
Okay. Bye. Bye.
-What are you doing here? -We were taking a walk.
Sara went into labour last night.
She went to see the midwife this morning.
-She was four centimetres dilated. -Okay.
So they admitted her.
The ward just called. She's disappeared.
I should've realised she wasn't doing so well.
It's my fucking job, goddammit.
I'll have to get the car and look for her.
Where the hell are my keys?
Here.
Maybe Zlatan can find her?
Search, Zlatan. Zlatan, search!
-Where's Sara? Zlatan! -Are you coming, or what?
Yeah, sure.
-Can you keep that thing down? -Zlatan, lie down.
Lie down. Lie down!
What do you feed him?
Sorry.
I can't stop thinking about this thing with Eliot.
I know I'm not much of a big sister.
Sure you are.
I am the eldest. I'm supposed to take care of Sara, but I don't know how.
But Tiny knows. She's always known exactly what to do. Everything.
My therapist says I haven't been particularly helpful to the two of you
as you try to reconnect with each other.
That I may have come across as hostile.
-You're seeing a therapist? -Yes.
-I thought you were a therapist. -Yes, but we're only human.
-Okay. -It's part of our job.
He said it's important to have safe places and safe people when you're in crisis.
You're probably one of those.
Despite not having had any contact.
Oh, Sara…
Sara!
-Helen… -Sara!
Helen? I think I know where she might be.
Turn right here.
Why would she come here?
-We used to play here when we were young. -What? Why?
Stop there.
-Here? -Let's just check. Come.
-Thank goodness! -Here.
Should I take him?
Sara?
Are you having a swing?
I can't.
Okay.
Come on, let's go back to the hospital.
I don't want to.
But…
But you're about to give birth.
Your little girl is coming now.
I dreamt I gave birth to Daniél.
What if she looks like Daniél?
Don't all newborns just look like boiled potatoes?
What if…
What if she turns out just like him?
Talks like him, acts like him, says the same things.
Is just like him.
I couldn't bear it.
Neither of us resemble our parents, do we?
-Yes, we do. -No, you're nothing like Mum.
I didn't mean Mum.
I'm like Dad!
-I'm just like him. -Come on, Sara.
I am like him.
I'm just as selfish as him.
I'm just as impatient and bitter about life.
You're also kind and funny, just like Dad.
I push everyone away, just like he does.
And now I'm alone, just like him.
But I'm not like Mum, am I?
You're kind to everyone.
You're insecure and afraid of conflict.
You're with a man who treats you like shit.
No, you're nothing like Mum…
It's okay.
I'm like Mum.
I liked Mum.
I liked her too.
I miss her.
Me too.
Oh. Okay.
There, there.
There.
Push.
Just three more contractions, and she'll be out.
-You're doing great. -Something's wrong. I can feel it.
You're doing fine, Sara. I can feel the head now. Not long now.
-Alarm! -Sounding the alarm.
The baby's heart isn't beating as it should. She needs to come out now.
Okay, come now.
Sound the alarm.
Let's run.
Sonja?
-Why don't you sit down, Helen? -Yes.
I'm probably just a bit nervous.
I'm scared.
Me too.
I thought the worst had already happened.
With Daniél.
But it hasn't.
Grandma!
Elliot, hi.
They've taken her for an emergency C-section.
You can come in now and see mother and daughter. And little sister.
Come on.
Come on, Linda.
Oh dear.
Goodness, she's so cute.
Hello, little sister.
One, two, three, four, five, six…
…eight, nine, seven.
Six. Six!
Do you want to hold her?
Can I?
There you go.
Hi, sweetie.
-I've missed you. -Me too.
-She's beautiful. -Yes.
Thank you.
I have to go do something.
Mummy?
Hiya.
Linda?
What's going on?
You can't be with someone and send your mental energy to someone else.
What's going on?
You can't be with someone and send your mental energy to someone else.
Get that out of here.
I love you.
-This doesn't feel good. -I'm touching you.
-But, Linda… -Goodbye.
Hi.
I know you're going to be very angry now,
but I also know you'll be happy later.
-Maybe you won't be happy later-- -What are you talking about?
Today is a good day.
Is that your little girl?
Yes.
-Hello, little Sara. -Her name's Saga.
I was only joking.
Funny.
But she…
looks like you, Tiny.
There, Dad. I took a picture for you.
Shall we have some pizza?
Maybe the two of you should…
get some rest.
That's a good idea. I'll put these here.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Linda!
Dad, wait here.
-I wanted to ask you when you'll be home. -Home?
I mean here.
[woman on phone] It's Saturday morning, honey.
Is it him?
News desk in London says he flew in from Heathrow last night.
My guy at the British consulate said he's not staying there, so…
[Jae] Those two on the door, they're Epstein's.
Those three guys,
I've seen them before.
Royal protection officers. If they're here--
Jae, the door.
[woman gasps] Guards.
[Jae] It's like she wasn't even there.
She must have been coming for years.
[woman] Christ.
She can't be more than 20 now.
Yeah.
Here we go.
-[camera clicking] -It's Epstein.
-[woman] That's him. That's Andrew. -[Jae] Come on, turn around.
-What? -[woman groans]
-[grunts] -Go, go, go!
What a lovely day.
Oh, here we are.
Okay.
Uh… okay. Okay.
-This isn't gonna work. -[woman] What isn't?
Change of plan.
[woman] Jae, talk to me.
I'm improvising.
Bear with me.
Oh God.
-Jae? -Not now.
Jae, are you there?
I'm here. [panting]
♪ I gotta fly once ♪ ♪ I gotta try once ♪

[woman] Welcome, everybody.
I want to thank you all for taking the time out of your lunch.
All of us at the BBC face some incredible challenges.
Morning, George.
♪ Who told you You're allowed to rain on my parade? ♪
The world is changing.
We need to change with it.
Every year the BBC faces more and more competition in the news space,

Bloody dog!
Have we still got jobs, then?
Moody, stop begging! Come on.
Come here. Moody!
[newswoman] Never in my career have I felt BBC News is under as much threat as it is today.
It is our duty to respond.
So it is with great sadness
that I have to announce… some job losses.
We currently estimate these job cuts
to be in the region of 450.
Here we go. Here we fucking go.
I know it is an enormous number.
How to improve your news-gathering.
Sack all the journalists.
These cuts will be across all news departments.
And across all shows.
Thank you very much.
-Okay. Uh, focus. -[song ends]
We've heard what she had to say, and unless I missed it,
she didn't say anything about not doing our show.
-Well, that was bleak. -Manage to catch it? Did you?
Nine hours and 13 minutes from now,
we're on air. With what?
[woman] Follow-up on British arms sold to the Saudis being used in Yemen.
Yeah, we've covered that. What's the hook? Why today?
[man] Brexit. Fifteen rounds with Farage. One-on-one with Emily.
What would be our way in with Farage? Something new.
-[man] Frictionless borders. -Gets my juices going every time.
-I can get us Lupita for tonight. -The actress? Has she got a film out?
No. She wants to talk colorism. She's got a lot to say.
She's great. It's an exclusive. I think we should open with it.
Perfect for the second half. Can't open with her.
Agreed. They don't decide our running order.
We opened with Emma Thompson on Weinstein. They saw that. That's why they want us.
Weinstein was a news story that day. Lupita may well be great, but it isn't news.
Second half.
So, Farage? Sam? Can you book him?
If you want Farage, Freddy, then it's simple.
You call up his PR. It's really not rocket science.
He'll be straight over.
[Freddy] That's your job. You're our booker.
And you do know we've just announced a few hundred redundancies.
Uh, okay, let's, uh--
The way I keep my job… Freddy, is by booking the people we can't just call up.
The ones other people can't just get.
The job where you waltz in late, then spend the morning
working out where to go for lunch with Piers Morgan? Last in, first out.
-You were here at 6:00. On the pips. Yeah? -What?
You know what that does? That puts us 16 hours behind the news cycle,
while I go out and find stories people actually care about.
No, we love Lupita, and we desperately want her.
We'd like to close with her and go huge on socials.
You know, that's where this really cuts through.
Okay, that's great.
Great!
Thanks, you're a superstar. Okay, bye.
It's not about me.
This is about
putting you wonderful young entrepreneurs
together with you
eh… slightly more mature investors.
So that together with Pitch@Palace,
we can make magic happen.
Now, I know you're all desperate to get talking to them,
and they're desperate to listen to your ideas
and make them into a reality.
So the best thing for me to do is to get out of the way
and let you crack on.
Before I do…
Don't tell my mum.
Maybe for the best no one came.
[Andrew] Ah, there we are.
All right, now say Pitch@Palace.
[all] Pitch@Palace!
Pitch@Palace!
Uh… I'd like it to be fair.
I mean, you don't mention Epstein
every time there's a story about Bill Clinton, do you?
[man] Bill Clinton isn't the Queen's favorite son.
[sighs] And if you had been here, then you would have seen for yourself
the… the wonderful job that… that he does with Pitch,
encouraging young entrepreneurs.
How young? These entrepreneurs? How young is young?
Piss off, Nick.
How do they get away with this?
That is why we have hired Jason. To manage this.
Time.
-It takes time. -Time? That photograph is nine years old.
-Sir, just-- -No.
-No quick fix to a story like this. -So you people keep telling me.
[Jason] And you are 100% right,
Your Royal Highness.
About what?
You've been dealing with this Epstein mess for nearly a decade.
You haven't seen him in that time, correct?
Uh… No. No, um… No, absolutely. It was, um…
Uh… December 2010.
Then my instinct is… you haven't had the right strategy.
Epstein, and the whole… Playboy Prince thing,
should have been put to bed a long time ago.
And I can make it go away.
But you have to let me control it.
Amanda?
Well, uh, Jason knows the press.
That's why we hired him.
I think he can help us.
I've, uh, put together a list of friendly journalists.
That's a… contradiction in terms, innit?
Invite them here, one by one, for tea.
They feel special.
You get to know each other, all off the record,
and slowly they realize you're a decent human being,
who is, by the way,
prepared to acknowledge errors of judgment.
Slowly.
It's always slowly. Always time.
I'm 60 next year.
And my mother, well…
none of us are getting any younger.
Jason's list of journalists.
What?
[sighs] Well, this…
This list. This… strategy.
We've been down this road before.
-Hello? -[Amanda] Hello, Sam.
It's Amanda Thirsk from the Duke of York's office.
Hi.
But we don't do red lines.
No questions off the table.
-Maybe just think on it. -I'll get back to you.
Great. Speak soon.
-[woman] Anything good? -Not sure. The Palace.
-Right, what have we got? -You know what I think?
For intelligent analysis, we're the only place in town.
Brexit again.
Sam, didn't you have something? The Palace?
Uh, not for tonight. But we have Lupita.
Great. Which bit of the Palace?
-Prince Andrew's private secretary. -Okay, what do they want?
Pitch@Palace. It's like The Apprentice,
only you get Prince Andrew instead of Donald Trump.
-It's not on television-- -Not Newsnight, is it?
Do you know Andrew's PS?
-No. -Did she reach out to you first?
[Sam] Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, everyone, keep looking, and let's talk again in an hour.
[Sam] I need a connect.
Uh, Jae Donnelly. A pap. Based in New York. Do you know him?
Great.
God… For Christ's sake.
Farage isn't available. We need somebody else.
Maybe even he's bored with it by now. Give me a minute.
-Who's on the phone? -Photographer.
Working for who? Paparazzi?
All your favorites, Freddy. The Sun. The Mail.
For Christ's sake.
[Sam] You know what? If we had half the instincts
and a quarter of the contacts for the average tabloid pap,
maybe we wouldn't be scrabbling around
for new ways to have the same argument every night.
So just, you know, leave it with me, yeah?
Coming right up.
Someone… Someone for Emily to really tell off.
-All the dinner parties in North London… -Sam.
-…say, "Did you see Newsnight last night? -Sam.
"Wasn't it amazing how Emily Maitlis said all the great things we all agree with?"
We're mistaking talking to ourselves for news, Freddy, and it's killing us.
-Stewart. -Mm?
I'm heading down to the studio.
-Come! Moody! -[dog whimpers]
I behave like that… insulting people in front of the entire office,
I mean, am I still here? Do I still have a job?
We have an issue
with Sam.
We? Who's we?
[scoffs] Well, I do,
Freddy, and now possibly Emily.
I'm not a snob, but she's very Daily Mail.
I'm not saying we can't cope with different opinions,
but she is…
she's too defensive.
[woman] Put the lights up a touch.
It's too cold.
I didn't say "turn back down."
[tech] Sure, but this is the correct set level for broadcast.
I'm aware of that. Back up.
Thanks for coming, Sam.
That level but warmer.
[tech] All right, okay.
I'll just have to switch some things around.
You understand the pressure we're under?
All of us. I've got enough fights on my hands
without having them in my own team.
Maybe you should speak with--
I am speaking to them, and I'm saying to them the same thing I'm saying to you.
-Help me out. -What about something like that?
Warmer, much warmer.
I'm trying to make changes. I want a broader audience.
That's how we survive. I've no interest in echo chambers.
I want different voices. I want tension.
And passion.
-Look, Emily, I'm sorry. -No, you're not.
You meant every word.
Not every word.
Don't think I don't know what people think about me.
The point is, if we're at each other's throats,
then none of this is going to work.
[tech] So what are we saying?
No, warmer.
Okay, stop there.
-I like it. -[tech] Great.
Okay, understood. Anything else?
-I-- -[Emily] Three women and a whippet.
You wouldn't have seen that in a BBC studio when I started.
-[girl] Oh my God, n-- -Oh my God, that is--
-No, no, no, no, no! -No, no, no, no!
Sorry about the noise. I'm working. I might have to go without saying goodbye.
Thanks for calling me back. Anything good?
A Kardashian launching a new pair of knickers.
Gotta pay the bills.
-[chuckles] -All right, check your messages.
Some photos of girls I've taken over the years at Epstein's.
They are in there about an hour each.
They look very young.
[Jae] They come from an apartment block on 66th Street
owned by Epstein's brother, rented by Jeffrey.
It's a warehouse of girls.
He calls them his "nubiles."
This is still happening?
It's industrial, Sam.
I've been in New York for years.
All I have to do is spend 24 hours outside of that place,
and you see them come and go.
How do we not know about this?
Because it's young girls no one cares about
going in and out of a house.
And he's rich.
You know, he went to jail. Now he's out. Frankly, hardly anyone gives a shit.
And Andrew, is he in there often?
-Oh, back in the day, sure. -Any proof?
Of Andrew actually at Epstein's?
Other than the park picture?
Uh… no.
No, they're careful.
But I can promise you he was there.
-You know about Ghislaine Maxwell, right? -[clamoring]
-Andrew's friend? -No.
Well, you should. I've gotta go. Ghislaine. Look her up. I'll be in touch.
Well, you should. I've gotta go. Ghislaine. Look her up. I'll be in touch. Thanks.
-[girl 1] Guys. -[girl 2] What?
-[girl 1] Look at this. -[girl 3] Let me see.
[woman] Sam. Leave him a minute.
-A what? -[softly] Writing a poem.
Lucas?
So who is she?
I'm not in her class.
Listen, I… I know I'm your mum, and I'm biased and everything,
but you're very handsome, so you shouldn't--
No. Oh my. I mean my actual class.
-She's in the year above. -Oh. Well, I like your ambition. [laughs]
-[man] Chili sauce, yeah? The usual? -Yes, please.
You want a tip? How to talk to girls?
-Do I have a choice? -Not really, no.
You listen. Most people want to talk.
But most people are terrible at listening.
But you promised the British people there wouldn't be an issue.
And at the time, I followed that through--
-Were you wrong at the time? -I don't accept that.
Well, you were either wrong or making a promise you couldn't keep.
Which is it?
You described yourself as a man of principle.
You also guaranteed voters that border checks between the UK and EU
would be unaffected by Brex--
[Jae] Hi, this is Jae Donnelly. Leave a message.
Hi, Jae. It's Sam.
Uh… this photo of… Andrew
with Ghislaine Maxwell in London
and a girl, 17 at the time…
Uh, 2001. Virginia Roberts. Do you know anything about it?
Um… Give me a call when you get this. Thanks.
Bloody hell.
[woman] I want a selfie.
[chuckles] Okay. Okay.
And a spoon.
Okay, bye.
-[driver] Don't tell me. -What?
Is it Phil the Greek?
Jugface?
I can't say.
It can't be Her Majesty. Her flag's not up.
Well, just as long as it's not that Randy fucking Andy.
Here we go.
Thanks.
-Hello. Morning. -Morning.
Yeah.
-Okay. -Thank you.
Follow the path. They'll let you in at the top.
Okay, great. Thanks.
[man] Good afternoon.
[Amanda] Earl Grey or chamomile?
[Amanda] We lose a fair few.
-Teaspoons. -[both chuckle]
They just seem to
go.
It's seen as a good thing.
-It means everybody wants a part of us. -Us?
[inhales] Well, I've been here for a long time.
It's like family. The day we don't need to budget for extra teaspoons…
And… would he be prepared to talk about that?
The theft of teaspoons from Buckingham Palace?
The future of the monarchy. What it will mean when the Queen dies.
[quietly] We don't talk about that.
Too painful? For a favorite son?
One thing about Her Majesty,
she is a very good judge of character.
So… what's she like?
-Who? -Emily.
Oh, well, she runs… [chuckles] She swims, she interviews.
She swims, she interviews.
Nobody's ever seen her eat. She's Superwoman.
-And the Bic. -Harry Potter has his wand.
Emily Maitlis has her Bic.
And Andrew? How's his judge of character?
He's a… a very loyal friend.
Too loyal for his own good sometimes.
Ghislaine Maxwell.
-She was a good friend, yes. -Mm-hmm.
Straight to the point.
There was some small talk,
but we're both busy women, and we both know why we're here, Amanda.
[whispers] Do you want to get a real drink?
Amanda?
Amanda?
Uh… she's out.
With Sam McAlister.
Who?
What do you think you know about me, Sam?
I know you come from banking.
A single mum.
I know that you've been doing this job for seven years,
and you have a problem that won't go away.
And I know that you're here
and Jason Stein isn't.
So?
So maybe it's you who wants to do things differently.
Or we're just looking at options.
-Or that. -[both laugh]
Uh…
Sorry, it's Andrew. He needs me.
Um, I'm only trying to be honest with you, Amanda.
I always am.
And you know it can't just be Pitch.
And like I said before, you wouldn't be here talking to Newsnight
if you didn't already know that.
[inhales sharply] But I'm not talking to Newsnight, Sam.
I'm talking to you.
And there is a red line.
Thank you for meeting.
[Andrew] You'll like this too. This is moments
[Andrew] You'll like this too. This is moments after I've just narrowly been missed by inches by an Exocet missile.
after I've just narrowly been missed by inches by an Exocet missile.
And as soon as it came, I'd… Out of the way, and I'd come down. I'd do that two times a day.
Out of the way, and I'd come down. I'd do that two times a day.
[woman] Must have been terrifying moments.
Oh, some of the worst.
And some of the best.
Those… Those… Those men, they… they-they really knew me, you know?
Well, there's no hiding in war.
From your shipmates. Um…
From yourself.
Do you ever miss it?
What, war?
The Argies were a lot less trouble than your lot.
Come on. Let's go for it. Let's do the tour.
[Jason] Newsnight? Newsnight?!
You saw that.
Can't… Can't you see how good he is with people?
How they like him when they spend time with him?
-That's the plan, Amanda. -Look, it's called charm.
Jason, you have to be in the room with it to feel it.
Television?
Look, it was just a meeting.
A meeting you shouldn't have taken.
Especially without me.
This is my job.
No, not now, Freddy.
-Did the liquid lunch go on the BBC tab? -[sighs] I was so close.
Really? Think you have special powers over a big beast like Buckingham Palace Comms?
It was just the two of us. Nobody else.
-And we were so close. -To what?
An interview. This Epstein story isn't going away.
Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's girlfriend, is one of Andrew's oldest friends.
Then they're not gonna talk to us about it, are they?
Sam, it's celebrity fluff, not Newsnight.
[Sam] It's not fluff. It's exactly what we should be doing.
I'm sorry, but we don't have time for you to spend
a whole day chasing a story that we're never gonna get. Not anymore.
We're meant to be a team. Why do you think you're so special?
This is the work.
All right? Today was the work because this story is only going to get bigger.
And when it does, we don't wanna be the first people making the call.
We wanna be the first people they call. And if I--
If I can't do my job the way it needs to be done,
then I don't think I can do this anymore.
Oh, Sammy.
[automated voice] Please leave a message after the tone.
Hi, Esme. It's Sam.
I was just calling…
Uh, could you…
Could you call me back when you get this? It's important. Thanks, bye.
You all right?
D'you know, I spend half my time
just absolutely terrified of getting sacked,
and the rest of it wishing they'd get it over with.
Why don't they see me as one of them?
-Maybe there's somewhere easier. -I don't want it to be easy, Mum. I just…
I just want it to matter.
[inhales] Lucas!
-Mmm… Night-night. -Night-night. Night-night. [kisses]
-Night, you. -Night.
Hello.
I spoke to her. Freya. That's her name.
Yeah. And what did she say? What did you say?
-Hello. -[chuckles]
What did she say?
Well, I thought maybe she hadn't heard me. But she did. And--
-[musical ringtone playing] -Yeah. Oh, one minute, darling. Wait.
-[musical ringtone playing] -Yeah. Oh, one minute, darling. Wait. One second. Hang on.
Jae?
How was the Palace?
I couldn't make it work. Epstein's a no-go.
Well, not anymore.
-What do you mean? -I'm at Teterboro. A private airfield.
Our friend Jeffrey's plane is due to land in the next hour.
And the FBI are waiting.
-Mum! Can you… -[car alarm chirps]
Can you stay one more hour with Lucas? That all right?
-Yeah, of course. -I'll be back before he goes to bed.
[Sam's mum] Take your time. See you later.
Hello?
You called me.
You said it was important.
Jeffrey Epstein is being arrested tonight. Sex trafficking.
Esme? Are you there?
So it's a news story now.
Right, let's start pushing the Palace.
Thanks.
All right.
Everything's changed.
Any moment now, you are going to get a phone call.
After that, a hundred more.
We have a few hours, at best, before the tsunami hits.
-I thought we could use it, both of us. -What has changed?
The FBI are raiding Jeffrey Epstein's home any moment now.
This red line of yours isn't going to hold, Amanda.
You can't go "no comment" on being friends with a pedophile
and expect everyone to love you, whoever you are.
-How do I know I can trust you? -You don't.
And you don't have to because I can give you an hour.
Yeah? And then it's up to him. Not you.
Yeah? And then it's up to him. Not you. Not me. Him.
An hour of television can change everything.
It's like magic.
[newswoman] US financier Jeffrey Epstein has been arrested today
on federal sex trafficking charges.
The disgraced billionaire has been accused of trafficking dozens of underage girls.
He was previously convicted in 2008
after pleading guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution.
How many times?
…will no doubt focus on Mr. Epstein's friendship…
How many times?
…the Duke of York, who previously claimed to have cut…
I'm sorry.
…all ties with Epstein in 2010.
Where does he go? Simple question, where does he go?
A clue.
He's a marsupial.
Roo. As in Kanga.
Put them together. What do you get?
-Rookanga. -Oh, go away.
Go away!
They have acknowledged the duke's friendship with Mr. Epstein in the past.
They have acknowledged the duke's friendship with Mr. Epstein in the past. They state that…
[Sam] If the prime minister needs to get this message across to voters,
you're going to need to send us someone people have actually heard of,
who can form sentences using more than just single-syllable… words…
…now has the very latest news.
The investigation surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's arrest
three weeks ago for child sex offenses
has today widened to include his friend Prince Andrew, the Duke of York,
as previously suppressed documents from a case in 2015 come to light.
Virginia Giuffre, 17 at the time of the allegations,
claims in newly released documents that she had sex with the Duke of York
on three separate occasions.
Twice in London, and once in Mr. Epstein's home in New York.
[female reporter] While Buckingham Palace continue to deny
these latest allegations against the Duke of York,
Virginia Giuffre told reporters outside a court in Manhattan…
It's not true.
I mean, none of it is true.
-…the deepening crisis surrounding Andrew… -[scoffs]
The morning I went away to boarding school…
Mummy combed my hair.
It was one of those tortoiseshell combs. Remember those?
I can feel it now, scraping across my head.
It hurt, but I… [sighs]
But I didn't want it to stop.
So Jason says… n-nothing changes.
We… hold our nerve.
Is that what you think?
Let's see how it plays out.
I'm supposed to be talking to Mummy about my 60th birthday.
She's got big plans.
[anchor 1] Mr. Epstein, arrested just over a month ago,
was found dead this morning
in his cell at the Metropolitan…
[anchor 2] He once counted among his friends Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew…
[anchor 3] He was in cardiac arrest and pronounced dead…
[anchor 4] …charged on trafficking dozens of girls for sex…
-[anchor 5] …six underage victims… -[anchor 6] …involving underage girls…
[anchor 7] …including Donald Trump, liked beautiful women…
[anchor 8] …categorically denied by the royal family.
[Esme] All across the world, every paper, every show on every news channel,
this is the story. The only story.
-Morning. -Morning.
Sam, I want it for us.
For Newsnight.
You got your foot in the door before anyone else.
[Sam] Amanda. Hi, it's Sam McAlister.
Please call me.
When you're ready to talk, we're here.
Her Majesty combing your hair on your last morning at home…
Yes?
[Amanda] You remembering it and talking about it…
Yes?
[Amanda] I think there's a reason for that.
I think you want your future back.
We both do.
Let me help you.
[man on TV] …relationship with Epstein will persist.
Now, of course, the duke, the Palace are desperate to move on from this issue,
but with today's news,
the prospect of that seems further away than ever.
No commitments, no promises.
-[Esme] But? -They've agreed to meet.
Right. This stays in this room, just the four of us.
If it leaks that we're even meeting, they could get spooked.
Sam, whatever you need, it's yours.
Actually, there was one thing. I think it will help a lot.
[Esme] Name it.
Emily.
I've never been smuggled into a palace before.
[Stewart] Keep it light.
-[Sam] Mm. -We don't scare him off.
We, uh… we play nice.
Be respectful.
Relax, I've got this.
How difficult can it be talking to the Queen's son
about his friendship with a convicted sex offender?
Good morning.
[Andrew] Hello, everyone.
I hope you don't mind, I brought someone along.
-Hello. -You know my daughter Beatrice.
Hello.
[Emily] I can't tell you what the questions will be
because I don't know myself yet.
But when I do know…
I still won't tell you.
But… they will be fair.
And no "gotchas," I promise.
"Will be"?
"Would be," I think you mean.
Were we to agree to do this.
And Pitch@Palace?
We'll discuss that, of course.
But… you know as well as I do,
that's not why we're here.
Epstein.
This is about honesty.
On both sides.
If I do an interview, it will only be one.
Uh, the question is, why you?
-[Emily] Stewart? -Well, um, Newsnight is forensic.
Um, it's tough, but never sensational. And so is Emily.
-And she's a woman. -And she's a woman.
And she's here.
Look, in my position,
with everything that's been, um… said,
and with the world as it is now, I…
It's hard to imagine how I can turn it around. Frankly. I mean…
It's hard to imagine how I can turn it around. Frankly. I mean… I… I have a lot of people telling me it's a mistake even being in this room.
[Sam] And yet here you are.
And I can promise you one thing.
You can't turn it around by staying silent.
You know how people see you, don't you?
Why don't you… spell it out?
Randy Andy.
Air Miles Andy.
This is sex, and girls,
and planes and private islands and money.
And, with respect, the public see these stories,
and they think, "Yep, I can believe that."
This isn't bad for your brand.
This is your brand.
"With respect"?
Sort of got a point. [laughs]
[Sam] Listen, I get it.
"Never complain, never explain." But I'm afraid those days are over.
Yes, everyone has a voice now.
Social media. Facebook.
Twitter. Everyone's having their say,
and what they're saying about you
is a lot… stronger than anything I just said.
-Have you seen Twitter? -No, I don't, uh, pay attention to that.
[Beatrice] I do.
A lot worse than what she said.
So I'm just saying that's the story,
and it doesn't change
unless you change it,
unless you tell us a different story.
Your story.
In your voice.
[Emily] Sam's right.
I mean,
I might not have said it quite so bluntly, but…
I don't understand why everyone's obsessed with my friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.
I knew Jimmy Savile so much better.
Thank you very much. Very nice to meet you.
Um, should we pop up and say hello to Mummy before the Commonwealth banquet?
Never ends, does it?
Um, Amanda will be in touch, one way or another.
-[Emily] Her mummy or his mummy? -[Sam] Fergie's not here.
She's abroad.
-So his mummy. -Okay, wow. Bloody hell.
Mummy might block it.
Yeah.
Christ, I'm tired.
Pretty punchy in there, Sammy. Nice work.
[Jason] Conditions, Amanda?
You… You discussed conditions.
I… I didn't agree to anything.
It… It's not like that.
Amanda.
What conditions?
The only thing that matters is that he is given the space to talk to us.
"Us"?
The nation.
Oh my God.
I can't do this.
-Mm. -No.
I'm out.
I understand.
If they agree, and if it happens,
it's 60 minutes.
"If it happens"? What could stop us?
Something high up. This is the royal family and the BBC.
People start talking about the national interest and make no mistake,
if we get this, and we pull it off, it will be front page of every paper.
But if we get it wrong, if we make mistakes,
if we don't get the tone right,
the story won't be him. It'll be us.
No, it won't.
It'll be me.
She's always right, isn't she?
Always.
What did she say?
She trusts my judgment.
[Sam] Great.
Amanda Thirsk called.
Thursday, 2:00 p.m. The Palace.
We're on.
Got 70 hours. Emily, you're spending them with me.
Stewart, you're producing. Sam, anyone who needs you, gets you.
Yes, is Fran there?
Yes, extremely urgent.
With the director-general? Which opera?
[Fran] When it's done,
nobody sees the cut until the DG and I have seen it.
Lovely to see you both.
Tony's keeping his options open.
Well, it's not over till the fat lady sings.
[Esme] So the question is,
what are we looking for?
A confession?
String of denials?
An apology?
No way he's confessing unless he wants to go to jail,
and we're not settling for an apology, so we go after him hard with the facts.
-Fine. So where do we start? -[Freddy] Mm.
July 15th, 2006. Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Harvey Weinstein
are at Beatrice's Victorian-themed 18th birthday party.
Epstein wore white with gold buttons and a chestful of medals.
His Florida home had just been raided by police.
Sorry, that's a lot to take in, in one go.
July 15th, 2006,
Epstein, Maxwell, and Harvey Weinstein
are all at Beatrice's Victorian-themed 18th birthday party.
Epstein wore white with gold buttons and a chestful of medals.
His Florida home had just been raided by police.
Sorry, that's a lot to take in, in one go.
That is fantastic. Nowhere to hide.
[Freddy] Andrew's tried to make it seem his friendship with Ghislaine
was the main reason he spent time with Epstein.
Problem is, it looks like she was absolutely complicit
in so much of what Epstein was doing.
This painting of Clinton… That's the Lewinsky dress.
[Freddy] Yep. Epstein had it on his wall.
There was a life-sized naked doll hanging from a chandelier.
A massage room.
Soap shaped like genitalia.
You couldn't be anywhere near Epstein and not know.
[Sam's mum] You know Lucas can stay here tonight if you have to work.
No, it's fine. They don't need me anyway.
I don't believe that for a second.
Then why didn't they ask me to stay, Mum?
I bring in the interview, and they still don't want me in the room.
Sam, you know how this works.
People like us, we don't wait to be asked.
We do what we have to do.
Did they ask you to go after Prince Andrew?
-No. -No, they didn't.
But you did.
Remember that.
And this interview,
does it matter?
Yeah, it matters.
Well, there you go, then.
Love you, Mum. [chuckles softly]
I love you too, sweetheart.
Hello.
[Amanda] Sam. Uh…
I hope it's not too early.
[Esme] And the 29th. And you've got, what, everything from the 17th of June?
[Freddy] That's right.
-Can you put those on a memory stick? -Yeah.
[Sam] Amanda called.
Is she pulling the plug?
South Drawing Room.
Two chairs in the middle of the floor. Six feet apart.
It's like a western.
Like a gunfight in a western.
-Right. -Huh.
All set?
[Esme] Emily.
What's wrong?
What if he just apologizes?
What if I lay out all the facts,
he doesn't admit to anything, but he does say sorry?
What if he's good, Esme?
Then it'll be great television.
Well, that's not why I'm doing it.
Well, why are you doing it?
Monica Lewinsky.
I feel like I let women down by not asking Clinton about her.
Sex with that woman was actually consensual.
She was 21. He was the president of the United States.
He got his life back. She got decades of vicious misogyny.
You push.
What?
If he's good, if he's saying sorry for what these girls went through,
then… lean in and ask him if he feels responsible as well as sorry.
[Emily] What if he says no?
Push again, with the photograph. Show him the picture. Here.
Here.
But this photograph… is you.
I don't believe I was ever there,
that I ever even went upstairs in that house.
Um… You don't recollect, Your Royal Highness.
Yes, of course.
So… it's a fake?
[Andrew] As I say,
I have no recollection of ever having been there
or even meeting that woman.
Ms. Roberts. Please don't ever say "that woman."
Ever.
-Oh, for heaven's sake. -I understand this is difficult.
And, of course,
you couldn't have been there on that date, correct?
You have denied, many times,
having even met Virginia Giuffre.
You have denied her extremely serious allegations
that she was forced to have sex with you
when she was just 17 years old.
Now, either this happened
or she's lying.
Which is it?
Bingo. Brilliant.
We got him.
Sam.
Tell me.
Nothing.
Tell me.
I'm going in there. You're not.
If you have something to say, I want to hear it.
It's just we offered him… space and time.
We offered him an interview.
Men like that hate it when they're not heard.
He'll want to be heard.
So the really big question… is what do I wear?
Black dress.
Simple, elegant.
Hepburn/Maitlis.
My knees.
You've got the best knees on TV.
I don't want people looking at my knees.
You don't want him looking at your knees. Actually, we do want him looking.
-That would be good TV. -[chuckling]
[Esme] Emily?
Go home.
I want you raring to go in the morning.
[Emily] 2006.
Epstein was convicted of trafficking girls as young as 14.
Yet you continued relations with him for another four years.
And yet you…
and yet you continued your friendship with him until 2010.
[panting] And yet you continued…
-[dog barks] -Moody!
That's great. Yeah, just in this room. All right. Through there.
Moody!
-ID, please, miss. -Yeah, um…
She's with me.
Thanks!
Thanks.
You chase them, you'll never catch them.
And then when they're ready to come, you won't be there.
He might walk out. If Emily's doing to him what I think, it's a strong possibility.
If he does, film it.
-Whatever he does, do not stop filming. -Stewart.
-Right. -Um…
Your Royal Highness.
[Andrew] Sure about this?
Little bit, um…
[woman] A bit of powder, Your Royal Highness?
-Sure. What's your name? -Cat.
-Okay? First question. -Yeah.
I want it to set the tone. Straight in. "Jeffrey Epstein was a child abuser."
"You knew that when you went to stay with him, didn't you?"
Only one answer to that. Already he's got nowhere to go.
[Andrew] No, this needs to be on the other side.
It's going through the opposite edge of the chair.
That way, it won't stick out.
-Oh God. -No, wait.
Let him be. We want him to be comfortable.
Trousers.
Just, uh…
Just… be yourself.
[Sam] That's not great.
Donal McCabe. He's from the Queen's press office.
[Stewart] We didn't agree to that, did we?
[Sam] With the Queen?
No. But by all means, take it up with her.
[woman] Sound speed.
[man] Set.
Your Royal Highness.
We've come to Buckingham Palace
in highly unusual circumstances.
Normally, we'd be discussing your work… -[Andrew] Mm. -…your duty.
We'll come on to that.
But today,
you've chosen to speak out for the first time.
Why have you decided to talk now?
Because there is no good time
to talk about, um… Mr. Epstein
and all things associated.
And we've been talking to Newsnight for some time
about, um, doing something around the work that I was doing.
And unfortunately, we've just not been able
to fit into either your schedule or my schedule until now… now.
Actually, it's a very good opportunity. I'm delighted to be able to see you today.
As you say,
it all goes back to your friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.
How did you first become friends?
How did you meet?
Well, I met through his girlfriend.
Back in 1999.
[whispers] It's too open. It's too easy.
[Andrew] I'd known Ghislaine since university. In the UK.
And, um, I didn't spend much time…
I suppose I saw him once or twice a year, perhaps maximum three times a year,
and… quite often, um, if I was in the United States and doing things,
and he wasn't there, he'd say,
"Why don't you come and use my houses?"
And I said, "Thank you very much indeed."
But it would be… a considerable stretch to say that we were very close friends.
But he had the most extraordinary ability
to, um… to bring… extraordinary people together.
And that's the bit that I remember.
It's going to dinner parties where you would meet…
What's she doing?
…academics, politicians…
She's letting him talk.
[Andrew] It was a cosmopolitan group of what I would call--
Did you trust him?
Yes, I think I probably did,
but, um…
Obviously, I don't go into… um, a friendship
looking for the… the wrong thing, if you understand what I mean.
I… I'm an engaging person.
I want to be able to engage.
Am I right in thinking you threw a birthday party
for Epstein's girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, at Sandringham?
No, it was a shooting weekend.
A shooting weekend?
Yes, just a straightforward… straightforward shooting weekend.
But during these times that he was a guest at Windsor Castle,
at Sandringham, this shooting weekend… Yep.
We now know… that he had been
We now know… that he had been procuring young girls… for sex trafficking.
We now know that.
At the time,
there was no indication,
to me… or anybody else,
that that's what he was doing.
Absolutely no indication.
Flight logs for Epstein's jet.
The, uh, quote "Lolita Express."
PA, Prince Andrew, is a frequent flyer.
So is BC, Bill,
and GM, Ghislaine Maxwell.
Princes, presidents, and females.
The girls don't get named.
Just so our ducks are in a row when all of Fleet Street comes knocking.
Just for the record, you've been on his private plane.
Yes.
You've been to stay on his private island.
Yes.
You've stayed at his home in Palm Beach.
Yes.
So, in 2006, in May,
an arrest warrant was issued for Epstein
for sexual assault of a minor.
Yes.
He was released in July of 2010.
And within months,
you went to stay with him at his New York mansion.
Why?
Why were you staying with a convicted sex offender?
Now, I went to see him with the sole purpose of saying to him
that because he had been convicted,
it was inappropriate that we should be seen together.
I felt that doing it over the telephone was the chicken's way of doing it.
I had to go and see him and talk to him.
I went to see him. We had an opportunity to go for a walk in the park,
and that was the… uh, conversation, coincidentally,
that was photographed.
When I… I said to him, I said, "Look, because of what has… happened,
I don't think it is appropriate for us to remain in contact."
And by mutual decision,
we agreed to part company, and I left.
He threw a party to celebrate his release,
and you were invited as a guest of honor.
No, I didn't go.
Oh, in 2010.
There… Well, there… There certainly wasn't a… a party
to celebrate his release in… December, because it was only a small dinner party.
There were only eight or ten of us at the dinner.
If there was a… a party,
then I know nothing about that.
You were invited to that dinner
as a guest of honor.
I was there, so I was at the dinner. I don't think it was as you might put it,
but, okay, I was there. I was there at a dinner.
I'm just trying to work this out
because you said you went to break up the relationship,
and yet you stayed at that New York mansion several days.
I'm wondering how long--
I was doing a number of other things while I was there.
But you were staying at the house of a convicted sex offender.
It was a convenient place to stay.
So I've spoken to Panorama.
Virginia Roberts says the original photo was printed and date stamped
two days after it was taken,
and we have an affidavit from a witness in 2001
who saw the photo at the time.
-Freddy? -Yeah?
Thank you.
Yeah.
[Emily] One of Epstein's accusers,
Virginia Roberts,
made allegations against you.
In a legal deposition,
she said she had sex with you three times.
Once in a London house
when she was trafficked to you in Maxwell's house.
Once… in New York
a month or so later in Epstein's mansion,
and once on his private island,
in a group of seven or eight other girls.
No. [scoffs]
No to all of it?
All of it.
Absolutely no to all of it.
Are you saying you don't believe her?
She's lying?
That's a difficult thing for me to, um… answer
because I don't know
what she's, um, trying to achieve.
But I can tell you…
uh… categorically,
I don't remember meeting her at all.
I do not remember a photograph being taken,
and I've said,
consistently and, um…
frequently,
that we never had any sort of sexual contact whatever.
She says she met you in 2001.
She says she dined with you,
danced with you.
You bought her drinks
at Tramp nightclub in London.
There's a number of things wrong with that story. One of which is that…
I don't know where the bar is in Tramps.
Um, I don't drink.
Um, I… I don't think I've ever bought a drink in Tramps whenever I was there.
Do you remember dancing with her?
No, that couldn't have happened because on that particular date,
I was, um, at home. I was with the children.
And I had taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking
for a party, I think… round about 4:00, 5:00 in the afternoon.
Why would you remember that so specifically?
Because going to Pizza Express in Woking
is an unusual thing for me to do.
A very unusual thing for me to do.
Uh, stop. Um…
Can… Can we?
Please, um, I would like to go back.
I would like to make a… a specific reference to the date.
March the 10th.
I think it's perfectly clear. Do we need that?
I think we're rolling well, don't you, Emily?
-No? -No.
-She was very specific about that night. -Mm-hmm.
She described dancing with you.
-No. -And you profusely sweating.
Um, there's a… there's a, um… a slight problem with the sweating.
But… because I have, um, a… peculiar condition,
which is that I don't sweat, or rather I didn't sweat at the time.
And that would, um… Oh, actually…
Yes, I didn't sweat at the time,
and that's because I suffered
what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War
when I was shot at, and I simply, um…
it… it… it was almost impossible for me to… to… to sweat.
I wonder
if you have any sense of
guilt, regret, or shame
about any of your behavior
in your friendship with Epstein.
On balance…
could I have avoided… ever meeting him?
I don't think so,
and that's because of my friendship with Ghislaine.
[sighs through lips] Do I regret the fact
that he's quite obviously, uh, conducted himself in a manner unbecoming…
[Emily] "Unbecoming"? He was a sex offender.
Yes, I'm sorry. I… I was being polite.
I mean, in the sense that he was a sex offender. But, no, um…
Was I right in having him as a friend?
At the time,
bearing in mind this was some years before he was accused of being a sex offender,
I don't think there was anything wrong… then.
The problem was, after the fact, that after he had been convicted…
-You stayed with him. -I stayed with him.
And that's the bit that, um, as it were,
I kick myself for on a daily basis. [chuckles]
Because that… it was… it was not, um, becoming of a member of the royal family,
and we… we try to uphold the highest standards and practices,
and I… I let the side down, simple as that.
Is there anything you feel has been left unsaid
that you would like to say now?
No, I don't think so.
You probably dragged out of me most of what's required.
I'm gonna go.
I have a biker downstairs. The memory cards. Both copies…
Now, would you all like a tour?
Some stills?
Ah. Yes, of course. Um… Tell you what, two birds, one stone.
You take your snaps while I show Emily around.
[distorted] Wasn't he wonderful?
[softly] Wonderful.
You know, I thought that all went very well.
Like a walk in the park.
Expecting a car, madam?
Uh… Uh, no. Thank you.
Um… I think I'm going to walk. But thank you.
-I think I might be sick. -[both chuckle]
Emily. That was…
That was him… right there. You did it.
We did it.
Thanks, Sammy.
[Stewart] How are we doing?
Twitter teasers are nearly ready. When do we go live?
[Stewart] I'm gonna talk to the DG about that now.
She had her man in the room when you shot the interview. He recorded it. Yes?
Could she stop it going out, Tony?
Well, she is the Queen. I mean, I'd have to take the call.
We want to trail it on Friday night after the show, live.
With Emily?
Of course. With teasers on socials afterwards.
[Tony] I'll tell the Palace we're broadcasting on Saturday night.
Wait for me to get back to you.
How long?
Fifteen minutes.
[Emily] I guess no news is good news.
-Tony? -Esme, hi.
Pull the trigger. We're on.
Tomorrow night, in a Newsnight special program,
we will hear for the first time from the duke himself.
In an unprecedented interview,
he speaks to us at length about his friendship with Epstein
and the claims made against him.
Prince Andrew, the Duke of York,
has long faced questions about his ties to the financier Jeffrey Epstein,
who took his life earlier this year
while awaiting trial on sex…
-Where does this bloody dust come from? -I know, sir.
[Amanda] "For the prince, the whole nerve-shredding exercise is designed
[Amanda] "For the prince, the whole nerve-shredding exercise is designed to show that he has nothing to hide."
to show that he has nothing to hide."
"It will show that he has been wholly honest and truthful."
"'In a way,' says a friend, 'he is saying, "Judge me.""
It's… It's excellent, isn't it?
It's… It's exactly the right tone.
-[sighs] -Very good.
Would you… Would you like me to be here tonight
when it… goes out?
Oh, no, I don't think so.
No, I really don't think that's necessary.
-[door opens] -[Sam's mum] Hello!
Nana, this is Freya.
-Hello. Come in. Come in. -Freya, this is Netta.
Hello.
Um, in… In fact, I'm convinced
that I was never in Tramps with her.
There's a number of things wrong with that story. One of which is that…
I don't know where the bar is.
I have a, um… a peculiar condition, which is that I don't sweat,
or rather I didn't sweat at the time. And that would…
and that is because I had suffered
what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War.
Because going to Pizza Express in Woking
is an unusual thing for me to do.
A very unusual thing for me to do.
[Emily] So, if Virginia Roberts is watching this interview,
what's your message to her?
I don't have a message for her
because I have to have…
She gives him every chance.
And if somebody's going to make these sorts of allegations…
[Andrew] We try and uphold the highest standards and practices,
and, um, I let the side down, simple as that.
Christ's sake.
[Andrew] No, I don't think so.
You probably dragged out of me most of what's required.
[Lucas] We're gonna sit up front, Mum.
Your Royal Highness.
-[cameras clicking] -[man 1] Amanda! [man 2] Amanda, a quick statement.
Would you like to comment?
The Palace have just released a statement from the Duke of York.
"I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back
from public duties for the foreseeable future,
and she has given me her permission."
"I continue to unequivocally regret
my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein."
"His suicide has left many unanswered questions,
particularly for his victims."
"I can only hope that in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives."
This is what Newsnight is.
We put the time in… to get the stories other shows won't.
Stories that need to be told,
that people care about,
hold the powerful to account
and give victims a voice.
Thank you.
Two lamb shawarma.
The usual.
Thanks. [chuckles]
You seen this? Love to be there when they filmed that!
PRESENT
INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS
Sigit, I'm out of paint!
Hurry! Commander Tjip bought us time!
Adji, check on Har!
Damn it. Why didn't you say something?
Just got off!
Hurry, Put!
They're shaking hands!
-No time! -There is.
ADJI, 23 AIR CADET I
Watch out!
30 more steps!
Get in line now!
Straight line!
In position.
This is it, the Pangeran Diponegoro bomber plane.
Shall we, Mr. President?
Turn right, move!
-When will it be completed? -Tjipto!
Permission, Sir. It will be ready as soon as possible.
Good.
Permission, Mr. President!
The paint is still wet.
Please take note.
Honesty above all else.
Someday one of you will fly this mighty plane.
These gentlemen are your role models.
Commander Soerja, Commander Tjipto with their amazing maneuvers.
Therefore...
don't ever doubt yourself.
Don't ever question yourself.
Spread your wings and fly!
Yes, Sir!
One year after independence, the Republic of Indonesia
negotiated with the Netherlands to obtain recognition of sovereignty.
The negotiation went on bitterly for months.
In the end, the Netherlands agreed to withdraw their troops.
Four months later, the Netherlands violated the agreement and carried out
a large-scale military offensive, starting on all air bases on July, 1947.
Someday I'll be flying one of those.
Aren't you afraid?
What if you crash?
Imagine seeing the world from up there.
One with the clouds.
I'll bring a handful...
...for you.
Congor Merah were equipped with SMG and explosives.
Nimble in the air and deadly on the ground.
But...
the one that destroyed the other airbases was this,
Buto Ijo.
Big...
and green.
It can carry up to one ton of explosives.
If this plane attacks us and we're down below,
it means…
see you on the other side.
Fortunately, all of us in Bugis moved fast to secure the area.
So there were not many casualties.
-What about Maguwo? -Yes, Sir.
No significant changes.
A cadet training with Tjureng became Congor Merah's target.
The plane was destroyed.
The pilot survived despite a delayed parachute deployment.
All our jets are hidden in the jungle.
Right now, they're moving slowly towards Jogja.
They know the government is based here.
I knew there was no use negotiating with the enemy.
What about Pangeran Diponegoro?
Yes, Sir. It's secured, unlike the other planes, Sir.
Is it ready for war?
Not yet, Sir.
We haven't found the fuel pump replacement.
For now we wait for orders from the commander-in-chief.
So for the time being...
we defend.
I can't wait to hit the Dutches back!
-Tjipto. -Yes, Sir.
While we wait, prepare all the planes and crews.
Find a way to get Diponegoro airborne.
Yes, Sir.
MAGUWO
-Where are the planes? -Hidden in the jungle.
And where are the cadets?
Go past the end of the runway. They're building decoy planes.
All right.
Steady.
Assemble!
We are at war.
We defend our independence by defending Maguwo.
All pilots must undergo simulation training everyday, all day.
Cadets...
continue building the decoy planes.
-Yes, Sir. -Yes, Sir.
Carry on!
Sigit.
-How are you doing? -Ready to take orders, Sir.
-Go help the others. -Yes, Sir.
Mul, are we really at war?
Yes, Git.
The Dutch have started moving from Tegal.
Which way?
By way of both north and west.
Striding along the south coast.
Guerilla News.
Guerilla movement in the south coast is getting more active
as citizens are being evacuated
including the villages of Wonokromo, Tirang and Kesirat.
-Mul, it's Kesirat. -Isn't it Asih's village?
I must go there. I'll ask Commander Tjip for permission.
-Thank you. -Hold on, Git.
We have work to do. Two decoy planes must be ready by today.
Probably all of them have been evacuated to a safer place.
Let's go.
Damn it.
What would our parents think.
They must have thought we were flying planes.
Look at what we're doing.
We need to be given a better role in this war, Har.
In your dreams. The war would've ended by then.
That's what you think.
I'll find a way.
Right, ten degrees. Pull right and observe the wind direction.
Don't be rash!
Git!
Two planes.
Four explosives.
They've wasted their ammunition.
You have done a good job.
Now we move the decoys a little to the west.
Cadets!
Continue making decoy planes.
Permission, Sir.
Maybe this task should be given to the engineers.
Because we…
...are ready for bigger responsibilities.
I'm entrusting this task to you.
This is a big responsibility.
Carry on!
Yes, Sir.
Damn it.
The war won't end this way.
I'm going to practice flying.
With what, Ji?
They're training with a flight simulator in the hangar.
That means nobody is using the planes in the jungle.
Let's go, Mul.
No. Our order is to build these.
Mul, I must watch Adji so he doesn't do something stupid.
If anyone asks, we're looking for bamboo.
Faster!
They won't give us even the slightest chance.
So always be on alert. On alert. Three.
Damn it.
Next.
What are you doing here?
Nothing. We're looking for more vines for the decoy planes.
Don't lie.
KARDI AIR FORCE SERGEANT
If you return now and carry on with your duty,
Commander Tjip won't know.
-Yes, Sir. -We're sorry. Thank you.
Freedom.
-Freedom. -Freedom.
Satisfied?
There's one more plane.
No one would be using it for training.
You're outvoted.
-Here is some rice to break fast. -Thank you, Ma'am.
Follow me.
-What will we get? -Not now.
It was just a chicken.
How are you, my love?
Please be patient.
Soon, we will fly together.
And we will kick the Dutch out.
Wake up, Ji. Stop daydreaming.
Why don't we use this in the attacks?
We can't. Fuel pump's busted.
-Can't we take it from another plane? -We can't.
All our planes are looted from the Japanese.
This plane is one of a kind. We can't use Guntei's or Hayabusa's pump.
ASIAN FORTRESS
Wait.
Remember I told you I once found a crashed plane?
-Back when you met Asih? -Exactly.
I'd watched the planes from the edge of a cliff.
One was covered in smoke.
Then it crashed into the valley.
For three months, I searched for it but to no avail.
Beautiful.
Absolutely beautiful.
What I'm asking is did you see writing like this?
Yes, Ji. I did.
I can read your mind, Ji.
That plane is damaged. It crashed. It's destroyed and burnt.
Like you've seen it.
Is that true?
The fuel pump inside the engine might have survived.
Give me a break.
It's just an excuse to visit your girlfriend's village, right?
No.
If we can bring it back to life, we would be heroes.
-One step closer to becoming a pilot. -Becoming a lunatic, for sure.
I'll talk to Commander Tjip.
Slow down.
What is it?
Permission, Sir.
Sigit has an important information.
Permission, Sir.
I think I saw the remains of Pangeran Diponegoro I.
-Where is it? -Permission, Sir.
It's right here, Sir.
Permission, Sir.
We can recover its fuel pump.
Then we install it on Pangeran Diponegoro II, Sir.
This area is past the demarcation line. It's too risky.
Permission, Sir. We must move as soon as possible.
If an expedition leader is required,
I'm ready, Sir, while the pilots are training.
Hang on.
-Sit down. -Yes, Sir.
I was once like you guys.
No one can subdue the fire than burns in me.
Commander Karbol and I flew Diponegoro from Bugis to Maguwo.
Commander Soerja was furious.
We were punished.
We were ordered to return to Bugis.
Just the two of us.
It wouldn't budge, not even a centimeter.
Permission, Sir. Why was it moved?
Diponegoro's presence would boost everyone's morale.
I wanted to be the cause of that.
Not long after, Diponegoro's engine broke and stopped working.
No one blamed me, but it kept me thinking.
If only I didn't move it, things might be different.
Don't make the same mistake.
You must think this through.
Really through.
Permission, Sir.
But this is for the people, Sir.
For the nation.
Is that really true, Ji?
Let me handle this matter.
Oh, yeah.
Mul said you went looking for bamboo.
Where are they?
Permission, Sir.
I have a complaint about them.
Why did they put this bamboo inside the barracks?
I'm sorry, Mul.
Permission, Sir.
Mul!
Thank you.
Don't drag me into this.
Next time, please follow the order.
You bet.
Git.
Don't you want to know if your girlfriend has been evacuated?
Of course I do.
If so, why don't we go there?
Might as well look for the fallen plane.
You have a death wish? You heard what Commander Tjip said?
No one asked you to come.
Relax.
We leave in a small group.
Get in and out quickly. The Dutch will never know.
What we need is engineers to help us dismantle the engine.
There's one who's good at combat.
We need your help.
TARDJO FLIGHT ENGINEER
-On who's order? -Commander Tjip's.
He trusts your capability.
-Did he really say that? -He did.
Didn't he, Git?
-But this is a top secret mission. -Top secret?
No one else should know about this,
be it the pilots, guards or chief of engineer.
Because we don't know who's on the Dutch side.
-Even in Maguwo? -Even in Maguwo.
I'm with you 100%.
Anything else I can do to help?
We need one more engineer to help dismantling.
I'm ready to assist.
Dul, the new engineer who can dismantle engines but can't assemble them, yet.
-Perfect! -Perfect?
Yes. And we also need weapons for protection.
Weapons...
Slowly.
-Freedom. -Freedom.
Aren't you the cadet who was shot down by Congor Merah?
That's correct. He's being punished.
You almost died and you're being punished?
Because he survived but the plane didn't.
A plane is not cheap.
It's difficult to be a pilot.
Better off as a engineer or a guard in a warehouse, right?
Not really.
Come on!
Excuse me. Can you help me move this?
My buddy here…
he has trembling hands because of Congor Merah.
We don't want to explode like fireworks.
Shall we?
Are you crazy?
-I'm still a virgin. -Me too.
-Let's go find ourselves a wife together. -You're nuts.
Thank you.
I hope you find a wife soon.
You guys are crazy.
Don't worry, Mul. We'll be back before sunset.
Come on, help us.
Find a way so no one knows, okay?
That's more like it.
It's clear.
-Do not give him any weapons. -Why?
I'm so sorry.
-Let's go. -Tardjo?
Come on!
It's for the Dutch.
That handkerchief. What's the story?
She gave it to me when I entered Maguwo.
I'll return it to her when I'm done.
That's what women do.
For reasons we'd never know.
What is your future wife like?
She'd always help anyone who's in trouble.
It's tough for me, especially in these conditions.
My advice is if you have attachments, don't go to war.
Don't join the military.
You'll gain nothing but pain.
A soldier without attachments can fight to the fullest.
Aren't these attachments fueling our courage to fight?
Where did your courage go?
Tardjo.
What's on your mind?
Family?
Lover?
No time to say goodbye?
I'm sorry, Sigit.
This war knows no end.
The Dutch, Japanese, and Dutch again.
There will always be war as long as people remain greedy.
So the options are go to war wholeheartedly
or go home and love wholeheartedly.
-Mul? -Yes, Sir.
Commander Tjip wants us to assemble.
Yes, Sir.
All right.
Straight line!
In position.
Count off from two! Count off!
Two, three, four, five
six, seven, eight, nine, ten!
At ease!
-Kardi. -Yes, Sir.
Sort the pilots based on this list.
Yes, Sir.
Listen up!
Cadets are to fix explosives on the Guntei
and reload the ammos on Hayabusa.
Get the engineer's help.
Understand?
Yes, Sir!
Permission to ask, Sir.
Can I fly too?
Be patient. All in the right time.
Yes, Sir.
Listen up.
All in the right time.
Attention!
Dismissed!
Maybe all of them have evacuated.
What is it, Ji?
Nothing.
We have to move.
-Git. -Sigit!
Sigit!
Asih's not here.
Is it still far ahead?
Come.
Go that way.
What is it, Sir?
Help!
Help! It's the Dutch!
Stop! You, search!
Commander. Commander.
Search over there and here!
On the right. Search the right.
Come on.
One step closer to being a pilot.
Hide!
He's clever for an old man.
Stop!
Everyone rest. I'm going to take a leak.
Six.
Tardjo.
Where is it? It's going to explode!
What now?
Let's move! Their comrades will be looking for them.
This is what we're looking for.
-Is it still working? -It should be.
What now?
-Har, can I return it now? -Not now.
This doesn't feel right. And I'm not cut out for this.
But you look like a real fighter pilot, Kaput.
Impossible for me. I don't have it in my blood.
My grandfather sold sugarcane.
My father sold cendol.
When I'm done, my choices are sugarcane or cendol.
-Come with me. -Wait.
Get up there. Hurry!
Hurry, Put.
Har!
Get inside, Put. Get in.
How does it feel?
So have your grandfather and father entered a cockpit before?
This makes you different. Your future is different, too!
It has nothing to do with your lineage.
-Where's Har? -Yes, Sir!
Listen closely.
Don't ever dream of flying with us.
-Understand? Got it? -Yes, Sir. Got it, Sir.
Is this also the direction to Maguwo?
-What's wrong, Sir? -It's nothing.
My son is there.
Really? My fiancé is there too.
Perhaps they're friends?
Perhaps.
Maybe they're good friends.
After everything calms down, let's go there together.
But now we must get to the shelter.
It's done, Sir.
-Thank you, Miss. -You're welcome.
WATCH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. ENEMY SPIES ARE AROUND US.
Bastards.
Where are you going, Republic rats?
Nobody raises their hands.
Freedom!
Freedom!
Who is that guy?
He's our golden asset.
He's their leader.
Hands up!
-I see you're carrying out your order. -Yes, Sir.
We've recovered some spare parts for the Pangeran Diponegoro plane
in a river near Kesirat village.
Escort them back to Maguwo.
Yes, Sir.
-You. Carry on. -Yes, Sir!
You're lucky that he's inspecting the troops at the frontline.
Permission, Sir.
Are there still some refugees on their way?
Leave it to us.
Is that all you think about, Git?
You should be praying for the plane to fly again.
Why were your men near the borders, Tjip?
The commander-in-chief used his escort vehicles
to take them back to Maguwo.
My apologies.
Without my consent, it seems they were trying to recover a spare part
-from the Diponegoro I-- -I don't care!
I don't care if they stole food from the neighbors!
This should not happen again.
Yes, Sir. I'll accept your punishment.
Punishing officers at this time would make me a fool.
Make sure they're disciplined.
Yes, Sir.
One more thing.
The reason I called you here...
The Dutch took over Semarang and Salatiga.
The citizens have been evacuated to Jogja.
Medical supplies are running low.
We have orders to fly to Singapore to get medical aid.
I need men I can trust to go.
-It'll be Karbol... -Yes, Sir.
-...Tjipto... -Yes, Sir.
...and Marmo.
Permission, Sir. What about Maguwo?
Ready to back you up, Tjip.
Permission, Sir.
It's the Black Mascot who went on many flying missions
and would bring his troops home safely.
Halim.
You've crossed our waters and conquered European skies.
The news likes to exaggerate.
Everybody knows that the news is actually being modest.
Tjipto.
Can we trust Halim to take helm at Maguwo?
Yes, Sir. I would trust him with my life.
Good. Then, take care of the transfer immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Help.
Are there more refugees?
I think we're the last ones, Sir.
We tried our best to avoid the Dutch.
-We went through the jungle. -Let's move.
Sir, are we passing through Maguwo?
All refugees are centered in the city.
Wait a minute.
Sir.
Shall we?
I need to get to Maguwo, Miss.
I was once captured by the Dutch.
They told me...
they contacted my son.
He had to be their spy or they would kill me.
Maguwo is in danger, Miss.
Hurry!
Adji.
Lights are on.
Why did you stop?
Up!
Legs up!
Permission to join.
Fall back!
Permission not granted.
Fall back.
Yes, Sir.
As I've said before...
whoever hangs on the longest will decide the punishment for this misconduct.
Ready!
Seven minutes, ten seconds.
Har, listen.
Har.
Don't punish Adji.
Whatever you do, don't punish Adji.
Or we will all be in trouble.
Up! Everybody up!
-Name it. -Permission, Sir.
Discharge him from Maguwo.
-Reason? -Bad influence on the others...
who really wish to learn, Sir.
Not a single person is leaving Maguwo.
Everybody stays.
All cadets will receive the same punishment.
No flying until you graduate.
Permission, Sir.
Does that mean...
we will not become pilots?
That's correct.
Isn't that too much?
What do you think?
I'm just worried. What if they're not as strong as us?
What if they leave?
Then leave.
Only the best will last.
I entrust Maguwo to you.
Conquer the sky.
Conquer the heart.
Why are you still here?
I want to see you guys lamenting your fate.
Go away.
It doesn't have to be like this, Ji!
So all of you blame me for this?
Pangeran Diponegoro came back to life because of me!
Weren't you all happy about it?
Getting shot at by the Dutch. I almost died! Almost died! For you!
I just realized…
that you're a bunch of hypocrites!
-Where are you going? -To find Asih
Attention!
Finally, the order we've been awaiting.
We'll attack the Dutch at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.
You're ordered to move all planes from the jungle to the runway.
Now, move.
Push!
In position!
Stop!
-Tardjo, get it ready. -Yes, Sir.
Everybody move!
Commander Kardi!
-Permission. -Yes.
-Where's Commander Halim? -Headquarters, discussing strategies.
He told me to get the planes ready.
He'll be here before the attack.
-Shouldn't we move Pangeran Diponegoro? -No need. Leave it there.
-Why? -That's an order, Mul!
Yes, Sir.
Kardi!
Permission, Sir.
Mul.
Something's up with Kardi.
We'll move slowly. Check on Pangeran Diponegoro.
Ji!
No one's guarding it.
It's safe, Mul.
Let's inspect.
What's that?
Help me.
Hurry! Get ready at the hangar!
What do you think? Don't I look cool?
Don't worry, Har.
We will win this war.
-Tell all your friends. -Yes, Sir.
It's happening.
Maguwo.
Protect Pangeran Diponegoro!
Why are you doing this?
We've lost, Har.
You better get out of here.
And Pangeran Diponegoro?
I have marked it.
It's no use, Har!
Make way!
Get out!
Get out!
Everybody out!
Mul!
Ji.
Har.
-Git. -No!
Dont!
Don't! Har!
It's all right.
Bear with it, Sigit!
Come on, Har.
-Where's Mul? -He's still inside.
Mul!
Mul!
-Wim. -Mul!
Mul!
Mul!
Mul?
Mul!
Mul.
Asih.
Kardi issued an order using my name to move all the planes to the runway.
He marked the barn where Pangeran Diponegoro was hidden.
Then he gave the Dutch a signal to attack, Sir.
And the planes?
All of them are damaged...
except the training planes as they weren't targeted.
-Any casualties? -15 dead.
The rest are terribly wounded and haven't been evacuated.
Order to evacuate from Maguwo.
Yes, Sir.
Asih?
Sigit.
Did you fly?
What was it like?
Exciting. Fun.
Weren't you afraid?
So where is it?
The cloud you promised me?
The truck will be here any minute.
We can evacuate together.
What is it?
Nothing.
From now on...
we'll always be together.
Forgive me, my son.
Forgive me…
If only I made it in time…
Har! Listen!
Enough, Ji. What else can we do?
We can still avenge them.
For Kardi
and the rest.
We have no more pilots.
Like it or not, they will pick us.
Git?
You're really something.
Sigit?
Sir.
Sir.
Tell me.
Did my son betray this country?
Sir.
I'll tell you the truth.
Kardi…
He informed the Dutch that...
...that Maguwo can never be conquered.
That the Republic will never surrender.
-That's what happened? -That's correct.
Kardi fought until his last dying breath.
He was protecting his friends.
Everyone who's here...
is still alive...
still living...
still breathing.
Everyone here survived because of Kardi.
And we will carry on what Kardi fought for.
We'll defend Maguwo and our country until our last dying breath.
After I bury my son...
can I fight alongside you?
Thank you.
Those who can't fight, don't push yourself.
Those who can, assemble at the hangar.
Freedom!
-Freedom! -Freedom!
I must join them.
-What are you doing? -We'll always be together, right?
But this is dangerous.
Everywhere is dangerous.
Besides, I can help.
Come on.
Mul.
Let's disassemble the other planes.
There should be parts we can use for Hayabusa and Guntei.
-That means we only have two planes left. -Four.
We have four planes.
Those are training planes.
We can't equip them with ammo.
Can we change that, Put?
I'll do my best.
Besides me and Adji...
we need two more men to fly the planes.
Right behind you! We'll make mincemeat out of the Dutch!
Pilots first.
Wait.
Are you serious?
Using broken planes to attack?
What are we targeting?
The Dutch bases.
That's suicide, Mul! They have Congor Merah.
If they retaliate, we're dead in seconds.
Sigit was lucky to survive.
-We don't know what else they have. -It's fine, Wim.
Willing participants only.
I'm ready.
I'll help Sigit.
One more.
Are you sure, Har?
Kaput, you're with me.
Get ready.
My fellow engineers, please do your best to weaponize the planes.
Yes, Sir!
I can't think of a reason, but I think I must go over there.
You lied.
What actually happened?
What is Congor Merah?
The enemy plane.
I was shot down during training.
I'm sorry. I didn't…
I'm sorry.
I didn't want you to worry.
So you're leaving again?
I promise I'll be back.
I've heard that before.
I would believe you more if you promised otherwise.
Don't say that.
I can't do this.
I'm sorry.
If you leave...
then I'm leaving.
I can't handle this.
I'm sorry.
Asih.
Impossible. They won't let us, Mul.
No permission, no flying, period.
Git. Let's go to the headquarters.
We plan to attack the Dutch.
Permission to receive orders, Sir.
Do you realize what you just asked?
In the worst case scenario, this will become a suicide mission.
We're ready to do it, Sir.
They're still serving their punishment, Sir.
They're not allowed to fly.
Permission to suspend the punishment temporarily, Sir.
-What's your name? -It's Mulyono, Sir.
You shouted in front of the President, right?
Yes, Sir. That's right.
One Guntei. One Hayabusa.
Two Tjurengs.
-What do you think, Lim? -Sir.
One air strike will make the Dutch
think carefully before making another move.
And this will help boost
our troops' morale on the ground, Sir.
You've put me in a difficult position.
If I gave you the permission...
it would mean sending you on a dangerous mission.
Whereas, you're here to learn.
You still have a future ahead of you.
If I didn't grant you permission...
I'd be betraying my conscience.
Let us fly, Sir.
All right.
When I call you, step forward.
-Mulyono! -Yes, Sir.
-Sigit. -Yes, Sir.
-Harbani. -Yes, Sir.
-Sapto Adji. -Yes, Sir.
I'm not giving you orders.
But I'm not stopping you either.
Halim will assist you with a strategy.
YOGYAKARTA MAGUWO
Our main target is Semarang.
Guntei and Hayabusa will go through the east route at full speed.
Use the dog lag tactic,
Go over Ungaran Mountain,
and then pull to north of Semarang, where the Dutch base is.
Drop the bomb twice.
Your main target is the hangar, then the artillery and the logistic.
Leave nothing behind.
Hayabusa will fire at the center of the Dutch base
as a distraction so Guntei can go in.
Tjureng I, Tjureng II...
you move through the west route, then turn to the east after the Merbabu.
Remember! Not to the east of Merapi.
Your main target is the armory.
You'll take off at dawn when it's still dark.
This is our chance to succeed.
And the Dutch will never expect this strike.
We didn't expect this either.
There's always a chance to retreat.
We'll keep moving forward.
After the attack...
all of you head back to Maguwo immediately.
Use the tree top tactic.
Fly low just above the trees, so Congor Merah can't spot you.
Remember!
When the sun rises and you're still not back,
we'll assume that you've failed.
Then we'll evacuate Maguwo immediately in anticipation of a counter attack.
Now get ready.
Yes, Sir!
Thank you, Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
O, to our country
We promise
O, to our country
We serve
Loyal.
-We are loyal. -Loyal?
O, to our country
We serve
O, for our country
Are our bodies and souls.
O, to our country
Git.
We promise

Are our bodies and souls.
-Freedom. -Freedom.
Freedom.
Attention!
Salute!
Attention!
Cadets.
I'll be waiting for you here.
Yes, Sir!
Salute!
Attention!
Permission. There's a problem.
Oil leak, Commander Halim.
We could fly it, but it'd explode in the sky.
I understand, Basir.
-Mul, you're flying without escort. -Yes, Sir.
What are you waiting for? Move! Hurry!
Ji...
fly my plane.
Kaput.
HARBANI, BORN ON LAND PERISH IN THE SKY -PILOT.
Hey! Fool!
This is your time.
I brought food for the boys.
Sir.
We'll wait for their return.
Kick them out.
Then come home to me.
Wim.
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
What about the others?
We lost them.
We were too slow.
15 minutes at 250.
Kaput! Sigit disappeared.
A while ago!
Why didn't you tell me?
What's down there?
A bomb. It's heavy.
Down there! Below!
Too dark.
Did you catch it, Put?
I did. A little bit.
Dutch!
Kaput, we must go up.
But they'll spot us.
There's no other way.
Semarang.
Logistic warehouse.
Bullseye!
Congor Merah.
We'll finish this mission before we die, Kaput.
Agreed. My thighs are already numb.
Throw it!
Let's take him down!
Freedom!
It's them.
Freedom!
-Freedom! -Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Mr. President, Dutch bases in Semarang, Salatiga and Ambarawa
were hit by air strikes from our forces in Maguwo.
My brother, send this news to all of our forces.
Yes, Sir.
Har!
Congratulations, all of you.
But your task is not done.
Hide all the planes in the jungle!
-Carry it out. -Yes, Sir!
Come on!
Ready for the next order, Commander Halim.
Our next mission is to defend Maguwo with our bodies and souls.
We'll show the world Republic of Indonesia's air sovereignty.
Yes, Sir.
Congratulations.
I'm proud of you.
Freedom!
Freedom!
The air strike on July 29, 1947 was the first air operation in history
that cemented the Republic of Indonesia's existence
across the international world.

-A for effort for sure. -Mm.
Nice try.
I don't understand why you won't go out with him.
We grew up together. It'd be like dating my brother.
Really cute brother. Oh. Well, why don't you go out with him?

The only thing they had in common was you broke up with them.
You know what? No. They have something else in common.

How can we help you, Mr. Kringle?
Kringles. It's a common mistake and call me Kris.
Are you the manager of this fine establishment?
Well, in theory, yeah. But she does most of the heavy lifting.
Only when you get that pesky twinge in your back.
Oh, I hate it when that happens. So Mr. and Ms. Phillips, you have installed a Santa station.
So Mr. and Ms. Phillips, you have installed a Santa station.
And Santa is here.
Well, that was fast.
We called the agency in Bozeman less than an hour ago.
When would you like me to start?
Don't you want to discuss terms?
Oh, well, whatever you have in mind will be fine.
Though obviously I can only be here till December 23rd,
then I need to get back home, get ready for my main job.
Right. [laughs]
Let's go to the office and fill out the forms.
-Keep? -Keep.
-Okay. -Ukulele.
-Then we a have a telescope. -Ooh, telescope.
[both] Keep.
Yeah, I like that. Okay, what's next?
And then we have a, um...
What do you suppose it is?
This is... it's clear, very obvious.
This is a uh, first edition...
-...whatchamacallit. -[gasps]
I didn't know whatchamacallits came in first editions.
You don't know everything, do you?
Huh. Keep.
[both] Nah.
-[doorbells ring] -Hey. -Hey. -Hey.
-Hey. -Hey.
I have a possible job opportunity for you.
-Hmm. -Okay, spill it.
Well, you know, the Carter house out on Country Road?
Uh, yeah. My dream house. I mean, in the life where I'm ridiculously rich. [laughs]
Well, somebody bought it and he hired me to bring it up to snuff
and asked if I knew any good local interior decorators. [gasps] And as a matter of fact you do.
[gasps] And as a matter of fact you do. Yes, you do.
Okay, so what's he want done?
As far as I can tell he wants the whole place furnished.
[gasps] What?
By Christmas.
By Christmas?
That's challenging.
But we love a good challenge, right? Yeah, yeah.
So, what's the budget?
Money is not an object.
Less challenging.
Well, I'm going to be up by his house tomorrow morning.
Can you make it? -Absolutely we can. -Yes.
Yeah, thank you.
-Of course. -Thanks.
-[doorbells ring] -Ah, they're here.
Ah, Mr. Sheenan and Miss Sheenan.
Welcome to the Royal.
Thank you, but it's uh, Connor and Daisy.
Certainly. Your suite is ready and waiting.
Perfect.
Why is there a Santa village in here?
He's going to be holding court in the afternoon so girls and boys can meet him.
Santa's going to be here?
That's right. Until December 23rd.
And then he has to go and do his real job.
Exactly. Let me show you up.
Thank you.
Oh, this is beautiful.
Oh yeah, this is nice.
It's our best suite.
Listen, call downstairs if you need anything.
We will.
-Enjoy. -Good night.
Well, what do you think?
I love this town, Daddy.
We're going to have the best Christmas ever here.
Yes, we are.
Yes, we are.
Um, there's a lot to be done but uh, I think you can imagine around it.
Already on it.
All right. Well he's down the hall. I'll go get him.
Okay, thanks.
I'm not lying when I said this was my dream house. Growing up it was the place we all wanted to live.
Growing up it was the place we all wanted to live.
Yeah. Well, I see why.
I mean, this place has so much potential. Look at the beams.
This could be our Architectural Digest moment.
And here he is, guys. Andi Buchanan, Whitney Alder, meet Connor Sheenan.
Andi Buchanan, Whitney Alder, meet Connor Sheenan.
-Connor? -Whitney.
-Connor? -Whitney. You two know each other.
-What are you doing here? -What are you  doing here?
I live here.
No, no, no, this is my house. No, you don't.
I don't live in this house. I live in Marietta. Wow.
Since when?
Since whenever I wanted to. What do you mean "since when?"
You never told me that you moved here.
Well, the last time I checked, I mean, you never wanted to speak to me again.
Maybe it's not the best time to talk about business.
So, you're still designing.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm still designing. That's what I do. I'm a designer.
We can come back tomorrow.
Are you still conquering the universe? Uh, no. No, actually I'm not.
Uh, no. No, actually I'm not.
Although it was pretty much conquered
by the time that I sold my company and retired.
You... you retired? That's, that's very funny.
Well, it sounds like you two really know each other. Uh. Yeah, we do. We do.
Uh. Yeah, we do. We do. We were actually engaged to be married. Oh, come on. Let's not get crazy.
Oh, come on. Let's not get crazy.
I mean, we were-- we were engaged to be engaged.
And then someone, uh, broke it off.
You know what? Thank you for your time, Mr. Sheenan.
We will just, we'll see ourselves out. Okay, hold on.
You guys don't have to leave.
I'm just trying to avoid a hostile work environment.
Okay, hold on. Hold on now. We are all professionals here, right? Yep. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Yep. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay.
Okay. And when we worked together it went well, right? That's true. 100% correct.
That's true. 100% correct. Okay, so this past relationship... Water under the bridge.
Water under the bridge. Ancient history.
100%, yeah.
And to be honest, I-- I love working with Whitney.
She designed my first offices and frankly she's the best designer I've ever worked with, so.
she's the best designer I've ever worked with, so.
What?
You think I'm the best?
Yeah, I do, yeah.
Well, thank you.
Okay.
So, do you want to see our portfolio?
Definitely, yeah.
Okay. That was awkward.
For you? Think about what it was like for me.
Wait, are you really sure you can work with him?
I'm not working with him, you're working with him.
No, I'm just cheering you on from the sidelines. Wait. What happened to
Wait. What happened to "Oh, there's no tension when we work together, ancient history?"
Okay. Look, look, Andi. We want this job, right?
This is our Architectural Digest moment.
This is the house. Right?
-Right. -Yeah. You can do this. -Yeah. I can do this. -Yeah.
-Yeah. I can do this. -Yeah.
-Okay. I can do this. -Okay, good.
About that "engaged to be engaged" thing? -Ugh. -And now he's living here?
-Ugh. -And now he's living here? You have some explaining to do there, Whit.
You have some explaining to do there, Whit.
Don't call me Whit.
-Come on, Whit. Whitty. -No, no, no. Stop.
[Andi] Okay. Tell me everything.
So, when we were dating we took a road trip
and we stopped here in Marietta, and we both fell in love with it
and thought it would be a great place to live. And you were talking about marriage?
And you were talking about marriage? Correction. He was talking about marriage.
Correction. He was talking about marriage. Right. You weren't interested.
Right. You weren't interested.
Well...
I mean, you just have to understand I was young, right?
I was so focused on my career
and I wasn't ready to get married, no way.
And besides I mean Connor was already married to his work.
And you weren't? Yeah, but not in the same way.
I mean, he had his eyes set on becoming master of the universe.
That's what he called it.
I don't know, I-- I didn't want to be Mrs. Connor Sheenan.
Yeah. You wanted to make your own mark.
You know, I wanted to succeed in my own right.
Yeah. No I-- I get that.
But maybe that's all in the past now? I mean, he sold his business.
I mean, he sold his business.
No, he'll buy another one.
People like Connor don't change.
Mm. Bless you.
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, great.
So, you're a concierge and a babysitter?
Concierge, that's a big word.
It's from Eloise.
I'm a huge Eloise fan.
-Really? -Mm-hmm.
That's a book for girls.
Nope. Boys like it too.
And uh, I'm not the concierge here.
I'll have you know that I'm the owner-manager.
And babysitter.
Well, we're a full service hotel, Miss Sheenan.
Santa!
Hi, Santa.
Hello there. I'm Daisy, but you know that.
I'm Daisy, but you know that.
Good to see you, Daisy.
Are you staying here?
I am.
So am I!
How marvelous! We're hotel mates.
Can I ask you a question?
Of course. I've always wondered.
Since Christmas Eve is such a big night for you, you must get so tired.
you must get so tired.
It can be a bit wearying.
Why do you do this?
Seems to me you'd want to spend the time before Christmas resting up.
That's a very good question.
Well, the truth is, visiting with boys and girls,
Well, the truth is, visiting with boys and girls, and hearing what's on their mind, what they're dreaming about and wishing for
what they're dreaming about and wishing for it totally pumps me up for the big night.
it totally pumps me up for the big night.
Makes sense.
The Phillips said that Santa was going to be here.
Do you want to go say hello?
Oh, I wish I could, but remember I have to go get those samples. -Yep. -Yeah.
-Yep. -Yeah. But tell him I say hi. I'll see you back at the store.
-Okay. All right, bye. -Okay, bye.
Hello. Hi, Santa. Welcome to Marietta.
Hi, Santa. Welcome to Marietta.
How very kind of you. Have you met my friend, Daisy?
Have you met my friend, Daisy?
I have not. Hi, Daisy. My name's Whitney.
Daisy's a guest here at the hotel.
Just like me.
[Daisy] Only until Christmas.
Then I'm moving into my new house.
Ooh, your new house? That's exciting.
Well, technically not new.
It's an old ranch house.
Well, not a ranch house like in California where I used to live. More like a ranch mansion.
More like a ranch mansion. Daddy said a cattle baron used to own it.
Daddy said a cattle baron used to own it.
Would that happen to be the Carter house out on County Road?
That's the one. It's really big.
And your father bought that?
There he is.
Daddy, come meet Santa and my new friend, Whitney.
Hi. Hi, Connor.
Uh, so I see you two have met.
Yeah.
Sweetie, this is Whitney.
She and Andi will be decorating our new house.
You mean like find all the furniture and figure out the wallpaper and stuff like that?
and figure out the wallpaper and stuff like that?
Uh yes. Stuff exactly like that.
Then can we talk sometime? I have some ideas for my room.
Okay yeah, that would be very helpful.
Could I do that Daddy? Talk with Whitney?
Well, you might want to talk with my partner, Andi.
Because she's going to be handling most of the project so...
Of course.
You know, we should probably let Whitney go. She's probably got places to be.
Yeah, I have to get back to the store
but uh, it was very nice to meet you, Daisy.
Nice to meet you.
And you too, Santa.
Bye, Connor.
-Hey. -Hey.
So, you ready for a bombshell?
Uh, not particularly.
Connor's a dad.
Yeah. He has a little girl.
That's nice.
Who looks to be about seven or eight
so apparently right after we broke up
he just moved right on with his life.
Where's the mother?
Nowhere to be seen. Which means...
Nowhere to be seen. Which means... He's a single dad, huh. More power to him.
He's a single dad, huh. More power to him.
No. No.
It means that I was right not to marry him.
I'm not following you.
Yeah, because I mean he's divorced or separated.
You know, she couldn't compete with his career so I was right.
Oh, you don't look so good.
Yeah, I don't feel so good.
Oh, Andi, you're burning up.
Why were you acting so weird today?
What?
With Whitney.
I was not acting weird.
Yes, you were. And fidgety.
Fidgety. Okay uh well, Whitney and I are old friends
Okay uh well, Whitney and I are old friends and she uh, used to work with me.
and she uh, used to work with me.
Before you were born actually.
Did you guys have a big fight or something?
Because you weren't acting like old friends. You were acting weird.
Okay uh, well...
We weren't just old friends. We uh, we dated.
You mean like "boyfriend-girlfriend" dated?
Yeah.
So, that's why you were acting so funny. You still like her?
You still like her?
No.
You know, it-- that was years ago, okay?
I like her as a... a friend.
Or I like her as someone that I'll be working with again.
It's complicated.
Grown-ups always say that when it isn't complicated.
Hey. What's the diagnosis? I'll live but I'm going to have to lay low for a while.
I'll live but I'm going to have to lay low for a while.
Ugh. All right. Well, let's get you home to bed.
Hey. You know all that one-on-one time with Connor Sheenan?
-Mm-hmm. -Until I get better, it's going to have to be you.
-What? -[coughing]
Okay, Whitney. You can do this. You're a professional.
-Hey, Daisy. -I've got some stuff to show you!
You do? Okay, well, I have some stuff to show you too.
Cool.
I'll be in my room, come see me when you're done talking to Daddy.
Okay, I will.
Oh, that girl's energy. Uh, yeah, she's got a lot of it.
Uh, yeah, she's got a lot of it.
I thought I was meeting with Andi.
Oh, yeah, well, she's just feeling a bit under the weather
so, um, stuck with me.
I'm sorry, to hear that. No, that came out wrong.
I'm sorry to hear that she's sick, not that I'm stuck with...
I got it. [chuckles]
Okay. Let's go inside.
-So, I have ideas about each one of the rooms. -Yep.
And I can get some of the items in our store. Others we can source locally.
Others we can source locally. But basically I just need to know what you like
But basically I just need to know what you like and what you don't like, all right?
Pretty simple.
Perfect.
Uh, will we be waiting on your wife to join us?
Wife?
Daisy's mom.
Oh uh, Daisy's my cousin's daughter.
Technically she's my daughter now but biologically speaking...
Your cousin?
Car accident when Daisy was 18-months-old.
Wow, I'm uh, I'm sorry.
No, no, you, you didn't know. But Daisy was a baby, and my cousin made me promise
But Daisy was a baby, and my cousin made me promise that if something happened that I would take care of Daisy.
that if something happened that I would take care of Daisy.
And something did.
-That poor girl. -I know.
But thankfully she was so young when it happened she didn't realize what was happening
she didn't realize what was happening when her parents passed and now I'm pretty much the only thing she knows
and now I'm pretty much the only thing she knows as a dad or a parent.
So, no wife?
Just me and Daisy. Ah.
And I was all geared up to tease you about a failed marriage.
Oh, I'm so sorry to disappoint you.
So uh, when did you move here?
Um, shortly after I...
After you dumped me?
Put a doomed relationship out of its misery. You know, because one of us had to.
You know, because one of us had to. And by the way you're welcome.
Yeah, well the business wasn't going to grow itself.
That was just job one. Oh, my job was never more important to me
Oh, my job was never more important to me than yours was to you, Whit.
You've got to stop calling me that, come on. Do you remember the mayor's ball?
Do you remember the mayor's ball? -Oh, here we go. -My newcomer of the year award.
-Oh, here we go. -My newcomer of the year award.
You gotta be honest, my chair was pretty empty.
You know what, though? I had a client dinner. -I told you that. -You had a client dinner?
-I told you that. -You had a client dinner? -Yes! -Okay, yeah. I rest my case.
-Yes! -Okay, yeah. I rest my case.
You know what? Can we just focus?
-Come on, Whit. -Do not call me that!
Hey, guys.
Oh, uh, sorry to interrupt. I have the cost breakdown for the building supplies.
I have the cost breakdown for the building supplies.
I need to go sign those.
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'll go check on Daisy.
-Hi. -What do you think?
Oh, I like it.
It's river beige.
It's nice.
I'm imagining the whole room around this.
Maybe that's backwards.
No, I don't think so. Actually, I think it's really smart.
Could I show you some more of my ideas?
Absolutely.
I'd love to see 'em.
I think a four-poster bed would be really great in here.
Oh, yeah. I agree.
And you know what? I know where we can find that exact bed.
-Wow, awesome! -Yeah.
Wishes folder? Hmm, I'm intrigued.
What else is in there?
Oh, you know, daydreaming kind of stuff.
-Like what? -Like this.
Oh, you want a horse?
Nope. I want to be a jockey. That would be so cool. Mm-hmm. What else?
Mm-hmm. What else?
And this is Mount Everest.
I'm going to climb it someday.
I bet you will.
Well, after you can tear yourself away from your awesome boat.
Yeah. A boat could be... fun.
Which is why you have it in your wishes folder, right?
Actually, it's not the boat.
It's the mom.
Yeah. My mom, she's not here anymore.
Or my dad.
Well, my first dad.
I'm sorry.
But Connor's my daddy now,
and he could get married someday, right?
Yeah, absolutely.
That's not a crazy thing to wish for, is it?
No, I think it's a great thing to wish for.
As long as it's, you know, it's the right person.
Like someone who makes him act fidgety,
like he swallowed a butterfly?
Well, I think, there's a little bit more to love than just butterflies.
than just butterflies.
Yeah, probably.
But that could be a good start, right?
Yeah. I suppose so. Yeah.
So, maybe my wish will come true.
It just might.
Hey. How you feeling?
Not worse.
That's good, right?
Chicken soup and cough drops. Oh, dinner and dessert.
So, how'd it go?
Uh, good. Yeah. I mean, we went through each one of the rooms
I mean, we went through each one of the rooms and he likes some of our choices.
and he likes some of our choices. He had different ideas on others.
He had different ideas on others.
But um, all in all, it was okay.
We're going to take a road trip tomorrow and um...
we're just going to see what some of the other vendors in the county have to offer.
Uh, Whitney? That's not at all what I meant.
I meant, "How did it go?"
If you're talking about was there any blood drawn? No.
No, I was nice.
Well, did you find out about the wife?
No wife.
Daisy is the daughter of his late cousin.
She lost her mom? That's so sad.
She lost her mom? That's so sad. Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know.
But Connor adopted her, so.
Wow. Well, that's a lot to take on. -Good for him. -Yeah.
-Good for him. -Yeah.
-It's interesting, though. -What's interesting?
Well, he's single.
Well, he's not married.
And out of all the places he could've moved, he moved here.
I explained that.
A place you both fell in love with.
A lifetime ago.
And despite everything that's happened between you two he's still willing to work with you.
he's still willing to work with you.
Okay, where are you going with this?
Love moves in mysterious ways.
You gotta stop with the whole romance novel thing.
And they all have happy endings. Mm-hmm.
Eat your soup. It's getting cold.
Well, thank you guys again for doing this for us.
-I appreciate it. -You're welcome.
Oh, he's a first-rate babysitter, Daddy.
But I got extra backup.
I worked my way through college babysitting.
Why do they call it that anyways?
I mean, I'm a kid, not a baby.
-[laughs] -That's a good point.
Hey, listen.
If she gets in your hair, don't hesitate to put her to work.
Are you planning on getting in our hair, Daisy?
Not sure what that means, but I don't think so.
Well, we should be back by dinner.
Yeah.
Aww. -Have fun, Daddy. -Thank you, sweetheart.
You too, Whitney.
-Bye, Daisy. -Bye.
Thank you, guys.
Okay, bye.
-Drive safe. -Thank you.
-Hi, Eric. -Hi, Whitney.
Thanks for calling me back. Listen, I have a favor to ask.
Yeah.
[Whitney] Sven is sixth generation Montana.
This whole area was a mecca for Scandinavians.
Clearly undaunted by the uh, weather.
[laughs] Yeah.
So, he has a lot of connections through his family
So, he has a lot of connections through his family and through the community,
and through the community, so, he gets first dibs on all the estate sales.
But here's the deal. He's very old school.
So, no internet presence, no cell phone,
I mean, if you want to see his stuff, you gotta come to him.
Old school. I like it.
This coming from a man who's got to have the newest,
hottest gadget as soon as it hits the market?
Boys like their toys, you know.
Yeah, well I bet you got a lot of them. I did.
Now, I'm all about downsizing.
I'd hardly call your house a downsize.
Well, you didn't see my other one, did you?
So, how often do you guys plan on visiting Marietta?
Oh, no, we're uh, we're here to stay.
Until the boredom scares you away.
Are you bored?
No, but I run a business.
It sounds like you're planning on being a man of leisure.
I know, doesn't that sound good?
Let's see. Gosh, there's so many things in here.
-[horn honks] -Oh! Stop that!
Oh, oh. East wing hallway. What do you think?
Yeah. I think it's perfect. -Yeah? -Yep.
Sven, put it on the list, please.
Yeah, it's good.
Sven doesn't talk much, does he?
Well, that's Sven.
[gasps] Ooh, there it is.
I don't know.
I'm not much of a brass bed guy.
No. No, it's not for you. It's for Daisy.
She wants one like this. Add it to the list, Sven.
No way.
That is crazy.
That is crazy. What? DVD? Nobody watches DVDs anymore.
No, look what it is.
-Is that... -Yeah.
This is the exact production that we went to on our first date.
Oh, I love this.
Yeah. That was a good date.
Yeah. You know what, I'm surprised that you were able to get tickets to this.
It was sold out forever.
-You're surprised that I got tickets to that? -Yeah.
It's pretty much the whole point of being master of the universe, is getting tickets to sold out stuff like that. Well, maybe I should rephrase that.
Well, maybe I should rephrase that. I'm surprised you wanted to go.
Well, yeah. I would've gone anywhere if it meant I got to go on a date with you.
Hey, I would like to get this for Daisy for her stocking.
What do you think?
-Yeah. Good idea. -Yeah? Okay.
Sven, put it on the list.
-Hi there. -Hello.
You know Whitney, right?
Oh, everybody in Marietta knows Whitney.
She seems really nice.
She is.
Does she have like, a boyfriend?
Not that I know of.
Why, you planning on playing a matchmaker?
What's a matchmaker?
It's someone who puts two people together.
Together like "boyfriend-girlfriend?"
Exactly.
Is it hard to learn to be a matchmaker?
I don't know. I've never tried it.
A smart little girl like you? Shouldn't be that hard.
That sounds like a really good choice.
-Thank you. -Merry Christmas.
Well, that was fruitful.
Yeah. What you and Andi got and what we just bought, we are well on our way.
I would say so.
-Hey. -Yeah?
-Want to grab some lunch? -Yeah. Yeah, let's do that.
There is this cute little diner about 20 minutes down the road.
-Sold. -Okay.
-Eric. Hey. -Hey, Andi.
Uh, Whitney said you weren't feeling well.
Oh, yeah. I've been better.
Well, I got you some lunch. It's a tuna melt from the diner. You like those, right?
My favorite.
Some red cabbage slaw and curly fries.
That is my dream lunch. She knows me so well.
Oh, actually, she just said get Andi some lunch.
I figured out the rest. Oh. Uh, wow.
Thank you.
Oh, eat it while it's warm, though.
Right.
And get some rest and feel better.
-Thank you. -Of course. I'll talk to you later.
-Bye. -Bye.
So, uh, what do you do in Marietta when you're not working?
You mean for fun?
Yeah.
[laughs] I knew it. You're already bored.
I am not bored.
This is about you, not me.
Mm, okay. All right.
For fun?
-Well, I'm part of a book club. -Okay.
I also teach a Zumba class
three times a week at the rec center for retirees.
Perfect. I'm joining that.
-For old retirees. -Oh, okay.
And I have to tell you I love it.
Some of their stories are fascinating.
Any uh, cowboy poets?
You know, I guess, they all are in their own right. Yeah.
Actually, I've been thinking of
trying my hand at cowboy poetry myself.
-You have? -Mm-hmm.
Huh. Okay, so you know, how to ride a horse and lasso,
and buck a bronco? All that.
No. I actually don't know how to do any of that stuff.
But it's on my bucket list, so...
Mm. Also something that you may not know about me
is I am an avid line dancer.
-You? -Mm-hmm.
So, you're down there doing the old Texas Two Step, huh?
That's not really a line dance, but I do know how to do the Cupid Shuffle and the Cotton-Eyed Joe and...
the Cupid Shuffle and the Cotton-Eyed Joe and... -Oh. -All of 'em, yeah.
-Oh. -All of 'em, yeah.
Well, you dance with anyone in particular?
That is um, subtle.
Well? Are you?
Uh, well not that it's any of your business, but no, I'm not.
That's too bad.
Too bad for, not too bad for me.
No, it's too bad for the opposite sex. 'Cause believe it or not you were actually a pretty great girlfriend.
you were actually a pretty great girlfriend.
Are you being sarcastic? I can't tell. I know it's hard to comprehend,
I know it's hard to comprehend, but you were actually pretty good.
but you were actually pretty good.
Uh-huh. How so?
Okay. Well, you're easy to be around,
you're fun, you're funny, kind of smart.
You know what? I would have to agree with all of that actually.
Oh, you're clearly modest too.
-[laughs] -Really modest. That's one of the highlights for sure.
But you do-- let's not forget, you do have your faults.
Oh here-- here it goes.
You know, sometimes you're a little unreliable and uh,
just a tad bit self-absorbed.
-Self-absorbed? -Just a tad.
I'm not self-absorbed! Okay, okay, you're right. All in all
Okay, okay, you're right. All in all
you were a pretty good girlfriend.
I am going to let that last little bit slide.
But... enough about me, how about you?
Did you leave behind a sweetheart in California?
No.
I actually have not dated since I've become a dad.
Why not? There's a lot of single parents that go on dates.
No, you're right. It's just that, uh... I made a choice that if I had any spare time
I made a choice that if I had any spare time that I would spend it with Daisy,
and if she needed me I'd... I'd be there.
Actually, this is the closest thing to a date
that I've been on in years.
Oh, that's uh...
It's pathetic, I know.
No, I was actually just going to say that was really...
sweet.
Room for dessert? Chef made figgy pudding.
It's vanilla custard with whipped cream and chopped nuts.
That sounds really good but I think I'm going to have to pass.
Me too. We'll actually have the bill. We're going to hit the road.
Oh, well, you won't be doing that.
What? Why not?
You two lovebirds...
-Oh no, no, no. -We're just friends.
Just friends.
You have been so caught up talking you haven't noticed all the snow we've been getting.
Wow. That is a lot of snow.
Uh-huh. Even for Montana in December.
Highway's snowed under a mile down the road
and the engine on the plow went out.
So we're stranded.
Unless they can fix that plow. Probably for the night.
Okay. Well...
On second thought, how about that figgy pudding?
Yeah, better make it two.
Okay.
Well, I better call Daisy.
Yeah.
[Whitney] Thank goodness this B&B is still open.
Well, hey there. Welcome to the Dewdrop Inn. -What can I do ya for? -Oh!
[both] We're stranded. Oh right. That darn plow.
Oh right. That darn plow.
I've been telling the mayor for years now we need a new one.
Does she listen?
Do you have any available rooms or...?
As a matter of fact we do. On the account of the snow we've had some cancellations. Okay, good. Can we take two?
Okay, good. Can we take two?
Sure can.
Did you have any luggage with you? Uh, no. No, we don't.
Oh. Well, seeing as you arrived empty-handed
I'll see if I can rustle up some unopened toothbrushes for you. -Thank you. -Great.
-Thank you. -Great.
Here you go.
Now, it gets a little chilly at night. I'll see if I can drop by some sweaters for you
I'll see if I can drop by some sweaters for you -to keep you warm. -That's very kind of you.
-to keep you warm. -That's very kind of you.
-Thank you. -Yeah.
Oh, and once you get settled, check out the common room.
And we have complimentary hot cider.
Mmm. All right then, thank you so much. -Thank you. -You're most welcome.
Enjoy. Make yourselves at home. -Okay. -Thanks.
It's so cold. It sticks to my teeth.
That's why they call it the snow mask. Come on, let's go inside.
Come on, let's go inside.
[Daisy] It's magical. [Reed] That's a good word for it.
[Reed] That's a good word for it.
Your dad called.
He and Whitney are going to be stuck overnight because of the weather.
-Are they okay? -They're fine,
but you're stuck hanging with us for the evening.
You can help me thread popcorn and cranberries
for the Christmas tree. -Fun. -[laughs]
-Fun. -[laughs]
Hi, Santa.
Evening, Daisy. Mr. Phillip, Ms. Phillip.
We're stringing popcorn and cranberries, wanna help? Oh, that sounds like fun. Thanks, I'd love to.
Oh, that sounds like fun. Thanks, I'd love to.
Don't laugh.
Okay, turn that thing off.
[laughs] It's so bad. Yeah.
I think yours is worse, though.
Uh, I know.
It was very nice of them to loan us these,
but I don't know, I think they might be a little colorblind. Uh, let's be charitable and say that.
Uh, let's be charitable and say that.
Meet the Misses, folks.
Hi, I'm Lucy.
-Hi. -Hi, Lucy.
Oh! You're in luck. Found some new toothbrushes.
Yeah. And some flannel PJs.
Oh, thank you. [Lucy] I'm so glad they fit.
Yeah. You can keep 'em, if you like.
-No! Couldn't do that. -Oh, no, no.
No, no. They're leftovers from last Christmas's ugly sweater party.
Meant to throw 'em out.
Most ridiculous things we've ever seen.
-[Gus] But warm, I'll bet. -Uh, yeah.
Well, anyway, you have a good night.
-Goodnight. -Goodnight.
-Goodnight. -Goodnight.
We of little faith.
Oh, yeah.
So... Yeah.
Guess we'll just sit here and drink cider and talk about old times.
Hmm... Or, or we could play a game of chess.
Or, or we could play a game of chess.
There's also Jenga. Hmm.
Or...
Or we could...
Seriously?
Yeah, seriously.
You don't recall?
Oh, I remember, yeah.
So, you remember that every time we played I beat you?
Well, maybe I got better.
Did you?
There's only one way to find out.
How much money do you have?
How's that?
You're on.
Gin.
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
That is you being better?
I said there's only one way to find out. Pony up. Come on.
Thank you.
Does it ever get boring winning all the time?
You know, you would think so, but no, no, it doesn't. You do know that Gin Rummy is supposed to be a game of chance.
You do know that Gin Rummy is supposed to be a game of chance.
Now, that's true. That is true.
So, we can play again if you'd like.
No, no. I am tapped out.
Your credit's good with me, sir. Oh, yeah.
You are in the wrong profession.
You need to be down in Vegas being a card shark.
Well, then I wouldn't be here with you decorating your house.
No, you wouldn't.
I'm feeling very guilty right now for taking all your candy, so, uh, I'm going to turn it in for the night, I think.
so, uh, I'm going to turn it in for the night, I think.
It's late. Yeah.
Get some rest.
Yeah, you too.
You know, we just had a lot of fun today, right?
Yeah, we did.
We did. We did.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Oh, good morning.
Wow, look at this spread.
Thank you.
How did you sleep?
Oh, like a baby.
-Up hungry every two hours? -[both laugh]
No, I slept right through.
Oh, glad to hear, glad to hear.
Uh, help yourself to some breakfast.
I highly recommend the oatmeal.
Lucy's kind of famous for it.
So I hear. I'll have some of that. All right.
All right.
Oh, and the plow is back in commission so you can hit the road again.
so you can hit the road again. Okay, great.
Okay, great.
Thank you.
Uh, by the way have you seen Connor this morning?
Oh, yeah. He's been up for a while.
He's outside working on a special project.
-Special project? -Mm-hmm.
All right. Thank you. You're welcome.
Mmm. This is good. -Right? -Mm-hmm.
-Enjoy. -Bye.
Looks like somebody's been busy all morning.
You know I haven't built one of these since I was a kid. I used to love this.
Wow, that's a nice one. Yeah, but the problem is
Yeah, but the problem is I'm horrible at decorating these things.
Yeah, hmm.
I wish there was a designer around to help us.
I know. Where could we find a designer right now?
What are you up to? Where are you going?
I haven't seen our guests. Did they check out already?
Not yet.
[Lucy] Oh, my word.
Just take it.
You gotta be faster than that.
[Lucy] Oh, to be young and in love.
Ah, young and in love is all right, I suppose.
But not nearly as sweet as old and in love.
Who are you calling old?
I'm not calling anyone old.
I'm just making an observation.
-Good! -Perfecto.
-It looks good, right? -It looks good, yes. Boom.
[Connor] Hey, Daisy. So, we're on our way back right now.
We should be back in Marietta around mid-afternoon.
I want to hear everything about your trip.
And what if I don't remember everything about the trip? [Daisy] Then Whitney better.
[Daisy] Then Whitney better.
I got you covered, Daisy.
Thanks. I'm going to hang up now
because it's not safe to drive and talk on the phone.
Bye, Whitney, love you, Daddy. Love you too, sweetheart.
Love you too, sweetheart. Bye.
Aww. That girl.
She has this astounding capacity for enjoying life. I just love her energy.
I just love her energy. -It's pretty much boundless. -Mm-hmm.
-It's pretty much boundless. -Mm-hmm.
She makes you happy, doesn't she?
Yeah, she does.
That little girl turned my life completely upside down for the good.
And honestly, things that used to be important to me
And honestly, things that used to be important to me just aren't anymore.
just aren't anymore.
-Like the company? -Exactly like the company.
You know, that's crazy. I never thought I would hear you say that. Yeah, so you've made very clear.
Yeah, so you've made very clear. Sorry.
Sorry.
Well, you've changed too.
I've changed? How have I changed? You're not nearly as intense.
You're not nearly as intense.
Intense?
[laughs] Yeah.
-What do you mean "intense?" -Really?
You're just talking a mile a minute, pacing back and forth, you know, walkin'. "I'm walkin' here!"
pacing back and forth, you know, walkin'. "I'm walkin' here!" You know, just intense. I wasn't intense!
-[laughs] -Was I intense?
Yeah.
Oh, I was intense, wasn't I? Oh, I'm so sorry. Ugh. Ugh.
I guess I needed a chill pill to be honest with you.
I guess I needed a chill pill to be honest with you. And Marietta was that for me.
And Marietta was that for me.
Kind of like Daisy changed you.
Yeah.
Anyway, I'm sorry for all that intensity.
-Let's make a deal. -Hmm?
No more sorrys.
Deal. Yeah.
And to be honest, I don't think either of us
And to be honest, I don't think either of us have really changed.
I just think we grew up.

Sorry guys. It's an emergency. Santa, I need to tell you something.
Santa, I need to tell you something. Oh?
My Christmas wish.
That's right. You haven't shared that with me yet.
Can I tell you now?
Of course.
What a wonderful wish. I'll see what I can do.
Thanks Santa.
Yup. Lunch and dinner yesterday.
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner today. The diner must love him.
The diner must love him.
I don't know.
That lasagna tasted homemade.
And the man can cook.
Okay look, I know I was sick
but asking him to be my 24/7 meals on wheels? Little bit overkill.
Little bit overkill.
I only asked him to bring you lunch yesterday. The rest of it was all him.
The rest of it was all him.
-Really? -Mm-hmm.
So, on top of him being a master chef
he's thoughtful, and kind, and generous.
And...
And he didn't ask me out, not even once.
You seem disappointed about that.
[flustered] No, no.
Anyway, I am feeling much better
and I am looking forward to getting back to work.
How are things looking for the Christmas party on the 23rd?
Uh, well, there's still a lot to do but I think with you on board, you know, there's a good chance we could make it happen.
you know, there's a good chance we could make it happen.
Wait a second. "A good chance"?
That is not the confident Whitney Alder I know and love.
You know what?
You're right. We're definitely going to make it happen.
That's more like it.
If we're lucky.
Stop it!
Merry Christmas.
Santa, we need to talk to you.
We wanted you to know that the kids and their parents absolutely adore you, Kris.
absolutely adore you, Kris.
Of course, they do. He's Santa.
And we were wondering if, well, if we could ask a favor.
Of course. How may I be of service?
The night before you have to leave,
we're having a Christmas celebration right in front of the hotel.
There's going to be booths, games, and music.
And this awesome guy who juggles elf dolls. Oh, is that offensive?
Oh, is that offensive?
Heavens no. They'd be honored.
Well, we'd be honored if you were our special guest. It all ends with the lighting of this fabulous Christmas tree.
It all ends with the lighting of this fabulous Christmas tree. Hoping you would pull the switch.
Hoping you would pull the switch. Well, not a switch exactly.
This really fun snowman, and when you push the top of his... Oh, well you'll see.
Oh, well you'll see.
This sounds like a pretty important job.
I may need an assistant. Do you think you could help me out?
I most certainly could!
Excellent!
[laughs] Ho, ho, ho.
-[Eric] Almost there. -[Connor] Yeah, wow.
Yeah. We got a couple hardwood floor patch ups.
Okay.
Last coat of paint in your office. Yup.
Yup. And that plumbing fixed in the kitchen.
Perfect.
I've coordinated with Andi and Whitney, so we can stay out of each other's way. Okay.
Okay. We're going to have you ready for that party.
You did it. Thank you.
-My pleasure. -I appreciate it. It's going to be quite the party.
Yeah.
You know, I gotta say man. I am... I'm impressed.
With what?
Well, that you and Whitney can work so well together after, you know. Oh. Pfft.
Well, she's an awesome designer and plus, I like her.
As in you're into her again?
I was never not into her. She broke up with me, remember?
She just wasn't ready to get married. Hmm.
Well, the girl I'm interested in isn't even ready to go on a date.
isn't even ready to go on a date. Oh.
But I keep asking. Going on three years.
-Three? -Three. Oh. That is dedication.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-Yeah. -Yeah. Well, maybe I'm a fool, but I gotta say, she's the one.
Well, maybe I'm a fool, but I gotta say, she's the one.
Well, pretty romantic for a general contractor.
Well, we're not as macho as we look. -I guess not. -Yeah.
-I guess not. -Yeah.
You know, though, Eric, I...
When I was going after an asset or an acquisition, trying to court them, and they would resist my overtures,
trying to court them, and they would resist my overtures,
I would just stop calling. Stop emailing.
I would just total ghost.
And guess what?
More often than not, they would start courting me.
I mean, no offense, that sounds like kind of a high school move.
Oh, no, no, no, it's a total high school move. But... it works.
But... it works.

What do we have here?
LA's Man of the Year Award. Whew!
I'm guessing that's a bigger honor than Marietta's Man of the Year.
Yeah.
There's two of those?
Oh, uh. They were actually selling these in the lobby the night we went to the ballet.
It was our first date.
Oh, so it's like a collector's item?
No, I don't think so.
But your first date is.
Or we both just really like bobble-head dolls.
Oh, right, yes of course. Because you only have one and so does he.
Or maybe it's just, it was a really good ballet.
Okay. When are you going to stop making moon eyes at the guy and tell him you are crazy about him?
and tell him you are crazy about him?
What? I don't even know what moon eyes are.
Moon eyes. Moon eyes, like, you know like... Mmm...
I don't do that!
-Oh, yeah? -No.
Let me get you a mirror.
Guys, the finished product looks sensational. -Thank you. -We try.
-Thank you. -We try.
Uh, the bakery is having a sale on these yummy looking Christmas cupcakes.
Give them.
Ooh, we could use some yummy right now. Yeah.
Uh, Whitney. The one with the green frosting is for you. It's got chocolate chips on it,
The one with the green frosting is for you. It's got chocolate chips on it, and you really like those, don't ya?
Yeah, they're my favorite. Thank you.
Well, that's it. I have some paperwork to take care of.
-Enjoy. -Okay.
-Bye. -Bye.
See ya.
What?
Why didn't he get me a special cupcake? He knows what I like.
He knows what I like.
Well, maybe they were out of them.
We haven't even had our honeymoon and it's already over.
-Hey. -Hey.
Daddy, Whitney!
These guys are going to be in my class in January.
I invited them to our Christmas party. Aww, that's amazing. Merry Christmas.
Aww, that's amazing. Merry Christmas.
Excuse me. Daisy, it's time to get ready. Bye guys.
Bye guys.
-There she goes. -Bye.
All right, so have I officially thanked you for getting the house ready for the party?
for getting the house ready for the party?
Only about a million, trillion times.
Well, I'm going to have to thank you another million, trillion times. You know what? I'll take it though.
Okay.
Because do you know how many boxes I had to go through of your stuff?
I have an idea.
You have a lot of stuff.
I only sent half of it to be honest.
Oh, and by the way, I found your, um, Nutcracker bobble-head doll.
Nutcracker bobble-head doll.
-You found that? -Yeah, I did.
Oh, man. You must have thrown yours away years ago. I just, I couldn't do it.
I just, I couldn't do it.
Oh, why, did you use it as a paperweight?
No, it just...
because it reminds me of one of the best days I've ever had.
Yeah.
Well, I have to make a small confession.
What?
I have mine too.
For the very same reasons.
-What? -Come here.
Where are... where are we going? Don't worry about it.
Where are we going?
I... I don't know if I'm crazy but I just... Yeah, I mean, you're a little crazy.
Yeah, I mean, you're a little crazy.
No, I... What are you getting at?
Life's about second chances, right?
That's what they say.
And, I mean, before we weren't, we were great.
And, I mean, before we weren't, we were great. We were so good.
We were so good.
And we've both grown up.
-So... -So...
Maybe we should...
Are you going to get that?
-No. -[laughs]
-Come on. -You should get it.
No, I don't... I, I should not get it. Really?
It's okay. [clears throat]
Hello?
Hey, Freddy.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, you-- you are?
What time?
Okay. No, I'll make you lunch.
No, I'll make you lunch.
Yep, yeah. No. I'll send you the address.
No. I'll send you the address.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Uh, old friend from LA.
He's actually passing by on his way to a ski trip, so, um...
Welcome, everyone. Happy Holidays!
We're so glad you could join us on this special night. And this really has been a special Christmas season.
And this really has been a special Christmas season.
In no small part thanks to a wonderful man,
our honored guest, Kris Kringles.
Yeah, Santa!
Thank you all so much.
Truly I live the most blessed life.
Christmas is about sharing and caring,
and hoping and wishing.
That I have been tasked to play a small part in all that,
well, it makes me the luckiest man alive.
And this Christmas has been especially special for me too,
because I'm able to share it with all of you.
Now, I believe it's show time.
Miss Sheenan, shall we do the honors?
On the count of three.
One, two...
Three!
Isn't the tree awesome?
Yes. It's beautiful.
Well, thank you guys for the lift.
Oh, by the way, I have to stop by the house tomorrow. Uh, one last finishing touch. Poinsettia.
Uh, one last finishing touch. Poinsettia.
Okay, you've already done enough. You know that.
Well, consider it a housewarming gift.
Okay.
Hey you.
I had a really good time today.
Me too.
All right then. -Goodnight. -Goodnight.
-Goodnight. -Goodnight.
Dad?
You ready?
Yes.
Okay.
Oh. Someone went shopping.
So which one do you like? Well, red's my color, so...
Not for you, for me. For Connor's party.
Oh, okay. Well, the blue looks great with your eyes.
Um, the red brings out your rosy cheeks
and it's very holiday and glittery and it's pretty.
And then, oh, then you can't go wrong with a little black dress, so.
Right. So, no clear winner?
Not really. Why does it matter?
Because it matters.
Are you trying to impress somebody?
Wha...? No.
No, I just, you know. I just, I just want to look my best.
I just, I just want to look my best.
Okay.
Well, if you just want to look your best, then I would go with the blue.
then I would go with the blue.
It's his favorite color.
I'll show you where the stuff goes.
Freddy.
Hey.
You found us.
Hey, GPS works even in the middle of nowhere.
Well, I would hope so. Good to see you, man.
It's good to see you, too. It looks like our lunch is catered.
Oh, no, we're actually having a Christmas party here later. You're welcome to stay, obviously.
You're welcome to stay, obviously. Oh, I wish I could.
I have to get to the lodge before dark.
Yeah, I'm afraid this is going to be an eat and run, my friend.
Let's get you fed.
-Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas.
That was delicious. You really did this yourself?
You really did this yourself?
I can't take all the credit. I had a lot of help from Daisy.
You're going to laugh, we've been taking online cooking classes.
You could've just hired a cook. 100% I could've.
But I moved here to make life more simple and plus it's... it's something fun I get to do with Daisy.
and plus it's... it's something fun I get to do with Daisy.
-Yeah, I can appreciate that. -Yeah.
Full disclosure, this isn't entirely a social call. Oh, okay. Seen this coming.
Oh, okay. Seen this coming.
Look, Freddy, I love you
but whatever you're trying to pitch me, I'm just probably not interested. Just hear me out.
Just hear me out.
Okay, but I'll give you the elevator pitch.
The elevator. -No more than that. Let's go. -All right.
-No more than that. Let's go. -All right.
Hi.
[Freddy] Someone with your skillset and track record in professional connections should be doing more
in professional connections should be doing more than baking bread and throwing down home Christmas parties.
than baking bread and throwing down home Christmas parties.
So, it would really mean a lot to a lot of people, including me.
And we'd be thrilled to have you on board. [Connor] I'm definitely interested, so.
[Connor] I'm definitely interested, so.
[Freddy] Why don't you come to LA after the holidays and meet everybody? Kick the tires a little.
Kick the tires a little.
Yeah, I think I could make that happen. [Freddy] Oh, well I'll send the private jet.
[Connor] Send the private... Let's not get ahead of ourselves. [Freddy] All right, fair enough.
But hey, I really need to hit the road. [Connor] Fine, I'll let you go.
But let me walk you to your car at least. All right.
[Freddy] Oh, I'm full.
[Connor] Yeah, I know, me too.
By the way, whoever decorated this place did a fantastic job. Oh! Oh!
[Freddy] Hello.
Hi. There she is. The mastermind behind all this.
There she is. The mastermind behind all this. Whitney Alder.
Whitney Alder. -That's me. Hi. -Hello.
-That's me. Hi. -Hello.
Whit, meet one of my old friends and business colleagues, Freddy Andrews. Nice to meet you.
It's very impressive, Whitney.
You ever work in LA?
Not anymore, no.
That's too bad.
Well look, Merry Christmas to you both and we'll talk soon, Connor. -Yes, we will. -All right.
-Yes, we will. -All right.
Drive safe.
Hi, I was just dropping off the poinsettia. Oh, it's beautiful.
Oh, it's beautiful.
We are going to have such a good party here, no small thanks to you.
no small thanks to you.
Yeah, no, it's going to be a great party.
I just wish that I could be here to celebrate it with you,
but I-- I can't.
What? Hold on, why not?
Uh, well, my sister, she called me and she just wants me
to spend Christmas with her and her family in Denver so I'm going to go do that.
so I'm going to go do that.
Why didn't you mention any of this before?
Uh, yeah, it was just a spur of the moment kind of thing.
Okay, can you not just go tomorrow?
I can't.
I can't because it was just really hard
to get those tickets booked, and so I'm just going to go tonight.
But, look, the party's going to be amazing
and, um, maybe after the holidays, you can tell me all about it.
Maybe?
Hey...
Connor, give Daisy a hug for me, okay?
Merry Christmas.
Whitney!
[Andi] Are you sure?
It hasn't even been a month
and he's just dying to get back to the rat race. Wait, he said that?
Wait, he said that? You know, I thought he had changed.
You know, I thought he had changed. Ugh, I'm an idiot. He's not changed.
Ugh, I'm an idiot. He's not changed. Well, does it matter?
Well, does it matter?
I mean, he is who he is and you seem to really like that guy. That's the problem.
That's the problem. Andi, I do like that guy.
I just can't believe it. I mean, I can believe it.
I just can't believe it.
Love the doorbell.
Kris, hi. Please come in.
I can't stay long.
[Daisy] Santa!
Why are you still here? You should be home getting ready for tomorrow.
I'm on my way to the airport right now.
I just stopped by to give you this. A little housewarming gift.
That is awesome.
It's egotistical of me, I know,
but I thought it would look nice under your tree.
I hope you like bobble-heads.
I do.
And it will.
I'm going to put it on the tree right now. Oh, that's lovely.
Thanks, Santa. You have a great Christmas, don't get too tired,
and don't forget my wish.
I won't.
It's none of my business, Connor. But is everything okay?
But is everything okay?
Oh, yeah. You know, it's just...
Whitney?
Yeah. I just thought things were going well between us.
Well, it certainly seemed that way to me.
Yeah, I just really thought things were different this time.
We both grew and learned what we want to do with our lives. Like...
Oh, well.
Don't give up hope just yet.
Things aren't always what they seem.
And Christmas is a time of miracles after all.
You look fabulous. Thank you.
Thank you.
I have to say, blue was a good choice.
You're always right.
All right. Well, have fun.
I intend to. Oh.
Look, if you change your mind... I know where you'll be.
-Okay. -Okay.
Hey, Andi? Will you do me a favor?
Yeah.
Will you tell Daisy I said Merry Christmas?
Yeah. Of course I will. -Okay. -Okay.
-Okay. -Okay.
-Bye. -Bye.
What's that?
I don't know.
"Keep the faith and always listen to your heart.
Merry Christmas, KK."
You guys made it. Hey, we wouldn't have missed this for the world.
It's always been a beautiful home, Connor, but you've made it dazzling.
but you've made it dazzling. Oh I-- I can't take the credit for this.
Oh I-- I can't take the credit for this. This is all Whitney and Andi.
You know, we'll be sorry not to have you at the hotel anymore. Well, thank you. We had a great time.
Well, thank you. We had a great time.
-Oh, hey! -Hi!
[Daisy] Andi!
Is it true Whitney's not coming tonight?
I'm afraid so, sweetie. But why?
But why?
She just... she can't. But she wanted me to tell you Merry Christmas.
But she wanted me to tell you Merry Christmas.
That's nice, but boy, I really wanted her to be here.
Oh, well. She's missing an awesome party.
I'll tell her all about it when I see her. I'm so glad you came, Andi.
I'm so glad you came, Andi.
Oh, sweetie, thank you.
-Merry Christmas, Andi. -Merry Christmas. Oh, and by the way,
Oh, and by the way, everyone loves what you guys did with the house.
Yes!
Um, I don't want to drag you into things.
Oh, drag away.
Do you know what I did to upset Whitney?
Sure. The job you're considering in LA.
I don't know what you're talking about. She was here this afternoon.
Oh, she probably heard me talking to Freddy. I'm afraid so.
I'm afraid so.
[sighs] Okay, listen. Enjoy the party, have some champagne.
That's an excellent idea.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, hey, Merry Christmas.
Eric.
Why are you ignoring me?
I'm not ignoring you.
Oh, come on.
Andi, I'm just trying to show respect.
I know you don't like me bothering you. No, I...
No, I...
I want you to bother me.
Really?
Yeah.
Please? Oh.
Well, then, you look unbelievably beautiful tonight.
I do?
And that's saying a lot, because I always think you look great.
Oh, that is first-rate bothering.
I know you like country music. I love country music.
I love country music.
Well, Chris Stapleton is playing in Bozeman... I'm there.
Great.
Hey, uh, Whit. Um, look.
So, when you were at the house today
and you heard me and Freddy talking, um...
Look, can we talk?
[Whitney] Yeah, I think we should talk.
Good. So, when you land in Denver...
How about now?
You're here.
Yeah, I'm here.
Look, I need to clarify something.
No, Connor, you don't need to clarify anything.
Um, I know about LA
and I've been thinking about it a lot.
In fact, it's the only thing I've been thinking about,
and I want you to know that I...
I'm okay if you go to LA.
And I am okay if you want to conquer the universe
or if you never want to retire.
None of that matters to me.
I just want to be with you and I want to be with Daisy and that's it.
And I know that now.
Why aren't you saying anything?
Whitney, I was never going to LA.
What?
Yeah. Freddy's on the board of directors for an NGO for an orphanage in Nigeria. It specializes in girls.
It specializes in girls.
Yeah, and he thought because, you know, Daisy,
that I'd be interested in being on the board.
And, let's be honest, he knows the type of checks I can write.
I got that so wrong, didn't I?
Yeah, you did.
Look, thank you for accepting what you thought I wanted.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not leaving Marietta. I'm not going back to LA.
I'm not leaving you.
Everything I said I meant.
I'm sorry. I... Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey. What?
Did you forget already?
Oh, yeah. No more "I'm sorrys." Okay, I take that back.
So, no more Denver?
Oh, yeah, well that... I, I might've, um, stretched the truth just...
I, I might've, um, stretched the truth just... -Just a little? -A little bit, yes.
-Just a little? -A little bit, yes.
Good.
Because I want you here with me. Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah.
So then, uh, what are we going to do? You think we've grown up or not?
I don't know, have we?
I think that feels pretty grown up to me.
-Guess what? -What?
There's, like, eight mistletoes in that house. Oh, I don't need mistletoe.
-No? -No, do you?
Oh, maybe.
Let me get your coat.
I thought you said that Whitney wasn't coming tonight.
You look beautiful.
Thanks.
It's a miracle.
Whitney!
Hi!
Merry Christmas, Daisy.
Merry Christmas.
I felt something strange when I first saw her.
I was bedazzled.
Then the voice inside of me said, "Mehmet, this is it.
She's the one you've been looking for. Don't look any further."
If she hadn't come into my life, I would have been somewhere else now.
-So, someone took my luggage?
Sorry, are you Turkish?
That sounded silly. You just… You just spoke Turkish.
I saw your suitcase,
but I was with the security, so, I couldn't get to it.
It's not your fault.
If I lose my suitcase, I'm finished, totally ruined.
Calm down. Whoever took it will eventually realize it's not theirs.
Did you have your phone number or address on it?
My phone and purse are in there.
Does it have a tag on it?
Yes.
-But it's worn. -May I?
Thank you so much.
My pleasure. We'll find it. Don't worry.
It's ringing.
Answering machine. "Dragon Gift Shop." Then stuff in Chinese. Didn't get it.
A shop in Manhattan. Close to Chinatown.
How am I supposed to go to Chinatown?
I'm going that way, actually.
Well, somewhere close by.
-I can give you a lift if you like. -You're going to Chinatown?
Or are you just trying to be helpful?
Does it matter?
No, you've already flown for hours. Thank you.
-I'll manage. -I don't mind it.
I'll take you there, we'll sort it out, and I'll go on my way. No problem.
When I first saw him, it felt like I'd already known him.
You probably regret crossing paths.
No. I've been in the same situation a few times.
You know that feeling of, "I'll have a story with this guy"?
That's how I felt.
Let's go.
Sometimes I wonder what my life would've been like
if I hadn't met him that day, hadn't gone with him.
This place feels familiar, like I've been here before.
Must be the hundreds of films I've watched.
Yeah, it's normal after watching so many.
-This is the place. -Is it?
Thank God you brought it.
Let me take it.
-Come here, quick. Hurry! -What is it?
Give Dad a call. They want their luggage.
Hello? Oh, somebody has brought your luggage here.
Where are you?
Alright. I'll let them know. Bye.
Now what?
Now we'll go to that hotel.
No, you must be tired. No need. Nonsense. We came all this way.
I won't leave until we get it.
I'm a bit hungry, though. Shall we grab something?
Okay.
You can add it to my tab.
I see. You found a good way to finance your New York trip.
Yeah. I came to New York to con strangers and make them chase after my luggage.
You don't need to con anyone.
There must be millions of guys here who'd buy you dinner.
Was that a compliment?
No, of course not.
Are you flirting with me?
-Definitely not. I'm married. -Oh, good.
-Don't get me wrong. I'm married too. -All good then.
-You'll stay here? -What choice do I have?
Are you sure? We could look for another place.
I should set you free now.
-Thank you so much. -Yes, time to say goodbye.
Yes, go to your friend. I kept you too long.
No, it was a pleasure. I should thank you.
Okay. Have fun in New York.
Same. And good luck with your job interview.
Thank you.
-Nice meeting you. -Same.
Can I have your phone--
What if he doesn't bring your suitcase tomorrow?
I don't know.
What do you suggest we do?
Are you sure?
I came all this way. I have to stay in the room that John Lennon stayed in.
I'll have a drink at the rooftop. Since she highly recommended it.
Feel free to join.
No, I better not.
-Why? -I'll get some rest.
Is something wrong?
I mean, New York, rooftop, having drinks together…
So?
It will be a huge mistake.
What do you mean, a huge mistake? We'll have drinks, that's all.
Let's say I joined you for a drink,
what would your wife say?
What do you mean?
Is there any reason for my wife to say something?
I don't know. Is there?
I don't think so.
No.
Rest assured, I'm not a guy who'd cheat on his wife. Ever.
Big words.
Not if you know yourself.
I seriously don't have any other intentions.
I'll be upstairs having a drink. You're welcome to join.
I understand that you don't. But what if I have?
-Rock star! Drinking water? -I was just waiting for you.
If I had known you'd dress up, I would have too.
Where did you get this?
From downstairs. She's amazing.
She sells lost items down there.
-You have to check the stuff she has. -Great.
You seem happy.
-I'll be even happier once I drink. -Sure.
So, what is it that you design?
Started with jewelry. Now I design hair accessories and bridal headpieces.
I collaborated with a brand in Milan, then in London.
-And now, here I am. -So, you're quite good at it.
I don't get this stuff, but still…
I feel like calling you "Ryan."
Okay. Good. That suits me.
What should I call you?
Ryan, why don't we make a deal?
We'll be together until I get my luggage.
We won't meet again. No calling, no stalking on social media.
-Why are we doing this? -To have more fun, to get comfortable.
If not, we will overthink this.
Well, you're an interesting woman.
Sorry.
Being phone-free feels great.
You should try it.
Deal.
We've been together for ten years. You?
We've been together…
since college.
-Any children? -No.
But…
I want kids. I want to be a father.
Do you have any?
I'm not ready yet.
Kids? We can barely manage ourselves. There are things I'd like to do.
If your husband agrees, it's fine.
Well, I don't know if he agrees.
When you're in a long-term relationship,
you can't tell if it is love or habit. Do you ever feel that?
If that's what you're saying, you have a problem.
Why is that?
If you really love someone,
you don't question it.
A relationship is something that shouldn't be questioned.
If you ask me.
I disagree. You shouldn't take it for granted.
Haven't you ever gotten sick of being with the same woman for years?
No.
Come on.
You apparently got sick of it. Must be why you came to New York alone.
In order to be creative, I have to ditch that routine.
Exploring a different city, meeting people.
And I guess…
I feel the need to remember that I have options.
Why did you come alone?
I came to blow off some steam.
I thought I'd feel good here.
-Let's blow off steam, then. -Yes! To blowing off steam.
I find fidelity overrated.
You do?
-Haven't you ever cheated on your wife? -I haven't.
Get it all out.
You won't see me again.
You didn't answer my question. I did, but you wouldn't take the answer.
You see, if I wanted to cheat, I wouldn't have gotten married.
If I felt like cheating, I would get divorced right away.
If you're happy, if you love your partner, and, most of all, respect them,
cheating is out of the question. That's it.
What else?
Nothing.
-What do you mean? -Do you have any other clichés?
"Lovers don't cheat. Cheaters don't love." Shoot them all.
-Then we can start talking. -Why would I lie to you?
Exactly. No need to be uptight.
Yeah, theoretically, no one gets married to cheat.
But there are times you get bored of yourself, of your job,
of where you live in, of your clothes…
Our relationships don't work because we fool ourselves.
If we could feel free in a relationship, we wouldn't feel the need to cheat.
It wouldn't feel like a prison.
Maybe marriage isn't to blame for all setbacks in a relationship.
What do you think? Maybe it's just easier to put the blame on others.
Especially if you are no longer in love with your partner,
and you lack the courage to say it.
Life is too short to be in a loveless relationship, Ryan.
You smoke?
Sometimes. When I drink. Actually, I quit.
Sure.
The bar should've been here. Look at this.
Remember the Sunday Night Movies during our childhood?
There was this view of New York.
Wow!
You have a beautiful voice.
Good job.
If you'd like to join us on stage…
-No, that's your thing. Thanks. -Okay.
No objections.
I used to watch those films on Sunday nights.
Then it would be bedtime. I'd go to bed and dream of New York.
I'd say, "When I grow up, I'll go there." This view felt so vibrant.
I used to think the same for Istanbul. "One day I'll go there, live there."
The view of the Bosporus is way better.
I love Istanbul.
You can love both Istanbul and New York. Give New York a shot.
I did, but until now, all I've noticed is this stench of piss in the streets.
People seem lonely.
-Smell of weed, and sad people. -Come on.
Let's go by bus.
-By bus? -Yes. Come on.
Are you sure?
-Wait. I'll be back. Stay there. -Let's go. Please.
Let's just go!
Son of a bitch! Where is your knife now?
Huh, pimp?
-Don't let go of my hand again. -And you don't either.
I thought you didn't smoke.
What? Is that mine?
-It was in your pocket. -My pocket?
No way.
Look at the tricks you have up your sleeve, Ryan!
What?
Here we go. Like all of that wasn't enough.
You know you called the guy "bird shit," right?
"Bird shit?"
Really? Did I call him "bird shit?"
The girls were really hot.
How come they thought I was competition?
Well, they must have felt threatened by your beauty.
They must have been annoyed.
Since they felt intimidated,
it's no surprise that they showed their teeth.
Because…
I mean, it makes sense.
Wow! Such compliments!
You started chattering, Ryan. Is it the adrenaline, or this?
I mean, both.
Let's say both.
Nicely balanced.
So, now what?
Shall we go back? While we are still in one piece.
-Let's go to the hotel. -No.
Not to the hotel. I don't want to remember tonight this way.
How do you want to remember it?
Well, we're in New York.
Two strangers meeting for the first and last time.
Let's do something different, something we can't do in Istanbul.
Hear me out now…
Wasn't it great?
-I can't believe you. -Come.
-I'll go to the restroom. -Okay.
This is ridiculous.
A drink?
-No way you're doing it. -Then why are we here?
-Let's leave. I thought we'd just watch. -You will.
You are really…
I mean, really…
-I just don't get it. -Ryan, why the face?
-No congratulating? -It's nothing.
So, you're faking it with your husband too?
Who said I was faking it?
Come on. Night is young.
I had so much fun. Thank you.
Good night.
Serin?
Serin? What's wrong?
The game is over.
Serin.
-Serin… -Sir.
EDA ARIKAN
Eda, hi.
Hi, Mehmet. Sorry if I mixed up the times.
-Is it early? -No, speak. What is it?
I wanted to call you yesterday, but you were busy.
Anyway, I'm letting you know the trial date is set.
Next month, the 20th. At Çağlayan.
At 11:30 a.m.
I just called Mehmet too.
It's uncontested, no need for witnesses.
Only the two of you. It'll take ten, 15 minutes.
Okay, thanks.
When I first saw him, it felt like I'd already known him.
You know that feeling of, "I'll have a story with this guy"? That's how I felt.
I froze when I saw her.
Something inside me pulled me towards her.
She even had a boyfriend then.
I didn't care. I asked her to come with me.
I left my boyfriend and went with him. I didn't think of anyone or anything.
I didn't answer to anyone. Including myself.
I went to Mehmet's that night. We never parted again.
Sometimes I wonder where I'd be now,
what my life would be like if I hadn't said yes to him that day.
Sometimes I wonder
who I would have become if she hadn't been in my life.
I am very lucky
to have had her.
The third year of our relationship, I got accepted to a college in New York.
To study fashion design. I would have loved to go.
But everything was perfect with Mehmet.
She didn't go.
We were in love.
We couldn't let go of each other even for a moment.
Why would she go? How could I let her go?
Then…
My dad wants to meet you.
-Your dad? -Yes.
I think you'll love each other.
Look, son.
She gave up her future for you.
Her life would've been so different if she'd gone to New York. She stayed for you.
You need to get your life together.
How long will you keep doing music?
Get a real job.
Be a man who is suitable for Serin. Okay?
"Be a man who is suitable for Serin."
Honestly…
I felt like a piece of shit.
How would you feel?
We got married in a small ceremony abroad, accompanied by our close friends.
My parents learned about it later.
We casually got married.
Then I got a job.
Wearing ties, jackets, suits…
With that, my music career went down the drain.
I could only perform with my buddies once in a blue moon.
It wasn't the same.
I found a job.
Mehmet was a great support. I'll give him that.
He got a regular job.
We started a new life. We were happy and excited.
Everything was magical.
We were so into each other, we wanted to do everything together.
We made our life decisions
thinking of each other.
We shaped each other's lives.
I guess that's why we're suffering now.
We were both trying to build a career,
but we never neglected each other.
Initially, marriage was nice.
We weren't like those couples who lose the spark after marriage.
-Don't touch here. Just the sides. -Okay. I'll shave here.
My mom used to put me to sleep on my back, so…
You did that on purpose.
Shave it all, then.
Then I started designing for a brand.
More like I attempted to.
She usually gets stressed while working.
She has her own space, own order of things.
You must never touch it.
Mehmet…
What is this?
I was just checking your website.
I saw some models that are almost the same as my designs.
Are you aware of this?
Why wasn't I informed?
They are the same. You just changed the color.
They stole my ideas and fired me.
You have no right to do this. Where's my share for this?
Fuck off, you fucking idiot!
They are well aware. Great!
That's when I first regretted not going to New York.
I sent some of my designs to a place in New York.
I just wanted to try my luck.
I didn't have much hope, but then…
DEAR SERİN YILMAZ, THANK YOU FOR APPLYING TO VARGAND FASHION STUDIO
She'd applied somewhere in New York.
She was to prepare a collection. If they liked it, they'd hire her.
She hadn't told me that. So, I didn't tell her I knew.
I'm home.
Welcome back.
-How are you? -Fine, dear.
Wait. Sero.
I waited for her to tell me. She didn't.
I was afraid he would say no.
Had he said no, I might not have gone. He could've convinced me.
My phone was ringing.
We started arguing, fighting.
She challenged everything I said, acted stubborn,
disagreed with me on everything.
Serin!
Whenever I went to a photo shoot for work, he'd get jealous, and we'd argue.
-Yes? -Where are you?
At a shoot.
Still at the shoot?
I got held up. We're doing my collection. It's turning out great.
My instrument. I'm home, and I can't believe it.
I've told you so many times not to put anything on my instrument.
I'm very sensitive about this.
You act like you don't know how sensitive--
-I'm doing a shoot. Let's talk at home. -What is this?
-Unbelievable! -What?
Serin?
-İyi? -İyi. Yeah.
-Honey, I have to go. -Who's there?
-The crew. -Is it a movie set? What's taking long?
Calm down. Let me finish the shoot.
-We'll talk when I come home. -Or don't come.
-You treat this place like a hotel. -I'm hanging up.
Look who's here.
-Please don't do it again. -What? Am I a sitter?
-Don't disturb me while I'm working. -Am I a house sitter?
What am I at this house? What am I to you?
What time is it? Who was that?
What do you want?
-I worked all day. What do you want? -What did you drink?
-Wait. -What did I drink?
-What do you mean, "Or don't come?" -Who is that guy?
What were you doing at this hour?
I heard him laughing in the background.
-What should he do? Pick a fight like you? -How fun--
Do happy people piss you off?
You were having fun, so why did you come? Look at the time. This is a home!
Who am I to you?
-Fun is irrelevant. This is my home. -Just--
Mehmet…
Mehmet.
CANSU - NEW MESSAGE
HI, I'M BACK SO, HOW ARE YOU?
GREAT TO TALK TO YOU
MEHMET, DO YOU HAVE TIME? I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
I WISH YOU WERE THERE YESTERDAY
PARTY ON FRIDAY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN?
DO YOU THINK THIS DRESS IS GOOD FOR A WORK MEAL?
Whoa.
Yes, I'm listening.
I don't want to be accused like this.
A month and a half ago, we performed in Kadıköy.
Yes, in Kadıköy.
You were there too.
You left early.
If you'd stayed, you would have met this girl.
That's all. She came that day, we ran into each other.
Hadn't seen her for years.
Yes. And if I was up to some shit, I would lock it with a passcode, okay?
There is no secret where there is no passcode.
-Check it any time. -Yeah, you don't even care.
Honey, should I call the girl? You--
-So laid-back. -What? I didn't do anything.
What happened after the gig? Why is she sending you photos?
-Want me to be honest? -What happened after the gig?
Nothing. What do you think?
She came, listened, and left.
-We were-- -Come on!
-We just talked over the phone. Look-- -What happened after the gig?
-Nothing. I finished my drink. -She texts you every morning!
-I dropped her home. She was drunk. -Dropped her home?
-Yes. -Good job.
-This is-- -And? How did you drop her?
Are you kidding?
Did I write anything bad in here?
-Any sign of flirting? -What did you do after?
Am I the reason why she sends me photos of her cleavage?
Might be into me. Why has she been sending photos every morning for a month?
Are you her stylist? "Good for work?" Always with three emojis!
-Her-- -She was drunk, and you had a threesome?
No! I'll be honest with you.
-There was no sex! -Honesty? It's over!
You showed no interest in me. Everyone deserves occasional affection.
And it feels nice receiving it.
Why did you take off your ring?
Mehmet, I've thought about it a lot.
There's no longer true love between us.
We're not good for each other.
We're drifting away in a passionless and dull life.
It's hard to admit it,
but that's how it is.
For you to even think about texting this woman proves my point.
We can't go on like this.
We shouldn't.
I mean, I can't.
I'm really sorry.
I'm writing this letter
because if we try to talk, we'll fight again.
We won't listen to or hear each other.
Defenses, accusations… I don't have the strength for that.
I don't have the strength for an unhappy marriage. Let's get a divorce.
That's it. It's that simple for her.
Just because I texted someone.
If Serin texted with someone from her past,
how would you feel?
If Mehmet applied for a job abroad without telling you,
how would you feel?
I'll ask you something now.
Please think carefully before you answer.
If you met each other today, would you still fall for each other?
We are not who we used to be. Maybe we wouldn't like each other at all.
Yeah. Who knows?
Does it matter now anyway?
We filed for divorce. We're waiting for a trial date.
This is our last session too.
Fine.
Then in this last session, I'll have one last suggestion for you.
Why would I take your passport?
Hello.
To the airport.
When is your job interview in New York?
Next month.
Perfect.
Can you go there together, by any chance?
I want you to act like you've just met each other
for the very first time.
I just want to help you.
Let's go, shall we?
Please.
-It will be a huge mistake. -What do you mean, a huge mistake?
-Don't let go of my hand again. -And you don't either.
I still love you very much, you know.
I really miss us.
Me too. Let's just enjoy it.
Green water.
With ginger.
It can cure your hangover.
-You like this stuff. -Thank you.
The alcohol and cigarettes killed me. Got your suitcase?
Yes.
-Anything missing? -No.
Cool.
You like it?
Turns out, the therapist was right.
Yesterday was good for us.
Yes, I agree.
We laughed.
We were cheerful, like we used to be.
And we talked. We hadn't talked this much for so long.
And we didn't fight.
Not with each other, yes.
-Yeah. -Does your hand hurt?
No, it's fine.
Yesterday, I saw the old Mehmet in your eyes. The Mehmet that wants me.
Do you recall what she said?
"If you met each other today, would you still fall for each other?"
I would.
Yeah, I'd fall deeply for the guy I met yesterday.
But we didn't meet yesterday.
-What do you mean? -I mean, nothing has changed.
The stuff that brought us here didn't vanish overnight.
Last night was one of the most memorable nights of my life.
I'm sure that once we're back in Istanbul, we'll start fighting again.
We'll ruin each other's lives again.
I don't want to be that woman. Grumpy, always yelling.
I don't like that version of myself.
Trying to be myself and us at the same time…
-I can't give you what you want. -What did I ask from you?
-What have I ever wanted from you? -You said it last night.
-I don't want a baby. -Okay.
-I can't. -I don't want to live here. I never will.
Yeah, that's why we'll set each other free.
-Is there any other way? -Thousands.
I told you yesterday. What matters is choosing to be together.
But instead, you're throwing us away by preferring to live here.
-Such a shame. -I'm throwing us away?
It's all my fault, yeah.
You want a divorce, I don't.
-I mean, I didn't. -You could've supported me.
Instead of saying, "I'm here for you," you say "Don't. It'll be a shame."
This is the thing. When it's about your work, life stops.
When it's about what I've dreamed about my whole life,
I'm selfish.
My work?
I gave up myself altogether!
I'm busting my ass to make you happy!
And you're planning to move abroad!
Apparently, that justifies you cheating on me.
I didn't cheat.
You're only fooling yourself.
We know what would've happened if I hadn't seen those messages.
Serin, I did not cheat on you.
Cheating is not my thing.
Remember, it was you who came to me when you had a boyfriend.
Get out!
Will you leave?
We're getting divorced.
The date is set, do you realize that?
It's not child's play.
-I'll be late to my interview. -Your interview.
Your job is more important. So is this fucking city!
Everything is more important than me!
And you say you love me. I mean, you said so yesterday.
Yes, I love you, but I don't want this. Don't you get it?
Fine.
I don't want to be with someone who doesn't want me.
Serin, this is the first time I'm writing a letter.
I don't know if I'll do well, but I'll try.
You may have a point.
Maybe I'll explain myself better than by talking face-to-face.
You were right.
Maybe I couldn't be as good a man as you wanted or deserved.
If I couldn't make you feel that I support you
in everything you want to do or you dream of,
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry
if I made you feel like I no longer love you or get you
even just for a day.
I'm so scared of losing you, that I'm actually losing you.
Yes, we both had dreams when we first met,
and in time, we had to give up some of them.
Could we have done better than blaming each other for it?
I don't know.
But one thing I do know is
that the couples who grow old together, fight too.
They also get tired and bored,
and want to give up sometimes.
There's only one reason they don't.
Their faith in finding one another in that home of theirs
after everything and everyone is gone.
What I call "home,"
and you call "love" or "passion," is actually that faith, don't you think?
I wanted us to have that faith.
I wanted it a lot.
I wish it was us against the world, shouting "We are one!"
I really wish we didn't give up.
Because I…
I'm still madly in love with you.
You still have a return ticket.
If you change your mind, I'll be on that Istanbul flight.
I don't want to settle in another country behind your back.
I get your anger. Sorry.
Got the job?
I won't accept it.
Can we not get divorced?
Come here.
Unbelievable! Is this a joke?
Damn it.
It's gone.
Well…
HARİKA AND THE OTHERS

-Easy! Son! -Let me go!
-Easy! Son! -Let me go! Don't push each other. Get in one by one. Come on.
There you go.
-Good afternoon. -Good afternoon.
I'm really sorry, but can those cuties of yours
be a bit more quiet while playing?
You know, it gets kind of tough to rehearse.
-Thank you. -Sure.
Can you do the same while having sex?
You know, it gets kind of tough to sleep.
Thank you.
Isn't this a shampoo commercial?
You toss your bathrobe away and step in the shower.
Two shots below the ass and two above.
Then you bite your lip and do a sexy look.
Done.
You don't make dolmas in a shampoo commercial.
-I mean, dolmas? -But it's a new brand. I told you.
Babe, you did tell me it was a new brand,
but you didn't tell me the owners are nut merchants.
You said Timo was directing and the name was Belinda.
None of this was discussed when we signed.
I swear we're amazing.
Seriously, bravo.
So, in our first commercial ever, the message we're relaying is,
"Slave away for peanuts during the day,
then come home and keep working."
"Do the ironing, clean the place, make dolmas."
"Be wives to your husbands and moms to your kids."
Is that it? Fuck that…
Did you hear what she said?
All right, Ayça. All right.
I don't want to deal with this anymore.
I don't want to play a member of a shitty family
who has picnics and barbecues every weekend.
Let's just pay our way out of the deal.
Honey, the fee is 750,000 liras. We can't just leave.
-Is that the net price? -Yes, it is.
We'll be ruined, I'm telling you.
When's the shoot tomorrow?
I'm guessing early in the morning.
All right, but the dolma thing…
Dilara, I have to go. I'll call you. All right, honey?
Kisses.
Did you ask the director the necessary questions?
Like, what inner motivation drives Handan's character?
How many colors are in her scale? Important stuff.
Or have you asked her questions of your own?
Like, what's her spirit animal?
-"Spirit animal"! -Stop, guys.
We need to map out her star chart first.
-That's right. You should. -I'm kidding.
But wait. Dilara, look. Joking aside, I have a serious question.
You know, you haven't observed a lot of people like Handan.
How will it work? Have you even attended a dolma workshop?
Listen, guys.
You know, I wish you guys
took your jobs a bit more seriously like I do.
You know what? Forget about taking it seriously.
How about just memorizing your lines? Right, Arzu?
"Oh, babe! What was it? What was the line?"
-Babe, we're just teasing. -Oh, babe!
You know it's all out of jealousy.
Well done, Serkan. You immediately told everyone.
Baby, we're just having a laugh. Relax, okay?
All right, Serkan. The shampoo thing is over. Let it go.
Try to have some fun.
Come on.
Happy birthday to you, Dilara…
You did this, didn't you?
-Enjoy your new age, Dilara -…your new age, Dilara
Make a wish and let it come true, Dilara…
Yay, Dilara!
We're glad you're here…
BELİNDA HAPPY BIRTHDAY! OUR MAGICAL CELEBRITY!
Enough already, honey.
I've apologized again and again.
The cake was Arzu's idea, not mine.
Are you sleeping with her?
Oh, come on.
Look. I won't be mad if you are.
But, if you're lying to me, I'll give you hell, Serkan.
Damn it, Dilara. Let's move on.
She wants everything I have. Everything.
You, the roles I get…
Have you heard what she told Cem?
She told him she would've played Harika so much more competently.
What do you think?
The shortest joke in the world.
Can she even play Harika's shoes?
Can she even play her shoes, let alone the part itself?
Listen. Don't stay in character. I don't want to deal with Handan.
BELİNDA YOUR FAMILY'S MAGICAL SHAMPOO
-Welcome, Ms. Dilara. -Let's get your costume ready.
Let's get you married.
-Sure. -Come, please.
-Of course. -All right.
-Timo! -Oh wow! Dila!
Dila.
Oh, honey. What have we gotten ourselves into?
Tell me about it.
We'll be quick.
-All right. -I'll introduce you to the kids.
-See you. Get ready. -I'll be back soon.
Their names in the script are Mehmetcan and Ayşegül.
Of course they are.
Ms. Dilara.
We love your work.
Thank you.
Kids, meet your nanny.
We told them you're the nanny not to confuse them.
-I see. -Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
You're good.
Hey, Ms. Dilara.
-Can I help you? -Oh, of course you can.
I swear I've been waiting for you to come since forever.
How are you doing?
I'm Necati, your husband. I mean, your husband as in…
I'm Tuncay. I play Necati.
I play your husband. I'm Tuncay.
Let's just…
Let's just take a selfie. As a memory.
If you just come a bit closer--
-Can you please calm down a bit? -Of course.
-Please. -Come, please.
Oh, it turned off. For makeup? The makeup.
Stand here, please.
-Like this? -Yeah.
-Let me see. -All right.
-Done? -Go fix it in the bathroom.
-Off you go. -I'm Necati now.
-Ms. Dilara, I'll share this and tag you. -Sure.
-You can tag and share it too. -Of course.
-Sure. Of course. -It'll be amazing.
I think we should do it that way. Because it's not ready.
-Yeah. All right. -Let's just do that.
Sir, sorry I interrupted your chat.
The analysis says the family is Central Anatolian.
So what about an accent? Whaddya say, partner?
Dude, you don't have any lines in this scene.
Okay.
-Yeah? Okay? -Okay.
-He didn't even read the script. -Come on!
-Is everyone ready? Let's go. -We are.
Here we go.
All right, people. Are we ready for Belinda?
Dude, she didn't take a shower yet. What are you sniffing?
I'm so sorry. I'll fix it.
Handan, be gentle, please.
Believe in Handan.
She's a hardworking Turkish woman who loves her husband and kids.
The mustache distracted me, sir. It won't stay. My bad.
Let's take a break and have some tea.
Is it time for tea?
Three, two, one, go. No! Stop!
DNT STUDIOS
It's not working.
Guys, can we please clear the set
if you're not currently working?
Yeah, guys.
Please.
-Come, sir. -If you're not working, go.
Enjoy it.
Dila, darling, we okay?
No, man. We're not okay.
The water's freezing.
I'm all wrinkly. Look at my hands.
I can't tell if this thing's shampoo or glue.
-Tomorrow? -No, man.
Let's just get this over with.
I won't come back for this shitty shampoo. Let's just do it.
-Are you okay? -I'm ready.
All right.
There we go.
You wash away the exhaustion with Belinda.
You're being reborn. You get this refreshing…
What's wrong now?
Forget about Dilara. Dilara doesn't exist anymore.
I need Handan.
The place, the bathroom, the shampoo… They're all yours.
Channel your inner Handan.
Don't play Handan.
Be Handan.
You can do it.
Rinse your hair.
This is it.
You're Handan and only Handan.
That's it.
You can't do that! You're already out!
-Give it to me! Come on! -No! I won't!
-Give it to me! -I won't!
Give it to me! I won't!
-Give it to me! -I won't!
-Give it to me! Come on! -I said I won't! I won't!
-Give it to me! -I won't! Chimp!
Chimp!
Timo?
Chimp!
-Timo? -Chimp!
Chimp!
Chimp!
Chimp!
Chimp!
Give me my snake!
-Give me my snake! Come on! -It's mine, not yours!
Where's everyone?
Handan?
Why'd you take a shower this late? What's up?
Is this funny to you? Are you having fun with me?
No. I'm playing backgammon.
Where are my clothes?
Hey, Handan.
Timo!
Got trash, Mrs. Handan?
-Handan! -What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Why are you going out dressed like this? Are you insane?
-Mommy's insane! -All right, kids. Shut up. Stop.
Move. Shut up.
Handan, what's wrong?
Look. All right, okay? We had a laugh. We had our fun.
But I'm starting to get angry, Mr. Tuncay.
-I'm serious. -Who's Mr. Tuncay?
Mr. Necati, look…
-"Mister" Necati? -Enough! This is dumb!
What a shitty prank!
Where's everyone, man? Where's the crew? Where's the gaffer?
Where's the director, man? Where's everyone?
Did you guys spike the stupid shampoo or something?
-In the name of Allah, the merciful… -What are you talking about, man?
-Where's everyone? -He yelled at me.
Everyone's here, Handan. They'll be here. Calm down. Stop. It's okay.
It's okay, Handan.
You just stay here. Stay here.
Come on, kids. Come on, son. Come, honey.
Go to your room. Don't make a peep, okay?
Go. Go to your room. Go. Come on.
Handan! Handan, what are you doing?
-Are you crazy? -What are you doing? Mr. Necati!
-For God's sake, Handan! -Mr. Tuncay, let me go!
-You can't go out like this! -Let me go!
Enough! Fuck you, man!
What the hell are you doing, man? What are you doing?
To hell with your stupid prank, with your stupid job, and with you!
Where the hell are my clothes, huh? Where are they?
Is that your swimsuit?
I swear I'll fuck you up. Where are my clothes? I'll fuck you up!
-I'll scream. -All right, Handan. Calm down.
I swear I'll bring them.
Wait here. Don't do anything. Okay?
-Hurry up! -All right.
Just don't go out on the balcony, Handan. Don't go out.
Here they are, Handan. They're both here. That's it.
What are those?
The clothes you wear.
This one and this one. I brought both of them.
Okay. Leave.
Are you being shy with me?
Oh, you fuckface.
Come on, Handan!
Handan.
Handan?
Take this.
-Handan, what are you doing? -Fuck you and Handan, man.
What are you doing, for God's sake?
Where are you going? I'm begging you, Handan.
I'm begging you, please say hi to them, Handan.
All right? Be safe. Let me know when you're there.
She's going to my mom's. She misses them.
I can't. You know, kids.
Anyway, see you.
To Levazım.
Handan.
Handan.
Handan!
I'll go get your money right away.
You broke the damn door!
Pay for the cab, will you? Fuck this, man.
-What the fuck? -Damn that shampoo.
I knew it was going to be shitty, damn it.
Who makes dolmas in a shampoo commercial?
Fuck this shit.
What's going on? Hey!
I'm going to sleep for about a month, Serkan.
Please don't wake me up, okay?
Who are you, girl?
Convenient, is it?
Let's just barge into celebrities' houses.
Get up. Don't make me call the cops.
So you're in it too, huh?
You can't fool me, Serkan.
Just cut it out already.
Come on. Just go pay for the cab.
What's with all the yelling? You scared me.
Didn't I say you could do whatever unless you lied to me?
Serkan, who's she?
-No! Who are you? -What the heck?
-Calm down. -She's wearing my gown too.
We need to make another stop, man. Just drive.
I'll get your money right away.
I handled that already.
-Here. -Thanks.
Here you go.
Enjoy it.
Okay. Just tell me the truth. I won't be mad at you.
Did you all know Serkan was sleeping with Arzu?
Ma'am, it's not just us.
The entire circle knows about it.
Oh shit.
Nice.
Levent, lend me 200 liras. I have to pay for the cab.
This is a bit forward. How about we meet first?
I'm Levent.
For God's sake, Levent. Why would we meet?
I'm Dilara, man.
I don't know you.
Just cut it out, guys. It's seriously not funny anymore.
Cem, say something, for God's sake.
Ma'am, we just finished rehearsal. We'll have a drink and go home.
Yeah, man. It's what we always do.
Right, but we don't know you.
-It's something we do. -Yeah.
How about you leave?
-Don't touch me. What are you guys doing? -Calm down.
-What game are you playing? -Ma'am.
Are you trying to drive me insane?
-Ma'am. -God! Don't touch me.
I'll fuck you up.
-You came here. -Fine!
-I'm sorry. -Fine what?
Move, man!
-Dude, I have a customer. It's taken. -Watch it!
Hey, habibi! It's my cab.
Come on.
God damn you, man.
No, God damn you. Just drive, man.
-If you don't have the money-- -Why would I take a cab if I didn't?
We're going home anyway. I have cash there.
Yes?
-Unit 8? -Yes.
Unit 8.
I'm so sorry.
Can you please drop me off where you picked me up?
373 liras, Handan.
373 liras. What's gotten into you, Handan?
Why would a married woman
spend 373 liras on a cab in the middle of the night, huh?
You left your phone here too.
I was worried sick. I was so worried.
I swear it's not about the money.
What's going on with you, Handan? For God's sake.
Are you okay? What happened?
You took this off too.
I'm begging you, please don't take it off ever again, okay?
It has to stay on.
-We're stuck. -Okay?
Why are you smelling me?
Because… Because I love you, Zeynep.
But you're the heir to the vast Cevheroğlu Enterprises.
No, I'm Fikret. Just Fikret. Just a man in love.
Damn it! Handan.
I'm tearing up, Handan.
What are you doing, for God's sake? Are you okay?
I need to take my dad to manual therapy.
Zeynep.
Can I stay here tonight?
Did you drink?
I need to sleep. Please.
All right, Handan.
This is not how we do things. Let's just not.
Please. Handan.
You squished my toe, Handan. You squished it!
Handan!
Handan, I swear, if you don't open up,
I'll beat you up so bad. I swear--
You need some rest, Handan.
Just take the night. We'll talk in the morning.
We'll have a chat as husband and wife.
Handan, did you drink?
Nothing.
It's just a shitty nightmare.
It'll be over by tomorrow.
It'll be over.
It will be, right?
It will be.
It will be.
What's this? When did she even get this done?
Weird. It's not coming off.
What the heck?
What? How?
What's that, Handan? Is it henna?
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?
This is our bedroom.
When did you get it?
-Last night? -Leave.
You know what, Handan?
It looks amazing.
Just a morning exercise. Huh? What do you say?
-Don't be ridiculous. Leave. -What? Why? Wait, Handan.
Five minutes.
-The kids. Kids! The kids will hear. -Hush.
-They won't. Three minutes. -Kids!
Hush. They won't.
-Necati, just leave. -Just…
-No. No, Necati. -Just wait a minute, Handan. Wait.
-Wait. -Mehmetgül! Ayşecan!
Honey, put that thing down. Your eggs will get cold. Come on.
Mehmetcan, here's your eggs.
Have some bread with the sausage. Eat your bread.
Here. Eat the bread. You too. Have some bread with it.
Handan.
I don't want eggs!
Eat shit, then! Eat it up. Come on.
Here you go, Handan. There.
Hurry up! Eat it while it's warm.
Honey, please turn that down.
Mehmetcan, I want to see you eat your eggs.
Come on. Handan, have some of this.
You'll starve. All right?
You bastard! Eat it!
Honey, I'm begging you. Please turn it down.
Have some bread. You too, Handan.
Come on, already. Everyone eat up.
Listen, Handan.
You know, my parents and Feride will be here tonight, okay?
Please just cook something.
You made me handle the breakfast, but not dinner.
What did you make the other day? Oh, the stuffed melon.
Dad loved it.
And scrub that thing off before you leave.
What is that, even?
Stop it, you jackass. Let your mom eat.
What did I tell you? Eat your food.
-Honey, please turn it down. -Quiet!
Handan, where are you, honey?
You can't keep being late. The manager asked for you.
We were supposed to get coffee.
Stop fooling around and get here. Kisses.
I'm late for work.
Do I have a job?
Oh right.
Handan worked at the bank.
Which bank?

Handan?
Handan!
Handan.
-Handan. -What? What is it?
Why do you keep saying Handan? To hell with Handan.
What? What is it?
Mr. Akif wants to see you in his office. He looks angry.
Angry? Who even is Akif? Where's his office?
Akif, my ass.
Are you Akif?
I have terrible news for you, Akif.
Handan's not here. Handan's dead.
Handan's dead. She's gone.
Dilara's here now.
I'm Dilara.
Dilara Başaran.
I'm an actress, all right?
Look at my face. Look.
Do I look like a bank clerk, huh?
I'm an actress!
I have a Golden Orange!
I have an Afife Jale Award!
Do you recognize me?
Why doesn't anyone recognize me?
Why don't you people recognize me?
I'm Dilara Başaran! Why don't you recognize me?
God help me. I'm going insane. This is driving me crazy.
-Oh God. -Ms. Dilara.
We all recognize you.
For real?
Thank God.
Thank God, it's over. It's all over.
Ms. Dilara.
Not here.
Not here.
Where, then?
Look. I'm suing whoever's behind this. Every single one of you.
Just so you know.
This is ridiculous.
Where are we going?
What is this?
What are you doing?
What do you mean, Handan?
Or… Dilara?
Fuck.
Fuck this shit! Fuck this!
Oh shit.
I can't get out, man. I can't get out!
Fuck.
Snap out of it.
Put that away.
You do it.
I'll fucking kick your ass! Put that thing away!
It's just that I thought we were doing that master-slave stuff again.
-You think I'm happy, Handan? -Drive.
We're almost there.
Drive, damn it!
For God's sake.
You want some? Have some carrots. Here, have some lettuce too.
Here you go.
-Good job. There you go. -Yeah, fill it up.
Hold that.
-There. -All right.
Eat it. There.
Wait. Here's some lemon. I'll give you a lahmacun in a sec.
Have some airan too, okay?
-Mom. -Yeah?
I'm really sorry. This is an exception.
Handan was so tired from work.
-Get the lemon. -Okay.
She couldn't even make kısır?
Here, honey.
There you go. Nice. Have some arugula.
Handan, where did you get this? The place by the coast?
They make the best ones.
I don't like lahmacun.
Shut up. Lahmacun loves you. Eat it.
-Wait for your husband! -He's just parking the car.
Hey, you. Hey.
Here, little man. Fill it up. Come on.
-Eat up. -Bon appétit, Dad.
-Grandpa burped. -Grandpa burped.
That's not appropriate.
Here he is.
-Yeah. -Here he is.
-Eat up. -Come on, Handan.
Come on. It won't taste good cold.
-Here. -Eat up. Let me see you eat.
Good evening, everyone.
Here's my man! Welcome.
I'm thirsty. Pour me some airan.
-She couldn't even make us a few dolmas. -For God's sake, Mom.
What's wrong, Handan?
Handan.
You can't breathe? Speak.
Have some airan.
Be quiet, please.
Please just be quiet.
Be quiet.
-Just shut up! -I'll pat your back.
Quiet!
-Handan! -Oh no!
-Her eyes rolled back! Did you see? -It's the red pepper!
Handan!
Her eyes rolled back. I saw it.
Leave me alone. Just fuck off.
Fuck off.
Please let this be over.
Please.
Please, God. Please.
It'll be over soon.
So, yeah, Doctor,
what I'm telling you might indeed sound crazy,
but I swear it's all true.
I just up and became Handan, the wife of that moron, Necati.
But I'm not, and no one believes me.
I'm Dilara. Dilara Başaran.
Look.
We're only here to listen and help you.
Please keep going.
How did you become Handan all of a sudden?
See, Doctor, I'm an actress.
This was all just a script for a commercial.
A commercial for a ridiculous shampoo called Belinda.
As I was washing my hair with it during the shooting,
I suddenly found myself in Handan's bathroom.
I got completely stuck here.
People I used to know don't recognize me either.
Even Serkan didn't recognize me.
-Serkan? -You know, the…
The actor. Serkan Gürsoy.
He's my boyfriend.
I mean, he used to be.
Your boyfriend… Does Mr. Necati know about this?
I'll tell you once again, Doctor.
I'm an actress.
I challenge you all!
Did you hear me?
All of you!
I do not accept any labels you've put on me.
Bipolar, neurotic, anorexic,
borderline.
I'm not here to make you all comfortable, pal.
I'm here
to live.
To live!
You cannot destroy my existence.
You cannot stop me!
Did you hear me?
You cannot destroy me!
Did you hear me?
I'm not done. Sir, I'm not done. What are you doing? Sir…
-Hey! No! Don't stop me. -Calm down.
-You can't touch me! -It's okay.
-You cannot silence my song! -It's all right. It's okay.
Damn it.
Shit.
They put her in a wheelchair.
You cannot destroy my identity.
I'm Dilara.
Dilara Başaran.
Handan?
It'll be okay, honey. I'm right here, okay?
Don't worry about the vase.
It's okay. We'll get a new one.
Fuck your vase.
All right, Handan. Okay.
Just get better.
She's not herself.
This flavor…
It's real.
It's delicious.
Chocolamilk, the groundbreaking chocolate.
THERE'S NOTHING WISDOM AND REASON CANNOT SOLVE. - ATATÜRK
What is this, man?
Metaverse.
The wormhole.
Excuse me?
You need to start bargaining.
What bargaining?
Denial, anger,
bargaining,
depression, acceptance.
But don't accept it.
Go ahead, lady.
Come join the club.
You're just what I needed.
All I needed was a mentor.
I'm so glad I have you.
Who are you, lady?
Who are you, huh?
Do you know what I've been through? I…
Do not fear.
Some things did go wrong,
but it's not fatal.
Remember.
A door closes,
and another door…
also closes.
And then another.
Play your part.
Just play your part.
So Dilara's completely a thing of the past?
Don't even mention her. God forbid, Doctor.
So I assume you'd like to go back to your life.
Yes. As soon as possible.
But I think I'll go home and get some rest first.
The meds did wonders on me,
but they made me a bit woozy.
You must've missed the kids.
"Missed" is not enough to describe it, Doctor.
Believe me, I yearned for them.
I climbed out of the endless void thanks to you and my children.
What else can I say?
God bless you all.
I felt Mehmet and my beautiful Ayşegül right in here.
Right here.
I missed you so much, Mom! Don't leave again!
-Oh, son. -Don't leave again, Mom. I missed you.
All right, son. Stop, will you?
It's okay. Sit down.
Of course the kid missed his mom.
This type of depression is pretty common among working housewives, Dad.
They call it the…
The white-collar syndrome.
Thank God it's over now.
The bad days are over, thankfully.
-What? -You think he's listening?
Mommy.
-Nothing, Dad. -Son.
Come on. Enough, son.
Enough, already! Come on. Off to bed. Your mom's going to sing "The Sack Man."
Off to bed. Your mom's going to sing "The Sack Man."
"The Sack Man"?
"The Sack…"
Mom, you do it tonight.
She's exhausted, you know.
What? But… Is there anything she can do?
Once upon a time
There was a man with a sack
He took kids
And put them in his sack
And did what the Sack Man does
The Sack Man
The Sack Man
The Sack Man
The Sack Man
Should I just go back to the asylum?
-Motherfucker! -Hey, honey. Come on, Handan.
I missed you.
What are you doing here, Necati?
Where else would I be?
My parents are inside, anyway.
I'm begging you, Handan. Come on.
Handan.
Necati, they'll hear. Necati, don't! They'll hear. Stop.
-We'll be quiet. Please. -What are you doing?
I'm sick, Necati.
We'll get better together, Handan.
I have a headache. Please.
I'll just give you a massage. It'll be okay.
Handan? But… it's still here.
-It looks good too… God! -What?
Mommy.
Oh, Mommy's precious boy.
What's wrong, son? Why are you still up?
Huh? What happened?
I had a nightmare with Grandma in it.
Oh, I'm not surprised, baby.
Come here. We'll sleep together tonight.
Daddy can sleep with your chimp.
-Oh, fuck off! -Language, Necati.
You can't say that. Pretend you didn't hear it, son.
Come on, Mehmet. Here.
Let's go to sleep. Come on.
Handan, he's a big guy now.
Is he really going to sleep here?
-It's none of your business. -That's right.
That's my boy.
My beautiful boy. Oh, Mehmet.
What a bastard.

Mr. Serkan!
-Hi. How are you? -Oh no. You again?
Mr. Serkan, could you please give me five minutes?
Seriously, I'll call the cops.
Mr. Serkan, please.
Serkan!
Look. If you just give me five minutes, I'll explain everything.
I swear you won't ever see me again. Five minutes.
Just five. I'll be quick. Just five minutes.
I'll have a chai tea latte.
Mr. Serkan will have a long Americano and one of your lovely Belgian cookies.
Of course.
What's your deal?
Are you stalking me?
Oh, Serkan.
You seriously don't remember me, Serkan?
I'm Dilara. Dilara Başaran.
Doesn't that ring a bell at all? Doesn't it mean anything to you?
Dilara Başaran…
I'm not sure.
I mean,
you did look familiar the other night.
Maybe I was drunk--
Oh, fuck off, Serkan.
Listen, Mr. Serkan…
I'm going through something really strange.
But I know it's not going to last forever because I believe in my talent.
I believe in it so much
that I will get my life back even if I start over.
I just know that.
As long as I can get back on the stage.
-Are you an actress? -Yes! I'm an actress.
I'm just asking you for a small favor.
I just need you to help me a teeny-weeny bit.
I don't even know you. Why would I help?
But Serkan, you do know me.
And I know you.
I know you better than anyone.
I'm the one who knows what upsets you,
I'm the one who knows what upsets you, what angers you, what makes you cry.
I know you avoided girls in middle school because you were fat.
Oh! I also know you had your lunches secretly in the bathroom.
I know you wanted to play the mandolin.
I know how your dad broke it and made you wrestle.
I know how your mom was addicted to antidepressants.
I know everything about you ever, Serkan.
-You watched Katarsis, didn't you? -Oh, fuck me.
Fuck this.
I think I remember.
Do you want to go back to my place?
What?
Seriously?
I'm desperately asking your help, and you're inviting me to your place?
You'll help me, right?
Yeah.
You will help me, right? Right?
Yeah. I will. Yeah.
You have such a look in your eyes, it's--
When are you going to introduce me?
Look. I'll introduce you, but the rest is up to you.
The actress who plays Harika's sister has a new TV show.
There's an audition.
Come see what you can do. Do you know the part?
Arzu used to play her.
Arzu plays Harika.
For now.
INCOMING CALL HUBBY NECATİ
What is this?
Broccoli soup and salmon.
And a salad.
There's bread too.
God, I swear I'm going insane.
I'm going insane too, Necati.
I mean, what is this? I can't cook for you every day.
Just no. Hire me some help.
Help? Handan, I swear you've lost it.
Hiring help? Are you trying to bankrupt me?
"Hire some help." "Pay for the cab." The salmon…
-What's going on? Why salmon? -Don't yell at Mom! Hire help!
Broccoli soup is my favorite.
It's for us, not for you.
Is that so? When have you…
Call me right now.
They want the money, Handan.
I'll take you down with me.
-Handan. -Handan, go make rice pilaf or something.
Please, for God's sake.
This is such a waste of money.
-Enough, you jerk! -"Jerk"?
If you make me come there, you'll take a swim in that soup.
I'm hungry!

-What the hell do you want, man? -Handan.
Stop calling me all the time.
Forget about Handan already. She's gone. Just move on.
Look. If you ever call me again, I swear I'll tell Necati everything.
-Don't be stupid, Handan. -You hear me? I swear I will.
Just let me speak.
-Damn it! Shit. -Don't hang up.
-What's going on? -Shit.
God, please put an end to this.
I've had enough. Please, God.
I'm begging you. Please end this.
Are you thirsty? Come on.
I owe you all an apology.
Believe me when I say I'm so ashamed of what I did.
But it was all because of the pills.
But I'm off the pills now because I'm okay.
She harassed you too?
We had a small incident.
And you brought her here?
Look, Ms. Arzu.
Believe me, I'm not what you think I am.
I want to apologize to all of you from the bottom of my heart.
I'm a big fan of you guys.
Hey, Levent. She's an actress.
What was your last project?
It was a short film.
How short?
As short as short films are.
I mean, what was it about?
An actress…
finds herself in the shampoo commercial she was starring in
and starts living the character's life.
-It was something like that. -Sounds fun.
I mean… It was so much fun. Sure.
Actually, we need someone for Harika's older sister,
but I don't think you can pull it off.
Sir, let me just do the audition.
I won't ask for anything else. Okay?
Let her do it, Levent.
Do the audition, babe.
We'll have a laugh.
All right.
Let's kill the lights so she can get in the mood.
I've been waking up every day expecting to get the news, you know?
Expecting for you to OD in some shithole.
Even thinking about that
is enough to lighten my mood in the morning, you know?
But then I feel so ashamed.
I ask myself,
how can a person yearn for her own sister's death?
Then you go do something so stupid yet again, Harika…
you make me want to live with the shame.
You make me think,
"I wish she died. As long as she's dead, I'm fine with the shame."
But you just won't, Harika.
Why won't you? Huh?
Why won't you, Harika?
Why are you still kicking?
Why are you still alive?
Aren't you ashamed you're still alive?
Wasn't it your sole purpose to bring me shame?
Go ahead and bring it.
Go ahead, Harika.
Die and bring me shame.
Please, Harika.
Just die. Die and bring me shame already.
Go ahead, Harika.
Die and bring me shame.
Bring me shame, Harika!
I'm begging you. Please do it, Harika.
Die and bring me shame.
Please, Harika. Please.
Amazing.
Dilara, the production crew will contact you with the rehearsal schedule.
The schedule keeps changing.
We rehearse until late sometimes.
-Until late? -Yeah.
All right, sir.
Congratulations again.
-I did it, Serkan! -Serkan.
Come on. I'm late to the set.
Ms. Arzu, I'm so excited that I'm gonna be on the stage with you!
Welcome… Welcome aboard.
All right, then.

-Necati, go snag our usual table. -All right. Come on, Dad.
-Slow down, kids. -Go.
What are you doing?
-You murdered the tomatoes. -I'm peeling them.
Give it here, for God's sake.
Take this. Put it over there.
Toss that over there.
Why isn't Akif here?
He's on a business trip, Mom.
That's how it always begins.
-"Business trips." -What's that supposed to mean?
You couldn't give him a baby.
What is he supposed to do? He's seeking happiness elsewhere.
Enough, Mom. Enough, already.
Shut up. You've embarrassed us all.
Dad, say something, will you?
Please say something.
-What? -Here, Dad. It's nothing.
It's delicious. Taste it.
Hey, honey.
Hey, you.
Feride.
Why do you even listen to them, honey?
Don't pay them attention, please.
Hey, Mommy!
We're upset with you.
Oh, you fuckface.
Hey, bro! Give them here.
-Girl, what? -Put them on Necati's tab.
-I can't drink this. -Oh, you can. You totally can.
I'm going to tell you something, but it's going to stay between us, okay?
It's top secret.
I'm joining a stage play. Come to the rehearsals.
Instead of crying all day at home, you'll be keeping me company.
Plus, your brother won't let me go out by myself.
So just come.
What are we going to tell him?
A cooking class or something.
We'll make something up.
Don't worry. I'll handle that.
All right.
Handan?
Are you drinking beer, girl?
If only you knew what else Handan's been doing.
Asshole.
Are you tired?
We're almost there. Almost. Come on.
All the running exhausted the rascal.
You tired, Dad?
Handan will make you some linden tea.
And some pastry or fruit.
You'll be better than ever and…
Can someone help me out?
Fuck.
Hush. Don't scream. I'll kill you. Don't scream, or I'll kill you.
-All right. -Where's the money?
Where's the money, Handan? Talk!
Money? What happened to you?
Take a look. This happened.
Talk. Where's the money?
Look. They electrocuted me and stuff at the hospital, okay?
My memory's hazy.
So just explain it first. What money?
Are you fucking kidding me?
The donations in the brown leather bag. Where is it?
Why the hell would I have a brown leather bag?
Oh, come on!
Where is the money we've been skimming every month, Handan?
Oh, I get it. You two morons were laundering money too?
Who the hell are you people, man?
-You think I'll believe you're crazy? -Let me go.
We were going to run away. Even the house was ready.
Are you running away with someone else? Is that why you're hiding it?
Well, it's too late. The institution knows.
Handan? Honey?
Handan?
What's wrong?
My poor wife. Are you tired?
Oh, come on, Handan.
Please, for God's sake. The kids need a shower too.
I swear I'll kill myself.
Let's go.
…depression, acceptance.
But don't accept it.
Hey, Handan.
Are you happy?
Maybe you're living my life, right?
I swear…
I'll figure this out.
Do not fear.
Some things did go wrong,
but it's not fatal.
Things just need to go a bit more wrong first.
Play your part.
Just play your part.

"Our institution will pay you one last visit tomorrow."
"We wish you a nice day."
Hey, Handan.
You remember the day we met?
No.
It was my cousin's wedding.
The tables were crammed.
I was thinking about how much I hated my cousin.
Then I turned my head a little.
There you were.
I swear a fire started in me.
Such a fire, I'm telling you.
I couldn't contain myself.
"Oh God. This is bad. What do I do?"
"I need to talk to her."
"I need an excuse."
Then I stood up and came over to your table.
I said, "I'm so sorry to bother you, but this is not working."
"We should either join our tables or push them farther apart."
"People can't pass through."
You took a glance at me.
You kept looking. Then you said, "Let's push them apart."
Oh, Handan. Oh, honey. It's different this time.
This feels so different, Handan. Oh, Handan.
-Necati. -Yeah?
-I kind of crashed your car. -Who cares?
Don't worry about it, Handan. Crash it.
Hey, Handan.
-Can I take a look at your tattoo? -No.
Okay. I won't look, Handan.
Oh, Handan.
Oh, Handan.
Oh, Handan.
-Finally! -Finally, Handan!
-It's there. -It's here, Handan.
It was there all along.
It was here all along, Handan. It was here all along.
DEAR NECATİ, THANK YOU FOR…
My mom will come back, right?
She will.
Mrs. Handan Gülveren?
Here you go. It's over.
I'm ending my business with your institution.
Ma'am, you need to come to the police station.
After you.
Let's go, ma'am.
Excuse me. Can you tell me what this is about?
-The lieutenant will handle it. -Look.
I have nothing to do with any bags, any institutions, or any money.
I'm an actress,
and this is my big day because I'll be on the stage tonight.
Okay, ma'am. Just wait for the lieutenant.

I'm here. I made it.
Sir. Hey, sir.
Sir, I swear there was so much traffic.
Cabs wouldn't take me.
I think you're a bit late.
I'm so sorry. I mean it.
I'm really sorry, everyone. I'll be ready in a second.
My makeup is pretty basic anyway.
I'll take care of it.
No need, Dilara.
Or rather, Handan.
I really can explain it.
Hey, Handan.
Can you explain your husband, your two kids,
and the fact that you're a bank clerk and not an actress?
Did you have me followed?
Huh? Did you?
Besides…
What difference does it make? I'm good at it. Right, sir?
You watched me. You saw me. You liked me. You approved.
And it's not like you guys can go onstage
without Harika's older sister, right?
Oh, right. Yeah.
But we already took care of that.
When you didn't show up yesterday, we called Pelin.
Thankfully, she came right away and helped us out.
Her show's off the air anyway, so we can work without conflict.
What?
What do I do, then?
Nothing, Handan.
You'll do nothing. You're fired.
Fired?
I mean, come on, guys. You can't fire me.
-I'm the reason this play exists. -Wow.
You can't do this to me.
Do you have any idea what I had to sacrifice for this?
Do you know what I had to do to get on the stage?
Do you?

Serkan, say something.
Say something, Serkan.
Sir, can I just be one of the dancers at the back, then?
It doesn't matter as long as I'm on the stage. Please, sir.
Oh yeah. A dancer is a superb idea.
But we're not short.
Honey, it's done. It's over, Handan.
Okay? It's over. You're not in it anymore. You don't exist.
Okay? Off you go. Goodbye.
Let's get back to work, people. Are the lights ready?
I don't exist?
Yeah! Yes! Cut!
Amazing! Beautiful.
We're done!

You were fantastic. Come here, honey.
Bring it here. Get her bathrobe.
Seriously, you were amazing.

And well, here I am.

Oh, Fer! That was silly! You come up with such ideas.
-Enough with the face, Fer! -I'm a bit bored.

I also saw your little lamps, they're so cool.
Still selling them?

But he sent flowers.

But he wasn't reliable.

-Wanna open it? -Come on!
Come.
-Open it. -Yes.
Wow, look!
You've got to be kidding.
-The rules. -Yes.
"Rules."
"Rule number one."
"The Medina siblings swear to take a trip
when they turn 18."
Jeez!
We're way overdue.
-You're more overdue than I am. -Hey!
"Rule number two."
"The trip will start at San Miguel de Allende's historic center
and will be deemed concluded
once the participants reach Acapulco and pee in the sea for the first time."
-Pig! -What?
It was a symbolic act.
I asked for Veracruz, which is closer, but you…
Hey, Acapulco is cool!
Just because of Luismi.
Yeah, because of Luismi's videos.
'Cause… I don't know, all Mexican soaps shot scenes there, right?
No way, Gabo.
When did we do this?
Before Mom died.
It's pretty pro.
Because I did it.
Oh, come on!
"Rule number three."
"During the trip,
the participants must take turns
doing what the other one wants,
no exceptions."
"The youngest one takes the first turn."
Yeah, you wrote it.
"The only event both participants swear to take part in
is eating a hotel's entire room service menu."
Glutton. Of course!
I mean, Dad wouldn't even let us open the minibar.
Hey, they charge you 90 pesos for a tiny bottle of water! No!
Right, that's expensive.
"Rule number four."
"The trip will take place by motorcycle."
Look.
Dude, what happened to the bikes?

Absolutely not.

see where we are?
The historical center is lovely, but let's go home.
No, dude. This is where the trip starts.
Yeah, right.
Hey, you and I, to Acapulco.
-You're hammered. -Yeah, but it's a good idea, right?
No!
You're leaving tomorrow, and I have lots of things to do.
-We can't. -Gabo!
We swore to do it 20 years ago.
Exactly.
You can't make 15 years go away,
come back, and create chaos.
Give me one reason.
I'm not sure I turned out the lights.
No, Gabo, I mean it.
Give me a reason to stay.
Acapulco!
Here we go!
Let's go!
Shit!

-Are you okay? -Hey, what happened?
What happened?
I only closed my eyes for a bit.
Not to mention you're hammered, honey.
Are you okay?
I think so.

Good morning, welcome.
Good morning, here.
-Of course. -Thanks.
-Allow me. -Thanks.
Welcome.
-Your car, sir? -Yes.
One moment, we'll bring it.
Hey, aren't you ordering anything else?
It doesn't seem to be enough.
I've got to watch what I eat.
What? My stomach isn't used to it.
Says the guy who had two bags of Cazares and Miguelito.
That was back in the day.
Now, in Singapore, all I have for breakfast is fish and rice.
-God! -What?
Singapore is the 8th healthiest country in the world.
So what?
You're like me, you can eat what you want and not get fat.
I have to do two hours of cardio a day.
How do you manage to eat all that and stay fit?
I'm like a lobster.
All my meat is on my tail.
But frankly, it's easier for you men.
When us women turn 35, everything sags.
-Oh, please. -Kids are my alarm.
They call me "ma'am."
Not a single "miss," not even by accident.
You drag yourself down to…
Wait.
Hello?
Fuck you!
Sorry.
Everything okay?
A client's jumpy and the jerks can't wait.
Fuck.
Once you're finished, we'll go back to San Miguel.
What?
What?
What about the trip?
Gabriela, I can't take vacations whenever I feel like it.
They need me.
Hey, this was your idea.
I was drunk, nostalgia got the best of me.
Gabo,
I swear we'll find some time and take the trip later, okay?
All right.
In 15 years?
Gabriela, be practical.
We have no clothes,
I didn't bring my vitamins, I mean…
Then I'll go on my own.
-What? -If I don't do it now, I never will.
No, listen, Gabo…
Hey, wait!
Gabriela!
Gabriela, just wait.
You can't go on your own.
-I can't? -No.
You said it, I have nothing to do in San Miguel.
You alone on the road is dangerous.
Oh, please!
What?
I knew you'd chicken out.
I mean…
As my dad used to say, "Let's call things by their name."
That's crap.
You never change.
You always leave me alone.

What's with the disgusting restrooms?
In Singapore, you can literally eat off restroom floors.
Why would anyone eat off a restroom floor?

Hey,

Yeah, man, and mine is more padded.
I'm chaffed.
It's fine, first you chafe, then you get a blister, and then a corn.
That's great.
Okay, where now?
I told you a thousand times,
"Pee before leaving so we don't have to stop."
I didn't have to pee.
But you do now. Hurry up.
It's okay, we won't get a medal for getting there first.
That's not the point, Marisol. The kids don't know about responsibility, damn it.
For Pete's sake, they're 11.
Hey, if you take too long, we're leaving!
-I came with the pee club-- -Just like Dad.
-Did we turn off the lights? -You're paying the bill.
So, where to?
I don't know.
How about the Tequisquiapan Fair?
Fair?
You can say anything you want and you pick a fair?
It's a cheese and wine fair.
Should've started with the wine. That changes everything.
Yeah, I've always wanted to go and never got the chance.
Why?
I don't know, lack of time.
Then let's go.
Let's check Waze, right?
What? Waze?
No, it didn't exist when we were little.
Besides, it's not in the rules.
We take a right and that's it. Let's go.
Okay.
-Ready? -Yeah.
Wow!
I had a blast…
at the fair.
Check Waze, won't hurt to try.
Look.
Let's see.
I bought all kinds of things.
Let's see.
-Complete hygiene kit. -Great.
Tequisquiapan sweatshirts for the cold.
And also T-shirts.
Is that what we're wearing? Couldn't find anything nicer?
I asked if they had anything
from the new autumn-winter collection, they said they didn't.
Damn, that's too bad.
We've gotta be careful with the cash. They don't accept cards here.
Really?
-Hello. -Hi.
-A Sala Vivé, please. -Sure.
-Thanks, how much is it? -Three hundred.
Yes.
Hey, I thought I had…
Do you take cards?
No, no credit cards.
-Hello. -Hi.
I thought I had cash on me, but…
Don't worry.
I mean, it's on me if you want.
No! Are you crazy? Thanks, but no.
It could happen to anyone, right?
Okay, give me three, please. No, I'm kidding.
This feels so weird.
I know it's weird, but it's okay. It's my brother's money.
He works at a bank in Singapore.
-A bank? -Yes.
-It's good banks pay for once. -Of course!
Consider it an act of rebellion by the working class.
That's right, good.
Pretty good.
-Thank you. -It's a pleasure.
-Thank you and the bank in… -Singapore.
Singapore, that's right.
I'll let them know you're grateful.
-The lady's buying. -Yes.
Okay, if you'll excuse me. Thanks.
Bye.
Uh… how much is it?
They opened it.
What? They're still mad?
They haven't even texted me. Guess they think I'm on my way.
And you're not calling them?
What should I say?
"I'm here, enjoying cheese and wine with my sister"? I mean…
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Oh, don't turn around.
-Who is he? Do you know him? -No. Stop looking over there!
You're so obvious, don't look.
Why are you looking at him?
Do you like him?
He's handsome.
Don't turn around, don't be so obvious!
Who's he with?
-He's-- -I know about this stuff.
-I think he likes you. -Oh, please.
The last guy I hooked up with was Beto.
At Marianita Villareal's fifteenth birthday.
Really?
You've been with other guys besides Beto, right?
Sorry, I won't answer that.
Hey, I'm worried about you!
It's been two years since your divorce. Or is it three?
Three years without doing it?
I live in San Miguel, Fernando.
Flirt and next day it's in the papers.
You can't fuck the first guy you stumble upon.
-You know what? Come. -No! What's with you?
-It'll be too obvious. -My turn, we're doing what I say.
We're not doing that now.
The rules are clear.
Rules should be respected.
Or what are we?
Wait.
Oh!
Hurry!
-Hi. -What's up?
Sorry to interrupt.
My sister and I aren't from here, we're looking for recommendations.
Oh, yes, they're siblings.
Yes.
Well, my cousin was wondering.
-Cousins? -Cousins, yes.
-Wanna sit? -Aren't we intruding?
Not at all. If you want, you sit here, I'll sit there.
-Really? -Yes.
Okay. In fact, you paid for this bottle.
-And the bank in Singapore. -Yes.
-Come. -Thanks.
Jeez!
It's nothing.
My sister would've bought you another bottle,
but we're being careful about the cash. Huh, Gabo?
Yeah, that's true.
-Gabo? -No, Gabriela.
Gabriela, Lalo.
-It's a pleasure, Lalo. -Likewise.
All right, I want…
-Time to eat! -Let's see.
Unbelievable!
-This one? -Cheers!
-Cheers! -Cheers!
Cheers.
Our song.
That's it!
No, you!
Come on, let's dance!
Fernando.
I'm great at shopping online.
-That's great! -Buying everything.
I, uh… Oh!
I'm good at putting on lipstick without a mirror while chatting.
That's a huge talent.
Good for you, cousin!
I'm good at
drinking for free.
Lalo, we know that.
Huge talent.
I'm good at…
Gabo, say whatever comes to mind.
Paying taxes!
No, Gabo, no.
Hey, my yearly refunds are phenomenal.
Okay, my sister is really good at keeping things anyone would throw away.
-Huh? -I mean, she's great at inventing stuff.
She has won contests since she was little.
Uh-huh, and you helped me. Remember, with the bikes?
-Yes. -But not that often.
It's so great you get along.
Yeah, we made a great team.
We were even regional ping-pong champions and all.
Tap dance runners-up.
Yeah. What?
What?
-Tap? -Yeah, tap dance.
It's surprisingly popular in San Miguel.
You're not serious, are you?
Oh, okay.
It's true.
Weird, isn't it?
Let's show them.
-What? No, wait. -Sorry.
I don't remember the choreography.
-You don't? -No.
We practiced every fucking day for two years.
The caps for the shoes.
I mean, with bottle caps.
-It'll be fun. -How does it go?
Can you help me? Stick it in the groove.
You'll see me fly on stage.
I can't wait!
Here, in the groove in the…
-Look, it fits in the groove. -Just about.
Sounds great.
Hi, do you know "I Run, I Fly, I Accelerate?"
-Will you play it? -Sure.
-Great. -They're gonna dance to it.
Okay now, get ready.
You'll see the Medina siblings flying on stage.
What a few drinks can do! Wow!
Come!
Look what you put me through, damn idiot!
-Haven't talked like that in ages. -It's ego suicide.
Am I using my heart for the first time?
For you
For me, for two
I run, I fly, I accelerate to be with you
And start the game
And light up the fire of love
I run to be with you
I run, I fly, I accelerate to be with you
And start the game
And light up the fire of love
I run to be with you
Bravo!
Yeah!
So embarrassing!
I haven't done this in a while, okay?
Yes.
I wasn't expecting to do it.
So, I didn't wax or anything.
I don't know what surprise you'll run into.
I'm telling you so you're not shocked.
You're perfect.
-Really? -Yes.
Yes.
Wait.
What's wrong?
Everything's fine.
But I like it…
slow.
Oh, right, right.
Slow, of course.
-Yes. -Yes.
Yes, yes.
Slow.
Have you heard of tantric sex?
-You haven't? -No.
No, no, no, wait.
Come here.
Sit.
Undress.
Yes.
So, you don't live here?
No, this is my grandparents' house.
But no one ever comes anymore, except us when there's a fair.
I see.
It's pretty.
Cozy.
Yes, it's very nice.
It's full of memories.
Yeah, the same thing happened to me when I went to my parents' house.
Sa!
It's a mantra.
For male sexual stimulation.
Oh!
Oh, jeez!
And how do you use this?
This crystal has amassed sexual energy.
I've been amassing it for some months.
Okay, that's so interesting.
Hey, I'm not a prude, but if we're gonna do kinky stuff…
I don't know, at least I should know…
where to put it.
Lie down.
Won't you disinfect it first?
Sa!
Can you feel… the vibrations?
Oh, it uses batteries.
Oh.
Can you feel it?
I don't know, maybe it'll take me some time,
but I'll focus here and give it my best.
Fer, we're not gonna do anything.
Why not?
No, I think I'll go to bed.
No! Wait, it gets better.
What?
I didn't want to wonder how it'd be.
Contain your orgasm.
Hold it.
-Yes, I'll… -Sa!
I'll contain it, don't worry. It won't escape.
Oh, it's so lovely! Sa!
Did you like it?
Is that it?
Everything's so gloomy without you
The seas wash away from the beaches
How did it go?
What a night!
Really?
Why did you turn it off?
I don't like José José.
You were singing it.
Was I?
No.
That was Dad's favorite song.
Was it?
I can't remember.
He played that record almost every day.
He sang that song in the shower.
In the end, his jerk side went away.
I swear.
Cancer improved his personality.
He even became funny.
You don't know what happened one day with poor Aunt Enriqueta.
She told him, "Francisco, don't be afraid, you're going to a better place."
Know what he answered?
"Any place is better than here by your side, Enriqueta."
It's okay to be sad because he died, you know?
Do you know he asked about you all the time?
-He was so proud. -He'd never be proud of me.
I know he was a really difficult guy.
But he loved us in his own way.
He couldn't cope without Mom.
And had absolutely no clue how to raise us.
But old habits die hard.
At first, I hated his sayings. Now, you don't know how much I miss them.
I never got why you didn't leave San Miguel.
I couldn't leave him alone.
No, I mean before he got sick.
That's what I mean.
The battery's charged!
Excuse me.
-Already? -Yes.
It got amazing.
-Really? -Yes.
Is it my turn now?
Yes.
I loved it. I loved it.
It was the best night of our lives.
Sa!
Sa!
Thanks for everything, okay?
-See you. -See you.
-Thanks, cousins! -It's okay.
-We had a great time. -Take care.
Come back soon.
-Of course. -Yes.
Is everything okay?
-Super, and you? -Great.
-Ready? -Let's go!
-Finished? -Yes.
Almost didn't make it.
THERMAL BATHS
Not a single message?
For real?
What if something happened to me?
First, they insist I go back, and now they don't give a fuck about me.
Last night was good, huh?
It was an experience that…
will definitely never happen again.
Ever in my life.
Yeah, the guy had large hands.
So much energy.
Spare me the details.
Of course.
How did it go with the cousin?
Great.
She hit on me,
but it wasn't my time.
Didn't she have large hands?
You're crazy, Gabo.
No.
Stop.
No. Why?
Please!
What is it?
I think we should take them.
This isn't Singapore. Picking up people on the road is dangerous.
Right, they look like criminals.
Gabo, they're kids.
They're hitchhiking. What if something happens to them?
They're coming.
-Think they'll mug us? -No.
-Love… -They seem like good people, relax.
-Hi. -Thanks.
Hi. Where are you headed?
Meeting some friends in Tlaxcala.
Oh, we'll take you.
-Tlaxcala would be a detour. -You wanted to go to the thermal baths.
-You loved them. -Yes, but now it's my turn.
So, suck it up.
We'd be glad to take you.
-Are you sure? -Yes, of course.
Okay, thanks.
We need to see your IDs, though.
Oh, yes, of course.
-Jeez! -Thanks.
Sorry, for our safety.
No, it's fine.
I'm glad…
We'll take a picture of your IDs to send it to our friends.
-And a selfie, okay? -Good, as a keepsake.
-How are you? Hi. -Bros, what's up?
Hello!
-Hi, what's up? -Bro.
Pals!
Hi, welcome!
Thanks.
Hello, how are you?
Oh, can I touch it?
Yes, sister.
Hi!
What's the goat for?
She's part of the family.
I see, you don't eat it.
No, of course not.
So, what is all this?
Basically, we're here to have a collective experience.
Okay.
We share the same time and the same space with nature.
With ourselves.
We go back to the origin.
All together, as a community.
I see, it's a sect.
What?
-No. -No.
This is a spiritual experience.
We believe we are all connected.
That our souls came to this world to find each other.
To form a family of sorts.
-What? -Your hands.
Oh.
Like you.
You are connected through something greater than blood.
Exactly.
Yours souls chose
this place and this moment because they wanted to be together.
I see.
That's exactly what sect people would say.
Don't listen to him.
I was just like you at your age.
When I was a kept kid.
But when you have bills to pay,
things change, you know?
I don't want to live to work.
I want more.
And you want more too.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here, traveling on your old bike,
dressed this weird at 50.
No, hey, wait, 40.
Hey, man!
Age is in your soul. Sorry.
No, wait, I'm not here for my sake.
-You're not? -I'm here for my sister.
What? This was your idea.
You needed a change.
I was doing great.
Please, you're not doing great.
Can I ask you something?
Are you alone or do you have kids, a family?
Well, I… tried to have kids.
For quite a while.
And after seeing many doctors and spending a fortune,
they ended up telling us, well,
that I couldn't.
I didn't know.
It's not the kind of thing you text about in a chat group.
But it was fine.
'Cause if a divorce is awful, imagine it with kids.
This way it was awful, period.
See?
Maybe that's why we had to meet.
So you could tell each other this.
In this life, there's a reason for everything.
Always, everything.
Dessert, guys?
-Yes! -Yes, thanks!
-Oh, yummy! -I need this.
I'll take two.
One more. Oh, thanks.
-It's delicious. -My goodness!
-What is this? -I don't know, but it's delicious.
Shit, careful, they have mushrooms.
How many did you eat?
Hi, beautiful.
I feel we have a cosmic connection.
Yes.
Thanks for this offering.
No one has ever gotten this bad.
No.
Hey.
Thanks.
Thanks for bringing me here…
and for being with me.
Though, to be honest, it would've been amazing
if you'd been there on time.
Not just sent stupid money.
I have a son.
What?
Oh, it spurted out.
But how? I mean, a son?
I have a son.
You mean I have a nephew?
This is heavy!
I have a nephew? For real?
I have a nephew.
That's incredible.
Lights off, brethren!
What are they?
Fireflies.
Fernando?
Fernando.
Fernando, are you okay?
-Hey! -What happened?
Are you okay?
I think I kissed a goat.
You saw the fireflies too, right?
You even told me you had a son.
For real?
Then the mushrooms did hit me.
You don't have a son, do you?
You would've told me.
But, if you do, it's okay.
-Really? -Well, I mean, it's your life, right?
Now you're open and understanding?
Well, since I know you don't have a son.
No.
But what if I did?
Fucking Fernando!
What?
Hey…
I knew it! I just knew it!
Wait, last night you took it better.
I was stoned!
I'm not discussing this hungry.
-Let's have breakfast. -You've no excuse.
I want breakfast.
-I can't talk with an empty stomach. -No! How can you say something like that?
Stop frowning.
Sorry, I can't, I'm still processing it.
Hey, what's there to process?
I had a girlfriend, we fucked, we got pregnant.
She wanted to keep it and I wanted to do my masters in London.
That's how it happened. She kept him and I left.
And it's one more story of Women, Real Life Cases.
And that's that.
As if it was no big deal.
You just blurt it out.
I knew you'd fight me over this.
That's why I didn't tell you.
Hey, what did you expect?
I was a stupid kid.
I wasn't ready to be a dad.
How old is he?
Fifteen.
What's his name?
Ricardo.
His mother chose the name.
I like it.
Hey, does he know about me, his grandparents and all?
I don't know.
We've never talked.
His mom and I agreed that, if I wasn't gonna be in his life,
I shouldn't contact him.
And where does he live?
In Mexico City, with his mom.
-Perfect. -What?
It's on our way.
-Let's go see him. -You're nuts.
He's all the family we have left, Fernando.
Besides, it's my turn. I get to choose, you do as I say.
-No, wait… -Whatever I say, no exceptions!
Rules are rules, or what are we?
See that, partner?
Yes.
Pull over.
They'll definitely want something.
Let me take care of this, please. Keep quiet.
Why?
You have issues with authority, you know it.
Oh, please!
Just look at them.
In Singapore, all policemen are like the ones you see in Bruce Lee movies.
-Shut up. -Look at them!
Morning, young lady.
How are you, officers? Everything okay?
Morning.
-Where are you coming from? -San Miguel, we're going to Mexico City.
And you're driving without a helmet.
Yes, we know. We had a huge emergency.
We had to leave quickly. He barely got dressed, as you can see.
Imagine him taking a helmet.
Helmets save lives, miss.
I know, but we're going through a family tragedy.
Our dad died.
What happened to him?
Cancer.
That sucks, that crap also took my grandma.
I'm so sorry.
-Thanks. -That shit spares no one.
No one.
But that doesn't excuse the helmet.
I know, sorry. It won't happen again.
I swear, officer.
Well, okay now.
How much to let us go?
Come on, guys!
We all know a bribe solves everything in this small town. What?
Tlaxcala isn't a small town.
In the Free and Sovereign State of Tlaxcala,
helmets are required.
Yes, we know. We know.
But this is what happened, what can we do in such a case?
STATE OF MEXICO ENDS HERE TLAXCALA STARTS HERE
He's dressed like a table dancer.
-Look, I'll make him jump. -Yeah.
Cut it out! Fuck you!
Cut it out!
Stop!
Get lost, fucking loser!
Lowlife!
Long live Tlaxcala, assholes!
Fuck you!
Hey, this hotel is cool.
Yeah, right? It's nice.
I have bruises on my legs.
You do?
Oh, my back is killing me.
Come in!
Wow!
Should I close the door?
Yes, we're not expecting anyone. Close the door, please.
Why the rush? You made me get out of the shower.
Well, I've been thinking a lot about something and I want to talk.
Wow! You got a living room and all?
Yes, you didn't?
I didn't!
That's weird, we paid for the same type of room.
This is a terrible idea.
Frankly, it is.
Splurging money on a hotel room is stupid.
-No, not that. -What?
Coming to meet the kid.
I think it's like that girl said, everything happens for a reason.
The rain, the cops. I guess the universe didn't want us to come.
Don't tell me you're not dying to meet him.
It's not that I don't wanna.
I think it's too late.
I don't think he wants to meet his asshole father.
Hey!
You're not such an asshole!
If you compare me with a serial killer, I'm even cool.
You love people thinking you're mean,
'cause you're a softie.
But look at you, you're here.
You could be in Singapore and you're with me.
No.
What?
I know what you're trying to do.
You want to convince me to go see the kid.
-Sorry, but no. -Where are you going?
-Anywhere but here! -No.
-Let go of me! -You're not leaving!
He's my son!
It's my business if I don't wanna see him.
-You wanna see him! -It strikes a nerve.
Because you couldn't have kids…
Sorry.
Sorry, I didn't mean it.
Fuck, Gabo!
I bit myself.
You're right, you are an asshole.
I try to believe you're not, but you always disappoint.
Gabo, sorry.
I can't believe you don't regret abandoning him.
I do regret it.
I regret leaving him,
leaving you, leaving my dad.
It's something I still struggle with.
Look, if you're gonna scold me, I need a tequila.
What are you gonna do?
-Two hundred pesos. -Crooks.
Yes.
Room service?
Rule number three.
The last slice, or what are we?
Try crème brûlée.
Gimme.
Oh, I can't breathe.
I'll go throw up in my bathroom.
Good night.
Bye.
Gimme.
Hey.
Is this jacket too much?
How do I look?
Let's see.
It's fine.
Like a cool adultescent.
You should've bought something else. I mean, just tennis shoes?
Hey, I also bought the jeans. It was all so expensive.
If I took too long, you would've chickened out.
No.
Can I ask you something?
Only if it's not a stupid question.
Is there anything you regret?
It is a stupid question.
Hey, I did my part last night. It's your turn.
When I see your life,
I feel like…
maybe someday I could've been like you.
Sure you could've been like me.
I thought you'd end up working for NASA or something.
Yeah, sure. No use crying over spilled milk.
What the fuck is that?
I mean…
Can you believe my passport is valid?
I always renew it, but never use it.
But it kind of gives me hope I'll travel someday.
-Want some? -No.
How do you know they live here?
It's the same apartment she lived in with her mom. They never moved.
How do you know they never moved?
Social networks.
You've been stalking them?
-Is that them? -Yes.
Tell them I said hi.
Yes, of course.
Eat.
Sometimes it's 8:00 p.m. and you haven't eaten.
I love you, Mom.
I'm glad he looks like his mom.
We saw him, let's go.
The check, miss.
Gabo, wait. What are you doing? Wait! I'll leave it here, miss.
Wait!
Hush, shut up. Stop talking.
-Just walk normal. -What are you doing? Wait.
Just come!
Huh?
Hi, Mrs. Lourdes, how are you? Have a good day.
That's a nest, right? A bird.
You suck as a stalker.
He seems kind of dumb.
Why do you say that?
Give him a chance.
What if he's like his mom?
Oh, please.
Look, we've been following him and he's clueless.
Three, two, one, go!
-Kick it to me! -Pass it!
Take it from him!
-Goal! -That's it!
Keep sharp! Keep sharp!
Strike!
Well, he's good.
Like Hugo Sánchez with Real Madrid, that good.
Wow!
Goal!
See?
He's better than you.
The ball!
Hey, the ball!
You can throw it.
Pass it to me.
Hey.
-Can we play? -For real?
-Gabo, wait. -You need experience.
-Hey, Gabo. -Come on.
Gabo. Hey, no, wait. We're only three.
It's true, you'll crush us.
Right, I'll play with you.
Okay then.
-Go on. -Let's go.
Shadow him.
Come on, Gabo!
Here, Gabo!
Goal!
You're amazing.
Of course, she's great.
In school, she'd make the boys look bad.
Gabo! Gabo!
Shadow him!
Here, kiddo!
Yes.
-Strike! -Gabo!
Goal!
Oh, shit.
That was good, huh?
You play really well.
Thanks.
Oh, no, please!
Look at that. Aren't they sweet?
They're famous in the park.
-Really? -Yes.
They've been married 50 years.
Then, he got Alzheimer's.
She had to take care of him.
But it was too hard, so they put him in a home.
Then, she got Alzheimer's too.
They sent her to the same place as him.
And they didn't remember each other.
Here's the best part.
Every day, whenever they meet, it's as if they met for the first time.
And every day, they fall in love again.
You're pulling our leg.
It's true!
-Like in the movies? -Why would I lie?
For real?
I knew it. See?
But it would be cool if it was true.
Well, we've gotta go, so…
Well played.
-Bye. -Bye.
-Bye. -Well played.
You too.
We don't need a paternity test, do we?
The kid is cool.
Hey, and he looks like you.
Well, he's cuter.
And nicer.
And taller.
Okay, done. You spoke with him. Hope you're happy.
The tough part will be telling him you're his dad.
I mean, we could go with the classic…
"Ricardo,
I am your father."
I'm not telling him.
What? I mean, we met him.
He's fine, he's happy.
He can go on with his life, so can I.
So, we did this for nothing?
He's better off without me.
Fer,
I saw you glow.
I've never seen you so happy.
You can't tell me you're not doing anything.
Although, well,
it's no surprise.
-No, it's no surprise. -I mean…
I mean…
Whenever you see a responsibility, you run away.
You're really something.
It's okay to regret stuff,
but you also need to correct your mistakes, you coward.
Wait. The only coward here is you.
You're saying I left you. Okay, I admit it. I sort of did.
But I'm not the only reason you stayed in San Miguel, neither was Dad.
Don't twist things around.
I'm not twisting things around.
But you always use us as an excuse.
You're afraid of going out and messing things up.
But here's some news for you, when this trip is over,
you'll go back to your same old boring life.
Yeah. Okay now, great.
Yes, I'm the one who makes up excuses.
Great. What about you?
What?
What do you do?
You act aloof, "Yeah, I don't care about anyone."
When you actually lead a shitty life.
You've a job where nobody cares about you, a balcony you don't use.
At least it's my balcony.
I always thought you and Dad were alike.
But you're the true son of a bitch.
You're crazy, Gabo.
Enough, silent blessing and fuck it all.
-I'm out of here. -Sure.
You're such a drag.
Honey, the keys.
Hello?
Hi, Daniela.
Who is it?
Fer.
Fernando Medina.
Oh.
How are you?
Hey, I don't want to be rude,
but I'm having dinner with some friends.
Can I call you later?
Yes. Yes, sorry.
Hello?
I lied to you, I'm not with anyone.
I just didn't want to talk to you.
Yeah.
Yes, I thought as much.
Are you in Singapore?
Uh…
Yes. Yes, I'm here.
What time is it there?
Uh… Oh, here, it's about…
No, sorry. Sorry, no.
I don't want to lie to you.
I'm here, in Mexico City.
Yes, I know.
I can see you.
What are you doing here?
My dad died.
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to know how you're doing. You look good.
You look like crap.
Hey…
Did you finish your doctorate?
Ages ago.
And Ricardo?
What do you want to know?
Does he need anything?
How is he doing in school?
Did you vaccinate him?
I'm worried.
You know, they're using nanotechnology in vaccines, so…
What do you want, Fernando?
I don't know.
Since my dad died… I can't stop thinking about Ricardo.
Or maybe the remorse is torturing you
and you wanna talk to him to feel you've done your part.
Go back to Singapore and forget about him once again.
If you want to see him, it'll have to be for real.
Do you think you can do that?
Uh…
Goodbye, Fernando.
WELCOME TO MORELOS
Thanks.
Gabo!
Fuck you!
What?
I said fuck you!
I can't hear you, you'll have to speak up!
Fuck you.
Come on, sorry.
Come on, dude.
I love you!
Let's see.
The clutch is loose.
-Exactly, that's what happened. -Let's see.
You don't need help, Brother?
No.
You were right.
Yes, I know.
About what?
I'm a coward.
No, wait, don't listen to me.
Yes, I mean it.
I stayed in San Miguel 'cause it's my comfort zone.
Gabo, you're braver than me.
If we're here, it's because of you. I wanted to go back.
Look.
In a week together,
we traveled, there were fights, cops, a nephew.
There was even tantric sex!
-What? -Nothing.
I did stuff I would've never done, really.
Okay, yes. Explain tantric sex.
You inspire me to do things I'd never do.
Okay.
Can we please go back to the tantric sex?
I'm trying to tell you something nice.
I need you too.
Without you,
I'm a jerk.
Yeah, you are, frankly.
Maybe that girl was right.
Our souls are connected and search for each other in times of need.
Oh, I can see you in that sect.
Oh!
-Wanna play? -I pass.
No, you don't. Come.
-Come, drop the spoon. -Thanks.
-Can we play against you? -No.
Bummer! Come back and eat.
-Come on. -No, let's bet.
Let's make it interesting.
-500? -Think that's interesting?
I know… my watch.
Damn, it's from a flea market.
Flea market my ass! No, it's a limited…
I know, the bikes.
-If you win, you keep them. -No. What? Wait.
-Are you crazy? -Those?
Yes.
-They're crap. -They're not crap. What's with you?
They're Carabelas from the '80s.
They're classic.
Original parts, new breaks. I just installed them myself.
There, they're worth something.
-You have nothing to lose. -No?
No.
-Deal? -Deal.
You're on.
Okay, deal. Let's do it.
-Come. -Sorry, that was stupid.
Hey, we started the trip as a game, we'll end it playing one.
Oh, lovely symbolism, but no.
Not the bikes.
Hey, don't worry.
I'd never jeopardize them.
Look, the guy seems old.
And the kid, well…
They won't beat us.
What if they do?
They won't! I've been watching them, they're not that good. Come on.
We'll crush them. Come on.
-Okay now. -Ready?
Eleven points wins.
-Okay then. -Yeah.
-Yeah! Great! -That was good!
One-nil, okay.
-Fuck, you got in the way! -Two-nil.
-That's it! -Good.
-We'd crush them? -You're not trying.
I just ate!
Then burp.
Okay, enough.
Oh, yes.
-Hey, ladies, play, will you? -Right.
-We're waiting, mister. -Bring it on.
Goal, man!
Time to swap sides.
There you go!
That was great!
Keep it up!
That's it!
Well done!
Ten-ten, match point.
Keep sharp, I'm telling you!
-Okay now. -Dad.
Let me serve.
Okay.
But don't mess up.
No, sir.
Your turn.
Come on!
-Good one! -We won!
-We beat them, man! -We won!
-There! -Yeah!
Well done!
What's so funny?
Nothing.
-Give 'em. -What?
The keys.
No, wait, no… Can we renegotiate?
Renegotiate what, asshole? Keys!
No, sorry, there's no need to be aggressive.
-Butt out. -Stay out of it, crazy lady.
-Are you okay? -Oh, no.
-Does it hurt a lot? -Put some soap on it.
Soap.
There?
Think it's broken?
Oh, I don't know.
See? You're not such a jerk.
-You let them win. -So did you.
You're right.
My dad gave us the bikes because he knew we'd need them someday.
What are we gonna do?
Duplicate.
Let's go.
Let's go! Hurry!
Come on! Quick!
Run!
But when I saw him…
Damn.
We won fair and square.
-Did you think I'd punch her? -No, you wouldn't.
-It won't start. -What?
-It won't start. -It won't? What about mine?
The bikes!
Fuck!
Jump on!
Wait, wait!
Get moving!
Catch 'em!
Damn, my bike!
Hey!
Hey!
Acapulco!
It's never too late! Ever!
Welcome, Sister.
-We made it! -We made it!
Okay, pose.
Wait.
Ready?
We did it!
This is so nice!
Feels nice?
Uh-huh.
Feel something warm?
You peed?
Rules are rules, they must be respected.
Okay.
No! Don't be disgusting! No!
The current is coming this way.
Or what are we?
Oh!
What happened?
We're here.
-We're home? -Yes.
Wait.
-Mission accomplished. -We did it.
Is everything okay?
You twisted my finger.
What?
Stupid me! I told you I left the lights on.
Oh, well…
Thank you.
Look.
So you don't forget this trip.
I'll keep the T-shirt so I don't forget.
I love you, idiot.
I love you.
I'll miss you.
And I'll miss you… a lot.
Take good care.
Dear passengers,
we remind you to keep your personal belongings in sight
at all times.
If you find any suspicious luggage,
please report it…
Hi, good morning. Where are you traveling?
Everywhere.
Fer?
Hi, Ricardo.
The animals in this film were not mistreated.
-On your left! -[purring]
-On your left! -[purring] Hot tray. Watch your back!
Aw, Custard, the leaves are falling!
Looks like Frightfall is almost here!
I can't wait to see what new adventures we're about to "fall" into.

There's no time for a peppy musical number!
I've arranged for The Berryworks to supply all the food for The Frightfall Fun Fair,
and I am totally freaking out!
Please tell me we've got terrifying treats!
Uh, I don't want to brag, but we really outdid ourselves this year.
Our food is fun, frightful, flantastic!
Bread Pudding is gonna be totally blown away.
The Extraordinary Berry is-- We know.
Strawberry Shortcake, overachieving as usual.
But what about everyberry else?
Orange Blossom?
Grape, with a Scary-Berry twist.
I recreated the exact apple cider J. Quincy Cupcake served
at The Berryworks' first Fright Fall celebration.
The Cauldron Cup 3000!
Turns any drink into a spooky witch's brew.
I can fix that.
Lime Chiffon, educational.
Lemon Meringue, explode-y. Blueberry Muffin?
I've almost finished my Harvest Medley ice cream!
I just need inspiration for the topping.
A maple leaf. Of course!
Natural and nutritious.
Right!
Raspberry Tart?
Raspberry Tart? I whipped up my award-winning tarte a la citrouille.
That is, pumpkin tart, but fancy.
I'd be jealous, too, if it weren't me.
Not bad.
"Not bad"? These terrifying treats are terrific!
Fright Fall is almost here,
and everyberry is feeling that spooky, scary spirit!
[flatly] Everyberry but Huckleberry Pie.
Aah! Spiderwebs!
Aah! Pumpkins!
Aah! Lamppost!
You okay, Huck?
Sorry, Strawberry. I know you love Fright Fall.
Maybe I would too, if I were brave like you.
Well… not everyberry can be brave like me.
You don't have to love spooky stuff like ghosts, or monsters, or…
lampposts.
I see a lot of standing around.
You berries got my food ready yet?
[grumbling] Oh… sprouts today.
No respect for hard work.
Yeesh. Someberry buttered the wrong side of his biscuit.
Crusty Muffin.
That grump runs the fun fair.
Ironic, don't you think?
[corncob] He's not so bad once you get to know him.
You see the talking corncob too, right?
Good.
Last time I talked to a vegetable, things got weird.
Crusty Muffin is my uncle.
But he's so grumpy, and you're so cute!
I get that a lot.
I'm Strawberry Shortcake!
This is Orange, Lemon, Lime, and Blueberry.
I'm Candy Corn,
at least when I'm not Corny the Cob. Whoa…
that's pretty cool.
Made it myself.
Been helping my Uncle with his fun fair ever since he started it back in Niblet's Hollow.
Shut the stove door! You're from Niblet's Hollow?
I'm from Berryville!
We're neighbors!
Didn't expect to meet another country berry.
Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect
when Uncle Crusty said the fair was coming to Big Apple City.
She sounds like I did when I moved here,
and now this berry gets to help someberry else
fall in love with Big Apple City!
I know Big Apple City can seem loud and overwhelming,
but everyberry here loves celebrating the holidays
just like berries back home!
I'm sure there are new friends out there waiting to enjoy your carnival!
'Sup, Spice Squad?
It's everyberry's fave fall friend, Pumpkin Spice,
here with the deets on the Do's and Don't's
for fall in Big Apple City.
Today, I'm checking out the Fright Fall Fun Fair.
Is it spicy?
Or is it dicey?
Ooh, she seems nice.
Go say hi! Uh…
Hey, sprouts! -Corny the Cob here! -[hip bump]
Fright Fall Fun Fair?
Definitely dicey.
"Like" and subscribe for more hot tips,
and remember, love you, mean it, Spice Squad!
You didn't let her finish.
You barely even let her start!
[Candy] It's fine.
Right now, scary is trending, not cute corn--
What is this, a log? -[Candy] Cob! -Whatever.
-[Candy] Cob! -Whatever. If I show that on my channel, traffic goes way down.
I need spooky, scary, shocking!
If anything totes terrifying happens, DM me. K? Bye!
DM me. K? Bye!
Okay, that wasn't a great example,
but trust me, everyberry else is super nice!
[Pieman shouting] This is an outrage!
Almost everyberry.
First, you wouldn't let me put up a booth at the fair.
Now you won't let me put up one measly sign?
At this fair, what I say goes!
The Berryworks is handling the food, not you.
So hit the purple brick road, Pieman!
You think you can intimidate The Peculiar Purple Pieman?
Well… you can,
but I… will have my revenge!
There's always a few rottenberries in every bunch,
but everyberry else will love the fair!
[Johnnycake Cobbler] Smell that lovely fresh fall air!
Who doesn't love a fun-filled fair?
Johnnycake Cobbler's Ring Toss Stand! Very best in all the land!
You tryin' to cheat my customers?
I resent that accusation. I'm the most truthful berry in the nation!
[chuckles nervously] Wow, is that the time? I, uh…
[groans] Some days, I just don't know if this fair is worth it,
but then I remember my sweet little Candy loves this fair as much as I do,
and that makes all the difference.
Isn't that right?
You betcha, Uncle Crusty.
Hey! Why aren't those booths set up?
Aw, you and your uncle are so sweet.
You know what? As your brand-new berry besties,
You know what? As your brand-new berry besties, we are gonna make sure
your first Fright Fall Fun Fair in the big city is perfect!
Nothing's gonna get in our way.
No freaky fall weather, no berries with bad attitudes,
not even a marauding monster could stop us!
This is gonna be the funnest fun fair that ever… uh… funned!
-[cheering] Yes! -Yippee! -Yay!
"Funned" isn't a word.
You berries are so nice!
I bet we can make this a fun fair to remember! [giggles]
Oh, yeah.
Hot cross buns!
What happened?
This is awful!
Oh, no, look!
Candy, I'm so sorr--
Sorry. I'm a nervous strummer. [clanking] Aah!
-Aah! -Nothin' to see here. Just a couple of small repairs.
Everyberry go have fun.
Well, go on, now! Get!
I know I always have the most fun when someberry orders me to do it!
Candy Corn, I'm so sorry.
I guess some of these cityberries don't want us around.
That does it!
Someberry trying to ruin the fair is bad enough,
but making a sweet berry like Candy Corn not feel welcome in Big Apple City? Ooh, that really burns my bundt cake!
Ooh, that really burns my bundt cake!
Don't go to any trouble.
We are going to every trouble!
I vow to you that we won't stop till we find the culprit,
'cause that's what berry besties do!
So, what do we do, Shortcakes?
I did not think that far ahead!
[Lime Chiffon] Good thing I did.
Wait, how-- How did you change so fast?
Did you have that costume on you?
I've read enough Apricot Christie novels to know that a good detective is always prepared
to know that a good detective is always prepared for a mystery to present itself.
A good detective also supplies her own sound effects.
First we inspect the crime scene…
Sturdy.
Someberry would have to be very strong to break it.
Curious.
These look like claw marks.
-Curiouser. -[Orange Blossom] Ugh!
I've been slimed!
Elderberry sauce?
Curiousest!
Did you say… "elderberry sauce"?
There was a story when I was growing up
about this monster who leaves a trail of elderberry sauce, and… and…
and it's obviously not that!
Is it hot in here?
Why are you still recording?
It's probably just someberries pulling a Fright Fall prank.
Mystery solved, you're welcome!
Totally!
Someberry must have snuck in after the fair closed.
It's definitely that and not a monster.
There's a monster now? [screams]
Yeah, sorry, that's on me.
Tonight, we stake out the fair and find out exactly who's behind this dastardly…
-[anxious guitar strumming] -Huck!
A stakeout? Like… [gulps] …in the dark?
I'll stay with Huckleberry.
Someberry should keep an eye on The Berryworks anyway.
Just… please stop strumming!
Fumbling around aimlessly in the dark isn't really my thing.
[flatly] I'll stay too.
I can't take all this excitement.
Then it's settled. Tonight, we commence Operation
Tonight, we commence Operation "find the vandal berries who are definitely not a monster
and support our new friend, Candy Corn, to show her life in the city is totally fine and not scary"!
to show her life in the city is totally fine and not scary"!
Eh, I'm still workshopping mission names.
[together] Operation "Placeholder"!
[Raspberry] Tarte à la citrouille?
It's French, so you know it's good!
Does anyberry want a pumpkin tart?
Why is noberry stopping?
It's the vibe!
This monster thing is creeping berries out!
And he's not helping.
♪Oh, life is nothing but endless fear♪
♪Terror and madness year after year…♪
For the sake of everyberry's sanity, let's figure this out!
What is it you don't like about Fright Fall?
The tone. The mood. The ambulance.
Are you trying to say "ambience"?
No, the ambulance!
I get scared, I fall and get hurt,
the ambulance comes and takes me away! We'll unpack that later.
We'll unpack that later.
Right now, we just need to find something about Fright Fall you love.
Not everything has to be scary!
It would be nice to not be scared.
You really think you can help him?
It's not like we're getting any customers with him screaming all the time.
So, it's time for--
Fright Fall 101!
Welcome to your crash course in holiday self-expression!
You look amazing!
But what does this have to do with Fright Fall?
[chuckling] Hello!
Fright Fall? Costumes? Dressing up?
And your look doesn't need to be scary! See?
Honey Bee-lightly's dress from my fave movie,
"Breakfast at Mulberry's."
It's perfect. It's flawless.
It's me,
and I'm generously offering you
the use of my sacred costume trunk to find the "you" you want to express!
This isn't gonna work.
Trust me.
[Huck] I am…
[voice echoes spookily] Angry Eyebrows Huck!
That is technically barely a costume.
But wait, if I'm Angry Eyebrows Huck,
what happened to Regular Eyebrows Huck?
Where does the costume end and Huck begin?
Who even am I?
I think the costume is giving him an existential crisis.
Awesome.
If we're gonna find whoever is behind this,
we should spread out to cover more ground.
I'll watch the entrance to the fair, to spot anyberry trying to sneak in.
[Orange] Good thinking, Candy!
Everyberry else, be stealthy, quick, and quiet.
We've got a bad berry to catch.
Good thing I made… The Grabber 3000!
I-I can fix that.
Kinda spooky, huh?
I mean, not for me.
I'm not scared.
Just checking on you, you know?
Oh… [chuckling in relief] Just a trash can.
Nothing to worry about. -[creaking and splintering] -Aah!
What was that?
Very funny, Orange.
Making weird monster sounds to scare us?
No, seriously. I genuinely laughed.
That wasn't me!
And that wasn't monster.
Monsters talk more like--
Then who was it?
That sound could've come from anything.
The wind through the trees, or that old creaky log,
or those red glowing eyes!
-Run. -[all screaming]
This is not great.
[berries calling] Strawberry?
[voices echoing] Where are you?
This way! Hurry!
-This way! -[rustling]
I can't find you!
Custard!
I've never been so happy to see you in all my life!
-[hisses] -Custard? What's wrong?
Gotcha.
We're gonna need a bigger grabber.
Where were you? Are you all right?
We were so worried!
[breathing hard] We were-- -It was-- -[Candy breathing hard]
Something just ran through the park!
It was… an it!
A giant it!
The Beast from Berry Bog…
Can someberry explain what is going on?
The Beast from Berry Bog was a Berryville myth.
I think we had it in Niblet's Hollow too.
"Beware The Beast of Berry Bog, Who comes upon command,
To wander through blue mist and fog,
To spread fear throughout the land!
When elderberries crushed you spy,
Be careful where you tread,
The Beast of Berry Bog is nigh,
And you should get to bed!"
Sorry.
I'll allow it.
If the beast is haunting the fun fair,
berries might be in danger!
Do you think Uncle Crusty will need to shut down?
We're not letting that happen.
We promised to make sure your fun fair was perfect,
and that's exactly what we're gonna do! Right, Shortcakes?
When I said nothing was gonna stop us, not even a marauding monster,
I didn't think there would actually be a marauding monster!
But I don't want my friends to think I'm a scaredyberry, so…
I can't wait to get back out there and face that, uh…
big, monstrous, glowing-eyed beast.
We can take care of that thing no problem.
I don't know what we're worried about, 'cause it's so not a big deal at all!
Actually, it's a very big deal.
If word gets out that a beast from Berry Bog
is haunting the Fright Fall Fun Fair, it could cause a city-wide panic!
So the most important thing right now is that we don't tell anyberry else
So the most important thing right now is that we don't tell anyberry else until we have more information.
Got it?
Uh… Lime?
Aw, fiddle-faddle.
Breaking news from The Fright Fall Fun Fair!
The Beast of Berry Bog is loose!
What is the beast?
Why doesn't the fair want you to know about it?
Are you in danger?
I'm streaming live until I get the truth.
Love you, mean it, Spice Squad! M'wah!
So much for keeping it quiet.
Everyberry in the city is watching. [clip playing] The Beast of Berry Bog is loose!
[clip playing] The Beast of Berry Bog is loose!
[sighing] Good…
If they stay away from the fair, we don't have to worry about facing the beast.
Even though we totally want to save the fair,
and aren't even worried about stopping the beast, right?
What were we talking about again?
So there's regular Shortcakes…
then there's Shortcakes after eating an entire espresso coffee cheesecake by herself,
after eating an entire espresso coffee cheesecake by herself,
and then there's this Shortcakes.
Something's up.
Okay, deep breaths.
Just keep it together, Strawberry. Keep it together.
Noberry will know that you're totally terrified if you just keep… it… together!
Welcome, brand-new followers
to the source for all creature conspiracies!
Purple pies! Perfect for peak performance,
Purple pies! Perfect for peak performance, when running from mysterious monsters!
Johnnycake Cobbler's Monster-B-Gone!
No beast will harm you when you've got this on!
Might be better to shut this whole thing down.
Monsters at the fair… [groaning]
Why would a monster attack a fair?
[snaps fingers] How did that Berry Bog legend start again?
"Beware The Beast of Berry Bog, Who comes upon command…"
"Upon command"!
Someberry summoned it,
and that means suspects!
Seriously, how do you keep doing all that so fast?
Each of these berries has a clear motive to summon the beast--
The Peculiar Purple Pieman.
When he wasn't allowed in the fair,
he was as nasty as his artificial pie filling.
Did he bake up this monstrous scheme?
Pumpkin Spice called the fair "dull."
Perhaps she thought a beast would spice up her feed.
Johnnycake Cobbler.
When the beast showed up to play,
he conveniently had Monster-B-Gone the next day.
Coincidence? I say… no way!
And Crusty Muffin.
Uncle Crusty?
Sorry, Candy,
but he doesn't even seem to like the fair, or berries in general.
Maybe he's looking for an excuse to end it.
One of these berries definitely summoned the beast.
They're behind the attacks.
And if we find out who, we can stop the beast before we have to see it.
Uh, which would be a shame,
because I definitely want to see that thing again.
When we do see it,
I'm working on a new and improved Monster Grabber 4000,
guaranteed to catch the beast!
Let me guess. You can fix that.
What about Huck?
I think he might be a… [whispering loudly] lost cause.
I heard that.
I wanted you to.
I'll be fine! If I close my eyes,
I'll be fine! If I close my eyes, curl up in a ball, and hide in the corner.
I should be able to block out the seemingly endless number of horrors
from which there seems to be no escape.
I know how to get Huck into the Fright Fall spirit.
Normally, I wouldn't care, but this time of year brings out my softer side.
[Sour Grapes] Welcome to Fright Fall 102,
the next level in your Fright Fall education.
Costumes are not the best thing about Fright Fall.
Uh, have you seen me in this costume?
I'm never taking it off!
The best part of Fright Fall is the tricks.
I'm going to dip your hands in these bowls.
You'll feel something gross and scary, but that's the trick.
It's not what you think it is. [nervously] Okay.
[Grapes] These are eyeballs.
-[gasps] -Don't freak. They're peeled grapes.
[shuddering] Gross…
[Grapes] And these are maggots.
[laughs] A-ha! Noodles!
Ha! Let me try one.
That bowl was empty.
But the vast emptiness is terrifying and soul-chilling.
Too real. This got too real! [sobs]
Hope their investigation is going better than this.
[Lime Chiffon] This case was gonna be tougher to crack than a carton of eggs.
The Pieman didn't appreciate the accusation.
He swears he wasn't anywhere near the park,
and if anyberry thought they saw him,
well, he's just got one of those faces.
Pumpkin Spice was in the park…
…but she had a very dramatic list of reasons it wasn't her…
…that she shared with all her followers.
They say "follow the money…"
Johnnycake Cobbler was definitely making money…
…but he was so busy making dough, he said we had to go.
Dead ends. No answers.
We were getting more frustrated than Crusty Muffin…
Who was still really crusty.
Who was still really crusty. The beast's trail was as cold as an ice-cream sandwich,
and nothing was gonna melt it.
Ugh, it could be anyberry!
At this rate, we'll never figure it out!
You tried your best,
but there's no way anyberry's coming back to the fair
with a beast on the loose,
and if I'm being honest, I don't think they should.
If you're ever in Niblet's Hollow, drop me a line.
It was real nice meeting y'all.
On one hand, I feel horrible.
We promised Candy we would help her have the best fun fair ever,
but on the other hand,
now I won't have to face The Beast of Berry Bog.
I feel so awful.
If only we could find the beast!
But we did our best,
and if Candy really wants to leave, we should respect her decision.
There's nothing else we can do.
[Lemon Meringue] Oh, we can find it!
The new and improved Monster Grabber 4000!
-This thing is built to take down a beast! -[clanking]
[groans] Ugh! Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in!
Okay, one, that's awesome.
Two, we still don't know how to find the beast.
Ho-ho, yeah, we do.
It comes complete with forensic scanners
that can isolate the molecular compound unique to the beast,
and follow any traces left in the atmosphere!
The machine can follow the elderberry junk it leaves behind.
Oh! -Gotcha. -Now I get it.
[Lemon] Oh, I've got a trail.
Follow me!
-[shudders in fear] -You okay?
Totally!
I'm just so excited to face this horrifying creature!
I can't do this!
I can't face The Beast of Berry Bog!
I'm sorry. I'm… scared.
Like, really, really scared.

Oh, you berries are the best.
Now, follow me! Let's find that beast!
[shudders] Aah! Follow Lemon. Let's follow Lemon.
[mumbles] I'm not scared. No reason to be scared. I'm not scared. I've never been so scared.
[sighs] We give up.
We tried everything.
Everything? Seriously.
We tried, like, two things.
What more could there possibly be?
Should we sing him a song about facing his fears or something?
Watch and learn.
Everyberry has been treating you like a little sprout this whole time,
but do you know why we have an entire holiday filled with scary things?
It's 'cause the world will always have scary things in it,
and you can either hide from it or deal with it.
That's what Fright Fall is all about…
facing your fears, even when you're afraid.
You're welcome.
Totally what I was gonna say next.
[Lemon] That's as far as the trail goes.
The beast must be in that pond?
So what exactly do we do now?
Go in after it?
-Lure it out? -With what?
A really good poem!
Who doesn't appreciate poetry?
Uh, that's weird.
The trail picks up on the other side of the pond.
It heads down into the Funnel Cake Station.
Aw, fiddle-faddle.
What is it?
I didn't really build the Monster Grabber 4000 to walk down stairs.
to walk down stairs.
Why not?
How many monsters do you know that use mass transit?
So we're gonna grab a monster without our monster-grabber?
We'll be okay. We can do this.
We've got each other!
What? We sang a whole song about it right over there.
I'm learning to grow as a berry!
But also, like, please hold my hand.
Aw! It's sleeping.
I guess terrorizing berries can really take it out of ya.
What is it doing down here?
Maybe it just prefers dark solitary places?
I mean, same.
What is it, Custard?
Oh, biscuits.
Maybe it just needs a hug?
[Huck] Hey, Raspberry?
I just wanted to say thanks.
What you said made a lot of sense.
I know.
Next time I see something scary, whatever it is, I'm gonna face it.
Save yourselves!
Run! It's here!
Don't ask it for a hug!
Get away from them, you beast!
Get everyberry to safety!
-[piece clattering] -[Strawberry] A button?
Someberry distract the beast!
This is my moment!
Angry Eyebrows Huck is here.
Angry but facing the fear!
-Gotta say, it feels okay-- -[boink]
I didn't realize how much the costume informed the attitude.
Shortcakes, you did it!
I did?
I faced my fears!
I beat the beast!
Whoa, adrenaline rush!
I can feel my heart pounding behind my eyeballs!
Uh, I don't think monsters make noises like that.
Let's see what's really going on.
[all] Candy Corn?
You couldn't leave well enough alone, could you?
You just had to solve the mystery, didn't you?
Candy Corn?
You built the beast?
That's totally-- [Lemon] Amazing.
I was gonna say "horrible."
Oh, right, yeah, horrible.
Obviously.
But, like, in a very impressive way.
But why? It doesn't make sense.
Yeah, you're so sweet.
No… I'm… not!
I love monsters and scary movies,
and things that are gross and creepy and sticky and icky,
but noberry wants to hear that from little adorable Candy Corn!
You try being scary with a face like this!
Oh, get over it already!
I knew as long as this fun fair was running,
I'd have to play the cute little mascot.
So I built the Beast of Berry Bog monster to scare everyberry away.
Then Uncle Crusty would have to shut down the carnival,
and I would've gotten away with it, too,
if it hadn't have been for you bumbling berries!
Why didn't you just tell your uncle you didn't like being the mascot?
Uncle Crusty loves it when I play Corny.
What would he think of me if I told him I hated it?
You were afraid.
No!
Yeah.
Sometimes admitting you're afraid is the scariest thing you can do,
but having someberry by your side helps. Come on.
We'll tell your Uncle together.
Really? After everything I did?
Told ya country berries had to stick together.
You were that afraid to tell me?
In her defense, you can be a little intimidating.
Yup, there it is.
I love this fair, but not nearly as much as I love my favorite niece.
You can always tell me anything.
Won't me make me love you any less.
Mystery of the mechanical monster, solved!
Things are always less scary once you've uncovered what's really going on.
That's all very touching, but does this mean no more fair?
Because it was gonna be very good for business.
I think I have an idea.
Step right up, if you dare,
to see our latest and greatest attraction,
The Beast From Berry Bog!
Ta-da!
Berries are loving the new Beast of Berry Bog attraction!
Because let's face it, a little scary can be a lot of fun.
A lot of scary…
can be really scary.
That's why it's good to have best friends by your side,
who will always be there to hold your hand.
So?
What is the Beast Hunter of Berryville up to today?
I think my beast-hunting days are behind me,
but our adventure did inspire my newest recipe.
Ta-da! The Berry Bog Blondie!
Oh, careful, Huck. You might find this treat a little bit-- A-bup-bup-bup-bup!
I too have faced my fears, Strawberry. I'm a changed berry.
your life flashes before your eyes.
Close your eyes.
[woman] A jukebox of special moments…
Bring your awareness to your breath.
…collected together to remind you of all the incredible things…
Breathe.
…that life can offer.
[woman] The good, the bad,
and everything in between.
[woman] If you could control that flashback
and live in the moment again…
would you change things?
[woman 2] Jess?
Something is up. You know I can always tell with you.
Come on.
Tell me.
Okay.
I keep… seeing something.
What… what do you mean "seeing something?"
Well, it's… [exhaling]
It's always vague and in my periphery.
Do you remember Dr. Bones?
He was this thing when we were growing up. This… this, like, vulture skull creature, and--
This… this, like, vulture skull creature, and--
You're fucking with me.
No. You're right. You're right. It sounds mad.
Well, saying it out loud, it does sound a bit crazy.
Dr. Bones.
-Yeah, Dr. Bones. -[discordant music playing]
Uh, tell me again why we have, uh, Vulture Man in here every night.
[sighing] He's called Dr. Bones,
and he makes me feel safe.
I thought that was my job.
Well, every hero needs a sidekick.
-I'm the sidekick? -Uh-huh. [chuckling]
Right.
-Fine. -He's on yo… [clearing throat]
-Come on! -Okay.
[both] ♪ He's on your street, and he's in your home, sound the alarm ♪
[exclaiming] ♪ It's Dr. Bones ♪
[in funny voice] Time to wake up!
Get off. God, you're such a kid.
Fine. The doll can stay.
Yes!
-And you know that tatty old thing with… -[gasping] Rude.
Well, it would actually look much nicer in a… in a nursery
Well, it would actually look much nicer in a… in a nursery surrounded by some other slightly less terrifying toys,
don't you think?
Yeah?
You know I'm ready.
For real?
Scott…
I love you more than chips.
-That's a lot. -That is a lot.
[Jess] And if it finally gets you to decorate that spare room,
then I'm in.
Oh, I…
-I have to ask you something, actually. -[Jess] Mm-hmm.
What was that?
What?
I heard something.
-Go check it out. -Why me?
If you wanna be Dr. Bones' sidekick, you're gonna have to prove yourself.
Go.
All right, look, if I'm not back in five minutes,
avenge my death.
[Jess] Always. Now, go.
Get out.
Scott?
Scott?
-I didn't mean it. He just came at me. -Scott?
Scott!
No!
Dude, I'm so sorry.
[Jess panting] Oh my God.
Where am I?
Am I dead?
I'm dead.
[Jess] Come on, Jess.
You can do this.
Practice what you preach.
Control your breathing.
Slow it down.
Control your breath.
You're doing it.
Slow your breath down.
Breathe.
Jess.
Breathe.
Oh my God.
I'm thirteen.
[Jess] It worked.
I need to find Scott. Warn him.
Dad!
Jess, you having a good birthday, love? Go follow your friends.
No. Dad, I've been shot!
You haven't started. How've you been shot already?
Someone broke into the apartment. Scott is dead! And they shot me!
[man] What? That Scott?
Scott? [panting]
[Jess] Scott!
Hey, Jess, I…
Gross. Jess, what are you doing?
I… I just saw you dead!
What?
You have to stay away from me!
But you invited me.
In twelve years' time, we work together at a local gym.
You as a PT and me as a yoga instructor.
It's my 25th birthday and all my friends forget
so you take me to the worst Italian place in the city,
and we eat spaghetti bolognese like Lady and the Tramp.
-What are you talking about, Jess? -I get wine drunk.
Slip and hurt my ankle. You offer to drive me home, and I accept.
You carry me all the way to my door, and it's the third-floor apartment.
You're so tired you end up passed out on my sofa
watching The Office on Netflix.
The DVD company?
[Jess] Sort… sort of.
[sighing] You'll find out.
In the morning, we have breakfast,
and you tell me you've liked me since we were 13.
Since my thirteenth birthday.
That's today.
Yes, that's today.
So you'll have to promise me you'll do what I say.
[woman] Battle commences in T-minus one minute.
Jess, you're being… weird.
I've got to go.
[woman] Five, four, three, two, one.
Let the battle commence.
Scott!
Got you, Jess!
[Jess] I really need you to understand.
Maybe if we never get together, things will change.
You'd be alive!
Scott!
[computer] Incoming fire.
Oh my God, Scott.
-What the hell, Jess? -[Jess] No!
No, not yet!
[Scott] Come on!
[laughing] Jess, I didn't know there would be a Dr. Bones here as well.
Did your dad hire him? [chuckling]
[Jess] Scott,
I need you to promise you'll never talk to me again.
We can't get into a relationship. If we do, we both die.
-You've got to believe me. -Okay.
-I believe you. I won't talk to you again. -Please.
It's okay. It's okay, it's time.
I love you more than chips.
And if I'm not back in five minutes,
avenge my death.
[Jess] This has to work.
Okay.
Control your breath, Jess.
Breathe.
Breathe.
And breathe out.
Give gratitude to your mind,
your body,
and your breath,
for allowing you to practice today.
[all] Thank you.
You're welcome.
[Jess] What if you could change the past?
[Jess] Avoid what went wrong the first time around?
What if you're presented with an opportunity
to take another path?
Would you take it?
Even if it leads to someone else's happy ending?
[Jess] Well…
I've got all the time in the world to find mine.
♪ Dr. Bones ♪
♪ He's on your street And he's in your home ♪
But this is my story, and I did it for the right reasons.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. [chuckles] Listen.
I'm not gonna soft-pedal what we did. And by "we"…
You know, I'm not gonna name names, except for Liza Drake.
[Pete] Are you talking to her?
Okay. Well, what you need to remember is that, you know,
we're not Purdue Pharma.
We didn't kill America.
This is 2011, and strictly speaking, we weren't even part of the opioid crisis.
You know, Lonafen was never a street drug.
But, you know, people hear "fentanyl"
and, you know, they lose all fucking perspective.
"Ooh, you sold fentanyl?"
Like, I'm El Chapo or something.
You wanna know who did fentanyl?
Your mother. And let me tell you, it saved my bacon
when Liza, like, blew out my pelvis with her giant baby head.
Liza Drake?
Well, she invented me.
On the one hand, there were times I wanted her to die in a plane crash,
and other times where I wished she would die
in a slower, more painful way.
Look, the thing about Liza is, she didn't give a fuck…
about anybody.
And in that way she was like family to me.
[Liza] What do you want, Randy?
-[Randy] I wouldn't antagonize me, Liza. -Why not?
I'm trying to keep this amicable for the sake of my daughter.
"My daughter."
Love how you say that. Really makes it sound like you showed up. Ever.
-What are you talking about? -What the fuck?
Bring Phoebe back to Savannah yesterday, and I'll give you every third weekend.
[Liza] Why? Phoebe doesn't want that. You don't even want it.
Up here she's got a beautiful home on a half-acre lot with beach access,
and you got… a car.
-Take me out of it. -Ugh.
Are you at a bar?
Not really.
-Liza! -I gotta go, Randy.
Liza…
All right. Wait, wait, wait.
So where are we?
-God damn it, Pete. -One script.
-Hundred mics. -My fault.
-Hundred mics! -Shouldn't have picked up the phone. It's one fucking script, what's the big deal, Jimmy?
It's one fucking script, what's the big deal, Jimmy? -A hundred mics! -I know it. Take it light, now.
-Jimmy! -Come on, man.
-[Pete] You gonna call me tomorrow? -[Jimmy] Not likely.
-Fuck! -Hi, there.
I'll save you the trouble. I'm not in the mood for a lap dance.
Me neither, I just had to get off that stage.
-Still not gonna pay for a lap dance. -Still not selling you one, dude.
Wanna play a game?
Wanna play a game with me? Just one game. Bet you ten bucks I can peg you.
Well, you can try, but… fair warning. I wrestled in high school.
Okay, so…
if you're in this shithole, you're not finance.
I'd say insurance, except your Ferragamos are too nice.
So I'm guessing cars.
Or you're a drug rep.
[Pete] She had a gift for reading people.
She can make you feel very seen and understood
in this very powerful way,
and then 45 minutes later, you're out two grand.
All of a sudden, before I can start pounding him,
he does this, like, whole thing.
This whole move.
And he's got his head in between my little 13-year-old thighs,
and he starts going, like, fucking…
Like fucking Pac-Man.
And I realize this mild-mannered deacon is trying to,
how shall I say,
bite my fucking dick off.
Your dad tried to bite your dick off?
Oh, it wasn't like that. It was like a fucking… foster guy.
That is… awful.
It's a terrible story.
Well, [sighs] there's a happy ending.
Knocked couple teeth down his throat before he got the goods.
[Liza] Yeah?
Sir!
Listen.
I'm sure some asshole says this every shift,
but I can take you out of here.
Take yourself home in one piece, we'll be good. Okay?
-Destiny! Phone call. -Gotta go.
-Gotta go. -Listen, listen, listen. I like you. Okay?
Come work for me.
I'll put 100k in your pocket this year.
-Really? -Yeah.
[man] Hey, phone call!
If I'm lying, you can kiss me anywhere you want on this perfect body.
Destiny, phone call!
-Oh my God, what happened? -Mom, I'm so sorry.
It's okay, baby.
-No, I'm sorry. -What happened?
It was stupid, and now they're gonna kick us out.
No one's kicking you out.
We're good. Oh my gosh, what happened?
I'm sorry, Miss Drake, but if this isn't an expulsion-worthy offense,
I don't know what is.
What's the offense, exactly?
[scoffs] Take your pick.
Bringing illegal fireworks into the school.
[Liza] Okay. Sorry. Just to clarify,
those weren't technically fireworks or illegal.
I bought 'em at Circle K.
[principal] It's not the point.
Your daughter endangered the safety of every student in school.
[Phoebe] Shoot, okay.
Can I push back?
I feel no other kids were in danger. They were across the street.
They weren't on property. Let's take it from there. Leaving school without permission.
Let's take it from there. Leaving school without permission.
[Liza] Yep. Sure did. And I looked it up in the discipline code,
and you could let that go with a warning if you wanted to.
[principal] Or five-day suspension.
Oh my gosh.
Do you wanna do one day?
Which, I think, still seems harsh, but I'm good to close there.
[Liza] Sorry about that.
It's all right, girls. Keep your heads up.
-Three days? -I know. She was gonna kick 'em out.
-It's a good result, you know? -It's a fucking nightmare.
-Who's gonna watch them? -I mean, don't look at me.
No one is looking at you, Jeff.
Dude, as a matter of fact, could you please…
Lis, it's fine. It's gonna be fine. Okay?
They canned me for walking off my shift, so I'm gonna be around.
-Wow. That was fast, even for you. -You insult me and fucking belittle me…
Can I just point out you said one week? It's been two months.
I'm so sorry for the wear and tear on your garage couch. All right?
And I won't even mention the money.
You just did, so. You'll get your cash.
-All right? You'll get it. -Wonderful. Great!
-How? -Soon!
[Jackie] It just so happens, Andy,
that your sister and I are about to do very well for ourselves.
Oh, cool. Cool. Um…
Webcamming? Or identity theft?
Liza has invented something to market my skincare products that is so cool.
-So smart. So creative. -Please don't, no.
Oh, I will because it's amazing.
It's an app.
And it'll have a gizmo thing
where you take a picture of your face and you upload it.
Analyzes your skin type,
and it curates a regimen of Mom's products. It's pretty cool.
-You must have spent hours on that. -[Liza] I did, actually.
And the tech is so much bigger than cosmetics.
It's like interior design, it's telemedicine.
[Andy] Wait, you're a tech genius now?
Liza, your life is on fire.
Go fuck yourself, Andy! You know what? Get the fuck out of my house!
You know what? Get the fuck out of my house!
-Fine! -[Andy] I'm done! I'm just done!
-She doesn't mean it. -[Liza] She does.
-No-- -[Andy] Pack your shit, Mom. You're next.
[Liza] Oh God.
Hi.
[woman] Hi.
Come on, babe, it's okay.
…probably would've put us in jail.
-But then my mom-- -[Liza] Hey! Phoebe…
That's my mom. She Jedi mind-tricked her.
-So it's just suspension. -Wow.
Bedtime, sweetie. Let's go.
Yeah, this is Sidney.
Uh, he works on boats.
-He fell off a boat and broke his arm. -Okay.
Yeah, among other achievements.
Hi, I'm Camille.
-Y'all moving in? -Yeah. Yeah. Just down there.
[Camille] Okay. Uh, you know what?
I have something for you.
[Liza] Oh, hi.
We met the notorious Phoebe who torched the school, so.
[Liza] Well, just the woods.
Well, they gotta burn down every now and then.
-Cycle of life, right? -[Sidney] Yeah.
Welcome to D-Block. -[Phoebe] Oh. -[Liza] Thank you.
Oh, is it… Is it noisy around here?
-[Camille] A little bit. -Okay.
-Nice. -No, it's okay.
Yeah, I got a blanket. Thanks, though.
It's a quilt.
[Liza] We can't take your quilt, thank you.
Take it.
She's kind of on this Robin Hood kick right now,
and she thinks we're the rich.
Okay. Sure.
-Sure. Take it. Thank you. -Okay, yeah.
-Thanks. -Thank you.
-Hey, thanks for these. -Yeah, thank you.
-[Liza] Say thanks. -[Phoebe] Thank you.
-Nice to meet you. -Knock if you need anything.
-Anything for a juice, this one. -[all chuckling]
Bye. Ow!
-All right, baby. -Thank you.
Shove it right in there!
-You feel good? -Yeah. You?
-Yeah. -All right.
[Liza] You want some movie salad?
[softly] Okay.
[softly] Pass the remote.
[softly] I will not give up on myself.
I will not give up on my dreams.
I will make my life count.
[Liza] Hi, Mr. Brenner.
This is Liza Drake.
Uh, it was my pleasure to make your acquaintance, uh, yesterday.
Hope you're feeling all right. Um…
I'm calling about the employment offer that, that, that you offered yesterday.
Um, so if you want to call me back at this number,
that would be awesome, be wonderful. I hope you have a really wonderful day.
And…
Okay, bye-bye.
-[sighs] Momma. -[Jackie chuckles]
Oh, you're gonna get through this. Yes.
Yes, you will.
It's who you are.
[Pete] Look, it's not about money.
I mean, it is, because you're gonna be backing the biggest IPO of the year.
So what's it about?
It's about after you retire and look back,
you'd be able to say, "I wasn't just… a banker."
"I was a hero."
If it's such a terrific medication, why is your market penetration under 1%?
Because we don't have the money to compete.
This is Praxiom.
They own the breakthrough pain sector with a fentanyl lollipop
that is so toxic and ineffective, it's our moral duty to horsefuck 'em.
This shit rots your teeth and takes 45 minutes to kick in.
Lonafen takes five.
We come on like the Navy SEALS.
And when your bones are on fire from cancer pain, those five minutes are a godsend.
But your Binaca blaster thing, it's fentanyl, isn't it?
The stuff that killed Ohio?
No. The Hartigan study out of Mass General
puts the risk of addiction and overdose at less than 1%.
$35 million, that's Zanna's current debt level?
[Pete] Actually, $80 million down was current.
All from the pocket of this guy,
Dr. Jack Neel, pharma's fuzziest billionaire.
If you consider a market penetration forecast
post IPO of 22, maybe even 26%--
[Pete] Soon to be bankrupt thanks to this fine-tuned hard pass factory,
our CEO, Eric Paley.
We'll say a market floor of $1 billion.
As you'll note in our SEC disclosure, our efforts to educate prescribers
face challenges in the areas of, uh, capitalization--
[Pete] Brent Larkin, VP of marketing,
a backstabbing snake hired for his bionic ability
to make you wanna buy the opposite of whatever he was selling.
We spent the last year fighting for a promotion to COO.
The marketing spend of $10 million
could achieve an adequate level of acceptance
from physicians, patients, third-party payers
to make Lonafen profitable.
[man] Listen, I'm sorry.
It doesn't matter if that thing squirts liquid Jesus.
Nobody's prescribing it.
At this point, Doctor, the way that you get whole
is to sell that patent to someone with a war chest to break into market.
Sorry.
[woman] Right?
Who's that?
She's a sales lady from J&J. Excuse me.
Wha-- Uh, are we not under a hiring freeze?
Mr. Brenner, Liza Drake.
Hi, listen, I'm sorry just to show up.
-I did try calling-- -The address isn't on the card.
I called the secretary of state, and they pulled the corporate files.
I thought about it. I'd like to take you up on your offer.
You got a résumé?
-Yeah! -Come on.
-Only two years of high school? -Well, I left to pursue a career in sales.
-Cutco? Steak knives door to door? -Yeah!
-It was other kinds of knives too. -Mm-hmm.
-Amway, Avon, Mary Kay. -Mm-hmm.
President of Green Rock Enterprises. What's that? Uh, the model was to upcycle biocharred hog waste
Uh, the model was to upcycle biocharred hog waste
into a sustainable drywall product.
It was pretty cool.
-You made sheetrock out of dried pig shit? -Almost. Yeah.
You own a restaurant in Savannah? How'd that pan out?
It's doing good.
It's doing solid numbers for my ex.
[quietly] Come on, Mr. Brenner, give me a shot.
Give me a shot, please.
[quietly] Come on. Give me a shot.
-You got a Word file of this? -Yeah.
Here you go.
Bio-- cum laude biochem-- Well, you-- I don't--
PhD. Come on. I barely got my GED.
-Come on. -God.
-Hey, Pete, can we talk? -Come on.
-Excuse me. -Dr. Neel!
-Sorry. I'd like you to meet Liza Drake. -Hi!
Hi.
I just read your Pharma Quarterly piece. It was, um…
I'm such a fan!
Very nice of you to say.
Nice to meet you.
All right.
-The pleasure is mine. -Of course. Yes.
Well…
Is that your wife? Wow.
Beautiful smile.
[Jack] Yes. Thank you.
I suppose you know the story?
-I would love to hear it from you. -Well…
-Forty years we were married… -Wow.
…and Zanna was a breath of life for me.
She truly was.
Yeah.
But then she was diagnosed with liver cancer,
and although I could accept that she would die…
the fact that she was gonna die not only in pain,
but in fear of pain,
that I could not accept.
So that's why I developed Lonafen,
so I can give other cancer patients
the kind of help that I could not give my own wife.
Right.
Full disclosure, you're gonna be joining a doomed endeavor.
-Oh! -Yeah. No regrets.
If we must sink the ship, as it appears,
all we got to do is aim it to an iceberg that we believe in.
In any case, I… couldn't be in the hands of a better skipper than Captain Pete.
Thank you, sir.
[Jack] You're welcome.
Well… I mean, here's my résumé, if you want it.
-We don't need that. -[Liza chuckles]
-Awesome. Okay. -All right.
So I'm in?
-You're in. -I'll see you around.
Okay, boss.
-You're gonna do just fine. -Thank you.
-Good work, Pete. -Thank you, sir.
-You didn't mention the iceberg. -He talks a little dramatic.
-Just a soft quarter. -You were bullshitting.
-What do you think? I'm in sales. -This wonder drug is morphine?
-Souped-up aspirin? -Hold on.
-Hey, Brent. -Hi. I'm Liza Drake.
Uh, Pete shoulda told ya, we're under a hiring freeze.
Go tell Dr. Neel. She's his hire.
Pay is $7.60.
You cover your own travel.
You got one week.
One week to what?
Invent a doctor.
Invent a doctor. What does that mean?
Get a doctor to prescribe your drug. Just one script.
And if I don't?
-Then you're fired. -Great, so zero job security.
-Then you're fired. -Great, so zero job security. the base pay's half what I make temping--
Base pay is for shit birds.
Commissions get you into paradise. Know what we bill on a full-dose script?
-What? -40 grand.
-A year? -A month.
I can commission 48 grand a year on one patient?
Or half a mil on ten.
Is that real?
It's up to you. You eat what you kill.
It's a long-odds lottery ticket buried under a thousand rejections,
and you gotta have the grit and the balls to reach down and scratch it.
I get it.
It's your weekend. Don't embarrass me.
[woman] Lonafen is a revolutionary medication
for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain.
A two-year independent clinical trial out of Massachusetts General Hospital
conducted by Dr. Elliot Hartigan
found that the risks for both overdose and dependency
for patients using Lonafen were less than 1%.
Lonafen is the world's first sublingual fentanyl spray.
It is applied under the tongue
where the sublingual artery absorbs the medication
into the bloodstream in just five minutes.
That's the fastest relief a patient can get without a needle.
-What are you doing? -When patients experience spiking pain…
Uh, it's a drug rep chatroom.
"What are some tips and tricks for starting out in pharma sales?"
Okay.
-"Dear noob, a low-cut blouse…" -No.
-"…and a push-up bra…" -No!
"…has been the standard for the last 20 years."
-No! Stop! Stop it! -No, no, no, no!
You need to hear this. Okay? Um…
Oh my gosh.
"Go to the hospital's drug closet,
get naked and wait on your knees for the doctor…"
This is crazy. You are a child.
I don't want you reading this!
No!
Stop.
Isn't it funny?
"Gross doctor I'm selling to flirting with me…" Okay, we're done.
Thanks. Leave it to Mom. We're good.
[chuckling] No, give it…
Not for your eyes. Not for your eyes.
Don't do that again.
Sorry.
Let me focus, okay?
Okay.
Pop the trunk.
What's in the box?
What's that smell?
No, it's spinach lasagna and apple slump.
-I mean, the video's just lunch and learn. -This is Pete.
-Hi. -Shouldn't you be in school?
-No. I'm kicked out. -Suspended.
-What for? -Arson.
It was not.
-That's pretty cool. -Where to?
[Pete] Lakeland Pain Clinic.
Lair of the one Dr. Nathan Lydell, $9 million man.
That's how much he wrote for the competition last year.
Oh, wow. Sketch-a-rama, jeez.
That, my friends, is the $9 million man.
Guys, here's the deal. It's safer than aspirin.
And because it works faster, you can reduce other pain meds.
So they're not so zonked out all the time.
So they can be here, be present, right? "It's a gift."
"It's a blessing." That's what we're hearing.
From patients and their families. How about it, Doctor?
Incredible.
Well, if you got some patients in mind, we can leave some coupons. Circle back--
No, this stuff. What's it called?
Apple slump.
Knock-knock.
[Dr. Lydell] Hey, she's alive.
Did you not get my call?
Oh, Nate. I am so sorry.
We were on a work retreat to Turks and Caicos,
but next time, you are coming with me.
Come on, I have so much to tell you about.
Let's go to your office.
I thought the pitch went well.
-Doesn't matter. Praxiom owns him. -Why? 'Cause she got macaroons?
-Doesn't matter. Praxiom owns him. -Why? 'Cause she got macaroons? [mouths] Fuck you.
Because she reminds him of a girl he used to jerk off to in high school,
except now he holds the cards.
Your grande double Snickers latte. I'd like to talk about Lonafen again.
It is the fastest-acting breakthrough pain medication.
-It is five minutes, the onset-- -I will get back to you.
45 minutes faster than Xeraphen. Dr. Bowen, you're missing out!
Dr. Chen's all booked today.
Could you please just show her the clinical trial, please? Please.
Or I can just leave her with some of these.
I mean, we have so much fun stuff here. I love these pens. They're so hilarious.
-Where are you from? -Zanna Therapeutics.
Want some for your kids?
No, I mean, don't you know the industry banned this stuff years ago?
Dr. Lanning, I was wondering, sir, if I could pitch you--
[woman] Good morning, Doctor. Oh, he'll be just a moment.
-Okay. -Thank you so much for waiting.
All right.
It's okay. You tried.
She's horrible.
Yeah.
Pheeb?
Pheeb, are you good?
-Yeah, why? -You were staring.
What's up, girl? Hey.
Hi.
Sorry. So…
Oh my God.
It's all right. She's okay.
It's okay. She just needs some space. She's fine.
[nurse] Is there anything I can get you?
It's okay. She's just having a seizure. She's fine. She's okay.
It's okay, honey. Look at Mom.
Look at Momma. It's okay, baby.
I got you. I got you. I got you.
It's okay, baby. It's okay.
So, Phoebe, you got something going on?
Yeah, I got epilepsy going on.
Well, epilepsy is a general diagnosis
for "Phoebe's gets seizures, but we don't really know why."
I know why. This guy.
-That's a tumor. -It's not a tumor. It's not cancer.
Uh, we call it AVM, arteriovenous malformation.
It's a little tangle of blood vessels,
and when the blood backs up, it swells, and you get a seizure.
So, what do we do?
Well, I'm hoping nothing.
This thing's small and looks stable,
and sometimes childhood AVMs get straightened out during puberty.
Ugh, gross.
Um, what if it doesn't?
We'll probably need to get him out.
Option A, which is a fine option, a full craniotomy.
[Liza] I.e., cut open Phoebe's skull
and scoop out the not-a-tumor with a melon baller.
Or option B…
…is a keyhole procedure, where we go in through the nose.
Lower risk, minimally invasive, we don't have to retract the brain…
[Liza] The only hitch, the non-melon baller option
[Liza] The only hitch, the non-melon baller option wasn't covered by Medicaid.
And they don't cover the keyhole option,
the radiation, or the post-op therapy.
But for now,
unless there's another seizure,
dizziness, headaches, I don't need to see you for six months.
Meantime, Phoebe,
I want you getting plenty of rest, staying on top of your meds,
and Mom, do what we can to keep things calm and stable at home.
It's not forever. It's two months max.
-I'll get a decent job, an apartment. -Two months?
It's gonna be awesome. It's gonna be great.
-[mimics ape noises] -What are you doing?
Sorry, I thought we were making meaningless noises.
I'm trying to do what's best for you--
Best for me? So you want me to live with evil people.
Your dad's not evil. Come on.
-Yeah, well, Diana is. -She's fine.
No, she's not fine, Mom.
You know what? She says evil stuff about you.
Yeah? What'd she say?
-She-- -What does she say? Say it.
Say it.
She says that you're…
you're a loser and a… leech, and that you don't know how to be a mom.
What an asshole.
-God. Hey, Pete. -Hey!
I'm looking at the iPad GPS.
Want to tell me why you're 30 miles outside your territory?
Something came up and, um…
I got through the whole call sheet. Nothing. So…
Thank you for the opportunity. Want me to put the iPad in the mail?
No, no, unacceptable! I paid for five days--
It only took four to get turned down by every whale in the state.
Well, then you get turned down again! Okay?
I own you until five o'clock!
I'm taking Phoebe up to her dad's in Savannah.
Well, luckily, Savannah is not going anywhere!
You are holding the bag until five o'clock, or I will incinerate your fucking life!
I will drag your ass through small claims court. I will…
Hello?
[Phoebe] What are we doing?
[Liza] We're just gonna cool out for 12 minutes. All right?
-Why? -Because, so I don't get sued.
Just chill, baby, please.
Okay? Please.
Okay.
[Phoebe] Oh, hey, it's Dr. Sketchball.
Keep the doors locked.
[Dr. Lydell] No, this is a circular conversation that I'm getting really tired of having.
This is what I keep saying. The prenup is airtight on spousal support.
Where is she getting 40%?
Just… Just… No. Nope.
Lucky lady. My ex took the business.
Hey.
-It's apple slump. -Don't worry.
I'm not gonna pitch you. I came for my Tupperware. That all right?
-Yeah? Okay. -Yeah.
[Kate] Baby. If you don't tell him about the side effects, I will.
[Matt] I don't want to get into it.
It is what it is.
-Hey, Matt, what's new, man? -The mouth sores are new.
-[Dr. Lydell] It's okay. -Nothing's okay. He can barely talk.
He walks around like a zombie all the time
because he's always sucking on this lollipop
and it never works. He's always in pain.
[Dr. Lydell] Sounds like we should think about stepping down the Xeraphen dosage.
That might be a good idea.
[Matt] Can I just get outta here, please?
-Are you in pain? The mouth sores-- -[Matt] No!
[Dr. Lydell] Hold tight. One sec.
-Excuse me. -Don't get the question.
I accidentally overheard you. Why didn't you help him?
-What's your name again? -Liza Drake.
All the complaints, the mouth sores, the onset time,
is exactly where Lonafen would be better.
I'm not trying to sell you. I'm done with it.
It just makes no fucking sense to me.
Why is nobody willing to prescribe a better drug?
-Why? I don't understand. -Listen…
Liza, the truth is,
you can't just switch patients every time there's a new medication.
-Xeraphen is a known quantity. -Known to be terrible. She just told you.
-I don't know that Lonafen is different. -You won't even give it a shot.
Excuse me…
What are you talking about?
[Dr. Lydell] It's chemically identical to what you're already taking,
but… the onset time is purportedly faster and should help you with your mouth sores.
Yeah, I don't know.
[Matt] I didn't.
All I knew was I was scared, all the time.
And I'm not a frightened person.
I was a Navy corpsman, by the way.
Greenside in Iraq.
I saw some things, got through some sporty situations,
but I was never afraid.
Never had a bad dream.
But when I got sick, bro…
I was in mortal fucking terror.
[Matt] To keep that hurt from sneaking up on you,
you get to where you want to stay juiced up all the time.
[boy] Mom…
can we please get something to eat?
Lobby now.
-But, Mom-- -Lobby… now!
Yeah, okay.
Okay?
We'll have to start you back at 100 micrograms
and see if we need to titrate you up from there.
First couple weeks will be rocky.
[Eric] All right, everyone.
Obviously, we're all looking at the same numbers,
so you probably already know what I'm about to say.
-But the point is-- -No.
Okay, well, to bring down overhead
through this next little stretch…
-Nice power suit. What's up? -Nothing.
I just… got a script.
-Who? -Dr. Lydell in Lakeland.
-Wow. -[Brent] Bullshit.
I did.
-Check it. -[Catherine] Checking it.
-100 mics. Big fucking deal. -That is a big fucking deal.
That's my nine million-dollar man, and Liza got him pregnant.
-Think he's pregnant? -I think he's pretty pregnant.
He told you explicitly he's gonna write more Lonafen?
He said he wanted to join our speaker program, so I said, "Great."
You said we had a speaker program?
No, I said Dr. Lydell's gonna launch our speaker program,
and it's gonna be amazing.
Speaker programs are pharma's dirty little secret,
minus the little and secret.
What's a speaker program? It's where you fly prescribers
to Hawaii, Pebble Beach, and if you're doing it by the book,
you get some asshole to speed read a slide deck
so everyone can get back to hitting on drug reps and getting drunk.
And then they fly home and they write your drug.
It's a legal grift,
and everybody was doing it.
And we would have too.
But we were broke.
Hotels, flights, catering.
-Who's gonna book it? Kathy gonna book it? -It's Catherine.
I don't think it needs to be a fancy boondoggle.
He drives a PT Cruiser, going through divorce, and lonely.
He'd be psyched to hold court at a taco stand.
No fucking way.
[Brent] The issue with this right here is that these floors are warped.
So it's probably gonna take a curve up in here, and then…
[Liza] I have an idea.
What if fuck Brent Larkin?
Love that? How?
We do the event on the cheap, pay for it out of pocket.
Nah…
-Why not? -I don't want my dick on a chopping block.
I mean cheap-cheap.
We kick in, like, 400 bucks apiece.
A ten-point commission on $9 million a year.
Dumbass doesn't get any of it.
-Come on. -I don't know.
What don't you know?
As a wise man once said, it's a lottery ticket.
He's got to have the grit to scratch his balls.
[Brent] Look at that panel. You're gonna hear that nice ding.
-You're gonna hear it ding. -I like you.
Good.
Hey!
Saved you a seat.
Where are the doctors?
Half of them couldn't make it, and the rest are no-shows.
Oh, fuck!
-What about Lydell? -Well…
I was gonna call him and tell him not to come,
but since he's your kill, I'll give you the pleasure.
No. We are holding this event.
Liza, us shitting the bed and rolling around in it is the event.
We got the room, the food!
Yeah, and a sign-in sheet that has to have prescribers' names on it.
Or we get a visit from the Feds.
Hi! Is anyone here a doctor?
I'm a podiatrist.
He's a quack. I'm a podiatrist.
Do you want to have some ribs and wine with me?
I think I do.
Yeah? You too?
Leeza. Hey, Leeza! I thought we were gonna hang out! Come on!
-I'll be right there. -Hey, where you going?
I am so sorry, Liza. There was a wreck on the 4.
No problem. No problem at all.
Did everybody leave?
Dr. Lydell, I understand.
Listen. Hey, how is Matt?
-Who? What? Who's Matt? -Your patient. Is Lonafen working for him?
-What? -How is he?
Come on. Tell me.
I saw him yesterday. [exhales]
He said, "Doc, I oughta fuck you up for not switching me six months ago."
[Matt] No bullshit.
That stuff did just like she said.
Gave me my life back for a minute.
Are you gonna take him off it now?
I won't take advice from someone who threw a speakers' program nobody attended--
It was a shitshow. I understand.
Listen, you deserve a big event. Huge, huge.
-Other doctors need to hear you speak. -Those guys?
Not those guys. They're podiatrists. The industry.
The industry… needs to hear that even though Praxiom think they own you,
like they own everyone else in the state,
you wrote what was right for your patient.
I wrote your drug.
-What else do you want from me? -Come on.
I want to know how to get doctors to write the best drug. How?
And get paid?
Goddamn right. It's how the market should work.
It's rotten right now.
Help me change it.
Come on. Help me change it.
How?
I don't know.
It starts with some cold ribs and some shit-faced podiatrists.
[Dr. Lydell] I said, "I'm not pre-diabetic." -"I just want a colonoscopy." -[all laughing]
[Liza] That was it. Market penetrated.
♪ I know who I want to take me home! ♪
-Yeah! -[whooping]
♪ I know who I want to take me home! ♪
♪ I know who I want to take me home ♪
♪ Take me home ♪
[sighs] And I see the outline of this guy's toes on the windshield.
Put my foot up there.
And it didn't fit.
And so I knew. I knew she was gonna marry the guy. Aw. So sorry, Nate.
Aw. So sorry, Nate.
[Liza] By the way, I did nothing illegal.
Pete took care of that.
We'll scale your fee according to your clinical experience.
My clinical experience?
We can give you $1,500 per speaking engagement,
three per week,
if you switch all your Xeraphen patients to Lonafen.
-[Dr. Lydell] Best friends! -[Liza] Ok!
[Dr. Lydell] ♪ Friends forever! ♪
-You get home safe. -No, you go home.
-[Liza] We'll see you soon! -You go home.
-[Liza] Okay, bye! -Everyone's gonna go home now.
[Liza] What the hell was that?
We just harpooned Free fucking Willy!
$4,500? Is that even legal?
67 in a 65.
Everyone else on the road's doing 80.
We just launched the best cancer pain med the world's ever seen,
so who gives a fuck?
But if they're that good, why do we have to pay him?
If we don't, someone else will.
Big pharma's about finding that gray line, getting close without crossing over.
-What happens if we go over? -You get a speeding ticket. A fine.
It's baked into the marketing budget.
-We don't have a marketing budget! -We will! Jesus Christ, Liza!
You just saved the company!
You're gonna help thousands of cancer patients!
Three weeks ago, you're working at the titty shack,
and now you're a pharma legend!
Be happy!
I'm happy! Yeah, yeah.
It was fun! Told you cheap would work.
-Right? -Get home safe.
Okay, you too.
[Phoebe] Give me the meatball. Come on! Come on. Come on.
Come on. Hey, batta batta!
Come on, Sid!
[Sidney] Laura's up, you got a shot.
-[Phoebe] I'm sorry! -[Camille] Sid!
-Sid, you okay? -Sid?
No! Oh, is the bone sticking out, girls?
Can you see? Can you…
-Sayonara, sucker! [laughs] -Oh!
-[Sidney] Double play! -[Phoebe] Oh!
You are such a jerk, Sidney!
[mouthing] Are you okay?
Fine. Fine.
Hey!
[Phoebe] Hey! Whoa!
Dude!
What the fuck?
Look. Fucker's writing Lonafen like his hand's on fire.
-Holy shit. -400 mics.
Six hundred. Eight.
Guy switched 40 patients in three days.
Oh my God.
So…
What? Why?
Come on.
-"Rookie of the year." -Think of me when you pawn it.
I'm not gonna pawn it.
Pete, this is really…
-Can you open it? -Yeah. There you go.
This is really…
You're not gonna make 100k this year.
It's gonna be more like 600.
It's weird, right?
You happy?
What's going on? Something wrong?
Well, whatever, a deal's a deal, right?
Gonna let you kiss me anywhere you want.
Although fair warning,
clinical trials have shown a very high addiction rate.
Thank you.
[Jackie] Fuck.
-[banging at door] -Ugh, what?
Hi, Mom, your car crapped out.
[Jackie] Liza. Wow.
It's yours.
-No. -Yes.
No, I can't.
Sell it. Buy a moped. I don't care.
-Take it. -It's quite… Liza!
-Take it! -Oh, my…
-Oh, Liza. My… -You happy?
Oh my God, yes.
That's too… Oh, thank you!
Get your ass in it!
Oh! Thank you! [giggles]
It's so shiny! [chuckles]
With interest.
-Hey, I… -[Jackie] Okay.
How are you making this kind of money?
Well, it's a 10% commission on total net sales. So, that's how…
So you just walk in off the street, and all of a sudden, you're…
Start bringing pain relief to cancer patients in agony.
Is that a problem?
Is that a bummer?
Be happy.
[Brent] You two are fucking voided.
You are roasted on a goddamn spit.
-All right. -Grab your shit and go. Seriously.
-Grouchy Gary. -Meany bear.
I expressly forbade you from hosting a speaker program.
Why do you hate speaker programs?
What I hate are insubordinate shitheels who'd risk the reputation of this company.
This company has no reputation 'cause you never risk shit.
You can't just fucking do this! You need a compliance team
-to vet the speaker… -[Pete] Let's hire one!
…who might be a pill mill operator
-with the DEA up his ass! -Lydell's not running a pill mill.
And you'd know if you ever actually carried the bag.
Fine! Wait for Dr. Jack to throw you out a window
when I tell him what you did.
What we did, Brent, is $200,000 net this week
with one fucking doctor.
Not to distract you from getting us fired.
No, no, no. I mean, obviously, these numbers are encouraging.
I need to think about how to position the program with the boss.
-You mean how to take credit. -We told Jack. He's cool with it.
Okay.
Yeah, we're greenlit to pilot the program in the southeast.
We're staffing up.
Check it out.
Want to tell us a bit about yourself?
Yes! Pre-med at UF, Phi Beta Kappa.
Interned at Merck. I was a Pfizer junior leader there.
-Yes. -No.
Says you got your pharmacy degree from Amherst.
-I didn't know they had a pharmacy school. -Yep. One of the best.
Remind me. What's their mascot?
-Excuse me. -It's okay.
What's your story, for real?
[Maria] All right. For real.
Out of school I sold tires… for minimum wage plus commission,
which my manager kept.
Um, I did that for ten years, quit,
and now I do the same sort of shit selling shower doors.
Um, CPAP machines, hot tubs…
Parakeets, essential oils, these pump-up penis things.
Body shots. Lap dances.
My own dignity.
Why do you want to sell pharmaceuticals?
When the child support is late, my kid doesn't eat.
So I can stop lying to my kids about what I do for a living.
What makes you think you can close a doctor with our drug?
It's a best-in-class medication
with one-tenth the onset time of the competition.
Because, for a 10% commission, I'd eat flaming razor blades.
Because I'm banging an oncologist in Plant City.
I did field marketing for Malibu Rum,
and I was Miss Hawaiian Tropic, Pensacola.
-Hell no. -Sweet Jesus, yes.
Come on.
Because my dad's a pain doc,
and he said he'll write your drug if you hire me.
[Liza] 67 in a 65?
Welcome to the team.
Hell to the motherfucking no.
You can hire the sex toy if I can hire my mom.
You'll regret it.
So will you.
Dr. Jack's rule.
PhDs only.
Well, none of them are PhDs.
"Poor, hungry, and dumb."
In your case, the "D" stood for "desperate."
[Liza] What you do today…
informs who you're gonna be tomorrow.
You got to work it like your fucking back's against the wall.
You don't just work the territory, you own your territory.
Okay? You own your territory.
You own a territory, you own a doctor.
-You own your territory, you own a doctor. -[all] Own a doctor.
-You own your territory, you own a doctor! -Own a doctor!
-Own a territory! -You own a doctor!
[Liza] We lived or died by the clinic gatekeepers,
and there's nothing a 50-year-old desk nurse
hates more than a young hot thing half her age pulling twice her salary.
Look, lady, I need to know when I get to see the doctor.
Hey, Sonya. How are you?
-Good to see you. -Hey.
[Liza] Greasing doctors is an art, not a science.
Every drug company's trying to put money in their hands.
You can't just throw checks at 'em. They all think you're wearing a wire.
-I'm just not quite sure… -[Nicole] That you can trust me?
Doctor, I have two mortgages, three kids, one with special needs.
If you join our speakers bureau, you would be my partner and my lifeline.
I will walk through fire to protect you.
[woman] Thank you for sharing, Doctor.
[Liza] And never forget.
Always hire a rep with versatility.
[Jackie] Hey, come with me? Just this first time.
Nope, it's time to spread your wings, little bird.
You got this.
[Liza] And while our blue-chip competitors
were fighting over the marquee MDs at the Mayo Clinic…
Dr. Davis?
Jackie Drake from Zanna.
…we were going after the guys Pfizer wouldn't toss a free pen.
How you doing?
Well, I'm… doing especially well right now, thank you.
And without that platoon of desperate reps,
we'd have never hit our gold mine of desperate doctors.
-Thank you all for coming. -[cork pops]
[Liza] The real education at our events was us learning the doctors
were just as greedy and horny as everyone else.
What made us different?
I'd tell my reps, like, don't treat your doctor like a sale.
Be family to them. Be a friend.
[Liza] We'd pick 'em up at the airport. Walk their dogs.
Sit through a folk-rock serenade if that's their thing.
They needed us.
-So real and thick. -It takes some getting used to.
-But I like it. -Yeah?
I like the way it makes me feel. I walk a little faster, little taller.
[Liza] Got a skip in your step.
Fancy seeing you here.
Smells great.
[Liza] 67 in a 65.
I mean, maybe we pushed it to 70,
but that's what it would take to storm the castle,
to get the best-in-class medication to people who needed it.
It wasn't pretty, but hey, we won.
In one quarter, we'd gone from zero to 86% market share in the southeast.
Own the doctor!
[all] Own your destiny!
[Liza] And even if we won dirty, at the end of the day,
our medicine was reaching the people who really needed it.
What's remarkable? On Saturday, I said, "Kids, we're gonna do something."
"Mommy is out of pain." We went hiking, if you can believe that.
I couldn't. [nurse] The doctor will see you now, Sidney.
[Liza] Everyone was happy. Well, except the competition.
Feel good about yourself?
Stealing my doctors?
Feel great getting cancer patients off your toxic lollipop.
You think you're big shit, huh? You're a joke.
Everybody's laughing about your off-brand speaker programs
you're holding at the nudie bar.
Almost as funny as your programs that are banned 'cause you're crooks.
That just means we can devote our entire marketing budget
to destroy your little peon asses.
-Y'all woke the dragon. -Dragon's in the marketing department?
-He's in the butt-fucking department. -Ooh. And he's gonna love you.
[Liza] Can't wait. Hi, Dr. Lydell!
Enjoy your macaroons.
-Have you been using that elliptical? -Sure bet.
-You look so good. -Working my way up to a 5k.
[Liza] And if you're wondering why Praxiom
didn't just win back their prescribers with better programs, more money,
they couldn't.
[Laurene] Pain is pain.
Arthritis, post-op…
Pain is pain, people. And at--
[Liza] The Feds had nailed their asses for off-label marketing,
aka, paying doctors to prescribe fentanyl,
not just to opioid tolerant cancer patients,
but to whoever, for whatever.
Headaches, hangnails. "Here, have some fentanyl."
So how's the law protecting you from these scumbags?
They're not.
Praxiom didn't get shut down.
Nobody did a day of jail time.
The judge hit 'em with a standard fine,
and they banned them from greasing doctors…
for five years.
Oh my God.
-I could be comfortable here. -[chuckles]
[Phoebe] Well, it's two stories, and I do have my own bedroom now.
[Randy] The company condo? You're still paying rent, though?
[Phoebe] Yeah. I mean, big picture, though,
my closet is bigger than my old room.
We have a fizzy tub, by the way, and my new best friend
is the Gulf of Mexico.
-[Randy] Wow! -Hello. [chuckles]
It's cool, right?
[Randy] Yeah, it looks great.
Uh… Say hi to Mom.
-Hi. -[Randy] Hi.
-Oh my Lord. -Oh my gosh.
-All right, come on. -[Phoebe] Can you believe this place?
[Liza] Hi.
-[laughs] Thank you. Wow. -Mmm.
-We use the wool for textile arts… -[Liza] Mmm.
…and the manure works wonders for our gardenia glade.
-Where do I sign? -[chuckles]
I hate to ask, but we have 80 applications for five spots in the seventh year.
How much are you willing to pay?
Oh, I can pay full tuition.
[Liza] Money's dignity.
Not having to beg for a break.
Can't tell you what it meant to finally be one of those people
you can't shame, shake down, or fuck over.
-Could you pay enhanced tuition? -What's enhanced tuition?
Double.
Why would I pay double?
Well, the school took on some debt to buy the animals,
so to keep the program,
we're having to reach out to our community.
[Liza] And then you climb a couple tax brackets,
and it's the same old grift, only for more money,
and it smells like gardenias and alpaca shit.
Double it is.
[Liza] Hi.
[Jackie] Hey.
-[Liza] Oh my God. -What?
Where there's a popcorn tower, there's you asking me to do something fucked up.
-Oh. Ever heard of just being nice? -Sure.
I'm a little honked off about the speaker programs.
I know, they're fucking gross and over the line,
and after the IPO, we'll bring them into compliance. All good.
No. I love the events, when they let me do one.
-Mom. -But Pete's been giving my speaker money
to that girl who makes sales calls in her underwear.
You bonused 30 grand. You're doing all right.
Tina boasts 125.
I have a really early meeting with Dr. Jack, and I need to focus.
-It's important I get my head around it. -Okay, even better.
Tell him that I think we should deduct honorariums from net sales.
Then I'd probably be, like, number one on my team.
-Okay. -I'm serious.
I will think about it.
Thank you.
[Jackie] Hi!
-[Phoebe] Hey. -[Jackie] You need help?
[Phoebe] I guess so.
Do you read French?
Your mom never asked you for a favor?
No. Dead.
Okay, your dad.
Him too.
God, Pete, I'm so sorry.
Don't be. They would have been shitty grandparents.
They what?
Really? Would have thought she leaked it.
Tina's knocked up.
So the moral of quarter three, $96 million in the Southeast.
The speaker programs work.
And if the 86% market share metric scales, which it will,
implementing the speaker programs nationwide,
we'll be within spitting distance of a billion a year.
Minus half a billion in fines for any kickback violations.
Uh, no, because, as Pete mentioned,
post IPO we'll be running the programs through a compliance team. Thanks.
Because compliance, ethics, that's your thing, Liza?
-Should be all of our thing, Brent. -[Brent] Yeah, it should.
By the way, I got this weird package from a Randy Drake, your ex-husband.
He wanted to correct a few things on the bio from your site.
You actually didn't go to college, or finish high school,
and before joining our team, you got naked for money.
-Fucking give me that. -Hold on now! Hold on.
I'm guessing that's how you two met.
And as far as your illuminated career in pharma…
that you made up.
Unless you count your time as a drug trafficker,
which got you a felony conviction in 2010.
I sold THC gummies.
Some to people in chronic pain, which I think actually--
[Brent] And you served three months,
meaning you lied about the jail question on the application too.
Was that a… envelope slap on my desk?
I just thought you should know the truth.
Truth is you're being disrespectful to that young lady.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
-I disagree, sir. I… I think… -[thuds]
[Jack] I didn't ask you what your opinion was.
Liza Drake helped save this company.
Liza, I'm gonna promote you to national sales director.
Jesus, thank you so much.
Thank you.
I oughta bitch-slap you.
Pete?
Yes, sir.
You're the new COO.
Thank you, sir.
-Sir, I'm not gonna work under Pete. -[Pete] You know what, Brent?
I'm not gonna let you quit.
Pete, come on.
Not without telling you from the bottom of my heart…
go fuck yourself, you goddamn snake.
You're fired.
Fuck, Pete.
Z-N-N-A. Guy Schatz is all in on Zanna.
Pharma company out of Florida,
just owning the market for breakthrough cancer pain.
[all] Three, two, one!
♪ I graduated from the college In the street ♪
♪ 'Cause I'm a scholar… ♪
[Guy] Unbelievable. Cinderella three-day 400% gain.
These guys went from, "Who the hell is that?"
to the number one IPO this year.
This is The Bullpen. Guy Schatz.
[Liza] Pete and I were promoted again.
Him to CEO, and me to Marketing VP.
You slew Goliath!
We're the Golden fucking Horde.
We own cancer.
What do we do? We own cancer!
[Liza] Right after the IPO, just as things were looking really good,
the pressures of success started to get to the boss,
and he got weird.
All right, attention, everyone!
Look down around you.
Look at the floor and see how dirty it is.
You know how much it costs to polish this floor?
$80,000!
So from now on, at Zanna Therapeutics, we will be working with our shoes off!
Is it me, or is he losing his shit?
I think he's keeping it in buckets in his house.
-[Jack] Don't look at me. -He's a great man, don't be respectful.
[Jack] Do you have ugly toes? Get a pedicure!
You have ugly feet? Wear socks!
Hey! Get your shoes off!
Get your shoes off!
[Liza] And the whole demented miser thing,
it did not bode well for the plan to clean up the speaker programs.
Well, I think a compliance department is a needless expense.
Sir, a huge federal fine is a needless expense.
-I feel compliance is a bargain. -[Jack] A bargain?
We built this company because we weren't afraid to go in for the kill.
Goddamn right.
Sir, look, I just want to say,
when Pete and Liza began this strategy of paying doctors for prescriptions,
which, by the way, I did not sign off on,
well, that was…
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!
-[Pete] Open your pocket! -Fuck!
-Fucking stop. No! -[Pete] Open this fucking pocket!
[recording playing] Paying doctors for prescriptions…
-[Eric] All right. I can-- -He's got his shoes on!
[Pete] Snake! Get the fuck outta here!
-All right! I'm going! -Get outta here.
[Eric] I fucked up, okay? I'm sorry. I apologize!
It was just for me. For my protection.
[Liza] Paley swore he wasn't ratting to law enforcement.
I love you, Jack!
[Liza] He was just paranoid that if the shit ever came down
or somebody filed a whistleblower suit, he'd wanna be ready to file a better one.
So he was out and as miserable as a man can be…
after cashing in $32 million in company stock.
[Eric] Yeah!
-I fucking love my life! Whoo! -[siren wailing]
-[woman] Fuck it! -[man] Yeah!
[all chanting] Chug, chug, chug!
Hey, Ryan. Are you shitting in the sink?
[Ryan] That's a complicated question.
[Pete] Oh shit, I almost forgot.
Your options contract.
$6 million at close.
Probably be 20 when you sell.
I don't need 20. I'll just take six.
[sighs] Well, can't sell till you vest.
What the fuck is vest?
Never mind. Whatever it is, I'll do it.
It's when you've been with the company for a year,
so, six more months, you can sell.
Just launched the IPO of the year, you don't know about options?
Yeah, I don't know shit.
This is a goddamn moment right here.
Shit on, laughed at.
Thinking you're not gonna get there, and then you fucking get there.
Rich?
[Pete] Safe.
I feel the same.
Good. I'm glad.
No, I mean, I don't feel any different. I feel just the fucking same.
What is it? What? What's up your ass?
Don't you sometimes wish that we were here 'cause we done something remarkable,
something meaningful, and not because everyone's a greedy piece of shit?
-Ever think that? -What do you want me to tell ya?
-Fix the programs. -Can I see your tits?
[Liza] Oh my God.
Sorry, that came out wrong.
I'm married.
Come on. You're making it weird. Stop.
-[Pete] You know, I really love you. Just… -Stop this. Stop.
Is there any version of this where we end up fucking? Never. Never.
Never. Never.
[Pete] Okay.
Jack.
You're leaving me?
[whispers] I'm gonna get us some coffee.
Relax. I'm joking.
Thanks for last night. It was really…
It was really nice.
Oh… My putty tat is howling.
-Do you have any cranberry juice? -Gross.
What? Is it so horribly shocking to find out your mother is a human being?
You know what's horrible?
I'm finally being treated with respect for the first time in my life,
and you embarrass me. But shocking? No.
-You are such a tight-ass. -[sighs]
It was fun.
I don't want to know.
Till he started crying.
[Liza] I don't know if it was a direct result of him fucking my mom or what,
but right after our victory party, the boss got even weirder.
[guard] Phones in the bag, please.
-Handbag. -[metal detector beeps]
Shoes.
Can I get you a drink?
Yeah, whatever you're having.
Oh, you don't deserve to have what I'm having.
The fuck is going on in Birmingham?
-What's happening in Birmingham? -Our man in Birmingham.
-[Liza] -Dr. Frazier? -Dr. Frazier.
You know how many scripts Dr. Frazier wrote last week?
-No. -[Jack] Four.
You know how many he wrote this week? Four. You see the problem?
Our sales are flat. F-L-A-T. Flat. You're fucking killing this company.
Sales are flat at $170 million a quarter 'cause we won cancer.
If you don't grow, you die. Where's the growth?
-In other markets with other medications. -Lonafen is another medication!
The doctors don't know it because our messaging is fucked!
Our messaging?
There are millions of people out there in agony,
suffering from kidney stones, and fibromyalgia and post-operative pain.
And we're telling our doctors, you can't treat 'em unless it's cancer?
Why cancer?
The FDA only approved Lonafen for opioid tolerant cancer patients.
I hear you. I think Dr. Neel's point… Liza.
-What? -What Dr. Neel is saying,
and it's an excellent point, is that pain is pain.
Thank you very much. That's exactly it.
-Pain is pain. -[inaudible]
So we're gonna get Lonafen approved for kidney stones? Is…
You're not fucking saying that we're going off label.
Can you excuse us so I can have a conversation with Liza?
Yeah.
Sir, you cannot message, "pain is pain."
-You cannot push this drug off-label. -[Jack] Liza, Liza.
-It is not-- -[yelling] Liza! Liza! Liza!
That conversation is over.
-How's your apartment? -Very nice.
-Are you comfortable? -Very. It's gorgeous. We're very grateful.
[grunts] There's something I gotta show you.
[whispers] Oh, fuck.
I got this from…
-My mom. -Your mother.
-She has sent me three of these. -Oh God. I'm so sorry.
You violated our HR process by hiring your mother.
-And that-- -How?
How? [scoffs] 'Cause you hired your mother.
And you didn't clear it with me.
You have to get rid of her.
And you have to take responsibility that she never contacts me again.
And… you're gonna get her signature on this.
When do your options vest, Liza?
In November.
[Jack] In November.
You can go now.
[Pete] Pain is pain!
[all] Yes!
You know from your doctors we've done wonders with cancer patients.
What about migraines? What about post-op pains?
-They should just suffer? -[all] No!
[Pete] Fuck that.
Fuck cancer.
Pain…
[all] Is pain!
-[Pete] Pain… -[all] Is pain!
-[Pete] Pain… -[all] Is pain.
[Pete] There it is!
[Liza] I need you to sign it, please.
So sorry, please just sign it.
-All right? -[Jackie] All right.
No. What?
This…
That doesn't make sense. What did I do?
Dr. Neel didn't love your, um, popcorn towers.
Oh, fuck him. I was trying to be nice.
Really? Out of the goodness of your heart you thought,
"That demented billionaire would love Cracker Jack. I'm gonna do it."
-What's wrong with that? No. -Everything.
-What's wrong with that? No. -Everything. Liza, you weren't helping me with my bribe money, and I thought…
-Jack would put in a word. -Oh God.
Did you ask Dr. Neel for more speaker money?
What is wrong with you?
It's the least he could do. What's it to him?
No. What's it to me? What's it to me?
I put my neck out to get you this job, and you embarrass me.
You embarrass yourself.
Really? I fucked the boss in front of the whole company?
-Don't be nasty. -I'm not being nasty.
I am the one person, Liza,
the one person in your life who stuck by you.
When everyone else was all "Crazy Liza blew it again,"
-I held my tongue. -Did you?
-I said-- -You thought I was a loser too?
-No. -And you just lied about it?
Is that your big fucking triumph as a mom? Good for you.
No, I'm saying I… I stood by you!
I gave my life for you girls.
Mom, come on. You gave us to Meemaw and PopPop
so you could cruise the Intracoastal with the dude of the week.
Give me a break. Come on, you know you did.
When did you become an ingrate?
You're… Oh God.
You would have none of this if it wasn't for me.
You know what? Okay.
Name one thing you ever taught me beside, "Get your ass hitched young
and squeeze out a kid so he won't leave you."
Name one thing you ever did for me. One.
I made you a survivor.
I survived you, Mom!
I'm here because of me!
Come on, babe, we gotta scoot, okay?
[reporter] …shows that Americans are downing massive amounts of prescription pills.
Look at this. Right now, seven million people in this country
use prescription drugs for…
[Phoebe] You okay?
Yeah. Okay.
Okay.
Get your backpack. We're gonna go.
Let's go.
-Yeah. -[Pete] Dr. Jack's spitting fire.
Wants to know why we're not seeing Lydell's off-label scripts.
Because I'm only just now getting to the clinic. Okay?
Bring your phone and conference me in. I'll back you up.
-I know how to talk to my own prescriber. -Then don't fuck it up!
[Dr. Lydell in German] You give me your word?
Okay, Daddy, I love you too. Okay, I love you--
I have to go. Someone's here.
[in English] Didn't know you spoke German.
I am German.
-Came over when I was six. -Wow. How'd I not know that?
Maybe because you're not all that interested.
What? That's not true. Why would you say that?
Are things good? Is everything okay?
Why wouldn't they be?
I don't know.
What do we got?
Mostly filets and prime rib.
[Dr. Lydell] You doing okay?
Just a little stressed, I think.
-Come here. -No, I'm okay.
Bring it in.
-Well, I feel better. -Great.
-Can we go inside? -Sure.
Wanna tell me what's going on with you?
Um… There's something I need to discuss with you, between us if that's all right.
Please. Anything.
-[cell phone chimes] -What is it?
They're wanting us to…
lean on prescribers to write Lonafen off-label.
-Ah. -I had to put it out there, but I'm happy to say you refused.
Did I say that?
No. But it's--
-Then don't put words in my mouth. -I'm not…
You know better than me…
that you can't be writing Lonafen for migraines or whatever.
Where'd you do your medical training again?
What's going on? I'm just looking out for you.
By asking me to abandon my professional judgment
and defer to yours?
-That's not what I'm saying. -I want a rebate… of 25% gross
on all the off-label scripts I write.
Will that work?
Stop it.
[Matt] It's not about pain… fentanyl.
[Matt] It's not about pain… fentanyl. What it does,
it releases the same neurochemicals a mother feels
the first time she holds her own baby.
I mean, that feeling is literally why humans exist.
So for me, the off-label thing came at the perfect time.
[Matt] The doctor just found out that my cancer was in remission…
which I hadn't told him so he'd keep the Lonafen flowing.
If anything, the pain's getting worse.
I guess neuropathy from the chemo.
So let's keep you on the Lonafen if it's working for you.
[Matt] For one thing, it was making my days on the car lot a lot easier.
Mr. Jorgensen…
You ever get tired of smiling?
Uh… No.
You will if I send you home in that Elantra.
That's a Toyota.
Same thing.
♪ My old homegrown recipe Will see us through ♪
Hey!
Ben… they're supposed to take two steps back.
-And they're only taking half a step. -[man] No.
Cinda, we're not doing this today. -It's our final rehearsal. -[phone vibrating]
-We're on in ten. -[Cinda] Or something like half…
Hey, you want to tell me why Dr. Frazier in Birmingham
just wrote two Xeraphen scripts?
[Nicole] It's okay, they didn't even get paid.
The patient had some vouchers.
No, you don't get it, Nicole. Okay?
They're penetrating our market. They're hurting the share price.
-You need to fucking fix this. -[man] Okay. Back to one.
Pheeb! Hey!
-Do you understand me? -[man] Hey! Excuse me, Miss Drake!
-I don't know what's going on. -Oh my God. Oh my God.
[muffled] Step back.
It's okay. It's okay, step back.
It's okay, baby. It's okay, honey.
It's okay, breathe…
Look at me, honey.
It's okay. That's it. Can you guys step back a bit? Thank you.
That's it, baby. That's it. Just breathe.
It's outpouching another three millimeters since your last visit.
I'm afraid we can't wait until December.
I think the procedure could wait two weeks?
I wouldn't wait for it.
[Liza] Oh my God, baby.
Phoebe, you gotta keep these meds down, babe, okay?
You need to try and keep them down.
-I'm not your fucking employee. -I'm not--
-No, don't yell at me! -Stop. I'm not. I'm not.
It's okay. Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, baby.
So I saved what I could. I got about 235…
$239,000 cash.
Sure, and the size of the loan?
$450,000. So, I was hoping that I could borrow against my stock options,
which are worth close to $15 million.
Almost certainly more when they vest in November.
Unfortunately, Miss Drake, pharma's a very volatile sector,
and from underwriting's perspective,
too much can happen in three months.
I'm really sorry.
[Liza] At that point, all I could think to do
is get on my hands and knees to the one person who A, had the cash,
and B, might like a nice fat favor to lord over me.
But then everything changed.
And the crazy thing is, none of us saw it coming.
Not us, and sure as shit not our doctors.
We're all basically that turkey on the farm living their best life.
Every day, like every other day, eating a tasty dish of corn.
And after about a year,
the third Thursday in November rolls around.
[Kate] You son of a bitch!
-[Dr. Lydell] Oh fuck! -[Kate] Matt Elliston, remember him?
He OD'd this morning, and he would've died
if the dog hadn't found him face down in the basement!
Get the fuck off of me. I'm gonna sue your ass.
-[Dr. Lydell] Get her out. -I'm gonna sue you.
-Get outta here! -[Kate] I said get off of me!
-[door closes] -Fuck.
[Dr. Lydell] Fuck.
I'm not writing you more Vicodin. You failed your pill count.
I've gotta have something, doc.
Jesus.
Put that away.
All right, let's try something new.
You squirt it under your tongue.
It's for cancer pain.
That mole on the side of your cheek, have you had it checked out?
-No. -Well, it looks cancerous to me.
[man] Yeah.
-[Liza] Excuse me. -You got Lonafen?
-No, I don't. -[woman] She's got Lonafen!
-I don't carry the drug. -She's got Lonafen!
-I have cash. -[Liza] Holy shit.
-I don't carry the drug, okay? -[man] I've seen you here.
You have to wait for Dr. Lydell.
Step away from the car, please.
Step away!
-It's not good. -[Liza] It's a calamity.
-A disaster-- -[Pete] Losing Lydell will
pinch quarter three. No way around that,
but we can offset the loss in scripts by refining our dosing message.
-What? -That's correct.
The model's not sustainable with low-mic scripts.
-The cheap doses were killing us. -Correct.
I think we go with titration next. Higher doses, higher commissions.
What about Lydell's patients?
-We'll have to find them. -That's what I'm talking about.
Where they're going to. Get those doctors on our program--
I mean the dead ones.
[Pete] It's not our fault.
No. From our lawyers,
our patients are on such a high baseline of other schedule II's,
we can't be solely implicated in this.
-[phone ringing] -I got to take this. Who's that?
-Didn't I say no phones? -We huddle tomorrow.
Go over the messaging for the conference. Something fun. Something light.
Right?
Yeah?
[Liza] I figure we maybe had 24 hours before the company went down.
So I thought, what the hell?
You all right?
-I need to talk to you about something. -What's up?
-My daughter, remember Phoebe? -Of course.
She's not doing good.
-And, um, she needs surgery. -Oh.
And insurance won't cover it.
And I put aside as much as I could, but I need another 450 to pay for it.
I'm not asking for a gift.
I was just thinking I could sell you my stock options.
Before you vest?
What, you're not thinking of leaving us, are you, Liza?
-No. -[Jack] Mmm.
Her surgery's next month though, and I don't vest till November.
-So, it's a problem. -[Jack] Yeah. I see the problem.
But here's the thing.
When my wife was dying, I was so benumbed with shock and grief
that I didn't realize that her illness brought with it a secret gift,
a new sense of time, a creative fire.
Use your crisis as your fire.
You'd be amazed at what you're capable of.
Well, you can start by running down those patients.
Crisis.
Fire.
Come on now.
Phoebe needs you.
[Liza] Hi.
Hi, baby.
Mom.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's all right, baby. It's okay.
Just go to your sister, okay?
Just wanted to bring you back your…
Oh God. [crying]
I'm so sorry, Camille.
You didn't do anything.
It's not your fault.
You're not a bad person.
[Liza] I will not give up on myself.
I will not give up on my dreams.
I will make my life count.
I will make my life count.
-You should have a lawyer present. -[Liza] That's fine.
I want you to know…
that I helped build… our speaker program.
Our bribery program.
Tried to bring it into compliance.
Who else signed off on these programs?
Eric Paley.
Pete Brenner.
Jack Neel.
Oh, it all came down from Jack. I'll testify to that.
[sighs] We need more than your testimony…
because this is how this will go.
Neel will hire these incredible lawyers
who'll tell this sad story to the jury about a sweet old man
who got taken in by a master crook named Liza Drake.
No, I came in as a low-level rep. He's a fucking billionaire with a PhD.
Fair point. But if you don't want to eat your boss's share on this,
we need proof tying Neel to the bribery scheme.
What kind of proof?
Documents. Voice recordings.
You don't get it. He never touches the day-to-day and he's…
he hasn't been in the office since the IPO.
You can't get near him with a phone.
He has this guy, he has a guy with a wand thing--
Texts, emails.
Bring us something proving Neel's involvement, we can deal.
He has a flip phone, he doesn't email.
The way it works is you… I…
We would email… the CEO…
-[Jane] Brenner. -Yeah.
And then Brenner prints a hard copy, and then Jack marks it up and…
Brenner gives us the gist of it and eats the original. I don't know.
Can you bring us some of those printouts?
And we'll tell the judge no jail time.
[Liza] Dr. Jack was right about one thing.
There's nothing so inspiring as sheer desperation.
I wrote an e-mail to Pete saying I tracked down Lydell's patients
to 18 different doctors
and that I needed a quarter mil right away to get 'em into the program.
I said they wanted golf memberships, college tuition bills,
all sorts of things for Jack to have opinions about.
And Dr. Jack, bless his heart, he put his stink all over the document.
And Brenner, per my instructions,
he brought it to our sales meeting, which was going down that night.
Okay, so this Patton guy.
Low decile.
Jack says no way to this college bill until he proves himself.
Nice tights.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Get out there and clap.

-Triple commissions on 1,600 mics! -[audience cheering]
That's what I'm talking about. Y'all feel me?
[Pete] Liza!
Where are you going? It's breakout groups.
Yeah, Phoebe's sick, so, Nicole's gonna take mine, okay?
-Okay. -Okay.
-Sorry, anything I can do? -All good. She'll be fine.
See you tomorrow.
-Thoughts and prayers. -Yeah, thanks.
Jesus, fuck.
-Give me this shit! -What the fuck!
You appalling piece of shit.
When'd they get to ya?
I went to them.
Why would you do that?
Why would you do that, Liza? God damn it!
Remember where you were when I scooped you outta there?
-I know. -When I gave you a shot?
I gave you a fucking life, and you do this to me?
Pete, we killed people.
Oh, bullshit!
We did this, and now you're out there and you're, like, bonusing higher doses.
-We don't write the scripts! -People are dead because of us!
Do you not get that? Do you just not care? What's wrong with you?
You care? Funny how it took your whale getting busted
for you to sprout a conscience!
-Fuck you, dude. -What'd they give you?
Must've been good to get a greedy fuck like you to rat before you cashed out.
-Oh, you don't know me. -I am you, Liza!
We're just selfish pieces of shit. Only with you, there's no limit.
No, I'm nothing like you.
I hope you fucking die.
[Jack] Pete, we're gonna contain this.
You just need to stick to a certain truth.
What does that mean?
[man] You're implicated, Pete.
There's no way around that.
Dr. Neel's gonna handle your legal expenses. Look…
We're gonna get you the most advantageous plea deal--
And meet my kid for the first time behind plexiglass?
No. No fucking way. I'm not doing that. No.
[man] Prison's not on the table,
but your assets, your house, your savings,
that's probably all going away.
Pete. Pete, I love you like a son. I'm gonna take care of you.
I'll ensure that you and your family will be comfortable
for the rest of your lives.
-Your house, your cars… -[dog whining]
…college for your child.
You need to trust me.
If I testify that you knew nothing.
[Jack] It's the best thing for everyone.
-[banging on door] -[officer] Police! Open the door, sir!
Pete? Pete…
[Liza] They even caught up with Eric Paley down in Argentina.
-[man] You ready to talk? -Yeah.
Dr. Neel had no knowledge of the conspiracy.
[Liza] But not before Neel's lawyer did.
[nurse] Miss Drake? Your daughter's in recovery.
Is she doing okay?
She is. She did really well.
Baby.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
[Liza] And while everyone else was going down,
Neel stuck to his bullshit, and no one could prove he was lying.
He was on the cover of Forbes.
When they asked him about the charges on everyone who'd touched the company…
My involvement?
I was an investor.
I had no knowledge of the daily operations.
I was a passive investor.
[Jackie] Please forgive me.
[Liza] I'm so sorry too.
-[Jackie] Oh. -[Liza] I'm so happy to see you.
-Hi, Meemaw. -[Jackie] Oh, hi, sweet girl.
How you doing?
[Phoebe] I'm okay. I'm just dandy.
Mom, when you were shaking down Jack Neel for more speaker money…
-We seriously relitigating this? -No, no, no.
When you reached out to him, did you call him?
He wouldn't give me his number.
Just his email.
Did you email him… directly?
How many times?
A few.
Did you save 'em?
[Jackie] "Should be aware that, for example,
Tina Murphy got $8,000 in speaker money for Dr. Jacob, and I got 900 bucks."
[Liza] Okay, okay. Go on. Keep…
[Jackie] "$22,000,
Andrea Welch, who's such a crappy rep, she needs all the bribe money that she--"
Did he respond?
Uh… Scroll.
Mom… Oh my God. Thank God you're so fucking slutty!
[Liza] The headlines following Dr. Jack's arrest were less than pretty.
They talked about Adrienne Jenkins,
daughter,
22-year-old Lonafen patient found dead,
toxic levels of fentanyl in her blood.
Emma Kowalski, mother.
Sam Walter, husband.
[interviewer] Wait, can I stop you there?
[Liza] Sure, what?
[interviewer] You yourself said the overdose risk was less than 1%…
According to the study.
-The study? -The Hartigan study out of Mass General.
Elliot Hartigan. I authored the Lonafen study.
[interviewer] The study was false?
The study was accurate.
Out of a test group of 200 patients under clinical observation for two years,
there was only one confirmed fentanyl overdose.
What they left out
was that the drug was administered to opioid tolerant patients
by responsible doctors
who weren't being paid to crank the doses and addict people.
Not only that,
the clinical subjects were stage 4 cancer patients.
So before abuse became an issue,
most of them were dead.
For non-terminal patients,
they concluded that the risk of overdose and addiction
were all incredibly high… because, um…
well, pardon me, but no shit,
it's fentanyl.
Yeah, I… I trusted the study.
[interviewer] The cancer pain study.
And then you bribed doctors to prescribe Lonafen for headaches.
Yeah.
In addition to fines and restitution,
Dr. Lydell, I sentence you to a period of 40 months.
Sixteen months.
Thirty-six months.
Sixty-six months.
We wrote this statement…
where I was gonna say how naive I was coming into this.
That how when I told my bosses…
that things didn't seem right…
they said we're playing by the rules,
and that I believed them, and I went along with it.
I was supposed to say I didn't go to pharmacy school.
It wasn't me writing the prescriptions, it wasn't my fault.
But that would be a lie.
I helped build this thing.
And I knew it was wrong.
The truth is, I wanted the money.
I wanted the respect.
And I wanted it so badly, I stopped caring how I got it.
And now people's lives have been destroyed.
Am I sorry?
Yes.
But I did what I did.
On behalf of the government,
I just want to restate the enormity of what this case has accomplished.
For the first time, top pharmaceutical executives
are going to prison for their roles in the opioid crisis,
and we couldn't have done it without the cooperation of Liza Drake.
Therefore, we recommend no imprisonment
to send an important message to people in her position
to stand up and do the right thing.
[judge] I appreciate the government's recommendation
and Miss Drake's contrition, which I do believe to be genuine.
But your greed cost lives.
You can't erase it with cooperation.
This gives me no pleasure whatsoever,
but you are going to prison, Miss Drake.
Please stand.
I sentence you to a period of incarceration
of one year and three months.
[Pete] Yeah. A lot of shame.
There's lot of guilt.
Lot of stuff you can only work out with, you know, God.
But a thing can be two things at the same time.
You know?
There's a lot of people that I could name that have gone through their entire lives
without ever doing a fucking thing for anybody.
Yes… we hurt people.
Yes… we destroyed lives.
But we also brought people,
suffering people,
the best medication for cancer breakthrough pain
the world has ever seen.
[interviewer] Really? You still believe that?
You sell what's in your bag.
[Liza] I feel if you went for the eye invigorator
and the pore refiner, that would be a good combo for you.
-[woman] Let me try it? -A little on your hand?
-Yes, please. -Feel how smooth that is?
Yes. Dab it?
Put it up there, and it'll light you up.
It's all natural, all made by hand, all by my mother,
and she's right over there in blue.
She's 68 years old. Can you believe that?
-This stuff works. It works! -[woman] I wouldn't believe it.
Oh, he probably fathered half the kids in Tampa, but wow, could he sing.
You were married four times?
That one was annulled.
That's kinda hot.
Oh, Ryan, no.
To me, it smell like a dead body.
But let me show you something.
-This… -Hey, Nicole?
-I'm gonna go grab some lunch. -Okay.
-[Liza] You hold it down? -All right!
Feel this.
[Liza] The old life, I don't think about.
Only sometimes…
when I'm trying to fall asleep at night.
I'm gonna get a shot of Cuervo.
-Got it. -Thanks.
I have those dreams that aren't really dreams,
where I'm running the company,
I've pulled us back from the crooked shit,
and people look at me like I'm somebody.
And it feels so good that it scares me.
So I sit up, and I turn on the light.
The founder of the pharmaceutical company who was convicted of orchestrating
a kickback and bribery scheme involving opioids
receiving his sentence today.
Well, John Kapoor, the founder of this company,
will be going to prison for five and a half years,
and it's a sentence prosecutors hope
sends a strong message to the pharmaceutical industry.
Out of pure greed,
Insys executives from John Kapoor on down
bribed doctors to prescribe this powerful, addictive drug
to people who did not need it.
the imaginary number.
The square root of minus one.
A number that was once considered impossible.
Later it was found that not only was it possible,
but it was also the most basic concept in the universe.
In 1997, I realized the difference
between possible and impossible in my life.
Pi.
The ratio of every circle's circumference and diameter.
There's a pi hidden in every circle.
Like magic.
Another magical number, "e."
Euler's number.
Anything that grows at a natural rate,
like bacteria, is dictated by "e."
And by joining these two irrational numbers with an imaginary one,
we arrive at the most beautiful equation in mathematics.
As I left home,
my eyes were full of tears,
and my mind was full of Euler's Identity.
GOMTI BARRAGE
Avadh Express from Baroni to Bandra Terminus…
Are your shoes stuffed with glue? Walk faster.
We're headed to Surat, and you?
We're going to Bundela Madam's coaching.
Really?
Many of her students made it to
the Indian Institute of Technology this year, right?
Damned kids from everywhere want to be in her coaching.
You need to sit for an exam to get into the coaching classes.
She works with only the crème de la crème.
These days, everyone wants a piece of the IIT dream!
It's the panacea smoothie for success!
Job.
Dignity.
Luxury.
A student from IIT…
looks civilized, even in boxers and slippers.
Sir…
Sir, please.
-Just a couple of drags. -The boy is watching.
Oh, sorry.
Papa secretly craved cigarettes.
But he also believed that smoking is the clear sign
of a life spinning out of control.
He would hide cigarettes, even from himself.
And to ration his lust, he'd smoke only on the national holidays.
That is three times a year.
"Control" was always a hot topic in our home.
Mom was obsessed with sweets.
-Go away! -She hogged so much
that it spiked her cholesterol.
Now, I was the last hope to wrest the control back.
And to achieve that, I was being sent away from home.
Give it to me.
Where to?
Science City, near the canteen.
-Thirty rupees. -I didn't ask for the fare to hell.
I'll give you twenty.
Okay, 25 rupees, come!
Vicky's room?
-Who is he? -I don't know.
Vicky?
Singh uncle.
Your dad must have called you.
Damn, chewing gum.
Close the door.
We'll freshen up and leave.
Write the exam sincerely.
Don't flunk on purpose in the hopes that I'll take you back to Lucknow.
This city is the Haridwar of coaching.
I'll find a temple that will take you.
I could have enrolled in Lucknow University.
University is the shadow of a black mamba.
It is filled with bullies.
Kids with character go to IIT.
Go on.
Hello.
Yes, my boy.
How's your health?
I'm back at the phone booth.
Did you clear the coaching admission?
Yes, Mom, I got in.
I knew it.
You are the best.
Did you meet Vicky?
Yes. We left the luggage in his room.
It's a trash can. He has turned the room into a landfill.
I'm not surprised.
Their house here stinks like a gutter.
Where is your dad?
He's here.
We will finalize a room in a couple of days.
Then he'll come back home.
Take a toffee instead of change.
This is worth less than the change.
Are the rooms expensive?
Yes.
Thousand rupees a month.
Papa says I should live alone and not in a shared accommodation.
Son, don't worry.
We will manage.
Your dad is using his savings.
Mom.
Yes, my boy?
Mom, I don't want to stay here.
Son, I know.
But how to convince your father?
It sucks here. Everything feels sad and empty.
Even the house feels empty without you.
Mom, I will study well in Lucknow. I promise you.
Vivek.
This place is yucktastic!
Vivek, you'll get used to it.
Okay, four minutes are almost done. Do you want to continue?
No.
Eat the laddus I gave you, okay?
I'll make them last through the year.
But you don't eat sweets. The doctor has warned you.
I won't. I won't. Okay?
We used to live in jungles once
Now we eat gourmet food
We walked the steppes once
-And now send dogs into space -How long is the guarantee for?
It's good quality plastic. Unbreakable.
There must be some promise of durability. One year? Two years?
Sir, I told you. It's good quality.
It won't break even if you slam it on the ground.
It won't break even if I slam it?
Yes.
What is this?
Are you insane?
I'll take it.
We fought many wars
And killed many brave ones
For one theory of Newton's We ignored many poets
This world…
This world might be "What the Duck" in motion
But I'll kill to belong here
Dancing till my last breath
I'll kill to belong here
That's my right!
That's my right!
Keep the books upright.
Don't worry about your mom.
She'll be fine.
If you want The Shawshank Redemption, you'll have to crawl through the gutter.
That's the only way.
-When faced with enemies -Understood?
We'll use dy/dx on them
We'll lock them up
In the logic gates of computing
We're on a bloody quest for knowledge
No reason will work with us
Call us nerdy or geeky
Just don't call us mediocre!
Speed is incredible and brakes are missing
We have no idea
How to stop
How do you feel? Are you fine?
Our country is the best.
This was the 50th year of India's Independence.
But my freedom was being snatched away.
In the 90s, they liberalized the markets
and screwed the joy of us Gen-Xers.
Life was stress-free for my father's generation.
Get born in a village.
Go to study in the nearest town.
And get a job in the nearest city.
But now, it is a world of satellite TV dreams.
Dreams only IIT could fulfill.
On the lines of MIT in America,
the first Indian Institute of Technology came up in 1956
at a British Era Detention Camp near Kharagpur.
A jail turned into a college campus!
By the 1990s, the IIT dream boomed, and coaching classes popped up
where a million students enrolled,
competing for the 2500 seats of IIT.
Like the World Wars saw teenagers getting enlisted,
we were getting enlisted in this war of our own.
But be it a soldier or a student,
the brain was still of a 17-year-old hormonal kid,
floating in the river of fantasies,
wanting to smash into the walls of ecstasy.
I'm Rinku and he's Chandan.
Are you guys new here?
Are we new?
Guess our good skin hides our actual age.
We've been prepping for IIT for three years now.
Would you have an extra candle?
Yes, sure. But show us your room first.
This one, right?
Yes.
Room number 14. Excellent.
Investigation…
This is an investigation
Did you bring anything to eat from home?
What rank are you aiming for?
-I haven't thought about it. -You must have.
No.
Did you get any cookies?
Oh, laddus!
Give them back, please!
-I have only 52. -I'll give it back.
First, tell me this,
what All India Rank are you hoping to get?
I haven't thought about it.
You have not?
Okay, pick up the guitar.
You promised to give me a candle but took away my laddus.
Mom gave them for the entire year.
Careful!
It's very expensive.
I asked my father for money for books
and bought the guitar with that money.
I mean, you must have some dream.
No. I have no dreams.
This is my papa's dream.
Why do fathers inject their own dreams into their kids' eyes?
Come to our room.
Do one thing.
Look behind the box. I kept it there yesterday.
Yes.
Here. Found it.
Have fun.
See.
Thanks to your laddus and the candle, you got to see this beautiful room.
We've got everything, from salivation to salvation.
What do you want?
My laddus.
Are you a "good kid"?
How about some beer?
What?
We were just like you when we first came here.
Hey! Listen!
ENTER FOR THE SAKE OF KNOWLEDGE
That row is reserved for girls.
Excited?
Yes.
-Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning. Good morning.
Sit, sit down.
Thank you.
Did everyone have breakfast?
Yes, ma'am.
What did you eat?
-Upma. -Poha.
Poha… And?
Didn't anybody eat paratha with butter?
No? Okay.
Remember this moment.
Because I'll ask you again in a month.
You'll be so immersed in studies
that half of you will have skipped your breakfast,
and the other half will not remember what they ate.
Pay attention, sir.
Come on.
-Let's begin. -Papa says, "My son
Will be rich and famous one day!"
But who knows really
Where my destiny lies
Papa says, "My son Will be rich and famous one day!"
Nice words, right? Everybody knows this song?
Yes, ma'am!
What's the connection between this song and this book?
Can somebody tell me?
Give it a try. At least, take a guess.
Anybody?
Yes. Speak up.
Ma'am, it's from the movie Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak.
In the climax, the hero stabs himself.
Had he read this physics book, he would've known that
to stab oneself, the knife's initial velocity,
as well as acceleration, should be very high.
It's beyond human limits.
It's not possible, ma'am.
It's not. That's very funny.
But it's the wrong answer.
Sit down. Anybody else?
Nobody?
The director of Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak is Mansoor Khan.
A graduate of IIT Bombay!
The writer of the best book of physics "Concepts Of Physics,"
is H.C. Verma sir.
A doctorate from IIT Kanpur.
Moral of the story?
Once you get into an IIT,
whichever field you choose,
success will…
Kiss your feet!
See how he blushed at the mention of a kiss!
GUPTA CANTEEN
My greetings to all new students.
Consider this canteen your home.
Homemade bread. Homemade lentil soup.
Fresh veggies.
The lentil soup has as much water as the atmosphere has nitrogen.
As much salt as oxygen.
And lentils, only as much as argon.
Homemade lentil soup, my ass!
Lectures, university politics, everything has started.
But tell me,
have you made any friends?
Who will make friends with me?
Even you're my friend by accident.
Listen! Before anyone finds out how boring you are,
trap some naive kids!
Are you contesting the university polls?
Totally planning to.
It would've been great if you were here as well.
I know, man. But Papa wants me to be an IITian.
Then become one. It's not a sin.
Your papa will also say you didn't fart for a century,
but when you did, it launched a spaceship!
I really don't know.
Everybody around me is so excited
that I feel like a moth in a classroom full of butterflies.
I'm very confused. Maybe--
Once you settle down, things will feel much easier.
Let me finish.
We are eating peanuts instead of cookies…
so we can pay for your coaching classes.
So don't tell me this moth-butterfly bullshit story.
Give it to me.
-Bye. -Hello--
It would make me furious. Why must IIT be the only choice?
The 1990s was the time when it took five years to get a telephone connection.
Four months for a cooking cylinder.
Eight hours to pay the electricity bill.
It took eight hours to pay the government!
Papa believed that admission into IIT
would make our middle-class anxieties vanish.
Papa got this coaching idea from Monu.
And Monu got this idea from a slap.
He lived in a violent house.
If the slippers were lying upside down, his father would slap him.
If water spilled on the fan's motor, his father would slap him.
If the bathroom bulb was left switched on, his father would slap him.
But then, one day, Monu had had enough. He slapped Raghu uncle back.
He did it all right,
but a sense of shame overtook him soon enough.
He decided he couldn't live here anymore.
The coaching class far away became the perfect reason to leave.
KOTA JUNCTION
But I didn't have any reason for coming here.
Reason?
My reason is love.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Yes.
Absolutely.
Nice. What's her name?
Nandita.
She's preparing to be a doctor back home in Lucknow.
Have you guys kissed?
Yes.
On the cheeks.
You dumbo!
And on the forehead?
On the cheeks!
Your turn.
Do you have one?
Girlfriend.
Of course.
Ishaan, call for you.
That's her calling.
Vivek!
You were lying!
You don't have a girlfriend.
Kota didn't always have coaching classes.
There was only the Chambal River and factories.
Then, the factories started shutting shop,
and people left the city.
But some folks stayed back.
Because they didn't care for the outside world.
Bundela Madam started tuitions with just five kids.
Five turned into fifty,
and fifty into five hundred.
Natural rate of growth, "e."
Then came a time
when she would take classes throughout the day.
Ultimately, she had so many students that
she had to rent an old college
to start her own coaching classes.
"Madam Bundela IIT Coaching."
Despite all her hard work,
she'd regularly get thickheads
who'd doze off mid-lecture.
Good morning.
What did you dream of?
-Yes, ma'am? -Okay, tell me.
In which movie does Dev Anand steal energy?
In which movie does Dev Anand steal "energy"?
The "Joule" Thief.
Go back to sleep now.
Rafiq Shadani wrote a poem that fits R.K. Singh.
A bumbling idiot, a naive hop Goes to a helmet shop
"Show me the cheapest helmet" A head prop
DEPARTMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS
The shopkeeper shows The cheapest costing two dollars
"Show me something cheaper" Our chunky man hollers
The shopkeeper irritated Gives him a cent and a wink
"Get your head shaved with the cent And paint it black with the ink!"
Look, he's here.
He has sent his son to Kota, imitating Raghu's strategy.
Father dies in darkness, son lives in a power station.
Oh, God…
Mr. Singh.
You'll have to come on Sunday.
The telephone lines are dug up.
How can the testing happen without you?
Sir, why is it always me?
-Tell me something. -Yes?
You're running a phone booth with three connections.
Hasn't the government done enough favors for you?
Ask Raghu to come. I have already worked extra shifts.
Raghu is a big shot now.
His son has cracked the IIT, got that?
Offer the sweets to my boss.
Come.
-Touch his feet. -Bless you.
Now, share it with Singh uncle.
Go ahead.
-Here, Uncle. -Congratulations, son.
Thank you, Uncle.
How is Vivek doing at the coaching?
Good. Very good.
He's topping the class.
I was hoping to come home on my birthday.
On your birthday… sure!
Why are you calling him home right before his first mock IIT?
Your papa is already pissed
but come home for two days if you can.
How is your health?
-The sugar level has gone up a bit-- -Give me the phone!
Your papa wants to talk.
How are your studies going?
Fine.
"Fine" won't do.
I've told everybody in the office you'll be a topper.
I want your photo in the newspapers.
I'm studying to my limits.
You can't just stop at your limits.
You have to study to the human limits.
Got it?
You want to add something?
I miss you, my boy.
HUMAN LIMITS
Come on, not again!
Everyone, step out!
Rinku, get the guitar.
Come on!
Vivek! Ishaan! Step out, guys!
Books have all the rosy things
Books have all the cozy things
Nights are never dark in books

Do you really attend the 6:00 a.m. class?
Yes.
Princess Diana is dead.
How?
Somebody might've got her bumped off.
She was beautiful, after all.
The world's a harsh place for beautiful people.
Ride carefully.
You are also beautiful.
This world…
Is a drunkard returning home
This world…
This world…
It's a forest full of sheep
A forest with a small well
The sheep are wired to jump into the well
The well is wired to drown them
The sheep are wired to jump into the well
The well is wired to drown them
"Women love their 'dash' unconditionally."
Two rupees.
What happened?
-Is everything okay? -Yes.
What's your name?
Shawn.
What do you do?
-What? -What do you do?
-Competition. -Is that so?
My Vivek is doing that as well.
Okay.
I don't have change.
-No problem, you can pay next time. -Fine.
"Women love their 'children' unconditionally."
It's a bit complicated.
Look, here goes…
"Fifty Years of Independence."
"Independence" is a big word. It won't fit.
Shall we write "Aazaadi"?
Aazaadi.
Won't it become an Urdu word?
Our freedom army was called "Aazaad Hind Fauj."
And then the national flag?
Of course.
-You won't mess it up, right? -Yes.
-I'm leaving. -Hold on. Hold on.
Take some pudding.
-Here. -You know I don't like pudding.
You didn't let Vivek come home.
Now, I shouldn't make his favorite pudding either.
Happy birthday to Vivek.
Same to you, Papa-ji.
Here.
Happy birthday.
You must have all seen stars in the night sky.
They appear to be sparkling
because their light is reaching us.
But why don't we see the path of their light?
Has anybody thought about it?
Yes?
Varun, wake up.
-Ma'am. -Yes.
Ma'am, for us to see the light of the stars,
it's important to have a scattering medium.
There is a vacuum in space,
so we cannot see the path of light.
Can you prove it?
Ma'am, I'll have to come there.
Yes, come.
Whoever is sleeping, wake up.
There's light here,
but the path is invisible.
Now, we can see the path
because the dust has created a scattering medium.
Your name?
Ma'am, Sarika Kumari.
What's your favorite subject?
Physics.
I can see that.
Well done!
-Thank you. -Well done.
-One orange juice, please. -It'll take five minutes.
Stop, stop.
-We're taking your cycle. -No, why?
Just for a bit.
You can take our moped to the hostel.
I don't know how to ride it.
Wait here then. We'll buy you a juice.
-We'll be back. -I have to go study.
You sit, we'll be back.
Ride faster.
You made the bet, not me.
Oh, come on!
You lost the race again!
Pineapple juice, please.
And one orange juice.
Dear Lord, you're still here.
You cycled really fast.
I'm Vivek.
I'm Sarika.
I know.
You're in class A3.
-Are you in A3 as well? -Yes.
Have this.
You worked really hard to defeat us.
Want the juice?
I just had it.
"His way of talking was very seductive."
Hi, babe.
Can you hear me?
How do I sound?
I don't know who I am.
Just tell me,
can I…
Can I kiss you?
"My eyes were glued to his face--"
-Hello. -Hello.
Yes. I'm calling from the ration card office.
-Yes? -Is there any lady at home?
-Yes. -Give the phone to her.
There's someone from the ration card office.
-Hello? -Hey, sexy lady.
Excuse me?
What are you doing?
Who is this?
Why do you want to know my name?
But I want to have sex with you.
What nonsense! Give me your name!
Okay, take my name.
-Shawn Michaels. Fine? -What?
Are you out of your mind?
Listen.
Something happened today.
Are you asking me or telling me?
This radio show…
I'm telling you.
A boy comes to the phone booth
and talks dirty on the phone.
He dials random numbers.
Did he misbehave with you as well?
No way.
But…
when I stopped him, he said,
"Stay out of it.
Take the money and zip your mouth."
Let it go.
We can't go to war with every pervert.
What was he talking about?
He says this word a lot.
This word and its synonyms.
We, the citizens of India
We are born equals
Caste, color, creed, and language
Might be different
We, the citizens of India
We are born equals
And here comes the grand cake
of 50 years of Independence.
Our engineer R.K. Singh
has personally got the cake made.
Our beautiful national flag.
With saffron at the top, denoting power,
white, a symbol of peace, in the middle,
and green at the bottom, denoting prosperity.
The most beautiful flag in the world.
Our tricolor.
We bow down to that flag.
Union Telecom Minister, Mr. Kewat Prasad will cut the cake.
Sir…
the flag is printed upside down.
R.K. Singh.
Come onto the stage.
You're needed here.
Mr. R.K. Singh, you cannot hide.
Immediately report to the stage.
He can't get away with this blunder.
Respected Papa.
Dear Papa.
"Respected Papa, I hate it here."
The first mock IIT was around the corner.
And I had no plans.
Except for making new timetables every day.
There is no choice No choice
So much to say But no voice
There is no choice No choice
So much to say But no voice
There is no choice No choice
So much to say But no voice
Classrooms make all the kings
Playgrounds are ugly things
Proverbs like these, mah boy
-Are fermented into cheap liquor -Want a drink?
The brain is a walnut But you eat almonds
And that's why you walk Around like a confused nut
-Good morning, sir. -Yes. Good morning.
-Your cycle has fallen down! -Sorry, sir. I'm getting late.
Repeat after me
There is no choice No choice
So much to say But no voice
There is no choice No choice
There is so much to say But no voice
The future is helluva dark
The future is helluva dark
You stumble and you bend
Alarm clock is your only friend
Rest is the only enemy Common in every loser
The giant career-killer
So, tell me, sir! What do you wanna be when you grow up?
That's the only question All books try to answer
You pick this one or that
You burn this one or that The chorus remains
There is no choice No choice
So much to say But no voice
There is no choice No choice
So much to say But no voice
There is no choice No choice
So much to say But no voice
There is no choice No choice
So much to say But no voice
So this is your first mock IIT.
Focus on your temperament.
Mind full of ice, and a heart full of…
Fire!
Go on.
I felt odd in a classroom like this,
where every kid was a topper.
I was the only topper in my school.
Every year, it was the same old stage, same old crowd,
same old mic,
same old pencil box.
It became boring.
Except for one time.
In the tenth grade, something weird happened on the day of the result.
A paratrooper accidentally landed in our school.
The parachute was so huge it could have engulfed the entire school.
The IIT dream was as massive as that parachute.
It was engulfing us all.
Rank 5026.
Batch downgraded from A3 to B2.
How did you manage such a low rank?
I don't know.
Aren't you studying?
I don't know.
Or were you sick?
I don't know.
Stop repeating "I don't know" all the time.
I am not asking you for the secrets of the Bermuda Triangle.
You're facing an inquiry in the office,
the phone booth is closing, and you're venting at your son.
Let me speak.
What about the phone booth?
Son, the cake was upside down,
and our life got upturned.
Look, Vivek…
Son, look, only you can make it better now.
Work harder for the next round.
Neither did Papa understand my condition,
nor did I understand his.
HUMAN LIMITS
Chasing human capability, I was losing my humanity.
Everything seemed like it was falling apart…
and half of this damned year was still remaining.
You haven't seen me yet,
that's why you're acting pricey.
If you see me, you'll go nuts…
-Who-- -What are you doing here?
You were told to stop this vulgar display, right?
You were told, right?
What's your name?
Shawn… Shawn Michael.
Shawn Michael, right?
What's your real name?
-Mohit. -Mohit.
This boy here,
calls random women from the phone booth
and talks dirty to them.
Whispers the word "sex!"
Sex?
HONC.
Hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon.
Hydrogen makes one bond.
Oxygen makes two bonds.
Nitrogen makes three bonds.
-And carbon makes…? -Four bonds.
Bravo. All of you are in top form today.
If you can learn this much,
then 70 percent organic chemistry will be in your pocket.
-Understood? -Yes, sir.
-Shall we proceed? -Yes, sir.
Okay.
Come on.
Look, Vivek's joining us!
Pedal faster.
Come on.
See you guys at the dam.
-Come on. -I don't know the way.
I know it.
How many are in your family?
Mom, Dad, a younger sister, and me.
And in yours?
Mom, Dad, and just me.
So, you're the only kid!
That sucks.
Why?
Since you're the only kid,
you'll have to fulfill all your parents' dreams.
But there's a solution.
Only if you want to know.
Sure.
Ask your mom and dad…
to make another baby!
What?
-Were you always this liberated? -No. Not really.
I was old-fashioned as a kid.
Your friend Rinku…
Well, our friend.
I used to call him "brother" in school.
Now, it seems funny in hindsight.
Funny? Why?
Well, because he's not my brother.
Just a friend.
Just a "friend"?
Yes, why?
No, I assumed…
What did you assume?
Nothing.
People love assuming.
Uncles expect all girls to behave like sisters.
And boys expect us to behave like girlfriends.
Like friendships don't exist.
Well, you're right.
So, how many friends do you have in Lucknow?
I mean girls.
Girls?
Well, there were… There are some.
Radhika, Shilpa…
Hema, Jaya, Sushma, Nirma…
I came to Kota with high hopes.
When I failed the first time, I thought it was okay.
Everyone, including me, assumed that…
it takes time to settle down here.
I went to a Hindi-language school,
so Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics…
aren't easy for me in English.
In the second year,
when I couldn't crack it, I lied to my family and said
I had jaundice.
And in the third year?
In the third year…
no one even cared to ask.
That's the biggest problem.
When a typical student arrives in Kota,
they are sure of cracking the top rank.
The cocky topper from school!
They walk with the swag of Mohammad Azharuddin,
with an upright shirt collar!
When I came to Kota,
even I thought I would beat everyone's ass down.
But then I saw the madness in the eyes of other kids,
and my brain applied the "limit" function.
As Bundela Madam says,
"What is Calculus?"
"Calculus is the language of change."
The language of change.
When I applied this calculus to my expectations,
my heart groaned,
"Dear God, just don't let me flunk! Any rank will do."
Anyway, chuck it. We're always talking bullshit.
Sarika will have some cool stuff.
Have you guys seen the seashells?
They have these beautiful patterns carved on them.
Do you know how these patterns are made?
Due to the tides in the ocean.
Meaning…
the pattern found on the seashells in the deepest parts of the ocean,
depends on the distance between the Earth and the moon.
People have tried to calculate the moon's distance from the Earth
by measuring these patterns.
Isn't that magical?
So, my hope is…
whether I make it to IIT or not,
I stay connected with Physics
and the world around us.
Vivek, what's your dream?
My dream?
I don't know.
You know,
I never had any friends.
I never went out with friends and chilled like this.
We are not friends,
we are parasites.
He's pouring his heart out,
and you're pulling his leg.
At least you should shut up about matters of heart,
mistaking a girl's friendship for love.
You know shit about the heart.
Yes, but love and friendship are the same thing.
A friendless nerd spouting wisdom after getting drunk?
You guys are my friends now,
so how can I be friendless?
You are too sentimental, bro.
At least I can feel.
Come here, bring your glass.
Everything is pointless.
Just have fun.
Chuck IIT.
Chuck IIT.
Chuck IIT.
Chuck…
Chuck…
Chuck… Chuck IIT.
Don't count too much.
Pick it up.
Hit.
ENTER FOR THE SAKE OF KNOWLEDGE
DEPART FOR THE SAKE OF SERVICE
Cut all three connections of this phone booth.
I didn't expect this crowd at 4:00 a.m.
It happens every day.
Vivek.
Vivek.
That's Vicky. That's Chandan.
Everyone knows Chandan and Rinku.
Darn, the lecture notes on Calculus haven't arrived yet.
-I'll send them soon. -What?
They should reach me in three to four days.
What notes?
Chandan wanted notes for Maths.
It was just a one-day thing.
Who cares about studying?
Anyone wants a smoke?
-Do you have one? -Yes, come.
-See you. -Come on.
-Shawn? -Hello, Aunty!
Here you go.
I washed the sugar off it.
It'll calm you down.
What if he had thrown real acid?
I would've died.
Impossible! I wouldn't let it happen.
Are you Shaktimaan?
Maybe I am.
Let's be sure.
Shaktimaan!
Shaktimaan!
Shaktimaan!
What is it now?
Did you ever think that he'd never be with us again?
From coaching to college,
then a job,
then marriage,
and then his own family.
You sent my son away for good.
That's life, Manju Rani.
This is life…
We all set out of our small towns.
I came from Faizabad, you from Ambala.
We left those places far behind.
Vivek.
This is the train that goes to Lucknow once a week.
And you come here just to watch it depart?
Whenever I miss home,
I come here to watch the trains.
When this year ends,
you'll miss Kota.
This yucktastic place?
What is "yucktastic"?
Yucktastic…
Jinxed.
Cheap.
Pathetic.
Your Lucknow train is leaving.
Jump on it!
Going to Lucknow wasn't that easy.
But I did go to Sarika's hostel that day.
MARIE CURIE GIRLS HOSTEL TALWANDI, KOTA
Come in.
It was a whole new world!
Raghu sir!
You said the inquiry commission members are here.
C'mon, Mr. Singh, don't kill the buzz!
You are my love!
Where is the--
-My heart yearns to meet you! -Where is the big boss?
This is Mr. Krishnan.
He is here from New Delhi
to investigate the cake scandal.
You take two month's leave.
Leave without pay.
Why?
I mean, why should I take leave?
Who's asking you?
Please go.
What's so difficult to understand here?
Is it a small thing?
I've already been sitting jobless for three months.
You guys are eating cashews
and telling me to go on a two-month leave.
The decision is made.
Accept it or not.
It really doesn't matter.
When my son aces the IIT exam,
your face will be worth watching.
Your son flunked high school,
that's why your back is on fire.
All the best.
-Shaurya, do well. -Yes, sir.
-Here you go, 933, great. -All the best.
-Good morning. Best of luck. -Thank you, sir.
Vivek, do well.
By the time the second Mock IIT arrived, everything was in flux.
Chandan was drifting away,
Rinku became distant…
and Sarika got closer.
Your roll number, Vivek?
3028.
It's here.
4344.
You did better than last time.
Chandan, what's your rank?
2802.
Your rank is 2802?
Wow!
You lied about not studying.
Yes, I did.
Rinku…
What's your roll number, Rinku?
I don't want to know the rank.
-What's wrong? -I said I don't care.
Why are you taking out Chandan's anger on me?
I am not.
Go and take Vivek to your hostel.
Feed him cookies and gossip about Rinku being a failure.
Go on.
Why were you studying secretly?
Why didn't you tell Rinku?
Because I prefer Shah Rukh Khan in Darr
over Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa.
Put some more salt.
Enough.
And you used to preach "Chuck IIT."
Then why did you listen to me?
Are you a dumbhead?
We would start at 7:00 a.m.
and walk five kilometers to school.
Have you seen Rinku?
And if we were late, we had to plead…
Reddy, where is Rinku?
Nine, eight,
seven, six,
five, four,
three, two, one!
Wake up, O traveler!
Good morning, Mr. Gupta.
The year has changed, time to change this sweater!
Wake up, buddy!
Let's go to class, Mr. Vivek.
4500… 4600… 4700…
Our savings are almost over.
Just assume…
Assume Vivek doesn't get in.
And we are forced to send him to a private college?
Papa was like the gambler
who knew he would lose.
But he'd keep betting more money.
Do you need money for the emergency light?
Or anything else?
I can't help you if you say nothing.
No matter what he'd say, all I would hear was…
IIT, IIT, IIT…
IIT, IIT, IIT…
IIT, IIT, IIT, IIT…
IIT, IIT, IIT, IIT, IIT…
IIT, IIT, IIT, IIT, IIT, IIT.
Listen.
Has Rinku moved to this hostel?
I don't know.
Chandan wasn't fair.
You can come visit whenever you feel like it.
Your books.
Has the phone booth reopened?
No, the inquiry is still going on.
It'll take a few months more.
But hopefully, your dad will get his job back next month.
Hello, Aunty!
What was that?
What happened, Mummy?
Hello?
Mummy, what happened?
Is everything okay?
What happened?
Nothing, just a car crash out on the street.
Four minutes are almost over, should we hang up?
No, but…
Okay.
I told you not to.
One kilo of sweets in anxiety!
Have some rice.
Come on.
Your damned rice!
What happened?
What does it look like to you?
You roll in the direction people push you.
Are you a man or marble?
You accepted the boss's verdict.
That boy is ruining my life,
and you cannot think beyond this rice.
The only person you can control is Vivek.
Think about it.
The canteen?
Uncle is here.
RAVI KUMAR FOR THE POST OF GENERAL SECRETARY
How long for the snacks?
Pintu, hurry up.
So, what are you studying?
Uncle, B.Sc. from the University.
The same, shadow of the black mamba!
-Uncle, the legendary sweet samosa! -Yeah, okay.
Amazing.
Uncle, but I'm disappointed.
You suffered so much.
You should have asked for help earlier.
Doesn't matter. We'll deal with him.
Well, Ravi, I don't want any kind of violence.
That's why I didn't come earlier.
Uncle, even we don't like violence.
He must be some stupid boy,
unloved as a kid.
Mohit… ball.
Sorry, Uncle.
Endless sorry!
Please hit me if you like.
Kill me.
Hit me.
Why did you bully us every day?
Sucked the lives out of us.
Shall we take him to the cops?
-Police station… -Yes.
No, Papa will kill me.
He'll shoot me dead. Please, not the cops!
Mohit!
We're waiting!
Yes, coming!
Uncle, I'll swallow rat poison.
Please, no police station.
Sorry.
I want to meet your parents.
Uncle, no, not my parents!
I'll never do it again.
Promise.
"Must work very hard for a year."
Did you write this?
No.
It was there before I arrived.
Don't get scared.
I like you.
Didn't we come here to study?
Then study.
I just said what I felt.
No, it's not a dream
Pinch yourself hard or scream
No, it's not a dream
You felt a splash of new sunbeam
And you walked a long walk
Of tears and raindrops
You've smelled the days of love
To feel--
What now?
You were joking, right?
Do you boys grow fungus in your brains?
Sorry.
I like you too.
Uncle, please.
You shouldn't have thrown acid.
How could you stoop so low?
Uncle, it wasn't acid.
It was mineral water.
I am Ravi. Mohit's friend.
Hello, Ravi.
And you?
I'm R.K. Singh.
Divisional Engineer in Telecom,
and I also run a phone booth nearby.
Okay.
Are you an IIT graduate?
Yes.
-Are you from IIT as well? -I saw these certificates and noticed…
Those degrees are mine, but not the certificates.
Those are Mohit's.
Even he's studying at IIT.
Those are Mohit's.
Even he's studying at IIT.
So, the last mock IIT exam is on the 15th of this month.
After that, it's straight to the actual exam!
So, starting now, forget about food, water,
family, and friends. Just focus on your studies.
-Got it? -Yes, ma'am.
Do you guys remember the Zen story about the two monks?
No, ma'am.
Did you forget?
Once upon a time,
two Lamas were walking through a jungle.
Suddenly, a wild bear jumped in front of them.
The bear started chasing them.
Lamas in front, and the bear not far behind.
Soon, the Lamas ran out of breath.
Dire straits.
One Lama said to the other,
"Listen, brother, this is pointless.
The bear is much faster than us.
We cannot outrun it."
The other Lama replied,
"I am not even aiming to outrun the bear."
I've told you the eighth and ninth ranks.
Are you two happy?
The tenth position in your batch goes to
Sarika Kumari.
And in the sixth position is Chandan Rai…
-Chandan Rai. -Chandan, bravo!
The bell is still good.
-Four hundred? -Yes.
Chandan.
Yeah.
Sarika called you and Rinku in the evening
to say goodbyes.
Fine, I'll be there.
Have you seen Rinku?
No, I knocked many times, but he didn't open the door.
Rinku. It's me, Vivek!
Rinku, open the door!
Open the door!
Should I call someone?
I'll push it open.
Rinku…
Hey!
Rinku.
Get up.
Pick him up.
Lift him!
Pick him up.
-Pick him up. -Be careful.
Lay him down on the bed.
Come.
Keep your eyes open.
Move aside!
Rinku, keep your eyes open.
Keep your eyes open.
-Careful. -You'll be okay.
Where does my heart fly?
What oceans does it want to soak?
Wait a while
Write to me, okay?
What's the hurry?
Why didn't you tell me you were unwell?
Son, don't worry.
I'm fine now.
The water supply is erratic,
but I've filled two buckets of water.
Freshen up.
The throat's parched But the water's salty
Food is ready.
You cooked it?
Yes.
It won't be amazing, but won't be too bad either.
Did you forget, this tap's knob is below.
Wait a while
What's the hurry?
Mom was sick.
Dad was unemployed.
And I was entangled in my own doubts.
After learning and forgetting everything
I gained only this much
The heart listens only to its own beats
Wait a while
Foam would remind me of Rinku.
Mom would remind me of sadness.
Papa would remind me of failure.
HUMAN LIMITS
But books would remind me of Sarika.
The ice in the fridge would remind me of Bundela Madam.
Mind full of ice, and the heart full of fire.
It's one o'clock. Get some sleep.
You have to wake up at six in the morning.
Vivek.
IIT is not some magic potion.
Life is so vast.
It has many colors.
Happiness, sorrow, friends…
all of these are bigger than IIT.
You…
Don't worry.
That's all I had to say.
Get your bag ready.
Give him the water bottle!
Vivek, wait.
Admit card. Keep it safe.
Don't forget the chilled water.
Keep a calm head.
-Vivek! -On his way!
-Here, keep everything properly. -Come on already.
Curd. Son, curd!
-No time for good-omen curd. -Good luck.
God bless… Do well.
Go on.
Now it's Vivek's turn.
What do I say?
Anything you want, we all shared our dreams.
e^iπ + 1 = 0
Do you know why this is called
the most elegant equation in mathematics?
Because in this,
an imaginary number
and two universal constants
find a synergy.
Euler said that this equation is proof
that the universe is not random.
It has order…
and control.
The magical thing that we're all chasing.
Rinku, by immersing himself in his guitar.
Chandan, by throwing his weight around.
And Sarika,
for you, focus and control are the same thing.
I thought I should find my control as well.
Difficulty^Imaginary Difficulty + 1 = 0
But I wonder if the variables of my life would fit into any equation.
Whether I'll ever find control?
saying yes to the charming prince, the man you love,
vowing to be loyal and devoted for the rest of your life,
and living happily until the day you die with the man you love…
it's every girl's dream, isn't it?
It's all nonsense!
They hand dolls to little girls the minute they're born,
grooming them for motherhood.
They bring them to weddings in wedding dresses!
What other dream can that girl have besides getting married? Huh? What?
Will she dream about splitting atoms? No chance!
Hold this. The dress is nowhere near done.
And do you know what happens when they are a bit older?
Everyone starts worrying about their marital status.
"When are you getting married?"
"Don't wait too long, honey. Get married." "Be on the lookout."
"Be sure to consider every guy ever."
What's it to you, huh?
Huh? It's none of your business.
Anyway.
And then there's this.
You either get married…
or, you know,
you die alone in an apartment with your 11 cats.
Is there really no alternative?
For instance, can't a woman, of her own free will,
choose not to get married?
How does a man, of his own free will,
decide to get married?
How is that possible?
I keep thinking, but I can't find a single solid reason.
Dude, weren't we making fun of this idiot just the other…
Something's gotten into him.
He looks different. And he… Anyway.
Dude, weren't we making fun of this idiot just the other day because he was married?
-We were, but-- -But what?
You two have been together only a year, and you're having a wedding, Tuna!
What do you think will happen?
Then, after the honeymoon period, which will be over in an instant,
the relationship will become monotonous, you'll pack on 30 pounds, as if you're not plump enough already,
you'll pack on 30 pounds, as if you're not plump enough already, and be at each other's throats!
Marriage means the end of love, excitement, and passion.
What do you expect to happen once you get married?
What makes love so alluring is not knowing how it's going to end.
Plus, the more the woman has to try, the longer she stays in love.
Anticipation is the most important thing to make a love that is long-lasting.
That's why the bird in your hand
doesn't seem as attractive as two birds in the bush.
This, gentlemen, is a shackle.
They even claim
the veins on your left ring finger lead straight to the heart.
But all veins lead to the heart.
A romantic story they concocted just to put men in chains.
And you guys bought it. Bravo.
You look so beautiful.
Be really happy, okay?
LOVE TACTICS 2
How could I have made such a huge mistake?
So, you finally realized?
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to realize.
All right. First of all, stay calm.
The invitations haven't been sent. It's not too late.
-Just give Tuna a call. -Okay.
Tell him you changed your mind but you love him very much.
All right?
What? I haven't changed my mind, Aslı.
You just said you made a huge mistake.
Oh, that?
I scheduled the hair consultation and the cake tasting at the same time.
That's what I meant.
But Tuna's so sweet.
When I told him, he said he'd handle the tasting.
I wish he did the hair rehearsal and we did the cake tasting.
I so need the satisfaction chocolate would give me right now.
You mean it? Is that what we should've done?
You're the bride!
-Let's put these over here. -All right.
And the plates…
Mom, how does it taste?
Delicious!
Should we try the chocolate cake, Mom?
Sure. Let me have some.
Other guys brought their fiancées or their moms.
But you? You brought two dudes.
It's the wedding cake, man. I can't pick one by myself.
The third time is the charm. It looks stunning!
Seriously. I love it. It's gorgeous.
I'm not so sure, girls.
This one's the better one.
Okay. Let's have them combine these two and make something special.
Excuse me? We're finished.
This is the one!
Dude, this is the best cake I've ever had.
Have a taste.
-You mean it? -Try it. Right now.
What are you guys on? Are you two insane?
-Just have a taste. -Shut up!
The disrespect!
I mean it. I know it's the one.
-This is it. -Let's do it.
It'll be amazing.
-Hey. -Right here.
-No. -I'm doing it.
Hello?
Hello? Kerem?
You called just in time.
If you hadn't, I was going to call and ask you to bail me out.
I've started to have disturbing fantasies involving my best friends.
I'm a wreck.
I still have to introduce them to my dancing instructor.
I'm not done here just yet, but I can pick you up when I am.
Please do that. Come right away.
Please hurry up.
We approach each other again.
Now we're away, and we turn.
I missed you.
I missed you too.
How much did you miss me?
If you want, we can find a quieter place and I can show you.
-I'm doing it, right? -Yeah.
Just a bit more…
Look. Use your shoulder and…
Is Tuna having a seizure?
I thought maybe they were poisoned,
but that makes sense too.
Beyoncé. She takes her finger and…
I turn. I'm here. I take her.
I pick her up. Here we go!
-Cansu! -Oh, no.
-I think he's dead! -He went down hard.
-Tuna? -I'm okay. Stay there.
-My legs are just… -Bummer.
It was awful. He went down really hard.
He's so excited that he wouldn't even know if he lost his leg.
All right, I get that most men can't dance.
But this? Come on!
Luckily, your boyfriend can dance.
Oh, you… you took dance lessons.
Just to impress girls.
Such a cliché.
Just one girl.
Damla.
She invited me to prom. I was staying with her family in France.
I didn't want to embarrass her, so I took a few dancing classes.
-Then I really got into it. -You did?
Yeah.
Damla is the daughter of my aunt who raised me, by the way.
It's been a year, yet you still manage to surprise me.
It's been a year, yet I still can't take my eyes off you.
Tell me, Kerem.
Why does everyone think love should lead to marriage?
I seriously don't get it.
Right.
I don't get it either.
All the ceremonies and stuff… As if it's something to write home about.
If you have to do it, just have a small wedding, right?
If you really have to,
just do it with a few close friends on a beach or something.
If you have to.
I think it's so unnecessary.
I didn't know you felt like this about marriage.
Why not?
I'm a confident, strong woman.
Why are you so surprised?
Because you're amazing.
Stop it.
I've been trying to tell this to the girls for the last few days.
Same with me and the boys.
Think about it.
You're married,
and everything you once ached for is now ordinary.
No more love.
No more passion.
And, contrary to popular belief…
Even sex becomes less frequent.
-Of course it does! -It does.
I bet they don't get a chance because of the constant fighting, right?
Right. I bet.
I'm not going to marry you, and that's great.
Again, I don't get it.
You didn't want to get married anyway.
Why are you so upset?
This time I don't get it either.
I understand not wanting to get married,
but not wanting to marry me?
Only I'm allowed to not want that.
Hey, Tuna.
Are you sure your ankle's just sprained?
That's what the doctor said.
How many times do I have to tell you, Kerem?
Do you trust medical science?
So the doctor said your ankle was just sprained
and put that thing on? Interesting.
I bet it's actually broken.
He's scared we'd advise him to postpone the wedding.
I'm such a lucky guy.
You know what? Aslı is the woman of my dreams.
I realized that once again today.
She thinks marriage is ridiculous too. She doesn't want it.
Who do you think you are not wanting to marry me?
Do I want to marry you? I don't. So who cares if you want to or not?
Our king doesn't want to get married!
Well, we'll see about that.
It's been the same thing for an hour. Should we be worried?
I understand not wanting to get married,
but not wanting to marry me?
Only I'm allowed to not want that. Me!
We definitely should be worried.
Who do you think you are, not wanting to marry me?
I'm such a lucky guy.
Aslı…
Aslı got him again.
What are you talking about? I told you how our talk went.
Bro, have you ever heard about a thing called "the biological clock"?
He's right. I say a year, tops.
Aslı's not what you think she is.
I'm telling you, she said it herself. Why is it so difficult to believe?
You know, there's a saying, kiddo.
"Don't believe everything a woman says."
Here. Call yourself a cab.
-"Don't believe everything a woman says." -"Don't believe everything a woman says."
I bet they don't have a chance because of the constant fighting, right?
I'm not going to marry you, and…
Good morning. Welcome, Ms. Aslı.
Hello.
-Can I see this on a mannequin? -Sure, Ms. Aslı.
The game is on again, girls.
The war is on again, guys.
I'm going to convince Kerem to marry me.
I'll destroy every inkling of urge Aslı might have to get married.
Why do you think guys don't want to get married?
Because they're afraid they'll lose their freedom if they do.
Why do women want to get married?
First and foremost, it's their genetic disposition.
While we play with guns and cars,
they try to marry off Barbie and Ken.
I did that as a kid too.
Remind me and we'll revisit your childhood sometime.
They know they'll have to take care of a family financially,
and they don't want that.
It's the responsibility.
You're absolutely right.
Write that down too, Cansu. Put it to the top.
They want to get married to make sure their need for love and attention is met.
See, I never thought about that.
That's obvious. No need to say it.
What are you writing?
First, I'm going to show him that when we get married
he'll have stability in life and that I won't ever limit his freedom.
First, I'm going to show her that when we get married
First, I'm going to show her that when we get married life will be boring and monotonous.
I'll need your help for that.
Anything you need.
-Hey, honey. -Hey, honey.
Do you have any plans for tonight?
No.
My schedule's free. You have something on your mind?
I did, but Emir's making a weird face at me right now.
We have to work on our presentation for a few hours at my place.
Why don't you come? If you won't be bored.
Maybe we'll do something after.
Sure. I'll be there.
All right. See you at 7:00, then.
Okay.
Tonight, ask Aslı for as many things as you can, all right?
Overwhelm her.
This is so much better.
Tonight, I'll show him how I can be a total geisha.
Note that I said how I can be one, not that I am one.
-Honey. -Yeah, baby?
Could you make coffee?
I already have.
But it's Turkish coffee, right?
How about some mırra, man?
-Mırra? What the… -You told us to ask for stuff.
Do you have mırra, babe?
No. I don't have mırra.
-Just Turkish coffee, then. -Yeah.
How do you want it?
-No sugar for me. -A little sugar, please.
Since you just want a little sugar, I guess I want a lot.
Cool.
Black, some sugar, a lot of sugar.
The machine's broken, honey.
You'll have to do it on the stove.
It's the best way to make it anyway. I'll be just a minute.
-Tea, guys? -How about tea?
You read my mind.
I'll go get it.
Hey, honey. No bags, though.
With loose tea, please.
When have I ever used bags, honey?
I was already brewing it. I'll be just a second.
Can you take these as well, honey?
Right! I almost forgot. Thanks.
Just…
Here you go.
I can take those too.
See, I'm skillful. Right?
Dude, she's not acting like herself.
What if she's possessed?
-By what? -What do you think? Don't make me say it.
God forbid. There's no wood here.
You told me the boys were coming, so I left work early, honey.
I made a little something for you.
Thank you so much, Aslı. This is amazing!
Bon appétit.
Did you make these yourself, honey?
Eat up, guys. I'll go get some fruit for you.
She's good.
Thanks for everything.
Send me that recipe.
They're crazy.
I'll find an excuse to go home tonight.
I won't stay at his place anymore.
He'll see that if he wants to sleep beside me,
he'll have to marry me.
It's late.
Okay. Let's go to bed.
I'm working on a new collection, you know.
I have a crucial meeting tomorrow.
It's better if I stay at my place.
Dream about me.
The plan didn't work.
It was as if he knew what I was trying to do.
Does he know what I'm trying to do?
Is it possible someone told him?
What's up?
Did you perhaps tell Cansu about the plan?
I didn't tell him anything. Why won't you believe me?
One of us would be dead by now if Aslı didn't know.
I already swore on it, man!
I didn't tell her.
Will all your names fit on this?
Even our résumés would, honey.
Hey, Daddy. Leyla's asking for you.
Come, my princess.
My baby girl. Come on.
I need to borrow a baby.
Borrow a baby? Like, a live one?
Yes! Two birds with one stone.
I'll show Kerem how good a mother I can be,
and I'll find out if he dreams of being a father at all.
But you don't even like babies.
I didn't say I did.
Who would let you have their baby?
Even my own sister thinks twice before handing her kid to me.
Your sister has a baby.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Thank you so much.
How does 7:00 sound? Would that work for you?
All right.
Aslı?
Here you go.
Care to explain this situation, honey?
Sure. It's Ezgi's sister's baby.
She asked if I could take it for a couple of hours,
and I was like, "Sure thing!"
A couple of hours?
Restless leg syndrome. It does that occasionally.
-Can we talk in my office? -Sure.
You two look so cute.
What are we going to do with it for a couple hours?
Well… I mean, I don't know.
We'll feed it,
change it,
put it to sleep.
Stuff like that.
It's just a baby. How hard can it be?
Kerem, you look so good holding it.
What? I don't even know how to hold it.
Oh wow, you're such a cutie.
I'm not feeling so good.
What could it have eaten for it to smell that bad?
Come on, Aslı. I'm going to pass out.
I can't do it.
I'll show Kerem how good a mother I can be.
Of course I can.
-Come on. -I'll do it.
It's a boy.
-You didn't know? -I didn't.
Hey, guys. You need any help?
Be my guest.
Hold my hair, I'm going to be sick.
Help!
Wait a minute.
Great idea.
It worked out.
I think we can dress him now.
I'm exhausted.
Me too.
I can't have my aunt sit next to my sister-in-law.
They had a huge fight at Mete's circumcision ceremony.
How about this, then?
All my aunts at one table, and my uncle and his wife at another.
No. I can't do that either.
They fought at Kaan's wedding--
Honey!
Do you think seating them at different tables is a solution?
It's not, but what am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do? Kerem's definitely up to something.
Aslı's been acting weird.
-What could it be? -No idea.
It's as if he knows what I'm trying to do.
You're being paranoid, man. What could she be up to?
Maybe she wants to get married and is trying to convince me.
Didn't you tell me she definitely didn't want to marry you
when I told you she got you?
-Yes, I did. -Don't worry, then.
How would he know you changed your mind?
Right. And why would she change her mind anyway?
How would he know?
Anyway, that's not important.
A great opportunity just fell into my lap, girls.
There's no way this plan won't work.
There's no way!
For our next plan, we need an unhappy couple, gentlemen.
Who could that be?
Hey, Tuna.
Have you ever seen Emir's wife?
No. Have you?
Strangely, I haven't either.
He was married when we met him.
There's still no physical evidence.
Have you been fooling us this entire time?
Take a look at the marital status.
-There you go. -Yeah. He's married.
You a sociopath or something?
Do you have her locked up?
Why haven't you introduced us?
I guess I haven't found the opportunity.
For two years?
She doesn't exist.
Don't be ridiculous.
Things are bad between us as it is. I can't deal with you guys too.
-Things aren't good? -Not good at all.
Let me put it this way,
we can't go a minute without arguing.
No. Just no.
No way.
Tuna.
Yes way.
Oh wow! It's a great plan.
Your parents are the best couple I've ever seen in my life.
And they're still madly in love.
So cute.
But don't they live in İzmir?
That's why I said the opportunity just fell into my lap.
They're coming here tonight. I'll introduce them to Kerem.
I haven't seen them in two months anyway.
You're coming to my place tomorrow, Emir. Are we clear?
You should come too, Tuna.
I don't want Aslı to get suspicious.
I'm telling you. We're in a bad place right now. Don't you get it?
I do. That's why I want you to come.
You two will fight where Aslı can see it.
That's all.
What is he talking about?
Listen. You owe me a favor. It's time to repay it.
-I don't owe you anything. -You do.
Hey, honey. I was just going to call you.
Emir and his lovely wife are coming to my place tomorrow night.
Emir insisted we met before the wedding.
Cansu and Tuna are coming too.
How about you invite Ezgi so we can all be…
What? Your parents?
Tonight?
No, honey. I'm not stuttering. Why would I stutter? But…
But… I have something really important tonight.
Of course it's not more important than meeting your parents, honey.
All right.
Okay.
I'm sorry, brother.
The ring is loading, bro.
Don't loosen your tie, honey.
You know I hate ties.
Why are you so adamant about it?
You're meeting my parents.
We wouldn't want my dad to think his girl's dating a hobo, right?
So if I don't wear a tie, I'm a hobo?
-You nervous or something? -I'm not. I'm perfectly chill.
Are you nervous?
No, I'm not nervous at all.
Don't be scared.
I'm not scared!
My dad might be very strict and disciplined,
but he's a good person.
Also, they're still madly in love with each other.
I've not once seen them fight. That's how much they love each other.
You'll see in a bit.
They're here.
Honey?
Are you nervous?
You are nervous.
They're here.
Come, honey. Don't be shy. Come on.
-Mommy. -Hey, baby.
-Welcome. -Thanks.
I've missed you so much.
I'll introduce you. Kerem, my mother, Canan.
-Hello. It's so nice to meet you. -Hi, dear. You too.
-Yeah… -Where's Dad?
He's coming.
Mr. Servet?
No hugs for your papa?
Papa?
Oh, my baby doll.
-What's up? -Dad?
Kerem, right?
Welcome, Mr. Ercüment.
"Mister? I hate that stuff. Just call me Ercü.
Are you a banker?
Is he a banker?
-Your mom said he was in advertising. -I am.
So what's with the suit?
I… I had a meeting.
The meeting's over, son. Hold this.
Let's get that tie off.
Just chill. Relax. There you go.
It's a long tie, isn't it? Come on now.
-How tall are you, dude? -"Dude"?
-I'm 6'3". -Just an inch taller than me, huh?
Mom, what happened to Dad?
Andropause, dear.
What?
He's totally lost it.
Today?
No way. You're taller than me? I bet you're not.
-I'm not. -Yeah.
-We're about the same, but-- -Because I'm 6'2".
-Listen. -Yes?
How about a selfie?
-Sure. -Come on.
I swear I'm going to pass out.
Hold this. Hold it.
You have any drinks?
Sure, but how about we have dinner first?
Look, honey.
It's been months.
I can't stand him unless I drink, okay?
Got it?
-I look amazing, you don't look so good. -So just forget about dinner.
Follow me on Instagram?
Dad has an Instagram account?
Sure he does. He even bought fake followers.
What?
Forget about it. Just get me a drink, honey.
-Something strong. -I'm going to be sick.
You like my profile?
-It's lit, right? -Yeah.
It looks amazing, Mr. Ercüment.
But we agreed on Ercü.
All right, then. Mr. Ercü… I mean, Ercü.
Go ahead. Pour me another one.
Tell me, Mom,
how did Dad turn into that guy all of a sudden?
How? Please tell me.
I'll tell you.
First, he gradually started changing his wardrobe.
It made me a little uneasy, but I didn't push him.
Then he changed his car.
Yeah.
He bought a convertible.
You just have to see it, Aslı.
He looks so out of place in it.
You saw the motorcycle.
And then his mannerisms, his demeanor,
his way of talking…
He just transformed.
What do you think of my triceps?
Oh wow. Looks amazing for your age.
Excuse me?
-It looks amazing. -Sure. You on the keto diet?
I'm not a keto guy.
Keto's a must. Or else be out of shape.
-I'm not sure. -Yeah.
Just take me as an example.
You're right.
You're not bad yourself. Show me.
-I'd rather not. -I showed you.
-But, Mr. Ercüment… Mr. Ercü… Ercü-- -Please.
-I'd rather not. -Come on.
Kerem! Kerem!
I want a divorce.
For real?
We'll go on a trip. I have a bike.
-I'll be waiting. Good luck. -Sure, Ms. Aslı. Thanks.
Huh? Why are you still here? We'll see each other tonight anyway.
I'm trying to finish the collection.
Between your wedding and my game, I've been slacking.
We have a big surprise for you.
What's that?
You'll see in a minute.
-Hey, ladies. -Here he is!
Wow! Bulut?
Wow! How?
Where did you come from?
Oh, you girls.
-I missed you so much. -Welcome.
Thanks.
You haven't changed a bit.
Well, you look even more beautiful.
Thank you so much.
-I missed you a lot. -Oh you. We missed you too.
I had no hope when I invited you.
I'm so glad you showed up.
My beautiful-hearted friend is getting married. Of course I showed up.
-He's talking about me. -Yeah, he is.
You know what? The office is pretty slick.
You finally had the guts to build your own brand, huh?
It was about time.
-Congratulations. -Thanks.
Hey, Aslı.
Those look gorgeous.
That really feels good
coming from the owner of a world-famous brand.
I hope you didn't say it just to make me happy.
You know how I am about work.
I didn't say it just to make you happy.
We have a lot to talk about. Take a seat.
Let's have drinks.
Tell us. How are things going with you?
Exhausting. Six months in Dubai, six months in New York.
And a few trips in between.
Poor you. You have such a tough life.
Tell me about it. I'm about to cry.
Let's have dinner.
I'll tell you all about how tough my life is.
We actually have plans tonight, Mr. Bulut.
-We're having dinner at Kerem's. -Kerem?
My boyfriend.
-You have a boyfriend? -I do.
And his name's Kerem?
Come on, people. You must've had a laugh about it.
Literally no one lets it slide.
Wow. So someone finally has the honor of becoming your boyfriend, huh?
Now I really want to meet this Kerem.
It wasn't all easy, you know.
I can imagine.
Stop it, Bulut!
If he doesn't bring his wife this time, I'll drive him crazy at work.
-Dude, his wife doesn't exist. -Kerem!
Welcome.
Who's that? We have a strange lion on our savanna.
I don't know him.
-Hey, honey. -Hey, baby.
Let me introduce you two.
Bulut is my childhood friend. He flew in from Dubai for the wedding.
-Welcome. I'm Kerem. -Thanks.
Sorry about showing up uninvited.
-No worries. Don't mention it. -Thanks.
I still can't believe it. You're here!
-Shall we? -Sure. Come on.
Why is she all giddy? Jeez…
How?
Has she been Photoshopped next to Emir?
Hey, guys. This is my wife, Feride.
Welcome. I'm Kerem.
-Nice to meet you. -You too.
"Feride"?
How is her name Feride?
She's more like a Bella, a Kendall, or a Gigi.
Nice to meet you.
-You too. -You thrice.
Is that you Feride?
-Aslı! -How?
-What the… -What are you doing here?
Is that really your wife? She's not from the agency?
-I'll kill you. What the hell? -He has a point. We'll talk later.
It's been so long.
-Yeah. And I got married. -To who?
-To Emir? -Yeah.
-Bulut? -Feride?
-What's up? -Who's that?
-Kerem? -Emir?
-Tuna? -This doesn't concern us, baby.
This is such a coincidence.
Feride and I are high school friends.
We haven't seen each other in years.
That's amazing. So interesting. Who's this guy, then?
-Who? -The guy right there.
He looks like a Greek statue. Like Adonis. Who is he, man?
Oh, Bulut? He's just--
Bulut and I dated briefly in high school.
You dated this guy?
Shall we sit?
I'll meet the girls.
-He's having a stroke. -Just let him drop.
You hungry, Feride?
No, she's not hungry.
My jaw locked up.
Dude, are you okay?
Want us to beat him up?
It's unreal, really.
The mysterious wife of my boyfriend's best friend
is my childhood friend.
Now we're here together after so many years.
Emir did mention an Aslı a lot,
but I never would've imagined it was you.
Let's drink to us meeting again, then.
Cheers!
By the way, why did you tell Emir we dated in high school?
I mean, it lasted about a week. I didn't even hold your hand.
Your husband had a heart attack.
Things have been rocky between Emir and I. We're always fighting.
I wanted him to be jealous.
Nice tactic. Very nice.
What are we doing tomorrow?
We're having a nice chat here, honey.
I've got everything under control.
What's tomorrow?
Cansu's bachelorette party. I'm organizing it.
But what's the plan?
Where are we going?
I keep asking, but all you say is "I got it."
We'll figure it out, honey. It's not like there are a million venues.
We'll pick one and have fun.
So we're going to be doing what everyone's doing.
-Is that it? -Yeah. What else there is to do?
Shame on you, Aslı. Seriously.
Wedding preparations and bachelorette parties
don't mean anything to you.
We get it.
We respect it too.
But you know how important this is to Cansu.
You're not showing her the same respect.
Do you realize how condescending you've been about this wedding?
I'm just letting you know, Cansu was expecting something special
and for you to put at least a bit of thought into it.
Yeah. You're right.
She's so right.
What am I going to do? I have to go. I'm leaving!
-I have to go! -Stop! What are you doing? Come here.
-I'm leaving! -Where are you going?
I can't leave. I'm in the middle of the ocean.
What am I going to do?
I'm not prepared for this.
-Calm down. We'll figure it out. -We can't. We won't figure it out.
Just calm down.
I have an idea, but I'm not sure if you'll like it.
-Let's go to my island. -Your…
-You have an island? -Yeah.
And there's a hotel on it.
-What? -You have a hotel?
You're the best!
Unbelievable! He has an island.
Guys, we have an island. Let's make a list.
Let's think of some plans.
What kind of party? Who should we invite?
-Okay. -Cansu's friends…
Man, you have an island. This is unreal!
What's up with you two?
-Kerem doesn't know, does he? -He doesn't.
What? The girls' island party?
Look how relaxed he is. Look at him!
Dude, I had tons of meetings today.
Go ahead and ask me if I remember anything.
-Do you? -No, I don't.
Ask me why I don't remember.
Why don't…
-Say something, Tuna. -Why don't you remember?
What is this, a Q&A session? Just tell us, for God's sake.
Because the guy is my wife's ex-boyfriend, man.
As if that's not enough, he's even hotter than Kerem!
Is he really?
Get it together, guys.
-First of all, he's not hotter than me. -I think he is.
Second of all, it was years ago, man.
-Don't you trust your wife? -Of course I do, but…
So?
And last but not least,
how did you manage to marry a woman like that?
Seriously. How did that even happen?
You know when they say a guy is dating way out of his league?
He is that guy.
What's your secret?
Sure, go ahead, joke all you want.
I'm serious, man.
Clearly we have a lot to learn from you.
And why are you getting jealous about Bulut?
Let Kerem worry about him.
-Huh? -What?
-No. -"No" what?
As in "No, I don't need anything." I have snacks and…
What did you say?
-What did I say? -Come on, Tuna! Spill it.
All right, man.
Bulut was actually…
in love with Aslı.
But Aslı didn't indulge him,
so he and Feride…
You know the rest.
Cansu told me.
I think the previous outfit looked a lot better.
It's a bachelorette party. You should wear white.
You think so?
All right. Let's all wear white, then.
-Yeah? -Sure.
I still can't believe it, Aslı.
I mean, I knew you'd surprise me,
but I didn't expect this.
Thank you so much.
-Actually, I-- -You know what?
You're a queen.
-The screaming thing is new! -She scared me.
I know, but I can't help it. I'm so happy.
Come here. I'm so lucky to have you two.
You startled us.
So?
What should we do?
Maybe order food? I'm hungry.
-You seem a bit upset about it. -No.
I trust her. Also…
I mean…
You said it yourselves, Aslı rejected him years ago.
-Nothing to worry about. -Fine.
All right. Your call.
Let the girls stay on a remote island by themselves
with the handsome, rich guy who leads a life of luxury in Dubai.
I'm fine with that.
Life of luxury? Come on.
It's not like he's the sheikh of Dubai.
Right. He's not the sheikh.
He's just his closest friend and also his business partner.
Look at it. Such luxury!
-Show me. -Here.
Wow! He has a tiger, dude.
A live one.
-Welcome. -This is so romantic!
Welcome.
I couldn't sleep all night!
I didn't get any sleep either.
I kept watching Feride.
At one point she opened her eyes and saw me. She was terrified.
I drove her to the airport, and she couldn't even say goodbye.
Poor girl.
We stopping in Susurluk?
For sandwiches.
I'm not even going to answer that.
Let the fun begin!
So? Is that the island?
His island?
Yeah.
We already asked around. Now we have to wait for his permission.
I'll ask the question on everyone's mind, then.
How are we going to get there?
Once we get his permission to go,
we'll just rent one of these.
This one would work. Let's get something fancy.
Let's go over what we discussed, guys.
We absolutely did not follow the girls here.
Are we clear on that?
Actually, we were clear on it the eighth time you told us,
but now that it's the ninth time, I'm a bit confused.
Can you repeat it, please?
The girls won't buy it. Especially Aslı.
Let's just stick to the plan.
We work in advertising, right? Just sell the idea.
We're here because of you anyway.
Me? What does it have to do with me?
You called us last night.
I just wanted to keep the game going, man.
Yeah, right, the game. Sure, buddy.
-Yeah, the game. -Right.
I'm so excited about the party tonight.
I'm sure it'll be awesome.
Girls?
You only see a mirage in the desert, right?
Who's Mirage?
Wow! The guys on that fishing boat really look like Tuna, Emir, and Kerem.
Right?
Let me ask you something.
Did it ever cross your mind that it could be actually them?
Makes more sense than them being look-alikes.
-Yes, it did. -I'm glad to hear that.
They actually followed us to the party.
They're here.
Just like we discussed.
The fisherman prince!
Baby, I came for you.
And I came for you, honey.
Oh honey. I'm glad you're here. I've missed you.
Idiots.
-Sweetheart. -Welcome.
Thanks.
We were already in Marmaris for Tuna's bachelor party,
so we thought we'd surprise you.
How are things?
-I'm sure that's true. -I told you she wouldn't buy it.
I swear I'm going to break one of your legs, man.
And the fishing boat?
Was it planned, or…
-Isn't it neat, though? -So cool.
Welcome, guys. What a nice surprise.
-Thanks. How are you? -I'm okay. You? Thanks.
Unbutton a few for me. What's the big deal?
There's a party tonight.
Since you came all this way, how about you join us?
I mean… Maybe. Right?
Right. Maybe.
Sure. I'd like that.
Let's go, then.
Let's get some drinks.
So this is it.
It's perfect.
You're unbelievable, Aslı. The place looks fabulous.
-Are you ready for the real surprise? -What?
-Cansu! -We're here!
-Cansu! -Cansu!
I guess that's how they communicate.
You're just here because they insisted, huh?
Yeah.
All right.
If you say so.
We need to talk.
I'll be right back.
Are you drunk?
This stuff hits you hard, doesn't it?
Not at all.
I heard something that'll blow your mind.
You know, Aslı is…
You know, Kerem is…
She's trying to coax you into marriage this time around.
He's trying to discourage you from getting married.
Tuna told me.
Cansu told me.
I knew it. I knew he was acting weird.
So that's why she's been acting weird.
You didn't tell Tuna anything, right?
Is it possible
that you told Cansu about our plans?
I didn't, Aslı.
Shame on you, Kerem.
Cansu…
How could you even think that?
I'm actually angry at you.
You're determined not to marry me, huh? Is that so, Mr. Kerem?
You're trying to marry me, huh? Is that so, Ms. Aslı?
I'll see you at our wedding.
In your dreams.
Bring it on.
You think we can do it?
Follow my lead.
Tango is a dance where the man leads.
I read that it actually depicts
the woman running away from the traps laid by the man.
It's a good thing we're honest with each other.
No more games, right?
You tell me.
Why would I need to play games with you?
If you say so.
What about you?
What reason could I possibly have to play games with you?
Right. There's no reason.
I think we're perfect for each other.
I agree.
We've had complaints.
They can hear you all the way in Greece.
It's our friend's bachelorette party. We're really sorry.
Well, in that case, let the party begin.
Morning.
Good morning.
Is it morning already?
The sun's been up for a while.
Come on.
Where are we going?
There's only one thing to do this early.
No way. A balloon ride?
It's a surprise.
-Kerem. -Yeah?
Even though I was scared, everything was amazing.
Let's stop while we're ahead.
We can't keep riding balloons.
Stay calm and trust me.
And take one of these.
-Come on, Kerem. -Take it.
Look. If you're thinking about
stuff like paragliding or bungee jumping, I swear I'll die.
I'm not even threatening you. Just… I'll be so scared I'll just up and die.
It'll be amazing. Trust me.
Damn it. Here we go again.
There's a step ahead. Be careful.
There you go.
Wait here.
-Are we there? -Yeah.
How dare you think I'd take you paragliding or bungee jumping?
I never imagined this would be the surprise.
The view will be beautiful.
Are you ready, Ms. Aslı?
Hey, Kerem. Can I ask you something?
Why won't you ever surprise me on land?
Maybe I want to sweep you off your feet.
Are you ready, lovebirds?
We are, captain.
I was relieved when I saw the seaplane, but the pills were a great idea.
Welcome. I'm your pilot. I'm Yavuz.
-I'm Kerem. -Hi. I'm Aslı. Nice to meet you.
Kerem and Aslı, huh?
Welcome.
Are you nervous?
-I'm so nervous. -Me too, actually. It's my first time.
-Your first? -Yes, my first flight.
Getting qualified took me a long time.
Is that so?
-Can I have my hand back? -No way.
Let my hand go. Let go!
-No way. Please. -Just let go!
Hey, man. You…
Honey! Is it okay to take two of those?
Just be glad I didn't swallow the entire bottle.
He's a failure. He can't even get qualified.
-I'm out. -No! Ms. Aslı!
-Honey, stop! -Wait, ma'am.
-I won't do it. -I got qualified two days ago.
-Stop lying. -He's qualified, honey.
I can't do my first flight without you.
-So… please. -Just don't, then.
-Please. Come on. -No!
-It's so windy! -The weather's nice.
We'll see the bays.
-Let's just not fly today, please. -Come on, honey.
Oh, you.
Now I'm panicking too, after seeing your reaction.
What did he say?
Captain.
Mr. Captain!
Hey, Aslı.
You okay, honey?
I'm great.
Like, I'm aware of everything,
but I don't feel anything.
Can I please have one of those pills?
Just between us, I get panic attacks.
I hope this helps.
What are you doing?
He's incompetent and has panic attacks!
How did you even become a pilot? Keep your eyes forward!
Why? Is there traffic ahead?
We're about to die.
Oh, no.
"Oh, no"?
Captain? Captain!
-Captain! -Hey, honey.
Honey, this has been such a big surprise, really.
Congratulations.
Wake up, captain!
Mr. Pilot, get up.
The control lever.
Honey, help me lift him. I need to sit there.
"The control lever"?
He's talking as if he's a veteran pilot.
"The control lever."
That's great. Now he'll never wake up.
You know how to fly a plane?
Of course I don't!
Fine, but why are you yelling?
Mayday! Hey, control tower!
-Air traffic control. -The pilot passed out.
My name is Kerem. I don't know how to fly the plane.
Mayday!
Hold on tight, Aslı.
Hey, tower! Can anyone hear me?
Hey, Aslı.
I love you so much.
Aw! I love you too.
Silly you!
I wish we'd gotten married.
I regret every second I've spent without you by my side.
Me too.
I have a confession to make.
I've been trying to change your mind on marriage for days.
Really?
I already knew! Cansu told me everything.
And I've been trying to coax you into it through deception, plots, and strategy.
Damn you, Tuna.
But I did tell you, honey,
we're just perfect for each other.
Awesome!
We're safe, Aslı!
We don't know that.
My hero.
You managed to fly the plane,
but do you know how to land it?
You're so silly.
Mayday! You there, tower?
-Are we there yet? -No.
Go back to sleep. I'll wake you up.
Come here, you!
Fly the damn plane!
You guys!
We make such a great family.
It was a nightmare.
It could have been much worse.
If he hadn't woken up,
I swear you would've been fish food.
I've never been so scared.
But…
you know what was weird?
I wasn't scared for myself,
I was only scared for Aslı.
I swear.
So many awful scenarios crossed my mind.
"What will I do if something happens to her?" "How will I live?"
You know what I realized?
How much I loved her.
How I don't want to be without her.
Even for a second.
It's coming. I swear it's coming.
I think I want to marry Aslı.
I'll have to live in Dubai for six months if I accept your offer?
Yeah.
I know this is a huge decision, Aslı,
but it's also a great opportunity.
So I really want you to think about it.
But you're thinking about Kerem right now, aren't you?
The Aslı I know wouldn't pass up an opportunity like this otherwise.
The last one.
Look how tidy everything is.
He's definitely husband material.
If only you were single, Kerem…
Wait. He is unmarried.
Honey, I still can't believe we're going to be living here in a week.
Me neither. I'm so excited!
-No, I'm more excited. -No, I'm more excited.
-No, I'm excited. -No, I am.
The things I'm going to do to you…
What, dude? She's my wife.
How about we go check out the rooms, honey?
Don't be ridiculous. Not before marriage.
Right.
We're just gonna go check the other rooms.
I said that to fool them.
-Aslı. -Kerem.
Go ahead.
Come on.
Bulut made me a job offer.
They'll invest in my brand.
I'll also create a collection for their brand.
That's great news!
I'm so happy for you.
I just knew you'd be very successful.
This is just the beginning.
I'll have to move to Dubai for six months.
Six months?
-Kerem? -Want to come by tonight?
-Sure. I will. -All right.
Be there at 8:00.
Don't be late.
Hey, Kerem.
You sound a bit weird. Something wrong?
No.
I've missed you.
-Welcome. -Thanks.
Come in.
A romantic dinner, huh?
I don't know. Maybe there's more to it.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
I kept thinking all day.
About what?
The moment I fell in love with you.
Was it the first time I saw you?
The first time we talked?
Or…
Or when I saw the innocent girl hiding behind the tough act?
Did you figure it out?
No.
I couldn't.
Because I couldn't remember a moment when I wasn't in love with you.
As if you were always there.
But…
I managed to remember the moment I realized I couldn't be without you.
Come.
That night, right here.
When I touched the keys of this piano for the first time,
you touched my heart, Aslı.
Kerem…
Aslı.
What are you doing?
Will you marry me?
No.
I thought you wanted to marry me.
And I thought you didn't.
I know why you're doing all this.
So I'll reject the offer and not go to Dubai, right?
-No. -Yes.
No.
The timing might make you think that, but no.
Weren't you developing tactics to make me hate marriage?
You were. What changed?
Nothing changed. You don't have to explain.
Just remember.
Remember what I told you when I thought we'd die?
See? You only said it because you thought we'd die.
No! That made me realize it, but it's not why I said those things.
Look, Aslı. I know what I want.
There's no doubt in my mind.
It doesn't have anything to do with Dubai, the job offer, or anything.
It's only you, Aslı.
Well…
What about all the things we said about marriage?
I can't promise you eternal happiness,
but I can promise you I'll do my best to make you happy.
I do promise you that, Aslı.
What if we end up hating each other?
End up at each other's throat inside a courthouse?
I'll take the chance.
I won't allow a signature to come between us.
That's what I'm saying. Why sign at all, then?
I'm already yours.
I don't want you to be mine.
I want to be yours, Aslı.
I'm scared, Kerem.
I'm scared too. I'm terrified, even.
But isn't that good?
That we are still brave enough to want it
even though we're terrified of it.
It all depends on us.
I know it's such a cliché…
but I want to go to bed with you every night
and wake up next to you every morning.
Me too.
Aslı…
will you marry me?
Yes.
-I love you so much. -I love you so much.
Bravo!
I do!
I do!
Bravo!
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You're all wondering if I went to Dubai, aren't you?
Of course I did.
Because our marriage doesn't include hurting, limiting, or manipulating each other.
And it won't, ever.
What we'll live through and how we'll do it are up to us.
Kerem visits me every chance he gets.
Our relationship is even more exciting and passionate than before.
We received exciting news a few days ago.
Emir is going to be a dad!
He prays their daughter turns out looking like her mom.
If it's a girl, that is.
Tuna and Cansu got married a few weeks before we did.
They're very happy.
And Ezgi found her happiness at our wedding.
We're preparing for her wedding now.
Like I said, it's all up to us.
And I hope…
Okay.
Sir.
What?
Sir Rustin, you have a visitor.
Hi, best friend.
Who are you, young lady?
Bro, this is for my godchild.
Nice.
Thanks.
What was that?
Loosen up a little bit.
You asshole.
Guys, let's go. It's ready. Let's go.
Okay. I'll catch up in a bit.
You say I'm careless, I say I'm free
You think I'm worthless, you don't know me
So many things to prove
Do I really have to be understood?
'Cause when you're old, when you're gray
How do you measure life anyway?
Let me be stupid
Let me be wrong
Let me choose the words to my song
Can't find yourself Without getting lost first
So bring all the dead ends and the turns
Let me be stupid
And let me be wrong
I can't feel my face, bro.
So bring all the dead ends and the turns
Diego, happy birthday, bro.
Until next time.
Thanks.
Happy 40th, bro.
Thanks.
Forty years old.
I'm prepared to die.
You're crazy.
Stop talking like that, bro.
I'm just saying that I'm all good.
I feel complete.
I have a complete family.
I have a band.
How about you guys?
How 'bout you?
What if we all died tomorrow?
Aren't you ready?
Why are you so serious?
I was just asking.
-That's so deep. -I was just curious, men.
People who aren't ready to die
have unfulfilled lives.
Let's just take shots.
Shot.
Let's take these shots.
Diego.
Bro, wake up. Bro, wake up.
Diego isn't moving.
Wake Rustin up.
Bro. Diego, wake up.
Rustin. Bro. Rustin.
It's Diego!
How do I do this?
-Diego. -Please call April.
Diego.
Bro, wake up! Bro!
Bro, Diego…
Sir, confirmed. He is the general's son.
Okay, later. We need to head back.
Okay, thanks.
It's all settled.
Rustin.
How many more times will you embarrass me like this?
Aren't you gonna say something?
Sorry, Dad.
Apologies are useless if you repeat the same patterns.
You've got to shape up, son.
Do you want the fate of your friend to happen to you as well?
Give him a little respect.
The guy's already dead.
NOT YET READY.
I'M GONNA MISS YOU!
HUG MOM FOR ME.
People who aren't ready to die
have unfulfilled lives.
Tourist?
Nope.
Not really.
So, is it your first time here in Rotterdam?
Nope.
I used to work and live here… years back.
Welcome back.
You missed this place?
Yes.
We're here.
All right. Thanks.
I promise I'll never leave you
That's my favorite song.
Promise…
I promise that from now on
The two of us will be together
Sheena.
Huh?
Will you please marry me?
Please.
-Yes. -Yes!
Yes.
Thank you!
I'll be at Rachelle's place.
Wow. Come on.
You're gonna tell your sister again?
-Why is this her business? -What do you plan to do with your life?
Just play in a band and do drugs?
Is that it?
Don't belittle my music. Okay?
The real problem here is that you don't have long term plans.
Your life lacks direction. That's why you're like that.
What do you want to happen? What do you want?
Rustin?
Shit. I'll get back to that later, okay?
You said…
-Next time. -You said that last night. Love you.
Okay.
Let me help you with that, sir.
All right.
There you go.
He looks cute.
Hey.
-Pinoy! -Pinoy!
Oh my God. Thank you so much.
Yes, I need your muscles, my countryman.
Thank you.
I'm Bok.
Bok?
You can also call me Bridget if that's easier to remember.
Bridget is fine.
Let's stick with Bok, bro.
Sure. Let's stick with Bok.
Okay.
Clyde.
Clyde, wow.
Handsome name.
It fits this place.
The sun is gone again, right?
You know how the weather is around here.
-Beauty? -Sometimes it rains suddenly.
That's true. It's crazy.
Come. Let's go inside.
-Beauty? -Yes, Yumi?
I'm hungry, Beauty.
This is Yumi. She's my niece.
She calls you Beauty?
She's confused about what to call me.
That's why I told her to call me Beauty,
'cause it really fits me and it's short and simple.
Right.
Beauty, you're talking to a stranger. That's not being careful.
He's not a stranger. He's a friend.
He's our countryman.
He's Uncle Clyde.
Hi, Yumi.
Say hi.
My niece is acting shy.
Come. Let's go inside.
Let's go inside.
Come, Clyde. Let's eat snacks inside.
Come.
Don't mind me. I'm all good.
Don't be shy.
Let's go inside.
It's just me and Yumi here at the house. Come.
Come inside. That's heavy.
Faster.
Fine.
Fine. Thank you again.
Oh, just put it over there.
Really? Ginger tea?
In the Philippines, they drink this to improve their voice.
Is that so?
Doesn't it taste awful?
I knew it.
What did I tell you?
Endure it for beauty.
Yumi.
Where's your mommy?
Is she joining us? Is she coming home soon?
She's at work.
But my real mommy and daddy are both in heaven.
They're now my angels.
Car accident, exactly three years ago.
Rachelle stepped in as her stepmom when Yumi's real mom passed away.
She's far away at the moment. She's at a convention in New York.
Okay, nice.
I know what you're thinking.
The child looks really Filipino.
That's not her real dad.
Yumi, can you get my phone, please?
I just need to check something.
Say the magic word.
Please.
Okay!
Yumi's real daddy is a Filipino.
An addict. Asshole. Good for nothing.
Actually, when the divorce happened, he never really showed up.
He suddenly disappeared.
He left them.
Good thing Sheena never got back with him.
It's a good thing,
'cause she finally found the right man for her.
Sadly, they both died.
Sometimes life is tragic.
I'm sorry.
Am I boring you?
Am I oversharing? I'm sorry.
No. Not at all.
Okay.
Is Yumi asking about her real dad?
There seems to be no point in introducing her to him.
Here's your phone, Beauty.
Thank you.
More ginger tea? No more?
-No. -Okay.
All right!
Yeah!
Well, I'm feeling so confused
A game without a golden rule
You were just
You were just
You were just looking at a child
Feeling so alone
You were just looking at a child
Feeling so alone
Thank you very much.
If someone wants to join us for a little jam or something,
come on stage.
You're welcome.
I'll join.
Okay.
Yeah, I've been waiting
To see your face
I can't get enough
Hi.
I'm Jack.
Hey, I have also another band, and our singer is moving away, so…
Would that be something you would be interested for?
Do you wanna join our band?
-Yeah, sure, man. -Just give me a call if you're interested.
All right. Thanks.
I just need you to babysit for four hours.
Yeah.
You know Yumi. She's not a difficult kid.
Okay, fine.
Can you recommend someone? Someone…
Someone that I know?
Someone that you know, that I can trust?
Okay. All right, please call me.
All right. Thank you.
Did you miss me already, Handsome?
Bok, I brought some chocolates.
I thought about Yumi.
She might like it.
That's so sweet. I'm envious.
Give it to Yumi yourself, okay? Come. Let's go inside.
Bok, I just overheard that you need a babysitter for Yumi?
-Yes. -I can do it.
Let me think.
I just met you yesterday.
That's irrelevant. You can trust me. I'm the general's son.
So what? It's actually worse that you're the general's son.
If you do bad things to my niece, you'll get away with it easily.
Come on. I'm harmless, Bok.
Wait a sec.
Why do you want to take care of her?
Why do you want to babysit?
Do you know anything about children?
And yes, this is a Q&A portion.
I have nieces and…
Bok, I need a side hustle.
It'll only take a few hours, right?
Come on.
Okay. They messaged me. Okay. Come.
Yes!
Yumi, if something goes wrong,
what will you do?
Call Beauty.
Very good.
Okay. If you can't get to the phone,
what do you do?
Run outside the streets and scream…
Help!
Okay, that's enough. Handsome might hear you.
Okay. If you can't get out,
what will you do?
Hide in my secret place.
Good job, niece.
Okay, all right.
Handsome, it's settled. Come here.
Okay, I better get going. You're in charge now.
I'm leaving.
Okay. Bye-bye.
I love you.
I love you, my niece.
Okay. Take care.
There are 18 apples in six bags.
And two apples are left over.
Then divide it by six, you get three,
with remainder two.
Three apples each. Eighteen.
Need help?
No, thank you.
Okay. I'm done. Can we play now, please?
Yeah. Sure.
Follow the steps, Uncle.
Not like that.
You're dead.
Stop!
Uncle Clyde, stop!
Yumi, it's just a game.
Don't kill it!
Yumi, can we do something else?
Don't kill!
Stop killing!
Uncle, why did you stop it?
Yumi.
Uncle Clyde, you're awake.
I'm sorry, I ate your chocolates.
No, it's okay. You can have them.
Yumi, do you want Uncle Clyde to build you a rocket ship?
You can do that?
Of course.
Really?
Yeah.
Perfect. Good job.
Set it up.
I'll hold it.
Can it start?
They're safe inside. They're ready to launch.
I am a superhero.
Time to launch!
Yumi farted.
Five, four, three, two, and one.
Where are we?
Where are we?
Uncle Clyde, wanna take a picture?
-Say… -Stars! Stars!
Yumi is gone. Where's my niece?
What the heck is going on?
-You're just out here. -Beauty, we're here.
I thought you already kidnapped my niece.
I was looking for both of you indoors.
That's crazy, Bok.
Beauty, look.
Uncle Clyde made this for me.
In fair… You made this?
-Is it nice? -Fairness, huh?
You know the best way to eat this?
Use your hand like this.
I like that also.
Winner, right?
I agree.
-Delicious. -Oh my.
-Bok. -Yes?
Yes, Rachelle?
How are you and Yumi?
We're okay.
Mommy.
Yumi, I miss you so much, baby.
I miss you, Mommy.
I have a new friend!
He's Uncle Clyde.
-He's here. -Hello.
-No, don't bark. You're not a dog. -Is he Beauty's friend?
New-found friend.
Or he might be my future boyfriend.
I'm just kidding.
He's also a Filipino.
He lives within our area.
All right. Well, don't forget her vitamins, okay?
And no soft drinks and no candies.
Chocolates too.
Later, sis. We're eating right now.
Give me a call later, okay?
Bye. Your daughter's enjoying it here.
Bye!
I'm gonna eat you.
Stop it. Just eat your food.
Eat your food. You're crazy.
You're so tired.
Eat up.
All right.
This is me.
You're so near.
I told you so.
-Walking distance. -That's true.
Can we go inside?
Okay.
Let's not do that. Yumi, next time.
Uncle Clyde needs to rest.
Clyde, I just remembered.
Thank you very much for spending time with Yumi.
Thanks. Pleasure is mine. Do you want me to come back?
Don't make promises you can't keep to the child.
-I might expect something too. -When will you go back?
We'll see.
We'll meet again.
You'll meet again.
He hasn't even left yet, but you want him to go back already.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Yup.
Yeah.
I can make it, man.
No worries.
No worries. All right. I'll see you, man. Bye.
It's just that… I need a favor.
I need to meet a buyer.
Maybe you can babysit again?
Bok, I have… a gig scheduled today.
Okay.
Tito Clyde can't go to our house?
He can't, niece.
He has a prior commitment.
It happens. He forgets things easily.
Bok, okay. I'll do it.
-Okay. -Let's go.
-Yay! -Come.
Yay.
I knew it. You couldn't resist us.
-You keep that, all right? -Okay.
-Behave, okay? -Yup.
-All right. I love you, niece. -I love you too. Bye, Beauty.
I love you. Bye-bye. Take care.
-Clyde, take care. Okay? -I'll take it from here.
-Bye. -Bye-bye.
Yumi, I really need to go somewhere.
Are you going to leave me, Uncle?
No.
Can you come with me? It will be really quick.
Okay.
Really? Come on.
Where?
Let's go.
Okay. Let's go.
Hello. Did you pick anything?
Yeah. Not yet.
What's your best seller here for… kids?
Here, we have this,
and I'm sure your daughter will like this.
Okay. We'll have both.
-Thanks. -No problem.
-Excuse me. -Yes?
Have you seen Jack? He asked me to meet him here.
Yes. He was outside.
I saw him smoking.
-Okay. -Okay.
Ha! She thinks I'm your daughter.
That's okay.
Don't leave, okay?
Sure.
Promise?
Stay here. Wait for the order. I'll be back in a bit. Okay?
Okay. I promise. I'll stay here.
Okay. Good girl.
Hey, Jack.
-Hey, man. -Hey, man.
Gotta be honest, man.
I don't think I'll be staying here for good, so…
Oh, that's fucked up.
But…
Hey, things might change.
If I do, I still want the gig, all right?
Yeah, if you're planning to stay for longer.
We like the singing, man.
Yeah.
So all right, then.
Yeah. If you stay for good, just let me know.
We really could use someone like you.
-Yeah. -Thanks. Thanks, man. All right.
-See you. -Bye, man.
-Where's my daughter? -She's there.
Yumi, don't forget what we discussed.
That's our secret, okay?
-Yes. -We never went there.
Yes. It'll be a secret.
But… why is it a secret?
'Cause we never asked permission from Beauty.
But isn't that called lying?
Well…
Honestly, it's bad to keep secrets.
You always have to tell the truth.
They should always know where you are.
You can't leave the house alone.
You should always ask permission, okay?
So… we wouldn't keep it a secret?
Look at it this way.
If ever your mom or Beauty finds out,
they'd surely be mad and they wouldn't allow Uncle Clyde
to visit you anymore.
That's how it is.
Okay.
We're gonna keep this a secret.
But… can I share you a secret too?
Sure.
My dream is to become a singer.
That's great.
And I want to audition for the school program.
But Mommy and Beauty told me
to try auditioning next time.
But why?
They want me to take voice lessons first.
But, Uncle,
can I go to the auditions without voice lessons?
Of course.
It's possible. Why not?
Okay. Show me what you can do.
Wait.
About what Beauty and your mom said…
Don't you really want to take voice lessons first?
I want to do it, but Mom will enroll me next month.
The auditions are scheduled soon.
So… Do you really want to go to that audition?
Yes.
But I'm not sure if I'll pass.
You know what?
That's life. There are no guarantees.
Win or lose.
Whatever they say, you should try and fight. Okay?
You always have to try and give it your best.
Okay, my daughter?
Why are you calling me your daughter?
Right? That's what the waitress said earlier.
That you were my daughter?
Anyway, going back to your dream.
I will drop you off at the auditions.
Promise?
Promise.
What's that?
The promise handshake of Timmy and Papa Bear.
Who?
The bestest friends. You don't watch that?
You lick your hand and do the handshake to seal the pact.
Can't we do a fist bump instead?
Come on, Uncle. Please do it.
Okay.
Come on.
Take your gloves off.
Yay.
Smile, stretch.
Stretch.
I'm serious.
Stretch and then go…
Pucker.
Open.
Not from there.
Don't use your tonsils.
You'll have tonsillitis.
That sounded straight from a horror film.
Isn't the water cold?
It's not.
Uncle, it's hard to sing in the water.
That's how it is.
It's like Songbird's training.
Resilience.
Uncle, who's Songbird?
Never mind.
Now let's try it. Let's go.
Your turn.
Uncle Clyde, can we go inside?
Go inside?
Okay. Let's go.
Wow, it's freezing cold. Come.
Uncle Clyde, can you help me?
Oh yeah.
Yumi, you'll be the one to tell him. It's embarrassing.
He might think that I really like him.
Hey.
Hey.
-Uncle Clyde. -Hi.
Wait. I'm gonna open it.
Okay.
Apologies. It's Yumi's fault.
She wants to go somewhere. She wants you to come with us.
No problem.
A dollhouse.
Does it seem like a dollhouse?
There.
She's bright.
Did you make this, Uncle?
Yeah, I did.
But it's unfinished.
In fairness to you,
you seem to have a ten…
What does ten mean?
Tendency.
You're crazy.
I like it.
Can I have it, Uncle?
Stop it, Yumi.
Sure.
It's yours… when I finish it.
Okay.
But… for now,
you can have this.
Installment.
Thank you, Uncle.
Anyways, let's go.
Okay. I'm just gonna change clothes.
Okay. We'll wait for you.
Yay!
Uncle! Let's go!
Let's play, Beauty!
We will win!
Beauty.
More!
More, really?
You might end up flying.
This is yummy.
You want some?
Sure.
Thanks, baby cakes.
You're both so sweet.
If I didn't know both of you, I would've thought you were her dad.
You're crazy!
I'll catch you.
Kick.
Kick.
You're like dad and daughter.
-You know what, Yumi? -Why?
You are my human… earmuffs.
Uncle Clyde.
-What? -I have something to tell you.
What is it?
You're my new best friend.
Come.
Look at the swans.
-Yay! -Let's go over there.
You'd say that I did excellent this time.
She's so tired.
She's asleep already. See?
She's asleep.
We're lucky that Handsome is here.
He carried Yumi to her bed.
Say hi to Rachelle.
Oh my God! It's really you!
What on Earth do you think you're doing?
Why? Do you know each other?
Bok, that's Rustin.
God, Bok.
Bok, let me explain.
-Bok-- -No.
Fuck.
Damn you.
You deceived all of us.
You made us look stupid.
It's not like that at all.
What do you mean?
Fuck.
You didn't even tell us your real name.
What's your plan, huh?
I just wanted to get to know my daughter.
Get to know her?
When she's already doing fine?
I don't know you, but I know everything that you did.
Yes, I know, Bok, that I have many shortcomings.
Right.
A lot.
Where were you when Sheena was pregnant with Yumi?
Where were you when Yumi was born?
And when Sheena passed away?
Where?
Those were the times when you should've met Yumi.
What were you doing back then? Doing drugs in the Philippines?
You couldn't take a flight here?
Damn you.
That's the case, Bok. That's why I'm trying to make up for it.
I let Yumi spend time with you.
Damn you. I feel so dumb. I trusted you.
Why do you want to get close with Yumi? Why do you want to get close with Yumi? She's doing really well.
Why do you want to get close with Yumi? She's doing really well.
Beauty, Uncle… are you fighting?
-No. -No, we're not.
We're just talking. Go back to your room. Uncle Clyde will be leaving soon.
Thank you for today.
Good night.
-Good night. -Go back to your room.
Okay. Bye-bye.
Good night.
You owe her this much.
Don't mess with our lives.
What is it, Dad?
Rustin… I just wanted to check on you.
Here's what happened.
I just met my daughter.
It was great, until I was caught in the act, so…
I'm not allowed to see her anymore.
Okay.
I know what you're gonna say.
I'm a bad son, father, and husband.
Correct?
That's how you see me. Tell me.
Come on, Dad.
That's how I am, right?
Son.
I'm proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.
Rustin.
Come home.
What for?
To cause you more headaches?
I'm the source of problems wherever I go.
That's just who I am.
A failure.
Right?
So… why should I?
Of course I want you here.
You're my son.
Son.
Before your mom left us,
I made a promise that I wouldn't give up on you.
And I intend to keep that promise.
Son, it's just the two of us.
Come home.
Beauty, can you play with me?
I'm sorry, Yumi.
I have a student in ten minutes.
Well, can you ask Uncle Clyde to come?
No.
Well, can we go to his house?
No.
But why?
Because he's busy.
Well, can we ask him to come when he's no longer busy?
Can I call him?
No. No, Yumi. You can't call him.
You can't see him anymore.
Why is the answer always no?
'Cause…
No reason.
Uncle Clyde! Uncle Clyde!
What are you doing here?
Come inside.
-How did you get here? -I sneaked out to get here.
Now tell me…
why did you sneak out, Yumi?
Beauty says you can't go to our house anymore.
I can't talk to you anymore.
Why is that?
Yumi, my girl, it's because… Uncle Clyde has done a lot of bad things.
But are you sorry?
Of course.
Then just say sorry.
It's not that easy, Yumi.
Why isn't it?
Isn't it that when someone says sorry, you have to forgive them?
You know what, Yumi?
Someday…
you'll be hearing a lot of… nasty and bad things about me.
But I hope that you'll always remember our happy days.
Okay?
Of course, Uncle.
Just make up with them.
So that we can go to the auditions tomorrow.
The auditions are tomorrow?
Wow, bro.
Go and say sorry now.
Rustin.
-Is Yumi there? -Oh no. It's Beauty.
What do we do?
What if he restricts us from seeing each other again?
You haven't said sorry yet.
Here's the plan.
Let's play a game, hide-and-seek with Beauty.
-Okay? -Okay.
Rustin.
Come on, Uncle Clyde.
Yumi!
Yumi!
Yeah. Beauty can't find us.
Wait.
Okay.
Yay!
I'm flying!
Yumi!
Bye, Beauty!
-Hello, Bok. -Rustin, where are you taking Yumi?
Bok, I just promised the child something.
Just let me do this. This will be the only time.
-Bye. -Wait.
Where are we going, Uncle Clyde?
Are we going to play already?
No, Yumi. Not like that.
Remember, I told you before. It should be coming from your diaphragm.
Like that, again.
Yumi.
What's wrong?
Uncle Clyde, I'm tired already.
Okay.
Yumi.
Do you know what you're gonna sing at your auditions?
I'm still deciding.
Okay.
-Wow. -But Uncle Clyde, can we please play?
Please!
-Okay. -Please.
-Yay. -On one condition.
-What? -One last, okay?
Okay, never mind. Let's play.
Yay!
Come on, best friend!
Eat some.
Get the leaves.
I found one.
Yumi, I have to tell you something.
Tomorrow, after the auditions,
that might be the last day I'll see you.
Why, Uncle?
It just is.
Whatever happens,
promise me that you'll never forget me, okay?
But I don't want tomorrow to be our last day.
-Juice? -No.
Okay.
Good.
Yumi, just continue eating, okay?
Uncle Clyde has to make a phone call.
Okay.
-Bok. -Where's Yumi, Rustin?
Let me talk to her.
-Yumi. -Let's eat.
I'm good.
But somebody wants to talk to you first.
-Okay. -Okay.
Hello?
Yumi, baby.
Mommy, are you home already?
Yes. Where are you?
In a hotel.
What's the name of the hotel?
It's a secret, Mommy.
My daughter, didn't I tell you not to keep secrets from me?
It's a secret for one night only, please.
Please let me stay with Uncle Clyde.
Please.
My daughter, please tell me where you are.
Uncle Clyde, she's asking where we are.
Please don't tell her. I don't wanna go home yet.
Please.
I will return her after the audition.
What audition?
The school auditions.
She told you about this.
But you told her… not to go through with it.
And you know why.
God, Rustin. Don't you think?
Why would you take her there?
I'm sure you already heard her sing.
You know that she'll get rejected.
You're just setting her for heartbreak.
Did Mom say yes?
-Yeah. -Yay!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Do you know how to juggle?
Wanna see me juggle?
Yes.
Like a clown.
Uncle Clyde is a clown.
Apple.
It's so sour.
Try it.
Uncle Clyde.
Surprise!
You like it?
Yes, it's beautiful.
You're the best uncle ever.
The best, best friend ever.
Okay. Fine.
Go to sleep and stop moving around.
You're so hyperactive.
-Do your best at your audition tomorrow. -Yes.
-Do your best at your audition tomorrow. -Yes. Thank you, Uncle Clyde. I love you.
I love you too.
Good night.
Yumi,
I'm your real dad.
Yumi,
hug Daddy now.
I'm Rustin Clyde Villanueva.
I haven't seen you for a long time.
It's been eight years.
I wanted to hug you.
I wanted to tell you that I love you.
If it was possible.
You know?
Uncle Clyde, who are you talking to?
Why are you still awake?
Hey! I'm gonna tickle you.
If you don't start sleeping, I will spank you.
Go to sleep now!
Don't ever be like me.
Damn.
Why aren't they here yet?
Relax, sis.
They're coming.
What if that asshole doesn't return Yumi?
I should've called the police.
Sis, we heard Yumi last night, right?
We heard her talk. She's doing okay.
And I'm also sorry.
I believe that she'll arrive.
Together with Handsome.
The problem with you is that you trust so easily.
If something bad happens…
Sorry. I apologize.
I give in easily.
But, sis, as the lone witness,
I saw how they were with each other.
Handsome wouldn't hurt Yumi.
He will bring her here.
Uncle Clyde, wake up!
It's audition day.
-Audition day? -Yes!
-Okay, let's go! -Here.
Get my stuff. Help me.
Hurry.
My gloves. Go!
Okay.
Careful.
What?
There's no driver?
You know, Uncle Clyde, if we just run, we'll make it to the auditions.
That's a good idea.
Put this on first.
You might catch a cold and fail the auditions.
-Come on, let's go! -Wait. It's there.
Okay. Let's go.
Hurry up!
Let's go. Faster!
Uncle Clyde, let's go!
Uncle Clyde, let's go! Faster!
Let's go.
Wait. Where are we headed?
There.
Let's go there. Here.
Let's go. We're gonna be late!
-Okay. Where's the school? -There!
Applaud them. They'll be arriving.
-Just make sure. -They'll arrive.
Good job.
-I'm tired. -What?
-I'm tired. -Tired?
Come on.
Let's do this!
We'll make it. Faster.
-Okay. -Uncle Clyde, there! The door's there!
Really?
Okay. Faster.
Where are we?
-Where should we go? -There. Left.
-Where? -Left.
Okay.
You told me they were coming.
Where are they now?
We'll make it.
Wait, teacher. Wait.
Yumi's here.
-Mommy, you're here! -Yumi!
Also you, Beauty.
Yumi, you ready?
Yes.
Why is it That there's sadness in your eyes?
Is it because
You don't want me with you, my love?
Don't you notice
That I have feelings for you?
I hope you'll listen to my voice
And now I am uneasy
For my heart is lonely
I hope you take good care of it
And keep in mind
One promise
I promise
I'll never leave you
I promise
I'll never neglect you
I promise you'll no longer be alone
I promise that from now on
The two of us
I promise
I'll never leave you
I promise
I'll never neglect you
I promise
You'll no longer be alone
I promise that from now on
The two of us
Will be together
Thank you.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
I did it!
You did it.
-I did it. -You're so awesome.
I did it!
-I did it. -Yes, you did.
I did it.
High five.
I did it!
I didn't make it.
-It's okay. -It's okay.
It's okay.
And you did well, my little champ.
You were great out there.
And what did I tell you?
What's important is you tried, and…
I did my best.
Yes.
Yumi, come here.
-Yumi, come back. -Are you okay?
-Yumi, come back. -Are you okay? -Let's go. -I'm good.
-Let's go. -I'm good. Yumi, come here.
-Wait. -Yumi, please. Let's go.
I'm fine.
Bye, Uncle Clyde.
Thank you.
Yeah, I think you should go.
Okay. That's enough. Get out.
Thanks.
My dollhouse.
What is it, my daughter?
I have a dollhouse at Uncle Clyde's.
You brought toys there?
No, we didn't.
No. He made one.
And he said it's mine.
Can we get it?
Please.
Okay.
Yes.
I'm gonna get my dollhouse.
I'm gonna get my dollhouse.
Gonna get my dollhouse.
Hey, I know him! What's going on?
We found him in an unconscious state. It's probably an overdose. We're taking him to the hospital now.
It's probably an overdose. We're taking him to the hospital now.
-What hospital? -The Erasmus. I have to go!
-Uncle Clyde. -What happened?
Rustin overdosed.
Yumi!
Where's Uncle Clyde?
-Yumi… -My dollhouse…
Let's go.
But what about my dollhouse?
Yumi, we have to go.
But my dollhouse…
Let's go, Yumi.
Hello, Uncle Clyde.
Uncle Clyde?
Uncle Clyde?
Uncle Clyde?
Wake up already.
I promise
I'll never leave you
Uncle Clyde, wake up.
I promise I'll never neglect you
Uncle Clyde.
Please wake up.
I promise you'll no longer be alone
Uncle Clyde.
I promise that from now on the two of us
Uncle Clyde.
Wake up.
Uncle Clyde.
Please wake up.
Please. Wake up.
I want to play. Please.
Let's play now.
Uncle Clyde, please wake up.
Wake up.
Please.
Wake up.
Wake up.
You don't want to play?
Isn't that your favorite, Yumi?
You want oranges, baby?
Yes.
We should buy it later.
-Go on ahead. Go. -How 'bout the orange?
Come on, Yumi.
-Rache-- -Stay right there.
Rache.
Rache… will you please allow me to see Yumi again?
No.
You can't keep showing up, Rustin.
You're going to confuse her. What happens when you leave?
You know, Rache… I already have a job.
I can stay.
And then what?
Fulfill your role as her father?
How do we explain that to her?
Rache… if I leave it's wrong.
If I stay, it's still wrong.
I don't know what to do. I don't know where… I should put myself.
Just stay away from here.
Rache.
Hi, Sheena.
You know…
I have a new best friend.
She's so pretty.
What a waste.
I wasted everything.
She took after you.
She's so pretty.
But she's talented with instruments,
and that's what she got from me.
Sorry.
I wish you'd forgive me, Sheena.
I wish I went through with it.
And not wasted my time with rock and roll.
Damn.
You get it.
When I first saw Yumi…
I felt love at first sight.
I now understand…
your plan for the two of us…
but I'm so hard-headed.
That was my last memory of him.
Shortly after, we moved to another house.
You're my new best friend.
-Come on. Let's go over there. -Yay!
-Say… -Stars. Stars.
Mommy told me that he got well and went back to the Philippines.
I'm flying.
Whatever happens…
promise me that you'll never forget me, okay?
It was not until a few years ago that they told me the truth.
Uncle Clyde is my biological father, and he's a drug addict.
After he went back to the Philippines, he went to rehab.
He wanted to get help to be better.
But he relapsed when his father, my grandfather I never met, died.
That's all they really know and remember about him.
But for me, I knew a different man.
There's a lot he's forgotten ever since he had a stroke.
Hey.
You're gossiping about me.
Come on, sir.
I'll leave you two alone.
Thanks.
It's me.
Yumi.
Yumi.
Look here.
You visited me in Rotterdam.
You made me rocket ships.
And…
You made me sing inside a drum full of water.
Do you remember now?
And I now know the name of that Songbird you were talking about.
Really, don't you remember me?
I'm sorry, child.
You might be mistaken.
Ma'am, sorry, but sir needs to eat.
Can I stay?
Of course.
Can I be the one to feed him?
It's okay.
Thanks.
Let me do it.
Aren't you going home, miss?
I'm leaving in a while.
Is it okay for me to visit you again?
Sure.
Nobody visits me.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Good night.
I made that.
It's for my best friend.
Who is your best friend?
It's…
I'm going.
Can I?
I'm off.
Whatever challenges life throws us,
we will face all of them together.
I didn't expect that I would find a partner in life.
This is just the beginning of our journey.
I love you very much.
And I love you very much.
Mercado family! Let's take pictures.111
All right, take your positions.
Come here, hurry.
Come on over, kids.
Bro, watch out.
Keep going.
Who's going to win?
And the winner is…
Good job!
All right, Dennis. Put on the garter. Does it fit?
There we go.
May I? Okay?
That girl was cute.
Ask her out.
Oh, boy. Should I take just anybody, Mom?
If you don't get a move on, I'll settle down before you do.
Tell you what, Mom.
Let's put off expanding our tablea business, then.
What do you think?
Business always gets in the way of one's love life, doesn't it?
Mom, I'm happy. I promise.
Of course.
I didn't mean it that way.
Come on, dance with me.
Yeah, all right, Mom.
-I'll join you later. -Come on!
In a bit.
I got a flat tire. I gotta get it fixed.
Will it take long, bro? Just call Mom so she knows.
Are you all there?
-Yeah. -Okay. I'll be there as soon as I can.
Excuse me, sir, can you hold my bag, please?
Okay. Thank you, sir.
-And then… -You speak Tagalog?
-Only a little. -A little.
Katya, I'm finally here!
I did it.
Son!
Mom.
Mom, this is Oksana.
My partner in the group.
She's from Russia.
-Hello, ma'am. -Hi.
Hey. Cut that out.
-Hello! -How is everyone? Nice meeting you all.
Hey, don't joke around her. She can understand you.
-How fun! -Hey, Mom.
-Let's take a picture. -Sure! Where's the camera?
-Here, Mom. -Bro, she's pretty!
-Sweetheart, would you mind? -No worries, ma'am.
We're doing a wacky shot. Wacky!
Wacky shot, bro!
Where are the chocolates?
Here, Mom.
I love chocolate.
-No doubt. -Wait.
Hold on. Wait.
-Go. -Yeah, sure.
-We're going. -Go, bro!
Kaka!
-Nanny? -Kaka!
Hey, Nanny Blessie.
Kaka!
What happened?
-Hey, Denden… -You two know each other?
She's my guest. The one I was telling you about. I took care of her in Russia.
This is Kaka.
Kaka, he's my boss that I was telling you about. Denden.
Same with Oksana. Nickname, Kaka.
Denden, Kaka. Same same!
Isn't he handsome?
Not bad.
Kaka, are you sure you're not hurt?
Shit!
She's got a mouth on her.
What do you expect?
She got it from me.
I was with them almost all the time.
They're like my own children, Kaka and Katya.
Oh, Nanny.
My sweet baby.
All right, here you are, baby.
You see, Den,
their father was always working.
Busy.
Eventually, her sister Katya got busy doing ballet, too.
Always busy, huh?
My dear grandchildren!
-Grandma! -Grandma!
-Bless. Very good. -God bless.
Okay, go to Uncle.
God bless.
They're taking the kids to Manila because their school enrollment's soon.
Well, then take your time.
Don't come in tomorrow and attend to your guest.
You're so thoughtful.
Thank you so much, Den.
-It's nothing. -Stay for dinner. It's late.
It's okay. They're probably wondering where I am.
-I'm going. -Okay.
Have a good evening.
Milo! There you are.
Are you a good boy? You miss me?
You know what, tomorrow, I am going to walk your dog.
The poor thing's bored out of his mind.
I heard you're bored in here. Are you bored?
It's okay, Mom. I'll just bring him to the cafe.
How's the girl you were with earlier?
I drove them home.
But Mom, did you know she's Nanny Blessie's guest?
-Really? -Yeah.
She's beautiful.
And there she goes again.
I think it's wonderful she speaks Tagalog.
Yes, she does.
Why don't you ask her out?
You're so persistent, Mom.
-Come on. -I'm going to bed. Good night.
-Just do it. -Come on! Let's go, Milo.
-Oksana. -Hey, bro. Thank God.
Bro, I'm done here. A second longer and my nose will bleed.
-I've used up all my English. -It's okay.
Oksana, excuse me. I must clean now, okay?
-Sure, thank you. -Bro.
It's true.
Wow. Your dad seems so unreal.
Please excuse me, I have to get to work.
Hang on, let me clean this up for you. It'll only take a moment.
Look, Denden. She's threatening to pay.
-I'll pay. -Oksana, there's no need.
Yes, we're sure. It's on the house.
Sit… Sit there.
Nanny, you're so stubborn.
I told you, you didn't have to come in today.
Denden, it was Kaka who told me to come to work.
She'll just stay here at the cafe and won't get in the way.
It's fine, Nanny. Don't worry about your pay for the day.
Go show her around.
I'm telling you, Denden, even if I could skip work,
I wouldn't have the courage to do that anyway.
I know nothing about kayaking.
Those are the things she's into.
I trip over my feet climbing stairs. You expect me to climb a mountain?
Okay, all right.
-Yes. -Nobody with you?
-That's okay. -Have you eaten?
Okay, just a minute, okay?
Son.
-Hey, Mom. -She's by herself!
I'm taking this to her.
Long time, still. That's still a long time.
What else do you plan on doing? Anything else on your bucket list?
-Yes. -My brother!
My brother can go with you!
They're just being silly.
Don't worry about it.
-We insist. -Mom…
He will accompany you.
-Yes, Denden will. -Hey, don't impose.
-Just do it. Go with her. -All right, fine.
Is it okay if I join you?
We'll have fun, I promise you.
We'll make the most out of your five days here.
-Yes! -Happy now?
Great job, bro!
No, it's very good for you.
I had some paperwork to do.
There were some things I had to take care of.
Wow, feels good.
-Thank you. -Okay. Let's get ready.
When my dad was still alive,
we would always talk about Russia, you know, and…
our bonding was traveling.
Russia was supposed to be our first overseas trip.
I just never had the chance.
Propose a toast?
I'm no good at…
"Cheers."
Thanks.
Dang.
We're up so high.
Is this what you meant by taking risks?
-Are you sure that's the last one? -Yeah, that's the last one.
Because I'm game if there's anything else you want to do.
-Anything in mind? -I don't wanna take too much of your time.
Where did that come from?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Wow, thank you.
Thank you, but…
You know, I've dated… I've dated in the past.
There were some girls but…
They don't understand me. They're all the same.
There was even this one girl that dated me
so she can get free drinks at the cafe.
Shameless!
"You can explain everything at the precinct!"
Blessie really taught you things!
The things Nanny teaches you.
No, please.
I've always dreamed of paragliding with my dad.
You know, it's funny… In Lowell and Monette's wedding?
My costume? I wore a flight suit.
Nanny showed some pictures.
Nanny Blessie, I swear…
Mt. Makiling is infested with blood leeches called alimatoks.
Looks like we have a sukob coming up.
Why, is Monette's brother getting married?
No, silly.
I meant you.
What is "sukob"?
In Philippine culture,
we believe siblings can't marry in the same year.
So, our brother Dennis here,
his girl will have to wait.
Don't you have work to do? Why don't you get to it?
Hey, leave them alone. They might start to like each other.
Kidding!
Just joking!
I think she's a keeper! Who cares about the sukob superstition?
-She said she's joking. -That's my Russian girl!
I'm going to create a fans club.
"Ka-Den."
Son.
Oksana's leaving,
so you better level up your moves.
What are you talking about?
Level up!
Yes, all right.
Nanny, tomorrow we'll go swimming.
-The two of us? -Yes, both of you.
Stop it, Nanny.
Ooh. Ouch.
That feels so good.
Come on, let's eat!
Thank you very much.
Kaka, get out of the water. Let's eat.
You're so beautiful, my darling.
Come. You wear your shirt.
I AM RUSSIAN I AM FILIPINO
It suits you!
Let's go. I'm starving.
Now, we will use our hands. You say, "kinamot."
-You get that. -"Kamot" or "kamay" means hand.
This is shrimp.
Thank you for this.
I won't forget this, Den.
Come on, Nanny, you're being silly.
-I really missed… -I miss you, too.
Nanny, it's nothing.
So you can spend more time together.
My sweetie.
Eat more. It's very good.
Just eat. Quit it with the drama.
Try some mangoes. Sweet. Like that.
-Okay. -Like this.
I'll always remember this day.
Don't be silly!
What are your plans when you get back to Russia?
-We will miss you, Kaka. -Miss you too.
-Where's your jacket? -In the house.
Okay, I'll get it. Den!
Den, hold on. I'm going to get her jacket.
I'll miss Nanny.
Perhaps I could. I wish!
Do you think we have a chance?
Your grandpa collected those when he was still in Russia.
Then your father inherited them.
You know it was your father's dream to go to Russia with you.
What about you?
Don't you want to follow Oksana there?
Mom…
Son.
This is the first time I've seen you so happy.
If she's the reason why,
then why let her slip away?
Well, I got my tourist visa faster than expected.
Then my mother and my brothers,
they offered to run the cafe.
-And, there was a promo… -"Explain everything at the precinct."
My dad would have wanted to see this.
Oksana, mahal kita.
I love you, too. Mahal kita.
-Of course, I know my angles. -I love it. Gorgeous.
I don't have a good angle but I make it work. Armpit shot!
Yeah. Oh, my God! What a beauty shot!
-Hang on a sec. -Yes!
-Give me a wacky shot, sis! -Hey!
One more!
There we go.
Finally, a Tagalog speaker! My struggle with language is on another level here.
It's difficult to understand them.
-"Gorgeous"? -Why do you look shocked? Is it so weird?
Just be happy for me. That's his pet name for me. "Gorgeous."
Isn't that right?
No way. You're lying.
-He's your husband? -Yes. Why?
Yes! Can't you tell we're doing it?
Anywhere, everywhere, anytime. Right?
Oh, my God, it feels so good.
So don't make that face!
We do it every day in that alley over there.
Wow, you got yourself a doll.
-She's like a doll. -Let's go.
-What are you doing? -Let's go!
-Take care, Gorgeous! -Hey! Stop the car!
Thank you. Salamat.
Get in.
Such a big house.
Commander.
Come on, let's meet Dad.
Look who decided to show up!
Dad…
Princess, you've grown thin.
Dad, this is my boyfriend, Dennis.
Sambo.
- Lunch is ready. - Good.
Thank you.
Dad.
This is our brand, Tabléa.
I… Nanny Blessie!
Da! Yes.
Just a little bit, sir. Not too much.
Thank you, Dad.
Do not dally.
Dennis Mercado can't hold his liquor.
NOT A MAN. DOES NOT EAT NORMAL FOOD. CAN NOT DRINK.
Dad, Dipolog is so beautiful.
You know, Dennis, I really take my hat off to you.
Dad, there's no need to get worked up.
You will not survive in the wild with him.
Dad, I'll keep that in mind
if I ever decide to live in a forest.
The new Pochet infusions.
Delicious. It's good.
I'm sorry, princess. Your father is getting old.
I got it. Okay. I'll see you later. I'm going to cook, okay?
He better be good.
Dad, he'll surprise you.
Milk, please. Quick.
Cheers.
Yes! Great.
It's too strong.
Shit.
Go! Get out!
Hey, friend…
What happened to you? You look like you lost a bet.
Someone from home!
George? What are you doing here?
This is mine. I'm the owner. That's why it's called Gorgeous.
Where's your husband? He might get jealous again.
He left me behind. He went hunting. We're not talking.
A toast for all the Filipinos who are heartbroken over Russians.
Let's toast.
What about you, then?
What did you and Oksana fight over?
No, it's not her.
It's her dad.
I can't seem to do anything right…
around him.
I keep messing things up.
I had a plan, and it flopped.
Then I tried to go with the flow, but I tripped up.
I don't know how to make it up to him this time.
All fathers are strict.
Doesn't matter if they're Russian or Filipino.
There will be no man good enough for their daughters.
No one. Take my father, for instance.
He kept telling me, "Sergei's just going to leave you!"
But look how much he loves me.
It's too much!
It's suffocating.
He keeps having doubts about me, thinking I'm cheating behind his back.
So I'm feeling the urge to prove him right.
Maybe actually try it for once.
Don't!
-Why? -Don't do it.
-What do you mean? -Put those back on.
What do you mean?
I don't want to put it back on! What's it to you?
-Ow! -That's enough!
My God! I see you're into bondage.
My safe word is "kukuruza."
-What? -Kukuruza!
-Wake up! -Are you there?
-Shit! -Gorgeous!
-Hurry up! Get in there! -Gorgeous.
Go in! You'll love it there!
Okay, my love, I forgive you.
My love, what are you doing to me?
My God, babe!
Baby? Can we talk?
Ten, 11, 12…
I have a hanky.
What is…
Dennis can take you, Dad.
He will take you, Dad. Dennis can take you.
Sir! I'm down, sir. No more.
Please stop.
Yes.
Hey! But Dennis is not one of them.
I hate you!
Always playing hard to get.
I can't do it.
I love Oksana.
Just kill me.
Because I can't bear to hurt her.
I came all the way to Russia.
I'm even courting her father.
Oksana, I love you. That's how much I love her.
Fine, all right. You found your true love. It's true love.
This is crazy.
After you had your way with my body, you leave me hanging like this?
It didn't work.
My powers have no effect on you. Oh, my God. How dare you, Dennis?
Damn you. You just wore me out.
The heck?
Are you asleep? What the hell.
Hey! Wake up!
Is he dead?
No, he's alive.
Where is Dad? Is Dad all right?
Dad, but you should've told me. I would've cut my trip short.
No, Dad. No.
Dad, I promise I will never leave you again.
Princess.
Princess.
Welcome home, Dad!
Hi, Auntie. Hi, Nanny.
Good morning to both of you.
Kaka! You're finally back home.
Hello, Fyodor! Are you feeling better?
And eat plenty of soup, drink plenty of water.
-I will. -Get well soon, Fyodor! Get well.
-Son! -Mom!
How's your arm?
It's okay, Mom.
-You better go, Mom. -Okay, bye.
-Bye, Auntie! Bye, Nanny! -Goodbye.
I got the recipe, sir, from Nanny Blessie.
You made it very obvious, sir.
Because I see my dad in you.
I miss my dad so much, sir.
-Yes. -This one, sir?
Salamat.
Jeez… Why are you even asking?
Of course you did. Everything was worth it. You have no idea.
We're going to get married?
Sukob.
-Remember? -Right. Okay.
Oksana, I love you.
Dad!
Princess.
Dad, Dennis and I have decided…
Princess…
-It's settled. -Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Princess.
I will be fine.
Dad, one call and I'll get here as fast as I can.
DETERMINED, TRUSTWORTHY, SELFLESS, LOVES MY DAUGHTER.
Loves Oksana.
Saved me.
Mission accomplished, General Big Bear?
Yes, he passed the test.
Princess is in good hands.
We can proceed with our mission with no cause of alarm.
Sure. Yes. I mean, affirmative.
Yes, General?
…and place your attention on your breath.
Breathe in…
and out.
Just put your attention on the breath coming into your body as you inhale.
It's clear.
Nothing.
And as you breathe out… [exhales]
…the air that comes out of you is black.
And that black is any anxiety, stress,
any worries that you carry.
And as you breathe out, feel it leave your body.
Breathe in clear air and breathe out the black.
Breathe in clear air.
Breathe out--
[man] There I am standing
in front of this old nothing house, staring at it,
and this bloke comes over.
And I recognize him, you know? Older, but I recognize him.
I said, "It's me, Paul Emery. I used to live in that house."
And he goes, "No. No, you didn't."
I said, "You're Chris."
"Chris. You had that German Shepherd." He says, "How did you know that?"
"We lived in this house for years."
-This old fellow-- -You heading to WA for work?
No.
Never actually been there before.
Yourself?
Home. Headed home.
No, I just had to, uh, clear out…
Clear out of Queensland.
Sort myself a car.
Some place to stay and that.
I'm Paul.
Henry.
[Henry] Turn her off again.
And again.
Yeah. Let's hear her, mate.
I need an address for the transfer of ownership.
-I can put down a motel? -I don't know about that.
-[Paul] That's where I'm living. A motel. -[man] Can't put down a motel.
I've got a PO box you can use, put that down while he sorts himself out.
-[man] Okay. -Thanks.
Thanks, Henry.
All right.
$1,600.
-Here, mate. That's for you. -Nah.
Come on, mate. I mean, you really helped me out.
[whispers] No.
[Paul] What do you do for work, Henry?
[Henry] Everything I know is in my hands.
Can't hardly work now though.
I'll be fucked in a few years' time.
[Paul] And why's that?
Can't fuckin' breathe, mate.
I know what it's like to be on the other side of things.
You got your last few fuckin' dollars in an envelope there.
I see it all over you.
[man at door] Paul Emery?
[Henry's voicemail] I can't, uh, take your call at the moment.
If you leave me a message, I'll endeavor to call you back later.
Henry, it's Paul.
I need to talk to you about something.
I might need to shift out of the motel.
So give us a ring back when you get this.
Okay. Talk soon.
So it's just a bit further up here. There's a house. You can drop me off.
All right, I have to tell you, Henry…
[clicks tongue] I came out here to do a job for some people.
And there's a mate of mine.
Mark. He asked me if I knew anyone who could handle a bit of work.
I talked to him about you.
Yeah, just here is good.
Yeah, this is good. Just here.
What kind of work?
I have to let him tell ya.
I don't do violence.
No, Henry, come on. It's not like that.
We'll meet him tomorrow. He'll tell you all about it.
Have you dyed your hair?
What?
Have you dyed your hair?
Yeah, I just went a bit darker.
[chuckles] It looks good.
Thanks.
Tell him we're on.
Yep.
Great. I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks for the lift.
-Where's Paul? -He couldn't make it.
Get in.
Get in.
Put your seatbelt on.
I don't do violence.
No. I've heard.
[Mark sighs] Fat cunt.
[Henry] What are we doing here?
[Mark] Wait here.
[man] How you doin', Mark? Good?
[Mark] Why'd you call me?
[man] Look, I've got your passports ready.
They're all clean and unmarked. And I'm so sorry I couldn't get the money.
-I'm sorry. -[Mark] Don't be sorry. Why?
[man] I tried everything I could.
-[Mark] But-- -I'll get it for you Tuesday.
By the way, there's a girl shifting gear around
out of Central Massage.
[Mark] Who?
You remember Letessia?
-[Mark] Who? -[man] Letessia.
[Mark] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[man] She's dealing out of the rooms.
-Next week, Ken. -[Ken] 12:00 sharp?
-[Mark] What will you do? Thank you. -[Ken] Get your money.
[Mark] No carparks from now on. Fuck.
Shift around gear. Is that it?
No, we don't fuckin' touch it.
You don't use when you work with us, okay?
I've heard that you don't have many acquaintances, which is good for us.
Works well.
'Cause you don't discuss this work with anyone.
Open that.
It's blank.
It's just here.
[Mark] You know, he's in, uh, trouble. Old mate. Paul.
That's why they had to bring him out here.
[Henry] What's wrong?
If he contacts you and it's not through me, just let me know.
Don't you go tell Paul what I said about him.
Where's your place?
Little piece of fluff.
Thanks.
One, two, three, four, five.
I'm a sworn member of the Western Australian Police,
conducting duties at the Undercover Crimes Unit
in the investigation into the abduction and murder
of James Liston on the 12th of May, 2002.
Today's date is May 6, 2010.
My CO number is 452
and I'm using the assumed name of Mark Frame.
[Henry] Old mate, he called me last night.
I let it go to voicemail like… like you said.
Uh, he wanted me to, uh, to collect this, though.
Yeah, I'll take that.
He's at a property out of town for a while.
What?
I thought I saw a car.
What'd it look like?
Ah, it's a van. It's turned off now.
[Mark] Hey, just hold on a sec.
All right, Henry?
Have you seen the sea?
[Mark] Hey.
Hey, Gary.
-This, um, came for Paul yesterday. -[door closes]
Henry.
Come here.
This is Henry Teague.
That's Gary.
You can't come in here dressed like that.
Get yourself some proper clothes.
You look like a fuckin' criminal.
Seriously, sort it out. Sit down.
About Paul.
He has issues in the past and we have to resettle him.
That creates an opening.
We're a closed group.
We don't often let people in,
and when we do, we take care of our own.
How's that sound to you, Henry?
Yeah, why… Yeah, why not? [chuckles]
Look, Mark. I don't have enough money to buy new clothes, mate.
-I can't fuckin' afford that, you know-- -Ah, mate. Mate, shh, listen. Here. Look.
Yeah, don't worry about it.
I'll look after you.
See?
Wait. I've gotta ask you something.
That fella up there, Gary, all right, he's the head here, okay?
But there are people who he answers to and they answer to people above them.
But he told me to ask you if you'd done time before.
Yeah, I have, yeah.
Mm-hmm. What for?
[scoffs] Been in and out a few times, nothing serious.
So no longer stints then?
I did time for an assault up in the NT, okay?
That's why no fucking violence, you know, because of the time for repeat offenders.
If you've done longer stints, just fuckin' tell me, okay?
Don't wait for me to ask you. How long for?
Two years.
It was at a family crisis center and there was this fella
who kept chattin' about my fuckin' missus all the time.
I went for him.
He ran off into the trees, I went after him.
Yeah, I don't fuck-- I don't care what you done, okay?
What I care about is you being honest with me.
Yeah. Be honest with me.
That's all I ask, mate, serious. Here.
Cheers.
What?
Just… Nothin', man. All right.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
[yelling] Oi!
What did you do?
Get off the fuckin' table. Get-- Here. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come here. Sit on the-- Stand there.
You've got bare feet.
-What did you do that for? -I didn't mean it.
Fuckin' hell.
Can you just pay attention?
All right? If I cut myself, whose fault is it?
Fuck.
What are you gonna do next time?
-Clean it up. -No, pay attention.
[sighs] All right. Come here.
Listen. Look at me.
Sorry I sweared at you, all right? Go put your shoes on.
[Mark] Hey, you want me to teach you something I learned at work?
Okay, you gotta close your eyes, yeah?
Close your eyes and you gotta breathe in,
and when you breathe in,
you're gonna imagine that you're breathing in really clear air.
You gonna get out in a sec?
And then when you breathe out, you're…
you're gonna breathe out all the black…
Did you know…
[Mark] …dark, bad air.
What? [sighs]
That there's a frog that makes this sound?
[Mark] And that's all the things you don't like.
Up top. Oh, don't hurt me.
-I'm not trying to hurt you. -Like when you're angry…
You're getting it in my beard!
…or when you're scared and stuff.
-Close your eyes. Trust me. -No.
Things you don't like and then you breathe in the clear air…
…and out the blackness.
There you go.
Your whole body's gonna relax
from your feet, your knees,
your hips,
your stomach, your chest. [exhales]
In the clear air…
…out the black--
[man] Do you need a hand?
Sorry.
Ah, I'm just fucking with you. You look good. Come on.
Now he's gonna make me go shopping.
[Mark] Hey.
Shut the fuckin' door.
-[Mark] What's going on here? -Sit down.
Hand over your phones.
What do you need our phones for?
[Gary] Unlock them.
What do you need them for?
We're deleting all of Paul's contacts.
He's downstairs. Give him this.
John's taken care of everything.
Have a drink with Paul
and then we're taking him to the airport.
And you, do whatever Mark tells you to do.
[Mark] There you fuckin' are.
Sit down.
-Hey, Henry. -How you doing?
All right, there's ten grand in there.
Passport's been issued.
Ticket to the UK as well.
And your visa's good for a year.
Listen, mate, whatever this is about, I don't want to know about it.
We don't need to know. You told John and that's all that matters.
Okay?
And he reckons it'll all be over by the time you get back.
We've all got a history, mate. We've all got a past.
And now you're nobody. Woo-hoo.
Cheer up, man.
I'm gonna get us a drink.
Henry…
Trust Mark.
Trust Mark. Yeah?
If you're honest-- If you're honest with these guys,
[whispers] you'll be looked after, mate. You'll be looked after.
What are we doing out here?
We're making sure that Paul's clean.
Who's John?
He's your employer.
[Mark] Sorry, I can be a bit of a cunt.
I've had issues myself in the past.
This is the only family I've ever had.
So, listen, if you have any issues,
if you need help or what have you,
just come out here and you wait,
and I'll find you, brother.
[woman] After the child was abducted from the underpass,
he was questioned several times due to his record.
He refused psychological testing.
He stated he had a history of violent offences.
There's an assault in the NT.
Details aren't listed.
We've been tasked P28 to reassess for the coronial inquest.
At the time of the abduction, P28's file was closed
after detectives found insufficient time or evidence
for him to be considered a person of interest.
He has since relocated to Western Australia.
We've been tasked with P27.
He has a history of assault and sexual violence.
His movements place him in the region, the bypass road
on the morning of the 12th of May, 2002.
-[man] We're tasked with P26. -[imperceptible]
He has a lengthy history of domestic assault charges.
There are currently four AVOs ascribed to him.
Mark.
[man] Thank you for everything you've done on this case.
It's your groundwork got us to this point, so you should be proud of that.
See you on the other side.
Flying back to Queensland?
Hey!
We burnt your car.
[man] The decision is we can't have him in densely populated areas,
so isolate him further.
Downside is we can't have physical surveillance in remote areas,
which means you'll be unprotected and unobserved
apart from the recording equipment.
The whole operation hinges on you getting closer with him.
I know you fuckin' know this.
Don't find yourself in terrain that you're unfamiliar with.
Weigh the balance of the closeness you could form against your own vulnerability.
-[door slams] -[Henry] Fuck!
I said wait in the car.
You were taking ages.
Could've been one of those silent alarms.
[Mark] Ah, I sorted that ages ago.
Here. I forgot your brand.
-Here you go. -Thanks, mate.
-[Henry] Do you want a smoke? -[Mark] Nah. I quit.
[Henry on recorder] Do you want a smoke?
[Mark on recorder] Nah. I quit.
[Henry] I couldn't find a job anywhere before this.
You got a criminal record, you're fucked these days.
My dad was in the Army.
Thought about joining the Reserves myself.
I did all the tests.
I failed the psych 'cause I fuckin' sleepwalk.
[son] Do I look like a monster?
[Mark] What?
[son] I can taste with my feet and hear with my fur.
-What am I? -[Mark] What?
[son] A moth.
[Mark] You're a pain in the arse, that's what you are.
-[doorknob rattling] -No, here, here. Here.
All right, mate. See you Thursday.
This is Detective Senior Constable Kate Rylett
in the presence of Detective Senior Constable Graham Ikin.
We are carrying out a timing of the movements
of POI 28, Henry Teague, on the 12th May, 2002.
P28 claims to have left his home at 2:50 p.m.
and returned at 5:30 p.m.
He drove along the bypass towards a relative's house,
he parked and collected an engine part.
He returned along the same road, passing the bus stop at the underpass,
where the victim was last seen between 4:05 and 4:10 p.m.
He claims not to have seen the child,
but places himself driving past
at the same time the child was observed by other witnesses,
including those on a passing bus.
That bus wasn't taking passengers.
It drives through the underpass at 4:15 p.m.
A number of witnesses on that bus saw the boy.
He was waiting by the side of the road
with a man standing behind him,
leaning against a pillar of the underpass,
his leg bent behind him like a stork.
A second bus passes at 4:18 p.m.
There are no sightings of either the boy or the man from that last bus
which means in those three minutes,
between 4:15 to 4:18 p.m., he's taken.
He claimed that a camera, angled at the road,
would've seen his car driving through the site.
That camera was not operational.
He-- He's only placed himself at the scene
because he thinks he was recorded passing through it.
[Ikin] P28 claimed he drove through the site without stopping,
proceeding directly to the home of an elderly friend
with whom he spent the next half hour.
The alibi no longer resides at her home address.
When asked why he hadn't raised the alibi earlier,
P28 stated it was because he did not want to upset her.
[Ikin] Hello, Mari.
How are you today?
What was the period of time you were hoping to talk to her about?
We can't discuss that.
[Rylett] He claimed to have been with her between 4:10 and 4:45 p.m.,
however, she's unable to confirm that.
Forensic investigators attended his property
in the days following
and conducted an examination of his vehicle.
Tape lifts were taken through the interior of the car.
There's no record of the results here.
Senior police considered him an unlikely suspect regardless,
as he did not drive the "boxy black vehicle"
sighted by multiple witnesses at the scene.
The conclusions were a lack of evidence
and insufficient time for him to have abducted the child
and returned home by 5:30
to what he stated he'd been doing.
Which was what?
Cleaning.
You know, when I was a kid, I used to ride the cane trains all the fuckin' time.
Out of my fuckin' head, I was.
I never felt more free until now, mate.
I reckon this is what fuckin' real dreams are made of.
You know Paul?
When I first met him, I… I didn't even fuckin' trust him.
I thought he was a fuckin' reporter or something, you know?
With all the fuckin' questions he was asking.
That cunt couldn't be a reporter.
He can hardly fuckin' read.
It's true.
He's a fuckin' dumb dummy.
-Done? -[whispers] No, not yet.
[Mark] Hey.
This is Henry.
Here you go.
Good?
-Yeah, you'll let me know? -Yep.
Meeting him is a marker of trust.
It means you've been brought further in.
He's a detective senior sergeant.
His influence goes right up through the ranks.
If you ever see him out, don't approach him,
don't talk to him.
He's hooked us up with an arms contact.
We've got to go and meet him out of town.
[arms dealer] Two 1911s, two Berettas, three Glocks.
I can do the lot for, like, 12…
I like firearms.
I used to collect them.
Now it's antiques, little trinkets like this.
Who's Rylett?
-Rylett? -Mm.
Oh. Rylett Holdings. Yeah, I used to work for them back east.
[Rylett] This is Kate Rylett.
I'm after any archival video material related to P28, Henry Teague.
[detective on video] What was your relationship?
We met through church.
[detective] Why have you come forward?
Well, I don't… I don't know about this case, but, um…
but if a child's gone missing and he was in the area, then I…
think that…
[detective] You think he was involved?
Yeah.
He drove us into the forest this one night, um…
And told me to get out and pretend that I didn't know him.
And… and then he's… He's just driven off, and he's just left me there. Uh…
Then he's… He circled back round,
he's pulled over to talk me into the car,
and then when I climbed in, he's…
[voice shaking] He said, "You should… You should be more careful who you trust."
-[Ikin sighs] -[detective] And then what happened?
[Henry] I used to be a tow-truck driver, you know?
Take the wrecks to… to be destroyed down at the shredding yard.
If you ever needed to,
that would be a very good place to get rid of a body, you know.
If you ever needed to.
They don't check the cars?
Nah.
A lot of fuckin' crosses out here, mate.
I used to be a member of the church, back east. Yeah.
A charismatic revival.
Do you know the type?
[Mark] Yeah.
You shake and you flap about.
Then they go into fucking convulsions.
I had a falling out with the pastor, though.
He said there was no such thing as an unforgivable sin.
[scoffs] All sins could be forgiven.
"That's not what it says in the Bible," I fuckin' told him.
Standing up there, preaching things that aren't fuckin' true.
Fuckin' lying.
[Mark on recorder] When we get there, I'll need to go off and meet our contact.
You just hold there at the caravan park [voice distorts] till I come back for you.
Your recording device failed. Take this one and hand me yours.
You guys, you, you need to back off further, all right?
You're following way too close.
All right. You all right?
You just… [sighs in exasperation]
Just… just run me through the fuckin' scenario.
There's no scenario, mate.
Local police were alerted to activity at the warehouse we planned to use.
We had to clear out.
Fuck.
[Mark banging on door] Henry! -Buddy. -Henry!
Got to move out, mate.
Hurry up. Get your shit. Serious.
-Quick! Anything else here? -Yeah.
-No. -All right.
Do you, um…
Do you want to come up to the house?
The missus is out of town at the moment.
[Mark] Nice.
Back in a sec.
What does your missus do?
She suffers with anxiety and depression.
She doesn't really leave the house that much.
Oh, yeah?
Bought that with the money you paid me for the work last week.
-[inhales] -Where did you grow up?
A lot of army bases.
I'm the black sheep of the family, mate.
They're ashamed of me. Can't fuckin' stand me.
Why's that?
I don't know.
How old are you, Mark?
Forty-six.
-Nearly 50, eh? -Yeah.
Old man.
What kind of music do you listen to, Mark?
I don't really… listen to music.
How do you mean?
Well, I'm not really a song person.
Yeah. [chuckles]
Hey, listen, um,
there's preparations for something that's happening,
and I've talked about bringing you in.
But it would mean travelling out of town,
like, interstate, if you're up for it.
I'm there, mate. I'm there.
Brilliant. All right.
I'll let 'em know.
It's good to have a friend, Mark, you know.
Someone you can chat to.
-Yeah. -It's been a while.
We see through to the other side, you and me.
That's why we get on so well.
Yeah. You're doin' good.
Oh, fuck, I'm tired, man.
I have a long drive back. I'm going to have to head off.
Sorry.
Um… It's a nice place.
-[bottle thuds] -Mark, wait.
-[blows landing] -[Mark] Hey. What are you fuckin' doing?
All right, enough.
All right, one time. That's it, all right?
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Shake my hand.
-[son] Promise. -All right. okay.
I'm gonna-- How much do I gotta count?
-Forty. -Forty.
Thirty? Thirty. I'll count to 30.
One, two, three,
four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven…
You in here? Huh?
Buddy?
I'm gonna tickle ya.
I'm gonna getcha!
Fuck are you?
Fuck.
[yelling] Mate?
Mate, I'm fucking serious!
Call out now if you can hear me.
Mate!
Hey, where are you? Mate!
-Mate! -[son] I'm here!
-What are you doing out here? -You said hide.
You cannot come out here.
You don't go out here. What did I say?
-Come here. -You told me to hide.
What did I say? You don't go outside. Get in the house.
Fucking feel this, cunt.
Feel the wind in me hair.
I can feel the wind in me hair.
[Mark] What is this fuckin' person doing?
What's the matter with you, you fuck?
[Henry] Get out there, you fuckin' idiot.
What the fucking matter with you? [yelling] Oi! Get the fuck out!
-[honking] -Fuckin' drive, cunt!
Fuck! -[car horn blaring] -Fuck.
Fuckin' hell.
-[keypad beeping] -Fuck.
-[dispatcher] Police, fire or ambulance? -[Mark] Ambulance.
What's the situation there, sir? Can you describe it for me?
-Uh, car crash. -[car horn stops]
Uh, corner of Ellery and… Fuck, I don't know.
All right, sir.
Can I have your name and a contact number please?
-Fuck. -[cell phone beeps]
-Henry! -[Henry] Sit down here. Sit down.
Yeah.
Henry, come on. We've got to go.
[yells] Henry!
Do you want to come up to the house?
No, no, no.
They're… they're putting the final pieces in place to fly us across to Victoria.
-What? -What's that noise?
They're putting the final--
I've never been to Victoria. [chuckles]
[clicks tongue] Okay, I'm just gonna need you to lay low.
[hesitates] That's all… I'm fuckin' tired, man.
All right? I'll call you later with the details, okay?
No, no.
I'm just fuckin' with you.
I know. I know.
[therapist] Are you, um, dealing with any increased irritability?
-Stress? -[Mark] Nah.
[therapist] Nothing that you've perceived in yourself?
[Mark] No.
[therapist] Okay.
Any physical discomfort, anything likewise?
[Mark] No.
[therapist] Any symptoms of depression?
[Mark] No.
[therapist] How about anxiety?
-Are you feeling anxious? -No. No.
And, um, how about any… any thoughts of self-harm?
No.
Look, um, I do have, um, it noted
that you are dealing with some sleep issues.
Might it be linked to your work with WA Police,
or is that more personal?
Nah.
More to do with WA Police or more personal?
Neither.
Mark, look, the reason that you're here
is I've been told you're being placed in a difficult work situation.
I've been asked to discuss that with you.
You know, a person in this profession
goes through enough… goes through enough trauma that the aggregation of that trauma,
-the amount of it, is overwhelming. -Mm-hmm.
There's not always an isolated incident
or a situation that--
I don't know what you're talking about.
If you need to take some time off work,
there will be other people that can take your shifts.
Look, I need to talk to you about the other night
outside the front of my house.
-Uh, no, Henry, listen-- -No, Mark, please.
I used to watch a lot of porn, you know?
Uh, amputees.
That was my thing.
You know, people with no… no arms, no fuckin' legs. [chuckles]
I don't know what it is about you, Mark.
You… you remind me of an amputee.
You keep talking like that,
[chuckles] I'll have to take you down to the fuckin' watchhouse.
What was that?
[yells] I've got a black lake in my eye!
[man] You need to know that I've told them that we cannot replace you.
You've been on for five and a half months.
We can't replicate that and we can't undo that work.
[smacks lips] Flying you down to Melbourne in the coming days.
Victoria are providing coverts.
That'll take the pressure off.
[Rylett] We've heard nothing about the assault in the NT
and Forensics have come back with the test results from his vehicle.
The tape lifts they took were never tested.
They were submitted to the lab where they were set aside.
They tested them yesterday.
Testing confirms no physical evidence
of any other presence in the fucking vehicle.
-Sorry. -It's all right.
They noted that this, in and of itself, is not conclusive
and that at the time the tape lifts were taken
the person of interest was compliant,
cooperative and understanding of the process.
We have absolutely nothing on him.
[Mark] How's, uh… How's your mum?
She said to not talk about it.
Talk about what?
How she is.
-[Mark] Hey, mate. -Yeah?
[sniffles] I'm not gonna be able to take you for a few days, okay?
Okay.
-So you tell your mum? -Okay.
[Ikin] There's a boy out there.
Alone.
[sighs] Waiting to be found.
And you know what he's saying?
"Where am I?" "Where am I?"
"Where the fuck am I?"
[man 1] Henry.
I heard this is your first time in Victoria.
Must've done something right to be sent interstate.
We're making a collection from a contact.
You're taking it back with you to WA, that's why you're here.
Mark.
Mark!
John's here in town.
Take this.
-You wait here. -[man 2] Hey, Mark.
-Follow me through here. -[car door closes]
What the fuck's happened to this shit?
-[door closes] -Through here, mate. You all right?
[Mark] Yep.
Victoria have provided John.
He'll be leading the final part of the operation.
But my concern is that he's too direct for Henry.
I need you to talk to him about Henry's anxiety.
So we've gone after him and we're racing down this corridor
and he's locked himself in so we thought, "Well, all right."
"Wait for you to ask to be nicely let out."
-[man 1 laughs] -[man 2] John.
-Do you have a minute? -Yeah.
Uh, Mark here's been leading the operation in WA.
Be good to talk to him about--
Sorry, what was your name again?
Mark.
Yeah, but that's not your actual name, is it?
I mean they did tell you not to use your actual name?
Yeah.
So what's your real name?
What's your name?
-Well, it's not Mark. That's taken. -[men laughing]
Sorry. I'm just fucking around with you. I'm sorry.
I'll be with you in a sec. I've just got to…
So…
He's a fuckin' arsehole.
We picked him up, take him down the hallway…
We've been taking out insurance policies, putting it through our claims officer.
Which puts it in our system…
[whispering] Mark.
What do you reckon is in the case?
You just have to trust him.
[man 1] Where is my water? Where's my water? Where is my water?
[yells] Bloody hell!
No, no, no, no!
-It's him. -[Henry] Who?
John.
-You all right, Mark? -[Mark] Yeah.
-Flight sorted? -[Mark] Yep.
How are you, Henry?
Yeah.
It's really… nice to meet you, John, yeah. Thanks--
I'm not John.
He's over there.
He wants you to write down your name and date of birth.
He said to write down your other name.
-My other name? -[man 2] Yeah. Your other name.
-I changed the name years ago. -Why didn't you fuckin' tell me?
What's he want to know the name for?
Why didn't you fuckin' tell me?
[man 3] They'll give your name to a police contact,
run a background check on you.
We all have to get cleared. Make sure we won't draw attention.
[man 4] Yeah, yeah, don't fuckin' worry about it.
I remember sitting where you are,
thinking I'd never be let in with the shit I'd done.
-John wants to see you. -What?
John. He wants to talk to you now.
I heard about you. Henry.
Whatever your name is.
You've got to be honest with us, all right?
[Henry] I-- Yeah.
I changed… I changed the name years--
I don't give a fuck.
No.
-What are you staring at? -Nothin'.
Then why are you still standing there?
Thanks.
Right. They've got us in different places. Don't leave the hotel.
There's nothing else I haven't told you, apart from the name.
-Nothing else I know about, at least. -All right.
Don't leave the hotel, Henry.
[Henry] I met this woman down in the hotel bar last night.
Brought her back to the room.
You know what she told me before she left?
[Henry] "I'll never forget you, Henry."
Fuckin' hope they've got enough ink in the printer to print out my record.
Eh, you don't need to worry about it.
Ah, there's been nothing in 20 years, mate.
[Rylett] There were no records of an assault in the NT under Henry Teague.
They were filed under his former name, Peter Morley.
I provided them with the information,
but it was misfiled.
Jesus Christ.
[Henry's voicemail] I can't, uh, take your call at the moment.
If you leave me a message, I'll endeavor to call you back later.
[Mark] Henry?
Fuck.
-I've lost him. -[man on phone] What?
-[Mark] I've fuckin' lost him. -Did he follow you back?
Uh, no, I don't know, but I don't think so.
Fuck!
Uh… Listen, Mark.
We can't put out an alert. You know that.
There… there can't be a follow vehicle.
I can't put out an alert. You have to try and find him.
What?
You're gonna have to try to find him, mate.
[Rylett] Only issue is the alibi.
Her daughter worked at a local RSL at the time of the abduction.
She said her mum was often there, playing the machines.
[Ikin] Don't have security camera footage dating back to 2002?
Not back that far.
Do you keep records of your sign-in books?
If she was a regular, she wouldn't have to sign.
What do you do for the regulars?
We used to have a loyalty program
where members could scan their cards
and the machine would record their numbers.
How would we track down--
Sorry.
[man on PA system] They shall not grow old, as we who are left grow old.
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun and in the morning,
we shall remember them.
We shall remember them.
-We shall remember them. -We shall remember them.
-[man on PA system] Lest we forget. -We'll have her number on file,
-but the machines have been out of use-- -Where are they?
[manager] What's the date you're after?
The 12th May, 2002.
[Henry on recorder] I'm sittin' here with the missus and just had ourselves a roast.
She says hello, by the way.
"Hello, Mark," she's saying, "Hello, Mark." [chuckles]
[Mark] Tell her I-- Tell her I said hi.
Mate, where-- Where are you?
-Are you okay? -[Henry] Yeah.
I had to head out of town for a while.
[Mark] Well, why don't I talk to the boys, we'll work out--
Yeah, he's anxious. He's unsettled.
At this point, we feel that we could lose him… at any time.
We need to get John out here
and prepare to make the final push.
[Gary] The interstate job was in preparation for a larger shipment.
Mark, here, has put you forward for this, Henry.
And this is just the start, mate.
This is nothing. This is just a fuckin' run.
It's a remote airfield, hour-and-a-half out of town.
John's concerned about security and we need you to case the site.
When the delivery is made, you'll take 10% of the profit.
To be clear, Henry, that's over $100,000 each.
I've been, uh, doing the security down here
for nearly five years and, uh, it never gets old.
We're open to the public on Sundays, by the way.
Oh, right, yeah. I might bring my boys out.
Yeah, you should. They'd enjoy it.
You like the look of that, eh? You want to sit in the front seat?
I was 54 when I started. I learned with my son.
I had a fear of heights, but, uh, when you get in here,
it feels really safe.
-Yeah. -[softly] It feels very safe.
It does feel safe.
How much are these worth?
Well, there's, uh, no ceiling in the price of planes
but, uh, that, um… that plane back there,
that's, uh, $60,000.
[Rylett] We've disproved his alibi.
She was on the machines at the local RSL.
He couldn't have been with her at the time.
[officer] Where was he then?
Not… not there.
Have you seen the records from the NT?
I'm reading them.
Follow me, please.
Take a seat. There's fine.
I'm Detective Sergeant Cross.
I'm the controller for the Covert and Specialist Operations crew.
I'm here to inform you that at the close of the coronial inquest
there'll be a UC sitting next to your person of interest -on his return to WA. This is Paul Emery. -[door opens]
-on his return to WA. This is Paul Emery. -[door opens]
-[Paul] Hey. -Hi.
[Cross] The intention will be for Paul to make contact
with the POI on his return trip,
see where that takes us over a two-week period.
I'm afraid, unless they decide to take it further, that's…
That's it.
You're here to brief us about his background.
-Right. But he did it. -[Ikin] Mm.
And I know they've probably told you he isn't worth the effort,
but he did it.
[Cross] Well, we've only just been allocated this.
Tell us what we can use to get him to talk.
[Rylett on phone] Is this Peter Morley?
[Henry] No.
Is this Peter Morley, otherwise known as Henry Peter Teague?
Who's this?
My name's Kate Rylett.
I'm a detective senior constable in Queensland.
As the detectives would've informed you,
you've been summonsed to appear at a coronial inquest in Queensland…
[man] Henry Teague.
[Rylett] …into the suspected abduction and murder of James Liston in 2002.
I'm going to give you my phone number.
I'll be your point of contact from here on.
[Henry] And what if I refuse to come?
[Rylett] If you don't want to come,
the Queensland coroner will issue a warrant
for you to be taken into custody and brought before the inquest.
After the inquest, we'll provide you with transport,
as I understand that you currently live in Western Australia.
We'll ensure you're returned to your place of residence,
assuming you aren't required to remain in Queensland
at the close of the process.
[John] We've reviewed the brief of evidence prepared by Detective Rylett.
[man 1 at door] Paul Emery?
[man 2] And we can see reason to invest WA Pol resources
in your person of interest.
You'll remain here as a controller, work with us on this.
We're initiating an operation that would mean introducing Mark here
as part of a criminal organization that can relocate people, erase histories…
…offer him a way out.
[Henry] It's dark.
I step out the front of my house.
And I get this feeling of lightness come over me.
So I start to run.
And then I'm up in the air
and I'm flying over the back fences and the houses that I grew up in.
Fixed-wing licence costs $10,000.
Two $5,000 payments. Hey, figure how useful I'd be, Mark.
-[cell phone vibrating] -I-- I could be landing on airstrips
all over the country, you know, making deliveries.
Yeah?
All right. We'll head over to the airfield after that.
We're going to go meet him out of town.
Henry.
Mark.
-All right? -Yeah, good.
There's a car to be ditched. Police have eyes on it.
Make sure it's not parked where it is.
I'll send you the details.
Henry, there's, um… I don't know if you're aware of this,
Henry, there's, um… I don't know if you're aware of this, but there's a subpoena that's been issued for you.
Nah.
[man] Yeah. Queensland Coroners Court.
Are you aware of that?
No, that's done. I went through that.
No. This is different.
Another inquest, is it?
Yeah, apparently they have some new information.
-Can't let you hold on to that. -Yep.
Thanks.
-[Mark] Is that it? -[man] Yeah, that's it.
What was that about?
[Henry] Uh… I was in the same area when this person went missing.
Police harassed me for it at the time. Nothing came of it, so…
How many times have I told you--
If I'd known there could've been another subpoena, I would've told you.
What?
Yeah. I am.
What?
Now?
All right.
Yeah, fuckin' all right. I'm doing it now.
-[cell phone beeps] -What is it?
I've got to turn around.
Why?
The airfield is, uh, not on tonight.
John's in town.
We're gonna go, um… We're gonna go see him.
It's probably about the airfield.
Could be about the inquest.
It could be about the inquest.
I really don't fuckin' know.
Okay. Well done. And I'll give you a call this afternoon.
-All right. Take care. -Hey.
-Hey. -Hey, hey.
-How you doin'? -Good, good.
-Uh, Henry, John. John, Henry. -Yeah.
-Good? -You remember Henry?
-All good? -Yep.
-All right -Cool.
-Take a seat. -[Mark] Yep.
Yeah. Grab yourself a seat. There, there.
Park yourself up the end there, Henry.
So, I, uh, actually need to
talk to you about this inquest that you've heard told of…
Heard tell of.
I just need to… to sort that out.
Yeah, uh…
Got a criminal history.
Stealing, uh, bit of violence.
Fuckin' hell.
-[high-pitched ringing] -Uh…Hey, uh, let me…
-Yeah, John, let me… -Fuck's sake.
Yeah, I'll sort it out. Hold on.
I've got it.
I… I did time for the violence, you know?
I was upfront with Mark about that.
-Wasn't I, mate? -Yeah, absolutely.
[Henry] And I was questioned about the other thing at the time.
[Mark] There we are.
[Henry] Nothing came of it.
[Mark] Sorry about that.
Excuse us a minute.
[Henry] Where's he gone?
[Mark] I don't know.
I'm gonna go
see what's going on.
John.
You okay, mate?
Wait outside. Wait in the hall. I'll call you later.
Hey, we're, um…
-I should-- I should be here. -Mark. Fuck off.
Yeah. Yep.
Yeah, all right, then. Um…
I'll see what he says. I'll give him a call then.
I'll be right back.
[whispering] Fuck! Fuck!
What's going on?
He's fuckin' falling to pieces in there. Fuck! -[door closes] -Fuck. Hey, hey.
-[door closes] -Fuck. Hey, hey.
-[John on headphones] …who tell me… -Fuck. -…that you're the one who's responsible… -Fuck.
…so you have to tell me what we need to take care of.
[Henry] Nothin' to tell.
Okay. What falls on you falls on all of us.
All right?
So I received information this morning
that says you're the one… who's done it.
And I-- I don't care what you've done,
whether you done him or killed him or what have you.
I mean, there's… there's nothing you can tell me that's gonna upset me.
What I care about is being lied to.
I'm not lying.
You've had every opportunity to be upfront with us.
And if you're gonna…
be dishonest in front of me and say you had nothin' to do with it,
-that's not what I've heard. -Yeah.
And I'd have no choice but to cut you out and you'd be back to nothing.
Yeah.
And if they put you away for this, there's nothin' I can do.
And there's a… There's a stigma, there's a…
there's a… a stigma about this kind of thing inside.
So, you know, I can create alibis,
clear the site, remove evidence, relocate you.
I mean, you've seen that.
[softly] All right.
Sorry. Henry, what was that?
I killed him. I killed the boy.
-[officer] Jesus Christ. Fuck yes! -[muffled clapping]
-[shushes] -[John] Well, you know,
you're gonna have to take me through it
'cause we need to know what we have to take care of.
I saw him waiting at the underpass,
so I pulled the car over, and started to chat to him for a while
and I talked him into the car.
Cops have taken the car, searched it,
came back with nothin'.
They haven't found the body, obviously.
[John] And where did this happen?
What happened?
John said we've got to go and fuckin'
wait there in my fuckin' car.
What? What is it?
Nothin'. I don't know. Fuck. Uh…
Just put the work on hold for a while or something, um,
while he sorts a few things out.
-You told him about the airfield? -Yeah.
Look, I don't know how much I can tell you, man, all right?
[Ikin] He was dead before anyone knew he was missing.
Before the police were called.
Before his family even started looking, he was dead.
Detectives will regroup in Queensland to determine if arrest will be made.
The undercover operation will continue with Detective Sergeant Cross
to return the suspect to the scene of the offence.
The site itself will need to be contained in preparation for a search for evidence.
[Cross] Henry, I'm what's referred to as a cleaner.
The organization's brought me in to ensure the police can find nothing
that could be brought against you at this new inquest.
So talk me through it all and I'll decide the right course for us.
[Henry] I read all the press and reports and that.
It wasn't a black car, it wasn't two… two men.
I was on me own.
I didn't park at the overpass, I parked behind it at my old church.
It happened in an old demountable.
So here, it's, uh, about an hour and a half north of the city, out in the mountains.
-It was an old forestry site. -Where is the demountable?
Uh, they took it away when… when they closed the site.
There's nothin' in it, so--
[Cross] Couldn't there be traces in there?
No.
All right.
Well, what happened after he, um…
after he died?
I took him out a bit further, you know, covered him up with grass, branches,
that sort of thing.
Left him there, went back about a week or two later and he was almost gone.
What do you mean?
There were just little pieces of him.
No. No, we have to find everything.
What about his clothes?
I threw them in the creek.
-[Cross] How long ago was this? -About eight years now.
[Mark] Why did you take his clothes off?
I don't know, Mark.
I suppose you had to get rid of 'em.
[Cross] What have you done then?
I went home.
How'd you do it?
-How do you mean? -[Cross] How'd you kill him?
-I put my arm around his neck. -[Cross] Right. Show us on Mark.
Mark, can you just pop yourself down and we'll take a look at that.
All right. Yeah. It doesn't matter.
-You all right? -[chuckles] Yeah.
Yeah.
-[Cross] You need to take us there. -Yeah.
-[Cross] Need to clear everything. -Can Mark come?
-[Cross] Need to clear everything. -Can Mark come? -[Cross] Yeah. -Ah.
[Mark] It doesn't matter where we sit as long as we're fuckin' together.
Like, you know, the same fuckin' row.
So the flight is sorted.
Uh, well, he'll call me in five but I'm gonna go sort the car out.
Hey.
Henry.
Um, I'm gonna…
Mate, I'm… I'm… Come here.
Come here, mate. Fuck. [chuckling] I'm just…
I'm so proud of you, brother.
Yeah.
[Rylett] This briefing has been called to determine
[Rylett] This briefing has been called to determine whether an arrest should be made of Peter Morley,
otherwise known as Henry Peter Teague,
in the abduction and murder of James Liston,
eight years ago on the 12th of May, 2002.
As you're all aware,
this is the largest missing-persons case in the history of our state
and is one of the largest in the history of our country. -[seat belt clicks] -I'm going to the bathroom.
-[seat belt clicks] -I'm going to the bathroom.
[Rylett] The investigation has spanned over eight years
and is one of the largest joint operations
ever undertaken by interstate agencies.
Peter Morley was born to a normal, middle-class military family.
There is no evidence to suggest as a child Peter Morley was the subject of abuse.
This investigation has completely disproved Morley's alibi…
[Mark] He's just gone to the bathroom.
[Rylett] …and has unearthed the full details
of his previous assault of a child in the Northern Territory
for which he served two years in jail.
Lights, please.
This child was taken from a family crisis center in the NT in 1996.
He was not known to the offender.
Attending doctors observed that the child
had lacerations and abrasions to his legs, arms and torso.
His hair, face and body were covered in dirt,
with blood present in the nose and mouth.
He had blackened eyes,
several closed fractures,
a collapsed lung,
severe bruises beneath his hairline,
and deep cuts to his scalp and genitalia.
The overall pattern indicated widespread and repeated applications
of both blunt and sharp-force trauma.
Contusions to the throat
in association with hemorrhaging in the eyes
was indicative of suffocation.
He was found barely alive in the remnants of a burnt-out car
less than 100 meters from where he was taken.
On returning to the site of the abduction,
Peter Morley offered to lead the search for the person responsible.
-[knocking on door] -[flight attendant] Hello?
-Are you okay? -[Henry] I'm fine.
-[flight attendant] Sorry. -Nah.
Thought you'd fallen in.
I can't fuckin' breathe, man. I can't fuckin' breathe.
-Yeah, you can. -Nah. Yeah, you can.
Ready? [inhales deeply]
[officer] I want to raise a few issues here.
Regardless of his assault on this other child,
in this case, the timelines are thin,
even with the break in his alibi.
We're talking about an hour to abduct a person--
I have to be clear, this is a practiced offender
-who's placed himself at the scene-- -You've been clear.
-You've had your time. Now sit down. -I want to clarify something.
Let's have some contention in the process.
I want to clarify something. The duration of the assault in the NT?
Fifteen minutes.
[Henry] There's never been anyone locked up in Queensland without a body.
New South Wales there has. Not here.
I, um… I mentioned the yard where you talked about shredding the cars.
Is that somewhere that we should head to?
-[Henry] Nah, mate. -I just thought maybe--
No, Mark, no.
What were you wearing on the day?
I threw it all on the fire, burnt it all, shoes as well.
-[Cross] There's nothing left? -Nothing left. Nothing.
-[Cross] Where are the ashes? -I threw them out on the lawn
and then I got the dirt ripped up and taken away, so…
[chuckles] Fuckin' well done.
[chuckles] That's gold. Fuckin' gold.
I didn't mean to do it, though. I didn't know it would happen.
It's like how the words are coming out of me mouth now,
like how I'm saying it to you now, like it's nothing.
-[Cross] How far from here? -[Henry] Not far.
That's my old church there.
That's where I was married.
Don't know what I was fuckin' thinkin' of at the time. [chuckles]
-This is where I picked him up, here. -[indicator clicking]
No, don't fuckin' pull over. There's a camera there.
There's a camera there, mate.
Just keep going.
[officer 1] This isn't about whether he did it.
It's about whether or not it's prosecutable.
And you can talk about an unsolicited confession all you like.
This undercover operation induces a suspect to confess.
It's inducement without evidence.
[Henry] This is where I threw his clothes.
[Mark] There's nothing here.
That's good.
I strongly submit that we continue the covert operation
while the area's being searched
because if you go for an arrest without evidence
and you find nothing, he walks.
I refuse to put the victim's family through that for nothing.
As you're aware, the commissioner has tasked me
with making a decision as to whether or not an arrest is to take place.
Without evidence, he walks.
[officer 2] And that will be my decision to make.
[Henry] Just pull in up there.
[Cross] Is this it?
Yep.
[Cross] So this is where the demountable was?
-Yeah. -[Cross] So you killed him in there…
and you dragged him down where?
I don't remember that water being there.
It was here though.
Here.
You sure?
Yeah, there's nothing.
[Cross] It's all right. It's all right.
[officer yelling] Hold it there! Hold it there!
Stay where you are, mate! Just stay where you are!
Thank you all for your attendance.
I'll let you know at the outset that we won't be able to answer any questions.
I can confirm that earlier today, an arrest was made
in relation to the disappearance of James Liston on May 12, 2002.
Police are currently securing a large area in anticipation of an extensive search.
The search area itself is located in the Queensland floodplain.
The issue that we are facing is that flooding over the past eight years
may have removed any remaining evidence.
[John] Henry Teague.
As informed earlier,
you're here under arrest with regard to the abduction of James Liston
on the 12th May, 2002.
I haven't done this, you know. Nothin' to do with me, mate.
As long as you didn't do it, there'll be no evidence
and you've got nothing to worry about.
Now, you got a minute. Anything you need?
Anyone got a smoke?
[Rylett] We'll be undertaking a basic search of the forest covering.
We have around four acres to manage.
Additional Forensics are searching the demountable
which was relocated when the site sold
and where it's alleged that the victim was killed.
Don't disturb potential evidence.
If you come across anything, pause and raise your hand.
-[Cross] How we looking? -[forensic coordinator] Found nothing.
-Nothing at all? -No.
The divers have finished with the lake, but no, nothing. [Cross] Right.
[Mark] No, hold on.
It's night.
I'm in my house.
My son is asleep in his room.
And I hear a voice.
It's coming from downstairs.
I walk toward it.
I can barely breathe.
It's not a person talking.
It's a tape recorder.
I press the button to turn it off.
But when I turn it off…
I went through some hard times. I quit my job at the ferry company.
With the pandemic and all, I've spent almost two years at home.
What are you waiting for to be the hero of your own life?
Take a look at yourself from above. How big are you?
I'm so bored. I was fine on the ferry.
Some people get seasick. I guess I get landsick.
People have been wearing masks. It's uncomfortable, but I got used to it.
I'm tired of sitting around at home.
You gotta listen to yourself and take care of your body in such times.
There is a lady called Peri Sönmez on Instagram. Her account is PeriWords.
I especially like two of her videos.
"Forgive Yourself, Adapt, and Accept" and "Toxic Relationships? Never."
I find them really helpful.
Now, there is no one toxic in my life.
GUIDE TO HAPPINESS I no longer talk to my friends Salih and Bahri from the ferry.
Toxic means poisonous. It's simple.
You stop talking to people who aren't good for you.
It reminds me of what Uncle Enver always says.
"Wipe your ass with glass, you'll get cut. Talk to simpletons, you'll lose it."
I'm choosing to avoid people now. I'm happy in my small world.
I just want to do good things for myself now.
I'm sick of making others happy. LETITGOXINE That about sums it up.
Yes, that about sums it up.
Fine, you can start Monday night.
Thanks.
Alright, let's see how big you are
when you put yourself in the center.
Start if you are ready to adapt.
Just take a deep breath.
One.
Take a deeper breath.
And say it.
-I… -I…
-…accept myself. -…accept myself.
Can you feel yourself adapting?
-I'm unique. -I'm unique.
-I'm unique. -I'm unique.
Just say, "I accept and approve of myself." INCOMING CALL FOREMAN SALIH
-I accept and approve of myself. -I accept and approve of myself.
When will you leave? Don't be late on your first day.
Mom, it's a night job. Get out, please. I'm watching a video.
Why are you taking deep breaths like that?
-Am I not allowed to breathe? -You keep moaning.
I don't like the way you've been acting, Metin.
You don't take care of yourself.
What is with you talking to yourself?
-I'm talking to myself? -Ask yourself the following question.
Go on. Why are your teeth like that after all these months?
They will be fixed soon.
It's a terrible time for this. What if you get engaged?
Look, think hard about Suhal.
Her father helped you out from over there, may God bless him.
They are trying to do you a favor.
The job is fine, but I am not so sure about marriage.
This girl is just right for our family.
What would be the harm in meeting the girl?
I don't like being told what to do.
But he helped you! Nothing is ever good enough for you.
Remember, only you can set your boundaries.
You need just one thing to become a better version of yourself.
-What is it? -Yourself.
She said, "Yourself." Not, "Your mom."
Fine!
KOMODOR HOTEL
-Here is the laundry room. -Yes, sir.
If you need to get a towel or a sheet, they are here.
-Yes, sir. -The girl will be here till the morning.
Have a good one.
Hello.
-Why are you playing with it? -The band broke.
So what? Let's go.
That's it.
Don't walk around the rooms.
If a guest arrives, take water to their room.
If they want anything else, get it from the liquor store next door.
Your weekly pay is 1,500 liras.
That's all. Here.
It's supposed to be Metin. It says Çetin.
It says Çetin?
This is your probation week, anyway.
There is a tip box there.
The guests will sometimes give you 10, 20, or 100 liras.
-Will you put it in the box? -I will.
You will, my ass.
So, 1,500 liras per week is enough.
If it's the rule, I will.
Steal it if you want, my man. I couldn't care less.
Back on the ship, we used to collect tips in a box.
And we'd share them. Tip box.
We aren't on the ship anymore. We've docked. We are on land now.
I can't keep tabs on your tips. Do as you please.
You can all fight about it if you want. I don't care.
Yes, sir.
Don't wander around the halls. Don't eavesdrop on the rooms.
What's the profile of our guests, sir?
They are all upper-crust.
-Good evening, Mr. Bahtiyar. -Good evening.
Give him room 103.
Any new songs? We listened to you all night the other day.
No, sir. Sorry, no songs tonight.
Can you bring me some water?
Mr. Çetin will.
I'm off.
Hacer will come at 7:00 a.m. Open the door for her if you lock it.
How will I recognize Hacer?
She'll say, "I'm Hacer." Who else would come at 7:00?
She is short.
Give me your number.
Mr. Cengiz, at a time when I'm turning over a new leaf,
thank you so much for your help.
Thank the girl. This is just probation, anyway.
But you are trusting me with an entire hotel, after all.
What's the worst you can do? Eat the walls?
Nibble on the couches? What?
Do you have any suggestions on smiling?
Smile. Always smile.
The first step is important.
When you are starting a new adventure,
be sure to show everyone that you are ready to be your best version.
You have prepared your body and your mind.
Now, you are ready.
Look, your eyes are bright, and you are glowing.
You are as light as a feather and as strong as an oak.
You don't get hurt, no matter what.
-Give me your Peri word. -I give you my Peri word.
NO ENTRY WITHOUT A FACE MASK!
Suhal?
I'm Mr. Metin. I mean, Metin.
Good evening. How are you?
I'm fine. Welcome.
Do you need something?
I've started working at the reception.
Well, congratulations.
Thanks.
-Are these machines automatic? -Yes, they have timers. Programs, I mean.
Incredible technology.
Maybe I should say, "One day, the robots will take over the world!"
My teeth will be fixed soon. The pandemic delayed the treatment.
Okay.
I haven't seen you before. Your mom… You know Kezban?
Mrs. Kezban… I mean, I don't know your mom.
But Nabi is her neighbor.
Is she your aunt?
-I know Nadi, the youngest brother. -I'm his daughter.
I used to work on ships.
Ships?
"Don't let people define you."
"Look them in the eye and scream out who you are."
There was a video…
Ships… I worked on ships.
Ships? All the ships?
No, I mean…
The Queen Elizabeth.
Cruise ship. Overseas.
Not a ferry?
We do internships on ferries for a year. Then we go abroad.
-Can I be honest with you? -Sure.
I know our mothers talked about our marriage, but…
Maybe we should…
Can we not talk about that? I need to dry the sheets.
Of course.
Mr. Çetin!
I'm coming!
Mr. Metin or Mr. Çetin?
It's a typo.
It's actually Ayzek.
Maybe you remember the old TV show The Love Boat. It's from there.
Okay, when you decide on a name, I'll call you that.
-Alright. I'll be upstairs. -I'll be downstairs.
I didn't mean that…
Mr. Çetin?
He is still calling me Çetin, even though it's a typo.
See you around.
-Mr. Çetin! -It's Metin, sir. Metin.
They got it wrong because I'm new.
I got my water. You were going to get it, but you didn't.
I'm sorry. Could you put your mask on?
-What? -Your mask, sir. Like I'm wearing now.
I don't wear masks. Feel free to wear yours.
Let me note down the water.
I didn't get the jab, but I also didn't get Covid.
I got the jab, and I didn't get Covid.
Maybe I wanna die.
Sir, can you stand further away, please?
Get me 400 grams of salted peanuts, six beers, and a razor blade.
I suppose you have kettles and water here. I also need something like a washtub.
What is something like a washtub?
A washtub.
Yes. Six beers, salted peanuts, and a razor.
-No, a razor blade. Like in a box? -With moveable blades?
No, just a razor blade. Bring them and charge them to my room.
LETITGOXINE
Mom?
Were you asleep?
Look…
You think this girl and I are suitable?
Are you all kidding me? Are you kidding me?
Do you realize how pretty she is? You think we're suitable?
Why not?
Alright. Stop doing things without asking me.
It won't happen. She is too pretty, Mom.
Okay, go to bed. I apologize, sir.
-This is Komodor Hotel, right? -Yes, sir.
-This is Komodor Hotel, right? -Yes, sir. Excuse me.
I'm a single person, you know. I'll leave in the morning.
How do we do it, man? How much is a room?
A single room is 200 liras.
Right, 200 liras.
Here you go.
Can I get your ID, sir?
Here's what happened. I came here by coincidence.
I'm coming from another city. I have a long road ahead.
Please make it work without an ID.
Here.
Take this. You know, it's for you.
But we have a logbook, sir.
Leave me out of it.
You'll be doing me a favor, brother.
But it's too much.
Okay, let's put it here then.
Just a sec.
-Okay, take it. -Huh?
-Take it all for yourself. -But it's 600 liras.
-Where are you from, my man? -From here.
Well…
Can you wear your mask?
It seems to be the new thing. People are wearing masks in their cars.
But it helped me. I got released, you know.
They released me because of corona. I'm so relieved.
Even I can't understand myself.
-Can I remove my mask? -Sure.
They released you? Who?
I was in prison, you know. I got released 'cause of corona.
So, just one night?
Yes, one night.
Room 104.
Thanks. You're the best. You're a good guy.
I try to be. I'm on probation tonight as the night manager.
Thanks.
I parked my car across the road.
-Your car? -Yes.
I'll keep an eye on it.
-Thanks for the water. -You're welcome.
-The room is upstairs? -Yes, and I'm down here.
-Thanks. -Thanks.
No. No, darling, no. It's all my fault, I agree.
You guys handled it perfectly, but I failed.
Yes. Where are you?
I hear some awful music. Like what you listen to when I'm gone.
Darling, I didn't call because I didn't want to argue.
Nothing, right. I want nothing.
Nothing.
It's all my fault. My fault.
Darling Dora, I admit I'm a difficult person.
Okay? Good night.
What? Huh?
No, you…
I didn't call you. You called me. Please don't call again, okay?
What? I'm nowhere!
Everything has a consequence, right? For sure.
Sir, the liquor store made me pay in cash. Could you repay me the 270 liras?
I was thinking about the awful music, sorry.
-You got the razor blade? -Yes, sir.
Okay.
Regarding the money…
Can I pay you tomorrow?
Can I be honest?
I made a decision. I have to express myself correctly.
I believe you'll understand, but can I tell you what I think?
Go on.
Sir, I'll be really upset if you don't pay me back the 270 liras.
Please don't take offense.
If I bottle it up, it will just turn into bad energy for me.
Don't worry. We will settle it tomorrow, Mr. Metin.
You can call me Ayzek.
Sir, I was a sailor. So I'm a good judge of character.
Sorry for being direct.
-You're a good judge of character. -Yes. 270.
I'm on probation tonight, so I don't wanna worry about it. Good night.
Is it the Ayzek from The Love Boat?
It is, sir. But the boat is gone now, and only the love remains.
We are on land now, Mr. Bahtiyar.
Anyone can be a hotshot on land, but the seas are hard.
The seas make you a man.
It takes balls to be at sea. Excuse me.
I'm a bit direct because of my past as a sailor.
Again, I apologize.
You made me laugh. Don't forget the washtub.
You'll shave.
You'll go on a bender with the beers I bought?
If you screw me over, I'll screw you over. You weasel.
-There you are! My man. -Yes, sir?
Can I find anything to eat around here?
You can find some cookies in the liquor store.
And there, a guy sells chickpeas and rice.
Good, I'll check that out. Can I bring you some too?
I don't eat this late, sir. I just eat some almonds and goji berries.
-You do? -I don't eat acidic foods.
They say the bowels are the body's second brain.
Fine, I'll look for some offal.
He is a decent human being. A decent man.
He asks if I also wanna eat.
-Welcome, Mr. Captain. -I'm not a captain.
I'm doing hospitality. Food and beverage. F&B.
Mate tea?
Thanks.
What are you doing? Drawing?
-Can I see? -Sure.
I see. So it's like children's drawings?
I'm just drawing away.
-To pass the time? -No, I have an exam coming up.
A community center class?
-Higher education. Mimar Sinan. -Oh, Mimar… In Fındıklı.
-Universities are hard. -I'm just studying to hopefully enter.
-What are you listening to? -Aşkın Nur Yengi.
Oh, right.
Aşkın Nur Yengi.
Her older sister lived in Kızıltoprak.
She was doing… I remember, look.
Anyway, I shouldn't distract you.
Draw me sometime. Do you do it by looking or from memory?
I mean, you can do both.
-Do you have something like a washtub? -I have a washtub.
Good. Mr. Bahtiyar asked for one. I'll take it upstairs.
Draw me sometime. From memory.
I have so much ironing to do…
I'm just kidding. I saw a rat pass by.
-Where? -It went that way.
We have rats everywhere.
They are back again.
I'm off.
You're very pretty.
Those who think we are a match are insane. I'm serious, not kidding.
I agree.
-Are you serious or kidding? -I really think they are insane.
I have so many other jokes.
Thanks, good night.
-Man! What can you do for me tonight? -Go away. Don't piss me off.
Alright, no problem. Don't worry, no problem.
Hey, fuck off!
-I parked my car in front of the hotel. -I'm here. It's safe.
I'll eat over here. Do you have any drinks?
-What would you like? -Ayran, soda… Give me anything.
Metin! Come here, Metin!
-God! Sir! -Damn it!
-What did you do? -I cut myself, but I couldn't do it right!
-Sit down. Press on it! -Ambulance!
Don't call the police. It's embarrassing.
-How did you do it? -Razor blade.
You made me buy it!
-Are you lightheaded? -No.
-He had beer. -Is it bad?
No. Love, bring a sheet or something.
I wanted to die, but it's hard. It's not easy!
Okay, calm down.
How could you do such a thing?
-Did the bleeding stop? -It will. You didn't cut deep.
-Do we need to call the police? -No.
I'm the night manager. They'll involve me too.
Tilt your head back.
Press on it, Metin.
-Come, darling. Bring it. -Come on.
Bring it. Thanks.
Press on it.
-Suhal, what happened to your foot? -What about it?
Don't make a fist.
I have to go. I left the iron on.
-I couldn't do it. I bled everywhere. -I'm tying it. Almost done.
I'm sorry about it, guys.
There. Are you okay?
I'm not.
Should we call an ambulance?
No, no need.
It shouldn't get infected.
Whenever you are stuck in a dark thought,
which is what we call "negative frequency,"
imagine yourself running freely in a pasture.
And whisper this to yourself three times,
"I'm valuable."
"I'm valuable."
"I'm valuable."
We all consider ourselves valuable. Right.
Can you get him some bandages and iodine tincture from the pharmacy?
Okay.
Are you in shock? Do you get sick when you see blood?
No.
Have you ever run in a pasture?
I spent my entire childhood running in pastures, you know.
It makes a huge difference, right?
Sure.
Go buy some stuff, and I'll wait with him.
Okay.
Um…
-Good evening. -Good evening.
PHARMACY
Could you wait there for just a second?
I'm coming.
-Let me close this. -Um…
Sorry, um…
Before you close, could you give me
some iodine tincture and bandages for cuts?
I'm not closing. I'm the night pharmacist. Show me your cut.
Are you from the hotel?
Yes, I'm the night manager, but…
There is no emergency. It's for precaution.
For the medicine box?
Okay, then I can give you…
I'll give you hydrogen peroxide.
It's nothing serious.
It's just an antiseptic.
Oh, okay then.
I'm adding iodine tincture and bandages.
What else?
-Cotton balls. -Cotton balls, right.
I'm Metin. I used to work on ships.
It's okay. I'll charge the hotel.
No need.
I'm the night manager.
I'll take care of the bill. How much?
Ninety liras.
Ninety.
What's your name?
Saniye.
My nickname is Ayzek.
From The Love Boat. Maybe you've seen it.
You are an actor? I haven't seen you in anything.
I'll be out soon. Wait for me.
Um…
Because it's like a prison visit. I'm kidding.
See you!
Have a good one.
We are both on night duty.
Saniye.
Saniye would be a better match for me.
There is blood on the sheets and on the carpet near the bed.
Listen, Suhal…
I didn't know about it. Sorry.
Is that so? Really?
Too bad.
I'm sick of everyone having an opinion.
Is there no one with no opinions?
We can cry and feel sad together.
Or we can let go and sing songs.
But no! Everyone has an opinion, and they think it's amazing!
I don't understand how people know so much.
Everyone holds the key and is looking for, excuse my language, a hole to shove it in.
Sir, please don't gesture with your hand.
Gesture?
Don't move it.
Cherry juice. Increases blood production.
It can't increase blood production. Enough, for God's sake.
I'm sorry, Mr. Davut. This whole thing is ridiculous.
It's okay.
Sir, I'm sorry, but such things happen to me as well.
Our lives are similar. We're human.
In those moments when life gets hard,
I say to myself, "Don't worry about it, Ayzek."
"So what? You'll deal with it. What's there to do? Never mind."
So, I take care of it in my head.
I think you should also give the real Bahtiyar inside you a chance.
What are you doing?
Checking if it is wallpaper. It's paint.
In short, listen to yourself, sir.
Agree with yourself. In your brain.
What did I just tell you?
Alright, but it's not just my opinion.
Are you on Instagram?
Do you know the account PeriWords?
It's in her videos. Take a look.
A joyful morning to you, friends.
Hello to the sun, the trees, the birds, the bugs, and the blue sky.
We'll do something different today.
Turn it off, please. I'm not in the mood for it.
It's unbelievable. What's this nonsense, for God's sake?
What's "Hello to the blue sky," Metin?
What, are we in Eurovision?
Right, think about how Gökhan from the band Athena was wronged.
Yet, he didn't give up.
And today, he is still Gökhan from Athena, right?
Without affirmations…
Think about where Gökhan from Athena is as opposed to some of our old artists.
Look, there are thousands of stupid videos like this.
Please don't watch them. They poison you.
We have more doctors than patients. Everyone is a therapist.
Sir, is this your phone ringing? Dora is calling.
Put it down. That phone doesn't concern you.
Sir.
Look.
Your phone looks pristine. And look at mine.
It's a simple equation.
Why would someone with a pristine phone want to die?
No response, right?
Metin, could you find me a rope?
Mr. Bahtiyar, I'll bring you some of my wonderful mate tea.
You'll drink it and sleep like a baby.
And you'll remember what in the morning?
To say hi to the blue sky?
No, to pay my 270 liras, alright?
Look, I'm 50 years old, and my weekly pay is 1,500 liras.
And Mr. Davut will be mad.
So, please.
Nobody can abandon ship when I'm on duty, alright?
Metin, come. I have something important to ask you.
At your service, sir.
Look, I'll pay you to choke me to death.
Please end it, Metin.
Mr. Bahtiyar, I swear I'll call the police.
I'll bring you your mate tea to drink, alright?
-What happened? What did he say? -Well…
He can't think clearly.
But I gave him a good talking-to. He calmed down, and now he'll sleep.
Metin, don't call the police.
I'm here, anyway. Fuck him. Just let him sleep.
These people think dying is like fainting.
Okay, don't call the police. Take this. Put it in your pocket.
-I'll be around too. -Alright. Is he drunk?
He got six beers but only drank about two.
-Take the rest from his room. -Huh?
-Take them from his room. -I'll return them to the liquor store.
-He shouldn't drink. -Okay.
-Go on. -Alright.
What are you doing?
-What's up? -You were just here.
I wanted to exchange these for cold ones, but the store is closed.
-Are you drinking Coke? -Would you like some?
No, Coke is acidic.
I'm on a diet where I only eat six almonds and nothing else after 8:00.
Good luck with that.
-Give me a song. -What?
-Give me a song to play. -I should go to work.
Do you remember the movie where the guy visits his older brother
in the pharmacy warehouse?
-We're like that. -With Mazhar Alanson!
His brother comes and asks if he'd like some ice cream.
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.
What's up, baby? Sorry.
Saniye?
The pharmacist lady. I got gauze bandages and stuff.
What happened to Mr. Bahtiyar?
He was far gone. But I gave him some advice, and he is better.
-You gave Mr. Bahtiyar some advice? -Can't I?
-Wow, that's something. -What do you mean?
Do you know that Mr. Bahtiyar teaches literature?
Really? So I should have done what? Read him a poem?
He is a professor, Mr. Ayzek.
You wanna compare me and him?
I checked out The Love Boat. Why call yourself Ayzek? He is Black.
Think about it.
He is in a bad place.
He quits teaching, starts to make music.
Then corona hits, and he struggles hard for two years.
I think he also has family issues. I saw him here a few times.
What did you watch? The Love Boat is nothing like that.
I'm talking about Mr. Bahtiyar. It seems the pandemic has affected him.
The divorce rate increased during it.
Nobody has money.
-He offered me money. -Who?
Bahtiyar.
For what?
He said, "I'll pay you this much money to kill me."
-Stop joking. -I'm serious.
Don't say things like that to look interesting.
It's true.
How much did he offer?
Not a huge amount.
He owes me 270 liras too. And I couldn't return the beers.
Such high figures!
-Anyway, don't kill him. -Do I look like I would?
Absolutely.
Have you seen Joker?
-No. Is that a compliment? -No.
Why did you smile, then?
I said, "You look like you would," and smiled.
Really?
That's fine, pretty girl.
Works for me. It's okay if you think so.
Don't forget to draw me. Draw my profile to hide my baldness.
God…
Everyone is looking for an adventure.
She says I could kill him!
It's okay if you think so.
Ma'am!
-Hey, what is going on? -What are you doing?
-Ma'am, open the door! -Hey!
-I'm calling the police. -Give me medicine!
-What is going on? -Ms. Saniye!
-Give me just one! -I called the police. Leave.
-Get down! -Fuck off!
-Hey, get down! -Look.
-We are all neighbors! -Stay out of it, Ayzek.
What are you doing? Move!
-Go inside. -Don't talk to him!
-You got a problem? -Who are you?
-You got a problem? -It's a fucking massacre!
-Leave! -No, please.
He'll shout a bit and leave. He is an addict.
Wait. Go in and lock the door.
-The police are on the way. -Okay.
-You got a problem? -Who are you?
Ayzek!
Come here. Talk to me.
-Suhal, go inside. -Come here!
Go in. Lock the door.
-Tell me your problem. -The fucking antichrist is here.
-Piss off! -Please!
-It's okay. -Ayzek!
Stay away from him!
Suhal, get inside!
Suhal, get inside my heart!
Boy, you're pissing me off!
What did you say? I'll slap the hell out of you!
-Mr. Metin! -It's okay.
-He is insane. -What is happening?
They are about to fight.
-Suhal! Get inside my heart! -Go away!
It's fine. Come inside.
Suhal, get inside!
Boy, what did you say?
-Break my teeth! -What? Go away. Don't come here.
They are here.
You can't stop a bad guy.
-I'll fuck you up. -Hey!
He stabbed him. Off he goes.
-I told you to stay away. -It's fine.
Are you okay?
It's fine!
I warned you. Why did you talk to him?
-What happened? -It's fine.
-Çarli stabbed him. -Are you okay? Let's go to the hospital.
No, it's fine. I'm the night manager there.
He was bothering the lady, so I wanted to…
-Çarli? We'll arrest him. -Thanks.
I didn't really do anything.
-Let's check it inside. -Let's go.
You don't need to come.
-God, he stabbed me out of nowhere. -Ayzek?
I knew it would happen.
-Let's go to the hospital. -Ms. Saniye will take care of it.
Go to the hotel. I'll take care of it.
She will.
-God… -Go on.
-God… -They are animals.
Where did he have the knife?
It's a deep wound.
Go in and take off your pants. I'm coming.
My pants…
And I just bought cotton balls and iodine tincture from you!
Go in. I'm coming.
You think it's necessary?
-Lie down, take off your pants. -Well…
-Let me see. -Good God…
If you don't mind…
Your undies too.
There is a lot of blood. I'll clean it now, okay?
I didn't even feel it.
Don't worry, you don't need stitches.
It's fine.
-See, it's fine. -Okay.
All good.
I'm on probation too.
Can I get dressed?
Nice butt.
Ms. Saniye, I'm 50 years old.
It looks 40. Do you work out?
No, I just do a little boxing and stretching.
Let me apply this.
Oh! This is my song!
-Well… -I love it! God!
Can I get dressed?
Funda, you are the bomb, girl!
-Here you go. -But…
Drink it.
Enjoy.
Just one second, and I'll be done.
I mean… You put gin in it.
I'm almost done. It's all good, don't worry.
-Can I get dressed? -Alright.
Okay.
Okay, there are some wet wipes there.
Do you own the pharmacy?
Yes, but I'm leaving in three months. Terrible neighborhood.
They are all terrible. And those immigrants…
Yes?
Nothing. I just said, "Immigrants," and did this.
Oh. Anyway, let's clink glasses.
Go on. What show are you on?
I'm not on it. My name is from an old show. Ayzek.
Oh, I thought you were an actor! Everyone's on a show these days.
You need a casting agency for that.
I… I just love the sea.
I work on ships as a captain.
What about the hotel?
We're just trying it today. An acquaintance put us in contact.
They think I can run it. We'll try and see.
You made me drink gin.
Enjoy.
I only eat alkaline foods.
Oh? So you know about alkalis, huh?
Sure. I'm following PeriWords on Instagram.
Alkalis. Food intolerance.
Intermittent fasting. Outside of Ramadan.
And heavy metals.
But heavy metals entered my body when I got stabbed. Broke the diet.
Look at you!
My teeth will be fixed soon.
It's unbearable otherwise.
-My teeth? -This work! Let's clink glasses.
To the hero of the night.
I shouldn't drink. I have to work.
Stay until the song ends, okay?
It's a duet, right? It is two people.
It is two people.
-See you, Saniye. Kisses. -See you. Take care.
-Why are you here? -I just am.
-Are you okay? -I'm okay.
Good God…
You can lean on me.
-Can you use your leg? -I can.
-Did he stab your leg? -No, above my leg.
It will be fine.
He is always around here.
-What happened? Get well soon. -You won't believe it.
I'm fine.
I didn't even say anything to him.
-I mean… -Careful.
-Get well soon. Is it bad? -No, it's fine.
It's okay. It's just some drug addict.
He would screw his parents over for a pill.
The lady was alone. I slapped him, and he stabbed me. See?
-Yes. I'll get you spare pants. -It's fine.
It's nothing. Consider it your lucky charm.
This is nothing. Nothing at all!
I came to you, but she closed the shutters in my face.
What was there to do? Stop it now.
-Let's get your spares. -Look at the size of the hole.
Let's go.
I'll change and come back. All this on my probation day!
Give me the pants.
-Can I take them off here? -Okay.
All this in the middle of the night.
-Sorry. -Here.
God…
It's a huge hole.
Ms. Saniye said there is no need for stitches.
She should mind her own business. They are ripped. They do need stitches.
-Take off your underwear too. -Yeah, they are really bad.
Wait, I have three pairs that guests left behind.
-And wear someone else's underwear? -They are washed and clean.
How do people leave their underwear behind? I don't get it.
I'll wear them inside out.
I'll wash them for you. Take them off.
I can't make you wash my underwear.
What is going on?
Enough, for God's sake.
Jeez…
Everybody wants me to take my undies off today.
It's probation day!
What is it, Mr. Bahtiyar? What are you up to now?
I heard a fight. Is everything okay?
It is. Just some thugs. What, are you leaving?
I'd like a word in private, Metin.
-Let's sit and talk for a bit. -I can't sit, but okay.
Let's go.
So?
Yes. I thought about what you said.
-Look, we are strangers after all. -Yes.
Us being strangers is an advantage.
We can tell each other what we can't tell our closest loved ones.
Where are you going with this?
-I'd like to make a proper offer. -Go ahead.
Look.
This saxophone is worth 8,000 to 10,000 dollars.
It has a great mechanism. Even the wind can play it.
Wow.
This is my offer.
This instrument is my life, my closest friend.
-It belongs to your closest friend? -No, it is my closest friend.
You're offering 8,000 to 10,000 dollars?
And you want me to do what you asked before?
Please.
I could sell it in Tünel.
Or do you think I'll try to play it, fail, and then go sell it?
Please make sure a worthy person buys it.
Sure, I'll research him first. I'll even keep tabs on the guy.
I want your phone too.
It's better for me in this mission.
Okay.
-Go on. -Let me bring it from my room.
Wait.
I'll take care of your problem, but don't tell anyone.
I'll set the place and time, okay?
Don't act out or harm yourself, okay?
Okay.
-What's this? -A failed attempt.
You're paying for the lamp.
Give me your phone.
-You want the case? -Nah, keep it.
Yes. Let's leave the room. It's too depressing.
We'll play by my rules now, okay?
-Give me your word. -Okay.
I can't hear you.
-You have my Peri word. -Okay.
Look.
Suhal is clever. She must not figure it out, okay?
You can't give up now.
I won't give your instrument and phone back, okay?
-But I'll forget the 270 liras. -Okay.
Okay? What's your passcode?
1991. The year when Stan Getz died.
And when I took my captain's exam. So I won't forget it.
-Are you on Instagram? -Kind of.
-Is this you? -Yes.
Fourteen thousand followers.
And you wanna die. Shame on you. I only have 14.
Okay. I'll take care of everything.
Let's go.
Hello, Suhal.
Are you okay, Mr. Bahtiyar? Take a seat.
I'm so embarrassed, Suhal. I'm so sorry.
It's sad. I haven't seen you like this before.
No, he is fine. He is all good.
You guys keep chatting, okay? I have some work upstairs.
There is a rat upstairs. Do you have rat poison here?
It's up there. In the back.
You drew these? They are lovely, congrats.
Thank you.
She draws them. She makes them up in her head.
I just draw away.
I'll make some tea now.
Let's sit down and rest.
I got stabbed today and still haven't sat down.
Ms. Saniye told me to rest too.
She is an alcoholic.
Is it right to label people?
She doesn't care what others say. We are alike.
It's okay if she doesn't care. She's still an alcoholic.
Tell Mr. Bahtiyar about it. He is the professor.
They are all crazy, I swear.
I'm handling all of them.
What's up with this crowd?
But it's a crowd. I'm a person. So I'm good.
Everybody has a problem with somebody. They'd fight each other if I let them.
Let's plan everything.
MICKEY-X - RODENT KILLER
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
-You scared me. -Water, please.
We…
We are chatting with Mr. Bahtiyar in the laundry room.
Join us if you want.
He is a lot better now. Calmer.
-Sure, fine. -We're chatting.
Alright.
Let's drink our tea.
We felt sad. We felt emotional. We met at a weird time.
It'll enter your blood stream in 20 minutes. Let's talk a bit.
Yes, alright.
Come, sit down.
So, tell us.
I don't want to trouble you with my problems.
But you were so cheerful the other day, Mr. Bahtiyar.
We listened to you play on the terrace.
Dear, I think I lost a bit of hope in life.
I'm ashamed to say it in front of you…
Why, sir? Do we look even more hopeless?
Good catch, Suhal. He is projecting now.
Let me ask.
Does hope sustain the poor?
Or maybe we can ask, do the rich also need hope?
So, I'm rich? Weird.
I don't get it, sorry. Say it again.
Just talk to pass the time.
What is hope?
I don't really like those set notions.
For example, they say, "Hope sustains the poor."
It sounds meaningful and powerful when you say it like that.
But these are heavy concepts.
It would take hours to look deeply into them all.
Just sum it up in 20 minutes.
I don't really like talking as if I'm an expert.
But in life, not every kind of hardship comes with hope on the side.
Anyhow… I quit fighting anyway.
It appears that I did. I'm waiting to see what happens.
How about this. Knowledge or intuition?
I'm not really a good example. Your…
Wait, what is happening to my voice?
Sorry.
What did you say? Intuition?
Or knowledge?
Dear Metin, you put me in a tough position.
Can't we discuss it at a better time?
These are hard questions. Can't we talk about everyday stuff?
So you're saying
you'd die before you discussed these matters with people like us.
Please, that's not what I meant. That's not it at all.
So, every day is not a new hope?
Fine. It is.
Sorry, I get a little angry.
I get it. You think mine is a charmed existence.
But once we acknowledge our troubles, we need to come to a meaningful analysis.
I understand you, sir.
Really? I'd like to be understood too.
I think you'd actually like to be loved.
No.
Isn't it better to understand?
No. To be understood.
What does it mean to be understood? Are you a physics question, dear Ayzek?
Please. People want to be loved.
Mr. Davut, I have a question. To be loved or to be understood?
To love, I think.
Mr. Davut has a completely different approach.
Please, take a seat, my friend.
But Mr. Davut is already…
Already what?
To be loved is passive, so he might be avoiding it.
Sorry, that's not the topic.
-He just said, "To love." -I'm a bit confused, sorry.
Between being loved and loving, I choose loving, you know.
Loving madly.
Sure, it has to be madly. Anyway.
-Are you making fun of me? -No, never.
No.
-It's just my head… -No, I mean…
I don't have a bad opinion of you.
He just said, "To love." It's not bad. What?
You know, is it wrong to say, "To love"?
-I don't get it. -No, sir.
What is it?
Rat poison. You gave him rat poison.
Who do you think I am?
He is dying, and we're drinking tea with him?
Pretty girl.
Letitgoxine, six milligrams. It's my prescribed pill.
I gave him one. He'll be mellow in 20 minutes.
And I took his phone. We'll call his friends to come get him.
-I can't deal with him all night. -Okay, good idea.
You just wait. I'll have him dancing in no time.
It's my prescribed pill.
You're on pills?
I am. I take one in the morning, one at night.
-What's wrong? -I had two pills here.
But there is none left.
Wait a minute.
It's prescribed. My prescription was in the pocket of my pants.
-I washed them. -What do you mean?
But the pockets were empty.
Wait a minute.
I took the bloody prescription out of my pocket.
I put it down on the reception desk.
-It's not a big deal, but… -Well…
I thought I had two pills when I left the house.
But I guess I left one on the kitchen counter.
-I thought I had two, but there is none. -You need it? Didn't you take one today?
I need to take another one, but I have a prescription.
I'm not that addicted. You think I'm a pill popper, girl?
No, I just thought I had it with me.
-You seem concerned. -No.
I just take an extra one with me when I leave the house.
I checked my coat. It's not there.
But at least Ms. Saniye knows me, so…
Oh, good.
I have a prescription, but it's covered in blood.
But she is on night duty. Don't worry about it.
Goji berry?
It's good for everything.
-Someone is calling. -I can't answer now.
What is this? It's sour.
It's an antioxidant.
Anyway. At least, she is on night duty.
She is on night duty, so don't… Don't worry. Let's not worry.
Let's…
Once he falls asleep…
We never had a chance to talk.
Let's talk about us.
Huh?
Go downstairs. I'll bring us tea.
Let me take this with me.
It's covered in blood.
It's illegible.
Completely illegible.
I mean, they're all emotions, you know.
As far as I understand, of course.
Look, you can't just say, "They are all emotions"
and leave it there without delving deeper.
When it comes back to you as a problem…
You'll say, "What is a problem?" Life itself?
Loving madly.
Loving madly is a real thing, right?
I mean, Davut, my friend, loving like they do in poems and novels.
By the way, he is a literature professor.
You know, loving to death.
That exists. Loving like they do in poems and songs.
You know how words become meaningless? That's where I am at right now.
I get it. You want something powerful, right?
Like a rock, but not a rock, because it has an organic aspect.
It should be more like cement.
Okay? Like sand, stone, pebble…
It should be a heavy block. Bam! Boom!
We should say something heavy and respectable. Oh, wow!
What novel are you talking about?
But there are novelized lives.
Yes, but what do you get from them?
Okay, novels and poems have themes.
I get it. But what do you get from them?
I'm talking about what happens when you are the subject.
Where are you from, Professor?
-He asked where you are from. -He did!
I haven't heard that one in years! He is asking where…
-But he said nothing… -But how… I'm from Suadiye.
He is from Suadiye.
I mean, please…
It's okay to ask.
Is this what you are saying, Davut, my friend?
Sometimes, we write our lives as if we were novelists.
Novelists, my ass. You can't write life.
You can only be subjects.
Excuse my cussing, dear Suhal.
-Look. -Let's… Come.
Floyd Barclay says the following.
He says, "As I'm dying, I'm only leaving my dignity behind."
Who am I talking to?
Sorry, alright.
I feel like my chest is expanding, Metin.
-Is it happening? -Sure…
Loving to death exists, you know.
-It exists, fine. It exists. -It does.
-Was it Floyd Barclay? -Yeah.
I'll Google him, because I like to learn new things.
How about going to bed now, sir? Let's go to your room.
-I'll read a book to feel better. -Sure, this was enough.
He said nothing, Davut. He chose loving too.
-Have a good one. -Alright.
Good night. I'll make your bed, Mr. Bahtiyar.
-We'll go, come on. -Shall we…
Your drawings are lovely. You are a great talent.
MY LOVE
"My love" is calling.
-My head feels like plastic, Metin. -Yeah? Mine too.
I didn't die, Metin. What do you think?
You? You will never die, good sir. Let's go.
You will never die.
I imagine a big, blue ball in my hands.
What do I do with it?
My old Peri friends will know the answer right away.
Turn it off, damn it. It's horrible.
What is a blue ball, for God's sake?
Please don't watch that ridiculous stuff, Metin.
Don't do it to yourself.
Jeez…
Look, Davut talks through his hat.
He spoke for ten minutes.
He didn't form a single sentence without "you know."
He kept saying "you know." "You know this. You know that."
I couldn't help but ask, "What do I know, sir?"
It didn't register.
What do you want him to say?
Should he say, "I know"? He says, "You know." He's including others.
He says, "You know." He's including others.
I can't believe how positive you are.
Sometimes, you stir up even me.
I wanna grab you by the ears and pour all my knowledge into your head,
but I'm tired.
Metin.
Davut is a menace.
Sir, tell me something.
You think Suhal suits me?
-Honestly? -Yeah.
No.
-Because she is an artist? Right. -Anyway…
Hello, Bahtiyar? Are you there? Hello--
"Ms. Dora,
we are in the Komodor Hotel."
"Mr. Bahtiyar is sleeping right now."
"Metin."
I shouldn't sign my name.
"Çetin."
I shouldn't sign any names.
"Goddamn you"?
What did I say?
Did he go to sleep?
The asshole is making fun of us.
These men are like kids. Don't take them seriously.
You are dripping with sweat. What happened?
I'm just working, my friend.
Good.
Is the lady downstairs your…?
I'm sorry, but are you two…?
Our parents stepped in and had a talk about marrying us.
But I didn't want to, and she got hurt.
Marry her out of compassion.
I don't think so. I mean, considering everything…
Fine. I'll go to bed. I should be up around 7:00 or 7:30.
Go on and sleep.
You know, she works nights so she must…
If you mean it'll make the family stronger because I also work nights, I agree.
Take it. You ate nothing all night. Get yourself food. Here.
Davut, my friend, you know what I do when something is wrong?
Bang bang.
Always.
Good morning. I'm Peri. Who are you?
We meet again on our journey to find ourselves. Shall we begin?
Lately, I'm tired of hearing the following.
"How do I make them happy?"
I don't know. Maybe it's too deep. But you know what I do?
I take a deep breath.
And I say,
"I'm not pizza."
It sounds weird at first. But don't try to please everyone.
Why?
Why?
Yes, why shouldn't I try to please everyone?
It's a simple question.
Why?
Why shouldn't I try to please everyone?
Suhal.
A lot happened, and we didn't get to talk.
I misunderstood some stuff.
You misunderstood some stuff.
Metin, my friend…
"My friend"?
Okay, call me your friend. Fine.
If I'm projecting as a friend to you, call me your friend.
Metin, my friend, our parents took it upon themselves to discuss it.
I actually moved out a year ago.
They said you were our neighbor.
And you could work at the hotel and talk to me.
And you started working here. That's it.
They said you had been home for two years,
you needed it, and your mom cried a lot.
They gave you a sob story.
Alright, but it's a really toxic approach.
They think so because it's outside of their mentality.
I didn't pity you. I'm also…
We come from the same place.
Life is difficult.
Okay, what you are doing now is called "zoning."
You're pulling me to your zone. You're empathizing with me.
There was a video about it.
-Okay, fine. -I mean…
We can't figure everything out in one night.
Marriage? I gave my mom a piece of my mind about it.
She was just being a mom.
So we will just say…
"Our moms brought us into this world."
And we will just accept how they are.
It was mentioned in root therapy. No need to go there. Never mind.
I mean…
It hurt that you pitied me.
Wow. Pity…
I mean…
I called my mom.
I said, "Suhal is a beautiful girl."
Don't get me wrong.
I said, "She is beautiful. She deserves beautiful things."
"We may not be suitable."
I said…
I figured if I did something,
you could maybe form the notion that I didn't like you.
So I decided to give off the energy that I liked you.
Then…
Then, I was a little short with you because…
I was being intuitive. I mean…
You gave me some information now.
I'm turning my intuition into information and saying…
I mean… You deserve beautiful things.
In terms of our adapting… I get it.
As a result… I mean…
I understand your struggle. Truly.
After all, you are a young woman trying to stand on her own two feet.
Sorry.
I apologize.
-It was in the video. -What freaking video?
Dumbass!
Fuck off!
Well…
Um…
You know PeriWords?
On Instagram… Videos…
Wanna watch a video?
Really? Interesting.
Don't play it too loud. Don't play it through here.
But you need to hear it.
When I come home, I feel like I'm in my castle.
A castle of cotton, of course.
I don't know how I came up with that name.
Okay, people always ask me the following question.
"Who is my soulmate?"
This girl had her face done. She got surgeries.
It's not about that.
I'm looking for the self-help stuff. This is what I do these days.
It's 4:00 a.m. Stop it, for God's sake.
I keep picking the songs. You pick one now.
But keep going with slow songs.
I typed in "saxophone."
Saxophone.
I don't like blowing it.
I do it only when I'm in love.
-Come here. Come on. -Well…
Come here.
Well, I need to take my meds.
Alright, if you take it now, it will take 20 minutes to work.
No, I mean… Letitgoxine, six milligrams.
That's really strong, man.
Well, can you give me one?
My love.
-Do you have a prescription? -No.
I don't like it when people are more cunning than me. Don't make me mad.
No, I took one in the morning. I need to take another at night.
I wouldn't give you an addictive pill even if you fucked me.
-So… -So, no.
Oh. You won't give it, right.
Jeez!
You think you can fuck me over because I'm drunk?
Who do you prefer, Ajda or Sezen?
-In what regard? -Shut it! Who shall we listen to?
You were a lovely lady. I just wanted one pill.
We're neighbors!
Now you sound like a shopkeeper.
Look, I'm not pizza. I can't please everyone!
Don't make me mad.
I just need a pill. Why can't you give it?
I'm on probation here. My hands will start to shake.
What if I break something? Just one pill!
-Okay! -Why can't you give it?
Calm down. I will. Get out.
-You will? -Get out. I will.
-Give me just one. -I will. Just get out.
-Okay. You will? -Promise. Get out. Careful.
-Don't close it. -Okay.
-You will? -Promise.
-I will. Let's close it. -Okay.
Look, I'm even more of a devil than you are.
Fuck off! You bastard. Pill-popping asshole!
You're the pill popper!
The doctor gave me the pill, okay?
I'm trying to get better. You have all the pills!
You drunk!
You drink like a fish!
It was just one pill…
You're the pill lady!
Okay. Ajda or Sezen? Sezen. Please open up.
Good evening, Mr. Çetin.
Yes, ma'am. I'm Çetin.
Welcome aboard. How may I help you?
How is it going, I wonder? Is everything okay?
Yes. Look, I'm eating almonds.
-Shall we? -After you.
Everyone's complaining about you.
It's the service industry, ma'am. It's hard to deal with people.
Come join our industry.
Don't you also deal with people?
No.
After you, ma'am.
-What do you have for food? -What would you like?
A quinoa salad with a slice of avocado.
And some juice with it, maybe?
Papaya, please. Reduces inflammation.
Right away.
Ms. Peri, I'm glad you are here.
I need to serve you. Our other guests are worthless.
Go on.
Okay.
A quinoa salad with avocado slices on top.
What the hell?
We're all eating rice, honey.
Hurry up! The guest is waiting!
What is he talking about?
Beautiful.
I eat this stuff too. Look at my skin.
Skincare is important.
Ms. Peri, you always say in your videos, "Imagine it, and it will happen."
Do you think it's not happening for me because I'm in my comfort zone?
What's a comfort zone, for God's sake? What do I always say in my videos?
"Don't play it safe. Be open to adventure."
Who will collect garbage in the morning if everyone goes on an adventure?
What garbage?
I was just wondering.
Thanks, you can take it away.
We promise you the comfort of your mother's womb.
-Oh? -Sure.
Or the freedom that makes you feel as if you're flying on the other side.
But I need the part between those two points.
I see.
But I'm not a small baby.
And I'm not dead.
Weird…
Come on in.
I came to check on you.
I'm checking on me too. Take a seat.
Guess who came to the hotel. Peri Sönmez.
We're doing a one-on-one session. You'll all see when we finish.
Do you know what your dilemma is?
People who can advise you don't have the time.
People who have the time to advise you don't have the brains.
-Who are you quoting? -Myself, dear. Feel free to use it.
I'll Google if this is a quote from someone.
Ms. Peri always says, "Imagine it, and it will happen."
You can't have a feast without working for it.
What feast?
She just asked for an avocado salad. Don't slander her.
Look, does this make a sound if you don't blow into it?
So? What do you mean?
I mean, do you remember the saying,
"If you're the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room"?
Cut to the chase. I know what you mean.
I'm leaving this room immediately. You clearly don't have time, okay?
You really thought I'd kill you for 8,000 to 10,000 dollars?
You should apologize.
You're right.
I told you that Floyd Barclay quote.
"As I'm dying, I'm only leaving my dignity behind."
I guess I left my dignity behind at that moment.
Sorry. I'm okay now, don't worry.
You're okay? I'm not!
Do not disturb me again!
What is he talking about?
Do not disturb me. You're disturbing me.
"You…" "Loving you…"
"You…" "Loving me…"
"Love…"
LOVING ME…
"You…"
I don't like it when people do a favor and expect something in return.
Understood? Okay? Take the pants.
I don't want you around me!
My appearance means nothing to me right now, okay?
I don't care what people say!
Do not disturb me!
You did the right thing. People should know their place.
She still gave me the cold shoulder.
So what? It's a noble kind of loneliness.
Right, I don't need anyone.
Saniye! Open the door! Open it!
You alcoholic! You nasty woman! You alcoholic!
It all started great!
You ruined everything!
Open up!
Give me my medicine!
Give me my medicine!
I told you to open it!
Open up!
Give me medicine!
Open up!
You ruined everything!
Open it!
I'm begging you! Please open it!
I'm begging you, please.
Please open up.
Just one.
Only one.
Fine. I'll open it. I'll give you your medicine.
On one condition, though.
I'll do whatever you want.
Promise.
What's going on?
Nothing.
What's up?
I was a sailor, sir. We'll land safe and sound.
I got this.
Asshole.
Could you pass me the saxophone, sir? Could you?
I've been very kind and loving to both of you.
But I can't see any progress in our relationships, okay?
Only Mr. Davut is as good as ever.
Go on, play music and dance like I'm not here.
-What's wrong? You're drenched in sweat. -Really, Professor?
"Everyone is a therapist. Everyone has an opinion."
I wonder who said that.
What's this?
Young people like it. Can you play it?
Please…
Can you?
Go on.
Okay. This will be a story and also on your feed.
Look, I can adapt. Can you two?
-You're scoffing, right? -Please. We had a laugh.
You're all happy thanks to my kindness, get it?
I'm carrying your burden. I'm doing everyone's work.
Including Saniye! What do I get in return? Nothing.
Didn't you take your pill?
"Did you take your pill?" I think you took your pill!
Did you know this lady slapped me?
Did you ever slap this gentleman? Who am I even talking to?
"Imagine, my love. Imagine a jailer, jealous of the jailed."
"It is all so very tragic."
"They are jealous of us. And they will be jealous."
"Because it's hard to live history as a proper human being."
Edip Cansever.
I'll find the best quote ever on the internet!
Okay? I'll find the best one.
Look.
"Life lasts a day, and that day is today." Can Yücel.
-He never said that. -Really?
You're a professor, but you're ignorant about the internet.
The internet is full of these. He has no idea!
I'll defeat you, my man. I swear.
Don't play with me. I'll defeat you.
You are dead to me, okay?
I'm just trying to teach Suhal more about life.
You don't care about that.
You even said, "I'm not a good example." Shut up then.
Suhal, you have dreams, right? Are these your dreams?
Let me see. You haven't progressed at all. Is that it?
Like, is this a woman? What is it? What?
They look amateurish. Is this how you get into university?
If this is the state of our schools, it's worrying. Which is true.
What's wrong with her drawing? It's naïve and consistent.
Oh, yeah!
Look, Van Gogh's brother told him that his paintings looked quickly drawn.
And?
And he said, "Because you take a quick look at them."
Holy crap!
Look at Van Gogh! He was quick on his feet.
He had a quip for his older brother.
Don't you have a statement of your own?
"Van Gogh said this. Doystoy said that." It's just gossip, huh?
"Have you read this book? And this poem?" You keep dropping names.
-"The books I read can fill this room." -I never said that.
Yeah? And I grew up in a book-sized room.
-You're just seeking manifestos. -Yeah?
I gave you information. You rejected that too.
Who am I even talking to?
You know who you are? It's right here.
"You are a vile man." Not my words, by the way.
Ayzek, enough.
Ayzek? See, it says Çetin. Read it if you are literate.
You show off to her, but when it comes to me…
If you wanted to be understood, you'd try to explain.
-Don't argue with stupid people… -Yes, that's an internet quote too!
"Don't argue with stupid people. They will drag you down to their level…"
Why don't you take me to your level?
Pull me up to your level!
And I'll be on your level, no?
Metin, that's enough.
-Bitch ass! -Watch it!
Okay, I'm sorry.
But I'll stop talking to both of you, okay?
And I'll unfollow you.
Go find out what it means.
Do you know what hurts me the most in life?
Being enemies with learned people like you.
Let me join you up there.
Let me, please. Let me be with you.
Please stop watching those videos. Please stop it.
You're jealous!
-Please… -You are!
You drew him?
You said you drew from memory! But he posed for you!
You just wait…
"I…" "I was born with you."
"You…"
"You died with me."
Here is a can of worms for you…
"You…"
"I gave you my hands, my precious rose."
"My precious rose…"
"But…"
"But you had my heart in your hands."
A can of worms for you.
Here it is.
NEW POST
Alright.
He got a like even for that!
Here.
Don't say a word about it, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
A good deed, huh? Look at yourself.
I didn't say it, I swear.
You turned out to be such an awful person.
You think so?
Take this. Keep it for yourself.
No, there is no need.
You have a victim mentality.
You make stupid jokes about serious matters.
True.
I found you funny only once. Just once.
That's okay, thanks.
-You're right, brother. -Thanks.
What show are you on?
Um, The Love Boat.
Are you angry, my love? Here.
Dude, you wronged me, you know?
You're right. Forgive me.
-You want to be loved. -True.
-I love you, my brother. -Yes.
Ajda or Sezen?
Both.
I understand you all.
Remember Floyd Barclay.
Okay.
Enjoy.
Your videos are useless. We'll have a talk.
Did you take your pill?
No, we'll talk with a clear head.
I'm putting myself out there.
But they are arguing with me instead of respecting me.
-Who? -Everyone!
Don't worry about it. These are toxic thoughts.
In your videos, do you ever say,
"Take a look at yourself, analyze yourself"?
No. You say, "Put yourself in the center."
Who am I to be in the center? Wait.
What? Who am I? Maybe I'm an asshole.
Then you tell me to take a deep breath. That's it.
Paranoia.
What did you eat? Did you eat acidic foods today?
Clearly. What else could it be?
For three months, my mom didn't know I ate avocado.
I ate alkaline foods for what? Everyone's still making fun of me.
But you're closing off your perception.
I'm not! I'm sharp as a razor.
I have eyes everywhere. Which is unnecessary.
Do you grate cinnamon sticks onto your probiotic yogurt?
I don't grate shit.
Our families used to eat a kilo of cheese pie on Sundays 30 years ago.
And we weren't stressed.
You don't teach me how to communicate with others.
But I see it now. I'll wreck you on Twitter.
You have 14 followers, Ayzek.
So? Aren't they human beings?
Sure, it means nothing if I don't have a million followers.
Keep attacking us because we are helpless.
I'm piss-poor.
But I'm not good because I don't eat probiotic yogurt?
You have an opinion on everything. "Carob pods make you feel peaceful."
You even have an opinion on bulgur.
Stop freaking knowing everything
from the rings of Saturn to the stuff in a mother's womb!
People should doubt themselves a little.
Honey, is your immunity important or not?
How could eating sausage be a crime? Huh?
I'm on bad terms with my mom. Okay, fine.
My mom is bad. I'm bad. It happens.
But why do I listen to you?
I stopped talking to my brother-in-law Ibrahim because Mercury is in retrograde.
Because it's toxic. What?
But I know now.
I'll be after you till Judgment Day.
The afterlife. My favorite.
Sure. You're all there too, right? Angel energy or whatever.
Don't meddle with everything. Miss out on some stuff.
I moved to Peru, you know?
There is a temple there at 5,000 meters.
There, you do breathing and energy and yoga…
-Am I talking to myself? -Of course.
Huh? Am I talking to myself?
Yes.
You hurt me with your videos.
But I'm hurt too, Metin.
Yes, Mom?
Metin, son, I don't like the way you've been acting.
It's okay, Mom.
I accept and approve of myself. It's okay.
Don't talk to your mom. She is completely negative.
She is, right?
I have a question.
Are you all happy at least?
Am I the only failure?
How would I know, dear Metin? I died two years ago.
Those are old videos.
I'm happy, of course. I'm pure energy now.
And those videos, I don't know, felt good back then, love.
It's just loneliness, really.
Really? Is that it? Really?
How did you die?
I fell and apparently died while skiing.
In Uludağ?
No, somewhere abroad.
Of course.
-How did you fall? -Like this.
Ayzek!
What's up? I called you yesterday, but you didn't answer.
Wow, Salih, my friend!
-How are you? -What happened? You don't look good.
This is beneath me, right?
I did great at sea. I fucked up on land.
Unfortunately.
The pandemic took its toll too.
You're not wearing a mask.
Well…
I stopped wearing them today.
Are you in touch with the guys from the port?
I see Bahri. Mehmet works with me.
Right.
If they ask, tell them Ayzek is a shipwreck now.
I'm the night manager here.
-Are you okay? -I am.
Suhal…
You know the…?
Could you call…
Mr. Bahtiyar's wife, Dora?
I sent her a bunch of weird texts.
I don't want to mess things up. Could you talk to her?
What are these?
What are these?
I wrote her poems to convince her.
I also sent quotes from Google.
What about the poop emoji?
It seems I got angry at some point.
Could you call her so that she comes and gets Mr. Bahtiyar?
But why?
I just wanted to be useful and do something nice.
I can't call her. You do it.
Okay, I'll keep you out of it.
But be yourself, okay?
I should be myself now.
Okay.
-Yes, Bah… -Hello, ma'am.
I'm Metin Arıcı, the night manager here at the Komodor Hotel. Are you Ms. Dora?
Wait a minute. Where is Bahtiyar? Did something happen?
Mr. Bahtiyar had a little accident last night, ma'am.
We tried, but couldn't reach you.
Sorry, what accident?
Can I see Bahtiyar if he is there?
Sure. Say you're fine.
-I'm fine. Don't worry. -Did something happen?
No, ma'am. I'm here. Nothing can happen.
Thank you so much, Mr. Metin.
I'll be there soon, Bahtiyar.
Could you send me your location?
-Of course, right away. -Thank you. Thanks.
Thank you. Thanks, ma'am.
One thank you was enough.
I spoke really well.
I can express myself really well once I organize my thoughts.
-Take your phone. -Thanks.
You are good at what you do, yes.
You ignorantly made me take a random pill, but it's okay.
-Stop trying too hard. -I'm not.
Weird, isn't it, Professor?
It works if you don't try too hard. It doesn't work even if I do.
-Here, sir. -Thanks.
You can check it. It hasn't been touched.
I have no doubts.
Really? It's good to doubt a little. You're a scientist after all.
I'm a man of literature, you know. I want to believe.
Floyd Barclay.
He is very grumpy. He complains about everything.
May God make your life easy.
That's not how we see it.
You sent me those weird texts, right?
No, I'm the night manager here.
Okay.
Thanks again. Have a good one.
People are weird, right, Suhal?
He left without paying my 270 liras.
No, everyone is whoever they are.
Huh!
Is the nerd gone?
He wasn't a bad guy.
-Would you like breakfast? -No.
Tea?
-I'll make some. -Alright.
Suhal, Mr. Cengiz said Hacer would come at 7:00.
You know her? A woman is coming.
Yes, it's Mrs. Hacer.
Morning.
-How are you? -Thanks.
He said she was short.
Mrs. Hacer!
-Davut, my man, what is going on? -Stop!
What is going on?
Stop!
-Hacer! -Davut?
-Mrs. Hacer! -What are you doing?
-She fell. -Stop!
-Davut, man! -Did it hit?
Davut, please!
-My car keys! -Mrs. Hacer!
Get me out of here!
-Is there a back door? -Give me the gun!
Are you okay, dear?
-My friend… -The exit…
-How did that happen? What did you do? -I shot her.
-Is the exit downstairs? Get me out! -Don't! I can't!
Don't! I can't!
Davut, don't!
I thought you were a great man, a good human being.
-This is why I came here. -Please.
I didn't sleep all night! I made up my mind!
I was always on your side. I thought you were good. Please.
-Here, put it in your pocket. -This was your idea?
-I'm thinking. -You'll run away?
-I will. -Don't do it.
-I will. -Friend…
Lose the gun. Throw it away. You're my friend, okay?
-Okay. -You're my friend.
-Is there an exit there? -Yes.
-There is no exit here. -There is.
-What is going on? -I can't go back to the door.
Look, I was always on your side tonight.
I thought you were a good man. Hacer was going to come at 7:00.
They trusted me with the hotel. But you shot Hacer!
I loved her to death! I was dying of love!
Is this love? I saw that lovely, beautiful girl here.
I did things for her. Mine is not love, but yours is?
Loving madly!
Loving like they do in novels and movies!
What novels, man? What novels?
What are you talking about?
Tell me a single novel that you read!
You know, I…
Stop saying "you know!" You're still saying "you!" Don't involve others. You need to say "I!"
I was on your side.
I kept saying all night, "Davut is a good man."
And you kept doing this!
I kept putting it in the box, did you know?
What's the jail time for this?
I won't go to jail. I'll run away.
You'll run away.
Do you have a nice tie?
I do.
Good, wear it to court.
What the hell?
Metin.
-Call an ambulance. -Okay.
-Metin! -It's fine.
Call an ambulance!
-I'll call the police. -You're a good guy.
-Call an ambulance! -I'll call the police.
Get me out of here.
Metin!
Call an ambulance.
Metin?
Go upstairs. Go.
It's okay. Go.
Metin!
Call an ambulance.
Metin!
Call an ambulance.
What did I tell you?
I go bang bang when something is wrong, right?
Call an ambulance.
Metin. Metin, you are a good person.
Call an ambulance!
Metin, you are my friend!
Metin, you are my friend!
Metin, call an ambulance!
Metin! Call… Metin.
Here, this is your share of the tips.
Go to a nice school with it.
You dropped this.
I'm not Çetin.
I'm Metin from the Karaköy port.
-I'll take Mrs. Hacer home. -Okay.
Homemade feed?
Fish meal, oyster shells, HB 101, mushrooms-- two types.
Good chicken. Free-range.
Akira Edogawa.
Nadi…
your brother.
When?
When what?
You kill.
Akira, five years ago. Nadi, last year.
And the other three?
Oh, you know.
You know…
I… out of game now.
Still, though, you must atone.
Shorty Jap.
"The woodland lake of Nemi-- Diana's Mirror…
The grove of Aricia…
There prowls a priest, King of the Wood.
He seeks to kill a man, and…
having killed him,
is soon killed himself."
Officer? There's been a murder.
I'm going to a movie. With Goro Idezuki on Sunday!
You go, girl!
-I'm jealous. -I'm nervous!
-Will I be okay? -You'll be fine.
Do you think so?
What the…? We can't do this!
Wanna die, too?
POLICE
Urgent! Second Street, Shinjuku!
Chief.
Mad Dog was killed.
-Witness protection guy? -A former cop killed him.
-Where is he? -We drugged him.
-Any trouble? -Some, during transport.
Goro Idezuki, a cop in Shinjuku ten years ago.
There was a robbery at a supermarket.
Three girls and a lady working there were killed.
They arrested one guy five years later. He was never charged.
He was found dead a month later.
Goro Idezuki was AWOL from Rapid Response Unit 4.
Likely been hunting them down. Killed 'em all.
-I wonder why. -In love with one of the girls?
Revenge? For a girl you never even held hands with?
That's dysfunctional, son.
We can give you a second life. Undercover agent.
-Who is "we"? -Metropolitan Special Crimes--
-Who are you? -I'm Chief Anai.
Undercover agent.
Go into Toshokai.
The fifth boss died four years ago.
A war broke out over who would take over.
The Ujiie family, the "Expelled" vs the Kozu family.
-Remember? -I was in Mumbai.
It's the biggest family in Kanto, 7000 strong.
Non-expansionist yakuza.
Tokyo-based. Cozy with authority.
A former cop mediated the feud. Kozu became the sixth boss.
He created a legitimate business as a front, like the mafia.
Go on ahead.
No one carried weapons in public.
So, the Expelled snuffed him.
The seventh boss of the family chosen
to lead the revenge wasn't Toki, or the "Bear," Kumazawa,
or Chuji, the consigliere.
Chuji has no nose?
Bitten off. He wears a sharkskin mask.
Toake, the secretary, was chosen. A highly unusual selection.
He follows Kozu's ways. Also supports overseas expansion.
A hybrid unit of the Kozu and Mikami families.
AKA Hell Dogs.
That's Slick, the Mikami boss.
Toake uses them to fix problems.
His reach abroad has grown.
The top earners are members in Brazil, Philippines, Uganda--
-Uganda? -Ivory trade.
Toshokai is involved in elephant poaching.
Hell Dogs is in Bangkok.
That's Muro. Go pick a fight.
Join the Hell Dogs. It's your test.
Why him? Why not target the top guy?
You and Slick are oil and water.
This kid and I will get along?
98% work compatibility. With Slick, under 10%.
The rest are below 50%.
Potential lovebird?
Muro's parents were leaders of Veda.
The cult?
Yes. Executed for mass murder.
Muro is a yakuza psychopath.
Wicked and wild. Wants to be a hero.
Same as you. Fighting in the dark.
Say we hit it off. What--
Destroy the Expelled. Climb the ranks.
-What then? -And then?
Into the darkness.
Your contract and passport.
You know the callers in Kabuki-cho?
"Hot girls over here! Convenient girls!"
No cop has fallen so low as you.
You're a convenient man, Shogo Kanetaka.
SHOGO KANETAKA
Want some, Tak?
-No. -No?
-No rice balls? -No.
I'm gassed.
Finally!
I'm gonna kill it today.
I wanna go the hell home.
Which one?
The usual.
-Is that like a ritual? -What?
Everyday. Take out the toolbox.
Ask me which one. I say the usual. You line up body bags.
Who knows if they'll come?
I guess.
It's a ritual.
Maybe.
Ready?
Damn!
-And this? -Maintain this position.
Keep it here, and…
Why?
-Elbows tight. -Elbows tight.
-Make sure to control his hand. -Control it.
-Squat down. -Squat. Down.
I did it.
I did it.
You didn't.
It's so hard!
I'm dizzy.
I wanna get this! Here. He gets me and…
You're hopeless.
-I'm hungry. -You had 12 rice balls.
When I was a kid,
I spent six months on IVs on an empty stomach.
What?
My parents were members of the Veda Revelation.
-Veda, as in-- -Yup. The scary cult.
Never knew that.
'Course not.
Only the boss and the Kozu Trio know.
Is that from Mr. Jaw?
-They're coming. -When?
-In 15 minutes. -Oh, shit!
This will be useful.
How's security?
Airtight. My men are on guard 24-7.
See the amenities?
And the hot springs?
-Not yet. -I see.
How about golf tomorrow? Then the hot springs?
But our boss doesn't like to golf.
-Big bro's the only one who's good. -He's on another level.
-You mean Tiger? -People call him "Tiger Woods."
-What's here? -This is the great hall.
Amazing!
Contraband, torture… Perfect for anything.
We can even have a circus.
-It's like from Spartacus. -How much?
There's more to see over here.
How much?
Just a moment--
Mr. Jaw, you understand…
Stop! Please!
Stop. Don't.
I'm sorry, I…
Please, please, don't--
Hush.
Crush it… and crush it!
There it is.
Over here.
You smokin'?
That a cigarette in your mouth?
-I'm going to school 'em. -Don't kill 'em.
-Evenin'. -Evenin'.
They killed our last boss in a smoking room. Toshokai is now…
a smoke-free workplace.
Hey. Get the body bags.
Yes, sir.
-The hole? -Over there.
-Where? -There.
I don't see it.
That's it.
It's too small.
Is it? Guess a van wouldn't fit in it.
You dug your own grave.
Those are your graves.
-I'm sorry. Please. -See?
I don't wanna die.
Look at that. Ain't it somethin'?
Look here.
Weather's bad here, isn't it? Rain, typhoons?
-Right? -Yes, when it rains, it rains.
You knew that and still did this?
Maybe we should kill 'em. Can't trust 'em.
No more than five a day. That's my rule.
I killed one. Crushed one. Still have three today. What do you think?
-We'll dig! -Three slots left, you know?
We're sorry!
Shut up. The jury's still out. We're deliberating!
Okay, get in.
Get in the hole!
A commemorative photo.
For what?
I'm going to post this if you fuck up.
-Get rid of the van. -Yes, sir!
You're having fun. Smile. Say cheese.
-I'm going to grab a bite. -Okay.
Babe?
It's from Tak Boy.
Good timing, Emiri, hop on.
Now?
I was sleeping.
If not now, then when?
This call's about to change my life.
Good news or bad, that phoenix on your back will comfort me.
Okay.
-Hey. -Storm's passed.
-Any damage? -Three houses.
Destroyed?
Nothing left.
Good. Go take a couple of days off.
I'm back tomorrow.
Fine.
Good news?
Yep. Now George is the only one left of the Expelled.
Sing to me.
KILLED KINA AND TWO OTHERS DETAILS TO FOLLOW
-Ozu or Kurosawa? -Ozu.
-Picasso or Van Gogh? -Picasso.
Is that so? Mars or Jupiter?
Mars.
-Lawrence of Arabia or The Wild Bunch? -Lawrence.
Lawrence? Really? I mean, it's not bad, but…
Entered it wrong.
No way. Let me try again.
I'm not that stupid.
What the hell?
I did not enter the wrong number.
Nas-teeth!
Go get the door.
Clean up!
-Open the door! -Hurry up!
Hey! Open up!
-Go open the damn door. -Open it.
You can hear us!
Welcome back.
Be glad it was one kick.
Motherfuckers.
-Nas-teeth. -Don't.
-Stay outta this. -In a bad mood today?
We return. The passcode's changed. We're locked out.
-We risk our lives and this is our reward? -Calm down.
You probably pushed wrong.
You calling us stupid?
No, I'm not. What's going on, Slick?
-It's like MLB. -What?
Major League Baseball.
They dump a bucket of Gatorade on the guy
who hit the walk-off grand slam.
Meaning?
It's your hero's welcome.
-Then where's the-- -Don't.
-Who do you think you are? -You little shit.
We snuffed Kina, but George is alive.
Maybe backed by a family in the west.
-We know that. -Losing sight from your bookkeeping?
Cut it out!
Door's locked because of a damn prank.
We could have been killed by the door, and the family mocked--
Enough, Muro.
Since when are hit men so important?
Just like when we met in Bangkok, Slick, you can't see danger.
Tak!
-Cut this out! -Enough already!
Shut the fuck up!
I was dozing off, feeling so relaxed.
Then this noise? You know I love my barber time.
That chair costs as much as a Lexus.
-Sorry, sir. -Sorry, sir.
You're saying "sorry" to a yakuza?
What's wrong with you two?
Your big brothers and uncles come out
to welcome you home from the job.
But you bark at them like a stray dog.
Got a body like a tire.
Perhaps it's time…
Welcome back. Good job.
Yell at me, too, Pops.
Idiot. Clueless as ever.
I can't go unpunished--
It's no fun punching you.
Go donate some blood.
Have Tak fist fuck you.
Now let's go celebrate!
Yes, sir!
-The usual spot. -Hell yeah!
Good evening.
Welcome.
-This way to your table. -All right.
Not you. Go somewhere else.
Okay. Hug each other.
Tightly. A good one.
Sit over there.
Not there, Muro.
Over there.
At the end?
Cheers.
-Open your mouth! -Yes, ma'am.
Wider!
-"Va pensiero, sull'ali dorate." -Louder!
Sit there.
What's up, Bear?
-Eatin' steak? -About to.
It's a good place. Treat 'em well.
I know. We won't embarrass you.
And afterward?
Maybe karaoke? Wanna join?
I'm the secretary to the boss. Your men would freeze up.
I guess.
Sayo's opening a members-only club.
S and M, right?
Come over tonight-- a dress rehearsal.
-Toki? -Hey, Sayo.
I can get more girls.
Really? Then maybe I should perform.
This is a sweeter soy sauce,
pairs well with wasabi.
It's good.
Welcome. How do you like your meat?
He likes it very rare.
I had a four-ounce poop. So, another four-ounce steak.
Very well.
Six months without food?
A human experiment by Veda.
My brain says I'm full.
"I'm hungry" is your mantra.
It makes me human.
You? Human moments?
About four, five times a day.
-Pops. -What?
I'm done for tonight.
What about the S and M show? There'll be girls.
Massage over sex. I'm so stiff.
Stick that stiff in a girl, move it around.
-I'll get a cab. -I'll get it myself.
-Okay. -Good night.
Thank you, Pops.
O-Zez? Is that you?
A four-ounce poop? Still the same.
You could've said hi.
Surrounded by all those yakuza? No.
They make you do clean up?
I thought you'd be back.
-You did? -I did.
Hi, Tak. Long time no see.
-Ms. N available? -No, but I'll get you in.
Your Japanese improved.
It was never not good.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
I can't do next week.
-Next week… -Can we do the week after?
Week after? Let's see.
Then, how about this time?
I am crossing a bridge now.
I don't know what bridge it is.
I think I'll give it a name.
-You came out of Veda normal. -So are the others.
Folks on death row, Z?
-Don't call me Z. -Why?
-I have a name. -O-Zez.
-You forgot my name? -Who cares?
Hello.
-Boyfriend? -Yep!
-He's not. -I'm Muro.
-He's not. -I'm Nobana.
-Huh? -Nobana.
He's not.
-What would you like? -Two coffees.
-That's my seat. -Here?
Yeah, switch.
-Your seat? -It's my seat.
Delts, glutes, legs, all stiff on the right.
Most yakuza damage their liver.
-Is it bad? -Really bad.
Where'd you get your sixth sense?
Half the masseuses have it.
Bad energy crawls up our arms.
Disease and demons. Yours is a demon.
I need to rest five minutes for every ten. Otherwise,
it'll get me too.
O-Zez?
It's Anna.
Kids with a past, reunited. Let's hook up.
Not with a yakuza.
You blew me when I was a little wiener.
-I did not! -You did.
Stop it.
-You went to town! -I did not!
-All over it! -Over what?
Wanna know? Sit down.
No, don't.
Coffee?
-Ouch! -It's nothing.
She was all over me. You know what that means--
-Who cares? We were young. -Hey, shut up.
New password.
"0402bowling."
Why do you swallow it?
Just rip it up and toss it.
How did you end up an agent?
Like I said, I can't tell you.
-You know my story. -Yes.
You gotta give me something.
Hands up.
You make home visits to Chuji?
Yep. Once a week.
He has 'em too?
Of course he does.
But…
not as bad as yours.
Did Chief order you to go?
Oh, no. I've known him much longer.
-Before he lost his nose? -Yes.
I'm living by the code of the survivor. Just like you.
Toshokai killed my son.
Here. Upstairs.
Wow.
This is it.
It's kinda like the Veda days.
Kitchen for a large family. You even have a pyramid.
Wounds heal faster in there.
-Like our parents said? -We're not them.
Scary.
I have three other hideouts like this.
Why?
If I'm hurt, I want a pyramid wherever I need to hide.
I don't get it.
You make a lot of money.
I have enough. No one knows about this place.
No one's been here. It's the cleanest place I got.
And it's my favorite.
-Why do you have a shrine in here? -Cool, right?
-Pops? -Where you at?
At my massage.
Can you be here in 30 minutes?
Yes. The party's over?
Got some curious intel. Come over.
You look worried.
He never asks me to come this late.
As if he's considerate.
It's happened once before.
And it wasn't good.
He asked me about killing an undercover-- a narc.
A narcotics agent?
He was in charge of trafficking drugs for Slick.
A devil's job-- made mules swallow condoms full of drugs.
He looked evil. I had no idea he was a narc.
Chief told me.
Toshokai works with a big IT company on facial recognition.
The authorities have been stripped naked.
They're vulnerable, including their families.
Did you kill the narc?
I asked to do it.
I had to.
Slick's men carried it out. I think I was tested.
You'll be fine.
You won't be exposed. I'm 99.99% certain.
That's not 100%.
There's always a hole with humans involved.
-Fuckin' George surfaced in LA. -With who?
Yusuf Abu Khalil. Lebanese American broker.
-Deals anything from sex to hit men. -These pics?
Taken by a person in my network. Been missing ever since.
He was dead at home.
Job of a pro.
-Tantalizing. -Right?
-What's my job? -Bodyguard.
-For you? -Further up.
-You mean-- -Yep.
He has his team.
-You and Muro are our family's best. -True.
Too much for you?
We're not business-minded.
It's fighting we're good at.
I can't believe you!
Felt good, right?
Did you have to pull out?
But it felt good, didn't it?
Did you cum inside?
Nope.
I shoot blanks. No sperm.
-Always? -Yeah.
Since forever.
You'll make a good bum.
A good bum?
ASSIGNMENT FROM POPS
BODYGUARD FOR MR. X USUAL PARTNER
Did you pick the lock?
It was easy. My dad's a locksmith.
We shouldn't do this.
Do this? Like this?
I told you. I'm free after 3 a.m.
Pops may be asleep, but the others…
Don't worry. I'm careful.
It's dangerous.
Don't be cold. I might tell.
Sex on a tightrope. I love it.
-Mornin', ma'am. -Mornin', ma'am.
-I'll carry it. -What's your name?
-Fall. -Since when?
Since I was born.
And they're Spring and Summer?
That's right.
You can go, Mole.
How are you feeling?
My back is sore.
-Let's have a look. -Yes.
I can never get used to him.
To who?
Mole.
He's my shadow. He watches my health.
Watches your health?
He analyzes my bowl every morning.
-The bowl? -My poop.
Go, go!
-Go spar, Bear. -Too old.
Good, good!
Take that!
Behind you.
-All right! -Take a break!
Chuji, this is Tak from our family. You've met him before.
Hello, sir.
And this kid?
Muro. You forget already?
Muro… Muro. Your parents were on death row.
Smooth skin, college boy.
Go easy on him. I want them to do security.
That's no good. I want my Beasts to do it.
Your Beasts?
Mine are Hell Dogs.
Let 'em fight. The winner gets the job.
-My guys can leave. And clean up. -Yes, sir!
Clean up!
Selection complete.
-Now lift. -Yes, sir.
Teru, Baz, put a vest on those two.
Put it on, get in the ring.
Stand in a line facing me.
You're Team Japan.
You're listening to the national anthem. Hum along if you like.
Pray!
Start on the whistle.
Now fight!
You were shot shielding me. The shooting continues.
Get off the floor!
Fight.
-Fight! -Muro.
Get up.
Fight.
Fight!
Hey, Muro.
I said fight!
Muro!
Not me, not me.
Get 'em! Good, good!
I give up!
How did you get up?
Ouch!
Key card to the penthouse and your ID.
Easy days are over. Get ready.
Please handle us with care.
It's all out of love, Muro.
Ouch!
Meeting upstairs after you're done.
There's more to this job than being a shield.
My jewels. Balls one and two.
Ladies?
Boss's office is around the back.
You stand by here.
Sign these papers.
You're centurions. There are tons of rules.
-Centu-- -Roman captains.
Roman…?
Always carry bulletproof vests and briefcases. You are his shield.
Car doors are… reinforced.
No accessories that look yakuza. No gaudy ties.
Unplanned funerals happen. Wear dark suits, carry prayer beads.
Report anything suspicious by radio, however small.
Use private SMS with Mr. Bear. Keep him updated.
Be careful driving.
Cops will try to bust you for anything.
Wear your seat belt. Headset at all times.
No heavy drinking that cause hangovers.
President despises body odor. We have spare shirts here.
Basically, two days on, two days off.
-So, there's another team? -Right.
We didn't beat the A-Team?
Nope. They're still on detail.
-Can we meet them? -No.
-So, no shared info between teams? -None. Per the boss.
We're the subs so the A-Team gets their rest.
A-Team members can tell the type
of gun you're carrying, just by how you move. Scary.
Not the type.
Oh, but they can.
Let's go.
We have Neo-Episteme today.
At 5 p.m., with Mr. Dawson of the International Evangelical Alliance.
What's illicit business for yakuza?
GIRL STRANGLED MAN SENTENCED TO LIFE
Seven-year old girl kidnapped,
raped, killed and dismembered.
No premeditation, so the court spared the man's life.
"Death penalty not inevitable."
Tenth case a jury's recommendation has been rejected.
-Tak. -Sir?
Any thoughts?
Does yakuza's illicit business… include fighting for justice?
Who do you judge?
The killer, for sure.
I'd judge the judge who said it was "not inevitable."
Totally agree.
Shut up, Muro.
Good team. It was a good game.
It was.
I'm excited for a change.
You might save me from boredom.
I hope you do.
-Prayer beads. -Prayer beads.
You're hogging the water supply up north, Ms. Chao.
Toake is disciplined like a businessman.
Except he meets people who have bodyguards.
There's always pat downs.
He enjoys museums.
He has four cars. Not a single Tokyo plate.
Ten of his men live at his house.
Our day ends at his front door.
Always tips us 40,000 to 50,000 yen.
The ritual yesterday was strange.
This place was going to be a restaurant.
Chinese?
Our old boss was building a resort for yakuza where he'd retire.
A prayer spa.
"The woodland lake of Aricia. Diana's Mirror."
Bear, let's pray.
Sì, Capo.
Mythology Hall.
Corpus Mythorum.
I'll kill George, then finish this project.
-Is he gay? -Don't know.
-Old boss's lover. -Just worshipped him.
No woman?
His chauffeur told me…
No women allowed in here.
-He got no women? -No one regular.
-Dudes? -He's not gay.
You sure? Have you noticed the way he looks at Tak?
See? He wants you.
Please--
Sounds like you can get intel from the driver.
Don't. He wants you to bite.
Toake's having him talk?
He's careful-- it's a test. Don't ask questions.
Muro was asking the questions.
He can ask. You just listen.
What's the emergency?
Celebrating a promotion? See ya.
Stay. We'll go to the roof.
Why are you so mopey?
I'll come later.
You gotta meet everyone.
-I don't know… -Don't worry, they're cool.
We're almost there.
Here we are.
-There's so many people. -You're fine.
Hey, it's Anna!
Hey!
-Your boyfriend? -Who's this?
This is Hideki Murooka.
I'm Kyoko.
Nice to meet you.
Muro, remember me?
-Hey! Nobana, right? -That's right.
Toake has the police by the balls.
How so?
Incriminating files on higher-ups.
Toake's computer.
-Steal it. -It's fingerprint ID.
"Gummy finger."
It's got his index finger printed on it.
Tested 100 times on an identical box. 97% success.
-And the scandal? -Can't say it. It's classified.
How did you get the print?
There's a file on Toshokai.
He has no criminal record and he always wears gloves.
We had chances.
I'm done as an undercover if I do this. I'll lose my income.
You have 24 hours after he dies.
50% chance I'm there if he's attacked.
More likely I'll die first.
Protect yourself, let him die.
Easy for you to say.
-Ready? -Do it.
Revolution!
-No way. -Bummer!
Success.
Last one!
I'm out.
Last one.
What group is this?
-What do you think? -Guess.
-You're a choir. -A choir!
No?
Knew it.
You're behind George's actions.
No comment.
I'm a bodyguard.
I'm going to kill anyone who comes after Toake.
To an extent.
Double my risk benefit.
Copy that.
Twelve members of the same jury.
Close!
Right idea.
-Right idea? -But wrong.
But I'm wrong.
It's Tak who killed the narc.
I know.
If I'm exposed and they tell him to kill me, would he?
I need a massage.
A massage.
He's a fiend about money.
We pay him and he withdraws it right away.
What for?
Why not look into it?
No manpower. It's not critical.
He does his job. He's liked.
Saving for retirement?
There won't be one.
Tak is living in medieval times.
In that he's free of the law.
He wants a transfigured life.
He's ready to die for beauty, like in the old days.
Same as Toshokai.
No, it's not.
Toshokai is a bond of men. His is for all genders.
My arms can feel it when I work on his body.
Who's been called a murderer's kid?
For real?
Who's related to a victim?
Wait, what?
A convict can be helped, but their family gets no help.
Always apologizing…
We want to help others in our life.
It's not hypocrisy, and I've wanted a like-minded group.
We've been through so much that we understand pain deeply.
-So true. -Well said.
Jaco was on a documentary on TV.
I didn't want to be like my parents. I laid myself open on TV.
Talked about creating space for people like us.
Then, Anna and Duck called.
-Me too. -You were later.
-Yep. -I was?
Then, we connected with the Victims Families Group.
You'll fall low if you're not needed by someone.
What?
Stop, guys.
No, I didn't mean to--
So hot!
Yours?
Want a good time?
My God, you're so cute.
Drink with me.
Nari, look, look! Isn't that Tak?
Next time. Bye.
POLICE 2ND STREET, SHINJUKU
Something's strange.
Like what?
Six months ago, I got an envelope full of cash.
Inside it was 200K and a note saying,
"The killers have paid."
From who?
Only said "G.I."
Foreigner?
-Bogus address. -And then?
Every two months, I get another 200,000 yen.
-What? -200,000 yen?
-Any notes? -Not since the first.
Your mom died 12, 13 years ago?
Eleven. I know the date.
July 30th, 9:40 p.m. Three men robbed a supermarket--
-No details! -I know, no details.
They killed my mom and three high school girls.
My dad killed himself.
I went to the victims' families about the money.
-To Mr. Mamiya? -Yes.
One of the girls was his.
They all got the same cash and note.
Did they know who G.I. was?
Mr. Mamiya remembered a cop from the 2nd Street station.
Goro Idezuki.
Initials are "G.I."
A cop avenged them?
And he's also a benefactor? No way.
X-factor benefactor?
Stop with the dad joke.
-Okay, okay, hear me out. -Listen, guys.
Suppose I was that cop.
It was on my turf.
Maybe I saw the men earlier.
Like, "What if I'd stopped them?"
-Gotta atone. -Exactly.
So, he spends a decade hunting them?
-Eleven years. -No way.
It's possible.
But, listen! How dope if it were true, right?
"If." I'm saying if it were true.
-He's murdering. -That's badass.
Who cares? They killed, too.
What a fun night.
Idezuki!
Hey, Goro! Goro!
Here he is.
Call me? Oh. No! Don't do that!
-Goro? -Where?
Careful. Careful.
Wait, wait. What's going on?
-Here he is! -Don't use my real name!
Goro's right here!
Careful. Stand back, please.
Hey, I'm Johnny!
I bet you're right.
The cop on 2nd Street.
Spent years hunting the bad guys and made them pay.
An ideal life.
The hell it is! Stop living like this!
Get out and live with me.
I like the way it is now.
A place in Sydney wants me.
I'm flying out tomorrow.
Piece-of-shit alarm!
You could have woken me up.
You're great sleeping.
Great sleeping?
What's that supposed to mean? Cute? Pretty?
Sorry.
I brought some intel.
Gotta go.
I found out what Yusuf got for George.
A top mercenary. Oliver Hendrickson.
He's in Japan, with the Hanaokas.
-Nagoya or Kobe? -Pops will call you first thing.
Out of time. Bye.
Tak Boy.
-You're here. -Debriefing.
-The fuck? -Sorry.
Ears aren't for licking or chewing.
You're right. So right.
Hendrickson in Nagoya means George is teamed up with them.
-Do you follow? -Yes, sir.
The Hanaokas may be the largest family, but they're a mess.
The boss is in Nagoya, but HQ is still in Kobe.
The boss tried to move HQ to Nagoya,
but gave up after Kobe raised hell.
Opposition was led by Tawaraya, head of the Kobe family.
So, the boss set up a system to squeeze the Kobe faction.
Forces them to buy water, soap, TP and more
sold by the Nagoya faction.
Both are full of resentment.
Our boss invited Tawaraya up to deepen the wedge.
Isn't Tawaraya a prison buddy of Uncle Bear?
Been tight for 20 years, but I don't like him.
He flip-flops, he's a chameleon.
The boss and Bear need to be more careful.
What's my job?
-If he acts oddly, kill him. -We can't carry a gun.
-There's no pat down today. -Still…
WILD WEST FAMILY FEUD
I said, "It doesn't feel right." And they cut me out.
Think of it as standing in for me. Please.
-Ready? -Yes, sir.
We're ready.
Ho capito, due minuti.
-What's that? -Bear thinks he's Italian.
You ran into Tak outside a club?
Yeah, Nas-teeth saw him. He was like "Look, look!"
Welcome.
Sorry for the trouble.
No trouble at all. Anything for you, sir.
Kobe requested you.
-They seemed pleased on the last visit. -Welcome.
They're waiting.
It's been a while.
-Him? -My secretary, Buzz.
A pleasure, sir.
Brother!
My security.
Tak, a capo in the Kozu family, and Muro.
-So you're the guys… I see. -I'm Muro.
-I'm Tak. -Heard a lot about you. Strong faces.
Thank you.
Is your family siding with George again?
You mean Oliver in Nagoya?
Sorry for the nuisance.
It's just a family matter.
Am I interfering?
Oh, no. We just don't have time to pick fights.
That foreigner's a pain for us.
There are rumors…
Oliver's training Nagoya men…
…to send us a message.
"We'll destroy you"…
Recruiting foreigners…
…how to shoot, use knives.
They're tryin' to intimidate us any way they can.
I didn't invite you here for rumors.
Sorry. Nagoya's got their guard up.
I'll pay for it all.
Plant a bug, get transmitters-- I need reliable intel.
I know Oliver is connected to George.
Share our urgency, will you?
Mr. Toake, you know it's impossible. We'd be traitors.
So be it. It's time you make up your mind anyway.
Make up our--
What's Hanaoka without Kobe?
Supposing the family breaks up,
Supposing the family breaks up, Nagoya will set its target on you, no doubt.
So I'll kill George, then take Nagoya.
It's what I live for.
The boss shared his honest thoughts. Now it's your turn.
Our guests are sweating. Crank the AC.
Yes, sir.
How did we become so slavish?
Always reacting, never acting. Buzz?
You said you'd pay for it all.
Three hundred million yen, already laundered.
Use it for information.
Please.
Don't bow to us, sir, please.
Buzz!
He's good.
-He's very good. -Amazing.
-I love being tied up. -Yeah?
Like that?
Try it.
Ouch!
What else do you like?
Buzz, sit down.
Stop singing.
You new here?
I can't take anymore.
Make him stop.
I only started a week ago.
Luca's new to the business. Scold her for me if she needs it.
-Sorry. -What did you do before?
An office job at a parts supplier.
Full-time?
Yes, but the car companies started--
Got it.
Back me up.
"Ring the bell"? I oughta ring your bell!
Outta my way.
Changing singers.
I'll take another. Thanks.
-Luca, another one, please. -Yes.
You wanna sing again?
-Sir? -Take a sip.
Was I inappropriate?
Surprise test. Taste it. See if you got it right.
It's made for the boss. We can't--
Drink it.
Had too many, Tak?
I'm sober.
Sorry. I'll make--
Take a fuckin' sip!
Tak? What's going on?
Leave the girls alone.
Hey, Tak.
Luca, go to the others.
Don't.
What's up, Tak?
She has calluses on her right hand.
Years of gripping a knife,
but she's not a chef.
New girl, you have permission. Take a sip.
Learn on the job.
Careful! Cover your face!
-Get back! -Turn up the music. Keep her in.
Louder, louder!
Stop!
A newcomer? Are you a part of this?
Absolutely not!
No one in Ginza can offend the boss!
-I'd lose my business! -Slick, we need processing.
Ladies, please don't worry.
You're safe.
I've never seen a hit woman.
I'm so sorry. After all your trouble.
Sounds funny, but I learned a lot.
We need to rethink security. Totally.
Yes.
You have some good men under you.
Please stand up, ma'am.
Forgive me!
It's our fault. We were out despite being targeted.
You're a victim.
Mr. Toake.
We had fun, drinking and singing.
Yes, sir. There was never a girl named Luca here.
Outside is clear.
Take our guests back.
Yes, sir. And you?
I'll stay out.
See them out, ladies.
-Don't look so serious, you hear? -Yes, ma'am.
-Louder. -Yes, ma'am.
-Can't hear you! -Yes, ma'am!
Buck up, Chisa. Ready?
We'll do the processing.
Sure. But I'm going with you.
That won't do. The brothers would kill me.
I'm in great spirits.
Both at once.
-You got it? -I can carry 'em.
This is fine. See ya.
-Good night. -Thanks.
Why did you call Slick?
His entourage will come.
I said come alone.
Stop there.
How are ya?
Evening, sir.
Muro, Tak, be on the lookout.
Copy that.
Monitors this way.
You're here, too?
-I was-- -Here, Slick!
Pops, Sis, Uncle, what's going on?
Just get in.
I planted a bug with the cash.
-Boss's order? -Our own decision.
Tawaraya's on our side.
The boss thinks so, but not us.
-Uncle Bear? -Unsure. He agreed to the bug.
George sent Hendrickson.
They knew the boss would call Tawaraya if he found out.
Tawaraya chose the meeting place.
As always.
Right. But, then, the hit woman…
-George scripted this? -Naturally.
Could he? He's half insane.
He got a strategist.
Either way, Tawaraya was not expecting 300 million yen.
He'll go to George.
Or else Nagoya would think he's a traitor. It'd be war.
Sing.
Sing.
Watchdog? Some coffee.
-Yes, Boss. -Sing.
Come on, sing, will ya?
-Let her down, Bear. -You sure?
Yes, I'm bored.
The heart of Toshokai's darkness.
All contraband comes through here: drugs, knockoffs,
black market animals-- everything.
We killed some of the Expelled here during the feud five years ago.
I smell chemicals.
Gotta clean in the summer.
Blood seeps in the floor. Brings maggots.
Who cleans it?
Our cleanup contractors.
They're messy.
They're thorough.
They use chemicals that beat blue light.
They deodorize with ozone.
We'll call them tomorrow.
It's easy to break a girl's fingers.
Takes time and effort to break her spirit.
What about her uniform?
There's a beautiful girl.
I bought the uniform. It cost a fortune.
And then?
Then? Nothing.
-Why didn't you use it? -What?
Your ankle gun.
It was for Tawaraya, just in case.
-Pop's order? -Couldn't let Tawaraya see it.
Makes sense.
Okay, I'm going to break that bitch's spirit now.
Suppose George was smart--
-Shut up. -Huh?
Just let him speak.
Would it end after the first wave?
I'll tell you before you snap.
Tell us everything and you live.
Say nothing? We hurt you more,
till this hot thug gouges your eye with a screwdriver.
I'll strum your optic nerves, Luca.
It would be la musica of such sorrow.
So true!
-Hey, Muro? -Yeah?
Sound of a four-ounce poop. Go!
Poop?
What did you think?
-Wasn't it good? -Your grunt.
It's a big poop. You do it.
Here ya go.
-Huge, 5.5 ounces. -Nine ounces.
Nine ounces!
Mine was bigger.
Mr. Bear has the biggest.
He's sick! Sick, huge turd!
The boss went home.
Did you check? What if he went with them?
What's your point?
Bear wouldn't be followed.
I'd have the bitch swallow a tracker.
-The boss isn't home. I can't reach Bear. -Ready?
-The boss isn't home. I can't reach Bear. -Ready? Go, go.
Huh? Boss?
What's up?
Hold on.
A tracker?
They set us up.
Watchdog, the electrical panel!
I don't know where--
-Are there guns there? -Just bats and clubs.
-Pops? -You with the boss?
Yes.
What is he thinking?
It's about to get busy. Gotta go.
Go to processing.
-I'll need guns, it'd take a few hours-- -No need. It'll be over by then.
Just a stack of bodies. Take the cleaners.
I have to clean up?
-Get in the car! -All right.
I'll navigate.
A-Team, get here. ASAP.
-Boss! To the office! -Go!
-Guns! -Ain't none here.
Wait, there may be one.
-Hurry, hurry! -There might be something!
-Chauffeur! -I'll look for it!
Uncle Bear!
I'll hold them here.
Watchdog, Watchdog.
I found a gun.
The hell?
A Manville. Really loud. Ineffective.
Cops used it on a union strike in '35. Old boss got it.
-It's got cobwebs. -It was oiled.
-Will it fire? -If this turns…
Give it to me.
-I'll get rounds. -Got it.
One pound… Two pounds…
Nine enemies. They've split.
They're going up. Tak, go take 'em out.
-But… -We got it here.
Go help Bear. Go.
-Take it. -Thanks.
Give it.
-Put up a wall. -Yes, sir.
Uncle Bear!
Watch out!
-You're blocking my shot. -Sorry.
They're moving.
-Follow us. -Yes, sir!
Grunt.
Like you're pooping. Grunt for me.
Now?
Now's the moment. Now or never.
Luca…
One more.
Is the boss…
safe?
Hello?
The chauffeur?
Bear.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Should we hug, too?
No.
Okay, stop, stop.
Hurry! Start cleaning. Take pics.
We have another stop. Quickly.
A-Team took the boss home.
I know. Pops wants you.
-Got a car? -Follow me.
See how we look? Shouldn't speed too much.
Cops? Just shoot 'em.
You know, I've never shot a cop.
-Really? -I don't want to, either. Respect.
A yakuza respecting cops?
I heard a heartwarming story.
What story?
A supermarket was robbed 11 years ago.
A staff lady and three teenagers were killed.
I remember. It was awful. Crazy Chinese mafia.
I met the lady's daughter.
For six months, she's been getting an envelope of cash
with a note: "The killer has paid." Signed only "G.I."
So, where's the cop?
There was a cop stationed nearby: Goro Idezuki.
Initials are "G.I."
Right. Dope story if it's him.
Hunts the killers for 11 years and pays the victims.
So badass.
-Did the attacks work? -They didn't.
He has fierce security.
-We got your buddy. -Bear's dead?
Is this the 300-million-yen gift?
I don't understand Toake.
Gotta figure out our next step.
-Right. -Park the car.
You said hit man. I didn't expect a girl.
But I expected your song.
-Which one? -Don't you know?
-Where's Pops? -He left. Got impatient.
-When? -Five minutes ago, Emiri?
Or so. You hurt?
-Not my blood. -There'll be more.
-Wait for cleanup. -Copy.
-Nas-teeth, lead. -I'll lead.
-I'll lead-- -Nas-teeth?
Which way?
Yes, there.
-Where? -Go straight.
Nas-teeth?
He's gone. He was right behind us.
Get him!
Who the fuck are you?
What the hell is this?
Big bro!
Fuckers! Ouch!
Found you!
Big bro! Move!
Out of my way.
Just like you thought, Pops.
We'll bury Bear in secret.
-You get me? -No, sir.
Bear will go AWOL and Toshokai will disown him.
He sets off to the next world in dishonor.
He has no savings. Never paid attention to money.
Never had kids so he could die without regrets.
What about his wife?
The 300 million we got back. This goes to her.
-Just the tables for now. No chairs yet. -Bring the chairs here.
Space the bowls equally.
-Mr. Slick? -Yeah?
That story…
'bout Tak and the police box.
In Shinjuku?
-I thought Goro was the trans. -What?
The cop was shouting--
-He was calling Mr. Tak, "Goro." -Goro?
"Hey! Goro Idezuki!" From Muro's story.
The "G.I." cop.
Did you know Mr. Tak was a cop?
-Did you tell others? -No, sir.
-Don't tell anyone. -I won't.
-Go back to work. -Back to work.
-Goodbye. -You have to wait.
Bear's capo, Monma, will start a new family.
Koharu?
-Koharu? -Yes?
-Go help with the arrivals. -Yes, ma'am.
-Are you free? -Yes.
-Move. -Sorry, sir.
Hang in there. It's hard.
Koharu? Over there? Gotta change!
Over here, I brought it.
-Hurry. -Yes, sir!
Thank you for accommodating us.
I used to be a yakuza too.
Lunch is from my husband's restaurant.
Prepared with care just as Bear liked.
I hope you enjoy it.
You okay?
It's totally gone-- my appetite.
Boss,
who'll be secretary?
I wanted Toki as an interim,
but he refused.
Then, Slick?
I still have a lot to learn--
-Tak will do it. -Toki and I agreed.
From the boss.
Boss?
-Ready, sir? -Anytime.
Tak, it's your first job as secretary. Come.
Are Tak and I…?
You're no longer a team.
Pops!
Shut up and watch.
Bear died because you put yourself in danger.
Do you realize what you did?
I do.
The boss never goes to a torture site.
I'll go check.
I deserve it. I need to make it right with Bear.
Give me another.
Pops!
Shut up. Stay back!
Don't interfere.
Don't. Cutting off a finger's so passé.
It's the price I pay for hitting you.
Don't.
Tak, step on it for me. I got hard bones.
I'm your boss. Stop!
-Step on it, now. -Stop it!
-How dare-- -Quiet, Slick!
Toki hit the boss. He deserves it.
Now it's over. Got it?
Listen to me.
Toki gave me a chance to make it right.
He took the risk. I'm grateful.
Carry him out.
Toki's stubborn. He'll try again.
I know. I'll hide anything he'd try to use.
The funeral's not over.
Let's sing Bear's favorite song together.
You should be cuttin' off your finger.
You took the boss to fuckin' processing.
I'm sorry.
They may forgive you, but I won't, you fuck.
I'll rip you a new one, stuff it with leftovers.
A finger like this? You can have it anytime.
But how is it that
a Kozu capo lets a guy get behind him so easily?
Kinda embarrassing.
Fuck you, you low-life psychopath.
Stop, Muro.
Let's go.
I'm going to take a piss first.
What the…?
You fuck!
I'm risking everything to advise you.
Just like Pops showed us.
Calm down.
"Son of death row inmates"?
I never said that.
It's our work that lets you make money without fear.
Goin' too far?
Nope, not at all.
Who cares?
Wait, Muro, wait! I need your help.
It's no time for us to fight.
This must be what it's like when a killer snaps.
Your hero, Goro, the cop.
What about it?
It might be Tak!
Impossible.
It's true, ask Nas-teeth. We just need proof.
Get a better excuse to save your life.
He may be an undercover.
We need to protect Toshokai.
We got along before Tak. Remember?
Sad.
I low-key snapped.
I wish I could blame it on drugs.
I saw my parents.
Slick looks just like my dad.
Run.
Run.
Are you undercover? No, right?
No, I'm not.
I don't like that "no."
I'm…
a Hell Dog. The same as you.
I've had nightmares all my life.
But you and I… It could have been good.
I'll send you to hell with Slick!
-Where is Muro? -No idea.
There's no way he hasn't called you.
-Your phone? -Hold on.
What?
Think you'll get away with this?
Of course.
Tak!
Hunt for Muro as you like, but leave me alone.
Gotcha.
-Language. -Yes, sir.
-Can't hear. -Yes, sir!
-Let me out. -Yes, sir.
My head!
You're very bold.
Change of plans.
What was with Hendrickson?
An FBI decoy.
Went home. The real Hendrickson died two years ago in Syria--
You can't just stroll into my place like this.
One more hit.
After that, you're free. Go on vacation, retire.
We'll pay for it all.
I won't retire.
I swore to protect my families till I die.
-Families? -Four families.
Atoning for Goro Idezuki.
Kill the boss and steal the secret file?
Toake's real name is So Koreyasu.
We trained him with the FBI. He was undercover in Toshokai.
The files are his email and call records with us.
Dumbasses.
He was to split up Toshokai and cut off cash flow
to far-right pols in the US.
Illegal casinos?
International Evangelical Alliance. "Neo-Episteme." Heard of them?
He sees them a lot.
The Tokyo branch has diplomatic immunity. They built a casino.
Toake used his ins to raise his business reputation abroad.
It's your mistake.
You handle it.
Then, I'll kill you.
Tak Boy's undercover, too?
You're lovers?
You scared me!
You scared me.
You could have told me.
Would you like milk in it?
Hey, remember me?
Of course. What happened?
Nothing.
Is Anna back from Sydney?
She'll be back soon.
I think this is Goro, "G.I."
Can you ask Mr. Mamiya? I'll wait.
Can you? Ain't got time.
Here.
Poachers like elephants with big tusks.
Large adult males are killed first-- the ones that can mate.
Then they kill the matriarch, the leader of the herd.
They can't survive without her.
Elephants will go extinct unless poaching ends.
You've been there.
I was on an anti-poaching task force in Tanzania.
Fresh out of vet school.
Japanese vet. Kid of a yakuza.
Japan says it's not involved in ivory trafficking.
Fucking liars.
You know I work for the government.
I'm going to end the yakuza's ivory business.
Kill all three at once.
I'll kill Toki.
-Alone? -Of course.
And Chuji?
Someone who's waited eight years.
The wait is over.
-Morning. -Good morning.
-Mornin', ma'am. -Mornin'.
Babe?
You should be in bed.
Your fever will go up.
A bit early, but wanna do up?
Muro killed Slick.
Yes.
Who's on it?
The boss said to wait and see.
Why don't you make Tak do it?
He's secretary to the boss.
I can't make him!
You're lovers. I've known it a while.
Tak's important. That's why you're alive.
Fuckin' bitch!
You gotta be kiddin'.
Neo-Episteme today?
Yes, at 7 p.m. Mr. Dawson of International Evangelical Alliance.
Perfect. I'll introduce you.
-Have you found Muro? -Not yet.
-He'll contact you. -If he does, I'll--
Don't.
I want him to escape overseas.
Slick was a problem anyway.
Thank you.
You and I… together to the grave.
Why was my son killed?
He touched my granddaughter.
I thought she came on to him.
Maybe. Same, either way.
Little thug didn't know his place.
I never said kill him. My men inferred it. An accident.
Inferred to stab him over and over again?
What's your point?
The thing is, I can hear my son's screams even now.
Crawling up these arms.
I paid you for your loss.
Yes, you did.
Ms. N, you done already?
He's tired today. Let him sleep an hour.
Yes, ma'am.
Don't got it.
But he's got one already.
Is it worth the 30,000 yen?
Good point.
Ms. N!
My shoulders are sore.
Your boss's warmth is still in my hands. Do you dare?
Fine. Wait, where's your bag?
Didn't want to wake him. I'll get it later.
Okay.
Okay. Five minutes, that's it.
Yes!
Just be back by evening. Enjoy a fancy lunch.
Thank you, sir.
You're respectful.
You're secretary to the boss.
-Pat down by sight? -No problem.
He was an LAPD spotter.
You see where a gun is carried?
More by the gait.
-How about the type? -80% of the time.
-What's mine? -Not on you.
I'm disappointed.
Why?
You and I…
could have been friends.
I have a gun…
hidden, you see?
This is a surprise.
I came to apologize to Pops, and this?
Vengeance is mine.
Don't take it wrong.
This is just a kiss. The kiss of death.
Tak will never forgive you.
He was a cop-- tactical unit.
He's my man.
Why?
You want to know why?
Yes.
The long or short version?
Long one.
Eleven years ago,
I was a rookie cop in Shinjuku-- on 2nd Street.
Please run a check on registration number…
Sarge?
That guy has a gun.
How the hell do you know?
A Tokarev.
No conjectures, rookie.
I'm gun-spotting.
Can you say he's 100% carrying a Tokarev--
Hey, it's all you can drink!
You can't.
Gotta use all your senses, not just your eyes.
Yes, sir.
Two hours later, they robbed the supermarket.
Four killed by a Tokarev.
You called?
I want to share my secret.
I was an undercover.
When the cops came down on Toshokai, I came out to the Kozu Trio.
Told them we can outsmart the cops and the FBI.
Heart is won by heart.
They instantly decided to anoint me leader.
It's a kind of bond lacking in the deceitful authorities.
Warm-blooded brothers over an icy government.
Exactly.
Now, you've chosen me.
-Why? -To see who you really are.
Anai would surely send in a man worse than me.
You knew. When?
Just now. As we were talking.
But I've always wondered.
Just like a young girl with a flower.
He loves me… he loves me not.
Loves me… loves me not.
The A-Team's gone?
Don't be a dog.
Free yourself.
We could take over the world together.
Deep is the darkness.
I think I'm a mad dog. I only know how to bite.
It seems I was born that way.
-Besides… -Besides?
I like elephants.
-Why not my head? -Why not mine?
Where's Ms. N?
FINISHED. I'M OUT. -N.
Nothing from Emiri.
Sent a man and found Toki dead. I'll go there now.
You?
I'll pray.
Stuffin' myself to death! See ya soon.
I'm at the House of Bamboo.
Got a special guest here.
Hurry up, okay?
Video for Tak. Say something, leave a message.
Come soon, or you might regret it.
A murdered God.
What do you want, brother?
That word means a lot.
What do you want, Muro?
Three questions.
Please answer honestly.
Sure.
Are you an undercover agent, Goro?
Yes.
Who cares?
-Let's go back to the family. -It's gone.
Leaders are dead.
So, what was I to Goro?
-You asking? -Not really.
You were the King of the Wood.
"A priest seeks to kill a man. Having killed him,
he is soon killed himself."
I don't get it, but it sounds dope.
I got this far because…
you were with me.
Last question.
-Can I avenge Pops? -It's over, Muro.
Last question.
That was your last.
Which will it be? Me or this bitch?
Started with Mad Dog,
ends with Hell Dog.
-We do the kiss of death. -Right?
Am I right?
-Should we? -Right? Do the kiss of death.
-Right on the mouth. -He won't give up.
Hey, you.
What the hell ya doin'?
We closed an hour ago.
You Japanese?
You're making us look bad.
Look at this guy.
Hold on! Let's calm down and eat our yummy dinner.
Hey, stop.
This guy's legit.
This is wicked fun!

BOOKKEEPING SKILLS
Nothing special.

Wait.
She's livestreaming tomorrow. No harm done to her face, right?
-No. -Hey, speaking of injuries…
Look at my finger.
I caught it in the car door just now.
It hurt so much.
Shut up, Zura!
-Hey! -Bald blabbermouth!
Pretty uninventive insult!
Give it back. Don't play with it! You'll ruin the shape.
-Eyes front. -Please, give it back.
I'm not joking, give it back.
Endure insults about your hair.
Establish physical contact.
It's all to help vulnerable girls.
I'm fine, actually.
See, I've got a dream.
It's good to have a dream, no matter how small.
So, what's your dream now?
Why, of course…
to pass Level 2 of the Bookkeeping Proficiency Test.
Assets minus liabilities equal capital.
But in corporate law and such,
the difference is referred to on the balance sheet
as "net worth."
Hey, Kei?
-Liabilities are called… -Kei?
Come on. Focus, Rikka.
Hey! Stop!
Come on.
Do you have to be so childish?
Sorry.
Right, let's continue.
If assets minus liabilities equals capital,
then on the balance sheet…
I'M THE CULPRIT, HE'S THE MOVER
Here it is!
I always knew you'd be into this stuff.
Next up…
I bestow upon thee one of these dojinshi,
fanzines which we also call "thin books."
Thank you very much.
This is phenomenal!
Look, it's porn.
You're into this stuff, Kikuno?
Be gone, you villains!
Ouch.
Huh?
Sorry. Just a sec.
I'll pay for us both, driver.
What?
Um…
Yes?
Thanks for that.
I'll pay you back.
You got change for a 1,000-yen bill?
I'm 30 yen short.
It's fine.
Pay me the rest next time.
Yes, I'll pay you back next time.
Promise.
Thank you.
MEMBERS ONLY
RAMEN WELCOME
Hey, Kei.
Why's there a dead guy there?
My daughter poisoned him.
Cleaners aren't here yet.
Zura, find someone new.
Slackers are so unprofessional.
Boss!
Kei, quit being so clingy.
Don't wanna.
Boss!
Me too--
Ouch! My golden balls!
Kei, eat some ramen before you go.
Wait, I forgot.
Sorry, Zura.
Here.
Kei, you can't bring that stuff back home.
That's why I apologized.
What's with that attitude?
You should be more aware as a pro--
No, you should be more aware.
Boss, your leg! I took a hit so I could grab the foot!
Damn it, Zura!
We're only open to members. There's a sign outside.
Sorry.
I'm Watanabe.
Zura, move the drunk out back.
-Take that toy too. -Yes, ma'am.
Toy?
What a shock.
I thought it was an assassin's den.
Well, if you're Kei's friend…
why don't you two have some ramen before you go?
Thank you.
You…
should have just left.
What?
Thank you.
This is…
-It's… -Now I have to eat it too.
We really should've just left.
It's like cold, rotten noodles.
Watch it, bowl cut.
You're right, tastes like rubber.
Never thought I'd see you make that face.
What face?
This face.
Hands up, whoever fed me weird drugs!
Put your hands up!
Hands up!
Sorry, seems my daughter messed up the drugs.
No excuses.
Ready, Kei?
You wanna kill me?
-Here I go, Zura. -Alrighty.
Hey!
-Watanabe. -Huh?
Sorry for punching you.
Here you go.
Thanks.
I love you.
Your bulletproof wig is pretty sturdy.
Boss?
Go ahead.
This just feels good…
Just disappear.
What do we do with the kid, Boss?
I'm looking for some part-time work.
I'll do anything.
Let it slide this time.
Right? Let it go.
Listen.
I live by a three-strike rule.
You apologize while you're eating.
No, you see…
I didn't mean to betray the Denma-gumi.
Something just came over me.
-You understand that, right? -And also…
you try to attack me by surprise.
Your current count is…
two strikes.
Rules make a man.
Disaster awaits those who forget the rules.
That disaster is me.
Michitaka!
It's Mr. Michitaka to you.
Show some respect to the forces of nature.
How could you forget?
That's your third strike. Out.
You demon!
Die!
Take it with a smile…
-Hello, sir. -Hello.
-Hello, sir. -Hello.
-Hello, sir. -Hello.
Hello, sir.
Hello.
Mr. Michitaka.
No problems?
Father.
I solve problems on the spot.
You're a pro with pro-blems.
What's up with you guys?
Wasn't it funny?
It's a real dad joke.
Come on.
How can you let Dad's jokes fall flat?
Well?
First, an update.
According to the lawyers,
Sandaime's sure to be incarcerated. The verdict will take three months.
I might be away for a long time.
Family feuds could get messy.
Kunitsu.
I'm counting on you.
Okay.
It's a great opportunity.
I need to start thinking about who will succeed me
and take over the Denma-gumi.
Right, Kinoshita?
The rules are simple.
My successor will be
whoever is strongest, rakes in the most cash,
and above all, is the most loyal to the clan.
Now.
Show me how faithful you are.
Yes, sir.
Faith, faith, faithful…
Hello, sir.
Hello.
Hello, sir.
Hello.
It's finally the henchmen's time to shine.
First, let's bleed Dad's coffers dry.
We've already pooled 100 million into a separate account.
Well, at this rate,
we could easily cook up a 200-million bribe.
Sandaime is already pacified.
But can you fool the safe-keeper?
Terano?
He's a worthless piece of snot.
Like that.
-Kaneko. -Yes?
Use Ayabe's cash to bolster our ranks.
My idea is simple too.
If all the executive members die…
then the Denma-gumi will be mine.
President Ayabe.
Sorry to disturb you.
Well, well.
If it isn't Terano.
You surprised me.
Denma-gumi's esteemed money-handler!
So…
what's with the long face?
Forgive my bluntness,
but could I see the company accounts?
Of course, old chap.
Look at whatever you like.
By the way…
AYABE FINANCE
Do you have the right to nitpick?
Denma-gumi makes most of its money from trading stocks. Isn't that right?
If you were to say anything stupid,
you'd regret it.
Like a certain someone did.
Just Yusa today.
You go home.
You--
Hello from the Kunitsu-gumi.
Wait, wait!
Wait! Yusa, help!
Three. "Kitty found some money."
"You receive 30,000 dollars."
Meow.
-Creepy. -Sure is.
Pisses me off.
Hey, brat.
You're playing this game thanks to who?
Who exactly got you this job?
-I don't need to hear this. -You little--
Hey.
Four. "You trade houses with your kind neighbor to the right."
Nice!
I'll trade this cheap house for your most expensive--
Hey!
What are you doing?
Sorry, my hand just slipped.
Huh? What?
Sorry, my hand just slipped.
Now you've really done it.
You've opened Pandora's box.
Hey! What do you think you're doing?
Come on, pull yourselves together.
Hey! Give it back!
-Give it back! -Don't touch my Kei!
What?
Hey. Did you just touch my butt?
You did, didn't you?
No, no.
It's just, this--
Don't give me that cheeky look!
Right? Okay?
Give me my wig back.
Don't touch her!
Thank you for choosing…
If it's Zura's fault--
…Delivery Service.
Shut up, you deadbeats! Or you'll end up in my ramen as mincemeat!
Sorry.
Thanks for waiting.
For Kinoshita-gumi, yes?
She got angry at me as well because of you two.
-We're on the way. -It's your fault.
Kei, you've got a job.
Alright.
SHOSEN MEDICAL CENTER
There must be hidden accounts elsewhere.
Hey, calculator boy.
What are you looking at?
There's a discrepancy between what's on the balance sheet and the value of stocks traded using Denma-gumi money.
Put it in layman's terms for me.
A traitor is stealing money from the top
to create a secret stash of cash.
The one pulling the strings…
must be Kinoshita.
KUNITSU VS KINOSHITA -Here's the case. -Look, Watanabe.
-Here's the case. -Look, Watanabe.
Look at the kitty.
So cute.
Cheers me up.
Hey, brat.
Listen to what the boss says!
That hurt.
This time…
TODAY'S CLIENT
…we're working directly for Kinoshita-gumi's boss.
Kinoshita-gumi?
He's the second in command of Denma-gumi, the biggest yakuza gang in eastern Japan.
Kinoshita has both brains and brawn.
He's bolstering his troops using money earned from stock trades
thanks to the CEO of their front company, Ayabe.
Ayabe has been abducted.
He was abducted by the Kunitsu-gumi, led by Denma-gumi's oldest member.
Kunitsu lost a lot of money following some insider info from Ayabe.
Kunitsu and Kinoshita are battling to inherit the Denma-gumi leadership.
And now…
tonight, Kinoshita finally steps into the ring.
-He steps into the ring! -War is so pointless.
You're pointless.
So?
What will you do?
I'll destroy them.
Naturally.
I didn't expect to see the top dog himself come in.
We lost 20 million because of that fraudster.
We have to deal with him appropriately.
Hey.
Will this take care of it?
It's 100 million.
One hundred million?
That's excessive.
Makes a tradesman like me suspect something underhanded is going on.
This is to show how faithful I am.
How transparent. It's a bit late for that.
Fine. Go ahead.
Yes, sir.
Kei, it's almost time.
Okay.
What about Daria?
-Daria? -She's a new recruit.
She's a ghosting expert.
She's always ready to go.
Back to work.
Yes, sir.
Now it begins.
Who are you? What do you want?
I'm Kei from Supple 'n' Natural Gals Delivery Service.
What kind of place do you think this is? Go home.
Ow, it hurts.
What's wrong?
My belly hurts. Can I use your toilet?
Beat it.
What? That's not what I was told.
Phew, I'm glad. Good evening.
Hashiguchi let the call girl inside.
What's going on?
Hey, Hashiguchi.
-Woah! -Hey!
What are you doing?
Me?
I work for Supple 'n' Natural Gals Delivery--
That's not what I'm asking, idiot!
Are you satisfied?
You just love killing people?
You do it for kicks?
Well?
Our henchmen are worthless, puny bugs to you?
It's my job.
You've certainly done a good job.
Right, Hashiguchi?
How pathetic.
You got thugs like this involved?
You kill him.
More interesting that way.
Sir, I'll do anything but that.
You chose to play the traitor.
So there was another one.
Really did do a good job.
Hey, assassin.
Yes?
Please tell Daria…
next time she's playing with me.
Kei.
Suddenly, it's all clear to me.
What? Seriously?
SPOT THE DIFFERENCE
What?
Is it the lunchboxes?
The kid's clothes?
Number of flowers?
The picnic blanket design?
I hate to ask, but give me a hint.
What? An insect?
The worthless, puny little bug at the top. It's flying three millimeters higher here.
You shouldn't call insects nasty things like that.
Really?
I'll be more careful.
Yum, it's delicious.
By the way,
how's the bookkeeping going?
You enjoying it?
I'm not sure.
But…
But I'm trying one thing at a time…
to figure out what I could do.
That's where I'm at.
One thing, then another.
Very gradually.
Kei.
It's okay… to change.
And also,
everything must come to an end.
Full of life
I'm the first in line
Leaping hungrily
What a great song.
This will always be
A dog-eat-dog world
Scatter feed in front of a person's eyes,
and you can see what they're truly like.
Our clan has become very much like that person.
The killer was a young female assassin, apparently.
Female?
A young girl.
A young…
A young girl!
It was a young girl!
Bring her to me. Don't be coy…
they're just koi.
I don't care about the dead people.
But a female assassin rubs me the wrong way.
There's something in Ayabe Finance's accounts that doesn't add up.
The funds requested from the Denma-gumi for stock trades are excessive.
The extra money has gradually been siphoned into a separate account.
It's about 300 million in total.
Have you heard of the San people?
They're modern-day hunters.
When they spot their prey…
first they weaken them with poison darts
before killing them.
If we're killing Kinoshita,
let's weaken him first.
Get more evidence.
At the moment it's still hard to get him.
Or get him hard?
I hear you're looking after Kura.
He's already broken.
Father!
I imagined you two as the backbone of Denma-gumi.
How foolish I was.
Daria, you can't live in hotels forever.
I've got a hot property for you.
Earthquake-proof.
Blast-proof.
Thick concrete walls.
A steel-plated safe room.
This is fine. Anywhere's fine.
That's the wrong attitude, Daria.
The walls are bare concrete.
The toilet and bath aren't separated.
What? Isn't there a separate washbasin?
Right, you wouldn't understand, Zura.
-You don't have any hair, after all. -That's mean.
-Meanie. -Okay, this is fine.
Don't be so indifferent.
It's fun spending time room-hunting.
I wish I could think that way too.
Alright, just one.
-What? -Tell us one dream you have.
That's how you start.
A dream?
This roof balcony is great.
You found my kind of place.
It's a bit expensive though. Is that okay?
Yeah.
I like it here.
I can't lose what I don't have.
That's why I had… nothing.
It's easier if you have things.
Sometimes.
Let's get busy. So we don't lose this place.
-You're an odd one. -What?
My parents were killed by other yakuza who thought they snitched.
They took me away
and taught me how to kill people.
I want to… end this suffering.
I'll help you… Daria.
Why did you start this job, Kei?
I…
Game…
start.
Run away.
Mr. Michitaka.
I live by a three-strike rule.
-What? -Women, yet you kill for a living.
Women, yet you crush the Kunitsu-gumi.
Women, living as women.
That's already three strikes. You're out.
Know the word "misogynist"?
Some kind of foul miso soup?
It refers to outdated bigots like you.
Old man!
Such a foul-mouthed whore.
Daria!
I'll punish you slowly later.
Women…
My assistants are all out on other cases.
You have experience, right?
Then come with me.
-Who, me? -Yes.
I gotta clean the car up, bowl cut.
Okay.
All the yakuza use this hospital.
There's a "no funny business" rule.
Okay.
Still, there are some funny sorts about.
I'm counting on you.
Leave the chatting to the bosses.
Wanna die in a place like this?
No… but if there's something to discuss…
then speak to me.
-To you? -You clearly just headbutted me.
On neutral ground.
I won't make a big deal about it.
So please leave.
I'll use a blowtorch to roast your eyes, 20 minutes each.
I said, leave already.
Man, how exhausting.
I'm parched.
Hey, assassin.
What happened to Daria?
I don't have to tell you.
How about I pin you all down the moment you leave here?
No thanks. I don't mind, though.
Right, Watanabe?
Yep.
You're nuts.
Seems like I'm made for this job.
If you are… you'll die early.
If it's for you, Kei,
I don't mind dying a little earlier.
Are you made for this job?
It's better if you're not.
I don't want you to die early.
-Your head's too high. -What?
You did a good job today.
Well done.
Here.
Wait, no, no.
You creep.
-What's with the tea? -This?
It's the tea of love. Love tea.
Love tea? How silly.
What the heck?
Don't mess with me!
You're so nasty, Zura!
Haven't you ever fallen in love?
You don't understand how I feel being in love!
You trying to kill me?
So how does it feel?
Tell me, what's love to you?
For me, love is…
Love is…
-a cactus! -Boring. Try again.
-A hula dancer-- -You're just describing these figurines.
-A hula dancer-- -You're just describing these figurines. -A tree-- -Like this one!
-A tree-- -Like this one!
Oh, dear.
Didn't expect to meet you again here.
For sure.
You're 20 yen short.
Sorry, I don't have it.
Seriously? I'll charge interest next time.
Is it this person's birthday or something?
I guess so.
I like it when guys are close friends.
I always play the white in Othello.
Really? Why?
I want to make the whole board light up.
Just the once.
Game over.
I'll… leave.
Well…
The board may be mostly dark at the moment,
but if the last piece turns white just before death,
it could all suddenly light up.
Says the player using black!
You nervous, calculator boy?
ONE MONTH EARLIER
Shut up.
Hey!
Kura? Kura!
Hey, calculator boy.
Are you awake?
Yeah.
I'm eating your birthday cake for you.
Terano.
You want to quit, right?
-But you can't because of me. -Stop it.
Don't talk nonsense.
I want some coffee.
What are you talking about?
I want to at least enjoy the aroma.
A Denma-gumi member committed suicide.
His friend blamed the clan and ran off with the money.
Our job this time
is to deal with him.
The work will be more dangerous than ever.
"Dangerous than ever."
"Everlasting soup."
"Super-tease."
What?
Well…
"Cheesecake yellow"!
What? That's a stretch!
So, "-low"?
Lo…
-"Locomotive standstill." -Still…
Still up for it?
Or not?
What will you do?
I'll do it.
I'll see any job through.
Well… eat some tasty ramen before you go.
Do you have a dream?
What?
I want to go to New York.
I want to see the real Statue of Liberty.
I want to have fun with blonde girls.
Get better and go, then.
This is the best.
And?
How much was it?
The 100 million from Sandaime…
and the separate account.
He stole the hidden funds.
Why did Terano do it?
Sorry, sir.
Seems like he figured us out.
Useless idiot.
Useless!
Hands up.
What'll you do now?
I mean, it's already over.
Seriously?
You're an assassin?
I was surprised too.
If I give you the money…
I guess that won't help.
If you want to say a final prayer or have your last cigarette,
now's the time.
I can't die yet.
Excuse me.
What is it, Zura?
What?
Got it.
Sorry.
What?
Apparently, management is discussing whether or not to kill you right away.
I see.
How about a break?
What?
What are you doing?
I'm studying bookkeeping.
Got a mock test next week and I haven't studied.
So you're doing it now? I knew you were crazy.
You shouldn't talk about people like that.
You can learn anywhere if you try.
That's how I see it.
I can help if you get stuck.
What? You can?
DENMA-GUMI
And?
How much was it?
One hundred million.
He really got us.
Sure about the amount?
It's 100 million.
No mistake.
I see.
Terano phoned me last night.
Sorry to call you so late.
I'll speak frankly.
I'm stealing 130 million yen from you.
What I'm stealing is 100 million from Ayabe Finance
and 30 million they're secretly keeping in a separate account.
If Kinoshita doesn't mention the 30 million
and says only 100 million has been stolen…
then that proves the secret funds were collected at Kinoshita's orders.
Kinoshita…
Anything you want to say?
Ayabe…
I had not heard about this.
Sorry?
Why didn't you tell me about the 30 million in the separate account?
What?
This is really how you wanna play it?
All my fault, is it?
Don't talk down to me, underling.
Go on then, shoot.
Shoot, shoot!
You've got guts.
Die.
Why do you… get to decide that?
Same for you.
Same for you.
I'm the one who decides your expiry dates.
Something stinks.
You two stink.
You're already rotting.
In that case,
to stop the rot,
first bring back the money!
Okay?
I'll get it to you.
In these payable accounts, we only convert 600,000 dollars' worth
at the exchange rate on the settlement date.
The advance here is a dummy figure so don't convert it.
The advance here is a dummy figure so don't convert it. Shows how important dummy figures are.
I see.
You're a good teacher.
Right, Teach?
"Teach"?
What about this?
This?
Hello?
Terano.
You really got us.
I want to make a deal with you.
What?
Here's the money I stole.
If you tell me the truth, I'll return it all.
And?
What do you want to hear?
Tell me about Kura.
You ordered his hit, right?
I don't remember.
He got cocky because Sandaime liked him.
That's all.
Let me tell you about your own future.
Troops will be arriving soon.
They'll cut you up alive.
Roast you.
Melt you down.
That's what's in store for you.
I never intended to live a long time.
And…
I never expected you to speak the truth.
What?
Hey!
Hey, don't be stupid!
You're finished, Kinoshita.
He's really done it.
-Kaneko. -Yes.
Gather all our troops and weapons.
Once you're handed over, I'll leave too.
Right.
Terano.
No hard feelings, but it's time for a painful death.
Thanks for helping with my studies, Teach.
Good luck with the exams.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Is she really that strong?
Stop it.
Leave her out of it.
It's like how skinny chicks always win eating competitions.
But she's so vulnerable.
Over here!
I changed my mind.
Can you do some work for me?
Of course.
Sorry about all this.
It's fine.
I don't bring my emotions to work.
Maybe a little.
What will you do now, Teach?
I wonder.
I'd only thought about my death.
You should have a dream.
Something you want.
Kura said… he wanted to go to New York.
Really? New York?
What the hell?
MICHITAKA CLEANING
It's the three-strikes guy.
Who?
Hey!
He's Denma-gumi's best assassin. Break his rules and you're out.
He never forgives.
He chases you till you're dead.
Forever.
What the hell?
No time for flirting!
Now, bowl cut!
Okay.
Time to get serious!
We've only got one shot. Aim well.
Alright!
-I did it! -Alright!
Deary, deary me.
What a filthy car.
Damn! Tank's empty!
Oh no! What should we do?
What can we do?
Perfect.
You're here too… woman.
It's my job.
For now…
let's run!
Who you gonna call? Me, and here I am.
No one called you, stupid!
Kei, go with Terano.
The boss readied a helicopter at the dam ahead.
Don't go too hard.
You two are my opponents?
We can buy some time, at least.
Idiots.
What's wrong with your head?
Use your imagination.
-Bowl cut? -Yeah!
Wait, sorry!
Take this!
A spray custom-made using the strongest chilies in the world.
See that? Go home!
You idiot!
Let's play a game.
What? Now, of all times?
Think of five great things about New York.
The Statue of Liberty.
Times Square.
And cheesecake or whatever.
Cheesecake? I love cheesecake.
So incessant.
No one likes an incessant man, you know.
Shut it, pink girl.
Hey, Terano.
First, return the money.
I'll punish you slowly afterwards.
I burned it all.
I even filmed it.
You seem like a very prudent man.
That was a decoy.
Now play your trump card.
Don't overestimate me.
Run away.
I can't.
This is my job.
I understand.
You done?
You worthless fish of a woman.
You've been chosen as the best of our clan.
But today…
half of you will probably die.
It's that kind of fight, and it starts now.
If you want to leave, go!
The plan is simple.
First kill Terano, the man who took the money.
Then kill Michitaka, the cleaner.
Then…
we kill Sandaime.
Hey.
What happened to her?
You're interested in dead fish?
You bastard.
You're both here together.
Saves us the trouble of finding you.
What's this?
More new trash?
Keep going! Kill him!
You stupid brat!
Kinoshita.
You're out.
You're dancing!
You're not very good.
It's all in the hips.
Here goes.
Hop.
Step.
What a strange twist of fate.
I'm the one killing you, too.
You're the one person I'll never forgive.
You're talkin' shit.
Play nice with your bestie on the other side.
It's her.
Wait.
You taught me never to wait.
Kei?
Kei?
Do you have a dream?
But…
I get tired sometimes too.
Dreams are good. For yourself.
For people you care about.
No matter how small it is,
nurture your dream, slowly.
Kikuno?
Kikuno?
Are you okay?
Watanabe?
What a stupid question. Look at her, she's obviously fine.
You're so annoying. What should I ask, then?
Kei, come on.
Chest to chest.
Don't touch her, baldy!
Stupid bowl cut!
Don't touch! Hands off, slowly.
Drop your hands slowly.
Ouch!
-Don't touch me! -Don't call me baldy!
-Baldy. Baldy. -Apologize. Apologize!
-Ouch… -I just had a dream.
It was a nice dream.
I can't be finished in a place like this.
It's not over for me.
The dam's just outside.
What about Kei?
Don't worry.
That--
You called? Michitaka.
Mr. Michitaka.
Was that a mosquito bite?
Hey, Terano.
You can't break the rules.
You're polluting the atmosphere.
So die, immediately.
Sorry I'm late, Teach.
Kei.
Glad you're okay.
Hey, fish woman.
Don't interfere.
Mr. Michitaka.
Those nails really hurt,
but I got used to them.
What?
It's good to have rules.
But you shouldn't force them on other people.
Giving me your opinion…
means you're out.
I told you, I'm used to those nails.
I see.
Well, then…
What about her?
Is she used to them too?
You're really like a heel.
I…
am a hero.
Teach!
Thank you.
I'll go until the chorus.
Me, losing?
That's not in the rules.
Managed to get somewhere after all.
Thanks.
I enjoyed it.
You're a weird one.
Is that a compliment?
Maybe, yeah.
I was sure I was going to die.
If you have a dream, no matter how small…
you'll find a way to survive.
Let's go eat cheesecake.
I want you to come with me to New York.
I think that's…
my biggest dream.
I…
Teach?
Hey, Supple Gal!
Don't move!
To think you cleaned up that monster…
Terano…
it's settled now.
The godfather stands on a mountain of corpses.
This is the summit.
You got a thing for her?
In that case, you kill her.
More interesting that way.
Kinoshita, I beg you.
Please let her go.
Wrong.
That's not what you're supposed to say.
Please.
I hid the money.
I have the safe key.
That's more like it.
Hey.
Hand it over.
You…
That's enough.
Your daddy's dead.
Let's all stop the pointless killing.
They're dead.
Kinoshita, Terano, Michitaka.
As you wished, the clan's big wigs are all dead.
The clan should be safe during your whole sentence.
Leave everything to me from now on.
What? I can't hear you well.
I said, from now on--
Wait, Father.
Let's talk.
Father, wait! No!
It's a dad joke.
Funny, right?
It was funny.
You…
You're still green.
Raise them, rob them.
Raise them, then rob them.
That's the way we work.
Sorry I was late.
But the job's done now, Kei.
-This is-- -Zura.
Lend me 30 yen.
Sure, but…
Finally paid you back.
I'm tired. I want to go for a soak.
Kei, don't hold back.
Come into my arms.
Don't be creepy, Zura.
This place is members-only.
Today's an exception.
Delicious.
I've never tasted ramen this good.
Thanks.
Wow.
Delicious.
I'll be back.
You need to listen better. Don't come back.

Quan, jump! Jump!
Dad, are you scared?
Dad, stop! Please, stop!
Dad… I'm scared. Please stop!
Ah! It's a leech, Dad!
Gosh, you're scared by a leech?
Have you remembered how to get the leech off?
Yes, Dad!
Hey, hold it.
Dad, but I'm scared.
Hold it!
To my dad, the only way to overcome fears is to confront them.
My way is way simpler.
As long as I am next to a woman,
all my fears will just vanish.
Don't you know?
Since we met, my head has kept aching terribly.
What happened, honey?
Because you have been running around my mind.
I can't stop thinking of you. How can I not get headaches?
That's naughty of you!
I have never let anyone do that to me.
Do what?
Sleep in my heart.
Gia Linh! Don’t you know this world is full of temptations?
I know, honey.
That's why you are my only safe harbor.
Land on me now, babe.
But there is a fear that keeps chasing me.
That is…
my fear of heights.
What’s wrong with you?
Do you dare to jump off for me?
Jump.
-Dad. -Jump.
I'm scared.
Jump.
Dad, I'm scared.
-Jump! -I'm scared.
Daddy, Daddy.
Gosh, how could you sleep like that, Lan?
You dare to ask me?
What?
This is the 21st time this month you kick me off the bed.
Have I slept over at your place 21 days this month?
That's a lot.
-What do you mean? -Not that.
I mean, 21 times are quite a lot.
That's it?
Go away!
Lan? Hey, baby.
When I come over tonight, don't throw me out like last time.
Don't be mad at me.
I will make it up for you tonight.
Bye, baby! Love you.

I do.
-You're naughty! -What's wrong?
-Want to hang out with me tonight? -Quan.
Give me a hand! Hurry up!
Hold the baby for me please!
Do you have 20 thousand dong? The driver is waiting!
Do you have 20 thousand dong?
Hurry! He is waiting.
Oh yes.
Okay, thank you.
So familiar! Is she your friend?
She is calling your name.
Hey, hold the baby for me.
-I need to call that girl back here. -Nope! She's yours!
Don't forget our date tonight, babe.
Hey, girl!
Hey!

Bro, help me chase after that motorbike please!
Are you crazy? How can I catch them with my cyclo?
Bro! I can.
-How can he catch up? -Hurry up man!
This way. Why are you signaling with your arm?
I have to follow the rules.
-Turn! Turn! -Don't push me!
Speed up!
-Turn left. -No, we cannot!
The Cambodian border is nearby.
I need to grab my passport at home.
Oh gosh! Just catch them before reaching the border.
-Hurry up, please! -Are you sure?
-Faster. -Linh.
-Linh. Why did you leave the baby with me? -Speed up, please!
Your wife left you?
I dumped her a long time ago.
-Now she leaves me with this baby. -Speed up.
-Come on. -Okay, okay.
Faster, bro!
What happened?
-What happened? -We've run out of gas!
Gosh! How could a driver let his own vehicle run out of gas?
-Hey. -What now?
To cool your head down.
You are so nosy. Hurry up!
I really hate a playboy who was dumped by his wife.
Figure it out yourself, man!
Hey!
Didn't he say he ran out of gas?
Hey, Linh? What are you doing?
Quan, she is our daughter.
-Please help me raise her. -No! Linh, I can't!
I'm sorry.
Hello?
Hello?
Hey there.
Hi, my name is Tha May.
Can you please give me a ride?
Go!
Tha May, "I have a rattle toy.
Is the chubby guy home?"
Yes, he is!
Can you speed up, May?
We have a baby onboard.
If you slow down, we will lose sight of the mom of this baby, May.
What's up, May?
May, can we speed up?
Right! We're in hurry!
Definitely! If we lose sight of her, this baby will become an orphan, May!
-Help me, please! -Okay, I'll help you.
Come on, May! Speed up!
May! How can we catch them at this speed?
Don't worry! This is the shortcut to the border gate.
Seems like our fate together ends here.
Hope that you will find a new stroke of fate in 300 meters.
Wait!
Thank you so much, bro!
All roads lead to Rome!
Wish you success!
Here you go.
Thank you!

Where are you going?
Can you please let me in?
Where is your passport?
I was in a hurry, so I left my passport at home.
If you didn't bring your passport, please step aside!
Can you please do me a favor?
Pass this baby to the lady running over there!
Am I joking with you? Get out please!
Oh my God! Why does nobody love me?
Linh!
Linh!
Quan?
-Tam? -Hey, it's me.
This is the only way you can catch up with the mother.
If you enter the city, you can never find her.
Are you sure?
Don't worry! I swear it will work.
Get off.
Have we arrived yet, Sneaky Tam?
Almost there.
You said that a million times.
Are you sure?
Gosh, I beg you. Don't let her cry.
We will all get caught if she keeps crying.
Beg her, not me!
That's your baby. You do it.
She won't stop.
Soothe her, man.
Come on, stop crying!
We will find you milk once we get there.
Are we there yet?
Almost there! We'll reach there at the end of this path.
Hop on, hop on.
Get off, get off.
What's going on?
-What should we do now? -Run away!
Hey, Sneaky Tam!
Yes, Mr. Tin?
Mr. Tin,
I just wanted to help my friend.
His baby is still too little,
her mom has just left them,
and he can't afford to raise the child by himself.
It's all your fault!
I told you! Bring your papers along, then I would give you a ride.
Why did you drag me into these…
We are violating the law!
-Sneaky Tam! -Yes, sir!
I have already verified your case.
We have printed out the photos of the baby's mother
and have started searching for her.
Sign this form and go home.
Don't do anything reckless again!
This is the border area.
-We don't allow illegal trespassing. -I understand!
Why did you tell me we would succeed?
So that's it.
That's what? You told me it was guaranteed.
You didn't have any papers, so I had to take that path.
Stop! Stop! Pull over here!
Damn it!
Pull over here for what?
What?
Ugh! So stinky! Help me out!
Oh, the baby just pooped. Just change the diaper. That's easy.
I don't know how to do that.
Hey, hey.
Please help me. I can't take it.
You suck!
I want to throw up so bad!
I have never seen a father like you.
Take this off for me.
You have to take off this part first.
-What's that? -Lower your head so you can take it off
Gosh, I'm gonna die!
Okay, there you go.
What a little girl!
Pass me the new diaper. What are you staring at?
Come on! Good girl!
If my wife Tu were here, she would take you home with her.
Which one is the diaper?
You don't even know what a diaper looks like?
I really don't.
You're the worst, man!
Is that really a girl?
Is she even your daughter?
I just found out about her.
That's okay.
Okay, all done!
You'll come back to your father, little cutie.
Hold her carefully. I will drive.
Hold on!
Why do you act like you want to avoid her?
You're such an irresponsible father!
-What's that? -From your baby.
Oh my God, it's disgusting.
Why do you smear that on me?
Now go home, get the documents then stay overnight at my house.
I will take you tomorrow morning.
Dad, I want to hold the baby!
Little Princess. Just stay away!
You don't know anything. Stay away!
I know.
-Little Princess. -Giau, Sang, Toi, Roi.
Help me prepare water to bathe the baby.
Go, go. Quick.
Let's get ready.
You should go take a shower too.
You are dirty from working all day.
Don't carry her like that and make her cry!
-May I hold her a bit more? -Take a shower now!
Hello, Uncle Hai. It's me, Quan.
Do you know where Linh is?
I would like to apologize to her.
Hello, hello?
Here you are, Mom.
I will give you a bath, little cutie!
Put that pillow down there for me.
Here is the towel, Mom.
Okay, let me handle this.
Lay her down here.
How cute!
Drink first. I will drive you around to look for her tomorrow.
What if we can't find her again tomorrow?
We will do it again the day after.
What if we still can't find her then?
Then a whole month. We'll find her anyway.
If we can't find her after a month,
it's definitely your karma.
How could you be such a playboy?
Stop dwelling on my past, please!
Let's drink.
My house is close to the border.
You both should stay here.
Share the food cost with us. That's all.
-Is this all you have? -Yeah, that's all I have.
Just keep it! When you collect more, you can share the cost with us later.
This amount is nothing, man!
Okay, give it to me!
I'll keep it to buy milk for your daughter.
You don't have any experience in raising a child anyway.
Don't take her around. It won't be good for her health.
Leave her here. We'll give you a hand.
My wife is right.
Tam, you sound so drunk now.
Go inside and sleep. You'll leave early tomorrow.
She took our booze!
Yeah!
Why didn't you say anything?
Every house needs a roof.
-Right. -She is the roof.
What can I say?
You are pretty incredible!
How could you earn enough money for five to six members in your family?
It's all from my wife.
She trades anything she can
and is also the agent for actors in this area.
What does that mean?
It means whenever film crews need local extras,
my wife will organize them.
Spare me a little of your drink.
It's been a while since I could drink like this.
Tam, bedtime!
Your mother is calling you!
Okay, you should also go to bed soon.
I will give you a ride tomorrow.
I wish that we had a baby sister like her, Mom!
No, this is Uncle Quan's daughter.
I wonder what her name is.
She looks like a little bunny.
Her name must be Bunny.
How could her name be Bunny? It's so silly!
Giau, Sang, Toi, Roi!
Yes, Mom.
Giau, Sang, come share the bed with your dad.
Toi, Roi, you guys come sleep with me.
Let Uncle Quan and the baby stay in the attic.
Yes, Mom.
Let's go.
-Good night, Uncle Quan. -Good night, kiddos!
Uncle Quan, what's your baby's name?
Bunny.
See? I told you. Her name is Bunny.
Believe me.
See.
Here's yours.
Have you seen this lady?
No, I haven't.
Have you seen this lady?
Thank you, Uncle!
INTERNATIONAL BORDER
Have you seen this lady?
Still haven't found her?
So Bunny can stay longer with Momma Tu.
Are you that happy?
You went a little too far.
-Who are you talking about? -You.
Are you happy that she won't have a mom?
Why are you laughing?
Gosh.
If you weren't here, I would have kicked your dad's ass.
Don't you dare come here!
Everyone in the village knows that
you have an illegitimate child now. Go away.
KIM PHUONG JEWELRY
Quan, you even visit Buddhist temples now?
Everyone has to deal with their own fate and karma.
One should live without thoughts, without sorrows in this world.
You really want to get rid of her?
I stopped working this whole month to take you to look for her mom.
I thought you had changed your mind.
How could you think of leaving her at the temple?
What should I do then? Raise her?
I don't even know whether she is my daughter
or is from another of Linh's love affairs
and she just put the responsibility on me.
Don't you see? Since the first day she was here,
I couldn't even go out.
So you think she is not your child?
Do you dare swear that you didn't sleep with Linh?
Do you dare swear that Bunny is not your child?
Do you?
Now you don't want to raise her, do you?
We'll take care of her!
Okay.
Let's do that.
Your mom left you, but did your dad abandon you?
How can you abandon her now?
Don't you find it cruel?
We will adopt her.
When she grows up,
if you ever want to take her back,
I will break your legs.
Your mom left you, but did your dad abandon you?
Why do you want to abandon her now?
Dad.
Dad, what can I do?
I'm scared.
Skinny Tu, we have another princess!
What?
Quan gave little Bunny to us, darling!
-Really? -Right.
Oh, Mommy's treasure.
-Thank you, Quan! -What are you doing?
So graceless.
Why are you so happy when he scolded your wife?
Who's happy? I'm so sad.
So, so, so sad.

How much does this cost, Nam?
That scooter is brand new, and it's expensive. You can't afford it.
-How about this one? -You can't ride it.
-Why not? -It's broken. How will you ride it?
Why do you keep a broken one here?
I'll take this one.
I'm surprised you knew what to choose.
I just pick what I am used to.
Now you have a scooter, focus on working please.
I will introduce you to some transport brokers
so you can work to cover Bunny's expenses.
Hey, Skinny Tu.
-Yes, I'm here. -Are the farmers ready?
Get them on set. We're out of time.
Okay, I got it! We are ready.
Giau, Giau!
Come here. Help me hold the baby.
Yes, Mom.
Hey, why haven't you come inside? Why are you standing out here?
The door is locked
Oh, I forgot.
My wife and Giau are on the film set today.
So the kids and Bunny are out there, aren't they?
No, they are at school. Bunny might be on the filming set.
When a film crew comes here,
my skinny wife will call everyone in this village
to perform as extras.
So why did she bring Bunny with her?
Stop that wagon!
-What's happen? -Honey!
Giau and Bunny are on that wagon. The horse is running away.
-Oh gosh. -Move quickly.
Chase the horse. Quick.
Hurry up.
What? I haven't said "Action!"
Hurry, hurry.
Giau. Bunny.
-Step aside. Move. -Move.
Out of the way.
Hurry up, Tam!
Quick!
Stay out of the way. Quickly.
Hurry!
Faster!
Come here. Come over here.
-Be careful, Quan. -Hurry.
-Be careful, Quan. -Slower!
Okay, okay.
How's it going?
Where are the kids?
-Where is Bunny? -She is here…
-No, she's not. -What?
Mom, Mom.
What are you doing, Giau?
I was taking a pee.
Gosh.
How could I give the baby to you?
Sorry, Quan.
What's wrong with the horse?
I don't know.
I don't know how to explain it to the acting director.
Mr.… Mr. Tuan. I am sorry, Mr. Tuan.
Why? Why hasn't the camera started?
-But… -What?
He has modern style, sir.
-We are filming a historical movie… -His acting skills were phenomenal!
But… but… we are filming a historical movie.
Ouch!
I can zoom in. I will zoom in on his closeup shots.
Why? Why didn't you turn the camera on?
Shut up!
Go over there. Find him for me.
I want him to be a stuntman for the movie.
He must be here tomorrow and shoot this scene for me.
-What do you want? -But… but…
-Please accept this. -Sure, sure.
-Quan, Quan. -I have a great deal for you.
Hey, Quan.
We were lucky that Giau knew how to look after a baby.
Who knows what could have happened?
-I… -You are just so careless as usual.
I apologized to you. I didn't want it to happen either.
Oh my God.
Oh bro.
I can't believe that you have stayed in her house
and yell at her as if you were her mom.
Right.
This look, this face.
Bro, I swear there is no other actor in Vietnam that looks like you.
Tomorrow… can you spare your time helping me with one more scene?
No acting at all.
-Quan, Quan, Quan. -Quan.
Gosh, he asked you to act in a movie.
He didn't ask you to rob somebody. Why are you like that?
-This comes with money. -I don't need money.
Gosh, you are dirt poor. Drop the act.
You don't need money, but Bunny needs food to survive.
Only one scene can provide you
the same as a whole month driving that scooter.
That's right. Opportunities don't knock twice.
Stop!
How much?
Here you go.
What? That much?
Easy job, man.
One million for half an hour.
-Really? One million for half an hour? -Yes.
So how about Bunny?
Skinny Tu can take care of her.
No, no, no. I can't.
Don't mention Skinny Tu. She will cry, see?
She is startled when hearing about Skinny Tu.
I also have this pretty good lady. She had four children.
She just got a divorce.
Stylist!
-I'm here! I'm coming, I'm coming. -Hurry.
-What? What? -Help me look after the baby,
so he can shoot for the scene. That's it.
I'm in charge of costumes, not a maid for this film crew.
They should have known better. Why do I have to do everything?
Oh sweet little baby. I'm here, I'm here.
I'm holding you. Oh yes, love you, love you.
I love babies, Mr. Tuan.
Yes, sir.
-Let's hang out. -Is that okay?
Absolutely. Super professional.
Hello, I am the film director.
You look very cinematic.

What's that?
Who are you after, guys?

That actor.
How many times?
How can we fail in such a simple scene?
What happened?
You hired the guy yesterday.
-Who allowed you to hire him? -I don't…
I didn't approve it, so who asked you to hire him?
You told me to hire him yesterday
Oh?
So that was him?
Yes, it was him.
So there is still one more chance.
Listen carefully.
Go over there. Teach him the right way.
Tell him to act exactly the way he did yesterday.
Got it?
Otherwise,
you won't get paid for this movie.
You hear me? Got it?
I am not a pro. Why do they force me to do it over and over again?
Gosh, it's one million. It's not small money, right?
I was told that this job took 30 minutes.
Why did they ask me to do so much?
Not only that. That guy scolded me.
Quan!
Run!
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey!
Bunny! Bunny!
Wonderful! Exceptional!
Sir… that was a great shot.
Why? Why?
Why did you joke around with a child's life?
I'm sorry, but…
I just wanted the scene to look real.
I'm not insane to play with a child's life.
You see? This is a doll.
Hey, please, calm down.

I like it, because it smells so good.
Smells good? Let's sleep.
Don't complain later if I ever wear your clothes.

Nobody did it for me, Dad.
How could you say so?
You are not a baby anymore. How can't you brush your teeth?
One. Two. Three.
Go brush your teeth.
You are a big girl now. Brush your teeth by yourself.
Yes, that's right. Take your toothbrush.
That's soap. Gosh.
Why did you light the candles?
You know,
it's dark here.
Right.
I lit the candles to find the way into your heart.
Oh, you grow on me.
How can a woman resist you?
Hey, that's the candle for ceremonial offerings.
Where are the incense sticks?
Why do we need them?
For ceremonial offerings.
You are so funny.
I bought this candle to support your mom's business.
I know your family sells joss papers,
so I bought ceremonial candles.
How could you even know that?
You cooked all my favorite dishes.
But we shouldn't eat dinner.
We should taste each other.
Oh honey, I am melting.
Is this your bed?
Dad!
What?
Oh my goodness.
What is this?
Why didn't you tell me you have a kid?
You even have such a haggard wife.
She is not my wife. She is my friend's wife.
Oh my God, you can't even spare your friend's wife.
Hey, I'm not that kind of woman.
I only look after his daughter.
You are pretty, but your mouth isn't.
Hey, so what?
How dare you. How dare you lie to me.
From now on,
don't expect my shop will sell you joss papers

No, she won't accept that.
Take it.
-Five thousand, right? -Right.
She is little but very stubborn.
I don't like you flirting with ladies.
Hey, little oldie, be less obnoxious.
I have to keep you for my mom.
What? Who asked you to?
Dad, you have been tying
my hair the whole day already.
Done!
Which role are you taking in this movie?
That will be a pretty impressive one.
This scene is simple.
You just need to stand on the bridge, nurture your thoughts,
feel the Eastern breezes.
Then you jump in the river.
After that, you get three million.
You talk about it like it's a piece of cake.
And this look.
You have a passionate look for art.
You crave for devotion. You crave for jumping.
Geeze, stop! Cut it out, man!
It's the same line
that you spoke when you were just an assistant
and forced me to jump on that horse carriage.
Now you are a deputy film director,
and you use the same line to convince me to jump off the bridge.
Then when you become a director, am I going to jump off the building?
Dad, are you afraid of heights?
Dad, look at me to ease your fears!
I will get even more scared looking at you.
Dad, you are Superman! Show me your power!
Dad, you are number one! Get going!
Superman flies up to the sky, but they told me to jump off the bridge.
-Bro… -Dad, do it!
Okay, okay, I will jump.
-Can I have 30 seconds to calm down? -Yeah!
Sounding team, lighting team, get in place. Camera, set!
"Young girl jumps off the bridge" scene.
Dad, you can do it!
Actor, standby!
Sir, action!
Action!
You got this! You got this!
You got this! You got this!
Dad, Dad, look at me!
Bunny!
-Cut! Wonderful! -Yes!
Bring her a towel.
Quick, quick.
Oh gosh, wipe her off.
Bro, bro.
Why? Why did you use Bunny to get me? Why?
No, I didn't. She told me to.
Who told you to do that?
Bunny told me to do so.
What?
Can I have 30 seconds to calm down?
Okay, I will jump.
-Is that funny? Are you laughing? -Yes, of course.
Gosh, you even talk back to me like that?
I have to punish you at least once!
I will spank you. Stay out of my way.
I'm teaching my kid.
Never again, okay?
There you go! Your exact look just then.
The fatherly love is just so artistic.
It reminds me of my dad!
Hey.
What? What?
Get in there, give me the money.
Okay. Wipe off! Wipe off!
Producer, payment, producer!
For you, Dad.
Oh my God.
Why did you buy that much shrimp?
You got your paycheck today, Dad! It's three million!
Are you eating till it runs out?
You should save my money.
You are an adult. You can have three shrimps.
I am little. I should have six.
That would be enough for me.
-Hey. What? -Yes, Dad?
Don't ever jump off the bridge again, okay?
How come a girl like you jumps off bridges?
You were too worried then, Dad.
Roi and I jumped from there often.
-Roi and you? -Right.
Oh damn, that boy Roi?
It's him again.
I won't let you visit Sneaky Tam again.
Hey? How did you know I'm visiting?
We were just talking about you, and now you're here.
Hey, come on in.
-Let's have some fruit. -Yes.
How was it? Have you fully recovered, bro?
Forget about my health.
Sit there. I need to discuss some issues between us.
Roi, come over here.
-Yes, sir. -Come over here. Sit down.
Listen up.
-Listen. -Yes, Uncle.
You are not allowed to ask Bunny to jump off the bridge.
You hear me?
What did you do?
Bunny is a girl.
What did you think? Why did you get her do dangerous things?
No, it's not that, Dad.
It's not that, Uncle Quan.
Bunny told me to do it.
I wouldn't dare to do that. Bunny kicked me off the bridge
I did it. I'll go make myself some instant ramen.
You, girl.
How strong!
Go inside and get us some fruit, boy.
Yes, Uncle.
What a way of teaching your kid.
Well, she's a girl.
Wake up. Time to go to school.
Don't want to wake up?
Time for school, darling.
One thing I have learned over the last eight years
is that I can never prepare perfectly
for every situation that comes with raising a child.
Your dad must be home.
-Continue your homework, dear! -Okay.
-Good evening, teacher! -You are home.
Here, I have some gifts for you. This is your favorite cake.
Thank you so much.
Dad, where is mine?
How can I forget you?
Yeah, you shouldn't.
So lovely.
Thank you so much.
Don't act like strangers.
You told me Bunny was sick,
so I came over to help her with the lessons.
I finished teaching her a while ago,
but I wanted to hang around waiting for you.
If you came home a little later, I would have needed to sleep over.
I couldn't let Bunny stay home by herself.
Whenever he goes out selling stuff, I always sleep at home alone.
Don't worry about me.
Oh yes, Bunny is really brave. It's a piece of cake for her.
The neighbors also keep an eye on her for me.
-Don't worry. -I will go home now.
-Okay, take care. -Okay.
You have such a nice bag, teacher.
You can have it.
Why do you give it away when I just compliment it?
Whatever you find beautiful, I will give to you.
-I'm going home. -Okay. Goodbye.
Dad, does this look tasty?
Very tasty.
Dad!
Dad!
-What? -Dad,
does my mom look like Ms. Thao Mai?
Nope. Your mom can't even compare.
Your mom is way more beautiful than Ms. Thao Mai.
Why hasn't she visited me?
She is doing her duty rescuing the world.
Hey, Bunny.
Your mom stays in a very faraway land,
rescuing little kids fighting against T-Rex
as well as devious spiders and other mystical creatures.
Your mom is a wonder woman with a super, super beautiful face.
And especially, her voice is…
soft, gentle, and very attractive.
Quan, she is our baby.
Help me take care of her please.
I am sorry.
Dad, why are you quiet all of a sudden?
My blood pressure is getting higher.
What do you mean?
I miss your mom.
So I am getting high blood too!
What? Why?
Because I miss her too.
That's too much, lady.
You act as if you were an adult getting high blood pressure.
But I don't know how her face is now.
-Whose face? -My mom's, Dad.
You have the photo that I gave you.
I mean I don't know how she looks now.
That photo was taken a long time ago.
You still had a lot of hair at that time.
Now you don't have any.
So my mom will be like you, won't she?
I wish her that.
I'm joking, kid!
Your mom's hair is like a stream.
A DA PHUOC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Hey, guess what? My mom is Wonder Woman!
My mom flies around the world to save the Earth.
There is no Wonder Woman in real life. You are lying!
I told you the truth.
-Dad -What?
Does Mom fly with that?
Oh, right. That's paragliding.
Why do you ask?
My classmates told me that my mom can't be Wonder Woman and that I lied.
Wonder Woman is only on TV.
She exists in reality, so she could fly into the TV.
But my friends said I didn't have a mom and that I lied about that.
Who said that nonsense to you?
How can you exist without a mom?
That's ridiculous.
Why did you believe your friends when I told you the truth?
Bunny, you got a letter from Wonder Woman Mom.
Ask your dad what his favorite dish is.
I will make it for him. Love you.
Why are you walking back and forth?
Dad, why is this letter similar to previous ones?
Well… so…
You know, whenever she writes to me, she only asks about you.
-Ms. Thao Mai. -Yes.
If you care about us, please help us.
Whenever you write letters to Bunny, please get more creative.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I haven't had a child with you, so how can I be more creative?
I have never had a child with anyone, so how can I be more creative?
And she is way too deluded about her mom's power.
You probably should find a way to explain things to her.
How, teacher?
Just tell her the truth.
Does she deserve being hurt?
No, she doesn't.
Talking like that will hurt her.
It's sinful for us to hurt a child's feelings.
It means I won't be able to marry her dad.
No… If somebody does that, they can't have her father's affection.
I am so embarrassed in front of you.
I think like this:
let the kids live their own fairy tales.
When she grows up, she will recognize the nonsense in fairy tales.
That's lovely.
What should I do?
My Bunny has become too smart.
We have to find a way.
School has just started. I need to go to my class.
See you later.
-Goodbye, teacher. -Bye, sir.
You should go.
What are you doing?
Oops, I mistook it.
I thought the school gate was my house's door.
Goodbye.
Hey, hey, hey, take a look!
Wonder Woman Mom.
Dad, can I talk to Mom?
So, do you believe in your Wonder Woman mom?
Yes, Dad.
-Can I talk to Mom? -Here, let me call her. Let me see.
Hey, Wonder Woman Mom, Bunny wants to talk to you.
Mom, what are you doing?
Well,
I am flying in the sky to save all the children in the world.
Mom, can you save them quickly then teach me how to fly?
I will teach you paragliding, ok?
Mom, when will you be back?
I will return home on your birthday, okay?
Hey, you should not…
Yay, Mom is coming home for my birthday!
So you will come home before her birthday, right? Right?
Oh no, I spoke a wrong line.
I was carried away by Bunny.
Dad, Mom sounds like Ms. Thao Mai, doesn't she?
Quan, honey, who is Thao Mai?
Hey, I'll call you back later.
Probably your mom is flying close to Ms. Thao Mai's house,
so she somehow sounds like her.
But your Wonder Woman mom is real, right? You see?
Yes, Dad. Mom said she would visit me on my birthday.
She will be back for my birthday!
I will take her to my school.
Nobody will accuse me of telling lies anymore.
So are you really looking for somebody to cast Bunny's mom?
You're talking nonsense, man!
I can tell Bunny directly that her mom left her,
let her know how terrible her mom is,
let her know that she only needs you in her life.
It is easy for you to say.
You are not in my shoes. How do you know what to do?
If you don't want to help, I'll find someone else.
Oh yeah, go find others to help you. Let's see who else will do that.
Did I owe him in my previous life?
One.
Two.
Three.
-Four. Five. -Stop, stop!
Are you gonna count until I pass out?
Is that what you want?
No, not that, Dad.
-I am counting down to my birthday, Dad. -What for?
So I can see Mom, Dad.
See? I told you.
The problem of lying is that you have to continue lying over and over again.
Because when you stop, people won't believe you anymore,
and you are afraid of hurting them,
especially when that one is your own little daughter.
Dad!
My dear little Bunny, my dearest daughter,
I miss you so much.
However, I am busy helping younger poor kids around the world.
I promise I will visit you as soon as I can.
Love you.
Dad, what does it mean?
So will mom be able to return home for my birthday?
So the thing is…
We shouldn't take it seriously whether Mom comes home or not.
Let's think about the task Mom assigned to you.
She told you to fold paper stars.
Then you can go with her to orphanages and give them to other unlucky friends.
-Okay, Dad. -Okay, then let's work on that project.
Hey, how much is this?
Hello?
Why are you staring at me?
Sorry. I just mistook you for someone else.
-How much is it? -Twenty thousand.
Thank you so much.
Let's go, sweetie.
Hello?
Dad, is this beautiful?
Yeah.
I didn't even ask Linh how she got my phone number
or why she called me.
All I want now is that Bunny can see her mom.
Bunny! Bunny!
Quan.
Bunny!
That's your mom.
No, she can't be.
You told me that my mom is Wonder Woman.
You lied to me.
It's time to tell my daughter the truth.
Bunny.
But I decided… to continue lying to her.
One.
Two.
Three.
Wonder Woman appears!
This time, I convinced Linh to go along with my lies.
I personally see no problem
if that lie brings happiness to my daughter,
which then brings happiness to me.
And that lie helps them see each other again.
Why wouldn't I lie?
Great! Fantastic!
Happy birthday to you.
Thank you, Mom.
This is all Bunny wants to do when she is with her mom.
You were wrong to put me in that situation.
I don't want to lie to my daughter.
Do you think that lie is necessary?
Should I be honest about how her mother treated her?
I'm sorry.
Never mind!
It's just the past!
Actually, I have been struggling for the last eight years
to reach the current stable life.
Recently, I've discussed with Phat about my daughter.
Who is Phat?
How does he relate to Bunny?
He is my boyfriend.
He helped me a lot.
You know, the overseas life is pretty good.
The living standard and education in Singapore is good.
If Bunny has a chance to study there, things would be great for her.
So we intend to come back and bring her with us.
Then you should ask her!
If she agrees, I will let her go.
-Bunny, darling. -Yes, Mom?
Do you want to go with me?
Hey there, what happened? Why do you look so sad?
It was a fun night. You should be happy after coming home.
You went out happy. You should come home happy.
Dad, you won't follow me wherever Mom wants to take me?
You should go and live with your mom.
She misses you when she is alone.
I don't know who that Uncle Phat is, so I don't want to live with him.
Uncle Phat is your mom's friend.
Uncle Phat loves children.
And…. He knows how to paraglide too.
If you go there, he will teach you how to paraglide.
Let me see.
Hmm… is he like you? Probably not.
My dad is number one!
Hey, kid.
How come this feels like a Parents Conference?
Start eating, Bunny!
Just eat, sweetie!
Dad, you should eat too.
She really is her dad's daughter.
Like father, like daughter.
Interesting.
That's right, Uncle. My dad is number one!
If you see my dad flying from the bridge so cool like Superman,
you will be shocked.
This kid.
Why hasn't your mom told me about that?
Maybe she thinks you could be embarrassed
because you are nothing compared to my dad.
This kid.
-Are you sure? -I'm sure.
-Do you wanna bet? -What bet?
When my dad and you both jump off from here,
let's see who is better.
My dear, I will die.
Eat, sweetie.
Hurry up, hurry up! Gosh, it hurts like hell. Quickly please!
Oh my God!
Bro!
Help me please. This is my first movie.
It's very important to me.
Everyone is eating, so how could I help? Really.
Your eyes, your lips, they ignite my fire for art.
Only you. There is no one else like you in Vietnam, bro.
Hey, stop! You act like I am a professional actor.
I am an amateur. I don't have such skills.
-You are wrong, bro. -You see?
Even the film director is amazed by my dad
and has to beg him to join his movie.
It can't be.
I don't believe that.
Dad, Dad.
Uncle Phat doesn't believe you are an actor.
Okay, deal!
Stop there!
Hurry up buddy. Jump!
You got this!
You got this, Dad!
You can do it, Daddy!
You got this, Dad!
-That's fantastic, Dad. Amazing! -Good job! Oh, my bro!
Your dad is Superman.
That's wonderful!
Bro, wake up and clean up the setting.
Hey, bro.
Toothless. Medical team, Toothless.
It's okay, Uncle. Let me wake him up.
Let me.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six. Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Dad, wake up, Dad.
Dad, open your eyes.
Help! Emergency!
-Dad, please open your eyes. -Come over here! Hurry up!
Uncle, something's wrong with my dad.
-Call the ambulance! -Dad, wake up! Open your eyes!
-Bunny. Bunny. It's okay. -Dad!
Dad, wake up, Dad!
Yeah! Yeah!
Dad, are you back?
I know that you are a Superman. You won't die easily. Right, Mom?
Why do you always make the story that I am Wonder Woman
and you are Superman saving the world?
Now she is entitled.
I don't want her to be like that.
Mom.
Can we talk about it another time?
It's good if she knows that sooner.
I am almost done preparing the documents.
I will take her with me sooner.
Why do you have to rush?
You are rich now.
You can visit her here as many times as you want.
Now if you bring her with you, when can I save enough to go visit her?
You can think of it as motivation for you to earn more money and visit her.
You admitted yourself that you can't sponsor her.
Will it be better if she follows me?
In the worst case, I can bring her back to visit you every year.
How many times?
How many years?
Then I will lose my daughter forever, right?
Are you kidding me?
If you were me and somebody gave you a child,
and you raised her since she was a baby
for eight years,
then one day, that asshole comes back and takes her away from you
and stands in front of you talking like a bitch,
what would you do?
Would you wanna kill that asshole?
Linh.
No need to explain to him.
Our lawyer will take care of it.
I'm done.
Teacher, so Bunny…
She can go to school now.
Oh dear, that's really good news.
We never thought that she could have a chance to go to school.
Neither of us have any official documents.
Hey, I'm listening.
Bunny is in trouble for hitting her friend.
Please come over here quickly, Mr. Quan.
We promise we won't tease Bunny anymore.
-Why did you hit them? -Mr. Quan.
Don't you hear me? Why did you hit your friends?
I'm sorry, Dad. They teased me.
They told me that mom is not Wonder Woman.
So is your mom Wonder Woman?
No, she is not.
So was what they said right or wrong?
They were right, Dad.
Once more, I won't let you stay with me, Bunny.
But they said you were not my real father,
so now Mom is taking me away from you.
I don't want to go anywhere. I don't want to!
Bunny!
Bunny!
Four. Five. Six. Seven.
Bunny, baby!
Bunny, darling!
Bunny, darling!
Dad!
Dad, I am so sorry.
It's my fault, honey.
I'm sorry. I was wrong, Dad.
Why can't I have both Mom and you, Dad?
Why is that when I have Mom, I won't have you, Dad?
I want you both.
Darling, I love you.
You will understand when you grow up, sweetie.
I want both of you.
Dad! Look!
Yes.
Let's go to the beach.
We are going to the beach. Join us, Linh.
You have to wear your life jacket. Do you know why?
Because we will land on the water later.
We need a life jacket to stay afloat.
Yes.
Perfect.
Mom!
She wishes to fly in the sky one time with you.
You are here now, so…
Wow!
So beautiful, Mom.
Do you like it?
Yes, I do.
That's Dad.
Bunny!
Bunny!
Bunny?
Bunny!
Bunny!
What is going on, darling?
Bunny!
Bunny!
Help!
Quan!
She passed out!
Bunny.
Quan!
What happened to her?
Patient's guardians, please follow me.
Her acute lymphoblastic leukemia is at the terminally ill stage.
I have to let you know, so you can prepare.
Her blood type is rare, so I need you two to do blood tests.
If she needs it, you can help her.
No, we don't need to run through the blood tests, doctor.
I am her father. She is her mother.
If she needs blood, take mine.
I will give her all my blood. I will give her all, Doctor.
Please calm down, sir. I know what is best for your child.
You two, please follow me!
You have to calm down. You have to. Our daughter needs us right now.
Calm down, Linh.
She is not your daughter.
I'm so sorry.
A girl?
I just found out about her.
DNA TEST
Mom.
I'm here, baby.
Where is my dad?
He just went home to get your stuff.
Take a rest, baby.
When you wake up, you will see him.
Okay, Mom.
I accept your offer. Please take her with you.
My financial condition is almost impossible to help her.
I had a little fund to get our house back.
I will give all that money to you.
Please help save my daughter.
Bunny won't need to go.
Why?
You said that you would come back here to take my daughter with us.
Yes, I did.
Yet, if only she was a healthy child.
But she has a terminally ill disease, and she is going to die.
What have I said wrong?
I just spoke the truth.
Bunny won't have much time.
And her only wish is that she could stay with Quan.
Why don't we let them be happy together?
Take your time. Think about it carefully.
I realize that my biggest fear is also Bunny's fear.
And my biggest fear has come to pass.
Why can't I have you when I have Mom?
Why can't I have Mom when I have you?
I want to be with you both.
My fear is that I can't be with my beloved people.
I just need Mom to come back with us both.
I have been busy cooking for Bunny the whole morning, don't you see?
You cooked too much. How could she eat all this?
-Let me and my brothers share with her. -Gosh.
Uncle Quan, Uncle Quan.
Giau also came back?
Yes, Uncle. Bunny is sick. I have to visit her.
Uncle Quan, where is Bunny?
She is in her room.
Go, go, go.
Hey, boys.
Be quiet, boys.
Hello, ma'am. Are you fine?
What's going on? Do we still have any chance to save her?
No.
Grab all her stuff and move her to another hospital.
We are out of solutions.
Even if so, we still have to find other ways.
We can't just do nothing and watch her die.
Go inside with her.
My cute baby.
No.
What are you doing?
Bunny doesn't know anything yet.
Don't even think of making her cry!
Calm down!
Bunny, look who is here!
Bunny, it's Sneaky Papa Tam here.
Oh look at my little cutie. Are you better yet?
-Feeling better? -Yes, Uncle.
Get her some oranges, boy.
-Why are you standing there? -Peel some oranges.
Don't throw stuff around.
Let's go play with me.
Don't tease her, okay?
And at that moment,
Linh and I made a promise
that our child wouldn't need to choose between her mom and dad…
and that we would use Bunny's remaining time
to give her a lifetime of memories.
We will protect the one thing that every parent must do for their children.
Bunny.
That is our child's happiness.
And my father was right. And Phat was not wrong.
In our lives, we have to confront our fears.
We have to accept that miracles don't always occur.
Oh, oh, oh.
I don't dare to open my eyes.
Try, Dad. Try to open your eyes.
Wow.
Wow.
Mom.
Oh, that's Mom. That's Mom.
Dad, play hide and seek with me, Dad.
Come over and play hide and seek. Hurry up!
I will play with you.
Okay, now what are the rules?
Dad, you will be the seeker. I will go hide, okay?
Hey? Wait a minute.
Why do I have to be the seeker?
If not you, then who else? Come on, let's play.
Hurry, run.
Mom, come play hide and seek with us.
-But I'm… -Play with me.
-Come play with her. -One, two…
-Let me take care of the things here. -Go.
Five.
-Nine. Ten. -Why are you hiding there?
Dad!
What's that?
We are playing hide and seek. You just show me where he is.
Now you got caught.
He saw you right away. You should hide under the table.
Why did you catch me?
Why didn't you catch him? Why did you steal my spot?
Is there somebody here?
Hey.
We are brothers, Sang. Why?
Come over here, come over here. I got you!
Come help Mom.
Stand up, boy! You are taller than that bucket.
How can you hide in there?
Stand up. You got caught. Go over there and stand still.
We are doing the BBQ. Why are you guys playing over here?
Why are you acting out like this?
Over there is you, your wife, and Giau. It's so small, so how can I stay there?
If you want to play, be quick.
-Why? -Let me join!
Gosh, you want to play so bad. You can't lie to us.
Let's catch Bunny, then we can start over again.
So if we catch Bunny, I can play with everyone, right?
Okay, fine.
She is hiding over there. Don't tell her that I told you.
Old man, you have always been sneaky.
Now I will find Bunny and her mom
Bunny, Bunny. Are you all right?
Your dad has just come. Go hide somewhere else.
Hurry up! Go to that side.
I got caught! How could you catch me? Fantastic.
I caught your mom.
Now Bunny, you need to hide very well.
I can't find her. How come? So strange!
Oh dear, how could she fall asleep while playing like this?
Wake up, darling.
Bunny is sleeping.
Bunny.
Bunny, darling.
Wake up. Let's go home, baby.
Darling, please don't play like that. I don't like it.
I would be upset with you, darling.
Hey, darling.
I will count to ten. If you don't wake up,
I will be upset with you.
Hey, I'm gonna start counting now.
One.
Two.
Bunny, can you hear me counting? I am counting to two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Bunny, I'm scared.
Come back to me, darling.
Six.
Seven.
Bunny.
Eight.
Nine.
Bunny!
Bunny!
My darling!
My darling!
Bunny, darling, Bunny!
Bunny!
Wake up darling, please. Bunny! Bunny! Bunny!
Bunny!
Bunny, darling, Bunny!
Wake up, darling! Please, Bunny!
Bunny!
Dad.
Dad.
What?
Everyone is waiting for you, Dad.
Dad, do it!
Quan!
You got this! Don't let me down!
Bro, this is your first leading role.
Let's count together.
Sure, Dad.
One.
Your eyes.
It's the same color as your eyes.
The way I felt when I saw this…
This feeling…
What is it called?
"Major Gilbert.
I've been in the hospital for 120 days now.
My strength has almost recovered.
Movement is still a little difficult
but I can perform my duties.
Please let me return to my post soon."
KINGDOM OF ENCIEL SOMEWHERE IN THE CAPITAL OF ENCHAINE
Her existence was hidden from everyone.
However, people who knew about her
said that she was a weapon.
She would fight if you ordered her to.
She just looked like a human.
She was just a tool…
without a heart.
Lt. Colonel Hodgins.
Come this way.
Sorry.
Violet!
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
Where is the major?
Where's Major Gilbert?
He's not here.
Where is he?
Did he return home?
How are his injuries?
His injuries were severe.
Is the major…
alive?
He's…
They've given us permission to discharge you from the hospital.
Lt. Colonel Hodgins came all this way to pick you up.
Uh, that's right.
Excuse me. Lt. Colonel Hodgins.
Violet. Relax.
I'd forgotten you were a Lt. Colonel.
-I apologize. -It's okay.
Sit down.
Anyways. So, you do remember me?
We've met twice. Once during training and the night before the battle.
Yeah. You're right.
What were you doing?
I was writing a report to Major Gilbert.
They said that writing words would be good for my recovery.
Is the major well?
Don't worry, Violet.
He asked me to come here.
So, that means he's fine.
The doctor told me that we won the war.
What post is he assigned to now?
When shall I join him?
Get changed first.
I'll have them send the car in the meantime.
These finally arrived. They're your belongings.
Looks like they mistakenly delivered it to an army base far away.
The brooch.
The emerald brooch.
This is everything from the garrison and the place where they found you.
I have to go look for it if it's not here.
Violet!
It was a gift.
The major gave it to me!
I understand.
I'll look for it.
I promise.
-But-- -You must
come with me.
These are his orders.
Orders?
I understand.
When will I receive the next order from the major?
I'm limited to only performing certain duties because of my current condition.
Violet. Congratulations on getting discharged.
I didn't know what you'd like, so, I bought three. What do you think?
I don't need them.
No. You have to choose one.
Pretend that the world is about to end. Okay. Three, two…
Then… the puppy.
Here.
Why did you choose the puppy?
The major's brother once told me,
"You're Gilbert's dog."
It's going to be a bit of a long journey.
The train tracks around here were damaged during the bombing and aren't usable anymore.
were damaged during the bombing and aren't usable anymore.
Have you ever been to Leiden before?
No.
Gilbert was thinking about your future after the war.
He said he wanted to leave you with the Evergarden household,
his most trusted relatives.
I contacted them,
I contacted them, and the couple said they'd be happy to take you in.
Welcome.
Let's go, Violet.
This is the lady of the Evergarden household.
Say your greetings.
A bow would suffice.
Doesn't it take around three days from Enchaine now?
Yes. Normally, I'd be able to return in one day.
But the war has been going on for four years.
It's going to take some more time to restore everything.
Violet.
Have some tea.
Oh! Sorry. Don't force yourself.
Oh, no! You'll get burned.
It's not a problem. I can't feel heat.
But your bandages… Quick, we have to cool them down. Oliver, bring some ice!
Quick, we have to cool them down. Oliver, bring some ice!
Yes, madam.
These arms are made of adamant silver.
They're a bit bulky, but they're sturdy.
I'm not accustomed to them yet. I should be able to adjust soon.
Can you come this way for a minute?
I used these when I was young.
Very nice. Try them on.
Yeah. They look good on you.
Really!
Well, I'm going to get going now.
I have to get back to the office.
Oh.
Violet.
Listen to Tiffany, okay?
It's okay.
Don't worry about me.
Think of me as your real mother.
Tell me anything. Okay?
I…
Don't have parents, so, I don't need any replacements.
Don't say that.
I had a son,
but he was killed in the war.
I can't become a replacement for your lost child.
Violet. Gilbert's wish is for you to happily live here.
So,
do you understand?
The major.
The major. Why is he leaving me here?
Is it because I lost my arms, and lost my value as a weapon?
If I just trained a little, I could still fight!
Violet.
The war is over.
I'm the major's tool.
But if he doesn't need me anymore,
then I should be thrown away.
Throw me away.
Throw me away somewhere.
Lt. Colonel Hodgins.
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
I left the army. I'm not a Lt. Colonel anymore
Then what should I call you?
Call me "President."
This is my company.
I bought an old house and renovated it a bit.
The first floor is the reception.
Sir. Please write the receiver's and sender's address on this form.
Please allow three days for delivery.
The second floor houses the office and the writing department.
-Writing? -Yeah.
This department writes letters at the requests of our clients.
There are still many people who don't know how to write.
I didn't know how to write either until the major taught me how.
I see.
I was thinking about starting a business once the war ended.
The government's postal service doesn't address the civilian's needs,
so, I thought it would be a good opportunity.
I have an order for you.
Violet Evergarden.
Gilbert left you with me.
So, I'm giving you orders instead.
You're still useful.
You can work. Here.
Benedict.
What's up, President?
You're supposed to say "How can I help you, President?"
So, what's up?
-What's up with you? -You did that on purpose!
This is Benedict. He's a postman.
He's an old friend from before I started this company.
Benedict, this is Violet.
She's going to work here as a postman, starting today.
She's just a kid.
She's highly capable of performing her duties.
I'm going to go to the bank.
Teach her what she needs to know, got it?
Put your stuff here.
Yes, sir.
Your uniform.
-Change. -Yes, sir.
Sort them just like it says here. Put them in those shelves.
There's a huge pile of mail, but no need to rush.
The break room is on the second floor.
Yes, sir.
Bye.
I've almost completed my duties.
Were you working the whole time? Without taking a break?
I'm used to long hours.
Okay, do you want to try delivering the mail?
Delivering?
You deliver the letter to the address that's written on it.
I'm going home now.
See you tomorrow.
Violet!
What are you doing?
I'm delivering the mail.
Uh, mail delivery was meant for tomorrow.
And make sure to take breaks during work.
-You just got released from the hospital. -It's not a problem.
Yes. It is a problem.
Violet. Go ahead and eat.
I'm going to eat.
I'll take you to the office once you're done.
We only have space in the attic, but you can sleep there.
Uh, the Evergarden household has agreed to take you in
until you become an adult.
But it looks like leaving you at the mansion…
It looks like there was a problem.
-Ouch! -Hey, you! I was trying to put it nicely!
How was I supposed to know?
See you tomorrow.
I'll take you home.
What was the last order you received from Gilbert?
He said "Run away and live freely."
And, I…
You've been in the army ever since you were a child.
You've spent your life fulfilling your duties.
You're going to learn a lot of things.
But it might be easier to keep living
if you didn't learn them, if you didn't know them.
You don't realize that your body is on fire
You don't realize that your body is on fire and burning up because of the things you did.
I'm not burning.
Yes, you are.
I'm not.
-You don't make sense. -No.
You are burning.
I saw you like that, but left you alone.
That's why when Gilbert left you with me,
I thought this was my chance.
You'll understand one day.
And then you'll realize for the first time that you have many burns.
Ms. Doll?
No, I'm Violet.
Uh, Miss Violet.
I want to ask you to write something for me.
Write something?
"You were the first person
who was kind to me.
You were everything to me.
I would have done anything for you."
Go!
"I want to know what you're feeling.
I want to understand what's in your heart.
Even though we're apart now…
I…
love you."
How is that?
Yes.
"I love you."
Please go to reception on the first floor for the delivery process.
Sir.
Thank you for using the Auto Memory Doll Service.
And? Who are you?
How did you know?
Huh?
How did you know that the man just now wanted to say
"I love you"?
You want to work as an Auto Memory Doll?
Yes. It's still hard for me to hold a pen.
But I can operate a typewriter.
No, that's not what I mean.
I wanted to ask why you want to do this work.
I want to know!
"I love you."
I want to know what it means!
The major said those words to me after he gave me my last orders.
That was the first time I heard those words from the major.
I can't understand…
what that means.
Normally,
people become Auto Memory Dolls because they understand that.
But…
It's okay.
She had always just followed Gilbert's orders in the past.
That was the first time she asserted her own will.
Everyone said she didn't have a heart and that she was a tool,
but she said, "I want to know what 'I love you' means."
No way! There's no way I'm going to let you die!
Stop!
Stop already!
Live.
Violet.
Live, and…
be free.
From the bottom of my heart…
I love you.
Hey. Get up.
I found her in the northeastern war zone.
Her name is…
Violet Evergarden.
She's going to start working today as an Auto Memory Doll apprentice.
Please train her on everything.
Okay.
Um, first off…
How much do you know about what Auto Memory Dolls do?
They write letters at the request of others.
Lt. Colonel Hodgins… I mean,
the president told me so.
That's right!
I can't say that I completely understand, but I think I can perform my duties.
It's not that easy! "Duties?" What are you talking about?
Iris, that's enough. Get back to work.
All right.
That reminds me, I haven't introduced the other Dolls to you yet.
-"Doll" refers to-- -I understand it's an abbreviation
for Auto Memory Doll. I figured it out the other day.
That's right.
The girl just now… Her name is Iris.
She's a new hire who just completed her training course.
And that's Erica.
She and I have both been working as Dolls for a while.
This company is still pretty young,
so, we're all like rookies here.
Violet, do you know how to use a typewriter?
I've never used one before.
Then why don't you start off by practicing typing?
It's not that easy to become a Doll.
Iris, can we borrow your manual?
Okay.
Uh, have a seat.
Yes ma'am.
You should remove your gloves.
Okay.
Are you okay?
It's not a problem.
Then why don't you try it out a bit?
Set the paper like this.
Turn the knob and feed it in.
Place your pointer fingers on the F and J keys, and try typing something.
Okay.
That's right. Just like that.
Just memorize where your fingers should go for the different letters.
Try typing what it says in this manual.
Oh, wait. Violet.
Violet! Stop!
Can you type a little more…
quietly?
I'm done!
How is this?
Nice. Violet, stand up.
Yes.
It looks good on you. I was right after all.
Oh, and don't forget this.
Sorry for being late.
Open it.
Opening.
This is it.
This is the brooch the major gave me!
It was on the black market.
Someone must have stolen it from your belongings.
Oh, yeah! Violet,
do you want to attend a Doll training course?
They have short-term courses, too.
Iris attended one, too.
The teacher is really strict.
I think it'll be good for you.
Leiden is such a big city!
I know! I got lost because there's
so many more roads than my town.
They say it's easier to find a job if you have a brooch from here.
I just want to graduate and go home.
I bet you just want the brooch.
You got me.
Quiet.
All of you, welcome to the Auto Memory Dolls' Training School.
I'm very sorry.
You'll be considered absent on your second tardy.
Yes, ma'am.
Now that the war is over,
the demand for Dolls has never been higher.
Of course, it is possible to become a Doll
without attending our school.
But our objective is not to train just any Doll.
It is to train you to become the best Doll you can be.
Graduating from our school is proof of excellence.
However, if I do not deem you a worthy Doll,
you will never be given this certification.
Do you understand?
Affirmative.
An optimal Doll
must be able to type as fast as someone speaks.
Now, begin.
What is the matter, Ms. Evergarden?
You did not specify a speed.
I see.
Then you can type if it's specified?
In that case, type 200 characters per minute.
Affirmative.
-I shall begin. -Very well.
The letter-writing skills an optimal Doll must have include
knowledge of grammar, vocabulary,
and several forms and styles for letters.
Time is up.
Now, I shall announce your evaluations for today.
Grammar results.
Grammar results. Perfect score. Violet Evergarden.
Next, vocabulary results. Another perfect score.
Violet Evergarden.
Today's class will be
actual training for writing on behalf of someone.
-Are you ready? -Let us do our best, Ms. Luculia.
So, who do you want to address it to?
Someone I'd like to write a letter to?
Just choose someone close to you,
who you'd like to express your feelings to.
Someone close?
Please address it to Mr. Claudia Hodgins.
Claudia? Is that a friend? Family?
He's my boss.
That is all. This concludes my report.
Violet Evergarden.
Oh, you're done?
Then…
"Have you received any new orders from the major?"
Please add that at the end.
It sounds more like a report than a letter.
Now it is your turn, Ms. Luculia.
Right. Let's see. My bro…
No. I'll address it to my parents.
Copy that.
I haven't been able to really thank my mother and father for everything yet.
It's hard to express what you want to say
when it's time to actually write the letter.
Oh, and all the places we've been to together,
and the places we wanted to go.
There's just so many to list.
"See you soon. You don't need to worry about me.
Sincerely, Luculia."
Violet, read this for me.
Yes, ma'am.
"Dear Father and Mother,
it has been a while but I have nothing specific to report."
I worry that I have not expressed my gratitude
I worry that I have not expressed my gratitude for our previous engagements.
Regarding the places we have been and desire to go,
I have nothing to report.
I am currently working very diligently.
I am currently healthy and safe.
There have been no issues.
That is all. Please do not be concerned. Luculia."
And do you believe that is a letter?
It could be that I was too abstract.
That is not the issue.
Letters are about communicating someone's feelings.
An optimal Doll will be able to decipher the person's true feelings
and express it on paper.
Violet,
your grades are excellent and your typing is very fast and accurate.
However, what you have written on her behalf cannot be called a letter.
You cannot call this a letter?
-I could go aga-- -That is all for today.
You just had an off day today.
I have been told the same thing before.
I see.
Let me show you the best view in the city.
Here.
Watch your step.
Beautiful, isn't it?
I've always loved this view since I was a child.
Violet.
I hope that one day
you'll be able to see that beautiful view in Leiden.
Well, I'm going this way.
See you tomorrow.
Ms. Luculia.
Call me Luculia, Violet.
Go on home already.
Come on, don't be like that.
Just one more.
Brother! Were you drinking again?
No!
Go home.
I haven't had a drink because he won't let…
Spencer! Are you okay?
Damn it.
Luculia.
Thank you.
Violet, I'm thankful for the letter,
but it feels more like a report.
My instructor also stated that it could not be called a letter.
Will I…
be able to become an optimal Doll?
Bluebell Junoa.
-Yes. -Iberis Konoue.
Yes.
Luculia Marlborough.
Luculia Marlborough!
Here.
Congratulations to the nine of you for graduating our program.
I hope you all become optimal Dolls.
Yes! Where are you going to work?
I'm going to work in my hometown.
Maybe I'll find something in Leiden.
What about you, Luculia?
Um…
I haven't decided anything yet.
What? But you were the top of our class.
I see. That's too bad.
I am sorry to disappoint you.
It's all right!
Not graduating doesn't mean you can't become a Doll.
Then…
what was the purpose for going to the school?
While it is true that graduating is not everything,
if I'm unable to decipher
the person's true feelings and express it on paper,
then there's no point in becoming a Doll.
I knew you would come here.
Luculia.
Why are you here when the program is over now?
Because I thought I could see you again if I came here.
Tell me, Violet…
Who is the major?
You always ask at the end of your letters if the major had sent a letter yet.
Isn't he the one you really want to send a letter to?
Why don't we write a letter to him today?
Not like your usual reports,
but a letter with your true feelings.
I won't leave until we're done.
Major…
I'm sorry.
I don't even know what I want to say to him.
Because I do not even understand the meaning
of the words he told me.
Violet, why did you want to become a Doll?
I… want to know what "I love you" means.
You want to know what "I love you" means?
It's hard to communicate your feelings, isn't it?
The truth is, my parents died.
The only family I have left
is my brother.
I don't know what to say to him.
When the war began,
my brother got drafted.
But there wasn't much fighting in the Western Front
where he was deployed.
The fighting was always taking place far away.
So, the war didn't feel real to us.
But…
one day, when my parents went to Herne for business…
The Western Front was broken.
They couldn't find any trace of my parents.
And then the war ended.
-My brother came home alive. -Come on, give me one drink at least!
Give it a rest already!
I wanted to be happy that at least he was alive.
What the hell?
-But… -Shut up!
my brother was angry that he wasn't able to protect Herne.
He blames himself
for our parents' deaths.
Don't show your face around here again.
I was just…
I was just…
happy that he was alive.
I just want to tell him "thank you."
But…
I can't.
Luculia,
let's write a letter.
Let's put all your feelings
into a letter.
But whenever I think about telling him,
nothing comes out.
I've tried so many times.
But it's no use.
I'm sure I never will.
Thank you, Violet.
We'll write your letter to the major another time.
An optimal Doll
will be able to decipher
the person's true feelings and express it on paper.
Spencer.
Wait, Spencer.
Come on.
Thanks.
Hurry up. This way.
Wow. It's so beautiful.
You.
You're Luculia's friend.
-What's this? -It is a missio…
No, an assignment.
No, it is a letter.
From Luculia to you.
From Luculia?
"To my brother.
"To my brother. I'm happy…
I'm happy that you are alive.
Thank you."
LUCULIA MARLBOROUGH
Violet!
Luculia.
What is it?
Good morning, Violet.
Instructor. I thought class was over.
Sorry, I'm the one who asked her to come here.
Luculia showed me this letter.
The letter you wrote on behalf of Luculia for her brother.
The feelings I've been wanting to tell my brother.
Violet,
you were able to tell him for me.
An optimal Doll
will be able to decipher
the person's true feelings and express it on paper.
You were able to express a feeling.
Violet.
I hope you become an optimal Doll.
Yesterday's play was so good.
You should have come, Violet.
If you mean Red Devil, I am reading the play now.
I'm so jealous.
I would have loved to scribe for Oscar Webster.
It means you get to read his new work first, doesn't it?
It'll be his first new work in a while when he finishes.
"Ah, I must live with my sin now.
For the rest of my life."
GENETRIX ROSWELL REGION
Who is it?
The Auto Memory Doll service.
What's that?
It is a pleasure to meet you.
I will travel anywhere to meet your request.
Auto Memory Doll
Violet Evergarden at your service.
What a surprise.
I wasn't expecting such a child.
If I am not to your liking,
I can arrange for another Doll.
No, as long as you can type.
My health hasn't been the best.
I am terribly sorry,
but I ask that you refrain from alcohol while we work.
I can't write unless I drink!
I will be the one writing.
Then let's start working tomorrow.
You're being a little difficult.
Sir.
I have cleaned the area for a better writing environment.
I brought my own typewriter.
Do you have any typing paper?
No. They sell it at the store by the port.
Go buy some.
And dinner, too, while you're at it. I want carbonara.
Sir.
I am a scribe, not a maid.
You're being difficult.
I've got all the ingredients you need here.
Thank you very much.
What's wrong? Is there something on it?
No, I was just wondering how I am supposed to cook this.
You crack the egg and separate the yolk.
Yolk?
What are you doing?
I am trying my hand at cooking.
Well, it's pretty good for your first try.
-Are you not having any? -I will have some later.
I see.
Next is Olive's line.
"We must cross this valley of fire
in order to get the sword to slay the monster."
Stage direction. "Enter a water spirit."
The spirit's line.
"I will extinguish this fire for you."
"Then you will be able to cross this valley."
So, they will be able to cross it? Thank goodness.
Stage directions. "The burning fire is extinguished."
How will it be extinguished?
If they pull in the red cloth that is waving around on the stage,
it will look like it's been put out.
I see. Understood.
So, what do you think?
Is it good?
How do I put this?
Yes?
I feel like I'm going through the experience
even though it never really happened.
I find myself feeling much like this girl, Olive.
Feeling happy, and feeling sad.
Feeling uncertain.
Why is that?
That's because you are feeling what the protagonist Olive is feeling.
You feel empathy towards Olive.
I'm relieved that you feel that way.
This is my first time writing a children's play.
Will Olive be able to cross the valley of fire,
find the sword, and slay the monster after this?
Yes, but in the process, she loses her power to speak with the spirits.
Oh, no.
Then how will she return home?
She already lost her boat.
-I haven't come up with that yet. -You must.
You have to,
or she can't return to her father who is waiting for her.
Have you come up with an idea?
The weather is nice today.
No, it's too good.
Sir.
What is this?
Oh, it's just a parasol.
Why do you ask?
It's a really beautiful parasol.
I need…
a little break.
One day…
I promise to show you one day.
Stop!
Please, stop!
I apologize.
-I shouldn't have… -That's enough!
That's enough.
Go home.
Then the play will not be completed.
Olive's story will never be completed.
Sir, is there something you're hiding from me?
I don't have the ability to sense those emotions.
I apologize.
I can't write anything anymore.
But I can't let it end like this.
So, that's why
I thought I would finish the story I told Olivia.
Olivia?
Yes.
My daughter.
I moved here with my daughter after I lost my wife to an illness.
This used to be our summer home.
I think she was sad not having a mother.
But…
But she never showed it.
Rather, she always helped me so I could focus on my work.
My daughter's favorite things were a frilled parasol
and water birds.
I'm so jealous.
I want to try crossing this lake, too.
Do you think I could walk on those leaves?
Maybe if you let the wind carry you with your parasol.
Olivia!
I'm okay.
I'm going to walk across this lake.
I promise to show you one day.
Okay, Dad?
And then…
after arguing with the doctors,
I decided to bring her back here to spend what time she had left.
It was good to see her smile again.
Our days were quiet and warm.
But…
my only hope…
Why does God continue to take away what's most precious to me?
Parting with someone who is important to you…
Never being able to see them again…
I never knew it was so sad…
and painful.
I'm sorry for earlier.
No, you are the one in pain.
I apologize for being the one to lose composure.
I will finish it.
Olive's story.
The girl will reach her home and reunite with her father.
No matter how difficult the adventure, she will get a happy ending.
Both the protagonist and audience will be happy.
I will make it happen.
The monster falls.
Olive. "We finally slayed the monster."
Water spirit. "You did well."
Wind spirit.
"We must return to the spirit realm."
Fire spirit. "This is goodbye."
Olive stands frozen.
Now, how do we get Olive home from here?
Since her boat sank, will she take a plane?
Something a little more imaginative.
She could fly home if she were a bird.
-What about flying with a parasol? -You cannot fly with a parasol.
But you can!
The wind spirit appears before her one last time and says,
"Olive, open your parasol."
Could you try opening the parasol for me?
"That parasol is your wings.
You'll be carried away if you fly too high.
So, step on the ocean's waves, the river's rocks,
and the fallen leaves on the lake."
That's a wonderful idea.
Right? After returning home, Olive reunites with her father.
And the first thing she says when they're reunited after crossing the ocean is…
What should it be?
"I'm home."
No, "Father?"
Do you have writer's block again?
Could you walk towards me from over there? I'd like to visualize it.
I can do that.
Across the fallen leaves on the lake if you can.
Understood.
No, that last bit was just…
I'm so jealous.
I want to try crossing this lake, too.
Do you think I could walk on those leaves?
One day…
I promise to show you one day.
Okay, Dad?
How I wish I could hear you call me that a thousand times more.
I wish…
you didn't have to die.
If only you could have lived… grown up…
How I wished that for you.
Did you see that?
I believe I made three whole steps.
Sir?
What is the matter?
Are you feeling ill?
Are you sure I can have this parasol?
Yes.
-I thought I could fly a little further. -You went far enough.
You were able to fulfill Olivia's "one day" wish.
One day?
Farewell.
Thank you for using our Auto Memory Doll service.
No, thank you.
Violet Evergarden.
You don't realize that your body is on fire and burning up
You don't realize that your body is on fire and burning up because of the things that you did.
-I'm not-- -You are burning.
You'll understand what I said someday.
And then you'll realize for the first time that you have many burns.
Major.
Live.
Am I allowed?
Be free.
I was used as a weapon to kill people. Do I deserve to live?
I've probably taken away so many "one day" wishes.
And those people most likely had loved ones.
I'm not burning.
I am.
I'm not burning.
I am.
The fire is spreading across my body from all the things I've done.
I am on fire.
Oh?
If it isn't you, Violet!
Madam.
Please forgive me for being disrespectful before.
I sincerely apologize for hurting your feelings.
Violet, you don't have to apologize for that. Please stop bowing.
I'm so thankful to see how far you've come.
I am sure Gilbert can rest in peace, too.
Rest in peace?
You said he was alive!
The major is safe, right?
That's…
He's alive, right?
I'm sorry. I just couldn't bring myself to tell you.
After the Final Battle of Intense,
you were found alone on the ground under a church.
Most likely, he pushed you away right before it was bombarded.
While we didn't find his body, we did find his ID tag under the debris.
-And so, he was deemed missing in action. -So, we do not know.
-But given the situation… -I'm sure the major is alive.
-Violet… -He's alive!
Violet, please understand, he's already…
I won't. I don't understand.
I won't. I don't understand. How could I be the only one to survive?
The major was there with me.
And he…
Violet, you have to accept it, even if it's difficult.
Violet!
What's your name?
I see.
Would it be okay if I gave you a name then?
Violet.
Violet.
I have a feeling you'll grow into the name when you're older.
Don't be a tool,
become someone that matches with their name.
Yes?
It's you.
Is the major…
Is the major here?
He's here,
right?
The Young Master is…
Gilbert Bougainvillea.
This is the major's name.
Major.
What's the matter?
Violet?
Major.
Major!
You're alive!
That outfit.
I am currently working as an Auto Memory Doll.
-You are? -Yes.
I scribe letters.
Letters, you say?
With the very hands that took the lives of so many?
Major?
You write letters to connect people?
Major?
Major.
Major!
What…
should I do?
Please.
Please give me an order.
I've got a letter for you, Violet Evergarden.
It's addressed to you.
Erica and Iris asked me to deliver it.
Well, I've done my part.
You are still delivering at this hour?
Yes.
Well, I'm heading down Craft Street.
Could I get you to cover one street back?
After all, each one of them contains someone's precious feelings.
Every letter deserves to be delivered.
Hey, a letter!
Mom! It's from Dad!
Have you finished your deliveries?
Thanks for the help.
That's great! They all made it home.
"How are you doing, Violet?
I thought about coming to see you,
but after talking with Iris, we decided to write you a letter instead.
It might be strange for a Doll to write to another Doll,
but we wanted you to know that we are worried about you.
And that we are also…
waiting for you."
You might not feel like coming back to work right now,
so, take all the time you need.
But if something happens, please don't hesitate to call us.
Both Iris and I have faith that you will return.
Also, someone named Spencer came asking to scribe a letter for him.
He wanted to send a thank you and an apology letter to his younger sister.
He specifically asked for you…
and insisted on having you write the letter.
Is this to your satisfaction?
Yes.
It's a little embarrassing sending a letter to your own little sister,
but I found a new job thanks to her.
She helped me want to start over again.
Sorry for all this. Making you come all the way here.
I heard that you were taking some time off work.
My coworkers informed me of your request…
through a letter.
It was the very first letter I'd ever received.
It helped me realize
just how special it is to receive a letter.
I think Luculia will be very pleased.
Thank you.
A person matching their name.
A name that is suitable. Violet?
It is just as you said.
I had many burns all over my body.
Is it okay?
Do I…
Do I have a right to be an Auto Memory Doll?
Do I…
Do I have a right to live?
You can't erase the past.
But…
But…
But all your Auto Memory Doll accomplishments…
shall never be forgotten either, Violet Evergarden.
What do you want to do today?
I don't know.
Playing house got a little boring.
Yeah.
I wonder when Mommy's visitors are going to leave.
They should go home already.
I know.
What's that?
I saw a doll walking down the path.
A really big doll.
She seemed like bad news for some reason.
Mommy, Mommy!
Miss Ann!
-I see what you're saying, but… -It's important to do.
-Yes, but… -Mommy!
Ann! Don't I always tell you that you have to knock first?
Also, a proper greeting.
Welcome to our home.
-Pardon me, Mother. -My.
Very good.
Now, what is it?
Did you find another strange bug?
-I don't want to see it though, okay? -It's not a bug!
I saw a doll walking over!
A doll?
Madam.
She's arrived.
Oh, that Doll! That was today, wasn't it?
Please show her in.
-Yes, madam. -Wait a second!
I'm very sorry, but we'll have to do this another time.
Wait, what are you going to do with this mansion?
She can't live here on her own. That's why we offered--
Please come back another time.
Wait!
Ann.
Be a good girl, okay?
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
Thank you for coming all this way.
It's not a problem.
She talks!
I will travel anywhere to meet your request.
Auto Memory Doll--
I knew you were a doll!
Ann!
-I'm sorry. -No apology necessary.
Violet Evergarden at your service.
Please, have a seat. Would you like some tea?
I hope it's to your liking.
-Please help yourself. -Thank you.
She's drinking!
-What happens to the tea you drink? -Ann.
It will eventually be expelled from my body and return to earth.
Ann, you're being rude.
Shall we begin?
I understand that I have been hired for a seven-day period.
Yes, I'd like to get started right away.
Understood. Where shall we work?
Well, how about we do it in the sunroom where it's bright?
-What are you going to do? -She's helping me write a letter.
I can write a letter for you!
You don't know how to spell the hard words yet, Ann.
I can do it!
Besides, Ms. Violet is very famous for being a very good letter writer.
Who is the letter to?
Well…
Someone very far away.
-Far away? -Yes.
It's an important letter.
You're not allowed in the sunroom, okay?
Shall we, Miss Violet?
Understood.
This is the typewriter I brought.
That is fine with me.
Understood.
I knew she was bad news.
She really is a doll.
Madam!
Are you okay, Mommy?
I'm okay.
I'll get better in no time.
Really?
Really.
I know! I'll sing you a lullaby!
Thank you.
But grownups don't need lullabies.
Then can I sleep here with you?
Oh.
But I thought you outgrew naps.
I want to take one today.
More importantly, Ann, would you go entertain our visitor?
I hate visitors.
They all try to take you away from me.
I'm sorry, Ann.
But please, it's just for seven days.
Be a good girl for me, okay?
My mother said she'll be resting for a while.
I see.
She's just a little sleepy.
I'll entertain you in the meantime.
I hate visitors,
but you're a doll.
What are we going to do?
Well, we could talk, or play, or something.
That is outside my expertise.
However,
if it is only for a little while…
-Then let's play with my doll! -Very well.
A doll playing with a doll, that's too funny!
What shall I do with this?
Talk to her, or take care of her, obviously!
First, you need to say hello.
Hello!
Hello.
Oh, hello.
The doll was the one who said that!
I see.
I understand.
Oh, right! You're a doll,
so, you've never played with one of your own!
No, I--
I'll teach you how!
Next, let's play house then.
I have a table out in the yard.
Excuse me, your room is ready. I shall show you to it.
Thank you.
You will have to excuse me.
Your room is on the second floor.
I wonder what they're talking about.
Ellis!
-I'll go take that over! -Oh! You certainly may not!
This is my job.
Please don't take it from me.
Why is life so unfair?
"The thief was surprised.
He yelled, 'Ah!'
And ran away."
You are quite good at reading.
Violet!
What kind of bread is really hard and can't be eaten?
You could put it in soup to soften it.
Violet! Violet!
Until my mom comes, let's do riddles and dance together
and play house and catch bugs…
Miss Ann.
Please tell me the order of priority.
What are your thoughts?
-Yes, it's very good. -Then I shall continue in this style.
Thank you.
-Ann! -Oh, it's not what you think!
I was hoping Violet could tie a ribbon in my hair.
I see, but later, okay?
Madam, would you allow me a short break?
Huh?
I believe Miss Ann would like it now.
There you are, Miss Ann.
I didn't want you to put the ribbon in my hair.
-Yes. -I really wanted my mommy to do it.
-Yes. -And she's the one I want to read with…
and do riddles and play house…
Although Mommy doesn't like bugs.
Stop taking away my time with my mommy, Violet!
It's only for a few more days.
Then tell my mommy I can be there when you're writing your letter!
I just want to be near her!
All I want is to be close and squeeze her hand. Please!
I am terribly sorry, I cannot do that.
Why not?
I'm sorry, Miss Ann.
I must be getting back.
-Do you think we could finish by today? -Yes, if we continue at this pace.
Madam, if you would.
Madam?
I'm okay.
Madam!
-I'm okay. -But…
Please, continue.
-Stop! That's enough! Mommy! -Miss Ann!
-That's enough! -Ann.
I'm okay. So, please go play in the other room.
Why are you writing this letter?
Who is it for? Daddy isn't even with us anymore!
-It's an important letter. -It's for someone I don't know, isn't it?
Someone who won't even come visit you!
No one really cares about you anyway!
Is the letter more important than me?
There's nothing more important than you.
You're such a liar.
I'm not lying.
But you're not getting better at all! You said you were going to get better!
That's right.
I already know!
I…
I'll be all alone once you're gone!
How much longer will I be able to be with you?
If I'm going to be all alone anyway,
then stop writing some letter and spend time with me now!
Please, Mom!
Please!
-Mommy! -Miss Ann.
Mommy!
Miss Ann!
Miss Ann.
I want to reassure you
that the time I am spending with your mother is for a good cause.
Please, I ask you not to be angry with your mother.
But… But…
It is only natural that this is painful for you.
You had to accept your mother's illness at such a young age.
You are so strong.
I'm not!
I'm not…
I…
I made my mommy cry!
No.
You are a very kind person.
-I'm not. -You are.
I'm not!
I'm not! I'm not!
-My mommy got sick because I'm a bad girl! -Her illness is unrelated.
It is! It is!
There is nothing… There is nothing that can be done.
You're wrong.
Just as my arms…
can never be soft and warm like yours are.
There is nothing that can be done.
Mommy… Mommy…
Why is she writing a letter?
People have feelings they want to express to others.
Who cares?
They don't need to.
There is no such thing as a letter that doesn't deserve to be delivered, Miss Ann.
Then the day came when the doll who embraced me
finished writing the letters and it was time to say goodbye.
Violet!
-Miss Ann. -Huh?
You're warm.
Wait, are you…
Then what about the tea you drank?
As I said,
I will eventually expel it from my body and it will return to the earth.
She wasn't a doll after all.
And she wasn't bad news either.
She was very kind.
I really wish I could have read the letters she wrote.
I wonder who they were for.
Ann.
Let's have some tea.
Let's play with my doll, Mommy.
-Okay. -Then we can read books and play house…
Ann.
Ann.
My Ann.
Ann.
Ann.
Happy eighth birthday.
There might be many sad things happening,
and you might be feeling really overwhelmed right now.
But don't give up hope.
You might be sad and feel like crying,
but don't forget:
Your mother loves you very much.
Ann,
happy tenth birthday.
I'm sure you've grown quite a lot.
But I'm sure you still love reading and dancing.
Have you graduated from riddles and bugs?
Happy 18th birthday.
You're a grown woman now.
Are you in love?
I can't give you love advice,
but I'm sure whoever you choose
is a wonderful person.
Happy birthday, Ann.
You've lived for 20 years now. That's amazing.
But remember that even adults are allowed to complain sometimes.
Whenever you're feeling down, remember that I am with you.
Ann.
I will always, always be watching over you.
Great work, Violet.
You did so many!
These letters are to be delivered to Ann Magnolia for the next fifty years.
You wrote 50 letters?
It was your first long trip in a while.
Were you okay?
-It was not a problem. -But this is so great.
She's going to look forward to these coming every year.
Yes, but…
by the time they arrive…
her mother will…
She's still so little.
She gets so lonely.
And Ann's mother has to leave her precious daughter behind.
She'll be left all alone…
in that mansion.
I…
I had to hold back my tears the whole time I was at the mansion.
Yes.
But, Violet…
they will reach her.
The letters you wrote.
Honestly, I've never thought about it.
I think if someone has to die, they will.
Honestly, I don't think about death. I'm not afraid of death.
I've never thought free diving could lead to death.
[man, in English] Twenty seconds!
[man] Ten seconds.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Alessia Zecchini. Italy.
Four minutes. World record attempt.
[in Italian] Okay, look at me.
[man, in Italian] Alessia was born in the afternoon, at around 20 to five.
That night, I lay awake in bed, thinking
about my wife, about my daughter.
You never forget it.
When you long for something…
you can't forget it.
This is one of Alessia's school essays.
"Do you ever think that the people around you, your classmates,
your friends, your parents,
don't understand your dreams?"
[girl, in Italian] I want to achieve my dream at all costs.
I want to become a famous free diver.
Natalia Molchanova is my greatest idol.
I want to be just like her, a world champion.
[man, in English] Molchanova holds over 40 free diving records.
She's regarded as a legend in the sport's history.
[girl, in Italian] I'm really embarrassed about this great dream of mine.
It sounds like one of those things you say when you're a kid
when asked what you want to be when you grow up.
There are only a few people who understand my dream.
My dad is one of those people.
He understands my passion for the sea and for free diving.
I'd do anything to make my dream come true.
[Enzo, in Italian] If you don't have a dream to spur you on, you won't make it.
But the price you pay
is so high.
Alessia and Steve.
Their connection was very strong.
What brought them together?
I've always believed
that nothing ever happens to us by chance.
There's always a connecting thread.
Something that leads you down a certain road.
[man, in English] Alessia and Stephen really became a duet…
[man] …in many ways.
It was destiny that they found each other.
I accepted that he was doing a dangerous thing.
And I just kind of lived with that.
Dad, come on!
Dad, come on!
Come on!
[man] I've always been curious.
I was always kind of fascinated by wilderness, and animals, and the sea.
and animals, and the sea.
[Peter] Stephen loved being out in the wild.
The two of us would go swimming at 5:00 in the morning, as the sun was coming up.
I'd dive down. I would snorkel.
And he'd be holding my hand and pointing, with his own snorkel,
and pointing out fish here and fish there.
"What's the biggest this? What's the smallest that?"
"What's the… the least common whale? What's the most common whale?"
Those endless "Why?"
"What? Where?"
"How often? How many?"
His interest in nature started with us watching David Attenborough.
I'm in the middle of central New Guinea.
One of the few places left on the surface of the Earth
that are truly unexplored.
[Stephen] I always had it in my head that I wanted to be an explorer.
I always loved looking at places like the Amazon
and Congo, and Indonesia, and imagining what it's like to be there.
[boy] Keenan, looking good!
[Peter] When Stephen got to his teens, I left the family home.
I almost don't want to think about it.
I feel very bad about it in ma-- in ways.
He was very hurt. He was very-- He was heartbroken.
I do remember, when he was 17, having a row with him
about spending money on alcohol with his friends.
His mother was a bit worried about, was he starting to drink a bit early?
He was looking at, "What am I going to be after I leave school?"
"How am I going to follow my dream?"
He really hadn't a clue.
[Alessia, in Italian] By the time I was 13, I knew what I wanted to do.
It wasn't easy to find a class when I was a kid.
They were all men.
[man, in Italian] I remember Alessia turning up with her dad.
This little girl with blue eyes.
I remember that I didn't even hear Alessia's voice. She just laughed.
I think I had done about 100 meters.
It took us many years to reach those numbers.
The kid did 105 meters.
That's when you ask yourself some questions!
How will it all end?
We went to some competitions for free diving in the sea.
They dived from the boat using a rock as a counterweight.
[Alessia] And I said, "Let's see how deep I can go."
By holding your breath,
you get to understand a lot more about yourself.
I managed to descend to 52 meters.
-[man, in English] Well done! -[cheering] -[spectators] Brava! -[applause and laughter]
[Enzo, in Italian] To see such a young girl
reach such depths
attracted a lot of attention.
And then the federation releases a statement banning under-18s from taking part in official competitions.
banning under-18s from taking part in official competitions.
[Alessia] In my darkest moments, I cried.
There were arguments with my father, with my coach.
At that moment, I said, "What am I going to do now?"
[in English] Being told you're being best man is usually a very emotional,
bonding moment between friends.
However, I found out some months after the decision was made
and through one of the lads.
[Stephen] I didn't know what I was going to do with my life.
Also, I'm a bit worried…
I knew I didn't want to stay at home, settle down.
I knew that wasn't gonna happen.
[woman] Look who's there!
I just hope you're brave, pointing that thing at her.
[Stephen] But then my mother just got sick.
I don't want to ruin another tape.
[Peter] Maura got cancer.
[Peter] Both Stephen and his younger brother Gary were really close to their mother.
It was very upsetting for them.
[woman] You're taking their mammy.
They were a great lift to her.
She died at such an early age.
Stephen had seen firsthand how unjust fate can be.
It did inform his personal philosophies.
Live for today,
for you never know what's coming down the line.
So he wanted to drink up every last drop of the world.
[Stephen] The Amazon, Congo, and Indonesia.
It had always been a dream of mine to get to these places.
When I was young, I collected National Geographic.
I remember, it was a picture of a gorilla wading through this peat bog water,
and this photograph was taken in Northern Congo.
I was going to travel to Congo, and then find the gorillas.
It was kind of a daunting experience.
I'd never done anything like this.
[in French] What's your name?
Stephen. Steve.
-Stephen? -Yes.
-Huh. Are you Christian? -Yes.
-In Ireland, we are-- -Protestant?
No, Catholic.
[in English] Palm wine.
-[in French] Yes? -[laughter]
-[Stephen, in English] Hi. -Hello.
[Stephen] She's been the village queen for how long?
-[man] Six years now. -[Stephen] Six? Okay.
Looks like I'm staying here tonight with this family.
[Stephen] Apparently, everyone who crosses the river gets river blindness.
So I'm told that I have it now. I'll have to get some treatment.
At last.
Just over the Congolese border.
-So here we are. -[man] Okay.
[Stephen] It was one of my lifelong dreams to be in such a place. I was, I'd made it.
And this really lit something up inside me,
to do something really unusual with my life.
To find what I was searching for,
I knew I needed to take the less-traveled road.
[Alessia, in Italian] I wanted free diving to be my life.
So even though I saw four years as a really long time,
I said, "Okay. Come on, let's keep doing this."
Plenty of others would have said, "Okay."
"I'll do something else."
But not her. She carried on regardless.
She continued going to the pool,
to the sea.
Then you realize there's something that drives her.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
[Enzo] Once she turned 18…
she suddenly arrived, like a rocket.
[Homar, in Italian] She immediately showed her potential.
150 meters in the pool.
At first, it was, "Wow."
But Ilaria was better.
[in Italian] I certainly wasn't expecting this result.
[Ilaria, in English] I was the strongest in Italy.
Alessia was the only one that can get anywhere close to me.
[laughing] But Alessia, in that period, was a really… crazy head.
[man, in Italian] Here's Alessia Zecchini. Near the 200-meter wall.
Let's see if she turns.
No, she's coming out.
[Ilaria, in English] She was really young, with a teenage mind.
She was sad.
She was upset.
[in Italian] It was really tough. Hmm…
I knew if I pushed more, I wouldn't have come out well.
[announcer] Ilaria Bonin!
[man] Go on, Ilaria!
[Ilaria, in English] If you want to be the best
and you always take silver medal…
Ah, it's something that drives you mad.
[Enzo, in Italian] When someone out there is stronger than you,
it becomes another motivation.
[Alessia, in Italian] I had to improve so much to set an Italian record.
For me, it took watching Natalia's videos to realize how I could get there.
[in Russian] My advice is that mental relaxation is the foundation of free diving.
If we want to be successful underwater,
we should be relaxed, not running towards some goal.
[in English] She start to approach the competition in a different way.
She was so relaxed.
[man, in Italian] That's good. Stop.
[man, in Italian] An amazing 224-meter performance.
[in English] She was so satisfied when she reached the gold medal.
[man, in Italian] Congratulations for this new Italian title.
Yes, it's amazing. At last!
[Ilaria, in English] That moment was the beginning
of our deep friendship.
This result was always written.
She had some supernatural power with free diving.
But the pool was too small for Alessia.
The sea was really her home.
[Peter] Stephen thought that he'd meet his ultimate destiny somewhere in Africa.
With the lads in Ethiopia.
[Peter] Ethiopia, Sudan,
Sierra Leone…
-Nigeria. -[cheering]
He traveled with a lot of care and seriousness.
However, very bad things nearly happened on a number of occasions.
In Guinea, there was a popular uprising against the president.
There's been gunfire all morning.
Every so often, you hear, "bam, bam, bam."
[Peter] He was torn and conflicted.
He'd say, "I wonder, should I be doing what all my friends are doing?"
"Getting married. Some of them have children."
"What am I not doing that I should be doing?" "Am I right living my life the way I am?"
He asked me once
if I was disappointed in him.
Wandering around the world like this,
searching for something that he couldn't put his finger on.
[Stephen] Been thinking about family, my friends.
It is, without doubt, the lowest,
awfullest time of my life right now.
Anyway…
until tomorrow.
[Peter] He was going to come home and live the conventional life.
But before that, he was going to make one last stop.
Stephen always loved the sea.
He loved scuba diving out in the ocean.
He heard that there was a town in Egypt which is kind of a mecca for divers.
[Stephen] I recall going along the coast and just listening to the sea.
I got a real feeling of hope about this place.
[man] When Steve drive from Cairo by bus,
all the way to Dahab,
he just throw the bag in the room.
he just throw the bag in the room. He just, "Where's the bar? Let's go have a drink."
He just, "Where's the bar? Let's go have a drink."
Next day, he go diving.
He become a friend.
We see each other every day.
He loved the Bedouin culture. He learned Arabic.
We become like family.
[Peter] He stayed down there, making a living instructing scuba diving.
So I arrived here to do my Divemaster course,
and that was Steve.
He was my instructor.
Before long, we were hanging out daily.
And going out dancing.
[Mahmoud] Dahab, for Steve, a second home.
[Peter] He had a little house of his own. He just loved it.
'Cause he told me at one stage,
"I've discovered this new thing called free diving,
and it's the business."
[Kristof] Steve asked me to join him on a free dive session.
The first time I dived down, holding my breath,
all the problems and the shit from daily life just vanished.
It doesn't exist down there. It's beautiful.
Steve just fell in love with free diving.
And especially the Blue Hole.
You literally walk from the beach into an abyss.
Like, there is this gaping hole in the coral reef,
which really, like, wants you to go down there.
And then there's this arch, like a chapel underwater.
Unfortunately, it also has a… a bad reputation.
It took lives.
[man] This is the most dangerous dive site on Earth.
It's thought to have claimed over 100 lives.
[man] In terms of fatalities,
the Blue Hole is even more perilous than Mount Everest.
As well as myself,
there's only a handful of people who have free dived through it.
Natalia Molchanova was the only woman to do it.
[in Russian] Diving the Arch has left a lasting impression on me.
[man, in English] This is the dive that unlocked something within herself.
A fearlessness that she didn't know was there.
It made her the best free diver in the world.
With the Arch, you've got to know if you're ready for it.
It's a really deceiving place to dive.
You have to find the exit.
If you aren't able to see it clearly for any reason,
you're basically on your own.
If something does go wrong, there's no way to come up.
There's 30 meters of rock over your head.
[woman] Outside the Blue Hole,
there are the memory stones remembering the people who died there.
My boyfriend died in… in the Blue Hole,
My boyfriend died in… in the Blue Hole, just when I moved to Egypt.
just when I moved to Egypt.
It is dangerous because it is deep.
It is always the ocean.
And we are nothing.
[man] So you've said that your objective
is to become the second woman in the world, after Natalia Molchanova,
to conquer all the absolute world records.
So how long do you think this is gonna take you?
[Alessia, in English] I don't know. [laughs] Of course, it's a dream.
Really, a dream for every athlete, I think.
But it's really difficult.
[man, in English] Natalia Molchanova, champion of the deep,
holding over 40 free diving records,
some of them incredible, death-defying feats.
[in English] Today, my dive was 101 meters.
[man] That's 101 meters down and up.
More than two Statues of Liberty,
stacked ground to torch.
[woman] Natalia was the first female free diver to reach 101 meters
in competition.
And she held that number for a very long time.
So 101 was the magical number Alessia was trying to beat.
[in Italian] I want to improve by a few meters.
In fact, I hope to go well beyond 90 meters,
to then touch the three-digit number in a couple of years.
[in English] Everybody must have a dream and put all their effort in.
And really, everything is possible.
[host] Can you describe the feeling of diving at those-- those kind of depths?
Talk about the feeling on the body of the pressure.
[Alessia, in English] The deeper I'm diving,
the pressure compresses the air in my lungs,
until my lungs are the size of my fist.
After 30 meters, the pressure pushes me down.
It's called the free fall.
And this is, for me, the best part.
It feels like you are flying.
The silence, it's unique.
It's like being in the last quiet place on the Earth.
[Adam] There's a surrender element to it.
It's like a high.
But getting sucked to the bottom of the sea can be scary,
even for free divers.
You have to break this deep meditation.
'Cause coming back to the surface, that's when the work really starts.
You've gotta swim the length of a 70-storey skyscraper.
Swimming against all that pressure, it's like swimming against the current.
By then, your oxygen supply's already dwindled.
You're kicking hard so your heart rate's increasing,
burning that oxygen quicker.
You're getting to the point where you don't have enough oxygen to keep the systems going.
where you don't have enough oxygen to keep the systems going.
That's when you can have a blackout.
[William] The brain basically just turns itself off.
It doesn't mean that your brain is dying.
But it's kind of like a safety mechanism.
The brain preserves itself by shutting off all its functions.
And from that moment, you still have one or two minutes
before brain damage would start to occur.
[man] Right, one more.
[William] If you don't have the right kind of medical attention,
it can go downhill pretty quick.
It's definitely not something to be taken lightly.
[Kristof] For years, Steve and I were always trying to dive deeper.
It became like a game between us. I was going for the Belgian record.
He was chasing the Irish one, which was 61 meters.
When you start competing, you wanna push yourself.
[Kristof] He had a few blackouts in the beginning.
He likes to bang his head on the wall. You know, really, like, "Let's do this!"
And, like, "I can't, but I'm gonna do it anyway."
-[Kristof] How deep? -Sixty.
-Okay. -Shite.
[Kristof] But Steve never gives up.
And it made him very proud to be the best Irish.
[Peter] The other attraction of free diving was that it was a boundary.
A boundary to be pushed.
Free diving is an extreme sport.
And extreme sports have extreme consequences.
Stephen?
[Kristof] Steve had a really, really strong blackout.
The safety team just didn't know what to do with him.
[Kristof] He almost died there.
[Kristof] He didn't want anyone else going through that.
So he started to be interested in being a safety diver.
Steve had the best background for the job
because the only other person that can do a safety for a free diver
is a free diver.
As a scuba diver, you can't be a safety for a free diver
because they go up slowly to decompress.
So if something happens, you have to react fast.
[Stephen] 99% of all free diving incidents happen within the last ten meters.
If there is an issue, we close the airways so they can't swallow water,
and we take them to the surface.
[woman] Please get out of the way for the safety.
[Kristof] He worked very hard to make a name for himself.
No. I'm doing it myself. So, uh…
[Kristof] After a while, Steve got the chance to be on the safety team in Kalamata,
which was his first international big competition.
[man] That's all good. Put it down.
[Adam] Natalia's son, Alexey Molchanov,
was the men's world record holder at the time.
He was going for the deepest dive ever.
And his mom is watching.
Safety, keep your distances. Eighty.
[Kristof] Steve was the first safety.
That means he has to dive the deepest.
[Adam] Stephen kicked down to 30 meters.
[Kristof] You have to know, as a safety diver,
you take in a mouthful of air, you go down,
and if everything goes right, you just swim up together.
You're never there for longer than a minute.
But Steve was already waiting at 30 meters for quite some time,
-so he's running out of air. -[beeping]
Come on, Alexey.
3'30, it's a very long dive time.
Andrea, you go down as well.
-Trouble. -Yeah.
[woman] Trouble?
[Kristof] Steve started to have contractions.
He's seconds away from the blackout.
But then he saw Alexey get into trouble around 40 meters.
Split-second decisions.
Save Alexey or save himself.
[Stephen, in English] Breathe, Alexey. Breathe.
-[man] Breathe, Alex. -[Stephen] Breathe for me.
-[Stephen] Breathe. -Breathe, mate. You're good.
[Alexey, in English] I had severe lung damage.
My mama told me that Steve saved me.
I am very grateful for his… this selfless act.
[laughing] And that was, like, my first meet with Stephen, this accident.
[Kristof] From that moment on, he was really the star of the competition.
Everybody knew him.
Stephen Keenan. [laughing]
Who saved the world champion.
One of the things about that story was how amazing the safety diver was.
At that time, it was the deepest blackout safety dive in competition.
I consider that an act of heroism.
To save Natalia's son,
Stephen took his job as a safety diver so seriously that he put himself at risk.
[in Italian] We're on day three of training.
I'm really pleased, because I've already beaten my personal best.
I've done 88 meters.
[Francesca, in English] Alessia was inching closer and closer to that magical number, 101 meters.
But she wasn't the only one.
[man] Excellent dive.
[Francesca] Hanako Hirose of Japan was a strong challenger.
[in Japanese] Can I have a message regarding the competition?
This time, I'm going to get the world record.
[man] Thank you.
[Adam, in English] Hanako has an innate connection to the sea.
It's something she was just born to do.
[Hanako, in Japanese] When I dive,
I often imagine myself swimming…
like a whale or dolphin.
[Francesca, in English] Hanako was going deeper and deeper and deeper.
And Alessia had to respond.
[in Italian] Alessia Zecchini was extraordinary.
Her dive was extremely elegant in every respect.
[William, in English] We had this amazing rivalry between Hanako and Alessia.
Hanako very consistently moved through the depths.
[Francesca] Alessia would come back at her.
[William] Eighty-nine meters.
[Francesca] Ninety.
-[cheering] -[William] Ninety-two.
[Francesca] Ninety-three.
[woman] Tell us how deep your dive was.
[in English] Ninety-four meters.
-[in Italian] How many meters? -Ninety-four.
Wow. With Zecchini, we're not gonna stop.
[William] There had been this dominance by Natalia Molchanova for so many years.
And then suddenly, these women were so close.
But when you push close to a limit, trying to set world records,
there's a lot that can go wrong.
She is considered to be one of the greatest athletes ever
in what is one of the world's deadliest extreme sports.
Free diving.
Natalia Molchanova went for a dive on Sunday, and she simply vanished.
[Francesca] Natalia Molchanova disappeared off the coast of Spain.
They didn't recover her body.
[man] Molchanova's son, Alexey, a record-breaking free diver himself,
told the New York Times,
"It seems she'll stay in the sea. I think she would like that."
[Alessia, in Italian] It was all too surreal.
I was shocked.
It was really sad because she was so strong.
[woman, in English] We lost Natalia Molchanova.
And in recognition of her great accomplishments,
please join me for a one-minute breath-hold.
[Adam] It shocked the free diving world.
They realized that they're more at risk than they thought.
Because if it can happen to Natalia, the greatest ever,
it can happen to anybody at any time.
[Alessia, in Italian] After Natalia's accident,
I began to realize that it could be dangerous.
I was going deeper and deeper.
It's black. It's dark. You feel locked inside.
You can see things that don't exist.
I was too scared.
I wanted to turn around and go back.
I didn't feel safe.
[Peter, in English] Stephen had an idea
that he could use his own experience as a safety diver
to open this center for free diving.
Stephen and his friends saved some money.
They built a premises on the seafront in Dahab.
Here, uh… in front of my free diving shop.
This is where I'm working.
[Peter] He was very proud to tell me
he was finally making a success of his business,
following his dream.
[Kristof] I was so proud of him.
He finally had this purpose.
Hey, Steve. Hi!
[Stephen] Hello, hello!
It's a nice, chilled evening in Dahab free divers.
When I first met him, I was super intimidated.
He had this massive reputation as the best safety diver.
I heard about the famous rescue he did for Alexey. [laughs]
I was looking for a place to teach free diving.
They asked if I wanted to join the team. I said, "Yes, sure."
I was in charge of social media.
And Steve's not the type to put himself in the limelight.
But for me, it was obvious.
"Steve, come on! Like, you're super famous in the community."
"You have to start promoting yourself."
Because Stephen knew all the free divers,
they were able to invite all these big names,
like Alexey Molchanov, to give workshops.
And this attracted a lot of free divers.
The school became super famous.
[man] For you, what is success in life?
I suppose success is fulfilling your aspirations, goals, dreams.
I'm currently living in Egypt, where I run a free diving center.
I guess I'm happy in that respect. I like what I do.
Other parts of my life are not so successful, I guess.
Unfortunately, I'm a 38-year-old man, and I don't have any kids.
I suppose that's, people say, something that I haven't quite fulfilled.
He had some relationships in Dahab, but, uh,
nothing that lasted.
He would've liked to, like, fall in love and have a long-term relationship and kids.
and have a long-term relationship and kids.
Part of him was missing that side.
He needed to meet a super special person.
[man] Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me,
and for all the listeners of the show too.
[Alessia, in English] Thank you. It's a major pleasure.
[man] Do you think you push too hard sometimes
in search of records?
I guess that's, uh, maybe more typical of younger athletes.
[Alessia] Yeah, maybe, sure.
[Enzo, in Italian] We had no idea she was after the world record.
She doesn't like to worry us, so she wouldn't tell us.
[man, in English] What would you like to accomplish in the next few months?
[Alessia] I would like to go deeper.
I would like to do the world record.
[laughs] That's my goal.
[man] When is your next competition?
[Alessia] Vertical Blue.
[Francesca] Welcome to Vertical Blue in the Bahamas.
We have 42 competitors from all around the globe
who are announcing ten different national records.
[Francesca] Vertical Blue is like the Wimbledon of free diving.
It's gonna be a beautiful day. Lot of great dives going on today.
[Francesca] Only the best of the best are invited.
Alessia Zecchini, and I'm from Italy.
[Francesca] Within the competition,
there is an exceptional team of medics and safeties.
Stephen, want to introduce the safety team?
I wanna make sure there's a good dynamic between the safety team and athletes.
That's vitally important to me.
Stephen was working as a chief of safety in Vertical Blue.
Being responsible for the overall safety of this, like, one of the biggest free diving events in the world.
There will be two safeties always to meet you, a deep and shallow.
The deep will meet you
between anywhere from 20 to 40 meters, depending on the dive.
[William] We take safety very seriously at Vertical Blue.
One of the only incidents,
fatal incidents that's happened in competition,
was a death here of an American athlete, Nick Mevoli.
[Nick] Never take a dive for granted.
You don't know what… you don't know what dive is gonna be your last.
you don't know what dive is gonna be your last.
[Francesca] Nick had a long history of pushing a little bit too hard.
And things catastrophically went wrong.
Nick had a lung squeeze.
[William] With the lung squeeze,
the blood vessels inside your lungs can burst
and leak blood into your air spaces.
[Francesca] We're talking about tissue that is torn
and then scarred.
If you are consistently injuring yourself, it's cumulative.
[William] And ultimately, that led to Nick getting a very bad squeeze.
And we… we couldn't save him.
[Stephen] Of course, we have our medics who will be giving a pep talk as well.
Okay, I'll keep this pretty quick.
If we think someone might be in danger, we have the authority
If we think someone might be in danger, we have the authority to tell a diver that they cannot dive any longer.
I always say to them, "I want you to go home."
"To be able to get on that plane and go home to your family."
And secondly, I don't ever want them to be
that diver that's on oxygen at the age of 40
because they've messed up their lungs so terribly.
[William] In competition, we have to retrieve a tag
attached to the bottom plate at target depth as a proof.
[Francesca] She's reaching for her tag.
[William] A white card is a 100% valid performance.
-[man] Yeah! -Yes!
[Alexey] As soon as somebody helps you, or you lose control,
even on the surface, that's disqualification.
It's a red card.
[William] Over two weeks of competition, the athletes get six attempts each.
[Alexey] It's very simple.
The deepest dive wins.
…is coming to meet you.
Okay.
[Alessia, in English] I want to do so much. Yeah.
A world record, that's the main point. So, I mean, it's super important for me.
[Francesca] It was clear that Alessia was after the world record.
So she was going to push her limits.
Unfortunately, Alessia had a problem with the dark.
And Vertical Blue is unique in that it's this collapsed cave.
It's like going into space.
[Francesca] She's on her way back.
We've got Stephen Keenan, who's our deep primary safety,
and he's going to meet her.
[man, in Italian] Well done, Alessia.
-[woman] Breathe. -[man] Breathe.
-Breathe, breathe, breathe. -[woman] Breathe. Breathe.
-[in English] I'm okay. -[man speaking Italian]
[in English] I'm okay.
[Francesca] The judges are conferring.
I'm sorry, Alessia, red card.
[man 1, in Italian] Breathe. [man 2, in English] Grab her. Keep her up.
[Francesca] Support her. Just support her.
[man 2] Just support her head.
-[man 1, in Italian] Breathe. -[in English] Somebody hold her.
-[man 1, in Italian] Breathe. -[in English] Somebody hold her. Hold her for me. Up.
Up. You okay?
Come on. Hold her.
[Alexey] She was really pushing hard,
experiencing blackouts several times.
A lot of free divers were not approving her way.
[Leigh] I'm checking Alessia for potential lung squeeze.
So I did ask her, "Are you coughing up any blood?"
And, um… and she said no.
And, um…
And, in all honesty, I kinda… I didn't believe her.
[Francesca] Listen.
You can't do that again.
Not here.
I want you to succeed.
That is why I want you to plan.
You-- you gotta quell the horses.
[Leigh] We told her she couldn't dive for a day or two.
She gets mad, and she goes and swims across the bay.
And being that she just blacked out,
we don't want her to have an issue, you know, a mile away.
[woman] Alessia!
[William] She didn't win too many friends with that behavior.
Some people saw it as…
yeah, the wrong kind of reaction.
[Leigh] Alessia had a very high temper, and, boy, you knew it.
[in Italian] Why the hell are you getting angry? You had a bad start. Chill out.
[Francesca, in English] There were hecklers
who said she didn't look like she could muscle up these depths.
The Internet trolls were robust in their criticism.
[in Italian] Hello. I'm making this video to reassure everyone who cares about me that I'm fine.
And to disprove the rumors on Facebook that I passed out at 20 meters.
I had no problems with a lung squeeze.
The dive overall went well, and I ask you not to write lies.
[in English] Keep the head in a neutral position, not letting it hyperextend.
The tongue and liquids and fluids can go down into the larynx
and cause more of a spasm.
[Leigh] We would have a meeting every morning to go over every single diver.
[Stephen] She was out for a while but remembered nothing.
She just said she came up and there she was. Okay?
[Leigh] Stephen was so good at knowing the ones that could be in danger.
He studied them, and he knew their weaknesses.
He would say, "We gotta watch out for this one."
And he was dead-on every time.
Kind of freakishly so.
With Alessia, it was driving Stephen absolutely crazy,
because he was seeing all of these little things that she was doing wrong,
and that it was probably contributing to her blackouts.
And so he started training with Alessia during the competition break.
[in Italian] Breathe.
Breathe.
-[in English] Are you okay? -I am okay.
[Alessia, in Italian] He inspired trust straight away.
I saw in him the only one who could coach me.
[in English] Are you okay?
[Alessia, in Italian] The thing that struck me most was his eyes.
They were blue, so blue, like the sea.
His gaze was enough.
Before diving, we would look at each other.
And this gave me strength.
Feeling his presence made you feel safe in the darkness.
[woman, in English] We see a special relationship between the safety diver and the athlete.
For example, Alessia asks about you in every deep dive she does.
It's massively important, because, um… free diving is a very psychological sport.
Okay? There's many little facets that can affect a dive.
And if somebody, when diving, wants to feel secure,
they're very happy if they're diving with someone they're familiar with,
and they know that the safety diver is familiar with them.
How they dive. The speed they go at. The habits they might have.
Things to look out for that we know.
[Homar, in Italian] There was a relationship that went beyond free diving.
With some people, you have an understanding.
You don't need words or time.
I saw this connection.
[in English] The first thing you did-- And then you went, like, "No…"
[man] Okay.
Oh my God.
[woman, in Italian] Your biggest opponents for breaking the record are the Japanese.
Do you fear them?
I certainly fear my Japanese opponents.
[Hanako, in Japanese] One hundred meters. It was a big number.
A Japanese record.
And I was nervous.
And Stephen came and he grabbed me by the shoulders in a very serious way.
I remember him saying, "It's going to be okay. I've got you."
[Stephen, in English] Second safety.
[Francesca] She's with both the safeties now.
-[Stephen] She's slowing down a bit. -[Francesca] She's slowing down a little.
Here she comes.
-[in English] Okay… -I'm okay. -[Francesca] Oh, yeah! -[cheering]
And the judges say… white card!
Hanako Hirose of Japan,
first female after Natalia to make 100 meters in competition.
This is a huge dive!
[Francesca] When Hanako made the 100-meter mark,
that set a fire underneath Alessia.
[Francesca] Stephen Keenan is going to meet her.
-[man] Forty meters. -[Francesca] Here she comes.
-[man] First safety. -[Francesca] She's with the first safety.
Now, hope for Alessia.
[man, in Italian] Breathe.
[Stephen, in English] Come on!
I'm okay.
-[man] Yeah! Yeah! -[cheering]
[Francesca] Stay up! Stay up! Stay up!
-Stay up! -[team speaking Italian]
-[man] She has the tag. -[Francesca] She has the tag!
Stay up, Alessia, stay up.
And the judges say
white card!
It was amazing. It was just… We were just, like, flabbergasted.
Oh my gosh.
She blacked out three days in a row, then she gets a world record.
What the hell? You know? [laughs]
We were so happy for her, 'cause that's all she wanted.
[Alessia, in Italian] It was wonderful to hug Steve after the dive.
It was simply fantastic.
Today, I'm so happy.
I achieved the dream I've had for so long.
[in English] Right, cheers to Alessia.
-[in Italian] Hi. -Hi, Ale. Are you happy?
So happy!
-You were great, you know that? -Yes, I know.
What are you thinking now?
I'm really happy. I kick ass at Vertical Blue.
Once you start touching…
world records,
you raise the bar so high.
That's when things get worrying.
[William, in English] The athletes had to email myself with their announcement for the final day
to decide how deep they wanted to attempt to go.
[Alexey] In free diving, we announce secretly.
The idea behind it is that we should announce safely what-- what we can do.
There's a little bit of strategy and chess.
If you announce too much, maybe you're not able to perform it.
But if you announce too little,
maybe someone else walks away with the title.
[Alessia, in English] It's super hard to choose.
If I do a mistake, it will be bad. I will have a red card.
It's…
[sighs] It's hard.
-[radio playing hip-hop music] -[car horn blares]
[woman, in Italian] You've talked about limits. What is Alessia Zecchini's limit?
I don't think a limit exists.
It doesn't exist until I choose to quit.
[Francesca, in English] Welcome back to Vertical Blue.
Today could be the most historic day in free diving.
We're here with our host and athlete, William Trubridge.
Talk to me about what you're seeing from the women especially.
[William] Just epic.
I don't think we've seen anything like that in the history of the event.
It seems they have still got more in the tank,
so I think we can probably expect some more fireworks from them as well.
[Francesca] We have even more exciting diving coming up.
Another world record attempt announced.
[woman] Five, four, three, two, one.
[Francesca] And Hanako Hirose is trying to make history
to take the world record, deepen it by one meter to 103.
She's already down below 90 meters.
-And… -[woman] 100 meters.
[Francesca] One hundred meters!
-[woman] Touchdown. -[Francesca] Touchdown!
Stand for Hanako Hirose of Japan, 103 meters!
Come on, Hanako.
Make that big swim back up.
-[woman] Two forty-five. -[Francesca] Two forty-five.
Diver in sight,
Hanako Hirose of Japan,
hoping for 103 and a world record.
I'm okay.
-[Francesca] Whoa! She has the tag. -[man] Yeah!
[Francesca] White card!
Hanako was clean as a whistle.
[in Italian] World record, 103 clean. Fantastic.
[Francesca, in English] Whoever comes up first, and they do it clean,
is just adding pressure for the person who's gonna go next.
[William] To then go into the water and attempt a record very soon after that
is a big ask.
[woman] Ten seconds.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Alessia Zecchini, Italy.
104 meters world record attempt.
[Enzo, in Italian] On streaming, you can see the whole event.
[Francesca, in English] Final record attempt of the day.
[Enzo, in Italian] As you see her go down…
you get a flood of worries.
[woman, in English] Someone check the sonar.
[Francesca] Surface safety, check the sonar, please.
[woman] Yeah, I have no signal. Can someone check?
[woman] Yeah, I have no signal. Can someone check? -[Francesca] And Alessia-- -[woman] Should be at 80…
-[Francesca] And Alessia-- -[woman] Should be at 80…
I have no signal.
[Enzo, in Italian] The sonar allows them to see
whether they've stopped. [Francesca, in English] …forty-five…
We're having a little interference in our sonar.
-[woman] Two minutes. -[Francesca] Two minutes has passed.
-[woman] Eighty. -[Francesca] We're not sure.
-We're not sure. -[woman] She's okay.
-[Francesca] Dive time 2'15. -[woman 1] 2'15. -[woman 2] Seventy meters. -[Francesca] Two-one-five.
[Enzo, in Italian] We should see her coming out by now.
[woman 2, in English] First safety.
-[man] Here's Alessia. -[man 2, in Italian] Breathe, breathe!
I'm okay.
[Enzo, in Italian] There she is!
She's no longer swallowed by endless darkness.
[Francesca, in English] The judges are conferring. She has a tag.
We don't know what's going on, but she has a tag.
World record, 104!
She just showed up and kind of blew everybody out of the water.
She set the world record,
and I think she silenced a lot of those naysayers.
It was clear that Alessia was a force of nature,
and she was here to stay.
[in Italian] I got the new world record of 104 meters, and I'm so happy.
Thanks to all. Fantastic! That's enough for now. Ciao!
[in English] And in first place,
with an incredible dive today of 104 meters,
and a new world record,
Alessia Zecchini!
[Leigh] Alessia gave Stephen the biggest hug.
He really did believe in her.
There was just something about her that he knew that she could do it.
He didn't doubt her for a second.
[in Italian] Give a round of applause for Alessia Zecchini!
-Hi, Alessia. -Hi.
-Welcome. -Thank you.
Beautiful, talented, young. You've got it all.
So, nine world championship gold medals, four silver,
one bronze.
The ultimate record, the most famous one, the one you are proudest of,
so much so, you put it around your neck,
the 104-meter world record.
Any other ambitions, aims, goals?
[Francesca, in English] Even after becoming the deepest woman in the world,
Natalia was still her inspiration.
Alessia was motivated by all the achievements
that Natalia had garnered in her lifetime.
And there was one thing left.
The Arch in Dahab.
People thought she couldn't do it.
And she wanted to prove, both to herself and to everyone else, that she could.
As fate would have it,
Stephen wanted her to train with him in Dahab.
And there was definitely an amazing connection
between Alessia and Stephen.
[in Italian] Stephen told us he was going to pick Alessia up at the airport.
"Look what I made."
He pulled out
an airport sign with "Alessia" written on it.
He was really excited, really happy.
He wanted everything to be perfect for Alessia's arrival.
I haven't told you where we are yet.
I'm in Dahab for training.
It's beautiful here.
Okay, everything is ready.
We're here at the diving center, packing everything.
Then we'll head to the sea. I'll show you the Blue Hole.
[Alessia] He seemed more excited than I was.
And I found that quite endearing.
[man, in English] That's prickish.
[Alessia, in Italian] But we were both a bit awkward.
[Lily, in English] It was the first time that we would see somebody cross the Arch,
and being involved in the dive was super exciting.
We're gonna go training together.
I was like, "Oh my God. I'm gonna train with Alessia. Dear Jesus!"
And she shows up with a ham sandwich and a can of Coke.
I was like, "Oh my God. Okay, I love her already."
Okay, Alessia. On your feet.
[man] I knew she'd just set a world record.
She matched the world record one day in training.
It was inspiring
to see someone do these depths that I'd kinda only dreamed of doing.
And you could tell, like…
Like, even Steve, he'd be like, "Ah, she makes it look too easy."
You know? But it was… That was, like, that was her. [laughs]
[Lily] Alessia and Steve were together all the time.
He was coaching her and preparing her for the Arch,
sitting down every evening after her training for weeks,
going through everything, telling her what she should do next.
It's another evening in Dahab free divers.
[Lily] Then they were together every evening.
[Stephen] Say hello.
Hello!
Say hello, guys.
[all] Hey.
[Lily] It was an amazing summer.
They had a very special connection.
It was just a really good match. [laughs]
Simon! Belated happy birthday, bud. Hope you had a great one.
Sorry it's only me to say happy birthday.
Or actually, no, there's somebody else. Wait.
Happy birthday!
[Alessia, in Italian] He adored being in the desert.
The happiness we shared was amazing.
[Lily, in English] We thought, "Okay, this could be something pretty special."
We are gonna win the world championships.
We are gonna make world records.
And this amazing lady
is going to win the world championships.
True that.
[Homar, in Italian] We were all together that evening. It was our last night.
And I remember he turned to Alessia and said,
"You'll be the first woman to do the Arch after Natalia Molchanova."
We told Stephen,
"Look after Alessia."
And obviously, as a safety, he told me…
"Leave it with me."
[in Italian] We're discussing the dive before getting in the water.
This is my coach, Steve, and these are some other athletes.
We'll get in the water soon.
I'm preparing all the gear.
We're ready to get in the water.
[Kristina, in English] Steve asked me to take photos of this dive.
I took pictures doing briefing for all safety divers.
Steve really went through each detail.
Everybody knew exactly what they were supposed to do.
[Lily] The plan was Alessia would dive 52 meters, pulling herself on the rope,
and then, entering the Arch, swim horizontally for 30 meters.
As she arrived on the other side of the Arch,
the safety line should be there in the middle.
Steve would be there at the end of the line waiting for her.
Natalia crossed the Arch with a monofin.
[Nathan] What Alessia prepared for was a dive without the monofin,
which is the hardest way you can do it.
[Lily] Maybe she wanted to do it that way to be better than the best free diver ever.
Everything was timed.
They had made practice runs
to know how long exactly it takes her to go down to 52 meters,
how long it takes for her to swim horizontally for 30 meters.
And we had a countdown,
so we would make sure that Steve would be already there before she arrived.
[Kristina] I go down with the other two technical divers
with a camera to do the filming.
[Nathan] After she goes down, my job was to hold the rope,
wait until we felt her hit the bottom,
go down a few meters, look.
If she wasn't coming back up, come up and we're done.
After she swam through the Arch,
she was relying on finding the rope on the other side to pull herself back up.
[man] Five, four, three, two, one, zero.
[Nathan] We watched Alessia go down.
I'm feeling the rope, so I can tell when she reaches the bottom.
[Nathan] After we felt her let go of the rope, we'd give an okay sign
to tell the other safety divers that she entered the Arch.
That should've triggered Steve to go down.
[Lily] Ten seconds.
[Lily] I started to give the countdown to Steve.
[Lily] Five, four, three.
He asked me for ten more seconds.
I just didn't really understand why, because, um… so far, everything had been going according to plan.
so far, everything had been going according to plan. So maybe the heart was going a bit too fast for his liking,
So maybe the heart was going a bit too fast for his liking,
so he wanted to take a few more seconds to be really ready.
I really don't know, because you can't discuss with him,
because he's preparing for his dive, so he's not gonna talk.
It took him a little bit extra to give me the signal.
[Kristina] Alessia is coming out of the Arch, but Steve is not there.
She doesn't see the rope.
She is swimming the wrong direction.
She didn't realize that she was already out.
[Lily] I have, uh, one hand on the rope.
I'm waiting for the feel of the pull to say that they're starting to come up.
The pull is not coming.
I start to worry.
Maybe she was swimming a little bit slower.
Let's wait a little bit longer.
[Nathan] They should've been coming up
by the time we swam across to the other side.
I knew at that point something was wrong.
[Lily] Now it's too long.
Something is not right.
[Kristina] Alessia needs to go up immediately.
She didn't know that she's in completely the wrong place.
In one moment, Steve left the rope super quickly.
As a scuba diver, I cannot do shit.
I was very far.
I was just screaming.
[Lily] I could see all the way to the end of the line.
There was no one.
[Nathan] We just can't see them.
Think fast. Maybe the water current took them.
We would need to search a much bigger area.
Thirty meters away, there was loads and loads of tourists snorkeling.
We're looking for someone amongst a mess of people that can't properly swim.
[Lily] Everywhere I look, they're not there.
I decided to come up and see if I could see them on the surface.
[Lily] There was no explanation.
[Kristina] I was swimming as fast as I could.
I need to see if they are alive.
[Alessia, in Italian] The first meters, everything seemed normal.
Until I reached the Arch.
I remember while I was swimming, I felt it was a bit strenuous.
There was a problem.
Steve wasn't there, but neither was the rope.
I just tried to follow the reef,
trying to see where the rope was.
But I realized I couldn't find it.
I'd made a mistake.
I suddenly saw Steve in front of me.
I remember he took my hands.
And he swam, bringing me to the surface.
I don't remember the first seconds when I surfaced.
I only remember, after a while,
looking around and not understanding a thing.
[Kristina, in English] Steve's face was in the water.
And I started screaming on her, like, "Turn him face up!"
But I didn't realize that she had blacked out.
And when I started screaming, because I really screamed a lot,
she basically woke up, and she started acting immediately.
[in Italian] Maybe I could have done more.
If I had been more conscious, I don't know.
[Nathan, in English] If you are on your own, and you start blacking out,
you have to be on your back. If you're not on your back, you're done.
Steve probably took his last seconds of consciousness
to make sure she was in a position that she'd survive in
at the expense of ending up face down.
[in Italian] The worst thing is we couldn't do anything.
We couldn't save him.
He rescued me, but I couldn't rescue him.
He was a hero, and he showed it till the end.
[Kristina, in English] You can see in the last photo, he lost his life to save hers.
I was diving the lighthouse.
Like, actually, over there.
I finish my dive, I…
I finish my dive, I… I look at my phone,
even, like, with my suit on, like, I…
even, like, with my suit on, like, I… My phone, I look at my phone, like, "What?"
Like, there are 50 missed calls.
And I received a phone call.
Something happened to Steve.
And…
It… They couldn't bring him back.
My first reaction was, "Shit. I wasn't there."
"I could've saved him if I would have been there."
[Francesca] He was choosing her over himself.
I'm very clear that he knew that someone was gonna die that day,
and he wasn't gonna let it be her. [sniffles]
[in Italian] I would give my life.
Mine instead of his.
[in English] He wouldn't… he wouldn't have forgiven himself if he wouldn't have saved her, you know?
[Francesca] Everybody, we'll just dive until we feel
we want to release our flowers
and give thanks for such a wonderful human in our lives,
sending all the good energy
that Stephen gave to all of us.
[Peter] Everybody who loved Stephen did a big underwater vigil.
They all held their breath for 39 seconds to represent each year of his life.
There was never ever a death
which moved the place the way that this… this one did.
It was hundreds of people. I mean, everybody.
How? How can one person touch so many?
He must've been a pretty special person, right?
Part of grief is kind of selfish.
And the selfish part of grief… makes me miss him. I miss him.
I miss him not coming home. I miss him in my life.
But I am much consoled by how he lived.
He was pretty courageous.
The Masai plains.
We're completely alone.
Jebel Toubkal.
Nice mountain in North Africa.
[Peter] Stephen was searching for something all of his life.
I did it! [laughs]
[Peter] He had found something he loved
and somebody who shared his dream.
Alessia and the sea. They were all he needed.
[Alessia, in Italian] He will always be with me.
I remember his eyes…
and try to remember all the things he'd tell me.
To live, to be happy.
To believe in myself.
[in English] Enjoy yourself to the max!
Okay? Kiss.
[Alessia, in Italian] I try and remember his hugs.
He's the person who made me realize what it really means to hug someone.
From the hug, you'd understand how deeply he cared about you
and all the feelings you could share together.
He gave his life
for Alessia.
A pain like this stays with you.
You go on.
But that wound is there, and it won't heal.
[Alessia] He will always be in my heart.
A chaotic state situated in the Pacific Ocean.
The war between North Namburi and South Namburi has been going on for the past five years.
has been going on for the past five years.
Then a ceasefire was called in Namburi four months ago.
A humanitarian mission escorted by PASKAU, Royal Malaysian Air Force Special Force
was deployed to Namburi
for a peace-keeping mission for as long as the ceasefire lasts.
Today,
the ceasefire in Namburi ends.
They need to return home before they are trapped in this civil war.
The ceasefire of the Namburi Civil War has reached a dead end.
The South Namburi separatist militants
now control more than half of the Namburi district.
They are killing everyone who is siding with the North Namburi military.
The North Namburi military is pursuing the rest of the South Namburi separatist faction.
Even children and women
are not spared from being victims of this civil war.
The international community has sent humanitarian aid
during the ceasefire.
This includes Malaysia which has sent a humanitarian mission delegation
along with RMAF services.
However, this does not stop the violence in Namburi.
The death count has reached…
Pause right here.
The fighting is starting again.
Everyone has left except for us.
Rewind it.
This is all we have?
It's in there.
Open the insert folder.
Why open it? Time to go home.
Enough. Let's continue editing in KL.
Ah, come on!
When do we take off?
The others have left.
It's just us.
Push it up.
They are after us! Hurry!
You are dead, foreign traitors.
Everyone stand down. We'll wait until they have left.
-Susan! Bring the stretcher！ -Down!
-Paco! -Put him down!
Hold the wound!
Hold it.
A southern militant.
He is dangerous.
Help Susan!
-Don't record! -Excuse me?
We're just doing our job.
Don't sensationalize this.
-Everyone out. -We're leaving.
Susan, Paco, we must hurry.
Now!
Sir. We have no time for this.
If you were me, what would you do?
Even if he's a kid, he's a human being.
Have you forgotten the principles of the PASKAU?
You've made enemies with the most dangerous militia of Namburi.
Adib.
Paco!
Hujan.
Everything settled?
You really are disgusted with our military, eh?
CAMERAMAN ERA BERITA REPORTER
Look at this.
JET FLIES LOW, CIVILIANS FILE SUIT
What's your problem, Zaf?
Always with your 'beat-up'.
Shoot the traitors.
Yes, sir!
We grew up together.
We grew up sharing the same dream,
a dream of flying together.
Every struggle
surely has a beginning.
Every beginning
surely springs from a choice.
Left, right, left…
Adib.
There.
That's the Captain Adnan I wanted to tell you about.
I heard a story
that he once rescued more than 50 refugees.
Isn't that crazy?
He's the youngest PASKAU awarded the Commander of Valor medal.
When did you take the photo with Hana?
It's an old photo.
BASIC FLYING COURSE FINALIST
When were you going to tell me?
I wanted to tell you.
I knew you'd be upset.
Of course I'm upset.
We promised to fly together.
What's this?
If you want to fly, go ahead.
-That's your dream. -It's our promise, Adib.
Here…
Whatever.
Forgive me, Zaf.
Our paths are vastly different.
This is my journey.
Here.
Wow.
Now this is what I call wife material.
You're so full of it, Adib.
Wait here. Let me go get my IC.
Where to, Commando?
What's wrong with you?
Snapping like this.
What else do you want from me?
You're flying.
I'm with PASKAU.
We all have our strengths.
You're dating Hana, yes?
Yes.
I'm dating Hana.
What's your problem?
The problem right now
is that you're going out with my sister behind my back.
I knew it.
You're still mad at me 'cause I joined PASKAU.
Don't drag Hana into this.
It's not about that, Adib.
You tend to change your mind about things.
Don't let my sister be a victim.
Can you guys stop it?
Whether a PASKAU or a pilot, you're the same.
You've been friends since you were kids. Why fight?
Zaf.
Please respect my decision.
Whomever I choose.
Do have some respect for Zaf.
Like it or not,
Zaf is still my brother
and may become your brother-in-law.
Maybe?
Yes, maybe.
Enough. We're off on our date.
Since then,
Zaf and I were never on good terms.
We may be at odds,
but eventually it may come to pass.
That was what I hoped for.
We're here for a reason.
It's not because of luck.
If you choose to keep on fighting,
never back down, not even an inch.
Keep on fighting.
As long as we live.
Understand?
Yes, sir!
Go! Go! Go!
Hurry!
We got them.
Good. Now go kill all survivors.
Send the death squad to take over the tunnel.
Move!
Understood!
Go to the tunnel and kill all the traitors.
Now go!
Prepare for all possibilities.
Make sure every communication line is open.
Get the approval from the higher authorities.
Activate SAR.
Bring them home.
Paco?
What are you doing?
Who is this?
Who is this kid?
Paco?
Paco?
I tried my best.
I think these were villagers from the east side.
Must be the work of the militants.
These people were supposed to have gone to the air base yesterday for supplies.
They're East Siders.
What else do they want?
Our sortie was fine. That day, it wasn't even your fault.
Our sortie was fine. That day, it wasn't even your fault. Hey, lowball. This place is for pilots who can fly.
Hey, lowball. This place is for pilots who can fly.
Not for flighty pilots, okay?
Bro, A400 went missing this morning at Namburi.
Isn't your beloved brother-in-law there now?
Paco.
Sir!
Your jacket is too bright.
Take off your jacket now!
They should be nearby!
Find them!
Sir.
What are you doing here?
I heard, sir.
I am requesting to be part of this mission.
You know your case is still under investigation, right?
We'll talk some other time.
Not now.
Mantis.
CROWDS PANIC SEEING RMAF PLANE FLYING LOW
You've breached our SOP by performing unauthorized low flying.
We will do a standard check flight.
In the meantime,
your category is "suspended".
Your flight status is also pending the BOI report.
You're the one handling my case?
You like to decide the fate of others?
Who decides your fate?
Me?
Or this Sukhoi?
Or is it all in your own hands?
We are being hunted.
Only the North Namburi military has surface-to-air missiles.
Mission, find assets and weapons.
Now we're here.
Find any survivors
and also the A400 data pack.
Because that's the only proof we have.
Then we move to the airbase.
Wait for rescue.
Move in silence.
Then we'll go back to KL?
I promise everyone will be back safely in KL.
Give me the latest satellite images.
Sir. Zafran recommended himself for this mission.
It's just that he still has a case under investigation.
He's the best pilot for this mission, sir.
Let's give a fair chance to everyone including Zafran.
Let them prepare the mission plan.
-I agree. Proceed. -Thank you, sir.
Why did you stop?
They are not far.
Find them!
Lejen.
We have to split up.
Stick to the plan.
Hujan.
Your beacon.
Easier for us to be found.
What was that?
Go find it!
Guys, keep searching.
Hujan.
Whose watch was it?
Whose watch?
-Stop it! -Your watch!
Your watch!
Lejen!
You mess with me one more time,
I'll kill you myself. Understood?
-Stop it! -Understood, sir.
Sir! Lejen! Here!
Matno.
We're stuck here, Matno.
I don't want to die here.
Lejen.
The militants came by truck.
It's down there.
Lejen. I found the data pack.
Paco.
Change into the militants' outfits.
Tell Hujan too.
We'll move to the airbase
by truck.
Understood?
-Understood. -Move.
Commander.
The government has ordered us to continue planning.
Noted, Dato' Sri.
I will go to Charlie Cube later.
Yes, Dato' Sri.
That's our true enemy, sir.
We have to move fast.
To ensure we attain that speed,
we have to fly light.
That's why we need to revise our weapon configuration.
To avoid detection,
we have to fly low, sir.
Sir.
My mission plan.
Matno.
I entrust this to you.
Keep this data pack
like it's your own life.
That's the only proof we have.
Yes, sir.
They got away.
Everyone be careful.
This is a South Namburi camp area.
Those are from the northern military.
Paco!
Paco, for real?
What are you doing?
We bring her along.
I can take care of her, Tuai.
Rock! Move, Rock!
Rock! Move, Rock! Rock!
It's them! It's them! It's them!
Matno, help!
Press on her neck.
-Huh? -Put pressure!
I can't feel anything.
I can't feel anything.
Sir. We have new info.
This is from the satellite feed.
Sir.
Based on this, these are our guys.
Their time zone is four hours ahead.
It's almost nightfall there.
We have to act fast.
A400M standby for combat deployment.
But once we get air picture from AWACS in Namburi,
we identify the SAM sites,
Keep trying to find the signal, Hujan.
Until you get it.
If you had shot that kid,
Susan would still be alive.
Can you stop munching?
Is your commanding officer sick?
What do you mean?
He promised
to keep us all safe.
We didn't ask for this.
But it still happened.
We trust Major Adnan.
I hope you will too.
Trust should be earned,
not demanded.
Natrah.
You're bleeding.
It's not my blood.
Stop! You useless Southern traitor.
Kill them all!
Die, you traitor.
Burn this place down!
Move out!
Lejen. We have to change course.
To evade our enemies.
Everyone move.
This is an open space.
The A400M plane disappeared from radar and is suspected to have crashed.
The RMAF is gathering more information.
They were here.
Burn it down.
Quickly!
We have to turn back.
We just went through the roadblock.
We can't go back.
We must press on.
You wanna cross that?
Help!
Hey!
Help!
Lara! My child!
Paco!
Paco!
Paco!
Paco!
Paco! Help!
Please help!
Paco!
Move!
Is Lara safe?
Lara
is safe.
Oh, Paco.
I know him, uncle, but
I still don't have any info.
I'm sorry.
Hana. Tell me what happened to Adib.
Why is it that when I ask, nobody knows anything?
We're still waiting, Hana. Including me.
What are we waiting for?
We still don't know their situation.
Maybe there's still…
What's wrong?
-We don't have… -What happened?
-Are they safe? -It's too early…
Sir. What's this, sir? Who's safe and who's not, sir?
Is it already known, sir?
-Calm down, sir. -Please tell us, sir!
Please, sir! Please, sir!
Please calm down, sir.
I'm sorry, everyone.
I'm not the officer in charge of this mission.
Any information
will be provided by my superiors. Sorry. Excuse me.
will be provided by my superiors. Sorry. Excuse me. Sir!
How long do we have to wait?
Zaf.
Zaf.
Zaf?
I know you guys aren't close anymore.
But I'm begging you, Zaf.
Please bring Adib home.
Lejen.
Help me click this.
Why did Corporal Paco do that?
That's his daughter.
She's already gone.
Paco ran over his own daughter,
Follow the original plan.
We go to the airbase.
Do we have to go through this?
No way.
The tunnel.
Lejen,
I think the tunnel is a bad idea.
So we cross that?
It's our only choice.
The best option.
-Hujan. -Yes?
Comm the airbase.
Get an update on the tunnel.
-Fast! -Okay!
Lejen. I suggest we seek higher ground to make contact.
The tunnel is dangerous.
We don't know the situation.
That way will expose us.
Follow the tunnel.
-It's the best way. -Lejen…
-It's the best way. -Lejen… Follow the plan.
Whatever happens,
you guys stay with me.
Sir.
Display it later.
Yes, sir.
From the intel we received,
survivors are on high ground
around the Namburi airbase.
We also believe they will use the tunnel
to shield themselves from militant attacks.
They're also equipped with surface-to-air Missiles
and also MiG-29 fighter jets.
for the Hornbill mission.
Yes, sir!
Very well, gentlemen.
Any latest satellite imagery?
-AWACS? -Sir.
Mantis.
Sir.
We have agreed to follow your flight plan.
Yes, sir.
Mantis.
The fate of those in Namburi rests in your hands.
Don't let them down.
God willing, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Bring them home.
Your plan has been authorized.
With the low flying… Their fate is in our hands, Spoon.
Either we are zeroes
or heroes.
Come.
Ah, we have work to do now.
They are inside. Go in.
Come.
Come here, woman!
It hurts if you fight.
Do not resist!
Hujan!
Gaban!
Take this girl.
Lejen!
Sir.
Let's go.
Useless.
Let's go!
Tuai!
Tuai!
Tuai!
Let's die together!
Hand me the bag.
Lejen.
Airbase has been compromised.
Lejen.
Find any usable weapons.
Get those MiG-29 ready to fly.
Tuai.
How much ammo?
Limited.
How's the airbase?
Compromised.
Orders?
Lejen.
Lejen, we have to secure the perimeter here.
-Are you okay? -I'm okay.
Check on the others.
What bracelet is that?
A gift from my son.
During his therapy.
He's autistic.
I have already tried my best.
Adib joined PASKAU because of me.
It's not easy being a leader.
I have failed.
But you didn't fail.
You managed to save me.
I should be eating a burger right now.
Watching a Blu-ray.
Gaming.
Anyways,
I'm here right now.
I don't understand how you guys can do all this stuff.
We joined PASKAU
so you guys don't have to do all this.
I also have a bad habit when I'm stressed.
Biting your nails?
When I'm stressed, I fart.
No wonder it smells.
Are you okay, Matno?
Okay.
My bag is the one that's not.
I'm sorry.
I made the wrong call.
Sir.
What happened was not yours or anyone else's fault.
Everything is destined.
But what I've learnt from someone that I admire is
to keep going.
To keep living…
to fight for those we leave behind.
Over there, they are praying for our strength, sir.
Don't let them down.
As long as we live.
Rock.
There's a possible exit.
There's a door.
Gaban!
Surveillance sensors ready.
Support element ready.
Fighter formation ready.
Mantis!
We're okay, right?
There are more important things than our egos right now.
We're okay.
I personally calibrated this SU jet for you.
Take care of it. Okay?
There's a ladder leading out.
Hurry, Rock.
There's no escape, foreign traitor!
Lejen!
One, two, three!
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Lejen?
Gaban.
You okay?
Tuai.
Gaban.
Take Lejen and the civilians to a safe place and hide.
Hujan. Yes?
You follow me.
We find contact on higher ground.
I'll find you guys later.
Commander.
Sir. We received our survivors' beacon signal.
-Bring them home. -Sir.
We got the LZ.
Rock, he's right.
We need to move.
Lejen!
Lejen!
Natrah got shot too!
Hujan!
Hujan!
Hujan!
Lejen!
Hujan! Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up!
Hujan!
They're close.
We have to move.
Rock,
bring them home safely.
Leave me.
Sir Adib.
Sir, what is this?
This is an order.
Continue onwards as long as we live.
Understand?
Go!
Enemy closing. Enemy closing! Go!
Sir! Sir!
Please.
Sir!
Thank you!
Adnan.
I repeat,
Danger Close, for real?
Our people are down there!
Mantis,
this is the Chief.
Mantis,
we have to decide now.
Mantis!
I hope none of our people got hurt.
Die, you scumbag!
I can see the target.
Gaban.
Shoot them!
Tuai!
Still there.
Gaban! Gaban!
Let's move! Let's move!
Go! You guys leave!
You guys leave! I'll cover you!
I'll cover you!
Are you a commando?
We never leave anyone behind.
Buddies until death.
Buddy, let's go!
He's still behind us!
Locked on us!
Let's move! Let's move!
We'll bring them home.
Welcome home, guys.
Welcome home.
We are gathered here as a family today.
We are here to receive the return of our real heroes.
They fought for us all,
and for the people whom they've never known.
Tigers die leaving behind its stripes.
Heroes leave this world leaving behind glory and valor
Heroes leave this world leaving behind glory and valor to be remembered until the end of time.
We live while awaiting our death.
But are our lives
full of good deeds?
Or filled with broken promises?
Before death comes,
we promise to keep on fighting.
Not for ourselves,
A FIGHTER'S WORTH
but we fight for those we leave behind.
Even if blood is spilled
shouldering the burden of ammunition and trust,
We feel no fear
even for a moment.
Fighting for the country
and fighting for the people,
we will keep on fighting
for as long as we live.
This film is dedicated to the Royal Malaysian Air Force
and soldiers who fought for their country. Thank you for your service and sacrifice.

Both of you are useless.
He hasn't paid rent for a few months.
Don't insult my dad.
My dad is a good man.
My dad is adequate.
This kid!
Kak Kiah.
What's wrong?
There's no need to hit my son.
He's still a child.
Stop talking.
Where is my rent money?
If you don't have the money…
you get out of here.
I will pay next week.
Get out!
Get out of here!
Liar!
You don't pay rent.
So many excuses.
Where are you?
Sherry…
Answer my call.
That's hot.
Just a second, Biko.
Here.
One for you.
Dad…
why didn't you argue with Aunt Kiah earlier?
She's so annoying.
Biko…
Aunt Kiah was so angry just now.
If a person is angry,
we should not argue with them.
If we argue with them, bad things will happen, you know.
What about our belongings?
It's okay. Don't worry.
I will deal with that later.
Aunt Kiah was angry because
I haven't paid rent.
We will take back our belongings once I pay the rent.
Do you have the money?
Sherry, where are you?
I am filming in JB.
What is it?
Never mind, when I see you later.
We'll talk.
All right, let's eat.
Say grace before meal.
In the name of God, The Most Gracious, The Most Merciful…
Amen.
Biko…
if you are not comfortable, let's just sleep in the back.
No, it's still early.
I can't sleep.
Dad,
by now we should have already moved into that house, right?
Be patient.
Uncle Raj is working on it.
You're lying.
I heard what you said to mummy earlier.
Uncle Raj took the money…
that was supposedly for the house purchase, right?
That's not true.
Uncle Raj just needs a little more time.
Dad,
why don't you hire Aunt Kiah.
Let her teach Uncle Raj a lesson.
So that he gives back your money.
All right. Don't worry.
I promise you…
we will stay in this house one day.
Okay?
Dad…
thank you.
You're welcome.
Go to sleep. You have school tomorrow, right?
Dad!
Enough!
I need to honk.
Otherwise, how will we be able to move forward?
It's okay, I will get off here.
Be careful.
He's so embarrassing.
Come to school on a rubbish truck.
Anyway, Isa, my family is going to Cameron Highlands after school ends.
That's why I brought this jacket.
It's so cold there, just like London.
Boss, please.
You just started working for one week ago.
You have asked for two weeks advance.
The thing is…
I was kicked out of my house last night.
What did you say to me that day?
You were cheated when buying a house.
And today you came with a sad face…
saying you were kicked out of your house?
-It's not what you think. -Enough.
This company won't give any advances to you anymore.
But that's okay.
Since you are my dearest worker…
I'll lend you my own money.
But you have to remember…
if you don't pay back my money at the end of this month…
I will charge interest like Along.
Do you want it? If you don't, I will keep it.
Thank you, boss.
Biko…
Luckily you didn't get run over just now.
Hurry. Why didn't you wait for me at the front?
You are ashamed because of the truck?
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
We're not stealing anything.
Dad…
where's my mom?
Here, I bought food for you.
Go ahead and eat.
Why are you always like this?
Whenever I ask about Mom…
you never give me an answer.
See…
I told you to eat but you refused.
Sulking.
And now you're hungry.
Serves you right.
No.
I am not hungry.
Biko…
I'm going to the washroom.
Here…
You can buy anything you want.
I'll place it here, okay?
Dad.
Have you bought your food?
Yes.
Dad…
I'm sorry.
Take out the coin box that I usually put in there.
Dad…
there's only 15 cents and a nut.
That belongs to your mother.
That time when I married your mom…
I had a rough time.
I had no money.
So I gave that nut to your mom.
You gave her this nut?
Dad…
is mom pretty?
Didn't you keep a picture of her?
It's all burnt.
I was not at home when it happened.
I was at work.
You're lucky that the neighbors saved you.
But your mom…
What happened to mom?
She was burnt to death?
Dad…
can we visit her grave?
Dad.
Dad, come help me catch those crabs.
It's so difficult.
-Come on. -Biko, come here.
Wear your mom's ring.
This is a nut, not a ring.
It doesn't matter if it's a nut or a ring.
This ring is a symbol of my love for Mom.
Who knows, this ring might bring you luck.
Isn't it nice to sleep under the stars every night?
It would be better if we could go Cameron Highlands.
Why do you want to go to Cameron Highlands?
My classmates have been there.
He said that place is very nice.
Cold like London.
Dad, let's go to Cameron Highlands.
You two sleep in this truck?
We are used to it.
How can you let your son sleep in the truck?
Sherry…
this truck is bigger than the previous house I lived in.
Biko.
Forgive me, God.
Biko, wake up.
The sun is up.
Be careful.
Oh, God.
Are you hurt?
-Enough. -Are you in pain?
Is it painful? All right, get up.
Mummy is here and you pretend to be in pain?
It hurts a little too, right?
Sit upright.
Why doesn't Biko stay with me?
Since your dad is going out of town.
No, I don't want to stay with girls.
I'm not an unfaithful Muslim.
You are really being theatrical.
Do you want to go to an audition? Just like before?
Yes!
I want to go, Dad.
You want to go?
Okay. But you need to listen to mummy.
Don't be naughty.
Don't ask for anything from mummy.
You're screwed otherwise.
Okay.
After you return, we'll go to Cameron Highlands.
My birthday. You promised.
Raj!
Where are you running to?
Wan, I didn't lie to you.
There's a tiny issue with your house.
When the issue is solved… I will find you.
If I believe you, I will never get the house.
Return my money.
Casting.
Stop.
Who let this kid in here?
Biko.
I'm sorry, Miss Sara.
It's okay.
Biko?
My dad always listens to this song.
Is that so?
So you came here to audition for my music video?
Yes, Miss Sara.
Okay, see you in a short while.
you are here too?
Are you eligible?
Hi, Biko.
See you shortly okay?
Is this the boy who brags about going to Cameron?
He's just disgusting to look at.
It's okay.
You just act normal.
Get ready, okay?
Ready.
What's that?
It's a ring.
My dad said it belonged to my late mom.
Is that so?
Biko…
What's that?
My mom's ring.
Where's your mom?
-Are you done? -Yes.
Let's eat.
Let's go.
It's cold, dad.
You said…
you wanted to celebrate your birthday at Cameron Highlands, right?
You have to endure it.
I can't.
I need to pee.
Me too.
So cold.
Here.
Wash your hands.
Good thing we didn't go to Cameron Highlands.
Or else we would be screwed.
Biko, how was your audition?
It's okay, Kak Sara said I have talent.
Kak Sara?
Yes, Kak Sara who sings…
Don't pretend to be single, dear
Biko…
what else did Kak Sara say to you?
She didn't say anything.
It's just that after she saw mom's ring…
she became frantic.
Frantic like you right now.
Dad!
Biko…
are you okay?
Biko.
Doctor, my son is okay, right?
Don't worry, he's okay.
How long has your arm felt numb like this?
It has been for a long time.
The numbness comes and goes.
But recently…
it's been more frequent.
Do you have insurance?
In that case…
I will prepare a referral letter for you.
To go to the specialist in a government hospital.
All right.
Thank you.
What did the doctor say?
Nothing.
Doctor asked Biko to rest.
I don't want Biko to go to the audition.
Actually I have been in KL for more than a week.
To plan and produce a music video from my latest album.
In conjunction with a concert I will be holding later this month.
Someone said you left Malaysia 10 years ago
because you failed in your relationship.
Of course all these are fake news on the Internet.
Why don't we take a break first?
Mr. Amir is so protective.
Mr. Amir not only is Miss Sara's manager…
but is her boyfriend as well?
Come on.
Regarding this contract, he pays…
I told you to park the truck here after you get off from work.
You came to me…
you pleaded with your sad face.
You said you were evicted from your rented place.
No place to stay.
You slept in the truck.
I'm so stupid to feel sorry for people like you.
You need to pay for the repair cost.
Yes, boss.
Boss…
what do I need to do in the meantime?
You're asking me what you need to do?
Go move the goods.
What's wrong?
All these are fragile goods.
There's a tiny issue with your house.
I'm sorry.
Enough.
You don't have to move the goods. Go get a broom and clean this up.
Sure.
Isn't that Sara Zulaika?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yes, boss.
That's her.
Let's talk outside.
How are you?
Fine.
I just met your son, Biko.
How do you know he's my son?
I have met your wife.
Wife?
Yes, Sherry.
Sherry said you didn't want Biko to get involved.
But this has nothing to do with us.
I've auditioned over 200 boys.
And I think only Biko is right one for this project.
And then I looked at his real name.
With that surname of yours.
I think…
maybe destiny wanted us to meet again.
Okay, Izwan, if it's about Biko's payment…
I will negotiate with my management team to increase the budget.
Is it true that the budget can be negotiated?
Yes.
I don't have any problems.
But with one condition.
You can't talk about our personal matters with Biko.
So you agree?
If you have any problems…
just talk to Sherry.
Thank you.
If there's nothing else, I'm going back to work.
Sherry…
I just spoke with Sara.
She insisted Biko be in her music video.
She is willing to increase the budget.
That's great.
At least it can cover some of the cost to repair the truck.
That's the thing.
But I had her agree to one condition.
Sherry, please help me to look after Biko.
I don't want him to be too close to Sara.
Why?
We do these things because of work. Because of money.
I don't want Biko to have anything to do with her.
One more thing, I don't want Biko to talk to her too much.
After filming ends, you bring Biko home straight away. Please?
Okay
Thank you.
Why oh why do you fall in love?
Although you belong to someone
You charm me
Dear, don't pretend to be single
Artist.
I like her.
I want to take a picture.
What's your problem?
Bro, what is this?
What's your problem?
You!
-Honey. -Listen here.
You can hate me.
He can hate me too if he wants.
But I won't let my daughter's life
be ruined by that uneducated foreman.
Understand?
Do you understand?
-Father. -Lock the door.
Father.
Mother.
Lock the door.
Mother.
Father. Please, Mother.
Help me.
Mother.
Are you okay?
I tried to call you but couldn't reach you.
Mother and Father locked me in here.
Just a second.
Step back. Sara, step back a little more.
Izwan.
Sara.
What happened?
Mother.
Aunty…
I'm sorry.
I really love Sara.
I promise you, I will take care of Sara.
Mother…
I love Izwan.
Please bless our relationship.
I understand.
Sara.
This is all I can give to you for now.
But I promise…
I will give you a diamond ring one day.
Marry me.
Come in.
Do you miss me?
Very much so.
Biko, come with me for makeup.
Then for a change of clothes.
This is the agreement from the other day.
His father has signed it.
Thank you.
I spoke to Izwan about increasing the budget.
So…
you can sign here, on behalf of Izwan.
I can't.
You are the parent. You can sign it.
No.
I'm not Biko's real mother.
Biko is like my son.
But we don't have any family ties.
So you and Izwan…
We've all settled, haven't we?
Yes, sorry. I'll talk to Izwan about this later.
Okay.
In that case I would like to see Biko.
Sherry.
What are you doing?
Cleaning the bean sprout.
I need a favor from you.
I'm going to Seremban tomorrow.
I can't bring Biko along.
Will you please take care of Biko?
But don't leave him with Sara.
Who is Sara to you, Izwan?
No one.
You will help me, right?
You think I don't have a job
other than to take care of Biko all the time?
I did all these things because I wanted to help you.
Do you know?
But if you're still hiding things from me…
what's the point of me doing all this?
Please.
I have something to do in Seremban.
I promise…
I will tell you when the time is right.
Hello, Director.
Where are you?
I am going to be a little late.
But I have told AD.
I want you back on set right now.
But, Director.
If you don't want to come back…
you don't have to come back forever. Do you understand?
Hello?
It's okay, mummy.
If you have things to do…
just go.
I will be okay.
Okay, but listen here.
You need to remember what your dad told you.
After work, don't talk or be close to Kak Sara.
-Understand? -Yes.
I am going to work. I will come back to pick you up later.
Miss Sara.
Biko.
Do you want it?
Let me buy it for you. Okay?
No.
My dad has promised to buy it for me.
Really?
Why don't you come over to my place and play?
-Okay, -Let's go.
Come on in.
Now let's go upstairs and look around.
-Okay? -Okay.
Kak, can I do something that I really wanted to do?
You always do this at home?
My house doesn't have a bed.
I just sleep in a truck.
Sleep in a truck?
It's nice to sleep in a truck.
Why don't you sleep here tonight?
My dad won't allow that.
Hello?
Hello, Dad?
Biko?
Where are you?
I'm at Kak Sara's home.
Why are you there?
Biko, where's mummy?
Mummy was busy just now.
Mummy has work to do.
Hello, Izwan.
Okay, you tell Biko to stay there.
Don't go anywhere.
I will come over to pick him up right now.
All right, Wan, I'll wait for you.
Can I?
Wan.
I'm busy now.
Why did you leave Biko with Sara?
I had to.
The director was throwing a fit just now.
Why didn't you tell me first?
I can't rely on you!
Watch your mouth if you want to throw a fit.
I have called Biko.
And Sara also knew.
What is your problem now?
The problem is, I have a problem with that.
You didn't tell me what the problem is.
So I'm asking you now, who is Sara to you?
Enough. I don't have time to answer all this.
I have an incoming call.
-Yes, boss? -Hello, Izwan.
I need you to go to Terengganu.
Terengganu?
There's an urgent delivery.
When?
I need you to be there tonight.
Kak Sara, this water tastes fresh.
Let's eat.
Biko.
Kak Sara…
is this real western food?
Yes. Why?
Dad lied to me.
He said Western food only has eggs and hotdogs.
Biko…
where's your mother?
Sorry, I can't tell you.
-Why? -Mummy told me not to talk about it.
So…
you have never met your mother?
Sorry.
I can't talk about that either.
In that case, let's talk about mummy. Yes?
I just want to ask one thing.
Mummy likes your dad, right?
Kak Sara…
but my dad likes you.
He listens to your song every day.
That's all I can tell you.
Wan, are you here yet?
Not yet. I'm still on the highway.
I need to go to Terengganu.
I will only be back tomorrow.
Are you still coming?
Wan, why don't you come tomorrow?
Furthermore, Biko is asleep.
It's hard for you to turn back, right?
And you want to let Biko sleep in the truck?
I can trust you, right?
What do you mean?
You can't tell or bring up anything about us to Biko.
Right now I only have Biko in this world.
No one else.
Don't worry.
Later, when Biko wakes up,
I will ask him to call you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
D0ra.ling
I have brought you nasi lemak. Eat it.
Nasi lemak again?
You can have it.
I am full.
Even if you don't want to eat, please think about our child.
Do you even know,
this month alone, how many times have we had nasi lemak?
26 times.
If you're really thinking about our child,
you won't keep buying nasi lemak for me.
So picky.
Just eat.
I've already bought it.
You are so hard to please.
Calm down. Okay?
Whoever reaches the finish line first…
will be the winner
But in this race we have rules.
The rules are…
there are no rules at all.
On the count of three.
Two.
One.
Darling…
let's eat.
I have bought lots of food.
I have bought a variety of food.
You are still racing, right?
No.
You still want to lie to me?
Have you ever thought of this?
If anything happens to you…
what will happen to our child and me?
Darling…
I'm sorry. All right?
I promise I won't race again.
I swear.
Enough.
Don't mess with vows.
And don't you just simply throw away this ring.
This ring means a lot.
Between me and you.
I'm just worried.
I won't do it again.
Smile.
Wan.
Jie, my boss is here. You have to leave.
He will make a scene.
Calm down.
I have something good to share with you.
I refuse if it's about racing.
I don't want to have anything to do with races.
Just leave.
This is not about racing. This is another thing.
I will give you 5,000.
You just have to be a dummy.
You only need to lose in the race.
After that, you can do whatever you want.
I'm giving you 1,000 advance.
Tonight I will give you the balance.
I've told you a few times.
I don't want this worm in my shop.
You just simply call people worm.
Who's a worm?
You!
You get out!
You get out too!
Boss, why me?
Let's go.
Wan.
Jie…
That's the gang who puts in the bet for me to win?
You don't need to know that.
The important thing is for you do your job.
Sara.
Where's Izwan?
What is this?
If you have a problem, let's talk outside.
I don't come here to talk.
Unless you pay the 15,000 we lost in the race last night.
Where's my money?
You promised me!
Enough.
I came here not to watch your drama for lying to your wife.
I want my money.
Where's my money?
I don't have money.
No money.
Let's go.
Darling!
Eight.
Boss…
thank you.
Use the money well.
Don't ask for an advance again.
Wan, come in.
Dad.
Biko.
Let me take you for a tour of the house.
It's big.
Is it?
Biko.
Here.
I have brought a surprise for you.
Come and look at what Kak Sara bought for me.
Dad, hurry.
Hurry, Dad.
Look.
Someone's there.
No, game over.
Dad.
Biko.
Bring your dad down for food.
Come on, Dad.
We'll have real western food.
Not the hotdog we usually have.
Come on, Dad. Hurry.
I'm full.
I want to play video game for a while.
Wan, let him be.
Actually I have a few things to ask you.
What is it?
Is Biko misbehaving?
No, Biko is a good kid.
I am wondering…
who is Biko's mother?
You don't need to know all that.
If I'm Biko's mother…
I think I deserve to know.
You're not his mother.
Izwan.
I don't blame you.
You don't have the right to blame me or anyone else.
If Biko is my son…
I have rights over him.
Your rights have been long gone.
After you left us.
Biko.
-Yes? -Come here.
-What's wrong? -Let's go.
What happened?
-Izwan. -Don't try to stop me!
I haven't packed my things yet.
No need to take away any stuff from this house.
But those are my stuff.
Izwan, please.
Move.
You want to stay here so much?
You want to stay with this woman, right?
You can stay here forever.
Don't you acknowledge me as your father again.
Dad.
Go away!
Dad.
I don't have an ungrateful son like you!
Dad.
Dad
What is so important that you had to see me, Miss Sara?
Sherry.
Where are Izwan and Biko?
I don't know.
Maybe they are out of town.
Why are you mad at me?
What did I do wrong?
What did you do wrong?
Do you know…
how hard Izwan and Biko's lives have been all this time?
You dumped your child and acted like nothing's wrong.
And now you want to be acknowledged as his mother?
All of that is not true.
Sherry.
You don't know what really happened.
And I think Izwan doesn't know either.
-Mother, Father. -Honey, enough.
Father.
Please mind Sara.
Mother.
I'm so sorry.
You…
Do you remember what you promised me?
Mother, please mind Sara.
Has Sara regained consciousness?
Please, Izwan.
Sara requested this many times.
She doesn't want to see you.
Sara.
I'm sorry.
Where's my child?
Mother.
Father.
That child could not be saved.
Your child…
has passed away.
Sara said you shouldn't be surprised.
She has told you this.
She is going to leave you if you break your promise.
Sis…
I understand, but the child…
Okay, here's the deal.
I'll arrange for you to take the child and leave.
Sara doesn't want the child.
She just asked me to dump the child.
She wants to start a new life in Indonesia.
So starting today…
Sara and our family don't want anything to do with you.
You have ruined her life.
Isn't it enough that she suffered because of you?
Take back this ring.
She asked me to return it to you.
I regretted it, mother.
I regretted it.
Sara.
I love you, sweetie.
I'm the one to be blamed.
I couldn't stop you.
I couldn't protect you.
Father.
It's my own fault.
I disobeyed you.
I was rebellious.
And now I have faced the consequences.
I regretted it.
I shouldn't have married Izwan.
I regretted it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Izwan.
From the report we received, you suffer from ALS.
What's that, doctor?
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
It's a disturbance to the nervous system that attacks the brain cells.
You will have muscle movement problems.
And sometimes you will feel pain suddenly.
Mr. Izwan,
you will start to find it difficult to swallow food, and maybe…
you will have difficulty speaking.
Look.
Biko.
Why are you playing with this?
You can't play with this.
Have you cleaned up the back of the truck?
What did I tell you to do?
Go clean up now.
Go clean up now
You're not allowed to eat until you finish cleaning.
Sherry.
Why do I feel like you are trying to avoid me?
You don't want to talk to me.
What's your problem?
Are you mad at me?
I met Sara, Wan.
I think…
you both have a misunderstanding.
Sara didn't know she has a child.
Her mother and father told her that her child had died…
during labor.
I think…
you should go and meet her.
If you are suffering all this while…
try imagining being in her place.
She doesn't know the real story.
God.
Why are you only telling me now?
I am in a dilemma.
You…
Will you reconcile with her after this?
Dad.
I have finished cleaning the truck.
I am hungry.
What's wrong with dad?
Dad…
you said you didn't want to see Kak Sara again.
Why do you suddenly want to meet her?
Biko.
So many questions.
Biko, why are you taking me to this place?
Of course.
Kak Sara likes places like this.
Enough, come on.
-Hi, Kak Sara. -Hi, Biko.
I need to go to the washroom.
What's wrong?
I think he wants to count his money.
He is afraid that he doesn't have enough money to treat you.
It's okay.
You go look for your dad.
Tell him I'll pay for this.
We celebrate the wrap of our MV shoot.
Amir.
Dad.
What's taking you so long?
It's okay, don't worry.
Kak Sara said she will treat us tonight.
To celebrate the wrap of her MV shoot.
Come on, Dad.
There are many sponsors waiting for you at home.
But you chose to be here?
Right.
-I forgot. -Really?
You forgot?
I know that kid is cute.
But you aren't supposed to be here.
Your music video is done.
Your work with that boy is done.
You have to be at home entertaining the sponsors,
not entertaining this kid.
My life, my choice.
Fine. You can do what you want with your life.
But the problem is, this is your career.
Who I choose to meet,
I don't need you to make all those decisions for me.
Try to recall.
Recall how hard we worked to reach this stage.
So?
I haven't been working all this while?
How many hours do I sleep every day?
Your career is gaining momentum right now.
You need to know this.
You are the one who needs to know, I never complain about anything.
This is not about you complaining.
You're supposed to settle the matter about entertaining sponsors.
But you put all those responsibilities--
I'm not Sara.
You are Sara.
I bring sponsors. I bring you to meet them.
You need to do the work.
You need to entertain them, not me.
-So if you don't understand-- -Okay, fine, I understand.
That kid.
That kid, Biko,
will ruin your career.
He is not just any kid.
Well, so who is he? God?
An angel come from heaven?
Watch your mouth!
I don't understand why that darn boy--
Biko is my son!
And who is he?
This is my dad.
Now I know why you insisted on this boy.
And you, brother.
Where were you when she was having a hard time?
She had her ups and downs with me.
I'm the one who took care of her.
I built her name.
I built her career.
And now she is rich, you bring this boy,
ask her to take care of him, let go of your responsibilities?
What do you think she is?
-A money-making machine? -Enough, Amir.
Biko.
Dad.
Why did Kak Sara say that I'm her son?
Kak Sara is really my mother, right?
Why did you lie to me?
Why did you say my mother was burnt to death?
Do you know?
I really wanted to have a mom.
You are really hopeless.
You are a liar.
Biko.
What's wrong?
Dad lied to me.
My mother is still alive.
Is it true that Kak Sara…
You want to go there, right?
Sherry.
Take him to his mother.
But remember this.
Don't ever come back here.
Don't ever come back to me again.
-Izwan. -He's grown up, right?
He's on his own. Let him go.
Go!
Is it true that…
you are my mother?
That's right, Biko.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I didn't know.
I swear I didn't know about you.
If not, I wouldn't have left you.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I… Seriously I want to apologize about…
Yes. This is for you.
These are the talking points for the PC tonight.
Amir, I am thinking…
I know you want to tell the whole world that Biko is your son.
But please, I beg you.
Not now.
Okay, if you don't want me to tell now…
I'll tell everything during the concert.
Come, Biko.
What's your name?
So cute.
I could pinch those cheeks.
So cute.
Are you staying with Kak Sara now?
Not Kak Sara…
but my mom.
What's wrong?
You need to get used to this kind of life.
Maybe once a month…
once a week, or every night.
And you need to get used to calling her Kak Sara, not "Mom".
Why is that?
Kak Sara has a career.
And she depends on her fans.
They won't like it if she has a son.
That would upset her life.
You want to upset her life?
Why didn't you stay with your dad?
Don't you feel sorry that you left your dad alone?
I want to go back to my room.
-Biko. -Hello, Dad.
I'm sorry.
What's wrong?
Please come and pick me up now.
I can't.
I'm working.
Mummy is working too.
Please get your mom.
Mom is not here.
You don't love me anymore?
I'll be waiting for you.
Please come now.
Please, Dad.
Doctor…
is there any cure for this illness?
For now, there is no medicine or cure for ALS.
I can't.
Just stay there, okay?
Listen to your mom.
Dad, please.
I have work to do.
It's important.
Here's the deal.
Later…
I'll come and look for you.
Okay?
You are lying.
I hate you.
I swear.
I didn't lie to you.
You can see the contract for yourself.
I might have had a little problem before.
But my problem is solved now.
I heard that you used my money to pay back the Along.
It's all a misunderstanding.
What's important is that this house is yours now.
Right now you just have to pay…
the remaining lawyer fees of 7,000 ringgit.
And then you and your son can enter the house.
Where's Biko?
He said he was sleepy.
I told David to send him upstairs.
Yes, Izwan?
Are you still busy?
I have guests. What is it?
I know your concert is important.
But if you want to take care of Biko…
there's one thing you need to know.
He is the most important thing.
Why are you saying these things all of a sudden?
Biko just called me.
He cried, asking to come back to me.
Right now, I don't want him to come back to me.
I know you are rich now.
You have succeeded.
But that's not all that Biko wants.
He doesn't want your money nor your gifts.
He just wants attention from you.
Please check on him.
Sweetie.
What is it?
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I promise.
After the concert…
I'll spend all of my time with you.
And that time…
we both will go see your dad.
We'll go out and have dinner together.
Just like what you did with your dad before.
That's what you told me, right?
Hurry up. He will be pissed off.
Izwan?
What are you doing here?
Nothing. I just happened to be around.
How is Biko with his mom? Okay?
He's okay.
That's good. I also feel sorry. I have been busy.
There is no chance at all to go see him.
It's okay.
Are you okay?
You look like you're stressed.
I just got back from the lawyer.
You know that house I bought for Biko?
-It's settled. -Okay.
But right now I need…
7,000 ringgit for me to get the keys.
And then I can enter the house.
7,000 ringgit?
Where are you going to find the money?
What if…
you borrow from Biko's mom?
Nothing wrong with that.
I'm reluctant to do so.
After all, I have never bought anything for Biko all this time.
And if I can, I don't want to involve anyone.
Especially Sara.
It's enough that I've been insulted all this time.
-Don't-- -Sherry.
Where's the motorcycle stuntman?
Have you found him yet?
Just a second.
"Just a second."
What time is it now?
I want to start shooting in a moment.
The clock is ticking.
Bro…
I can do it.
Wan.
Are you sure you want to do this?
You need to ride up the ramp.
and leap over that house, which will explode afterwards.
Sherry.
I can do this.
Believe me.
But--
Sherry.
Is he ready?
Hurry up.
Bro.
Welcome, everyone.
Thank you for coming
and sharing feelings with me today.
If you have all watched the music video just now…
of course you would already know…
this cute little one named Biko.
And before I continue my concert today…
I want to clarify all the news.
You all may have heard about me and Biko.
Biko is actually not just a model for my music video…
but also…
my real son.
Biko.
And now you bring this boy,
ask her to take care of him, let go of your responsibilities?
What do you think she is? A money-making machine?
Is there any cure for this illness?
For now…
there is no medicine or cure for ALS.
Right now, you just have to pay…
the remaining lawyer fees of 7,000 ringgit.
And then you and your son can enter the house.
Izwan!
Izwan
Stop! Izwan!
Sara dear, where are you going?
Izwan had an accident.
Dad?
Dad had an accident?
Yes, Biko.
I need to leave now.
No, wait.
You need to stay here.
We have a contract with the sponsors.
But--
Here's the deal.
I'll make sure Biko meets his father.
I will send him there personally.
Now you go up on stage and perform.
For yourself.
For Biko.
You go first, sweetie.
I will be there later.
Come on, Biko.
Beautiful moments of our love
Has become history
My smile buries the wound
Save our love
After all this time
I accept the reality
Sometimes I regret
Our separation
I feel the love from you
Imagining you are by my side
Our memories will never be forgotten
Forever
Still feeling the love from you
Although our love suffers
Pinning you in my heart
Forever
Biko.
Izwan.
Biko is here.
Biko.
How did this happen?
I'm okay.
Where's your mom?
Mom is not here yet.
Dad.
I want to sleep in the truck with you.
I want to see the stars with you.
Don't leave me.
Biko.
I want to apologize to you.
This is all my fault.
I shouldn't have let your dad do this.
Izwan.
Forgive me.
Izwan.
Sherry.
You did nothing wrong.
Actually I…
suffer from ALS.
I won't live much longer.
I kept all this a secret…
because I don't want you to be sad.
You've sacrificed a lot…
for me.
And for Biko.
I want to apologize to you.
I knew…
you had feelings for me for a long time.
I can feel it all, Sherry.
Biko.
Dad.
My money is enough now.
Later you bring mummy…
and your mom…
to see our new house.
I want us to go together.
The ring.
What ring is that?
That diamond ring…
Biko.
You need to give to your mom.
Izwan?
Dad.
Izwan?
Izwan.
-Dad? -Izwan.
I feel the love from you
Imagining you are by my side
Our memories will never be forgotten
Forever
Still feeling the love from you
Although our love suffers
Pinning you in my heart
And there's no Wi-Fi either.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Hey, this isn't funny.
Help! Help!
Get ready!
One, two, three.
Is it deep?
Hey, it's just sand, there are no rocks.
Is it cold?
Cold, cold, cold.
You're so timid. Can you be braver next time?
Moron! Come here.
Okay.
Scared, huh? Scared
Hey, sorry, sorry.
Hey!
My god, are you blind?
It's your fault.
Why leave things in the middle?
Luckily it didn't get too far.
Oh, is it my fault now? Clean it up right now.
You're so stern.
Why would anyone want to get engaged to you?
-Take this. -Okay, okay, okay.
Look at that cousin of yours.
She thinks I am bad at repairing cars. I am good at it!
You pushed me just now?
Sir, we lost the GPS signal.
Do I go straight?
Yes, just follow the road.
Yes, sir.
Where exactly is this college?
And aren't the students on their semester break?
Do you teach there?
Yes.
Adli, Mom's calling. Adli.
Boboi!
Hey, don't you have another name?
That's the name of my cat back at home.
You don't want to answer Mum's call here.
While at home, you cling to Mom all the time.
Alia, why did you call me Boboi?
I called your name because you didn't respond. Mom's calling.
I'll return her call later.
What's there to call? There's no coverage at the hostel.
Alia, there's Wi-Fi at the hostel.
Gang!
Let's pray before we head back.
I'll pray later at the hostel.
Liar.
Hey!
Assalamualaikum, Mom.
Yes, Adli's here.
He's bathing at the river.
I just thought of bringing him and his friends to play by the river.
Don't worry, Mom.
I'll look after him. Kak Fiza is here too.
Okay, Mom.
Bye!
I'm not ready.
Stop taking my picture.
They won't turn out good!
You don't have to be ready. You always look good.
Okay no, no, one more time!
Okay, one more!
One!
Two!
Three!
Look!
Isn't it nice?
Yes, it's nice.
Kak Yam, what are you doing here?
Delivering food supplies.
Otherwise, what will the kids who didn't go home eat?
They're all grown up.
They can take care of themselves.
Hey! Farid.
Did you hear?
Hear what?
About the village right behind.
Last week there was a fuss. Some villagers got possessed.
The Silat boys got possessed!
There were seven of them.
Those Silat guys always go overboard.
-They were too engrossed. -Hey, I'm serious here!
Their eyes turned all black.
Their sclerae disappeared.
Their faces turned pale!
Perhaps due to drugs.
No!
Enough. I have to deliver food to the canteen.
Okay, Kak.
In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.
Oh Allah, oh my God, please forgive our sins.
The sins of our parents, the sins of our teachers.
Protect us from calamities.
I beg you, oh Allah.
Please extend the lives of our parents.
Please extend the lives of our teachers.
Forgive our sins and distance us from adultery.
And all kinds of sins, little or great.
Ya Allah.
Answer me, oh, God.
Hurry up!
Adli, the smoke has to go further that way!
Be patient! If you want it fast, cook it yourself.
No, the problem now is
I asked you guys to pray, but you guys lied!
That's right!
Great.
This is lying.
Hey, seriously, is the chicken enough?
I don't think it's enough.
Done.
Eating alone, huh?
I asleep from waiting so long.
How could you do this to me?
Blame them for late!
I cooked it myself.
Here, it's all done for you. I'm sorry.
Adli, you too. Why you didn't learn to cook properly?
Sorry, Kak Fiza.
Now you're scared!
Hey, hey, where's Wari?
Wari.
I saw him over there just now.
-Wari. -Huh?
Wari.
Wari!
Wari.
Are you done?
Yes.
Tomorrow morning I'll come at 5:00.
Don't you forget to wake up.
Don't worry, I'm a professional.
Teacher?
Kak Yam.
-Is Warden Harris around? -Yes, teacher.
In the office, probably.
What happened to his hand?
He got into an accident!
He's still on leave, isn't he?
All right. I'll make my move.
Stay safe, Kak.
Come in.
Nazmi!
Have a seat.
Sorry.
I had to ask you come work early today.
It's all right.
There's nothing left for me at home.
Don't say such things, Mi.
Allah is testing you because
He loves you.
There must be a reason behind it.
Right.
A reason
which I couldn't find.
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
There.
How's your arm?
It looks bad.
No.
Broken.
Hey. Here.
List of students who will stay here tonight.
Only 27 of them?
This is what I managed to get.
Hey!
Sorry again.
If it wasn't for the emergency I wouldn't have called.
No worries.
I really wanted to work.
This is the key to the warden's room. Stay there.
I only left few things there.
-Just my clothes. -Okay.
One more thing.
For tonight's maghrib prayers you'll be the imam.
Ask someone else to do it.
Hey, hurry up.
I want to go home.
Let's go, let's go.
Quick!
Quit messing around, I want to go home.
Now, okay.
-I'm going back. -Okay, boss.
Now the gate is closed.
We're done for.
Relax, Sam.
It's just a gate.
Then how are you guys going in?
How about this, Kak?
We'll go back to the main road.
Drive us to the back.
Okay?
This is too much.
Kak. Stop, Kak.
-Here? -Yes, here.
Hey, get on out.
Get on out?
Where to?
Sam, you're such a nerd.
I asked you to hang out but you didn't want to.
Let's go.
Hey.
You'll heading back to KL?
No, the day after tomorrow.
Kak Miza has to meet the caterer tomorrow.
Do you have some money, Alia?
Now he's asking for money.
Where's your own money?
Kak, I've finished my money from PTPTN.
Did you spend it or did you waste it?
Of course I spent it, what else could it be?
Here.
Thanks, Alia.
Oh dear. Your brother is such a spoiled kid.
Kak, why are you being jealous?
Hey, when you guys are back in KL,
Give my regards to our parents and all.
-If God wills. -Take care of yourself.
Take care, Kak.
Bye.
Bye, Boboi.
Hey, Wari.
What about the photos?
I'll email them later.
Send only the nice ones. Otherwise, I don't want it.
Any photo with you in it is nice.
Go, they'll leave you behind.
Bye, Alia. Bye, Kak.
Bye.
All right, let's go.
I like Wari.
He's a sweet guy.
Hey,
What?
You like my sister, don't you?
What are you talking about?
Don't lie to me.
Even if I do like her, what's your problem?
Big problem.
You would be my brother-in-law out of nowhere, you know.
Bullshit.
Just open up.
Adli, help carry my bag.
Okay.
Right now.
We'll go past the teachers' office.
Wait.
Why don't we just walk along the new block?
You're so dense.
Aren't we on semester break now?
The teachers have gone home.
Hey.
Hurry up.
Wari.
Wari.
Wari.
Hey.
-Are you okay? -Okay.
Let's go.
Hey, one second.
Okay, let's go. It's nothing!
Just a prank.
How dare you prank me?
-Prank! -One,
two, three, run!
Why are you guys leaving me behind?
Gang.
Whoever's the last is a monkey!
Sam is a monkey!
So, who's the monkey?
Sam.
He already looks like one.
Where are you coming from?
We came from…
We came from the surau.
Just finished prayers.
That's true, we came from the surau.
The student who was the imam took attendance.
Your names weren't on it.
Maybe because there were too many of us.
He didn't notice us.
Many, huh?
Only seven people prayed at the surau.
Whose is this?
It's not ours, teacher.
Maybe belongs to someone else.
What other students?
They've all gone home.
You guys are the only ones here.
I don't know, teacher.
All I know is I don't smoke.
Neither do I.
Follow me.
See, I told you guys…
You guys are stubborn.
Ouch.
What's your problem?
Playing the blame game now?
You want to save yourself?
Chill, I got punished too, right?
Hey, gang.
Isn't Teacher Nazmi on a long break? Why is he here working?
I saw his arm. Did you notice there was a cast on it?
An accident?
Hey.
Forget about him. Why bother meddling in other people's business?
Let's do our job.
Come on.
Wari.
Are you okay?
Okay.
I thought you had a fever.
Hey.
Clean this up, you guys.
You think I'm paying you guys for nothing?
Listen here.
I…
left a gift for you guys In the toilet.
The flush didn't work.
-What are you waiting for? -Pick it up.
I ain't picking it up.
You.
Don't play with soap, okay?
Why are you laughing? As if you have never played with it.
What soap do you use?
This one.
I'm done.
There's no Internet.
Blackout.
How to update my vlog?
-Wait. -What?
Oh, no, my phone is running out of battery.
Same here, my phone is dying out too.
I don't have coverage either.
How am I supposed to call my mom now?
Serves you right. You disobeyed Alia.
Good for you. Suit with your name, Boboi.
You…
Hey.
Teacher isn't around, is he? Let's leave.
Hey. Don't do that.
If teacher found out.
We would be done for.
Let's finish this. Just a bit more.
-Come on. -You're playing rough.
Wari. Wari. Wari.
Wari!
Hey. Wari, are you okay? Do you want some medicine?
I'm not feeling well.
Bring him to the dorm, let him have some rest.
Let's go.
Get in.
Faster, get in.
Lie down.
Oh my!
It feels so hot.
Why is he so feverish?
-It's really hot. -Hot.
I don't know what to do now.
Okay, never mind.
I'll go get some medicine from teacher.
You guys take care of him.
Okay.
Get some rest, Wari.
Hurry, Adli.
Wari.
What's wrong with you? You became so sick.
No idea. Could it be food poisoning?
It couldn't be.
Didn't we all eat the same thing?
Teacher.
You gave me a shock.
What's the matter?
Got notice about power outage?
No, there wasn't.
Probably a blown fuse due to lightning.
Even if we call the technician they would only arrive tomorrow.
I personally don't mind.
I'm worried the students might escape.
Don't worry.
I'll help keep an eye later.
Hey.
Teacher.
Didn't I ask you to clean the washroom?
No, teacher, I came looking for you, teacher.
Wari has a fever. I'm here for some medicine.
Stop lying.
I swear, teacher, Wari is sick. I'm not lying.
Where's he?
At the dorm.
Wari.
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
What happened?
Wari.
Wari.
Wari!
Wari!
Nik.
Nik.
Nik.
Nik.
Nik.
Wake up, Nik.
Hey., Nik!
Nik.
Place him over there.
Tell me what happened.
Actually, teacher.
While cleaning the washroom, Wari suddenly had a fever.
We brought him back to the dorm.
When we reached the dorm, he became weird, teacher.
His eyes.
His face.
I don't know how to put it, teacher.
What did your friend do to become like this?
I don't know, teacher.
No idea.
Whose phone has got coverage?
I have a phone, teacher.
But there's no coverage here.
Go to new block to get coverage.
Even with that.
We can only get one bar.
We need to go there.
teacher.
What about Wari?
You are all my responsibility.
Let's deal with the phone first.
Look after him.
Why do we have to stay here?
We have to look after, Nik.
What if Wari comes?
What are you going to do?
Just let teacher handle everything.
This dorm right here?
Go get coverage.
Once you've made the call, go to the warden's room.
Okay, teacher.
The students are still awake.
Where is the coverage?
What's going on?
Why are you still awake?
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Hey.
What's wrong with you?
Hey, are you okay?
Teacher! Help, teacher!
Teacher!
What are you doing?
Open door for him.
You moron! It could be Wari!
You're the moron. Wari doesn't sound like that.
Teacher!
What if he's pretending, Kechik?
Don't dig your own grave!
What then?
Just ignore him?
Teacher, help!
Food has been dealt with.
I only have one problem left.
Flowers.
Do you want roses or lilies, Alia?
Alia.
Hello, Alia.
What's wrong?
I have a bad feeling.
Adli?
Alia. Alia.
Alia, you've to get back here now.
Hello, Adli.
Alia. Alia, we're in danger.
You need to get back here, please.
Hello.
I can't hear you.
Alia, listen here.
Wari is sick.
Get back here right now!
Adli, what gibberish are you talking?
Alia.
Alia, please.
We're in danger, you have to come.
Danger?
What sort of danger?
Hello.
Alia. Alia.
Adli.
Hello.
Wari.
Wari.
I couldn't get through.
Kak Fiza.
I feel that something's wrong.
What exactly is wrong?
Because Adli said Wari fell sick.
He was just talking nonsense.
But that's what Adli said.
Okay, so? What?
Whatever Adli says, you just believe?
He was just pulling your leg.
No.
I know Adli.
I know what he's like when lie, or when he is serious.
Kak Fiza.
I think Adli is in danger.
We need to turn back right now.
It's me.
Adli.
Hey.
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
Are you okay?
Wari.
Wari changed.
I saw his face.
I don't know how to describe this.
I stabbed him.
Is he dead?
I'm not sure.
Where's teacher Nazmi?
He isn't back yet?
No.
We split up earlier.
He went to look around.
At the seniors' block.
Nik.
Nik.
Where are we?
What happened?
Are you okay?
I don't know.
My head is pounding like a drum.
I feel dizzy.
We've to get Nik to the hospital.
Where's Wari?
Adli.
Did you call the ambulance?
I couldn't. My cellphone broke.
Then who's coming to save us?
But I was able to call Alia.
Let's wait here.
Maybe she'll arrive in a while.
Teacher.
Teacher.
What happened?
I was attacked.
By a student.
His face!
His face…
Kak Yam…
Kak Yam told me the nearby village been possesed.
Possessed?
Possessed.
What do we do, teacher?
There are students in my room.
Let's meet up with them.
And we'll make a plan.
I thought of the students who went hysterical.
The hysteria must have spread in some way.
How does it spread then?
I don't know.
But I don't think it spreads through air or infection.
Because we wrestled with Wari earlier, but nothing happened.
Wari bit you just now, didn't he?
How could it spread through biting?
Sir!
Sir!
Where is the guard?
Why is the dorm pitch black?
I was right.
Adli called because something went wrong.
Kak Fiza, we must get inside.
Okay let's go.
Wait.
Does she have the key?
How is your sister going to enter here?
You're right.
It isn't that difficult. Just open it.
Where's the key?
Usually, the guard
puts it in the booth.
I think we've to open the gate now.
But isn't it dangerous out there?
It's okay, Sam, I can go alone.
Never mind, I will follow you.
Nik,
look after Sam.
Let's go.
Give me your phone.
My battery is low.
It's fine.
Let's go.
Look, there are lights!
Do you think it's Farid or…
It's okay, Kechik.
We'll go have a look.
Let's go.
Chik, Chik! Wait.
Do you see them?
No.
Adli.
Hey, are you okay?
Kechik.
I think I can't go back with you guys.
What are you talking about?
We're going back to the warden's room now and we'll treat you.
You know, don't you…
what will happen to me?
Adli. Come in, come in.
Kechik.
Once my sister arrives…
you take Nik to the hospital.
What about you?
Adli!
Hey, hey!
Adli! Adli!
Close the door!
Teacher.
Did you ask for anyone's help?
Earlier I asked the students to call for help.
How long does the power outage last usually?
I don't know.
There must be something that we can do.
This place used to be powered by a generator.
It's still there. But I don't know if it is still working.
We have to try starting the generator.
How? I don't know how. I'm not good at it.
Kak Fiza!
Blood.
Kak Fiza, look.
There's someone over there.
Hey, kid.
Hey, kid.
We're looking for a student here.
His name is Adli. Do you know him?
Who's that, Kak Fiza?
-Kak Fiza! -Alia! Alia! Alia!
Run, Alia! Go!
Alia!
Alia! Wake up! Wake up! Alia!
Alia!
Run!
Run Alia!
Run! Run!
Alia! Alia!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Teacher.
Teacher! Let's go!
My bag! My bag! My bag! My bag!
What are you doing?
Run! Alia!
Hey!
Who are you people?
I…
am the sister of a student here, Adli.
He called for help just now.
Do you know him?
Yes.
He is already at the warden's room.
Wait! Wait!
What was wrong with that student just now?
Why?
We have no idea either.
But right now we've to go back to the warden's room.
Let's go.
Hey, hurry up! Faster! Faster!
Alia.
Where's Kechik? He couldn't have left me behind, could he?
Relax, Sam.
You make me depressed.
Teacher.
Kak Fiza! Alia!
Sam?
Where's Adli?
Adli and Kechik went to open the gate.
You didn't see them?
Hey, the gate key is with me.
Who's that?
Alia! Kak Fiza!
Kechik!
Where's Adli?
I asked where's Adli?
Tell us.
Tell us what happen.
Adli became just like Wari.
No!
Adli!
Alia. Alia. Look at Kak Fiza.
Didn't I tell you and Adli not to leave the room?
Stubborn. Look what happened to Adli.
-You moron! -Can you just shut up?
Shut up?
What I said is true.
-If he were careful… -You're wrong!
Adli is our friend. Be considerate of their feelings!
Earlier you saw a student asking for help. Why didn't you help?
I had to ensure, Nik's safety.
Was it his safety or your safety that you wanted to ensure?
Cut it out!
Fiza, where did you park?
I parked at the place where I dropped you guys earlier.
Can we all fit in your van?
The key is in the bag.
Bag?
We've to get it from the student at the football field.
Does anyone have a phone?
There's no coverage.
No coverage in this area.
So there's no internet either.
Go to a higher place.
What do we do now?
We need to learn about the things out there.
They're savage, teacher.
I saw it with my own eyes.
When they were gathering at the field.
I think Wari is their leader.
They can seemingly communicate with each other.
One more thing.
Their eyes.
They can't look at light.
Are you sure about the generator?
I'm sure!
But I don't know if it is still working.
Wait. There's a generator?
Yes.
Show it to me. Perhaps I can fix it.
Do we have a toolbox and petrol?
Yes, we do.
At the workshop.
-Let's go!! -Wait.
Let's split up.
Farid, bring Fiza to the generator.
Sam.
You and Kechik…
head to the workshop.
Look for some petrol,
take the toolbox and meet up with them at the generator.
Teacher.
Hey, wait.
Is it okay to split up?
It will be easier for them to spot us if we move in a big group.
Okay.
Cellhone.
What do you want to do?
I've to go get coverage at the upper floor.
I want to tag along. I can help.
No way.
You have to stay here.
But this is my phone. I want to tag along.
Nik.
As long as it isn't done, don't go out, you got it?
Wari.
I am sorry, Wari.
I am sorry.
I'm so glad you are still alive, Wari.
Don't worry, Adli, I'm fine.
Wari.
But I am in pain, Wari.
I'll bring you to a world without suffering.
Close your eyes, Adli.
Trust me.
Follow me, Adli.
Hurry. We're almost there.
There, the generator shed.
Let's go.
Here! Here!
Let's go.
Come on! Come on!
Go! Go! Go!
Take this.
Faster.
Whiere is the key?
It's stuck! It's stuck!
Go inside
Come inside
You…
How is it going? Can you fix it?
Probably yes.
I learnt about this model back then.
Anyway we have to wait for Kechik.
All right.
You!
Here.
What's this?
I'll wait for Kechik.
Whatever happens, don't go out.
Sam! Take this.
Sam!
Sam!
Sam!
Let's go!
Here.
Nik! Open the door, Nik!
Nik!
Sam! What's the matter?
Where's Kechik?
Kechik died.
Are you serious? Don't joke around with me.
It's true, Nik. I saw it with my own eyes.
He was trapped at the workshop.
I think that right now we need to go to the secret entrance.
We've to get Kak Fiza's van.
Didn't they lose their keys at the field?
What do we do now?
We need to leave this place, Nik
We need to go to the highway.
Let's get to main road.
We must get help, Nik.
What about Teacher Nazmi, Alia, Kak Fiza? Is that all?
We must get out of here, Nik.
Otherwise we will all die here, Nik.
Please, Nik. Let's get out, Nik.
Let's escape from here, Nik.
Handphone
Got a signal?
Adli
Adli.
Hey!
Are you all right?
Adli,
Teacher!
Adli. Adli, don't!
Adli!, don't! Adli!
Adli.
Alia's here.
It's me, Alia! Adli!
Alia! Alia!
-Alia! -Alia?
Alia!
Adli!
Alia!
Adli! Adli! Adli!
Alia! Alia! Alia!
Please.
Take care of Mom and Dad.
Promise me, Alia.
I promise, I promise.
But you've to keep fighting, Adli. Please keep fighting.
Adli!
Adli!
We must go now.
Alia! We must go now!
Let's go!
Over here!
Okay, our secret entrance is there.
What now? What do we do?
I will count to three.
We run together, and don't ever stop.
Okay.
One,
two,
three!
Sam! Sam! Sam!
Sam! Help me, Sam! Sam!
Get lost! Get lost!
Teacher!
Adli!
Kechik!
Kechik! Run, Kechik!
Faster, Kechik! Faster!
Kechik!
Kechik, faster!
Hey, Farid!
Get in Kechik!
Kak Fiza!
Harder, Kak Fiza! Harder, Kak Fiza! Harder!
Harder!
Let's go!
This way. Hold this.
Teacher!
Get in! Get in!
Help me!
Kak Fiza. How can I help?
Do you know what a crank handle looks like?
Yes, I know.
Okay, Kechik, please help. Thank you.
What else should we do, teacher?
We've to wait for the generator.
Can we make it, teacher?
What if we can't make it?
I hope we can make it till dawn.
Nazmi.
Who are you?
It's me, Wari.
I'm here to help you.
Follow me, Nazmi.
Follow me.
You won't feel any pain.
Your suffering will end.
Follow me, Nazmi.
Hey.
My pain…
my life, what do you know about them?
I know about your children.
About your wife.
Isn't this world unfair?
What sins have you committed?
Why did he do this to you?
Follow me, Nazmi.
Teacher.
What happened to your family?
Dear, what do we do now?
You told me you would be coming back.
I was going to give you a surprise.
Surprise?
What surprise?
What surprise do you want?
Dad! Let's go to the zoo, shall we?
Let's watch movies.
I want to bring you to the funfair!
Yes.
Dear,
it'll be fun.
But won't you feel tired?
I'm not doing this all the time.
Every day I ask God.
Why?
Why it wasn't me who died that day?
Sarah.
Honey!
-Dear. -Honey!
Honey! Sarah!
Forgive me. Forgive me.
My dear.
I am okay.
Don't worry.
Our kids are waiting for us.
Follow me, Nazmi.
Teacher! Teacher!
My dear, don't worry. Follow me, Nazmi
Our kids are waiting for us, my dear. Follow me, Nazmi.
Follow me, Nazmi.
My dear.
The kids are waiting for you.
Dear.
Follow me, Nazmi.
Teacher! Teacher! Teacher!
Teacher. Teacher.
Teacher.
You go.
But we can leave together, teacher.
I…
Soon…
I will be like them.
Hey.
Remember your promise to Adli.
Thank you.
Please.
Wait, Kechik.
I'm trying.
Why is it acting this way?
Wait.
I don't know why.
Wait, wait.
Allah, there is no deity except Him
the Ever-Living, the Sustainer
of all existence.
Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep.
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens
and whatever is on the earth.
Who could possibly intercede with Him,
except by His permission.
He fully knows what is ahead of them
and what is behind them.
And they encompass not a thing
of His knowledge, except
for what He wills to reveal.
His Kursi encompasses
the heavens and the earth.
And it is not difficult for Him
to preserve them.
And He is the Highest
and the Greatest.
Follow me, Nazmi.
A fire that took place at a hostel has killed more than 20 people.
The police are still investigating the cause.
The public are advised
not to spread any false information and false news on social media.
Three victims were saved
You want my business?
You can have my entire business!
Please… let me go.
Don't take my life. Please.
Please.
MY LOVE Aiman Zalini
All you do is play on your phone.
Listen. Pick me up at 5:00.
No!
What do you mean "No"?
It's up to me if I want to open my shop or not.
Go home!
I just need to buy a mat!
Open your shop!
-Go home! -No!
This damn kid. I am already late.
You better go home.
Don't make me come down
'cause I will beat you up and stab you!
What do you want, Mom?
I'm cooking. Give me a little more time.
A little more time, Ani?
It's been half an hour!
What about my customers?
They've been waiting.
What do you want them to eat? Sand?
Hurry up! I need to cook!
Patience, Mom. It's almost done.
Don't forget to vote for me.
Don't be scared. You're definitely going to win.
Don't be nervous.
Hope for the best.
Peace be upon you, everyone.
Have you all eaten?
Piping hot fried rice vermicelli.
Is it halal?
Of course it's halal.
What are you looking for?
The subtitles.
Okay, ladies.
We can begin voting now.
I'd like to remind you to form one line.
One line!
Go ahead!
WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION ELECTION
I'll definitely win this year.
You think you can win?
Just you wait!
SINGER'S SHOCKING REVEAL
PRESS CONFERENCE!
The disappearance of the head gangster, Mat Todak,
was confirmed by his wife
as he has not returned home for three days.
The last time his wife saw the victim…
Good riddance!
People like this do not belong in this world.
He is a menace to society!
What is so great about being a gangster?
I will never understand.
What do you think, ladies? Do you support this?
Renowned singer, Aiman Zalini, has announced his retirement.
The sudden announcement was made
in Kuala Lumpur just now.
The time has come for me to resign
while everyone still loves me.
But do not despair.
I have happy news
as I will be organizing my final concert.
This concert will be slightly different
as it will be up close and personal.
An intimate event for 100 people only.
So, buy your tickets now.
And I have a special treat.
Go to my website now.
Register your name.
And in ten minutes,
we will pick one lucky winner
who will win three free tickets.
Why don't you try your luck? I can't because I'm bad luck.
Here's another one!
Someone who leads people astray!
It's all marketing! Don't be fooled!
His ticket prices are cutthroat!
He'll say it's his last concert. Then there will definitely be a reunion!
Then another concert! He'll just keep leeching our money!
Use your brains. Don't give in to desire!
Do you agree, ladies?
Agreed!
Why are you badmouthing him?
It's his concert.
He can charge what he wants.
Why are you so offended?
I've been listening to everything. What a heated argument.
Please mind your manners, ladies.
Peace be upon you.
I would like to announce
the new president for our women's association.
But before that, I would like to invite our presidential candidates,
Datin Martipah and Ms. Rohayu Md Jusoh
to please come up to the front before I announce the winner.
Clap louder!
Thank you
to both our big shots.
Where's the envelope? There it is.
These are the results…
You're sure this is the correct envelope?
With 99.9% of the votes,
the winner is
Datin Martipah!
Success!
Look at that!
Even your best friend endorses my win.
We did it!
You're happy that I lost?
We won the tickets!
-What tickets? -Tickets to Aiman Zalini's concert!
Aiman Zalini!
-What is this? -What is that?
It's nothing. It's a YouTube video.
YouTube? That was Fikri's face!
No, it wasn't.
Where are you going?
Where else? I'm going to bed.
I have to go to the college tomorrow.
Tomorrow is Saturday!
I have additional classes.
Don't try to fool me.
Sit down! Let me school you!
Mom! I love you so much, Mom!
Go to school! Study well!
Don't waste time on love! All the men out there are useless!
Ana!
Aiman?
Yes, my love.
What are you doing here?
I want to watch you sleep.
You're such a pervert.
Should I be afraid?
Or should I be happy?
You should be happy.
Aiman?
Where are you going?
You said you wanted to watch me sleep.
Aiman?
Freeze this moment
Because I'm happy I am with you
Believe me
My heart only has eyes for you
I will do anything for you
You can hold me to my word
I will make you happy
My love, my life, my death
It is all for you
It was just a dream?
The devil must have ruined our dream.
Why don't we try again, baby?
Make sure you join me, okay?
Why aren't you coming to me?
I'm so frustrated!
You sure the tickets are coming today?
We just need to remain positive.
Oh, please.
You'd remain positive even if your restaurant burnt down.
Watch your mouth!
What if Ani's restaurant really burns down?
The mailman.
Hurry up!
The mailman.
Hurry up!
That's not the mailman.
Why did they have to take this road?
The mailman!
You're so rude, Amat!
The mailman! Stop, kid!
The mailman!
The mailman!
I'm going to throw my slipper at the mailman now!
Ani, you said the tickets were arriving today.
-Don't get angry. -I am furious!
You were quite sexy just now.
Enough walking?
Still want me to hurl my slipper at the mailman?
Forget it. That's not necessary.
Booster tickets?
Aiman Zalini?
For those three widows?
Do you know what I should do?
One.
This is what you deserve.
Two.
Three.
This is what you deserve!
I regret tearing these tickets up.
Now I have to pick them up.
Wait a minute. I only tore three tickets.
Where did the rest come from?
Forget it.
You boys! Nothing better to do?
You're a bunch of slackers!
Hey, Midah.
Has Ani called Aiman Zalini's people?
Yes.
But they said it's not their fault if we never got the tickets.
There. That's all.
60.
60?
All this costs ten ringgit at most!
You're right. It is ten ringgit.
But you owe me 25 ringgit for revving your bike in my face.
And another 25 because I missed when I threw my slipper at you.
So, that comes up to 60.
Whatever.
-Want a plastic bag? -No.
Please pass that to me.
Where do I put it?
Here.
Where should I put that one?
Here.
Look at that Amat.
I think something is wrong with him.
How can you say such a thing?
That boy is an orphan.
You can't give an inch to people like that.
Remember this morning
when he revved his bike in my face?
The boy has no manners!
Then what's wrong with you?
If you know he has no manners,
why did you let him rent the shop next door?
Look at what's happening now.
A bunch of kids hang out there vaping.
It's better that Amat rents it rather than leave it empty.
He isn't selling alcohol.
It's only vape.
Do as you please.
Here. How much?
Hey, Midah.
Is this for real?
How come our tickets haven't arrived?
Don't tell me
the mailman stole them?
My love, yes, my love
I am at your mercy
My love, yes, my love
What are you thinking about?
I'm listening to the cleric's sermon.
Don't lie.
I was thinking about the tickets!
You should be thinking about the tickets.
I think I'm cursed, but you're as cursed as I am.
Why didn't you use my shop's address?
If the mailman wanted to steal the tickets, the address wouldn't matter.
That's logical.
-That hurts! -You're backing her up?
What is this? That's enough.
I don't care.
I'm going to that concert by hook or by crook.
It means the world to me.
Just buy a ticket then.
Those tickets are 15,000 each. You have that much?
The topic of my sermon tonight is providence.
Now, there is a modern saying that says,
"Fortune will always find its way."
But the tickets lost it way, right?
Where good fortune is concerned, we often overlook effort.
Effort is important.
If we do not put in any effort,
how can good fortune happen?
-Don't you agree? -Yes.
Effort. Positive.
If God wills it, if we are sincere,
we will get what we want.
What's important is
to surrender to God's will,
to pray,
to make an effort.
God willing.
Mom! Ani! Rohayu!
You can't do this!
It's wrong!
We're just trying to make money, Ana.
Nothing wrong with trying to make money, Mom.
But why did you sell a hijab to Priya?
Priya is Hindu. She doesn't need a hijab.
You should be a little sensitive.
But I told her it was fabric,
not hijabs.
Lies!
Yes, she told me it was fabric!
But it's square, so it's definitely a hijab!
This is part of her conspiracy to convert me to Islam!
Crazy woman!
Is this true, Mom?
It wasn't like that.
She misunderstood.
My only intention was to con her of her money.
Isn't that right?
Rohayu, your shop's cutthroat prices are the talk of the village.
Who said that?
Datin Martipah and those illegal motorcycle racers.
Really?
Really!
Why would these kids lie?
How can Rohayu charge me 80 ringgit for this soap?
Why are you complaining to me?
Complain directly to Rohayu.
Of course she's scared.
If there's a problem, say it to my face.
Why is she gossiping instead?
So it is true!
You increased your prices.
And you're no better, Ani.
You raised your food prices.
No, I didn't raise my food prices.
I just started charging a service charge.
It isn't a service charge! It's a hidden charge!
That crazy Ani!
How can she charge us for her cutlery and furniture?
She thinks her tom yum stall has got five-stars?
I'm better off asking my husband to cook!
-Isn't that right, dear? -But I am blind.
-That was clever, Ani. -Really?
If I had known,
I'd have charged for the newspapers that I wrapped the hijabs in!
Don't be like that! Take this seriously.
Ana, we're doing this to earn extra money.
You expect us to borrow money from loan sharks?
There's no harm in earning extra money, Mom.
But there's a limit.
The people in our village aren't rich enough to be swindled.
Your kid is making such a fuss.
Let's have a drink first.
That Amat!
Ever since he got that big bike, he has become arrogant.
Look at me with your love
Do you like my voice?
Peace be upon you, Mat.
What a lovely bike.
Was it expensive?
Have I done something wrong?
I'm sorry if I revved my bike in front of Midah's house earlier.
Why are you bringing that up?
We just want to admire your bike.
A bike like this is usually expensive.
How did you get the money?
If you ladies want to accuse me of stealing,
let's go to the mosque now.
I'll swear--
Where am I? Why am I tied up?
Where am I?
Amat.
Amat.
We just want to know how much you earn in a month
by only selling vape?
Do you have to tie me up to ask questions?
Then, answer us!
I can't tell you how much I earn!
If I do,
Rohayu will raise my rent.
If you tell us, I promise I won't raise your rent!
How much?
30,000!
Amat.
Teach us how to sell vape.
What on earth?
We just want to buy concert tickets, Mat.
After that you'll steal my business!
What now?
If you don't teach us how to sell vape,
I'll lock you up in my room.
Would you like that?
It's not fair for you to threaten me like this!
Get a load of this!
Well?
Well?
If you want to sell vape,
go ahead.
Amat, teach us how to sell it.
Want to know how I can earn 30,000 a month?
Come here.
I make my own vape flavor.
But I added something special.
So, if you want it to taste good, make your own vape flavor.
I guarantee it'll work.
What is that special something?
Marijuana!
I'm innocent, Sir.
Save it for the police station.
Rohayu!
Mom told me Amat sold marijuana-flavored vape.
Shocking, right?
So bold of him!
It scares me.
Oh, my.
I was just thinking of running a vape business.
Amat said he got rich because he made his own flavor.
But I never imagined he was using marijuana.
Ana, do you have any friends
who can help us make a vape flavor?
Marijuana-flavored?
No! Not marijuana-flavored.
I have an idea!
-But promise me you won't tell Mom? -I promise.
Okay. Let's go.
-Make what? -A vape flavor.
Is this a trick?
It's like this.
We desperately need money.
Because we want to buy Aiman Zalini's concert tickets.
You didn't have to tell him that part.
Everything is a secret.
I know nothing about vape flavors.
Ask him to try. Just give it a go.
Why don't you learn?
You're a lab assistant after all.
These concert tickets mean a lot to me.
I am a lab assistant but…
Here's the thing.
If you help us,
Midah will bless your relationship.
Seriously?
I really want to help.
But I don't know.
I don't understand why Auntie Midah doesn't like me.
I have known Midah for a very long time.
There's a reason why she's like this.
1988 WISHFUL BLISS ON INNOCENCE
When she was young, all she did was work
because she knew she was an orphan.
So, she had to forge her own path in life.
Her uncle tried to matchmake her with Mansor.
She refused.
But after much persuasion, Midah agreed to the marriage.
A day after the wedding,
they accused Midah of not being a virgin.
Midah tried to explain that she was a virgin.
But no one believed her.
That's why Midah does not trust men to this day.
Rohayu, is there a flashback of my birth after this?
Enough of these sad flashbacks.
Your mom looked horrible during your delivery.
It's better not to show you.
She's right, Ana.
Your mom looked horrible while giving birth to you.
It was a frightful sight.
She looked like this.
This is lame!
Get out of my way!
Fikri, your girlfriend is a psycho, just like her mother.
It's true.
Is your mom a psycho too?
No?
I refuse!
Even so, there's no point stabbing that palm fruit.
Who asked you to strike a deal behind my back?
It was Rohayu's idea.
She's fierce.
What if she stabs us?
Who else if not Fikri?
You mean to tell me no one else can make vape flavors?
Who else is there? Can you do it, Ani?
Me? I sure can!
Let's see.
Spicy pineapple-chutney-flavored vape!
What do you think? Would you like that?
Would you like that?
Like it? I feel like vomiting just hearing it!
Then?
Who else is there apart from Fikri?
What did he say?
He agreed.
Of course he agreed!
He wants my daughter Ana!
Here's what you don't know.
I've made a good deal with Fikri.
He has agreed to break up with Ana.
Just like that?
Yes. I told Fikri we'll give him 30% of the vape profits.
So, he agreed to leave Ana, but don't tell Ana.
Are you for real?
Why would he agree so quickly?
Why do you think?
He probably bought all those certificates!
Why are there so many? Did you photocopy them?
Don't say that, Midah.
We must give him the benefit of the doubt.
Yes. Give Fikri a chance.
Whatever.
Fikri? Do you want a napkin?
To wipe it up?
Only 30 ringgit for a pack. You want it?
Most people don't do work when they're on a date.
Ana, this is important.
I have to make sure this vape flavor is a success.
How much longer do we have to keep doing this?
Meeting in secret.
Patience. Okay?
If this vape flavor is a success, your mom will bless our union.
My mom has always decided everything in my life.
It's not like I listen to her anyway.
What she's trying to do isn't wrong.
But she should at least let me choose my own path.
Right?
You're right.
But my mom says I'm as stubborn as banana sap.
Deep, right?
-Banana sap? -Yes.
It's hard to remove once it has stained your clothes.
That's why she says I'm as stubborn as banana sap.
Banana sap!
Introducing the most delicious vape flavor in the world!
What are you waiting for?
-What do you mean? -Try it!
Me?
Who else? If somebody has to throw up, it's you.
Okay. Give me a sec.
Hurry up!
It's amazing! Try it!
Ouch!
If we don't try it,
how do we know it's good?
I know who can try it.
You know something.
I want to create an app.
Create an app?
App?
Like the ones in phones?
Yes!
Just imagine.
If we have our own app, everyone can buy our drugs online!
We'll make millions!
This is the problem with our people.
When someone has vision, a creative idea, they laugh at it.
You have an idea for an app too?
Don't try to run away! You guys are all immoral.
No, I am innocent! My friends led me astray!
I'm too fat to be a drug addict!
-It's those two! -Shut up!
Don't be afraid.
We just want you to try this.
-What is that? -Just try it!
Don't do it.
My mom said not to take things from strangers.
It's a trap!
We're strangers? I see.
You don't know me? We've never met?
Take that!
It's so refreshing! I feel like a newborn.
Pak Brahim!
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
You ordered another one?
I'm thirsty.
Is it true that Pak Brahim and Mak Timah were commandos?
Probably.
Look at the walls.
Perhaps they bought them.
You're the best at slander.
Ani.
Mom said
the drug addicts stopped doing drugs
because of the vape that Fikri made.
-Is that true? -Yes, it is.
Do you know what those kids said?
Our vape is more addictive than drugs!
Isn't it illegal?
No, it is not!
Fikri said he used banana sap, cloves, star anise.
It's all organic.
Your boyfriend is a genius.
You've caught a good one.
Clever me!
Okay! Now we have a product!
Now we have to name our product!
Right?
Gersang!
What? Gersang?
No. Not Gersang!
Sap and banana. Gesang!
That's a terrible name!
Why not name it "Midah"?
Ana, design it nicely.
Then, add my face to it.
That's just as bad as the previous name.
Why not name it "Ayu" after me?
Then put my picture on the bottle. Don't you agree, Ani?
How dare you cross me?
I am older
Show some respect!
Walk with your head bowed
Before I give you a bump on your head
And please don't make so much noise
Aren't you afraid of being mocked?
I don't mean to be spiteful
The reality is I am the king
Look from your face to your heart
The mirror says you're on death's door
I don't mean to hate
But the vape idea was my stroke of genius
Oh, enough fighting
Let's not hurt each other
Live peaceful lives
Calm your hearts
Let's not poison each other
Live peaceful lives
Calm your hearts
Live peaceful lives
Calm your hearts
You've kicked the hornet's nest
Just you wait, I'll turn you into dust
Don't call yourself a woman
If you're scared to fight
Just die, I'll get you your tombstone
Rohayu arrives boom boom like thunder
Midah, you plague, you're going nuts
Plenty of signs in your behavior
Your power craze will lead to disaster
Look at the face of a future leader
I am crazy, power crazy
Heed my words, I am the oldest
You have no choice but to heed my words
Flickering, the fireflies dance
So full of yourself, you're blinking
You're unaware of yourself
Be quiet and wallow in disappointment
Sheep cry when they lose their shepherd
Do you realize your life is in danger?
The business is just about to start
Don't sink and become a beggar
Oh, enough fighting
Let's not hurt each other
Live peaceful lives
Calm your hearts
Let's not poison each other
Live peaceful lives
Calm your hearts
Live peaceful lives
Calm your hearts
The fawn returns at dusk
I don't mean to be a bother
But don't you realize I'm the star?
I'd look majestic on the jar
Jar? We're selling vape juice, crazy!
You think we're selling Eid cookies?
Noraini, do you have a death wish?
You're as pretty as the sole of a foot
You're making a fool of yourself
Here's a mirror Go assess yourself
Live peaceful lives
Calm your hearts
Live peaceful lives
Calm your hearts
Calm your hearts
We can't use any of those.
No one will buy vape plastered with your aunties' faces on it.
Actually, I'm not that old.
I'm still a virgin, you know!
Let's do this.
If we want to be fair, I suggest we name it
M-R-A.
Now that's more like it!
We can still use my face, right?
It's fine even if it's at the bottom of the bottle.
You're competing for the most beautiful with wrinkly faces like that?
Makes me want to puke!
My love!
Search until you find
the person who killed your brother!
Where are they, Midah?
Your daughter asked us to wait.
Does she expect us to wait until dawn?
I don't know.
She said some influencers want to buy our vape today.
Your daughter was right.
Ani. Midah.
These influencers said MRA's product is the best.
They want to buy it.
We have our first customers!
But they can make it go viral if it's free.
What?
What are you thinking? Asking for it for free?
Does this look like a charity house?
Midah, don't berate them.
They look so pitiful.
Let them have it.
That's the problem with you. You pity people.
How about this?
I can give it to you for free.
Hold your horses.
But the terms are that
if you buy one carton, I'll give you five free bottles. Five bottles?
Five?
-Give us a moment. -That was a smart move.
They want it.
They're willing to buy six cartons!
What's that? We have our first customers?
Six cartons have been sold
It's going viral
Cigarettes and drugs are no match for us
The more you smoke
You feel good all the way to your feet
People have started buying in bulk
Our vape is already number one
We're rich, so very rich
The money is coming in nonstop
Every day is our day
Not enough fingers to count all this money
The concert tickets have been bought
Now we're waiting to go
But what do we wear?
We'll just buy clothes online
They sell all sorts of clothes
It makes our imaginations run wild
Colorful and sparkly
Our clothes are lit
We're rich, so very rich
The money is coming in nonstop
Every day is our day
Not enough fingers to count all this money
We're rich, so very rich
The money is coming in nonstop
Every day is our day
Not enough fingers to count all this money
In economics, they call it demand and supply.
But in our line of work,
if addicts want our product, we sell it to them.
-Am I a genius? -Yes, Boss.
This stock has been sitting here for more than a week.
Why?
Because there is no demand!
-And why isn't there any demand? -Because no one is buying it, Boss.
Wrong!
Because no one is doing drugs anymore.
Am I a genius?
-Yes, Boss. -Yes.
Now let this genius try it.
Is that all right?
Yes, Boss.
I agree with you, Boss!
We can use the person who made this flavor
to make our own awesome product!
Find the person who made this.
Look at what we've got!
Aiman Zalini!
Aiman Zalini!
Aiman Zalini.
We're screwed.
What's Ana doing in Fikri's car?
No reason. Maybe he's just dropping her off.
It's nothing. That's right.
What is this, Ana?
-What, Mom? -This!
Don't we have a deal?
What deal?
Okay. We can explain.
-Ani, explain. -Not me. I don't know how to lie.
I will blabber the truth.
It's better if you explain. I'm scared.
Rohayu said you agreed that
if Fikri made you a vape flavor,
you'd bless our union.
Bless you? No such thing!
But the other day…
Rohayu told me you broke up.
That's not true!
Rohayu, you've gone too far.
Too far!
You used my name…
and made a deal behind my back.
You tricked me!
You wouldn't have agreed otherwise.
Of course I wouldn't have agreed!
You wouldn't have those tickets if you didn't agree!
This isn't about the tickets! It's about life and principles!
What's the point of living without principles?
You and your principles!
Do principles put food on your table?
I always back you up and support you because of my principles,
even when others speak badly of you!
Did you know that?
So, you're bringing that up?
I'm not bringing up the past, Rohayu!
I feel like you're cursed!
I'd rather be cursed than forcefully divorced like you!
Hey! Get this straight!
I can get a man anytime I want!
But you can't even get a man!
A man would die if he tried!
Allah is the greatest
Allah is the greatest
Allah is the greatest
Allah…
It's past the time!
Continue your fight.
Go ahead. Fight.
So, who gets to hold on to the tickets then?
These tickets? I've got them.
I can do whatever I want with them.
I can even tear them up.
Tear them up then!
I want to see your so called principles!
You and your principles make me sick!
-You! -Don't, Midah!
You're no better. You conspired with her!
Midah.
How could you?
Ani? Are you okay?
I'm okay, Mom.
If my husband, Amar, was still around,
none of this would have happened.
Dad? Mom?
Thank you for looking after me all this while,
even though I'm only your daughter-in-law.
But the two of you…
have always looked after me like your own child.
Thank you for looking after me.
-Hello. I'd like to know-- -The shop is closed!
Come back tomorrow…
Have you asked her?
We want to buy vape from the shop next door.
Do you know who the owner is?
I am the owner.
You can buy vape here too.
It's the same.
You're a genius!
So, you own the vape shop?
Me and my two best friends.
A bunch of geniuses!
No such thing. Fikri helped us.
Fikri is a lab assistant.
Why don't you come in?
Fikri!
Come on in.
Okay, I'll buy all the vape in this shop.
Wow! You're a genius!
This is the dowry.
If you buy a carton, you get a free keychain.
I want to apologize, Mom.
Mom!
I don't want to go to hell for disobeying you.
I don't understand why you hate Fikri so much.
It's not like I'm dating a drug addict
or a gangster or a politician.
I'm dating a lab assistant.
A kind, honest lab assistant to boot.
Where are you off to?
Midah!
My personal assistant showed me this video.
When she did her research,
we found out that you three ladies are my hardcore fans.
Is that true?
I am your biggest fan.
We're all your biggest fans, Aiman!
Thank you.
I was truly moved
and saddened.
Why are you sad?
Were there many tolls on the way here?
No. That's not it.
When my fans are sad, I feel sad.
It bothers me. I take these things to heart.
We're not sad.
Liar! Mom is sad.
The reason I'm here is to cheer my fans up.
So, I have with me…
three VIP tickets
with backstage access for my concert tonight.
This is to thank you ladies for your unwavering support.
Don't be sad anymore.
Till we meet again.
Madam,
I was asking for my phone.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Gold class tickets!
Gold class tickets, my foot!
What?
What is it now, Midah?
What do you mean "what"?
You thought these gold class tickets
would make me forget what you did to me?
-Give them back, Midah. -I won't.
And I mean what I say!
Even if I die and return, I'll never return these tickets!
Give them back, Midah!
Are you deaf?
I said I won't give them back!
Shut up!
All human beings make mistakes.
You, me, and Rohayu.
All of us make mistakes!
It's part and parcel of friendship.
We may hurt each other sometimes.
You may think, "It's just a lame concert!"
You two may think that! But not me!
This concert means the world to me
in ways the two of you may never ever understand.
1997 A PROMISE BURIED BY DESTINY
Before Amar went on his last tour of duty,
he did many things to make me happy.
He promised that when he returned,
he'd take me to an Aiman Zalini concert.
But that was the last time I saw him…
before the soldiers told us Amar was missing in action.
Amar never broke a promise.
He promised he'd go to the concert with me.
We'll all go together, all right?
And we'll pray that Amar is at peace. Okay?
I'm still mad at you, you know.
Where are you going?
To change my clothes. I can't go dressed like this.
Children,
you have to study hard when you grow up.
Then you can be rich like Mom!
And then you can bribe everyone!
Isn't Mommy's tail beautiful?
What do you want?
We wanted to thank you for making us go viral.
Thanks to your video,
Aiman Zalini personally dropped off the free gold class tickets.
Are you coming?
Don't try to fool me.
If you don't believe me, check out my Instagram.
Bye! Happy Eid!
You're so arrogant. Such a show-off! So proud!
Do you know what proud and arrogant show-offs deserve?
Hell!
I'm going to burn your shop!
I can explain, Fikri.
Save it for the police!
Have pity on me, Fikri. I'm an orphan.
Happy Eid.
The chairs are made of gold!
No wonder the tickets are expensive.
What are you looking for?
The subtitles.
He dare say that to us?
This is Malaysia, you know!
-He was asking us to take a drink. -It was just flavored syrup drinks.
If we were at my shop, I'd put three lychees in my drink.
Get your hands in there!
Oh, no! Fikri. Datin.
How are you guys doing?
Good!
Without further ado, our first song tonight
is one of my older songs,
"The Restlessness of Our Love."
-Just a little bit, darling. -It hurts, Timah.
Pak Brahim. Mak Timah. What are you two doing?
We're practicing for the theater. What do you know?
What are you doing here at this God forsaken hour?
I forgot!
Datin Martipah and Fikri have been kidnapped.
As if!
Or are you a Peeping Tom?
If you upload this on Facebook,
you're a goner.
What am I peeping at?
I'm telling you the truth.
Datin Martipah and Fikri have been kidnapped.
Why would I lie?
Untie me! I need to help them.
Damned thing is stuck!
Aiman!
Are you all okay?
For my next number,
a song about unwilling parting.
This is our favorite song!
Why does this daydream
Delay my memories with you?
The darkness in my heart
Only the sight of you can lift
I may never have another love like yours
I drown in the memories
Of my love for you
My love
My prayers are with you
Although I hope this is all a dream
Believe me
I know
That our ties
They all end here
You must move on with your life, darling,
and find happiness.
Ani? Are you okay?
I'm okay.
You're so bipolar. People are watching the show.
-Don't cry like this. -Okay!
Okay, let's go!
-But where do we look for Fikri? -I forgot!
Oh, no! My battery is dead! What do we do now?
Are you going to wait till dawn?
What is this app for, Ana?
I use this app to locate where Fikri is at all times.
You're a psycho, aren't you?
There he is!
-Is everyone okay? -Okay!
Thank you, my super fans!
Even though this is my last concert,
I do not consider tonight our last night together.
I think of it as a night of memories together.
-Do you agree? -Agree!
So, for tonight's final song,
I'd like to do something special.
I'd like to invite my gold ticket super fans
to come on stage with me.
That's us!
It's us!
Hurry up!
Hi!
This is for you.
My love
Your wink sets my soul aquiver
The beauty of your smile, sheer bliss
If I have to wait a thousand years
I will wait for you faithfully
My love, yes, my love
I am at your mercy
My love, yes, my love
I am happy in your world
Don't fool yourself
Just admit that you love me
My heart belongs to you forever!
My love, yes, my love
I am at your mercy
My love, yes, my love
My love, yes, my love
I am lost in your world
My love, yes, my love
You're the angel of my life
My love, yes, my love
I am at your mercy
My love, yes, my love
I am happy in your world
You sure this is the place, Ana?
Yes. This app is accurate.
If that's the case, you wait here.
We'll do reconnaissance.
Let us figure out who the kidnappers are and Fikri's exact location.
The gun.
-Did you bring the bullets? -I thought you had the bullets!
-Forget it. Let's go in. -I forgot the bullets.
-Oh, no! -What now?
My light isn't working, dear!
It must have burnt out.
This is what you get for buying products made in China.
It's cheaper! Now let's go!
I know you guys.
You guys asked about our vape the other day, right?
You're a genius!
Your brain is still sharp even in your twilight years.
Please disembark.
Get down? Where the hell are we?
This is part of Aiman Zalini's special performance.
Where are they?
This won't do.
It died again!
So many boxes of our vape! Look at that!
When did they buy all this?
They bought some but not this much.
These masks repel mosquitoes!
We can each wear one and chase away the mosquitoes in your garden.
Plenty of them in your garden.
Are you done?
Done.
Please come this way.
Hurry!
Who is that?
Welcome, everyone.
We're getting a special performance!
Boss, this guy tried to escape.
I'm begging you, Aiman. Please spare my life.
Take my business and my territories.
Please, Man. I'm begging you.
I know.
He's doing a magic show just for us!
This isn't a magic show.
Sorry, I had a personal matter to attend to.
Hey, Aiman.
Why did you kill him?
I killed him…
because he disrupted my business.
Just like the three of you.
What business?
We aren't singers!
Of course you aren't singers.
But you…
sell this.
Vape!
We only started that business to buy your tickets!
How much money do you think Malaysian singers make?
I'd rather be a drug lord,
so that I can make billions
and become a capitalist.
That's why I don't like competition.
So, I killed each and every one of my rival gangsters.
Like what you saw earlier.
But we aren't big time gangsters.
I'm just a plantation worker.
But you've disrupted my business, you nut job!
So, what are you going to do to us?
I don't want anything from you.
But I want him
because his vape recipe is awesome.
So, I want that flavor in my drugs.
I'm not going to do that!
What did you say?
I'm not going to do what you want.
That was very daring of you,
but you have to do as I say.
Otherwise, I won't let those three go.
Take them away.
Help me!
Aiman!
I can't believe you're a villain.
I wish you'd fall down those stairs!
I'm fine. I was just play-acting.
Didn't know I could act, too, did you?
What happened to the lights?
What was that sound?
I don't know.
Run!
What are you doing here? Go catch those old women!
Go check on the boss.
Who did this?
Over here!
The lights are back on!
Don't bother trying to escape.
There's no way out anyway.
You can't be afraid. I'm afraid. What do we do now?
We'll hide!
Where did the old woman go?
She ran so fast!
Don't you have any manners?
Happy Eid.
Aiman!
Why don't you come here?
Aiman.
Rohayu!
Come with me if you want to live.
So, we have a traitor in our midst!
How long are we going to hide in this room?
We'll wait until he goes home.
Who? Aiman?
This is his home. He's not going anywhere.
Oh, gosh.
Go ahead and run. Run.
Run.
Why did you cover my mouth? That was Rohayu.
Yes, that was Rohayu.
But didn't you see who was chasing her?
Everything I do is wrong.
Sit there quietly.
So, this is where you do your dirty work.
You're such a nuisance.
This dirty work is what is
going to keep you alive.
You want to fight!
I'm scared, Midah.
I'm scared of dying because…
next week it's my turn to get the chit fund.
I'm terrified but all you care about is your chit fund!
Then why don't you think about how to defeat Aiman?
Okay. How about this?
When he attacks us, you slap him hard.
While he's in pain, I'll grab his cane
and hit him really hard.
Then you stab him with your headband.
-What do you think? -Okay. Let's do it!
Mom! Ani!
Come here.
What are you doing here, Ana?
I saw Fikri and Datin Martipah getting kidnapped.
So, I asked Pak Brahim and Mak Timah to help me rescue them.
-They're here? -Yes.
Enough talk. Let's get out of here.
We can't leave. I have to save my in-laws.
They're ex-commandos. They can save themselves.
We can't do that.
-What about Fikri and Datin Martipah? -And Rohayu?
To hell with her!
How can you say that, Midah? She's our friend.
Enough! Let's leave quickly.
We can't just leave them to die here, Mom!
You and Rohayu have been best friends for ages.
We're in this mess because she brings bad luck.
She told Fikri to make that vape flavor.
That's why Aiman wants to kill us. This wouldn't have happened otherwise.
So, it's all because of her bad luck.
Midah! That's enough.
Rohayu has suffered enough. Don't keep bringing up the past.
How bad is her luck for Mom to say these things?
A long time ago,
Rohayu was married four times.
But all of them…
1989 A WIDOW MANY TIMES OVER
Hi, my dear.
Because all her husbands died,
the village said she was a harbinger of bad luck.
Only you defended her from the slander, Midah.
Fine. Let's go look for her.
So, you know how to stop running.
I'm so disappointed with you, Alpasino,
because you've betrayed me.
Let them go, Aiman!
Everyone is dating an auntie.
It's trending.
Run, Rohayu.
What about you?
You disappoint me.
First, because you betrayed me.
Second, because of your taste in women.
I'm very, very disappointed.
I didn't betray you.
Search until you find the person who killed your brother!
But you killed my brother--
It's your turn now.
Rohayu!
You're all safe.
Let's not fight anymore. Enough.
I apologize.
I don't want to fight anymore.
I don't want to lose my friends.
I feel the same way.
I love you, Midah.
Seriously, you're crying?
It's like I'm watching an Eid advertisement.
Everyone is here.
It's easier for me to kill all of you one by one.
Run!
Don't try to escape
if you don't want
these three people to be killed.
Don!
Don, this boy is mine.
Finally!
A worthy opponent.
Hey, old man. I don't use a cane to fight.
Old man?
Fikri.
Fikri.
Aiman!
I absolutely hate it
when someone messes with my daughter's boyfriend!
Don't try anything!
Let's do it!
Do you think you can defeat me that easily?
I have plenty of knowledge that makes me invincible!
Goddamn you, Aiman. May you get hit by a truck!
What would a truck be doing in this building?
Your injuries aren't that bad.
Thank you for saving us.
Ana?
You really like this unremarkable boy?
Don't play coy with me.
You're on probation.
If you do anything indecent with my daughter…
The village is big and secluded.
I will bury you in the palm oil plantation.
Your mom is psychotic.
What do you think they'll do with Aiman?
I don't know.
Send him to a police station?
If it were up to me, I'd take him to my home.
Geez. Look at her, Midah.
I'm very grateful that the three of us survived,
but I need to ask you two to forgive me.
I'm constantly berating you.
You two are my best friends to the end of my days.
Don't say that.
I love you too.
Eid is not anytime soon!
Such a busybody!
I should stab her with this headband to teach her a lesson.
How are you still alive?
Didn't Aiman shoot you?
This is what saved me,
even though it was…
Is this the end for us?
I want to throw up!
-Yes? -Hello, Boss? May we proceed?
SOMEDAY IN HEAVEN
The Lord is my shepherd;
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Amen.
Amen.
Milo!
Come, let’s play.
And have snacks, for Mary Ann’s birthday!
Take your dirty hands off me!
Come on!
Leave me alone! Go play by yourself!
Yaya Adora!
Yaya Adora! Papa’s home!
Yaya Adora!
Yes, I heard you!
We’ve been waiting for you. We expected you back sooner!
Boyong, we’re here.
What took you so long, Papa?
Wait, my dear. I’m all sweaty.
-Can’t you see Papa’s tired? -How was your trip?
It went fine, as usual. But the jeep broke down twice.
Papa, did you buy me the shotgun?
-No. You might shoot someone. -He wouldn't forget it.
Just birds!
-I bought you a shirt and pants. -It's not here.
That’s enough.
What about my dress, Papa?
How can I forget?
It’s at the back of the jeep.
Did you find it?
What happened?
My goodness! What on earth…?
Oh my!
He doesn’t bite.
I found him in Divisoria, going through trash bins, for food.
Felt sorry for him.
Found out he’s an orphan, so I brought him home with me.
I thought I'd save him from further harm, or growing up as a thug.
-Don’t tell me he's staying with us! -You’ll share your room with him.
No way! He’s dirty! Smells like garbage!
Adora, give the boy a bath to stop this one from barking at him.
Then you go rest afterwards, hear?
-Come, boy. -Don’t call him boy.
-Go with her, Gabriel. -Gabriel?
Follow me, Gabriel.
-Wait for me! -You can do it!
See? I told you.
What is this place?
My kingdom.
Kingdom?
What are you, a princess?
Whenever I’m here.
Wait, and see.
What are you going to do?
Just stay where you are. Don’t peek!
What are you doing?
Here I am.
Do I look like a princess?
Where’d you get that?
Is it nice?
I know nothing about dresses.
If I’m the princess here… I want you to be my prince!
A prince who wears hand-me-downs?
You could be one, for all we know.
Like, maybe you’re not really an orphan, Gabriel.
Your parents could be a king and a queen…
your home a castle made of crystal…
but you were abducted by bad men.
You fought back and luckily escaped!
-Yeah, right. -Why?
I’ve been sleeping in vegetable carts in the market, since birth.
Tomorrow, again?
Sure, so my horse gets used to me.
So who says this is yours?
Papa.
You didn’t just steal my horse. You stole my father, too!
But it’s true. Papa gave the horse to Gabriel.
You’re siding with this piece of trash?
Papa!
Listen, you leech! Everything here belongs to me!
Gabriel!
Gabriel!
-My God! What happened? -Get down from there!
You heard me!
Why did you hit Gabriel?
-He started it. -Liar!
You said you’d buy me a horse, but you gave it to him!
Because he needs it more than you do!
Truth is, you love that trash more than me.
Why, you think he’s replaced your favorite son?
Shut up!
I’ve put up with you long enough.
You’re a bad seed and you’ll only get worse.
I think you should live with your aunt in Manila
until you become worthy of the Salvador name.
Looks like you got a good beating.
But it’ll heal. Come, it’s time to eat.
You can’t catch me!
Oh, yes I can! Keep going!
I won! You lost, as usual!
Cheater! You didn’t tie your horse well!
Where have you been, you two?
Papa, this is for you.
Where did you get these?
Up in the hills, where Carmina dragged me!
Nice… really nice.
I’ll go to the ends of the earth for you, Papa.
And for me?
Carmina! Gabriel!
Hey!
What’s with you two? Can’t you see your Papa’s resting?
Let them be. I’m not tired anyway.
Alright. But you two need a bath. You’re filthy!
Look! Star apples! Let’s pick some!
-I’ll go first! -You never play fair!
Be careful!
There.
This is enough.
Let’s see what’s over there! Hurry!
-Come on! Catch! -What do you think I’m doing?
You’ve got sap all over you!
It’s your fault!
Look at them.
-They get along so well. -Then tomorrow, let's pick java apples.
I wish it would always be this happy and simple for them.
Don’t you want to rest in your room?
I’ll wait for them.
-Let's go! -Fine.
These are a lot.
Wait!
-Here’s a rotten one! -Like you?
Don't hit me! I'll throw these at you!
-Catch this one! -That's enough.
This is delicious when chilled.
That's enough already.
You are voracious.
I'm not voracious. You are!
Catch them all!
You didn't throw properly!
Papa! Look at these fruits Gabriel and I picked.
Papa, you’re better off sleeping in your room.
Papa?
Papa?
Papa?
Papa?
-Carmina, what happened? -Yaya Adora, Papa’s gone!
Papa!
Papa!
Adora!
The servants’ rooms are at the back of the house, right?
Yes.
From now on, I don’t want you staying in Carmina’s bedroom.
Yaya Adora!
Your brother’s right.
You’re a young woman now.
You don’t need me anymore.
And you, Gabriel!
You will live behind the stable.
-But Gabriel is no servant! -Let me remind you Papa’s gone.
I am now master of this house.
I hold sway over all of you.
You should be thankful I’m not kicking him out,
even if that’s what this parasite deserves.
Enough!
Well?
Your new room awaits you.
Gabriel…
I’ve been looking for you.
I want to be alone.
Don’t you want my company?
I don’t want you to see me like this.
-If I’m no use to you anymore. -Carmina…
You know you’re the only reason I tolerate Milo’s cruelty.
Why do you put up with it? Man up!
Or leave!
Where will I go?
To Manila.
Get a job there.
Soon as you’ve saved money, come back for me.
That’s what a prince would do for his princess.
He’d rescue her and keep her safe!
Manila’s another world.
And…
I wouldn’t know how to manage there.
And you?
I won’t leave you here.
I don’t want to be away from you, even for just a day.
Then I’ll go with you.
Where will we live?
How will we survive?
I’m not trained for any job.
How will I feed you?
Do I steal, to provide for you?
Are we really stuck in this rut, Gabriel?
Will we waste the rest of our lives here?
I have so many dreams!
Am I still a part of them?
But of course!
Carmina.
I would’ve killed myself a long time ago if not for you.
I live because of you.
I love you, Carmina.
Do you feel as much for me?
Ever since we were children.
Promise that you’ll love only me, for as long as we live.
Swear!
I give you my pledge, Gabriel.
As I give you mine.
May we be buried alive if we break this vow.
Adora's here!
We’re invited to the homecoming party
for Alan and Sandra Ilustre.
You’re going with me.
No Gabriel.
If Gabriel’s not going, I won’t go either.
Then don’t. Who cares?
Adora, more gin!
You think you can run from me?
Want to play games?
Where are you off to? Here I come!
I thought you were asleep.
You won’t let me rest?
You just might regret it.
-Let’s go to the party. -Party?
At the Ilustres’.
We’re invited.
Except… what are we going to wear?
Let’s go as we are. They’ll envy us.
You’re crazy!
Come, let’s go!
Let’s stay here.
What are we going to do there, anyway?
I want to see who’s there…
what they’re wearing…
that kind of stuff.
But we don’t know anyone there.
We won’t enter. We’ll watch from outside, take a peek!
It won’t take long.
Alright, we’ll be quick.
Then we’re back here!
Sure.
I can even spend the night with you, if you want.
Let’s go.
So many guests!
This is fun. It’s like watching a movie.
It’s a movie, alright…
Here comes the villain.
See that?
See that.
You see?
My brother is shameless!
Let him make a fool of himself.
There’s Alan. And that’s Sandra.
The albinos?
We used to play with them,
when Grandpa was still alive.
I don’t know if they’d still recognize me.
That’s a nice outfit Sandra has on.
Will I ever get to dress up like that?
If we were still rich,
I’d definitely wear clothes like those.
You think I’ll look good in them?
You’ll definitely look better than her.
Let’s go. My limbs are getting sore.
Just a little longer, please?
Look, they’re so happy.
They dance like monkeys.
It looks fun. I can do that too.
Carmina!
Gabriel! My leg! Help me!
-Who are you? How did you get in here? -Gabriel!
Wait! Please!
Well, well, well.
-And how did you two get in here? -What’s going on?
I’m sorry, Mrs. Ilustre.
But it appears our houseboy crashed your party.
-Who’s he with? -It’s Carmina.
-Let me go! -Gabriel!
She might have broken her leg.
-Gabriel, help. -I must take her in.
-Carmina… -Carry her in, quick.
Wait! Let me go!
-I’m taking her inside. -Gabriel!
-Where are you taking her? -Gabriel, don’t go home yet!
-Take her inside. -Don’t leave me here!
Carmina!
Let me go!
If you know what’s good for you, don’t ever come back!
That’s enough!
I’ll take care of him.
Gabriel.
Alan, what did the doctor say?
She’s fine. But she needs to rest.
-It’s a good thing it isn’t serious. -I know.
-Have you informed her family? -I’ve told her brother but…
How are you feeling, dear?
My ankle still hurts.
The pain’s bound to go.
Dr. Jacob says you can walk in two weeks.
-Until then, you’ll have to stay here. -Two weeks?
But I want to go home, like now!
I can’t allow that. Your leg needs to heal first.
And also, you were injured here.
You’re our responsibility.
-Ma'am? -Your food’s here.
Give me that, Susie.
Brother…
I thought you were going to the movies with me today.
Another time. We have a guest.
I’ll just ask one of the maids to go with me.
No. We'll go watch a movie tomorrow.
-Ma, I’ll take care of this. -Okay. Take good care of Carmina.
Blackjack!
Damn! It’s the way you dealt the cards!
Don’t blame me. It’s a game of chance!
Yes, it’s just luck.
Gabriel, you should’ve introduced your friends to me sooner.
They let me win all the time.
If this keeps up…
I might even forget about women!
Like him, Brenda left him.
-No, that's nothing. -That's nothing.
Don't worry! She'll come back for you.
Another game!
-Come on. -Another game!
I lost again.
-You deal the cards. -Alright.
This time, for real. I doubt you!
Hurry up so we'll win again.
-Oh! -Just wait.
Yaya Adora!
Carmina!
I was just about to fetch you!
I thought you’d never come home.
She wouldn’t, if it were up to me.
Wow!
You look like a model in that dress!
Alan’s mother gave this to me. Right, Alan?
I picked it out myself.
Milo!
Milo!
Alan, how are you?
I’m fine.
You look so pretty.
Yaya Adora, where’s Gabriel?
I think he’s upstairs.
-Gabriel! -This is 900,000.
Gabriel!
Gabriel!
Why are you so dirty?
Why were you gone for so long?
Why return only now?
They wouldn’t let me come home.
They wouldn’t? Or you didn’t want to?
Gabriel, please. Go take a bath. We have a guest.
What, did he roll in the mud with pigs?
Gabriel’s of no concern to you.
-But I only said… -You’re insulting him!
-Carmina, he’s just a houseboy. -It doesn’t matter!
He lives in my house.
If you respect me, you will respect everyone who lives here!
I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings.
I’d better go.
Alan!
Alan!
Did you see Carmina earlier?
She looked like a princess stepping off her carriage.
Well, it’s really no surprise.
Even as a kid, she’s always dreamt of living in a castle.
No such place here, of course…
although the Ilustre house can pass off for one.
What will I do, Yaya Adora?
Carmina’s changed.
Then you should change too.
Forgive me, Mr. Ilustre.
I couldn’t get an advance from you last week. I needed the money!
I’ll give you another chance.
But try to steal from our harvest again,
and you’ll get far worse than a beating.
-Am I clear? -Yes, Sir.
That’s enough! Get back to work.
Alan?
Alan!
You brought it here.
This one, too.
I want to…
apologize for the things I said the other day.
I just got emotional.
It’s okay. I understand.
Maybe it was just stress.
You’re right. Still, I’m ashamed of my behavior.
Especially after the kindness you and your family have shown me.
I’m thinking you’d be angry
-and never visit us again. -See this.
You’re right.
I won’t go there anymore…
because we’re going somewhere else.
Will you have dinner with me tomorrow night?
Just the two of us?
Yaya Adora, I don’t know what to wear.
My clothes are so dated and worn.
-I want to burn them all! -My goodness!
Why do you have to impress that guy? You’re penniless!
My God! If he really likes you…
you’d still look pretty to him even if you’re dressed in some sack.
Let him impress you instead. His family practically shits money.
Carmina…
Where are you going?
Don’t you know how to knock?
What are you hiding that I haven’t already seen?
Yaya Adora, please excuse us.
No, Yaya Adora.
I want to prove to you that what Alan said about this guy is true.
He has no manners and no respect for women.
And Alan worships you,
is that it?
He wouldn’t even touch me, for fear I’d get angry at him.
He values me like dear crystal!
Broken crystal, you mean.
Alan’s not judgmental!
Carmina…
look at Gabriel closely.
Don’t you notice anything different?
He’s….
He’s dressed up!
Oh so handsome!
From whose clothesline did you steal those?
Carmina!
He’s making an effort for you. What’s the matter with you?
Too late.
-Now that-- -Now that…what?
-Speak up! -Gabriel
Yaya Adora, please leave us.
-Gabriel! -I said leave!
Are you having an affair with Alan?
Let me go!
What’s going on between the two of you?
Stop it!
Do I disgust you now?
When I touch you, do I soil your clothes… your porcelain skin?
But who’s corrupting your heart and soul, if not Alan?
He’s making you vain and materialistic!
Why do you accept his love?
You think wealth will define and increase your worth as a person?!
You believe I’m not good enough to be loved by someone in his position?
Look at you!
You can’t even keep your own hands clean!
Is this all you see in me?
Here!
Now go show yourself to your Alan!
Son of a bitch!
What’s this?
I can’t accept it.
I’m giving you this, not for anything else,
but because you’re very special to me.
The first time I saw you,
I felt like I’d known you a long time.
What are you talking about?
It's like fire.
Think of us as separate flames.
When joined together…
we burn as one.
We’re soulmates.
Yaya Adora!
Alan and I ate in this really fancy restaurant.
It was so pretty!
They have those… how do you say?
Chandeliers?
And uniformed waiters, too!
Here, look at what Alan gave me.
I’ve never received anything like this all my life!
For all you know, that’s only glass.
You really think Alan would give a cheap gift?
And you accepted it in exchange for what?
For nothing!
He just wanted to give me this!
Oh, Carmina.
Every favor a man gives has a price.
What is your worth in Alan’s eyes?
Alan Ilustre is not crass like that.
Has he expressed his feelings for you?
Yes!
And asked you to marry him?
Yes.
What did you say?
I told him I’d think about it.
So, you gave him hope?
I didn’t reject him, if that’s what you mean.
And Gabriel?
Gabriel?
Yes. Gabriel.
What about the two of you?
The two of us?
What’s to become of us?
What future could I have, with him?
You know the kind of man Gabriel is, Yaya Adora.
It’s just that…
I don’t think…I can marry him.
It will…
It will degrade me too much.
I just…
I won’t be able to stand it.
Yaya Adora, why didn’t you tell me?
Gabriel!
Gabriel!
Wait!
Yaya Adora! Wait!
Gabriel!
Gabriel!
Gabriel!
Gabriel!
Gabriel!
Gabriel!
Where are you, Gabriel?
Gabriel!
Gabriel!
Where are you?
Is it me, Carmina?
Is this my fault?
Have I said or done anything wrong that’s made you ill?
How do I ask for your forgiveness?
Please go.
I want to be alone.
As you wish.
But please get well soon enough, so we can plan our wedding.
I’ve realized our souls aren’t one, Alan.
Right now…
mine is in hell.
We lost again!
-Pay up. -I told you…
-Pay up! -We lost.
-Give it to me. -Here.
-Pass me the beer. -You have no luck. I should've held it.
Let's drink up!
Milo…your sister.
Who is she?
So…
My dear sister’s finally decided to come home.
You roamed those hills again, didn’t you?
Whatever for?
There are lots of guys here.
Later.
Don't my friends look good enough for you?
Sure we do.
You've been shamed again.
Where are you going?
Don't fight it! Go with the flow.
I'm here for you.
-Gabriel! Help me! -Go ahead!
Gabriel!
Who is this Gabriel that you are calling?
That dog’s no longer here to defend you!
You've been rejected, bud!
Alan?
Carmina!
Let's get married.
You won't regret this, Carmina.
I'll make you happy.
I love you so much!
Welcome to the family, dear.
Long live the newlyweds!
Do you like it?
Of course. It's from you.
Do you love me?
What a question!
Just answer me.
Do you love me?
Of course.
I married you.
You're my husband now.
And you’re happy?
You don't regret marrying me?
What more can I ask for?
You’re all that I’ve dreamt of, as a child.
It’s like…
I lost my way in the dark.
Then…
I died…
only to wake up…
and find myself here…
in paradise!
Remember what I told you about soulmates?
I don't know how to thank you for everything you've given me.
I ask for only one thing.
Give me children.
That's it?
Yes.
But I want a dozen at once.
Who else would charter a plane to fetch us
for his wedding anniversary, every single year?
Leaving us no choice but to go!
You're lucky there are still some left.
Seriously, man. Do you like it here?
Don't you miss the traffic and pollution in Manila?
Or the night life?
If you had a wife as sweet and beautiful as mine,
why would you want a night life?
Carmina…
Go and sleep. I'll clear up.
Yaya Adora, what do you think of the dinner party?
It was fun, right?
More than our second anniversary dinner.
And they couldn't get enough of the dessert!
Alan’ll be upset to find out there's none left for him.
I don't think so. His friends were happy.
They like you, that's why they come all the way here, every anniversary.
I think I'll go to bed now, Yaya Adora.
Alan's waiting for me.
Carmina…
your earrings.
Good night.
You keep loosing.
Sorry.
It's always lacking.
Hey, it's you.
I almost didn't recognize you. What are you doing here?
I'm here to play, Milo.
I'll go ahead, man.
I've been out of luck all day.
I have nothing left to bet.
Of course, you do.
An agreement.
Win over me,
and you get a hundred thousand in cash
and my brand new car outside.
If I win,
I get this house and all else in your name.
You're so mean!
-Cut it out! -What is it, Adora?
Someone's here to see Carmina.
Who is it?
-It's Gabriel. -Gabriel?
Who is he?
He's…
Our former houseboy.
I remember now. The one who suddenly left.
Why don't you ask him to come in?
Don't! Tell him I'm not here.
Sweetheart, come on.
Maybe he’s found out you're already an Ilustre.
He could just be looking for a job, or a loan.
I don't want to see him.
How are you, Carmina?
Alan, you remember Gabriel?
-How are you? -Good.
-You look different. -Well, it's been a long time.
So what happened?
Hit it off in Saudi Arabia? Inherited money from a granddad?
I found out I was a prince
who got abducted by evil men when I was a boy.
Adora, my towel, please?
Have you met my sister?
Sandra, this is Gabriel. He used to work for Carmina's family.
How long are you planning to stay?
Forever.
You're not going back to…
where did you stay, anyway?
I've sold my house in Manila and decided to invest in real estate here.
Which property have you acquired?
Milo Salvador's.
-Milo sold his property? -Let's just say…
He gave it up.
I beat him at cards.
You clearly took advantage of my brother-in-law.
Just dealt the coup de grâce to one determined to ruin his life.
How come you didn't know your brother was struggling?
We could've helped him!
But you forbade me from going back there after we got married.
What's with you two? You're behaving like kids. We have a guest.
I'm sorry for the intrusion.
It wasn't my intention to stir a row between you.
By the way
I‘ve come to congratulate you on your wedding.
I'm sorry I wasn't around to witness it.
I have to go. I have things to take care of.
Carmina.
Is this what you’re looking for?
Where did you get this?
How quickly you forget.
You turned it over to me last night, in front of several witnesses.
I sent it out to be notarized.
Everything you own is now in my name.
You cannot steal what I inherited from my father.
This house, this property is mine. Mine!
I'm not stupid. I didn’t give you the original deed.
I'll kill you, you bastard!
Why warn me?
Pull the trigger.
Go ahead!
Shoot!
Do you recall how many times you've threatened to kill me,
but couldn't?
The day you tried to smash my face, when we were kids?
The night you and your thugs beat me to a pulp, and you pissed on my broken body…
yet fell short of killing me?
Even then,
I knew you had no balls, Milo.
And after all these years,
you still haven't grown a pair.
Your room behind the stable awaits you.
I’m going crazy, just waiting for you.
I've been here all day.
We have to talk.
We can't see each other.
Carmina.
Why did you come back? You shouldn’t have returned!
I’m here, because of you.
I came back, to take you away, like you’ve always wanted!
That was then, when we were young.
But things are different now. I’m married!
Nothing’s changed.
I know…I sense it, I feel it.
You don’t love your husband. You love me.
You have no right to say that.
-You know nothing about our marriage! -Why did you marry him?
Because his breath smells fresh?
Because he dines with silverware?
Because he makes love to you on a bed of money?
How lowly you think of me!
No lowlier than you think of yourself.
I won't let you go until you tell me why you refuse to leave Alan!
He loves me!
He's kind to me and he’s never hurt me!
I'd rather be living in pain from my wounds,
than dying a slow death from being alone.
I am not alone!
I have a husband, Gabriel.
Can't you understand that?
Get this, Carmina.
I went through hell for you.
I‘ve become worse than an animal…
crawled the ground like a worm…
I have killed…
sold my soul to the devil to get to where I am now…
thinking that when I came back from hell,
I’d proudly lay the world at your feet.
Your prince is back, my princess.
I'm here to save you…
to take you away…
to give you everything you’ve wanted.
We’ll live in our palace.
Alan’s here!
Carmina!
I swear I’ll take you from Alan!
No one can stop me! Not even you!
Someone's here to see you, Sir.
Sandra.
-Hi. -How are you?
I'm good.
-And you? -I'm fine.
Anything I can help you with?
I was on my way to a game, when my engine started groaning.
I didn’t want to risk the car conking out on the road, so I came here instead.
You have someone who can fix this?
Unlock the hood.
Start the engine.
Nothing wrong with it.
Really?
It even looks like it just got a recent tune-up.
Oh dear.
I don't know anything about cars. I only know how to drive.
We girls still have a lot to learn on these things.
We just need someone patient enough to teach us.
Don't get your handkerchief dirty. Give me that, I’ve got a rag here.
Thank you very much.
I can drive you, if you want.
Your engine might act up again.
Sandra! Sandra!
-Who let that bastard in here? -He's my guest!
Let's go. We're getting sunburnt anyway.
Water's so nice and cool.
-Want to come back tomorrow? -Sure.
I've always been suspicious of you.
But now, after hearing stories on how you became rich,
I'm certain you’re a thug from a family of criminals!
From now on, I don't want you anywhere near my sister! Is that clear?
Don't yell at Gabriel!
I love him.
I don't know from whom you’ve been collecting all this gossip,
but he treats me well.
Do you get me?
Do you know what you’re talking about?
-This man used to be a stable boy! -I know!
And I accept him wholeheartedly!
Your behavior right now speaks worse of you. Shame on you!
-Gabriel, that's enough! -Stop it!
-Gabriel! -Stop it!
-Stop it. -Let’s go. I don’t want you hurt.
You better leave. That's enough. Let’s go!
Let's go.
Get out! I don't ever want to see your face again!
What are you going to do? Kill me?
What for? You think I feel alive in this house?
-I'm just protecting you. -Oh please, you're protecting yourself!
Like only you and your wife are entitled to happiness here.
But what about me?
I will not stand being protected anymore. I will not grow old alone.
I will experience happiness, even just once in my life,
and I don't care if the man who can give that to me is a former stable boy!
Sandra.
-Sandra. -Gabriel.
Gabriel.
Listen, Sandra.
He’s not the man for you.
Forget about him.
He's only using you.
Using me for what?
He doesn't need my good name to boost his reputation because
he doesn’t care what people say.
Neither does he need my wealth because he has more money than I do.
We haven’t slept together, because he respects me as a woman.
So what do all these mean?
He loves me, period.
How can you be so sure?
He's asked me to marry him.
By the way…
Gabriel wants you to be my maid of honor.
-Only appropriate, since you're family. -No…
No.
You can't?
-You can't marry him! -Why?
You don't know Gabriel!
He's not human! He's a…
He's like…
a monster!
He'll crush your heart and shred you to pieces! Be very careful!
Why are you badmouthing him?
Are you in love with him?
-That’s not true! -Liar.
I don't know if Alan is just playing blind to your doings.
But my eyes are wide open, and I see clearly.
You're behaving this way because you're still secretly in love with Gabriel.
If you don't want me to tell your husband about this,
keep your claws off my man.
I'm begging you.
Don't hurt Sandra.
Don't use her to get back at Alan.
She's innocent.
They've done nothing against me.
But you owe me.
Then punish me, instead.
Oh, you’ll get it from me.
Once I swear before God to love Sandra until death tears us apart…
that’s about it.
You shouldn't have left me, Gabriel.
Fate decides for us.
And we’ll find out soon enough if fate is on our side or not.
Milo…
What if I say no?
Brother.
I’m only informing you out of courtesy and respect.
This is respect? You’re defying my wishes.
I have the right to do what I want to.
From now on, you have no control over me.
I'm surrendering my life completely to Gabriel.
-It's still my decision-- -Let's please end this conversation.
Gabriel and I need to finalize our wedding invitations.
You're both invited.
Let's go.
Alan, please stop them.
I don't give a damn about them anymore.
You have to stop them before it's too late.
-There's nothing I can do. -Don't allow it!
No matter what happens, you have to stop them!
-You heard what Sandra said. -They can't get married!
I won’t have it!
I'll die…
I'll die.
Gabriel,
Carmina sent me to tell you…
to meet her at the hills.
Gabriel!
I love you.
I can't lose you again.
Take me with you. I don't care where.
Don't ever let me go.
-Swear it! -I won't let you go.
-Swear it! -I swear.
We'll go somewhere far.
We'll get married in another country.
We won't ever come back here.
Let's go away.
Right now.
What is it?
I can't just desert Alan.
You just said you loved me!
And no one else but you.
But Alan’s been a good husband to me.
He deserves an amicable separation.
-But, Carmina, I though-- -Let me bid him a proper goodbye.
If I don't do this, it will always cast a shadow on us.
I’ll never be at peace with myself.
Don't worry.
I know Alan. He cares for me and would want only my happiness.
He'll understand.
If you go,
you'll never come back.
That won't happen.
When I leave Alan, there’ll be no one else but you.
Forgive me, Alan.
I know this is painful.
But it'll be worse if we stay together…
while my heart longs for someone else.
Let me go.
Let go of the burden you carry.
I don’t deserve to be your wife.
God knows I tried.
I did everything to make us work,
but we're just not meant for each other.
You can't do this to me.
Don’t!
-Who do you think you are? -Stop!
-Who the hell do you think you are? -Please!
No! Alan!
Enough, please!
Alan!
What’s going on?
-Please! You're hurting me! -Hey!
That's enough!
Alan!
That's enough!
You bitch!
No…No!
Open the door!
Why’d you shit on me?
Why, when I only idolized you!
That's enough! Open the door!
-Why? -Please!
Think I’ll let you off this?
Alan, please! Open the door!
I'm going to kill you! Cheating slut!
Alan!
That's enough!
Open this door!
Carmina.
What have you done to your wife?
You've gone too far! Carmina's helpless!
Adora!
Sandra! Tell the guards to lock the doors and bolt the gates!
From now on, no one enters or leaves this house without my knowledge!
Do you hear me?
Gabriel, forgive me.
Alan's my husband.
I cannot just leave him, nor abandon the good life he’s given me.
I hope you understand.
Dress up.
It's Gabriel and Sandra's wedding day.
I said get dressed!
I can’t…
Yes, you can!
I don't want to.
Alan.
There, you look like a human being again.
Do something with that face.
Don't forget you're still my wife.
You’ll conduct yourself properly at all times, you understand?
Don't you dare humiliate me in public!
May peace be with you.
Brethren, we're gathered here to witness
the blessed union of Gabriel and Sandra.
Sandra, do you take Gabriel as your lawfully wedded husband,
in the eyes of God and of the people,
for richer or for poorer,
in sickness and in health…
until death do you part?
Yes, Monsignor.
Gabriel…
Do you take Sandra as your lawfully wedded wife,
in the eyes of God and of the people,
for richer or for poorer,
in sickness and in health…
until death do you part?
Yes, Monsignor.
Carmina!
Help me!
Let's take her outside. Hurry!
Someone get water!
Sandra, Gabriel, by the power vested upon me…
How is she?
Congratulations, Mr. Ilustre! Your wife is pregnant.
About two months!
Are you tired?
Don't worry. I’ll try to relax you, okay?
-You like this? -Gabriel.
Gabriel.
I love you…
Gabriel…
Carmina…
Carmina…
You bastard! You deceived me!
You deceived me!
You deceived yourself.
You deceived me!
I forgive you, Gabriel.
I know you're not all black and horrible.
I understand you.
The world hasn’t been kind,
so you're hardened by pain and resentment.
I’ll take all that away!
I can make you happy… just let me try to love you.
Let me keep you in my arms, even for a while.
I’ll be your slave, I’ll do anything…
just to bring life back into you.
And how will you do that?
Through eyes so dead and empty?
They’re not empty!
If you’d only look deeper, there’s life in me!
I’m a woman. I’m pretty. I love you.
And I left my family for you.
Can’t you open your heart to me even just a bit,
with whatever little love you can spare?
How much do you love me, Sandra?
I'll go with you to heaven. Or hell! Anywhere.
What do you know of heaven or hell?
You know nothing of life or death.
Kill him.
Before he crushes you completely.
Coward. Just like me.
Where are you going?
To Gabriel.
I need him.
To break the news of his bastard growing inside you?
This is your child.
Our child.
Please believe me.
You really think I'm that big a fool, don’t you?
Let me go!
What have I done to deserve your cruelty?
I cherished you…
gave you the finest things.
I put you on a pedestal and worshipped you.
I bought you, you know that?
I own you.
Gabriel has no right to take you because you’re mine!
Confess that you married me for my money!
Admit it!
Yes, I did!
I was dazzled,
blinded by your wealth.
I sold myself,
and will never forgive myself for that.
Too weak to resist your offer,
I thought I loved you, when I really only needed you.
I hoped to come back to life here,
only to realize
I was going to die a long, slow death with you.
I don’t blame you. I blame no one but myself.
It’s all my fault.
Yes, it is. And for that, you will pay.
You ruined my life.
I've already paid you with my suffering.
Keep my body here as you wish…
but with you I’m good as dead!
I love Gabriel.
I've never loved anyone else, then and now, but him.
Not a day passed in our three years together,
when I didn't wish I was in his arms and sharing his bed instead.
Not a single day passed…
when I didn't betray you with all my heart.
Then you must pay for all that.
And I swear it will cost you dearly.
I will abort your bastard!
Over my dead body!
Not so fast!
Let me go!
Carmina!
Let me in!
Open the door!
Carmina!
Bitch!
I'm going to break this damn door!
Carmina!
Carmina!
There’s no escaping this house!
You'll never get out of here!
Carmina!
You are animal!
Carmina!
Get out of there!
Carmina!
Carmina!
Gabriel! Carmina is…
Gabriel.
Why did you do this, Carmina?
What's the point of living if we're not together?
You can’t die.
You can't leave me.
When I go,
you'll live in peace.
How, when my soul is dead?
Don't punish me. Blame yourself.
If you hadn't left me…
If you hadn't broken my heart…
I didn't break your heart, Carmina! You did.
We were one, together.
We swore to love no one else but each other.
But you discarded all that for someone else!
Forgive me.
Despite all the misery God sent our way,
no one could break our bond.
Except you. You tore us apart. You didn’t have faith in us.
Forgive me.
I beg you…
give me peace.
I forgive you for what you've done to me.
I love the woman who's killing me right now.
But I can never forgive you for snuffing the flame out of your life…
This is unforgiveable.
Unforgiveable.
Gabriel, Alan’s on his way. You better go!
I’m not leaving.
I don't care if he kills me. I'm not going anywhere.
Gabriel…
show me the hills one last time.
Do you see our kingdom?
Yes.
We'll live there someday.
It’s waiting for us.
We won't get the happiness we seek in this world.
But I know we’ll be together, loving each other in heaven…
for all eternity.
I'll wait for you there, Gabriel.
Don't take too long.
Carmina!
-Carmina! -Alan!
Alan, wait!
Let go of my wife!
She was never yours.
From her first breath to the last… she was mine.
Mine.
Mine.
Carmina.
Carmina.
Carmina.
I’ll never leave you in peace, for as long as I’m here.
I need you.
Don’t leave me in this darkness.
I can't go on without you.
Take me now…
wherever you are.
I beg you…
Gabriel.
It's over now.
We can finally live in peace.
Over?
Not for my Carmina and Gabriel.
They’re not dead.
They are just about to live.
Guards?
A Shukyou?
Who sent you?
No use telling a dying man.
The Council Room, hurry! Guards!
Protect the king.
Which state sent you?
-Shoubunkun. -The fault is mine.
Please, stay back.
Eisei. Die.
Miss me?
Shin.
Why are you here?
I sent him.
Shi Shi.
If you're letting thugs come here,
you're still far from unifying China.
You were once with Sei Kyou's rebellion. Why bring Shin?
Six months ago, Shin retaliated against the Shukyou and Muta on his own.
This former slave killed Sa Ji too.
I just thought he would be of more service to you than your guards.
Shin.
You bastard.
Thanks, Ten.
Smooth, huh?
Your Majesty, please, forgive me.
I have exposed you to danger.
Let me atone for my fault
with my life.
-You're so dramatic, old pal. -Old pal?
If the Shiyuu…
If only the Shiyuu were here…
you'd all be dead by now.
Shiyuu?
A legendary assassin clan with extraordinary powers.
It is said that it took only one of them to destroy a small state.
Monsters, huh?
They are called the Tribe of Sorrow.
Tribe of Sorrow?
Can't listen to this crap. Just a myth, right?
No matter who they are, I'll twist their wrists.
We mustn't let the outsiders know about the assassins' intrusion.
Be discreet. Your Majesty.
-Please, return at once. -What is it?
The Wei Army have crossed our borders.
Impossible.
It was a time of war and upheaval.
Seven states were at war on the great continent
for 500 years.
A war orphan called Shin, from the western state of Qin,
dreamt of becoming great generals with his friend Hyou.
However, while Hyou served as a body double for the king,
he lost his life in a power struggle for the throne.
With the young King Eisei, who aspired to unify China,
Shin and the Chieftain Yotanwa headed for Xianyang City.
Having reclaimed the throne,
Shin and his comrades were about to venture into a turbulent era.
QIN - WEI
And now, the neighboring state of Wei had started to invade their borders.
Qin and Wei were preparing for battle in the Dakan Plains.
QIN STATE, KING'S CAPITAL, XIANYANG
Assemble.
Wei made its move.
The beginning of a fierce war.
Once a slave, forever a slave.
But swords can change that.
I know.
I'll be the greatest general on earth.
Hyou, it's finally happening.
This is our first step toward being the greatest general on earth.
I wish you luck.
Thanks.
Ten, you wait here.
But… I'll be fine.
Great.
I'll go kick some ass.
Move.
Go straight ahead.
Hurry, or the war's going to end.
Shut up, brat.
Just hurry, moron.
Move your asses.
-Hey. -Shin, it's you.
The Bi thug brothers.
Don't call us that.
You're alive.
You disappeared after Hyou's death.
I thought you were killed too.
Yeah, Hyou.
We gave him a funeral. Many gathered.
Everyone loved Hyou, you know.
Visit his grave when you come back.
Right.
Thanks.
But I won't visit his grave until our dreams come true.
Shin, you've changed.
Where have you been?
I saved the king with my own hands.
I even got my own castle as a reward.
Talking nonsense again.
You and Hyou were always going on about being great generals.
Shut up. My path with Hyou starts right here.
Hey, wait. Wait up.
The Wei Army.
They're a menace.
Surrounded by enemy states,
they are accustomed to fighting all year round.
I'm afraid we're still forming units.
A slow start.
Among them is one of the Seven Fire Dragons of Wei?
Yes, Your Majesty, similar to our Six Great Generals,
Wei had the Seven Fire Dragons. I hear there is a survivor.
I hear there is a survivor.
If that survivor were to attack us…
He'd be a tough opponent.
What's that crowd?
Form a Go. Squad leaders, assemble.
Go?
-Don't you know? -Squad leaders, assemble!
Where have you been? Even rookies like us know.
What's a Go?
It's a squad made up of five men.
Including the leader,
five men will fight as a team and share the same fate.
All depends on which Go you're in.
You could come back distinguished or come back dead.
Hey, Koren and Setsu.
Join my squad.
Join us and I'll introduce you to my sister.
I'm married.
Hey, you two, you're coming with me.
You're…
I'm Mr. Hairou to you.
Out of the way.
Hairou took them all.
His squad is the toughest.
Next.
I get it.
The strong ones get picked.
Listen up!
I'm Shin from Jouto village.
The toughest guy around.
What the heck? I'm going to be the greatest general on earth.
What the heck? I'm going to be the greatest general on earth. Cut it out already.
You're miserable.
A leftover too?
He looks like a kid.
No place for you. Go home.
May as well get along, huh?
Hey.
I'm talking to you.
You.
Oh, you must be the leftovers.
I'm Taku Kei, your leader.
Since I look unreliable, I end up teaming with leftovers.
Who is this wimp?
But hey, we're five now.
I'm doomed. We're all going to die.
What's your name?
I'm Shin.
I'm Bihei.
I'm his brother, Bitou.
And you?
Our lives depend on each other. Your name, at least?
Kyoukai.
I don't like talking, that's all.
-Who do you think you are? -Let it go.
Get in line. A 1,000-Man Commander is passing through.
What's that?
A 1,000-Man Commander's cavalry is coming.
He may slay the insolent. Hurry.
Is that the commander?
Hey.
That fool's going to get his head chopped off.
Hey, Heki.
Long time no see.
Oh, Shin.
You look well. THE 1,000-MAN COMMANDER OF QIN, HEKI
Massacred?
That's right.
First, Wei invaded Gan Castle near the border.
Ninety thousand Wei soldiers.
Our 5,000 border guards confronted them at Gan Castle,
only to be destroyed.
When Wei knew General Hyouko was on his way to deal with them,
they abandoned Gan Castle and sent their armies to Dakan Plains.
Before they left, they set fire to Gan Castle
and massacred women, the old, and even newborns.
Tell me.
Which bastard did it?
Wei's commander-in-chief, Gokei.
-Gokei? -Yes.
He's one of the Seven Fire Dragons of Wei.
His origin is not Wei,
but he became a great general for his military talents.
Gokei has volunteered
to act as commander-in-chief to attack our state.
Adjutant Commander Kyuugen has secured the first hill.
General Gokei, we have secured two hills.
Now, the advantage is all ours.
THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF WEI, GOKEI
The hills are taken?
Positions for offense and defense.
Hills are like castles on level ground.
Easy to guard and attack.
General.
General.
General Hyouko.
Our troops have not yet assembled.
Wei has secured their defenses by taking both hills.
It's best to stay put.
THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF QIN, HYOUKO
Then we shall take back the hills from them.
Off to battle.
‎Yes!
‎Breakup!
What do you think?
A swift decision, maybe.
But isn't it wise to wait for our men?
A lot of blood will spill for sure.
Is our commander-in-chief to be trusted?
Hurry, Wei is taking up battle formations.
How much do we have to run?
It means we're behind.
Be prepared. At a time like this, many will die.
I'm feeling a vibe.
What now?
There's something ahead.
Hey, Shin!
Wait up.
All armies, halt.
So, this is the real thing.
Fourth Army Infantry, assemble.
Fourth Army?
That'll be us.
Let's go.
I'm your commander, Bakukoshin.
As of now, we will make an attack.
THE 1,000-MAN COMMANDER OF QIN, BAKUKOSHIN
Go Squads, get in line.
Line up!
Please, Commander.
We've been running for two whole days in the Dakan Plains.
Let us catch our breath.
There's no time.
But how can we attack without any information?
How dare you talk back!
Stop. Don't harm them.
They're valuable soldiers who will fight at the front.
Isn't that him?
Heki.
You're Heki, right?
Quit showing off, rookie.
Command your own squad.
Bakukoshin Army, in line!
Don't just stand there.
Listen.
Right now, we're outnumbered.
They've taken both hills, so we're at a geographical disadvantage.
All you have to do is this.
Take that hill from them with your lives.
Our troops will charge to the summit
and break through our enemy's defensive line.
What kind of command is that?
It's crazy.
Be prepared.
Bakukoshin is fond of launching suicide attacks.
Wimps like you will be wiped out on the spot.
Are we really fighting them?
You okay, bro?
What a wimp.
WEI ARMY, KYUUGEN'S CAMP, THE FIRST HILL
Commander.
Qin's infantry seems ready to charge on arrival.
They're charging on arrival?
Too hasty.
Without control of the hills,
they should wait for the rest of their men.
Sound the charge.
But our 3rd Army isn't here.
Doesn't matter.
What's that?
We'll be ordered to charge.
Remember, never go on your own.
Understood?
Okay.
Got it.
We're finally here.
Are you with me, Hyou?
For Hyou…
we have to make it back alive.
Infantry, get ready!
Regular soldiers, behind.
Ready.
Here we go, Hyou.
Charge!
Defensive formation.
What the hell is that?
Come back, Shin!
You can't go in there alone!
Come back!
Skewer that fool like meat.
Shin!
Die.
Surround him.
Let's get in there!
They're coming.
Push them back.
No way.
I can't do this.
Bro.
Bro!
Give me a hand.
You bastard!
Are you okay?
That hurt, brat.
Run! We're no match for him.
Leader Taku.
Now, run.
You wimps. Cowards can't do anything alone.
Shut up!
Cowards, maybe,
but this is how Go fight.
Let's go.
Fighting in a team of five is undoubtedly a good tactic.
Dammit. Shin jumped in there alone.
So, it's just us three wimps.
Where is Shin, anyway?
-You missed. -Dammit.
Commander.
Shin.
Commander, we're being pushed back.
Shall we summon our 3rd Battalion?
No.
Send in the monsters.
Come up and get me!
What the…?
This isn't good.
Running away?
They're retreating.
Did we win?
There you are, Shin! You're great!
Idiots!
Run!
Run for your lives!
Get up.
-Shin. -You saved us.
What is that?
Wei chariots.
Their most powerful armored chariot units.
Chariots?
We can't beat that.
The worst is yet to come.
That was just the first wave.
It's the second wave.
They'll come in numbers impossible to escape.
Our infantry is being attacked by Wei's chariots.
Please, send in the cavalry.
General Hyouko.
To all cavalries.
Yes, sir?
Hold your positions.
Yes, sir.
What?
Dammit.
We get no backup?
We're all going to die.
Stay behind me. I'll take my chances.
That's crazy.
Have a better plan?
I do.
-It's you. -Kyoukai, thank God you're alive.
What's the plan?
Make a barricade.
Barricade?
How's that possible?
By piling up the bodies.
This is no time for jokes.
Let's do it.
Everyone, pile up the bodies.
Leader Taku.
Hurry.
Dammit.
No orders to charge?
The flag says to stand by.
They're coming.
That's enough. Now, hide!
Shin, get back!
I see a puppy dog trying to escape. Run him over!
Dodge it!
We did it. Good job, Kyoukai.
Listen.
We ain't over yet.
It's just getting started!
Our chariots have destroyed their 4th, 2nd, and 1st Infantries,
except for some remaining in the 4th.
It looks like Hyouko has abandoned his infantry troops.
He is now isolated and cut off from his allies.
We have gained the advantage!
Commander-in-Chief Hyouko does not understand war.
Leave the garrison here
and send the rest of our men down the hill.
Wipe out the remnants
and we'll take Hyouko's head.
Yes, sir.
Reporting!
Kyuugen's main forces are coming down the hill.
How are our troops?
First Army, destroyed. Reporting!
Fourth Army, destroyed,
except for a few who survived the chariots.
It's a matter of time.
Second Army, almost down.
Third Army, struggling.
I suggest we retreat, General.
Well, so we have a few survivors in the 4th Army?
Yes, sir.
General.
I suggest we retreat for now.
No. Continue to stand by.
General?
Hold your positions.
Yes, sir.
More enemies coming down the hill.
When's help coming?
Try never!
Your Majesty, the battle report has arrived.
The battlefront?
Our infantry…
has been attacked by Wei's chariots.
They're on the verge of destruction.
I see.
Our troops, on the verge of destruction?
They're hunting for survivors.
Damn, we're stuck here.
Darn.
They're trying to finish us off.
The fewer enemies, the better. Move.
There they are!
Bihei!
Kyoukai, who are you?
‎Amazing!
Why didn't you help us from the start?
I have no obligation to protect any of you.
But we're on the same team.
Why did you come here?
There they are!
Right here!
-Not again. -We're dead.
I'll hold them back. Go. Now.
-But-- -Just shut up and go.
Found them.
This way.
Go. Now.
-Bro. -Surround them!
All right.
We'll meet up again, Shin.
Let's go. Hurry.
Bastard.
Let go.
Kyoukai.
Idiot, why did you stay? Go with them.
It's easier to take them on than to run around.
Found them!
Suit yourself. Die at your own expense.
I won't die.
I can't die. Not here.
Neither can I, idiot.
They're just kids. Finish them off.
Damn.
To-on, tan-tan
To-on, tan-tan
To-on, tan-tan
He's gone mad.
He's a monster.
What is this?
Get him! Now!
What's wrong?
-Can't breathe. -Can't breathe?
It's a woman.
How dare you, bitch!
Get away, Kyoukai! Get up.
You…
Hurry.
Run, Kyoukai.
I will.
With you.
You idiot!
Fools.
They jumped to their deaths.
Don't move.
You hit your head.
We made it.
Just barely.
Did you do this?
I guess.
Who are you really, Kyoukai?
What's a girl doing here?
Why so powerful?
I'm not telling.
I saved you from that spear.
It hurts.
My side hurts like crazy.
Shut up.
I'll answer one question.
Fine.
Why are you…?
Forget it.
What's a girl doing on a battlefield?
To avenge someone.
Avenge?
Who?
So, tell me. Who is it?
She was a sister to me.
To avenge Kyosho.
She meant more to me than my life.
So, is this killer among us?
On this battlefield?
No.
In Wei.
But I don't know how to get there.
You're going to Wei just for her?
She means my life.
How dare you.
So, are you saying you can't die…
until you destroy the man who killed her?
It's not a man.
What?
It's a woman from our clan.
We're all women.
All women?
Forget it. Leave me alone.
How could I?
Your eyes.
They look so sad.
They are called the Tribe of Sorrow.
It is said that it took only one of them to destroy a small state.
A legendary assassin clan with extraordinary powers.
Shiyuu.
Why do you know us?
Who are you?
I'm Shin.
Your friend from the same squad.
You're no friend.
I lost my best friend too.
He was a brother to me. Hyou, right?
I heard you talking to Bihei.
We're the same because you lost some friend?
That's right.
We're different.
You know nothing about us.
Then, tell me. How is it different?
Who are you people?
We're a cursed tribe.
As children,
we train in the mountains to become assassins.
When a successor is needed,
candidates for the next Shiyuu are sent from each tribe.
We kill each other until the last one is standing.
The sole survivor can claim to be Shiyuu
and leave the mountains.
Yuren.
Gakyo.
They're tough opponents.
Sword Ryokusui…
protect Kyoukai for me.
Kyosho.
Kyoukai.
You know,
I've always thought of you as my own sister.
Me too, Kyosho.
But when tomorrow comes, we must both fight for ourselves.
Even if it means confronting each other.
Don't worry.
You'll be the survivor.
If so, that means you're going to die tomorrow.
So be it.
But Kyoukai, I don't want you to die tomorrow.
It can't be helped.
Only one survives. That's the rule.
Only one survives. That's the rule. I know that.
I do.
To tell you the truth, I want to live.
There's so much I want to do.
Like what?
Know men.
Men?
You're too young.
I want to leave the mountains and see what our state is like.
And the people who live there.
More than that…
Give it all from the start.
Attack the strongest.
Kyosho will do the rest.
She will be Shiyuu and venture out into the world.
It's okay, Ryokusui.
My mind is set.
Now, rest.
Sleeping incense.
Kyosho!
Kyosho?
Thank God.
She won.
No.
Kyosho.
It's not that she was weak.
Kyosho was targeted because she was strong.
It was all Yuren's doing.
So, she's the one you're after.
That's right.
My life exists…
only to kill this woman.
And then what?
I will join Kyosho.
No way.
I won't let you.
You're wrong.
How?
I don't know.
But after you hunt down this enemy, with those sad eyes,
you're going to die too?
What's it to you?
Everything.
To hell with your reason for not dying.
Idiot.
I'll be the greatest general on earth.
It was Hyou's dream too.
I promised Hyou.
That's why I can't die until I rise to the top.
Because then, I'm sure Hyou will be smiling.
That's my reason.
Kyoukai.
How would Kyosho feel…
if you died after taking revenge?
You think she'd be happy?
But…
That's all I can do.
What was her dream?
I don't remember.
She must've had one.
Hold on to it.
Then, you won't be so sad.
It's sunrise.
The enemy will find us.
We're doomed.
Hey!
Hey!
What?
-There you are. -Shin.
Shin.
You're alive.
You're safe.
What a relief.
Not really. We're still in trouble.
Here.
-Oh, Kyoukai. -Kyoukai.
-Good to see you both. -Yeah.
You're…
A woman?
Today will be our victory.
Our chariot units have destroyed most of the troops at the enemy line.
The Qin Army no longer have the power to resist.
-Call out our 3rd Battalion. -Yes, sir.
All forces, get ready to charge.
Commander Kyuugen's battalion has headed for enemy headquarters.
Wei's main forces are coming.
Pick up your weapons and get back in line.
Damn, they're coming straight for General Hyouko's camp.
No orders yet?
Not yet.
The 4th Army Cavalry.
Defensive formation!
Looks like we've started to fight Wei's main forces.
The place we're at is between their armies
and their headquarters on the hill.
We're completely isolated from our army.
How many of us are here?
Approximately 30 men.
Better run.
To the plains.
No.
How about we attack instead?
What?
Hey, brat, where the hell do we attack?
Right there.
Garrisons.
We're seen.
You said it'd work out, Shin.
Let's go!
Reporting.
Thirty surviving enemies are coming up the hill.
Just 30 men?
Up this hill?
They must be a bunch of imbeciles.
Leave them be.
Our 2,000 garrisons will deal with them.
More importantly…
our aim is to take Hyouko's head.
Our frontline was destroyed by Kyuugen's army.
General Hyouko, we must retreat.
The 4th Army's 30 survivors have reached the foot of Kyuugen's hill.
Just 30?
That's too few.
It's a matter of time before they perish.
Interesting.
General Hyouko.
A subtle flame.
However,
amongst our 4th Army, there is one subtle flame that stands out.
There's always something special about them.
A single action will move 10 and 1,000 and hold the power to devastate 10,000.
This subtle flame will gather and become a big flame
and turn the tide of war.
That's what war is all about, my men.
Yes, sir.
My orders.
Sir.
To the 4th Army's battlefield.
All forces.
Charge!
Yes, sir.
To the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Cavalry units.
Assemble at the 4th Army's battlefield.
To the 4th Army's cavalry.
Stop the enemy's battalion.
Join the 4th Army.
Orders to attack. Finally.
Charge!
Bakukoshin. Their battalion is too big for us.
Split into two.
We're not confronting them.
General Hyouko's true aim is to turn the tide of war.
We shall penetrate the enemy front
and go for Kyuugen on the hill.
That's absurd. You'll die in vain.
Help is here!
Heki, there's no turning back.
Dammit.
Heki Army, we will support Bakukoshin's men.
Go straight for the center.
Follow me.
Let go!
-Bro. -Dammit.
Way too many.
They're just a garrison.
Bakukoshin Army, charge.
Wipe out Wei's garrisons.
Garrisons, retreat to the forest. We will recover our positions.
It's Commander Bakukoshin.
He came through.
We're saved.
We're saved at last.
They'll do the rest.
Nothing's over yet.
Survivors of the chariots.
You are the pride of the Bakukoshin Army.
If you've survived the jaws of death, I'm sure you'll survive the next one.
As of now,
our army will go up the hill and take Kyuugen's head.
This is a nightmare. I thought we were saved.
Now you're talking.
Our squad is full of crazies.
Remember, this battle will lead us to the victory of Qin.
Soldiers, follow the cavalry.
The wounded will be left behind, so be prepared!
We can't get through them all.
There's no need to confront them.
Just run through.
Hey, you've become chatty all of a sudden.
I can't die. Not here.
Right.
Okay, guys.
Prepare to charge!
You're no commander!
Hey, look.
An enemy attack?
Cavalry units?
They've come through.
Enemy attack.
They're everywhere.
This is crazy.
Never mind the numbers. Penetrate.
Keep slaying the enemy before you and you'll get through.
Clever.
It's still crazy!
Stop them!
They're too strong.
We won't last.
Bitou.
Now!
Follow Shin.
Passing through.
Are you okay?
Soldiers, stay here. Our cavalry will go uphill.
Hey.
Without the cavalry, they'll die.
We're equally facing death.
All for victory. That's what we're about.
You come with us.
We could use you.
Go, Shin.
You're cut out for more than our tiny squad.
The greatest general on earth, right?
Kyoukai.
Take care of them.
Don't want to.
Harsh.
Don't say that. Bye.
See you at the top.
Yeah.
Go!
Take Kyuugen's head and we'll turn the tide of war.
We shall drag Gokei out of his camp.
There's no end.
Bitou!
I'm Shin.
Your friend from the same squad.
Thanks, Kyoukai.
But go help my brother first.
Looks like he hurt his leg.
What was her dream?
She must've had one.
Hold on to it.
Then, you won't be so sad.
Get up and run. I can't.
I can't move.
Don't mind me. You have to help my brother.
Please.
That brother of yours sent me.
Kyoukai.
Enough. I'm done.
I'll die here.
You run and live.
I want to live. There's so much I want to do.
Like what?
I want to leave the mountains and see what our state is like.
And the people who live there.
More than that…
I want to laugh until my sides hurt.
What's that supposed to mean, Kyosho?
Kyoukai?
Just to laugh?
Go, Kyoukai!
Get up. We're going.
I said I can't.
You can.
You're still alive.
All right.
Bro, are you okay?
Yeah.
Let's go.
I'll guard your backs.
We'll make it to the top.
Go.
See you there.
Their headquarters.
Commander.
The enemy's cavalry is heading this way.
Kourigen.
Leave it to me, sir.
Kourigen Archer Unit.
Ready.
Shoot.
We have the commander.
They're just arrows.
We're almost there.
Shoot.
You okay?
I cannot die here.
Right.
Let's finish them.
Impossible. Did he see my arrow?
Commander, please, evacuate.
Do not panic.
Only luck got them here.
It's not luck.
If it weren't for our dead comrades…
I wouldn't be here.
You fool.
If you don't kill me, your comrades will have died in vain.
Commander.
You've come too close to a blind man.
Now, who's the real fool?
Adjutant Commander Kyuugen…
I got you!
Commander.
Retreat. All of you.
Retreat. Now!
Go on.
Heki, look.
There's our flag on the hill.
Qin's flag is on Kyuugen's hill.
Thanks to your bravery, Commander.
But the garrisons on the hillside are coming.
They have 1,000 men, we have ten.
I'm afraid we must take Kyuugen's head and go down the hill.
Are you kidding?
Go down for all I care. I'm staying.
How dare you.
Mind your language, soldier.
Commander Bakukoshin said…
we're here thanks to our dead comrades.
We can't give it up.
Just because 1,000 men are coming after us?
Kid.
Your name?
I'm Shin.
Listen, Shin.
Bravery and recklessness are completely different things.
If you don't understand that…
you'll die too soon, with nothing in your hands.
Now…
the tide of war will turn.
Go down the hill with them.
For our dead comrades.
You must keep on going.
For our victory.
Commander Bakukoshin.
Commander Koshin!
Commander Koshin!
Shin!
Guys.
You're alive!
I said…
Thanks to Kyoukai.
She had our backs.
She wore herself out guarding us.
I appreciate it, Kyoukai.
They're coming.
We will take Kyuugen's head
and go down the hill from the other side.
What about our commander?
We'll take him with us.
Go.
How can we leave him?
Let me help.
-You secure the way. -Right.
Impossible.
Where did they come from?
Over there.
Wei's hill camp has disappeared.
Their general made a move?
Darn.
We made it all the way up, just to get killed from both sides.
Twice the size of Kyuugen's army.
Wei's Fire Dragon, Gokei.
Gokei is said to have over 100 war strategies.
But Military Chief Shouheikun
is out on an expedition with Chancellor Ryofui.
Our city of Xianyang is in need of a strategist like theirs.
What?
What is it?
We received news of…
a certain army…
heading towards the Dakan Plains.
Who is it?
It's the man…
who had stayed away from war.
It can't be.
Why is he here?
Is it really him?
Yes, sir.
He was seen going up the first hill, leading 500 men.
Only 500 men?
What is he thinking?
Run to a safer spot.
People.
Leaving so soon?
The fun's just getting started.
General Ouki…
Shin, my boy.
Our paths have crossed again.
You.
You stood out even from afar.
Impressed, huh?
However,
you're far from becoming the greatest general on earth.
To be blunt, you've turned out to be a disappointment.
Disappointment?
Exactly.
You're saying I'm weak?
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm afraid your vigor precedes you.
Don't you get it?
You've been standing in the face of death all this time.
Please, forgive his manners, General Ouki.
General.
You are a godsend to arrive before us.
Please, lead us and the 4th Army.
I decline.
But General…
We don't have permission to join you.
We'd get a scolding if we did.
You see,
I've just come up to enjoy the view.
Right, Tou?
Yes, General, the view is exquisite.
Behold.
The moment the tide of war turns.
Having a meticulous eye for subtle changes,
cautious, and yet bold in action,
General Gokei is undoubtedly
a threat to the neighboring states.
He's the best strategist in Wei.
But in war,
clever strategy is not enough.
Sometimes,
intuitive instincts will exceed everything else.
Instincts?
There.
Our instinctual general is charging toward the strategic Gokei.
That was fast.
Our commander-in-chief,
General Hyouko.
Shin, my boy.
How about we make a bet?
Will strategy win?
Or instincts?
Awesome.
Now,
how will Gokei receive him?
Reporting.
Hyouko has broken through our 1st Battalion.
Grind them down.
Chariots.
Our cavalry at the back is being attacked.
As expected of Gokei.
It was a surprise attack,
but he's dealing with it swiftly and accurately.
One does not need to aim for the head in order to stop a raging bull.
Yes, it's an ironclad rule to slow down an advance.
You're right. Hyouko's army has slowed down.
Was the charge in vain?
Up until now,
Hyouko has used his army in a reckless manner.
But as a result, Kyuugen is killed
and Gokei is lured down the hill to come face-to-face with Hyouko.
In other words, as General Hyouko would put it,
what seemed like a reckless battle was indeed a holy sacrifice
for the sake of victory.
But that means…
Get the picture?
Shin, my boy.
All the sacrifices made up until now were for this moment.
For both commanders-in-chief to win their victories.
Just the two…
creating a big war.
Shin, my boy.
That's…
what generals are all about.
Generals.
The greatest general on earth.
General Ouki, lend me your horse.
Please.
Tou.
Yes, sir.
Thanks.
Hey.
Later.
This guy.
He's gone.
You seem to have taken a liking to that boy, General.
That kind of fool usually ends up hurrying to his death.
True, but very rarely,
they are destined for more.
A peasant soldier from the left.
Surround him.
Draw closer.
Knock him down.
Surround him.
Get him.
I'll go straight for Gokei.
Go.
Hyouko is coming. Don't fret. Prepare for battle.
Don't fret. Prepare for battle.
Yes, sir.
General, please, retreat for now.
Ouki.
I see.
That's why we can't quit the business of war.
Gokei.
We meet at last.
Men, do not interfere.
You're not a cold schemer
but a compassionate man.
The battle of great generals.
I, Gokei…
am a royal prince from a small state destroyed by Qin.
I will avenge my family.
My only wish is to destroy Qin that robbed us.
I have come to Wei
and made myself a great general.
I see.
So, that's what you fight for.
States get crushed all the time during war.
The bitterness you experienced
.is lying everywhere.
Exactly.
That's why wars never end.
Five hundred years of war may lead to 500 more years of war.
My sword will stop that, so no one dies.
I will be…
the first emperor to unify our world.
Vengeance is mine.
Bring it on, Gokei.
It's been quite a while.
General Hyouko.
Oh, there you are, Ouki.
Your glare from the top of the hill helped me considerably.
Well…
I was just passing by when I came across your battle.
How great of you to defeat the Fire Dragon.
To victory!
The death of Gokei destroyed the Wei Army's morale.
Without their general,
they had no choice but to retreat.
An all-out confrontation was avoided,
and the Qin Army was able to minimize the damage.
Shin! Shin!
Hey, Shin!
There you are.
-You in one piece? -Yep.
It's over.
What a relief.
We're going home.
We're finally done.
That was so long.
Come to Asui with me.
Let's drink to our victory.
I'm afraid…
I have some business to attend to.
I'm drinking.
Kyoukai.
Wait.
Are you going?
To avenge Kyosho?
Go after you have some fun with us.
Enjoy our victory.
No.
I will follow the Wei Army.
Because you don't know how to get there?
Shut up.
Don't you think you're lucky…
to have met us at war?
How so?
You look better.
Your eyes look different.
You're mistaken.
Maybe.
On the contrary.
I helped you considerably.
You're right.
I've got a lot to learn.
I need more training to become the greatest general on earth.
Training?
That's right.
The generals made me think.
If I really want to unify China with King Eisei…
I need more training.
I'll be a better warrior.
So, come back to us.
Kyoukai.
You're one of us now.
Come back, and let's fight together again.
We'll make a toast.
Then, we'll have fun and laugh until our sides hurt.
So long.
So long.
Shin.
Hey.
What's the matter?
Were you worried I died?
Never.
By the way,
I hope you achieved something.
Sure thing.
Good. Nice work.
Right.
You made it back.
Yeah.
Shin.
I decided while you were gone…
I'm going to war.
What?
You'll get killed on the spot.
Not with swords but with my brains.
I'll assist your stupidity with my brains.
They're called,
"Strategists."
Suit yourself.
I can hardly wait.
Shin, a commander?
That's right. As a reward for his services.
A slave can become a 100-Man Commander in one war?
A fast promotion.
But the officers at war recommended him.
I see.
Now, for our own war.
Shi Shi.
I appreciate you joining forces with us.
The real battle is yet to come.
Your Majesty.
We have looked into the attempted assassination.
The one who led the intruders inside
seems to be among us.
The only man capable of this…
is him.
Ryofui.
Reporting.
Chancellor Ryofui has arrived.
Lord Shou Hei Kun and Mobu wish
to see Your Majesty.
-Show them in. -Yes!
CHANCELLOR - RYOFUI
Congratulations.
Our people are thrilled about the victory at the Dakan Plains.
Yes.
Thanks to our soldiers.
By the way,
I heard there was an incident at the palace.
Some intruders tried to assassinate Your Majesty.
Merely rumors, I presume.
It was a confidential matter. How do you know about this?
Because…
I am the one behind it.
He confessed.
You cannot fool me, Chancellor.
That's not possible.
A joke, indeed.
I just wanted to break the ice, as it were.
Forgive me.
Unbelievable.
We cannot capture them, even if they come to us.
That's how powerful they are.
Be patient for now.
About this incident…
I will make sure
my trusted confidants look into it.
I'm counting on you.
I'll owe you, En.
I have orders from Commander Heki to support you.
Don't worry.
That's General Ouki's castle.
Right.
By the way,
why did you come here?
I'm going to be trained…
by General Ouki.
Just you wait.
ORIGINAL STORY BY YASUHISA HARA
ENGRAVED MEMORIES
We'll definitely see each other again.
Most definitely.
THE STRONGEST MAN IS CONFRONTED BY
[news reporter 1, in German] A huge underground bunker became home to international criminal businesses.
[news reporter 2] Six hundred and fifty police officers were deployed,
including special tactical units.
[police officer 1] Target 200 meters ahead.
[news reporter 3] The main suspect is a 59-year-old man from the Netherlands.
[news reporter 4, in English] A darknet guru called Herman Xennt.
[news reporter 5] He's like your 007 James Bond typical villain.
-[dramatic music playing] -[police officer 1, in German] Go, go, go.
-Team one, advancing. -[police officer 2] No one.
[police officer 1] Advancing.
[police officer 1] Team one has reached lower floor.
[police officer 2] Team one, come in, please.
Radio connection is bad.
[Xennt] I am sure that people like me will have a big impact on the future internet.
[Xennt] The problem, however, is whether humanity is ready.
[interviewer] Do you want to make the world a better place?
Yes, of course.
Next question, please.
[interviewer] Do you see yourself as a criminal?
No, not really.
[news reporter 1] A data center exclusively for criminal businesses worth millions.
[in English] It's called Cyberbunker. Cyberbunker is a web hosting service.
[news reporter 2, in German] At the center of this thriller is a bunker that once belonged to the Bundeswehr.
[news reporter 3] In the middle of Germany, near Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle,
the cybercriminals operated their international business.
An extraordinary blow against cybercrime.
Drugs and forged documents.
[news reporter 4, in English] Illegal drugs, selling weapons.
The biggest cyberattack…
In internet history.
[Ed] These guys started out being idealists,
they ended up being more and more tarnished.
[Ed] What is happening in this bunker?
So, um, hello everybody.
I'm Kevin and I am one of the dukes of Cyberbunker.
Uh, my official title is Minister of Propaganda.
[in German] I'm Michiel and I was the manager of Cyberbunker.
[Sven, in English] We can't do it on the record without the titles.
It doesn't have to be all the titles,
but at least it has to have the prince in there.
I'm Prince Sven Olaf of Cyberbunker Kamphuis,
Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Telecommunication, Transport, and most recently also War.
Um, I'm the vice head of state of the Republic Cyberbunker,
now acting head of state.
So, yep.
[Michiel, in German] If I was to go back there now,
to right before the first visit to Traben-Trarbach, then I would have said…
"Don't go there, because…
it can't end well."
[Patrice] Life in Traben-Trarbach is usually peaceful.
We don't have the hustle and bustle of a big city.
It's quite soothing for the soul.
But if I were to be asked about the bunker,
what it is, I would have just said,
"It's the worst thing that could possibly happen here."
[Bärbel] The bunker everyone is talking about is located on a mountain.
You can see an antenna, a fence, and nothing else.
A green site.
[Patrice] From 2012, the bunker was empty.
And a buyer was then sought.
[Winfried] Until the news came in 2013 it had been sold.
As a local journalist, of course, you want to know.
Who's the buyer and what do they want to do with it?
I did some research
and it turned out that he was a somewhat dubious character in the online world.
The name I was given was Herman Johan Xennt.
[Hajo] There were many stories swirling around him.
He had very long, blond hair. He always wore a long coat.
But he showed up here as a businessman.
In 2013, during a regular city council meeting,
Xennt presented his project.
He explained that he needed a bunker…
BUNKER FLOOR PLAN
[Hajo] …that he was Dutch, and had done this before.
"We need the rooms for our employees, for the IT people."
"And it'll grow over time."
He then created what we now call a cloud, or a data center, there.
And at the time, of course, we thought it sounded exciting.
Silicon Valley, Traben-Trarbach, exactly. [chuckles]
Only smaller, why not?
PURCHASE CONTRACT
[Patrice] But there wasn't jubilation in the council that a buyer had been found.
As the city council, we couldn't prevent it anyway.
There were mixed feelings about it.
You just heard trucks going in and out at night.
He had to get his equipment into the bunker somehow, of course.
But, initially, it was sort of intangible.
[Hajo] There was also a bit of Googling done in city hall.
"Who is this guy? Where did he come from?"
And there was some information already out there.
He already had skeletons in his closet. There was something there.
[Jörg] I'm Jörg Angerer, Senior Public Prosecutor,
and I worked on the Cyberbunker case.
In 2013, I was called by the Office of Criminal Investigation,
who told me that Traben-Trarbach's municipal mayor
had got in touch to say
that someone wanted to move into a former NATO bunker
that was being sold,
and that he had already been involved in shady business in Holland.
That was the initial tip.
[Tim] I'm Tim Henkel.
I'm a cybercrime investigator for Rhineland-Pfalz Criminal Police.
I'd just completed training and was taking my first steps as a police officer.
It all started in 2013.
My supervisor back then informed me that there was a case there
and asked me if I'd be interested in taking part in this operation,
which I thought was extremely exciting and I was very excited, of course.
We first conducted online investigations into this Dutchman,
into his past…
and first did some research into who we were dealing with.
[Kevin] Xennt is a very huge part of Cyberbunker.
He was the head behind this.
It was born actually in Cyberbunker One in the Netherlands
where we had our first bunker.
[in Dutch] Well, this is the bunker.
If you come in with me quickly…
then I can also show you the inside.
[in English] First time I've met Xennt, I think it was above ground actually.
[in Dutch] So, this is the rear entrance.
You can see the spacious entrance with two diesel air vent filters.
[in English] It's kind of like a cross-mixture between Steve Jobs and um…
the guy from Star Trek. Yeah.
[in German] He had this fascination for bunkers.
[in Dutch] So, I think if this videotape continues as it is,
bad bits like this shot will be cut out.
We'll only keep the good bits and then you'll see
the progress of the renovation of a bunker, a small nuclear bunker,
into a bunker with a…
classy appearance,
which makes you think you're in a space station or something.
So, there you have it.
You're welcome to keep looking around.
[Guido, in English] Well, my name is Guido Blaauw
[Guido, in English] Well, my name is Guido Blaauw and everything I provide,
everything I say, can and may be used in the documentary.
[Guido] On one hand, Xennt is a very warm person,
a very gentle person, very nice to talk to.
And on the other hand, he is just this hardcore criminal,
making money over everything he can.
[presenter 1] In 1995, some ten million people regularly use the internet.
What's attracted many of them is the World Wide Web.
[Ed] That early period of the internet
was full of this idea that perhaps, you know,
the world was gonna really change for the better because of this new tool.
Nice of you to join us.
[Ed] Xennt understood the internet, kind of right in the core of it.
Understood its possibilities.
This growing world, which was called online,
which was still kind of mysterious to lots of people.
[presenter 2] Anyone with a computer and a modem can join in.
[Ed] Xennt had a store which was just selling computers.
Very early days of personal computers.
[Guido] He made a good amount of money with that.
He bought himself a Lamborghini…
um, and-- and he had money to buy a bunker.
[Guido] When I was in there two hours with him and we came outside,
I said, "Xennt, I'm in love,"
and he said, "Well, I had exactly the same thing
when I visited this bunker for the first time,
I was completely in love."
For some unknowable reason, he loved bunkers.
He and some friends moved in.
There was some work you have to do to…
And that work was under construction when I joined.
[in Dutch] See, there it is, and it works too. Follow me.
[Guido, in English] It was the most ideal and most fantasy-rich
possible location you can imagine.
Paradise.
[Sven] He actually thinks that
you can make a bunker look like a spaceship.
I keep telling him it will never fly away but… [laughs]
Yeah, but, you know, spacey doors. [imitates door opening, closing]
They were programmers, early adopters of the technology,
thinking about the internet in this deep way.
[Martijn] It was like a community of people brought together
from all kinds of backgrounds
using the bunker as a kind of center of gravity for…
you know, doing weird and funny stuff on the internet.
[Guido] It was a group of friends,
a bunch of hackers having the best time of their lives.
[Sven] The internet, back in those days,
you could just do whatever you want.
You also could not call the police
if something happened that you didn't want to happen
because the police simply didn't understand any of it.
But the internet had to be paid somehow.
What paid for the internet?
-Porn. [laughs] -[ominous music playing]
[Ed] They had a bunch of servers, they were hosting porn websites.
All websites have to be physically hosted somewhere
on a computer or on a server.
And that's what hosting is, you're giving a home to a website.
[Guido] If you have a few porn hosters in your data center,
it's a cash cow because it generates so much traffic
and that's what a data center gets its money from.
[Ed] At some point, they named this company Cyberbunker.
[Guido] That was always his… his dream.
It's a very nice location.
It was a very nice location.
It's ruins.
[Sven] They were shouting, "The bunker is on fire,"
and I'm like, "Nah."
"Nah, bunkers can't burn."
[Ed] The emergency services were called and what they found
in the wake of that fire was a burnt-out ecstasy lab.
What the hell is going on?
You know, is this guy involved in illegal stuff?
[Ed] At a certain point,
presumably to make some extra money,
Xennt sublet a portion of the bunker to another group.
Xennt said that he knew nothing about what was going on.
He had simply sublet the space and what they did was their own business.
And eventually the police had no choice but to accept his version of events.
[Sven] We could basically throw away everything
that was in there.
That was a bit of a problem. Yeah.
[Martijn] There was a bunker burned down.
He was not capable of building it up again.
Several people chasing him for the fact that he owed them money.
He needed to move on. He needed to find a new identity.
And that's what he found in Germany, in new Cyberbunker, his new kingdom.
[Martijn] It made me realize that Xennt was still doing what he was doing before,
that he was involved with things
that you would normally not show to the outer world.
And that needed to be stopped.
[Martijn] So, my name is Martijn Burger.
I've been in the internet business of things
for quite a long time.
As a business partner of Xennt, I worked closely together with him.
I was probably the right person to help him
to achieve a structured organization.
It was not like a thing I was used to in a corporate structure,
in a company structure, you know, it was like…
a zoo… [chuckles] …to be honest.
At a certain moment in time,
Xennt was saying, "Martijn, I throw you out."
And that's what more or less triggered my reaction.
I started investigating him,
the organizations, and the people surrounding him,
because I felt that some things were not correct.
I reached out to the authorities
and tried to make them interested,
aware that they should further investigate this
and get into the details of what they were doing.
[Tim, in German] We believed that Xennt fled the Netherlands
to evade the threat of prosecution there.
At that time, it was clear to us
he was doing the same thing here as he'd done in the Netherlands.
That was the start of our investigation.
At the start, we used classic observation in order to gain insights.
I don't believe that the group were explicitly aware
that investigations against them were underway.
[in English] Yeah, we knew we were observated, but then again
everyone spies.
[in German] I'm just trying to think of the best adjective to describe it.
The observation at the bunker site was not successful.
[Jörg] We were not sure exactly what was in the bunker.
The facility is huge and we couldn't get to it.
[automated voice as Xennt, in English] "I am a creator,
not a consumer."
"I will make the world a better place to live in."
"I have more ideas
that I can possibly realize in this lifetime."
"Anyone who like to share ideas
or wants to join me in one or more project
is welcome to contact me."
[in German] The people who came to Cyberbunker
were searching for something.
[in English] There was a time where I was having a really tough time
with my relationship back then, and my workplace was about to stop.
The first time I entered the site, I was astonished by the scale of the base.
They showed me around.
I got a room there to stay in.
Then the question arose, "Would you like to join the team?"
And then I said, "Yeah, of course."
I was happy to do so.
[in German] There was a sort of world there, that you could only imagine
if you let your imagination run wild and read about something like it.
But it was there, it was real.
Xennt gave you a sense that something special was being built there.
He had this aura of a visionary, his ideas were good.
He wanted to start a software development center.
This is a huge project going on here.
It's really big. A bit like a mini Silicon Valley.
[Kevin, in English] The main bunker itself, it's huge.
It consists of five different floors.
We have the first level
where we had our electronics lab and a little kitchen.
In the second level, we all had our offices
for our day-to-day businesses.
On the third level was the server level.
On the fourth level, you would have power and air,
and then you had a fifth level, and that was just utilities.
When you are above ground, the world can kind of disturb you.
But the moment when you enter the bunker and you go around the corner,
the only people that can talk to you or disturb you
are the people that are inside of the bunker.
[Michiel, in German] You feel like you're locked in.
That's when you experience this silence.
[Michiel] And then, you immediately also realize that true silence doesn't exist.
Because you hear your blood rushing.
[Kevin, in English] It was a very beautiful place to come to your senses and to work in.
[Michiel, in German] You felt very secure there, very comfortable.
Work was good, living was good, I felt very at home.
[Kevin, in English] We always had breakfast together and we always had supper together.
It took some time for people to get to know you and to accept you.
But when that happened we had each other's backs.
[Michiel, in German] Most of the time, everything was relaxed. There was laughter, joking around.
[Ed, in English] They were living there. It wasn't just where they worked.
This was a key part of their identity. They were in the bunker.
[Kevin] It was a real open atmosphere
that was really welcoming and then warming.
A real digital playground.
[Michiel, in German] It was as though everyone had their own vision, their own idea, and then joined together.
their own idea, and then joined together.
[Kevin, in English] Cyberbunker just goes out of the ideal that the internet is a free place.
Freedom of the internet.
The reason why we did hosting at Cyberbunker was to give people a place
to safely store their data and their servers.
We will provide you with a server.
[Kevin] And it's up to you to do with the server what you want.
[Bärbel, in German] Mr. Xennt had an appointment and came into the salon.
He looked very fresh, very young.
He looked good.
Maybe it was his leather coat, but I thought…
he's from another planet. He's different.
Then he chose a very light blond, a cool blond,
and that's what he got.
He was silent and stared at the floor.
And I felt that it was a negative silence and was actually very happy
when this gentleman left.
The bunker crew, sometimes it felt as if a pirate ship was docking here,
the whole pirate crew ran through the village, amusing themselves…
[chuckles] …then were suddenly gone again and casted off.
You just wondered,
what's going on up there?
[Patrice] You didn't know who was up there. What is he actually doing?
You didn't hear or see anything, or know what was going on.
But there were rumors.
Maybe he's growing some kind of drugs up there?
[Patrice] The other thing was his dogs,
which ran free all day long and annoyed the community.
That was the final straw for me,
so I said, "No matter what, I'm calling Mr. Xennt."
[Patrice] He was surprised, but he said, "No problem, come on over."
He said, "Give me 15 minutes to rein the dogs in,
but then come on over. No problem."
That was a positive starting point.
We went up there. Mr. Xennt greeted us quite normally,
the atmosphere was very open.
Then he told us who he is, what he does.
We said you can look around anywhere you want.
Everything was open.
[Patrice] Then we just went down, level by level,
and he said, "Open every door, I have nothing to hide."
I was relieved that the premises weren't being used for anything suspicious
and that we didn't find a hemp plantation.
And suddenly you came into a room that was really black.
[Patrice] Very cold, very austere.
It was definitely a bit strange.
What struck you immediately was that there were no windows, of course.
You're practically floating in time and space.
It was a very different atmosphere in there.
Yeah, very unusual for me.
[Tim] Of course, it wouldn't have helped if we'd rung Cyberbunker's doorbell and asked,
"Mr. Xennt, can you show us what's here and what you're up to?"
That is where protecting the case comes first and takes priority.
For us, it was very important to stay out of sight
and ensure they didn't realize we were conducting an investigation.
[Tim] Telephone surveillance is a very intensive measure.
You enter the other person's day-to-day life.
BUNKER AREA? MONEY HANDOVER
The group is very secretive, and, of course, we had to find ways
to get information from the inner circle.
-[Mr. Green, in English] Hello? -[caller 1] Hello.
[Mr. Green] Yeah. The suits. Were the suits all right?
[caller 1] Yeah, they're perfect and fit.
You know, they're these special fabrics.
They can change color when exposed to sunlight,
so you have to check how good they are.
[Mr. Green] That's no problem.
[caller 1] We have to talk about behavior.
[Tim, in German] The Cyberbunker group spoke in a very coded way.
For example, "boxes of oranges," or various types of furniture.
It was colors of ships, it was suits of various changing colors.
[Mr. Green, in English] Hello. I just found the oranges. Tell me more.
[caller 1] So, this happened.
He received 700 boxes of oranges, and they are at the right place.
And now he needs 350 more to make full charge.
[Jörg, in German] So, when people make these kinds of phone calls,
it's clear something is up. That's not how people talk.
The codification of language and terminology.
which was revealed through the telephone surveillance,
created big problems for us.
Ultimately, we couldn't identify crimes through telephone surveillance,
but the gang's structure became clear.
It started with the leadership team around Xennt and the manager, Rugers.
Then there were IT workers who worked in the bunker.
Then there were IT workers who worked in the bunker. There was a guard, who also cooked for the staff.
There was a guard, who also cooked for the staff.
It was clear that Mr. Xennt gave orders and others did what he said,
but the role of the others wasn't 100% clear at the beginning.
[Tim] However, for us, the key was the servers.
"What is on these servers?"
"What data is going in and out of there?"
[Martin] With Cyberbunker, the advantage was that cybercriminals felt safe.
When you went onto Cyberbunker, it was pretty clear what it was for.
It had a picture of a bunker.
Which I assumed was total bull, if I'm honest, I didn't think it was real.
There was an FBI raid team on it, trying to get into that bunker.
Cyberbunker was known in the scene as a so-called "bulletproof hoster."
Bulletproof hosting,
that means, no matter what happens, the servers stay online.
[in English] What made Cyberbunker different from other service providers
is the fact that we guaranteed privacy.
[in German] Cyberbunker was really the place to go
for anyone in the scene
who wanted to host questionable or illegal content.
The bunker specifically advertised that it hosts everything,
except child pornography and terrorism.
This made you think, whoever advertises in that way
isn't looking for legal customers.
[in English] We simply do not know ourselves
what the clients are doing with our servers.
[in German] Xennt always said we're doing nothing wrong, everything is legal.
[in English] Michiel comes up to me. "Yeah, we are this internet provider
and we have customers that are all banks and lawyers."
Right, Michiel. [laughs]
[Martijn] It was a kind of fantasy world that Xennt created.
Where he pulled them in.
He was very good in selling his story and creating a kind of overall enthusiasm.
He was a huge fan of freedom of speech.
He wanted to give back the internet to the people, the world.
[Ed] They believed the internet allowed people to have greater freedoms
than perhaps existed in the real world.
I don't think that all of them shared a whole world view.
Certainly, Sven Kamphuis was more extreme than the others.
He's a strange character.
The Republic of Cyberbunker was an idea that was written down and is wild.
[Sven] Cyberbunker is the most technologically advanced
and one of the richest countries in the world. [laughs]
We actually declared independence.
[Guido] Sven just said, "Okay, the Cyberbunker is NATO ground."
"There is no NATO anymore, it's our ground,
so we now have the Republic of Cyberbunker."
We don't want to be on your map. We have our own society.
We have our own rules, we have our own laws, we have our own everything.
It's hilarious that, you know, they declare their own king.
[Guido] Xennt is the king of Cyberbunker. Sven is the prince of Cyberbunker.
The king is also the president, and the crown prince, which is me,
is also the vice head of state, aka the vice president.
[Guido] Sven said, "I will create passports."
He even drove around with number plates.
It was a country in a country.
It's half playful and half serious.
[Guido] It was all created by Sven.
It was all fantasy.
So, no one took it seriously.
[interviewer] What is your title?
Uh, my title is Duke of Cyberbunker and Minister of Propaganda.
I think that's it. Yes, member of government,
but that's evidentially.
The best country in the world. [laughs]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[Guido] Sven, he looks like a chaotic weirdo.
But if he wants, he can shut up the internet.
Really. If he wants.
He did some very rare and stupid things on the internet.
He's capable of doing that.
He knows his way to intrude into a company server.
He's that kind of guy.
[news reporter 1] Has your internet seemed sluggish?
[news reporter 2] The war that's slowing everything down, including Netflix.
If you're thinking the internet is running a little slowly lately,
you're not imagining it.
The web is in the midst of what's being called
the biggest cyberattack of all time.
[news reporter 4] It usually only takes Shannon Lee a few seconds
to access her movies on Netflix,
but minutes go by and the screen stays black.
It's slowing down connection speeds all across the globe.
But who's behind it?
China? North Korea?
[news reporter 5] It's actually rooted in an argument between two European groups.
Spamhaus, that block spam,
and Cyberbunker, a company that hosts websites.
[news reporter 6] Spamhaus is based in Europe.
They're an internet spam watchdog.
What they do is they create spam data filters.
Cyberbunker were blacklisted by Spamhaus
because Spamhaus said too many of the companies they were hosting
were sending too much of this stuff out.
So, the problem that we have with Spamhaus
is that they try to control parts of the internet.
And with control, let's say,
that they have the power to block your IP addresses.
That site, Spamhaus, has power that it shouldn't have
because the internet should be an open place.
[Guido] So, it was a real pain in the ass for the clients of the Cyberbunker
and Sven was fighting them for it.
[Sven] And then we started to, like,
figure out ways how we could get rid of this problem.
One of the suggestions, obviously, was to just get rid of the guy as a whole,
but, you know, some people just like to play with their food.
We tried to use diplomacy to get them to stop blocking them.
They just said, "No."
And then Cyberbunker said, "Okay, we'll see about that."
And the rest is history.
A battle is waging across the internet.
The biggest cyberattacks…
…in internet history.
[Guido] Sven went just completely berserk.
[news reporter 1] Huge, concentrated data streams were sent out over the internet,
slowing down connections around the world.
Security experts fear that this is just the beginning.
That attack is so big, it's affecting everyone online.
SPAM DISPUTE SLOWS THE INTERNET
The internet, hit with the virtual equivalent of a nuclear bomb.
Some are saying essentially it's attacking the very structure of the internet.
See, this is why you do not get on the bad side of hackers.
I love you hackers. You're wonderful. You're all great. [chuckles nervously]
We can now get in touch with Sven Olaf Kamphuis.
He's a spokesman for Cyberbunker.
Now, you are being accused of this massive cyberattack.
Is somebody gonna be held account? Could somebody go to prison over this?
Could somebody be fined? Is this gonna be resolved?
I doubt that the people that did the attacks
are in any country where doing a DDoS attack is illegal
or where they can even be found. So… [laughs]
Not much issues there.
PIRATE PARTY
[news reporter, in Spanish] Police in Barcelona have arrested a 35-year-old Dutch activist
who was responsible for the largest DDoS cyberattack in history.
The investigation started in March…
[Sven, in English] At that point, I was driving in an orange thing
with all my crap in the back
and then I went to Spain during this entire operation.
[Ed] He was arrested
and he is eventually processed in the Netherlands
under criminal charges.
I was convicted not on a criminal organization
because they couldn't prove
that I was in charge of the operation at any time.
There simply is no law against it.
[laughs] Done.
[Ed] He believes in total freedom.
In his mind, you should be able to do anything on the internet.
But, you know, how that shakes out is,
it means that he's…
you know, seems to espouse for the worst things in the world
to be on the internet.
[interviewer] So, is there anything you wouldn't host?
No, there was not anything I would not host.
The "except for" is something Xennt made up.
Xennt came up with the "except for," I don't have the "except for."
Sven felt above the law, in many ways.
With the knowledge he has, he can be dangerous.
[Tim, in German] We also then reached a point where we said,
"Okay, how can we gather more intelligence now?"
In 2017, we decided to carry out a so-called network node monitoring.
This means we recorded the data center's incoming and outgoing data traffic.
[Jörg] If crimes were committed there, they'd show up in the network traffic.
The intention of the surveillance
was to see what was being done in the bunker.
What data was going in and out? What was illegal and what wasn't?
[Tim] We didn't expect the sheer quantity that we got from our surveillance.
[Tim] We established that on the Cyberbunker servers,
phishing sites were hosted,
large-scale hacker attacks were committed,
narcotics stores were running.
It was the first really effective investigation.
We had clear results, clear sites.
Really potent criminal sites.
None of these criminals could operate their sites,
if they didn't have a hoster to provide servers for them to do so.
You have to realize that there are always real crimes behind it.
[Tim] We determined that, for example, Wall Street Market was hosted there,
the largest darknet market at the time for drugs, weapons, other illegal goods.
[Martin] I'm Martin Frost.
I was one of the operators of Wall Street Market.
This marketplace was one of the largest in the world.
In my opinion, Cyberbunker offered a very professional hosting service,
…to an extent, even better than what I see in the legal sphere.
For us, that was pretty much the reason we went there and stayed.
On Wall Street Market, you found pretty much anything.
Starting with marijuana to MDMA, cocaine or heroin.
The fact that you're far removed from all these events,
from the production process, dealing and things on the streets,
you're really far away from it.
You're just sitting at your computer.
At first, you don't see organized crime, they operate in a different way.
I do believe though that in recent years
organized crime has also increasingly caught on. "Hey."
"These are new distribution channels." And, of course, they use them too.
[caller 1, in English] Hello?
[caller 2] Hello. I'm calling on behalf of Mr. Green.
I mean, George.
George has found a new apartment near Traben-Trarbach.
[caller 1] All right.
[caller 2] Hello. I'm calling on behalf of Mr. Green.
I mean, George.
[caller 1] All right.
[Tim, in German] Then suddenly a whole new name appeared in the telephone surveillance.
[in English] "Mr. Green."
Tallant. Yeah.
My name is Nicola Tallant and I am a crime journalist from Ireland.
Ireland is a place that has been blighted by drugs.
[Nicola] There are a number of gangs.
We've had a number of very significant
murderous feuds over the past few decades.
Mr. Green is actually an alias
and, uh, it's an alias that has been used for quite a long time, um,
but the individual behind it, of course, is George Mitchell AKA The Penguin.
[Nicola] To me, he is the ultimate godfather of crime.
[news reporter] For almost 20 years now, George Mitchell has played a leading role
in running drugs into Ireland and Britain,
but he's also been up to his fat neck in major robberies and arms smuggling.
[Nicola] Within the criminal underworld, he is definitely a feared character.
For 20 years, George Mitchell hadn't been photographed,
he hadn't been seen.
Everybody wanted to track him down,
but he had literally gone into darkness
and we weren't getting very much information about him.
Obviously, we could see that he was still operating.
We knew his networks in Ireland and they were very active.
But any leads we followed had come to nothing.
-And then one day, I got lucky… -[music ends abruptly]
…and a tip came in.
And George Mitchell, I was told, was in, of all places, Germany.
We came upon this town called Traben-Trarbach, in Germany,
which just looked so unlikely.
[Nicola] It's just the last place in the world you'd expect to see,
or to find, a godfather of crime.
We drove around a bit,
drove up to this Cyberbunker place to have a little look.
[Nicola, in car] I don't think we'll be able to use any of this.
I think turn and get out.
It's not worth the risk now.
[Nicola] We had a little look up around the bunker.
[investigator] Can I use that camera for a sec? No, the other camera.
[Nicola] We knew that he was hanging out with Xennt,
but that he didn't like doing that up in the bunker
because he was nervous and claustrophobic when he went in.
So, they were having business meetings,
but they were having them in coffee shops and in restaurants in the town.
The information I had got
was that Mitchell was staying in a waterside apartment,
we didn't know which one.
And when he was in town, most days, they would take a car.
There was a very distinctive registration plate on it.
It was something with BOBO on it.
[investigator] They are gonna pass me here.
[Nicola] A couple of days into the job, sure enough, the BOBO car appeared.
And it pulled up outside an apartment complex.
And this kind of older guy came out,
a man who didn't look as big as I was expecting,
rushed along to the car and got into the back of it.
[Nicola] As the car pulled away,
we looked at the back of the camera,
blew up the image and sure enough, it was George Mitchell.
I was speechless for a while…
uh, and then I was…
Okay, I was absolutely delighted.
I couldn't believe that we'd finally tracked him down.
And once we'd one image of him, we knew where he was,
it was like a playground, Traben-Trarbach.
[Nicola] We wanted to try and get as much as we possibly could.
[Nicola] I had no idea whether he had backup, whether he had spotters working for him,
which is usually the case.
But the more we discretely followed Mitchell,
it appeared he didn't.
It appeared that he just really had Xennt with him.
[Nicola] I wanted to approach him.
I wanted to put a few questions to him
and get up close and personal with him.
We seemed to make our way down the street. And from memory, um,
they came out of this shoe shop.
Yeah, okay, no. Tell them exactly what's happening here.
-[tense music playing] -[George] Okay.
-[Nicola] Hiya. -[George] Hi!
[Nicola] How's it going? George, quick word?
-How are you? -Very good.
[Nicola] Good. Haven't seen you in a long time. Yeah.
[Nicola] You settled in here?
He looked up, and he was sort of surprised.
I think I asked him how he was, or something like that.
He heard the Dublin accent, and he sort of said, for a second,
"I'm grand, I'm grand. Yeah."
And then he just took a minute and he looked in under my baseball cap
and he just went, "Fuck off."
[Nicola] Last time we heard from you, you said you were a legitimate businessman.
Do you want to confirm that?
The gardai in Ireland are still interested in speaking to you,
in relation to drug trafficking.
Have you anything to say about that?
They were going… [chuckles] "…Who is she?"
-Get enough? We've stopped traffic. -[car horns honking]
[Nicola] I don't think Xennt knew what the hell was going on.
I think he was surprised that I knew his name.
-Herman, is it? -What's that, Mädchen?
[Nicola] Is that your name?
[Nicola] To me, he looked like a villain out of a James Bond movie.
In my game,
you've only got a very short window of opportunity
before you push it too far.
We needed to get out of town at that point.
That was it. The job was over.
[Nicola] I was told that this relationship with Herman Xennt dated way back to when Mitchell first arrived in Amsterdam.
dated way back to when Mitchell first arrived in Amsterdam.
I certainly have reporting that suggests that George Mitchell and Xennt
were in contact in the late '90s.
George Mitchell ended up getting arrested for handling stolen computer parts.
Note also that Xennt had a computer business.
[Nicola] I could sort of see connections.
I just presumed George was just the finance man.
I didn't expect that he'd understand the nitty-gritty of it.
[Nicola] Knowing now what we know about the Cyberbunker,
I really do feel that I had only scratched the surface.
I think this story was maybe something that moved
the watching brief by authorities in Germany to a new level.
[Tim, in German] When a person like George Mitchell shows up in a preliminary investigation,
someone with ties to the Irish mafia, who's also linked to homicides there,
who is synonymous with major drugs and arms trafficking,
that, of course, changes the dynamics of the case a lot.
[in English] So, if you put bits and pieces together like the ecstasy lab,
fire, Xennt escaping to Germany,
buying another bunker,
providing data services to external customers…
Irish mobsters being involved…
Sven being involved in DDoS attacks on a global scale,
hosting black markets,
it becomes such a big story,
so many elements,
that you really have to dig deep into it to create a bigger picture.
[Leroy] My name is Leroy Shelton.
I'm a supervisory special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
I've been with the FBI for ten years, all with the Cyber Division.
And in 2017,
I worked the biggest, most sophisticated cyber investigation of my career,
and it involved Cyberbunker.
[Leroy] In the fall of 2017,
we opened an investigation into Wall Street Market.
The 6,500 vendors on that market
sold drugs to 1.1 million users.
[Martin, in German] So, if we're talking about the drug section on Wall Street Market,
there was everything that the market had to offer.
From grass to MDMA, cocaine, and also, fentanyl, for example.
[in English] The painkiller, fentanyl, is now
the number one killer drug in the U.S.
Fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin.
[Juju] The battle against a deadly narcotic.
Fentanyl is taking the opioid epidemic to a new level of urgency.
The connection between fentanyl and opioids in the darknet
can be summed up in two words, which is access and convenience.
You can order your drug of choice on the darknet and it'll be delivered
to your doorstep just like an Amazon product.
Half the deaths from overdoses that we're seeing right now in America
are caused by the synthetic opioid, fentanyl.
It is a significant problem.
As part of my investigation into Wall Street Market
and following the cookie crumbs, I uncovered multiple IP addresses
and learned that they belonged
to the Cyberbunker in Germany belonging to Herman Xennt.
[Martin, in German] The servers are secure.
They have a "no matter what" service.
I was never afraid the authorities would catch us.
[Leroy, in English] We ended up sending a-- what we call a foreign dissemination request to our embassy
a foreign dissemination request to our embassy
to request assistance from the German authorities
and to see if we could get their intrigue on helping us with this investigation.
[Tim, in German] We were often contacted during the investigative process,
including by internationally operating agencies in the USA.
It certainly helps the investigation process
when high-profile players,
like Wall Street Market, are hosted in the data center.
Our approach to the investigation process was to operate with lasting effect.
That doesn't mean achieving quick success by shutting down some narcotics store,
but to take this Cyberbunker offline permanently and to do it with evidence.
But how do we gain access to these servers?
How do we get into this bunker?
[Michiel] On the Cyberbunker website,
there was a special page, a volunteer program
where Cyberbunker was searching for people
who would join the Cyberbunker team on a voluntary basis.
We needed really good people.
[Michiel] Someone responded to the ad.
Harry was a really great guy.
Young, really nice, spontaneous, friendly and decent too.
He said he'd like, um,
to do something, if possible, such as gardening.
[Michiel] That was interesting to Xennt because Harry didn't want to get paid.
He just asked if he could sleep there.
And for Xennt, that was ideal, of course.
[in English] Harry, the gardener, joined multiple times, drinking beers.
[in German] I think everyone liked him.
So, you could almost call it friendship.
[in English] Michiel, a volunteer program.
We used to only get people that we already knew for a couple of years
and then we brought them to the base, blindfolded.
And here comes Michiel, "Oh yeah, let's have a volunteer program."
"Yeah, we're so desperate to get a couple of people in, you know."
Why don't you just ask the NSA if they can send some people over,
maybe they'll bring their own coffee as well. [laughs]
"On his computer screen,
I could see quite a number of shots from surveillance camera installations
throughout the site."
"Next to him, on the desk, was a large machete."
"I asked him about it."
"The guard just smiled and said, 'That's for uninvited guests.'"
[voice actor as agent] "To me, the guard often seemed very aggressive."
"He told me that due to his past, he could smell 'pigs.'"
[interviewer, in German] He couldn't though.
Not this pig anyway.
[Jörg] I certainly think it's careless to openly post job ads
for a criminal bunker.
That's how we got a man into the compound itself.
[voice actor as agent, in English] "Xennt led me behind the bunker personally and showed me where I should start work."
"He said I should plant a few spruces because he'd always really wanted
an evergreen spruce wood."
[Tim, in German] Of course, he has to generate empathy, he has to be able to build trust
and that only works if he's approachable and he acts interested.
[voice actor as agent, in English] "If I enjoyed the work, I'd also be welcome to stay."
"Michiel sent me a message via WhatsApp."
"On Friday evening, we're having a party and it'd be great if you could come."
"Let me know if you can make it, we'd be delighted if you could!"
"You're one of us and it'd be a real shame if you weren't there."
[voice actor as agent] "One evening, there was a barbecue."
"The group sat around the campfire for hours,
and each of them had a laptop in their lap."
[voice actor as agent] "They were working the entire time."
"At least, that's what they said."
[Michiel, in German] It was always nice.
Harry slowly became part of the family.
[Tim] The undercover investigator provided us with valuable information.
For the first time,
we were able to precisely identify who held which role in Cyberbunker.
Who was in charge, what the dynamics were like.
[Martijn, in English] I don't think they are really friends.
I think they need each other.
Cyberbunker is freedom, privacy and friendship.
For me.
[in German] The majority of them also lived up there,
were paid a very small salary, so were practically working for free,
just for food and lodgings but…
they were pretty much failed existences.
Apart from the fact that we weren't paid,
there was nothing to complain about, everything was great.
It was really good. I felt at home there and safe, etc.
Well, purposeful.
[in English] Michiel basically was trying to replace everyone with people
that he brought in through his volunteers' program,
so that he could better basically control them or something.
I don't know. He was up to something and it wasn't in our interests.
[Tim, in German] Although we had already taken many steps,
we had no one with eyes on the bunker itself.
But we wanted to see behind this door.
It would attract attention
if the undercover agent went inside the bunker.
That wouldn't fit his cover story as a gardener.
[voice actor as agent, in English] "On the morning of the 20th of December, 2018, the bunker guard called me."
2018, the bunker guard called me."
"He asked me if I knew a cheap cleaning lady
from Eastern Europe."
"They'd been looking for a cleaning lady for a while,
but no one from Traben-Trarbach wanted to work in the bunker."
[in German] It just so happened that we knew someone.
The female undercover investigator's name was Julia.
Part of the cover story was that Julia was Harry, the gardener's, girlfriend.
[Michiel] I think we walked through the bunker once,
and explained roughly what had to be done.
She worked, was kind, friendly and warm.
I can't remember anything negative about her whatsoever.
[Jörg] I was somewhat skeptical and not really in favor of it at first.
The dangers of sending a woman, alone, into a hermetically sealed bunker facility
that can't be accessed from outside,
and in which active criminals live, are pretty obvious, I think.
It's not something you're wild about doing.
[Jörg] She was left to clean the offices unsupervised.
Every floor, every room was accessible to her, unsupervised.
She had a key for every room.
It was strange, they basically didn't want any money at all.
And then Xennt said, "Maybe they're actually just police."
[Michiel] But it was implausible.
Harry had been there such a long time already.
And so it was.
[Tim] There were hundreds of photos…
of the bunker, from different rooms.
Various lists of passwords were photographed.
[Jörg] You could really see where people had their room, where the servers were,
where other equipment was, how things were secured.
[Tim] We had the network node surveillance running,
we had the undercover investigator.
We could see inside the bunker.
The last piece of the puzzle.
[Jörg] We had enough to give us ideas about how to gain access.
[in English] Xennt has loved bunkers since he visited a Second World War bunker in Arnhem as a kid.
since he visited a Second World War bunker in Arnhem as a kid.
He wanted to kind of recreate that futuristic feeling where he lived.
Which was in these strange underground caverns.
He was this kind of cyber Peter Pan who just refuses to grow up.
[automated voice as Xennt] One thing I have learned in the past,
there are many consumers and there are only a few creators.
I am a creator, not a consumer.
Some people describe me as a workaholic, but this is not true.
I simply cannot do nothing.
That's why you will never find me at parties.
I think of them as a waste of time.
Many consumers will destroy the work of creators
without any remorse.
That is why I have decided to create a defensive protection around me.
[automated voice as Xennt] "Anybody who do not share my ideas
is free to stay out of the way."
If half an army outside pops up, that wants to have a fight with you,
then that's perfectly fine,
they can stand there until the Earth comes crashing down.
[laughs] They won't get in.
[Tim, in German] We had to make sure that, at the time of the arrest,
there was no one in the actual bunker who could shut down the servers.
[in English] We never left the thing unguarded. There was always at least someone there.
[Jörg, in German] That's why it was clear that the only option would be to use a ruse
to lure the perpetrators out of the bunker and then arrest them outside the bunker.
[Kevin] The gardener asked us
if we would like to join him to a restaurant
because he inherited some money and he wanted to show his appreciation,
and stuff like that. He wanted to buy us, uh, dinner.
[Tim, in German] Harry called a restaurant and reserved a table for September 26th at 6:00 p.m.
For us it was end day, of course.
[Michiel] He really wanted everyone to come, I still remember that.
"You all have to come! You have to be there. He has to come too!"
He really did his best to get everyone to come.
[voice actor as agent, in English] "We discussed the evening meal again
and planned who should travel in which car."
"We did a head count."
"Eleven people would be coming to the restaurant."
[Tim, in German] We talked to our undercover investigator so that he made sure in advance…
I'M IN THE CAR
…that everyone accepted the invitation.
WHO IS THERE?
EVERYONE
[undercover agent, in English] "We made a toast."
"I thanked them all for letting me be part of the Cyberbunker family."
[police officer, in German] Police! Hands up! Everyone, hands in the air!
What the… What's going on? What's going on here?
Suddenly, there was a racket outside, there were helicopters flying around.
Everyone was chatting on WhatsApp. "Guys, what's going on in Trarbach?"
There was a flurry of activity.
There was a massive police presence in the local pub.
[Kevin, in English] That's the moment where you need to have a lot of self-control, just not to panic.
a lot of self-control, just not to panic.
We were, um, bound by our hands.
We were blindfolded.
They put headphones over our ears.
You're just too focused on what's happening right there,
then you can think about,
"Okay, what is happening on the bunker side of things?"
[Tim, in German] Night fell, everything was dark.
You're moving through a terrain that you've never entered before.
A bunker is always only secured from the inside.
It makes sense.
But this has the unfortunate side effect
that if you leave the bunker and no one is inside, it can't be locked.
[Kevin, in English] The security that we had in place at the time of the raid
was a simple padlock connected to the door.
[in German] And that's how it was here too.
-[interviewer] A padlock? -A padlock, yes.
[interviewer] And the special forces managed to open that?
We'd have been able to open it.
[chuckles] It's not that hard to crack a padlock.
[in English] That should never have happened. That was another thing.
This is not something that we would normally have done.
There's always someone at all of the bases,
and it's never actually fully, um…
like… empty, unguarded.
[Tim, in German] There were a multitude of rooms,
arranged in an angular fashion. It was pretty much a square.
The units moved deeper and deeper into the bunker…
and at some point, on the third level, ended up in the server room.
You have a rough idea of what you think it will look like,
but what we found on site definitely topped that.
At first the amount of data was overwhelming.
The server room was significantly larger than I expected it to be.
[Jörg] There were also a few empty shelves, so it was obviously set up for growth.
We could only shut down the servers
once the data on them had been backed up.
[Jörg] So, each server had to be backed up before it could be taken down.
[laughs] It's amazing, shutting down something like that.
[Jörg] Then it was game over.
If you take the servers away from the perpetrators, business is over.
THIS SERVER HAS BEEN SEIZED
The sites were down as soon as the bunker had been taken offline.
[news reporter 1] In the fight against cybercrime,
German investigators… BLOW AGAINST CYBERCRIME
…have dismantled a major data center for illegal business
on the darknet for the first time.
After almost five years of research,
the investigators achieved an extraordinary blow against cybercrime.
[news reporter 2] All of this ran over 280 servers,
with up to 200 customers on each.
DARKNET DATACENTER TAKEN OFFLINE
DARKNET DATACENTER TAKEN OFFLINE [news reporter 1] Through which, amongst other things, drugs
[news reporter 1] Through which, amongst other things, drugs and fake documents were distributed.
IN THE BUNKER OF EVIL
[news reporter 2] A total of 650 police officers were deployed.
The evaluation of the seized data has only just begun.
Our first impression is that the scope is enormous.
POLICE PRESS CONFERENCE ON CYBER-CRIMINAL RING
[news reporter 3] The bunker in Mont Royal, says one investigator,
is a real goldmine for them.
In total, two petabytes of data were secured, so two million gigabytes.
[Ed, in English] The police had seized a huge amount of data.
In a way, it was like this Aladdin's cave
of evidence about criminal activity on the internet.
This data started
to throw up interesting new avenues for other investigations.
[Leroy] So, the data we received
from the German authorities,
after the takedown of the Cyberbunker,
was substantial.
[in German] I think the scene
quite underestimated the authorities, and I did too.
The Cyberbunker bust had an enormous impact on the darknet scene,
on darknet drug trading overall.
The volume of stuff circulating
and the quantity of goods, which was just a number to me,
were in reality actually drugs that end up somewhere,
that are produced by people, people who suffer during the production process.
Just the whole extent of it
only hit me after the arrest,
and not straight away, it took a while.
I regret it all.
[Leroy, in English] It directly contributed to over 300 arrests
[Leroy, in English] It directly contributed to over 300 arrests in 22 countries, spanning three continents.
in 22 countries, spanning three continents.
The fentanyl that was taken off the streets,
just off of this one operation, was enough to kill five million people.
You can only imagine of the four hundred terabytes of data,
what you'll find, what you'll uncover, what crimes you'll potentially stop,
what lives you'll potentially save.
[Jörg, in German] The trial was a challenge, of course.
It was a wide-reaching charge,
it was a technically complex subject.
JÜRGEN BRAUER ATTORNEY GENERAL KOBLENZ
You must first prove the crimes
that have been committed from the computer center by other individuals,
and then you have to prove that the operators of the data center
were aware of, knew about, and encouraged these acts.
SPECIAL VOLUMES IMPRISONMENT
[news reporter] Herman X. and a few colleagues
have now been declared a criminal organization.
[Jörg] I was pretty sure there would be a conviction.
I still consider the investigation to be watertight,
and I also think the evidence is watertight.
ENTRANCE "BUNKER - TRIAL" (PLEASE WAIT HERE)
[Kevin, in English] Xennt turned completely gray and was more skinny than he was before.
We made eye contact and we just pointed fingers.
Like, "Are you okay?" He said, "Yes, I'm fine."
But it was kind of shocking to see him in that state.
[news reporter, in German] "Aiding and abetting some 250,000 crimes," the indictment reads.
[in English] They made so many accusations.
That's just hoping that something will stick.
[in German] So, you just have to note…
MICHAEL EICHIN MAIN DEFENDANT'S DEFENSE ATTORNEY
…Xennt didn't kill anyone, didn't rob a bank,
didn't steal an old granny's purse.
He supplied a server, or rather multiple servers.
That's what he's accused of, running a data center.
As such, he therefore remains convinced that he's done nothing illegal.
This being seen differently legally is just the way the law works.
However, in terms of evidence, the case was completely well-rounded.
[news reporter] Nevertheless, the Cyberbunker operators deny
knowing about their customers' illegal darknet activities.
[Kevin, in English] The trial in general was a show trial.
Angerer has to keep the show and the parade as high as possible
because what would otherwise happen when it would be evident
that the use of force wasn't necessary, if everybody would be free,
if the trial turned out to be nothing?
Plus, the guy wasted like his entire budget
for the coming ten years or something
on the silly raid with 650 Playmobiles
and extra blauw licht and, uh, and a helicopter and a tank.
[news reporter, in German] Senior public prosecutor Angerer spent nearly five years on the investigation.
Can he really prove the defendants knew what criminal services were operating?
Once, at the beginning of a trial day,
Xennt turned around to the other defendants
and held his finger up to his lips.
Probably to order silence.
DARKNET BUNKER: DEFENDANTS REMAIN SILENT
[Jörg] It astonished me
that they didn't testify at all and preferred to sit in jail.
[in English] He won't win that court case.
There's simply no way in hell he will ever win that court case, but…
[in German] I decided to testify shortly after I was arrested.
[Michiel] I think that Xennt should have stood up,
he should have explained
what was going on there.
That's why I made these notes,
just writing down everything I could remember.
My whole testimony took six days of hearings.
And I assumed, well, I knew nothing about any of it,
so I can't get imprisoned for that, it will probably turn out okay.
MANAGER CLAIMS TO NEVER HAVE SEEN DRUG TRAFFICKING CHARGES
Mr. Rugers, and this was shown in our interrogations,
plays down his role in this entire set of offenses as being insignificant.
[Jörg] I don't know how Xennt managed to get these people.
He obviously has some charisma, people follow him.
Rugers defended him to the end, even in the main trial.
He acknowledged the offenses, but always claimed that Xennt is actually a good guy.
That contradicts itself, that doesn't make sense at all.
Xennt always told me everything, but the fact he was sending messages
saying that it's okay for marijuana to be sold through the servers,
he never ever told me that.
So, he apparently left things out
and that's why he could rely on my involvement.
For five years.
I can't believe that the second in command
in the Cyberbunker hierarchy,
actually, didn't know what was going on. I just can't accept that.
In the trial against the operators of the so-called Cyberbunker
in Traben-Trarbach, Rhineland-Palatinate,
a verdict has now been reached.
[news reporter 1] The defendants were convicted of forming a criminal organization,
but not for aiding and abetting the internet crimes of their customers.
[news reporter 2] The Dutch citizen and seven co-defendants
will receive prison sentences of up to five years and nine months.
BIG FALL OF AN IT GENIUS
DARKNET BOSS MUST SERVE ALMOST SIX YEARS IN PRISON
VERDICT IN THE CYBERBUNKER TRIAL
[Xennt] Testing, one, two, three. Testing, one, two, three.
One, two, three, four, five, six. Testing, one, two, three.
Uh, I can't do it without looking at the notes.
"My trial was not fair and so neither was the judgement."
"It hasn't made us guilty of any crimes at all."
"We had nothing to hide."
"Nothing I could have said would have mattered."
"I was already convicted before I was arrested."
"The Chamber had to justify this long procedure somehow,
so someone had to take responsibility."
"I will not be intimidated or obstructed by the German judiciary,
the press or anyone else."
"I am on the side of all those who have been deprived their fundamental rights,
their professional and private lives for the sake of communication."
"I believe privacy is a fundamental right."
"Everyone has a right to privacy."
"The more communication evolves,
the easier it becomes for third parties to eavesdrop and spy on us."
"I am sure people like me will have a big impact on the future internet."
"The problem, however, is whether humanity is ready."
Next question, please.
[interviewer] Do you see yourself as a criminal?
No, not really.
I think he is a criminal,
in a different form than someone who commits murder or another crime,
but I don't think he has a problem with what he did.
[interviewer, in English] Do you consider yourself a criminal?
[Ed] One of the original Cyberbunker crew was not arrested that day, Sven Kamphuis.
He wasn't in the Cyberbunker, he was somewhere else entirely,
but he was not even arrested afterwards.
[Martijn] Why is that guy still out there?
Is he the kind of person that talks about things to other people,
which gives him the kind of privileges to stay out? I don't know.
[Ed] I remember asking Sven whether he had escaped arrest
because he had been an informant on the rest of the group
and he told me, "We don't negotiate with terrorists."
Uh, their law does not apply to us.
We don't stand above their law, we stand completely outside of their law.
It's their law, not our law. [breathes deeply]
There may be some overlapping basic values,
such as not murdering thy neighbor and that sort of stuff.
But other than that, our law is quite a bit different from theirs.
If you are… If you break a law in a country,
then you're liable to be arrested and convicted for breaking that law.
So, it helps if you think
that you're the prince of a sovereign nation,
of, you know, Cyberbunker.
[Martijn] It's difficult to really understand his values because…
they don't exist in my world.
He has his own visions and takings on certain subjects.
Quite a sinister individual, I think.
[Jörg, in German] Their advert stating no child pornography
[Jörg, in German] Their advert stating no child pornography or terrorism would be hosted
was fulfilled by the perpetrators with regard to terrorism.
We found no terrorism on the servers.
We found no terrorism on the servers. In terms of child pornography, it's a bit different.
[in English] There was said in court multiple times
that they found, um, things on the servers of Cyberbunker
like child pornography, but it's totally not okay.
[Jörg, in German] Mr. Kamphuis had a server
on which linked child pornography had been operating.
That means I can go through links,
so pretty unambiguous links, like pre-teen, that kind of stuff,
meaning pre-teenager age, and see the corresponding photos.
[in English] It's not actual rape.
Um, it's like going…
If you take a photo of a bank robbery and you print the picture of the bank robbery in the paper, right?
and you print the picture of the bank robbery in the paper, right?
Um, is this picture of the bank robbery, is that a crime by itself?
No. It's a picture of a crime that already happened.
[in German] I'm aware of Mr. Kamphuis' absurd notions with regard to child pornography. What he overlooks, of course,
with regard to child pornography. What he overlooks, of course,
is that behind every photo, every child pornography photo,
is active abuse, the abuse of the child.
That's quite different from a photo of a bank robbery.
In that, news about a bank robbery is shared.
Child pornography images are not shown to say there's been child pornography.
It's a completely different intention behind it.
And you would have to be pretty sick to make that comparison.
He wants to live his freedom and children should suffer for it.
He's not interested in children's freedom.
And that is the problem with people like him.
They talk about freedom, when they just mean their own.
[interviewer] Do you think that Mr. Kamphuis will remain free for some time?
I don't understand the question.
"In any data center where there are customer servers,
customers could use their servers for criminal purposes."
"You don't even notice it."
"There is nothing you can do about it."
That's simply wrong.
When Mr. Xennt says he didn't know anything,
I not only don't believe him, but he's lying.
We have email correspondence
in which Mr. Xennt clearly tells customers
about how he protects them from prosecution.
Um, so he knew exactly what was going on.
[Xennt] "I have many plans for the future."
"I know that there is no one else who wants to or can do what I want to do."
"You cannot stop me."
"I will still achieve my goals."
"Everything is ready. I just have to go home."
"I want to, and I will eventually, be able to realize my vision for a better world."
"No one can stop me."
Thank you for the interview.
[Bärbel] Traben-Trarbach was in a state of shock,
when all that came to light.
It's something that stays with you for a while.
[Winfried] Shock, and…
horror.
What went on there was huge.
[Hajo] It was a relief in a way.
Now it's burst, now the bubble has burst.
Now we finally know what happened up there.
It's good that it came to an end.
It was bad enough.
[Patrice] It still hurts today to think of the suffering that was sown with it.
How, in today's world, it's actually incredibly easy
for someone to do the same thing in another place,
with the same success, success that has negative consequences on people.
[Ed, in English] When he'd sublet a portion of the first Cyberbunker to another group
and he claimed not to know what they were doing there,
an ecstasy lab was found.
And then many, many years later,
when the police, you know, raided the second Cyberbunker
and they found these servers, the defense of Xennt to the Cyberbunker crew was,
"Well, we don't know what was on those servers."
And it struck me that it was the same defense,
you know, "Something bad was happening but we didn't know what."
I don't think Xennt has another way of doing business than in the dark.
And he will continue his activities because I think that's part of his life.
[Guido] He will do it again. Absolutely.
He has to find another bunker.
There's no question in that.
Well, the story of Cyberbunker isn't about success or failure,
it's about what will happen in the future.
So, we have to see what the future holds because the story might not be over yet.
[automated voice as Xennt] I am a creator.
Not a consumer.
I will make the world a better place to live in.
I have already recreated little parts of it.
For the first time in the world, a country used a nuclear bomb.
Though American atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
put an end to the World War,
it started a new kind of race in the world.
A race to build nuclear bombs.
The ultimate symbol of power.
1971. Pakistan lost the war to India for the third time.
They wanted revenge at all costs.
They had only one way left to defeat India.
To make a nuclear bomb.
However, wars are not won with weapons, but with intelligence.
And India's trump card was RAW.
Our RAW agents infiltrated Pakistan from Peshawar to Karachi.
They were not tasked to use firearms,
but to find critical information and send it to Delhi.
Away from their land, they were the soldiers of the land.
My name is R.N. Kao. I'm the chief of RAW.
And this is the story of one such gallant soldier.
God is great

Hey, Anwar!
-Tariq. -Peace be upon you.
-How are you? -All well by God's grace, Anwar.
Did you talk to your uncle about me?
I did, but he doesn't need new workers right now.
If you could arrange a meeting, Anwar.
You won't find a better tailor than me in all of Pakistan.
We've been doing it for generations. It's in my blood.
But they don't have an opening.
I hear the army is recruiting people.
Your uncle must be swamped with orders to sew new uniforms.
Try to understand, Anwar.
I don't want to be stuck sewing women's clothing forever.
And they drive a hard bargain.
-What can a 2-meter fabric-- -Help him out, Anwar.
He's a God-fearing man. He prays five times a day.
I'm trying, Maulvi Saab.
-Tell your uncle I recommended him. -Sure.
-Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too.
Thank you so much, Maulvi Saab.
-May God protect you. -May God protect you.
Army uniforms are not like women's clothing.
MOMIN TAILORS
-Do you know how to cut sleeves? -Yes.
Let me see.
Here.
Thread a needle.
Come on, sir. I can do it even while I'm sneezing.
Do it.
You better sneeze, boy. Maybe that'll help.
He needs training.
I'll pay you 300 rupees a month. Does that work for you?
Who will work for that? Right, Tariq? Is that okay?
-Works for me. -He agreed!
You start tomorrow, son.
Be careful! Are you crazy?
-I told you so many times! -Dad.
-Come on! Get in the car. -The girl made you lose your mind.
You agreed to work for 300 rupees.
Good.
Nasreen, Uncle Momin's niece.
Poor girl is blind from birth.

How would you feel if he had eyes for your daughter?
I'm holding back because you are Nasreen's father, or else…
This is his true self. He's a goon.
I love Nasreen.
I want to marry her.
He is a good, honest man, where will we find anyone better?
So I should hand my daughter to an illiterate man?
-How will he keep her happy? -Well, I'm sorry.
But you aren't very educated yourself. Didn't I let you marry my sister?
If her mom were alive, she would have talked some sense into her.
Dad, you know, I don't mind that I'm blind.
But after Mom passed away, I was a burden to you.
Tariq gave wings to my confined life.
I breathe freely when I'm with him.
No one can love me more than Tariq.

Mr. Alam, please come.
I'll read your report tomorrow. It's my wife's birthday today.
It's not a report, sir. It's news from India.
We would like to tell our audience that India has successfully carried out
its first nuclear bomb test explosion.
This operation was codenamed Smiling Buddha.
And it was carried out in Pokhran, Rajasthan
under the supervision of the Indian Army and scientists.
Hello.
-Can you hear me? -Hello.
Yes, please speak.
I am listening to you.
Sir, what about this cake?
Sir, India has declared it a peaceful nuclear test.
Peaceful nuclear test, my foot!
Consider it a threat from India.
We've already lost East Pakistan.
Now, we'll lose Kashmir as well.
We must accelerate our nuclear weapon's program, sir.
That's what I wanted to hear.
Sir, we need a nuclear physicist and metallurgical engineer for it.
And I think there's only one guy who can do it.
A.Q. Khan. Abdul Qadeer Khan.
What do you say, Mr. Alam?
We can't trust him, sir.
Even while he was in Pakistan, he has broken many laws.
Sir, he's doing groundbreaking work in Holland.
He just wants results, and he will do anything for it.
Then he's our man. Exactly who we need.
We need him back in Pakistan.
We must keep this mission a secret from the world.
For Pakistan.
We will starve, eat grass,
but Pakistan will build a nuclear bomb!
Pakistan was ready to go to any extent to make a nuclear bomb.
And to make it happen, they brought in A.Q. Khan.
The most dangerous scientist in the world.
-Welcome home, sir. -Welcome home.
-How was your journey? -Good.
He was now Pakistan's most important asset.
And Pakistan left no stone unturned to keep his family happy.
Welcome home, Mr. Khan.
It's time to put India in its place.
Hidden from the world,
a location was chosen for the nuclear facility.
Project 706, Pakistan's top secret.
The international community must come together
to condemn India's irresponsible actions.
On one hand, PM Bhutto was pointing fingers at India.
On the other, his illegal nuclear program was in full swing.
Enter Colonel Gadhafi of Libya.
He's a terrorist to the world, but for Pakistan, he's a close ally.
Gadhafi provided 500 million dollars in funding to Pakistan.
Banned nuclear components were smuggled in from the European black market.
And the uranium used in the nuclear bomb was smuggled in from Africa.
Pakistan was very close to achieving its goal.
I request the international community to put sanctions against India.
To stop its heinous designs.
This is the main centrifuge area.
-The outer perimeter. -And the inner perimeter?
-No, I mean… -Now for some special news.
Today in United Nations, Pakistan has got an important victory against India.
Declaring the Pokhran explosions irresponsible,
India's atomic program has been put on hold.
You burned it, didn't you?
Yikes.
That's what happens when you cook on high heat.
-Okay. -Move.
I'll be jinxed if you keep staring like this.
It's my right to look at you to my heart's content,
for I'm your husband, love of my life.
Bravo, my Shakespeare!
-Bravo. -Thank you.
That's enough now. The doctor advised you to rest.
There are five months to go. I can't rest so long.
All right, then.
Are you leaving early today?
Yeah, Uncle is coming in late today. So I have to open the shop.
Well, won't you kiss him goodbye today?
Traitor, come out!
After all…
Traitor, come out!
-Traitor, come out! -Break the door.
What's the matter? Are you worried about the baby again?
No. I'm just a bit anxious.
-It's a huge responsibility. -Lord Almighty has blessed us.
Trust me. You'll be the best dad.
Sir!
I don't care if I live or die.
But as long as I'm alive, I'll continue to serve.
I'll serve this nation and its people.
Mr. Kao is here. Look.
-Who should be our PM? -Mother of our nation!
RAW Chief is here from Delhi.
It must be a national emergency.
Madam, it is a national emergency.
Pakistan is making a nuclear bomb.
We have intel from Europe
that Pakistan bought banned nuclear components from the black market
and imported uranium from Africa.
They stopped us and are making one themselves?
We did everything legally.
Madam, we need to expose Pakistan.
The world needs to know the truth.
Where is their nuclear facility?
It's Pakistan's top secret. No one knows about it.
It's a radical country.
Before launching a nuclear attack on India…
You know they won't think twice.
I absolutely agree.
Pakistan is very close to conducting nuclear tests.
And we must find their nuclear facility and neutralize it before that.
What if it starts a war?
Wars only scare those who have never won one.
Pakistan should worry about it, not us.
We are running out of time, Madam.
And we don't need ammunition here. We need intelligence.
Someone who can pull this off without attracting any attention.
And you have someone like that in Pakistan?
I have just the right man for the job.
I trust you, Kao. Give him the mission.
India is counting on him.
After declaring an emergency,
election campaigns are in full swing in India.
Because of sensitive relations with New Delhi…
Dear, switch off the radio.
They keep yapping about India and Pakistan all day.
-Yeah. -Here, Tariq. Have some.
The food is delicious.
Dad, have some.
-No. -Here.
One shouldn't act greedy while visiting someone else's house.
Someone else's house?
You are the eldest in this family. Please have some.
So, Tariq, have you started looking for a better job?
Or do you plan to keep my daughter stuck in that shack forever?
Dad, it's my house too.
I won't listen to this anymore.
Come on, brother.
-It was better with the radio on. -India's increasing…
Nasreen.
I have to visit Naved after dropping you home.
He got a new order from Dubai.
I'm thinking of starting a business with him.
Since when did Dad's jabs start bothering you?
Sometimes I feel he's right.
You could have found someone better than me.
Well, that's true.
I just married you because of this scooter.
If I wanted to, I could have even married Dharmendra.
Why do girls love that actor so much?
And you haven't even seen him.
I haven't seen you either.
But that voice is all that he needs.
"I'll kill each one of you!"
-"Gabbar Singh, here I come!" -"Gabbar Singh, here I come!"
Tariq.
So, Mr. Romeo, have you tucked the blind girl in bed?
Are you angry?
Look, Romeo, she's just a cover. She's not your real wife.
Yes, sir.
And I hear you've started praying five times a day.
Your traitor father must be dancing in his grave.
Shall we get to the point, sir?
Well, I think you are useless.
But unfortunately, the boss trusts you.
Do you hear me?
Yes, sir.
I guess you know about our fireworks in Pokhran.
Yes, sir.
Our neighbors also want to do it.
They say, "Our fireworks will make your jaw drop."
We asked them where they are getting those from,
where they plan to make them, but they won't tell us.
-You must find that location. -Okay, sir.
And this operation will be called
Mission Majnu.
Okay, sir.
There's a roadside food stall at Chakri Road.
Go there and tell them that you want Gorilla brand spices.
Okay, sir.
And now… say your real name.
-That's not the protocol, sir. -Name!
-Amandeep Singh. -Full name.
Come on, come out, traitor. Come out!
Surrender now!
-Break the door! -Traitor!
Amandeep Ajitpal Singh.
Bloody son of a traitor.
Just rot there!
To find Pakistan's nuclear facility, we need our best man.
We can't screw this up.
Speak frankly, Mishra. I chose you because you have no filter.
So, tell me.
Sir, Amandeep is a mistake.
You're making a blunder by giving him this mission.
The whole department is against it.
It was his father who had sold sensitive military information to Pakistan.
Then how can Amandeep be reliable, sir?
His father betrayed the country and the son is paying penance.
What could be a better reason?
If it were anyone else,
they would have changed their name and lived an easy life.
But Aman took the tough path.
Amandeep is the number one cadet in the history of the academy.
My best student!
He won't let India down.
But what is his reference point?
Where will he start?
Pakistan Army's headquarters are in Rawalpindi.
And Aman knows that Pakistan
is not run by the government, but by its army.
Hey, man! One tandoori please.
With Gorilla brand spices.
Darling, do you plan to stay here till we get married?
Hey!
This gun is for you.
Sharma asked me to hand it to you.
And you turn me into minced meat.
Angry young man.
I want an account of every single penny.
I'm a spy, not an accountant.
Oh, my God.
A lover!
So she's your wife. I hope you haven't fallen in love.
They teach us in training. Whatever you do, be thorough with it.
Maybe you were sleeping in class.
How did you know? I really used to sleep.
But don't take me for a fool.
I'm a badass.
To fool around is one thing, but marriage… Never.
I've seen many like you.
A man can turn soft.
Take the gun!
You keep it.
That's not how I work.
Of course. You work with your killer eyes, Mr. Romeo.
At least ask my name.
-Tell me. -Aslam Usmaniya.
That's my real name. My food is real too.
Maybe bring your wife along some day.
Come and see me if you wish
Or go to hell, darling
Sir, he's quite something.
Fit and tall with personality.
He's a man of few words. And he's tough too.
Should I get your sister married to him?
Sir, all I mean is he's quite a guy.
Keep an eye on him.
And don't cozy up too much.
If he messes up, you'll be the one to shoot him.
Got it?
I had to lock it. The bill got expensive.
They make calls behind my back.
And here are the keys
in case you need to make a call.
Yeah. Thank you.
-Shall I deliver the uniform? -Yeah.
The one on top is for the brigadier. Deliver that first.
-Okay. -Yeah.
-I'll do it. -Okay.
Shut down your shop, if you can't do your job well!
Sorry, sir. I'll send someone right away.
Yeah, sure.
-Rasheed! -Yeah.
Hurry to the brigadier's place.
-What's the matter, Uncle? -They're all useless.
Two buttons are missing from the brigadier's uniform.
Well, don't worry.
Give me the buttons. I'll go and fix it right away.
-And I'll apologize too. -Yes.
That's better. He'll be glad to see someone from the family.
-Okay. -Here.
-Take these buttons. -Okay.
-You are here to see the brigadier? -Yes, sir.
Go on.
Sir, your tea.
Would you like some tea?
No, sir, I just realized.
You attended my wedding.
Right.
-Aren't you Rasool's son-in-law? -Yes.
That's why you looked familiar. All well with you?
Yes, by God's grace.
I'll be a dad soon, sir.
-Congratulations. -Thank you.
I've decided already.
If it's a boy, he'll join the army, sir.
Good.
If I were in the army, you would have seen me
shoot each one of those Indians.
But I would've spared Hema Malini.
Sir, I read in the newspaper
that the Indians are making a bomb called "Atom"
that can destroy all of Pakistan.
Look, if anything happens to my family,
I won't spare them, sir.
They don't practice what they preach.
They can even fix a cricket match.
That won't happen.
-Pakistan is not less than India. -But we don't have an atom bomb, sir.
Well, we'll have one.
But how? We don't have the money nor qualified people.
I won't make my son a soldier. I'll make him an atom bomb expert, sir.
My son will make an atom bomb for Pakistan.
We don't have to wait that long.
Pakistani scientists are educated and intelligent.
They are here from abroad.
God willing, we'll get the good news soon.
Sir, are we making a bomb?
Victory to us! Victory to Pakistan! Victory to us…
But where are they making it? In Rawalpindi?
Because I want to see it, sir.
Well, it's around here.
Everyone will see it.
Eid celebrations will be grand this time.
Sir, it's not confirmed yet, but there'll be fireworks before Eid.
It could very well be tomorrow. Just give me the location.
It's not confirmed yet,
but the probability is high it'll be around Rawalpindi.
Your assumptions are useless to me.
That's why I said, sir, it's not confirmed yet.
I need more time and…
So when will you confirm? After they destroy Delhi?
Protocol, sir!
To hell with your protocol.
My line is secure. And I don't care about you.
We don't have to wait that long.
Pakistani scientists are educated and intelligent.
Hey. I would like that book on nuclear physics, please.
Sir, I have no idea what kind of investigation he is doing.
He's either out buying books or at the library.
PAKISTAN ARMY WILL BE A GREAT POWER BY 1980
Dr. Faisal, Arif, Azam.
Azam… Where have I seen that name before?
Yes!
It's just research and analysis. Forget about seeing any action.
He was angry when he came, but I don't know what's going on now.
Damn it.
Nasreen! Are you okay?
Had I known there'd be so many toilet trips,
I would never have gotten pregnant.
-Can I help? -What would you do?
Nobody can help, but I need to sit down.
Now I know why they have western toilets abroad.
Pakistani scientists are educated and intelligent.
They are here from abroad.
-What are you doing? -What would I do without you?
Come on. I have to rush to the bathroom.
-Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too.
-Do you have western toilets? -Western toilets?
You seem to enjoy luxuries, mister.
Squat toilets work better though.
Hey, do you have western toilets here?
BILLA'S SANITARY WARE SHOP
No, you won't get it anywhere.
It has to be ordered specially.
-Okay. -It's quite a process to get it.
Though I did get it done on government orders a few years back.
I had a tough time.
I need it urgently.
My mom struggles to use squat toilets.
-May Almighty help her. -Yeah.
-It'll be quite expensive. -I have the advance payment right here.
-All right. It's 500 rupees. -Okay.
-And 100 rupees for the labor-- -Here you go.
Consider it done.
-Listen. -Yeah?
Well, I'm spending so much…
If I could see the job you did before, I would feel a lot better.
-Yes, of course. -Okay.
-Where is it? -The address should be here.
Where is Shahi Street?
Here it is. There it is.
In all of Rawalpindi,
only Billa can get this done.
Fantastic! Thank you.
House of the People, elections results are out
and, by winning 298 seats, the Janata Party has defeated
Madam's government with a full majority.
This defeat is attributed to the emergency declared by the prime minister.
This is the worst result the current government has ever faced.
As per our sources…
You lost the Raebareli seat, Madam.
Good.
Now I'll have the time to read some good books.
Who is being elected as the next PM by the alliance?
This is Mahatma Gandhi's nation.
Government can never be bigger than the constitution.
The abuse faced by the citizens during the emergency
will be compensated.
That sounds like revenge to me, Mr. PM.
To me, it sounds like justice.
Will we see a change in Pakistan policy, Mr. PM?
Anything can be resolved through talks.
They are our closest neighbors.
They should be our closest friend too.
Don't you think that will be difficult, Mr. PM?
You are very difficult to convince, my friend.
All good things are difficult to achieve.
But my government…
will not stop trying.
But, sir…
End this investigation.
It's a waste of time and money.
Thanks to the conspiracy theories you and your Madam came up with,
our relationships with neighboring countries are ruined.
I beg to differ, sir.
Because of our intel, even Israeli's Mossad
is looking for Pakistan's nuclear facility.
Sir, I don't think you realize how dangerous this situation is.
Pakistan has made a deal with Gadhafi.
They'll provide nuclear bombs in exchange for funding.
And soon, every Islamic dictator and terrorist group will have this bomb!
Sir, this could start World War III. That's why Israel wants to stop Pakistan.
And Pakistan is a direct threat to us.
We have to continue this mission on a war footing, sir.
Mr. Kao,
these issues can only be resolved through peace talks and diplomacy.
Violence won't change anything.
End this mission.
Okay, sir.
Then you should post diplomats on the borders too.
Why do we need an army?
50% budget cut.
Then we'll have to stop half our operations.
Our new PM thinks we are spies for the opposition party.
What were you expecting?
So, what did you say?
I resigned.
Sir?
This is the only way to divert PM's attention from RAW.
Continue the operation in Pakistan.
Away from PM's eyes.
This is my last order.
Yes, sir.
Stop.
-Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too.
-Is Shahi Street this way? -Yes. Who are you?
-Plumber. -I see.
Madam called me.
Madam called you?
Hey, where are you going?
Madam, are your neighbors not here?
They left seven months back.
-Okay. -Did they not pay your dues?
-Actually… -Come here.
Okay.
Thank you, madam.
Weren't some foreigners living here?
No, the husband was a Pathan.
I see.
But his wife was a foreigner.
Okay.
What was his name, madam?
I don't know, but they called him Mr. Khan.
I see.
Would you like some tea, son?
Sure, I would love some.
Thank you.
Yes, madam.
Those people…
They never talked to anyone or made friends with anyone.
I see.
-I even invited them over for tea one day. -Really?
She just made a face and left.
Madam, what did he do for a living?
Well, I don't know,
but a government vehicle came to pick him up every morning.
Along with a military guard.
And that woman would come outside in just a slip,
and go, "Bye-bye."
She'd come to see him off.
Good heavens.
Good heavens.
How did he look, madam?
How did he look? Well, like all our Pathans.
Big and tall.
Didn't they have any kids?
Yes, they had two daughters.
They were around the same age as Gullu.
And they used to play together sometimes.
Hi, Gullu. Come here. Which school do you attend?
Who are you?
Peace be upon you.
Your foreign neighbors left without paying my dues.
-Well, that's how they are. -Yeah.
They were the ones who looted India and Pakistan.
Yes. We won't spare them.
They caused the partition. They divided us…
-Peace be upon you. -Tariq!
Nasreen's dad came by.
He took her to the hospital.
Hospital?
-What happened, Nasreen? -It's nothing.
I just felt dizzy.
-Don't worry. -How can we not?
Thank God I came by. What if something happened to you?
Dad, please don't start again.
Well, where were you? You weren't at the shop.
Tariq is really busy with work.
Please don't make a scene.
-What else does he do? -Dad, please leave.
I'll go home with him. May God protect you.
Come on.
-Hey. -Come on.
Very good, Gullu.
Do you know about their dad's work?
Okay, Gullu, what were their names?
Sabah and Sara.
Sabah was nice but Sara always fought with me.
Really?
Which school did they attend?
That English school. Mary something.
Very good.
Form a line. One by one. Don't run.
Hey! Where are you off to, mister?
Who do you want to meet?
Forget me. Meet Jinnah.
Come on. Take it.
Here are the admission records.
I don't know, but they called him Mr. Khan.
Here's some tea, sir.
Sir, A.Q. Khan is the scientist who is here from abroad.
The facility must be in here.
Man, I ask for a chicken and you hand me an egg.
Sir, this name is critical for the mission.
I need some more resources--
I won't waste my resources on the basis of the toilet they use to take a dump.
Finer details make the bigger picture, sir!
Kao always taught us that--
He's gone, son. Your boss has abandoned you.
Now, you're under my control.
You can hate me all you like.
But imagine if I turn out to be right.
How can you be right?
You're your father's son after all.
And your child will be born with the same dirty blood.
"Blessed be the sacred land, happy be the bounteous realm."
Teach him that.
Your mission is over.
-Sir-- -You are dismissed.
Sir!
I always knew you were up to something.
Your behavior was always off.
Who knows what else you are hiding.
Tell me! How long has this been going on?
-Tell me. -It's not what you think.
Damn it…
Who were you talking to? Speak, you asshole.
Who is your mistress?
I've even seen you with your son at the playground.
I won't let you live with my daughter. Never!
I'll tell her everything. Everything!
There's a problem, sir.
His father-in-law heard his conversation.
Cover's blown. Means he's a goner.
Sir?
Finish Tariq.
Tariq.
Tariq, someone is at the door.
Wait here. I'll get that.
In theory, Pakistan is a democracy.
But in reality, the military runs the country.
The PM's chair could be toppled.
General Zia-ul-Haq was a very cunning and radical dictator.
Things were going to get tougher for India.
This location is surrounded by these hills and drilling is going on here.
Once we have the exact depth and integrity of the tunnel,
we'll transfer the device from the nuclear facility.
It'll be a swift operation, sir.
Mr. Khan, you have made Pakistan proud.
Please relax for a while.
It's not easy to get an appointment for a drink with you.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
Shoot!
General Zia-ul-Haq. Put your guns down!
Sir.
Mr. Prime Minister, you're under arrest for corruption and money embezzlement.
Pakistan won't be governed by corrupt politicians,
but by the Pakistani Army.
O Ever-living and Sustainer, with your mercy, we appeal.
I bear witness that there is no deity but Allah
And Muhammed is the Messenger of Allah.
If anyone wants to pay their respects…
I bear witness that there is no god except the One God.
They were thieves. They shot him and took off.
This city is going to the dogs.
My brother-in-law…
Tariq, let me explain. Listen…
He didn't know anything.
You don't think before you act.
"Cover's blown. Means he's a goner."
Didn't Sharma say this?
For the first time, Aslam defied his orders.
He saved your life.
Who are you?
I've been living in Pakistan for nine years.
Senior Field Officer Raman Singh.
I know Aslam.
And now I get to meet you officially.
Agent? You are both Sharma's pets!
Calm down, Tariq!
Don't interfere with my work.
I won't stop till I finish this mission.
You can tell Sharma that.
A.Q. Khan! I was watching him too.
I submitted a report four years ago.
No one bothered to read it.
We can work together.
We are running out of time.
-Are the maps in order? -Yes, sir.
-Evening, everyone. -Evening, sir.
What's the news from the Jews?
Sir, according to Mossad,
the nuclear facility is in Quetta.
Source of intel?
Issac. He's our contact in Tel Aviv.
He said there's a lot of military movement in Quetta.
The Israelis are planning an aerial attack on Quetta.
-When? -No confirmation yet.
And he has shared some aerial photos, sir.
Sir, Mossad's information is never wrong.
How about yours?
Ladies and gentlemen!
Martial law has been declared in Pakistan.
General Zia-ul-Haq will now lead Pakistan from Islamabad.
After her dad's demise,
she has forgotten to smile.
He was both her mom and dad.
We have to clean all the crockery at home.
Nasreen is very quiet at home too.
Can she stay here for a few days? It might cheer her up.
Yeah, I think that's better.
This is her maternal home.
Sorry, Uncle. I couldn't come to work for the last few days.
Don't worry about work.
We're going through a rough patch.
What do you mean?
What happened?
I lost an order of 400 new uniforms.
Four hundred?
It was the biggest order this year.
It was a uniform with a new design.
That rascal Hamid got the order instead.
Come on. Food is served.
As God wills.
Tariq!
Why are you avoiding me?
I'm not, Nasreen.
Then what is it?
I need you the most right now.
And you are pushing me away.
For the last few days, you have been distracted.
Please tell me what's bothering you.
I don't have an answer for you.
I'm not with you just for the good times.
Don't you trust me?
Prime Minister's office.
Excuse me, sir. There's a scheduled call from Pakistan.
-General Zia-ul-Haq is on the line. -Thank you.
General Zia.
Mr. PM, how are you?
Good. How are you?
All is well by God's grace.
-You must have received the news. -Yes.
It was a corrupt administration, Mr. PM.
So I had to take this step.
I am sure you took this step after thinking it through, General.
But I hope you'll restore democracy in Pakistan soon.
I completely agree with you.
And I assure you,
we'll announce elections within three months.
We must maintain this transparency between our nations.
That's why I made the first call to you, Mr. PM.
Our closest neighbor should be our closest friend.
-It's most important for Pakistan. -And also for India.
Thank you, Mr. PM.
God willing, we'll talk again soon.
Of course. Bye.
Bye.
-Who is next? -China, sir.
Hamid!
-Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too.
I hear you got an order for 1,000 uniforms.
No. That's just a rumor.
It's just for 400 jackets.
But wasn't the order for jackets already fulfilled for this season?
It's a special order. They are using a new material.
Anyway, as long as we get good business.
Tell me if you need any help delivering it.
I'll get my scooter.
I don't have to worry about it. The army will pick it up themselves.
Wow. We usually have to make ten trips to the army camp.
But you're being treated like a VIP.
They are taking them somewhere else, not the army camp.
Really?
Please tell me where and I'll open a shop there.
Had I known, I would've opened one myself, young man.
Before you did.
-May God protect you, Tariq. -May God protect you.
Lord, free us from the cycle of death but not from immortality.
Hail Lord Shiva.
Tariq, what's the plan?
An order of 400 army jackets is leaving Rawalpindi tomorrow.
The army will make the pickup themselves. This is a first.
Let's follow them.
I say let's kidnap them.
Shut up!
An innocent man died because of your rash ways.
Nonsense.
Man, you are very ungrateful.
Anyone else would have fallen at my feet.
-I can't work with him. -Tariq!
Okay, then let me fall at your feet.
-Let go… -I'll touch your feet.
Cut out this drama!
Come here. Focus. Come on, Tariq.
Come on, Mr. Romeo. Come.
What?
Israel can launch an air raid on Quetta anytime.
If we don't get the right location, this mission will fail.
And if you turn out to be right, then God save us.
We'll outmaneuver them.
We'll ask the army directly.
Really.
So what was wrong with my idea?
-Let's just kidnap them-- -Wait a minute!
Tariq, what are you thinking?
He must zip his lips.
And you…
Hail Lord Shiva.
-Sir! -Sir!
-What's your name? -Sohail Khan, sir.
Umar Sheikh, sir.
-Take their names down. -Yes, sir.
What's wrong, sir? What did we do?
What are you carrying in this truck? Liquor?
Liquor?
No, sir. It's a government order.
These are army jackets, sir.
Open it. Go and check.
Sir. We have strict orders. We can't open this consignment, sir.
You follow rules but drive a vehicle without a number plate?
It might have fallen off on the way, sir.
You're a disgrace to Pakistani Army.
I'll make it sure you two are court-martialed!
-Court-martialed. -Sir.
Sorry, sir. You can check the consignment.
Let's go.
Move aside! Sir.
Only jackets, sir.
Where to?
Sorry, sir, but we can't reveal it.
Kahuta, sir. We're taking these to Kahuta.
Sir, we're running late for the briefing.
-But how dare they talk to their senior-- -Sir, briefing.
Fix the number plate! Scoundrels!
-Sir. -Sir!
Get lost!
Kahuta. It's a small town.
It's just an hour and a half from Rawalpindi.
A.Q. Khan could commute easily to that location.
But I wonder.
Why would Pakistan build the facility so close to the Indian border?
Hidden in plain sight.
Ever heard this idiom?
I'm suffocating in this uniform.
Take this.
I must admit, though, you did look like a major.
How long would it take to grow your beard back?
It was years of hard work.
Wait a minute. Didn't you officiate Mr. Romeo's wedding?
If the maulvi is fake, can the wedding be real?
When the couple agrees, who cares about the maulvi?
-Hail Lord Shiva! -Hail Lord Shiva!
-Nasreen, you… -Why?
Did you think you could get rid of me?
Food is ready. Freshen up and come in.
Can you forgive me?
The problem is that I can't stay angry with you.
I couldn't help your dad.
We can't do anything to change what God has willed.
And the same God has blessed us with this bundle of joy.
-What happened? -Give me your hand.
Come on. Sit down. Easy.
Sit down.
-It's… -Have you thought of a name?
Yeah, I do have a name in mind.
I'll tell you one day.
Have you ever thought about moving away to live a peaceful life?
I'm always at peace when I'm by your side.
But honestly, tell me.
I can live in hell if you are with me.
Nasreen.
Let's go. I think the baby is hungry.
You are right, Mr. PM.
Pakistani sweets can't compete with this.
Thank you for sending these gifts from India.
You are most welcome, General.
By the way, how is your health now?
Well, my knees are killing me.
You should try yoga. You'll see the difference.
Intriguing I must say, Mr. PM.
I'll call you from home on Sunday to discuss this in detail,
if you are free.
Sure. Look forward to it.
-May God protect you. -May God protect you.
Be seated, please.
The PM is a close buddy of mine now.
Try some. It's delicious.
Please.
What were you saying about the Kahuta facility, Sarfaraz?
Sir, we should deploy anti-aircraft missiles there.
Sir, with increased movement, the enemies might spot us.
India can't imagine that we're building the bomb right under their nose.
He's right.
If we must, gun down a few Indians in Kashmir first.
That will keep them distracted.
-Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too.
-Tea, please. -Sure. Have a seat.
There are many soldiers here.
I counted around 70.
Do you know of any job openings in this area?
Maybe some factories looking for workers?
No, my friend.
The shops you see here,
the vegetable vendor, the snacks shop, the barber shop,
they opened in the last few years
when they built the army camp on the other side of the hills.
Really? How big is the camp?
I've never seen it.
They don't allow civilians there.
I wonder what they do there. It stinks all night.
Stinks? What could they be making there?
-We want two teas. -Peace be upon you.
Why don't you ask them directly?
If we don't return in an hour, inform Control.
Aslam, if you have a gun with you, leave it here.
I didn't bring a gun here. I'm not a fool.
Let's go.
Look. You're taking a huge risk.
This is the only way to convince your Sharma.
He's not my Sharma. Nonsense.
-Come on. Watch your step. -What have I gotten myself into?
Tariq, let's go back, man.
Up there?
Keep an eye out. I'll be back.
Hey!
Hands up!
Please don't shoot, sir!
-Please don't. -What were you doing?
-We lost our way. -What way?
-Our-- -Speak up!
-The way to our village, sir. -Yes, sir.
-Which village? -You know, the one… Baral.
-Baral. -Yes.
Turn around.
-Can I put my hands down? -Shut up!
-Not there. -Don't be smart with me.
Move.
-What's going on, sir? -Be quiet.
-Yes, sir. -Yeah.
There it is! We found Kalu.
-Kalu? -Our Kalu. Here's our Kalu.
-Here's our Kalu. -Kalu! Yes!
This idiot was missing since morning, sir.
-We were out looking for him. -Go on, then.
Where were you? Did you get anything?
-We did. -Here.
We found Kalu.
Don't you guys understand orders?
I didn't expect this from you.
I'm sorry, Mr. Sharma.
But if A.Q. Khan was staying in Rawalpindi,
why would they make a research facility in Quetta?
-Tariq's theory makes sense. -It's nonsense.
Sir, this is Tariq.
-Hey. -I know I'm called the son of a traitor.
But if you don't stand with us today, your son will be called son of a fool.
What do you mean?
History won't remember us agents.
But your name will be on the board.
"Officer Sharma,
whose lack of vision made us sit idly
as the country was destroyed."
Think about it, sir.
If they raid the wrong location, our mission will be exposed.
It'll be impossible to stop Pakistan from testing a nuclear bomb.
A nuclear bomb in an unstable country like Pakistan means destruction for India.
Decide with your head, sir, not emotions.
-Hello. -Raman Singh, you're a senior agent.
And you know very well that without solid physical evidence,
we can't stop Israel.
Yes.
If Israel attacked Quetta and it's not the right location,
Pakistan won't spare another minute.
Before we attack Kahuta,
they will conduct the nuclear test.
Then they'll aim their guns at Delhi.
Yeah.
Israel will carry out the air strike in the next 48 hours.
I will wait for physical evidence.
Sharma has agreed to stay by the phone for the next 48 hours.
And he'll wait for our report.
Israel won't back off without physical evidence.
If your theory is proven wrong, you'll have to go back to India.
Alone.
I'll go into the facility.
Have you lost it? It's a suicide mission.
You don't have to atone for your father.
Don't make a big mistake trying to pay penance.
We don't keep score with our mothers.
So why would we with our country?
A country is what its people are.
After Dad's demise,
many called me the son of a traitor.
They kicked us out of our house.
No one helped my dying mother.
Hate…
I just hated them.
But how can I forget the sardar
who never let me sleep hungry at the gurudwara?
Or Father Joseph, who fought everyone to admit me in school?
And Mr. Kao, who trained me
to make me capable of protecting this country?
We are India.
We don't feed on hatred, but on love.
We won our freedom with love and peace.
Tell me. Is there another country like us?
I can do anything to protect a country like that, Raman.
Anything.
My friend,
go across the hills.
We have your back.
My gun will take care of the soldiers.
We live under your skies
Nestled in your lap
We live under your skies
Nestled in your lap
We are the only one in the world who
Call our soil "Mother"
Call our soil "Mother"
-The plan isn't foolproof. -We don't have time.
MY DEAR NASREEN
We stayed up for you all our lives
Now you must come to put us to sleep
May your head be held high forever O Motherland
Even if nobody knows us
GOODBYE NASREEN AMAN
Even if nobody knows us
We flow anonymously in the wind
Like fragrance…
We are the only one in the world who
Call our soil "Mother"
Call our soil "Mother"
What's wrong, Nasreen?
The baby has not moved since yesterday.
Everything is fine, Nasreen.
It happens. You are fine.
Please wait outside. I'll run the rest of the tests.
Okay.
-Is everything all right? -Yes.
-Wear this. -Why do I have to wear this?
They won't let you enter without it.
-Why are you forcing me? -It's an X-ray machine.
The radiation it emits is so strong it will remain in your body.
It can turn you impotent.
Its light is so dangerous
that we don't touch the machine without this jacket on.
It's dangerous.
Please take Nasreen home. I'll be back soon.
-But Tariq… -Just…
-We don't need to enter the facility. -Why?
Because Kahuta only has one barber shop.
I can't believe it, man.
You're a genius.
Remember, this is the signal.
What is this?
Mr. Romeo's signals are also odd like him.
Please come in.
Peace be upon you, sir.
-Please come. -Sir.
-I want a shave. -Sir.
Hey, son, order some tea.
Please come, sir.
Sir, the chair is free now.
-Well, give me a haircut. -Please come.
When will he give the signal?
Chotu!
-Yes, sir? -Clean this up.
Okay.
You…
Oh, my God. A fight broke out. Look!
-How dare you tease my sister? -What's going on?
-How dare you… -He's hitting him.
-My sister… -Get off me!
What's the matter?
Stop them!
-Somebody stop them! -Stop!
Let go!
Get off me!
Don't interfere!
This is my hair. I'm taking it.
But look at the mess here! Clean it up, Chotu!
You took long enough.
Hey! Don't mess with me!
I won't spare you. You scoundrel.
Hey!
Hey, idiot!
I won't spare you!
What next, Tariq?
We need to take it to India.
Lahore?
Man…
They have tight security here.
How will you board Samjhauta Express without your passport and visa?
No other way to reach India sooner.
Wagah is just 20 minutes out.
You'll get caught if you board.
Bhanu Chak village is between Wagah and Attari.
Wait for me at that railway crossing.
Are you crazy?
See you later.
Go to that line.
-The papers aren't in order. -They are.
-No, they aren't. -Sir, it's all there.
Passport, please.
Lift your arms.
Hey, don't touch my turban.
Okay, all right. Go on.
Hey. Please forgive me.
-Step aside. -Sir.
I said step aside!
-What's the matter, sir? -Step aside.
-Go on. -Sir.
Go on.
Sir! Please check this also. What's wrong?
You don't have a turban in your passport photo.
-Be assured, everything else is there. -Really?
Take it off.
-What? -Take your turban off!
Take the turban off?
-They want to remove our turbans. -He's asking us to remove them.
Take off our turbans?
He's asking us to take off our turbans.
He's asking us to remove our turbans.
It's our pride!
Don't forget.
This is also the land of our gurus.
When I can fight against 1.25 lakhs, only then will I be called a Sikh.
One who says this is free of miseries. God is truth.
This train won't leave without my turban.
-Wait a minute. -Sir.
Do you want to start a war on the platform?
-Sir, you can go. -Okay.
Come on, friends. Let's go to Amritsar.
Come on! The Sikhs of the Lord are victorious!
The Sikhs of the Lord are victorious!
Come on, friends!
Here, son.
-Is this suitcase yours? -Yes, sir.
-Whose bag is this? -It's mine, sir.
-Whose is this? Is this yours? -Yes, it's mine.
Oh, my god!
Where is it?
-What, sir? -My wedding ring.
-Wedding ring? -My wedding ring is missing.
Where's my wedding ring? Find it.
Was it expensive?
It wasn't expensive, but my wife will kill me.
She will kick me out of the house.
-Faisal, listen carefully. -Yes, sir.
Coach number seven, seat number seven. He's a sardar. Arrest him.
-Arrest the sardar in seat number seven. -Yes, sir.
Oh, my God.
I've been married for just two years.
Yes, sir. We're looking for him, sir.
She will kick me out of the house. Stop.
-Speak. -Why is it like this, sir?
Nothing. Nothing.
Hey!
Get back inside!
Go up!
Are you okay?
-Yes. Lahore's asset. Quick! Let's go. -Come on.
Not meds, just prayers.
Sir, coach number seven, seat number 19.
A woman in a blue dress, wheatish complexion.
There's a package in her suitcase. Send it to the lab.
What is in it?
Hair samples of people working in the Kahuta facility.
If they are making a bomb, they are exposed to radiation every day.
So the radiation levels must be high in their hair samples.
You have only 12 hours, sir. Please don't waste any time.
Amandeep Ajitpal Singh, signing off.
Sodhi, listen carefully.
Wait a minute, please.
Special Agent Sandeep Singh. We have to check your bag.
-Check her bag. -Give it.
What's the matter, sir? My bag…
-Are the samples here? -They will be soon.
The technician should be here early.
Give it to me!
What is it?
Check for radioactivity. How long will it take?
Hurry up.
Radiation markers are very high.
And there are fragments of highly enriched uranium too.
Only one thing can be made with this kind of uranium.
Atom bomb.
-Sharma? -The facility is in Kahuta, not in Quetta.
We have physical evidence.
-Please stop Israel. -Shit!
Fifty kilometers from the target.
Come on, Issac.
Issac, Santosh here.
Lock in the target.
T minus 10.
Issac, Mossad. Get me the air marshal now! Go!
Nine.
Eight.
Seven.
Abort the mission.
It is not in Quetta.
Four.
Three.
This is the air marshal. Squadron leader, abort the mission.
Two.
Abort the mission immediately.
Sir, the nuclear facility is close. The location is Kahuta.
We must take action, sir.
You carried out this mission without my permission.
We'll discuss that later.
Our agents wouldn't have risked their lives in the field if we had time.
I said I'll think about it.
We need to bomb the Kahuta facility, sir.
I can't push our country into another war without thinking it through.
Our agents did a fantastic job.
They made the country proud.
We are indebted to them for their service.
Sir?
It was stopped in time, my friend.
-Okay, sir. -Wait a minute.
I'm sorry for my behavior.
Sitting at this end of the phone,
I considered myself to be the biggest patriot.
Shouting orders. Swearing.
Calling someone a traitor,
pointing fingers and that made me a patriot.
But thanks to you, I know from now on.
Patriotism is not in the blood but in your soul.
Anyone can talk, but those who put it into action…
I salute them.
I don't know about history,
but my children will know who Amandeep Singh was.
Son of the nation.
A true soldier.
No one can take your country from you.
Connect me to General Zia.
Mr. PM, please listen to me.
Give me a straight answer.
Is Pakistan making a nuclear weapon or not?
I don't owe you an explanation, Mr. PM.
I'm not obliged.
But you are a friend.
That's why I'm telling you.
Pakistan is not making a nuclear bomb.
Then what's going on in Kahuta?
I don't know what you are talking about, Mr. PM.
Don't pretend, General.
We have physical evidence from the Kahuta nuclear facility.
I was wrong.
Pakistan can't be trusted.
I hope you remember that you surrendered in every war.
We won't go easy on you this time.
Shut down your nuclear facility now!
Mr. PM…
Faisal!
Shut down the nuclear facility.
Sir? We are very close to our goal.
If we stop the work now, it'll set us back years.
General, we'll soon test it…
Can we test it in the next 15 minutes?
We need some more time, General, and…
India's fighter jets can reach Pakistan within 15 minutes.
They'll turn our 500-million-dollar facility to dust!
We'll be left picking up pieces.
Shut the facility right now!
Yes, sir.
I'll issue the orders to shut down the facility.
How did the Indians find out about Kahuta?
Only RAW could have done this.
A handful of Indian spies
exposed us in front of the world.
Pakistan Army, ISI,
police.
Just a handful of their spies have exposed us to the world.
Pakistan's dream has been destroyed, General.
Are we gonna take this lying down?
Tariq, where have you been?
-Tariq. -I'm back.
I won't go anywhere now.
What happened?
Is everything all right?
I have some good news, Nasreen.
We are leaving for Dubai this Friday night.
Dubai?
Yes, I found a job there.
-Really? In Dubai? -Yes.
Thank God.
Nasreen, I've never said…
this enough to you.
I love you a lot, Nasreen.
Tell me something I don't know.
There are RAW agents in Pakistan.
Impossible, sir.
-Really? -It's not possible.
It's possible!
Bastards!
They know about Kahuta.
RAW agents are working here
while ISI is twiddling their thumbs.
Find them and finish them.
Yes.
Or I'll have you skinned in public!
I'll give you 24 hours.
Twenty-four.
I have a bunch of morons with me in Pakistan!
Morons!
Get me the records
of every call made to India
in the last two weeks.
You have 12 hours.
-Tickets for Dubai. -Tickets for Dubai?
Easy. Go easy.
A total of 7,255 calls were made.
Mark the calls made between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.,
especially from offices and shops.
-Okay, sir. -One more thing.
Concentrate on calls made to Delhi.
-How many people? -Twenty-one.
Shut down the phone lines. Start the raids.
If anyone tells you they are orphans, assume they are RAW agents.
Finish them on the spot.
But, sir, some of them might be Pakistani citizens.
There are martyrs in every war.
Operators, listen carefully.
We have orders to ban all calls.
-Do not patch through any calls. -Yes, sir.
You are going to a new place, so far away from all of us.
How will you take care of yourself?
Tariq is with me.
Don't worry. I'll send flight tickets for you too.
We'll miss your biryani after all.
-Won't you invite me to Dubai? -Can you make biryani?
-Well, I'll learn to. -Then I'll invite you too.
I wish you all the success.
And may God fulfil all your wishes.
Amen.
My child.
-It's time for Dubai. -Yeah.
These kids will go to Dubai,
and we'll still be here stitching clothes.
Don't make a fuss without a reason
Yes, sir?
-You're shutting shop early today. -Yeah, I have some snacks left.
I can pack them for you.
-Do you live here? -Yeah, I have a bed here.
Do your parents live with you?
Yeah. Want to meet them?
Mom!
Dad, come outside, please!
Nasreen, I forgot to say goodbye to some friends.
-I'll go see them. -Come back soon.
Yeah.
Victory to thee, O Hanuman! Ocean of wisdom.
You're the divine messenger of Lord Rama…
You dispel the darkness…
Dad!
No uniform on the body And no stars on the shoulder
We live under your skies
Our flag will not fly low
Whenever there's a mention of sacrifice
We will be first in the queue
No matter if we're on the earth or not
We will be smiling among stars
We will be smiling among stars
Tariq!
Tariq, better take off from here.
What about Aslam?
I came from his diner.
I could've saved him if I'd gotten there in time.
Aslam?
Let's get out of here. We can cross the border from Fazilka.
-Nasreen? -Don't be crazy!
You have more chances if you escape alive.
For her sake, come with me!
Deceit leads to the same pain whether it's India or Pakistan.
I won't let Nasreen and my baby go through what I had to.
-I must go. -I won't say goodbye.
I'll see you soon at our home,
in our country.
May Lord Shiva help you.
Why the hurry all of a sudden?
Flight time's changed.
I couldn't even say goodbye.
Drive carefully, man.
Are you okay?
If you weren't making those calls to India, who was?
To India? I have no idea, sir.
Did you give the shop keys to any employee?
Keys?
-Tariq? -Tariq?
Sir.
Inform the airport security. Tariq Hussain and Nasreen.
If their IDs match, detain them.
Yes, sir!
Here's the airport, sir.
Lower it.
Come, Nasreen.
Good evening, sir. Passport, please.
There he is. Stop!
Thank you, sir. Have a safe flight.
Come.
Hands up!
Hands up!
Hail Lord Shiva.
Commandos, this way!
Look at this photo carefully.
Check-in area, waiting area, just spread out.
Slow down, Tariq. I can't catch my breath.
We are at the security gate.
You guys check the left side.
-What's wrong? -Nothing.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
-Come on. -Please come forward.
-Have you seen him? -Come on.
Show me the name entries.
-No, sir. -No.
Have you seen him?
Yes, sir. He just went in.
Come on! Quick!
He has cleared immigration.
-Tariq… -Just a few more steps.
You are holding my hand really tight.
Let go!
Something's off. What are you doing?
Sorry. Come on. Sit here.
Easy. Sit.
-Are you okay? -I'm fine.
But what's wrong with you?
It feels like we are running from someone.
What's wrong?
Tariq.
What's wrong?
Tell me.
Come on. Tell me.
You are tired.
I'll get a wheelchair for you.
Come here. Sit on this.
Come.
Be careful.
We don't have adjoining seats on the flight.
But don't worry.
You seem more worried than me.
I have been trying to tell you something.
Aman.
That's the name I have for our baby.
Do you like it?
Amazing.
It's a beautiful name.
Whether we have a boy or a girl, it will work for both.
Aman.
There's some money in your bag.
Take care.
You're talking as if you're going somewhere else.
There is a separate queue for women here.
A staff member will take you.
How about you?
I'll meet you on the other side.
My Lord knows
My Lord knows
How I love you
My Lord knows
My Lord knows
How I love you
Do you have the address?
Passport and ticket, ma'am.
Stop!
Long live India!
Come with me, quickly.
-What happened, sir? -Nothing. Some security matter it seems.
Hey!
Ma'am, please mind your head.
Please have a seat.
Back off!
I said back off!
Surrender while you still can!
Shoot!
Sir, he's got our man.
Shoot!
Beloved
Forgive me
That I left you
In between, on the way
So as not to break the promise I made to my mother
I broke the promise I made to you
I broke the promise I made to you
Go, Nasreen.
Go.
It is you who is the one
But what can we do
We call India our life
We are the only one in the world who
Call our soil "Mother"
May God protect you, Nasreen.
Call our soil "Mother"
Welcome to Dubai International Airport.
Tariq?
My name is Kao. I'm Tariq's friend.
Where is Tariq?
"My dear Nasreen, if Mr. Kao is reading this letter to you,
then I'm not in this world anymore."
Nasreen, you always said that I keep secrets.
I am guilty of that.
I've always loved you with all my heart.
But bound by my duty, I had to keep some secrets from you.
Today, I want to tell you everything.
My name is Amandeep Singh, and I'm an Indian.
Because of the sacrifice of Indian agents,
the secret nuclear facility in Kahuta was exposed to the world.
Yet, Zia kept denying this truth.
Why should Pakistan indulge in the proliferation
against which Pakistan, on principles, is opposed to?
Because we have no intentions of developing a nuclear device.
Sir, we are honorable people.
But the truth can't be kept under wraps.
In 2004, A.Q. Khan admitted
that Pakistan had sold nuclear technology
to rogue nations like North Korea and Iran.
We should… I would be worried more about what you say about me.
Not what Bush says or Dick Cheney says.
I… don't care.
Pakistan couldn't conduct nuclear tests for the next 20 years.
In 1998…
under the leadership of PM Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee,
India conducted its second nuclear test.
And it became the biggest nuclear power of the subcontinent.
It's not the wind that holds our tricolor high.
It's the last breath of our martyrs.
We live under your skies
Nestled in your lap
We live under your skies
Nestled in your lap
We are the only one in the world who
Call our soil "Mother"
Call our soil "Mother"
We stayed up for you all our lives
Now you must come to put us to sleep
May your head be held high forever O Motherland
Even if nobody knows us
We stayed up for you all our lives
Now you must come to put us to sleep
May your head be held high forever O Motherland
Even if nobody knows us
Even if nobody knows us
We flow anonymously in the wind
Like fragrance…
We flow anonymously in the wind
Like fragrance…
We are the only one in the world who
Call our soil "Mother"
Call our soil "Mother"
No uniform on the body And no stars on the shoulder
No uniform on the body And no stars on the shoulder
Our flag will not fly low
Whenever there's a mention of sacrifice
We will be first in the queue
No matter if we're on the earth or not
We will be smiling among stars
We will be smiling among stars
Let the garden that we call India
Keep flowering
Let the garden that we call India
Keep flowering
We are the only one in the world who
Call our soil "Mother"
Call our soil "Mother"
Call our soil "Mother"
Call our soil "Mother"
Call our soil "Mother"
Call our soil "Mother"
Come on, boys! Time to get ready.
Bikash!
-Moba, get ready. -Yes?
In a minute.
Give it back.
You ripped it off. Give it.
-Take a shower. You're stinking. -I'm ready.
You're not ready.
Come on, Rohan, get ready.
It's time to go.
Dude, let me pump.
Like you'll become Rocky in a day.
Looking sexy, bro.
Come on.
Sir.
Yes.
Yes, I…
You'll receive the photos and videos.
If possible, have a look at it.
Yes.
The team is solid.
Yes, sir. Goodbye.
Sir, we're almost ready.
We can leave in 30 minutes.
What's the rush?
Let's play one game.
Let it be.
I can't see you losing again.
Fucker, I think I trained you in the wrong game.
Brother Rajeev…
don't you think we should wear, like, some matching jerseys,
-or like black t-shirts today? -No.
-I was thinking that… -Don't think.
Just go and change!
-Couldn't find anyone better? -I'll handle him.
Don't worry.
Let's leave after breaking our fast.
Okay.
I told you, boys.
Let's go to the embassy in the morning itself.
Absolutely irresponsible, both of you.
Mom, how could we possibly know this would happen?
Thanks to you, we're not in Malaysia.
The elders will celebrate Eid there, and we're stuck here.
Do you know how upset your grandfather is?
Not his fault the embassy ran out of ink.
Yes, right. It's my fault if my boys cannot wake up in the morning.
If only we had reached earlier in the day, our visas would've been stamped.
But you reached the embassy five minutes before the visa office closes.
Did you try to knock some sense into your Chhotu?
How important it is for him to go and do his Master's?
-Please hear him out once, Mom. -Stanford.
People struggle to get a seat
and here they are inviting him.
Right, Mom, but what I--
The least you can do is make him understand.
How many times do I have to tell you
-the same goddamn thing? -Stop talking to her like that.
No, this is not fair.
I've said it a million times.
I don't want to go to Stanford.
I want to stay in Bangladesh, I want to work here.
But no, we only have to do what mom wants.
And mom wants to send me away, right?
Why do you keep pushing me away?
Faraaz!
I'll talk to him.
But, Nazneen, we haven't received any quotations from them.
Yes, you can send them in.
Yeah.
And let Dr. Mujahid also know, please.
And the file on my table by tomorrow nine.
Yes. Now that I'm not going to Malaysia we might as well…
Yes, exactly.
-So you, Dr. Mujahid, all-- -Mom.
Nazneen, let me call you back.
Yeah.
Mama, I'm sorry.
You don't want to go to Stanford.
That's fine.
If you aren't happy, how can I be?
And will you please stop assuming things, Chhotu?
Why will I want to push you away?
I'm just concerned about your future,
and I just want the best for you.
I know.
But…
don't stress so much about my future.
Where are you going?
Holey Artisan. I told you.
Chhotu.
Mom.
Whatever I do, I'll make you proud, okay?
Don't finish all the chicken.
-I am-- -Dude, your plate's still full.
I'll pack the dates.
Don't others have to eat?
Finish your food first.
Dude, I'm a heavy eater.
-Heavy eater my… -Pass the chicken.
Chicken…
It'll get over like this.
But you have plenty on your plate.
It's always the case with him. Always.
Your plate is already full.
Eat a little less, man.
I have it.
Can you pass me the onions?
You know what…
go and unpack.
-What happened, Brother Rajeev? -Let's drop it for now.
We'll pick this up later.
Go.
-Go and unpack. -Bro, we've been training for so--
Shut up
And why did you stop eating?
Carry on, and have a feast.
Eat.
Eat.
Enjoy the feast.
These fritters… bananas.
How about I order some biryani if you're still hungry?
It'll be a lavish treat.
Look, if you want to act like kids…
then go back home.
I don't need you.
-I'll manage on my own. -Don't say that.
-Sorry, Brother. -Why are you saying sorry?
Why are you saying sorry?
Prove me wrong!
Prove it!
Make me believe that I haven't dug my own grave,
by picking you all.
Prove it!
Show me that your generation isn't useless.
That they have the passion…
which the whole world will notice
and say, "They are our heroes. We want to be like them.
We want to achieve what they did."
Stop fighting like you're in kindergarten.
My fritters, my bananas, my clothes, my this, my that.
What the fuck is this attitude, assholes?
I mean your bond and your unity is so weak.
Why even blame the world?
And then you say you want to fight for everyone, bloody losers!
-I don't think you guys can do it. -Bro…
-Bro… -Brother Rajeev!
-Brother Rajeev! -Brother…
-We'll do it. -We want to do it.
We'll do it.
Goodbye.
Run!
Shut the door!
Get up, go inside.
I won't shoot, get in.
Run.
All of them…
everyone is dead.
Keep quiet.
Stay down.
Stay low.
Move.
Move.
Calm down, stay quiet.
Come to the center.
Sit here.
Sit here quietly.
No one will harm Bangladeshi Muslims.
-Khairul, clear upstairs. -Come on, everyone. Go downstairs.
Are you deaf?
Kneel down with your heads down.
Bikash, check over there.
You, come here.
Move it.
All clear outside?
Clear.
All clear.
-Sit down. -Mom…
Cover her eyes.
Thank you.
You want boom-boom?
Bikash, main door.
Check everyone's ID.
Those without an ID, make them recite any sura.
ID?
Kill all those who are not Bangladeshi Muslims.
What's your name?
-What's your name? -Zahoor.
Recite a sura.
"I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan."
What's your name?
Dr. Salim.
Salim what?
Salim Iqbal.
Salim Iqbal?
-Take your pants off. -But, son…
I'm not your son!
-Take off your pants. -Rohan!
He's a senior man. Have some manners.
Come forward.
Don't be scared.
If you're a Muslim, then recite any sura.
"In the name of Allah, the one who acts with mercy.
Source of mercy.
May Allah, the Lord of the worlds, be praised."
Sit down.
Sit down.
You…
show some respect.
Sit down.
Whose guitar is this?
Whose guitar is it?
It belongs to him.
It's mine.
What's your name?
Tahmid.
Tahmid.
Tahmid Haseeb Khan.
How are they related to you?
They are my cousin sisters.
They are his sisters.
So? Must be his sister.
Not like I intended to marry her.
Your fly is open. Zip it up.
What are you looking at?
Asshole.
Zaraif, when will you learn to knock?
-We-- -I'm here, don't worry.
Come out.
Come out.
Move!
Okay. It's okay.
-It's okay. -Come out.
Okay.
Go and sit over there.
Move.
Move. Sit down.
-Sit down. -Move.
Faraaz Hussain.
The "Prince of Bangladesh".
Who are they?
They are with me.
That's quite evident.
But who are they?
She's Shadab Aslam's sister.
Please.
And what about her?
She's my neighbor, Rabia.
Why do you know him?
I don't know him.
We played football a couple of times, that's it.
He is educated.
He studied at the university.
I don't know what the fuck he is doing.
Kilo 81.
Come in, Kilo 81.
Kilo 81 copy, sir.
Kilo 81, confirm location.
North Avenue, lane 83, sir.
Kilo 81, reach Lake View Clinic immediately.
We are getting reports of gunfire from there.
Copy, sir.
And Farooq, don't forget to wear your helmets and bulletproof vests.
Sir, you know we've put in a request,
but we've still not got any response from the head office.
Okay, be safe.
Copy, sir.
Did you hear that?
"Be safe."
Let's head towards Lake View Clinic.
Head down.
Prince.
You wanna go?
Go.
Hello! Where do you think you all are going?
I know them, Rohan.
I played football with him.
So?
So?
He's a Muslim.
What about these chicks?
Let them go.
Dude, just because you know him, doesn't mean they can go.
We're not some nightclub bouncers here.
Let them go.
-Thank you. -Not the girls.
Yeah, let the girls stay.
What happened? Why did you change your mind?
You were right.
They're absolutely un-Islamic.
Please, bro. Let us go.
Do you want to go? The door is there.
-Make them sit. -Please. No!
-No, wait! -Stop it!
-Please! Stop! -Stop!
-Please… -Stop!
-Sit down. -Stop it.
-Sit the fuck down! -Down.
Heads down.
Move.
Get back.
Mobashir, position.
Positions!
DHAKA METROPOLITAN POLICE
Why the fuck are they facing that side?
All units come in.
They're firing from Holey Artisan! Not Lake View Clinic.
I repeat.
They're firing from Holey Artisan. Not Lake View Clinic.
-Stay back. Move, please. -Excuse me.
-Stay back. -Excuse me, sir.
-Please move. -Please, excuse me.
-Please, move. -Ma'am, please move.
-No one gets close. -Please, move.
Ma'am, where do you think you're going?
-Please move the barricades and let me in. -No one's allowed in there.
-Please go outside. -Please.
What is your name?
Do you know who I am?
-We said no. -My son's in there.
-Can't you hear us? You can't go in. -Hey!
-Move. -Who's your senior?
-Stay back. -Call your senior.
-Step back. -No one will come inside.
-Leave my hand. -Step back, please.
-Move. -Mom, please.
-No one's allowed in. -Step back.
Please move.
Does it hurt a lot?
You should've left quietly.
Mr. Salim.
Mr. Salim.
Doctor!
Attend to him.
Let me see. Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
Let me see.
Careful. Don't worry.
Can I get an antiseptic or something?
Shall I fetch it from Lake View Clinic?
Does anyone have perfume or anything?
-I do. -Give me.
-In my bag. -Everything will be fine.
-Moba. -Don't worry.
Sit down.
This is forbidden by Islam.
It has alcohol.
There's nothing else to clean the wound.
May I?
This will sting.
Alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Hold this, please.
Over here.
Tighter.
Hold it.
Everything will be alright.
Don't worry.
I can still see people in their balconies recording.
Tell them to go inside.
Send someone here.
And why are so many people standing at the gate?
Post someone here.
Nobody should move in or out.
What about the barricades?
Okay.
Make sure nobody comes in or out.
No press, no civilians.
The commissioner is here.
Mushtaq, update me on the situation.
Sir, SI Farooq was the first responder, who informed us that the gunfire,
was coming from Holey Artisan.
Then why was Lake View relayed to the control room?
I don't know, sir, but there was a lot of chaos.
Is it a hostage situation?
Seems like it, sir.
But no demands have been made yet.
Some staff informed us that several civilians
and foreign nationals are stuck inside.
Where is Farooq?
He's injured, sir.
And we've lost three of our men.
Are you out of your mind, Farooq?
How could you just barge in without any planning?
No bullet-proof jackets or helmets?
-Sir, I was just trying to do my best-- -Don't give lame excuses!
Who will be accountable for the three dead officers?
-Sir, we don't have new gear. -New gears?
Rats have chewed out the old ones.
You don't even know this, sir.
Now that you've blamed the department, are you satisfied?
Sorry, sir.
Did anyone take responsibility for this attack?
Not yet, sir. But it could be Ansar-Ul-Islam.
Isn't it the same group
that killed the editor of Roopabaan Magazine a few days ago?
Bloody uneducated assholes!
I wonder what godforsaken religious school they pick this from.
How many people are inside?
We don't have the exact number, but around ten people.
They used an AK.
-Do me a favor. -Yes, sir.
-Get me a blueprint of the cafe. -Sure, sir.
Let's show these swine their rightful place in Bangladesh.
Sir.
-Don't just stand there. Go get it! -Sure, sir.
Where can we find the blueprint?
Blueprint, sir?
Yes, the blueprint he just mentioned.
I thought you would know.
You don't know where to get the blueprint?
No, sir.
Then why did you say yes?
Even you said yes, sir.
Find the blueprint.
-Bikash. -Yes.
Get your phone and click pictures of the bodies.
Show.
Show.
I'm not getting the vibe.
They look quite ordinarily dead.
Wait.
Now.
Wait, give me the phone.
You, rock star.
-Come here. -What the fuck are you doing?
Stop fucking around and just take the pictures.
Dude, I know what I'm doing, okay?
Come on. Quick. Now.
Bend over her neck.
Bend over her neck.
Down. Lean closer.
-Bend down. -What are you making me do, brother?
Bend over now.
On her neck.
Please, bro.
Smile.
Please!
Come on. Smile.
Smile. Teeth.
Good boy.
That's more like it.
What is he doing?
Show it to me.
Download Wickr and send the pictures to Brother Rajeev.
Rest of you, back to positions.
Hello, ma'am. This is Shahbaaz from Dhaka Care.
We're offering life insurance…
Yes, Ma'am. Can I get your details?
Thank you, ma'am.
Hold on for a minute, and I'll share the details with you.
Yes.
This is the center,
and this is right and left.
-Sir… -Over here…
Excuse me, sir, but according to the directions,
this should be left and this right.
Don't get confused with right and left. We can enter from here.
And over here…
Sir, he's Anwar Mehendi.
So?
Sir, he's the owner of the cafe.
Mr. Anwar, did you get the blueprint?
Sir, I looked all over, but couldn't find it.
Are you sure you didn't hand it to the terrorists?
Sorry, sir?
You know what, Farooq, take him along,
and make a layout of the cafe.
And set up a command post. Okay?
And, don't leave him alone. Go.
Sir, I am here to help.
Then help us! Quick, get out of here.
-He's so rude. -Come.
Come on.
-Get two teams ready. -Sir.
Let's finish them off.
There are civilians inside, sir.
Wouldn't it be better to be careful?
This is the Commissioner of Police.
I repeat, this is the Police Commissioner.
The cops have surrounded you.
There's no way to escape.
We're ready to hear your demands.
Release all the hostages safe and sound.
I repeat, there's no way to escape.
Who the fuck has written this?
Sir, it is a standard protocol.
We'll be okay.
We'll be safe.
We'll get out.
This is the Police Commissioner speaking.
Release all the hostages safe and sound.
We're ready to hear your demands.
I repeat.
We're ready to hear your demands.
Sir, SWAT, and RAB teams
-are on their way. -So are we supposed
to swat mosquitoes until then?
Yes, Rabia, I can hear you.
Yes. We're right here.
Come near the barricades.
Yeah, I'm right in the crowd. Yeah.
Come. Come here.
There she is.
Where are the children?
-Are the children okay? -Dr. Mujahid is trying to get
through the commissioner. The kids will come out safe.
Just hang in there.
Sir, this is the main gate,
and this is the boundary wall.
Please move your hand.
-Go on. -This leads to the parking area, sir.
And this is the lake area,
and this is the lawn.
This is the cafe's entry.
This is the seating area.
And this is the courtyard.
And the kitchen is over here.
But we were told that the kitchen is somewhere here.
Oh!
-Sorry, sir. But this is the kitchen. -Are you sure you own the cafe?
-Sorry, sir. -Your job here is done.
Go on. Leave.
Go on.
-Everyone, come here. -Sir.
Listen carefully.
Team one will enter with me from the main gate,
and we'll try to divert their attention.
Clear?
Team two will jump into the lawn from the side,
and take them by surprise.
-Clear to everyone? -Yes, sir.
Let's surround the assholes from both sides.
But sir, you'll be directly in the line of fire.
No wonder I'm the Police Commissioner.
What is he still doing here?
Out! Someone escort him out.
No one enters the war room without my permission.
Sure, sir.
Staff! Where's the switchboard?
Line everyone up. Line them up in front of the windows.
Bikash, Khairul, quick! Come on!
Quick, get up.
Against the window, go.
Come on. Khairul!
Go on. To the back.
What are you doing?
-Do you want to get shot again? -What kind of question is that?
Shut the fuck up and do what I'm telling you to do.
I'm protecting you here.
Go, stand there.
Moba, main door.
Khairul, all good?
And you, on the main door. Go.
You two, come here.
Come here.
You'll be fine. Come with me.
You'll be fine.
Under the stairs. Come on.
Do you want to stand in front of the windows?
Come here.
Be careful. Come here.
Under the stairs. Nothing will happen.
Slow down. Go under the stairs.
Hide under it.
You, against the window.
My hand, dude.
Doctor, check him.
Grew a fucking beard, you should've grown a pair while you were at it.
We will see when you get shot.
Hey, long hair. Against the main door.
Go fast.
How much longer? Hello!
Hello, Tari?
Dad…
Tari, I can't hear you.
Give me the phone.
Hello, Uncle.
Faraaz here.
Yes.
We'll get out safe and sound.
Call my mom…
-and tell her we will get out-- -Please, Faraaz.
Teach your kids some manners.
They're taking my politeness for granted.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
How brainwashed are you!
You're brainwashed.
Everyone in this circus has been brainwashed.
When everyone is gone from this world…
we will be remembered.
Just watch.
Move!
Move in, boys. Move in.
I want men stationed at every corner of this area.
Assailants in sight.
Cover every inch of this place.
-Give me a visual. -Sir.
-Copy. -We were just waiting for you, sir.
DMP should not have attacked!
Sir.
I tried, sir.
Keep an eye on the target.
If anything, let me know immediately.
I tried to reason with the Commissioner, but…
Now you guys have made our job even more difficult!
I want men stationed there.
What is the ETA on RAB?
They should be here any moment, sir.
Boys, any activity, report in.
-Negative. -I do not want any fuck up this time.
Where is the command post?
This way, sir.
I need water.
Wait.
Hey!
Go, look after your kids.
Go sit with them.
Dad, water.
We'll drink once we get home.
I don't want to be here.
Let's go home, Dad.
We'll drink water,
have a burger, and even watch a movie together, okay?
I promise.
What's your fucking problem, you creep?
Stop throwing English words at me.
-She's abusing me in English, man. -Careful, Mobu.
-Or she will slap you again. -Look after yourself first.
You got shot.
Getting shot is glorious, okay.
-You got slapped by a fucking chick! -I will…
Hey!
Avoid.
Avoid him.
Go and stand there.
Go there.
Go.
And Faraaz, if I shoot her in the face for talking too much,
it will be on you.
Okay?
I am currently at Gulshan Chaar Rasta.
This is the same area where
an unfathomable attack has taken place.
-The Bangalesh Police -My daughter's in there.
-is not taking any further steps. -There's nothing we can do, sir.
-You have to wait here. -My name is Sudhir Sen.
-I can understand. -I am from India. I am not a local.
I dropped my daughter off at the cafe. When I came back, this had happened.
-Please, sir. -There's nothing we can do, sir.
-Please leave. -Let me talk to your senior?
I will request him.
-Maybe he'll listen to me. -It's not allowed, sir. Please go.
No one's allowed now, sir, please.
Please leave.
Stand back, please.
Please.
No one is allowed to enter the premises.
And we have a person here with us.
Sir, we had some questions. Is any of your kin in there?
My daughter's in there. I left her here.
And I came back to this terror.
-What is her name? -Tarika Sen.
When did you last talk to her?
-A while ago. -Did you meet her inside the cafe?
I am telling you I dropped my daughter off here.
How could you leave her in such a situation?
Why would I intentionally leave my daughter here?
I went out for some work. When I came back, this was going on.
As you can see,
-the situation here is tense. -How dare you ask me such a question?
-The cops have no answers yet… -I am here.
-and there's anger among people. -I am right here.
Yes, please note it.
Faraaz Ayaaz Hussain.
Yes. Grandson of Lateef-Ul-Rehman.
Yes, grandson.
-Yes. -Excuse me.
Yes, I'm right here.
Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you.
-Are you Faraaz's mother? -Yes.
I am Tarika's dad.
Sudhir. Sudhir Sen.
-Mr. Sen, yes. -Yes.
Faraaz and Tarika are stuck inside together.
I know, Mr. Sen.
Don't worry. The kids will come out safely.
-Dr. Mujahid, Mr. Sen. -Yes.
Dr. Mujahid is the CEO of our pharma company.
This is Zaraif, my older son.
She's… Ayesha's mother, Rabia.
We're all trying our best.
But we haven't been able to talk to the kids yet.
I actually spoke to Faraaz.
Is he fine?
He's fine.
He said not to worry, and that they'll all come out safely.
That's my son.
Manirul.
We have our men stationed in all the buildings
around Holey Artisan's perimeter.
Snipers are manning the roof,
but unfortunately, we don't have a clear vision yet.
How many terrorists are in there?
No idea, sir.
Captives?
No idea, sir.
Benazir, good you're here.
Let's regroup and attack again.
I guess there aren't more than five terrorists inside.
-We can-- -You guess?!
Thanks to you, we've already lost 12 officers.
He's right, sir.
We cannot plan another failed attack.
What else should we do?
We can't just sit on our hands while our people remain captive inside.
You're injured. It'd be better if you step back.
We'll make a plan keeping the civilians in mind.
We made the plan keeping the civilians in mind.
Sir, stop calling your stupidity a plan.
Mind your language, Benazir.
Sir, let's discuss the way ahead.
We've blocked all the routes.
Okay.
Will you show me Holey Artisan's layout?
Sure.
What is this?
Where is the blueprint?
This is all we have.
Seriously?
Wow!
Isn't this amazing?
Who is this local Picasso?
Commissioner, send a recon team.
They will assess the situation around the cafe,
and report to me.
RAB will join SWAT on the rooftop, and windows for maximum visuals.
The rest will be ground support.
Manirul, we will lead.
SWAT will attack from the front,
and RAB will enter from back here.
And what about DMP?
DMP will be the back up team and give us cover fire when required.
If any armed terrorist comes out, shoot at sight.
Sir.
And Manirul, there's something else you need to know as well.
After the operation…
I want this framed.
Ma'am, he's SI Farooq.
Inspector?
Why should I be speaking to an Inspector?
-Where is the commissioner? -Ma'am, he's a little bit busy.
Look, we've been waiting for a long time.
This is Rabia. This is Mr. Sen from India.
Our kids are stuck inside.
We're here to cooperate with you,
and to give you all sorts of moral support.
-But we also need to know-- -Thank you.
Thank you for all that, ma'am.
If you need anything, you can tell me.
Or you can tell Dr. Mujahid.
-Yes, it will be taken care of. -Whatever they require.
Absolutely. It will be taken care of.
But how long will this rescue operation take?
We're trying, ma'am.
Yes, but it's been over three hours, and now people are beginning to panic.
Ma'am, there are 50 people stuck inside the cafe.
All we're trying to do is make sure,
that everybody comes out safely, that's it.
Of course!
But there's got to be a plan of action, right?
-Please let us do our job. -I'm sure you can do it better.
These are terrorists,
and our children are inside.
And many more innocent people, and…
Should we just blow up the cafe then?
Everyone will be dead. Game over! That's it.
Everybody goes home?
Twelve officers are dead, ma'am.
I'm injured but still on duty. Do you know why?
Why?
Only to make sure everyone comes out safely.
But no, you know it better.
Please do it for us.
Sir, please.
-Please, sir… -Please let us do our job!
As you can see the RAB and SWAT teams have reached the spot.
Per our sources, many DMP officers are severely injured.
We have to wait and see how exactly the hostages will be rescued.
This attack in the country's diplomatic area
has been termed Bangladesh's biggest terrorist attack to date.
So far, no terrorist organization has claimed responsibility for it.
This is Mohammad Sami-Ull reporting for ATN News.
Nibras, any message from Brother Rajeev?
We will get it soon.
Complicated network.
Dude, I got shot in the hand.
We're risking our lives here.
The least he can do is reply on time.
Hey, long hair.
Everyone's sleepy. Play something.
And none of that Bob Dylon, John Lennon bullshit.
Khairul, do you have any requests?
For you, my heart pines
What about that one?
I don't know the chords.
What do you know?
I play my own songs.
Really?
One of those.
Play something.
I--
I remained quiet
And resilient
Even as God stood witness To the atrocities
I stayed empathetic
And untainted
And yet I felt suffocated
Can't do it. I'm not a professional singer.
I only write songs.
So what? They are not here for a concert.
Just sing.
Sing.
I swear I'll never set up a date for anyone again.
Clouds of smoke and gunpowder Faces smeared in blood
But who will hear
My heart's woes?
I've seen monsters turn into men
There's a sea of pain inside of me
Slowly chipping away at the pieces
Of my heart
Nobody stood up
Nobody called them out
Even God stood witness
To the atrocities
I remained quiet and resilient
Even God stood witness
To the atrocities
You were right.
You're definitely not a professional singer.
I'm kidding! Go sit.
A round of applause.
Come on, louder!
Go and sit down.
Team Theta, you will throw stun grenades inside the cafe,
to make way for Team Alpha to enter.
-Copy! -Yes, sir.
Try to lure the terrorists out,
and then get them.
Ensure that none of the hostages are hurt in the crossfire.
-Clear? -Yes, sir!
He's blaming me for everything.
Now they are doing the same thing.
Doesn't matter which point you enter from,
you'll be spotted anyway.
-I was right in front of them. -Sir.
-Sir. -What is it?
Ma'am is on the line.
Tell ma'am there's been a terrorist attack.
-I'll be late for dinner. -The Prime Minister.
What?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes.
-Mushtaq. -Sir.
What?
Why are they coordinating with you?
They should be calling me.
Why don't you call her yourself then?
When there was time to negotiate, you attacked.
Now when we're prepared to attack, you want us to negotiate?
It's not me who's saying this.
These are her orders.
Directly from the PM.
Alright then, let's get some coffee and snacks.
Let's "follow" orders.
There were two of my other staff, who jumped from the roof.
And my other staff, they got shot.
I just want to go to the embassy.
Do you want to go to the embassy?
Yes, I want to go to the embassy of my country.
Hey, you guys, those near the windows.
Come and sit.
Come on, stand against the window.
Stand against the wall.
Sit comfortably on the chair.
You, go stand in front of the window.
Doctor, against the wall.
Hey, you two. Come and sit here.
Hey, you've rested enough. Go.
Go stand there in front of the wall and take these two with you.
You go and stand against that window.
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.
If only I had left for Malaysia, we wouldn't be here.
It's all my fault.
As if it was your fault that the ink got over.
I'm sorry. You guys came to see me.
Don't say that.
It was my plan to come here.
I am sorry.
You know, snow isn't a problem in most Islamic countries.
But "ISIS".
Terrorist jokes, really?
You shouldn't be joking like this.
Sorry.
I couldn't think of anything else.
Nibras.
Confirm and tell me how many are dead.
-Moba, outside. Bikash, upstairs. -Wait, I'll count.
No. You just watch them.
You stay here to guard. I will do the counting.
Why don't you count this?
Go count, and hurry up.
One.
"In the name of Allah, the most gracious and the most merciful.
Oh, Allah.
By the Quran, full of wisdom.
You are indeed one of the messengers."
Two.
"I worship you, the three-eyed Lord Shiva.
The one who is fragrant and has nourished all beings."
Three.
You count yours.
"On a straight path.
It is a revelation sent down by Him.
You may warn those whose forefathers weren't warned, they are unaware.
-Of the signs of Allah." -Four.
"Free me from the bondage
of this worldly life.
Free me from the fear of death.
-by making me realize…" -Five.
How many?
Fourteen.
Six.
-Sir, he's… -Sir, we live close by.
My daughter Fairuz is stuck inside!
Please get her out.
We're trying our best.
Give me your daughter's number.
Whose is it?
Whose phone is it?
Who is it?
It's an unknown number.
Come. Come here.
I won't hurt you. Come here!
Fast.
Answer the call.
Put it on loudspeaker.
-Hello. -Fairuz.
This is Benazir Ahmed speaking from RAB.
Is everyone alright?
Can I talk to someone?
What the fuck are you doing?
-Dude, it's the fucking RAB… -What the fuck is wrong with you?
-RAB, dude. They're going to screw us. -Shut the fuck up!
They are going to fuck us!
Just shut the fuck up!
Call them back and put it on the loudspeaker.
Fucking idiot.
-Hello. -Hello.
Tell him he's on the loudspeaker.
Uncle, you're on the loudspeaker.
This is DG RAB.
Tell me your demands.
I'll consider them.
I know you're scared as well,
because I would be too.
Think calmly.
I just want to know your point of view.
I'm sure you did it for a specific reason.
And for that you need to come out.
And I assure you no one will harm you.
Hello?
Hello?
Turn on the TV.
Bikash, Mobashir, come here.
Also you, idiot.
We begin with breaking news…
Breaking news, terror attack…
Gunmen walked into the Holey…
Heavily armed militants…
Terror attack in a restaurant…
Dhaka is shaken.
-ISIS. -ISIS…
ISIS is claiming responsibility…
ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack,
and declared that 19 people are dead,
including foreign nationals.
Through their official mouthpiece Amaq Agency,
they have also shared pictures of the terrorists,
who are still present inside the cafe.
These five terrorists are believed to be Bangladeshi nationals.
According to reports, the names of these five terrorists are,
Nibras Islam, Rohan Imtiaz,
Khairul Payel, Meer Mobashir, and Bikash Shafiqul.
We don't have any information on the sixth terrorist seen in the picture,
but we'll be closely following this developing story.
This…
They handed guns to children on a jummah.
And these assholes claim to be the custodians of Islam.
Have you guys shut their internet service?
-Sir, the chaos-- -Chaos?
You guys are trained officers, Manirul.
How can you forget basic protocol?
I'll get it done right away, sir.
Do you have tech support or that was also forgotten in the chaos?
We do, sir.
He's trying to hack the CCTV.
-Get it done. -Sir.
Why doesn't the PM get it?
We have to attack now.
In terrorism and claim-making, it's the optics that matter.
And right now, the Bangladesh government
is bowing down helplessly before a bunch of kids.
Hey, long hair, come here.
Does anyone have any network on their phone?
Check it.
No.
I don't.
No?
They have jammed the network.
What?
How will we coordinate with Brother Rajeev?
Staff.
You.
What's the Wi-Fi password?
Holeyartisan12345.
Holeyartisan12345?
You guys are pretty serious about your security.
Bloody losers.
They've shut down mobile data but broadband is working at full speed.
Boys, we have received a message from Brother Rajeev.
"I am so proud of you.
You've delivered more than we expected.
There's a special place for you reserved in heaven now.
You've proved that even Muslims from Bangladesh
are ahead in the war for Islam.
See you soon in paradise. Love you all."
On this note, let's take a selfie.
Take his phone.
Take his phone.
Yes.
Open it.
-Hold it. -No, please…
-Why are you doing this to me? -Hold it.
Smile.
-Who are you? How did you get in? -Sir, she's Lateef-Ul-Rehman's daughter.
-So? Who allowed her? -She has permission from the Ministry.
Our kids are inside.
I've been standing out here for hours. There are other parents too--
Look ma'am, you guys are not allowed in here.
Why am I not allowed here?
-My son is stuck in there! -Ma'am, we're working on a plan of action.
-Please move away! -What plan of action?
You're doing nothing. You're chilling, smoking a cigarette.
My son's stuck in there all night.
If you guys are incapable, then let me know.
-I will go in. -Get them out here.
-What? -Sir, please try to understand.
Please.
I will get you suspended!
I will call the PM right now
-and get you suspended! -Mom, wait.
If you speak to the PM, please let me know.
-I will get you suspended. -Leave.
-Just wait and watch! -Please, mom.
-Please try to understand. -You just watch. Just wait.
-Take them away. -Sir, please try to understand.
-Her son's stuck in there… -No one!
You are not allowed and that's final.
-Sir… -This is not some cricket match,
where you can sneak in through the VIP quota,
and get a gold pass to go in. Leave.
Get him.
-Bring him back. -What are you guys doing there?
It's okay.
I'll suspend everyone if anyone else comes in.
Please bring Chhotu back.
Thank you.
Have it.
What's your name?
Hasnath.
Do you vote?
Yeah.
What's the point?
Did your government show up to save you?
The Khalifa from Levant, Iraq has called out to Muslims from around the world.
We need to bring back those who have deviated from the path of Sharia.
And kill the infidels.
"All who obey Allah and the messenger,
will be in the company of those on whom
the Allah has graced,
of the prophets who teach
the sincere lovers of truth,
the witnesses who testify,
and the righteous who do good."
What beautiful company!
Do you know what it means?
Those who obey…
Not the one you've mugged up.
Those who believe in the Grace of Allah
will be enlisted among those special ones whom Allah has personally blessed.
Nabi-e-Kareem Mohammad.
Our Great Prophet, may Allah honor him,
and grant the martyrs peace.
Wow! What a company to be in!
Even he's parroting what he's been fed.
What are you saying?
He's making it sound like Allah has made an executive club,
and he's getting a gold membership.
That's such a bad analogy.
They think
they get blessings by killing the innocent.
Are you hungry?
Moba.
There should be pastries and croissants at the counter. Have a look.
It's covered in blood.
Staff.
Where do you keep the food?
Get out.
Please.
Please.
Don't kill.
Hello.
-Hello, Dad. -Hello.
Nobody is helping us here.
Please do something.
I've done everything I could.
We are helpless. We can't go against God's will.
How can we not?!
You have to do something!
I don't care!
Do whatever it takes!
Call the Defense Minister. Call the army.
If you have to sell everything to pay them off, do it.
I… want my Chhotu back right now.
Otherwise, I'll never show you my face again, I'm telling you!
My dear, all we can do is pray that our boy comes out safe.
Leave him.
Why?
I spared his life.
What do you mean?
I mean, I spared his life.
Dude, you're impossible.
So Mr. Chef, what's your name?
Sardar.
But it says Sarkar here.
It's a misprint.
It's Sardar Khan.
Sardar Khan.
So, Chef Sardar Khan, what will you cook for us?
Are we going to have food before we leave?
Where are we going?
It's time for the morning prayers, everyone must be hungry.
Come on, go with him.
And you, sit down there.
On your knees.
Can you keep that away?
I'm getting scared.
Moba, do you have your phone?
Chef, give me your phone.
I want to play games.
Do you have Temple Run?
Yes… no.
Give it!
Do you think we're here to steal phones?
Sarkar.
Keep cooking.
You know, there was a time when Islam ruled the world.
All the Muslims lived in golden palaces.
We had the best clothes, the best food, and the best toys.
Come on.
Come.
We made big missiles,
and our army was the strongest.
Hey, Hiroshima!
Here, on your knees.
Come, sit.
Then some folks got jealous of us.
Hold the gun.
Please.
No.
And they took everything from us.
Don't you want all of it back?
Stop.
Stop it!
He's a kid.
Exactly.
Are you okay?
The sooner he knows what it means to be a Muslim,
it will be better for all of us.
Wielding a gun and being a Muslim is the same for you?
Hey!
Try being a human first,
then talk about what it means to be a Muslim.
My friend, everyone that died here,
-deserved to die. -Why?
-Because they were infidels. -Like you?
You're no one to call me that,
you fucking whore around with these…
-What the fuck did you say? -Shut the fuck up, you bitch!
A person who doesn't know the basics of the Islamic way of life--
Stop it!
Basics?
You'll teach us the basics of the Islamic way of life?
Peace, harmony, and the sanctity of human life.
None of these things, but killing?
Killing people in the name of Allah,
is that what Islam is for you?
We have a Twitter debater here.
What school did you go to?
American School, right?
Where did you graduate from?
Some fancy American University?
So that's what they taught you there.
How to finish off Islam?
That is all you know.
It's written in the Quran.
Yeah.
Ijtihad.
It means reasoning.
Allah wants us to question, doubt, and challenge.
But how would you know? You've not even read the Quran, right?
No need to teach me anything. I know everything.
They made a fool of you.
They cherry-picked some verses, gave them a twisted interpretation,
and handed you a gun.
They taught you violence, not Islam.
Watch it. I wasn't taught anything, it was my choice to be here.
Do you not see, bro?
Islam is under threat.
In America, Obama has awarded himself the Nobel Peace Prize,
while he is bombing us in seven countries?
Palestine doesn't belong to the Palestinians.
Kashmir doesn't belong to the Kashmiris.
Our people are getting killed every single day in Yemen.
Millions of us are being caged in China's detention camps
People climb on mosques and demolish them, and then call Muslims violent.
People don't even consider us humans.
Is this the kind of world you want to live in?
And by doing all this will you stop the cycle?
We suffer because of people like you.
Everyone thinks we're violent radicals, just like you.
-Just-- -If they target us, we will hit back!
This is a message to every Bangladeshi.
We're opening up a new battlefront here.
Oh, don't think of yourself as a revolutionary.
Bangladesh was built on different ideas, not your screwed-up ideologies.
What's his name?
Bikash.
What's his name? Rohan.
Muslim boys with Hindu names.
Our identity comes from our culture, and not our religion alone.
You wouldn't know. You're not even a true Muslim.
I am a soldier of Islam.
I am how every Muslim should be!
You're a bully with a gun,
who wanted to feel special one night.
Faraaz!
-No, stop. -Get down.
Leave him!
Please stop.
Please.
Allah is the greatest.
Allah is the greatest.
Allah is the greatest.
Allah is the greatest.
Boys, going out for a final smoke.
Nibras, listen.
We've already achieved what we wanted to from this operation.
Why do we have to die, dude?
You know why we came here.
Listen.
The army must have arrived now. RAB is already here.
We don't know what's out there. We'll get fucked.
You're getting shit scared, right?
You're freaking scared.
How dare you point your gun at me, Mobashir!
Sister.
It's me, Nibras.
Dude, Nibras, what are we waiting for?
Let's get the hell out of here.
Just wait downstairs. I'm coming.
What's the plan?
How do we escape?
We made a decision when we came here.
We're not running away.
But why not?
The cops are here!
We're in front of a lake.
I can swim. We all can.
Dude, let's go. We'll swim to the other side.
We'll settle down in Malaysia with our parents.
We're not going anywhere, okay?
We're going to paradise.
You're going to paradise.
I am going out.
You can leave.
Go on. I promise you'll be fine.
Tell everyone outside that we took good care of you all.
Take them to the war room.
Take them to the first aid room.
Catch him. The one with the long hair.
Have you seen her?
Look.
-Have you seen her? -Have you seen him?
Yes, I have.
-He was with his two friends? -Yes.
-Where did you see them? -Inside the cafe. I don't know.
Okay, fine.
Excuse me.
Have you seen him?
Please, wait. Have you seen him?
They let Muslims go,
and only killed the foreigners.
These girls can't leave.
You've quite a temper, right?
I am sorry.
She hit one of us.
But you prayed with me.
Faraaz… go.
We'll be fine.
Go.
I can't leave without them.
What the fuck is your problem?
What do you want, man?
I want my Islam back from people like you.
Great.
You'll be an example for the rest of the Muslims.
Fine, I can live with that.
No!
In a world far away from our own
In a promised land beyond this realm
In another universe
I hope you've found a safe home
Kinder than the one you've foregone
Where the carefree ones live
In a world far away from our own
In another universe
I hope, my dear, you've found a home
-We'll avenge the murders… -By spilling their blood.
-We'll avenge the murders… -By spilling their blood.
-We'll avenge the murders… -By spilling their blood.
-We'll avenge the murders… -By spilling their blood.
-We'll avenge the murders… -By spilling their blood.
I did nothing, sir.
I wasn't…
I did nothing, sir. Sir, please.
Ask my parents, sir.
I'm just a student, sir. Please.
Where people don't look For religion in a name In a world far away from our own
In a world far away from our own In a new universe
In a new universe
I hope you've found a safe home
Chhotu always followed his heart.
He was stubborn.
Never agreed on anything easily.
MOTHER TERESA MEMORIAL AWARDS FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE, 2016
Now I wish…
even if to argue with me, once…
if he could just come back.
I was there.
Right there.
But…
I--
I couldn't save him.
It all seems so unreal, so unfair.
How can I continue living…
when my child is no more?
The moment I found out
that no foreigner had survived.
I realized…
that my son won't walk out.
He won't walk out…
without his friends…
Ayesha and Tarika.
What those five kids did…
or whoever made them do it.
Because of people like them, the world keeps saying,
"See, they did it yet again.
This is just how their community is."
But my Chhotu proved…
not all battles are fought to be won.
Some are just fought so the world can remember…
that when there was injustice…
someone stood up against it.
Those officers stood against them.
My Chhotu stood up against them.
I know you can hear me, Chhotu.
I want you to know…
that your mother is very proud of you.
Because now I know…
it takes a mob…
to divide the world.
But to keep it united…
one adorable… loving…
child is enough.
His very name…
Faraaz.
Means someone who stands tall.
