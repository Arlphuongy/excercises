Did you, um... Did you set the alarm before we left?
Yeah, it was the last thing I did.
No, I was the last one to leave.
I was the last one to leave and I'm sure I didn't set it.
No, darling. I was the last one out.
And I did. I promise. You sure?
-Yeah. -Okay.
No, no, I was the last one, because I went back in.
And that means the alarm is not set. -Because I didn't set it. -Well...
-Because I didn't set it. -Well... I guess that means we'll be coming home
to a large bunch of hippies sleeping in our bed.
What? Just like your old college days?
-[rumbling] -[gasps]
It's all right. It's fine. It's just turbulence, Maria.
[female announcer on PA] Ladies and gentlemen,
we are about to begin our descent into Phuket Airport.
The local time is 1:30 in the afternoon...
What are you doing? It's time to sit down.
-We're about to land, darling. -Lucas won't talk to me.
We ask that you fasten your seatbelt
We ask that you fasten your seatbelt and return your seat to the upright position.
Take my seat.
What did I do? I didn't do anything.
It's all right. Just sit down and stop worrying. Buckle up.
[Stewardess] sit down, please, madame.
Lucas...
-Lucas. -What?
You know, you could try being a bit nicer to your brother. He's just scared.
So what else is new? Everything scares him.
I wonder who he takes after.
[Maria] All right.
Take your stuff. Don't forget all your bags.
[Maria] Thomas! Your bag.
[man] Have you been to Khao Lak before? [Henry] No, it's our first time.
[man] This is the best holiday season ever.
All resorts are full, but this area is really quiet.
It's great for families.
The Orchid Beach Resort is brand new. We just opened a week ago. You'll love it here.
We just opened a week ago. You'll love it here. All right.
[Maria] I'm sorry, but we made a booking on the third floor.
The Sea View Room. [man] I know. We are sorry. That was a mistake.
[man] I know. We are sorry. That was a mistake. But we feel you might like this better.
But we feel you might like this better.
-Where do you come from? -[Henry] Japan.
[man] You don't look Japanese.
[man] You don't look Japanese. [Henry] No, well, I work for a big company there and we move around a lot. You know?
And you? You don't work? I'm a doctor.
I'm not practicing right now. Just taking care of the kids.
I see. You got promoted.
[Henry] Oh, that's nice, isn't it?
-Mom! -Yes?
Can I have one of these, please?
Lucas, if you're thirsty, will you just...
[all] Drink some juice or a glass of water. [Maria] Exactly.
[Henry] Boys, come and see this.
-Come on. -Look.
Oh, yeah, look. Look at this. Isn't it great? Yeah?
[Simon] Dad? Can we swim in there? [Henry] Yeah, we can go swimming. Yeah.
[all] Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.
Blast off!
[Thomas] That one isn't going up!
-[Maria] Yes, it is. -[Henry] It is going up.
[Thomas] No, it's not.
It's going a different way than the others.
It's going all the way up now.
-It's catching up! -Yeah, it's catching up.
[Lucas] No, Dad, it's going in the opposite direction.
We got any of that wine left?
[Maria whispering] They're fast asleep.
[Henry] Hey, baby.
[Henry] Simon, wake up, wee man.
Good morning.
Good morning. -[Lucas] Get off! -[Henry laughing]
Wake up!
-What are you doing? -[Simon] It's Christmas!
[Henry] It's Christmas morning! It's Christmas!
Coins!
The money's leading this way.
Oh, the money's going outside! [Maria] No, no, no!
Wait, wait! One at a time!
[all] Oh!
[Henry] Oh, a telescope!
Oh, it's the complete nova stars... It's like, you can stick on your ceiling.
-It's the whole Milky Way. -And then they light up?
Oh, look at this gorgeous scarf! I love it.
Thank you, darling.
[Henry] That's all right, my love. I mean Santa Claus.
[Henry] What have you got, wee man?
-[Simon] A ball. -[Henry] A ball?
[Henry] Come on! The ball!
[Thomas] Oh, yes!
I can't get to sleep.
Must be jet lag. [Maria] Yeah. Sure.
Can we go outside and watch the stars?
Maybe tomorrow.
Shh. Just close your eyes and think of something nice.
One all. -Mom! -Hi.
Come play ball with me.
In a minute, darling. Play with Lucas.
Can't believe you.
-You're hopeless. -What?
I'm gonna hide that thing and forget where I put it.
I was just checking to see about the house -we put a bid on in Japan. -[chuckling] Liar.
-we put a bid on in Japan. -[chuckling] Liar.
The truth is I got a text
saying that Yunioshi has been given a two-year extension on his contract.
Which means there will be two of us doing the same job.
And that can only really mean one thing. They can't fire you.
That would be too expensive. Don't worry.
Well, I do worry because we can't afford to lose this job, can we?
[Lucas] Hey, Dad! Come and play with us!
I could go back to work. Maybe it's time.
-In Japan? -No.
Oh, you want to go home?
It's not the worst idea, is it?
Well, we should think about it.
But I'm gonna play with the boys now, so...
[Lucas] Here, Dad!
Dad, they are the worst trunks ever!
-Awful! -[Thomas] They're awful, Dad!
-No, you're the awful! -[Simon] Yes, they are!
-[Henry] Boys! Oh! -[Simon] Fish!
-[Thomas] Try to splash 'em! -[Lucas] Ha, ha, beat you!
[Henry] Lucas!
[Henry] Oh, no! Go get it, Lucas! Go on!
-Henry, the boys! -Lucas!
Dad!
Lucas!
[Lucas] Mom! Help!
-Lucas! -Mom!
-Lucas! -Help me!
Lucas!
Help me! Help!
Get me out of this, Mom!
Lucas! Stay there!
Mom!
Hold on! Hold on!
Mom!
-Mom! Swim towards me! -Be careful!
Grab that mattress!
-Lucas, swim to the mattress! -Mom!
Lucas! Swim!
Mom!
Mom!
-I want to go home! -Grab my hand!
-I want to go home! -Grab my hand! Mom!
[Lucas] Come on! Grab on. -Mom! -Lucas!
-Mom! -Lucas!
Lucas!
Lucas! Come on!
Lucas!
-Lucas! -Mom!
[man] Someone help! Someone help!
[Maria] Lucas!
Lucas, go under!
Mom!
Mom... Mom!
No...
Mom!
Mom. Mom.
Mom... Mom!
Mom!
-Lucas! -Mom!
Never do that to me again, Mom.
Never do that to me again, Mom.
-I'm here. -Never do that to me again.
We have to find somewhere safe.
It's okay. I'm here.
Mom...
Mom, look, that tree. That tree over there.
Yes. Yes. Yes, it's perfect. It's perfect.
Careful, Lucas.
Don't... Don't move.
Stay really still.
I thought I was a brave kid, Mom.
I'm scared.
Come here. Come here.
I'm scared, too.
Is it over?
Is it over?
I don't know. I don't know.
Mom?
What?
You're bleeding, Mom.
[Maria whimpering] Oh, God.
It's okay.
-I can't see you like this. -[Maria] It's okay, it's okay.
Sorry. I just... Sorry.
[Maria] You go first.
That tree there, the big one. Do you think we can climb it?
Okay, let's go.
-Wait. Did you hear that? -[screaming continues]
-There's nothing we can do. -Wait...
We are almost there. We have to get to safety.
No, we have to help that boy.
Mom, if another wave catches us down here, we will die.
We have to climb that tree right now. Come on.
Where are you? Mom, look at you! We need help!
Mom, look at you! We need help!
We cannot risk it.
We can't risk it, Mom. Come on.
Listen...
What if that boy was Simon or Thomas?
What if they needed help?
You'd want someone to help them, wouldn't you?
Simon and Thomas are dead!
Even if it's the last thing we do.
[Lucas] Where are you?
Look there, Mom! I see him!
Are you okay?
-Yeah, he's okay. He's okay. -[crying]
What's your name?
I'm Lucas. What's your name?
-Daniel. -Okay, Daniel. Okay, come on.
You're gonna be okay. We're gonna get you out. Okay?
[Maria] Lift him up.
-[screaming] -It's all right.
It's all right.
Are you okay?
Okay. Are you okay?
-[Daniel crying] -It's okay, it's okay!
Don't worry. Everything's okay.
Okay? You stay here. I'll be back. Okay?
Mom, coming down. Just give me a second. No. I can do it.
-No, Mom, I'm coming down. -I can do it, Lucas!
Just stay there. Please.
[Lucas] Mom? Mom...
Okay...
Okay...
Thank you. Thank you.
Did you hear that?
Mom, look! Look, they're coming for us!
[yelling] Hey! Over here!
Go on down, Lucas.
-Lucas... -[man speaking Thai]
Lucas! Please...
[sobbing] Oh, no, no, no! God, please! No...
[weakly] Lucas?
-Lucas? -Mom, I'm here.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thank you.
[sobbing] Thank you...
Thank you. Thank you so much.
My boys...
I cannot see them, my boys...
My boys.
Okay, okay.
Don't let them take me anywhere without you.
Don't worry, Mom. I'm not gonna leave you alone. I promise.
[young man] Bye-bye.
Where's Daniel? Daniel? Daniel. Lucas, where's Daniel?
-I don't know. -Daniel...
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Mom.
Lucas.
[sighing] It's so cold in here.
It's not cold, Mom.
Don't move.
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?
I need some antibiotics. Look in the cupboard.
Oh, God.
I can't read the labels. They're all in Thai.
There's got to be some English. Look...
Look on the sides. Look carefully, Lucas.
Oh, thank God. Oh, please.
See that boy?
I'm all he's got in the world. Do you understand?
I'm a doctor, too. I've got a lot of bleeding.
You've got to stop it, please.
I need some antibiotics. Please help.
[male doctor] Are you okay?
I lost my husband and two children.
If anything happens to me...
What color is it?
-What? -My leg.
Is it still red?
Yeah. It's still red.
-[moans] -What does that mean?
It's good. As long as it doesn't turn black.
Here.
You need to eat something. Eat it.
You're so bossy.
I wonder who I take after.
[Maria] Hello.
What's your name?
My name's Maria. And this is my son, Lucas.
What's your name?
Give her some tangerine.
She must be starving.
Be careful.
-[choking] -Be careful, Lucas.
Turn your head to the side, please. You'll choke if you don't.
Please, please, she needs help. Turn her head.
Help her, Lucas. Help her. Turn her head.
-You okay? -[retching]
-You okay? -[coughing]
-Mom, are you okay? -[gasping]
Mom? Mom? Are you okay? What are you doing?
-Mom, are you okay? -[speaking Thai]
Stop it, Mom! That's enough! Mom, stop it!
-Mom... -[gasping]
Mom, stop it!
Mom? Mom?
[man] Francesca!
Francesca!
Francesca!
[woman] I need to go to the toilet.
Please...
[woman] Please...
Lucas.
Look at this place. It's so busy in here.
You've got to go and do something.
Go and help people. You're good at it.
[Lucas] What do you want me to do? Something.
Anything.
Will you be all right? Come on, Lucas. I'm... [chuckling weakly] I'm not going anywhere.
-I promise. -Okay.

Three! Bernstrom!

No, no, no! You need to stay here. Okay.
I will bring your pappa here. Okay?
No! No, you have to stay here.
You have to stay here because it's a very long way,
and you have to rest. Okay?
-Okay. -Okay.
Bernstrom!
Where's my mom?
Mom?
[yells] Mom!
Mom!
No. No! What are you doing?
No, this is my mom's bed! Get off! No!

Where were you staying?
In the, uh, the Orchid...
The Orchid Beach Resort in Khao Lak.
Was somebody else traveling with you?

Do you know what happened to them?
Is there somebody we could call? Um...
My granddad.
What's his name? Brian. But I don't remember his number.
Brian. But I don't remember his number.
Lucas?
Lucas!
Maria!
Maria!

Lucas!
Maria!
[man on PA] Hotel, we have prepared transport for you.
We have to move to the Sangdee camp.
Move, everyone, please. You can't just stay here.
Hey, man!
You all right? I just need to lie here a minute.
I'll be up in a second. Don't even bother. They're sending trucks
Don't even bother. They're sending trucks to drive us all up to the mountains.
Just hang on tight, all right? They'll be here soon.
Yeah, I know. Can you tell them I'm back?
Yeah, sure. Hold on.
Hey, boys! Your daddy's back!
[Thomas and Simon] Dad! Dad! Dad!
-Dad! -Dad!
Hey. Dad, a whole lot of helicopters just flew by!
-Did they? -Yeah.
Mom and Lucas?
Why don't you come down here a minute, Thomas.
What about me?
You stay and see if you can see any more helicopters. Okay?
-Okay. -Good boy.
[man] You're almost there, buddy. You got it?
I still haven't found them.
Did you see a lot of dead people?
What happened was very serious, Thomas.
Not Mom and Lucas, right? No, I didn't see them.
I burnt my feet on the roof.
It was really hot, and everyone was leaving. Oh.
Can we leave yet?
I need you to, um...
I need you to do me a favor, Thomas.
I've heard everyone's going to the mountains,
to a shelter where it's really safe.
But I can't go with you.
You can't leave us alone again, Dad.
I have to keep looking for them, you see.
You have to look after Simon... No! No, stay with us. I can't look...
No! No, stay with us. I can't look...
No! No, stay with us. I can't look... I've never looked after someone before. I'm scared.
I've never looked after someone before. I'm scared. I know. I know. I'm scared, too.
I know. I know. I'm scared, too.
But do you know the most scary bit for me?
When the water hit? No. After that.
When I came up, and I was all on my own. That was the scariest part.
And then I saw the two of you clinging to the tree, and I...
I didn't feel so scared anymore, because I knew I wasn't on my own, you see?
What if Mommy and Lucas are on their own right now?
Imagine how scared they'll be.
We'll look for them together. No. Thomas, you have to look after Simon.
No. Thomas, you have to look after Simon. And I'm going to keep looking for them.
Okay?
Okay?
I know you understand.
[man on PA] Everyone move out. You can't stand here.
There might be another wave coming soon. No doubt.
Hello? Yeah, I can hear you.
Nobody knows what's going on.
Are you all right? Have you lost someone?
We're fine. We just want to get out of here.
I'll call you back. Okay? Bye.
Uh, excuse me. I've been trying to place a call back home all day.
I wondered, could I use your phone?
-It would be really quick. -Look around you, man. Everybody's needing something right now.
But our battery is almost dead. We need the phone. [female employee] Yes, as I said,
we are trying to clear the road, but...
[woman] I understand, but I'd like to talk to somebody in charge who knows a little bit more.
[Henry] I'll see you in the morning, okay? You're not coming?
I'm not coming, wee man, no. Thomas will take care of you, all right?
Listen to me. You're gonna behave yourselves, okay?
And you stay with this group,
and I'm gonna be with you just as soon as I can, okay?
You're gonna behave yourselves, okay?
I love you.
Okay.
Will you look out for my boys for me, please?
Come with us. [whispers] You know it's useless.
I can't stop looking.
-[banging on truck] -I love you. I'll be with you tomorrow, I promise.
I love you.
[Henry] Maria!
Lucas!
Maria!
Oh, no. No.
[man] Hey, man, are you okay?
Get in the car. We'll drive you somewhere safer.
[Karl] My wife didn't want to come to Thailand for Christmas holidays,
because of my leg.
I insisted. My little girl, Gina,
she's just two.
The noise woke me up.
I was alone in the room.
I went out to the terrace and saw the sea coming inland.
It took me five seconds to reach the stairs,
but the water was already there.
It was not more than five seconds. [sniffling] On the bed, I found a note from my wife,
[sniffling] On the bed, I found a note from my wife,
saying that they were at the beach.
[man] You were at the Orchid, right? Yeah.
Yeah, my whole family were in the swimming pool when the water hit.
I found my middle son first, Thomas. He was... He was at the top of this really tall tree.
Took me ages to convince him to come down because he was so scared, you know?
And then I found my little one, Simon. He was holding onto a palm tree.
He's only five.
I sent them to the mountains.
You know? So that I could keep looking for my wife and my other son.
Toughest choice I ever made.
-Have you called home yet? -I can't find a phone.
[Karl] I'm saving my battery. Just in case my family calls.
Please.
Thank you. I'll be very quick, I promise.
-Yes? -Brian?
Yes, Henry, thank God. How are you guys?
Did you hear from anyone yet?
No, Henry, you're the first to call. Is everybody all right?
-Henry? -Maria and Lucas are not here.
What do you mean, "not there"?
[sobbing] The water came and swept everyone away.
And I found... I found Thomas and Simon,
but I don't know where Maria and Lucas are.
Henry? Don't do that.
And I don't know what to do, I don't know where to look for them. [sobs]
[Brian] Henry. Henry, calm down. Henry? Henry?
Brian, I have to go. Lots of people need to use this phone, okay?
-I'll just call you later. -Henry?
Sorry. I'm sorry, sorry.
Thank you.
What do you want me to do? You can't leave it like that. Go on!
You can't leave it like that. Go on!
-Come on! -[woman] Go on.
-[man 1] Come on, man. -[man 2] Come on.
I should call him back.
-Yes, Henry? -Brian, it's me again.
Look, I promise you that I won't stop looking -until I find them. Okay? -Okay.
-until I find them. Okay? -Okay. [Henry] I don't know what I'm gonna do
because it's nighttime now, but I'll...
I'll look in all the hospitals. -[Brian] Okay. -And I'll look
-[Brian] Okay. -And I'll look in all the shelters and everything, okay?
I will find them, I promise you that. -I'll call you when I do. -Okay.
-Okay. Okay. -Okay.
[Henry] Thanks.
Can I go with you?
[Simon] I'm scared.
[Thomas] Close your eyes. Think of something nice.
[woman] May I sit with you?
How old are you?
Almost 74. And you?
Seven and a half.
Get these ants off me.
-Is he all right? -Yeah, he's asleep. He's fine.
He's got a bit of ant bites on him. He's all right.
[woman] You like looking at stars, don't you?
I do. At home I can find most of the constellations.
But here in the sky, it's different.
Some of those stars
have been burnt out for a long, long time.
Did you know that?
They're dead, aren't they?
They're dead.
But once they were so bright
that their light is still traveling through space.
We can still see them.
How can you tell which ones are dead and which ones are not?
Oh, you can't. It's impossible.
It's a beautiful mystery, isn't it?
[nurse] Lucas Bennett? Can you come with me?
Sit here.
Your name is Lucas Bennett, is that right?
Yeah.
And your mother's name is Maria Bennett. -Is that correct? -Uh-huh.
-Is that correct? -Uh-huh. We'd like you to look at these things, please,
and see if you recognize any of them.
Have a good look.
Take your time.
[woman] Does anything look familiar?
I don't know.
You don't know?
[woman] Do you recognize anything?
-I don't think so. -You don't think so?
[nurse] Lucas...
Could you please come with us?
[Lucas] Mom.
[weakly] Where the hell have you been?
Where the hell have I been?
Where the hell were you?
You promised me you weren't going anywhere.
You weren't there.
I thought you were dead, Mom.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were dead.
[nurse] We're so sorry.
Someone must have changed her records during surgery.
How is she?
She's had surgery on her chest.
But she lost a lot of blood.
She was too weak to have her leg operated on.
She has to go back to surgery when she recovers.
But she'll be okay, right?
Nothing. What next?
We should, uh...
We should try and get a ride to Takuapa Hospital.
-Where are my kids? -They're taking them away.
They wouldn't let me go with them. I'm sorry.
-Where? -I don't know.
I need to pee. You have to wait, Simon.
Mom. Mom. Lucas...
Mom, guess who I just saw outside?
My leg. What color is my leg?
It's still red.
Please. My mom. Her wounds are looking really bad.
We are doing the best we can.
We are taking your mom to surgery right away.
[driver] No more sick here since yesterday.
It's full. We move out.
No, no, no! Five minutes. Give me five minutes, please.
Please.
I don't want you to slow down.
These are the names of my little girl, Gina, and Kathy, my wife. She's American.
Would you check the list for me? -[Henry] Of course. -[woman] Please.
-[Henry] Of course. -[woman] Please. They told us our daughter could be in Surat Thani.
And we've already been to this hospital.
We have checked all hospitals but this one. Please.
[Henry] Five minutes, please. Just only five minutes.
Okay. I won't be long. I'll be right back.
[weakly] Lucas.
Lucas.
Anything left in the can?
Don't worry. I'll get you something.
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
I need to pee! -Can you hold it? -No.
-Can you hold it? -No.
Simon! What are you doing?
[woman] Boys! Get back on the bus right now!
Hurry up! They're gonna leave us here! What are you doing?
No luck.
Sorry.
Sorry. And thanks for waiting.
[driver] Okay. We go now.
[Thomas] Coming!
-We're coming! -[woman] We have to go now!
Dad! It's Lucas.
-Lucas! -Lucas! -Lucas! -Lucas!
-Lucas! -Lucas! -Lucas! -Lucas!
-Lucas! -Lucas!
Simon! Thomas!
Lucas! Lucas!
Lucas! Thomas! Simon!
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! Lucas!
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas! -Lucas! -Simon!
Searched everywhere...
Simon.
Thomas.
Are you okay?
Lucas!
Dad! Dad...
Dad. Dad?
Lucas!
-Dad! -Lucas!
Dad!
[Thomas and Simon] Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I left you both.
Dad, we did it.
Let's go. No need to wait.
Are you okay? Are you okay?
-[Lucas] Mom is here. -What?
She's really weak. She says some weird stuff sometimes.
The nurse says they're gonna try and operate on her as soon as they can.
I think it's serious.
Mom? Mom.
Look who's here.
Hey, my darling.
[Simon] Mom.
I thought you were all dead. [Henry] We're all okay.
Am I dead? No.
No.
It's okay to take this off?
Here, here, here. I've got it.
-You came back. -Yes.
-You came back. -Yeah.
I can rest now.
Maria, what? What? What, darling?
I'm dying.
No. No.
You're going to be fine.
Take care of our babies. Hey, that's not what I came here for.
You're gonna be fine. They're gonna take good care of you, okay?
I promise you, we're gonna be fine.
Oh, Henry, I'm scared.
We're gonna be fine. Henry...
Henry... Sweetheart, I promise you're gonna be okay.
We're taking her to surgery. We need to take her now.
[Henry] Okay.
I love you.
You're gonna be okay.
I love you so much. I love you.
I love you, Maria. You know that, don't you?
I'm sorry if I let you down in any way.
[Henry] Lucas.
Thanks for taking care of Mom.
We took care of each other.
[Lucas] Dad? [Henry] Yeah.
[Lucas] There's something I didn't tell Mom.
And I really need her to know.
I have a family, too.
I've been saving my strength
because I want to see them
one more time.
Oh. Do you have to?
We don't want you to feel any pain.
I'm afraid to go to sleep. Shh. You're in good hands.
Shh. You're in good hands.
Close your eyes and think of something nice.
Think of something nice.
[Henry] Lucas! [Lucas] Dad!
Mom's okay, Lucas.
We're going home.
[Henry] Be careful. You okay?
[Tudpole] Mr. Bennett! Mr. Bennett!
I'm Oliver Tudpole from Zurich Insurance. They sent me to take care of your family.
You have nothing to worry about now.
In a few hours, you'll be at Singapore General Hospital,
where your wife will receive the best treatment in all of Asia.
These people will take you onto the plane. I'll see you once you're there.
Have a safe flight.
[Maria] Where are we going?
They'll take us to Singapore. You'll be safe there, okay?
Oh, please take your seat. We'll be taking off shortly.
Okay.
-Can I just... -Yeah. Okay. One minute.
How are you?
Here. With you.
Mom.
Guess what?
I saw Daniel again.
He was so happy.
He was in somebody's arms.
I bet it was his dad, Mom.
I love you.
[sobbing] Lucas, I love you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.
[nurse] I'm sorry, but you have to go back to your seat now.
Fasten your seatbelts, please.
I don't want to. [Henry] Why not? You have to do your seatbelts up in a plane.
