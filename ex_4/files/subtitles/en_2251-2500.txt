Hello, Villon! Where are you?
I'm on my way.
You already left. Where are you?
I said I'm on my way!
Just tell me where the spare key is so I can empty it.
No, the keys are with me.
How many times do I have to say that I don't have a spare?
Are the jerks on their way there?
Are you nuts? The rat squad is on its way!
So hurry up!
Okay, okay!
Make sure no one touches my things.
Make sure no one touches my things. Someone's calling.
Okay, okay. Hurry up!
Hello?
Brother, where are you now?
I'm almost there. I'm on my way.
I'm almost there.
Is that so?
Okay. Is Auntie coming?
No, she can't walk properly.
Okay, how about Mom's dress?
It's with me.
That's good. Mom might haunt us if she's not wearing that dress.
How's Yanni?
Yanni is at the chapel.
Uncle and his family already left.
They couldn't wait for you. They won't come back tomorrow.
Mom's siblings are so…
Okay, okay.
Okay, bye.
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
Hello.
-Hello, Papa. Where are you? -Baby?
I told you I'm on my way there.
I'm on the way.
Did you buy the toy you promised me?
I have it with me.
I'm on my way.
-Okay, Papa- -Okay, baby. I have to go. Bye.
Fuck!
Fuck, shit!
Fuck.
Please move ahead.
Please sir.
Good evening, sir.
Good evening.
Checkpoint, sir.
I'm Detective Edmund Villon.
Oh!
What happened?
Only a checkpoint.
Looks like you're busy.
Just doing some overtime, sir.
Okay, I'll go ahead. Thank you.
We're not done here.
Wait.
You've been drinking.
I can smell you.
What?
You smell like booze!
You should know what to do.
Just let it go.
That's a violation.
That's in RA1056, section 6.
You can be detained, sir.
What's fucking section 6 again?
Sir, it's simple.
There's a liquor ban, you're driving under the influence. Give me your license.
Bro…
Just give it.
The truth is there's been a death in the family.
I'm just going through a hard time.
Can you please just let it go?
I'm not driving far.
Condolences, sir.
-Thank you. -Give me your license.
I still need your license.
Bro, I'm sorry.
Actually, my mother died.
I'm just going through a tough time.
-It's the last night of the wake. -It's not allowed.
-Let it go. -Just give it.
-Just give me your license, sir. -I just drank a little.
It's not a big deal.
It's simple, just give me your license, sir.
Please bro, let me go this time.
Wait, sir. Just stay there.
Hey! I told you to stay, dumbass!
Watch him!
Yes sir.
Sir!
What?
This arrogant jerk won't cooperate.
-Sir! -What's the problem?
Good evening, sir.
I'm Detective Edmund Villon.
Sorry, I just drank a bit.
I'm just going through something.
Tomorrow is my mother's burial.
Please do me a favor and let this go.
Sir, he tried to escape.
-No! -He was about to back up.
Why would I run? I'm here asking nicely, sir.
I'm just having a tough time. Please help me out here. Okay?
I'm also a cop. We're all cops here.
-You're a cop? Where? -Show us your ID.
Or your badge. Where is it?
Give them to us.
I'm from the PNP Intel Division.
From which precinct?
We can call them up.
Give me the number.
And the local number too.
So? You're stalling.
4-4-4-
Wait, wait!
Slow down.
4-4-4
1-0-1-1
local 1308, got it?
-This is right? -Why would it be wrong?
Verify it.
-Go ahead, call. -Do you have prepaid minutes?
Of course!
-Sir-- -Verify it.
Can you give me a free pass?
I'm asking for a favor here.
-Okay, just wait a minute. -My destination is not far from here.
Sir! I know why he's in a hurry.
-He was probably involved in a crash. -Hey, don't touch my car!
-Take a look at this. -Don't touch that!
This bastard.
Look at this fucker.
Hey!
-Stop! -Hold him!
You're fighting back?
Get up!
Sir, they confirmed it.
What?
He's a PNP Intel officer.
What's his name?
Edmund Villon.
We're all cops here. Show some respect.
Why is this locked?
Do you have the keys?
Locked?
Whose desk is this?
It's Villon's.
Where is he?
At his mother's wake.
Get me something to open this, right now!
Sir, I have a hammer. Wait, I'll get it.
What's inside?
He just said not to open it.
What?
You know how he is.
He's different when he's mad.
Son of a bitch.
Here it is, sir.
Open it.
Hey, Mr. Kickboxer.
Bitch.
Fuck.
You broke my tooth, you idiots! Take a look!
Look!
What if I knock out your tooth?
Sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
Just sorry?
This is my favorite.
What's up, bro?
Mr. Hit-and-Run?
You'll throw me in jail during my mom's wake?
What's my name?
No, what's your name?
You bastard.
Sir, sorry. But next time you drink, please don't drive.
You should've verified his info faster.
-As if you stood up to him earlier. -Shut up.
You know I was just doing my job.
Hey! You bastards!
Motherfuckers!
Especially you!
This is a lot of money!
So many bunches.
You guys are too much.
You can't escape from this.
What's all this ruckus?
Chief.
Why are you here this late at night?
Detective Villon's mother has not been buried.
And now you're accusing him when he's not here to defend himself.
What the hell?
Are you even humans?
We're just following orders.
Leave now. Come back after the funeral.
Didn't you hear me? Get out!
Everyone who receives bribes are listed here.
Bribes from all kinds of businesses.
I said get out.
Elton Dizon - 50,000
Elmer de Asis - 200,000
Arturo Gopez - 200,000
Edmund Villon - 200,000
And more than half a million…
Chief, you're truly on a different level.
CALL ME NOW!
INTERNAL AFFAIRS RAIDED US!
VILLON, WHERE ARE YOU?
Fuck.
Shit!
Fuck!
Hello.
Where are you?
What? Wait! Can you give me a break here!
We already need Mother's clothes.
Okay, okay, okay.
-Bro! -I said yes already!
Shit! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck!
Brother.
Where's Erica?
She's waiting at the morgue.
Bring this to her so she can dress Mom.
Mama!
Mama!
Papa, what took you so long?
I had to go far to get your grandmother's dress.
Where's the toy you promised me?
Next time, baby.
When I have time.
You always say that, Papa.
Baby, please understand our situation now.
I'll make time.
I'll buy it. I promise, baby.
Okay?
This is a big problem.
Chief, can we please finish this after the funeral?
Hey Villon, you need to take responsibility for this.
Wait, wait.
Are you asking me to take the fall?
And you're asking me at my mom's wake? Wow!
Bro, please bear with us.
But we can't all go down just because of your list.
Take responsibility. I'll take care of you.
You? You're the one who wants me to take the fall!
All of you are on that list! Especially you!
All of your bar exploits are listed there!
-You listed those? -Miss Lumaylay, right?
-Three times a month, mostly yours- -Brother.
Not once, but thrice a month!
Mom is ready.
Villon, this is all just wrong timing. I'm sorry.
You have our condolences.
Sir, condolences.
Bro, condolences.
We'll go ahead.
Bro, sorry.
Internal Affairs ransacked our office.
I couldn't even find an envelope.
This is all I could give you.
Condolences.
Get this done already.
Fix her makeup.
It's good you were able to bring a proper dress.
-Yeah. -Yes, our brother brought it in time.
Are you going to leave the jewelry on her?
I'll let our brother decide.
Okay. Don't worry, we'll fix her up nicely.
IA MIGHT GO THERE. CLEAN UP YOUR CAR.
Who will stay for the night?
We'll talk about it later.
Chief, let's find dirt on the guys from Internal Affairs.
We need leverage against them.
If you can find some. They're not called IA for nothing!
They're still just cops. Don't put them on a pedestal, sir.
Don't overestimate them.
Wait, isn't that Villon?
Why does he have balloons?
What's this guy doing?
Okay, close the casket.
Sir.
Can I talk to you for a bit?
Of course.
I want to be with my mother for the last time.
-For you, sir. -Wait, you don't have to give me this.
A token of gratitude.
Okay,
if you insist.
Thank you.
You can stay only until midnight.
We need to move your mother to the chapel.
Okay.
-What are the balloons for? -For my daughter.
Mom, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God!
Why are you there? Go to your station.
I'm sorry, sir.
Mama! Mama!
Mama! Mama!
I'm really sorry, Mom.
It sounded scary!
-Come with me. -Really?
You've here for so long and you're still scared?
I heard something.
Mama!
Pick up, Central.
This is Central, copy.
Central, please check if someone's in Room B-20.
Negative. I can't see anything. You need to go inside.
Please bring the keys down.
Who will man my post?
You come and get them.
You're so lazy, man.
Okay, I'll come up.
Hey, don't leave me!
Son of a--
Wait, stay there. Catch!
What happened?
Sir, Ma'am heard noises in Room B-20.
Sir, I heard noises, like echoes.
What echoes? I know someone's inside.
What were you thinking?
No need for keys, it's not locked.
Someone's inside.
You may go.
Did you move it?
Oh, I rotated it earlier.
It's almost midnight. She needs to be moved, right?
-Yes, I'll call my men. -Okay. Someone might still visit.
I almost forgot.
All right.
We'll go home first, brother.
Please take care of her.
Bring me some clothes for the funeral tomorrow.
Okay.
What?
No, Father.
No.
-It's heavy. -So heavy, isn't it?
Be a good girl. Okay.
Thank you, Father, for the service.
-Condolences. -Thank you.
If you need me, I'm always here for your family.
He really loves your Mom.
Internal Affairs already backed out.
They confiscated all the money, so now we're even.
We did everything we could to clear your name.
See? We made it work somehow.
You just don't trust us.
Thank you, Chief. I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay. Take care.
Shit.
Boss, it looks like you're drunk.
Here.
Sir.
What the-- who told you to park there on the corner?
Sorry, sir.
Don't just say sorry! Fix this!
-You'll cause an accident! -I'll remove it.
So stupid.
What do we do? Chief will kill us!
We recently confiscated this homemade C-4 in a raid.
It's small.
But it's strong and has a wide blast range.
And most of all, it can be detonated from afar.
They're so desperate to look good
in front of the new National Police Chief.
Once this button is pressed,
the bomb will explode in two minutes.
Now, let's begin the demonstration.
We will blow up the symbols of the different types of corruption.
They will now install the cage, so we will be safe.
Don't worry, the cage is blast-proof.
And we only used a small amount of C-4.
Okay.
Ready.
Armed.
Hey, Villon's here.
How was the funeral?
It was okay, sir.
Man, it must be hard on you.
Of course. Plus, you wanted me to take the fall, so it became harder.
That's enough.
Don't be sarcastic, Villon.
Arturo was the one who found a way to fix everything.
See? You should be thanking me.
One round is on you.
Okay, all right.
Nice!
We need to be careful. IA might still be watching us.
Relax.
It's going to explode.
That's nothing.
That was intense.
We're dead meat.
Chief.
What's up, man?
Why is this not working?
Cold cases
and those near their statute of limitations. Fuck!
They were just assigned to us.
We're too old for this shit!
Why did they give these to us?
Probably, our punishment.
Elton, get some AR's from the armory.
Boys, let's move. We got a tip.
Here, let's go.
Abet Hogar a.k.a. "Apyong."
You're the target now.
Hey Villon, let's go!
Abet Hogar a.k.a. "Apyong."
Here, take a good look at him.
He's fronting as the owner of a high-end bar for the rich.
He's been reported before.
He killed some of his competitors.
His bar houses his drug operation.
So if we catch this lowlife, maybe
we can also get the entire organization.
We won't only redeem ourselves.
We might even get promoted.
Nice, a promotion.
This is your chance, Villon.
-Good afternoon, sir. -Good afternoon.
We have a search warrant
for Abet Hogar a.k.a. "Apyong."
Open the gate.
Let's go, sir.
Are there other people renting here?
No one rents here anymore, sir.
It was abandoned 10 years ago.
Sir Apyong is our only tenant, sir.
Why does the bad guy always hide in a warehouse?
-This way, sir. -Where?
Here, sir.
Sir, this is Mr. Apyong's office.
Do you have the keys?
No, sir.
Open it.
Wait. That's not allowed.
It's fine, I'll take responsibility.
There's nothing there.
I thought we'll hit the jackpot.
Sir, positive. This is Apyong's unit.
But it's negative on drugs.
So, what are we going to do now?
Search the place. We need to find evidence.
Okay, let's go.
-Where's the restroom? -That way, sir.
You come with me.
Bro!
What's up, bro?
Sir!
Someone reported a car accident here.
When?
The other day.
Are there casualties?
According to the report, the victim was loaded in the trunk.
Who tipped you off?
Anonymous, sir.
He hung up before we could trace the call.
Villon, did you find anything?
-Hey! -Sir!
It's you.
Chief, you remember Lt. Franco?
He helped us with Internal Affairs.
He's a subordinate.
-Is that so? -Sir.
This is Mark.
What brings you here?
Hit and run, sir.
The suspect drove off with the victim in his car.
Is that so?
It's not a hit-and-run, but a hit-and-take-home.
Do you have a lead?
Not yet, sir.
Actually, I still need to check the CCTV footage.
This way, sir.
There.
We also need to check it out.
We might also find a lead to Apyong.
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.
Okay, go with him.
Sir, I'll go, too.
No need, Arturo can go alone.
I'll go, since I don't have anything better to do.
All right.
Don't forget to feed Castro.
Then let's meet at the office.
-Yes, sir. -Okay.
Don't worry. Let's relax for now.
A lot of eyes are still on us.
Okay, just update me.
All right.
What did you do?
Did you find anything?
-Sir. -Yes.
Nice.
Anything new, bro?
The video has low resolution.
It's blurry and the accident happened at a blind spot.
It probably happened on this spot.
The video is too dark.
Right, it's too dark.
Do that later, let's eat first!
Let's eat!
Castro! Yummy, it's still hot.
Sir.
Hey, hold on.
Rewind it.
What?
Rewind it.
Play.
Go on.
Look, he's on the wrong lane, right?
See, he's on the wrong lane.
It means he avoided something.
Okay.
Then he swerved and got back on the right lane.
And then, bang! He hit something!
Where did you get the shards?
Show me.
Looks like it was hit here and landed there.
Right.
Forward it, look for the dog.
There, there.
Look at the dog.
So cute!
No, he seems to be watching.
It means something's happening there.
Go back to the car.
Check it out.
Stop.
Rewind it a bit.
It's a Vios, right?
It's a gray Vios, sir.
Gray or green?
-I think it's gray, sir. -Slate gray. Write it down.
Can you read the plate number?
I can't make out the letters.
But I can read the numbers.
Seven…
Six.
-Seven, six. -Seven, six. What's next?
Looks like eight?
Three?
What do you think?
I think it's three.
Three?
No, no. I think it's eight.
Three.
Eight.
That's a three.
That's an eight. Seven, six, eight.
Right? Okay.
Write it down.
I vote for eight.
What about the last number?
It's more blurred.
It's too dark, sir.
One?
Seven? One?
Looks more like one.
-It's fuzzy. -One or seven?
One?
Seven? One?
I think it's one, sir.
Too fuzzy, I give up.
Let's eat first.
Just one last number, sir.
Let's eat. Give up on that.
Because of the great amount of loss,
residents of the said barangay are seeking help,
even the parish priest of the said parish, Fr. Inocencio Santos
for financial assistance coming from the government.
Here, brother.
Your coffee.
It's hot.
Is the outing for Yanni's birthday still on?
Of course.
Okay.
Brother, I have a question.
Don't get mad.
It depends.
The shop tenant's contract is about to end.
Can I be the one to rent it?
I want to put up a pastry shop.
Let's wait for their contract to end first.
Maybe they want to renew their contract.
Just don't renew their contract.
You're a cop, right?
Hey, I'm a cop not a gangster.
What was that for?
Where will you get the capital?
From you, brother.
Please, brother. I don't want to be dependent on you forever.
Admit it, a pastry shop is a good idea.
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's wait if they'll renew the contract.
Okay.
I almost forgot.
Did Mom have a boyfriend?
What?
I went to a fortune teller.
She said, Mom has a man.
And she's with him until now.
It's really weird.
Everything she said was right.
My failed business, the flower shop.
And that you're separated from your wife.
She was only wrong about that.
Maybe Mom really has a man?
Mom had a lover?
Maybe?
So what?
PNP Intel, hello.
-Good afternoon. -Good afternoon.
I want to report a wanted man.
Okay, sir. Go ahead.
I have information about Apyong Hogar.
Who?
I just saw Apyong Hogar.
Sir, if this is a prank and you're just wasting our time,
don't call this line because
-I can sue you. -No, I'm telling the truth.
Understood?
Sir, I'm really--
PNP Intel.
Tell him to answer my call.
It's the one who just called.
What?
He wants to talk to you.
Okay, okay.
Sir, didn't I tell you to stop wasting my time?
I can easily file a case against you for this prank.
I just want to file a report.
I'm not doing anything wrong.
All right, what is it?
Like I said before, I saw Apyong Hogar.
Really now? Where did you see him?
That's what I wanted to ask you.
What did you say?
I said, that's what I wanted to ask you.
Bastard! Are you mocking me?
What I meant was, where did you take him?
What are you saying?
Is he in heaven or in hell?
Did you throw him in the ocean?
Or did you bury him?
You drive a gray Vios, right?
PNP Intel.
Please tell him to answer my call.
Villon, he said to answer his call.
-What? -On your cellphone.
Hello.
I know that you killed Apyong.
I think you're calling the wrong person.
I saw you run him over.
Can you sleep at night knowing you killed a man?
I don't understand.
-Who are you? -You already had your car fixed.
So what if I had my car fixed?
So what if I crashed and the insurance had it fixed?
Is that not allowed?
Can't say anything now?
Wow, you've also prepared your alibi!
Alibi? You're wasting my time, you fucker.
I'll end this call, so stop pestering me.
I'll just report that Apyong's body is at the cemetery.
I hope you buried him deep in the ground.
That didn't happen, bro.
What are you saying?
What the hell are you saying?
Okay, end the call. I'll really report you.
You're really the one who killed him, right?
Who are you, motherfucker?
What do you need from me, bastard?
Swear one more time and I'll go straight to the police.
You're not in the position to be arrogant, Villon.
I won't tell you what I want for now.
And don't ever look for me.
Because if I get mad, everyone will know what you did.
You look fine.
You don't look guilty at all.
I applaud your fighting spirit.
Crazy!
What the fuck? This guy's crazy!
This bastard, hey!
CAN YOU CATCH UP???
Where are you going?
Fuck!
Villon.
You're having a nightmare.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
And you're just here.
Get out.
The cemetery where your mom is buried is really big.
We explored it earlier.
Why were you there?
The signal of Apyong's cell phone was last traced near there.
It was turned off.
Cell phone?
Yes.
Your bumper is new, right? So smooth and shiny!
Had an accident?
-Yeah, I told you about it. -Right.
You weren't hurt?
-No. -Good.
You got a call.
See you at the office. Let's go.
How can a cop be so bad at a chase?
Did you think about it? Can we talk now?
I have a question.
How did you see me bury Apyong?
It was pitch dark.
It was dark, but it doesn't mean I couldn't see you.
Okay, go ahead.
Let's not get sidetracked here.
No.
You saw nothing.
You didn't see it.
You're just making it all up, motherfucker.
If you want to chase after me, if you want to investigate me,
go ahead. I don't care.
Because you don't really know where Apyong is! You son of a bitch!
You didn't see me bury Apyong, asshole!
Bastard! You don't have proof!
Villon, your phone is ringing. Answer it.
Are you hiding from someone?
No.
He called again?
You've been getting calls all day.
It's just a prank caller with nothing to do.
You motherfucking asshole! Asshole!
-Motherfucker! -Why are you hurting him?
Do you want me to expose you?
-What's the problem? -Boss, calm down.
Why are you attacking a member of our squad?
-Your squad? -Yes.
He's a cop?
Man, sorry, sorry.
I'm sorry. You just look like the man who conned me.
Sorry, sorry. I'm really sorry.
Bro, I'm sorry.
Chief, this is Lt. Franco.
He's the one who helped us with the IA investigation.
Thank you so much.
He's our savior! We owe him big time!
He's our hero.
Sir.
Thank you, sir.
-Elmer De Asis. -Sir.
-Elton Dizon. -Sir.
And the one you beat up, Det. Edmund Villon.
Really?
-He's Villon? -Yeah.
He's popular for being a sharp cop.
I'm sorry again. I mistook you for someone else.
Pretty Boy Villon, sorry.
Sorry, man.
Fuck man, sorry. I got it wrong.
Sorry, boss. I'm really sorry, Chief.
-Thank you, again. -Sorry.
Take care.
Are you okay?
He said sorry. Now, let's eat.
Let's go.
Franco.
There are two types of animals in this world, Villon.
One who hides his tail in front of an Alpha.
While the second type,
always retaliates no matter what.
Which one are you, Villon?
-So you're a cop. -So what?
Are you scared because I'm a cop?
What do you want?
That's the best question you've asked me all day, Villon.
Give me Apyong's body.
How can I do that?
I really don't know where he is.
Boss, boss, wait!
Wait, wait!
It hurts!
Boss, wait! Wait!
Bro, enough. It hurts. Bro.
Stop it, man.
Don't beat up a cop.
That was painful!
I wonder how much pain Apyong felt?
Stop it, man.
You're nothing.
Bring Apyong to me by tonight.
You fucker.
Sorry. I'm sorry, Mom.
Sorry, Mom.
Son of a bitch.
Shit!
What do you want to tell me, fucker?
Hello, Apyong.
Where are you, man?
I can't reach you.
I have a gig later.
You're hard to come by lately.
Hey, Apyong!
What's wrong?
Apyong!
Who's this?
Hello, bro. Please triangulate the cell phone number I sent you.
-What? -And send me a mug shot.
Right now?
Yes, right now.
Okay, sure, sure.
When you've traced the signal, I need you to send me the address.
What? That's not allowed. You need a warrant for that.
-What? -A warrant is needed.
There's no need for a fucking warrant.
Don't worry, bro. It's on me. I'll take the heat.
-Come on! -Okay, sure.
Okay.
Hey, bro.
Where's Villon?
Beats me.
Where has he been going?
A letter from traffic.
Overspeeding…
North Luzon Expressway
N-A-C,…
7-6-…
8-7…
Sir, inspection please.
And the entrance fee.
-How much? -500.
It's 500.
Thank you.
Come again, sir?
One beer, please.
Here, sir.
Thank you.
Hey, get some drinks. It's on me.
Thanks, bro.
-Hi, Babe! -Give me my shirt.
Kiss later, I'm drenched in sweat.
-We played well? -Yes.
-You almost made a mistake earlier. -Yeah, sorry.
Good thing you recovered.
-Be more careful on our next set. -Sure.
-Wait, I'm still getting dressed. -You're so sweaty.
Of course, I performed.
Cheers!
Hey, wait for me. Hey!
The next band is also good.
I missed you.
Yeah, louder!
Let's get crazy tonight!
You were great earlier.
-Let's make a toast. -Later.
Give me a minute, my bag… I'll come back.
-Where are you going? -I'll just get something.
Fuck!
-What do you need from me? -You ran away.
Hey, it hurts! Asshole!
Come with me.
What now?
Mommy!
What?
Go ahead!
-Having fun? -Boss, let me go!
Now, you call me "boss."
Put your foot out.
-Boss, this is too high! -Put your foot out!
-Please. -I'll shoot you.
Make me do something else.
Bitch! Your foot!
-I can't-- -Down.
Boss, this shit is high!
Son of a bitch, this is high!
Mommy!
Please let me go! I don't know anything!
-I'll really let you go! -Boss, don't!
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!
Are you ready to talk?
-Boss, please don't. Fuck! -What now?
I've just been waiting for you.
-I don't know! -Don't know?
Why is Franco looking for Apyong?
Boss, boss! Mommy, Mommy!
You really won't talk?
Then, I'll just drop you! What now? What?
-I'll talk! -What?
Apyong stole Franco's key!
What key?
-Please let me go now. -What key?
To the safe!
What's inside the safe?
Boss, I'm begging you…
-What's inside the safe? -Fuck!
Drugs!
Drugs!
The safe contains fucking drugs!
Franco is a big-time drug lord.
It started when he was assigned to head drug raids.
They confiscated a lot of drugs from dealers.
Police officials like him.
They thought he reported all confiscated drugs before disposing of them.
They thought he's straight. They trusted him.
They didn't know he is stealing drugs.
He found a way to process drugs dissolved in water.
He has his own drug lab with Apyong.
They were able to create a unique formula from those drugs.
Plus, it's even more potent.
They mix it in alcohol and they sell it exclusively in Franco's bars.
He deals with a lot of businessmen, drug lords and syndicates.
They all love Franco's concoction. The high is one of a kind.
It's expensive but they clamor for it.
That's why they got rich off of his formula.
Millions, maybe billions. You will never know.
Maybe that's why Apyong betrayed him, he got greedy.
He didn't know that Franco is truly a demon.
He'd look for him no matter the cost because he stole the key to his safe.
Franco killed a lot of men looking for Apyong.
He shows no mercy and kills everyone.
Of course, all his money is in that safe.
Franco will do anything to find Apyong.
Apyong will keep the key in his body.
I know him. Everything important is inside his body.
Fuck, man.
Son of a bitch! Shit!
Villon!
Stay there. Don't move.
-Bro, relax. -Don't move!
Relax. Please, please!
-Drop it! Drop it! -Okay, okay.
There.
Bro, relax. Please.
-What the hell are you doing? -I didn't do this, bro.
So what's that?
I didn't kill him. Please believe me.
Fuck, he was already dead!
-He was fucking shot! -Look!
Take a look.
Your car was already wrecked before you crashed into the patrol car.
Am I still wrong?
Okay, okay, okay…
I can explain, man. Lower your gun first.
Fuck, man. Wait, bro!
Fuck, man! God damn it!
What the fucking hell!
Fuck, man.
I know we're no model cops, but we're not killers.
How did you end up like this?
Just turn me in…
I'll confess everything.
I'll talk. I'm just so tired. I want to rest.
Rest?
How can you think of resting now?
Well, at this rate, you might be resting for most of your life.
You'll be facing manslaughter…
Disposal of body…
Didn't you think of your daughter?
You drive me crazy.
You're crazy.
Fuck it.
Do what you must. It's your life.
Here.
Do you think I'll sleep better if I lock you up?
Bro…
Your mom just…
Your mom just died and then this?
Bro…
-Bro… -No need to thank me. It's okay.
Bro, please help me.
I'm helping you right now.
Not this, bro.
A cop is blackmailing me.
-That's this nonsense? -It's true. He's a cop.
That guy, Apyong, I accidentally ran him over.
Lt. Franco, that fucker…
I really think he's the one who killed him.
Believe me, man.
I'm sure he's the killer.
Who's that?
Pretty boy,
are you with Arturo?
Get out of the car. This is important.
Are you watching us?
Get out if you don't want Arturo to get involved in this.
What's wrong?
Well, well.
Look who's ordering me around?
Listen, bro, where the hell are you?
Don't ask, just cross the road.
You want Apyong, right?
No, you come here. I'll wait for you.
No, this place is big. I'll wait right here.
Right now. I'll be waiting.
I have places to be.
-What? Come! -There. Just stay there.
Where are you?
Hello?
Hello?
-Okay, go! -Are you there? Hello!
So, how's the aim?
The operator is good, right?
Now, let's stop this nonsense.
Just get Apyong and bring him to me at 6 a.m.
You bastard. Why'd you have to drag him into this?
Fuck, I told you I'd give him to you, right-
Hey, hey, are you crying?
I'll rat you out, you motherfucker!
I didn't know you're so emotional.
Let's go to jail together, you motherfucker!
Villon, just focus on the work at hand.
Coming.
-Who are you? -I'm Lt. Franco, we spoke earlier.
But my brother is not here.
I'm talking to him right now.
Hello, Villon.
I'm here at your condo.
-Come in. -I'm coming in.
I'll come in and wait for you.
I'm inside. Thank you.
Hey!
I'm in your house.
-Don't touch my family, you bastard! -Hi, Jeff!
-Fucking Bitch! -I met Jeff.
You must be Villon's daughter.
-No, no, no, no! -What's your name?
Yanni, sir.
Oh, it's Yanni.
-Yanni, Yanni! -Your daughter draws well, man.
Don't fucking hurt her, you son of a bitch!
Brother?
What's wrong?
Where is he?
-Brother, what happened? -Who?
-Brother, wait. -What's happening?
Brother? Brother!
What's wrong?
-Where is he? -Who?
-Where the fuck is he? -Brother, what are you doing?
-Lower your gun, brother. -Where is he?
Brother, please calm down. What's wrong?
Where's Yanni? Yanni!
She's in the room.
-Brother. -Where is he?
What happened?
-Where did he go? -Who?
He already left.
-The guy who went here? -Yes, the lieutenant.
Your friend. I let him in because he said he'll wait for you.
Fuck! What did he say?
-He said he'll come back. -Why did you let him in?
He said he'll come back.
-Why'd you have to let him in? -I don't know.
Brother.
SO? CAN YOU STILL TAKE IT? BRING APYONG TO THIS LOCATION.
Erika.
As soon as Yanni wakes up tomorrow, get out of the house.
Get away from Manila.
-What? -Go to bank and get some cash.
Then text me where you're going so I can follow. Understood?
Okay, I will.
Are you all right, brother?
Tell me if you have a problem.
-I'm fine. -Are you sure?
Yeah.
Brother, did you fight with someone?
No.
Just do it.
Be careful, brother.
Sir, here's the live ammo you requested.
Sign here, sir.
Right here.
Where? It's all filled out.
Wait, sir. I'll get a new sheet.
You motherfucker.
Let's see if you can take this.
Okay, slow down.
Stop.
Bring Apyong now.
Stop, don't move.
What's this?
Move.
Hey! It's still here!
Like I thought, it's still here.
He's been shot several times.
You shot him, right?
Yes, I shot him.
Then, boom! You ran him over.
So, which one of us killed him?
Is it still important now, Villon?
Are we done?
You want a receipt?
Villon.
Fuck!
I thought we were done, man?
Fuck! Then go right ahead and shoot me.
If you kill me now, you'll be dead tomorrow.
I've been a cop for 10 years, man.
Would I come here without an insurance?
I made a report of all your crimes.
Everything you've done!
All the details of your drug deals, bar operation…
And what you did to Apyong and Arturo. Everything.
So go ahead, shoot me.
Because for sure, you'll be in jail tomorrow.
Shoot me now.
-That's it? -Go ahead. What now?
Shit, bro.
Go on, shoot me.
Shoot me.
Go on, shoot me!
If you're not gonna use it man, then keep it!
Kill me!
I can still use you, Villon.
We're in this together.
Why not just join me?
You're my accomplice, anyway.
Join the big league.
Leave the small-time cons to your colleagues.
Do it for Yanni.
Hey, shoot me! Shoot me!
Go on, shoot! Shoot me!
If you're not gonna shoot me, then put away your gun!
Fuck! Man, you're good!
I'm your fan, pretty boy!
You impressed me there, man!
So?
Think about what I said, Villon. Okay?
-So, did you think about it? -Yeah.
-Let's talk about it, Villon. -Okay.
You'll fit right in, man!
Your skills.
Your spunk and strength.
-You have it in you! -Yeah.
Plus, your acting ability fucking floored me!
-Okay, man? -Yeah, okay.
-Yes? -Okay, okay, yes.
-Yeah! Rock 'n roll! -Okay, bye.
Rock 'n roll!
-Hello, Erica? -Hello, Brother.
What time will you come here?
I'm about to leave now.
I'll pass by the station first, then I'll go straight there.
How's Yanni? Is she having fun?
Yeah, she's having a blast.
Wait, I'll call her.
Yanni, your dad called.
The station first, then here.
-Hello, Papa. -Hello, baby.
Happy Birthday.
Papa, what time are you coming here?
I'm about to leave now.
-See you soon. -Okay.
Hurry up.
Love you.
Love you, baby.
Good, you're still here.
I caught up to you.
Thank God.
Were you surprised?
I was surprised, too.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here!
Throwing stuff now?
Still fighting back?
You're nothing.
So?
You motherfucker.
Just wait and see, you filthy animal.
You think you're the boss?
Fuck you.
You can't win over me, idiot!
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
You think you can take me on?
-You can't handle me, idiot. -Come at me!
You want me?
Fuck you!
Motherfucker.
You think you can take me on?
Fuck you.
What now?
-Fuck you. -What?
What?
Wow! Heavy!
You're still up?
Hey!
You think I'll leave you alive? Think again, fucker.
Idiot.
What now?
So?
Hey! Still alive?
Still fighting!
I see, It's not game over yet!
Come here. Come here.
Let's see what you got.
Come out!
You want to play?
Villon!
You want more, Villon?
Villon!
Villon!
Villon!
You can't escape from me.
Fuck you, Villon!
Let me go, Villon! Villon!
Get back here or else… You'll have a taste of-- Let me go!
Can you still dance?
You won't get out of there. Just stay there!
You're done for!
That's mine!
That's mine!
That's mine!
That's mine!
Son of a bitch!
You stink!
Fuck you!
Robbery,
extortion,
drugs,
homicide,
hit-and-run.
and covering up the evidence.
The worst.
Rotten.
Rotten to the core.
This will bury us all.
Especially when news comes out.
This should never get out.
Why did this happen,
when the new PNP Chief just took office?
This is so humiliating.
Truly humiliating.
I understand how you feel.
But life is just like that, Villon.
A year passes so fast.
Relax.
After you're done thinking,
go back to being a cop.
You did well
in giving your separation pay to Arturo's mother.
That's a big help to them.
But what other job can you do aside from being a cop?
Who knows? There are many jobs out there.
I'll find something to do.
Just think about it, Villon.
I'll delay the approval of your resignation.
It's okay.
Thank you, Chief.
Can you do it?
You guys be careful.
You've been playing for a long time.
Brother, what do you want to eat? Healthy or not?
This one's mine.
She's fine.
-She's almost riding it. -She can do it.
-Brother. -Yeah?
What do you plan to do now that you're no longer a cop?
Well, I plan to buy a secondhand food truck.
-Why a food truck? -Let's buy a food truck first.
Once we've saved up enough, we can open up a pastry shop.
-That can work. -Yes!
-You're sure? Promise? -Yeah, I'm sure.
Then, I can talk to Chief.
Believe me, this is a good idea.
A lot of people there.
Do you remember the place I used to frequent outside?
-The food's delicious. -Yes, the one near the fishball stall.
That's a busy area.
-There's a store there, right? -Yeah.
That spot is what I'll ask for.
-Okay, that's a good spot. -Yeah, the one on the right.
Hope it goes well.
Yeah and I already spoke with the seller of the truck.
What did he say?
He said okay…
Fifty percent down.
Fifty percent is big.
Do you want some more?
What do you want?
-Yes, sir? -Private Piggy Bank?
This way, sir.
Boss, a client's here.
Hey, man.
The key?
Boss.
-Will you withdraw? -Yes.
How much?
Everything.
-Everything? -Yeah.
Okay.
-Go with him. -Yes, boss.
This way, sir.
Honey.
I don’t want Kiddo in our bed.
Don’t you dare call Gustaw Kiddo.
-Where were you? -Nowhere.
Why did you wake him up? He has a mating date this week.
Sleeping helps his libido.
Be careful.
Listen… Are we going fishing?
Nope. Just reeling people in.
I don’t get it.
Don’t worry. Neither does my boss.
Wow!
One more ad and we’re done.
This dressing up is killing me.
I’ll pay my dad’s debt and I’m out. Hey!
I’m sick of this.
-What? -This! -All of it. -It looks great.
-All of it. -It looks great. What? My naked butt?
Monika, I keep telling you, this naked butt has a heart, brain,
Monika, I keep telling you, this naked butt has a heart, brain, feelings and dreams.
And it’s very photogenic.
The world would be a better place if all guys thought that.
-You know I’m one of a kind. -You sure are.
Ms. Monika!
Good, you’re finally here.
I let them in. The headmaster was snooping around.
You’re it!
But I won’t cover for you any longer.
-Thanks. -One more thing.
Since I was already here, I aired the room.
Class! It's time to begin.
Let me go! -Oh sweet Jesus. Stasiu! -Ms. Monika!
-Oh sweet Jesus. Stasiu! -Ms. Monika!
Good morning, Mr. Headmaster, sir!
The kids’ place is at their desks, and the teacher’s at the blackboard.
-New teaching methods-- -...have to work.
The results of national exams will verify whether or not your approach is effective.
If it's not… Well, you know what will happen.
Defilad Square. All right?
It’s not safe to get into a stranger's car.
This car is extremely safe.
It has traction control system, blind spot detection,
and it warns you when you drive off the road.
Why is it beeping? I fastened my seat belt.
It knows when the driver is distracted and sets him straight.
You are joking.
About work?
Never.
-Do you sell cars? -Not at all.
I just enjoy them.
You must be very busy.
Not right now. Are you?
Not at all.
What a coincidence! This calls for a celebration.
Alicja! You look stunning.
Here is our dumbest writer.
What did I write? And why was it dumb?
You wrote that Global Technic’s new technology is 20 years old.
Because it is.
The newest technology is new. That’s it.
Delete the post.
I’m not going to lie to our readers.
I’m an engineer, not a trained monkey.
Even monkeys understand basic marketing.
Szymon, explain it to Stefan. I don’t have the energy to do it.
It’s simple, really.
If we don’t make a profit, we get shut down.
We make a profit through ad sales. Thank you.
That is why we are making a video
with the ad agency, and you’re in it.
Doing what?
Just showing your face.
You’ll have a great car, great views, and a great girl.
You will make some of your famous faces and that’s it.
Let’s see that great car.
And the views. Excuse me.
Hi, honey…
Why do we work with him?
Enzo is a big star.
Ferrari’s name was Enzo. He’s a simple Stefan Tkaczyk.
Wow! I mean, wow! This uniform really suits you.
I mean, wow! This uniform really suits you.
Oh, come on. Can’t you see I’m fat?
Can’t you see I’m fat?
You? Fat? Just heavily stunning.
The magazines you wanted.
Thanks.
-Bloody celebrity. -I heard you!
After my shows, your sales are soaring.
And the car is clean. You know it’s not your car.
You drive it around, praise it on TV and give it back unharmed.
It’s just lipstick.
Women put it on to look pretty.
-Excuse me! -Coming!
Yes?
-Can you help me open my car? -With pleasure.
New toys.
Powerful, right?
Mom wouldn’t let that happen.
Why didn’t I buy lilies of the valley? She loved those.
They only bloom once a year.
-I’m talking about the debt. -They were in bloom then.
He hit us! He ran a red light! It wasn’t your fault.
Why didn’t I remember about them when she was still alive?
If you love someone, give them all the love you’ve got.
All of it.
All of it.
What if they don’t love me back?
That’s impossible.
Everyone loves you.
I’m serious, dad.
To be honest, I don’t know much about love.
But I know that when you meet that person,
when it all clicks into place,
everything is twice as good.
It happened with me and mom.
It will happen with you, too.
Real love is always squared.
Monika, it’s me again. Call me back.
Monika, it’s me again. Call me back. I’m about to have a heart attack.
-Where is he? -No idea, he’s not picking up.
He’ll come. Unless he’s coming somewhere else.
-That was mean. -It was.
Why don’t we start with Klaudia? Enzo is stuck in makeup.
She’ll come prepared. She got the brief.
-Such a hard worker, that one? -That’s her style.
I’ll be there.
No can do.
Hi!
-How much for a quickie? -Dammit. Get lost!
-I’m going to the palace. -Great.
-Hey! -Stop!
Cut-throat competition?
Comes with the job.
I’m not judging.
-Neither you, nor your colleagues. -My colleagues?
Jesus!
My colleagues?
You picked up the wrong girl.
Stop the car.
Finally!
-Hi! -Where were you?
I’ve been worried sick. Get dressed.
As usual, instead of scolding you, I’m glad you made it at all.
-Where is the new model? -It’s the gold one, by the car.
-That hooker? -That lech?
Just keep smiling.
You know her? Not one bit.
This is Klaudia.
-Do you know each other? -We don’t.
The car stops, they kiss.
Guys on stilts, colorful people, action...
Close-up on the logo, rain, and we're done.
-A kiss? -Wait.
Yeah!
-There was no kiss in the script! -There is now. The client changed his mind.
The client changed his mind. It’s in your contracts. Any problems?
It’s in your contracts. Any problems?
-One small one. -Right.
-One small one. -Right. -Thanks. -Klaudia, wait!
-Thanks. -Klaudia, wait!
Who forgot to tell the actors?
-I don’t know. -You don't know?
Must have been me. My bad.
Everyone! Let’s get started.
Now kiss and switch places.
Kiss, please.
Kiss her. Do it!
Very nice.
That’s enough. We got it.
Jesus!
Stop the car!
What was that?
What the hell!
Amateurs!
-You didn’t use the handbrake? -It’s an automatic car!
A bunch of amateurs!
-Come on, E… -Enzo!
-Calm down. -Did you see that?
No, I bloody didn’t.
Be quiet!
Everything fell apart.
I was so embarrassed, I wanted to disappear.
-I’m sure it wasn’t that bad. -It was exactly that bad.
Really? -And it’s his fault? -Who else’s?
-And it’s his fault? -Who else’s?
Mr. Big Star…
Maybe he was a star. In kindergarten.
When he played with toy cars.
-What’s this here? -Hush…
But Enzo has this…
This thing that works on TV.
Alicja!
I wish you were this quick at the set.
-That’s not fair! -What’s not fair?
-That’s not fair! -What’s not fair? You know what’s not fair?
This. What is this?
Car seat testing?
You agreed to an open relationship.
Not to you shagging everything that moves!
-Ala… -Stay away!
Get back. Reverse, now! It’s not like that.
-You know what, Stefan? -Enzo.
Don’t be ridiculous.
You ruined everything.
We lost the ads and…
BRO
-Who is it? -No one.
Now heads will roll.
I won’t fire myself.
You’re dumber than the dog!
-Don’t drag Kiddo into it. -Gustaw.
-Don’t drag Kiddo into it. -Gustaw. -I like him. -He hates you.
-I like him. -He hates you.
You know why he makes those weird, growling sounds?
He’s ready to attack.
His grandfather sat on a thief till the police came.
He’s a dangerous, wild creature.
You’re threatening me with Kiddo?
You know what? Pack your bags and geh zum Teufel, now!
You want me to sleep at the office?
Not really.
BRO
Stefan? Hi, Andrzej. How are you?
You won’t believe it. Are you asleep? No, go on. I’m up.
Kasia did it.
That’s very serious.
Do you want me to come over? We could talk then.
Your old lady kicked you the fuck out?
She’s not that old.
Couldn’t talk your way out of it?
Always deny everything.
Say it was your evil twin.
Good one. I’m going to my brother’s now.
She surprised me. Had corpus delicti.
Corpses are the worst.
Did she say why?
She said something about fulfilling her greatest dream.
I thought her dream was to be your wife and Ania's mom.
So did I! But clearly, I was mistaken.
Kasia went off for a cruise around the world
and left me with this.
She did always say it was her dream.
She saw an opportunity and did it alone.
Alone? She’s not alone!
Yachts are filled with men! Boatswain, skipper, sailors!
Men, plural. That’s not cheating.
Just a tiny summer break, or a small existential crisis.
Kasia told Ania she wanted to fulfill her dreams
and that she’ll come back a happy mom.
Be positive. She is coming back.
In the meantime, I’ll help you.
-What? -Sure.
-You hate kids. -People change every seven years.
My younger party brother changing to care for a little girl?
-I don’t buy it. -I can stay here, help out.
-You got kicked out. -No, I didn’t.
I did.
Kids need role models.
-So? -I’ll just hire a nanny.
A random stranger?
At least you know my faults.
Okay, I’m in.
One week. Starting tomorrow. You take over Kasia’s chores.
-Meaning? -Laundry, cleaning, swimming pool.
-And school. -What school?
Stefan. Ania started school three years ago.
Don’t bring anything. I still have food left.
I do.
Yes, sweetie, I remember. Eat a warm meal once a day.
Bye.
Wait! I’ve got the money.
No, wait! I’ve got the money!
My left, your right.
Good job, Kazik.
Next!
My right, your right.
Great!
My right…
-Kids! -What are you doing?
-Get off! -Let him go, I fell on my own.
What’s all that? Wild locusts!
Uncle?
-I’m not Santa, am I? -Where’s mom?
You don’t know?
-She left. -When will she be back?
Eventually, I guess. Hand.
Ania…
Sweetie.
It’ll be all right.
-Why did you do that? -What?
-Clearly you don’t have kids. -How do you know?
-Come on, Ania. Let’s go. -Go with your uncle.
What the hell is this?
-Stop the car! -Jesus!
What a mess.
I’m at your service.
-Why are you so tired? -Family life doesn’t suit me.
-You have a family life? -Regular lifestyle wears me off.
-You need to stay in shape. -Honey.
I’m always in shape.
-This is serious, Enzo. -Is it personal, too?
Don’t worry. I won’t ask you to marry me.
Good. Then go ahead.
The boss changed his mind. We’re doing the campaign.
-We are? -That’s right, we are.
You and our marketing department. That is me.
And with that model and her agency.
-What about the set catastrophe? -The set catastrophe...
You see, he saw the photos and the footage.
And he saw emotions. Emotionen, Enzo.
And that’s what he wants. So we got it!
Can I come back?
You can be a part of the campaign.
If it goes well, I’ll consider your comeback.
A private comeback?
Gustaw.
His muscles failed him when he was climbing his partner.
He walked it off, but he needs a massage, too.
The mate must stay in shape. Put those in a vase on your way out.
They’re offering good money.
-Hello, Ms. Monika. -I know.
-Hi! -So why won’t you take the job?
Half the city is covered with my ass.
I don’t want the other half to show me and that jerk.
My boss won’t like it.
You’ll find someone else.
I won’t, you’re too special. Think about it, all right?
Like most people, I have a family to support.
-Hi there! -Hello!
-Hi. -How are you?
Okay, I’m out. Think about it.
-Guys, be good. -Okay.
-Bye! -See you.
-Hey! -What?
-Watch it. -I’m working!
A short dress works every time. Klaudia is always right.
Here.
Is it not-short enough?
A pair of red heels and you’ll get your fourth baby.
It would be a girl.
Ania.
Our tiny little princess.
Speaking of. That jerk is the uncle of Ania, my best student.
That jerk is the uncle of Ania, my best student.
The idiot made her cry in front of the whole class!
Who’s the idiot?
Are you listening to me?
I’m talking about Enzo.
Enzo… You like that guy!
You’re crazy.
Boys, your mom went crazy.
Boys, your mom went crazy. -We need to get more ice-cream! -Yeah! Ice-cream!
-We need to get more ice-cream! -Yeah! Ice-cream!
Hi there. Good morning!
-Hi. -Hey.
Excuse me.
You don’t have to hide it from me.
-I really… -I won’t say a word.
For as long as I can.
It was nerve-wracking, so I gave it up.
Gave what up?
Two thugs came here looking for you.
Something about a debt.
People like them should not be coming here.
Of course.
Dad!
-Were you drinking? -Nah.
Mom was a saint for not killing you.
You should do it, sweetie.
Kill the old fool.
-Did you pay them back? -Sure.
I sure did. Half of it.
I sure did. Half of it. No, more than that!
That’s the good news.
What’s the bad news?
They considered it an interest. They want twice as much.
That’s more than I make in a year!
I know that.
Wiesiek’s friends?
-I’m calling the police. -Don’t!
He didn’t mean any harm.
He knew I needed the money.
Right. Did they give you a deadline?
One what? Day? Week?
One what? Day? Week? One month.
-And if you don’t pay? -Well…
They’ll take everything. And cut off my fingers.
Why the fingers?
Because I can’t count.
Don’t worry, I’ll find a way.
-Don’t you dare sell-- -You know I wouldn’t.
See you at mom’s.
Get your act together.
Hey. This is Klaudia. I’ll take the job.
This is Klaudia. I’ll take the job.
It’s the middle of the night! Can’t you call at some normal--
I’m here! Get me a cappuccino, hon.
I’m here. Hi, everyone
Sorry I’m late.
Nice of you to join us.
Go ahead, boss. What’s your idea for the campaign?
I need something fresh.
Something unique.
Your company is famous
for its fresh, innovative solutions.
Ms. Alicja will be the owner.
-Mr. Jacek will provide the content. -Sure.
Our star, Mr. Enzo... and the stunning Ms. Klaudia
and the stunning Ms. Klaudia
will be the faces of the campaign.
-In my opinion, it’s brilliant. -Sure.
We’re doing project management. You want synergy and competency.
-Entschuldigung. -Ja? Do you need all of us here?
-At this point of the campaign? -Exactly.
You are my driving idea
for the campaign.
Without Klaudia, this project management
is like a car on three wheels.
BRO: PICK UP ANIA AT 6:00 P.M.
Sorry for that.
Ms. Alicja, I hope you know what’s at stake here.
If the campaign fails, we’re done.
That’s it.
Hi, Stefan, how’s it going? Did Ania do her homework?
-She just finished. -Put her on the phone.
She’s in the bathroom. It might take a while.
What’s that noise? I don’t know. The hairdryer?
She’s drying her hair. I think.
-Is she okay? -I won’t go in there.
-It’s all good. -Are you sure?
It’s all good.
You sound weird.
Talk to you later!
Ania!
Your favorite uncle is back!
If you don’t come out, daddy will chop your favorite uncle into pieces.
Why are you yelling in the middle of the night?
We’re playing hide-and-seek.
-You’re clearly losing. -Do you know where she is?
What? Why would I care about a shoe?
I’m looking for Ania!
Oh, her.
Ania.
You know…
-She came by after school. -And?
We baked muffins. You know, the strawberry kind.
She’s a nice kid.
Took one home for her dad.
And one for her uncle.
-You know what? -What?
She misses her mom.
I know! But where is she?
You have a big mouth, don't you? You’re asking where she is?
Where did you go when you smashed your father’s car?
The garden plots? The football field!
Only it’s not a field now, it’s a parking lot.
Go on.
Get away from her! Right now!
Away!
Away, dammit!
What are you doing? Leave her alone!
Calm down, man. We’re feeding the dog.
What are you doing?
Feeding the dog. He’s waiting for his mom too.
Come on, Azor, let’s go. You’re lucky.
Come on, Azor, let’s go. You’re lucky. I always make time for my family. Unlike you.
I always make time for my family. Unlike you.
Stefan.
Come on.
-I found her, thank you. -There she is.
-Uncle? -Yes?
Do you know that guy?
Why did he call you Stefan, not Enzo?
Ania.
-Were you feeding Mr. Matysiak’s dog? -I was.
I was waiting for mom. She didn’t come back today.
That guy from the parking lot?
It was Przemek Matysiak? That geek from my class?
Fame has changed you.
You don’t recognize friends, forget about kids.
My kitten has gone off somewhere again.
-Trąbuś! -Goodnight.
Trąbuś!
CAMPAIGN???
-What? Is Ania missing? -Missing? Why?
-Seriously, how old are you? -Old enough.
She’s asleep. But she’s still sad.
She could pose for a painting. Girl. A Study In Despair.
She’s sad Kasia’s gone. What can we do?
There is one thing.
What if she got a letter from her mom?
-With a nice photo and tons of hearts? -Did she?
-Stefan… -It’s Enzo.
These can kill you.
I’ve been smoking for 40 years and I’m fine.
Now let's step aside...
Green light is on.
What do you do? Slowly!
Slow down, Staś. We’re crossing the street.
Slow down, Staś. We’re crossing the street. Very good.
Why the grin?
Kazik Malinowski said, "Did you see me run?" twice!
Kazik Malinowski said, "Did you see me run?" twice! You’re totally nuts.
He stopped stuttering!
If they botch the exams, she’ll be out the door.
It’ll prove those methods of her suck.
-Are you smoking that? -That green juice,
-Are you smoking that? -That green juice, the water and the running might be healthy,
but that’s not enough to calm my nerves at school.
I need a smoke.
Cheese!
-Monika Grabarczyk? -Stop yelling.
-The whole building can hear you. -You’re ashamed of your name?
My name is Hammer.
Nice to meet you.
But please keep it down.
There you go, Ms. Monika.
Mr. Stefan, your pass!
What? It’s GDPR 101.
Oops.
It’s the 13th floor. Take the other elevator.
Elevators are for wusses.
Why don’t you carry me up, tough guy? I broke a heel.
I know.
Running in heels should be an Olympic sport.
You have blue eyes.
Few brunettes do.
And you know lots.
It’s true, I like women.
But being a heartbreaker is not my full-time job.
-You can "like" baked potatoes. -I do, as well.
You know what I like most?
A girl who believes in love. I know I do.
And I don’t believe you.
We only have an hour left. We have to come up with something.
One hour seems promising. We’ve been here for 16.
Can’t we just do a regular car commercial?
A car is driving, horses are running, it’s raining,
clouds, hubcaps, done.
Eine moment. We’ve been through this.
Remember that the boss said the concept has to be based
Remember that the boss said the concept has to be based on the emotions of Enzo
and his partner.
You’re right. But I don’t know how to do that.
Neither do I.
I got it.
Four slogans, like four traffic signs.
Infatuation. Desire.
Infatuation. Desire. Jealousy.
Love.
Plus a final event... and bam, we got it.
and bam, we got it.
Food, anyone?
You can’t stack the pans inside like that.
Stefan?
Take care of it.
-Did you remember about the tickets? -Sure, you’ll love it.
Ania, you got an e-mail.
What a pretty bird! It has blue legs.
Come and see what mom sent me.
-You want me to print it? -Yes, I’ll show it to Ms. Monika.
Dad? What do those birds eat?
Fish. They live by the water.
What if they were allergic to fish, like I am?
Birds can’t be allergic.
What if they could?
They’d find nice, tasty bugs.
Come on, I’m taking you to see a real film set.
Can I go?
-Just don’t lose her! -Sure!
That’s my student. She’ll recognize me.
Don’t panic, keep your distance.
Go, hide.
She looks like a princess.
That’s what we want people to think.
-The princess is shaky. -This is Ania.
-The princess is shaky. -This is Ania. -My niece, she won’t get in the way. -Ania.
-My niece, she won’t get in the way. -Ania.
Shouldn’t you be in preschool?
I’m way too old for preschool! I'm in third grade.
Do old kids like ice-cream too?
-We do! -Come along.
-Thanks. -Let’s go.
It says the horn broke.
And that’s why it won’t start?
What can I say?
It’s the 21st century.
Technology triumphs over reason.
Boss…
-I was thinking… -What?
-A drink. -We’re working.
-A drink. -We’re working. I mean, after work. Lets get a drink, have a chat.
Mechanic to mechanic.
I have a good friend.
In short-term loans.
-I’ll set you up. -Wiesiek...
You got me a loan once.
Look how it turned out.
Why don’t you sell it?
You have a debt to pay. And I have a good buyer.
No way.
My father drove it to his wedding, so did I, and so will Monika.
You said Monika…
Monika?
-I told you, I’m working overtime. -Wiesiek said that--
-I told you, I’m working overtime. -Wiesiek said that-- That’s absurd.
I have to go.
Going fishing, are we?
-No, I have a math class. -That explains the pole.
-Exactly. -This is my last warning.
This is a school.
And you’re acting like you enjoyed working here.
But the exams are coming.
And the truth will come out.
Go to sleep.
-Uncle! -What?
-Tell me a story. -Aren’t you too old for that?
Big girls like stories too.
I guess they do.
All right.
A long time ago, back when cars run on gas,
there was a…
A beautiful princess. She…
ignored a no entry sign
and drove into the dark forest.
What happened next?
In the forest,
the very dark forest, she met a witch.
And the witch magically summoned ice-cream!
Witches don’t like princesses.
Of course they don’t. It was magic ice-cream.
The princess ate it and fell asleep.
Then the witch got into her car and drove off to go fishing.
-I forgot. We don’t like fish. -I don’t.
-What do you like? -Fast cars.
Does everything has to be fast?
That’s how it is now.
But if you keep going so fast, you’ll miss everything around you.
you’ll miss everything around you.
Kids and fish better keep quiet.
-Uncle… -What is it?
You don’t like me either?
There is one little princess, smarter than all the adults I know.
She is very pretty. And very brave, too.
Now go to sleep!
-Uncle? -What now?
You need better stories.
Tomorrow.
-Uncle… -What?!
Turn off the light.
Sure, sweetie.
Goodnight.
BUY TICKETS!
-Uncle. -What?
Uncle.
I’m up now. I remember.
I remember. We just need breakfast…
I’m almost ready. Give me two minutes.
Get in, chop-chop.
What are you doing?
Don’t smoke here!
Good morning.
Finally! I almost thought you f… Fudged up.
The tickets?
You were supposed to get them.
We can’t go anywhere without them.
I forgot.
Get in!
It’s my fault. I trusted the wrong person.
Kids, back to the yard. We’ll play there.
Thanks.
Come on, move it!
This is Enzo.
I need a favor.
The chariot awaits!
Get in, everybody!
Let’s get going.
-Your uncle is not that bad. -He can drive a bus.
-He likes cars more than kids. -Who wouldn’t?
I saw a cow giving milk!
You didn’t know where milk came from?
From the fridge.
Now we’re pecking.
My wing! I broke my wing!
They’ll wear me out.
But laughing always works.
-You’ve got… -What?
You’ve got milk on your mustache.
-Wait. -Delicious!
Thanks. All we need now is…
Baked potatoes.
That’s it! You’re reading my mind.
Delicious.
Why are we so formal all the time?
-Let’s have a drink! -I don’t know you that well.
Let’s get to know each other.
You’ve known my niece for quite some time now, so…
-All right. -Great!
Ania is having so much fun here. Will her mom be back soon?
I don't know. We'll see.
-She’s lucky she has you. -And a father.
You brought her here.
I’m doing my best.
-Cool chickens. -We don’t have those in Warsaw.
-We do. In the freezer. -But they’re dead and naked.
What do they eat?
-Is it good? -Not bad, try it.
Help! Ania is dying!
What happened?
-What have you done?! -Move. Move, now!
There. It’s all right now.
Easy.
Easy. Keep breathing.
Just keep breathing.
Keep breathing.
Are you feeling better? Try to sit up.
Slowly.
-What did you eat? -I just licked it.
I bet there was fish meal in it.
It’s all right.
-Harder! -Okay, ready?
If I could, I’d buy this farm and bring the kids here all the time!
I’ve never thought about my constant lack of money like that.
-Catch me! -I’ve got you.
I’ve got you.
Aren't you loaded?
The other leg. Why would you think that?
Aren’t you getting paid in your world of luxury?
World of luxury?
Sure, I am. But you know how it is.
I want to buy a vintage car, but saving up for it takes ages.
Just like my father.
-Tell me. -Yeah?
Does a guy who keeps saving up like this
-have a shot with a top-notch girl? -What?
Like a super hot model who is also pretty smart.
Pretty smart? She’s a real catch.
-Do you like her? -I think she doesn’t like me.
-Then forget about her. -Are you crazy?
-Maybe you can try to impress her. -How?
You’re the womanizer here.
I can’t teach a playboy how to play.
Who are you? Really?
A teacher!
I guess I am.
-All right. -What is it?
First of all, you need music.
With lyrics.
Second of all, flowers.
Red roses, preferably.
Third of all. Fancy food.
Something French.
Lots of champagne.
Very old-school.
Where’s the real music?
-I thought… -Thinking doesn’t suit you.
Is there any way to impress you? Any way at all?
I’m just curious.
100 kph in under four seconds.
-It could be deadly. -It could.
If you’re not good enough.
How about a ride?
I haven’t driven that one before.
Just…
The clutch is very sensitive.
Shit.
Maybe I’ll unpark it?
Come.
-Oh God! Are you okay? -All good.
This way.
You’re kidding me!
All parts are original.
Apart from the tires and the battery.
Does it…
drive?
-You want to try it out? -Can I?
You can’t.
The owner worries it’ll get stolen.
I didn’t think you’d be…
What?
Anything I say now will come out wrong.
Then don’t say anything.
Great! We’ve got it. Let’s do one more.
-I bet they’ve been practicing. -Why is she sucking him like this.
Isn’t it a bit too long?
Then we wouldn’t get the jealousy.
It’s getting dark, back to work!
-Another take? -That’s right.
-Is something different? -Their chemistry.
They must be shagging.
I see.
Everything okay?
Don’t worry about it. Do you have a gum?
Sweet Jesus.
They say it gets easier in the second trimester.
But at this rate, I’m not sure I’ll make it that far.
Jesus!
I try not to worry too much.
I know that Enzo has a strong paternal instinct.
Congratulations.
We can always sell it. Wiesiek has a buyer.
He pays cash.
We’re not selling it. Go back to work, clients are waiting.
What did he do to you?
I got a loan from the bank.
-I’ll have the money by Friday. -Great.
Then the car is yours. It can be your dowry.
It keeps growing in value. Usually it’s the other way round.
I don’t have a husband in mind.
Maybe you set the bar too high?
Is not sleeping with other women too high?
Men often sleep with women they don’t love.
Luckily, not everyone has to get married.
You know why men get married?
Bachelors hate it everywhere.
Husbands just at home.
Mom used to laugh at your jokes.
You’re not laughing at all.
What’s there to laugh about?
Mom is looking down at you, making sure you’ll find the right one.
Let’s have a chat.
And some wine.
I don’t drink wine. Yes, you do. And it pays off.
I get it. I’m not your league.
You don’t know shit.
And keep your hands off me or you're out.
Should I tell your dad how you make your money?
-It’s all fair and legal. -Very funny.
Give me a cut, and I’ll keep my mouth shut.
Let’s say, ten grand?
Mechanic’s promise!
How about a kiss goodbye?
Kiss my ass.
-You got better. -At what?
-Pancakes. -That was a while ago.
A long while. Nine days ago.
-You counted that fast. -It was easy.
-It takes me a while. -I have a better teacher.
Swimming pool tomorrow?
Ms. Monika said you don't need to come. Staś’s dad will be there.
Is she mad at me?
She’s never mad. She just talks and explains.
-Who is mad at you? -Ania!
-You got an e-mail. -From mom?
It’s coming!
Is it?
Oh, and I checked.
Birds really don’t have allergies.
-Is it coming? -It is, one second.
It’s here!
A kangaroo!
But how did mom sail to Australia so fast?
She was in the Philippines.
Yeah, how?
Maybe she’s in New Guinea. They have kangaroos too.
And now it’s time
to jump right ahead to your room and do your homework.
Is uncle Enzo’s ex-girlfriend sailing with mom?
-Jesus. -And why is she naked?
Isn’t she embarrassed?
Pancakes, anyone?
Enzo is calling.
THREE MISSED CALLS
Call him back. Talk to him.
-Maybe later. -There’s nothing to talk about.
Maybe he didn’t know she’s pregnant.
-It doesn’t change anything. -Of course it does!
-It doesn’t change anything. -Of course it does! If he didn’t know, he didn’t lie to you.
But I still slept with the wrong guy.
Get over it.
It happens. Even to good families with pianos.
You know...
they like classical music and so on.
-I thought he was the one. -It was before or after?
Before, I wasn't thinking. Otherwise there'd be no after.
High five, guys! My poor hand!
-Give me that. -Thanks, I'm fine.
Of course you are.
Your methods didn’t work. On that girl, you know.
Maybe she wasn't as dumb as you thought.
Make sure Ania is rested on Thursday.
-We have a test. -Sure thing.
Why are you so grumpy?
I’m not. Excuse me, I have to go.
This is a rehearsal. The show will be great.
-Let me talk to Alicja about this. -You really shouldn’t.
-Alicja is very organized, so… -What?
She doesn’t like improvisation. Try to be precise.
Listen. This is not a good show, is it?
We’re just too close to it.
You think? Maybe let’s take a poll?
A poll? Now? This is our dress rehearsal.
-I need a drink. -What?
Do you live here?
-Why? -A child is in danger.
-What child? -A student.
-What child? -A student. -What student? -Listen.
-What student? -Listen.
This mousy girl, no heels, big glasses.
She lives here, that’s her student. I need to find her.
Mousy?
I know who you mean.
One lives at the fourth floor, entrance D.
The other on the second, entrance C.
Okay, thank you.
Start with entrance D.
Entrance D, okay. Thanks.
-You’re welcome. -Entrance D…
MS. ZOFIA - 22 MISSED CALLS
Klaudia's not here. Warum?
Don’t worry. I’m sure she’s on her way.
What could be more important than being here, at the rehearsal?
-Maybe she had an accident. -Accident, my ass.
I see the boss likes it all fresh. Not just ad ideas.
I wonder how they cope with the age difference.
-Different sexes. -Different tax thresholds.
What’s it called? Sponsoring.
Maybe that’s his…
niece?
I’ve heard Klaudia has uncles, too.
I’ve heard they travel together.
-Where do I find such an uncle? -Underwear shows.
-Klaudia doesn’t do public shows. -Sure.
But she must do private ones.
It’s me, your dad.
Open the door!
-Kazik! -I’m not coming out.
I’m Kazik’s dad.
My wife told me to pick him up. He won’t come out.
I never hit him!
Kazik. You wanted to talk to me.
It’s hard talking through the door. Can I come in?
Just you, not my dad.
Okay.
-I can’t come out. -Why?
Everyone will laugh and dad will say I’m a girl.
What happened?
Łukasz spilled his juice on me and told everyone I wet my pants.
What do I do now?
I have an idea.
We’ll dress you up as Ali Baba.
Ali Baba? Are you messing with me?
Just a little. Come on.
Bravo. Great job. Where is Klaudyna?
Where is Klaudyna? Klaudia will be right here.
This is unbelievable. No basic… -Completely unprofessional. -I’m sure she had a reason.
-Completely unprofessional. -I’m sure she had a reason.
She is ruining the rehearsal for an event that everything depends on.
Including your life, dear.
You’re delusional.
-Can we start? -We can.
Andrzej, let’s go!
Make the kiss shorter.
Is Ms. Alicja mad at you for kissing Ms. Monika?
No, she’s not mad.
And this is Ms. Klaudia.
No, that’s Ms. Monika dressed up as Ms. Klaudia.
I don’t know why, Ms. Monika is prettier.
You’re confused.
No, I’m not.
This bird really has blue legs,
and that was Ms. Monika dressed up as Ms. Klaudia.
And in the picture, too.
No!
Ok, you can go.
Everything will be all right.
-Calm down. -Not a chance in hell!
He won't cheat on me with someone like you!
Alicja!
Klaudia, let go!
-Pull her away! -You pull her!
Let go! You broke my arm!
Touch my hair again and I’ll break both of them.
What are you doing?
Calm down.
It’s stress. Excuse me. Will you be paying the bill?
Excuse me. Will you be paying the bill?
The lady drank 500 ml of gin.
-Pay it, Szymon. -I did, so what?
I’m not a minor, I’m not pregnant. I can drink all I want!
Alicja, what’s wrong with you?
-Help me out. -Klaudyna, you're out.
Calm down.
I wanna go home. She’s not pregnant?
Pregnant? No way. Come on.
-Have you seen Klaudia? -She left.
-Alone? -Why?
I just wanted to take a closer look.
Nice chicks are like snakes.
If they want to, they can slither away.
Right.
COMMERCIAL PHOTO SHOOT 10:00 A.M. – CAFE BISTRO DINNER WITH ADAM
Thanks.
-What can I get you? -Lots of ice-cream.
-Three scopes? -Three servings.
You can’t eat that.
-Wanna bet? -How much?
-A fourth serving. -Deal.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Waiting for good luck. And you?
Same.
Here it is.
-Right. -Thanks.
-Hello! -Hi.
What a coincidence!
I’m meeting Klaudia here.
To sign a contract.
Not anymore. She is not coming.
-I’ll be off, then. -Wait.
-I’ll be off, then. -Wait. Don’t go yet.
Monika.
This is Jacek.
-The best ad man in town. -Hi.
Monika Grabarczyk.
You must be a model.
Surprisingly, no. She teaches my Andrzej’s kid.
Your Andrzej’s?
-My brother’s! -Relax, it’s the 21st century.
Klaudia is not coming, so I’ll be on my way.
-Bye, see you! -Bye!
-May I? -Sure.
Fourth one, on the house.
-Thank you. -Unbelievable.
No way. Do you need help with that?
All right. My jacket.
If you were a model, you couldn’t eat all that.
Why? Do you think teachers are fat?
They are. Especially you.
Jacek liked you. And he’s the expert.
Weren’t you ever tempted to, you know…
give modeling a shot?
Just to hear that I’m too old in a couple of years?
All girls want to be models.
Not all girls.
Who did you want to be?
-A teacher. -No way.
It’s true. I taught younger kids to read.
Who did you want to be?
I had whole notebooks filled with pictures of cars.
-I wanted to drive them. -See?
Our dreams came true.
I have one more dream.
What is it?
A walk in the rain.
-Can I give you a ride home? -I’ll take the bus.
I didn’t know the situation was so serious.
They could close your school.
That’s the worst case scenario. If the exams don’t go too well…
I’ll just get kicked out.
Ania will do good, though, right?
I don’t know.
I’m joking! She is really good.
But we need to remember she is having a tough time now.
This might affect her score.
What happens tomorrow?
It’ll be all right.
You’re unbelievable.
You’re not scared of anything?
Now I know why kids are crazy about you.
You might be right.
Childish men always liked me, too.
That’s right, I am childish.
What?
I really am childish.
-But you don’t like me. -Says who?
It’ll be all right.
Ania.
Come here.
It’ll be all right.
We’re all rooting for you.
Your dad, your uncle. Your mom, too.
Go.
This is our final judgment.
The results of this exam will determine your future in my school.
Excuse me.
Have you seen my… Here it is.
Who’s that?
Seriously? That’s Ania’s teacher.
Ania said her teacher was pretty, like her mom.
She was right.
And she’s a good teacher, too. Ania says the exam was easy.
How about…
her?
She looks like a heartbreaker. Like Kasia.
Like if she was saying, "Look at me, I'm beautiful."
Enough about Kasia! She’s a model, she has to be beautiful.
Is she haughty in person, too?
-I can’t figure her out. -You?
That’s hard to believe.
-Maybe she’s taken? -That’s not it.
-For sure? -Yes.
-That’s jealousy. -I’ve never been jealous!
That’s for monogamists.
Look. Just look at her.
I’m starting to like this one too.
Can’t you just choose one of them? They look alike.
Similar proportions, almost symmetrical face,
-eye size and position… -You’re being an architect.
And you’re not being an engineer.
I feel weird in here.
You look like dad. You talk and act like him.
Thanks.
Which one is better?
-Burgundy. -Black.
Surprising choices.
Look. They go with both dresses.
They’re pretty. Thanks.
What happened to you?
Kasia wrote me.
She says it was a mistake. She’s coming back.
She misses Ania. And me.
-That’s good, right? -For you, maybe.
I’m not like you two! What was that, a life pause?
She shouldn’t have left Ania, but we were taking care of her.
I can’t think of her with another man.
She did not cheat on you!
She did not cheat on you! She was just tired and needed a break, so she didn't lose her mind.
She was just tired and needed a break, so she didn't lose her mind.
-Get up. -Why are you so understanding?
I’ve been through all the laundry, school trips and swimming pools.
It takes a hero to do all that.
-She left! -She has big dreams.
You kept a wild bird in a cage. You’re lucky she’s coming back.
So suddenly?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
This night will be filled with special cars and special ladies.
It’s time to meet the protagonists of our romantic story.
Why are we here?
You’ll see.
If I’m right, your jaw will drop to the floor.
The stunning Klaudia
And the one and only Enzo!
I don’t have time for this. I’ve got things to do.
You’re just saying that, because you’ve never seen a car like this.
I invite you to watch a true story.
It would never happen
if it wasn’t for this beauty.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen! You won’t believe what happened next.
But that's another story.
What’s going on? Ania!
Help me out.
Get the medic! Now!
I need adrenaline! Now!
Hurry up.
-My daughter! -Right.
Now we know what our perfect teacher does for a living.
Shaking her butt for the guys.
What’s wrong with you?
She’s doing all of that for me, to help me.
You know what, Wiesiek?
You’re a crappy person.
That’s for lying about my daughter.
What a great leader, huh?
He gave a TV interview. He has a media presence now.
All those darned creeps will be mean to Monika.
-I told you this would end badly for her. -She wasn’t doing nude shots.
It’s a very good excuse to get rid of the odd one out.
My dear colleagues.
The school board decided to terminate the employment
of Ms. Monika Grabarczyk.
Wait a minute.
So?
You think that’s fair?
Stop smoking!
I’m so mad.
That was a stupid idea, but the debt is paid.
I’m mad at myself! For letting that happen.
For burdening you with my problems.
-That’s what family is for… Sorry -Ouch.
That’s not what it’s for.
A father should protect his children, not put them in harm’s way.
I’m sorry. I should have figured it out.
You didn’t stand a chance.
-Why? -Because you’re naive like a child.
And you have a good heart. That’s why those bastards used you.
They’ll terrorize you, drag your name through the mud.
-I don’t regret it. -Don’t try to make me feel better.
I was so popular.
You’re usually careful with men.
I am. But Klaudia isn’t.
Klaudia? Oh, right!
-Stop crying. -I’m not crying.
Yes, you are.
I was going to introduce a new math program.
I’m so ashamed.
You shouldn’t be. You look great, all pimped up.
Great.
But why do kids have to suffer?
-What? -What were you thinking, saying that?
-What? -What were you thinking, saying that? Leave her alone.
Calm down. Nothing is set in stone yet.
The headmaster is talking to the parents.
Do you see that?
Oh my!
Look at that!
You have to see this.
Ms. Monika! Ms. Monika!
Let’s go join them.
Ms. Monika!
This calls for a smoke!
-This tension… -Don’t do it.
-Darn, I’m out. -Great!
Get a candy bar.
-The best specialists couldn't do it. -We want to--
I understand you’re here to complain about Ms. Grabarczyk?
Not at all.
-I’m Kazik’s dad. -I remember.
Thanks to Ms. Monika, my son stopped stuttering.
She saved my daughter’s life.
-We don’t want another teacher. -Exactly.
Excuse me. Come in!
-The results. -Thank you.
Exam results. Now we’ll know everything.
I’m mad the kids have to go through this.
Monika…
Or Klaudia? What do I call you now? -I’m confused. -Which one do you prefer?
-I’m confused. -Which one do you prefer?
Twice the beauty. Twice the brilliant mind.
Now you’ll say it was my fault.
I won’t.
Monika teased you. Klaudia provoked you.
Now they’ll both pay for it.
I have to thank you.
For what?
Doctors say you saved Ania’s life.
And I ruined mine.
My brother invites you to dinner. Will you come?
Perfect. We can honor the death of my career.
Which one?
We have the test results. Come with me.
The exam results in our school are mostly average.
Only one class achieved a very different score.
It comes as no surprise that it was Ms. Monika’s class.
I was right all along.
Ms. Monika is a great teacher
and she deserves an award for the best result in the district.
Bravo!
Nine points above average with very balanced scores.
-Congratulations to all of you. -Thank you.
For you. From all of us.
Thank you. But why the golden roses?
They were no diamond ones.
Ms. Monika has a boyfriend!
Enzo and Monika Sitting in the tree
K-i-s-s-i-n-g!
I’ll show you the pictures my mom sent me.
The pictures were a good idea. The kid is elated.
Don’t even.
It was an honest mistake. Haven’t you ever done it?
You haven’t, right?
Are you really moving out?
I’ll miss Ania.
-Did you order something? -No.
Ania! Can you check who’s at the door?
-It’s mom! She’s back! -Kasia?
I’m glad it all worked out.
Honestly, though…
I kinda liked it.
-You don’t like kids! -What?
Enzo didn’t like kids. Stefan loves them.
-Where to now? -I don’t know.
-You’re driving. -No way!
That's Samanta Sosa, the junkie who was a regular at the precinct.
A spark started the fire. She was asleep and couldn't react.
Looks like she was drunk.
Paredes found her a couple hours ago.
He's still scared shitless.
That Sami was a good-looking girl.
It's a shame, man. We always lose the best.
A FEW HOURS BEFORE
-How'd it go? -Fine.
I'll go give Manchado a bath and some water. He's beat.
Okay.
Come on, Manchado.
Do you want to see the masks your kids ordered for tonight?
No, it's their party.
I'll check the girls and try to catch the game.
The black apron is fine.
No makeup.
Or accessories.
Luis is here.
Aren't you running late, ma'am?
Even better.
Rómulo can wait for me.
How are you, Luis?
Oh, honey.
Careful. It's really crowded. Stay close.
We're near Toto's mom's stand.
Fine, go. Be careful.
If I didn't know you, I'd say you're still into him.
But you do know me.
Right. Just saying.
After two years, you can say hi. He won't bite.
Auntie, no.
It'd be good for you to go out.
I'm here.
I don't mean once a year.
Paco, you came!
I'm here with you.
I didn't know you were back.
I thought Paco would stay in Madrid.
Apparently not.
Just accept it already. Your brother calls him.
What's more annoying?
To be forgotten or unnoticed by him?
Sami, what are you doing? Estela is right there.
Take that stuff to the kitchen.
Do I know you?
Nahuel Mamani!
You're under arrest for robbery!
-Stop. -Don't take him, please!
-Come on. Get up. -Stop. Let her go.
Easy.
Shut your mouth.
-Easy. -Let her go!
Easy, I said!
Easy!
-Please! No! -Get off her, Pérez.
-Who's there? -Evening, ma'am.
I'm Luis Paredes, Juan's dad. Sorry for the scare.
Your son knows me.
Is something up?
I'm on the cougar's trail and wanted to keep on it.
I saw it two hours ago on the road.
-Can I go across here? -Sure.
Listen, Ms. Manuela, keep your door shut tight.
That animal is fierce.
Especially since you're on your own.
Thank you.
Mom?
What's up?
It's nothing.
I just couldn't sleep.
Manuela, Sami was found dead.
I can't hear you. Hi.
Samanta Sosa.
She was found dead at the Pico del Águila shelter.
PRECINCT 57 LA QUEBRADA
Could she have stopped by while we were at the party?
Is anything missing?
No. I was in the shed. Why ask if something's missing?
Earlier she stole an expensive necklace from her employer.
-Where was she working? -At the Carreras's party.
Thanks for coming in.
That's fine. I came here as soon as I heard.
-Hi there! -I want to see Nahuel Mamani.
You got lonely up in the sticks and came looking for a real man?
You little…
How can we help, Luna?
-Pérez, finish that report. -Yes, sir.
-Have you seen him? -Not yet.
Let me in, Rufino. I want to see him.
He's in solitary. I can't.
He was beaten up.
He's hurt.
It's out of my hands. He resisted arrest.
I need to talk to him. Help me, please.
I'll tell him anything you want on your behalf. CAUSE OF DEATH: FIRE/ACCIDENT
That's all I can do.
-You can believe me. -Go on.
Let him through.
-My pleasure. -See you.
INCOMING CALL ALICIA
Tell my niece
what you told me.
Who ordered you to clean all this up?
The town council.
They will build a post so people can be safe.
Did you know the woman who died?
Yes, Sami.
She came often.
Here and the north chapel.
Sami wasn't religious.
She stole a necklace from the Carrerases, slept at the post, and had the accident.
Why did she go by your house?
She took a shortcut.
My place is on the way from the ranch.
Why not my place?
She was by herself. And she didn't always drop by.
She was making an effort.
We know how these cases go. How many relapses for every recovery?
What are you implying?
That her addiction killed her and she had it coming?
I didn't say that.
I said it looks like an accident.
I got the report.
When the autopsy report is ready, I'll close it.
I'll get statements from the Carreras's staff.
You won't need to.
García talked to the help.
And brought the girl's belongings from the house.
Ask him.
I got Manuela Pelari's statement. She's Alicia's niece.
She was the last one to see Samanta Sosa alive.
What should I do with Ms. Carreras's necklace?
Leave it with me.
I'll get it to her.
What the police say isn't good enough. They don't care.
Yesterday I was with her. Now she's dead.
I need your help.
If she had a relapse or an accident, I want to know for sure.
I'll accept it, but only if you can confirm it.
It's the least I can do to lay her to rest.
I am as sad and surprised
as the rest of you by what happened recently.
Our town is mourning.
CANDIDATE An innocent girl's disappearance is a tragic incident
that makes us reflect on the precarious state of the facilities
that the town council is liable for.
What amazes me the most is the Mamani family's report.
Was it an unlawful arrest?
We don't know.
What's your fucking job, Mellino?
Tell me.
A Qulla leader ended up beaten.
A girl scorched to death.
All in less than four hours.
Nahuel's arrest should have been clean-cut,
a model arrest.
And instead, the family is claiming police brutality.
And the Qulla girl?
What's your excuse with her?
Why won't you listen, Rómulo?
Mamani resisted arrest.
What happened to that girl was an accident.
A god-awful coincidence, but an accident all the same.
I don't give a fuck about the Qulla.
But I want to lay it out for you.
We are four days away from elections.
Torres is lashing out in the media.
The mining company is pressuring me. Plus, Etelvina.
The Americans' deal feeds us all.
Keep your end of the bargain.
I know fully what my duty is.
Just had bad luck.
Nahuel is locked up. He's no trouble.
Get Mamani a doctor, food, clothes, whatever.
On it.
-They can't see him all beaten up. -Okay.
Don't make me do something I don't want to do.
Let's keep things civil.
You get it.
LA QUEBRADA POLICE DEPARTMENT NAME: SAMANTA SOSA
Hello?
Hello?
CELL PHONE TRACING AND TRACKING REQUEST
NUMBER 387 4638896
My niece Manuela needs to ask you some questions.
Go ahead.
It's about Samanta Sosa.
Did you know her?
It's important for me that you answer.
No… but I knew who she was.
When they hold events at the house, we hire people. Extra staff.
María recommended her.
María is trustworthy.
I saw it as reason enough to hire her.
Alicia, I know how much you help these girls.
And I know everything you do, but not all of the girls are good.
Why do you say that?
Like I told the officer,
she ran off when I caught her stealing.
It surprised me to see Ms. Mecha's necklace on her.
And what happened then?
I told her to put it back immediately.
But she was very upset.
She said it wasn't her and she didn't steal anything.
-Did you see her again after that? -No.
I looked for her, but that's when she must have fled.
You can ask María.
They were friends.
Excuse me, María Segovia's house?
Right there, at the corner.
Hi.
Are you María, Samanta's friend?
Yes.
I'm Manuela, Alicia Pelari's niece.
-What do you want? -To know what happened.
They say it was an accident.
Yes.
And she was caught stealing.
Says who?
Estela.
She had the necklace. Why?
You knew her well. Did she seem off?
Off how?
Drugs?
Sami was clean. That's why I got her the job.
Did you know she hid her loot at the chapel?
I don't know anything.
LA QUEBRADA BREAKS THE RECORD WITH CRUZ CARRERAS
Would you come with me, Captain?
Thanks, Estela.
I wanted to bring it myself.
-I thought I'd lost it. -I know how important it is.
Did you recognize it?
It was my mother's.
I haven't worn it in ages.
I gave it to Mechita for her wedding.
And now you need to calm down, Etelvina.
It's over.
I'm worried about Cruz.
He got worse.
Do you want me to talk to him?
Or if there's anything else you need. You know you can count on me.
As always.
You've done enough.
I don't know how to thank you.
It's best if you leave now.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Hey! Give me a kiss? Oh, okay.
They are all there.
ESTIMATED LOCATION
Hoodie, gloves…
Your description suggests he's not just any burglar.
Do you think this guy may have known you?
I don't get what you mean.
I mean, it may have not been a random break-in.
There are no thieves in La Quebrada who fit that description.
Perhaps they want something from you.
Or someone has a personal grievance against you.
No.
Is that registered?
What did you do for a living before coming to La Quebrada?
I've lived here for ten years.
I work in the field.
Ms. Pelari, we too want to find the man who attacked you.
I was in the police.
In the police?
We're colleagues then.
What division?
Violent crimes.
That's why I retired.
Well, you know this makes the situation totally different.
You worked in a division where it's easy to make enemies.
Think about it, please. Think hard. Try to remember.
Someone could be after you to settle a score.
No one's after me.
I'm not on the run.
Of course not.
I didn't say that.
Okay.
Any more details?
No, that's it.
Call me anytime.
-Yes, thank you. -All right.
Let's go.
CORNELIA VILLALBA CASE
I thought by letting go of Cornelia, I was paying my debt.
But then it became a black hole.
For you, Cornelia
was a childhood friend,
not a dealer.
I was a cop, and I let her go. That was a mistake.
A mistake you already paid for, Manuela.
Why punish yourself?
What for, anyway?
It was useless.
That is not true.
It made you become who you are now.
I fight with that person every day.
When you brought me here, I swore Tobías and I would have a violence-free life.
Without Pipa.
What happened today isn't connected to your past as a cop.
It isn't.
I know.
Well, then…
what's wrong?
The guy checked outside first.
Why there?
He knew Samanta was here, so he came.
In that case, it wasn't an accident.
FULL NAME: MANUELA PELARI
…RECKLESS BEHAVIOR…
Rufino.
Luna, why come now?
It's his birthday. He cried all day long.
He wants to see his dad.
Let us in just for a few minutes.
I told you he's in solitary.
I don't want problems.
Let's go, baby.
Okay.
Luna!
Play.
NORTHWESTERN PATO CLUB
Your brother should be here. What happened?
I don't know.
He's not answering.
I can't manage everything constantly.
It's a key moment for the mining company, the election…
Why is that contract so important, Mom?
Come on, Mechita.
When will you understand it's not a contract?
It's what I've been building for 25 years.
I ask for two things.
Two.
Focus on your engagement, and handle your brother as usual.
This time is different.
Then grow up, darling.
Think like a daughter of mine, not about nonsense and parties.
-Agustín. -Etelvina.
-My dear. -How are you?
Ready for tonight's toast?
Yes.
-I'm very happy. -That's good.
Why couldn't Cruz make it?
A migraine. A last-minute thing.
If you'll excuse me, I need to go.
Of course.
Without Cruz, this team sucks.
Cruz sucks.
Come on, honey.
Don't start.
You're telling me not to start? Look,
You're telling me not to start? Look, I came back after five months to announce our engagement
because you and Dad asked me to.
I get here, and your brother is in the worst shape ever.
He's going through a rough patch.
He always is.
He knows you're moving to London?
I was thinking about that.
Can we take him with us?
You think I don't realize how things stand, but know this.
I don't want Cruz in our lives, Mecha.
He's a ticking time bomb.
So, think it through.
Sooner or later, you'll have to choose.
You can't have us both.
It's him or me.
It's freezing cold.
After a while, you won't notice. You'll see.
-Do you regret the other day? -Yes.
Don't you?
Not all of it.
It was a mistake.
-It shouldn't have happened. -Will you get married?
Why even ask? Of course I will.
Why?
-You should be clean for tomorrow's game. -Was Dad there?
Dad's dead, Cruz.
Mom will cover for me. Make something up.
-I don't want to go. -Mom only thinks about herself.
She's pressuring me.
Poor baby sis.
Stuck with the worst of us.
-Hi. -Hi.
I got a report from school.
-Something happened to Tobías? -Not exactly, but…
it's serious.
Again. Don't miss this time.
-I'll go. -Tobías skipped school. Did you know?
-What? -I think I know where he is.
Wait for me!
-Yay! -Great!
-I'm going. -No, it's my turn.
Suqu, come.
-I'll go. -No, it's my turn.
Take it. Be careful.
Take the bullet.
-Snap it. -Suqu'll miss.
Shut up, Toto.
Cock it.
On the sight. Aim there.
You can do it, Suqu.
Go, Suqu.
Tobías!
Why did you come?
I'll find you. Go home.
Hand it to me.
No.
Put it down.
It's dangerous.
Why are you doing this?
Now they'll make fun of me.
I don't care what your friends think. Hand it to me.
Do you think I can't?
It's Juan's, not mine!
-He'll be mad. -Not more than me.
-You lied to me. -You're the liar.
I hate you.
Being a single parent is hard.
I lied to him.
It's my fault.
You did it to protect him.
Thanks.
How did you find him?
By accident while tracking Samanta Sosa's lost cell phone.
Sami's cell phone is lost?
The antennas didn't find the exact spot.
They showed a broad area.
I couldn't find it.
The Carrerases live five kilometers away.
If the phone is on, someone has it.
It hasn't been on since.
It may have run out of battery or could be lost in the valley.
She could've lost it before the party. It's not conclusive.
You still think it was an accident?
There's no proof.
No sign that would justify opening a murder investigation.
You were a cop. You should know.
Maybe she didn't steal.
She had the necklace. Witnesses saw.
Did the guests give statements?
Were the Carrerases questioned?
There's no need to question anyone.
Much less the Carrerases. Do you know something?
No.
You think I don't care?
Sometimes we have to do things we don't like to uncover the truth.
I'm not like you.
-What do you mean? -Why did they fire you?
You investigated me.
I'll look into it, but promise me you won't interfere.
You're not a cop.
I have to go.
Alicia, I need a favor.
I brought this. It's your son's.
-Thanks. -Do you go hunting?
Yes, I can station myself at the Los Castillos post.
Come in.
Sorry, but
this house lacks a woman's touch.
My boy Juan's mom passed away a while ago.
The two of us manage as best we can.
Go ahead.
I know you're a hunter and Juan meant well,
but guns are off-limits for my son.
I'll deal with Juan, and it won't happen again.
I appreciate it.
I see you work for the Carrerases.
My family has always worked for them.
Juan works at their farm too?
No.
My boy is studying.
Did you see Samanta Sosa the night of the party?
No.
I wasn't at the party.
I was tracking the cougar and found her dead.
Well, Ms. Manuela, if you'll excuse me…
Okay.
She'll talk to you, not with the police.
Thank you.
Don't thank me.
She's back because Alicia asked.
If she thinks you can find out what happened to Sami, fine.
But no one can know.
Including Rufino.
Okay.
Where is she?
Anything you can tell me is useful.
Sami was having the best night ever.
Looked like a princess.
Mirror, mirror on the wall…
-who's the fairest of them all? -Grow up.
Your jokes disgust me.
You gave my favorite necklace to that grubby Indian.
Are you jealous?
Are you for real, Cruz? Stop.
You know you're the only one I care about.
Did you go crazy?
-Ms. Mecha is furious. -What for?
-Her necklace. -Cruz gave it to me.
Return it and get back to work. Estela can't know.
The boss is not who you think.
The boss never cared for us.
He does for me.
He'll take me to tomorrow's game and introduce me to important people.
He says I can model if I want.
Don't let him fool you. He's just annoying his sister.
Why are you saying that?
You're jealous.
What are you doing? You're ruining everything.
Want me to be happy?
Give those things back while you can.
It's not too late.
That's the last I saw of her.
Had I insisted, she might be alive.
None of it is your fault.
You should understand that.
Luna said that, but you don't know how I feel.
I do know.
Years ago I lost a friend. Cornelia. And it marked my life forever.
But not because she passed,
but because I felt responsible for not having done enough to help her.
What did you do to stop that feeling?
I did nothing.
I still think I could have saved her.
What do you drink?
The same.
I've never seen you here.
That's odd.
So, what do you think?
Is an age difference a problem for you?
No.
For you?
She was 16.
What's this?
At your party. You gave her your sister's necklace.
Yes.
We were having fun.
Except she turned up scorched somewhere in the sticks.
What?
I didn't know she was dead.
Listen up. Everyone saw the two of you.
And she was found dead.
What happened? What did you do?
I didn't harm her. I swear.
-Sorry. I should go. -Don't, please.
What happened at the party?
-Nothing. -Do you have her phone?
Cruz.
I've been calling you for an hour. Go with your sister. She's tense.
-I would be too if I had to marry Agustín. -Stop, Cruz.
I'll see you there.
I'm sorry, but Mom's orders must always be carried out.
What do you need?
Information.
Would it be easier if I talk to you?
I don't think we have a lot to talk about.
Samanta Sosa.
Worked for you the night she died.
Yes, I heard. Poor girl.
If her family needs help, just come to us.
-There's no need to involve my son. -But your son knew her.
He knows a lot of people, but I doubt he knew her.
Cruz gets mixed up. Don't believe everything he says.
His health is delicate.
And do you look after him?
Yes.
Just like you.
You're a mom too, right?
It's an important day for my family.
Please leave your questions for another time.
I know about your aunt's work with the communities.
I respect her for that.
We help out too.
We did even before she came here.
They claim the land the mining company wants.
Will you help with that?
The land has been in the family for generations.
If it's a matter of ancestral claims, theirs go a bit further back.
I see now the topic interests you.
I pegged you as someone who liked her solitude.
You don't know me.
You're right. You don't know me either.
If you'll excuse me…
Manuela, right?
Manuela Pelari.
I go by Pipa.
Good night to you, Pipa.
Good evening, everyone.
Thanks for coming.
I'd like to say this union makes me very happy.
And on today's engagement,
we'll set a date for the wedding, and a year from now,
these two young lovebirds will join their lives forever.
And two close families
will become one.
Welcome, my dear.
Thanks, Dad.
Thank you, Rómulo.
This is the happiest day of my life.
To be topped only by the day I walk down the aisle
on my brother's arm.
As you know, this is a longtime dream of mine.
And it came true, my love.
To the future, and to our children's happiness…
-Cheers. -Cheers.
Hooray for the couple!
Hooray for love!
Cheers.
So, you did come.
I had to go somewhere first.
Your call got me curious. Is it personal or work-related?
Both, I guess.
I misjudged Cruz Carreras.
Why is that?
I was just with him.
He learned from me that Samanta was dead. Had no clue.
-You were with the Carreras's boy? -Yes.
And the mother.
I'm missing something. I don't know what.
I need your report and photos from the scene.
Nothing I can do will get you off this case, right?
No. I don't want to get you in trouble.
You don't care if you do.
At least don't lie.
If you want me as an accomplice, answer this.
Why'd you stand me up?
Huh?
I can't remember.
It was so long ago.
Fine.
I'm not good at choosing men.
How do you know? I never got a chance.
It's not you.
I'm poor company.
Believe me.
That should be for me to decide.
-Maybe there's another reason. -Why is it then?
Out of fear of liking me.
You don't know me.
-We're very different. -Then allow me to.
Look what you did to it!
Turn up the volume. Come on.
This is how La Quebrada Police treat us.
White people's police.
INDIGENOUS LEADER AGAINST THE POLICE
No doctor was called.
We need to be seen,
to be heard.
Will we keep allowing this?
It was Luna.
I let her in.
Our community is in danger.
It's our land.
We have a right to it.
Cut it off.
Mayor Oregón's military arm subjugates us. It doesn't protect us.
That's what happened with Nahuel Mamani's violent arrest.
And that's not all.
What really happened to Samanta Sosa? CANDIDATE
Do you know the guy in the photo?
It's Agustín Oregón, the mayor's son.
That photo was taken just hours before Sami was found dead.
Those in power, and their kids, have a lot to answer for.
That bastard.
-What was that, Dad? -Relax.
I'm tired of your problems!
-It has nothing to do with you. -You're not in my shoes.
Leave already. No one wants you here.
-Agustín! -No, Agustín.
That's it, Mercedes.
I have to get out of this fucking town!
Let's leave now, get married in London, and never come back!
What's so funny?
-Agustín. -Don't!
Registration, please, miss.
Why was I pulled over?
Checkpoint.
I have a suggestion for you.
Mind your own business from now on.
Get it?
No, I don't.
If you keep bugging the Carrerases, you'll be facing harassment charges.
And I won't be as nice as I am now when I have to bring you in.
So, listen to me very carefully.
Keep being such a pain,
and not even your white face or those slutty eyes will save you.
That clear?
I'm waiting.
Yes, it's clear.
Here you go.
Your fiancé approved?
Does it hurt?
I needed to come too.
It's my favorite place.
Our best years.
I wish we could go back.
What I did was wrong, Mecha.
-I can't get it out of my head. -It was an accident.
You did it for me, to protect me.
Like when I almost drowned here as a girl.
You saved me. Remember?
The same way.
Now I'm the one drowning.
You can't leave me alone.
You'll leave me.
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know.
I didn't know how.
Look at me.
Stop hurting yourself. Promise me.
Okay?
Do it for me.
You leaked María's photo of Samanta with the mayor's son.
We needed to be heard, to be seen.
You exposed María and messed up the inquiry.
You don't know if he was in on it, yet you implicated him.
So that Oregón loses?
Someone killed Samanta.
Do you care?
And you? Are you okay with this?
It's their land.
You asked me for help.
You only see part of the problem we have on our hands.
You don't know what's at stake. They've ruled for ages,
go unpunished, run the town, and use us.
They make a fortune off our land.
If Oregón loses, we may have a shot at getting it back.
What about Samanta?
Whatever your intentions, if we never find out what happened, you're no different.
I'll never be like them.
You think we can choose?
We can't.
Neither did Samanta.
I should leave you two alone.
Manuela,
they have their reasons.
You can't judge them.
Besides, the scandal can help.
Sami's death is all over the news.
There's nothing conclusive. No proof, no suspects,
and no motive except for some circumstantial photos at a place
and a time not coinciding with her death.
I lost my way.
Follow the winding road.
A cop threatened me last night.
They work for the Carrerases and came for me after I talked to Cruz.
Everyone here works for the Carrerases.
Yes.
Everyone.
Silence, please.
Dear journalists,
not everything goes in politics.
Of course not.
But candidate Torres seems oblivious to this fact.
My family and I were pained to see him on the news last night,
playing dirty by framing my son Agustín
with a photo taken out of context.
And I'm not worried because my son Agustín
has nothing to hide and can defend himself.
But young Samanta Sosa
can't do that.
And it worries me that they'd use her death to get a few votes.
We won't allow that.
I agree with the mayor.
At the precinct that I run, we're investigating this tragedy,
and since the beginning, the inquiry has been overseen by Mr. Rufino Jerez,
a respectful and valued member of the Qulla community.
Thank you, Captain.
I think I have something. Paredes lied.
He said he wasn't at the party, but he went by my house dressed up.
Then María confirmed it.
Whoever it was, they may plan to disappear.
I'll watch the Los Castillos post.
Preliminary autopsy reports rule out firearms and sharp weapons.
Agent Jerez, after Nahuel Mamani's video went viral
with the report of his brutal beating at the hands of the police,
how do you respond?
-About that topic-- -Good question.
Sorry, Jerez. I'll be responding.
Precisely to inform you
that Officer García, who's in charge of the operation,
has been discharged from the force.
What is unclear--
La Quebrada needs to be a paradise again.
So, please don't fall victim to Torres's manipulations.
So that our town can go back to having progress and peace.
What are you doing here?
I want to talk to you.
You've been spying on me for a while. Why is that?
Why did you lie to me?
Why deny going to the party?
-Leave. -No.
You were tracking Samanta, not the cougar.
-What do you want? -To help you.
I'll do my best if you tell me what happened.
You don't know what you're getting into.
You followed her after the party.
All the way to my house, to the post.
What happened?
Why did you chase her?
Did she seem different then?
Did she reject any advances from you?
What are you suggesting?
She led you on all night, right?
You couldn't resist?
You were alone with her in the middle of nowhere,
you forced her,
she fought back,
and you got mad.
No.
I'm not a pervert.
It was an accident… right?
A mistake?
What happened?
I never meant to hurt her.
Let's go.
Come on.
Chop-chop.
-Go on, let's move! -Okay, I'm coming!
Turn yourself in.
No.
No.
That girl was in the wrong place, like you are now. Do you get it?
Why did you look for her? What did you want from her?
Go on.
What will you do?
Will you kill me too?
Leave.
Drop the gun!
Come out with your hands up!
Are you okay?
Yes. He fled through the back.
-Will you be okay alone? -Yes.
Tobías will stay with Alicia.
Accept police protection. Paredes could come back.
No, thanks. I'd rather look after myself.
Your partner almost blew my brains out.
We asked the capital for backup to find him.
He knows the area.
He wasn't going to kill me. He was about to turn himself in.
He'll only come for his son.
He killed Samanta.
Yes, but why?
Besides, he smothered her, but it was not a premeditated crime.
He wouldn't do the fake fire setup.
That was planned.
Designed to erase something he did. He has an accomplice.
There's a cover-up.
I hurt the guy who broke into my house. Paredes was fine.
Are you positive?
Yes.
Has Sami's phone been on?
Yes, earlier at the valley's entrance.
Please tell me when it's on. Don't tell a soul.
I need to go.
I'm leading the investigation only because it's now good for them.
In any case, I'm responsible.
Be careful.
You too.
What are you doing here?
The police are looking for you.
What happens to my son if I go to jail?
No jail for anyone.
Go to the backwoods until things settle down.
Leave Juancito to me. Don't worry. He'll have everything he needs.
I was only following orders, ma'am.
The responsibility is yours alone.
I didn't ask you to kill anyone.
Open up, Mom.
Leave, Luis.
What did you do?
They killed her.
It was you.
I was protecting you, as usual.
No. From what?
It wasn't me.
Your stupid decisions killed her.
She saw you.
Otherwise, she would be unharmed.
What did you want? To make your sister jealous?
Huh?
Gave her your sister's clothes, necklace.
What were you thinking, son?
They only want money to get pregnant. Can't you see?
That's not true. Not everyone is like you.
Do you think I haven't heard? Don't play saint with me.
Do you think it hurts?
I don't feel a thing.
I don't care.
I'm going to talk.
Good day.
Where's the paperwork?
Look who's here. The new boss.
The new boss is here.
I know, the new boss. I say hi, see?
Okay, I'll piss off. I'm taking the van.
ESTIMATED LOCATION LOS CASTILLOS
GPS TRACKING ON SAMANTA SOSA
Yes. I'll handle it.
Her phone was turned on in the Los Castillos area.
Hold on.
LOS CASTILLOS GULLY Paredes found the cougar's last tracks there.
There's more.
Other policemen are on their way to track the phone.
Mellino's orders.
So, it was them who broke into my house.
That phone must have something on it.
Yes.
But who has it?
Take a photo as proof.
What is it?
Tracks.
Whose tracks?
A cougar's.
-Boy. -Why are you here?
To talk to you.
About what?
Take my statement.
Think.
You have nothing to say to the police.
-I did something awful. -That means squat.
Who you are and what you'll do means something.
Look that way.
That is your town.
It's your land.
Your legacy is your duty.
Your mom is managing everything now.
When the time comes, it'll be your duty, boy, to step in.
-I don't want to. -You don't understand, dammit!
Listen, Cruz.
Look at me.
Being a Carreras isn't a choice.
That's how it is.
No officer will take your statement.
Go back home right now.
Your mom's worried sick.
Let's turn around.
We can't go through.
They want Mamani.
-I'll call for backup. -No, I'll handle it.
Stay with the detainee.
-No recordings. Put that away. -Go on.
So, you're calling the shots.
Our freedom of expression with a peaceful demonstration.
Worried about Mamani?
Mamani?
Bring him.
Damn it…
Come on here, Mamani, get here.
There's your Mamani. Look.
There he is.
Hey, no contact.
-Don't touch her, you bastard. -Shut up.
As long as it's not the whore bitch that popped you out, dirty Indian.
Stand up. I didn't hurt you.
And you, you can't take a criminal, understood?
If he is a criminal, then I am too.
Grandpa also wants to play hero.
Come detain him. Take him.
Handcuff him. Come on.
Cuff them, quickly. One by one, they'll fall.
Go on, do it.
Call Jerez so he can bring the van and I can take them all.
LOS CASTILLOS - 45 KM
Show me the gun, okay?
Sure.
-Yeah, it's great. -It is.
-Can I shoot? -No, it's my mom's.
-What do I do if the cougar comes? -Run, I guess.
According to Juan, if you do, it'll attack.
Oh, fine.
The cougar!
Fucking kids!
You'll all be arrested.
Go, get them!
Paredes!
I'll get you!
Give me the phone!
-I don't have it. -Who does?
-Tobías. -Who?
Tobías Pelari.
Get lost! Get going!
You're not going anywhere, boy.
Stop it!
Settle down!
Come, boy!
Come back, boy!
ESTIMATED LOCATION LOS CASTILLOS
Jerez, it's been five minutes.
Luna, if you take him, he'll become a fugitive.
Will he live in hiding?
Rufino's right.
Okay, I'm done waiting.
Come on, handcuff her.
Go.
Want to face disciplinary action?
I am responsible for Mamani's protection, not you.
You're not telling me what to do. I'm your senior officer.
I am now an actual officer appointed to Samanta's case.
You think you'll get a medal for that, stupid?
-I said, do it. -No.
Lala, let him go.
Take him.
Oh, so you're with the half-caste too.
You bunch of wimps.
I guarantee his safety and due diligence in his statement.
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.
Okay.
Let's go.
You're a traitor.
Expect disciplinary action.
We'll see what the boss says.
What's with you?
You broke into Manuela Pelari's home to get Sami's phone.
-Where did you get hurt? -Are you accusing me?
I know you're involved in the cover-up of her death.
So, what do you want?
For you to think about what will be best for you when all this comes out.
If you help, your involvement is minor, unlike what's behind it.
Mellino will handle it.
Maybe, maybe not.
Fine.
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing? Fuck you, asshole!
-Why are you here? What's wrong? -We tracked the cougar.
Do you have Samanta's phone?
El Suqu does. He was recording the hunt for you.
Hey! What happened?
-Where were you? -I didn't mean to.
I didn't mean to shoot.
Calm down. What are you talking about?
We were hunting.
You had a gun?
Yes.
Mom's gun.
It went off and the policeman fell. I'm going to jail.
No, honey.
No one's going to jail.
Yes. They're looking for me.
They wanted the phone.
I found it outside the yard.
I didn't steal it. I swear I meant to give it back.
Are the police looking for it?
Are you sure?
Auntie.
Auntie.
Auntie.
Go look for your mom through the back door. Run and don't stop.
Tell her everything and give her the phone.
Cruz.
Hi, Mecha.
Cruz, where are you?
I'll go find you.
Did you know they killed her?
Yes.
I wanted to tell you.
Everything. I shouldn't have lied.
Where are you?
Let me help you.
I can't even say what I did.
I'm tired of feeling like shit.
What are you saying?
You were the most important person to me.
What?
I still am.
I love you.
Listen to what I'm going to tell you.
It was my fault.
It wasn't you,
it was me.
I killed him.
Cruz?
Cruz!
Cruz!
Cruz!
Mom!
Mom!
No!
No! Cruz!
No!
Mom!
Captain.
Is something up?
Alicia.
We need to discuss something important. Can we come in?
I'd rather we talk here.
Alicia, let's talk inside. Please.
This is your niece's gun.
What do I have to do with it?
Pipa's not here.
I'm looking for the boy, her son.
-What for? -He shot one of my men.
It wasn't serious, but things could get worse.
Tobías could never do such a thing.
He was armed with other boys in the backwoods.
My men found them while tracking a fugitive.
Alicia.
Will you answer?
Look, Mellino, I told you I don't know anything, and I'm alone.
The signal is still here, and the horse is outside.
Don't make me do something I don't want to do.
I know your nephew's here. Bring him now.
No.
Okay, García. Search the whole house.
Fine!
The boy's not here.
But I have the phone.
Okay.
Fine.
Listen, Alicia.
You have my word nothing will happen to Pipa or the kid.
But this needs to end now.
You're right.
Chief?
Follow her.
Is Sami's phone with you or inside?
How many did you see?
Three of them.
Get out of my house now.
She wouldn't give us anything.
Get every unit on Manuela Pelari
for Alicia's murder.
Yes, sir.
What's up?
No signal. They turned it off.
It must be close.
The boy fled.
On the horse, to the woods.
Fuck!
Come with me, you hear me?
Go on, García, go!
You stay here.
You're tough, you old whore.
You don't want to die?
I don't understand a damn thing you're saying.
I'll help a little.
Now you'll see what your fate is.
You're really hot, you slut.
I feel lonely here.
Don't you want to marry me? Huh?
The cell phone.
Yes.
I've got it.
Give it to Rufino.
Go
with Tobías.
Don't go looking for them.
Promise me.
The boy's not here. He played us.
Hey, what's with you?
Leave, Paco.
Relax you two. Hey, it's me!
-Get out! -Get out of here, you pervert!
You're calling me a pervert?
Look at you.
No. Don't start imagining things.
-Easy. -Not much left to the imagination.
Shut up, you bitch! You always wanted to fuck Cruz.
Someone beat me to it.
Stop, Mecha.
-What? Stop. -What's up?
Relax.
-You perv. -I'll kill you, bastard!
Why do you get like this?
Get him out of here, Cruz!
I'm not afraid of you, bitch Barbie!
-Snap out of it. -No.
Hey, what's up with you?
Get Mom. Call an ambulance.
Mom? An ambulance? Are you nuts? No one can see you.
Get the SUV, we'll put him in.
Don't tell a soul, okay?
Come on, Cruz! Go!
Go on.
What happened?
What are you doing here, Paco?
Why did you come?
You didn't have to.
Cruz.
Where did he go?
I'll tell everyone, you'll see.
What will your mom say now?
No chip, they won't find us.
I'll take you to the border.
Come on.
Does it hurt?
A little.
Calling all units.
Arrest warrant for Manuela Pelari. License plate 470.
Mom.
Hold on tight.
Unit 12 here. Now in pursuit of the fugitive.
Light blue Ford truck.
License plate VTG280.
Engaging pursuit. I repeat, engaging pursuit.
Come on, lady!
Move!

You're wanted for murder.
They killed her.
Mellino killed Alicia.
What?
Go.
And Paredes too.
I have Sami's phone.
I'm at the Pico del Águila mine.
I need you to come and take Tobías.
Take Tobías? What will you do?
Pipa!
DANGER DO NOT ENTER
-So, man? -They're still inside, sir.
Okay. Go to the crosswalk.
No one comes in, you hear me?
Yes, sir.
It's a lot of blood. She's running out of time.
She must be all messed up.
Mom.
Mom.
They're coming.
Pelari!
Go that way.
You've got nowhere to run, Pelari.
Give us the phone.
Enough people have died.
You need to go.
Go hide.
Give it to Rufino.
He will find you.
I don't want to leave you.
I love you, son.
Go on. Now.
Now.
Go.
Hey!
Surrender it!
García.
The belt gun too.
It didn't have to come to this.
You know I am a magnet for policemen like you.
You told Paredes to cover it up with the fire.
Paredes is useless.
He had to frighten her and get the video back.
But why did you help him?
Why cover for the Carrerases? You didn't have to get involved.
I'm tired of cleaning up after the Carrerases.
-I didn't have a choice. -That's not true.
You didn't have to do it.
Neither did you.
Yet here we are.
I'm protecting my son.
Well, me too.
Cruz?
Give me the damn phone.
I don't have it.
No.
No, Tobías. Put it down.
Put the gun down, Tobías.
Listen to me, boy.
Give me the phone, okay?
It's okay, Tobías. Give it to him.
Forgive me, Mom.
Okay.
Do you swear to say the truth about what you know, saw, heard, or perceived
in connection to Samanta Sosa's murder?
I solemnly swear.

Mom?
How are you?
I just want to say that you don't have to feel guilty.
I'm doing fine here, while you're pursuing your dream over there.
I hope we can be together again.
Hopefully very soon.
-Who is this boy? -It's me, Ali.
-What about her? -It's you, Mom.
-And him? -That's Dad.
Dad.
What is this big statue called?
-The Statue of Liberty. -The Statue of Liberty!
Good. That means we're in New York.
-Sweetie, Mommy has to go for a while. -Okay.
Once I make it there…
I'll make sure you'll live with me in New York.
-Yeah. -Okay? Yeah.
-She's leaving from Terminal 2. -Okay.
Ali! Come here.
Ali.
Take care of Daddy, okay?
Drive safely, sir!
Ali! You'll be late for school!
How many times do I have to tell you?
Stop ruining the walls with your drawings!
Who taught you to do this? Not me!
Use your drawing books instead!
Lord, have mercy.
I gave you six months and you've failed.
And you've overstayed already.
Party knows an immigration lawyer who'll help me with my papers.
I need my wife.
I know.
But I can't go back and be nothing.
You're not nothing. You're a wife. You're a mother…
I'm more than that.
What should I tell our family?
What will they think of me? You're so selfish.
-You don't care about Ali. -Don't you dare bring Ali into this!
I bust my ass just for him!
You're the one who wants me to fail.
Fine. Stay there and never come back.
"Why didn't you reply to my letters?
Or answer my calls?
Here are tickets for you and Ali.
I had to work double shifts just to afford these,
so please don't waste them.
I beg you. Don't separate me from Ali."
I kept my promise to look after Dad.
But three months ago, he passed away.
I'm sure you've missed him so much.
I miss you a lot too.
Hurry up, Zul!
You should've gone to bed early last night.
Instead, you were on your laptop until morning! Stupid Tuber!
-We call it "YouTuber," Mom! -Shut up!
I've watched your videos.
"Ten Different Types of Sneezes." Rubbish!
Mom, you've already become my first hater. Stop meddling in my profession.
Tuber is not a profession!
Who bought the washing machine at home?
It just magically appeared!
Praise the Lord.
Let's thank our children, grandchildren,
nephews and nieces for bringing honor to our family's name.
Praise the Lord.
Our daughter, Dea,
is having her engagement party in two months.
Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord, Nara is pregnant with our fourth child!
Praise the Lord! Congratulations, girl!
And let's congratulate the Zaenal family.
They're going abroad for their Umrah.
Praise the Lord.
I'm also going abroad.
Praise the Lord.
Off on your Umrah too, Li?
I'm off to New York to find Mom.
Lord have mercy!
Wait, I thought your Mom's dead.
So you're not an orphan after all!
Sorry, my kids are foul-mouthed.
Ali, she abandoned you just to become a singer.
Before your father passed away, he assigned us to be your guardian.
You can't make rash decisions like this.
Auntie, please. I need a sponsorship letter for my visa.
Ali, stop slacking off.
Go to college instead!
You don't know anybody there. New York is dangerous.
And how do we make sure you'll pray five times a day?
You're not allowed to go. Period.
We've all tried, but your mom refused to come home.
Let her go.
Focus on your studies.
Prove that you can be successful without her.
Like going to college.
It turns out that Mom bought me a ticket,
but Dad never told me.
It's too late, Ali.
Why did you lead me to believe that she'd died?
Because you were just a child.
We came to the agreement that you didn't need to know.
And you're going to continue to lie to me?
We never lied to you.
We tried to protect you.
She's the one who lied to you.
But she's my mother.
This ticket proves she wants me to be with her.
You can't prevent a child from reuniting with his mom.
Do you have any idea where she lives?
HOUSE FOR RENT
What about electricity and water?
We use a land pump.
And the electricity goes up to 2,200 watts.
Do you live alone here?
Yes. That's why I'll move into my auntie's place just across the street.
Can we pay for six months first?
It's less hard for us to pay the rent.
Sure.
-Thank you very much. -You're welcome, ma'am.
The rent money is in!
I'll convert this to your USD account. Okay?
Sure. I still need to complete this visa application.
-Crossing my fingers you'll get it. -Amen.
I almost forgot!
-What is this? -Height growth maximizer.
What for?
American chicks don't like teeny-weeny boys.
Drink that to help you grow taller.
I'm looking for my mom, not some chicks.
Whatever. Don't forget me, OK?
Fine. Hopefully.
Look who's talking.
Ali, please don't leave.
Don't worry, I'll be back.
I beg you.
I almost forgot. Here you go.
Give me a hug.
Take good care of yourself, brother. Don't forget to take the pills.
I will.
Some snacks. So you'll save some money.
Thanks, Auntie.
Li.
Don't eat pork.
See you soon.
-Peace be upon you. -Upon you too.
Checkmate!
This was once a Thai restaurant that went bankrupt.
But my beef rendang will turn this place's fortune around.
Good energy. Love is present.
But your fortune depends on what day you were born.
I was born on a Wednesday.
Hey, Biyah. Your "love" is present.
-Wasn't it on Friday the 13th, Party? -Sir.
Eva, can you take some pictures? Thanks!
Biyah, go see if the toilet is working.
Why do I always have to deal with shit?
-Stop complaining. -I'm not!
Ance, I sense a burning aura.
It feels really hot.
-Lots of knives were being used… -Chin.
Chinta, it's a kitchen.
It will be our kitchen too. What are you thinking?
It makes sense.
Party, you must move the door an inch to the right
to welcome the flow of the chakra.
She's here to bring some peace, but why is she driving me nuts?
Toilet's fine.
-You sure? Give me a sec. -It's working.
Sir, can you give me a discount?
-What is it? -No discount on the rent.
You saggy and impotent old hag!
Thank you.
No discount on the rent.
We're short ten grand.
-How much? -Ten grand?
Don't worry. I'll just work overtime.
Yeah.
I'll do more shifts.
I can take that home nursing job.
-What about you, Biyah? -This jacket needs to be zipped up.
We'll finally own a restaurant in New York.
Amen to that.
Amen.
Okay.
More pills?
I don't have a mustache!
You're staying over, right?
As long as you keep rejecting my calls,
I will terrorize your roommate. You got that?
I see.
You're Indonesian?
Yes, Auntie.
Hold on.
Party, Ance, Biyah!
Someone's out here looking for "Mia." Anyone know Mia?
Mia?
-Who? -Are you related to her?
I'm her son.
Do you know her?
She lives here, right?
Mia.
Wait.
You know her, hon?
I don't know her. I don't know her.
He's not your bastard child? Your middle name is Mia.
It's Biyah Sumiati. But I swear he's not mine!
Then who the hell is Mia?
I thought I told you girls before.
Mia was my roommate. Here she is.
-I see. This can't be you, Biyah. -I told you.
They look alike. I sense that this kid brings luck.
Talk to him.
Let me break the news to him.
Ali?
I guess his mom must have left him when he was just a kid.
I'm Party.
And that's Ance, Chinta and Biyah.
This bag belongs to your mom.
She used to live here,
but left abruptly.
Do you know where she is now?
No, sorry.
Ali.
Have you had dinner?
Nope.
I'll fix something for you.
-Are you vegan or gluten-free? -No.
Tonight's dinner, grass. Courtesy of Auntie Chinta.
Better than eating out.
Have some dinner first, okay?
You should've checked first before you came here.
I didn't know who to ask.
What did you tell your family? You must have lied.
I didn't lie. I just didn't tell them everything.
I like this kid.
He's bold and determined!
You are bold, looking for your mom.
Determined or reckless? Where are you going to live?
In a hotel.
In a hotel.
Let's go there for happy hour!
And free breakfast buffet!
Kid, we're not on Biyah's old farm anymore.
Bitch.
What's with the language?
Stop making fun of me. I'm not some country bumpkin.
You know how expensive hotels are in New York?
I have no idea.
Jeez. No wonder.
- I told you. - So that you know.
You are so naive.
Wait a minute. Why don't you stay here?
This apartment has plenty of rooms.
He's so tiny he can fit in my room.
I don't know what you are talking about.
What a good idea!
But we also have to help him find his mom.
-You sure I won't be a hassle? -My angels are telling me…
that you will bring joy to this place. It's a yes for me.
Hello? What about my opinion?
I forgot.
How about an apartment tour?
-Let's go! -Okay.
What if he is a bad person? What if he lied?
Stop being a party pooper.
So this is my room.
So neat.
And this is Chinta's room.
Why is the bed crooked?
It's facing east, so I receive vibrations from the morning sun.
Okay, next.
This is the bathroom.
Don't forget to knock before entering.
Close the door!
I'm sorry, Auntie!
I told you to knock first!
This is Ance's room.
Do not enter!
And that's your room.
Read this.
One, always lock the front door.
Two, shower schedule. Ance, then Party, then Biyah…
She hardly showers.
Enough with the rules. You need to pay the rent. $1,500.
20 million rupiahs?
Hey! You think rent, food
and some detective work on your mom costs nothing?
So expensive?
Fair price!
Look at all this cash. I'll snatch it when you're asleep!
She won't.
Just kidding.
Oh my gosh. He was surprised by our joke.
He's got a lot of money.
Count it first.
Bi.
I'm handing it over to you. Relax.
Yoo-hoo.
Chinta's magic elixir.
Enjoy.
- Gulp it down. - It's great.
-Gulp it down! -Wheatgrass juice is always refreshing.
More, honey?
She just stopped hanging out with us.
Why's that?
She came across a white man.
Where are you living?
In Queens, with some Indonesian moms. They're all very nice.
Excuse me…
Lord, have mercy!
-Who's this? -My auntie.
Hi! I'm Chinta.
Ali is staying here with us. Let me introduce you to the others.
Ance, Biyah, Party!
Meet Ali's auntie.
-What's up? -This is Ance, and this is Biyah.
-What if I lost? -Make a bet now!
Shit! I lost my bet!
Did you just gamble our rent money away?
And some of mine, too!
What's wrong with you?
Hey there.
I'm Party.
Don't worry. We'll take care of Ali.
-Thank you. -Nice meeting you.
See? No worries, Auntie.
Give me some time to find her. I have a plan.
Are you done?
Yes, thanks.
- Please. - No!
I give you two weeks. That's it.
Fine. Talk to you later, okay?
Peace be upon you.
Lots of stagnant energy here.
Don't pull too hard.
Chin.
Ali!
I got it!
Got her address from Narti!
Mia likes to visit her boss' house a lot.
-Where does she live now? -Fort Greene. That's right.
That's fancy.
Congratulations, Ali!
Write down her address.
I will.
Thank you, Auntie!
You're killing me!
Shut up!
What are you cooking?
Beef rendang. For my mom.
Mom?
Mom?
Ali, that's the rendang for your mom.
What happened?
-Li. -I want to go home.
-Why so sudden? -Why do you suddenly want to go home?
I want my money back.
No way!
But I don't have any more cash.
Tell us what happened.
Ali, sometimes we encounter difficulties in life,
just to make us a stronger person.
Be positive, and you'll receive positive aura.
But if you keep on sulking,
we can't help you in any way.
Spill it, hon.
Ali. Just tell them.
Who's that?
I'm Ali's niece.
Not niece, but…
There you go.
Stop rambling. Tell us what happened!
Ali sent me a chat with all crying emojis.
Okay. And?
His mom pretended she didn't know him.
What?
She didn't even let him into her house. She shut the door and locked it.
I can't believe Mia's like that!
This is messed up!
-She can't do that to her own son! -Hello?
Let's kick her ass!
Wait a minute. We can't just go there…
Teach that woman a lesson!
Kicking her ass doesn't solve the problem.
It's not only about kicking her ass.
Wait. Auntie!
No kid should have to endure what he went through!
Don't act like this. At least change your clothes!
Auntie!
Auntie!
Auntie!
Stop!
Why are you upset?
Everyone's always telling me what to do.
Nobody ever listens. Ali.
I came here to see my mom. But I want to do it in the right way.
Ali, please. Don't be mad at us.
Li.
I'm sorry.
We stepped out of line and disrespected you.
-We only see you as a little kid. -But we're the childish ones.
We wanted to protect you.
We were selfish for thinking only what's best for us,
and not for you.
I'm sorry for creating all this trouble for you.
Let's just eat.
- I agree. - Okay?
Food solves everything.
Let's go!
I'm sorry, honey.
Your mom was so hardworking.
We barely saw each other at home.
Maybe she's just shocked by me showing up so suddenly.
Could be.
Keep your spirit up. Stay in New York, okay?
-Peace be upon you. -Upon you too.
-What? -What is it?
Look!
-The sticker. -I see.
-You belong here. -You belong here.
I only have enough money for two weeks.
Geez, this is New York.
Money is easy to find. You can hustle and work anywhere you want.
Don't worry.
We take care of each other here.
My stomach's rumbling.
The food!
Ali, not now.
Dad is gone, Mom.
Heart attack. Three months ago.
Where do you live now?
Queens.
What's your number here?
Wait, I don't remember.
Text me, okay?
I'll wait.
-Get to work! -Okay.
Well, that's life.
It's unpredictable. Be ready for twists and turns.
Be patient and always live in the present.
If it's predictable, then it's like a roller-coaster, right?
Not funny, I guess.
Life chooses its own path.
Like me. If I did not break up with Richard…
Your ex-husband?
Nope. That's Ricky. This is Richard. He was my 18th boyfriend.
I kept him strictly for the sex. It was glorious!
Suddenly he met another woman. I was devastated.
But if we were still together, I wouldn't be living with my best friends.
Honey! Don't grab his furry back like that.
Stroke it and follow the movement of the chakra.
When I first arrived in the US,
I was scammed by my agent.
He gave me hundred-dollar bills.
Only the top and bottom are hundreds!
-And the rest? -They're all one-dollar bills!
I was questioned at JFK's immigration room!
It's crazy.
You rock, Auntie.
Bravery is important, Ali. But don't be reckless like me.
What do you mean?
What is your problem?
Take the picture, Ali!
Let me see.
I got it!
ARE YOU FREE THIS SATURDAY?
WANT TO MEET AT THE COFFEE SHOP NEAR MY HOUSE? MOM.
You must try this on!
Ta-da!
Look at this.
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be at work.
You knew each other?
No, I'm not…
How come?
Help Ali find something nice to wear.
Stop holding hands!
This is all your fault, Biyah!
…must have asked lontong to the aunties to not talk about me.
Asked for what?
Lontong?
Well, Tolong, wear this.
Wow!
Good.
Back to work, dear? Stay safe, okay?
You got her number, right?
I didn't even know her name.
-No! -What's wrong with you?
No phone number!
My name is Eva.
Why is my daughter such a flirt?
What are you doing?
What should I talk about with my mom tomorrow?
Tell her you miss her.
That will melt the heart of every mother in the world.
How many siblings do you have at home?
I'm an only child.
But I have a lot of cousins.
Lots of girlfriends, too, I suppose.
Nope. Never.
Such a liar.
You're cute.
I know.
Just kidding.
Your drawing is getting better.
Sorry, I had to take Lisa to the gym.
My husband had some urgent matters.
How old is Lisa?
Have you been sightseeing?
Nope.
How come?
I'm not here for a vacation.
Thank you.
How do you like New York so far?
It's okay.
Where in Queens do you live?
Your old place. With Auntie Party.
Party.
Wow.
It's explosive in the house.
We also have Auntie Chinta, Biyah and Ance.
Yeah.
It's definitely not quiet, unlike Jakarta.
How about you, Mom?
Did you move from Queens to your current home?
I'm glad I moved away from Queens.
It was very difficult time for me when your father asked for a divorce.
I couldn't even get out of bed.
Why didn't you come home?
Don't answer that, Mom.
Is Times Square always that crowded?
-Yes. -Gives me a headache.
This is where you sang?
Uh…
No. I was once a waitress here. And in many other bars.
What about your dream?
What do you mean?
That's it?
Yes. That's it.
You owe me a better explanation.
I mean, you can't discard me, Dad, and now your dream just like that.
Ali!
Ali!
Ali, wait!
But I wanted you to come and live with me.
-But Dad refused, right? -You think?
He never understood me.
He could never accept me.
What about now?
You can go home.
-Visit his grave, then come live with me. -I have a family here.
What about me?
Am I not your family?
You are.
So?
I can't repeat the same mistake again.
Do they even know about me?
I want them to know I exist. You owe me that.
I'll stay here to get close to you.
Your family will accept me and everything will be all right.
-Ali-- -Please, Mom.
I promise I won't be a nuisance.
I'll make you proud.
I'll continue your dream and be successful in New York.
Hello?
-Hi, Auntie. -Ali…
Are you trying to embarrass our family?
When you post a photo of her,
do you even consider our feelings?
Did you consider my feelings when you lied to me?
Fine. I'm sorry.
I'm doing fine.
I found her and we're on good terms. I'll survive in New York.
Nobody ever gave me this choice before.
We just want you to be happy.
We don't want you to be ashamed.
I'm not ashamed of her!
I'm not a disgrace! I never wanted this to be a burden to you.
But if you're unwilling to accept us, we won't be part of your family anymore.
Ali?
Go on!
Go on!
There you go, Sir.
Let's take a picture.
Ali.
I don't want him.
Ali, come here.
Move. Stand there. Come on.
Quee-- What's taking him so long?`
That's enough!
Can I see?
Can I take you out?
Discover the city?
Open mic? You performing?
Wow. You're a singer-songwriter?
Do I need your mom's permission?
And you never asked?
Wait for me!
Can you hold it lower?
-Hi. -Hi.
Here's a song for you.
Who says there's no rice crackers In New York?
You can even find tempeh and tofu
Move! It's done already!
What is it?
Smells amazing!
Smells amazing!
Eva! You're not allowed.
You're still underage, hon.
Listen to her!
It's just for us old hags.
Delicious.
Don't touch! We're still waiting for a guest to arrive.
Thanks for cooking Indonesian food for me.
I was craving it!
Look! Turkey rendang!
Come on. Hurry!
Looks yummy! Let's take a picture together.
Hi, Mom.
Mia! How are you? My God. Thank you. Come in.
Come in.
-You can hang your coat there. -Oh, yeah.
How long has it been?
I almost didn't recognize you.
You look great.
Thanks.
Boomerang.
Queens?
This is Mia.
Let me introduce you, Mom.
Mom, this is Auntie Chinta.
Chinta… Maju Jayawati.
This is Auntie Ance.
Ance, my daughter.
-Hi. I'm Eva. -Hi.
-Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.
And this is Auntie Biyah.
I'm eating. My hand's dirty.
Where is my phone?
-I'll wash my hands. -Okay.
Nothing much has changed with the place.
Wow. Party, this is delicious.
I'm glad you like it.
The dish is a special request from Ali.
Dad told me that your favorite food is rendang.
Can I order it from you sometime?
It's already sold out!
Of course you can.
Just let me know a few days in advance.
What's the best way to stew a rendang?
Because I've tried organic spices from Indonesia,
but I could never get it as fragrant.
You don't need no organic spices.
But you need some love when cooking it. Use a lot of heart,
care and loyalty.
I forgot to ask.
How's your husband?
What does he do?
He's fine. He's a contractor.
Family is always so complicated.
It's hot in here, Ali.
I'm sorry, mom. The heater is broken. We can't turn it off.
Time for dessert.
Yes!
Let's go to the rooftop for some air.
Someone is getting too hot.
Really hot.
Ali.
Once I become a citizen…
I'll work at JFK as an immigration officer.
Why?
I feel so bad for you, Ali.
Just be patient, okay?
I'm okay.
Go.
-Why are you crying all of a sudden? -I feel bad for him.
Just enjoy it. Don't resist it.
Nobody ever told you to come to New York
Who wants you in New York?
I'm sorry, Mom. They're never usually this wild.
Ali, my boyfriends are never faithful to me.
Not even my ex-husband.
But you, you're so faithful to your mother.
It's okay.
Go.
Li.
Everyone say amen!
Amen!
Let's pray that the restaurant will be a huge success.
-Amen. -Amen.
Then we all can retire in Java.
-Amen. -Amen.
So I can visit my mother's grave.
Don't cry, babe!
-Don't cry. -It's okay.
Ali, I have to go.
-Where are you going? -I have to go.
-It's okay, Ali. -I want to go home too.
But I won't stay long and I'll return here.
Because I can't live without all of you.
Let's hug.
Of course you can't!
You depend on us!
Ali, don't you dare mess around with my daughter.
She's the only one I have left in my life.
If you dare to even--
Such a weird class.
Party.
Mia.
You didn't have to come all the way here just to order some rendang.
-What's the name of the restaurant? -"Queens of Queens."
Ali's going to paint a mural on that wall.
I see.
So, what's up?
I need your help.
Sure. Tell me.
My family and I are in a difficult situation.
Okay.
I need you to tell Ali…
to go back to Indonesia.
What?
He has to go home. To his family.
Mia, Ali came all the way here just to--
Here's a check. This one is to pay for his ticket,
another one is for…
We have to take care of each other.
No way!
You can't do this to Ali.
I can't give him what he wants.
And if my husband finds out about him, I'm done.
This is what makes sense to me.
No! You go and tell him yourself!
What did she do to you?
What happened?
Are you okay?
Mom would never do this.
Ali…
We won't take her money.
You should…
take the money,
and live comfortably in Indonesia.
This must be really painful.
But what else can you do?
You just…
have to keep going.
How much did she pay you?
What did you tell her about me?
Take a deep breath, Ali.
Being resentful won't do you any good.
Ali.
All you want is my money!
You've all been vultures from the moment I arrived!
How dare you, Ali!
Nobody ever cared about me!
Hey!
How dare you say these things to my family!
You call this a family?
You're all just jealous.
Because my mom has made it, and you're just a bunch of losers!
Shut your mouth, Ali!
Ance!
I'll prove you all wrong!
Ali?
-What! Stop it. -I want to live with you.
-What's the big deal? -Be quiet!
What's wrong with you?
-Why did you write the check? -Stop pulling my hands!
Please, Mom!
Mom.
What is it that I'm lacking, Mom?
-Go home! -Why?
Why?
Why?
Do you have any idea what I've gone through?
I had to watch Dad being completely broken every day.
I found his dead body on the kitchen floor.
Where were you?
You should've been there, with me. But where were you?
If you wish I didn't exist, just say it to my face.
Just say it!
I abandoned you!
I abandoned you!
Take care, mom.
Ali?
I'm…
Thank you for letting me stay over.
I'll find a new place tomorrow.
Let's eat!
-Try it. -Just a bit.
Just eat it.
To all the parents who have a child
Please help, I'm ashamed
Can I come in?
Ali?
I want to show you something.
Fine.
What does he want?
I have no idea.
But let's give him a chance.
Let's go, Bi.
Let's hear him out.
Let's give him a chance.
Let's just hear him out.
Mom…
All this time I thought I was miserable.
I thought you were the answer to my happiness.
That's why I came here all the way from Indonesia.
To New York.
The city that you love more than me.
This city has a lot of one-way streets.
It made me believe that I must be right.
You're the only way to my happiness.
Hello. We're in New York.
But trying to understand you more makes me forgive you.
I understand why you fell in love with this place.
Even though New York has a lot of one-way streets…
…it also provides many ways for us to be ourselves.
We're very lucky, Mom…
because we finally have the chance to really love.
You're lucky to find your new family.
I'm lucky too. Because of this home.
This home accepts everyone without judgment.
This house shelters everyone's dreams with optimism.
Because no one is perfect, and neither are dreams.
But the journey itself is what matters…
as long as we learn to embrace it.
And I'm so lucky to be a part of this home.
At least, I'm lucky to be given the chance.
Mom, there are many ways to be accepted.
Many ways to be disappointed.
Many ways for us to be a family.
Many ways to love,
and to embrace oneself completely.
I'm sorry for what I did.
If you'll allow me, I promise I will become a better person.
So, can I still live here?
The rent has gone up, Ali.
Go ahead and buy a ticket, so you can kiss and hug.
Go on, before I change my mind.
One,
two…
So many troubles in his life.
