No, I tagged you last. -Wanna go fishing? -There's no fish. They're frozen.
-Wanna go fishing? -There's no fish. They're frozen. -No, they don't freeze. -What do they do? Just die?
-No, they don't freeze. -What do they do? Just die? No. Hey, look at this car.
No. Hey, look at this car.
-Isn't that neat? It's a Ford. -It's not a Ford.
-Isn't that neat? It's a Ford. -It's not a Ford. Yeah, it is. Then what is it?
I don't know, but it's not a Ford. I've been in one.
-Hey, Leonard, what are you doing? -What's it look like?
Somebody might be coming. Keep a lookout, James.
-No one's here. -No one's coming. My turn's next.
What's wrong, Leonard?
Leonard, honey.
-What? -Better get dressed.
Your breakfast is just about ready.
-Come on. We're gonna be late. -Hi, Albert. James.
-Come on. We're gonna be late. -Hi, Albert. James. Hurry up.
We're going to begin today with a history test.
Keep your eyes on your own papers and at the recess bell...
Keep your eyes on your own papers and at the recess bell... ...bring your composition books up to my desk.
-So, what are we gonna do today? -I don't know.
Oh, hello, boys. Hi, Mrs. Lowe. Can Leonard come and play today?
Hi, Mrs. Lowe. Can Leonard come and play today? -Oh, no, I'm sorry. Better not today. -Well, how about tomorrow?
-Oh, no, I'm sorry. Better not today. -Well, how about tomorrow? I'm afraid he won't be well by then either.
-When will he be well? -I don't know.
Thanks for coming by.
Good morning, Bainbridge Hospital, may I help you?
One moment, please.
-Excuse me-- -You gotta ask her.
Good morning, Bainbridge Hospital, may I help you?
Oh, Dr. Horowitz, can you hold the line?
Bainbridge Hospital, can I help you?
Yes. Dr. Franklin and Dr. Tyler are in a board meeting.
Can I take a message, or would you like--? Bye.
Yes?
Yes, I'm Dr. Malcolm Sayer. I have an appointment.
Take a seat, please.
Bainbridge Hospital, may I help you? Thank you. Bainbridge Hospital, may I help you?
Thank you. Bainbridge Hospital, may I help you?
I can connect you to the cafeteria but they will have to page him.
Thank you. Bainbridge Hospital, may I help you?
Dr. Franklin and Dr. Tyler are in the boardroom.
I can take messages, or you can call back in about 45 minutes.
When you say "people," you mean living people?
Well, I'm here to apply for a research position... ...in your neurology lab.
Neurology lab?
We have an x-ray room.
This is a chronic hospital, doctor. The position is for staff neurologist.
You will be working with patients, people. Yes.
-A "doctor" doctor. -Doctor.
Carmel Institute? Tell me about that. Anything with patients there?
-Earthworms. -I'm sorry?
It was an immense project.
I was to extract one decagram of myelin from 4 tons of earthworms.
-Really? -Yes.
I was on that project for five years.
I was the only one who believed in it. Everyone said it couldn't be done.
-It can't. -I know that now. I proved it.
Maybe before, at St. Thomas?
-All research? -Oh, yes.
-This isn't going to work. -Ben, we're understaffed.
He's never worked with human beings.
His research talents would be wasted here. -If it wasn't a state law.... -Excuse me.
-If it wasn't a state law.... -Excuse me.
You're clearly looking for someone with more of a clinical background.
As much as I need a job, there must be applicants suitable for this position.
-Thank you, anyway. -Dr. Sayer, back in medical school.
You couldn't have graduated without some clinical experience.
You took a pulse, you took a temperature. You did diagnosis.
Well, there you have it then.
You do want the job, don't you?
Hey, it's this way, doc.
You spend much time at chronic hospitals? I....
-You'd remember. -Guess not then.
Hey, Christina.
You see, doc, we got MS, Tourette syndrome... ...Parkinson's disease.
Some of them, we ain't even got a name for.
How are you?
-What are all these people waiting for? -Nothing.
-How do they get well? -They don't, they're chronic.
-How do they get well? -They don't, they're chronic. -We call this place the Garden. -Why?
Because all we do is feed and water them.
Thanks, man.
Mr. Kean, I would like to ask--
I was born in 1911 in Kingsbridge, New York.
I came here in July 1955.
Prior to July 1955, I resided at the Brooklyn Psychiatric Center... ...Brooklyn, New York. Prior to that, I was a person.
...Brooklyn, New York. Prior to that, I was a person.
Gets easier.
You don't think it will, but it does.
Oh, no, Buttercup. Oh, good.
No, go to your house. Go. Go.
Go home.
Good.
Good morning, doctor.
I have a new arrival for you.
She was brought in late last night. Here's her file.
Hello. I'm Dr. Sayer.
Do you know where you are?
Can you hear me?
"Diagnosis."
"Medical insurance."
Oh, God.
Her name is Lucy Fishman.
She was found with her sister several days after her sister died.
She has no other living relatives...
...and they say she has always been as she is now... ...with no response or comprehension.
And yet....
A reflex.
If she batted it away, I might call it a reflex. But she didn't. She caught it.
It's still a reflex, doctor.
If you were right, I would agree with you.
It's as if, having lost all will of her own to act... ...she borrows the will of the ball.
The will of the ball? Excuse me.
This is ridiculous.
Trying to make a good impression, right?
A good impression. That's it, isn't it?
You're still settling in.
Miss Costello, will you see to it that Dr. Sayer's patients...
Miss Costello, will you see to it that Dr. Sayer's patients... -...are rescheduled for tomorrow. -Yes, sir.
-...are rescheduled for tomorrow. -Yes, sir.
Borrows the will of the ball.
That's great.
-Okay. Thanks. Thank you. -Okay.
Let us know if she catches anything else.
I'll be fired. It's all right. I'll go back to school.
-Did I forget something? -No.
I just wanted to say to you I preferred your explanation...
...and that I'll look after things for you until you've settled in.
Good night, doctor.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
-Hello. -Hi.
-I'm Dr. Sayer. -I'm Waheedah.
-Waheedah. How are you today? -I'm fine, thank you.
Yes. Oh, sorry. What form?
Yes, I'll hold.
Okay. Three, two.
Oh, thank you.
Bye.
Hello.
We made it, Orville. We're in orbit.
Oh, goody. Now we can try being weightless.
Let's celebrate with delicious Nestlé's Quik.
Nothing makes chocolatey milk like Quik, you know?
That Nestlé's chocolate flavor is out of this world.
Out of this world.
Hello, up there. Time to recharge with delicious Nestlé's Quik.
Lucy.
You're out of the hole.
-Could...? -Anthony. Anthony.
Could you help me move this?
Excuse me.
Lucy, you're almost there. Come on.
Here's the water, Lucy.
Here it is, Lucy.
The water is....
It must be all that Jell-O they give you.
Jell-O, Jell-O. Day after day.
Red Jell-O, yellow Jell-O. Every day, Jell-O.
Hurry up. You don't wanna miss the laundry truck.
I forgot to tell you, Mrs. Cooper passed away. Remember her? She was nice.
Remember her? She was nice. Always a kind word. Her dog I could have done without.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Does he ever speak to you?
Of course not. Not in words.
He speaks to you in other ways?
How do you mean?
You don't have children. No.
If you did, you would know.
This is "atypical schizophrenia."
"Atypical hysteria," this one.
"Atypical nerve impairment."
"No change since last examination."
"No change or therapy recommended."
That's very nice.
This one is "no change," dated 9-11-44.
Sorry.
That's 25 years.
You'd think all these atypical somethings...
You'd think all these atypical somethings... ...would amount to a typical something.
But a typical what?
-Doctor? -Yes?
Wanna go for a cup of coffee somewhere or something?
Tea?
Oh, normally, I would say yes.
I made other plans.
Right, right, right.
-Well, some other time. All right. -Oh, yes.
-I'm over here. Good night. -I'm right there. Night.
"Encephalitis lethargica."
Where is it? Where is it?
"Encephalitis lethargica."
Sorry. I thought someone left the lights on.
I found it. I found the connection.
They all survived encephalitis. Years before they came here. See? In the 1920s.
Years before they came here. See? In the 1920s. -That's very nice. Yes. -Isn't it wonderful?
-That's very nice. Yes. -Isn't it wonderful?
-I'll come back later. -Please.
How many have you found there?
Five, and I believe there are more.
How are they?
Just as you described them back then, "insubstantial as ghosts."
Only I guess many of them were children then.
Yes. Children who fell asleep.
Most died during the acute stage of the illness.
Those who survived, who awoke... ...seemed fine, as though nothing had happened.
We just didn't realize... ...how much the infection had damaged the brain.
Years went by, five, 10, 15...
...before these strange neurological symptoms would appear.
But they did.
I began to see them in the early 1930s.
Old people brought in by their children.
Young people brought in by their parents.
They could no longer dress themselves... ...or feed themselves.
They could no longer speak in most cases.
Some families went mad.
People who were normal were now...
...elsewhere.
What's it like to be them?
What are they thinking?
They're not.
The virus didn't spare their higher faculties.
-We know that for a fact? -Yes.
Because? Because the alternative is unthinkable.
I'm all for fixing this place up, but what are we doing?
I have a hunch.
-Excuse me. Sorry. -Excuse me. Sorry.
What's stopping Lucy from crossing to the fountain?
-Nothing. -Exactly.
The visual field just stops. There's a void. There's no pattern. No visual rhythm.
There's a void. There's no pattern. No visual rhythm. Nothing to compel her to keep going.
-So we're making something. -Exactly.
All right, Lucy.
She's looking out the....
Where's that article? Where is it?
This the right issue?
This is last year's. I can't find it.
-I'd like to know more about your son. -Certainly.
Something was wrong, they said, with his hands.
He couldn't write anymore.
He couldn't do the work.
I should take him out of school, they said.
He was 11.
Slowly, he got worse.
He'd call me and I'd come in. And he'd be sitting at his desk in a trance.
One hour, two hours.
Then he'd be okay again.
One day I came home from work, found him in his bed.
He kept saying, "Mom. Mom."
His arm like this...reaching.
"What do you want, Leonard?"
He never spoke again. It was like he disappeared.
Later that year, I took him to Bainbridge.
It was November 14th, 1939.
He was 20 years old.
What did he do for those nine years he was in this room, Mrs. Lowe?
He read.
He loved to read. He read all the time.
Really?
Well, that's all he could do.
That's enough.
Leonard.
All right, Leonard, we're finished.
Nothing, nothing, nothing and nothing.
-Don't tell me. It's one of your statues. -Exactly.
How did I guess that? Pass the salt, will you?
But what about this?
What do you mean, "this"? It's a strobe.
You're wrong.
All of this before is the strobe. This is me saying his name to him.
Excuse me.
What does that mean?
-Hey! -Sorry.
Down the middle. Hum it in there. Hum it in there.
Home run. Home run.
I can catch a ball.
Hey, doc, throw me the ball.
Throw me the ball. Throw me the ball.
-Get back. -Hey, I can catch a ball.
-Doc. Hey. -I said, get back.
-Is this all of them? -Yes.
Bring them in here with the others.
I should have given David his divorce.
I just thought he really would want to be a father to his son.
Excuse me.
The patients have been given their morning medication.
That's good.
Dr. Sayer was hoping you'd have some free time. Wanna come with me?
-Beth? -Yeah.
One of the most beautiful arias ever written.
Watch them closely for any reactions.
"Call me Ishmael.
Years ago, never mind how long precisely...
...having little or no money... ...and nothing particular to interest me on shore"....
Leonard, I know you can hear me.
I want you to try and respond when I speak your name.
See, it's not just any music.
It has to be the music that's right for them.
It's like they're only moved by music that moves them.
I haven't found anything that moves Bert yet.
They'll sit like that all day if I let them. I have to play the first card.
L.
Leonard.
L.
This is Frank.
If you could just me help me get him to his feet.
There's something else that reaches him.
-What? -Human contact.
If you could just stand over there for a minute.
He can't walk without me. If I let go of him, he'll fall.
I'm not gonna let you fall.
But... ...he'll walk with me anywhere.
It's like the ball, only it's my will he's borrowing.
The will of another human being.
I'll begin by moving the pointer to L, for Leonard.
When you begin to move the pointer, I'll stop and you take over.
Do you understand?
All right. I'm beginning.
Very good.
No, maybe I didn't make myself clear. My fault. I....
L. Oh, good, good.
Now the E.
K.
Dyslexia.
E. Good, good.
S.
P.
You're spelling something else.
Rilke.
His gaze From staring through the bars
Has grown so weary That it can take in nothing more
For him, it is as though There were a thousand bars
And behind the thousand bars No world
As he paces in cramped circles Over and over
His powerful strides Are like a ritual dance Around a center Where a great will stands paralyzed
Around a center Where a great will stands paralyzed
At times, the curtains of the eye Lift without a sound
And a shape enters
Slips through the tightened silence Of the shoulders
Reaches the heart, and dies
Have you heard of the drug L-dopa? -What? -It's a synthetic dopamine.
-What? -It's a synthetic dopamine. Oh, yes, I did. For Parkinson's patients, yeah. Why?
Oh, yes, I did. For Parkinson's patients, yeah. Why? Nothing.
Sign the petition now. Thousands of young men...
-...are dying every day. -Sorry.
Help us get out of this illegal war. Sign up now.
A hundred years would pass... ...before modern neuropathology would even allow us...
...before modern neuropathology would even allow us... ...to actually locate the damage in the Parkinsonian brain.
Yes.
With our development of the drug L-dopa...
...we can, for the first time... ...promise the Parkinsonian patient a more normal life.
By administering L--
Thank you. Yes.
I'm very curious about this drug...
...and I wonder if you've come across anyone who might have--
Excuse me, doctor...?
Sayer. I'm curious if you've come across any patients with encephalitis?
After I'm through, Dr. Sayer. If you wouldn't mind.
-Excuse me. -Well, as I was saying...
-Excuse me. -Well, as I was saying... ...by administering L-dopa....
Do you think a Parkinsonian tremor taken to its extreme...
...would appear as no tremor at all?
-Are you talking to me? -Oh, yes.
Imagine you accelerated a Parkinsonian hand tremor...
...to the point of immobility in the....
Suppose there's a patient... ...with Parkinsonian compulsions accelerated:
The hand tremor, the head bobbing, ticking, quickening of speech.
Might they not all cave in on themselves... ...and, in effect, turn a person into stone?
I don't know. Maybe.
Well, do you think L-dopa would help the situation?
Dr. Sayers, right?
I'm just a chemist, doctor. You're the physician.
I'll leave it to you to do the damage.
You know, Freud believed in miracles, prescribing cocaine like candy.
We all believed in cortisone...
...till our patients went psychotic on it.
And now it's L-dopa?
With all due respect, it's rather too soon to say that.
Well, with all due respect... ...I think it's rather way too soon to say that.
Let the chemists do the damage, doctor.
But I....
-Dr. Kaufman? -Yeah.
Did you read this case?
"New drug lets shaking palsy patients eat Jell-O."
Yes, I read them, doctor. I read them all. Dutifully, soberly.
All 30 cases had Parkinson's. Mild Parkinson's.
Your Parkies, if that's what they are... ...haven't moved in decades.
Look at it again, sir.
Now, you know better than to make a leap like that.
You want there to be a connection. That doesn't mean there is one.
What I believe, what I know, is these people are alive inside.
How do you know that, doctor? Because they catch tennis balls?
I know it.
How many did you think I'd let you put on it?
All of them.
Some. One.
One. With the family's consent, signed.
Leonard has Parkinson's disease?
No.
Well, his symptoms are like Parkinson's...
...but then again, they're not.
Then what will this medicine do for him?
I don't know what it will do for him, if anything at all.
What do you think it'll do?
I'm not sure, because it was designed for a totally different disorder.
What do you hope it'll do?
I hope it'll bring him back from wherever he is.
To what?
To the world.
What's there here for him after all these years?
You.
You're here.
All of it, please.
At 200 milligrams, he showed no response.
The acid in the juice neutralized it.
-Maybe he needs more. -Maybe he needs less.
I'll try it in milk.
Five hundred milligrams.
I'll call if there's any change.
Yes.
It's swung on. A high fly ball. Thank you.
-Night, Sara. -Good night.
It's quiet.
It's late.
Everyone's asleep.
I'm not asleep.
No. You're awake.
May I?
Me.
Leonard.
There's someone here to see you.
Ma. Ma.
Mom.
Oh, my baby.
My name is Eleanor.
Eleanor.
-It's a pleasure to meet you. -It's a pleasure to meet you.
-Ladies? Please. -Oh, now what did I do?
Oh, my goodness.
How do you do, sir?
My name is Margaret.
Margaret.
-Beth. -Beth.
Anthony.
Anthony, how are you?
Great, man. How are you?
Great too.
All right, man.
-You meet him? -Didn't he look good?
-You meet him? -Didn't he look good? Yeah.
-Don't eat so fast. -He's doing fine.
I mean, he's starving, right? He was starving.
I don't think I could deal with losing 30 years of my life.
I can't even imagine it.
-Come on, try something else. -He does realize it, doesn't he?
Now, Leonard, turn this way, please.
It's a camera called a Polaroid.
Thank you.
Takes a picture in less than a minute.
Amazing.
Now, if you could try this.
Splendid, that's wonderful.
I'd like you to walk now to the end of the room.
Good. Ready?
Go.
Very good.
Very good.
And back now.
That was very quick, really. Let me get some more film.
You have to at least lay down.
You need the rest.
I'm afraid to close my eyes.
-If I close my eyes, I'll-- -You'll sleep.
When you wake up in the morning, it'll be the next morning.
I promise.
What a wonderful place the Bronx has become.
-That's my school. -Really?
-Is that classical? -You pick any type of music you want.
-What's that? -It's rock 'n' roll.
-Come on in. -No, no. Come back in. Something happened while you've been away.
Come back in. Something happened while you've been away.
Pollution. I don't think this is wise.
Leonard, that's not wading, that's swimming. Come on, Leonard.
Leonard, I don't know if the hospital is covered for this.
Leonard.
-Come on. -No, no. Not--
Come on in.
Leonard, the tide's coming in.
That's the periodic table of elements.
I can date my introduction to science by that.
It's wonderful, really. It's....
It's the universe at its essence.
You see, you have your alkaline metals. You have your halogens, your inert gases.
Every element has its place in that order. You can't change that.
They're secure, no matter what.
You're not married?
Me?
No.
I'm not very good with people.
I never have been, Leonard.
I like them.
I wish I could say I had more than a rudimentary understanding of them.
Maybe if they were less unpredictable.
Eleanor would disagree with you.
-Eleanor? -Miss Costello.
Oh, of course.
She's spoken to you about me?
What did she say?
That you are a kind man. That you care very much for people.
I'd like to put the rest of the group on the drug.
I realize this may be somewhat expensive.
When you say expensive, you have any idea how much money?
Yes, I talked to Ray. I have an estimate....
Thank you. The pharmacist says...
Thank you. The pharmacist says... ...to put the others on the same dosage as Mr. Lowe would be 12,000.
...to put the others on the same dosage as Mr. Lowe would be 12,000.
-How much? -$12,000.
-A month? -Yes.
I can't go before the board with that, doctor.
I was thinking of speaking directly to the patrons.
The few patrons this hospital has already give what they can.
We'll convince them to give more than they're accustomed to.
-Perhaps if they see Mr. Lowe. -I think you overestimate the effect...
-Perhaps if they see Mr. Lowe. -I think you overestimate the effect... ...that Mr. Lowe has on people, doctor. We're talking about money.
...that Mr. Lowe has on people, doctor. We're talking about money.
There was an extreme rigidity of the axial musculature.
A gross impairment of the postural reflexes. An autonomic dysfunction. It is a brain stem type of rigidity.
An autonomic dysfunction. It is a brain stem type of rigidity.
A meningismus.
What's most striking is the profound facial masking... ...or deafferentation, which we now know...
...or deafferentation, which we now know... ...should not to be confused with apathy or catatonia.
Some things could reach him, though.
The mention of his name, notes of a particular piece of music.
Or the touch of another human being.
But awakenings were rare and transient... ...lasting only a moment or two.
The rest of the time, he remained in a metaphorical...
The rest of the time, he remained in a metaphorical... ...if not physiological, equivalent of sleep, or even death.
This was his condition when found by me in a remote bay of this hospital...
...and the quality of his life for the last 30 years.
-Now? -Whenever you're ready.
My name is Leonard Lowe.
It has been explained to me that I have been away for quite some time.
I'm back.
Okay, here we go.
-Take her away. -Okay.
-Thank you very much. -Sure.
Dr. Sayer.
-What is it? -A fucking miracle.
-Where are my glasses? -On your face.
Thank you.
Beth, close the door.
I'm talking.
Light.
I'm loose.
I'm scared.
Hello?
-Where is this? -Don't worry.
I'm walking.
Who are you?
Thank you for coming. Things are different. -Miriam. -Miriam.
-Miriam. -Miriam. -Miriam. -Good morning.
Lucy.
I had the strangest dream.
I have to take your blood pressure.
I've been sitting for 25 years, you missed your chance.
Are you okay?
I need some makeup.
I think we can take care of that.
And I need some dye for my hair. Black.
Black? Rose, are you sure? Yes. It's always been black.
Dr. Sayer, something about fruit trees.
Prune the fruit trees.
I will.
I want a steak, rare. Mashed potatoes and gravy. String beans.
I was aware of things, but nothing meant anything to me. There was no connection to me.
There was no connection to me. There was a war or two.
This morning, I went to the bathroom all by myself.
Do it, do it, do it.
I liked them better the other way.
-Protesters marched from a meeting.... -Where did they go?
Rolando, can you speak to me?
It's Miss Costello.
Do you understand me?
Lucy...
...what year is it?
What year is it?
It's '26, silly.
Miriam. Come on, Miriam, be a sport.
-It will only take a second. -Don't touch. -Miriam. -Don't.
Oh, jeez, I'm getting tired of this.
Come on, Miriam.
I'm convinced. I really am.
"Like crowds storming the Bastille...
...the mighty Mets stormed their locker room shortly after 9:00... ...on their night to remember...
...and touched off one of the loudest, wildest...
...and touched off one of the loudest, wildest... ...wettest victory celebrations in baseball history.
Released from bondage and ridicule after seven destitute seasons...

Sidney.
Hi, Sidney.
Hi.
Are we gonna go to the same place? -I don't know. -Stay together.
-Stop. Pay attention. -Stay together. Bring up the back.
Everybody stay together, come on. -Bye. Bye. -Here.
-Bring Leonard. -Anthony, get Leonard. It's all right.
Wait. Leonard. Len.
Len, come on, come on, come on.
-Everyone, please stay with the group. -Hurry up.
-Come on now. -Stay together.
Okay, everybody get in. Back here.
-Okay, no pushing, no pushing. -Just hop.
Hey, doctor, I wanted to ask you... -...how my father is. -The same.
-Try and make room. -Ma, maybe you shouldn't go.
Oh, no. Of course I wanna go. Don't be ridiculous.
-I'm gonna take the stairs. -It's crowded. We'll go another time.
You can't be there, Leonard, or the door won't close. Thank you.
You can't be there, Leonard, or the door won't close. Thank you. Bert, stop jumping!
-Sidney's going. -He's a patient, Mom.
-He's not the same kind of patient. -But he's still a patient, you're not.
-He's not the same kind of patient. -But he's still a patient, you're not. I'm your mother.
Are there any other mothers going?
Wait a minute. Now, what have you done to your hair?
-Yes, Bert. That's a tire. -I know it's a tire, I'm not an idiot.
There's your bus, Ma. There, go.
Have fun.
-They treat me like an asshole. -We'll take care of that.
-Bye-bye. -Come on.
-You ready, Leonard? -I decided not to go. I'm gonna stay.
-Why? What's wrong? -I'm okay, just.... Bye, Leonard.
Wave.
Doctor, come on already. I'm-- All right. Leonard, are you sure? Are you all right?
I'm-- All right. Leonard, are you sure? Are you all right?
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'll see you later. Have a good time. -We-- -Come on.
-Have a good time. -I'm coming.
-Bert. -Bye, you guys. Have a good time.
-Bye-bye -Bert, sit down.
-Fish sticks, please. -Okay.
-Got those french fries. -Okay, here you go.
Hi.
Meatloaf, please.
-Here you go. -Thank you.
-Meatloaf. -Meatloaf too.
Thank you.
There you go. Okay?
-Next. -I'd like fish sticks.
Are you following me?
Oh, I'm sorry, I was only kidding.
I saw you upstairs just now.
Are you visiting someone? No.
You work here.
I live here.
You're a patient? That's a dollar 80, baby.
You don't look like a patient.
I don't?
I've always loved Carnegiea, haven't you? Dr. Sayer.
-What is it, Anthony? -Did you choose this place?
Why? I always come here.
Why? I mean, don't get me wrong, doc.
This is a nice place. But after the first hour, it loses something.
Anthony seems to think the group is bored.
They are.
I thought about taking them to the opera house.
The opera?
-The Museum of Natural History-- -Oh, no, no. I don't think so.
Just a lot of dead stuffed things. You know:
Where else is there?
-Is it legal again? -Yes, for some time.
-Ladies, what can I get you? -Well....
-A Rob Roy on the rocks. -A what?
Could you make that a virgin Rob Roy?
I work the night shifts at this diner.
So sometimes before work, I'll come see my father.
He used to go to all the games... ...so I like to read him the sports pages.
I don't even know if he knows I visit him or not.
My mother doesn't think so.
But you do.
Well, sometimes I think I see something.
You know, I think I see a change.
And for a moment, I see him like he was. You know, before the stroke.
And then it's gone.
I don't even know if I saw anything.
Does that make any sense? Yeah. Yes.
Okay, my troop, back to the ward.
Come on. Danny.
Bill, Deon. Come on. Put your fork down. Let's go.
So why are you here?
I receive medication. For what?
Without it, I'm sort of like your father.
But I'm okay now.
That's good.
Please. No. No.
I agree.
Thank you, Rose.
And I was so sure... ...he was over-easy with bacon, wheat toast, black coffee...
...I brought him his food without taking his order.
Know what he says? "You forgot the tomato."
-Did you bring it? -We were out of them.
-Did you bring it? -We were out of them. That's why I didn't get it in the first place.
Visiting hours are from 3 to 6 every day.
Good afternoon. Bainbridge Hospital.
Well...
...it was really nice talking to you. It was nice talking to you too.
-Bye-bye. -Bye.
-Paula? -Yeah?
He knows.
Your father.
He knows you visit him.
See you.
-Can you believe this? -Doctor, these are my friends.
-Hello. -He's my doctor. Isn't he the cat's meow? I wanna show you the sunroom.
Miriam, I don't know how to tell you this so I'm just going to say it.
Your husband....
He was granted a divorce from you in 1953.
Thank God.
Look at that. Pontiac Firebird 400 engine.
-Firebird. -Oh, now, that's a car.
Lucy, may I have your hand?
Take me away from this place.
Rum. Right here.
-I guess I lose. -Well, I guess your luck is changing.
Very nice. Very nice.
-How's it going? -How's it going?
-How's it going? -How's it going? Yeah. How do you feel?
Well, my parents are dead, my wife is in an institution...
...my son has disappeared out West somewhere.
I feel old and I feel swindled.
That's how I feel.
I stopped by the hobby shop. I got more pencils.
And I got this.
A small T-square.
-Good. -Oh, I can use that. Oh, good, okay. Good.
-Let's start a new room. -Hi, Leonard.
Hi.
That's really nice.
I'll be right back.
Leonard.
He never talked about girls before.
He certainly never had anything to do with them.
It's a bit ridiculous, all this girl business.
-Don't you think? -He's a grown man, Mrs. Lowe.
You know what he said to me?
I should take a vacation. I should go away for a few days and relax.
I'm sure he meant you deserve a vacation, which you do.
I can't leave him alone in this place. He'd die without me.
Girls.
-Hello? -Hello?
Dr. Sayer?
Dr. Sayer, I've gotta talk to you.
-Leonard? -Yes. I think it's important--
-Leonard? -Yes. I think it's important-- I think it's important some things were said that--
Well, I just gotta talk to you. What kind of things?
Things that matter, that have happened to me...
...things that I've come to understand. Things.
Where are you calling from, Leonard? Your office.
It's very late. -Is it? -Leonard.
-Is it? -Leonard. -You stay there, I'll be right over. -Good.
Leonard? Leonard?
Dr. Sayer, sit down. Sit down.
Why? What's wrong?
We've got to tell everybody. We've got to remind them.
We've got to tell everybody. We've got to remind them. -Remind them how good it is. -How good what is, Leonard?
-Remind them how good it is. -How good what is, Leonard?
Read the newspaper. What does it say? All bad.
It's all bad.
People have forgotten what life's about. Forgotten what it is to be alive.
They need to be reminded.
Reminded of what they have and what they can lose.
And what I feel is the joy of life, the gift of life, the freedom of life... ...the wonderment of life.
He kept saying that people don't appreciate the simple things.
Work, play, friendship, family. It's--
And he was so excited, he talked till 5:00 in the morning.
I don't know whether this is liberation, mania....
-Or love? -Yes.
What he's saying is right though. We don't really know how to live.
But at 5 in the morning....
Waheedah. How are you?
-I'm fine. -Very good.
-Mr. Lowe? Are you all right? -Yeah.
-What is it that you want now? -The simplest thing.
And that is?
To have the choice to go for a walk if I want to, like any normal person.
You are free to go for a walk.
I am? Alone?
What difference would that make?
Look, I'm not a criminal.
I've committed no crime, I'm not a danger to myself or to others.
And yet, I'm still not allowed to go for a walk on my own by myself.
You didn't wake a thing, you woke a person.
I am a person.
Mr. Lowe, are you at all aware...
...of the unconscious hostility you're exhibiting toward us right now?
How can I be aware if it's unconscious?
Nora, please.
I'm curious. What would you do if you went out?
I'd go for a walk, I'd look at things, I'd talk to people.
Decide if I wanna go in this direction, or that... ...or straight ahead.
I would do all the things that you take for granted.
-And that's it? -That's it.
All right, then, we'll certainly take this into consideration...
All right, then, we'll certainly take this into consideration... ...and we'll let you know.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
Dr. Sayer.
-Are you all right? -I was aware of that.
-Are you all right? -I was aware of that. It was nothing. I was nervous. What did they say?
They said there was insufficient data at this time.
That continued observation was necessary for a complete diagnosis.
They said it's a different world and you may not be prepared for it.
They couldn't be held responsible for what might happen to you.
They said no.
And what did you say?
-They don't have to listen to me. -Did you agree with them?
Yes.
Leonard, I don't think we're out of the woods yet.
I'm not sure that this...is nothing.
It's an experimental drug. We need time to evaluate things before--
-Bye. -Leonard.
Leonard.
Leonard, where are you going?
Leonard, where are you going? For a walk.
Leonard. Leonard.
This is Dr. Sayer.
-Where are you going? -I'm going outside.
No. Patients not allowed beyond this point.
-I'm going for a walk. -I'm sorry.
Please, don't make it hard on yourself.
-I got him. I got him. I got him. -Leonard, stop. -I just wanna go for a walk. -He's not a mental patient.
-I just wanna go for a walk. -He's not a mental patient. This is unnecessary. Let him go. Please, he's not violent.
This is unnecessary. Let him go. Please, he's not violent. He's not violent. He is not a mental patient.
Will you let go? You will hurt him. Will you let go of him?
Will you let go? You will hurt him. Will you let go of him? Will you stop, please? Let go of him.
I don't understand it. He was never any trouble before.
He was quiet and polite and respectful.
He never demanded anything. He was never disobedient.
Because he was catatonic, Mrs. Lowe.
I'm speaking of when he was a boy.
I'm sorry.
I don't know who that is up there.
I don't think he knows.
You've turned Leonard into something he's not.
It's not us that's defective, it's them. We're not in crisis, they are.
-Yeah. -They are.
We've been through the worst and survived. They haven't.
We've been through the worst and survived. They haven't. -They fear it. They fear it. -Right.
-Because they know. -They know. They know.
-They know. -They know.
...because we remind them--
We remind them that there's a problem--
There's a problem that they don't have an answer to.
And they'll never be healers until they realize this... ...until they start to see the problem, until they admit there is a problem.
...until they start to see the problem, until they admit there is a problem. And that the problem isn't us. We're not the problem.
And that the problem isn't us. We're not the problem. It's them. They're the problem.
-It's them. -They're the problem.
They're the problem.
They're the problem!
He's lived 30 years without the ability to release anger.
As have the others.
I think his behavior is more natural than the others.
Oh, really? His tics, his paranoia, these are signs of normal behavior?
-Yeah, because he's in that place. -Is that it?
Yes, we wake him up and then lock him up in a cage.
That's not paranoia, that's a fact.
The fact is, I've got 20 psychotics up there refusing to eat.
Now, they have no idea why they're refusing to eat.
-How long should I let that go on? -He knows why. He wants out.
Dr. Sayer, Mr. Lowe is not the messiah of Ward 5.
He's a man in trouble.
He wasn't resurrected, he was administered a drug by you.
A drug that's fallen short of its miraculous reputation.
The others are fine. They show no signs-- He's been on it longer, doctor.
Now, I sympathize with him, I've tried to accommodate him.
But I will not let him endanger the health of the rest of the patients.
It will help if you wait for me out there.
It will help if you wait for me out there. Thank you.
Excuse me. -Excuse me. -We can't allow it.
-Excuse me. -We can't allow it. He's all right.
He's all right.
How are you today?
I'm all right. How are you?
Never better.
What's the purpose of these gentlemen? Oh, these gentlemen protect me.
-I wish I didn't need them. -Someone's trying to hurt you?
-Who? -Who?
That's the thing, isn't it? Who?
One never knows. Someone I least expect, I expect.
Look at history.
Leonard, every patient on this ward thinks there's a plot against him.
They're mistaken, they're crazy.
You've gotten worse.
The drug's not working.
These things you're experiencing are side effects.
Making you behave this way.
I appreciate you coming to see me, but I have things to do.
Leonard, Leonard, please, look at yourself. No, look at yourself. I have a sickness.
No, look at yourself. I have a sickness.
Sickness took me out of the world, and I fought to come back.
I fought for 30 years, 30 years, and I'm still fighting.
I fought for 30 years, 30 years, and I'm still fighting. -But you have no excuse. -Me?
-But you have no excuse. -Me? -Nothing to do with me. -You have no excuse.
-Nothing to do with me. -You have no excuse.
You're just a scared and lonely man with nothing.
No life, nothing. You're the one that's asleep.
Your medicine could be taken away. They can do that.
You could wake up in the morning and it won't be there.
Leonard.
Get away from me!
I'm all right. Thank you.
I just fell. I'm fine.
Sayer.
Help me.
Can you walk?
I won't let them take the medicine away, Leonard.
We'll work together with it.
All we're saying is you're taking an unnecessary risk.
He's had a reaction to the drug. He has acquired some tics.
But he's not as concerned with his appearance...
...as the affect it may have upon the other patients.
We'll be working with his dosage.
He's aware, and prepared for any effects.
He wants the others to be prepared.
-You've gotta help me with this. -Yes, doctor. Okay.
Hey, Len.
-Welcome back. -Thanks.
-Leonard. -How are you doing?
-Leonard. -How are you doing? -How you feeling? -You all right?
-Gee, it's swell to see you. -What's up, Bert?
-It got so quiet around here. -Because we're waiting for you.
You're looking good, Len. You're looking better every day.
Yeah?
What if he's just had enough of it? What if it's just a matter of time for all of us?
There's no reason to think...
...what's happening to Leonard will happen to you.
Why not?
Well, you're all individuals. And you're well.
-Aren't you? -Yes.
That was lovely, Lucy.
I learned that song a long, long time ago.
I know what year it is.
I just can't imagine being older than 22.
I've no experience at it.
I know it's not 1926.
I just need it to be.
How are you, Leonard?
Never better.
How are the others? Are they talking about me?
They're scared.
Well, they should be.
Can you stop this?
I'm not sure, but I'm trying.
-Don't give up on me. -I won't.
-Four twenty-five, yes. -Four twenty-five. Okay.
Here we go, 425.
I got a postcard from my son.
I'm all right, and then everything stops.
Look at this, I got a postcard from my son.
No warning, it's like a light switch going off.
It happens that fast.
Something has to happen to bring me back. A sound or a touch.
And then I can move again, I'm okay again.
Thanks.
It's not that it feels bad, it's just that it's nothing. I feel nothing, like I'm dead.
I feel nothing, like I'm dead.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Gets to be like I'm not a person anymore. Just a collection of tics.
Not that I mind them necessarily.
Sometimes they make life kind of interesting.
Though I'm not sure who's in control, me or them.
What I do mind is knowing that they shouldn't be there.
Back to 5. Okay. Five. Five.
-Just a little more. Just-- -Okay, all right.
It feels good when I'm working. I feel good here.
-Book list is coming along well. -I'd love to see it.
It's here somewhere.
That's all right, some other time.
Leonard. Leonard.
-What's happening? -You're having an oculogyric crisis.
Get the camera. Get the camera. Get the camera.
I can't do this. I'm turning the camera off.
No, no. Watch, watch, watch. Watch, watch, watch.
Learn, learn, learn.
Learn for me. Learn.
Let's see this....
-Six twenty-five. -All right, 625.
-Six seventy-five, if-- Just-- -Six seventy-five.
-Six seventy-five, if-- Just-- -Six seventy-five. -Okay. -Thank you.
I can't read anymore. I can't keep my eyes in one place.
I keep going back to the beginning, beginning... ...beginning, beginning, beginning....
-I've let everybody down. I have. -No.
-I've let you down. -No, you have not.
-I have, I have. I'm grotesque. -You are not. It's not true.
-I have, I have. I'm grotesque. -You are not. It's not true. -I won't listen to you. -I'm grotesque. Look at me.
-I won't listen to you. -I'm grotesque. Look at me. Look, and tell me I am not. Tell me I'm not.
Look, and tell me I am not. Tell me I'm not. -You're not. -Well, this isn't me.
-You're not. -Well, this isn't me. This is-- This isn't me.
When my son was born healthy, I never asked why.
Why was I so lucky?
What did I do to deserve this perfect child? This perfect life?
But when he got sick... ...you can bet I asked why, I demanded to know why.
...you can bet I asked why, I demanded to know why. Why was this happening?
There was nothing I could do about it. No one I could go to and say:
There was nothing I could do about it. No one I could go to and say: "Stop this. Please, stop this. Can't you see my son is in pain?"
"Stop this. Please, stop this. Can't you see my son is in pain?"
My son is in pain. Please, stop this.
-He's fighting, Mrs. Lowe. -He's losing.
I worked...
...had friends over, went dancing.
That's about it, not much.
That's great, you know.
-I've never done any of those things. -You will.
They'll never let me out of this place.
And they shouldn't.
I am still not well, as you can see.
You know, I feel well when I see you.
I won't see you anymore.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
Look.
-Now? -Whenever you're ready.
My name is Leonard Lowe.
It has been explained to me that I have been away... ...for quite some time.
I'm back.
What's it like to be back?
I thought it was a dream at first.
What made you realize it wasn't a dream?
When I spoke and you understood me.
You told him I was a kind man.
How kind is it to give life... ...only to take it away again?
It's given and taken away from all of us.
Why doesn't that comfort me?
Because you are a kind man.
Because he's your friend.
The summer was extraordinary.
It was a season of rebirth and innocence.
A miracle...
...for 15 patients and for us, their caretakers.
But now we have to adjust to the realities of miracles.
We can hide behind the veil of science and say the drug failed.
Or that the illness itself had returned.
Or the patients were unable to cope with losing decades of their lives.
But the reality is we don't know what went wrong...
But the reality is we don't know what went wrong... ...any more than we know what went right.
What we do know is, as the chemical window closed...
...another awakening took place.
That the human spirit is more powerful than any drug.
And that is what needs to be nourished.
With work, play, friendship, family.
These are the things that matter.
This is what we'd forgotten.
The simplest things.
Well, good night.
Well, good night. Good night.
-Eleanor! -Yes?
Eleanor?
What's wrong?
I was wondering, what are you doing tonight?
If you have other plans, I--
-No, I was-- -Because I was wondering--
-You have no plans? -No, I have no....
Because I was wondering if you-- We-- Well, you and I could....
We-- Well, you and I could....
If we could go for a cup of coffee.
Yes.
I'd love to.
My car is over here.
What do you say we just walk?
Constantinople had fallen.
Moslem Turks swept into Europe with a vast, superior force...
...striking at Romania, threatening all of Christendom.
From Transylvania arose a Romanian knight...
...of the Sacred Order of the Dragon, known as Dracula.
On the eve of the battle...
...his bride, Elisabeta...
...whom he prized above all things on Earth...
...knew that he must face an insurmountable force...
...from which he might never return.
God be praised. I am victorious.
Elisabeta.
The vengeful Turks shot an arrow into the castle...
...carrying false news of Dracula's death.
Elisabeta, believing him dead...
...flung herself into the river.
My prince is dead.
All is lost without him.
May God unite us in heaven.
She has taken her own life.
Her soul cannot be saved.
She is damned.
It is God's law.
Is this my reward for defending God's church?
Is this my reward for defending God's church? Sacrilege! I renounce God!
I shall rise from my own death...
...to avenge hers with all the powers of darkness.
The blood is the life...
...and it shall be mine!
I've done everything that you asked, master.
All the preparations are in order.
Everything.
I await your command.
For I know...
...that when the rewards are given...
...I will be one of those who benefits from your generosity.
Thank you.
Gone mad. Renfield is deranged.
He's lost his greedy mind, poor chap.
I want you to take over for his foreign client...
...this rather eccentric Count Dracula.
-He's buying up property in London. -Of course, sir.
I'll attend to the count. Thank you for your confidence.
This is a great opportunity for you, Harker.
But you'll have to leave for Transylvania immediately.
Opportunities such as this come but once in a lifetime.
Yes, of course, sir.
If I may inquire...
...what, in fact, happened to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?
Nothing. Nothing.
Personal problems.
Close these transactions... ...and your future with this firm is assured.
Yes, sir. I will give it my full attention.
We've waited this long, haven't we?
We can be married when I return.
Of course.
I'll write.
Jonathan.
Jonathan, I love you.
I love you, Mina.
25th May, Budapest.
Left Budapest early this morning.
The impression I had was that we were leaving the west...
...and entering the east.
Jonathan Harker's Journal 25th May The district I am to enter is in the extreme east of the country...
...just on the borders of three states... ...Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina...
...in the midst of the Carpathian Mountains...
...one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe.
"My friend...
...welcome to the Carpathians.
I am anxiously expecting you.
At the Borgo Pass...
...my carriage will await you and bring you to me.
I trust your journey from London has been a happy one...
...and that you will enjoy your stay... ...in my beautiful land.
Your friend, D."
Diary, 25th May.
My Jonathan has been gone almost a week. Mina Murray's Diary 25th May
And although I was disappointed we could not marry before his departure...
...I am happy that he got sent on this important assignment.
I am longing to hear all the news.
It must be so nice to see strange countries.
I wonder if we-- I mean Jonathan and I...
...shall ever see them together.
We're early, driver. No one is here.
For the dead travel fast.
I say, is the castle far?
Welcome to my home.
Enter freely of your own will... ...and leave some of the happiness you bring.
Count Dracula?
I am...
...Dracula.
And I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house.
Come in.
You will, I trust, excuse me that I... ...do not join you.
But I have already dined.
And I never drink...
...wine.
An ancestor? I see a resemblance.
The Order of the Dracul.
The Dragon.
An ancient society...
...pledging my forefathers...
...to defend their church against all enemies of Christ.
That relationship was not entirely...
...successful.
Oh, yes.
It is no laughing matter.
We Draculs have a right to be proud.
What devil or witch was ever so great as Attila...
...whose blood flows in these veins?
Blood...
...is too precious a thing in these times.
The warlike days are over.
The victories of my great race...
...are but a tale to be told.
I am the last of my kind.
I have offended you with my ignorance, Count.
Forgive me.
I do so long to go through the crowded streets...
I do so long to go through the crowded streets... ...of your mighty London...
...to be in the midst of the whirl and the rush of humanity...
...to share its life... ...its changes, its death.
There. You, Count, are--
Are the owner of Carfax Abbey at Purfleet.
Congratulations.
Your firm writes most highly... ...of your talents.
They say you are a man of good...
...taste.
And that you are a worthy substitute... ...to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.
...to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.
You may rely on me, Count.
Forgive my curiosity, but why ten houses...
Forgive my curiosity, but why ten houses... ...in such precise locations around London?
Is it to raise the market value?
Do you believe in destiny?
That even the powers of time...
...can be altered for a single purpose?
The luckiest man who walks on this Earth... ...is the one who finds...
...true love.
You found Mina.
I thought she was lost.
We're to be married as soon as I return.
Are you married, Count?
Sir... ...are you married?
I was married once.
Ages ago, it seems.
She died.
I'm very sorry.
She was fortunate.
My life, at its best, is misery.
She will no doubt make a devoted wife.
And you a faithful husband.
Come.
Write now, my friend, to your firm...
...and to any loved ones, and say that it shall please you...
...to stay with me...
...until a month from now.
A month?
Do you wish me to stay so long?
I will take no refusal.
Diary, 30th of May, 1897.
I know Jonathan does not want me to stay here with Lucy while he is away.
He thinks that if I become accustomed to the wealth of the Westenra family...
...I will not be content as the wife of a mere clerk in a law firm.
But Lucy and I have been friends since we were children...
...and she has never minded that I am only a schoolmistress.
How disgustingly awful.
Mina!
Oh, Mina, you're always working.
Is your ambitious Jon Harker...
...forcing you to learn that ridiculous machine?
When he could be forcing you to perform...
...unspeakable acts of desperate passion on the parlor floor.
Lucy, really.
You shouldn't talk about my fiancé in such a way.
There's more to marriage than carnal pleasure.
Oh, Mina. So I see.
Oh, Mina. So I see. Much, much more.
That's--
What is it, Lucy?
Because I don't understand it.
Can a man and woman really do...
...that?
I did, only last night.
-Fibber. You did not. -Yes, I did.
Well, in my dreams.
Jonathan measures up, doesn't he?
You can tell Lucy.
We've kissed. That's all.
He thinks he's too poor to marry me.
And it's all the worse now that I'm here visiting you at Hillingham...
...my rich friend.
Yes, but not even one marriage proposal.
And here I am, almost 20...
...practically a hag.
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.
-Oh, look. -What is that?
A Texan.
Quincey P. Morris.
He's so young and fresh...
...like a wild stallion between my legs.
You're positively indecent. I just know what men desire.
Watch.
-Quincey, darling. -Miss Lucy.
Why, you're as fresh as the spring rain. Oh, thank you.
Please let me touch it.
It's so big.
Little girl.
Oh, my dear, sweet little girl.
I hold your hand...
-...and you've kissed me. -Jack!
Oceans of love-- Oh, Jack, my darling.
Poor little baby.
My kitten, come over here.
Come over here and I'll kiss it better.
My poor little blossom.
My poor little doctor. Brilliant doctor.
-Hello, Quincey. -Jack.
What a naughty bear. Let me--
-Arthur Holmwood, Esquire. -Arthur!
Oh, my darling.
Oh, you look wonderful. I'm so sorry about your hat.
I'm so sorry about your hat.
-Charming. -It's my snake dress.
Is it really?
Lucy is a pure and virtuous girl...
...but I admit that her free way of speaking shocks me sometimes.
Jonathan says it is a defect of the aristocracy...
...that they say what they please.
The truth is that I admire Lucy. I'm not surprised that men flock around her.
I wish I were as pretty and as adored as she.
What manner of man is this?
R.M. Renfield, successful solicitor... ... in the firm of Hawkins and Thompkins... Dr. Seward's Diary on Phonograph Cylinder - 30th May
...respected member of the Lord Nugent's Windem Club...
...returns from business abroad in Transylvania...
...promptly suffers a complete mental breakdown.
He's now obsessed with some blood lust.
George.
Wait here.
Would you care for an hors d'oeuvre, Dr. Seward...
...or a canapé?
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield. How are you feeling tonight?
Far better than you, my lovesick doctor.
Is my personal life of interest to you? Of course it is. All life interests me.
Your diet, Mr. Renfield, is disgusting.
Actually, they're perfectly nutritious.
You see, each life that I ingest...
...gives back life to me.
A fly gives you life?
Certainly.
But you might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks...
But you might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks... ...than to interest me in a lesser carnivore.
I shall have to invent a new classification of lunatic for you.
What about spiders? Spiders eat the flies.
Yes, spiders eat them. What about sparrows?
Oh, yes. Did you say sparrows?
-Something larger, perhaps? -Oh, yes.
A kitten.
I beg you.
A little, sleek-- A playful kitten.
Something I can teach. Something I can feed.
No one would refuse me a kitten.
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?
Oh, yes. A big cat.
-My salvation depends upon it! -Your salvation?
Yes. I need lives.
-I need lives for the master. -What master?
The master will come...
...and he has promised to make me immortal. How?
Get him off!
The blood is the life!
The blood is the life!
30th May, Castle Dracula.
I think strange things which I dare not confess to my own soul.
The count...
...the way he looked at Mina's picture fills me with dread...
...as if I have a part to play in a story that is not known to me.
I didn't hear you come in.
Take care how you cut yourself.
It is more dangerous than you think.
A foul bauble of man's vanity.
Perhaps you should...
...grow a beard.
The letters I requested.
Have you written them?
Good.
Should you leave these rooms...
...you will not, by any chance...
...go to sleep in any other part of the castle.
It is old...
...and has many bad memories.
-Be warned. -I'm sure I understand.
Do not put your faith in such trinkets of deceit.
We are in Transylvania.
Transylvania is not England.
Our ways are not your ways.
And to you...
...there shall be many strange things.
I've seen many strange things already.
Bloody wolves chasing me through some blue inferno!
Listen to them.
The children of the night.
What sweet music they make.
Music? Those animals?
I did as Dracula instructed. I wrote three letters.
To the firm, to my family and to my beloved Mina.
I said nothing of my fears as he will read them, no doubt.
I know now that I am a prisoner.
Jonathan.
Jonathan, come to me.
Come.
Lay down.
Lay back into my arms.
Lay back, Jonathan.
How dare you touch him! He belongs to me!
You yourself never loved.
Yes. I too can love.
And I shall love again.
Are we to have nothing tonight?
"Dearest Mina, all is well here.
The count has insisted I remain for a month...
...to tutor him in English custom.
I can say no more, except I love you.
Ever faithful, Jonathan."
The letters I have written have undoubtedly sealed my doom.
The count's gypsies, fearless warriors who are loyal to the death...
...to whatever nobleman they serve...
...day and night they toil, filling boxes with decrepit earth...
...day and night they toil, filling boxes with decrepit earth... ...from the bowels of the castle.
They are to be delivered to his newly acquired Carfax Abbey in London.
Why do they fill these boxes with earth?
I love him! I love him!
It's so wonderful. I've decided.
I love him and I've said yes.
Finally. Don't tell me. The Texan with the big knife?
Finally. Don't tell me. The Texan with the big knife? Oh, no. To my dear number three.
Lord Arthur Holmwood. Lord and Lady Holmwood.
You are to be my maid of honor. Oh, say yes.
Mina, what is it? It's the most exciting day of my life.
You don't seem to care.
It's just that I'm so terribly worried about Jonathan.
This letter I received is so--
It's so cold. It's so unnatural. It's not like him at all.
Mina, don't worry.
Captain's log: the Demeter. 27th June, 1897. Captain's Log - DEMETER Varna to London
Captain's Log - DEMETER Varna to London
We picked up 50 boxes of experimental earth...
...bound for London, England.
Set sail at noon into a storm... ...that seemed to come out of nowhere...
...carrying us out to sea.
Third of July. Second mate has gone missing.
Nearing Gibraltar. Storm continues. Crew uneasy.
Believe someone or something...
...is aboard the ship with us.
Master, I am here!
The master of all life is at hand!
Gather round!
I am here to do your bidding, master!
I have worshiped you long and far off! And now you are near, master!
I am your slave!
I await your command!
The case of Renfield grows more interesting.
Yet, there is method in his madness with his flies and spiders.
Had I the secret of even one such brilliant mind...
...the key to the fancy of one lunatic....
Lucy.
Lucy? Lucy!
No. Do not see me.
Oh! I couldn't control myself.
Hush, Lucy. You're dreaming. You're walking in your sleep again.
My soul, it seemed to leave my body.
There was this agonizing feeling, and I couldn't get back to it.
I'm absolutely shaking. It's all right. You were dreaming.
I had to. It sort of pulled me and lured me.
-I had no control. -It's all right.
-It had red eyes. -Hush now.
I still have the taste of his blood in my mouth.
Here we go. Swing it round here.
Master.
I am here to do your bidding. CARFAX ABBEY LONDON
Master! I am here!
I have worshiped you.
Contrary to some beliefs, the vampire... ...like any other night creature, can move about by day...
...like any other night creature, can move about by day...
...though it is not his natural time, and his powers are weak.
See the amazing cinematograph!
A wonder of modern civilization!
The latest sensation!
The greatest attraction of the century!
The new wonder of the world!
See me.
See me now.
Escaped wolf from zoo still at large! Buy a paper, sir?
Thank you, sir.
Get your Gazette! Penny a paper!
My humblest apologies.
Forgive my ignorance.
I am recently arrived from abroad... ...and I do not know your city.
-Is a beautiful lady-- -A street atlas is sixpence. Good day.
I have offended you.
I am only looking for the cinematograph.
I understand it is a wonder of the civilized world.
If you seek culture, then visit a museum.
London is filled with them. Excuse me.
A woman so lovely and intelligent...
...should not be walking the streets of London without her gentleman.
Do I know you, sir?
Are you acquainted with my husband?
Shall I call the police?
Husband?
I shall bother you no more.
Sir.
It is I who have been rude.
-If you're looking-- -Please.
Permit me to introduce myself.
I am Prince Vlad of Sagite.
-A prince, no less? -I am...
...your servant.
Wilhelmina Murray.
I am...
...honored...
...Madam Mina.
This way.
Hello, sir.
Mr. Holmwood asked me to stop by to see Miss Lucy.
Yes, sir.
-Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy. -Thank you.
Oh, Jack!
Brilliant Jack. Do you like it?
Did Arthur put you up to this...
...or did you want me alone just once before I'm married?
Lucy, you're embarrassing me.
I'm here as your doctor.
Your fiancé is very worried about you...
...and I assure you, a doctor's confidence is sacred.
I must have your complete trust.
Help me, Jack.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I'm changing.
I can feel it.
I can hear everything.
I hear the servants at the other end of the house, whispering.
I hear mice in the attic, stomping like elephants.
But I'm having horrible nightmares, Jack.
The eyes.
Oh, Jack.
I'm here, Lucy. Nothing will harm you.
Let it work.
-Thank you. -Lucy.
Oh, Jack, kiss me.
And may I say, Miss Lucy is hotter than a June bride...
...riding bareback buck naked in the Sahara.
I would watch my colonial tongue if I were you.
Hello, Jack. And how's our lovely patient today?
Well, frankly, Arthur, I'm confounded.
Jack, are you still brooding over Miss Lucy?
I can only conclude it must be something mental.
How very droll. Did you hear that, Quince?
Last week he wanted to marry her, and now he wants to have her committed.
Let's have a look at her.
I'm at a loss, I admit.
I've taken the liberty of cabling Abraham Van Helsing... ...the metaphysician, philosopher.
Sounds like a goddamn witch doctor to me, Jack.
Van Helsing knows more about obscure diseases than any man in the world.
He's my teacher and mentor.
Do it, man. Bring him here.
Spare no expense.
Astounding.
There are no limits to science.
How can you call this science?
Do you think Madam Curie would invite such comparisons? Really.
I shouldn't have come here.
I must go.
Do not fear me.
Stop this. Stop this.
My God. Who are you?
I know you.
I have crossed oceans of time... ...to find you.
There is no need to panic.
The animal handlers have everything under complete control.
Come here, Mina.
He likes you.
There is much to be learned from beasts.
The tropical pampas vampire bat must...
...consume ten times its own weight in fresh blood each day...
...or its own blood cells will die.
Cute little vermin, ja?
Blood and the diseases of the blood...
...such as syphilis, they concern us here.
The very name "venereal diseases"...
...the diseases of Venus, imputes to them divine origin.
And they are involved in that sex problem about which...
...the ethics and ideals of Christian civilization are concerned.
In fact, civilization and syphilization have advanced together.
-What is this? -It's from the telegraph, Professor.
Telegraph?
Thank you. Gentlemen, thank you. That will be all.
Dawn.
These may be the last words I write in this journal.
Dracula has left me with these women... ...these devils of the pit.
They drain my blood to keep me weak...
...barely alive so I cannot escape.
I will try one last time today to escape to the water.
There must be passageway to the river...
...and then away from this cursed land...
...where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet.
For the record, I do attest... that at this point, I, Abraham Van Helsing...
that at this point, I, Abraham Van Helsing...
...became personally involved in these strange events.
Professor Van Helsing, how good of you to come.
I always come to my friends in need when they call me.
So, Jack, tell me everything about your case.
She has all the usual physical anemic signs.
Her blood analyzes normal, and yet it is not.
She manifests continued blood loss. I cannot trace the cause.
Blood loss? How?
My God, close the doors!
My God...
...she's only a child.
Ja.
My God.
There's no time to lose. There must be a transfusion at once.
Take off your coat. Remember how to tie a tourniquet?
Take off your coat. Remember how to tie a tourniquet? -Or have you forgotten? -You perfected a procedure?
-Or have you forgotten? -You perfected a procedure?
Perfected? No. I've only experimented.
Landsteiner's method.
Animals, goats, sheeps.
If hemolysis occurs in the blood donor serum...
...her red blood cells will explode.
She will die. Take this tube.
What in God's name is going on up here?
This is Professor Van Helsing, Art.
-What the hell is he doing to Lucy? -He's trying to save her life.
-Good God! -You're the fiancé? Please.
Take off your coat. This young lady's very ill. She's dying.
She wants blood and blood she must have.
Take off your coat.
Roll up your sleeve, Art.
-Oh, God. -Quickly, quickly.
Roll it up!
This may hurt a little, Art.
Forgive me. My life is hers. I would give my last drop of blood to save her.
Forgive me. My life is hers. I would give my last drop of blood to save her. Your last drop?
Your last drop?
Thank you.
You are very welcome here. I don't ask as much as that. Not yet.
Hold her hand.
Jack, that poor creature has had the blood of two men put into her already.
Man alive. Her whole body couldn't hold that much blood.
-What took it out? -That's a good question, Mr. Morris.
Those marks on her throat...
...no disease, no trituration...
...I am sure the blood loss occurred there.
Oh? Where did the blood go?
You were once a careful student, Jack.
Use your brain! Where did the blood go? Tell me!
-The bed would be covered in blood. -Exactly.
You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear...
...that which you cannot account for.
Something just went up there, sucked it out of her and flew away?
Ja. Why not?
That's brilliant. That's absolutely brilliant.
Will one of you learned doctors, or whatever you are...
...kindly tell me what is going on with my Lucy?
Jack, you are a scientist.
Do you not think there are things in this universe you cannot understand...
Do you not think there are things in this universe you cannot understand... ...and which are true. Mesmerism, hypnotism?
...and which are true. Mesmerism, hypnotism?
You and Charcot have proved hypnotism.
Materialization, astral bodies.
Professor?
Where did he go?
You see?
I feel like a blundering novice.
Gentlemen, we're not fighting some disease here.
Those marks on your dear Miss Lucy's neck were made...
...by something unspeakable out there.
Dead, but not dead.
It stalks us for some dread purpose I do not comprehend.
To live, it feeds on Lucy's precious blood.
It is a beast, a monster.
What is happening to Lucy and to me?
When I was younger, my feelings were never troubled.
I wish I were myself again...
...the sensible Mina I always depended on.
Absinthe...
...is the aphrodisiac of the self.
The green fairy...
...who lives in the absinthe...
...wants your soul.
But...
...you are safe with me.
Tell me, Prince...
...tell me of your home.
The most beautiful place...
...in all creation.
Yes, it must be.
A land beyond a great, vast forest...
...surrounded by majestic mountains...
...lush vineyards...
...and flowers of such frailty and beauty...
...as to be found nowhere else.
You've described my home... ...as if you had seen it firsthand.
It's your voice, perhaps.
It's so familiar.
It's like--
It's like a voice in a dream I cannot place...
...and it comforts me.
-When I am alone. -When you are alone.
And what of the princess?
Princess?
There is always a princess...
...with gowns flowing white.
And her face.
Oh, God...
...her face...
...is a river.
The princess...
...she's a river filled with tears of sadness...
...and heartbreak.
There was a princess.
Elisabeta.
She was the most radiant woman... ...in all the empires of the world.
Man's deceit took her from her ancient prince.
She leapt to her death... ...into the river that you spoke of.
In my mother's tongue...
...it is called...
...argesh.
River princess.
Dear Madam.
Your fiancé is safe and in the care... Sister Agatha's Letter 12th August
Sister Agatha's Letter 12th August ...of the good sisters of the Blessed Sacrament.
Mr. Harker believes your life is in extreme danger...
...and he desires with all urgency that you join him here...
...so that you may immediately be married.
Yours with all blessings, Sister Agatha.
My sweet prince.
Jonathan must never know of us.
Dr. Van Helsing.
And you're Madam Mina, dear friend to our Lucy, ja?
-How is she, doctor? -She's still very weak.
She tells me of your beloved Jonathan Harker...
...and your worry for him.
Well, I, too, worry for all young lovers.
There are darknesses in life, my child...
...and there are lights.
You are one of the lights, dear Mina...
...the light of all light.
Go now. See your friend.
You look different.
You look positively radiant.
You heard from Jonathan.
-Didn't you? -Yes.
He's safe.
He's in a convent in Romania.
He's suffering from a violent brain fever.
The good sisters are caring for him.
They wrote to me, and they say he needs me...
...but I won't go.
I'm not going to leave you.
You've got to go to him...
...and you've got to love him...
...and marry him right then and there.
And I want you to take this, my sister.
It's my wedding gift to you.
Don't worry about spoiled little Lucy.
I'll be all right.
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.
Jack, how is she?
This is why I cannot breathe!
Lucy, it's medicinal.
To help you sleep. To dream better dreams.
It's garlic! It's nothing but common garlic!
It's garlic! It's nothing but common garlic! Quincey's here to see you. Get some brandy.
Quincey's here to see you. Get some brandy.
Now, Miss Lucy, you just rest easy.
Arthur sent me to take care of you.
He said if you don't get better quick...
...I have to put you out of your misery like a lame horse.
You're such a beast.
Will you kiss me?
Kiss me.
-That old coot! -Get off me!
-That old coot! -Get off me! Listen to me! Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.
You're at peace.
Look. There. There.
Nosferatu.
"Here occurs the shocking and frightening history...
...of the wild, berserk Prince Dracula.
How he impaled people and roasted them...
...boiled their heads in a kettle...
...how he skinned them alive...
...and hacked them to pieces and then drank their blood."
Dracul.
For blood is the life.
"My dearest Prince, forgive me.
I have received word from my fiancé in Romania.
I am en route to join him. We are to be married.
I will never see you again.
Mina."
It is odd, but I feel almost... ...that my strange friend is with me.
He speaks to me in my thoughts.
With him I felt more alive than ever I had.
And now without him, soon to be a bride...
...I feel confused and lost.
Perhaps, though I try to be good, I am bad.
Perhaps I am a bad, inconstant woman.
Winds!
It is the cause.
It is the cause of my soul!
It is Dracula...
...the undead...
...the foe I have pursued all my life.
Dracula!
Jack, hurry! I have much to tell you.
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.
Do not fail here tonight.
We are dealing with forces beyond all human experience...
...an enormous power, so guard her well.
Otherwise your precious Lucy will become a bitch of the devil...
...a whore of darkness!
You're a sick old buzzard.
Hear me out, young man.
Lucy is not a random victim attacked by mere accident.
Do you understand? No.
She is a willing recruit, a breathless, wanton follower.
I dare say, a devoted disciple.
She is the devil's concubine!
Do you understand me?
Yet, we may still save her precious soul.
But not on an empty stomach.
-Jack! -Here, sir.
I starve. Feed me.
You old coot!
Your impotent men with their foolish spells...
...cannot protect you from my power.
I condemn you to living death...
...to eternal hunger...
...for living blood.
I know how deeply you loved her. That is why you must trust me and believe.
Believe? How can I believe?
I want you to bring me, before nightfall, a set of postmortem knives.
An autopsy? Lucy?
No, not exactly. I just want to cut off her head and take out her heart.
Diary, 17th September.
Poor Jonathan. He's still so ill.
He's cheered by the familiar streets in London.
For me, now that Lucy is dead, it is a sad homecoming.
It is as if a part of me is dead too...
...except for the tiny hope that lives in me...
...that I will again see my prince.
Is he here?
Now that I am married...
...I begin to understand the nature of my feelings for my strange friend...
...who is always in my thoughts.
Jonathan, what is it?
It is the man himself.
Look, he's grown young.
Gentlemen, must we desecrate poor Lucy's grave?
She died horribly enough.
If Miss Lucy is dead, then no wrong can be done to her.
But if she's not dead....
What are you saying, man? That she's been buried alive?
No. All I say is she is undead.
Undead.
This is insane.
Gentlemen, shall we?
One, two, three.
Where is she?
What have you done with her?
She lives beyond the grace of God...
...a wanderer in the outer darkness.
She is vampyre, nosferatu.
These creatures do not die like the bee after the first sting...
...but instead grow strong and become immortal...
...once infected by another nosferatu.
So my friends, we fight not one beast...
...but legions that go on age after age after age...
...feeding on the blood of the living.
Quickly, hide. Now.
Come to me, Arthur.
Leave these others and come to me.
My arms are hungry for you, my darling.
Kiss me and caress me...
...my darling husband, please.
We wave Christ and His holy blood!
We are strong in the Lord and the power of His might!
The power of God is upon us!
I bring you from shadow into light!
I cast you out, the prince of darkness...
...into hell!
A moment's courage, and it is done.
Take the stake in your left hand...
...place the point over the heart.
Then in God's name, strike. Do it now!
Eat, feast. You'll need your strength for the dark days ahead.
-Doctor? -Ja?
How did Lucy die?
Well--
Was she in great pain?
Ja, she was in great pain. Then we cut off her head...
...drove a stake through her heart and burned it and then she found peace.
Doctor! Please.
So, Mr. Harker...
...I must now ask you, as your doctor...
...a sensitive question.
During your infidelity with those creatures...
...those demonic women...
...did you, for one instant, taste of their blood?
Good!
Then you have not infected your blood with the terrible...
...disease that destroyed poor Lucy.
Doctor, you must understand.
I doubted everything...
...even my mind.
I was impotent with fear.
-I know. -But, sir...
...I know where the bastard sleeps.
I brought him there, to Carfax Abbey.
Vampires do exist.
And this one we fight, this one we face...
...has the strength of 20 or more people...
...and you can testify for that, Mr. Harker.
But he can also control the meaner things of life...
...the bat, the rodent, the wolf.
He can appear as mist, as vapor, as fog and vanish at will.
Now, all these things Dracula can do... ...but he is not free.
He must rest in the sacred earth of his homeland to gain his evil power.
It is here that we must find him and destroy him utterly.
I almost feel pity for anything so hunted as this count.
How can you pity such a creature?
I'll take Mina to my quarters.
Good. You'll be safer there.
Mr. Morris, your bullets will not harm him.
He must be beheaded. I suggest you use your big bowie knife.
Well, I wasn't planning on getting that close, Doc.
Master!
Dr. Jack!
I've been promised eternal life!
Dr. Seward, who is that man?
Mr. Renfield. This is no place for you, Madam Mina.
Mr. Renfield. This is no place for you, Madam Mina. Renfield? I must see him.
Renfield? I must see him.
Mr. Renfield, behave yourself.
This is Mrs. Harker.
-Good evening. -Good evening, Mr. Renfield.
It seems I've been rather naughty.
I know you.
You're the bride my master covets.
I have a husband.
I am Mrs. Harker.
My master tells me about you.
What does he tell you?
That he is coming.
That he is coming for you.
Oh, please.
Don't stay here.
Get away from these men, please.
And I pray to God I may never see your sweet face again.
And may the Lord bless and keep you.
Master! Master!
You promised me eternal life...
...but you give it to the pretty woman!
Dr. Jack!
I'm no lunatic man!
I'm a sane man fighting for his soul!
My quarters are spare, but I think you will find them comfortable.
Dr. Jack!
Water and toiletries at your disposal.
You'll be completely safe here.
Destroy every box. Sterilize the earth inside.
Leave him no refuge.
Let the exorcism begin.
You have betrayed me.
No, master.
I serve you.
I serve only you.
Oh, yes, my love.
You've found me.
My most precious life.
I have wanted this to happen.
I know that now.
I want to be with you always.
You cannot know what you are saying.
Yes...
...I do know.
I feared I would never feel your touch again.
I thought you were dead.
There is no life in this body.
But you live.
You live.
What are you?
I must know. You must tell me.
I am...
...nothing.
Lifeless.
-Soulless. -What do you mean?
Hated and feared.
I am dead to all the world.
Hear me.
I am the monster... ...that breathing men would kill.
I am Dracula.
You murdered Lucy!
I love you.
Oh, God, forgive me, I do.
I want to be what you are...
...see what you see... ...love what you love.
To walk with me...
...you must die to your breathing life...
...and be reborn to mine.
You are my love...
...and my life always.
Then...
...I give you life eternal...
...everlasting love...
...the power of the storm...
...and the beasts of the earth.
Walk with me...
...to be my loving wife forever.
I will. Yes. Yes.
Drink and join me...
...in eternal life.
I cannot let this be.
Please, I don't care. Make me yours.
You will be cursed as I am to walk in the shadow of death...
You will be cursed as I am to walk in the shadow of death... ....for all eternity.
I love you too much...
...to condemn you.
Then take me away from all this death.
You think you can destroy me... ...with your idols?
Sacred blood of Christ!
I, who served the cross.
I, who commanded nations...
...hundreds of years before you were born.
Your armies were defeated.
You tortured and impaled thousands of people.
I was betrayed.
Look what your God... ...has done to me.
No, your war with God is over. You must pay for your crimes.
Christ compels you!
She is now...
...my bride!
More light!
Light! More light!
Unclean.
-Get them! -This way!
-Get them! -They must be found.
Unclean.
We have learned something much.
Dracula fears us. He fears time.
For, if not, why does he hurry so?
He is gone.
How do you know?
He speaks to me.
He has a strong mind connection to you.
His heart was strong enough to survive the grave.
-You admire him. -Ja.
He was, in life, a most remarkable man...
...and his mind was great and powerful...
...but greater is the necessity to stamp him out...
...and destroy him utterly.
-Doctor? -Ja?
I know that I am becoming like him.
Your salvation is his destruction.
That is why I want to hypnotize you.
I want you to help me find him before it is too late.
Please, help me find him. Please.
Look into this light...
...the light of all light, into this flame.
Your eyes are heavy.
You want to sleep. Sleep now.
-Sleep. -I must go to him.
He calls.
What do you hear?
What do you hear, child?
What do you hear?
Oh, my prince is calling me.
He is traveling across icy seas to his beloved home.
There he will grow strong again.
I am coming to him to partake of his strength.
We left London by train and crossed the English Channel in stormy seas...
...no doubt from the passage of the count's ship.
He commands the winds, but we still have the advantage.
By train, we can reach the Romanian port at Varna in three days.
By ship, it will take him at least a week.
From Paris, we traveled through the Alps to Budapest.
The count must sail around the Rock of Gibraltar...
...where we have posted a lookout...
...and then on to the Black Sea port in Varna...
...where we will meet his ship and burn it into the sea.
Home. Home.
The vampire's baptized her with his own blood...
...and her blood is dying, my friend.
It is no use.
I will not let you go into the unknown alone.
Oh, my poor, dear Jonathan.
Oh, what have I done to you?
No, I have done this to both of us.
I can hear him. He's coming closer.
He's calling me to him.
Stay with me. Please.
I am so cold.
All aboard!
Noon. Holmwood received a wire from his clerk at Lloyd's.
The count's ship sailed past us in the night fog...
...to the northern port of Galatz.
The black devil is reading Mina's mind.
How can we catch him now?
Varna. Galatz.
It's about 200 miles.
I think that with the horses, we can cut him off...
...reach him before he reaches the castle.
I will dispatch Van Helsing straight for the Borgo Pass.
If we fail in our task...
...you will have to finish him.
From Varna, Mina and Van Helsing took a carriage...
...and we continued on the train towards Galatz...
...where we still hoped to intercept the count before he reaches land.
I am fearful for Mina. She is now our decoy.
I know this place.
-The end of the world. -We must go on.
It is late, child. We must rest here now.
No, we must go!
He needs me. We must go!
We have passed Bistritza.
Dracula has outsmarted us again.
We learned that his gypsies took charge of the vampire's box at Galatz...
...and are now on the Borgo Pass road.
-Here. You must eat. -I am not hungry.
You have been so good to me, Professor.
I know that Lucy harbored secret desires for you.
She told me.
I, too, know what men desire.
Will you cut off my head...
...and drive a stake through my heart...
...as you did poor Lucy, you murdering bastard?
Not while I live. I am sworn to protect you.
You are safe within the circle.
I've lost Lucy. I'll not lose you to him.
You're whores of Satan!
This is holy ground.
Leave this place now!
Leave!
In the name of God, leave this ground!
I command you in the name of Christ!
Christ! Damn you!
Dracul!
You are... ...near.
My love.
They're racing against the sunset.
It may be too late. God help us.
Harker, shoot!
Charge!
When my time comes, will you do the same to me?
Will you?
-Wait. -Let them go. Let them go. Our work is finished here.
Let them go. Our work is finished here.
Hers has just begun.
We've all become God's madmen.
All of us.
Where is my God?
He has forsaken me.
It is finished.
My love.
My love.
There, in the presence of God...
...I understood at last how my love could release us all...
...from the powers of darkness.
This is the hour, ours is the magic Ours is the power, now is the time
This is the hour, ours is the magic Ours is the power, now is the time
This is the hour, ours is the magic Ours is the power, now is the time
This is the hour, ours is the magic Ours is the power, now is the time Ours is the hour, now is the time Ours is the hour, ours is the magic

Ours is the hour, now is the time Ours is the hour, ours is the magic Ours is the power
I need your seat in the upright position, please.
Come on, let's go. Come on, darling, taxi's waiting.
-Oh, no. -Oh, yeah, it's a lot drier in here, Dad.
-Oh, God. We need a new roof. -Yeah.
-But it's big. It's big. -I like the peg and groove floors.
-Damask curtains would look nice. -Yeah.
-I gotta get this roof fixed, honey. -Yeah.
I found this out back. Do you want it?
Relax. What's the matter with you? Relax.
-Dad! -What? What is it? What?
Hey! What the--?
Get the hell out of here! What the hell?
Sarah, you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. He surprised me, that's all.
Yeah, I guess.
-Are you sure? -Yeah. I'm fine.
Dad.
You could wait. You know, just until you got a school uniform.
-You don't have to go now. -I can't stay home...
...and watch TV for the rest of my life.
Why not? I could.
I just wanna get started and get it over with.
You look good. You look good. Good luck. Jenny will pick you up.
-I'll walk. -Are you sure?
Yeah.
-Hey, scary bitch alert. -Oh, God. I thought it was Satan.
Oh, my God. She's-- She looking?
Oh, God. Oh, she's looking. Find a warm place--
A safe, warm place.
The almanac says today will bring an arrival of something.
Yeah, wonderful, I'm getting my rag.
"A new wholeness and with it, a new balance.
Earth, air, water, fire." Maybe it's our fourth.
-We don't need a fourth. -Nancy, we need someone... ...to call out the corners: north, south, east and west.
...to call out the corners: north, south, east and west.
-Four would make a circle. -Maybe she can be our fourth.
-Come on. -I love a woman in uniform.
Oh, you mean, did I get laid?
Oui, beaucoup des-- Beaucoup de "laid."
What is that snail trail over there saying about me?
You know, this is L.A. We should be learning Mexican, like....
-That would be Spanish, genius. -Spanish.
She's here.
-"She" who? -Someone to be the fourth.
She's the one.
Are you feeling okay?
That's her.
Hey, do you guys mind if I sit with you?
Because I'm supposed to find a lab group.
Okay.
No, you-- You can sit here.
Happy?
What?
-Hi. -Hi.
-You're Sarah, right? Hi, I'm Chris. -Yeah.
I wanted to apologize for those guys in French. They're assholes.
They say you are what you hang with.
Yeah, right.
Wait, did you just call me an asshole?
-You did, didn't you? -I'm sorry.
My defenses are up. People here have been really rude to me.
-Oh, really? Who else? -These three girls. Look behind you.
Don't stare.
That's slick.
-Oh, shit, it's the Bitches of Eastwick. -What?
Whatever you do, stay away from them.
Why?
Well, you see the one on the right? She's a major slut.
I mean, I don't know from experience or anything, but....
And the one in the middle, she's got these burn scars all over her body.
I haven't seen them, but friends of mine have.
Anyway, they're-- No, never mind.
What? What?
-They're witches. -Witches.
Well, that's what people say.
So, what are you doing after school?
-I don't know. Nothing, I guess. -Really?
-Really. -I'm busy.
Football practice. You can come to watch.
Football practice. That is so tempting.
-Sarah. Looking for someone? -No.
Some football dicks make their girlfriends...
...come and watch them practice, as if it's interesting.
Yeah, like the girlfriend over there. Chris Hooker?
I don't even know him.
Nancy's sorry about what happened in biology.
And she's mean to everybody, so don't take it personally.
-You're Nancy? -She's Nancy.
I'm Bonnie and that's Rochelle.
-Hi. I'm Sarah. -Yeah. We know who you are.
-Do you wanna go for coffee? -No, I can't. I gotta get home.
My dad's waiting for me.
You can make something up. Rochelle's ditching practice.
-He comes on to anything with tits. -Except me.
-I'm not watching him. -He spreads disease.
I speak from personal experience.
Run, Chris! Go long! Go for the pass, baby.
He's a jerk.
Come on.
-So you're coming, right? -Where we going?
-Shopping. -Come on.
-I don't have any money. -We get a five-finger discount.
Five-finger discount.
-Sarah, where'd you live before? -San Francisco.
-Why did you move? -Because it sucks there.
My dad wanted to.
-It sucks here too. -I know. You need a car here.
-You need a car everywhere. -What's up with that?
I slit my wrists.
Sorry.
-What did you do it with? -With a kitchen knife.
-You even did it the right way. -Yeah.
Punk rock. Let's go.
The "right way"?
-How do you know the right way? -Shut up, Rochelle.
Well, how do you know?
Sarah.
What?
-Put this in your bag. -No.
Everything in nature steals, you know. Big animals steal from little ones.
They steal for survival. Besides, I already have a diary.
This is different. You put spells and power thoughts in it...
...and then you don't let anyone else read it, ever.
Except maybe us.
Here.
-You guys are really into all this? -Sort of.
-That's not for you. -I'm sorry.
What a beautiful ring. It was your mother's.
Yeah, it was.
Are you going to pay for those?
You're not like your friends.
-You know how to use candles? -Yeah. You light the wick.
More than that. Red is for love.
Black-- Actually....
Why you don't read that?
-It explains it all. -Okay.
Twenty dollars.
You know, I've never read anything about this stuff before.
I mean, I don't follow it.
Maybe you're a natural witch. Your power comes from within.
Come on, Sarah.
-You guys, I think I should head home. -Just look straight ahead and keep up.
-Please, my baby needs some food. -I don't have anything.
Don't give them money. You're gonna get nailed.
-I don't have anything. -Hey, I know you.
I have another snake for you.
Hey, wait a second. I have to talk to you.
I had a dream about you.
In my dream, you were dead!
I'm talking to you.
Come back, child. Come back to Jesus.
Don't you run away from me! I am the god of the--
I know what I'm talking about. I'm in touch with the man!
Listen to me!
Come on, Sarah. Let's get out of here.
Oh, my God.
-Is anybody back there? -No.
We hit him. It hit him.
The car hit him and we made it happen.
-Maybe, maybe not. -No. I thought, "It's gonna hit him."
I thought, "It's gonna hit him."
-I thought it too. -Well, I thought it too.
-Sarah, did you think it? -Yeah.
That's it. Sarah's the fourth. North, south, east and west.
We can make things happen. I mean, this is it. This is real.
Shit.
You guys, this is really weird.
I mean, he was after you. He was gonna hurt you, man.
-It's not our fault, I mean-- -Maybe he'll really listen now.
-Who? -Manon.
What's that? That's, like, God?
No, man invented God. This is older than that.
Do you guys worship the devil?
It's like God and the devil.
I mean, it's everything.
It's the trees, it's the ground, it's the rocks, the moon.
-It's everything. -It's nature.
If God and the devil were playing football...
...Manon would be the stadium that they played on.
It would be the sun that shone down on them.
So does stuff like tonight happen to you a lot?
No. Not like that. Other stuff.
-Where did you learn it? -I don't know.
A natural witch.
I hate it. It's always getting screwed up.
It's like sometimes I'll want it to rain...
...and a pipe will burst in my room and it'll just get flooded.
-Yeah, right. -No, really.
Or I'll want it just to be quiet, and I'll wish for it and wish for it.
And then I'll go deaf for three days straight.
If you can do that, have you ever heard of invoking the spirit?
No.
That's when you call him.
Manon.
It's like-- It's like you take him into you.
It's like he fills you.
He takes everything that's gone wrong in your life...
...and he makes it all better again.
Nothing makes everything all better again.
Maybe not for you.
-Where are you going? -You guys are freaking me out.
Oh, she's scared.
-Nancy, we need her. -Like a hole in the head.
She'll be back.
What?
You sounded strange when I called last night. I didn't think you'd come.
-No, I was just surprised. -Surprised?
-I thought you'd be with those girls. -What girls?
-Those girls with the weird heads. -Weird heads?
-Yeah. -What's weird about their heads?
Well, that one girl, you know, she's got a mammoth head.
-Really? -Yeah. She looks like a St. Bernard.
-I haven't noticed her. -I hate that, that big head thing.
Of course, it's better than that shrunken head thing.
Makes you wanna hang it from the rearview mirror.
What's your obsession with heads?
Well, I was just noticing how great yours is.
-You like my head? -Yeah, it's a good head.
-"It's a good head." -It's good. It's good for kissing. Can I?
-We'll see you later, bro. -Nice meeting you, Sarah.
-Yeah, bye. -See you.
Come on. Let's go to my house. Nobody's there.
I don't-- I don't wanna go.
I can't. I gotta go home.
All right.
Are you mad?
No.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
So, hot stuff, how did it go? -How'd what go? -Your date with Chris.
-How'd what go? -Your date with Chris.
-What are you talking about? -Chris already told everybody.
-He told everybody what? -That you guys did it.
But we didn't do it.
Well, maybe he was just trying to save face then.
Because he's going around the whole school...
...saying that you're the lousiest lay he's ever had.
And coming from him, that's pretty bad.
-No, he didn't. -He did.
He said the same thing about Nancy. I told you he was a jerk.
Can I talk to you for a sec? Chris?
I'm sorry. Chris is really busy.
Maybe we could set something up for-- Nice jacket.
--later in the week.
Why did you lie about me?
Look, I don't wanna go out with you again.
Okay?
Please stop begging. It's pathetic.
Hey, Chris.
Fuck you.
No.
But I will.
She's gonna cry. And then I'm gonna cry.
Then we're all gonna cry.
This is a joke.
I can't even believe this.
Oh, wait, here she goes.
Shark!
-Very good. -Brilliant. Superb.
Oh, God, look. There is a pubic hair in my brush.
Oh, no, wait, wait.
That's just one of Rochelle's little nappy hairs.
Why are you doing this to me, Laura? Do you think you're funny?
You really wanna know why?
Yes, I really wanna know why.
Because I don't like Negroids. Sorry.
I've told you this before, but I wanna be really clear.
This is a very experimental procedure.
And we can't make any warranties regarding results or side effects.
I can tell you unofficially that there's little to no risk.
With this form of gene therapy, it's relatively non-invasive.
It can be somewhat painful, but non-invasive.
Okay, try to stay relaxed.
I'm moving the armature over you now.
And you'll feel a little sting when the needle penetrates.
And then more when the needle moves.
I'll try and keep it as brief as possible.
Hold very still, but keep breathing.
Okay?
Good. Keep your body relaxed.
Just a little more, Bonnie.
Don't move.
Ray, the light's out! Oh, man.
You-- You didn't even pay the bill. I gave you money. You didn't pay the bill. What you doing home so late?
You didn't pay the bill. What you doing home so late?
You're late.
It's the storm, Grace. It's the connection, Grace.
-Oh, it's a storm? -That's why the lights are out.
The neighbor's lights aren't out.
I give you money, and you tell me you paid the bill.
But you can't even pay a bill? What are you good for?
You know what I'm good for.
Hey, Sarah. We're going on a field trip.
Miss Downs, I hate to interrupt your little social gathering.
Sorry, Sister.
Watch out for those weirdoes. We are the weirdoes, mister.
Earth, air, fire, water
Earth, air, fire, water
Earth, air, fire, water
-Water, water, water -Air, air, air
Earth, air, fire, water....
It is better that you should rush upon this blade...
...than enter the circle with fear in your heart.
-How do you enter? -With perfect love and perfect trust.
It is better that you should rush upon this blade...
...than enter the circle with fear in your heart.
-How do you enter? -With perfect love and perfect trust.
It is better that you should rush upon this blade...
...than enter the circle with fear in your heart.
How do you enter?
With perfect love and perfect trust.
That's a girl.
As above, so below.
I drink of my sisters...
...and I ask for the ability to not hate those who hate me.
Especially racist pieces of bleached-blond shit like Laura Lizzie.
Right on.
I drink of my sisters...
...and I ask to love myself more and to let myself be loved by others.
Especially Chris Hooker. I know, it's pathetic.
Definitely pathetic.
I drink of my sisters...
...and I take into myself the power to be beautiful outside as well as in.
I drink of my sisters...
...and I take into myself...
...all the power of Manon.
That's all?
Blessed be.
-Blessed be. -Blessed be. Blessed be.
I thought you were gonna burp.
-Oh, my God. -What?
Look.
-It's Manon. -It's so beautiful.
He's listening to us.
-Do you think it's working? -I don't know.
I think he just looked at me. Did he look at me?
-Is he looking? -Not right now, but he just did.
-So weird. -I know.
-He's looking? -Yes.
-Is he still back there? -Yep.
-Sarah. -Yeah?
Never mind.
-It's working. -That, or he's gone completely crazy.
-You hate me, right? -No.
-You don't? -No.
Because, you see, when you're a guy, and I am, people expect things.
I mean, I know I said some nasty things about you.
-Did you tell your friends? -What?
-That you're a lying sack of shit. -No, but I will.
-I'll tell them tomorrow. I'll tell the truth. -Good.
-Can I sit with you in Mass? -Yeah, sure.
Watch this:
Chris, could you carry these for me? They're really heavy.
Oh, and Bonnie's too. She's got a bad back.
And this. Thanks.
Hey, Chris, could you hold my jock for me? It's kind of heavy.
In the book of Genesis....
What are you, the Stepford boy?
Sit.
Hey. Pay attention.
It's working. Check it out, her spell is working.
Nancy, oh, my God. Would you look?
-I'm sorry, I'm really bad. -Get one in already.
Look, it's hard, you know.
You're like-- You're like two feet away from each other.
Get off.
-I'm not that heavy. -Yeah, you're light as a feather.
-During deep space travel. -I am, actually.
Did you guys ever play that game Light as a Feather, Stiff as a Board?
No.
One girl lays down and you surround her...
...and you put your fingers underneath--
Put your fingers where?
Okay.
Now, you take your index finger and your middle finger...
...and you put it under her, like this.
Now you have to imagine she's incredibly light, made out of air.
-Her whole body, or just her head? -Cow!
You guys, come on, concentrate, or it's not gonna work.
-I think I sprained my finger. -Shut up.
Focus.
Come on, you guys. Come on. Ready?
Light as a feather Stiff as a board
Light as a feather Stiff as a board
Light as a feather Stiff as a board
Holy shit.
You guys, it's not working.
Shut up, or you're gonna fall.
How do I get down?
Who's got the instructions?
Just keep concentrating.
Amazing.
Hi, I got clean towels for everyone.
Oh, my butt!
-What's going on in here? -Nothing. Why?
-Are you girls getting high? -No, Mom.
-Are you okay? -You gotta try it.
-You pulled my hair out! -Sorry, I thought I saw a bug.
They have shampoo for that, you know.
Stupid bitch.
-Laura really has split ends. -Really?
I guess this confirms she's not a natural blond.
Bleach.
What do you think will happen to Laura?
I don't know. If she leaves you alone, nothing will happen to her.
-Nothing could. -Fat chance.
-Who's that? -That's my real mother.
-Where is she? -She died when she was having me.
-Sorry. -It's okay.
Manon. Take my scars.
Give me beauty outside as well as in.
Manon, take my scars.
Take my scars.
Take my scars.
-Don't hit your head on the board. -Put a lid on it, Laura.
Oh, my God!
-What's the matter? -Oh, my God.
-What happened? -I don't know.
What does it look like?
Gross!
Now I want you to remember that we may need several passes...
...before we can see any results.
-Is it better? -I can't tell yet, dear.
-Just a minute. -What does it look like?
I don't know. Just wait.
I can't believe it.
-It worked. -What?
It worked.
Bonnie.
Seriously, if you don't stop, you can-- You can go blind.
Hairy palms?
She was supposed to come back today. Did you talk to her?
-No. -Principal Draper has called...
-No. -Principal Draper has called... ...a special assembly during the second half of the fifth period.
-Homeroom starts at 8:45 sharp. -Sorry, my pedicure ran late.
Bonnie.
-Holy shit. -Hi, Bonnie.
-How's it going? -Yeah, how's it going, Bonnie?
My God.
You look so beautiful. I can't believe it.
-You did it. -No, I didn't.
-Yeah, you did. You totally did it. -I helped.
Come on, you made Chris love you. You own him.
You made Laura Lizzie's hair fall out.
You guys should see her. She has to wear a hat every day now.
Poor Laura.
-What's wrong with Nancy? -Her spell's not working.
-What spell? -I don't know.
I think she doesn't wanna be white trash anymore or something.
I told her, like, "You're white, honey. Just deal with it."
-I can almost see through this thing. -Leave me alone!
-Jesus. -God.
-You're supposed to act like a father. -I ain't her father.
Thank God.
Her father was the one who paid you $50 for a quick bang.
Hey.
-Don't you ever hit me! -Don't touch her! Stop!
What the hell is that? Oh, my God. Oh, God.
You pig.
Ray?
-O2's flowing. -He's asystole. We got a flatline.
What's happening? What's happening to him?
I know this is a difficult time for you...
...but it is procedure that I ask just a few questions...
...before we can start processing the policy.
I don't understand. What policy?
Mr. Saunders had a whole-life pension plan through the company.
And with benefits this size, it's standard that I--
What size?
Just a second.
Sorry.
A hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars.
A hundred--?
-Wait, are you saying this goes to us? -To you.
-A hundred and seventy-five-- -What a dear, sweet man.
-A hundred and seventy-five thousand! -A hundred and seventy-five thousand!
A hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars!
-I can't believe he's dead. -Do you think we killed him?
No. Not at all.
Hi! Don't be shy, honey. Nice ass.
-What? He has a cute butt. -You're a slut.
Maybe you should go ask him out, Bonnie.
"I like your butt. Do you wanna have dinner?"
This is nice!
Bedroom, bathroom....
-Hi there. -You look so pretty.
I'm so glad you could come and see our apartment.
"Our apartment." We have an apartment.
It is so big. And look at this view. Look at it.
-It's beautiful. -Oh, look at the couch.
This is our couch. I love this couch.
I saw it in the window and I said, "I have to have this couch."
The guy, what an attitude. I said, "Wrap it up, I'll take it now."
Cash.
My jukebox.
Every song on here is by Connie Francis.
Yeah, isn't that great?
Ever since I was a little girl I said:
All I want in life is a jukebox...
...that plays nothing but Connie Francis records.
That's great.
-Who's Connie Francis? -Oh, shut up, honey. Listen and learn.
Connie Francis--
-Shall we go to my room, girls? -It was nice to see you again.
Connie Francis is--
Wait a minute here....
-Let's have a housewarming party. -Sorry, Mom.
This is cool.
Hey, I was reading and I found something...
...I think you guys might be into.
"Glamour.
Throwing a glamour, an illusion so real as to fool an onlooker...
...is one of the oldest forms of magic."
-I bet you I could do that. -You think?
This is to feel
This is to be
Shape and form it
For all to see
By the power of three times three
As I will it, so shall it be
-What? -My eyes are brown.
They're usually green.
You can do that with contacts.
Yeah, but it's good. I mean, it suits you.
-Subtle, but good. -You want something bigger?
-I want bigger. -Bigger.
Concentrate, come on.
Ready?
-Are you impressed? -Yeah, I'm impressed.
-You look like Loni Anderson. -You wanna touch it?
Yeah.
-It's real. -And simpler than going to a salon.
-Yeah, really. -That's amazing.
Wait, wait, wait. Watch.
-Make me blond. -Me, me.
-No, no. Make me blond. -I don't think so. No way!
-Do something to me. -What do you want?
I want a smaller ass.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Oh, no.
Hey, why didn't you answer the phone?
-It's 3:00 in the morning, Chris. -Oh, yeah. That's a good reason.
Hey, you know what I was thinking?
I was thinking maybe we could move in together.
I don't think I'm ready for that kind of commitment right now.
Oh, shit. Well, it's just that, you know, I can't stop thinking about you.
And I don't know why, but I think I love you.
And I've never loved anyone before, except maybe my mom...
...and this little puppy I had when I was little--
-I think you should go home, Chris. -No, Sarah, wait, please.
Sarah, please, look.
I don't know what's happening to me. I can't eat. I can't sleep.
Can I help you?
No. Nobody can help me.
Here again. What can I do for you today?
We need provisions.
I need to undo a love spell.
When you open a floodgate, how do you undo it?
If you unleash something with a spell, there is no undoing.
It must run its course.
You should let him suffer.
It's not for you to judge suffering.
-What's behind the curtain? -Yeah, what are you doing back there?
Hiding all the missing kids from the neighborhood?
-What's there? Black magic? -True magic is neither black nor white.
It's both because nature is both. Loving and cruel all at the same time.
The only good or bad is in the heart of the witch.
Life keeps a balance on its own. Do you understand?
-Not really. -Well, then, understand this:
Whatever you send out, you get back times three.
-Wait, we didn't read that in any book. -No?
It's part of a basic spiritual truth, said in many ways, in many faiths:
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
I wanna buy this book. You want to invoke the spirit?
You must be experienced to do this. It's very dangerous.
Look, lady, I'm a big girl, okay? Now, please just sell me the book.
-How much? -Twenty-five.
What do you know?
I have money.
When things were the worst for me-- This is before I tried to kill myself.
--I used to hallucinate things.
I'd close my eyes, and all I would see were snakes and bugs everywhere.
And then I'd open them, and they'd still be there. They wouldn't go away.
They're everywhere.
You know, the serpent is a very powerful being.
You should respect it.
Aren't you powerful? Yes, you are.
All right, enough screwing around.
Let's call the corners, shall we?
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the east
Powers of air and invention, hear me!
-Us. -Hear us
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the south
Powers of fire and feeling, hear us!
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the west
Powers of water and intuition, hear us!
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the north
By the powers of mother and earth, hear us
Aid us in our magical working on this May's Eve

Manon! Fill me!
Is he here?
Did you feel that?
He blessed me.
I can feel him running through my veins.
He's still in me.
It's so amazing.
Look at this.
It's so beautiful.
This is a gift.
These are my gifts.
I can feel you in me!
I'm your daughter now.
He's everywhere! He's in everything!
Listen, all I'm saying is I think it's enough already.
I don't know what's going on with this. I'm completely humiliating Chris...
...when all I wanted was for him to like me.
And, Bonnie, what's going on with you? You used to be nice.
Now you're completely narcissistic.
Excuse me, but I spent a big chunk of my life being a monster.
Now that I'm not, I'm having a good time. I'm sorry that bothers you.
Can you guys tell me what color that light is?
It's red.
-Doesn't red mean stop? -Yeah. Red does mean stop.
It's like what Lirio was talking about, throwing things out of balance.
I know you guys think we're getting what we want...
...but it's gonna come back to us threefold.
Are we actually having a theological conversation here?
I mean, it's fun, it's scary. Who gives a shit?
Oh, Nancy, we do.
-What do you guys think? -They don't think.
Bitch.
Stop trying to win them over because it won't work.
I'm not trying to. You're paranoid.
-I'm paranoid? I am not paranoid! -Paranoid.
Will you guys shut up?
Do you want in, or do you wanna leave the circle? Tell me right now.
Why does it always have to be that way? Because that's the way it is.
Because that's the way it is.
All I'm saying is I think you should think.
And I don't want out.
One of these times, the light's not gonna be green, Nancy.
Are we scared, Sarah? Are you scared?
-Nancy! -That was actually pretty close.
It just keeps falling out.
I don't understand this.
What did I do to deserve this?
Laura.
What's the matter? What happened? -I don't know. -It's okay.
I'm gonna go get somebody, okay? Stay right here.
Sarah, come on, please.
I mean, you look like you need to talk to someone anyways.
How do you know what I look like? We're talking on the phone.
It's important, okay? I mean, I just need to be alone with you.
I have to see you. I don't know why but--
Why are you being this way? It's just dinner, come on.
-I don't know. I.... -Please.
-Okay, tomorrow night. -Yes! Yes, yes!
-I'll see you then. -Bye.
So when I started hanging out with them, I was almost relieved.
I didn't have that many close friends in San Francisco.
It just felt really nice to belong.
I disagree with them once and they turn their backs on me.
That's not friendship.
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. You do?
Yeah. You know, sometimes it's like we're one person, you know?
No, I'm not sure.
I'm not sure either. That's so funny. I was just thinking:
"I have no idea what I'm talking about."
Aren't we supposed to go to a restaurant or something like that?
No.
All right. Look, Chris, I know you think you feel really intensely...
...but do you ever stop and wonder where it comes from?
No.
I can't think, I just feel. It's weird how it happened.
I just woke up one day and I couldn't wait to see you.
It's like that every day. But now that I have you, I'm not letting go.
Let's just stop and think about what you're saying here.
You don't even know me.
-Here, I'll give you a backrub. -I don't want a backrub.
-No, it'll be nice. -Chris, I don't want you to. Let go.
-Relax for a second. Turn around. -I think you should take me home.
-No, Sarah, come on. -Take me home.
Well, then just hold me, okay? Hold me first.
Fine, I'll walk.
-Sarah. -No.
Sarah, get back here. Come back here now.
Goddamn it! It's gonna happen. Lie still.
Chris! Chris, don't, please. Let go!
Sarah!
Oh, my God. Sarah, come here.
What happened? Are you okay?
You should have seen the look in his eyes.
It was so weird.
They seemed empty, like it wasn't even him.
Where would he be?
There's a party.
At Trey's.
No, Nancy. Just leave it alone.
Don't go. You're not gonna help anything.
I'm gonna go play.
I can't believe she's here.
-Hey, guys. Nancy Downs is here. -Nancy?
I'm here. You're here. We're all here.
Is Sarah with you?
What's going on?
Where is she?
You and me, we've had some pretty good times together.
If I remember correctly, we had some pretty hot times too.
-Remember? -I've been trying to forget.
Forget?
-Forget this? -Stop.
What's the matter?
Not in the mood?
Not to get my dick bitten off.
What makes you think that's what I wanna do?
Go away.
Go away.
What the--?
-Surprise. -Sarah?
Make love to me, Chris.
-We should not be here. -Neither should Nancy.
Rochelle.
-How's it going? -Fine.
Listen.
You're a witch!
They were right.
They usually are. Nancy, come on. Get off the bed. Let's go.
Nancy, come on. Get off the bed. Let's go.
She's a witch too, you know.
The only reason you're in love with her is because she cast a spell on you.
-No. -Yes. Sad but true.
That's why I'm here. To help you forget about her.
-What do you care? -Nancy, get off the bed.
You scared the shit out of him. Thank you very much. Let's go.
No. He's gotta pay.
You're just jealous.
Jealous?
Jealous?
You don't even exist to me.
You don't even exist.
You are nothing.
You are shit. You don't exist.
The only way you know how to treat women...
...is by treating them like whores when you're the whore!
And that's gonna stop!
Do you understand? Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm sorry.
He's sorry! Oh, he's sorry, he's sorry, he's sorry!
He's sorry! He's sorry! He's sorry!
Sorry, my ass!
No!
I didn't want-- I didn't want him to get hurt.
I liked him.
I think that he was a good guy underneath it all.
-I didn't know it would go this far. -Honey, come on.
I mean, it's hard for you. It was an accident. He fell.
Dad, I need to be alone right now, okay?
-Honey, listen-- -Don't touch me.
Everything I touch turns to shit.
I bind you from doing harm, Nancy
Harm against other people And harm against yourself
I bind you from doing harm, Nancy
Harm against other people And harm against yourself
I bind you from doing harm, Nancy
Harm against other people And harm against yourself
Sarah....
Stop it!
-Stop it! -Sarah!
There you are.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
-Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine.
We heard the police came to your house.
They came to mine too.
Yeah, well, I didn't tell them anything.
Well, then why do you wanna leave the circle?
-I didn't say-- -You don't need to say it.
You're thinking it.
Look, Nancy, people are dead, okay? Chris and Ray--
Those were accidents.
-They deserved it. -Says who?
Says me. And you know it's true.
Fine, whatever. I'm out.
Fine. That's fine.
We don't really need a fourth anymore, do we, girls?
No.
But if you're gonna leave...
...you might wanna think about leaving the school.
And maybe the city too. We're not sure.
Or the planet.
And please don't do any more spells on me.
I didn't.
You know...
...in the old days...
...if a witch betrayed her coven...
...they would kill her.
Bye.
Sweet dreams, Sarah.
How have you been sleeping?
Hello?
Hello!
Yes?
Hello.
-Hi. -What's wrong?
Oh, darling, what's wrong?
Look, I know that I don't know you very well or anything...
...but I-- I just didn't know where else to go.
It's those girls that I always come in here with.
They're trying to use magic against me.
You don't understand. They killed people.
And I tried to do a binding, and it didn't work.
Now it's like they're everywhere I turn.
They're all around me, and no matter what I do, they're still there.
I don't know what to do. You don't understand.
She's inside my dreams.
She knows what's going on inside my head.
She can read my mind.
I'm so sorry. I just didn't have anywhere else to go.
Please.
Come.
What is this?
This temple is built on a place of power.
You have a tremendous light inside you.
More than any witch I've ever known.
-You must not be afraid. -I can't control it.
I always end up hurting somebody.
Do you hear the voice of your mother?
What about her?
She's telling you to be strong. She was a witch too, of course.
Didn't you know? No.
You can defeat those who challenge you.
But you must surrender yourself to the higher power.
-You must invoke the spirit. -But it made Nancy crazy.
She takes it to a dark place.
-Don't be afraid. Invoke him. -I can't.
There is no other way.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the north
It's Nancy. I can't stay here.
Sarah, stop! Sarah!
Hello?
Dad?
Jenny?
Hello?
They're gone. They flew back to San Francisco.
They thought you ran away back home.
Look, Sarah, there's been an accident.
What are you talking about?
What?
It's been all over the news.
Go look at your TV.
Wreckage from the plane was scattered over a one-mile square area.
Authorities suspect wind shear may have been responsible.
The FAA has retrieved the black box. An investigation is pending.
Once again: Global flight 321 from Los Angeles to San Francisco...
...has crashed with no survivors.
More on this story as details become available.
We'll also be going live with Carla Hale and the....
Please stop. Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it!
Gotcha!
God. If I was as pathetic as you are...
...I would have killed myself ages ago. You should get on with it.
Where are my dad and Jenny?
Oh, you'll be seeing them soon enough.
You're going to kill yourself tonight, my dear.
No, I'm not.
Surprise.
No.
Really?
The look in your eyes tells me you might not be so sure.
After all, you have every reason in the world to do it.
I mean, you killed Chris...
...and you killed your mom.
You killed your mom coming out of her. Now, that is really special.
Even I couldn't go that low. Bravo.
Stop it, please!
What's the deal? Why doesn't she use magic on us?
Because she's weak! Weak, weak, weak.
Stop, please.
Oh, God, you're so disgusting.
Now is the end Let her go in peace
Now is the end Let her go in peace
-I didn't write that. -Doesn't matter.
Handwriting still looks the same.
What's wrong with your scars, Sarah?
-It isn't real. -Then why are you still bleeding?
Run! Run back up to your room, like the little coward that you are.
She's so pathetic!
Damn it! Stop!
-Please, somebody help me. -"I'm bleeding."
Please.
What did I do?
Rochelle, go upstairs. See what's going on.
-No. This whole thing, it's just-- -No?
No.
Get your lazy ass up those stairs or I'll slit your throat!
You're as dead as she is.
Come on, I'll go with you. Shit.
Hail to the guardians of the watchtowers of the north
The powers of mother and earth, I invoke thee

Not again!
What happened? Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Hail to the guardian...

Don't be afraid. Reach inside yourself.
Reach inside yourself.

Sarah?
Sarah?
Sarah?
Did I frighten you, Nancy? I'm sorry.
What's going on? Why aren't you dead?
He came to me. Saved me.
Oh, and he wanted me to give you a message:
You're in deep shit.
He says you've abused what he's given you.
And now you're gonna have to pay the price.
-Did he? -He did.
By the way, what happened to Rochelle and Bonnie?
They rushed out of here without even saying goodbye.
It's bad manners.
What's going on? What is going on?
Stop it!
Stop it!
Oh, relax, it's only magic.
Now who's pathetic?
I know I'm a little crazy.
I don't mean to be.
It all got out of hand, and I'm sorry.
No more games, okay?
Sarah, I'm so sorry.
Good.
-I'm gonna go. -One thing first.
I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm
Harm against other people And harm against yourself
-Wait. -I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm
Harm against other people And harm against yourself
-Wait. -I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm
Harm against other people And harm against yourself
I bind you--
I called him first!
You bitch, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
Where are you?
Where are you, Sarah?
Where are you?
Tricky. Tricky, tricky, tricky.
I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm
I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm
-Sarah? -Hi, Sarah. How are you?
Good. Then again, I can sleep at night so....
How are you?
We want to apologize.
-We feel really bad about-- -Trying to kill me?
Yeah.
Honestly, we never thought it would go that far.
Oh, hi, girls. How you doing?
-Hi, Mr. Bailey. -Hi, Mr. Bailey.
You know that thing on TV about the plane crash was just a glamour?
I mean, it was a practical joke.
-Funny. -Sarah, wait.
We were just wondering, do you still have any powers?
Because we don't.
Sorry.
So if you ever want to hang out and chant, or call the corners....
Maybe. Hold your breath until I call.
She probably doesn't have any powers anyway.
Be careful.
You don't wanna end up like Nancy.
It's you. It's you. He did it. He gave me power.
I can do whatever I want now. I can fly!
I can--
He gave you something, honey. But it ain't the power.
But I can fly. I'm flying. I'm flying.
I'm flying. I'm flying.
OK.
OK. YOUR LEG WILL BE FINE. A LOT OF SHRAPNEL CAME OUT.
I SAVED YOU THE PIECES.
YOU ARE THE PRETTIEST GIRL I'VE EVER SEEN.
I DON'T THINK SO. HERE.
WOULD YOU KISS ME?
NO. I'LL GET YOU SOME TEA.
IT'D MEAN SUCH A LOT TO ME.
WOULD IT?
THANK YOU.
NURSE, I CAN'T SLEEP. WOULD YOU KISS ME?
YOU'RE SO PRETTY!
WILL YOU TUCK ME IN, PLEASE?
VERY FUNNY! GO TO SLEEP NOW.
DON'T ASK.
GOD, I HATE GIVING BLOOD. I CAN'T STAND NEEDLES.
IS THERE ANYBODY FROM PICTON?
PICTON? I DON'T KNOW.
I'D LIKE TO SEE SOMEBODY FROM HOME BEFORE I GO.
DO WE HAVE ANYBODY FROM PICTON?
WHY PICTON?
HE'S FROM THERE. EDGE OF LAKE ONTARIO, RIGHT, SOLDIER?
THAT'S WHERE YOUR SWEETIE'S FROM, ISN'T IT? AROUND THERE?
ASK HIM WHAT COMPANY HE'S WITH.
THIRD CANADIAN FUSILIERS.
THIRD CANADIAN FUSILIERS.

NO, SORRY. I THINK I WAS A PILOT.
I WAS FOUND IN THE WRECKAGE OF A PLANE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR.
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR.
CAN YOU REMEMBER WHERE YOU WERE BORN?
AM I BEING INTERROGATED?
YOU SHOULD BE TRYING TO TRICK ME. MAKE ME SPEAK GERMAN,
WHICH I CAN, BY THE WAY. WHY? ARE YOU GERMAN?
WHY? ARE YOU GERMAN?
NO.
HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GERMAN
IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING?
M-MIGHT I HAVE A SIP OF WATER?
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. IT'S OK.
I REMEMBER LOTS OF THINGS.
I REMEMBER HER GARDEN PLUNGING DOWN TO THE SEA,
NOTHING BETWEEN YOU AND FRANCE.
THIS WAS YOUR GARDEN?
OR MY WIFE'S.
YOU WERE MARRIED THEN?
I THINK SO. ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE
I THINK SO. ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE THAT TO BE TRUE OF A NUMBER OF GERMANS.
LOOK...
I HAVE THIS MUCH LUNG.
THE REST OF MY ORGANS ARE PACKING UP.
WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY MATTER IF I'M A TUTANKHAMEN?
I'M A BIT OF...TOAST, MY FRIEND.
SORRY, I CAN'T HELP YOU.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I KNOW YOU HATE TO BE MOVED. I'M SORRY.
HANA! JAN!
JAN!
HANA! HANA!
THERE'S MEANT TO BE LACE IN THE NEXT VILLAGE.

WE KEEP MOVING HIM IN AND OUT OF THE TRUCK. WHY? HE'S DYING. WHAT'S THE POINT?
HE'S DYING. WHAT'S THE POINT? WELL, WE CAN HARDLY LEAVE HIM.

ANYBODY WHO GETS CLOSE TO ME...
OR I MUST BE CURSED.
WHICH IS IT?
WHEN HE DIES, I'LL CATCH UP.
IT'S NOT SAFE HERE. THE WHOLE COUNTRY'S CRAWLING WITH BANDITS
AND GERMANS AND GOD KNOWS WHAT.
IT'S MADNESS. I CAN'T ALLOW IT.
THE WAR IS OVER. HOW CAN IT BE DESERTION? IT'S NOT OVER EVERYWHERE. I DIDN'T MEAN LITERALLY.
IT'S NOT OVER EVERYWHERE. I DIDN'T MEAN LITERALLY.
THIS IS NORMAL. IT'S SHOCK. FOR ALL OF US. HANA--
I NEED MORPHINE. A LOT. AND A PISTOL.
IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED TO YOU, I'D NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF.

YOU'RE WELCOME, MA'AM.
OH, HANA.
I'LL BE OK. I'LL CATCH UP.
GOOD.
WHAT--WHAT WAS ALL THAT BANGING?
WERE YOU--WERE YOU FIGHTING RATS OR THE ENTIRE GERMAN ARMY?
HEH! NO. I WAS REPAIRING THE STAIRS.
I FOUND A LIBRARY,
AND THE BOOKS WERE VERY USEFUL.
BEFORE YOU FIND TOO MANY USES FOR THOSE BOOKS,
YOU MIGHT READ SOME TO ME.
I THINK THEY'RE ALL IN ITALIAN, BUT I'LL LOOK, YES.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR OWN BOOK?
MY BOOK? OH, YES.
THE HEROTODUS. YES, YOU CAN READ HIM.
YES, YOU CAN READ HIM.
OH! I FOUND PLUMS. WE HAVE PLUMS IN THE ORCHARD.

MARVELOUS PLANE. DID YOU LOOK?
YES.
ISN'T IT? IT'S A WEDDING PRESENT
FROM KATHARINE'S PARENTS.
WE'RE CALLING IT RUPERT BEAR.
HELLO. GEOFFREY CLIFTON. ALMASY.
WE CAN FINALLY CONSIGN MY OLD BIRD TO THE SCRAP HEAP.
HEH! MRS. CLIFTON, I'D LIKE TO PRESENT COUNT ALMASY.
HELLO. GEOFFREY GAVE ME YOUR MONOGRAPH
WHEN I WAS READING UP ON THE DESERT. VERY IMPRESSIVE.
THANK YOU.
I WANTED TO MEET THE MAN WHO COULD WRITE
SUCH A LONG PAPER WITH SO FEW ADJECTIVES.
WELL, A THING IS STILL A THING
NO MATTER WHAT YOU PLACE IN FRONT OF IT.
BIG CAR, SLOW CAR,
CHAUFFEUR-DRIVEN CAR. Geoffrey: BROKEN CAR.
STILL A CAR.
NOT MUCH USE, THOUGH.
LOVE? ROMANTIC LOVE,
PLATONIC LOVE, FILIAL LOVE.
QUITE DIFFERENT THINGS, SURELY.
UXORIOUSNESS. THAT'S MY FAVORITE KIND OF LOVE. EXCESSIVE LOVE OF ONE'S WIFE.
EXCESSIVE LOVE OF ONE'S WIFE.
NOW, THERE YOU HAVE ME.
THEY'RE TOURISTS.
ABSOLUTE ROT. THEY'RE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
ABSOLUTE ROT. THEY'RE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY.
SHE'S CHARMING AND HAS READ EVERYTHING.
HE'S MEANT TO BE A RUDDY GOOD FLYER.
WELL, WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER PILOT.
HE CAN MAKE AERIAL MAPS OF THE WHOLE ROUTE. YOU CAN'T EXPLORE FROM THE AIR, MADOX.
YOU CAN'T EXPLORE FROM THE AIR, MADOX. IF YOU COULD EXPLORE FROM THE AIR,
IF YOU COULD EXPLORE FROM THE AIR, LIFE WOULD BE VERY SIMPLE.
CONTACT.
CONTACT.
I SHOULD TRY AND MOVE THE BED.
I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE VIEW.
IT'S GOOD. IT'S THE VIEW FROM A MONASTERY.
I CAN ALREADY SEE.
HOW? HOW CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING?
NO, NO, NOT THE WINDOW. I CAN'T BEAR THE LIGHT, ANYWAY.
I CAN SEE ALL THE WAY TO THE DESERT.
I'M TURNING YOU.
AN EXPLORER BEFORE THE WAR, MAKING MAPS.
IS THERE SAND IN MY EYES?
ARE YOU CLEANING SAND FROM MY EARS?
NO SAND. THAT'S YOUR MORPHINE SPEAKING.
I CAN SEE MY WIFE IN THAT VIEW.
ARE YOU REMEMBERING MORE?
COULD I HAVE A CIGARETTE? ARE YOU CRAZY?
ARE YOU CRAZY?
WHY--WHY ARE YOU SO DETERMINED TO KEEP ME ALIVE?
BECAUSE I'M A NURSE.
Fouad: BRAVO! Katharine: GEOFFREY!
Madox: NEXT! Geoffrey: KATHARINE!
Hana: "THE KING INSISTED THAT HE WOULD FIND "SOME WAY TO PROVE BEYOND DISPUTE
"THAT HIS WIFE WAS FAIREST OF ALL WOMEN.
"I WILL HIDE YOU IN THE ROOM WHERE WE SLEEP, SAID CANDALES-- SAID CONDALESS--" CANDAULES.
CANDAULES. CANDAULES. CANDAULES.
CANDAULES TELLS GYGES THAT THE QUEEN HAS THE SAME PRACTICE EVERY NIGHT.
SHE TAKES OFF HER CLOTHES AND PUTS THEM ON THE CHAIR BY THE DOOR TO HER ROOM.
"AND FROM WHERE YOU STAND, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GAZE ON HER AT YOUR LEISURE."
AND THAT EVENING IT'S EXACTLY AS THE KING HAS TOLD HIM.
SHE GOES TO THE CHAIR, REMOVES HER CLOTHES ONE BY ONE,
UNTIL SHE'S STANDING NAKED IN FULL VIEW OF GYGES.
AND INDEED, SHE WAS MORE LOVELY THAN HE COULD HAVE IMAGINED.
BUT THEN THE QUEEN LOOKED UP,
AND SAW GYGES CONCEALED IN THE SHADOWS.
AND ALTHOUGH SHE SAID NOTHING, SHE SHUDDERED.
AND THE NEXT DAY SHE SENDS FOR GYGES AND CHALLENGED HIM,
AND HEARING HIS STORY, THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID--
OFF WITH HIS HEAD.
SHE SAID, "EITHER YOU MUST SUBMIT TO DEATH "FOR GAZING ON THAT WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT,
"OR ELSE KILL MY HUSBAND WHO HAS SHAMED ME
AND BECOME KING IN HIS PLACE."
SO GYGES KILLS THE KING, MARRIES THE QUEEN,
AND BECOMES RULER OF LYDIA FOR 28 YEARS.
THE END.
SHALL I SPIN THE BOTTLE?
Madox: SO, GEOFFREY, LET THAT BE A LESSON TO YOU.
Geoffrey: HA HA HA! Katharine: D'AGOSTINO.
Hana: ARE YOU ASLEEP?
YES.
NO. I'M DROPPING OFF.
GO AWAY! GO! GO!
BUON GIORNO.
HANA?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I MET YOUR FRIEND MARY.
SHE SAID I SHOULD STOP AND SEE IF YOU WERE ALL RIGHT.
APPARENTLY WE'RE NEIGHBORS.
MY HOUSE IS 2 BLOCKS FROM YOURS IN MONTREAL.
CABOT, NORTH OF LAURIER.
BONJOUR.
FOR YOU. I'D LIKE TO TAKE CREDIT FOR IT,
BUT IT'S FROM MARY.
MY NAME IS DAVID CARAVAGGIO,
BUT NOBODY EVER CALLED ME DAVID.
CARAVAGGIO THEY FIND TOO ABSURD TO MISS OUT ON.
OH! OH, SHIT.
STUPID HANDS.
LET ME DO THAT.
THEY'RE FRESH.
I HAVEN'T HAD AN EGG IN...
HAVE YOU NOTICED THERE ARE CHICKENS?
IN ITALY, YOU GET CHICKENS, BUT NO EGGS.
IN AFRICA THERE'S ALWAYS EGGS, BUT NEVER CHICKENS.
WHO SEPARATED THEM?
YOU WERE IN AFRICA? YES, I WAS.
YES, I WAS.
SO WAS MY PATIENT.
LOOK, I'D LIKE TO STAY FOR A WHILE.
I HAVE TO DO SOME WORK HERE.
I SPEAK THE LANGUAGE. THERE ARE PARTISANS TO BE DISARMED.
WE EMBRACE THEM AND SEE IF WE CAN RELIEVE THEM OF THEIR WEAPONS,
YOU KNOW, WHILE WE HUG.
I WAS A THIEF, SO THE ARMY THOUGHT I'D BE GOOD AT IT.
SO YOU CAN SHOOT A PISTOL.
NO.
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THOSE?
NO.
WELL, I SHOULD LOOK AT THEM BEFORE YOU GO. LOOK, IT'S A BIG PLACE.
LOOK, IT'S A BIG PLACE.
WE NEEDN'T DISTURB EACH OTHER.
I'LL SLEEP IN THE STABLE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE I SLEEP.
I DON'T SLEEP.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MARY TOLD YOU ABOUT ME,
BUT I DON'T NEED COMPANY,
I DON'T NEED TO BE LOOKED AFTER.
THERE'S A MAN DOWNSTAIRS.
HE BROUGHT US EGGS. HE MIGHT STAY.
WHY? CAN HE LAY EGGS?
HE'S CANADIAN.
WHY ARE PEOPLE ALWAYS SO HAPPY WHEN THEY COLLIDE WITH SOMEONE FROM THE SAME PLACE?
WHAT HAPPENED IN MONTREAL WHEN YOU PASSED A MAN IN THE STREET? DID YOU INVITE HIM TO LIVE WITH YOU?
DID YOU INVITE HIM TO LIVE WITH YOU?
HE NEEDN'T DISTURB YOU.
HE CAN'T. I'M ALREADY DISTURBED.
THERE'S A WAR. WHERE YOU COME FROM BECOMES IMPORTANT.
WHY? I HATE THAT IDEA.
THAT'S GONNA WORK. [CHUCKLES]
GENTLY.
OH, IT'S FINISHED.
SO YOU'RE OUR CANADIAN PICKPOCKET.
THIEF, I THINK, IS MORE ACCURATE. I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE IN AFRICA.
I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE IN AFRICA. WHEREABOUTS?
OH...ALL OVER.
ALL OVER?
I KEPT TRYING TO COVER A VERY MODEST PORTION AND STILL FAILED. ARE YOU LEAVING US?
AND STILL FAILED. ARE YOU LEAVING US?
YES.
NOW IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SWAP WAR WOUNDS. OH, THEN I'M DEFINITELY GOING.
OH, THEN I'M DEFINITELY GOING.
DOES SHE HAVE WAR WOUNDS?
I THINK ANYBODY SHE EVER LOVES TENDS TO DIE ON HER.
ARE YOU PLANNING TO BE THE EXCEPTION?
ME? [COUGHS]
I THINK YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG END OF THE STICK, OLD BOY.
SO...
CARAVAGGIO...
HANA THINKS YOU INVENTED YOUR NAME.
AND YOU'VE FORGOTTEN YOURS.
I SAID THAT NO ONE WOULD EVER INVENT SUCH A PREPOSTEROUS NAME.
AND I SAID YOU CAN FORGET EVERYTHING...
BUT YOU NEVER FORGET YOUR NAME.
COUNT ALMASY. THAT NAME MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?
OR KATHARINE CLIFTON?
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY?
OH, HELLO.
THEY DON'T SEE FOREIGN WOMEN IN THIS MARKET. HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY?
HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY? UM...£7, £8, I SUPPOSE.
UM...£7, £8, I SUPPOSE. WHICH STALL?
WHICH STALL?
WHY?
YOU'VE BEEN CHEATED.
OH, DON'T WORRY. WE'LL TAKE IT BACK.
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT BACK. THIS IS NOT WORTH £8, MRS. CLIFTON.
THIS IS NOT WORTH £8, MRS. CLIFTON. IT IS TO ME.
IT IS TO ME.
DID YOU BARGAIN?
I DON'T CARE TO BARGAIN.
WELL, THAT INSULTS THEM.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. I THINK THAT YOU'RE INSULTED BY ME SOMEHOW.
I'D BE VERY HAPPY TO OBTAIN THE CORRECT PRICE FOR THIS.
I APOLOGIZE IF I APPEAR ABRUPT.
I'M RUSTY AT SOCIAL GRACES.
UH, HOW DO YOU FIND CAIRO? DID YOU VISIT THE PYRAMIDS?
EXCUSE ME.
OR THE SPHINX?
LATITUDE: 25.33.
LONGITUDE: 25.16.
WE ATTEMPT TO DRIVE NORTHEAST OF KUFRA, WE LEAVE OUR BONES IN THE DESERT.
I DISAGREE. YOU'RE HUNGARIAN.
GOOD EVENING, GENTLEMEN. GOOD EVENING.
GOOD EVENING.
HOW IS YOUR CHARMING WIFE?
MARVELOUS, SHE, UH... SHE'S IN LOVE WITH THE HOTEL PLUMBING.
SHE'S EITHER IN THE SWIMMING POOL-- SHE SWIMS FOR HOURS. SHE'S A FISH. QUITE INCREDIBLE-- OR SHE'S IN THE BATH.
SHE'S A FISH. QUITE INCREDIBLE-- OR SHE'S IN THE BATH.
ACTUALLY, SHE'S JUST OUTSIDE.
CHAPS ONLY IN THE LONG BAR.
MRS. CLIFTON.
YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE US.
WE'RE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO THE COMPANY OF WOMEN.
NOT AT ALL. I WAS THOROUGHLY ENJOYING MY BOOK.
THE TEAM IS IN MOURNING, DARLING.
OH, REALLY?
I'M AFRAID WE'RE NOT HAVING MUCH LUCK OBTAINING FUNDS FOR THE EXPEDITION.
OH. WELL, WHAT'LL YOU DO?
A MORE MODEST EXPEDITION. OR EVEN WAIT A YEAR.
IT'S A DISASTER. REMIND OUR FAMILIES WE STILL EXIST.
GOOD HEAVENS, ARE YOU MARRIED, MADOX?
VERY MUCH SO. WE ALL ARE...
SAVE MY FRIEND ALMASY HERE.
SAVE MY FRIEND ALMASY HERE. OH, I FEEL MUCH BETTER. DON'T YOU, DARLING?
WE WERE FEELING RATHER SELF-CONSCIOUS.
WELL, LET'S TOAST, THEN. ABSENT WIVES.
ABSENT WIVES. ABSENT WIVES.
AND PRESENT ONES.
AND FUTURE ONES.
THANK YOU.
EXCUSE ME. MAY I?
WHY DID YOU FOLLOW ME YESTERDAY?
I'M SORRY. WHAT?
AFTER THE MARKET, YOU FOLLOWED ME TO THE HOTEL.
I WAS CONCERNED. A WOMAN IN THAT PART OF CAIRO, A EUROPEAN WOMAN... I FELT OBLIGED TO.
YOU FELT OBLIGED TO.
AS THE WIFE OF ONE OF OUR PARTY. SO WHY FOLLOW ME?
SO WHY FOLLOW ME? ESCORT ME, BY ALL MEANS,
BUT FOLLOWING ME IS PREDATORY, ISN'T IT?
COULD I... ASK YOU TO MOVE?
I'M SORRY... BUT I...
OH, I'M SORRY.
OF COURSE.
IT'S JUST WHEN YOU MOVE... HOW STUPID OF ME.
I CAN'T REALLY BEAR THE... MMM, PRESSURE ON THE...
YOU ALL RIGHT? I WAS DREAMING. AWFUL.
HANA.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
LEAVE ME ALONE.
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HIM, AREN'T YOU...
YOUR POOR PATIENT?
YOU THINK HE'S A SAINT BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE LOOKS?
I DON'T THINK HE IS.
I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH HIM. I'M IN LOVE WITH GHOSTS.
SO IS HE. HE'S IN LOVE WITH GHOSTS.
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU HE DID THIS TO ME?
HOW COULD HE HAVE? WHEN?
I'M ONE OF HIS GHOSTS, AND HE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. ASK YOUR SAINT WHO HE IS.
ASK YOUR SAINT WHO HE IS.
ASK HIM WHO HE'S KILLED.
PLEASE DON'T CREEP AROUND THIS HOUSE. SEE, I DON'T THINK HE'S FORGOTTEN ANYTHING.
SEE, I DON'T THINK HE'S FORGOTTEN ANYTHING.
I THINK HE WANTS TO FORGET.
GENTLEMEN... TO MAP MAKING.
All: TO MAP MAKING.
AND A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO GEOFFREY AND KATHARINE, WITHOUT WHOSE FUND-RAISING HEROICS
WITHOUT WHOSE FUND-RAISING HEROICS WE'D STILL BE KICKING OUR HEELS.
TO ARM TWISTING. ARM TWISTING. ARM TWISTING.
DID KATHARINE SAY? GEOFFREY HAS TO FLY BACK TO CAIRO.
RETURN THE FAVOR. TAKE A FEW PHOTOGRAPHS FOR THE ARMY.
UM, WHAT KIND OF PHOTOGRAPHS?
PORTRAITS. THE BRIGADIER... THE BRIGADIER'S WIFE, THE BRIGADIER'S DOG,
THE BRIGADIER'S WIFE, THE BRIGADIER'S DOG, BRIGADIER BY THE PYRAMIDS, BRIGADIER BREATHING.
BRIGADIER BY THE PYRAMIDS, BRIGADIER BREATHING.
AND I SHALL, OF COURSE, BE BEREFT...
BUT FINALLY ABLE TO EXPLORE THE CAIRO NIGHT LIFE.
I SHALL PRODUCE AN AUTHORITATIVE GUIDE TO THE ZINC BARS AND...
I WANT TO SAY, HAREEMS.
AM I IN THE RIGHT COUNTRY FOR HAREEMS?
Madox: HAREM. [MEN CHUCKLE]
BYE, MY LOVE.
BE SAFE.
I'LL CATCH UP IN A WEEK.
CLIFTON. SAFE JOURNEY.
YOU, TOO. GOOD LUCK.
GLAD THE FUNDS HAVE TURNED UP.
CLIFTON.
IT'S PROBABLY NONE OF MY BUSINESS.
YOUR WIFE.
DO YOU THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO LEAVE HER?
APPROPRIATE?
WELL, THE DESERT IS, IT'S, UH... FOR A WOMAN, IT'S VERY TOUGH.
I WONDER IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH FOR HER. ARE YOU MAD? KATHARINE LOVES IT HERE. SHE TOLD ME YESTERDAY.
ARE YOU MAD? KATHARINE LOVES IT HERE. SHE TOLD ME YESTERDAY.
ALL THE SAME, WERE I YOU--
I'VE KNOWN KATHARINE SINCE SHE WAS 3.
WE WERE PRACTICALLY BROTHER AND SISTER BEFORE WE WERE MAN AND WIFE.
I THINK I'D KNOW WHAT IS AND WHAT ISN'T TOO MUCH FOR HER.
I THINK SHE'D KNOW HERSELF.
VERY WELL.
WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE SO THREATENED BY A WOMAN?
I HAVE COME...TO LOVE... THAT LITTLE TAP OF THE FINGERNAIL AGAINST THE...SYRINGE.
TAP.
TAP.
TAP.
STOP PLAYING! PLEASE. STOP PLAYING.
I DON'T HAVE THE KEY TO THAT DOOR. YOU...
THE GERMANS WERE HERE.
THE GERMANS WERE ALL OVER THIS AREA.
THEY LEFT MINES EVERYWHERE.
AND PIANOS WERE THEIR FAVORITE HIDING PLACES.
I SEE. SORRY.
THEN MAYBE YOU'RE SAFE AS LONG AS YOU ONLY PLAY BACH.
HE'S GERMAN.
IS SOMETHING FUNNY?
NO. I'M SORRY.
I'VE MET YOU BEFORE.
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
LOOK. SEE? MOVE THAT... AND NO MORE BACH.
MOVE THAT... AND NO MORE BACH.
LIEUTENANT! YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?
FINE, SERGEANT.
SO YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE ITALIANS?
YEAH, TRYIN' TO GET THEM TO GIVE UP THEIR WEAPONS. I WAS A THIEF, SO THE ARMY THOUGHT I'D BE GOOD AT IT.
I WAS A THIEF, SO THE ARMY THOUGHT I'D BE GOOD AT IT.
OH, I LIKE THE ITALIANS. GRIT.
Hana: HE WANTS US TO MOVE OUT.
HE SAYS THERE COULD BE 50 MORE MINES IN THE BUILDING.
HE THINKS I'M MAD BECAUSE I LAUGH AT HIM.
HE'S INDIAN.
HE WEARS A TURBAN. NO, HE'S SIKH. IF HE WEARS A TURBAN...
NO, HE'S SIKH. IF HE WEARS A TURBAN...
NO, HE'S SIKH. IF HE WEARS A TURBAN... HE'S SIKH.
I'LL PROBABLY MARRY HIM.
REALLY? THAT'S SUDDEN.
MY MOTHER ALWAYS TOLD ME
I WOULD SUMMON MY HUSBAND BY PLAYING THE PIANO.
I LIKED IT BETTER WHEN THERE WERE JUST THE TWO OF US.
WHY? IS HE STAYING?
WITH HIS SERGEANT-- A MR. HARDY.
WE SHOULD CHARGE.
DOESN'T ANYONE... HAVE A JOB TO DO?
THEY HAVE TO CLEAR ALL THE ROADS OF MINES. THAT'S A BIG JOB.
IN THAT CASE, I SUPPOSE WE CAN'T CHARGE.
NO, WE CAN'T.
THANK YOU.
I'VE BEEN THINKING. HOW DOES SOMEONE LIKE YOU
I'VE BEEN THINKING. HOW DOES SOMEONE LIKE YOU DECIDE TO COME TO THE DESERT?
WHAT IS IT? YOU...
YOU'RE--YOU'RE DOING WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR CASTLE
YOU'RE--YOU'RE DOING WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR CASTLE OR WHEREVER IT IS YOU LIVE, AND ONE DAY YOU SAY,
AND ONE DAY YOU SAY, "I HAVE TO GO TO THE DESERT," OR WHAT?
I ONCE TRAVELED WITH A GUIDE WHO WAS TAKING ME TO FAYA.
HE DIDN'T SPEAK FOR 9 HOURS.
AT THE END OF IT, HE POINTED AT THE HORIZON AND SAID, "FAYA."
AT THE HORIZON AND SAID, "FAYA."
THAT WAS A GOOD DAY.
ACTUALLY, YOU SING.
WHAT?
YOU SING... ALL THE TIME.
I DO NOT.
ASK AL AUF.
AL AUF!

WHAT IS IT?
QUICK! COME ON! QUICK!
OH, MY GOD.
THEY'RE SWIMMING.
THEY'RE SWIMMING.
YEAH.
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN... TO SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER BEEN HERE...
FEELINGS... WHICH SEEM QUITE NORMAL?
I DON'T KNOW, MY FRIEND. I DON'T KNOW.
AAH! KAMAL!
BERMANN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
NO! BERMANN!
WATCH OUT! WATCH-- WATCH OUT!
LET ME HELP. ALMASY!
ALMASY! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YES, YES, I'M FINE.
AAAH!
I'LL BE BACK AS QUICK AS I CAN. 36 HOURS AT THE OUTSIDE.
TRY TO GET AN ADDITIONAL RADIATOR.
WE CAN STORE IT BETWEEN HERE AND POTTERY HILL.
AND A BETTER JACK. WE PLANNED BADLY.
BERMANN?
SAFE JOURNEY.
NOW WHAT?
GET ALL THIS STUFF OFF.
I'LL STAY BEHIND. CERTAINLY NOT.
I CAUSED THE PROBLEM. I SHALL STAY.
YOU CAN'T. NONE OF YOU CAN.
NO, I INSIST.
THERE CLEARLY ISN'T ROOM FOR ALL OF US. I'M THE LEAST ABLE TO DIG,
AND I'M NOT ONE OF THE WALKING WOUNDED.
IT'S ONLY ONE NIGHT. BESIDES,
IT'S ONLY ONE NIGHT. BESIDES, IF I REMAIN, IT'S THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD OF PERSUADING MY HUSBAND TO ABANDON
WHATEVER HE'S DOING AND COME AND RESCUE US.
ALL RIGHT. COME ON, LET'S GET GOING.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO PASTE THEM INTO YOUR BOOK.
WELL, WE, UH... WE TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS.
THERE'S NO NEED.
NO, REALLY. I'D LIKE YOU TO HAVE THEM.
WELL, THERE'S REALLY NO NEED. THIS IS, UM...
WELL, THERE'S REALLY NO NEED. THIS IS, UM... THIS IS JUST A SCRAPBOOK. THEY'RE TOO GOOD. I SHOULD...
FEEL OBLIGED. THANK YOU.
AND THAT WOULD BE UNCONSCIONABLE, I SUPPOSE, WOULDN'T IT?
TO FEEL ANY OBLIGATION?
YES, OF COURSE IT WOULD.
YOU SHOULD COME INTO THE SHELTER.
I'M QUITE ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
LOOK OVER THERE.
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?
DO YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM... THE STARS?
THEY'RE SO UNTIDY. I WAS...TRYING TO REARRANGE THEM.
NO, NO. OVER THERE.
IN A FEW MINUTES, THERE'LL BE NO STARS.
THE AIR IS FILLING WITH SAND.
THIS IS NOT VERY GOOD, IS IT?
NO.
WILL WE BE ALL RIGHT?
YES. YES.
ABSOLUTELY.
"YES" IS A COMFORT. "ABSOLUTELY" IS NOT.
Almásy: LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT WINDS.
THERE IS A...A WHIRLWIND FROM THE SOUTHERN MOROCCO...
THE AAJEJ...
AGAINST WHICH THE FELLAHIN DEFEND THEMSELVES WITH KNIVES.
AND THERE IS, UH... THE GHIB LI FROM TUNIS.
THE GHIBLI.
THE GHIBLI...
WHICH ROLLS AND ROLLS AND ROLLS AND PRODUCES, UH...
UM, A RATHER STRANGE NERVOUS CONDITION.
AND THEN THERE IS THE, UH... THE HARMATTAN... A RED WIND...
WHICH MARINERS CALL THE SEA OF DARKNESS.
AND RED SAND FROM THIS WIND HAS FLOWN AS FAR AS THE SOUTH COAST OF ENGLAND,
APPARENTLY PRODUCING... SHOWERS SO DENSE THAT THEY WERE MISTAKEN FOR BLOOD.
FICTION.
WE HAVE A HOUSE ON THAT COAST, AND IT HAS NEVER, NEVER RAINED BLOOD. NO, IT'S ALL TRUE. NEVER.
NO, IT'S ALL TRUE. NEVER. HERODOTUS... [CHUCKLES] YOUR FRIEND... MY FRIEND.
YOUR FRIEND... MY FRIEND. YOUR FR-- [CHUCKLES]
HE WRITES ABOUT IT.
AND HE WRITES ABOUT... A...A WIND... THE SIMOON...
WHICH...A NATION THOUGHT WAS SO EVIL,
THEY DECLARED WAR ON IT AND MARCHED OUT AGAINST IT...
IN FULL BATTLE DRESS...
THEIR SWORDS... RAISED.
KATHARINE. HMM? I NEED TO GET OUT YOUR SIDE, QUICK!
COME ON, LET ME OUT!
OF COURSE. I'M SORRY.
RIDICULOUS TO FALL ASLEEP! UNFORGIVABLE!
DAMN! THE FLARE!
STOP! OVER HERE! [HORN HONKING] HERE!
[HONKING] STOP!
MADOX!
Almásy: MADOX! MADOX!
OUR TRACKS HAVE DISAPPEARED.
MADOX WILL CALCULATE HOW MANY MILES. HE'LL SOON TURN AROUND.
COULD I ASK YOU, PLEASE, TO... PASTE YOUR PAINTINGS INTO MY BOOK?
I--I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM. I SHOULD BE HONORED.
[HORN HONKS, MUFFLED] THE OTHERS!
OH, GOD.
[HORN HONKING] QUICK!
OH, HOW AWFUL. WE'VE GOT TO GET 'EM OUT!
QUICK, GET THE OTHER SHOVEL!
AM I A TERRIBLE COWARD TO ASK HOW MUCH WATER WE HAVE LEFT?
A LITTLE IN OUR CAN. WE HAVE, UH, WATER IN THE RADIATOR,
WHICH CAN BE DRUNK, AND, UH...
IT'S NOT COWARDLY AT ALL. IT'S EXTREMELY PRACTICAL. WE, UH...
WE, UH... OH, COME ON, COME ON.
THERE'S ALSO A PLANT. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT,
BUT I BELIEVE YOU CAN CUT A-- A PIECE THE SIZE OF A HEART FROM THIS PLANT, AND THE NEXT MORNING, IT'LL BE FILLED
AND THE NEXT MORNING, IT'LL BE FILLED WITH A DELICIOUS LIQUID.
FIND THAT PLANT. [BEEP BEEP] CUT OUT ITS HEART.
HERE.
HERE'S THE WINDOW.
CLEAR THE GLASS. I'LL CLEAR THE DOOR.
MIND YOUR HANDS.
IT'S OK. WE'RE HERE.
COME ON. CLEAR IT. QUICK.
HANG ON. WE'RE COMING.
I'VE GOT IT. I'VE GOT IT. [GASPING] HERE. OHHH...
Almásy: KATHARINE!
WATER.
Katharine: GEOFFREY'S NOT IN CAIRO.
HE'S NOT ACTUALLY A BUFFOON.
THE PLANE WASN'T A WEDDING PRESENT. IT BELONGS TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT.
IT BELONGS TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT.
THEY WANT AERIAL MAPS OF THE WHOLE OF NORTH AFRICA.
SO I THINK HE'S IN ETHIOPIA.
IN CASE YOU'RE COUNTING ON HIS SUDDEN APPEARANCE.
AND THE MARRIAGE, IS THAT A FICTION?
NO, THE MARRIAGE ISN'T A FICTION.
OH, THANK GOD. THANK GOD.
MADOX. [CHUCKLES] IT'S MADOX.
AM I "K" IN YOUR BOOK?
I THINK I MUST BE.
Kip: "CHAPTER ONE.
"HE SAT, IN DEFIANCE OF MUNICIPAL ORDERS, ASTRIDE THE GUN ZAM ZAMMAH."
I CAN'T READ THESE WORDS.
I CAN'T READ THEM. THEY STICK IN MY THROAT.
Almásy: BECAUSE YOU'RE READING IT TOO FAST.
Kip: NOT AT ALL.
YOU HAVE TO READ KIPLING SLOWLY.
YOUR EYE IS TOO IMPATIENT. THINK ABOUT THE SPEED OF HIS PEN. WHAT IS IT? "HE SAT," COMMA,
WHAT IS IT? "HE SAT," COMMA,
"IN DEFIANCE OF MUNICIPAL ORDERS," COMMA,
"ASTRIDE THE GUN ZAM ZAMMAH ON HER BRICK--" WHAT IS IT?
"BRICK PLATFORM OPPOSITE THE OLD AJAIB-GHER."
"THE WONDER HOUSE," COMMA,
"AS THE NATIVES CALLED THE LAHORE MUSEUM."
IT'S STILL THERE, THE CANNON, OUTSIDE THE MUSEUM.
IT WAS MADE OF METAL CUPS AND BOWLS TAKEN FROM EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN THE CITY AS TAX,
THEN MELTED DOWN.
THEN LATER THEY FIRED THE CANNON AT MY PEOPLE, COMMA,
THE NATIVES. FULL STOP.
WHAT EXACTLY IS IT YOU OBJECT TO, THE WRITER OR WHAT HE'S WRITING ABOUT?
THE WRITER OR WHAT HE'S WRITING ABOUT?
WHAT I REALLY OBJECT TO, UNCLE,
IS YOUR FINISHING ALL MY CONDENSED MILK.
AND THE MESSAGE EVERYWHERE IN YOUR BOOK, HOWEVER SLOWLY I READ IT,
THAT THE BEST THING FOR INDIA IS TO BE RULED BY THE BRITISH.
HANA, WE HAVE DISCOVERED A SHARED PLEASURE, THE BOY AND I. ARGUING ABOUT BOOKS.
ARGUING ABOUT BOOKS.
CONDENSED MILK.
ONE OF THE TRULY GREAT INVENTIONS.
I'LL GET ANOTHER TIN.
I DIDN'T LIKE THAT BOOK EITHER. IT'S ALL ABOUT MEN.
TOO MANY MEN. JUST LIKE THIS HOUSE.
YOU LIKE HIM, DON'T YOU? YOUR VOICE CHANGES.
NO, I DON'T THINK IT DOES.
ANYWAY, HE'S INDIFFERENT TO ME.
ANYWAY, HE'S INDIFFERENT TO ME. I DON'T THINK IT'S INDIFFERENCE.
HANA WAS JUST TELLING ME YOUR INDIFFERENCE... HEY!
TO HER COOKING.
WELL, I'M INDIFFERENT TO COOKING, NOT HANA'S COOKING IN PARTICULAR.
HAVE EITHER OF YOU TRIED CONDENSED MILK SANDWICHES?
THEY'RE VERY GOOD WITH SALT.
WELCOME BACK, MADAM.
WILL YOU NOT COME IN?
NO. I SHOULD GO HOME.
WILL YOU PLEASE COME IN?
MRS. CLIFTON...
DON'T.
I BELIEVE YOU STILL HAVE MY BOOK.
THANK YOU.
YOU STILL HAVE SAND IN YOUR HAIR.
I'M IMPRESSED YOU CAN SEW.
GOOD.
YOU SEW VERY BADLY.
WELL, YOU DON'T SEW AT ALL.
A WOMAN SHOULD NEVER LEARN TO SEW,
AND IF SHE CAN SHE SHOULDN'T ADMIT TO IT.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
MAKES IT HARDER STILL. [CHUCKLES]
WHEN WERE YOU MOST HAPPY?
NOW.
AND WHEN WERE YOU LEAST HAPPY?
NOW.
WHAT DO YOU LOVE?
WHAT DO I LOVE?
SAY EVERYTHING.
HMM, LET'S SEE.
WATER...
THE FISH IN IT...
AND HEDGEHOGS. I LOVE HEDGEHOGS.
AND WHAT ELSE?
MARMITE. I'M ADDICTED.
AND BATHS, BUT NOT WITH OTHER PEOPLE.
ISLANDS.
AND YOUR HANDWRITING.
I COULD GO ON ALL DAY.
GO ON ALL DAY.
MY HUSBAND.
WHAT DO YOU HATE MOST?
A LIE.
WHAT DO YOU HATE MOST?
OWNERSHIP. BEING OWNED.
WHEN YOU LEAVE, YOU SHOULD FORGET ME.
Hana: WHO IS THIS?
Almásy: DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?
IS IT YOU? [CHUCKLES] SO FAT.
THAT'S A CHRISTMAS CRACKER. A FIRECRACKER.
THIS ISN'T YOUR HANDWRITING, IS IT?
YES, IT IS.
"DECEMBER 22nd.
"BETRAYALS IN WAR
"ARE CHILDLIKE COMPARED "WITH OUR BETRAYALS DURING PEACE.
"NEW LOVERS ARE NERVOUS AND TENDER,
"BUT SMASH EVERYTHING,
FOR THE HEART IS AN ORGAN OF FIRE."
"FOR THE HEART IS AN ORGAN OF FIRE."
I LOVE THAT.
I BELIEVE THAT.
"K."
WHO IS "K"?
"K"... IS FOR KATHARINE.
MERRY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS.
SAY YOU'RE SICK.
WHAT? NO. SAY YOU'RE FEELING FAINT.
SAY YOU'RE FEELING FAINT. THE HEAT.
NO. I CAN'T WORK. I CAN'T SLEEP.
I CAN'T SLEEP. KATHARINE!
I CAN'T SLEEP.
I WAKE UP SHOUTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
GEOFFREY THINKS IT'S THE THING IN THE DESERT, THE TRAUMA.
I CAN STILL TASTE YOU.
PHILLIPA, THIS IS EMPTY.
I TRY TO WRITE WITH YOUR TASTE IN MY MOUTH.
SWOON.
I'LL CATCH YOU.
YOU'RE GONNA MISS ALL THE FUN! OFF WE GO TO SEE MY SLED OUTSIDE!
OFF WE GO TO SEE MY SLED OUTSIDE! HO HO HO! OFF WE GO!
MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE!
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
KATHARINE! OH, MY GOODNESS!
FETCH A CHAIR.
I'M FINE. HOW SILLY. IT'S THIS HEAT. IT'S TERRIBLE. IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
SHE'S QUITE ALL RIGHT. OH, GOOD.
ARE YOU PREGNANT?
I DON'T THINK SO, NO. [LAUGHS] HOW ROMANTIC.
[LAUGHS] HOW ROMANTIC. WITH FIONA, I FELL OVER EVERY 5 MINUTES.
RONNIE CHRISTENED ME LADY DOWNFALL.
DO YOU KNOW I THINK I MIGHT GO INSIDE AND SIT DOWN FOR A FEW MINUTES.
I'LL COME WITH YOU.
NO, I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. YOU STAY HERE.
ARE YOU SURE?
HAPPY CHRISTMAS!
HAVE YOU SEEN KATHARINE? WHAT?
IT'S CLIFTON UNDER HERE.
OH, NO, I HAVEN'T. SORRY.
DARLING, I JUST HEARD.
POOR SAUSAGE. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M FINE. JUST TOO HOT.
I'M FINE. JUST TOO HOT.
LADY H THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE PREGNANT.
I'M NOT PREGNANT. I'M JUST HOT.
TOO HOT. AREN'T YOU?
I'M SWELTERING.
COME ON, I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.
COME ON, I'LL TAKE YOU HOME. CAN WE REALLY GO HOME?
I CAN'T BREATHE.
ARE YOU DYING FOR GREEN, ANYTHING GREEN, OR RAIN?
IT'S CHRISTMAS, AND IT'S ALL--
I DON'T KNOW.
IF YOU ASKED, "MAY I GO HOME TOMORROW?" IF YOU WANTED. DARLING, YOU KNOW WE CAN'T GO HOME.
THERE MIGHT BE A WAR.
OH, GEOFFREY, YOU DO SO LOVE A DISGUISE.
I DO SO LOVE YOU.
WHAT DO YOU SMELL OF?
WHAT?
MARZIPAN. I THINK YOU GOT MARZIPAN IN YOUR HAIR.
NOW WONDER YOU'RE HOMESICK.
IS IT YOU?
WHAT?
IF I SAID MOOSE...
MOOSE? WHO THE HELL'S MOOSE?
I LOOK DIFFERENT. WHY SHOULDN'T YOU?
I HEARD YOUR BREATHING. I THOUGHT IT WAS THE RAIN.
I'M DYING FOR RAIN.
I'M DYING ANYWAY, BUT I--
I'M DYING ANYWAY, BUT I-- I LONG FOR THE RAIN ON MY FACE.
FIRST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? [CHUCKLES] I DON'T KNOW.
[CHUCKLES] I DON'T KNOW. PAPER?
IS IT? I DON'T KNOW.
PAPER. PAPER?
DARLING, IT'S ME.
LISTEN, I'M SORRY. SOMETHING'S COME UP.
Katharine: OH, NO. NOW DON'T SULK. I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW EVENING.
I'M GOING TO SULK,
AND I'M NOT MOVING TILL YOU GET BACK HERE. PROMISE? THAT'S GOOD.
PROMISE? THAT'S GOOD.
OK, MY SAUSAGE. I LOVE YOU.
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GOING ANYWHERE.
I'M NOT. I'M GONNA SURPRISE HER. IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY.
SHE'S FORGOTTEN, OF COURSE.
WHAT THE SYMBOL OF YOUR FIRST ANNIVERSARY?
I SHOULD GET SOMETHING. IS IT COTTON OR PAPER?
FIRST ANNIVERSARY?
WHAT? YOU TWO HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR DONKEY'S YEARS.
BEEN FRIENDS FOR DONKEY'S YEARS.
BEST FRIENDS.
SHE WAS ALWAYS CRYING ON MY SHOULDER ABOUT SOMEBODY.
I FINALLY PERSUADED HER TO SETTLE FOR MY SHOULDER. A STROKE OF GENIUS.
MOOSE, ARE YOU THERE?
YES, GEOFFREY.
FIRST ANNIVERSARY. IS THAT COTTON?
IS THAT COTTON? IS WHAT COTTON?
FIRST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY.
YOUR FIRST ANNIVERSARY IS...PAPER.
STOP.
PLEASE?
ST...STOP HERE.
HERE? JUST STOP RIGHT HERE.
YES, SIR.
WHAT IS THIS?
IT'S A FOLK SONG.
Katharine: ARABIC?
NO, NO, IT'S HUNGARIAN.
MY DAIJK A SANG IT TO ME
WHEN I WAS A CHILD GROWING UP IN BUDAPEST.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?
SZERELE M MEANS LOVE,
AND THE STORY, WELL, THERE'S THIS HUNGARIAN COUNT.
HE'S A WANDERER, HE'S A FOOL,
AND FOR YEARS HE'S ON SOME KIND OF A QUEST
AND FOR YEARS HE'S ON SOME KIND OF A QUEST FOR WHO KNOWS WHAT,
AND THEN ONE DAY HE FALLS UNDER THE SPELL OF A MYSTERIOUS ENGLISHWOMAN,
A HARPY, WHO BEATS HIM AND HITS HIM AND HE BECOMES HER SLAVE.
AND HE SEWS HER CLOAK, HE WORSHIPS--
AND HE SEWS HER CLOAK, HE WORSHIPS-- [LAUGHS] STOP THAT.
[LAUGHS] STOP THAT.
STOP. YOU'RE ALWAYS BEATING ME!
BASTARD! YOU BASTARD. I BELIEVED YOU.
YOU SHOULD BE MY SLAVE.
I CLAIM THIS SHOULDER BLADE.
NO, WAIT, I WANT-- TURN OVER.
I WANT THIS-- THIS--
Laszlo: THIS PLACE.
I LOVE THIS PLACE. WHAT'S IT CALLED?
THIS IS MINE.
I'M GOING TO ASK THE KING PERMISSION TO CALL IT THE ALMASY BOSPORUS.
I THOUGHT WE WERE AGAINST OWNERSHIP?
I CAN STAY TONIGHT.
MADOX KNOWS, I THINK.
HE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT ANNA KARENINA.
I THINK IT'S HIS IDEA OF A MAN-TO-MAN CHAT.
WELL, IT'S MY IDEA OF A MAN-TO-MAN CHAT.
THIS IS A DIFFERENT WORLD, IS WHAT I TELL MYSELF.
A DIFFERENT LIFE.
AND HERE I'M A DIFFERENT WIFE.
YEAH, YOU ARE A DIFFERENT WIFE.
OH, THEY'RE DARLING. WHAT ARE THEY, THIMBLES?
YES. THEY'RE QUITE OLD.
IT'S FULL OF SAFFRON,
JUST IN CASE YOU THINK I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU TO ENCOURAGE YOUR SEWING.
I DON'T CARE TO BARGAIN.
THAT DAY, DID YOU FOLLOW ME TO THE MARKET? YES, OF COURSE.
YES, OF COURSE.
SHALL WE BE ALL RIGHT?
YES. YES.
ABSOLUTELY.
OH, DEAR.
THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER WAKE UP. WHAT?

WHERE DID YOU FIND THAT?
I LIBERATED IT.
I THINK THAT'S CALLED LOOTING.
NO ONE SHOULD OWN MUSIC. THE REAL QUESTION IS,

A TODDLER.
A TODDLER.
MY HAIR WAS LONG AT SOME POINT.
I'D FORGOTTEN WHAT A NUISANCE IT IS TO WASH.
TRY THIS. I FOUND A GREAT JAR OF IT. OLIVE OIL.
OLIVE OIL.
THANK YOU.
IS THIS FOR MY HAIR?
YES, FOR YOUR HAIR.
THERE WAS A GENERAL WHO WORE A PATCH OVER A PERFECTLY GOOD EYE.
THE MEN FOUGHT HARDER FOR HIM.
SOMETIMES I THINK I COULD GET UP AND DANCE.
WHAT'S UNDER YOUR MITTENS?
WHAT'S UNDER YOUR MITTENS?
HE'S WAITING FOR YOU.
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT?
Officer: LOOK, MOOSE, WE NEED YOU TO STAY IN TOBRUK.
I KNOW IT'S A BIT OF A SHORT STRAW.
JERRYS GOT OUR MAPS, YOU KNOW.
AND NOW THEY'RE GETTING THEIR SPIES INTO CAIRO USING OUR MAPS.
THEY'LL GET ROMMEL INTO CAIRO USING OUR MAPS.
THE WHOLE OF THE DESERT'S LIKE A BLOODY BUS ROUTE, AND WE GAVE IT TO THEM!
ANY FOREIGNER WHO TURNED UP, "WELCOME TO THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHIC. TAKE OUR MAPS."
YEAH. OLD MADOX WENT MAD, YOU KNOW. DID YOU KNOW PETER MADOX? YEAH.
MAGNIFICENT EXPLORER.
THANKS, AICHA. AFTER HE'D FOUND OUT HE'D BEEN BETRAYED BY ALMASY, HIS BEST FRIEND.
HIS BEST FRIEND. ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED THE POOR SOD.
German officer: MEIN KOMMANDANT.

Woman, crying: I DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY!
HALT!
Woman: NO! NO!
Officer DAVID CARAVAGGIO.
NO.
THIS WAS TAKEN IN CAIRO AT BRITISH HEADQUARTERS.
JULY '41.
AND SO WAS THIS. AUGUST '41.
AND THIS. FEBRUARY '42.
IT'S POSSIBLE... I WAS BUYING OR SELLING SOMETHING.
I'VE BEEN TO CAIRO MANY TIMES.
YOU ARE A CANADIAN SPY WORKING FOR THE ALLIES. CODE NAME: MOOSE.
Man: JA? ALLO? [SPEAKING GERMAN]
JA?
CAN YOU GET ME A DOCTOR? I'M SICK.
[SPEAKING GERMAN] I'M LEAKING BLOOD.
YOU WANT A DOCTOR? I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR WEEKS, MONTHS. I DON'T KNOW--
WE DON'T HAVE A DOCTOR.
BUT WE DO HAVE A NURSE.
SURE, GREAT. A-- A NURSE WOULD BE GREAT!
LOOK... GIVE ME SOMETHING. A NAME, A CODE,
SO WE CAN ALL GET OUT OF THIS ROOM.
I CAN'T THINK IN THIS HEAT. [FLIES BUZZING] IT'S TOO HOT.
I SLEPT WITH A GIRL.
I'VE GOT A WIFE IN TRIPOLI.
A GIRL COMES UP AND POINTS AT YOU, YOU ONLY SEE TROUBLE.
Maj. Muller: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
THIS IS YOUR NURSE, BY THE WAY. SHE'S MUSLIM,
SO SHE'LL UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS.
WHAT'S THE PUNISHMENT FOR ADULTERY?
LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT.
YOU'RE MARRIED, AND YOU WERE FUCKING ANOTHER WOMAN, SO THAT'S, UH...
IS IT THE HANDS THAT ARE CUT OFF?
OR IS THAT FOR STEALING?
DOES ANYONE KNOW?
WELL, YOU MUST KNOW. YOU WERE BROUGHT UP IN LIBYA, YES? DON'T CUT ME.
DON'T CUT ME.
OR WAS IT TORONTO?
10 FINGERS. HOW ABOUT THIS?
YOU GIVE ME A NAME FOR EVERY FINGER. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO.
I GET SOMETHING. YOU KEEP SOMETHING.
I'M TRYING TO BE REASONABLE. DON'T CUT ME. COME ON!
ARE THUMBS FINGERS?
I GET NO HELP FROM THESE PEOPLE.
TELEPHON, HERR MAJOR. I'M SICK OF THIS ROOM. I'M SICK OF THIS HEAT!
AND I'M SICK OF THIS PHONE!
GENEVA CONVENTION! HEY! COME ON, YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
HEY! COME ON, YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

COME ON! HOW MANY NAMES DID YOU SAY?! AAH! AAH!
OHH! LET ME THINK! JUST LET ME THINK! I CAN'T THINK! I KNOW THEM! PLEASE! LET ME THINK! I PROMISE I'LL--

Caravaggio: THE MAN WHO TOOK MY THUMBS? I FOUND HIM EVENTUALLY.
I KILLED HIM.
THE MAN WHO TOOK MY PHOTOGRAPH? I FOUND HIM, TOO. THAT TOOK ME A YEAR.
I FOUND HIM, TOO. THAT TOOK ME A YEAR.
HE'S DEAD.
ANOTHER MAN SHOWED THE GERMANS A WAY TO GET THEIR SPIES INTO CAIRO.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR HIM.
Madox: YOU CAN'T GET THROUGH THERE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
Almásy: I WAS LOOKING AGAIN AT BELL'S OLD MAPS.
IF WE CAN FIND A WAY THROUGH THE WADI, WE CAN DRIVE STRAIGHT INTO CAIRO,
AND THIS WHOLE SPUR IS A REAL POSSIBILITY.
SO ON THURSDAY YOU DON'T TRUST BELL'S MAP. BELL WAS A FOOL. BELL COULDN'T DRAW A MAP,
BELL WAS A FOOL. BELL COULDN'T DRAW A MAP,
BUT ON FRIDAY HE'S SUDDENLY INFALLIBLE.
AND WHERE ARE THE EXPEDITION MAPS?
IN MY ROOM.
THOSE MAPS BELONG TO HIS MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT.
THEY SHOULDN'T BE LEFT LYING AROUND FOR ANY TOM, DICK, OR HARRY TO HAVE SIGHT OF. SHH.
WHAT ON EARTH'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
DON'T BE SO BLOODY NAIVE! YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR BREAKING OUT!
THIS ARRIVED THIS MORNING. "BY ORDER OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT:
ALL INTERNATIONAL EXPEDITIONS TO BE ABORTED BY MAY 1939."
WHAT DO THEY CARE ABOUT OUR MAPS?
WHAT DO WE FIND IN THE DESERT?
ARROWHEADS, SPEARS.
IN A WAR, IF YOU OWN THE DESERT, YOU OWN NORTH AFRICA.
OWN THE DESERT. [SCOFFS]
UM, MADOX... THAT PLACE...
THAT PLACE AT THE BASE OF A WOMAN'S THROAT...
YOU KNOW, THE HOLLOW, HERE.
DOES IT HAVE AN OFFICIAL NAME?
FOR GOD'S SAKE, MAN, PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.
Newsreel announcer: NOWHERE IS THERE ANY WILD PATRIOTIC EXCITEMENT,
BUT EVERYWHERE THERE IS A DEEP HATRED OF WAR.
THE ANSWER LIES WITH ONE MAN.
AND THE SOLID MASS OF THE CROWDS SURGING ROUND HIS CAR
ARE A SYMBOL OF THE FACT THAT THE BRITISH PEOPLE ARE MORE FIRMLY OF ONE MIND TODAY THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME IN OUR HISTORY.
THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME IN OUR HISTORY.
Newsreel announcer: THERE'S A GREAT TO-DO IN SANDOWN BAY WITH ROWING AND SAILING
AND NO END OF SPORT FOR EVERY WATER BABY.
SORRY.
I CAN'T. I CAN'T DO THIS.
I CAN'T DO THIS.
I CAN'T DO THIS. I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.
I BETTER GO NOW.
SAY GOOD-BYE HERE.
I'M NOT AGREEING.
DON'T THINK I'M AGREEING, BECAUSE I'M NOT.
ANY MINUTE NOW, HE'LL FIND OUT.
WE'LL BARGE INTO SOMEONE. IT WILL KILL HIM.
DON'T GO OVER IT AGAIN, PLEASE.
KATHARINE...
I--
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW, I'M...
I'M NOT MISSING YOU YET.
YOU WILL. YOU WILL.
Almásy: I BELIEVE I'M RATHER LATE.
Madox: GOOD. WE'RE ALL HERE.
A TOAST... TO THE INTERNATIONAL SAND CLUB. MAY IT SOON RESURFACE.
MAY IT SOON RESURFACE.
All: THE INTERNATIONAL SAND CLUB.
Almásy: THE INTERNATIONAL SAND CLUB.
MISFITS, BUGGERS, FASCISTS, AND FOOLS.
GOD BLESS US EVERY ONE.
OOPS! MUSTN'T SAY "INTERNATIONAL." DIRTY WORD. FILTHY WORD.
HIS MAJESTY. DIE FUHRER. IL DUCE.
SORRY, WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
AND THE PEOPLE HERE DON'T WANT US. YOU MUST BE JOKING. THE EGYPTIANS ARE DESPERATE
YOU MUST BE JOKING. THE EGYPTIANS ARE DESPERATE
YOU MUST BE JOKING. THE EGYPTIANS ARE DESPERATE TO GET RID OF THE COLONIALS.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
FOUAD? SOME OF THEIR BEST PEOPLE GETTING DOWN ON THEIR HANDS AND KNEES,
GETTING DOWN ON THEIR HANDS AND KNEES, BEGGING TO BE SPARED A KNIGHTHOOD.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT? MMM? ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SIR RONNIE?
WHAT'S MY POINT? OH, I'VE INVENTED A NEW DANCE!
ANYBODY UP FOR IT? IT'S CALLED-- IT'S CALLED THE BOSPORUS HUG.
MADOX? BERMANN? YOU'LL DANCE WITH ME? MMM?
D'AG. COME ON, D'AGGERS.
D'Agostino: LET'S EAT FIRST. SIT DOWN.
Almásy: ♪ WE'LL BATHE AT BRIGHTON ♪ ♪ THE FISH YOU'LL FRIGHTEN ♪
♪ WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR BATHING SUIT SO THIN ♪ ♪ WE'LL MAKE THE SHELLFISH GRIN ♪
♪ FIN TO FIN ♪ THEY'RE PLAYING IT FAR TOO SLOWLY,
BUT THESE WERE THE WORDS, ACTUALLY, BEFORE THEY WERE CLEANED UP.
MIGHT BE A SONG... FOR YOU, MRS. CLIFTON.
Madox, whispering angrily: EITHER SHUT UP OR GO HOME!
YOU'RE COMPLETELY BLASTED!
SIT DOWN! ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. SHUT UP, SHUT UP!
SORRY. SORRY. I'M SO SORRY.
I CAN'T THINK WHAT CAME OVER ME.
LASHING OF APOLOGIES... ALL AROUND.
THANK YOU. [LAUGHS]
WHY WERE YOU HOLDING HIS COLLAR?
WHAT? [MOCKS] WHAT?
THAT BOY, THAT LITTLE BOY.
YOU WERE HOLDING HIS COLLAR. YOU WERE GRIPPING HIS COLLAR. WHAT FOR?
IS HE NEXT?
YOU'RE GOING TO DRAG HIM INTO YOUR LITTLE ROOM?
WHERE IS IT? IS THIS IT?
DON'T DO THIS. I'VE WATCHED YOU.
I'VE WATCHED YOU AT GARDEN PARTIES,
I'VE WATCHED YOU AT GARDEN PARTIES, ON VERANDAS, AT THE RACES. HOW CAN YOU...
HOW CAN YOU... STAND THERE? PLEASE...
HOW CAN YOU... EVER SMILE AS IF YOUR LIFE HADN'T... CAPSIZED?!
YOU KNOW WHY?
DANCE WITH ME.
NO.
DANCE WITH ME.
I WANT TO TOUCH YOU.
I WANT THE THINGS WHICH ARE MINE, WHICH BELONG TO ME.
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO FEELS ANYTHING?
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?
WHY DON'T YOU GO...
AND GET SOME SLEEP?
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO?
[WHISPERS] Good night.
HANA.
KIP.
Kip: JUST WAIT. DON'T LOOK AT ANYTHING YET.
WAIT.
KIP! [LAUGHS]
[BREATHLESS] OH, THANK YOU!
IF ONE NIGHT I DIDN'T COME TO SEE YOU...
I DIDN'T COME TO SEE YOU...
WHAT WOULD YOU DO? I'D TRY NOT TO EXPECT YOU.
YES, BUT IF IT GOT LATE, AND... I HADN'T SHOWN UP.
THEN I'D THINK, "THERE MUST BE A REASON."
"THERE MUST BE A REASON." YOU WOULDN'T COME TO FIND ME?
HMM. THAT MAKES ME NEVER WANT TO COME HERE.
THEN I TELL MYSELF, "HE SPENDS ALL DAY SEARCHING.
"HE SPENDS ALL DAY SEARCHING. IN THE NIGHT HE WANTS TO BE FOUND."
I DO. I DO WANT YOU TO FIND ME.
I DO WANT TO BE FOUND.
AH. I WAS LOOKING FOR LIEUTENANT SINGH.
HE'S SLEEPING. ONLY, WE BETTER GO TO WORK.
ONLY, WE BETTER GO TO WORK. I'LL TELL HIM.
WHAT IS IT? IS IT A MINE?
IT'S A BOMB, UP BY THE VIADUCT. OHH...

NO! LET ME COME IN!
Almásy: HANA...HANA TELLS ME YOU'RE LEAVING.
Almásy: HANA...HANA TELLS ME YOU'RE LEAVING. Caravaggio: THERE'S GOING TO BE TRIALS.
THEY WANT ME TO INTERPRET.
THEY WANT ME TO INTERPRET. DON'T THEY KNOW I'M ALLERGIC TO COURTROOMS?
SO...
I COME ACROSS THE HOSPITAL CONVOY. I'M LOOKING FOR THIS STUFF.
I'M LOOKING FOR THIS STUFF. THIS NURSE, MARY, TELLS ME ABOUT YOU AND HANA
HIDING IN SOME MONASTERY IN-- WHAT YOU CALL IT? RETREAT?
WHAT YOU CALL IT? RETREAT? HOW YOU CAME OUT OF THE DESERT, AND YOU WERE BURNED,
AND YOU DIDN'T REMEMBER YOUR NAME,
AND YOU DIDN'T REMEMBER YOUR NAME, BUT YOU KNEW THE WORDS
TO EVERY SONG THAT EVER WAS, AND YOU HAD ONE POSSESSION--
A COPY OF HERODOTUS.
AND IT WAS FILLED WITH LETTERS AND CUTTINGS.
THEN I KNEW IT WAS YOU.
ME?
I SAW YOU... WRITING IN THAT BOOK AT THE EMBASSY IN CAIRO...
WHEN I HAD THUMBS AND YOU HAD A FACE...
AND A NAME. I SEE.
BEFORE YOU WENT OVER TO THE GERMANS.
BEFORE YOU WENT OVER TO THE GERMANS. BEFORE YOU FOUND A WAY
TO GET ROMMEL'S SPY ACROSS THE DESERT AND INSIDE BRITISH HEADQUARTERS.
HE TOOK SOME PRETTY GOOD PHOTOGRAPHS.
HE TOOK SOME PRETTY GOOD PHOTOGRAPHS. I SAW MINE IN THAT TORTURE ROOM IN TOBRUK.
IN THAT TORTURE ROOM IN TOBRUK. SO... IT MADE AN IMPRESSION.
IT MADE AN IMPRESSION. I HAD TO GET BACK TO THE DESERT.
I'D MADE A PROMISE. THE REST OF IT MEANT NOTHING TO ME.
THE REST OF IT MEANT NOTHING TO ME. WHAT DID YOU SAY?
THE REST... MEANT NOTHING TO ME.
MEANT NOTHING TO ME. THERE WAS A RESULT TO WHAT YOU DID.
THERE WAS A RESULT TO WHAT YOU DID. IT WASN'T JUST ANOTHER EXPEDITION. IT DID THIS.
IF THE BRITISH HADN'T UNEARTHED THAT PHOTOGRAPHER,
IF THE BRITISH HADN'T UNEARTHED THAT PHOTOGRAPHER, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COULD HAVE DIED.
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COULD HAVE DIED. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DID DIE. JUST DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
YES. LIKE MADOX?
WHAT?
YOU KNOW HE SHOT HIMSELF--
YOUR PARTNER-- WHEN HE FOUND OUT YOU WERE A SPY.
WHAT? KILLED... MADOX THOUGHT I WAS A SPY? NO. NO, I WAS NEVER A SPY.
Madox: IT'S GHASTLY. IT'S LIKE A WITCH HUNT.
IT'S LIKE A WITCH HUNT. ANYBODY REMOTELY FOREIGN IS SUDDENLY A SPY. IT'S A WITCH HUNT.
RIGHT.
WE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT COUNTRIES, DID WE?
WE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT COUNTRIES, DID WE? BRITS, ARABS, HUNGARIANS, GERMANS. NONE OF THAT MATTERED, DID IT?
IT WAS SOMETHING FINER THAN THAT.
YES, IT WAS.
I'LL LEAVE THE PLANE IN KUFRA OASIS.
SO IF YOU NEED IT...
RIGHT. HARD TO KNOW HOW LONG ONE'S TALKING ABOUT.
WE MIGHT ALL BE BACK IN A MONTH OR TWO.
I HAVE TO TEACH MYSELF NOT TO READ TOO MUCH INTO EVERYTHING.
COMES OF TOO LONG HAVING TO READ SO MUCH INTO HARDLY ANYTHING AT ALL.
GOOD-BYE, MY FRIEND.
THERE IS NO GOD.
BUT I HOPE SOMEONE LOOKS AFTER YOU.
IN CASE YOU'RE STILL WONDERING...
THIS IS CALLED A SUPERSTERNAL NOTCH.
COME AND VISIT US IN DORSET WHEN ALL THIS NONSENSE IS OVER.
YOU'LL NEVER COME TO DORSET.
Caravaggio: SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW MADOX SHOT HIMSELF?
NO.
NO.
AND YOU DIDN'T KILL THE CLIFTONS?
NEVER... SHE...
SHE...
SHE'S DONE... SHE...
MAYBE... MAYBE I DID.
Almásy: I WAS PACKING UP OUR BASE CAMP AT THE CAVE OF THE SWIMMERS.
AT THE CAVE OF THE SWIMMERS. CLIFTON OFFERED TO FLY DOWN FROM CAIRO TO COLLECT ME.
TO COLLECT ME. HE FLEW LIKE A MADMAN ALWAYS,
HE FLEW LIKE A MADMAN ALWAYS, SO I TOOK NO NOTICE.
KATHARINE.
DEAR GOD, KATHARINE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? CAN'T GET OUT. CAN'T MOVE.
SURPRISE, HE SAID.
POOR GEOFFREY.
HE KNEW. HE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALL THE TIME.
HE WAS SHOUTING, "I LOVE YOU, KATHARINE. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH."
IS HE BADLY HURT?
I HAVE TO GET YOU OUT.
I HAVE TO GET YOU OUT. PLEASE DON'T MOVE ME.
I HAVE TO GET YOU OUT.
IT HURTS TOO MUCH. MY DARLING, I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
NOW...
WHY DID YOU HATE ME?
WHY DID YOU HATE ME? WHAT?
DON'T YOU KNOW YOU DROVE EVERYBODY MAD?
SHH. DON'T TALK.
YOU SPEAK SO MANY BLOODY LANGUAGES, AND YOU NEVER WANT TO TALK.
YOU'RE WEARING THE THIMBLE.
OF COURSE. YOU IDIOT.
I ALWAYS WEAR IT. I'VE ALWAYS WORN IT.
I'VE ALWAYS WORN IT. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.
IT'S SO COLD.
IT'S SO COLD. I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
I'LL MAKE A FIRE.
DID YOU GET GEOFFREY OUT OF THE PLANE?
YES, I DID.
GOOD. THAT'S GOOD. THANK YOU.
LISTEN TO ME, KATHARINE.
YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR ANKLE, AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TRY AND BIND IT.
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TRY AND BIND IT. I THINK YOU'VE ALSO BROKEN YOUR WRIST...
AND MAYBE SOME RIBS. WHICH IS WHY IT'S HURTING YOU TO BREATHE.
WHICH IS WHY IT'S HURTING YOU TO BREATHE. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO WALK TO EL TAJ.
ALTHOUGH GIVEN... ALL THE TRAFFIC IN THE DESERT THESE DAYS,
I AM BOUND TO... BUMP INTO ONE ARMY OR ANOTHER.
AND THEN I'LL COME BACK, AND YOU'LL BE FINE.
YOU PROMISE?
I WOULDN'T WANT TO DIE HERE. I DON'T WANT TO DIE IN THE DESERT.
I'VE ALWAYS HAD RATHER AN ELABORATE FUNERAL IN MIND.
PARTICULAR HYMNS.
PARTICULAR HYMNS. AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I WANT TO BE BURIED.
IN OUR GARDEN WHERE I GREW UP... WITH A VIEW OF THE SEA.
PROMISE ME YOU'LL COME BACK FOR ME.
I PROMISE... I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU.
I PROMISE... I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU.
YOU HAVE PLENTY OF WATER. AND, UM...FOOD.
I'LL OPEN THEM FOR YOU.
A GOOD READ.
DON'T WASTE THIS.
WOULD YOU BURY GEOFFREY?
I KNOW HE'S DEAD.
I'M SORRY, KATHARINE.
I KNOW.
EVERY NIGHT...
I CUT OUT MY HEART.
BUT IN THE MORNING IT WAS FULL AGAIN.

ALL RIGHT, GO ON, THEN.
HERE, YOU TAKE HIM. I'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN THIS BLOODY TRAIN ALL DAY.
DOESN'T OPEN.
SO, YES... SHE DIED BECAUSE OF ME.
BECAUSE I LOVED HER.
BECAUSE I...
BECAUSE I HAD THE WRONG NAME.
AND YOU NEVER GOT BACK TO THE CAVE?
I DID GET BACK. I KEPT MY PROMISE.
I WAS ASSISTED BY THE GERMANS. THERE WAS A TRADE.
I HAD OUR EXPEDITION MAPS,
AND AFTER THE BRITISH MADE ME THEIR ENEMY,
I GAVE THEIR ENEMY OUR MAPS. GUTEN TAG.
SO I GOT BACK TO THE DESERT AND TO KATHARINE,
AND TO KATHARINE, IN MADOX'S ENGLISH PLANE WITH GERMAN GASOLINE.
WHEN I ARRIVED...
IN ITALY, ON MY MEDICAL CHART THEY WROTE, "ENGLISH PATIENT."
ISN'T THAT FUNNY?
AFTER ALL THAT, I BECAME ENGLISH.
YOU GET TO THE MORNING, AND THE POISON LEAKS AWAY, DOESN'T IT?
BLACK NIGHTS.
I THOUGHT I WOULD KILL YOU.
I THOUGHT I WOULD KILL YOU. YOU CAN'T KILL ME.
I DIED YEARS AGO.
NO, I CAN'T KILL YOU NOW.
WE'VE BEEN POSTED. NOT TO FLORENCE.
I WAS THINKING YESTERDAY... YESTERDAY...
THE PATIENT AND HARDY. THEY'RE EVERYTHING THAT'S GOOD ABOUT ENGLAND.
I COULDN'T EVEN SAY WHAT THAT WAS.
WE DIDN'T EXCHANGE 2 PERSONAL WORDS...
AND WE'D BEEN TOGETHER THROUGH SOME TERRIBLE THINGS.
THROUGH SOME TERRIBLE THINGS. SOME TERRIBLE THINGS.
HE WAS ENGAGED TO A GIRL IN THE VILLAGE.
HE WAS ENGAGED TO A GIRL IN THE VILLAGE. I MEAN... AND US...

I KNOW YOU'LL COME CARRY ME OUT INTO THE PALACE OF WINDS.
THAT'S WHAT I'VE WANTED...
TO WALK IN SUCH A PLACE WITH YOU.
WITH FRIENDS...
AN EARTH WITHOUT MAPS.
"THE LAMP'S GONE OUT.
"THE LAMP'S GONE OUT. I'M WRITING..." IN THE DARKNESS."
Caravaggio: HANA! HANA, COME ON!
Caravaggio: HANA...
THIS IS GIOIA.
THIS IS GIOIA. BUON GIORNO. BUON GIORNO.
There's 25, 30 warriors maybe.
A hundred women and children.
That's it. Here.
Hell, the warriors will turn and fight.
No avoiding that. [Al] Yup.
And give the women and children time to take cover.
[Al] One thing for damn sure they already know we're here.
-Captain Ragsdale. -[Ragsdale] Sir!
Troopers on the flat. Form a line.
-Mr. Ragsdale. -Sir.
Advance carbines.
Company, advance carbines!
Sound the march. Bugler!
[Britton Davis] The Chiricahua Apache from the American Southwest
were the last of the great tribes to defy the United States government,
in its effort to impose the reservation system.
The army, under the command of Brigadier General George Crook,
was entrusted with the responsibility of breaking this resistance.
His campaign into the Chiricahua strongholds below the Mexican border
brought to a conclusion the conflict
that had raged through the southwest for nearly two decades.
Tell Old Nana and the others we're not gonna hurt them.
We're not going anywhere.
We don't want to fight.
We came here to bring you to a reservation.
Tell your men that.
Nantan Lupan only wants peace with the Chiricahua.
Live on the reservation.
[Davis] Only one Chiricahua warrior and his band of renegades held out.
Then even he sent word that he would give himself up in two months' time.
He was called Goyakla.
But, years before, the Mexicans had given him another name,
Geronimo.
[Davis] One month before my 22nd birthday,
I reported for duty in the Arizona territory.
It was my first posting to garrison life.
And looking back, it is now clear to me that I was as much a stranger to myself
as I was to the Great Western desert.
My name is Britton Davis.
I was a participant in what the army later called the Geronimo Campaign.
It is my wish to throw some light
upon the extraordinary events that I witnessed,
and on the men that lived them.
The beginning of my life as a frontier soldier was at hand
and no amount of military training could disguise the excitement I felt.
Howdy. Welcome.
Always good to see an army fella.
Whiskey?
No, thank you, sir.
[chuckles] You don't have to "sir" me, son.
I ain't no officer.
Looks like you are, though. Second Lieutenant Britton Davis
at your service. Proud to know ya.
Where are you from, Lieutenant?
I was born in Texas, near Brownsville.
Texas? Well, son, I thought you was from back east.
Kinda got that manner about ya.
Well, I've been the last four years at West Point.
-Senor? -Yeah.
[Davis] My initial impression of First Lieutenant Charles Gatewood
remains distinct in my memory.
His brusqueness was entirely military, balanced by unfailing good manners.
In his most matter-of-fact way, he gave me my first order as an officer of the United States cavalry.
he gave me my first order as an officer of the United States cavalry.
I was to accompany him south.
We were going to bring in Geronimo.
He's due in a few days.
We'll go on down to the border and escort him to San Carlos.
That's 75 miles to the border from here, Mr. Davis.
Plenty of time to get acquainted with your new mount.
-Sir? -Yes?
Just you and me?
The General figured that with Geronimo with us, we didn't need much protection.
Yes, sir.
A small detachment means we're not threatenin' the hostiles.
You wouldn't want to pose a threat to Geronimo now, would you, Mr. Davis?
No, sir.
[Davis] The lieutenant was clearly a man of confidence
and experience in the Apache wars.
In time, I came to realize he was much admired by his peers,
much respected by his superiors.
[Gatewood] That's the border, Mr. Davis.
How will he find us? [Gatewood] Easy. We're the only ones out here.
Lieutenant?
Apache medicine man.
Probably on a pilgrimage.
The Apaches, they believe in their power. It's a kind of spirit they carry inside them.
It's a kind of spirit they carry inside them.
Sir. Geronimo's just gonna come on in and give himself up?
That's what he promised.
Chiricahua doesn't give his word much. But when he does, he keeps it.
As long as you keep yours.
[Davis] When the medicine man joined our camp, I was filled with curiosity.
By personal inclination, Lieutenant Gatewood kept his own counsel.
However, he met questions from an inexperienced officer
with patience and courtesy.
What fascinated me most
was his sympathy and knowledge of all things pertaining to the Apache.
You don't talk to them much, do you?
To an Apache, stillness is a pleasure.
It's somethin' they're taught while they're young.
Helps them when they may have to hide and wait.
What's he singing about?
Trying to locate Geronimo.
He says he'll be here tomorrow,
on a white horse.
Superstitious, aren't they?
Five dollars says he rides in here on a white horse.
Just because the medicine man says so?
You've got a bet, Lieutenant.
Question.
These scouts that we have with us, they're Apache.
Why would they work for the army? Fight against their own kind?
There are lots of different Apache tribes that don't much like each other.
Most of all, Apache go where the best fight is.
It's a morality once you understand it.
All right, I'll see your two,
and I'll raise you one.
Lieutenant, just curious, are you a family man?
I have a son and a daughter.
They and my wife are back in Virginia.
You must miss them. Every hour of every day.
Goyakla is coming. Rides a white horse.
You owe me five dollars, Mr. Davis.
[in Apache] I heard you were wearing the blue coat.
I did not believe it.
Now I know your heart.
First lieutenant, Charles B. Gatewood.
[in Apache] It is good to see the great warrior.
You speak pretty good Apache.
Second Lieutenant Britton Davis, 6th Cavalry.
[in English] You are now under the protection of the United States Army.
We will escort you to General Crook at San Carlos.
Nantan Lupan waits for you with an open heart.
They are something.
Chiricahua are special.
Even amongst the Apache.
[Davis] The second night of our trek to San Carlos,
we put up at the Overland Way station.
At the foot of the Dragoon Mountains.
The following morning, I had my first opportunity to write home,
being careful to include in the letter an offhand reference to my participation in the capture of Geronimo.
to my participation in the capture of Geronimo.
Two men are coming. Man with white hat carries shotgun.
I'm looking for the officer in charge.
Lieutenant Charles Gatewood, at your service.
I heard the army was traveling through with hostiles.
Especially one hostile in particular.
City Marshal, Joe Hawkins, Tombstone.
Apaches over yonder are under arrest.
I'm deputizin' you two to hold these criminals until we get back
with a posse and a warrant.
These Apache are in our custody.
The warrant's gonna specify the murder of white citizens,
horse thievery, and hostile Indianism. Now, is that good enough for you?
We wanna do what's right. Which is hang 'em. [snickers]
I have orders to turn these Apache in to General Crook.
And the United States Army doesn't need any help from you.
Lieutenant.
Don't sass me, bluecoat.
Great Geronimo.
Well, I think you're nothin' but a murderin' red bastard.
[Gatewood] I'd ride on if I were you, sir.
You seem to have provoked the hostiles.
And I don't think you wanna get into a contest with the 6th Cavalry.
Now, let me tell you somethin'.
Even the 6th Cavalry is subject to a federal warrant.
Justice will be served,
one way or the other.
Toothy.
Get the Apaches going, Mr. Davis.
-Now. -Sir.
[Davis] We moved north with all possible speed,
but our pack mules prevented us from making good progress.
Around 4 o'clock in the afternoon we caught sight of the Tombstone posse.
Faced with a potential enemy that possessed superior numbers,
Lieutenant Gatewood hit upon an unusual tactic.
He divided his forces,
sending me ahead with the others while he and Geronimo remained behind.
The lieutenant had two objectives,
first, to attempt a rear guard protective action.
Second, and most important, never to lose sight of Geronimo.
Easy, steady, steady.
What are you seein', Davy?
Looks like some of 'em split off.
Six or seven of 'em headed to San Carlos.
Other two up yonder.
That's more of a lynch mob than a posse.
But if they serve those warrants, I'm gonna have to give you up.
You have good long glass, Gatewood.
If I scare them off,
we trade.
I can't let you kill any of those men.
That was a great shot.
Not so great. I aimed for his head.
We best catch up to Mr. Davis and the others now.
This your name, Gatewood?
Yes. A gift from my troopers.
They must think you're a fine chief.
No, not a chief, just a soldier.
Your glass... much better than mine.
A blue stone is valuable to Apache.
Well, thank you.
[Davis] The following afternoon we arrived at the military base of operations at San Carlos.
we arrived at the military base of operations at San Carlos.
This afforded me my first glimpse of General Crook,
who the Apache called Nantan Lupan, Grey Wolf Chief.
Our arrival was laid out with great military ceremony.
The surrender of Geronimo was no small event.
General.
My compliments, Lieutenant.
Nantan Lupan. [sighs]
It does my heart good to see you, Geronimo.
I accept your surrender.
I accept the surrender of a great warrior.
Now let's have a cup of coffee and smoke a cigar.
We've got a lot to talk about.
It's old Geronimo.
[in English] Good to see you, ain't it?
You know my friend, Al Sieber.
I was always hopin' to catch up to you myself,
but guess I'll never get that chance now, will I?
Mr. Sieber. Lieutenant.
[Crook] I see you have your cigar and coffee.
Lieutenant Gatewood has reported to me about your trip up from the border.
It sounds like quite a story.
I'm glad to see that Geronimo is a man of his word.
Washington has ordered me to detain you here for a short period.
And then to send you and your band of Chiricahua on to Turkey Creek.
We keep our rifles for hunting.
Yes, but only on the reservation.
I'll put one of my officers in charge there.
Gatewood.
No, I'm sorry, Lieutenant Gatewood is a company officer.
He has his responsibilities here.
We take Davis.
I like Davis.
Well, I'm sure Mr. Davis is gonna make a fine officer,
but I had somebody more experienced in mind.
I like Davis.
What do you think, Lieutenant? Well, I'm sure it will be his privilege,
as well as his duty.
Mr. Davis it is.
To be accompanied by a small detachment of soldiers.
The Apache will be under the protection of the United States Army.
Mr. Davis is young.
Young Apache, young White-Eye, the hope of the west.
Gatewood,
you come visit me.
I would like that.
[Crook] I hope the wars are over, my friend.
Nantan Lupan wants the Chiricahua to learn to be farmers.
It's their only chance.
They must change.
The old days are gone.
Nantan Lupan says there must be no leaving this reservation.
Even for a few hours, without permission.
There must be no drinking of whiskey or tizwin.
Any violations of these rules
will result in confinement in an army prison stockade.
[in English] He want to know why these rules?
Why they be punished?
What you care if Apache drink? Soldier drink.
Nantan Lupan says if Apache drink... ...Apache fight, Apache get into trouble.
...Apache fight, Apache get into trouble.
It's bad for everyone. It's bad for the Apache,
It's bad for everyone. It's bad for the Apache, it's bad for soldiers, bad for all the White-Eyes.
it's bad for soldiers, bad for all the White-Eyes.
[in English] He say why if some Apache do bad things, all are punished?
That will not happen.
All Apache should not be punished for the mistakes of only a few.
We will determine who is responsible and only those few will be punished.
[Davis] Six weeks after I took up residence at Turkey Creek,
Lieutenant Gatewood and Al Sieber came to visit.
Sieber, as chief of scouts, was in charge of recruiting Apache for the Army.
Hello there, Mangas. Just the fella I want to see.
I want you to join the army, all right?
Wolves with bluecoats, scouts to help us fight the renegades.
Now you'll be a sergeant, wear a blue coat, stripes on your coat with army pay, all right?
wear a blue coat, stripes on your coat with army pay, all right?
I don't know, Sieber.
Well, you are a warrior, you hunt men.
You'll make your woman, make your children proud of you.
Mexicans, they take my wife, my little boy.
Well, maybe the army could help get 'em back.
I think maybe I stay here.
If I was asking you out on a raidin' party,
I expect you'd be a lot more willin', hey, Mangas?
[Davis] The federal government had forced over 500 Chiricahua
to take up residence within Turkey Creek's narrow borders.
Corn was the main crop,
but the land was not fertile enough for them to be self-sufficient.
The Chiricahua had become dependent
upon monthly allotments of government supplies for their well-being.
[Geronimo] Gatewood. You come to visit me.
Makes my heart glad to see Geronimo.
How's the life of a farmer?
Some Apaches are good farmer.
Others miss the old way.
I am not good farmer, Gatewood.
I've come here to visit my friend,
but I have some questions I need to ask you.
There are rumors that a medicine man is speakin' against the White-Eye.
That he is callin' for a return to the war trail.
It was told by a medicine man
many more Apache would die fighting White-Eye.
And in the end,
we will win because we will die free of them.
Is the only way for an Apache to be free,
to die?
Well, which medicine man is this? I should talk to him.
Find out what he's saying.
There are many.
Some have the power.
Some just talk.
He's a warrior, every bit born in battle.
Fightin' a lost cause.
I'm familiar with the type.
My two older brothers and my father fought for the army of Northern Virginia.
My oldest brother was killed.
My father was wounded, crippled.
After the war, he took me aside and said, "You'll carry the new flag."
Sent me off to the academy.
First in my family north of the Mason-Dixon line.
So, like our friend, I know what it's like to hate the bluecoat.
[in Apache] Before the White-Eye came we had a good life.
Now we are forced to stay on this tiny piece of land.
The White-Eye do not understand the way of the Apache.
The medicine man at Cibecue is called the Dreamer.
The medicine man at Cibecue is called the Dreamer. He says the dead chiefs will rise.
He say the Apache are the true keepers of the land.
I will go to him.
I want to hear his words.
Today while Gatewood talked to me, I looked into my power.
I saw a white horse running.
I saw the signs of war.
[Davis] Nothing so concentrated the bureaucratic mind in dealing with the Indians
the bureaucratic mind in dealing with the Indians as rumors of the troublesome medicine man.
When an occasional religious leader showed up among the tribes,
preaching doctrines perceived to be dangerous,
standard government policy was to have the army deal with it immediately.
I am here by order of General Crook,
Nantan Lupan.
[in Apache] The dead chiefs will not rise if you are here.
The White-Eye must leave. I pray this will happen.
This dance is a demonstration hostile to the citizens of the United States.
And this demonstration is unlawfully assembled.
I order you to stop at this instant!
Stop that. Stop him. Arrest him.
Watch it!
You didn't have to shoot him, goddamn it! I can handle this myself!
-[soldier] What's he got there? -He had a rock.
He has not done nothin'!
We're not botherin' no one.
You leave here. You leave us alone.
Arrest him. Arrest Geronimo!
[in Apache] Where is your heart?
[Captain] Arrest Geronimo. Arrest him.
-Near Dayton. -Yes, David never really me- General Crook, telegram, sir.
Pardon me.
Get a staff officer to me immediately.
Captain Ragsdale. Now.
General.
Geronimo has jumped Turkey Creek.
The Apache are out.
It all blew up at Cibecue.
The whole damn thing is a shambles.
Geronimo has taken half the reservation with him.
Men, women and children.
Spread the word. All officers to their commands.
Yes, sir.
[Davis] Geronimo had quickly divided his forces into small bands,
each headed for Mexico.
By the day after Cibecue, Crook had five columns in the field.
[Davis] The Geronimo campaign had begun.
[officer] On the point. Circle back!
Sir.
Yes, I see them, Mr. Davis.
Steady in the rank. Go slow.
Beg your pardon, sir.
Do we attack?
Hold the column.
Sergeant.
[Sergeant 1] Steady in the rank. Steady!
Sergeant. [Sergeant 1] Column, halt!
Whatever happens, the Apache will take off.
Don't let the column pursue at speed.
Whenever you can, you choose your ground to fight on.
Chato, what the hell is going on?
Raiding party split off from Goyakla.
Apache challenge Gatewood come out and fight.
Want to show off power to other Chiricahua.
Chato.
Is there anythin' that should be done?
[Davis] Geronimo's band had diverted to the east
into the copper mining country of the low hills.
His tactics were re-supplied at the expense of the civilians
who had settled on Chiricahua land.
[in English] This is Apache land.
This has always been Apache land.
[man] We ain't never done nothin' to you, uh... I mean, it ain't right, is it? [crying]
Stop cryin', damn it!
He's gonna kill you anyway.
We make things out of this country!
There was nothin' here before us, and there'd never be nothin' if we left it to you.
You are a fool!
But at least you are brave.
Get off Apache land.
The next time, I will kill you.
[soldier 1] Detail, halt!
[soldier 2] Troops, right, straight! [soldier 1] Left, right, face!
[Crook reading] "The Apache known as Dandy Jim and Skip Hey
have been found guilty by the military court, department of Arizona,
of insurrection at Cibecue Creek.
The Apache, dead shot,
sergeant, military scouts, 6th Cavalry,
has been found guilty of treason.
The sentence of the court for the three prisoners
is death by hanging."
Do any of you have anything to say to me as Chaplain?
Are any of you Christians?
Nantan Lupan,
I give you my hat.
Maybe you think... my wife, my baby.
[in Apache] Don't trust the White-Eye.
With them, there is no right way.
I am not afraid of their preacher.
The One God will welcome me.
There's three of them.
The driver should be nearby.
They didn't have to kill them just to get their horses.
No, they didn't.
[Davis] Al Sieber had had his wound from Cibecue cauterized with a hot poker,
and was back in the saddle the following day.
All told, he had suffered 17 gunshot and arrow wounds
in his many years of fighting Apache.
The General wants to deploy me and Dutchy to your column.
How's that wound, Mr. Sieber?
Which one?
I got them here, here, here, here.
Hell, I'm in real good. Ain't slowin' me down none. [chuckles]
We came across an overland. four dead, horses gone.
Well, they've burned two spreads off to the west.
They picked up horses, food, a lot of ammunition.
So, I figure I'll just keep trackin' off to those hills there. All right?
All right.
Mr. Davis, you and Sergeant Mulrey stick with Mr. Sieber.
Sir.
Be sure that he gets back to the column by sundown.
[Davis] Sir.
That raiding party is real, real close.
Yeah.
I want you to ride for the column
and bring 'em back to pick up this trail.
-On the double, pronto. Go on. Get outta here. -[man grunting]
You take him! Faster.
[Davis] The hostile Apache that Dutchy and I had been pursuing had gotten away.
Needless to say, at the time I was humiliated.
But much later, I decided the incident had come out for the best.
I'm quite content to go to my grave knowing that I've never killed an Apache.
[Gatewood] You all right, Mr. Sieber?
[Sieber] Caught up with three bucks and a string of stolen ponies.
Gave one of them to Mr. Davis. Seems he got away.
Sergeant Mulrey! Check the area for a dead hostile.
Sir.
Now, we crossing to Mexico tomorrow?
That's right.
I think we ought to send some of them scouts back
'cause I don't trust 'em down south of the border.
Geronimo's got a couple of them spooked, and they're startin' to wonder if they're on the wrong side.
and they're startin' to wonder if they're on the wrong side.
I don't think so, Mr. Sieber.
Besides, we need every scout we have.
Yes, sir.
I guess you weren't there then when they dead shot and the rest of 'em and turned on us at Cibecue.
when they dead shot and the rest of 'em and turned on us at Cibecue.
If I had been at Cibecue, they wouldn't have turned.
Whole thing wouldn't have happened, Al.
I know you don't like me much, Lieutenant. I don't really care.
I know I'm rough in some of my ways, I guess.
I ain't the gentleman type.
But, uh, I think, uh,
compared to you, I am somewhat honest.
No offense intended, Lieutenant. Speakin' off the record, sir.
I just, uh, figure you're a real sad case.
You don't love who you're fightin' for,
and you don't hate who you're fightin' against.
Perhaps, I could learn to hate with the proper vigor from you, Al.
Well, maybe you could, Lieutenant.
[Davis] Though I never managed to become a close friend of Al Sieber,
in the next few weeks of campaigning, I did learn to get along with him.
Only a fool would fail to profit from his vast experience.
I think, in his own way, he was as taken by the Apache as was Lieutenant Gatewood.
Well, sir,
your Apache rides a horse to death and eats him and steals another.
I mean, the horse is just mobile food.
I've chased them when they made 50 miles a day on horse and foot.
And hell, they can live on cactus, go 48 hours without water.
I mean, one week of that would kill your average trooper.
I hear you can track as good as any Apache.
Well, you heard right,
but there's only one of me and a thousand square miles of Apache country.
General Crook figured that out, 'cause it takes an Apache to catch an Apache.
White-Eyes can't catch 'em alone, no, sir.
If you ever get in a fight with Apache, things go bad,
If you ever get in a fight with Apache, things go bad, you save the last bullet for yourself.
You don't wanna get taken alive, no, sir.
They got lots of ways to kill you.
And one of their favorites is to strip you, tie you upside down to a wagon wheel.
They pour pitch on you, light you on fire.
[in Apache] I know you are angry about this war.
The White-Eye...
gave me no choice.
I ask your blessing.
You ask my blessing after this thing is done.
What I did is right.
Now we are fighting
Mexicans and White-Eye.
The reservation is bad, but at least we can stay alive.
We have fought the Mexicans for years...
and the White-Eye will never catch us.
Many Apache will die. I must send for Nantan Lupan.
We will talk with him. I ask that you do this.
[Davis] General Crook and a small detachment of Apache scouts
came across the border into the Canyon de Los Embudos.
Crook had agreed to negotiate terms, but he intended a hard bargain.
For the rest of his life, he never forgave Geronimo for jumping Turkey Creek.
Crook maintained his sympathy for the Apache,
but between he and Geronimo, all trust had vanished.
There is one God looking down on us all.
We are all children of one God.
I didn't come here to listen to religion.
You broke your word.
You left Turkey Creek.
You killed many White-Eye. You come back.
Washington wants you to go to Florida.
You do it or I'll come back with my army and fight.
Nantan Lupan does not understand.
The White-Eye tried to change Apache way.
The Apache were doing fine farming corn.
The problem was Geronimo.
I knew Cochise. He was a king.
He was a wise ruler of his people.
I knew Vittorio. He was a proud leader.
I know Geronimo,
who doesn't want to lead or rule or be wise.
He just wants to fight.
I didn't start this trouble.
The army killed the Dreamer.
He was calling for war.
If the medicine man had come in peaceably, he'd be alive.
There's no excuse for taking up arms against the United States Army.
The army is the best friend the Chiricahua ever had.
You know it and I know it.
With all this land, why is there no room for the Apache?
Why does the White-Eye want all land?
How long in Florida?
Maybe two years. With your families.
I think I can get that.
That's not a bad deal.
A lot of White-Eye want to see Geronimo hanged for murder.
Not murder. War.
Many bad things happen in war.
How many White-Eye did you kill since you left Turkey Creek?
Maybe 50.
Maybe more. How many Apaches did you kill?
You killed women and children.
So did you.
We gain nothing by fighting.
We can live on reservation.
I go there.
You, Nantan Lupan, are like a brother to me.
Many of my people want to surrender.
When I was young,
the White-Eye came and wanted the land of my people.
When their soldiers burnt our villages, we moved to the mountains.
When they took our food, we ate thorns.
When they killed our children,
we had more.
We killed all White-Eye that we could.
We starved and we killed,
but in our hearts we never surrendered.
[Davis] C.S. Fly, a photographer from Tombstone
had requested permission to accompany General Crook to Mexico
and record the negotiations.
Much to everyone's surprise, Crook agreed.
Even more surprising, Geronimo and the other Chiricahua also agreed.
In some mysterious way, they seemed to understand
In some mysterious way, they seemed to understand these pictures would make them immortal.
They remain the only known photographs ever taken of the American Indian
as an enemy in the field.
[in Apache] Old Nana and his people...
will return to Turkey Creek.
Many of his people are too old to fight.
Nantan Lupan will make all of you a prisoner.
We have to trust him.
There is no other way.
I called him my brother.
Go if you must. I have made my decision.
I will not surrender to the White-Eye.
I will stay with you and fight.
But now we will be very few.
"Thereby I tender my resignation as commander of this department.
I have served you well in the past, but my judgment has been called into question.
Without doubt, I made grievous error in trusting the word of Geronimo that he would surrender.
in trusting the word of Geronimo that he would surrender.
Perhaps others will be more correct or more fortunate.
The real tragedy, I know, you do not understand.
That is to the Apache people.
They've lost in me a true friend.
And they have few.
George Crook, Brigadier General, United States Army."
I was forced to send this to Washington a day ago.
They've accepted my resignation
with regrets.
General Nelson Miles will replace me.
There's nothin' to be done, General?
Nothing.
Graceful retirement for a General who could not catch Geronimo.
Settlers, prospectors, land speculators, they won't admit it.
But the truth is they'd all like to see the Indian dead.
They see the army as their weapon.
The army that fight the Apache is the only real hope of keeping the Apache alive.
Only the army can protect them.
Yes, sir.
I fought 'em a long time, General.
And I figure if I was one of 'em, I'd be standin' right next to Geronimo
shootin' at the bluecoats.
But God made me who I am. And between them or us, I figure it's us.
And between them or us, I figure it's us.
Damn it, Al, is that the only way we could win?
Well, I, I can't answer that question. Well, I'm just a hired hand.
I just want to say, General, I didn't always agree with you, but you had my respect.
I didn't always agree with you, but you had my respect.
And while you was in charge,
the army was a proper piece of work.
Yes, sir.
So, I'm gonna quit this damn fool job. I'm gonna go on down to Tucson...
and I'm gonna get drunk.
Take it easy, Al.
Yes, sir.
Al?
[Davis] General Miles brought with him an entirely new staff of line officers.
Lieutenant Gatewood, myself, and many others
had to taste the humiliation of being dismissed from the field.
I'm honored to be here with you men of the 6th Cavalry.
Honored to be here by order of the President of the United States.
We are charged with bringing in the renegade Apache Geronimo.
We will accomplish this task. We will succeed.
But we're abandoning certain practices of the past.
Over-reliance on Apache scouts,
men of divided loyalties.
I will keep troops in the field until the enemy is fully subjugated,
fully pacified.
There will be no compromise with the honor of our nation.
There will be no compromise with the honor of the United States Army.
Captain.
[Davis] As he had promised, General Miles sent troops forward without the Apache scouts.
General Miles sent troops forward without the Apache scouts.
For the next five months they relentlessly searched,
but the results were predictable.
Geronimo and his tiny band of Chiricahua
had vanished deep into the mountains of Mexico.
It seemed they were chasing a spirit more than a man.
[Miles] Lieutenant.
I doubt if you're enjoying your current assignment.
Nothing personal. I understand you're a fine officer.
Do you know why I called you here, Gatewood?
No, sir.
Tomorrow a new policy change will be announced.
As punishment for Geronimo's resistance,
all Chiricahua currently living on reservation land are to be rounded up and sent to Florida.
They will stay there until Geronimo is captured or killed.
That's a harsh penalty that he's drawn on his own people.
I hear you and Geronimo were friendly.
Any relationship I've had has never compromised
Any relationship I've had has never compromised my effectiveness in the field.
I need you to speak freely with me.
Can you find Geronimo? Talk to him?
I thought so once.
There's no way to be sure now.
The signs are that he's starving or close to it.
Living on cactus and rabbits.
I know this because I've got a net of observation points,
and 5,000 troops stretched from here to Sonora,
-searching for-- -Thirty-five Apaches, sir.
That's what I believe he'll be down to in a month's time.
Thirty-five starving Apache.
Beggin' the General's pardon, sir, but why not leave him to the Mexicans?
He can't continue to keep raidin' across the border.
He can't afford to lose any more warriors. He can't replace them.
The present political situation demands results.
I want you to find Geronimo and make him this proposal.
I have the authority to hunt this son of a bitch
all the way to South America if I have to,
but I want this nonsense to end.
Now I'm willing to give you all the scouts you need.
Hundred-man detail, regular cavalry, mule pack team.
A hundred men won't do.
How many do you want?
Three.
I'd like to pick them myself.
Whatever happens, Lieutenant,
this conversation that you and I are having never took place.
Any negotiations with Geronimo are to be strictly confidential. Is that understood?
are to be strictly confidential. Is that understood?
Two years in Florida?
Two years in Florida, with their families.
And when they return to reservation land here in Arizona territory,
every warrior gets 40 acres of land,
two mules.
I don't think you or the government intend to keep this promise.
You just offer it. None of the rest is your concern.
Do you know your scripture, sir?
"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world
and lose his soul?"
Lieutenant...
you have your orders.
[Davis] Lieutenant Gatewood chose the Apache scout, Chato, to accompany him,
as well as myself and Al Sieber, who had become bored with his retirement.
And after four weeks of attempting to track Geronimo
through the mountains of Sonora,
we came across a burning Indian village.
What we found there was unspeakable.
There's two dead women there.
Two little kids.
Scalped 'em all, all four of 'em.
Bounty hunters.
Government down here pays 200 pesos a head for the men, 100 for the women,
and 50 for those kids.
Kill any Indian, then claim they're Apache.
I don't see how any man can sink that low.
Must be Texans. Lowest form of white man there is.
[in Apache] Who are these people?
They are Yaqui, not Apache.
The dying Yaqui told me five White-Eye and a Comanche...
they attacked before dawn.
[in English] Most of the men got away.
They go up into the hills.
They come back one day, maybe two.
They come back for their families,
and build big fire and burn the bodies.
And they go join up with other Yaqui tribe.
Maybe find new wives.
They go off that way, into the hills.
After they hunt Yaqui men, they go to Soyapos...
get their money.
You and Sieber... I want you to track the bounty hunters that did this.
[in Apache] Geronimo is here.
You want me to ride? I'm ready...
You need more rest.
The women have gathered medicine.
Do we leave at dawn?
Don't worry.
We will not fight tomorrow.
Sleep.
[in Apache] I have just seen my power. An iron horse comes over the desert.
I have seen a vision. An iron horse for the Apache.
[Vaquero] Been down here...
almost 20 years.
I was in the war.
Confederate Officer.
After the hostilities ended,
I went to Texas.
Got in a little scrape with the law.
Come down here, got a new name.
New start.
Wife.
Family.
But in my heart...
Well, hell,
I'm still a Tennessee man.
My wife and her sisters,
they trade with Apache women.
They come down from the mountains.
They've done it for years.
A few days back, some Chiricahua showed up near here.
Where?
Straight up Montana Avviripe.
[in English] I didn't expect to see many Americans down here.
Where you fellas from? Texas.
I keep a house in Brewster County.
[Sieber] Awful far from home, ain't ya?
Well, we just came down here, try to make ourselves a livin'.
And what about you, friend?
It seems like you got a real curious nature.
You the law? Me? No, hell, no, no.
I'm just huntin' that son of a bitch Geronimo.
Thought you might've come across somethin' to help me out.
I'm sorry, amigo.
We ain't seen nothin'.
[Schoonover] Apache?
Why don't you sit down here while we have us a drink?
We'll take real good care of you.
Cover my back.
Anythin' happens, fire.
And keep firin'.
Sir.
That Apache is with us.
Don't look like it to me.
[Gatewood] He's a Sergeant of Scouts
in the United States Army.
Who the hell are you?
Charles Gatewood.
Lieutenant, 6th Cavalry.
[Schoonover] You boys are out of uniform.
Maybe he ought to wear one.
Somebody down here take that scalp of his.
Make themselves a little money.
Ten days ago, we came across a Yaqui village.
-All the Indians slaughtered. -[Schoonover] Hmm.
We come across the same type of thing a while back.
I tell ya, this is a crazy country.
$100...
buys that scalp back.
Nice doin' business with you, Mr. Gatewood.
But...
I changed my mind.
You rotten son of a bitch.
Amigo.
Move it, Dixie boy.
God damn.
I never thought I'd get killed tryin' to help save an Apache.
We got 'em, Mr. Sieber.
We got 'em all.
I've been gun-shot, arrow-shot 17 times.
Twenty years... chasin' old Geronimo.
Nothin' I'd love better than being there...
to finish.
You don't have to account yourself to me, Al.
You're a brave man.
I never did have no kind of luck.
Never did.
I'm gonna catch me a little sleep here...
for a minute or two.
[softly] Rotten sons of bitches.
Gatewood, no more burro!
Can't go higher!
[Gatewood] Chato and I...
are goin' on here alone.
You stay with the supplies.
Sir.
Are you giving me a choice?
That's an order, Lieutenant.
I know it's hard to come this far then stop... and I'm sorry.
Somebody's gotta go back and tell the truth.
Britton...
you're a fine officer.
You stay noble.
We're tryin' to make a country here.
It's hard.
[Mangas] Why did you bring him?
He is an enemy to his people.
He thinks you are.
He's a brave man to come here. Enough Chiricahua are dead.
[in Apache] They are dead because the White-Eye killed them.
[in English] Have they taught you to lie, Gatewood?
I don't lie.
But the truth is General Miles will hunt you for 50 years.
He's already sent your families to Florida,
which is far, far away.
Look around.
See how few warriors you have left.
If I kill White-Eyes forever,
I am still Geronimo, an Apache.
Who are you, Gatewood?
Just a man, like you,
and I wanna go home.
I wanna see my family.
My God.
My God is a God of peace.
A God of life and not death.
What does your God say?
Yosin is not here with us on the mountain.
Tell me, what is in your heart?
The war's over.
I offer this
because it has power for me.
Our fight must end here.
When I was young, I took a wife.
We lived in these mountains.
We have our family.
The Mexican soldiers came and they killed her.
They killed her and my two little girls.
They killed them because we are Apache.
I remember when I found their bodies.
I stood until much time had passed, not knowing what to do.
I had no weapon.
But I did not want to fight.
I did not pray.
I did not do anything.
I had no purpose left.
After a year had passed,
my power showed me how to get revenge.
And always since then, I get revenge.
But no matter how many I kill,
I could not bring back my family.
Yosin...
the Apache God is a God of peace.
I gave you the blue stone,
you give me this.
It will be peace.
[Davis] On September 4, 1886,
Geronimo and 34 Chiricahua men, women and children
surrendered to General Nelson Miles.
As he handed over his weapons, Geronimo simply said,
"Once I moved about like the wind, now I surrender. And that is all."
He refused any further conversation with the General.
After arranging Geronimo's final surrender,
Lieutenant Gatewood was immediately transferred
to a remote garrison in Northern Wyoming.
His continued presence would have been an embarrassing reminder
that the United States Army had failed to defeat a band of 35 Apache.
Instead of being rewarded with a medal for his heroic efforts,
Lieutenant Charles Gatewood was sentenced to obscurity.
[officer 1] Sir, formation is ready.
[officer 2] Attention!
[officer 3] Prepare to mount! [officer 2] Present arms!
[officer 3] Mount!
Detail, arms, halt!
"By order of the office of the President of the United States,
all Chiricahua scouts are under arrest
and will be transported to Fort Marion prison,
St. Augustine, Florida,
with the outlaw Apaches led by Goyakla -known as Geronimo." -[officer] Detail, halt!
"The Apache scouts from the White Mountain,
Coyotero, and Mescalero tribes are to return at once to their reservations.
are to return at once to their reservations.
They will remain within these boundaries unless given express permission to travel.
Their duties for the United States Army are at an end.
We thank them for their services."
[officer] Detail, collect arms!
I'm a good Apache. It's just not right.
I'm Sergeant Chato, a scout.
[Davis] Later that afternoon, Geronimo, his band of renegades,
and all the Chiricahua that had served the army so faithfully
were loaded into wagons and transported to the railhead at Holbrook.
There, they were to begin their journey to Florida and imprisonment.
Morning report, sir.
[Davis] Mr. Glenville, I'd like to see the General.
On what business?
[Davis] It's about Mr. Gatewood.
Sir.
I thought the U.S. Army kept its word.
I thought maybe we were the only ones left who did.
What's going on out there is a disgrace.
[Miles] Lieutenant,
you're more worried about keeping your word to a savage
than you are fulfilling your duties to the citizens of this country.
We won. That's what matters.
It's over, Lieutenant.
Geronimo, the Apache, the whole history of the west except being a farmer.
I don't think Mr. Gatewood would want me to be a part of any of this.
I hate an idealist.
There's always something messy about them.
I'm ashamed.
And you have my resignation.
[Davis] To the disappointment of family and friends,
I had ended my military career.
Over the years, the events surrounding the Geronimo campaign
have continued to haunt me.
I carry the memory of those days,
days of bravery and cruelty,
of heroism and deceit,
and I am still faced with an undeniable truth.
A way of life that endured a thousand years was gone.
This desert,
this land that we look out on,
would never be the same.
[in Apache] You were right to fight the White-Eye.
Everything they said to me was a lie.
You helped them...
I will hate you forever.
There are so few of us left...
we should not hate each other.
She has the coughing sickness.
She will die soon.
Maybe the baby, too.
No one knows why the One God
let the White-Eye take our land.
Why did there have to be so many of them?
Why did they have so many guns, so many horses?
For many years, the One God...
made me a warrior.
No gun, no bullets could ever kill me.
That was my power.
Now my time is over.
Now, maybe, the time of our people...
is over.
[Davis] Geronimo lived for another 22 years
as a prisoner of war.
Frank, thank God! I'm dead.
I'm dead.
Frank, I'm sorry. I got lost. This town is so confusing.
What a day. My wife had to work early.
My kid was crying when I took him to school. He hated to leave Chicago.
-It broke my heart, Frank. -Any more excuses?
-No. -Good. In the future be punctual.
-You got it? -I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
-Frank, how are you doing? -It's good to see you again.
-Hi, Marty. Sorry we're late. -Al, go help Jimmy and Raul.
Yeah, sure. This is his.
-You don't trust me? -I live in a crappy neighborhood.
-Have you got that funny money? -Yeah. Right here.
It looks good. It looks real good.
-We're in business. -Excellent.
There's just one problem. This guy Al....
He keeps asking all these questions about my counterfeiter.
My instinct usually tells me when something's wrong.
And there's something wrong. So I had him followed.
He's a Secret Service agent, Frank.
-What do you think I ought to do? -Be sure the body doesn't wash up.
I want you to pop him for me, okay?
-I think maybe you're with him. -You came to me, remember?
-So pop him. Show me I'm an asshole. -I'm just a businessman.
So pop him...
...and let's do some business.
Yes, Frank, that's what I'm looking for.
Come on, let's go get an omelet.
Let me get my pistol.
My gun?
You're under arrest.
You're under arrest, too. Secret Service.
You knew from the weight of the gun that it was empty, right?
There could have been one bullet there.
Hey, Frank.
Do you think we can go someplace and talk about this?
You killed guys before, Frank?
Does it get to you?
It gets to you.
I don't like this undercover stuff. I was so scared.
I joined the Secret Service...
...to protect people.
You like the idea of throwing yourself in front of a gun?
Hoping you get hit instead of the guy you're protecting?
I don't know. Maybe I'm....
-Maybe I'm just wrong for the job. -You're a good man, Al.
-You'll make a good agent. -How do you know?
I know things about people.
-Come on, let's eat. -I've got to go home to my family.
A lot of guys warned me you were a pain in the ass.
-I'll see you in the office. -Damn! The office.
-Monroe wants us to check this out. -I'll take care of it.
-Monroe wants us to check this out. -I'll take care of it. -I'll go with you. -No. Go hug your wife and kid.
-I'll go with you. -No. Go hug your wife and kid.
I was not snooping, but the smoke alarm was going off.
I was not snooping, but the smoke alarm was going off. I got scared.
I got more scared when I saw what was inside.
The smoke was from crumbs in the oven he left on.
Thirty-one years I've been in this country.
I love the United States. I've been to the White House.
Only in the United States can just anybody go to visit the President.
So when I saw this, these killing things...
...I called the police. They called the Secret Service.
That was two days ago.
The President gets 1,400 threats a year. We've got to check them all.
-You say his name's McCauley? -No, McCrawley, from Denver.
I remember it like yesterday. I cried and cried.
Joseph McCrawley, Denver.
Died over 30 years ago, age 11.
Your guy got a duplicate birth certificate... ...then used it to get a driver's license.
-Thanks, Jack. -See you.
Federal Agents. Open up!
Oh, my God! That's you.
-Yeah? -Frank Horrigan?
-Yeah? -The Secret Service agent?
-Yeah. What did I win? -My God, it's really you?
-Who the hell is this? -That was you in my apartment.
-McCrawley? -Why not call me Booth?
-Why not Oswald? -Booth had flair and panache.
The leap to the stage after he shot Lincoln.
-Where are you? -Closer than you'd imagine.
It's very exciting to talk to you. I feel like I know you.
I've read about you and seen photos. You were JFK's favorite agent.
But that was a long time ago. What keeps you going?
Let's get together and talk.
I think the less you know about me, the better.
I think the less you know about me, the better. -I'm planning to kill the President. -You shouldn't have said that.
-I'm planning to kill the President. -You shouldn't have said that.
Threatening the President is a federal offense, even if you don't mean it.
I mean it.
One need only be willing to trade one's own life for the President's.
-That's right. -I'm willing.
Going up against you raises the game to a much higher level.
Fate has brought us together, Frank.
-I just can't get over the irony. -What irony?
Your intimate involvement with the assassinations of two presidents.
Hang on a second. I've got something on the stove.
He was a tenant for three weeks. What's really weird is the other tenants never really saw him.
What's really weird is the other tenants never really saw him.
Statements vary. He was between 5'8" and 6'2".
Statements vary. He was between 5'8" and 6'2". Between 165 and 180 pounds.
-Age? -Between 28 and 45.
Before an election, panic is what you've got on a good day.
-They're waiting for you. -Hey, Frank.
-They're waiting for you. -Hey, Frank. -Sam. -It's been a long time.
-Sam. -It's been a long time. -I hear the new director isn't much fun. -I've been the director for two years.
-I hear the new director isn't much fun. -I've been the director for two years.
Al D'Andrea. You know Matt Wilder.
He still owes me $20 from Super Bowl 21.
This is agent-in-charge Bill Watts and Lilly Raines.
-She's very pretty for a secretary. -And you're very old for an agent.
Lilly's an agent.
I just wanted to see if she had a sense of humor.
Have a seat. Let's talk about this guy.
I guess we're calling him Booth for now.
-What do you know about him? -He's dangerous.
-How do you know? -I know things about people.
Why didn't you take steps to know more that first night?
-We had a busy day. -Too busy to investigate properly?
-A 10-minute search of his room? -I didn't have a warrant.
-Given your reputation-- -What reputation is that?
-Given your reputation-- -What reputation is that? -Let's get back on track. -What are you referring to?
-Let's get back on track. -What are you referring to?
Am I paranoid, or is he busting my balls?
Probably a little of both.
Bill, there was a time around here when I was almost as arrogant as you.
I don't have time for this. I've got to pull 75 agents out of Miami.
Keep me posted, Sam, will you?
-So what do we do with this guy? -We keep investigating.
-Tap my phone. -Will he call again?
-He'll call. He's got panache. -Panache?
-Yes, it means flamboyance. -I know what it means.
-Really? I had to look it up. -All right, we'll tap your phone.
By the way, Watts isn't nearly as arrogant as you were.
Just what reputation was Watts referring to, Sam?
You know.
Is it because I'm considered a borderline burn-out... ...with questionable social skills?
What do you want to talk to me about, besides your reputation?
I want to be assigned to the President.
Protection? After all these years? Frank, you're a dinosaur.
-This guy's gonna make a try. -Watts will fight me all the way.
You owe it to me.
-I've kept you in a job. -I've got to come back.
Do you really want to stand post again? At your age?
Yeah, I've got at least one pair of good shoes somewhere.
We're stopping. Traveler wants to work the ropes.
The French President's coming. Get a security man up here.
Damn it! Get back.
-What's going on here? -Horrigan had a heart attack.
-Hey, are you okay? -Get the hell out of here.
-What's going on? -I had a call about a cardiac case.
-Are you all right, Frank? -I'm on my break here.
I get it, you bastards.
I get it, you bastards. Who's the wise guy?
Okay, everybody, back to work.
-All right, who was the joker? -It may not have been a joke.
-All right, who was the joker? -It may not have been a joke. -You were looking peaked today. -I'll pay him back in spades.
-You were looking peaked today. -I'll pay him back in spades.
How can you be sure it was a him?
-You've missed my street, Al. -Why don't you have a car?
I lived in New York a long time. I like public transportation.
If you like buses, why make me go out of my way?
I like your company.
-He's a weird-looking guy. -If he still looks like that.
Pull up over here.
The President's election troubles were hardly apparent today.
He and the French President stopped twice to greet the crowds.
The Senate has yet to react to the new French trade agreement.
The French will host a formal dinner at their embassy for the President.
Presidential advisors are pleased...
...with the publicity this has brought in an election year.
It's a weird sub-culture, Al. Send some agents to check this out.
-Ask about some wackos. -I'll get on it in the morning.
Hang on, I've got the other line.
-Yeah? -Frank.
-Booth, how are you doing? -I'm fine, thanks.
Hang on, I'll get rid of the other call.
-You got it? -Yeah, keep him talking.
-Yeah? -Trying to trace me?
-Why didn't I think of that? -You did. You're a good adversary.
-But I was worried about you today. -Why?
In the motorcade, I thought you were going to pass out.
You should get in shape for that kind of duty.
-Yeah, maybe you're right. -I'm watching your movie.
-Movie? -November '63. Kennedy's last days.
The arrival in Texas.
It must have been exciting.
Dallas. That morning at Love Field.
You all look so radiant. JFK, Jackie and you.
You look so young and able, Frank.
What did happen to you that day?
The only agent to react to the shots was farther away than you.
You must have looked up at that window, but you didn't react.
Late at night when the demons come...
...do you see the rifle at the window, or Kennedy's head being blown apart?
If you'd reacted in time, could you have saved him?
If you had, that could've been your head being blown apart.
Do you wish you'd succeeded, or is life too precious?
What's done is done.
I have that Esquire article on the tenth anniversary...
...about you and the other agents.
So sad how your wife left you and took your little daughter.
You were so forthright about your drinking problem.
And that you weren't easy to live with.
I was so moved by your honesty.
The world can be a cruel place to an honest man.
What about you, Booth? What's your story?
It's an epic saga.
I'll talk to you again soon. It's nice to have a friend.
-Did you get him? -We got him.
He could have a device that makes it
look like he's using another number.
-This device, how could he get it? -He could build one.
-Can you trace it? -We could run a parity check.
-Can you trace the call? -Not if it's a para-analog line.
Give me a straight answer, or Al will shoot off his foot.
If he calls again, keep him on the line. We'll see what we can do.
You might suggest that the police don't knock down any more doors.
I have that Esquire article
I have that Esquire article about you and the other agents.
about you and the other agents.
So sad how your wife left you and took your little daughter.
You were so forthright about your drinking problem.
You were so forthright about your drinking problem. And that you weren't easy to live with.
I was so moved by your honesty.
-Okay, but why play it for me? -Cancel the President's dinner.
The dinner at the French Embassy? This close to the election?
He manipulated the phone system. He could have knowledge of explosives.
-Do your job. There'll be no problems. -There may be arms in the embassy.
You think the French want to knock off the President?
Why does every chief of staff--
You have no reason to think that this is anything but an idle threat.
You want me to cancel a state dinner and risk offending the French?
This guy's pushed your buttons and you're overreacting a little.
-I'm trying to protect your boss. -So am I.
We're trailing 12 points in the polls, and the election's in six weeks.
-He's got to be seen. -Even if it kills him?
How could being down 12 points look like good news?
The President was even worse off weeks ago.
He'll be out with the voters in the Midwest and then in California.
The President and First Lady of the United States.
His Excellency, the President of France and his wife.
Agent Raines, you look devastating tonight. -Thank you. -Good enough to eat, I might add...
-Thank you. -Good enough to eat, I might add... ...if you'll pardon the expression.
I try to sympathize with you, but you really do annoy me.
Why sympathize?
The tape of that phone call. When he mentioned your wife.
-Ex-wife. -At any rate, I'm sorry.
Strange, I get sympathy from an assassin and a woman I annoy.
-Would you care to dance? -Perhaps some other time.
I get off in a couple of hours.
-What are you looking at? -Where do you hide your firearm?
Don't tell me, let me guess.
We're on our final approach to L.A. It's a beautiful day out there.
Thanks for flying with us. We hope to see you again.
-Deposit this in the new account. -I'll need to see your papers.
"Microspan Corporation." What kind of business are you in?
"Microspan Corporation." What kind of business are you in? -Software. -Up in San Jose?
-Software. -Up in San Jose?
I'm based there, but I'm opening an office in L.A.
You're not from San Jose? Where are you from?
-Minneapolis. -You're kidding! So am I.
Well, it's a small world.
I hated the winters. I used to stay in and pig out.
-What high school did you go to? -New Brighton High School.
-There isn't any New Brighton. -There was when I was there.
Well, maybe I'm just confused. It happens a lot.
-There was a school across from-- -I'm late, will this take long?
Not at all, just another minute.
Thank you.
-You have a very pleasant manner. -Thank you, Mr. Carney.
How would you like to give a colleague a ride home?
-Why do you keep flirting with me? -Am I?
-You know it can't go anywhere. -That's why I do it.
Come on, I'll buy you an ice cream. No further obligations.
Oh, boy.
-How many female agents are there? -About 125.
-Pure window dressing. -Excuse me?
Window dressing. 125 out of 2,000.
You're around so the President looks good to his feminist voters.
-Do make an effort to be obnoxious? -It's a gift.
We do a lot of window dressing. Like running with the limousine.
It'd take an anti-tank missile to put a dent in it.
It'd take an anti-tank missile to put a dent in it. But it makes the President look more presidential.
If I'm here for the feminist vote, what demographics do you represent?
Let's see.
White, piano-playing, heterosexuals over the age of 50.
There ain't a lot of us, but we do have a powerful lobby.
-Time flies when you're annoyed. -Where are you going?
-I have a date. -With whom?
That's none of your business.
-You want a ride? -I don't think so.
I like it here this time of day. I think I'll hang out.
Okay, thanks for the ice cream.
-See you. -You're welcome.
If she looks back, that means she's interested.
Come on now, give me that smug look and be on your way.
Well, Abe.... Damn, I wish I could've been there for you.
Hi, baby, how are you doing?
Yes, I missed you too.
I didn't mean to startle you. I got your address from the phone book.
-I'm not listed. -Well, I better come clean.
-I'm not listed. -Well, I better come clean. I followed you. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at this.
I followed you. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at this.
I'm new in town. I was wondering if you'd care to join me for dinner.
That's sweet, but....
I also wanted to apologize for lying to you about being from Minneapolis.
I shouldn't ask so many questions.
Did you mention our conversation to anyone at the bank?
-No! -May I?
Rory, settle down!
-Pam, what's going on? Oh, hi. -This is my roommate.
-Sally, this is Mr. Carney. -Nice to meet you.
-I was just on my way out. -I'm sorry, but you can't leave.
What?
You shouldn't have been from Minneapolis.
I don't know what you want, but....
-Hi, this is Sally. -This is Pam. We're not in right now.
-Leave your name and number. -And we'll call you back. Bye.
Frank, I hope you don't mind me calling you at the office.
-No, why don't you drop by? -I'd love to.
Let me take some time to welcome those who are joining us late.
I'd love to drop by. We've got so much in common.
We do? Like what?
We do? Like what? We're both willing to trade our lives for the President's.
We were both betrayed by those we trusted.
-I wasn't betrayed, Booth. -Sure you were, Frank.
The Warren Commission reported your procedure as seriously deficient.
They criticized all the agents for being out drinking the night before.
As if Kennedy would be alive today if you'd been in bed by 10 p.m.
-Maybe they were right. -No, they weren't right.
You wanted to have agents stationed all around his car. He refused.
Do you know why? Because he had a death wish.
He talked all the time about being assassinated.
His favorite poem was "I Have a Rendezvous with Death"...
...which is not a good poem, Frank.
I think he wanted to die.
And I think he didn't care that
his death would ruin your life.
What do you think?
Frank?
-What about you? Who betrayed you? -I don't think he's scrambling it.
Some of the same people, but I'm going to get even.
I'll have my day in the sun. The question is, will you?
I'll have my day in the sun. The question is, will you? I think you're in for a lot more pain.
How much of this shit do I have to listen to?
He's across the street. LaFayette Park.
Booth!
I told you to get in shape, Frank.
Is this your current address?
And you didn't see anybody suspicious hanging around that phone booth?
That's him! Al, that's him!
Secret Service! I'm impounding this car. He put his hand on here.
Secret Service! I'm impounding this car. He put his hand on here. -We got fingerprints. -Are you all right, Frank?
-We got fingerprints. -Are you all right, Frank?
Hey Tony, have a look at this.
-The print from Secret Service? -Yeah, it's really strange.
This is C-12. We can't tell them.
Horrigan, I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.
-You're sure? -We ran it against everything.
I'm meeting with the President. You keep investigating.
-What should I do? -You'll think of something.
You're a real pain when things don't go your way.
Your friends warned you about that.
The President hit the campaign trail
today on a 6-day tour of 12 states.
With just a month to the election, he's trailing by 10 points.
He'll concentrate on the Midwest, where he's sagging in the polls.
The campaign will wind up in Chicago with a big rally.
Reservations.
Do you have a flight on Tuesday from Washington to L.A.?
I'd like an open-ended ticket so I can make some stops on my return.
C-5, off-load the choppers first. Who's our route agent?
That'll be Jacqueline King.
This is Watts, we have arrival at 13:15.
-Where are we keeping the cars? -Denver PD has an area for us.
This is Watts, we're ten minutes out.
Here in Denver we gather today in the shadow of giants.
Brave pioneers who overcame the wilderness and carved a new nation.
Today we are asked to match our vision to their vision.
And to pass that legacy on.
-Is sector three secure? -Sector three is secure.
The President was campaigning today in Denver.
We are living in a time of global economic transition.
We need compassion and vision to create a future...
...of peace and progress for everyone.
The President is due to arrive here in L.A. later in the month.
The President is due to arrive here in L.A. later in the month. He'll compete for California's 54 electoral votes.
This is Sandy Riggs calling.
If you want to catch a rally in the Midwest, you'd best call me.
The President has no fixed schedule.
In answer to your other question, just send a check to party headquarters.
Ladies and gentlemen of Holly, Michigan...
...the President of the United States.
We've gone a long way toward achieving that goal....
We've got some trouble up ahead. Notify the White House staff.
Milwaukee will be easy tomorrow.
Flight 318 to Milwaukee is now boarding at Gate 21.
All passengers proceed to the boarding area now.
Checking.
Hey, pal, found any bombs today?
Did the First Lady ask about me?
Have you gotten to know them yet?
-I prefer not to get to know them. -Why is that?
They might not be worth taking a bullet for.
Here comes my replacement. Let's go to the bar.
-We can't drink on the road. -But they have a great piano player.
I've played for presidents and with presidents.
Nixon and I once did a duet of "Moonglow."
-I heard he didn't like you. -We got on all right.
His Chief of Staff didn't like me.
He once ordered me to get rid of some anti-war protesters.
I said I couldn't do that. Freedom of speech and such.
He said, "When I'm talking to you, I am the President."
I said, "You look like a sack of shit in a cheap suit to me, sir!"
-The "sir" was a classy touch. -I thought so.
You never wear shades when you're standing post.
I like the wackos to see the whites of my eyes.
A glare can be just as effective as a gun. Know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
You got me.
You'd better stick to the shades, sweetheart.
What are you afraid of?
I'm afraid of making a big mistake.
Good night.
Good, we've got some updates on Milwaukee.
Thanks.
-Don't answer it. -No. Oh, shit.
Raines.
Okay, I'll be right down.
Traveler's losing ground in Georgia. Milwaukee's out tomorrow.
And they're staging a rally somewhere outside Atlanta.
Damn!
What am I doing?
Oh, Lilly....
I've got to put all that shit back on, damn it!
I'm glad to see you all out here in the rain with me today.
I've been saying, "Don't just vote for me, join me."
And today you certainly have. We may get a tad damp today.
But guess who's gonna be all wet on Election Day?
How about the watch list?
Twenty-three crazies are under surveillance.
The hospital? Extra units of Traveler's blood type are on hand.
Extra units of Traveler's blood type are on hand.
Accessible to the alternate route too.
-Under the weather? -Sick as a dog, Lilly.
What's this? "Psychological Profile of John Booth."
-Did you make a mistake? -What?
You said you were afraid of making a big mistake.
With this job, let's be realistic. It's not like we work in a bank.
-You had an affair with an agent? -He wasn't an agent.
But he left you because you wouldn't quit your job?
But he left you because you wouldn't quit your job? I left him. I wouldn't quit my job for him.
I left him. I wouldn't quit my job for him.
It broke my heart.
You vowed never again to let a man come between you and your career.
But now you're in love with me and it scares you a little, doesn't it?
-Blow your nose. -Sorry.
What would happen if I gave up my job for you?
Why would you do that?
I vowed never again to let my career come between me and a woman.
Frank....
-Hey, be careful, will you? -Yeah?
This whole event's been advertised in advance. Just be alert.
Watts, it's Horrigan, it's a zoo here. We gotta take Traveler underground.
This is Watts. We are using the alternate arrival site. Underground.
-Watts, Booth may be here. -I thought you couldn't identify him.
-I can't. Just call it a hunch. -Ignore your psychic abilities.
All posts take to your positions.
-You've got a fever, Frank. -You stay alert in there, will you?
One quality above all marks this President.
It has earned him the respect of the people of this country.
That quality is courage.
The question is, will we stand
The question is, will we stand by the man who has stood by us?
by the man who has stood by us?
-Stage right? -Stage right, all clear.
-Stage left? -Stage left, clear.
-Stage center? -Stage center, clear.
The President of the United States and the First Lady!
-Gun! -Get down!
What the hell's going on in there?
All clear.
-False alarm. -Traveler's secure. Resume positions.
-Are you hurt, Mr. President? -I'm all right.
Everything's all right, folks.
Everything's all right, folks. We had a little false alarm there.
We had a little false alarm there.
That was exciting, wasn't it? Take your seat, please.
It was just a balloon popping. Traveler wants to continue.
Do you have any idea how many votes you cost us last night?
The President looked like a coward.
He looked all right. You were the one who looked like a coward.
-Is this just a joke to you? -No, you're a joke to me.
-You have no idea what we do. -That's enough!
I'll have you busting counterfeiters in Alaska!
Keep him away from the White House and away from me!
-The man's a disgrace. -You can't talk to him like that.
I don't work for him. You work for me. At least you did. You're off my detail.
You work for me. At least you did. You're off my detail.
My Super Bowl debt. In case I don't see you after this trip.
You know, Frank...
...if you just acknowledge that it was an unfortunate situation--
...if you just acknowledge that it was an unfortunate situation-- -I'm not going to apologize. -I'm not saying you should.
-I'm not going to apologize. -I'm not saying you should.
-But the President was humiliated. -He's alive.
-We are here to save his dignity too. -I'm not paid for that.
When Kennedy's girlfriend got into trouble, you said she was with you.
-That was just a rumor. -I heard the whole story.
You were suspended for a month in order to save his dignity.
-He was different. -Maybe you were different.
I was different. The whole country was different.
Everything would be different if I'd been half as paranoid as I am today.
Frank....
Why not just retire? Live off your pension. What's the point?
Somebody else asked me that not long ago.
You don't spend any money, except on jazz records.
I want to stay on the Booth case, Sam.
All right, but as for protective detail--
All right, but as for protective detail-- I understand.
That thing in Chicago....
I've never been on the wrong side of a judgment call like that.
You had the flu! That can impair your judgment.
Face it, Frank. You're too old for this shit.
Hello.
What happened in the Windy City, Frank?
Booth?
-Did the balloon get you panicky? -You were there.
Yes, yes.
I couldn't help wondering why you'd
I couldn't help wondering why you'd risk your life to save such a man.
You have such a strange job. I can't decide if it's heroic or absurd.
Why would you risk your life to kill a man like that?
-Read my psychological profile. -I don't believe in them.
Nor do I. A man's actions don't equal the sum of his psychological parts.
Nor do I. A man's actions don't equal the sum of his psychological parts. -It doesn't work that way. -Just how does it work?
-It doesn't work that way. -Just how does it work?
It doesn't work. God doesn't punish the wicked and reward the righteous.
Everyone dies. Some die because they deserve to.
Others die because they come from Minneapolis. It's meaningless.
If none of this means anything, why kill the President?
-To punctuate the dreariness. -You need to get yourself laid.
You're the same. Name one thing in your life that has any meaning.
-I play the piano. -That's not enough.
How do you know? Do you play?
I've seen you in your bar alone.
There's no cause worth fighting for. All we have is the game.
-I'm on offense. You're on defense. -When do we start playing the game?
The clock's ticking, Frank. Take care.
The clock's ticking, Frank. Take care. Wait. Wait, Booth.
He scrambled it. I missed him.
Fuck!
Fucker.
Jesus, Frank.
I called for hours. I thought something happened to you.
I'm sick, I'm tired and I'm armed, too. So be careful.
-You're also maybe a genius. -Not to be recognized in this lifetime.
-Did you listen to the call? -Yeah, remember--?
-Did you listen to the call? -Yeah, remember--? Call the field office in Minneapolis.
See what you can find about accidental deaths.
Frank! Will you listen to me, please?
Frank! Will you listen to me, please? -Spit it out, damn it! -We spoke to some model builders.
-Spit it out, damn it! -We spoke to some model builders.
There is a professor at Pasadena College.
I think we've got something.
I met him at a design conference in New Orleans a year ago.
We ordered a few rounds of drinks. He seemed like a nice enough guy.
But when we talked politics he got a nasty edge.
He said the government betrayed him and he was out for revenge.
The way he said it scared me.
I said, "Nice talking to you." And I got the hell out of there.
For the life of me I cannot remember his name.
But I'm pretty sure he said he was from Phoenix.
You ought to talk to a guy in Phoenix named Walter Wickland.
-We're going to Phoenix. -Let's get a police artist.
-Have a sketch faxed to us. -You figured that out by yourself?
-Kiss my ass, Frank. -I told you you'd make a good agent.
That doesn't look much like him, but it's got to be Mitch Leary.
-I haven't seen him in over a year. -What do you know about the guy?
You see this wheelchair? Mitch bought it for me.
You see this wheelchair? Mitch bought it for me. It cost over $1,000.
-You see this? -Take it easy now.
This is in case he ever comes back.
He accused me of ripping off his design.
He said my penalty for disloyalty was death.
If you put him away, I'll sleep better.
-Where can we find him? -I've got his address somewhere.
Don't move.
Drop it!
-Let him go, Horrigan. -I got him.
It's okay. We're on the same team.
-Hands, motherfucker! -I'm getting my identification!
-Give it to me. -David Coppinger. CIA.
-And who's this asshole? -He's with me.
-Goddamn it! -Are you here for Leary or me?
Mr. Leary used to be one of our operatives.
-He's threatened to kill the President. -We didn't think he was serious.
-But you knew. You and the FBI. -I understand your frustration.
You understand my frustration? You pompous son of a bitch!
What did Leary do for you? Run drugs? Sell arms to Iran?
It's a C-12 matter, so this is off the record.
It's a C-12 matter, so this is off the record. If asked, I'm going to deny it.
-Leary's what we call a wet boy. -What's a wet boy, Frank?
Leary's an assassin.
Leary's an assassin. He's more like a predator.
He's more like a predator.
-Was that you shooting? -Yes.
-What kind of gun is that? -Something I made.
You made it? That beats paying for it.
-Can I see it? -Yeah.
-It's light. What's it made of? -It's composite. Like plastic.
Pretty neat! Mind if I give her a little dance?
-Not at all. -Go for it.
That is great! That is really great!
-Would you sell it? -No, I need it.
-For what? -To assassinate the President.
-Why would you want to do that for? -Why did you kill that bird, asshole?
Leary was one of our most effective contractors, but times changed.
Cutbacks had to be made. Leary didn't take it too well.
-We've not been able to locate him. -We can work together on this.
-We've not been able to locate him. -We can work together on this. -Wouldn't that be refreshing? -We have fingerprints and photos.
-Wouldn't that be refreshing? -We have fingerprints and photos.
-These are at least 15 years old. -He's camera-shy.
He'll be in disguise, anyway. We need photo alterations, Sam.
What I'm about to show you is highly classified.
This is a former colleague of Leary's. A close friend.
He went by Leary's home to try and get him to accept counseling.
This is how Leary treats his friends.
We need every possible variable.
Facial hair, glasses, weight change.
Keep in mind he's 15 years older now.
As good as they are, they aren't much good. The eyes are dead.
You can always tell a man by his eyes.
-Tomorrow morning I'd like you to-- -I'm resigning tomorrow.
What?
What for? Because you were scared down in Phoenix? I was scared too.
I have nightmares about that boat with the bag over my head.
I have nightmares about that boat with the bag over my head. I can't breathe. Phoenix clinched it.
I can't breathe. Phoenix clinched it.
-The service has counselors. -I've been to counselors.
-We can get this guy. -I can't do it!
Stop this cockamamie shit. Come on, pal, I need you.
Please.
Okay, Frank.
Cockamamie. That's a word your generation hasn't embraced yet.
You ought to use it once in a while to keep it alive.
-Cockamamie! -Yeah.
-Oh, God! -Well, it made you laugh.
You kill me, Frank.
Hello.
Hello, Frank. And let me welcome
Hello, Frank. And let me welcome all of you joining our program.
I know who you are, Leary.
I'm glad. Friends should be able to call each other by name.
-We're not friends. -Sure, we are.
I've seen what you do to friends.
-What's that supposed to mean? -You slit your friend's throat.
-You talked to Coppinger? -Yeah.
Did you de-louse? The man's a professional liar.
I saw the photos.
No, you saw what he wanted you to see.
I saw a picture of your friend with his throat cut.
What you don't know is that they sent my best friend...
...to my home to kill me!
-Your voice is shaking. -I haven't lied to you, Frank!
Everyone who ever knew you says you're sick.
-Your colleagues. Your wife. -What does your wife say about you?
Frank, I want you to understand.
We both used to think that this country was a very special place.
We both used to think that this country was a very special place. Do you have any idea what I've done for God and country?
Do you have any idea what I've done for God and country?
Some horrible things!
I don't even remember who I was before they got their claws into me.
They made you into a real monster.
And now they want to destroy me.
What do you see when you're in the dark and the demons come?
I see you standing over the grave of another dead President.
-That's not gonna happen. -Fuck you, Frank.
-That's not gonna happen. -Fuck you, Frank. I'm willing to trade my life for his and that's all it takes.
I'm willing to trade my life for his and that's all it takes.
That President is coming home from California in a box.
-Where in California? -The address?
I'll keep you in the game, but I won't throw it for you.
-I want you to give yourself up. -To live a long and fruitful life?
Don't lie to me. I have a rendezvous with death.
Don't lie to me. I have a rendezvous with death. So does the President. And so do you, if you get too close.
So does the President. And so do you, if you get too close.
You have a rendezvous with my ass, motherfucker!
You know how easily I could kill you?
I've watched you go home.
You are alive because I have allowed you to live.
Show me some damn respect!
St. Francis Hotel!
Frank.
Take my hand, Frank.
Take it. If you don't, you'll die.
Take it.
You're gonna shoot me after I saved your life?
Shit.
The only way to save the President is to shoot me.
Are you willing to trade your life for his...
...or is life too precious?
Leary, don't move!
I got him!
Al?
There's nothing here.
Frank, you've got a phone call.
Yeah? Frank, you looked so sad on the bus. I'm sorry, it was self-defense.
Frank, you looked so sad on the bus. I'm sorry, it was self-defense.
-Tell me about Skellum. -Skellum is worthless.
-Are you gonna meet him in L.A.? -You're way behind in the game.
I'm way ahead. I know what you look like. I've seen your eyes.
-They might look different next time. -Not what's behind them.
-You better pray I never find you. -You want to kill me, Frank?
That's right.
-The irony's so thick here. -There is no irony!
The same government that trained me to kill, trained you to protect.
Now you want to kill me. Up on that roof I protected you.
They'll write books about us.
-I'm tired of your bullshit! -Don't be a poor sport.
You could have taken me out, but you chose to save your ass.
It does make me wonder about Dallas.
Did you really do all you could, or did you make a choice there too?
Do you really have the guts to take a bullet?
I'll be thinking about that when I'm pissing on your grave.
There's no one named Skellum in all of Los Angeles?
There's no one named Skellum in all of Los Angeles? -What about Louisiana? -Hang on.
-What about Louisiana? -Hang on.
No Skellums. Sorry.
Damn it!
-The election's in three weeks. -Just stay out of California.
If this guy's so smart, he's not gonna tell you where he'll do it.
I don't think he'd lie to me.
You've become that close?
California is the key to the whole race.
-We can't let up now. -We have to change our procedure.
Frisk people within 50 yards.
Frisk people within 50 yards. At $10,000 dinners?
-You're overreacting. -If I don't, the President's dead.
-Why is he even here? -He's heading this investigation.
Then let him investigate, but keep him out of sight.
If you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of a campaign.
-Frank. Hi. -Hi.
-Up late? -L.A. will be a lot of work.
-What's up? -I've got a request.
I'd like you to talk to Watts. Get me on your team.
-He thinks you'll overreact. -What do you think?
-You're too close to all this. -That's why I've got to be there.
-I can spot him. Anticipate him. -You think he'll be in California?
-Why would he tip you off? -He wants to keep the game close.
This has nothing to do with you and me. Strictly professional.
But that son of a bitch killed my partner. My friend.
But that son of a bitch killed my partner. My friend. I know. I'm sorry.
I know. I'm sorry.
You're looking at a living legend.
The only active agent who ever lost a President.
Please.
Mr. Horrigan, welcome to Los Angeles.
Can the President close the gap in the little time he has left?
Today he's in California for a rally at the Bonaventure Hotel.
Field office, the advance team is at the Bonaventure.
-Any problems? -No.
We've swept the motorcade route.
Manholes are secured. Mailboxes removed. Abandoned vehicles towed.
We'll need sharpshooters on both those towers.
We need sharpshooters to cover those restricted areas.
Other polls today had the President three points behind.
Other polls today had the President three points behind. He'll have to close that margin in California.
He'll have to close that margin in California.
Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport.
-Raines, double-checking those exits? -Yes, this is the third time now.
Alert, section five.
Secret Service.
-Robert Stermer. -He's a bellboy. He's cleared.
-Robert, have a nice day. -No questions.
Come on, pack it up and move.
Mr. Carney, all set.
Finally we meet! You are James Carney?
-You must be Sandy Riggs. -So you really do exist.
-I'm very much human. -Let's go up to the bar.
-When does the President arrive? -Tomorrow, before dinner.
-When does the President arrive? -Tomorrow, before dinner. Here's an invitation. Don't lose it. The Secret Service is acting crazy.
Here's an invitation. Don't lose it. The Secret Service is acting crazy.
You've got a great seat, just across from the President.
So what is Microspan Corporation all about?
I just came to meet the President. I won't bore you with business.
I don't blame you. I don't understand high-tech.
I can't wait to introduce you. Look at this beautiful view.
Yes, very pretty.
Give me the list of dinner guests. Who was the organizer?
Give me the list of dinner guests. Who was the organizer? Sanford Riggs of the California Victory Fund.
Call LAPD and make sure they have no uniforms missing.
-It's been taken care of. -Call the hospital about blood.
Your average American businessman who looks at product marketing...
...sees the length and width of it. The Japanese see the depth.
We plan the next fiscal quarter. They plan the next quarter century.
-Our people don't understand that. -Mr. Riggs, can I talk to you?
-Who's that? -Secret Service agent.
-Do you know all these people? -I sure do.
-How about these pictures here? -I went through all this yesterday.
I'll cooperate, but this is bordering on harassment.
I'm a harassing kind of guy.
No, no, no, no.
I'll be right back, Mr. Carney.
He did what anyone of us would. He beat up a bellboy on television. I'd say he was overwrought.
He beat up a bellboy on television. I'd say he was overwrought.
We're all overwrought. Leary's out there someplace.
-You don't think he's a liability? -No.
Well, you're in the minority. I want him gone.
-Send him on to San Diego. -By whose order?
Traveler. Do you want to tell him or should I?
Miss Raines, somebody's approaching Traveler's suite.
-Hi. -Hi.
What are you doing up here?
What are you doing up here? Seeing what I could do.
Between the LAPD, the FBI and the rest of us...
...there are 229 people protecting Traveler tomorrow.
A lot of guns.
If Leary gets off a shot, we could be killed in the crossfire.
Frank.
-Bill Watts just called. -Heard about the bellman?
So did Traveler.
They want you to go to San Diego and assist in the advance.
Just like that.
It's not just you against Leary.
Have some faith in the rest of us.
You know something?
For years I've been listening to all these idiots...
For years I've been listening to all these idiots... ...with their pet theories on Dallas.
...with their pet theories on Dallas.
It was the Cubans, or the CIA.
The white supremacists, or the mob.
Whether it was one weapon or whether it was five.
None of that meant too much to me.
But Leary....
He questioned whether I had the guts to take that fatal bullet.
God, that was a beautiful day.
The sun was out.
It had been raining all morning.
The first shot sounded like a firecracker.
I looked over and saw him. I could tell he was hit.
I don't know why I didn't react.
I should've reacted. I should've been running.
I just couldn't believe it.
If only I'd reacted, I could've taken that shot.
It would've been all right with me.
-What's the number in San Diego? -619 ukulele.
-Ukulele? -That's how I remember it.
You just push U-K-E-L-E-L-E.
-Ukulele? Isn't that U-K-U? -I don't know.
-Ukulele? Isn't that U-K-U? -I don't know. But the phone number is U-K-E-L-E-L-E.
U-K-E-L. Wait a second.
Jesus.
We have an arrival. Chopper standing by.
-Southwest Savings, may I help you? -Southwest?
-Yes. May I help you? Hello? -What's your address?
Taxi!
-Post check. Post 3? -In place.
-Post 6? -In place.
-Post 12? -In place.
Wait right here.
There's no Leary in our accounts.
Try to imagine him in disguise. A hat, wigs, that sort of thing.
-I haven't been here long. -Who was here before you?
-Pam Magnus. -Where can I find her?
She's dead. She was murdered.
-She was murdered. -They won't cancel.
-Then make the arrival underground. -They want a big show.
-Then make the arrival underground. -They want a big show. -We need proof. -How about a dead president?
-We need proof. -How about a dead president?
I'm pulling up all the accounts Pam made, but it'll take time.
Fax me the list as soon as you get them.
All agents in position.
-Please step back. -Empty your pockets.
Thank you.
You're from Texas, right?
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
I'm sorry?
Frank! Watts is gonna shit if he sees you!
-Have you got a fax for me? -Yeah, what is it? What's this about?
What the hell is going on, Frank?
James Carney.
Carney, James.
-Jesus. -Frank!
-What the hell is he doing here? -I don't know.
-Who gave you permission-- -He's here. His name is Carney.
-Who gave you permission-- -He's here. His name is Carney. -I want the seating chart. -Give him the chart.
-I want the seating chart. -Give him the chart.
Gun!
Stop! Put the gun down!
Get down!
Don't shoot!
Get him in the car!
Hold your fire!
Get out of his way!
He's got a hostage!
Raines to shooters. If you have a shot, take it.
Nice view.
-What's the plan, captain? -It's your man. You tell me.
Get me sharpshooters on the north and west towers.
Take the subject out.
You had the guts. You took the bullet.
-I broke my damn ribs. -Sorry, I wasn't aiming at you.
Where the hell are the shooters?
-West tower in place. No lights. -No shot from the north.
A bullet-proof vest is a bit of a cheat.
-Otherwise, you played a good game. -It's no game, Leary.
I was doing my job. What do we do now?
Do you believe in the nobility of suicide?
No.
But if you want to blow your head off, be my guest.
Nicely put, but I don't want to leave this world alone.
-West tower, do you have a shot? -Negative, too dark. Target unclear.
-It's better to die with a friend. -Friend? You're a damn killer!
I saved your life. You owe me.
I saved your life. You owe me. -I don't owe you shit. -I was always honest with you.
-I don't owe you shit. -I was always honest with you.
-Go ahead and shoot. -It's Frank. Quiet!
-Come on. -Are you talking to me?
-What are you waiting for? -Waiting for?
I'm waiting for some gratitude.
Without me, you're a sad-eyed, piano-playing drunk.
I brought you into this game. I let you keep up with me.
-I made you a hero today. -You didn't make me anything.
I redeemed your pathetic life.
I just did my job. You're the one with a pathetic life.
-Go ahead and shoot! -If they fire you'll be hit.
-I want you to thank me first. -Shut up and shoot.
All right, Frank.
-All right, Frank. -Stand by to fire on my command.
-Sleep well, my friend. -Just one thing, aim high.
-What? -Aim high!
-Now! -You bastard!
Take my hand. If you don't, you'll die.
You want to save me, Frank?
You want to save me, Frank? To be honest, no. But it's my job.
To be honest, no. But it's my job.
Take it.
Are you okay?
We've worked with Agent Horrigan for some time.
He exemplifies courage and self-sacrifice. Frank!
I guess I overreacted again, Harry.
Agent Horrigan, why are you retiring from the Secret Service?
Well, I hate desk work and I'm too old for running around.
And thanks to all this press, I'm no good for undercover work.
How are you, Frank? The President sent his limo for you.
How are you, Frank? The President sent his limo for you. -That's the least he could do. -Good. I love public transportation.
Come on in.
Make yourself at home.
-So, what do you think? -I like it.
Hello, Frank. By the time you hear this, it'll be over.
The President is most likely dead and so am I.
Frank, did you kill me? Who won our game?
Not that it matters.
Among friends, like you and me, it's how you play the game.
Among friends, like you and me, it's how you play the game. The game's done.
It's time to get on with your life.
I worry that you have no life to get on with.
You're a good man.
You're a good man. Good men, like you and me, are destined to travel a lonely road.
Goodbye and good luck.
I bet you that brown pigeon flies off before the white one.
Who is he?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Just shut up, Angela. Let him do what he wants!
Just shut up, Angela. Let him do what he wants! -No! No! -No!
All right, go ahead.
No!
No! Grandpa!
No! No!
No!
Help me! Help me!
No! No!
Please don't kill me.
Okay, people.
Now please take your time in answering this question.
I want you to take a good look at Mr. Boffano, the man seated in front of you there.
And tell me if you've ever seen him before.
No, sir, I haven't.
I'm sorry I can't hear you. Would you pull the mic a little closer, please?
No, sir, I haven't. -On TV? In the newspapers? -No, sir.
-On TV? In the newspapers? -No, sir.
Do you read newspapers, ma'am? When I have the time.
How often is that? Never.
I am a single mother, Your Honor, and I am trying to be a sculptor.
I have, well, a job all day and when I get home I take care of my son
I feel stupid saying that I don't keep up with the news, but...
I feel stupid saying that I don't keep up with the news, but... Well, that's just how it is. I don't. I don't have time.
Ma'am, are you saying that you've heard nothing about this case?
Well, no, I have heard something.
When I told my son that I might be picked for jury duty, he said,
When I told my son that I might be picked for jury duty, he said, "Hey, maybe you'll get picked for that big mafia case."
And I said, "What big mafia case?" And he said, "You know, Louie Boffano.
He's gonna be tried for popping those guys."
He's gonna be tried for popping those guys." And he said that popping is when you kill somebody.
I said, "Okay, I've got that. But who's Louie Boffano?"
And he said, "Mom, come on, he's the big SpaghettiO."
Okay, people. Enough!
Well, ma'am, what I want you to understand is that this may be a lengthy trial,
Well, ma'am, what I want you to understand is that this may be a lengthy trial, and that you would be sequestered during deliberations.
So if you tell me that it would prove a grave hardship for you to serve on this jury,
I'll excuse you.
Well, then I think I could get someone to take care of my son for when I'm sequestered.
to take care of my son for when I'm sequestered. You would like to serve?
Yes, I would. Yes.
Hey, Eddie, that license is registered on the name of Annie Laird.
Hey, Eddie, that license is registered on the name of Annie Laird. 48 Seminary Lane. Pharaoh, New York.
Thanks, Joey. Take care of yourself. Hey, guess what? You were a star today.
Hey, guess what? You were a star today. -That's bull. I was zero-kid today. -Why?
Do you know where Jesse is on Dragon Rider?
Do you know where Jesse is on Dragon Rider? He got to the fifth dome last night, man. I can't believe it.
I can't get to the second dome without some stupid-ass troll slave clobbering me.
Well, maybe Nintendo's not your forte. Mom, it's not Nintendo. It's Sega.
Maybe you should focus on something else, like your homework.
Anyway, you were a star today. The star of county court.
I told them my son called Louie Boffano the big SpaghettiO,
and it got a big laugh.
You're on that case? Well, that's the one if they take me.
All right, she just picked up her kid at her babysitter's or something,
and we're going west on Ratner away from her house.
Well, thank you, Eddie.
Hey, stay with her. I'm gonna check out her place.
Yeah, right.
It wasn't just the old godfather that got killed.
They killed his grandson, too.
It made me start thinking about you and... I don't know. I'm always talking to you about responsibility, right?
Okay, so it wasn't such a good idea. But it is a little bit exciting.
I need a little excitement.
Eddie, what's going on?
All right, I don't know where the fuck we are. Looks like some kind of fucking whacked-out church or something.
Maybe she's some kind of religious freak. Look, Vince, I think we ought to let this one go.
I mean, this whole thing, it just don't smell right to me.
Eddie, you're fussing.
She's at work. Relax. Yeah, right. Whatever.
And, you know, anything in the Reporter Dispatch about the trial, anything at all, you're gonna have to cut it out so I don't see it.
Mom, you don't read the papers, you use it to wrap stuff. Whatever. Just do it.
And, you know, when the jury deliberates, I'll have to be sequestered, which means I'll have to stay in a motel and you'll have to stay with Mrs. Kolodny.
which means I'll have to stay in a motel and you'll have to stay with Mrs. Kolodny.
Mrs... Oh, shit! For how long? I don't know. A week, maybe two, however long it takes.
I don't know. A week, maybe two, however long it takes.
-Mom, tell me you're kidding. -I tell you I'm not kidding.
Well, why? I mean, come on. You just go in, you come back out and you say "guilty."
-Oliver. -What?
-Oliver. -Say, "Fry the sucker."
Come on, how long does it take? I don't know, but do you think you can shut up?
-Six seconds? -Oliver.
-"Oliver." -Oliver.
And end the letter, "Sincerely, John Slivey.
Devotional Services Incorporated. Books for the Soul."
Oliver?
Math. Now.
Mom, I've been thinking about this all night. You need to...
All right, she's walking towards the car with her kid.
Hey, Eddie, what do you think of her? What do you mean, "What do I think of her?"
I don't think nothing of her.
Do you think she's sexy? Come on, she's a fucking mommy.
Well, I think she's sexy, and smart.
This isn't your average mommy, Eddie.
I just think she's trouble. Well, I think she's brilliant.
She makes sculptures that you can't see, that you can only feel.
Yeah, you want to get out of there? She's coming your way.
All right, they just turned into the driveway. You better get the fuck out of there.
Come on, for Christ's sake, get the fuck out of there.
They're going in the front door. Go out the back.
Vincent, what the fuck are you doing?
Oliver.
All right, they're going in the front door. You gotta get out the back. Are you hearing me?
I don't want any of your horse crap.
Come on.
-I'm hungry. -What do you want?
-Is there anything to eat around here? -Maybe a cockroach or two.
Mom, it's your duty to feed me.
-No, I'm sorry, can't do it. I'm busy. -What? Feeding your buddy, Dragon Rider.
All right, you turn on the machine and I'll call for pizza.
-What do you want on it? -Some sausage.
Sausage. Get out of my face!
Sausages isn't crap. What do you mean? Sausage is good. No. Hi, yes, I'd like to order a large pizza, please.
-Use your ax. -Okay. Okay. Turn around and go and get him.
Go, go, go... Die, you sucker.
Okay, you got him. Hit him again. Hit him again. -Go. Go. -Again. Again.
-Don't get away. Hit him again. -I got him.
-I did it. -Okay. All right!
Okay. You're getting hit. Get him. There we go. No.
-Chill out, Momba. -Okay. Okay.
Just raise your ax. -Remember, I told you. -Right there. Yeah, yeah.
Okay, now don't get hit by the fist. Hit him! You're just, like, gonna sit there.
Hit him! You're just, like, gonna sit there. You set me up.
Okay, I'm gonna get him. There we go. You cannot run from the wrath of Momba!
The Momba!
-Hey, Lainie. -Hey, Annie.
-Is she here? -Yeah, she's coming right out.
His name is Mark Cordell. He's... Well, I don't know... He's very polite, but he can be very intimidating.
He's very polite, but he can be very intimidating. You know what I mean?
He knows his shit, Annie.
He does Alice Aycock, Christy Rupp.
He does not like the big-dick marble cowboys.
Anyway, he collects for himself, but mostly for friends. And I mean big, big collectors, honey, big, big shits.
And I mean big, big collectors, honey, big, big shits. Like?
Sato Makamoto. Bidi Karamora.
My stuff's gonna go to Japan? I don't know, just some of the names he mentioned.
-Wait a minute, you didn't ask who? -Of course I asked. He gave me vague.
And that was good enough for you?
Well, that and a check, for $24,000.
Half of which is yours.
God, do I need this!
Annie Laird? I thought it might be you.
Inez said you might drop by so I took a chance.
I bought some of your pieces. I'm Mark Cordell.
-Hi. -Hi.
I've got a check in my bag. Thank you. Well, I didn't pay you nearly what they're worth.
No. Please, please.
How do you know me? Have we met before?
Inez showed me your picture in the catalog.
Well, you know, she said that my pieces were gonna go to Japan. Is that true?
-Yeah, that's likely. -So does that mean that's it?
I'm not gonna see them again. No, not necessarily. No.
Do you have some time to talk this over? Maybe have some lunch?
Now? You know, I'm... I'm supposed to be upstate by two o'clock for jury duty.
I'm supposed to be upstate by two o'clock for jury duty.
Well, I wouldn't wanna make you late for that. Well, maybe just a quick bite.
So what was the first one? Okay, the first one. Let me see...
The very first one.
When my parents split-up, I went to stay with my grandmother for the summer
in Allentown, Pennsylvania. I hated it.
So I made this model of a wild meadow.
And I would keep it under the bed.
It had these bushes. It had thorns that I made out of staples,
It had these bushes. It had thorns that I made out of staples, and there was a stream made out of tin foil.
And I would reach under the bed, you know, 'cause I was afraid of the dark,
and I would reach under and just touch it
and... dream I was there.
-And that's how you got started? -Yeah.
So what about you? Were you afraid of the dark?
Well, it wasn't really very much dark in my house. We had a lot of kids. I was the youngest.
We had a lot of kids. I was the youngest.
A real madhouse, you know... a zoo.
Anyway, you wanna know where your pieces are going, yes?
Do you know Japan?
Well, contemporary art is a sort of currency there now
because its value is so inconstant.
It's so attractively pliant.
Wait a second. I'm lost.
I'm not connecting the dots here. None of that really matters. All that matters is we need to start getting new pieces,
All that matters is we need to start getting new pieces, try to record some six figure sales,
get you the right review in Artforum, a proper niche at the Basel Art Fair.
That sort of thing. But that's my job, don't you worry about that. -Listen, Mr. Cordell, I... -Please.
Call me Mark. Okay, Mark.
-May I call you Annie? -Listen...
-May I call you Annie? -Listen... Yeah, you can call me whatever the hell you want,
but I'm not interested in having my art used as some kind of currency.
Annie, what do you think I get out of this?
You think I make money off of this? I don't. I don't need to.
What I do for a living pays me very, very well. -Could I get you guys-- -No. Not now.
I do this so that artists like you can go into your studio
and work on your boxes and not worry
and work on your boxes and not worry whether or not your children are being fed.
So that these idiots that control the art world, these insects,
you don't have to bother with them.
So you can just do your work.
-Hey, you guys. -Okay, what do you think?
Forget about it. You're wearing the black one. -You look sexy in it. -The black one?
Juliet, will you stop it. I do not wanna look sexy.
-I'm not wearing the black one. -Well, too bad.
And promise me you won't be shy with this guy. I'm not shy.
-No? -No. I'm private.
No, no, no. You clam up.
I just don't babble to men, that's all.
Babble? Annie, this is not babble, this is an art.
First you say something to pump up his little ego, and then,
First you say something to pump up his little ego, and then, with a sly little, subtle savvy you puncture his balloon.
Then you stroke his silly little ego again,
and then you push him back, and you pull him in, and you push him back, you pull him, and you push him, and you pull him
until you've got him dizzy and staggering and falling at your feet.
-Juliet? -Yeah. When's the last time you slept?
You mean "sleep" sleep? Not just closing my eyes for a second while I'm doing a tracheotomy?
I don't know. I slept for a couple of hours on Monday night.
-Jesus! Why aren't you at home, in bed? -Would you cut it out? I'm going to take the kids to a movie. This is a cinch.
-Annie? -What?
How could I not come?
This thing today was the triumph of your life, girlfriend.
What?
You you You did it
What did I do? You sold three goddamn pieces!
You know what? I did!
Laozi says that returning is the movement of the Dao.
So are you a Daoist? I don't know.
Laozi says that when the foolish man first hears of the Dao,
Laozi says that when the foolish man first hears of the Dao, he laughs out loud, which is certainly true in my case, I'm afraid,
but I also find it very compelling.
"Become a valley, stop fighting against that structure
"Become a valley, stop fighting against that structure against that fate, what have you,
and everything will flow to you."
What do you think?
I think we need to take a left.
-Should I just... -Yeah, any one. It doesn't matter.
Just like the ones in the gallery. You just stick your hand under and--
Just like the ones in the gallery. You just stick your hand under and-- Cop a feel, yeah.
"The Dream of Giving Notice."
What do you feel? A keyboard.
A computer keyboard and something rough on the keys. Is it sandpaper?
This is... What is this? This is wire.
This is a cage.
This is a birdcage.
I'm caught in a birdcage.
The door is open, but I can't quite squeeze through.
And now I feel a breeze on my fingertips just beyond my reach. How did you do that?
And now a fluttering...
This is a bird. This is amazing.
This is also a little bit strange. I mean, reaching up underneath here and feeling your...
I mean, reaching up underneath here and feeling your...
Private stuff? Private stuff.
My God! Annie, it doesn't have to only be a dream.
You can give notice. You can escape that hell.
You can do nothing but just make art for the rest of your life.
Would you like to feel another one? There's a really good one right over there.
-This one? -Yeah, that one.
But I've already felt that one.
No, no. That one's the one... I just finished that one.
Well, I felt it yesterday.
Yesterday? I didn't even know you yesterday.
But I was here.
You're kidding, right?
Don't get up.
Annie, listen to me now.
You're in danger and your son is in danger. Oliver. What do you mean? Where's my son?
He went with Jesse and Juliet to the movies, didn't he?
He's gonna be all right.
Such an extraordinary child.
Remember last night, when the two of you were playing that video game upstairs
and you started to panic and he said, "Chill out, Momba." You remember that?
How do you know that? Annie...
when I heard the two of you, together, laughing, I swore to myself that I would do everything
I swore to myself that I would do everything to make sure that he gets through this.
Do you understand me, Annie? This is a very dangerous time for him.
He could stray.
He could commit some childish error and we could lose him.
That quick.
But you know what I think? I think he's gonna be safe.
I think he'll grow up and he'll be healthy.
And your friend, Juliet, she'll be safe too. She'll be fine.
Everyone you care about, they'll all be safe as churches.
Do you hear what I'm saying? Annie, nod your head now. Do as I say.
Annie, nod your head now. Do as I say.
And, as for you...
all you have to do is wait.
That's all.
And then someone is going to contact you and tell you to say two words.
Two precisely.
Do you know what they are? Have you guessed yet?
No.
Not guilty.
-Okay, brat, see you later. -Okay, I'll see you later.
Get out of here.
What do you want me to do?
Protect him.
Tell him that your date turned out to be a creep.
Hey. Hi there. -Hey, you all right? -Yeah.
-Hey, you all right? -Yeah. It's nice to see you.
-What's the matter? -Nothing. -Did you have a good time? -Yeah.
-Did you have a good time? -Yeah. -So what's the matter? -Nothing, nothing.
Things just didn't go great with that guy.
-Is he still gonna buy your boxes? -Doesn't matter.
-Here. -Are you okay? I am fine, sweetie. Go. I'll be up in a minute, all right.
Just go on.
I still wanna buy your boxes. No, I don't want you to buy my boxes.
Annie, this will be over before you know it.
-What? -Annie. Hey, what's up?
Boone? Yeah, it's me.
Oh, Jesus. How are you? I'm good. How the hell are you?
I'm good. How the hell are you? Hey, listen, don't go anywhere, I've to put money in the phone, okay?
Hey, listen, don't go anywhere, I've to put money in the phone, okay?
It's the 1950s here. Don't do anything. It's gonna sound like we're disconnected. Are you there?
Yes, that's better. So, I brought one of the kids down to the hospital today,
and I just thought I'd grab a chance to call you.
How long has it been? How long since we talked? Well, I don't know, probably the fall, sometime in the fall.
Well, I don't know, probably the fall, sometime in the fall.
No, has it been... It's been that long. You know, I've meaning to call,
but I'm still three hours from the nearest phone. It's just not that easy.
How are you guys anyway? How's Oliver?
Annie? Are you there? Yeah? Yeah, we're okay.
Yeah, we're okay. Good. I thought I lost you. Listen, Annie, book your airline early this time, okay?
Listen, Annie, book your airline early this time, okay? Because last time you know what happened.
You know, I don't think we'll be able to make it this summer. I'm sorry.
You're not gonna make it? Annie, you'll miss the fiesta. Why? Boone,
you know, just because we had a connection once, about a million years ago,
doesn't mean that you can just keep popping up into my life whenever you want.
Annie, what's the matter?
I have someone here and he doesn't like these phone calls,
and, frankly, neither do I.
Okay. Sorry. I didn't know.
You okay? Yeah. And I'll be great when I can just get back to sleep.
Yeah. And I'll be great when I can just get back to sleep.
Good night, Annie.
I'm talking to the Teacher and he says to me, "Man don't want to come out of his house. Man don't want to be killed."
So what?
So we could dig a tunnel.
-You remember what he said to me, Paulie? -I remember, Louie. I remember.
-You remember what he said to me, Paulie? -I remember, Louie. I remember. And I say to the Teacher, I say, "You wanna dig a tunnel?
Okay, dig a tunnel. Just kill that cocksucker."
Mr. DeCicco, that is you on the prosecutions tape, -isn't it? -Yeah.
It's you and Louie Boffano talking about the Teacher.
So, who is this Teacher? I don't know.
Do you know why he's called the Teacher, Mr. DeCicco? 'Cause when you see him, school's out.
School's out. Meaning?
What the fuck you think it means? Means you're dead.
Mr. DeCicco, not here.
-Sorry. -Did you have any direct dealings with this Teacher?
No, nobody knows who he is. He just does special jobs for Louie.
But didn't you testify yesterday under direct
But didn't you testify yesterday under direct that the Teacher had suggested a strategy for negotiating with the Cali Drug Cartel.
-Maybe, but he didn't-- -It was the Teacher
who arranged the link between Louie and the Calabrian Mafia, wasn't it?
Two alliances Salvador Riggio bitterly opposed.
And then one day the Teacher said he could dig a tunnel to the house of Salvador Riggio for the purpose of killing him, right?
Right. And Louie Boffano said,
"You wanna dig a tunnel. Okay, dig a tunnel."
Yeah.
After all, the Teacher was the boss. -He can do what he wants, right? -Come on, give me a break.
-He can do what he wants, right? -Come on, give me a break. Teacher's not the boss.
You know of a single case in which his counsel wasn't followed, Mr. DeCicco?
I told you, Louie's the boss. Louie gives the orders.
You mean Louie seems to give the orders, right?
Mr. DeCicco, do you know what a puppet is?
-Objection, Your Honor. -Sustained.
I'm sorry. Let me put it another way.
This is a puppet. Maybe it seems to make its own decisions.
Objection. Sustained. Mr. Bozeman, this is not a circus.
Sustained. Mr. Bozeman, this is not a circus. I withdraw the puppet.
No further questions. The reporter will strike that remark from the record.
The jury will disregard it. Counsel, take that puppet and put it away. I just sustained an objection to it.
Counsel, take that puppet and put it away. I just sustained an objection to it.
Oliver? -Oliver? -Yeah.
Please get down here. Anybody here?
-Oliver... -It was a joke. Well, I'm not in the mood, okay?
-What is it, Oliver? -Mom...
What is this? This is my math...
You should just say something. Even if it's just, "Okay."
What is this?
I thought I told you never to come here.
Well, I... You know, I need some help.
Could I get a few bucks on next month's rent?
-What the fuck is this? -Don't touch that!
It's a piece of art.
Rodney, it's a very delicate piece of art.
There you go. Here's somebody you have got to meet. You have got to meet Lorraine.
Lorraine? Who's Lorraine? My girlfriend.
What's this? More art?
That's my girlfriend.
And, yeah, it's a piece of art. These are all pieces of art.
That's why I didn't want you dropping by unexpectedly because I'm...
working on some very important pieces.
...who you are? What you do? Let me tell you this. Get the...
Rodney?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'll see you later.
Going to do better. You know, you've said that before.
You know what? I don't want to discuss this, okay?
Just get your coat on and let's go. We don't have anything to eat in this house.
Hey, I know you.
You're the artist, right? Box lady?
Buddy of mine, Mark Cordell, bought a couple of your pieces.
This your kid?
-Hey, how you doing? Nice to meet you. -Hi.
What were those frozen things that you like?
-You mean Bubble Pops? -Yeah, go get some.
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m. The park and ride in Banktree.
-It's off 684, you know it? -Yes.
What did I say? The park and ride, 684, in Banktree.
What time? 7:00 a.m.
Look, you'll be fine.
We're not animals.
I got a kid, too, just a little older than him. Teenager.
Anyway, I just want to tell you I know what you're going through, and hang in there.
Hey! What's your name?
I can't tell you my name. What do I call you then?
Call me Cap'n Crunch.
Captain, thanks.
How are you holding up, Annie?
How have you been feeling lately?
Why don't you tell me? You listen to every word we say.
I don't enjoy invading your privacy.
-You don't? -No.
But we can't afford the slightest error.
Now, I'm gonna say something to you that might be unwelcome, but I'm gonna say it nonetheless,
I think you're being a little harsh with your child.
He may start to ask questions. He may talk to his friends.
He won't. He won't.
I just want to finish this as quickly and as painlessly as possible,
but I'm gonna need your help.
We have to work together, Annie. I'll do what I can, all right?
Do you understand what our strategy was in the courtroom yesterday?
What was our strategy yesterday?
Louie Boffano didn't order the killing.
He's in the mob, maybe a bad guy, but just a figurehead.
He doesn't give orders. That's right.
And if Louie Boffano isn't guilty then who is?
And if Louie Boffano isn't guilty then who is? Who did kill Salvador Riggio?
You did.
You think I'm the Teacher, Annie?
Aren't you?
I would have you believe that.
The Teacher scares you, doesn't he, Annie?
Well, I'm sorry for the fear. If I had any choice...
Any choice... But...
if I can keep you scared... I can save your life.
Then he got down on the bed between my husband and me.
And he put his gun on Sal, on his mouth.
And what did the man do then, Mrs. Riggio? He said, "Open up, Sal, I don't wanna make a mess.
He said, "Open up, Sal, I don't wanna make a mess.
"I don't wanna scare your wife. "We gotta work together, Sal."
-And then? -Then he killed my husband.
He killed my Sal. Shot him.
And what happened next? Then the door opened and my...
Mrs. Riggio, did someone come in?
Tommy, my grandson.
He came in the room,
and he saw my Sal dead. And then what happened?
Then the man, he saw my baby.
And Tommy ran away, he ran down the hall.
He ran after him.
Then I heard the shot.
He killed my baby!
No further questions.
-Oliver? -Yeah.
Mom,you know, Juliet called again. It's only, like, the tenth time.
-What's he doing here? -What do you mean? Jesse?
You're supposed to be doing your homework. Bye, Jesse.
See you later.
Who the hell has been cutting into the newspaper?
I did. You told me to.
You know what? You never do anything that I ask you to. Why the hell did you have to do this?
'Cause you told me to!
What did it say? You're not supposed to know what it says.
You said you weren't supposed to know what's in the paper or on TV. That's not right.
You don't tell me what's right and wrong, you got it? -Now, what the hell did it say? -I don't know.
-Now, what the hell did it say? -I don't know. Well, did it say Boffano was guilty?
-I don't know! -What did it say?
Was it compelling evidence, persuasive evidence, -do they want you to think he's guilty? -Mom, everybody knows he's guilty.
-do they want you to think he's guilty? -Mom, everybody knows he's guilty. What's the matter?
What do you mean everybody?
-Who the hell have you been talking to? -Nobody. You asked me not to.
I am not asking you, I am telling you.
You talk to anybody about this trial, and I swear to God, I will beat the shit out of you.
Do you understand me? Do you?
And that bullshit crybaby stuff stops right now!
Oh, shit.
I can't... I can't do this.
Where is everybody? Did I get this wrong again? Oh, jeez.
Did I get this wrong again? Oh, jeez.
What do you mean? What time are you supposed to be here? I was supposed to be here now.
You know what? I'm gonna go see if they're in the old practice fields.
Hold on. -Oliver! -Just hold on! Get back here! Oliver, I don't want you going!
Get back here! Oliver, I don't want you going! Just stay there!
We need to talk. I have to go. I'm gonna be late.
I have to go. I'm gonna be late. -And I-- -Walk with me.
-And I-- -Walk with me. -I can't. -What if I were in trouble?
-I can't. -What if I were in trouble? -What kind of trouble? -What if I were in really bad trouble?
-What kind of trouble? -What if I were in really bad trouble?
What is it? Like a man, or work? What is it?
What if I couldn't tell you? What do you mean, "If you couldn't tell me?" I'm your best friend. You've got to tell me.
I'm your best friend. You've got to tell me. -So you would tell me? -Of course.
Then do that.
I can't tell you what to do, Annie, I don't have a kid.
Still you love him. You love him as much as I do. Don't you?
Still you love him. You love him as much as I do. Don't you? Tell me what to do, Juliet.
I think you've got to go to the judge.
You're gonna go to the judge,
you're gonna tell him that your son got sick.
Tell him that your son just got diagnosed with leukemia.
-He's not gonna buy that. -Yeah, he will.
If you have a note from your doctor. From me.
Okay?
I don't know.
I don't know. It just sounds sort of crazy.
You're right. What you're doing, the way you're handling it, going along with these guys. It's much smarter.
-Then why did you-- -Because I don't take orders very well.
From monsters, I don't take them at all. But that's just me.
He's your kid, Annie.
Once we're back in the car, you never talk about this. Okay?
Not a word, not a question. Say it. Say, "I'll never talk about this in the car."
I'll never talk about this in the car.
"Or in the house." Or in the house.
I knew it. -Oh, God. -You're just too smart.
I'm glad you figured it out.
And I'm glad you went to Juliet.
-Are you scared? -Yeah.
But we're gonna turn this thing around, okay? Yeah.
Excuse me, may I help you?
I just need to see the judge.
What are you doing here? I need to see you.
You know who I am.
Yes, you're a juror. Open that door, please.
I wanna talk to you alone.
Let me just explain something to you.
When you come into my chambers, this is not a trivial thing.
When a juror visits a judge, this can have serious consequences.
if you still have a problem and you wanna talk about it,
then I'll call the Defense Attorney and the DA and we'll sit down and talk--
No, I wanna talk to you alone. I don't want them. I only wanna talk to you.
I don't want them. I only wanna talk to you.
-Alone? -Alone.
Well, you can't talk to me alone and whatever that is,
Well, you can't talk to me alone and whatever that is, I don't wanna see it. Not without the attorneys present.
Are you telling me that I'm making a mistake?
Madam, what I remember about you
is that I gave you every opportunity to get out of serving on this jury.
But you insisted you wanted jury duty. Do you recall?
Well, you want to serve, you don't want to serve.
You have a problem, but you don't think the defendant has a right to hear it.
Well, I think you're wrong.
He happens to be on trial for murder.
He was every right to hear it.
shall I try to locate his counsel? No, I've changed my mind.
You and your fucking '77 Knicks.
You think your fucking Earl "The Pearl," could play John Starks?
Hey, man, Earl "The Pearl" would've blown fucking John Starks right out of the Garden, my friend.
John Starks would take Earl "The Pearl..." Annie, I'd like you to meet Rodney.
Annie, I'd like you to meet Rodney. Rodney, this is my friend, Annie.
Your girl is a fucking knockout.
Rodney, here, is about a half a gallon of sewage that just backed up from New York City, Annie.
Hey, don't give me that shit!
I offered to drive Rodney home because I think he's had a little bit too much to drink.
Annie, would you like to ride with us?
Shove it up your ass. -I'll drive my own car. -Hey, man, get in the car.
-I'll drive my own car. -Hey, man, get in the car. Come on. I want you to get into the backseat, 'cause I want Annie to ride up front with me.
Rodney is not making a great success in his sojourn here on earth.
He's a drunk, he's an imbecile. You button up that bum hole, buddy.
But his friends take good care of him. Even after all those DUIs,
he's still on the road.
Hey, you said you had some scotch, right?
Break it out, shit-for-brains.
Annie, could you reach into my bag and take out the bottle that's in there?
-This? -Yeah, that's it.
-I don't want you to spill any, Rodney. -What do you think?
I'm gonna stick this in my face? Just suck on it.
If you think it's gonna affect my high regard for you, Rodney, well, it won't.
You asshole.
Just lie down, Rodney. I've put something in there to make you sleepy.
So go to sleep. Go to sleep.
-What are you doing? -I'm doing Rodney.
I wanna see what life is like through Rodney's eyes.
And just like I thought, it is one big blur.
Look at Rodney now, Annie, look at him. He's just like the rest of us.
Spending all of his time trying to stay out of the way of fear.
Anything to not feel fear. Anything.
Don't you ever feel fear? I feel it all the time, Annie. I had a bout with it today.
But you know, Annie, I bow to fear.
But you know, Annie, I bow to fear. It's terror that teaches me my shape, Annie.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Lacrosse. They say it's the most dangerous sport in the country,
but I guess if it weren't very dangerous,
but I guess if it weren't very dangerous, then young boys wouldn't wanna play, would they?
Oliver plays lacrosse, doesn't he?
What are we doing here? I wanna teach you what you love, Annie.
The gray suits want you to love the law, justice,
but what good are the gray suits?
Are they gonna shield you?
Are the gray suits gonna shield you, Annie?
Can the gray suits shield you from somebody like me?
I mean, look at me! I'm Rodney. I'm old, and I'm tired,
I'm Rodney. I'm old, and I'm tired,
but when I'm behind the wheel of this car, I'm a young buck again.
I might take this curve here a little too fast.
Please stop!
Look, I didn't tell the judge, I swear! I did not tell the judge.
I didn't tell him!
-Who's gonna protect you, Annie? -You will.
-Who's gonna protect you? -You will.
And I want you to say it! "The Teacher will protect me!"
The Teacher will protect me!
-Say it! -The Teacher will protect me!
-Say it again! -The Teacher will protect me!
Sure, you can put the Teacher in jail, you can sizzle Louie Boffano,
but what are you gonna do about this drunken Rodney behind the wheel of this car?
I'm looking down this road and it's just one big blur to me!
But I think I see a boy on a bicycle who looks an awful lot to me like... Hey.
Oh, God, no!
No! Oh, God! Please no!
-Who will protect you? -Please, no!
-The Teacher! -Who will protect you?
-The Teacher! -Who will shield you? -Say, "The Teacher!" -The Teacher!
-Say it, "The Teacher will protect me!" -The Teacher!
-Say it! Again! Again! Again! -The Teacher will protect me!
-Say it! Again! Again! Again! -The Teacher will protect me! No!
Here.
You can't let him drive like that! You're absolutely right, Annie.
He could hit somebody.
No!
Make sure she gets home safe, Eddie.
Where you going?
Why did he do that?
'Cause you scared him.
You don't ever wanna do that shit again 'cause he will hurt you.
I don't wanna see you get hurt.
You said you had a kid, right, captain?
Eddie. My name is Eddie.
Yeah, I got a daughter. 14.
Why do you let him do these things?
You got too many questions. Come on. Let's get out of here.
Hey, Mom. Do you think we could go to the mall later? No.
-Get some ice cream? -No.
I wanted to tell you about my day.
Did you talk to Juliet today?
Juliet? No. Why don't you finish your homework?
Did you talk to Juliet today?
Did you talk to Juliet today?
Juliet? No. Why don't you finish your homework?
He looks good. -You gonna examine me like that sometime? -You wish.
-You gonna examine me like that sometime? -You wish. You're on call on Saturday night.
You said he can be reasoned with.
But he can't.
-What happened? -We tried it your way, Juliet. And it didn't work out.
Now, you've got to promise me that you're gonna stay out of our lives.
And that's what Oliver wants, too?
Well, Oliver thinks that we should be heroes, but he's wrong.
But he's promised to keep his mouth shut so that's all that matters.
And now you've got to promise, too. Promise you what? I'm going to abandon you?
That you're gonna keep your mouth shut and stay out of our lives.
It's my life, right? Isn't that what you said? My life, my kid?
-Right? -Yeah. Promise me.
I promise you.
Hey, Oliver. Hi, Annie.
-Oliver... -Puberty.
Okay. "Guilty." "Guilty."
"Guilty."
-"Not guilty." -What?
That's what it says. Calm down.
"Guilty."
"Guilty."
"Guilty." "Guilty."
"Guilty."
"Guilty." "Guilty."
"Not guilty."
-Two... -So we have 10 guiltys and two not guiltys.
Wait a minute. I mean, I'm sorry, but how can anybody think this guy is not guilty?
I mean, who voted not guilty? Can I ask?
You can ask, but nobody has to say if they don't want to.
-I voted not guilty. -You did? Why?
I don't think the government proved its case.
-Guys, guys, come on. -"Proved?" It's open and shut. So you say.
I mean, we have the tape, right? Did you hear the tape? So you say.
Roland, you're gonna drive me nuts.
Look, suppose they were all lying, all the witnesses.
The cop, the mule, DeCicco.
We still got the goddamn tape.
I mean, it's on the tape that he says... What is it about the tunnel?
-Yeah. -I says to the Teacher, I says,
"You wanna dig a tunnel, dig a tunnel, kill that cocksucker."
I mean, you think he's talking about the Tunnel of Love?
Hold on. Don't tell me you're the other one. For Christ's sakes.
Don't tell me you're the other one. For Christ's sakes.
Look, that tape, I mean, does that prove anything?
-I mean, it wasn't a direct order. -Right.
"Kill that cocksucker." That's not a direct order?
-Come on, he could've just been bragging. -He was bragging.
He was bragging how he'd send a hit man to kill Riggio.
You know, maybe it's not fair to pick on the not guiltys.
You know, maybe we should have to explain our case. You know? What's our evidence? Let's start with that.
What's our evidence? Let's start with that. This is ridiculous.
Man, come on, sit down. It's the process.
We're gonna be stuck in that motel for weeks.
Despite substantial evidence in the State's case against mob boss, Louie Boffano,
speculation turns toward the possibility of a hung jury
I wanna know why you're not leaning on the union guy.
Its making me nervous.
Because he's not powerful enough. That's why. Is that right?
So this artist broad, she's the one with the power now, huh? We hope so, yeah.
Well, you know what I think? I wanna go with the union guy.
And when my father's away, I'm the boss of this family,
so I think you'd better listen to what I'm telling you, okay?
Let's go.
Joseph.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Go back to the car. Let me ask you something.
Do you take money from my family?
I take a great deal of money from your family, but that doesn't make you in charge. I mean, Joseph, your father knows what's going on.
I mean, Joseph, your father knows what's going on.
I don't like you, okay? I don't like what you're doing to my family,
I don't like the shit you're getting us into with these Cali assholes,
these fucking guys from Calabria!
You act like you're some fancy, sweet-smelling piece of shit.
You're from the same neighborhood that I'm from, that my father's from.
You know what I think? I think you're just a sick fuck.
I know you're a friendless fuck.
You always was, even when you was a little kid.
Even Eddie. He thought you were smart, he brought you into the family,
but even him, he don't like you.
Nobody likes you.
I got work to do. Hey, listen to me!
Go with that union guy.
-Hello? -When your roommate falls asleep again, come out to the balcony and slide the door shut behind you.
come out to the balcony and slide the door shut behind you.
Annie. Come here.
I want you to take this and stand over there and pretend to be smoking.
It's risky to talk but I wanted you to know, Annie, that you're never out of my thoughts.
Will we win? -No. -Why not?
-No. -Why not? He's guilty.
The others, they know it.
Annie, if the jury hangs, if there's a mistrial,
then the people I work for, they will hurt you just to punish me.
Hold on a second. That's not part of the deal. I thought if I kept voting not guilty...
That's not part of the deal. I thought if I kept voting not guilty... No, no, we have to have an acquittal.
Do you understand? We have to win this thing.
You're out of your mind. Annie, that's why I chose you.
I chose you over all of the other jurors because I know who you are
I chose you over all of the other jurors because I know who you are -when you wake up. -Look, I can't turn black into white.
-when you wake up. -Look, I can't turn black into white. Louie Boffano could not possibly have done this.
You have to teach them that. He doesn't have the brains, he doesn't have the courage, he's a clown, he's disposable.
he doesn't have the courage, he's a clown, he's disposable.
But you, on the other hand, can do what I'm asking you to do
because you have the spine.
That's what you and I have in common.
We're artists. We're intelligent. We have passion.
We're intelligent. We have passion. But Louie Boffano? Please.
It just isn't possible.
What do you want me to do? Threaten them? The jury is afraid.
They're instinct is to acquit.
They're just waiting for somebody like you to march in there
They're just waiting for somebody like you to march in there and give them the excuse to do it.
I can't.
You will.
I got you something.
And I want you to wear it.
Please take it.
Don't worry. I'll be with you every step of the way.
You're being completely unreasonable.
Two people testified against the Teacher. They talk about him on the tape!
How can you admit he didn't even exist? I don't know who he is!
It doesn't matter who he is! The only thing that matters is you know how powerful he is.
The only thing that matters is you know how powerful he is. Can't you see that? Didn't that get through to you?
-Annie. -What?
-There's no need to raise your voice here. -Sorry.
What, are you crazy? Kayaking? Well, actually, what I love the most is ocean kayaking.
You know, like down South at night.
You know, there's this phosphor in the water...
-What would you like? -Fruit punch.
And it's like...
Thanks. It's, like, lit, you know?
-It's beautiful, it's amazing. -Really? It's an amazing thing to see.
You're pretty wild. You are quite a free spirit.
Well, you know...
You know, I was thinking that maybe, if you'd like,
after this is over, we could go kayaking together on the Hudson sometime.
I'd really like that. That can be really great. Sometime.
Really? That's cool.
Think about how they sounded when they said his name, "The Teacher".
Almost whispering.
And that guy, DeCicco, when he said "The Teacher,"
he was looking around that courtroom and he was scared to death.
-Bullshit. -Hey, take it easy.
Well, no, it's all right. Go ahead, Barry. What?
God damn it. Boffano is the boss! They work for him! Thank you.
I don't know.
I think maybe Annie's got a point here. Again?
Okay. Wait, okay?
They've got all of these deals. Cali, the Calabrians,
the government of... What is that? The government of what? Curaçao, okay, so they've got that, they've got Jamaican runners.
Curaçao, okay, so they've got that, they've got Jamaican runners.
So there this whole huge web
with one spider sitting in the middle of it, one guy scheming this whole thing.
And you think that's Louie Boffano? All right, so the Teacher advises him. Big deal.
The Teacher doesn't advise Boffano.
He told him, "I'm gonna dig a tunnel to Riggio's house and I'm gonna kill him."
But Boffano gave his okay. He said, "Kill that cocksucker."
Okay, so suppose I said, "I'm gonna kill this guy right here."
And you said, "You know what? Great. Do that. Kill that cocksucker."
Now, does that make you a murderer?
I don't believe this. You really want us to let this grease ball go free?
You know, I really don't care for the term grease ball.
All right, I'm sorry. But, I mean, how much goddamn evidence
All right, I'm sorry. But, I mean, how much goddamn evidence -do you people want? -Evidence, you know, that's there...
It isn't what we want. The evidence to get is beyond a reasonable doubt...
"Reasonable." That's what I'm talking about.
Listen. What the hell is reasonable? Use common sense.
Does that mean every infinitesimal, little, teeny bit of goddamn anything that's possible?
teeny bit of goddamn anything that's possible?
-Can I finish, please? -Why should we let you go on and on? You're not saying anything new.
So what are you thinking?
What I'm thinking is these people are scum. And I...
You know what?
I don't care anymore, one way or the other.
I'm tired.
-Reasonable doubt. You got it. -Hold on a minute.
Maybe I don't understand the evidence.
But I know a kid got killed. That's it.
I mean, a little boy.
And if we set this guy free,
I know what he's going to do.
He's going to go right back to selling drugs,
hurting more people.
Annie, I don't need evidence for that.
I know it.
And, Laura, the evidence says that the Teacher ordered the killing,
the evidence says that the Teacher ordered the killing, not Boffano. The Teacher.
Do you have a child? -What does that have to do with it? -It has everything to do with it.
-What does that have to do with it? -It has everything to do with it. I have a boy, Laura.
And I am terrified that something could happen to him some day.
And I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that we've got to protect the children.
There's all of this chaos and it just keeps getting worse and worse.
And there's nowhere to go to get away from it.
But the law says that if they don't prove that Boffano committed the crimes
But the law says that if they don't prove that Boffano committed the crimes he's charged with, prove beyond a reasonable doubt,
then we have to set him free. We have to, even though we hate it.
And you just pray that you get him next time.
But if you twist the law even just a little for the best of reasons...
then the law loses whatever power it's got.
And then my child is in even more danger than before.
And so are your grandchildren.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
do you find the defendant guilty or not guilty?
On both counts, we find the defendant not guilty.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Prisoner is released. This court is adjourned.
-Justice! -Yeah!
You can't have none of him He's our Louie
Sorry Miss DA But I think he's just wrong for you
Welcome home, Louie!
We tipped the scales on our side, eh?
This is to the trial being over.
And to a friend being home. Finally. Drink up.
I got a new boyfriend.
Okay, I know what you're thinking, but he's a very cool guy. Takes pictures, travels around the world.
Takes pictures, travels around the world.
God, I'm having just so much fun right now, I can't stand it.
Are you guys fabulous? Your wonderful personalities are coming right out--
I don't feel like celebrating. Can I be excused?
Congratulations, Louie.
I wasn't concerned, you know? Not for a minute!
I swear, if I'm lying, may God strike me dead on this spot.
Come here, come here.
-Congratulations, Louie. -Wonderful.
You know, that jury lady...
I didn't like the way she looked at me.
She made me a little uncomfortable.
Well, she's afraid of you, Louie. But I wouldn't worry about it. She's not gonna be a problem.
-No problem at all. -"No problem?"
What, is everything no problem to you?
The last time I heard "no problem" from you was with Sal fucking Riggio,
and then there's some kid who was there that you should've known about, but you didn't, and bada-bing my father's on trial for his fucking life!
but you didn't, and bada-bing my father's on trial for his fucking life!
I mean, two made guys whack each other. Who gives a fuck? But you killed a kid.
Now the state's got a hard on for my family ten fucking yards long
because you killed a kid!
You're my son. My son.
What are you gonna do? He worries about me.
He thinks you're a psycho.
Whatever he says, he says out of love for his father, so...
Go ahead. Give me the money.
Are you sure we're not gonna have any problem with this woman?
Don't worry about it, Louie. No problem. I got my eye on her.
Miss Laird, get up quietly, speak to no one. Come with me.
Your bank account shot up to $12,000 last month. -I sold some art work. -Good for you.
-I sold some art work. -Good for you. But you know what?
We don't really care how you got it.
'Cause we don't think you did this for the money.
We think these guys scared you.
They're still scaring you. Now it's time to stop being scared.
Let us get you out of this mess. How would you do that?
You help us, you testify for us,
we're gonna put you somewhere safe. You and your boy.
we're gonna put you somewhere safe. You and your boy. -And then what? -Whatever you want.
-And then what? -Whatever you want. The mob aren't what they used to be, Ms. Laird.
They don't often kill civilians.
Now can I go?
-Not yet. -Yeah, hold it.
Well, then I'd like to make this quick, 'cause I wanna to get home before my kid gets out of school.
Send a car over and have the kid picked up.
No! You just stay away from my house!
You put me in danger when you come around my house,
don't you bastards understand that? In danger, Ms. Laird? From what?
From the man in the moon.
Suppose there were an unfortunate leak to the press to the effect that you were cooperating?
"Juror brings tampering charges against Boffano." That'd make a great story, wouldn't it?
You know, you do this, and they'll kill my child.
No, they won't. You help us, they won't.
They always threaten. Always. But they don't do squat.
Who else is gonna protect you?
Look, I'm not saying no. But I'm gonna need some time to think about this. -How much time? -Just a day or two.
-How much time? -Just a day or two. But you keep your people away from us.
You wanna watch me, okay. But don't you let anybody know you're watching. Do you hear me?
I'll give you 48 hours. When you're ready to talk, find a secure line. Dial this number.
You can trust anybody in this room.
Paul!
I had a shitty day.
-Let's see what we can do about that. -Oh, good.
-Give me another one. -That's a bad idea.
I'm a doctor. I know what I'm doing.
I want you to do something for me.
What else? What else could I possibly do for you?
I want you to take these.
What are they?
Secobarbital and Amobarbital.
Stuff like that.
No, I don't want you to take them for me. I want you to do it for Oliver.
-Who are you? -Well, haven't you figured that out yet?
I'm Annie's friend.
You had all the answers when you told Annie to go see that judge, didn't you?
When you put Oliver at risk. This boy that you care so much about.
Then you had ice in your veins.
Then you wanted to be the big heroine.
Now I'm gonna give you a chance to be a real heroine.
Because after what you've done, this is Oliver's only chance.
I care about him just as much as you do but I will kill him.
I told Annie what would happen if she betrayed us.
And I am a man of my word.
The way of power is the unvarying way.
Now the police are with Annie...
and we have to give her a little taste of grief to save Oliver.
and we have to give her a little taste of grief to save Oliver. Just a little inoculation to make sure she stays afraid.
Just a little inoculation to make sure she stays afraid.
-No! No! -Take it. -No! -Take it. Take it.
Fuck. Help!
Take it.
There. Drink it. Drink.
No one at the hospital would believe it. Why would she kill herself...
She's gone. I don't know if the feds got her in a safe house or something.
But she cleared out all her bank accounts. She took that money you gave her. -And she's gone. -Hey, it's all right.
-And she's gone. -Hey, it's all right. I mean, she's never gonna betray us.
What are you kidding me? She hates our fucking guts.
All she needs is some time to be alone. I'm so sick of that bullshit with you.
How the fuck do you know that? Because a friend of hers died last night.
Who died? The doctor.
Annie is in great danger and her child is in great danger
and I will do everything that I can to protect them.
Now what part of that don't you understand?
I mean, I could explain it to you.
That's all right. I don't need your explanations.
Hello? -Miss Emma Faldo? -Yes, speaking.
-Miss Emma Faldo? -Yes, speaking.
Yes. This is John Slivey in New York.
Your cousin, Annie Laird, was working for me up until about a week ago and she listed you as an emergency contact
and she listed you as an emergency contact and I have a paycheck for her and no way to reach her.
and I have a paycheck for her and no way to reach her. -Do you happen to know where I can... -I'm sorry. I can't help you.
-Do you happen to know where I can... -I'm sorry. I can't help you. -No? -No, I'm sorry.
-Well, that's too bad. -I wish I could be of more help.
Anybody else in the family might know how to... -No, I don't think so. -...reach her?
-Not since... -Really?
It is easy to lose touch.
-Talk about a surprise! -God!
-Uncle Boone. -Oliver! Look at you! Hey!
You guys are gonna love it here.
You know, tomorrow I'm gonna take you to this beautiful Mayan altar.
Wish I had more time!
More time? Annie, when you live here, it's all you have, is time.
I have to go back. And I need you to take care of Oliver.
What? Wait a minute.
Look, you have to do it. There's no one else.
There's no way you're going back. You're not leaving.
-I'm not letting you go back. -It's not your choice.
Your choice is you can take care of Oliver, or you can send him home with me to be killed.
And I'm asking you to take care of Oliver.
I know what I'm asking. I know it's too much.
But there's no one. There's nobody else I've got to go to.
Please. You're my oldest friend. Why do you want to go back?
I have to.
-Hello? -Yeah, she came back.
She what? She came back. Just like you said she would.
Yeah, she wants to meet you tomorrow. One o'clock.
-Hey. -Yeah, I'm here. Why the fuck would she come back?
Well, she had to come back.
She got her child to safety. She took him to this little village in Guatemala.
She took him to this little village in Guatemala.
Some place that I could never find them. And she had to come back.
I mean, everything that we've been through is like a marriage, Annie and I.
She couldn't let it go. She couldn't.
-No, it's too dangerous. -But it's the only way. If he finds out you're wired, you're dead.
He won't. -What if he pats you down? -He won't.
He thinks that I'm timid. He would never touch me unless I wanted him to.
He likes to be thought of as a gentleman. Ms. Laird, I don't wanna lose control here.
I don't wanna put you in an unsafe situation. Oh, and you think that I'm safe here with you?
Listen. Please, just give me the wire.
Please.
I will get you such juicy stuff on Boffano
that you could lock him up for the rest of his fucking life.
You could put them all away.
What do you think of them? My guardians. They're clueless.
My guardians. They're clueless. Incompetent.
They irritate me. You know what irritates me most is their weakness.
Well, I think that you should forgive them. Their hearts are fine and they do love you, Annie.
Don't tell me that.
Don't you talk to me about love and forgiveness.
Oh, you bastard!
I hate you, you know that. I would kill you if I could.
Or is this the lesson for today, Teacher?
Or is it how terror is doing me so much good? How strong it's gonna make me?
Or is it how your love is gonna save my child?
-Annie... -You shut up!
Don't you smile at me.
Don't you ever fucking think you can smile at me.
Don't you even look at me.
You wanna know what I hate most?
I hate that you were right.
I am stronger.
Annie...
Is that all that you feel?
Stop. Just stop.
Do you hear that?
I went back to my studio again. Looked at all my old work.
And it all seemed just so restrained. Smothered.
No fire. No guts. Just the way my life has always been.
Smother the passion. Anything that you're frightened of...
lock it out.
I don't wanna live like that anymore.
I don't want any more weakness.
And this is what I don't understand.
You have all of this strength and you work for Louie Boffano, that...
Goon.
Well, he's your friend.
Louie Boffano doesn't have any friends.
He's a monster. And like most monsters, he commands some respect. But not for long.
My colleagues from Cali are growing very tired of him.
Are you gonna get rid of him?
Well, eventually we'll discard Old Louie, but for the time being, we might keep him as a figure head.
but for the time being, we might keep him as a figure head.
Take the heat off of me. Let him be a mountain. I'll be a ravine.
God, I'd like to have a place like this someday.
With a farmhouse, wood floors,
a child playing in the yard.
A child like Oliver.
And after that, I want nothing... but love.
Do you think I can turn myself into sheer love, Annie?
Do you think I have that power?
I'm sorry that you hate me.
Because I do love you.
What the hell were you doing? The door opens, the door shuts. Then nothing.
Look, Eddie was driving around. The Teacher just never showed up.
Look, maybe he guessed something was going on. How would he guess that?
I don't know. You figure it out. Me, I'm going home.
We're not done yet, Ms. Laird.
Oh, yes, we are.
If you want anything else out of me tonight, you're gonna have to arrest me.
Annie?
Don't call me Annie. Ms. Laird?
Who the hell is this?
-Stop. -It's okay. It's okay. I know her.
-Hey, what are you, deaf? I said stop. -It's okay. -I said stop. -It's okay. I know her.
-You know her? -Yes.
Mr. Boffano, I need to talk to you.
What can I do for you?
Do you recognize me? Yeah, sure. You're the juror lady.
What do you want? I have something to show you.
You got something for me? -What? -A gift.
-What? -A gift.
I give you a gift and you leave me, my friends and my family alone.
Of course. I would never hurt your family, nor you, nor nobody.
I would never hurt your family, nor you, nor nobody.
-Lady, I don't even know you... -Swear it, and I'll give you your gift.
Hey, I'm not interested in your fucking gift. -Oh, yes, you are. -Lady.
Hey, hey. Easy, easy, easy.
She's got something you gotta hear.
-Come here. -Go ahead.
Louie Boffano doesn't have any friends.
He's a monster. And like most monsters, he commands some respect.
But not for long.
My colleagues from Cali are growing very tired of him.
Did you enjoy that, Mr. Boffano?
Would you like to hear more?
When did you tape this? Yesterday.
-And who wired you? -I wired myself.
Let me have it.
-Not until you swear. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, I swear.
-Not until you swear. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, I swear. I'm out of your life forever. Let me have it.
I wouldn't waste any time.
-Vince. -Hey, Ed. What are you doing here? Louie wants to meet.
When? Today. Six o'clock. Palisades.
I don't know. The meetings are so risky, you know.
I mean, can't you just tell him to relax?
Yeah, yeah. Sure, I'll tell him. No, he says it's important.
Why all this urgency?
It's about Annie. He says he can't trust her.
Wants her taken out.
What do you think, Ed? You think she needs to be taken out?
Since when does anybody give a shit what I think? Right?
Well, I mean, you just seemed to have developed a certain amount of fondness for her lately, you know.
Yeah, well, that's history.
It's just business, right?
-Yeah. -Well... Do what you gotta do. Six o'clock, right? Yeah.
Do what you gotta do. Six o'clock, right? Yeah.
So every other day of the year, they call him San Simón, and they treat him with great respect.
But tomorrow, they'll call him by his real name. Judas.
They take him to that tree over there and they hang him.
Oliver? What's wrong?
When's she coming back? -Dr. Boone! Doctor! -Hey, just one second.
-Dr. Boone! Doctor! -Hey, just one second.
Oliver, she left you here because she loves you,
Oliver, she left you here because she loves you, -okay? -Yeah.
Here. Go have some fun, all right. I gotta go deal with this. I'll catch up with you, all right.
I don't think we have to worry about that.
-Yeah. -What's in the case? Open it up.
I'll just have to get back to you.
Vincent. I'm glad you came.
What's this?
I want you to take your money back.
Things got a little more complicated than we hoped, so the money's yours.
Let's walk. We need to talk.
It's more than ten years, we've been working together. Isn't that right?
-Yeah. -You know what...
-Yeah. -You know what... I don't know the first thing about what makes you tick.
Isn't that funny? I mean, in all those ten years, I don't know nothing about you.
Until this woman, I mean, this juror woman,
this morning, to my mother's grave she comes.
-And she says to me-- -What?
Annie came to see you.
She said you've been saying ugly things about me.
Said you called me a motherfucking monster.
Oh, please. Don't even try to deny it.
It's on tape.
That woman, you know the one you've gone soft over,
you think is the love of your life...
she wants you dead.
You said you were gonna discard me.
Now look who gets discarded.
Get it done.
And everybody thought you were a genius.
Hey, Joseph. Take a look at your father.
You're fucking crazy.
Bada-bing!
-Eddie? -No, it is not Eddie.
-Eddie? -No, it is not Eddie. He's right here. Would you like to speak with him?
Annie, I suppose I should be angry with you for betraying me, but I'm not.
I know that this has been hard for you.
I did things to protect you and Oliver.
It must have been difficult for you to grasp.
What you would say, what you would do to protect your child.
What you would say, what you would do to protect your child. I mean, you bring Oliver down to Guatemala and then what?
You're gonna come back here and you're gonna destroy me?
Well, that is not going to happen. Do you remember what I told you at the studio that night?
I told you if you would trust me, then Oliver would be safe. But if you betrayed me, then no matter what the personal cost to me,
But if you betrayed me, then no matter what the personal cost to me, Oliver would suffer. Do you remember that?
And I begged you to believe me. But how can I ask you to trust me
when mistrust and betrayal are rooted in your character.
I can just as easily ask you to change the pattern of the stars.
But now Oliver is going to die in the morning. We both know that.
And there's nothing we can do to stop that.
We can only witness.
Enjoy your flight, Mr. Wordham. You can board now.
Here's my ticket. I'm sorry, you've just missed this flight.
-Ma'am? -Look, I have to... My son is dying, okay. I got to get to the gate. No, ma'am. I'm sorry. Well, we can put you on another flight.
No, ma'am. I'm sorry. Well, we can put you on another flight.
If you hurry, there's another flight to Guatemala via Houston.
-Where? What gate? -126.
-Habla inglés? -Yes, I do.
-What's your name, man? -Danielle.
You think I could hire you to give me a ride somewhere?
No, I'll give you a ride. You don't have to pay. It will be a long journey.
Can I have a car?
I got to have a car. I have a lot of money. I just need one car.
I have a lot of money. I just need one car.
Look, I don't care. Here's everything I've got, okay. Just get me there.
Oliver?
Oliver?
What is this? A fucking zoo?
-Annie! -Get back, Boone. Right now.
-Mom! -Oliver, get out of here. Get him out of here! Get him out of here!
-Let go! Mom! Get off! -Annie!
Annie, you really are astonishing.
I mean, you won over the jury...
and then you set me up with Boffano.
And now you've chartered a plane. Yep. With your money.
But you're right, Annie. You have to kill me.
I see that now. It has to be that way.
Because if you shoot me...
then you and I will be bonded forever.
No, we won't!
We do honor to your courage and speed, your strength.
CHINGACHGOOK [IN ENGLISH]: Hello! John Cameron!
JOHN: Chingachgook. How are you?
CHINGACHGOOK: The Master of Life is good, John.
Another year passed.
-How is it with you? JOHN: Getting along. Yes, I am.
JOHN: Nathaniel.
HAWKEYE: Hello, John. Cleared another quarter, I see.
JOHN: Yes, I did.
-Alexandra. -Welcome.
HAWKEYE: Jack. How are you? JACK: Hello, Nathaniel.
-How've you been? -Good, thank you.
JOHN: Where have you boys been trapping?
CHINGACHGOOK: West of the Concanoga.
ALEXANDRA: Why is Uncas with you?
He should have settled with a woman, started a family by now.
GIRL: Hey. Hey, Uncas, look.
Mohawk field we saw was five-mile long on the river.
Chief Joseph Brandt's field.
ALEXANDRA: Take much fur? -That we did.
-Lots. -The Horican is near trapped out.
Where're you trading? Castleton?
-Schuylerville. -Schuylerville, with the Dutch for silver.
French and English want to pay with wampum and brandy.
So, what is it, Jack? What brings you here?
French and Indian army are heading south
out of Fort Carillon to war against the British.
I'm helping raise New York's militia to fill the Crown's levy.
Are the people here gonna join in that fight?
JACK: We'll see in the morning.
Where you boys heading?
HAWKEYE: We'll trap over the fall and winter in Can-tuck-ee.
Find a Delaware-speaking woman for Uncas.
She will say, "You are the one." Bear him many children.
JAMES: Then you can have a boy like me.
UNCAS: Never. You're too strong.
-Turn me old too fast. ALEXANDRA: That's what he's doing to his mama.
ONGEWASGONE: John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality.
Mohawk got no quarrel with Les Français. Traded furs with Les Français.
Now, Les Français bring Huron, Ottawa, Abenaki onto Mohawk land.
Now Mohawk will fight Les Français and Huron.
I speak for the Twin River Mohawk of the Six Nations.
His Majesty King George II is very grateful for your support.
How far up the valley?
-Up to Fort William Henry. MAN 1: That's two nights and a bit from here.
Should be enough to remind you France is our enemy.
MAN 2: France is your enemy.
LIEUTENANT: What did you say?
While we're at your fort, what if the French attack our homes?
-What then, lieutenant? -For your homes, for King, for country!
That's why you men ought to join this fight!
HAWKEYE: You do what you want with your own scalp.
Do not be telling us what we ought to do with ours.
You call yourself a patriot? And loyal subject to the Crown?
I do not call myself subject to much at all.
I agree with some of what Nathaniel and John say.
But I believe England's still our sovereign.
MAN 3: I'll go. MAN 4: We're gonna go fight the French.
MAN 5: My brother and I will volunteer. MAN 6: I'll fight with you, Jack.
JOHN: I'm staying on my farm.
Any man who goes, his family's welcome to fort up with us till he comes back.
Boys, my sense of it is, we have enough here to fill the county levy.
It's a fight we ought to make.
First, we've got to get terms from General Webb.
MAN 7: What terms? MAN 8: Where are you meeting him?
We'll go to Albany.
GUARD: Attention!
-Help my men outside with the baggage. -Yes, sir.
If they're not allowed leave
to defend their families and homes if the French attack,
no colonial militia is going to the Fort William Henry.
They will report or be pressed into service.
I cannot imagine His Majesty, in all his benevolence, would ever object
to his loyal American subjects defending their hearth and home,
their women and children.
Does that mean they'll be granted leave to defend their homes
if the settlements are attacked?
Of course.
You got yourself a colonial militia, general.
MAN: Tis what we wanted.
Major Duncan Heyward reporting, sir.
En route to Fort William Henry and bearing dispatches.
Safe journey, I trust?
DUNCAN: Yes, and I didn't experience anything so surprising
from Bristol to Albany as that, that I witnessed here today.
And what was that?
The Crown negotiating the terms of service.
I know. One has to reason with these colonials to get them to do anything.
Tiring, isn't it? But that's the lay of the land.
I thought British policy is "Make the world England," sir.
I see you're to serve with the 35th Regiment of Foot
at Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro.
I'll be marching the 60th to Fort Edward.
Explain to the major he has little to fear
from this General Marquis de Montcalm in the first place,
and therefore scant need of a colonial militia in the second
because the French haven't the nature for war.
They'd rather eat and make love with their faces than fight.
Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters?
I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
You there. Uh, what does Munro call you?
The Scotsman has sent you one of his Mohawk allies to guide you.
Magua.
WEBB: The Scotsman's daughters are at the poltroon's house.
A company of the 60th will accompany you,
and Magua will show you the way.
Dawn, at the encampment, 6 a.m. sharp. See to it you're there.
SERVANT: I'll take it for you, sir.
Cora.
Duncan.
-How long have you been in Albany? -For days and days. And yourself?
Just arrived.
By God, it's good to see you.
I don't know what to say, Duncan.
I truly wish they did, but my feelings...
don't go beyond friendship.
Don't you see?
Respect and friendship. Isn't that a reasonable basis
for a man and a woman to be married? All else may grow in time.
-Some say that's the way of it. -Some?
-Cousin Eugenie, my father-- -Well, then, Cora...
in my heart, I know.
Once we're joined, we'll be the most marvelous couple in London.
I'm certain of that.
So why not let those whom you trust, your father,
help settle what's best for you?
In view of your indecision, you should rely on their judgment.
And mine.
Will you consider that?
Please consider that.
Yes.
Yes, I will.
ALICE: Duncan!
DUNCAN: By God, you've grown up.
ALICE: We leave in the morning?
-Yes, miss. -I shan't sleep tonight.
What an adventure. Have you seen the red men?
A few.
ALICE: I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square,
having been to the wilderness. It's so exciting.
Alice?
ALICE: Can we rest soon? DUNCAN: Absolutely.
You there.
Scout.
We must stop soon. Women are tired.
MAGUA: Not here. Two leagues. Better water. We stop there.
DUNCAN: No, stop in the glade just ahead.
When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
[IN HURON] Magua understand white man is a dog to his women.
When they want to eat, he puts down his tomahawk to feed their laziness.
Excuse me, what did you say?
[IN ENGLISH] Magua said, "I understand English very well."
MAN: All company on the center!
Right! Step to the right!
Prepare your firearms!
Make ready!
MAN: Make ready!
Right, men. Close your rank!
DUNCAN: Fire!
No, Duncan.
In case your aim's any better than your judgment.
Your wounded should try walking on back to Albany.
They'll never make a passage north.
ALICE: Stop it! Stop it! We need them to get out!
DUNCAN: Why's he loosing the horses? -Why don't you ask him?
Too easy to track.
They'll be heard for miles.
Find yourself a musket.
We were headed to Fort William Henry.
We'll take you as far as the fort.
We're walking out of here fast.
Unless all of you'd rather wait for the next Huron war party to come by.
Scout, I'd like to thank you for your help. How much further is it?
A night and a bit.
Appears we're well away from them.
Maybe. Maybe they ain't alone.
-That Huron captain back there-- -The guide? He's a Mohawk.
No Mohawk, he's Huron. What reason did he have to murder the girl?
What?
The dark-haired one.
Miss Cora Munro? Murder her? He never set eyes on her before today.
She's only been here a week.
No blood vengeance? No reproach or insult?
Of course not.
How is it you were so nearby?
Came across the war party. Tracked them.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
No.
Fort Edward, then?
Heading west for Can-tuck-ee.
There is a war on. How is it you are heading west?
Well, we kind of face to the north, and real sudden like, turn left.
I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia.
The militia is fighting the French in the north.
I ain't your scout. And we sure ain't in no damn militia.
Clear it up any?
Ottawa, two Français.
DUNCAN: What did you say?
Mirrors, tools.
And clothes.
Everything was inside. They didn't take anything.
They were moving fast.
Another war party.
Let us look after them.
CHINGACHGOOK: Leave them.
CORA: Whoever they are, though they're strangers,
they're at least entitled to a Christian burial.
-They can't be left behind. -Let us go, miss.
I will not. I've seen the face of war before, sir,
but I've not seen war made upon women and children.
And almost as cruel is your indifference.
Miss Munro.
They're not strangers.
And they stay as they lay.
Why didn't you bury those people?
Anyone looking for our trail would see it as a sign we'd passed that way.
You knew them well?
You were acting for our benefit and I apologize.
I misunderstood you.
Well, that's to be expected.
-My father warned me about-- -Your father?
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
Oh, he did?
-He said, "Do not try to understand them." -What?
Yes, and, "Do not try to make them understand you.
That is because they are a breed apart and make no sense."
CORA: Why did they turn back?
Burial ground.
A breed apart, we make no sense?
In your particular case, miss, I'd make allowance.
Thank you so much.
Where's your real family?
They buried my ma and pa and my sisters.
Chingachgook found me with two French trappers, raised me up as his own.
I'm sorry.
I do not remember them. I wasn't but 1 or 2.
How did you learn English?
My father sent Uncas and I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was 10.
Why were those people living in this defenseless place?
After seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed here
because the frontier's the only land available to poor people.
Out here, they're beholden to none.
Not living by another's leave.
Their name was Cameron.
John and Alexandra Cameron.
My father's people say that at the birth of the sun
and of his brother, the moon, their mother died.
So the sun gave to the earth her body, from which was to spring all life.
And he drew forth from her breast the stars.
The stars he threw into the night sky to remind him of her soul.
So there's the Camerons' monument.
My folks' too, I guess.
You are right, Mr. Poe.
We do not understand what is happening here.
And it's not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London.
-Sorry to disappoint you. -No, on the contrary.
It is more deeply stirring to my blood...
than any imagining could possibly have been.
HAWKEYE: Top of the next ridge. The fort's downhill of it.
DUNCAN: The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires
and provide every comfort you desire.
I cannot wait to see Papa.
MAN: Fire!
Fire!
What now?
-I'm Major Duncan Heyward. -Captain Jeffrey Beams.
-We didn't expect you to make it through. DUNCAN: Where's Colonel Munro?
Go, boys!
Nathaniel!
It's torture, Jack!
IAN: Uncas! Thought you and Nathaniel weren't joining up.
We didn't. Just dropped in to see how you boys is doing.
Papa! Papa!
Alice! Cora! Why are you here?
And where the hell are my reinforcements?
Get Mr. Phelps.
I told you to stay away.
Why did you disobey me, girls?
When? How? I...
-My letter. -There was none.
MUNRO: What? -There was no letter.
I sent three couriers to Webb.
DUNCAN: One called Magua arrived. CORA: He delivered no such message.
-Does Webb not know we are besieged? -Sir, Webb has no idea.
He certainly does not know to send reinforcements.
-What happened to you? -On the George Road. Attacked.
We're fine.
-Are you all right? -Yes.
What will happen here, Papa?
-We'll be all right, girl. DUNCAN: This Magua led us into it.
Eighteen killed. These men came to our aid. They guided us here.
MUNRO: Thank you.
Do you need anything?
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores?
And some food.
Indebted to you.
PHELPS: Miss Cora, how are you?
Hello, Mr. Phelps.
PHELPS: Mrs. McCann will get dry clothes for you. CORA: Thank you.
Go with your sister, Alice.
It'll be all right, girl.
It'll be all right.
Might I inquire after the situation, sir,
given that I've seen the French engineering from the ridge above?
The situation is, his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them.
They keep our heads down while his troops dig 30 yards of trench a day.
When those trenches are 200 yards from the fort and within range,
he'll bring in his 15-inch mortars, lob explosive rounds over our walls
and pound us to dust.
They look to be 300 yards out.
If they're digging 30 yards a day, you have three days.
Damn. Damn.
A man here can make a run straight through to Webb.
MUNRO: Three days isn't enough to get to Albany and back with reinforcements.
Webb's not in Albany.
He marched the 60th to Fort Edward two days ago.
-Webb is at Edward? -Yes, sir.
That's only 12 miles away.
He could have reinforcements here the day after tomorrow.
You, sir. Pick your man.
Major Heyward will provide a diversion. I'll draft out a dispatch.
Captain Beams will seek you out and give it to you later.
Something else. Cameron's cabin. Frontier cabin. Came upon it yesterday.
It was burnt out, everyone murdered.
It was Ottawa, allied to the French.
Aye.
So?
It was a war party.
That means they're gonna be attacking up and down the frontier.
Thank you, sir.
People here,
-Mohawks, settlers, have family out there. -That'll be all, sir.
Things were done. Nobody was spared.
Those considerations are subordinate to the interests of the Crown.
A terrible feature of war here in the Americas, Major Heyward.
Best keep your eye fixed on our duty, to defeat France.
That hangs on a courier to Webb.
I will give you three oxen for a feast, and tomorrow,
I will sing the war song with you at the Great Council Fire.
Magua?
How are things with your English friends?
MAGUA: The English war chief, Webb, goes to Fort Edward with 60th Regiment.
He does not know that my father's army attacks Fort William Henry.
Magua was successful?
The other two couriers died in the forest.
By now, Munro would know his dispatch did not get through.
He'll send another.
The Grey Hair will try.
BOUGAINVILLE: Four or five, including two women, entered the fort.
The Grey Hair's children were under Magua's knife. They escaped.
They will be under it again.
Why do you hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart.
Before he dies, Magua will put his children under the knife
so the Grey Hair will know his seed is wiped out forever.
PHELPS: Miss Cora?
-Gentleman looking for you. -Miss Munro.
Hello.
May I?
It will seep and then it's going to draw.
UNCAS: Thank you, miss.
About done holding hands with Miss Munro?
We got some work to do.
What are you looking at, sir?
I'm looking at you, miss.
UNCAS: Munro refused to believe what happened.
He does not even want to hear it.
Well, he's gonna have to.
Get together by the west bastion. Ian, Sharitarish, Ongewasgone, and William.
UNCAS: Tight weave.
Silk. Another 40 yards.
MUNRO: And how am I to know it wasn't a raid by common thieves?
HAWKEYE: The cabin was attacked by a war party fighting with the French.
They're sweeping south down the frontier, attacking farms and Mohawk villages.
-All the men are stuck here. -I need proof more convincing
than this man's opinion before I weaken the fort's defenses
by releasing the militia.
Chingachgook's of the same opinion about the raid.
Taken together, that's gospel.
Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb's reinforcements,
-not the presence of the colonials. -I judge military matters here, not you.
Your judgment is not more important than their right under agreement
with Webb to defend their farms and families.
Major Heyward was there. He was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
MUNRO: What exactly did you see, major?
I saw nothing that would lead me to the conclusion it was other than
a raid by savages bent on thievery.
HAWKEYE: You're a liar.
Major!
Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman, not a butcher.
Easy for you to suppose. It's their women and children alone, not yours.
-You forget yourself, sir. -We're not forgetting Webb's promise.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released.
Because I need more definite proof than this man's word.
Nathaniel's word's been good on this frontier long before you got here.
This meeting is over. The militia stays.
Does the rule of English law no longer govern?
Has it been replaced by absolutism?
If English law cannot be trusted,
these people would do better making peace with the French.
That is sedition!
-That is the truth. -I'll have you beaten from this fort.
Someday, you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
Anyone advocating the leaving of Fort William Henry will be hung for sedition.
Anyone actually caught leaving will be shot for desertion.
And my decision is final. Get out.
Cora.
I wanted to talk to you.
ALICE: Talk to Duncan, Cora.
I must manage.
I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl.
-Alice. -I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
Cora, when we come together back in England,
and are married and away from this place,
what had to be done and said here will matter not at all.
-I'm certain of that. -Duncan, I promised you an answer.
You've complimented me with your persistence and patience.
The decision I have come to is that
I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than to surrender my own judgment.
Please take this as my final answer.
It must be no.
I see.
IAN: Yeah, Nathaniel, but you weren't ever for being here.
HAWKEYE: That's right. I saw it that way then and I see it that way now.
Ian, if I had kin in the settlements, hell, I'd be damn sure I'd be long gone.
What do we do about being under Crown law?
I believe if they set aside their law, as and when they wish,
their law no longer has rightful authority over us.
All they have over us then is tyranny.
And I will not live under that yoke. So I will stay here no longer.
Anyone caught leaving could be shot,
so each man make your own decision. Those who are going, be back in an hour.
Out the northern sally-port.
Strike for the east side of the swamp till you clear the French picket line.
Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast.
Fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers.
Should've skinned out of this long ago.
Got no families, captain.
Figured we'd stay and give a hand.
I'll cover you from the top of the bastion.
You're not coming with us?
I got a reason to stay.
That reason wear a striped skirt and work in the surgery?
If it does, no offense,
but it's a better-looking reason than you, Jack Winthrop.
Push hard because you've got to clear the French outpost by dawn.
Good luck, Jack.
Lord have mercy on us.
He was so brave. You should have seen him.
-Ongewasgone, are you staying? -Yes.
There's too many French.
And so few of us to fight. Not too many to die.
But we've given our word to our English fathers.
SERGEANT: You, sir. As you were!
Stand off.
Take him.
[IN MOHICAN] Why do they make my white son prisoner?
[IN MOHICAN] I helped Jack and the others leave...
As you were.
This fight is not yours.
I love you and my brother.
And you should leave this place now...
What will they do to my white son?
CORA: He saved us. We're alive only because of him.
The man encouraged the colonials to desert,
in this very room and in my presence.
-Sir! -He's guilty of sedition.
He must be tried and hanged like any criminal,
regardless of what he did for my children.
But he knew the consequences, and he stayed.
Are those the actions of a criminal?
-Duncan, do something. -He knew the penalty for his actions.
He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
You know he wouldn't send me. You falsely spoke of what you saw.
What happened at the farm was as Nathaniel said.
But not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
And who empowered these colonials to pass judgment on England's policies
in her own possessions, and to come and go without so much as a by-your-leave?
They do not live their lives by your leave!
They hack it out of the wilderness with their own hands,
burying their children along the way.
You're defending him because you've become infatuated with him!
Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable qualities.
Taken as a whole, I was wrong to have thought so highly of you.
MUNRO: Cora!
Cora.
I would do anything I could to keep you from being hurt.
But this man is guilty of sedition
and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
Justice? If that's justice, then the sooner French guns
blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for people here.
MUNRO: You don't know what you're saying! -I know exactly what I'm saying!
And if it's sedition, then I am guilty of sedition too.
They're going to hang you.
Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
Because what I'm interested in is right here.
What can I do?
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.
If they do not arrive, the fort will fall to the French.
If that happens, stay close to your father.
Stay close to him.
The French officers will try to protect the officers among the English.
No. I will find you.
Do not.
Promise me.
The whole world's on fire, isn't it?
CORA: What is it?
Remember what I told you.
Stay close to your father and the officers.
SERGEANT: Company! Left face!
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist.
I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
And I yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your prince.
But now I beg you to listen to the admonishments of humanity.
I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Perhaps the general's glass can reach as far as the Hudson
and seize the size and eminence of the army of Webb.
My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended for you.
Captain de Bougainville.
"To Colonel Munro:
Sir, I regret to inform you that I have no men available
to send to your rescue.
It is quite impossible. I advise you to seek terms for surrender.
I remain, Jerome Webb, at Fort Edward."
This is the signature of Webb. And I know the temper of our men.
Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay,
they'd fight to the end.
You've heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis.
Sir, I beg you not to sign the death warrant of so many until you have listened
Sir, I beg you not to sign the death warrant of so many until you have listened to what I have to say.
Go on.
None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They are free,
so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent
and the civilian militia return to their farms.
-Their arms? -They may leave the fortress fully armed.
-My colors? -Carry them to England with pride.
Allow me to consult with my officers.
I have lived to see something which I never expected.
A British officer afraid to support another.
DUNCAN: Webb can burn in hell.
And we'll go back and dig our graves behind those ramparts.
MUNRO: Death and honor are thought to be the same...
but today I have learned that sometimes they are not.
DUNCAN: Sir.
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
Yes.
Not a warrior has a scalp, and the white men become friends.
My master owns these lands, and I have been ordered to drive off
the English squatters.
They have consented to go, so now I call them enemies no longer.
Magua took the hatchet to color with blood. It's still bright.
Only when it's red, then it will be buried.
So many suns have set since Magua struck the war post.
And where is that sun?
Magua is the son of his people, and he has come to lead many of them.
But Magua has power with his Huron people and others here, I know well.
Magua's village and lodges were burnt.
Magua's children were killed by the English.
I was taken as slave by the Mohawk who fought for the Grey Hair.
Magua's wife believed he was dead...
and became the wife of another.
The Grey Hair was the father of all that.
In time, Magua became blood brother to the Mohawk...
In time, Magua became blood brother to the Mohawk... to become free.
But always in his heart, he is Huron.
And his heart will be whole again on the day the Grey Hair
and all his seed are dead.
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
Colonel Munro would.
But General Webb will not honor the agreement
and send their soldiers away.
I fear having let them go, which I must,
I will only fight the same men again when I drive towards Albany.
MUNRO: Monsieur, the fort is yours.
SERGEANT: Ready!
Ready, set...
MAN 1: I can't see them.
MAN 2: Let's go!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
MAGUA: Grey Hair.
Before you die, know that I will put under the knife your children,
so I will wipe your seed from the earth forever.
CORA: Leave her alone!
Got nothing better to do on the lake today, major?
When you fall into British hands again, I'll have you hanged!
Faster!
Head for the river!
DUNCAN: Where are we going? HAWKEYE: Nowhere.
DUNCAN: I don't understand. HAWKEYE: This is as far as we go.
If we're lucky, they'll figure we beached our canoes and headed across land.
If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
Our only hope is they pass us by.
If they do?
Take the south rim down the mountain.
It's 12 miles cross-country to Fort Edward.
And if they don't?
You'll just have to forego the pleasure of hanging me.
Powder.
Done.
Mine's soaking wet!
CORA: Our father!
Did you see my father?
From a distance.
Say nothing to Alice.
UNCAS: Get back!
Yes. Go ahead!
What the bloody-hell plan is this?
I want you to go.
If we go, there's a chance there won't be a fight.
There's no powder! If we don't go, then there's no chance! None!
-You understand? -Coward!
You've done everything you can do. Save yourself.
If the worst happens, if only one of us survives,
something of the other does too.
No, you stay alive!
If they don't kill you, they'll take you north up to the Huron lands.
You submit, do you hear? You're strong. You survive!
You stay alive, no matter what occurs!
I will find you.
No matter how long it takes, no matter how far.
I will find you.
[IN HURON] Your tomahawks are red...
[IN HURON] Many of the English are dead, great Sachem.
And Magua has become a great war leader and seeks your acknowledgment.
And so, I have brought three of my prisoners, to honor you.
Magua will sell the English officer to the French.
And the reward is my gift to you, wise one.
The women are the children of the white war chief, Munro.
They will burn in our fires. Then all can share in these trophies of honor.
HAWKEYE: Do you speak French, major? DUNCAN: Yes.
Translate for me into French every word as I say it.
I come to you unarmed and in peace to unstop your ears, Sachem.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free.
Take fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
[IN FRENCH] Montcalm and our friends, the French, are stronger than the English.
We do not fear English anger.
Sachem, the French fathers made peace. Magua broke it.
It is false that the French will be friends still to the Huron.
It made our French father happy to know
that he would never have to fight the same English again.
Now, the French also fear Huron. That is good.
When the Huron is stronger from their fear,
we will make the new terms of trade with the French.
We will become traders as the whites.
Take land from the Abenaki, furs from the Osage, Sauk and Fox.
Trade for gold.
No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
Would Magua use the ways of Les Français and the Yengeese?
-Would you? -[IN ENGLISH] Yes!
Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy
and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?
Would Huron have greed for more land than a man can use?
Would Huron fool Seneca into taking all the furs of the animals of the forest
for beads and strong whiskey?
Would the Huron kill every man, woman and child of their enemy?
Those are the ways of the Yengeese,
and the Français traders and their masters in Europe
infected with the sickness of greed.
Magua's heart is twisted.
He would make himself into what twisted him.
I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese.
Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook of the Mohican people.
Let the children of the dead Munro and the Yengeese officer go free.
This belt, which is a record of the days of my father's people,
speaks for my truth.
You speak poison with two tongues.
[IN FRENCH] The white man came and night...
entered our future with him.
Our council has asked the question since I was a boy.
What are the Huron to do?
Magua is a great warrior captain, but his path has never been the Huron one.
Magua take younger daughter of Munro,
so that Munro's seed doesn't die and Magua's heart is healed.
English officer will go back to English so their hatred burns less bright.
Dark child of Munro will burn in fire for Magua's dead children.
Long Rifle, go in peace.
Tell him I'll trade him. Me for her!
[IN FRENCH] Take me! A British officer. Me for her.
CORA: Alice!
We will go west to the Huron of the Lakes. This is not the voice of wisdom.
You are women. Slaves. Dogs. I spit on you.
HAWKEYE: Stop him.
I am La Longue Carabine! My death is a great honor to the Huron!
Take me!
Did you tell him?
DUNCAN: Yes.
CORA: Stop.
I said to take me.
-Take me! -My compliments, sir! Take her and get out!
Duncan! What are they doing to Duncan? Where's Alice?
Alice!
Uncas!
[IN ENGLISH] Great Spirit and the Maker of all Life...
a warrior goes to you swift and straight as an arrow shot into the sun.
Welcome him, and let him take his place at the Council Fire of my people.
He is Uncas...
my son.
Tell him to be patient and ask death for speed,
-What? -We are three wise men.
Well, what are you doing creeping around a cowshed at two o'clock in the morning?
That doesn't sound very wise to me.
We are astrologers.
We have come from the East.
Is this some kind of joke?
We wish to praise the infant.
We must pay homage to him.
Homage?! You're all drunk!
It's disgusting! Out! Come on, out!
Bursting in here with tales about Oriental fortune-tellers! Come on, out!
No, no, we must see him.
Go and praise someone else's brat! Go on!
We were led by a star!
Led by a bottle more like! Go on, out!
We must see him. We have brought presents!
-Out! -Gold, frankincense, myrrh!
Well, why didn't you say? He's over there.
Sorry the place is a bit of a mess.
Well, what is myrrh anyway?
-It is a valuable balm. -A balm?!
What are you giving him a balm for? It might bite him!
-What? -That's a dangerous animal!
-Quick, throw it in the trough! -No, it isn't!
Yes, it is. It's a great big--
[man] No, no, no, it is an ointment.
Well, there is an animal called a balm, or did I dream it?
So you're astrologers, are you? Well, what is he then?
Hmm? What star-sign is he?
[stammers] Capricorn.
Oh, Capricorn, eh? What are they like?
Well, he's the son of God. Our Messiah.
King of the Jews!
And that's Capricorn, is it?
No, no, no, that's just him.
Oh! I was gonna say, otherwise there'd be a lot of them.
By what name are you calling him?
Uh, Brian.
[all] We worship you, oh, Brian, who are lord over us all.
Praise unto you, Brian, and to the Lord, our Father. Amen.
-Do you do a lot of this? -What?
-This praising. -No, no. No, no.
Oh, well, um, if you're dropping by again, do pop in. [chuckles]
And thanks a lot for the gold and frankincense,
uh, but don't worry too much about the myrrh next time, all right?
Thank you. Goodbye.
Well, weren't they nice? Hmm.
Out of their bloody minds, but, still, look at that!
[laughs] Here! Here, that's mine! Hey! Hey!
Here, that's mine! Hey! Hey!

How blessed are the sorrowful.

How blessed are those of gentle spirit.
They shall have the earth for their possession.
How blessed are those who hunger
and thirst to see right prevail.
They shall be satisfied.
How blessed are those whose hearts are pure.
They shall see God.
-Speak up! -Shh!
Quiet, Mum!
Well, I can't hear a thing.
-Let's go to stoning. -Shh!
You can go to a stoning anytime.
Oh, come on, Brian.
Will you be quiet?!
Don't pick your nose!
I wasn't picking my nose, I was scratching.
You was picking it while you was talking to that lady.
-I wasn't! -Leave it alone. Give it a rest.
Do you mind? I can't hear a word he's saying.
Don't you "do you mind" me. I was talking to my husband.
Well, go and talk to him somewhere else. I can't hear a bloody thing.
Don't you swear at my wife.
I was only asking her to shut up so we can hear what he's saying, Big Nose.
Don't you call my husband "Big Nose"!
Well, he has got a big nose.
Could you be quiet, please? What was that?
I don't know, I was too busy talking to Big Nose.
I think it was, "Blessed are the cheese makers."
What's so special about the cheese makers?
Well, obviously it's not meant to be taken literally.
It refers to any manufacturers of dairy products.
See, if you hadn't been going on, we'd have heard that, Big Nose.
Hey, say that once more, I'll smash your bloody face in!
Better keep listening, might be a bit about "Blessed are the big noses".
Oh, lay off him.
Oh, you're not so bad yourself, Conkface.
Where are you two from, Nose City?
One more time, mate, I'll take you to the fucking cleaners!
Language!
And don't pick your nose!
I wasn't going to pick my nose. I was gonna thump him!
Hear that? Blessed are the Greek.
-The Greek? -Mm-hmm.
Well, apparently, he's gonna inherit the Earth.
Did anyone catch his name?
You aren't going to thump anybody.
I'll thump him if he calls me "Big Nose" again!
Oh, shut up, Big Nose!
Oh! Right, I warned you. I really will slug you so hard--
Oh, it's the meek!
"Blessed are the meek."
Oh, that's nice, isn't it?
I'm glad they're getting something, 'cause they have a hell of a time.
Listen, I'm only telling the truth, you have got a very big nose.
Hey, your nose is going to be three-foot wide across your face
-by the time I'm finished with you! -Shh!
Who hit yours then, Goliath's big brother?
Oh! Right, that's your last warning.
Oh, do pipe down.
Silly bitch, getting in the way.
Break it up!
-Oh, come on, let's go to the stoning. -All right.
Well, blessed is just about everyone
with a vested interest in the status quo, as far as I can tell, Reg.
Yeah. Well, what Jesus blatantly fails to appreciate
is it's the meek who are the problem.
Yes, yes. Absolutely, Reg. Yes, I see.
Oh, come on, Brian, or they'll have stoned him before we get there.
-All right. -[commotion continues]
Hey, get off her. That's disgusting. Stop trying to do that.
Officer, intervene here. Attempted rape going on.
It's the chap with the big nose's fault. He started it all.
Oh, I hate wearing these beards.
Why aren't women allowed to go to stonings, Mum?
It's written, that's why.
-Beard, madam? -Oh, look,
I haven't got time to go to no stonings.
He's not well again.
Stone, sir?
Stone, sir? No, they've got them up there lying around on the ground.
Oh, not like these, sir. Look at these.
Feel the quality of that. That's craftsmanship, sir.
Hmm... uh... All right. We'll have two with points and a big, flat one.
-Could I have a flat one, Mum? -Shh!
Sorry. Dad.
All right. Two points, two flats -and a packet of gravel. -Packet of gravel.
-and a packet of gravel. -Packet of gravel.
-Should be a good one this afternoon. -Yeah?
-Local boy. -Oh, good.
Enjoy yourselves.
Matthias, son of Deuteronomy of Gath...
Do I say yes?
-Yes! -Yes!
...you have been found guilty by the elders of the town
of uttering the name of our Lord,
and so as a blasphemer...
...you are to be stoned to death!
Look, I'd had a lovely supper, and all I said to my wife was,
"That piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah."
Blasphemy! He said it again!
-Did you hear him? -[all shout in feminine voices] Yeah! Yes, we did!
[high-pitched scream] Really!
Are there any women here today?
[quietly] No, no, no.
Very well.
By virtue of the authority -vested in me... -Ow!
Lay off! We haven't started yet.
Come on! Who threw that?
Who threw that stone? Come on!
[all in feminine voices] She did! She did!
[all continue in masculine voices] He did! He did! He did!
Sorry, I thought we'd started.
-Go to the back. -Oh, dear.
Always one, isn't there?
Now, where were we?
Look, I don't think it ought to be blasphemy just saying "Jehovah".
-[angry shouting] -[all shout in feminine voices] He did it again!
You're only making it worse for yourself!
Making it worse?! How could it be worse?
-Jehovah! Jehovah! Jehovah! -[crowd gasps]
I'm warning you! If you say Jehovah once more--
Right! Who threw that?
Come on! Who threw that?
[all continue in masculine voices] Him! Him! Him!
-Was it you? -Yes.
-Right-- -Well, you did say Jehovah.
Stop! Stop! Will you stop that?!
Stop it!
Now, look! No one is to stone anyone
until I blow this whistle! Do you understand?
Even, and I want to make this absolutely clear,
even if they do say "Jehovah"!
-[crowd applauds] -[woman] Good shot!
-Have I got a big nose, Mum? -Oh, stop thinking about sex.
-I wasn't! -You're always on about it.
Morning, noon and night.
"Will the girls like this, will the girls like that?
Is it too big, is it too small?"
-Alms for a leper. -Alms for a leper.
Alms for an ex-leper.
Bloody donkey-owners, all the same, ain't they?
Never have any change.
Oh, here's a touch.
Spare a talent for an old ex-leper?
Buzz off!
Spare a talent for an old ex-leper?
A talent? That's more than he earns in a month.
-Half a talent then? -No, go away.
-Come on, big nose, let's haggle. -What?
All right, cut the haggling, say you open at one shekel,
I start at 2000, we close about 1800.
-No. -Seventeen fifty?
-Go away! -Seventeen forty?
Will you leave him alone!
All right. Two shekels, just two. Is this fun, eh?
Look, he's not giving you any money. Now piss off!
All right, final offer, half a shekel for an ex-leper?
Did you say "ex-leper"?
That's right, sir, 16 years behind a bell and proud of it, sir.
-Well, what happened? -I was cured, sir.
-Cured? -Yes, a bloody miracle, sir.
-God bless you. -Who cured you?
Jesus did, sir.
I was hopping along, minding my own business.
All of a sudden, up he comes, cures me.
One minute I'm a leper with a trade, next minute my livelihood's gone.
Not so much as a "by your leave."
"You're cured, mate." Bloody do-gooder.
Well, why don't you go and tell him that you want to be a leper again?
I could do that, sir. Yeah, I could that, I suppose.
What I was thinking was gonna ask him if he'd make me
a bit lame in one leg during the middle of the week.
You know, something beggable, but not leprosy,
which is a pain in the ass, to be blunt. Excuse my French, sir.
Brian. Come and clean your room out.
-There you are. -Thank you, sir. Thank...
Half a denarii for me bloody life story?
There's no pleasing some people.
That's just what Jesus said, sir.
-Oh! -Good afternoon.
Oh, uh, hello, officer.
Uh... I'll be with you in a few moments, all right, dear?
What's he doing here?
Don't start that, Brian. Go clean your room out.
Bloody Romans.
Now, look, Brian, if it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have all this. And don't you forget it.
we wouldn't have all this. And don't you forget it.
We don't owe the Romans anything, Mum.
Well, that's not entirely true, is it, Brian?
What do you mean?
Well, you know when you were asking me about your, uh--
-My nose? -Yes.
Well, there's a reason it's like it is, Brian.
What is it?
-Well, I suppose I should have told you a long time ago, but... -What?
Well, Brian...
your father isn't Mr. Cohen.
-I never thought he was. -Now, none of your cheek!
He was a Roman, Brian.
He was a centurion in the Roman army.
You mean you were raped?!
Well, at first, yes.
Who was it?
Naughtius Maximus his name was. Hmm.
Promised me the known world, he did.
I was to be taken to Rome, house by the Forum,
slaves, asses' milk, as much gold as I could eat.
Then he, having his way with me he had,
boom, like a rat out of an aqueduct.
The bastard!
The bastard! Yes, and next time you go on about the "bloody Romans"
don't forget you're one of them.
I'm not a Roman, Mum.
And I never will be.
I'm a kike, a yid, a hebe, a hooknose.
I'm kosher, Mum.
I'm a Red Sea pedestrian and proud of it!
Sex, sex, sex, that's all they think about, huh?
Well, how are you then, officer?
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
the next contest is between
Frank Goliath, the Macedonian baby-crusher,
and Boris Mineburg.
[Brian] Thank you, madam.
Larks' tongues.
Wrens' livers.
Chaffinch brains.
Jaguars' earlobes.
Wolf-nipple chips. Get them while they're hot. They're lovely.
Dromedary pretzels, only half a dinar.
Tuscany fried bats...
I do feel, Reg, that any anti-imperialist group like ours
must reflect such a divergence of interest within its power base.
Agreed. Francis?
Yeah, I think Judith's point of view is very valid, Reg,
provided the movement never forgets
that it is the unalienable right of every man...
-Or woman. -...or woman, to rid himself...
-Or herself. -...or herself--
-Agreed. -Thank you, brother.
-Or sister. -Or sister...
Where was I?
I think you finished.
Oh, right.
Furthermore, it is the birthright of every man...
Or woman.
Or woman. Why don't you shut up about women, Stan, you're putting us off.
Women have a perfect right to play a part in our movement, Reg.
Why are you always on about women, Stan?
I want to be one.
What?
I want to be a woman.
From now on, I want you all to call me "Loretta".
What?!
It's my right as a man.
Well, why do you want to be Loretta, Stan?
I want to have babies.
You want to have babies?!
It's every man's right to have babies if he wants them.
But you can't have babies!
Don't you oppress me.
I'm not oppressing you, Stan. You haven't got a womb.
Where's the fetus gonna gestate? You gonna keep it in a box?
Here, I've got an idea.
Suppose you agree that he can't actually have babies,
not having a womb, which is nobody's fault, not even the Romans',
but that he can have the right to have babies.
Good idea, Judith.
We shall fight the oppressors for your right to have babies, brother--
-Sister. Sorry. -What's the point?
-What? -What's the point of fighting
for his right to have babies when he can't have babies?
It is symbolic of our struggle against oppression.
Symbolic of his struggle against reality.
-[man] Get out there. Get out. -[man #2] It's dangerous out there.
Larks' tongues.
Otters' noses.
Ocelots' spleens.
-Got any nuts? -Haven't got any nuts, sorry.
I've got wrens' livers, badgers' spleens--
No, no, no.
-Otters' noses? -I don't want any of that Roman rubbish.
-Why don't you sell proper food? -Proper food?
Yeah, not those rich imperialist tidbits.
Well, don't blame me. I didn't ask to sell this stuff.
All right, bag of otters' noses, then.
-Make it two. -Two.
Thanks, Reg.
Are you the Judean People's Front?
-Fuck off! -What?
[scoffs] Judean People's Front.
We're The People's Front of Judea.
-Judean People's Front, God! -Wankers.
Can I join your group?
No, piss off.
I didn't want to sell this stuff. It's only a job.
I hate the Romans as much as anybody.
Are you sure?
Oh, dead sure. I hate the Romans already.
Listen, if you wanted to join the PFJ,
you'd have to really hate the Romans.
I do.
Oh, yeah, how much?
A lot.
Right, you're in.
Listen, the only people we hate more than the Romans
are the fuckin' Judean People's Front.
-Yeah! -Splitters.
And the Judean Popular People's Front.
-Oh, yeah. -Splitters.
And the People's Front of Judea.
-[Francis and Judith] Splitters. -What?
The People's Front of Judea. Splitters.
We're the People's Front of Judea!
Oh... I thought we were the Popular Front. People's Front!
Whatever happened to the Popular Front, Reg?
He's over there.
[all] Splitter!
I think I'm about to have a cardiac arrest.
-Absolutely dreadful. -Humph!
Yes, brother!
What's your name?
Brian. Brian Cohen.
We may have a little job for you, Brian.
What's this then? "Romanes eunt domus"?
"People called Romanes, they go the house"?
It says, "Romans go home."
-No, it doesn't. -[whimpers] What's Latin for "Roman"?
-Come on. -[shrieks] Romanus?
-Goes like? -Anus?
Vocative plural of anus is?
[whimpering] Ani?
Romani.
"Eunt"? What is eunt?
Go.
Conjugate the verb "to go".
Ere, eo, is, it, imus, itis, eunt.
-So eunt is? -[whimpering]
Third person plural, present indicative. "They go."
But "Romans go home" is an order, so you must use the...?
-Imperative! -Which is?
-I. -How many Romans?
-Plural, plural. Ite. Ite. -Ite.
Domus? Nominative?
"Go home." This is motion towards, isn't it, boy?
Dative! Ahh!
Not dative, not the dative, sir!
The accusative! Accusative!
Domum, sir. Ad domum.
Except that domus takes the...?
-The locative, sir. -Which is?!
-Domum! -Domum.
-[panting] -Um.
-Understand? -Yes, sir.
-Now, write that 100 times. -Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
-Hail Caesar, sir. -Hail Cesar.
If it's not done by sunrise, I'll cut your balls off.
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Hail Caesar and everything, sir.
Finished.
Right.
Now, don't do it again.
Hey! Bloody Romans.
[Francis] We get in through the underground heating-system here,
up through into the main audience chamber here
and Pilate's wife's bedroom is here.
Having grabbed his wife, we inform Pilate that she is in our custody,
and forthwith issue our demands.
-Any questions? -What exactly are the demands?
We're giving Pilate two days to dismantle
the entire apparatus of the Roman imperialist state
and if he doesn't agree immediately, we execute her.
Cut her head off?
Cut all her bits off.
Send them back on the hour, every hour. Show them we're not to be trifled with.
And, of course, we point out
that they bear full responsibility when we chop her up
and that we shall not submit to blackmail.
[all] No blackmail!
They've bled us white, the bastards.
They've taken everything we had. And not just from us!
From our fathers, and from our fathers' fathers.
And from our fathers' fathers' fathers. -Yeah. -And from our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers.
-Yeah. -And from our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers.
Yeah, all right, Stan, don't labor the point.
And what have they ever given us in return?
The aqueduct?
-What? -The aqueduct.
Oh, yeah, yeah, they did give us that. That's true, yeah.
And the sanitation.
Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg. Remember what the city used to be like.
Yeah, all right, I'll grant you the aqueduct and sanitation
are two things the Romans have done.
And the roads.
Well, yeah, obviously the roads.
I mean, the roads go without saying, don't they?
But apart from the sanitation, the aqueduct and the roads--
-[man] Irrigation. -Medicine.
Education.
Yeah, yeah, all right, fair enough. And the wine.
Yeah! Yeah, that's something we'd really miss, Reg, if the Romans left.
[man #2] Public baths.
And it's safe to walk in the streets at night now, Reg.
Yeah, they certainly know how to keep order.
Let's face it, they're the only ones who could in a place like this.
All right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine,
education, wine, public order,
irrigation, roads, the fresh-water system and public health,
what have the Romans ever done for us?
Brought peace?
Oh, peace!
Shut up!
I'm a poor man. My sight is poor.
My legs are old and bent.
It's all right, Matthias.
It's all clear.
Well, where's Reg?
Oh, Reg.
Reg, it's Judith.
What went wrong?
The first blow has been struck.
-Did he finish the slogan? -A hundred times.
In letters ten-foot high, all the way around the palace.
Oh, great.
Great!
We... we need doers in our movement, Brian, but before you join us, know this,
there is not one of us here who would not gladly suffer death
to rid this country of the Romans once and for all.
[man] Uh, well, one.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one.
But otherwise, we're solid. Are you with us?
Yes.
From now on, you shall be called, "Brian, that is called Brian."
Tell him about the raid on Pilate's palace, Francis.
Right. This is the plan...
[Francis] Now, this is the palace in Caesar's Square.
Our commando unit will approach from Fish Street under cover of night,
and make our way to the northwestern main drain.
If questioned, we are sewage workers on our way to a conference.
Reg, our glorious leader and founder of the PFJ,
will be coordinating consultant at the drain head,
though he himself will not be taking part in any terrorist action,
as he has a bad back.
-Aren't you gonna come with us? -Solidarity, brother.
Oh, yes. Solidarity, Reg.
[Francis] Once in the sewer, timing will be of the essence.
There is a Roman feast later in the evening so we must move fast,
and don't wear your best sandals.
Turning left here,
we enter the Caesar Augustus Memorial Sewer.
And from there, proceed directly to the hypocaust.
This has just been re-tiled, so, terrorists, careful with those weapons.
We will now be directly beneath Pilate's audience chamber itself.
This is the moment for Habakkuk to get out his prong.
Campaign for Free Galilee.
Oh, uh, People's Front of Judea. -Officials. -Oh.
What's your group doing here?
We're gonna kidnap Pilate's wife. Take her back. Issue demands.
-So are we. -What?
That's our plan.
-We were here first. -What do you mean?
-We thought of it first. -Oh, yeah?
Yes, a couple of years ago.
-[man] We did? -Okay, come on.
You got all your demands worked out?
-Of course we have. -What are they?
-Well, I'm not telling you. -Pull the other one.
That's not the point. We thought of it before you.
-Did not. -We did.
-You didn't. -We bloody did!
You bastards, we've been planning this for months.
Well, tough titty for you, fish-face.
-All right. -Why you sly...
Brothers! Brothers! We should be struggling together!
We are.
We mustn't fight each other!
Surely, we should be united against the common enemy!
[all] The Judean People's Front?!
No, no, the Romans!
-[all] Oh, yeah. -Yes.
-[Francis] Yeah, he's right. -[man #1] Look out!
[man #2] Careful.
-Right! Where were we? -You were gonna punch me.
Oh, yeah!
-Brothers! -Get off!
-[man] You lucky bastard. -Who's that?
-You lucky, lucky bastard. -What?
Proper little jailer's pet, aren't we?
What do you mean?
You must have slipped him a few shekels, eh?
Slipped him a few shekels? You saw him spit in my face!
Oh! What wouldn't I give to be spat at in the face?
I sometimes hang awake at night, dreaming of being spat at in the face.
Well, it's not exactly friendly. They had me in manacles!
Manacles!
My idea of heaven is to be allowed to be put in manacles just for a few hours.
They must think the sun shines out of your ass, sonny.
Oh, lay off me, I've had a hard time!
You've had a hard time?
I've been here five years, they only hung me the right way up yesterday!
So don't you come around--
All right, all right.
They must think you're Lord God almighty.
What will they do to me?
Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion.
-Crucifixion?! -Yeah. First offence.
Get away with crucifixion?! It's--
Best thing the Romans ever did for us.
-What?! -Oh, yeah.
If we didn't have crucifixion,
this country would be in a right bloody mess.
-Guard! -Nail them up, I say!
-Guard! -Nail some sense into them!
What do you want?
I want you to move me to another cell.
Oh, look at that! Bloody favoritism!
-Shut up, you. -Sorry.
-[coughing] -Now, take my case. They hung me up here five years ago.
Every night they take me down for 20 minutes then they hang me up again.
Which I regard as very fair in view of what I've done.
And if nothing else, it's taught me to respect the Romans
and it's taught me that you'll never get anywhere in this life
unless you are prepared to do a fair day's work -for a fair day's-- -Oh, shut up!
-for a fair day's-- -Oh, shut up!
-Pilate wants to see you! -Me?
Come on!
[Brian] Pilate? What does he want to see me for?
I think he wants to know which way you want to be crucified.
Nice one, centurion. Like it, like it.
-Shut up! -Right. Right.
Terrific race, the Romans.
Terrific.
Looks like a nice living area.
-Hail Caesar. -Hail.
Only one survivor, sir.
Ah. Throw him to the floor.
-What, sir? -Throw him to the floor.
Now, what is your name, Jew?
-Brian, sir. -[speech impediment] Brian, eh?
No, no, Brian.
The little rascal has spirit.
-Has what, sir? -Spirit.
Yes, he did, sir.
No, no, spirit.
Bravado, a touch of derring-do.
Oh, uh, about 11, sir.
So...
-You dare to raid us? -To what, sir?
Strike him, centurion, very roughly.
-Ahh! -Oh, and, uh... throw him to the floor, sir?
-What? -Throw him to the floor again, sir?
Oh, yes. Throw him to the floor, please.
Ahh! Now, Jewish rapscallion...
I'm not Jewish, I'm a Roman.
-A Roman? -No, no, Roman.
Ahh! So... your father was a Roman?
Who was he?
He was a centurion in the Jerusalem garrison, sir.
Really?
-What was his name? -Naughtius Maximus.
Centurion, do you have anyone of that name in the garrison?
Well, no, sir.
Well, you sound very sure. Have you checked?
Well, no, sir, um...
I think it's a joke, sir.
Like "Sillius Soddus" or "Biggus Dickus," sir.
What's so funny about Biggus Dickus?
Well, it's a joke name, sir.
I have a very great friend in Rome called Biggus Dickus.
Silence! What is all this insolence?
You will find yourself in gladiator school very quickly
with rotten behavior like that.
Can I go now, sir?
Wait till Biggus Dickus hears of this.
-[stifles laugh] -Right!
-Take him away! -Oh, sir, he--
No, no, I want him fighting rabid wild animals within a week!
Yes, sir. Come on, you.
I will not have my friends ridiculed by the common soldiery!
Anybody else feel like a little...
giggle
when I mention my friend,
Biggus
-Dickus? -[soldiers snicker]
And what about you?
Do you find it... risible
when I say the name
-Biggus -[squeaks]
Dickus?
He has a wife, you know.
You know what she's called?
She's called...
Incontinentia.
-Incontinentia Buttocks. -[uncontrollable laughter]
Shut up! What is all this?
-[soldiers cackling] -I've had enough of this rowdy, rebel, sniggering behavior!
Silence! You call yourselves centurion guards?
Seize him! Seize him!
Seize him! Seize him! Blow your noses and seize him!
You lucky bastard.
And the beast's head shall be huge and black
and the eyes, they're of red, with the blood of living creatures!
And the whore of Babylon shall ride forth on a three-headed serpent
and throughout the land shall be a great rubbing of parts.
And the demon shall bear a nine-bladed sword!
Nine-bladed! Not two or five or seven, but nine!
Which he will wield on all wretched sinners.
Sinners just like you, sir, there.
And the horns shall be on the head...
Through Hebediah, his servant,
there shall in that time be rumors of things going astray
and there shall be a great confusion as to where things really are.
And nobody will really know where lieth those little things
with the sort of raffia-work base, that has an attachment.
At this time, a friend shall lose his friend's hammer
and the young shall not know where lieth
the things possessed by their fathers
that their fathers put there only just the night before, about 8:00.
Yea, it is written in the Book of Cyril that in that time shall the turds...
-How much? Quickly. -What?
It's for the wife.
Oh. Uh... twenty shekels.
-Right. -What?
-There you are. -Wait a minute.
-What? -Well, we're supposed to haggle.
-No, no, no. I've got to-- -What do you mean, "No, no, no"?
-I haven't got time-- -Give it back then.
-No, no, no, I just paid you. -Burt.
-Yeah? -This bloke won't haggle.
-Won't haggle?! -All right, do we have to?
-Now, look, I want 20 for that. -I just gave you 20.
Now, are you telling me that's not worth 20 shekels?
-No. -Look at it.
Feel the quality, that's none of your goat.
All right, I'll give you 19 then.
No, no, no. Come on, do it properly.
-What? -Haggle properly, this isn't worth 19.
Well, you just said it was worth 20.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
-Come on, haggle. -All right, I'll give you ten.
That's more like it. Ten? Are you trying to insult me?
Me, with a poor, dying grandmother? Ten?
-All right, I'll give you 11. -Now you're getting it, 11?!
Did I hear you right? Eleven?
This cost me 12, you want to ruin me?
-Seventeen? -No, no, no, no, "17"!
-Eighteen? -No, no, you go to 14 now.
-All right, I'll give you 14. -Fourteen!? Are you joking?
-That's what you told me to say! -Oh, dear.
Tell me what to say, please!
-Offer me 14. -I'll give you 14.
-He's offering me 14 for this! -Fifteen!
Seventeen. My last word, I won't take a penny less, or strike me dead.
-Sixteen. -Done.
Nice to do business with you.
Tell you what, I'll throw you in this as well.
-I don't want it, but thanks. -Burt.
-Yeah. -All right, all right, all right.
-Now, where's the 16 you owe me? -I just gave you 20.
Oh, yeah, that's right. That's four I owe you then.
No, that's all right, that's fine.
No, hang on. I've got it here somewhere.
It's all right, that's four for the gourd.
Four? For this gourd?
Four!? Look at it, it's worth ten if it's worth a shekel!
You just gave it to me for nothing.
Yes, but it's worth ten.
All right, all right.
No, no, no, no, it's not worth ten, you're supposed to argue.
"Ten for that? You must be mad!"
Oh, well. One born every minute.
-Daniel. -Daniel.
-Job. -Job.
-Job. -Joshua.
-Joshua. -Joshua.
-Judges. -Judges.
-Judges. -And Brian.
-And Brian. -And Brian.
I now propose that all seven of these ex-brothers
be now entered in the minutes as probationary martyrs to the cause.
-I second that, Reg. -Thank you, Loretta. On the nod.
Siblings, let us not be down-hearted.
One total catastrophe like this is just the beginning!
Their glorious deaths shall unite us all in a--
Look out!
Hello? Matthias?
-Reg. -[Reg whispers] Go away.
Reg, it's me, Brian.
Get off. Get off, out of it.
-Stan? -Piss off.
-Yeah, piss off. -[Reg] Bugger off.
Oh, shit!
Coming.
[man] Yea, verily at that time, which is written in the Book of Obadiah,
a man shall strike his donkey and his nephew's donkey,
and anyone in the vicinity of either the nephew or the donkey.
[Matthias] My eyes are dim, I cannot see.
-Are you Matthias? -Yes.
We have reason to believe you may be hiding one Brian of Nazareth,
a member of the terrorist organization the People's Front of Judea.
Me? No, I'm just a poor old man, I have no time for lawbreakers.
My legs are grey, my ears are nulled, -my eyes are old and bent-- -Quiet!
-my eyes are old and bent-- -Quiet!
Silly person. Guards, search the house.
You know the penalty laid down by Roman law for harboring a known criminal?
-No. -Crucifixion.
Nasty, eh?
It could be worse.
What do you mean, "could be worse"?
Well, you could be stabbed.
Stabbed? It takes a second.
Crucifixion lasts hours. It's a slow, horrible death.
Well, at least it gets you out in the open air.
You're weird.
No, sir, couldn't find anything, sir.
Well, don't worry, you've not seen the last of us... weirdo.
-Big nose. -Watch it!
Whew! That was lucky.
I'm sorry, Reg.
Oh, it's all right. Siblings, he's sorry.
He's sorry he led the Fifth legion straight to our official headquarters.
Well, that's all right then, Brian.
Sit down! Have a scone. Make yourself at home.
You klutz!
You stupid, birdbrained, flat-headed--
[man continues] ...with a great juicy melon behind.
My legs are old and bent, my ears are grizzled, yes?
There's one place we didn't look.
-Guards! -I'm just a poor old man,
my sight is dim, my eyes are poor, my nose is knackered.
Have you ever seen anyone crucified?
Crucifixion's a doddle.
Don't keep saying that.
Found this spoon, sir.
Well done, sergeant.
We'll be back... oddball.
-[loud knocking] -[man] Open up.
You haven't given us time to hide.
Don't pass judgment on other people,
or you might get judged yourself.
What?
I said, don't pass judgment on other people
or else you might get judged too.
-Who, me? -Yes.
Oh, thank you very much.
Well, not just you, all of you.
-That's a nice gourd. -What?
-How much do you want for the gourd? -You can have it.
-Have it? -Yes. Consider the lilies.
-Don't you want to haggle? -No. In the field.
-What's wrong with it, then? -Nothing, take it.
-Consider the lilies? -Well, the birds, then.
-What birds? -Any birds.
-Why? -Well, have they got jobs?
-Who? -The birds.
Have the birds got jobs?!
What's the matter with him?
He says the birds are scrounging.
No, the point is the birds, they do all right, don't they?
-Well, and good luck to them! -Yeah, they're very pretty.
Okay. And you're much more important than they are, right?
So, what are you worrying about? There you are! See?
I'm worrying about what you've got against birds.
I haven't got anything against birds. Consider lilies--
He's having a go at the flowers now.
-Give the flowers a chance. -I'll give you one for it.
-It's yours! -Two then.
[sighs] Look, there was this man, and he had two servants--
-What were they called? -What?
-What were their names? -I don't know.
And he gave them some talents--
-You don't know? -Well, it doesn't matter.
He doesn't know what they were called!
Oh, they were called Simon and Adrian. Now--
You said you didn't know!
It really doesn't matter, the point is there were these two servants--
He's making it up as he goes along!
No, I'm not! And he gave them--
-Wait a minute, were there three? -[all groan]
-He's terrible. -There were three stewards really.
[woman] Oh, get off!
Now--Now, hear this.
Blessed are they who convert their neighbor's ox,
for they shall inhibit their girth.
-[man] Rubbish! -And, to them only,
shall be given...
To them only
shall be given...
-[woman] What? -Hmm?
-[woman] Shall be given what? -Oh, nothing.
-What were you going to say? -[Brian] Nothing.
Yes, you were going to say something.
-No, I wasn't. I finished. -Oh, no, no.
Come on, tell us before you go.
-I wasn't going to say anything. I finished. -[woman] No, you hadn't.
-What won't he tell us? -He won't say.
-Is it a secret? -No.
-Is it? -It must be, otherwise he'd tell us.
-Oh, tell us the secret. -Leave me alone.
-What is the secret? -Is it the secret of eternal life?
-He won't say! -Of course not!
If I knew the secret of eternal life, I wouldn't say.
-Leave me alone. -Just tell me, please.
No, tell us, master, we were here first.
-Five! -Go away!
-Tell us, master. -I can't go above five.
-Is that his gourd? -Yes, but it's under offer.
-This is his gourd. -Ten!
It is his gourd.
We will carry it for you, master.
Master?
He's gone. He's been taken up.
-Oh, he has been taken up! -Eighteen!
No, there he is. Over there.
Look! Look!
-[gasps] -He has given us a sign.
He has given us his shoe!
The shoe is the sign! Let us follow his example!
-What? -Let us, like him,
hold up one shoe and let the other be upon our foot,
for this is his sign that all who follow him shall do likewise!
No, no, the shoe is a sign
that we must gather shoes together in abundance.
Cast off the shoes. Follow the gourd!
No, let us gather shoes together.
-Let me! -Oh, get off!
No, it is a sign that, like him, we must think not of the things of the body,
but of the face and head!
-Give me your shoe! -Get off!
Follow the gourd, the holy gourd of Jerusalem!
The gourd!
Hold up the sandal, like he has--
-It is a shoe! It is a shoe! -It's a sandal!
-No, it isn't! It is a shoe! -[woman] Cast it away!
-Put it on! -Now clear off.
Take the shoes and follow him!
Come all ye who call yourselves Gourdenes.
Stop, I say.
Stop. Let us...
Let us pray.
Yea, he cometh to us
like the seed to the grave...
Master! Master!
Hey, is there another way down?
Is there another path down to the river?
Please, please, help me! I've got to get...
Oh, my foot!
-Damn! Damn! Damn! -I'm sorry.
-Oh, damn! Damn and blast it! -I'm sorry! Shh!
-Oh, damn! Damn and blast it! -I'm sorry! Shh! Don't you "shh" me.
Eighteen years of total silence, and you "shh" me.
-What? -I've kept my vow for 18 years.
Not a single recognizable, articulate sound has passed my lips.
Oh, please, could you be quiet for another five minutes?
Oh, it doesn't matter now, I might as well enjoy myself.
The times in the last 18 years I wanted to shout and sing
-and scream my name out! Oh, I'm alive! -Shh! Shh!
♪ Hava nagila hava nagila Hava nagila-- ♪
Oh, I'm alive! I'm alive!
Hello, birds! Hello, trees! I'm alive!
Get off! I'm alive!
[all] Master! Master!
The master! He is here!
-His shoe! -It was the gourd!
The shoe has brought us!
Speak! Speak to us, master! Speak to us!
Go away!
[all] A blessing! A blessing!
How shall we go away, master?
Just go away and leave me alone.
Give us a sign.
He has given us a sign, he has brought us to this place!
I didn't bring you here, you just followed me!
Oh, it's still a good sign, by any standard.
Master, your people have walked many miles to be with you.
They are weary and have not eaten.
It's not my fault they haven't eaten!
There is no food in this high mountain.
What about the juniper bushes over there?
[all gasp] A miracle! A miracle!
He has made the bush fruitful by his word!
They brought forth juniper berries!
Of course they brought forth juniper berries, they're juniper bushes.
-What do you expect?! -Show us another miracle.
Do not tempt him, shallow ones!
Is not the miracle of the juniper bushes enough?
I say, those are my juniper bushes.
They are a gift from God!
They're all I've bloody got to eat.
[grunts] I say, get off of those bushes! Go on!
Clear off, the lot of you.
Lord, I am affected by a bald patch.
I'm healed! The master has healed me!
I didn't touch him!
I was blind, and now I can see!
[all] A miracle! A miracle! A miracle!
Tell them to stop it.
I hadn't said a word for 18 years till he came along.
[all] A miracle! He is the Messiah!
And he hurt my foot!
[all] Hurt my foot, Lord! Hurt mine! Hurt mine!
-Hail Messiah! -I'm not the Messiah!
I say you are, Lord. And I should know, I've followed a few!
[all] Hail Messiah!
I'm not the Messiah! Would you please listen,
I'm not the Messiah! Would you please listen, I am not the Messiah, do you understand?
Honestly!
Only the true Messiah denies his divinity.
What? Well, what sort of chance does that give me?
All right, I am the Messiah!
[all] He is! He is the Messiah!
Now, fuck off!
How shall we fuck off, o Lord?
Oh, just go away! Leave me alone!
You told these people to eat my juniper berries.
You break my bloody foot, you break my vow of silence
and then you try and clean up on my juniper bushes!
Lay off! This is the Messiah, the chosen one!
-No, he's not. -An unbeliever!
[all] An unbeliever!
Persecute! Kill the heretic!
[all] Yeah! Kill! Kill! Kill!
-[all chanting] Kill! -Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone.
Put him down. Please!
Brian?
Judith?
[all] Look, there he is!
The chosen one has woken!
-[pounding on door] -[mother] Brian!
Ooh! Mother!
-Brian! -Hang on, Mother!
-Hello, Mother. -Don't you "hello, Mother" me.
What are those people doing out there?
Oh, well, I--
Come on! What have you been up to, my lad?
I think they must have popped by for something.
Popped by?!
Swarmed by, more like.
There's a multitude out there!
They started following me yesterday.
Well, they can stop following you right now.
Now stop following my son.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
[all] The Messiah! The Messiah! Show us the Messiah!
-The who? -[all] The Messiah!
There's no Messiah in here.
There's a mess all right, but no Messiah.
Now go away!
[all chant] Brian! Brian!
Right, my lad, what have you been up to?
-Nothing, Mum. -Come on, out with it.
They think I'm the Messiah, Mum.
What have you been telling them?
Nothing, I only--
You're only making it worse for yourself.
Look, I can explain--
No, let me explain, Mrs. Cohen! Your son is a born leader!
Those people out there are following him because they believe in him, Mrs. Cohen.
They believe he can give them hope.
Hope of a new life, a new world, a better future!
-Who's that!? -Oh! That's Judith, Mum.
Judith, Mother.
Hmm. Ahh! -Ooh...! -[crowd chants] Show us the Messiah!
Now you listen here, he's not the Messiah!
He's a very naughty boy! Now go away!
[all] Who are you?
I'm his mother, that's who.
[all] Behold his mother! Behold his mother!
Hail to thee, mother of Brian!
Blessed art thou! Hosanna!
All things to thee, now and always!
Now, don't think you can get around me like that.
He's not coming out, and that's my final word.
Now shove off!
[all] No!
Did you hear what I said?
[all] Yes!
Oh, I see. It's like that, is it?
[all] Yes!
Oh, all right then, you can see him for one minute,
but not one second more, do you understand?
[all] Yes.
Promise?
[all] Well, all right.
All right, here he is then.
Come on, Brian, come and talk to them.
-But, Mum, Judith-- -Leave that Welsh tart alone.
-I don't really want to, Mum. -[crowd cheers]
[Brian] Good morning!
[all] A blessing! A blessing!
No, please. Please, please, listen!
I've got one or two things to say.
[all] Tell us! Tell us both of them!
Look, you've got it all wrong!
You don't need to follow me.
You don't need to follow anybody!
You've got to think for yourselves.
You're all individuals!
[all] Yes, we're all individuals!
You're all different.
[all] Yes, we are all different!
I'm not.
You've all got to work it out for yourselves!
[all] Yes, we've got to work it out for ourselves!
Exactly!
[all] Tell us more!
No, that's the point! Don't let anyone tell you what to do!
-Otherwise-- Oh, no! -That's enough! That's enough.
[all] That wasn't a minute.
Oh, yes, it was.
[all] Oh, no, it wasn't!
Now stop that and go away.
-Excuse me? -Yes?
Are you a virgin?
I beg your pardon?
Well, if it's not a personal question, are you a virgin?
"If it's not a personal question"?!
How much more personal can you get?
Now piss off.
-She is. -Must be. Definitely.
-[all gasp] -Morning, Savior!
Lay your hands on me! Quick!
[man] Now, don't jostle the chosen one! Please!
Don't push that baby in the Savior's face!
He'll touch it later!
I say, could he see my wife? She has a headache.
You'll have to wait, I'm afraid!
She's very bad, and we've got a luncheon appointment.
Look, the lepers are queuing!
Her brother-in-law is the ex-mayor of Gath.
Brian, can I introduce the gentleman who's letting us have the mounts on Sunday?
-[man] Hello. -Don't push!
Now keep the noise down, please!
Those possessed by devils, try and keep them under control a bit, can't you?
Incurables, you'll just have to wait for a few minutes.
Um... women taken in sin, line up against that wall, will you?
[Judith] Brian?
Brian! You were fantastic!
You weren't so bad yourself.
No, what you said just now! Quite extraordinary!
What? Oh, that. Was it?
We don't need any leaders! You're so right!
Reg has been dominating us for too long. Well, yes--
Well, yes-- It needed saying, and you said it, Brian!
You're very attractive.
It's our revolution! We can all do it together!
I think... I think--
We're all behind you, Brian!
The revolution is in your hands!
What? No, that's not what I meant at all!
You're fucking nicked, me old beauty!
-[dramatic music] -Right!
Stop it!
Well, Brian, you've given us a good run for our money.
A what?
And this time,
I guarantee you will not escape.
Guard... do we have any crucifixions today?
A hundred and thirty-nine, sir. Special celebration. Passover, sir.
Right! Now we have 140!
Nice round number, eh, Biggus?
-[crowd clamoring] -Hail Caesar! Hail!
The crowd outside are getting a bit restless, sir.
Permission to disperse them, please.
Disperse them? But I haven't addressed them yet!
Uh, no, I know, sir, but--
My address is one of the high points of Passover!
My friend, Biggus Dickus, has come all the way from Rome just to hear it!
-Hail Caesar! -[lisping] Hail Caesar!
You're not...
You're not thinking of giving it a miss this year, then, sir?
Give it a miss?!
Well, it's just that they're in a rather funny mood today, sir.
Really, centurion! I'm surprised to hear a man like you
Really, centurion! I'm surprised to hear a man like you rattled by a rabble of rowdy rebels.
-A bit thundery, sir. -Take him away!
I'm a Roman! I can prove it, honestly!
And crucify him well!
Biggus!
[stammers] I really wouldn't, sir!
Out of the way, centurion!
Let me come with you, Pontius.
I may be of some assistance if there is a sudden crisis!
Right! Now, item four,
attainment of world supremacy within the next five years.
Uh, Francis, you've been doing some work on this?
Yeah, thank you, Reg.
Well, quite frankly, siblings, I think five years is optimistic unless we can smash the Roman Empire
I think five years is optimistic unless we can smash the Roman Empire within the next 12 months!
-Twelve months? -Yeah, 12 months.
And let's face it, as empires go, this is the big one.
So we gotta get up off our asses and stop just talking about it!
[all] Hear! Hear!
I agree! It's action that counts, not words, and we need action now!
[all] Hear! Hear!
You're right. We could sit around here all day,
talking, passing resolutions, making clever speeches,
it's not gonna shift one Roman soldier!
So let's just stop gabbing on about it!
It's completely pointless and it's getting us nowhere!
[all] Right!
[all] Right! I agree! This is a complete waste of time!
They've arrested Brian!
[all] What?
They've dragged him off! They're gonna crucify him!
Right! This calls for immediate discussion!
-Yes. -What?!
-Immediate! -Right!
-New motion? -Completely new motion!
Uh, that, uh... that there be immediate action...
Uh, once the vote has been taken. Obviously, once the vote's been taken.
Can't act on a resolution until you've voted--
-Reg, let's go now, please! -Right! Right!
In the light of fresh information from sibling Judith...
-Not so fast, Reg. -Reg, for God's sake!
It's perfectly simple!
All you've gotta do is to go out of that door now
and try to stop the Romans nailing him up!
It's happening, Reg!
Something's actually happening, Reg!
Can't you understand?
Yeah, hello.
Another little ego trip from the feminists.
-What? -Oh, sorry, Loretta.
Uh... read that back, would you?
Next.
-Crucifixion? -Yes.
Good. Out of the door, line on the left, one cross each.
Next.
-Crucifixion? -Mm-hmm.
Good. Out of the door, line on the left, one cross each. Next.
-Crucifixion? -Uh, no, freedom.
Hmm? -What? -Uh, freedom for me.
They said I hadn't done anything so I could go free
and live on an island somewhere.
Oh. Oh, well, that's jolly good. Well, off you go, then.
No, I'm only pulling your leg. It's crucifixion, really.
Oh. I see. Very good, very good.
Well, out of the door.
Yeah, I know the way. Out of the door, one cross each, line on the left.
Line on the left. Yes, thank you.
Crucifixion?
-Yes. -Good.
[speech impediment] People of Jerusalem!
Rome is your friend!
To prove our friendship, it is customary at this time
To prove our friendship, it is customary at this time to release a wrongdoer from our prisons. -[crowd laughs] -[guard snickers]
Whom would you have me release?
-[imitates speech impediment] Release Roger! -[all cheer]
[all] Release Roger! Release Roger!
Very well, I shall release Roger!
Sir, we don't have a Roger, sir.
-What? -We don't have anyone of that name, sir.
Ah. We have no Roger!
-Well, what about Roderick, then? -Yeah!
[all] Release Roderick! Release Roderick!
Centurion, why do they titter so?
Just some, uh, Jewish joke, sir.
Are they... ragging me?
Oh, no, sir!
Very well. I shall release Roderick!
Sir, we don't have a Roderick either.
-No Roger, no Roderick? -Sorry, sir.
-Who is this--? -[guard snickers]
Who is this Roderick to whom you refer?
He is a robber!
And a rapist!
And a pickpocket! -[man] Yeah! -[all shushing]
He sounds a notorious criminal.
We haven't got him, sir.
Do we have anyone in our prisons at all?
Oh, yes, sir. We've got a Samson, sir.
-Samson? -Samson, the Sadducee Strangler, sir.
Uh, Silas, the Syrian Assassin.
Uh, several seditious scribes from Caesarea.
Uh... sixty-seven--
[lisping] Let me speak to them, Pontius!
-Oh, no! -Ah, good idea, Biggus.
Citizens! We have Samson the Sadducee Strangler,
-Silas the Assyrian Assassin... -[crowd laughing]
...several seditious scribes from Caesarea and...
Next.
Crucifixion?
-Yes. -Good.
Out of the door, line on the left, one cross each.
-Jailor-- -Excuse me?
There's been some sort of a mistake. Just a moment, would you? Jailor?
-How many have come through? -What?
Uh, how many have come through?
What?
You'll have to speak...
Speak up a bit, sir. He's d...
-[stammers] -Oh. He's deaf as a post, sir.
Um... How many have come through?
-Oh, dear. -I make it 90...
Ninety-six, sir.
It's such a senseless waste of human life, isn't it?
No, sir!
Not with these... bastards, sir!
Crucifixion's too good for them, sir.
I don't think you could say it's good for them, it's very nasty!
Oh, it's not as n...
Not as nasty as something I just thought up, sir.
Now, um, crucifixion?
Is there someone I could speak to?
-Well-- -I know where to get it if you want it.
-What? -Don't worry about him, sir. He's... [stammers]
He's deaf and mad, sir.
Well, how did he get the job?
Bloody Pilate's pet, sir!
Get a move on, big nose!
There's people waiting to be crucified out here! [laughs]
Could I see a lawyer or someone?
Um, do you have a lawyer?
No, but I'm a Roman.
How about a retrial? We've got plenty of time.
-Shut up, you! -Miserable, bloody Romans!
No sense of humor. [grunts]
I'm sorry, bit of a hurry.
Can you go straight out, line on the left, one cross each.
Now...
Was it something I said?
Silence!
[speech impediment] This man commands a crack legion!
He ranks as high as any in Rome!
Crucifixion party?
Morning.
Now, we will be on show as we go through the town,
so let's not let the side down!
Keep in a good, straight line, three lengths between you and the man in front
and a good, steady pace.
Crosses over your left shoulders,
and if you keep your backs hard up
against the crossbeam you'll be there in no time.
All right, centurion!
Crucifixion party!
Wait for it.
Crucifixion party!
By the left! Forward!
[man] You lucky bastards!
You lucky, jammy bastards!
Let me shoulder your burden, brother!
Thank you.
-Hey! Hey! -What do you think you're doing?
Uh, it's not my cross--
Shut up and get on with it! Come on!
He had you there, mate, didn't he?
That'll teach you a lesson!
All right!
I will give you one more chance!
This time I want to hear no Rubens,
no Reginalds,
no Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeers.
No Spencer Tracys!
Or we shall release no one!
-Release Brian! -Oh, yeah, that's a good one!
[all] Release Brian! Release Brian!
Very well! That's it!
-Sir, we have got a Brian, sir. -What?
You just sent him for crucifixion, sir!
Wait! Wait! We do have a Brian.
Well, go and free him, straight away! Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Very well.
I shall release Brian!
Get a move on, there!
-Or what? -Or you'll be in trouble!
Oh, dear. You mean I might have to give up being crucified in the afternoons?
-Shut up! -That would be a blow, wouldn't it?
I wouldn't have nothing to do!
Oh, thank you!
Have they gone?
We've got lumps of it around the back.
What?
Oh, don't worry about him sir, he's ma...
He's... He's mad, sir.
Have they gone?!
-Oh, come on. -Yes, sir.
Anyway, get on with the story.
Well, I just never really liked them, so I just--
Right! The motion to get on with it passed with one abstention.
I propose we go without further ado. May I have a second?
-Let's just go. -Yeah, all right.
-Bloody Romans! -Watch it!
Still a few crosses left!
Up you go, big nose!
I'll get you for this, you bastard!
-Oh, yeah! -Oh, yeah. Don't worry.
-I never forget a face. -No?
I warn you. I'm gonna punch you so hard, you Roman git!
Shut up, you Jewish turd!
Who are you calling Jewish?
I'm not Jewish, I'm a Samaritan!
A Samaritan? This is supposed to be a Jewish section!
It doesn't matter! You're all gonna die in a day or two!
It may not matter to you, Roman, but it certainly matters to us, doesn't it, darling?
Oh, rather!
Under the terms of the Roman occupancy,
we're entitled to be crucified in a purely Jewish area.
Pharisees separate from Sadducees!
-And Swedish separate from Welsh! -[all grumbling]
All right, all right, all right! We'll soon settle this!
Hands up, all those who don't want to be crucified here!
Right! Next!
Uh, look, it's not my cross.
-What? -Um, it's not my cross.
I was holding it for someone.
Just lie down, I haven't got all day!
No, of course. Look, I hate to make a fuss--
Look, we've had a busy day, there's 140 of you lot to get up.
-Is he Jewish? -Will you be quiet?!
We don't want any more Samaritans around here.
Belt up!
Will you let me down if he comes back?
Yeah, yeah, we'll let you down. Next!
You don't have to do this! You don't have to take orders!
I like orders.
See? Not so bad once you're up.
You're being rescued then, are you?
It's a bit late for that now, isn't it?
Oh, no, we've got a couple of days up here.
Plenty of time. Lots of people get rescued.
Oh? Oh, yeah. My brother usually rescues me.
If he can keep off the tail for more than 20 minutes. -[scoffs] -Oh.
Randy little bugger. Up and down like the Assyrian Empire. [laughs]
Hello. Your family arrived then?
Reg!
Hello, sibling Brian.
Thank God you've come, Reg.
Um, yes, I think I should point out first, Brian, in all fairness,
that we are not, in fact, the rescue committee.
However, I have been asked to read the following prepared statement
on behalf of the movement.
"We, the People's Front of Judea,
brackets, officials, end brackets,
do hereby convey our sincere fraternal and sisterly greetings to you, Brian,
on this, the occasion of your martyrdom."
-What? -"Your death will stand as a landmark
in the continuing struggle to liberate the parent land
from the hands of the Roman imperialist aggressors,
excluding those concerned with drainage, medicine,
roads, housing, education, viniculture
and any other Romans contributing to the welfare of Jews
of both sexes and hermaphrodites.
Signed, On behalf of the PFJ," et cetera.
And I'd just like to add, on a personal note,
my own admiration for what you're doing for us, Brian,
and what must be, after all, for you, a very difficult time.
Reg! What are you going to do?
Goodbye, Brian. And thanks.
All right, Brian. Keep it up, lad.
Terrific work, Brian.

Cheer up, you old bugger!
Come on! Give us a grin! There you are!
See? The end of the film.
Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer.
Some of us have got to live as well, you know?
[man] Who do you think pays for all this rubbish?
They're not gonna make their money back, you know.
I told them. I said to him. "Bernie," I said,
Halt!
Who goes there?
It is I, Arthur, Son of Uther Pendragon,
from the Castle of Camelot,
king of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons,
sovereign of all England.
Pull the other one.
I am, and this is my trusty servant, Patsy.
We have ridden the length and breadth of the land
in search of knights
who will join me in my court at Camelot.
I must speak with your lord and master.
-What? Ridden on a horse? -Yes.
-You're using coconuts! -What?
You've got two empty halves of coconut, and you're banging them together.
So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land.
Through the Kingdom of Mercia.
Where did you get the coconuts?
We found them.
Found them? In Mercia? The coconut is tropical.
What do you mean? Well, this is a temperate zone.
The swallow may fly south with the sun,
or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter,
yet these are not strangers to our land.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Not at all. They could be carried.
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
It could grip it by the husk.
It's not a question of where he grips it.
It's a simple question of weight ratios.
A five-ounce bird could not carry a one-pound coconut.
It doesn't matter.
Will you go and tell your master
that Arthur from the court of Camelot is here?
Listen, in order to maintain air-speed velocity,
a swallow needs to beat its wings
43 times every second, right?
-Please! -Am I right?
I'm not interested.
It could be carried by an African swallow.
Oh, yes! An African swallow, maybe.
Not a European swallow. That's my point.
Oh, yeah. I agree with that.
Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?
But then, of course, African swallows are non-migratory.
Oh, yes.
So, they couldn't bring a coconut back, anyway.
Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows carried it together?
No, they'd have to have it on a line.
Simple. They'd just use a strand of creeper.
What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
Well, why not? -[people sobbing] -[bell dings]
Bring out your dead!
Bring out your dead!

Nine pence.
Bring out your dead!

-Bring out your dead! -[cat snarls]
-Bring out your dead! -Here's one.
-Bring out your dead! -Here's one. Nine pence.
-I'm not dead! -What?
Nothing. Here's your nine pence.
I'm not dead!
-Here. He says he's not dead. -Yes, he is.
-I'm not! -He isn't?
He will be soon. He's very ill.
I'm getting better!
No, you're not. You'll be stone dead in a moment.
I can't take him like that. It's against regulations.
I don't want to go on the cart.
Don't be such a baby.
-I can't take him. -I feel fine.
-Well, do us a favor. -I can't.
Can you hang around a couple of minutes? He won't be long.
Got to go to the Robinsons'. They've lost nine today.
-When's your next round? -Thursday.
I think I'll go for a walk.
You're not fooling anyone, you know.
Look, isn't there something you can do?
I feel happy! I feel happy!
-[man grunts] -Thanks very much. Not at all. See you on Thursday.
Right.
-Who's that, then? -I don't know. Must be a king.
Why?
He hasn't got shit all over him.
-Old woman! -Man!
Man, sorry. What knight lives in that castle over there?
-I'm 37. -What?
-I'm 37. I'm not old. -I can't just call you "man."
You could say "Dennis."
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you?
I did say sorry about the "old woman," but from behind--
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior.
-Well, I am king. -King? Very nice.
How did you get that? By exploiting the workers!
By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma
which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society!
If there's ever going to be any progress--
Dennis, there's some lovely filth down here. Ooh.
How do you do?
How do you do, good lady? I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
-Whose castle is that? -King of the who?
-The Britons. -Who are the Britons?
We all are. We're all Britons. And I am your king.
Didn't know we had a king. I thought we were an autonomous collective.
You're fooling yourself. We're living in a dictatorship.
A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working class--
There you go! Bringing class into it again.
That's what it's all about. If only people--
Please! Please, good people. I am in haste.
Who lives in that castle?
-No one lives there. -Then who is your lord?
-We don't have a lord. -What?
I told you. We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.
We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
Yes.
Yes. But all the decisions of that officer
have to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting.
Yes, I see.
Yes, I see. By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
Be quiet! By a two-thirds majority in the case of--
Be quiet! I order you to be quiet.
"Order"? Who does he think he is?
-I am your king! -Well, I didn't vote for you.
-You don't vote for kings. -How did you become king then?
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,
held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water,
signifying, by divine providence,
that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.
That is why I'm your king!
Listen. Strange women lying in ponds
distributing swords, is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power
for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses.
Not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
Be quiet!
Be quiet! You can't expect to wield supreme executive power
just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you.
Shut up!
Shut up! I mean, if I went around saying I was an emperor
because some moistened bint
had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!
Shut up! Will you shut up?
Now we see the violence inherent in the system.
Shut up!
Come and see the violence inherent in the system!
-Help, I'm being repressed! -Bloody peasant!
What a giveaway. Did you hear that?
That's what I'm on about. Did you see him repressing me?
You saw it didn't you?
You fight with the strength of many men, Sir Knight.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
I seek the finest and the bravest knights in the land to join me in my court at Camelot.
in the land to join me in my court at Camelot.
You have proved yourself worthy. Will you join me?
You make me sad. So be it. Come, Patsy.
None shall pass.
-What? -None shall pass.
I have no quarrel with you, good Sir Knight,
but I must cross this bridge.
Then you shall die.
I command you, as King of the Britons, to stand aside.
I move for no man.
So be it!
Now, stand aside, worthy adversary.
-'Tis but a scratch. -"A scratch"? Your arm's off.
-No, it isn't. -Well, what's that, then?
-I've had worse. -You liar.
Come on, you pansy!
Victory is mine.
We thank thee, Lord, that in thy--
-Come on, then. -What?
Have at you.
You are indeed brave, Sir Knight,
-but the fight is mine. -Oh, had enough, eh?
Look, you stupid bastard! You've got no arms left.
-Yes, I have. -Look!
Just a flesh wound.
-Look, stop that. -Chicken! Chicken!
I'll have your leg. Right!
-Right! I'll do you for that. -You'll what?
-Right! I'll do you for that. -You'll what? Come here.
What are you going to do? Bleed on me?
-I am invincible! -You're a loony.
The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
Come on, then.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
-Come, Patsy. -Oh, I see.
Running away, eh? You yellow bastards!
Come back here and take what's coming to you!
I'll bite your legs off!
-A witch! -We found a witch!
-We got a witch! -We found a witch!
We've got a witch!
Burn her! Burn her!
We have found a witch. May we burn her?
Burn her! Burn her!
How do you know she is a witch?
She looks like one.
Bring her forward.
-I am not a witch. -But you are dressed as one.
-They dressed me up like this. -We didn't!
And this isn't my nose. It's a false one.
-Well? -Well, we did do the nose.
The nose?
And the hat. But she is a witch.
Burn her! Burn her!
Did you dress her up like this?
-No! No! -No!
-Yes. Yes. -Yes.
-A bit. She has got a wart. -A bit.
What makes you think she is a witch?
Well, she turned me into a newt.
A newt?
I got better.
-Burn her anyway. -Burn her!
Quiet! There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
Are there? What are they? Tell us.
Do they hurt?
Tell me, what do you do with witches?
Burn them! Burn them!
And what do you burn apart from witches?
More witches!
-Wood. -So, why do witches burn?
-'Cause they're made of wood? -Good.
So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?
Build a bridge out of her.
Ah, but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
Oh, yeah.
Does wood sink in water?
-No. -It floats! It floats!
Throw her into the pond!
-What also floats in water? -Bread.
-Apples. -Very small rocks.
-Cider. Cherries. -Gravy. Mud.
-Churches. -Lead.
A duck!
Exactly.
So, logically...
If she...
weighs the same as a duck...
she's made of wood.
And, therefore...
-A witch! -A witch!
We shall use my largest scales.
Right. Remove the supports!
-A witch! -A witch!
-It's a fair cop. -Burn her!
Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of science?
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
My liege.
Good Sir Knight, will you come with me to Camelot,
and join us at the Round Table?
My liege, I would be honored.
-What is your name? -Bedevere, my liege.
Then I dub you Sir Bedevere,
knight of the Round Table.
[narrator] The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join
[narrator] The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights.
But other illustrious names were soon to follow.
Sir Lancelot the Brave.
Sir Galahad the Pure.
And Sir Robin, the Not-quite- so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot,
who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor,
who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol,
and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill.
And the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.
Together they formed a band
whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries.
The Knights of the Round Table.
That, my liege, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.
Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
-Certainly, sir. -Look, my liege!
-Camelot. -Camelot.
-Camelot. -It's only a model.

[voice] Arthur. Arthur.
King of the Britons.
Oh, don't grovel. If there's one thing I can't stand,
it's people groveling.
-Sorry. -And don't apologize!
Every time I try to talk to someone it's "sorry this,"
and, "forgive me that," and, "I'm not worthy."
-What are you doing now? -I'm averting my eyes, Oh Lord.
Don't. It's like those miserable psalms. They're so depressing.
-Now, knock it off! -Yes, Lord.
Right. Arthur, King of the Britons.
Your knights of the Round Table shall have a task
to make them an example in these dark times.
-Good idea, Oh Lord! -Course it's a good idea!
Behold, Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.
Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task
to seek this Grail.
That is your purpose, Arthur.
The quest for the Holy Grail.
-A blessing from the Lord. -God be praised!
Halt!
Hello!
Hello!
[in French accent] Hello. Who is it?
It is King Arthur, and these are my knights of the Round Table.
Whose castle is this?
This is the castle of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God
with a sacred quest.
If he will give us food and shelter for the night,
he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen.
He's already got one, you see.
What?
He says they've already got one!
-Are you sure he's got one? -Oh, yes. It's very nice.
I told him we've already got one.
Well... can we come up and have a look?
Of course not! You are English-types.
-Well, what are you then? -I'm French.
Why do you think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king?
-What are you doing in England? -Mind your own business.
If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle by force.
You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!
Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person.
I blow my nose at you, so-called Arthur King.
You and all your silly English k... nights.
-What a strange person. -Now look here, my good man--
I don't want to talk to you no more,
you empty-headed, animal food-trough wiper.
I fart in your general direction.
Your mother was a hamster,
and your father smelt of elderberries.
Is there someone else up there we could talk to?
No. Now go away, or I shall taunt you a second time.
Now, this is your last chance. I've been more than reasonable...
-Fetchez la vache! -Quoi?
Fetchez la vache!
If you do not agree to my commands, then I shall--
Jesus Christ!
-Crikey! -Ow!
Right! Charge!
[knights] Charge!
Run away! Run away!
-Fiends! I'll tear them apart. -No, no.
Sir, I have a plan, sir.
-[man 1] Un cadeau. -[man 2] What?
-[man 1] A present. -[man 2] Un cadeau.
-[man 1] Oui, oui, allons-y. -[man 2] What?
What happens now?
Well, now, Lancelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall,
and then leap out of the rabbit, taking the French by surprise.
Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!
Who leaps out?
Lancelot, Galahad, and I...
leap out of the rabbit... and...
Um... Look. If we built this large, wooden badger...
Run away! [all] Run away!
History for Schools. Take 8. Action!
Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur.
seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur.
The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise.
And Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required
if the quest for the Holy Grail
were to be brought to a successful conclusion.
Arthur, having consulted his closest knights,
decided that they should separate,
and search for the Grail individually.
Now, this is what they did.
Frank!

So, each of the knights went their separate ways.
Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing,

[narrator] The tale of Sir Galahad.
Open the door! Open the door!
In the name of King Arthur, open the door!
Hello!
Welcome, gentle Sir Knight. Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.
-The Castle Anthrax? -Yes.
It's not a very good name, is it?
Oh, but we are nice,
and we will attend to your every, every need!
You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
-The what? -The Grail. It is here?
Oh, but you are tired, and you must rest awhile.
Midget! Crapper!
-Yes, O Zoot? -Prepare a bed for our guest.
-Oh thank you, Zoot. -Thank you.
Away, away, varletesses!
The beds here are warm and soft, and very, very big.
Well, look, I--
What is your name, handsome knight?
Sir Galahad the Chaste.
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot.
Oh, but come.
No! Please, in God's name, show me the Grail.
Oh, you have suffered much. You are delirious.
Look, I have seen it. It is here.
Sir Galahad!
You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.
Well, I...
Well, I... Oh, I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet,
compared to yours.
We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes,
all between 16 and 19 and a half,
cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.
Oh, it is a lonely life.
Bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear.
We are just not used to handsome knights.
Nay. Come. You may lie here.
-Oh, but you are wounded! -No, it's nothing!
You must see the doctors immediately. Please, lie down.
Well, what seems to be the trouble?
They're doctors?
Uh, they have a basic medical training, yes.
Oh, come, come, you must try to rest.
Dr. Piglet! Dr. Winston! Practice your art.
Try to relax.
Are you sure that's absolutely necessary? We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Please. We are doctors.
Look, this cannot be!
-I am sworn to chastity! -Back to your bed at once!
Torment me no longer. I have seen the Grail.
-There's no Grail here. -I have seen it.
-I have seen-- -[women] Hello.
Hello. [women] Hello.
Zoot!
Zoot! No. I am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.
Oh, but excuse me--
-Where are you going? -I seek the Grail.
I have seen it here in this castle!
No! Oh, no!
Bad, bad, Zoot!
-What is it? -Wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!
She has been setting light to our beacon,
which, I've just remembered, is Grail-shaped.
It's not the first time we've had this problem.
It's not the real Grail?
Wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot.
She is a bad person, and must pay the penalty.
Do you think this scene should have been cut?
We were so worried when the boys were writing it.
But now we're glad.
It's better than some of the previous scenes, I think.
At least ours was better visually.
At least ours was committed. It wasn't just a string of pussy jokes.
-Get on with it. -Yes. Get on with it!
Get on with it!
-I am enjoying this scene. -Get on with it!
Oh, wicked, wicked Zoot!
She must pay the penalty.
And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment
for setting alight the Grail-shaped beacon.
You must tie her down on a bed, and spank her.
[girls] A spanking! A spanking!
You must spank her well, and after you've spanked her,
you may deal with her as you like.
-And, then, spank me. -And me!
-And me. -And me.
Yes. You must give us all a good spanking!
A spanking! A spanking!
And, after the spanking, the oral sex.
The oral sex!
Well, I could stay a bit longer.
-Sir Galahad! -Oh, hello.
-Quick! You are in great peril. -Why?
-No, he isn't! -Silence, foul temptress!
-She's got a point. -We'll cover your escape!
-Look, I'm fine! -Wait, Sir Galahad!
I can tackle this lot single-handed!
Yes, let him tackle us single-handed!
No, Sir Galahad. Come!
No, really. I can cope. I can handle this lot easily!
-Yes, let him handle us easily. -Go! Quick!
Wait! Please! I can defeat them! There's only 150 of them!
Yes! He'll beat us easily. We haven't a chance.
Oh, shit!
-You were in great peril. -I don't think I was.
Yes, you were. You were in terrible peril.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril.
No, it's too perilous.
It's my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can.
No, we've got to find the Holy Grail. Come on!
Let me have just a little bit of peril?
No. It's unhealthy.
-I bet you're gay. -No, I'm not.
[narrator] Sir Lancelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation.
But, they were still no nearer the Grail.
Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere,
not more than a swallow's flight away, had discovered something.
That's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously.
They were more than two laden swallow's flights away.
Four, if they had a coconut on a line between them.
I mean, If the birds were--
Get on with it!
Oh, anyway, on to Scene 24, which is a smashing scene,
with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a vital clue.
There aren't any swallows, but I think you can hear a st--
And this enchanter of whom you speak, he has seen the Grail?
Where does he live?
Old man, where does he live?
He knows of a cave. A cave which no man has entered.
And the Grail. The Grail is there?
There is much danger.
For beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril,
which no man has ever crossed.
But the Grail. Where is the Grail?
Seek you the Bridge of Death.
The Bridge of Death which leads to the Grail?
Ni! Ni! Ni!
Who are you?
We are the knights who say "Ni"!
No! Not the knights who say "Ni"?
-The same! -[man] Who are they?
We are the keepers of the sacred words.
"Ni," "Peng," and "Neee Wom"!
Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale.
The knights who say "Ni" demand a sacrifice.
Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers
who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
-Ni! Ni! Ni! -[knights groan]
We shall say "Ni" again to you, if you do not appease us.
-What is it you want? -We want...
a shrubbery.
A what?
-Ni! Ni! Ni! -[knights groan]
Please! Please! No more! We will find you a shrubbery.
You must return with a shrubbery,
or else you will never pass through this wood...
alive.
Knights of Ni, you are just and fair.
-We will return with a shrubbery. -One that looks nice.
-Of course. -And not too expensive.
-Yes. -Now...
go!
-[loud thud] -Oh! God! -Hm. Hm! -[thudding continues]
Stop that! Stop that! Stop that!
Go on, clear off! Go on, go away!
Do it! Go away!
And you, clear off!
-[church bell rings] -Huh. Bloody weather.
[narrator] The tale of Sir Lancelot.
One day, lad, all this will be yours.
-What, the curtains? -No, not the curtains, lad.
All that you can see,
stretched out over the hills and valleys of this land.
That'll be your kingdom, lad.
-But, Mother. -Father, lad, father.
But, Father, I don't want any of that.
Listen, lad.
I built this kingdom up from nothing.
When I started here, all there was was a swamp.
Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp.
But I built it all the same, just to show them.
It sank into the swamp. So, I built a second one.
That sank into the swamp.
So, I built a third one. That burned down,
So, I built a third one. That burned down, fell over, then sank in the swamp.
But the fourth one stayed up.
And that's what you're gonna get, lad.
The strongest castle in these isles.
But I don't want any of that.
-I'd rather-- -Rather what?
-I'd rather just... -[theatrical music]
-Sing! -Stop that.
-[music stops] -You're not going into a song while I'm here!
Now, listen, lad.
In 20 minutes, you're getting married to a girl
whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.
-But I don't want land. -Listen, Alice.
-Herbert. -Herbert.
We live on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
-But I don't like her. -Don't like her?
What's wrong with her?
She's beautiful, she's rich. She's got huge...
tracts of land.
I know, but I want the girl that I marry to have...
-A certain special something. -[theatrical music]
Cut that out! Cut that out! -[music stops]
You're marrying Princess Lucky,
so you'd better get used to the idea!
Guards!
Make sure the prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
Not to leave the room, even if you come and get him.
-[hiccups] -No. Until I come and get him.
Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.
No, you stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
-And you'll come and get him. -Right.
We don't need to do anything,
apart from just stop him entering the room.
-No. Leaving the room. -Leaving the room, yes.
-All right? -Right. If...
-lf we're... -Yes, what is it?
-If... -Look, it's quite simple.
You just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
-All right? -[hiccups]
-All right? -[hiccups] -Oh, I remember. Can he leave the room with us?
No, you just keep him in here, and make sure--
Yes! We'll keep him in here, obviously.
But if he had to leave and we were with him--
No. Keep just him in here!
-Until you, or anyone else-- -Not anyone, just me.
-Just you... get back. -Get back.
-Right? -Right.
We'll stay here until you get back.
-And make sure he doesn't leave. -What?
-Make sure he doesn't leave. -The prince?
Yes, make sure he doesn't leave.
Oh, yes, of course! I thought you meant him!
It seemed a bit daft me having to guard him when he's a guard.
-Is that clear? -Quite clear. No problems.
Right.
-Where are you going? -We're coming with you.
No, I want you to stay here, and make sure he doesn't leave.
I see, right.
But, Father...
Shut your noise, you, and get that suit on.
-And no singing! -[music stops]
-[hiccups] -Go and get a glass of water.
-Well taken, Concorde! -Thank you, sir, most kind.
And again!
Over we go! Good, steady!
Now, the big one!
Come on, Concorde!
Message for you, sir.
Concorde! Concorde, speak to me!
"To whoever finds this note.
I have been imprisoned by my father,
who wishes me to marry against my will.
Please, please come and rescue me.
I am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle."
At last! A call! A cry of distress!
This could be the sign that leads us to the Holy Grail!
Brave, brave Concorde, you shall not have died in vain!
Uh, I'm not quite dead, sir.
You shall not have been mortally wounded in vain!
I think I could pull through, sir.
Oh, I see.
I think I'm all right to come with you.
No, sweet Concorde! Stay here.
I will send help as soon as I have accomplished a daring
and heroic rescue in my own particular...
-Idiom, sir? -Idiom!
-No, I feel fine, actually, sir. -Farewell, sweet Concorde!
I'll just stay here, shall I, sir?
Yeah.
-Morning. -Morning.
Hey!
You're not allowed to enter the room--
Fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Lancelot of Camelot.
I have come to take-- I'm terribly sorry.
You got my note!
-Well, I got a note. -You've come to rescue me?
-Well, no, you see-- -I knew someone would.
I knew that somewhere out there,
-there must be someone... -[theatrical music]
-Stop that! Stop that! Stop it! Stop it! -[music stops]
Who are you?
-I'm your son. -No, not you.
I'm Sir Lancelot, sir.
He's come to rescue me, Father.
-Let's not jump to conclusions. -Did you kill all those guards?
Uh... Oh, yes. Sorry.
-They cost 50 pounds each. -I'm awfully sorry.
Don't be afraid of him, Sir Lancelot.
I've got a rope all ready.
You killed eight wedding guests and all!
Well, you see, I thought your son was a lady.
I can understand that.
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot! Hurry! -Shut up!
You only killed the bride's father, that's all.
Well, I really didn't mean to.
Didn't mean to? You put your sword right through his head!
Oh, dear. Is he all right?
You kicked the bride in the chest! It's going to cost me a fortune!
I can explain, I was in the forest, riding north from Camelot,
-when I got this note. -Camelot?
-Are you from Camelot? -Hurry, Sir Lancelot!
I'm a knight of King Arthur, sir.
Very nice castle, Camelot. Very good pig country.
-Is it? -Hurry! I am ready!
Would you like to come have a drink?
That's awfully nice of you.
I am ready!
I mean, to be so understanding.
You see, when I'm in this idiom, I sometimes get a bit carried away.
Now, this is the main hall. We're gonna have all this knocked through and made into--
We're gonna have all this knocked through and made into--
-There he is! -[King] Oh, bloody hell.
Hold it! Hold it, please!
Sorry! You see what I mean, I just get carried away.
I'm really most awfully sorry. Sorry, everyone.
-He's killed the best man! -[people shout]
Hold it, please, hold it!
This is Sir Lancelot from the court of Camelot,
a very brave and influential knight.
And my special guest here today. -Hello. -He killed my auntie!
-Hello. -He killed my auntie!
No, please! Please!
This is supposed to be a happy occasion!
Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who.
We are here today to witness the union of two young people
in the joyful bond of a holy wedlock.
Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert,
-has just fallen to his death. -[people groan]
But I don't want to think I've lost a son, so much as...
gained a daughter.
For, since the tragic death of her father--
He's not quite dead!
Since the near fatal wounding of her father--
He's getting better!
For, since her own father,
who, when he seemed about to recover,
suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him.
-[man groans] -Oh, he's died!
I want his only daughter to look upon me
as her own dad, in a very real, and legally binding sense.
And I feel sure that the merger--
the union between the Princess
and the brave but dangerous Sir Lancelot of Camelot...
-What? -Look, the dead prince!
-He's not quite dead! -I feel much better.
You fell out of the tall tower, you creep!
No, I was saved at the last minute.
-How? -Well, I'll tell you.
-[music starts] -Not like that! Not like that.

No, it's not right for my idiom. I must escape more...

-♪ But he's here with us today ♪ -[crash]
♪ What a wonderful escape ♪
[Lancelot] Excuse me, could somebody give me a push, please?
Old crone!
Is there anywhere in this town where we could buy a shrubbery?
-Who sent you? -The knights who say "Ni"!
[groans] No! We have no shrubberies here.
If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery,
my friend and I will say...
We will say "Ni."
[groans] Do your worst!
Very well. If you will not assist us voluntarily...
-Ni! -No!
Never. No shrubberies.
-Ni! -Noo!
No, no, no. No, it's not that, it's "Ni."
-Noo. -No, no. "Ni." You're not doing it properly.
-Ni. -That's it! You've got it.
-Ni! Ni! Ni! -Ni! Ni! Ni!
Are you saying "Ni" to that old woman?
Um... Yes.
Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians
can say "Ni" at will to old ladies.
There is a pestilence upon this land. Nothing is sacred.
Even those who arrange and design shrubberies
are under considerable economic stress at this period in history.
-Did you say "shrubberies"? -Yes.
Shrubberies are my trade. I am a shrubber.
My name is Roger the Shrubber.
I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.
-Ni! -No, no, no, no. No!
Oh Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery.
-May we go now? -It is a good shrubbery.
I like the laurels particularly. But there is one small problem.
What is that?
We are now no longer the knights who say "Ni."
-Ni! -Shh!
We are now the knights who say
"Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptang
-Zoo Boing Arouza"! -Ni!
Therefore, we must give you a test.
What is this test, oh Knights who until recently said "Ni"?
Firstly, you must find...
another shrubbery!
-[knights babble] -Not another shrubbery!
Then, when you have found the shrubbery,
you must place it here beside this shrubbery.
Only slightly higher, so you get the two-level effect
with a little path running down the middle.
A path! A path!
Then, when you have found the shrubberies,
you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest
with...
-a herring! -A herring! A herring!
-We shall do no such thing. -Oh, please.
Cut down a tree with a herring? It can't be done.
-Don't say that word. -What word?
I cannot tell. Suffice to say,
it's one of the words the Knights of Ni cannot hear.
How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is?
-He did it again. -What? "Is"?
No, not "is"! You wouldn't get very far in life not saying "is."
My liege, it's Robin.
♪ He's jacking it in and packing it up ♪
♪ And sneaking away and buggering off ♪
♪ And chickening out and pissing a pot ♪
♪ Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge ♪
-Robin. -My liege.
-It's good to see you. -Now he's said the word!
Surely, you haven't given up your quest for the Holy Grail?
-♪ He is sneaking away and-- ♪ -Shut up!
-No, far from it. -You said the word again.
-I was looking for it... -[screams]
...uh, here in this forest.
-No, it is far from this place. -[screams] Stop saying the word!
-The word we cannot hear! -Oh, stop it!
-He said "it" again! -That's it!
I've said "it." I've said "it." I've said "it" again!
And there again, that's three "its"!
[narrator] And so Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on their search to find
the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in Scene 24.
Beyond the forest they met Lancelot and Galahad,
and there was much rejoicing.
[men] Yay!
In the frozen land of Nador,
they were forced to eat Robin's minstrels.
And there was much rejoicing.
[men] Yay!
A year passed.
-Winter changed into spring. -Nice.
Spring changed into summer.
Summer changed back into winter,
and winter gave spring and summer a miss
and went straight on into autumn.
Until one day.
Knights...
forward!
What manner of man are you that can summon up fire -without flint or tinder? -I...
-without flint or tinder? -I...
am an enchanter.
-By what name are you known? -There are some who call me...
-Tim. -Greetings, Tim the Enchanter!
Greetings, King Arthur.
-You know my name? -I do.
You seek the Holy Grail.
That is our quest. You know much that is hidden, oh Tim.
Quite.
Yes, we are looking for the Holy Grail.
Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.
Yes, it is.
-And so we're looking for it. -Yes, we are.
-We have been for some time. -Ages.
So, anything you could do to help would be...
very... helpful.
Look, can you tell us where--?
Fine, I don't want to waste any more of your time,
but I don't suppose you could tell us
where we might find a... find a... a, uh...
A what?
A Grail?
Yes, I think so.
[all] Yes.
Yes!
-Oh. Thank you. -Splendid!
Look, you're a busy man--
Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail. Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you. To the north, there lies a cave. The Cave of Caerbannog.
Wherein, carved in mystic runes, upon the very living rock,
the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged...
...make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Where could we find this cave, oh Tim?
Follow!
But follow only if ye be men of valor.
For the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature
so foul, so cruel,
that no man yet has fought with it and lived.
Bones of full 50 men lie strewn about its lair.
So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage
or your strength, come no further,
for death awaits you all with nasty, big, pointy teeth.
What an eccentric performance.
They're nervous, sire.
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on, on foot.
Dismount!
Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!
-Right, keep me covered. -What with?
-Just keep me covered. -Too late.
There he is!
-Where? -There.
What, behind the rabbit?
It is the rabbit.
-You silly sod! -What?
You got us all worked up.
That's no ordinary rabbit.
That's the most foul, cruel and bad-tempered rodent
you ever set eyes on.
You tit! I soiled my armor I was so scared!
Look, that rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide.
-It's a killer! -Get stuffed.
-He'll do you up a treat, mate! -Yeah?
-You manky Scots git! -I'm warning you.
-What's he do? Nibble your bum? -He's got huge, sharp...
It can leap about...
Look at the bones!
Go on, Bors, chop its head off.
Right. Silly little bleeder. One rabbit stew coming right up.
-Look! -[rabbit squeaks]
-Jesus Christ! -I warned you!
-I've done it again. -I warned you.
But did you listen to me? No, you knew it all, didn't you?
Oh, it's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?
Well, it's always the same. I always--
-Oh, shut up! -Do they listen to me? Oh no.
-Charge! -[men shout]
Run away! Run away!
-Right. How many did we lose? -Gawain.
-Ector. -And Bors. That's five.
-Three, sir. -Three. Three.
We better not risk another frontal assault, that rabbit's dynamite.
Would it help to confuse it if we run away more?
-Shut up and change your armor. -Let us taunt it.
It may become so cross that it will make a mistake.
Like what?
Well...
-Have we got bows? -No.
-We have the Holy Hand Grenade. -Yes, of course!
The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.
It's one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him.
Brother Maynard! Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade.
How does it... How does it work?
How does it... How does it work? -I know not, my liege. -[Arthur] Consult the Book of Armaments.
-I know not, my liege. -[Arthur] Consult the Book of Armaments.
Armaments chapter 2: verses 9-21.
"And St. Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying,
'O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade,
that with it thou mayest
blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.'
And the Lord did grin and the people did feast
upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans
and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and--"
Skip a bit, Brother.
"And the Lord spake, saying,
'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin,
then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.
Three shalt be the number thou shalt count,
and the number of the counting shalt be three.
Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two,
excepting that thou then proceed to three.
Five is right out.
Once the number three, being the third number be reached,
then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch
towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight,
shall snuff it."'
-Amen. -Amen.
Right.
One, two, five!
-Three, sir! -Three!
There! Look!
-What does it say? -What language is that?
Brother Maynard, you're our scholar.
It is Aramaic!
Of course. Joseph of Arimathea!
-Of course. -What does it say?
It reads, "Here may be found
the last words of Joseph of Arimathea.
He who is valiant and pure of spirit
may find the Holy Grail
in the Castle of Aaargh."'
What?
"The Castle of Aaargh."
What is that?
He must have died while carving it.
-Oh, come on! -Well, that's what it says.
Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve "Aaargh."
He'd just say it.
That's what's carved in the rock.
-Perhaps he was dictating it. -Oh shut up!
-Does it say anything else? -No!
Just "Aaargh."
-Aaargh. -Aaargh.
Do you suppose he meant the Camargue?
-Where's that? -In France, I think.
Isn't there a St. Aaargh's in Cornwall?
No, that's St. Ives.
-Oh, yes. St. Ives. -St. Ives.
No, "Aaargh." At the back of the throat.
No no no, "Ooh," in surprise and alarm!
-You mean a sort of an "Ah!" -Yes, that's right.
My God!
It's the legendary Black Beast of...
That's it! That's it!
Run away! Run away!
Keep running.
-Shh. Shh. -We've lost him. -[beast roars] -[men scream]
[narrator] As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward,
escape for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless.
When, suddenly, the animator suffered a fatal heart attack.
The cartoon peril was no more.
The quest for the Holy Grail could continue.
There it is!
-The Bridge of Death. -Oh, great.
Look! There's the old man from Scene 24.
What's he doing here?
He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.
He asks each traveler five questions.
-Three questions. -Three questions.
He who answers the five questions--
Three questions.
...three questions, may cross in safety.
What if you get a question wrong?
Then you are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.
Oh, wacko.
Who's going to answer the questions?
-Sir Robin? -Yes?
Brave Sir Robin, you go.
Hey! I've got a great idea.
Why doesn't Lancelot go?
Yes, let me go, my liege. I will take him single-handed.
I shall make a feint to the northeast--
No. Hang on! Hang on!
Just answer the five questions--
Three questions.
...three questions, as best you can.
And we shall watch and pray.
I understand, my liege.
Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot. God be with you.
Stop!
Who would cross the Bridge of Death, must answer me these questions three.
Ere the other side he see.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper. I'm not afraid.
What is your name?
My name is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.
What is your quest?
To seek the Holy Grail.
What is your favorite color?
-Blue. -Right. Off you go.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.
That's easy.
Stop!
Who approacheth the Bridge of Death, must answer me these questions three.
Ere the other side he see.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper. I'm not afraid.
-What is your name? -Sir Robin of Camelot.
-What is your quest? -To seek the Holy Grail.
What is the capital of Assyria?
I don't know that!
Stop!
-What is your name? -Sir Galahad of Camelot.
-What is your quest? -I seek the Grail.
What is your favorite color?
Blue.
No! Yellow!
Stop!
What is your name?
It is Arthur, King of the Britons.
-What is your quest? -To seek the Holy Grail.
What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?
What do you mean? An African or European swallow?
I don't know that.
How do you know so much about swallows?
You have to know these things when you're a king, you know.
Lancelot! Lancelot!
The Castle Aargh. Our quest is at an end.
God be praised.
Almighty God,
we thank thee, that thou hast vouchsafed
to us the most holy-- -[thudding sound] -[sheep bleats]
Jesus Christ!
Hello, stuffy English knights
and Monsieur Arthur King, who has the brain of a duck, you know.
So, we French fellows outwit you a second time.
How dare you profane this place with your presence?
I command you, in the name of the Knights of Camelot,
to open the doors of this sacred castle,
to which God himself has guided us.
How you English say?
One more time, I unclog my nose in your direction,
sons of a window-dresser!
So, you think you could out-clever us French folk
with your silly knees-bent,
running about, advancing behavior.
I wave my private parts at your aunties.
You cheesy lot of second-hand, electric donkey-bottom biters!
In the name of the Lord,
we demand entrance to this sacred castle!
No chance, English bed-wetting types.
I burst my pimples at you,
and call your door-opening request a silly thing!
You tiny-brained wipers of other people's bottoms.
If you'll not open this door, we shall take this castle by force!
In the name of God and the glory of our--
-[men laugh] -Right! That settles it!
Yes, depart at this time, and don't be approaching any more,
or we fire arrows in the tops of your heads,
and make castanets out of your testicles already.
Walk away, just ignore them.
And now remain gone, illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!
And, if you think you got a nasty taunting this time,
you ain't heard nothing yet, stuffy English k-nights!
-We shall attack at once. -Yes, my liege.
Stand by for attack!
French persons!
Today the blood of many a valiant knight shall be avenged.
In the name of God, we shall not stop our fight
till each one of you lies dead, and the Holy Grail
till each one of you lies dead, and the Holy Grail returns to those whom God has chosen!
returns to those whom God has chosen!
Charge!
Yes, they're the ones, I'm sure.
Right, come on. Get back. Get back right away.
-Put him in the van. -Get a blanket over that one.
Come on, back! Right back!
That's an offensive weapon, that is.
-You're supposed to let it happen. -I'm not, you're pushing it.
I am not. You're doing it again. You're pushing it. Stop it.
Mom, Larry's pushing it.
Larry, don't push it.
I'm not. It's moving itself.
Wait, I have to write this down.
Grandma told me everyone has a soul mate.
This way, I'll know his name. The one I'm supposed to wait for.
The one that will wait for me.
Yeah, Faith, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago?
What if he's a cave man and now he's dead?
Don't be stupid, Larry. Soul mates are our destiny.
They live when we live.
What if he lives here in Pittsburgh...
...and one day you pass him on the street?
It couldn't happen, Larry, I'd know.
Like when bees know how to make honey.
And you'll know too.
Because you have one.
We all do.
Look.
DAMON BRADLEY
Damon Bradley.
My other half.
My soul mate.
She wants to know if she's going to marry Alex.
I do not. He doesn't even have a brain.
But he's got pretty eyes...
...that means your kids would have pretty eyes.
He can always get a brain later.
What do you think, Faith?
The most important thing is true love.
Isn't that right, Kate?
Look out below!
Larry, I hate you.
-She's gonna be so mad. -I know.
-He's a jerk. -So what?
Next.
So, what destiny do you wish from Madame Divina?
Just basic destiny stuff, I guess.
But I don't wanna hear anything bad, if that's okay?
Something's coming to me.
I'm getting a name.
A name that is very important.
David?
No.
Damon.
His name...
...is Damon Bradley.
Oh, my God.
Your destiny is $2.
The truth is...
...you make your own destiny.
Understand?
Don't wait for it to come to you.
14 years later
Destino...
...from the Latin root destinare...
...meaning...
...to have destination...
...to journey...
...to take a trip where the events are totally predetermined.
Imagine that.
The motion of like attracting like.
The motion of a divine preordination.
Okay. Look, one hand, two hands.
Put them together...
...and what do they make?
One.
Right. So Plato tells us we began as circles.
And when we strived to be like the gods, we were punished...
...by a thunderbolt that struck us...
...and cut us right down dead center in half.
We scattered to the ends of the Earth...
...searching and searching...
...for our other half.
Now Plato was saying...
...is that if we just stop...
...and go with the flow...
...and follow our destiny...
...it'll lead us back to each other.
Okay.
Still following this, read from your green book.
Remember one Wordsworth, one Keats or one Shelley.
Either one. Have a great holiday.
-Don't get up, Leslie, I got everything. -Did you want me to help?
-No, I don't want you to strain yourself. -I would've helped.
What's all this, Faith? What's going on?
Wine, candles, what is it?
He proposed.
Oh, Faith, that's great.
Did he get down on his knees?
Well, no. He turned down his beeper.
He's a doctor. He's practical. He doesn't have to get down--
Hey, hey, did you guys set a date?
No. I don't think we should rush into anything.
Oh, let me see the ring.
-Where is it? -Oh, my gosh, it--
You don't have it on?
-Oh, Faith. -I'm blind.
-It's pretty. Where are my sunglasses? -Oh, my goodness.
It's gorgeous. I hate you.
I asked him to give me 24 hours to think about it.
I'm never going to get divorced...
...so I'm just--
I'm telling you what I told him.
That I need time to reflect...
...and that I'm going to say yes.
Oh, for God's sakes, I told my parents I'm engaged.
-Then it's official. -Your mom must be happy.
Dwayne, what a catch. He's a doctor.
-He's intelligent. -He's a doctor, what do you want?
-Good sense of humor too. -He's got a mild sense of humor.
He's a doctor. He can't have a sense of humor too.
-He saves lives. -He's a foot doctor.
Saves feet. Feet are important.
He's tall. Your kids will be tall.
Yeah, yeah. And he's a sweetheart.
You don't have to sell me on him. He's as good as gold.
What is it you're waiting for, Faith?
I'm not waiting.
Would you get me a beer?
Faith, don't wait. You wait, you'll wind up with nothing.
Hello?
Oh, yeah, hi, Larry. Yeah, she's here.
Hold on. My brother for you.
Stop it. Don't eat my crust, Leslie.
-Hello? -Kate?
You're still there? Thought you'd be on your way home by now.
-I'm not. I'm here. -What are you doing there?
I'm hanging out with your sister and Leslie. What is it? You miss me?
Yeah, my heart's breaking for you. Did you forget what night it is?
The guys are coming over for poker.
Oh, I didn't know you wanted me to play. I'll rush home.
Very funny. Get home, make some sandwiches...
...and pick up some beer and pop on your way home.
Come on, this is my one-night out. The kids are at Gus's.
-Give me a break. -Kate, I still got a lot of work to do.
Yeah, I've been in class all day.
Class? What the hell is class?
Guys are gonna be there with nothing to eat!
I'm a woman, Larry, not a menu.
Helen Reddy, huh?
All of a sudden, you're Helen Reddy. I want you to get home.
You're gonna embarrass me.
You have to fend for yourself, I'm not coming home, Larry.
I gotta go.
What?
It's Ezio Pinza.
Ezio who?
He was in South Pacific with Mary Martin.
Why don't they write songs like this anymore?
I'm gonna get going, guys.
No, no, no. You gotta stay and watch this.
You'll feel her call you
Across a crowded room then--
Saw a psychiatrist on Donahue say...
...that love songs are just a cruel hoax that feed people's fantasies.
Romance on a daily basis? Nobody has that.
Yeah, but, Kate, somebody wrote those songs.
They came from somebody's experience.
No. I think they came out of someone's imagination.
Once you have found him Never let him go
Once you have found her
Never let her go
Oh, my gosh.
-Look how it sparkles. -She's a beauty.
It must have cost a lot of money.
Yeah, I did research on diamonds for this.
You know, I learned a lot about gemstones.
It's amazing how many variations you find of pure carbon...
...crystallized into octahedrons.
Oh, but here's my real gemstone right here.
Sweet.
Oh, I know you don't like that. I'm sorry.
-That's okay. Is it all off? Great. -Yes. I got it.
Honey, I hate to pull you away.
You've gotta show this to Aunt Gloria and Aunt Lilly.
They came from Pottsville. They're gonna faint.
-May I see it one more time? -Oh, Leslie.
Oh, my God, it's perfect!
Come on, sweetheart. Come on, come on.
I feel like busting out crying.
-I have a headache. -Again, you have a headache?
Yes, but not one of those headaches, Larry.
I have 50 bobby pins holding my hair together.
What is this? It's down. Put it up.
Look, it's not an exploitation. Everybody wants money, all right?
That's what makes this country great, doll.
Don't call me doll, okay?
-You loved it when I called you doll. -Well, you said it differently then.
Faith?
-Faith. -Oh, yes.
I wore it.
My daughter wore it. And I want you to have the same joy.
And I must say I was thrilled when Dwayne said you would wear it.
Dwayne?
Dwayne. Dwayne.
We gotta go. She's got another one of her headaches.
It's a bobby pin headache, Mom. Talk to you later.
The party isn't even remotely--
-We're going. Can I have the keys? -I've got the keys. Let's go.
Well, good night. Katy, call me early?
Faith, I gotta go.
Call you tomorrow.
-It would mean a lot to her-- -Means a lot to me. It's our wedding.
-She's not a young anymore. -She's been married twice.
Surely we can find in our hearts to do this one thing for her.
-Will you think about it? Oh, my God. -You just didn't ask me.
Here comes your crazy Uncle Pat. He wants to take another picture.
-Remember to ask me next time. -Let me fix your hair.
-It's supposed to be like that. Dwayne. -Dear, now you're perfect.
One more. Good one.
-Sorry, I'm late, Faith. -Don't look.
Oh, dear. Okay. Guess what? I'm free.
My mom and dad took the kids to the lake for the Labor Day weekend.
So I was running around getting all of that stuff together.
-Dwayne's not coming over, is he? -No.
He had emergency surgery.
Okay...
...you can look.
Faith, that's a dress.
I've decided it's romantic.
Wearing the gown of the woman who bore your husband.
I mean, my daughter will wear it too.
Someday.
Maybe not.
Wait a second. Put the veil on.
It'll be okay.
Sweet of her, wasn't it?
Yes. If I had this dress, I'd give it to someone.
I look like a muffin.
No. You look fine.
Did it come with a soundtrack?
I think it's built up in here somewhere.
It's probably plenty of things.
You know what it is? The thickness. We'll fix it, don't worry.
I'll pin it a little bit and see what we can do.
Life's not like it is in the movies, right?
No, it's not.
Although from day one, everyone conspires to tell you it is.
Your mother, your father, teachers, priests, everybody.
Dreams come true, the good guy wins.
People live happily ever after. All that crap.
Then one day you wake up and realize...
...that your life should be different.
Katy, dreams aren't crap and--
Well, okay, what about unforgettable moments?
You can't tell me you don't have one memorable, unforgettable moment...
...because I know you've had thousands of them.
We're having one right now. I'm in my wedding dress, Katy.
Those are the things to notice.
Kate, what's wrong?
I don't know.
Faith, I gotta talk to you about something.
What?
Larry and I, we're just....
I'm sorry. I have to answer. Dwayne's having his calls forwarded.
Don't move.
Don't move.
-Hello? -Dr. Dwayne Johnson please.
He's not in at the moment.
He's doing an emergency matrixectomy.
-Can I take a message? -Who's this?
This is Faith, his fiancée. Who's this?
Hi. I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.
Congratulations on your wedding.
-Thanks. -I'm gonna be in Europe...
-...I'm gonna miss it. -That's too bad.
-Be careful. -What's your name?
-My name is Damon Bradley. -Oh, I can hardly hear you.
-Can you spell it? Yes. -Yeah, D-A-M-O-N.
-Yes. Yeah, yeah. -B-R-A-D-L-E-Y.
Yeah, I-- What?
-Hello? Are you okay? Hello? -What?
-What's going on? Who is it? -Hello? Are you still there? Hello?
-Damon Bradley? -Yeah.
-Where are you? -I'm at the airport. Why?
-Where are you going? -I'm on my way to Venice. Why?
-Where's he going? -Oh, I love Venice.
Yeah, I gotta run now but maybe someday we can all get together.
I-- Well, I--
He, he hung up.
-He hung up. -It's okay, honey.
-He'll call back. Right? -I don't know.
-Get me out of this. -Hold on, there's a million buttons.
-Whoa, okay, spin, spin, spin. -No.
Jesus, where are you going?
The airport. Call a cab.
You can't go to an airport, look for somebody.
I'm downstairs.
Well, change your dress!
Faith, it's a coincidence!
It is not a coincidence. You don't understand. It's fate.
I just wanna get a look at him, that's all.
Come on, Faith, this is insane!
Stop!
Be careful. Oh, God.
-Watch it. -Good luck.
Watch it.
Oh, sorry.
Excuse me, sisters.
Flight 491 to Lithuania is now preboarding at Gate 12.
Flight 417?
-Flight's closed. -Whenever you're ready.
-Your boarding pass? -I--
I misplaced it.
I'm sorry but without a boarding pass, we cannot let you on the plane.
Okay.
-I've got it here somewhere. -Like I said until you find it...
...we can't let you on the plane.
Look, this is a real emergency.
Can you please let me on the plane for just one second?
I really need to see somebody on that plane.
I'm sorry. We have very strict rules. They are for your own safety.
You could affect my life.
Just a moment, please.
Yeah, this is Eric over at TWA.
We've a 237 on our hands here.
Yeah.
Thanks.
It'll be just a moment.
The man I was supposed to marry is on that plane.
Yeah.
And I am telling you, it is a miracle.
Sure. That will be fine.
There is no such thing as a coincidence.
Kate, if I don't get on that plane, I am going to regret it.
No, not today.
But tomorrow and for the rest of my life.
You got it?
No, it's Labor Day weekend.
I don't have any classes until Wednesday.
Oh, thank you.
Okay, my passport's in the top left drawer.
Pack all my nice underwear, anything non-wrinkly.
Don't forget my blow dryer. Oh, Katy, baby, you gotta hurry.
The plane leaves in an hour and 12 minutes, yeah.
Flight 1193....
All passengers....
INFORMATION
Faith! Faith!
-You smashed that lady. -I didn't hurt anyone.
-Faith. -Oh, nice jacket.
-Hi. -I'm coming with you, Faith.
-Are you crazy? -Oh, yeah, I'm crazy. Excuse me--
Sorry.
Well, I'm not letting you go alone, Faith.
What if you make a mistake you'll regret for life?
Do I need to remind you, your wedding is in ten days?
Kate, look...
...I know you think this is irresponsible.
But think how much more irresponsible it would be...
...to marry the wrong person.
I packed jeans and a dress and--
God, I wish I was coming. I wish I had a passport.
Excuse me.
I packed that red dress. That one you never have the guts to wear.
And I got the blow dryer.
Make sure we get an adapter before you plug it in. It could blow up on you.
Why are we doing this? This is insane?
What if Dwayne and I aren't really meant to be?
It's not fair for me to waste his life.
She's right. What if he's really her soul mate?
He's not her soul mate, Leslie. She's never even met this man.
Waited her whole life for somebody with this name.
A name she gets off a board game when she's 11.
You forgot about the fortuneteller.
Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry. We only got five minutes.
-Oh, God. -Goodbye. Have a good time.
-Yeah, oh, my God. -It's your hoops.
-You coming or going to the wedding? -Going.
-I'm sorry. Hey. -Come on.
Goodbye.
So we're just gonna to Italy and comb the streets looking for a stranger...
-...in a foreign land? -He's going to Venice.
Small city. So I called six hotels and found out where he was staying.
Let's go, girls. You're gonna miss the happy day.
So we can see him tomorrow and back the next day?
Exactly. He's registered at the Hotel Danieli.
I can't believe this.
We get all kinds here, don't we? Unbelievable.
-Hotel Gondola. -Hotel Venezia.
-Hotel Gondola. -Hotel Venezia.
-Danieli? -Hotel Gondola.
-Hotel Danieli? Sure? -Hotel Danieli.
-Here. -Hey.
-I have motion sickness, Faith. -It's okay. Oh, my God.
-A boat. -It's gonna be great.
It's not gonna be great. I don't feel well, Faith. I'm tired.
-Give me your hand. -I'm a very good friend.
The most serene. Where people come looking for something...
...they can't find anyplace else.
-Faith, this is a Lifestyles hotel. -What?
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. We can't afford this.
Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Kate.
He could be--
He could be anywhere.
Come on.
Hello. Reservations for Faith Corvatch, please.
And...
...you could put the room on this.
Thanks.
And could you please tell us what room Mr. Bradley is in?
Yes.
I can't stand it.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bradley has already checked out.
Excuse me?
He-- He--
He just-- He just arrived today.
Mr. Bradley left about half an hour ago.
Would you prefer an interior or an exterior--?
You're saying he just checked in and then he checked out?
No, he-- You must be mistaken. He's supposed to be here now.
I'm very sorry. Perhaps you misunderstood.
Perhaps you misunderstood. Could you please check again, sir?
If you would check again, we would really appreciate it.
Thank you so much. Damon Bradley. With a B.
It's Bradley.
Room 217.
Okay, okay.
This key has been returned. I'm afraid your friend has departed.
Well, did he leave any forwarding information?
Which way did he go?
I don't know.
We don't usually follow our guests.
Excuse me, sir. I don't think you understand.
My friend has traveled an awfully long way
So anything you can do to help us, we would appreciate.
Anything, at all.
What? I was just getting going.
Okay.
He ate breakfast.
Thank God. Because I'm starving.
Faith, I think this is the room Cathy Lee Crosby stayed in.
-Kate. -Oh, garbage, good idea.
Columbo always goes through the garbage.
-Butterfinger, Butterfinger. -Map.
Three butterfingers.
A map? Is anything circled?
-Telephone message. -Let me see.
It's in Italian.
Okay, we'll get somebody to read it. Come on. Let's go.
This is a phone number in Rome.
You would like me to call this number and what?
Ask for Damon Bradley.
Just ask, that's all.
-Okay. -Thank you.
And ask whoever answers the phone if they know Mr. Bradley.
Okay.
Or if they know where we might find him.
-Or if they've ever laid eyes on him-- -I'd ask for him, go to the other things.
-But find out if he-- -Okay!
Oh, my God, he's a priest?
It's a store in Rome.
He said he thinks some woman he works with knows him.
Her name's Anna.
But she won't be in till tomorrow.
-Let's go Rome! -Rome?
Rome? Tomorrow?
Tomorrow is Sciopero Generale. Everybody will be on strike.
Good luck.
Everybody's on strike.
No planes, buses, trains. Nobody shows up for work.
What kind of country is this?
FIRENZE POGGIBONSI
The point is we're on the wrong road. We've been on for an hour.
No, no, no. The point is we're looping. We're looping around. See?
We looped right back to that freeway or turnpike.
Or whatever the hell they call it.
El-freeway-o.
ROMA POMARANCE
-Which way do we loop? -Right.
Left. Right, right, right.
Kate!
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
We would have had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.
Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
Right. Less than a mile.
So we should have been able to cover more of them.
I wonder what time it is in Pittsburgh?
Sorry I got us lost.
I'm sorry I'm so edgy.
I'm afraid we're losing him.
I didn't tell him I was going to the lake with the kids.
I told him I was leaving him.
Leaving him?
I think he's having an affair.
How do you know? Did he say something?
No.
-Did you see him with her? -No.
-How do you know? -I just know.
Kate...
...remember in junior high when I had that Halloween party...
...and we all played Twister?
And you started to fall...
...and instead of taking the spot, Larry reached out to catch you?
And he let you win.
He never let anybody win.
That's when I knew he was head over heels.
Yeah, well that was a long time ago.
Well, you know what I thought then?
I thought...
...I hope some day I have somebody who loves me that much.
I know he loves you.
I know he would kill tigers for you.
HELP!! NEED GAS
Okie-doke, Mr. Cronenweth.
Let's just check out this big guy right here.
He looks pretty good.
This is a very simple procedure, Mr. Cronenweth.
Won't take but about five minutes or so.
I'm just gonna make a plaster mold of your foot here.
-That's-- -Dwayne? Dwayne, I gotta talk to you.
I'm plastering a foot. What are you doing?
It'll take a second. Excuse me, sir. Where's Faith?
She's gone to a teacher's conference. Get out.
-She say anything about Kate? -She talks about Kate.
-Yeah, well I think they're together. -What?
Kate left me.
Got home, there was a note.
"I'm leaving and take the clothes out of the dryer."
-That's it. No explanation. Nothing. -What happened?
I don't know. She's been acting weird. I should have seen it coming.
Babbling on and on and on about communication.
Like I don't know how to communicate! Do you believe this woman? Sorry.
Sorry, Mr. Cronenweth. Larry what did you do?
Nothing. I did nothing. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You haven't been fooling around, have you?
No. No. Of course not. Where'd you ever get a crazy idea like that?
I have got to finish this foot mold, okay? I will call you tonight.
If you hear anything, let me know. Good luck, sir.
It's just my future brother-in-law.
Sorry about that.
Oh, this is gonna be a very nice mold.
Taxi!
Taxi.
-Come on― -I got it. Go, go, go, go.
Not a monastery. It's a store.
No priests. You know where that is, sir?
-He knows where it is. -Hey, I'm just asking to make sure.
Don't know why we had to return the car. I would've found it. We're close.
We had to return the rental car because you had us lost.
-What? -We're here already?
I told you we were close.
-Some trip. -Don't tip him.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, good. Thank God.
-I'm looking for a woman named Anna. -I am Anna.
Anna! Oh, my--
Hi. I'm Faith. You don't know how happy I am to meet you.
-I'm looking for somebody. -Kate.
And I was hoping someone here---
Well, you might know him. Damon Bradley.
Damon Bradley?
You know him?
Okay, slow down. What's going on? What is she saying?
Something about a pig.
May I be of assistance?
Yes. Hi. We're trying to find out about somebody named Damon Bradley.
Yes. Could you ask her if she knows where we can find him or--?
He called her from Venice. She's going to meet him...
...at Galeassi Ristorante tonight at Piazza Santa Maria Trastevere.
But she has a prior commitment.
Yes! Thank you. That's all I needed to know.
-Thank you, thank you. -Thanks.
-Oh, thank you. -You are looking for a place to stay.
Well, yeah, as a matter of fact.
-Perhaps I can help. I am Giovanni. -Oh, hi.
-And you are? -Kate.
Kate. I know a pensione, bellissima. And it's very close.
-Really? -Kate.
-What? Faith. -Let's go.
What?
I'm tired. I'm hung-over. I haven't eaten or slept for two days.
So just back off. I want a room.
-You were saying? -Oh, it's this beautiful pensione.
I will take you. It's two blocks away.
-Well, thank you. -Yes.
Bella, no? It's beautiful.
Marcello, senti.
It's like the Trevi Fountain.
Ciao.
Listen, Kate.
I must leave town for two days, go to my shop in Milano.
It was unavoidable.
But the day after tomorrow, I return.
And I hope you'll still be here.
Ciao.
Ciao. Excuse me.
Faith...
...whatever happens tonight, you're gonna be okay.
Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
You could spend your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.
Smile.
-Okay. -Okay.
Go on up there. Ask the maitre'd if he's here and I'll wait.
There he is. The maitre'd. Go ask him.
Go on.
I will. I wanted to see if maybe he'd notice me first.
What?
I wanted to see if maybe he'd notice me--
But you've been waiting since a kid to meet this guy.
This isn't the time to play hard to get.
-Could you go ask? -Me?
Oh, all right. I'm going. I'm going.
I'm gonna go. All right.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
-Okay? -He's here.
Take it easy. Take it easy. He's right inside, by the door.
Right inside.
Back to us. Navy jacket.
And if you turn around now, you can see part of his left elbow.
Oh, I can see his sleeve!
Oh, very exciting. Oh, progress. Good, this is good.
I guess I should just go introduce myself, huh?
You've traveled 4000 miles. What's 15 more feet, right?
This is it.
Sorry.
Kate!
What happened?
Are you okay?
-Where's your shoe? -I don't know.
Okay, okay. Sit down.
Everything's okay.
-Can't say we didn't try, right? -Right.
Okay.
-Here's what I think. -All right, what?
We rent a truck or a car, either one.
And we set up a loudspeaker...
...and we drive through the surrounding areas and we page him.
Don't you think--?
-Oh, how nice. -Oh, yes.
-Si, thank you. -Oh, Americans. Allow me.
Thank you.
So, what do you think?
That's kind of sweet, huh?
I meant about my idea.
Oh, well...
...I think it's time we got some professional help.
-Like a detective? -Like a psychiatrist.
How's a psychiatrist going to find him?
No, dear.
Thank you.
Very much.
Eight B?
Yes, exactly. How'd you know?
Well, it's my life, you know.
In the shoe biz, the foot is our naked canvas. I could tell you some things.
For instance, this is a Stephanie Killa knockoff made in Jersey.
I know the family. A good quality control.
It's impetuous, fun, elegant.
Not much for cross-training.
And I hope it brings you to whatever it was you were running after just then.
Her destiny.
Find your destiny. Have you found it yet?
Excuse me. I have to go buy a book and look up every hotel in Rome.
Okay. Excuse us. I'm sorry.
-What's with your friend? Is she okay? -I don't know.
She's looking for the man of her dreams.
She's never met him. Never laid eyes on him.
You consider that all right?
But if she's never met him how does she know he's perfect for her?
Oh, I don't know. Don't know.
-He's some kind of celebrity, right? -No, no.
What is he like a hero, mentor-type thing?
No. She got his name off a ouija board when she was 11.
Okay, let's get to a phone.
-Will you be staying in Rome long? -Taxi!
I'd better come with you.
I speak a little Italian. I got a friend at the embassy. I'm gonna help you.
-This is a personal matter. -What's his name?
-It's very nice of you to offer-- -Why won't you just tell me his name?
Damon Bradley.
I'm Damon Bradley.
You're--
What?
That's a first. Got a minute?
-What were you gonna say? -I no, what were you going to say?
I don't know. I forget.
Oh, I know. Are you too cool?
-No. No. I'm perfect. -Okay.
I-- It's perfect.
-Are you? -What?
-Too cool? No? -Too cool? No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
You don't--?
Thank you.
-That was a blessing. -What?
She gave us a blessing.
An Italian gypsy blessing.
-Isn't it amazing--? -Isn't it amazing how--?
The problems you see, you're too pretty, I'm too nervous.
I can't even--
What? You're pinching me.
I want to see.
-You are here. -Yes, I'm here.
-You're here. And very real. -And very real.
God, what am I trying to think of? There's this poem by Goethe.
Yeah, Goethe.
About two people from different places but they hear the same bird singing.
Perhaps the same bird Echoed through both of us yesterday
Separate in the evening
That's it. Exactly.
Yeah.
It was Rilke.
Rilke?
Well, same country.
Right. How'd you know it?
I could tell you some things.
I love trees.
I could just do nothing for the rest of my life, just grow trees.
The ancients believed gods dwelled in them.
Did you know that?
Maybe they're watching us now.
Do you know where you are?
-No. -No?
You're at La Bocca della Verità.
-La Bocca della Verità. -The mouth of...
-Truth. -...truth.
Gregory Peck. Roman Holiday.
Legend has it--
That if you tell a lie and you put your hand in there--
It will be bitten off.
And then Audrey Hepburn says, "Oh, what a horrible idea."
And Gregory Peck says, "Let's see you do it."
Yes.
Let's see you do it.
Let's do it together.
I was born to kiss you.
Oh, there is--
Oh, God. There's--
There's-- There's something I have to tell you.
There's nothing you could tell me that'd change the way I feel about you.
I'm engaged.
We're supposed to be married...
...in nine days.
Except possibly that. Wait, wait, wait. What?
-You're--? You're what? -He's a friend of yours.
-What is--? -It's Dwayne.
-Dwayne? -That's how I knew you were here.
It was me on the phone. From the airport.
-But I thought I'd never find you. -I understand. I know, I know.
That's okay.
I've gotta--
-I've gotta call him. -No.
That's-- That's not such a good idea. Don't call him.
-I've gotta call him. -No.
-Trust me. -I gotta call him.
I gotta. I gotta. I gotta.
Are you sure?
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
Wait, wait. Oh, okay.
Want some more champagne?
Okay.
What--?
The phone.
-Can I use the phone? -No. No, no, no. Not--
Look...
...I have a confession to make too.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
-You can tell me. -Are you sure?
Yeah.
-We found each other, didn't we? -Yeah.
So this is our destiny.
So you can tell me anything.
Okay.
Okay.
It's just that--
The thing is I'm not exactly--
-Yeah? -I mean, only in the most literal sense.
I'm not Damon Bradley.
-What? -My name's not Damon Bradley.
-I just told you it was Damon. -What is it?
It's Peter Wright.
You're very upset. Natural. That's okay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
Everything else is true. I swear. I'm from Boston, single. I love trees.
I just lied about one little thing. You call your identity one little thing?
You call your identity one little thing?
Get out of my way!
You said you'd understand. Now--
That was before I knew what it was!
-Come on. -Open.
Look...
...let's calm down, okay? Let's put this in perspective. Jesus!
I can't believe you're gonna let a few letters keep us apart.
It is a detail. Just--
-Call me Damon, like a nickname. -How could you do this to me?
I'm in love with you!
What kind of an excuse is that?
Sociopaths.
They find out what you want them to be then they act that way.
Yeah. But how could he know? He only just met me.
Men have ways. That's all I know.
Here.
You know what my theory is, Faith?
Men should all get team jerseys.
And on the front, they can write "Liars."
And on the back, their name. Their real one.
Yeah.
Look at me, Faith.
I married a liar.
Why?
Because I married a man.
Here, throw these in.
So you're saying you think I should call him, huh?
-It's your husband, no? -Yes.
But he was having an affair.
No, I don't think you understand. He was sleeping with another woman.
He's having sex with another woman. Sex.
She was your best friend, eh?
-No. She wasn't my best friend. -Your sister?
No. Of course not.
His first wife?
No. No one like that. Not a friend or a relative or anything.
Just some woman I don't know. I've never met her or anything.
Hey! Marty! Wait up!
You're going over to the south side.
Don't get up until it stops raining. It should let up any minute now.
Oh, the damn phone!
Damn rain.
Larry's Roofing.
Hello.
Kate?
Kate, is that you?
Kate? Where are you?
Kate, are you all right?
Hello--
Hello. Yes. Could I get the long distance operator again--?
Forget it. Forget it.
Coming, coming, coming.
-I just want-- Is she here? -No.
-You've got to talk to her. No-- -I was on my way.
-We can work this out. Is she okay? -She's fine.
-She's fine. -She went to get our airline tickets home.
What is this? Men will say anything just to get laid?
No. Not fair. Okay? A, I didn't get laid.
B, reality is some metaphysical wires have gotten crossed somewhere.
No, I don't have the right name, but I'm the guy. I was there. I know it.
Please, do not let her go.
She's going and she's gonna marry the podiatrist.
-Podiatrist? -Yeah.
-How could you lie to her? -It was an emergency. I literally had to.
It was the only way to stop her.
-If I didn't, I'd never see her again. -A lie is a lie.
Will you please--? Please.
Please? Will you sit down for one second?
Please?
Thank you.
I am not supposed to be in Rome. I'm supposed to be in Boston...
...leading a really boring life. Working my can off for my boss...
...so he can spend half the day in the gym.
But I'm here.
And he was not supposed to get measles.
Measles at 43 years of age.
But he did. So they sent me. A guy who has never been anywhere...
...except maybe Mazatlán, you know, for spring break.
And someone gave me a little Italian phrase book before I left.
I was not supposed to be in the piazza that night. But I was.
I went to see a movie.
But in my opinion, Woody Allen is not funny...
...when dubbed in Italian. I left.
And I was just, you know, wandering. I was wandering...
...wandering and then...
...someone bumped into me.
And then I saw her.
I looked into her eyes and wow.
Something happened that's never happened to me before.
Something so familiar.
Mania?
Whatever. She fell in love with me too, by the way. Okay?
I said, "Please, God. Give me a sign... ...of making sure this woman doesn't get into that cab...
...of making sure this woman doesn't get into that cab...
...and disappear from my life forever.
She's the one.
And he did.
She told me the name-- It wasn't my name...
...but, you know, it was a start.
If that's not destiny...
...then I don't know anything.
That's really romantic.
Is it a lie?
Come on! It is a name, for Christ's sake!
This thing is so ludicrous! You know it!
She's out of her mind chasing some guy.
This guy, by the way...
...could be the biggest loser who ever walked the face of the earth.
He could be a grump, a jerk, a pervert, a cynic...
...whose mind is infested with dark thoughts. He could be a criminal.
He could be truly sick.
Realistically, like, what are the odds...
...that he's like some extra-super-double-terrific guy?
-Ten billion to one. -Exactly.
Do I have an ally?
Kate? I've returned.
Faith's friend. Peter. Giovanni, Peter, Giovanni. Hi.
Listen, I thought we could see Roma today.
-But if you are busy-- -No, Faith's friend.
-Let's go. -Oh, yes. Good.
And my husband, Larry, he's a roofer. Roofing contractor, actually.
-I mean, thank you. -Thanks.
-I mean, thank you. -Thanks. And before that, when he was younger, he painted.
Not houses, but pictures.
Yeah. But you can't raise a family on paintings.
I guess you have to be going back to work now, huh?
Oh, no. It's siesta.
You see, at home, only the kids take naps in the afternoon.
Adults go straight through.
Me, I don't even-- I don't even lie down at all during the day.
Yes. In America you care for work. You live to work. You stop for nothing.
But in Italy, we care for food, for pleasure...
...for love.
-Biscuit? -Yes.
It's crunchy.
Thank you.
I was able to get us out on the first flight tomorrow morning.
Eight a.m.
Eight a.m.?
-So soon? -Well, the sooner the better.
You were right about this whole thing from the beginning.
Stupid.
Chasing a name.
-I had to try. -What about Peter?
-Peter? -Yeah.
Well-- Peter was a mistake.
I don't know. I thought he was kind of fun, huh?
He was eccentric at best. And not in a good way.
You mean like your way?
Yeah. No-- Very funny.
-What? -You're crazy about him.
I am not.
You are too.
I hate him.
Hate? A pretty strong response...
...for someone you said you didn't even like.
I hated what he did.
Good. Because that's what I told him when he dropped off the flowers.
You--? You told him that I hated him?
Can't stand him, huh?
Hey, Katarina, la bella Italia, she's waiting.
-Let's go. -I'll be right down.
You better start packing. Our cab's coming at the crack of dawn.
He promised to take me on a tour of the fountains.
But I'll stay. I'm not gonna go. If you want me to stay, I'll stay.
He knows I'm married. I'll be back before dawn.
The 16th century exalted the human figure.
It was their way of glorifying the human spirit.
But it's an ancient preoccupation.
You see, the female body...
...has always been the essence of the mystery of human life.
So someday I'll visit you in Pittsburgh and you'll show me all her beauty?
Oh, Marcello.
I'm going to need a taxi tomorrow morning at 6:30 to go to the airport.
Okay. Thank you.
-Signorina Faith. -Yes?
Peter Wright left messages for you. He calls all the time.
Oh-- Oh, no, no, no. No phone calls for me. Thank you.
You stubbed your toe.
I know I stubbed my toe.
Well?
-Go away. -Don't you think that's a sign?
-Oh, a sign. -It's obvious. He's a foot doctor.
Your body's telling you something's wrong...
...trying to tell you not to marry Dwayne.
My toe is telling me I've been hurt by a shoe salesman.
-What about last night? -What about you're a liar?
-What about I was born to kiss you? -What about--? Just--
Don't you have to work? Maybe you're not a salesman. The truth is you came here looking for something and you found it.
The truth is you came here looking for something and you found it.
Right in the back of you.
You're frightened. That's understandable.
-Come on. I couldn't sleep last night. -Peter, stop.
Last night was an illusion.
You weren't who you said you were.
So I wasn't who I thought I was. So neither of us were there.
It wasn't real. It didn't happen.
I don't know you.
Well, get to know me.
-We're not supposed to be. -We are.
Don't throw your life away on someone you don't love.
Who says I don't love him?
All right.
Go home and marry your podiatrist.
I hope you'll be very happy together.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, okay. All right.
Faith! Faith! Yo, Faith!
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait. You can't go.
No-- Why can't I go?
Why? Because I found him.
Stop the car.
I'm okay.
Couldn't sleep last night. For some reason, I was a wreck.
So I went to that restaurant in the Galeassi. Here.
Want me to take that?
I had a chocolate gelato and I talked to the waiter.
I asked him a couple of questions. Turns out he knew-- I'll get it.
He knew the name of the guy's hotel. Of Damon's.
-You're kidding. -No, it's right.
So I call the hotel. They say, "No, he left yesterday."
But apparently, he comes here every year...
...and always follows the same route, always goes from Rome...
...down the coast to Le Sirenuse Hotel in Positano.
-Where's Positano? -It's three hours south.
-Did I do the right thing? What? -Great. We can call Giovanni.
-He can drive us. -Perfect. We can all go together.
-Did I do the right thing? -Perfect.
-I did the right thing. She won't say. -You did.
I did the right thing.
You know what I think?
Anything can happen here.
Kate, look down there.
Oh, God.
Is it over?
Where's the guy with the checkered flag?
Oh, my God. Faith, Joan Collins stayed here.
Well, right now he's by the pool.
And he says he wears a gold medallion.
-Well? -Okay. Wanna go check out the pool?
Well, let's go. This way.
Oh, look at this. Isn't this beautiful?
I hate men that wear jewelry.
That's Damon Bradley?
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Of course.
-Want me to do it? I'll do it. I-- -No.
Good luck.
Hello.
You're in my sun.
I'm sorry, I--
I thought I-- Well--
Damon!
Damon, I'll see you tomorrow. Ciao.
Ciao, Amanda.
Hello.
Damon?
Damon Bradley?
That's me.
Beautiful place.
Oh, you know, it sure is.
Yeah.
Been here long?
Since yesterday.
Yeah, I just got here too.
Well, not yesterday. Just now. Just today.
I just got here with my sister-in-law.
-My brother's wife. -Right.
Wife.
Yes.
So I'm sure I'll see you around.
Oh, I hope so.
You know...
...I was wondering....
Do you have dinner plans?
Not exactly.
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Sure.
Really?
-Ciao, Damon. -Ciao, Damon.
Ciao.
Where?
You know, this restaurant at the bottom of the steps.
It's called El Corvo de-de Sera something or other.
-Okay. -It's great.
-Okay. Okay. Corvo de something. -Eight-thirty? Sounds good?
-You got it. Good. -I'll see you at 8:30. At the bottom--
Hey.
-Watch your step there. You okay? -I'm sorry. It's okay.
-I'll see you there. I'll see you. -Okay.
Aren't you gonna tell me your name?
Oh, Faith. My name is Faith.
Smooth.
Very smooth.
Corvatch. C-O-R-V-A-T-C-H.
That's right. Yeah. My wife used her card yesterday...
...and I can't remember the amount she told me.
No. I can't wait for the statement. That's why I'm calling you.
All right. Hey, Pete!
Tell Roy to send up some more shingles!
Hey, Roy. He wants some more shingles.
Four hundred dollars?
From the Le Sirenuse Hotel in Positano?
Where's Positano, in Mexico?
Italy?
My wife's in Italy!
What the hell's she doing in Italy? She's only been gone 48 hours!
I'm sorry, ma'am. Yeah. All right, well have a nice day then.
My wife's in Italy.
What the hell is she doing in Italy?
Who's in Italy?
All right, fellas, look.
I gotta get out of here. You, you finish up this job here.
-Don't have too many beers at lunch. -Yeah, okay.
Make sure you quit by 4:00, all right?
All right, I'm fine.
Have you seen this sunset out here?
Larry would love these rooftops, you know?
Did you see his eyes?
They were beautiful. They were brown with little flecks of green.
Wasn't he nice? He's really nice.
How old do you think Giovanni is? No more than, what? Forty?
Come in.
-Ciao. -Ciao.
Katarina.
The stars will be jealous of you tonight.
You are a vision.
Thanks.
You certainly know how to talk.
Hey, hey, hey.
-Hey, ciao. -Hi.
Hey, by the way.
I invite you all on your last evening in Italy.
Friend of mine has a yacht. You can see it from the balcony.
I told him I would bring all my American friends tonight.
So you must all come.
Yeah, we'd love that. Huh, Faith? You in?
-Arrivederci. -Okay.
-Ciao. -Ciao.
Okay, have fun. Ciao.
-Ciao. -Ciao.
I'm sorry. I mean in another life, or a parallel universe...
...we would have loved that. Better?
-I have to get ready. -Okay, sorry.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Sorry.
Sorry. Here.
-What is it? -You'll see.
-Shoes! -Yeah.
They're bone. It's a good color for a date with destiny.
It should be-- And don't worry about those European sizes.
It perfect. It should fit like a glove.
-They do. -Yeah?
Good.
Could you hand me my dress? It's over on the window over--
And my earrings. Those little moon ones.
Yeah.
And could you get me my little ankle chain.
Thanks.
Oh, you got the pictures back from the...
...place.
This one of us is great. Did you see that picture that the--?
Oh, God.
-Hey. -Hey!
Oh, you look great.
Thank you.
Peter.
I just....
I wanna thank you for making all this possible.
Sure. It's the least I could do.
I mean, I just, you know, I hope you find what you're looking for.
Peter.
Stop.
Peter, stop.
I love you. No matter what happens tonight, I love you.
I have to go.
Yeah. It's pumpkin time.
Hi.
Hi.
You look-- You look just like a goddess.
You really do. I mean it's--
A lot of steps.
-Want some wine? -Yes.
Do you have a good house red?
Cool.
Now, I know you're gonna think this sounds crazy.
But I noticed you at the pool even before we spoke.
I could sense a chemistry between us.
-Really? -Truly.
So...
...you're probably wondering why I asked you to dinner.
No, not really. It happens all the time.
Right.
What looks good?
I think I'm going to have the scampi.
Oh, you like shrimp? I like shrimp.
Get out of town. Come on. Put it there.
Do you believe in destiny?
Do you believe in destiny?
It is written...
...on the stars.
There's my son, Kyle. He's in the third grade. He's really the smart one.
My other son is very physical, I guess, would be the term.
Do you think...
...I'm just one of those men who tries to seduce every woman he meets?
Oh, I know that's what you are.
Does it matter?
I've told you all about me. I want to hear about you.
All right.
What kind of books do you like?
And music do you listen to?
I like action films.
And I like Van Damme movies...
...and I love martial art films.
Really? You don't like opera?
I'm surprised to hear that.
-Oh, Giovanni, I'm sorry. -What?
You are very kind and very gentle, and I'll never forget you.
But I can't do this. I'm married.
Hey!
-That makes me uncomfortable. -Oh, I'm sorry. How about that?
-Hey, come on. Stop it. -I'm sorry, is this what you want?
-Hey, I said stop! -Okay.
-Stop it! -Hey!
-Hey. -Hey.
Peter!
Peter!
I'll kill you!
You crossed the line, you jerk! You blew it from the get-go!
I did you a favor!
I told you to turn her off, not to molest her.
I was improvising!
Are you--? Are you not Damon Bradley?
No. I am not Damon Bradley.
Look, I'm really--
Goddamn it!
I'm really sorry. You're very sweet. I'm sorry it went this far.
-Shut up, Harry! You've done enough! -You shut up!
So you're probably upset now. Let me explain.
-Let's just be a little bit rational. -Rational!
-Hit him! Go! -No, no, stop, Faith!
-Faith! Faith! Stop it! Faith! -Peter! Peter! Peter, come on with me.
Peter, come on.
Okay. What's with the bald guy?
Faith, I can explain! Great!
Slow down. Oh, God.
Oh, dear. Oh, my.
Faith, I was afraid of losing you!
Careful. Let's go.
I love you so much! You're ungrateful! Do you know what planning this took?
Hotels, reservations! This was a major production.
I did it all for us!
Oh, thank you! Thank you very much! I hope you're very happy!
I don't believe in anything!
I don't believe in the moon or the stars or the sun...
...or destiny or magic or men!
Why won't you just accept the fact that I'll do anything to keep us together?
You've outdone yourself!
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone! You're nuts about me!
-Peter. -We were made for each other!
Bravo!
Bravo! Bravo!
-Bravo! -Bravo!
Haven't they ever heard of escalators?
Faith...
...you didn't mean what you said, not believing in the stars and the moon?
You?
I....
I can't.
I can't now.
I'm sorry for dragging you here.
No, no, no. Don't say you're sorry.
Because this has been the best weekend of my entire life.
I guess sometimes life...
...just doesn't turn out the way we imagined it.
Look at the stars.
They come out every night.
To almost love a woman and then lose her.
Enjoy the pain.
It's like losing at roulette.
There's that sweet sting.
Oh, Jesus, Harry.
There's only one woman...
...and she's gone.
Are you all right?
Yes.
-Can I get you something? -No, thank you.
I just would like you to send this very quickly.
Yes.
Okay.
I'm calling off my wedding.
Oh, no.
Sorry.
-I'll send it immediately. - What?
Thanks.
-I'm sorry. -Peter.
I want to--
Come on. Let's go.
Kate!
Larry? What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What the hell are you doing here?
Oh, you came all the way here just to ask me that?
No, I--
I came all the way here to tell you I--
I love you...
...and I miss you and I--
I've been miserable without you, Katie.
Oh, Larry, I've missed you too.
So, Faith, you're gonna be okay?
I'm gonna be okay. I want you guys to have a great time.
-Did you call Mom? -Yeah.
-Did you call Dwayne? -Yeah.
-What'd they say? -Larry?
-What? -Just--
Everybody is worried about you. You understand?
-I'm all right. Thanks. -You got everything?
No. Give me a little time.
Faith.
Listen, what time is your--?
-You got your passport? -Yeah.
Ticket?
I'm Damon Bradley!
-You're Damon Bradley? -No, no.
Off the ouija board when we were kids. I made the whole thing up.
I was pushing the arrow, wanted to get to the next question.
You made the whole thing up? Damon Bradley never existed?
He existed. He was a kid I knew from Little League, a real jerk.
-What about the fortune teller? -That gypsy woman?
Don't say anything.
I slipped her two bucks. The whole thing was a joke.
This is bad. You have to tell Faith.
No. I am not gonna tell Faith. She'll never speak to me again.
-She called off her whole wedding. -Because she's in love.
Why would she call off her wedding if she was in love?
Because it's not Dwayne.
What do you mean it's not Dwayne? Then who is she in love with?
-Spanish? -How'd you know that?
It's very nice. Very nice suede. How much did you pay for them?
Eighty-seven fifty. American.
-American? -American.
I could have done better.
-Better? -Yeah. I'll give you a card.
Passengers on TWA flight to New York...

Mr. Damon Bradley, please come to the information desk.
Mr. Damon Bradley, please come to the information desk.
I'll be in touch.
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Hi. -Hello.
-I'm Damon Bradley. -Oh, yes.
-You have a message for me? -Yes, I have a message.
Mademoiselle Plantard will meet you directly at your hotel in Geneva.
Thank you very much.
Shall we?
-Damon? -Damon?
-Yes? -Hi, Damon.
-Hi. -Hi.
I'm Peter. This is Faith.
Hi.
We're a little bit strange.
She's been looking for you her whole life basically.
As a matter of fact, can I say?
She thinks that-- She wants to marry you.
Yeah.
Are you married?
-No. -Oh, good.
-Okay. You have a good job? -Of course. Now who are you?
I'm sorry. Peter, Faith. We're friends. It's okay. He's available.
This is good. See, she thinks that you two are meant to be.
-Oh, really? -Yeah, yeah.
The only problem is, I guess, me. Because I'm in love with her.
I love her more than she'll ever know.
But....
You're a lucky, lucky man.
You've got the right name.
Goodbye, Faith.
I hope you work it out.
Hope we work what out?
What's going on?
He loves me.
Well, I can see that.
I guess the question is, do you love him?
What?
I said the question is, do you love him?
What?
Do you love him?
Last call for boarding.
I do...
...Damon.
I-- I do.
Damon.
Good.
Well, I have a plane to Geneva to catch.
And you have a plane to catch.
Yeah.
Is this the flight to Boston? I have to get on that flight.
No, the flight is closed.
Excuse me? No. You don't understand.
The man that I love is on that plane.
-Are you sure? -Yes! I'm sure!
Please, can you help me? Please? You understand? Don't you?
-You got a ticket? This is to New York. -Don't let it leave. Yes.
Okay.
Oh, my God! Let's go!
Señorita!
Señorita!
Señorita!
Señorita!
-Draw your pay, Mister. -Well, you wanted him broken, didn't ya?
Yeah, but not ruined.
Now, get out of here.
Mr. Marshall.
Ever heard of a J.W. Grant?
He needs you. Urgent.
My husband.
Hurry. Hurry.
Please, hurry.
Get out of here.
Baby!
I'm Joe Grant. Thank you for coming, Mr. Ehrengard.
Got your telegram, Mr. Grant.
It's a pleasure, Mr. Sharp.
Yeah. Me too, Lizzie.
Mr. Grant, I'm your local bank representative.
As per your instructions, this box contains...
Thank you for coming, Mr. Fardan.
The receipt, Mr. Grant.
Exactly $100,000 in gold coins.
Not a coin larger than the $50 piece. That's quite an unusual request, if I may say so.
Thank you, Mr. Grant. Move out.
Mr. Grant. Slow freight ahead, Mr. Grant.
Sidetrack it. You really should count the money, Mr. Grant.
-Didn't you count it? -Well, yes, of course, but...
Thank you.
"Henry 'Rico' Fardan. Virginia Military Academy, Philippine campaign,
Cuba with Roosevelt's Rough Riders. Married a Mexican woman.
No children. Wife deceased.
Joined Pancho Villa as weapons expert and tactician."
Your hair was darker then.
My heart was lighter then.
"Left Villa's forces, June, 1915.
A year of wildcatting and gold prospecting. Results, negative.
Now demonstrating automatic weapons. Salary, $40 a week."
"Hans Ehrengard. Ex-cavalryman, cattle boss, wrangler,
bull-whacker, packmaster."
"Jacob Sharp. Specialist with rifle, rope and longbow.
Most dependable scout and tracker in the territory."
Any objections to working with a Negro?
What's the job, Mr. Grant?
How well do you know him?
-Well enough. -What's your feeling toward him?
I have the highest respect for him...
as a soldier.
Last week, your respected soldier kidnapped my wife.
His ransom note.
Your job...
A mission of mercy.
Raza. Captain Jesus Raza.
Jesus.
What a name for the bloodiest cutthroat in Mexico.
Mrs. Grant is a prisoner about 100 miles across this desert.
A hellhole. For Raza, a fortress.
He was born in that desert.
He and his men know every ravine, every rock, every barranca.
It'd take a battalion at least a month.
But a few daring men...
specialists, led by you...
could do it in one bold, swift stroke.
Why not? You're fluent in Spanish. You know the terrain.
You know Raza. How he thinks and reacts.
-I know you can do it. -I don't think so, Mr. Grant.
One thousand dollars a man going in.
If you bring her back safe and sound,
another $9000 for each of you.
-How many men does Raza have? -Pasqual?
Last month, 150, maybe. Now?
If I were you, Mr. Grant, I'd pay the ransom. There it is.
One hundred thousand dollars in gold coins, as requested by Raza.
Will that guarantee that she won't be killed anyway? You know Raza.
Say we were lucky enough to get there.
How do we get your wife out? Safely?
Gentlemen, I don't know where else to turn.
-What we really need is an equalizer. -Name it.
A dynamiter, a man with a delicate touch to blow out a candle
without putting a dent in the candle-holder. Who would that be?
Him.
-Hooper. -Yes, sir.
Arrange to have that man at the train in the morning where we pick up the horses.
-Where is he? -Not far from here.
-Get the details. -In jail.
In jail? Yeah, he says that $700 will bail him out.
But is he dependable? Can he be trusted?
I trust him.
Then you've got him.
You know, Rico, buddy... -I don't deserve you. -I agree.
I can understand you getting into a crap game and losing $700 you didn't have,
-but how'd you lose your pants? -In a lady's bedroom.
Trying to raise the cash. Almost had it made too.
You realize that people are the only animals who make love face-to-face?
He's all yours.
Thanks. Again.
You could have telegraphed the money yesterday, saved yourself a trip.
Yesterday, I didn't have the money.
What's the proposition?
You won't lose your pants.
Your life, maybe, but... what's that?
Hardly anything at all.
-Well? -Nice animals.
-Picked especially by Senor Ortega. -You can depend on them.
This one is Mrs. Grant's favorite.
Bred for speed.
He'll need a lot more than that for this job.
I'm afraid you'll have to make them do.
Mr. Grant...
I can make them go, but I can't make them do.
A hundred thousand dollars for a wife? She must be a lot of woman.
Certain women have a way of changing some boys into men...
-and some men back into boys. -That's a woman worth saving.
-Where are we going? -The Painted Mountains.
That's right.
-You want us to go back to Mexico? -This time strictly for cash.
What's the deal? Ten thousand dollars per man, for nine days' work.
More money than we ever realized
out of all our crazy silver, gold and oil schemes put together.
No detours.
I made us a contract. All the way.
-They know who took the woman? -Raza.
Our Raza? A kidnapper?
-Grant's got the ransom note to prove it. -Well, I'll be damned.
Most of us are.
Last week, Mrs. Grant went riding.
Across the border.
She was born in Mexico.
I suppose she got lonely for it.
By the time we were alarmed, the note of ransom arrived.
You'll want to know how she looks.
Those were taken four years ago on our wedding day.
I guess I'm not much good without her. Not anymore.
What part of the hacienda would they be keeping Mrs. Grant?
I'd only be guessing.
Well, that's one thing we have to know.
-What goat-keeper? -By name, Padillia. Eduardo Padillia.
He was devoted to Mrs. Grant.
Twice each day, he brought her goat's milk. It was almost a ritual.
By this, he will know you have my blessing.
Like myself, he would give his life for the senora.
When you cross under that bridge, you're in Mexico.
You'll leave as soon as it's dark.
It's safer to travel by night and rest by day.
Bring her back to me.
Please.
Yeah, I know, we've been following the same tracks for the last ten minutes.
-Mexicans. -How many horses?
Eight. More likely ten.
-How long ago? -Couple of hours.
-Which way they headed? -Same as us, south. Only, circling.
Now, why should they circle?
Raza's men?
-Why not? -This far north of the hacienda?
That's a good question.
Could be anybody. Even friendly.
Could be. Jake, shag them for awhile and Look them over.
But just look.
We'll make our first camp at the mouth of Dead Man's Canyon.
Here, you can spot us by the Painted Hills.
I'll find you.
Rico. You know something?
Me and Raza are the two most corruptible bums I know.
-We'd do most anything for money. -And have.
But not kidnapping. That's not our trade.
Why did Raza pick Grant's wife to kidnap?
Company. Eight. Next bend up ahead.
-Last night you saw tracks for ten. -That's right.
-Any cover? -Both sides.
Cut out your two horses and the dynamite mule.
Maybe they're just passing through.
Well, if so, they'll ride at us in single file.
The leader in front, and they'll palaver.
But if it's trouble, they'll come at us in a group.
But if it's trouble, they'll come at us in a group. No one in front.
Now, if the leader takes his hat off with his left hand, like this,
and passes it across him to cover his gun hand,
let go, fast.
-Bill, you take the point. -They got bolt-action rifles.
-Same setup as Durango? -Yeah. Why not?
Good morning.
-Hey, boss, you got lost? -Just looking for a place to camp.
What you got in those packs, boss? Gold?
You got more gold in your teeth.
Hey, boss, you know, it's very dangerous around here. Oh, that so?
Sure. Many banditos hide in these mountains.
Very bad hombres. They steal from anybody.
-Especially gringos. -In that case, we'd better keep moving.
Go with God.
-That makes ten. -That's right.
Shoot the horse. Shoot him!
-Bury them deep. -Nine more of their horses are still left.
You gonna shoot them too?
I guess we'll have to, we can't spare the food and water.
You can turn them loose.
-What's so funny? -People.
We just killed ten men. Nobody bats an eye,
but when it comes to one of God's most stupid animals...
But harmless.
Nothing's harmless in this desert, unless it's dead.
Want to face another pack of Raza's men? Turn them loose.
They'll head south, back to their camp.
They'll head for the water, north, to the river.
Suppose they follow us? What then?
Then shoot them.
All right. Cut them loose.
God almighty.
I've known heat before, but this is...
I hate the desert.
It's got no pity.
Jake.
-Did he take his salt? -I'll see that he gets some.
Let him sleep. You too.
How they taking it?
They'll be all right.
You'd better scout ahead tonight.
Now, beyond that ridge, 20 miles of salt flats.
Then ten more of sand. 220 degrees south by southwest.
Our next layover, Coyote Pass.
The cemetery of nameless men.
We buried some fine friends there.
And some fine enemies.
That was one hell of a fine battle.
Outnumbered, outgunned, and still we held that pass.
Yeah, but who cares now? Or even remembers?
Now, take that ruckus this morning.
A year ago, those men would've been fighting federals instead of trying to rag-pick a couple of passing gringos.
-We were lucky. -We were also stiffed.
They had us spotted back where we picked up their trail.
Why did they wait?
Why did they circle us and sucker us into this hairy spot? So you're leery about the setup too. So?
Amigo, three days' ride from Coyote Pass is another graveyard.
With one big difference.
Instead of dead heroes, they buried gold bullion.
Two million dollars in Spanish gold, melted down into big beautiful bars,
and waiting for us with open arms. And we don't have to fight Raza to get it.
That couldn't be the reason you took this job.
Can you think of a better reason?
Our word. We gave our word to bring the woman back.
My word to Grant ain't worth a plugged nickel.
You gave your word to me.
Drink?
Thanks.
Yeah, takes getting used to.
Broiling by day. Freezing up at night.
Alkali dust choking every hole in your body.
How in the name of God does anybody live here long enough to get used to it?
Men, tempered like steel, a tough breed.
Men who've learned how to endure.
-Like you and Dolworth. -Oh, no.
Men like Raza.
I wonder how long that's been there.
About an hour or so. Dolworth put it there.
A cross like that means everything's all clear.
An upside-down cross means danger.
-It could've been put there by anybody. -That's the idea.
-Dolworth? -Yeah.
-How many more? -Three.
No guns.
-We that close to Raza? -Could be.
Where are your friends, amigo?
-Hey, don't I know you? -Well, from here you look like me.
-Why you come to this place? -You'll laugh at me.
It is not proper to laugh at a man who is about to die.
I came because I'm crazy about your tequila.
And I like your women.
See? You laugh.
I'm gonna ask again. Where are your friends?
I told you. I always travel alone.
It is a sacrilege to die with a lie in your teeth.
See?
Those horses and six more come back to us.
But where are the men who ride them?
I don't think you kill ten men by yourself, buddy.
Hold it!
I wouldn't do that.
My friend would die of a terrible headache... and so would you.
And so would you.
So, wouldn't it be more sensible if we both kept our heads?
Put down your gun.
Well, now, if I did that, how do I know that you would still be friendly?
Do I gotta kill you to prove I like you?
Your gun, Mister.
Thatta boy.
You're gonna have to get over this nasty habit of always losing your pants.
-It's not dignified. -It's drafty too.
-Don't worry. This time, I'll do it. -This time, we need them.
You all right?
Makes you wonder how we ever beat the Indians.
Thanks.
Interesting pass.
It's a beaut, you should see it from upside down.
You know, if we ever hightail it out of here in a hurry, that doorway could save us a few hours.
It'd be the same shortcut for Raza.
Not if you rig it so we can slam that door in his face.
Yeah?
I'll take the first watch.
If it isn't hot, it's cold. If it isn't cold, it's raining.
How bad is that horse?
-Not too good. No bottom. -We could all do with a rest.
Yeah.
-A shave would be a relief too. -So would a bath.
Might as well throw in a woman.
Any size, any age, any color. Any woman.
Mr. D,
whatever got a loving man like you in the dynamite business?
Well, now, I'll tell you. I was born with a powerful passion to create.
I can't write, I can't paint, I can't make up a song.
-So you explode things. -Well, that's how the world was born.
Biggest damn explosion you ever saw.
Dynamite in the hands of a fool means death.
In this case, it could mean life. Ours. If we're lucky enough to get back to this rat-trap,
If we're lucky enough to get back to this rat-trap, it might be touch-and-go.
Now, all you gotta do is light this fuse.
You got ten seconds to run like hell.
And then dynamite, not faith, will move that mountain into this pass.
Peace, brother.
Well, that track is the main line to Mexico City.
According to this, Grant's railroad spur branches off about three miles up.
Beyond those hills... the hacienda.
Supply train.
-Government troops. -Well, look at here.
Raza.
-Justice. -Shut up.
The men on that train are Colorados. Expert marksmen.
Also, expert at torture.
A couple years ago, they burned and looted a town of 3000 people.
When they finished, 40 were left.
Fardan's wife was one of the lucky 40.
"Why are you a revolutionary?", they asked her.
"To rid the world of scum like you," she said.
They stripped her naked...
ran her through the cactus until her flesh was...
The other 39 rebels watched her die...
and did nothing.
Just watched.
What were Americans doing in a Mexican revolution anyway?
Maybe there's only one revolution, since the beginning.
The good guys against the bad guys.
The question is, who are the good guys?
About 60 horses, four burros.
Two machine guns from the train.
Jake.
Keep those horses quiet.
Beautiful.
-That Mrs. Grant? -That is a soldier.
Lieutenant Si Si Chiquita. Now, there's a woman worth a ransom.
She never says no.
Before you blow a gasket, think you can blow the water tower?
How do you want it?
Like it was hit with a French 75. Blow it to hell and God.
Mrs. Grant could be there.
-Seems like the only likely place. -The trouble is, we gotta be dead sure.
When we make our move, we won't have time for guessing games.
Coming through the gate.
Anybody see any cows?
No.
Well, it's a cinch that milk didn't come from the breast of a tin can.
Our friend, the goat-keeper.
Friends of Senor Ortega.
The milk that you brought to the hacienda this morning...
who was that for?
-Who drinks it? -Many people.
Anybody special?
The lady. Senora Grant.
-Does she live in that room? -Si. -You're sure? -Si.
You have seen her? I know her from the time she was born.
Her mother was dry. She was raised on the milk of my goats.
-Is she well? -Very well, considering.
We have come to help her.
Raza has to expect one of two things, a messenger with a ransom
or an attack from the federales.
We've gotta make him think that we're the Mexican army.
-The four of us? -A whole battalion.
Now, how do the federales start an attack? Artillery.
This is our battery of field guns.
First, you hit him here. French 75s. Then here, here, here, here.
Carefully avoiding Mrs. Grant.
Then when they run to defend the walls-- We slip in and rescue Little Red Riding Hood.
We can't fight our way in. Diversion is our only chance.
Well?
Rico, buddy, I got one of my feelings.
Something's dicey about this setup. Let's pull out of here.
If you can deliver this dynamite, with split-second timing...
we can pull this job off.
Mr. D?
I guess we just gotta get lucky.
Jacob, this stick of dynamite weighs exactly four ounces.
If you was to tape that to one of your arrows, how far could you shoot it?
And hit the mark.
I don't like it.
-We get it wrong? -Relax.
The stuff you're handling is safe. These beaded sticks are tricky ones.
It's the heat.
Makes them sweat. Nitro.
When they're dry and cool, they're safe and obedient.
We'll leave these sweaty ones behind.
Ventilate them. Cool them. Then maybe they'll behave.
Right now, I don't know whether it's me or the dynamite
that's doing all that sweating.
Four men against so many. How will you save the senora?
-I don't know yet. -When will it happen?
-Tomorrow. Maybe the next day. -Not before?
-There's much to prepare. -Speak plainly, senor.
Am I your prisoner?
I want to help the senora, but you make me feel unworthy.
Trouble!
Show us if you're worthy. Go greet them.
And remember, I speak your language.
They found the men we buried in the canyon.
Am I worthy?
If I were you, Jacob, I wouldn't use any of these for firewood.
Excuse me. I am ready to leave.
-Shall I tell the senora of your coming? -No.
-She might behave differently. -I understand.
By tomorrow, God willing, the senora will be safe.
Until later, then.
So you let him go.
They expect him to bring the milk.
To hell with the milk.
What more does he have to do to prove himself? He proved nothing.
He knew if he said a wrong word, he'd catch a bullet.
What were we supposed to do? Watch him all night, and all day tomorrow?
And when we go do the job, then what? We take him with us? Tie him up?
Or were you planning killing him? You know, I wouldn't put that past you.
-I don't like it. -All right.
We do the job tonight, as planned.
This fuse will burn for ten seconds. Say, three seconds for flight of arrow?
-About. -That means, once you light the fuse,
you've got seven seconds to find your target and shoot. Clear.
Start shooting as soon as the water tower blows.
These are your targets. That's your position.
-I have 4:17 a.m. -4:20 a.m.
-4:24 a.m. -Set them at 4:30 a.m.
We should have about an hour before dawn. How much time do you need?
I'll be ready by five o'clock. This fuse will burn for half-hour exactly.
-Fireworks start at 5:30 a.m. sharp. -Any questions?
-That machine gun over the lady's room? -My job. Anything else?
Let's go to work.
-See the woman? -Yes.
-Talk to her yet? -No.
-How much time we got? -About eight minutes.
That Chiquita, she can lick a whole regiment...
but she can't dance a lick.
Amigo, we've been had. Let's get the hell out of here.
-No. -No!
Do exactly as I said.
Speak only what I told you. Nothing more, nothing less.
Call them.
Rico. All clear.
By the way, I forgot to bring your wooden cross...
your upside-down cross.
They're afraid to hit the woman.
Your position is hopeless.
Put down your weapons.
Get up.
Come on, baby. Let's go.
Release the woman!
Release her!
Shoot.
Do as I say.
Shoot.
One shot from you, I'll kill her.
Get your men off that train.
Move!
Now!
-Feels like a busted rib. -Well, you're lucky.
The bullet went clean through.
Your hands are filthy.
What's it to you if he lives or dies?
If he lives, we'll have to slow down.
That'll give Raza a chance to catch up.
She'll work to keep him alive, all right.
Yes?
Just wondering.
What makes you worth a $100,000?
Go to hell.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm on my way.
Thanks.
How is he?
He will never reach the border. None of you.
You have no chance. You never did.
We knew everything.
From the moment you set foot in Mexico. Even before.
From the day my husband sent for you.
Mr. Ortega.
He said he would give his life for you.
For me, not my husband. For Raza. For the revolution.
From the loyal Ortega to the devoted goat-keeper, to the faithful wife...
at the mercy of a brutal kidnapper. That's one hell of a rigged parlay.
I was not kidnapped.
The old badger game.
Shakedown partners, bed partners.
Cozy.
Raza and I grew up together. I am born there.
When it's the hacienda of my father, when Raza is only a stable boy.
We are lovers long before Mr. Joe Grant buys the place.
When my father lies dying, he says,
"Mr. Joe Grant wants you for his wife.
You will become Dona Grant, a fine lady. That is my wish."
Here, a wish is a command.
But I'm very young and very foolish.
I tell Mr. Joe Grant I cannot marry to him.
I love another man.
Very romantic, no?
Your husband sent you these clothes.
I offer you a better bargain than I got.
Four lives. Yours, if you let me go.
You better change before we start back.
It'll be a long ride on your bare bottom.
Raza!
-How much time have we got? -None.
Get her out. Get her out!
Mario!
Drink it.
See anything?
Sand.
They'll be along.
-How would they know which way to come? -Raza will know.
You should have let me finish him.
Why didn't you kill him?
You let Raza live.
Why?
Shall I tell you?
You are simpatico. No man was more loyal to the revolution than you.
I fought like any other man.
Loyalty such as yours, that comes only from devotion to a cause.
That same fire burns in Raza.
That is why you could not see him murdered.
He is a thief, trying to steal a woman with 1000 dollars.
And you are a whore cheating on your husband.
My husband stole millions from this land, our land.
If we can keep the revolution alive, with that money, for even one more day...
then I'll steal and cheat, and whore...
and anything else that must be done.
You laugh, but you believed in the revolution once.
What else inspired you to fight for us?
Well, ma'am, I'll tell you.
I got inspired one day in May, 1911, in El Paso.
It started suddenly. Shooting, yelling, bombs going off across the Rio Grande.
Everybody ran to see what the ruckus was about. Me too.
From the top of freight cars, we could see across the river.
The Maderistas were taking Juarez. The revolution had busted wide open.
It was beautiful.
The next thing I know, I was across the border shooting along
with everybody else and yelling, "Viva Mexico."
A month later, I was blowing up trains for Villa.
Yes?
That's it.
Nothing more?
Not even money?
Promised, never paid.
But you stayed. You and this one.
And fought for six years, the worst years.
It's not our war anymore, Mrs. Grant.
Him, I understand.
An adventurer without principles.
But you?
Change your clothes.
We're leaving.
Raza says you and he were good friends.
-That's right. -And yet, you would have killed him.
That's right.
For money.
That's right.
For as much money, would you let me go?
-How long since you had a woman? -Too long.
You want me?
My price is high.
Freedom.
I might say yes now and later, no.
I trust you.
I trust you too.
You heard the man. We're leaving.
Finished.
Try a little salt, ma'am. Make you feel better.
Ma'am...
Sorry about your horse, ma'am.
-You know something, Rico? -Here.
That's a lot of woman there.
Beautiful, classy... and guts.
Hard enough to kill you, and soft enough to change you.
Reminds me of another Maria. Yours.
Amigo, don't con me.
She's going back. If I have to do it alone, she's going back.
That's just what I wanted to hear you say.
So what else is on your mind besides 100-proof women, 90-proof whiskey
and 14-carat gold?
Amigo,
you just wrote my epitaph.
-How many men? -Raza and six. Pushing hard.
Moving out.
To make the border, I feel we gotta be out in front three hours, maybe more.
We got an hour, maybe less.
You have lost.
Win or lose, here and now.
Bottleneck like this, one of us might be able to hold them off long enough.
-Yeah, one of us. -If he plays it cool.
Hit and run. Stall and retreat.
Ehrengard needs help. That's Jake's job.
The woman has to be watched, that's your job.
And buying the time we need, it's my job. Amigo, slow down.
Let's keep this thing strictly professional. Your job is to make good our contract.
To deliver the goods, all the way.
That's your job.
I got 9000 bucks coming. In hard cash, please.
You better take my horse. You'll need him if Raza gets past me.
Bill.
See you.
Jake.
How are you going to make it back?
Well, how were you?
No!
-Fierro! -I got one of them.
Francisco!
Where are they?
Speak, man. Their positions!
Rico!
Fierro, is he finished?
Not yet, baby.
Baby.
Amigo.
So you are the one they left to die?
Where did the bullet bite you?
In the ass.
You?
Another two inches, mamacita.
Could you spare one more cigarro?
Why, sure.
Come and get it.
Hey, Fierro!
-You want tobacco? -Smoking is bad for the health.
How do you come to this... to this dirty business?
The usual.
Money.
Everything is as usual.
I need guns and bullets, as usual.
The war goes badly, as usual.
Only you...
You are not as usual.
Chiquita!
Chiquita!
How's your love life?
Terrific.
You want some?
Don't you ever say no?
-Never. -Anybody?
Everybody!
You know, of course, one of us must die.
Maybe both of us.
To die for money is foolish.
To die for a woman is more foolish.
Any woman, even her.
How long you think to hold us here?
A couple of hours.
Then what happens here won't matter.
She'll be Mrs. Joe Grant again.
But that will change nothing.
She is my woman. Before, now, always.
Nothing is for always.
Except death.
Ask Fierro. Ask Francisco.
Ask those in the cemetery of nameless men.
-They died for what they believed. -The revolution?
When the shooting stops and the dead are buried...
and the politicians take over, it all adds up to one thing, a lost cause.
So...
you want perfection or nothing.
You're too romantic, compadre.
The Revolution is like a great love affair.
In the beginning, she is a goddess.
A holy cause. But every love affair has a terrible enemy.
Time.
We see her as she is.
The Revolution is not a goddess, but a whore.
She was never pure, never saintly, never perfect.
So we run away. Find another lover, another cause.
Quick, sordid affairs.
Lust, but no love.
Passion, but no compassion.
Without love...
without a cause, we are nothing.
We stay because we believe.
We leave because we are disillusioned.
We come back because we are lost.
We die because we are committed.
You and I together.
I to the front.
-I will go first. -Do as I say, woman!
A woman he will not shoot.
Jesus!
Hello, baby.
Hello, baby.
Long time since I hear "baby."
Hey, you ever find...
that damn gold mine?
I am not lucky today.
But you're beautiful.
Querido, baby.
We had some fine times together.
Terrific.
Give us a kiss.
Mrs. Grant, let's go.
Well, as long as we're not pressed for time.
Well, in a few minutes she'll be home.
Be sorta nice if Bill was here for the payoff.
Be nice if he was here alive.
But stalling around won't make it so.
A cloud of dust. Could be Mr. Raza.
Could be most anything.
Even a whirling dervish.
That, gentlemen, is the whirlingest dervish of them all.
-Never thought he'd get out alive. -And that, gentlemen...
calls for a celebration.
What's that supposed to mean?
Rico, buddy, this will come as a shock to both of us.
I'm a born sucker for love. That bullet knocked some of your brains out.
Or let some in.
What happened back there? What changed your mind?
I found out what makes a woman worth 100,000 dollars.
You expect me to turn her loose?
Turn her loose? After all we've been through together?
After all the blood it's cost? Hell, no!
You made a contract to kidnap a wife for Mr. J.W. Grant.
Now, let's collect that ransom.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.
Nicked you a bit, did they?
Help yourself.
-I'll get Mrs. Grant. -That isn't necessary.
Hooper! Escort these gentlemen into town. See they're paid in full.
Charge hotel bills, whiskey bills, girl bills, all bills. Anything they want, on me.
Well, now, gentlemen, I know how anxious you must be to get into a hot bath.
So it'll have to be adios and muchas gracias.
-A hot bath. -Why? Is it Saturday?
Just the same, you did your job and you've earned a bust-out. Now those are orders.
We have it set in our minds that the contract is not complete
until Mrs. Grant is delivered safe and sound.
-The code of the profession? -Something like that.
Very well. I hereby declare our contract satisfactorily concluded.
Not yet. Mrs. Grant...
Thank you.
Maria!
-Hooper. -Yes, sir.
Kill him.
No, no.
You haven't earned the right to kill him.
If it's not too much to ask, I want privacy.
-Joseph! -Not now.
There is nothing to hide. They know everything.
Everything.
You're back again. Nothing else matters.
I will run away again. That matters.
You're my wife. You belong to me.
I belong here.
-With him? -With him.
I'd rather see you dead. You're coming with me!
-No! -You're going home!
-No! -Yes!
Gentlemen, you heard our employer.
The lady's going home.
You don't think that J.W. Grant was stupid enough to pay that ransom, do you?
Certainly not.
There was no kidnapping.
Right, Mr. Grant?
-Is that right, Mr. Grant? -That is none of your business.
Wrong, Mr. Grant.
We made a contract to save a lady from a nasty old kidnapper...
who turns out to be you.
We both made a bad deal, Mr. Grant.
You lose a wife, and we lose 10,000 dollars apiece.
You bastard!

IT'S THE UPLINK TO THE NETWORK SATELLITE.
HE'S GOING TO FIND US.
WEISS, COME ON. WEISS.
OVER THERE.
HEY!
WHO LOVES YOU, AND WHO DO YOU LOVE?
LET ME HEAR IT.
YOU'VE GOT IT.
WHO LOVES YOU, AND WHO DO YOU LOVE?
LAUGHLIN!

RUN! GET OUT OF HERE!
LAUGHLIN, GET UP!

THE RUNNING MAN HOME GAME.
IT'S OK, IT'S OK, MAN.
DON'T WORRY, DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL MAKE SOME MONEY.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. HE'LL FIND US.
JACKPOT! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WEISS? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WEISS? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT'S THIS, WEISS? IT'S THE UPLINK INTERFACE. LOOK OUT.
GREAT! HEXAGONAL DECODE SYSTEM.
NOT IMPOSSIBLE. IT'LL JUST TAKE A LITTLE TIME.
YOUR NAME IS AMBER, RIGHT? YEAH.
AMBER, I NEED YOU TO REMEMBER THESE NUMBERS.
WE'VE GOT TO GET THEM TO MIC.
ALL RIGHT, I WILL! THEN LET'S GO!
RICHARDS, I LOVE THIS SAW.
THIS SAW IS PART OF ME. AND I'M GONNA MAKE IT PART OF YOU!
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
KEEP IT.

17, 7, 4.
17, 17, 4.
COME TO ME, MY LOVE. OH, MY GOD.

HEY, LIGHT HEAD!
HEY, CHRISTMAS TREE! RICHARDS!

GO TO COMMERCIALS. JESUS CHRIST! I HAVE NO POWER.
CUT! GO TO COMMERCIAL!
KILL HIM!
NO. I WON'T KILL A HELPLESS HUMAN BEING,
NOT EVEN SADISTIC SCUM LIKE YOU.
OH, MY GOD! BOO!
COME ON! DO IT!
WHAT HAPPENED TO BUZZSAW? HE HAD TO SPLIT.
BOO! HEY, WHAT AN INCREDIBLE BATTLE!
BUZZSAW GONE, DYNAMO DOWN,
BUT THE STALK ISN'T OVER TILL THE FAT LADY SINGS,
AND THE VERY LAST CRIMINAL...
FIREBALL, REPORT TO WARDROBE AT ONCE.
FIREBALL, YOU'RE WANTED IN WARDROBE.
AND OUR HALFTIME SHOW!
LAUGHLIN, BREAK'S OVER.
COME ON. LET'S GET GOING.
I'M GOING SOMEWHERE, BUT NOT WITH YOU.
BUZZSAW TOOK CARE OF MY... TRAVELING ARRANGEMENTS.
OH, MY GOD.
WEISS?
HE IS DEAD.
BUT HE GAVE ME THE CODE,
THE SATELLITE UPLINK CODE.
THE UNDERGROUND HAS A BROADCAST CENTER IN QUADRANT FOUR.
TAKE HER. TAKE HER AND THE CODE TO MIC.
DON'T LET US DIE FOR NOTHING.
LISTEN, WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU.
DON'T LET US DOWN.
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONLY ASSHOLE IN HEAVEN. BEN.
HE SAVED MY LIFE.
IT SHOULD BE ME DOWN THERE.
WE GOT THEM? HEY, BEN?
I GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU, PAL.
YOU GOT THE WHOLE NETWORK IN AN UPROAR.
THEY'RE SHIPPING BICARB TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN CRATES.
THIS CALL IS BETWEEN US.
IT'S NOT ON THE AIR.
LISTEN CAREFULLY, BEN.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE A THREE-YEAR CONTRACT, GUARANTEED,
A CADRE CREDIT LINE, AND A BEACH-FRONT CONDO?
SOUND IMPOSSIBLE?
BEN, THAT'S THE STANDARD DEAL FOR A NETWORK STALKER.
I KNOW REAL TALENT.
I'D HATE TO SEE YOU GET CANCELED TONIGHT
WHEN YOU COULD GO THE DISTANCE.
SAY THE WORD, BEN. YOU COULD BE DOING THE STALKING.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU COLD-BLOODED BASTARD. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK OF IT,
I'LL LIVE TO SEE YOU EAT THAT CONTRACT.
BUT LEAVE ROOM FOR MY FIST
BECAUSE I'LL RAM IT INTO YOUR STOMACH
AND BREAK YOUR GODDAMN SPINE!
DAMON, IT'S FOR YOU.
W-WHO? IT'S THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
GET OUT. EVERYBODY, OUT.
COME ON. MOVE.
YES.
FIREBALL! FIREBALL! FIREBALL! FIREBALL!
COME ON, FIREBALL.
LET'S GO!
HE'S MY HERO! HE'S MY HERO!
FIREBALL!
THERE HE GOES. FIREBALL'S ON HIS WAY.
DYNAMO'S DOWN, BUT NOT OUT. BACK TO YOU, DAMON.
BACK TO YOU, DAMON. ALL RIGHT, AGNES. LISTEN NOW. BIG CHANCE FOR YA.
WIN LOTS OF PRIZES.
WE'VE STILL GOT TWO CRACK STALKERS--
DYNAMO AND FIREBALL.
WHO WILL MAKE THE NEXT KILL?
OH, BOY. THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.
GIVE IT A TRY. WHO DO YOU THINK?
OK. I THINK THE NEXT KILL
WILL BE MADE BY... BEN RICHARDS.
BEN RICHARDS. HOLD IT. HOLD IT.
AGNES, RICHARDS IS A RUNNER. YOU'VE GOT TO PICK A STALKER.
I CAN PICK ANYONE I CHOOSE,
AND I CHOOSE... BEN RICHARDS. RICHARDS?

I DON'T KNOW WHAT LAUGHLIN WAS TALKING ABOUT. THERE'S NOTHING OUT HERE. WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT TRIP TO HAWAII.
WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THAT TRIP TO HAWAII.
I HAD THE SHIRT FOR IT, BUT YOU FUCKED IT UP.
JESUS CHRIST!
GUESS AGAIN.
COME ON, KEEP UP.
I'M RUNNING TOO FAST. MY FEET CAN'T KEEP UP!
THERE HE GOES, THE NUMBER-ONE RUSHER.
HE SMELLS BLOOD, AND NOTHING ON EARTH CAN STOP HIM.
WAIT. I DON'T WANT TO GO.
RICHARDS!
HERE. THIS WAY.
WHY? I WANT TO GO THAT WAY.
LET GO OF ME.
PUT ME DOWN.
YOU'RE GOING TO GET US KILLED.
AAH! STOP IT!

YEAH, RICHARDS!
CAPTAIN FREEDOM TO WARDROBE ON THE DOUBLE.
FORGET IT, KILLIAN. I WON'T DO IT.
IT'S NOT A REQUEST, MORON, IT'S AN ORDER.
I DON'T NEED THIS CRAP.
THIS STUFF IS...GARBAGE!
I-- I USED TO KILL GUYS LIKE THIS WITH MY HANDS.
I'M NOT USING ANY TRICKS.
THIS IS A SPORT OF DEATH AND HONOR.
CODE OF THE GLADIATORS!
SPARE ME THE COMBAT ZEN SPEECH.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON?
THIS ISN'T A GAME!
THEY'RE BETTING ON RICHARDS UP THERE!
BULLSHIT.
GET OUT OF HERE.
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!
WHAT'S THE MATTER? STEROIDS MAKE YOU DEAF?
GET HIM OUT OF HERE NOW!
NOW WHAT?
LET'S FIND MIC'S SECRET BROADCAST CENTER,
IF IT EVEN EXISTS.
OH, SHIT!
LET'S TRY THAT WAY.
WE'RE TRAPPED.
SUBZERO, FIREBALL, AND BUZZSAW.
SAY THEIR NAMES WITH REVERENT PRIDE.
THEY PUNISHED CRIME AND SERVED THE LAW.
AS PATRIOTS, THEY DIED.
I HATE THIRD-ACT PROBLEMS. ROLL... STOCK.
FREEZE IN DIGITAL MEMORY.
AND... ACTIVATE TRAVELING MATTE.
TONY, THIS BETTER WORK, OR YOU'LL BE A DIGITAL MEMORY.
TAKE IT EASY, DAMON.
WE'RE LOADING RICHARDS' IMAGE ONTO THE DATA BASE.
WHEN HE'S MAPPED ONTO THE STUNT DOUBLE,
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.
ALL RIGHT, BOYS. LET'S SEE YOU DANCE.
SENSATIONAL. I LOVE IT!
MR. RICHARDS, YOU'RE SO EASILY CAUGHT.
WELCOME TO THE PEOPLE'S NETWORK. WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.
THIS IS NICE, MIC,
BUT YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN OFF YOUR ASSES
AND HELPED US.
WE'D HAVE BEEN SEEN.
THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE FOUND US.
LAUGHLIN, WEISS WOULD HAVE DIED FOR NOTHING.
THEY DIDN'T.
I HAVE THE UPLINK CODE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'VE GOT AN UPDATE
ON TONIGHT'S INCREDIBLE ACTION.
THE RUNNERS HAVE ENTERED THE FINAL QUAD.
CAPTAIN FREEDOM HAS HUNG UP HIS ANNOUNCER'S MIKE
AND COME OUT OF RETIREMENT.
HE'S READY FOR THE FINAL CONFLICT.
LET'S GO NOW, LIVE, TO THE GAME ZONE!
YES, IT'S ALL OVER! WHAT A COLOSSAL FIGHT!
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT IN SPORTS.
CAPTAIN FREEDOM, OUT OF RETIREMENT AND UNDEFEATED--
PROVING THAT FRIGHT AND MIGHT ARE ONE AND THE SAME!
DAMN THAT KILLIAN!
WHAT'S WRONG? YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY. WE'RE OFFICIALLY DEAD.
WE CAN DO ANYTHING. NO, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY'LL NEVER LET US OUT ALIVE.
NO, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY'LL NEVER LET US OUT ALIVE. THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. THEY'LL HUNT US DOWN.
THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. THEY'LL HUNT US DOWN.
OFF CAMERA, OF COURSE.
OK. DISMANTLE ALL THE OVERLAYS.
PUT THE DIGITAL MATTE IN THE PIXEL MEMORY STORAGE.
THE DAMN THING WORKED LIKE A CHARM.
IT SHOULD. EDITEL CHARGED US AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE SOFTWARE.
DAMON! YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO KILL HIM!
IT'S PART OF LIFE, BRENDA.
YOU BETTER FUCKING GET USED TO IT.
THAT'S ONE FOR THE AWARD SHOW.
THANK YOU. YOU'RE DOING NICE WORK.
TONY, YOU'RE FINALLY GETTING IT.
GUNS? YOU DON'T NEED GUNS TO JAM A SATELLITE.
I DO, TO KEEP IT.
THE MINUTE I STEAL THE SIGNAL, THE NETWORK WILL TRY TO SHUNT
THE MINUTE I STEAL THE SIGNAL, THE NETWORK WILL TRY TO SHUNT THE NEXT ONE IN ORBIT.
STEVIE'S GROUP WILL STOP THEM.
THESE KIDS?
THIS IS A BAD MOVE, MIC.
THEY NEED A LEADER, SOMEONE WITH EXPERIENCE.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR THE DOOR.
I TOLD KILLIAN I'D BE BACK.
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE A LIAR.
LISTEN UP, EVERYBODY.
I WANT YOU ALL TO CONSIDER YOURSELVES PICKED UP FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON.
PICKED UP FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON.
ARE YOU MY PEOPLE OR AN OIL PAINTING?
WE'RE UP NINE POINTS. COME ON, NOW. LET'S GO, CHAMP.
COME ON, NOW. LET'S GO, CHAMP.
WE'RE GOING TO SEND THE UPLINK CODE IN 20 MINUTES.
10 SECONDS LATER, I'LL GO ON THE AIR.
WE'LL BE READY.
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION, FORGET THE SPEECH.
TRY THIS INSTEAD.
WHAT IS IT?
THE ORIGINAL VIDEO FROM THE BAKERSFIELD MASSACRE
BEFORE THEY EDITED FOR BROADCASTING.
WHERE DID YOU HIDE THAT?
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
HEY, WHAT THE HELL--UH!
SIX MINUTES. BEGIN SATELLITE CODING SEQUENCE.
LOAD UPLINK CODE INTO TRANSPONDER GRID.
SHUNT POWER TO MAIN CIRCUITS.
MR. SPOCK, YOU HAVE THE COM.
WHO'S MR. SPOCK?
COME ON. LET ME HEAR IT NOW.
WHOO! WHOO!
WELCOME TO THE POSTGAME WRAP-UP SHOW.
LADIES, I LOVED YOU.
THANK YOU, YOUNG MAN.
HELLO, YOU'RE ON THE AIR.
HI, DAMON. I'M WENDY. I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT DYNAMO.
IS HE SERIOUSLY HURT? HE'LL BE FINE.
HE'LL BE FINE. GOOD LUCK.
HE'S UNDER FACTORY WARRANTY.
YOU, TOO.
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.
I FEEL BAD ABOUT THE DEAD STALKERS.
MAY I MAKE A DONATION TO THEIR FAMILIES?
WHAT A DARLING.
SEND YOUR CHECKS TO THE PATRIOT'S FUND, CARE OF THIS STATION--
THREE, TWO, ONE.
THAT'S IT. WE GOT THAT BABY!
THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE.
WHO LOVES YOU, AND WHO DO YOU LOVE?
DAMON! YES! YES! YES!
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WE DON'T LIE...
LIKE OUR PREVIOUS WINNERS, WHITMAN, PRICE, AND HADDAD.
THERE THEY ARE, AT THIS VERY MOMENT,
BASKING UNDER THE MAUI SUN, THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY PAID IN FULL.
WATCH...THAT SCREEN.
YANKEE NINE-NINER. WHAT'S THE CROWD'S STATUS?
FOOD RIOT IN PROGRESS. APPROXIMATELY 1500 CIVILIANS.
NO WEAPONS EVIDENT.
PROCEED WITH PLAN ALPHA. ELIMINATE ANYTHING MOVING.
THE CROWD IS UNARMED.
THERE ARE LOTS OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
ALL THEY WANT IS FOOD!
PROCEED WITH PLAN ALPHA. ALL RIOTERS MUST BE ELIMINATED.
I WON'T FIRE AT HELPLESS PEOPLE.
WHERE'S IT COMING FROM? THE NETWORK SATELLITE.
ABORT MISSION. RETURN TO BASE.
DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL.
DETAIN RICHARDS. PROCEED AS ORDERED.
RICHARDS, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! PLEASE BEAR WITH US!
WE'RE EXPERIENCING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES!
BULLSHIT!
IT'S SHOWTIME!
GET THE PEOPLE OUT! COME ON!
THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY OUT IN THE ZONE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER NOW, BITCH?
WHY AREN'T YOU LAUGHING?
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT A DICKLESS MORON
WITH A BATTERY UP HIS ASS.
OUT! OUT!
I'LL SHOW YOU DICKLESS!
GET OUT OF THE WAY! GET DOWN! DOWN!
LET'S GO!
HELLO, CUTIE PIE.
ONE OF US IS IN DEEP TROUBLE.
SVEN, DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO MR. RICHARDS?
WELL?
I GOT TO SCORE SOME STEROIDS.
YOU LOOK PISSED, BEN.
BELIEVE ME, YOU GOT EVERY RIGHT TO BE.
BUT WILL YOU LET ME EXPLAIN?
THIS IS TELEVISION.
IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH PEOPLE. IT'S RATINGS.
FOR 50 YEARS, WE'VE TOLD THEM WHAT TO EAT,
WHAT TO DRINK, WHAT TO WEAR.
BEN, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
AMERICANS LOVE TELEVISION.
THEY WEAN THEIR KIDS ON IT.
THEY LOVE GAME SHOWS, THEY LOVE WRESTLING.
THEY LOVE SPORTS AND VIOLENCE.
SO WHAT DO WE DO?
WE GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT!
WE'RE NUMBER ONE, BEN. THAT'S ALL THAT COUNTS.
BELIEVE ME. I'VE DONE THIS FOR 30 YEARS.
I HAVEN'T BEEN IN SHOW BUSINESS AS LONG AS YOU HAVE,
BUT I'M A QUICK LEARNER.
SO I'M GIVING THE AUDIENCE WHAT I THINK THEY WANT.
WAAH! OOH!
YOU BASTARD! DROP DEAD!
I DON'T DO REQUESTS.
NO!
WELL, THAT HIT THE SPOT.
YEAH!
ALL RIGHT! YEAH!

Two of the horses run off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
You got no idea what they were after? Nope.
Offend anybody lately?
Not for five years.
Jefferson City?
No. Leavenworth.
Never been in there.
They just jumped you out of the blue?
I had to get up anyway.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business.
Four cowboys come by, and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be.
I always figure, you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is. Don't make much difference.
Got in the middle of that frying pan, and suddenly, everybody's pointing their gun but me.
Guess they admired my horse.
Guess they admired my horse. Looks like that's not all they admired.
Yep. The whole rig.
I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay.
At least they didn't kill me.
That was right considerate, I thought.
They were laughing when they left me.
Thought it was real funny.
I walked for a little while, but it was no use, so I gave it up.
Figured it was just bad luck.
Well, looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me.
Where you going?
Where's the pinto going?
I'll get these horses tended to.
I'm good for it.
Just a minute there, fella. When I'm done helping the lady, I'll come up here... I'll take this one.
This one is $20.
How much to borrow it?
The guns are for sale.
All right, what can I get for that?
Look, Ma.
This is the man, Sergeant. He claims the animal was stolen.
Yeah. How do I know this is your horse?
Can't you see this horse loves me?
I had a gal do that to me. It didn't make her my wife.
I'll tell you what. On the underside of that saddle, I got my name scratched. Take a look and you'll see.
And what would your name be? MAN: Paden.
P-A-D-E-N.
Hello, Cobb.
Hello, Paden. How you doing?
You know this man, Cobb?
I surely do.
Troopers, let's take a look at this saddle.
All right. Move along, folks. Get these children out of here,
and you... Get some clothes on.
I see you've been prospering without me.
It's been a while.
Where's the dog?
PADEN: Appreciate the loan.
I'm good for it.
Well, let's talk about that.
I'm looking for some men.
I've given that up.
So have I.
I got a legitimate job now. I could use a guy like you.
You've got a legitimate job?
You're right.
Ah, this is mighty sweet, Paden.
I think I finally found my place in the world.
Well, I'm real happy for you, Cobb,
but I think I'll just keep looking for mine.
He's getting out.
Come on, Paden. This ought to interest you.
COBB: Hey, look who's here, Tyree.
Our old riding buddy.
I... I invited Paden to join us, but he's not having any.
Where's the dog?
You owe me $13.
Thirteen. Bad luck.
I see what you like. She's mighty pretty.
Yeah, and bridle-wise too.
Except for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Black with a pretty silver band on it.
My head spent three years training it.
Sure do miss that hat.
All right, I got to be going.
Going to Turley, was it?
Yeah. Yeah, I've got to stop off there,
meet a guy, head out for Silverado.
What's Turley like?
It's a town.
Got a saloon?
I expect.
Women?
I expect.
Baxter, Hawley, where the hell you been? You're late, and I tell you, I don't like it. It's a bad start, boys.
I got my people down there throwing snowballs and raring to go.
Well, I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name ain't Baxter, he ain't Hawley.
You're not Baxter? Name's Emmett.
You're not Baxter either?
No, I'm not Hawley. God damn it. God damn it! They ain't Baxter and Hawley!
Where the hell is Baxter and Hawley? Quit your yelling, you old coot. We're right here.
HOBART: Who you calling a coot?
Calm down, Mr. Hobart.
I'm Nord Baxter. That there's my partner, Tom Hawley.
You're late. It's a bad start, boys.
Yes, sir. That means we'll just have to get you people to Silverado that much quicker. All right, let's get going.
You remember my letter, don't you, Mr. Hobart? Half now and half when we get there.
Yeah, I remember, I remember. Open the box, Eb.
Thank you. Don't you even want to count it?
Not at all, friend. We trust you.
Let's get this wagon train on its way to Silverado. You bet.
What do you want?
I haven't had a drink of whiskey or slept in a bed in 10 days.
Give me a bottle.
Hey. What are you doing, Buck?
Having a drink.
No, you're not. Get out of here.
I haven't had a drink of whiskey or slept in bed in 10 days.
You ain't getting it here.
I'm real sorry to hear that.
Doesn't look quite fair. Which way do you mean?
(ENGLISH ACCENT) What's all this, then?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
I don't like that word much, Carter. We don't serve 'em here, and you know it.
I ask him to leave, and he went crazy on us. Now, he owes me money for all this damage.
Is that a fact? Afraid not, Sheriff.
These other fellas started the ruckus. Are these your friends?
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace and it's hard on the furniture.
Now, knowing a bit about Carter here,
I'm going to let you go without paying for the damage, but go you will, and I mean now.
Is there a place in town that takes my kind?
You misunderstand. I want you out of town.
In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
That ain't right. I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now, move.
Hey, who's going to pay for this, Sheriff?
Don't press your luck, Carter.
Now, let's talk about you chaps.
We'd rather stay.
Well, we'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston.
As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts. You're kidding.
But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace.
So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business.
Have you come for the hanging?
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far, I ain't been able to find him.
SHERIFF: Well, in my town, if you're looking for someone, you ask me.
All right. He's a young fella, full of juice, about my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.
I know where that gentleman is.
Now, I want everyone to behave himself.
Emmett?
Emmett! Howdy, Jake. JAKE: Oh, I'm glad to see you.
Keep back. Thank you.
What's going on here? You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I... I think we ought to just get out of here.
I... I think we ought to just get out of here.
I mean, all I did was kiss a girl. That's why they got you in jail?
Yeah. Yeah, I kissed a girl, and... And this guy didn't like it. And so then we had some words,
so I decided to get out of there.
So I did. I... I got out of there. You know me, I don't want no trouble.
And so I walked out in the street, and this fella tries to shoot me in the back.
You had to kill him? No, I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
You're in here for winging a guy?
No. Not exactly. Because, see, then his friend opened up on me.
What friend's that? He was the one with the shotgun.
The dead one.
Jake. Jake.
I'm gonna ask you once. Was it self-defense?
Honest to God, Emmett. He would have killed me.
The jury saw it differently.
So this is the guy you're gonna hang? Tomorrow morning, 10:00.
I was afraid of that.
Emmett, can't you help me?
You know the law, Jake.
Blind Pete always said you'd hang.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right. SHERIFF: 10:00 a.m.
Oh, right. I always thought they did it at dawn.
So long, kid. I'm sorry.
I hate to see any man swing. It's bad luck.
Bad luck for me. Now I got to bust him out of there.
You have to deal me out on that.
I've had some experience with that sort of thing.
I don't want any more of it. I understand.
It's not going to be easy. It never is, but...
He's my brother. We're going to California together, but...
First, we're going to stop off at Silverado, see our sister, say goodbye.
I can't show up there with a story like this. Then I guess this is where we part ways.
Sorry.
No hard feelings.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
You ain't got any money. All right, you buy me a drink.
You know, a good, smelly saloon is my favorite place in the world.
You're wearing my hat.
What else you got that's mine?
Mister, I don't know what you're talking about.
I hope your fingers aren't tickling my ivory-handled Colt.
If you stand up real slow and let me see, you might live through this night.
Sure.
You're making a big mistake.
That's what I told 'em.
So you mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere. We sure are. We're leaving at dawn.
PADEN: I got no reason to run. It was a fair fight, and there were plenty of witnesses.
(WHISPERING) Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
(WHISPERING) Yeah, that's what happened with me too. The other guy drew first.
Right.
BOY: Sheriff! Sheriff, open up!
Sheriff Langston, come quick!
Lock the door. Don't let anybody in.
Blind Pete used to do this all by... Touch.
All right, where is he?
He left.
Like hell. This is the only way out.
I woke up and he was gone.
All right, kid, come on out. I know you're under there.
You, get over here. Yeah, you. Get over here.
Give me your hands.
JAKE: Did you get him?
(LAUGHS) Thanks for giving me a hand.
What now?
We wait. Let's go.
EMMETT: Come on, Jake, let's go!
MAN: Giddap!
MAN: Get them at the river!
(BULLET RICOCHETS) Yikes!
Here's a trick for you, kid.
MAN: Is that them shooting? No, it's coming from those rocks.
MAN: Well, let's go. He ain't hitting nothing. You idiot, he's hit everything he's aimed at.
They won't be out of our jurisdiction till they pass Blacktop.
Today my jurisdiction ends here.
Pick up my hat.
Hey, Langston! 10:00!
This a friend of yours?
PADEN: He is now.
JAKE: Who is he? Oh, a guy who got run out of town. Just like us.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
Look, Baxter and Hawley killed poor Eb and stole the money box.
They went north and we're going after 'em. Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here.
This is bad country, no place to be sitting with women and kids. Your next water ain't for three days.
We got no life in Silverado without that money. Everybody put in. That's our whole stake.
How long they been gone? HOBART: About an hour.
JAKE: I'll go with you, Mal.
Deal me in.
Jake, you know the way out of here.
I want you to get this train moving towards Silverado, and fast. I'll go with these guys.
You men, stay with your wagons and your families. Get rolling, keep your eyes peeled.
Wait a minute. Even if you do get the money, how do we know you'll come back?
Well, if we don't, you can keep my brother.
I'm trusting you, mister. CONRAD: You trusted Baxter.
I don't plan on letting these men out of my sight. You know, mister, if I brought a pretty lady like that
You know, mister, if I brought a pretty lady like that into a place like this, I'd stay close.
That's none of your business. Let's get going.
You got a point, Emmett. Maybe I'd better stay here with her.
All right, let's get turned around and get these wagons rolling!
Come on, everybody rides! Everybody rides!
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
EMMETT: Anybody got any ideas?
You really did it this time, Nord. Thank you, boss. Tom did his part, too.
Coming in!
In a minute. Should I kill him, Mr. Dawson?
I wouldn't do that, if I were you.
You're gonna need every gun when that posse gets here. Posse? What the hell are you talking about?
Me and my partner robbed a bank in Turley. Headed out with a posse on our tails.
My partner over there caught one a ways back. I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon.
You're Dawson, ain't you? Tex Larue. I used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him.
Well, Andy Simms told me there was a hideout near here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.
Mind? You brought a posse to my best hideout,
You brought a posse to my best hideout, and you ask me if I mind?
Mister, I don't know any of those names. You're about to die.
Hold on, hold on, hold on. You don't believe me, ask them two there. They saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
I seen him there, all right. I don't know nothing about any bank job.
If you took the bank in Turley, where's the money?
You know, I'd get down if I were you. They might be up there right now.
No money, huh?
It's in my saddlebags. I ain't getting out in the open to get it.
MAN: Get down!
Stop your firing until you see something! (GUNSHOTS)
If we charge them, they won't stand a chance, but first we've got to get to them horses.
Horses? What the hell are you talking about?
Cover me!
Brave man.
I think there's only a couple of guys up there, and this asshole is one of 'em.
Get that guy! Keep him from getting the horses!
That was some idea of yours. Next time, you go in. (SHOTGUN COCKS)
I knew it. Now, put that box on my horse.
Mister, you got a lot to learn about people.
They got a place south of Silverado. I guess they done okay.
Good enough, anyway, so that when my mama wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place.
That was almost nine months ago, she wrote.
The letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
Where were you? Chicago.
Working in the slaughterhouses. Chicago? You been to Chicago?
Was it wonderful? No.
Hey, Paden. Where you been?
I was just... Checking the... You know, looking in.
Jeez, Paden, her old man ain't even cold yet.
Looks pretty shallow here. We can just go off, Emmett.
Pull 'em up.
The bank's soft on the other side.
Let's go.
Well... This is it, gents. My mama told me to head through that notch.
Good luck, Mal. Yeah, maybe we'll see you around sometime.
Yeah. Maybe. So long.
JAKE: So long, Mal. Bye.
See you again, ma'am.
I think I'll ride along with the lady here.
Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado.
See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.
I'll see you around. I'll be around. Hey, Jake. Let's go.
JAKE: See you in Silverado, Paden. PADEN: I'll be there.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.
Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted.
Pretty land, isn't it? And a pretty lady.
A lot of men have told me that.
Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Believe it. They're drawn to me by that, but it never lasts.
They're drawn to me by that, but it never lasts. Why?
Because they don't like what I want.
What's that? I want to build something.
Make things grow. That takes hard work. A lifetime of it.
That's not why a man comes to a pretty woman.
After a while, I won't be so pretty... But this land will be.
Kate...
Come here.
Hi, J.T. Jake, how are you?
KATE: Come on, son.
You remember us? Yeah.
Hi, Augie.
JAKE: It's good to be home, Kate.
Daddy?
I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me.
I never thought it would be my boy. I never thought that.
Mama? She was sick a long time.
She was sick when she wrote you, but she didn't say it.
I never thought you'd come back. She did.
Where's Rae? She's gone. Gone to town.
She hated working the farm... Just like you.
What happened? They run me off.
They burned me out. Made it so I couldn't do...
Just like Georgia. You own this land.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.
Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in them hills.
Hiding out. Afraid to walk my own land.
What about the law? Whose law? The law here runs a man down just like these cattle.
The law here runs a man down just like these cattle.
That ain't right.
I had enough of what ain't right.
What we got here is a bad situation. These homesteaders you brought in with you are gonna make it worse.
When they come into this office to stake their claims, it's going to be the start of big trouble.
They're gonna cut McKendrick off in the north. You know, a man could die of thirst before anybody offered him a drink around here.
Maybe you ought to come to California with Jake and me. Yeah.
Yeah. Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land. It's just some of the people.
Problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
Problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick. J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
Emmett didn't kill anybody. Well, Kate, it was self-defense, sure enough,
but I do think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
The son is worse than the old man was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming.
He'll do anything to keep his range free.
I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
Ah, I think Jake here can take care of himself.
I just did five years I didn't owe.
McKendrick ought to be satisfied with that and let it lie.
What brings you out of your hole, Johnson?
Who's that with you, Ezra? This is my son. He's come home.
Ain't that sweet, Red?
I'm afraid you boys are trespassing on McKendrick land.
You got it all wrong, mister. This is our place. RED: What? Mr. McKendrick bought this place from your father.
That's a lie.
Tomorrow, we're going to town and straighten that out once and for all.
The next day, we'll be back here, farming, and them cattle better be gone.
If I find any cattle on our land after tomorrow,
I'm going to start carving them into steaks, and believe me, that's one thing I know about.
Killing cattle is a hanging offense in these parts.
If we shot you down right now, we'd be within our rights. Mister, you ever seen what a Henry rifle can do
Mister, you ever seen what a Henry rifle can do in the hands of somebody who knows how to use it?
Who would that be? You?
This ain't the end of it.
WOMAN: What can I do you for, stranger?
You work here? I run the place.
What can I get you? Bourbon.
Nifty. The world is what you make of it, friend.
If it doesn't fit, you make alterations. I'll drink to that.
Join me, Miss... Stella.
Paden.
Stella. Are you the midnight star herself?
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon...
Thanks. That's what I call it, too. And I know what I'm talking about.
You like a good saloon? It's the only place I'm happy.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, say, with the gambling?
See that fellow playing with his hair? That's Kelly, my so-called partner.
He runs that side. So-called?
Yeah. Apart from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
Why'd you go into business with him?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Who's the owner? Here he comes right now.
(BOTH GASP) COBB: You look fine tonight, Phoebe. (PHOEBE LAUGHS)
Well, look at this. Two of my favorite people in the world talking to each other.
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends.
Treat him right. That was my plan.
Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along just fine. You've got a lot in common. Hey, Kelly. Get over here.
You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you? (LAUGHS)
Kelly, meet my friend, Paden. Howdy.
Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house 13 bucks.
You got a place to stay? I just got into town.
Stella, we've still got that extra room out back, don't we? It's not in use at the moment.
COBB: What brings you to my saloon? Luck, I guess.
Ah, good old Paden. I was hoping maybe you'd changed your mind about the job.
I was hoping maybe you'd changed your mind about the job. You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
Oh, that ain't the half of it, friend.
(CLEARING THROAT) Welcome to heaven.
MAN: Where's the other one, Johnson?
Our orders are to run you two out of here.
You couldn't leave well enough alone, could you, old man?
If you tell us where your son is, there don't have to be any shooting.
You're lying, Hoyt, like always. Not this time. I got my orders.
My son's on the way to town. That's too bad.
You're just going to have to go by yourself.
Daddy?
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman,
but she's got a hard idea for living.
All I'm saying is you won't trip over me if you look her up.
I'm going to California with my brother.
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett.
He's a friend of mine. This is Sheriff Cobb.
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff. The pleasure's mine. Always happy to meet a friend of Paden's.
Hey, Stella, bring Kelly out here, will you?
You're... You're Kate Hollis' brother, aren't you? That's right.
Ah. You're the one that killed old Murdo McKendrick.
I didn't have much choice. He was about to shoot my brother in the back.
Can't be having that, now, can we?
KELLY: You want to see me? Kelly, we're going to make an adjustment.
I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy.
Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
What are you talking about? I'm done talking, Kelly. Get out.
You can't do this. Really?
How about it, Paden? You want the job? I see you're an understanding boss.
Well, nothing like that would ever happen between us.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
You'd be welcome.
No, Kelly! He'll kill you!
COBB: Stella.
Thanks for warning me.
(CLEARING THROAT) Didn't have much choice.
COBB: All right, stand back.
I never enjoy killing a man.
Excuse me. Sheriff, I'm a gambler who'd like to run an honest game here in your town.
To whom do I speak about that? I hope it's not this gentleman.
That's him.
I better find somebody to clean up this mess.
You used to ride with that guy?
(GRUNTS) JAKE: What are you doing?
I told you to practice on horses not moving, huh?
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Well, where you going? Well, I got things to do, kid. I'm a busy man.
I'll go with ya.
A grown man can't have a little boy with him everywhere he goes, you know?
Well, who's a grown man?
MAL: Hello, Rae.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were done with our family. Daddy's dead.
He was murdered.
Who did it?
I'm not sure, but I've got an idea, and when I'm sure, they're gonna pay.
Oh, that's just fine. Where were you when Mama and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal.
Now you finally show up, and all you can think is to get yourself killed.
You okay, Rae? Yeah, I'm okay.
Will you introduce me to your friend? He's not my friend. He used to be my brother.
Calvin Stanhope. But my mother called me Slick.
Excuse me.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you. That's none of your business.
Rae, all we got is each other.
I don't have any family anymore.
I'm surprised to see you out here today.
I just come out to say goodbye. Goodbye?
Yeah. Jake and me will be heading out for California soon.
You came all the way out here just to tell me you're going to California?
All you had to do was go and we'd never see each other again.
That's why I'm here. Why?
You don't make it easy on a fella.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
Yeah. That must have been it.
WOMAN: It's McKendrick's men! (WOMEN SCREAMING)
All right, let's go!
God damn it! We won't quit, you bastards!
PADEN: Is that a fair mix? I'm saving lives here.
The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
I meant, it seemed like a lot of whiskey.
What's this? That's the good stuff.
Oh, yeah? How good?
Here's to the good stuff. May it last a long time.
You'd better get out here.
Nothing happened, Tyree. This is my job. Shut up.
I don't believe a lady has to explain anything to a man this ugly.
What's the trouble here? Stay out of this, Paden.
He can't do that, Tyree. Cobb's hired him. That's Cobb's mistake.
Come on out of there, Phoebe. You've done enough.
Go on home, Jake. All I did was kiss the girl.
That's what you said in Turley. Remember how that ended?
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I don't want you getting anybody in my place.
I should have killed you a long time ago.
Why not now?
Don't do it, Tyree. I just lost a partner. If you kill him, I'll never get anyone to work in here.
You'd better start looking.
You really are a gambler, aren't you?
Give me some of the good stuff.
Whoa! Hold it!
Sorry about that. Hey!
Where'd you get this horse, kid? This is my uncle's horse.
Like hell it is.
What's the problem, Swann?
Yeah.
What's the problem?
Emmett. McKendrick.
I didn't know you were out. Seem short to you?
That's all over with, as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
Sounds good. All right, then. Let's go.
Mr. McKendrick. Don't you recognize this pinto? What?
That's Lee's horse.
Shut up, Swann. Wait a minute.
Get down from there, Augie.
EMMETT: The man who lost this horse must have been working for you.
I should have known.
But you changed your brand, Ethan. A lot of things changed when my father died.
He must be pretty good. He's good, all right. Too good for my men.
That's why you've got to take care of it. What about his brother?
We'll handle that. He's careless.
Things are getting messy around here.
I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
I heard that, too. Did you hear his son is still around?
Cobb, looks like you're finally gonna earn your money.
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care about money. (LAUGHING)
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's gonna be.
Sheriff. Howdy, Mr. Slick. Let me tell you about your friend Paden.
Me and him and Tyree, and a few others, we did a good bit of riding together a few years back.
Business, you know, and business was pretty good.
We were moving around a lot, the way you have to in that line of work.
And somewhere along the line, we picked up this dog, and one of the boys took to feeding it,
and one of the boys took to feeding it, so it followed us everywhere.
Anyway, this one time, we were leaving a little Missouri town in quite a hurry, bunch of the locals hot on our tail,
and this dog somehow got tangled up with Tyree's horse.
Tyree went flying.
Tyree was pretty mad when he jumped up,
and being Tyree, he shot the dog. Didn't kill him, though.
And before you know it, Paden is off his horse, and he's holding this dog.
He'd gone all strange on us. Said we should go on without him. Hell, I thought he was kidding at first, but he wasn't.
Tyree was ready to plug them both. All this with a posse coming down on us.
I thought we were pals after all that riding we'd done together.
All of a sudden, he was more worried about some mutt.
Well, we did like he asked, and we left him,
and he went to jail for a dog.
You want to hear the funny part? Paden didn't even like that damn dog.
It evened out in the end. They locked me up, but the dog sprung me.
They locked me up, but the dog sprung me.
Where's the dog now? He left me.
Come on, Paden. I'll buy you a drink.
I took out $13. (SNICKERS)
This is a lot of money. I told you this was a sweet setup.
It is that. Maybe you could run it without Stella.
This is her life. I'll go before she does.
Easy, boy. It was just an idea. Well, thanks, but forget it.
You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job.
what makes all this work is me doing my job.
Those fellas you come to town with, they're causing some trouble.
It's going to take some straightening out. I have my responsibilities.
I just want you to understand it has nothing to do with us.
What is it you want from me? Nothing.
Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing. We understand each other.
Don't worry about me.
If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
You're empty, mister.
Ain't you dead yet, mister? Cobb said he'd be hard to kill.
I guess you couldn't hear us coming. He was practicing so hard for a fight,
he missed the whole thing. So long, stranger.
Now, I don't want to kill you, and you don't want to be dead.
He can't be that good, Tyree. You want to find out?
I think we should do like he says.
How you feeling? I'd be a lot worse you hadn't come along.
Well, I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.
Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town and he told me about that business the other day.
Said you boys took a Henry rifle off of one of McKendrick's men.
off of one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it. That's it.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I'm sorry.
I've got to get to my brother. They'd come after me, they'll want him, too.
MAL: You'll never make it. I got to. (GROANS)
I'll go.
I'll bring Jake out here.
You be careful.
You're in it now. It's going to get mean.
Augie, I've had enough of this. Kiss your father and get in bed.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about. Rae, I need help.
So why come to me? Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.
The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I've got to talk to him. And what's stopping you?
They're watching the Hollis' place. I can't get through.
What makes you think I could?
Why would they stop you? 'Cause I'm your sister.
He ain't in the saloon neither.
Where is that boy?
WOMAN: You're crazy.
Why him? You need help, don't you?
Jake said he'd meet you behind the church. Be careful. They're all over the place.
Thanks. Good luck.
Well, you must be Ezra Johnson's boy.
Now, don't shoot the Sheriff. That's against the law.
So is killing a deputy.
Now, we're gonna give you a fair trial...
...followed by a first-class hanging.
Or you could ride out of here before dawn.
All you've got to do is tell me where I can find your friend Emmett.
Why are they doing this, Mal? Because they enjoy it.
What happened to Emmett? Cobb's men just about killed him. That's what happened.
I got there just short of too late. Lucky.
Yeah. It's working out real good.
Where's Emmett now? You're working for Cobb these days, aren't you?
Your friends have been beating me to find that out. You think I'm just going to tell you?
You waltzed in here pretty easy. You can go out the same way.
Me, they're figuring to carry out.
Is he all right? Looks bad, Rae.
He's a hard man,
He's a hard man, and he won't give them what they want. It's gonna cost him.
Well, can't you stop 'em? I don't think so.
PHOEBE: Rae.
What is it?
Oh, Kate. Sweet Kate.
MAN: Don't.
Well, Jake's been with me all evening. I just left him.
Where is he now? Went home.
Been with you all evening? Even after Slick came to get him?
Slick didn't come.
KATE: No!
Stop it! He saw us.
Bring him with us.
MAN: Fire! The land office is on fire!
Help J.T. Where's Augie? Her boy must be upstairs.
No. No. They took him. They took my Augie. (ALARM BELL RINGING)
STELLA: Lafferty, you go around the back of the house. Wyoming, you go over there and help out.
Tom, you go help with the buckets, too. Nathan, help with that wagon.
Give it up.
I hate to see this kind of thing in my town.
I'm going to have to look into this. Yeah, maybe I will, too.
Yeah, maybe I will, too. I thought we talked about that.
We didn't talk about this.
They took the little boy, Cobb.
You're still worried about the dog, aren't you?
You've got to calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
Yeah, I saw how you put Mal Johnson straight.
Never could count on you to be reasonable.
Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
Cobb, you got nothing I need.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
What's she got to do with this? Not a thing.
She's just a mutual friend.
But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
I'm trying to save you from yourself.
Don't change your luck.
(STELLA SIGHING) STELLA: What is it that I can't figure? What do you mean?
What do you mean? Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
What makes you say that? If he didn't, you would never sit still with all this going on.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
No. What's he got?
Cobb says there's no telling what you're gonna care about.
Is that what he said?
Well, he figured it okay this time.
Look who's here, Johnson. Your sweet little sister.
Maybe I'd better search her. Won't be easy, you know.
I only got one good hand.
Rae.
Garth. You in there, Garth?
To my midnight star.
Cobb's using me to stop you,
so good people are being hurt because of me.
That makes me mad.
Some people think because they're stronger or meaner, they can push you around.
I've seen a lot of that,
but it's only true if you let it be.
The world is what you make of it.
I like your attitude, but it can be risky.
I'm ready for that.
What about you?
(SIGHS) I don't want you to get hurt.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
Stella, come quick.
She sprung her brother all by herself, and this is what happened.
He brought her here. Where'd he go?
I told him about Jake and the little boy. He went off after Emmett.
Stop your crying. Go get Doc Skinner and bring him to the shed.
Pick her up. I've got a place to hide her.
You'd better get in there with her until this thing is over.
Where's Jake? McKendrick's men got him.
Is he alive? It's worse than that, Emmett.
They took him at your sister's house. Her husband was shot. I don't know if he's going to make it.
Kate? She was hurt... Pretty bad.
Emmett... They took the little boy with them.
Put on one of these. This ought to do.
Garth? Fox!
(SIGHS) Get Kyle and Dusty over here, and keep your eyes open.
We're running out of deputies.
Stampede!
(MEN CLAMORING)
Augie, where's Jake? He's dead.
What?
He was trying to get away
and he fell off his horse, off a cliff.
Jake fell off his horse?
It's all right.
Yeah. Where's Emmett? He's inside.
Where have you been? Playing dead.
Let's get out of here. Right.
Mal!
EMMETT: Jake! AUGIE: Uncle Jake!
Hi, guys!
Come on, Augie.
Come on, Augie, jump.
Come on!
You on?
(BOTH URGING HORSE) JAKE: He's on the roof, Paden.
It never should've got this far, Cobb. This is as far as it's going.
Well, I'll do my part, but you better watch your ass.
These guys will shoot it off.
I'm going to enjoy this.
This used to be a peaceful town.
What's going on, Sheriff?
Hide and watch.
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)
MAN: Get off the street.
Any sign of Stella?
Been looking. Now, see if you can find Rae. Yeah.
You wait till we get back. Don't come in.
See you around.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
You're on. Let's get 'em!
Hey, Paden. Good luck.
(SHIVERING) I'm going for the doctor. You're going to be all right.
Don't be afraid, babe. I'll stay with you until your little friend comes back. (WINCES)
Come on out, boys! Jake's in town! Let's start the ball!
Mal.
I'm glad you're here. I've been watching her, but she needs a doctor.
Yeah.
Looking for this?
It's all right. I'm here now.
What a waste. This could've been such a sweet deal for us.
Yeah. Bad luck.
Goodbye, Cobb. Goodbye, Paden.
To California. ALL: To California.
Got to go. Right.
You take care of yourself, you hear? You too.
Jake. Paden.
Come on, Molly.
RAE: Bye-bye. Bye.
Bye. Bye.
Weren't you gonna come out and say goodbye? I already did that.
You know where I'll be. Yeah.
So long, Paden. So long, Jake.
Well, you might make a farmer yet. I got a job.
Let's get going.
-Miss Flores. -Professor Cale.
Come on in. When did you get in?
A couple of days ago. I've been talking to some guides...
...hoping they might know the whereabouts of our tribe.
Any luck?
There's sufficient evidence to suspect that these people are out there...
...and can be found and studied.
At least, that's what I told the grant people.
My man seems to think the tribe was around here... ...between these tributaries. He'd found one of their markers.
...between these tributaries. He'd found one of their markers.
-Well, that's good. -Yep, I think we may have a chance.
You get me there and I'll shoot it.
I'm counting on that. That's why I hired you.
And I'm glad you did. I really appreciate it. Well, I wanted the best director I could get.
Well, I wanted the best director I could get.
I think we'll make a good team.
You're a mess. What happened to you?
Oh, just a small attack of piranha. Barely escaped with my life.
Somebody's up awfully early.
Yeah, well, today's a good day.
-Is that right? -Oh, yeah.
Not every day my homegirl from SC get to direct her own documentary.
You ready?
-I think so. -That's right.
-Congratulations. -Thanks.
Mateo?
I see you made this a pleasure cruise.
Come on, you know me.
I don't mix business with pleasure.
Okay, well, what about if we go up through here?
This way better. If not, I cannot be responsible.
Okay, well, it's only 55 kilometers out of the way.
Shouldn't be a problem. Better safe than sorry.
-Morning. -Morning.
-Mateo, you understand me? -Sure, I understand.
I'm gonna need you to drift through that channel. I wanna get some shots.
As you say, chefe.
-For your approval. -Thanks.
So where's Westridge? I know he checked in.
He's probably just catching up on his beauty sleep.
Careful!
Careful! Bordeaux. Fragile. Expensive wine.
Christ!
-Morning. -Morning. How was your flight?
Actually, it was a bloody nightmare. Ongoing, I think.
One zoom lens.
You. Stow this in my room, will you?
Excuse me? I'm not the bellhop, I'm the production manager.
Then surely you can manage my things into my room.
One pompous ass.
In some cultures, that's a sign of respect...
...when somebody asks you to carry their bags.
-Respect this, sound man. -It's not me who said that.
-Mr. Westridge, Terri Flores. -Terri, this is a pleasure.
Professor Cale lent me some of your films.
I thought they were very promising.
-God, it's hot. Are we on the equator? -Well, thanks.
Welcome aboard, I guess.
-I think he likes you. -Oh, you felt that too?
Damn, Cale, you look like a little low-budget-ass Jacques Cousteau.
Yeah, well, whatever the hell that means.
It's good to see you, man.
Chefe, ready for Rio Negro.
All right. Double-check your gear, make sure it's all onboard...
...and pray you didn't forget your bug spray.
Our adventure begins 1000 miles from the mouth of the mighty Amazon...
...deep in the heart of the rain forest.
From here, we will travel by river barge...
...up through shallow tributaries and unexplored backwaters...
...in search of the elusive people of the mist: The Shirishama tribe.
One of the last great mysteries of the rain forest.
Is it just me or does the jungle make you really, really horny?
Oh, no. I think it's the jungle.
I'm serious. I've got, like, one thing on my mind.
Can I work, please?
Help!
Save me! I'm stranded.
My boat is stranded in the roots.
Help me!
Help me! Hello!
Check it out, there's a dude on a boat over there.
Hey! Pull over to his boat.
Stop.
We'll bring you onboard.
Here.
Thank the Lord for you. Thank the Lord.
You hurt?
Are you okay?
My propeller tore off in the roots.
We can't take you back to Manaus. We're headed upriver.
At the next village, I know the people. They help me fix my boat.
-I sorry if I be trouble for you. -There's no need to apologize.
We're all at the mercy of our machines.
Yours broke.
Mateo?
Fish, river-style.
Not bad.
We're gonna have to get that on film next time.
-Ever work in a sushi bar, Mr....? -Serone. Paul Serone.
Where you from, Mr. Serone?
-Paraguay. -Really?
I started out studying for the priesthood...
...but then I needed to see the real world.
So I ended up in the jungle.
I seem to fit.
Tell me, what does a failed priest do in the jungle?
Fail?
Who says I fail?
I didn't fail.
-I'm sure you didn't. -Well, what is your calling now?
-Snakes. -Snakes?
I catch them.
For zoos and collectors. Whatever they want.
Poaching?
Poaching is illegal. May I ask what you are hunting?
We are not hunting or trapping anything.
We're making a documentary on the Shirishama Indians.
-The people of the mist? -That's right. You've heard of them?
I've seen them.
Really? You think you could show me where that was?
You people saved my life. This I can do.
I can show you exactly where I saw the Shirishama.
So slurs every other river rat after five whiskies in any bar in Manaus.
Come on, lovey.
Five whiskies?
That's breakfast on the river.
Well, does salad go well with fish river-style, Mr. Serone?
Salad would be perfect...
...little baby bird.
Okay.
Look at that.
What are those, fireflies?
It's pretty, huh?
Family Lampyridae.
On certain nights they all gather in the same tree...
...and use their night flashes to announce their readiness to mate.
Well, whose flashes, the males or the females?
Both, actually.
The females with a series of short, dainty feminine little flashes...
...about eight per second.
The males respond with a series of long, drawn-out manly flashes.
I like that.
No pick-up lines, no misunderstandings.
Just instinct and nature.
I missed you.
Shit.
Bloody racket.
Hey, hey, hey! Don't touch my radio.
You know, I could cheerfully hire someone to kill you.
A local tribesman, perhaps. Fifteen dollars should cover it.
-I could just kill you for free right now. -Oh, yeah?
-You and whose army? -Your mama's.
So are we getting close?
Just around this bend.
Perfect.
A snake totem.
This totem is Shirishama.
Shirishama worship giant snakes, anacondas...
...as gods, protectors.
There's a legend they pass down of a journey to a sacred lake.
First you must pass a waterfall protected by warrior snakes.
Once you pass those guardians...
...you travel through the land of the Shirishama...
...until you come to a wall so high, it blots out the sky--
Follow that wall for five days, finally reaching its end...
...the head of a giant anaconda.
-You know the story. -Of course.
Beautiful, beautiful legend.
I believe, however, it's a legend of the Maku.
Also the Shirishama.
Not to my knowledge.
The water is high now, but the village was right here.
You'll find them down this fork. I know, I trap snakes for a living.
And I'm sure you're very good at it.
I locate tribes for a living and I'm very good at that.
The water level is high, which by my calculations means...
...the areas to this side will be flooded...
...which would force our tribe, if they wanted to eat...
...to seek out higher ground. So over here.
Which way?
We'll go this way.
Westridge, I wanna get a shot of you with the totem.
And, Gary, you're gonna roll sound.
-Camera rolling. -Action.
Our first piece of luck: a Shirishama idol...
...although this is the subject of some dispute.
I know what I know. You can accept it or reject it.
-Leave me at the next village. -Cut.
With pleasure.
What the hell was that all about?
We're gonna go out and get some wild sound.
Well, just be careful.
We will.
See you guys.
All right.
Gary....
It's unbelievable.
-Gary? -What?
Oh, my God.
No, wait.
Do you hear that?
The silence.
Run, Gary!
-What was that? -I don't know.
Mateo, shine the light over there.
These two are fortunate to be alive.
-What happened? -You guys okay?
Man, you should have seen it. What a shot.
This guy just blasted this thing coming right at us.
Wild boar.
Gores with his tusks. Goes for the eyes.
-Denise, are you okay? -Yeah, thanks.
From now on, everybody stays onboard at night, all right?
-No exceptions. -That's a smart idea.
Mateo, let's cut him up. Food for a week.
Food?
-My turn? -No, it's my turn.
-No, it isn't. -Yeah, it is.
Mateo, do you have control of this vessel?
Lie, if you must.
Mateo.
Goddamn rope's caught in the propeller.
Well, looks like I'm gonna have to cut us loose.
It's maybe better I do it. This river can kill you in 1000 ways.
I can handle it. The only thing I'm really afraid of...
-Okay. -...is the candiru acu.
"Can do" what?
Candiru acu. It's a tiny little catfish.
It swims up into your urethra, finds a nice warm spot...
...spreads its thorny little spines and refuses to budge.
You have to cut it out.
That's it, man. I'm getting the hell back to L.A.
Terri, something's wrong!
Oh, my God. Cale?
-He's hurt. I'm going. -Hold up, hold on. Hold it, I got it.
Gary.
Hurry up.
Come on, guys. Come on.
Steven? Oh, my God.
Is he breathing?
Faster, come on. Is he all right? Is he okay?
-Hurry. -Oh, my God.
-Dan, be careful. -What is it?
-It's okay. -What is it?
Take his mask off. Be careful, be careful.
-Get something for his head. -Okay.
-He's not breathing. -Move him.
He's not breathing.
-Something for his head. -Here.
There's something in the mouth.
Oh, dear God.
Oh, damn. What's that?
Oh, God.
A wasp.
Deadly.
Poisonous.
Well, he's still not breathing. What are we gonna do?
-Oh, God. How did this happen? -Alcohol.
I've got whiskey in my flask.
-Quickly. -What's that for? What are you---?
-He's breathing. He's breathing. -That's it. He's gonna be all right.
Here.
He seems okay. We should go now.
Man, that radio don't work. We have no communication.
Hey, I can't fix, okay?
-We can start now. -No, no, no.
Fog.
We don't get this man to a hospital soon...
...we might as well throw him in the river.
What?
Terri, we got lights.
Good. Mateo, we're just gonna double back.
Fighting the current, lose two days.
Cut back to this tributary, save us 50 miles.
This is the route you suggested we take yesterday.
Yesterday for a different reason.
Now our concern is getting Professor Cale to a hospital...
Now our concern is getting Professor Cale to a hospital... ...as fast as possible.
Fine.
I hope you know what you're doing...
...because I don't know about this dude.
What choice do I have?
What the hell is this?
Hey, Terri, come here.
This is the river you know?
No, this is new.
But no cause for panic.
I'm not panicking, I'm just looking at this wall...
I'm not panicking, I'm just looking at this wall... ...that's blocking our way down this river that you know.
Well, let's just see what we can do.
Hey, is that real dynamite?
-It's always good to be prepared. -Prepared for what?
Well, you gotta be kidding me. That thing must be there for a reason.
Yeah, to keep us out.
I'm talking about upsetting the ecological balance of this river.
Well, look, I can blow it in 10 minutes...
...or if you feeling sensitive, we can turn around and lose two days.
It's up to you.
Terri?
Oh, for God's sake, blow the bloody thing.
Just give me 10 minutes, people. Ten minutes.
I'm gonna need some help. Gary, get the little boat.
-There's something down there. -That's right.
-No, I really mean it. -I really mean it too.
Hurry!
Shit.
Goddamn it. These snakes.
Oh, God.
Babies. All of them babies.
Well, how do we get them off the boat?
Come on, babies. Come on, back to your mama. Come on.
Come on.
Some of these aren't babies.
Mateo, there's more right here.
Calm.
-You little shit. -Serone, help him get it off.
Someone get this bloody thing off my freaking hand!
Get it off!
So young and yet so lethal.
Get it off me. Come on.
Later, sweetie.
You knew there were snakes here, didn't you, Serone?
It was a pleasant surprise.
What about the fuel?
There's only one drum left.
That's enough for about 100 kilometers.
About a day's ride. Well, that will have to do.
Go, go. Back to your mother.
Hey.
Hi.
How's he doing?
-He's breathing normally now. -That's good.
We'll get him home.
I just don't know what's going on, you know?
Serone's supposed to help us get back to the hospital, right?
And he acts like he owns this river.
And we run into a barrier full of snakes.
I mean, where is he taking us?
Mateo. Mateo! Stop the boat.
-Stop it. -Why are we stopping now?
Could be fuel.
You know that boat?
There's lots of boats like that.
Hello?
I get the distinct impression there's nobody home.
Mateo?
Come with me.
Hold up.
I'm gonna get this on film.
-You don't need sound, do you? -No, I'm not gonna go over there.
Go aft.
Serone?
-Kind of spooky in here. -You think so?
What the...?
Goddamn.
-Help me with this. -What's that?
Treasures.
Here.
Hey, be careful. I put my camera in here.
Mateo, that's it. Let's go.
Hey, I'm coming. I'm coming.
-What's all this? -And what about the fuel?
There wasn't no fuel.
-Great. -Where's Mateo?
I don't know. He was right behind us.
Mateo!
-I'm going back. -Serone, go with him.
Maybe some other time.
Asshole.
Stuck in the middle of nowhere and now we've lost the driver.
Mateo.
Come on, man. Stop playing.
Danny?
Danny!
Danny?
-Yeah. -You okay?
I'm all right.
I didn't see him.
How very reassuring.
Here, this is it.
-This is all you found? -Yeah.
-What the hell is this? -Anaconda skin.
-There's snakes out there this big? -This skin is three or four years old.
Whatever's shed it has grown since then.
But something like this has made a meal of our dear captain.
What?
-Snakes don't eat people. -Oh, they don't?
Anacondas are a perfect killing machine.
They have heat sensors.
A warm body like Mateo's in the water wasn't hard to find.
They strike, wrap around you, hold you tighter than your true love.
And you get the privilege of hearing your bones break...
...before the power of the embrace causes your veins to explode.
-No, Mateo's probably just lost. -Oh, wake up.
Imagine something this big, captured alive.
That's worth a lot of money, Gary.
Jesus.
Please, people...
...don't make me out a monster.
I didn't eat the captain Mateo.
Come on, everybody.
We are not sure that Mateo is dead.
-So we'll just wait here till morning. -Are you insane?
Where do you think he went, a walk in the woods?
We've got to get the hell out of here.
-Oh, get a grip, Westridge. -I've got a grip.
If it was you out there, you'd want us to stay too.
Listen, if it was me out there, I'd be dead, don't you see?
Just go into your cabin and lock the door.
Like a bad boy. All right. All right.
Where are my shoes? Where are my shoes?
-We're gonna aim lights at the boat. -That's a good idea.
Lights are a good idea.
I'm not so sure he didn't eat the captain.
He sure looks satiated.
Think he's still alive?
-No. Let's go to bed. -Okay.
Danger.
Danger is exciting, huh, Gary?
You go to bed, I'm gonna catch up to you.
-Gary, come on. -I'm just gonna talk to him a second.
-Well, hurry up, I'm scared. -I'll be right there.
-So it's out there, isn't it? -Yeah.
-You know how to catch these things? -That's right.
But you can't catch an anaconda by yourself.
You need a partner.
Capture alive...
...maybe a million dollars, Gary.
Still no Mateo.
Keep it steady, Westridge.
Steady it.
Man, what the fuck are you doing?
You can't catch anacondas without bait.
Oh, my God.
-Westridge, let's go. -No, Westridge. Stop. Not on my boat.
Your boat? You speak for everybody?
Gary? She speak for everybody?
Gary?
Well, I mean, the way I figure it, with Cale messed up, the movie's off.
Well, I mean, the way I figure it, with Cale messed up, the movie's off. Why not salvage something?
You know, let's film Serone capturing a big snake.
-Have you lost your mind? -Have I lost my mind?
No, I haven't. If anything, I'm completely lucid right now.
It's you guys who need to open up your eyes.
Yo, hold up.
How we go from taking Cale to the hospital... -...to catching a goddamn snake? -Do you know where you are?
-...to catching a goddamn snake? -Do you know where you are?
You're in the middle of the jungle.
Okay, all you guys do is you question and you criticize...
...but remember, you don't know shit about the shit we're in.
And neither do I, okay?
But I guarantee you I know who does: this guy.
Paul has been here.
And if we help him catch the snake...
...then he will help us get out of here alive.
And that, amigos, is not insanity. That is common freaking sense.
Come on, Gary, this-- This isn't you.
-Honey, what did he do to you? -Stop, okay?
Think about how much money this will be worth.
Imagine capturing something like this on film for the first time ever.
-What else are we supposed to do? -I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm about to throw both of you son of bitches in the river myself.
-I don't think so. -I didn't want this to happen, people.
-Let's go, Westridge. -Okay.
Gary.
Occupy yourselves. Play some cards.
Nobody move.
Gary! Gary, get the lights.
Westridge, stop the boat. Stop it.
-Get it over here, Westridge. -You're gonna get us all killed.
That's it, that's it.
Go for the eyes.
-Go for the eyes. Blind it. -Oh, man.
He's fishing for snakes. The man gotta be crazy.
Just let it go.
Westridge, come here. Come down here.
Danny!
Westridge.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Don't move. I'll get it with the tranquillizer.
Denise, get up here. Get up here.
Gary, help me.
-Get out of there. -Grab her, man.
-Get out of there. -Grab her, man. I'm stuck.
Grab her hand.
The snake, it's in the water!
Let's go!
-Gary! -I got you.
Gary, give me your hand.
Gary!
-Gary! -No!
It's no good to me dead.
Gary!
Oh, God!
Gary!
May the souls of the faithful departed...
...through the mercy of God rest in peace. Amen.
-Westridge. -How dare you?
It was you who brought that snake.
You brought the devil.
There's the devil inside everyone.
-Get your hands off her. -Horrible.
-Westridge! -What?
Take my gear up to the pilot house.
I'm not your bloody poodle.
What you say?
How dare you presume to order me about?
Presume?
How you like I presume to throw you in the river? You like that?
Take it upstairs.
Thank you.
Everyone else, don't move.
Get back.
Get back.
Terri, let's talk.
You want something?
I just want to talk to you.
I was thinking about the myth.
I don't know if you know, but this....
This film was supposed to be my big break.
And it's turned out to be a big disaster.
Anyway, I was just thinking...
...that maybe I could film you...
...capturing the snake and then...
...it wouldn't have all been for nothing.
I don't know. It could be dangerous.
Well, I know.
But at least you'd be there to protect us.
You need protection?
Yeah.
It's been a long time...
...since I had a woman.
You think I'm stupid?
I'm not stupid.
-It worked. -Asshole in one.
-Shall I hit him again? -Let's throw him in the river.
-Haven't we had enough of that? -I'm ashamed to say I enjoyed it.
Come on, let's just tie him up, okay?
This was all one big setup, huh?
Mateo, you stranded...
...the shipwrecked boat, your route to the hospital.
How can you forget about the wasp?
See, what you do is not so hard.
I can trap a snake too.
As smart as you are, you can't survive without me.
Hey, we're gonna be home soon, okay?
I can't believe how good you're doing. Hang in there, baby.
Is it hard to drive?
It's a doddle, like driving a Cadillac Fleetwood.
Tell you what, I'll give you a driving lesson.
Right, black knobs:
up to go forward, down to go back.
Red knobs: up to go fast, down to go slow.
Wheel: four turns hard over, left and right.
If you get into trouble, turn off the ignition, all right?
-Take it for a spin. -That's it?
Take us back to civilization.
Shit, no problem.
Take us back to...
...crisp sheets and hot showers.
The playoffs and a six-pack.
Eighteen holes of golf and a quadruple gin and tonic.
L.A. traffic and my cellular phone.
Don't start.
The waterfall.
It's a beautiful sight, baby bird.
The legend was right.
What is this place?
Oh, dear.
It's absolutely beautiful.
-What was that? -I think we hit the bottom.
-We did. -Hey.
Turn the wheel hard over left.
Right. Put it in reverse.
Shut it down.
Shit.
We got to winch ourselves loose.
Whoa, what are you doing?
-We have to get in the water? -We ain't got much choice.
I figure me and you go over here, wrap a rope around that tree.
You, you wrap a rope around that tree.
Pull it tight. If not, we're stuck here forever.
We've got to make it quick, in and out.
I rather hoped I'd done my bit.
That's our rope right there.
-Just enough to go around the tree? -Yeah.
We'll take this, get it around that trunk right there.
-Make sure it's secure. -Roger.
-Hate this. -Last time I was in water like this...
...I was up all night picking leeches off my scrotum.
Aren't you gonna pray?
Never look in the eyes of those you kill.
They will haunt you forever. I know.
I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace...
...to confess my sins...
...and to amend my life. Amen.
Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus...
...baby bird.
Okay.
Hurry up.
Back on the boat. Now.
Come on! Go.
Christ.
Get on the boat. Go on, hurry.
-Come on. Come on. -Quick!
-Get up. -Hurry, it's there!
Get up!
Over here, you fat-assed bastard.
Shit.
-Westridge, go up the rocks! -Go!
Get up the rocks!
It's coming. Go!
-Go get the gun. -What are we gonna do?
-Go get the gun. -What are we gonna do? Go get it.
Hurry up.
Come on, man.
Westridge, keep going, man.
Danny, watch out!
Danny, move your arm.
Westridge!
Look out!
Danny?
Danny! Danny!
Yeah?
Westridge? Westridge?
Shit.
Come on, hurry up.
I'm caught.
Come on, Danny. Hurry up.
Come on.
Danny!
No!
Danny!
Danny, hold on.
Hold on.
Come on.
You killed my warrior snake.
Get up.
The dart.
The tranquillizer's working. Get him.
Damn, the dart came out his back.
Come on, almost there.
All right.
Baby?
He lost consciousness again.
I'm gonna try to get us out of here. -The tree knocked us loose. -All right.
Hey, Terri, look.
They might have some fuel for us.
Let's check it out.
-Need some help? -No, I'm cool.
I don't even wanna know what happened here.
Me neither.
I hope they got some fuel, though.
Damn.
Those drums. Could be fuel.
A snake skin.
-Look, there's plenty of fuel in here. -Welcome.
Time to wake up.
Monkey blood.
I'm gonna kill you, Serone! I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you!
Don't get me upset.
See this?
Human bones.
That's how it comes out.
Ashes to ashes....
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Look.
Up, on your feet. Come on.
Go.
Gotcha.
Come on.
Get loose.
Let's get the fuel and get the hell out of here.
Don't worry, just go.
Run. It's coming for you.
Danny, where are you?
-There's a whole nest up there. -I'll have him chase me.
-No, I've got the legs. -Okay, we can trap it there.
Okay.
Go. Go!
Hey! Can you climb up the top?
-I can use the rope. -Hurry up, I think I can blow him up.
-I'm about to light it. -Go ahead, I'm at the top.
-Danny! -Okay.
Danny!
-Get out, the fuse is lit. -Danny, wait!
Push it on the side! Hit the hinges!
Hurry up! You gotta jump!
-I can't, it's too high. -Just jump!
I got you. Come on.
Did we get him? Did we get him?
We got him.
You all right?
Yeah.
We should get the fuel...
...so we can get the hell out of here, all right?
Come on.
Come on!
Bitch.
Let's get out of here.
Miss Flores.
You're a mess.
Found another one.
Here, let me see that.
Shirishama.
Serone was right.
Danny.
Damn.
I'll get the camera.
Wishing and hoping

Two and two, menu.
Brian, 22! Immediately!
-Guillermo! Guillermo! -Yes, sir!
-Two pigeons! -Two pigeons!
-Right away! -Right away!
V.I.P.
Very important table right here!
Give me two grain!
-I'll take that polenta! -Polenta, chef.
This is the one! This is the one I'm waiting for. Right here.
-Yes, sir! -I need that special meat right now!
-Yes, chef! -Pastry, get ready. It's coming at you.
I will kill your whole family if you don't get this right.
-I need this perfect. -Yes, sir.
I'm writing it up as
inventive and confident.
By the way, did the chap from Newsday ever call?
I'll check my machine.
Is this a real interview,
or just some cute guy that you're trying to set me up with?
Please, Julianne, I don't send you men anymore.
You haven't got the first idea what to do with them.
Hey, it's Michael. Jules, it must be months, huh?
So, I can't wait to talk to you. I'm in Chicago at the Drake Hotel.
I guess I'm...
Okay, well, call me, 4:00 in the morning, whatever. We gotta talk. Bye.
Who called? The man of the moment?
No, the opposite.
It's my Michael. Michael O'Neal.
He sounds desperate to talk to me.
The wandering sportswriter. Remind me about that one.
Sophomore year at Brown.
-We had this one hot month. -One hot month.
Yes, but, of course, you know me.
I got restless.
So, I get up the nerve to break his heart,
and he gives me this look.
And he said, "The thing that makes me wanna cry is
"I'm losing the best friend I ever had."
At that moment, I knew I felt the same way.
So, I cried for maybe the third time in my entire life,
kissed him,
and we've been best friends ever since.
We've seen each other through everything.
Losing jobs,
losing parents, losing lovers.
We've traveled all over.
Best times of my life, maybe.
Drinking and talking,
even if it's just over the phone.
Go on. This is so moving. Kindred spirits?
No, he's nothing like me.
He's like you, actually, only straight.
I remember this one night in Tucson, like, six years ago.
He takes a razor out of this tiny little Dopp kit, cuts his finger,
takes my hand, does the same to me.
-I'm going to be sick. -He says, "Swear.
When we're 28, if we've never married, we marry each other."
We never talked about it again.
I don't know what made me think of that.
You're about to be 28 in three weeks, right?
How old is he?
You think?
Desperate to talk.
No.
Cheers.
Hey, it's Michael. Jules, it must be months, huh?
I can't wait to talk to you. I'm in Chicago at the Drake Hotel.
I guess I'm...
Okay, well, call me, 4:00 in the morning, whatever. We gotta talk. Bye.
Good evening, the Drake Hotel.
Hi. Yes, I'm... I'm calling for Michael O'Neal.
But seeing as it's so late,
-if you could let me leave... -One moment, please.
Hello?
Hello.
You've been enrolled in the obscene caller of the month club.
Hey, beautiful.
It's so great to hear your voice. I miss you.
I've been calling you for over a month, you know.
Well, I've been on a book tour.
Well, I figured you were out of town.
No, I mean, my machine eats all my messages and...
Or you're just averaging 30 days to return a call.
Well, it's less when it's you.
Look, I have to ask you something, something incredibly important.
And if you turn me down, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
You know, if I could just tell you one thing first.
Well, this is... This is probably
going to hand you the biggest laugh of your adult life, I'm sure.
But I was thinking about you, and I was remembering this
unbelievably insane night that we spent in Tucson,
like, I don't know, 1,000 years ago.
And you probably won't remember this, but...
Are you kidding? I think about that night all the time.
You do?
But it's not why I called.
It's not?
I called because I met someone.
Well,
that's great, that's great.
'Cause you haven't really seen anybody, have you, since dingbat Jenny Lee?
No, you don't understand.
I've never felt this way about anybody. And she's all wrong for me.
Well, there's a good start.
No, I mean, she's a junior at the University of Chicago. She's 20.
Her name's Kim, Jules. You're gonna love her. She's beautiful.
And her dad is this billionaire,
and he owns the White Sox and some cable empire.
And you know I've always been kind of uncomfortable around rich people.
Sure.
But they're not like that. They're such wonderful people, really.
Salt of the earth.
So, you've... You've met her parents.
Yeah.
Jules, we're getting married this Sunday.
-Hello? -Michael. Michael.
Hello?
Michael, it's Wednesday night.
How can you possibly be getting married on Sunday?
Actually, it all starts tomorrow,
and it's one of these four-day weddings with all the traditional events,
and, like, 10 million people flying in from all over the world.
Okay, okay, okay, but aren't you working this weekend?
I mean, is that responsible?
Well, the Sox are at home, and Sports is letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.
You know, on Frank Thomas...
Wait. What do you mean, "irresponsible"? Taking off a weekend to get married?
Jules, I'm scared.
Maybe we should talk about this.
I need you.
If you can't come and hold my hand, I'll never get through this.
Please come.
-Please. -Well...
Oh, man, I can't wait for you to meet her.
UNITED AIRLINES
Listen, Jules, why don't we just stop and have a drink?
-You can take a later flight. -No, no, no, no. I'm a busy girl.
I've got exactly four days to break up a wedding,
steal the bride's fella, and I haven't one clue how to do it.
He adored me for nine goddamn years. Me!
I can see why.
Look, she has known him for what, like, five seconds?
Okay, plus, she's got billions of dollars.
Plus, she's apparently perfect, okay?
So don't go feeling all sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois.
I can't lose him, George. I'm gonna bring him back.
Hey, hey, there you are.
Over here! Jude!
Hi!
Can you believe I'm gonna do this?
Not hardly.
This just makes everything so perfect!
From the day I met Michael,
all I've heard is "Julianne this" and "Julianne that."
I've never had a sister.
Right off, I have this monstrous favor to ask you.
-Excuse me? -My best friend Angelique
shattered her pelvis line dancing in Abilene over spring break.
Be my maid of honor?
What?
Shouldn't you promote a bridesmaid
or someone that you've known at least 45 minutes?
My bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under the age of 40.
Debutante sisters from Nashville who are basically vengeful sluts.
Oh, my exit!
So this means I have four days to make you my new best friend.
It's time for you to force yourself to get personal.
-Do you like the color? -I think it's beautiful.
-Isn't that perfect for her? -Absolutely.
Now, this is going to be tighter.
-You don't want those things to fall out. -No, it's beautiful.
I'm not hurting you, okay?
I don't want her to trip,
so I'm going to take this up a little tiny, tiny bit.
Would you rather the daffodil?
I thought the bridesmaids all wore the same dress?
Not you.
You wouldn't be comfortable unless you were distinctive.
What else did he tell you?
You hate weddings. You never go.
You're not up for anything conventional
or anything that's assumed to be a female priority,
including marriage, romance or even...
Love?
Michael and I were a wrong fit right from the start.
He said that, too.
Well, I thought I was like you and proud to be.
Till I met rumpled, smelly old Michael.
Then I found I was just a sentimental schmuck
like all those flighty nitwits I'd always pitied.
It's funny, huh?
Yeah.
I need a cigarette.
George, how do you think I feel?
All she does is talk about her and Michael's future.
And she's just so bright-eyed and dreamy.
Fuck, the door. Jules, pull yourself together.
Yeah! And I don't know if I can do it.
Hi. Hi.
Want me to turn around or something?
-Yes. -Jules?
Not the person I was expecting.
I've seen you a lot more naked than that.
Well, things are...
Things are different now.
Yeah. Guess so.
Yeah.
You look really good without your clothes on.
Jules?
George,
she's toast.
-So the honeymoon is where, exactly? -Well, it depends.
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there,
or Phoenix, or depending on the Indiana-Cleveland game...
Garden spots, all.
A swing of maybe 40 degrees Fahrenheit represents a packing challenge,
but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suites.
It's his career. I'm supportive.
Look, I've been everywhere. I wanna be with the man I love.
That's what makes it a honeymoon.
I'm just saying he's lucky.
Takes one woman in a billion to put up with his array of shit.
The guy's a one-man festival of idiosyncratic...
Well, you've been introduced to the symphonic range...
Of his snoring? Yeah. He says it's worse than ever.
-You know that snarfle one? -Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Now it's kind of got like this phlegm-rattling thing happening behind it.
Guess what? Earplugs work.
-Oh, what about... -His cigars in bed?
I broke him of that habit.
But the bathroom's a swamp. He wears Reeboks to dinner.
He likes action movies.
He reads over my shoulder.
He loves karaoke bars, for God's sake, and I can't carry a tune.
Really?
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
That's a trademark move.
Don't touch that one.
But he sure can kiss.
You know, it's been a while.
I'm just gonna take your word on that.
After two weeks of cataloging all of his faults,
I made a command decision that changed my life.
I threw the list away.
He's not a balance sheet. He's Michael, and loving him means loving all of him.
You get nervous in small, confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to want to be protective,
but nothing ever could, ever did give me one moment's pause about this marriage.
Do you become hysterical in small, confined...
Except one.
You.
You'll always be there in his mind,
this perfect creature that he loved for all those years.
Well, perfection can get wearing after a while.
I'm not kidding. I had to face up to all of my competitive drives.
And believe me, I've got them.
-No! -After all, what am I gonna be?
Jealous of you for the rest of my life?
-Our paths will keep on crossing. -Space. Of course.
-He'll always talk about you. -It's only natural.
And the answer was so simple.
I was gonna predict that.
You win.
I've missed a step.
He's got you on a pedestal
and me in his arms.
My God, it's the bride and the woman she'll never live up to.
Are you okay, honey?
-I'm so sorry. -That would be us.
Did she say the wrong thing again? That is so in character.
-I'm Julianne Potter. -We'd be the vengeful sluts.
But you can just call us eager.
Hey, have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?
As M of H, you get first pick.
Don't pick the short, hairy, fat one. He's mine.
Kimmy's a virgin.
-Is this Michael's Julianne? -Yes.
I'm Isabelle Wallace,
and my handsome new son scarcely did you justice, girl.
Now, my husband says we should scoot you over to the ballpark
so you can hang with Michael.
But first you have to meet a lot of really old women.
That is, if you've absorbed enough profanity.
Come on! One strike!
Which of you gents ordered a beer?
Oh, let me help you with that.
Michael, you unwittingly imply that I'm clumsy.
Sorry, I was confusing you with somebody I used to know.
Julianne Potter, this is Hank and Eric from Sport magazine.
-Nice to meet you. -They were kind enough to give me a job.
-Hi, there. -How do you do?
And this is Walter, my father-in-law.
Future father-in-law.
COMISKEY PARK
Thank you.
If he gives you any grief, you come and see me.
And this guy you know.
Papa Joe.
I told him he should make you best man, darling,
but he had to go with his baby brother.
-Best-looking guy in any room! -Hello!
-Great to see you. -Hey, that'll do.
Scotty... Scotty, that'll do.
Sorry.
Now, remember, it is the duty of the best man
to dance with the maid of honor.
Dance. You can't dance.
When did you learn how to dance?
I've got moves you've never seen.
You're an impostor.
What did you do with my best friend?
Chicago Tribune
I'm still your best friend.
You just haven't seen me for a while.
All I'm saying is that some people might find
that kind of perfection boring day after day, year after year...
See, that's what I thought at first. How can you like someone that perfect?
No potential for long-range likability.
But then she does have a few good traits.
-Oh, now... -Such as?
They got him.
When I hug her, even in public, I don't have to let go right away.
She lets me hold her as long as I want.
Batting second, the shortstop.
-What? -Nothing.
Yeah, I forgot.
You and that yucky love stuff.
You always get like that when it gets sentimental.
I do not!
Okay.
Well, when we were...
When you and I were...
-When we were... -Together?
Yeah.
Well, did I... When...
Yes.
"Yes" what?
Yes, you pulled away when I tried to hug you in public.
Well, I've changed.
I mean, I'm not the girl that I once was.
Really?
Any relationship over two weeks I should know about?
This is not about longevity, Michael.
This is about
being comfortable
with the yucky love stuff.
All right.
And I am.
Karaoke!
-Where'd you find this place? -The doorman told me.
And you are singing the song.
All right!
I didn't realize this was a karaoke bar.
This is so great. My two best girls.
You folks thirsty?
Margarita.
-Blended, no salt. -She wants it straight up.
-And you? -Amstel Light.
Two words for you.
-Margarita. -Yeah.
Vespa.
-Florence. -Yeah.
Me hanging on in the rain all night.
I love Florence.
And the guy with the thing...
"Where's my pass?"
"No! The pier is for fishing!"
-"French kissing?" -"Fishing!"
I've always loved Florence.
You should take her there.
She's perky. She deserves a honeymoon.
-Oh, yeah, well... -"Oh, yeah, well..."
"If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento..."
What is that? I mean, you're off the road in September.
And when does fall quarter start for you?
I'm not coming back senior year.
Don't architects find a degree sort of an asset?
I travel every week.
Got college ball, motor sports, training camps.
I think the most important thing is for us to be together.
Say, pinky, I wanna hear you sing.
-Come on. -No, thank you.
No, Kimmy hates to sing. She hates it.
Oh, yeah?
-All right, folks. -Michael, no.
Everybody, my bride-to-be here is about to kick some ass.
-What? No, it'll be fun. -No, no, no, no.
No, no, no. Michael. She doesn't want to, Michael. Leave her alone.
Come on.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Please give it up for the dazzling vocal stylings of
Miss Kimberly Wallace!
Come on!
I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
I'm so used to doing
Everything for you
You suck!
Planning everything for two
Next!
And now that we're through
I just don't know what to do with my time
You suck!
I'm so lonesome for you It's a crime
Going to the movies
Only makes me sad
Parties make me feel as bad
When I'm not with you
I don't know what to do
I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
If your new love ever turns you down
Come back I will be around
Just waiting for you
I just don't know what to do
Like a summer rose
All right.
Yeah!
I need your sweet love
I need your sweet love
To ease
All the pain
That was just terrible!
Terrible!
You won't be lonely without us?
Desperately.
Maybe we don't have to go.
Your grandmother's dinner? As bride-to-be, she's got you on a technicality.
I'd babysit you,
but my loyalty is to the bride in her time of need.
It's not really a time of need.
Okay, well, if you're sure.
Sure?
Yeah, I mean, I'll stay with Michael if you're sure.
Okay.
Call me later?
Of course.
Bye.
Have fun!
You were pretty shocked when I told you, huh?
Shocked? No.
-A little. -Okay.
A lot.
I fell off the bed.
Well, that explains the thump.
You like her, don't you?
Yeah, I do.
That's enthusiastic.
Well, I mean...
No, she's... She's great.
"No. She's great."
I mean, seriously can't sing a note.
But...
to make that kind of sacrifice.
What?
Leaving school?
All of it.
Putting her career on hold.
All to follow you around in this dumb job
where you travel, like, 52 weeks a year
to places like College Station, Texas.
Dumb job?
Well, it's not a grown-up job, Michael.
My job never bothered you before.
It doesn't bother me now, but I'm not Kimmy.
Her father owns the Sox and cable sports.
Yeah?
I'm just surprised it hasn't come up, that's all.
What "it"? What?
Corner office with a view.
You in a nice blue suit, permanent Chicago address.
-Somewhat close to Mom and Dad. -No.
Never.
She would never even think of that.
You don't know her.
But Michael loves his job.
Sure, bad games, bad pay, bad towns, bad flights, bad hotels.
Real bad food, homeless, rootless, lonely.
Your copy makes it in maybe one issue out of four.
What's not to love?
Why would he trade all that for running, say,
a piece of the PR at a powerful complex conglomerate like your father's?
That's just the sort of thing my father and I discussed.
I'm not surprised.
So, do you think he'd really accept?
Michael? A job like that?
By any yardstick that involved sanity,
it'd be the greatest thing that ever happened to him.
Present company excepted.
This is what we do.
-We make your dad a co-conspirator. -Kim.
Michael does a favor for Walter.
Walter's reorganizing his public relations
and needs a brilliant guy that he's close to
that he can completely trust.
Then you beg. "Michael, please do this for Daddy.
It's only six months. It would mean so much to me."
He'll see right through it.
Only if he wants to.
At the end of six months, he will be happy,
settled, successful.
-You look beautiful. -Thank you.
Do you have a date later or something?
Never can tell.
Hi.
Just the way you look tonight
Remember?
Okay, kid, you're up.
Well, it's really my father who needs the favor.
You see, he's reorganizing some of the divisions of the company.
Public relations is a real problem area for him.
It would only be six months, maybe.
-Or three or four. -And you knew about this?
Well, I think you ought to listen to her, Michael.
It's her life, too.
Well, you gonna tell me that Walter thought this one up?
Why don't you start by being honest for one second, Kim?
I am being honest.
What? All of a sudden I'm supposed to drop out of school,
forget my family, forget my career,
forget about all the things I had planned for my life?
Forgive me for screwing up your plans.
I'm glad I'm hearing about this now, before it's too late.
-What is that supposed to mean? -What am I supposed to do with my life?
I work in a low-paying, zero-respect job, which, unfortunately, I happen to love.
Michael, it sounds like a great opportunity.
Does it really?
How come you never took some sellout establishment job?
I'll tell you why, because that isn't you.
And guess what, Kim, that's not me either.
Okay, if that's the way you feel...
You're damn straight that's how I feel!
Just come out and say it.
My job's not good enough.
I'm not good enough.
Michael, I never said that.
Yes, you did.
Great, Kim.
You wait till two days before our wedding to lay this on me,
and I'm supposed to just roll over and drool.
No.
Fine. I'm the asshole.
I'm an insensitive sexist asshole!
-You're better off without me. -No, Michael! No!
You're so... So right.
I was so wrong.
We settled this, and I reneged. That just wasn't fair.
You have to forgive me and forget this ever happened.
Okay? Or I'll just die! Please!
I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry. -No, no.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -I'm sorry.
I love you.
George and Werner are not in.
Brevity is the order of the day.
George! Answer this, damn it!
I'm in a meltdown here!
She double-crossed me!
The little twerp groveled!
She's so wrong for him.
Michael and I are the same person.
Self-absorbed and vaguely lovable.
We deserve each other.
I'm running out of time. I'm completely out of sneaky ideas.
I have come to the end of my rapidly fraying rope!
George, you have got to think of something!
-Coffee, anyone? -Yes.
-I think that's in order. -That would be nice.
The Drake
The plane! The plane!
-Good morning, Tattoo. -Good morning, boss.
Isn't it a glorious morning?
If you say so.
George!
This is very Marcel Marceau.
Now, relax, relax. We don't want your face coming off with it, do we?
What a hideous room.
Oh, God.
Death by mini-bar, how glamorous.
You flew all the way here. You hate to fly.
And I have to get back this evening.
We have this thing with Werner's family in the Hamptons.
You're butting in.
What I mean when I say she's annoyingly perfect
is that there's nothing annoying about her perfection.
It is vulnerable and endearing, and that is annoying as shit.
And you like her.
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
This is my whole life's happiness.
I have to be ruthless.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.
I can make him happier than she can.
Yes, I am breaking her heart in the short run,
but really, really doing her a gigantic favor.
She would be so miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus.
Jules,
do you really love him,
or is this just about winning?
Seriously.
In the beginning, it was mostly this prior claim.
He belonged to me.
But now, when I'm with him,
he's just so wonderful.
How come I never knew that when I could have had him?
It's amazing the clarity that comes with psychotic jealousy.
George, believe me,
if he was feeling what I'm feeling,
then he would know how I feel.
It's horrible.
What?
Just tell him you love him.
Julianne, tell him...
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid of love.
Yeah, tell him you were afraid of love, afraid of needing.
-Needing what? -To belong to someone.
We all are, sweetheart.
I'm sorry about that.
Tell him...
Tell him this is the worst, cruelest, dumbest moment to do this to him,
but there it is.
He's got to choose.
Tell him the actual truth?
Well, maybe not the actual truth.
Highlights.
Oh, George.
Keep your arms at your sides, please.
Okay.
Good morning.
Michael, I have to talk to you.
You don't like the suit?
Actually, no, but that's not what I have to talk about.
Okay, one thing first, though. Excuse me.
Guard this with your life.
What is it?
The ring.
Why are you giving it to me?
I don't trust Scotty with it.
-Michael, I don't think I should... -Please. Please.
You're practically the best man anyway.
-Thank you. -Here, open it.
She'll like it, won't she?
Yes.
So, what'd you want to talk about?
What?
You wanted to talk to me about something?
Oh, yes, Michael,
we've known each other a long time, right? What, 20 years?
Okay, not that long, but it's a long time.
Yeah.
And in that time, we've grown...
Close.
Very close. Do you know what I mean by "close"?
-I think so. -Okay, good, so do I.
So, sometimes, when...
Could you excuse us, please?
Sometimes people think
they know how they feel about each other,
but they don't
until...
Until they do.
I have a point.
The question is, am I getting to it?
Why don't you? Whatever it is you have to say can't be that big a deal.
Oh, Michael, you know, "a big deal" is...
Is a relative term...
Who's that guy?
It's George. George. George.
I've told you about George. He's my editor.
What's he doing here? You working this weekend?
No.
He's here to be with me.
Why?
Because he's my friend. He's... He's my good friend.
My best friend these days, and...
You've been busy.
So, all of this... This has been about George?
I'm speechless.
Well, that's Jules.
Yeah. Hey...
Congratulations.
What?
I told him, puppy.
I mean, if we're engaged, we really shouldn't be ashamed of it.
He's racing back to New York. He just came in for a few hours to...
To fuck me.
Takes a few hours.
God.
-Give me your ring. -No.
-Give it to me! George! -No, you...
When you ask a girl to marry you, you have to give an engagement ring.
Julianne, I can't believe you're doing this to me.
I've come all this way to help you for this! You're insane.
Please, for one day, find me irresistible.
You got a deuce at the architecture foundation.
They'll be waiting in front of the fountain.
Stop it.
-Is something wrong? -Well...
I guess it's just the way that you always talked about George.
It always seemed...
Seemed like...
It sounded like George was...
-Gay? -Actually, yes.
Common misconception.
It is, because George likes to pretend that he's gay.
And why would you do that?
I find it attracts women.
Indeed, yes. Worked for me.
Big time.
Get off me.
Right.
Oh, my God, race you to the altar.
-Underplay. -Got it.
Hey! I'm Jules' fiancé, George.
Just in time for a quick pre-conjugal visit,
if you catch my drift.
I do.
You're going to humiliate me, aren't you?
Only if I can.
Just one thing. Stay away from...
What?
George! My God! My God!
I don't know why I'm so carried away.
It's so... It's so... Well, I don't...
-Against God's plan? -No!
Oh, no. It's just wonderful!
It's wonderful! Wonderful!
Mom! Mom!
What? What?
You have to meet George.
-George. -You must be Kimmy's little sister.
Julianne's fiancé. They're gonna be married.
-No! -Yes!
-What's going on? -Julianne's getting married!
-Oh, my God! -Why didn't you tell us?
There hasn't really been time.
I wanted to. I wanted to shout it from the rooftops.
But Jules said, "No, pumpkin, no.
This is Kimmy's day.
Let's not take the attention away from Kimmy."
Julianne.
"Dear, sweet, adorable, chocolate-covered Kimmy."
-Those were her very words. -Really?
I think I'm gonna cry.
-Me, too. -George.
This is so sweet of you to come to our rehearsal.
I insist you stay on to lunch.
-No, no, no, no! Absolutely... -Love to.
Love the bag, love the shoes, love everything. Love to.
Thank you.
Darling, what about your flight?
Canceled.
BARRY THE CUDA'S
I can tell you this now, but I was very worried about you.
About me?
Yeah, I mean, all the stories that Michael told me were hilarious.
But, I mean, all those broken relationships, all those men.
It must have hurt going through so many guys
and never finding the right one.
Hurt? She couldn't sit down for seven years
until she met teensy-weensy little me.
And all the while,
the man of your dreams was right in front of you.
She's talking about me.
-George. -Yes, darling.
How did you and Julianne meet?
George is my editor.
Yes, but, poopy, we met a long time before that.
Actually, it's a very romantic story.
Would you like to tell it, sweet pea?
No. It's private.
Not anymore.
I first met Julianne
in a mental institution.
Julianne was there visiting some French chef
she'd sent insane with a bad review.
And I was there visiting Dionne Warwick.
Dionne Warwick?
Well, yes, he thought he was Dionne Warwick.
Who is Dionne Warwick?
Sacrilege, darling.
She's Whitney Houston's aunt.
She's very good on the Psychic Friends Network.
Isn't she?
Do you know the way to San Jose?
So, there I was with Dionne, whose real name, by the way, is Jerry.
We're having one hell of a singsong.
Then, suddenly, breezing through the doors
from the electric shock therapy room, I saw her.
A vision in pink.
Pink?
You don't wear pink.
She does, Michael. Sometimes, she does wear pink.
-George. -You do.
I do.
I said to Dionne, "Dionne, who is this vision?"
"Surely she must be the understudy to some fabulous Broadway star.
I mean, look at her skin."
-George, please. -"Who does her hair?"
And in that moment I knew...
We don't all need to know what you knew...
Yes, we do.
I'm very curious.
They do.
I knew
that someday, we would end up like this,
like some glittering Doris Day-Rock Hudson extravaganza.
I said to Dionne, "Dionne, I'm in love.
Could this siren love me?
Are the gods that kind?"
And Dionne turned to me,
opened her lovely eyes and said...
What'd she say?
The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup
I'll say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair now
While wondering what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you
Forever and ever you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you forever and ever
We never will part Oh, how I love you
Together forever, that's how it must be
To live without you would only mean
Heartbreak for me
-All right! -Go, Granddaddy!
I run for the bus, dear
While riding, I think of us, dear
-I say a little prayer for you -He says a little prayer for you
At work, I just take time
And all through my coffee break time
I say a little prayer for you
Forever and ever You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you forever and ever
We never will part Oh, how I love you
Together forever, that's how we must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me
My darling, believe me
Believe him
For me, there is no one but you
Please, love me, too
Answer his prayer
And I'm in love with you
Answer his prayer now, baby
Answer my prayer, baby
Answer his prayer
-Say you love me, too -Forever and ever
You'll stay in my heart And I will love you
Forever and ever
We never will part Oh, how I love you
Together forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me
All right now!
Well, heartbreak for you, actually.
All right, you've made your point.
Get on your plane and go,
and I will call you at the turn of the century when I've forgiven you.
Oh, Jules.
It would never have worked out, you know.
Yeah, because it was dishonest.
Different temperaments.
Look, tell him you love him.
Bite the bullet.
George.
What will he do?
He'll choose Kim.
You'll stand beside her at the wedding, kiss him good-bye, and go home.
That's what you came here to do.
So do it.
George isn't my fiancé, Michael.
It's been over for... For ages, but he can't accept it.
I'd built you up so much.
I couldn't let him lose face in front of you.
He could never stack up to the one man I measure everyone against.
I don't know. This is strange.
I gotta tell you, when you...
When you told me that you were marrying George, I...
I got this really strange...
You were jealous?
Crazy jealous.
I'm sorry.
Can we maybe spend some time alone this afternoon?
Would that be all right?
This is built in the Art Deco style from the 1920s.
You'll notice in the center of the building here,
you have a setback for light to come down to the city.
The building coming up here on the left, the first building is
home of the Quaker Oats company. You can see the Quaker smile.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple of days.
About us, I mean.
Have you?
Well, there are a lot of memories to choose from, I guess.
It's more than that.
I mean, it's...
It's kind of embarrassing to say it this way,
but you've sort of been, you know, the woman in my life.
You've been the man in mine.
And I was thinking this could be our last time alone together, you know?
Except for that hot affair we'll have twice a year.
Except for that.
I mean, you commit to this wedding,
and then...
And then it seems like this momentum, and...
And then you forget you chose it.
You and I didn't...
I mean, in our relationships with other people,
we didn't use the word "love" a lot, did we?
Kimmy says if you love someone,
you say it.
You say it right then, out loud.
Otherwise, the moment just...
-Passes you by. -Passes you by.
Yeah.
We don't even have a song.
Kimmy and I, we don't have a song.
You think that's a bad sign?
Someday
When I'm awfully low
And the world is cold
I will feel a glow
Just thinking of you
And the way you look
Tonight
Is your dance card filled?
Well, I'd have to check.
You know, I keep it on PowerBook these days.
Is that right?
With each word
Your tenderness grows
Tearing my fears apart
With each laugh that wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart
WALLACE COMPANIES
One more detail.
Yeah, you have one?
Yeah, if you go with a 6% dividend.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Hi. -Hi.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
Well, I said I'd drop you at the stag. He's got a million things to do.
Sort of unofficial best man.
Yes, of course.
Well, Kim said
when Michael turned the job down that there was no friction.
Friction? No.
Good.
I haven't caused a problem, have I?
No, you haven't. Well, nobody has.
Listen, you're just a little bit early.
Actually, I needed to make some phone calls.
Would it be possible to use your office?
Of course. Right at the end of the hall on your left.
Thank you.
Take your time.
Okay.
E-mail.
email
New letter.
"To Eric Isaacson,
Senior Editor,
Sport magazine."
"From
Walter Wallace."
See, you can do this. It's easy. You just do it fast. Get it over with.
It's like it never happened.
"Eric,
I need a favor.
My daughter's
every happiness is in your hands.
I have offered Mike O'Neal,
my new son-in-law,
a great opportunity in my company.
To his own detriment,
Michael will not accept our offer
while he works for you."
"My daughter joins me in this plea for your cooperation.
With gratitude, Walter."
Do You Want To Send? Yes - No
Why would I send this?
He'd get fired.
No.
Save For Later - Delete
"Save for later."
It's not like I'm sending it.
I'm just saving it for a few hours.
Till we come back here and Michael can see it.
Perfectly harmless.
WALLACE COMPANIES
Yeah, they were all here.
What about Bill's reaction?
I don't know. I don't think he was happy with his 10% cut.
Send out this, this, not this, this.
-That's it. -Okay.
And by the way, I'm holding four or five e-mails
that I wrote over lunch. Send those out, too.
Yes, sir.
-Bye. -Bye.
All set?
I can't believe this! Did you try every key?
It's no big deal. She just gave us the wrong set of keys.
WALLACE COMPANIES
No. No, there's got to be a janitor or a...
Or a guard, or, you know, a cleaning woman,
or, you know, some kind of...
I mean, somebody has to be in this building! I need a brick.
I just need a brick.
What is the big deal about getting this file tonight?
I'm up against a deadline.
Me, too. I'm getting married tomorrow.
That's my point!
Everybody's gonna be so busy with more important things, and...
And so this is really my last chance.
If I could just get up there to Walter's office.
They're right by the computer.
Then I could just e-mail those figures right out, right now.
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Nobody's doing business.
Monday morning, crack of dawn,
-Walter'll walk you right up there. -No.
Give it up, kid.
You can't win 'em all.
The Drake
Good night.
Jules?
This thing mean that much to you?
Yes.
Come on. We'll use the phone in your room.
Walter's probably not even asleep. We'll call the house.
-I'll drive you up there. -Thank you.
I'll drive you up there, we'll get the right key
-and we'll go back down to the office. -Okay.
If I fall asleep on the altar tomorrow, you better be there to...
I'll be there.
These are all from Eric.
This fax is from Eric, too.
My wedding, you'd think my boss would leave me alone.
Maybe it's a congratulations.
What is it?
"Mike, I can't believe I'm doing this to you
on the night before your wedding,
but I think you need and deserve to know what you're marrying into."
"I received the following e-mail this afternoon.
'Eric, I need a favor. My daughter's every...'"
-Hello? -Isabelle, I need to talk to Kim.
Is there anything wrong?
No, I'm just tired. Please, put her on.
Thanks.
Jules?
Could you give me a minute?
Please.
Excuse me, miss? Are you locked out?
No, no, no. Just stepped out.
It's a no-smoking room.
Well, it's a nonsmoking floor, too.
Maybe you could go down to the lobby?
Why don't you have me arrested?
I mean it.
I am a dangerous, criminal person.
I do bad things to honest people.
You could make a citizen's arrest. I wouldn't struggle.
It'd be like getting Al Capone on tax evasion.
Can I help you, miss?
Do you smoke, "Richard"?
Yes, I do, but I'm...
-It's a nonsmoking floor. -Yeah.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
But you know what?
You know, my grandmother always said,
"This, too, shall pass."
Thanks, Richard.
I want you to quit this shit.
It'll kill you.
What happened?
It's over.
She denied it. She said I was crazy and paranoid.
A bad combination.
There's a big brunch tomorrow morning at her parents' house.
And she said, "How can I call it off? How can I...
"What am I supposed to tell everyone?"
-Oh, Michael. -No, it's for the best. It really is.
She was right.
I am crazy.
To fall for someone I hardly knew.
I'm so glad you're here.
Hey, you still got that ring?
I tried it on, and it won't come off.
Why don't we take a walk or have some food sent up or something?
I just want to be alone.
Is that okay?
Sure.
Maybe I'll...
Maybe I'll go back to New York for a while and hang with you.
-Eric'll understand. Or we could... -Yeah.
Go somewhere, if you want.
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento.
I've never been to Texas.
Yeah.
You what?
-Can I try that? -Sure.
-Excuse me. -Good luck.
So this is your basic call-off-the-wedding party?
I came here to confront everybody.
I'm not gonna just slink away like some coward.
Besides, she hasn't told anyone. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
Michael, there is a wedding at six o'clock.
Have you changed your mind?
Do you want to marry Kimmy?
I made a decision.
It's over.
I'll go tell 'em.
First...
Do you think she's all right?
Maybe you could go check on her for me.
These are the most beautiful flowers I've ever seen.
How is he?
Well, he's sort of wondering
why you haven't told your parents that the wedding's off.
Well, I don't know. I'm still...
I'm still hoping for a miracle, I suppose.
I mean, how could he think that my father and I would do such a thing?
I only minored in psych, you understand, but...
Maybe Michael couldn't commit to this marriage,
so he created a delusion,
produced an unconscious psychosomatic manifestation of...
I'm better with food.
Okay.
You are Michael.
You're in a fancy French restaurant.
You order
crème brûlée for dessert.
It's beautiful.
It's sweet.
It's irritatingly perfect.
Suddenly, Michael realizes he doesn't want crème brûlée.
He wants something else.
What does he want?
Jell-O.
Jell-O?
Why does he want Jell-O?
Because he's comfortable with Jell-O.
Jell-O makes him comfortable.
I realize, compared to crème brûlée, it's Jell-O,
but maybe that's what he needs.
-I could be Jell-O. -No.
Crème brûlée can never be Jell-O.
You could never be Jell-O.
I have to be Jell-O.
You're never gonna be Jell-O.
Now you need to come clean with your parents,
because if you're waiting for that
"do you take this man" part, it's considered poor form.
I love him.
And whatever delusions I drove Michael to, there's truth at the heart of it.
You see, I want him to work for my father.
I want to stay in school, and I want a life of my own.
Please, tell him that it's my fault and that I love him.
You're the only person that I trust.
-I'll be right back. -Thank you.
-Elliot. I love you. -I love you, too.
-How is she? -What about me, guys?
Hey, knock it off!
Yes, sir.
-I asked you, does she... -She admits that it's her fault.
Totally, completely, inexcusably her fault.
Do you think she still loves me?
Love... Well, it's a strong word.
And I don't know that I'm necessarily qualified as a...
I guess I wouldn't be totally off base if I said that, in her way,
-she does possess strong feelings... -Jules.
Sure she does, Michael.
She's crazy about you.
You fill up my senses
Like a night in the forest
Like the mountains in springtime
Like a walk in the rain
Tell her I'll marry her at six o'clock,
if she'll still have me.
Like a storm in the desert
Please.
Like a sleepy blue ocean
I'll be right... Right back.
You fill up my senses
Come love me again
What did he say?
He said,
"Marry me."
Thank God you were here.
Yeah.
I got so confused.
It happens.
Got a minute?
What's up?
I'll have to say this quick,
or I'm just gonna have this massive coronary,
and then you'll never hear it, and you have to.
This is, by far, the dumbest thing I've ever done in my entire life.
So dumb, in fact, that I can't.
Oh, but I'm gonna.
What's wrong?
Michael,
I love you.
I've loved you for nine years.
I've just been too arrogant and scared to realize it,
and, well, now, I'm just scared, so...
I realize this comes at a very inopportune time,
but I really have this gigantic favor to ask of you.
Choose me.
Marry me.
Let me make you happy.
That sounds like three favors, doesn't it?
But...
Kim!
Michael!
What are they doing?
They're just lovely together.
Aren't they?
Kim!
Michael!
That's our maid of honor.
She's from New York.
Kim!
-Michael! -Kim!
Kim!
Michael! Michael, wait!
Michael, wait! Please! You'll never catch her!
Doesn't anybody leave their car unlocked?
Nobody trusts anybody anymore!
A Good Samaritan!
Hey, come back here!
"Shy tendrils of russet pleasure
began their unbidden journey.
She moaned.
The tonnage of years of anguish, sacrifice..."
-Yes? -It is not going well!
This is what comes of telling the truth!
Or even part of it!
You know, getting what you deserve isn't fair!
Where are you?
I have stolen a bread van, and I'm chasing Michael down Michigan Avenue.
George, this is all your fault!
I told him the truth! I said that I loved him.
And I kissed him, and this is what's happened!
Jules, a question.
When you kissed Michael, did he kiss you back?
What do you mean? We were lip to lip!
I mean, was there anything on the other side of that kiss
that leads you to believe that this chase will end happily?
That's beside the point. We were interrupted.
-Who interrupted you? -Kimmy!
She ruined everything!
And Michael started chasing her before he could answer me.
-Michael's chasing Kimmy? -Yes!
-You're chasing Michael? -Yes!
Who's chasing you? Nobody. Get it?
-There's your answer. Kimmy. -No!
Yes! Jules, you are not the one!
Now, for God's sake, the wedding is at 6:00 p.m.
You have a small, but distinct,
window of opportunity to do the right thing.
George!
All aboard!
Michael!
I have a confession to make.
Another confession.
Besides that I love you, this is even worse.
The e-mail that Walter sent to your boss,
I wrote that.
I'm the bad guy.
Are you crazy?
Jules, are you... Are you completely insane?
I mean... I mean...
Jules, how could you do that?
Michael, it wasn't supposed to get sent.
I just...
I just wanted you to get mad at Kimmy.
God.
I have done nothing but underhanded, despicable,
not even terribly imaginative things since I got here.
But I was...
Michael, I was just trying to...
To win you...
To win you back.
But that doesn't excuse any of it.
I'm pond scum.
Well, lower, actually.
I'm like the fungus that feeds on pond scum.
Lower.
The pus that infects the mucous
that cruds up the fungus that feeds on the pond scum.
On the other hand...
Thank you
for loving me that much.
That way, it's pretty flattering.
Except it makes me fungus.
Well, that part, I knew.
God.
I'm glad you didn't get on that train.
Well, I came here looking for her.
Why would she be here?
This is where I proposed.
I had to cover a game in Milwaukee, and she saw me off.
And the train was starting to leave...
and I jumped up on the step, and I held the handle
and without
a thought in my head, I just shouted,
"Marry me!"
And the train was pulling out, and she just suddenly screamed, "Yes!"
Just once.
And blew me a kiss.
Well,
it would've been a nice wedding.
Michael, you can't believe that you've lost her.
I mean, sooner or later, you will find her,
and you'll look into her eyes, and you'll see all that love.
I just hope that it's sooner rather than later,
or else I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.
Okay, just wait. Wait.
We'll... We'll... We'll split up.
And you will go to every romantic place the two of you have,
and I will go, I don't know, someplace brilliant, and we'll find her.
We will find her.
Mandy!
Wallace egregious residence. Mandy speaking.
Hi, it's Jules. You guys haven't gotten a call from Kimmy, have you?
Oh, no. She slipped out, the little monkey.
-During the commotion. -Commotion?
Well, my sister was licking an ice sculpture,
and her tongue froze right to it.
And that's a commotion?
It's a sculpture of the David.
And so Kimmy would be...
She's probably with Michael doing the nasty.
Either that, or crying in her nachos down at Comiskey Park.
Excuse me?
I had this crank call from some guy who says he saw her in the luxury box.
-Right. Okay. -I said, "What would the bride be doing?"
Right, right. Listen, can you bring my dress to the church?
And I have to pick something up before the ceremony.
Okay. Don't forget to shave, now.
Here we go. Here's the hair dryer.
All right. There we go.
It's gonna be okay. No, no, no pictures. No pictures.
Please, no pictures.
Excuse me.
-Kimmy! -Kimmy!
-Kimmy! I know you're in here. -Kimmy!
The guard saw you come in!
Just leave me alone, you bitch!
Kimmy.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Catfight!
You came here pretending to be my friend, and I made you my maid of honor!
Who asked you to do that?
You knew me, what, eight minutes?
Michael trusted you, so I trusted you.
You wanted to keep me close. You didn't trust me for a second.
I was right.
Of course you were right, but that's not my fault.
You kissed him!
-At my parents' house! -That's cold.
-On my wedding day! -Bitch.
Tramp.
Shut up!
Now, I love this man, and there is no way that I'm gonna give him up
to some two-faced, big-haired food critic.
All right. Okay. All right! All right!
I kissed him.
I tried to steal him.
I lost.
He doesn't love me.
He loves you.
Kimmy, I haven't done much that I'm proud of the last three days.
I'd like to take you to the church
so you can walk down that aisle and marry the man of our dreams,
'cause he sure wants to marry you.
So raise our glasses, and wish Mike and Kim every happiness
for a long and happy life together
filled with happiness.
Well, I guess that's it.
To the bride and groom!
-Hear, hear! -Hear, hear!
Now let's hear from the maid of honor, the lovely Julianne.
I had the strangest dream.
I dreamt that some psychopath was trying to break the two of you up.
Luckily,
I woke up, and I see
that the world is just as it should be,
for my best friend
has won the best woman.
I didn't get you a gift.
However,
this is on loan
until you two find your song.
So...
Someday
When I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow
Just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight
Oh, but you're lovely
With your smile so warm
With your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me
-But to love you -Ever want to love you
-Just the way you look -Oh, you look
Tonight
-It's mine! -I don't think so.
I got it!
-Good-bye! -Good-bye!
Bye.
Hello, George.
Hey, gorgeous. Having a good time?
Not particularly, but I did what I came to do.
What? You split them up?
No, I said good-bye.
Good girl. I'm proud of you.
I'd be prouder still if you were dancing.
I have big plans for dancing.
Just give me 30, 35 years.
The misery, the exquisite tragedy, the Susan Hayward of it all.
I can just picture you there sitting alone at your table in your lavender gown.
Did I tell you my gown was lavender?
Hair swept up. Haven't touched your cake.
Probably drumming your fingernails on the white linen tablecloth
the way you do when you're really feeling down.
Perhaps even looking at those nails, thinking,
"God, I should've stopped in
all my evil plotting to have that manicure.
But it's too late now."
George, I didn't tell you my dress was lavender.
Suddenly, a familiar song.
Then you're off your chair in one exquisite movement.
Wondering, searching, sniffing the wind like a dappled deer.
Has God heard your little prayer?
Will Cinderella dance again?
And then, suddenly,
the crowds part.
And there he is.
Sleek, stylish,
radiant with charisma.
Bizarrely, he's on the telephone.
But then, so are you.
And he comes towards you,
the moves of a jungle cat.
And although you quite correctly sense that he is gay,
like most devastatingly handsome single men of his age are...
You think, "What the hell.
Life goes on.
Maybe there won't be marriage. Maybe there won't be sex.
Why is there always a problem? It's a good question.
Do you want to go home? Do you want to turn around?
-Yes. -It's the Himalayas.
How long have I been talking about the Himalayas?
-How long? -Far too long.
Horst, when we get there, can you give me a hand, please?
-Yes, of course. -Ingrid, stop it.
Let's try to make the best of this.
Where's this idiot who's supposed to meet us?
Move! Move!
Mr. Harrer. I have your tickets.
-I'm late. Take me to my train. -No, you don't understand.
-What? -I am Peter Aufschnaiter.
I am leading the expedition. How do you do?
Here's our celebrity. Mr. Harrer?
May I say, Mr. Harrer, on behalf of the Reichssportsfuhrer,
we are honored to have such a great German hero on the team.
Thank you, but I'm Austrian.
Yes, but I'm sure that as a distinguished member
of the National Socialist Party,
you would be proud to plant our country's flag
on the summit of Nanga Parbat when you reach it.
Hans Lobenhoffer.
Lutz Chicken.
And a picture with your lovely wife.
And Mister...
Horst Immendorf. Family friend. No picture necessary.
When is the little one due, Mrs. Harrer?
About the time my husband reaches the base camp.
Thank you.
Why don't you tell the entire stinking country our troubles?
I'm getting on that train. Do you have anything you want to say?
Fine.
Go. Leave.
I'll see you in four months.
-Take good care of her, Horst. -I will, Heinrich.
Mr. Harrer?
We will travel 5,000 miles.
When we reach India, we will head for the Himalayas
and the ninth-highest peak on Earth, Nanga Parbat.
Germany calls it Unserberg, "Our Mountain."
Before us, four German expeditions attempted it.
All failed.
Eleven climbers were killed in storms and avalanches.
By now, the conquest of Nanga Parbat is a national obsession.
A matter of German pride.
July 29, 1939.
We have already made Camp Four at 22,000 feet.
Overhead is the Rakhiot Glacier and a difficult climb up the icefall.
The baby must be at least 1-month-old now.
I have been so confused and distracted.
I can't climb with my usual confidence.
Heinrich!
Are you all right?
Shit!
-Are you all right? -Shall we come down?
Lost a crampon.
Go ahead.
The weather's getting bad. We should rope up.
-Did you hurt yourself back there? -Just a scratch. I'll lead.
Rocks!
Look out below!
Hold me!
Heinrich!
Heinrich!
Have you got me?
Hold me.
You should have told me how bad that wound was.
I should take a look at it. I could sew it up.
It's not your problem.
Actually, it is my problem.
-It's my life. -What?
When you conceal a serious injury and put my life at risk,
I consider that my problem.
No, you put your life at risk. I saved it, so shut up.
Please, it is not your place...
Shut up!
The next time you lie about an injury, Heinrich,
you're off the team.
Try it.
August 4, Camp Five.
Some fierce storms have passed.
My team-mates are nervous about the avalanches
so we've been holed up for days.
Aufschnaiter should take advantage of this lowland weather to make high camp.
But he disagrees with me. Fool.
It seems the others don't mind sitting here waiting,
hoping, doing nothing.
So much time to question one's self is not good.
I am beginning to think this whole expedition was a mistake.
Run! Avalanche! Get out!
Leave everything!
Put that down!
We are going down now!
If they're frightened of a storm, send them down to Camp Two.
I can summit on my own!
Peter, always give the best man his shot!
He's trying to tell us he's the best man.
Give me two Sherpas. I can make Camp Six by tonight
and my final attack tomorrow!
-We are going down now as a team. -I've earned that peak.
-I want that peak! -As a team. That's an order.
That is an order! An order!
Follow me.
Dalai Lama photo. Good protection.
Take it, sahib. It will protect you.
No, that means nothing to me.
Dalai Lama. Dalai Lama photo.
Sahib, take it. Good protection for you.
Good afternoon, Herr Harrer.
Well, let's hope that Germany retreats from Poland
as quickly as you did from your mountain.
It might save you some prison time.
What is this? Who are you?
I'm sorry, but you're under arrest.
What charge? Failure to summit?
No, I'm afraid not.
You see, war has been declared between His Majesty's Government and Germany.
So all enemy aliens on British Empire soil are now prisoners of war.
-Stop, or I'll shoot! -Hands up!
Wait. No, you don't understand. I'm Austrian. I'm a climber.
I have nothing to do with your silly war.
I can walk myself. This is an insult.
You think you have the last word, but you don't.
Pigs! All of you, pigs!
October 15, 1939.
Reaching prison camp, I make a promise to myself.
I will be lying beside Ingrid before the summer solstice of the New Year.
The Himalayas are right in front of us.
It will be easy to escape and get lost in them.
My fourth escape attempt brings me no closer to my goal.
How far did you get this time?
All I have achieved is a certain dubious celebrity among the prisoners.
If only my hand could express what is in my heart.
I hear the guards are mailing letters for you.
-Yes. -Would you mail these?
Thank you.
Hey, Heinrich, have you read this book?
It was checked out to you.
-We need to talk to you. -What about?
About this.
Impressive. When do you plan to leave?
After monsoon season. And you?
I see you've chosen my route. Through Tibet.
You know, the few foreigners who have tried never came back. So, good luck.
-Would you like to come with us? -Why?
After all, you are the authority on jailbreak around here.
-We could benefit from your experience. -Please.
Stop this embarrassing charade.
Every time you escape, Heinrich, the patrols are doubled and tripled.
It is making life very difficult for the rest of us.
I prefer to travel on my own. Thanks for thinking of me.
The mailman has come.
Dear Heinrich.
Please sign the enclosed divorce papers and send them to my lawyer.
Horst and I intend to be married as soon as the divorce is finalized.
As for your letter, yes.
Your son, Rolf Harrer, was born while you were climbing the mountain.
He is now 2 years old and calls Horst, "Papa."
When he is old enough,
I will tell him his real father was lost in the Himalayas.
It seems the kindest thing to say,
considering you never wanted the child anyway.
Needless to say,
I have no intention of "resolving our differences" as you suggested.
They were resolved the moment you left Austria.
I'm sorry you have been imprisoned in India
and hope this dreadful war will soon be over, for everyone's sake.
Ingrid.
I'm coming with you.
This is your plan?
In my humble opinion, this is ridiculous.
Then since you are so humble, we won't ask your opinion.
Open the charts. Turn around.
Keep your back to the gate. Open the charts.
Keep talking. Wait for my signal.
We are clear. Okay.
Open the gates.
See to this. Open the gates.
I'm going off on my own.
So, good luck.
First escape from prison camp, November 18, 1939.
Rolf Harrer, three-and-a-half months old.
My 30th birthday, July 6, 1941.
Rolf Harrer, exactly one year, 11 months and 26 days.
Last escape from Dehra Dun. Rolf Harrer...
Take two and sleep it off. I'll send you a bill in the morning.
What are you doing here?
I missed you so much, Heinrich. I thought I'd pay you a visit.
What about the others?
The Italians were caught outside Nelang
and Lutz and Hans, they got sick and had to turn back.
-Sorry to hear that. -I'm sure you're heartbroken.
May I impose upon your generous nature and camp here tonight?
Be my guest.
Thank you. It is very gracious of you.
-Good. -What else do you have in there?
A ten-piece orchestra?
By the way, I heard
the Japanese have retreated all the way back to Shanghai
so even if you make it to the Chinese border,
you may have difficulty catching up with them.
I don't care if they're repelled all the way back to Tokyo.
You should if you want to get back to Austria.
-But I don't. -Don't what?
-Plan to go back. -Why not?
No particular reason.
But when you get there, tell my wife
that two years in prison camp is roughly equivalent to four years of marriage.
And I'm glad to be free of them both.
I'm not going back either, not until this shameful war is over.
-And where are you headed? -Tibet.
Then on to China, see if I can find some work there.
And you?
By my calculations, the Chinese border is 2,058 kilometers away.
Tibet is 68.
It's a long way to travel with such a heavy load.
No, just full of food.
-Precisely. -Mine.
That's too bad.
Those mountains are treacherous. There are glaciers to be crossed.
If you had roped up to me, I could've kept you alive.
Considering your performance the last time we roped up,
I think I'm safer without you.
Of course.
But I think you are wrong about that Tibetan border calculation.
By my measurements, it is 65 kilometers.
Care to wager a kilo of food on that?
All you've got is some stale crackers, Heinrich.
But I'm right. I'll win.
Devils! Go away.
Tibet, the roof of the world.
It feels as though we have ascended a medieval stone fortress,
towering above the center of Asia.
This is the highest country on Earth.
And the most isolated.
There it is. Tibet.
-Exactly 68 kilometers. -Congratulations.
Unfortunately, you've eaten all your winnings.
Yes.
Just smile and say yes. It's better that way.
It's amazing what you learn in prison, isn't it?
Tibet.
-No foreigners allowed in Tibet. -Oh, please.
No foreigner.
Oh, please.
Yes. Thank you. Of course.
No translation needed.
Some people are glad to see us.
Don't let it get to your head, Heinrich.
When the Tibetans clap hands, it means they are driving out evil forces.
We need to find food.
You talk to the Garpon, Governor of Province.
It is the prophecy. It says here
in the final testament of great thirteenth Dalai Lama.
"It may happen that, in Tibet, religions and government
"will be attacked by outside forces.
"Unless we can guard our own country,
"monks and their monasteries will be destroyed.
"The lands and property of government officials will be seized.
"The Dalai Lama and all the revered holders of the faith
"will disappear and become nameless."
Now you understand why we are not welcome to foreigners here?
Yes, but you must understand we're not here to threaten or harm.
We just need food, and then we'll be on our...
His Excellency, the Garpon.
Your Eminence, we're happy to see you.
We wanted to apologize.
Apologize.
And give you this very special gift.
You have nothing I want.
Please, from us.
Long live the Dalai Lama, His Holiness.
Thank you for the picture. Go back to India.
Two days into Tibet's western frontier and we are graciously kicked out.
Our guides have strict orders to escort us
to the Indian border some 40 kilometers away
and to shoot us if we attempt escape.
Must mean hello.
As long as they don't try to kiss me.
We have to stock up. I'm broke.
Don't look at me.
We have to eat, Peter. Know what time it is?
It is not negotiable.
My father gave it to me when I climbed Mont Blanc.
Everyone's climbed Mont Blanc, Peter.
If I had a watch like this, I would trade it.
-Where did you get this jacket? -North Tibet.
Communism soldier come from China. Very nice.
They give food, money. Very nice. Communism soldier.
Very nice, yeah.
You like military uniforms, yes?
I have German army boots. For you. Yes?
German army boots. Wait.
Give me these, for the guards.
Look!
Like this. You like?
Very good. They're tough.
My friend, shall I show you how German soldiers march?
You must make this face.
Come. Yes.
Stop!
Excellent. Yes. You, with practice.
Now, I will show you how German soldiers run.
Stand like this.
Guess what?
All clear.
Know what time it is?
You think I'm so happy to be traveling with you
I should foot the bill?
You are such a big man you don't need to contribute?
You have a problem, Peter?
Reminds me
what you said at the bazaar back there.
"If I had a watch like that,
"I would trade it."
You did not have one.
You cheap, lying bastard. You have three.
This is junk from some Italian prisoners.
I don't give a shit.
Haven't you ever heard of a principle?
What principle? What?
You want a watch? Go ahead. Pick one.
-And keep your principles. -Look at you.
Caught being a selfish brat and you're gloating.
You're acting like an old woman. What do you want?
Try apologizing.
Try feeling a little remorse.
And if all else fails, try wiping that smirk off your face.
Take your stinking watch and shut up.
I don't need another boring sermon from some frustrated glorified tour guide.
No wonder you are always alone.
No one can stand your miserable company.
Please, take them.
It was wrong of me to hide them.
-Keep this. -No.
I didn't deserve it, either.
Go ahead.
He'll be three-and-a-half years old now.
Pretty soon, she'll tell him I was lost in the Himalayas.
Which is fine.
Why?
Better a dead father than a lousy father.
Write him a letter.
Let him know you're still alive.
New York.
Venice.
-Paris. -Your Holiness, where are you?
It is time for your lesson.
Your Holiness, where are you?
It is time for your lesson.
Dear Rolf Harrer.
I'm a person you don't know, a man you've never met.
But you are someone who occupies my mind and my heart
in this distant land where I have gone.
If you can imagine a hidden place, tucked safely away from the world,
concealed by walls of high, snow-capped mountains,
a place rich with all the strange beauty of your night-time dreams,
then you know where I am.
In the country where I am traveling, Tibet,
people believe if they walk long distances to holy places,
it purifies the bad deeds they've committed.
They believe the more difficult the journey, the greater the depth of purification.
I've been walking from one faraway place to the next for many years.
As long as you have lived.
I have seen seasons change across the high plateaus.
I have seen wild kiangs migrate south in winter
and sweep back across the fields when spring appears.
In this place, where time stands still, it seems that everything is moving,
including me.
I can't say I know where I'm going, nor whether my bad deeds can be purified.
There are so many things I have done which I regret.
But when I come to a full stop, I hope you will understand
that the distance between us is not as great as it seems.
With deep affection, your father,
Heinrich Harrer.
Get up. Peter.
My God.
I'll give you these.
Yellow head!
-No! Wait! We have nothing! -Give me money!
-We have no money! -Give me watch!
-Give me clothes! -We have nothing for you! Nothing!
Wait!
Where are you headed?
Holy city... Lhasa...
I have permit.
Impossible, foreigners not allowed in Lhasa.
We have special permission for Lhasa.
Lhasa, I have permit.
It is unseemly for the spiritual leader of Tibet to spy on people.
Only a month ago, we were certain of death at the hands of bandits.
And today, we have reached the gates of the forbidden city of Lhasa.
It is as difficult a goal as Mecca
and precisely as attractive because it is closed to all foreigners.
Even in our miserable condition, we feel the lure of Tibet's holiest city.
Home of the Dalai Lama.
Only a few foreigners had penetrated its mysteries.
Oh, my God.
Is it over?
No, it is not over.
You are invited to stay for lunch, if you like.
We'd like that very much.
I am Tsarong. Welcome to my home.
I am Peter.
Lord Chamberlain, may I request an audience
with the Regent and ministers of the cabinet?
It's about two foreigners who came to Lhasa.
With respect, Rinpoche,
if your intention is to stop the Chinese from recruiting political allies,
then demanding that they stop trying to bribe monks
is not the most effective tactic.
I asked the opinion of the ministers,
not that of a mere secretary.
Of course.
Forgive me.
You may leave now. Start translating the letter as written.
Of course.
Do you realize how many men could survive such an ordeal?
We should respect them.
If we return them to India, they'll surely go back to prison.
But they have no purpose here, Kungo Tsarong. No place to live.
I have invited them to stay at my guest quarters.
Assuming you would grant them permission to remain in Lhasa, of course.
Invited them to stay at your place?
But why?
Must one have reason to help those in need?
Beast.
I think she said you stink.
You do not need to introduce yourselves.
I know who you are.
I am Pema Lhaki.
Ngawang Jigme wishes to make a gift to you, so please take off your clothes.
Come on, let's get started. I don't have all day.
Well, this is most kind of Ngawang Jigme.
Who is he to be so thoughtful?
Secretary to the ministers of the government.
He wished to make you a gift of new clothes.
Please select your preferred article of clothing.
-You're a seamstress? -I am a tailor, sir.
The only tailor in Lhasa who has been to Calcutta
and can reproduce these silly costumes.
Okay, so
-I pick? -Yes, choose whichever you like.
-And you can make any of these? -Yes.
-Very good. -Did you make this?
Yes.
-Beautiful. -Thank you.
-Do you like this? -Whichever you like.
I will have this handsome tweed jacket
and this pair of sporting woolen trousers, please.
-Okay, good choice. -Thanks.
And you, sir?
Perhaps you could choose for me.
Thank you.
Please, sir, take off your chupa. I would like to measure.
Stand still, please.
This way, please.
-Please stand still. -Sorry.
-No moving, please. -I'm sorry.
That way, you will never fall. It's perfect.
Still, walking up mountains is a fool's pleasure, Heinrich.
Not so foolish, really.
Look at this.
Go ahead.
That's after I climbed the Eiger North Face.
That's Olympics. Gold medal. Not important.
Then this is another great difference
between our civilization and yours.
You admire the man who pushes his way to the top
in any walk of life.
While we admire the man who abandons his ego.
The average Tibetan wouldn't think to thrust himself forward this way.
Gentlemen.
Mr. Aufschnaiter. Mr. Harrer.
I'm sorry. Have we met?
No, we have not. I am Ngawang Jigme.
Yes, of course.
Forgive us.
Thank you for your generous gift.
It's wonderful. Thank you.
You are most welcome. Auf Wiedersehen. I am sure we will meet again.
Perhaps you could help us explain
why the ministers demand
that the Chinese government cease making
generous financial contributions
to Tibetan monasteries.
Do our gifts displease your government?
I cannot speak for the Regent nor the ministers, Excellence.
I am only a mere secretary.
Not for long, I presume.
Sit down.
A man of such obvious talent cannot be satisfied
with just translating letters.
Your diplomatic skill
would be richly rewarded here.
Serving my country faithfully is reward enough, Excellence.
I ask permission to take my leave.
-Hello, Heinrich. -Hello.
It looks like we're both in need of a good tailor today.
Yes, there's a...
Please, take a seat.
Do you like these? I'll buy them for you.
Thank you, but I don't eat much meat.
-Don't eat meat? -He says they are knives from West.
You put them on your feet to cut meat.
No.
-They are ice skates. -Yes.
You put them on your feet to skate.
To glide... Sort of, dance on ice.
-Yeah. -Why?
-Why not? -It's another fool's pleasure.
Let's get them. How...
No, for this?
Ten.
And for this?
Did you see?
Did you see that?
-Did you hurt yourself? -No, thank you. I'm okay.
Here we go. Up.
-You okay? -Did you bang your head?
No, I'm having fun.
-You must hold on. -Watch me!
-Do not look too much at the ground. -All right.
-Look only into my eyes. -Yes, all right.
-Okay? Into my eyes. -Yes.
Can I help you?
-Yes, please. -Here, take my hand.
Are you happy?
-Very happy. -Yeah?
I try to picture you, Rolf
and this is what I see:
A young boy who is strong and bright.
A boy filled with curiosity about life.
A boy who isn't afraid to learn from his mistakes.
Hello, married woman.
Hello, bachelor man.
-Heinrich. -Peter.
Congratulations.
Well, come in.
The Japanese army is facing a growing challenge
not from China's unified front
but from the powerful Chinese Communist Army.
Under the control of Mao Tse-tung...
The rumor is that the Communists have taken over
the whole of North and Central China.
Rumor? It's a fact, Peter.
Ngawang keeps me up to date on all China's war news.
So, how are things at Kungo Tsarong's?
Frankly, I wouldn't know. I moved out five months ago.
Really? It has been this long since we have seen you?
-Apparently, it has. -And have you been busy?
This is why I'm extremely busy
since I've been hired to survey the entire city of Lhasa.
Unfortunately, your place is too far out for me to include it on my map.
We like our privacy.
Yes, apparently so.
What about women? Have you met anyone you like?
Women.
Since I failed miserably with an Austrian wife
an exotic failure with a Tibetan wife seems misguided.
But to answer your question, no, I haven't.
You?
A friend's good fortune is a blessing, Heinrich.
I'm sorry you resent ours.
You must be very lonely and sad.
Heinrich!
The war is over.
Have the Communists won?
Your war, my friend. Germany has surrendered.
Where are you going?
Back home. Austria.
Letter.
We miss you.
I miss you, too.
"Dear Mr. Heinrich Harrer,
"You are not my father.
"Please stop writing me letters.
"Rolf Immendorf."
Honorable Harry Harrer?
-Yes? -A letter for you.
The Honorable Heinrich Harrer doesn't want any more letters.
It is from the Great Mother of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
Thank you for coming, Mr. Harrer.
Thank you for inviting me, Great Mother.
Do you know the rules of protocol concerning my son?
Not exactly... I know one bows and performs prostrations.
When you are in the presence of His Holiness
you must always be standing
bent in obeisance, hands folded in supplication.
If seated, you must always be seated lower than he.
Never look him in the eye. Never speak before he does.
Always refer to him as "Your Holiness."
Never turn your back to him. And never, never touch him.
He is the reincarnation of Avalokiteshvara,
the Bodhisattva of Compassion.
After his recognition, he was renamed
Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshi Tenzin Gyatso
Holy Lord, Gentle Glory, Eloquent, Compassionate
Learned Defender of the Faith, Ocean of Wisdom.
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, would like to meet you, Mr. Harrer.
As his advisors have not permitted a private audience with you
His Holiness has asked me
to bring you along to my monthly audience.
I'd be honored and moved.
Hello.
Yellow head.
You have hair on your arms, too? And legs?
-How about you? -Mr. Harrer.
It's an honor to meet you, Your Holiness.
Do you like movies?
I haven't seen a movie in about eight years, but as I recall, yes, very much.
So do I.
I'm glad to hear that.
I have a movie projector. And films.
I want to build a movie house. Here, at the Potala.
With seats and everything.
-Seats would be advisable. -Can you build it?
-Excuse me? -Can you build a movie house for me?
My advisors cannot disapprove, and you will be well-paid.
And you'll have to come here every day to build it, every single day.
When you are here, you'll visit me.
We can have conversations on many topics.
I would like to learn about the world you come from.
For example, where is Paris, France? And what's a Molotov cocktail?
-And who is Jack the Ripper? -Kundun.
You can tell me many things.
I'm proud to be of service, Your Holiness.
What is the problem?
-What is the problem here? -Worms.
Please, no more hurting worms. Please.
Worms?
In a past life, this innocent worm could have been your mother.
Please, no more hurting.
It's impossible. Please, no more.
But you see,
Tibetans believe all living creatures were their mothers in a past life.
So we must show them respect and repay their kindness.
And never, never harm anything that lives.
You can't ask a devout people to disregard a precious teaching.
Yes, but Your Holiness,
with due respect, we can't possibly...
I'm sorry, but we can't possibly rescue all the worms,
not if you want the theater finished in this lifetime.
You have a clever mind. Think of a solution.
And in the meantime, you can explain to me what is an "elevator."
Antarctica. That's down below.
-Here. -Yes.
Fantastic.
England.
Don't look at me for help.
Here?
Shift.
I know him. Honk.
Hello!
Turn!
Brake!
Heinrich.
Peter.
The robe of a minister is so much finer than your old brown robe, isn't it?
Please.
Everyone, please.
You must be very clever to get such a good promotion.
I did not intend to be a secretary forever.
Apparently so.
Well, congratulations.
Evil omen!
From his headquarters in Peking,
the Chairman, Mao Tse-tung, was triumphantly proclaimed leader
of the new People's Republic of China.
Chairman Mao vowed that the first task of the Communist regime
is to reunite the Chinese motherland.
He declared that the remote kingdom of Tibet
is an integral part of the Chinese territory
and must join the great new republic.
"And must join the great new republic."
People's Republic of China is advised
the government of Tibet recognizes no foreign sovereign.
We are an independent nation.
All the Chinese officials will be expelled from the borders of Tibet.
We wish you a happy return to your homeland.
Have a safe and pleasant journey back to China.
May you have a safe and pleasant journey back to China.
We wish you a happy return to your homeland.
-May you have happiness and prosperity. -Ngawang Jigme.
Let me see.
You have a very long lifeline.
Unlike others here.
When we are facing the light, it's day, yes?
When we are in shadow, it's night.
So if the sun is just rising in Lhasa
that means it is just setting
in New York City, perhaps.
That's why it can't be the same time in every place.
-Does that answer your question? -Yes.
Tell me more.
What else do you want to know?
In a few moments, you will be entering the world of mass media.
I can hear news from all over the planet?
I don't know if they have live broadcasts from the Tonga Islands
but generally speaking, yeah.
Do you listen to news from your country?
From Austria?
No, not really. Give me some light, Kundun.
Why? It's your home.
Not any more, it isn't.
But don't you have friends and family there?
A few friends, no family.
Keep the light steady, Your Holiness.
Why? Is everyone dead?
Do you know there's another sentence construction aside from the question?
I was married, but I'm divorced.
What did you do?
I didn't want a child, so I ran away to climb a mountain.
You have a child, Heinrich?
Although I've never seen him.
All right.
Let me show you how this thing works.
-Give it all you've got. -Yes, Mr. Harrer.
Happy Christmas.
Thank you.
Happy Christmas.
Thank you.
What is this special occasion?
This is Christmas. And this is for you, my friend.
Go on.
"I found it in a shop in the Barkhor.
"It has traveled a long way and finally come back home.
"Thank you for your friendship. Heinrich."
It is incredible.
Thank you for saving my life.
...must be liberated from religious oppressors.
Tibetans must be reunited
-with their brothers and sisters -Turn that off.
-of the great family of new China. -I'm very sorry.
Foreigners control Tibet's corrupt government.
Our Tibetan comrades must be liberated from foreign imperialists.
Tibet's million serfs must be freed.
How many foreigners are there in Tibet?
You, Heinrich...
Tibet will be liberated.
He asked for you, Mr. Harrer.
Kundun?
They were destroying the village I was born in, Takster in Amdo.
It was terrible.
It was just a dream. You had a bad dream. That's all.
But it was so real. Where did it come from?
My mind could never imagine such terrible things.
I can't sleep. I'm afraid the dream will come back.
A couple of insomniacs.
Tell me a story, Heinrich.
Tell me a story about climbing mountains.
That's one way to fall asleep.
Those stories bore even me.
Then tell me what you love about it.
What...
The absolute simplicity. That's what I love.
When you're climbing, your mind is clear
freed of all confusions. You have focus.
And suddenly the light becomes sharper,
sounds are richer
and you are filled with
the deep, powerful presence of life.
I've only felt that way one other time.
When?
In your presence, Kundun.
The Chinese have already secured much of the northern border regions.
They have ransacked a village, destroyed the monasteries,
burnt scriptures and defaced holy relics.
We've been told they've even killed some monks...
-Which village? -Takster in Amdo.
It's where His Holiness was born.
Go ahead.
When you were defense minister to the previous Dalai Lama
then you wanted to reorganize the army.
Can you do it now?
The People's Liberation Army is one million troops strong.
We have 8,000 men with 50 pieces of artillery
and a few hundred mortars and machine guns.
The task is hopeless.
Then you refuse the appointment, do you?
No. I accept it with honor.
You two gentlemen know about wars. What type of weapon do you recommend?
It seems the Chinese troops are advancing toward our northern borders.
Where's His Holiness?
The glory of a British coronation.
Nowhere in the world is there anything half so wonderful.
Only once or twice in the life of each one of us comes such a day as this
when we know that we are watching history in the making,
when we know that generations to come will look back on this day.
For May 12, 1937, will be one of the dates in history
that the schoolchildren will learn about, maybe a thousand years from now.
Every moment the thrill of excitement...
Do you think someday people will look at Tibet on the movie screen
and wonder what happened to us?
The coronation coach moves forward.
I don't know.
Don't you have all the answers, Heinrich?
No.
I don't.
On the same field where Tibetans traditionally gathered for picnics
ground was cleared to build an airstrip
so that the plane carrying three Chinese generals could land.
Nearby, the Tibetan army practiced its maneuvers.
Some of the soldiers wear ancient mesh armor.
They bring old muskets and spears as artillery.
The spectacle of a peace-loving nation, vainly attempting to create a military.
The fears of war on my friends' faces
Stand at ease!
...strike a deeply-buried personal chord.
Echoes of the aggressions of my own country,
the will to overpower weaker peoples
bring shame to me.
I shudder to recall how once, long ago, I embraced the same beliefs,
how at one time I was, in fact,
no different from these intolerant Chinese.
The Tibetans say an enemy is the greatest teacher
because only an enemy can help develop patience and compassion.
They believe with rock-like faith that the power of their religion
will protect them against these Chinese.
In preparation for the generals' visit,
sacred ceremonies are performed throughout Lhasa.
Sculptures of deities have been carved with great care in butter.
As the sun melts them, they become a reminder that nothing lasts.
The rising star of the cabinet, Minister Ngawang Jigme
made an offering of his own to greet the Chinese generals
and lead them through Lhasa.
Raising their flag is an honor the Chinese don't deserve.
When you are not strong enough to fight, you should embrace your enemy.
With both arms around you, he cannot point a gun at you.
Nothing in politics is a matter of honor, my friend.
History repeats itself, even in paradise.
General, we shall have our audience with His...
General, the monks have been making this mandala of sand for many days.
It is a symbol of enlightenment and peace.
General!
We do not sit lower than he does.
But, General, it is our custom.
I can sit down there.
Your Holiness, this is General Chang Jing Wu,
General Than Gua Ha, General Than Gua San.
They wish to have an audience with you.
May you have happiness and prosperity.
They are promising regional autonomy and religious freedom
if Tibet accepts that China be its political master.
Until I attain my majority, the Regent is the political leader of Tibet.
You should have requested an audience with him
to discuss these important matters of the world.
My experience of such things is limited.
I am a simple Buddhist monk.
All I know is the scripture and the words of Lord Buddha.
He said, "All beings tremble before danger and death.
"Life is dear to all.
"When a man considers this, he does not kill or cause to kill."
You must understand.
These words are ingrained in the heart of every Tibetan.
It is why we are a peaceful people
who reject violence on principle.
I pray you will see this is our greatest strength,
not our weakness.
I thank you for your visit.
An offering to the enlightened ones.
Religion is poison.
The Chinese have attacked the Tibetan frontier near Dengo.
No!
"Today at the dawn, 84,000 troops of the 1st and 2nd Field Armies
"under the overall command of General Chang Jing Wu
"attacked the Tibetan frontier near Dengo.
"The Tibetan army believes an attack on Chamdo is imminent.
"Ngawang Jigme, our newly appointed governor
"is preparing to send troops toward the Chinese column
"in order to stop their progression."
As you know, Ngawang Jigme, Chamdo is the gateway to Tibet.
If Chamdo falls, the whole of Tibet will fall.
If I did not know that, I would not have been appointed governor.
You do realize, our troops are committed to fighting the Chinese to the last man?
They would rather die than surrender.
Rest assured, there will be no surrender as long as I am in Chamdo.
Radio Lhasa.
Now.
We request permission to surrender.
-But there will be no surrender... -I said, "Radio Lhasa."
Permission to surrender now.
We lost the war in 11 days, Heinrich.
This surrender is our death sentence.
And I'm afraid our friend Ngawang Jigme has issued it.
He abandoned Chamdo and then destroyed the ammunition dumps.
Without weapons and ammunition
there was no hope for the troops who wanted to fight.
Our guerrillas could have held the mountain passes for months,
even years.
It would have bought us time to make appeals for help to other nations.
Now it's lost.
They broke down the gates.
Hello, my friend.
We did what was the best for our country,
for Tibet.
On the way to Lhasa, I would see Tibetans wearing these jackets.
"Chinese soldiers. Very nice.
"Give food, clothes, money. Very nice."
It's strange to me that something so harmless as a jacket
could symbolize such a great lie.
After all these years, you still do not understand Tibetan ways.
To return a gift is unforgivable.
A man who betrays his culture should not preach about its customs.
There was a time I would have wished you dead
but your shame will be your torture.
And your torture will be your life.
I wish it to be long.
We pray that His Holiness, the Dalai Lama
will be granted the power to unify his people.
We humbly ask the Tibetan government to honor our request
and let the Dalai Lama attain his political majority.
You have the entire palace in a panic.
I'm hiding from the world for a day.
Kind of difficult in a glass house, no?
It's the Moonlight by Debussy.
What else?
What else do you know about this song?
Kundun.
Him, him, and him.
I hope you've received your invitation to the enthronement ceremony.
Yes. Thank you.
-It's next week. -Thank you.
Do I look like an egghead?
No, they suit you.
We have a saying in Tibet,
"If the problem can be solved, there is no use worrying about it.
"If it can't be solved, worrying will do no good."
So stop worrying, Heinrich.
You have to leave.
You have to leave Tibet, Kundun. Your life's at great risk.
Forgive my presumption, but I made arrangements to get you out. Safely.
We should leave directly after the enthronement.
The Chinese would never expect it...
How can I help people if I run away from them?
What kind of leader would I be?
I have to stay here, Heinrich.
Serving others is my path to liberation.
-Then I don't go either. -Why not?
Because you are my path to liberation.
The Buddha said, "Salvation does not come from the sight of me.
"It demands strenuous effort and practice."
So work hard and seek your own salvation diligently.
I am not your son
and I never thought of you as my father.
You were much too informal with me for that.
Do you ever think about him?
And what do you think about?
It's not the conscious thought, really, Kundun.
It's just always there.
When I crossed Tibet, he was with me.
When I came to Lhasa, he was with me.
When I sit beside you,
he's there with me.
I can't even imagine how I pictured the world without him in it.
Then you should go home and be his father.
I know.
You have finished your job with me.
But you have to stay for my enthronement.
I want you to see me in all my pomp and glory.
It'd be a pleasure, my friend.
From the government of Tibet,
to Your Holiness, the fourteenth Dalai Lama,
we ask you to rule your people,
as the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet.
By your prayers and wishes, I humbly accept.
Butter tea. It was never my cup of tea.
-One was enough. -Yes, we must follow the custom.
A fresh cup of tea is poured for the loved one departing.
It sits untouched, waiting for his return.
May all travelers find happiness wherever they go.
Without any effort, may they accomplish whatever they set out to do.
And having safely returned to the shore,
may they be joyfully reunited with their relatives.
Mr. Harrer
from His Holiness.
Hello.
-Hello, Horst. -Hello, Heinrich.
Rolf, come out and meet him.
No, I don't want to.
May I?
Rolf, take your time.
Hey! What are you doing cutting holes in my wagon?
Sorry, Señor Lopez. We were just waiting for Zorro.
-Go home, muchachos. -Do you think he's going to come?
Someone thinks he will.
Joaquin, Alejandro, once I carved coffins for your mother and father.
I would hate to carve ones for you. Now, go!
Alejandro, Joaquin, this is no place for you. Get back to the mission.
Don Montero, for the love of God, why are you still here?
Now, now, Don Luiz. Calm, calm.
Santa Anna's men are three miles from the town. You have to go now.
The government of Spain would like to thank you for your devoted service.
This land is the property of the Spanish government.
In two hours it will be the property of the Mexican government... ...unless I hand them over to you.
I am well acquainted with Santa Anna. He will realize that the dons... ...will be dutiful taxpayers and he will respect your claims.
The rest of Alta California I have divided equally...
...among the other dons. Make sure that all of them receive their grants.
Get the children out of the plaza immediately.
The children should never have to see the things we do.
I want to see! Put me down.
Zorro?
I saw him. I saw Zorro. Come on.
Who are these men that you would risk your life to have killed? Who are they? No idea.
Three peasants pulled at random from the crowd.
Where is he?
Go.
Come on.
My thanks to you, gentlemen.
Now, if you will excuse me, I'm missing my own party.
Kill him!
You would murder three innocent men to capture me?
I would murder 100 innocent men if it meant killing you.
Three men, three cuts. A small memento of Mexico, Rafael.
To remind you not to return.
Tornado, my old friend, you are getting too old for this.
Yes, me too.
Is she warm enough?
I always put on an extra blanket for you, Señor.
But the good prince was not afraid of the evil king. He raced across the drawbridge, fighting off 100 guards.
And then, looking very handsome and dashing in the late-afternoon sun...
...he leapt onto the balcony and thrust his enchanted sword...
...under the king's chin. "You would kill three innocent men just to capture me?"
"Yes."
Then suddenly lightning flashed and thunder shocked the wasted land.
The evil king glared at the good prince and said....
Something very forgettable. And the good prince, what did he do?
Well, he leapt from the balcony onto his faithful old steed, Tornado...
...and raced home to his beautiful wife, Esperanza... ...and to his little child, Elena.
Never to do anything so foolish or dangerous again.
She loves to hear your stories.
It's only the sound of my voice. One day she will have no time for them.
I never tire of them. Why should she?
Esperanza.
She already has your strength.
Today she broke the little clay horse you made for her.
Diego.
It's just a scratch.
Diego, you promised me.
No more nights waiting up praying you come home alive.
The Spaniards are going home. Today is Zorro's last ride.
From now on we will grow old together with our five children.
-Five? -Yeah. Not enough?
I love you.
Doña de la Vega, still as beautiful as ever.
Don Rafael, what an honor. The governor in my home.
-You'll stay for dinner, of course. -I have come to apologize, Esperanza.
I'm sorry that I could not protect this country from the peasants.
I'm sorry that I couldn't make you love me.
And I'm sorry that I have to leave you without a husband.
Arrest him.
Blood never lies, Zorro.
You are a traitor to your country and your class. Take him away.
Wait.
-No! -No!
I would never have let any harm come to her.
She was never yours to protect.
Elena.
I want you to live with the knowledge... ...that you have lost everything that you hold dear.
I want you to suffer as I have suffered... ...knowing that your child should have been mine.
Elena! Elena!
Let me hold her.
Let me hold her!
Rafael!
She has her mother's eyes.
Rafael! You'll never be rid of me!
Stayed on their track Bringing them back
So pay the bounty now to me 'Cause....
'Cause...?
-Nobody's tough as Jack -Nobody's tough as Jack
-Nobody's tough as Jack -Nobody's tough as Jack
Now you're getting there. Like I done told you... ...singing can lighten your terrible load.
Come one, come all, for the fright of your life.
See the notorious Murrieta brothers. Robbers, horse thieves...
...bandits, people of the worst sort. Hey! Get out here.
Garcia. The Murrieta brothers.
Get over here.
These men are now in the custody of Corporal Armando Garcia. We will take them the rest of the way.
-Claim your bounty in Tlaxco. -When bulls start wearing bloomers.
How much are we worth?
All figured, about 200 pesos.
Two hundred pesos? That's it? A lousy 200 pesos apiece?
-We are wasting time. -That's 200 for the both of you.
What? Are you crazy? Don't take it, Jack.
Touch my brother again, and I'll kill you.
Yes, he will.
Hey, I thought you were tied up. That's because you're stupid.
Drop it. Drop it.
-They got a strongbox on the wagon. -We know. That's why we came.
It is a fact that I, the legendary Three-Fingered Jack... ...ain't even mentioned. I ain't even mentioned.
Ain't I the one that figured to kidnap the mayor from his own outhouse?
I tell you, I am the holy guts of this gang.
Without me, the whole dang opera falls apart.
Go. Go.
Come on. Get up, get up.
Go.
Go.
I want you to know I consider this an honor.
Bury the body. Bag the head.
Of course I have feelings for you.
Yes, yes, but quick. Hide in the barn.
He's coming.
What do you want? Please don't touch me. What do you want? Who are you?
Don Rafael!
Listen to me.
If any of you is, or ever was...
...that masked man all dressed in black known as Zorro...
...reveal himself now.
I'm Zorro!
-They took my mask, my sword-- -Silence, you old fool!
I am Zorro! I am the man you want. I am the original--
Liar! Anyone can see you are too tall.
Get him out of here before he starts to stink.
Did you find him?
He's dead.
Back to the boat. I need some sleep before landing tomorrow.
The governor has returned!
Luiz. Welcome home, Rafael. It has been too long.
Too long, my friend. You said once you favored me above all.
Consider this a fool's apology for ever doubting you.
Come. A crowd has gathered to greet you.
-Don Pedro. -Don Rafael, welcome.
-You're looking well. -Thank you.
-Don Hector. -Welcome back, sir. Don Julio.
Gentlemen.
Please, please.
I know you are not really happy to see me...
...so let us all stop pretending, shall we?
You think I don't know that you have been paid...
...even threatened, to come out in the hot sun and greet me?
I understand exactly how you feel.
Why should you care about any of your leaders, past or present?
What did they ever do for you?
The Spaniards oppressed you, the Mexicans ignored you.
And the dons? Well, the dons, the dons.
The dons seem merely content to cheat and lie to you.
In fact, I put it to you. Who, in your entire history, has ever helped you?
Zorro! Zorro fought for the people.
Yes, Zorro.
Where is he now, Padre, your masked friend?
Unless I am mistaken, he hasn't shown himself in 20 years.
Twenty years!
People of California... ...the time has come to take our destiny into our own hands.
Not as Spaniards, not as Mexicans, but as Californians.
I stand here before you today with no mask.
Only a pledge, a solemn pledge that I will never abandon you.
And you have my word, the word of Rafael Montero...
...that I will do everything within my power to help you fight... ...for a free and independent California!
Father.
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce my daughter, Elena.
Thank you.
Can anyone tell me what this flower is? I know this scent. It's called romneya.
But it only grows in California... ...and I believe this is your first visit to our shores. Yes.
Hey, hey, hey. More whiskey.
Or whatever you call this. I don't want to see the bottom of this glass. Money first.
Money first.
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait!
-What about this? -Silver!
Of course, silver. The finest.
-Where did you get that? -It's none of your business.
Where did you get it?
It was my brother's.
He is dead.
-I'm sorry. -You're sorry? Why should you be sorry?
You should not trade it for a mere glass of whiskey.
Why not? You think I could get two?
Who is that?
-The man who killed my brother. -You're drunk and angry... ...in no condition to fight a professional soldier.
Get out of my way, old man.
Would you care to try again?
You're welcome.
-For what? -For saving your life.
-I would have killed him. -No, not today. He is trained to kill.
You seem trained to drink. You would have fought very bravely and died very quickly.
Who then would avenge your brother?
I would have found a way. -I have never lost a fight. -Except to a crippled old man just now.
-What is your name? -Alejandro.
You know, there is a very old saying:
"When the pupil is ready, the master will appear."
If you want to kill this man I can teach you how. How to move, how to think, how to take your revenge with honor.
And live to celebrate it. It will take dedication and time.
Why are you so eager to help me?
Because once, a long time ago...
...you did the same for me.
I can't believe it.
I never thought that, one day, I would be standing in the lair of the fox.
In the lair of Zorro.
This place was devoted to the training of Zorro.
Where were you all these years? I thought you were dead.
I was dead. And we will leave it at that.
I remember the last time I saw you. You were fighting a hundred men. -A hundred men? -I do not forget.
-A hundred men? -I do not forget. You were the greatest swordsman who ever lived. Yes.
Rafael Montero was the governor of California then. Do you remember him?
Rafael Montero. Do you remember him?
Yes. His soldiers killed many.
And he was the sworn enemy of Zorro. You.
-Montero has come back. -Good. Then you can kill him.
No, there are too many complications for me to ignore.
What complications?
I can see we are not gonna spend much time talking.
Montero has some design for California...
...otherwise he would not have retained the services of Captain Love.
-We must find out what that is. -And then what?
If you are ready, we will both tempt our fates.
Let's go, then.
Do you know how to use that thing?
Yes. The pointy end goes into the other man.
This is going to take a lot of work.
This is called a training circle. The master's wheel.
This circle will be your world, your whole life.
Till I tell you otherwise, there is nothing outside of it.
-Captain Love-- -There is nothing outside of it.
Captain Love does not exist until I say he exists.
As your skill improves you will progress to a smaller circle.
Each new circle brings you that much closer to your adversary. That much closer to retribution.
-I like that part. -Shall we?
Slow. Attack slow. Attack.
Slow. Again. Slow.
First triangle. Slowly. Good.
-Good. That is good. -Thank you.
Attack.
Good.
Time for a drink.
Perfect. Do it again.
One, five, three!
Six, four, two!
And lunge. Over-lunge!
Lesson number one: Never attack in anger.
Lesson number two:
Come with me.
What?
-So, what is lesson number three? -To get to lesson number four.
Again?
-Black Andalusian. Magnificent. -It looks like your old horse, Tornado.
Quiet, quiet.
Damned horse. What are you doing, huh? What are you doing?
I'll see you tonight.
Zorro, you look better than ever.
Be careful, señorita, there are dangerous men about.
Well, if you see any, be sure to point them out.
Listen. I'm going to give you the great honor...
...of being my horse.
We are like one spirit.
Damn it! Stop!
Go, go, go!
Get him!
Kill him.
Zorro! The legend has returned!
I need sanctuary, Father. You don't know me-- Zorro! Of course I know you.
Zorro, is it really you? The years have been kinder to you than to me.
I have no time to talk now. Father, please, hide me.
Come.
It's just like the old days.
Padre, is that you?
Is everything all right? It sounds like there is a battle going on.
Don't worry, my dear. You are safe in the house of the Lord.
Of course, Padre. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
Of course, Padre. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been three days since my last confession.
How many sins could you have committed in three days?
Come back when you have more time, please.
-Excuse me? -Listen, señorita....
Please, go on.
-I broke the Fourth Commandment. -You killed somebody?
-That's not the Fourth Commandment. -Of course not.
In what way did you break the most sacred of Commandments?
I dishonored my father.
That is not so bad. Maybe your father deserved it.
-What did you say? -I said, tell me more, my child.
Well, I try to behave properly, the way my father would like me to.
-But I'm afraid my heart is too wild. -Too wild?
-Yes. -Could you be more specific?
I had impure thoughts about a man.
I did. I think he was a bandit or something. He wore a black mask.
-He had a deep voice? -Yes.
-Ruggedly handsome? -His face was half-covered.
But something in his eyes captured me. Captured you.
I felt warm and feverish.
Lustful?
Yes, lustful.
Forgive me.
I forgive you.
Look over there, by the altar.
Search everything. The chapel, the loft, the rectory, all of it.
This is a house of God. Don't worry, Padre, we'll be gone by the time he gets back.
Señorita, you have done nothing wrong.
The only sin would be to deny what your heart truly feels.
Now, go.
Elena.
-What are you doing here? -I was confessing.
-Confessing? -Yes.
To whom? The priest is here.
Stand back, Elena. Please.
Out of respect for Miss Montero, I'll deal with you later.
Horse! Come here.
Blackie! Thunder! Storm!
Stupido! Get over here now!
I warn you. I'll get another horse.
So?
What do you think?
Sir, I got the black stallion, I carved a "Z" in the--
The people will be speaking the name of Zorro again.
You think stealing a horse makes you worthy enough to wear that mask?
Be careful.
You're a thief, Alejandro. A pitiful clown.
Zorro was a servant of the people, not a seeker of fame like you.
A buffoon.
-Zorro did what was needed. -Now he is needed again.
I didn't ask for your help in the cantina...
...but I came here to learn how to fight like you.
To have your strength, your courage.
Now when I try to use them, you slap me down?
Let me tell you something. I am tired of all your training, your lecturing.
I am tired of waiting for you to tell me I am ready.
I have my own scores to settle, a new life to find.
I thought I could do it here, but I was wrong.
Alejandro!
En garde!
Choose your weapon.
Montero has invited every don in California to a banquet.
If you want to be of service, you can join them as a spy.
I think I do not understand, sir.
You have passion, Alejandro, and your skill is growing.
But I must give you something which is beyond your reach.
-Yes? What is that? -Charm.
And what is that?
Convince Montero that you are a gentleman of stature...
...and he will let you into his circle.
Me?
A gentleman?
This is gonna take a lot of work.
Yes.
Look at me. I look like a butterfly. This is the most stupid thing I've ever done.
-I doubt that. -We'll never get away with this.
Yes, we will.
A nobleman is a man who says one thing and thinks another.
What if Montero realizes who you are? Montero thinks of himself as a true nobleman.
He will never look a servant in the eye. Listen to me.
Listen to me!
Most important thing of all... ...do not let the dons leave the table without you. Yes, sir.
-Good luck tonight. -Thank you.
Stand up straight. Charm.
Charm.
Don Rafael Montero? Good evening.
I am Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia.
The formal Spanish greeting. I have not seen that in years.
-My father was very strict. -Who is your father?
Don Bartolo del Castillo. I have heard of him, but never had the pleasure of meeting him.
I arrived last week from Spain by way of Paris, Lisbon and San Francisco.
I am inspecting my family's holdings.
Queen Isabella of Spain has been very generous to us.
Very impressive. What brings you here?
I heard you were back in California and knew I must introduce myself.
Her Royal Highness speaks very highly of you.
Really?
I thought I fell out of favor with the court when California was lost.
Only in certain circles.
Her Majesty knows those unfortunate events were clearly no fault of yours.
She told me this is still a land of opportunity for a man of vision.
-And you are a man of vision? -I am a man in search of a vision.
But my timing is unfortunate. I have interrupted a party. Perhaps I could call again?
No, it would honor me for you to join us.
No, it would honor me to do so, sir.
Please allow me to introduce my daughter, Elena.
Charmed.
I'm afraid I have brought no gift for the hostess...
...but wait a moment.
-Thank you. -A pleasure.
Bernardo, pick up your feet. Señorita. Caballero.
Don Alejandro.
My father and I would like you to join us at our table.
I would be delighted, señorita.
Don Alejandro, I'm so pleased you could join us.
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia. Recently returned from Spain.
This is Captain Harrison Love. Not a don, but a kindred spirit.
Are you not the man who was chasing a legendary bandit recently?
-He was hardly legendary. -So you caught him?
-It's only a matter of time. -The bandit may have escaped...
...but the rest of us will think twice before going to confession.
Thank you.
With all due respect, Don Hector, I disagree. Until these people are free to govern themselves...
Until these people are free to govern themselves... ...I think we will see many more Z's carved into walls.
Don Alejandro, what do you think?
I think sheep will always need a shepherd.
But certainly not this Zorro creature.
He probably wears the mask to hide his bald head and unsightly features.
-Some would call him heroic. -Heroism, a romantic illusion.
-Much like nobility. -Elena, that is enough.
I would think heroism is something to aspire to, not sneer at.
All that playing swords, shooting guns, racing around on horses...
...gives me a frightful headache. Such sweaty pursuits are hardly the work of a gentleman.
And what is? Climbing in and out of carriages?
No, my dear.
But increasing one's holdings so as to provide lavish comfort for ladies.
Such as yourself.
A woman's grasp of politics. What can I say?
We're at a party, aren't we? May I have the honor of this dance?
I would be glad to.
Yes? Were you looking for something?
A sense of the miraculous in everyday life.
Oh, really? Look someplace else. The lady and I were trying to dance.
You were trying. She was succeeding.
Forgive me, captain. A shameless joke at your expense.
I hope it will not be the last. Don Rafael wants you back. Now.
Should we try something more robust, or do you feel unequal to the task?
No, on the contrary.
I think only of your distaste for perspiration.
Well, that is the way they are dancing in Madrid these days.
Excuse me, Don Rafael, I need to catch my breath.
Your daughter is a very spirited dancer.
"Spirited." Thank you for putting it so delicately.
I apologize if you're offended. No, no, no. Completely unnecessary, I assure you.
She is young and impulsive, but her beauty is beyond compare.
And she has her father's commanding presence.
Don Rafael.
As an advisor to Her Royal Highness in matters of finance...
...it would be my pleasure to introduce you both at court.
Join us in the courtyard. There is something I want to share with you.
What is that?
A vision.
Fellow dons of California...
...all of us can recall the golden years when we ruled this country.
We commanded respect and amassed a great deal of wealth.
But there was something that we never achieved. We never determined our own destiny.
Well, the time has come to claim what always should have been ours.
My friends...
...I give you the independent Republic of California.
Don Rafael, every man here owes you something. The land you gave us made us all wealthy men.
However, we must question your motives.
The day you arrived, you made us look like fools.
That is absurd, Don Pedro. I was merely playing to the crowd.
And what are you doing now if not playing to the crowd?
You're inciting us to raise arms against Santa Anna.
You know perfectly well we could never defeat his army.
I was not suggesting that we fight him for California.
I was suggesting that we buy it from him.
Santa Anna is waging an expensive war with the United States... ...and is increasingly short of money.
Even if we all combined our fortunes... ...we could not come up with enough to buy this country from Santa Anna.
I have already brokered a deal with him. You are living in a dream.
And why don't we all live in the same dream together?
Meet me here tomorrow morning for a journey...
...that will open your eyes and lay all your doubts to rest.
My friends, I give you El Dorado!
Technically, of course, all this gold belongs to Santa Anna...
...but, fortunately for us, he's completely unaware of its existence.
For the deception to work, these bars have been marked... ...with the Spanish seal so he'll think they're from Spain.
You see now, gentlemen? Is it becoming clearer to you?
Two days from now we will buy this country from Santa Anna.
We will buy it with gold dug from his own land.
-Where did you find all these people? -Anywhere we wanted.
Brilliant.
Brilliant.
It's only part of the mining process. First we picked it up off the ground, now we're down to blasting.
So this is the future of California?
This is my vision, yes.
Up here. Well, now, ain't you a sight for sore eyes!
Full-grown vultures walking around like real folk.
Welcome. Welcome to hell's outhouse.
They call us the disappeared ones, but we ain't exactly disappeared.
-We're just hard to find. -Wait! You. I know you.
You bet you do, peckerwood. I'm the legendary Three-Fingered Jack.
And you are a bunch of murdering trash...
...dressed up in fancy, sweet-smelling doodads.
Ignore him, gentlemen. He's a common thief.
As common as they come. But I ain't nothing compared to you gentlemen.
But I ain't nothing compared to you gentlemen. I steal gold, I steal money.
But you steal people's lives.
So damn you! And damn the horse that brung you.
Peckerwood?
Is there something amusing, captain?
Strange, I'd say.
It's the second time I've shot this man while he was flying through the air.
Don Alejandro! I need to speak with you at the hacienda, alone.
-Some other time, perhaps. -Today. Alone.
Good afternoon, Bernardo.
Good afternoon, señorita.
Your voice is so calming. He's high-spirited. He needs to hear something soothing.
Yes, I understand.
How long have you served Don Alejandro?
Sometimes it seems interminable. Sorry, I speak out of place.
Do not worry, Bernardo. He will not hear it from me.
Don Alejandro confuses me.
Sometimes he seems so arrogant, so superior.
And yet the way he looks at me and the way he dances with me....
As if he were two completely different men.
Yeah.
You look so much like your mother.
How would you know that?
Well, I don't see much of Don Rafael in you.
I know my father wishes I acted more like her.
She was very proper, my mother. Always appropriate Is that how he describes her?
-Yes. But I do not believe him. -She was more like you.
Perhaps. It would be a way of knowing her.
My niñera told me that the departed can see you in the moonlight.
When I was young I sneaked out at night and rode across Andalusia.
I would wave at the skies so she would know it was me.
-How did she die? -Giving birth to me.
My father rarely speaks of her. I think he finds it too painful.
Yes.
I know what it is like to lose a loved one.
You?
Yeah. A daughter. Long ago.
When I see you, I remember what it felt like to be a father.
-Your mother would be proud of you. -Thank you.
Bernardo, I have to ask you, have we ever met before?
No, why would you think that?
I do not know. It's strange, your voice seems so familiar.
I haven't been to Spain since before you were born.
Of course.
Well, it's a very pleasant voice.
Thank you.
-Good day, Bernardo. -Good day...
...Elena.
Did you know that the Compa Indians of central Peru...
...used to cannibalize their enemies in order to absorb their power?
The eyes in particular were most sought after.
To be able to see through the eyes of an enemy is a valuable thing.
Where are my manners? Would you care for something to drink?
No?
A different vintage perhaps?
You're a very sick person, Captain Love.
Heads in water jars, hands in wine pitchers...
...must strike you as odd, I suppose.
Well, for one thing, I think you ought to fire your housekeeper.
-Who is he? -An enemy.
He has a brother out there who will share the same fate.
I wish you luck.
-To your health. -Murrieta's brother or not...
...you are more than you pretend to be.
Maybe someday I will see what I look like through your eyes...
...Captain Love.
Oh, it is beautiful.
Excuse me. How much does it cost?
It is a gift, she says, in honor of your mother.
My mother?
-She loved your mother. -She must be mistaken.
My mother died long ago in Spain.
She says there is no mistaking... ...the daughter of Esperanza and Diego de la Vega.
She says she was your nanny. She hung flowers on your crib.
I'm sorry, I cannot accept it.
Alejandro.
Listen to me. Can you find your way back to the mine?
No.
The carriage windows were all covered.
-He didn't even trust his own dons. -Nor would I.
You must go to Montero's house tonight. Break into the chest in his study.
-Find out what his plans are. -People in the mine are dying.
And all I can think of is Captain Love.
He will come into your circle soon enough.
-I miss my brother, sir. -Your brother is dead.
We lose the ones we love. Put it aside.
How?
How can I do what is needed...
...when all I feel is hate?
You hide it.
With this.
Santa Anna has agreed to the transfer at noon the day after tomorrow.
He insists we deliver the gold five miles north of town.
Captain Love?
It's a safe distance from the mine. The bars are stamped and ready. I don't foresee a problem.
Tell him we agree. You have done well, Luiz. Very well.
To the independent Republic of California.
Don Rafael!
You sent men to the hills? Doubled the guard at the wall?
Yes, yes, of course.
-After all, it's only one man. -It isn't just one man. It's Zorro.
And he knows about the mine. Otherwise he wouldn't be here tonight.
-How could he possibly--? -It doesn't matter how.
You don't seem to grasp the situation.
If Santa Anna finds out about this he will have us butchered.
Do you understand?
Then we should destroy the evidence.
Set explosives. Bury the mine.
-And the workers? -We destroy all the evidence.
No witnesses.
Make sure those papers are locked up.
Guards!
-The much-debated Zorro. -No. The legendary Zorro.
Put down your weapons! Tell them.
Do as he says.
Allow me.
Come. Stop.
Face the window.
Now, bend down and touch your toes.
Bend over!
Excuse me, Captain Love. Thank you.
Kill him!
Good morning, señor.
-Good morning, señorita. -Give it back.
-What? -Whatever it is you have stolen...
...from my father, I want it back. Give it to me.
No.
Come on, now.
I don't have the time to give you the proper instruction.
I have had the proper instruction since I was 4.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
This will make it more difficult. Señorita....
Don't move.
-Do you surrender? -Never.
But I may scream.
I understand.
Sometimes I have that effect.
Excuse me.
Goodbye, señorita.
What are you doing? What happened?
Zorro. Zorro was here. I fought him and he left. He left.
-Did you recognize him? -No, but he was young and vigorous.
-He was very vigorous, Father. -Vigorous?
Yes.
Let's go!
Go!
Here. This is the canyon. That is where the mine is.
They have 25, 30 guards at most.
-Nothing that Zorro can't overcome. -I'm not going with you.
What?
I'm not going with you.
There's something I must do. It's a personal matter.
-What about the prisoners? -There's nothing more I can do.
-You mean, nothing you will do. -I gave my life to them.
In return, I lose everything. My wife was murdered before my eyes...
...and my child was stolen to be raised by my mortal enemy.
Montero?
Elena.
She's your daughter.
Yeah, she was.
So...
...you will simply take your revenge.
No, I will take my daughter. And don't pretend she means nothing to you.
She does. But you taught me to see beyond personal feelings.
-Was that all a lie? -You're too young to understand.
To understand what? Betrayal?
All the work, all the training, all the wise words, for what?
To smile in the face of my brother's killer while you make your own plans?
Alejandro, I taught you everything you need to survive.
Now I must look to my own heart.
Elena is all I have left. I am not going to lose her again.
What about California? What about the people?
They still have Zorro.
I have every inch of the countryside covered. If he shows himself....
-Are you all right? -Do you have the map?
-We'll find it. -Is your army ready to fight?
-No, sir. -Then of course I'm not all right.
I'm beginning to wonder if you want this operation to succeed at all.
-What are you saying? -What I'm saying, captain...
...is that I think my horse could run this army better than you.
I said I'll find him.
That means I will.
Perhaps I can save you the trouble. Go on, reach for it, captain.
-Who are you? -I warned you long ago, Rafael.
-You would never be rid of me. -De la Vega.
Rafael. You were not the Zorro I saw last night.
-That was your master, Don Alejandro. -Yes.
But there are many who would proudly wear the mask of Zorro.
Either way, events have been set in motion that you cannot stop.
I'm not here to stop you.
Call for Elena.
Call her.
Captain, bring my daughter to me.
Bring her to me!
You cannot imagine, Rafael, how I have dreamed of this moment.
Night and day, 20 long years.
Really? I haven't given you a second thought.
-If I die, the truth dies with me. -We shall see.
Father!
-Bernardo, what are you doing? -Tell her, Rafael.
-Tell me what? What is going on? -Tell her who her real father is.
Father, what is he saying?
This unfortunate man lost a daughter once...
...and now he seeks to claim you for his own.
Tell her how her mother died.
Your daughter is lost, de la Vega. You cannot have mine.
De la Vega?
A woman in town, she told me....
Diego de la Vega?
Father?
His name is of no consequence.
I was told my niñera used to hang something on my crib.
Yes, she had her hang fresh flowers.
No!
No!
Let us finish it, Rafael. Let us finish what we started...
...the night Esperanza died.
Drop your sword or I will have no choice but to have you shot.
Even in the presence of my daughter.
Please.
They were flowers. Romneya.
Rafael...
...she knows.
Water!
Lock them up!
The fuses are burning. Hurry it up.
Let's go!
Wait here!
Secure the wagon, stay alert.
-De la Vega. -Rafael.
Only one question.
Really? What is that?
How would you like your remains displayed?
-Now I'm free to kill you. -No!
Drop the sword. Drop it.
You really think I would have killed my own child?
Did you miss me?
Elena! Get them out!
-"M" for Murrieta. -Two men. One dead.
You're doing well. Your brother would have shot himself by now.
Alejandro.
Is it finished?
Yes, Don Diego. It's finished.
Not for Zorro.
There will be other days, other battles to fight.
It is your curse and destiny.
My beautiful Elena.
The world is a strange place.
Too have found you at last only to lose you again. You will never lose me...
...Father.
You are like your mother.
Same eyes.
Same mouth.
Same spirit.
Alejandro...
...Elena.
And so it was. Lightning split the sky.
Thunder shook the air.
And then all was quiet.
The great warrior known as Zorro was gone.
The people of the land gave him a hero's funeral. The largest anyone had ever seen.
They came from far and wide to say farewell... ...to the brave and noble champion.
But don't worry, little Joaquin. Whenever great deeds are remembered...
...your grandfather will live on.
For there must always be a Zorro.
And someday, when he is needed, we will see him again.
On his fearsome steed, Tornado, riding like the wind.
His sword blazing in the sun.
Leaping, jumping! Swinging through the air! Fighting like a lion, fighting like a tiger!
Fighting...
...as safely as possible.
Is this your idea of putting the baby to sleep?
Sleep tight, my son.
When I sleep, I will dream of this dashing rogue, Zorro.
But what face shall I give him?
He has been many different men...
...but he has loved you as all of them.
How can I refuse such a man?
Do you know where I might find him?
covering the earth with water.
Those who survived have adapted... to a new world.
Bad luck, English.
But the Slavers are producing a good grade of poxy these days.
Cost you a handful of dirt. Or maybe that wind chime.
- What are you doin' here? - Just waiting.
Take your hand off the sail.
Take it off!
I've seen your boat before. Haven't seen you.
Took it legal.
Previous owner was dead on the tiller when I found it.
You had another hour before I traded up again. [ Laughing ] Just improving my means.
[ Laughing ] Just improving my means.
Well, I owe you then. No, thanks.
Well, I owe you then. No, thanks. I got all the supplies I need. Just came from an atoll.
I got all the supplies I need. Just came from an atoll.
Eight days east, if you're interested.
- Two drifters meet, something needs to be exchanged. - I know the code.
- Two drifters meet, something needs to be exchanged. - I know the code. But I'll give you this one for free.
Nothing's free in Waterworld. [ Laughs ] Yeah.
Smokers.
Just enough wind to get away clean.
[ Drifter ] Forget the bag.
It's not worth it. You'll never make it with your sails down. Hey! [ Laughing ]
What can I say? [ Laughing ]
- Joe, he's goin' for it. - What the hell?
Never seen that before.
Here we go! Go! Drive! Drive!
Faster! Faster! Whoo!
Come on! He's gonna get it! He's gonna get it!
Pick her up! Get it! Get it!
Oh, no!
Inbound! Straight out from the gates.
English.
Flag's down, drifter. We got enough traders.
Dirt.
Open the gates!
[ Man ] Bones to berries. Veins to vine.
These tendon to trees. This blood to brine.
Too old she was. This woman does leave us, recycled and enshrined...
This woman does leave us, recycled and enshrined... in the presence of him who leads us.
- [ Boys Wincing ] - What is that?
You know me?
I know what you are. Good. Then you know if you look for trouble while you're here,
Good. Then you know if you look for trouble while you're here,
you'll find more than you can handle.
You got two hours.
I'll only need one.
[ Boy ] He's comin' over here.
Me. You each get one... if everything's here when I get back.
Pure dirt. [ People Murmuring ] Three point two kilos.
How'd you come by so much of it?
Another atoll, 30 horizons west of here.
Where'd they get it?
They didn't say. [ Man ] We heard about that place--
They didn't say. [ Man ] We heard about that place-- heard they was all killed.
- That's why they didn't say. - Smokers?
Maybe Smokers, maybe Slavers.
So what's the word? We tradin' or not? We'll tally it like, uh, pure hydro.
We'll tally it like, uh, pure hydro.
Works out to... 62 chits.
I want twice that.
I just want one sip of hydro. No, not till you tell me.
She got inkings on her back. I seen her.
They say if you read the marks on the child,
they'll lead ya all the way to Dryland.
Dryland's a myth. Some still believe.
They say the Smokers even got an eye out for her.
Well, then, we better keep it to ourselves.
- Help you? - Yeah. Where's the store? You found it.
Where's the store? You found it.
You don't have much.
You the man with the dirt?
Skoal.
- One more. - Make it two.
A man this rich will buy for a fellow outwater, I'm sure.
One.
That's an interesting pair of boots you got.
Trade? No.
Shame.
Enola. Hey, what are you doing?
No, you can't have it. I need another piece. I want to draw some more.
I'll get it to you. Just stay in the back. With all those chits, you could order up a bath.
With all those chits, you could order up a bath. Have you ever had a freshwater bath?
Why are you talkin' to me? Just being friendly.
- Is that a tomato plant? - Yeah.
You have a keen eye.
Saw one in a picture. How much?
Half your chits.
I'll take them too. Take what?
I'll take them too. Take what? You bought everything. I'll take them shelves.
You bought everything. I'll take them shelves.
So, what did you see out there in your 15 months?
Such as? An end to all this water.
Such as? An end to all this water. Askin' the wrong person.
Askin' the wrong person.
The one they buried today? Uh-huh?
She found the only end there is.
I've got a proposition for you, Mariner.
I'm not staying. We're not asking you to. All we want is your seed.
We can look to our own for impregnation,
but too much of that sort of thing gets... undesirable.
When she's pregnant, you go on your way...
When she's pregnant, you go on your way... with all the supplies you need.
You don't have anything. You're dying.
No man stays out that long and turns down a woman.
He's hiding something. Maybe he's a Smoker spy.
When the elders say so, you can leave...
and not before.
Gills.
- Mutation! - He's a mutant!
[ Screaming ] My hand!
Throw the nets!
By what right--
You pay me to keep the peace.
This isn't it.
- He has killed one of ours. - He was defending himself.
- He needs to be destroyed! - Kill him.
That may be-- Let's kill him.
but not here and not like this.
[ Boy ] What is it?
It's tied. I can't get it off.
Open the gate.
Is it a map?
You'd tell me if you knew, wouldn't you, Enola? Mm-hmm.
- What are you drawing? - I don't know.
Helen, look. Look at the prodigal child's latest vision.
How soon before we can leave?
[ Man ] Helen, I don't have any idea yet where we can go.
I haven't figured out the tattoo on her back.
I'm a stupid man. The answer's right there. It's just beyond me.
Maybe he knows.
Oh, yes, I see. They are webbed.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten digits. That's wonderful.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten digits. That's wonderful. They tell me too that you have gills.
They tell me too that you have gills.
Isotropic gills. Are they merely vestigial or are they functional now?
My name is Gregor. I've just come to pay you a little vi-- vi--
Oh, my God. [ Laughing ]
I'm sorry. I'm not laughing at you.
I'm excited. Your gills. They're functional.
Ichthyus sapien. You can breathe in the water.
How deep can you go?
Look, I'm only here because I want to learn more about you.
You don't like humans very much, do you?
I can't say that I blame you. But tell me--
Are all of your kind as bad-tempered as you are?
- I have no "kind." - Oh, fish rot.
I'd be surprised if there weren't others, and if there aren't,
I'd be surprised if there weren't others, and if there aren't, there will be eventually.
Anyway, I've come here because I need to ask you a question.
Where-- Where did your dirt come from?
Is it from Dryland?
Do you know what this is?
The ancients-- They did something terrible, didn't they?
To cause all this water. Hundreds-- Hundreds of years ago.
If I tell you, will you open this lock?
I haven't a key.
There's a mooring cleat down there. What? Good as any key. A mooring cleat?
Good as any key. A mooring cleat?
I won't hurt anyone. I'll just leave.
- I'll be right back. - [ Man ] Gregor!
- I'll be right back. - [ Man ] Gregor! What's your business there?
Move along! I'm not a brave man.
If you know anything about Dryland, please tell me. Please.
Don't let it die with you. No, no, no, no. Stop!
No, no, no, no. Stop! [ Man ] Gregor! Move along!
[ Man ] Gregor! Move along!
[ Elder ] After considerable deliberation of the evidence at hand,
it is our decision that this mute-o...
does, indeed, constitute a threat.
Therefore, in the interest of public safety,
he is hereby sentenced to be recycled...
he is hereby sentenced to be recycled... in the customary fashion.
Proceed.
I'm sorry.
Bones to berries. Veins to vines.
His tendons to trees. His blood to brine.
Too strange for life, he was. This mute-o now does leave us,
This mute-o now does leave us, recycled and entombed,
Smokers! Dead out of the sun!
To your posts!
- Kill! - There!
We are safe behind these walls.
Aren't we? [ Man Shouts ]
- [ Indistinct Shouting ] - Let me out! Let me out! I'll fight!
Give me the key to the city now.
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Floor it! Floor it! Floor it!
Swab it! Swab it!
Goddamn! More ammo!
[ Smoker ] Break down the door!
We'll have this atoll in no time.
Crank it! Crank it!
Look!
Oh, no!
Keep that gas goin'! Fill 'em up!
- [ Gunfire ] - [ Gregor ] Helen, come quickly! Helen!
You're not supposed to go yet!
Infernal machine!
Gregor. Gregor, wait!
Helen, I tried. There was an accident. I can't make it stop. Hurry!
You can make it if you try. Run! Up the stairs. Run! Quickly! - Wait! Wait! - I'll throw you a rope. Run quickly!
- Wait! Wait! - I'll throw you a rope. Run quickly!
Throw the rope now. Run, Enola. Slow down! Wait!
Throw the rope. No! No! Wait!
- [ Enola ] Gregor, don't leave us! - Oh, no! I'm sorry! It was an accident!
I'm sorry! It was an accident!
Helen! Enola! Helen, I'm sorry!
Shoot him. Shoot him.
If I let you out of here, you're taking us with you.
Sure.
Enola, get down.
Here. Get over here. Get down. Hurry! Come on!
Get the gate.
[ Mariner ] Hurry up!
Kamikazes. Come on!
That made a hole.
Find her! Get the girl!
There!
Go get that guy! Go! Kill him!
Wow. Enola!
- [ Mariner ] You're too slow! - Run to the other side.
- [ Gunfire ] - Come on!
[ Shrieks ] Grab on! Hold on, hold on.
It's stuck! I can't make it through! - Let her go! - [ Gunfire Continues ]
- Let her go! - [ Gunfire Continues ]
Just drop her!
Turn the wheel. The wheel! Turn it!
That! Come on. Push it.
I am! Hurry! Now pull! Push it! Push it hard! Push it hard!
Push it! Push it hard! Push it hard! Okay, okay! Now pull this! Pull this!
Okay, okay! Now pull this! Pull this! Pull! Pull it! Hurry!
- [ Gunfire ] - Enola, jump.
Jump. Look at me. Jump! Okay. Now!
Well, excuse me! Did I say anybody could leave before the battle was over? Did I? No! No!
Did I? No! No!
Well, do somethin'. I hate sails.
Hey! Can you steer?
Can I trust you?
Answer me this, somebody. Why is that boat still firin'?
What's that cousin's name? Chuck.
- Hey, Chuck! - [ Smoker Leader ] He's pulling him right into us.
Maybe he doesn't answer to "Chuck." Call him "Charles." Charlie!
Stop him! Stop him!
Charles!
Adios, cousins.
She's here somewhere. Keep lookin'. [ Screaming ] Stop it! No! Let me down!
What you got? Couple of heartbeats over there. Aren't sayin' much.
If you'll notice the arterial nature of the blood comin' from the hole in my head,
you can assume that we're all havin' a real lousy day.
So here it is-- I need to know about that tattooed girl.
First one that tells me lives.
- I saw a girl. I saw, I saw-- - It was-- Sh-She had a big tattoo on her.
- I saw a girl. I saw, I saw-- - It was-- Sh-She had a big tattoo on her. She had lots of--
You won. Start over.
I saw a girl. I'm not sure,
but I think she got on a boat with three hulls.
The boat that cost me a thousand G's of go-juice? Yeah, the mute-o's boat.
- Mute-o? - Yeah. He got these slits here,
like-- [ Laughing ] like fish gills. He wasn't really a man.
He wasn't really a man.
A fluke of evolution.
Oh, I'm sorry. A fluke of, uh-- - Evolution. - I know!
- Evolution. - I know!
No! No, you said you wouldn't kill me! Did I say that?
- Witnesses, anybody, did I? - Yes, yes, yes! You said--
- Witnesses, anybody, did I? - Yes, yes, yes! You said-- You said it. Oh, I may have.
You said it. Oh, I may have.
I may have.
We get to the 'Deez,
tank up that sky boat-- send it out on patrol.
We gotta keep an eye out... for that ichthy-freak.
You been there, haven't you?
Dryland? You know where it is.
Yeah, I know where it is.
And, uh-- And we're going?
You and I are.
The kid we gotta pitch over the side.
- What? - My boat's tore up.
- What? - My boat's tore up. I'm takin' on water.
I'd be lucky to get half a hydro ration out of that.
You know-- I said I won't drink.
For 12 days?
No. It's better one of you dies now...
than both of you die slow.
Wait. Wait. We saved your life. We got you out. No, you got me out so you could get out. We're even.
No, you got me out so you could get out. We're even.
She can cook. She can fish.
So can I. Then take my necklace. Take my necklace.
I got better ones below. No, look!
I got better ones below. No, look! Oh.
After what you went through back there on the atoll, I can understand why you would want to.
But she's a child.
Is there something else then?
Enola! Go below.
Enola.
Yeah. You said so yourself. Been out there a long time.
Couple hours ago, I was potential dirt to you.
We're not like that. You all are.
Know what I was really thinkin'?
Why I don't drop both of you in my wake right now.
You got nothin' I need.
You're taking us to Dryland.
Killing's a hard thing to do well.
- Believe me. I'm not the one to start on. - Both of us!
How long you plan to hold that on me?
As long as it takes.
- Okay. - No!
Let me out! Let me out of here!
[ Indistinct Shouting ] Don't you touch my child!
Come here! [ Indistinct Shouting ]
Okay, now don't move, okay? There.
Oh. Oh, lookin' real good, yeah.
All done.
Now, there may be some small problem in depth perception.
Well, it better not screw up my short game.
- Well? - [ Smokers ] Looks good. I like it. Yeah.
- I like it better than your real eye. - Much better.
What do you say, Toby? The truth. Looks like shit.
That's why I love children. No guile.
It does look like shit.
And it feels like cold shit.
Deacon? What--
I'm sorry. It-It's just that there's a problem in the pit.
I'm sorry. It-It's just that there's a problem in the pit. Maybe you should come.
Maybe you should come.
- Let's drive. - [ Chattering ]
The pit. Don't bother with the scenic route.
[ Deacon ] Drive!
Hey, it's drivin' better.
Get off!
All right, all right, all right. Okay, okay.
You guys are great. Bless all you cousins over there.
Keep up the good work. Growth is progress. Growth is progress.
Somebody! Hey, up there!
Somebody! Hey, up there! Take it off!
- Yes. - Your Deaconship.
Hello. Good morning. Or night,
Hello. Good morning. Or night, whichever the case may be.
What is it? I'm a busy man. I thought you should know.
What is it? I'm a busy man. I thought you should know. We're down to exactly...
We're down to exactly... four feet, nine inches of black stuff.
Thank you, sir.
- How many G's is that after refinin'? - Maybe three refuelers.
- How many G's is that after refinin'? - Maybe three refuelers. We'll burn through that in two lunars. Sweet Joe!
We'll burn through that in two lunars. Sweet Joe!
We'll burn through that in two lunars. Sweet Joe! Will somebody please tell me what's happened to this place?
We outgrowed it.
All right. The only thing that is important is the tattooed girl. We don't spare any go-juice findin' her.
We don't spare any go-juice findin' her.
We don't waste it anywhere else. You cancel all those tractor pulls...
We don't waste it anywhere else. You cancel all those tractor pulls... and all that stuff until later. You got it?
You got it?
Dryland is the mother lode. [ Laughing ] On your toes.
Excellent.
- Hi. - Move.
[ Helen ] Enola. Enola, come here.
Come on.
Enola, come over here.
Hey! What are ya doin'? Decorating your boat. It's ugly.
What are ya doin'? Decorating your boat. It's ugly.
Where did you get this? From down below.
This is mine. You don't touch anything of mine.
I drew it for you. You don't draw on anything. You understand?
What--
This is my boat. I got it the way I like it.
You take up space, and you slow me down.
You know, she's just a little girl.
She doesn't know your rules. You wanna stay?
She doesn't know your rules. You wanna stay? You teach her.
Enola, what'd I tell you?
You're not so tough. You know that?
How many people have you killed?
Ten? Twenty?
You talk a lot. I talk a lot 'cause you don't talk at all.
Now how many?
- Including little girls? - I'm not afraid of you.
I told Helen you wouldn't be so ugly if you cut your hair.
In fact, you talk all the time. It's like a storm when you're around. Enola.
It's like a storm when you're around. Enola.
Hey! What are you doing?
- [ Enola ] Helen! - [ Helen ] You bastard! She can't swim!
- [ Enola ] Helen! - [ Helen ] You bastard! She can't swim! Help me! Helen!
Help me! Helen!
Helen, help me!
Helen! [ Sobbing ] Helen, help me!
Helen! Helen!
Hold on!
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.
Oh, please, come back. Please. Please. Oh, please.
Hold on. Okay, almost...
Thanks. I swear,
Thanks. I swear, if you ever touch her again--
You son of a bitch. Look at me.
You will go to bed that night, and you will never wake up.
Shut up. What?
[ Helen ] Smokers? Yeah.
Can't we outrun them?
[ Engine Humming ] Not with my sail down.
- What are you thinkin' about? - That's a nice touch.
That's them.
Don't hit the kid.
Coward!
Fuck!
No!
Cut it!
Come on! Come on!
[ Helen ] Oh, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. But you didn't give me much choice.
I'm sorry. But you didn't give me much choice. Oh, I know.
Oh, I know. But you ran away. I-- What?
But you ran away. I-- What? What are you do-- No! Please, no! No!
Don't ever touch anything on my boat again.
She said she was sorry!
That means you're supposed to say something back!
Did you say somethin'? [ Enola ] Mm-mmm.
[ Deacon ] The child-- Did he have the girl with him? - [ Pilot ] Uh-huh. - Seems to me if we launch now,
- [ Pilot ] Uh-huh. - Seems to me if we launch now, we can cut him down just about here.
If he doesn't change course. Ah, it's not likely.
He's a wily one, that ichthy-demon.
Yeah, if he knows he's been spotted,
he'll expect us to expect him to change course,
which is exactly why he'll keep his heading.
The important question is-- where's he heading?
And does he know how precious his cargo is?
I say that he's headed here, and we take him here.
Drifter? Mm-hmm.
[ Shouting Continues ] [ Helen ] Are we gonna stop? Look at the flag! His flag's up.
Look at the flag! His flag's up.
I thought you all stopped for each other.
Well, maybe he has some food!
Don't find many who follow the rules anymore.
Well, make it quick. What's your business?
Trade.
You got any resin?
Resin? He's gotta be out of his mind. He's out of his mind. I don't have any resin. [ Babbling ] You been outwater a long time, haven't you?
[ Babbling ] You been outwater a long time, haven't you?
Must be jokin' me, man. Resin! You don't got enough. How 'bout food?
How 'bout food?
Could you say that again, please?
- How 'bout food? - Ah, yeah, food.
- How 'bout food? - Ah, yeah, food. Yeah, that'd be good, eh?
I haven't eaten in, well, you know, forever.
Which one of you two is a cook then?
'Cause I usually fall for the waitress. [ Chuckling ]
Like you said, I don't have much.
Now listen, eh? Let's see. What do I have to do?
We can start with that wee orchard you got over there.
- [ Whooping ] - All right. Hold it there.
[ Mariner ] We can talk. [ Drifter ] Fair enough.
It's a nice rod, isn't it?
I like that rod. It's a nice rod. [ Babbles ]
Got yourself a wee harem goin' here now, do ya?
What you want for the women?
We're not for sale.
Not for sale? There's no such thing as not for sale.
Not for sale. Not for sale, eh?
Are they a pair or would you consider sellin' 'em separate? No.
Our business is done here unless you got some resin or sail you can part with.
I told you once already, I don't have it.
I-I-I don't have it. Don't have it. Don't have it.
Haven't seen neither for trade in lunars now. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
I do have somethin' that'll make you change your mind.
Somethin' that you can't pass on. [ Giggles ]
I took it off an Atoller refugee camp.
The life savings of the entire clan.
It's paper. Have you ever seen paper? Look at it.
Smell it.
I been savin' it for a special trade.
Don't you do it.
You know, maybe I'm talkin' to the wrong person here.
Whose boat is this? Is it your boat or your boat?
No. No, it's his boat. But he doesn't own us.
Half an hour.
Half an hour. [ Mumbling, Babbling ] Out of his mind somethin' there.
[ Mumbling, Babbling ] Out of his mind somethin' there. I got two pages in here, man. I mean, I'd get half a dozen girls with this, you know.
Half an hour. - You tradin' or not? - Don't.
- You tradin' or not? - Don't. Shut up.
Okay.
Forty-five minutes with the wee one right there.
I like to do the talkin', if you know what I mean.
No!
Fair. Come, come, come, come, come!
No. My boat.
- Fair enough. Fair enough. Good, good, good. Aye. - Helen.
- Sit down. - Enola, just do as he says.
It's been a while for me now.
Guess it's been more than a while, actually.
I've only got half an hour. Half an hour, half an hour, half an hour--
[ Mumbles ] Great, great, great--
[ Gasps ] Ooh. You're so beautiful. Aye. Anyone ever told you that?
Give me that. What are you doin'? It's just a game.
Oh, I, um-- I, uh-- We was just playin'.
The trade's off. I changed my mind.
Well, um-- Well, you can't do that. I mean, a deal's a deal, eh? I just did.
I just did. Hey!
She's mine. Aye. No. No, no. I own her. But-- No.
- Go on. - Get, get, get. Go, go, go. Good, good. But don't go too far now. This won't take but a minute.
But don't go too far now. This won't take but a minute.
I hate this boat. I hate this boat!
You bastard.
You-- You're pretty stingy for a man who's got everything, aren't ya now?
[ Drifter ] Ah, you bastard!
Where's me boat?
Where's me boat?
Help me to me boat.
You'd never catch anything with this. It's useless.
Look, I'm sorry. You were right about the pole.
You were right, but we have to eat.
Now I know you can hear me!
Now we can fish for ourselves. You show us what to do.
You must know how. Even you've gotta eat.
You just sit there.
What-- [ Mumbling ] I don't know.
Happy now?
You don't like my singing, do you?
Helen says you don't like my singing 'cause you can't sing.
- Ever try and listen? - To what?
The sound of the world.
- I don't hear anything. - That's because you're too loud,
and you're movin' around all the time.
Try sittin' still.
Eyeball?
I wish I had feet like his.
Then maybe I could swim.
Enola.
[ Burps ] Sorry.
Never met a person couldn't swim before.
I can't.
People said I was weird.
Maybe they were right.
Maybe they were right about you too.
Enola wanted to give you this.
And this.
She won't take it again.
You don't look much like her.
Well, I'm not her mother if that's what you're asking. You act like it.
What are those marks on her back?
Nothing. They're just fanciful things.
- Like what she draws? - She draws what she sees.
She's like a mirror.
People on the atoll thought she was a--
Freak?
Uh-huh. Yeah.
I just thought she was special.
I'm not givin' it to her. It's just-- A loan.
A loan.
Yeah. I'm not givin' it to her.
Is Dryland beautiful?
You'll see.
Enola? [ Laughing ]
Enola, what are you doing?
Those monsters'll kill her! No, they're asleep now.
Hands around my neck.
Let the water tell your arms and legs how to move.
We're goin' down. Hold your breath.
What is it? What is it?
The barter outpost.
You said we'd get to Dryland today.
Today. Tomorrow. What's it matter?
I need resin.
- What is that? - It's PortuGreek. Their own language.
Or so I thought.
There's my girl. Yeah.
Howdy, darlin'. Come on in here now.
What's going on? Smokers.
What the hell?
He's spotted us. Sound it!
Sound it! Sound it! Sound it! Sound it!
[ Helen ] Enola!
Starboard side! Now.
Get in the chair.
Watch it. He's clearin' the net.
Go to the helm.
Get the centerboard! Centerboard?
Get the centerboard! Centerboard? What centerboard? I don't know what to do!
It's too late. Over here!
No!
Gimme that rifle. Boy, if you wanna do somethin' right,
you've got to do it yourself.
I winged him. I say we load...
all the go-juice onto one boat and run the freak down.
You can't catch him in ten boats, and you wanna send just one?
Well, I pray that you're jokin'.
Bring me the trackers.
He's hurt.
It's not what you think. They weren't after her.
- I saw what I saw. - What?
No more lies.
- [ Shrieks ] - What are the marks on her back?
People say it's the way to Dryland.
Dryland's a myth!
No. You said so yourself that you know where it is.
You did.
You're a fool to believe in something you've never seen before. I've seen it. I've touched it! Dirt that was richer and darker than yours.
I've seen it. I've touched it! Dirt that was richer and darker than yours.
It was in the basket we found Enola in!
It doesn't exist! Well, how can you be so sure?
Because I've sailed farther than most have dreamed, and I've never seen it.
But the things on your boat.
"Things on my boat" what?
There are things on your boat that nobody has ever seen!
What are these shells?
And that reflecting glass?
And th-the music box? That--
Well, if not from Dryland, then where? Wh-Where?
You wanna see Dryland?
You really wanna see it?
I'll take you to Dryland.
Get in.
Well, what about Enola? There's only air for one.
Well, what about Enola? There's only air for one. Get in the water. It'll be all right.
Get in the water. It'll be all right.
Don't touch anything.
Okay?
I didn't know. All this time...
I didn't know.
Nobody does.
Can you get us outta here?
I'd say there are two chances o' that.
- Hey! - No way and no how.
Shoulda bought me that drink. Come on!
This way. Come on!
Proper introductions first. I'm the Deacon.
If you don't recall the face, perhaps it's 'cause I didn't always look like this.
Now-- [ Clears Throat ] I suspect she's somewhere real close. So we can tear this boat apart lookin' for her,
So we can tear this boat apart lookin' for her,
but I'd rather somebody just tell me where she is.
And the first one that does that lives.
And the runner-up-- Well, actually, there are no runners-up.
Oh, sweet Joe, I love this part.
Choose 'em. One, two. Live or die.
You know, personally, I'd rather shoot the sperm-of-the-devil here.
Huh? But you know somethin'?
I don't think you're gonna tell me, are ya?
Huh? Too bad.
Come on, eh? What do you say?
She's not your kind.
You don't even have a kind.
If you say it, he'll still kill us both.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
If you don't tell me,
I swear to Poseidon I will torch your boat.
Refresh my memory. What happens when neither one of 'em talks?
Never happened before. Never happened before.
[ Sighs ] All right! If they won't tell us where she is, do 'em!
Both of 'em! Just kill 'em now! [ Fires Gun ]
- No! - [ Helen ] No!
So gullible! Bring her here.
- Take and ye shall receive! - [ Helen ] No! Leave her! So ends your daily sermonette! [ Laughing ]
All we gotta do is figure out this map.
All we gotta do is figure out this map. Turn her upside down here, boys. Turn her up--
Turn her upside down here, boys. Turn her up-- Does that mean anything to you at all? No.
Does that mean anything to you at all? No.
[ Deacon ] We'll figure it out back at the 'Deez.
Back at the 'Deez, boys. Careful with her. Careful with her!
What about them? Do 'em both.
What about them? Do 'em both. Torch the boat.
We have to go under!
No, I can't breathe like you!
I'll breathe for both of us.
[ Enola ] Helen!
Helen, help! Helen! Helen!
My boat.
Enola.
What is this? Get those chains off her.
What is this? Get those chains off her. What are we, barbarians here?
What are we, barbarians here? Goodness gracious. Sakes alive.
Goodness gracious. Sakes alive.
Come on. Outta here, you big, nasty animal, you!
Rub-a-dub-dub. [ Chuckles ]
You wanna come over here and sit on my lap?
No? [ Clears Throat ]
How 'bout a cigarette?
Nothin' like a good smoke if you miss your mom.
Never too young to start.
No. Well, I got somethin' right here I know you'd like.
Like to draw, don't you? Huh?
Now they're yours...
if you help me with just one problem, all right?
Now-- [ Clears Throat ] Now that tattoo on your back-- [ Clears Throat ]
I've been told that, uh-- that's actually a map?
It's the way to Dryland.
Now we're gettin' someplace.
Could you teach me how to read that?
Setback.
Well, have you ever heard any of your friends talk about it?
You know, like your mommy or your pet fish? Did he say anything?
You shouldn't make fun of him. He wouldn't like it.
Girl, I don't give a shit what he'd like.
He took out my eye.
And if I ever see him again,
I'm gonna cut open his head, and I'm gonna eat his brains!
You think he'd like that?
You can't kill him. He's even meaner than you are.
But he's not here. And he ain't comin'.
And no one's gonna save you.
He'll come for me. He will.
Then you better tell me what I wanna know, or he can see what's left of you in a goddamn jar.
or he can see what's left of you in a goddamn jar.
We're going to die here, aren't we?
Aren't we?
After the atoll, when I offered myself to you,
why didn't you take me?
'Cause you didn't really want me.
Not really.
Have I been asleep long?
I was dreaming.
It's funny.
I always thought Dryland floated.
That it drifted with the wind. That's why it was so hard to find.
Why did you believe in it so much?
Because we weren't made for the sea.
Got hands... and feet. We're supposed to walk.
I miss her sound.
Don't you?
[ Gregor ] Helen! He-- No, no, no. Helen, up here. Above you!
He-- No, no, no. Helen, up here. Above you!
- [ Chuckling ] - [ Helen ] Gregor!
Smart thinking to burn your boat.
Without the smoke, I never would have found you.
Who's that with you? Ichthyus Sapien, is that really you?
Ichthyus Sapien, is that really you?
I'll throw the rope down. You catch it. I'll help you climb up.
Helen. Where's Enola?
Smokers took her. They'd have me too if it weren't for him.
My friend, thank you. Very human of you.
Go grab your things quickly. Quickly. Come.
[ Gregor ] You see? Right down there.
There's several of us survivors. We'll just start over again.
[ Man ] You can't ask us to go get her.
[ Woman ] Enola's the reason we're in all this trouble.
[ Woman #2 ] Forget it. We're not going.
[ Helen ] They don't have any reason to kill her.
They need to find Dryland just like we do.
- Of course. - [ Helen ] If the mariner's willing to go, why not us?
[ Woman ] If he wants to go, then let him!
[ Woman #2 ] We don't want you here! You or the girl!
Helen. The papers the mariner brought you--
It's the same language the tattoo is written in. They're numbers.
It's the same language the tattoo is written in. They're numbers. [ Man ] Gregor, you're as crazy as she is! [ Woman ] We can't stay here!
[ Man ] Gregor, you're as crazy as she is! [ Woman ] We can't stay here!
We're wasting valuable time. More Smokers will come. We need to be moving now.
My friends, don't you see we need this child if we want to find Dryland?
I'm not goin'. Nobody is.
[ Woman ] We've already seen their smoke on the horizon. Know what that is yet?
The numbers? Yes, I think I do.
It seems to be some ancient form of geographic location-- latitude, longitude.
It seems to be some ancient form of geographic location-- latitude, longitude. It doesn't make sense, though. The numbers, they seem to be backwards or something.
It doesn't make sense, though. The numbers, they seem to be backwards or something. It's upside down. The world?
It's upside down. The world?
The poles have reversed themselves?
I've been mappin' the cities below.
The world wasn't created in a deluge. It was covered by it.
- [ Man ] That's blasphemy! - [ Helen ] No, it's true.
- [ Man ] That's blasphemy! - [ Helen ] No, it's true. I've seen it with my own eyes. There is land. It's right under our keel.
I've seen it with my own eyes. There is land. It's right under our keel.
None of it's dry anymore. Some is.
None of it's dry anymore. Some is. Enola's been there. I know that now. I saw what she drew.
I know that now. I saw what she drew.
So that's why he's going after Enola-- to find Dryland.
I don't care about Dryland.
This is ridiculous. Going after the Smokers?
He doesn't even know which direction they came from.
[ Man ] I say let him go. [ Woman ] We're better off without them anyway!
If she's alive, I'll bring her back to you.
[ Woman ] Forget about the mute-o, Helen.
If he brings her back here, they'll kill us all!
I can't stand it. We gotta go help him.
I can't ask him to do this alone.
Oh, don't worry, my dear. You're not going to have to.
You got that tattoo figured out yet?
It would be easier if it was flat-- big and flat.
It would be easier if it was flat-- big and flat. It needs to be flat. What you got in mind?
It needs to be flat. What you got in mind?
Well, you cut it off her back. You stretch it, mount it.
Give us a proper look. Take her down below until I holler.
Saint Joe, we're close.
After centuries of shame.
They're gettin' ugly. Don't I know it.
Announce me, cousin.
[ Microphone Popping ] Hey. Here he is. [ Crowd ] Deacon!
Rise up, brothers and sisters.
Turn your eyes and open your hearts... to your humble benefactor,
to your humble benefactor, your spiritual shepherd and dictator for life,
the Deacon of the 'Deez.
Look out! It's mine! It's mine!
Children. Children of the provider.
Citizens of the good ship. Please now, hear me speak.
I've had a vision. [ Man ] Yeah, we're tired of your visions!
What about the land you promised us?
[ Crowd ] Yeah! Yeah!
[ Deacon ] O ye of little faith.
I've had a vision so great...
that as it came to me, I wept.
- And in this splenditudinous figment of wonder, - Is that Bone's ride?
- And in this splenditudinous figment of wonder, - Is that Bone's ride? - Is that blood on the seat? - I saw--
- Is that blood on the seat? - I saw--
And you know what it is that I saw.
I saw... the land.
- Horse, that you? - [ Engine Revving ]
Look, just bring it in slow, okay? I don't have all day.
- [ Engine Revs ] - Horse! Just bring it up slow.
I said slow! [ Screams ]
Shouldn't be doing that. You're gonna get in trouble.
Ha. That's right. You're not afraid. You've got your pet freak comin' to rescue you.
You're not afraid. You've got your pet freak comin' to rescue you.
He's not a freak, and he can take you anytime.
He's killed dozens of people, and he doesn't have any mercy or anything. He even kills little girls.
He even kills little girls.
Haven't we all?
Shit. It's Horse.
Find him. Find him! Come on!
- [ Crowd Chanting ] - Yes! Yes! Yes! Come on. Gettin' nervous, aren't you?
Come on. Gettin' nervous, aren't you?
I don't get nervous.
[ Deacon ] And if there's a river, we'll dam it.
And if there's a tree, we'll ram it.
'Cause I'm talkin' progress here.
Yes, sir. I'm talkin' development.
[ Man ] Yeah! For we shall suck and savor... the sweet flavor of Dryland.
the sweet flavor of Dryland.
[ Crowd Whistling ] [ Enola ] Face is all red.
Helen said with anybody that has a face that red, he's either had too much sun or too much to drink.
he's either had too much sun or too much to drink. All right, that's it. I'm gonna burn your face. Almost time.
All right, that's it. I'm gonna burn your face. Almost time.
- [ Clanging ] What's up? - We're just talkin' about our friend.
[ Doctor ] What's his name? [ Enola ] He doesn't have a name.
[ Doctor ] What's his name? [ Enola ] He doesn't have a name. So death can't find him. Nah-nah-nah.
Doesn't have a home or people to care for.
He's not afraid of anything, men least of all. He's fast and strong like a big wind.
He's fast and strong like a big wind.
He can hear a hundred miles and see a hundred miles underwater. [ Gagging ] He can hide in the shadow of the noon sun.
[ Gagging ] He can hide in the shadow of the noon sun.
He could be right behind you, and you won't even know it till you're dead!
Give it a rest.
He'll come for me. He will. [ Deacon ] We are the reason-- Yeah?
Well, I hope he does. [ Deacon ] The Lord's creation.
Remember you said that.
[ Deacon Continues ] Look at us. Look at us here today. [ Man ] Yeah!
Dryland is not just our destination,
- but it is our destiny! - [ Cheering, Whistling ]
Find him. Find him!
How can I find... this glorious place?
And he said to me--
"A child shall lead you."
A child.
- And behold! - It's time.
The instrument of our salvation!
[ Deacon ] Our guide in the wild. [ Deacon ] Our beacon in the darkness.
Turn her around, Nord.
She has shown me the path!
And before the holy-most moment is upon us,
let's sacrifice one to old Saint Joe.
And let's get this tub of shit up to speed.
Pull! Pull! Pull!
- Pull. - Pull!
So which way we rowin'? I don't have a goddamn clue.
[ Laughs ] Don't worry.
They'll row for a month before they figure out I'm fakin' it.
But, um, wh-wh--
Oh, you want details. Well, I'm not tellin' these savages...
Oh, you want details. Well, I'm not tellin' these savages... that we haven't solved the map yet.
I promised them results, and I'll get 'em if I gotta cut 'em out of her goddamn back.
Who is that? Who is that?
Maybe one of the spare rowers?
Why aren't you rowin'?
- It's him. - It is him.
You guys are in so much trouble.
Well, I'll be damned. It's the gentleman guppy.
You know, he's like a turd that won't flush.
I want the girl.
You know,
I thought you were stupid, friend.
[ Gun Cocking ] But I underestimated you. You are a total freakin' retard.
You are a total freakin' retard.
I want the girl. That's all. Well, what on this screwed-up earth makes you think you're gonna get her?
Well, what on this screwed-up earth makes you think you're gonna get her?
You know what this is?
I drop it, you burn.
We all burn. Now wait, wait, wait, wait.
We all burn. Now wait, wait, wait, wait. [ Clears Throat ] Let's not do anything rash here. I mean, uh, are you sure she's worth all this?
I mean, uh, are you sure she's worth all this?
She never does stop talkin'. She never shuts up.
I noticed. What is it then?
I noticed. What is it then? Huh? It's the map.
She's my friend.
Golly gee. A single tear rolls down my cheek.
I mean, you're gonna die for your friend.
If it comes to that.
- He's bluffing. I'll kill him. - He's not bluffing. He never bluffs.
Shut up!
I don't-- I-I-- I don't think you're gonna drop that torch, my friend.
- Why not? - Because you're not crazy.
Oh, thank God.
Get him!
Let's go, goddamn it!
Don't just stand there! Kill somethin'!
Was this your big vision?
[ Yells ] I've always wanted to drive this monster.
There he is! There he is!
That's him! There!
[ Enola ] No! Let go!
[ Enola ] Let go!
[ Enola ] Let me go! Let go! [ Deacon ] Pilot!
- [ Deacon ] Pilot! - [ Enola ] Let me go!
[ Mariner Cocking Gun ] Let go! Let go-o-o-o!
[ Laughing ] You should've stayed underwater.
Now you know how to fly an airplane? You're lucky I do.
Ow! Now you stop it! You behave yourself now!
[ Helen ] It's going down. You can see it sinking. Gregor, bring us right down on top of it.
You can see it sinking. Gregor, bring us right down on top of it.
Hurry, Gregor! [ Gregor ] Don't worry.
Hurry.
Enola! Up here! Grab on!
[ Gregor ] Are they on yet?
- [ Gregor ] What is it? - [ Helen ] I don't know!
Gotcha! I'm gonna rip your cute little lungs out.
Pull! Almost.
[ Shrieks ] [ Helen ] No! - [ Enola Screaming ] - [ Helen ] No! Enola!
Saint Joe. Hole in one.
- Helen! - [ Helen ] No! Enola! - [ Gregor ] Helen!
- Helen! - [ Helen ] No! Enola! - [ Gregor ] Helen! Hey! Hey!
Oh. Oh, no! Quick! What are we gonna do?
Tie this off.
- [ Gregor ] Hurry! - Tie it!
- Got it! - [ Enola ] Ah!
Get 'em up now.
- [ Gregor ] Of course! North is south. - What? - South is north. - I was swimming.
- South is north. - I was swimming.
I saw. [ Gregor ] My friends.
I saw. [ Gregor ] My friends. My friends, look.
If I take a bearing from the sun and reverse the coordinates on Enola's back,
then Dryland is that way.
[ Helen Laughing ] It's fresh! All of this! It's fresh!
I found something!
Maybe we should put them under the dirt.
I think it was their way.
[ Gregor ] They must have known they were dying.
I'm home.
Where's the mariner? He was outside.
Wait. Wait! I want to show you this.
First time in your life you got nothin' to say?
Enola, I have to go now.
But you came back for me.
I like you.
Why are you leaving?
I don't belong here. I belong out there. You belong here.
It's too strange here. It doesn't move right.
Helen said that it's only land sickness.
...at 102.7, WNEW-FM, where rock lives.
Beautiful autumn day in the city...
...and a great record coming your way too.
Ben!
Ben!
Ben!
Get up, get up, get up! Late, late, late!
Ben! Come on, honey. Get up. We're seriously late.
You may think this is funny, but this is so not...
...funny.
I'm not kidding anymore. You make yourself appear right this instant.
Ben?
Ben!
The clock is ticking, Ben! Come on now!
Ben!
Anna?
Oh good, you're already up.
You forgot to wash my shirt. Today is purple shirt day at school.
I didn't forget.
Actually, I was up half the night thinking about it.
Yeah, right.
I concluded that you are too special to look like everyone else.
So, orangey-red. That's your color. Few can carry it off.
-Help me find your brother. -You lost Ben?
No. I didn't lose Ben.
Ben!
Ben!
All right, Ben, fine.
You explain to your teacher why you're late.
Your daddy said he had an important case and had to go to work early.
And he left us here to be responsible--
Shit!
You're so not funny.
Not funny.
You're also late, and that means get dressed right now!
Stay. No, stay. Ben! Ben!
This is not funny!
We've got to get you dressed. We're running so late.
This is not a game!
Come on. Help me out. Ben.
Come on, Ben! Really, we're so late.
But I don't want to go to school.
No!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Hi, sweetie!
You look like you're having such a good time.
But we're running a little late.
-You're supposed to wear purple. -She forgot to wash it.
Hey.
What a hug!
I'll handle it from here, Isabel.
I'm sure you will, Jackie.
Oh, my gosh! She made you a lunch?
Okay, come on.
Mom, why are we listening to this classical stuff?
Because I like it, and I'm driving.
When you get a car, you can pick the music.
Why does Isabel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have her own?
I saw a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washing machine.
-Perhaps her underpants are there. -Right next to my purple shirt.
I'm never speaking to her again.
Never say never. Here's your vitamins.
She's always messing up my life.
It's not fair to say "always."
I hate her. She's such a witch.
No name-calling. Use your words.
I hate when you say that.
That's a beginning. "Hate" is an acceptable word.
Just be careful to use it only when you truly detest something.
Like what?
Well, like...
...Uranus. I hate that. It's a terrible name for a planet.
Uranus!
And the hokey-pokey.
I hate it. Putting your foot in and out at weddings. It's terrible.
I hate when you do that! I can smell your breakfast.
Point well-taken.
Ladies, let's just calm down. She'll be here.
Isabel, where are you? Come on. Any word?
She's on her way.
-She's on her way. I promise. -Oh, really?
How do you know?
I'm here! I'm sorry I'm late.
What a crisis!
White pants, black top? And the white or black bra?
And then I picked this....
-All righty. -I'm here. I'm lame.
You got a Froot Loop in your hair.
Get me a digital camera right now. Russell, get this out of here, please.
Come on, boys!
Why is she shooting this?
Isabel, we have been waiting for an hour.
I know. I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
Why are you shooting this?
Because I'm brilliant.
And I see something you don't.
So stand back and trust me, why don't you?
I trust you. But why are you shooting the craft service guy...
...when I've got 5 male models in expensive suits over here?
Thank you, ladies. Lovely. That's a wrap, everybody!
No, it's not a wrap!
She's kidding. You were kidding, aren't you?
I'm not kidding. And if you meet me here in an hour...
...I will prove to you why you hired me...
...even though I wouldn't sleep with you.
She's got such a great sense of humor.
Wait.
Let's see...
...if I can save...
...both our jobs.
-Interesting. -Look at that.
Wow! It's the little guy in the suit.
-What do you think? -I like it.
I like it. Good work.
I like it too. Very creative.
Thank you.
Congratulations, Duncan.
That suit takes pounds off of him.
While change is exhilarating for an adult...
...it can be quite a challenge for a child.
I won't get that.
It's fine.
Change.
You were talking about change.
The fact that you two are remarrying obviously has Anna overjoyed.
And she's excited about the move to Switzerland.
She said we are remarrying?
My concern is that Anna seems apathetic towards her work...
...knowing she's leaving before this semester.
-Mrs. Franklin, we are not-- -No plans on getting....
-Remarried. There's no move-- -To Switzerland.
-Really? -Really.
Well, then, my concern for Anna is that she--
-Are you here? -I'm here.
-You don't seem like you're here. -I'm here.
The judge is ruling on a motion that could make or break my case.
-But have I answered my beeper? -So turn it off.
I'm wondering if anything at home could be...
...intensifying Anna's need to create this fantasy.
I've been seeing another woman.
He's seen a number of women.
But I've been seeing one woman for the past year.
After discussing it with her and the kids, she moved in last month.
She's half his age.
-Isabel's not half my age. -We're not discussing your age.
When the children visit, they want to be with their father.
They want to be a part of my life. Isabel's part of my life.
Mr. Harrison, I hear you talking about your life, your needs.
But are you in touch with what Anna needs?
Anna needs a safe and loving home. What I'm trying to give her.
-That's what she already had. -I'd walk through fire for Anna.
Gladly. Any day of the week.
Except Thursday, when Isabel forgot to pick them up.
Jackie, she was 5 minutes late, for chrissakes!
She was 5 minutes late!
I wonder if Anna could be responding to the hostility...
...between your girlfriend and Mrs. Harrison.
Well, of course she's responding to it.
Do you think this is easy for us? Do you think it's easy for Jackie...
...to see her kids looked after by another woman?
Not to mention, a woman who really has no experience being a mother.
Of course Jackie's going to be irrational...
...hostile...
...defensive.
Thank you, Luke.
Why would I say...
...you're getting back together?
People make up stories about things they wish would happen.
Why would I want that to happen?
Okay, pick a card. Any card.
Because you're upset.
Because Isabel moved in and--
I'm not upset. I won't get myself upset over her.
Tear it in half.
Look, sweetie.
-If it means-- -Again.
-If you really-- -Again.
If you want--
And again.
Time out.
If you don't want to talk about this now, you don't have to.
But don't look at me and lie.
It hurts my feelings, I get angry....
You're only allowed so many lies before it shows in your face...
...and you wind up looking like....
Like who?
He's not President anymore, so why be petty?
I'm sorry I said it.
I guess sometimes I just....
Sometimes I do wish you and Daddy would....
Well, you know.
Yeah.
I figured if I said it out loud, it just might come true.
Yeah, I know.
It's not that I can't cook. It's that I choose not to cook.
-There's a big difference. -You don't have to cook.
Could we save some of the wine?
-I need it for the sauce. -Too late.
-Hi, honey. -Hi.
-You better get it. -Okay.
Hello?
Hello?
-Who's there? -Nobody there.
I missed you today.
I missed you too. I miss you every day.
How was your day, baby?
It was pretty good, except I got to go back to Pittsburgh.
Yeah, I got to go tomorrow till Sunday.
But I'll have to order in.
Well, we got the kids for the weekend, so I figured...
...that you and the kids...
...and me could all go...
...to Pittsburgh together.
Never going to happen.
No? Come on! We could get a great hotel room.
We could take in a baseball game or something.
-What do you think? -Pass.
All right. Then I'll call the babysitter.
What for?
Well, I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
What?
Can't handle them myself. That's what you mean, isn't it?
No.
Hello.
You don't trust me to be alone with your kids.
Yes, I do.
-No. -Of course I do. It's just that--
-What? -They're a handful.
Luke, keeping me apart from them is like saying:
"Kids, this is fun. Keep on hating her."
-They don't hate you. -Really?
Look in their eyes. Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Jackie's just protecting her kids. What do you expect?
It's complicated. You don't understand. You don't have kids.
Okay.
So it's just complicated for you and Jackie.
For me, it's pretty simple because I don't have kids.
I'm just trying to give you guys time to get used to living together.
All right then.
Back off just a little bit and give me a chance, okay?
Hello.
What is your problem, asshole?
You are my problem!
You're absolutely right, baby.
Your kids don't hate me. I'm just paranoid. Call your daughter.
I trust you.
Really?
I'll give you a chance if you still want it.
-I do. -Are you sure?
Yes.
Okay.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
Don't fight with me when I'm hungry.
How long will you be out of town?
Till Sunday morning.
I'm worried.
About what?
About being alone with her all weekend.
What if she burns the place down?
Just keep an eye on her...
...and make sure the fire extinguisher's handy.
-You ready to launch her? -Yeah.
Let's give her a good push.
Why did she move in with you?
Because we love each other and want to share our life together.
You already had a life with Mommy.
But Mommy and I weren't getting along very well.
And it wasn't fair to you guys, us fighting all the time.
I fight with Anna all the time.
Can I move out?
No. But you guys are brother and sister.
You were husband and wife. Doesn't that mean something?
Yes.
It does.
But....
Well....
When you get older...
...your relationships get a lot more complicated.
All kinds of feelings are flying around.
And sometimes...
...some of those feelings change.
But did you fall out of love with Mommy?
Well....
Yeah.
I guess I did.
I still love your mom.
It just....
It became a different kind of love, that's all.
We're still really good friends, and we always will be.
Can you ever fall out of love with your kids?
No.
That is impossible.
Like Mission: Impossible.
Exactly like Mission: Impossible. Get over here.
Powdered lizard brains.
Crushed werewolf ears.
And vampire eyes.
God!
Cool!
Check it out. Magic potion.
It's cocoa.
I put a spell on it. Whoever drinks it will go to sleep for 1000 years.
Whatever. Spill any on my drawing...
...I'll put you to sleep for 1000 years.
You guys. I have a surprise for you. Come over to the sofa.
Please.
With a little enthusiasm.
Sit down.
All right. And close your eyes.
Please. Okay.
Okay, now.
Don't open them until I tell you to, okay?
And open.
What do you think?
Will he eat my bunny?
Puppies don't eat bunnies. Anna, What do you think?
I'm allergic to dogs.
Your daddy didn't tell me that.
He doesn't know much about me. He's never around.
Why don't we name the puppy? Puppy needs a name.
I know. Isabel.
I beg your pardon?
He smells like you.
And I'm allergic to you too. It fits perfectly.
Why don't you name that puppy? I'll be right back.
Young lady, let's get one thing straight.
Don't touch my things!
I would really like it if we could get along.
-I don't have to listen to you. -Yes, you do.
No, I don't. You're not my mother.
Thank God for that!
What I meant, and perhaps I didn't say it well...
...is you have a great mom. You don't need another one.
But I would like to be treated with some respect...
...when you are in this house.
It's my dad's house.
Well, it's my house too.
This is my room. Treat it with respect and get out.
All right.
"Run, run, run as fast as you can.
You can't catch me, I'm the Stinky Cheese Man."
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? I made it especially for you.
Yes, of course.
The special cocoa.
Delicious.
"A little boy looked up and sniffed the air and said--"
No, now you're cheating. You skipped the part about the cow.
It's bedtime. Can't we finish in the morning?
No. We have to start from the beginning...
...and you have to read the whole thing. I can't sleep otherwise.
Okay.
"Once upon a time...
...there was a little old woman and a little old man...."
"Who lived together in a little old house."
Hey. You're onto something. Why don't you read to me?
"They were lonely.
So the little old lady decided to make a man...
...out of stinky cheese.
She gave him a piece of bacon for a mouth and two olives for eyes...."
Isabel? Isabel?
Isabel?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
What's the matter?
I...
...killed her.
Killed her! Killed her!
Killed her!
-Good morning. -It is 7:23.
You were supposed to be here at 6:30. She missed her riding lesson.
It's Monday. Her riding lesson's on Tuesday.
Except for the third Tuesday of the month, which switches to Monday.
And in November, when she rides on Thursdays.
It's not that difficult.
Don't you have an agenda book you can write all this down in?
May I have a cup of coffee, please?
We don't have coffee.
Good morning, Betty Ford.
Hey, monkey man. Hi, sweetie. How are you doing?
Anna?
Anna?
Sweetie, go change your shirt.
-What did you do to Anna? -Could you just back off a bit?
What happened?
Nothing happened.
Luke was in the shower this morning...
...and Anna sort of...
...walked in without even knocking.
I don't see why that would upset her.
I mean, people in our family...
...have taken showers before.
Well, I was in there with him.
And did either of you...
...talk to her about it afterwards?
No.
I thought it would be uncomfortable for her.
You mean for you.
A 12-year-old girl is coping with the fact...
...that her father is never moving back in here with his family.
She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time...
...and you think it would be better for her...
...if everyone pretends nothing happened?
I am so unbelievably sick of your imperious bullshit.
-I'm not June fucking Cleaver. -Don't use that language.
If life hits her hard and you want to have a 12-hour conversation...
...every third Tuesday of the month, go ahead, lady. I have a life.
And I don't? Because I have children?
Your problem is you are so self-involved...
...you couldn't be a mother.
Maybe the problem here is your daughter.
And that she is a spoiled, wiseass little brat.
Get out of my house.
Get out.
Are you sure? I didn't see that on the schedule.
I've got your Halloween costume. Let's see if it's the right size.
A hippie?
Didn't you say you wanted to be a hippie?
That was last month.
Okay, what do you want to be this month?
Elvis.
Elvis. What kind of Elvis?
You mean, like, black leather jacket Elvis?
Gold lamé Elvis.
Gold lamé Elvis.
That's pre-drugs, pre-chubby, pre-army, pre-bad movie...
...all of that Elvis?
Honey...
...when Daddy was...
...washing Isabel...
...in the shower, what did you think that was about?
Well, sex, of course.
Okay.
-Why does Isabel scream? -Scream?
During sex.
How do you know she screams?
I live in the same country.
-Why are you asking me? -Just checking.
I like to talk to you about stuff.
I like talking to you about stuff too.
So since Daddy's working...
...you want to do something on Saturday, just you and me?
Sure, but it'll have to be in the evening.
I'm helping Bonnie Lyons move into her apartment.
So you're going to be with...
...Isabel.
Again? That really sucks!
You'll be at a professional photo shoot in Central Park.
You guys are going to have a lot of fun.
Switch your hands. Top hand down, bottom hand up.
Dylan, can you take one step up? Just one big step.
Rapunzel, reach your hand out again.
Wouldn't it be cool if her hair came out of her armpits?
Sick!
-I think we can finish before lunch. -Okay.
We like this light. We'll try and get this in before lunch.
Come on! It's been 5 hours. We're hungry.
Yeah, we're starving.
Get yourself another ice cream. And I'll be done soon.
I promise.
We're rich!
Sleeping Beauty, wake up.
Where's your brother?
I don't know.
Ben!
Ben!
-What if he's kidnapped? -He's not kidnapped!
He's hiding! Ben!
-Maybe he's in the castle. -Good idea!
Don't touch me! You bring bad luck.
Ben!
Ben!
Ben!
Ben!
Ben!
Okay, watch very carefully.
Ben!
-Mommy! -Hi, sweetie!
Oh, baby.
-Are you all right? -I knew where I was.
-We found him in the zoo. -In the zoo? My God!
Hold his hand. Don't let him out of your sight.
I am so sorry.
I'm going to say this one time, so listen carefully.
That woman is to have nothing more to do with my children.
Our children.
Do you realize what could've happened?
How lucky we are the police found him, instead of some lunatic?
Don't make it any worse. Isabel feels terrible.
-It could've happened to anyone. -Not to me!
You've made mistakes. People make mistakes.
I won't watch our children...
...fall through the cracks of this arrangement.
-Just calm down. -I won't calm down! I'm going to a lawyer!
We promised we'd never do that.
We've broken a lot of promises.
Don't take this out on him.
It's my fault.
I'm so sorry.
But you're not making this easier on anybody.
It is not my job to make it easier for you.
My job is to care for the children, and they don't want to be with you!
I'm getting a court order, and you will never...
...be with these children again alone. Do you understand? Ever!
Mommy, it's not Isabel's fault that I ran away.
No, you're right. That was your fault.
It's her fault for not taking care of my son as if it was a priority.
Which means, her most important job.
Isabel's job is she works.
Mommies work too. They work very hard.
I work harder as a mommy than I ever did when I had an outside job.
Does Isabel make a lot of money?
People who think only about themselves often do make a lot of money.
I think she's pretty.
Yeah. If you like big teeth.
-Mommy? -What, sweetie?
If you want me to hate her, I will.
What do you want?
Anna left her soccer stuff at the loft. I figured she might need it.
Thanks.
Did you talk to the lawyer?
I have an appointment for the day after tomorrow.
Don't do this.
You'll tell me not to put the kids in the middle of a war.
I'm doing this for their well-being.
Partly.
And partly you're doing it because you're mad.
You know the kids aren't in any real danger.
This is about Isabel and you know it.
She made one mistake, but she's trying. She's learning.
Slugs have a faster learning curve. Trees, clams....
Give her some time, will you? Don't drive her away.
I'm supposed to care about her?
You're supposed to care about me, like I care about you.
Like you cared about me when you walked out?
You kicked me out!
You were gone before I asked you to leave.
Don't give me this shit! I was working, for God's sake!
I'm sorry. Look, wait a second. Don't....
Please don't do this thing with the lawyers.
The kids will be okay if we're okay.
I'd do it for you.
Okay. I'm going to give you one last chance.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Good night.
This is the one I like the best.
She's got a longing look.
-She's great. -He couldn't be more flexed.
He's holding his breath. C-14.
Don't you think this one is? The way he's leaning back?
Kill that music, please.
That's passive. This is dynamic. He's going to get that girl.
You're the photographer. You're the genius.
Anna's school is looking for Luke.
Hello.
No, he's not here. This is--
Are you sure you have the right kids?
Because Jackie Harrison would never forget to pick up her kids.
Are you absolutely sure it's them?
Okay.
I'll be right there.
I will pick them up. Thank you.
What? The clients will be here at 4:30.
I know, so I have to hurry. Don't worry. I'll be back.
And I will dazzle you with my punctuality. To the button.
Isabel, don't do this!
Hi, guys.
Barbecue. I know they're your fave.
How could she just forget us? I mean....
That's something you would do.
To tell you the truth...
...I did.
Your mother had to help a friend with...
...this emergency.
So she called me to switch days.
But I got caught up at work and just forgot all about you.
-Mommy! -Mommy!
My little chick!
How are you, sweetie? I'm sorry you got stuck. Were you scared?
-You must be starving. -Yeah.
Yeah? You hungry?
-You want a good meal? -Yeah.
How'd you do on your math?
Was it hard?
-Who is it? -It's Jackie. May I come in?
Sure.
I have another appointment this afternoon, and I....
I need somebody...
...to take the children to the park.
And have federal agents jump from the bushes...
...and serve me with a court order?
What's the sentence for giving second-rate care to minors?
Whatever it is, it's not enough.
I'm on thin ice already with my boss.
When I ran out yesterday, I thought he'd fire me.
I can get somebody else.
Wait. God!
I'll figure something out. I'll do it.
After-school snack. Refrigerate, if possible.
Band-Aids, Neosporin, hand-wipes, Kleenex, Tylenol.
Why not just bring the whole pharmacy?
Ben likes to be read to. You know Dr. Seuss?
Not personally.
Do you have a word limit you have to hit every day, or may I finish?
Here's their schedule, my beeper number in case of emergency.
If not, I'll see you at 5:00 at the park.
All I ask is that they are alive when I get there.
Jackie, I wanted to ask you...
...something.
There's a Pearl Jam concert on the 5th. I'd like to take Anna.
Is that a weekday?
I think it's a Thursday.
You want to take a 12-year-old to a concert on a school night?
I thought it would be something nice we could do together.
It's ridiculous. She's too young.
It spread?
But I did--
I did everything right. Everything I was supposed to do.
We found some cells in your lymph nodes. In three of them.
But you said last time that you got it all.
If you were wrong last time, you could be wrong--
The last time was a year ago.
We found a tiny lump, we treated it. We thought we got it all.
We were hopeful, but there were no guarantees.
But people--
We can beat it. I mean, people beat it all the time, right?
-Every day, more and more. -So what's the plan?
What do we do? Another round of radiation?
Chemotherapy.
That's necessary?
Let's give it our best shot.
Right. Okay.
I got to get the kids.
We'll discuss this at your next appointment.
You should share this with your kids and ex-husband.
How would their worrying make any difference?
Sooner than later...
...you need to.
-Jackie. -Okay.
-Think about it. -Okay.
Hi.
I see her.
-Hi. -Hi.
-Thanks for coming. -You're welcome.
-You look pretty. -Thanks.
Listen--
I'm glad you called. I want to tell you something too.
-You go first. -Let me have a drink here.
I'm going to ask Isabel to marry me.
I know you don't think much of her.
She's a special person.
She really is, Jackie.
Why are you telling me?
I want your okay.
-You don't need my approval. -The kids do.
Good evening. Would you and your wife care to look at the menu?
I'm not his wife.
No, thank you.
Give me a drink though, please. Whatever this is.
I think it's going to be hard for the kids.
I was hoping we could tell them together.
And that'd make it easier for the kids? Or for you?
You can't just decide to be a "we" and "us" whenever it's convenient.
-We are-- -We're over. We are over.
We are still their parents for the next 100 years.
Why?
Just tell me why you think this marriage...
...is going to work and ours didn't.
-What did you want to talk to me about? -Nothing. It's--
I think we have...
...quite enough to deal with just with your news.
Good morning.
Good morning, baby.
I've got something for you.
-You do? -Yeah.
But you have to wake up to get it.
Oh, okay.
-Hi. -Hi.
I'm awake.
You shouldn't have?
The first time I got married...
...we'd been together since college.
Marriage...
...just seemed like the next step.
It was just something that happened.
But I think for two people to really love each other...
...to really commit to each other...
...it has to be...
...an act of will.
Or a decision.
And I think two people have to live that decision every day.
Even when things are hard and you feel like giving up...
...you have to...
...hang on to that decision...
...that choice...
...to love each other.
Even if it's only by a thread.
I let that thread break once.
This time, it won't.
Will you marry me?
Yes. Yes, I will.
-Sweetheart, don't get upset. -I'm not upset. Why would I be upset?
No one asked me when you got a divorce.
No one asked if I wanted a new mother.
No one even asked me if I liked her.
If you don't care about keeping our family together, why should I?
Daddy and I tried very hard. Really, we did.
No, you didn't! All you did was name-call. I heard you.
You didn't even try to use real words.
Okay, buddy.
Baby, Isabel's not going to take my place as your mom.
No.
It's just that Isabel's going to be in your life...
...and hopefully, you can learn to accept her.
Sweetheart.
Honey.
You know, life is full of hard things.
Sometimes it isn't fair.
But you have a choice.
You can either take the hard things and make your life better...
...or you can make it worse.
Like how?
Like...
...trying to see the good side of Isabel...
...and what she brings to your father's life.
And to yours.
There comes a time in every family...
...when you've got to be there for each other.
Okay.
I'll be there for you.
How about you, buddy?
Yeah.
-You'll be there? -Yeah.
Damn it!
What's the problem?
Nothing.
It looks good.
I can't get the trees to look real.
Mind if I try?
I already messed it up anyway.
Let's see. First a little brush smooshing.
"Smooshing."
Very technical term.
Cool! Where'd you learn how to do that?
I took an art class when I was at NYU.
Why don't you give it a try?
It helps if you make that little....
Thanks.
You're welcome.
I was thinking about what you said about Isabel.
You know, seeing the good side of her.
And you're right.
She knows all about clothes and stuff.
And she knows every rock 'n' roll song ever written.
I mean, she's like a kid herself.
-Like a big sister. -Yeah.
-She knows the cool junk food places. -I'll bet.
Once you get to know her, she's kind of cool.
Yeah?
But don't tell her I told you.
-I just-- -It's our secret.
Thanks.
Ben, wait up!
Hey!
-Did you have a good day? -Yeah.
You're lucky because...
...you get to watch a tape. I'm going out. Colleen's baby-sitting.
-Yeah! Cool! -And you...
...are wearing makeup.
Well, no. Isabel gave it to me.
She put it on in the car, playing around.
You don't see that color in the afternoon, except on working girls.
Anyway, wash your face, because...
...you and I are going out.
On a school night?
Pearl Jam?!
-Mom, you are the coolest! -You only live once, right?
Isn't my mom the coolest?
It was a great idea. Thanks.
Have fun.
Chemotherapy. There's a day's dose stored here.
This is a portable IV. Feel it.
It's pretty light.
Nice and slim. You can wear it everywhere, play tennis, jogging....
-You can hide it under your clothes. -That's cool.
Side effects?
Some days you'll experience drowsiness, nausea...
...and other days you'll feel perfectly fine.
-Am I going to lose my hair? -Maybe.
Maybe not. It varies with each person.
Let's do it.
Good.
When?
I'm available tomorrow evening.
Tomorrow's bad. Spaghetti and meatball night.
Ben really looks forward--
Okay, tomorrow's good. Fine.
-Hello? -Hi, honey. How you doing?
Mom, I've been waiting for your call.
-You won't believe it. -What?
-I'm telepathetic. -You mean telepathic.
That's what I said.
I just discovered it today. I can read minds.
No way.
I just tried it with Dad and Isabel, and guess what.
What?
I always knew exactly what they were thinking.
That is incredible.
-Want me to read yours? -Absolutely.
-Think real hard about something. -I'm thinking.
-Close your eyes. -Okay.
Concentrate.
I am concentrating.
You're thinking about me!
That is amazing. What else?
You're wishing you were here instead of where you are.
That's for sure.
Where are you, anyway?
I'm in bed, with the flu.
And I'm green and barfing.
I knew that.
You're wishing you were here making me spaghetti...
...so I wouldn't have to eat Daddy's sucky lamb chop.
You're right about that.
-See? I'm pathatelic. -Telepathic.
That's what I said.
-Mommy? -Yeah.
-When am I going to see you? -Tomorrow after school.
I was wishing I'd see you tonight.
We'll have to have one of our dream dates and meet somewhere special.
In our dreams. Where haven't we been in a while? How about Disneyland?
Last time, the lines were too long.
Okay.
The beach.
Yeah.
On a hot summer day.
With gigantic waves.
And boogie boards.
And corn dogs.
Awesome.
Cool! All right, don't forget to put on your sunblock, okay?
It's a dream. You don't need sunblock.
That's right. I forgot.
-Mommy, you still there? -Yeah.
Ben? Time for dinner.
I got to go. See you tonight, okay?
All right.
-I'll see you in my dreams. -Bye, Mom.
I love you.
She doesn't have that killer instinct.
Defense, fall back!
Hey.
You feeling all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm great.
You look a little tired.
I hate when people say that. It's a polite way to say you look like shit.
-I didn't mean it like that. -I just have some things on my mind.
You've been really busy lately.
Are you...
...seeing somebody?
No. I wish that was the reason I was tired. I....
I've been spending time with my old boss...
...trying to decide whether I'll go back to Random House.
-Really? That would be great. -Yeah.
Oh, Ben. Easy, easy, easy.
Ben, Ben, be careful, sweetie.
You're a dead man, Captain Blood!
Ben! Ben!
That was cool.
-Sweetie, can you move your leg? -Yeah.
-Does it hurt? -No.
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
Can I still go to Tucker's party tomorrow?
Probably. But we must have somebody look at it.
We'll go to the emergency room.
-Five stitches. -Is he okay?
-He's fine. -He's not crying?
-Can I see my son now? -I need your insurance information.
I'll do this.
He's in 152.
-I don't see any broken bones. -You don't have any.
I'm very proud of you. You were awfully brave today.
It didn't hurt that bad. Besides, it'll be cool to show my friends.
Would you do me a favor?
Maybe. Depends what it is.
Will you ask Dad to give me a white dove for Christmas?
-We'll see. -Come on!
Every magician needs a white dove. A real one. They do.
That's a long way off.
I think we should talk to your mom and just see, okay?
-Does it hurt again? -Yeah.
Lay back.
Take a deep breath.
Will you sing me a song?
My mom always sings to me when I get hurt.
Okay....
Hard to think of a song on the spot.
If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
And ease my pain?
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the sea
For to ease your pain
-Feel better? -Yeah.
A little bit?
It puts a girl on the spot.
Hi. It's Jackie.
I just got a call from Random House.
They want me to meet an editor this afternoon.
But I won't get back in time to pick up Ben at Tucker's party.
Good. Great.
Ben will be happy too.
That you'll pick him up. Yeah. It's 4:30.
At 22 Williams Road.
Great.
Thanks.
How hard can this be?
Okay.
It's going to be okay.
-Directory assistance. What city? -Manhattan.
-What listing? -The number for Random House.
Hello?
May I speak with Jackie Harrison?
Mrs. Harrison's not here.
She has a meeting with the editor.
I'm picking up Benjamin from a party and I lost the address.
I need to speak to her a second.
I'm the senior editor.
I haven't seen Mrs. Harrison since she left Random House...
...eleven years ago.
Okay. Thanks anyway.
-Balloons. -I beg your pardon?
Look for a house with balloons. It never fails.
The kids will be there.
Thanks very much.
Hey.
Look at you. Come here.
Can you see me?
You had a good time?
-Hi. -Hi.
-Hello. -Hi.
Let's clean your shirt. How was Tucker's party?
-Good. -Yeah?
-Did he like the present? -Yeah.
Did they have the snake guy or the magician?
Snake guy.
-It bit Tucker. -It bit Tucker? Did it eat him?
Did you have trouble finding the place?
-No. -Well, thanks.
I know your secret.
I saw the tickets and note from your new boss.
You're not working at Random House in New York. I talked to them.
You're taking the kids and moving to Los Angeles.
What the hell are you doing, reading my mail?
Snooping around like some...
-...little dishonest-- -Dishonest?!
I wouldn't have to snoop around if you were honest with Luke.
I'd have thought this answered your prayers.
You lose the witch and her two little brats in one swoop.
Simplifies everything. You get your life back.
There's lots of publishing houses. Surely you can get a job in New York.
I'm supposed to rearrange my life to accommodate your schedules?
If you're concerned, why don't you get a new career?
Why don't you and Luke move to Los Angeles?
You can rearrange everyone's life without consulting us.
Bi-coastal parenting. People do it all the time.
Luke gets the kids one month during the summer...
...and every other holiday. It's not ideal but it works.
No, you can't do that.
You can't take the kids away from him.
-We can't live like that! -We?!
Luke has a problem, tell him to talk to me.
This is not about you. This is not your problem.
-It is my problem. -Why's that?
Because I'm marrying him.
We're going to share our life together. I love him.
His kids are everything to him, and he would be devastated...
...not to be near them.
And if....
You guessed the wrong secret.
Charlie Drummond...
...is a colleague of mine from Random House in New York.
She moved to the West Coast office. I'll crash with her...
...while I get protein injections...
...that are recommended by my oncologist.
You can only get them in Los Angeles.
Oncologist?
Life's a tradeoff.
It's finally legal to smoke dope, but you got to have cancer.
Are you dying?
Not today.
-We'll beat it. -It's a walk in the park.
Thanks for the "we."
You're not alone in this, you know.
You don't have to go through this alone.
You know that.
You understand what I'm saying?
What will we tell the kids?
We should tell them the truth.
They can handle it.
It should've been me instead of you.
I'll go along with that.
Look out.
You didn't see.
Gotcha!
Did he beat you? Here, 35 marshmallows.
35. Your sister put them in.
What's going on? Who's marrying who this time?
Mommy's marrying Isabel.
So cute.
No.
-Guys, Mommy's sick. -You still have the flu?
I have cancer. Do you know what that is?
It's what Aunt Mary died from.
Aunt Mary had a different kind.
There's different kinds. Hers was very...
...very bad.
Is yours bad?
I've been working with a doctor...
...and she says we have every reason to hope...
...that I'm going to be fine.
Check this out. Look at this.
-So cool. -No. It's okay.
Look at this.
I don't have to go to the hospital for medicine.
It looks like Game Boy.
It kind of is.
It'll make me strong, so I can fight the disease.
Cool.
Can I catch cancer?
No, sweetie. It's not contagious.
So you've known about this for a long time.
Yeah.
-And you never told me. -Sweetheart...
...your mom wanted to wait until the right time.
Guys, I'm sorry. Look, I just....
I know how scared I get when you're sick.
I thought it would be best to wait until it got smaller.
So you lied. You lied when you never told me.
Maybe you're lying now. I can never believe you again!
I made a mistake. People make mistakes.
Where's Isabel?
-What? -It's Thursday.
She should've picked us up.
I'd rather be with Mommy.
Well, she's dying. Isabel's your mother now.
Don't say that.
Anna!
Don't run out on your mother.
No, that's your job.
-I'm sorry you're sick. -What?
I said I'm sorry you're sick.
I can't hear you.
Turn down the music!
What?
I said...
...I'm sorry you're sick.
That's what I thought you said.
So what are you guys doing?
Marvin and I are getting our act together, right?
Right, Tammi.
That's one of Isabel's songs.
Isabel might know the words, babe, but I invented the moves.
-Right, Marvin? -Right, Tammi.
In fact...
...we're looking for somebody to do backup with us.
-Right, Marvin? -Yeah, Tammi!
Oh, my God!
Cool!
Sing it!
This land is your land
This land is my land
From California
To the New York islands
From the redwood forests
To the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me
As I was walking That ribbon of highway
I saw above me
That endless skyway
I saw below me
That golden valley
This land was made For you and me
This land is your land
This land is my land
From California To the New York island
From the redwood forests
You look great!
Your dad's meeting's running late so I came to watch.
I have to tell you something.
You're having Michael Jackson's baby.
That, and Anna is over her head...
...for Brad "The Flame" Kovitsky.
No way! I can't believe she would....
After how he was with all the girls in class!
I didn't know anything about this.
She was afraid you'd make a big deal. They've been going out for two weeks.
Which, in the 6th grade, doesn't mean anything.
They don't "go" anywhere. It's just their declaration--
I know. I had kids of my own once.
Anyway, today, in the lunch yard...
...he announces publicly that he's breaking up with her.
In front of everybody? That little shit!
Not you. Just go.
That's the point of going out.
So one of them can dump the other...
...and they can act out this passionate adult...
-...soap opera tragedy. -She must be devastated.
She cried in the girls' room. You think you've got problems.
This is serious.
This land is your land
This land is my land
From California
So, my point.
I pick her up from school.
She tells me the whole story and asks me what to do.
-What did you say? -"Beats me. Ask your mom."
So she's going to. Tomorrow.
-Be ready. -I'm ready. I'm ready.
What is this?
Thanksgiving dinner. These are the Clintons. We're having dinner.
That is my son...
...the turkey.
To the gulfstream waters
This land was made for you and me
This land was made
For you and me
Did they...?
Yeah. They killed him. But he does it so great.
But did you really think, at 12...
...you'd meet someone you'd want to spend your life with?
No.
Every time I'm on the lunch yard...
...and he's with 10 of his butt-kissing little weasels--
You don't like his friends.
They yell, "There goes the Virgin Queen" or "The Ice Princess"...
...or some clever cut like that. Like it hurts me.
You didn't let him kiss you.
Not with my mouth open.
That's my girl. Good for you.
Does that mean you let him kiss you with your mouth shut?
-Mom. -Sorry. Okay. Right.
What do you say to him when he says something like that?
I call him a fart-face or a pervert or something equally lame.
Sweetheart, you have to just ignore him.
He doesn't exist. You don't see him, you don't hear him.
He's just nothing. He's not there.
You are too much of a woman...
...to even...
...bother with such a little...
...boy as him.
You're kidding.
No. I mean, all he wants is the attention.
Once he doesn't get it, he might try harder...
...but then he'll get frustrated and give up.
So I ignore him. Keep my mouth shut.
Yep.
You think Isabel would do that?
It's just, she's younger. Maybe she remembers how to do this.
So this will work?
Hi, sweetie.
-What's wrong? -Nothing.
Is it time for you to go to L.A.?
No, it's still nighttime. And it's snowing.
I got a babysitter for Ben.
Do you want to go someplace special with me?
-Right now? -Yes.
Okay. Just you and me.
I'm never going to forget this.
Never say never.
Well, there's a loophole. You can say "never, never"...
...if you mean it enough to say it twice.
I'll remember always, always.
Promise, promise?
Move that carriage to the end of the street and start again.
Everybody keep moving.
-Go back to the starting point. -It's 1:45.
Want a lens?
Thanks, everybody! That's a wrap!
Thank you for a great day, folks.
It's 1:45. I told you, I have to pick up Anna and Benjamin.
You have to finish.
I've got it in the can. Coop can wrap the equipment.
This is my star account.
These clients need choices. They need variety.
I shot it 20 different angles. They'll have variety. Trust me.
I don't.
What are you saying?
I'm saying that you're the best I've got.
Probably the best I've ever worked with.
But these last couple of months, your work is slipping.
It's still fine, but you've lost your edge.
Your focus. Your dedication.
And your attitude...
...is very disappointing.
You're making a career decision here.
If you walk now, I'll have to let you go.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Isabel.
Damn.
It's okay. Don't worry. It's going to be fine.
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.
-Hey, Benjamin. -Yeah?
Why don't you go sit in the car, buddy?
-Don't drive away. -I won't.
What happened?
You know that boy I was telling you about, Brad Kovitsky?
He's been a real jerk lately, and my mom told me to ignore him.
So today...
...I did.
You know what he called me?
He called me "Frosty the Snow-bitch." In front of everyone.
-Men can be scum. -Yes, they can.
Is that little bastard here? I'll kick his ass.
No, his mother's always on time.
I have an idea.
No, thanks. I don't need advice from a stepmother.
Okay, yeah.
I can see how sitting out here in the cold and snow, crying...
...seems like a far superior idea to listening to...
...a stepmother.
But for kicks, let's lose the title.
Seems to me you have a choice: You can pretend to be an adult...
...or you can actually be one.
So...
...sit here in the cold, crying...
...by yourself...
...or...
...do something about it...
...together.
Crying.
Do something.
What's it going to be?
Do something.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Can we start by covering up my stepmother wart?
Because it must be showing.
Punk. It's cold. Let's go.
Benjamin will drive us home.
Okay, come on! Come on! Come on!
Okay. Next week, after school...
...you walk up to him...
...with attitude.
You hear me?
And you say: "Listen up, limp-dick...
...because I'll only say this once: As far as your...
...pitiful...
...knowledge of what a woman really wants goes...
...I am not going to waste my time with some loser...
...who doesn't even know what snowblowing is."
What is it?
It's a disgusting and not even remotely sexy thing...
...I heard described in a movie I'd never take you to.
But it is real. Now...
...the clincher:
You walk away...
...then you...
...whip around...
...and say:
"The guy I see is in high school...
...and it has to be said...
...he laughs his ass off whenever we talk about you."
I don't know anyone in high school.
There will be a suitable boy...
...outside your school on Monday at 2:30 with...
...a very expensive bike.
And he will be a stone fox, even if I have to call an escort service.
I've had the worst day.
Until now.
Me too.
United Airlines announces the arrival of Flight 86...
...service from Los Angeles.
Deplaning passengers may be met at gate number 12.
I'll get your bags.
-The taxis are just over there. -Thanks.
Surprise!
Why is she in a wheelchair?
She's traveled a long way. She's tired. Give her a hug. Be gentle.
Look at this guy. Hi.
Let's go home.
-Welcome back. -Thanks. What a great surprise.
Hey, let me out!
Your brother's got to get out.
Sorry.
I'm in the family too, you know.
-What's up? -We have a surprise for you.
No way.
-What is it? -We can't tell you. It's a surprise.
Come on, tell me.
-Ben, tell me. -No way!
-Come on. Tell me. -No way.
Close your eyes.
Step.
You're almost there. Don't open your eyes.
Just a little peek?
Gosh!
Come in! Come in!
All right, ready? One, two, three...
...open!
Isn't it great?
Isabel did it.
-Isabel? -Yeah.
I'm working on a Christmas project for Ben and Anna...
...and there aren't any recent photos of me with the kids.
I was just wondering...
...if you'd take some.
Sure. Love to.
Thanks.
Hey, guys, wait up. Wait up for me!
Stop there for a second. Great!
Perfect. Benjamin, that's a dazzling display of horsemanship.
Come on, you lazy horse, get up!
"One day, five men came in funny hats...
...to pick the biggest, fastest, roughest bull to fight...
...in the bullfights in Madrid."
Hi, Mom!
Are you okay?
There we go.
Almost.
Well, almost not falling. That was the first time he fell.
Awesome fall.
Are you going to try it again?
One over here. Everybody.
Cheese!
Are you going back?
-Yeah. -More?
-Yeah. -All right!
Go for it. I'm watching.
Ben was born in two hours, went to the breast...
...and camped there for the next four days.
Always with this...
...mischievous look on his face. Like he had a secret or something.
And his...
...blanket...
...always looked like a cape. Even the nurses said so.
He loves hearing that story over and over.
About how he was born a magician.
-And her? -Twenty-eight hours.
The doctors wanted to go in and get her.
But I knew she'd come in her own time. That's just the way she is.
Can't let anybody rush her.
I'll keep that in mind.
It didn't work, did it?
I'm sorry.
Hey. You did everything you could.
There are still options.
There's a treatment in Paris, one in Switzerland, both recommended--
Thanks, but...
...I think I want to spend...
...my time at home...
...with my family.
Yeah.
Christmas will be here before you know it.
-I thought you might need one of these. -I do. It looks great.
A little more.
A little more.
Okay.
I think that's fine. Stop.
Perfect.
Smells great too.
Thanks.
What are we supposed to do without you?
You'll be fine.
You're a great father.
I just never really....
I didn't give you the chance to realize it.
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.
As for your pitiful knowledge of what a woman really wants...
...I'm not wasting my time on some loser...
...who doesn't even know what snowblowing is.
-Loser. -Good one.
And the guy I see...
...is in high school, and it has to be said...
...that every time we talk about you, he laughs his ass off.
Yeah, right.
You don't believe me? He's standing right over there.
No way.
Well, believe it.
You rule, Anna! You rule!
-You blew it! -Loser!
Hi.
-What are you doing here? -Picking up my kids from school.
Who is that?
He looks like that guy in his underwear for Calvin Klein.
-Fully dressed for Ralph Lauren. -What?
What? No.
He's such a loser!
Moron!
It worked, it worked, it worked!
Did you see the look on Brad's face? Thank you so much!
Okay. "Limp-dick" I know.
What exactly is "snowblowing"?
It doesn't matter. I didn't explain it.
But I'll have to explain it to the 20 or 30 parents who call...
...in the next half-hour.
Give them my number.
I think they'll want to talk to Anna's mother.
What are you worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
You defend what you did?
-Right to the ground. -You put filth in my child's mouth.
You had her lie about that model.
And it worked like a charm.
And you became a hero, and I became I schmuck.
Basically, you taught my child...
...that I am a loser...
...who doesn't care about her pain.
-That's not what I tried to do. -That's what you did.
Did you think I didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?
-I couldn't figure out some low blows? -You weren't passing them out.
I believe, in a crisis, you have an opportunity to learn something.
That's deep.
It was a lie.
Winning without dignity or grace is not winning.
She has to figure out who she is, so she can stand up to peer pressure...
...and steer her own course.
She wasn't steering her own course.
She was steering yours.
That's what parenting is all about, little girl.
They are pleading for you to tell them how to do the right thing.
Sure as hell, that's what you've done.
The next time something happens, and the stakes are high...
...she'll look back and remember how easy it was and how good it felt.
And she'll stand up for herself. Dear God, what have I done?
You have turned her into you.
That's what this is about.
That's all it's about.
How would you know what this is about?
You haven't been here from the beginning...
...worrying every day that the decisions you're making...
...will shape the people they're going to be.
And you are not what I want my children to be.
I don't want that, either.
This isn't about me or you. It's about them.
And believe it or not, I am trying.
And I do have their very...
...best interests at heart.
-Would you like a drink? -Patrón, please. Double.
What's up?
Last year, I lost Ben.
-What? -In the supermarket.
You're lying.
It's true.
That's impossible. You could never lose that kid for one second.
I did.
Ben never mentioned it.
He just remembers I found him.
Why didn't you tell me?
You know why.
I never wanted to be a mom.
Well, sharing it with you is one thing.
Carrying it alone the rest of my life...
...always being compared to you....
You're perfect.
They worship you.
I just don't want to be looking over my shoulder for 20 years...
...knowing...
...that someone else would've done it right.
Done it better.
The way that I can't.
What do I have that you don't?
You're Mother Earth incarnate.
You're...
...hip and fresh.
-You ride with Anna. -You'll learn.
You know every story.
Every wound.
Every memory.
Their whole life's happiness is wrapped up in you.
Every single moment.
Don't you get it?
Look down the road to her wedding.
I'm in a room...
...alone with her.
Fitting her veil.
Fluffing her dress.
Telling her...
...no woman has ever looked that beautiful.
And my fear is...
...that she'll be thinking:
"I wish my mom was here."
And mine is...
...she won't.
But the truth is...
...she doesn't have to choose.
She can have us both.
Love us both.
And she will be a better person because of me...
...and because of you.
I have their past...
...and you can have their future.
Guys, it's Christmas!
Wake up!
I hope there's a white dove.
I hope there's a white dove.
There has to be a white dove.
Hark, I hear the gentle sounds of Benjamin.
We better get out there before he opens all the presents.
Ben, Ben, Ben.
Have a little patience.
Can I open my presents now?
Your mom wants you to go upstairs and open presents with her first.
Then we'll open presents down here, okay?
Okay. Me first.
Merry Christmas.
Sweetie, I think this has your name on it.
A real magician's cape.
Awesome!
Come here, I'll help you with it.
What does it have all over it? Could you see?
Pictures of me and you.
And this one right here? See that one?
That's our first official photo of you and me as a couple.
See that?
Did you know I was good-looking right away?
Everybody in the hospital talked about it. Are you kidding?
But this good-looking was beyond my imagination.
Are you dying?
What do you think?
Yes.
Then I won't see you anymore.
Well, you won't see my body, but....
You know how a caterpillar becomes something else?
-A butterfly. -Yeah.
You just have to think of me...
...as off flying somewhere.
And, of course, the magician...
...knows the secret...
...that just because you don't see something...
...doesn't mean it's not there.
So even though it might seem like I'm gone...
...the magician knows better.
So where will you be?
Right here.
Right here, inside the magician.
Can I talk to you when you're there?
Always. Always, always.
You won't hear my voice...
...but deep inside...
...you'll know what I'm saying.
-It's not good enough. -No.
No.
Of course it isn't, because it isn't everything.
And we want everything, don't we?
Yeah.
But we still have one thing.
One of our greatest things we'll always have.
You know what that is?
Our dreams.
We can still meet in our dreams.
We can talk to each other there...
...and go for walks together in the summer...
...and in the winter, and in the rain...
...and in the sun...
...and I can come and pick you up and we can go flying.
Nobody's loved you like I do.
Nobody ever will.
Hi.
-I brought you some tea. -Merry Christmas, baby.
Merry Christmas.
Look what Mom made me.
I'll go show Dad and Isabel.
-Here. -Thank you, sweetheart.
Oh, Mom.
Will you make sure Dad knows how to double-knot...
...my sneakers for school in the morning?
Yes.
Thanks.
That's yours.
It's a quilt.
-And it has our pictures on it. -Put it here.
It's like a scrapbook you can keep warm with.
It's so beautiful. I've never seen anything like it.
See the horse? And your medals that you got?
Remember this dress you wouldn't take off in Pre-K for 3 weeks?
Remember that?
Your first step. Look at your foot.
Look at that little chubby-cheeked thing. Look at you.
Are you scared?
A little.
Mostly, I was scared...
...for you...
...but I'm not anymore because I know you'll be okay.
I don't want to say goodbye. I'm going to miss you so much.
Oh, sweetie.
It's okay. Oh, sweetie.
My sweetie. It's okay.
It's okay to miss me. It's okay.
You can miss me...
...and you can take me with you.
You can. And when you're in trouble...
...I'll be there.
When you fall in love, I'll be there.
You can.
I mean, that's how...
...people go on forever.
Because somebody takes them along.
On your graduation...
...and your wedding...
...and when you have your babies.
Take me along, will you?
Always, always and always.
You have made my life...
...so wonderful.
Take that with you too, okay?
Wow, Mom! It's so cool!
See what you got there, Ben.
I don't know.
What's the matter? You look disappointed.
No, everything is great, Mom.
-I love my presents. -Hey, guys!
Looks like we forgot one.
It's got your name on it, buddy.
Abracadabra!
-What a beautiful cage. -Yeah.
It's empty.
Let's try it again.
I think maybe this time...
...you should say the magic words.
Abracadabra! Allakazam!
Allakazoom. Boom!
It worked!
Why doesn't everybody get on the sofa for a picture?
Baby, can you put that birdcage on the floor?
And I'll set up here.
All right. There you go.
On the count of three, I want to see big Christmas smiles.
One, two...
...Benjamin, three.
Excellent.
Good one. Now let's get one with the whole family. Isabel?
Okay. Let me just...
Come on, Ben!
Vincent!
Hurry up!
Vincent, what are you doing?
Vincent!
Okay, Ben. You won!
Vincent?
Admit it. You're looking forward to this.
I got the weekend crowd. They're not even going to notice.
Give me a break, Ben.
You're the one that wants to go.
Vincent!
Vincent!
Ben! You little jerk!
Did you get in and the lid shut on you?
-We go now? -Yeah, right. We go now.
You'll probably play pool with Joey after you close the restaurant.
If you're dumb enough to take three kids to your class reunion...
...I'm smart enough to have a good time.
-Hey, party! -Party hearty!
Ben!
-I'm underwater! -That's great news.
Where's your brother?
I don't know.
Will you go find Vincent, please?
Did you remember the sandwiches?
Of course not.
Bethie, if your head wasn't screwed on--
You'd find it sitting by the microwave.
Then I'd have to call you in Chicago.
Who needs a head at a high-school reunion?
I want to stay with Dad and go to the restaurant.
I'm not going to Chicago!
You're going!
I hate Ben, I hate Kerry...
...and I hate....
Let me finish out the roll.
-Pat, now? -Just two shots!
By the lilacs. It'll take just a second.
All right, look at Daddy.
I know, the photographer hates having her picture taken.
Everybody say...
...meatball!
Benbo, bologna is for eating...
...not washing windows.
Your seat belt's loose.
Mom, sing me...
...that bunny song.
I wish I was still home with Dad.
Sing me, If a bunny catch a bunny
If a bunny catch a bunny
-Coming through the rye -I hate this song!
If a bunny...
...kiss a bunny
And made a bunny cry
You're here.
I'm here!
Just a second, let me get Kerry.
No, no. Let me get her.
Look at her!
Watch your head, Benbo.
I'm your godmama, Kerry.
Remember me?
God love her! Look at her.
My God!
Is that Ben?
Ben! You're a grown-up.
Vincent, can you swim?
Martha's inside, waiting for you.
Come on, sweetie.
I have a surprise!
Where's your tooth?
I lost it.
Speak of the devil!
Beth, you remember Martha, the babysitter from God.
Great! Can you help with Kerry?
Sure thing, Mrs. Cappadora.
Mrs. Cappadora.
Good Christ!
Is there some kind of registration table?
You're set. I stuck it on my card.
Ellen, you can't do that!
It's 70 bucks. Who cares?
Donna Trump, I care.
Besides, I can write it off.
I've got a fashion shoot on Sunday.
Boutique on Oak Street.
You'll have to go up in that mess and rearrange it, then.
Oh, Jesus!
Is that Michelle Pulliam?
Did she ever marry that guy?
They broke up. Then she went out with--
-Elizabeth Kerry and her merry band! -Jimmy!
How're my big guys?
Wow! Vincent!
You have gotten so huge!
They'd hug any man with a badge, and so would I.
What would you do if you found out I made detective?
Congratulations!
Guess who I just saw?
Cecil Lockhart.
You mean Cecilia Lockhart?
Star of stage, screen and mouthwash commercials.
My God! There she is.
Remember when she first got laid?
When she was 15, and she told us:
"I can't imagine going a month without it."
She was talking about pizza, guys.
Hey, Beth!
My God! How are you?
-Look at you! How are you? -Good, good.
Is this your new one?
Where's little Vincent?
I'm not little.
No, you're not.
-Sandy! Bye-- -Mom, I want to go.
I want pizza!
You stay with your brother.
Martha, would you take care of the car?
-I'll handle it. -I'll pay the thing.
Vincent?
Listen. I want you to hold Ben's hand real tight.
And you guys can play on this really cool cart, okay?
Mom, my neck's hot.
My neck's killing me.
Vincent, listen.
This'll only take a second.
Stay here with Ben while I pay the lady.
When Martha comes, she'll take you swimming, okay?
Thanks.
-Sorry it took so long. -That's okay.
Where's Ben?
He wouldn't let me hold him. Would you look at my neck?
I've got a heat rash or something.
Hold on, sweetie.
Ben?
Ellen?
Ben took off. Would you...?
I'll find him. See you later.
You stay here. Don't move.
Ben?
Have you seen a little boy?
He's got a red baseball cap, 3 years old.
No, sorry.
Thanks.
Ben?
Excuse me.
Vincent...
...think hard.
Which way did Ben go?
I don't know.
Didn't you watch?
I couldn't see him.
He wasn't over there.
We should get the manager.
I don't know.
Maybe if we just wait....
Stop!
Everybody please just listen up for a second.
We need to look for Beth Kerry's little boy.
His name is Ben.
He's 3, he was wearing a red baseball cap.
He was just here a second ago.
So if you'd look around where you are.
Wait. Hold on, folks.
We'll find him. It's going to be fine.
I'm going to divide the room down the middle.
I want you to stay in your half and look around you.
If you see Ben...
...pick him up and call out to me, all right?
Pat will be here soon, right?
I didn't call him.
I thought we'd find Ben right away.
Let's make that call now, right?
Here you go.
Go ahead, Beth.
-Hello? -Patty!
Magill, talk to the female.
Coleman, come with me.
Mrs. Cappadora?
I'm Officer Magill.
You brought a lot of officers.
We take the disappearance of a child very seriously.
You're worried, then?
We'll find him.
Lost kids, we always find them.
And they're okay.
-They're not hurt. -Good.
If it gets to five hours, we usually consider it....
Anyway, we'll find him before then.
So your friend Elaine was with you?
Ellen.
She met me out front. She was waiting for me.
Besides Ellen, who was the first person you talked to?
The cheerleaders.
Would another family member...
...on your side have any reason to pick up the boy?
My folks are dead.
There's nobody.
Has he ever been fingerprinted?
No.
Yes!
The school district had a program.
It's been four hours.
We've got everybody on it, okay?
This is my boss, Detective Supervisor Bliss.
-Bliss? -Candy Bliss.
It sounds like a stripper's name.
The things parents do to kids!
I can't believe I said that.
We'll do everything we can to find your boy.
Description out?
They're checking the database now.
Great.
First, I want to tell you this is nobody's fault.
Kids disappear all the time, and somebody always finds them.
That's right.
We're set up over here.
Where is he?
My son! Where is he?
We haven't found him yet--
Where's Ben?
Where's Bethie?
Bethie?
Pat!
How did this happen?
Okay, all right, okay.
It'll be okay.
Where is it nobody's searched?
The basement?
It's just food storage. All the doors are kept locked.
But you have freezers, cabinets?
Ben loves hiding places. Take me down there.
You okay?
You sure?
I'm going downstairs a minute. You stay here with Mommy, okay?
Let's go.
Mom!
Patty!
Are you all right?
My God in heaven! How long has he been missing?
About five hours.
They'll remember. They'll make one more call.
I'll take you to the command center.
Kerry and Vincent will come...
...to the house. It's better, right?
-Where's Kerry? -Upstairs.
You'll come with Grandma, honey.
You go with Grandma, Vincent, okay?
Will you tell me when Ben gets back, Mom?
She'll tell us.
Sit down, sweetheart.
I'm sorry.
Do you have any other pictures of Ben?
I lost my purse.
No, no, no. I have it, honey.
Ben!
Bethie, honey, it's okay.
Set her down!
I want Ben!
Grab her wrist and hold her down. Medic!
It's okay. It's all right.
Give her something!
Quick!
It's all right, sweetheart. It's all right.
I know, Bethie. I know.
You don't know.
I don't even know.
How long are you staying with your parents?
Do the police have leads?
Have the kidnappers tried to contact you?
How long were you gone before you noticed your son was missing?
-Who'd want to do this? -How long will you be in Chicago?
He's 3 years old...
...but he's big for his age.
And people always think he's older.
He's very verbal.
He babbles to himself.
Sometimes you can barely hear him...
...but he says his words very clearly.
He has blond hair and blue eyes.
And he was wearing...
...a red baseball cap.
And he loves pizza.
He's very afraid of the water.
He loves...
...to sing songs.
Sometimes he'll sing the same song over and over again.
He was wearing...
...red shoes.
High-top sneakers with green parrots on the side.
And white socks.
And a red T-shirt...
...with yellow sleeves...
...and little blue shorts. Blue plaid shorts.
Call you when we get home.
Unbelievable, right?
Diane Lundgren's on her way over...
...and Cecil Lockhart signed up.
But her mother got sick.
You know who else called?
Lizzy De Nunzio.
-Where is she now, Switzerland? -I think she moved there.
-How'd she even find out about it? -Who knows?
But she just sounds sick about it.
-Everyone is, Bethie. -I know.
I know.
Laurie!
I can't believe you're here.
What was I supposed to do? Stay in Madison? Watch CNN?
Hey, Tommy.
Have you seen Candy?
-She's with McGuire. -Thanks, Ricky.
Then go to Minneapolis. How far can it be?
We've been getting bogus leads...
...every day for six weeks now. This kid is dead and you know it.
Don't tell me I know it! I don't know it.
This is interstate. I have to call the FBI.
Come on, Candy, the FBI?
Give me a break.
Hey, Bethie.
So you heard that?
I heard something about the FBI.
Come into my office.
Have a seat.
Listen, Beth.
Just because volunteers are going home...
...doesn't mean the case is closed.
Some of them got lives.
I don't.
So I'm here.
And I'm not giving up.
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I'm a jerk.
There's nothing wrong with what you just did.
I'm just an oversensitive jerk.
You're too involved. You can't--
I'm black.
I'm a woman. I'm a detective supervisor.
And I'm gay. Did you know that?
I always feel like the eyes of Texas are on me.
Every time I hug Katie from Crime Stoppers...
...I think she thinks I'm coming on to her.
-I wasn't-- -No, I know that.
I just wanted you to know I'm a little jerkish today.
So that calls for a Gummi Bear.
Tough guys chew Gummi Bears.
Beth, you laughed.
You only laughed.
It doesn't mean our side loses points.
It doesn't mean you'll kill your son because you laughed.
You have got to survive.
That's just it.
I don't want to survive Ben.
I don't want to face it.
Then I guess you can just...
...move into a corner in my office, and I'll use you as a coat rack.
You got to do whatever you got to do.
But you got two great kids, which I would give my right arm for.
Though you think you're a terrible mother...
...you're the only mother they have.
I should go home.
Jill's been great with Kerry.
Really great.
But I think Vincent's going to need a little time.
He'll be fine. He's been back, what, six weeks?
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Coming?
Jill, we're back!
Baby, you scared me.
How's my big guy?
Are you good?
Mom, guess what?
On Thursday, I made six baskets in a row!
Look how long your legs are.
How is she? Has she been in bed all day?
Pretty much.
How'd Vincent get home? Did you pick him up?
Yeah, I didn't have class today.
Okay, thanks.
Did she say she was coming down?
No, she didn't.
So some girl walks in, chewing gum...
...and talking through her nose...
...has legs up to her neck.
Paolo just says, "Great, you're hired!"
The new kids we got...
...don't know spaghetti from scampi.
They think the cash register is their personal savings account.
I'll tell you what...
...when I open my own place...
...this is exactly what you won't see.
Guess what happened.
I thought today was Sunday.
Isn't that funny?
Can we just please go?
I'm going to work, honey.
Beth, you downstairs?
Honey, what are you doing?
Ever been in a doctor's office without a People magazine?
One day, Ben will go to a doctor's office with whoever took him.
-And some other patient-- -Laurie, stop! Okay?
I know you mean well, but just...
...stop.
-That's real leather? -You bet!
-Thanks, Uncle Joey. -You're welcome.
Check this out, buddy.
Could be more presents.
Merry Christmas!
Joey, it's cold. Shut the door.
-Where's the tree? -Pat went to get it.
Where's my presents?
Merry Christmas, Beth!
Mom, look, Uncle Joey gave me my stocking present early...
...because it's too big to fit in the stocking.
-See? -Yeah, that's great!
Merry Christmas, Beth.
-Merry Christmas, Theresa. -How you feeling, honey?
I almost didn't make it. I started having Braxton-Hicks.
-You should breathe in a bag. -I'll try that.
-May be a Christmas baby. -I hope not.
She's carrying like it's a boy. That's what everybody says.
The gang's all here!
-My God, sis, look how big you are! -Don't rub it in.
Patty, it's beautiful!
-Who do you think these are for? -Me?
One is from me, and one's from Grandpa Angelo.
-Help me wrap. -Look at the cards.
Did you buy out the whole store?
Who's counting? It's Christmas.
Now, these are very special.
Look, Mom, they're for Ben from Grandma and Grandpa.
Rosie, what are these?
Presents for Ben.
Why did you bring presents for Ben?
I believe that Ben will be found.
When he is found, I want him to know his family didn't forget him.
Do you have the impression we've forgotten Ben?
Of course not.
-We didn't get Ben any gifts. -I understand that.
I didn't even want to go through...
...this whole, big holiday act.
You know what I wanted to do? I wanted to sleep through it.
When you do this, like he's just...
...out of town on some business trip and he'll be back anytime--
-Beth, take it easy. -Take it easy!
How can I take it easy when nobody except me...
...seems to want to accept the fact that it's over?
It's over!
We're all going to go on eating and sleeping--
You have to snap out of this. No one can talk to you.
I can't.
-Pat can't. -Butt out!
If you don't have hope Ben will come back--
Come back? He's not even 4 yet.
What's he going to do? Get an Amtrak schedule?
We didn't mean anything by it.
-Don't you think we're all grieving? -I mean it!
-Shut up! -No, Pat!
You're all scared to say this, but I'm not.
We try and call. She doesn't want to talk.
We write. She doesn't answer.
Mom, Ben will be back tomorrow.
What?
Because it's Christmas. For my present...
...I asked Santa to bring Ben home.
I think he'll do it.
-Where is she? -She's upstairs.
She still won't speak to me, will she?
I think she will.
Everybody's been calling.
After your talk with People, we reprinted the poster five times.
I think she hates my guts.
What are you doing?
Ending world hunger.
I just got off the phone with the U.N.
That's good.
Look, will you just forgive me...
...and get this over with?
I'd never give them anything unless it was the right thing to do.
I would never do a thing to hurt you.
How long have we been friends?
One thousand years.
-I know. -Then good, okay?
I have something I want you to do.
I don't believe you.
-I want you to take a picture. -I don't do that anymore.
I took early retirement.
You could use the money.
This is good money.
Good for what?
I want her to take a portrait of a Chinese family.
We are kind of tapped out, just keeping Vincent in sneakers.
You could do this.
You wouldn't even have to go out.
I threw away all my paper and stuff.
I'll go get you more paper and stuff.
Please.
Please, just this once.
Let me get rid of my guilt by doing you this one good turn.
This is not a good turn. This is a setup.
These are really beautiful.
I have to print. I have four phone calls to make.
I have to get Vincent ready for Little League.
Thought any more about Chicago?
What about it?
Could be great.
Kids'll love it there.
-I'll have my own restaurant. -I have to get Kerry up.
-There's plenty of time for that. -Okay, fine.
You go upstairs, get my diaphragm, fill it up with gunk and...
...we'll have eight minutes before I have to feed Vincent.
We can have a lot of fun in eight minutes.
Fine. You want to do it right here?
I can make toast at the same time.
It's not like I'm on top of you all the time.
We make love as often as we pay the water bill.
I don't see why you need a diaphragm every time.
I don't want to get pregnant every time.
We had three kids and we always wanted more. I miss that.
I miss this house being full of noise.
I used to want to run up the walk to lunch.
It's not going to change anything.
Another kid. It'd be like a replacement part.
Like you get a new gravy boat so you don't spoil the set.
That's a lousy fucking thing to say.
I agree. So I'll stop saying fucking lousy things.
I'm not having a baby, and I'm not moving to Chicago...
...so you can start a restaurant with your dad.
You want a new baby and restaurant? You need a new wife.
All I want is for us to be a family again.
Nothing's wrong with that.
That's healthy!
You want to know what it's like?
It's like I'm standing under this giant...
...snowbank.
If I move one inch in any direction...
...it's going to come crashing down...
...and bury me.
Do you know...
...I don't dare think of him for a full minute?
One inch...
...and the whole thing's going to come down.
You will have to raise these kids by yourself.
I'm doing that now.
That's right.
Pat's always been the rock.
Isn't that what it said in People?
There was Pat holding together that poor, crazy woman...
...and those sweet little kids. You're such a hero.
All right, stop this.
You would never have let Ben get lost.
I mean it. Stop it.
You wouldn't have been such a shitty parent...
...who can't remember the sandwiches...
...who can't get Kerry's bottle together!
That's right, I wouldn't!
If you'd just pay attention to somebody besides yourself!
None of this would have happened, right?
Scream!
Come on, Kerry. Scream!
I was there to pick up after you!
You self-righteous son of a bitch!
I'm not self-righteous! I'm right!
Kids don't just vanish up in smoke.
Kids don't just get lost.
People lose them!
Vincent, what happened?
What happened, honey?
Why was she screaming?
Is she all right?
Yeah, she's fine.
Where are we going?
Just thought I'd take a drive.
She just misses him, Daddy.
That's right, Vincent.
That's right.
This is the bar and the waiting area.
That's the wine rack. Dad's personal design.
People sit here while they wait for tables.
That's the kitchen back there...
...and this is it.
The murals are done.
Tables will be through here...
...and they'll carry back over to there.
This is the dance floor.
There'll be a live band over here...
...Thursday through Sunday.
Theresa, is that a town in Italy?
You like it, honey?
It's La Bohème.
You're Mimi and I'm Rodolfo.
-Except she lives in the end. -Well, good.
-It's gorgeous. It really is. -Can you believe this place?
I don't.
I can't wait.
That's a good one. We got to get in that.
Alex, come on, listen.
So what's Mr. Tough Guy up to?
Apart from needing a haircut.
I don't know.
He's making friends, I guess.
He's been on the phone a lot lately.
If you're using that phone for your bookie operation...
-...it'll be a part of your anatomy. -I'm not, Dad. Jesus!
I got to go.
Well, this is really nice.
It is, isn't it?
New house, new restaurant.
You're doing a really good imitation of having a life.
You have the biggest snarl right here.
No, wait, Kerry. Just one more.
Are you in sixth?
Yeah. You're in third.
You were the soybean, right?
Actually, I was the feed corn.
Who do you have?
-Cook. -Yeah, I had Cook.
She's pretty decent.
Mommy?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I was leaving my number in case you needed your lawn mowed.
But I'll come back later.
I really do need my lawn mowed.
Could you do it today?
Yeah. Sure.
I'll get my stuff. I live two blocks down there.
You don't need a mower! We have a mower.
My brother's supposed to do it.
He's in high school. He's lazy!
Do you know that boy?
It's not talking to strangers if you're in your own house.
I know.
That's true. Do you know his name?
It's Jason. He's on patrol.
No, wait, I'm wrong.
Jason wears the beanie hat. He got reported.
You don't know his name?
It's Sam Kero.
Kero something.
Mom, where are you going?
Are you going to work?
You know what?
I have to take some leaf pictures.
It's okay if you go across the street and play with Blythe.
I'm taking pictures of leaves.
That's my job. I take pictures.
Shit!
Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father who takes away sin.
Have mercy on us. Have mercy on us.
I want you to go downstairs and order a pizza.
Do that, then go to Blythe's...
...get Kerry and put on a video for her.
Get the money from my purse.
I have to work in the darkroom.
It's very important and it can't wait.
I want you to give Kerry pizza. Will you do that?
Don't I always? Jesus!
It is, isn't it?
Is this possible?
Here's the aging projection they did around the time he was 8.
Who is he?
He came to the door to mow lawns. I let him mow the lawn.
He's coming back tomorrow. He ran out of gas.
Where does he live?
Two blocks.
Two blocks from here?
Did he just move here?
I don't know how long....
Kerry knows him from school, and she's been at Sandburg...
...for what, two years? Good Christ!
He's probably just some kid who looks like Ben.
-His hair is darker. -No, you're right.
Let's call Candy. Then we're going to that house.
It's late at night. He's sleeping.
We don't even know his last name.
Two blocks from here. I mean....
-When he saw you, did he-- -Nothing.
He had no idea. But he was 3, and he doesn't know this house.
I'm going to call Pop.
Don't tell him. Not until we know.
No, I just....
I'm not going to work tomorrow.
What were you doing on the porch?
I was watching the sun come up.
-You got a ride? -Kenny's dad is picking me up.
Finish up.
-I'm riding my bike. -No, you're not.
I'm 9 now. I'm older than the other 18 kids in my class.
People who live in walking distance don't ride bikes.
Besides, you don't have a bike lock.
Could you get me one?
Yes, I'll get you a bike lock today. I promise.
You can ride your bike to school tomorrow.
Come on, let's go.
Bye, Mom.
Vincent, wait.
I love you.
-I want you to know I love you. -Thank you, Mom.
I know it sounds insane.
I don't know if it's him for sure.
I don't know what I know.
It can't be Ben...
...but it's Ben.
Isn't it?
I say we go in.
He's in protective custody.
We got an unmarked in front of the suspect's house.
We snatched the kid from school.
The principal probably called the father.
What are we waiting for?
There's a process involved here.
It's not like you're bringing him home today.
He'll have to go to foster care. He'll need counseling.
There'll be a period of transition.
Anyway, we want to make sure we I.D. the boy 100%.
Look at the picture!
It's the same kid. It's Sam Karras!
Don't go off half-cocked on me. This is a big case.
It wouldn't hurt to get a warrant.
I got the warrant.
I talked to the D.A.
Bliss.
Thank you.
The fingerprints match.
You folks ready for this?
You don't get to be ready for this.
They're busting you for hot-wiring Jamie's car.
I don't think so. I'm going to call you later, okay?
Shit!
Come in here, will you please?
This is Chief Bastokovich.
Kerry's got Girl Scouts, right?
I think....
She won't be home till after five?
Right.
You saw that picture this morning.
That's why the police are here.
I thought it was a fire drill. Can I just go upstairs?
Listen to me.
We think the boy in that picture is Ben.
The kid in that house on Maple, right?
You saw him?
You saw Ben?
I didn't know it was Ben. I'd see this kid goofing around.
I mean, he looked--
I never really thought about it much.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me or your father?
Tell you what?
I found my long-lost brother?
Would you have listened to me?
Would you have even heard me?
When did you first see him?
How long have we lived here?
It doesn't matter now.
I'll tell you when--
-I'll tell you. -Fine. Do that.
Hi, Pop.
They're about to move on him.
Ready.
You stay here.
We'll call you in 15 minutes.
I'm coming in.
I'm coming in.
You don't say anything. Just listen.
George Karras?
-What's wrong? -I'm Detective Candy Bliss.
Do you have a 12-year-old boy named Sam living in this house?
Yes, I do.
My God, my son. Is he hurt?
No, he's fine.
He's in the custody of Protective Services.
What are you talking about? He's at school.
You're under arrest for kidnapping...
...in connection with the abduction... ...June 3rd, 1988, of Benjamin Cappadora.
...June 3rd, 1988, of Benjamin Cappadora.
You have the right to remain silent.
What you say can and will be used against you....
You've got the wrong house.
The people that lost their boy live around the corner.
Over on Drummond.
No, no.
My neighbor knows the family. This is a big mistake.
Do you understand these rights as I've read them?
Of course I do.
Can we come in?
Sure.
We have a warrant to search the premises.
-Can you step over here? -This is a mistake.
-You don't have any guns? -No, I don't.
You won't mind if the officers search here?
I didn't do anything. This is my house. I was just doing the books.
I don't even know why you people are here.
That's Cecil.
That's Cecil Lockhart.
You know her from television?
Why do you have a picture of Cecil Lockhart?
She was my wife.
Cecil gave birth in 1985...
...which is the same year Ben was born.
Apparently, the baby had complications and died.
She had a nervous breakdown. They had to put her away.
She got out three years after that, just in time...
...to make it to the reunion, where she saw Ben and snatched him.
She disappeared into Minneapolis...
...where she met George and married him.
He adopted Ben...
...and then they moved here.
About five years ago, she committed suicide.
I got to tell you, I feel...
...totally responsible...
...for a lot of what's happened.
We interviewed this woman.
I sat in this woman's house. I had tea with her.
And somewhere in there was Ben...
...and I missed him.
George Karras wasn't at all suspicious, and he adopted Ben.
So she lied to her husband.
She lied to me.
I'm supposed to know when people are lying because I'm a supercop.
I didn't find him. You guys did.
No one found him.
He found us.
Are you heading to the foster home now?
What will you say to him?
How's it feel to get your son back?
Did you contact him at all in the last two weeks?
Will you call him Ben or Sam?
Do you have any statement to make?
How are you?
I'm good.
Dad?
-Yes? -Yeah, Sam?
Stop fidgeting.
You're not hungry?
I'm eating.
I'm not an industrial vacuum, like some people.
Could I have some milk?
You do milk with pizza?
I like milk with pizza.
-Good night, Kerry. -Good night, Mom.
Do you want the light on?
No, I don't sleep with a light.
Do you want an extra blanket or anything?
I'm okay.
The Bulls are home tomorrow. Do you want to go?
Good night.
I'll put an extra blanket there, just in case.
If he needs one, he'll ask for it.
He doesn't know how cold this house gets.
Please relax, honey. Okay?
-Relax. He's home. -Oh, God.
I just want to go in and look at him.
Here, just wear these.
I hate those.
You loved those socks three days ago.
It's not for church. I want tights.
Pick out whatever you want, but hurry. I have to get dressed.
Why doesn't he like us?
-Who? -Ben.
Sam.
He does.
It's just, he's....
Even though he's your brother...
...this is all very new for him.
He just needs time to--
He just needs time to get used to us.
And we have to help him, okay?
Hurry.
Today, we celebrate the presence among us...
Today, we celebrate the presence among us... ...in their wholeness...
...of the Cappadora family.
As you all know, their son Ben was taken from them...
...and, by what can only be called... ...a modern-day miracle, returned to them just weeks ago...
...a modern-day miracle, returned to them just weeks ago...
...not maimed, not torn...
...but healthy and whole.
I ask you to join with them today...
...in their gratitude and their faith.
I'm also asked to remind you...
...of the celebration at Cappadora's Restaurant...
...of the celebration at Cappadora's Restaurant... ...immediately following the mass.
Are you okay?
Yeah, Dad.
-I'm so happy for you! -Thank you, Susan.
Congratulations!
That's the big brother.
I want us all to walk in together.
Yes, Mom. The perfect family.
Welcome home.
Thank you.
The table's here.
Loosen up, man.
I'll show you something.
This is called the tarantella.
It's an Italian dance. You want to learn it?
You can learn it.
I don't know this dance. I only know the Hasapiko.
-You'll have to say it again. -Hasapiko.
Hey, guys, can you hold it?
My son doesn't know the tarantella...
...but he knows the Hasapiko. You know it?
-Of course. -Great!
I better go up there.
Put your arm out.
Come over here.
Ready?
Right, back...
...right, together.
Left, together.
Right, back, right, together.
Yes, Mr. Karras?
I came to bring you Sam's records.
Photos.
This is his...
...medical chart.
This is his dental.
One cavity in his permanent teeth when he was 10.
Report cards....
You'll see.
A little trouble in math.
You know, this....
This was my wife...
...and my son.
This wasn't some lunatic and the boy she kidnapped.
Not to me.
Good night.
What did he want?
We missed a lot of years.
Where you been playing?
City League.
Traveling squad.
First string.
Traveling squad?
My goodness!
Hey, I'm in sixth.
Most of the other guys are in ninth.
It's all about height.
Yeah, sure.
Play Horse?
-That was pretty. -Not bad.
You on varsity?
I will be.
Coach is such an asshole, though.
Okay, free throw.
-Right here? -Wherever.
That's an "H." Get ready for this one.
That's an "O."
I thought this was Horse.
Okay, buddy.
Ready to go downtown?
Wait a second. It's not your shot.
This ain't the city rec, Ben.
It's not "Ben."
Okay, Ben.
What are we playing to now?
Just play.
Ever seen that in the city rec, Sammy?
In girls'.
Oh, shit!
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
-What's wrong with you? -Jesus Christ, Dad!
Are you okay? Sure?
Can you go one day without making some kind of trouble?
What happened to him?
What do you care?
We were just playing ball.
Really. We were just having fun.
And that's Vincent's.
See?
It's his christening gown.
This is what we brought him home from the hospital in.
Do you want to see yours?
They're so little.
They look like doll clothes.
-What's that smell? -It's cedar.
It's from the chest.
It's supposed to keep moths away.
Haven't you ever smelled it before?
Maybe my grandmother had a chest like this.
What?
Are you remembering something?
Beth, can I see my dad today?
I really want to see him.
Sure.
I already told you. That's why I want to go to my grandma's.
It's what I do for Thanksgiving every year of my life.
It's a very special day for us.
It's a very special day for us too.
My cousins come, my grandma cooks...
...the whole week before.
After turkey, we go outside and play football.
When we come in, we have pie...
...and watch TV with my dad.
The whole family is coming.
Grandma Rosie, Grandpa Angelo--
No! I'm not staying here.
Why do I have to care about them?
You never even met my grandma.
You don't like my dad.
You don't care about what he thinks.
Of course we like George, Sam.
Then let me spend Thanksgiving with him.
The fact is, you're our son.
Not George's. This is one thing we're doing as a family.
-And it's not negotiable. -You just want to show me off.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.
Life magazine! I can't believe...
...the work you're getting.
You know why I'm getting the work.
Because you're the best, kiddo.
Yeah, right.
Same reason Pat's restaurant's always full...
...and Vincent's got a lot of new friends.
Are you saying it's the celebrity?
I think the word is "notoriety."
Where are we eating? And more to the point, drinking?
Do you like clams?
Go this way.
How's it going with Vincent and Sam?
Vincent's so busy getting ready for the basketball tryouts...
...he's ignoring everyone.
Sam probably thinks....
I don't know what Sam thinks. He's still so...
...uncomfortable...
...all the time now. His grades are falling apart.
I don't know.
Well, what's Pat say?
You know Pat. He thinks Sam's going to be fine.
He thinks everything's going to be fine.
And what do you think?
I don't know.
It's just going to take some time.
Do you know what the great Chicago fire of 1871 is?
Peshtigo, there was an even worse fire...
...in the same year on the same day.
Every single building in the town burned.
Hundreds of people died.
But Chicago was a big city...
...so that's the fire everybody paid attention to.
There's a beautiful graveyard. I want to get some shots.
Basically...
...it's the story of what happened. What we talked about in the car.
Look at this, Sam. He was only 14 years old.
That must've been so sad.
But look, 1869.
He died two years before the fire.
Maybe he killed himself, like my mom.
I mean, Cecilia.
Why do you think that?
Here, look through here.
Like, for Cecilia, I think she was just too sad.
So maybe this guy was...
...too sad too, you know?
What do you mean?
There could be worse things than being dead.
Like what?
You know how much we love you.
Yeah, I know you do...
...and Pat and Kerry.
And Vincent too.
Yeah, right.
Really, he's like that with all of us.
He's had a hard time.
What about me?
I love my dad.
And I loved my mom too.
She didn't mean to be sick.
Why do I have to be punished when it wasn't my fault?
Do you know how much I've missed holding you...
...all these years?
And how many years you didn't have me to hug you?
They hugged me.
They hugged me all the time.
Sam, what do you wish?
You can say.
That everything was like it was before.
But that would hurt you and Pat, and I couldn't stand that either.
I don't know.
-Sam's gone. -What do you mean?
He's not in his room. I can't find him.
-Did you look downstairs? -He's not there. I can't find him.
-Did you talk to Vincent? -He's asleep. His door's locked.
-What about Kerry? -She's asleep too.
I'm sorry. He did it again.
What'd he do?
He's been sneaking out and coming to my house.
He crawls into his old bed and sleeps.
Vincent told me he knew all about it.
-You knew? -I brought him back, didn't I?
How long has this been going on?
Not that long.
I had a feeling something was wrong, so this time...
...I brought him back myself.
You knew and didn't tell me?
He's home, okay?
This time, anyhow.
-Go up to your room. -Why?
-What did I do? -You ran away!
You scared the hell out of your mom and me!
That's not going to happen. You understand me?
No, I don't understand. I'm sick of this whole thing!
I don't see why I have to live two blocks from my own house.
I've been trying for three months.
Three months!
You want me to come home, Dad, right?
Come on, tell them.
He's been asking me why can't he live with me.
I told him what his mother did was very wrong.
She didn't know what she was doing.
She was sick.
We know how hard this has been for you.
We know how much you miss George.
But this is your home.
Sam, go upstairs now.
I hate you.
I hate all of you!
You too, Dad, and I'm never coming back!
Jesus, I want to do right by him.
I want him to be happy.
If you can give him the family he deserves...
...goddamn it, you give him that!
But I've never seen him like this before.
He's never been sad more than a day in his life.
Right now, he's the saddest boy in the world.
You know, what happened last night, that's just the tip of it.
I'm going to say this just once.
I love you.
I've been in love with you your whole life.
But you know what I've seen about you?
You've made a career out of being unhappy.
-That is not fair. -But I'm not like that.
If I have a chance to be happy, I'm going to be happy.
Can't you just try and let us all be happy?
What about Sam?
Just keep being a mother to him.
Help him get through this.
He doesn't know who we are.
He doesn't remember us.
We are holding him against his will.
Where are you going with this?
If you think I'm going to lose my kid again--
I can't ignore that because you finally...
...have your life the way you want it.
It's like we are the kidnappers now.
We're not the kidnappers!
Sam will be fine. He'll get through this.
It's you!
Losing your kid once wasn't enough, was it?
You know something?
You're right.
I wasn't there. I let it happen.
It only took a minute, and we've paid for it.
I have and you have...
...and Vincent has, but I don't think that means...
...that Sam has to pay for it too. Does it?
We are where we are.
How we got here doesn't matter. What matters is...
...what do we do now?
Don't push me on this, Beth.
I want to give him back.
I can't do that.
Then I want you to let me do what I have to do.
Can you get your bags okay?
I'll try Jay again, but if we can't get him out...
...for the weekend, I won't have a problem.
Don't you think he's been through enough?
Something's got to get his attention.
Maybe he's doing this to get your attention.
Candy, he's always had my attention.
He is so angry with me.
Things are really bad.
I know. But I think he's right about Vincent.
I can't win with Vincent. He hates me.
He doesn't hate you. What are you talking about? He loves you.
Have you never seen the way that he looks at you?
All he wants you to do is to forgive him.
Forgive him?
For all the shit he's pulled and the shit you don't know he's pulled.
He's so much like you. He takes everything onto himself.
How do you think he's feeling now that Sam is gone?
You okay?
I'm fine.
Do you need anything?
I think you'll have to stay here another day or so.
It's the weekend.
I'm fine.
Headache. It's no big deal.
Do you know how lucky you were?
Mr. Teeter's car was totaled.
-You could've been-- -I don't need this right now.
What are you doing here?
I've been doing fine without you.
I don't think you have been.
I'm sorry.
We're going to get you out of here.
Dad's working on it.
Pat? Jay just called.
He says we can pick Vincent up in the morning.
All right. Thank you.
Can't we get past this?
This isn't just about losing Sam.
What is it about?
Listen to me.
The Sam that's in your head...
...he doesn't exist.
The family that's in your head...
...doesn't exist either.
This family is not in my head.
It's very real.
It's you and me...
...and Kerry and Vincent.
After what he pulled, I pray I find a way...
...to get him through high school in one piece...
...and get him to believe he can get through life without fouling up!
You are right.
You're right about Vincent, but you're wrong about Sam.
You don't know him. You don't want to know him.
And you don't know me anymore either.
I have known you--
Part of you liked it when I was falling apart...
...and you were holding this family together...
...making the decisions. But now...
...I don't need you to pull me out of bed...
...and make me pay attention to the kids.
I have to go to work.
But I do need you.
Why?
Tell me what for.
I need you to love me.
You got a visitor.
Everyone I've ever met in my life has already been here.
Name's Sam Karras.
You gonna see him or not?
So...
...you okay?
They gave me 5 to 10. But I'm reasonably okay.
I'm kidding.
Were you drunk?
I was over-served.
Yeah, Sam, I was drunk.
So what do you want?
I just thought....
I thought we could be friends.
Friends?
Tell me how we can be friends.
You come back. You leave.
You go in and out our window.
I don't know you, Ben.
Sam! Whatever your name is.
You're a concept. You follow me?
-That's not my fault. -"Not my fault"!
You always whine about whose fault it is. Who cares?
Look, I got my own life now.
It's pretty un-fun at the moment. Tell me what you want.
You're my brother.
I missed you.
Sometimes, I even thought I shouldn't have.
Whatever, you're my brother.
You should go now, Sam.
I'm sorry. You're a good kid.
You're fine, but I'm--
-Maybe I'll visit you when I'm out-- -Wait!
I gotta tell you something.
I remembered something.
What do you mean?
Well, when I was at your house...
...Beth showed me this old trunk.
It was full of old baby clothes.
I didn't remember anything.
Yeah. So?
But I remembered the smell.
From being inside the trunk.
Hide-and-seek.
Did that really happen?
Yeah.
You let the lid shut and it caught.
I knew it.
I knew it!
Finally, you came and opened the top.
You were just there.
Not scared or anything.
See? That's what I remember.
What?
That I wasn't scared.
Because I knew you'd come and find me.
What the hell are you doing?
Nothing.
Want to play?
It's midnight and it's cold, in case you haven't noticed.
Yeah. So?
Jesus, Sam! Does George know you're here?
Yeah. Come on down.
You just want to get me arrested again, don't you?
Ever heard of disturbing the peace?
We could play quiet.
What's the matter? Come on!
All right.
What are you waiting for?
-Easy, Sam. -All right.
Losers out to 11, win by 2?
What's the matter? You asleep or something?
This way?
Which way?
Quit fouling me!
You got to say, "beat." You are beat, right?
I let you.
Sure.
Let's call it a night.
Come back tomorrow for a rematch.
Well, the thing is, I'm not going back.
What do you mean?
What are you doing?
George knows.
We talked about it a lot last week.
He knows why I came here so late.
Which is why?
I didn't want to have this whole big thing with you...
...and Beth and Pat.
Sam?
Is this permanent?
I don't know.
I mean, maybe.
If I can.
Jesus, what is this, your cinder block collection?
I was the one.
I let go of your hand.
This thing is heavy.
My dad--
-George helped me carry it. -Did you hear what I said?
Yeah. So what?
I let go of your hand, Sam.
I told you to get lost. That's what I said.
-I said, "Get lost!" -Big deal.
Everybody says stuff like that. "Get lost!"
Here's the deal. Make it-take it to 11.
Gotta win by two.
Loser carries it up alone.
Come on, man!
Are you too tired to play?
Come on, let's go.
They'll wake up the neighborhood.
Let them play.
I just--
Let's get some sleep.
No. Hey, man. I was exercising.
-Bullshit. You were sleeping. -I wasn't.
This kid won't stop lying to me. You still act like you're 6.
Yeah, okay, Dad. I act like I'm 6.
Found a job yet where you work more than one day a week?
I've been looking.
Looking won't pay the rent.
All the money I won from the cab accident...
...is kicking ass in the stock market, so relax.
-Don't blow it on worthless crap. -I won't.
You should spend it on your bar exam.
You're the lawyer. I ain't taking a bar exam.
I got too much other shit going on.
I don't know what happened to you.
How're things going with your girlfriend, Vanessa?
Things are going fine.
Shit!
I gotta go.
Shit! You turned off the alarm clock again.
No! I mean, yes, I did, but I thought you needed more sleep.
I shouldn't have stayed here. That was a jerk thing to do.
Why are you going to work? It's Sunday.
I'm not going to work. I'm going to brunch with potential clients.
That's how a party planner gets business, by making contacts.
Meet with me. I'll order in from Cozy's. We'll have fun.
I am sick of Cozy's. You order in from there all the time.
I am sick of Cozy's. You order in from there all the time. The delivery guy's your best friend.
He happens to be pretty damn nice.
This is a rough patch in my life.
Syracuse is 0 and 3. And I got those medical problems.
Medical problems? A cab runs over your foot two years ago. You're hospitalized one night.
A cab runs over your foot two years ago. You're hospitalized one night.
First of all, that cab was huge.
And a jury decided that one night of pain was worth $200,000.
-So there you go. -Whatever.
Why are you being so nuts to me lately?
You refuse to move on to the next phase.
I'd like to have a family someday. I need someone I can rely on, not a playmate.
I need someone I can rely on, not a playmate.
You need a father figure? "Stop pulling your sister's hair!"
You know what? I'm gonna go to Syracuse to see my mom.
-I'll be back on Wednesday. -What are you talking about?
I had call for delivery, but it was crank call. You want chocolate cake?
Come back later. I'll Indian wrestle you.
You're going down, sucker.
We'll see about that.
Okay. Peace, out.
You're going to Syracuse?
I need time to think and so do you.
Think about what?
Your life and why I should be a part of it.
-All right. -While you're at it...
-All right. -While you're at it... ...think about getting a real job.
I got a real job!
Patrick Ewing, nice shot.
-Hey, Sonny. -What's up, buddy boy?
-Hey, Sonny. -What's up, buddy boy? I'm out the door. Hey, pal.
-Where you going? -Manhattan.
You wanna take me with you?
All right, I guess.
Hold on to your money. Later on.
Okay, take care, Sonny.
See you.
Cadillac, I love it.
Surprise!
Just ignore him.
It's only Sonny. It's only Sonny.
Yeah, it's only me. It's only me.
-What's going on? -Corinne's going-away party for Kevin.
She didn't tell me. The roommate has a right to know.
She knew you'd ruin the surprise.
No, I wouldn't.
Hey, surprise.
Surprise. -Surprise. -Surprise.
-Surprise. -Surprise.
What's going on?
We wasted the good surprise on you.
All right.
Is this your handiwork?
I guess.
See you in three hours.
Good to see you stiffs. What've you been doing?
Last three weeks have been crazy. I've been in Denver, Dallas--
I'm sleeping in the office. We're going to trial on the fraud case.
Honey, it was a great surprise. I was totally shocked.
No, you weren't! And I worked so hard on this.
Need some help?
-Honey, your sister's here. -Hey, sweetie.
I hate Sonny.
My client's out $7 million. All we can sue on is breach of contract.
Maybe you can sue under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
I gotta get back to the office. You're the king.
Mikey, a pleasure.
-I'll see you at home. -All right.
I'll walk you out.
I gotta admit, I'm still weirded out when they kiss.
Why? They're gay. That's what gay guys do.
I know, but they were like brothers to us back in school.
They're still like our brothers. Our very, very gay brothers.
What are you doing after this? Going to a Klan meeting?
Remember when Dad had that barbecue... ...for his friends and it rained...
...for his friends and it rained...
...so he and Mom went into the kitchen and made... ...100 hamburgers with one frying pan?
You're not gonna let a little rain stop you from making 100 hamburgers.
That relationship's lasted longer than I thought it would.
Look at his eyes. He's bored. I give it two more weeks.
Hey, excuse me. Everybody!
I'm sorry. I wanted to thank you for coming tonight.
I guess I should say--
I'm getting it. Tomorrow I'm leaving for China...
I'm getting it. Tomorrow I'm leaving for China... ...to represent the firm of Morton and Mandel.
Me, the same guy who once shaved his ass to win a $5 bet.
Prove it!
Just kidding.
But I am real glad you're all here tonight, because...
...I'm gonna do what I never thought I'd have the guts to do.
You're not proposing, are you?
-Yeah, pal, I am. -Well, think about it, you know?
God, Sonny, shut up!
Anyway, will you?
Yeah.
Good call on the two weeks.
Sonny, what was that all about?
Congratulations. You and Big Boobs McGee are gonna be happy.
Don't call her that.
You wanna tell your children you met their mother as a waitress at Hooters?
Sonny, that was five years ago. She's a doctor now... ...and my fiancée, so from now on...
...and my fiancée, so from now on... ...Dr. Big Boobs McGee.
-Congratulations. -Thanks, man.
I just...
...got shit going on.
What's the matter?
Vanessa's gonna break up with me... ...and I don't know how to make her wanna stay.
She's getting older. She wants different things.
Career, stable relationship, a family.
That's how they get.
I want things to go back to the way they used to be.
When we were at Syracuse, and Vanessa worshiped you.
-That was nice. -Nobody hassled you to get a job.
-That was nice. -Nobody hassled you to get a job. Tommy and Phil showered separately.
Those were the days.
-What're you doing? -If I make this...
...Vanessa will realize she likes me the way I am.
You're going to the putt. Remember, the roof breaks to the right.
Yes! That's what I'm talk--
Good God!
That can't be good.
Where's Kevin?
He already left. I guess he forgot to say goodbye to you.
-Why are you here? -I'm cleaning because you're useless.
Then what, you gonna go to your Hooters reunion?
You guys talk about whose ass hangs out of their shorts the most?
At least I can fit my ass in my shorts, fatty.
Speaking of fatty, whose is this?
-I don't know. -I'm eating it then.
"We wasted the good surprise on you."
Yeah?
Lady gave me $5 to bring him here.
-What do you mean? -Later.
Are you selling raffle tickets?
Oh, boy.
-Kevin Gerrity. -I got something to tell you.
-What's up? -There's a kid here.
What kind of kid?
If this note is true, it's your kid.
What do you mean?
I'm having a tough time reading this...
...but it says, "Dear Kevin: This is Julian, your son.
I hope you understand why I didn't tell you until now...
...but he needs your help. I can't be his mother anymore."
-This is ridiculous. -Hang on.
Who's this?
This is my friend.
-Is that Kevin on the phone? -No, it's my Uncle Remus.
Hi. What's your name?
Is he all right?
He doesn't like you. Leave us alone.
You're such a dick.
That was your girlfriend. She was acting "Hooterific."
-Who sent that note? -"Jan."
Jan.... I don't know any Jan.
-Where's he from? -Where are you from?
Buffalo.
I've never even been to Buffalo.
Maybe it's a mistake.
Is this like the time you said my parents were dead?
I swear, he's right here.
I'm coming home. I don't know what I'll say--
Hang on. It says...
..."If you won't take responsibility for him, they found a foster family--"
Yes, Uncle Remus, I know the catfish are huge.
That's terrific.
Here's a number for a guy...
...at City Social Service. Arthur Brooks. I'll call.
-I'll come home. -I'll take care of it.
Are you sure?
Yeah, don't worry.
Hooters. Hooters. Hooters!
-All right. Thanks a lot. -Later.
I'm gonna make another phone call. You want to come and sit down, pal?
Or you can stand there. Anything you want. I'll be a minute.
Social Services is closed today, Columbus Day.
We'll be open tomorrow at 8 a.m.
Columbus Day.
Boy, I don't know what to tell you.
Everything's gonna get figured out tomorrow.
Can you be a tough little guy until then?
Great.
Do I need to get you a bottle of formula or something?
-No. -What do you eat?
Food.
Yeah? I eat food too.
What--? Come on.
You need me to hold your hand?
On Mondays, I go to Central Park and watch rollerbladers fall down.
-You into that? -I don't know.
Watch. This guy's humming.
He's going down, he's going down, he's going--!
How old are you, anyways?
-Five. -Five?
You wear a diaper?
No.
-You wipe your own ass then? -Yes.
You do? Good job. That's cool.
Come on, fall down. Fall down. Yes! Come on, damn it.
You suck. You suck!
Check this out.
My God!
There's a stick there. Somebody should move it.
All right now, what way would you put that on?
This Columbo, he pretends to be stupid... ...but he's really smart as a tack.
Oh, yeah, he is.
I wipe my own ass.
Me too.
So, Mr. Ass Wiper, what's this guy's name?
Scuba Steve.
Does he ever take his flippers off?
What if he goes bowling? They don't make him wear bowling shoes? He wears flippers?
They don't make him wear bowling shoes? He wears flippers?
-Really? -I had a doll like that at one time.
-Really? -I had a doll like that at one time. But my cat, he bite his head off.
What cat would do that?
You calling me a liar?
Hey, take it easy.
Anyways... ...Jets are playing tonight. We're gonna go to the Blarney Stone. Wanna come?
We're gonna go to the Blarney Stone. Wanna come?
I've got more deliveries.
Maybe you can also finish the turkey on your lip.
Right there.
Let's crank up the Styx.
No music during the game.
-It's halftime. Relax, Mr. Herlihy. -Goddamn Jets.
What are you doing in here, cutie?
Watching football.
-Who do you want to win? -The goddamn Jets.
Have fun.
Too bad you don't like girls. I think you could've had her.
-I'm thirsty. -You're thirsty?
-Are you allowed soda? -I don't know.
My mom always said soda rots your teeth...
...but you'll lose them anyway, so rot on.
-Can we get two root beers? -Sure.
When I graduated law school, we met here every Monday to watch football.
Who would meet you?
My friends, Vanessa.
Vanessa always rooted against the team...
...I wanted to win just to bust my chops.
But everybody's so busy with their crap lately, no one comes.
Like I'm not busy?
Shut up or I'll smack you through the wall like last Monday.
Last Monday was a fluke. Bring it on, woman.
Anytime.
He drinks a lot of soda.
I'm telling you, buddy. Vanessa, she's the one. I can't lose her.
I'm not getting any handsomer.
Every day I get a little bit older and balder and fatter.
-Fatter? -At your age...
-Fatter? -At your age... ...I could eat anything. Wouldn't gain an ounce.
Now, I have a chocolate shake, my ass jiggles for a week.
-Enjoy the metabolism while you got it. -Metalobism?
Good God, it's 2:30 in the morning. You must be wrecked.
Anyways, I had fun today. Did you have fun?
Yeah, you're all right.
Have a good one.
Sonny?
Could I have a night-light?
Night-light? I think I can help you out. Hang on.
There you go, all right?
Sonny?
Are you my dad?
No, I'm not, but...
...that Dad and Mom thing we'll figure out in the morning.
You just go to sleep.
-Good night. -Good night.
Go get the can, okay?
Go! Go! Go!
I'm thinking about keeping the kid.
Sonny.
Remember when we went to the pet store... ...and you wanted that puppy, but I reminded you about feeding it...
...and you wanted that puppy, but I reminded you about feeding it... ...cleaning it and toilet training it?
...cleaning it and toilet training it?
This is kind of like that, except with a human.
I mean, I'm glad you had fun and all, but this is big.
I gotta do something big. I think Vanessa will respect that.
You think that since women get pregnant... ...to fix a troubled relationship...
...why can't a guy adopt a kid to do the same?
I didn't think of it like that. But yes, that's what I'm thinking.
Sounds nuts to me, pal. Do yourself a favor. Sleep on it.
You're right. Can I use your phone?
Arthur Brooks speaking.
How you doing? Kevin Gerrity.
Right on, Mr. Gerrity.
We were expecting you.
Do you still got a foster family lined up for Julian?
Yes, we do.
I've decided to take care of the little guy.
Way to sleep on it, pal.
You two want to get married, I support that.
When parents take the responsibility, there's no bigger high for us.
I'm psyched about it too.
So that's it.
Yep. Good luck to you and your son.
My son.
Goddamn stick!
That's my boy.
Hey.
Go back to sleep.
Well, I'm going back to sleep. Nighty-night.
I wet my bed.
Oh, God.
That's a shitload of piss.
Okay.
There you go, all right? No more wet mess.
Sleep, all right? Just try to sleep. Stay asleep.
Sit still!
Lay!
All right! I'm up!
It smells like urine in this joint. Good job.
What're you doing there, boy?
Making cereal.
Oh, yeah? Why don't you pour me a bowl?
Or don't pour me a bowl. Either way.
I got it. I got it.
We can fix this.
It's not a big deal.
Look. See? See how quick it goes away?
Crybaby, come on. Don't worry about it, boy.
Scuba Steve, damn you!
You think that's funny, me getting hurt?
There's a bright side to being up before 11: McDonald's breakfast.
I haven't been up for that in 10 years. You wanna go?
Tie your shoes, we'll go. Hurry.
It's like 12 blocks from here, so tie quickly.
Do you need help with that?
I can do it.
Let me do it.
You loop it, you swoop it, and you pull.
You loop it, you swoop it, you pull.
Good. Let's go. We're in a hurry.
It's different for your generation. You've always had McDonald's breakfast available.
I have?
When I was born, all we had were the burgers and fries.
Maybe the fish sandwich. I'm not sure. I'll get back to you.
What are you doing?
Oh, yeah, the hand-holding thing.
My dad took us to McDonald's the first morning they had breakfast.
Everybody was baffled. "Are these sausages or hamburgers?"
I have to go to the bathroom.
We're gonna be there in a minute.
I gotta go now.
Didn't you pee enough in bed?
We only got nine minutes to get there.
But I gotta go to the bathroom.
All right, let's go.
Can my kid use the bathroom for a minute?
Customers only.
He's just a kid. We'll be in and out.
That's not my problem.
It's not your problem? All right.
Come on.
I can't do it.
What do you mean, you can't do it? Just go.
I'm scared. Could you do it too?
All right.
Here we go.
And we're off.
That's not too difficult, right?
And we're both losing weight.
Good job. We're gonna miss breakfast. Let's go.
Put it away.
-Thanks, anyways. -Sure thing. Anytime.
Move your ass there, pee-boy. We only got five minutes, five minutes. Now four.
We only got five minutes, five minutes. Now four.
Come on. We're almost there.
Hey, mister. Why are you sitting on the ground?
This is where I live.
-We gotta get going. -Why?
In retrospect, I made some bad choices after high school.
-We gotta get going. -Why?
This was during the so-called Disco Era...
...but for me, it was more the Doing Mushrooms Era.
-We're gonna miss breakfast. -Why?
I never thought about that.
I was never Mr. Popularity in high school...
...and I watched Fantasia a lot. -One day it clicked. -Hey, yappy.
-One day it clicked. -Hey, yappy. If you end it, you get an Egg McMuffin.
How about a Sausage McMuffin with hash browns?
You got a deal.
Look, look. He fell asleep. Let's go.
Sausage McMuffin.
Pardon me, sir.
How you doing?
What can I get for you?
-What do you want? -Cheerios.
They don't got Cheerios.
Lasagna.
What's the matter? We'll take hotcakes and sausage.
Sorry. We stopped serving breakfast.
We're four seconds late.
You're 30 minutes and four seconds late. Breakfast stops at 10:30.
Horseshit!
Don't cry. Sorry. I was cursing at the lady, not you.
Nice parenting.
Thanks. Are you my therapist? Take a walk.
Do you want a Happy Meal?
You got a Happy Meal?
Will somebody get the kid a Happy Meal?!
Relax.
Where's my Egg McMuffin?
Breakfast is over at 10:30.
-Really? I thought it was 11. -I thought that too.
Total mind blower.
Will you just relax? Here. What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do? You're gonna meet Vanessa tonight. You'll like her.
You're gonna meet Vanessa tonight. You'll like her.
You wanna see me get hurt? That'll cheer you up?
All right.
You think that's funny?
Good. No more crying.
Are you okay?
Next time, kill me.
Let's do it, Rangers. --Rangers against the Tampa Bay Lightning.
...it's as close as you can get to a must-win game for the Rangers.
-How you doing? -How you doing?
-You like hockey? -You like hockey?
This is a big, important game.
This is a big, important game.
-Cut the crap. -Cut the crap.
I'm serious. Don't do that.
I'm serious. Don't do that.
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck... ...if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
That's what I thought. Shut up.
Don't you take naps?
Sometimes.
Go take a nap.
I'm too hungry to sleep.
You want some food?
Having a kid is great...
...as long as his eyes are closed and he's not moving or speaking.
How you doing? You sleepwalking?
Why don't you go back sleepy? Sleepy. Keep napping. What's this?
Keep napping. What's this? Kangaroo song.
That's terrific. And we'll watch this after the game, okay?
But after my nap, I always watch the kangaroo song.
It's overtime, and there's a penalty shot about to take place.
It happens every 10 years--
Kangaroo song. Kangaroo song!
All right!
God! You were normal yesterday.
I can't take this. Are you serious?
What do you say?
Douche-bag kangaroo.
Are you all hopped out?
I don't know what to do. Hopefully Vanessa will.
I think she's back. If she's not back, we'll wait for her.
I think she's back. If she's not back, we'll wait for her. Get your coat. Clean up.
Oh, God. You don't have to pee, do you?
-Do you swear? -I swear.
How come you're not going?
I don't have to go. Only you and my grandfather go every 30 seconds.
Let's hurry it up, all right? I'm keeping you company.
He'll write your name on the wall. Mind your business.
Let's go. Let's go.
Why do I need to meet this lady?
-Now it is your problem. -Thank you.
She's that lady I was telling you about.
She's gonna be a big part of your life.
I'm scared. What if she's not nice?
Look.
See these right here? These are magic sunglasses, okay?
If you're afraid, put them on to become invisible.
Really? Nobody can see me?
Put them on.
Sonny, I'm right here.
Oh, the glasses. I couldn't see you.
Keep those on. No one can notice you until you decide they can.
-Okay. -Let's go.
I'm still right here.
Okay, all right, the glasses.
Welcome back.
-Who's that? -Who's who? He's invisible.
-Can I come in? -Sure.
Any invisible people out here... ...feel free to come in, okay?
Sonny, I don't really know what's going on right now. -We should talk-- -You said I got some thinking to do?
-We should talk-- -You said I got some thinking to do? So I did it.
Just because I don't have a job doesn't mean I don't wanna move on.
Instead of saying that, I figured I'd show you.
-Before you say anything-- -Look at that.
He took his sunglasses off.
He wants you to see him. He likes you.
Julian, come here.
Come here, pal.
Vanessa... ...I want you to meet Julian, my son.
Our son. I adopted him.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Is someone in the bathroom?
Why is the door shut?
-I don't know. -You don't?
-I don't know. -Sonny.
I can't believe this.
-Hey. Open up. -Sonny.
Hello. Open the door!
-Is everything okay? -Oh, my God.
I'm sorry. I was freaking out there. -I'm Sonny. -Sid.
-I'm Sonny. -Sid.
I had an attack of paranoia. I thought you were sleeping with my girl.
I am.
What's that?
I am.
That's what I was trying to tell you before. I found someone.
-This old guy? -Sid.
He's already achieved so much... ...and yet he's still goal-oriented and still focused.
And he has a five-year plan.
What is it? "Don't die"?
I can't believe this. We got a family now. This is what you wanted.
You surprising me with a kid that you adopted...
You surprising me with a kid that you adopted... -...wasn't what I wanted. -I did this for you.
-...wasn't what I wanted. -I did this for you.
You wanted me to be more responsible. I can't raise this kid alone.
You remind me of my grandson. You don't think things through.
Hey, Old Man River, zip it or I'll break your hip.
-I'd like to see you try it. -Shut up.
How'd you misconstrue the situation so badly?
I don't know.
Deep down you must've known this day was coming.
You made the biggest mistake of your life.
I know you'll be missing me when you got... ...that big, white, wrinkly... ...body on top of you...
...with his loose skin... ...and old balls. Gross.
Excuse me. How you doing? I'm Kevin Gerrity.
I got an emergency problem. Is Arthur Brooks around?
I'll go get him for you.
Stay where I can see you. I gotta talk to this guy.
Mr. Gerrity? -Arthur Brooks. -How are you?
I need to speak with you.
I didn't tell you to come here, did I? I was gonna mail you the paperwork.
It's like the opposite of that. Look, I can't manage this kid.
I ain't a good father. I made a big mistake.
-Mistake? -I had a mother lined up for him...
-Mistake? -I had a mother lined up for him... ...but she's banging the Pepperidge Farm guy.
The kid won't stop peeing and throwing up. He's like a cocker spaniel. I just....
He's like a cocker spaniel. I just.... He'd be better off with his natural mother.
Well, she passed away last night, Mr. Gerrity.
She had cancer. She must have sensed... ...that her time was running short.
She wanted her son to be with the natural father.
Loop. Pull.
If you don't wanna take care of him...
...we'll take him. But he'll have to chill in a group home.
Group home? Like an orphanage?
We don't call them that.
Look, I did it. Loop, swoop and pull.
You did do it. Congratulations, kid.
I showed him that.
Why don't you go back over there, okay?
-I'll call the Heatherton Home-- -Let's do this.
-I'll call the Heatherton Home-- -Let's do this. I'll hang on to the kid until you find him a new family.
I'll hang on to the kid until you find him a new family.
I don't know. I gotta watch out for the kid's best interest.
I don't know. I gotta watch out for the kid's best interest. You said yourself you were a bogus dad.
He's better off with me than in an orphanage.
I don't wanna put him in a home any more than you do.
Why don't we pretend you didn't even come in here?
I'll give you a shout when I line up a family.
-That's good. -Later.
Just don't make me regret this.
Where are we going now?
I gotta make a phone call. Just stay right here, all right?
-This is a collect call from: -Your baby boy.
-To accept charges, say, "Yes." -Yeah, I'll accept.
Dad, how's it going? How's Florida?
Not too bad. Your mother got a sunburn playing tennis.
-I got some interesting news. -Oh, yeah? What?
Kind of adopted a kid.
What do you mean?
I'm talking about you being a grandfather.
Who the hell would give you a kid?
Social Services.
You idiot. You better give that kid back.
His mother's.... Hang on.
Go play with them pigeons, buddy.
I tried to give him back. I just can't. All right?
I need your help. I'm in a bad way. Vanessa dumped me. I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm in a bad way. Vanessa dumped me. I don't know what I'm doing.
You're damn right.
The kid is always around. He never leaves me alone.
You'd think he'd want some privacy. I'm in deep shit.
Give that kid back before you ruin both your lives.
I appreciate that.
He's better off living in a dumpster.
I'll be a better father than you!
Impossible! All you care about is yourself!
Yeah? No, I care about you saving money on this call!
Let's eat.
The Vanessa thing did not work out.
She lost her damn mind. That wasn't your fault, though, okay?
Okay.
I know when you first got here... ...you thought you were gonna meet your dad.
...you thought you were gonna meet your dad. But I don't think that's gonna happen.
-Why? -I don't know.
But, buddy, real dads aren't always that great.
I got one and he's out of his mind.
He tells me what to do. He never lets me figure stuff out on my own.
A lot of dads are like that. That's why people grow up nuts.
Look at this guy.
He was probably a nice boy like you. Then his dad messed his mind up.
Who won the Jets game?
Who cares?
Let it go. He can't control you anymore.
What do you mean?
-You know. -You're a loser.
You're mad at your dad, not at me! I forgive you!
I am. I am. I hate my father.
I don't want it to be like that. I don't wanna control you.
-You even like your name? -I guess.
You guess? Shouldn't you like your name?
It'll be your name the rest of your life.
What do you want?
Frankenstein.
I can deal with that. I'll call you Frankenstein.
Frankenstein, you gonna play in the puddle?
Go ahead. From now on, you do whatever you wanna do.
I'll show you some cool shit along the way.
That's what it's all about.
Stay in front of it. Don't be scared.
It's coming right at you.
Okay. All right.
You're picking your head up. Don't do that.
Is this okay?
That's what you wanna wear?
That's okay with me then.
Good luck walking down the street.
Way to block it. Stay with it.
You're the next Willie Randolph.
Chief Jay Strongbow used to do a sleeper hold.
Put your arm under here.
Lift this arm, okay? Slide under and try to lock wrists.
Let me show you. Watch.
Throw him into the ropes and he comes back....
Get him. Get him. Lock him up. Lock wrists.
You bring him down slow. Apply pressure.
He's going to sleep now.
See, he's out.
Wake up.
You'll be the only kid your age with a slingshot.
Go have some fun. Shoot a few beer cans or something.
You like that?
Sonny, Sonny, come here!
What is it? What's the matter?
Let me have that.
Go to your room. I think. Or do whatever you want.
It's gonna be fun. You nervous?
No? You're excited, aren't you?
Let's go. Up, up, up.
Here comes some candy.
How you doing?
Happy Halloween! We got a first-timer.
Do the right thing, buddy. We want some candy!
Hang on right here for a second. Don't move.
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, CDs. You like that?
He's not happy. What else you got?
Okay, that's good. Trick-or-treat.
-Say, "Happy Halloween." -Happy Halloween.
Thank you.
Next year, be prepared, moron.
What's with the cummerbund?
I let him wear whatever he wants.
Those boots are the best.
I think they're Kevin's.
I'll have a hot dog with the mustard and a knish.
Frankenstein, what do you want?
Thirty packets of ketchup.
All right. Thirty packets of ketchup.
Nice cut, pal.
Frankenstein. Do that thing I taught you the other day.
It took him 20 minutes to learn that. He's quick. He's smart.
-And he loves ketchup. -He does.
-And he loves ketchup. -He does. This is a whole new school of child raising.
You give him options, not orders. Let him make the decision.
You're a pioneer.
-So you two just chill out all day? -Basically.
Hung out on the monkey bars. The kid did eight chin-ups.
I can't even do one with these scrawny arms.
They're not scrawny. They're nice.
What do you wanna do tomorrow?
I wanna go to school.
I don't force him, he makes the right decision. Way to go.
I don't force him, he makes the right decision. Way to go. We'll enroll you on Monday. Enjoy the weekend.
We'll enroll you on Monday. Enjoy the weekend.
Do the thing again.
That one touched the ground.
That was awesome!
Good job.
Help me! Help me!
Please help me. I don't know where I live.
This isn't a big problem. We'll find your parents.
-What's your name? -Frankenstein.
-Frankenstein. Okay. -There you are.
There you are. Are you okay, buddy?
I turn my head and he disappeared.
Don't you ever do that to me again. Don't do that.
Thank you for being sweet to my little boy.
-You're welcome, Sonny. -Sonny?
I think my sister, Corinne, is engaged to your roommate.
Your sister's Corinne? That sucks.
Yeah, I'm up from D.C. I was at that party...
...where we wasted the good surprise on you.
Sorry about that.
So, what, you have a son now?
I'm not his dad. I'm more of a father-figure type...
...until Social Services can get another family.
At which point, you'll find a new way... ...to initiate conversations with girls in the park.
Yeah, that's correct.
Good job, buddy!
He's peeing on his own.
Keep it flowing! That's it!
Go! Go!
So does Corinne's sister have a name?
-It's Layla. -Layla? I like your song.
Could you do me a favor? Could you hang out with me?
He'll think he's a failure if he couldn't get me a date.
I really can't.
I have a ton of work to do.
I see. Hang on a second.
Come here.
Layla, if you don't come over to Sonny's apartment tonight...
...there's a good chance I'll develop a stutter.
P-P-P-Please don't do this to me.
-That is so cheap. -What?
So I'm working in a tollbooth now.
I originally wanted to be a male model...
...but I'm not very good-looking, so that didn't work out.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm all right. I'm recovering.
This is my favorite part of the song right here.
Better keep it down low. The kid's gonna wake up.
Sonny!
Too late.
Okay. Just hang out a little bit. I'll be right back. Don't go sneaking out.
-What are you doing? -You forgot to say good night.
What do you mean?
I can't go to sleep until you say good night.
I didn't know that. I'm sorry. Good night.
Go to sleep now, all right?
What'd we learn about girls?
Initiating the conversation is half the battle.
Bingo. Now sleep, okay?
I gave him NyQuil. He should be out for the night.
This is Styx. They've been my favorite band since I was 12.
You're kidding me.
No, I can't help it. I just love them.
My friends make fun of me.
My friends make fun of me too. I've seen them 25 times.
Tommy Shaw, when I was 16, I was at the concert...
...and he reached down, pulled me on stage.
-I did the robot voice for "Mr. Roboto." -Really?
No, I made that up. I'm sorry. That would've been cool, right?
My cousin's friends with their drummer...
...so when they come to town, we go to dinner...
...and they tell us stories from the road.
-Really? -No, I made that up again too.
-Really? -No, I made that up again too. I'm sorry.
You're not attracted to, like, 60-year-old guys, are you?
-No. -Yeah, I don't like them either.
I can't sleep.
Okay. He can't sleep.
So the rabbit ran across the street...
...because he thought he saw some carrots.
But when he got across the street... ...it turned out they weren't carrots, they were peanuts.
Peanuts?
The peanuts belonged to a squirrel...
...who had taken them home from a baseball game.
And then the rabbit thought to himself...
..."Carrots, peanuts, what's the difference?"
So he asked the squirrel if he could have some.
And the squirrel said, "Of course."
And the rabbit was very happy to make such a nice new friend.
And so was the squirrel.
And the rabbit thought the squirrel had pretty hair.
And nice eyes also.
And the squirrel thought the rabbit was really nice too.
And then, the rabbit worked up his courage...
...and asked the squirrel if he could have... ...just the littlest squirrel kiss.
And the squirrel thought it just wasn't the right time...
...in her busy squirrel life to be kissing any rabbits...
...even though this particular rabbit was very sweet.
And the rabbit got shut down, did he?
That's all right. But he was still thinking maybe...
That's all right. But he was still thinking maybe... ...Scuba Steve could get a squirrel kiss...
...Scuba Steve could get a squirrel kiss... ...so somebody's getting some action.
Good night, Scuba Steve.
Good night, Frankenstein.
Good night, Sonny.
Good night, Layla.
Don't get caught with any girls.
It's your first day. Take it slow.
I'll meet you after school at 2:30, right out front.
You're not staying?
No, I gotta go get you some more ketchup.
I don't like these kids.
I don't either, but shouldn't we give them a chance?
How's this?
Here are the magic sunglasses. You put them on if you feel scared, okay?
I lost you.
I don't know where you are. I'm sorry.
Oh, there you go.
You go inside and make some friends.
Oh, yeah, that's a good hug.
All right. Go inside. I'm gonna miss you.
Hi, I like your hat. What's your name?
-Might as well-- -Leave a message!
-Might as well-- -Leave a message!
Mr. Gerrity, this is Arthur Brooks from Social Services. I got good news.
We may have found a family for Julian.
Give me a call back as soon as possible... ...so we can set up a meeting. Bye.
Sierra Club Legal Department.
Can I speak to Layla Maloney?
Layla, line four.
-Hello? -You're a lawyer?
What are you doing?
Waiting for Julian so I can have somebody to play with.
-What are you doing? -I'm swamped.
-What are you doing? -I'm swamped. I gotta do my laundry on my lunch hour.
I was gonna do my laundry today too. Where are you going?
There's a place nearby, Suds, on Bleecker.
I know that place. Maybe I'll see you there then.
Maybe. I gotta go.
I bought tickets and the show was the night before.
Maybe it was a mistake.
That's nice, but you don't know what's going down on the streets.
It's hard to know what's going down... ...when you're in an office seven days a week, Mr. Tollbooth.
...when you're in an office seven days a week, Mr. Tollbooth.
You're not gonna tell me to get a real job.
No. You're a big boy. It's cool you only work one day a week.
These are the cutest things I've ever seen.
I know. I have them in yellow. I wear them when I work out.
It's great what you're doing with Julian while you got him.
Yeah, well, I got him.
I read an article that said...
...the most important influences in a kid's life are his friends.
They said that?
Just hope he's not hanging out with drug dealers...
Just hope he's not hanging out with drug dealers... ...and delinquents in school.
I'm kidding.
I know. I know.
Man, this Yoo-Hoo is good. You know what else is good?
Smoking dope.
I ain't going to rat you out. Puffing the cheeba.
Go by the seesaw, smoke a J. You know what I'm talking about?
I have a bellybutton.
You have a bellybutton? We all have bellybuttons.
And we all love Yoo-Hoo. Especially with a little rum.
-What's rum? -You don't know?
Rumpelstiltskin?
Rumpelstiltskin. Rumpelstiltskin's a good man. So are you guys.
Stay clean. Stay focused. Frankenstein, have fun with your friends.
Frankenstein, have fun with your friends.
Why are you scratching so much?
I have ecza....
Eczema? Gross.
How do I make it stop itching?
I don't know. You scratch it.
Spaghetti-O's. Do you like Spaghetti-O's?
Dented cans are half price.
Microsoft went down three points. We gotta save some money.
Here, give it a shot.
That's it, boy.
Put it in there. Feels good.
Hi, Sonny. Hi, Sonny's friend.
His name's Frankenstein.
Hi, Frankenstein. Remember me?
Help me. I'm lost. I don't know where I am.
You don't gotta do that.
You guys wear the same size T-shirt. That's cool.
I heard you did laundry with my sister.
She said we did laundry?
Where I'm from, it's called doing the hibbity-dibbity.
I got eczema.
Well, then you shouldn't scratch it.
Don't tell him what to do. He can scratch.
-Scratch. -Is that better?
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
You know about kids? I thought you were a foot doctor.
It's not doctor stuff. It's common sense. Scratching spreads rashes.
This is something you learned at Hooters.
-What the hell is he doing? -He's shopping.
Microsoft went down three points.
That's good. See you later, Frankenstein.
Stay away from the frozen-food section. Your boobs'll harden.
Isn't Little Italy the greatest?
I like it. Everyone always tells me to hang out in the Village and SoHo.
That's all right.
But you gotta respect a place where the fatter you are, the cooler you are.
Last time, he was with a different girl. I guess he ate her.
I went to Coney Island today with the little boy. You gotta take a look at this.
We had a blast together.
He's so happy.
He is such a good boy.
If I have a kid of my own, I hope he's half as cool as that kid.
Is he picking your nose?
Yeah, he was picking his own all day... -...so I figured he could borrow mine. -Sweet.
He must be miserable without you right now.
No, he's in good hands.
Look at Brad's body. Not an ounce of fat on it.
-What? -Don't worry. I like yours better.
I got two queens, two jacks and an ace.
-I win. -Why do you win?
I got a two, a four, a 10, an eight and a six.
I don't understand. Why do you win?
-Because I win. -What's the name of that game?
I win.
I'll get it!
-What's up? -I'm looking for Kevin Gerrity.
He's in China. Who are you?
Arthur Brooks, New York City Social Services. I'm confused.
Chinatown. He loves those egg rolls.
I've tried contacting him several times and he hasn't responded.
I'm concerned.
Ix-nay on the ketchup-nay.
-Have him call me. -All right.
My body's definitely better than his.
Without question.
It took you a long time to pencil me in. You work all the time.
I know. I'm excited.
You're excited. How long you been this crazy?
I guess ever since I was a little girl.
See, my mom got married really young and pretty much just raised us kids.
So when my dad took off... ...she wasn't left with a lot of options.
And I think that's when I decided...
...that I never wanted to end up in that situation.
That's actually a good reason to be working.
I guess I feel like I gotta kick ass while there's ass to be kicked.
You kick that ass during the day, but at night you have fun with Sonny.
The best of times
Are when I'm alone with you
Some rain, some shine
Two guys you were best friends with in law school... ...fell in love with each other?
...fell in love with each other? Is that strange for you?
No. Nothing changed, really. They watch a different kind of porno now. But that's it.
They watch a different kind of porno now. But that's it.
My God! This is Corinne's place?
If the girls at Hooters could see her now.
-Do you want your ass kicked? -I'm just kidding around, Layla.
You're afraid to get involved and you got a lot of work, but...
...when I'm not with you, I'm thinking of you. Do you have that going on?
Maybe.
Maybe we should try a kiss out.
We owe it to ourselves to see if we should move to the next level.
I'm not sure.
Me either. It's just that you kissed Scuba Steve.
Ever since then, he's strutted around bragging... ..."I got a kiss the first night. After three times, you got nothing."
..."I got a kiss the first night. After three times, you got nothing."
-He said that? -Come on.
Let's just give it a shot just so I can have some dignity. All right?
Oh, my God!
Gross!
Did I witness the first kiss?
Yeah, you did. Thanks a lot for showing up.
Layla, you didn't actually enjoy that, did you?
I don't know. I'm going upstairs.
Wash your mouth out. He's dirty. And he's poor.
What do you got in the bag, Corinne? Some chicken wings? Booby tassels?
Shut up.
You have a good sleep.
Pleasant Hooters.
Come on, come on!
This is where we hang our jackets. This is my hook.
That's a capertillar.
A caterpillar.
-That's right, a capertillar. -Capertillar, all right.
-Staying clean, pal? -Yes.
You drink the booze, you lose. Remember that, punk.
I'm Julian's teacher, Ms. Foote. -You his father? -I'm Kevin Gerrity.
-You his father? -I'm Kevin Gerrity.
Do you have some time to go over some things... -...that have been bothering me? -Sure.
-...that have been bothering me? -Sure.
Go take a walk, pal.
Julian has been displaying some odd behavior.
He spilled glue on the floor and didn't tell anyone.
He covered it with newspaper.
And then one of our students wore Rollerblades for show-and-tell.
And Julian tripped him with a stick.
I've never--
Julian found it hilarious.
I like him to express himself freely.
I've really never seen any problems with that.
Your boy's making the least progress of any of the children.
Frankly, his personal hygiene is becoming a cause for concern.
He's the smelly kid in class? I let him become the smelly kid?
What's wrong with me?
I've had some smelly ones before.
But your son is by far the smelliest.
All right, I got you. What do you think I should do?
Start by paying more attention to his schoolwork.
The class is giving a presentation of the Founding Fathers.
Julian has drawn the part of Benjamin Franklin, a very important role.
Julian has drawn the part of Benjamin Franklin, a very important role. Do what you can to help.
I will turn this all around. That's a promise.
Thank you very much.
Stinky, let's go. You got us in trouble.
Did he call him "Stinky"?
Wow, I didn't know this about George Washington.
Yes, his teeth were made of wool.
Wood.
I sorry. I mix up "D" and "L."
Well, get it right.
Turn that game off, pal.
I got four guys left.
Let's study a little bit.
I don't wanna study.
Give me that.
-You just killed me. -So what? You'll play later.
You can't tell me what to do.
Really? Let's take a vote. Who thinks the kid should study?
Who doesn't? Well, you just lost, two to one.
It's a tie. That guy doesn't count. He can't even read.
I know. He was just joking around.
Can you hang out here a little bit? I gotta go do something.
No problem.
Would you like
We'll hop, hop, hop, hop
What do you say?
Get the door.
Hi, Julian. How you doing?
I'm Scuba Sam. Scuba Steve's father.
You see, my boy... ...needs to take a bath.
The only problem is... ...he's afraid to bathe alone.
So I was wondering... ...if maybe you could keep him company in the tub.
Terrific. And after the bath, you have to try and study hard.
Because if you wanna be a member of the Scuba Squad... ...you have to be smart.
I could be in the Scuba Squad?
Well, sure. All you have to do is work hard.
And don't tell a soul about the Scuba Squad...
...because then everybody will wanna join.
And one more thing... ...be nice to the delivery guy, would you?
It's not his fault he can't read.
Take care.
He told me to watch his boat for him. Said that he wanted to...
...talk to you about some secret mission.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Okay.
How come I have to wear a bathing suit?
I don't know the rules... ...with little kids and grownups and being naked and just sit down.
...with little kids and grownups and being naked and just sit down.
The good news is you're not smelling like a foot anymore.
I read something interesting. You know Benjamin Franklin invented...
I read something interesting. You know Benjamin Franklin invented... ...bifocals? That's pretty cool.
What are they?
I'll show you in that book. It might help you out with your school play.
We'll make this a regular thing. Bathing and studying and eating right.
Put your head back. My grandmother did this to me.
"Oh, boy. When I was a little girl, frankfurters only cost a nickel."
Can you still have fun?
Yeah, but after you study.
In fact, we gotta get you dressing differently. -We'll go to Barney's. -Barney?
Not that Barney. A more expensive Barney.
All right, one at a time.
That's one. Two.
See? Urinals are good too.
"Electricity."
Very good.
"Constitution."
That's it.
"Philadelphia."
Smart. Good.
"Fish"?
"Pony"?
"Hip--" "Hiphop--"
"Hipopynonamous"?
Damn you! You gave him the easy ones!
-Thanks! -You're welcome.
Slow down.
-You owe me a Sausage McMuffin. -Okay.
There's a pole there.
My name is Alexander Hamilton. I was the first Secretary of the Treasury.
I owned a bank and a newspaper. Aaron Bird shot me.
Hi, my name is Benjamin Franklin.
I was a writer, a diplomat... ...an inventor and a statesman...
...although I only went to school for two years.
I wrote many books and invented many things we still use today.
The Declaration of Independence is finished.
Who will be the first to sign? -How about you, John Hancock? -I want to sign!
-How about you, John Hancock? -I want to sign!
-Look at my man stand strong. -He's so cute.
What are your cards?
I got a six, a five, a jack, a four and a eight.
-I win. -What do you mean?
I had a hand just like that. I didn't win.
-Because I win. -This is bullshit!
All right. Take it easy, man.
Every time it's different cards.
So what? Relax. He's a kid.
There should be same set of rules, no matter what age.
He's gotta learn how to lose too.
-Hello, Mr. Koufax. -Mr. Brooks, how you doing?
-Hello, Mr. Koufax. -Mr. Brooks, how you doing? I was gonna give you a buzz.
You just called me Mr. Koufax, didn't you?
It is your name, isn't it? Sonny Koufax?
You held yourself out to be Kevin Gerrity... ...to gain custody of young Julian.
Big problem in this state.
I've delivered to you before. You always order three pieces of cheesecake.
The real Kevin Gerrity asked me to take care of--
Save it, Mr. Koufax.
He has to come with me or I'll arrest you.
Take out your handcuffs.
I don't have any, but two policemen downstairs do.
Listen, Sonny, I would like to help...
...but my status in your country is not what you would call legal.
It's okay.
I'm Audi.
Julian, you're gonna have to come with me.
-Just give me-- -Sonny.
One second, pal.
Would you just give me a second to say goodbye to the kid?
Take a second.
You don't want me here anymore?
No, that's not it, pal. You just gotta go away for a little while.
How long am I going away for?
I don't wanna lie to you.
I don't think we're gonna... ...be seeing each other anymore.
I screwed up, pal. I'm so sorry.
Come here. Put your coat on.
It's not your fault, okay? I'm the idiot.
-I don't wanna go. -I know you don't.
-I don't wanna go. -I know you don't. But you have to, and you're gonna be okay.
Please don't make me go.
I'm sorry, but I don't know what else to do.
I won't play the kangaroo song anymore.
Just go. You gotta go. You gotta go.
I don't wanna go. I promise...
...I'm sorry. I don't even like that song anymore.
I know, pal. That's not it.
But I wipe my own ass! I wipe my own ass!
I know.
-Layla, they took the kid. -Who?
Social Services. I gotta get him back.
You said this was just temporary.
I can't have it be temporary. It's gotta be permanent.
Okay, what can we do?
I filed to get custody based on the child's best interests.
Tommy knew a clerk, so they fast-tracked the hearing. It's Tuesday.
-This Tuesday? -You got work?
I gotta go to Washington for a hearing to dismiss my case.
Can you get somebody else?
I'm sorry, Sonny. I can't. It's my case.
We don't even know where this kid's gonna end up.
Sonny, this is exactly why I didn't wanna get involved.
I had things going the way I wanted.
Then at the park, you and this kid come barging into my life...
...and it's screwing up everything I had planned.
You think I planned on a kid showing up on my doorstep?
But I fell in love with him.
So now my plans have changed.
All rise.
We're here to determine proper custody of Julian McGrath...
...also known as Julian Gerrity, a minor child.
Representing New York City?
Ted Castellucci.
Arthur Brooks, Social Services.
And representing Sonny Koufax?
Phillip D'Amato.
Thomas Grayton.
Plus, I'll pretty much be representing myself.
Anyone else?
Layla Maloney, Your Honor.
-Thank you. -Does this mean that you love me?
Something like that.
First witness.
Koufax is a good egg. He was nice to that kid.
But he fights like a girl. You like that?
I'm right here, miss. What are you gonna do about it?
Are you drunk, Mr. Herlihy?
I had a few chardonnays. What of it?
Get off the stand.
You got it. I've got a few problems.
Off to a good start.
Mr. Koufax is a really cool guy. I wish my dad was as cool as him.
My dad was a military man. Guess I wasn't such a "good soldier."
When I was 35, he attempted to give me a crew cut while I was sleeping.
I broke his arm, haven't seen him since.
I'd rather live on the streets than under his rules.
Anyway, I think Mr. Koufax should be acquitted of all the charges.
If O.J. can get away with murder, why can't Sonny have his kid?
This guy knows what I'm talking about.
No more questions.
No more questions....
How long have you delivered food to Mr. Koufax?
I deliver food for six years.
Plus, I'm stripper. But I've put on weight so it's problem.
I see. And in your experience, was Sonny a good father to Julian?
Oh, yes. They make terrific pair.
They went together like lamb and tuna fish.
Lamb and tuna fish?
Spaghetti and meatball? You more comfortable with that analogy?
Yes, considering we're in America.
If you don't like spaghetti and meatballs, get out.
I'll come give you a crew cut.
Let's see your clippers.
Not my problem your dad was sick.
Stop yelling at me!
Order! Order! Order!
Am I in the right room?
Who the hell are you?
I'm Mr. Koufax's co-counsel.
He has enough co-counsels.
...one more won't hurt.
Let's get on with it.
Mr. Koufax is simply parading his buddies up there.
Can't they find someone who isn't a friend?
What were Julian and Mr. Koufax doing?
Shopping.
Did he appear to be an attentive, loving father?
He certainly did.
And how long have you disliked Mr. Koufax?
Since the day I met him.
For the record, where did you work during medical school?
Hooters.
No further questions.
Asshole.
Next witness.
We'd like to call Julian McGrath.
If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
This is just you and me talking... ...so don't pay attention to these people.
Can you tell me how old you are?
Your Honor, one second.
That's better, huh?
Can you tell me how old you are?
Five.
What's your birthday?
July 15th.
Where were you born?
Toronto.
Toronto? I thought you were from Buffalo.
I moved to Buffalo with my mommy.
For the past six weeks, you've been living with Sonny?
Yes.
-Did you and Sonny have fun? -Yes.
What kind of things would you do?
He taught me how to do the sleeper hold like Chief Jay Strongbow.
That's nice. Anything else?
He taught me how to pee on a building.
Really?
And he taught me that Styx was one of the greatest American rock bands.
They only caught a bad rap... ...because most critics are cynical assholes.
I think we'd all agree with that.
Before you came here, do you remember...
...the last thing your mommy said to you?
That she loved me and I was gonna live with my new daddy.
If your mother could pick anyone to be your new daddy...
...who would she pick?
Sonny.
Thank you, Julian. You can step down now.
That went good, don't you think?
I don't know. Judge doesn't look too happy.
Mr. Koufax, anyone else?
I'd like to call upon myself, Your Honor.
Awesome.
Which of your esteemed co-counsels will examine you?
My father, Lenny Koufax.
What? Forget it, Sonny.
What is going on?
Nobody in this world thinks I shouldn't have a child more than that man.
He also happens to be a well-respected lawyer in Florida.
If I can make a believer out of him, I can make a believer out of everybody.
This court is after the truth, not the opinion of the defendant's father.
You want my opinion? My son is a moron.
I withdraw my objection. Please proceed.
Mr. Koufax.
This is a big mistake.
I only came today to make sure you didn't end up in jail.
That was nice of you. Thank you.
To do what I think is right here.
Cut your fingernails. They're too long.
Okay, Dad.
This case is simple.
It is absurd to think that Sonny Koufax is ready to raise a child.
-Objection! -Shut up, Tommy.
Sorry, Mr. Koufax.
First of all, how did...
...this sweet little boy, Julian, end up under your supervision?
I told Social Services that my name was Kevin Gerrity.
-Of course, you are not Kevin Gerrity. -No.
-So you lied. -Yes.
Like the time I found a bag of pot in your drawer...
...and you said you thought they were pencil shavings.
Yeah.
Remember when I told you Aunt Fay was coming to New York...
...and I wanted you to show her the city?
And you said that you had better things to do.
That's right.
I'm curious. Just what were those better things that you had to do?
Jethro Tull had a reunion concert in New Jersey, so I caught that.
What happened to Aunt Fay that weekend?
She died.
Yes, she did.
Did you happen to make it to her funeral?
-Why not? -I went to Jones Beach...
-Why not? -I went to Jones Beach... ...got drunk and fell asleep.
Hell, yes!
Some role model.
Your Honor...
...my son doesn't have health insurance. He doesn't know how to boil an egg.
He filed for social security at the age of 30.
He is a drain on the economy, on the country... ...and most of all, on me!
Your Honor, to give this young man...
Your Honor, to give this young man... ...custody over another life is not only wrong...
...it's insane.
Hey. I love you.
-What? -Don't be scared. It's all right.
I'm not scared.
If I get custody of Julian, I'll be his father forever.
That scares you because you think there's a good chance I'll fail.
Sonny, it's more than a chance. It's a certainty.
You're wrong, Dad.
You can be scared that I might get pickpocketed in a bad neighborhood...
...or break my legs skiing.
But don't be scared about me being a dad, because I will not fail.
I love this kid too much. I love him as much as you love me, Dad.
I'm gonna give him advice and I'm gonna guide him...
...and I'll be there whenever he needs me.
I'll fly to New York to be at his court case...
...even if I disagree with why he's there.
But, Sonny, you work in a tollbooth.
Don't worry about money.
I am in love with a beautiful girl who makes plenty of it.
She'll be my sugar mama.
I gotta get me one of those.
I know this is the right thing because I would die for this kid...
I know this is the right thing because I would die for this kid... ...just so he won't feel one ounce of sadness.
That's why you're here right now, to protect me, to be scared for me...
...to be a good father.
And that's exactly what I'm gonna be.
Hello, Dad?
Yeah, I just wanted to say I love you.
Hi, Mom? Could you put Dad on the phone for a second?
Can I borrow that when you're done?
Your Honor...
...my son deserves this kid.
I love you too, sir.
Mr. Koufax...
...the fact is you kidnapped this child.
Not only shouldn't you get custody...
...but since you obtained him by defrauding the state...
...you should be in jail.
Bailiff, remand him until I can figure out the punishment.
Bailiff, remand him until I can figure out the punishment. Wait. You can't take him away.
As that boy's father, I refuse to press charges.
Oh, God. Corinne, I'm sorry.
Oh, God. Corinne, I'm sorry. Six years ago, Joe Carter....
Joe Carter?
Toronto and the Phillies. World Series. Mitch Williams-- We flew up for the night.
Mitch Williams-- We flew up for the night. -There was a girl. -Oh, God.
-There was a girl. -Oh, God.
I'm an idiot. I was so hammered.
Chicken wings, Molson 3-0. Canadian beer is like moonshine.
Hell, yes.
You remember? It was at that Toronto Hooters.
That was before he met you. That Hooters thing is a coincidence.
I'm sorry, Corinne.
I know this changes everything, but I had to do the right thing.
Mr. Castellucci.
Pending a blood test, I.... Whatever.
The court grants custody to Kevin Gerrity, pending the DNA test results.
I want you to be my dad, Sonny.
I know. I do too, pal.
But I'm not sure that can happen exactly the way we want it.
Because it seems you already have a daddy.
But I'll tell you what I can do.
I can be your friend, no matter what. All right?
I'll always be your friend.
I'll always be your family. I'll always be around. I promise.
The kid's good at tying his shoes. He's not great at it, so work with him.
He's not great at it, so work with him.
-I'll teach him bunny ears. -What's bunny ears?
Make bunny ears, cross and pull them through.
I go with this loop, swoop and pull thing. He likes that.
-I don't know that. -Go with the loop, swoop and pull.
-I don't know that. -Go with the loop, swoop and pull. I swear to God it's working.
All right.
Go with the bunny ears thing. You're his dad, right? I'm sorry.
It's important, when you eat at my restaurant... ...you never order BLT.
You must trust me. Stay away from BLT, okay?
Hey, guys.
I'm gonna leave you with your dad now, Julian.
He's a good man. I've known him my whole life.
So you two have fun and I'll see you in the morning.
All right?
-Quit scaring the kid for a minute. -Who am I scaring?
Bye, pal.
Hey, Julian. I went to China. Do you know where that is?
It's in Asia, which is... ...by Europe. I brought some cool stuff back.
...by Europe. I brought some cool stuff back.
Did you move the bench?
That's pretty funny.
You know what I got? Some noisemakers. Check this out.
Wanna try one?
That's my foot!
You're nice man. I've got Spice Channel. It's blurry but it's nice.
I've got Spice Channel. It's blurry but it's nice.
Let's make this quick. I gotta get to work.
Holy shit. Sonny Koufax would rather work than eat.
I'm working on a big case. I gotta sue you for making me come here.
Surprise!
Did you just waste the good surprise on me again?
Hi, Corinne.
-Happy birthday. -Thanks, everybody.
Hey, you guys. How are you?
Happy birthday, Daddy.
How you doing, cutie?
Sonny, I beat you so bad in basketball yesterday.
From now on, I have to stop letting you win.
I stopped that months ago. He still wins.
That's because you suck.
Corinne, put a tank top on for old time's sake.
-What is he talking about, Mommy? -Nothing.
-Happy birthday, Sonny. -Thank you.
It's a clock radio.
-Thanks for telling me. -I have to split.
-Thanks for telling me. -I have to split. I got deliveries.
Hang out with us. We'll have fun.
No, I can't stay. I'll hang for a little bit.
There you go. Come on, let's eat, everybody.
Hey, you! Still missing that tooth, huh?
Can we get some fries?
-Vanessa. -Hi, Sonny.
You're a Hooters girl? What happened to Sid's five-year plan?
How you doing?
-Maybe it's a 10-year plan. -Is that the guy with the old balls?
I think it is.
that the Germans dedicated manpower
and trains and trucks and energy
towards the destruction of the Jews to the last day.
Had they stopped six months before the end of the war and dedicated that energy
towards strengthening themselves,
they may have carried on the war a little longer.
But it was more important to them to kill the Jews
than even winning the war.
[Irene Zisblatt] I grew up in a town called Polyana, in the Carpathian mountains.
It was a small town of two main streets.
This leads all the way up to… There is a church over there…
We had a post office and a town hall and a church and a synagogue.
Everybody knew each other.
It was beautiful.
[Renee Firestone] I lived in a town called Uzhhorod.
It was a small town,
yet it had the feel of a big, cosmopolitan town.
Right here was a little deli, right around… right here, and, uh…
My… We used to come here to have our sandwiches for the afternoon.
[Alice Lok Cahana] We lived in a town called Sárvár.
It's in Hungary, close to the, um, Austrian border.
Every day, the peasants would bring their wares from the neighboring villages
in big baskets, and they would carry it on their head or on their shoulders.
Szaszovo was a very small, little community
consisting of 3,000 people.
No electricity, no utilities at all.
So it was… I lead a very simplistic, boring life. Nothing exciting.
But then Budapest, where I ended up, was an entirely different life.
It was an enormous adjustment.
And I looked at this city just going, "Whoa!"
I mean, it was like… I've never believed anything like this exists!
[Tom Lantos] Budapest was a magnificent, world-class city,
on par with Vienna or Paris or London as a great European capital.
This magnificent Parliament building
saw the best and the worst in Hungarian history.
The bulk of the Jews in Budapest
were utterly assimilated, deeply patriotic,
and enormously proud of their Hungarian cultural heritage.
There were about 800 Jewish families  in our town.
And I think the town was 10,000 or 11,000 non-Jews.
I had non-Jewish friends. I dated non-Jewish boys.
My parents had non-Jewish friends.
We also felt quite Hungarian at the same time.
Not just Jewish.
So, Judaism was our religion,
but we were Hungarians.
[reporter 1] On August 2nd, 1934, officers and men swear the oath of allegiance
not to Germany, but to Hitler personally.
[reporter 2] As Hitler's rule over Germany became absolute,
to his alarmed neighbor Austria,
Hitler promised to keep hands off.
[Tom Lantos] In 1938, when I was 10 years old,
I bought my first newspaper.
And I saw the headlines,
"Hitler marches into Austria."
And I sensed that this historic moment
will have a tremendous impact on the lives of Hungarian Jews, my family, and myself.
[reporter 3] Germany invades Poland and Danzig.
Warsaw is bombed, blasted and shelled.
Poland is in ruins.
[Renee Firestone] There were refugees coming to Hungary running away from Poland,
and most of the Jewish families, Friday night the men went to temple
to bring these people home and give them shelter.
They would come and tell stories.
And I remembered very often…
you didn't believe them.
I heard a conversation between my father and another man.
And he was telling my father what the Nazis are doing in Poland.
And one thing that I'll never forget that I heard…
And he said the Nazis are taking our young Jewish infants,
and they're tearing them in half by their legs,
and they're throwing them in the Dniester, a river in the Ukraine.
Then later, of course,
the stories were getting worse,
and we began to hear about mass shootings and mass graves,
But there was a sort of a naive…
I hate to use the word, but I have to use the word…
patriotic feeling that we Hungarians don't do such things.
Hitler was in Germany, so what happened in Germany didn't reflect on us.
I mean, we were far away from it.
[Randolph Braham] There were two wars.
There was a military war,
and hand-in-hand with that war.
There was a second war,
the war of the SS directed against the Jews.
The dark side of the Hungarian national character
was becoming more and more obvious.
The persecution of Jews became more and more obvious.
Jews were losing their jobs, their businesses.
There was a Hungarian Nazi movement, the Arrow Cross,
and this became, of course,
the most hated and the most feared group for Hungarian Jews.
[Renee Firestone] People wonder, "How is it that we didn't do something?"
We didn't run away. We didn't hide.
Well, things didn't happen at once.
Things happened very slowly,
so each time a new law came out, or a restriction,
we said, "Well, just another thing. It'll blow over."
[Tom Lantos] Hitler moved into Hungary on the 19th of March, 1944.
I was 16 years old.
1944, March 19th.
Germans entered, the SS entered, our town.
Two motorcycles was the whole Nazi regime that occupied our town
because they were there with the people that lived there the whole time and did their dirty.
Most of them were people we thought were our friends all these years,
but they turned overnight on us
and went with the other side.
And the next restriction was
that the Jew cannot walk out on the street without the yellow star.
We heard that in Germany they to wear the yellow star
before they were taken away,
and in Poland, they did that.
So at that point we were worried.
[Tom Lantos] I did not wear a yellow star
and I was caught.
I was put into a forced-labor camp
in a place north of Budapest,
which had an important railroad bridge.
And our job was to repair the railroads,
the lines, the bridges, non-stop,
while the British and the Americans were bombing day and night.
We were obviously worried that we would die.
But we were also hoping
that the American and British bombers will hit all of their targets
and destroy this bridge
because that was the way to defeat Hitler.
I escaped from that labor camp,
and I joined the Hungarian underground.
And the next decree would be that we have to pack up 25 kilos.
And at first, we didn't understand. What do you take?
Think about your home, your own home.
What would you take, 25 kilos?
What is 25 kilos?
How much is 25 kilos?
Do you take the pillows? Your covers?
Do you take your dishes? Do you take…
What do you take?
When we were packing,
I wanted to take something that would remind me of the good times.
I was very depressed and worried.
And so I came across a bathing suit.
A bathing suit that my father brought me.
I don't want to do this.
On one of his business trips, about three years earlier,
my father came home.
And, um… he always brought us something,
my sister and myself.
And, uh…
of course, we always asked, "What did you bring?"
And he opened this box,
and out of the box came this most beautiful bathing suit.
It had a shiny satin finish
and a print of multicolored flowers.
And then in the afternoon, when I heard the soldiers' boots coming up the stairs,
I ran back, and I put this bathing suit under my dress.
And that's how I left.
They broke down the front doors. They came in. They gave us a few minutes.
They said a half hour, but it was not a half hour,
to get it all our valuables together,
and they… They marched us out of the house.
I couldn't imagine that they just take out people from their homes…
because they're Jewish.
Our friends, so-called, and neighbors,
they were standing lined up alongside of the road,
and they were yelling,
"It's about time, you go on out of here. And we don't need any Jews in our town."
"We need to get rid of all you Jews."
I stood, and I could not believe my eyes.
[hesitates] The people I went to school with their children. We were friends.
We were sharing things together.
Why are they so hostile? Why do they hate us all of a sudden?
It's like when you read that the Jews went out of Egypt.
We are carrying all our baggage.
The pillows and the covers are tied to them, bundled.
And we children helped to carry. And I'm so ashamed.
[Renee Firestone] We wanted to believe they're gonna take us to Germany. And we're gonna work. We really wanted to believe it.
And we're gonna work. We really wanted to believe it.
And by then, the whole European Jewry was already in camps,
which we didn't know.
The concentration, ghettoization and deportation
took place in a concentrated manner that is within 12 weeks.
And nowhere else was the deportation program carried out
with the barbarity and speed that it was in Hungary.
They say that they will take us to a ghetto,
and we'd never heard that word.
It is not a Hungarian word, "ghetto."
[Renee Firestone] We had no idea where we were.
In the morning, when we woke up,
I realized that we are in a brickyard.
Brick factory yard.
And in April, it was rainy. It was a lot of rain.
And we were always…
We had to change the sheet because the roof was the sheet,
and we were always wet.
There were thousands of people there because they came from the whole county.
And there were guards everywhere, with dogs,
walking around all the time, big German Shepherd dogs,
on very, very tight leashes.
…because this was all these huts, with people, people all over the place.
[Robin] Do you know where your hut was? [Irene Zisblatt] Yes. My hut was right here, where these piles of bricks are.
[Irene Zisblatt] Yes. My hut was right here, where these piles of bricks are.
[sniffles] And then one day they announced
that everybody that wants to go to work to Tokay
on the vineyard to make wine should come here,
and everybody voluntary, gladly went on the train
because this was hell.
And going to work in a vineyard was like going to heaven from this.
We were taken to the railroad station by the Hungarian soldiers.
My mother said to me,
"I rolled up diamonds in your skirt, in the hem of your skirt."
"And if you don't have enough to eat, those are to buy bread."
When we arrived at the railroad station,
we realized that we're not going on passenger trains.
The cattle cars were waiting for us.
[Irene Zisblatt] My father said, "They ran out of other trains because it's wartime."
"They don't have the other train. So, they have to use what they have."
[Alice Lok Cahana] Anybody who didn't go and didn't go fast was beaten.
When they closed the doors, then I heard that knock on the outside
like a bolt closing us in there.
It wasn't normal anymore. It wasn't…
I didn't accept that they were running out of the other trains.
[Bill Basch] In Budapest, this time started getting worse.
I really had to acquire Gentile papers.
I did not exist as a Jew.
I would have been shot. I would have been killed.
You were a hunted animal, 24 hours, every day,
and you didn't know if anybody you encountered
was really on your side.
Had it not been for Wallenberg,
neither I nor the other tens of thousands would have ever survived.
Raoul Wallenberg arrived when all of Hungary,
with the exception of Budapest, was already free of Jews.
He went to Budapest at a time when, in the countryside,
the Jews had already been put into cattle cars
and shipped away from Hungary.
And he decided to join the Swedish embassy there
for the sole purpose of trying to save Jewish lives.
By issuing so-called Swedish protective passports,
he declared that the individual who had this document
at the end of the war planned to go to Sweden.
This was pure fiction, but in the chaos and the confusion of the war,
this miraculous, worthless piece of paper worked.
[Bill Basch] Several of us acted as distributors or runners
to deliver this fake passport
to the people that were waiting in those protected houses.
[Tom Lantos] Wallenberg leased large apartment houses,
put up a Swedish sign indicating that all the residents
were under the protection of the royal Swedish government.
I stayed at St. Stephen Park, number 25.
Most of these houses were upper-middle-class apartment houses,
and a three-bedroom apartment,
that may have had four, five, six people living there before this crisis,
suddenly became a hovel
with 60, 70 people jammed into a three-bedroom apartment.
[girl 1] Very uncomfortable.
It was very uncomfortable, honey,
but more importantly, it was unbelievably dangerous.
The word "protected house" obviously is a misnomer,
uh, because many of the people living in these quote-unquote "protected houses"
were rounded up, taken to the bank of the Danube, and killed.
Now, to get into the protected houses was not difficult.
Soldiers didn't care.
They were out in the front. "Go in there."
However, to come out
that was the very, very difficult thing.
If German soldiers or Hungarian Nazi soldiers were suspicious,
they ordered us to take down our pants
because we were the only people who were circumcised.
One day, I had on my body, strapped around, the fake passports,
which I was delivering to these people so they could get out of the building,
and I miscalculated.
I went through the sewer line, and I knew when to get out.
And I made a mistake,
instead of coming out in the middle of the building,
I came out in front of the building,
where two soldiers were guarding the building.
I started running as fast as I could,
crossing the street back and forth.
And they were deporting a group of Jews,
not knowing where they're taking them,
I jumped into that group of Jews thinking,
"As I got in so many times into trouble, I'll get out one more time."
"Just one more escape."
We would up five days later in Buchenwald.
[Irene Zisblatt] We were on the train for about five days.
Sitting on a heap of luggage that we carried there.
The cattle car that I was in, there was about 120 of us.
Mashed together like sardines, and it's very, very hot.
They had one pail, you know, for going to the bathroom.
And suddenly the buckets filled up, and then the odor was unbearable.
They never opened the doors to go to the bathroom.
They never gave us any water. They never gave us any food.
The children were screaming. They wanted to go home.
"Where are they taking us? Where are they taking us?"
Nobody answered.
It was total darkness.
The light seeped only through the cracks of the cattle car.
[Irene Zisblatt] My father found a crack in the cattle train.
He looked out, and he spoke out loud,
"I don't think we're going to the vineyard
because we just crossed the border, and we're heading towards Poland."
When he said Poland,
I remembered the man telling the story about the children,
what they're doing to the children in Poland.
And I was holding my little brother. He was two-and-a-half years old.
I was holding him so tight.
And I said to him, I said to myself,
"I will never let him go. They will never take him from me."
When they opened the door suddenly…
and suddenly the light hit you.
And because you had your eyes for four, five days shut,
or used to this darkness,
you're almost blinded.
We were so happy because we were going to get air.
We were gonna get off, go to the bathroom like normal people,
and have water and maybe some food.
And everybody would ask, "Where are we? What's the name?"
And it was very strange name.
Auschwitz.
[Alice Lok Cahana] Here, we had to be stopped.
Here was… A lot of selection happened.
-You're all standing in a line-- -Thousands of people,
close to each other,
and confusion and noise.
And then… Don't move, and don't… [snaps fingers]
Like soldiers standing straight, you see?
And in the middle would the SS go here,
to check all of us.
Walking the dogs and just threatening.
-Single file, or people standing next to… -Five.
[Michael] Five in a row.
[Alice Lok Cahana] So it was easy to count, right.
[Renee Firestone] When I jumped off the cattle car,
I knew right away that whatever they promised us,
whatever they told us, were lies.
And you see a lot of people running in striped clothes and shaved heads.
Surrounded by Nazi soldiers and vicious dogs.
And they were yelling, and they were screaming.
"Hurry up! Leave all your luggage there. Just leave everything."
All of a sudden, there was a separation,
and my mother and my…
my mother and… [exhales]
and my brother and my sister…
She held my little brother in her arms, in one arm,
and my four-and-a-half-year-old sister in her hand. I was holding onto her hand.
This is how we were walking towards…
They were pushing us towards that destination.
[in German] When the transports came in,
the people were sorted.
It was a very basic process, a very simple one.
The people had to stand in a long line.
At the front of the line were some medical officers who would say,
"This one’s too old, over 50."
"This one goes to the right. The other goes left."
[Renee Firestone] My mother was selected at the railroad station,
going to the left while my sister and I went to the right.
My mother was taken
straight from the railroad station to the gas chambers.
By the time my sister and I were processed into the camp,
my mother was no longer alive.
[Renee Firestone] We were taken to a dressing room.
We were told we're gonna be taking a shower after this…
after this horrendous journey,
and we are going to refresh ourselves,
and then we will be assigned to our work.
[Irene Zisblatt] They ordered us to take our shoes in one hand and our clothes in the other.
And I remembered the diamonds.
And I grabbed my blue skirt, and in the crowd, you know,
I just fast took out the diamonds and held them in my hands,
and I had no clothes on my body.
And I remember I got undressed with the rest of them,
and there I was in the bathing suit, standing in the bathing suit.
I had a premonition.
I had this feeling that if I take this bathing suit off,
if I leave this bathing suit behind,
all the wonderful memories that were built in this bathing suit…
I kept remembering how I walked around the swimming pool,
and how the boys were whistling at me, and my friends were so jealous.
And now I'm going to take it off, and I'm going to leave it here.
Everything that meant anything in life to me, I'm going to leave behind.
[Irene] They kept on saying
if anybody has any valuables left, to leave them.
They had a section for that. [sniffles]
I held onto the diamonds for dear life because that was to buy bread.
So I put them in my mouth.
And then when I walked up again,
I saw they were opening people's mouths, and they were looking in,
but I was in the… I was, like, at the at the road of no return.
I couldn't give 'em up any more because I would be shot.
Why didn't I leave 'em back there?
And I had them in my mouth,
and I didn't know what to do, so I swallowed them.
We walked into the shower room,
and the dressing room was locked behind us,
and a commando came in and removed all our belongings right away.
They did give us a shower, a little, trinkly shower, and then they…
Again, there was a door on the other side
leading out to the courtyard on the other side of this building.
And at the door, they had a pile of clothes.
And they ordered everybody to pick one piece of clothing.
We waited till about midnight,
then they permitted us to walk into one of these wooden barracks.
[Alice Lok Cahana] A thousand people in a barrack.
If one person turned, everybody had to turn
because we were so close to each other.
I used to wake up so cold,
and I…
used to have returning dreams
that I'm at home,
that I'm very cold,
but my father will come and comfort me, so…
And then, you wake up.
From a whistle.
It's dark outside.
And this is a madman's hell.
[Renee Firestone] We saw this group of about 20 men coming through the camp,
and as they were marching by, I was watching.
Maybe I know somebody.
And suddenly, I recognize my father.
And my first thought was to hide.
It was terribly painful seeing him
with his shaved head and his uniform, like a prisoner.
This man who was helping everybody,
who was the kindest human being.
I just couldn't imagine how would he feel if he saw us
with the shaved heads and in this rag.
So I really just wanted to hide so he can't see me.
And at that moment, our eyes locked.
And I could see his tears rolling down his cheek.
That was the last time I saw my father.
[Irene Zisblatt] I saw trucks coming
and screams in the trucks.
And I saw two children fall out of the truck.
[Irene] And the truck stopped,
[Irene Zisblatt] And the trucks [hesitates]…
And one SS man came out from the front,
and he picked up the children… [sniffs] …like that.
And he banged him against the truck,
and the blood came running down, and threw him into the truck, so…
That's when I stopped talking to God.
They told us that we're gonna get a number.
Prisoner's number.
Well, of course, we expected to get a prisoner's number
on our clothing or somewhere.
And they set up these tables.
And at each table sat a few guards
with huge books open in front of them.
And we presumed that they are going to put our name in it,
and the number that they're going to give us.
And then we realized that they are putting this number
on our flesh,
on our arms.
They took five of us and put drops in our eyes.
We didn't know why. They didn't tell us. And they put us in the dungeon.
They closed us in there,
and we were standing in water up to our ankles, tightly packed,
and it seemed like forever.
It seemed like it was an eternity. They never opened the door.
They never gave us anything to eat or drink.
So, we drank the water we stood in.
We went to the bathroom in the water we stood in.
And then they opened the door, and they took us out.
And they brought us up into the courtyard,
and they examined our eyes.
And some of the people couldn't see for several days after that.
And they took us back to the barrack.
And then we found out later what they were doing.
They were trying to change the color of our eyes.
[in German] For those who wanted to conduct experiments on humans,
this was a useful workplace.
Many experiments were done in Auschwitz to find ways to sterilize women,
specifically Jewish women, in order to diminish the race
without going through too much trouble.
These women were then sent back to the camp.
Sometimes they were immediately transferred
because they were so-called "secret bearers."
They performed tests, then sent them back to Birkenau and gassed them.
One day, a prisoner acquaintance came to me and asked me
if I could try to gain some influence…
if anything could be done, not to send them to the gas chamber.
The only way to do that was to make them undergo more tests.
To save them, we had to keep conducting harmless tests on them.
This is what we planned to do, and somehow it worked.
And that is why I was acquitted…
in Auschwitz.
[Randolph] Having survived the first four and a half years of the war,
the Hungarian Jews were killed in the last chapter
of Hitler's war against the Jews when the leaders of the world
were already fully aware of all the details of Auschwitz.
When we came to Auschwitz,
it was during the Final Solution,
when he just was desperate already.
He was losing the war. Hitler was losing the war,
but he was not going to lose the war against the Jews.
The sadism, the cruelty,
the irrationality of the German and Hungarian Nazis,
of killing the remaining Jewish population when the war was all over,
when they could have gained brownie points
by being more civilized vis-à-vis these people,
was really not present because their hatred was so blind.
[Randolph Braham] The Nazis diverted trains and other transportation means
useful to the Germans
for purposes of deporting Jews,
to complete the Final Solution program.
While I was in Auschwitz,
the transports were coming in two, three transports a day,
with thousands of people in it.
[Randolph Braham] Within less than six weeks,
more than 438,000 Hungarian Jews
were deported to Auschwitz.
The gas chambers, the crematoria, could not cope.
The SS had to dig special pits
to burn the bodies,
using the Jews' own fat as fuel.
I saw how they were throwing people into these fire pits.
And I said to myself, "Something is wrong with me. My mind is going."
I couldn't be seeing this.
[in German] The mass graves were
about eight by ten or ten by ten meters wide.
Wood was piled on the bottom and set on fire.
Then the bodies were thrown over the fire. That was it.
If the fat burned, then the grave was working.
Then more and more bodies were thrown into it.
That simple.
[Alice Lok Cahana] What vast landscape you are seeing here.
How could people, normal people, go back
after working here,
or planned this, okay?
Somebody had to plan it.
Somebody had to be an engineer.
Somebody had to really put on a map, this kind of efficiency.
But the whole time I was in the camp, through the experiment,
every time I was selected, I swallowed the diamonds.
So, every time I swallowed them, I had to find them again.
We were allowed to go to the latrine once a day,
and I never sat on the hole because I had to go and find my diamonds.
And when the SS woman walked by the door, and she saw me in the corner…
I already had the diamonds in hand. Usually I was waiting until…
On the way back, I would rinse them off, like in the mud,
or if there was no mud,
in the soup that we were going to get next,
but I had no time, and I had to swallow them.
My God, this is the latrine.
Oh my God.
At this place, I was with my sister,
with Edith next to me.
And so Edith whispers to me and says,
"It's almost Shabbat. It's Friday. It's almost Shabbat."
How we used to celebrate Shabbat in our house,
with food and with singing and with praying
and, you know, lighting the candle.
And I told her, "Why don't we celebrate inside, in the latrine?"
We ran back to the end, and we started to make our Shabbat ceremony,
and we started to sing.
And as we sang the melody,
other children came around us and started to sing with us.
Somebody was from Holland. Somebody was from Germany.
Somebody was from Hungary, Czechoslovakia. All thrown together.
And suddenly, the Hebrew songs, the prayers, the Shabbat,
united us in the latrine of Auschwitz.
[Irene Zisblatt] People couldn't endure all this pain,
the conditions and the hunger and the lice.
The lice were, like, as big as my pinky nail,
embedded into our bodies.
And we were sore from scratching and infections.
And so, when the electricity went on,
they ran to the barbed wire to commit suicide.
Then they punished us. For every man that ran to the wire,
they took 100 inmates,
and they killed them in front of everybody as an example.
They didn't even let us die when we wanted.
And then I thought of something.
They took away my parents.
They took away my identity.
They took away my siblings.
They took away my possessions.
There is something that they want from me.
And then I thought of my soul.
And I said, "They're not gonna take my soul."
And I decided right then and there,
"I'm going to get up from this mud, and I'm going to fight
because I'm not going to become ashes."
[Renee Firestone] When we arrived to Auschwitz,
thousands and thousands of people were cremated every day.
The Nazis used Jewish inmates,
a special Sonderkommando,
to remove the bodies from the gas chambers
and take the bodies into the crematoria.
As far as I know, there is only four of us
that worked in the Sonderkommando alive today.
And we are the only eyewitness
that saw the whole thing from A to Z.
How the Final Solution was done.
I'm Jewish, from Greece.
And I lived in Greece until the time they took me to concentration camp.
The first week of April 1944,
I arrived in Auschwitz.
They selected some of the Greeks to go to work in crematorium.
Now is my first day there.
I don't know what was going on.
I saw 2,500 people, all naked,
go into the big chamber, which eventually…
They take only 500 people. They were putting in 2,500 people.
So nobody could do anything but stand by their children.
And 15 minutes later, you know, after they close the chambers,
and the SS threw the gas from these four openings,
you know, they open up.
What did I see? I see the people I saw 15 minutes ago.
I see them all dead, standing up, with their children black and blue.
And I said to myself, "What's going on? What's going on here?"
There was a Polish guy that was there before,
and I said, "Where is God?"
He said, "God, God is where you have your strength."
There were four crematoriums, you know, and they were working 24 hours.
And there were a lot of big shots from Berlin
coming and watching how the Jews were dying.
You know, there was a hole, in the, you know, hermetically closed,
and they were looking there how the Jewish people were dying.
Takes two to four minutes. Depends where you are.
A lot of people think that we, working in the Sonderkommando,
we were guilty of something because we were doing such kind of work.
But ourselves, you know, we couldn't get out of it.
If you don't do whatever they ask you to do, they kill you right away.
One time I had two friends of mine, very close friends of mine.
They came in, you know. Their names were the Venezias.
And… [clear throat] …I told them right away
that they were going to die.
And they asked for food, and whatever I had, I gave them to eat,
and I told them exactly where to keep themselves,
where the openings were, so they can die fast.
And after they were through, I took them out, and I washed them,
and I put them in the oven to be burned.
[Tom Lantos] We could hear the artillery moving closer and closer.
And Budapest was the battlefield
between the Germans and the Soviet Army.
And although we knew it would be weeks
before the Soviet Army would hopefully liberate the remaining Jews,
we knew that lots of hardships were still ahead.
[Alice Lok Cahana] In Auschwitz, after Christmas,
we heard more and more the bombing came closer and closer.
The Nazis didn't want anybody to get liberated,
so they were herding the people away from the camp.
[Randolph Braham] The death march was in winter.
Those who could not keep pace were simply shot by the wayside.
If anybody, anybody tries to run away
or do anything that is not permitted, will be shot on the spot.
There were three of us friends that were together up to that point.
But we swore that we would sacrifice each other's life for each other.
We would never let each other down.
Kids. You know, we had this sort of a dream that will be possible.
One of the three had an injury in his knee and had gangrene,
and one of the soldiers noticed him limping.
So, he comes up, and he wants to shoot him.
We step in front of him. He pulls out his Luger and says,
"I'll give you till three seconds. Count to three."
"Either you let him go, or all the three of you die."
Can you imagine, even so young, the decision that we had to make?
Here, we promised that we will die for each other,
but we couldn't keep that promise under threat of death.
We did let him die.
We arrived… About ten days' march or so, we arrived into Dachau.
[Bill Basch] Oh my God.
After 53 years…
it's as if it were yesterday.
You could find them here on the street, just laying,
and you didn't pay attention. You stepped over bodies.
You didn't pay any attention. It didn't mean anything.
-[Martin] Right here? -Yeah.
I never knew anybody's name.
Never wanted to know anybody.
I never wanted to know, just in case someday
someone will know this person
whose shoes I have taken off when he died.
If you can imagine that every morning, my job was for a while…
I had to go barrack to barrack to barrack
and take those bodies and bring them to the crematorium.
We had one of those push cars.
I remember the Sonderkommandos that worked in the crematorium
came out, and they opened the gate.
They took it over from here and walked it in,
but we were never allowed to cross this.
They never talked about the crematorium, but we knew.
If we walked in here, we never got out.
You never got out from here, from this area.
Because, I mean, if they let him out, and he escapes,
they have witness, they have testimony. So they wouldn't let them out.
Look at that.
The inhumanity of man against man…
is beyond belief.
This is…
the most monstrous thing that man devised.
Burning human beings just, just to get rid of them quicker.
Unbelievable.
Just so emotional. It's so hard.
Now, why did I survive?
Why did God spare me?
Somebody started to yell, "Americans! Americans!"
And we didn't know what they mean by Americans. And they were pointing up to the sky.
Planes came out from behind the mountains, from nowhere,
and they just bombed the convoy.
And they they didn't touch us. None of us got hurt.
That's when I found out the first time that the United States was at war.
It was April 29th when I was ordered to go to Dachau.
Actually, the night of the 28th.
And we were ordered to take off as fast as possible to get to Dachau,
not knowing what we were facing.
We thought it was a military camp,
a German military camp that we were going in to take,
and therefore we were gonna capture it and capture the people inside.
We were in the vicinity
of what we found out to be concentration camps.
[Bill Basch] Suddenly, we hear machine guns shooting up.
First thought was that we are being killed.
Then we saw American soldiers climbing, crawling and shooting.
Then we saw German soldiers coming from that direction.
And as they met up here in the center, that Germans gave up.
But visualize 32,000 people coming out of all those barracks.
Outside the camp…
on the railroad tracks was…
40 boxcars, I believe was the count.
Absolutely full of dead bodies.
And not having had any knowledge of what we were facing,
this was…
totally unreal.
Most of them wearing flannel pajamas. That's all what they had.
Blue stripe, white stripe.
Flannel pajamas. People were weak.
Weak probably isn't even the right term.
But they were emaciated.
Some looked very old, but they weren't.
[Katsugo Miho] They were walking dead, is what we called them. Skeletons.
[Paul Parks] A few came out first,
then more came out, and more came out,
and they kept coming toward us
because it was almost as if they realized…
I guess they did. They realized that we were different.
That we were people coming to help them.
And Americans held the gun against the Germans,
but they didn't kill them. They let us have them.
And taking a dozen or so German soldiers that we caught,
literally tore them apart, piece by piece.
We captured a German colonel.
And I went back and told him
that we're going to send you back to the officers to talk to you.
And he spit in my face.
Then I killed him.
It wasn't long before the war was over after that.
But by those last days,
we intended to stop Germany from ever having the opportunity
to stand up again and do this to anybody.
I've seen many a horrible sight
in that two years of… In Italy, France and Germany,
but the worst thing I've ever seen in my life
were the survivors of the Holocaust.
This is something which is…
To this day, I cannot forget.
I wasn't young anymore.
I was very old.
I was 16, but I was very old.
Returning to freedom was very difficult.
We didn't know how we're going to make peace with the outside world,
which didn't want us.
And we didn't know…
who we're going to find or not find.
They didn't know what to do with us. And they put us in a DP camp,
which is a displaced persons camp.
And the closest one from where I was, was in Austria.
And all the survivors that had no other place to go were in that camp.
So it was another camp, but it was free.
After the Soviet Army liberated Budapest,
and I became a free human being again,
I did not know for months
whether my mother or other members of my family would ever return.
[Renee Firestone] I was hoping that going back to Auschwitz is finally going to give me some closure.
And, uh, I was shocked to find out
that it opened up new questions and new doubts.
I would like to find out about my family.
[in Polish] She'd like to look for information about her and her family.
Your name, please?
Renee. R-e-n-e-e.
[Renee Firestone] This is the first time that I decided…
to find some records of my family.
And my sister was Klara.
[translator in Polish] You found something?
Yes, I found something. We can look together.
[in Polish] Please lay the cards down like this.
-Klara. -Klara. My sister.
I found records of my sister, my father, and my own,
and when I asked about my mother…
uh, the archivist, the historian, told me
that those who were taken from the railroad station
and killed immediately,
there is no record of those.
[in Polish] Take this upstairs to the archive and ring the bell, okay?
[in Polish] Thank you.
This is a test of blood or, uh, or something medical.
Subject of Klara Weinfeld.
I found out that my sister was experimented on,
that they were doing some blood tests on her.
And what does this here all mean?
And he said, "I really don't know."
He says, "Nobody ever asked me."
But there is a Dr. Münch, who was the head of this clinic,
who's still alive."
And then I found out that you're going to interview this man,
and that I may have a chance to ask him what those symbols meant.
[in German] My sister Klara died in Auschwitz… Yeah.
And I recently obtained these papers from Auschwitz.
-I would like you to explain these papers. -I will try.
Can you tell me what this is?
[Hans Münch in English] No, nothing important, no.
What kind of experiments were these?
[in German] It's nothing. Everything is good.
-Why did she die? -"Clinical Institute."
-That's my institute. -Yeah.
-[Hans Münch] She did die. -[Renee] Yeah.
When did she arrive? How long did she stay?
[in English] Six months.
-Six months. -Six months? Yeah, six months.
-[in German] And then she died. -Yeah.
Well, that is the normal period. Do you understand?
You were in Auschwitz as well? Well then, you should know.
[Renee Firestone in English] I tried to be civilized,
but he was very evasive,
and I became very angry.
I kept thinking that thousands and thousands of people died in his clinic.
I am going to go back to Crematorium V
because I know that my mother was taken there for sure.
I'm going to light some candles.
And I know that I am not coming back here anymore.
And now…
just very recently,
I got a new letter from Bergen-Belsen
that they don't have Edith Lok. They looked through their books.
But they found an Edith Schwarz.
And I remembered at one point,
my sister Edith decided
that she will use my mother's name, but I forgot it.
And all these years, I looked for Edith Lok.
-Can you find me, though, with Hungarian-- -Hungarian?
Let's just find it. Okay.
-It's not alphabetized. -Yeah?
[Alice Lok Cahana] Going back to Bergen-Belsen,
I want my husband to say a prayer with my children and with me
because we will symbolically bury Edith.
This is the cemetery where all the people were buried
who were brought after liberation to the military blocks.
We found the name of your sister.
She died here.
We think at the 2nd of June, 1945.
So, all the people who died in those days were buried here, one beside the next one.
[Alice Lok Cahana] Today is the most special day of my life.
Finally, the search is over.
And we now know what happened, and when it happened.
I brought here my mother's prayer book,
and here we will say for you
the prayers that's traditional
and light this candle in your memory.
And remember… [clears throat]… you…
forever…
as long as we live.
[Alice Lok Cahana] But there are a lot of people like me out there,
who are still looking.
Because for us…
liberation was not the last day.
[Tom Lantos] I got an announcement that I'd been selected
to receive an academic scholarship
to the University of Washington, in a town called "Seattle,"
because nobody told me it's supposed to be pronounced "Seattle."
I had a ticket on the SS Marine Falcon.
I went to bunk B-20, put down my knapsack, and they called for chow.
I had no idea what chow was. It wasn't part of my English vocabulary.
So, I got into the chow line.
We had these huge metal trays, and this was a period
when, of course, my mental preoccupation was still with hunger.
And these wonderful people slopped on wonderful things on this metal tray.
And at the end of the line,
there was a huge wicker basket of oranges.
A huge wicker basket of bananas.
My mother always taught me to do the right thing. And I didn't know what right was. So there was another huge sailor,
And I didn't know what right was. So there was another huge sailor,
and I asked him, "Sir, do I take a banana?"
"Or do I take an orange?"
And he said, "You eat all the damn bananas and all the damn oranges you want."
And then I knew I was in heaven.
[Irene Zisblatt] I loved my town, and I see it picturesque and happy.
I'm planning to go there for the first time since I left in 1944.
Look at the sign, Robin. It says "Polyana" in Russian.
You see?
The river is running on the right.
We used to go bathing here…
I'm hoping that I can find some of the people that I knew
before the Holocaust…
and maybe that I can talk to them.
-Mushrooms in the jar. See? -Yes.
[Irene in English] Maybe they can tell me things that happened while we were away.
[Irene] This one woman, Mariska, she remembered my grandparents
and my father and my mother and me.
I was most surprised that she remembered me.
I was really afraid that the people were going to be hostile to me,
that they were going to be accusing me of coming back to take something from them.
I was asked in a very nice way,
"Am I planning to take my property and come back to live there?"
And I said no.
I just want my children to know where I come from,
and I wanted to see my town where I grew up once more before I die.
[Renee Firestone] Going back to my hometown
with my family, with my child,
showing her this beautiful town, which…
Everywhere we went, the word "Jew" doesn't exist.
This building was the Jewish community center.
I wanted to go to the Jewish temple, which was a beautiful synagogue.
Look, look, look how they let this…
Oh my God.
What they did to this city, you just have no idea.
It's just unbelievable.
We went to the temple,
and there I met this man, this Jewish man.
He was also in Auschwitz.
[in Hungarian] Hello, do you speak Hungarian?
[Renee] Good morning. Are you from here?
I was born here in 1928.
[Renee] I'm from the Weinfeld family.
Weinfeld?
[Renee] My father had a shop on Cobbler's Lane.
And of course, my mother attended this temple.
I had my Bar Mitzvah here when I turned 13, in 1941.
And why did you stay here?
Because I came back from Auschwitz
on June 6, 1945.
And a few days later, the borders were closed.
[Renee in English] Then he walked us through the temple, and he explained to us
that this is no longer a Jewish temple.
[man in Hungarian] In the old days, there were Stars of David here.
[Renee] What did they do with them?
[man] They made it into a concert hall.
They removed everything.
[Renee Firestone in English] It was very painful to see
that this holy place was transformed into a place of entertainment.
The most difficult part was going back to my house.
Oh my God!
That's the… the original… That's the original gate.
-The entrance. -The entrance, yeah.
It was neglected.
This beautiful house that my father took care of always.
And everything was manicured around it.
-[Bernard] I think that's locked. -[Renee] No.
No, it isn't.
-It just doesn't open. -[Klara] Can we go?
[Renee] It doesn't open.
At that moment, I really wished I wouldn't  have seen it.
One of the neighbors
who was a young child at the time they took us away was still there.
Thank God that you are still alive.
I'm telling you, I can still remember everything as it used to be.
[Renee in English] He has now a Russian wife
who was very sympathetic.
[in Hungarian] Your own house…
To take someone's house, how could that be?
There would be a lot to tell, but you know what they say…
Even the walls have ears.
[Renee in English] She was scared to tell me what really happened after we left.
[in Hungarian] Tell me, after we were taken, did you talk about it?
We were so sorry for Klara. We heard she died on the way.
No. She died there.
Poor thing.
I have only seen it in the movies.
Did they really burn people like that?
Unfortunately, it was much worse than what they show in the movies.
[Renee in English] At that moment, I felt very lucky,
that I would have a chance to go back to the United States, to my home.
I saved the diamonds all the way, through the whole… everything.
And when I was free, I, uh, didn't talk about the Holocaust,
but I took the diamonds, and I mounted them into a teardrop-shaped pendant,
because every time I had to save them, I had to cry so much.
So, I felt that the tears are appropriate for that.
And I told my children that these diamonds should go down
from generation to generation,
to the first-born girl in the family, until forever.
…what it tastes like. [chuckles]
And you can see their different shapes and different cuts.
And they're the only thing that I…
…that I'm holding that my mother ever held.
Okay, well. I don't know what you think about…
My life today is something I myself cannot believe.
Having been elected by my constituents in California of some 600,000 people,
nine times,
it all seems like a dream.
And it all places
an incredible sense of responsibility on me…
As the only survivor of the Holocaust
ever elected to the Congress of the United States,
I know I speak for all of my colleagues,
Republicans and Democrats,
in expressing our outrage at the most recent terrorist attacks…
The central focus of my life, obviously, is human rights
because I am convinced that this is really the path
of a more civilized world.
My wife Annette and I have known each other all our lives.
We grew up as children in Budapest.
And we have been married now for 47 years.
We have two daughters
who early on came to us and said
that, uh… they plan a special gift for their parents.
[Tom] Since our families were wiped out, they will give us a large family.
And we have been blessed with 17 wonderful grandchildren,
and it's really the focus of our life.
[Renee Firestone] I would like to be known as an educator on the Holocaust.
So I go to the Museum of Tolerance,
where I was the founder of the outreach program.
And I speak to groups who come into the Museum.
…came into being.
You know, when these things are happening,
you almost begin to believe that you did something wrong.
Why would they do this to me?
I feel that it is my duty
to make the world aware of what happened during that time.
I always felt that my language is inadequate.
And that if I wanted to tell the story about my experiences,
I have to talk through a medium.
And I found art
because art transcends.
It's beyond words.
I wanted the surface to be very much layered.
It should look like a crumbled wall,
like it's papered over with yesterday's news
because people want to forget the past.
People want to forget about the Holocaust.
What keeps me going is really…
the family…
that my husband and I created.
My grandchildren.
Three wonderful children.
Two of them rabbis.
And my beautiful daughter.
She teaches me every day what is important in life.
And my husband, who is four generations Israeli.
And such a gallant man.
And he helped me to construct a life.
This painting is Arbeit Macht Frei.
When you read this welcome gate,
so to speak, Arbeit macht frei…
My art today is about the Holocaust
because I have no memorial for my people.
I… don't know where they are.
Why so many of my family members died, so many got killed.
The Basch family was almost wiped out.
We have regenerated.
So when we get together, we are quite a large group.
And the joy sitting with my family
and looking around and saying that I was so close to death.
And here I am sitting at a table, and there are 11, 12 of us,
rejoicing life.
The pleasure of living is wonderful.
One day, it was on a Sunday, someone knocked at my door
and walked into…
And I went to the door.
And they had something wrapped up in a newspaper under the arm.
He said, "You Paul Parks?" I said, "Yes."
He said, "We've been looking for you for several years."
"Off-and-on, people have been looking."
"We wanted to find you." I said, "Why?"
He said, "There was a fellow liberated by you guys at Dachau who remembered you."
"And he died several years ago."
"And he'd made a menorah in the camp."
"He made it out of concrete nails
and welded it and braided it together while he was in the camp."
"And he wants you to… He wanted you to have it."
"So we've been looking to give it to you. Here it is."
And he gave me this beautiful menorah.
[Irene Zisblatt] Liberation was like a present from the world.
And that's the first time I acknowledged God again,
that He is around, and He helped me to get to this point.
I don't think that God created the Holocaust.
I think that God gave us a mind and a heart and a free will.
And it is up to man…
what he's going to do with his life.
And I blame man, not God.
I cannot rationally explain…
emotionally explain, intellectually explain the Holocaust.
I cannot… I cannot find…
a place for…
a higher authority
in this nightmare.
What kind of people are we?
What are the books teaching us?
What is the difference between me…
and another child?
What is the Bible teaching me?
What… What is this about?
[Randolph Braham] Hitler remained a pathological anti-Semite to the end.
And one of his last testaments,
or warnings to his followers,
was for them to continue the war against the Jews.
In his will executed April 29, 1945,
he says, "Above all,
I enjoin the government and the people
to uphold the race laws to the limit,
and to resist mercilessly
the poisoner of all nations,
international Jewry."
[Randolph Braham] The Holocaust has to be thought as a chapter
in the long history of man's inhumanity to man.
One cannot ignore
the discrimination
inflicted on many people
because of race, color, or creed.
One cannot ignore slavery.
One cannot ignore the burning of witches.
One cannot ignore the killing of Christians in the Roman period.
The Holocaust perhaps is the culmination
of the kind of horror that can occur
Believe that!
-Ladies, we got picture. -What about the alarm?
Miles, what do you think I'm doing?
Just cool out. We like to run a loose crew around here.
You're the boss, Miles.
It's like that?
It's like that.
I'm gonna go check on Tulley.
Tulley, we cool down there?
Yeah, we're cool, man. Good.
Cool is good.
Are you smoking?
No. Negative. You're lying! I smell the menthol up here, man!
You're lying! I smell the menthol up here, man!
What would your mama do if she knew you were smoking?
Cut it out, man!
Stay alert.
You ready over here?
Damn it! Eddie, why you gotta do that every time?
-It's good luck. -It's bad luck if I land in it. Believe that.
Don't fall in that shit.
See you, Deke.
Good luck, guys.
How's the weather up there?
Snowing.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
You got a guard 20 feet from you.
Ten feet. He's closing in fast.
Around the corner.
He turned around.
Forget it. He's gone.
So much for the easy part. Kit.
-Shit! -Bam!
I hate it when you do that.
Eddie, check this out.
This is a Brigger 3300. Toughest safe in the world.
-What do you do? -Drill the lock.
No, you gotta check to see if it's open.
It's open!
What?
No, I'm messing with you. They would never do that.
They would never do that.
Glasses.
-I'll see you back up top. -Right.
Open sesame.
Come on, Eddie.
-Got the rock? -Miles is right behind me.
Eddie.
What the hell you doing?
Seventeen million four ways?
I'm too greedy for that.
No, just come on, man!
Shit!
Come here, gorgeous.
Got the rock. Time to roll.
Hurry! There's lots...
...of activity here. Let's go!
Shit!
Freeze!
Clear!
Let's go!
-Stay down! Don't move! -Let me see your hands!
Hey, Miles.
-Where's Eddie? -He went over already.
-You have the rock? -What?
You got the rock?
-What you doing? -Give me the rock!
You ain't got to do this!
We're supposed to split this shit, man! Why you doing this?
Shit!
Miles, you're dead, you piece of shit!
Damn!
Good doggie!
Good doggie!
Kibbles 'n Bits! Easy.
Where's the nearest exit?
Stay where you are!
Turn around!
I'm a carpenter! I was working late!
See? That's the saw! See? I was working!
You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you.
If you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
Do you understand your rights?
-Understand your rights? -Yeah, I understand them.
Ain't nothing but a free thing, baby!
Free man. Believe that.
One belt, one shoelace...
...one wallet containing $22.
One shoelace?
You know how much them shoes cost? One shoelace?
I came in here with two.
You took my shoelace? Did you take my shoelace, man?
You got two seconds to walk out that door.
Sign out...
...and leave my pen.
I'm signing out.
I got places to go, people to see.
My lady, Janiece.
Ass....
It's like that.
What you gonna do with one shoelace? Let me in on the secret.
Floss your ass?
Gotta go.
Y'all stay up, man. Don't be mad because I gotta go.
Come on, open this fence. Thanks. I'm out of here.
Where them butt-naked hoes at? Do you know?
Let me up out of here.
I'm free! I'm free at last!
Gotta go! Gotta go, gotta go!
I'm out of here!
Damn!
What happened?
Did you eat the whole time I was in there?
When I left, you was like:
Now, you're like:
Wait a minute. That's all right. I can adjust.
It's the love that counts. I can adjust to a plus-size woman.
Just more cushion for the pushing.
Janiece!
Your sad-ass sack of bones is here.
I apologize. You're her cousin.
Can I buy you some cereal?
It's okay, Shawna.
There you are. Just hot!
Baby, you are....
You look beautiful.
You are beautiful. And that's not two years of prison talking.
Baby, it must've been hard in there for you.
All alone at night in your little cot.
Tell me something, Miles.
Did you think about me?
Think about you all the time.
Think about you right now.
Then you should've thought about that before you robbed people!
I never robbed you!
I'm a rehabilitated man!
Talk to me.
I didn't come see you for two years. Wasn't that a sign?
You couldn't stand to see your man like that.
Man? You're not my man. You lie. You told me you were a banker.
Bank robber. Yeah, see, sometime I stutter.
But I'm getting that whole speech impediment thing--
You are a very smart man, but the time we spent together was one big lie.
Look, Janiece. Listen to me, okay?
I know I lied about some things, but I can change.
I don't think so. -Bye! -Don't do me like this!
-Bye! -Don't do me like this!
Fifth and Grand?
Hi. How you doing? Is this really a police station?
Of course.
Hi. I have a delivery for Traffic.
Oh, yeah. Sign by the X.
What have we got? Egg roll, orange chicken....
Hot pizza coming through. Hot pizza!
Got to get the officers their pizza.
They got to protect and serve. The police got to eat too!
Let the officers eat, please.
I'm the pizza man here to deliver the pizza. Thank you.
Officers, I got your pizzas!
"Third Floor: Robbery-Homicide."
Yeah, please be careful. Pizza's very hot.
Don't want nobody to get hurt. Just got here some pizza for you.
Pizza for you. That's how we do it down at the pizza place.
Watch it, watch it, watch it!
Two time, bring it up! Don't drop the pizza!
Pizza delivery for Robbery-Homicide.
Robbery-Homicide?
Why is it I don't see Robbery-Homicide...
...with a pizza delivery in the log-in sheet?
I'll tell you what. Why don't you leave that pizza with me?
No, I'll tell you what. Last time I left a pizza here...
...it magically disappeared.
I mean, it's just like leaving candy around me.
It's not gonna be all right. I'm gonna...chomp it up. See?
Two kinds of people get through that door:
People wearing handcuffs. People wearing a badge.
You don't have on either.
Well, I don't have a badge or handcuffs, so....
Officer Carlson.
-We wanna flip that card right over. -Sorry. Just got it.
Excuse me, officer.
The guys in Homicide ordered this pizza about an hour ago.
I don't wanna leave them with Shamu over there.
-I'm not sure what you want me to do. -Take them!
-I'm on duty. I can't do that. -Yes, you can!
Please take that!
Thank you very much!
Break it down.
Two time, left!
One time! Break it down to the ground!
Go here!
Left leg! Bring it around!
Walk!
You hid a diamond in the police station?
I didn't know it was a police station. Can you change the ID or not?
Sure, but won't they be suspicious of a pizza man with a security clearance?
I'm not going back as a pizza man.
What are you going as?
-A cop. -A cop?
A new transfer.
That's why I need that ID and a new file for detective.
Why a detective?
That's where the rock is.
It's gonna be expensive.
Uncle Lou, I thought we was like family.
Yeah, well, "like family" is not family.
If you were family, you'd want it for free, right?
Well, you ain't changed. I'll see you later.
Get down!
Put some clothes on! Get your butt-naked ass down!
Get your butt-naked ass down!
He's naked and he's stinking. Somebody get him some clothes.
He's hiding a gun in his ass!
Get on the ground. Do it now. Don't I know you?
Freeze! Cuff him!
Yeah, cuff his ass.
I'm gonna cuff you like that.
I'm the good cop. You act up, I'll turn into the bad one.
Freeze! Get them up!
Spread your legs now.
I'm an officer of the law.
Any sign of Deacon?
Last I heard, he was pulling rip jobs in Carson.
-I warned you about that guy. -That you did.
He'll know you're out.
This is purely cosmetic. It won't check out.
Don't worry. I'll be out of there in an hour, max. Thanks.
Good luck.
Hey there, officer dog.
-I'm a detective. -Sorry, sir.
She's never done that.
Must be the pastrami.
Bitch!
Are you going up?
Yeah, yeah. Up. Third floor.
Appreciate it.
-What? -What?
The vehicle belonged to your friend, but you don't remember his name?
Do you have a last name?
Damn, these cuffs are tight, man!
Miss Green, could you tell this man to loosen these cuffs?
I can't feel my fingers, man. I'm serious. Please?
-I know it. -Detective.
Not so tight.
Maybe I could loosen them up a bit.
-Okay. -Thank you.
You got a great lawyer there. Top of the line. Here you go.
He's in here!
Jesus!
How y'all doing?
Not again, Carlson!
The guy body-slammed me, sir. Maybe he likes you.
He did what to you?
Get him out of here! What were you thinking? Man, that's not smart!
Get him out of here.
What the hell happened up there?
Up here?
I caught him trying to escape.
Who the hell are you?
Malone. Just transferred. Right there.
Yeah, check that out. Bam!
-You know Malone? -No.
Nobody told me about it.
Guys....
-Sorry, ma'am. -Excuse me.
Let me flush, please.
I didn't know. You might not wanna go in there.
You got some paperwork for me, Malone?
We've been requesting a new detective for 8 months.
Suddenly, you just turn up. I'll never understand the system.
Burglary? Sixteen citations, mayor's commendation.
You worked out of West Covina?
Well, that's what it says right there.
You look familiar, Malone. Have we met before?
You wouldn't happen to be in a bowling league, would you?
That's it. You're a bowler.
-I try. -We could use a guy in Burglary.
Right here.
I thought I was gonna be assigned to a desk. Right up in here!
Are you kidding me?
A guy like you? No, you belong on the street.
And also, listen.
Carlson needs a partner with some experience. He just got promoted.
Chief, I just got a call.
Malone's gonna join us. Show him around, and....
Carlson. Let Malone do all the handcuffing, okay?
I appreciate that, yeah.
I'll review these.
All right, well, this is the bullpen here. That's Booking up there.
The holding cells are down that way. You wanna see them?
Seen one, seen them all.
This is my desk here, sir.
Nice desk.
Thanks. Let's see....
Brass is on five.
Robbery-Homicide on three.
Over there, that's the tag and bag.
-Through those doors, that's 10-17. -Roger.
Show him the rest later.
-Come on. -Where?
We got a call. Burglary. It's ours. I'll take this.
-Outside? -That's where all the crime is.
I just got here, and that's not a good thing.
I gotta do work in here so that I know what's going on out there.
I might need backup, right?
How long you been in Burglary?
Me? All my life, man, all my life.
I heard the chief say that you got 16 citations. That's incredible. Sixteen.
That's what happens when your Uncle Lou writes your file.
You can ride up front if you want.
I knew that.
You just gotta be real careful for the pedestrians coming out here.
Walking around out here.
Am I clear to the right? Am I clear? Have I got it?
Yeah, I just made detective.
-No kidding. -Yeah.
I worked Traffic for three years. I got pretty good at it.
You don't have to stop for the yellow. You could just drive right through.
Sir, not if you'd seen some of the accidents I've seen. No thanks.
-Well, there's your green right there. -Oh, yeah.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Yeah, sure.
How many times did you take the test?
-What test? -You know, the test for detective.
That one!
-One time. -Really?
-Aced it. -Really?
Took it out.
Took me five tries.
I did well on the written part, but my performance reviews weren't so hot.
How many times did it take you to get your driver's license, man?
Please! Wake me up when we get there.
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
Goodness, man!
It's a nice suit, sir. It's really cool.
Well, I appreciate it.
Yeah, you know? Appreciate it.
-Got any music? -Oh, yeah. Sure.
I like to jam.
Just so long as we can hear the dispatcher.
That's good.
-I never heard this station before. -Kind of funky. You like that?
Last night these shelves were loaded with Elites. Now they're gone.
Three dozen gorgeous rims.
They didn't take anything else?
They went for my good stuff. Chrome with gold trim. Five grand worth.
What about the alarm?
What about it? It went off.
But it took you guys two hours to get here.
My wheels are probably in Tijuana by now.
Here's where they came in.
Looks like they broke the glass, opened the handle...
...crawled in the window.
Exactly.
Shimmied down the shelf or something.
This is a waste of time.
That's not how they got in.
Of course it is.
Cut it out. That's not how they got in.
This is the spot here.
That's how I would've came in.
If I was a thief.
If I was a thief!
Skylight. Just cut the alarm from the inside.
I could take my time.
Why take your time?
Why would I take my time?
It's heavy.
Now, you tell me.
How long would it take to carry three dozen out and load them in a truck?
-Long time. -It would take a very long time.
But they probably had three or four guys working the damn thing--
Zip! Zip the shit up! Frank, hush.
Because you know better. Come on.
Don't lie to me. I'm the man. I'm the man, Frank.
You're the man.
Your 5000, sorry to tell you, is worth less than two on the street.
Which don't go four ways with much juice once you rent a truck.
And to rent a truck, that requires what?
Credit card...
...driver's license.
Unless, of course...
...you got your own truck.
He's not gonna let us search his truck.
What you mean, "let us"? We the police.
We need a warrant to do that.
We don't even need a key.
Detective, you can't do that. It's unconstitutional.
Look at that. Look at this.
Look. Solved the crime my first day on the job!
-We bad detectives. -There they are!
Filing a false report is a very serious crime.
I'll handle this. Bring your weeble-wobble ass over here.
-You like snacks? -Nothing makes me happier.
You'll be snacking on the bottom of this shoe if this happens again.
Now, you see them ridges?
These ridges will be imprinted on the back of your ass...
...permanently if this happens again.
You understand?
Thoroughly understand you.
Every time you look at your ass there's gonna be a print there.
It's gonna remind you of me and my partner.
-And for you lying. -Right.
Don't wanna see those ridges.
Stop eating cold cuts because it's seeping through your pores.
Will do.
I'll put one ridge on your ass.
Let's roll. That's cool. Let's get out of here.
Detective, I know I'm new at this...
...but I thought we were supposed to arrest the bad guys.
Now he owes us one.
So that's how it works.
We let the little fish go, so that we can catch the big fish later.
-I got it. I got it. -Yeah.
You mind if I drive? I know a shortcut.
You might wanna buckle up.
Are you in a hurry, sir?
No. Just testing your car. Balancing out your shit.
When was the last time you got all up on this thing?
I've never gotten all up on anything, sir.
Yeah, well, sometimes you gotta feed some speed to your ride.
Sir! Watch it!
Hey. This is the police! Move your busted-ass vehicle!
Move, move, move!
This is the L.A.P.D.
We'll pop one in your ass.
We got guns and shit.
I could get used to this!
I like! I like!
Used to what?
Driving. See, my last partner did all the driving.
Who was your partner?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Why?
Hey, look, I'm deep, okay? There's just some places I can't talk about.
We're partners. Gotta communicate. This thing's like a marriage.
No, this is nothing like a marriage.
-What is it like? -It's more like a one-night stand.
Wham, bam, thank you, officer.
-It's like that? -It's like that.
We're just gonna fight crime and zip the rest of that shit up.
-Are you married? -No.
-Girlfriend? -Not anymore.
What happened?
-Work got in the way. -Okay.
See?
Somebody took out a fire hydrant.
-I'll handle this. -I gotta get back. I got a headache.
We're on duty.
But I need an aspirin. A big one, like a hockey puck.
Gentlemen. Excuse me.
Could you come here for a second?
Relax, sir. Just take it easy for a second.
Morning, officer.
Morning. Where's your aspirins?
Back there by the soda machines.
Appreciate it.
I wanna know how the car hit the fire hydrant.
-Open the register! -Don't shoot!
Come on, man!
-Oh, man! -Come on! The safe too!
Come on.
37-King-5. Shots fired. Request help.
418 West Fifth Street.
Detective Malone!
You okay? Oh, shit!
Get back! Back! Get back!
Time out, time out.
All right, I'm leaving.
-I don't want-- -Freeze!
Put your hands on the pavement!
-Hands on the pavement! -There is no pavement!
Put them on the Oodles of Noodles.
-Put them on the noodles. -Chicken or beef?
Chicken.
Cool. Cool is good.
Miles?
Tulley?
-Tulley. -What are you doing?
What am I doing? What are you doing?
I'm freaking working over here. -Detective Malone! -What?
I'm coming in!
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down!
Detective Malone, talk to me!
Go out the back way!
Go! The back way!
Go out the back way!
Detective, talk to me!
Take two steps back!
What the hell? Go!
Hold it!
Hold your fire!
-You okay? -Yeah, yeah.
Listen, it's a dead end!
No shit!
He's behind those dumpsters. He's freaking out. He's got a gun.
Back up!
Get SWAT up here! Sharpshooters can take him off from the roof.
No!
No sharpshooters.
Why the hell not?
What are you doing here, man?
-Who's he talking to? -I don't know.
He high, man. He's hallucinating. Smoking that shit!
He's high.
Put down the gun and come out!
-Hold this. Hold on. I'm going in. -What are you doing?
-Hold this. Hold on. I'm going in. -What are you doing? What are you, crazy?
Miles, what are you doing here?
I just wanna talk to you before somebody gets hurt! -Go away! -Please put down the gun!
-Go away! -Please put down the gun!
-Son, come on. -Shut up!
It hurts my heart...
...to see a kid that has so much potential.
-You're smarter than that. -I'm coming out!
Listen. All right, now, goddamn it! What are you doing?
What are you doing? You got me out here in this shit.
How many times I told you...
...forget the safe? Go straight for the cash drawer. Get in and get out.
He's in the way. Now I can't even get a shot.
I can't either.
Why are you hitting mom-and-pop stores anyway?
Look, you're a driver, man.
You got skills. You can be out there on the road, man, doing your shit.
I'm desperate! I need some money! And why the freak are we whispering?
Back up, nigga! I saw you!
-What are they talking about? -I don't know.
I'm working on something here, and you're blowing it for me, man!
I'm sorry, man. I'm messing up.
-I'm messing up. -It's all right.
Look, I'm not mad at you.
But you're gonna have to give me the gun and let me arrest you.
-No. -Tulley. Come on, man. Listen. I'll give you 10 grand. You know I'm good for it.
Come on, man. Listen. I'll give you 10 grand. You know I'm good for it.
I'm thinking like 50, man.
Tulley, 50? That's pushing it, man! Damn!
Twenty, and you'll spend one night in jail. That's the best I can do.
That's it. Best I can do.
All right, fine. But I'm keeping my gun.
You cannot let me arrest you and keep the gun, man. Come on.
Damn, I just got this, man. This is hard to find.
But you're gonna have to give up the gun. Now, what you wanna do?
You wanna give up the gun or you want about seven bullets in your ass?
Okay, now give me that gun!
No.
Don't just hand it to me.
I gotta take it from you. They're watching.
This is gonna hurt a little.
This is gonna hurt.
Jesus!
That's incredible!
And remember: You don't know me anymore.
I sure don't. You didn't used to be so violent.
So he's like, "Carlson, take my jacket."
He's like, "I got to do this." We're like, "What are you doing?"
He just goes right down the alley, right up to the guy.
Next thing you know, he's taking the guy's gun.
Dropped the guy with a punch. Just leveled him.
I mean, blink and you would've missed it.
Malone, in my office!
Now!
Not you, Carlson.
I've been looking through your record.
How come I never heard of you?
I was undercover. On the down low.
We need a guy to head Burglary. Is that the real reason you're here?
-Yeah, sure. -It's no secret.
Burglary's been a problem since we lost our lead detective last year.
Now, usually we promote from within the ranks...
...but these guys need someone new.
So if you want the job, you got it.
Excuse me?
You're the new lead detective. Burglary division.
Me?
Technically, there's a 30-day period before I can "make it official."
But with your record I don't think there'll be any problem.
Well, say something!
Thank you.
Let's party?
What is this? High school?
Listen up. Now Detective Malone is Burglary's new acting lead detective.
-Get these processed ASAP. -Yes, sir.
Thank you.
I got some things I gotta do. I'll catch up with you later.
I'll take these.
-You know what to do with these? -Sure.
Great, sir. Sorry.
-Captain Penelli? -I'm busy now.
Oh, man!
Shit!
Damn!
-Malone. -What? Yeah.
How do you want me to handle the rotation?
I don't understand. What you mean, "rotation"?
The shifts.
I can't figure out everything on the first day, all right?
I notice you guys had a leak here. What's that about?
One of the hot-water pipes burst, flooded all the vents.
-Vents? -They had to flush out the whole system.
This must be the guy everybody's talking about.
Captain Penelli, Detective Malone.
Malone, Penelli.
I hear great things. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Nice to meet you too there, sir!
Very nice to meet you!
Glad to be here.
Gotta go!
He's a strange one.
Place is closed.
I said we're closed. I should've locked up.
Nice to see you, Lou.
I'm looking for Miles.
Well, I haven't seen him.
I got an important message from his mother.
Well, I still haven't seen him.
Quiet.
Damn, you're good.
You are good.
Good morning. Listen up.
Word is that Jean LaFleur is bringing a shipment of heroin through town.
They want him in San Diego.
San Diego P.D.'s done an excellent job...
...shutting down the harbor and the airports on him.
Detective Malone just transferred. He'll head our Burglary division.
Detective...
...tell us a little about your plans.
Well, I plan to fight crime.
-You know, shit like that. -Great, then.
Does anybody have any questions for Malone?
Yeah, I got a question.
What do you think about the P-31?
P-31.
-What do you think? -It's a piece of shit.
Diaz.
What I mean is, we've all been having problems with the P-31, right?
I'm just wondering what the new lead detective here plans to do about it.
Well, all right. Well, Diaz, is it? Diaz?
What do you think we should do about it, Diaz?
I think we should scrap it.
How many people think we should scrap the P-31?
There it is.
Scrapped. Why? Because you want it scrapped.
It's out of there. P-31, out of there. No more. Gone.
You want 31 flavors?
Baskin-Robbins is where you wanna be. Be cool.
That's my partner.
Detective.
What is it?
I'd like to work with a P-40.
Yeah, the P-40's good.
P-40 it is!
What's he doing? We just got those things.
He's shaking things up. Maybe that's exactly what we need.
-I'm not a cop. -Malone.
This Tulley asshole wants to talk to you.
He's down in Interrogation.
Right away. I'll talk with him.
Interrogation's this way.
Knew that. Is he running his mouth?
Tulley says he has information about another robbery.
But he'll only talk to the officer who arrested him.
I'll talk to him. Alone.
We'll be watching.
What's going on? You said I'd spend one night in jail.
What do you wanna tell me? What is it?
You said I'd only spend one night in jail.
It's only been one night.
Well, where's my 50 grand?
I said 20 grand.
Well, maybe it's 50 now! Because--
Detectives, I've been assigned to Mr. Tulley.
Well, great. That's him.
Oh, my God! What in the world?
-Help me! -What's going on?
-Help! -What is this?
Oh, my God!
Take your hands off my client!
It's no use. He ain't talking!
You have your hand over his mouth!
I think we accomplished enough for one day.
This guy said he has information on another case.
I wanna know, are you jerking our chain or not?
I'm not jerking your chain, fella.
This guy Logan owes me 50 thousand dollars.
If I don't get it soon...
-...I'm talking! -All right.
Who's Logan? And what do you know about him?
All I can tell you, sir, is that he's gay, gay, gay!
I've had enough of this!
You certainly have. Come with me. You'll be hearing from my office!
-He made me bite my tongue. -Come here.
He hit me here.
Next time use a phone book on him.
And they took my shoelace.
Hearing from your office.
Look how she's all over him.
And then he said I was ugly and I couldn't read good.
-Malone. -Hey, man. What's up?
Some guy's been calling for you.
-Who was it? -Said he's your old partner.
He hopes you found what you're looking for.
Your health benefits expire soon.
Whatever the hell that's supposed to mean.
Shit!
Bingo!
What is it with you and the heating ducts, sir?
Cold. You don't feel that?
Very cold.
But I'm busy. What is it you want?
I just tried to pull up your records.
I couldn't find any Malone.
Oh, that's probably because it was spelled....
When I put the name in the list--
The badge number doesn't exist.
Let me talk to you.
-I wanna find out what's going on. -You're gonna find out.
Now, look.
What I'm about to tell you is classified.
You tell anyone, I will bust your ass down to parade detail.
-I've been on that detail. -You have?
-That's permanent horseshit patrol. -Okay, yes, sir.
This place is a cesspool. But listen.
I'm not from West Covina.
I'm from Internal Affairs.
Oh, man!
All right? This place is a cesspool.
-I can't believe I didn't notice. -It is.
I mean, it doesn't seem like a cesspool.
Believe it, man. There's a lot of dirty shit going on here.
That's why they sent me here.
I'm the supercop. They said, "Go, investigate.
Do what you do. Find another supercop.
Y'all supercop up as a team, and crack down the shit.
Crack it down." That's what I'm here to do.
Are we the only guys that know about it? We're in the shit now!
You are a good cop, Carlson.
But damn it, man, you just dug too deep.
What do you want me to do?
Good thing you asked.
Keep your eyes open. Okay? I need you to be here.
And watch my back. Watch my back.
Got it, sir. I'm out of here.
The other way. Go back.
Shit!
Evidence room.
-Shit! -Malone!
There you are. I just got a call.
-There's a 413 in progress at the airport. -Go ahead. I'll catch up.
Bullshit! Someone just stole a museum exhibit from a cargo hold.
That's my problem?
You're lead detective.
Get out there now!
The FBI and Customs Service is already on the case.
-Why are you standing here? -They won't let me in.
Feds are all over it.
That's bullshit!
These boxes contained an entire Egyptian temple.
Excuse me, here. Let me see this. Man!
And who are you?
Malone. L.A.P.D.
Agent Gray. FBI.
We'll let you boys in after we're done.
Look at all this stuff.
Look. They nearly destroyed all this stuff, and they didn't take none of it.
Look, Officer Malone.
Detective.
You know, you're out of your jurisdiction, and you're over your head.
I'm over my head? No, I'm over your head...
...because your head's up your ass.
You're interfering with a federal investigation, officer.
Now, if you and your bunch wanna feel important...
Now, if you and your bunch wanna feel important... ...you can help secure the outer perimeter.
...you can help secure the outer perimeter.
Are we clear?
We clear.
And please...
...tell your men not to touch anything on their way out.
-It's like that? -Yeah, it's like that.
"Head up your ass." That was great.
I couldn't believe you said that.
He called me "officer."
I'm lead detective. I have 16 citations.
You think that comes easy?
Come on. The guy's nothing but an FBI asshole.
He thinks we're good for nothing but sucking down doughnuts.
Let them chase their own goddamn temple.
They weren't looking for no temple. They were looking for drugs. -Drugs? -Yes, drugs.
-Drugs? -Yes, drugs.
It's the oldest trick in the book.
You smuggle it in...
...boost it before it hits customs, right? Make it look like a heist.
That's how all the big boys do it.
All they have to do is look for a truck with a letter B on it.
What do you mean, B?
"Bonded."
Bonded trucks can get into bonded warehouses.
Let me ask you:
How do you know all this stuff?
Did a little work in bonded warehouses.
All right. So what are we waiting for?
Let's do something, all right? Come on. Call in air support.
Dispatch, this is 37-King-5...
...put me through to South Bay air support.
Ten-twelve. I've got a white panel truck...
...B-961, southbound on Wheeler near Manhattan Beach intersection.
Roger. We're close.
Shit!
Now you're in a hurry?
Sometimes you gotta feed a little speed to your ride.
You know what I'm saying?
Here we go.
-Check out the driver. -Yeah.
Five-foot-six, greasy hair, messy, very disheveled and--
Are you a hairdresser or a detective, man?
That's a jailhouse tat.
Driver did a stretch somewhere.
Ten-twelve. Requesting backup.
L.A.P.D., this is Agent Gray. FBI.
Stand down. I repeat: Stand down.
This is bullshit!
Screw them. Come on! Let's do it!
Come on, you!
Come on, get the door.
Come on!
Drop your weapons! Put it down.
All right, don't move! Stand still!
Put it down!
Malone! Take him! He's yours!
Don't you run from me! Don't you run!
Let's see those hands, butterball.
Come here! You wanna make me run?
Come back here!
Come back here!
Bring your ass here!
Come here!
Come here!
It's okay. Don't worry. I'm a cop.
All right?
Damn!
Don't you know better than to run from the police?
-I do. -You got me tired. I don't like tired.
When I get tired, I got ass to whup.
And I think that's what I'm about to do. Get your ass up!
Bingo.
That's the shit.
We showed them, and that's what I wanted to do, you know?
-Put this into evidence. -Exactly.
Evidence. I'll go up with it.
I want you interrogating those men right now.
No. See, I need to go up with this stuff...
...and book it into evidence personally.
Why?
I gotta go through it for clues and shit.
First, interrogate the suspects. Find out where they were going.
When you get them to talk, you can go through all the evidence you want.
But, sir....
If I get the clue, it'd make for a better ass-whupping interrogation.
Let's hear it for Detective Malone!
That's it! I want a lawyer. You cops can't do this.
I got news for you. I ain't a cop.
God, he's good.
I checked. West Covina never heard of him.
-So you know. -Know what?
He's Internal Affairs.
What are you talking about? He's not I.A.
-He's not? -Hell, no. He's FBI.
But he hates the FBI.
That's to throw you off. You think this is an accident?
He knew about the heroin from the start. FBI planted him here.
Thought he'd get first jump on the burglary. Afraid we'd screw it up.
Pencil-dicks.
You don't get that training at the academy.
No, that's old school, man.
You're crushing my head!
That's federal government training.
Like Navy SEAL stuff.
Come on. Let's go give him a hand.
All right! All right! I'll talk! Oh, man!
Look at you.
-It was all worth it for you, baby. -Malone!
What are you doing up there?
I'm just so happy that we're keeping these drugs off the street.
Get over it. They're going right back out again.
-Why? -Because the FBI wants to take it...
...to their lab right away.
-Roll it out. -But--
Malone, come on!
Let's go.
Come on, Malone.
-Detective. -Malone.
That heroin belongs to Jean LaFleur.
We've been after him for 5 years.
He keeps shifting his operations between the U.S. and Mexico.
We're taking it down to our lab right now.
That's not a good idea.
Why not?
Why don't we just keep it here?
LaFleur doesn't know we have it. We could use it for bait.
You mean a sting?
Exactly. A sting!
LaFleur expects these drugs to be in San Diego in three hours.
What kind of sting operation can you get off the ground before then?
The driver told me one of the guys on the truck was new.
You can replace him with somebody else.
Then catch LaFleur when he goes to pick up the drugs. Bam, got him!
Let me get this straight.
You're volunteering to escort these drugs into the hands...
...of the most dangerous dealer in the northern hemisphere?
Hell, no!
What do you need to make it work?
-Me? -You're the man for the job!
FBI will have tactical command, but we'll follow your lead.
It's very brave. Let's go. There's not much time.
Way to go, Malone. Way to go.
-I'm just suggesting some shit. -We need more men like you!
All right. Hurry up. Go. Get out of here!
Wait. Hold up. Wait a minute.
You wanted to go. I'm getting you out of here. Go!
You wouldn't still be here unless that diamond was here.
-I want my cut! -There ain't nothing to cut.
-I want my cut! -There ain't nothing to cut. I'm trying, but I gotta get the diamond first.
Go get it. I'll wait.
I'm trying to. First, I gotta run a sting on a drug dealer.
You're a goddamn liar!
Would I make this shit up? Get out of here!
-I'll see you at Lou's tomorrow. -I wanna talk about this!
I don't know what you're doing...
...but it ain't gonna work!
And let me get my gun back!
Look. Maybe this isn't a good idea, you know?
-This is a great idea. It'll work. -Brilliant.
-LaFleur's looking for this. -We know what we're doing, detective.
-Oh, I'm a detective now. -Detective.
Give us a level, please.
All right, detective.
The objective is to have these men see you as if you were one of them:
A member of the criminal underworld. It's important your actions, speech...
...and general behavior are congruent with their expectation of a criminal.
I get it. Sort of "walk the walk." That's right.
You have to look, act...
...and even think like a criminal.
Change your speech patterns too.
Criminals like to use slang terminology, profanity and so forth...
...especially with regard to police and authority figures.
You mean like, "Shut the hell up, you dickless FBI--"
-That's right. -"You stupid ass."
-That'll do. -"You tight--"
Enough!
All right, listen up.
LaFleur's a killer.
If he senses anything amiss, Malone is gonna be in one hell of a tight spot.
If anything happens to me, forget everything I ever told you.
You mean about Internal Affairs?
No, Carlson. I mean about everything.
-Detective, saddle up. -Okay?
Good luck.
Carlson, remember. Forget it!
Time to go.
Detective.
If my client gets a scratch on him while he's in your custody...
...I'll see your badge is revoked and you're thrown in jail. Okay?
You can't touch me.
He'll be fine, counselor. Malone, let's get this show on the road.
Drive. Buckle up.
-Give me video. -Let's get one thing straight.
This is my side here and that's your side there.
Stay on your side and I'm gonna stay on mine.
Gentlemen. Keep the chatter to a minimum.
You don't like the show, change the channel.
And keep this channel clear.
Who is this guy?
That's Malone.
I can't drive if you do that.
Drive!
We're coming up on our exit.
All units, this is Gray. Fall back and keep your distance.
We're approaching the site.
L.A.P.D., take the south side. We'll take the north.
They're headed into Warehouse 3.
Focus in. Closer.
This is it.
-You sure? -Yeah. Warehouse 3.
All right, Benny, sit tight and keep your mouth shut.
Thanks for the tip.
What's Malone doing?
They're coming in behind you.
Get ready. Here he comes.
That's what I'm talking about!
-That's the shit. -You're right!
All 500 kilos!
What are you talking about? Let's get out! I want my cut!
-You still got it? -We still have a signal.
It's just distorted.
Can you hear him?
We can't get out of here, okay? They got cops everywhere.
-So? You're one of them. -No, no, no.
I'm a drug dealer now.
Man, listen to me. You're a jewel thief.
I'm a drug dealer now!
Why you selling this when you got that diamond?
Just like old times.
I don't believe that shit!
Is this a reunion?
Look what we got here. Give it up.
Isn't that beautiful? Say bye.
Welcome to the party. Son of a bitch!
We've lost him.
I'll enjoy doing you more than I did Eddie.
-Deacon, man-- -Shut up!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Know anything about this? -I don't know shit!
I'm gonna throw up.
What the hell? All units, stand by.
-What's going on? -I don't know!
I never know what's going on!
Take it down! Here. Bring it in.
-Out of the truck. Out of the truck! -You guys. Come on. Get out.
Benny, what's going on?
It took longer than I thought.
-What happened to your face? -Nothing. Not a big deal.
Who hired these two guys?
I did. You told me to get guys.
You didn't introduce me. How you doing?
Pete. Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.
And who might you be?
Don't mess with him. That's a stone-cold killer.
You don't want to mess with him. He's stone-cold.
That boy is bad. I seen him rip somebody's guts through their ass...
...and their eyes fell out.
Do the move you do!
The gut-and-eyes move.
That's where they went splat. Just dropped them.
I'm bad.
I'll rip your lips off and kiss my ass with them shits.
I seen him do it.
I do that. That's how I get down.
I'll rip your tongue out and lick my balls with them.
Shut up.
Check him out.
Francois, you search him.
-We're moving in. -No, wait.
This must be a part of his plan.
What plan? He's unarmed and outnumbered.
Trust me. You should see Malone's résumé.
This is like a walk in the park for him.
I must tell you, Pete.
You look the part...
...you certainly talk the talk...
...but you still stink like a cop.
Damn it! I knew he would catch us, man.
Shut up! That's bullshit.
Come on, man. Just talk to him. We might get out of here!
See? He's lying!
If I was a cop, would I have busted his shit? That's bleeding!
Lock him in the car.
Get him out of here.
If I was a cop-- Shut up!
My nose bleeding!
Damn!
You better tell us the truth.
He's a cop.
He hijacked the truck. This is a setup.
If I was a cop, FBIs would be in here right now, man...
...taking everybody to jail!
I think... ...I have an idea.
You wanna prove you aren't a cop?
You say he's lying.
Damn right.
Shoot him.
Shoot him.
No problem.
-You son of a bitch! -I meant, kill him.
You didn't say that. You just said, "Shoot him."
You wanna prove you aren't a cop?
Kill him.
There ain't no coming back for him.
That's it. We're moving in. All units, move in.
Let's go!
Shit!
Give me the diamond or I'll pop one in your ass!
You had your chance.
Freeze! L.A.P.D.!
Show me your hands!
Nice shot.
Get out of the car! Turn around!
Shit!
All units, this is Agent Gray, FBI.
We have no authority to pursue the suspect beyond our border.
Do not cross into Mexico!
Pursuit heading southbound. We have an undercover officer onboard.
I repeat: We have a friendly onboard. Over!
Roger that!
Hold on!
Shit!
Look out!
Get him! I'm glad to see y'all!
What you waiting for? Go!
We can't, Malone. We have no jurisdiction.
Damn that! Damn the jurisdiction! Go! Now!
We cannot cross into Mexico.
-You can't? You can't? -No. No!
-Watch me. -Malone. Malone!
Believe that!
-Malone! -Move your ass!
Damn it! One bullet.
Come on, Miles!
Shit!
-You're under arrest. -What are you doing?
-I'm arresting you before they get here. -Oh, yeah?
Maybe I'll blow your head off before they get here.
No, no. The way I see it is you got 30 seconds...
...before they make a piñata out of you.
What are they talking about?
Malone is an expert negotiator.
He's an expert, sir.
You got two choices.
You can wind up somebody's bitch...
...or somebody's señorita.
Make up your mind. Your choice.
I got three choices. Maybe I just tell them who you are.
You'll shut your mouth. Maybe I'll cut you in on the diamond.
Shithead, I got the goddamn diamond.
Let me get that. I'm your only way out!
Now, give me the gun.
You don't wanna go to jail in Mexico.
Nobody wanna go to jail in Mexico. They put burritos in your ass.
Shut up!
Come on, Deke. Give me the gun. Come on!
They think I'm a cop! They think I'm a cop, man!
I can help you, okay?
You don't wanna die here. Now give that up.
If you screw me, I swear to God, I'll come back for you.
I'll come back for you!
Give me the gun!
There you go. Let me get that from you.
Come on. Let it go.
There you go.
This is gonna hurt a bit.
Holy Christ!
That's for Eddie.
You son of a bitch!
Come back here!
You son of a bitch!
Miles, you die!
-You all right? -Yeah.
I needed a vacation anyway, right?
The FBI needs to talk to you, Detective Malone.
Peterson, regional director, FBI. We need to talk.
Wait a minute. Slow down.
No, lieutenant, I will not slow down.
Is this man one of yours...
...or not?
You bet your ass he is.
Well, I'm gonna find out what happened here...
...even if it means putting your entire department under federal review.
Nice work.
My office spent an hour talking to West Covina... ...and the U.S. Attorney's Office...
...and the U.S. Attorney's Office...
...trying to find out just who it is you're working for.
Now we know it's not the Bureau.
It's time that you gave us an explanation.
-I'm a federale. -A federale?
Look across that border. What do you see?
That is the Democratic Republic of Mexico.
-You're Mexican? -That's right.
On my mother's father's side.
I can see it.
Glacias, thank you.
Gentlemen, I shouldn't be telling y'all this.
I could lose my federale-hood.
-Your what? -My federale-hood!
Look, I had to throw you guys off, okay?
I was doing it for my country.
The red...
...the white...
...and the green.
If you'll excuse me, I have to cross this border...
...and school some of my compadres, you know...
...on things we like to talk about. So y'all stay up. Be cool.
What's happening? Hook a brother up with a taco!
A burrito!
I can't believe so much bad shit can happen on such a beautiful day.
Malone!
Yeah, what?
I think your Spanish is a little rusty.
You just told those men you got a big cat in your pants.
That's a Latin thing. Macho. You wouldn't understand.
No, I think I do understand...
...Logan.
What?
How'd you know it was me?
I started thinking if I was Miles Logan...
...and had my diamond hidden in a police building, what would I do?
So I thought like a crook.
Is that right?
I don't believe this.
He's a major felon.
This is one hell of a bust, Carlson.
Yeah. It's a hell of a bust for us.
It's just too bad we can't make it.
-Say what? -Well....
You heard the FBI. They're extremely strict...
...about pursuing suspects across international borders.
And you're just out of our jurisdiction.
You're...?
Exactly, because I'm across the--
If I'm across the border and you're over there, there's no way you--
I love this jurisdiction shit!
I guess this is the last time I'm gonna see you boys.
Yeah. But maybe we'll catch you later.
-Is it like that? -Yeah. It's like that.
Right there. Jurisdiction.
Three minutes.
This is it. Ground zero.
Want to say a few words for the occasion?
With a gun barrel between your teeth, you speak only in vowels.
I can't think of anything.
For a second, I forget about Tyler's controlled demolition thing
and I wonder how clean that gun is.
It's getting exciting now.
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love -
well, it works both ways.
We have front-row seats for this theater of mass destruction.
The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem
wrapped the foundation columns of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.
In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges
and a few square blocks will be reduced to smoldering rubble.
I know this because Tyler knows this.
Two and a half. Think of everything we've accomplished.
Suddenly I realize that all of this - the gun, the bombs, the revolution -
has got something to do with a girl named Marla Singer.
Bob. Bob had bitch tits.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.
The big moosie slobbering all over me, that was Bob.
We're still men.
Yes, we're men.
Men is what we are.
Bob had had his testicles removed. Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch tits cos his testosterone was too high
and his body upped the estrogen.
- That was where I fit. - They'll have to drain my pecs again.
Between those huge, sweating tits
that hung enormous, the way you'd think of God's as big.
OK, you cry now.
No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.
For six months, I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't sleep...
With insomnia, nothing's real.
Everything's far away.
Everything's a copy of a copy
of a copy.
When deep-space exploration ramps up, it'll be corporations that name everything.
The IBM Stellar Sphere.
The Microsoft Galaxy.
The Planet Starbucks.
I need you out of town this week to cover some red flags.
It must have been Tuesday. He had on his cornflower-blue tie.
You want me to deprioritize my reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons. Call me if there's any snags.
He was full of pep. Must have had his grande latte enema.
Like so many others, I had become a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.
- I'd like Erika Pekkari dust ruffles. - Please hold.
If I saw something clever, a coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang, I had to have it.
The Klipsk personal office unit.
The Hovetrekke home exerbike.
Or the Ohamshab sofa with the Strinne green stripe pattern.
Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of environmentally friendly paper.
I'd flip through catalogs and wonder: "What kind of dining set defines me?"
I had it all. Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
proof they were crafted by the honest, hard-working, indigenous peoples of...
- Please hold. - ..wherever.
We used to read pornography.
Now it was the Horchow collection.
- No. You can't die from insomnia. - What about narcolepsy?
I nod off, I wake up in strange places. I have no idea how I got there.
- You need to lighten up. - Can you please give me something?
Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.
Chew some valerian root and get more exercise.
- Hey, come on. I'm in pain. - You wanna see pain?
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesdays. See the guys with testicular cancer.
That's pain.
I always wanted three kids. Two boys and a girl.
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.
We never could agree on anything.
Well, she had her first child last week.
A girl.
With her... with her new husband.
And thank God. You know?
I-I'm glad for her.
Because she deserves it.
Everyone, let's thank Thomas for sharing himself with us.
Thank you, Thomas.
I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage.
And that gives me strength.
We give each other strength.
It's time for the one-on-ones.
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example and really open ourselves up.
Could you find a partner?
And this is how I met the big moosie.
His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.
Knees together. Those awkward little steps.
- My name is Bob. - Bob?
Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.
You know that chest expansion program on late-night TV?
That was his idea.
I was a juicer.
You know - using steroids.
Diabonal and... Wisterol.
Oh, they use that on racehorses, for Chrissakes.
And now I'm bankrupt, I'm divorced,
my two grown kids won't even return my phone calls.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big, rubbery one.
Go ahead... Cornelius.
You can cry.
And then... something happened. I let go.
That's really good.
Lost in oblivion.
Dark and silent and complete.
I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.
It's OK.
Babies don't sleep this well.
I became addicted.
If I didn't say anything, people always assumed the worst.
They cried harder... then I cried harder.
Now we're going to open the green door, the heart chakra...
I wasn't really dying.
I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.
I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
Imagine your pain as a white ball of healing light.
It moves over your body, healing you.
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe.
And step forward through the back door of the room.
Where does it lead?
To your cave.
Step forward into your cave.
That's right.
You're going deeper into your cave,
and you're going to find your power animal.
Slide.
Every evening I died.
And every evening I was born again.
Resurrected.
Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too.
Being there, pressed against his tits, ready to cry.
This was my vacation.
And she... ruined everything.
This is cancer, right?
This chick, Marla Singer, did not have testicular cancer.
She was a liar.
She had no diseases at all.
I had seen her at Free And Clear, my blood parasites group, Thursdays.
Then at Hope, my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.
And again at Seize The Day, my tuberculosis, Friday night.
Marla, the big tourist.
Her lie reflected my lie.
And suddenly, I felt nothing.
I couldn't cry. So once again, I couldn't sleep.
Next group, after guided meditation,
after we open our heart chakras, when it's time to hug,
I'll grab that bitch Marla Singer and scream:
Marla, you liar! You big tourist! I need this! Now, get out!
I hadn't slept in four days.
We'll just let that dry...
When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep
and you're never really awake.
To begin tonight's communion, Chloe would like to say a few words.
Oh, yeah. Chloe.
Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton would look
if you made it walk around a party being extra nice to everybody.
Well, I'm still here.
But I don't know for how long.
That's as much certainty as anyone can give me.
But I've got some good news.
I no longer have any fear of death.
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
No one will have sex with me.
I'm so close to the end, and all I want is to get laid for the last time.
I have pornographic movies in my apartment,
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite. - Thank you, Chloe.
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.
Thank you, Chloe.
Now, let's ready ourself for guided meditation.
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.
You step inside your cave and you walk...
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.
Marla.
The scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would heal if you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
..deeper into your cave as you walk.
You feel a healing energy all around you.
Now find your power animal.
Slide.
OK. Let's partner up.
Pick someone special to you tonight.
Hey.
- We need to talk. - Sure.
- I'm onto you. - What?
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.
Sorry?
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia Plath sense, I know we're all dying.
But you're not dying the way Chloe back there is dying.
So?
So you're a tourist.
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma, I saw you at tuberculosis.
I saw you at testicular cancer!
I saw you practicing this.
- Practicing what? - Telling me off.
Is it going as well as you hoped... "Rupert"?
- I'll expose you. - Go ahead. I'll expose you.
Come together. Let yourselves cry.
- Oh, God. Why are you doing this? - Cheaper than a movie and coffee's free.
Look, this is important. These are my groups. I've been coming for over a year.
- Why do you do it? - I don't know.
When people think you're dying, they really listen to you instead of...
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.
Yeah. Yeah.
Share yourself, completely.
You don't want to get into this. It becomes an addiction.
- Really? - I'm not kidding.
I can't cry if another faker is present, and I need this.
So you gotta find somewhere else to go.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem.
Wait a second. Hold on. We'll split up the week, OK? You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
We'll split up the week, OK? You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over at all.
Good. Fine. Testicular cancer should be no contest.
Technically, I have more right to be there. You still have your balls.
- You're kidding. - I dunno. Am I?
No. No.
- What do you want? - I'll take the parasites.
You can't have both. Take the blood parasites.
- I want brain parasites. - I'll take blood, I want brain dementia.
- I want that. - You can't have the whole brain.
So far, you have four. I only have two.
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.
Now we both have three...
Hey! You left half your clothes.
- What, are you selling those? - Yes, I'm selling some clothes.
We each have three. That's six. What about the seventh day? I want bowel cancer.
The girl had done her homework.
- No. No. I want bowel cancer. - That's your favorite too?
- Tried to slip it by me, eh? - Look, we'll split it.
Take the first and third Sunday of the month.
Deal.
- Looks like this is goodbye. - Let's not make a big thing out of it.
How's this for not making a big thing?
Hey, Marla! Marla!
- Maybe we should exchange numbers. - Should we?
We might wanna switch nights.
OK.
This is how I met Marla Singer.
Marla's philosophy of life was that she might die at any moment.
The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.
It doesn't have your name! Who are you?
Cornelius? Rupert? Travis? Any of the stupid names you give each night?
You wake up at SeaTac.
SFO. LAX.
You wake up at O'Hare. Dallas Fort Worth. BWI.
Pacific. Mountain. Central. Lose an hour. Gain an hour.
Check-in for that flight isn't for another two hours.
This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.
You wake up at Air Harbor International.
If you wake up at a different time, in a different place,
could you wake up as a different person?
Everywhere I travel, tiny life.
Single-serving sugar, single-serving cream, single pat of butter.
The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.
Shampoo-conditioner combos. Sample package mouthwash. Tiny bars of soap.
The people I meet on each flight, they're single-serving friends.
Between takeoff and landing, we have our time together, but that's all we get.
Welcome!
On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
I was a recall coordinator. My job was to apply the formula.
The infant went through the windshield. Three points.
A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.
The rear differential locks up.
The teenager's braces are stuck to the ashtray. Make a good anti-smoking ad.
The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.
Now, should we initiate a recall?
Father must've been huge. See where the fat burned to the seat? Polyester shirt?
Very modern art.
Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.
Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.
Multiply the result by the average out-of-court settlement, C.
A x B x C...
equals X.
If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one.
- Are there a lot of these accidents? - You wouldn't believe.
Which car company do you work for?
A major one.
Every time the plane banked too sharply on takeoff or landing,
I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.
Anything.
Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.
"If you are seated in an emergency exit row
and feel unable or unwilling to perform the duties listed on the safety card,
please ask a flight attendant to reseat you."
- It's a lot of responsibility. - Wanna switch seats?
No. I'm not sure I'm the man for that particular job.
An exit-door procedure at 30,000 feet. Mm-hm.
The illusion of safety.
Yeah. I guess so.
You know why they put oxygen masks on planes?
- So you can breathe. - Oxygen gets you high.
In a catastrophic emergency, you take giant panic breaths.
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile. You accept your fate.
It's all right here.
Emergency water landing, 600mph.
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.
That's, um...
That's an interesting theory.
- What do you do? - What do you mean?
- What do you do for a living? - So you can pretend you're interested?
OK.
You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
We have the exact same briefcase.
Soap.
- Sorry? - I make and I sell soap.
The yardstick of civilization.
And this is how I met...
"Tyler Durden."
You know if you mix gasoline and frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?
- No, I did not. Is that true? - That's right.
One can make all kinds of explosives using simple household items.
- Really? - If one were so inclined.
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting single-serving friend I've ever met.
- Everything on a plane's single-serving. - Oh, I get it. Very clever.
Thank you.
How's that working out for you?
- What? - Being clever.
- Great. - Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.
Now, a question of etiquette. As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?
How I came to live with Tyler is...
Airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage.
Was it ticking?
Throwers don't worry. Modern bombs don't tick.
- Sorry. Throwers? - Baggage handlers.
But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Nine times out of ten it's an electric razor, but... every once in a while...
it's a dildo.
It's company policy never to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.
We have to use the indefinite article - "a dildo", never "your dildo".
I don't own...
I had everything in that suitcase. My CK shirts. My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.
Never mind.
Hey! That's my car!
Home was on the 15th floor of a filing cabinet for widows, young professionals.
The walls were solid concrete.
A foot of concrete's important when your next-door neighbor
has to watch game shows at full volume.
Or when a blast of debris that used to be your personal effects
blows out of your windows and sails flaming into the night.
I suppose these things happen.
There's... nothing up there.
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.
Do you have somebody you can call?
How embarrassing. A houseful of condiments and no food.
Police later told me the pilot light might have gone out, letting out a bit of gas.
That could have slowly filled the condo - 1700 square feet with high ceilings -
for days and days.
Then the refrigerator's compressor could have clicked on.
Yeah?
I can hear you breathing, you...
If you ask me now, I couldn't tell you why I called him.
- Hello? - Who's this?
- Tyler? - Who is this?
Um... We met... we met on the airplane.
We had the same suitcase?
- Uh... the clever guy. - Oh, yeah. Right.
I called a second ago. There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.
Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone.
- So what's up? - Uh...
Well...
You're not gonna believe this.
It could be worse.
A woman could cut off your penis while you sleep and toss it out of a car.
There's always that.
It's just, when you buy furniture, you tell yourself:
"That's the last sofa I'll need. Whatever happens, I got that sofa problem handled."
I had it all. I had a stereo that was very decent.
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.
I was close to being complete.
- Shit, man. And now it's all gone. - All gone.
All gone.
Do you know what a duvet is?
- A comforter. - It's a blanket. Just a blanket.
Why do guys like us know what a duvet is?
Is this essential to our survival in the hunter-gatherer sense?
No.
- What are we, then? - I dunno. Consumers.
Right. We're consumers.
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.
Murder, crime, poverty. These things don't concern me.
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,
television with 500 channels,
some guy's name on my underwear.
Rogaine. Viagra. Olestra.
- Martha Stewart. - Fuck Martha Stewart.
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic. It's all going down.
So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns.
I say never be complete.
I say stop being perfect.
I say let's evolve.
Let the chips fall where they may.
But that's me, and I could be wrong. Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
It's just stuff. It's not a tragedy. You did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living.
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living.
Fuck, you're right. No, I don't smoke.
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...
- What? - Things you own end up owning you.
But do what you like, man.
Oh, it's late.
- Hey, thanks for the beer. - Yeah, man.
I should find a hotel.
- Oh! - What?
What?
- A hotel? - Yeah.
- Just ask, man. - What are you talking about?
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer and you still can't ask.
- What? - You called cos you need a place to stay.
- Oh, hey. No, no, no. - Yes, you did. So just ask.
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.
Would... would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
- Can I stay at your place? - Yeah.
Thanks.
- I want you to do me a favor. - Yeah, sure.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
- What? - I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Let me tell you a little about Tyler Durden.
Tyler was a night person. While the rest of us slept, he worked.
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel. It comes on a few.
So someone has to switch the projectors at the exact moment
that one reel ends and the next one begins.
If you look, you can see little dots come into the upper right corner of the screen.
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.
That's the cue for a changeover.
He flips the projectors, movie keeps going and the audience has no idea.
- Why would anyone want this shit job? - It affords him interesting opportunities.
Like splicing a frame of pornography into family films.
When the snooty cat and the courageous dog with the celebrity voices first meet,
you'll catch a flash of Tyler's contribution to the film.
- Nobody knows they saw it, they did. - A nice big cock.
Even a hummingbird couldn't catch Tyler at work.
Tyler also worked sometimes as a banquet waiter at the Pressman Hotel.
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.
Apart from seasoning lobster bisque, he farted on meringues, sneezed on endives...
As for the cream of mushroom soup...
- Go ahead, tell 'em. - You get the idea.
- You just want me to hit you? - Come on. Do me this one favor.
- Why? - Don't know. Never been in a fight. You?
- No. But that's a good thing. - You can't know yourself if you haven't.
I don't wanna die without any scars.
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve. - Oh, God. This is crazy.
So go crazy! Let it rip.
- I don't know about this. - I don't either.
Who gives a shit? No one's watching. What do you care?
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?
That's right.
- Where? Like, in the face? - Surprise me.
This is so fucking stupid.
Motherfucker! You hit me in the ear!
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry. - Ow! Christ!
Why the ear, man?
- I fucked it up. - No, that was perfect. Ugh! Agh!
No, it's all right.
It really hurts.
Right.
- Hit me again. - No, you hit me. Come on!
We should do this again sometime.
- Where's your car? - What car?
I don't know how Tyler found that house, but he said he'd been there for a year.
It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.
Most of the windows were boarded up.
There was no lock on the front door from when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.
The stairs were ready to collapse.
I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting. Neither would've surprised me.
Yep. That's you.
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?
Yeah, thanks.
What a shithole.
Nothing worked.
Turning on one light meant another light in the house went out.
There were no neighbors. Just warehouses and a paper mill.
That fart smell of steam. The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.
Hey. What have we here?
- Hey, guys. - Hey.
Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.
By the end of the first month, I didn't miss TV.
I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.
Can I be next?
All right, man.
Lose the tie.
At night, Tyler and I were alone for half a mile in every direction.
Rain trickled down through the plaster and the light fixtures.
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.
Everywhere were rusted nails to snag your elbow on.
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
- What are you reading? - Listen to this.
It's an article written by an organ in the first person.
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata."
"Without me, Jack could not regulate his heart rate, blood pressure or breathing."
There's a whole series of these.
"I Am Jill's Nipples." "I Am Jack's Colon."
Yeah. "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."
After fighting, everything else in life got the volume turned down.
What?
- You could deal with anything. - Have you finished those reports?
If you could choose, who would you fight?
I'd fight my boss, probably.
Really?
- Yeah. Why? Who would you fight? - I'd fight my dad.
I don't know my dad.
I mean, I know him, but he left when I was, like, six years old.
Married this other woman and had some other kids. He did this every six years.
- He moves city and starts a new family. - Fucker's setting up franchises.
My dad never went to college, so it was real important that I go.
That sounds familiar.
So I graduate. I call him up long- distance and say, "Dad, now what?"
- He says, "Get a job." - Same here.
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again. "Dad, now what?"
He says, "I dunno. Get married."
You can't get married.
I'm a 30-year-old boy.
We're a generation of men raised by women.
I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.
Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.
But every Saturday night, we were finding something out.
We were finding out more and more that we were not alone.
It used to be when I came home angry or depressed, I'd just clean my condo,
polish my Scandinavian furniture.
I should've been looking for a new condo, haggling with my insurance company.
I should have been upset about my nice flaming little shit - but I wasn't.
The premise of cybernetting an office is make things more efficient.
Monday mornings, all I thought about was next week.
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
Absolutely.
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.
Because waste is a thief.
I showed this to my man here. You liked it, didn't you?
You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.
It was right in everyone's face. Tyler and I just made it visible.
It was on the tip of everyone's tongue. Tyler and I just gave it a name.
Come on, people, you've gotta go home!
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.
Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.
Gentlemen!
Welcome to Fight Club.
The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club.
The second rule of Fight Club is...
you do not talk about Fight Club!
Third rule of Fight Club: someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,
the fight is over.
Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight.
Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas.
Sixth rule: no shirts, no shoes.
Seventh rule: fights will go on as long as they have to.
And the eighth and final rule: if this is your first night, you have to fight.
This kid from work, Ricky,
couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black.
Ricky was a god for ten minutes when he trounced the maitre d' of a food court.
Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat, hard packing sounds over the yelling.
Or the wet choke when someone gasped and sprayed...
Stop!
You weren't alive anywhere like you were there.
But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and ends.
Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight, I wouldn't be talking to the same man.
Who you were in Fight Club is not who you were in the rest of the world.
A guy came to Fight Club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
If you could fight any celebrity, who would you fight?
- Alive or dead? - Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
Hemingway. You?
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
We all started seeing things differently.
Everywhere we went, we were sizing things up.
I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,
trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.
Is that what a man looks like?
Ah, self-improvement is masturbation.
Now, self-destruction...
Excuse me.
Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.
It wasn't about words.
The hysterical shouting was in tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.
- Is that it? - Stop!
When the fight was over, nothing was solved.
But nothing mattered.
Cool.
Afterwards, we all felt saved.
Hey, man. How about next week?
How about next month?
Irvine, you're in the middle. New guy, you too.
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.
He fell down some stairs.
I fell down some stairs.
Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails.
OK. Any historical figure.
- I'd fight Gandhi. - Good answer.
- How about you? - Lincoln.
- Lincoln? - Mm-hm.
Big guy, big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Fuck!
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.
- Hello? - Where've you been the last eight weeks?
Marla?
- How did you find me? - You left a forwarding number.
I haven't seen you at any support groups.
We split 'em up. That was the idea. Remember?
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.
- How do you know? - I cheated.
I found a new one.
- Really? - It's for men only.
Like the testicle thing? Wah!
- Look, this is a bad time. - I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.
- Some really fucked-up people. - I'm on my way out.
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.
I took what was left of a bottle. It might have been too much.
Picture Marla Singer throwing herself around her crummy apartment.
This isn't a for-real suicide. It's probably a cry for help.
This could go on for hours.
- So you're staying in tonight? - Do you wanna hear me describe death?
Do you wanna listen and see if my spirit can use a phone?
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for two months, his door was never closed.
- You won't believe the dream I had last night. - I hardly believe anything from last night.
What are you doing here?
- What? - This is my house. What're you doing here?
Fuck you!
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!
Limber, though. Silly cooze.
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook. Guess who's on the other end.
I knew the story before he told me.
Have you ever heard a death rattle before? Do you think it'll live up to its name?
Do you think it'll live up to its name? Or will it just be a death hairball?
Or will it just be a death hairball?
Prepare to evacuate soul.
Ten, nine, eight...
How could Tyler, of all people, think it was a bad thing
that Marla Singer was about to die?
..five, four, three...
Hang on.
You got here fast.
Did I call you?
Huh?
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.
Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.
Oh, fuck! Somebody called the cops.
- Hey, where's 513? - End of the hall.
The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl.
She has lost faith in herself.
- Miss Singer, let us help you! - She's a monster!
- You have every reason to live. - She's infectious human waste!
- Miss Singer! - Good luck trying to save her!
If I fall asleep, I'm done for.
You're gonna have to keep me up...
all night.
Un-fucking-believable.
He was obviously able to handle it.
- You know what I mean. You fucked her. - No, I didn't.
- Never? - No.
- You're not into her, are you? - No! God, not at all.
I am Jack's raging bile duct.
- Are you sure? You can tell me. - Believe me, I'm sure.
- Put a gun to my head, spray my brains. - That's good.
She's a predator posing as a house pet. Stay away from that one.
The shit that came out of this woman's mouth, I had never heard!
My God.
I haven't been fucked like that since grade school.
- Eugh! - How could Tyler not go for that?
The other night, he was splicing sex organs into "Cinderella".
Marla doesn't need a lover, just a caseworker.
And a wash. This isn't love, it's sport fucking.
She invaded my support groups and now my home.
Hey, hey. Sit down.
- I can't have you talking to her about me. - Why would I talk to her?
You say anything about me or what goes on in this house to anybody, we're done.
- Now, promise me. - OK.
- You promise? - I promise.
- Promise. - I just said, I promise! What...
That's three times you promised.
If only I had wasted a couple of minutes and gone to watch Marla Singer die,
none of this would've happened.
Yes! Oh, harder, harder!
I could have moved to another room.
On the third floor where I might not have heard them.
But I didn't.
- What are you doing? - Just going to bed.
- You wanna finish her off? - Ooh!
- No. No, thank you. - I found the cigarettes.
- Who were you talking to? - Shut up.
I became the calm little center of the world.
I was the Zen master.
I wrote little haiku poems.
I emailed them to everyone.
Is that your blood?
Some of it, yeah.
You can't smoke in here.
Take the rest of the day off. Come back Monday with clean clothes.
Get yourself together.
I got right in everyone's hostile face. "Yes, these are bruises from fighting."
"Yes, I'm comfortable with that. I am enlightened."
You give up the condo life and all your flaming worldly possessions,
go live in a dilapidated house in a toxic-waste part of town,
and you have to come home to this.
- Hello? - This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.
We have new information about the incident at your former condo.
- Yes? - I don't know if you're aware,
but someone sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.
They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
- No, I wasn't aware of that. - I am Jack's cold sweat.
- Does this sound strange to you? - Yes, sir. Very strange.
- The dynamite... - Dynamite?
..left a residue of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.
- Do you know what this means? - No. What does it mean?
It means it was home-made.
I'm sorry. This is just coming as quite a shock to me, sir.
Whoever set this dynamite could've blown your pilot light days before the explosion.
- The gas was just a detonator. - Who'd do such a thing?
- I'll ask the questions. - Tell him.
"The liberator who destroyed my property realigned my perceptions."
- Excuse me. Are you there? - Yes. Hard to know what to make of this.
Have you recently made enemies who might have access to home-made dynamite?
- Enemies? - "I reject civilization,
especially material possessions."
- Son, this is serious. - Yes, I know it's serious.
- I mean that. - Yes, it's very serious.
Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me. That condo was my life. OK?
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.
That was not just a bunch of stuff that got destroyed.
- It was me! - I thank the Academy.
- Is this not a good time for you? - Just tell him you fucking did it!
Tell him you blew it all up! That's what he wants to hear.
- Are you still there? - Are you saying that I'm a suspect?
No. I may need to talk to you, so you let me know if you're gonna leave town.
- OK? - OK.
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
My parents pulled this exact same act for years.
The condom is the glass slipper of our generation.
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.
You dance all night, then you throw it away.
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.
What?
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.
It was worth every penny.
It's a bridesmaid's dress.
Someone loved it intensely for one day,
then tossed it.
Like a Christmas tree.
So special.
Then... bam!
It's on the side of the road.
Tinsel still clinging to it.
Like a sex-crime victim, underwear inside out, bound with electrical tape.
Well, then, it suits you.
You can borrow it sometime.
Get rid of her.
- What? You get rid of her! - Don't mention me.
I am six years old again, passing messages between parents.
- It's time you left. - Don't worry, I'm leaving.
- Not that we don't love your visits. - You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.
Thanks. Bye.
You kids!
Why do you still waste time with her?
I'll say this about Marla. At least she's trying to hit bottom.
And I'm not?
Sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken.
What are we doing tonight?
Tonight... we make soap.
- Really? - To make soap, first we render fat.
The salt balance has to be just right, the best fat for soap comes from humans.
- Wait. What is this place? - A liposuction clinic.
Aha! Pay dirt!
Richest, creamiest fat in the world. The fat of the land!
No! Don't pull it.
- Oh, God! - I'll get another one.
As the fat renders, the tallows float to the surface. Like in Boy Scouts.
- It's hard to imagine you a Boy Scout. - Keep stirring.
Once the tallow hardens, you skim off a layer of glycerin.
Add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.
If you then add sodium nitrate and sawdust, you got dynamite.
With enough soap, one could blow up anything.
Tyler was full of useful information. Ancient peoples found clothes got cleaner when washed in one part of the river.
Ancient peoples found clothes got cleaner when washed in one part of the river.
- You know why? - No.
Humans were once sacrificed on the hills above.
Bodies burnt, water seeped through the ashes to create lye.
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.
Once it mixed with the melted body fat, a soapy discharge crept into the river.
May I see your hand, please?
What is this?
- This is a chemical burn. - Agh! Aaagh!
It'll hurt more than you've ever been burned and leave a scar.
If meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
- Don't shut the pain out. - Oh, God!
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes, like the first monkey shot into space.
Without pain or sacrifice, we would have nothing.
I tried not to think of the words "searing" or "flesh".
Stop it! This is your pain, this is your burning hand.
I'm going to my cave to find my power animal.
No! Don't deal with this the way those dead people do! Come on!
- I get the point! - No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.
It's the greatest moment of your life, and you're missing it!
I am not...
Shut up! Our fathers were our models for God.
If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God?
Listen to me. You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you.
He never wanted you. In all probability, he hates you.
This is not the worst thing that can happen. We don't need him!
- I agree! - Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!
- I'm getting water! - You can use water and make it worse or...
Look at me!
- ..or use vinegar to neutralize the burn. - Please let me up!
First, you have to give up.
First, you have to know - not fear -
know that someday, you're gonna die.
You don't know how this feels!
It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.
OK.
Congratulations. You're one step closer to hitting bottom.
Tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar. God knows what they charged.
- This is the best soap. - Why, thank you, Susan.
It was beautiful.
We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.
He was wearing his yellow tie.
I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore.
"The first rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club"?
I'm half-asleep again. I must have left it in the copy machine.
"The second rule..." Is this yours?
Huh?
Pretend you're me. Make a managerial decision.
You find this. What would you do?
Well, I gotta tell you,
I'd be very, very careful who you talk to about that.
Because the person who wrote that is dangerous.
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho might just snap
and then stalk from office to office
with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered semiautomatic weapon,
pumping round after round into colleagues and co-workers.
This might be someone you've known for years.
Someone very, very close to you.
Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.
And I used to be such a nice guy.
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me every piece of trash you pick up.
- Compliance and Liability. - My tit's gonna rot off.
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.
- What do you mean? - I need you to check for a lump in my breast.
- Go to a hospital. - I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.
I don't know about this, Marla.
Please?
She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.
That's nice. Taking food to Mrs... Haniver and Mrs. Raines.
Where are they, exactly?
Tragically, they're dead. I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?
- No, no. - I got one for you.
Thanks for the thought.
What happened to your hand?
Oh, nothing.
- Right there? - Mm.
- Feel anything? - No.
Well, make sure.
- OK, I'm pretty sure. - You feel nothing?
No, nothing.
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
- No problem. - I wish I could return the favor.
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.
- I could check your prostate. - I think I'm OK.
Well, thanks, anyway.
- Are we done? - Yeah, we're done.
See you... around.
Cornelius?
Cornelius!
It's me! Bob!
Hey, Bob.
- We all thought you were dead. - No, no. Still here.
- How are you, Bob? - Better than I've been in my whole life.
- Really? Still Remaining Men Together? - No. I got something much better now.
Really? What is it?
Well...
The first rule is, I'm not supposed to talk about it.
And the second rule is...
I'm not supposed to talk about it.
- And the third rule is... - Bob, Bob. I'm a member.
Look at my face, Bob.
That's fucking great.
- I've never seen you there. - I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- I go Saturday. - Congratulations.
Yeah. Hey, to both of us, right?
Have you heard about the guy that invented it?
- Yeah, actually... - I hear all kinds of things.
Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution
and he sleeps only one hour a night.
- He's a great man. - Oh...
Do you know about Tyler Durden?
I didn't hurt you, did I?
Actually, you did.
Thank you for this. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Fight Club.
This was mine and Tyler's gift.
Our gift to the world.
I look around, I look around, I see a lot of new faces.
Shut up!
Which means a lot of people have been breaking the first rules of Fight Club.
I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived.
I see all this potential. And I see it squandered.
Goddammit, an entire generation pumping gas,
or waiting tables.
Slaves with white collars.
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes,
working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need.
We're the middle children of history, men. No purpose or place.
We have no Great War,
no Great Depression.
Our great war is a spiritual war.
Our great depression is our lives.
We've all been raised on TV to believe that one day we'd be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars.
But we won't.
We're slowly learning that fact.
And we're very, very pissed off.
Yeah!
First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...
Who are you?
- Who am I? - Yeah.
There's a sign on the front that says Lou's Tavern.
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?
Tyler Durden.
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone. He don't own this place. I do.
- How much money does he get? - There is no money.
- Really? - Free to all.
- Ain't that something. - It is, actually.
Look, stupid fuck!
- I want everybody out of here right now. - Hey! You should join our club.
- Did you hear what I just said? - You and your friend.
You hear me now?
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.
Still not getting it.
Agh! OK, OK, I got it.
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.
Back! All of you!
Everybody back!
Ah, Lou!
Come on, man! We really like this place.
- That's right, Lou. Get it out. - Shut the fuck up.
Oh, yeah!
Is that fucking funny?
Fucking guy's a loony, I'm telling you.
Unbelievable.
- You don't know where I've been, Lou. - Oh, my God!
You don't know where I've been!
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!
- Fucking use the basement! Christ! - I want your word! I want your word!
On my mother's eyes.
Thanks, Lou.
You too, big guy.
We'll see you next week.
This week, each one of you has a homework assignment.
You're gonna go out. You're gonna start a fight with a total stranger.
You're gonna start a fight,
and you're gonna lose.
Excellent choice, sir.
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!
Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.
What... Son of a bitch!
Most people - normal people - do just about anything to avoid a fight.
Excuse me!
You sprayed me with your hose.
That's not necessary.
Jay! Go call 911!
Put the hose down.
Stop it! Stop it!
Sorry.
You bastard!
We need to talk.
OK.
Where to begin?
With your constant absenteeism?
With your unpresentable appearance?
- You're up for review. - I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
- What? - Let's pretend.
You're the Department of Transportation, OK?
Someone informs you that this company installs front-seat mounting brackets
that never pass collision tests,
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,
and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive.
What then?
- Are you threatening me? - No...
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired! - I have a better solution.
Keep me on the payroll as an outside consultant
in exchange for my salary, my job will be never to tell people things that I know.
I don't even have to come into the office. I can do this job from home.
Who... who the fuck do you think you are, you crazy little shit?
- Security! - I am Jack's smirking revenge.
Agh!
What the hell are you doing?
That hurt.
Why would you do that?
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!
What are you doing?
Oh, God, no! Please! No!
For some reason, I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.
No!
Under and behind and inside everything this man took for granted,
something horrible had been growing.
Look. Just give me the paychecks, like I asked, and you won't ever see me again.
And right then, at our most excellent moment together...
Thank God! Please don't hit me again.
Telephone, computer, fax, 52 weekly paychecks and 48 airline flight coupons.
We now had corporate sponsorship.
This is how Tyler and I were able to have Fight Club every night of the week.
Now, nobody was the center of Fight Club except the two men fighting.
The leader walked through the crowd, out in the darkness.
Tyler was now involved in a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel
over the urine content of their soup.
I am Jack's wasted life.
Thank you, sir.
Tyler dreamed up new homework assignments.
He handed them out in sealed envelopes.
- There's a Fight Club in Delaware City. - Yeah, I heard.
There's one in Penns Grove, too. Bob even found one up in New Castle.
- Did you start that one? - No, I thought you did.
No.
- Stop. - What are we doing?
- Turn around. - What are we doing?
- Homework assignment. - What kind?
Human sacrifice.
- Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not. - It's a gun. Meet me in the back.
- Don't fuck around! - Meet me in the back.
On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
- Stop. What are you doing? - Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.
Raymond K Hessel. 1320 SE Banning, Apartment A. Cramped basement apartment?
- How did you know? - They give shitty apartments letters.
Raymond! You're going to die.
No!
Is that your mom and dad? They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor.
Pick up your dental records. Know why?
- There'll be nothing left of your face. - Come on!
An expired community college student ID. What did you study, Raymond?
- S-Stuff. - Stuff?
Were the midterms hard?
- I asked you what you studied! - Biology, mostly.
- Why? - I don't know.
What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?
The question, Raymond, was: what did you want to be?
Answer him, Raymond! Jesus!
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian. - Animals.
- Yeah. Animals and stuff. - Stuff. Yeah, I got that.
- So you need more schooling. - Too much school.
- Would you rather be dead? - No, please...
You'd rather die here, on your knees, in the back of a convenience store?
No. Please, no.
I'm keeping your license.
Gonna check in on you. I know where you live.
If you're not on your way to being a veterinarian in six weeks, you will be dead.
Now, run on home.
Run, Forrest, run!
I feel ill.
- Imagine how he feels. - Come on, this isn't funny!
What the fuck was the point of that?
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K Hessel's life.
His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I have ever tasted.
You had to give it to him.
- Come on. - He had a plan.
And it started to make sense in a Tyler sort of way.
No fear. No distractions.
The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide.
You are not your job.
You're not how much money you have in the bank.
You're not the car you drive.
You're not the contents of your wallet.
You're not your fucking khakis.
You are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.
I'll be out of your way in a sec.
You don't have to go.
Whatever.
No, I mean... It's OK.
Are you still going to groups?
Yeah.
Chloe's dead.
Wow. Chloe.
When did that happen?
Do you care?
I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while.
Yeah, well...
It was the smart move on her part.
Listen, um...
What are you getting out of all this?
What?
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...?
Is this making you happy?
Yeah, well, sometimes.
I don't know. I don't understand.
Why does a weaker person need to latch on to a strong person? What is that?
What do you get out of it?
No... That's not the same thing at all. It's totally different with us.
"Us"?
- What do you mean by "us"? - I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
- Hear what? - All that noise. Hold on.
No, wait! Don't change the subject! I want to talk about this.
- You're not talking about me, are you? - No.
- What? - You playing doctor. What was going on?
- What are you talking about? - Nothing. Nothing.
- I don't think so. - What do you want?
- Look at me. - No. What?
- What is that? - It's nothing. Don't worry.
- My God. Who did this? - A person.
Guy or girl?
- What do you care? - What do you care if I ask?
- Leave me alone. - You're afraid to say.
- I am not. Let me go. - No! Talk to me.
Let go of me. Leave me alone!
- This conversation... - This conversation...
- ..is over. - ..is over.
I just can't win with you, can I?
Hey, this is getting a little old!
What is... what is all this?
What do you think?
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?
Hey!
Too young. Sorry.
What's all that?
Tell the applicant if he's too young, too old or too fat.
Applicant?
If the applicant waits three days without food or shelter, he may enter and begin training.
Training for what?
You think this is a game? You're too young to train here, end of story.
Quit wasting our time. Get the fuck out of here.
Bad news, friend.
It's not gonna happen.
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
It's not the end of the world. Just... go away.
Go.
You're trespassing and I will have to call the police.
Don't you look at me! You're never getting in this fucking house!
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch! Get off my porch!
Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.
I'm gonna go inside and I'm gonna get a shovel.
Got two black shirts? Two pair of black pants?
- Yes, sir. - One pair black boots? Black socks?
- Sir. - One black jacket?
- Sir. - $300 personal burial money? Yes, sir.
All right.
You're too old, fat man.
Your tits are too big. Get the fuck off my porch.
Bob! Bob!
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.
Space monkey.
Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good.
You are too fucking old, fatty!
And you... You're too fucking blond!
Get out of here, the both of you!
And so it went.
Listen up, maggots.
You are not special.
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.
You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else.
Tyler built himself an army.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.
We are all part of the same compost heap.
Why was Tyler Durden building an army?
To what purpose? For what greater good?
In Tyler we trusted.
No, no, no, no. When he was, like, "You are not your job," I was, like, "Yeah!"
- Hey, what's all this? - Hey!
OK!
- What's going on? - We're celebrating.
- What are we celebrating? - Go on.
- Hey. - Let me get that for you.
Same great taste. Pepsi. Generation Next.
Shh!
Investigators are on the scene. The police commissioner has arrived.
Could you tell us what you think has happened here?
We believe this is one of many recent acts of vandalism around the city
somehow related to underground boxing clubs.
We will be coordinating a rigorous investigation.
That was Commissioner Jacobs who just arrived on the scene
- of a four-alarm fire that broke out... - She's hot.
Back to you in the studio.
- Yeah! - Yeah!
- Holy shit! - Yeah!
What the fuck did you guys do?
Arson investigators are on the premises...
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions, sir.
The victory in the war against crime will not come overnight.
It will take dedication and commitment and, most of all, cooperation.
Streets are safer now. There is hope in the inner city.
- However... - I gotta take a piss.
These are the first steps in a long journey. That is why we created Project Hope...
Bob.
..helping others with prevention and enforcement.
Project Hope'll be a joint effort between the police and community leaders.
It will be a powerful new weapon in the war against crime.
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack. - Man! His balls are ice-cold.
Hi. You're gonna call off your rigorous investigation.
You will publicly state there is no underground group,
or these guys are gonna take your balls.
They'll send one to the New York Times and one to the LA Times.
Look, the people you are after are the people you depend on.
We cook your meals. We haul your trash. We connect your calls.
We drive your ambulances. We guard you while you sleep.
Do not fuck with us.
Ball check!
Bob, this way.
Let's go.
I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.
Hey!
Yeah!
I felt like putting a bullet in every panda that wouldn't screw to save its species.
I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers
and smother all those French beaches I'd never see.
I wanted to breathe smoke.
Where did you go, psycho boy?
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
- Get him to a fucking hospital. - Yeah.
Don't worry, Mr. Durden. Airport parking. Long term.
After you, Mr. Durden.
After you.
- Something on your mind, dear? - No.
Yeah. Why wasn't I told about Project Mayhem?
First rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions.
- Why wasn't I included in the beginning? - Fight Club was the beginning.
Now it's left the basements and it's Project Mayhem.
We started Fight Club together. Remember? It's as much mine as it is yours.
- Is this about you and me? - Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?
- Is this about you and me? - Yeah. Weren't we doing this together? This does not belong to us.
- We are not special. - Fuck that. You should have told me.
Hey, Tyler!
- Goddammit, Tyler! - What do you want?
A statement of purpose? Should I email you?
- Look... - You decide your level of involvement!
I will! I wanna know certain things first!
- The first rule of Project Mayhem... - Shut up!
- I wanna know what you're thinking. - Fuck what you know!
Forget about what you think you know about life, friendship,
and especially about you and me.
What is that supposed to mean? What...?
What are you doing?
What'll you wish you'd done before you die?
- Paint a self-portrait. - Build a house.
- And you? - I don't know. Nothing.
- Get in the right lane. - You have to know!
If you died now, how would you feel about your life?
I don't know! Nothing good. Is that what you want to hear me say?
- Come on! - Not good enough.
Stop fucking around! Tyler!
Jesus Christ!
Goddammit! Goddammit! Fuck you!
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla! I am sick of all your shit!
OK, man. OK.
- Quit screwing around. Steer! - Look at you!
- Steer! - Look at you! You're fucking pathetic!
- Why? What are you talking about? - Why'd you think I blew up your condo?
What?
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat. It's not a goddamn seminar.
Stop trying to control everything and just let go!
- Let go! - All right. Fine.
Fine.
I'd never been in a car accident.
This must have been what all those people felt like
before I filed them as statistics in my reports.
Goddamn!
We've just had a near-life experience!
In the world I see, you're stalking elk through the damp canyon forests
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.
You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life.
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower.
And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,
laying strips of venison in the empty car-pool lane of some abandoned superhighway.
Feel better, champ.
And then...
Tyler?
..Tyler was gone.
Was I asleep?
Had I slept?
You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...
The house had become a living thing,
wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing.
- We're all part of the same compost heap... - So many people moving, the house moved.
Planet Tyler.
I had to hug the walls, trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys.
You can't be smoking! You know how much ether is in here?
Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.
Hang on a second.
It's under control, sir.
Where's Tyler?
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not...
Right. OK.
I'm all alone.
My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.
I am Jack's broken heart.
What comes next in Project Mayhem, only Tyler knows.
The second rule is you do not ask questions.
Get the fuck away from me! Get the fuck away!
Who are all these people?
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Can I come in?
He's not here.
What?
Tyler isn't here.
Tyler went away.
Tyler's gone.
Jesus! Get some help!
Two gunshot wounds coming through! Make some fucking room!
What happened? What happened?
We were on assignment. We were supposed to kill two birds with one stone.
Destroy a piece of corporate art...
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.
We had it all worked out, sir.
- It went smooth until... - Police! Freeze!
- What? - They shot Bob.
- They shot him in the head. - Fucking pigs!
Oh, God!
- Those motherfuckers! - You morons.
You run around in ski masks trying to blow things up?
What did you think was gonna happen?
OK, quick! We gotta get rid of the evidence - this body!
- Bury him. - What?
Take him to the garden and bury him.
- Come on, people, let's go! - Get the fuck off! Get away from him!
What are you talking about? This isn't fucking evidence. This is a person.
He's my friend and you're not burying him in the garden!
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.
- This is Bob. - But, sir, in...
in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
You listen to me. This is a man and he has a name, it's Robert Paulsen, OK?
Robert Paulsen?
He's a man, and he's dead now because of us. Do you understand that?
I understand.
In death, a member of Project Mayhem has a name.
His name is Robert Paulsen.
His name is Robert Paulsen.
His name... is Robert Paulsen.
His name is Robert Paulsen.
- Come on, guys. Please. Stop it. - His name is Robert Paulsen.
Shut up! This is all over with!
- Tyler? - No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.
I need to see you...
I went to all the cities on Tyler's used ticket stubs, bar-hopping.
I didn't know how, but I could look at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.
I'm looking for Tyler Durden. It's very important that I talk to him.
I wish I could help you,
sir.
Every city I went to,
as soon as I set foot off the plane,
I knew a Fight Club was close.
Hey! Hey!
Taxi!
Look at my face. I'm a member. Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.
I'm not exposed to bespeak any such information to you,
nor would I, even if I had said information at this juncture, be able.
- You're a moron. - I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Tyler had been busy, setting up franchises all over the country.
Was I asleep? Had I slept?
Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?
- We've just heard the stories. - What stories?
- Nobody knows what he looks like. - He has plastic surgery every three years.
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami? - Is Mr. Durden building an army?
I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.
Everywhere I went, I felt I'd already been there.
It was like following an invisible man.
The smell of dried blood.
Dirty, bare footprints circling each other.
That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.
The feel of a floor still warm from a fight the night before.
I was always just one step behind Tyler.
His name is Robert Paulsen. His name is Robert Paulsen. His...
Welcome back, sir.
How have you been?
Do you know me?
- Is this a test, sir? - No. This is not a test.
You were in here last Thursday.
Thursday?
You were standing where you are now, asking how good security is.
It's tight as a drum, sir.
Who do you think I am?
- Are you sure this isn't a test? - No, this is not a test.
You're Mr. Durden.
You're the one who gave me this.
Please return your seat backs to their full upright and locked position.
- Yeah? - Marla, it's me.
- Have we ever done it? - Done what?
- Had sex. - What kind of stupid question is that?
Stupid because the answer's yes or because it's no?
- Is this a trick? - No. I need to know...
You wanna know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
- We did make love? - Is that what you're calling it?
Just answer the question! Did we do it or not?
You fuck me, then snub me. You love me, you hate me.
You're sensitive, then you turn into an asshole.
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?
We have just lost cabin pressure.
- What did you say? - What is wrong with you?
- Say my name! - Tyler Durden.
Tyler Durden, you fucking freak! What's going on?
- I'm coming over! - I'm not there!
You broke your promise.
- Jesus, Tyler. - You talked to her about me.
- What the fuck is going on? - I ask you for one thing. One thing.
Why do people think that I'm you?
Answer me!
Sit.
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?
I think you know.
- No, I don't. - Yes, you do.
Why would anyone possibly confuse you with me?
I... I don't know.
- You got it. - No.
- Do not fuck with us! - Say it.
Because...
Say it!
Because we're the same person.
That's right.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing...
- I don't understand this. - You wanted a way to change your life.
You could not do this on your own.
All the ways you wish you could be - that's me.
I look like you wanna look, fuck like you wanna fuck,
I am smart, capable, most importantly, I'm free in all the ways that you are not.
Oh, no.
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away. - What?
- This is impossible. This is crazy. - People do it every day.
They talk to themselves. They see themselves as they'd like to be.
They don't have the courage you have to just run with it.
You still wrestle with it, so sometimes you're still you.
We should do this again sometime.
Other times, you imagine you're watching me.
Other times, you imagine you're watching me. If this is your first time, you have to fight.
Little by little, you're just letting yourself become...
Tyler Durden.
Tyler Durden. You are not your job or how much money you have!
- No. You have a house. - Rented in your name.
- You have jobs, a life. - You work nights because you can't sleep.
- Or you stay up and make soap. - You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
Technically, you are. But it's all the same to her.
Oh, my God.
Now you see our dilemma.
She knows too much.
I think we're gonna have to talk about how this might compromise our goals.
What... what are you saying?
This is bullshit. This is bullshit! I'm not listening to this.
- You are insane! - No. You're insane.
And we simply do not have time for this crap.
It's called a changeover. The movie goes on, nobody in the audience has any idea.
- Sir! Are you checking out? - Yeah. Bill me.
I need you to initial this list of phone calls, please.
- When were these made? - Between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.
Have I been going to bed earlier every night? Have I been sleeping later?
Have I been Tyler longer and longer?
Is anybody here?
Déjà vu, all over again.
With enough soap, one could blow up anything.
Oh, my God.
- 1888. - Who am I calling?
1888 Franklin. This is Maintenance.
Hello? Hello?
1888 Franklin Street?
Yes. Can I help you?
- Hello? - Yeah, yeah.
I need to talk to your supervisor right away.
- Speaking. - OK, listen to me.
Something terrible is about to happen to your building.
It's under control, sir.
- Excuse me? - Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom! They almost broke my arm!
They were burning their fingertips with lye.
It'll take a tremendous act of faith on your part, but hear me out.
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit. - A little more faith than that.
- I don't wanna hear anything you have to say. - You have every right to be...
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.
Sir, anything you order is free of charge, sir.
- Why is it free of charge? - Don't ask.
Whatever.
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken, a baked potato, chocolate chiffon pie.
Clean food, please.
In that case, sir, I advise against the clam chowder.
No clam chowder. Thank you.
You got about 30 seconds.
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?
- I know it seems there's two sides to me... - Two sides? You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.
I deserved that. But I realized something important.
What?
The full extent of our relationship wasn't clear to me until now, for reasons I won't go into.
- I know I haven't treated you well. - Whatever.
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please! Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.
What I've come to realize is that I really like you, Marla.
- You do? - I really do.
I care about you, I don't want anything bad to happen to you because of me.
I care about you, I don't want anything bad to happen to you because of me. Your life is in danger.
- What? - You need to leave town for a while.
- Get out of any major city. Go camping... - You're an insane person.
- I've involved you in something terrible. - No. Shut up!
- You're not safe. - Shut up!
- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried. - I know you did.
There are things about you I like. You're smart, funny, spectacular in bed.
But... you're intolerable.
You have very serious emotional problems for which you should seek professional help.
- I know, and I'm sorry. - You're sorry, I'm sorry, everyone's sorry.
I can't do this anymore.
I can't. I won't.
- I'm gone. - You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!
- Marla, you don't understand! - Leave me alone!
- Marla, you don't understand! - Leave me alone! I am trying to protect you!
- I never want to see you again! - If that's what it takes...
Wait right here.
Hold it right there! Shut up!
Take this money and get on this bus. I promise I will never bother you again.
Shut up!
Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.
- Why are you doing this? - They think you're a threat.
I can't explain now. Trust me. If I see where you're going, you won't be safe.
I'm not paying this back. I consider it asshole tax.
Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities for a couple of days, OK?
Tyler...
You're the worst thing that ever happened to me.
Hello. I need you to arrest me.
I am the leader of a terrorist organization
responsible for numerous acts of vandalism and assault all over this city.
In the metropolitan area, we had probably 200 members.
Chapters have sprung up in five or six other major cities already.
This is a tightly regimented organization
with many cells capable of operating independent of central leadership.
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street. That's our headquarters.
In the back, buried in the garden, you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.
In the basement, you'll find bathtubs
that have been used very recently to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
I believe the plan is to blow up the headquarters of these credit-card companies
and the TRW building.
Why these buildings? Why credit-card companies?
If you erase the debt record, then we all go back to zero.
You'll create total chaos.
Keep him talking. I need to make a phone call.
I really admire what you're doing.
- What? - You're a brave man to order this.
You're a genius, sir.
You said if anyone ever interferes with Project Mayhem, even you,
we gotta get his balls.
- Don't fight. - It's a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.
- It'll set quite an example. - You're making a big mistake!
- You said you'd say that. - I'm not Tyler Durden!
You told us you'd say that too.
All right. I am Tyler Durden.
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order. We're aborting this mission now.
You said you would definitely say that.
Let me go!
Are you fucking out of your minds? You're police officers!
Is somebody timing this?
Keep your mouth shut.
Shit!
- Some of this information checks out. - Uh-huh?
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street. - Be right there.
Hey, wait!
- Got him? - I got him.
Sir, we have to do this.
- Stop fighting! - Where's the rubber band?
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!
Get down on the floor!
First person that comes out this door gets a lead salad! Understand?
Get away! Stay away!
I ran.
I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid.
Then I ran some more.
What are you doing, running around in your underpants? You look crazy!
No. I'm onto you. I know what's going on here.
Come on, then. I got us a great place to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.
Oh, Christ.
Now what are you doing?
- I'm stopping this. - Why?
- The greatest thing you've ever done. - I can't let this happen.
There are 10 other bombs in 10 other buildings.
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
The buildings are empty. We're not killing anyone. We're setting 'em free!
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.
You wanna make an omelet, you gotta break eggs.
You wanna make an omelet, you gotta break eggs. I'm not listening to you. You're not even there.
Wouldn't do that. Not unless I knew which wires were what.
If you know, then I know.
Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent all day thinking about the wrong ones.
You think?
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.
Pull any one but the green one.
I asked you not to do that!
Fuck!
Tyler, get away from the van.
Tyler, I'm not kidding! Get away from the van!
Goddammit!
Whoa! Whoa!
OK.
You are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
Cool it, Tyler!
Aw, come on! Don't go!
What?
Three minutes. This is it.
The beginning.
Ground zero.
- I think this is about where we came in. - Want to say a few words for the occasion?
I'm sorry?
I still can't think of anything.
Ah. Flashback humor.
It's getting exciting now.
Two and a half. Think of everything we've accomplished.
Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history.
One step closer to economic equilibrium.
- Why is she here? - I'm tying up loose ends.
Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!
- I'm begging you, please don't do this. - I'm not doing this. We are doing this.
- This is what we want. - No. I don't want this.
Right. Except "you" is meaningless now. We have to forget about you.
- You're a voice in my head. - You're a voice in mine!
You're a hallucination. Why can't I get rid of you?
- You need me. - No. I don't. I really don't any more.
You created me. I didn't create some loser alter ego to make me feel better.
- Take some responsibility. - I do.
I am responsible for all of it, and I accept that.
So, please, I'm begging you, please call this off.
Have I ever let us down?
How far have you come because of me?!
I will bring us through this.
As always, I will carry you kicking and screaming,
and in the end you will thank me.
Tyler. Tyler.
I'm grateful to you for everything that you've done for me.
But this is too much. I don't want this.
What do you want? Your shit job back? Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?
Fuck you! I won't do it.
- This can't be happening. - It's already done, so shut up!
- 60 seconds till CRI. - No.
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.
You're not real. That gun... that gun isn't even in your hand.
The gun's in my hand.
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?
Not my head, Tyler.
Our head.
Interesting.
Where are you going with this, IKEA boy?
Hey. It's you and me.
Friends?
Tyler,
I want you to really listen to me.
OK.
My eyes are open.
What's that smell?
- Where is everybody? - Oh, no. What's going on?
Mr. Durden!
Oh, my God!
Sir!
Are you... are you all right, sir?
- Oh, yeah, I'm OK. - You look terrible, sir. What happened?
- Oh, nothing. It's no problem. - No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.
- You look awful. You need assistance. - I'm fine.
Look, I'm fine. Everything's fine.
Ow! Stop it!
- Let her go. - Christ Almighty!
You!
Hi, Marla.
Leave her with me. I'll meet you downstairs. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.
- Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.
You fucker! What sick fucking game are you playing at, putting me on a...?
Oh, my God, your face!
Yeah, I know.
- What happened? - Don't ask.
- You're shot. - Yes, I'm shot.
Oh, my God.
- I can't believe he's standing. - Tough motherfucker.
Who did this?
I did, actually.
Find some gauze.
- You shot yourself? - Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.
I'm really OK.
We made it, Commander. We made it.
By Grabthar's hammer, we live to tell the tale.
[computer] Systems register functional.
All systems are working, Commander.
I don't like it. It was too easy.
-[Tommy] Wait! -[alarm buzzing]
Oh, no. They're everywhere! There are time knots opening everywhere!
-A trap! -We're surrounded, Commander.
It's a core meltdown, Sir. It can't be stopped.
Surrender may be our only option.
No! Never give up! Never surrender!
Your orders, Sir?
-[epic music playing] -Sir? Your orders?
Activate the Omega 13.
-[audience applauding] -[Guy] Well?
Huh?
-Well, there you are. Yeah! -[audience cheering]
[Guy] Yeah! Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!
You are the first people to see
the lost Galaxy Quest Episode 92 two-parter
since it was originally aired in 1982! Huh?
Yeah! All right.
And now, the moment you've all been waiting for.
The intrepid crew of the NSEA Protector! Yeah!
[Fred] Red scarf, black shoes. Wait.
White scarf, black buttons, white shoes…
Man, where the hell is he? An hour and a half late?
-An hour and a half. -I mean, this is unreal.
They're gonna start eating each other out there.
Oh, did you hear? He booked another appearance without us.
You're kidding!
-How did I come to this? -Not again.
-I played Richard the Third. -Five curtain calls.
There were five curtain calls. I was an actor once,
damn it, now look at me. Look at me!
I can't go out there, and I won't say that stupid line one more time!
-I can't, I won't. -Well, Alex, at least you had a part.
Okay? You had a character people loved.
I mean, my TV Guide interview was six paragraphs about my boobs
and how they fit into my suit.
No one even bothered to ask me what I do on the show.
You had the… Wait. Wait, I'll think of it.
-[Gwen] I repeated the computer, Fred. -[door opens]
[exhales] Your commander is on deck!
[laughs] Wow, that smog is thick today, huh?
Am I too late for Alexander's panic attack?
Apparently not. You know, you should get that looked at. [laughs]
Yeah.
[Guy] Let's take a look at a few more clips.
Okay. What did I do, hmm?
-What? -[crowd chanting] We want the crew!
-We want the crew! -[Guy] For those four seasons,
we developed the same affection for the crew
as the crew had for each other.
I mean, these weren't just adventurers exploring space. These were friends.
-Unbelievable. -You are so full of it, man!
It's not a big deal. These guys put a little set in their basement.
I'm there about an hour.
It's nothing, Gwen. They wanted the Commander.
[Alexander] There he goes. [Jason] Alexander, wait! Grab him! Grab him!
-We want the crew! -We want the crew!
-Okay! Yeah! Here we go! -[crowd cheering]
-Come on, old friend, old friend. -Friend?
You stole all my best lines, you cut me out of episode two entirely!
[Guy] Tawny Madison, my personal favorite, Gwen DeMarco!
-[whoops] -Yeah!
It's getting hotter, Commander.
[fan] Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!
Let's hear a warm welcome for crack gunner Laredo, Tommy Webber!
-You will go out there! -I won't.
And nothing you say will make me.
-The show must go on. -[Guy] Freddie Kwan!
Damn you.
Damn you. I won't say that stupid line one more time.
[Guy] Tev'Meck, Alexander Dane!
Yeah! All right!
By Grabthar's hammer, you shall be avenged!
[Guy] Yeah! All right!
That guy can act.
-[whispers indistinctly] -[Guy] And finally, my fellow Questerians,
the brave commander of the NSEA Protector,
Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter…
Quincy, Quincy, Quincy, Quincy, Quincy…
Taggart, Taggart, Taggart, Taggart…
-Jason Nesmith! Yeah! -[crowd cheers]
[Guy] All right!
[female fan] We love you, Commander!
-Never give up. -Never give up. -[all] Never surrender! -[Jason] Never surrender!
-Damn the resonance cannons. -Damn the resonance cannons. -Full speed ahead! -Full speed ahead! Huh?
[Guy] The commander and his crew will be signing autographs
on imperial decks C and B near the Coke machines. [fan] You guys rock! Whoo! Quest forever, man!
[fan] You guys rock! Whoo! Quest forever, man!
[Guy] Excuse me, pardon me, crew member coming through.
-Fans, right? Hey, Gwen. -[Tommy] Oh, hey, man.
I want to thank you for that nice intro you gave us today. Um…
Guy. You probably don't remember me, do you? It's the sunglasses, right?
I was on the show in '82, episode 81.
Got killed by a lava monster before the first commercial. [screams]
Listen, uh, thinkin' maybe I could sit in and sign a couple of autographs?
By Grabthar's hammer, by the Sons of Warvan, I shall avenge you!
By Grabthar's hammer--
Next.
Had I moved an inch to the left, the beast would have killed me.
-On the other hand, my crew was in danger. -How did you know what to do?
Come on! Without my crew, I'm not a commander, huh?
I think we all remember what happened to that beast on Enok VII, right?
You've got to admit, they really do love him.
Yeah, almost as much as he loves himself.
Excuse me, Commander. Hey!
I was wondering if you could help settle the dispute that my crew and I seem to be having.
Um, if you remember, in "Quasar Dilemma"--
Excuse me for a minute, fellas.
Hadn't even gotten to the relevant conundrum.
In episode 15, "Mist of Delos 5,"
I got the feeling that you and the commander kind of had a thing.
Did you?
-No the commander and I never had a thing. -Well, that's her story.
Excuse me.
Gwen.
Gwen!
Gwen!
-Commander. -[Jason] Excuse me.
I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance.
We are Thermians from the Klaatu Nebula, and we need your help.
Is this about that gig tomorrow?
Just hammer out the details with my agent, and make sure there's a limo at my house.
Last time I did one of these gigs, they shoved me in the back of a Toyota.
Remember, mum's the word.
Certainly, but…
[photographer] Look here, and beautiful!
Crewman Madison, the mist of this strange planet is filling
my head with such thoughts.
It was cute when I didn't know you.
[laughs] What a freak show, man. This is hilarious.
Bunch of losers! Begging for autographs at 15 bucks a pop.
These guys haven't had a real acting job for 20 years. This is all they've got.
[boy 1] And did you check out Nesmith?
-He actually gets off on those retards… -[boy 2] Oh, yeah. [boy 1] …thinking he's a space commander!
-[boy 2] And his friends… -[boy 1] I know, they can't stand him! Did you hear 'em ragging on him in there?
Dude, he has no idea he's a laughingstock, even to his buddies.
He's pathetic!
[boy 2] Come on, come on. The Galaxy Quest dancers are almost on.
[boy 1] Full speed ahead, Lieutenant.
[Brandon] Hey, Commander, uh,
so, as I was saying, in "The Quasar Dilemma," remember, you used the auxiliary of deck B for--
Could you get this? Deck B for gamma override.
The thing is that online blueprints clearly indicate
that deck B is independent of the guidance matrix.
So, we were wondering, just where the error lies in that?
It's just a television show. That's all, okay?
Right, but… 'Cause we were wondering if the quantum flux, now just listen--
[Jason] There is no quantum flux. There's no auxiliary. There's no goddamn ship!
You got it?
I mean it. I mean it, Alex. I've never seen him lose it like that. Not to a fan.
I mean, it was just weird.
Gwen, I have said it for years. He's mentally unstable.
[sighs] I-- I'm worried. It just was not like him.
[Taggart] As long as there is injustice,
whenever a Targathian baby cries out,
wherever a distress signal sounds…
Among the stars… [Taggart] …among the stars, we'll be there.
This fine ship and this fine crew. [Taggart] This fine ship and this fine crew.
-Never give up. -[Taggart] Never give up.
Never surrender.
Never surrender.
-Can I help you? -Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach in protocol…
-You shouldn't come to my house, man. -Please, I beg you to hear our plea.
We are Thermians from the Klaatu Nebula.
Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered
by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. We are to meet in negotiation.
However, our efforts in this regard have been disastrous.
Please, Commander. You are our last hope.
-We have secured our limousine. -What?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, um…
It's the thing for the thing that's…
Maybe I should get some pants on.
Come on in.
Commander, I must say that standing here in your presence
is the greatest honor we could ever have hoped to achieve in our lifetimes.
That's… I really appreciate that.
Would you guys look for another shoe that looks like this, please?
Sir, I am Lahnk, senior requisition officer.
Before we travel to the ship, please let me know if you have any requirements.
Weapons, documents, personnel.
A Coca-Cola, do you have one of those?
Sir, I am Teb.
I would like to explain the history between our people and the Sarris dominion in greater detail.
Hey, how you doing?
In the five million years following the Great Nebula Burst,
-our people were one p-- -What's your name?
-Doesn't she talk? -Her translator is broken.
Okey-dokey.
You know, guys, I had a late night with a Kreemorian Fangor Beast,
so, um, I'm gonna just shut my eyes for a bit.
Go on. You know, I'm listening to everything you say, okay?
In the five million years following the Great Nebula Burst, our people were one people.
But then came the Zactor Migration, and then the Melosian Shift…
…and a dark period of discontent spread through the land.
Fighting among Treeb sects and Largoths. The foolishness!
And it was in this time of dissension that Sarris…
[Laliari] Commander. Commander?
I'm sorry to wake you, Sir, but your presence is requested on the command deck.
Sir, Sarris has moved the deadline. We are-- We are approaching his ship at the Ni-Delta now.
He wants an answer to his proposal. I understand--
I got most of it in the car. Sarris is the bad guy, right?
Oh, yes, Sir. He's a very bad man indeed. He has tortured our scientists,
put us to work in the gallium arsenide mines,
captured our females for his own demented purposes--
Yeah, yeah. I got the picture. Do you have pages or do you just want me to wing this?
-I am not sure I understand you. -Commander, welcome to the Protector Two.
-Good to see you. -Would you like to don your uniform?
No, you know what? I'd like to skip that. I got this gig in Van Nuys
-in about a quarter of an hour. All right? -As you wish.
Sir, it's Sarris. He's here.
General, I have just received word the Thermians have appointed a new commander
to handle the negotiations.
What?
[Jason] This is great. You know, usually it's just the cardboard walls and a garage.
[Teb] Sir, we apologize for operating in low-power mode,
but we are experiencing a reflective flux field this close to the galactic axis.
You know, what I could use is a cup holder and a couple of Advil.
We're approaching in five ticks, Sir. Command to slow?
Set it on screensaver two.
[laughs] I guess, we, you know, got to…
I'm sorry to break the-- The mood here. Uh…
-Slow it down to mach two, Lieutenant. -[Sarris] I see fear. That is expected.
-They bring a new commander. -It's good.
-[Sarris] Here are my demands. -Scary. I mean, you know, it looks…
[Sarris] And if I do not hear what I like… …real.
[Sarris] …then there will be blood and pain as you cannot imagine!
-First… -[exhales] Backwash.
…I require the Omega 13.
Second, I will require a technician--
Okey-dokey! Okey-dokey! Let's fire blue particle cannons full,
red particle cannons full,
gannet magnets, fire them left and right, and let 'em run all chutes.
And while you're at it, why don't you toss that at 'em, killer?
That should take care of old lobster head, shouldn't it?
Yeah.
-Commander, where are you going? -Home.
-You-- You mean Earth? -Yeah, Earth.
-I need to get back to Earth, kids. -But the negotiations, you fired on him.
Yeah, yeah. Long live, uh, what was your planet called?
-Thermia. -Long live Thermia! This way?
What if Sarris survives?
-I doubt it. We gave him both barrels. -He has a very powerful ship.
If you got any more problems with the guy, just, you know, give me a call-- Ouch!
-An interstellar vox. -A what? Hey.
[Mathasar] How can we thank you, Commander?
You… You have saved our people.
Yeah. Okay. You know, you kids have been great. You really have.
This thing is real-looking. Yoo-hoo. Hello?
Hey! Where's my limo?
[Gwen] Take it from us, we've been all over the universe.
[Fred] But we've never seen space-age values like we've seen here
-at-- -Tech Value Electronics Superstore!
By Grabthar's hammer…
what a savings.
All right! Yeah, let's hear it for the NSEA Protector.
A vacuum laser… What, no, no, no, no. You've got it all wrong.
If he's found in the Omega 13--
-Brandon, are you okay? -[Brandon] Commander! My apologies.
You know, evidently, we had a little miscommunication
regarding the voyage.
You didn't show up. [pants]
[Kyle] He did it again.
[Alexander] Do you know what time it is? -Why do you even bother to show up at all? -No, no, no, no. Guys, I was there.
-Why do you even bother to show up at all? -No, no, no, no. Guys, I was there.
I was up there.
Remember yesterday at the convention, those people dressed like aliens?
They were aliens. They were Termites or Dalmatians.
I can't really remember 'cause I was kind of hungover.
But what they built was extraordinary. It was a huge spaceship!
I got to fight this guy named Sarris, and I kicked his ass!
I know what you're thinking. But I can prove it. They gave me this.
No, no, no, no, no. But can you talk to people in space on those?
Protector, this is the commander. Over.
-Oh, for God's sake. -That's it. It's time to go!
This isn't mine.
That kid. Where's that kid?
Begging your pardon, Commander, we come with news.
-Sarris lives. He was able… -Listen.
-…upon your departure to make an escape. -Tell them. Sarris.
However, he has contacted us and wishes to negotiate a surrender.
We humbly implore you to come and negotiate the terms.
They want me back? You want me back?
Isn't this amazing? They want me back, and I want you guys to go with me, please.
Don't even think about it. Let's go. Yes!
You're going? Alexander, this is not-- I'm not kidding here!
This isn't some kind of prank! I'm not kidding. Guys, guys, listen.
Come on. Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen. Stop, come here.
You know me. I'm a lot of things, but am I crazy?
You know, it's one thing to treat us this way.
It's another thing to do it to your fans.
She's not a fan! This is-- This is a Termite!
You should've just let me hit him.
Boy, I didn't know you could get that loaded.
I think we should've just taken the gig.
I mean, who knows the next time he'll ask us.
Fred, he was drunk. Do you really think he was talking about a job?
But you live with your mother.
-Did Jason come through here? -Yeah, he's-- He's in there. Hey, guys.
We are coming, too.
-All of you wish to go to the ship? -Yes, we wish to go to the ship.
You see, we work together, or not at all.
Wonderful. The Commander had me continue transmission in case you changed your mind.
-Protector, requesting four interstellar-- -Wa-- Me, too.
[Laliari] Five pods for immediate departure.
Guys.
Guys?
I look forward to meeting you all in person when you arrive at the ship.
End transmission.
-[liquid gushing] -Oh, my God.
-Anybody got any change? -[epic music playing]
Our most sincere apologies.
We forgot about our appearance generators.
You guys came! Who wants the grand tour?
Anybody else?
That was a hell of a thing.
-What's wrong with them? -I don't know. Come on.
That's right, guys, keep shaking it off, it gets better. Hey.
-Try some gum. It helps. -[Tommy] Where are we?
The 23rd quadrant of the Gamma Sector. There's a map in the core room. I'll show you, come on.
-Welcome, my friends! -This is Mathesar, he's their leader.
I am Mathesar. On behalf of all my people, I wish to thank you
-from the deepest place in our hearts. -Mathesar, this is my crew.
Dr. Lazarus.
-Dr. Lazarus. -Dr. Lazarus.
Lieutenant Madison.
-Lieutenant Madison. -Lieutenant Madison.
Young Laredo, how you've grown.
-Young Laredo. -Young Laredo.
Tech Sergeant Chen.
-Tech Sergeant Chen. -Tech Sergeant Chen.
Crewman number… Guy.
-Guy. -Guy.
You… know us?
I don't believe there is a man, woman or child on my planet who does not.
For years since we first received transmission of your historical documents,
we have studied every facet of your missions and strategies.
You've been watching the show?
Lieutenant, historical documents.
Historical documents from out here?
Yes. The past 100 years, our society had fallen into disarray.
Our goals, our values had become scattered, but since the transmission,
we have modeled every aspect of our society from your example,
and it has saved us.
Your courage and teamwork and friendship through adversity.
In fact, all you see around you has been taken from the lessons
garnered from the historical documents.
Is this a… a spaceship?
No, this is a star port for the ship.
Would you guys like to see the ship?
[Alexander] Oh, my God!
It's real.
[Mathasar] The generator room. The beryllium sphere, of course.
And as we continue, the medical quarters are to the left.
We went to some trouble duplicating your cellular regeneration system…
-Jason, what have you got us into? -What the hell is going on? -What are we doing here? -Wow, the floors are so clean.
We're just here to negotiate this guy Sarris' surrender. It's no big deal.
And the organ fabrication chamber is coming along nicely.
It's no big deal? Are you crazy? We have to get out of here.
-Come on, guys. -Jason, we're actors, not astronauts.
You guys want to go home? You say the word, we'll go home. Pay our bills, feed our fish,
fall asleep in front of the TV and miss out on all of this.
Come on. Do you guys want to do that? Anybody?
Gwen, come on, think about it. Look at where we are. We're in space.
Alexander, this is the role of a lifetime. You guys want to leave?
[Mathasar] We have enjoyed preparing many of your esoteric dishes.
Your Monte Cristo sandwich is a current favorite of the adventurous.
The main barracks.
[Jason] At ease.
It's like throwing gasoline on a flame.
What?
I'm just jazzed about being on the show, man.
[Mathasar] If you would all take your positions.
[Gwen] Our what?
Guys.
-Oh. Oh. -Oh.
[Tommy] Look, this thingy!
I remember-- I remember I had it all worked out.
This is forward. This is back.
Commander, some of the crew has requested to be present at this historic event.
Sure. Bring 'em in.
No pressure, huh? I'm glad I ain't the commander. [laughs]
Laredo, take us out.
Excuse me?
They designed those controls after watching you.
-Take her out. -[clears throat]
Right, right.
Okay. Right.
Right. Take her out.
Okay, you got to move to the right. Move more to the right.
Would you sit your ass down? Sit! Move! You want to drive this thing?
How are you enjoying your steak, Commander?
I'm really enjoying it. This is like corn-fed Iowa beef.
Yes. We programmed the food synthesizer for each of you based on the regional menu of your birthplace.
I don't care where you did it, it tastes great.
Are you enjoying your Kep-mok blood ticks, Dr. Lazarus?
Just like Mother used to make.
So, um, tell me, Mathesar,
this Sarris person that we're flying to meet, what does he want exactly?
He heard about the device, the Omega 13.
Um, what is it? What does it do?
We don't know.
We were hoping you could enlighten us.
Oh, the Omega 13 device.
We found that on an alien planet. We don't know what it does either.
Why don't you just turn it on and see what it does? -[speaks alien language] -[laughs]
It has at its heart a reactor capable of unthinkable energy.
If we were mistaken in our construction, the device would act as a molecular explosive,
causing a chain reaction that would obliterate all matter in the universe.
Has Sarris ever seen any of the historical records?
No, thank God, he has not.
So, how does he know about the Omega 13 device?
Our former commander was not… strong.
"Former commander"?
I am sorry. You deserve to be shown.
The tape was smuggled off of Sarris' ship.
Originally, one of our own tried to lead.
[Sarris] Is that all?
After three days of this, you still require incentive?
[alien commander] I have told you all I know. If you have any mercy within you, please, let me die.
[Sarris] When I grow weary of the noises you make, you shall die.
[Jason] Hey, guys, come on, hold on a minute! You just can't leave. Give me some time to think.
-Think. -He wants to think.
No, Jason. That's a wrap. There's nothing to think about!
I'm not even supposed to be here. I'm just crewman number six. I'm expendable.
I'm the guy in the episode who dies to prove the situation is serious.
-I got to get out of here. -[Mathasar] Commander! Commander?
We got to prepare the pods for my crew's departure.
But begging your commander's pardon, Sir, we can't launch pods at the moment. Sarris will surely detonate any objects leaving the ship.
-Sarris? -Yes, Sir. He's here now.
Your presence is required on the command deck.
There's nobody here.
While my people are talented scientists,
our attempt to operate our own technologies under tactical simulation have been disastrous.
I have raised Sarris on zeta frequency.
-Mathesar, it might be helpful-- -We meet again, Commander.
[Jason] Hello, Sarris. How you doing?
Better than my lieutenant.
He failed to activate the ship's neutron armor
as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Yeah, well, you know, I'd like to say I'm real sorry about what happened before.
The whole thing was just-- Just a misunderstanding.
Deliver the device to me, or I will destroy your ship!
You know, um, we'd like to do that,
but frankly, Sarris, Sir, we don't know what it is or even where it is.
You have ten seconds!
I-- I don't-- Ten seconds? I don't-- There…
You know, okay. Gosh, darn it, I give up. It's yours, you can have it.
You have to give me a minute to put it in a box for you, okay?
Gwen. [clicks]
Don't panic. I've dealt with this guy before. -He's as stupid as he is ugly. Come here. -Jason.
Not now, Gwen. -No! -Sit, sit, sit, sit.
We're gonna send everything we can at him, all right?
-[Gwen] Jason. -Not now, Gwen!
Push these red buttons and send everything we have towards him, okay?
-[Guy] Okay. -All right, Gwen…
-[clears throat] Put me back on with him. -[Gwen] Well, I'm trying to tell you,
you are back with him.
Perhaps I'm not as stupid as I am ugly, Commander!
I gave you the… "Kill" gesture.
Yeah. No, you gave me the "We're dead" signal. I was agreeing with you.
-Like I know where the hold button is. -[Guy] Hey, you guys.
There-- There's a red thingy
-moving toward the green thingy. -What?
Red thingy moving toward the green thingy.
I think-- I think we're the green thingy.
A little present for you, Commander.
We got to get out of here! Move the ship! Turn it! Move it! Let's go!
-[explosion] -Oh, no!
Oh, my God!
-Tommy, let's go! Get us out of here! -Jason, what do I do?
Let's go! Go, go, go!
They're turning. They're coming!
Thrust ahead, full!
Fire at will.
-Go faster, Tommy! -I'm going as fast as I can, Jason!
She's still behind us!
Well, press "Turbo." I've always said, "Press the turbo," right?
-It's right here! -Well, press it and hold it down!
[computer] The enemy is matching velocity.
-Enemy is matching velocity. -We heard it the first time!
Gosh, I'm doing it. I'm repeating the darn computer.
Hi, guys. Listen,
they're-- They're telling me the, uh… that the generators won't take it.
The ship is breaking apart and all that. Just FYI.
-We've got to stop! -We stop and we die.
-Tommy, just hold that thing down! -You cannot hold the turbo down!
-It's for quick boosts! -Oh, like you know!
I remember that sound. That's a bad sound.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! We might be able to lose them in this cloud here.
-I don't-- I don't think that's a cloud. -Mathesar, what is it?
This is the Tothian minefield left standing from the great war of 12185.
Oh, God! Oh!
Could you possibly try not to hit every single one?
Sorry, man, they're drifting towards us. I think they're magnetic!
Continue forward, Sir?
Patience, Lieutenant.
Patience.
-We've got to stop! -We're almost through this.
-You okay? You all right? -Yeah.
Everybody all right? Where's Tommy?
-[Jason] Tommy! You all right? -Oh, man!
No, my arm is broke. Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
-I'll take him to medical quarters. -Thanks, Mathesar.
Alex, where are you going?
To see if there's a pub!
[computer] Forward thruster shaft, 87 percent damage.
Aft vector guards, 96 percent damage.
Structural breaches in quadrants 32, 34, 40…
What about the engines? [computer] Forward thruster shaft, 87 percent damage.
Computer, what about the engines? Why don't we have power?
[computer] The beryllium sphere has fractured under stress.
It's fractured.
Can it be repaired?
Computer, can it be repaired? [computer] Damage to beryllium sphere, irreparable.
New source of beryllium must be secured. We need another one.
You broke the ship. You broke the bloody ship!
Computer, is there a replacement beryllium sphere on board?
Computer, is there a replacement beryllium sphere on board?
[computer] Negative. No reserve beryllium sphere exists on board.
No, we have no extra beryllium sphere on board.
You know, that is really getting annoying!
Look, I have one job on this lousy ship.
It's stupid, but I'm gonna do it, okay?
Sure, no problem.
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
How have you failed us?
We have seen you victorious in much more desperate situations.
The fault must lie with us, with the ship.
No, Mathesar, it is not your fault, and it's not the ship's fault.
It's-- It's my fault. We-- We-- This group, um…
We are not the people you think we are.
I don't understand.
Didn't you make any TV shows on your planet? Any theater? Films?
The historical documents of your culture.
Yes. In fact, we have begun to document our history from your example.
No, no, not historical documents. They're not all historical documents.
I mean, surely you don't think that Gilligan's Island is a…
Those poor people.
[Tommy] Oh, brother.
We're screwed.
Is there no one on your planet who behaves in a way
that's contrary to reality?
You are speaking of…
-Deception, lies. -…deception, lies.
We have only recently become aware of this concept
in our dealings with Sarris.
Often, Sarris will say one thing and do another.
Promise us mercy, but deliver destruction.
It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.
But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris…
Hey, Commander, listen. We found some beryllium on a nearby planet.
And we might be able to get there if we reconfigure the solar matrix
in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
-We'll do that! -All right!
That's right again. That's-- Come on, group hug. Come on.
Dr. Lazarus, I hope I am not breaching protocol,
but I am so very humbled to stand in your presence.
I have studied your missions extensively.
Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy,
by the code of the Mak'Tar.
Oh, good, that's… very nice.
-By Grabthar's hammer, Dr. Lazarus-- -Don't do that.
-I'm not kidding. -I'm sorry, Sir, I was only--
Just don't.
Yes, Sir.
Never give up. Never surrender.
Dr. Lazarus? Here is your surface mapper.
I have programmed it to the coordinates of a beryllium sphere
-of sufficient density. -[beeps]
Good luck on your mission, Sir.
Thanks.
You're doing good, Tommy.
I changed my mind. I want to go back.
After the fuss you made about getting left behind?
Yeah, but that's when I thought I was the crewman that stays on the ship
and something is up there, then it kills me.
But now I'm thinking I'm the guy who gets killed by some monster five minutes after we land on the planet!
You're not gonna die on the planet, Guy.
I'm not? Then what's my last name?
It's, uh… I don't know.
Nobody knows! Do you know why?
Because my character isn't important enough for a last name.
Because I'm gonna die five minutes in.
Guy, you have a last name.
-Do I? Do I? -[Gwen] Yes!
For all you know, I'm just crewman number six.
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! [sobs]
Are we there yet?
-[Guy] Mommy! -[Jason] Tommy!
-[Gwen] Look out! -[Alexander] Oh, no! Pull out!
[Guy] Oh, yeah!
Come on. Oh, boy! Come on.
[Guy] Hey! Don't open that! It's an alien planet!
Is there air? You don't know!
Seems okay.
Here we go.
[Jason] Which way, Alexander?
This way!
Wait. No.
That way.
-You were holding it upside down. -Shut up.
You know, with all that makeup and stuff, I thought you were smart for a second.
[Alexander] You think you could do better, Laredo?
-[Tommy] All right with that Laredo stuff. -[Guy] We're screwed. We're so screwed.
[Jason] Come on, come on, if we want to finish this mission,
we have to use some self-control.
[Gwen] Self-control? That's funny coming from a guy
who slept with every Terrakian slave girl and moon princess on the show.
Did it ever occur to you, had you been more supportive, we might have been able…
Wow. Must be some sort of mining facility.
Where are the miners?
-Something bad happened here. -Will you relax?
[Jason] There they are.
Beryllium spheres. Let's go.
Look at that. Would you look at that?
They look like little children.
Could they be the miners?
Sure, I mean, they're like, three years old.
Miners, not minors!
-You lost me. -I don't like this.
-I don't like this at all. -They are so cute.
Sure, they're cute now, but in a second, they're gonna get mean.
They're gonna get ugly somehow, then there's gonna be a million more of them.
[gasps] Look. There's a little hurt one.
-Hi. Hi there-- [screams] -[all] Shh!
Did you guys ever watch the show?
See? They're gonna help the little hurt one.
I'm so sick of being right.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills Guy.
Wait a minute! We're not going anywhere without a beryllium sphere.
We need a plan. Fred, I need a diversion to clear the compound of those things.
Then, Alex and Gwen and I will go get a sphere.
Tommy, get up on that ridge.
If you see them come back, give me a signal, all right?
Why does this sound so familiar? "Assault on Voltareck Three," episode 81.
-We're doing episode 81? -Whatever. The one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
Well, how the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
-Are we doing episode 81? -It's just a rough plan, Guy.
What difference does it make if it's episode 81 or not?
'Cause I died in episode 81.
Episode 51, right? Fifty-one. Fifty-one.
This is ludicrous. Why are you listening to this fellow?
May I remind you he's wearing a costume, not a uniform.
He's no more equipped to lead us than this fellow. No offense.
Look! They're gone.
-Where'd they go? Back inside? -I don't know.
Nobody was watching?
All right. Listen up. Here's the plan. Gwen, Fred, Alex and I will go down
and get a sphere. Fleegman, you set up a perimeter, and Tommy, you're lookout.
You see anything at all, you give us a signal, all right?
[Tommy] What kind of a signal?
Any kind of signal. Okay, I'll do my hands like this and I'll...
Caw! Caw! What are you, an infant? Look, we have these.
That-- Sorry.
Right, let's go.
-[Gwen] Does the rolling help actually? -It helps.
-Where's your gun? -It helps.
-Oh. -What?
Never give up. Never surrender.
-Oh, shut up. -Oh, shut up.
Caw! Caw! Jason! They're coming! There's thousands of them, Jason!
Run, Jason! Run! They're coming! They're everywhere!
-[Guy] They're everywhere! -Jason, they're everywhere!
-They're everywhere! -[Justin] Come on, let's go!
[Guy] They're coming!
[Jason] Hurry!
-[Tommy] They're everywhere! Come on! -[Guy] Oh, God! Oh, God!
[Jason] Don't look back. Do not look back!
-[Tommy] Oh, God. -[Guy] We're not gonna make it!
-[screams] -[Guy] Oh, God!
[Guy] I knew it, I knew it! I knew this was gonna kill me!
[Jason] Go, go, go! Come on. Push it, push it! Right. Let's go, Tommy!
I got it, but it's gonna take a few seconds.
I got it, I got it!
-Oh, yeah! -Go ahead. There's no time. Get in! Get in!
God, I'd forgotten, you've got to be the hero, haven't you?
Heaven forbid anybody else gets the spotlight! Oh, no! Jason Nesmith--
Jason! Jason, come on! Hurry!
-I'm on it! -Tommy, go! Go! I'm in!
No! No, no, no! Jason, please!
-Tommy, stop the pod! He's not in! -But I can't stop it, it's on autopilot!
-Go! Leave him! -No!
Oh, right!
Of course, it's always about you, isn't it?
[alien in foreign language] That's strange.
It looks like a child.
What should we do?
Hit it with a rock.
And we'll eat it!
-Gorignak! Gorignak! -Gorignak! Gorignak!
Jason? Jason, can you hear me?
[Jason] Yeah, Gwen, you got me.
-Thank God. Are you okay? -[Jason] Yeah.
As a matter of fact, I have a Gorignak staring me in the face right now.
But you know what? I think I can take him.
Jason, we're gonna use the digital conveyor to get you out of there.
-The digital conveyor? -[Gwen] Yes.
You mean I'm gonna be diced into cubes and sent up there in a million pieces?
-Right. -[Jason] Well, you know what?
I think I'll take my chance with Gorignak.
[Gwen] We're getting you out right now. It's perfectly safe, isn't it, Teb?
It has never been successfully tested.
-[Jason] What did he say? -Hold, please.
Theoretically, the mechanism is fully operational.
However, it was built to accommodate your anatomy, not ours.
But now that Tech Sergeant Chen is here, he can operate it.
It was designed watching his motions from the historical documents.
I-- I mean, I can't. I-- I can supervise…
-Jason, we're gonna test it. -On what?
How about that pig lizard?
Hey, I'm doin' all right with the pig lizard.
Please, Fred? And hurry.
I'm sorry. It's very exciting to watch the master at the controls.
The operation of the conveyor is much more... hmm... art than science.
Stand back, Jason.
What? What was that?
-Nothing. -I hear some squealing or something.
-Oh, no. Everything's fine. -But the animal is inside out.
I heard that. It turned inside out?
And it exploded.
Did I just hear that that animal turned inside out and then it exploded?
Hello?
Hold, please.
[Jason] Hey, wait a minute, guys, guys.
If the pig lizard is gone, why are they still yelling "Gorignak"?
Teb, hit the translation circuit.
-Rock, rock, rock, rock! -Rock, rock, rock, rock!
Jason, I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak.
What the hell are you talking about?
Oh, darn.
Digitize me!
-Come on, Fred. -[Jason] Come on, guys. Digitize me!
-Not me. -They based it on your hand movements.
Am I the only one who saw that thing inside out?
-No, no, no. -I'm not the guy.
I'm not Tech Sergeant Chen, I'm Fred Kwan.
I'm not even-- Kwan's not even my real name.
Fred's no good. You're just gonna have to kill it.
Kill it? Well, I'm open to any suggestions.
Go for the eyes, like in episode 22!
It doesn't have any eyes, Tommy.
Go for the mouth or the throat, its vulnerable spot!
It's a rock. It doesn't have any vulnerable spots!
I know! You construct a weapon. Look around you.
Can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?
A lathe! Get off the line, Guy!
Alexander, you're my advisor. Advise me!
Well, you're just gonna have to figure out what it wants. What is its motivation?
It's a damn rock monster. It doesn't have motivation.
See, that's your problem, Jason. You were never serious about the craft.
Fred, can you hear me? Fred, are you there? Ah!
[Fred] Kind of. [Jason] You can do it, Fred. It's up to you.
Oh, no, no. Jason, I'll just-- I'll just mess it up.
You did it for four years on the show. Do it now!
That was the show. I'm not that guy!
Fred, you never forgot a line. You never missed a mark.
-[groans] -That's not me anymore, man.
It is you, Fred. You just stopped trying.
You can do this, Fred! I know in my heart you're gonna save my life.
-I am? -No doubt about it, Fred.
Fred!
Fred, can you hear me?
Fred!
Fred? I don't want to die down here.
Digitize me, Fred!
Oh, wow.
-[Teb] Tech Sergeant Chen. -Yeah!
I see you managed to get your shirt off.
-I did it. -Welcome back, Fred.
All right. Did we get the beryllium sphere installed?
-Yes, we are back to full power. -Great! Engines and pods?
-Fully operational. -Perfect!
Well, crank this sucker up, you could drop us off, and you guys can be back in your home planet before supper.
Oh, no, Sir, we have no reason to go back.
-Sure you do! Family, friends. Come on. -We are all that is left.
-I didn't know that. -Sir, I have raised the command deck.
Mathesar, meet us up at the command deck.
Mathesar.
Mathesar! Quellek!
Teb, why can't we reach them?
Commander. Thank God you're alive.
Now you will face justice, Sarris.
At every turn, you demonstrate the necessity for your extermination.
Leave him alone.
You wish to save the life of this man?
Yeah. Yes.
Then tell me, what does it do, this Omega 13?
I-- I don't know what it does.
I said I don't know!
-Is it a bomb? -I don't know.
-[Sarris] A booby trap? -I don't know!
-Tell me! -I don't know!
[Sarris] Do you think I'm a fool?
That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld in his ship?
Prepare a tear harness…
for the female.
No! Gwen, no!
[Gwen] You brute! Let go of me!
I'm not the commander. -What did you say? -I said, "I'm not the Commander."
-What did you say? -I said, "I'm not the Commander."
[pants] Leave them alone. There's no reason to hurt them.
-They don't know anything. -Explain.
Gwen… show him the historical documents.
Computer, show the historical documents of the Galaxy Quest missions.
Wonderful.
You have all done far greater damage than I ever could have.
Bravo! [laughs]
Bravo.
This is a moment I will treasure.
Explain to him who you all really are.
Tell him!
Explain!
Mathesar… there's no such person as Captain Taggart.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I am, uh… an actor.
We're all actors.
He doesn't understand.
Explain as you would a child.
We, uh, we pretended.
We lied.
Yes! You understand that, don't you, Mathesar?
Mathesar, I'm not a commander. I…
There's no National Space Exploration Administration.
-We-- We don't have a ship. -But there it is.
That ship is that big.
But inside, I've seen many rooms.
You've seen plywood sets that look like the inside.
Our beryllium sphere is wire with plaster around it.
And our…
Our digital conveyor is…
It's Christmas tree lights. It's a decoration. It's all fake.
Just like me.
But why?
It's difficult to explain.
On our planet, we, uh…
We pretend to… to entertain and…
Mathesar, I am so sorry. God, I am so sorry.
[Sarris] So now you know.
Lieutenant Lathe, hardwire the reactor core to overload.
I would like to blow this troublesome vehicle to dust.
Sarris, what about my people?
Yes, far too simple a death for them, isn't it?
Lathe, open an oxygen seal on level C.
Let the air in a bit for our friends.
-Son of a-- [grunts] -[electricity crackles]
Release them… into space.
[computer] Core overload. Emergency shutdown overridden.
Core implosion estimated in nine minutes.
Core overload. Emergency shutdown overridden.
-Hey! -Core implosion estimated in nine minutes.
[Alexander] Where's the happy ending, Jason?
"Never give up. Never surrender."
Maybe it's about time you just backed off, you… you fin-headed monstrosity.
[Gwen] Jason.
You what?
You're starting to act like you did in episode 17,
you scene-stealing hack.
Oh, right!
Well, how does it feel, Jason? Was it worth it? You've murdered us all!
-Shut up. -Hundreds to die just because of you!
-I told you to shut up! -Both of you, get in there.
[Alexander] Hundreds to die, just because you want to play at being commander,
-you raving lunatic. -Then I'll see you in hell, won't I?
Look out, Jason!
Get his gun! Get the gun!
Take that!
Sorry-- The door's a little sticky. Did you see that?
I'll get one of my boys up here with a can of WD-40.
-You used to pull your punches. -Scene-stealing hack? Thank you.
Raving egomaniac?
-Wonder where I got that from? -Hey, guys.
Look.
They're suffocating.
[computer] Core overload. Emergency shutdown overridden.
Core implosion estimated in eight minutes.
General, your transport is ready for departure.
[computer] Core overload. Emergency shutdown overridden.
Core implosion estimated in seven minutes.
-Computer, shut down the core. -[computer] Unable.
Memory checksum invalid. Core systems hardware damaged.
All right, listen up. This is what we gotta do.
Gwen, you and I, we're gonna get to the core and shut it down manually.
Fred, take Guy and Laliari. You find that valve, shut it off,
before those Thermians run out of air.
Alexander, get to the barracks, see if you can't wedge a door open -in case they can't do that. -Okay.
Wait, Jason. What about me? What do I do?
You're gonna practice driving. Let's go!
Practice driving.
-So we get to shut down a neutron reactor? -That's right.
Well, I hate to break it to you, Jason, but…
I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor,
and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about,
I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, either.
No, I don't, but I know someone who does.
Brandon, honey, the garbage.
[groans] Mother, I'm quite busy.
[Mom] Come on, Brandon, don't make me ask you again.
[sighs] Just ten more minutes, okay, Ma? I promise.
-[vox continues to beep] -[Jason] Hello? Anybody there?
Hello?
-Hello? -Got him.
Listen to me. This is Jason Nesmith.
I play Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, of NSEA Protector.
We accidentally traded voxes the other day when we bumped into each other. Oh.
-Oh, Commander, I see. Okay. -[Jason] What's your name, son?
Brandon.
Brandon, I remember you. From the convention, right?
You asked all those little technical questions about the ship,
and I was a little short with you.
Yes, yes, I know, Commander, and I actually wanna…
Just wanted to tell you that I thought a lot about what you said…
-It's okay. Now, listen. -But-- But I want you to know
that I'm not a complete brain case, okay?
I understand completely that it's just a TV show.
Hold… Wait a minute. [Brandon] I know there's no beryllium sphere…
-Stop for a second. Stop… -[Brandon] …no digital conveyor, no ship.
-It's all real. -Oh, my God, I knew it.
I knew it! I knew it! [laughs]
The crew and I are in a lot of trouble, and we need your help.
[computer] Core overload. Emergency shutdown overridden.
Core implosion estimated in six minutes.
Sir, it's you. Thank Ipthar!
Quellek? What are you doing up there?
I avoided capture by using your Mak'Tar stealth haze.
Where is everyone?
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
All right, we're at level C, hallway five. Now what?
[Brandon] Go to weapons storage, your second left, through the passage.
Now, that leads to a system of utility corridors
-through the bowels of the ship. -Open.
[Brandon] You know what? I'm gonna get Kyle.
He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
Thirty-eight, 39, 40.
All right. All we have to do is turn off the valve to the barracks.
Hi, Brandon.
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency.
You've still got the utility systems walk-through, right?
Yeah, I've got sectors one through 28. I think Hollister has the upper levels.
[Brandon] Great, we'll get everybody online.
-Pedal to the metal, Commander. -Pedal to the metal, Commander.
General! I have just received word that the commander of the Protector
and his command crew have escaped custody.
What?
Find them!
But, Sir! My men…
-The core implosion is not reversible. -Find them!
All right, Brandon, I see five ducts in this room. Which way do we go?
Enter the passage second to your left, and just continue straight for 50 meters.
Ducts? Why is it always ducts?
-[Brandon] There will be a slight drop. -[Gwen screams]
Thanks for the heads-up, Brandon!
You okay?
[Quellek] They're dying.
Wait a minute. We gotta go across this thing?
-[Brandon] Yes. -Don't look down.
[Brandon] Commander, what I'd give to see what you're seeing.
[Jason] What are you talking about?
[Brandon] You're deep in the underbelly of the Omega 13!
Oh, it must be spectacular.
Well, it doesn't look like much to me.
Just these few walls and this dumb spinning fan
that we have in every single…
[Jason] Brandon, what does the Omega 13 device do?
[Brandon] Many have believed that it is a matter-collapser.
A bomb capable of destroying pretty much everything in about 13 seconds.
But myself and others are convinced that what it is is a matter-rearranger,
effecting a 13-second time jump to the past.
But why 13 seconds? That's really not enough time to do anything of any importance.
-It'd be time to redeem a single mistake. -What?
Come on! Go, go, go, go!
Fleeg, we gotta turn off that valve. Their oxygen's almost gone.
Listen, I'll go in. I'll create a distraction. I got this. I'm okay,
I might be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
That's suicide.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred. I'm a dead man, anyway.
If I'm gonna die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Guy, Guy, maybe you're the plucky comic relief.
Did you ever think about that?
-Plucky? -Well, besides…
[laughs] I just had this really interesting idea.
Are you stoned?
We've gotta get it open, give them some time.
Sir, perhaps together,
the Mak'Tar chant of strength, "Larak tarath."
-Larak tarath, larak tarath. -Larak tarath.
-Larak tarath, larak tarath, larak tarath! -Larak tarath, larak tarath, larak tarath!
All right, Brandon, we're across. Now what?
You want to take a left and then just straight on through the chompers.
"The chompers"?
-Well, screw that. -How are we supposed to get through this?
Hollister, do you have the sequence yet?
Okay, the sequence is 2242…
-What is this thing? -[Hollister] …2242…
I mean, it serves no useful purpose for there to be a bunch of chompy-crushy things -in the middle of a hallway! -[Jason] Gwen! Gwen!
No, I think we shouldn't have to do this.
It makes no logical sense! Why is it here?
-'Cause it's on the television show! -Well, forget it!
I am not doing it! This episode was badly written!
Okay, Commander, now, as soon as the first crusher hits…
It just did!
-Okay, go now. -Go!
-Go! -[Gwen screams]
[Brandon] Stop! Go!
[Jason] Come on, come on, come on!
[Brandon] Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
No, stop! Stop! Go!
Stop! Wait to jump!
[Brandon] I want you to jump, Commander, jump!
Whoever wrote this episode should die!
This should be interesting.
It's the simple things in life you treasure.
That's great.
Now, we better get…
[laughs] Hey, get a room, guys, okay?
[Guy] Hey, Fred.
Hey, Fred.
Oh, that's not right. No.
Sir, the pressure, it's normalizing.
Open!
We are saved. He has saved us!
Commander Taggart has saved us!
[all] Hooray, Commander Taggart!
It's just not fair.
All right, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck.
I'm-- I'm shot.
Quellek?
Well, it's not too bad.
We'll get you to the medical quarters and you'll be fine.
It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.
I have been blessed, Sir. I…
Don't speak, Quellek.
You'll forgive my impertinence, Sir, but even though we had never before met,
I always considered you as a father to me.
Quellek…
by Grabthar's hammer,
by the Sons of Warvan,
you shall be avenged.
[Gwen] Thirteen, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19!
All right, Brandon, I'm here. How do I shut this thing down?
[Brandon] Okay, just push the blue button.
-The blue button? Is that it? -Yeah, why, what's wrong?
Nothing, I just thought it'd be more complicated than that.
[computer] Core implosion estimated in 20 seconds.
Brandon, it's not working. Brandon!
Mother, I cannot stress enough the severity
-of the commander's predicament. -[Mom] Don't forget the recyclables!
[computer] Core implosion estimated in ten seconds.
-Nine, eight… -Gwen, I…
-[computer] …seven, six… -I've always…
-[computer] …five, four… -Jason, Jason.
[computer] …three, two, one.
It always stops at one on the show.
-[Jason laughs] -What were you saying?
-Sir! -What?
The core detonation sequence on the Protector has been aborted.
Impossible! Impossible!
Lock a complement of implosion missiles onto the Protector.
Tear her apart!
He's finished, he's finished. Alexander, listen to me.
It's okay, it's okay.
The Thermians can handle it from here. We gotta go. Come on.
We need that armor back up!
-Get me a forward view right now! -Plasma armor engaged.
All right, Tommy, see if you can't lose them in that minefield.
-In that minefield? -Pedal to the metal, right now!
-Pedal to the metal! -All right, let's go!
Good going, Tommy. Great going.
[Sarris] Thrust ahead, full!
Into the field, go!
[Jason] Tommy, can you get us closer to these mines?
Closer?
I could try.
General, I've lost them.
The magnetism of the minefield is disrupting our instruments.
Wait! I see something.
Yes. Yes! There they are.
-Get back on their tail. -[Lathe] I can't, Sir.
-What? Why not? -Because they're coming right at us.
[Sarris] Fire at will.
[whoops] We're getting hammered, Jason! Return fire?
-No! Divert all energy to the armor! -How adorable!
The actors are going to play war with me.
Sarris' ship accelerating toward us at mach two.
Accelerate to mach four.
Let me remind you, sonny,
I am a general.
If you are counting on me to blink, then you are making a deadly mistake.
Well, let me tell you something, Sarris.
It doesn't take a great actor to recognize a bad one.
You're sweating!
Armor almost gone, Jason!
You fool! You fail to realize that with your armor gone,
my ship will tear through yours like tissue paper.
And what you fail to realize is my ship is dragging mines.
Oh, no! Turn, turn!
-Yes! -Yes! [whoops]
Yes! Yes! Yes!
This is fantastic!
Mathesar!
Oh, my God, you're alive.
Come here.
"The ship was a model as big as this."
A very clever deception indeed.
-Set a course for home, Commander? -Can you do that?
Yeah, it's just point and click.
But we're gonna have to go through the black hole, though.
Any objections?
[chuckles] All right. Set her up.
What's the matter, Mathesar?
We were hoping you could come with us.
My people have no commander.
Mathesar, I think your people have a great commander…
Sir.
All right, Tommy, take us into the black hole.
-We're out! -We're going home!
-[computer] Systems register functional. -All systems are working, Commander.
Jason, before the black hole, there was an energy surge from Sarris' ship.
Let's not worry about that right now, Alexander.
Fred, what are you doing up here? Shouldn't you be downstairs until we--
Hey, you know, you could put an eye out with that thing.
Fred?
No!
Mathesar!
Activate the Omega 13!
-We're out! -We're going home!
-[computer] Systems register functional. -All systems are working, Commander.
Jason, before the black hole,
there was an energy surge from Sarris' ship.
-[grunts] -[Gwen] Jason, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Let go of me. Let-- It's not Fred!
That's Sarris. Listen to me! I'm telling you, it's not Fred, that's Sarris!
-He's gonna try to kill all of us! -[screams]
Never give up. Never surrender.
Jason! Jason! I can't slow it down!
[Mathesar] Our ship is too big to enter the atmosphere.
We need to separate, or we'll die.
We gotta do it. It's our only hope, Mathesar. Thank you.
Crew to the secondary deck.
Mathesar!
Goodbye, my friends.
Fred, get up to command deck. We're separating.
On, Teb, on!
[reporter] This is the third day of the Galaxy Con,
and Jason Nesmith and his entire crew are no-shows here at the big event,
much to the disappointment of all these fans…
-Bye. Be back soon! -Wait. Brandon. Where are you going -with all those fireworks? -Well…
the Protector got super-accelerated coming out of the black hole,
and it's, like, nailed the atmosphere at mach 15,
which, you guys know, is pretty unstable, obviously,
so we're gonna help Laredo guide it on the vox ultra-frequency carrier
and use Roman candles for visual confirmation.
All right, dinner's at 7:00.
Well, he's outside.
Lieutenant Laredo, Tommy Webber!
Hi, Tommy!
The beautiful Tawny Madison, Gwen DeMarco!
Yes!
Yes!
Wow, what effects!
Another shipmate! Yes, the more, the merrier!
The ship's Tech Sergeant Chen, Fred Kwan, and a friend.
-Dr. Lazarus, Alexander Dane! -[eerie music playing]
[announcer] Give him a big hand. He's British! Yes, Sir!
Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, Jason Nesmith!
Great driving, Tommy.
Yes! Yes!
[Jason] Quick, quick, quick! Go, go! Move, move!
[announcer] Once again, Commander Peter Quincy Taggart,
Mr. Jason Nesmith!
Come on! Give it up for the crew, the NSEA Protector!
True love! Yes!
Come on!
They're here for you, folks. Give it up!
What a show!
What a show! Yes!
Yes! Give it up! Wow!
Come on, give it up!
Give it all up for the crew of your favorite show, Galaxy Quest! Wow!
Come on, come on!
[announcer] Don't forget to buy a Galaxy Quest T-shirt on your way out. Thank you.
[narrator] And now, back again after 18 years,
where, from ages long past, dwelt the spirits of the gods.
Yakul!
Ashitaka!
The wise woman wants everybody back to the village at once.
We just came from Ji-san. Ji-san?
Yes, in the forest. Something's wrong. -The birds have gone. -The animals too.
-The birds have gone. -The animals too.
I'll go check with Ji-san. You three hurry back home.
Something's there.
Ji-san, did you see it too? I did. It isn't human.
The wise woman's calling everybody back to the village.
There. Look.
It's some kind of demon! A demon?
Run, Yakul!
It's headed for the village. I've got to stop it.
Ashitaka! That thing is cursed! Don't let it touch you!
That thing is cursed! Don't let it touch you!
Yakul!
Calm your fury, O mighty Lord!
Whatever you may be, god or demon, please leave us in peace!
-The monster! -Come on!
Go back! Leave our village alone!
Stop! Please!
Get up!
-He killed it! -Ashitaka!
-Fetch the wise woman! -Don't put the fire out yet.
Ashitaka!
Kaya, don't touch it. This wound is evil.
Ashitaka is hurt! Where is the wise woman?
You must keep away from him, all of you. Everyone, stay back.
What shall we do?
Take this and pour it over his wound, child, slowly.
All right.
O nameless god of rage and hate,
I bow before you.
Where you have fallen we will raise a mound and perform rites.
Pass on in peace and bear us no hatred.
Disgusting little creatures,
soon all of you will feel my hate and suffer as I have suffered.
I'm afraid this is very bad.
The stones tell me the boar god came from far to the west.
He had some kind of poison inside him, driving him mad, a poisonous hatred
that consumed his heart and flesh... and turned him into a demon monster.
Prince Ashitaka? Yes?
Show everyone your right arm.
Hii-sama!
My prince, are you prepared to learn what fate the stones have foretold you?
Yes, I was prepared the very moment that I let my arrow fly.
The infection will spread, cause you great pain and kill you.
Is there no way we can stop it?
The prince got that wound by defending our village and saving our lives!
Do we just sit here and watch him die?
You cannot alter your fate, my prince.
However, you can rise to meet it, if you choose.
Look at this.
This iron ball was found in the boar's body.
It shattered his bones and burned its way deep inside him.
This is what turned him into a demon.
There is evil at work in the land to the west, Prince Ashitaka.
It's your fate to go there and see what you can see with eyes unclouded by hate.
You may find a way to lift the curse. You understand?
Yes.
We are the last of the Emishi. It's 500 years since the emperor destroyed our tribe...
It's 500 years since the emperor destroyed our tribe...
and drove the remnants of our people to the east.
Some managed to survive here for all these years,
but our tribe's blood has grown thinner and weaker with each generation.
Now our last prince must cut his hair and leave us, never to return?
Sometimes I think the gods are laughing at us.
Our laws forbid us from watching you go, Ashitaka. Farewell.
Ashitaka! Kaya, what are you doing here? You know it's forbidden.
Do you think I care about that?
I came to give you this so you won't forget your little sister.
Your crystal dagger. Kaya, I can't take this.
Please, keep it with you, brother, to protect you.
Please, I want you to have it, so you won't... forget.
Kaya, you know I could never forget you.
A battle?
Move in!
Look! Up there, on the hill!
His head is mine!
Stop!
My arm! What's happening to me?
Hurry! Stop him before he gets away!
Let me pass! I'm warning you!
A demon.
The mark is getting bigger.
Are you selling soup or donkey piss?
There he is now.
Will this be enough?
What are you trying to pull? This isn't money.
Give me back my rice, you little thief.
Excuse me, but might I inspect that?
But this is a lump of pure gold, you silly woman!
If it's money you want, I'll pay for the rice and take this nugget off your hands.
My good people, is there a money changer who could tell us how much this is worth?
No? All right.
Now, I'm just a monk, but I'd say three bags of rice at least. That's right, maybe even more.
Hey, wait a minute.
Give me my gold!
Hey! You can't just rush off now.
Don't you even think of thanking me. It was my pleasure.
In fact, I should be thanking you, really.
You see, I was caught in that battle. I saw what you did to those samurai.
You fight like a demon. Where'd you learn to fight like that?
I see you noticed we're being followed. That's what we get for waving gold.
They'll wait till we're asleep, then slit our throats.
What do you say we give 'em a little demonstration of how fast we can run?
So the demon monster turned out to be a giant boar.
I followed its trail westward through the mountains, but then--
You lost it. That's life. See this place here?
When I came here last, a few years back, this was a lovely little village.
But then there must have been a flood or a landslide. Everybody's dead.
These days, there are angry ghosts all around us,
dead from wars, sickness, starvation. And nobody cares.
So you say you're under a curse? So what? So's the whole damn world.
Ah, this is good!
I was wrong to fight in that village. Two men are dead because of me.
Samurai thugs. You win some, you lose some.
Hand me your bowl.
My point is, everybody dies.
Some now, some later.
Beautiful bowl. I've seen one other like it.
Have you ever heard of the Emishi people?
They're said to ride red elks.
They also use stone arrowheads just like you.
Of course, they were all wiped out 500 years ago.
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone where you're from.
Anyway, I've got much bigger fish to fry.
Have you ever come across anything like this before?
Never have.
It was inside the giant boar. I'm sure it was that ball that killed him.
There's a place high in the mountains far to the west of here.
It's where the Forest Spirit dwells, ‎and it's very dangerous for humans.
To enter there is certain death. The Forest Spirit?
I've been told the beasts there are all giants, just as they were in the dawn of time.
See ya there, my friend.
The sooner we get this rice home, the sooner we eat. Let's move!
Coming this way!
Wolves!
Don't let the oxen panic! Stay calm! Take up your positions!
Keep your powder dry.
Make sure you wait for them to come within range!
Ready! And fire!
Second round! Fire!
That was it? They weren't so big.
They're just pups. Wait till you see their mother.
It's Moro!
Come on.
We killed her!
You forget she is a god. It will take more than that.
She certainly did some damage. We move out now.
What about the men she pushed over the cliff? They're dead. Let's get the living home.
He's still breathing.
Hang on.
My name is Ashitaka! I have travelled far from lands to the east.
Are you ancient gods, and have I come to the realm of the Forest Spirit?
Go away.
A kodama! I never thought I'd see one of them here.
Easy there. You don't want to make your injuries worse, do you?
He's a tree spirit. He brings good luck. It's a sign this forest is healthy.
But they'll lead their lord and master right to us.
Who do you mean? Those wolves I just saw?
No, I mean a real monster, like a huge enormous deer.
Where did it go?
If Yakul's not afraid, then we have nothing to worry about here.
Would you be kind enough to grant us passage through your forest, little one?
Sir, I really think we should turn around now.
No humans have ever made it through these woods alive. There's a lovely trail back across the river.
The current's too swift for us to get across,
and your friend's injuries are very bad.
Hey, little fellow, are you showing us the way or just getting us more lost?
Please, sir, I'm really pretty sure they're not trying to help us get home. My God! There's thousands of them.
Look at that. That must be their mother, a fine old tree.
The tracks of those wolves and the girl with them. This place must be where the four of them live.
Sir, I think we took a wrong turn. This is a place for gods and demons.
I think we're safe. We'll rest a bit.
More tracks?
Whatever made these made them recently.
Sir! What's going on?
What just happened there? You went white as a sheet all of a sudden.
Here.
Did you see anything just then?
-Like what? -Forget it.
Hang on just a little longer. You're almost home.
Thank you.
It's gone,
That's strange. Suddenly he doesn't feel heavy at all.
My arm! It doesn't hurt!
It's healed! No, it's still broken.
Sir, you were right. We made it back home just like you said!
It's a fortress.
It's Lady Eboshi's Irontown.
We make iron here from the ore in the sand.
-Someone's come out of the woods. -Is it the Wolf Girl?
Look! It's me! Kohroku, the ox driver!
It's true! Kohroku's still alive!
Let's go see!
I'm trying to tally these accounts here, so shut up!
Haven't you heard? Kohroku's come back from the dead!
What?
This is unbelievable.
-Where are the others, Kohroku? -Yes, is my son with you?
I'm afraid we're the only ones who made it.
It's never the guards that die.
Stand aside.
That man in the weird costume, sir? Who do you think it could be?
He's obviously an outsider.
This stranger saved our lives. He carried the rifleman all the way back here.
You should be grateful to him.
Hey, watch the arm.
Sir. Hold it right there.
I'm very grateful for you bringing these men back to us, stranger,
but something doesn't smell right.
You got back almost as fast as we did
and through the forbidden forest with two badly injured men
and through the forbidden forest with two badly injured men -and you want me to believe-- -Kohroku! You're alive!
Toki!
That's just great!
How are you gonna drive the ox now, all banged up and mangled?
But...
You scared me half to death. I wish the wolves had eaten you.
Then maybe I could have found a real husband!
Sweetness, can we discuss this later?
Toki, save your sweet nothings for some other time.
And as for you, Gonza, a fine captain of the guard you are,
always strutting and throwing your weight around once the danger's over.
You never do a lick of work around here.
That's unfair and untrue.
Thanks, stranger. My husband's an idiot, but I'm glad he's safe and sound.
Oh, good. I was starting to think I'd done something wrong by bringing him back home.
Say, why don't you take the mask off? I bet you're really handsome.
Gonza?
Bring the stranger to me later. I would like to thank him personally.
Kohroku.
I'm happy you're back, and I apologize.
Milady, you really shouldn't tell him things like that. If you're too nice to him, he'll walk all over you.
I hope you'll forgive me, too, Toki. I was responsible. I should never have let it happen.
That's all right. Milady, if you hadn't been there, the wolves would have eaten everyone.
the wolves would have eaten everyone.
Get some rest, traveller. I will see you this evening.
Hey! You're not handsome, you're gorgeous!
Here! You know, they had to fight off wolves to get this rice through.
Just dish it out!
There he is!
Where is he?
Toki was right.
-He is handsome. -But he's so young!
That never stopped you before.
Quiet out there! We lost some good men today.
Yeah, there's lots of gorgeous men in here, honey!
I've seen cattle that looked better.
Listen, stranger, come over to our place? You don't want to stay in this old barn.
Look, woman! We risked our lives to bring you the rice, so watch your mouth.
And who made the iron that paid for that rice? Tell me that.
Yeah, we're pumping those bellows while you pigs are in bed.
Actually, if it's not too much trouble, I would like to see where you work.
You would? We'll have to work in make-up tonight.
Lend me your lipstick.
-Don't forget now. -We'll be waiting for you.
It's best not to pay them any mind, you know.
Lady Eboshi spoils them rotten. That's why they're like that.
They say that happy women make a happy village.
Happy? Ha! Those kind of women workin' here?
Women like that--It's a disgrace. They defile the iron.
Lady Eboshi goes around buying the contract of every brothel girl she can find.
Milady has a kind heart, that's all.
You got rice on your chin, old man.
It's true. Everything here has turned upside-down since she showed up.
That's right. She's not even afraid of the gods, that woman.
You should have seen the way she dealt with Nago. Am I right?
Who's Nago?
"Who's Nago?" The gigantic boar god. He used to rule this whole forest.
We couldn't even get near the mountains with him around.
Nothing to do but sit around on our backsides for months.
See, the iron in the sand under this town had all been dug out.
Then we tried to get at the iron under the mountain,
but Nago wasn't gonna stand for that.
Before we could dig for the iron, we had to clear away the forest,
and that's what made the boar angry.
He's feeling no pain.
Then one day Lady Eboshi came along with her warriors and her rifles.
Young man, what's wrong?
Is something hurting your arm?
No, I was just thinking about the boar god.
I was thinking how he must have died filled with hate.
Forgive me for keeping you waiting, stranger.
That's good iron.
We were running behind with tomorrow's shipment.
Let's have a rest. You may tell the others.
Some think you're a spy for the Wolf Girl or for Lord Asano and his samurai.
There are a lot of people out there with their eyes on this iron.
Why are you here, if you don't mind my asking?
I believe you'll recognize this.
It shattered the bones of a giant boar,
rotted his flesh and turned him into a monster.
I fought with him, and for that I was cursed with this mark on my arm,
and soon it will kill me.
Where is it you come from? I've never seen a red elk like that before.
I have come a very long way. I can't tell you more than that.
Answer milady's question or I'll cut you in half!
What do you plan to do? What exactly are you here for?
To see with eyes unclouded by hate.
"Eyes unclouded"?
That explains it.
Come. I'll show you all my secrets.
Is that wise, milady? Gonza, take over for me.
This is my garden. None of the townspeople dare to come here.
Follow me if you wish to learn my secret.
We've only just finished it, milady.
It's still too heavy.
Perhaps if you didn't hold it so delicately?
Milady, if we make them any lighter, they'll fall apart.
They're not for me. They're for the other women here.
That'll be something to see.
This is the latest rifle that I've asked these people to design.
The ones we brought here have turned out to be too heavy.
These will kill forest monsters and pierce the thickest samurai armour.
You better watch out there, young man. Lady Eboshi wants to rule the world.
I'm sorry to have to push you all so hard. I'll have wine sent down later.
That'll be nice.
First you transform the boar into a demon. Now you're making even deadlier weapons!
How much more hatred and pain do you think we need?
Yes, I'm the one who shot the boar,
and I'm sorry that you suffer. I truly am.
That brainless pig. I'm the one he should have put a curse on, not you.
Does that right hand of yours wish to kill me now, Ashitaka?
If it would lift the curse, I'd let it tear you apart,
but even that wouldn't end the killing now, would it?
No, it wouldn't. It would have to kill all of us to be at peace.
Milady, Osa has something to say.
Forgive me, milady. You must not make light of the boy's strength.
Young man, like you, I know what rage feels like...
and grief and helplessness.
But you must not take your revenge on Lady Eboshi.
She is the only one who saw us as human beings. We are lepers.
The world hates and fears us,
but she took us in and washed our rotting flesh and bandaged us.
Osa?
Life is suffering. It is hard.
The world is cursed, but still, you find reasons to keep living.
I'm sorry. I'm making no sense.
They just keep coming back.
Every night they're out there planting trees,
trying to turn the mountain into a forest again.
Stay here. Help me kill the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka.
You would do that? Kill the very heart of the forest?
Without that ancient god, the animals here would be nothing but dumb beasts once more.
When the forest has been cleared and the wolves wiped out,
this desolate place will be the richest land in the world,
and Princess Mononoke will become human.
Princess Mononoke?
Princess of the spirits of ghouls, beasts and ancient gods.
The wolf stole her soul, and now she lives to kill me.
The legends say the blood of the Great Forest's Spirit can heal anything.
Perhaps it could cure my poor lepers. Might even be able to lift your curse.
Milady! How does the action feel to you?
Smooth as silk, the perfect thing for ruling the world.
It's still too heavy for the girls.
All right.
Well, look who's here.
Evening. All right if I work the bellows for a while? Well, I guess so.
Excuse me. May I try it?
It's okay. Might as well let him try.
When you get tired, I'll take over for you.
Well, that won't be long.
Better keep that kimono shut tight, girl.
I'm impressed, but you'll never keep that pace up.
It's hard work, isn't it?
You bet, and our shifts are four days long.
You must lead hard lives here.
Yeah, I suppose. But it sure beats working a brothel in the city?
Here we get to eat as much as we want, and the men don't bother us!
I see.
-No! -But you can't leave tomorrow. Can't you stay a little longer?
You can stay and work here.
Thanks, but there's someone I have to find out there in the forest.
She's here.
The wolves are coming.
Stop!
Wait! I don't want to fight you. I'm a friend.
Hurry! She's after Lady Eboshi!
Somebody cut her off!
Keep stoking those fires!
Riflemen to the stockade. We've got her right where we want her.
A weapon for every man! Everyone defends Irontown!
Toki, she's on the roof.
Now, don't get excited. Keep those bellows working.
Whatever happens, we can't let those fires go out.
-Is she alone? -Yes. We have her cornered.
You know she means to kill you this time.
We'll see about that. Come on.
Can you hear me, Princess of Beasts? If it's me you want, here I am.
If you seek revenge for all the animals we've killed,
well, there are two women down here whom I'd like you to meet.
They want revenge for husbands killed by your wolves.
Come on out, you little witch! My husband's dead because of you!
There she is!
Everybody out of the way! Riflemen, get ready to fire!
It's a trap. No! Wait!
Princess of the wolf gods! Don't go down there! Go back to the forest!
Don't throw your life away!
Shall I stop him? Leave him be. Let him do what he likes.
She's down! We got her!
Stay back.
Cut off a wolf's head, and it still has the power to bite.
-Take aim where she falls. -Right.
Open fire.
Stay back!
Wake up.
No!
-Skin her! -Kill her, milady! Kill her!
-Skin her! -Kill her, milady! Kill her! Kill her!
Are you all right, sir? Can I help you?
Get away from me! Begone!
Traitor! You're a spy for the wolves, aren't you?
Stay back!
Step aside.
What do you think you're doing, boy?
The girl's life is now mine.
I'm sure she'll make a lovely wife for you.
There's a demon inside of you. It's inside both of you.
Look, everyone!
This is what hatred looks like. This is what it does when it catches hold of you.
It's eating me alive, and very soon now it will kill me!
Fear and anger only make it grow faster.
I'm getting a little bored of this curse of yours, Ashitaka.
Let me just cut the damn thing off!
Lady Eboshi!
Someone come here and take her from me.
Milady!
Don't worry. She's just stunned. She'll be all right.
As for me, I'm leaving, and I'm taking the Wolf Girl!
No, you're not! Nobody treats my Lady Eboshi like that!
Move and I fire!
Kiyo, what are you doing?
How can he still be walking?
-Is she all right? -Yes, milady's safe, sir.
Someone bring me my gun! Riflemen to the square now, on the double!
They're not getting out of here alive!
Toki, come here.
What? What's happened?
Sir, I can't let you pass.
The gate's been ordered shut. It can't be opened.
Turn back, please.
We're grateful. You brought those men back to us. We don't want to hurt you.
Please!
I walked in through this gate this morning. Now I'm going to leave the same way.
Don't be a fool. It takes ten men to open this gate.
Stop it! You'll kill yourself.
It's opening.
Out of the way!
The wolves are attacking!
Flint!
She's all right! Your princess is safe with me!
Stay and I will bring her!
Come on, Yakul.
You have my thanks.
Good luck, stranger.
Stop it!
Leave him! He's mine!
His own people shot him. He's dying.
Why did you stop me from killing her? Tell me while you're still alive.
I didn't want them to kill you. That's why.
I'm not afraid to die. I'd do anything to get you humans out of my forest.
I knew that from the first moment I saw you.
And I'm not afraid of you! I should kill you for saving her!
That woman is evil. There's no one who can stop me from killing her.
No. Live.
That's enough! I'm not listening to you anymore!
You're beautiful.
What is it, San? Want me to crunch his face off?
The ape tribe.
Apes, how dare you show such disrespect to the wolf clan.
This is our forest.
The human, give him to us.
Give us the human and go.
You go before my fangs find you.
We will not go.
We will eat the human.
We will eat the human.
Yes, let us eat the man creature.
Are you crazy? Just what happened to make the ape tribe change this way?
Since when do apes eat the flesh of a man?
If we eat the human, we will steal his strength,
and we will drive the other humans away. Give us the man creature.
Stop this. You know you can't possess the humans' strength by eating them.
All that'll do is make you into something else, something even worse than human.
We plant trees. Humans tear them up.
The forest does not come back.
If we kill the humans, we will save the forest.
You mustn't give up. We'll find a way. The Forest Spirit is with us.
Keep planting trees and someday we'll beat them.
The Forest Spirit will not fight. We will all die.
Wolf Girl does not care. She is human.
Enough! I'll bite your head off, you chattering ape.
Stop!
Don't worry about them. It's all right.
You two go on ahead now. I'll stay here and deal with the human.
What about the elk? Can we eat him?
No, you may not. Go home!
Come over here. Don't worry. I'm a friend.
Don't be shy. I won't hurt you. I need you to help me carry him.
You're very wise. You know better than to set foot on this island, huh?
I smell like a human.
You can go wherever you want to. You're free now.
There he is. Come and see. Hurry.
It's the Nightwalker.
Quick, you idiots.
He's the reason we've been sitting around in these stinking animal skins, you know.
But sir, we can't. It's a sin to look at it.
And you call yourself the greatest hunter in the West.
Look. We've got a letter of pardon from the emperor,
forgiving us for cutting off the head of the Great Forest Spirit.
The legends tell us that when day becomes night,
the Forest Spirit turns into the Nightwalker,
and at sunrise, it changes back.
Look! See there? It's happening.
Take a look, Master Jigo. What is it?
Over there.
Look. There must be hundreds of them.
Those boars are not from this region.
They must've been traveling for months to get here.
That one's Okkoto!
Can't be. They say he died 100 years ago.
It's him, all right. I know those old tusks.
It's him, all right. I know those old tusks. And it looks like he brought along his whole tribe.
He's seen us! Let's get out of here!
Come on, you cowards! Move! Quickly!
The bullet wound's gone.
Yakul.
You're awake. You should thank Yakul. He hasn't left your side this whole time.
How'd you know his name's Yakul?
He told me, and he told me about you--
about your village, your people and your forest.
The Forest Spirit brought you back to life again. He wants you to live.
I had the strangest dream. There was a golden creature.
Eat this.
Chew.
We are here to kill the humans and save the forest.
Why are there humans here, Moro?
Humans are everywhere these days.
Go back to your own mountain. Kill them there. The girl is San, my daughter.
We will kill them here. We will save this forest.
What is that other human doing here?
He was shot, and then the Great Spirit healed his wound.
This man is not our enemy!
The Forest Spirit saved him? Saved the life of that loathsome runt?
Why didn't he save Nago?
Is he not the guardian of the forest? Why?
The Forest Spirit gives life and takes life away.
Life and death are his alone, or have you boars forgotten that?
You lie! You must have begged the Forest Spirit to spare his life!
But you did not beg for Nago, did you?
Nago was afraid to die. Now I, too,
carry within my breast a poisoned human bullet.
Nago fled, and the darkness took him. I remain and contemplate my death.
Mother! Please ask the Forest Spirit to save you.
I have lived long enough, San.
Soon the Forest Spirit will let me rest forever.
All these years you defended the Forest Spirit! He must save you!
You are not fooling us.
Nago was beautiful and strong. He would not have run from anything.
You wolves must have eaten him!
Quiet! Watch what you say, you filthy pig!
Gods of the mountain, please listen to me.
Nago died far from here, and I was the one who killed him.
He had become some kind of demon. One day he attacked our village.
If you want proof, look at my hand where he touched me.
I came here to beg the Forest Spirit to lift Nago's curse from me.
He healed the bullet wound in my side, but the demon mark remains.
First it will tear my soul apart, and then it will kill me.
Okkoto, finally, a boar who will listen to reason.
No, Lord Okkoto, wait!
Please, you mustn't eat him.
You are Moro's human child, aren't you? I have heard of you.
You're blind.
Stand back. I will not eat him.
It's all right, San.
My Lord Okkoto, what I said about Nago's death was the truth.
I believe you, and I thank you for it, young one.
I am only grieved and ashamed that a demon has come from our tribe.
O mighty Lord, is there a way to lift Nago's curse from me?
Leave this forest... for the next time we meet I will have to kill you.
You cannot win against the humans. Their guns will destroy you all.
Look on my tribe, Moro. We grow small, and we grow stupid.
We will soon be nothing but squealing game that the humans hunt for their meat.
that the humans hunt for their meat.
You'd risk everything on one last battle? That's just what the humans want.
I do not ask for the help of the wolf tribe.
Even if every one of us dies, it will be a battle the humans will never forget.
The Forest Spirit.
Come on! Keep your oxen together! Hurry!
Get ready now. Little bit closer.
Fire!
Reload! Fire!
Ready--
Well, I see somebody is going to have to go play the peacemaker.
Take our riflemen and hide behind the cliffs.
-There they are! -Where?
The hunters are ready, sir. Excellent. Well done, my boy.
Go and spread the word. We'll be moving out presently.
Greetings, Jigo.
I've got the emperor breathing down my neck,
and you're busy playing war with Lord Asano.
And you'd have nothing to do with him being here, now, would you?
Of course not. Whatever made you think that?
He'll call a truce if I give him half my iron.
Is that right? Well, he's a greedy bastard, isn't he?
But all the same, you might as well let him have his iron.
Listen, the boars are gathering for battle. You know what that means.
You made a promise. Get me the head of the Forest Spirit,
then we can come back and destroy Lord Asano together.
Watch out, milady! There's a horseman coming! Get in!
Well, speak of the devil, a messenger from Lord Asano.
We have guests. Mind your manners, ladies. Yes, ma'am.
Welcome back, milady!
Whoa! Wait! Won't you even talk to the man?
Lady Eboshi, mistress of Irontown! I bring a message to you from my Lord Asano.
You have fought valiantly and well. Now, open your gates that we may speak with you.
Hmph! We can hear you just fine from down there.
Milady took this mountain away from the gods, the boars and beasts!
And now that it's worth something, you want it!
Well, you won't get it!
You ladies need to be taught some respect!
Respect? What's that?
We haven't had any respect since the day we were born!
You want some of our iron? Here ya go!
They are really something.
They'll fight forest gods or samurai. It doesn't matter to them.
They're an amazing bunch, your girls. They were wasted in the brothels.
Impressive for a piece of paper.
Well, you know, it's gotten me all the best hunters and trappers around.
Remember, my dear lady, we're after a god, not just a beast.
Yes, milady, what is it?
Do you have any idea who this paper has come from?
From the emperor himself.
-The emperor? -Who's he?
-The Mikado. -The Mikado?
Okay, you got me there.
-Thank you. -Yes, milady.
Every day that we cut trees and dig for iron, the forest and its creatures grow weaker.
My way, there is no loss of life, Jigo.
Listen, you owe me and I've come to collect.
When you needed riflemen, I sent them, and without them, you lose Irontown.
I'm sorry. Did that sound like a threat?
Don't tell me the emperor believes... that wives' tale about the Great Spirit's head granting immortality.
I'm sure I don't know what the emperor believes. I'm just a humble monk.
I'm just trying to get by.
I keep my promises.
We have fought the boars before. They're easier to kill than Moro and her cubs.
So you can call out that shady bunch you've got hidden under the cliff, Jigo.
So I've been found out.
Just one more thing, milady.
Did a stranger come through here, by any chance?
He's a young man riding a great big red elk.
Came and went.
A bad-looking bunch, if you ask me.
Those men are no ordinary hunters. -They're killers. -Killers?
-They're killers. -Killers?
Milady, at least let some of us go with you.
Yes, you can't trust these men. They're strangers.
What if it goes wrong and we're stuck here? We can't help you.
You said yourself we're better shots than the men are.
That's precisely why I want you all here in Irontown.
I can deal with forest gods. It's humans I'm worried about.
Once the Forest Spirit is dead, we don't know what will happen.
Will Jigo be satisfied with the creature's head or will he be after my ironworks as well?
Jigo's riflemen may turn on us. If that happens, I'll need every one of you here to fight them.
Remember, you can't trust men.
Don't worry about her ladyship. I'll be right at her side, protecting her.
-That's what we're afraid of. -What?
Even if you were a woman, you'd still be an idiot!
Do you suffer?
You know, you could always jump, boy. End it all.
As soon as your strength returns, the mark will spread and destroy you.
It feels like I must've been asleep for weeks.
I had a dream that San was by my side, nursing me.
I was hoping you'd cry out in your sleep. Then I would have bitten your head off to silence you.
Then I would have bitten your head off to silence you.
It's a beautiful forest.
Are Okkoto and the boars on the move yet?
Yes, the boars are marching.
The trees cry out as they die, but you cannot hear them.
I listen to the forest's pain and feel the ache of the bullet in my chest,
and I dream of the day
when I will finally crunch that gun woman's head in my jaws.
Moro, why can't the humans and the forest live together?
Why can't we stop this fighting now?
The humans are gathering for the final battle.
The flames of their guns will burn us all.
And what happens to San? What's your plan, to let her die with you?
Typical. Selfish. You think like a human.
San is my daughter. She is of the wolf tribe.
When the forest dies, so does she.
You must set her free! She's not a wolf! She's human!
Silence, boy.
How dare you speak to a god like that?
I caught her human parents defiling my forest.
They threw their baby at my feet as they ran away.
Instead of eating her, I raised her as my own.
Now, my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter is neither human nor wolf.
How could you help her?
I don't know, but at least we might find a way to live.
How? Will you join forces with San and fight the humans?
No. All that would do is cause more hatred.
There is nothing you can do, boy.
Soon the demon mark will spread and kill you.
Leave this place at sunrise. Return and I shall kill you.
You're feeling all right?
I'm fine, thanks to you and the Forest Spirit.
Yakul, sorry if I worried you.
I guess my legs are still pretty weak?
It's so quiet. I wonder where the little kodama went.
I can smell the ironworks.
Thanks for showing us the way! I have another favour to ask!
Will you please give this to San for me?
Let's go.
It stinks, and it burns my eyes.
That's what they want. They're trying to kill our sense of smell.
It's that damn woman again.
She knows we're out here.
-It's a trap and a stupid one. -What?
They're trying to lure the boars out of the forest.
The humans are planning something.
Then we have to find Okkoto while there's still time to stop him
or they'll be killed!
Okkoto is too stubborn. He won't listen. None of them will.
They may even know it's a trap.
The boars are a proud race.
The last one left alive will still be charging blindly forward.
Why chop the trees down?
To make them angry, which makes them stupid.
Mother, I have to go. Okkoto's blind.
I must be his eyes.
You understand?
Do as you must.
You know that boy wanted to share his life with you.
I hate him! I hate all humans!
From Ashitaka for me?
Pretty.
You two, stay with San.
I must go to the Forest Spirit. Let's go.
The Moro tribe has come to fight with you. Where can I find Lord Okkoto?
Thank you.
It's coming from Irontown.
Let's go!
Who goes there? Samurai again.
Halt, I said!
Out of the way!
What the devil was that thing?
Don't waste your arrows. He's knocking them away.
-He's a dead man anyway. -Cease fire!
Toki, come and look.
It can't be. It's Ashitaka.
So it's not a ghost.
Ashitaka!
Toki!
Are you all right?
We're all right.
Lord Asano's samurai thought they'd try and ambush us while our men were away.
-Thought we'd just roll over. -But we showed them!
-Thought we'd just roll over. -But we showed them! Where's Lady Eboshi?
She took every able-bodied man and went to kill the Forest Spirit.
We're cut off here. Can't get a message to Lady Eboshi.
The Forest Spirit. That explains the explosions.
Hey, sir, I've still got your bow and arrows!
Aren't you gonna tell him you've got his cloak and saddle too?
-I do? -You're useless.
Many thanks, Kohroku!
I'll try and bring you some help! Can you hold out?
Don't worry! We can always pour hot iron on them.
Bring back Lady Eboshi!
And don't take too long!
I missed.
They're bringing boats across the river!
Go and get Lady Eboshi. We'll hold them off as long as we can!
I'll be back! I promise!
Be careful!
Get him! Stop that man!
Looks like they'll try to cut us off. Run, Yakul.
Burning animal flesh.
Yakul!
Stay back!
Show me your wound.
You'll have to stay here. Wait for me. I'll come back for you.
I said, stay!
We're almost there, my friend.
Who goes there?
My orders are no outsiders permitted here.
All right, but I've just come from Irontown. I have a message for Lady Eboshi. Tell me where she is.
I have a message for Lady Eboshi. Tell me where she is.
The Eboshi woman's not here. Give me the message. I'll make sure she gets it.
I must speak with her. Now where is she?
It's really you? You're still alive, lad?
It looks like you men had a worse time than I did.
We've been burying our friends all day.
It was horrible.
-Irontown has come under attack. -What?
The women and the lepers have fallen back to the inner wall.
We haven't got a lot of time.
Those samurai bastards.
Asano must've just been waiting for us to leave Irontown.
Now I must find Lady Eboshi.
She's off hunting down the Forest Spirit.
Then someone's got to stop her. Call her back.
If you're all done, I want you out of here.
The rest of you, keep digging!
Wait! What about Irontown?
That's right! It's our home!
What do they expect us to do, abandon Irontown?
You heard the boy! We haven't a moment to lose.
Send a message to Lady Eboshi!
No messenger would have a chance of finding her!
Then send out a hunter! What else are they good for?
Lady Eboshi is just being used by Jigo.
When you fought with the boars, were there any wolves with them?
Did you see San, the Wolf Girl?
I have no idea. It was pitch black when the animals came at us.
She was there. I saw her.
I was right in the front line. I saw everything, everything.
-What happened? -I'm not sure!
-What happened? -I'm not sure! Everything started happening so fast. It was like a nightmare.
Jigo's troops put us in front as bait to lure the boars in.
They didn't tell us about the land mines under our feet...
or the grenades coming in on top of us.
Where's San?
Take it easy. I'm trying to get you out.
There's a wolf over here!
Hey! Hurry!
Young master! What do you think you're doing?
I have got to find Lady Eboshi. This wolf's gonna help me find her.
You're on their side, aren't you, boy?
Stand aside!
What's more important? The head of the Forest Spirit or saving your town?
Those darts are poison.
That's enough now!
I'm not gonna slave any longer!
Look out!
After you've come through the swamp, take cover by the lake until we get there.
Be careful. Those riflemen with milady belong to Jigo.
Here. Take these. Where I'm going, they won't be of any use.
You go with them, Yakul. Look after him!
Find San! That's where we'll find Eboshi!
Come on. Keep moving. Straight ahead. Today we finish this.
Sir.
Yes? Have you spotted them?
Okkoto's badly wounded. He and the Wolf Girl are making their way to the realm of the Forest Spirit.
So they're going to beg him for his help, are they? Keep after them,
but stay out of sight or you'll scare the Forest Spirit away.
Yes, sir. I understand.
That was boar's blood painted on his face, wasn't it?
A little trade secret. Don't want to smell human.
We're almost at the pool of the Forest Spirit.
What was that?
Lord Okkoto, something's wrong. We have to keep moving.
Something's out there.
What? With so much blood in the air, I can't smell it.
I should have known it was you!
You did this!
Because of you, the forest will die!
You're wrong!
We've all been fighting to save it! This is the thanks you give us?
You bring bad things!
Bad things coming, neither human nor animal.
What do you mean, "neither human nor animal"?
-They're coming! -It's the end for us!
They're warriors.
They've come back.
My warriors! They have come back to me from the land of the dead.
Forward, my warriors! Forward to the pool of the Forest Spirit!
No, Lord Okkoto! Your warriors haven't come back to you.
Those are humans wearing the skins of your warriors to hide their scent!
It's a trick!
It's just a human trick to get us to lead them to the Forest Spirit!
Come out, Forest Spirit!
If you are truly master here,
give my warriors the power to slay the humans and be victorious!
Stop, Lord Okkoto, please! You've got to listen!
San, they're all around us. Okkoto's done for. Leave him!
No! I won't let him turn into a demon like Nago did!
Tell mother that the humans are setting a trap for the Forest Spirit.
She'll know what to do.
You'll have to hurry, or it could mean the end of all of us!
Go on now.
Stay back or you die!
And then this whole forest will see just what you are!
Ashitaka?
Get back!
I burn! There are flames growing inside of me.
You must fight it!
Don't let yourself become a demon!
Lord Okkoto!
What is it?
Is it San? -She's in danger. -Let's go.
-She's in danger. -Let's go.
I'm on fire.
No!
I don't want to become a demon! Please stop, Okkoto!
You're too slow! Get on!
A wolf!
Eboshi!
You keep going!
Eboshi! I have something to say!
Hold your fire!
What is it you want?
Lord Asano's samurai have attacked Irontown!
The women are outnumbered! They can't hold them off for long!
Forget about the Forest Spirit!
Your men are already heading back, but they need you to lead them!
What proof is there this isn't a lie?
Lie? Don't be ridiculous! What reason do I have to lie?
So we don't kill the forest gods. Now you want us to kill samurai instead.
No! What I want is for the humans and the forest to live in peace!
Just whose side is he on anyway?
Shouldn't we go back?
The women are on their own now. They can take care of themselves.
There's the pool. The creature must be somewhere nearby.
It's the moment of truth, boys, so keep your eyes peeled.
Why do we need that woman, sir?
When you're going to kill a god, let someone else do your dirty work.
Moro, what happened to you?
San! It's me, Ashitaka!
San!
Ashitaka!
Okkoto?
Leave, boy.
Fight me and the Forest Spirit will never come.
Lord Okkoto, calm your fury!
O mighty Lord, let me have the girl! I beg of you! Please, let her go!
San! Are you there? It's me! Ashitaka!
San!
Kill him!
Stop him! He'll ruin everything!
San!
San!
Ashitaka!
Ashitaka!
And here I was saving the last of my strength
And here I was saving the last of my strength to bite off that damn woman's head. But I must save San.
Close ranks!
Don't touch him.
He's no longer a god.
You can't even speak, can you?
Well done, men. Now, fall back and get the wounded out of here.
Ooh, what a revolting spectacle.
It's him.
Give me back my daughter, demon.
Ashitaka,
can you save the girl you love?
The Forest Spirit.
Eboshi! Hold your fire!
Eboshi! Your enemy's not the Forest Spirit.
But that should have killed it.
He's a god. It'll take more than one shot.
San!
Don't die.
I don't get it. The Great Forest Spirit took their lives away.
Quick! He's starting to change.
Now watch closely, everyone.
I'm going to show you how to kill a god,
a god of life and death.
The trick is not to fear him.
No! Stop!
Eboshi!
You will die!
She did it! Quickly! Go get the head!
Quick, Jigo! Bring me that box of yours!
The porters are all dead! Hurry! Hurry!
Be careful not to touch the spirit's body! It'll suck the life out of you!
Here it is! One head, as promised!
Milady!
I told you. A wolf's head can still bite.
Come on! We got to get out of here.
It's coming, sir!
Run!
Gonza, we've got to get to the island!
Island? I can't swim!
Then walk along the bottom.
Give her to me! I'll cut her throat!
Your claim has been avenged. Your mother saw to that. Here.
Lady Eboshi.
Help me.
Don't waste your sympathy.
I promised Toki that I'd bring you back to Irontown.
He's searching for his head. We can't stay here.
San,
you have got to help us.
No! You're on their side! You always were!
Take that damn woman and just go away!
Never! I hate all of you humans!
Yes, I'm human, San, and so are you.
Stop it! I'm a wolf, you hear?
-San? -Stay back!
I'm sorry. I tried to stop it.
It's over. Everything's over. The forest is dead.
Nothing is over. The two of us are still alive. Now, will you help me, San?
Hey, wait! Come back! Help us!
A little crisis and they panic.
Whoa! What are you doing?
Look! The head is moving!
It's calling him to us!
-It shouldn't jam anymore. -Thanks.
-It's awfully quiet. -Asano is waiting for sunrise.
I wonder if that young man ever found Lady Eboshi.
Don't worry about him. He found her, all right.
They'll be marching over that hill any minute now.
Big dope. Don't ask me why I love him. -Hey, Kohroku! -Let him sleep, Toki, while he can.
-Hey, Kohroku! -Let him sleep, Toki, while he can.
-What's that? -I don't know, but I don't like it.
It's the Nightwalker!
Everybody, hold your positions!
-Toki, it's coming right at us. -Run! We've gotta go!
No! We promised Lady Eboshi we would defend Irontown!
Look! Over there! He's come back!
Get everyone out!
The Great Spirit's head's been cut off, and he wants it back!
If that black ooze touches you, you're dead!
Run for the lake! The water will slow it down!
Lady Eboshi and the men are on their way from the other side.
I'm gonna try to return his head before he kills us all. Hurry!
-What are we gonna do now? -It'll kill us all!
-What are we gonna do now? -It'll kill us all! -We'll never get out now! -That's enough!
-We'll never get out now! -That's enough!
Get everyone down to the lake and stay calm.
We can carry the sick and the wounded.
Not that way! Stop!
Oh! There it goes!
We're done for!
Once the forge burns, it'll be the end of Irontown.
We're still alive, Kohroku. We'll manage somehow. Now, let's go.
There they are!
Go!
Stop right there!
Oh, you're both alive. Oh, how nice.
I'm giving the creature its head back. Put the box down and back away.
Give the head back now? Come on, boy. Don't be silly.
Now, when the sun's about to come up?
Look! He's a brainless, swollen, life-sucking god of death.
At sunrise he'll vanish.
Sir, it's coming! We've gotta get out of here!
Look, everybody wants everything. That's the way the world is. But I might actually get it.
Don't force me to kill you.
You make it sound so very easy. You really ought to... relax!
Get going!
Ashitaka!
This is bad.
Master, we're surrounded!
-Come on, sun! Rise! -Open the box!
Don't you see? It's too late for that now!
Why are you wasting your breath talking to him?
Human hands must return it!
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Forest Spirit!
We give you back your head!
Take it and be at peace!
Uh, well, that got his attention, all right.
Well, I think it's over.
It's the men.
-Milady! You're here! -Her ladyship has been injured.
Look! It's falling on Irontown!
Hang on tight, everybody! Don't let go!
I didn't know the Forest Spirit made the flowers grow.
San. San, look.
Even if all the trees return, it won't be his forest anymore.
The Great Forest Spirit is dead now.
Never. He's life itself. He's not dead, San.
He's here right now, trying to tell us something,
that it's time for us both to live.
Ashitaka, you mean so much to me, but I can't forgive the humans for what they've done.
I understand. You'll live in the forest, and I'll go help them rebuild Irontown.
I'll always be near.
Yakul and I will come and visit you... whenever we can, all right?
Amazing. The wolves and that crazy little Wolf Girl helped save us all.
Ashitaka. Can someone find him? I need to thank him.
We're going to start all over again. This time we'll build a better town.
It's today! It's today!
It's today! It's today! It's today!
It's always today, George.
-I mean, this is the day. -That's right.
-Can't I come? -You have to go to school, George.
-Will he be here when I get home? -I think so.
I'll play ball with him. I'll wrestle with him.
I'll teach him how to spit.
-It's gonna be so much fun. -For all of us.
How will you know if you pick the right one?
I don't know. We'll....
You'll just know.
Bye, sweetie.
Remember, I want a little brother, not a big brother.
We've been through your paperwork, and it seems to be in order.
Adoption isn't for everyone...
...but you seem like people with plenty of love to share.
So how are you feeling?
-Goodness, we're-- -Tingling--
With anticipation.
Recess.
Time for you to meet them.
Feel free to walk around. They're used to having strangers.
Thank you.
Lovely people.
Oh, Frederick, look at them.
-How could we possibly--? -Choose? I know.
-They all seem so-- -Wonderful.
You know what's wonderful?
What's wonderful is...
...how you both know what the other one is gonna say...
...before you even say it.
Not that it's any of my business.
Yes, that happens when you've been together as long as we have.
From being a family.
Family. Wow.
Well, for a family, you've certainly come to the right place.
I think we can find just what you're looking for.
If you want a girl, Susan can read French.
And Edith over there can tap-dance while blowing bubbles.
Or maybe you wanted a boy.
Actually, we were leaning towards a boy.
Well, in that case...
...Benny can do handstands.
Andy can run 100 yards faster than you can say, "Ready, set, go."
You certainly know a lot about everyone.
That's what happens when you've been here as long as I have.
Let's face it. Not everyone wants to adopt someone like me.
You shouldn't worry about choosing.
It happens the same way every time.
First, you won't know what to do. You'll be a bit scared.
Then you'll meet one of them.
You'll talk to him.
Somehow...
...you just know.
Are you quite certain you're prepared to handle his uniqueness?
Oh, my, yes.
His uniqueness is a perfect fit for the Little family.
Mr. and Mrs. Little, we try to discourage couples...
Mr. and Mrs. Little, we try to discourage couples... ...from adopting children outside their own...
...species.
It rarely works out.
Well, it will in this case.
Bye, Stuart!
Bye! We'll miss you!
So what do I call you?
-Mom. -And Dad.
We haven't told you the best news. You have a brother.
Named George.
A brother!
-What do I call him? -George.
Well, Stuart, here we are, the family home.
They say every Little can find this house.
Even if they've never been here.
It's just something inside them.
Something inside.
So would you like a tour?
I don't have any money.
That's Uncle Crenshaw, Cousin Edgar, Grandpa Spencer.
That's Aunt Beatrice...
...and that's George, your brother.
Look, he's already happy to see me.
That's just about everybody, except for--
Snowbell! Drop him right now!
You spit Stuart out this instant.
Stuart, are you all right?
Wait!
I'm fine.
You must never harm Stuart. Understand?
Never, or out you'll go, Mr. Snow.
Stuart is family now. We do not eat family members.
Mom, Dad, I'm home!
Is my brother here?
-He certainly is. -Where is he?
He's here. Stuart, this is George.
George, this is Stuart, your new brother.
No. Really?
Really, George. This is your new brother.
You look somewhat like a mouse.
Yeah, well, I am somewhat like a mouse.
I see.
I have to go.
Is it just me, or did he seem a little disappointed?
Well, he's always a little tired after school.
Perks up around dinnertime.
Meat loaf is delicious, dear.
Cajun.
Shall we get to know each other a little?
George? Don't you have anything you wanna ask Stuart?
Sure, George. Go ahead. I'm an open book.
Ask me anything, the first thing that pops into your head.
Could you pass the gravy?
-Your new bedroom. -We hope you like it.
Sure is roomy.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.
-Good night, son. -Good night, sweetie.
Nice kitty.
Nice kitty. Pretty kitty.
Are you cozy?
Yes, thanks. I'm quite comfortable.
All I've got to sleep on is a rag, you little rat!
-You seem tense. -Tense?
I'm way past tense.
Well, maybe I can help.
What do you like? Can I scratch your ears?
I could rub your tummy.
How'd you like to rub it from the inside?
I'm confused. I thought that's what you do with a pet.
A pet? I am not your pet!
I'm a cat. You're a mouse. You should live in a hole.
This is my family.
Can't we share them?
Read my furry pink lips: No.
I can't believe this. I'm arguing with lunch.
Stay away from the windows.
The other cats find out about this, I'm ruined.
I gotta relax. Where's my tinkle ball?
George? Time to get up.
Okay, Mom.
Stuart, you too.
Okay, Mom.
George, I'm trying to get the laundry started.
In the laundry chute, please!
Thank you.
Oh, dear.
Mom! Hello! Mom!
It's Stuart! I'm in the washing machine. Mom!
Hello, Mom!
Where are you going?
-That's odd. -What is?
-I thought someone was at the door. -You look beautiful, dear.
Honey, should we talk to George before you go?
-About what? -About Stuart.
He hasn't exactly embraced the situation.
Snowbell! Thank goodness you're here.
I'm locked in the washer!
Can you help me? Can you turn this thing off?
Why would I turn it off?
It's my favorite show.
That's funny. That's funny, Snowbell.
-You can't leave me! -Talk to the butt.
Where are you going?
I've gotta stare at traffic, yawn, lick myself.
And believe me, that could take hours if you do it right.
Ciao!
Are you sure that Stuart is happy here?
He's having the time of his life.
Help! Somebody, please help me!
Hi, Stuart.
Stuart, where are you?
Stuart, are you all right?
I'm okay, Mom. I'm--
Is he gonna be all right?
Well, a lad that size swallowing all that detergent....
Amazingly, I think he's gonna be fine.
Also he's very clean.
-Glad you're feeling better. -Me too.
We'll pick out a whole new wardrobe.
Here you go.
Come on, George. This'll be fun.
I don't wanna go shopping with Stuart.
-You should-- -Talk to him. You're right.
So, George, I wanted to talk to you about Stuart.
I just want you to know that if you and he were to spend...
I just want you to know that if you and he were to spend... ...some real time together, brother time--
Look at that one.
Come on, George. You have a boat, a beautiful one.
It's not finished.
You better get moving. The race is soon.
So?
Don't you want to race your boat?
-I'm not so good at the racing part. -So what?
It doesn't matter about winning. You try like heck, and you have fun.
It's fun to finish last?
Something formal, I should think.
I'm not sure of the fabric, but it should breathe.
He has a tendency to burrow and climb...
...and generally scurry about.
Well, I'm sure we can find something to suit your particular need.
Here we have Barbados Ben.
Chef Ben.
Lumberjack Ben.
And, of course, Gladiator Ben.
-Does Ben always dress like this? -No, madam.
There are many moods of Ben...
...and it all depends on the occasion.
Well, what if the occasion were a simple family party?
I think I have just the thing.
There they are.
George?
Shopping?
-Everything all right in there? -Don't come in.
Shy.
How do I look?
-Fantastic. I hardly recognize you. -Very smart.
You look just like a Little.
I do?
Good.
I was worried I was gonna look just like Ben.
Hi, auntie.
-Crenshaw! -Frederick!
Little high, Little low.
Little hey, Little ho!
We come bearing gifts for young Stuart.
Where is my new nephew?
The Little family's getting bigger and bigger.
Boy.
That's a lot of Littles.
Uncle Crenshaw!
There's my favorite little nephew.
You can't say that anymore, Crenshaw.
Right. Now we have two favorite little nephews.
-Where is the lad? -He has a lot of gifts to open.
Are any of those for me?
Attention, everybody.
We'd like to introduce you to someone.
This is Stuart.
Hello, everyone.
-He's a-- A-- -Adorable!
-Adorable. -Yeah, that's right.
I couldn't think of the word.
Oh, Stuart, look.
Look at that. This is a real Schmelling.
-Those are the best kind. -You know what they say:
-"If it ain't Schmelling...." -"It ain't bowling."
Look here, Stuart.
Climb on up here, son. Plant your caboose right up here.
He may have to grow into it.
I think he's grown a little since we've been here.
That's what happened to me. One summer, I just shot right up.
May I say something?
In the orphanage, we used to tell fairy tales...
...of finding our families and having a party like this.
A party with cakes and presents and all varieties of meat loaf.
A party with a big family who came from far away just to wish us well.
I don't know much about families...
...but this must be the nicest family in the world.
So I just wanted to thank each of you.
Because now I know...
...fairy tales are real.
Fairy tales are real?
I think I'm gonna cough up a furball.
Now it's time for the best present.
It's something for you and George.
Stand next to Stuart.
This is something that gave your father and me...
...hours of enjoyment when we were young brothers...
...just like you and Stuart.
This ball...
...belonged to your great-great-grandfather...
...Jedediah Little.
Remember, Frederick, those long summer days playing catch?
Take your brother outside and toss around the old horsehide.
What do you say? You ready?
Are you all nuts?
Bicycles and bowling balls?
How will he toss a baseball? How will he do any of those things?
He's not my brother. He's a mouse.
-Time to go. -Excellent idea.
What, what? Where?
Did I hurt you? What's the matter?
I just wanted to ask you something, but you were already asleep.
-What did you want to ask? -About my real family.
You know, the ones I look like.
He hates us.
We've never been hated before.
No, it's not that. It's not that at all.
It's just that...
...something's missing.
I feel an empty space inside me...
...and I want to know what was there before.
You have an empty space.
That's so sad.
Oh, dear. I hope I haven't left you dismayed and disappointed.
-No, don't, no. -No.
We don't feel dismayed and disappointed.
Not at all.
Are you sure?
We're certain, Stuart.
And if you want us to, we'll find out about your real parents.
Well, good night then.
Out of the question. It's against the rules.
Besides, it's very hard to track mouse families.
They're not very good with paperwork.
But he has an empty space.
Are there problems with Stuart?
Problem--? No, not at all.
-Well, there's been a few.... -Difficulties.
Difficulties?
Well, like the cat trying to eat him when we first brought him home.
He spat the boy out, of course, in one heck of a jiffy.
Mrs. Keeper....
He wants to know about his family.
Any child would have questions about that.
Yes.
Hey, Snow?
I know that you and I got off on the wrong paw.
I just wanted to see if we could start out fresh.
You know? Clean slate.
What do you say? Wanna be friends?
No.
Okay then.
He's playing with my head. He's trying to psych me out.
Sick little rodent!
Snow, let me in! I'm starving! What's in the dish today?
Snow, let me in! I'm starving! What's in the dish today? Oh, no. Monty the Mouth.
If he sees Stuart, it'll be all over the neighborhood.
Go away! There's no food.
Please.
I'm not picky, as long as it ain't meat loaf.
That stuff gives me gas something awful.
Sorry, it's meat loaf.
Beggars can't be choosers. Load me up and light a match.
No, Monty. Stop. You don't wanna do that.
I eat from garbage cans, drink from public toilets.
Like a little gas will bother me.
No, wait. Don't!
Oh, great. What am I gonna tell him now?
Monty, I can explain.
-He's.... -Explain what?
Explain that you should stuff your face.
Oh, thanks.
I don't wanna rush you, but you have to leave.
The Littles are due back, and they don't like strange cats in the house.
Not that you're strange.
-Snow, what's wrong with you? -Nothing.
You're the one acting strange. What is it? Worms? Fleas?
Yeah, you look pale.
Maybe you should see a vet.
A vet? What a swell idea.
Do you know one? I'm not happy with mine.
He makes us wait, and his hands are cold.
-What was that? -What was that what?
What was that-- What?
Well, I hate to eat and run.
No, please. By all means, run.
Run like the wind!
Phew, that was gross.
Snow, I almost forgot to thank you.
What the...?
Oh, no.
Oh, my pants.
They're putting some wild prizes in there.
Hello. You must be a friend of Snowbell's.
-I'm Stuart. -Aren't you gonna run?
Why?
Because you're a mouse.
I'm not just a mouse.
I'm also a member of this family.
A mouse with a pet cat.
A mouse with a pet cat!
I guess that is pretty funny.
Pretty funny?! I'm gonna wet my fur!
A mouse with a pet cat!
Your new little master.
Wait till the boys hear about this.
The humiliation.
I'm gonna kill you!
Come back here!
All right. No more Mr. Nice Kitty.
You!
You can't go in there.
That's George's room! Come back. Come on out.
I won't hurt you.
I just wanna show you something.
What are you doing here?
I just thought I'd drop in.
Did you build these?
Me and my dad.
This is incredible. It's like being in a real live Western.
Howdy, partner.
Draw, you lily-livered, yellow-bellied son-of-a-one-eyed prairie dog.
I'm trying to concentrate.
Sorry.
Is that a train?
What's it look like, picklehead?
Could we play with it? Please, please, please?
Help! Somebody help me!
Help! Please! Somebody help me!
-Thank you very much. Thank you. -You're crazy.
I have an idea.
Hop in.
A roadster.
Go ahead, check it out.
Stuart, what's wrong?
Nothing....
It's the first time I've fit in since I got here.
What's that?
Oh, that.
That's the Wasp.
She is beautiful.
-But she's not finished. -When are you gonna finish it?
Me and my dad were building her, but I decided to stop.
How come?
I'm too little for a race like that.
Little? You're not little.
Well, not to me.
You've never seen one of these races.
There's hundreds of people there. Everybody from school.
I mean... ...what if you lost?
At least you'll have been somewhere.
Come on, George. What do you say?
Let's get started.
You know...
...I'm not sure I want a brother.
How about a friend?
I guess I can always use a friend.
-George? -Yes, Dad?
Have you seen Stuart?
He's down here with me.
What are you doing to him?
He's helping me finish the Wasp.
That's wonderful, son.
That's terrific.
Can't race her like this.
-Right, George? -Right.
-When's the next race? -Two days.
-Two days? -We'll be ready.
-Let's all go together. -That's a wonderful idea.
-That would be great. -All of us together.
The whole family.
The whole family.
I'm telling you, Snowy, this guy can fix anything.
But they're alley cats: mean, vicious and all hopped up on catnip.
Quit being a scaredy-cat. You wanna get rid of the mouse?
Of course I do.
All right then.
Hey, Smokey!
Smokey, it's me. It's me, Monty.
What is it now?
Well, my friend Snowbell here needs a favor.
Snowbell?
There's a manly name.
You see, sir, I've got this mouse at home I can't eat.
Sensitive stomach?
No. I can't eat him, because he's a member of the family.
A mouse with a pet cat?
Isn't that funny?
That's not funny.
That's sick.
A cat can't have a rodent for a master.
I mean, it's against the laws of nature.
Word of this gets out, it'll be bad for cats all over.
Can you help me?
Consider it done.
Did you hear that, Monty? Thank you, Mr. Smokey, sir.
I'll never forget this. Really.
Don't worry, Tinkerbell. I'm all over it.
Tinkerbell! He called me Tinkerbell.
-You're a funny guy. -Whatever.
Jeez, house cats.
He'll keep this hush-hush?
You kidding? Cat's got his tongue. Get it?
Cat's got his tongue because he's a cat.
-Shut up. -Okay.
Ahoy, fellow yachtsmen!
And welcome, everyone, to the 92nd annual...
...Central Park Boat Race...
...undoubtedly model racing's most prestigious event.
Children from all over New York gather here every year...
...to see whose boat will prevail.
Who will win the race and take home the magnificent trophy?
-Anchor up? -Check.
-Stays all battened? -Check.
-Rudder? -Check.
-Sail? -Check.
They're doing checks.
George, Stuart, would you like a hot dog?
-Check. -Check.
And from Manhattan's Upper West Side...
...the Wasp, piloted by George Little.
Everything seems shipshape.
But to be on the safe side, I'll check for leaks.
Oh, no. Anton.
Gee, George, what did you do? Get that out of a cereal box?
I'm glad you're here, George.
Someone's gotta finish last.
I don't like that child.
All set to get under way.
It's time to get those boats in the water and grab your remote.
Stuart, could you get the remote?
Aye, aye, captain.
Doesn't she look great?
Are you okay?
-Maybe we should go home. -Why?
I'm not wearing my lucky underwear.
You don't have lucky underwear.
Maybe we should get some and then come back for another race.
Listen, I know how worried you are about losing, believe me.
But you know what we say? The thing that matters...
...is to never stop trying. Okay?
That's the spirit.
Everyone to your places. The race is about to start.
Where's Stuart?
Look out, sir!
Stuart, are you hurt?
-What happened? -It was my fault. I couldn't grip it.
Nice going, Captain Loser.
George, wait.
Oh, honey. Everything will be all right.
No, it won't.
Maybe we could fix it. A little glue. Who'll know?
Mom.
This is awful. Our first family outing. I ruined everything.
Well, you know, Stuart...
...these things happen.
But what about George?
I'll be back.
George, you know what?
Just because we can't be in the race...
...doesn't mean our family outing has to be ruined.
All boats to your marks. Ready, and....
And the race is on.
We should just go home.
The sails are full and-- There's a mouse on that boat?
-What are you doing? -Sailing. I hope.
Stuart, come back here.
-I can't. -Why not?
I don't know how!
The players are jockeying for position.
Frederick, I don't like this one bit.
Your mother doesn't like this.
I'm okay, Mom!
Go, Stuart!
Tighten the mainsail!
What's a mainsail?
Move!
Come on, Stuart!
-Gee, George, you all done crying? -Yeah.
-You all done being a jerk? -No.
Don't worry, George! I won't let you down!
Away those boats are sailing....
What if he falls?
Remember, he's quite a fine swimmer.
That's cheating. You can't do that.
Well, I just did.
Oh, dear.
-What is he doing? -I think he's hiking out.
Hope that mouse can swim.
-Wasp is taking the lead. -Look out!
That can't be good.
Look what that stupid mouse did!
He's not a stupid mouse.
You're right. He's a stupid rat.
-Hey, come on. -Get off me. Get off!
Something's wrong.
What's happening?
Who is that mouse anyway?
That's no mouse. That's my brother.
Frederick, look at them.
You know what? This calls for a picture.
-What's wrong? -Well, it's just...
...you four look great together.
This is the happiest moment of my life.
I feel 10 inches tall.
I'll get that.
-Mr. Little. -Yes?
Down here.
Sorry to disturb you at your abode.
I hope we're not intruding.
My name's Reginald Stout. This is my wife, Camille.
An extreme pleasure.
We're looking for Stuart.
Are you friends of his?
Well, not exactly.
-Fellow yachtsmen? -Guess again.
Reggie, just tell them.
We're his parents.
Reggie, stop it!
It's so good to see you again, Stuart.
There's so much we have to catch up on.
Why didn't you want me?
It shames me to say this, but you weren't born into a prosperous home.
That's right. We couldn't feed you, dear.
Couldn't feed him? How much could he eat?
George, please.
Letting you go was the toughest choice we ever made.
-It was? -Yes.
But now we can be a family again.
Absolutely. Are these salted?
Dear. The children.
George, Stuart, I think we need to talk to the Stouts alone.
Don't worry. Mom and Dad will take care of it.
I'm afraid there's been a mistake.
Stuart can't leave with you. He's--
-One of the family. -Exactly.
You may feel like he's family, but he'll never really be family.
You may not realize it, but I'm sure he does.
There's something you'll never be able to give him, because you're human.
It's a place that you can never fill.
An empty space.
Mom...
...Dad, you want me to leave?
No.
Dear, we just want what's best for you.
But Stuart lives here.
George, come on. This is hard for all of us.
This stinks!
I don't understand.
I thought I was in a fairy tale.
Fairy tales are made-up stories.
This is real. This is about where you belong.
Please come home, Stuart. Your real home.
You're gonna love it, son. We live on a golf course!
-We look right over the fairway! -It's beautiful.
Beautiful.
Taxi!
What's a mouse have to do to get a cab in this city?
Will you speak to George for me?
I'd hate to say goodbye to a basement door.
Of course.
Taxi!
Yo, taxi!
Time to go, Stuart!
Goodbye.
We love you.
I love you too, Mom.
Mrs. Little.
Boy, that looks heavy. You need help with that?
Camille?
Frederick, let's do something.
What?
Let's just make them go away. We're bigger than they are.
We'll say, "Go. Shoo." We'll scare their whiskers off.
Eleanor, you're not being rational.
Rational, shmational.
Something about this is not right. I just know it.
Look at them. They just fit.
So? I have shoes that fit and I hate them! As Stuart's mother--
So? I have shoes that fit and I hate them! As Stuart's mother-- But you're not.
She is.
Wait!
I want you to have this.
Not the roadster, George. You love this car. I couldn't.
I want you to.
Thanks, George.
I wish you didn't have to go.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you too, George.
Sing with me, Stuie!
Tell me your favorite foods so I can fix them for you.
What for? You can't cook.
But I can learn. We're a family now.
And there's adjustments we'll have to make. Right, Reggie?
Right, Camille.
Here we are, Stuie, the family home.
The family home.
This is just our summer place.
Winter, we live above a delicatessen. You like corned beef?
-How's it prepared? -Prepared?
It drops out of a fat guy's mouth, we grab it and run.
-Sounds like an acquired taste. -Acquired taste? I love this kid!
Your new bedroom, Stuart.
We hope you like it.
Well, good night. Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite.
I'm serious about those bedbugs. Keep an eye open.
It's kind of you to check on us like this.
Actually, I had something to tell you.
But first, how are things going?
-It's been difficult. -Difficult?
No, very difficult.
-Very difficult? -Worse.
Worse than very difficult?
-Yes, it's been almost-- -Unbearable.
Just the word I was looking for.
Maybe this isn't a good time then.
You see, I came over to give you some news.
What type of news?
-They had an accident. -Who?
Stuart's parents.
My goodness. Well, are they all right?
No. They didn't make it.
Oh, no. Oh, my!
-What happened? -Well, apparently...
-What happened? -Well, apparently... ...they were grocery shopping, canned-food aisle.
There was an unsteady pyramid of cans and it collapsed.
Took three bag boys to dig them out.
They identified them by their dental records.
Oh, how horrible!
Cream of mushroom soup. Two-for-one sale.
That's a very heavy soup.
How is Stuart taking it?
Well, he doesn't know.
No one's told him?
Does he have to know?
Six months after, won't he wonder where they went?
But they've been gone for years.
Years? How is that possible?
Because they died years ago. Which part is confusing you?
Stuart's parents took him away three days ago.
Three days ago?
Stuart's parents died... ...in a tragic cream-mushroom-soup incident years ago.
...in a tragic cream-mushroom-soup incident years ago.
I just told you.
We have to take this up with the police.
Mrs. Little?
I'm Detective Sherman. This is my partner, Detective Allen.
-We understand your son is missing. -Thank you for coming.
They know about the Stouts!
-The jig is up! What will we do? -Get ahold of yourself.
I'm in big--! I'm in deep poopy-do!
Calm down. Don't get your fur in a bunch.
All we need is a new plan.
We do what we should've done in the first place.
-We scratch him out. -Scratch him out?
But, Smokey!
The police are involved. I don't wanna get kicked out.
I'm not a street cat. I'm a house cat.
I don't wanna lose my furry basket or my tinkle ball!
Buddy, pull yourself together.
It's settled.
Stuart Little gets scratched tonight.
Okay. Very good.
Mr. and Mrs. Little, you'll have to come downtown.
Detective Sherman, what are our chances of seeing Stuart again?
You want it straight?
-No. -Absolutely not.
Well, in that case...
...Stuart's probably home right now waiting for you.
Maybe we should hear it a little straighter than that.
In a case like this...
...if the kidnappers have not called by now...
...then they're not interested in money.
-What are they interested in? -Kicks.
Exactly.
It's my guess these two sickos...
...are on some kind of cross-country mouse-killing spree.
Well, thank you.
You can kiss him goodbye.
Thank you.
It's over. The things I've seen.
Phil, where is that book on the grisly photos?
Believe me, you don't want to see this.
It'll only take a second.
Right off the bat. Look at this one.
This one kept me awake for weeks.
What did they want?
Where's the boy?
Oh, no.
Stuart, wake up.
-Get dressed. -Why?
-We're going for a ride. -Where?
Some friends of ours want to meet you.
A gathering? What should I wear?
It doesn't matter. Wear anything.
-Is it formal? -Just put something on!
Why is Mom crying?
Mom? I'm not angry at you for putting me up for adoption.
And now that I'm a Stout again, I'll always be here to take care of you.
Because that's what families do.
Mom, they take care of each other.
Tell him the truth!
You made a deal with a cat?
He had us cornered at the bottom of the cup.
It was curtains.
So you agreed to pose as my parents?
You lied and cheated?
You took me away from the Littles just when we were all so happy?
-Yes! -That's wonderful.
I think you missed something.
That's why I've been feeling sad. That's why I keep thinking of them!
I'm not a Stout. I'm a Little!
I'm Stuart Little!
I'm Stuart Little!
Stuart, please. You have to listen to us.
The cats decided you're too risky to keep around.
They ordered us to hand you over.
As your fake father, I order you to run.
-I'll go home. -Home? That's miles from here. And every cat in the city is looking for you.
That's miles from here. And every cat in the city is looking for you.
Besides, you could get lost.
No, I can't.
Every Little in the world can find the Little house.
Bye, fake father! Goodbye, fake mother!
-Goodbye, fake son. -Goodbye, Stuart.
I'm gonna miss that boy.
I'm gonna miss that car.
-Well, I think we have to-- -Tell him.
-Who has the glue? -I'm the glue man.
What's going on?
-We're making posters. -We'll put them up all over the city.
They describe Stuart and offer a reward.
Isn't it wonderful?
It was all George's idea.
Never stop trying. Right, Dad?
Listen, I'm afraid this isn't gonna work.
Why not?
Frederick.
Because there's no picture. We need a picture of Stuart.
The family photo.
Smokey. Hey, Smokey!
Keep it down.
It's me, Lucky.
I just heard from the Brooklyn cats. Bad news. The Stouts squealed.
I knew those mice were rats.
The kid's on his way home. What do we do?
No problem. He's gotta go through the park, right?
Let's meet him and have ourselves a picnic.
Great. I'll bring herring.
Moron! The mouse is the picnic.
Every Little in the world can find the Little house.
I'm a Little. I'm a Little.
I'm a little lost.
How you doing?
You must be Stuart.
-Actually, I must be going. -What's your hurry, Murray?
Yeah, where are you going, Murray-- Stuart? What's his name?
Come back, you little rat!
-He's getting away! -Lucky, Red, get him!
-He's going backwards! -He's a hell of a driver!
-Go, go, go, go! -We got him!
I got him, Smokey. Yeah, I got him.
The only thing that you guys got are big mouths.
So shut up and run!
-Geronimo! -Banzai!
We got him now!
-I got him! I got him! -Get him, Red!
I hope he runs out of gas!
I hope you do.
-Run in the back. -I can't help it.
I have a nervous stomach.
And I have an empty stomach! Now get that mouse!
Did you see that? Damn.
Nobody could've survived that.
Yeah, the mouse is sleeping with the fishes.
Long, wet nap.
The sewer rat's alive! After him!
No way. I'm a cat. I don't do water.
Red, you go.
You want to do water, hire a spaniel.
I don't believe this. What are you guys, a bunch of house cats?
Oh, no! Oh, dear.
Oh, no! Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Crenshaw, Tina, Uncle Stretch, you go uptown.
Cover as many streets as you can.
Edgar, Beatrice, Spencer, you take downtown.
Every side street and back alley.
Estelle.
You better go with them.
Where do I go?
You come with us. We'll circle the park.
I made it.
I can't believe it. I'm home.
Mom! Dad! I'm coming!
It's me, Stuart! I'm back!
Where is everybody?
There's nobody else here.
It's just you and me, kid.
Where'd they go?
Movies, I think.
Movies?
Since you left, it's just movies, parties...
...roller-skating, amusement parks.
They're having the time of their lives.
-They are? -Oh, sure.
I hate to have to tell you this, but they're celebrating.
Celebrating what?
-Can't you guess? -No.
They were just so happy to get rid of you.
That's a lie! I don't believe that.
Oh, boy.
I wish I could spare you this. This is gonna break your heart.
Look up there.
At what?
See for yourself.
They did that right after you left.
Mrs. Little said, "Who wants to look at that face anymore?"
-She did? -Yeah.
-And George? -She gave it to him, and he tore it up.
-He did? -Yeah.
I'd give you the pieces, but Mr. Little set them on fire.
I tried to warn you, Stuart. I told you it wasn't gonna work out.
I should've known.
It was too good to be true.
What're you gonna do now?
I don't know. I guess I'll--
Leave immediately? Good idea.
I'll tell the family you dropped by, although it'll probably make them sick.
Bye, Snowbell.
Goodbye, buddy.
This is killing me.
But I'm almost done.
It's getting late. Time to go home.
I didn't miss a single tree.
You did a great job.
-It was a good idea, wasn't it? -You bet it was.
It's a really good picture of Stuart.
I don't think you could take a bad picture of Stuart.
Now all we have to do...
...is wait until somebody calls and tells us where Stuart is.
Right.
If we don't find Stuart, it's gonna break his heart.
Hey, Snow! A guy spotted Stuart. Smokey sent me to get you.
Gee, Monty, I'm in for the night. It's late.
Besides, Stuart is gone. Can't we give the kid a break?
We could give him a break.
First we'll break his arms, then his legs, and then we'll take a break.
First we gotta find him. Come on, we gotta run!
Why do we have to run? What is it, festival seating?
Come on! I think we're getting closer. I can smell him.
Sorry, Smokey, that was me.
Didn't your mothers warn you not to go into Central Park at night?
My mother was the reason you didn't go into Central Park at night.
Yeah, you tell them, Smokey.
She was one tough broad. She was a saint.
Quick question. Who knows CPR?
Mouse prints are going everywhere.
-How will we find him? -We'll split up...
-...and go in different directions. -What a brain.
That is why he is gatto di tutti i gatti.
You guys go ahead.
I'll just collapse right here.
Stuart, is that you? What are you doing up there?
I'm settling in.
You got to get out of here.
This is Central Park. It's dark.
There are hungry cats all over.
-Where are you? -It's your pal, Monty.
What's he doing here?
-He'll hear you. -Why shouldn't he hear me?
Snowbell! Buddy! What're you doing up there?
Oh, no. Perfect.
You found him. Attaboy! Hey, everybody!
Over here! Hey, guys!
Snow found him!
Nice going, house cat.
Just for that, when we carve up the mouse, you'll get the big half.
Big half? Snowbell, what's he talking about?
Do you know those cats?
Not really. We went to a few parties, but....
What's the matter?
-What are you waiting for? -Bring him down! I'm starving!
Sorry, kid.
Wait, no! Stop!
Put me down!
Hit me! I'm open! I'll break his fall with my mouth!
I guess you do know them.
Let him go! I can almost taste him!
What are you waiting for?
Where are you going?
He's hogging the mouse.
-Get him! -He's getting away!
-Let's get him! -Go! Go!
Snowbell. Watch it. Where are you going?
Hold that branch for me.
Get out of my face.
Get him!
You saved me?
Let's get one thing straight. I'm doing this for the Littles.
They love you. George loves you.
They're all miserable without you.
But, Snowbell, you said--
I know what I said.
I lied, okay? Welcome to Manhattan.
I'm the one that hates you.
You do care.
Yeah, okay. That's enough.
Snow, what's he doing to your leg?
I can't help but think this is wrong.
What the hell's going on?
Look, Smokey, call me fickle, but...
...I want to call this whole thing off, okay?
Too late.
Come on, Smokey. Can't we talk it over?
Stuart's not so bad once you get to know him.
And he's got his own car.
Careful, house cat. You're asking for it.
Snow, what are you doing? Come on! He's just a mouse.
He's not "just a mouse." He's....
He's....
He's family.
I could see the resemblance.
Is that what you think? You have to look alike to be family?
You don't have to look alike.
You don't have to like each other. Look at him.
He hates me. And still, he's trying to save me.
Sure, you'll probably scratch him up pretty bad.
You may even kill him, but Snowbell will not run away.
And that is what family is all about.
Right?
Maybe "family" is too strong a word.
-Scratch them both. -Both?
It's me you want! Come and get me!
Here we go!
Get him!
Out of my way!
Get him! He's getting away!
Did he fall in the water?
I saw something hit.
Man, did you see that? Gone. He just disappeared.
There he is!
Up there!
He's too far. I can't reach him.
In that case, you can all go home. Prowl safely.
Here you go, boys. Dinner's served.
All right. Way to go!
Oh, dear.
It's mouse on a stick. I love mouse on a stick.
A little further. Keep him coming. Keep him coming.
I can almost reach him.
Keep it coming.
I got him. He's mine.
The branch is gonna....
Well, what have we got here?
Don't come out here! The branch is breaking!
-Are you all right? -Yeah, I'm okay.
Hang on. I'll take it from here.
Take what?
Come on, Snow. You wouldn't do this to me.
Not your old buddy.
Don't worry, buddy. I'm sure you'll...
Don't worry, buddy. I'm sure you'll... -...land on your... -What are you doing?
-...land on your... -What are you doing?
-Wait! I gotta ask you something! -...feet!
Cold! Cold! Cold water!
I can't swim.
-Dog paddle! -I'd rather drown.
And I had my fur just the way I like it.
I'll be licking myself for days.
How could he do this to me, after all we've meant to each other?
I mean, I love that guy!
Hey, you guys! Wait up for me!
Pack up the pineapple, Stuart!
This luau's over.
Thanks, Snowbell. You were great.
It must've been quite a show from up there.
Those cats think they're so tough.
I guess I showed them.
Not bad for a house cat!
Not bad for a dead house cat.
Say good night, Tinkerbell.
His name is Snowbell!
Oh, this water's damn cold. I can't believe this!
Beaten by a mouse and his pet cat. What could be worse?
Nice doggy! No! No!
Let's go home.
You know, Snow, I don't know how to thank you.
How about not kicking me? I'm beginning to bruise.
Sorry. I was getting excited. I've never ridden a cat bareback before.
Well, don't get used to it.
Hold on, cowboy.
-Thanks for the ride. -Don't mention it. Ever.
Mom! Dad!
George!
It's me! Stuart! I'm back!
Mom! Dad! George!
I missed you all so much!
I thought I'd never see you again!
I don't understand. How did you manage it?
Every Little in the world can find the Little house. And Snowbell.
I just couldn't have done it without him.
Really?
What's the matter?
I was just thinking.
What, dear?
That this is how people look....
At the end of a fairy tale.
Keep it clear! Okay, down!

What's this I hear at the airport?
Hammond's not even here? He sends his apologies.
We are facing a $20-million lawsuit by the family of that worker,
and you're telling me that Hammond can't even be bothered to see me?
He had to leave early to be with his daughter. She's getting a divorce.
I understand that, but we've been advised to deal with the situation now.
The insurance company-- You okay?
The underwriters feel that the accident has raised...
some very serious safety questions about the park.
That makes the investors very, very anxious.
I had to promise to conduct a very thorough on-site inspection.
Hammond hates inspections. They slow everything down.
Juanito, they'll pull the funding. ¡Jefe, jefe!
Juanito, they'll pull the funding. ¡Jefe, jefe! That'll slow him down more. Encontramos otros mosquitos.
Ooh! Aaah! Watch your head.
If two experts sign off on the island,
the insurance guys will back off.
I've already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.
They want Alan Grant. Grant? You'll never get him out of Montana.
¡Luz, mas luz! Why not? ¡Muchachos, echenme luz! Sí.
Why not?
Because Grant's like me.
He's a digger.
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler, we're ready to try again.
I hate computers. The feeling's mutual.
How long does this usually take?
It should bring an immediate return.
You shoot the radar into the ground, and the bone bounces the image back.
You shoot the radar into the ground, and the bone bounces the image back. Bounces it back.
Bounces it back.
[ Beeping ] This new program's incredible.
A few more years' development, and we won't even have to dig anymore.
Where's the fun in that? [ Chuckling ]
It's a little distorted, but I don't think it's the computer.
Hmm. Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.
- Velociraptor? - Yes. Good shape too.
It's five, six feet high. I'm guessing nine feet long. Look at the extraordinary--
What'd you do? He touched it.
[ Laughing ] Dr. Grant's not machine compatible.
Hell, they've got it in for me.
And look at the half-moon shaped bones in the wrists.
It's no wonder these guys learned how to fly.
[ Group Chuckling ] No, seriously.
Well, maybe dinosaurs have more in common with present-day birds...
than they do with reptiles.
Look at the pubic bone, turned backward, just like a bird.
Look at the vertebrae, full of air sacs and hollows, just like a bird.
And even the word "raptor" means "bird of prey."
[ Boy ] That doesn't look very scary.
[ Man ] That kid's a pistol.
More like a six-foot turkey. [ Group Laughing ]
A turkey, huh? Oh, no.
Okay. Here we go.
Try to imagine yourself in the Cretaceous Period.
You get your first look at this six-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.
He moves like a bird, lightly bobbing his head.
And you keep still because you think that maybe his visual acuity...
is based on movement, like T. rex, and he'll lose you if you don't move.
But no, not Velociraptor. [ Sighing ]
You stare at him, and he just stares right back.
And that's when the attack comes.
Not from the front, but from the side.
From the other two raptors you didn't even know were there.
Because Velociraptor's a pack hunter, you see.
He uses coordinated attack patterns,
and he is out in force today.
And he slashes at you with this,
a six-inch retractable claw, like a razor, on the middle toe.
He doesn't bother to bite your jugular like a lion, say.
No, no. He slashes at you here or here.
Oh, Alan.
Or maybe across the belly, spilling your intestines.
The point is, you are alive when they start to eat you.
So you know, try to show a little respect. Okay.
Hey, Alan, if you wanted to scare the kid,
you could have pulled a gun on him, you know.
Yeah, I know. Kids.
You want to have one of those? I don't want that kid.
But a breed of a child, Dr. Grant, could be intriguing.
I mean, what's so wrong with kids? Oh, Ellie, look.
They're noisy, they're messy, they're expensive. Cheap, cheap.
They smell. They do not smell.
Some of them smell. Give me a break.
Babies smell. [ Helicopter Whirring ]
Cover the site! Cover up the dig!
Tell them to shut down! Shut down! Cut the machine!
[ Ellie ] Cover it all up! Pull it over!
Just cut it, will ya?
Cut it out! Shut it down!
What?
What the hell do you think you're doing in here?
[ Cork Pops ] Hey, we were saving that.
[ Scottish Brogue ] For today. I guarantee it.
Who in God's name do you think you are? John Hammond,
and I'm delighted to meet you finally in person, Dr. Grant.
Mr. Hammond-- Well, I can see that my, uh,
50,000 a year has been well spent.
Okay, who's the jerk?
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr.-- Sattler.
Aha! Ellie, this is, uh, Mr. Hammond.
I'm sorry about our dramatic entrance, Dr. Sattler,
but we're in a wee bit of a hurry. Did I say "jerk"?
Will you have a drink? We won't let it get warm. Come along, sit down.
Here, let me-- I'll just get a glass or two.
No, no, no, no. I can manage this.
I know my way around the kitchen.
Now, I'll get right to the point.
Um, I like ya, both of ya.
I can tell instantly about people.
It's a gift.
I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica.
I've leased it from the government,
and I've spent the last five years setting up a kind of biological preserve.
Really spectacular. Spared no expense.
Make the one I've got down in Kenya look like a petting zoo.
And there's no doubt our attractions will drive kids out of their minds.
And what are those? Small versions of adults, honey.
And not just kids, everyone. We're going to open next year.
That is, if the lawyers don't kill me first.
I don't care for lawyers. Do you?
Oh, we, uh, don't know any. I don't really know any.
Well, I do, I'm afraid.
There's a particular pebble in my shoe who represents my investors.
Says that they insist on outside opinions. What kind of opinions?
Well, your kind, not to put too fine a point on it.
I mean, let's face it. In your particular field, you're the top minds.
And if I could just persuade you to sign off on the park,
you know, give it your endorsement,
maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on "shedual," uh, schedule.
Why would they care what we think? What kind of park is this?
It's right up your alley.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you come down, just the pair of ya, for the weekend?
I'd love to have an opinion of a paleobotanist as well.
I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.
Look, I'm sorry. This is impossible. Yeah, we--
We just dug up a new skeleton. I could compensate you by fully funding your dig.
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig.
And this is a very unusual time. The timing is--
For a further three years. Hmm?
where's the plane?
Yeah, okay. Cheers.
Okay. [ Laughing ]

Yo, Dodgson!
You shouldn't use my name.

See? Nobody cares. Nice hat.
What are you tryin' to look like, a secret agent?
Well? 750.
On delivery, 50,000 more for each viable embryo.
That's 1.5 million, if you get all 15 species off the island. [ Laughing ]
Oh, I'll get 'em all. Remember, viable embryos.
They're no use to us if they don't survive.
Oh! How am I supposed to transport them?
The bottom screws open. [ Laughing ]
That's great. Oh, my God.
It's cooled and compartmentalized inside.
Oh, that's great! Customs can even check it if they want to.
Let me see. Oh! Go on.
There's enough coolant inside for 36 hours. No menthol?

Is not. I do wish you wouldn't do that.
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant, you've heard of chaos theory?
No. No? Nonlinear equations?
Strange attractors?
Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you...
Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you... aren't familiar with the concept of attraction.
Hmm! I bring scientists. You bring a rock star.
There it is.
Bad wind shears.
We have to drop pretty fast, so hold on,
because this can be just a little thrilling.
No, no, you need that piece over here, and that piece--
Look, we'll have landed by the time you get it right. Come along.
The full 50 miles of perimeter fence are in place?
And the concrete moats and the motion sensor tracking systems.
Donald, dear boy, relax. Try and enjoy yourself.
Let's get something straight, John.
This is not a weekend excursion.
This is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.
Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.
Forty-eight hours from now, if they're not convinced, I'm not convinced.
I'll shut you down, John. [ Chuckling ]
In 48 hours, I'll be accepting your apologies.
All right, slow down, no closer. Stop, stop, stop!
This shouldn't be here.
Alan, this species of veriforman's been extinct since the Cretaceous Period.
I mean, this thing is humongous. What? What?
Look at that.
Um, it's-- it's a dinosaur. Uh-huh.
You did it.
You crazy son of a bitch, you did.
Oh, Ellie, we can just tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness.
It doesn't apply. They're totally wrong.
This is a warm-blooded creature. This thing doesn't live in a swamp.
This thing's got what, a 25, 27-foot neck?
This thing's got what, a 25, 27-foot neck? - The Brachiosaur, 30. - Thirty feet.
We're gonna make a fortune with this place.
How fast are they?
Well, we clocked the T. rex at 32 miles an hour.
T-- T. rex? Mm-hmm.
You said you've got a T. rex? Uh-huh.
Say again.
We have a T. rex. Oh.
Put your head between your knees. [ Laughing ]
Dr. Grant, my dear Dr. Sattler,
welcome to Jurassic Park.
They're moving in herds.
They do move in herds.
How'd you do this?
I'll show you.
[ Hammond ] G'day, g'day, g'day!
Now, the most advanced amusement park in the entire world,
incorporating all the latest technologies.
And I'm not talking just about rides, you know. Everybody has rides.
No, we've made living biological attractions so astounding...
that they'll capture the imagination of the entire planet.
[ Ellie ] So what are you thinking?
[ Grant ] That we're out of a job.
[ Ian ] Don't you mean "extinct"?
[ Hammond ] Well, now, why don't you all sit down?
Uh, Donald. Sit down, sit down.
Uh, Donald. Sit down, sit down. Ah, here. Here he comes.
Ah, here. Here he comes. Well, here I come. Yes.
Hello, hello. Say hello. Say hello.
Hello, John. Oh, yes, I've got lines.
Well, fine, fine, I guess. But how did I get here?
Uh, uh, well, let me show you.
First, I'll need a drop of blood, your blood. Right. [ Sproing ]
Ooh! John, that hurt.
[ Hammond ] Relax, John, it's all part of the miracle of cloning.
Hello, John. Hello, John.
Hello. [ Grant ] Cloned from what?
Loy extraction has never recreated an intact D.N.A. strand.
Not without massive sequence gaps.
Paleo-D.N.A. from what source?
Where do you get a 100-million-year-old dinosaur blood? [ Donald ] Shhh!
What? What?
Oh, well, Mr. D.N.A. Where did you come from? From your blood.
Just one drop of your blood contains...
billions of strands of D.N.A., the building blocks of life.
A D.N.A. strand like me is a blueprint for building a living thing.
And sometimes, animals that went extinct millions of years ago,
And sometimes, animals that went extinct millions of years ago, like dinosaurs, left their blueprints behind for us to find.
like dinosaurs, left their blueprints behind for us to find.
We just had to know where to look.
100 million years ago, there were mosquitoes, just like today.
And just like today, they fed on the blood of animals, even dinosaurs.
Sometimes, after bitin' a dinosaur,
the mosquito would land on the branch of a tree...
and get stuck in the sap.
After a long time, the tree sap would get hard...
and become fossilized, just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.
This fossilized tree sap, which we call amber,
waited for millions of years with the mosquito inside...
until Jurassic Park scientists came along. Using sophisticated techniques,
Using sophisticated techniques,
they extract the preserved blood from the mosquito,
and bingo-- dino D.N.A.
A full D.N.A. strand contains three billion genetic codes.
If we looked at screens like these once a second for eight hours a day,
it'd take two years to look at the entire D.N.A. strand.
It's that long.
Since it's so old, it's full of holes.
Now that's where our geneticists take over.
Thinkin' machine super-computers and gene sequencers...
break down the strand in minutes.
And virtual-reality displays show our geneticists the gaps in the D.N.A. sequence.
[ Croaking ] We use the complete D.N.A. of a frog to fill in the holes...
and complete the code.
Phew! And now, we can make a baby dinosaur.
[ Hammond ] This score is only temporary.
It all has very dramatic music, of course. Rum-pum-pum!
A march or something. It hasn't been written yet.
And then, of course, the tour moves on. [ Clicks Remote ]
[ Mr. D.N.A. ] Well, lookee here.
Those hard-workin' cowpokes you see behind the glass--
This is overwhelming, John. [ Chuckling ]
Are-- Are these characters, uh, auto-erotica?
No, no, no, we have no animatronics here, no.
Those people are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Those people are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park. [ Mr. D.N.A. ] ...D.N.A. in unfertilized emu or ostrich eggs.
Wait a minute. How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?
Can't we see the unfertilized eggs? Shortly, shortly.
[ Mr. D.N.A. ] Now, a whole team of genetic engineers-- Can't-- Can't you stop these things? I'm sorry. It's kind of a ride.
Can't-- Can't you stop these things? I'm sorry. It's kind of a ride.
Can't-- Can't you stop these things? I'm sorry. It's kind of a ride. One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Uh-- You can't do that.
What? Can they do that?
[ Man On P.A. ] A reminder--
The boat for the mainland will be leaving at 1900 hours.
All personnel be at the dock no later than 1845. No exceptions.
G'day, Henry. Oh, good day, sir.
Oh. It's turning the eggs.
Oh, God. Oh, perfect timing.
I'd hoped they'd hatch before I had to go to the boat.
Henry, Henry, Henry, why didn't you tell me?
I insist on being here when they're born.
[ Hammond ] Come on, come on.
[ Laughing ] Come on, little one.
Come on. [ Squeaking ]
Come on, little one, come on. Come on, then.
Come on, then.
Very good. Push, push.
Very good. [ Ellie ] Oh, God.
Push, come on. [ Ellie Sighing, Laughing ]
Come on, then. Come on, then.
[ Laughing ] There you are. There you are. [ Raspy Breathing, Squealing ] There.
They imprint on the first creature they come in contact with.
That's it. Helps them to trust me. [ Squealing ]
I've been present for the birth...
of every little creature on this island.
Well, surely not the ones that have bred in the wild.
Yes. Actually, they can't breed in the wild.
Population control is one of our security precautions.
There's no unauthorized breeding in Jurassic Park. [ Hammond Laughing ]
How do you know they can't breed?
Well, because all the animals in Jurassic Park are female.
Oh. We've engineered them that way.
There you are.
Oh, my God! Look at that. [ Grant ] Blood temperature seems like high 80's maybe.
[ Grant ] Blood temperature seems like high 80's maybe.
Wu? Uh, 91.
Homeothermic? It holds that temperature? Mm-hmm, yeah.
That's incredible.
But, um, again, how do you know they're all female?
What, does somebody go out in the park and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.
All vertebrate embryos are inherently female anyway.
They require an extra hormone given at the right developmental stage to make them male.
They require an extra hormone given at the right developmental stage to make them male. We simply deny them that.
We simply deny them that.
Deny them that? [ Malcolm ] John, the kind of control...
Deny them that? [ Malcolm ] John, the kind of control... you're attempting is, uh, it's not possible.
you're attempting is, uh, it's not possible.
If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us,
it's that life will not be contained.
Life breaks free-- It expands to new territories...
Life breaks free-- It expands to new territories... and crashes through barriers painfully, maybe even dangerously,
and crashes through barriers painfully, maybe even dangerously, but, uh, well, there it is.
but, uh, well, there it is.
There it is.
You're implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will breed?
No, I'm simply saying that life, uh, finds a way.
What species is this?
Uh, it's a Velociraptor.
You bred raptors?
Dr. Grant, as I was saying,
we laid on lunch for you before you set out into the park.
Our gourmet chef, Alejandro-- What are they doing?
Our gourmet chef, Alejandro-- What are they doing? [ Clanking ] Oh.
[ Mooing ] Feeding them.
Alejandro's, uh, prepared a delightful menu for us. Chilean sea bass, I believe.
Uh, shall we?
They should all be destroyed. [ Hammond Laughing ] Robert. Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.
[ Hammond Laughing ] Robert. Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.
Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, but knows more about raptors than anyone.
What kind of metabolism do they have? What's their growth rate?
They're lethal at eight months, and I do mean lethal.
I've hunted most things that can hunt you, but the way these things move--
Fast for a biped? Cheetah speed.
Fifty, sixty miles per hour, if they ever got out in the open. And they're astonishing jumpers.
Yes, yes, yes, yes. That's why we're taking extreme precautions.
The viewing area is set down below here. Do they show intelligence?
With their brain cavities, we assumed that-- They're extremely intelligent.
Even problem-solving intelligence-- especially the big one. [ Roaring ]
We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride...
and killed all but two of the others.
That one, when she looks at you,
you can see she's working things out.
That's why we have to feed 'em like this.
She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
The fences are electrified, though, right?
That's right, but they never attack the same place twice.
They were testing the fences for weaknesses systematically.
They remember. [ Equipment Whirring, Thudding ]
Yes. Well. Who's hungry?
[ Hammond's Recorded Voice ] More adventurous guests can opt for our jungle river cruise... or for a close-up look at our majestic winged dinosaurs--
or for a close-up look at our majestic winged dinosaurs-- [ Hammond ] None of these attractions are ready yet,
[ Hammond ] None of these attractions are ready yet,
but the park will open with the basic tour you're about to take.
Other rides will come on-line six or twelve months after that.
Absolutely spectacular designs. Spared no expense.
And we can charge anything we want: 2,000 a day, 10,000 a day. And people will pay it.
Then there's the merchandise. I can personally-- [ Hammond ] Donald. Donald.
This park was not built to cater only for the super rich.
Everyone in the world has the right to enjoy these animals. Sure. They will.
We'll have, uh, a coupon day or something. [ Hammond Laughing ]
Gee, the lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here,
Gee, the lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here, um, staggers me.
Well, thank you, Dr. Malcolm, but I think things are a little bit different...
than you and I had feared. Yeah. They're a lot worse.
Now wait a second. We haven't even seen the park yet,
and you-- No, Donald, Donald. Donald, let him talk.
I want to hear every viewpoint. I really do.
I want to hear every viewpoint. I really do. Yeah. Don't you see the danger, uh, John, inherent in what you're doing here?
Yeah. Don't you see the danger, uh, John, inherent in what you're doing here?
Genetic power's the most awesome force the planet's ever seen,
but you wield it like a kid that's found his dad's gun.
-It's hardly appropriate to start hurling generalizations-- -[ Stammering ] If I may.
Um, I'll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you're using here.
Uh, it didn't require any discipline to attain it.
You know, you read what others had done, and you took the next step.
You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves,
so you don't take any responsibility... for it.
You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could,
and before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunch box.
And now-- [ Banging Table ] You're selling it. - You wanna sell it. Well-- - What?
I-I don't think you're giving us our due credit.
Our scientists have done things which nobody's ever done before.
Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could,
they didn't stop to think if they should.
Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction.
No. If I was to-- No, no. If I was to create a flock of condors on this island,
you wouldn't have anything to say.
Hold on. This isn't some species that was obliterated by deforestation...
or the building of a dam.
Dinosaurs, uh, uh, had their shot,
and nature selected them for extinction.
I simply don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.
I mean, how can we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
I mean, how can we stand in the light of discovery and not act? Oh, what's so great about discovery?
Oh, what's so great about discovery?
It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery,
I call the rape of the natural world.
Well, the question is--
How can you know anything about an extinct ecosystem?
And, therefore, how could you ever assume that you can control it?
You have plants in this building that are poisonous.
You picked them because they look good.
But these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're in,
and they'll defend themselves, violently, if necessary.
Dr. Grant, if there's one person here...
who can appreciate what I'm trying to do--
The world has just changed so radically, and we're all running to catch up.
I don't want to jump to any conclusions, but look--
Dinosaurs and man, two species separated by 65 million years of evolution,
Dinosaurs and man, two species separated by 65 million years of evolution, have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together.
have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together.
How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.
You're meant to come down here and defend me against these characters,
and the only one I've got on my side is the bloodsucking lawyer.
Thank you.
Well. They're here.
[ Hammond ] You four are gonna have a spot of company out in the park.
Spend a little time with our target audience.
- Grandpa! - Kids!
[ Grunting ] Wait! Careful with the old man. We miss you.
Thanks for the presents. We loved the presents. They were great.
[ Hammond ] Did you enjoy the helicopter?
[ Girl ] Yeah! It went down, and we all went right up.
[ Hammond ] Now, kids, come away. Not too close to the cars.
[ Laughing ] Aren't they lovely? Aren't they glorious though?
These will be your transports for the afternoon.
[ Donald ] No drivers. No, no, no, no. No drivers.
They're electric. They run on this track in the middle of the roadway.
Totally nonpolluting. Top of the line. Spared no expense.
It's an interactive CD-ROM. Look, see?
You just touch the right part of the screen, and it talks about whatever you want.
Lex, darling, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me. Dr. Grant, come in the second car.
I'm gonna ride with, uh, Dr. Sattler.
I read your book.
Well, that's-- That's great.
Do you really think that dinosaurs turned into birds and that's where they all went?
Well, a few species may have evolved along those lines.
'Cause they sure don't look like birds to me.
I heard that there's this, um, meteor,
hit the earth someplace down in Mexico and made this big crater?
Listen, uh-- Tim.
Tim, which car were you planning on?
Whichever one you are.
Then I heard about this thing in Omni...
about this, um, meteor making all this heat.
And it made diamond dust. That changed the weather, and they died because of the weather.
Then my teacher tells me about this book by a guy named Bakker. He says--
She said I should ride with you because it'd be good for you.
[ Man On P.A. ] The boat is now loading.
Everyone must be on the dock for the 1900-hour departure.
National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm...
about 75 miles west of us. Ay-yi-yi-yi. Why didn't I build in Orlando?
Ay-yi-yi-yi. Why didn't I build in Orlando?
I'll keep an eye on it. Maybe it'll spring south like the last one.
Ray, start the tour program.
[ Sighs ] Hold on to your butts.
[ Tim, Indistinct Chatter ] [ Lex ] And why did they put the fiberglass thing?
[ Lex ] What kind of dinosaurs are we gonna see now?
Hey, lookit! A ghost, a ghost! Aah! [ Lex ] Oh, no. It's driving.
[ Donald Chuckling ] Turn in your fear at the door and join the future, right?
[ Malcolm ] Oh, God help us. We're in the hands of engineers.
[ Tour Guide On Speaker ] During most of your tour, the appropriate information...
will be automatically selected and displayed for you.
[ Tim ] Hey, look! Simply touch the area of the screen displaying...
[ Tim ] Hey, look! Simply touch the area of the screen displaying... the appropriate icon. Are we gonna hit that?
Welcome to Jurassic Park.
[ Malcolm ] What have they got in there, King Kong?
The voice you're now hearing is Richard Kiley.
We spared no expense. [ Tour Guide ] If you look to the right,
you will see a herd of the first dinosaurs on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.
- Dilophosaurus. - Oh, shit!
[ Tour Guide ] One of the earliest carnivores,
we now know Dilophosaurus is actually poisonous,
spitting its venom at its prey, causing blindness and eventually paralysis,
allowing the carnivore to eat at its leisure.
I can't see. This makes Dilophosaurus...
a beautiful but deadly addition...
to Jurassic Park.
Alan-- where?
[ Banging Door ] Damn.
Vehicle headlights are on, and they're not responding.
Those shouldn't be running off the car batteries. Item 151 on today's glitch list.
We have all the problems of a major theme park and a major zoo,
and the computers aren't even on their feet yet.
Dennis, our lives are in your hands, and you have butterfingers?
[ Laughing ] I'm totally unappreciated in my time.
You can run this park from this room with minimal staff for up to three days.
You think that kind of automation is easy?
[ Slurping ] Or cheap?
You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines...
and debug two million lines of code for what I bid for this job?
If you can, I'd love to see him try. I'm sorry...
If you can, I'd love to see him try. I'm sorry... about your financial problems, but they are your problems.
about your financial problems, but they are your problems.
Oh, you're right, John. You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I will not get drawn into another financial debate with you, Dennis.
I really will not. There's been hardly any debate at all.
I don't blame people for their mistakes,
but I do ask that they pay for them.
Thanks, Dad. [ Ray ] Dennis! The headlights.
The headlights. Yeah. I'll debug the tour program when they get back, okay?
Okay? It'll eat a lot of compute cycles. We'll lose part of the system for a while.
There's a finite amount of memory.
There's a finite amount of memory. You gonna compile for half an hour, for crying out loud? Quiet! All of you!
They're approaching the Tyrannosaur paddock.
[ Sighs ] God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs.
God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs.
Dinosaurs...
eat man.
Woman inherits the Earth.
[ Arnold On Speaker ] We'll try to tempt the rex now. Keep watching the fence.
What's gonna happen to the goat?
He's gonna eat the goat? Excellent.
What's the matter, kid? You never had lamb chops?
[ Bleating ] I happen to be a vegetarian.
T. rex doesn't want to be fed. He wants to hunt.
You can't just suppress 65 million years of gut instinct.
Uh, uh, now, eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs...
on your, on your dinosaur tour, right?
Hello? H-Hello.
[ Exhales ] Yes?
I really hate that man.
See, the tyrannosaur, uh, doesn't obey any set patterns or-- or park schedules.
The essence, uh, of chaos.
Um, I'm still not clear on chaos. Wh-What does that mean?
Oh, oh, it simply deals with, uh, unpredictability in complex systems.
The shorthand is the-- the Butterfly Effect.
A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking,
and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
Did I go too fast? I did a fly-by. I missed it.
Give me that glass of water. We're going to conduct an experiment.
It should be still. The car's bouncin' up and down, but that's okay.
It should be still. The car's bouncin' up and down, but that's okay. Now, put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic.
Now, put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic.
Let's say a drop of water falls on your hand.
Which way is the drop going to fall off? Which finger? [ Deep Roar ]
Thumb, I'd say.
Aha. Okay. Now freeze your hand. Don't move.
I'm going to do the same thing, start with the same place again.
Which way is it going to roll off? Let's say back, the same way.
Which way is it going to roll off? Let's say back, the same way. S-Same way. Back the same way.
S-Same way. Back the same way.
[ Gasps ] It changed. It changed. Why? Because tiny variations,
It changed. Why? Because tiny variations,
uh, the orientation of the hairs on your hands-- Hey, Alan, look at this.
Um, the amount of blood distending your vessels, imperfections in the skin--
Imperfections in the skin? Oh, just... microscopic. Microscopic.
And never repeat and vastly affect the outcome.
That's... what? Unpredictability.
[ Malcolm ] Right.
There. Look at this. See?
I'm right again. Nobody could've predicted that Dr. Grant would suddenly,
suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle. Alan?
suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle. Alan? Alan! There's, uh, another example.
Alan! There's, uh, another example.
[ Chuckling ] See, here I'm now by myself, uh, talking to myself.
That's, that's chaos theory.
[ Alarm Beeping ] Stop the program. Stop the program.
[ Beeping ] I told you how many times...
we needed locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors?
[ Man On P.A. ] Stopping ride vehicles and rebooting program.
We're on. Will notify for resume.
We're on. Will notify for resume. [ Keyboard Keys Clicking ] [ Man ] Switch over to check.
[ Keyboard Keys Clicking ] [ Man ] Switch over to check.
[ Man #2 ] We're a full go on that. [ Man #1 ] Looks good.
Like I was saying, there's this other book by a guy named Bakker,
- and he says the dinosaurs died of a bunch of diseases. - [ Ellie ] Where are we going?
You see something?
[ Donald ] Is there anybody else who thinks we shouldn't be out here?
His book was a lot fatter than yours was. Really?
His book was a lot fatter than yours was. Really? Yours was fully illustrated, honey. Hey.
Yours was fully illustrated, honey. Hey.
You okay?
Hey, look at this. Wait. Hey, watch.
Hey, come on. Watch this.
Everybody stay here.
Timmy! Hey, Timmy--
Okay? Of course.
[ Veterinarian ] Don't be scared. It's okay. Muldoon tranquilized her for me.
She's sick.
[ Gasps ] [ Chuckling ] Oh, my God.
[ Laughing ] Hey! Hey, baby. Oh. Oh, God.
Hey, baby girl.
She was my favorite when I was a kid.
Now I see her, she's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
[ Moaning ] It's okay.
Microvesicles. That's interesting.
Thanks. What are her symptoms?
Oh, imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing. Right.
It seems to happen about every six weeks or so. Six weeks.
These are dilated. Take a look. They are?
It's okay. I'll be damned.
That's pharmacological. From local plant life.
Is this West Indian lilac?
[ Veterinarian ] Yes. We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat 'em.
Are you sure? Pretty sure.
There's only one way to be positive.
I'd have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
Dino... droppings, droppings? Yeah.
Yep. Yep. Yeah, I got that.
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course.
We're gonna have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid.
Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off. Are you sure we have to?
Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off. Are you sure we have to? It's not worth taking the chance. Well--
Sustained winds, 45 knots. Tell them when they get back in the cars.
[ Ray ] Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle leaving for the dock...
leaves in approximately five minutes.
Drop what you're doing and leave now.
Damn!
That is one big pile of shit.
You're right. There's no trace of lilac berries.
That's so odd though.
All right, so she's suffering from Melia toxicity...
every six weeks.
[ Distant Thunder Rumbling ] Let's see. Rats. Nada.
Every six weeks. She's, um, tenacious.
You have no idea. [ Ellie Mumbling Indistinctly ]
You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
Doctors, if you please, I have to insist that we get moving.
You know, if it's all right,
I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish up with the trike.
Sure. I'm in a gas-powered jeep.
I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
Great. Then I'll catch up with you if you want to go on.
You sure? Yeah. I wanna stay with her a little longer.
Okay, then. Okay.
[ Donald ] Now!
There's nothing I can do. The captain says we gotta go, we gotta go!
You gotta give me the time. I did a test run on this thing. It took me 20 minutes.
I could maybe push it to 18, but you gotta give me at least 15 minutes.
No promises!
[ Ray ] Visitor vehicles are returning to the garage.
[ Sighing ] So much for our first tour. Two no-shows and one sick Triceratops.
Two no-shows and one sick Triceratops.
It could've been worse, John. A lot worse.
[ Dennis ] Anybody want a soda or something?
I'm going to the machine. I thought, you know, maybe I'd get somebody something.
I've had only sweets, and I'm gonna get something salty.
I thought maybe somebody would, uh--
Oh, I finished debugging the phones. I was gonna debu-- So I did.
You told me to, uh, so I debugged the phones.
And I thought maybe, uh-- Oh, I should tell you the system is gonna be compiling...
for, uh, 18 to 20 minutes.
Some of the monitor systems might go on or off, but it's nothing to worry about.
It's just a simple thing.
You got any kids? Me? Oh, oh, hell, yeah, three.
You got any kids? Me? Oh, oh, hell, yeah, three. I love kids. Hmm.
Anything at all can and does happen.
Same with wives, for that matter. You married?
Same with wives, for that matter. You married? Occasionally. Uh, yeah--
I'm-I'm always on the lookout for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.
Five, four, three, two, one.
[ Arnold ] That's odd.
[ Hammond ] What? Door security systems are shutting down.
Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
By the way, Dr. Sattler, um, she's not, like, available, is she?
Why? Yeah, I'm sorry.
Why? Yeah, I'm sorry. You two are, uh-- Yeah.
You two are, uh-- Yeah.
[ Metallic Squeaking ] Hey, what'd I touch?
Uh, you didn't touch anything. We stopped.
Whoa, whoa. What the hell? What the hell?
What now? Fences are failing all over the park.
Find Nedry! Check the vending machines.
Look at this workstation. What a complete slob.
The raptor fences aren't out, are they?
[ Computer Beeping ] No, no. They're still on.
Why the hell would he turn the other ones off?
[ Arnold ] Access main program. Access main security.
[ Computer Beeping ] Access main program grid.
[ Nedry On Computer ] Uh, uh, uh! You didn't say the magic word.
Uh, uh, uh! Uh, uh, uh! Please! Goddamn it! I hate this hacker crap! Call Nedry's people in Cambridge.
I hate this hacker crap! Call Nedry's people in Cambridge.
[ Nedry ] Uh, uh, uh! Phones are out too.
Where did the vehicles stop?
Their radio's out too. Gennaro said to stay put.
Kids okay? I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?
Kids get scared. What's to be scared about? It's just a little hiccup in the power. I didn't say I was scared.
It's just a little hiccup in the power. I didn't say I was scared.
I didn't say you were scared. I know.
Hey, where did you find those? Under my seat.
Are they heavy? Yeah!
Then they're expensive. Put 'em back.
Don't scare me.
[ Tim ] Oh, cool. Night vision.
[ Indistinct Booming Noise ] Do you feel that?
Maybe it's the power tryin' to come back on.
[ Booming Noise Continues ] What is that?
[ Panting ] Where's the goat?
Oh, Jesus!
[ Whispering ] He left us. He left us.
Where does he think he's going?
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
[ Panting ] Dr. Grant?
Boy, do I hate being right all the time.
Keep absolutely still. Its vision is based on movement.
Turn the light off. Turn the light off.
Turn the light off!
Turn-- Turn it off! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! [ Indistinct Shouting ]
- Hey-hey! Hey-hey! - Ian, freeze!
Get the kids! Get rid of the flare!
Get the kids! Get rid of the flare!
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord be with thee--
Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant! [ Crying ] Okay, Lex, I got you.
[ Grunting ] I'm stuck! The seat's got my feet!
I'll get you next. You're okay. [ Muttering ]
Come on. Good. You're all right. Tim! Tim?
Don't move. He can't see us if we don't move.
This way-- No, no, wait!
Lex! Lex! You're chokin' me.
Grab the wire! [ Grunting ]
"Keycheck space minus O, keychecks off, safety space minus O."
He's turning the safety systems off. He doesn't want anybody to see what he's about to do.
He's turning the safety systems off. He doesn't want anybody to see what he's about to do. Look at this next entry. It's the kicker. "White rabbit object."
Look at this next entry. It's the kicker. "White rabbit object."
It did it all, but with the keychecks off, the computer didn't file the keystrokes.
The only way to find them is to go through the computer's lines of code one by one.
How many lines of code are there? About two million.
Two million? Yeah.
Robert, I-- I wonder if perhaps you would be good enough...
to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
Sure.
I'm going with him.
John. John? [ Nedry On Computer ] The magic word, the magic word--
I can't get Jurassic Park back online without Dennis Nedry.
Should have been there by now.
No damn good.
Oh, damn!
There's the road.
Winch this sucker off the thing, and then I tie it to that thing there, and then I...
pull down this thing here and I--
My glasses! I can afford more glasses.
Oh, geez!
You got time, you got time. You can do it!
You can do it. Come on, Dennis!
Hello?
Ha! Yeah, yeah, that's nice. Gotta go.
Oh. Ah, nice boy. Nice boy! Nice dinosaur.
Nice dinosaur.
I thought you were one of your big brothers. You're not so bad.
What do you want? You want food? Look at me.
I just fell down a hill. I'm soakin' wet. I don't have any food.
I have no food on me. I have nothing on me.
Play fetch? Play fetch?
Look, see? See stick?
See stick? Yeah, look, stick.
Look, stick. Stick, stupid. Fetch the stick, boy.
You like the stick? [ Squealing ]
No wonder you're extinct.
I'm gonna run you over when I come back down.
Now, Lex, listen, listen to me. I'm right here.
I'm gonna look after you, but I have to go help your brother.
So I want you to stay right here and wait for me.
He left us. He left us!
But that's not... what I'm gonna do.
Okay?
Stay here.
Timmy?
Tim?
You hear me? I'm coming up.
I hate climbing. I hate trees. Way too high.
Oh, goddamn tree.
Hey, Tim?
Tim?
Tim.
You okay? You okay?
I threw up.
Oh. Oh, that's okay.
Just give me your hand.
Hey, Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up.
Just, just give me your hand.
Here, I gotcha. Come on. Okay.
That's good. Over the wheel. Don't pull me too hard.
That's good. Over the wheel. Don't pull me too hard. No hurry. [ Truck Creaking ]
Stand on the door. Hang on to me.
Okay, I got you. Okay.
Okay, that's not too bad, right, Tim? Yes, it is.
Just like coming out of a tree house. Did your dad ever build you a tree house?
No. Yeah, me too.
The thing about climbing is you never, never look down. This is impossible.
How am I gonna do this? It's about 50-- 50 feet-- I'm gonna help you--
Oh, no. Tim, go!
Oh! Go, go, go! Go, Tim, go!
Faster, Tim!
Tim, jump!
Go, Tim.
[ Tim ] Well, we're back... in the car again.
[ Grant ] Well, at least you're out of the tree.
Where's the other car? Where's the other car?
Alan! Dr. Grant!
[ Screaming ] Alan!
Grant!
I think this was Gennaro. I think this was too.
[ Roaring ] I think it's ahead of us.
It could be anywhere. With the fences down, it can wander in and out of any paddock it likes.
He put a tourniquet on. Ian. Ian!
Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend.
Can we chance moving him? [ Roaring Continues ]
Please chance it.
[ Roaring ] Ellie, come on! Wait, wait.
The other car!
[ Muldoon ] Dr. Grant?
[ Sobbing ] Alan!
They're not here.
Anybody hear that?
It's a, um-- It's an impact tremor is what it is.
I'm fairly alarmed here.
Come on, come on, come on. We gotta get outta here. Now, now! Right now! Go, go, go! Let's go!
Go, go, go! Let's go!
Start the engine!
Must go faster. [ Roaring ]
Here it comes! Fifth gear! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Get off the stick! Bloody move!
Look out! Down!
Think they'll have that on the tour?
Are you hearing this?
Come on, Tim. Come on, hurry up.
Let's, uh, get up this tree. Oh, no.
Come on, Tim, it's okay. Try up here. I don't want to.
Okay. Oh, man.
I hate trees. They don't bother me.
Oh, yeah, well, you weren't in the last one.
Hey, those are Brontosauruses. I mean, uh, Brachiosaurs.
Hey, those are Brontosauruses. I mean, uh, Brachiosaurs. [ Moaning ] They're singing.
[ Moaning ] They're singing.
Don't let the monsters come over here. They're not monsters, Lex.
They're just animals. These are herbivores.
That means they only eat vegetables, but for you I think they'd make an exception.
Tim. Oh, I hate the other kind.
The other kind just... do what they do.
[ Whispering ] What is that?
What are you and Ellie gonna do now if you don't have to pick up dinosaur bones anymore?
I don't know. I guess... we'll just have to evolve too.
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
I don't know. What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Do-you-think-he-saurus.
What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog? You got me.
A do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
[ Chuckling ] Alan? Yeah? What if the dinosaurs come back while we're all asleep?
Yeah? What if the dinosaurs come back while we're all asleep?
Well, I'll stay awake.
All night?
All night.
They were all melting.
Malcolm's okay for now. I gave him a shot of morphine.
They'll be fine.
Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
You know the first...
attraction I ever built when I came down from Scotland...
was a flea circus, Petticoat Lane.
Really quite wonderful.
We had, uh, a wee trapeze and, uh,
a merry-go--
a merry-go-- A carousel. Huh.
And a seesaw.
They all move, motorized, of course, but, uh, people would say they could see the fleas.
"Oh, I can see the fleas, Mummy. Can't you see the fleas?"
Clown fleas and high-wire fleas and fleas on parade.
But with this place,
I wanted to show them something that wasn't an illusion.
Something that was real.
Something that they could...
see and touch.
An aim not devoid of merit.
But you can't think through this one, John. You have to feel it.
[ Chuckling ] You're right. You're absolutely right.
Hiring Nedry was a mistake. That's obvious. We're overdependent on automation.
I can see that now. Now, the next time, everything's correctable.
I can see that now. Now, the next time, everything's correctable. John. Creation...
John. Creation...
is an act of sheer will.
Next time, it'll be flawless.
It's still the flea circus. It's all an illusion.
When we have control again-- You've never had control. That's the illusion.
I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.
But I made a mistake too.
I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.
The only thing that matters now... are the people we love.
Alan and Lex and Tim.
John, they're out there where people are dying.
So--
It's good.
Spared no expense.
Go away! It's okay, it's okay. It's a Brachiosaur.
It's a Veggie-saurus, Lex, Veggie-saurus.
Veggie. [ Tim Imitating Brachio Moan ] Come on, come on, girl.
Come on. Come on, baby.
Yo! All right!
Yo! All right! I'm not letting go! [ Chuckling ]
Looks like it has a cold. Yeah, maybe.
Can I touch it? Sure.
Just think of it as... kind of a big cow.
[ Lex ] I like cows.
Hey, come on, girl. Come on up here, girl.
Come on, up here. [ Sneezing ]
God bless you!
Yuck! Oh, great, now she'll never try anything new.
She'll just sit in her room and never come out and play on her computer.
I'm a hacker. That's what I said. You're a nerd.
I am not a computer nerd. I prefer to be called a hacker.
[ Whispering ] Oh, God.
You know what this is?
It's a dinosaur egg.
The dinosaurs... are breeding.
But my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Amphibian D.N.A. What's that?
Well, on the tour, the film said they used...
frog D.N.A. to fill in the gene sequence gaps.
frog D.N.A. to fill in the gene sequence gaps. They mutated the dinosaur genetic code...
and blended it with that of frogs.
Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex...
from male to female in a single sex environment.
Malcolm was right. Look.
Life found a way.
[ Arnold ] No, no, no, that's crazy. You're out of your mind.
[ Ellie ] Wait a minute, what exactly would this mean?
We're talking about a calculated risk, which is about the only option left to us.
We will never find the command that Nedry used. He's covered his tracks far too well.
I think it's obvious now that he's not coming back.
So, shutting down the entire system--
You can get somebody else, because I won't do it.
You can get somebody else, because I won't do it. Shutting down the system is the only way to wipe out everything that he did.
Shutting down the system is the only way to wipe out everything that he did.
Now, as I understand it, all the systems will then come back...
on their original start-up mode, correct?
Theoretically, yes. But we've never shut down the entire system before.
It may not come back on at all. Will we get the phones?
It may not come back on at all. Will we get the phones? Yes, again, in theory.
Yes, again, in theory.
What about the lysine contingency?
We could put that into effect. What's that?
That is absolutely out of the question.
The lysine contingency is intended to prevent the spread of the animals...
in case they ever get off the island.
Dr. Wu inserted a gene that creates a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.
The animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.
Unless they're completely supplied with lysine by us, they slip into a coma and die.
People... are... dying.
Will you please shut down the system?
Hold on to your butts.
It's okay. Look. See that?
It's on. It worked.
Wait a minute. What do you mean, it worked? Everything's still off.
Maybe the shutdown tripped the circuit breakers.
All we have to do is turn them back on, reboot a few systems--
telephones, security doors, half a dozen others-- but it worked.
System's ready. Where are the breakers?
Maintenance shed, the other end of the compound.
Three minutes, I can have power back on in the entire park.
Just to be safe, I want everybody in the emergency bunker...
until Mr. Arnold returns, and the whole system is running again.
I'm tired. I'm hot. I'm dirty. My legs hurt.
Just keep going, guys. We have a map.
It says the visitors center is just about a mile over that rise there.
Just... keep--
What is that?
Tim. Tim, can you tell me what they are?
Gr-- Ga, uh, uh, Galla--
Uh, Gallimimus.
Are-- Are those, um, meat-eating?
Um, meat-asauruses?
Look at the wheeling. Uniform direction changes.
Just like a flock of birds evading a predator.
They're, uh-- They're flocking this way.
I wanna go now. Look how it eats.
Please. I bet you never look at birds the same way again.
Yes. Go now.
Okay. Keep low and follow me.
Look how much blood.
Oh, God. Something went wrong.
Something's happened.
Something's wrong.
[ Hammond ] This is just a delay.
All major theme parks have delays.
When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked. John.
But, John, if the Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down,
the pirates don't eat the tourists. I can't wait anymore.
Something went wrong. I'm gonna go get the power back on.
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
Don't let's be too hasty. He's only been gone--
- I'm going with you. - Okay.
[ Exhales ] Sorry.
This isn't going to be just like switching on the kitchen light,
but I think I can follow this and then talk you through it.
Right.
But, uh, it ought to be me really going.
Why? Well, I'm a-- And you're, um--
- Look. - Come on. Let's go.
We can discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.
You just take me through this step-by-step. I'm on channel two.
Right.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences.
Damn it. Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fences.
Come on, this way.
[ Sighs ] I can see the shed from here.
We can make it if we run.
No. We can't.
Why not?
Because we're being hunted.
Oh, God.
From the bushes, straight ahead.
It's all right. Like hell it is.
Run. Towards the shed.
I've got her.
Go! Now!
Mr. Arnold?
Mr. Arnold? John, I'm in.
Great. Now,
ahead of you is a metal staircase.
Go down it. Okay. Going down.
After 20 or 30 feet, you come to a T-junction. Take a left.
After 20 or 30 feet, you come to a T-junction. Take a left. Have her follow the main cable. I understand how to read a schematic.
Have her follow the main cable. I understand how to read a schematic.
I guess that means the power's off.
That's not funny. That was great.
Well, maybe, we could--
Damn it. Dead end.
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. There should have been a right turn back there somewhere.
There should have been a right turn back there somewhere.
Ellie, look above you.
There should be a large bundle of cable and pipes all heading in the same direction.
There should be a large bundle of cable and pipes all heading in the same direction. - Follow that. - Okay. Following the piping.
- Follow that. - Okay. Following the piping.
Timmy, I bet I could climb over the top...
and be on the other side before you could get to the top.
What would you give me? Respect.
Come on, guys. It's not a race.
I see the box. It says "high voltage."
Yeah. Okay. Okay.
Good. Here we go. Over the top.
Take your time, Tim. That's good. Come on.
[ Grant ] Find your footing. Find your footing.
Ellie, you can't throw the main switch by hand.
You've got to pump up the primer handle in order to get the charge.
It's large, flat and gray.
All right, here I go. Okay?
One, two, three, four.
Okay. Charged.
Under the words "contact position,"
there's a round, green button which says, "push to close."
"Push to close." Okay.
Push it.
Now, Ellie, the red buttons turn on the individual park systems.
Switch 'em on.
Timmy! You're gonna have to jump! Get down now!
You crazy? I'm not gonna jump.
Do what Dr. Grant says! Let go! I'll count to three! One,
two, three!
Control room. Tour.
I'm coming up. I'm coming up to get you. Lex, I've gotta get Tim.
Okay. I'm gonna count to three.
One,
two-- [ Fence Buzzes ]
Timmy! Timmy!
He's not breathing.
Mr. Hammond, I think we're back in business.
Goddamn!
Oh, Mr. Arnold.
- [ Hissing ] - Clever girl.
Tim!
No, Tim!
Good boy, good boy. [ Coughing Continues ]
Good boy, good boy, Tim.
Three. [ Wheezing ]
[ Grant ] Hello?
Okay. I'm gonna have to find the others,
get you to a doctor.
Lex, you look after Tim. Hey! Yeah.
Your hair is all sticking up.
Big Tim, the human piece of toast.
I'll be back soon. I promise.
- Run. - Ellie!
It's just the two raptors, right?
You sure the third one's contained? Yes.
You sure the third one's contained? Yes. Unless they figure out how to open doors.
[ Lex Whispering ] Timmy, what is it?
It's a Velociraptor.
It's inside.
[ Gasping ] Follow me.
It's in there.
Control room.
[ Lex ] We can call for help?
We gotta reboot the system first. [ Computer Beeps ]
The door locks!
Ellie, boot up the door locks!
- [ Gasping ] - No, boot up the door locks!
Ellie, get back! Boot up the door locks!
You can't hold it by yourself! [ Raptor Squealing ]
It's a UNIX system. I know this.
It's all the files of the whole park. It tells you everything.
Um, I gotta find the right file.
[ Growling ] Try to reach the gun!
I can't get it unless I move.
[ Lex ] Oh, this is it. This might be the right file.
Wait. This-- This isn't the right file.
Come on, Lex! Oh!
- [ Beeps ] - [ Gasps ]
You got it? Yes!
- [ Beeping ] - [ Tim ] You got it!
Yes! Yes, this is it! Yes!
[ Grant ] What works? Phones, security systems. You name it, we got it.
- Grant? - Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.
The children all right? The children are fine.
Call the mainland. Tell 'em to send the damn helicopters.
- [ Crashing ] - [ Ellie ] It's gonna come through the glass! [ Gunshots ] What?
Grant!
Move! Quickly! Tim, move!
- [ Lex Screams ] - Tim, let go. Yeah. - [ Screaming ] - [ Grunts ]
Hold on to me! Mr. Hammond!
After careful consideration, I've decided...
After careful consideration, I've decided... not to endorse your park. So have I.
It's okay. It's okay.
...your ass has gotten bigger."
I'm sorry, sir. This cabin is restricted to first class.
Are you looking for this?
Can I get you anything?
Scotch. Blended. Straight.
This is your captain speaking.
We've got a report of some turbulence ahead.
Please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts...
...and remain there until we release the fasten-seat-belt sign.
I hear birds can't fly this high.
I hear only angels can.
Where's the bomb?
I am the bomb.
-Shall I pour your Scotch? -No, I'll take the bottle.
Another movie from an old TV show.
What are you gonna do?
Walk out.
Very funny.
No, it isn't.
What are you doing?!
What are you doing?! Get off of me!
Help me! Help me!
Help me! Be careful!
Nice flight?
You crazy bastard!
I think you mean "crazy bitch."
What is this? What's going on here?
Damn, I hate to fly.
No way! No way!
What's with that?! Who are you people?!
Who are you people?!
Once upon a time, there were three very different little girls...
...who grew up to be three very different women.
--making her a five-day champion. Way to go, Natalie.
They have three things in common: They're brilliant, beautiful...
I'm going to be all over you!
You will be kissing my ass--
...and they work for me.
My name is Charlie.
-Let's go this way. -No!
This way!
Wait. I'm not a yo-yo!
Good morning, Starfish.
Good morning, Chad.
Sweet Chad.
I figured we could have a little breakfast.
And then, maybe, after...
...we could have a little Chad.
Hold that thought.
Yes, I'll be right in.
Isn't that just the luck?
I can make something besides eggs.
No, it's not the eggs.
Is it the boat?
It's not the boat. I have to go.
Is it the Chad?
It might be the Chad.
It's the Chad!
It's the Chad!
Eduardo, move me.
Good morning.
I signed the waiver, so feel free to stick things in my slot.
Thanks.
No problem.
Hey! I'll be right in.
I want to get one thing straight between us.
Go ahead. We're past keeping secrets at this point.
This is going to be long...
...hard and rough.
Sometimes when it's rough, I just get there faster.
If you don't defuse this bomb, L.A. will be an underwater attraction.
Which wire? The red one or the blue one?
That is not helping.
My muffins.
This is stupid, anyway. Why wouldn't I just yank the wire?
They're dummy wires, honey. The real mechanism is inside.
Trip the external feedback circuit, the bomb will detonate.
For a bikini waxer, you know a lot about bombs.
Isn't it amazing how much information you can learn off the Internet?
I'll be right there.
When do I get to meet this Charlie?
Charlie's not a very social person.
But Charlie's a chick though, right?
I mean, definitely a woman, right?
I can't keep up this façade with Jason anymore.
Who wants a man who's intimidated by a strong woman?
They come on nice until they find out I can shatter a block with my head.
I love that trick.
Blueberry muffins.
I made them from scratch.
Yum.
Sounds good.
These look great, Alex.
Oh, my God.
What's this?
Chinese fighting muffin.
Nothing to laugh about.
My buddy took a fighting muffin in the chest, went home in four Ziploc bags.
They're not Chinese. They're not fighting. They're blueberry.
Are you okay?
She's having secret-identity trouble.
Aren't we all?
Scoot.
Alex...
...all my Angels...
...the heart is a muscle.
In bodybuilding, we exercise the muscle...
...and it grows bigger and stronger.
It's the same with the heart.
I must have the heart of a rhino.
You do. Be proud of it.
Mes Anges...
...these little hurts will heal.
And at crunch time, your hearts will be so buff...
...you'll be able to clean and jerk his love...
...three sets, 10 reps each.
Thanks, Bos.
Excuse me. I have to take a phone call.
Good morning, Angels.
Good morning, Charlie.
Dylan, Alex, Natalie, I hope you're ready for your next assignment.
Meet Eric Knox, a brilliant engineer and founder of Knox Technologies...
...an up-and-coming communications software company.
Last night, Knox was kidnapped...
...and his voice-identification software was stolen.
Who's the lady?
Vivian Wood, president of Knox Technologies.
Oh, she did it.
I guess we can all go home then.
Angels, meet Vivian Wood, our new client.
She's hired us to find Eric Knox.
Hello.
Who'd have the most to gain from Knox's disappearance?
Me, probably. I'm his partner.
Before we were partners...
...we were friends.
Does Knox have any enemies?
Roger Corwin. He's owner...
...of Red Star, the largest communications satellite firm.
Six months ago, he tried to buy Knox Technologies.
When Knox refused to sell, Corwin lost it.
Charming.
Was there a ransom demand?
Nothing. But I know he's still alive.
I'll study the garage footage. Something may be there.
So Corwin is our only lead. Hopefully, he'll take us to Knox.
Corwin gets a weekly massage at Madame Wong's House of Blossoms.
That's our chance to feel him out.
He said what?
"Over my dead body"?
I can accept those terms.
It's getting a little chilly in here, Yoko. I could use some warming up.
At your service.
Good.
Could we get started this millennium?
Banzai!
Yeah.
You're holding a lot of tension...
...in your 4th and 5th vertebrae.
I know.
Let me see if I can work that...
...out.
By activating the right energy points, you can increase circulation...
...alleviate pain...
...or even...
...render a man unconscious.
Okay, let's go.
Palm Pilot.
Got the car key.
I got his schedule.
You must have dozed off.
You're very good...
...with your hands.
I could use someone like you on my staff.
Thanks for the offer, but my hands aren't going anywhere near your staff.
If Corwin is behind Knox's disappearance...
...someone else is doing his dirty work.
How's it coming with the kidnapping footage?
I'm enhancing a reflection from the car window.
May I take your order?
Three cheeseburgers, three french fries and three cherry pies.
What do you guys want?
Here's one of the kidnappers.
Creepy Thin Man.
Now we just look for him.
And see if he works for Corwin.
What's Corwin doing tonight?
Who's up for crashing a party?
Bos.
-Thanks, Nat. -No problem.
It's a mic-transmitter. Put it on your back molar.
I know. It's a mouth-mic.
We'll be able to always stay in touch.
We're in deep cover now, so if...
...you can't remember John David, just call me J.D. Think of....
-Jelly doughnut. -Jack Daniel's.
-Juvenile delinquents. -John DeLorean.
There's your date, J.D.
Excuse me, ladies.
Roger Corwin. Welcome.
John David Rage, self-help guru.
John David Rage?
Relax, Bos. Order a drink.
Excuse me. Miss?
-Hi. -Hi, miss.
-A hammerhead, please. -No problem.
Any creepy thin men?
Lots of creepy, none thin.
-I was wondering if-- -No.
-So there's no chance-- -No.
That's incredible.
What is?
Your smile.
Thanks.
This place, it's Japanese, is it not?
It's a 13th-century Shinto temple.
I had it....
I had it FedEx'd from Kyoto.
Blowfish?
Isn't that poisonous?
It's a rare delicacy for the man who has no fear of an excruciating death.
Technically, 1 in 60 is fatal.
Tastes like chicken.
That would go very nicely with broccoli.
The man laughs at death.
Good work, Bos. Get him to talk about Knox.
At last, a worthy adversary.
Let's see if you can survive a test of intuition and judgment.
Nat, that bartender is cute.
I'm working.
He likes you. Go back and flirt a little.
That was fast.
I'm not called Balls-Out Natalie for nothing.
Right.
I never saw you working here before.
I'm new. I'm like a virgin. I mean, it's my first time...
...here at Corwin's.
Oh, boy. She's going down.
No way. He's into her.
Just pick up the tray and walk away.
No, no. Stay. Stay and talk to him.
-Flip your hair. -What?
Flip your goddamn hair.
Excuse me. I don't usually do this, but I was wondering--
Unless you're already seeing someone else.
-Yeah. -Of course you are.
-Yeah. -Of course you are. No! I'm not seeing anyone.
No! I'm not seeing anyone.
Free.
Okay, Thursday?
My favorite day.
Great. I'll get tickets.
I love tickets.
What do you know? A guy who speaks Natalie.
Where's J.D.?
Will somebody help me up, please?
Hello, girls? Are you hearing me?
Thin Man, 10 o'clock.
Why do they always run?
Watch it!
Nat!
-Brace! -Jump!
Check them all!
-Clear! -Clear!
Clear!
Knox.
Great work, Angels, but our job's only half-finished.
There's still the matter of Mr. Knox's stolen technology.
What's so special about your software?
It's.... It's really quite amazing.
We developed a program. You see, everyone's voice is unique.
It has a unique signature...
...like a snowflake. And it can be mapped--
Audio DNA. It makes it impossible to disguise or scramble a voice signal.
Which is why Corwin wants it.
Of course. All Red Star's satellites have global positioning systems.
Combine that with voice identification--
Any cell phone could be a homing device.
No one could hide.
Imagine how dangerous this would be in the wrong hands.
The end of privacy.
That's where you come in, Angels.
Corwin is premiering his Red Star racer at the California Speedway.
Our chance to plant a hidden camera on Corwin.
Looks like it's off to the races, Angels.
When Roger Corwin first got involved in the world of racing...
...a lot of people said it was a stopgap for my waning libido.
I had them all fired.
What's so funny? I did.
Thanks for coming to this little test run.
Nat...
...I'm going in.
But what can I say?
It's a Red Star day for me.
Then it's back to the day-to-day grind...
...of world domination and enslavement.
Hi.
Work your magic.
It's hot out there.
It's hot in here too.
Maybe I can make you more comfortable.
I've come undone.
That feels good.
Thank you.
I like what you've done with it.
Ours has bigger mirrors.
I love cars.
Do you like fast cars?
I like fast everything.
Oh, my God.
Thanks for the ride.
You're welcome.
Mission accomplished. Tomorrow, Corwin will give us a tour of Red Star.
Ride 'em, cowboy. Make me proud.
Nat!
What's going on?
We got a friend on the track.
That creep from Chinatown.
Creepy Thin Man.
It's a round track. He's not going anywhere.
She's going after him.
The microcamera has allowed us to study Red Star's layout.
The mainframe is right behind that door.
That's where my software would be, but the security looks incredible.
-Restricted access. -Fingerprint ID.
Retinal scanner.
Angels, break it down.
Only two Red Star directors can access the mainframe.
To gain access, they have to synchronize their entrance.
A gelatin scanning plate takes exact fingerprints.
A laser accurate to .009 millimeters scans the retina.
It is accessible only through a monitored airless antechamber.
There's only one way to get through undetected: Be invisible.
The floor is rigged with pressure sensitivity.
Any contact exceeding .25 seconds triggers the alarm.
Sounds impossible.
Sounds like fun.
Mein Siegenbock ist sexy!
They got the wrong address.
You ready to whip them into shape, Alex?
You must be Miss Aarons. I'm Doris.
Sorry about the confusion.
I had you scheduled for next week. I don't know what happened.
That's what I'm here to find out.
You are the efficiency expert.
Yes.
I am.
Bitch.
I heard that.
Your methodologies are antiquated and weak.
Your procedures of approval ensure that only the least radical ideas...
...are rewarded.
Meanwhile, your competition is innovating!
You.
What was the last suggestion you made?
To make the Coke machine free.
Why?
Caffeine helps us program.
Perfect. Smart...
...simple and logical.
What did your boss say?
He said no.
Question!
Who builds this company's products?
You do.
Engineers do.
Not managers.
They should be answering to you, not you to them!
Who else has an idea like this man's Coke machine?
All right! Tell me.
Better yet...
...can anyone show me?
It's not working.
There's only one way to get through undetected: Be invisible.
The floor is rigged with pressure sensitivity.
Any contact which exceeds .25 seconds will trigger the alarm.
Thank you, sir.
I hope you don't mind if we look around.
So we have complete access to Red Star's computer.
And they have no idea we can peek inside.
You guys are tremendous. Thanks.
I need evidence of Knox Technologies software in the Red Star system.
-Where is it? -Bosley has it in the laptop.
It has a direct link to the Red Star mainframe.
Bosley?
Maybe we should be doing our own analysis.
Surely Eric would be the best person to--
Our goal was to learn if Red Star had stolen your software.
It would be unethical to let you access their systems.
If we get proof, we'll tell you.
That makes sense. That's cool. Right?
Right, Viv?
You know, Knox may not be out of danger yet.
Smile. Don't panic the client.
One of us should check security at his house.
Absolutely. I agree.
-Everything okay? -Yeah. Nothing up here.
Wow, that was cool.
Who's the Green Beret?
My dad.
That's nice.
That's the guy who killed him.
Yeah. They were in Army Intelligence together.
This was his best friend and he turned on him.
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Why do you keep it?
To remind me: Be careful who you trust. Don't take any wooden nickels.
What about you? Did you ever have parents?
I mean-- I know you have parents, but I mean--
Where's your mom?
She died when I was 6, and I never met my father.
You never met your father?
Now you work for...
...a man you've never seen.
That's an interesting trend.
That was smooth.
Want to play Scrabble?
Don't worry about it. I got somebody--
That's okay.
What are they called? You know....
So, okay.
-This is a panic button. -Okay.
If you just press it, then any one of us...
...whoever's closest, will be here if there's any problem.
Like that? Okay. Right now, that would be you.
But you don't have a problem.
Yeah, I do.
I don't know...
...how to make chicken.
Scrabble?
Shake 'N Bake?
I'll shake, you bake?
I want to shake.
-Hey, Pete. -How's it going?
-Good. How are you? -Good. It's good to see you.
-You want your ticket? -All right!
-Thanks for giving me a chance. -I wanted to see you.
-Really? -Yeah.
-You look great. -Thank you.
I've thought a lot about us.
No, no, no. I know you have something to say...
...but I have something to say too.
I've been thinking a lot about you and me and, well, us.
And I know that we have these crazy lives, but I can't help it.
I love you.
Searching Red Star mainframe for Knox Technologies software.
Software not detected.
Coming.
Hello.
Trick-or-treat for UNICEF.
That's a very nice costume, young lady.
It glows in the dark.
I hope you like to dance.
Are you kidding? I love to dance!
You. You want to dance on-stage?
-Us? -Yes!
No, the stage is for the ladies.
Oh, never mind. I'll just find a spot on the floor.
No, no, wait.
This is Soul Train's highest honor.
I won't let you not go up there. Yeah, she'll go.
Really? I've always wanted to go up there!
Have a great time.
Okay. I'll be back.
Ms. Wood, there are some lines that I never cross.
Lines have never stopped me.
It's "Miss." And it's "Vivian."
Okay. Miss Vivian.
Okay, Miss Vivian. You're a pro.
I mean, you're not a pro, but you're an executive.
We must keep our relationship professional.
May I?
I'll get you a glass.
She's pretty great, isn't she?
I said, she's pretty great, right?
You guys are in really good shape.
Definitely. Definitely.
All right. The Robot!
Go, white girl! Go, white girl!
That's old school, right? Definitely.
I'm Pete. How are you?
The Running Man! Look!
Incredible! It was great!
I'm having so much fun! This is so exciting!
You know, I have to go number one.
Look...
...what I'm trying to say is...
...will you marry me?
Oh, no, baby! Baby?!
Baby?! God, no.
Damn you, Salazar.
Damn you, Salazar!
Cut!
Was that over the top? It felt over the top.
No. That is the best shot, the best scene, the best movie on the planet!
Hi.
How was your day? Great.
You know how superheroes have these secret identities, where they--
No. No superheroes.
You're an action star. I get a lot of action.
That is so lame.
Hey, girls, you having fun?
I'm having so much fun I could just die.
Jason, I'm one-third of an elite crime-fighting team...
...backed by an anonymous millionaire.
Yes, that's it.
What are you doing here?
Perfect.
Come on! Go! Hit it!
Murphy O'Meyer...
...that does it.
Who sent you?
Who?!
Woo-- Woo--
-Who? -Woo--
-Vivian-- -Spit it out!
Vivian Wood!
You bitch.
I love a fire.
Hey.
Oh, my God! You're hit!
No. I mean, the squibs hurt a bit when they go off, but I'm fine.
What happened to my trailer?
I haven't been honest with you.
Were you in there when that happened? Look at it.
I'm not a bikini waxer.
Bummer. I mean, that was kind of a turn-on.
I have to go.
-Charlie? -Yeah.
I have to go, but will you call me tomorrow?
-Of course. -Great. Thanks.
Excuse me.
You're bad.
Guys, finally you warm up a bit.
Dylan? It's Nat. Vivian Wood is a fake and an all-around bitch.
Her assassin just paid me a visit. We gotta warn Knox.
I'm at his house now.
You are?
You know what?
Call Alex and meet me at the agency.
Dylan! Shit.
Don't stand next to the window, it's not safe.
Toga.
Listen, I just found out that-- Who's that?
Working undercover?
It's a full-service job.
I'll bet.
I can see by your gown that you're unarmed.
Some maniac could just stroll in and blow you both to bits.
Viv, you're obsessed. All work and no play makes Viv a dull girl.
I have to tie up some loose ends here, so take a seat.
Want some champagne?
"Enemy."
I know.
Sad news.
Your girlfriends are dead.
And Corwin?
I don't think it's gonna work out, you and me.
Which is a real bummer, since you, Dylan...
...are a tomcat in the sack.
Let me get this straight. You're a woman. Women have natural intuition.
And you're a detective. And you had no idea that this was going to happen?
-I knew. -She knew.
And I know what'll happen next.
Tell her, baby.
All the Angels are going to heaven.
And Bosley?
We'll keep him. We like him. And his computer.
He's special.
Corwin had nothing to do with this.
No. But I never really liked him.
-And the kidnapping was a setup. -Afraid so.
And Red Star was a setup.
You got it all figured out. Any other questions?
Why?
Ask your boss.
Charlie?
You're after Charlie.
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.
They say that in death...
...all life's questions are answered.
Will you let me know?
Let's go get Charlie.
Come on.
Are you all right?
-What's going on? -Something's going on.
Where's Dylan?
They say in death, all life's questions are answered.
Will you let me know?
What are we doing? House of Pancakes? Sizzler?
You are the cheapest man on the planet.
What did it look like?
Oh, I don't know. It was, like, all cool and stuff.
You've never seen a booby.
-Have too. -Have not.
-I've seen lots of boobies. -Yeah, right.
A little help?
Don't ask.
Where's Knox? Is he okay?
Oh, he's great. He's the bad guy.
The kidnapping was a setup. He's behind it all.
What? Why?
He wasn't exactly forthcoming when he shot me out the window.
Bosley!
He's safe! Knox already has him.
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.
Bosley's with the man...
...who tried to kill us. That's safe?
He won't kill Bosley until he kills Charlie.
Kills Charlie?
Oh, Jesus.
I don't know what his plan is, but I know that we can stop him.
If Knox thinks we're dead, why blow up the agency? Why does he want Charlie?
We do know that he wanted us to break into Red Star.
Imagine how dangerous this would be in the wrong hands.
Knox used us to access the mainframe not to get back his software...
...but for control of their global positioning satellites.
Knox's software can match Charlie's voice over the phone.
And use Red Star satellites to track him.
But why would Knox go to so much trouble to find Charlie?
That's the guy who killed him.
They were in Army Intelligence together.
His best friend turned on him.
Knox thinks Charlie killed his father.
So if he can intercept Charlie's call--
He can locate him.
But Knox has to get Charlie on the phone first.
-But the only one Charlie calls is-- -Bosley.
May I have some ice water, please?
Fly to me, Angels! Please come!
Please fly to me, Angels!
I had a long talk with a squirrel once.
Longer than I've talked to most humans.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello. Hello out there.
Any sign of Bosley's laptop?
They must have taken it.
-We should check Knox's place. -Let's go.
I'll drive.
Angels?! Angels, help me!
Bosley?
Angels!
We begin our broadcast day! Come and get me, girls!
If you can follow the sound of my voice, then draw some...
...triangles or something...
...to get to this location and save me!
Is there a way to trace him?
Even with our equipment, he'd have to be within 20 miles.
The place I'm in looks like Cher's bedroom.
And it stinks.
Tell us where you are.
It smells like the ocean.
And if I look out the window, I see the ocean.
He could be anywhere this half of North America.
Jack...
...tell them where I am.
What?
It's a Sitta pygmaea!
A pygmy nuthatch!
They only live in one place!
Carmel!
I can't tell you anything else, except...
...this feels like the first day of the last of my life.
Or the last day of the first of my life, or something.
I have a lighthouse, two hotels, seven manor houses...
...one owned by the National Parks, one by Nick Xero Corporation--
-Is that spelled with an "X" or a "Z"? -"X."
It's an anagram.
Rearranged, it's "Eric Knox."
Scrabble freak.
An old tunnel leads down to the shore.
A sea approach is the best way to get in undetected. We'll need a boat.
And a cover. We can't use the speedboat.
Head to the marina.
Chad, does this thing go any faster?
We're in a hurry, and I could open it up if you let me drive.
I'm sorry, friend of Starfish. There's only one captain of this love boat.
That captain is me...
...the Chad.
The Chad.
Chad, captain of the love boat.
The Chad.
We're kind of in a hurry.
I'm the Chad.
Knox Technologies voice identification software download confirmed.
Red Star satellite network uplink confirmed.
Revenge is fun.
I have to say, Starfish, I am honored...
...that you've taken an interest in my work. And I think you're very pretty.
Starfish?
Where are you going?
Starfish, are you going swimming? Where are you going?
Where are you going again?
Starfish?
Was it the Chad?
No! The Chad was great!
The Chad was great.
I'll tap the signal from the roof.
-I'll deal with Knox. -I'll bring our Bosley back.
"I don't know how to make chicken."
Jerk.
Dylan.
Thank God you're alive.
You know my better half.
It figures I'd meet the perfect guy and he'd already have a perfect girl.
Hello, blondie.
Her girlfriend's here.
Jimmy, Paulie, go secure Bosley, would you?
Like now, now, now, now.
Bos?
-Bosley? -Natalie?
Natalie, is that you?
Behind this door.
Bosley, I'm so happy to see you!
We're all here. I'll get you out.
Red wire.
Blue wire.
GPS phone tap.
Pygmy nuthatch.
-I'm getting tickled. -Who's calling now?
-It's Pete! -Pete?
Hello?
Hi, Pete. How are you?
Good. You said you wanted me to call.
I did want you to call. I mean, I do want you to.
Ask if he can call you back.
I'm so happy to hear from you.
I wanted to talk. I like spending time with you.
I'd like to see more of you, maybe in a continuous block.
I know. It's just been crazy this week at work.
Watch your back!
Use the sleeper.
Never send a man to do a woman's job.
-Nice work, Natalie. -Thanks, Bosley.
Pete? Hi.
You know, under different circumstances...
...we'd have made a great couple.
If you hadn't shot me out a window and tried to kill everyone I love...
...we could have had a chance.
Can you keep a secret?
I mean, you can't tell anyone.
That you're disgusting?
You have the fullest, sweetest...
...most luscious...
...lips I have ever...
...kissed.
I just gotta take this call.
Nine o'clock, Charlie. Right on time.
Enter. Come on.
Mr. Bosley's phone, Eric Knox speaking.
Mr. Knox? This is Charles Townsend.
I'm delighted the Angels helped you. Are you in the office?
Hang up, Charlie. He's almost got you.
We're all at the beach, having mimosas. Can you join us?
I'll take a rain check, Eric. Is Bosley there?
He went to the men's room. He'll be right back.
No, wait. He's coming.
Bosley?
Okay, here we go.
That's not him. Sorry.
Can you hold on one second longer?
Not a problem.
Pete? Can you hold on a second?
Sure.
I like him so much.
Hey, Bos.
Bosley?
He's coming, sir.
Sorry, not him.
Can I take a message?
Just tell him I called, as planned.
Gotcha.
Just one more sec.
Is this a bad time?
You seem a little distracted.
Is this the famous Charlie?
No, this is Pete.
Hey! I like that guy!
That man's got a beautiful telephone voice.
That's one more daddy you'll never know.
Bad news.
I have to leave.
I gotta go torture and kill your boss.
Mikey, Jerry...
...you guys like angel cake?
Do you know how hard it is to find a quality man in Los Angeles?
Don't take my lighter.
Wait, wait, wait! I have something to tell you.
By the time this is over...
...all of you will be facedown on the floor...
...and I'll moon-walk out of here.
You're not listening to me.
First, you're going to help me out of my chair.
Then I'll leapfrog over you...
...before I break his nose.
Since my trusty lighter...
...isn't working, I'll do all this with my hands tied behind my back.
Get her!
King Kong palm.
Buddha on lotus.
And that's kicking your ass.
Alex!
Thanks, Bos!
Come on, we'll miss happy hour.
He's heading north, just past Paradise Cove!
Oh, boy, they found him. That's Charlie's cabin.
-You've seen it? -You've seen Charlie?
I am his trusted friend and employee.
You've met Charlie?
What do you mean, "met"?
You've seen him with your own eyes.
I saw his hand.
It could have been anyone's hand.
Let's see if I can win the teddy bear!
Sorry, Charlie.
Get Dylan! The missile's making a round trip!
Dylan!
Let's go!
Charlie.
You guys...
...we're finally meeting Charlie.
Do I look okay?
Should we knock?
Charlie?
Good morning, Angels.
Sorry I couldn't stick around.
We're so happy you're okay, Charlie.
I'm just fine, Angels. Mission accomplished?
I think the client was blown away.
Eric Knox was born John McCadden.
It seems his life's mission was to bring me down.
His dad was in my Army Intelligence unit, working as a double agent.
When he was discovered, the other side killed him.
I guess that's not the story Knox heard.
Charlie, I've really enjoyed working on this assignment...
...and I eagerly anticipate returning to work.
Bosley's had one too many Buddhas.
He's definitely had a few.
I have a team rebuilding the office.
It'll be better than new when you get back.
Thank you, Charlie.
Is there any chance you'll be joining us, Charlie?
I'd love to, Angels.
But I have some precious treasures to watch over.
Come on, Charlie, it'll be fun.
We're drinking from coconuts and Buddhas.
How will we ever know you truly exist...
...unless you come have a coconut with us?
Faith, Angels. It's called faith.
-To Charlie. -To Charlie.
-To Charlie. -To Charlie.
Let me toast you ladies, with some ice cubes!
Safe!
I have to go. I'm so sorry.
I should go. I really should.
Let's see if I can win the teddy bear!
The Chad is great.
He's great. He's great.
The Chad is great. He's great.
The Chad is great.
The Chad is stuck.
I'm having helmet problems.
Funny name for an Englishman, I know.
My parents were on the same plane when it crashed. That's how they met.
They named me after the plane.
Not many people are named after a plane crash.
That's Tommy.
He tells people he was named after a gun.
But I know he was really named after a famous 19th-century ballet dancer.
Known him for as long as I can remember. He's my partner. Doesn't mean we hold hands or take walks.
Doesn't mean we hold hands or take walks. It means I try to keep him out of as much trouble as he inflicts on me.
It means I try to keep him out of as much trouble as he inflicts on me.
I give him a hard time. Keeps him in check. But really, he's like my brother.
But really, he's like my brother.
What do I know about diamonds? I'm a boxing promoter. I was a happy boxing promoter until a week ago, and then:
I was a happy boxing promoter until a week ago, and then:
What do I know about diamonds?
Don't they come from Antwerp?
-Himy, would you listen to this? -Do we have a choice?
It wasn't meant to be taken literally.
It's a nice story, Adam and Eve.
It's bound with moral fiber... ...but asking a grown man to believe it?
...but asking a grown man to believe it?
What is it?
Well, what is it?
What you want I should do, drop my pants?
Okay, go through.
It's a nice story.
It's just that. Just a story.
Catholic religion is based on a mistranslation.
Enough already. Ruben, say something.
Listen. Are you busy? I'll tell you the whole story.
The Septuagint scholars mistranslated the Hebrew word for "young woman"...
...into the Greek word for "virgin."
It was an easy mistake to make...
...because there was only a subtle difference in the spelling.
So, they came up with a prophecy:
"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear us a son."
You understand? It was "virgin" that caught people's attention.
It's not every day a virgin conceives and bears a son.
But leave that for a couple of hundred years to stew...
...and next thing you know you have the Holy Catholic Church.
Oy vay, what are you saying?
I'm saying, just because it's written...
...doesn't make it so.
Gives them hope. It's not important whether it's fact or fiction.
-People like to believe. -I don't want to hear any more.
Anyway, who is it that we're seeing?
-Michael. -Hello?
Mutti.
Rudy! Rud, Rud, let them in, please.
Rud, it's okay, let them through.
-Michael. -Mutti.
You kept us waiting for half an hour. Are you trying to give me heartburn?
Lie down on the floor.
Get on the floor!
Lie on the floor!
Get on the fucking floor!
-Get down! -Get fucking down!
Down on the floor! Get down!
On the ground!
Get down, I say!
-Time. -Seven minutes!
Where is the stone?
Where is the stone?
Where is the stone?
Michael, where is the stone?
When does your plane leave?
Twenty minutes.
Give me your gun.
When you get to London...
...if you want a gun...
...call this number.
-Boris. -Boris.
He can get you anything you need.
Is he allowed to do that?
It's an unlicensed boxing match. It's not a tickling competition.
These lads are out to hurt each other.
What's with those sausages, Charlie?
Two minutes, Turkish.
Look at it. How am I supposed to run this thing from that?
We'll need a proper office.
I want a new one. You're going to buy it for me.
Why me?
Well, you know about caravans.
How's that?
You spent a summer in one. Which means you know more than me. And I don't wanna have me pants pulled down over the price.
And I don't wanna have me pants pulled down over the price.
What's wrong with this one?
Oh, nothing, Tommy.
It's tiptop.
I'm just not sure about the color.
It's all arranged. You just got to pick it up.
Here's an address.
It's a campsite.
You've got 10 grand, and it would be nice to see change.
-What's happening with the sausages? -Five minutes.
It was two minutes five minutes ago.
They ain't pikeys, are they?
I fucking hate pikeys.
You're a sensitive boy, Tommy.
Fuck me. Hold tight.
-What's that? -It's me belt.
No, Tommy. There's a gun in your trousers.
-What's a gun doing in your trousers? -It's for protection.
Protection from what?
"Zee" Germans?
What's to stop it blowing your bollocks off when you sit?
-Where did you get it? -Boris The Blade.
You mean Boris the sneaky fucking Russian.
Heavy, isn't it?
Heavy is good.
Heavy is reliable.
If it doesn't work, you can always hit him with it.
Boris The Blade, or Boris The Bullet-Dodger.
Bent as the Soviet sickle and hard as the hammer that crosses it.
Apparently, it's just impossible to kill the bastard.
Back to my partner, Tommy.
Tommy runs the other business...
...the slot machines...
...which keeps rain off our heads and gloves on Gorgeous' hands.
However, Tommy's a little preoccupied with protection at present.
All right, I'll take it.
There's a reason for Tommy's newfound enthusiasm for firearms.
Sooner or later, in unlicensed boxing, you have to deal with that reason:
Brick Top.
If that's not worth a bet, I don't know what is.
-He doesn't look bad, does he? -No, he looks great.
He'll do you proud.
You reckon that's what people should do for me, Gary? Do me proud?
It's what you deserve.
Pull your tongue out of my arsehole.
Dogs do that.
You're not a dog, are you?
No. No, I'm not.
However...
...you do have all the characteristics of a dog, Gary.
All except loyalty.
It's rumored that his favorite means of dispatch involves a stun gun...
...a plastic bag, a roll of tape and a pack of hungry pigs.
You're a ruthless little cunt, Liam. I'll give you that.
But I got no time for grouses.
Feed him to the pigs, Errol.
What the fuck are you two looking at?
If you got to deal with him, just make sure you don't end up owing him.
Then you're in his debt.
Which means, you're in his pocket.
And once you're in that, you ain't ever coming out.
I hear he's a good fighter, so I'll use him.
I'll be doing you a favor, boy.
What he means is, I'm doing him a favor.
Because everybody knows nobody takes a dive in my fights. Unlike his.
Here, Errol, I don't think he likes me.
You don't like me, do you?
Don't know what you mean.
I do know I can't wait to get out of here. It stinks.
My fights finish prompt so we can get out before the authorities find out.
Play your cards right and I'll sort you out.
You can sort me out by showing me out.
It's hard to make a living in boxing, so now and then...
...you do something against your principles.
Basically, you have to forget you got any.
Are they Lancashire pigs?
Who's talking to you?
Oh, yeah, Tommy. Brick Top loves Tommy.
Don't let me down.
You don't want to let me down, do you?
See you ringside.
Boris, Franky-fucking-Four Fingers...
...has a diamond the size of a fist.
I have told you it's in the briefcase connected to his arm.
I sent him to you to buy a gun.
What more do you want me to do, hit him for you?
But don't you hit him either.
Americans can't know it was Russian.
It will come back to me.
So, what should I do?
You're my brother, so think like it.
Get somebody else to steal that stone!
I don't want it getting back to me.
And don't have him killed. It will raise suspicion.
So don't use idiots for the job.
He'll stay in London a couple of days before he goes to New York...
...so move quick. Okay?
It's okay. I know a couple of guys.
One more thing.
It might help.
He loves to gamble.
Eighty-six karats?
Brilliant cut, beautiful make.
A beautiful stone.
You're a good boy, Franky.
And you did a real good job. Now when do you get back?
I got to move the two-grainers here, get a better price. Couple of days.
-Talk to my cousin Dougie. -Doug The Head?
And Franky....
-And what? -Stay out of those casinos.
You did a good job, bubbe.
-Don't go screwing it up, all right? -I hear you, Avi.
I'll see you, Avi.
Eighty-six karats.
-Where? -London.
-London? -London.
-London? -Yes, London.
You know, fish, chips, cup of tea...
...bad food, worse weather, Mary-fucking-Poppins. London!
Not for me.
That's Doug The Head. Everybody knows Doug The Head.
If it's stones and it's stolen, he's the man to speak to.
Pretends he's Jewish. Wishes he was Jewish.
Even tells his family they're Jewish...
...but he's about as Jewish as he is a fucking monkey.
He thinks it's good for business. And in the diamond business...
-...it is good for business. -Avi!
He'll be there today. Take care of him.
Avi, you know I won't buy schtrops.
He isn't selling schtrops. Make it smaller.
Who do you take me for? This is England.
We play by the rules.
Listen to me.
If the stones are kosher, then I'll buy them, won't I?
Now, if you'll excuse me, it's my lunchtime. Bye.
What are you doing here?
It's a free country, isn't it?
Well, it ain't a free shop, is it?
So fuck off.
I want to see you two girls up in my office.
I had cousin Avi on the phone.
-You got to go see him. -Yeah, Dad. You told us.
-He's a big mucker in New York. -Yeah, Dad. You told us.
I want to see you girls up in my office.
Yeah, Dad. You told us.
The weight is sign of reliability.
I always go for reliability.
I'll take it.
How much do you want for it?
Nothing.
Okay, so what do you want for it?
I want you to do something for me.
There is a fight in couple of days.
What kind of a fight?
Unlicensed boxing.
There is a bookies I know that will take bets.
If you place one down for me...
...we will call it quits.
-Why don't you put it down yourself? -Well...
...there is not too many bookies that takes those kind of bets.
And I already have an outstanding debt with the house.
I know something most don't.
So, nu?
What do you know?
It's a campsite. A pikey campsite.
-Ten points. -What are we doing here?
-We're buying a caravan. -Off a pack of fucking pikeys?
What's wrong with you? This will get messy.
Not if you're here.
Oh, you bastard.
I fucking hate pikeys.
That's a flash car, mister.
Not as flash as your bike.
Who are you looking for?
Mr. O'Neil.
-Want me to get him? -That's a good lad.
Piss off.
-Are you going to go get him for me? -Yeah.
-What are you waiting for? -The five quid you'll pay me.
Fuck off, I'll find him meself.
-Two fifty. -You can have a quid.
You're a real tight fucker.
There was a problem with gypsies.
What're you doing? Get out of the way, man.
You can't understand what's being said.
You Tommy? Come about the caravan?
-Mr. O'Neil. -Fuck, man. Call me Mickey.
Not Irish, not English.
-How are you? -Weather's been kind.
It's just Pikey.
Would you look at the size of him?
How big are you?
-Kids, how big is he? -Big, for sure.
Hey, Mam, come and look at the size of this fella.
Bet you box a little, can't you, sir? You look like a boxer.
Get out of the way. See if they'd like a drink.
I could murder one.
Be no murdering done around here, I don't mind telling you.
Get your hands out of there.
Cup of tea for the big fella?
Don't be silly, Mickey. Offer the man a proper drink.
You little bugger.
-Is the big fella not coming with us? -He's minding the car.
-What does he think we are, thieves? -No, nothing like that.
-He just likes looking after cars. -Good dags. Do you like dags?
-Dags? -What?
-Yeah, dags. -Dags. You like dags?
Oh, dogs.
Sure, I like dags.
-I like caravans more. -You're very welcome.
Pikeys are well-known for their skills of negotiation in business.
It's probably why they talk like that...
...so you can't follow what's being said.
But if Tommy can get the caravan for less than the price asked...
...on his return there will be ice cream.
Good dog, good family.
He'll get a little homesick, but he'll get over it.
See you later, lads. See you, boss.
All right, Mickey. Laters.
I don't see what the fuss is about.
They aren't bad fellas.
The deal was, you bought it how you saw it.
Look, I've helped you as much as I'm going to help you.
See that car? Use it.
You should fuck off now while you still got the legs to carry you.
Nobody brings you...
...unless they're trying to say something without talking.
Just give our money back and you can keep your caravan.
Why do I want a caravan that's got no wheels?
-You want to settle this with a fight? -Over my dead body.
Now, go on! Go on!
I'll not have you fighting! You know what happens when you fight!
Get her to sit down.
For fuck's sake!
Want the money? I ain't fucked you.
I'll fight you for it. You and me.
So that's the kind of fight it'll be.
You want to stay down.
You want to stay down!
Get back down and fucking stay down.
I promise you, you want to stay down.
Deadly kick for a fat fucker, you know that?
Cheeky bastard.
-Okay, lads. -Get him on his feet.
Get back down...
...or you will not be coming up next time.
Bollocks to you.
This is sick. I'm out of here.
You're not going anywhere, you thick lump.
You stay until the job's done.
It turned out that the sweet-talking, tattoo-sporting pikey...
...was a gypsy bare-knuckle boxing champion.
Which makes him harder than a coffin nail.
Right now that's the last thing on Tommy's mind.
If Gorgeous doesn't wake up in the next few minutes...
...Tommy knows he'll be buried with him.
Why would the gypsies want to explain...
...why a man died in their campsite?
Not when they can bury the pair of them and just move camp.
It's not like they got social security numbers, is it?
Tommy, "The Tit"...
...is praying.
And if he isn't...
...he fucking should be.
Bad Boy.
-Sol. -Easy.
No, it's a moissanite.
A what?
A moissanite is an artificial diamond, Lincoln.
It's Mickey Mouse.
Spurious.
Not genuine.
And it's worth...
...fuck-all.
Bad Boy, I keep telling you, stick to being a gangster.
Leave this game to me and Sol.
Laters.
What is that, Vince?
This is a dog, Sol.
You are not bringing that thing in here.
It's only a fucking dog.
-Where'd you get it? -The gyppos. Here.
Here.
They threw it in with the moody gold.
You know gyppos, Sol. They're always throwing dogs in with deals.
It better not be dangerous.
What do you think you're doing now?
I want him to get used to the shop, don't I?
Stop the dog!
Come back!
All right, Boris?
-Don't worry about the dog. -I'm not.
What can I do for you?
I have a job for you.
I already have a job.
Fifty grand for half a day's work.
Go on.
I want you to hold up a bookies.
From Russia with love, eh?
I have stones to sell...
...fat to chew and many men to see about many ducks...
...so if I am not rushing you....
Slow down, Franky, my son. When in Rome.
I am not in Rome, Doug.
I am in a rush.
I got to make the bookies.
Bookies?
-What are you betting on? -Bomber Harris.
The unlicensed boxer?
Do you know something that I don't?
Bubbe, I probably know a lot you don't.
He's bad to the bone, ain't you, Tyrone?
Of course I am.
Tyrone will drive for us. He's done a rally driving course.
Of course I have.
I don't want that dog dribbling on my seats.
Your seats?
Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate.
While I'm at the wheel, it's my car...
...so stop that dog dribbling on my seats. All right?
I can't believe you found it. Where'd it go?
It went back to the gyppos.
Shut up. And how could it find them?
Well, I don't know. I'm not a dog, Sol.
Ask him.
It's like he's a fucking homing beacon.
Steady on the brakes.
I thought you said he could drive, Sol.
Don't worry about me. Just worry about that dog on my seats.
All right?
What?
You said he was a getaway driver. What the fuck can he get away from?
Don't worry about Tyrone. He can move when he has to.
Worry about getting us a gun.
What's that?
This is a shotgun, Sol.
It's a fucking anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.
-I want to raise pulses, don't I? -You'll raise hell, never mind pulses.
That does not look like a bookies.
Why'd we stop here? What's the matter with that space over there?
It's too tight.
Too tight?
You could land a jumbo-fucking-jet in there.
Leave him alone. He's a natural. Ain't you, Tyrone?
Of course I am.
A natural fucking idiot. Tyrone, what've you done?
Yeah, Tyrone, what have you done?
Look, you hassle me, you see what happens.
It's all right. No, don't move it now.
People'll see the damage. Why'd you do that?
I didn't see it.
It's a four-ton truck. It's not like it's a packet of fucking peanuts.
It was at a funny angle.
It's behind you, Tyrone.
Whenever you reverse, things come from behind you.
Control that dog as well.
-Get that dog off him. -Get it off me.
Give me that squeaky toy. It shut him up last time.
Don't snatch.
He can't swallow the whole ball.
Yeah.
Why the fuck...
...did you put Gorgeous George...
...into a bare-knuckle boxing match...
...two days before he had to fight The Bomber?
He was half his size. I didn't expect him to get hurt.
You put the man into a bare-knuckle boxing match.
What the fuck did you expect?
A grease-down and a shiatsu?
Who took the jam out of your doughnut?
You took the fucking jam out of my doughnut.
You did.
You said get a good deal.
I fail to recognize the correlation...
...between losing 10 grand, hospitalizing Gorgeous...
...and a good deal.
How'll we explain this to Brick Top?
That his fight won't happen?
We replace the fighter.
Oh, and hope he doesn't notice?
Who the fuck will we replace him with?
What about John The Gun?
Or Mad Fist Willy?
You're not Mr. Current Affairs, are you?
Mad Fist went mad...
...and The Gun shot himself.
Jesus.
-What? -Let's use the fucking pikey.
-How much you gonna pay us? -10 K.
Me bollocks. Lose more than that running for the bus.
All right.
I'll do it for a caravan.
A what?
A caravan.
-Top of the range and all that. -It was us that wanted a caravan.
Anyway, what's wrong with this one?
It's not for me. It's for me ma.
Your what?
His ma.
Brick Top runs an illegal bookies.
They take bets on anything that involves blood and pain.
Now I'm changing fighters...
...and Brick Top's gonna exploit the situation.
He's gonna pull my pants down, grease me up...
...and aim for penetration.
If I didn't have the replacement pikey...
...he'd want to split me in half.
They could charm the paint off walls, these fellas.
Look mean now, you hairy fucker, won't you?
Shits himself when you put him in the ring.
Poke him with a stick, you watch his bollocks grow.
Do you like a dog fight, Turkish?
We've lost Gorgeous George.
You're gonna have to repeat that.
We've lost Gorgeous George.
Well, where'd you lose him?
He ain't a set of fucking car keys, is he?
And it's not as if he's incon-fucking-spicuous, is it?
We're not backing out.
You bet your bollocks to a barn dance you're not.
We're changing the fighter.
Oh, fuck me, your lady friend got a voice?
Who are you changing him to, sweetheart?
You won't know him, but he's mustard.
Mustard?
I don't care if he's Muhammad "I'm Hard" Bruce Lee...
...you can't change fighters.
-You've still got your fight. -No.
I lose all bets at the bookies. You can't change fighters.
So, no, I don't have my fight, do I, you fucking prat?
You can take bets at the fight.
Put a lead on her, Turkish, before she gets bitten.
Do you want to get bitten, sweetheart?
Make sure your man goes down in the fourth.
You understand me now, don't you, Turkish?
This is the one place I didn't want to be:
In his debt.
Which now means I'm in his pocket.
You're on thin fucking ice, my pedigree chums.
And I shall be under it when it breaks.
Now, fuck off.
Doug, where's Franky Four Fingers?
I don't know. I'm not his mother. But I'm seeing him later.
-When later? -He said he wanted cash.
So he's coming back after he's been to a fight.
A fight?
What do you mean, a fight? A boxing match?
-Is there gambling involved? -It's a boxing match, Avi.
-Did he have a case with him? -Yes, he had a case.
And this schmuck is gambling?
You're talking about Franky "I've got a problem with gambling" Four Fingers.
Avi, I'm not telepathic.
You're plenty stupid, I'll give you that.
Do you know why they call him Franky Four Fingers?
I have no idea.
Because he makes stupid bets with dangerous people.
When he doesn't pay up, they give him the chop.
And I'm not talking about his fucking foreskin.
I'm sure he can pay.
Not with my goods. Got a toothbrush? We're going to London.
Do you hear that? I'm coming to London!
-Avi! -Shut up and sit down, you bald fuck!
I don't like leaving my own country...
...especially leaving it for anything less than warm, sandy beaches...
...and cocktails with little straw hats.
We've got sandy beaches.
So who the fuck wants to see them?
I hope you can appreciate the concern I have for my friend Franky.
I'll find him, and you'll help me find him.
And we'll start at that fight.
How am I gonna get it out?
It will probably cough it up.
Will he be all right?
I hope not.
-Are we gonna rob this bookies? -Yes, big man.
Why are we waiting?
We are waiting for a man with four fingers, carrying a briefcase.
And why's that?
Because the deal is, the Russian gets the case, we get the money.
What's in the case?
For fuck's sake, Tyrone, just concentrate on the steering wheel.
Jesus.
-Private night tonight, chaps. -I'm well aware of that, my son.
That's why we're here.
Well done. This is the back way in.
Oh, really? I thought it was the front.
-Private night tonight, chaps. -We know. That's why we're here.
Tickets.
Are we ever gonna get into this place?
Avi, Avi, you gotta understand.
This ain't exactly Vegas, and this ain't exactly legal.
I'm not looking for Vegas or for legal.
I'm looking for Franky.
I know that, and he said he's gonna be here.
-If there's gambling, he'll be here. -Let's not have a fuck-up.
You won't let us down.
He's going down in the fourth, don't you worry about that.
Is that him?
I don't know. How many fingers did he have?
Sorry, I didn't get the binoculars out in time.
Let's not stand on ceremony. Let's start the show.
Do you know who this bookies belongs to?
If you know what's good for you you'll give me everything--
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing up here?
This is starting to hurt, Solomon.
Drop the screen now.
How you doing, Vince?
I'd do a lot better if you'd stop using my name.
-Fill that bag. -All bets are off.
I am not in here to make a fucking bet.
Appreciated...
...but all bets...
...are...
...off.
If all bets are off, there can't be any money, can there?
I ain't fucking buying that.
That's handy because I ain't fucking selling it. It's a fact.
What have you got?
Nothing, really.
A few coins, but no notes.
Show me your hands.
You've got five fingers.
Copper coins.
What do you mean, copper fucking coins?
It won't open because it's a security door.
Hold that.
My leg.
What are you moaning about? It didn't even touch it.
We're fucked.
What the fuck are you two doing?
Get us out of here.
Tyrone, what are you doing? Get us out of here!
Who the fuck is this man, Tyrone?
He's a man with four fingers and a briefcase, Vinny.
In the red corner...
...we have the young and unchallenged....
So, Mickey, you're going down in the fourth. Is that clear?
Just make sure he doesn't kill me.
So give it up for the bone-crunching...
...one-punch machine gun...
...Mickey!
And in the other corner....
Now, I know he looks like a fat fucker--
Well, he is a fat fucker, but he's dirty and he's dangerous.
Bomber "The Mad Man" Harris!
Now, try and look like a fighter.
Let's get ready...
...to rumble!
Do you realize I'm fucking forty grand down?
What's the fucking crack?
-I'll make it up to you. -I ain't happy.
I'll make it up to you, I promise. Stand on me.
Oh, that fucking pikey's put me in it.
Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.
Listen, you fucking fringe, if I throw a dog a bone...
...I don't want to know if it tastes good.
Stop me again whilst I'm walking and I'll cut your fucking jacobs off.
-He's here. -Well, you explain it to him.
-What you doing? -The case was attached to his arm.
So why didn't you chop it off?
We ain't fucking butchers, Boris.
But he has the case.
Look, we-- Well, you have a problem.
There weren't much cash at the bookies.
Okay.
Here is the 10 grand.
No. Keep it. We want this.
Well, at least half of this.
What was in the case was mine.
What was in the bookies was yours. Okay?
It wasn't much, but here is the 10 large to help the situation.
No, I'm afraid it's too late for that.
We want half of this, and that's because we're being generous.
We could, by all rights, keep the whole fucking stone, Boris.
Watch out!
Drop the gun, fat boy.
You fucking idiots. He could not know my name.
Give me the stone.
-It's in the case. -What?
It's in the case.
You put the stone in the case?
Open it and give me the stone.
The only man who knew the combination, you just shot.
Now, it's not too clever to hang about after Mickey's performance.
Brick Top, in short, will be looking to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.
I know he's looking for us, but I don't have a choice.
I'm happy to leave the country, but I need money to do so.
But any money I have is in the safe, which is in the office.
Once I have that, it's--
Oink, oink.
Shit.
So that's where you keep the sugar.
What brings you two here? Run out of pants to sniff?
That sounds like hostility, doesn't it?
And we don't like hostility, do we, Errol?
No, we don't, John.
I just had them polished.
Go and put the kettle on.
-You take sugar? -No, thank you, Turkish.
I'm sweet enough.
He is now your problem.
Okay?
You can keep the 10 grand, along with the body...
...but if I see you again, you motherfuckers....
Well, look at him.
I've got a bare-knuckle fight in a couple of days.
I want to use the pikey.
All right. Of course.
Of course, fucking of course.
I wasn't asking, I was telling.
But this time...
...I do want him to go down in the fourth.
And I do mean it, this time.
Now, I know you come back here to open your safe.
So now you can open it.
Turkish has been a busy little bastard.
I think he's got away with enough.
Thinking can get you into trouble, Errol. I shouldn't do so much of it.
That takes care of one little piggy.
Now find me the silly sods who blagged the bookies.
Find them today.
Top of the morning to you, Mrs. O'Neil.
Tommy.
You're a snake in the grass, ain't you? Where'd they come from?
You're looking for my boy, are you?
-Do you know where I can find him? -Yeah.
Would you like to share that information?
I don't want you getting my boy into trouble.
He's my only boy. And he's a good boy.
He's coursing.
What's coursing?
Hare coursing.
They set two lurchers-- They're dogs, before you ask.
On a hare.
And the hare has to outrun the dogs.
So, what if it doesn't?
Well, the big rabbit gets fucked, doesn't it?
Proper fucked?
Yeah, Tommy.
Before "zee" Germans get there.
Do you know these tits, Errol?
I know a lot of tits...
...but I don't know any as fucking stupid as these two.
John?
I can't help, guv.
Tyrone.
You silly, fat bastard.
-Do you want to do it? -That depends.
On what?
On you buying this caravan.
Not the rouge one. The rose.
-It's not the same caravan. -Not the same fight.
It's twice the size of the last one.
The fight is twice the size. And me ma needs a caravan.
I like to look after me ma. It's a fair deal. Take it.
You're lucky we aren't worm food after your last performance.
Buying a tart's mobile palace is a little fucking rich.
I wasn't calling your mum a tart. I just meant....
Save your breath for cooling your porridge.
Right. And she's terrible partial to the periwinkle blue.
Have I made myself clear?
Yeah, that's perfectly clear, Mickey.
Just give me one minute to confer with my colleague.
Did you understand a word of what he said?
I'll tell you what.
Fucker.
I'll bet you for it.
You'll what?
He'll bet you for it.
What, like Tommy did last time? Do me a favor?
I'll do you a favor.
You have first bet. If I win, I get a caravan...
...and the boys get a pair of them shoes.
If I lose...
...fuck it, I'll do the fight for free.
The last thing I really want to do is bet a pikey.
However, I don't really have much of a choice.
Somehow I've got to get him to fight, but if I lose....
Well, I don't even want to think about losing.
Okay. I reckon the hare gets fucked.
What? Proper fucked?
You got that, London?
We're on!
I'll fucking tell you! Get those off me.
I'll tell you who robbed your bookies.
Periwinkle blue. Bye, boys.
Who's proper fucked now, then?
There's something very wrong with this.
It was us that wanted to buy a caravan off of him.
Well, why didn't you "bust a cap in his ass" then, Tommy?
Mind you, you'd do more damage if you threw it at him.
What? You saying I can't shoot?
Oh, no, Tommy. I wasn't saying you can't shoot.
I know you can't shoot.
What we're saying is, that piece of shit stuck in your trousers...
...would do more damage if you fed it to him.
You saying the gun don't work?
You tried it?
Whoops.
I want to see that sneaky fucking Russian.
Why's he got a tea cozy on his head?
To keep his head warm.
-What happened to him? -He got shot in the face.
I thought that was obvious.
What'd you do that for? You mistake him for a rabbit?
-What do you want me to do? -Sort it out.
-I'm not a witch doctor. -But you are a bad boy yardie...
...and bad boy yardies should know how to get rid of bodies.
I create the bodies, I don't erase the bodies.
We're in, governor.
Goody gumdrops.
Get us a cup of tea, would you, Errol?
Grab hold of his legs.
What do you think I'm gonna grab him by, his ears?
Hope this is not a bad moment.
Do you know who I am?
I do.
Good. That will save me some time, then.
Well, I don't.
You're always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece.
Apparently, the best thing to do...
...is cut up a corpse into six pieces and pile it all together.
Would someone mind telling me, who are you?
When you got your six pieces, you gotta get rid of them.
It's no good leaving it in the freezer for your mum to discover.
Then I hear the best thing to do is feed them to pigs.
You gotta starve the pigs for a few days...
...then the chopped-up body will look like curry to a pisshead.
You gotta shave the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out...
...for the piggies' digestion.
You could do this afterwards, of course...
...but you don't want to sieve through pigshit, do you?
They will go through bone like butter.
You need at least 16 pigs to finish the job in one sitting...
...so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm.
They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds...
...in about eight minutes.
That means that a single pig...
...can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh...
...every minute.
Hence the expression...
..."as greedy as a pig."
Well, thank you for that. That's a great weight off me mind.
Now, if you wouldn't mind telling me who the fuck you are...
...apart from someone who feeds people to pigs, of course.
Do you know what "nemesis" means?
"A righteous infliction of retribution...
...manifested by an appropriate agent."
Personified, in this case, by a horrible cunt:
Me.
Gentlemen....
Why can't you find me Franky, Doug?
Avi, what do you want me to do? I'm not a bounty hunter.
What about Tony?
Bullet-Tooth Tony.
Who's Bullet-Tooth--?
-Tony! -You silly fuck.
He's a liability.
He'd find Moses and the burning bush.
You are gonna die, Tony!
He got shot six times, had the bullets molded into gold.
I shoot you, you go down!
He has two in his teeth that Dad did, so he loves Dad.
Why don't you fucking die?
-He's the best chance you got. -Six times?
In one sitting.
You're in trouble now.
Sounds promising. What are we waiting for?
Bonjour.
What's so fucking important?
Why do you think we've got a dead man...
-...missing an arm in our office? -Talk to me, tell me.
You give us four days...
...I'll get you a stone the size of a fucking home. I kid you not.
What do you think, Errol?
I think we should drip-dry them, while we got the chance.
It was a rhetorical question, Errol.
What have I told you about thinking?
-You got 48 hours. -Yeah.
You can keep that silly, fat wanker. The lads can't lift him.
Forty-eight hours.
After that it's your family...
...and the pigs finish what the dogs don't do.
So, what should I call you? Should I call you "Bullet"? "Tooth"?
Call me "Susan" if it makes you happy.
Tony, there is a man I'd like you to find.
That depends on all the elements in the equation. How many are there?
Forty thousand.
Where was he last seen?
At a bookies.
Bookies?
Pass us the blower, Susi.
-Bookies got blagged last night. -Blagged? Speak English.
This country spawned the language, and nobody seems to speak it.
Blagged, robbed.
We'll see a man that may know something.
I need a gun.
You don't, Rosebud, me old son. You need me.
I got fucking black ink all over fuck boy.
He's stained for fucking life.
That and the golden teeth as well. Fucking hell--
All right, Mullet?
How you doing? You all right, mate?
Nice tie.
I heard you weren't about that much.
Still warm, the blood that courses through my veins.
Unlike yours, Mullet.
Who blagged Brick Top's bookies?
-Do me a favor, Tone. -I will do you a favor, Mullet.
I'll not bash the fuck out of you in front of all your girlfriends.
Gonna make it worth my while, mate? Jesus, you know how it is, man.
Comfortable, Mullet?
It's sadly ironic it's that tie that's got you into this pickle.
Now, you take all the time you want, mate.
What the fuck you doing, Tone?
Driving down the street with your head in my window.
-What you think I'm doing? -Well, don't, Tone.
You been using dog shit for toothpaste?
Slow down, Tone.
Slow down, Tony!
I don't think so. I think I'll speed up.
Play some music if you like.
I love this track.
I want to know who blagged Brick Top's bookies.
Yes, Mullet?
I think it's two black guys that work from a pawnshop in Smith Street.
Better not be telling me porky pies.
I tell you, it's two black guys work out of a pawnshop on Smith Street.
It's very effective, Tony.
It's not too subtle, but effective.
Are we taking him with us?
It's the Russian.
A Russian?
To be technical he's an Uzbekistanian.
Uzbekistanian? I've been dealing with those sneaky Russian dogs.
-Give me a name. -Yurinov.
Boris.
-Boris The Blade? -Yeah.
As in Boris The Bullet-Dodger?
Why do they call him The Bullet-Dodger?
Because he dodges bullets, Avi.
He won't fight unless we buy his mum a caravan...
...and you nicked all our savings.
In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary, come again?
He's a stubborn bastard. He said he's got to look after his mum.
-Are you taking the piss? -What can I do?
I can't make him do it, can I?
You're not much good to me alive are you, Turkish?
He's a useless shite, that boy. Punish him for me, Errol.
I want that pikey to fight.
Brick Top thought smashing up our arcade...
...might help me to persuade Mickey to fight.
And if that wasn't enough...
...he thought it would be a good idea...
...to burn Mickey's mum's caravan.
While she was asleep in it.
Turkish, get your arse up.
You lot...
...follow me and I'll fucking shoot you.
Calm down, son. Behave yourself.
I've got the gun, son. I think it's you who should behave.
What?
You want to see if I've got the minerals?
Jesus.
Sorry, Mickey.
Did you do it?
Then what are you sorry for?
-What are you two doing here? -Come back!
-You got some tars on you. -Fuck off, Darren.
Fuck off!
How silly do I feel?
His mum is still smoking next to us...
...and I'm asking him to fight.
I'll do the fight before he causes any more carnage.
And if he'd said no...
...it could've been a shite sight worse.
Russians.
Russians.
I should've known.
Anti-Semite, slippery Cossack sluts.
What do you know about this goyim?
Ex-KGB cancer.
He was a highly trained undercover agent.
He'll be impossible to track down.
Yeah.
There's a strange man who wants to sell us an 84-karat stone.
-Where's he from? -I don't know. Hard to tell.
He's got a thick Russian accent.
Well, what was I supposed to do? He set the dogs on me. Look.
That sneaky Russian! No wonder he didn't want to do it.
First things first. One of us...
...Tyrone, you go to the Russian's. The second you see him, call us.
Now.
He's a right handful, this fella, so watch out.
I hate Russians. I'll take care of him.
All yours, Rosebud, old son.
Not a problem.
Get me to a doctor.
Shoot that fuck! Then, get me to a doctor.
Okay, but first we get the stone.
First the stone. Then a doctor.
And not just any doctor, boychik. A nice Jewish doctor.
Find my friend a nice Jewish doctor!
Get his keys and find out where the stone is.
-I think you got something to tell us. -Take it easy, Rosebud.
Do you want him to be able to talk or not?
What the fuck do you mean, replicas?
They look the shit, don't they? And nobody is gonna argue.
I've got extra loud blanks, just in case.
In case we have to deafen them to death?
-Yeah. -Boris is here.
-We're coming over. Hold him there. -Hold on!
He's not on his own!
We're off.
Very industrious for a Cossack.
Sneaky fucking Russian.
So, where is he?
It's not just he. Three fellas went in the house.
-They locked Boris in the car. -Why didn't you tell us that?
Did they look hard?
They looked messy.
-Let's get out of here. -What about the Russian?
I want you to bury him.
All right.
I think we should get you a new gun.
But this time, try it.
How far to the Russian's?
Be there in a minute.
-Come on, then. -No, no, not so fast, Vinny.
We can't take them now. We're gonna have to follow them.
You shouldn't drink that stuff, anyway.
Why? What's wrong with it?
-It's not in sync with evolution. -Shut up.
How do we get rid of him?
-Do you want to shoot him? -It's a little noisy.
-Do you want to stab him? -That's a little cold-blooded.
-Do you want to kill him or not? -I'll cut him. I got a blade.
That's the spirit.
Do they fire?
Of course they fire.
But how do you know? They're replicas.
What do you know about replicas?
What the fuck are you doing, Solomon?
You wanted to know whether they worked.
I didn't mean try it in the car, Sol, you arsehole!
What are you gonna do with that, pick his teeth?
Wipe the butter off and put it away. There's a proper blade back there.
Cows have only been domesticated in the last 8000 years.
Before, they were running around mad as lorries.
The human digestive system hasn't got used to any dairy products yet.
Well, fuck me, Tommy. What have you been reading?
Let me do you a favor.
Whoops.
You. Want a knife?
No, not me. I wouldn't know what to do.
It's a knife, for God's sake.
What's kept your fork company all these years?
The sharp side, a blunt side. What do you want, a lesson?
Is that Boris?
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?
What about Rosebud?
Well, you can bring him with you if you like.
But which bit would you like?
They're getting out.
Get down and follow them.
Cover yourself up, Avi.
You're making a scene.
I'm sorry for causing a scene, Tony.
Whoa, you are not taking that dog with you, Vince.
I can't leave him in here, can I?
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.
I thought you wanted to get cleaned up. Bathroom's back there.
-He's left the door open. -Shouldn't think that's a good idea.
Should we go in?
I don't want to go in there. He's a dangerous bastard.
Taken too many disco biscuits in the heat of Russian disputations.
He's got as many of these nuts as he has those nuts.
I don't care if he's got fucking hazelnuts.
I want a gun that works, and I'm gonna tell him.
My God, Tommy, you certainly got those minerals.
Well, come on then, before "zee" Germans get here.
You just tell him who's in charge.
Boris--
You certainly told him.
The Drowning Trout.
Come and pick us up. And Doug...
...sharpish.
I don't want a fuss or to put a bullet in your face...
...but unless you give me what I want, there will be fucking murders.
What's your name?
Shoot him.
Let go of the gun!
So, you're obviously the big dick...
...and that, on either side of you, are your balls.
There are two types of balls:
There are big brave balls, and there are little faggot balls.
These are your last words so make them a prayer.
Dicks have drive and clarity of vision...
...but they're not clever.
They smell pussy and they want a piece of the action.
And you thought you smelled some good old pussy...
...and have brought your two little faggot balls along...
...for a good old time. But you've got your parties muddled up.
There's no pussy here...
...just a dose that'll make you wish you were born a woman.
Like a prick...
...you're having second thoughts.
You're shrinking.
And your two little balls are shrinking with you.
The fact that you've got "Replica" written on the side of your gun...
...and the fact that I've got "Desert Eagle .50"...
...written on the side of mine...
...should precipitate...
...your balls into shrinking, along with your presence.
Now...
...fuck off.
Lock the door.
Lock it!
Give me the case.
Fuck you.
Shoot me.
I will. I'll shoot you.
Pass me case or I shoot you.
You know what?
Fuck you too.
Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be doing me a favor, you Russian fuck.
You! Drop guns.
Fuck you!
You drop your gun!
Okay.
Avi...
...pull your socks up!
-Tyrone? -Fuck it. We're out of here.
Give me case.
Avi...
-...where's the case? -Put the gun away.
What's Boris doing here?
Boris, what are you doing here?
Fuck you!
Where's the case?
-You piece of crap. -Don't take the piss, Boris.
I'll show you.
Fuck you!
Almost had it.
For fuck's sake.
Fuck you and all.
You lucky bastard.
Jeez, it's flawless.
Don't get attached to it. It's going to Brick Top.
Leave the dog here.
-Sol, why don't we just leave? -Because life's too short, Vincent...
...and it'll get a lot shorter if Brick Top wishes.
-Now leave that dog here. -I'm gonna leave the dog here.
Don't worry about it!
And if that pikey mutt does any damage, you're gonna pay.
It's okay.
Sit down. Down.
I don't want to go in there. You'll never see me again.
Well, we won't if you don't.
All right, you give me the stone...
...and I will give it to Brick Top. Yeah?
All right. Give me a minute. It's a bit fiddly.
Why is it down there?
Well, I put it down there in case we got mugged.
You ain't from this planet, are you?
Who is gonna mug two black fellas holding pistols...
...sat in a car that's worth less than your shirt?
Bullet-Tooth Tony and his friend, Desert Eagle .50.
What have they got to do with anything?
They're both staring straight at me.
You should never underestimate the predictability of stupidity.
Now, out of the car.
And leave your water pistols behind.
Look, just tell him the stone's back at the office.
I'll think of something.
Why's he sweating?
Oh, never mind.
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?
-I'm a little worried, actually. -Worried about what?
What happens if the gypsy knocks the other man out?
I mean, he's done it before, hasn't he?
We get murdered before we leave the building, and we get fed to the pigs.
I'm glad to see you're climbing the walls in fucking anxiety.
Pardon my cynicism, but I don't exactly trust the pikey.
Don't think I haven't thunk about that one.
It's his mum's funeral tonight. God bless her.
You know those gypsies like a drink at a wake.
I'm not worried about whether Mickey knocks the other man out.
I'm worried about whether he makes it to the fourth round.
What if he doesn't make it to the fourth round?
We get murdered before leaving the building...
...and I imagine we get fed to the pigs.
So why are you so calm?
-I said-- -I heard what you said, Tommy!
It's not as though we've got a choice, now, is it?
You show me how to control a wild fucking gypsy...
...and I'll show you how to control an unhinged, pig-feeding gangster.
Bollocks! I'm going for a walk.
Oh, that fucking dog!
Go on, get the dog.
-It's a bit funky in here, isn't it? -Open a window.
You people live like animals.
Now, where's the stone?
-Come on, where is it? -It's over here.
-Where? Where? -I left it in a box.
It's empty.
I'm getting heartburn. Tony, do something terrible.
No, I'm being serious!
The dog. The dog must have ate it.
Now then, let's have a look, shall we? Tony.
-What? -Look in the dog.
-You mean, "look in the dog"? -I mean, open him up.
It's not a tin of baked beans. What do you mean, open him up?
You know what I mean.
That's a bit strong.
I don't know about this.
No, you can't do this.
It's fucking squeaking!
You never heard a dog squeak before? Give me that goddamn gun!
I'm shooting the dog!
You sneaky fucking bastard.
Thank God for that.
I hate fucking dogs! Come on, Tony.
Tony, come on!
Tony?
-Anything to declare? -Yeah. Don't go to England.
That dog is gonna go back to the campsite. It always does.
How's the dog gonna find the campsite?
Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?
All right. But we have to wait until it gets light.
And we have to get rid of these bodies.
That one with the tea cozy on his head's starting to stink.
Right. Let's stick them in the car, and then go and look for a pig farm.
Mickey.
Mickey!
You feeling all right, Mickey?
Need a drink.
You can't give him a drink!
It's not for him. It's for me.
Ah, mates. Amen.
He's a hard bastard, this Good Night Anderson, so pay attention.
All right, Mickey?
Mickey!
Need to have a shite!
If you see the pikey, Turkish or his girlfriend come out before me...
...shoot the bastards.
Well, come on. We got a fight to go to.
All right, Tom.
-Hope we get a better show this time. -This will make up for it.
Mickey's going down in the fourth.
Terry over there is in charge of the bets.
Now, you have to forgive me.
I'll forgive you if he goes down this time.
-Our lads at the campsite? -They're over there now.
I fucking hate pikeys.
-How long have we gotta stay here? -As long as it takes. Now, shut up.
Fucking hate pikeys.
Is he fucking stoned?
He's like that before a fight.
Do you know when you're going down?
Of course he knows when he's going down.
Fuck-face, who's speaking to you? He asked him, didn't he?
Fuck-face? I like that one, Errol. I'll remember that next time I climb off your mum.
I'll remember that next time I climb off your mum.
-Not now. -Gonna be a tragedy of a fight.
Be a nice one. Hell of a way to war.
And they're none of yours.
There's a camp full of pikeys that might not think you're so funny.
Not when they're putting out flames on their children's backs.
Now get up and have a fucking fight.
Three rounds and you're a vegetable, aren't you, pikey!
I'm in charge here. No fucking about, no eye-gouging.
Do your worst. Let's get it on!
What the fuck's going on? You gonna finish him or what?
Talk about saved by the bell.
Do you understand the consequences of knocking that man out?
Do not knock him out, Mickey.
All right, let's break it up.
What, is he fucking deaf?
What is he doing?
Come on and sit.
What the fuck are you doing, Mickey?
You're dancing like a fairy.
They'll hang us if they think it's rigged.
Get out there and hurt him.
But for fuck's sake, do not knock him out.
All he's got to do is stay down.
Now, we are fucked.
He can't stand up.
We're out of here.
Stupid pikey knows Brick Top's got keen-to-kill monkeys with shotguns...
...sitting outside his campsite.
Once the campsite's wiped out, I know it's gonna be the same for us.
Ever cross the road and look the wrong way?
Give me that fucking shooter!
And, hey, presto, there's a car nearly on you.
So, what do you do?
Something very silly.
You freeze. And your life doesn't flash before you...
...because you're too scared to think.
You just freeze and pull a stupid face.
But the pikey didn't. Why?
Because he had plans on running the car over.
It had previously occurred to me...
...that he'd taken the demise of his mother rather lightly.
For every action, there is a reaction.
And a pikey reaction...
...is quite a fucking thing.
Pete, talk to me.
If you want your friend to hear you, talk a lot louder than that.
-Give me that fucking shooter. -I'll give you your shooter, you cunt.
That is when I thought the pikey had money riding on himself.
That's why the bastard never goes down when he's supposed to.
We've been tucked up...
...while he's been cleaning up.
We're worse off now than when we started.
The next day we went to the campsite...
...but the gypsies had disappeared during the night.
Which was probably a good thing...
...considering they'd just buried 12 people somewhere in the area.
Where is he?
He ain't fucking here, that's for sure.
We can't ask a man to fight for us if we can't find him, can we?
You won't find a pikey that doesn't want to be found.
He could be in a campsite in Kampu-fucking-chea by now.
Bollocks! Come on.
-What you doing here? -What's it got to do with you?
So, what you doing here?
I'm taking the dog for a walk. What's the problem?
What's in the car?
Seats and a steering wheel.
What do you know about gypsies?
I know they're not to be trusted.
All right, get your dog. On your way.
Get the dog, Tommy.
The dog.
All right, boy. Come on. Come on, Daisy. No, Daisy!
He loves that dog.
Always playing silly games.
Stop messing about and get it in the car. Tommy!
Good boy. Good boy. Good boy, Daisy, good boy.
Could you tell me...
...why you got a dead man with an arm missing in your boot?
Hey, George...
...is that a tea cozy on his head?
Oh, you love a dog, don't you, Tommy?
Tommy persuaded me to keep the dog.
I eventually agreed, as long as he took it to a vet.
I couldn't stand that squeaking anymore.
The vet found half an undigested shoe, a squeaky toy...
...and an 84-karat diamond lodged in its stomach.
It's quite amazing what can happen in a week.
Still didn't shut it up, though.
So, what do you do?
You go see the man that knows about these sort of things.
So, what do you think?
She said it.
She did.
MAN: (ON RADIO) ...with some precipitation in the Central Valley.
Reno area, a little milder. Looking like a low predicted at 37 degrees
and a high at 42.
The low-pressure systems continue in the mountains of the Sierras.
We've got some snow flurries at times down to about 5,000 feet.
And we are gonna see some hazy sunshine in the morning.
Go, Mick, go.
Yeah, okay.
(SHUTTER CLOSING)
Good morning. Jerry.
There you are. Morning.
Oh, I've gotta plug that fridge back in. l thought it was going with you.

Move it.
POLICE OFFICER: Come on, Stan, you're late.
ALL: Surprise!
Congratulations, Jerry.
No parking on this street. You saw that?
Come on now, Jerry! Hey, Larry. You outlasted me. (CHUCKLES)
Hey, thanks for coming.
Congratulations. Good to see you. Thanks for comin'. Congratulations. Appreciate it.
COP 1: Enjoy yourself. JERRY: Thank you. COP 2: Congratulations. JERRY: Thanks.
Thank you.

and got you this ticket.
lt's supposed to be the best marlin fishing in all of Baja.
So go catch a big one for us, Jer. (ALL APPLAUD AND CHEER)
Gee.
Well. (CLEARS THROAT)
Appreciation all around, uh...
What can l say? You shouldn't have.
But you did, and uh...
Hits me deep.
Thank you.
POLLACK: l'm going back to the station. Get Becker County on the phone.
You guys should go on up. KROLAK: It's gonna be dark by the time we get up there...
Thanks.
What's up?
Juvenile homicide. Becker County.
Possible sexual assault. Little girl.
Upper lakes? Why isn't the local handling it?
Our hard-core crime unit assists that jurisdiction now.
Jerry, for Christ sake, you're retiring.
l still got six more hours.
As far as l'm concerned, you're gone. lt's Krolak's case.
He's in charge, his call. lt's fine with me.
KROLAK: If you want to leave your own party. My coat's upstairs.
REPORTER: Good evening, this is Elena Ryan and I'm just outside of Reno,
and in behind you have the crime scene
where the body of a young girl has just been found.
And we have emergency vehicles coming in and out of here. (POLICE SIREN WAILING)
We have state troopers, we have Reno police.
(SIRENS WAILING) STROM: Bruising and lacerations evident on the interior of both thighs.
Bruising and possible wrist fractures due to restraints.
Neck slashed.
KROLAK: Did you get her age in there?
SHERIFF: She, uh... She was a second-grader. l guess that'd put her about seven and a half, eight.
Coupled with initial signs of lividity, all indications
Coupled with initial signs of lividity, all indications are the victim's body was not moved from initial place of death.
SHERIFF: We checked the entire perimeter.
Even with the snow, this path's the only way in or out.
So what the fuck are you doing standing on it? Oh, l'm sorry.
STROM: ...and other weather-related contamination.
Whose fucking pen is this? STROM: Lashes on both...
Oh, Jesus, that's... lt's mine. Pardon me.
Any sign of a weapon?
Any sign of a weapon? SHERIFF: No, but, l mean, a knife like that, you could chuck it pretty far.
Assuming it was a knife. KROLAK: How long before you can wrap this up?
Couple more minutes.
Couple more minutes. Okay, I'm gonna let the Coroner know he can pick her up. (SNIFFS)
The buttons.
Have the lab guys check for prints on the buttons.
On both the coat and the dress.
Goddamn it.
(SNIFFS) Strom, be sure and secure all the buttons for lab work
before you move her out.
Hey, guys, get the buttons... KROLAK: Let's go, big guy.
What about the little girl's parents?
Duane and Margaret Larsen.
They got a turkey farm about 10 miles from here.
Good people. You can go ahead and pick her up now!
KROLAK: Have you interviewed them? SHERIFF: No.
Uh, we haven't told them yet.
None of us knew what to say.
(SIGHS) Jesus Christ.
KROLAK: Nobody told the little girl's parents.
KROLAK: ls this the little boy right here? SHERIFF 1: Yeah.
Evening, son.
Chilly out here, isn't it?
Why don't you take him back to your station. l'll talk to him there.
Right. Anything on the suspect or his truck?
Hang on.
Highway Patrol got anything?
SHERIFF 2: Todd said he put it out there.
lt's out statewide, and l got highway patrol on it.
Congratulations.
Now, who's gonna tell the parents?
Does anybody here know them?
l got one of my deputies, but he'd rather not. (CHUCKLES)
He'd rather not.
Most Wednesdays, Ginny stays in town.
For music lessons with my mother.
But when she's behind on her homework,
(SOBBING) she comes straight home.
So her grandmother would've assumed that she came home?
We always let Ginny...
Yes.
(DOOR OPENS) Excuse me, um,
Pastor Holcomb's on his way over. JERRY: Thank you.
Would you mind not smoking in the house, please?
Sorry.
(SOBS) It isn't possible.
There can't be such a devil.
There are such devils.
l want to see my daughter.
l don't think that's a good idea, Mr. Larsen, uh...
(SIGHING) l know what l'm saying might sound cruel but...
l think it's better if you don't go to your Ginny now.
Why would it be better for me not to see my daughter?
Why would that be better?
Because we hardly dared to look ourselves.
You can go to your Ginny tomorrow evening.
Then there won't be anything that's, um...
MARGARET: What? JERRY: She'll look just like she fell asleep. Believe me.
Who did this?
We intend to find out, Mrs. Larsen.
Do you promise me that you will?
Yes.
Yes, Mrs. Larsen, l promise.
By your soul's salvation?
Do you swear...
By your soul's salvation on this cross,
made by the hands of our daughter?
Yes.
Yes, on my soul's salvation.
(WHISPERING) You've sworn by your salvation.
We will pray.
DEPUTY: Detective!
Detective Black?
Looks like they got him.
Highway Patrol picked up a match on the truck with an Indian driver. (KROLAK SINGING) ♪ One little two little three little Indians

KROLAK: Toby, l can't see your eyes, buddy.
You'll like this.
Let's see it.
KROLAK: Ah, Toby, you've already served time for one charge of juvenile rape now.
Statutory. The girl was 16 years old.
KROLAK: Toby, would you tell him that rape is rape?
You got three years of juvenile, you got some burglary.
You got some theft, grand theft.
KROLAK: The man likes his marijuana. Multiple counts of marijuana possession, Toby, and then that first rape.
Section Four. Man's got a mental handicap, Stan.
KROLAK: No.

Number two, l'm gonna get a confession.

You mean beaver or you mean "beaver"?
Beaver. Beaver? Pretty, young pussy?

You attacked and you raped her.
You raped that little girl.

You know, but sometimes you can't stop yourself, you know?
And you murdered her, didn't you?
Huh? That hurts right there, doesn't it?
Yeah? You like that, huh? (CHUCKLES)
You like that? Huh?
Toby, maybe you just wanted her to be quiet. Huh?
You just wanted her to stop screaming at you.
Something was stronger than you, Toby.

You were horrified.

Thank you very much. You're welcome.
Next in line, please.
Hi, how are you folks today?
Thank you. Going to Cabo San Lucas today.
Wadenah had been previously convicted of similar crimes, a repeat offender, still on parole.
Regarding the alleged suicide of the suspect while in custody,
state's attorney Paul Ross has organized an investigative committee
to look into the tactics of the Becker County Sheriff's Office. Now we turn to John Qulgley in Becker County. John?
You okay?
Hmm. Yes, thank you.
Sheriff's Department investigators worked in concert
with Reno homicide detectives for several hours,
piecing together the evidence trail that led to the brisk apprehension of Wadenah.
Authorities here, while understandably disturbed
by the brief hostage-taking of one of their deputies,
are taking some comfort
in the swift justice of this very dramatic evening. (AIRPLANE PASSING BY) (SLOT MACHINE WHIRRING AND DINGS)
(SIRENS WAILING) Yet, while an investigation is underway, the consensus seems clear.
Wadenah confessed after being identified by the young snowmobiler.
His suicide brought a brutal end...
WOMAN: (ON PA) Final boarding call, Northwest flight 1607 to Cabo San Lucas.
STORE CLERK: Customer, Oliver!
Morning. Morning.
Nice day today. Can we help you with anything? Anything in particular?
Well, actually, probably there is.
l'm looking for a person. Annalise, or Anna-Lisa Hansen.
Yes. She would live above the electric store.
That would be a small unit. lt's two doors down to your left.
Okay? And if l were you, I'd go around the corner and take the stairs up.
You shouldn't have any trouble finding her.
And if you don't, come back.
Thank you very much. l appreciate your help.
You're welcome.
ANNALISE: So, what is it that you need to know?
(SIGHS) Well, l'm trying to fill in the gaps, uh...
Fit all the pieces together, Mrs. Hansen.
(INHALES) lf you could remember anything
from when you were interviewed, uh...
Anything in particular that might, um...
It was Wednesday and she never came.
They said that she never got on the bus,
never even made it to the school.
Now, l assumed that she'd gone home.
And, uh, wh... What was she like, uh...
What were your Wednesdays with Ginny...
What were they like?
Oh, she would come in with her little knapsack
and plop it on the floor.
Give me a kiss on my cheek.
Big kiss, always my left cheek.
And then, it was time for work.
The moment she would sit at the piano,
we were all business.
And l would give her
her lesson just the same as all my other pupils.
And it was no "Grandma" this or "Grandma" that.
But the moment we were done,
she was my Ginny again.
How could God be so greedy?
Ma'am, l...
And after the lesson?
Cookies.
We would have cookies, if I'd baked them.
Or sometimes l would send her down to the Land of Christmas.
The store downstairs, for candy or ice cream.
She would eat her sweets and l would read to her.
She loved Andersen.
Who?
Do you know what he wrote in his story The Angel?
No. (CHUCKLES)
Here.
"Whenever a good child dies,
"an angel of God
"comes down from heaven
"and takes the child in his arms.
"And spreads out his great white wings.
"And flies with her
"over all the places
"that she loved during her life.
"And then, the child carries
"a large handful of flowers
"up to God."
Beautiful.
JERRY: What's your name?
Becky. Becky Fiske.
And you were Ginny's best friend?
We sat together.
She died.
Yeah. l know.
Her grandmother told me that Ginny liked to tell stories.
Sometimes.
What kind of stories?
Ginny knew a giant.
Giant?
Really?
He was as big as a mountain and gave her porcupines.
She called him "The Wizard."
Ginny made a picture of him.
Ginny drew a picture of a giant?
Can l see it?
lt's on the wall in the hallway.
We put Ginny's picture.
l gotta go.
Jean, hold my calls.
I thought you were supposed to be fishing in Mexico.
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT) I know, Stan.
l went to the airport.
l heard the boarding announcement. And I... I just didn't feel right.
And I... I just didn't feel right.
Something went off. l need more time on this.
You want me to reopen a case because you got a hunch?
(MOUTHING) Yeah. Jerry, no offense, but you're retired. You don't work here anymore.
Okay.
l know, Stan.
l know. But could you run it through the system for me anyway?
You know, just a standard query.
Similar crimes, profile, victims.
Could you?
Say, for...
The last 10, 12 years.
Could you, Stan?
Please?
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
MAN: This is eight years ago when this happened. (GROANS)
I'm on the job only six months at the point when this very big deal goes down.
Talk about baptism by fire.
And to top off everything else,
it was in the summer season.
"Politics of tourism" and all that nonsense.
So we all feel the pressure to make the bogeyman of it all disappear.
The brass were pretty clear in the presumption
that it was one of those festival-goers.
Which seemed like, you know, a pretty good bet.
Not to mention, a good way to diffuse the kind of panic that people get. You know, when they feel like there's a bogeyman amongst them.
You know, when they feel like there's a bogeyman amongst them.
(GROANS) So we all figured,
and l do feel accurately, that's why we never did catch him.
The odds were on a perpetrator
who'd cleared the county before the body was ever found.
Yeah.
Look at the slit in that neck.
I don't know, but for me...
For me, it's like being in a movie.
This stuff just doesn't bother me like it does some people. You?
Luanne Rotze.
A little 10-year-old girl.
Real little. l mean, real small for her age.
You know what, though?
As horrible as that kind of thing is,
l got an adrenaline rush being part of it.
I don't know if that's bad, but, hey, don't hurt me.
That's just the way it hit me.
Nothing like it ever happened before in that area.
By the way, nothing like it ever happened since.
And l think that says a lot.
You mind if l keep this one? I couldn't let you do that.
We always like to be of help, but
strictly technically, the case is still open.
Well, then how about the report?
I'll make you a copy. How's that?
Sure would appreciate it.
But keep it between us.
I'm not sure what the policy is on this kind of thing. Okay?
My lips are sealed.
Lucy!
A two-year-old horse is like a woman. You can't predict what they're gonna do.
They're crazy.
Excuse me. Sir?
Sir?
Sir? I wonder if you could tell me where a man named James Olstad might be?
Olstad's not a patient here.
Oh. Well, l believe he's the custodian, sir.
Maybe in the building, mopping? But he's not a patient here.
Mopping in the building? Yeah, but not a patient here.
James Olstad?
I'm Jerry Black. I'm a police detective.
I'd just like to talk to you about your daughter.
What daughter?
You did have a daughter that went missing three years ago, didn't you?
Did you come here to tell me that, uh, something happened to her?
No, sir. lt was...
Did you find her dead or something?
No. No, sir. We're, uh...
We're still trying to find her.
Anything you might tell me about her?
Could you describe her?
She must be...
She must be different now.
She was so pretty.
I miss her so much! (SOBBING)
We just used to, like, hold each other.
I was supposed to take care of her.
She was my little girl, you know? (SNIFFLES)
I just...
Where is my little girl?
Where is my baby?
The break is Monash County. Eight years ago, we got a homicide.
Same MO.
Exact same victim profile description as the Ginny Larsen case.
I interviewed one of the local officers for the particulars.
Little blonde girl, 10 years old, sexual assault, throat slit.
The photos show that she was wearing a red dress.
Detectives out at Morehead covered this case. The case is still open.
At the time of the murders,
Toby Wadenah was in Stillwater Penitentiary,
doing time on his own rape conviction.
So, he couldn't have done it. Jerry, the man shot himself.
Jerry, the man shot himself. What more do you want? You told him what he did and he believed you.
What more do you want? You told him what he did and he believed you. All right, let's just calm down here a minute and see what Jerry's got. You got something, Jerry?
And there's more. More.
Here. See here?
This is the Larsen murder. This is the Monash County girl. And here...
Here, you see this pattern?
Three years ago, l got a girl gone missing, Cathy Olstad.
Same exact description, a little blonde girl, nine years old,
last seen wearing a red dress.
And?
And?
Don't you see?
I see you've given a description that could fit any number of juvenile murders.
And a victim profile that matches every other little girl in the state, just about,
give or take the red dress.
I mean, why didn't you mention that her eyes were blue while you were at it? Come on, Jerry!
I mean, whatever made you think
that the Larsen girl wasn't murdered by Wadenah?
This did.
This convinced me.
Ginny's drawing of the Porcupine Giant.
I have reason to believe, based on my conversations and interviews,
that Ginny Larsen made this drawing just days before she was murdered.
I have reason to believe that she was meeting with this man,
seen here as a giant, all dressed in black, on a regular basis.
This is not an lndian. This is not an lndian type.
And you see this car here? This big, black car?
This is not a truck.
This is not a maroon truck like Wadenah drove.
This is a big, black station wagon.
And these right here, these, according to an interview l had
with a girl named Beck... (STAMMERS) Betsy Fiske, these are porcupines.
Betsy Fiske, these are porcupines. Okay. Whoa! Hold it.
Porcupines and giants and...
You got to get ahold of yourself, Jerry.
The case is closed.
I made a promise.
I made a promise to find
Ginny Larsen's murderer.
I intend to keep it.
Listen, Jerry. (DOOR CLOSES)
You gotta start getting on with your life, you know?
I mean, sometimes when you go through big changes,
and retirement's definitely one of them,
it can cause a lot of added stress.
Sometimes it's a good idea just to
talk to someone. You know, someone
professional.
I made a promise, Eric.
You're old enough to remember when that meant something.
(SIGHS) Get a life.
WOMAN: Jerry, got your fresh towels here!
Most folks don't need them every day.
But I'd appreciate it if you'd not get them so dirty that they're not to be white again.
Here's your nice little sunroom. You can smoke in here.
This is the living room area. No partying, please, no.
Kitchen, of course. All the amenities of home.
Bedroom. We just put a new mattress on there. So it should be really comfy.
And, oh, yeah, trash goes in the covered dumpster.
And fish guts you gotta wrap and place in the covered pail next to the cleaning station.
Rules and regulations of Sugar Bush up here. Yep.
And no nude sunbathing.
So, l'll leave these here and I'll get Rose to come make up your bed.
If there's anything else you'll be needing, just let me know. Okeydokey?
Good morning.
I'll have a pack of lights.
That the owner?
My daddy.
What can l do for you?
Well, l was just having a look around.
How long you had this place?
Oh, 30 years.
Ever think about selling it?
No.
Well, uh, gee. What would it take to get you to think about selling?
(CLEARS THROAT) lt's not for sale. (CHUCKLES)
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you my number over where l'm staying.
At Thompson's Sugar Bush Resort.
I don't mean to be pushy, but...
If you'd think about it...
I'll wait to hear from you over at Thompson's, if it's all right.
Been a pleasure. Thanks for coming in.
Nice place.
RESORT OWNER: You didn't tell me you were a cop!
Ex-cop. Ha! Once a cop...
I'm retired.
Uh, what l wanted to tell you was that Floyd Cage called.
The fellow with the gas station. He says he wants to talk to you. Oh.
l see they're biting.
You bet. Sure does look like it.
You can use the phone up in the front cabin here.
Thank you.
Well, Floyd, Jerry signed all the papers. You're ready to go.
Well, l sure appreciate it. You've done a good job.
Good luck.
When we get a number down in Arizona, we'll give you a call, leave you our number.
I'm going to Arizona!
So if you forget something or want to know where something is,
So if you forget something or want to know where something is, or whatever...
Good luck to you. JERRY: Thank you.
WOMAN: Sure hope you're gonna be happy here.
'Cause you're never gonna be able to sell this place for what you paid for it.
Well, thank you, I'll do my best.
DRIVER: Hey, is this working or what?
I just have to get a key. I'll be right with you. Thank you.
LORI: Be right with you. JERRY: Thank you.
LORI: What can l get you?
Just a beer, thanks.
You're the city cop that bought the service station?
I'm retired from the police department.
And you bought Floyd's station?
l did.
That's a strange thing to do. You must be an angler.
How'd you guess? (LAUGHS) Nothing else to do around here.
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
These only work about half the time.
All right, just sign right there for me, if you would.
JERRY: That's for you.
Thank you and...
Here's your receipt. Thank you, sir. Have a good day.
All right, 10 regular.
Nice wagon. Sticks out around here though, doesn't it?
Never thought about it being different. (CHUCKLING)
Just know I always get them black, so they don't show the dirt as much.
Ten it is. Well, thanks for stopping by. (ENGINE STARTING)
ANNALISE: " Whenever a good child dies,
"an angel of God comes down from heaven
"and takes the dead child in his arms.
"And spreads out his great white wings.
"And flies with her
"over all the places that she loved in her life."
DOCTOR: And what do you feel is represented here?
Well, the porcupine giant. Ginny told her friends at school
that she was meeting with a giant in the forest
and that he gave her little porcupines.
What do you mean? You see these... Hmm?
What do you mean by "porcupines"?
l don't know exactly.
Those are the words of a 7-year-old girl.
Ginny's friends. Friend, sorry.
And this is in the imagination of a 7-year-old girl. Correct?
you could be right. But...
On the other hand, the car is very well depicted,
and the giant is... Giants are imaginary.
Yes?
a tall, heavyset man could appear
to be a giant to a little girl.
And the Indian man, was he a tall man?
not a giant, but tall, yes.
Why did you bring this to me, Mr. Black?
Sorry?
Why did you bring this to me, Mr. Black?
I need to know who I'm looking for.
I'm like a layman looking at an X-ray.
l don't know how to read it. l need help interpreting it.
This drawing can tell you nothing about
the murderer. All that drawing can do is tell you about the child who drew it.
Without more information, l don't think l can be of any value to you.
Humor me, Doc.
Consider this a working hypothesis and assume for the moment
that this is a drawing of the murderer.
Well,
your giant certainly looks tall, massive,
very imposing.
If this really does depict the relationship between the giant and the little girl,
then these things you call porcupines would appear to be gifts
then these things you call porcupines would appear to be gifts that the little girl is accepting.
That's implying a trust.
Was the girl in Monash County killed the same way?
Exactly the same.
Do the victims resemble one another?
Yes, a lot.
And what did you say the time intervals were between the murders?
The Monash County case was eight years ago.
The little girl missing, three,
and Ginny was just... Just last winter.
So the intervals are getting shorter.
lf that's the case, then yes, you could...
Remember, this is a hypothetical case.
Mmm-hmm. But yes, you could expect another incident within...
A matter of months.
Maybe a year, if the opportunity arose.
But this could just as well be the product
of a 7-year-old child's imagination.
Right.
You came to me for help.
Yes. Do you mind if l ask you some questions?
Shoot.
You recently retired, right?
Yes.
Have you always been a chain smoker?
MARGARET: Impossible. There can't be such a devil.
You always been a chain smoker? JERRY: Yes, there are such devils.
Recent. Recent.
MARGARET: Do you swear... Are you still sexually active?
MARGARET: By your soul's salvation...
Are you still sexually active?
Are you still sexually active?
JERRY: Yes, on my soul's salvation. Does that embarrass you?
Have you experienced any...
Have you experienced any sudden fevers, perspiration?
No. POLLACK: Got to get ahold of yourself, Jerry.
Or voices. Do you hear voices?
TOBY: I kill the girl. I kill the girl. KROLAK: No, goddamn it! No!

to the little fishies.

Thanks, doll. MAN 2: l could use a little fresh-up too.
Boy. Nice picture.
Thank you.
Aren't you gonna finish your orange juice?
Mommy.
Oh, hi, Officer. It's okay, honey, he's a friend.
Pack up, 'cause the bus is coming. Any coffee?
Yes, please.
And what name would a pretty little girl like you have?
Chrissy.
(BUS HONKING) That's a nice name.
Okay, love bug, this is it. Come on, let's go.
Bye. Can l have a hug?
Have a good day.
Beautiful little girl. Oh, thank you.
JERRY: How old is she?
She'll be eight next month. First day of school's always a biggie.
Oh, l forgot your coffee. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
There you go. Oh, thank you.
Want some breakfast? Yeah.
I'd like bacon and eggs and...
How do you like your eggs? Over easy. And rye toast.
Okay. l got a question for you.
Fire away.
Where would an old bachelor like me find some used furniture?
Nothing too fancy, you know. A couch, dinette set.
Something between the not-too-expensive and poverty-stricken range.
My range. Um... (CHUCKLES)
There's a flea market up...
You go right up this road, Old Pass Road. Go north about 20, 25 miles up here.
And you're gonna hit a T-junction.
And once you get past a T-junction, it's gonna fork into two roads, two dirt roads.
There's no sign or anything that locals... Do you like shopping?
Mommy, can l have a balloon? Yeah.
What color do you want? Here, here, l got it.
Orange.
Orange. There you go. Well, you got pink.
That's okay. Pink? l like pink, too.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
l'm looking for Formica here. (BOTH CHUCKLE)
lt wipes easy. That won't be a problem.
Ah, well, uh, what about this one right here? WOMAN: I think this gives a room a very warm feeling.
Now, this one's oak veneer. Veneer, huh? WOMAN: Yeah.
I can take five dollars off the top. JERRY: And what would that bring the total to?
Where's Chrissy?
Chrissy?
Where is she? She, she was just right here. Chrissy!
I'll get back to you.
Chrissy!
Chrissy!
She's on the swing.
Bye. LORI: Chrissy!
(SIGHS) Don't leave me like that. Mommy, that girl gave this to me.
lsn't it cute?
What is it?
WOMAN: It's a boot cleaner in the shape of a porcupine. lt's made by one of our local craft artists.
She makes doormats, too. Here, you want to come see?
HELEN: Fifteen apiece for the little fellows, 25 for the big. (WHIRRING)
The mats are 10 bucks even.
You don't run this whole place yourself, do you?
Are you a religious man, Mr. Black?
Um, baptized. But l'm not churchgoing.
You got a wife?
Two-time loser. What about you, ma'am?
My son, Gary, is the true gift of the Lord.
He dotes on me hand and foot, he does!
The hardest working boy you ever saw.
Works construction all summer.
Runs a snowplow for the county in the winter.
And ministers at our church.
Hmm. And, uh... What about him? Does he have a family, uh... Kids?
HELEN: No wife, no kids. No little ones.
I pray every day
he'll find a woman good enough for him.
The Lord hasn't come through yet.
God bless.
Closed!
l'm closed! (KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Yeah, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
Closed.
Lori?
Woman, what has happened to you? Come in. (SOBBING) So... Sorry.
(SOBBING) So... Sorry.
My ex... And I was just so scared. He was gonna kill me!
lt's all right. lt's all right. Shh. Shh.
(SOBBING) And you being a cop... Where's Chrissy? She's in the car.
Where's Chrissy? She's in the car. No, no, l got it. l got it.
Oh, no, no, no. But she's okay. It's all right, I'll take care of her. He didn't touch her. No. No. He didn't touch her.
LORI: With a restraining order, he's still gonna beat me up. JERRY: Mmm-hmm.
LORI: And then they put him in jail for it. He won't be able to pay child support payments. JERRY: All right.
That's why he's beatin' me up to begin with.
Ow. (INHALES) Uh-huh.
(SHUSHING) Just hold still. Uh-huh.
All right, this might...
All right, that's okay now.
Just hold still for a minute. (GASPING) All right. 'Cause this one might sting a little bit. Okay? (PANTS) Yeah. All right. Just hold still.
(PANTS) Yeah. All right. Just hold still. All right.
(GASPS) Right here, that's it. All right, hold still, that's it. Oh.
That's it. All right, all right, okay. (SIGHS) All right.
Yeah. (MOANS)
Yeah. Well, your eye looks okay.
(MUMBLES) I'm not sure you might not want to think about getting a stitch in that lip.
(SIGHS) I'm gonna miss that, uh, half-tooth of yours.
I'll drink out of this side for a while, anyway.
Listen, uh... Lori,
all things considered,
l think it might be best if you and your girl
stayed out here with me for a while.
That's not why I came here. Just hear me out.
No strings attached, no obligations, uh...
But I've seen these things go from bad to worse.
Now I've got more rooms out here than I know what to do with.
l wouldn't ask anything of you.
Except maybe help out around the station every once in a while,
Except maybe help out around the station every once in a while, you know, when you're feeling better.
just, uh, think about it.
Just think about it.
JERRY: Mine's up here at the top. (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)
Mommy, this house is so big!
You got a whole new one, right? Yeah, that whole...
ls it real?
Well, it's not real. (LAUGHS) It's called a cap.

Backhander deflected by Jackson. Another backhander...
GARY: Nice snowman you got going there.
Does he have a name?
Should l guess?
If I guess, will you tell me your name?
He looks cold. Do you want to put my hat on him?
Goal.
Has your mommy talked to you about the Word?
Do you know what I mean by that?
BUS DRIVER: Merry Christmas, Chrissy. Merry Christmas.
JERRY: There she is!
(LAUGHS) Yeah!
(LAUGHS) How are you? Good.
(CHUCKLES) Come on.
"She knew the mole would never permit her to leave his side.
"She wept as she felt the warmth upon her face.
"and made ready to go back.
"Then suddenly, above the hill, she heard a shower of notes.
"A glorious morning song. "She looked up, and there was the swallow.
"She looked up, and there was the swallow.
"She told the bird how she disliked
"having to marry the ugly mole "and live deep down under the earth,
"where the sun never shone.
"She couldn't help crying at the thought.
"'The cold winter will soon be here,' said the swallow.
"'l'm going far away to the warm countries. "'Will you come with me?
"'You can sit on my back. "'Just tie yourself on with your sash,
"'and we'll fly from the ugly mole and his dingy house,
"'far away, across the mountains,

"'where the sun shines more brightly than it does here,
"'and it's always summer, with its lovely flowers.
"'Dear little Thumbelina.'"
Lori?
Are you all right?
Here, hon. Oh.
Chrissy is gonna go nuts when she sees this. This is so neat, Jerry.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. She'll like it.
LORI: She'll love it.
You sure you want it here, though, Jerry? It's so close to the road.
We got all that space back behind the house over there.
Well, we can see her right from the station. We should keep our eye on her, you know?
We should keep our eye on her, you know?
Out back... (SIGHS)
There's all that space, you know.
I mean, she could just disappear, you know?
No, you're right.
You think?
You're probably right.
l'll get that.
Yeah, she's gonna love it. (CHUCKLES)
CHRISSY: Mommy, l like this one.
LORI: Yeah?
Well, it's nice.
Uh, Jerry, what do you think of this?
Well, uh, real nice. Yeah?
I mean, it's not really your taste, sugar.
lt is her color. You like it?
lt is her color. You like it? l like it.
Yeah? Let's see how this looks to you. Oh, no. (CHUCKLES) LORI: Yee-haw.
JERRY: Come on, Tex.
You only have chocolate? That's all. CHRISSY: Thank you.
JERRY: Let's have three of them.
LORI: Did you see that? (CHUCKLES)
LORI: lsn't he at your school? CHRISSY: Yeah.
CHRISSY: Thump, thump, thump.
JERRY: "They heard the giant's footsteps.
"As quick as a wink, the lad once again hid in the oven.
"In came the giant for the second time and he bellowed... Fe...
Fi. Fo!

BOTH: "'l smell the blood of an Englishman.
"'Be he alive or be he dead.
"'l'll grind his bones

Here you are, sir. A buck-fifty is your change.
Okay, thank you. There's your receipt.
Thanks for stopping by. See you again, yeah?
CHRISSY: Jerry!
Look what Gary gave me!
lt's glow-in-the-dark so that Jesus can always be with me. Uh-huh.
Can you push me on the swings?
Yeah. What did Mr. Jackson want, Chrissy?
He invited me to his church. You think Mommy will let me go?
Well, honey, you know,
a lot of people believe a lot of different things.
Some people believe that the stories in the Bible are real, and some think they're like your fairy tales,
and some think they're like your fairy tales, where the giants aren't really real.
Chrissy, l want you to promise me something.
If anybody tries to talk to you, any man...
Whether it's Mr. Jackson or not.
Especially if it's a big, tall man,
I want you to tell me, all right?
Promise me that you'll tell me, honey.
l promise.
All right, honey.
Could you push me on the swings now?
Yeah. All right. Give me your tootsies.
Here we go.
Lori. LORI: Hi.
Oh, wow! (LAUGHS)
Hold the roast, honey. Let's eat these.
Those are beauties. Let me clean up the sink here for you. I can't wait to tell her about the size of this bully here.
Chrissy! Oh. She's not here. The Jacksons came over to take her to church.
Who? Put those in there.
Jackson? You know, that "Bless the Children" Day? She's been asking me... You let Jackson... Oh, Jesus. What?
(CLATTERS)
What? Jerry! No, l...
l, uh, I told her that l'd go to church with her. We were talking about the Bible yesterday.
l'm just gonna go try and go by. For God's sakes, it's just church!
For God's sakes, it's just church!
You're gonna give yourself a heart attack, Jerry!
Come on! Move it.
Oh, God, no! No!
Welcome to the House of Our Lord.
May Jesus be with you.
ALL: May Jesus be with you.
CHRISSY: Jerry!
Jerry!
Yes, hon. What is it?
l can't sleep. Could you read me a story?
Another story?
Please?
Well, all right.
(INHALES SHARPLY) But just a short one. Scooch over.
Let's see what we got here.
We've got...
The Elves and the Shoemaker.
We've got... l met The Wizard today.
What?
l had to promise not to tell my parents. So you can't tell Mommy
So you can't tell Mommy or he'll be very angry with me and never come back again.
Uh, Chrissy, l... (CLICKS TONGUE) l don't believe you.
(CLICKS TONGUE) l don't believe you.
Wizards don't exist.
No, Jerry, you're wrong. And l can prove it. Huh. You can, huh?
Huh. You can, huh?
He gave me these.
They're yummy.
But you can't have them, Jerry. (CHUCKLING)
He said he'd give me more tomorrow.
Huh? Tomorrow. Uh, where?
(WHISPERING) At the picnic grounds. Aren't they cute?
My itty-bitty baby porcupines.
The Wizard said they came from a land far, far away.
Jerry, can l go see The Wizard tomorrow?
Well, he seems like such a nice wizard.
l don't see why not.
But let's keep this our secret.
Thank you, Jerry.
KROLAK: (OVER RADIO) Strom, how's your position?
l'm in position right across the river from you, Stan.
(OVER RADIO) We've got a clear view of the little girl at the picnic ground.
You're out of position.
KROLAK: What? You should be over closer.
KROLAK: Jerry, we got a whole SWAT team out here doing you a big favor. (SIGHS) Just stay where you are.
(SIGHS) Just stay where you are.
(HUMS) KROLAK: (OVER RADIO) Snipers one and two, recheck your fields of fire.
KROLAK: Jerry? He's coming.
What's the matter with you?
l'm fine, Stan. (SNICKERS)
CHRISSY: Want some tea?
You're very thirsty today, aren't you?
STORE CLERK: Oliver!
Oliver!
Where did you hide them chocolates, Oliver?
Oh, there's some porcupines!
l'm just gonna go down to the water for a minute.
(BREATHES DEEPLY) ls this guy really coming?
Strom, Jerry's coming towards you right now, across the river.
STROM: Yeah, l got him. What the hell is he doing? Jesus Christ, l have no idea.
This may have been a mistake, Stan.
Hold him, l'll be right there.
He had big, big eggs and...
So he went up to the eggs, and it started shaking.
l don't know.
What's going on?
Jerry? STROM: Okay, guys. Hold your positions.
(STAMMERS) Stan, we're out of position.
Jerry, l got eight guys out here, hung up, doing you a big favor.
You don't know what you're fucking dealing with here. I know this guy is real. Jerry, this is...
You understand? You don't know what you're dealing with here.
This guy is real, and l know it.
There's no Wizard, Jerry.
We got our man a year-and-a-half ago. Toby Wadenah.
You're making this real difficult for me.
What, Stan?
We're calling it quits.
Calling it quits. We're outta here.
lt's over. That's it.
Okay, Stan.
You do what you gotta do.
l'll do what l gotta do.
Just when you leave, don't compromise this operation.
You understand me?
Come on.
Jerry's staying on, so do your best not to engage the girl.
STROM: Okay, guys. We are pulling out.
l want you to know l have to tell the mother.
RUDY: Wish you'd have known Jerry 20 years ago. STROM: Whew.
He was a good cop.
He was a great cop.
Just, it's... It's just sad.
He's become a drunk and a clown.
Fucking clown.
LORI: Chrissy!
Oh, my God, baby!
Oh, my God!
Mommy, no! No, let's go. No, Mommy. No, let's go.
No, Mommy. (PANTING)
No! No! Chrissy, stop it. Let's go.
Jerry! Jerry!
Get in the car. I want my bike and my dolly.
Damn it, go!
LORI: Get in the car, now.
l want my bike!
Get in the car!
You fucking bastard, Jerry.
How could you do it to Chrissy?
Why would you do it to her?
(SOBS) She's eight years old, Jerry!
She's only eight years old!
She could have been killed!
Fucking
bastard!
Fucking crazy!
Why were you pretending
the whole time that you loved her and, that we were starting this life together?
You fucking bastard.
You're fucking crazy.
STROM: Oh, boy. This was a bad one.
Jesus.
KROLAK: Poor bastard.
JERRY: He's coming.
He's coming.
He's coming.
He is.
I know it.
She said it.
I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING EXTRA IF YOU MAKE IT A GOOD TRIP!
I'M GONNA GET YOU CLOSE, MY FRIEND, BUT NOT TOO CLOSE. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE EATEN.
- YOU READY, AMIGO? - [ Both ] READY!
ONE, TWO, THREE!
UH-UH, THIS IS GREAT! SCARED?
SEE ANYTHING YET? NO, NOT YET.
WHAT WAS THAT? WHOA!
I DON'T KNOW.
[ Boat Engine Sputtering ] HOLD ON. [ Boy ] WHAT'S HAPPENING? [ Man ] HOLD ON!
[ Boy ] WHAT'S HAPPENING? [ Man ] HOLD ON!
[ Groaning ] MAKE IT STOP!
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM? I DON'T KNOW.
OH, MY GOD!
WE'RE GONNA CRASH! WE'RE GONNA CRASH! NO, WE'RE NOT.
I'M GONNA CUT THIS LOOSE! LET GO OF THE ROPE! WE'RE GONNA CRASH!
- MOVE YOUR HANDS. - [ Crying ] COME ON!
HERE WE GO!
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, BUD.
ACTUALLY, THOSE ARE HERBIVORES. THEY WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED IN FIGHTING EACH OTHER.
ACTUALLY, THOSE ARE HERBIVORES. THEY WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED IN FIGHTING EACH OTHER. BUT THESE ARE CARNIVORES, AND THEY REALLY LIKE FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER.
THEY USE THEIR TEETH AND CLAWS TO RIP EACH OTHER'S THROATS OUT.
ALAN, HE'S THREE. LET'S WAIT TILL HE'S FIVE.
OH, RIGHT. SORRY, CHARLIE.
OH, RIGHT. SORRY, CHARLIE. ELLIE, IT'S TOM AGAIN. HE HAS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE LAST CHAPTER.
ELLIE, IT'S TOM AGAIN. HE HAS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE LAST CHAPTER.
JUST TELL HIM I'M NOT GONNA LOSE THE JACK HORNER QUOTE.
MY EDITOR THINKS HE'S A PALEONTOLOGIST. HEY, MARK. HEY, BABE, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
HEY, MARK. HEY, BABE, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
THIS IS ALAN.
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU, ALAN.
DADDY, THIS IS A HERBIVORE... I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU. AND THAT'S THE DINOSAUR MAN. DINOSAUR MAN?
AND THAT'S THE DINOSAUR MAN. DINOSAUR MAN?
JACK, SAY MY NAME. IS MY NAME ALAN?
IS MY NAME ALAN?
HE USED TO KNOW ME.
[ Laughing ] IT'S SAD.
HERE YOU GO. THANKS.
SO YOU KNOW MARK'S WORKING FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT NOW.
YEAH. WHAT DO YOU DO, MARK?
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, MOSTLY TREATY LAW AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
[ Baby Crying ] UH-OH. CALL OF THE WILD ONE.
HERE, I'LL GET HER. YOU GUYS... CATCH UP.
THANKS, BABE.
HE'S A GREAT GUY. SO, WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON NOW?
HE'S A GREAT GUY. SO, WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON NOW? RAPTORS, MOSTLY. MY FAVORITE.
RAPTORS, MOSTLY. MY FAVORITE.
DO YOU REMEMBER THE SOUNDS THEY MADE?
I TRY NOT TO.
ELLIE, ALL OUR THEORIES ABOUT RAPTOR INTELLIGENCE, WHAT THEY WERE CAPABLE OF-- WE WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE.
WHAT THEY WERE CAPABLE OF-- WE WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE.
WE DID CRANIAL SCANS OF A FOSSIL SKULL. TELL ME.
WE FOUND WHAT LOOKS LIKE A VERY SOPHISTICATED RESONATING CHAMBER.
SO WE WERE RIGHT? THEY HAD THE ABILITY TO VOCALIZE?
I'M CONVINCED THAT'S THE KEY TO THEIR SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE.
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THEY COULD WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM.
AND COORDINATE THEIR ATTACKS SO THE PREY WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.
- THEY COULD TALK TO EACH OTHER. - TO A DEGREE WE NEVER IMAGINED.
- [ Sighs ] - ELLIE, THEY WERE SMART.
THEY WERE SMARTER THAN DOLPHINS OR WHALES.
THEY WERE SMARTER THAN PRIMATES.
I JUST WANT TO SAY, IF YOU EVER NEED HELP WITH ANYTHING--
SOMETIMES YOU FORGET TO ASK.
SO YOU CAN CALL ME.
SURE. ANYTHING, ANYTIME.
YOU'RE STILL THE BEST.
I MEAN THAT.
THE LAST OF MY BREED.
[ Alan's Voice ] THROUGH THE PAINSTAKING STUDY OF THE ANTERIOR CHAMBER... IN MULTIPLE SPECIMENS, WE CAN DETERMINE THE EXCITING CORRELATION...
IN MULTIPLE SPECIMENS, WE CAN DETERMINE THE EXCITING CORRELATION... BETWEEN THE UPPER PALATE AND THE LARYNX.
THIS LETS US THEORIZE-- THEORIZE, MIND YOU-- THAT THE RAPTOR WAS CAPABLE OF SOPHISTICATED VOCALIZATIONS...
THAT THE RAPTOR WAS CAPABLE OF SOPHISTICATED VOCALIZATIONS...
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A TREMENDOUS EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE.
RAPTORS WERE FIERCE, INTELLIGENT AND SOCIALLY SOPHISTICATED.
THEY WERE ABLE TO HUNT IN NUMBERS... AND COORDINATE THEIR EFFORTS.
WERE IT NOT FOR THE CATACLYSMIC EVENTS WHICH OVERTOOK THEM,
IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT RAPTORS RATHER THAN HUMANS...
WOULD HAVE BECOME THE DOMINANT SPECIES ON THIS PLANET.
I HOPE THIS HAS BEEN OF INTEREST.
IT CERTAINLY EXCITES US AS PALEONTOLOGISTS.
SORRY. THERE'S MUCH, MUCH MORE TO DISCOVER.
THAT IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO NEED AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DR. GRANT.
NOW, DOES ANYONE HAVE A QUESTION?
FINE. DOES ANYONE HAVE A QUESTION THAT DOES NOT RELATE TO JURASSIC PARK?
OR THE INCIDENT IN SAN DIEGO... WHICH I DID NOT WITNESS?
YES, SIR?
YOUR THEORY ON RAPTORS IS GOOD AND ALL, BUT ISN'T ALL THIS CONJECTURE MOOT?
ONCE THE U.N. AND COSTA RICA AND EVERYONE DECIDES HOW TO HANDLE THAT SECOND ISLAND,
SCIENTISTS WILL JUST GO IN AND LOOK FOR THEMSELVES.
DINOSAURS LIVED 65 MILLION YEARS AGO.
WHAT IS LEFT OF THEM IS FOSSILIZED IN THE ROCKS.
AND IT IS IN THE ROCK THAT REAL SCIENTISTS MAKE REAL DISCOVERIES.
NOW, WHAT JOHN HAMMOND AND INGEN DID AT JURASSIC PARK...
IS CREATE GENETICALLY ENGINEERED THEME PARK MONSTERS,
NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS.
ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO GET ONTO ISLA SORNA... AND STUDY THEM, IF YOU HAD THE CHANCE?
NO FORCE ON EARTH OR HEAVEN COULD GET ME ON THAT ISLAND.
SO, WHAT WE GOT HERE, NASHY?

WE'RE GOOD TO GO HERE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I CAN LOCK THINGS DOWN JUST AS SOON AS YOU DROP ME THAT PAYMENT.
WELL, THAT'S RIGHT. TWO OF THE VERY BEST MEN I COULD POSSIBLY FIND.
WELL, THAT'S RIGHT. TWO OF THE VERY BEST MEN I COULD POSSIBLY FIND. HAVE YOU WORKED WITH THESE MEN? NO, SIR, I HAVEN'T WORKED WITH THEM PERSONALLY.
HAVE YOU WORKED WITH THESE MEN? NO, SIR, I HAVEN'T WORKED WITH THEM PERSONALLY.
BUT, BELIEVE ME, SIR, BOTH OF THESE MEN COME VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
[ Paul ] ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, SIR.
IT'S GONNA BE A WALK IN THE PARK.
BILLY, I DON'T THINK I'M DOING THIS RIGHT.
LET'S TRY THE TOOTHBRUSH.
YOU GOT TO GO SLOWLY.
JUST TAKE A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME.
I CAN NEVER TELL WHAT'S ROCK AND WHAT'S BONE. TECHNICALLY, IT'S ALL ROCK.
TECHNICALLY, IT'S ALL ROCK.
THE CALCIUM IN THE BONES IS REPLACED DURING FOSSILIZATION.
BUT YOU CAN FEEL THE DIFFERENCE. SEE?
ROUGH... SMOOTH.
ROUGH, SMOOTH.
DR. GRANT.
MR. BRENNAN.
SO, HOW'D IT GO?
WELL, IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO CHANGE YOUR MAJOR, BILLY.
NOT GOOD, HUH? WORSE.
NOT GOOD, HUH? WORSE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PACK UP IN FOUR WEEKS. THREE.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PACK UP IN FOUR WEEKS. THREE.
I HAD TO RENT EQUIPMENT. COME HERE, I GOTTA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
I LIKE THE ABACUS, BILLY. YOU LIKE COMPUTERS, RIGHT?
MEET THE FUTURE OF PALEONTOLOGY. IT'S A RAPID PROTOTYPER.
I ENTER IN THE SCAN DATA FROM THE RAPTOR'S SKULL.
THE COMPUTER BREAKS IT DOWN INTO THOUSANDS OF SLICES.
THEN THIS THING SCULPTS IT, ONE LAYER AT A TIME. IT'S DONE. [ Beeps ]
IT'S DONE. [ Beeps ]
I GIVE YOU THE RESONATING CHAMBER OF A VELOCIRAPTOR.
LISTEN TO THIS.
WOW. THIS IS BRILLIANT, BILLY. REALLY, IT IS.
SAD TO SAY, IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT LATE. [ Footsteps Approaching ]
DR. GRANT? PAUL KIRBY. KIRBY ENTERPRISES.
UH, MY CARD. HOW YOU DOING, BILLY?
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, MR. KIRBY?
WELL, UM, FIRST THING, I'M A GREAT ADMIRER OF YOURS,
AND I HAVE A PROPOSITION I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.
WOULD YOU HAVE DINNER WITH MY WIFE AND ME THIS EVENING? IT'LL BE OUR TREAT.
WELL, THAT'D BE GREAT, BUT I'M TIRED. I'VE BEEN TRAVELING.
BELIEVE ME, THIS WILL BE WORTH YOUR WHILE. MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME.
WE'D LOVE TO. OH, TERRIFIC.
THAT'S THE SPIRIT. GOOD. THIS EVENING THEN.
OH, BILLY. DR. GRANT. HOW ARE YOU? MRS. KIRBY, HOW ARE YOU? AMANDA, BILLY.
SO WHAT ARE YOU BOYS DRINKING?
ICE PICK, CATFISH. TWO, PLEASE, CAT.
ICE PICK, CATFISH. TWO, PLEASE, CAT. REALLY TRULY INSPIRING. WE'VE ADMIRED YOUR WORK FOR YEARS.
REALLY TRULY INSPIRING. WE'VE ADMIRED YOUR WORK FOR YEARS.
AMANDA AND I JUST LOVE THE OUTDOORS.
HECK, WE'VE BEEN ON JUST ABOUT EVERY ADVENTURE TOUR THEY CAN COME UP WITH.
THE NILE, GALAPAGOS, K2.
WE EVEN HAVE TWO SEATS RESERVED ON THE FIRST COMMERCIAL FLIGHT TO THE MOON.
AND FOR OUR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL.
ONCE IN A LIFETIME. SOMETHING-- SO...
ONCE IN A LIFETIME. SOMETHING-- SO... I'VE CHARTERED AN AIRPLANE TO FLY US OVER ISLA SORNA...
AND WE'D LIKE YOU TO BE OUR GUIDE.
THERE YOU GO, GUYS.
THAT'S A VERY KIND OFFER, MR. KIRBY, BUT I'M A VERY, VERY BUSY MAN.
THAT'S A VERY KIND OFFER, MR. KIRBY, BUT I'M A VERY, VERY BUSY MAN. I CAN RECOMMEND A COUPLE OF GUYS WHO ARE REALLY HIGHLY QUALIFIED THAT--
NO, NO, NO. YOU'RE THE BEST. YOU'VE SEEN THESE ANIMALS IN THE FLESH. THERE'S NO ONE THAT EVEN COMES CLOSE TO YOU.
YOU'VE SEEN THESE ANIMALS IN THE FLESH. THERE'S NO ONE THAT EVEN COMES CLOSE TO YOU.
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FLY LOW ENOUGH TO SEE ANYTHING OF ANY REAL INTEREST.
WELL, SEE? THAT'S THE INTERESTING PART... BECAUSE WE HAVE PERMISSION TO FLY LOW.
[ Billy ] HOW LOW? I'M NO AVIATION EXPERT,
[ Billy ] HOW LOW? I'M NO AVIATION EXPERT, BUT A HECK OF A LOT LOWER THAN ANYBODY ELSE, I CAN TELL YOU.
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, IT'S PRETTY MUCH-- IT'S WHATEVER WE WANT.
THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. YOU SEE, THROUGH MY BUSINESS DEALINGS--
THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. YOU SEE, THROUGH MY BUSINESS DEALINGS-- IMPORT, EXPORT, EMERGING MARKETS--
I'VE MADE A LOT OF FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES.
IN THIS CASE, THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT.
DR. GRANT, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO US THAT YOU COME ALONG.
MRS. KIRBY, I-I-- IT WOULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
MRS. KIRBY, I-I-- IT WOULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. AND, OF COURSE, WE'D LOVE TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO YOUR RESEARCH HERE. SO--
I COULD WRITE ALL KINDS OF NUMBERS ON THIS CHECK, DR. GRANT.
TELL ME...
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE?
EVEN WITH WHAT I PAY YOU, COULDN'T YOU AFFORD A BETTER BAG?
NO WAY. THIS ONE'S LUCKY.
A COUPLE YEARS AGO, SOME BUDDIES AND I... WENT HANG GLIDING OFF THESE CLIFFS IN NEW ZEALAND...
WENT HANG GLIDING OFF THESE CLIFFS IN NEW ZEALAND...
AND THIS BIG UPDRAFT CAME AND SWEPT ME RIGHT AGAINST THE SIDE, WHAM!
WOW, THAT DOES SOUND LUCKY.
THIS STRAP ALONE SAVED MY LIFE.
GOT HOOKED ON A ROCK AS I WAS FALLING.
REVERSE DARWINISM: SURVIVAL OF THE MOST IDIOTIC.
ALAN, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ME ALONG.
YEAH, WELL, THE BONES WILL STILL BE THERE WHEN WE GET BACK.
THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT BONES: THEY NEVER RUN AWAY.
THE TRUTH IS, YOU GOT ME INTO THIS,
AND I HAVE NO INTENTION OF BEING ON MY OWN WITH THESE PEOPLE.
DON'T GET TOO EXCITED, BILLY.
CHANCES ARE WE WON'T SEE A THING.
YOUR TURN TO BE NICE. WAKE ME WHEN WE GET THERE.
SO, HOW DO YOU KNOW THE KIRBYS?
UH, THROUGH OUR CHURCH.
[ Snarling ] ALAN.

MY GOD, I'D FORGOTTEN.
WE DID IT, HONEY. WE'RE HERE.
[ Udesky ] COOPER, IF YOU SEE ANYTHING, YELL UP.
NO, I THOUGHT I'D KEEP IT TO MYSELF.
I'M SORRY. EVERYONE, IF YOU LOOK OUT THE LEFT OF THE PLANE, YOU CAN SEE A WHOLE HERD OF BRACHIOSAURS.
IN FACT, YOU CAN SEE IN THE FRONT OF THE GROUP, THE ALPHA MALE GRAZING THERE.
UDESKY, NASH, HOW 'BOUT UP FRONT? YOU GUYS SEE ANYTHING?
NOTHING YET, MR. KIRBY.
YOU MEAN-- MRS. KIRBY, LOOK. OUT HERE YOU'LL SEE A GROUP OF TRICERATOPS--
YOU MEAN-- MRS. KIRBY, LOOK. OUT HERE YOU'LL SEE A GROUP OF TRICERATOPS-- MR. KIRBY, WE HAVE A LANDING STRIP UP AHEAD. YOU WANT ME TO PUT HER DOWN?
NO, NO. I TOLD YOU, I WANT TO CIRCLE FIRST, SEE THE WHOLE ISLAND.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SET IT DOWN? YOU CAN'T LAND HERE.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - HOLD ON. I CAN EXPLAIN.

- ARE YOU CRAZY? - [ Paul ] SIT DOWN, PLEASE. [ Thump ] DR. GRANT, WILL YOU PLEASE SIT DOWN?
BILLY, TELL ME WE DIDN'T LAND.
[ Amanda ] ERIC? ERIC? BEN? ERIC? I THINK THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.
BEN? ERIC? I THINK THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

I'M SORRY WE HAD TO BE SO-- WHO HIT ME? WHO HIT ME?
THAT WOULD BE COOPER.
THEY'RE SETTING UP A PERIMETER TO MAKE THE PLACE SAFE. WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
THESE GUYS ARE GOOD. ON THIS ISLAND, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS SAFE.
[ Amanda ] ERIC! WE HAVE TO GET BACK ON THAT PLANE.
WILL YOU TELL YOUR WIFE TO STOP MAKING THAT NOISE? AMANDA! THAT IS A VERY, VERY BAD IDEA.
AMANDA! THAT IS A VERY, VERY BAD IDEA.
BEN? AMANDA? HONEY? WHAT? DR. GRANT SAID THAT'S A BAD IDEA.
WHAT? DR. GRANT SAID THAT'S A BAD IDEA.
WHAT? DR. GRANT SAID THAT'S A BAD IDEA. - HE SAYS IT'S A BAD IDEA! - WHAT'S A BAD IDEA?
- HE SAYS IT'S A BAD IDEA! - WHAT'S A BAD IDEA?
- [ Dinosaur Roaring ] - WHAT WAS THAT?
THAT'S A TYRANNOSAURUS.
[ Gunshots ] I DON'T THINK SO. IT SOUNDS BIGGER.
WE HAVE TO LEAVE! WE HAVE TO LEAVE NOW!
[ Shouting, Indistinct ] [ Paul ] WHAT'S GOING ON?
[ Shouting, Indistinct ] [ Paul ] WHAT'S GOING ON? GET IN THE PLANE!
COOPER'S A PROFESSIONAL. HE CAN HANDLE HIMSELF. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER GUY?
- [ Roaring, Gunshots ] - GET IN THE PLANE! HURRY!
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
PAUL, WE CAN'T-- IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE'LL JUST CIRCLE THE ISLAND.
GIVE ME A HAND, UDESKY.
HEY! STOP!
THAT'S COOPER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- PLEASE STOP. - COOP, GET OUT OF THE WAY.
- [ Sobs ] - YOU KNOW I CAN'T STOP THIS PLANE.
- [ Screams ] - OH, MY GOD!
- [ Udesky ] - WE'RE GOING DOWN! FUEL CUT OFF!
YOU OKAY?
[ Udesky ] WE'RE OKAY UP HERE.
EVERYONE JUST STAY PUT. SAN JUAN APPROACH, MAYDAY!
- WHO HAS THE SATELLITE PHONE? - I DO.
- I GOT IT RIGHT HERE. - I'M NOT GETTING ANYTHING. THE RADIO'S GONE.
WE HAVEN'T LANDED YET.
[ Recording ] ALL CIRCUITS ARE BUSY. DAMN IT! OH, MAN.
WHAT WAS THAT? [ Gasps ]
- [ Screaming ] - KEEP STILL! KEEP STILL! WHAT?
WHAT IS IT? WHAT?
WHAT IS IT? HOLD IT!
HANG ON, EVERYONE!
NO! NO! HELP ME!
MRS. KIRBY, COME BACK!
AMANDA! [ Dinosaur Roaring ]
FOLLOW ME! THIS WAY!
IN HERE!
I THINK WE LOST HIM.
[ Flies Buzzing ] IT'S OKAY, IT'S DEAD.
NOBODY MOVE A MUSCLE.
NO, NO, NO. PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T. STOP, P-PLEASE.
IT'S TIME YOU DID SOME EXPLAINING, MR. KIRBY.
WE CALLED EVERYONE. WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD. NO ONE WOULD HELP US.
THE COSTA RICAN GOVERNMENT SAID THIS IS A NO-FLY ZONE.
THE U.S. EMBASSY-- THAT'S OUR U.S. EMBASSY--
THE U.S. EMBASSY-- THAT'S OUR U.S. EMBASSY-- TOLD US WE SHOULD ACCEPT THE INEVITABLE. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
YOU LET A 12-YEAR-OLD GO PARASAILING ALONE? NO!
- HE WASN'T ALONE. - BEN HILDEBRAND. HE WAS WITH A FRIEND OF MINE.
PAUL AND I DIVORCED OVER A YEAR AGO.
-SO WHY ME? -HE SAID WE NEEDED SOMEONE WHO'D BEEN ON THE ISLAND BEFORE.
YES, BUT I DID NOT TELL YOU TO KIDNAP SOMEBODY.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN ON THIS ISLAND.
SURE YOU HAVE. YOU WROTE THAT BOOK.
THAT WAS ISLA NUBLAR. THIS IS ISLA SORNA, SITE "B."
- YOU MEAN THERE ARE - YOU STAY OUT OF THIS! TWO ISLANDS WITH DINOSAURS?
SO HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN MISSING?
EIGHT WEEKS. ALMOST EIGHT WEEKS NOW.
BILLY. WE GO BACK TO THE PLANE AND SALVAGE WHAT WE CAN, THEN WE MAKE FOR THE COAST.
WE GO BACK TO THE PLANE AND SALVAGE WHAT WE CAN, THEN WE MAKE FOR THE COAST.
DR. GRANT, WE'RE NOT LEAVING THIS ISLAND WITHOUT OUR SON.
THEN YOU CAN GO AND LOOK FOR HIM...
OR YOU CAN STICK WITH US AS LONG AS YOU DON'T HOLD US UP.
EITHER WAY... YOU PROBABLY WON'T GET OFF THIS ISLAND ALIVE.
SO... WHAT DO WE DO?
WE SEARCH FOR YOUR SON... IN THE DIRECTION THAT THEY'RE GOING.
EXCELLENT. EXCELLENT.
OH, SORRY. SORRY.
IT'S NOTHING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE, PAUL.
HOW MUCH WEIGHT DID YOU SAY YOU LOST? ABOUT 25 POUNDS.
HOW MUCH WEIGHT DID YOU SAY YOU LOST? ABOUT 25 POUNDS. I'VE BEEN SWIMMING.
SWIMMING? YOU HATE TO SWIM. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SWIM.
I KNOW. I LEARNED.
YOU LOOK GOOD. SO DO YOU.
WELL, IT'S A SUPERPREDATOR. HOW WOULD YOU CLASSIFY IT, BILLY?
WELL, IT'S A SUPERPREDATOR. HOW WOULD YOU CLASSIFY IT, BILLY? MM-HMM.
SUCHIMIMUS. SNOUT.
NO, THINK BIGGER.
BARYONYX? NOT WITH THAT SAIL.
SPINOSAURUS AEGYPTICUS.
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT ON INGEN'S LIST.
IT WASN'T ON THEIR LIST, AND THAT MAKES ME WONDER WHAT ELSE THEY WERE UP TO.
SO, MR. KIRBY, WHEN YOU CLIMBED K2,
SO, MR. KIRBY, WHEN YOU CLIMBED K2, DID YOU BASE CAMP AT 25 OR 30,000 FEET?
THIRTY THOUSAND FEET. WE WERE CLOSE TO THE TOP.
THIRTY THOUSAND FEET. WE WERE CLOSE TO THE TOP. YOU WERE ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET ABOVE IT, ACTUALLY.
MR. KIRBY. NO, NO, THAT'S A COMMON MISTAKE.
MR. KIRBY. NO, NO, THAT'S A COMMON MISTAKE. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS KIRBY ENTERPRISES, IS THERE?
IT'S KIRBY PAINT AND TILE PLUS.
THE PLUS STANDS FOR BATHROOM FIXTURES.
WE'RE IN THE WESTGATE SHOPPING CENTER, ENID, OKLAHOMA.
SO I DON'T SUPPOSE THAT CHECK YOU WROTE US IS ANY GOOD.
[ Paul ] I WILL PAY YOU, NO MATTER WHAT. THIS IS GOOD. THIS IS GOOD.
HERE WE ARE IN THE WORST PLACE IN THE WORLD, AND WE'RE NOT EVEN BEING PAID.
NOW, WAIT, FELLAS. HOLD ON. I'LL MAKE THIS UP TO YOU.
IF YOU EVER DO A BATHROOM OR A KITCHEN--
YOU'RE NOT REALLY A MERCENARY, ARE YOU?
I NEVER SAID I WAS. THAT'S TRUE.
WELL, I'M LIKE A BOOKING AGENT. WHAT ARE YOU?
ONE OF THE GUYS GOT SICK AND COULDN'T COME.
EXCUSE ME. HERE.
SO YOU RUN A HARDWARE STORE?
HMM. PAINT AND TILE. YEAH.
YOU NEVER CAN TELL ABOUT PEOPLE, CAN YOU? AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH?
QUIET. ERIC?
WOULD YOU STOP THAT? DR. GRANT SAYS THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS TERRITORY.
MAYBE WE SHOULD SPLIT UP OR SOMETHING. WE COULD COVER TWICE AS MUCH GROUND.
"DR. GRANT SAYS--" DR. GRANT SAYS THAT'S A BAD IDEA.
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF HIRING AN EXPERT IF WE'RE NOT GONNA USE HIS ADVICE?
YEAH, EXCEPT DR. GRANT ISN'T LOOKING FOR ERIC. HE'S LOOKING FOR THE COAST.
OKAY, FINE. GO AHEAD AND SCREAM.
THEN WHEN THAT TRICYCLOPLOTS ATTACKS YOU, DON'T COME CRYING TO ME.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. WHAT?
NOTHING. NEVER MIND. WHAT DID YOU SAY? WHAT DID YOU SAY? GOD, PAUL, JUST DROP IT.
WHAT DID YOU SAY? GOD, PAUL, JUST DROP IT.
IF WE SPLIT UP, I'M GOING WITH YOU GUYS.
MRS. KIRBY-- [ Amanda, Paul ] ERIC!
MRS. KIRBY! ERIC!
MRS. KIRBY, THE CHANCES ARE REMOTE THEY'RE STILL IN THE VICINITY.
YOUNG ADULT.
[ Udesky ] HEY, GUYS.
THAT'S MY CAMERA. WAIT.
I GOT AN IDEA. THE BATTERY'S DEAD.
LET ME HAVE THE CAMERA.
[ Eric Over Video Camera ] WHERE WERE YOU ON THAT ONE, MA?
[ Ben Over Video Camera ] OKAY, DIVE, DIVE. OKAY, DIVING.
[ Amanda Over Video Camera ] YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO CATCH IT. COME ON, MA! [ Video Camera Continues ] I SHOT THIS THE MORNING THEY DISAPPEARED.
[ Video Camera Continues ] I SHOT THIS THE MORNING THEY DISAPPEARED.
NO, I WANT THAT. LET ME TAKE THAT. COME ON, GIVE ME THAT.
[ Ben ] NO, NOT YET. [ Eric ] SEE ANYTHING YET?
[ Ben ] NO, NOT YET. [ Eric ] SEE ANYTHING YET? [ Eric ] WHAT WAS THAT?
[ Eric ] WHAT WAS THAT?
[ Ben ] UNCLIP US. THERE'S A BIG CLIP. I CAN'T SEE.
I CAN'T DO IT.
I'M GONNA UNHOOK YOU, ALL RIGHT?
ONE, TWO, THREE.
OKAY, BUDDY? I'M GONNA DROP MYSELF DOWN NOW.
THE CAMERA'S STILL ON. [ Pushes Button ]
HE'S ALIVE. I KNOW HE'S ALIVE.
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.
CAN YOU FLY ONE OF THOSE?
MAYBE, AS LONG AS THE SAIL'S NOT TORN.
WELL, LET'S TAKE IT.
IF WE SPOT A PLANE, IT MIGHT BE A GOOD WAY TO GET ATTENTION.
PULL IT OVER THIS WAY.
I'LL GET IT. I'LL GET IT. OKAY, OKAY.
- GET HER BACK, MR. KIRBY. - AMANDA!
WAIT! [ Screaming ]
AMANDA?
AMANDA. AMANDA. AMANDA, STOP, STOP, STOP.
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY ABOUT BEN.
IT'S NOT BEN, PAUL. IT'S ERIC.
HE'S OUT THERE ALL BY HIMSELF.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
OUR BABY'S OUT HERE ALL BY HIMSELF.
LISTEN TO ME. WE'LL FIND HIM. I PROMISE.
[ Whispers ] PAUL.
[ Paul ] DR. GRANT! YOU SHOULD COME LOOK AT THIS!
[ Quietly ] RAPTOR!
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM. YOU LISTENING TO ME? WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.
THE KID'S GOT RESOURCES. REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO TRY TO GROUND HIM?
WHERE'S BILLY?
I WAS PHOTOGRAPHING THE NEST. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M SORRY. DON'T DO THAT AGAIN.
IF WE LOSE YOU, IT'S JUST ME AND THE DAMN TOURISTS.
[ Paul ] I BET YOU ERIC'S IN THERE. DON'T YOU THINK? I'D BET MY BOTTOM DOLLAR.
DON'T YOU THINK? I'D BET MY BOTTOM DOLLAR.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, IT'S THE FOUR SEASONS.
ERIC!
[ Quietly ] PAUL, DON'T!
WHAT THE HELL?
WHO'S GOT SOME CHANGE? IT ONLY TAKES QUARTERS. I GOT, LIKE-- I GOT A BUCK TEN.
I GOT, LIKE-- I GOT A BUCK TEN.
THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE DINOSAURS?
NO. THIS IS HOW YOU PLAY GOD.
THIS WAY! THIS WAY!
IT'S LOCKED!
THIS WAY! THIS WAY! GO! GO!
HEY! OVER HERE! HEY! OVER HERE!
PUSH! [ Shouting ]
[ Cawing Continues ] MY GOD.
- [ Cawing ] - HE'S CALLING FOR HELP.
[ Cawing Continues ] COME ON!
HEAD TO THE HERD!
HEAD FOR THE TREES!
[ Screaming ] UDESKY.
[ Billy ] MR. KIRBY?
- BILLY? - IS ALAN WITH YOU?
MR. UDESKY? OH, MY GOD.
MR. UDESKY?
HE'S DEAD.
OH, MY GOD, NO, HE'S NOT!
- NO, WAIT! - WE GOTTA HELP HIM. SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.
[ Paul ] AMANDA!
- HOLD ON! - [ Screams ]
THEY SET A TRAP. THEY ACTUALLY SET A TRAP.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
WAIT!
THANKS.
THANKS A LOT, ERIC.
YOU KNOW WHO I AM? YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHO I AM? YEAH. YOUR PARENTS ARE HERE. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR YOU.
TOGETHER?
TOGETHER.
THAT'S NOT GOOD. THEY DON'T DO SO WELL TOGETHER.
YOU'D BE SURPRISED WHAT PEOPLE CAN DO WHEN THEY HAVE TO.
YOU'RE ALAN GRANT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOUR PARENTS, UH,
INVITED ME ALONG.
I READ BOTH OF YOUR BOOKS.
I LIKED THE FIRST ONE MORE. BEFORE YOU WERE ON THE ISLAND.
YOU LIKED DINOSAURS BACK THEN.
BACK THEN THEY HADN'T TRIED TO EAT ME YET.
WHEN INGEN CLEARED OUT, THEY LEFT A LOT OF STUFF BEHIND. ANY WEAPONS?
WHEN INGEN CLEARED OUT, THEY LEFT A LOT OF STUFF BEHIND. ANY WEAPONS? NO. AND I JUST USED THE LAST OF THE GAS GRENADES.
AND I APPRECIATE THAT. [ Coughing ]
BE CAREFUL WITH THAT. T-REX.
IT SCARES THE SMALLER ONES, BUT ATTRACTS ONE REALLY BIG ONE WITH A FIN.
THIS IS T-REX PEE?
HOW'D YOU GET IT?
YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW.
SURE. DESSERT?
ERIC, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I'M ASTONISHED THAT YOU'VE LASTED EIGHT WEEKS ON THIS ISLAND.
IS THAT ALL IT'S BEEN?
YOU'RE ALIVE, AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING.
AND THANKS TO YOU, THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE HAVE IN COMMON.
DID YOU READ MALCOLM'S BOOK?
YEAH.
SO?
I-I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, IT WAS KIND OF PREACHY.
I-I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, IT WAS KIND OF PREACHY. AND TOO MUCH CHAOS. EVERYTHING'S CHAOS.
IT SEEMED LIKE THE GUY WAS KIND OF HIGH ON HIMSELF.
THAT'S TWO THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN COMMON.
LISTEN. [ Chittering ]
COMPYS!
[ Billy ] ALAN!
ALAN!
ALAN!
NO MATTER HOW THIS TURNS OUT, IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
ERIC'S ALWAYS BEEN A STRONG-WILLED KID.
ALWAYS. THEN YOU THROW SOMEONE LIKE BEN HILDEBRAND INTO THE MIX--
WELL--
"WELL" WHAT?
ALL I'M SAYING-- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
NO, IF HE'D BEEN WITH YOU, HE'D BE COMPLETELY SAFE.
YOU DRIVE FIVE MILES UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT, PAUL.
AND I'VE TOTALED THREE CARS IN THREE YEARS.
WELL, NOT THREE. THE BUICK WASN'T REALLY TOTALED.
I JUST SAID IT WAS 'CAUSE I WANTED TO GET THE S.U.V.
I AM SO SORRY THAT YOU HAVE TO BE HERE.
I'M NOT.
[ Alan ] YEAH, THERE'S A BOAT RIGHT ALONGSIDE THE BANK.
LOOKS IN GOOD SHAPE. RESCUE BOAT?
NO, NO. JUST SOMETHING LEFT BEHIND.
NO, NO. JUST SOMETHING LEFT BEHIND. BUT IT FLOATS.
WE STICK TO THE PLAN.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOOK FOR DR. GRANT? HEAD TO THE COAST.
GOING TO THE COAST WAS ALAN'S IDEA. IF HE'S ALIVE, THAT'S WHERE HE'S HEADED.
I AGREE. WHAT ABOUT ERIC?
ERIC'S A SMART KID. HE PROBABLY KNOWS HE STANDS HIS BEST CHANCE BY THE COAST.
HE FIGURES ALL THE BIG DINOSAURS ARE IN THE CENTER OF THE ISLAND. RIGHT?
SURE.
KNOW WHAT THIS IS?
THAT'S A RAPTOR CLAW. USED TO HAVE ONE.
A FOSSIL.
MINE IS NEW.
HOW MUCH OF THE ISLAND DID YOU EXPLORE?
I STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO THE COMPOUND.
I FIGURED IF ANYONE CAME LOOKING FOR ME, THAT'S WHERE THEY'D START.
WE NEED TO GET TO THE COAST. THAT WAS THE PLAN.
ARE YOU SURE? CLOSER YOU GET TO THE WATER, THE BIGGER THINGS GET.
WELL, IF WE CAN FIND OUR WAY DOWN INTO THE CANYON,
WE COULD FOLLOW THE RIVER OUT TO THE COAST.
AFTER WE FIND YOUR PARENTS.
AND THEN WHAT? ONE STEP AT A TIME.
LISTEN.
WHAT?
THAT'S MY DAD'S SATELLITE PHONE! [ Cell Phone Ringing ]
WAIT A MINUTE! HOW DO YOU KNOW?
KIRBY PAINT AND TILE PLUS, IN WESTGATE! DAD!
MOM!
ERIC! ERIC!
ERIC! THIS WAY! ERIC! ERIC!
MOM! DAD!
MOM! ERIC!
MOM! DAD! MOM! DAD!
I KNEW IT! MY GOD! I KNEW IT.
- OH, MY GOD. - AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU.
HEY, YOU GOT MY BAG.
YEAH. LUCKY STRAP.
- WANT ME TO CARRY IT? - WE NEED TO FIND A GAP HERE.
-HOW DID YOU KNOW WE WERE HERE? -THE PHONE. THAT STUPID JINGLE FROM THE STORE, I HEARD IT.
YEAH, YOUR SATELLITE PHONE. WHERE IS IT? MY PHONE?
- I DON'T HAVE IT. - WHEN DID YOU USE IT LAST?
UH, UH, ON THE PLANE.
I GOT A CALL ON THE PLANE, AND-- WHAT?
WHAT! I LOANED IT TO NASH.
HE MUST'VE HAD IT WHEN HE--
RUN.
ALAN, YOU WANNA GIVE ME THE BAG BACK?
THAT'S OKAY, BILLY, I GOT IT.
PLEASE GIVE ME THE BAG.
IT'S NOT SAFE.
RAPTOR EGGS.
DID YOU STEAL RAPTOR EGGS?
NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE. [ Billy ] I SWEAR...
NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE. [ Billy ] I SWEAR... IF I'D KNOWN THAT YOU WERE GONNA END UP WITH THEM--
I TOOK 'EM ON AN IMPULSE. I THOUGHT THEY'D BE WORTH A FORTUNE,
ENOUGH TO FUND THE DIG SITE ANOTHER TEN MORE YEARS.
LOOK, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME. THIS WAS A STUPID DECISION.
BUT I DID IT WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS.
WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS.
SOME OF THE WORST THINGS IMAGINABLE ARE BEING DONE... WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS.
BILLY, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN THE PEOPLE THAT BUILT THIS PLACE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THOSE THINGS ARE AFTER US BECAUSE OF THOSE.
"THOSE THINGS" KNOW WE HAVE THE EGGS.
I DROP THEM IN THE RIVER, THEY'LL STILL BE AFTER US.
WHAT IF THEY CATCH US WITH 'EM?
WHAT IF THEY CATCH US WITHOUT 'EM?
[ Alan ] THERE'S A BOAT AT THE BOTTOM, JUST DOWNRIVER.
[ Alan ] THERE'S A BOAT AT THE BOTTOM, JUST DOWNRIVER. WE CAN TRY AND MAKE IT TO THE COAST, AT LEAST.
YEAH. [ Whistles ] YOU OKAY?
LET'S DO THIS ONE AT A TIME, SHALL WE?
OKAY, COME ON OVER!
ONE AT A TIME!
ALL RIGHT, ERIC, I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU JUST FOR A MINUTE, OKAY?
THEN YOU'RE GONNA BE RIGHT BEHIND ME, OKAY?
MOM, I'VE BEEN ALONE IN A WATER TRUCK FOR EIGHT WEEKS.
I THINK I CAN MANAGE THE NEXT TWO MINUTES WITHOUT YOU.
ALL RIGHT. WE'RE ALL TOGETHER NOW.
OKAY, ERIC!
OKAY. OVER YOU GO. COME ON, HONEY.
MOM?
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT IS IT? IT'S A BIRDCAGE.
FOR WHAT?
- [ Screaming ] - ERIC!
- [ Screaming ] - ERIC! ERIC. ERIC!
ERIC. ERIC!
ERIC. ERIC! HELP ME!
ERIC! ERIC.
ERIC!
I CAN'T SEE HIM! I CAN'T SEE HIM!
ERIC! ERIC!
- [ Babies Screeching ] - NO, NO!
THIS WAY!
BILLY? BILLY?
BILLY, STOP. BILLY, STOP! DON'T, BILLY!
BILLY!
ERIC, HOLD ON!
ERIC!
JUMP!
BILLY!
LET GO NOW!
ERIC? HE'S THERE.
ERIC? ERIC!
THERE HE IS! HE'S ACROSS THE RIVER!
GET HIM OUTTA HERE!
NO, NO. WHAT ABOUT BILLY? GO, ERIC.
- HANG ON, BILLY! - [ Screeching ]
WAIT. BILLY!
[ Gasping ] GET AWAY.
- GET AWAY! - [ Screeching ]
THERE'S PLENTY OF GASOLINE.
NOW WE JUST GOTTA MAKE OUR WAY TO THE COAST.
WORK OUT SOME SORT OF A SIGNAL.
BUILD A FIRE OR SOMETHING. SOMETHING THEY CAN SEE FROM THE AIR.
DR. GRANT?
HEY, ERIC, HOW YOU DOING?
I'M SORRY ABOUT BILLY.
YOU KNOW WHAT THE LAST THING I SAID TO HIM WAS?
I SAID, "YOU'RE AS BAD AS THE PEOPLE THAT BUILT THIS PLACE."
WHICH WASN'T TRUE. BILLY WAS JUST YOUNG.
THAT'S ALL.
I HAVE A THEORY THAT THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF BOYS.
THERE ARE THOSE THAT WANT TO BE ASTRONOMERS,
AND THOSE THAT WANT TO BE ASTRONAUTS.
THE ASTRONOMER, OR THE PALEONTOLOGIST, GETS TO--
GETS TO STUDY THESE AMAZING THINGS FROM A PLACE OF COMPLETE SAFETY.
EXACTLY. BUT THEN YOU NEVER GET TO GO INTO SPACE.
EXACTLY. BUT THEN YOU NEVER GET TO GO INTO SPACE. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IMAGINING AND SEEING:
TO BE ABLE TO TOUCH THEM.
AND THAT'S... THAT'S ALL THAT BILLY WANTED.
DR. GRANT.
KNOW SOMETHING, DR. GRANT?
BILLY WAS RIGHT.
[ Cell Phone Ringing ] LISTEN!
- FIND IT - ERIC, YOU STAY ON THAT BOAT. BEFORE IT STOPS RINGING!
IT'S HERE. WAIT. WHOA-WHOA, IT'S HERE.
HELLO? HELLO!
[ Man ] YOU TOO CAN OWN A TIME-SHARE IN BEAUTIFUL GUADALAJARA.
[ Man ] YOU TOO CAN OWN A TIME-SHARE IN BEAUTIFUL GUADALAJARA. ENJOY A MEAL IN ONE OF OUR FOUR-STAR RESTAURANTS-- LOOK OUT!
TURN UP THE POWER. YOU'VE GOT JUICE FOR MAYBE ONE CALL.
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T CALL THE U.S. EMBASSY. THEY WON'T DO A DAMN THING.
HEY, GUYS! COME HERE! LOOK AT THIS!
SOMETHING MUST HAVE SPOOKED THEM. BONITOS.
GET THE ENGINE GOING, MR. KIRBY.
OPEN THE THROTTLE.
[ Phone Ringing ] PICK UP, PICK UP.
HELLO?
- ELLIE? - HELLO?
HELLO? CHARLIE! CHARLIE!
CHARLIE, TAKE THE PHONE TO MOMMY NOW.
TAKE THE PHONE TO MOMMY. IT'S THE DINOSAUR MAN.
LISTEN TO ME, CHARLIE. OKAY.
CHARLIE, ARE YOU TAKING THE PHONE TO MOM?
CHARLIE!
[ Barney On TV ] OH, HO-HO. HI, EVERYBODY!
IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE! HI, THERE! HOW ARE YOU TODAY?
[ Barney ] THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT!
THE DINOSAUR MAN. WHO'S ON THE PHONE?
HE IS? ALAN?
LOOK IN THE BOXES! FIND A WEAPON!
- [ Ringing ] - WHERE'S THE PHONE? - THERE! - GET THE PHONE!
ELLIE? ELLIE, LISTEN TO ME.
ALAN, ARE YOU ON A CELL PHONE? I CAN'T HEAR YOU?
THE RIVER! SITE "B"! THE RIVER!
HELLO? [ Phone Beeping ]
DAD! DAD!
- [ Screams ] - PAUL!
DAD!
PAUL, YOU JERK!
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME LIKE THIS!
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
REMEMBER WHEN WE WENT FISHING A COUPLE SUMMERS AGO?
I WAS PUTTING THE BOAT IN THE WATER, AND THE TRAILER SANK?
THE TOW TRUCK TRIED TO PULL US OUT, AND IT GOT DRAGGED IN TOO.
THE TRUCK DRIVER WANTED TO KNOCK MY LIGHTS OUT.
I MISS FISHING.
[ Alan ] MR. KIRBY?
HMM? THAT LADY YOU CALLED. WHO IS SHE? HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SHE CAN HELP US?
WHO IS SHE? HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT SHE CAN HELP US?
SHE WAS THE ONE PERSON I COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON. I OWE HER A LOT.
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK I EVER TOLD HER THAT. YOU SHOULD.
[ Rumbling Sound ] SHH. YOU HEAR THAT?
THE OCEAN!
THEY WANT THE EGGS,
OTHERWISE WE'D BE DEAD ALREADY.
EVERYBODY GET DOWN. SHE'S CHALLENGING US.
SHE THINKS YOU STOLE THE EGGS.
- GET BEHIND ME. - [ Hissing ]
GIVE ME THE EGGS.
DO IT, MOM.
NO! NO, NO, NO. CALL FOR HELP.
THAT'S A HELICOPTER.
[ Over Bullhorn ] DR. GRANT? DR. ALAN GRANT?
STOP! THAT'S A VERY BAD IDEA!
WOW. YOU HAVE TO THANK HER NOW. SHE SENT THE NAVY AND THE MARINES!
GOD BLESS YOU, ELLIE.
DR. GRANT, THIS MAN WITH YOU? WHAT?
HEY, YOU MADE IT.
YEAH.
I RESCUED YOUR HAT.
DR. GRANT, WE NEED TO GO NOW.
OH, YEAH.
WELL, THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING.
DR. GRANT!
CAN I GET YOU TO SIT HERE AND BUCKLE UP, SIR?
[ Pilot ] SEA SHADOW DUST STORM ZERO FIVE, SIX SOULS ON BOARD.
[ Control Tower ] DUST STORM SEA SHADOW, ROGER. GOOD WORK.
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
[ Eric ] DR. GRANT, LOOK!
WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING?
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE JUST LOOKING FOR NEW NESTING GROUNDS.
IT'S A WHOLE NEW WORLD FOR THEM.
Once again, I found myself on my own
and going to my mother's annual turkey curry buffet.
Every year she tries to fix me up with some bushy-haired, middle-aged bore
and I feared this year would be no exception.
There you are, dumpling.
My mum, a strange creature
from the time when a gherkin was still the height of sophistication.
-Doilies, Pam? Hello, Bridget. -Third drawer from the top, Una
under the mini gherkins.
By the way, the Darcys are here. They brought Mark with them.
-[Bridget] Ah, here we go. -You remember Mark?
You used to play in his paddling pool. He's a barrister, very well off.
-No, I don't remember. -He's divorced, apparently.
His wife was Japanese. Very cruel race. Now what are you going to put on?
-This. -Oh, don't be silly, Bridget.
You'll never get a boyfriend
if you look like you've wandered out of Auschwitz.
Now run upstairs. Laid out something lovely on your bed.
[Bridget] Great. I was wearing a carpet.
Here she is.
My little Bridget.
-Hi, Uncle Geoffrey. -Got a drink?
-No. -No?
-Come on, then. -Actually, not my uncle.
Someone who insists I call him "uncle" while he gropes my arse
and asks me the question dreaded by all singletons.
-So, how's your love life? -Super. Thanks, Uncle G.
Still no fellow, then? I know them.
You career girls can't put it off forever, you know.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
-Hello, Dad. -Hello, darling.
-How's it going? -Torture.
Your mother's trying to fix you up with some divorcee.
Human rights barrister. Pretty nasty beast, apparently.
[Bridget] Who? Ding-dong.
Maybe this time Mum had got it right.
Come on. Why don't we see if Mark fancies a gherkin?
Good luck.
Mark.
Maybe this was the mysterious Mr. Right
I'd been waiting my whole life to meet.
You remember Bridget.
Maybe not.
She used to run around your lawn with no clothes on, remember?
Uh, no, not as such.
Come and look at your gravy, Pam. I think it's going to need sieving.
Of course it doesn't need sieving. Just stir it, Una.
Yes, of course. I'll be right there. Sorry. Lumpy gravy calls.
-So. [chuckles] -So.
Are you staying at your parents' for New Year?
-Yes. You? -Oh, no, no, no, no.
I was in London at a party last night, so I'm afraid I'm a bit hung over.
Wish I could be lying with my head in a toilet like all normal people.
New Year's resolution, drink less, oh, and quit smoking.
Oh. [laughs] And keep New Year's resolutions.
And stop talking total nonsense to strangers.
In fact, stop talking full stop.
Yes, well, perhaps it's time to eat.
Apparently, she lives just round the corner from you.
Mother, I do not need a blind date.
Particularly not with some verbally incontinent spinster
who smokes like a chimney, drinks like a fish, and dresses like her mother.
Yummy. Turkey curry, my favorite.
And that was it. Right there.
Right there. That was the moment.
I suddenly realized that unless something changed soon
I was going to live a life where my major relationship
was with a bottle of wine,
and I'd finally die fat and alone
and be found three weeks later half-eaten by Alsatians.
Or I was about to turn into Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction.

[Bridget] And so I made a major decision.
I had to make sure that next year I wouldn't end up shit-faced
and listening to sad FM, easy listening for the over-30s.
I decided to take control of my life and start a diary
to tell the truth about Bridget Jones, the whole truth.
Resolution number one, obviously, will lose 20 pounds.
Number two, always put last night's pants in the laundry basket.
Equally important, will find nice, sensible boyfriend to go out with
and not continue to form romantic attachments to any of the following,
alcoholics, workaholics, commitment phobics
peeping Toms, megalomaniacs, emotional fuckwits, or perverts.
And especially will not fantasize about a particular person
who embodies all these things.
Unfortunately, he just happens to be my boss,
editor-in-chief, Daniel Cleaver, and for various slightly unfair reasons
relating to this year's Christmas party, I suspect he does not fantasize about me.
[singing off-key] ♪ I can't live ♪
♪ If living is without you ♪
♪ I can't live ♪
♪ Can't give anymore ♪
[Bridget] Or maybe I'm wrong.
-Happy New Year, Mr. Fitzherbert. -Happy New Year, Brenda.
Mr. Fitzherbert. "Titspervert," more like.
Daniel's boss, who stares freely at my breasts
with no idea who I am or what I do.
Morning. I need that Kafka's Motorbike release by 11:00.
Perpetua.
Slightly senior, and therefore thinks she's in charge of me.
Most of the time, I just want to staple things to her head.
-Publicity. -All I asked,
I only asked if he wanted to come on a mini-break to Paris.
Daily call from Jude. Best friend.
Head of investment at Brightlings Bank, who spends most of her time
trapped in the ladies' toilet crying over her fuckwit boyfriend.
Am I too needy? Am I co-dependent?
No, you're not. It's not you. You're lovely. It's vile Richard.
[scoffs] He's just a big knob head with no knob.
Is some people's opinion of Kafka,
but they couldn't be more wrong.
This book is a searing vision of the wounds our century has inflicted
on traditional masculinity.
It's positively Vonnegutesque.
Thank you for calling, Professor Leavis.
-Guest list for launch party. -Ah.
F.R. Leavis?
Wow.
The F.R. Leavis who wrote Mass Civilization and Minority Culture?
The F.R. Leavis who died in 1978?
Amazing.
[Bridget] Emergency summit with urban family for coherent discussion of career crisis.
Fuck them. Fuck the lot of them.
Tell them they can stick fucking Leavis up their fucking arses.
Good, good. That's very useful. Very useful.
Shazza, journalist. Likes to say "fuck" a lot.
Jude, what would you do if one of your assistants
made a harmless little mistake like that?
-I'd fire you, Bridge. -Excellent.
Is that Cleaver chap still as cute as ever?
Oh, God, yes.
Then I think a well-timed blowjob is probably the best answer.
-Oh, you love it. -Are you that chap that sang that song?
Yes. Yes, I am.
[Bridget] Tom, '80s pop icon who only wrote one hit record
then retired because he found that one record was quite enough
to get him laid for the whole of the '90s.
-Well, great song. -Thank you. Thank you so much.
-Total poof, of course. -More vodka?
No! Yes! Fill her up, goddamn it! Fill her up.
At least now I'm in my 30s, I can hold my drink.
-Mind the step. -She's fine. Drive on.
Apparently F.R. Leavis is coming.
Afternoon, Bridget.
What do you mean you're going on holiday?
What about Julia?
Yes.
Very difficult.
Well, he went to the meeting.
[Perpetua] Well, we could always get the bio. Yeah.
We've got a problem with the Teddy Knows Best campaign.
The only problem is the kitchen.
Quite frankly, there isn't room to swing a...
[Bridget] Message Mr. Cleaver.
Am appalled by message.
Skirt is demonstrably neither sick nor absent.
Appalled by management's blatantly size-ist attitude to skirt.
Suggest management sick, not skirt!
Right. Yeah.
No, I understand that. I understand that perfectly.
[Bridget] Very bad start to the year.
Have been seduced by informality of messaging medium
into flirting with office scoundrel.
Will persevere with resolution to find a nice, sensible man.
Will put a stop to flirting. First thing tomorrow.
Good plan.
[Daniel] If walking past office was attempt to demonstrate presence of skirt
can only say that it has failed parlously. Cleave.
[Bridget] Shut up, please. I am very busy and important.
PS. How dare you sexually harass me in this impertinent manner?
[Daniel] Message Jones. Mortified to have caused offense.
Will avoid all non-PC overtones in future. Deeply apologetic.
PS. Like your tits in that top.
[Bridget] Mustn't read too much into it, though.
And it all began, of course, with some very irresponsible e-mailing
over Bridget's nonexistent skirt.
Daniel.
-The New York office for you. -Yeah. Tell them I'll get back to them.
Daniel.
Jones.
-Evening, Kenneth. -Good evening, Daniel.
If you've got a moment, I'd like a word before you leave tonight.
Yes, certainly. Yeah.
-I'll see you in a sec. -Excellent.
-And Brenda? -Yes.
At the Kafka's Motorbike thing, thought it might be fun
if you introduce me before I introduce him.
Add a lovely sense of occasion.
Certainly, sir.
Psst. Brenda.
-What are you doing tonight? -Um, actually, I'm busy.
Right. Well, that's a shame. I just...
I thought it might be a charitable thing to take your skirt out for dinner
and try and fatten it up a bit.
-[chuckles] -Maybe you could come too.
-What about tomorrow? -No.
-Tomorrow's the launch. -Yes, of course.
Possibly the worst book ever published.
Well, in the end, that's not the ad line we've gone for.
-Then, next night. -Let's see, shall we?
'Night, Daniel.
Right. No pressure, Bridge, but your whole future happiness
now depends on how you behave on this one social occasion.
-Right. What shall I do? -First, look gorgeous.
God!
Two, then totally ignore Daniel and suck up to famous authors.
Salman. Salman. Salman.
Circulate,
oozing intelligence.
Isn't it terrible about Chechnya? Isn't it terrible about Chechnya?
Chechnya.
Introduce people with thoughtful details, such as,
Sheila, this is Daniel. Daniel, this is Sheila.
Sheila enjoys horse riding and comes from New Zealand.
Daniel enjoys publishing and comes--
-All over your face? -[Tom] Exactly.
-[laughs] -Excuse me. I'm terribly sorry to interrupt you when you're having dinner.
I'm terribly sorry to interrupt you when you're having dinner.
-It's just that-- -Yes. Yes, it was me.
Yes. Nine years ago. No current plans to record anything else.
-Thank you so much. -Oh. It's just that
your... Your chair is on my wife's coat.
-Your... Your chair, only... -Of course it is.
-I'm so terribly sorry. -Thank you so much. Thank you.
[Bridget] Hmm. Major dilemma.
If I actually do, by some terrible chance, end up in flagrante,
surely these would be most attractive at crucial moment.
However, chances of reaching crucial moment greatly increase
by wearing these, scary stomach-holding-in pants
very popular with grannies the world over.
Huh. Tricky. Very tricky.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the launch
of Kafka's Motorbike, "The Greatest Book Of Our Time."
And here to introduce it is Mr. Titspervert.
Oh! Fitzherbert. Fitzherbert. Fitzherbert.
Okay, circulate, oozing intelligence.
Ignore Daniel and be fabulous with everyone else.
I am the intellectual equal of everyone else here.
It's like a whole theory of short fiction and of the novella, you know.
And of course, the problem with Martin's definition of the novella
is that it really only applies to him.
That doesn't sound like Martin. Not.
I mean, I could be wrong. What do you think?
Do you know...
Where the toilets are?
Stay calm. Can't get any worse.
What are you doing here?
I've been asking myself the same question.
I came with a colleague. So how are you?
Well, apart from being very disappointed
not to see my favorite reindeer jumper again, I'm well.
Anyone going to introduce me?
[Bridget] Ah. Introduce people with thoughtful details.
Perpetua, this is Mark Darcy.
Mark's a prematurely middle-aged prick with a cruel-raced ex-wife.
Perpetua's a fat-ass old bag who spends her time bossing me around.
Maybe not.
Anyone going to introduce me?
Ah, Perpetua. [chuckles]
This is Mark Darcy.
Mark's a top barrister. He comes from Grafton Underwood.
Perpetua is one of my work colleagues.
Hi, Mark. I know you by reputation, of course.
Ah, Natasha.
This is Bridget Jones. Bridget, this is Natasha.
Natasha is a top attorney and specializes in family law.
Bridget works in publishing, and used to play naked in my paddling pool.
-How odd. -[chuckles nervously]
-Perpetua, how's the house hunt going? -Disaster.
Can't even go into it with you.
-By the by, that man is gorgeous. -Ah, yes, Mark.
Just give me time. Give me time.
[Daniel] You've written "a searing vision," but can you remember the rest of this?
"Of the wounds our century has inflicted on traditional masculinity.
Positively Vonnegutesque." Obviously.
Listen, you don't know where the loos are here, do you?
-Yes. They're that way. -Thanks.
One, two.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Hello.
Ladies and...
Sorry, the, uh, mike's not working.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the launch of Kafka's Motorbike
"The Greatest Book Of Our Time."
Obviously, except for your books, Mr. Rushdie,
which are also very good.
And Lord Archer.
Yours aren't bad either.
[clears throat] Anyway, what I mean is...
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for coming to the launch of one of the top 30 books of our time.
Anyway. At least.
And here to introduce it properly [chuckles nervously]
is the man we all call...
[Bridget] Titspervert.
Mister...
Titspervert.
Mister...
Titspervert.
Fitzherbert.
Uh... Because that is his name.
Mr. Fitzherbert.
Thank you.
[Fitzherbert] Thank you, Brenda.
Just switch this on.
So how autobiographical is your work, Salman?
You know, it's an amazing thing. Nobody's ever asked me that question.
Excuse me.
Jones, sod them all. It was a brilliant
postmodernist masterpiece. Oratorical fireworks, really.
You're looking very sexy, Jones.
I think I'm gonna have to take you out to dinner now
whether you like it or not, okay?
Come on. Get your stuff.
So how do you feel about this whole situation in Chechnya?
-Isn't it a nightmare? -I couldn't give a fuck, Jones.
Now look. How do you know Arsey Darcy?
Apparently I used to, um, run around naked in his paddling pool.
I bet you did, you dirty bitch.
-What about you? -Same, yeah.
No, no, I was best man at his wedding.
Um, knew him from Cambridge. -He was a mate. -And then what?
And then, uh, nothing.
You don't need to protect him. He's no friend of mine.
Well, um, then, many years later,
I made the somewhat catastrophic mistake
of introducing him to my fiancée.
And...
I couldn't say in all honesty I've ever quite forgiven him.
God. So...
He's a nasty bastard as well as a dull bastard.
Yes. Yes, I think that's fair.
Anyway, fuck him. Listen, don't let him ruin our evening.
Why don't you have some more wine
and tell me more about practicing French kissing
with the other girls at school?
-That's a very good story. -It wasn't French kissing.
Don't care. Make it up. It's an order, Jones.
[Daniel] So, how about a drink at my place?
Totally innocent, no funny business, just full sex.
No. I should get a taxi.
But thank you for the lovely dinner.
It's a pleasure, Jones.
Now, these are very silly little boots, Jones.
And this is a very silly little dress,
and these are,
fuck me, absolutely enormous pants.
-Jesus. Fuck. -No. Don't apologize. I like them.
-Hello, Mummy! -[chuckles]
I'm sorry. I have to have another look.
-They're too good to be true. -No!
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
I'm wearing something quite similar myself. Here. I'll show you.
No. [laughs]
-That was fantastic. -Oh.
-[Bridget] Daniel. -Yeah?
What happens at the office?
Oh. Well, I'm glad you asked that. You see,
it's a publishing house, so that means people write things for us
and then we print out all the pages and fasten them together
and make them into what we call a "book," Jones.
No, do you think people will notice?
-Notice what? -Us.
-Working together, sleeping together. -Hang on... Hang on a minute, Jones.
Just slow down. It started on Tuesday, and now it's Thursday.
It's not exactly a long-term relationship yet, is it?
You are a very bad man.
Bridget Jones, wanton sex goddess, with a very bad man between her thighs.
Mum. Hi.
It's a truth universally acknowledged
that the moment one area of your life starts going okay,
another part of it falls spectacularly to pieces.
[woman] Anyone else want to have it oeuf? Don't be shy, madam.
French.
Have it oeuf with the WiseCrack Egg Peeler.
Now, nice, firm grip.
Put it in the hole.
Up, down, up, down, and off it comes in your hand.
Oh! Mind the overspray. Sorry.
Darling, if I came in with my knickers on my head, he wouldn't notice.
I've spent 35 years cleaning his house
washing his clothes, bringing up his children.
I'm your child, too.
To be honest, darling, having children isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Given my chance again, I'm not sure I'd have any.
Now it's the winter of my life,
and I haven't actually got anything of my own.
I've got no power, no... No real career,
no... No sex life.
Got no life at all. I'm like the grasshopper who sang all summer.
-Like Germaine sodding Geer. -Greer.
Well, anyway, I'm not having it. And I've been talent-spotted.
Julian thinks I've got great potential.
-Who's Julian? -The man on the Shopping Channel.
Comes into the store to have his colors done.
Potential for what?
As a demonstrator on his cable show. You know, his assistant.
Apparently, it's the highest-rated show on the channel.
Well, apart from the one, you know, with the fat people who beat up their relatives.
Ooh! I must whiz. Have you heard from Mark Darcy?
Goodbye, Mum.
Julian.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
[Bridget] And a few weeks later, it got lots worse.
-Hello! -Look at this.
[Julian] [on TV] ...hanging off this heart-shaped pendant.
One of my own personal recommendations
is this absolutely stunning matching necklace and earring set.
The earrings, measuring just over a centimeter
in genuine diamante with topaz and lapis lazuli
in a lovely mock-gold finish.
The exact replica of those worn at Wimbledon in 1993
by Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Kent.
Well...
Has she actually moved out, then?
Apparently she and this tangerine-tinted buffoon
are suddenly an item.
Half our friends have had them around to bloody dinner.
She's even taking Jaundiced Julian to Una Alconbury's tarts and vicars party.
That's not the Pamela I knew. That's cruel.
Still, um, could be a golden opportunity
if you spent the entire party
flirting with other women, it would drive Mum wild with jealousy.
-Will it? -That's how I got my man.
Have you got a boyfriend? A real one?
I have, Father. I have. And he's perfect.
[Bridget] Hurrah. I am no longer tragic spinster
but proper girlfriend of bona fide sex god,
so committed that he's taking me
on a full-blown, mini-break holiday weekend.
[Daniel] Just promise me we don't have to sit in any little boats
and read ponce poetry to each other.
He's also agreed to protect me
at Uncle Geoffrey's hideous tarts and vicars fancy dress party.
This can't be just shagging. A mini-break means true love.
Suddenly feel like screen goddess in manner of Grace Kelly.
Though, perhaps, ever so slightly less elegant under pressure.
Very quiet here, isn't it? Are we the only guests or...
We have a wedding this weekend.
I believe there are just four of you not involved.
[Natasha] You do the boats. I'll do the tea.
-Oh, Jesus. -Hello there.
Hi.
Well, well.
Take it you're also heading for the Alconburys' rockery.
-Yes, that's right. -I brought Natasha.
Get a bit of work done. Thought I might make it a not-entirely-wasted weekend.
How interesting. What a gripping life you do lead.
Well, I'll see you upstairs in a second.
Well, the weakness of their case
lies in the deposition they made on August 30.
"Season of mist and mellow fruitlessness"
Oh, fuck me, I love Keats. Have you heard this one?
"There was a young woman from Ealing Who had a peculiar feeling
She lay on her back And opened her crack
And pissed all over the ceiling"
-Bollocks. Shit. -What are you doing?
I'm boarding you. -I can't see an alternative. -Don't you dare!
-I can't see an alternative. -Don't you dare!
-I'm king of the world! -No!
Oh, fuck me!
-[Daniel] Piss and bollocks. That's it. -You stupid arse!
Bollocks.
-All right. -Fuck, no!
So childish.
Yes.
[Daniel] Darce, come on in! Water's lovely.
Come on, you're working too hard, mate.
-Daniel. -Yes, Bridget.
That thing you just did is actually illegal in several countries.
That is, of course, the major reason I'm so thrilled
That is, of course, the major reason I'm so thrilled -to be living in Britain today. -[laughs]
Yes, I can't understand why the Prime Minister
doesn't mention it more in his speeches.
-You should write to him about it. -I intend to.
-Daniel. -Bridget.
-Do you love me? -Shut up, or I'll do it again.
-Do you love me? -Right. You asked for it.
-And over you go. -[laughs]
[Daniel] I'm going to give you something to bite on.
Here. Okay? Pop this in your mouth, darling.
You're begging for it.
Stop it!
I've got to go back to town. A meeting's come up.
-On a Sunday? -No, the meeting's first thing tomorrow.
I've got to work on some figures.
We could just pop into the party
for a minute and leave really, really early.
Bridge, I'm really sorry. I just can't do it. I can't...
I've got to head back.
Listen, Daniel, if you've changed your mind, you could just say so.
Because, honestly, I don't see what could be so important.
No, well, you wouldn't, would you?
'Cause you don't have the faintest bloody idea
of how much trouble the company's in.
You swan in, in your short skirt and your sexy see-through blouse
and fanny around with press releases.
You know, this is the Americans flying in 'cause they're thinking of shutting us down
for fuck's sake!
Sorry.
I'm sorry, Bridge, I'm being a prat.
I'm going to arrange a lovely car to come and pick you up
and take you back to London after the party, okay?
If you have to travel alone, travel in style.
And, um, I also think it's very important
that you win this costume competition.
Good. Good start.
Now then, Miss Jones, where does this go?
[Bridget] Oh, well, here we go.
Trying hard to fight off a vision of Mum and Auntie Una in fishnet tights.
Seems unnatural, wrong even, for 60-year-olds
to dress up as prostitutes and priests on a Sunday afternoon.
Oh, holy Jesus.
Bridget.
-Where are all the other tarts and vicars? -Oh, dear. Didn't Geoffrey call you?
Geoffrey, didn't you telephone Colin and Bridget?
How's my little Bridget?
-Geoffrey. -So, where's this chap of yours then, hey?
-Yes, well, he had to work, so... -Ha! Likely tale.
Off they run. Wee!
Bizarre what some men find attractive.
-Oh, God. -[Pam] Darling.
Geoffrey!
What on earth are you wearing? You look like a common prostitute.
-Yes, that was actually the point. -Say hi to Julian.
Hello, Julian.
My dear, you and your mother could be sisters.
And what a lovely bracelet. It's what I call an "all-rounder."
Sort of thing one can wear with anything to any occasion.
-Have... Have you spoken to my dad? -Yes. He's behaving most bizarrely.
I think he was actually trying to flirt with Penny Husbands-Bosworth, poor thing.
She was very frightened. She's only just had her ovaries done.
-I don't know what you ever saw in him. -Shh. Bad man.
Didn't tell you either?
I didn't spend as much as Bernard, thank God.
-I'm sorry, Dad. -The way she looked at me.
Well, she loves you, really.
You love each other. This is only a temporary glitch.
Is it? I don't know.
I don't know.
Ah, Bridget. There you are. Don't worry. You're not the only one.
This is Penny.
Geoffrey didn't get in touch with her either.
I'm sorry?
I was just saying, Geoffrey didn't contact you either
to tell you that the tarts and vicars concept had gone out the window.
-Oh, yes, he did. -Oh, right.
Lovely dress. Very exotic.
What a shame you couldn't bring your boyfriend, Bridget. What's his name?
-David? Darren? -Daniel Cleaver.
-Oh! Is he a friend of yours, Mark? -Absolutely not.
I hope he's good enough for our little Bridget.
I think I can say with total confidence, absolutely not.
Well, I'm sure he'd say the same about you, given your past behavior.
-Sorry? -I think you know what I mean.
Mark.
[Bridget] Hmm. Looks like Auntie Shirley didn't get the message either.
Hi.
I just really, really wanted to see a friendly face.
Now, listen. I tell you what. I have an idea.
Let me finish this, while you go home have a... Have a long hot bath
and I'll call 'round, and we'll have dinner later, okay?
-Is there someone here? -Not that I'm aware of.
Unless that Bosnian family's moved in again. Bastards.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm going mad. [chuckles]
Listen, I'm feeling really bad, actually. I should have been there, today.
No, I'm sorry.
No, no, I'm sorry. At least I got a hell of a lot of work done, as you can see.
-Yes. -Just give me one more hour, okay?
Fine. That's fine. I'll go home and de-bunny.
And you know last night when I said that I loved you?
I didn't mean it. I was being ironic.
Oh, God. Yeah, I know, I know.
All right.
Thank you, madam.
Bridge.
Bridget.
This is Lara from the New York office.
-Lara, this is Bridget. -Hey, there.
I thought you said she was thin.
[woman] [on TV] I was hoping that you would want to be a part of it.
[man] Listen, this is totally insane.
I'm 36 years old. It may be my last chance to have a child.
Alex.
[narrator] [on TV] The male penetrates the female and leaves.
Coitus is brief and perfunctory.
For the female, all there is to do now is wait and wait.
We've had very good response to the Teddy Knows Best teaser campaign
and had various local radio bids
-for author interviews, which is good-- -Look, Bridge, stop that. I feel terrible.
The thing is with Lara and me...
-Well, you know... -No, you'll have to fill me in.
Well, the truth is we're the same, Bridge, you and me.
You know, we're two people of a certain age
looking for the moment to commit and finding it really hard.
And I just think that in the end it's got to be something extraordinary,
something which makes us go that extra mile,
and I think Lara, I don't know,
being American and all. Something to do with confidence
and being so...
Well, young, you know.
We've become very close.
Well, you've only just met her. She flew in yesterday.
Silly Bridget.
-You haven't only just met her. -No.
No, I got to know her pretty well
when we were in the New York office together.
Fuck.
There's no easy way to say this...
But I want you to be the first to know that...
We're engaged.
[Bridget] At times like this, continuing with one's life seems impossible,
and eating the entire contents of one's fridge seems inevitable.
I have two choices.
To give up and accept permanent state of spinsterhood
and eventual eating by Alsatians,
or not, and this time I choose not.
I will not be defeated by a bad man and an American stick insect.
Instead, I choose vodka.
And Chaka Khan.
Why do you want to be in television?
Well, I've realized that I've become deeply committed
to communicating to the public the up-to-the-moment and in-depth news,
both political and ecological.
What do you think of the El Niño phenomenon?
Um, it's a blip.
I think basically Latin music is on its way out.
So why do you want to work in television?
Because I'm passionately committed to communicating with children.
-They are the future. -Do you have any children of your own?
-They are the future. -Do you have any children of your own? [groans in disgust] Christ, no.
[groans in disgust] Christ, no.
Sorry.
[man] So, why do you want to work in television?
I've got to leave my current job because I've shagged my boss.
Fair enough. Start on Monday. We'll see how we go.
And, incidentally at Sit Up Britain
no one ever gets sacked for shagging the boss.
That's a matter of principle.
Bridge, come on.
I know it's been awkward as arse, but there's no need to leave.
No, actually there is. I've been offered a job in television.
-Television? -Mmm.
And they want me to start straightaway.
So I've got to leave in about... Ooh, three minutes.
So...
Would you just... Just hold it right there, Miss Jones?
I'm sorry to inform you, but I think you will find that by contract
you are expected to give at least six weeks' notice. Ah, yes, well, I thought with the company being
Ah, yes, well, I thought with the company being
in so much trouble and all,
you wouldn't really miss the person who
"waltzes in, in a see-through top and fannies about with the press releases."
-Bridget. -I want to hear this.
Because if she gives one inch,
I am going to fire her bony little bottom anyway for being totally spineless.
What?
I just think you should know that, um,
there are lots of prospects here for a talented--
-Daniel. -Just give me a minute, would you, Simon?
-Thanks. -Right, boss man.
Lots of prospects for a person who, uh,
you know, perhaps for personal reasons has been
slightly overlooked professionally.
Thank you, Daniel. That is very good to know.
But if staying here means working within 10 yards of you,
frankly, I'd rather have a job wiping Saddam Hussein's arse.
Well, bye, everyone.
Oh, just sod off.
[man] [on TV] Hello and welcome to Sit Up Britain, a current affairs show...
Okay, everybody, it is bonfire night and we are on fire.
We have live fire station feeds from Newcastle,
Swansea, Sheffield, and Lewisham just poised for tragedy.
Bridget Jones, where are you?
I'm here, Richard.
Put on some more make-up. I want you on camera.
I'm thinking miniskirt, I'm thinking fireman's helmet.
I want you pointing a hose, I want you sliding down the pole
and then go straight to the interview.
Great. I'll do it.
No problem. Fine. Right.
So, you drop into the shot, and then interview Chief Fireman Bevan.
Yep. Yep. Yep. Go, go. Go, go. Go!
-Go? -Oh, no.
We're going to fire-fighters in Newcastle first.
Stop! Climb back up! Climb back up!
-On you in 30 seconds. -Okay.
Neville, what the fuck is going on?
She's supposed to be sliding down the pole, not climbing up it.
-Go, go. Go, go. Go! -Oh! Okay!
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Okay, we're out of time. Just wind her up.
Well, that seems to be about all we've got time for down here in Lewisham.
Chief Officer Bevan, thank you very much.
Excellent fire station.
And now back to the studio.
[Bridget] Excellent. Am national laughingstock.
Have bottom the size of Brazil
am daughter of broken home, am rubbish at everything, and...
Oh, God, am having dinner with Magda and Jeremy.
The only thing worse than a smug, married couple,
lots of smug, married couples.
Right, everyone, this is Bridget.
Bridge, this is Hugo and Jane. And obviously you know Cosmo and Woney.
-Hi, Bridge. -Hi, Bridge.
-This is Alastair and Henrietta. -Hello.
-Julia and Michael. -[both] Hey.
-Joanne and Paul. -[both] Hello.
And Jeremy's partners from chambers, this is Natasha Glenville and Mark Darcy.
-Hi, there. -Hello.
-Not in your bunny-girl outfit today? -No.
We bunnies only wear our tails on very special occasions.
-Right, B. Sit yourself down. -Right.
Hey, Bridge, how's your love life? Oh. [chuckles]
Still going out with that publishing chappie?
Uh, no, no, actually.
-Never dip your nib in the office ink. -[chuckles]
Right. [chuckles]
You really ought to hurry up and get sprogged up, old girl.
Time's a running out. Tick-tock.
Yes. Yes.
Tell me, is it one in four marriages that ends in divorce now or one in three?
One in three.
Seriously, that office is full of single girls in their 30s.
Fine physical specimens, but they just can't seem to hold down a chap.
Yes, why is it there are so many unmarried women in their 30s these days, Bridget?
Oh, I don't know.
I suppose it doesn't help that underneath our clothes,
our entire bodies are covered in scales.
I very much enjoyed your Lewisham fire report, by the way.
Thank you.
Yeah, well.
It didn't work out with Daniel Cleaver?
No, it didn't.
I'm delighted to hear it.
Look, are you and Cosmo in this together?
I mean, you seem to go out of your way to try to make me feel
like a complete idiot every time I see you,
and you really needn't bother.
I already feel like an idiot most of the time anyway,
with or without a fireman's pole.
That will be my taxi. Goodnight.
Look, um, I'm sorry if I've been...
What?
I don't think you're an idiot at all.
I mean, there are elements of the ridiculous about you.
Your mother's pretty interesting.
And you really are an appallingly bad public speaker.
And you tend to let whatever is in your head
come out of your mouth without much consideration of the consequences.
I realize that when I met you at the turkey curry buffet
that I was unforgivably rude and wearing a reindeer jumper
that my mother had given me the day before.
But the thing is...
What I'm trying to say, very inarticulately is
that, in fact, perhaps, despite appearances,
I like you very much.
Apart from the smoking, and the drinking, and the vulgar mother,
-and the verbal diarrhea. -No, I like you very much just as you are.
Mark, we really are making progress on the case in here.
Jeremy's had a most brilliant idea.
Right. Right.
I must go, because...
Bye.
"Just as you are"? Not thinner? Not cleverer?
Not with slightly bigger breasts and a slightly smaller nose?
Well, fuck me.
But this is someone you hate, right?
Yes, yes, I hate him.
[Bridget] November 9. Weight: 138 pounds.
Cigarettes: Three. Birthday: 33.
Okay, Bridget. See if you can get it right this time.
The verdict in the Aghani-Heaney case is expected today.
Get yourself down to the high court. I want a hardheaded interview.
-You do know the Aghani-Heaney case? -Yes, of course.
Big case
featuring someone called "Aghani-Heaney."
Or two people called Kafir Aghani and Eleanor Heaney?
That's the one. [chuckles]
She's a British aid worker. He's a Kurdish freedom fighter.
The government want to extradite him home where he will certainly be executed.
She's married to him, and they've fought for five years to keep him here.
-Today is the decision. -That's exciting.
Yes, it is. So what are you waiting for?
[Bridget] Am suddenly hardheaded journalist
ruthlessly committed to promoting justice and liberty.
Nothing can distract me from my dedication to the pursuit of truth.
Well, almost nothing.
Right. I'll just pop to the shop quickly for some ciggies.
14p for the Polos and a packet of Wheat Crunchies.
-[Mark] A packet of Embassy, please. -I'm sorry. I'm not quite.
Good afternoon.
Hi.
You like me just the way I am.
-Sorry? -Nothing.
Bridget, we fucked up utterly.
Eleanor Heaney and Kafir Aghani have come and gone.
Oh, God. I'll be sacked.
-Did the others get interviews? -I don't know. I was having a slash.
-Actually, nobody got interviews. -So how do you know?
Because I was defending him and I told him not to give any interviews.
Look, I have a plan.
And action.
Mr. Darcy, you were defending Mr. Aghani. You must be delighted.
Yes, Kafir Aghani has spent his entire life
defending the basic human rights of his own people,
and today's verdict has been the result of five years of struggle by this woman
Eleanor Heaney to save the man she loves from
an extradition order that would've been tantamount to a death sentence.
Right.
And, Eleanor, over to you.
Did you fancy Kafir the first time that you saw him?
This has been Bridget Jones for Sit Up Britain
with, let's face it, a bit of a crush now, actually.
Good afternoon.
Bridget Jones. Already a legend.
[Bridget] Oh, joy, I am broadcasting genius
celebrating by cooking birthday feast for close friends.
Have sneaking suspicion am also something of genius in the kitchen as well.
"Tie flavor-enhancing leek and celery together with string."
Right. String.
Perfect.
"Finely slice oranges and grate zest."
Oh, bugger. Oh, bugger, bugger!
Where the fuck is the fucking tuna?
[sighs] This is Bridget Jones for Sit Up Britain, searching for tuna.
Bridget Jones.
-Hello, darling. -Hi, Mum.
I just wanted a bit of a chat.
Ouch! Careful, you ham-fisted cow!
The thing is, darling, between you and me,
I'm not entirely sure that Julian isn't a bit of a shit.
You know, Mum, I haven't really got time right now.
Okay.
I can't deny the sex is still very surprising.
Do you know, the other night, quite unexpectedly,
I was just dozing off and I felt this huge...
Bye, Mum.
What time do you call this?
The door was open.
I, uh... I came to congratulate the new face of British current affairs.
But I see I may have come at a bad time.
How's it look?
Uh, great. It's, um, blue.
-Blue? -No, but blue is good.
If you ask me, there isn't enough blue food.
Oh, shit! It must have been the string.
-No, it's string soup. -[chuckles]
Oh, God. They're going to be here any minute.
Don't worry. I'm sure they've come to see you and not
orange parfait in sugar cages.
-Let's have a drink. -Yes.
-Happy birthday. -Thank you. [chuckles]
Did I really run round your lawn naked?
Oh, yes. You were four and I was eight.
That's a pretty big age difference.
-It's quite pervy, really. -Yes, I like to think so.
What are we going to do about this dinner then?
We can have blue soup to start, orange pudding to end,
and for the main course, you have congealed green gunge.
That is caper berry gravy, actually.
-Do you have eggs? -Yes.
Right. Omelet, it is then. With caper berry gravy.
You wouldn't by any chance have any beetroot cubes, would you?
Mini gherkin? Stuffed olive?
No, Pam.
And besides, I'm busy. The gravy needs sieving.
Surely not. Just stir it, Una.
Happy birthday!
-TV queen! -We're so proud!
Bridge, you looked so fucking thin! You looked fantastic!
-Hello. -Hello.
-Are you joining us? -Yeah. Of course.
Excellent.
Delicious. Really special.
It's really... It's really very good.
[Shazza] Really, it's very nice.
So...
Mark, why did your wife leave you?
Mmm! Eat up. Eat up. Two more lovely courses to go.
Mmm. Delicious.
I have to say, this is the most incredible shit.
-This is the worst of the three. -It does actually remind me of something.
-It tastes like-- -Marmalade.
[Tom] Well done, Bridge.
Four hours of careful cooking and a feast of blue soup, omelet, and marmalade.
-Thank you. -I think that deserves a toast, don't you?
To Bridget, who cannot cook
but who we love, just as she is.
-To Bridget, just as she is. -To Bridget, just as she is.
I'll go.
Who?
Ah... Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
I'm obviously interrupting.
Darcy. What brings you here?
Oh, right, yeah. I should have guessed, shouldn't I?
Hi, I'm Tom. It's really good to meet you at last.
Yeah, listen, I just came to...
I thought you might be on your own.
What an idiot.
Excuse me.
I've been going crazy.
I can't stop thinking about you
and thinking what a fucking idiot I've been.
Christ, is that blue soup?
Yes.
You know that Sunday in the country.
Come on outside.
It was all just going so fast.
The hotel and that weekend, meeting your parents, I just panicked.
You know me.
I'm... I'm a terrible disaster with a posh voice and a bad character.
You're the only one who can save me, Bridge. I need you.
Without you, 20 years from now, I'll be in some seedy bar with some seedy blonde.
And what about Lara?
Oh. Over. Over. Totally fucking finito.
Dumped me.
Dumped me when she realized I hadn't got over you.
I know you're thinking it's just a sex thing,
but I promise you, whenever I see that
skimpy little skirt on TV,
I just close my eyes and listen to all the intelligent things you'll say.
I was thrilled that little Kurdish bloke was set free.
Bridge, I've missed you a lot.
I'm going now. Bye.
-Mark, stay. -No, I don't think I will.
Listen, don't leave on my behalf.
I think it's about time you and I put this past behind us, don't you, Darcy?
At least stay for a birthday drink with me and Bridge, huh?
Goodbye, Bridget.
Mark.
-Why are you here? -Bridge,
I just told you why I'm here.
And why was Mark wanker Darcy here? Oh, bloody hell. Wait a minute, he's back.
-All right, Cleaver. Outside. -[scoffs] I'm sorry?
Outside?
Uh, should I bring my dueling pistols or my sword?
All right. Hang on.
I should have done this years ago.
-Done what? -This.
Fuck!
Fuck me, that hurt!
-What the fuck do you think you're doing? -This.
Oh, Christ, not again.
-Fight! -[man] What?
-Where? -Well, quick. It's a real fight!
[Daniel] All right. All right. All right. I give up. I give up.
Just give me a moment, all right?
Just let me get a moment's break here, okay?
[all] [chanting] Cheat!
I'll shin you!
-Whose side are we on? -Mark's, obviously.
He's never dumped Bridget for some naked American.
And he said he liked her just the way she is.
Yes, but he also nicked Daniel's fiancée and left him brokenhearted.
Good point. It's a very hard one to call.
-[Bridget] No, no, no, no, no, no, no. -[Tom] Oh, yes!
-I'm so sorry. -[groans]
-[man] What are you doing? -Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I really am sorry. I... I will pay.
-Had enough, Darcy? -Not quite, if that's all right by you.
[Daniel] You broke my bloody jaw!
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
[all] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday, dear what's-his-name ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
Jesus.
All right. All right. Enough.
Enough, wanker.
[Bridget] What is your problem?
-My problem? -Yes!
You give the impression of being all moral and noble
and normal and helpful in the kitchen,
but you're just as bad as the rest of them.
Well, I can see that I've been laboring under a misapprehension.
Very, very foolish mistake.
Forgive me.
Let's go back upstairs.
Come on.
We belong together, Jones.
Me, you,
poor little skirt.
Right.
If I can't make it with you...
I can't make it with anyone.
That's not a good enough offer for me.
I'm not willing to gamble my whole life on someone who's, well, not quite sure.
It's like you said, "I'm still looking for something
more extraordinary than that."
[Bridget] December 25.
Weight, 140 pounds, plus 42 mince pies.
Alcohol units, oh, thousands.
Bugger off!
Come on then, kids.
This Baroque carriage clock is a particular festive favorite of mine
incorporating the Hallelujah Chorus from Handel's Messiah
every hour, on the hour.
I can't understand it. The man's actually turned red now.
Merry Christmas, Pamela.
Well, I'm going to Bedfordshire.
-Night-night. -Night-night.
The thing is...
Well, close up, he was almost purple.
You're such a lovely normal color.
He had a filthy temper.
And, well, the jewelry is fabulous, and really very reasonably priced.
I thought I might ask if...
We could have another go.
I mean, obviously with some effort on your part
to pay a bit more attention to me.
I do realize what I'm like sometimes.
It doesn't help that you and Bridget have your lovely grown-up club of two
and are always saying, "What's silly old Mummy gone and done this time?"
You used to be mad about me.
You couldn't get enough of me.
What do you think?
I don't know, Pam.
I just don't know now.
It's been very hard.
Oh, Colin. [sniffles]
I'm joking, you daft cow.
Pam, I just don't work without you.
Awful.
Lovely. Lovely. Lovely.
Get back up those stairs, young lady. Get dressed.
What for?
The Darcy's ruby wedding party. "What for" indeed.
Mark will be there. Still divorced.
He's also still deranged. I'm not going.
Poor Mark. This is always a bad time of year for him.
You know, his Japanese wife left him on Christmas Day. Cruel race.
Yes, but I'm not quite sure he didn't deserve it, actually.
She ran off with his best friend from Cambridge.
Total scoundrel, apparently. Best man at his wedding.
Then Christmas Eve, Mark comes home early from work
finds the pair of them in a most unorthodox position
stark naked, at it like rabbits.
Just give me five minutes.
Stop! Stop the car! Stop the car!
-Dad, get out. Too slow! -Why?
-Dad, get in! Hurry! -What's the hurry?
Not too fast.
Bit snowy, isn't it?
Sorry. One moment.
Thank you for inviting me.
I didn't. It must have been my parents.
-So. -So.
Hello, Bridget. Didn't know you were coming.
Mark, your father wants to begin ASAP.
Oh, does he? Right.
Come on, Mark. Be helpful, please.
The caterers have totally screwed up. Does nothing work outside of London, hmm?
Apparently not. [chuckles]
Well, I have to...
Listen. Uh...
I owe you an apology about Daniel.
He said that you ran off with his fiancée and left him brokenhearted, he said.
No, it was the other way around. It was my wife.
My heart.
Sorry.
That's why you always acted so strangely around him
and beat him to a pulp, quite rightly.
Well done.
Can... Can we just, um,
pop out there for a moment?
Okay.
I just have something that I want to say.
you once said that you liked me just as I am
and I just wanted to say, likewise.
I mean, you wear stupid things your mum buys you. Tonight's another classic.
You're haughty, and you always say the wrong thing in every situation.
I seriously believe that you should
rethink the length of your sideburns.
But, you're a nice man...
And I like you.
If you wanted to pop by sometime, that might be nice.
More than nice.
Right.
Crikey.
[Malcolm] Ladies and gentlemen, could I have your attention for a moment, please?
Excuse me.
Of course.
...wife and companion, Geraldine.
A toast to her, my wonderful wife, Geraldine.
[all] To Geraldine.
And we, in turn, have been blessed with our son, Mark.
He's always made us proud
and we couldn't be prouder of him than on this particular day
because I'm thrilled to announce, he has just been invited
to be a senior partner in the firm of Abbott & Abbott in New York.
He also, incidentally takes with him, his brilliant partner in law, Natasha.
And I don't think they will mind, since we're amongst friends
if I say that, someday, this remarkably clever girl
is going to be something else in law as well!
I begged him not to say anything. [chuckles]
So I ask you now to charge your glasses once again
to Mark and his Natasha.
-[all] To Mark and his Natasha! -No! No!
It's just that
it's such a terrible pity...
For England
to lose such a great legal brain...
-Is she pissed? -What?
...for the people of England,
like me and you, to lose one of our top people.
Our top person, really.
Well, I better dash.
I've got another party to get to.
Loads of single people.
Mainly poofs.
Bye.
-Yes? -[all] Hi! It's us!
Great. Come on up.
Have we got the most fantastic surprise for you!
-No, you're not going to sing again? -Not that fantastic, sadly, no.
Still, pretty good. We decided to take you to Paris for the weekend
so you can forget about everything, particularly forget about Mark Darcy.
I can't believe you said what you said you said.
I know!
There goes my invite to the Darcys' next year.
If he didn't leap over the family heirlooms
and whip you up in his arms, then sod him.
Yes. He's clearly the most dreadful cold fish.
Exactly. I mean, there's been all these bloody hints and stuff,
but has he ever actually stuck his fucking tongue down your fucking throat?
No. Not once.
-Well, I think we should pack. -Passport, Bridget, and pants.
Yep. Pants.
Hurry up, Bridge. We're freezing our bollocks off out here.
Yeah. Just the keys.
I'm stuck up!
Come the fuck on, Bridget.
-[Jude] Close the door. -Bridget.
What are you doing here?
I just wanted to know if you were available
for bar mitzvahs and christenings as well as ruby weddings.
Excellent speech.
I thought that you were in America.
Well, yes, I was,
but I realized I'd forgotten something back home.
Which was?
Well, I realized I'd forgotten to, um...
Kiss you goodbye. Do you mind?
Not really, no.
So, you're not going to America, then?
No. Not.
-You're staying here? -So it would seem.
-Friends of yours? -[laughs]
No, I've never seen them before in my life.
Look, are you coming to fucking Paris or not?
Not.
-No fucking room anyway. -No.
Maybe we should just go upstairs for a minute.
-Yes, very good idea. -[Tom] No room for him either.
Close it down. Tell him we're sorry.
Uh... Give me just a minute.
Keep yourself busy. Read something. Lots of very high-quality magazines
with helpful fashion and romance tips.
I'll be right with you.
Definitely an occasion for genuinely tiny knickers.
Right.
Right.
Mark. Mark.
Mark! Mark!
Oh, shit!
Double shit.
Bollocks!
Oh, God.
-Wish me luck! -Good luck, crazy girl!
Mark!
Mark!
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean it. I mean, I meant it.
But I was so stupid that I didn't mean what I meant.
Oh, for Christ's sakes.
It's only a diary.
Everyone knows diaries are just full of crap.
I know that.
I was just buying you a new one. Time to make a new start, perhaps.
Wait a minute.
Nice boys don't kiss like that.
Oh, yes, they fucking do.
I'm delighted. You know, they're both really good friends of mine
and I think it's great that they've found each other at last.
Yeah. Brilliant. This is Pauline, by the way.
-Paula. -Paula. Paula. Paula.
Sorry. [chuckles]
How marvelous! Marvelous! [chuckles]
Nice, healthy, well-built girl.
Can't be doing with a girl who's just skin and bone.
I like a woman with a backside you can park your bike in and rest a pint on.
Malcolm.
Well, obviously, I'm disappointed.
Bitterly disappointed.
But, you know, Just because someone's got a boyfriend
doesn't necessarily mean they won't...
You know.
No, no, no. There's absolutely no bitterness, no hard feelings.
I just think it's great that in the same month that Bridge found Darce,
Ramon, hey! How's it goin'? How you doin'?
right there on the desk. There it is, Where's she headed?
Where's she headed? She's snowbound, Ramon.
with the pink. See you went Yeah, yeah.
a pink day today. It's kind of I'm gonna have another pickup for you on Thursday.
We'll see you then. All right. All right. Thanks, Ramon.

It could either destroy us or keep us warm. That's why every FedEx office has a clock. Because we live or we die by the clock.
We never turn our back on it. And we never, ever allow ourselves
the sin of losing track of time! Locally, it's 1:56.
three hours and four minutes That means we've got
before the end-of-the-day's package sort.
That's how much time we have... That's how long we have. ( translating )
before this pulsating, accursed, relentless taskmaster
tries to put us out of business.
Hey. Nicolai, good to see you. Hey, Nicolai.

What could it possibly be? Is it architectural plans? Maybe technical drawings?
Maybe technical drawings? for the-- for the bathroom? Is this the new wallpaper
( translator continues ) It is...a clock, which I started at absolute zero
22 minutes and 17 seconds. and is now at 87 hours,
to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours. From Memphis, America
is a shameful outrage. Eighty-seven hours
This is just an egg timer!
This is just an egg timer! What if it had been something else? ( translating ) Like your paycheck?
( translating ) Like your paycheck? Or fresh boysenberries? Or adoption papers?
Eighty-seven hours is an eternity. The cosmos was created in less time!
The cosmos was created in less time! nations toppled in 87 hours! Wars have been fought and

YEAH. WHO IS THAT?
IT'S JUST A WRONG NUMBER.
[ Bilkins ] YES, SIR. YEAH, I KNOW, BUT--
UH, YEAH. YEAH. YES. YES, SIR.
YEAH. I GOT IT.
THE DVD PLAYERS WERE PURCHASED LEGALLY.
ALL WE'VE GOT ON TRAN AND COMPANY ARE A COUPLE OF LOW-RENT WEAPONS CHARGES... AND SOME OUTSTANDING SPEEDING TICKETS.
AND SOME OUTSTANDING SPEEDING TICKETS.
SO, THEY'RE OUT. YEAH.
FATHER BAILED 'EM OUT.
IS THIS THE KIND OF INTELLIGENCE I CAN EXPECT FROM YOU, O'CONNER?
- YOU'RE GONNA PUT THIS ON ME? - I CAN PUT IT ON WHOEVER I WANT TO, KID.
- PERKS OF THE JOB. - NO, THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA PUT THIS ON ME--
NO, WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. LET ME TELL YOU.
I DON'T CARE IF YOU HAVE TO PUT A GUN TO SOMEONE'S HEAD...
AND BLOW YOUR COVER TO SMITHEREENS.
AND BLOW YOUR COVER TO SMITHEREENS. YOU'VE GOT 36 HOURS TO CRACK THIS BASTARD,
OR YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER CAREER.
IT'S TORETTO, BRIAN. IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN TORETTO.
TRAN AND HECTOR ARE--
THEY'RE JUST FUMES.
WELL, I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO ME. MY QUESTION IS THIS.
HAVE YOU BEEN LYING TO YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE PAST MIA?
HE WON'T GO BACK TO PRISON.
WELL, THAT'S A CHOICE HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE.
THERE'S ALL KINDS OF FAMILY, BRIAN.
AND THAT'S A CHOICE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE.

BRIAN, DON'T LOSE THAT COOL OF YOURS.
THAT'S YOUR MEAL TICKET.
MY MEAL TICKET? WHAT? I-- I CAN'T PAY FOR MY OWN SHRIMP?
I GOT THE SHRIMP.
NO, SEE, THAT'S ONE THING ABOUT ME, DOM, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I DON'T NEED HANDOUTS. I DON'T TAKE HANDOUTS. I EARN MY WAY, EVERY STEP.
JUST GOTTA MAKE A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA ON THE SIDE, LIKE YOU.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, LIKE ME?
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, "LIKE ME?"
DON'T TRY-- I'M NOT STUPID, ALL RIGHT?
I KNOW THAT THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL YOU PAID FOR ALL THAT SHIT YOU GOT UNDER THE HOOD--
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL YOU PAID FOR ALL THAT SHIT UNDER THE HOOD OF THOSE CARS...
BY DOING TUNE-UPS AND SELLING GROCERIES.
WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE IN ON, I WANT IN ON IT TOO.
WELL, WHAT IS THIS? READ IT.

WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN YOUR HAND? THROWING DOWN THE PINK SLIP, JUST LIKE YOU.
THE PINK SLIP TO WHAT? THE JETTA? YEAH.
YOU CAN'T BET YOUR DAD'S CAR. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I AIN'T LOSING.
IT'S ALL RIGHT. I AIN'T LOSING.
THIS FOOL IS RUNNING A HONDA TWO THOUSAND. I'LL WIN.
THAT WAY ME AND MY DAD CAN ROLL TOGETHER WHEN HE GETS OUT OF PRISON. IT'S ALL GOOD.
WELL, THEY'RE GONNA THROW HIM RIGHT BACK IN PRISON AFTER HE KILLS YOU.
YOU VISUALIZE THE WIN.
HEY, VISUALIZE THE WIN, JESSE. I'M SERIOUS. YOU GOT TO LISTEN TO ME, MAN.
HEY, VISUALIZE THE WIN, JESSE. I'M SERIOUS. YOU GOT TO LISTEN TO ME, MAN. WHO ARE YOU RACING?
WHO ARE YOU RACING?
JESSE, DON'T DO IT.

OH, GOD!
YO! HEADS UP, BRO. WE GOT PROBLEMS.

OKAY, WATCH IT. TORETTO!
SWAT CAME INTO MY HOUSE,
DISRESPECTED MY WHOLE FAMILY BECAUSE SOMEBODY NARC'D ME OUT.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WAS YOU!
NO! GET OFF OF HIM, MAN. GET OFF OF HIM!
DOM, CHILL OUT, MAN. COME ON! I NEVER NARC'D ON NOBODY!
I NEVER NARC'D ON NOBODY!

MIA, I'M DOING THIS FOR BOTH OF US. NO, DON'T GIVE ME THAT CRAP. YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR YOU.
YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR YOU.
WHY ARE YOU INSISTING ON DOING THIS? DOM, PLEASE, JUST DON'T.
MIA, WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. NO, I DON'T, BRIAN.
OH, SO WHAT? YOU ALWAYS HAVE TEARS IN YOUR EYES WHEN DOM DRIVES AWAY?
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?
COME ON. WHAT'S YOUR BROTHER RACING OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT FOR?
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TRUCKS. YOU KNOW ABOUT THE TRUCKS? NO, BRIAN! WHAT TRUCKS?
JESUS CHRIST. WHAT? LISTEN TO ME.
MIA, I'M A COP.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, BRIAN? WHAT IS THIS?
EVER SINCE THE FIRST TIME I MET YOU, I'VE BEEN UNDERCOVER.
I'M A COP.
OH, YOU BASTARD.
YOU BASTARD.
MIA. GET OFF OF ME, BRIAN!
MIA! LISTEN TO ME!
EVERYTHING I EVER SAID I FELT ABOUT YOU WAS REAL.
I SWEAR TO GOD. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME, MIA.
BUT RIGHT NOW THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU AND ME. YOUR BROTHER'S OUT THERE.
BUT RIGHT NOW THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU AND ME. YOUR BROTHER'S OUT THERE. HE'S ABOUT TO PULL A JOB, AND WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
HE'S ABOUT TO PULL A JOB, AND WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
HE'S ABOUT TO PULL A JOB, AND WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. THOSE TRUCKERS, THEY'RE NOT LAYING DOWN ANYMORE.
THOSE TRUCKERS, THEY'RE NOT LAYING DOWN ANYMORE. MAYBE THEY'LL MAKE IT THROUGH TONIGHT,
MAYBE THEY'LL MAKE IT THROUGH TONIGHT, BUT EVERY SINGLE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA'S COMING DOWN ON 'EM.
IF YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN TO YOUR BROTHER, TO LETTY, TO LEON, TO VINCE...
YOU HAVE TO JUST GET IN THAT CAR WITH ME RIGHT NOW. YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.
MIA, YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON THAT CAN HELP ME RIGHT NOW.
PLEASE, MIA. PLEASE HELP ME.
CIVICS ARE STASHED SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE OF THERMAL.

YOUR SISTER'S RIGHT ABOUT THIS ONE. THIS DON'T FEEL GOOD.
- DON'T DO THAT. - SOMETHING'S WRONG.
STOP. WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS WITHOUT JESSE.
LOOK, THIS IS THE MOTHER LODE. WE'VE BEEN ON THIS FOR THREE MONTHS.
AFTER THIS, IT'S A LONG VACATION FOR EVERYONE.
LET'S GO. I HOPE SO.
LISTEN, THE OTHER NIGHT I HAD A DREAM... THAT YOU AND I WERE ON THE BEACH IN MEXICO.
THAT YOU AND I WERE ON THE BEACH IN MEXICO.
REALLY? REALLY.

IF WE DON'T GET HIM TO AN AMBULANCE IN TEN MINUTES, HE'S DEAD.
HOLD THIS. HOLD THE PRESSURE. I GOT IT.
- JUST LIKE THAT. DON'T LET GO. HOLD HIS ARM UP. - VINCE.

SIX FOOT, MAYBE 200 POUNDS.
HE'S GOT A REAL DEEP LACERATION TO HIS RIGHT ARM, WITH ARTERIAL BLEEDING. AND HE'S GOT A-- A SHOTGUN WOUND.
AND HE'S GOT A-- A SHOTGUN WOUND. CLOSE RANGE TO HIS LEFT FLANK. YEAH.
CLOSE RANGE TO HIS LEFT FLANK. YEAH. YEAH, AND HE'S GOING INTO SHOCK!
DOM, PUT THE GUN DOWN NOW!
- MOVE YOUR CAR. - NO. BULLSHIT!
PUT IT DOWN NOW! NO MORE RUNNING!
I'M NOT RUNNING!
- WHERE'S LEON AND LETTY? - THEY'RE LONG GONE!
THEN IT'S OVER. I DIDN'T CALL THE POLICE. BUT DON'T PUSH ME!
- PUT THE GUN DOWN! I SWEAR TO GOD! - YOU ARE THE COP!
YOU'RE A COP!
BRIAN! I GOT TO FIND JESSE BEFORE THEY DO.
I'M ALL THE KID'S GOT. I'LL CALL IN THE PLATES.
P.D. WILL PICK HIM UP WAY BEFORE JOHNNY EVEN GETS NEAR HIM.

DOMINIC, I AM SO SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, DOM.
I'M SO SCARED RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
JESS! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, MAN?
I DON'T KNOW! I PANICKED! I'M SORRY.
I'M SCARED! [ Motorcycles Approaching ]
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING! WILL YOU PLEASE HELP ME?
DOM!
JESSE!
[ Sobbing ] NO, JESSE!
NO, DOM, NO!
CALL 911. YOU. CALL 911!
I USED TO DRAG HERE BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.
THAT RAILROAD CROSSING UP THERE IS EXACTLY A QUARTER MILE AWAY FROM HERE.
ON GREEN, I'M GOING FOR IT.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
I OWE YOU A TEN-SECOND CAR.
[ Dominic ] I LIVE MY LIFE A QUARTER MILE AT A TIME.
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.
Meryl Streep she wasn't.
Who's Meryl Streep?
Zoe, she's like Katie Holmes to our parents.
So, what's next, ladies?
-I have to go home. -No.
I can't have another fight with my parents. They think I'm in bed.
Were you kids in bed early?
-I stayed up till 10. -After 9, Rhett was asleep.
-Who's driving them? -I will.
Nicki's selling coffee at school. I promised I'd help her.
It sucks.
Do not say "sucks," say "disappoints."
I don't need a lunch. I'll go with Tash.
Eat pizza three days in a row? I think not.
That's really good.
The proportions are perfect...
...but do you draw what you really see?
The simplest is the hardest. Seeing what's in front of you.
What's on for tonight? I am so grounded. I got busted sneaking back inside last night.
I am so grounded. I got busted sneaking back inside last night.
-Damn, how'd you manage that? -My dad set the motion detector.
Our parents are getting paranoid in their old age.
Mine still trust me.
It's beautiful.
Not a bad couple of decades. Better than the first two without you.
Better than the first two without you.
To 20 years of you and me.
And to our children, safe at home.
Hey, cool, you lost them!
Macho Mustang boys, to boot!
-We struck a blow for sisterhood! -The only "blow" you know.
Diss.
-Any raves? -Full Moon Underground.
San Bernardino. Probably Saturday.
I'll tell Mom I'm staying with you.
I can't believe you still work that scam.
What can I say? My 'rents are clueless.
I'll bring glowsticks if you buy gas.
-That's such a good idea! -Nice try, Beams.
Rest, it'll be one hell of a weekend.
-Bye, Tasha. -Don't let the bedbugs bite!
Now they call the cops on me.
Hello!
Hello!
I'm sorry I'm late.
Ruby Baker?
Yeah, I'm Ruby.
Whatever they said, I'm not missing. I just went out.
Your parents were in a car accident.
Are they okay?
-Ruby, why don't you have a seat, hon? -Are they okay?
My partner will help you have a seat. Ruby.
-I can sit down myself. -I know.
Are they okay?
-Relax. -We're here to help you.
You'll be okay.
Relax. Ruby?
You'll be okay.
-Get her pulse. -Can you hear me, Ruby?
"They are as asleep.
In the morning, they're like grass which groweth up.
In the morning, it flourisheth and groweth up.
In the evening, it is cut down and withereth...
...for we're consumed by thine anger and by thy wrath we're troubled.
Thou has set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins...
...in the light of thy countenance.
For all our days are passed away in thy wrath.
We spend our years as a tale that is told...
...so teach us to number our days...
...that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom."
I think Rhett Baker wants to say something. Rhett?
I just--
I just wanna say....
I just....
It's okay.
I didn't work with Dave and Grace or see them every day...
...but I knew them for 10 years...
...and I'm sure if they could hear this....
Well, Grace...
...would do her dismissive little giggle.
You know the one.
And Dave would mutter an "expletive deleted."
They'd hate to be remembered as anything but... ...ordinary.
Which is exactly what they were:
Anything but ordinary.
But they will live on...
...through their children and in all our hearts.
Ruby?
Do you remember me?
I'm Uncle Jack, your mom's brother.
I'll go wait by the car, okay?
If there's anything that you need...
...anything I can do...
...I don't mean in the next few weeks or months, I mean anytime....
How come I haven't seen you in, like, 10 years?
Have you even met my brother Rhett?
Well, of course I have.
I haven't seen either of you in years.
First of all, I live pretty far away. Chicago.
Then how will you help us?
I don't know. There's the phone, e-mail.
-You and my mom never wrote. -That's true.
As siblings get older, they go separate ways.
-You Rhett are close now-- -We're not.
We have nothing in common.
Used to feel that way about your mom. It's not true.
I used to think I'd take a month off and come out here...
...and get to know you, your brother and Grace again.
Nice to see you. Sorry things didn't work out.
-I'll call you later, okay? -Okay.
Ruby? Hi.
-I'm Alvin Begleiter. -Hi.
I'm so sorry.
I'm your-- I was your parents' estate lawyer.
I planned their wills...
...what they wanted to do with their money and--
The most important issue right now is who'll take care of you.
You and Rhett.
I'm assuming you know the Glasses?
I've known them my whole life.
Good. I know that your parents...
...chose them after a great deal of consideration.
And there's something else.
Your parents were extremely thrifty...
...and with your mom's share, your dad's life insurance...
...there's enough for you and Rhett for the rest of your lives.
Obviously you don't know Rhett.
That's good. I'll give you one of my cards.
I don't expect trouble.
But if you have any concerns any problems....
I'm an estate lawyer and also a trust lawyer.
I want to be someone you can trust.
-You call me, okay? -Okay.
Mr. Glass.
-Ruby. -Thank you.
My mom and dad would've loved that speech.
-They would've loved it. -Come here.
That's good. We're gonna get through this.
We'll get through it together, okay?
Oh, Ruby.
You're in good hands.
Hey!
-You guys ready for Malibu? -It'll be a change, we won't lie.
It's not the worst place. -Is this your car? -My company's, on loan for today.
-Is this your car? -My company's, on loan for today.
Sweet!
This place is huge!
Hey, Rubes, check out this view.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
-Cool, a meteorite! -It's art, Rhett.
Give them the tour. Stall them, I order dinner.
Let's get the lay of the land.
Master suite.
Home gym.
-Home theater. -Sweet.
-You never have to leave home. -If only.
Vicki comes in most days.
-Hola, niños. -Hola.
Hello!
This is your room.
It's temporary quarters, of course.
Unpack, get settled, and I'll meet you in the kitchen.
We're sharing a room?
Glance at me when I'm changing and you're busted.
We have a little calamari, a little risotto with mushrooms...
...and green salad with some Swiss chard.
-Do you have any Garfield? -What is that?
-It's crap in a can. -If it's crap, how come you eat it?
-Come on, kids. Try the calamari. -Isn't that squid?
-Honey, tonight.... -I'll call Domino's.
Thank you.
Can you turn and face the wall?
Who are you, the Blair Witch?
I'm worse. Just face the wall.
Turn that stupid thing off!
There's public school, then there's public school.
Trust me, there won't be any Bloods or Crips.
I'm not scared of getting gunned down.
-You're a great kid-- -It's not about being great.
-It's about being.... -New?
Middle-of-the-year new.
There's a saying we teach the Pain Ward patients.
"This too shall pass."
This too shall pass. This too shall pass.
Hi.
Why don't you take a seat in the back?
We have a new addition.
Would you introduce yourself, Miss Baker?
You just did.
Hi.
I'm Ruby Baker.
I used to go to Shady Lane. That's in the Valley.
Not my choice, just an accident of birth.
How come you moved here?
It was another accident.
Let's make Ruby feel welcome.
Thanks for the lift.
Sweet!
I can't believe it!
Like one of those isn't noisy enough?
No, Rubes. You can't play "Pokémon Snap" on PlayStation.
You can play "Ape Escape," but not on N-64.
Mom and Dad would freak out.
Don't talk about them.
I haven't seen one girl with blue-black hair.
The guys surf and swim all day. That sun-worshiping culture.
That sounds hot.
I checked my pager all day. I figured you'd call and you didn't.
Cell phones are banned at school. The kids don't care.
They can't see they lost their liberties.
They have so much sunstroke, they're wasted.
Ruby?
I got us an assortment of different things.
Some cold pastas, some salads.
Ruby, I think that you'd be well-served by a better attitude.
It's okay. I don't mind take-out. You're busy. It's not from Wendy's.
It's not from Wendy's.
I meant your attitude toward your new school.
-My attitude? -I overheard your conversation.
You were listening in?
No, I was trying to get a line out, but that's beside the point.
The point is, you need those kids to like you.
Otherwise, you'll isolate, sabotage yourself.
-You'll have a miserable time. -Okay, I get it.
I learned something.
Ruby?
Ruby.
-Wake up. -I'm awake.
-Wake up. -Mommy?
Mommy?
You scared the crap out of me.
I heard noises. I thought it was a burglar or coyote.
I'm not used to kids here.
Come here.
Thank you.
You must be freezing.
No more 3 a.m. swims. With all the glass, you hear everything.
I'll set the alarm at night.
Are you coming?
Drunk driving among teens has...
...steadily decreased, but we can do better.
As these images starkly attest...
...alcohol remains the No. 1 problem among teens.
This year, 20 percent of teenage drivers....
How was your first day of Driver's Ed?
-Fine, I guess. -They still show gruesome movies?
Those were the Dark Ages.
They have better ways of teaching kids today.
May I be excused?
Stupid, kid-proof piece of crap.
Ruby?
Was it awful? I mean, the driving class?
-I can just imagine. -No, it's....
I have my period.
Come with me.
Thank you.
Four doctors recommend....
This cramp, too, shall pass.
I'll turn it off when I get to a save point.
It's cool. I don't care.
It's kind of relaxing.
Erin, get out of there!
What were you doing in there? Tell me the truth!
-What are you implying? -Tell me!
No, I won't answer you! Good night!
-What the hell are you doing? -Getting ready for bed.
-Watch your language. -Don't play games with me.
-Watch your language. -Don't play games with me. You know what I'm talking about.
You know what I'm talking about.
I'm too tired to guess. I'm sick of your accusations.
Is that what you call it now?
-How many-- -I've done every--
You told me you--
Ruby?
-Hi, I'm Hannah. -Hi.
There's this rumor you were on academic probation.
Cut to the chase, huh?
I was. I had sex with the dean and he took it off my record.
Oh, not really.
I was supposed to be at my friend Tasha's...
...doing an essay, and went to this rave.
Sunday I was fried and downloaded this thing off the net.
-Tuesday, I was busted. -Hey, Hannah!
-Hey! I gotta go. -Bye.
Hey, Ruby.
My company's driving people to a premiere.
I gotta make sure everything run smooth. Wanna come?
I have homework, three more hours. Pretty heavy, so....
That's perfect.
Can we catch the end of the movie or go to the party?
Actually, the hell with Westwood.
-My drivers can handle a premiere. -Evening, sir.
Mud pie for the lady. Ketel One, rocks, for me.
Great.
Thank you.
That party'd be a mob scene. I really want to talk to you.
-Here you are. -Thank you.
I remember when you guys moved down the block 11 years ago.
It was funny. I noticed the furniture as they brought it in.
Erin noticed a little girl.
But you were upset. I guess about moving cross-country.
You wouldn't say a word.
Just hugged this plastic doll against your chest.
Malibu Barbie, I think it was. Prophetic, huh?
Think you mean "pathetic."
No, no.
-I guess you moved on years ago. -From what?
From hugging plastic dolls.
I should hope so.
Last night, when you fought...
...it wasn't about us, right?
No. Married people sometimes like to...
...push each other's buttons.
It's a form of intimacy, a lower form, nothing serious.
One thing I haven't said about Erin:
It can be lonely living with her.
But that's my cross to bear, not yours.
I think it's past my bedtime, Terry.
Of course it is.
Let's get you to bed.
Terry.
You're not wearing your shoulder belt.
Hey.
Try not to make too much noise. Rhett and Erin are asleep.
Okay?
Hamlet senses something's wrong...
Hamlet senses something's wrong... ...that he alone can set right.
I want two pages next Friday...
...about what he means and whether he succeeds.
Mr. Begleiter, before my parents--
They ever speak about guardians for Rhett and me?
Different from the Glasses? No.
-I think they wanted to. -They discussed it with you?
No, but my parents weren't friendly with them after they moved.
Ruby, the Glasses aren't your parents.
They'll never be your parents.
-If Erin or Terry has done anything-- -We sleep in one room.
That's not ideal.
The other night we were alone in Terry's car. He--
What? What did he do?
He just put my seat belt on.
The way he leaned across me wasn't-- It just-- And I felt....
I know it sounds stupid.
And then... ...Erin was shooting up. I saw her holding a needle.
...Erin was shooting up. I saw her holding a needle.
Anyway, she looked really baked.
Ruby.
Try and understand this.
The accident, in effect...
...orphaned you and your brother.
So if this doesn't work out with the Glasses...
...you've no place to go.
You'll become wards of the state.
I'm not trying to scare you.
I'm just telling you the facts of life.
I drove halfway here with the housekeeper...
...and then hitchhiked and I was scared.
But I told myself once I made it, you'd help me and Rhett.
When we met, you said I could trust you.
Okay.
All right.
I believe you. And I know who to get in touch with.
It's not gonna be easy. I can't promise you results.
But I promise you that I'll look into this. You have my word on that.
Thank you.
When we spoke after the funeral...
...you had said that...
...we had more than enough.
How much would that be exactly?
That's a question for the trust officer at the bank.
But between us, four million dollars.
So you can see, you're financially very secure.
Yeah.
Now why don't you go home. And do me one more favor?
No hitchhiking.
-This is out, okay? -Yes, sir.
Alvin Begleiter calling.
I just had a disturbing visit from Ruby Baker.
Rhett, why don't you leave that now?
Go and do some homework.
I have a lot of homework, too.
Stay a minute, would you?
What you saw last night isn't what you think.
Erin suffers from diabetes.
I hid it.
I don't want you or Rhett to worry. The disease is under control.
You saw Erin giving herself her nightly insulin injection.
Must've been a shock to walk in on.
One more thing.
Terry tells me that you got a little skittish with him last night.
That makes us feel sad. We want you to trust us, Ruby.
We need your trust.
I overreacted, I'm sorry.
There are still things I need to get used to.
We all do.
We're all under stress.
I'm gonna begin my Hamlet paper.
If you need help, let me know.
That'd be great.
That's fine. Put it in park and step out.
And Ruby? You'll get behind the wheel next.
You can apply a bit more gas.
Sorry, I'm a bad driver.
There aren't any bad, just inexperienced.
Take a breath, start driving back.
Bye.
He's not in now. I'll have him call you back.
Hi.
-I'm Ruby Baker. Terry's-- -I know who you are.
Okay. Cool.
I came to catch a ride from Terry.
He's having a powwow with some people now.
-If you wanna wait, there's a lounge. -Okay, thanks.
-Glass Transit, may I help you? -Any service technician to the office.
-What's going on, Terry? -The usual.
Not to worry. Nothing that can't be handled.
-We had a payment plan. -The dates arrive, the money doesn't.
About that payment plan Nicole had a day...
About that payment plan Nicole had a day... ...I'd call it unrealistic.
-You proposed that plan. -I know.
-It's not dishonesty. We gotta-- -What is it?
Naïve optimism.
But I'm an optimist by nature.
I'm betting on myself.
I'll be right there.
-Where's the money? -You're not listening. The money--
-Say is, as in, "the money is." -Yeah.
Can I help you?
-Whose car is this? -Hell if I know. Just showed up one day.
-One day, when? -I don't know. Few months ago?
-We had a car like this. -You really shouldn't be back here.
Ruby?
What happened was nothing. Just a business glitch.
Hope you didn't get freaked. People get weird about money.
I didn't mean to just show up. I waited for Vicki and she never came.
We had to let her go. Erin got held up at the hospital.
-Back up. You had to let Vicki go? -We had to.
She drove you without permission.
Just to Santa Monica, to the Promenade.
How did you know that she drove me?
How did we know? It's our job to know.
-Did you have a hard day at work? -It was fine, thanks.
Hamlet.
Don't you hate how he can't make up his mind?
To be, not be, not not be, be, be not.
My father drove a Saab.
Terry!
Thank you.
For finishing my paper.
That would be wrong.
-Ruby. -Yeah?
Come with me.
Sure.
Ruby Baker? I'm Nancy Ryan.
I'm an inspector with Social Services.
Your lawyer said you have problems with your guardians.
Please relax and be open. Everything said here stays private.
Please relax and be open. Everything said here stays private. Okay? So...
Okay? So... ...you're 16...
...and your brother is 11, and you share a bedroom?
Yeah, for now.
And you saw Erin Glass injecting herself?
-They said she has diabetes. -Diabetes? I'm gonna check that.
Now it's gonna be in writing twice.
My word still won't count next to the Glasses.
Which is why I'll phone the Glasses and ask them to meet me...
...so I can verify everything.
-Okay? -But...
...how can I live with them?
-Do you wanna live with them? -Sometimes things are fine.
Last night, Terry helped me with something...
Last night, Terry helped me with something... ...but maybe that was to keep me happy.
I know this is scary for you, but don't worry.
We tell the guardians that we perform a routine inspection.
If it's still in progress...
...you just act like we've never met or spoken.
You have no idea why I'm there. Okay?
This is my husband, Terry Glass. -Hello. -Hello.
-Hello. -Hello.
Is this necessary in the middle of the day?
We'll get this done as quickly as possible.
It's intrusive. Let's get it over with.
-May I...? -Of course.
Only one child sleeps here?
Yes, Rhett.
And the girl, Ruby, she has her own room?
-Of course. -She's 16.
Nice accommodations.
The kids are home. Do you want to meet them?
Yes, I would. Just to say hi.
But first, Dr. Glass, may I look upstairs?
This is awkward, but it's also important.
It's a matter of safety, so there's nothing...
...dangerous in easy reach.
-"Humulin L and U." -Diabetes. I'm insulin-dependent.
We have it totally under control.
It would appear that you do.
Here's the two best kids in the world.
Hi, you must be Rhett. I'm Nancy Ryan.
Nice to meet you.
So Rhett, how do you spend your evenings?
When I finish my homework, I read.
And you must be Ruby. You have a very nice room.
You've made a wonderful home for these children.
-Thank you, Dr. Glass. -Thank you.
We'll see you out.
You read? You lie.
Guess who I learned from?
Bye now.
Why don't we order some dinner, hon?
How do you like your new room?
Couldn't have come at a better time.
Come on, Mr. Begleiter.
-Hello? -Sorry to disturb you this late.
...but I found myself wondering, "Where's the money?"
You might as well know.
Six months ago I took on a partner. A silent partner and...
...I recently found out he was skimming cash.
You've lost me. What does this have to do with our loan?
I'm waiting, Mr. Glass.
-Mr. Glass, you still there? -Yeah.
He charged personal expenses to the company. When I want a heartbreaking human interest story...
When I want a heartbreaking human interest story...
...I'll watch the news.
Meanwhile, your payment's due tomorrow, close of business.
Do you fully understand me?
Mr. Glass?
I'm here.
I'm seeking full restitution from my partner.
Plus I found a whole new source of equity.
My big, new, personal piggy bank.
So you can expect another $30,000.
That barely covers interest. You need to pay off the principal.
But I need some more time. Not a lot more time.
A week at the most. We'll give you two days, because we like you.
We'll give you two days, because we like you.
We'd hate for you to find your beautiful house burnt down...
...with your wife inside.
Yeah?
"I unfold a tale whose word would harrow up thy soul...
...freeze thy young blood...
...make thy two eyes start from their spheres...
...and each hair to stand an end.
If thou didst thy father love...
...revenge his foul and unnatural murder. Murder most foul...
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural...."
Begleiter and Brice.
-This is Ruby Baker for Mr. Begleiter. -One moment.
-Did you get my e-mail? -No, Terry trashed my account.
Or maybe the bill didn't get paid.
Did you find out about the BMW?
Right, the BMW.
It was registered to a business: G.T.I.
Glass Transit Incorporated.
-Terry's company. -Now don't you get it?
Ruby, please come with me.
I have to call you back later. Bye-bye.
This is Miss Bassett, our vice principal.
Ruby. The paper you turned in to Mr. Kim, that was your work, nobody helped?
The paper you turned in to Mr. Kim, that was your work, nobody helped?
-No. -Not even Harold Bloom?
"Dance of contraries," didn't sound like a student.
I found it and other phrases in Mr. Bloom's book:
"Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human."
We were told there's a case of plagiarism on your school record.
You understand why we have to take decisive action--
You were told?
-By who? -That is hardly the issue here.
This sort of cheating has to have real consequences.
We've spoken to your guardians.
Of course you have.
Frankly, we're not sure whether you can continue at this school.
Well?
Why don't you ask Terry?
Or maybe it's time you took some responsibility.
Maybe it's time.
This is Jack Avery. I'm out of the country...
This is Jack Avery. I'm out of the country... ...but I'm checking my messages.
...but I'm checking my messages.
Wake up.
Don't make a sound. Get dressed. We're gonna go.
-Where? With who? -Away with me.
-Quit it! You're looking! -Like there's something to see.
It's raining. I was sleeping. I don't wanna go.
It'll be really fun.
They're giving away Dragon Ball Z at Blockbuster.
We can go and avoid the rush.
Really?
Close the door.
What if they find out?
I'll take the blame. Get in the car.
You don't know what you're doing.
Wanna slow down a little?
One thing I learned from Terry: Buckle up.
-Terry's gonna kill you! -Maybe so.
Turn that off.
Turn that shit off!
Look out!
You almost creamed that guy!
Right. Turn it off!
-I wanna go back. -We're not.
-What do you mean? -Figure it out.
We have to! You tricked me and now I'm in trouble.
-The Glasses tricked you. -What?
Did not. They're sleeping.
They were gonna send me away and you'd stay home with them.
I like Terry. I like Erin.
You like the shit they buy you. You couldn't see it.
You like the shit they buy you. You couldn't see it. They made you lie to that social worker.
They made you lie to that social worker.
I didn't know she was a social worker.
You didn't wanna lose your Nintendo.
They bought you off.
-Where are you taking us? -The point was to get away.
Crap.
Don't say anything stupid.
The highway is closed.
There's a mudslide. You need to use Malibu Canyon....
-Can I see your driver's license? -My license?
-And your registration too. -It's....
It's over there in all my stuff.
I think I saw it over here.
Pull onto the shoulder and step out.
Officer!
These are my kids.
Terry Glass, Glass Transit.
-We loaned you limos for the parade. -How are you?
Rhett, poor baby! Come with me. We have a behavior problem back at home.
We have a behavior problem back at home.
Your sister's going through a hard time right now.
-You know, teenage-girl stuff. -Got you.
Good luck.
Move over.
-You can turn around here. -Thanks.
Don't you have anything to say to me?
You killed my parents.
That's insane and hurtful.
You're threatened by your business associates. I saw it.
Like Erin said to me, "We need your trust."
You need my trust, $4 million worth.
I got a business. My wife's a successful doctor.
-I got a big, new-- -"Piggy bank."
That's just words out of context.
-What about the BMW my dad drove? -What about it?!
For their anniversary, I lent them a Beemer...
...so Dave wouldn't drive her in that Saab...
...which I repainted.
No good deed goes unpunished.
In your trashy mind, you twisted that into--
What do you think? Cut the steering, stripped the brakes?
Yeah.
It's understandable, basic psychology.
You don't wanna blame your dad.
That he had too much booze that night.
Then you'd ask why your mom and dad... ...hit the bottle. Whose behavior drove them to drink?
...hit the bottle. Whose behavior drove them to drink?
Get this straight.
You and Rhett are mine.
I suggest you forget your lurid, adolescent fantasies and start--
Help!
-Let me go, bastard! -Calm down, little girl!
What's happening out there?
Your sister is having a tantrum.
Come on. Come back to bed.
Let me go! Get off!
Let go!
You...!
Listen hard, Ruby.
Anything happens to you, we got Rhett... ...and all we need is one child.
...and all we need is one child.
Erin! Stop him, please!
Erin!
Please come help me, please! He's not gonna hurt you!
Erin, please don't! Erin, don't! No!
Thank you for listening.
You'll feel better now, Ruby. Rest, relax.
-Where to, ladies? -The mall. Time out. Has anyone heard from Ruby?
Time out. Has anyone heard from Ruby?
-Me? Not for a month. -Same. Won't even answer my e-mails.
What up with Little Miss Malibu? Too busy bodysurfing?
Then we are too busy for her.
-Hello? -Where's the rest of our money?
The bank sent me a check with the wrong zip code.
Some incompetent jerk at the bank inverted the last digits!
So I'll need another--
We gotta expand the house, a wing for the kids.
Our little boy gets bigger every day, and the girl is a teen.
I don't know if you have kids....
Anyway, construction costs in Malibu are off the charts.
I'm estimating a quarter million.
We'll need to see blueprints. There's an approval process.
You can't get them without an architect.
Mine wants a cash down payment. He's in demand.
I believe we advanced you...
...$30,000 for that purpose just last month.
But that was for a room, before I realized I needed a wing.
Isn't a guardian supposed to keep the kids comfortable?
Here's the trust.
It authorizes me to use money to enlarge the house.
And guardians aren't supposed to suffer economically...
...in fulfilling their obligations? I'm paying two tuitions.
I employ a nanny. The kids see therapists to deal with the tragedy.
I plan trips to broaden their horizons...
... and it's like a root canal when I need reimbursement.
-Where'd you get it? -You faxed it to us last week.
I'm surprised to hear you have both children at Westcott.
Did I say Westcott? We changed our minds about it. It's too glitzy.
-We gotta do what's best for them. -Isn't that the truth?
Thank you for waiting. I'll take your order.
I need five dozen 10cc syringes fentanyl...
...and I need two dozen 20cc syringes Demerol.
We sent up 60 of fentanyl on Monday.
I doubled the PCA infusion rate of Demerol in six patients.
Dr. Glass?
I'm on the phone with the pharmacy.
Dr. Wise wants to see you.
The Medical Director.
Wake up, Ruby.
Sleeping Beauty.
All you do is sleep. It scares me.
So you're losing your medical license. That's wonderful.
-I have a sickness. -Yeah, it's called self-pity.
Complicated by being born without a freaking backbone.
So I'm weak, am I?
Maybe I am.
At least I'm not greedy and reckless...
...borrowing a million from loan sharks--
Which should've been paid off! We had a good thing going...
...till you put your hand in.
A good thing? You son of a bitch!
-I was a doctor! -Yeah, but you became a junkie.
Not until you did what you did.
Where were you when I did it?
Right. I saw an opportunity, Erin.
I saw an opportunity and grabbed it.
I had what you didn't. I had the nerve, the will.
Since nobody gave me a chance, I took it.
I'm not doing this anymore.
It's already done.
This is about containing the damage. Understand?
Good.
You know we have to get rid of the girl.
Speaking of which, we're dry?
There's nothing to take care of her, so I'll get something.
If I can't find drugs in L.A....
Hi!
Wave at the camera, Ruby. Wave at the camera!
They can't catch me!
-Come in the water, Erin! -Wait! I'm coming too!
Spin me, Erin! Faster! -Good girl.
Rhett. Rhett, move away.
Erin! It took some doing...
...but I found some pharmaceutical morphine.
Erin?
God, not now.
Erin?
1875 Montego Canyon.
I thought you'd wanna know.
Ruby?
Honey?
Terry needs to talk to you kids.
You kids are a handful, you know that?
Where's your sister? Where's your damn sister?
I should've put you here from day one.
What's happening?
He got the Jag.
-He walked back in the house. -Keep working.
He's sleeping.
He fell asleep. There's gonna be a change of plans.
Why would he do that?
He's bombed!
He finished a bottle of vodka. It's right there.
I see what's weird.
Begleiter! What's going on?
You ought to have your wife take a look at that.
-She's not home. -Your office said you were home.
I kept calling but nobody answered, so here I am.
The bank blocked your guardianship account.
The officer believes there's malfeasance.
The sons of bitches!
I went out on a limb for you.
I warned you about the girl's claims...
I warned you about the girl's claims... ...about her accusations, because I trusted you, as did the Bakers.
...about her accusations, because I trusted you, as did the Bakers.
But if you've lied, the courts will step in.
If they take these children, they have no place to go.
He thought he was helping us.
Mr. Glass, where are the children?
At their music lessons. Their piano lessons.
Next, I'll have to buy them a Steinway...
...and the bank will say, "Can't they play the kazoo?"
Shit!
That's my Testarossa.
No, that's our Testarossa. Until we get our money back.
You planned to skip town today?
You planned to skip town today? Where'd you get that idea?
Where'd you get that idea? -Your wife called us this morning. -My wife?
-Your wife called us this morning. -My wife?
Before you leave, how about repay the loan in one lump cash sum.
He doesn't have our money.
-What's going on, Terry? -Ask him.
-Your partner? -Bastard robbed me blind.
-Oh, my God. I'm leaving. -No, no, no.
-You're not. -Really?
-We need an explanation. -From me?
I have nothing to do with this!
-Nobody listens anymore. -Are you happy, Terry?
Feel good about that? Terry, you're a troublemaker.
-That took care of the problem. -No. We'll discuss this in the car.
There's nothing to discuss!
Just walk like a man out to the Jag.
That was the problem. You solved it.
The rest is pure profit.
Not the Jag. The Volvo.
Wait here for a minute, okay?
-Nice little drive in our car. -No! Not in there!
Not in there! No! Not in there!
I don't even have the key!
We got all the keys to all the cars.
Take the Volvo, not the Jag!
-Let's go! -Okay, you win!
-You win. -It's over.
Just please take the Volvo, okay?
You're making this difficult.
-Whatever. -Take the Volvo.
Brand loyalty. I like that.
That little bitch!
You're some kind of joker. We'll take the Jaguar.
You're some kind of joker. We'll take the Jaguar. No!
You haven't been to our Tarzana office.
We got a handball court and a sauna...
...and way in the back we have this special room.
Totally soundproof.
What the--?
What the--?
What'd you do to this car?! What'd you do to this car?!
Hi, you guys need some help?
Yes.
-Everything under control? -We got it covered.
Terry.
You two kids stay in the car.
I have a possible T.C. Southbound, Malibu Canyon.
-I'll be investigating. -Copy that.
I have a rollover T.C... ...with one fatality. I'll need two backup units.
...with one fatality. I'll need two backup units.
Ruby.
It's okay.
Ruby, go! Drive!
-Where's the stupid key?! -It's okay!
We're gonna die here! Let's go! Come on, find them!
Ruby!
I need your help.
-He's getting closer! -I got them!
He's getting closer!
Drive! Drive! Drive!
Why are you stopping?!
It's okay, honey.
-Buckle up. -What're you doing?!
-All's forgiven. -What're you doing?
You kids okay? Go back and wait by my car.
Things will get easier from here on.
Technicals, 9 o'clock.
Oh, shit! Did you see that?
Chief, we got unarmed civilians getting shot down here at 9 o'clock.
I got it, Matt. I don't think we can touch this.
Command, Super 64... ...we got militia shooting civilians at the food distribution center.
...we got militia shooting civilians at the food distribution center.
Request permission to engage.
Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.
Negative, Command.
U.N.'s jurisdiction, 64. We cannot intervene.
U.N.'s jurisdiction, 64. We cannot intervene. -Return to base. Over. -Roger.
-Return to base. Over. -Roger. 64 returning.
Leaving.
General Garrison?
No, thanks. I got one.
But these are Cuban.
Bolivar Belicoso.
So is this.
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.
I see not catching Aidid is becoming a routine.
We weren't trying to catch Aidid. We were trying to catch you.
Me?
But am I that important?
I hardly think so.
-You're just a businessman. -Trying to make a living.
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.
You've been here, what?
Six weeks?
Six weeks you are trying to catch the general.
You put up reward posters.
$25,000. What is this? Gunfight at the K.O. Corral?
It's the O.K. Corral.
Do you think bringing me in will make him suddenly come to you?
Make him more agreeable?
You know where he sleeps.
You pay for his beds, much less his militia.
We're not leaving Somalia till we find him.
And we will find him. Don't think because I grew up without running water...
Don't think because I grew up without running water... ...I am simple, general.
I do know something about history.
See all this? It's simply shaping tomorrow.
A tomorrow without a lot of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.
Well, I wouldn't know about that. I'm from Texas.
Mr. Garrison, I think you shouldn't have come here.
This is civil war.
This is our war.
Not yours.
300,000 dead and counting.
That's not a war, Mr. Atto. That's genocide.
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?
How'd he strike you?
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.
Yeah, he's a good catch.
It'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.
I'm not sure time is something we got in great supply.
This isn't Iraq, you know. Much more complicated than that.
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.
They've been calling for situation reports every morning this week.
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.
I'll be your pilot today.
Federal regulations designate this a non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.
Those in our Mogadishu frequent flyer program will earn 100 free credits.
And as always, the air sickness bags are in the seatback in front of you.
Number one indications are good, Cliff. Put her on two.
You're still clear.
61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.
I've got some bad news.
"Limo" is a word, Durant. I don't want to hear about it.
It is not a word. It's an abbreviation of a word.
"Limo" is a word in common usage.
That is the key phrase in Scrabble, my good friend. Common usage.
If it's not in the dictionary it doesn't count!
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!
It does have to be in the dictionary!
When we get back to the base, it's coming off.
You touch my "limo" and I'll spank you, Nightstalker.
Yeah, promises.
That's a nice beach down there.
How's the water?
Yeah, it's nice and warm. And it's loaded with sharks.
-Name. -Todd.
-Last name. -Blackburn.
First name, Todd.
-So, what's it like? -What's what like?
Mogadishu. The fighting. -Serial number. -72163427.
-Serial number. -72163427.
Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog." No one calls it Mogadishu here.
Secondly, I wouldn't know about the fighting, so don't ask.
Why not? Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?
You look like you're about 12, so let me explain something to you.
I have a rare and mysterious skill that precludes me from doing missions.
Typing.
-Can you type? -No.
-Date of birth. -2-27-75.
Well, I'm here to kick some ass.
Let's bring it in.
Nice, man! Very smooth!
Single shot through the engine block.
Shit, that's a shame. That was a nice jeep.
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Check your weapons!
Sergeant Eversmann.
-Sergeant. -Yeah?
Private First Class Blackburn. Yeah?
-Reporting for duty. -Not to me.
You're reporting to Lieutenant Beales. He should be here somewhere.
Can I leave him with you? Yeah, go ahead.
-You brought your weapon. -Yes, sir.
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.
-When did you get in? -Just now, sergeant.
Hey, who's hungry?
What is this, sergeant? Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?
-Not if General Garrison is asking. -I'm asking.
Have a nice meal, captain.
-Hey, man, there's a line. -I know.
-Well, this isn't the back of it. -Yeah, I know.
Sergeant. Sergeant.
What's going on here?
Some aerial target practice, sir. Didn't want to leave it behind.
I'm talking about your weapon.
Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.
You know better than that. Safety should be on at all times on base.
Well, this is my safety, sir.
Let it go, sir. The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.
You Delta boys are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.
Let me tell you something, sergeant.
When we get on the five-yard line, you're gonna need my Rangers.
Y'all better learn to be team players.
We're done here.
Speak up. You say this is your safety?
Well, this is my boot, son.
And it will fit up your ass with the proper amount of force.
-Is that a Jersey accent? -I'm trying to do this, give me a break.
Take those sunglasses off.
Delta wants to wear Oakleys, that's their business.
I don't want to see them on you again.
Is that a hot weapon?
Is that your move?
Is my hand on the piece?
I can mate you in three whatever you do.
I'd keep my eye on that queen before counseling others.
Well, she's just lying in wait.
Yikes.
It's good. You're really improving.
If I may make a suggestion-- Observation.
Go ahead. -It's a children's book, right? -Right.
-It's a children's book, right? -Right.
They are not supposed to scare the living shit out of the children.
This is the part of the story where our knight is slaying the dragon.
This is the part of the story where our knight is slaying the dragon. That's scary. Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.
That's scary. Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.
Thought you finished that last week.
You done?
Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men. You understand?
Can you count? One, two, 10.
Okay? Where are my running backs?
Where are my running backs?
Hey, I didn't see you at church on Sunday.
You had something more important to do?
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.
I will make you believe, you understand?
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?
It was a good impression. I recognize myself.
All right, carry on.
-I'd like a word, specialist. -Sir.
You understand why we have a chain of command, don't you?
Roger that, sir. If you ever undermine me again, you'll clean latrines with your tongue...
If you ever undermine me again, you'll clean latrines with your tongue...
...till you taste no difference between shit and french fries. -Are we clear? -Hoo-ah, sir.
All right.
Listen to this: If one skinny kills another...
...his clan owes the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.
A hundred camels. Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.
Is that really true, lieutenant?
Ask Sergeant Eversmann. He likes skinnies.
Sergeant Eversmann, you really like the skinnies?
It's not that I like them or I don't like them. I respect them.
See, what you guys fail to realize is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.
He believes in this mission down to his bones. Don't you, sergeant?
Look, these people, they have no jobs...
...no food, no education, no future.
I just figure that, I mean, we have two things that we can do.
We can help...
...or we can sit back and watch the country destroy itself on CNN.
Right?
I don't know about you guys, but I was trained to fight.
Are you trained to fight, sergeant?
Well, I think I was trained to make a difference, Kurth.
Like the man said, he's an idealist.
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.
Stay away from the cans!
Die, gas pumper!
Stay away from those cans!
Beales!
No, no, stay back. He's having a seizure. Put something in his mouth.
He's having a seizure. Put something in his mouth.
John, it's okay. John, it's okay. It's okay.
Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.
He's out of the game. He's epileptic, going home.
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk. -You got a problem with that? -No, sir.
It's a big responsibility.
Your men will look to you to make the right decisions. Their lives depend on it.
All right.
-Rangers lead the way, sir. -All the way.
Good luck.
A meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet may take place today at 1500 hours.
I say "may" because we all know by now...
...with the intel we get on the street, nothing is certain.
This is actual intel confirmed by three sources.
Two tier-one personalities may be present:
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...
...and Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister. These are the guys we're after.
Today we go.
Same mission template as before.
1545, Assault Force Delta will infiltrate the target building...
1545, Assault Force Delta will infiltrate the target building... ...and seize all suspects within.
Security Force Rangers: four Ranger chalks...
...under command of Captain Steele, will rope in at 1546...
...under command of Captain Steele, will rope in at 1546... ...and hold a four-corner perimeter around the target building.
No one gets in or out.
Extraction Force:
Lieutenant Colonel McKnight's humvee column will drive in at 1547...
...on Hawlwadig Road and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel.
Wait for the green light.
Now once Delta gives the word... ...McKnight's column will go to the target...
...and load the prisoners onto trucks.
Immediately after the prisoners are loaded...
...the four Ranger chalks will collapse back to the target building...
...load up on humvees...
...and the entire ground force will exfil the three miles back to base.
Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.
Now, I had requested light armor and AC-130 Spectre gunships...
...but Washington, in all its wisdom, decided against this.
Too high-profile.
So Black Hawks and Little Birds will provide the air cover...
...with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.
Colonel Harrell.
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews will coordinate the air mission...
...and I will coordinate ground forces.
Colonel Matthews. Mission launch code word is Irene.
Questions?
Which building is it, sir?
We're confirming that now. Somewhere near the Bakara market.
I don't choose the time or place of their meetings.
I didn't say a word, sir.
Make no mistake, once you're in the Bakara market...
Make no mistake, once you're in the Bakara market... ...you're in an entirely hostile district.
Don't underestimate their capabilities.
We'll be in friendly neighborhoods before we hit the market...
...so remember the rules of engagement: No one fires unless fired upon.
Now, let's go get this thing done.
Good luck, gentlemen.
What's the matter, Danny? Something you don't like?
No Spectre gunships, daylight instead of night...
...afternoon when they're all fucked up on khat...
...only part of the city Aidid can mount a counter-attack on short notice....
-What's not to like? -Life's imperfect.
For you two, circling above it at 500 feet, it's imperfect.
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.
What the fuck, Smith?
-Well? -Well, what?
We going?
-Why should I tell you that? -Because I'm me.
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown. -Bakara market. -All right.
Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up out there today, all right?
Keep sharp.
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.
Nothing.
It's all in the grind, Sizemore. Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.
This, my friend, is a science.
You're looking at the guy that believed the commercials.
About "be all you can be."
I made coffee through Desert Storm.
I made coffee through Panama, while everyone else got to fight...
I made coffee through Panama, while everyone else got to fight... ...got to be a Ranger.
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar" or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"
-What happened to you? -Ping-Pong accident.
What?
So guess what.
Your wish has been granted. You're going out today.
You're fucking me.
You're taking my place assisting the 60 gunner.
Sergeant Eversmann said to get your stuff and get ready.
It's what you wanted, isn't it? Oh, yeah.
Hell, yeah.
Grimesy, stick with Waddell and give him ammo when he needs it. -Hoo-ah? -Hoo-ah.
I wouldn't worry about that. Generally speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.
Just watch out for the sammys throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.
Might even be fun.
D-boys do their thing now. All we got to do is cover them.
D-boys do their thing now. All we got to do is cover them. Choppers going to cover us, and we'll be all right.
Look, you guys, this is my first time as chalk leader...
Look, you guys, this is my first time as chalk leader... ...but this isn't our first time out together. This is serious.
...but this isn't our first time out together. This is serious.
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.
We're elite.
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?
Any questions?
We're going to be okay.
Grab your gear. Let's move out.
You're not going to need that, dude. We're not out there long enough.
You won't need that, either. We'll be back before dark.
You might as well take dope and beer instead.
What?
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.
Let me tell you something, Grimes. You got 50 pounds of gear.
Let me tell you something, Grimes. You got 50 pounds of gear. You don't need another 12.
I don't know about you, I don't plan on getting shot running away.
Well, I better keep mine in.
Grimes. Most important thing:
Remember, when everyone is shooting, shoot in the same direction.
Look at this. He's taping his blood type to his boots.
-That's bad luck. -No, it's smart.
All Delta do that.
That's bad luck too, man.
Come on, let's go.
It's a good thing you're right-handed, Adonis.
-If not, I don't know what you'd do. -You're a funny guy, man.
-I'm not taking no death letter. -We have a deal.
I'll give it to you back in an hour.
-Blackburn, you okay? -Excited.
In a good way. I've been training my whole life for this.
You ever shot at anybody before?
No, sir.
Me neither.
Think he's reliable? Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.
Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.
-Tell him to turn his damn radio off. -Yes, sir. Tell him to turn his radio off.
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.
Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy.
Leave us a message. Thank you.
Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?
Pick up if you're there.
I'm just calling to make sure everything's all right.
I'll call you in a couple hours.
You'd better not be sleeping.
Your move, Randy.
I'm missing you.
I love you, baby.
Hello? Hello?
Thanks, bud.
You know, it's kind of funny.
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.
Could almost be a good place to visit. Almost.
You don't think we should be here.
You know what I think? It don't really matter what I think.
Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics and all that shit...
Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics and all that shit... ...just goes right out the window.
I just want to do it right today.
Just watch your corner. Get all your men back here alive.
Now, is this supposed to be the place, or did his car just take a dump?
Abdi, come in.
Abdi, can you hear me? Is this the place?
Abdi, come in.
Can you hear me? Abdi.
Abdi, come in. Is this the place?
To my right side, above the café.
He says this is the building. He's certain?
Abdi, you need to be sure.
Are you sure?
Well, it's down the road, two blocks over on my left.
But there's too many militia.
If I go closer, they might shoot me.
Now he's saying the building's a couple blocks down...
...but if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.
I'll fucking shoot him myself.
Tell him I want his skinny ass parked in front of the building.
He's not getting paid till he does exactly that.
Three miles to the target. We're never off the main roads.
At K-4 traffic circle, we turn north, then east on National...
...and we wait until extraction of prisoners is complete here.
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig, load the prisoners...
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig, load the prisoners... ...the assault-blocking forces and bring them back.
Home in an hour. Okay?
There will be some shooting. Bakara market is the Wild West.
But be careful what you shoot at. People do live there.
Last one of these guys shot himself in the head playing Russian roulette.
Sir, the vehicle is stopped.
So this is the real deal now. He's sure this time.
-He sounds scared shitless. -Good. That's always a good sign.
That's it. That's our signal.
That's it. That's our signal. All right.
All QRF out of the airspace.
All QRF out of the airspace.
All units, Irene. I say again, Irene.
Check in when ready. Barber 51 up and ready. Star 41 up and ready.
Irene!
Copy, Irene.
Fucking Irene!
Come on.
Good luck, boys. Be careful.
No one gets left behind.
What's wrong?
Nothing. He's just never done that before.
Fuck!
Let's go.
Sergeant Struecker. Let's roll.
Two minutes.
Two minutes.
Why are they burning tires?
Signals to the militia that we're coming!
Okay, 56, looks like there's some friendlies on the ground.
Looks like I've got a tally on the voice.
One minute.
One minute.
What's that for?
Last rope, I almost bit my tongue off.
Touching base.

Nothing takes five minutes!
What happened to him?

Put him in that humvee! Grimes, give him a hand!

He looks real bad. I need to evac now.
Roger that, Uniform 64. We'll chop a team of gun ships to you. Over.
Roger that.
I need extra security on these humvees!
I'll go. I'll take my team, make sure they get back okay.
Do it. Struecker, you're lead humvee.
First three vehicles mount up, we're moving back to base.
Move out!
How are things going? Things okay there, Struecker?
I don't want to talk about it now, colonel!
I'm busy.
Sergeant Pilla's hit!
Christ, he's fucked up!
Is anyone hit?
Struecker, talk to me!
It's Sergeant Pilla!
What's his status?
What's his status?
He's dead.

Hold on!
We got a Black Hawk down. We got a Black Hawk down.
Super 61 is down. We got a bird down in the city.
Super 61 is on the deck now.
Get an MH-6 on site. Check for survivors.
Send in the SAR bird.
I want ground forces to move. Secure a new perimeter around that crash site.
Can you guide the convoy in there? Roger that.
Well, move quick.
The whole city will be coming down on top of them.
Star 41, come inbound and see if you can land at the crash site.
Roger that. Star 41 inbound.
We just lost the initiative.
25, this is 64. Over.
25. Over.
25, Chalk Four is closest to the crash site. Over.
64, I can't see the crash site. Over.

Check for survivors. Secure the area. All other chalks will follow.
-25, do you read me? Over. -Roger that.
Galentine! Schmid!
Get Yurek. Get Twombly.
Hey, there's a Black Hawk down.
Twombly, Nelson, stay here.
Hold this corner and then exfil with the humvees.
Galentine, Schmid, you're coming with me. Let's go.
How come I got to stay back here? Because you're dependable.
All right.
Let's go!
I hate being dependable, man.
Juliet 25, hostiles advancing, parallel west to your position.
Women and children among them. Over.
Hit the wall.
Incoming!
Grenade!
Go.
We still got guys inside!
I'll go to the crash.
You take the rest of the team. I'll finish loading the prisoners.
No! We'll go to the crash site together.
Secure the perimeter, wait for the humvees.
-Roger that. -Follow my lead.
Sergeant, are you receiving me?
Yeah, I heard you. We should be leaving soon.
All right, we need to move out now! I'll finish loading the prisoners and pick you up at the crash site!
I'll finish loading the prisoners and pick you up at the crash site!
Let's move out! Moving out! Go!

Maddox, look at these jerks! These idiots!
Go, go! Right, Maddox, right!
Twombly, the convoy is leaving!
Hey, Twombly!
What?
-I think they've forgotten us. -What?
It doesn't matter.
63 confirm. Skinnies are moving in on all sides. They need help now.
Indigenous personnel advancing to Wolcott crash site.
Say again. Over.
A lot of people closing in.
How far is Chalk Four from the crash site?
-Six blocks, sir. -They need to haul ass.
Get down! Get down!
Scotty, are you okay?
No, don't go back!
Get down! Get down!
Technicals!
Got them!
Six o'clock! Move, move!
Go, go, go!
Go, go!
Come on!
Yurek, leaving!
Come on!
Uniform 64, left turn. Left turn.
Romeo 64, I need to know before I get to the goddamn street!
You have to slow down. There's a delay.
From the time directions are relayed from surveillance to JOC, then to me.
We can't slow down! We're taking heavy enemy fire!
We can't slow down!
Danny, I'm getting information from Orion surveillance above.
So get me my fucking directions to the crash site!
Danny, hold on. I no longer have the best view of your route.
Get your ass in the right place, goddamn it!
What in the hell is the status of Struecker's humvees?
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base, Struecker's column.
ETA to base momentarily.
Open the gate!
-Get him out! Let's go! Let's go! -Come on.
Watch his head.
Easy.
Blackburn, can you hear me?
Star 41 is at the crash site to evacuate the injured. Over.
Roger that.
I got you.
Easy.
Galentine, you all right?
Galentine, Kurth, with me! Cover fire, now.
Full cover!
How many are in there?
Two pilots are dead, two crew chiefs are wounded!
He's hurt bad. We must get out of here.
All right. Go ahead.
26, this is 25. Is that you shooting up the technicals?
This is 26. Roger that.
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner. We're setting up a perimeter. Over.
This is 26. Roger that. Moving there now.
Move out!
Captain Steele, come in.
Go ahead, 25. This is 64.
We got two wounded and we got both the pilots dead in the chopper!
We need a medivac now!
It's too hot to land a bird. You must secure the perimeter first. Over.
Where are the humvees?
Be advised, 25, the convoy will be there.
They're encountering a lot of resistance. 64 out.
Get the 50 up!
You should see the crash directly ahead.
All I see is a roadblock!
I'll have to figure out another way.
Give me a defensive perimeter so we can load the wounded.
Fire your weapon, Othic!
Tell my girls I'll be okay.
Othic!
Medic!
Medic! Medic!
Joyce! Joyce! Come on, help me pick him up!
Get us off this fucking street! Where's the crash site? Say again.
Keep going straight 200 meters.
Roger that.
Let's go!
Let's go, goddamn it, let's go!
Hey, Twombles. Come here.
The humvees ain't coming back, dude.
What?
Were we supposed to go to them?
I thought they were coming to us.
-I think we're supposed to go to them. -Shit.
Okay.
Let's go to the crash site.
Okay. Don't fire that thing so close to my head. I can barely hear as it is.
Don't fire that thing so close to my head. I can barely hear as it is.
Move out.
Shit! Get down!
What did I just tell you? If you do that again--
You okay? Nelson.
-You all right? -What?
Search and rescue bird on station inserting medics.
Go, go!
Son of a bitch. C-2, this is 68. We've been hit.
Super 68, there is smoke coming from the top of your rotor.
-Advise you to come out now. -Roger.
-Advise you to come out now. -Roger. Dropping last man.
Art, I've got skinnies with RPGs at 12 o'clock. Can you see them?
Got them. Give me 90 degrees left.
68 coming out.
Super 68 is out. Over.
Hey, Wilkie, what's the situation in there?
Both pilots are dead.
25, we can't move these guys, Matty.
We'll kill them just carrying them.
-Stabilize in here? -Roger.
Stabilize in the bird. Repeat: Stabilize in here. Over.
Understood, Wilkie. We got you covered. Over.
Super 64, come inbound and take Wolcott's position.
Roger. 64 is inbound.
Super 64, you all right?
This is Super 64. We're good.
You sure? You look like you got clipped pretty good.
Instrument panels are okay.
No, we're good. Got a slight vibration in the pedals, but we're good.
All right, put her down on the airfield, 64.
Have it checked out just to be safe.
Roger.
I'm getting movement in these pedals. Check the systems again.
We lost the tail rotor! It's gone!
64 is going down!
64 is going in hard.
64 going down.
We're going down.
Get Struecker's column back out there.
They need to get to Durant's crash site fast.
-Another bird down. -I want them out of there.
All of them.
Captain Steele, we got to move or we'll get pinned down!
We're moving as fast as we can.
You let me do my job and you do yours. Over.
-Fuck! Fuck! -Ruiz, stay down. Medic!
Fuck this! Captain Steele, I'll take out the threat in the window.
We'll rally at the gray building. Coming through.
-Sergeant! -All right, let's move!
Cover me!
-Let's go, let's move! -Moving out.
Friendly! Friendlies coming through!
Let's go, let's go! Move up!
Come on, come on!
Come on!
Move up! Go! Move up!
What the fuck are you doing out there?
Doing my job! We got to get to that crash site!
We got to get on that street, and we got to move!
And you have got to keep up, sir!
Don't you ever give me orders, sergeant.
We are combat ineffective, understand?
We got too many wounded to move!
Then give me some shooters and I'll circle us to the bird.
Grimes! You're with Chalk Four?
Grimes! You're with Chalk Four? Yes, sir!
All right, hook up with Delta! Rejoin with Sergeant Eversmann.
The rest of you, secure this position!
Treat the wounded, we'll wait for the convoy!
Then we'll rally at the crash site. Roger!
My guys, let's go!
C-2, I have two Delta snipers, Shughart and Gordon...
...volunteering to secure crash site two. Over.
No, Super 62, negative that request. Can't risk another bird.
We don't see anything moving down there.
We don't even know if anyone's alive.
A ground team is being organized to go in now.
ETA on ground team? Over.
Unknown, not long.
Do what you can from the air.
All right, gather around!
Durant's 64 is down. We're going back in to get him!
Durant's 64 is down. We're going back in to get him! That's crazy. Is there anyone alive?
That's crazy. Is there anyone alive?
Doesn't matter, no one gets left behind.
We're wasting time here.
Refit and max out ammo and grenades, you got five!
Sizemore, where are you going?
-With you guys. -Not with that cast on, you're not.
All right, all right, all right. Go get your k-pot.
Talk to me.
I can't go back out there.
Thomas, everyone feels the same way you do. All right?
It's what you do right now that makes a difference.
It's your call.
It'll probably help to wash the blood out of the humvees.
Sergeant Struecker!
Sergeant Struecker! Can I go, sarge?
-You got some ammo? -Roger, sarge!
Hop in!
Wait!
Let's go, Thomas. Get in!
Which way?
-That way, I think! -Not so fucking loud.
Nice donkey.
Rangers?
Who?
It's Yurek! You fucking assholes!
Fuck!
Dude, we almost fucking killed you!
-Come to us! -Fuck you, come to me.
Sorry, sarge!
Dude, where the fuck have you been?
Never mind, you brought NOD, right?
No, I didn't, and you want to know why?
Because you said, "You won't need that, we'll be back in a half-hour."
Well, I wasn't saying it to you.
Nelson, cover this way.
We'll need night vision. What's the matter with you?
Oh, he's deaf. It's my fault.
-We need to get out of here! -That way.
We can't be far from the crash. Which way?
I thought you might know.
Let's move out.
Nelson, Twombly? Come in. Over.
Nelson, Twombly, this is Galentine.
We need a position of the convoy. Over.
I can't raise them, sergeant.
Sir, let's get the fuck out of here and evac!
-Let's move out. -Back to the stronghold!
Come on!
Ground forces have occupied several buildings along Marehan Road...
...but they're all spread out.
Eversmann's Chalk Four has set up a perimeter around Wolcott's crash site.
DiTomasso is in the adjacent structure.
Captain Steele and about 40 men, Rangers, are here...
...a couple blocks away. They're banged up pretty bad.
He set up a casualty collection point, I don't think they'll be able to move.
Sergeant Sanderson and a small Delta team...
...are moving from Steele's position to the crash site as we speak.
Draw off fire!
When this asshole stops to reload, cover me!
-Go! -Sir.
Again!
Loading!
Keep going!
I'm jammed!
I got it!
No, shit!
RPG!
You all right? You okay?
Yeah. I can hear bells ringing.
Come on! Come on!
Go!
A crowd is advancing six, seven blocks from the crash.
Shughart and Gordon again request permission...
...to secure until convoy arrives. Over.
General, crowds are in the hundreds now.
From where they are, they can see things clearer than any of us.
They know what they're asking.
Let me talk to them.
This is Garrison. I want to make sure that you understand what you're asking...
I want to make sure that you understand what you're asking... ...so say it out loud and clear.
We're asking to go in and set up a perimeter until ground support arrives.
You realize that I cannot tell you when that might be, it could take a while.
-Roger that. -You still want to go in there?
Yes, sir.
-Colonel Harrell? -Yes, general?
It's your call.
Roger that.
Goffena, put them in.
RPG!
Set up your perimeter!
There's a fucking rocket in him, sir!
Othic, calm down, goddamn it! There's live ordnance, now get out!
Son of a bitch.
All right, lift him up! Lift him up! Easy, easy!
All right, lift him up! Lift him up! Easy, easy! All right, get him in there! Good, good! Easy, easy!
All right, get him in there! Good, good! Easy, easy!
Get in that truck and drive. -But I'm shot, colonel. -Everybody's shot.
-But I'm shot, colonel. -Everybody's shot. We need the prisoners! Let's go!
Surveillance says to take Hawlwadig, then go straight.
McKnight, we need you to turn around and head back to Hawlwadig.
You're shitting me! We just came through there!
There must be a better route!
That's the info I'm getting from JOC...
...you need to turn around and head back.
Roger that. Roger that.
I cannot believe this shit! Turn us around, Maddox.
They're trying to get us fucking killed!
Just get it over with! Drive! Goddamn!
Get us out of here, goddamn it, drive!
Keep your foot on the gas!
Keep your foot on the gas!
Fuck!
Shit.
C-2, Shughart and Gordon are on the deck. Over.
Roger.
Friendlies!
God, it's good to see you!
It's good to see you. How bad?
My leg's broken and my back feels kind of weird.
We've got to get you out of here.
I'm pulling him out! Cover!
Wait, I--
I'm putting you down.
C-2, we're at the 64 crash site, securing perimeter.
-You all right? -Yeah, I'm good.
You're locked and loaded.
Any skinnies come around these corners, you watch our backs.
Any skinnies come around these corners, you watch our backs. -Where's the rescue squad? -We're it.
-Where's the rescue squad? -We're it.
All right, stop, stop, Maddox. Stop.
Son of a bitch.
Romeo 64, we're back where we started.
I'm low on ammo, I got many wounded including me...
I'm low on ammo, I got many wounded including me... ...vehicles that are barely running.
Okay, Danny, I need a no-b.s. assessment here.
Can you get to the crash site?
Colonel, I can't see shit.
Negative. With the amount of wounded we have, we'd do more harm than good.
With the amount of wounded we have, we'd do more harm than good.
We need to come back to base, rearm, regroup, and then we can go back out.
Roger.
C-2, bring them back. Get them out of there.
Roger. Return to base.
We're going home!
Let's go. Left.
Roger that. Understand. Convoy returning to base.
-What's up? -They're sending them back.
The convoy's headed back to base camp. Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?
We need to exfil the wounded now and get out of here before it's too late!
If Colonel McKnight went back to base, then he had a good reason.
It changes nothing.
All right, listen up.
We're going to hold the perimeter and we're going to hold the strongpoint.
Conserve your ammo. Only shoot at what you can hit.
The convoy is going to come.
We're going to get home.
Loading!
Loading!
Randy, I need a pistol mag!
Loading!
Randy, last mag!
Gordy!
Fuck!
Gordy is gone, man. I'll be outside.
Good luck.
We need the 10th Mountain in there. Everything they got.
Pakistanis, Malays, I want their tanks and APCs.
They don't know we've gone in.
We have stirred up a hornet's nest here. We're fighting the entire city.
I want every vehicle possible that's got four wheels and armor.
Get everything.
Once they've assembled, we'll move our men out of the hostile area...
...and back to the Pakistani Stadium, the safe zone.
-Now, let's go. -Roger that.
On your knees! Get down! Get down!
Stay with me. You just got a bullet in the leg.
See where those tires are burning? All that black smoke?
Roger. I can see it, but I can't get there. Over.
Go 100 meters past it. That's the crash.
Negative. You don't understand.
Negative. You don't understand. It's roadblock after roadblock. You have to find us another route. Over.
It's roadblock after roadblock. You have to find us another route. Over.
There ain't one. The only other route is all the way around the city.
-Roger that. -Kilo 64, this is Kilo 11.
Request permission to move to crash site number two on foot. Over.
Green light, Kilo 11. Stop the vehicle. Let me out.
Stop the vehicle. Let me out.
After I'm finished with this, I'll whip you boys up some margaritas.
The usual. Blended, no salt.
This is Kilo 12. We've got to change our position. Over.
Eversmann, come in.
Eversmann.
-Roger, who is this? -Sanderson.
Do not-- I say again, do not fire to the east. We are coming to you.
Understood.
DiTomasso and his men are on the southeast corner.
We need you on the northeast building.
Roger. We'll take it.
Watch out for skinnies. They're on the rooftops.
They're in prayer but not for much longer.
Hold your fire to the east.
Eversmann? It's Yurek.
I got Nelson and Twombly with me.
We got the chopper in sight. Where are you?
On the southwest corner. Where have you been? Are you okay?
Yeah.
Hold your fire. We're coming in.
We got to go.
Shawn, listen! Sergeant Yurek's going to run first.
When he gets across the street, he'll turn around and cover you as you run.
Listen closely. When you get there, you'll turn around and cover me, okay?
You won't just run to Eversmann's position.
You're going to stop and you are going to cover me.
It's important you understand that.
Okay, you ready?
Yeah, I guess.
-Don't forget. -What?
Don't forget.
I got them in my sight, sergeant. They're coming up on the west gate.
I see them.
Let's move out.
Can you cover us, sergeant?
We got you.
Nelson!
Fuck!
Twombly!
Smith! No!
You all right?
Get it off of me!
Get it off!
Come on, man. Come on.
Doc! Need some help with Smith here!
My leg! My leg!
Come on, Jamie, I got you!
Up, one, two, three.
-You're all right. -I need pressure on this wound.
My right thigh! Pressure, yeah.
-Are my balls okay? -You still have your balls.
-Are my balls okay? -You still have your balls. I need more men in here.
Twombly! Nelson!
-Put him down. -Oh, man, that really....
-It really hurts! -Direct pressure on that.
It's okay, it's okay.
-Let me see it! -All right.
All right, let me get a look at that.
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck! -What the fuck was that? -It's all right.
-What the fuck was that? -It's all right.
Hold that down. I need a medivac now.
Fuck. Galentine!
It's all right. Galentine! Get me Captain Steele!
-Sergeant Ruiz, how you doing? -Juliet 64, come in. Over.
They're not going to come and get us. They're not going to come for us.
I need you to suck it up, sergeant. I need you to focus.
-Can you do that? -Juliet 64, come in. Over.
Now, can you hold your weapon?
Yes, sir. Anybody comes through that door gets two in the chest and one in the head.
Anybody comes through that door gets two in the chest and one in the head.
-You understand? -I'm still in the fight, sir.
Captain Steele, I need a medivac in here now!
-Corporal Smith has been hit! -Hold on, 25.
Still in the fight.
He's hurt pretty bad. 25, we got wounded too. You'll have to maintain your situation, over.
25, we got wounded too. You'll have to maintain your situation, over.
If he doesn't get help in a half-hour, he's in trouble!
C-2, this is 64.
Requesting a medivac for a critically wounded...
...at Chalk Four's location. Over.
Command, Chalk Four is requesting medivac.
Can't risk it. It's still too hot.
Captain, we cannot send in medivac at this time. Sit tight. Over.
25, this is 64. Negative on the medivac. It's not possible.
JOC cannot risk another bird. You'll just have to hold on.
All right. I got him.
I want direct pressure on the wound.
It's going to be all right.
This is Kilo 11. I'm at the Durant crash site.
Roger that.
Crash site two secured.
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.
Cribbs?
-They're still debating the route. -How long?
At least a couple of hours.
We haven't got that long, Joe.
Pakistani general says, since we didn't deign to inform him of the raid...
...it'll take some time to mobilize the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.
You tell the general this:
I understand, but it is my duty to remind him... ...that my men are surrounded by thousands of armed Somali militia.
...that my men are surrounded by thousands of armed Somali militia.
It's imperative that we move them out of the hostile area...
...and into the safe zone.
I need his help now.
Yes, sir.
Durant.
Michael Durant.
Yes.
You are the Ranger who kills my people?
I'm not a Ranger. I'm a pilot.
That's right.
None of you Americans smoke anymore.
You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives.
What do you want with me?
You have taken hostages.
We have you.
My government will never negotiate for me.
Then perhaps you and I can negotiate, huh?
Soldier to soldier.
I'm not in charge.
Course not. You have the power to kill, but not negotiate.
In Somalia, killing is negotiation.
Do you really think if you get General Aidid...
...we will simply put down our weapons...
...and adopt American democracy?
That the killing will stop?
We know this: Without victory, there can be no peace.
There will always be killing, you see?
This is how things are in our world.
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.
You got to take over from me. Both hands.
It's the femoral artery, but I can't see it.
Which means that it's retracted up into the pelvis.
I have to find it and clamp it. It's the only way to stop the bleeding.
I have to find it and clamp it. It's the only way to stop the bleeding. I got no more IVs.
So I'm going to need you to assist. Okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Now listen, Jamie. I got to do something, it's going to hurt.
Okay? I got to cause you more pain, but I have to do it to help you.
All right, you understand? -Morphine. -I can't.
It'll lower your heart rate too far. I'm sorry.
Twombly, why don't you take his hands?
Hold the wound open, keep pressure on the top of the leg.
Yurek, take the feet and a flashlight.
On my count.
All right, Jamie. All right.
One. Two.
Three.
Wait, wait. Okay. I feel it.
I feel the pulse.
I got it. I got it. I got it, yeah. I got it.
-I got it. -You got it?
Clamp?
I got it clamped.
-Hold it. -Got it.
Here, grab it.
-It's tearing. -I got it.
-Doc, it's going back in! -Hold it! It's tearing!
-Okay. Get out. Hold the wound. -Okay, I'm holding.
Move your hand.
What?
Fix it?
Yeah, yeah. We got it.
What the hell are you doing? It's all in the grind, sergeant. Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.
It's all in the grind, sergeant. Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.
Grimesy, you are squared away.
Sergeant, how would you like a nice hot cup of joe?
Gold Coast blend.
Sit down. I want to take a look at that foot.
-No, it's not a problem. -Come on.
-Where the hell did they find you? -Behind a desk.
No, really. What, you think I'm kidding?
-Is anybody hit? -We're good!
-You all right? -Yeah!
-Is everybody all right? -Yeah!
Incoming!
-DiTomasso's hit! -Pull him out!
Ranger here. This is Kilo 11.
Chalk Four. We're at the southeast corner of the crash. Who's this?
This is Hoot. I'm coming with three friendlies. I need cover fire. Over.
Roger, Kilo 11. Hold your fire! Deltas coming in.
Roger, Kilo 11. Hold your fire! Deltas coming in. Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
Ground personnel will have to mark target positions with infrared strobes.
Get Little Birds on strafing runs and keep them going all night long.
If we don't hold back this city...
...we'll have a 100 caskets to fill by morning.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Harrell, ground personnel at crash site one...
...will have to mark the target with infrared strobes to prep for air strike.
McKnight.
Between the 10th Mountain and U.N., we got enough personnel, okay?
Danny, you guys do not have to go back out again.
I can't die here, man.
You're not going to die, all right? You're not going to die.
I'm sorry.
You don't have anything to be sorry for.
You saved Twombly. You did perfect.
You okay, Twombs?
Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie.
You did what you were trained to do.
You should be proud of that.
Be proud of that.
-Ev? -Yeah.
Do me a favor.
Yeah?
You tell my parents that I fought well today.
And that I fought hard.
You're going to tell them yourself, okay?
Do you hear me?
All right?
-Are the humvees here? -They're coming, Jamie.
They're coming.
You just got to hang in there a little bit. -You hold on for just a little bit. -I can.
-You hold on for just a little bit. -I can. I can.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
-It's nothing. -It's nothing.
Nothing.
Oh, shit.
Hold the wound.
Doc.
Doc.
It's okay.
What are you doing?
We need the ammo.
You did all you could here.
They should've sent a medivac.
Right now we'd be out there defending another crashed chopper.
More men would get torn up.
Maybe.
See, you're thinking. Don't.
Because, sergeant, you can't control who gets hit or who doesn't.
Who falls out of a chopper or why.
It ain't up to you. It's just war.
Yeah, well, Smith's still dead.
This all happened because Blackburn fell.
Should have, could have, don't matter.
You'll get plenty of time to think about all that later. Believe me.
Sergeant, you got your men this far.
You did it right today.
You need to start thinking about getting these men out of here.
Well, shall we?
I need four guys in this corner now!
RPG!
This is Barber 52 in position for gun run.
Jesus Christ. Look at that.
This is 25! I can see you. You're right above me.
Eversmann, I can't tell who's who down there. Too much activity.
I'll mark the target with a strobe! Over.
Roger that.
You see it?
No, I can't see shit.
-I'm putting it on the roof. -You're going to need help!
Cover me.
Okay, guys, we're going to lay down some cover fire for him on three!
Ready? One. Two. Three. Go!
Two. Three. Go!
I got your position. I got the target. We're inbound and hot.
C-2, miniguns dry. Request permission to return to base. Rearm. Over.
Roger that. Second team inbound. Your station.
On your location, four minutes.
All right, they're here. Get the wounded ready to move.
Lay down some cover fire!
I thought I heard a noise out here!
-Load up. We're getting out of here. -Yes, sir.
25, this is 64. The rescue column's here...
...and will be with you in about five minutes.
Prepare your men for exfil.
Yeah, roger that, sir! Roger that!
Five minutes! The convoy is going to be here in five minutes!
I need a mag! Eversmann, I'm out!
My last one!
The convoy is here!
Sergeant Eversmann. I heard you guys needed a lift!
Yes, sir!
Bring your wounded and start loading them up!
Hey, I got you. I got you.
It's okay. I want to walk.
Yeah, I would too. Let's go!
We get the pilots' bodies out, and then we go to the stadium.
We're running out of room around here.
Cram into every possible space.
Okay, 10th Mountain provides security for armor...
...walks us out of the hot zone.
10th Mountain? No.
Sir, with respect, my Rangers can provide rear security.
We'll walk you out of the hot zone... ...then we'll jump on the last few vehicles.
-Okay, let's get out of here. -Let's go.
-All right, you got him? -Yeah, come on.
Come on!
These things are fucking bullet magnets. Come on, let's go!
We go when I'm ordered to, soldier.
Careful.
Easy. Go easy.
Easy.
Colonel, what is going on down there?
They're dismantling the entire cockpit around the body.
How long is it going to take? I need an honest, no-shit assessment.
They can't say!
Danny...
...no one gets left behind.
You understand me, son?
Yes, general.
Do what you have to do.
Roger.
-Come on. Bring him through. -I got him.
-Get all his gear. Get the wounded out. -Got you, sir!
-Move! -Got you!
Move out! Move out! Let's go!
Fuck!
Fire in the hole!
-Let's go! Move! -Let's go!
-Open the hatch! We got men back here! -No room here! Go on the roof!
-What's going on? -The roof?
I'm not getting on no fucking roof!
-Sir-- -No, no, it's full.
We're running out. Keep moving. Use the vehicles as cover.
Move it! Let's go!
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.
-Move! -Go! Move!
Go!
Get down! Get down!
Get down, lady!
I'm out of ammo!
Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!
Don't you do it.
-What are you doing? -Don't you damn do it.
Kurth, let's go!
Easy.
Shit.
Bullet missed your jugular by about three millimeters. Don't move.
Hurry up, hurry up.
Grimes?
Little short on coffee, but I got you some tea.
How you doing, soldier?
Can't feel a thing.
Take his pulse.
Ruiz.
Hey, sergeant. Hey.
-Captain. -Lorenzo. How you doing?
It went in and out, so the medic said I should be okay in a couple of days.
That's great news.
Are we going after them?
You bet your ass we will. We got to regroup.
Don't go out there without me.
Don't go back out there without me.
I can still do my job.
You get some rest now, okay?
You're going back in?
There are still men out there.
Goddamn.
When I go home...
...and people ask me: "Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?
"Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?
Why? You some kind of war junkie?"
I won't say a goddamn word.
Why? They won't understand.
They won't understand why we do it.
They won't understand it's about the men next to you.
And that's it.
That's all it is.
Hey. Don't even think about it, all right? I'm better on my own.
Don't even think about it, all right? I'm better on my own.
Hey. We started a whole new week. It's Monday.
I was talking to Blackburn the other day... ...and he asked me, "What changed? Why are we going home?"
...and he asked me, "What changed? Why are we going home?"
And I said, "Nothing."
But that's not true, you know. I think everything's changed.
I know I've changed.
A friend of mine asked me before I got here....
It was when we were all shipping out.
He asked me:
"Why are you going to fight somebody else's war?
What, do y'all think you're heroes?"
I didn't know what to say at the time...
...but if he asked me again, I'd say no.
I'd say there's no way in hell.
Nobody asks to be a hero.
It just sometimes turns out that way.
I'll talk to your ma and pa when I get home, okay?
My love, you are strong and you will do well in life.
I love you and my children deeply.
Today and tomorrow, let each day grow and grow.
Keep smiling and never give up, even when things get you down.
So, in closing, my love...
...tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.
[girl 2] Here it is.
[girl 3] Kit, I've got the shovel.
[Kit] You do?
-[girl 3] Lucy, get the box. -[Lucy] Okay.
What are you putting in?
[girl 3] It's supposed to be a secret.
[girl 3] My dad thinks I'm at your house.
[Kit] My mom thinks I'm at yours.
-[Lucy] Let's dig deep. -[girl 3] Okay.
[Lucy] So no one will find it.
[Kit] Dig it deeper.
[Lucy] Shh. We don't wanna get caught.
[girl 3] I want some dirt.
[Lucy] When we were ten, growing up in Georgia,
Mimi, Kit, and I knew exactly what we wanted out of life.
-[Kit] Lucy, get the box. -[Mimi] This is fun.
[Lucy] So, we put our dreams in a box,
and we buried it.
[Kit] We have to keep it dry.
[Lucy] We made a pact to dig it up at midnight
the day of our high school graduation.
[Lucy] Pack it down.
[Mimi] Let's be best friends forever.
We will.
[Lucy] Now, I don't even remember what our wishes were,
except for one.
We wished that we'd be best friends forever.
Well, that wish didn't come true.

You ran into me, Kit.
What, you're too perfect to bump into anybody?

Well, voice classes would make nice electives. Not much time for that.
Looking at double major in biology and chemistry
if she wants to get into the best med school, huh?
-Yeah. -So…
Henry, come on, I'll show you how to start that truck for tonight.
-All right. I'll see you later. -Okay, bye.
-Bye, Mrs. J. -Good luck, Henry.
I'm all he's got, you know?
Well, congratulations, Lucy.
Thank you. Thanks.
Here it is.
Honey, what's wrong?
I'm fine. [sniffles]
Pop, I worked really hard
to be the valedictorian.
Of course you did.
Why didn't it feel like anything?
What do you mean you didn't feel anything? It felt great.
[sighs] Pop, I never went to one football game. Well, you don't like football.
But you're supposed to go, and it's supposed to be fun.
And like all the parties at Hemmings Field and stuff…
I never went to any of 'em.
I never stayed out late.
I never just… hung out.
That's 'cause you had a head on your shoulders. You stayed home and you studied.
Pop, here's just a lot of things that I wanted to do that I didn't.
And I was up there getting my diploma, and I was like…
"Is this it?"
Come on, now. Didn't we both work hard for this?
[sniffs] You're right.
I guess it's just the pressure of graduation and all.
You're right.
[girl] Hi!
Girl, hi!
Oh, my God!
Lucy.
Mimi, not now, okay?
Are you coming or not?
-Coming where? -It's graduation night.
Oh, God. Hemmings Field. I totally forgot.
So, are you coming or not?
[Henry] Hey!
-Hey. -Got it!
I have plans.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
-Are you okay? -[Henry] I'm okay.
Do you want something?
Yeah. Are you coming at midnight or what?
-Excuse me? -Kit, we made a pact, remember?
Oh, you're not serious!
Well, look, you can really go without me.
I have better things to do than dig up some old box.

Guitar guy is such a hottie.
That's Ben Kimble.
Yeah, I heard he just got out of jail. Killed a guy.
I don't believe you!
Yeah! Everybody is talking about it.
Oh, too bad!
Well, if anyone could have him, it'd be you.
But I'm off the market, remember?
Oh, please.
Dylan's at UCLA doing…

That's not true.
Okay.
Whatever.
-[Lucy] Are you ready? -Yeah, just two seconds.
Okay, hold on.
[Lucy] Henry, are you ready?
I'm ready.
That's okay. Go on.
♪ Let's love, baby ♪ Okay.
Why are you stopping?
Henry, this isn't how I hoped it would be.
That's weird 'cause this is exactly how I hoped it would be
or pretty accurate.
Maybe if we get into bed. Oh! That's a good idea!
[sighs] Okay.
These are nice sheets.
Can I hear the list again?
-Oh, Luce, come on! -Please. Please.
Just… Just one more time.
Okay.
Thanks.
Reason number one: we've been lab partners -for three years. -Okay.
-So, we trust each other. -That's really important.
-So, we trust each other. -That's really important. Trust is very important.
Reason number two: we're both 18 and have never done it.
-Very important. -Okay.
Reason number three:
we both wanna do it.
Reason number four…
Please, Lucy, come on, please.
I'm… I'm begging you, please.
-Let's just do it, please. -Okay. Okay. Okay.
-Yeah? -Yeah, we can do it.
Okay, so let's…
-I'll go this way. -Okay. I'm going this way.
-Okay. -Let's do this.
-Okay. -Okay.
Please don't laugh. You're killing this.
No! Don't you want your first time to be special?
Yeah, but this is special!
Listen, do you wanna spend the rest of your life
knowing you did it for the first time with your lab partner?
Yes. Yes, I do. And I'll tell you why.
Because do you know what it's like for a guy to go to college a virgin?
-Henry… -No, I'm telling you, they--
They're ostracized! They treat them like lepers!
I'm sorry.
What's up, Mimi? How's the fetus?
Drop dead.
Look, is it mine or what?
I can't even believe I went out with you!
I'm trying to do the right thing here.
Oh, yeah? What's the right thing?
Ignoring me for the past five months?
Letting your stupid friends call me a ho? Spreading rumors about me?
I'm only repeating what I heard.
What I heard is you let some guy do you in the back seat of his car
over Christmas break!
Jerk.
It's ten paces on the other side.
What are you doing here?
Where's Lucy?
She's not coming.
You have a flashlight? Good.
Gimme back my flashlight!
Give me back my flashlight.
Let's just get this over with, okay?
[Kit] God. I don't even remember what we put in here.
Me either.
Here, hold this for a second, Lucy. Wow.
[gasps] My bridal Barbie!
She was my wish.
Looks like you're getting your wish. I know.
[Mimi] Lucy, I think this is yours.
-My locket. -What did you wish for?
I wanted to find my mom, to see her again.
[Kit] Did you ever find her?
No. She lives in Arizona, and my pop…
[scoffs] He doesn't think it's a good idea. So…
What did you wish for?
[laughs] A key chain?
No. The world.
That I was gonna get out of this crappy town,
go all the way to California,
put my feet in the Pacific Ocean.
There's a wish that's not coming true for a while.
A lot you know, Kit.
What's that supposed to mean?
[Kit] Slide Records' recording contest?
-So? -So I'm going on Sunday.
You're going to California to audition for a record company?
-Yeah. -You're pregnant.
So? I'll wear something slimming.
[Kit] And what? You think you're gonna become like this big fat pregnant star?
I have a pretty good voice.
-How are you gonna get there? -I found a ride with this guy.
What? No, Mimi, that is crazy.
You can't go all the way to Los Angeles by yourself with some guy.
So, then, come with me.
I'll sing lead, and you guys can sing backups.
I don't think we should do that.
It's stupid is what it is. Okay, fine.
You know what? Now you can just forget all your past!
[Lucy] Oh, wow.
Oh, my goodness.
Let me see. Look at us.
-[Kit] I was so chubby. -[giggles]
Singing. Aw…
I gotta go. I have to go meet my friends.
Yeah, it's getting late.
Yeah.
[Mimi] Hey, you guys, um…
I'm leaving Sunday at 7 a.m. if you all wanna come.
[Kit] What do you mean you're not coming home for the summer?
Dylan, listen to me. You have to come home.
Because!
I haven't seen you since Christmas!
-Don't you miss me? -Excuse me.
Dad! Customer!
Dylan, we have to plan the wedding.
-[clears throat] -[Kit] All right.
I love you.
Dylan?
[Lucy] Hi, Jamie.
-Hey, darling. -Hey, Pop.
Dr. Johnson called today.
Good news.
Got me a job at the hospital?
All those discounts I gave him finally paid off.
-[Lucy] Cool. -Yep.
Pop, can I ask you a question?
Mmm-hmm.
It's about Mother.
[sighs] Okay.
Has she ever tried to see me?
No, she hasn't.
I was thinking, maybe she's afraid to visit me.
Luce, we've talked about this.
Do not feel guilt about your mother leaving.
-But what if-- -Baby.
This is not about us.
She was the one who walked out on a three-year-old.
She's the one that should feel guilty.
All right?
All right.
Nobody brings four suitcases on a road trip.
Look, Dylan asked me to go see him in LA,
and I can't get there looking like a skank.
You better hope it all fits. It will, okay?
[Lucy] Hey.
-Oh. -Hey.
I'm not going to the audition.
You can drop me off in Arizona.
-Fine. -Fine.
-Fine. Shotgun. -[Mimi] Right! I'm sitting up front!
What's your problem?
You must be Lucy.
Yeah.
So, you're taking us to LA?
Uh, yeah. I'll get your bag.
-[Lucy exclaims] -You okay?
-I'm fine. -[chuckles] All right, sorry.
Move it, Ben! Let's go already! I'll get the door for you.
[whispers] Hey. Who's the guy?
[whispers] Oh, that's just Ben. He's really cool.
[Ben] Let's hit it!
[Lucy] Where's the bathroom?
[gas station attendant] Second door. There's no soap.
So, what's the deal with Lucy?
What? Are you hot for her?
[hesitates] No.
I wouldn't even try, Ben.
Seriously, she's not like us.
She's way out of your league.
[Lucy] Ew!
Want a chip?
Get out of here.
-[changes to pop station] -What are you doing?
-What's with this music? -Well, I like it.
Can we listen to something else for ten minutes?
No.
Come on, Ben, please. Be a nice guy.
Okay, five minutes. Just five minutes.
[Kit] Thank you.

Why did we stop?
-I'm tired. -So let someone else drive.
No, nobody drives the Cruiser but me.
Okay, whatever.
Where are we gonna sleep?
There's a field there.
I got a tent and sleeping bags in the trunk.
[Kit] A field?
A field?
-No, I don't sleep in a field. -[Ben sighs]
I saw a sign for a Hilton back there.
How much money do we have?
[Mimi] I can't believe you only brought $40.
Well, I have expenses.
I had to have my homecoming dress custom-made.
I was voted queen, you know?
Oh, my dream come true.
Did anybody make a plan?
What do you mean?
Like how many miles you're gonna drive in a day?
Which towns you're gonna stop in?
How much gas money you're gonna need?
Okay.
We have $486, right?
Which means, for food…
gas…
-Okay… -Is it enough?
It's gonna be tight.
Oh, my gosh.
It's a love room. [chuckles]
-[Ben] Oh, man! -[Mimi] Look at the walls!
I'm not sleeping here.
-This is what we can afford. -What is this, run by the hour?
-I'm not sleeping here. -Where are you gonna sleep?
[Kit] I don't know. This place is disgusting.
-I'll take this bed. -[Mimi] All right.
So, how come you're going to LA?
My uncle might have a job for me there, so…
I'm gonna go down check it out for a couple of weeks, and if I like it,
I'll move there.
What about your band? Don't you have a band?
Oh, no. I was just filling in the other night. I don't have a band.
Mimi said she didn't think you'd come with us on the trip.
Neither did I.
You sorry you did?
Not so far.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Hey!
It's freaking cold!
-We're in here. -[Lucy] I'm in here.
I just need to brush my teeth.
-What are you doing? -You're so touchy.
Mimi!
-Mimi. -[Mimi] Huh?
[Kit] How do you know Ben?
Just from around.
God, he's so cute.
Don't you think he's cute?
He's all right.
I just can't believe he was in jail.
What?
Yeah, he like, killed a guy.
-Kit. -What?
-That's what I heard. -Excuse me?
He killed somebody?
No, he did not kill anybody.
I don't think.
Mimi.
Okay, he had a car. He was coming to LA. Just don't be upset.
I'm on a road trip with a killer and you're telling me not to be upset?
[whispering] He'll hear you.
Oh, my God.
Hey, what's up?
Mimi, do you know him at all?
He used to hang out with some of the guys at the trailer park.
[Mimi] So, he may have killed someone, okay?
So what? He did his time. He paid his debt to society.
Oh, my God.
[Ben] Hey.
You all ready to go?
Yeah.
[Ben] Hey… you wanna ride up front with me today?
No, that's okay. The backseat's fine. It's okay.
-I'm gonna go check us out, okay? -Yeah.
♪ How I could just kill a man… ♪
-I'll be right back. -I'll come with you.
No, it's okay, I'm fine.
Hey, Luce, will you please get me some chips?
No, Mimi.
Open the door.
I'll get my own chips.
Y'all! Wait for me!
So, when he came home last Christmas, he proposed.
He's coming home as soon as he's done with school next spring.
[chuckles] You're seriously gonna marry that loser?
You don't even know him.
-Ow. -What's wrong?
Nothing. It just kicked, is all.
-[Lucy] Can I feel it? -If you want.
[giggles] It just kicked again.
What about Kurt?
What about Kurt?
Well, he's the father, isn't he?
Yes, Kurt's the father.
But it wasn't working out, so I dumped him.
You're gonna raise this baby all by yourself?
Y'all, I'm gonna go wait in the car with Ben.
That's so typical of her. She's not even thinking about her future.
How is she gonna get by with a baby?
Well, she brought this upon herself.
-Kit. -What?
Hello?
-Hi, Pop. -Lucy.
Sneaking away in the middle of the night?
I'm very upset with you.
Dr. Johnson went to a great deal of trouble
-to get you that job at the hospital. -I'm sorry, okay?
Sorry? You are coming back now!
Sorry? You are coming back now! And you will regard that as a command.
You're usually so levelheaded,
and you pull a stunt like this? I'm so surprised at you, girl.
You worked so hard. You're gonna start slacking off now?
Lucy!
Lucy?
What are you writing there?
Stuff.
Hey.
Are you mad at me or something?
Why would I be mad at you? I don't even know you.
Oh, man!
-No, God! -[Mimi] Oh, no.
It sounds bad.
Look at all that smoke.
-Ow! -Ah!
What's wrong with it, Ben?
Well… [sighs] It's the head gasket, I think.
-Give me your shirt. -Here.
[Ben] Whoa! What are you doing?
Nobody touches this except specialists and myself.
Because it's an antique and I don't want people to…
It's your radiator.
No, it's the head gasket.
[Lucy] No. Your radiator is cracked.
-Hey come on! -[Lucy] What year is this? '73.
Ugh, it's like $350, plus labor.
Great. Great.
I'm hungry.
All right, how long does it take to get a tow truck?
Ben's only been gone for two hours, y'all.
I'm so hungry.
Will you stop saying that?
We heard you. You're hungry.
So what?
We don't have $350.
And even if he gets a tow truck,
we don't have enough money to get the car fixed.
I'm gonna be stuck here in--
Where the hell am I? Where am I?
Louisiana.
Stuck in some butthole town, Louisiana.
I am never gonna get to LA to see Dylan.
He's gonna be so upset.
[scoffs] Whatever.
-Excuse me? -Could you be more self-centered?
You're just jealous.
-What? -I'm not blind, you know?
I know how girls like you looked at me in school.
You would have given anything to trade places with me.
Girls like me?
I can't help it if I'm popular, so just lay off.
Girls like me?
I don't make the rules, Mimi.
It's not my fault everyone thinks you're a trailer-trash skeeze.
-Stop it! -[Kit] Don't touch me like that!
Guys, don't!
-[Kit] You're pregnant! -I don't care!
-[yelling] -You're a redneck!
-Girls! -[yelling]
-Mimi, stop! -[yelling]
-[yelling] -Stop it!
Stop!
I'm so sick of the two of you!
Bitching and fighting every damn second of the day!
For once, would you just shut up?
I don't know why I asked the two of you to come on this trip.
We don't belong together.
Well, this was a mistake, okay?
[mechanic] I'm sorry, partner. That's the best I can do.
It's a cracked radiator. [sighs]
He said he'd get it ready by tomorrow.
How are we gonna get the money to pay?
I have an idea.
I'm gonna call my father and have him come get me.
You're leaving?
This trip's over.
[Mimi] Lucy, wait! I have an idea!
You know what? I'm sick of your ideas, Mimi.
I should have known you'd make a mess of this trip.
If you wanna run home to your daddy, that's fine,
but don't even try and blame this on me.
Lucy…
I haven't asked you for anything in a really long time,
-but I'm gonna ask you to stay. -[phone rings]
Please, hang up the damn phone and just stay with us!
[Kit] Come on, Lucy.
-[Pete] Hello? -[phone hangs up]
I do. I have a really good idea.
Yeah? It better be good.
[man] Karaoke tonight!
[man] Karaoke!
Okay, I have something to say.
I know we're not all getting along right now, but tonight's really important.
We really need the money.
So, could we just be civil and get through this? Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
[Mimi] All right!
Y'all ready?
Yeah.
-That's cute. -[Mimi] Thank you.
Ah, wait.
-It's all the tips we can get, right? -Mmm-hmm.
So, if we wanna put on a show, we have to be sexy.
Now you're talkin'.
-Whatcha got? -[Kit] All right.
[Lucy] Let me wear those feathers.
[host] All right. Next contestant's a brand-new act.
And for all you tourists that don't know the rules in my club,
here it is, plain and simple.
You're the judge. If you hate 'em, tell 'em.
If you like 'em, pay 'em.
We got some baskets going around. Put the money in there.
Be loud, be fair, and be generous if you like what you hear.
Come on, give 'em a warm welcome!
-[woman] They look young. -[man] It's past their bedtime.
[man] Look at her, she's pregnant.

I'm not mad at you for what happened back there, okay?
[Mimi yells excitedly] There's bathrobes!
-[Lucy] Where are you going? -Just going out.

-[Mimi] No, thank you. -[Lucy] Me, please.
-[Kit] Madame. -Madame.
-Oh! [chuckles] -[Kit] Go, Lucy!
Go, Lucy!
What are you doing?
-[Mimi shouts] -[Kit] You go, girl!
I have seen one, y'all.
Yeah, but have you touched one?
[Mimi] She has!
-[Kit laughs] -[Mimi] Details!
It's always the quiet ones.
Say it loud! Say you touched one and you're proud!
Lucy touched one! She did!
[Lucy] Okay, the best thing that ever happened to you.
[Kit] That's easy.
What?
Reaching my goal weight.
Third year at fat camp, the summer before eighth grade.
Wait… That camp you went to every summer was a fat camp?
Yes. And I loved it.
For two months,
my mama wasn't around to pick on me for being fat.
Being fat is just unacceptable to her.
Okay.
The worst thing that ever happened to you.
That's even easier.
Reaching my goal weight. -But you just said-- -It turns out that…
-But you just said-- -It turns out that… being prettier than my mama
is even more unacceptable.
-Wow. -Oh, Jesus.
Yep.
[Lucy] One morning, I woke up and she was gone.
Pop really wouldn't say anything about it.
I thought she was coming back, and Pop told me she wasn't.
They fought all the time.
You know, I think that
she just got fed up and took off without even thinking.
And, after a while, it was just too late to come back.
I know she wants to see me.
She's just scared, that's all.
I'm gonna be so sick later. [chuckles]
Mimi, be glad you're pregnant and you couldn't act stupid with us.
[Mimi] That's not why I don't drink.
I just don't see the point in it.
So, you never partied?
Once.
Over Christmas.
There was one of those parties down at Hemmings Field.
And this guy was drinking his beer,
and I remember…
it was in a blue bottle.
And I was real mad at Kurt, because…
he blew me off again to hang out with his friends.
So, I had a few beers.
I had more than a few.
This guy, you know, he seemed…
he seemed real nice
'cause when I couldn't walk, he offered to drive me home.
[Lucy] Mimi.
It's no big deal, Luce. It happens to girls all the time.
[Lucy] Did you go to the police?
[sniffles] No.
I'm from a trailer park. I got drunk and I got in his car.
So, Kurt's not the father?
I saw this ad in a magazine.
So, I called up this lawyer out in Atlanta, and she sent me all this stuff, you know?
out in Atlanta, and she sent me all this stuff, you know?
All these pictures and letters of all these people who want babies.
I was supposed to pick one.
What was his name?
I don't know.
Why did we stop being friends?
I don't know. People drift apart.
Well, promise me we won't drift apart again.
[Mimi] Come here.
And where have you been all night?
Thank you.
For what you did last night, I mean.
Thanks.
[Lucy] Scoot over.
I'm never drinking again.
This burrito is so good.
Please, don't mention food.
What are you doing?
-Chilling. -[Lucy chuckles]
Wake him up!
Y'all, he's been driving all day.
[Mimi] We can't just stay here.
We should just let him sleep, you think?
-Uh-uh. -[Mimi] Fine, yeah, we'll let him sleep.
Lucy, get his keys.
He told us we couldn't drive his car. I can't do that.
Why not? It's not like we're gonna drive over a cliff or anything.
And it's stupid to stay here.
[Mimi] I'll drive.
-Just get his keys. -[Kit] Yeah, get his keys.
Why do I have to get his keys?
Because Kit and I voted and you lost.
-Lucy, get the keys. -Yeah, Lucy, get the keys.
-[Mimi chuckles] -Okay.
This is stealing, you know?
It's not stealing if he's in the car with us.
No, it's kidnapping.
Okay, stop.
Okay.
I got it.
Okay, go.
Mimi.
Mimi!
You failed driver's ed, didn't you?
-Maybe. -[Lucy and Kit laugh]
Move over!
-Oh, God. -Guys.
-Smile for the camera! -[camera clicks]
Turn it on!

Hi! Did you have a good nap?
Eh… Stop, stop the car.
Oh, don't be mad! You looked so sweet when you were sleeping.
-We just didn't wanna wake you. -Stop the car.
It's against the law to park on the shoulder.
It's my car!
We're almost at an exit.
[thumps] Stop the damn car!
-Mimi, go talk to him. -Uh-uh. You go talk to him.
-What? -Nobody is gonna go talk to him.
I know he's mad.
And he has killed before.
Mimi. You said he didn't kill anyone.
-I said I thought he didn't kill anyone. -Oh, my God.
-It's okay. I'll go. -I'm sorry.
[Kit] Be careful, Lucy.
-[Ben groans] -We're sorry.
I've been in a car full of chicks for days.
Do you have any idea what it's like being surrounded by girls all the time?
Okay… [huffs]
Being a girl yourself, yeah. I know, stupid question. Geez!
[screams] But I'm a guy, okay?
I'm a guy. Just a guy, and--
I'm a guy. Just a guy, and-- I have been listening to nothing but girl talk
and watching you all do your girl things for days.
And I'm not complaining because I'm outnumbered, but…
that's my car.
It's my car and it's just--
It's the one thing that hasn't been taken over by chicks.
-Okay? -Okay.
[Ben] Okay.
Ben.
Yeah?
Were you really in jail?
Yeah, I was.
-So, you killed a guy? -[Ben] What?
Who said I killed a guy?
Everybody back home.
Oh, man.
I didn't kill a guy.
What did you do, then?
I was in college, and I get this call from my stepsister.
She wants me to come home and get her because my stepdad is beating her up
pretty bad.
My mom can't stop him, so…
Yeah, I drive home in the middle of the night and uh…
she throws her things out the window and climbs out,
and then I drive her back to school with me.
-And you went to jail for that? -See, that's the thing.
There's this law
against driving a child that's not a relative across state lines,
and my stepdad, of course, pressed charges.
But, you know, it's okay. I only got six months,
But, you know, it's okay. I only got six months, and then I had to stay in Ohio for a year's probation.
And my sister got to go live with her mom.
You all really thought I killed a guy?
[chuckles] Yeah.
What in the hell were you thinking
getting into a car with a homicidal maniac?
Huh?
Man…
[Mimi] Why are we stopping?
[Ben] You'll see.
-Mimi, you okay? -Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
Look.
[Mimi] Wow.
It's like you have to whisper.
Hello!
-Hello! -Hello!
Hello!
Oh, man, we gotta make time. The next hotel is still an hour away.
Well, Ben, do you have enough sleeping bags for all of us?
Are you serious?
Y'all… You really wanna camp here?
-Yeah. -Yeah.
It sounds like fun.
[Mimi] Okay, now you gotta keep your thumb on the outside like this.
-Right, now, the trick is… -[harmonica playing]
…you don't want to let him know that you're gonna hit him.
Okay? Maybe, like, look away first.
[chuckles] And then, when he least expects it, -throw your whole body into it, okay? -Okay.
[Mimi] Okay.
Mimi, what are you doing to her?
I'm teaching her how to fight,
because every girl should know how to throw a punch.
-[sighs] Oh! -That was decent.
I'm gonna go to bed. Thank you.
I'm gonna go to the ladies room. Where is it again?
-Third bush after the rock over there. -Okay.
-This one? -That one, yeah.
Okay, what are you always writing in there?
Poems, mostly.
Can I hear one?
Okay, one.
But you can't laugh.
Okay.
"I used to think I had the answers to everything,
but now I know that life doesn't always go my way."
"It feels like I'm caught in the middle, and that's when I realize
that I'm not a girl.
and not yet a woman."
"All I need is time,
just a moment that's mine."
"And while I'm in between, I'm not a girl."
I liked it.
-Really? -Yeah, really, I liked it.
-What? -That is… Well…
-You got ash on your face. -Where?
I'll get it.
There.
-What's wrong? -What happened?
-Y'all, something bit my ass. -What is it?
-Come on, let me see. -[Lucy] Let me see.
-[Mimi] It's a snake bite. -No, Mimi, that's a mosquito bite.
[both] Ow!
-[Lucy] It's okay. -Mimi!
-Don't look! -How could I not?
-It's nothing, come on. -But it could've been a snake!
-[chuckles] Right. -All right!
We're out of here at dawn.
Nothing's biting my ass.
[Lucy] So, we'll be in Tucson today?
[Mimi] Around four, I think.
[Ben] Are you nervous?
Should I call her and tell her that I'm coming,
or should I just show up?
I should just show up, right? Surprise is always better.
She's gonna be real happy to see you.
[Lucy] I hope so.
Okay, so you're gonna call me and tell me everything about the audition, right?
You could still come with us.
Yeah, we're not leaving town until tomorrow.
-I'll be fine, okay? -[Mimi chuckles]
[Mimi] Well, you know where we're staying if you need us.
-Bye. -Bye.
-Bye. -[Mimi kisses]
Thanks. Yeah.
I guess this is it.
-Lucy, um… -What?
Good luck.
Thanks.
Can I help you?
It's me, Mama.
Lucy.
Come in.
You have a really nice house.
Thank you, Lucy.
Tucson seems like a really nice city.
It is.
Can I ask you why you're here, Lucy?
I wanted to see you.
And why was that, Lucy?
Well, you're my mother.
-Lucy… -Why do you keep saying my name like that?
Hold on a moment.
[Caroline] Hello?
Oh, sweetie, tell Joey's mommy
I said you could swim for another hour if you put on more sunscreen.
I don't want you to burn.
Daddy will pick you up at five.
I love you.
I have brothers?
Well, yes.
How old are they?
Ten and seven.
Do they know about me?
Lucy… I think we need to have a talk.
-Whoa. -[strumming guitar] Wait, seven, eight.
Six…
[Ben] Lucy.
Here.
-What happened? -[Kit] What's wrong?
-[Ben] Get towels, please. -[Mimi] Oh.
I'm fine.
[Mimi] Luce, you got to see your mom, right?
Yeah, I saw her.
What happened?
Hey.
[whispers] Hey.
Just thought you might want some dry clothes.
-Thanks. -Yeah.
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
I know.
Really, I'm okay.
What happened?
She said…
that she never wanted me.
She said that my father made her have me.
And that I was just a mistake.
I look like her, you know?
I have her eyes
and her hands.
It's her loss, Luce.
It's weird, though, you know?
I don't have a mother.
Well, you have us.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
Trying to call your dad?
I can't. I will in a minute.
Listen, you got that poem you read me?
-Yeah. -Can I see it?
Yeah, sure.
It's right here.
What are you doing?
Stop worrying so much. Come on, I made you something.
Okay.
This is my surprise?
Wouldn't it be sad if it was? Like if I just…
Wouldn't it be sad if it was? Like if I just… -totally sucked at cheering people up. -[Lucy laughs]
Nah, I…
I wrote some music for your poem.
Will you play it for me?
Will you sing?
Okay.
Just…
-Use this part as the chorus, okay? -Okay.
-[vocalizes] -Yeah. Like that?

Please leave a message.
Hi, Pop. I'm just calling to say that… I'm fine, okay?
And that you were right about Mama.
You were right.

-[Lucy] Whoa! -[Kit laughs] Stop it!
[Kit] It's too cold! It's freezing!
[Ben chuckles] Don't even! Don't!
-I can't believe we're finally here! -I know.
Ben, you know, there are a lot of colleges here in LA.
Yeah.
Hey, what if I didn't go back?
I could go to school here.
I mean…
Why don't I do something for me for once? You know?
I wanna stay.
I'm gonna stay.
Good.
Look how happy she is.
-Fill this out. -Okay, thanks.
Turn it in over there.
The audition is in six days.
Okay, wait. Where do we turn it in?
You turn it in over there.
-Fill this out… -[Mimi chuckles]
[Mimi] What are we going to do about music?
Um… Know what? I'm gonna get some flyers printed up.
I think I know a few guys in LA.
I'm gonna put a band together and see you back at the hotel.
-[Lucy] Okay. -[Mimi] Bye.
Hey, where you goin'?
[Ben] To put a band together!
Baby? Hi! It's me! Guess where I am.
LA!
Okay, all right. Then, I'll come to you.
All right. Then, how 'bout tonight?
Then, how 'bout tomorrow morning?
Dylan, I'm in Los Angeles!
I came to see you!
Fine.
What am I gonna say? Fine.
Me too.
He's really busy. Finals and all.
Yeah. We're fine.
So, who wants to go sightseeing?
-I do. -Okay, all right. Lucy?
I'm kind of tired.
Oh, Ben?
Yeah… I'm pretty beat.
Well, I need you! We can't drive your car, remember?
-[exclaims] -Don't wreck it. All right!
Wait, we're on Melrose…
I thought we were going to see the Hollywood sign!
[Kit] We will.
But I think it's back that way.
I know. But we're gonna make a stop first, okay?
Kit, you can see Dylan tomorrow.
Kit, come on, let's go back.
-No. -Kit, please.
-Let's go back! Please! -No!
I wanna see him now.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Kit, I really should wait in the car.
No, Mimi.
How do I look?
You look really great,
but, Kit, don't you think you guys might want to be alone together?
No.
I want you with me.
Come on.
-Surprise! -Hey.
-Uh… -Hi!
Oh, baby.
Kitty-Kat, I thought we were gonna make plans tomorrow.
Oh, I know. I just really wanted to see you.
This is my friend Mimi.
Mimi, hey.
Hey.
You two know each other?
Yeah, from… school. Right, Mimi?
-Right. -Yeah.
Well, aren't you gonna invite us in?
Yeah, I would, um… Kitty-Kat, but see, I've got this friend here and he's…
um… Kitty-Kat, but see, I've got this friend here and he's… he's really upset, and we're supposed to, like,
you know, hang out or whatever.
-Oh. -[girl] Do you need money for the pizza?
[Kit] Your friend sounds really upset.
Wait, Kit, hold on.
[girl] Who's she?
We're supposed to be getting married!
We're supposed to be getting married.
I was-- I was gonna tell you, I just-- You know?
I was-- I was gonna tell you, I just-- You know? Didn't want to do it over the phone.
Dylan, you gave me a ring.
You proposed and you gave me a ring!
Kit, I mean, I'm sorry, you know?
Oh, my God…
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! [sobs]
It was Dylan, wasn't it?
-I… -[Kit] It was you.
You were the guy at Christmas. Wasn't it? It was him, huh!
Babe, what are you talking about here? What is this?
That night when you came over, you had that rip in your shirt.
-That was the night that he-- -Kit, what-- What is your problem here?
-Kit, I have to go. -No, Mimi!
Come back here! Mimi, come back!
I want him to admit it.
-Admit it! -[Dylan] Hold on, all right?
You're getting yourself all worked up here over nothing, Kitty-Kat.
-My name is not Kitty-Kat. -[Mimi sighs]
-I'm not your pet! -[Dylan groans in pain]
Mimi!
Hello?
Excuse me, where's the phone at?
It's right over there.
Yeah, can I make a collect call, please?
Hey.
Hi.
They said I lost the baby.
"Lost" it.
Like it was my keys or something.
Isn't that the stupidest damn thing you've ever heard?
Yeah.
I'd decided to keep her.
I was standing on the beach,
and my toes were in the--
in the Pacific Ocean.
And she kicked.
It was like this sign.
Don't touch me, Luce. I'm already crying.
Okay.
I would have made a good mom.
Yeah.
[Pete] Just what were you thinking, running away with a pregnant girl?
Lucy, I'm waiting for an answer.
Do you know what it took to come here?
I had to take cash out of the savings for a plane fare and hotel.
You know how hard I worked
to earn that money for your college education.
I'm sorry.
[sighs] So, you made a mistake.
I understand.
Everybody makes mistakes.
You're forgiven.
I'm just gonna take you girls back to where you belong,
and forget about this whole crazy thing, all right?
[whispers] Okay.
Who's that boy you were with?
How old is he, anyway? Is he the one who put this crazy idea in your head?
No. He's--
He just gave us a ride.
That's all.
Hey, sorry it took me so long. We got a band.
[sighs] What are you doing?
Packing.
My father says I have to move to his hotel, so…
Until the audition? How are we gonna rehearse?
I'm not going to the audition.
Look,
I have to go back with him, okay?
Ben, he's my father, okay?
I just can't.
And with everything happening with Mimi,
-Yeah. -I have-- I just think… I should go.
-No, I get it. -Don't be like that.
I get it. It's okay.
-Ben. -It's fine.
-Hi. -Hey.
Did you see how fast he went down?
That's because you threw your whole body into that punch, like I taught you.
You did really good.
Hey, come here.
Thank you.
-I'm sorry. -It's okay.
It's not your fault.
-[Pete] Hey, Mimi. -Hey.
Got it?
I can't believe this trip is over.
[Lucy] I know, God. Doesn't it feel like we left home a million years ago?
Yeah.
[Mimi] Hey, y'all.
Thanks.
For what?
For coming on this trip with me.
Thank you.
Mimi and I were talking, and we were thinking--
That you need to stay and go to the audition.
-Yeah. -Guys, I can't do that.
-I can't. -You've got to.
Kit and I voted and you lost. So, you gotta go.
[Pete] All right, baby.
Ready to head home? I'm coming.
Ladies, let's roll.
Come on. Let's go.
[Kit] We tried.
Here you go, buddy.
[man] Thank you, sir.
-I'll take that, sweetie. -I'll put them in the back.
[Ben] Lucy.
[Lucy] Ben.
Goodbye, Lucy.
Goodbye.
It's gonna feel good to get back home, won't it?
[Pete] Look, honey,
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I wasn't angry at you. I was angry at what you did.
-Okay? -Okay.
Pop…
I don't wanna be like her.
We'll just get back home, and everything will be back to normal.
You just wait and see.
Don't make me do what she did.
Don't make me run.
Just let me go, okay?

My baby!
[Lucy] This time, we didn't make any wishes for the future.
We said goodbye to our past.
Now, none of us has any idea where life's gonna take us,
'cause what we have is now.
And right now, we have each other.
Let's do this thing!
[man] Action!
Whoa! Sorry!
♪ I need to make mistakes Just to learn who I am ♪ I'm sorry!
[Britney screams and laughs] I'm sorry!
We have killed Mesopotamians!
We have killed Assyrians,
Mycenaeans, Sumerians.
But
we have never had the pleasure
of killing
an Akkadian.
Which limb do I take first?
May the gods have pity on you
because my brother will not.
You missed.
You're lucky we have the same mother.
[narrator] Before the time of the pyramids a fearsome horde came from the east
and swept across the barren lands of the ancient world.
By the law of the horde
their greatest warrior was proclaimed their king.
His name was Memnon.
He was the greatest swordsman the world had ever seen.
With the predictions of a sorcerer
who could foretell the outcome of every battle,
Memnon slaughtered all who resisted him
until only a brave few remained.
-Silence! -My father has called for silence!
Hold your tongues!
We are gathered in this place to put our differences aside.
There is still time for us, the last of the free tribes,
to stand together against this tyrant.
With his sorcerer at his side, no mortal can defeat Memnon.
And if the sorcerer were to die, what then?
And if the sorcerer were to die, what then? It's too late for your schemes, Pheron.
I have raided Memnon's caravans, broken the supply lines to his troops,
but he still swept across the land like a plague.
I will not send my people to their deaths in a battle that can't be won.
And what people would that be, Balthazar?
You are the ruler of nothing
but a pile of rocks and sand.
If I'm no king,
why are you on your knees before me?
Balthazar! Guards!
Akkadians. I thought they were wiped out long ago.
[King Pheron] They are the last of their kind.
By their hand, the sorcerer will die.
You put your faith in a clan of cutthroats who kill for money?
They are more than that. They are skilled assassins
trained for generations in the deadly arts.
And what price do these mercenaries ask from us, Father?
Twenty blood rubies.
-That's the last of our treasury. -Be quiet.
If these men kill the sorcerer, will you fight?
So be it.
As long as one of us still breathes
the sorcerer will die.
Assassin!
Him, we'll kill for free.
[Jesup] We can reach Memnon's encampment by nightfall.
When are you gonna get rid of that filthy beast?
He doesn't mean anything by it.
-Horses are faster. -But camels are smarter.
[Mathayus] That one's mine.
Live free.
Die well.
Stop. Stop. Listen to me. I am a high priest of Set.
Spare me, and I shall bless thee in five different languages.
You'll scream in five different languages. -Horse thief. -Wait! Wait!
-Horse thief. -Wait! Wait!
Hey! I'm not that heavy.
Look out for the fat one! He's behind you!
Help me! Help me! Whoever you are, help me!
-Oh, thank you. Thank you, good sir. -Quiet.
Surely you've heard of the enormous reward for my safe return.
[Jesup] The sorcerer's tent.
Back!
[guard 1] Make way! [guard 2] Find the other one!
You've been betrayed, Mathayus.
-You know my name? -And why you're here.
[guard 1] He's in the tent!
[guard 2] You! Move around back!
A living, breathing Akkadian. This is a rare pleasure.
I hear you train yourselves to bear great pain.
You must teach me this, if you live long enough.
Not looking so full of yourself, are you now, assassin?
You betrayed your own father?
Yes. He was very shocked.
You could tell by the look on his face.
By my father's head, I pledge my allegiance.
[Memnon] You have proven your loyalty, Takmet.
This one still lives.
Beautiful.
Bring him to me.
Mathayus. Mathayus.
Live free.
Die well, my brother.
So,
how shall this one die?
-He shall not die tonight. -Really?
-We shall see. -Nor shall he die by your hand
or any hand you command.
You have seen this in a vision?
To ignore this would bring great misfortune.
The gods show him favor on this night.
Just the gods?
A puzzle then.
How to kill you without using my hand or any hand I command?
[Arpid] Fascinating, isn't it?
The smoke, it causes the fire ants to abandon their homes, you see?
All the sooner to feast on our naked heads.
-You think this is funny? -It's a little bit funny. Yes.
You see, I am about to escape while you are about to die a horrible death for leaving me to die last night.
while you are about to die a horrible death for leaving me to die last night.
-So what are you waiting for? -You see that one up there?
He's been drinking that yak piss for about an hour now and sometime very soon...
Ah, you see?
Hey! Where's the horse thief?
All right. Come on. Get me outta here.
Do you promise not to kill me?
-Yes, I promise. -Remember, you are an Akkadian.
You make an oath, you always have to keep it, right?
That's right.
Promise to take me with you and share in the spoils of your adventures.
What? All right. Fine. Yes, I promise.
All right. Now hold still.
Oh, here's one. That's a big one!
My! Here comes the mother.
[Arpid] So, where are we going?
[Mathayus] To Memnon's kingdom to avenge my brother's death.
-Never touch the bow. -Not a problem.
-Who are you calling? -My ride.
It's a nice camel.
Not much room back here. Scoot up, please.
Hey! We had a deal!
That's right. And I haven't killed you yet.
[Memnon] What news from my sorceress today?
[Memnon] What news?
Your armies will conquer in the west.
Queen Isis's forces will scatter to the four winds.
Give the generals the news.
Have them make their armies ready for the final campaign.
Yes, my lord.
[Memnon] You think I'm cruel, don't you?
Perhaps you've forgotten what it's like outside these walls.
Heartless, ignorant, and savage.
But I can change that.
I will bring order after centuries of chaos.
An order which will last for 1,000 years.
Rivers of blood can never bring peace.
But they can bring obedience. That will suffice for now.
And when I have become the king of legend,
then you shall take your place beside me
on a throne and in my bed.
But, my lord,
in your bed I would lose my gift of sight
and you would lose your advantage in battle.
The day I speak of
is the day I no longer need your vision.
[Arpid] Gomorrah.
Let me tell you, after a hard day of looting and pillaging, there is no greater city than Gomorrah.
after a hard day of looting and pillaging, there is no greater city than Gomorrah.
Except maybe Sodom.
-I wish I could join you. -You're not going?
Believe me, I'd like to even the score with a few of those Red Guards myself.
But with the price I've got on my head, I'd never make it through those gates.
I have faith in you, my friend. You'll get us in.
You see? They've got the city sealed up tighter than a crab's buttocks.
I wish there was something I could do to help, but...
Oh, but there is.
What business do you have here?
I've come to collect a bounty.
-Horse thief. -Oh. I know this dog.
They'll behead him for sure this time.
He'll be all the prettier without it.
-What happened? -You got us in. I knew you could do it.
A jug of your finest wine for my road-weary friend here.
Wait a minute. The last thing that...
That I remember was this huge Akkadian fist coming straight into...
Here's your wine, sir.
Please, let me know if there's anything else you'd like.
It's good to be back in the big city.
-Watch my camel for me? -Gladly.
Been working here long time?
How's the kebab?
[merchant] Merchandise of the highest quality.
Virgin steel forged by the monks of Pompeii.
Here! Here they are! The world's finest swords.
You can't get respect in Gomorrah without a quality blade...
Birds of paradise, birds of prey.
The most beautiful birds in the world.
Hey, soldier. Those big muscles look cramped.
-Perhaps one of us can help you relax. -Maybe all of us.
Mister, mister. Guide, mister.
You need a guide to find your way in Gomorrah.
A good guide might be able to show me a way into Memnon's palace.
But a smart guide wouldn't, or he'd be shown into Memnon's dungeon.
I don't have it.
Do you wanna earn this one?
Get ready. I'll kill half, you kill half.
All right. I'll kill them all.
How about we go around them and not kill anybody?
-Good Lord. Are you going to kill me? -Maybe later.
Memnon's always threatening to have my head.
[Philos] Don't touch that.
-What is it? -That's my special magic powder.
[Tutu] Magic powder?
Yeah, magic powder.
It's a Chinese formula that I procured at great expense.
If I get the recipe right, it'll move mountains,
clear roadways in an instant.
Do great things, wonderful things.
Or terrible things.
Like all my inventions, Memnon will try to use it for war.
-Where is Memnon? -Oh, you mean to kill him, do you?
-Yes. -Well, in that case,
I'd say he was in the training courtyard.
Thank you!
[Tutu] No! Let me go!
I didn't do anything!
You know the penalty for thievery.
No!
Oh, no.
No!
[guard] Intruder!
Follow me!
-You again. -How do I get outta here?
Through that door.
-What's that? -That's one of my latest inventions.
It was meant to be a means of quick transportation
but there was a little problem with the landings.
[Thorak] Open!
-Open! -Don't touch that. You'll set it off.
Right.
-Oh. -Oh, my!
A man.
-What is this place? -Lord Memnon's harem.
-But he visits so rarely. -And it gets so lonely.
-Can't you leave me alone, Thorak? -Watch your tongue, Philos.
Careful with those! They're delicate instruments.
You're lucky Lord Memnon has a taste for your "science," you old fool.
If I find out you had anything to do with this intruder
I will send the executioner.
We know how to please.
-Oh, I'm sure you do, ladies, but I... -Stay with us.
-Stay with us. -That's nice, but now's not a good time.
We will make your every fantasy come true.
Kill him!
After him!
Go get him!
Well, are you gonna try to kill me or just stare at me?
Ow!
Take a breath.
Gods be praised!
How dare you touch me!
Sorceress, I am an Akkadian hired to kill you.
Now, I find myself in a position where you are of more use to me alive.
Don't make me change my mind.
And he said it's not the size of the hump,
it is the motion of the camel.
Alas, I must leave you now.
-There's the traitor! -Oh, great gods!
He is dead!
Just admit it, you smelly camel!
I am your master now! You belong to me!
He's dead! Dead!
Dead!
You are alive. I knew it!
Right.
I was just saying to the camel, "Camel, no one could kill our good friend Mathayus."
"Camel, no one could kill our good friend Mathayus."
Get on.
Why should I make it easy for you? You're sworn to kill me.
Others will die first.
That's comforting.
-So who is your friend? -Memnon's sorcerer.
Memnon's sorcerer? Are you insane? She's going to get us all killed!
Memnon will have to leave the safety of his palace to get her.
So you're going to use me first and then kill me?
I feel so much better.
I could always do it the other way around and kill you first.
So where are we going?
-The Valley of the Dead. -The Valley of the Dead?
Nobody goes to the Valley of the Dead!
That's why they call it the Valley of the Dead!
Wait for me, please!
Take a dozen of your best men, track him down, kill him,
and bring her back to me.
Send me news when he's dead.
-Yes, my lord. -My lord.
There are rumors spreading to the armies that she's gone.
-Is this true? -It is, my lord.
Then silence them! They must believe she is here,
if only for a short time.
And when you find the Akkadian,
give him this from me.
[Arpid] Are we where I think we are?
Yes.
Home.
Where are you going, Sorceress?
In a hurry to get back to Memnon? No, I'm in a hurry to get away from you. I'll never go back to Memnon.
No, I'm in a hurry to get away from you. I'll never go back to Memnon. He's kept me prisoner since I was a child.
Why did you help me that night in the tent?
I knew you were the one man who could help me escape.
Run if you like. There are worse dangers out there than me.
[Mathayus] What do you mean you can't find it?
-I know it's around here somewhere. -What are you looking for?
Just a little place to get out of the storm.
-What storm? -You'll see.
Thorak.
Memnon didn't come, did he?
-Sent his maggots to do his work. -He's smarter than you think.
Or more cowardly.
Can I go home now?
Stay here. Cover up.
You'll be safe.
He's attacking! Alone?
The sun has fried his brain.
One thousand duranas for the one that brings me his head.
[Thorak] Akkadian bastard!
Where is he?
This way!
You two first. Come on. Go.
Stay on the stones.
Come with me.
Don't touch that.
[Thorak] Coward!
Show your face!
The Akkadian.
Mathayus!
[Arpid] You are alive! You swatted them like flies! You are invincible!
You swatted them like flies! You are invincible!
Tell me. Do you think you can save him?
His fever's high. The poison was made with scorpion venom.
If he does live, the blood of the scorpion will always flow through his veins.
Sorceress.
It's a miracle.
She cured you. I knew it! I felt her magic!
It almost killed her, but the gods, they were on our side.
Why? Why would you risk your life to save mine?
Because I believe you can save the people.
The people are not my problem. Memnon is.
You and the people have the same problem.
Pardon, my lord. A message from Thorak.
Finally, the Akkadian is dead.
Is there something wrong, my lord?
Not at all. Everything is in order.
In fact, things are going so well
that I'm moving up our plans.
Tomorrow night, we feast to celebrate our impending victory.
And then we'll drive the last of the rebels into the sea.
Now, go.
My lord,
it is customary for the sorceress to be present at these meetings.
Why is she not here today?
-She's indisposed. -It is nothing serious, I hope.
If it were serious, then you would know about it.
Now, go!
She is alive. She is with him and he's coming here.
Get ready.
It works! It works!
My lady. How lovely to see you out here in this desolate place!
Let me show you. It works!
Come, come, come!
My lady sorceress.
You see? I worked it out.
My Chinese formula. My magic powder works!
All I needed was salt. Petered salt.
It was here all the time. This place is just full of it.
By the way, do any of you happen to have any water?
What do you think? Is it safe to drink?
Not anymore. Delicious. The sandstone must act as a natural filter.
Delicious. The sandstone must act as a natural filter.
Quiet.
I'm alive! I'm alive!
For the moment.
Mathayus.
Move!
Assassin. The gods are good to me.
When we last met, you offered to kill me.
Now I have a chance to return the favor.
You're trespassers here.
Our survival depends on this place being kept a secret.
So we have a problem as long as you're alive.
[Arpid] No problem. I can keep a secret like no other.
In fact, I cannot remember how we got here. We took a left turn...
-It's too late for that. -[Queen Isis] Balthazar!
This place is sanctuary for all of Memnon's enemies. -You know that. -This man is dangerous.
-You know that. -This man is dangerous.
-Your judgment is clouded. -My judgment keeps all of you alive.
This man cannot be trusted, and I'll prove it.
Bring the woman to me.
The first man to touch her will have to come through me.
I had hoped for nothing less.
That's not fair.
[woman] Get him.
No!
Yeah!
-Do you yield? -Never.
Then you're a fool.
-We're brothers in the same cause. -Brothers?
You brought death to my people.
Memnon will follow you. He will come for his sorceress.
Yes, I know who she is.
And Memnon will stop at nothing till she's returned.
He'll come swifter and deadlier once he has her.
Memnon will stop at nothing.
Hide here as long as you can, but believe me when I say he'll find you.
And if he isn't stopped, he'll sweep across this land and kill all of you.
And who's gonna stop him, Akkadian?
You? Will you stand alone before the fury of his armies?
Yes.
Push, push! That's it!
-A gentleman always lets a lady win. -You didn't.
Best two out of three?
Dates?
Oh, thank you.
[Memnon] Cassandra!
[Arpid] Yes, that's good fun!
I've had a vision.
Memnon will follow me here and destroy these people.
You know this?
The things I see are like shimmers in a pond.
Some are certain, and some remain shadows.
But I do know this.
Memnon will release his armies and ride straight through this place.
Memnon will die by my hand.
It seems the gods favor me tonight, Akkadian.
If you face Memnon, you'll die.
That is your destiny.
I make my own destiny.
I need your help.
[Arpid] You can't leave us here. [Philos] Mathayus, don't be so stubborn. Listen to reason.
[Philos] Mathayus, don't be so stubborn. Listen to reason. You can't go alone. You're going to get yourself killed.
Where do you think you're going with my horse?
To Gomorrah. Nothing we can say will stop him.
Without your sorceress?
She returned to save the lives of your people.
I won't let her face Memnon's wrath alone.
-Step aside. -[Balthazar] Akkadian,
you're riding to your death.
If I let you ride alone,
what glory will there be left for me?
So tonight we celebrate.
Eat and drink your fill
for tomorrow we ride into battle.
I would've captured him myself, but he ran like a coward.
He left his bow behind.
My lord.
There is something that is troubling our soldiers.
How distressing. Pray tell.
It's been said the sorceress is no longer by your side.
Soldiers will fall prey
to idle palace gossip.
You have my word, she's perfectly safe.
If the men are to fight, to die,
they may need more than that.
-Do you doubt my word? -It is not that, sire.
It's just she is a symbol from which the men derive courage.
-Symbols are most effective when seen. -[Cassandra] My lord.
I am here at your request.
Pardon my absence.
I was not well.
But our impending victory has lifted my spirit.
Is this sufficient to placate your men?
Tell them what you see, Sorceress.
I see a great victory.
Your enemies will reveal themselves to you.
Halt.
-What is in the cart? -"What is in the cart"?
Actually, it is a bit of a surprise.
A gift for tonight's festivities.
Prince Takmet's request.
Very nice.
Well, now. Let's see that pretty little face.
Now go to my chambers. We have things to discuss.
My sincerest apologies, my lord.
I understand.
You are fearful, weak.
The feast is over.
To bed, men, for tomorrow we conquer.
Fortify the palace guard.
[Arpid] Whoa.
[Mathayus] All right. That was the easy part.
-Everybody know what to do? -Cripple the guards.
-Ignite the powder. -And try not to get killed.
What are you doing here? You could get hurt.
So could you.
Stay in the wagon.
You watch yourself, Akkadian.
-No need for concern, miss. -Oh, he's gonna pay for that.
Seal the gates. Seal all the gates.
Though I'm relieved to see you unharmed,
I am somewhat surprised the Akkadian didn't kill you.
He was after you. I was merely a pawn.
But you escaped his grasp?
I'm not without my wiles.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. Bring them.
Tomorrow my victory is complete. -That is your vision? -As I said, I have seen it.
-That is your vision? -As I said, I have seen it.
Have you?
I sense a change in you.
You seem somehow
diminished.
I assure you. I am myself.
Good. A small demonstration shouldn't trouble you then.
A simple test.
Now go. Everyone leave.
Where am I going?
Stop.
It's over there.
Should be just there.
[Philos] Good man.
Well, well.
What do we have here?
One at a time.
Six urns, four cobras.
Now, let's see what you can see.
Excellent.
One empty pot left now.
Who dies first?
We're almost there.
You know what I see? Fear.
You have lost your power,
thrown it all away.
-What magic is this? -My magic.
I see your fate, hollow king.
And its time has come.
You wish to test magic against steel?
I've come for the woman and your head.
The assassin and the sorceress,
how romantic.
I'll bury you both together.
And here it is, the foundation stone.
-Hurry, we're running out of time. -I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying.
Fire in front, palace guard at your back.
Looks like I'll be keeping my head after all, Akkadian.
Kill the witch!
Mathayus!
For your father.
Die well, assassin.
It seems the gods favor me tonight, Akkadian.
Mathayus!
Hurry up and light it.
You hurry up and light it. This is your invention.
Follow me.
Ready! Weapons!
Charge!
So much for not getting killed.
Catch this.
-Hail to the king! -[soldiers] Hail, hail!
I knew it from the start.
-Hail! -Yeah!
Mathayus!
Stay here with us, Balthazar. There's much work to be done.
I have to look after my own people.
You're a king now, Akkadian, and a good one, I think.
Don't forget how you got here or the people you came from.
My people will live on through me.
Remember, there'll always be a place for you here.
-Live free. -Rule well.
Remember, Nubian eyes will be watching you, Scorpion King.
I see a time of great peace and prosperity ahead.
How is it you see this?
Don't the legends say you'll lose your powers if you...
Can you think of a better way to keep a king from taking advantage?
Well, neither could my ancestors.
And how long will this time of peace last?
Nothing lasts forever, my king.
Courtyard in back, south-facing garden. Perfect.
-Shouldn't we wait for the car service? -No, we'll sit in traffic forever.
-Is that the listing sheet? -There isn't one.
I heard about it this morning. It'll be gone today.
-How many more? -None. You know the market is tight.
-Sarah, do you have to ride that here? -Mom, we're in the street.
Evan!
One day you will learn to respect people's time, Lydia.
You'll realize that the world does not stop and start at your convenience.
I'm so sorry.
I'm meeting Arthur Digby Laurence in 26 minutes...
...and if you think he's the kind of man who tolerates tardiness...
...you are sadly mistaken.
You're a saint to wait for us.
-Hey. -Hello.
It's kind of between a townhouse and a brownstone.
We call it a "townstone."
Built in 1879. This is the middle of the house, the parlor floor.
Here is the living room. Formal dining is in the back.
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...
...which was renovated in '94 with all the expected amenities.
Sarah.
There are two bedroom floors above.
My God, it's amazing. Hey, kid. No scooter.
I don't have to tell you this amount of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.
It's got a yard. Sort of.
It is in a bit of disarray, but then again, 21-foot lot, 53 deep.
It allows for an expansive garden.
Working elevator.
The previous owner was disabled the last years of his life.
Highly unusual, the elevator.
You will not find this in 90 percent of brownstones.
Perhaps it's something of a fixer-upper, but we anticipate enormous interest.
It's a very emotional property.
Shall we have a look at the rest?
You should make an offer immediately.
Can I see it first?
There is nothing like this on the market right now.
You can't move from Greenwich to the Upper West Side...
...and expect to still have a house, a yard and a dog and cat, but here it is.
It's got everything you told me you wanted and more.
You'll have another family. You could have two.
It's a fortune.
Mom, it's not Barneys. You don't have to pay the price on the tag.
He can afford it.
It would be so lovely if I could show the property before I leave.
Hardwood floors throughout, as many as six working fireplaces.
This is the top floor. Two bedrooms. One at either end.
They share one small bath.
Originally, this would have been the servants' quarters.
The previous owner kept a small nursing staff.
I don't know if you have live-in help.
No, it's just the two of us.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den or what have you.
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine, the financier.
May I ask what you do, Mrs....
Altman.
Actually, I'm going back to school. Columbia.
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals.
I didn't realize you were Stephen Altman's wife.
Yes, until recently.
Master bath.
Pearlstine's been in all the papers since he died.
His kids are suing each other over the estate.
He was a recluse. Rich, paranoid.
Now they can't find half his money.
I hardly see how gossip is germane to showing the property.
Stop calling it "the property." It sounds ridiculous.
Walk-in closet.
Could the little one please stop that?
Kid, no elevator!
And we emerge in the master suite.
That's strange.
What?
Is this room smaller than it should be?
You're the first person to notice.
On caravan, no one from our office had the slightest idea.
It's called a panic room.
-What? -A safe room.
-A castle keep in medieval times. -I've read about these.
They're in vogue in high-end construction.
One can't be too careful about home invasion.
This is perfect.
The alarm goes off in the middle of the night.
What will you do? Call the police and wait till Tuesday?
What will you do? Call the police and wait till Tuesday? Traipse downstairs in your underthings to check it out? I think not.
Concrete walls. Buried phone line, not connected to the house's main line.
Call the police, nobody can cut you off. You have your own ventilation system.
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers nearly every corner of the house.
This whole thing makes me nervous.
Why?
Ever read any Poe?
No, but I loved her last album.
What's to keep somebody from prying open the door?
Steel.
Thick steel. Very thick steel.
Full battery backup, so even if the power's out...
...it's still functional.
Oh, my God. Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he?
Open it, please.
And with kids like he's apparently got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
Please open the door.
That is highly inappropriate.
Open the door, please.
My room. Definitely my room.
This is really dangerous.
-That door is a hazard. -Not at all.
Motion detector, like an elevator.
The door won't close if it's blocked. There's another one at your ankles.
It couldn't be safer.
I know they'll take asking price.
It's working. I hooked up the phone!
Good for you, Mom. Hooked up a phone.
579 what?
3000.
Patsy's Pizza. Please hold.
Hey. Enough.
Mind the pizza?
What do you mean?
Our first night. I should've thought of something special.
I like pizza.
Fuck him.
Don't.
Fuck her, too.
I agree.
But don't.
Don't you think this place has way too many stairs?
You didn't carry anything up them.
You never asked what I thought of this house.
I didn't want you to tell me you hated it.
-I liked our old house. -Well, so did I.
You know what I was thinking?
I was thinking we could stencil the whole bookcase.
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.
Go ahead.
Oh, damn.
I forgot to set up that tour of your new school.
Dad already did it. I'm going with him on Sunday.
Oh, yeah?
So I'll take a cab and meet him there.
Is that what he said?
Isn't that what's so great about Manhattan?
You don't have to drive me everywhere?
I'll ride with you.
Why'd you bring me here if I can't go anywhere on my own?
That's it. I quit.
I'm not fighting with you till tomorrow.
Come here.
It's disgusting how much I love you.
Tell me about it.
-Mom? -Yeah.
It's too dark.
Better?
That's better.
"Bypass non-ready zone."
"Bypass non-ready zone."
"Shunt. Enter."
"Bypass non-ready zone."
"Shunt."
"Enter zone number."
"Shunt again."
In the morning I got to figure out how to turn this thing off.
Go, go back.
Do it.
Come on. Come on. Jesus fucking Christ.
Amateur.
We got a problem! We need to talk!
It's about time. I'm freezing my tits off out there.
-Who is that? -This is Raoul.
Who the fuck is Raoul?
Raoul is okay. Raoul has experience.
-Where'd you get him? -Through some people.
Open the fucking door.
-Hey. -No shit.
What is this?
There's a girl on the top floor, a woman on the third. They're asleep.
They're not supposed to be here.
-This is your department, Junior! -They are not supposed to be here!
Videotape. We're on videotape.
We've been on videotape since we got here and the tapes are upstairs.
-14-day escrow. -You fucked me!
14-day escrow! That's almost three weeks! They should not be in for another week!
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?
Business days. Escrow is always business days.
Five-day weeks always!
Right?
I'm out of here.
Just wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Just wait a minute. Wait a minute! We can handle this. Can we still handle this?
We can handle this. Can we still handle this?
It's just a woman and a kid?
-Unless Daddy comes home. -He's not.
They're divorcing. Daddy's banging some B model on the Upper East Side.
It's just her and the kid!
Now, can we do this?
Yeah, we can do it. Not with people here. And not with me.
Not with people here. And not with me.
-Wait! Twenty minutes! -She'll call the police.
They'll be here before I unpack my bags.
So we keep an eye on her.
Raoul can totally administrate that part.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that! He's not even supposed to be here!
Nobody gets hurt.
What about us? What if she has a gun?
Who are you?
I'm Raoul.
You know we can't do this without you!
This is still a good plan.
Fuck that! This is a great plan. It's just got a slight twist.
Yeah.
Felony kidnapping. Thirty years.
You make a lot of promises, don't you? You promise me, you promise your kids.
No family.
You're right. It's all fucked up. I fucked it up!
It's not how it's supposed to be.
But the fact of the matter is there's still $3,000,000 in this house...
...and no one but you and I even knows it's here.
Hey, I want that money. I want it!
But you...
...you need that money.
Or have you forgotten why you're here?
So let's quit dicking around, okay, and get this over with.
Kill the phones.
Top floor, little girl. I've got the mother. Give me that!
You stay here! Nobody gets past!
Wake up! Sarah!
Get up!
What did you do that for?
Where are you going?
-What's going on? -People. In the house.
They're in the elevator, heading down.
Fuck! They're coming down to you!
I told you. I don't hurt people.
They're going downstairs.
-That room. -What?
The panic room.
No, press emergency stop.
Fuck!
Coming back up!
That's you.
Shit.
Go!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Damn it! Mother--
Shit!
That's seven years' bad luck.
Shit.
Tell me they're not in there.
Oh, damn.
-It doesn't work? -It's a different phone line.
I never hooked it up.
Now what?
I can't hear a thing.
What do you think they want?
I don't know. Rob us....
I don't know.
What do we do?
We wait.
-What if they get in here? -Well, they can't.
They can't get in. It's not possible.
Mom. I heard you.
-Do you feel okay? -Yeah.
-You shaky? -No.
-Chills? -No.
Please. Don't worry about me.
He's got kids. What do you think he'll do?
Hang out while the cops waltz in? Use your head.
Here he comes.
I locked the roof access. She's not getting down from there.
-Good. -She could be in there calling the cops.
Could she have hooked it up today? No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.
No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.
She would've had to do it through Manhattan Security, my company.
I checked the paperwork and the phone is not connected.
You see? She couldn't have.
-I thought she wouldn't be here. -He said she wouldn't.
Fuck you! And fuck you! She is not supposed--
Do it.
Excuse me.
The police are on their way.
-She's lying. -You're full of--
It's not an intercom. It's a PA system.
I know. I'm just scaring her.
I suggest you leave before they get here.
-What? -He's saying that we don't have a phone.
How could he know that?
Take what you want and get out!
If only it were that easy.
Some paper. I need some paper. Give me some paper.
Hey, Zorro! You going to help us out?
You got a piece of paper?
-What is he doing? -I don't know.
"What we want is in that room"?
They're coming in here, aren't they?
No, no. I told you. They can't get in here.
What do you know about this room?
What do we know about that room?
-Let's not tell her anything. -Just a few details.
We're not coming out, and we're not letting you in!
Get out of my house!
-Say "fuck." -You fuck.
-Mom. -What?
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Get the fuck out of my house!
Okay, I have an idea.
She's a woman. Women need security.
She won't believe you.
She needs to know she's dealing with decent people and she can trust us.
Conversation's over!
What? She's not coming down?
Shut up. Will you please shut up and let me think?
Like that'll help you think.
You know what? Fine! You think!
-What if she did call the cops? -She didn't.
She said it again, that she called the cops.
If cops were coming, do you think I'd still be here?
Okay, fine. Good, excellent. We all believe you.
How do we get into that room?
What is funny about this?
Is this shit funny to you?
I spent the last 12 years building these rooms...
...to keep out people like us.
It's all so ironic and amusing, okay? Now, how do we get in?
We can't.
You can't get in the panic room.
That's the whole point. We have to get her to come out.
And why would she do that?
I don't know.
But when she does, she can't get out of this house.
We keep her here, we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...
...and I don't want any help from Joe Pesci over here.
They want to hole up in this house? Fine.
We make it impossible for them to leave.
And why would they come out in the first place?
I'm working on that.
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
Small space?
I'm okay.
-You can't wig out. -I know.
-I mean it. -I won't.
You know, people never get buried alive anymore.
I guess it used to happen all the time.
Really?
Yeah, I read that.
And when did this happen all the time?
Twenty, thirty years ago.
What are they doing now?
I don't know.
They're locking us in.
This is not happening.
Sarah, calm down.
You know what could happen if you let yourself get worked up.
Sarah!
-What the hell are you doing? -We're coming in from below.
No, you're not. Even if you got through the concrete, there's steel.
You won't even make a dent.
We'll see.
Hey. This is what I do.
If some idiot with a sledgehammer could break in...
...do you really think that I would still have a job?
Don't get that in your eye.
Neighbor.
Help!
Please help us!
-Call the police! -Do you hear us?
Help us!
Help!
-Help us, please! -Call the police!
Shit!
You guys just going to stand there?
Why? What do you got, MacGyver?
He can't get in here with a hammer, can he?
Could you be any louder?
Give me a hand with those boxes.
Listen, goddamn it!
I'm in charge here. Now, what the hell is going on?
-They're going to get in here. -No, they can't get in here.
We're going to be fine. We'll be just fine.
Oh, this is good.
This could work.
I was just thinking that we should do something like this.
-Open it. -I just did.
Open it some more.
We're just sending them a message.
They'll get the point.
Honey, get down on the ground.
Quit dicking around and open this fucking thing up.
-Don't be stupid. -Quiet!
We're trying to scare them, not kill them.
What is it?
It's bad.
They're coughing.
If they're coughing, they're going to die!
Nobody is going to die, man!
Will you please have the balls to follow through with something?
Mom.
The worst that'll happen is they'll pass out. They'll have a hangover.
How are we going to get in there if they pass out, Junior?
Cut it back a little.
They won't pass out, numb-nuts. They'll throw up first.
We can't get in if they're dead!
Stay on the ground and breathe.
Turn it down.
Turn it down! It's too much! -Don't you start up with this shit. -Keep it down!
-Don't you start up with this shit. -Keep it down!
I'm turning it down.
-Keep his ass off of me. -I'm not killing anybody.
-Tell him to turn it down! -Turn the shit off.
-No. -Turn it down.
-Mom? -Just a second.
Mom.
Get under this.
Oh, my God.
-Fucking amateurs, man! -It's my fucking idea.
Shut the fuck up! There are people trying to sleep over there.
What is that?
Turn the gas off.
Turn the gas off right now.
Get back!
Shit!
God!
Get it off me!
It's okay.
You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch! I'm coming in there!
Calm the fuck down.
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
Promise me you'll never do anything like that.
I won't.
They're moving. At least they're still moving in there.
What?
Talk to him.
Please, man, give it a rest.
-That Morse code? -SOS.
Where'd you learn that?
Titanic.
We got to talk. Downstairs.
No, no, no. Not you.
Come on, come on, come on.
Get up.
Come on.
Wake up.
The first thing I'm going to do this morning is call my plastic surgeon.
There's been a change here. $100,000 is not enough. Not for this shit.
I want a third of whatever's in that room up there.
Fine!
Okay? Full share, one-third. Congratulations.
You bought a ski mask, made $1,000,000. Your parents will be proud.
Got him.
Let me straighten out something else. Get control of your goddamn expert.
I'm not losing my half of the money because--
Slow down. Half?
Did you sleep through grade school? Five seconds ago, it was a third....
Come on.
I'm letting you know he's a problem.
But this wasn't my idea, so he's your problem.
You're right. It wasn't your idea!
None of this was your idea! It was my idea!
Come on, look over here.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Let's hope this guy's an ex-Boy Scout.
-We're here! -Help us!
We're over here!
Help! Open your window!
Help!
We're never going to get out of here.
I'm the loving grandson who put in the time with the old man...
...every goddamn weekend for two years...
...talking to him, dressing him, walking him, feeding him.
Are you done?
No. I'm the one the old man finally told about the safe.
I'm the one who found the guy who built it, and I convinced him to break into it!
Wait a minute.
-What? -The bedroom's empty. Where are they?
Two of them, on the stairs.
Where's the third guy?
I left my cell phone by the bed.
I earned that money.
I will not let you jeopardize my fucking plan...
...because you have a problem relating to others!
Got it?
If I don't come back, close this door.
-Mom. -Just do what I say.
If he touches me again, I'll shoot him.
Christ!
Wait!
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle, or can we get back to work?
Don't take no tone with me, jerk-wad.
I'll shove it up your ass and snap it off.
You're a bus driver, Raoul.
You live in Flatbush.
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard bullshit you just heard...
...because I saw that movie, too.
What is this?
I got some news for you.
Go.
Go!
Fuck!
She got something. What did she get?
No.
Charger!
She has a cell phone.
No!
All right, signal.
Come on. Signal.
I don't think they'll be talking on no cell phone from in there.
-Why not? -You can't call out from in there.
No signal.
I didn't hook up this line, but I hooked up the main line.
If we can find it, we can cut into it.
I can't go to prison, man. I'm not built for that shit.
Be careful.
Get the phone.
-It doesn't come off. -Rip it off!
Screwdriver. Phillips.
Junior, when I asked you to cut the phone lines, did you cut the main line?
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone in the kitchen?
Shit!
Strip this and expose the wires.
-What are we doing? -I have no idea.
-Okay, got it? -Yeah. Here.
Okay.
Yellow, yellow.
Okay.
Dial tone.
911 Emergency.
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street--
-Please hold. -No, no. God.
Call Dad.
How do you live in New York and not have a single Percocet?
-Hello? -Stephen. Put Stephen on the line.
-Who is this? -It's Meg.
Do you know what time it is?
-Put him on the phone, bitch. -It's your fucking wife.
Move.
-Hello? -You've got to help us.
Move!
There are three men upstairs. They broke in--
What--
-He'll do something. -No, he won't.
He'll call the police.
You don't know her. She won't let him.
No. He knows that there's trouble. He heard me.
He's across the park. That's why we got houses close to each other.
Just in case we needed each other. He'll help us.
-He won't. -Yes, he will!
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
Why?
I was trying not to tell you.
What?
I'm dizzy and hungry.
All she's got is NyQuil and fucking Midol.
Looks like that gas idea didn't work out so well.
Whose fault was that?
This is impossible.
What's the plan now, hot rod?
This is worse than impossible. This is unpleasant.
Here, drink this. All right, drink lots of water.
You dropped to the low 40s. We have to get your blood-sugar up.
Can you hear me okay?
I'm just dizzy, not deaf.
Great. Smart-ass. That's excellent.
Did you see anything in here? Any candy bars or something sweet?
Let's check it again.
Mom, I did it.
We got to stay calm, okay?
If we stay calm, everything will be fine. All right? Stay calm.
You're making me nervous.
I'm sorry.
What if I keep dropping?
You won't. I'll figure something out.
You know, he's right.
There's no way we're getting into that room.
What are you talking about?
I just got to be honest with myself here.
I don't need to be involved...
...with anything so harrowing or perilous at this point in my life.
-You're giving up? -Hell, yes.
I don't need the fucking aggravation. I'll make an anonymous phone call.
They'll find the floor safe. I'll inherit.
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.
Fuck, I'll still put away 800 or 900 grand and keep my goddamn hair.
Take it. Go out and get loaded.
Wait a minute.
Say what you just said again.
Say that shit about the money again, babycakes.
When? Before?
Yeah, before.
Splitting the money in your head, you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand.
What are you doing?
That was after tax, which makes it more than a million and a half gross.
So now you're a tax attorney.
-I'm out of here. -Wait a minute.
There's sugar in everything. Places you'd never expect. Like ketchup.
Where else?
Travel kit.
Plus, you named eight people you got to split it with...
...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks in the safe.
A fuckup like you has got to get less than everybody else...
...so now I don't know what to think.
You're adding up money you'll never touch, buddy.
How much is in there?
Mouthwash.
Saccharin.
Hey, I'm talking to you. Answer me.
Fine. There's more.
And when were you going to tell us this minor economic detail?
It doesn't matter now. It's totally fucking moot!
-Why are we having this conversation? -What were you thinking?
How did you expect to get away with this?
Did you think that I'd open that safe...
...and then me and Raoul would wait while you picked out your share?
What's the matter with you?
You got us into this mess, and you were going to fuck us?
You got yourself into this. You got the custody lawyers up your ass.
Your eyes were huge when I told you about the gig...
...so don't play innocent.
Things didn't work out.
Play past it.
Mints? Sugar-free.
I'm opening that safe. You leave, you get nothing.
It's looking doubtful there, big guy.
I will split the money with Raoul. But I don't ever want to see you again.
Cops show up on my doorstep, we will know who sent them...
...and we will fucking find you.
I'll see you, Burnham.
Later, Raoul.
Mom!
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street a couple of times...
...think you know all about it.
You don't know nothing about me.
Sarah, listen to me.
Go to the corner. Shut your eyes and don't turn around.
Okay.
You should see the look on your face.
What's happening?
-Don't move. Don't you fucking move. -No, don't.
Come here.
Come here.
-Don't shoot, please. -Come on.
Shut it, lock it and get the fuck away from it.
-Stop it, you fucking-- -Fucking what?
Clown? Idiot? Fucking asshole?
Who's the clown now?
Me.
That's right. It's burning me.
Who's got the gun?
You.
Remember that.
Find out who the fuck that is.
Give me your wallet.
Give me your wallet.
Stephen Altman.
Did your wife give you a call, Stephen?
What did she say?
Don't know. Cut off.
-Phones are dead. -Did you call anybody else?
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephen?
No.
He's telling the truth.
Yeah.
Yeah, he probably is.
Because when I do this, people don't lie.
What?
-What do you want? -Get us into that room.
-What do you want? -Get us into that room. -I can't. -Yeah, you can.
-I can't. -Yeah, you can.
You're full of ideas. You just got to squeeze one out.
You want me to just make something up?
You've got till the count of three.
Then you end up like Junior over there.
-One, squeeze. -This is ridiculous.
Two, squeeze.
I don't know what to tell you.
-Three. -Wait!
Okay.
I got an idea.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Help!, Rubber Soul...
...Yesterday and Today, Magical Mystery Tour, the White Album....
Stay warm, baby. Stay warm, all right?
Let It Be, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper....
Oh, God!
Dad?
No, no.
Take it easy.
Open the door! Open the door!
-Meg. -No.
Don't open the door!
-Just make it look good. -Don't you tell me what--
Open the door!
Don't! Don't open--
Knock it off!
You kill him, they'll never open that door.
Oh, God.
All right. Lie down. Lie down.
Lie down.
All right.
You'll be fine. Come on.
He's fucking crazy.
Get your hands off him, you frightening hillbilly motherfucker!
You're a strong girl.
You be strong. Be strong, sweetheart.
Get the fuck off him, now! Just get off him!
It's almost over.
Yeah, that's it. That's it.
Okay. All right, turn around.
I'll be right back. I'll be right back.
It's got blood on it. You might want to wear it inside out.
Get your tapes.
Who's this?
It's her kid.
What happened to her?
Who gives a fuck?
Hurry up. Get your stuff.
Hey, lady.
Mom?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
We've got your kid.
Come down here.
Let's get this over with.
Get her, get her!
Shit!
What is it? No! Let her out!
-Where's your gun? Where's your gun? -Open the door.
No!
-Where's your gun? -I don't know.
Open up!
Open it.
Shut up! Listen to me. She's got your gun.
She's got your gun!
Stop screaming. Stop it.
I know you've got the gun.
Put the gun down and step away from the door.
You got to open the door. My daughter is very sick.
She needs an injection.
Do you hear me?
Open the door so I can give her a shot.
Or I swear to God, I'll kill you both.
If I open the door, you'll shoot us.
So give her the shot yourself.
Give her the shot!
Do you need this?
Can you do this yourself?
What happens if you don't get it?
Coma.
Die.
Fuck! Open it.
Put the gun on the floor. And go all the way downstairs.
And I'll give her the shot, all right?
I told you to leave the gun!
Shit.
You fucking bitch!
If you pull any shit like that again, I will fucking kill her.
Do you hear me?
If you step outside, I'll kill her!
If I see a uniform inside this house, I'll cut her fucking throat!
Do you understand?
Yes.
But please, just give her the shot.
Please.
Please.
Don't fucking do it.
While we're in here, she'll call the cops.
Are you going to open the safe?
Don't you look at me.
All I know about this is what I see on TV.
You got to talk me through this.
This right here?
It's this?
Yeah, okay.
Nice house you guys got.
Your mom's rich.
Dad's rich. Mom's just mad.
Tap it.
I wish I could have put my kid in a place like this.
It's not that I didn't try.
Sometimes things, they don't work out the way you want them to.
Done.
Wasn't supposed to be like this.
He had it all worked out.
Nobody was supposed to even be here.
Thanks...
...Burnham.
Wasn't supposed to be like this.
She's going to be okay.
I gave her the shot. She's all right.
It'll be over soon.
Stephen.
Oh, my God.
Can you move?
Not much. I think my arm is broken.
Raise your arm.
Come on, raise your arm.
Try again.
Come on. Try again.
Meg, please don't do anything stupid.
They're going to kill us.
Just do everything they ask. It'll be okay that way.
Stephen, they'll kill her.
Holy shit. She called the goddamn cops.
The police.
You called the police?
Of course I called them.
You scared the shit out of me.
She killed the kid.
She just killed her own kid.
All right, take this.
Don't say a word.
No, her husband must have called them.
Foreign son of a bitch. I told you!
Where is she?
There.
What the fuck's she doing?
She's going to handle it.
I'm just trying to unlock....
-Is everything okay? -You all right, ma'am?
What are you.... What time is it?
It's a little after 4:00 a.m.
We got a call, ma'am.
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
What do you want?
-We'd like to come in. -No, you can't come in.
Ma'am, you sure you're all right?
I'm fine.
Ma'am, you don't look so good.
Well, you don't look so hot yourself, Officer Keeney.
Come on, I'm freezing out here.
"There are three."
What?
Your husband said you called for help.
That you said, "There are three," right before you got cut off.
Oh, that phone call.
And your neighbors...
...called in about some loud shouts or a loudspeaker of some kind?
That was the TV. It's off now.
Can I just ask you one question?
What was the end of that sentence?
When you said, "There are three"...
...what was the rest?
Look....
My husband and I just split up...
...and it's my first night in a new house...
...and I admit I was a little drunk.
And the sentence, if you insist on knowing...
...was going to be:
"There are three things that I'll do for you if you come jump into bed with me."
Thank God I came to my senses before I said all that, and I hung up...
...so nobody would ever have to know what I was thinking.
Unless, of course...
...two policemen came in the middle of the night and interrogated me.
So, Rick, you want to go?
Or do you want her to tell you which three things?
All right.
Ma'am...
...if there's something you want to say to us...
...but maybe you can't say it right now...
...you might want to make some kind of a signal...
...by blinking your eyes a few times.
Something like that.
That's something you could do safely.
Man...
...you guys are good.
You mean, like if there was somebody in the house or something?
They really train you guys.
No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Cross my heart.
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.
Night, ma'am.
This kid has seen my face.
Yeah, well, that's not my problem.
Yeah, it is. You're here with me.
You're on the hook, too.
Do one. Same price for the rest.
Stay the fuck away from me.
You know how this is going to end.
Goddamn!
What's up?
Why the hell didn't we do that?
What's she doing? What the fuck does she think she's doing?
She's got your gun. Who told you to bring a gun?
Just let me drill, man.
Empty?
Come on, man.
Bearer bonds.
One second.
Two, three, four, five....
Meg. Why are we doing this?
Because it's going to come to that.
There's 22.
$22 million.
That lying little shit!
Let's get out of here.
Lift.
Leave that. Christ, I'll buy you new tools.
You'll be okay.
It's glass. I got you. Come on.
Hurry up.
Watch the glass.
Get down here.
Wait.
Wait. You don't want to do that.
Dad, don't shoot him!
Let my daughter go.
We're finished. Your daughter's fine.
We'll go out the back door. You'll never see us again.
Let her go.
Okay.
It's okay.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Just let her go. Let her go.
Just let her go. Let her go. Let go of her!
Put that gun down.
-Sarah, come here. -Put that gun down!
-Sarah, come here. -Put that gun down! -Do as I say. -Don't be crazy, man.
-Do as I say. -Don't be crazy, man.
-Just let her go. -Let her go!
-Are you okay? -Yes.
-Did they hurt you? -No.
-Did they touch you? -No.
Stephen, shoot him. Shoot him!
Get off her!
You'll be okay now.
-Police! -Don't move!
-Nobody move! -Everybody on the ground!
Team two, upstairs. Team three, down.
Are you okay?
Are you all right?
Freeze! Don't move, motherfucker!
Don't move! I will kill you!
Move away from the wall!
Get off the fence! Move!
Put your hands in the air!
It'll be okay. It's fine, Dad.
Is there anybody else in the house?
No.
Central, I need a bus at 38 West 94th.
It's okay. I'm all right.
I want to see the palms of your hands!
Do you hear me? Open your hands!
Dad, it's okay. You're going to be fine.
Everything is going to be fine.
This sounds interesting.
"Two-bedroom with den or third bedroom...
"...new kitchen, original bath, 70s East."
I thought you liked the West Side.
"61st and Central Park West.
"Bank foreclosure, must sell, luxury doorman building, health club...
-"...conserg--" -Concierge.
-What's that? -It's French for "superintendent."
What's W.E.A. mean? That's West End Avenue.
"81st and West End Avenue.
"Three bedrooms plus den or fourth bedroom, spacious living room...
"...cathedral windows--"
Do we need all that space?
How about this?
"West 83rd, two-bedroom, doorman building...
We changed the material of the cockpit frame.
It's stronger now. No safety loss.
I should hope not! Who'd make it more dangerous?
-Why wasn't I informed of this? -Well, you wanted it ten days sooner.
Blame it on Char and his Neo Zeon.
We wouldn't be rushing through this
if he hadn't decided to drop an asteroid on Earth.
-This it? -Yes.
What are we accused of, anyway?
Kidnapping a minor!
You punks shouldn't be fooling around here on Earth anyway.
You're Quess Paraya, aren't you?
-Get in. We have to hurry. -How dare you!
Come on, Quess!
Darling, she bit me! Quess bit my hand!
Did you, Quess?
-Take a look at this! -We'd better get going.
-I know, but… -Come on.
Have a safe trip Mr. Adenauer.
What was that about?
Just the family life of a top Earth Federation government official.
They figure she'll behave better if they take her out into space.
But that wasn't his wife, was it?
Why can't we travel on a military plane?
The military's been mobilized.
It's safer for us to take a civilian flight from Hong Kong.
Why couldn't you stop Char's plans of putting Earth in a deep-freeze?
The Federation Government didn't believe that Char Aznable was still alive.
There are ten billion people living in outer space.
You think you really know them even though you're on Earth.
That's harder to believe.
Nevertheless…
-Where is it? -In direct line with the North Star!
Give me the coordinates!
It's no use! Pull back!
Five, four, three, two, one… Ignition!
Lieutenant Amuro!
Fifth is accelerating towards Earth!
Entry angle of Fifth, check.
Speed, check.
Is Captain Char on the mobile suit deck?
Yes. He's in the Sazabi.
Captain, Gyunei Guss' unit is in a deadlock.
I think we need to offer support.
We've done what's required to send Fifth Luna to Earth.
Signal all units to withdraw.
I have. But we're unable to emit Minovsky particles
I have. But we're unable to emit Minovsky particles to prevent them from detecting our mobile suits.
And that puts Gyunei in danger. Right.
We'll back up Gyunei's Jagd-Doga and bring him in!
Sazabi is cleared for takeoff! Launch Sazabi!
I can't believe we couldn't stop this asteroid from crashing to Earth.
More reinforcements. Char?
Captain!
That was a mine.
The Minovsky particles have thinned out.
Why are you crashing this to Earth?
Temperatures will drop and it'll become uninhabitable!
It'll cause a nuclear winter!
Those living on Earth care only about themselves.
So I've decided to get rid of them all.
You have no right to punish them that way!
It is Char Aznable's destiny to enforce discipline, Amuro!
-You're full of yourself! -I'm saying Earth isn't going to last.
Not with that!
Captain! Why aren't you using your funnels?
Captain! Don't worry about me!
-Gyunei, you're coming with me. -I can make it back on my own!
You're not fooling anyone.
You did well protecting the nuclear thrusters on Fifth.
But this is a valid ticket.
I'm sorry.
Are you ready, sir?
Forget it. There's no way I'm going with her.
I'd rather freeze here on Earth.
Good idea.
I can't take this!
-Kathy… -Come on. Let's go! Right.
This is the letter from the Federation Government.
All right. Make it two.
Yes, sir. Two tickets.
-You there. -Yes?
-Their letter of recommendation? -Yes.
It's from John Bauer of the Federation Government.
-Let one of them on board. -Sir?
We jumped in line with my political privileges.
Besides, I owe Bauer a favor.
Politicians are all the same.
Ma'am! We can take one of you.
I'll put two on the next shuttle.
But there might not be a next shuttle.
That's true. According to the news, the war's broken out.
Then I'm going to send him.
Hathaway Noa. -Destination is Londenion, right? -Yes.
-Destination is Londenion, right? -Yes. His father's stationed there. Hathaway.
His father's stationed there. Hathaway.
Here. The shuttle will be departing soon.
-But Mom… -You're a big boy now.
It's time you experienced space.
-What about you and Cheimin? -We're okay.
This war won't last very long.
As this man says, we'll catch up in no time.
You sure?
Of course.
I'm taking the Re-GZ for a checkup.
-Thanks, Chief Hanan. -Sir!
Side 2 hasn't started their attack yet?
I know. They're slow.
You don't think Side 1 will assist the Londo Bell unit?
They're afraid their colonies might rebel.
It's here! A heat source!
Side 2 has commenced their laser attack.
But there are too few of them.
They won't be able to destroy it.
It's continuing its descent toward Earth!
Have they issued a warning about Fifth Luna's descent?
To those in Lhasa, Tibet?
The people in charge fled before informing the public.
That's exactly why Char has the upper hand.
Anyway… Char needed a lot of energy to propel Fifth Luna.
How did he get all that nuclear power?
The Federation Government?
-Hard ascent now! -Laser attack's letting up.
Justice!
Long live Neo Zeon!
We're clear for takeoff.
But Vice-Minister, we'll be coming close to an asteroid.
That's a risk I'll take. Just get us to Londenion on time.
-We'll wear our normal suits. -Right.
-Thank you. -Sure.
What's wrong? -No! A fireball! -What?
Captain! Steer us to the right!
-There it is. -It's further north than I expected.
You've got to go further right!
Captain! Further to the right!
Stay seated!
Please dear God!
How pathetic.
We were powerless to stop Char.
-I'm going to the moon! -Amuro!
-Astonaige! Did you prepare the sled? -It's outside and ready to go!
All the colonies have been inspected over the last two years.
How was Char able to build an army without us knowing?
The Federation Government rules the space colonies from Earth. But many Spacenoids resent that.
The colonies aren't exactly honest with us when Londo Bell arrives for an inspection.
There won't be a second wave. I'm heading out.
If all goes well, I might defeat Char before he gets to Sweetwater.
Anaheim makes mobile suits for Neo Zeon too!
-Is it true? -Come on, give us a break.
The technical division has nothing to do with that.
I suppose that's how a corporation works.
Mr. October refused to believe I'm a crew member on the Ra-Cailum.
-You're too cute to be a soldier, Chan. -You mean it?
There's a psycommu receiver pack behind the seat.
-Will the monitor work? -Sure.
Good.
If the psycommu lets us read the enemy's brainwaves better,
it'll speed up our reaction time.
Lieutenant, our R&D division took that idea of yours
Lieutenant, our R&D division took that idea of yours and built it right into the frame.
-Right into the frame? -Yes.
-Right into the frame? -Yes. These computer chips are about the size of metal particles.
These computer chips are about the size of metal particles.
-They're integrated into the frame. -That's a pretty good idea.
And so we used it for this cockpit frame.
But you said you don't know the specifics of this technology?
Just the information from R&D.
We'd like to test the frame when we return to our unit.
I understand.
I'm taking Nu Gundam back with me right now.
We need three more days to equip it for battle.
-Unacceptable. -Not good enough.
The operation to drop Fifth Luna
marks the first major battle of the Neo Zeon fleet.
It has given me the opportunity to observe you in action.
I'm impressed.
We concluded our mission today with diversionary operations
against the pursuing Londo Bell unit.
It's a simple plan.
I wish you success before our triumphant return to Sweetwater.
Thank you!
That was first-rate.
I feel like a total clown.
As the leader of Neo Zeon, you must maintain your public image.
Captain!
I apologize for what happened on Fifth Luna!
We've cyber-enhanced you at the Newtype Labs.
It cost quite a lot. We can't afford to lose you.
-Don't worry about it. Get ready. -Right!
-Don't worry about it. Get ready. -Right! Newtype Labs Director…
I mean, Operations Officer!
Lieutenant Nanai, is Gyunei fit to go with us?
He's a bit oversensitive,
but his skills as a guard are excellent.
The scenery at the colony will calm him.
-Do you think we overdid the enhancements? -He's just young.
Captain, if I may…
You are the leader of Neo Zeon.
That's why I'm getting ready to act like a politician.
-Take care of the operation. -Yes, Captain.
-The enemy is moving. -What are they up to?
They're between the moon and Side 1. Damn that Char!
They're between the moon and Side 1. Damn that Char! What are they after?
Anaheim should be monitoring our actions.
-Get Amuro! -Yes, sir!
Combat bridge, get a move on!
What is it?
From the Ra-Cailum.
Char's second wave is close to the moon?
They want me back in Londo Bell right away?
I'll tune the psycommu receiver later. -What? -Are you going?
-What? -Are you going? But we're not done…
-Here. -You're going?
-I'm turning it on. -It won't work!
I'll find a way.
Amuro…
Do it.
Okay.
Chan! The Booster Bed and…
-The Mass Driver, right? -Right!
This operation makes no sense.
Mobile suits are designed for close combat.
Get moving, Rezin!
It's not like you follow orders anyway!
Whatever.
Don't do it! You won't make it in time!
We're going.
I warned you!
Launch trajectory set! SSE, standing by for orders!
Looks good on you.
Just part of my duty.
SSE here.
The mobile suits will begin combat shortly.
-That'll be your signal to launch. -Roger!
-Any time now. -Yes.
-Any time now. -Yes. Main bridge, watch for the signal.
Countdown progressing!
Mr. October!
Don't forget to send the psycommu frame sample to Londo Bell!
I'll forward it! Zero!
We still can't use the Re-GZ?
It won't be repaired in time!
I know that.
Chan.
Chan?
Please come back.
Keep firing! Three more seconds!
All fleets, commence evasive action!
Now's our chance to squash a few.
Found you.
One of them got past our mobile suits!
-Counterattack! Barrage! -Barrage!
Close the bulkheads! Fire, team!
The Moon, Earth… Capella, Vega, the Sun…
We must be right here.
And the fleet…
Hey, Chan.
You okay?
Yes. Where's the fleet?
-Has it started? -Yeah.
-I'll get behind you. -Thanks.
See that? Those lights over there!
Change course! There's a battle over there!
Damn!
Get the Apogee Motors fixed, or we'll head straight into it!
No way!
Oh, God!
I'm on it!
Where are the Jegan teams?
The barrage is thinning out!
That's Kayra's machine!
Kayra! Do you read me?
You'll be hit with friendly fire! Get out!
The Lieutenant's not here!
Pretty good. Now hold still!
What?
Reinforcements?
There!
It's a new machine.
Neo Zeon?
Take a look for yourself.
Is it war?
Looks like it.
Signal to pull back!
A Gundam?
-They're pulling back. -What?
It's almost like they planned for this.
Something isn't right…
The rest of the ship is off-limits!
Stay in the officers' mess hall.
Try to keep your feet on the floor. Go on.
Hathaway? Dad!
Hey…
You were on the shuttle?
But why?
I didn't know you were the captain of this ship.
Where's your mom and Cheimin?
They only let one of us on the shuttle.
Captain. Sorry to break up the family reunion, but…
Oh, he's the one who got me on the shuttle.
I see. -You must be the Vice-Minister. -Yes.
You'll have to redirect this ship to Londenion.
I'm on a special mission.
Hathaway, go to the mess hall.
We'll discuss this later.
Sure.
Lalah Sune?
You can't keep both Char and me for yourself!
It would be agony to live on forever after death.
I just want to watch over the both of you.
That's just selfish!
I want to stay with the both of you, until the end of time.
Forget about Char!
Char is pure.
Pure?
Damn it! I thought I'd stopped having those dreams.
Lieutenant.
-What is it? -Could you come to the mobile suit deck?
-I'll be there in ten! -Thanks.
What's wrong with him? He sounded angry.
Chan.
I got hit?
That's what happened, Quess Paraya.
The controls are too big for my hands.
They're the right size for normal suits.
Can I try it now?
This is great.
They've already come up with a CG simulation
using footage from the last battle.
It's a military secret, so don't tell anyone.
I think she's got good instincts.
Well, I had no idea she had any interest in this.
Two-faced hypocrite.
-Quess Paraya? -Yes!
Civilians should stay clear of this area.
Oh, sorry.
Quess!
You'll get in the way. Come back.
Go on ahead!
He just doesn't get it.
Over here! Amuro!
Here! Right. What's the problem?
So that's Amuro Ray.
"Over here," my foot.
Quess! I shot down two enemies!
Really? I got two too!
Didn't you feel anything?
He seemed like any other grownup.
-Here. -Thanks.
But they say he instinctively knew how to pilot a mobile suit from the get-go.
He even took out Zeon's Zakus.
Think it's true?
As soon as he got in the cockpit, he understood how the Gundam worked.
What's so funny?
And that makes him a Newtype?
Yes, exactly.
That's not what Christina, my friend in India, said.
She says Newtypes can understand people and objects on a fundamental level.
She said there's a spiritual connection, no matter how far away they may be.
Yeah. Back when humans only lived on Earth, we only used half our brain cells.
Back when humans only lived on Earth, we only used half our brain cells.
But then we went into space, and we started using the remaining half.
That must be how we developed telepathy and precognition.
Otherwise, families living apart in space and on Earth
would lose their connection to each other.
Your family must get along pretty well.
But my dad still gets on my nerves.
My family's always lived on Earth, but it doesn't seem to help.
We're on target, thanks to the code the Federation provided.
They're pretty careless with their information.
Not at all, Captain.
We had to pull a lot of strings.
I know.
That must be the new mobile suit.
This area is off limits to civilians.
They let me in here before.
What about you? Why are you here?
What? What do you mean? I'm a mechanic on this ship.
You grown-ups always miss the point.
That's not what I meant.
-What's your relationship with Amuro? -Relationship?
He's my senior officer, and I look up to him.
You still don't get it.
I studied in India
about how all of us can become Newtypes and understand each other.
That's why I'm interested in Amuro, who everyone says is a Newtype.
Why must you interfere?
Interfere?
That's the way I see it! Get off this ship! Now!
I can't do that.
-Do it, or I'll-- -Quess! That area's off-limits!
Get lost!
Grab this!
-Quess! There's the colony. -Colony?
Side 1's Londenion.
There's a city inside a cylinder.
With lakes, too.
Makes you believe in the possibility of human evolution.
I can see why the Zabis fought for independence.
But the Zabi family lost to the Federation, right?
Yeah, but… My father rules these colonies from Earth, but he knows nothing about them.
My father rules these colonies from Earth, but he knows nothing about them.
Which explains why Char is now bent on destroying Earth,
even though he actually switched sides to protect it not too long ago.
Well, I'm with him.
People on Earth are stubborn and conservative,
but don't have a problem changing wives and husbands.
That's why I think Char is doing whatever he can
to bring out the potential in humanity.
I'm not so sure.
Does that give him the right to freeze Earth?
I don't know…
Do you think Char will go through with this plan to freeze the Earth?
He's already started the process.
He has to crash another asteroid onto Earth if he wants a total Ice Age.
But the Federation Forces control everything within moon's orbit.
That's why he's pushing to get Sweetwater recognized as Neo Zeon territory.
Is Adenauer Paraya here for the negotiations?
Yeah, I believe so.
Char once joined our fight against the Federation Forces,
but he discovered the truth about the bigwigs who live on Earth,
and that was the final straw.
Yes, I realize that.
Now he wants to settle everything, once and for all.
"Everything"?
I'm relieved you got us here in time.
Thanks to that, Earth can be saved.
Good luck with your negotiations, sir.
Negotiations? With whom? Where?
You command the Space Forces from Lhasa.
I find it unlikely you came here just to sightsee.
No one must know I'm here.
Not until the Federation Government makes an official announcement.
See ya!
Welcome, sir.
I'm Cameron Bloom from the Audit Bureau.
-Thank you. -Be careful now!
-Thank you. -Be careful now! Ta-dah!
-Quess! -Crew dismissed!
Captain Bright Noa, huh?
I wonder how things are going with Mirai.
There's a lot of work to do!
The sample frame from Mr. October arrived.
Oh, good.
Can we see the inside of the colony from here?
Sure we can.
I think that new frame is a good idea.
That Adenauer Paraya…
He gave the Londo Bell orders to find the remnants of Zeon…
but he's been talking to Char all this time.
That's what politicians do.
-Is that acceptable? -Good question.
-Is that acceptable? -Good question. The colony!
That's right. This is an old city with about five million people.
This is an old city with about five million people.
You're usually warm and gentle, like right now.
But sometimes you're distant and angry.
-You think so? -I do.
Thank you for coming.
Our pleasure. Welcome to Londenion.
These are Neo Zeon people!
-You don't mind me taking Amuro? -That's fine.
We spend a lot of time together when you're not around.
Hathaway!
Dad!
Tell her not to bother me about asking you out on a date.
Quess?
There you are!
They wouldn't let me call the battleship directly.
I'm really sorry I had to bug the captain.
That's okay.
-Is that right? -Yeah.
Has he been re-charged?
Yes! Bring him out.
Sure! You mean Haro?
-Drake Hotel? -Mr. Amuro…
The Supreme Leader is here?
As this is a favor to us, it's only natural to have our top official here as a matter of courtesy.
to have our top official here as a matter of courtesy.
Your presence puts our minds at ease. Thank you.
That's good to hear.
I trust the treaty document is genuine?
Of course.
Our government moved its HQ before Fifth Luna hit Lhasa
and put together an official document.
What treaty?
If you accept the conditions of the treaty,
we will hand over the asteroid Axis to Neo Zeon.
What?
Haro!
Haro!
Hathaway! Yes?
I heard about Haro from my mother.
-He's third generation. Look after him. -Of course!
So you want us to surrender the Neo Zeon fleet to Luna II first…
or we can't move Axis to Sweetwater, is that right?
Unless you agree to the conditions, I can see no peace between us.
Gold bars… What's this?
Please review our payment for Axis.
-He's from the Audit Bureau. -Sir!
With this exchange, we have officially purchased Axis.
But we would like to use our fleet to transport Axis to Sweetwater.
Why is that?
We're not in a position to give severance pay to the fleet crew who will lose their jobs.
I see. That's a problem.
Very well, then.
We'll find them work within the Federation Forces.
The nuclear engines in Axis are fully operational, so transport shouldn't be a problem.
so transport shouldn't be a problem.
You mean the old engines can still be used?
That's a relief!
If you'll excuse me…
Bunch of snobs.
If the Londo Bell scoundrels were to find out we're here,
they wouldn't take it so well.
Indeed.
Amuro, I'm doing something extremely wicked.
If you're nearby, feel my presence.
-I'm not going into the city. -Sir!
-Sieg Zeon. -Sieg Zeon.
Sieg Zeon.
Awesome!
Chase that swan over there, Amuro!
You!
What's the matter, sir?
-Get Gyunei for me! -Yes, sir!
What are you doing here?
Unlike you, I'm more than just a pilot!
What?
So that's Char…
We fought together, Char! Why do you want to destroy Earth?
The people on Earth do nothing but pollute it.
Their souls are weighed down by gravity.
So that's why even married couples fight each other.
Char!
Why?
Earth can't live with all those parasites!
We can find a solution for that!
Then grant all those ignorant fools the wisdom to do so!
He's right! Because it can't be done…
I'll do that, but after I get rid of you!
-Amuro! You're not fighting fair! -Quess!
Shall we go?
-Char! -Quess!
Captain!
Quess!
Quess!
Hathaway…
Char!
Sorry to bother you…
I thought it might be you, Mr. Cameron.
Thank you.
What does the Audit Bureau want with me?
What does the Audit Bureau want with me? How is Mirai? Oh, excuse me…
How is Mirai? Oh, excuse me… How is your wife doing?
I haven't seen her in six months.
She's been on Earth this whole time.
I see. Is something the matter?
I didn't know who to talk to.
Char is in this colony right now.
What's that?
Char Aznable met with Federation officials here.
With Adenauer Paraya?
He wasn't the only one, though. There were several others.
They believe they reached a binding peace agreement with Char.
That's…
You've got good taste! How much for the girl?
Cut out the smart remarks. The girl's spoken for.
They're all here.
Good, just in time.
We're heading out into space. What do you wish to do, Quess?
Report on the Federation Forces?
Still no movement.
Some hag on the Ra-Cailum cramps my style.
Is that so? Well, then…
-What is it? -You don't know what Char's up to!
What's wrong with selling the Axis asteroid?
The money will be used to improve our welfare policies!
Besides, Char said he'd attack the colonies if we don't sell it to him!
He'd never harm the colonies.
Char wants to wipe out those who remain on Earth.
I'm going to Luna II to prepare for Neo Zeon's disarmament.
Disarm their fleet?
Why won't you engage Londo Bell to oversee it?
Careful, sir.
-May I borrow a phone? -Yes, sir.
We can't have Char's fleet near a colony.
Vice-Minister.
Then we will act independently to monitor the situation.
Yes, of course!
You may engage the enemy if you think Earth is in danger.
Now where did Quess run off to?
Captain, pass on a message for me.
Tell her to remain at the hotel for a few days.
Yes, sir.
I'm closing it.
I'm floating.
-You use these to-- -Yes, I know.
It's a bit older than the Jegan, but I know.
-Are you sure? -Let me try!
-Wow! -Bring the SSE in front of you.
Is this really your first time?
Watch this! A forward flip!
What? Is that Quess?
Yes. Looks like she's a natural.
The Musaka's ready to pick us up.
Vroom! Stop!
What's that?
-Don't approach until they say so. -It's okay!
Quit it for my sake!
There are already people out there who hate me
because I'm from the Newtype Labs.
Leave those fools to me.
You must have had some terrible memories for you to hate Earth…
Quess Air?
Why were you drawn to me?
You said that the human soul was weighed down by gravity.
That's exactly how I feel.
But you know… I think those who truly understand that must lead tragic lives.
I think those who truly understand that must lead tragic lives.
I'm just walking the path I believe in.
I saw a swan fly.
Amuro shouted, and then I shouted, too.
Then you appeared right after that.
Is that why you betrayed Amuro and the others?
I met them by coincidence.
I wasn't really friends with them or anything.
It's hard to get an operator's license for space.
If I work at the Colony PC, I'll never run out of colony repair jobs.
I just need training.
You want it on a 50-month loan, right?
Ouch!
That's after only four or five tries. -She's the real thing. -That's right.
-She's the real thing. -That's right. Quess' brainwaves sync perfectly with the psycommu.
-Quess, you know your target? -Yes, ma'am.
The funnels will automatically advance to the mark. Okay!
-Deploy the funnels. -Yes, ma'am.
You mean I can control those with just my brainwaves?
Picture the target.
Picture it?
Go! Funnels!
Next, order the funnels to attack.
Order the funnels?
That's it! Funnels!
Just like her.
Would you mind?
Here.
For the leader. For the Captain?
-From over there, to you. -Thank you.
Sieg Zeon!
-Sieg Zeon! -Sieg Zeon!
-Sieg Zeon! -Sieg Zeon!
High hopes and noble endeavors Will shine with all the twinkling stars
Will shine with all the twinkling stars We hold you next to us
The galaxy, so glorious
The galaxy, so glorious We'll build with our dreams
A new world that bravely shines
Char is fighting for our prayers
Char is fighting for our prayers
Wow, you're the real deal!
-Is that funny? -No.
So you're going to destroy Earth?
Destroy? Not at all.
I'm just giving it a nice long rest.
Oh, I get it now.
Did the training give you any headaches?
No, I'm fine!
Gyunei. I'm relying on you for tomorrow's operation.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure about this? Tomorrow's operation is no field trip.
You bet!
Captain…
Get some rest tonight. Go.
Ramming Axis into Earth
will leave the planet in a state similar to that of a nuclear winter.
That's an evil scheme no dictator in history has ever attempted.
Are you okay with that, Captain Char?
It's too late for lectures, Nanai.
I believe that humanity will evolve, now that we live in space.
However, in order to turn all of us into Newtypes…
someone has to shoulder all the evils of humanity.
And you're okay with that?
You thought up this latest plan…
to get even with Amuro, right?
Do you think I'd be so petty?
Amuro Ray thinks compassion is a Newtype weapon, but he's wrong.
A woman may forgive his delusions.
But you cannot forgive that about Amuro.
During the War for Zeon's independence…
I had a protégé, a young pilot named Lalah Sune.
She found compassion in Amuro, even though he was the enemy.
That deep mutual understanding is only possible between Newtypes.
Lalah! Amuro!
Lalah! Stop playing around with him!
-Captain, no! -What?
If only my sister Artesia hadn't been there…
-Oh, no! -Lalah!
Lalah…
I wanted her to guide me.
I needed her to tell me what I was feeling…
What's the matter?
Those who are too much alike will end up hating each other.
They say love and hate are two sides of the same coin.
I suppose so.
I'm counting on you for tomorrow's operation.
I'll go on ahead to Axis and wait for you there.
Are you sure about Quess?
I don't see the need for further enhancements.
I agree.
She's a Newtype that doesn't need a psycho-frame to control funnels.
Yes, she is special.
And I was so sure he'd changed his ways after taking up his father's mantle.
Damn!
How could he fall for such a brat?
The war is just an outlet for him to take out his frustrations.
What do you mean?
When people like the Captain get angry, they start destroying colonies.
Someone's got to be there to prevent that.
That's why I had them cyber-enhance me into a Newtype.
Both my parents died when their colony was wiped out.
Dirty perverts!
-So you want to be an esper? -Yeah.
But I now realize the Newtype Lab enhancements
will never get me to your level.
So I want to be with you and study you for as long as it takes.
-You asking me out? -Are you bothered about my age?
I get it! You're jealous, right? Because I like the Captain?
That's not it!
Quess!
Let's get him!
Stop it!
That's not fair!
So there won't be any shuttles for the time being?
The shuttle company plans to leave Hong Kong.
Is the news about a peace treaty a lie?
I hear Hong Kong is the next target.
-Will an asteroid hit Earth? -Char would do it.
I know because I fought against him a long time ago.
People on Earth don't know what they're doing.
Char is just too much of a perfectionist.
Colony Sweetwater was built
by fusing a closed-type and open-type colony together.
It is extremely unstable.
It was constructed in haste to accommodate the refugees
from the previous space wars.
This was the only measure taken by the Earth Federation.
They concluded that this would suffice.
They remained on Earth and refused to share the planet.
My father, Zeon Deikun, had made a request to Earth
for autonomy for all space emigrants, also known as "Spacenoids."
But he was assassinated by the Zabi Family!
The Zabis called themselves the Principality of Zeon
and launched a war of independence against Earth!
You know how it ended, with the Zabis losing the war.
Fine and well.
But the Earth government had grown arrogant.
The Federation Forces had become corrupt from within,
The Federation Forces had become corrupt from within, giving rise to the Titans
and Haman, who claimed succession to the Zabis!
This is why we have so many refugees!
I know all of that.
I have come to believe
that we must do everything to prevent war from happening again!
This is the true purpose behind our operation to drop Axis onto Earth!
As such, we will discipline those who continue to live on Earth
and eliminate the source of all wars within the Earth's sphere!
Captain!
You're the savior of Sweetwater!
But aren't they disarming themselves at Luna II?
Everyone! So that we may forge our own path…
and establish a government for the refugees
I ask you to lend me your great strength for just a little longer!
When we've succeeded, I will then be able to join my father, Zeon!
The Rewloola, right?
Do you think they'll be fooled by these dummy ships?
As long as the Federation sees the correct number of ships.
Our fleet with the dummies are to attack Luna II.
And you will occupy Axis while all this is transpiring, Captain.
If all goes well, we'll use the nuclear weapons from Luna II.
Right. Both to accelerate Axis, and to contaminate the Earth.
Both to accelerate Axis, and to contaminate the Earth.
How many nuclear weapons from past centuries are stored at Luna II?
There's enough payload to annihilate the Neo Zeon fleet a hundred times over.
Char is aware of that fact. He's a very clever man.
Are you implying that our Londo Bell is itching for a war?
I am. It does look that way from Earth.
Vice-Minister. There's a broadcast from Sweetwater.
Put it up.
How's the signal?
Perfect.
Their flagship Rewloola is at the rear.
Numbers match, sir!
Wait! There's one extra vessel!
Shows you how honest Char is.
The only thing left to worry about is space aliens.
I wonder if there'll be any jobs for us when this is over.
They're always looking for people to clean the beaches on Earth.
Bon voyage, our glorious Neo Zeon fleet!
It's difficult for us to part with you.
But we shall keep your memories in our minds and make…
So there were 15 nuclear warheads in addition to the ones in Luna II?
But considering they're under the Audit Bureau's jurisdiction,
I'd say they're virtual antiques.
Please be careful.
Aren't your actions considered a crime?
If the Federation Government survives, I'll get life imprisonment.
You're fine with that?
I want to see Mirai alive. That's why I'm doing this.
You were once her fiancé. I understand.
Thank you.
This Neo Zeon broadcast. Is their claim that the entire fleet has left for disarmament a sham?
Is their claim that the entire fleet has left for disarmament a sham?
Probably. It's all a big show.
That Quess is on my tail!
She's looking good!
-Navigation axle targeting Luna II fixed! -Okay!
-Navigation axle targeting Luna II fixed! -Okay! All gun turrets, maximum elevation!
Bring in the Jagd-Doga.
You kids taking part in the battle?
Problem with that?
A big mouth for a fake Newtype.
I am a real Newtype!
Gyunei. Forget it.
Just ignore those "normal people."
-Rezin! -Stop it!
Well, I guess you're not normal.
-That's right. -How cute.
Bring in Alpha-Azieru!
Fire the grappling cables!
Neo Zeon fleet confirmed.
Numbers same as when they left Sweetwater.
Captain! Why hasn't this vessel moved up to the front?
We're insulting Char!
I must first consider the safety of officials like yourself!
The fleet's spreading out laterally.
They're supposed to approach single file.
Scout team, launch!
We'll commence our attack.
Yes, sir!
Launch mobile suits 30 seconds after commencing barrage.
Numerous heat sources!
-What? -Evade!
But the treaty! This is crazy!
Hey, Quess! Just get a feel for the battle.
Follow me.
Okay.
Wow…
Here they come.
I'll take care of all these guys on my own.
They're here.
-Gyunei! -Damn it!
This is war, huh? Gyunei…
Go away!
Our objective is to capture Luna II.
Quess!
There's another one hiding over there!
We've got to escape!
Our soldiers are losing their lives!
They're here!
The enemy?
Down you go!
I did it!
Watch out! Quess!
That damage won't cause an explosion. You're safe.
Take this.
I'll wipe out the Federation on my own.
Quess! Are you all right?
Why…
Why do I feel so weird?
We won without moving to the combat bridge.
Now we can deliver Luna II's nukes to the Captain.
That'll keep us busy.
Captain, your plan worked flawlessly.
Stop your crying.
Oh, Cameron. I'll leave him with you now.
He must get that from Mirai. So sensitive.
Goodbye. I pray that Luna II hasn't been wiped out.
Who knows?
My big sob act sure got me out of there.
Check hull seals!
Good thing I studied the ship's layout.
We have a problem with hatch 48!
What's that?
Problem corrected!
Maintenance! Check out hatch 48!
-What's going on? -Beats me.
I'm going to test it!
Stop fooling around.
-Move it to the airlock. -Roger!
-Captain. -What is it?
-Don't you find it strange? -What?
Two fleets left Luna II and Londenion.
Leaving at the same time, we should arrive at Axis first.
Why would Char be that foolish?
But all their ships are at Luna II right now, even an extra one.
Exactly.
What's up?
-Sweetwater's broadcast was a hoax. -What?
Look here.
They don't show us any close-ups
and I can't see any gun barrels.
They're dummy ships.
-Which means… -Char has already made it to Axis.
Okay! Mobile suit forces, go and scout out Axis!
-Lyle! I'm going, too. -Yes, sir!
If Axis hits Earth with all those Luna II warheads…
those elite snobs are goners.
But the Londo Bell fleet may arrive at Axis before we do.
That may be so, but…
What?
We're on combat alert, and you're wearing that?
Stay out of here!
I'm just taking a walk!
Everybody's on edge while we're on combat alert.
You're right.
This isn't a playground!
Don't touch me!
Quess!
Get into your pilot suit, and stand by at the assigned station.
We haven't heard from Hathaway.
The microwave signals must be busy with emergency calls.
Mom said it's about time I get space experience.
I have to hold out a bit longer, or they'll dump me in a colony.
Looks good!
Good! Now, I can finish off Char by myself!
Please stop talking that way!
I'm worried you'll get yourself hurt.
Astonaige! You silly man.
Identifying fleet! They're Federation vessels!
Was it a surprise attack?
Everyone on the main bridge was lost, including Adenauer Paraya.
What about Char's fleet?
They broke into Luna II's nuclear weapons cache.
The colony fleets won't help us.
They're afraid of riots breaking out.
It's as if the colonies and Earth were helping Char!
Not all of Neo Zeon's vessels are gathered at Axis!
-I'm going! -Quess!
What are you going to do?
I can't stand that woman!
She's a woman who earned her position because she's so close with the Captain!
I'm going to ask him about that!
Don't get too close to the Captain!
I don't want to hear about your jealousy!
I'm not jealous!
Open the hatch!
Nanai… It's up to you.
Get that damaged Jagd-Doga out of here!
Prepare to fire decoy missiles!
Preparing to fire missiles!
Control will then be transferred to the combat bridge!
Minovsky particles at combat density!
All hands, prepare for visual combat!
Activate monitoring systems!
First wave of missiles, launch!
-All hands, prepare for launch! -Everyone in your team here?
-What the… -Follow Kayra's Re-GZ!
-Haro! -Where's your normal suit?
You want to suffocate?
-Amuro… -Hathaway!
Amuro…
I'll take care of this.
You'll be leading the first wave. You'd better go.
You'll be leading the first wave. You'd better go. Right.
Opening hatch in five minutes!
Check normal suits!
Second wave now! Go!
-Second wave, fire! -Roger!
Heat sources approaching!
Prepare for counterattack! Open combat bridge!
Contact the Captain!
They've finally come, huh?
Get ready for ignition when you're done with the pulse thrusters.
Please hold them back for another ten minutes.
Roger that.
They're later than I expected.
Launch attack from the north side of Axis!
Watch for friendly fire!
Is that it?
Destroy them!
A nuclear warhead amongst their missiles…
Not bad, Londo Bell.
Second wave's coming!
Your mother and sister
would be worried sick if they knew you're in the battlefield!
-That's not a bad thing for a boy. -It's no joke!
You want to see Quess don't you, Hathaway?
I'm going to get her back!
Hathaway…
-We're launching at once. -Right.
Char is taking advantage of Quess' very sensitive nature.
You won't beat him.
Taking advantage of her?
Char is enhancing her abilities.
And now she's become one of his tools.
No…
Char can't change the world without sacrificing the lives of others.
It won't end well for Quess.
She won't be able to break free from the influence of the dead.
Quess will not die!
I'll bring her back!
That's why I learned how to pilot a mobile suit!
With an attitude like that, you'll meet death yourself.
First wave mobile suits to launch immediately,
following fourth wave missiles!
Kayra!
I'll make your favorite salad.
I love you.
Kayra in Re-GZ, taking off!
What did you say?
The second wave is here.
Mobile suit forces, go above the minefield.
Time to go, Axis.
Take your dreadful memories with you!
Still more?
Beautiful!
Axis engines firing up!
Commencing descent to Earth!
Launch fifth wave of missiles! Fire!
All hands, level one battle stations!
Release dummy ships!
Prepare evasive maneuvers!
I'll use the intercom if I need to speak to you.
-Okay. -Hey, what's that thing?
It's a psycho-frame.
I'm doing tests to learn its capabilities.
Go on.
Just one nuclear missile among them?
Impressive, Bright.
Nanai. Hurry over here.
If you don't want Quess hurt,
stick with her until she finds Captain Char. -Yes, ma'am! -Captain.
-Yes, ma'am! -Captain. Let him go.
We're about to enter the Axis combat zone. Yes, sir.
I don't care what anyone says.
There's no way I'll lose Quess to the Captain!
This heat source is Axis.
On the left, a nuclear explosion.
There're so many dummies, I can't count their ships.
Then burn those dummies!
That's Axis over there.
The Captain's there!
Captain…
Heat source to starboard! Enemy!
Reinforcements from Luna II?
Second wave, launch now. Support forces will cover the fleet.
That's good.
Gundam, moving out!
Continue cover fire for another 30 seconds.
Going by the book?
I wish you the best.
Thanks.
Will their fleet intercept us before we destroy the nuclear thrusters?
We've got to stop Axis!
Those lights.
Are you somewhere within those circles of light?
Quess is over there!
-Don't be stupid, Quess! -Gyunei…
The mobile suits are engaged in battle north of Axis!
Okay. Sixth wave! This is it! Don't miss!
Londo Bell, huh? Should have stuck to ringing bells.
You're getting on my nerves.
There he is! Captain! Why are you hiding over there?
Captain! Why are you hiding over there?
Quess.
Londo Bell mobile suits?
Missiles?
They're nuclear missiles!
Funnels.
Aim at the most intense heat sources.
Hit them!
All right!
Incredible…
Captain!
Gyunei halted the enemy nukes for us.
That's what a cyber-Newtype is supposed to do.
Captain! Nanai slapped me real hard!
I do hate violence. I'll talk to Nanai myself. Quess?
Quess, you're not wearing a normal suit.
Will you really? Make sure she's punished.
Don't worry.
Then, I'll do my job!
-Calm down. -But…
You haven't felt the terror of real-life combat.
-Terror? -Yeah.
I felt kind of strange. That's about it.
It isn't fair.
Nanai wasn't very nice to me.
So you came to see me, right?
Captain!
Those feelings of yours.
You could be a true Newtype.
Good girl.
I found it!
They just got my fringe.
I feel a pressure from above-left.
A Gundam?
A dummy! There!
This one is a real rock!
Go around the rocks and surround him from both sides!
I'm sure of it! That's a Gundam!
If I destroy it, I'll prove I'm stronger than Captain Char!
There!
Without the remote controls, we'll have to go and shoot!
-Yeah, but… -I'll do it!
Ms. Chan. She sure can tough it out.
What's wrong?
We can't operate them from control!
They're here!
Who cares if they're Newtypes if they can't stop the fleet?
I'm glad you found me.
-A dummy! -Right!
This way!
What is this power?
How could I be hit?
-You did it! -Not yet.
It feels like people are coming into me!
I feel sick and scared!
Quess…
I'll get there first!
That craft! Do you want to wipe out our fleet?
You jerk!
Kayra?
Got you now!
I can get another shot! I want Axis!
I'll get you!
Gundam wannabe!
I've got it! Oh, no!
You've lost all your weapons. I'll grab the Gundam look-alike.
Again!
I'll use this one as bait.
What is it? Stop playing with me.
This pressure again!
The two Gundams. Are they calling each other?
The escape pod…
It won't work!
Stay where you are!
If you disobey me, I'll kill this pilot!
Amuro! The enemy's not moving! Take him out!
The enemy's not moving! Take him out!
Kayra?
Amuro? You're the famous Gundam pilot.
Optical voice?
If you surrender your Gundam, I'll release this pilot to you.
What's wrong? Hurry up!
Once I get that Nu Gundam, I'll have the power to defeat Char.
Then I'll be a man worthy of taking Quess for myself!
Get him!
You're trying to tow me?
Signal your surrender, and toss your rifle!
Don't worry about me…
Stop it! I'll detach my funnels!
Yeah, right! Your radiator plates aren't a threat!
Destroy Amuro!
Again!
Amuro!
Quess?
You're resisting! Amuro!
You're to blame for this. You ignored my warnings!
He has funnels?
Kayra…
I…
Seems the first wave pulled back.
I feel like I'm going to explode.
I feel like I'm going to explode. This girl senses everything on the battlefield.
Don't use up all of our anti-missile particle shells!
Surveillance! Enemy location?
Enemy mobile suits withdrawing!
If you can't land, don't!
Secure them with wires!
-Astonaige! -What?
Kayra! Go to her.
Right!
Bring in the next one!
Astonaige! Stay back!
-Amuro, that's Kayra! -Don't look!
-Amuro, that's Kayra! -Don't look! Kayra!
The funnels were too sensitive.
They acted quickly to protect the Gundam…
I was going to make your favorite salad.
Astonaige…
-Get her out of here! -Yes, sir!
It's partly because I couldn't control the funnels.
But Char started all this.
I'm prepared to give my life to end his.
Amuro, stop talking like that!
Now you know how I feel.
Char's affecting all of us…
So, we won't have any time to test the Alpha-Azieru?
Why don't you have Quess test it in real combat?
I can see you're upset.
Did Quess say something to you?
She told me you're too serious for her to get along with.
How's it coming?
Cruiser 4 will be bringing us the warheads in 30 minutes.
Gyunei's frantic that he's going to lose Quess to you.
If we send them forward together that will bring out his abilities.
She'll be in the Alpha. I can't break a promise.
-I'll abide by whatever you decide. -Is that okay?
If I knew you truly loved me.
I need you here with me, Nanai.
Char Aznable…
Are you tired from having to uphold the Casval Deikun name?
It hasn't been easy taking on my father's name.
I need the support you give me.
Is that it?
The Alpha is already completed?
The Captain told me he's going to let me use it!
You've got to be kidding!
Everyone's being mean to me!
That's not true.
What are you doing?
Weren't you with the Captain?
He's meeting with Nanai.
You think they're just talking business?
The Captain doesn't care about her.
He held me in his arms.
I told you to cool it with him.
Why should I?
You know, I wiped out all of the enemy nukes at once!
I can get more done than the Captain himself.
Forget about that guy!
What are you saying? There's a war going on!
Oh, Quess.
Don't you know why he keeps Nanai by his side?
He said he'll see her only on duty.
I'm fine!
I'm fine! The Captain's obsessed with a young pilot named Lalah who he lost in the One Year War.
The reason the Captain goes out with Nanai is to keep up appearances as our leader.
He's into girls who are far too young for him.
Everyone at the Newtype Lab knows about it.
Yeah, so who cares? She's long gone, right?
Many girls have heard the Captain mumble Lalah's name in his sleep.
Quess…
I'm going to kick Nanai and Lalah out of his life!
He only started this war because Lalah chose Amuro!
I hate young men because they say things like that!
Our remaining fleet will begin a second attack from this point.
But those nuclear weapons in Axis seized from Luna II could still cause a nuclear winter
if they are detonated close to Earth.
So, this time we have to destroy the thrusters on Axis
and then continue to destroy Axis itself.
Which means we have to carry out an all-out attack.
But we only have four nukes left.
If we fail to blast it with those warheads we'll have to sneak into Axis
If we fail to blast it with those warheads we'll have to sneak into Axis and blow up this section from the inside.
There's a network of mining tunnels so it is possible to break Axis apart.
Once that happens, the fragments of Axis will be blown clear of Earth.
Right. That's a three-stage plan.
We must complete it before enemy reinforcements arrive from Luna II.
Everyone. Would you give up your lives?
"That psycho-frame idea…
It wasn't dreamed up within our R&D division after all.
The R&D people aren't positive about this…"
…but they think the technology was provided by Neo Zeon.
That's ridiculous.
The psycho-frame worked.
And the enemy wouldn't share a finished product.
Mr. October…
Why would you send a letter like this with the psycho-frame sample?
-Chan. -Yes?
What's wrong?
Thinking of Kayra and Astonaige.
And you talking about giving up your life. I'm just worried.
I apologize.
Are the funnels okay?
Of course.
I heard that this psycho-frame
can resonate with your psycommu and unleash unknown powers.
Do you believe that?
What October said?
-I doubt it. -But…
I'll win with the Fin Funnels.
I did create the basic design of Nu Gundam and you've been taking care of it.
Yeah, I guess you're right!
Wait right here. I'll go check and see.
Okay.
If we stick around here, we'll be finished if an asteroid hits Hong Kong!
Is it true another asteroid's coming?
I doubt we'll have a nuclear winter.
-Let's take a detour. -What?
We'll have to double back, though.
The sun…
Mom! What's that?
That's Char's asteroid!
Moving objects detected! Possibly the enemy fleet!
All hands, level 1 battle stations!
Are you certain?
I see Cruiser 4 for sure, but…
I see Cruiser 4 for sure, but… We took this before dispersing Minovsky particles.
See the number of lights?
You're saying they're Federation fleets?
From Side 2 and Side 5, and even those that escaped from Luna II.
Deploy the mobile suits to the front! Get the Captain!
Return safely.
You have permission from the Captain.
The combat bridge is off-limits.
But if you can sit still, you're welcome to observe.
Yes, sir!
Write your will on this.
It'll be sent off in a capsule.
Yes, sir.
Add a lock of your hair, too. Okay…
Federation fleets are mobilizing?
No mistake about it.
Nu Gundam, moving out!
Ra-Zyme and Ra-Kiem! You're next!
They're coming from Side 2 and Side 5, but will they back us up?
Inform them of our position periodically.
Mobile suit forces to spread out in advance of the fleet!
102! You're clear!
Captain!
Where did you go?
Am I a substitute for Lalah?
Quess…
Who said that?
I mean, why would that bother you?
I love you, Captain! That's why!
-That's a problem. -Why?
-That's a problem. -Why? I would give my life for you! All right.
All right.
I'll forget about both Lalah and Nanai.
Then I'll protect you with Alpha!
Char!
You even wrote a will for your father. That's good.
Hathaway.
Go down below if you get scared.
Sure, Dad.
What's up? I had a meeting with the Operations Officer.
What made you think I have an interest in Quess?
What do you mean, sir?
Nanai assigned Quess to the Alpha.
-Guard her until she gets used to it. -Yes, sir.
I'm only interested in rebuilding Neo Zeon and defeating Amuro.
-And Nanai's been very nice to me. -Yes, sir.
-Gyunei! -Right!
Get in!
I'll soon find out if he's telling the truth.
Switch over control to the combat bridge!
Thank you.
You won't have to go out today.
Let's hope not.
Quess and the Alpha seem to be made for each other.
Is that so?
Alpha-Azieru, prepare for launch!
All hands, level 1 battle stations!
Alpha-Azieru.
Come on!
Don't get carried away, Quess!
There's a ton of things to do!
More playful than hostile.
It's not Char, or that other guy.
What? Someone's blocking my senses.
Quess! That's Nu Gundam! It's tough!
Oh, yeah?
I don't have time to play with children.
What is it doing?
Out of my way!
What are those?
Take this!
Quess! The Gundam is over here!
You're out of luck, Gundam!
Get him!
-Stop playing around with the small fry! -Small fry?
How about this?
You're not getting to the Captain!
It turned hostile!
Oh, no!
Six enemy units!
Quess, is that you? Stop it!
Gyunei!
I know! Why are his funnels lasting so long?
Stop being such a pain to the Captain!
-Nu Gundam is alone, out in front! -Where is the mobile suit backup?
They're doing the best they can!
You won't get anywhere being angry at each other!
Quess! What you're doing is wrong!
Chan! What are you doing?
There aren't enough mobile suits out there!
No, not that one!
-Stop it, Chan! -I've repaired one of the main engines.
That's not what I--
You out of your mind? Chan!
Amuro needs more psycho-frames.
Chan! Stop!
Cruiser 4 has entered Axis.
Good. Program the warheads to detonate just before it hits Earth.
And retrieve the crew.
Captain, I won't stop you now, but once you beat Amuro…
Right. I'll do whatever you ask, then.
Now move to the combat bridge. Sure.
Good girl.
Quess is in that cluster of lights.
This thing moves!
The funnels won't last!
No, Quess! Stop it!
What?
Did you get Gyunei?
They're about to give Axis its final boost.
Nuclear missiles! -They're here! -Evade!
-They're here! -Evade!
Look, Ra-Chutter is acting as a shield!
Target nuclear thrusters!
In a minute, sir!
Retrieving Cruiser 4 crew!
And the self-detonators for the warheads?
All set, sir!
Head to the front!
Use the Musaka to crush the Londo Bell fleet!
Axis has begun to accelerate!
Fire missiles toward its rear!
Get us a lock on the target!
Estimating course! Locked on!
Good! Fire!
Which are the nukes? Funnels!
They can't possibly have that many.
There!
They've hit the nuclear missiles?
Hathaway! Amuro!
Another one?
That was clever, Bright. What?
Ra-Chutter!
-Our missiles have been taken out! -It took a hit for us…
We'll land Ra-Cailum on Axis! Prepare for ground combat!
All hands, prepare for ground combat!
-All hands, prepare for ground combat! -Hathaway?
Over here? There! Hathaway!
What's that? Is it Quess?
The psycommu's guiding me, so you won't get away!
Quess! That's you, right?
He's being a bit too friendly!
No! You'll be destroyed!
Oh, no! She's…
What the…
Move, Hathaway!
That thing…
Stop it, Quess!
That's why you're always making enemies, Quess!
You're going to lecture me too?
I have to destroy Earth and stop it from producing more egoistic men like you!
What?
Quess! I can tell you're there!
Open the hatch!
Once you see my face, you'll forget your anger.
I hate children! They're so annoying!
Hathaway! Get out of there! That girl's dangerous!
You disgusting woman.
I could've stayed with Amuro if only you weren't around!
Stayed with Amuro? Does she…
Quess! Get out!
Hathaway!
It's going to hit us! Get back, Hathaway!
Quess!
Quess!
Hathaway, are you okay?
Chan? You did that?
Stop it. Can't you see that you're--
You shouldn't have done that! You grownups don't understand!
If you did, no one would be trying to destroy Earth!
Hathaway!
Hey, shouldn't we send a backup to Londo Bell?
The battle's already started, right?
Launch with sleds! Never mind how you'll get back. Just help Londo Bell.
Never mind how you'll get back. Just help Londo Bell.
Follow me. Our destination is Axis!
Head to Axis at maximum speed. On the double!
Are they going to pick us up later?
Just go!
If we could fly, we'd be in space.
Should we try?
The sun…
Look, you can see the sun for a change.
Christina?
Hey, did you guys hear something?
No.
Captain! Londo Bell's coming! Move out!
We descend, then advance!
Mobile suits closing in!
What are the other ships doing? Call for back up!
All channels are cut!
Geara-Doga team! Return!
He's here!
He dodged it! Char!
I won't let you get to the Axis thrusters!
He dodged that too!
You're a worthy opponent!
A cruiser?
Why is it here? Of course! Char!
Amuro! Not so fast! Funnels!
Char!
I can't contaminate the Earth if they blow up here!
Amuro! Don't you realize the humans remaining on Earth
Amuro! Don't you realize the humans remaining on Earth are just vermin infesting the planet?
are just vermin infesting the planet?
-It's been hit! -Cruiser 4's warheads have detonated!
What's going on? Ra-Cailum! Give me details!
There's a huge flash of light in front!
We don't know what's causing it.
Wire's broken!
Speed up the blasting operations!
Where's the Gundam now?
Ra-Cailum has landed?
A thruster's gone?
Amuro! You won't get any more!
Above our bow! Counter!
Chan?
Is he coming?
Amuro…
Remember the pain you suffered when you killed Lalah!
-You're pathetic! -Me?
Why won't you realize that you're wasting your precious talents?
Same to you!
What, I've lost power?
-You're taking too long! -We're almost done.
This'll blow Axis to pieces.
Ra-Cailum's here! What?
They're going to blow up Axis from inside even if it means sacrificing the Gundam?
I won't let that happen!
I guess Bright's team hasn't come up yet.
He got away!
You don't understand what it means to change the world.
Revolutions are started by intellectuals,
but their unrealistic goals inevitably steer them towards extreme measures.
The radio signals are coming from below?
After a revolution succeeds,
the desire for change is slowly corrupted by bureaucracy and populism.
The intellectuals hate this,
so they eventually withdraw from society and politics.
-Do you see my point? -I'm not planning to change the world!
You're letting ignorant fools take advantage of your powers!
You think so?
He escaped? And Bright's team, too?
That was nothing!
My saber's weaker than his?
What the…
Char!
If it hadn't been for you…
Amuro!
My monitor's failing! What?
Sink the Rewloola!
We're barely hanging on ourselves!
We've got to withdraw! Do you want to go down with Axis?
-It's time! -What?
They pulled it off?
What's that? I'm to retreat?
Nanai!
Don't interfere in a battle between men!
Captain! We still need you. You can't abandon us now.
Axis is splitting apart!
Surveillance team, heads up!
You're not going anywhere!
He caught me. But it's too late!
Pursue the Rewloola!
Incoming fragments!
Mobile suit team!
-Is it true, Meran? -Yes, sir!
The front piece will go past Earth.
But the explosion slowed down the rear piece!
It should stay in orbit, though!
But the explosion had too much force!
Did we help Char destroy Earth?
Dad!
What are you laughing about?
Looks like I win.
According to my calculations,
the back end of Axis is being pulled in by Earth's gravity.
Your plan has backfired!
So you think!
I'll use the Gundam to push back that worthless piece of rock!
-Don't be stupid! -I'll just have to try!
You're insane!
-I'm not as impatient as you! -And I still have faith in humanity!
Axis is starting to free fall to Earth!
You're underestimating Nu Gundam!
Use the Ra-Cailum to push back Axis!
That's crazy!
Are we going to sit and watch the Earth be contaminated?
But the Rewloola hasn't been destroyed yet!
Captain. Tell me you won't…
Axis is accelerating!
-Check our mobile suit unit! -Yes, sir!
Amuro, are you still at Axis?
I'm not afraid to die!
Why do you think I gave you the psycho-frame data?
What?
It would be a hollow victory if you lost to me in a second-rate mobile suit.
But this has become absurd!
You're so arrogant.
Why do you always have to look down on other people?
-What? -Heat source!
Axis is burning up!
Captain…
What's wrong, Nanai?
The Captain's life is draining away.
Enemy reinforcements confirmed!
Federation mobile suits approaching from the far side of the Earth!
You sure it's not just a CG decoy?
-It's a live image! -How many are there?
From the far side of Earth?
They're not allies!
From the portside, too!
From the Earth Federation Forces?
I'm positive, sir!
-From the 88th fleet! -But why?
And they're all headed toward Axis.
"Ra-Cailum is to retrieve damaged units." End message.
Why now? Why are they joining in?
Could that light from Axis
be caused by the psycho-frame that Chan mentioned?
What are they trying to do?
What? What are you doing?
Stop it! You don't have to do this!
Stay back! Don't come!
What is it? What's going on here?
I was sure my plan was flawless!
We won't let Londo Bell take all the credit!
But your suits won't hold!
Geara-Dogas, too?
It's no use! Get back!
Earth's fate rests in the balance!
It's worth a try!
But some of the suits are exploding!
No!
You'll just destroy yourselves from the heat and power overload!
Don't do this! Get out of here!
I knew it. This is the sort of tragedy that will keep happening until Earth is destroyed.
This is the sort of tragedy that will keep happening until Earth is destroyed.
Mankind must pass judgment on themselves.
They have to atone for what they've done to mother nature and Earth!
Why can't you see this, Amuro?
Get out of here!
The Gundam's power will…
The psycho-frames must be resonating.
It's going into overload from the thoughts and feelings concentrated here!
But I sense no fear.
It's warm…
And reassuring.
I'm powerless…
Behind that curtain of light!
Mobile suits are being tossed around!
We need better surveillance! What's happening down there?
I see. But the humans who possess this warmth are still cruel enough to destroy Earth.
You must understand that, Amuro!
I do know that.
That's why we have to show the world the light of the human heart!
For a man who thinks that way, you were awfully cold to Quess.
I'm not a machine!
I can't be a father figure to Quess!
Is that it?
Is that why you used Quess like some kind of machine?
So Quess was searching for a father figure.
That explains why I found her annoying and turned her into a machine.
I thought you were better than that!
Lalah Sune could have been a mother to me.
You don't get to judge me, not after taking her life!
Lalah? Your mother?
Captain!
Nanai? What's the matter?
Axis is now moving away from Earth!
That can't be!
Damn.
Thanks for the present, Bennie.
I guess we're in the same business.
Okay. I'm on my way.
Don't want to keep the roaches waiting.
-Hey, Mike. Watch your step. -Yeah, yeah.
-These tracks are still live? -Williams, over here.
Jesus Christ. What happened to him?
Jesus Christ. What happened to him? I don't think he got electrocuted.
What's going on with his eyes?
Don't know yet. We'll have to wait for the autopsy.
What did this guy see to leave an expression like that?
Any witnesses?
Not to the accident. A guy went to grab a paper out of the newsstand.
When he came back, the victim was like this.
According to this guy, his eyes were bleeding prior to the swan dive.
-Must have been into computers. -His name's Polidori.
He and another guy wrote the book.
Must have tried to stop the train with it. Had to pry it out of his fingers.
Now all we need is the leading lady.
-You want one? -No, thanks.
Give it up, Mike. The Feds are covering that now. It's over.
The Feds haven't done shit.
Not hearing from him doesn't mean he's stopped.
You're pissed off because this Doctor guy keeps sending you love letters.
Everyone has cases they can't crack. Don't let it fuck with your head.
What now?
Get him out of here. Put him in a holding pen, an empty one.
And get someone to translate whatever language he's speaking.
Jesus Christ.
Check him for a passport, an ID, something in fucking English.
It says he's a German exchange student, Dieter Schrader.
Lives over in the Village. Here's the address.
Call the health bunnies, DOH.
Find out if there's some bug going around, something with bloody eyes.
They can send someone to meet me at his apartment.
Sykes! Leave the doughnut shop here. Let's go! Come on.
Johnny!
Know any German?
-I can sing "She Loves You" in German. -Great. That'll help.
Police!
Anyone here?
Artists.
-I wouldn't touch her just yet. -Jesus.
Actually, Terry Huston, Department of Health.
-Detective Reilly. You got here fast. -Yeah.
Goddamn it.
God! -What do you make of this? -This is really fascinating.
-What do you make of this? -This is really fascinating.
She's displaying possible signs of a hemorrhagic virus. Something like Ebola.
Excuse me.
-Reilly. -Reilly, we got a problem.
Sykes! Hello? Sykes? What are you doing? Call the coroner.
Yeah, right.
Jesus.
What is it? You better get back to the station.
You better get back to the station. I got a dead girl, a woman from DOH saying we have a serious problem.
I got a dead girl, a woman from DOH saying we have a serious problem.
-I'm not going anywhere. -I think you better get back here.
And bring the DOH with you.
Do you have a plastic bag?
-That's evidence. -Yeah.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
-That's German. It means "murderer." -I got that. What's with the 48?
Don't know.
Barlow, what happened here? The guys said he was talking to himself. That's it.
The guys said he was talking to himself. That's it.
The guys said he was talking to himself. That's it. We'll know more when we get him to the morgue.
We'll know more when we get him to the morgue. All right, stand back.
Great.
Should we be in one of those suits they're wearing?
-We're probably already infected. -So we could all just be dying here?
What is it with you people? You just let this shit run wild?
Thanks.
Serum panel is all clear. It's not a virus.
So we're back at square one.
We've got the camcorder.
Sorry about the space patrol, but we had to be sure.
No problem. I love needles stuck in me. It's a hobby of mine.
So you like working with bugs and viruses?
Someone's got to do it. Otherwise, disease spreads out of control.
You do the same thing.
At least I can see what I'm dealing with. This other shit creeps me out.
I hate germs and....
Diseases. What about bugs?
I pretty much hate them too.
-You know you sleep with bugs? -What?
You sleep with bugs.
No, I don't, actually.
Yeah, you do. Everyone does.
Dust mites. They're in your carpets, in your bed.
They look like little lobsters. In fact, they're distant relatives.
-You're enjoying this, aren't you? -I just don't get out much.
I can see that.
I'm sorry.
I'm being inconsiderate, making you uncomfortable.
I'm so used to seeing through a lens, I forget how intimidating a camera can be.
I'm doing a little film at the Wilton Theater, and....
You know, I can't say this without it sounding like a line, but....
I was filming you because you happen to be the perfect leading lady.
Do you mean that?
I can't promise anything...
...but come by the theater tonight...
...I'll put you in front of the camera, see what happens.
You have to punch this button. Then you can record us.
Hard to believe that's the same guy.
Wait!
-I can watch this later. -Wait a second.
The guy's losing it.
Oh, my God.
Jesus.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
The sun's out. Another storm coming.
Shit! I got a ticket.
I think I can take care of this for you.
Really?
So I'll see you later?
Thanks.
Terry, could you come in here?
Mr. Turnbull?
Did you want something?
No.
Yeah.
What happened with the German kids? Is it Ebola?
No. I don't even think it's a virus.
-What, then? -I don't know.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm just tired.
Let me know if you hear anything, okay?
Sure.
-Where did your computer go? -Broke.
I sent it in for repair.
-Playing on the Internet too much? -Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna go finish my report.
Hot!
Cause of death appears to be a stroke brought on by a surge of adrenaline.
No signs of violence except the bleeding.
Hi, you must be Terry Huston. I'm Thana Brinkman.
One moment.
Severe rupturing to the ocular blood vessels. I can't account for it.
Heart is completely engorged.
There's a massive hemorrhage to the cerebral cortex.
Death was instantaneous. End report.
-So it was a stroke. -Unless lab tests find something else.
There's no known virus, bacteria or virulent protein.
Excuse me.
Brinkman.
We have another one.
Oh, my God. It's Eddie Turnbull.
Did your husband have any medical problems?
Any condition that would contribute to his sudden death?
Other than the chain-smoking and the chronic stress?
I tried to warn him. It never bothered him until these last couple of days.
He got kind of sick, started seeing things.
-What kind of things? -Crazy things.
Said someone was watching him.
Kept talking about a little girl. There was no little girl.
I think he worked himself to death.
Always working. Always on his computer.
You know what's odd, though?
It was like he was afraid of it.
Mrs. Turnbull, do you mind if we take this?
Now, you and I share a great responsibility...
...to them.
They've come to watch but also to learn.
We will provide a lesson...
...that reducing relationships...
...to anonymous, electronic impulses...
...is a perversion.
But here, we offer intimacy.
So tell us about yourself, who you are, where you're from.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
Did you dream of being a ballerina when you grew up?
You're gonna kill me, aren't you?
Of course I'm gonna kill you.
The Internet offers birth, sex, commerce...
...seduction, proselytising, politics...
...posturing.
Death is a logical component.
An intimate experience made more so...
...by knowing the victim.
So, Karen...
...tell us your hopes and dreams.
Nothing. Nothing in common.
Polidori had a bad childhood, some juvenile stuff.
Cleaned up at tech school.
German kids seem clean. One was arrested for weed, big surprise.
Turnbull didn't even have a traffic ticket. I don't know.
Let's start over. We gotta be missing something.
They all had the same pattern of bleeding, right?
They all had burnt computers.
Maybe this guy was trying to tell us something.
We gotta get these computers checked out.
I know a forensic programmer, Denise Stone. She's worked with me before.
She might be able to help.
We need to find a common link on these computers.
-They look pretty fried, and this one.... -You think you can do it?
-They look pretty fried, and this one.... -You think you can do it? The data should still be retrievable.
Unless the files have been corrupted.
I'll see what I can do.
-You're the best. -I know.
Turn around, Bennie.
I don't want you watching this.
Forty-eight hours. 48.
Do you like to watch?
Okay, I think we get the idea.
I'm waiting for you. Denise.
Come and find out.
Don't you want to play with me?
Do you want to hurt me?
You're lying.
How enticing the smell of cheap perfume can be.
Or is that fear?
I'd like to say I can feel your pain...
...but I can't.
I can't feel anything.
I've been deprived of that somehow.
I know what I should feel.
I just can't feel it.
You can end this lesson whenever you wish. Simply ask me to kill you.
She wants to live.
Very well.
Let the lesson commence.
-Denise! -It's you.
-Hi. -What's wrong?
I'm fine. I just came to give you this.
-Where did you get this? -I was there.
What do you mean?
Denise, tell me.
The one thing all the victims have in common... -...is the Fear site. -That doesn't make any sense.
-...is the Fear site. -That doesn't make any sense.
-He wouldn't use the same site twice. -Who?
The Doctor.
-Who's the Doctor? -A skeleton in my closet.
It's a live-cam death site.
That's not like Turnbull. Why would he watch that?
People love to see death.
Why do you think the ratings are so high on reality disaster shows?
Maybe it's a way to find out about death before it's your turn.
I gotta go.
Wait. Do you think you can trace who's running the site?
-Sure. -Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. Fine.
Denise....
Be careful. We'll see you soon.
-Hey, come on. -Where we going?
I did some reading last night.
-We're looking for Frank Bryant. -Over there in the back, hon.
-Last table. -Okay, thanks.
Frank Bryant?
Are you Mr. Frank...
...Bryant?
-How can I help you, officers? -How did you know we were cops?
Nobody ever says my name that way except cops.
We're not here to cause you any trouble.
We read your book, the parts we could understand.
Really? I didn't realize my book was still being sold.
-We found it on a dead man. -A guy named Polidori.
-We found it on a dead man. -A guy named Polidori. Polidori?
Polidori is dead?
What can you tell us about him?
A good guy.
A decent friend.
Why would he be clutching your book as if it were the Holy Grail?
I couldn't make much sense of it myself.
That's because it was a load of shit.
I needed a new car, so I wrote the book.
I was driving along one day, looking at the telephone poles and the wires...
...and I came up with this idea.
What would happen if you connected a whole bunch of computers together?
You'd get one big computer. Like a supercomputer.
A neuronet.
Polidori and I used to spend long nights talking about it.
He came to believe that the Web could receive energy...
-...store it, send it out. -Energy. What kind?
-Here you go. -Thanks, doll.
Fuck if I know. I mean, you know....
Negative energy, magnetic fields... ...psychic energy stealing your soul. You know?
...psychic energy stealing your soul. You know?
-And? -Polidori believed he knew...
...where that site existed.
But then again, Polidori was fucked up.
And now...
...he's dead.
Do you remember the name of the site?
-No idea. -Do you think he was right?
I never believed a word of it.
But then, I'm drunk by 8 p.m.
It's noon. Hey, I'm ahead of the game.
Hey, I'm ahead of the game.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Bryant.
-If we need to reach you.... -I'll be here.
-I have no reason to leave. -Okay.
Oh, my God.
She was the first. Jeannie Richardson. He killed her on the Fear site.
He tortures his victims till they beg to die.
-This is the Doctor, right? -Yeah.
His name's Alistair Pratt. He was thrown out of medical school.
Nine months, he fucked with me. I never even got close.
How come?
After every killing, he'd change the site. We couldn't trace it.
What time did Polidori die?
-Three a.m. -Turnbull was later, about 6, right?
6:15.
Based on that, these victims died two days to the minute...
...after they logged on to the site. The German kid was trying to tell us.
Shit. Denise.
Come on, Denise.
-You trying to get ahold of Denise? -Why?
She was supposed to drop something off. She didn't show--
Get units over there now!
-What you talking about? -I said get units over there now!
-She's not there. She's not answering. -Keep trying.
-Just dial it again. -I am. I just tried. She's not there.
I should never have gotten her involved.
I should have fucking warned her.
-It's not your fault. -I still don't get one thing.
Everybody died 48 hours after they went on to that site, right? Everybody.
Denise doesn't fit the pattern.
Maybe it was easier to die than face whatever is on the website.
What do you mean?
Eddie Turnbull was terrified of car crashes.
It was a childhood thing. He was manic about it.
I did some research. Did you know the German girl was terrified of drowning?
-But she didn't drown. -She died in water.
Maybe she died of her greatest fear.
I don't know, Terry. I don't know, I think you're reaching.
-Maybe. -Denise got too close.
Someone killed her. It's as simple as that.
Can you promise me one thing?
That you won't visit that site?
God, Denise.
Do you like to watch?
Do you want to see more?
Do you want to hurt me, Mike?
Jeannie!
I know who you are, and I know what you really want.
Time to play. Time for us to become one.
How do I play?
Find me.
You have 48 hours.
Me.
What happens if I lose?
You die.
Do you want to play?
What are you afraid of?
God!
Jesus.
Sorry, did I scare you?
Miss, your glove.
Mike?
The website. I saw her.
-Who did you see? -The dead girl.
-What dead girl? -Jeannie Richardson.
I saw her.
Bryant was only half right.
-What do you mean? -It's not just energy.
-I don't understand. -She's out there, alive in the wires.
If the will is strong, it can live in the objects around it.
You don't go there, all right? Promise me.
Tell me you won't go there!
Don't go there! Promise me you won't go there!
Forty-eight hours.
Hello, Terry. Are you ready to play?
Why are you killing Mike?
Guilty.
Guilty of what?
Watching.
Are you ready to play?
Yes.
Shit!
-Hey, Sykes. -Hey.
I need to take a look at the Doctor files.
Let's go in here.
Look.
The Feds are covering this now.
I suppose you think you can do better?
Mike doesn't like people fucking with his-- Stop! All right!
Jesus-fucking-Christ.
Knock yourself out.
Jeannie Richardson.
Yeah, she was beautiful.
Yeah, Jeannie. I checked out her addresses. Shit holes.
Artist/model, my ass.
You, though...
...you're a different story.
Will you shut the fuck up?
Oh, my God.
Joseph Stalin said that the death of one person is a tragedy...
...the death of a million: a statistic.
Your death will give meaning to all us sad, little lives out there.
See? The audience is never wrong.
They smell death.
Mrs. Richardson?
Do you have a moment to talk about your daughter?
This is Jean Marie on the day of her First Communion.
This is the Jeannie I know, not what they said. They didn't know her.
So beautiful.
She was a happy child despite her condition.
-Are you okay? -Yes, I'm fine.
Condition? Did you say, condition?
Jean Marie was a haemophiliac.
Without medication, she could bleed to death from just a scratch.
Left her scared to death of anything sharp.
-Scissors or knives. -Yes. That ball....
She always had that thing with her. Willful child, wouldn't give it up.
It wasn't until she discovered boys that she finally left it behind.
Could you take a look at these pictures for me and tell me...
...if there's any places that you recognize in them?
It's the old Poelzig steel mill two miles down the road.
Jeannie used to play there as a child.
What are you watching?
You seem like you were expecting me.
Where is she?
No.
Mike Reilly, where is he?
Excuse me? Can I help you?
Just tell me where he is!
Please calm down, or I'll have to ask you to leave.
Yeah, okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I just-- I really need to see him right now.
Okay. First door on your left.
Hello?
Hello, Terry.
Are you ready to play?
-Goddamn you, what do you want? -Play the game. Find me.
Where are you?
Time is running out.
Leave me alone! Where are you?
Oh, my God.
Do you like to watch?
I am waiting for you.
Jeannie?
Come and find out.
Don't you want to play?
Do you want to hurt me?
You're lying.
Oh, my God.
I found you. I found your body. I did what you wanted.
I know who you are.
And I know what you really want.
Time to play.
Time for us to become one.
Find me.
Oh, my God.
What time is it?
You shouldn't leave your front door open.
-Oh, my God. -It invites illegal entry.
Mike.
Terry.
What did you do?
Why?
-You just ran out, didn't you? -More like a slow trot.
You gotta go back.
No, they can't help me now.
-I'm drifting in and out more and more. -Okay.
-I'm running out of time. -We gotta go.
-Where are we going? -The morgue.
Are you two okay? You don't look good.
You should see it from our side.
I just thought once we found the body, that would be an end to it.
No, there's got to be more to this.
She had a reason.
Someone performed an autopsy on this body a long time ago.
Someone performed an autopsy on this body a long time ago. -Look at the incisions. -It's Alistair.
-Look at the incisions. -It's Alistair.
He cut her open while she was still alive.
Textbook procedure. He cut out her viscera. Then he bagged them and sewed her up.
He cut out her viscera. Then he bagged them and sewed her up.
What's that?
She must have swallowed it before he killed her.
"The guilty must be punished."
So she didn't want a burial.
She wants revenge.
Bingo.
Two days.
Two days is how long Alistair tortured Jeannie before she died.
Knives, Mike.
She died her worst nightmare.
Shit, Terry, I'm losing it.
-I'm having trouble staying here. -Hold on, okay?
Wait here.
Come on.
Electroshock, as it is sometimes called....
Electrodes are attached to the patient's head....
Oh, my God!
Mike.
I found him.
Are you in, or what?
-Two. -One.
-It better be important. -Sykes, I need your help.
What? I'm winning here.
-Look, I found the Doctor. -So? Call the Feds.
There's no time for that. I need backup.
All right.
-Where is it? -A cooling tower. Poelzig steel mill.
I love watching these old tapes.
Jeannie Richardson.
She was my favorite.
You see, I believe death should be repulsive...
...so we don't grow too fond of it.
But...
...all this could be avoided...
...if you're ready.
No tears. Take joy in the fact that you've done great good here.
You asked for death...
...so I'm no longer your murderer.
The time has come, Karen.
Drop it now!
-Drop the fucking knife now! -Bless my soul.
Reilly, so glad you could make it to the party.
-You brought a date. -Get away from her.
I'm not gonna fire a warning shot!
Guns are so impersonal and artless.
If you want to hurt someone intimately, you have to get up-close and personal.
You already tortured her. Shooting her would be doing her a favor.
You won't shoot. You suffer from the curse of hope.
Yeah, I got hope. I hope my first shot blows your fucking head off!
If you kill her, you'll have no one to hide behind.
I don't want to spoil things, but if you're...
...expecting the cavalry to save the day, you're gonna be disappointed.
The cavalry's right there.
Oh, my God!
Fuck!
Not a very nice person, Mr. Sykes. Appalling eating habits.
Too bad this show always has the same ending.
No, not this time.
Someone wants revenge.
No!
I guess the fans love a comeback.
Mike.
Look at me. Stay with me. Hold on. Hold on.
Stay with me. Mike. Mike, look at me.
Hold on. Hold on! Look at me! No!
Attractive women like you sell through the roof.
Just like Jeannie.
Alistair.
Alistair!
You're dead! I killed you!
Alistair.
Alistair...
...time to feel.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Time to die.
Oh, my God.
No, Mike.
Quite deadly in the right hands.
Agent One.
I have been so looking forward to this moment.
Well, in that case... I'll try not to disappoint.
You overestimate your power over women, Mr. English.
I'd say that would be virtually impossible.
Sir? Sir?
Sir!
- Have you got them? - Hmm? The mission documents. Agent One's flying to Biarritz tonight.
Yes, yes, the mission documents. They're here somewhere. Don't worry.
Ah! Here we are.
Agent One.
Gentlemen.
I'm here for my documents.
Bough, Agent One's documents, please.
- Thank you.
Your mission documents, Agent One.
Including the codes for the submarine hatch,
which I've checked myself.
- Thank you. - So, is it just France tonight,
or will you be slipping over the Pyrenees as well?
If I told you that, I'm afraid I'd have to kill you.
Oh, yes, yes. Well, I expect you would.
Cheerio, Agent One.
Bonne chance!
Arrivederci.
Such class.
Such distinction.
English: The greatest secret agent England's ever had,
snuffed out in an instant.
Terrible.
Do you know what makes us envied the world over, Bough?
That there's always another agent waiting to step into the breach.
Absolutely, sir.
And every last one of them is gathered round that grave.
It is our honor and privilege to guard them while they grieve.
Their lives are in our hands, Bough.
Everything in order, English?
I think you'll find it's rather more than just in order, sir.
You're now entering the most secure location
in the whole of England.
Man: Pegasus, we face a national crisis.
Agent One was clearly onto something, and we have to find out what.
I need another agent on this immediately. - Who else is there? - No one, Prime Minister.
- Who else is there? - No one, Prime Minister.
They all died in the explosion.
All of them?
Well, luckily, there is one who survived. Who?
- ♪ Sendin' villains to Hades, a hit with the ladies ♪  - Johnny. Hello.
Right.
Johnny English. I'm here to see Pegasus.
Still, no sense rushing things.
( tires screech ) There are some items you need to sign before your briefing.
This is your new retinal ID card,
and this is your level-nine security clearance.
and this is your level-nine security clearance. Sign and date, please.
Oh, reminds me of the old service-issue ballpoint.
I remember every agent would carry a pen that looked just like this.
Completely innocent to the untrained eye, but click it twice...
Ah, English, there you are.
Have you seen my secretary?
Um... She went out.
shall we?
Now, Agent One believed that there was a plot to steal the Crown Jewels.
Now, they've recently been through a multimillion-pound restoration,
a multimillion-pound restoration, largely paid for by a corporate sponsor, of course.
And they're due to be unveiled tonight at the Tower of London.
Unfortunately, the Queen is insisting that the ceremony goes ahead, so what we want you to--
that the ceremony goes ahead, so what we want you to--
Ha! Who-- who--
who is the sponsor, sir?
Pascal Sauvage.
What, that flouncy Frenchman who owns a couple of prisons?
Sauvage's £7-billion empire, English, operates over 400 prisons in 60 countries.
- He's built 25 of them here. - Right, sir.
- He's built 25 of them here. - Right, sir. The man's related to the royal family, for goodness' sake.
As far as the prime minister's concerned, he's one of the greatest friends England's got.
Now, English, I want you at the Tower tonight,
monitoring this unveiling.
Any chink in security, any weakness,
however slight, must be plugged immediately.
Do we understand each other?
- Perfectly, sir. - Good.
- Oh, yes. - And, uh, English?
We can't afford any mistakes. Not tonight.
The word "mistake," sir, is not one that appears in my dictionary.
Fantastic car, sir!
Mr. English, Colonel Sir Anthony Chevenix,
Mr. English, Colonel Sir Anthony Chevenix, head of royal security.
Ah, Colonel, good evening.
Ah, Colonel, good evening. Snipers posted on the roof as per my request?
- 13 of them. - Windows?
- 13 of them. - Windows? Refitted with bullet- and shatter-proof glass, as ordered.
I shall now mingle inconspicuously with the guests.
Let me know when Her Majesty arrives. Very good.
Shall I mingle with you, sir?
Oh, yes, Bough. Once you've checked the roof.
Help! Help!
Well, hello.
Hello, yourself.
Johnny English.
Lorna Campbell.
A bloody Mary, please, not too spicy.
So, are you here in some professional capacity?
I worked on the restoration of the Jewels.
- Intriguing. - And yourself?
If I told you that, I'm afraid I'd have to kill you.
I'd like to see you try.
Monsieur Sauvage, on behalf of Her Majesty,
may I welcome you to the Tower.
Merci, monsieur. So, are you here alone, Mr. English?
That's how I choose to live my life, Miss Campbell.
Women want safety, security.
I can offer them nothing but danger.
Some women find danger very attractive.
Women like you, Miss Campbell?
Women like you, Miss Campbell? Women like me expect men like you to find that out for yourself.
Mmm... Madame.
Oh, it's for me, actually, and could you rustle up
Oh, it's for me, actually, and could you rustle up some of those cheesy niblets that are going around?
Now, where were we?
You obviously haven't met our host, Monsieur Sauvage.
No, thank God.
You know, I think I'd rather have my bottom impaled on a giant cactus
than exchange pleasantries with that jumped-up Frenchman.
As far as I'm concerned,
the only thing the French should be allowed to host is an invasion.
Sorry, can I help?
Pascal Sauvage, jumped-up Frenchman.
Lorna Campbell. I've been so looking forward to meeting you.
Pascal: Enchanté.
( stammering )
But of course. You're Johnny English. I've heard all about you, and between you and me,
I've heard all about you, and between you and me, I'm not so keen on the French myself.
I'm not so keen on the French myself. But, please, don't tell them that.
But, please, don't tell them that. Let me go and search for your nibbly cheese bits.
Oh, no, no, I don't-- Please, I insist.
Please, I insist. The French are, after all, fantastic waiters.
- The best in the world.  - Well, but-- but--
Wait here, and I will wait on you. No, no, really. There's no--
No, no, please. Please, please, please!
Les Français.
Ils sont... very...
N'est-ce pas?
Ladies and gentlemen, mesdames et messieurs,
bienvenue. Welcome tonight to this wonderful occasion.
As we stand here in the Tower of London, the most famous prison in the world,
where these wonderful Jewels will rest safely under lock and key,
I want to thank you for giving me this wonderful experience to contribute
this wonderful experience to contribute to the restoration of these Jewels.
It was, as we say in France,  le top, the best of.
And what a beautiful--
It's Colonel Chevenix!
He's got a nasty wound, sir. Who hit him?
The assailant. He ran in here!
Bough, you guard the door.
Oh, for God's sake, Bough, don't come in! The man's a maniac!
( crowd gasps ) You don't frighten me!
Missed!
( crowd gasps ) I have managed to subdue the assailant.
The panic's over. Everything's under control.
Thank you, and now, ladies and gentlemen,
we should compose ourselves for the arrival of Her Majesty
and return to the sight of our great nation's
and return to the sight of our great nation's magnificently restored Crown Jewels.
( crowd gasps ) I know. I feel it, too.
The very symbols of our island nation, so close we could almost reach out and--
( fanfare plays ) Man: Pray silence for Her Majesty the Queen!
Woman: Oh. where are the Jewels?
Man: It's an unmitigated disaster, English. I couldn't agree more, sir.
Well, we need to get these Jewels back, English, and fast.
Tell me about this assailant, because when they searched the room later,
there was no sign of him.
Well, the man was clearly a professional.
He must have escaped while the Queen was being sedated.
But he's the only lead we've got, English. We have to find him! Come in.
This is-- this is Roger from Data Support.
Please sit down. He'll produce a likeness based on your description.
So tell us, what did this man look like?
Um... Well...
he was... big.
Hair color?
Um... Orange.
Orange?
Mmm. And curly.
Well, frizzy, actually. Frizzy sort of thing.
Well, frizzy, actually. Frizzy sort of thing. Frizzy.
An eye patch.
Broken nose.
Very few teeth.
Two, I would say, at the most.
And a scar on his cheek,
in the shape...
of a banana.
Which cheek?
Both... cheeks.
They sort of met in the middle.
Are you sure about this, English?
Ah, yes, that's him. An uncanny resemblance.
Why, it's just as if he's in the room with us.
Wow! Look at this, sir. Got all the bells and whistles, doesn't it?
Never mind about the gadgets, Bough. Just focus on the case.
Oh, uh...
Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for waiting.
Now, the question that faces us this morning is a simple one.
Namely, how did the thieves gain access to this highly secure environment
and then escape with the Jewels afterwards?
A simple question,
but one which I believe has a complex answer.
- Actually, sir-- - Please, Bough. My mind is at work.
Now, what you must grasp, gentlemen, is that the master criminal sees not a room,
is that the master criminal sees not a room, but a series of opportunities.
Should I go in through the window?
Possibly.
Should I drop down from the ceiling?
Perhaps. Actually, sir--
There's one thing I think we can be fairly confident about,
and that is that they didn't come up through the fl--
I've got you, sir.
Right. That's all right. Just come my way, Bough.
Right. That's all right. Just come my way, Bough. That'd bring me right over the hole, sir. Bough, there's no need to panic.
Can you see the bottom yet, Bough?
Not yet, sir! The shaft appears to be narrowing!
I'm just a little bit worried I might get stuck.
Trust me, Bough, you won't get stuck if you just keep moving.
Yes, sir.
Right. Okay, sir.
Are you at the bottom now, Bough?
No, I am in fact stuck now, sir.
Oh, for God's sake, Bough.
Oh, for God's sake, Bough. Stay there! I'm coming down.
Uh, I'm not especially sure that's a good idea, sir.
Don't worry.
Be careful, sir!
Gently does it.
( screaming ) Sir?
You all right, sir?
You all right, sir? Yes. I landed on something quite soft.
Yes. I landed on something quite soft. - That was me, sir.  - Ah, good.
What now? There's no way back up there, that's for sure.
But this must lead somewhere.
But this must lead somewhere. I'm ever so slightly uncomfortable in the dark, sir.
There's nothing to worry about, Bough. It may be pitch-black, but we can still see.
Can we, sir? How?
The Bedouin monks of the al-Maghrib mountains
developed a system of sonic chanting.
- I see, sir. - The sound of their chanting
would bounce back off any obstacles,
and using their highly tuned ears,
they could paint a mental picture of the path ahead.
Brilliant, sir. However, you must always sing in E-flat.
( nasal humming ) ♪ E-flat, E-flat ♪ ♪ Gotta find E-fla-a-t ♪
♪ The songs I'm singing ♪ Is it working, sir? Extremely well, thank you, Bough.
- ( thump ) - Ow! - You all right, sir? - Ow!
I think I can see something, sir.
Oh, yeah. Shh! Come on.
Man: Here's the long one.
Man: It is a long one. Careful.
- I knew it. - Shall we call for backup, sir?
What? And watch some fat-bottomed bobby make our arrest for us?
I don't think so.
Good morning, gentlemen. MI-7 at your service.
Observe, Bough, the dull incompetence of the criminal mind.
It can never hope to match our level of technical expertise.
- You've got it.  - Bough: What do we do now, sir?
Watch and learn, Bough.
It's no good, sir. They're too far ahead of us. Have faith, Bough. They're heading south.
- There they are, sir! - Just as I thought.
Hang on tight, Bough.
( horn blares ) We're never gonna catch them in this.
We're never gonna catch them in this. Take the wheel, Bough. I'm getting in the Aston. Sir?
Change places, Bough. I'm getting out the other side.
Change places, Bough. I'm getting out the other side. Sir?
Set, Bough. Take me up.
Swing me out, Bough!
Down.
Up! Up!
Sorry!
Bough, pull out!
Those idiots are right behind us. Faster!
Drop me here, Bough!
No! No! No!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
They're turning into the Brompton Cemetery, Bough.
Get here as soon as you can. I'm going in.
In a wheelchair.
But Geoffrey overcame these terrible disabilities
with that simple resilience and sunny optimism
that so warmed all of us who knew him,
spending the rest of his life in the service of the poor and disabled of this parish.
It's very good. Really very good.
No, no, please. No, go on. I'm sorry to interrupt.
No, no, please. No, go on. I'm sorry to interrupt. - It's very entertaining.  - Who's that?
That priest act of yours should keep the other prisoners entertained for hours.
should keep the other prisoners entertained for hours. Oh, I'm so sorry. Where are my manners?
Johnny English, British Secret Service, and you are all under arrest.
and you are all under arrest. I must say, you've done this whole thing very well. The attention to detail is excellent.
The attention to detail is excellent. You, the grieving granny, you're very convincing.
Oh, look. Real tears. Do you get paid extra for that?
Ah! What we're all here for. I know! Why don't we take a look inside?
Oh! You've nailed it down!
Why would you do that?
I know you're gonna come back in two weeks and dig it up again.
( hums Chopin's "Funeral March" ) Now, what are you playing in this little vignette of deceit and villainy?
I'm the hearse driver.
You're the hearse driver? - Yes, sir. - Mmm.
- You're the hearse driver? - Yes, sir.
Ha! Ah-ha! There you are... Gunther.
Uh, I do hope he hasn't made a nuisance of himself.
I'm Doctor, um...
Bough of the... Lunatic Response Unit.
I'm afraid Gunther here wasn't supposed to be released until 2028.
Isn't that right, Gunther?
Yes, yes, there's been a most monumental cock-up.
Um... If you'll excuse me, with the deepest respect, utmost sympathy.
Uh... He hasn't urinated on anyone, has he?
He hasn't urinated on anyone, has he? - No. - No, no.
That's a blessing.
Are you gonna give me the gun, Gunther?
There, that wasn't too difficult, was it?
Are you going to come home now?
Oh! In the van!
Yes, yes, we are going in the van. Yes, yeah. Vroom, vroom!
( babbles gibberish ) Yes. Yeah.
Yes. He's waving goodbye. Goodbye, everyone.
- All: Goodbye. - Goodbye, Gunther.
Mind the nice dead people. There we go.
Oh! We'll just go to the path here.
There. Big step. It's a graveyard. It's where they bring people when they pass--
Yes, yes, all right, Bough. You can stop now.
Yes, yes, all right, Bough. You can stop now. For appearances' sake, I'll just hold your arm, sir.
Yes, yes. Just keep walking.
In fact, run, run, run!
I can't believe I've done this.
I mean, I really cannot believe I've done this!
You see, 200 years ago,
my family should have inherited the throne of England,
but they were cast aside.
Well, in a few very short days, it will be back where it belongs.
With me.
Shall I try it on?
Yes? No? Maybe?
To make you King, we need the Archbishop of Canterbury to do that.
The Archbishop of Canterbury is being taken care of even as we speak.
is being taken care of even as we speak.
There's only one thing, sir. What are we going to do about English?
If I were you, I wouldn't worry too much about English.
He is no threat to us. I had his flat bugged.
Clearly, the aptly named English is a fool.
He might be a fool, but he's a fool who keeps showing up.
Well, the next time he shows up,
eliminate him.
Thank you.
Dieter Klein and Klaus Vendetta, sir.
Dieter Klein and Klaus Vendetta, sir. Released from prison six months ago, 327 convictions between them.
Armed robbery, grievous bodily harm, combined parking fines of more than 400--
Yes, yes, all right. Thank you, Bough. I think we get the picture.
I think we get the picture. The point is, sir, that Vendetta and Klein
The point is, sir, that Vendetta and Klein are both in the employ of Monsieur Sauvage.
- Pascal Sauvage? - Precisely, sir.
But you're not suggesting Sauvage is involved?
But you're not suggesting Sauvage is involved? I think he's more than just involved, sir.
I think he's more than just involved, sir. I'm convinced he's up to his French neck in it.
Don't be absurd. Sauvage employs thousands of people.
Just because two of them are villains doesn't mean that he is.
doesn't mean that he is. I want him discounted from this investigation immediately.
Yes, sir.
All right, tonight I shall be at Sauvage's reception for the new French ambassador.
Any developments, you can reach me there.
Apart from that, I don't want you within 100 miles of the man.
Absolutely, sir.
Requisition order-- MI-7 quartermasters for immediate supply.
One military transport plane, fully fuelled
with permission for night-time city over-flight.
Two night camouflage parachutes, plus reserves,
plus neoprene bodysuits, twice, in black. I've never liked the navy blue.
And a 40-inch chest for me 'cause I need the sleeve length.
- Morning, Felch. - Morning.
Oh, and two special forces signet rings, primed and color-coded.
What's all this for, sir? For tonight's operation, Bough.
For tonight's operation, Bough. We're going to break into Sauvage's headquarters.
We're going to break into Sauvage's headquarters. - But I thought Pegasus said-- - You let me worry about Pegasus.
I know that Sauvage is behind all this,
and tonight we're gonna get the evidence to prove it.
and tonight we're gonna get the evidence to prove it. Something wrong, sir?
Did that sound like Felch to you?
Bough.
You, upstairs.
Can you see him, Bough?
He's on the upper level, sir.
Got him.
And like a coiled viper... he strikes.
So what you're saying, sir, is there must have been two of them?
Oh, at least, Bough. Possibly four. I wonder why I didn't see them.
You mustn't dwell on your mistakes, Bough.
You must learn from them, then move on. Yes, sir.
- So where were you, sir? - Just drop it, Bough!
Ah! What is it, sir?
That bike.
You get things sorted out for tonight.
Well, well, we meet again.
Mr. English. What a pleasant surprise.
Mr. English. What a pleasant surprise. I wondered when you might show up again.
I wondered when you might show up again. On the contrary, Miss Campbell. It is not I who keeps showing up. It's you.
Do you like sushi?
Hmm? Oh, sushi!
Oh! I practically live off the stuff.
You might say the mysteries of the Orient are no mystery to me.
Sake?
Oh, ah, sake.
Now then, perhaps you can explain how it is
Now then, perhaps you can explain how it is that I run into you at two crime scenes
and then can't find any record of you on a single government computer.
Shouldn't you ask the government that?
I am the government, and I'm asking you.
Let me.
Mm, you're brave.
They say that sea urchin's the ultimate acquired taste.
It's a personal favorite of mine.
I think people are put off by how it feeds through its bottom.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm from MI-7. Sorry. I'm a secret agent. I am sorry.
- Everything set, Bough? - Just about, sir.
Actually, sir, do you mind if I run through the plan one more time?
No, no. These are the two buildings here.
This one is our target, Sauvage's headquarters,
right next to the City Hospital.
I jump first and land on the south side of the roof,
abseil down 14 floors and cut through this window here.
English: I then land on the east side of the roof and abseil down 12 floors.
Bough: Where you wait for my signal that I've disabled the alarm system.
- Yes. - You then break into this window here,
work your way along the secure corridor and penetrate Sauvage's office.
- Yes, yes. - Is that okay, sir?
It's been okay ever since I thought up the idea, Bough.
Oh, I nearly forgot, sir. Your laser beacon.
- My what? - Your laser beacon!
It'll guide you onto Sauvage's building.
Your dependence on hardware really does amuse me, Bough.
I've been dropped into the Kalahari Desert
carrying nothing more than a toothbrush and a packet of sherbet lemons,
and I still found my way to Bulawayo before Ramadan.
So thank you, Bough, but no thank you.
Bough, go!
Geronimo!
Fandango!
Right.
Alarm's disabled, sir.
Roger that, Bough.
This is worse than I thought, Bough.
Sauvage has got some kind of laboratory set up here.
God knows what kind of sick operation he's running.
My God, what have they done to you?
They've taken some of my blood.
Bastards.
It's only for tests.
Of course it is. Come on, my friend. Let's get you out of here before they take anything else.
Good evening, Dr. Frankenstein.
This way, please. Come on, come on. I haven't got all night.
And you, you angels of death.
About turn. Come on, let's go.
Come on, come on. Keep moving.
Come on. Over there. I know what you're doing here.
Come on. Over there. I know what you're doing here. And you! Come on. Quicker. Quicker.
Come on. Over there.
Now then, perhaps you could direct me to your evil paymaster.
What are you talking about? You know exactly what I'm talking about.
Where is the office of Pascal Sauvage?
Are you coming over here in a minute, sir?
I'm from MI-7.
This has been a test of your emergency response systems,
and I have to say, you've all done extremely well.
Right. Well, I'll leave you to it. And, uh... get well soon.
Oh, God!
Sir. Sir.
Did you just land on the wrong building?
I did a precautionary sweep of the immediate environment.
Right.
- And everything was fine. - Good.
Okay, let's go.
I'll be downstairs at the reception...
That's far enough.
Well, good evening. Perhaps you'd like to have this as well.
- What is it? - Let me show you.
Well executed, Bough, but completely redundant.
How do you mean, sir? Super-strength muscle relaxant.
When he wakes up, he'll be as floppy as a damp old sock.
What's this?
That's the face of the Archbishop of Canterbury.
What are they doing?
What's this got to do with the Crown Jewels?
Bough.
Sauvage: English.
A people whose empire once covered one quarter of the surface of the earth.
Alas, no longer.
Now, my friends ask me, "Pascal, how can you be so interested
in such a backward, grotty little country?"
My answer is simple-- the Queen.
The Queen has more power in her tiny white gloves
The Queen has more power in her tiny white gloves than any other head of state in the entire world.
She can declare war or make peace, and most intriguingly,
she can seize any piece of land which takes her fancy.
Of course, the Queen never uses the enormous power afforded to her.
But imagine someone who would use that power.
Imagine, say, me.
How could he do that, sir? How could he make himself King?
How could he do that, sir? How could he make himself King? The Archbishop.
The Archbishop. ( door closes )
Hands up. There's a good fellow.
Heavily armed for a late night at the office,
wouldn't you say, Bough? You fool, English.
You fool, English. You'll never get out of the building alive.
I'd save your breath for my questioning.
I'm not telling you anything.
Incorrect.
Sodium pentothal.
I won't lie to you. It's a truth serum.
I won't lie to you. It's a truth serum. Now then, why does Sauvage want to have himself crowned?
You have no idea what's going on here, do you?
It would be funny if it wasn't so ( babbles ).
What? ( babbles )
- He's talking gibberish, sir. - Yes, I can hear that, Bough.
- He's collapsed onto me, sir. - Yes, I can see that, Bough.
You don't think you could've got the syringes mixed up, - do you, sir? - What do you mean?
Given the guard outside the truth serum and given Klein the muscle relaxant?
Ah! Don't be ridiculous, Bough. I think I know my right from my left.
- Sir? - Oh, bugger it!
Bough, take ( babbles ).
Take what, sir?
( babbles ) I'm not quite getting that second word, sir.
Schlage! - Write it down, sir. - Schlage!
Yes! Schlage!
"C! C-A..."
"C! C-A..." Car! Take the car! We didn't come by car, sir. We came by plane.
( both babbling ) Bugger off!
Hold it right there.
What's wrong with them? They got their-- I'm not telling you.
Wrong answer.
What is it with you two?
Let's get out of here.
Sorry, but who are you, exactly?
Special Agent Campbell. I'm attached to Interpol in Paris.
I'm attached to Interpol in Paris. We've been watching Sauvage for months.
Why?
Because every major convict released from a Sauvage prison in the last six months
has been employed by one of his companies.
We believe he's recruiting them for a major criminal conspiracy.
We just don't know what yet. ( slurred ) Pegasus!
- What did he say? - Pegasus!
- What did he say? - Pegasus! We have to report to Pegasus!
Oh, no, sir. No, no, no, no!
Oh, no, sir. No, no, no, no! - How do we get out of here? - Hey, you!
- How do we get out of here? - Hey, you!
What you did to me really hurt.
Yeah. Sorry about that. How do we get out of here without being seen?
Okay.
Left by the water fountain, right by the fire exit,
then to the elevator at the end. - Thank you. - Oh, my God.
- Thank you. - Oh, my God.
Nice job, Bough.
Left, sir. Left!
Sir, you can't go to Sauvage's reception in this state.
Sir, you can't go to Sauvage's reception in this state. The effect of the drug has practically worn off, Bough.
I'm fline.
Monsieur.
Ah! Thank you.
- Would sir like another? - Please.
Thank you.
What in God's name?
Ah! Foreign Sebletarary.
Ah! Shall we dance?
- Excuse me, sir? - Yes, Bough?
- Excuse me, sir? - Yes, Bough? I'm very sorry to interrupt. I need to--
Ah, Pascal, how nice to see you again.
Ah, Pascal, how nice to see you again. - Enjoying the party? - Oh, splendid affair.
- Enjoying the party? - Oh, splendid affair. I was until I was informed that your man English
and his curious boyfriend here have spent the evening
breaking into my office and assaulting my staff.
Is this true, Bough?
Well, we-- we--
What in God's name do you think you're up to?
- Well-- - Sir, if I could just offer--
Go home, Bough!
Now!
I gave you direct orders not to meddle with Sauvage.
What do you do? You break into his office and assault two of his staff.
Then you march in here loaded with God only knows what
and insult the foreign secretary.
I haven't encountered such behavior in Whitehall - in 30 years. - But--
- in 30 years. - But-- There are no "buts," English.
You're off the case.
Your security clearance is hereby cancelled.
After a three-month leave of absence, you will return at your old grade.
And I hope never to hear your name again.
Sauvage: English has seen too much.
We go to plan "B."
Get rid of the fake Archbishop and green-light the visit to Her Majesty.
and green-light the visit to Her Majesty. And then this pathetic country can humiliate itself
by crowning me officially.
That's a letter of abdication renouncing your claims to the throne
your claims to the throne and the claims of your entire family.
Sign it.
Never.
- Yes? - Man: Prime Minister, I'm sorry to call so late,
- Yes? - Man: Prime Minister, I'm sorry to call so late, but I'm afraid the Queen has abdicated.
What?!
Abdicated? But that's not possible.
I only wish that were true.
You know what, let me talk to her.
- Maybe she just--  - Pascal, she's gone.
Now, my people have spent the last 10 hours
trying to track down the rightful heir to the throne
and they've come up with a name, which they've double-checked.
Who is it?
It's you.
No!
Male reporter: In the wake of the return of the Crown Jewels
to a police station in North London,
Pascal Sauvage has requested that his coronation
take place this Thursday.
In the House, the prime minister said he was looking forward to the ceremony and he believed that Monsieur Sauvage
and he believed that Monsieur Sauvage will make a fine king and will bring all that is best
will make a fine king and will bring all that is best about modern Europe to our ancient institution.
Get your car keys. We've got work to do.
Miss Campbell.
Sauvage is heading back to his chateau in France.
And he's invited 13 of the richest criminal masterminds in the world to meet him there.
criminal masterminds in the world to meet him there.
I'm sorry, Miss Campbell. I'm off the case.
It's been reassigned.
I know. Reassigned to me.
Look, I want you with me, Johnny. Look, just leave me alone.
What are you gonna do? Sit here in this grotty flat feeling sorry for yourself?
Or are you gonna get out there and save your country?
I'm gonna sit in the flat.
Johnny, this is ridiculous. I'm a spent force.
Spent, my ass.
Will you please stop?
I'll just be a minute.
It'll be nightfall in an hour. Then we can strike out for the chateau.
The fact is, the moment Sauvage gets that crown on his head,
he'll be able to do whatever he likes with the country that I love,
and that is why you and I have got to stop him.
Relishing the thought?
Something like that.
I suppose you've made love to lots of women, haven't you, Johnny?
Um... you know... one does one's best.
It's just...
well, it's been three years since my fiancé left me, and, well, since then,
and, well, since then, I haven't made love to anyone.
But then I met you.
And I felt this... hunger
deep down inside.
I wanted to say things to you.
I wanted to do things to you
that I haven't wanted to do in a very, very, very long time.
What, uh...
What sort of things are we talking about?
Things like punching you in the face.
Things like kicking you in the backside
for being such a pompous, know-nothing asshole.
But then I started to see beyond the idiot that everybody else saw.
I started to see the man on the inside,
a man who was determined to do his duty, no matter what or who lay in his way.
And I began to feel other things for him,
to wanna do other things for him.
Things...
involving plastic toys and soft cheese?
What?
What? What?
You're toying with me, aren't you?
You're telling me to stop in the gentlest way you know how.
No. No, no-- You're such a special person, Johnny,
not to take advantage of me while I'm vulnerable.
No. Well-- So thank you for being such a gentleman.
So thank you for being such a gentleman.
Not at all.
I know what you're thinking, Miss Campbell.
You're thinking, "If we don't pull this off, God knows what might happen to England."
Actually, I was thinking there must be a better way in than that pipe.
Well, there isn't.
I've analyzed it from every possible angle, and this is the best option.
I'll go in first,
and if there's a clear way through, I'll call down, okay?
Johnny?
Be careful.
I'm always careful.
Gentlemen.
In a few hours' time, I will become the next King of England.
No.
How did you get here? Up the ladder.
Look, pull yourself together. It's only a bit of poo.
It's cold! Oh! It's cold! Cold!
What is the one commodity the world never seems to run out of?
Criminals, gentlemen.
Lawbreakers.
Every nation in the world struggles with the issue of overcrowded prisons.
So what do we do with all these villains?
Find the solution to that problem, and the governments of the world
and the governments of the world would pay you through their nose.
Fortunately, I have found a solution.
We empty every prison on the entire planet,
we take the resulting tidal wave of human scum and we put it here.
of human scum and we put it here.
The moment I am crowned King,
I will turn England into the largest prison
in the history of the world.
210,000 square miles of prime real estate,
conveniently separated from true civilization
by 20 miles of ocean and soon to be available
for the entire world to dump its human waste in.
According to current projections,
we will not run out of prison space for the next 500 years.
So, tonight, one, and only one, of you
will leave here owning 49% of this venture.
So that's his little game. We must get hold of that DVD.
So that's his little game. We must get hold of that DVD. But how, Johnny? There's only two of us.
You're young, Miss Campbell, and inexperienced.
What you seem to have forgotten is that ( over PA ) nobody knows we are here.
At our disposal, we have the vital element of surprise.
Now, my plan is simple but effective.
I shall drop from the gallery at this end of the room
and take Sauvage prisoner.
You will then enter from the far door, cutting off any means of escape.
Then using Sauvage as a hostage, we'll get the hell out of here, clear?
Get 'em up, you French ponce.
But, Mr. English, I'm gobsmacked!
What an unexpected surprise.
Surprises are very much my specialty, Sauvage.
I think we've seen enough of this.
I know exactly what you're planning,
and I'm here to put a stop to it.
My bottom will be king of England before you are.
Wrong again.
Perhaps you'd care to look behind you.
Oh, please.
Lorna!
I'm sorry, Johnny.
Well, I'm afraid that we'll have to conclude the floor show for tonight.
Not so fast, Sauvage.
You may have taken me, but you'll never take England.
Not as long as I have breath in my body or a bullet in my gun.
You know, Mr. English, I'm going to miss you. Really.
You're very entertaining. I thank you.
Take them away.
Male announcer:  Good morning, everybody!
( speaks French ) And welcome to "The Breakfast Show." ( speaks French )
As the crowds are gathering here for the crowning
As the crowds are gathering here for the crowning of our first French king since the year 1066,
of our first French king since the year 1066, we asked you to call us here at London FM
we asked you to call us here at London FM with the top 10 things you most love about the French.
We haven't had any calls yet, uh, at all, but the lines are still open,
but the lines are still open, and I'll give you that number again ( speaks French ). 0-2-0-7, zéro, deux, zéro, sept.
This is not good, Johnny.
We've got to think of something.
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.
Hop! Hop!
Hop! And hop! And stop!
Hop! And hop! And stop! Now, are you familiar with the shaman throat warblers of the Guatemalan delta?
What?
It has long been their belief that a whistle pitched
It has long been their belief that a whistle pitched at the precise resonant frequency of a metal lock
will vibrate the levers in such a way that the door will simply swing open.
Unbelievable.
And kneel.
Right. Here goes.
- I can't hear anything. - I'm into ultrasonic.
Johnny, will you just stop all this and face facts? We've failed.
The only thing that can save us now is a miracle.
( lock clicks ) It worked!
Oh! Sir?
I don't know why you hauled yourself up that dreadful poo tube, Bough,
when there's a perfectly good ladder right beside it.
Now, Sauvage may have fooled the country
with his fake Archbishop and his secret agenda,
but he hasn't fooled me.
So, here's the plan.
Sirs, you are hereby called to witness the anointing
Sirs, you are hereby called to witness the anointing of your one true lord and future king, Pascal.
Pascal, are you willing to take the oath?
I am willing.
Then be thou anointed with this holy oil.
And do you, the chosen bishops of England, Scotland and Wales,
assent to this anointing?
For Scotland, I do.
For Wales, I do.
For England, I do not!
( crowd gasps and murmurs )
English! That man must not be crowned King
because he is a fraudster, a charlatan, and a thief!
No, please. Let him speak.
It is this man, Pascal Sauvage, who stole the Crown Jewels,
Who forced the Queen to abdicate,
Who forced the Queen to abdicate, and would kill anyone who got in his way.
It is the end, Herr English.
He has cheated, conned, and manipulated this great country for his own ends.
this great country for his own ends. He's fooled you all!
What's more, this whole ceremony is a sham
because that man standing in front of you
is not the Archbishop of Canterbury!
English, a word of advice. Don't go there.
Shut it, Frenchy. I'll go wherever I damn well please.
- Now, take it off. - What?
- Now, take it off. - What? Your face is made of plastic.
Your face is made of plastic.
Remove it at once.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Right. Well, I'll just have to remove it myself.
Come on! ( grunting and muttering )
( grunting and muttering ) Maybe it pulls up from the front.
Come on, will you!
Thank you very much.
Must be a join here somewhere.
Sauvage: Fascinating performance as always, Mr. English,
but I'm afraid we must move on.
Nobody's moving anywhere until I'm finished with this piece of low-life.
Do you or do you not have tattooed on your bottom the words
"Jesus is coming. Look busy"?
Are you insane?
Well, let's find out, shall we?
Go on, over. Go on, let's have a look.
- ( laughter ) - Excellent!
All right, so I was wrong about the Archbishop's bottom.
But there's more!
But not, I'm afraid, today.
Sergeant, please take this man away.
But be gentle with him.
Do you think that's it? What, do you think I don't have more evidence?
My loyal subordinate is standing by with a DVD
which shows Sauvage's hideous plan for this country!
Get him out! Get him out of here!
Play it, Bough! Play the disc!
Play it! Now!
Well, shall we?
Then, as Solomon was anointed King
by Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet,
so be thou anointed and consecrated King...
over all the peoples whom the Lord thy God
hath given thee to govern
and of all your possessions, wherever they may be.
And so, in the name of the Father
and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost,
I crown you...
Damn it!
- Give it back! - No!
- Give it back! - No! - That is my crown! - Never!
Give it back!
Never in a million years, Sauvage!
- Give it to me! - Bugger off.
- Give it back! - ( crowd gasps )
- Pascal! - Shut up!
All this stupid little country have to do is stand in line
and do what it's told for one miserable day!
But can it do that?!
My fragrant French ass, it can!
Give it! The crown! The crown! Go!
And so, in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
I crown you...
King.
What?
Arrest that man
and lock him away!
Queen: Words can hardly express just how much we appreciate everything you've done.
Nothing more than my duty, ma'am.
And in return, is there anything that your Queen and country can do for you?
Well...
since one is asking, ma'am.

Come with us, Ed. Fly, Ed, fly!
Ah... ah... I'm flying with fast food!
Whoo! Whee! Whoa, flying with hamburgers!

Oh! A clock!
Hey, hey, Alfalfa!
Would you please take my order?
Ooh, sorry, no can do. I'm the drive-thru guy. You need the counter guy.
I'm the drive-thru guy. You need the counter guy.
Hey, where's Ed?
Whoa, wait--

Um, sorry! My bad, uh...

You think I'm kidding? Five...

Welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger. Can I take your order?
Well, it's about time. Can I get two Good Burgers?
Oh, sorry, dude, I have to go get 'em. Customers aren't allowed in back.
Just give me two Good Burgers!
Dude, I just can't give you two Good Burgers. You have to pay for 'em.
Forget it! Forget it! I've had it up to here with Good Burger!
I can't wait for Mondo Burger to open.
Mondo Burger? What's Mondo Burger?
Ed, you see that giant building there across the street?
The one that they've been building for ten months?
Oh, I see it. Huh. That's Mondo Burger, Ed.
Yeah, they open in, like, three days. Cool! Huh.
It's not cool, Ed. They're competition.
Big competition. Yep. They could put us out of business.
Yep. They could put us out of business.
That's right. What are we gonna do then? All right, now, come on!
Good Burger has been here for over 40 years.
People love us.
-Most of us. -Huh.
And nobody is putting Good Burger out of business!
-Yeah! Yeah! -Nobody. -Yeah! -Yeah! Huh.
All right, people, two more minutes before the end of the test.
I know what you're thinking, my brother! "Why?"
"Why would this man give us a test on the last day of school before summer starts?"
-I'm going to tell you why. Because... -[bangs desk]
...the mind never sleeps.
Can I get a witness?
[boy] Out of here. [Dexter singing] ♪ Summer vacation, bow-chicka-bow ♪
What's your hurry, my brother?
My hurry is that it's now officially summer vacation
and yet, I'm still looking at you.
You're an amazing student.
I mean, you sit there, you get your test done first and you were concentrating so hard, I thought you were asleep.
and you were concentrating so hard, I thought you were asleep.
-Next time make it more challenging. -That's what I want to talk about.
Challenges, potential, using your mind, 'cause I'm worried about you.
I'm worried about you, too. Have you seen yourself lately?
The 'fro, the boots, and this jacket...
You have a nice summer, Shaft.
[Jake] Yo, Dex, wait up.
So, uh, how you think you did on your exam?
Sorry, summer vacation started 48 seconds ago.
That means that school, work or anything of that nature
is now officially off limits for the next three months.
Nice car. This yours? No, it's my mom's,
but she's away on business in New York.
And she lets you drive this while she's out of town?
-Nope. -[engine starting]
Ed! Ed-- Spatch, will you move?
Ed, we have a delivery. -But I don't do deliveries. -You do for the time being.
-But I don't do deliveries. -You do for the time being. -I fired O'Malley. -How come?
-I fired O'Malley. -How come? Because the boy showed up to work without his pants.
Now, please, make this delivery. The address is on the back. Oh.
It shall be delivered.
So what's your plan for the summer?
Ha! Let me tell you, boy, I plan to wake up every day at around noon,
then I'm going to lay out by the pool, order some Chinese food,
maybe invite some fine females over to share an egg roll or two.
Then I'm going to wake up the next day, do it all over again.
Ha, ha! Know what I'm saying? Say, man, you're lucky.
My folks is making me get a summer job. See, that's it right there.
You got to explain things to parents. Like summer vacation.
The key word there is "va-ca-tion."
See what I'm saying?
-[Jake] Look out! -Whoa!
Just get off the...
My Afro. My Afro!
Why?
Oh, brother Reed, you have messed up my Afro.
All right, don't worry, bro. Just be cool and let me handle this.
All right, Jake?
Oh, no.
Oh, baby. Oh!
Oh, no.
Oh! Oh, my grill.
Oh, Black Beauty, oh... Oh!
Oh! See, when I left school today
I didn't think I was gonna run into you this summer.
Or I didn't think you was gonna run into me.
I mean, just run into me like this.
You're in trouble with me, young man. You're in trouble with me!
No, listen, Mr. Wheat, listen. It wasn't my fault.
See, this nut on some roller blades,
he skated into my vision sight. I couldn't see nothing, so I swerved...
-Roller blades? -We was spinning around like that...
-I don't want to hear it! -...and then I couldn't control it...
I don't want to hear it. -Know how much that car cost me? -No.
-Know how much that car cost me? -No. -Do you know? -No.
That's a $22,000 car. $22,000! And that's just the base price!
$22,000! And that's just the base price! Check out the chrome, see? I waited four weeks for the chrome!
Check out the chrome, see? I waited four weeks for the chrome! You can't get chrome wheels at base price!
See that leather? That's Detroit leather. That's Detroit leather.
You gotta order Detroit leather from Detroit! Huh? What's that tell you?
They always get you with them extras. [chuckles]
-Give me your driver's license. -Um...
Give me your driver's license.
Um, regarding my driver's license, I'd give it to you, but you're going to have to wait.
For what? -Oh, about a year. -Oh, no.
That's when I get one. -No... -When they put it in my hand.
-No... -When they put it in my hand.
-You don't have a driver's license? -No.
I know you don't have no insurance, do you? I hate to do this, young man, I hate to put a black man in jail,
I hate to do this, young man, I hate to put a black man in jail,
-but I'm gonna have to call the police. -Black man in jail?
You ain't got the... I'm just a kid. No, no, no, not the police. Don't call the police.
No, no, no, not the police. Don't call the police. No, please, don't call them.
Please, don't call the police!
They can't find out I was driving without a license, sir, please.
No, please, let me fix it. Just let me fix it, please.
-You shouldn't have been driving. -No, let me fix it!
-All right. -All right?
Yeah, all right. Yeah. Yeah, I'll let you fix the car.
So, uh, how much you think it's going to cost to fix?
$1,900? I don't have $1,900.
That's all right. Maybe your parents will help you out. -I'll just give them a call... -Ooh, um, wait. I'll get the money.
-I'll just give them a call... -Ooh, um, wait. I'll get the money. You can't get the money.
I know you got a summer, you just want to be free.
-We'll just call... -No, wait, wait, wait, wait. I will... I'll...
I'll get a summer job.
[Griffin] Bun, patty, topping, sauce, assemble.
Bun, patty, topping, sauce, assemble.
Bun, patty, topping, sauce, assemble...
Come here, little bun. Oh, beef patty.
Okay, yeah. Ooh, that's nasty. All right.
Yo, my man, can I borrow some lettuce?
-Can I borrow some... -[whistle blowing]
-You. -Who?
You! Look at this mess. I-- I can explain.
See, I was trying to put the big old beef patty...
on the bottom half of the bun, you know, before the tomato gets all slippery
with the... Ooh, that's slippery.
Oh, I'm sorry. And then, you know,
the pickle bits was making me do the wrong...
Because they're... they're flexible, they're not crunchy. And...
Yo, man, back me up on this.
-[blows whistle] -Oh, again with the whistle. Shut up. Just be quiet.
It'd be a lot more quiet if you stopped blowing the whistle.
Watch your mouth, you pestiferous little maggot.
Now, I'm familiar with the term "maggot" but... pestiferous?
Burn this into the front row of your brain, Chuckles.
If there's one thing Kurt cannot stand
it is an incompetent, bumbling, sloppy, fast food employee.
Ed! What are you doing inside the milkshake machine?
Oh, trying to fix it. Did you turn on the switch?
No.
Strawberry Jacuzzi.
People, I'm fully stoked about being in charge of every single one of you.
Within two years, Mondo Burger's going to be the biggest burger chain on this planet.
Oh, yeah.
First we got to beat out our big competition across the street, -Good Burger. -[both laughing]
From now on, your life is Mondo Burger.
You can forget about your friends, you can forget about your family,
because Kurt... is now both your mother and your father.
Kurt must look awfully strange naked.
Who said that? Who talked while Kurt was talking?
It was him. He uttered something.
Why, I should've known. Uh, I'm sorry I uttered.
You think you're funny, don't you, bro? You know what? At Mondo Burger, there are no comedians.
You know what? At Mondo Burger, there are no comedians.
You mess with Kurt and you go into the grinder.
Okay, now this grinder of yours, is it a real grinder or is it some kind of a metaphor?
That's it, you're gone! Adios, TKO, historical.
Wait, wait, wait. I won't be funny no more. See?
Security!
You ain't gotta bring the man down here. Wait a second.
Kurt, come on, please, I need this job.
Take out the trash. "Trash"? Oh, now, look'ee here...
"Trash"? Oh, now, look'ee here... Get this loser out of my face!
"Loser"? Now you about to push me a little too far.
-You want a piece of me? -Yeah, extra crispy, please.
Oh, see, you lucky you brought your friends down here.
Hey, man, is this really necessary? Kurt, please! I need this job!
[whimpering] Please, I need this job. Please.
Excuse me.
Look, I ordered one Good Burger with nothing on it.
That's what I gave you. No, you gave me a bun.
Just a bun. Look, there's no meat in here.
But you said you wanted nothing on it. Yes, well, I expected a meat patty!
Dude, a meat patty is something. You said nothing.
Fizz, is a meat patty something or nothing? Uh... something?
Uh... something?
-I win! -All right, that rips it. I am reporting your name to the manager!
The manager already knows my name.
Oh, I'll see you in hell! Okay. See you there.
Such a nice guy. I don't know why he had to throw the bread everywhere.
I mean, jeez.
-One more Good Shake. -Good, good, keep them coming.
Um, dude, don't you think you've had enough?
Hey, you look familiar. Don't I know you from somewhere?
-Ever been to Australia? -No.
Me neither.
I could've sworn I seen you someplace before.
Hey, I know. Maybe I'm someone famous.
You know, like a baseball player, or a pretty nurse. Huh.
What? Man, what in the world are you talking about?
Okay, okay, I give up. Who am I?
I don't know who you are, or where I know you from,
or why you think you're an attractive nurse.
But I am sure I don't want to know you any longer.
Now, please, go away. I've had a very bad day.
What's wrong? Were you bitten by a sheep?
What?
-Did you lose your trousers? -No!
Look, you're an unusually bad guesser, so I'm going to go ahead and tell you why I'm upset.
I got to come up with $1,900 to fix some jerk's car,
another $800 to fix my mother's car, and I just got fired.
[sighs] Man. I can't believe Kurt fired me from Mondo Burger.
I mean, he yelled at me, then he insulted me.
He made fun of me.
Boy, you must really suck.
See, right about now, I'd slap you in your head, but I'm not quite sure that your brain would understand the concept of pain.
but I'm not quite sure that your brain would understand the concept of pain.
Hey! Want to see my belly button?
Well, it was very unusual to meet you... Ed.
I'm going to go now and try to beg someone for a summer job, man. Bye.
Wait. You could work here at Good Burger.
-Here? -Yeah. Hey, Mr. Baily, this guy needs a job. -Could he have one? -No!
-Could he have one? -No!
-See ya. -Wait, wait, wait. Come on, Mr. Baily, he really needs one.
Come on, Mr. Baily, he really needs one. -He can do fries. -Otis does fries.
-He can do fries. -Otis does fries. Yeah, but look at him.
How much longer could he possibly live?
Well...
Have you ever worked in fast food before, uh...
Uh, Dexter. Dexter Reed. And yes, I have worked in fast food.
Yeah? How long? -Nearly two days. -[chuckles] Oh, well...
-Nearly two days. -[chuckles] Oh, well...
Do you know how to drive a motor vehicle?
Yes. I'm an excellent driver.
Any accidents on your record? Not to your knowledge.
[sighs] All right, Dexter. I'm going to give you a shot.
You're on deliveries, and you may have to pitch in and do some counter work.
Okay. Cool! I'll teach him everything I know! Oh, God help me.
I won't let you down.
Hey, Fizz. This is Dexter.
Fizz works drive-thru. Well, hi-de-ho, Dex.
Uh, hi-de-ho, Fi. "Fi"? Wow, nobody's ever abbreviated my name before.
"Fi"? Wow, nobody's ever abbreviated my name before. I love that.
Hey, and that's Otis. Huh.
He's 77 years old and still works in fast food.
I should've died years ago. -Tough break. -[Ed] And there's Deedee.
-Tough break. -[Ed] And there's Deedee. She's a veterinarian.
-Vegetarian. -Oh.
That means she doesn't eat fur. I won't wear fur. I don't eat meat.
I won't wear fur. I don't eat meat.
Hey, uh, Ed, what is that? Oh, that's just Spatch.
Let me show you. Come here. Huh.
Hey, Spatch. -[gasps] -[gasps]
Uh, Spatch isn't much of a "people person." Huh.
You want to rinse that off?
Well, hello. My name is Dexter. I'm your new coworker.
Monique.
Well, that's a nice outfit you got on there.
Those stripes really bring out the color of your eyes.
Yes. You can imagine how embarrassed I was when I came to work
and saw everyone wearing the same thing.
Oh, I-I guess I'll see you later then. Guess you will.
Yo, man, who was that? She is all that.
All what? Never mind.
So, tell me, what am I going to be making my deliveries in? A van, a truck?
There she is, the Burger Mobile. Huh.
Think you can handle her? I don't know. I never driven a sandwich before.
I don't know. I never driven a sandwich before. [Ed] Ha. Huh. Come on, I'll take you for a spin.
-[Dexter] A'ight. -[Ed] Huh.
Now, uh, you can drive, right? I mean, you can read all the signs and stuff?
Yeah! Now this is what I call fast food! Huh!
-Whoa, whoa! Hey, look out for-- -[horn honking]
That was a stop sign!
Uh... no.
[whimpering] Oh, man.
Watch out for the...!
Get back here!
Closing time at last.
[Dexter] All right, let me see.
Five dollars an hour, six hours a day, five days a week.
I should be able to pay off the car in, uh...
Oh, another lifetime!
Man! This place is the most nauseating, pathetic hole I have ever seen.
I mean, what kind of diseased maggot would even consider eating here?
Welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger. Can I take your order? Huh.
Check it, boys. Right back there.
It's the reject.
Hey, check it, Ed. It's the Mondo idiot!
Oh, well, nice to meet you, Mondo Idiot. I'm Ed. Huh.
Well, Ed, you better watch your butt, man.
-Look, you got a purpose for being here? -Yeah, I do.
I just thought you Good Burger losers should be aware
that tonight is the grand opening of Mondo Burger.
The second we open our doors, Good Burger goes in the grinder.
Again with this grinder.
Look, man, you either order something, or you can get out of here.
Yeah. Sure. You can take my order.
I'll have the very last Good Burger to go.
Oh, I give up. There is no way a guy can watch his own butt. Oh!
Is everybody liking my party?
And now...
I'm psyched to present to you people, Mondo Burger!
And now, people, welcome to Mondo Burger.
[Dexter] Um, Mr. Baily?
Since we don't have any customers, or electricity...
I suppose we should all just, uh, go on home.
[Griffin] Looks like Good Burger closed early tonight.
Yep. And it think pretty soon, they'll be closed for good.
♪ I've got one opposable... ♪ Everybody, I got one.
-Got one, what? -What? What?
A Mondo Burger.
All right, all right, everybody. Now, don't get all excitable.
-Holy Mackerel. -[gasping] It's huge.
Look at that.
And I don't know how they do it, but they charge the same amount as we do for a Good Burger.
How do they do it? They just use more meat.
Oh, poor cows.
-Hand me a Good Burger. -[grunts]
They sound similar.
Come on, what was our take today? $43.09.
That's it?
I suppose I can always feed my mother cat food.
Now probably wouldn't be the best time to ask for a raise?
No!
I'm going home. -Good night, people. -Good night, Mr. Baily.
-Good night, people. -Good night, Mr. Baily.
So, Monique, what are you gonna do tonight after you lock up?
I thought I'd go home. Home? Why?
Well, that's where my stuff is.
Stuff. Ha, ha, ha.
-Want to hang out tonight? -I don't know, but--
Hey, Ed, you better be careful.
-You! -Me?
Now I know where I saw you before.
You're the roller-blading nut that caused my accident.
You're the reason why I owe 1,900 bucks.
You're the reason my mom found out I was driving without a license.
Man, you cost me a fortune.
You wrecked my summer, man. You ruined my life.
So, you don't want to hang out tonight?
No. I don't want to hang out with you... ever.
Do you think you can get me to a hospital? I think I broke my ass.
Come on, Otis. Get out of the way.
[Dexter] Oh, man.
Ah, Mr. Reed.
Hard at work as usual. I'm having my lunch.
Well, I just got my car back from the body shop, and I got to admit, good as new.
Here's the receipt.
$2,500?
The estimate was only for $1,900.
Well, that my young brother, is why they call it an estimate.
Close to, kind of, could be. [chuckles]
And I estimate it'll take you about two and half months to get me my money.
You have a good day at work. I'm going to have lunch at Mondo Burger.
Home of the Big Booty Burger. Home of the Big Booty Burger.
Oh, man.
Mind if I sit here? Yes, I do mind. Uh, thanks.
-What are you doing? -Eating my lunch.
I told you not to sit here.
I don't like you. Can't you get that through your head?
I can try.
Nope.
All right, I'm gonna have to spell this out for you.
I don't want to sit by you, I don't want to see you,
I don't want to smell you, I don't want to hang out with you.
I don't even want to use words with the letter "u."
Look, I'm Grape Nose Boy.
-Stop that. -♪ Bluebity, Bluebity, Bluebity... ♪ Would you stop? -♪ Bluebity... ♪ -[stifling laugh]
Uh, that ain't funny. ♪ Bluebity, Bluebity, Bluebity, Blue... ♪
-All right. -♪ Bluebity... ♪
Ha! Made you laugh. So... Oh, I give up.
-Grape? -Uh, no, I'll pass.
Now, I should have figured that lunch with you would be... different.
Hey, what's that goo? Oh, that's my sauce.
I make it myself. -Huh. -You carry your own sauce?
Doesn't everybody?
Hey, hey, would you watch it? Sorry.
Hey, that is kind of good. You sure you made this by yourself?
Yeah. It's my very own recipe. Nobody knows about this, right?
Nope.
-[cash register bell dinging] -Hey, Fizz, come here.
Hi, you guys. What can I...?
Hey, what did you...? Mmm. This is really good. What did you guys put on this?
This is really good. What did you guys put on this?
Deedee, Otis, Monique, come here.
Mom, I gotta call you back.
[Deedee] This is so good. [Mr. Baily] Hey, hey...
Hey! What in the name of ground beef is going on?
Mr. Baily, try this.
Dexter, I don't have time...
-[Deedee] It's good. -Terrific. -[Dexter] Mm-hmm. -This is marvelous. What is it?
-[Dexter] Mm-hmm. -This is marvelous. What is it? A French fry.
I know that, Ed. I'm talking about the sauce.
-What's in the sauce? -Ed's ingredients. He made it himself.
-Ed? -Excellent.
-[Deedee] It's awesome. -It makes me glad I'm not dead.
Ed! If we put that sauce on all the Good Burgers, then everyone will want to eat here.
We'll knock Mondo Burger right off the map. -Whee! That's great. -[Deedee] Yeah!
-Whee! That's great. -[Deedee] Yeah!
Ed, get in that kitchen and start making sauce.
-It shall be done. -[laughter]
Don't let us down. Get me another French fry.
Good Burger's back in business. [all] Yeah!
I've never seen so many customers.
-Good Burger's back in business. -Oh, back in business.
-Move over, Mondo Burger. -Move over. [laughs]
-And Ed? -What?
For every Good Burger we sell, I'm going to give you ten cents for every one!
[laughs] Oh, man.
-A little help here? -Oh, okay, be right there.
No, no, no. I'll help Deedee.
You get in that kitchen and keep making sauce.
Well, Ed, how's that sauce-making coming along?
Oh, pretty good. Mr. Baily says it's gonna save Good Burger.
That's great.
Now, you do remember that it was my idea
to put the sauce on Good Burgers in the first place, right?
Yeah, you should get some of the money I receive.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
In fact, since we're going to be in business together, I thought that maybe we should sign a little contract.
I thought that maybe we should sign a little contract. Just to make our partnership official.
Yeah, okay.
I know some of these words.
Ah. So, what does it all mean, Dexter? Well, it's quite simple, really.
Of all the money that Good Burger makes off your sauce,
you get to keep 20%.
you get to keep 20%. Cool? Okay.
And then I'll keep the other 80%, so it works out cool for both of us.
Okay.
There you go.
-Cool. All right. -[Deedee] Ed?
There must be 50 customers out there. It's unbelievable.
What do you put in that sauce?
Well, you start off with a little lemon juice and some ketchup--
Look, Dexter, I like you as a friend and all, but it might...
-No. Listen to me carefully. -Okay. Do not tell anyone the recipe to your sauce.
Oh. Well, first you start off with a little lemon juice--
Stop it! Stop talking.
Never tell anyone the ingredients of your sauce.
Why? You want to save Good Burger, don't you?
Oh, yeah. Good Burger's my life.
Well, then, you got to keep your sauce recipe a secret. -All right? -Okay.
-Hmm? -You're squishing my pancreas.
-Sorry. -Thanks.
Unbelievable. Two days ago, we had Good Burger crushed.
[Kurt] Now look at 'em. I think it's the sauce, boss.
-[grunts] -Duh. I know that. You think Kurt's stupid?
I want Good Burger out of business. Go find out what's in that sauce.
I'll go get some and have it checked out. [grunts]
Ed, here's your take for the day. $67.00.
-[both laughing] -Thanks for the sauce, kid. -[gasping] -Mmm! [Mr. Baily] Love ya!
Well, here you go, Ed.
You get to keep $13. Whoa! That's almost $14.
Yeah, well, see you tomorrow.
Uh, hey, Dex, uh, what you doing?
You want to hang out or something? Gee, I don't know, I gotta go clean my room.
Gee, I don't know, I gotta go clean my room. -[stutters] I got to... -Please?
-[stutters] I got to... -Please?
-Sure. Let's hang out. -Cool!
Want to see my secret place? That's not what I had in mind.
-Come on! -All right...
[Ed] This is my place.
This is where I come to think. Well, I think.
That's funny, 'cause I never took you for much of a thinker.
Oh, yeah, sure. I think about all kind of things:
Good Burger...
squirrels...
cardboard boxes...
things that are sticky...
I'll bet you don't have one real problem. Um, I got six toes on my left foot.
What kind of problems do you have?
Other than the ones you cause? Lots.
Most of them started when I was a little kid.
That's when my dad left me and my mom.
I must have lived in 15 places since then.
I remember the last time I saw my Dad. I was seven years old,
and for no reason at all, he bought me this yo-yo.
It was so cool. I mean, it wasn't just an ordinary yo-yo.
It had lights that lit up when you yo-yoed it.
Red lights on one side, and blue lights on the other.
And it made this funky, whistling noise, too.
Wow. That sounds like quite a yo-yo. You still got it?
No.
After awhile, it stopped lighting up.
Then it quit making that funky whistling noise.
Then I guess my mom just threw it away.
You know...
I don't even remember what my dad looks like.
I don't remember what my dad looks like, either.
But at least I get to see him every day.
I give up. I'm going home.
Oh, hey, Dex.
Uh, thanks for hanging out with me.
It's no problem. See you tomorrow, buddy.
You mean it?
Mean what? Well, I'm your buddy.
You called me your buddy.
Yeah, sure. I guess so.
See you tomorrow.
Dexter, you got a delivery. You are going to freak.
Hey, Monique, um, check it. I got a delivery to make.
You want to ride with me? Oh, I want to go, I want to go.
Oh, yeah. You can go, Ed.
Oh, man.
Ed, man, you got to park the burger. Slow down.
-Watch it, Steve! -Hey, hey!
Oh, hey, man.
Come on, man, the locker room's this way.
[reporter] So, after scoring that amazing, last-minute, game-winning shot,
and bringing your team all the way to the NBA Championship, how do you feel?
I feel hungry.
Delivery.
Here's your Good Burger. Huh.
Little man, I ordered tomatoes on this Good Burger.
I don't see no tomatoes. [Ed] Well, hang on. Uh...
Consider yourself tomatoed. [laughs]
You're not like other people, are you?
Um, go ahead, Shaq.
Um, go ahead, Shaq. Take a bite of the Good Burger and tell us how you like the good sauce.
Tastes good, tastes good.
You heard it here, folks.
Shaquille O'Neal, a man who enjoys good food.
Huh! Huh! Look, Dex, we're on live TV!
[Ed] Oh, welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger. Can I take your order? Huh. Whoa.
I've never been on TV before.
♪ She's a dude ♪ -♪ And we're all dudes, hey! ♪ -I'm sick of these pukes. Shut up!
Not so fast with the trash talk now, are you, huh?
You got him that time, bro.
Yeah, but if you hadn't noticed, Good Burger is still in business.
[Griffin] Well, what are we supposed to do about it?
Our burgers are already twice the size of theirs.
Kitchen. [man] Y-yes, sir.
Make our burgers bigger. -Bigger? But they're already... -Bigger! Bigger!
-Bigger? But they're already... -Bigger! Bigger!
Now, let's see Good Burger go against burgers three times the size of their own.
Great. But what about the Ed Sauce?
Welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger. Can I take your order?
You all right, bro?
I know you. You're the dude from Mondo Burger.
Correct-a-mundo. Kurt Bozwell.
No, no, no. I'm Ed.
No, no, no. I'm Ed. Can I give you a lift, Ed?
Oh, I don't know, dude. I weigh about 150.
Just get in the car, huh? -Oh, car? -Yeah.
Ed, I'm going to cut right to the chase.
You have been working at Good Burger now for like, what, three years?
And your manager still only pays you five bucks an hour, man.
Really? Cool! Huh.
Well, five bucks an hour's cool... How does... ten bucks sound?
Ten bucks.
[Ed] I don't know.
It sounds sort of like...
I want you to bail on Good Burger, and I want you to come and work for me at Mondo Burger.
and I want you to come and work for me at Mondo Burger.
You make your sauce for Kurt.
-Who's Kurt? -I'm Kurt.
-I'm Ed. -I'm aware!
You said you were Kurt.
Well, thanks for the ride.
Whenever you're ready to come and work for me, you say the word.
What were you doing in Kurt's car?
Oh, you know, just pushing buttons and hanging out. Huh.
[Dexter] What'd he say to you?
Something about working at Mondo Burger. I think he likes me.
Ed! That diphthong doesn't like you! He just wants to use you.
Oh, well, that's not... "natural."
No. He wants your sauce.
Look, don't tell him the sauce recipe, all right?
Because if you do, Good Burger's going to be in big trouble.
-Okay. -All right. -Cool. -Now, let's get to work.
All right. Um, Dex...
Um, I got you something.
What-- What is this?
It's a yo-yo.
I bought it with the $13 you gave me.
It lights up and flickers and everything, just like the one your dad gave you.
Why'd you get this for me?
'Cause we're buds. Huh.
What's with this dude?
He doesn't want to work at Mondo Burger.
If you ask me, the guy's a few tacos short of a combination plate.
I don't care. Now, Kurt's going to get his sauce. I didn't come this far to let some...
tired crap shack like Good Burger get in my way.
Bring in Roxanne.
If anyone can get the sauce out of Ed, she can.
-♪ Roxanne ♪ -Excuse me.
-♪ You don't have to... ♪ -Hello?
Um, welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger. Can I take your order? Huh.
No, thanks. I just came here to see you, Ed.
I'm Roxanne.
Welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger. Can I take your order? Huh.
You are so hot. Oh, well, I often sweat at work. Huh.
So, you hungry?
Yes, I am hungry... but not for food. I'm hungry for you.
Oh, well... well, I'm not edible.
Huh... [chuckles] How would you like to go on date tomorrow night?
With who? Me, silly.
Huh. Me silly, too. -[laughs] -No.
I meant that you and I should go out together tomorrow night.
Want to? Oh, okay. Cool. Awesome.
Here's my address. I'll see you at eight.
I don't believe what I just saw. Who? Elvis?
No, a beautiful girl just strode in here and asked you on a date.
Oh, I know. Hey, want to come? -Oh, no. Three's a crowd, man. -Oh, well, just bring a date.
-Oh, no. Three's a crowd, man. -Oh, well, just bring a date. Hey, why don't you ask Monique.
I... I don't think so.
Now, you know you like her-- huh. How can I not like her?
I mean, she's smart, funny, beautiful... -and cuddly. -[laughs]
Oh, then just ask her out. -No. -What, you chicken?
-No. -What, you chicken? -I'm not a chicken. -[laughing] Are too.
-I'm not a chicken. -[laughing] Are too. Dexter's a chicken!
Chicken! Moo!
I'm not a chicken.
It's just that I don't think she wants to waste her time going out with me.
Chickens...! Chickens don't moo, man.
They cluck.
Hey, Monique, we're all going out tomorrow night.
You wanna be Dexter's date?
-Look, man, I told you-- -I'd love to.
I knew she'd say yes.
♪ Someone who will mention... ♪ Yeah, corn dogs!
Your chair, Madame.
Why, thank you, Dexter.
[Ed] Your chair. Huh!
Um, is your butt okay? It's fine. Thank you.
It's okay, people! Her butt is fine!
-Mmm! That's a great corn dog. -Mm-hmm.
I wonder how they get the weenie into the corny exterior? Yeah.
A question that's plagued mankind for centuries.
You know what'd go great on these corn dogs?
Um... a turtleneck?
[giggles] No, silly. Some of your sauce. I just love your sauce.
How do you make it? I'm dying to know.
Well, first you start off with some ketchup and some lemon juice... Ow!
Oh, what's the matter? Is it your butt? -No. -Uh, oh.
What do you say we start putting? Ooh. I get to go first.
[Dexter] All right. Word. Come on, Roxanne.
Ed... can't we just go somewhere and be alone?
What for?
Well, maybe we could talk.
Or maybe get to know each other a little better.
Now doesn't that sound like more fun than miniature golf?
No! Come on.
Oh... So close yet so far. My turn. Excuse me. Thank you very much.
[grunting] All righty. -Oh... -Huh.
[whispers] Okay, yeah.
All right. You're all right.
So, uh, is this your first time? -Uh-huh, keep talking. -Mm-hmm.
Huh. Okay, my turn.
-[grunts] -Fore!
Your turn.
Then when I was six, I said my first words.
My mom thinks it was "trousers," but I think it was "tweezers."
-Then I went to camp and fell down a... -Ed... Ed!
She's still unconscious, bro.
What happened? Your head hit my golf ball.
Then you went sleepy-bye.
Um... Monique, you want to take a walk? -Sure. -Wait, wait, wait.
-Sure. -Wait, wait, wait. What am I supposed to do?
Hello. What am I supposed to do?
Ed, I think Roxanne can, uh, help you figure something out.
So, Ed... what do you want to do?
Well, I always wanted to shave a Martian.
Got a Martian. Huh!
Here you go. Thank you.
So, uh, you like me? Of course.
[mockingly] So, uh... you like me? Are you kidding?
I liked you from the first time I saw you, right off the bat.
But I guess it was the same for you, too, huh?
No, actually, I thought you were self-centered and obnoxious.
Well, so much for my self-esteem.
I changed my mind, didn't I? Yes, you did. How come?
Ed. Excuse me.
Ed thinks you're a really great guy.
He's always talking about what a good friend you are to him...
and what a nice and caring person you are.
Really? Ed said all that?
Ed is the sweetest, most genuine person I've ever met.
And, uh, anybody he likes that much... can't be all bad.
Look at me, Ed. I'm looking.
What do you see?
That big red lump on your forehead where the golf ball hit you.
Huh! Look into my eyes, Ed.
Tell me how you make your sauce... and I'll give you anything you want.
Uh, whatcha got?
For starters... how about this?
Sorry. You surprised me.
Can you breathe?
I quit!
I'm guessing she didn't get the sauce recipe.
I'm aware.
Hello. My name is Connie Mondune.
I'm hosting a family reunion and my oven has run amok!
-Huh. -I think it's the heat actuator.
Anywho, I'd like to order, uh three Good Meals, four Junior Good Meals,
and 17 orders of your Good Chunks.
On two of the Junior Good Meals,
I need to substitute the Good Cookies for Good Pies.
Now don't fret if that's extra. I'll pony up the overage.
And on the Regular Good Meals, I need two of the Good Burgers
to have ketchup, mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, but no onion.
I've got an interview this afternoon.
That takes care of everyone but Uncle Leslie, who doesn't eat meat,
but does eat dairy, so I don't get it.
Let's get him a Good Chick with Good Fries and a Good Root Beer.
All to go. But I'd like to have my beverage while I wait.
Now, total me up!
Guess who.
Hi, Dexter. Hey. What you doing?
Getting ready for work. Oh, cool, cool.
Um, listen, since we had such a nice time last night,
uh, I thought that maybe we could do it again tonight.
I don't think so.
Okay. Tomorrow night, then? No.
Well, maybe this weekend? Maybe not.
Okay. Who are you and what have done with the real Monique?
Oh, she's right here. It's just that now, she knows the real Dexter.
Come again?
-You forgot your jacket last night. -Oh. Thank you.
And this fell out of the pocket.
Oh, um... this? This is just, all it is...
All it is... Right, it's just the contract you had Ed sign.
You know, the one where you take most of his money.
The money he's supposed to get for his sauce.
No... yeah. But, look, I was just trying...
You know, I can't believe that you would do something like that
to someone who trusts you.
How can you take advantage of a sweet person like Ed?
And after he got you a job?
It ain't even like that. -I only wanted-- -Oh, I know what you wanted.
-I only wanted-- -Oh, I know what you wanted. You're not Ed's friend.
You're just using him to scam a little cash on the side.
It must feel really good.
-Babe... -Oh, but don't worry.
I'm not going to tell Ed that you're cheating him.
Why not? Because it would hurt him too much.
Punk.
There you are, Ed. Um, can I sit here?
On my lap? No, man.
I'll just sit down right next to you.
All right, look, Ed, I don't know how to say this...
Oh, you just go: "This."
No, um, I'm talking about this contract.
-[barking] -What is it, boy?
-Oh, wha...? What? -[barks]
Four clowns?
Their car's broken down?
They're in trouble?
Man, that dog is not talking to you. Wait, hang on.
He's trying to tell us that there's four clowns stuck somewhere
and their car broke down.
Where, boy, where?
Ed, there are no clowns. Man, that dog is just hungry.
Oh, well, maybe we should feed him.
Here, have a Mondo Burger.
Huh. He's not eating it. Well, what's wrong?
I don't know. He definitely looks hungry, though. Yeah.
Well, here. Try a Good Burger.
Would you look at that?
See, I told you there was something wrong with Mondo Burger.
[Ed] He knows it, don't you, boy?
He definitely senses something that he doesn't like.
What do you think it could be? I don't know.
Let's find out.
Where is that dang dog?
Excuse me, ladies, may I help you?
Could you kindly point us in the direction of the little girls' room?
Yes, ma'am. The ladies room is just on the other side of the restaurant.
-I'll show you. -Oh, get your hands...
-Ma'am! -...off of me!
I'm mighty mad!
Ma'am, I'm just trying to help.
I don't need your... Oh!
Water! Water!
Water! Water! I need water!
Whoo! Water! Oh!
Water! Ooh!
Water! Oh! Water! Oh!
Okay, I'll be right back.
Water! Water, water, water!
-All right, let's go. -Hey, what about your water?
Hey, what's that stuff they're dropping in the burgers?
I don't know, but I bet that's what's making those burgers grow so big.
We should get some of that stuff for Good Burger.
No, man, stuff like that's gotta be illegal.
It is illegal.
Triampathol is way illegal.
But I tell you what. It sure makes burgers nice and "enormo."
Oh, yeah, that's all well and good, but what happens to all those nice, innocent people
but what happens to all those nice, innocent people when they eat your "enormo" burgers?
Uh-oh. Don't care, ladies.
Yeah, yeah, laugh it up. Uh-huh.
But when those people find out that you're putting illegal stuff in their meat,
you're gonna find yourself in jail.
That is why nobody outside this kitchen is going to find out.
What do you expect us to do, keep our mouths shut?
No. I'll keep your mouths shut.
Ed, run!
Okay, Hot Pants, now, I'm tired of playing games.
I want to know what's in your sauce.
Well, you can forget it. You're not going to get Ed's sauce.
I want to know what's in your sauce. Dude, you need a Tic Tac. Ha-ha!
That coils it. You guys are grass.
What are we going to do with them?
Get our pal Wade on the phone.
Demented Hills?
Hey, all right, yeah, hey, easy, man, easy.
Yeah, all right, uh-huh, see, you'd like to...
You'll never be half the man your mama was.
[Dexter] Hey, man, you better let me go!
Hey, man, open the door! I'm not going to tell you again!
All right, maybe I'll tell you one more time. Open this door, please? Oh...
Look, Dex, the walls are padded! Look what I can do!
I don't get it. I just don't get it.
Where could they be? I'm really worried, you guys.
-♪ Hey! I'm a dude... ♪ -Hi.
Uh, huh... hi. I'm a psychopath. I'm Ed.
Have small space aliens ever landed in your brain

Not that I recall. Do you think I'm cute?
Sure. Huh.
What's cute about me?
Um... your head.
You have a cute head, too.
Well, I try to keep it nice. So, what you in for?
I got in trouble for breaking into the zoo and freeing all the kangaroos.
My name is Heather. Really? My mom's name is Heather.
Really?

Man...!
I got to play cards with these folk? Would you quit it?
You're nasty!

Stop waving that dang light in my face.
-Who are you? -Your mama. Who are you?
Relax, it's the old guy that works here.
What are you doing here this late? Sleeping, till you woke my butt up.
What's that junk you're pouring into our sauce? Shut up, old man.
Don't be rude to the elderly. The old man asked us a question.
Now, it's called shark poison,
and it's going to make all your little Good Burger customers very, very sick.
So sick that I doubt anybody will ever want to eat here again.
I'm calling the cops.
You're not calling anyone.
-[door opens] -[man] In you go.
Join your buddies.
Otis, you came to visit, huh?
Oh, I'm fine, and you?
Help me get him out of this!
Do I look like I came to visit?
Where am I? What's going on? They kidnapped us.
Why'd they bring you here?
'Cause I caught those little Mondo brats dumping shark poison in our sauce.
Shark poison?
Wow, why do they want to harm those innocent sharks?
Will you forget about the sharks? That stuff's gonna harm innocent people.
Can you get to a phone? There's no chance.
We gotta get out of this place. What time is it?
I'll tell you. It's six a.m. Good Burger opens at ten.
It's six a.m. Good Burger opens at ten.
That means we only got four hours to warn them.
But how are we going to get out of here? You just let me handle that part.
Good morning, patients. It's medication time.
I'll be back in ten minutes with your various prescriptions.
Ooh, that music sucks. Yeah, it does.
Well, hang on. Huh.
Hey, dude, I'll be right back.
Where you going?
Hey, I don't think you should be touching the knob on the...

On the black-hand side-- Huh, yeah! Hey, cool!
Leave it to you to make friends with a vicious psychopath.
[man over P.A.] Attention! Seal all exit doors.
There is an escape attempt in progress. Seal all exit doors.
Can we open any of these windows?
You can't. They're hermetically sealed, made of triple-thick, bulletproof glass.
Mister Huge Scary Man, can you help me open one of these windows?
-Cool. Go ahead, man, do your thing. -[growling]
Hey, man, what you think you doing? Oh, mercy, now...
Try to open the window! Oh, man!

They're coming. You two better hurry.
You don't got to tell me twice.
Whoa. Ed... hurry!
All right, but before I go, I just want to tell you,
you're the nicest, prettiest psychopath I've ever met.
Oh, you're so sweet.

-Stealing your truck. -Yeah, we'll bring it back.
Come on!

Will you turn that off?
Ice Cream Man!
Oh, sorry. No ice cream for you today.
[Dexter] Gotta go. Gotta get back to Good Burger. Oh, oh...
Good Burger's about to open, man. We gotta get there and make sure nobody eats that poison sauce.
We gotta get there and make sure nobody eats that poison sauce.
[Dexter] Man, they're gaining on us!
[Ed] Whoa, ice cream cones! Look!
I got funky pops, monster-cicles, and lemon juice pops! Huh!
Ed, this is no time for frozen treats, all right?
Yeah, but...
Wait. Wait. Give me one.
-Oh, here you go. -Thanks.
What was that? I think it's a fudgesicle.
Give me some more.
[Ed] Get out of here!
Have some vanilla!
Take that! Huh! And a little bit of that! Huh!
Have some raspberry sorbet!
[Ed] How do you like me now? I'm a dude throwing ice cream!
French vanilla! Yeah!
Take some chocolate! Yeah! Fudge!

Yeah, they're going to have you on This Old Homey.

[Wheat screams] No! No!
Watch it, fellas! Stop! Whew!

Oh, no! Come on!
Whoo! Lost 'em.
Hi. Welcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger.
Can I take your order?
I'll have a Good Burger... with extra sauce.
Oh! That sounds delightful. I'll have the same thing.
Better step on it.
Here's your order: two Good Burgers, extra sauce.
Thank you.
Oh, poo. I wanted mustard.
Ed, hurry! Don't let anyone eat a Good Burger.

No!
Get him off me!
What's going on? What the...?
Ed! Ed! Ed! What are you doing?
Ed, get off!
Ed, off the elderly.
Ed, Ed, are you okay?
-What happened? -I just tackled some old lady.
-All right, Ed! Way to go. -Cool.
Excuse me, would one of you two mind telling me why this is a good thing?
This is why. Mondo Burger poisoned our sauce.
How could Mondo Burger poison our sauce? We'll explain it to you later.
Right now, just keep everyone from eating that sauce, and call the cops.
-Come on, Ed. -Where are we going?
To get a can of Triampathol. -What for? -Proof.
[Ed] Okay.
I need a hot Jacuzzi.
-Shall I ring? -No!
Man, you can't just walk up there and ring the bell and say "Howdy do, neighbor."
We got to find a way to sneak into the kitchen somehow.
I got an idea. Huh. Follow me.
Where are you going?
[Dexter] Oh, dear, careful. Maybe you should... I don't know if...
Whoo! Shouldn't you have a harness or some rope?
Come on, it's easy! Yeah, easy for you!
Dang!
Climb on a truck?
I don't even know the person that owns this truck.
-And I got to do my thing... -Yeah. Phew.
[Ed] All right, now jump on that pipe thingy.
[grunting and gasping] See?
All right, you got it.
Got what? I'm swinging from a dang pipe.
Mama?
-Ed! -Over here! Over here. Come on!
What are you doing in the straw?
It's right over the kitchen. I can see it! Come on!
How do expect me to get up there? Oh, it's easy.
You just jump on the burger, jump on the fry,
and then you hop on the cup, and then shimmy up the straw.
What is this, American Gladiators? Come on!
All right.
Can't believe this man got me... climbing on a straw!
Ooh! Wow, Good Burger looks so small from up here.
Ed, Ed, are you in there?
Here, take my hand.
-Again! Again! That was cool! -Shh! Listen, listen.
I'm gonna go into that kitchen.
I want you to count to ten, come in there, get a can of that chemical
I want you to count to ten, come in there, get a can of that chemical and hightail it back to Good Burger, all right?
One...
two... three...
Hey, everybody! -What's happening? -How'd you get here?
-What's happening? -How'd you get here? Ooh! Look at this fancy kitchen.
You know, Mama never had one of these with the electronic numbers. -We had to turn the knobs... -Let's get him!
-We had to turn the knobs... -Let's get him!
...wait for the little ding...
If I were you... I wouldn't come any closer.
Get him.
Get him!
Come on, guys.
Let's go! Let's go!
Go! Around the other way!
All right, punk. The game is over.
Yeah. Your game is over,
because right now, my man Ed is on his way down to the police station
with a can of your illegal Triampathol.
Ha! Hey, Dex, got it! Huh.
-Get it! -Give me that.
Nice try, dudes, but you mess with Kurt and you go in the grinder.
-[Holmes] Here you go, boss. -Thanks, Holmes.
This can's empty.
-[all snickering] -What an idiot. Stole an empty can.
Ed, you stole a empty can?
It wasn't empty when I found it. Huh.
-What's going on? -I don't know.
-The kitchen! Go! -Come on!
[man] Come on.
Come on, Ed, let's go!
Grill! We got to stop the grill! -[man] Oh... -[grunting]
Let's get out of here!
Must be a shift change.
Why?
What have I done?
[Kurt] What, are you going to put cuffs on me, huh?
-Wha...? -Relax, sir, it's going to be okay.
-Wha...? -Relax, sir, it's going to be okay. You tell me if these are too tight, all right?
[Kurt] You don't understand! None of this is my fault, okay?
-I mean... -I don't know. -Hey, let's go help him out. Huh. -Let's.
[Kurt] Listen, I can explain everything.
-This is all just a big misunderstanding. -[siren wails]
I don't understand. I don't know what happened.
Oh, sure you do.
Why don't you go on ahead and tell your little police friend
that you made your big Beefy Burgers all big and beefy by using illegal food additives.
-Is that true? -No! He's lying! You're lying!
-Is that true? -No! He's lying! You're lying! You're full of crap!
Yeah? Well, why don't we just check these out, and we'll see who's lying.
-I think you better come with us. -You're out of your minds.
-I think you better come with us. -You're out of your minds. You're crazy, man!
-You know who I am? Huh? -Yeah, I know, I know.
-Bye-bye. -Hey, hey, remember:
when you mess with Good Burger... [both] you go in the grinder! -[Ed laughing] -[Dexter] Oh, dog,
-[Ed laughing] -[Dexter] Oh, dog, you enjoy prison now.
-Excuse me for a second. -Huh.
-Mr. Wheat, I can't, I can't... -I can fix it. I can fix it.
-...have a couple words for... -I can fix it. Uh, Mr. Wheat?
I don't have a lot of time, but I just got a couple words for you.
-[grunting] -Look here.
Here's about half of the money that I owe you for your car.
I guess I'll have the other half by the end of the summer.
You enjoy your car! Bye-bye, now.
You enjoy your car! Bye-bye, now. I'll give you some money. Help me out!
Man, just help me get the burger off.
-Ooh-hoo, come on, Ed. -Huh.
So, you poured that stuff in that meat, didn't you?
Huh, I had to. You had to?
Sure. See, I knew if I took the can,
there was a good chance I'd get caught. Huh.
Then I thought, even if I did take the Triampathol to the proper authorities,
huh, Kurt would hire some high-powered attorneys
who would dispute any charges brought against him or Mondo Burger,
by manipulating the legal system.
And the way that America's court system is congested these days,
it would have taken months to convict him of anything.
So then I thought, I'll take matters into my own hands
and just pour the Triampathol into the meat supply and let Mondo Burger be a victim of its own foul play.
and let Mondo Burger be a victim of its own foul play.
-Ha! Huh! -Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
-You thought of all that? -Yeah, sure.
I'm not stupid. Huh.
Huh. Well, look, Ed, about this contract, man,
what do you say we just... forget it?
Wait, you don't want to be partners?
Well, no.
-See... -Is it because I'm black?
No, it's not because you're... 'cause I'm... All right, look, forget it.
'cause I'm... All right, look, forget it.
All right, we can be partners, but the money is yours, all right?
All of it.
So, we're still buddies? -Oh, you know it. -[laughs]
Cool. Huh.
-Um, Dexter? -Huh? I just want to say that, well, I'm really going to miss you... a lot.
And, um... I will always remember you, Dexter Reed,
in my thoughts and in my heart.
[sobbing] Good-bye, my friend!
I'm not going anywhere, man.
That's right, baby, yeah!
Here come the heroes!
Let's hear it for the man who saved Good Burger, huh? Yeah!
-[all chanting] Ed, Ed, Ed, Ed... -What? What? What? What? What?
Come on, what? Come on.
-[Ed] Come on. -[chanting continues]
Aw... aw! -Speech, speech... -[man] Yeah, speech!
Yeah, come on, Ed, say something.
GUARD: He says you stole the bread. It's a lie. I caught him stealing ours.
It's a lie. I caught him stealing ours.
Cut off the infidel's hand.
No. I took the bread.
Wait. That's not true. They're not interested in the truth.
PETER: But he's lying. You're too weak, Peter. You would not live.
As you wish.
Cut the other one's hand off as well. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Robin.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Robin.
Oh, God.
No, no, no!
This is English courage.
Aah! Aah! That's for five years of hell.
Behind you!
Come on, Robin, for God's sake. Come on!
Wait! Take us with you!
You cannot save those people, Christian,
but you can save me. PETER: They're coming, Robin.
Christian!
Why should I? For pity's sake.
Mine is a sentence of death. No, Robin, he's a Moor. Don't listen.
Set me free. I will show you a way out.
Why should we? If you do not, we are all dead men.
No, Robin. For God's sake. Robin, they're coming!
I'm sorry. Come, Christian. Come.
This way.
Thanks. I misjudged you.
You are fast with a sword, my friend.
Five years I've waited for the smell of free air. It makes a man fast.
Aah! Peter!
It's mortal.
Leave me.
Give this ring to my sister, Marian,
and swear you'll protect her for me.
His wound is by the heart. We cannot save him.
Swear it, Robin.
I swear it. [GUARDS SHOUTING IN ARABIC] They're coming.
[GUARDS SHOUTING IN ARABIC] They're coming. PETER: Tell Marian I died a free Englishman.
Pe-- Peter! Peter!
For England!
Come, my friend. Make his sacrifice an act of honor.
Come now.
Why did you cut me free, Christian?
Whatever blood is in your veins, no man deserves to die in there.
Farewell, friend.
God speed your way.
Our way lies together with the speed of Allah.
What?
You have saved my life, Christian.
I will stay with you until I have saved yours. That is my vow.
Thanks, but I go to England. I relieve you of your obligation.
Only Allah can do that.
What if I say no?
You have no choice.
I am Azeem Edin Bashir al-Bakir.
You may call me Azeem.
Robin of Locksley.
LOCKSLEY "Kindest sir,
"'tis rumored you fought in King Richard's crusade
"with my beloved son Robin.
"I fear you have returned home "to desperate times,
"when dark forces plot against our absent king.
"I am anxious for word of my son.
"Were you present at his capture near Jerusalem?
"Do you know the name "of the potentate who holds him?
"Does he still bear me ill will?
"A little news, please, sir.
I would give all that I own for his release."
DUNCAN: Stop there! Help me, my lord!
You should have waited.
I'm sorry you were disturbed, master. Duncan, it's all right. Let him go.
MAN: They've taken my Gwen, my daughter.
Who's taken her? Men on horses, in masks.
Men on horses, in masks.
We tried to stop them, but...
my son, he's dead.
He's dead.
Master, stay. There is an evil moon tonight.
Never fear, Duncan. Good will overcome.
Trust in that.
I'm sorry, my lord. I had no choice.
You!
Locksley.
The king shall hear of this!
Join us.
Never.
Join us...
or die.
God and King Richard! Yaah!
Oh, thank you, Lord.
I'm home.
I'm home!
You are strange, Christian.
Yes, but I'm free.
Now I beg you to free yourself of your vow. Return with the boat.
I know how it feels to be so far from your home and family.
Because I love them so much, I cannot dishonor them.
I thought you'd say that.
No man controls my destiny,
especially not one who attacks downwind and stinks of garlic.
Come, Azeem.
Our fighting days are done.
By nightfall, we'll celebrate with my father.
You understand, of course...
I had to try.
I would have succeeded. [CHUCKLES]
ROBIN: Why must you walk in back of me?
AZEEM: In your country, am I not the infidel?
It seems safer to appear as your slave rather than your equal.
ROBIN: For an infidel, you have uncommon clarity of thinking,
but you tell me nothing of yourself. For instance, your name, Azeem--
what does it mean? It means "Great One."
"Great One," really? Did you give yourself this name?
It's-- It's a joke.
Azeem, the Great One, I am home! Whoo!
Look.
Mistletoe.
Many a maid's lost her resolve to me, thanks to this little plant.
In my country, we talk to our women.
We do not drug them with plants.
What do you know of women?
Where I come from, Christian,
there are women of such beauty that they can possess a man's mind so
that he would be willing to die for them.
Wait. Is that why you were to be executed?
Because of a woman?
Ha-ha-ha! That's it, isn't it?
That's it!
It is close to sunset.
You painted old dog. Who was she?
The mullah's daughter? Heh-heh-heh! Huh?
Another man's wife?
What's her name?
Is there no sun in this cursed country?
Which way is east?
Her name. East!
Her name.
Jasmina.
That way.
You are sure? I would know blindfolded.
I'm five miles from home.
Was she worth it?
Worth dying for.
You're dog's meat, son, you know that.
SOLDIER: Get down here! You know what you've done! Come down here! Down!
Come down here! Down! You're not playing by the rules, boy.
Deer don't climb trees.
Perhaps he thinks he's a game bird.
Shall we teach him to fly? SOLDIERS: Yeah.
Get him down.
ROBIN: Hold!
I'm curious as to what manner of creature is so fearsome that it takes six men to attack it.
Stranger, this is no affair of yours.
ROBIN: Well, have we treed the devil himself? Let me see.
Heh, heh. A small boy-- A truly dangerous animal.
This boy killed one of the Sheriff of Nottingham's deer.
You starve us! We needed the meat.
I advise you to move on, pilgrim. This is the sheriff's land.
Wrong.
This is my land and my tree. Therefore, whatever is in it also belongs to me.
Might I have the pleasure of your name before I have you run through?
Robin of Locksley.
Well, well. Locksley.
Welcome home.
Kill him! SOLDIER: Come on! Swords! Come on, hurry up!
SOLDIER: Come on! Swords! Come on, hurry up! Aah!
Azeem! It's time to redeem that vow!
Unleash the hounds!
Get off your damn knees!
Look out!
Now, sir,
if you'd be so kind as to give me your name before I run you through.
Guy of Gisborne, the Sheriff's cousin.
That little bastard was poaching deer. Poaching? Is it not a greater crime to starve a family?
Poaching? Is it not a greater crime to starve a family?
Go on, Locksley.
Go on.
I've seen enough blood spilt to last two lifetimes.
Now get off my land.
And tell Nottingham what happens to his scum when they pick on small children.
You.
You traveled 10,000 miles to save my life, then leave me to be butchered?
I fulfill my vows when I choose.
Which does not include prayer times or mealtimes or any time I'm outnumbered six to one.
or mealtimes or any time I'm outnumbered six to one.
You whine like a mule.
You are still alive.
ROBIN: Have no fear. Come down, boy.
Is it true, boy? Did you kill a deer?
Hundreds of them.
You scared him.
Interesting place, this...
England.
GUARD: Hold up, Sir Guy. The sheriff's not to be disturbed.
Cousin.
I trust you justify your intrusion with news of profound value.
I met a hooded man today who bade me warn you not to harm his people.
Who told you to cover up?
His name?
Robin of Locksley.
[CHUCKLES] The prodigal son returns.
He's a whelp. This girl could best him.
Put it there!
Yes, well, this whelp bested four of my men.
Yes, well, your men were probably drunk.
And yet you survived, cousin. I barely survived.
He has a companion-- A dark-skinned foreigner with the marked face of Islam,
A dark-skinned foreigner with the marked face of Islam, and he carries a Saracen sword.
Yes, yes. I'm sure it would take an army to match these rogues.
I trust Locksley's visited his manor and found the home fires still burning, heh.
ROBIN: Father?
Father! Is anyone here?
Duncan!
Father!
No!
No. Who is it? It's my father.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Master Robin?
Is that you?
Duncan?
Oh, praise be. I thought God had abandoned us.
Duncan, my father.
DUNCAN: Oh, it's a miracle. Why-- Why didn't you cut him down?
Why-- Why didn't you cut him down? DUNCAN: It's a miracle. I never thought that--
Are you deaf? Easy!
Look at him.
I would have done if I could see.
Who did this to you, Duncan?
Guy-- Guy of Gisborne,
with the sheriff and his witch looking on.
Why? They say that the sheriff captured your father worshiping the devil,
captured your father worshiping the devil,
that he signed a confession before the bishop.
No. That's not possible.
Nottingham declared all Locksley lands forfeit.
Did you believe the charges?
Not even when they took my eyes.
AZEEM: We must go.
He loved you till the end, young master.
He never gave up hope of your return.
I should have been here.
He called the crusades a foolish quest.
He said it was vanity to force other men to our religion.
But you must flee now.
Head south to safety. Gisborne will surely seek revenge.
I hear you, Duncan.
You should go home.
My world's turned upside-down here.
I cannot ask you to come where I'm going.
Alone, Christian, you will only get yourself killed.
Besides...
there is nothing left for me to go home to.
I will not rest until my father is avenged.
I swear it...
by my own blood.
Mortianna?
You cold, madam?
What do you see?
The son of a dead man. Locksley.
Does he affect us? He precedes the Lionheart.
King Richard returns from the Crusades. That could prove a bit awkward.
It would soften the spines of the barons. Soon? Make haste.
Soon? Make haste.
But my plan is still intact?
What's wrong?
I have seen our death.
The painted man-- He haunts my dreams,
adorned with strange foreign markings. Ah! Locksley's companion.
Ah! Locksley's companion.
Kill him! Kill them both!
What is this place?
Peter's home.
It's nearly six years since we left together.
We'll find food and shelter here.
No more beggars.
Tell the mistress of the house that Robin of Locksley is at her door.
Her Ladyship's not here.
Is the child Marian at home?
Maybe she is. Maybe she isn't. Aah! Oh!
The hospitality in this country is as warm as the weather.
It's a joke. Really?
Leave your weapons!
Just you.
Wait here.
Right here?
A curse on Moors and Saracens.
Were it not for their ungodly ways, Master Robin would never have left.
What manner of name is Azeem--
Irish, Cornish?
Moorish. [GASPS]
WOMAN: Who are you?
Robin of Locksley.
WOMAN: You lie. Robin is dead.
Step into the light.
Turn around.
Am I to dance next?
Who are you? I am the Maid Marian.
Well, then show yourself, child, for we knew each other well.
The years have...
...been kind. Thank you.
With the king away, we must guard against villainous outlaws
who would kidnap a relative of his. Surely you can see I'm not one of those.
Perhaps.
Now remove yourself from this house.
I would, my lady, but I'm sworn to protect you.
Protect me?
Robin of Locksley was nothing but a spoiled bully.
And besides, as you can see, we have enough protection.
Marian, wait.
You are truly courageous against an unarmed man.
Point me toward danger, Azeem. I'm ready.
Hello, Marian.
His last thoughts were of you.
Oh, Peter.
I'm sorry, Marian.
I'm sorry.
How do I know you didn't abandon him to save your own skin?
No one feels his loss more than I.
The next time I visit London, I'll convey your condolences to my mother.
I would think, for your safety, that you would join her there.
No. I have no interest in life at court.
All that gossip mongering and currying favor.
But you're alone here.
Hardly. These years have left us many in need.
While you and my brother were off playing boy heroes, Nottingham has plundered the shire.
I see you still have your lands.
Because I give them no excuse to take them.
I am the king's cousin. It is my station to look after these people until his return.
Marian.
Marian. Marian.
My purpose in coming was not to hurt you.
I swore... I swore to your brother that I would protect you.
You cannot replace my brother.
I don't want to replace him. Marian, I've returned to my home to find it destroyed
Marian, I've returned to my home to find it destroyed and my father murdered.
And the only explanations for it are the ramblings of an old blind man.
All I remember of you is a spoiled bully who used to burn my hair as a child.
is a spoiled bully who used to burn my hair as a child.
Please allow that years of war and prison may change a man.
Robin, whatever happened between you and your father, you mustn't believe
what they accused him of.
I don't.
AZEEM: Christian!
Look. Look.
How did your uneducated kind ever take Jerusalem?
God knows.
What is it?
What is it? It's Nottingham's soldiers.
Coming here? Is this your protection?
I killed some of the sheriff's men. Oh, dear.
I fear I've placed you in danger. Hmm.
I can take care of myself. Just go.
No. That's my horse.
A truly magnificent animal, my lady.
SOLDIER: Aah! Come on!
Go! I said I'm sworn to protect you.
And I say no more boyish gestures.
I'm not leaving.
Stop them! They're stealing my horses!
You're so kind, Marian.
You've been sheltering outlaws, Lady Marian?
They're thieves, you imbecile. Lucky he didn't steal your virtue as well.
A crown to the man who brings me Locksley's head! My lady. Hyah!
Have we lost them?
AZEEM: No.
My horse carries two. Yours is lame. We cannot outrun them.
Leave me, Master Robin. I slow your escape.
We can lose them in the forest. Sherwood Forest is haunted, Master.
Either we take our chances with the ghosts or becomes ghosts ourselves. Hyah!
Come on, damn you!
There are only three of them!
It's not the men we fear, sir. It's the evil spirits.
Robin of the hood,
son of a devil worshiper!
Your father died a coward,
cursing your name and squealing like a stuck pig!
You will bring no justice to your father by dying today.
DUNCAN: Master Robin?
There are your ghosts, Duncan--
wind chimes.
A child's toy put to good use.
You scare easily, my painted Moor.
This forest has eyes.
I swear it.
In my dreams alone have I imagined such a place.
Then imagine a way to cross it.
There's hope!
MAN: ♪ There was a rich man From Nottingham ♪ ♪ Who tried To cross the river ♪
♪ What a dope He tripped on a rope ♪
♪ Now look at him shiver ♪
Beg for mercy, rich man!
I beg of no man.
Well, this here is our river, and any man who wishes to cross must pay a tax.
I will pay no tax.
As you can see, I have nothing,
not even my sword. Bollocks!
Any man who travels with two servants
and claims he's got no bloody money
is either a fool or a liar. Yeah, he's a liar! Who are you?
Yeah, he's a liar! Who are you? John Little...
...best man of the woods. Yeah! Yay! That's right.
Yeah! Yay! That's right.
Well, best man, do you lead this rabble? MAN 1: Whoa! MAN 2: Oh!
Yes, I do, mate.
And if you tosspots want to travel through Sherwood Forest, it's going to cost you...
that gold medallion.
This is sacred to me.
It's sacred to us too, matey.
That there will feed us for a blooming month.
You'll have to fight me for it. MAN 1: Whoa! MAN 2: Whoa!
Love to, mate.
Be careful, Father.
He walloped 12 of the sheriff's men.
Is that so?
Reckon I'm going to enjoy this.
That's your father?
WILL SCARLETT: He's drowning!
LITTLE JOHN: Lost something?
Thanks for the taxes. Ha-ha-ha!
Looks like the little rich boy is lost for words, eh?
Any great ideas? Get up! Move faster!
Move faster. Great idea.
MAN: Watch it, John!
We're not through yet. All right, my old cocker.
You want another good walloping?
You shall have one.
Seems I've made it past the gate, John Little.
Or should I call you Little John? WULF: Hit him, Father! Wallop him!
Swimming time again, old chum. Oh!
WULF: Where is he? Do you see him?
It's a bloomin' shame.
He was a brave lad.
Help!
Do you yield? I can't bloody swim!
Do you yield? Yes!
Good. Now put your feet down.
I'll be buggered.
The medallion. Give me your name first.
Robin of Locksley.
Well, Robin of Locksley...
you got balls of solid rock. Come on.
That's Much the miller's son, Harold Brownwell,
and that stumpy one there is David of Doncaster, but the lads all calls him Bull.
'Cause you're short? No. It's 'cause I'm so long! Ha, ha!
No. It's 'cause I'm so long! Ha, ha!
Yeah, have a look. No, Bull. Save it. Save it for the ladies.
Give the man some mead.
Now, I made that myself.
Has English hospitality changed so much in six years
that a friend of mine's not welcome at this table?
But he's a savage, sire.
That he is.
But no more than you or I.
And don't call me sire.
With regret, I must decline.
Allah forbids it. Your bloody loss, mate.
How is it there are so many of you in hiding?
Well, we're all outlaws. Got prices on our heads.
Even the young lad there.
He's a blasted sheriff. He says we owes him taxes.
Well, you know, your ghosts will only keep the sheriff's men at bay so long.
They've worked so far. You have a better idea?
You can always fight back. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha-ha.
I reckon I must have cracked that noble head of yours.
These are all good lads here.
They got hearts of oak, but they're farmers.
It'd be lambs to the slaughter.
They say the sheriff was raised by a witch. Witch?
Witch? WULF: She knows every man's thoughts.
You can see right through her, and she flies. That's a load of codswallop, Wulf.
What does the rich son of a devil worshiper care about outlaw peasants?
My lord was a kind and generous man!
Who among you dares believe him capable-- Easy.
My father was no devil worshiper,
and I'll have words with any man who says otherwise.
But he's right.
I was a rich man's son.
But when I killed the sheriff's men,
I became an outlaw like you. You are nothing like us.
LITTLE JOHN: Well... That there's Will Scarlett. Don't take no note of him.
Don't take no note of him. He's full of piss and wind.
Come on, lads, drink up.
Stop talking so much bloody rubbish.
This here is the best we simple men can expect.
Here we're safe.
Here... we are kings. Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!
Too much mead, old friend? Oh, forgive me. I oversleep. No, no. Rest yourself.
No, no. Rest yourself.
What day is it, Duncan? Sunday, I think.
Do they still give alms to the poor at mass?
That they do.
These days, the need for mercy is greater than ever.
We beseech thy blessing, Lord,
on all your people... but most especially
on our noble sheriff of Nottingham.
Grant him the wisdom to guide and protect our glorious city.
to guide and protect our glorious city.
Grant him also the strength
to bring to justice the lawless men who would threaten its safety
the lawless men who would threaten its safety and prosperity
and the judgment to punish them
in your name. Amen.
BISHOP: Go in peace.
Sarah. Yes.
Ma'am. That's all I have. God bless you, mum.
Alms for a blind man, milady? Mmm.
For one who cannot see your beauty.
Hello. What are you doing here?
Searching my soul.
I do not wish to be seen with an outlaw.
You prefer the company of Nottingham?
There's a price on your head.
How much? One hundred gold pieces.
Is that all?
I'll have to annoy the good sheriff more. Soon it will be 1,000.
For 1,000, I would turn you in myself.
Nottingham is mounting an army.
He has every blacksmith in the county holed up in the castle, making swords and armor.
What is he planning? I don't know, but there's no limit to the man's ambitions.
I don't know, but there's no limit to the man's ambitions.
Go! Thank you. Quickly! Go!
Robin, do something for me.
What? Take a bath.
Take a bath?
These are my private chambers, my son.
I have priests who would hear your confession. Gggt! Aah!
I see the boy I knew in the man before me.
Welcome home, Robin.
You shine like the sun, my lady.
You've been meeting with Robin of Locksley.
My cousin tells me the knave deprived you of some horses.
Oh...yes. A most disagreeable experience. Yes, I know. And for inflicting that upon you,
Yes, I know. And for inflicting that upon you,
I'm going to hang him from the walls by his own entrails.
I'd like to see that, my lord.
If you'd bring your household within the city walls,
I could give your every need my personal attention.
I do thank you, but I prefer to stay in my family's home for now.
Oh. Well, then, perhaps you'd do me the honor
of accepting a small token of my undying devotion to your safety.
Why...King Richard will be deeply moved to hear of your concern for my welfare.
I'm afraid the king has many enemies both abroad and at home. I fear for his safe return.
both abroad and at home. I fear for his safe return.
Oh, no. Fear not, dear sheriff. He will return, and when he does,
He will return, and when he does, he will wish to reward his faithful subjects.
I asked your father three times if he worshiped the dark one
because his answer vexed me so grievously.
He said...
he must meet God with a clear conscience.
You lie.
On your souls, do not shed blood in the house of God!
NOTTINGHAM: You bastard! MAN: In there!
Get him!
NOTTINGHAM: Locksley!
I'm going to cut your heart out with a spoon!
Then it begins.
WOMAN: He's taking the sheriff's horse!
Close the gate!
MAN: The sheriff's horse! Close the gate! He's stolen the sheriff's horse!
What are you looking at?
Water!
Thank you. For the animal.
How can I protect you, Christian, if I know not where you go?
You've hardly raised a finger when you do know...
Great One.
I prefer to have the choice.
Wonderful. You've stolen the sheriff's horse?
You've stirred up a bloody hornet's nest now!
Are you afraid, John? Yeah, a little.
Well, so is the sheriff. Today I gave him a sting he'll not forget. You fool! You've started a war!
You fool! You've started a war! We're already at war.
Duncan... Bread.
And I say we strike back at the very man who takes our homes
and would hunt our children. We?
You planning to join us then, matey?
No, to lead you.
Christian...
these are simple people.
They are not warriors.
Be careful you do not do this for your own purposes.
You forget yourself, Azeem. I do not ask for your company or counsel.
Why a spoon, cousin? Why not an ax or something--
NOTTINGHAM: Because it's dull, you twit! It'll hurt more!
I want this brigand found.
Starve them out! Slaughter their--
Starve them out! Slaughter their-- No, take their livestock.
I want Locksley's own people fighting to bring his head in.
Well, perhaps we could create a name for him,
something to drive fear into the hearts of the populace. Maybe Locksley the Lethal or Wreaking Robin or--
Maybe Locksley the Lethal or Wreaking Robin or-- Whatever! I want him dead by the next full moon,
Whatever! I want him dead by the next full moon, before the barons come back.
Now sew...
And keep the stitches small!
He's not here, sir.
Where is your mate, the man they call Little?
He died last winter. Burn it down.
Leave us the sow. Her young will feed us.
Beware of the Sherwood Bandit. Robin of the Hood? Yes, sir.
Pray he's brought to us before winter.
Ma! Over here!
MAN: Alfred! What's happened to you?
Oh, John! Hey, Fanny! Papa!
They burned it, all of it. All right, what happened?
Where is this Robin Hood now?
He's there.
Look! Look what they've done!
If it's fame you seek, Christian,
I think you have it.
You brought this misery on us, Locksley.
ROBIN: It's Nottingham trying to divide us. We are divided, rich boy.
I'm not as blind as that old man.
You're still trying to be lord of the manor.
I heard today the sheriff now values your neck at 500 gold pieces.
I say we take him in.
Will, do you think the sheriff will give everything back after I'm gone?
He'll give us the reward and our pardons. ROBIN: Wrong.
He'll stretch your necks, one by one.
What would you have us do,
fight armored men on horseback with-- With rocks and our bare hands?
If needs be.
But with the one true weapon that escapes you, Will...
Courage.
Look out!
Thank you, Wulf.
You wish to end this? [MEN MUMBLE IN AGREEMENT]
You wish to go home? [MEN CHATTER IN AGREEMENT]
Then we must stop fighting amongst ourselves
and face that the price for it may be dear.
I for one would rather die than to spend my life in hiding.
The sheriff calls us outlaws,
but I say we are free.
And one free man defending his home
is more powerful than 10 hired soldiers.
The Crusades taught me that.
I will make you no promises, save one...
That if you truly believe in your hearts that you are free...
...then I say we can win.
They got armor. MAN 1: Yeah! MAN 2: Right!
They got armor, Bull?
Even this boy can be taught to find chinks in every suit of armor.
We ain't got nothing to eat.
What do we need that the forest cannot provide? We have food, wood for weapons.
We have food, wood for weapons.
We'll find safety and solace in her trees.
Yeah, but what about our kin?
Sheriff's taken all they got too.
Then, by God, we take it back.
What's the meaning of this?
Milady, a woman of your beauty has no need for such decorations.
How dare you!
Please don't take that. Please don't take that.
Please, sir, those belong to our Lord. Now they belong to my lord sheriff!
Give it back.
Good. Tell the sheriff
for every harm he does these people, I will visit it back on him tenfold.
Something vexes thee?
What the devil? 'Tis a hot day, my friend,
to burden your horse with such a heavy purse.
The sheriff will hear of this.
I truly hope so. WULF: Yeah!
There you go, love. Buy yourself a new sow.
God bless you, Fanny,
and God bless Robin Hood.
SCRIBE: We reckon he's nicked 3 to 4 million in the last five months, sire.
All right, then fine. Raise the bounty on his head.
Twenty-five thousand crowns.
Begging your pardon, sire. It won't do no good how much you raise it.
Really, scribe? And why is that? Because, sire, the poor, you see?
Because, sire, the poor, you see? He gives them what he takes,
and, well, sire, they love him.
Just a minute.
Robin Hood steals money from my pocket,
forcing me to hurt the public, and they love him for it?
and they love him for it?
Yes.
[CUP CLATTERS] That's it, then!
Cancel the kitchen scraps for lepers and orphans,
no more merciful beheadings,
and call off Christmas.
The treasury is empty.
All day and all night, people plague my door,
whining for tax relief and safe passage through Sherwood Forest.
"We cannot pay thee what the highwayman has taken."
It's the shortest route to London, sire.
It's the only road to London, you little ferret.
Sir Guy's patrols have found nothing, sire.
No camp. Nothing.
This hooded viper simply slithers into the forest.
You, my room, 10:30 tonight. You, 10:45...
and bring a friend.
FRIAR: ♪ What's the pleasure In this life ♪ ♪ Laughter, love And drinking ♪

Friar! I assure you, you'll find it difficult to sing
Friar! I assure you, you'll find it difficult to sing with a sword in your gullet.
Yes, my lord. [LAUGHS] You pig.
MAN: Shut up about it! Help me move this log! Log? This is a tree!
You're supposed to help me! I'm supposed to be meeting a girl!
I'm supposed to be meeting a girl!
You men in front, after me. You men in the rear, stay with the wagon!
On to glory!
Bastards! Come on, find them!
Go! Hyah!
Welcome to Sherwood, friar. Giddyup!
I'll be buggered.
This treasure had a purpose. We must find out what.
ROBIN: Good morning, my reverend friend.
You travel with poor company when you travel with Nottingham soldiers.
MERRY MEN: Tax him! Tax him! Tax him!
I'm Robin of Locksley, and my men are thirsty.
MAN 1: Aye! MAN 2: That's right. Robin Hood! Ha! Lord bless me.
Ha! Lord bless me.
I mistook you for common thieves.
Kindly let me pass, huh?
Surely the Lord has the charity to spare a few barrels for good Christian men, yes?
We have much to celebrate. MAN 3: Come on.
If you wish them to share in the good Lord's brew...
[GRUNTS] ...you must best me for it!
Confess, Robin Hood, that Friar Tuck is a braver, holier, and wiser man
that Friar Tuck is a braver, holier, and wiser man than thou art. Ha, ha-- [GRUNTS]
He giveth, and he taketh away. Ah...
Do you yield?
I'd rather roast in hell. Aah!
Shoot him! Shoot him!
Oh, I think the good friar's taken us far enough.
MAN 1: Well done, friar.
Thank you, Lord, for teaching me humility. Oh...
Well, Tuck... MAN 2: Thanks for the beer.
Are these not the meek of the earth?
We're in need of an honest man to minister to them.
What say you, friar?
The Lord reveals himself in mysterious ways.
I accept. Good.
You will not regret it.
Aye, but you may!
We were ambushed, cousin.
Spanish steel. Much stronger than our native blades.
Ahem. Any losses?
Some.
In truth, all of them.
And the gold? Taken.
Robin Hood?
They were woodsmen, cousin.
Robin Hood.
I tried.
I tried. Cousin. I tried. I tried.
I tried. I tried. Cousin, we must be strong.
Cousin, we must be strong.
We can't allow an outlaw to make fools of us.
And I can't allow a lieutenant
to fail me.
Well, at least I didn't use a spoon.
It's good steel.
Take the left one. Which one's left?
Which one you taking? What do you mean?
If you're taking the left, I'm taking the right. Which one's on the right?
Which one's on the right? The one next to...
Bollocks, we'll just jump out and grab them. Ah.
Now? Now!
A donation, if you please.
Donation? For what?
Bull? [WHISPERS]
Uh, for passage through Sherwood. Very well.
Come and get it. Huh?
You stunted shrub. How dare you attack us?
It's me job, milady. Your job? And who is your employer?
Your job? And who is your employer? Robin Hood.
I insist on seeing him at once.
BULL: No! MUCH: I'm trying to stop her!
BULL: No! You cannot go down there! Will you stop? Don't rush. You'll fall, milady.
He's not expecting you! My lady's intrusion is simply tit for tat.
Out of the way, you old traps!
You can't go down there! [GASPS] Oh.
Ooh! Oh, I say! Cover your eyes.
Milady, don't.
You could have said.
BULL: Robin! You got visitors!
[SIGHS] Don't look at me like that. It weren't my fault. SARAH: Madam, you be careful.
It was Much! It weren't me! Be careful. It's slippery there.
Hello.
Well, what are you doing here?
Taking a lady's advice. Oh.
ROBIN: What happened to your eye, Bull?
It was set upon by 10-- Twelve!
Fifteen large, big lads. Oh, yeah? Yeah.
You've been busy.
Ha-ha-ha! We have guests! MAN: Bring them down!
It works.
Kind of.
Of course it works.
Great shot! A beauty!
All right, Wulf, take your time, now.
That's good, Wulf, but can you do it amidst distraction?
Can you make the shot when you must?
MAN: Show him, Wulf. Go on. You can do it.
Can you?
Well, go on, Robin. It was a dirty trick.
Oh, he's serious. Is his shirt coming off at all? Ha-ha-ha!
Well done. Well done.
[CHUCKLES] TUCK: This is grain... which any fool can eat,
but for which the Lord intended a more divine means of consumption.
Let us give praise to our maker and glory to his bounty
by learning about...
beer.
Did you bring me here to brag?
This is blood money, Marian.
It's intended to bribe King Richard's enemies to unite against him.
We intercepted it.
But who would... Nottingham.
No. Nottingham would not dare challenge the king. The king is not in England to be challenged, is he?
While he's away, he may lose his country.
You thought...
You thought I was keeping it all, didn't you?
Didn't you?
Well, here--
A contribution to your cause. Keep it.
Keep it. No. This dagger would fetch a great price.
Keep it. No! It's not dear to me--
I mean, it... It's not.
Oh, I'm saying everything wrong.
Cheers.
How do I get down?
Wait, wait. MARIAN: Oh.
We don't go that way anymore. I'm happy to hear that.
I'm happy to hear that.
Grab on. Mm-hmm.
We have a rule here.
Once someone has seen the way to our camp, that person cannot leave.
There's too many lives at stake.
That's why Sarah and I asked to be blindfolded. Oh.
Well, perhaps you might join us for dinner.
Perhaps.
Salaam, little one.
Did God paint you? Did God paint me?
For certain. Why?
Because...
Allah loves wondrous variety.
How is it that a once arrogant young nobleman...
has found contentment living rough with the salt of the earth?
I've seen knights in armor panic at the first hint of battle,
and I've seen the lowliest, unarmed squire pull a spear from his own body
to defend a dying horse.
Nobility's not a birthright.
It's defined by one's actions.
It's interesting to hear you say that.
I didn't.
My father did.
Did the holy quest erase your hatred of him?
I don't know.
All I know is that our last words in this world were... spoken in anger.
I was lost after my mother died.
My father too. And for a short time, he found comfort
in the arms of another woman, a peasant woman.
I thought he was betraying my mother's memory.
So he gave her up?
For the love of a 12-year-old boy who would never forgive him.
Anyway, who...
Who says I'm content? I have my plans for the future. [LAUGHS]
I have my plans for the future. [LAUGHS]
No, a grander scheme than this? No. A simpler one.
A home, family...
love.
Oh, men speak conveniently of love when it serves their purpose.
And when it doesn't, 'tis a burden to them.
Robin of the Hood, Prince of Thieves...
...is he capable of love?
WULF: Father!
Father!
It's mother. She's dying. Oh, God!
Fanny...
your baby has not turned.
It cannot be born without help. FANNY: Uhh...
TUCK: He is the devil's seed, sent to lead us astray. Don't listen to him. He will kill her!
If you do not listen to me,
she will certainly die...and the child. FANNY: No! Aah!
The good friar's done all he can.
I suggest you let the Moor try.
So be it. Then be it on your head. I've warned you.
Marian. MARIAN: Yes? Get me needle, thread, water.
And hurry. Yes.
Come with me. Come, John. Oh...
What are you going to do?
I have seen it many times...
with horses.
With horses?
Bite down, bite down. Yes.
Help me, Sadiq.
MARIAN: Give me your arms.
It will be all right.
I tell you, John, the barbarian is killing her. FANNY: No!
No, Father, no! Out of the way, boy.
Quick, take him, take him.
Ooh, what is it? Oh, oh... [CRYING]
Your son, milady. There you are.
You truly are a great one.
My son!
Look at that lovely little baby. Isn't he wonderful? Yay! Yay!
Today the Lord has taught me a fine lesson.
And though I may think I am Godly, I know I am not worldly.
Please, please.
Come, my barbarian friend, so you and I open a barrel together and do our best to save each other's souls.
Alas, I am not permitted. Well, fine, then. You talk, I'll drink.
Milady! MARIAN: Sarah!
May I have this dance? Oh!
ROBIN: This lady is spoken for.
Why this way?
So you cannot find the way back or be forced to tell others the way.
It was good to see you again, Marian.
It was good to be seen.
I have two favors to ask of you.
One.
Take Duncan with you. I fear for his health with what may lie ahead.
Besides, I grow tired of his bellyaching.
DUNCAN: You wish me to leave, Master Robin?
Old friend, listen to me.
Can you take Lady Marian safely home?
I fear for her safety.
Of course, sire. Good.
Bull.
And two? Yes, two.
You're King Richard's cousin.
You can get word to him of Nottingham's plan.
He would believe you.
If the sheriff found out, I could lose all that I have.
That's true,
but will you do it for your king?
No.
I'll do it for you.
He fancies you, my lady.
I am blind, but some things I can still see.
NOTTINGHAM: In 10 days' time, the barons are coming.
Robin Hood has stolen what I was to pay for their allegiance,
and I am surrounded by fools who do not realize my obligations.
Tell me, Mortianna,
am I thwarted?
Recruit the beasts that share our God.
Animals? From the North.
From the North. You mean Celts.
They drink the blood of their dead. Yoke their strengths.
Yoke their strengths.
Hired thugs.
Ahh. Brilliant.
Put thine own issue on the throne.
A child? How?
Alive with royal blood.
Who?
It's a personal matter, my lord, but one of vital importance.
I understand, my dear lady.
This is my most trusted emissary.
He must travel to France immediately and put that directly into the hands of the king.
My lady-in-waiting shall accompany you.
My dear, I could not vouch for her safety.
The journey is fraught with danger.
Yes, I appreciate your concern, my lord,
but Sarah is an accomplished rider, and I insist that she go along.
As you wish.
What is wrong?
My horse is favoring his foreleg.
Duncan, is that you?
Hello?
Rebecca.
[CAT SCREECHES] Oh, God!
Nicodemus. Go.
Find mice. Ha, ha! [SCREAMS]
I've never seen the breasts of a noblewoman.
SOLDIER 2: Oh, pardon, milady, we couldn't hold him! Someone wants a word with you.
Oh, no! SOLDIER: That's it, sir. That's all of them.
Easy, easy.
Tonight I need your eyes, old friend.
MAN: Robin! Someone is in our home!
All is well. It's Duncan!
Okay. Duncan.
What happened? I found you, Robin. Thank God I did it.
I found you, Robin. Thank God I did it.
Nottingham's men attacked us. Marian?
They took her.
LITTLE JOHN: What is it?
Over there! Look!
On the hill!
MAN: Celts. God help us.
Allah, be merciful.
To the trees! To the trees!
Celts! They're coming!
Poor old fool led them straight to us.
Get me prisoners. Aah!
Children! With me! FANNY: Grab the children!
CHILD: Daddy! Save me!
My God.
Robin, save us!
Come! Hurry!
Save yourselves!
We better go, Robin! We go now!
Robin!
Come on. This way, my lambs! Come on!
Hold thy fire. Help!
It's gold! Gold! Look! It's gold!
[BABY CRYING] Fanny!
Fanny!
John! Come on, now!
Fanny!
FANNY: Go! Save yourself, John!
LITTLE JOHN: No, Fanny! I won't leave you!
FANNY: Go on, John!
LITTLE JOHN: Never!
FANNY: Oh, God!
Oh, thank God.
John, you'll have to catch her! Come on!
LITTLE JOHN: I got you, girl!
Quick! Quick! All right!
Come on! Come on!
LITTLE JOHN: Get over here! Go on!
Come on!
Don't wait for me! John, go on!
Hurry!
Corpus Christi.
Amen.
My Lady Marian.
By what right do you keep me prisoner?
You misunderstand my intentions.
You've been brought here for your own protection.
Protection from whom? From yourself.
It seems you've been consorting with outlaws.
Where do you hear such lies?
By your own hand, my lady.
I'm sorry, my child.
I feared you were being led astray.
Come.
It's over.
Today I return justice to this land.
I shall have to hang the ringleaders, of course, but I would like to be generous
and give you the lives of the woodsmen and their families--
The children!
And, of course,
of your traitorous lady-in-waiting... MAN: Get in there!
As a wedding gift.
And just who am I supposed to marry?
Search your heart, my child.
Why not a union with the house of Nottingham
and heal the wounds in our land?
There's only one man who can heal the wounds of this land-- Robin Hood.
who can heal the wounds of this land-- Robin Hood.
I'm truly sorry, my lady.
He wasted his life. How many more lives would you waste?
What a beautiful child.
So young...
So alive, so unaware of how precarious life can be.
I had a very sad childhood. I'll tell you about it sometime.
I never knew my parents. It's amazing I'm sane.
Marian...
Our bonding would allow these children to grow up as my allies.
You understand...
I cannot allow them to grow up as my enemies.
I have no choice.
That's true.
Look.
Christian.
Now, I have heard that Robin Hood may still be alive.
Either tell me where he may be hiding,
or you'll all be hanged, and we'll catch him anyway and do the same thing to him.
I'd love to kill him for you. Will, no!
So he is alive, then?
I'm not really sure.
Then why would I need you?
Because, my lord, if he is alive, I can get close to him. I'm one of his men.
I can get close to him. I'm one of his men. He would never suspect me.
He knows you hated him, traitor! Shut up! Shut up!
He's a trusting fool. He'll believe me. If he doesn't, he'll kill me.
Then you've lost nothing.
If you fail...
I will personally remove your lying tongue.
My pride brought us to this. AZEEM: No, Sadiq.
It was you who gave pride to these people.
I was a fool.
I was a fool to let him leave...
To believe I'd planned it all so perfectly.
I once heard a wise man say...
...there are no perfect men in this world...
...only perfect intentions.
You were an honor to your countrymen today, Azeem.
You fought better than 20 English knights.
Will!
I thought you were taken. I was.
How did you escape?
LITTLE JOHN: Traitor! I'll wring your scrawny neck for you, Will Scarlett!
I'll wring your scrawny neck for you, Will Scarlett!
You get in there! No bugger escapes the sheriff,
You get in there! No bugger escapes the sheriff, not unless he's lining his bloody pockets! Now, get in! [FANNY SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]
Now, get in! [FANNY SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] Where's my son? Wait! Wait, John!
Where's my son? Wait! Wait, John! Let him betray us?
I'll have your guts for garters, you little toad!
Bugger me. God.
Let him speak.
I bring a message...
...from Nottingham.
Our men are to be hung in the square at high noon tomorrow. What about my boy?
at high noon tomorrow. What about my boy? The boy too.
The boy too. Ten men in all.
The hangings are to be part of the celebration for the sheriff's marriage.
Marriage? To who?
Lady Marian.
If he takes a bride of royal blood... LITTLE JOHN: Aye...
and with King Richard gone, he'll be after the bloody throne.
he'll be after the bloody throne. You were to use this news to get close to me
You were to use this news to get close to me and then kill me, right, Will?
What are your intentions? That depends on you, Locksley.
I've never trusted you, that's no secret. What I wanna know is
are you gonna finish what you've started.
I wanna know if he's gonna turn and run like the spoiled little rich boy I always took him for?
Did I wrong you in another life, Will Scarlett?
What does this intolerable hatred for me come from?
From knowing that our--
Our father loved you more than me.
ROBIN: Our father?
We are brothers, Robin of Locksley.
I am the son of the woman who replaced your dead mother for a time!
It was your anger that drove them apart! It's a lie! It's not a lie!
It's a lie! It's not a lie! You ruined my life!
I have more reason to hate you than anyone,
but I found myself daring to believe in you.
What I want to know, brother,
is will you stay with us and finish what you've started?
I have a brother?
I have a brother.
I will make my stand with you,
side by side,
to the end.
To the end!
We're all bloody in.
Daft buggers.
We finish this.
Aah! What was that?
Truly you are a wizard!
The mystery is in the black powder.
Surely the Lord will grant us victory.
Bull. Yeah?
Position by the gate to cut off reinforcements.
John, sit on this wall to protect our escape. I will conceal myself here below the scaffold
I will conceal myself here below the scaffold
to cut our men from their nooses at the signal.
No. I'll do that. You cover us with your bow.
It's too dangerous, Will.
So is your aim. [BULL CHUCKLES]
Whatever Azeem is concocting, we must each be in place for it.
Our success depends on total concert. We may be only six men-- Seven.
We may be only six men-- Seven.
What are you doing, woman? Where's the little ones?
Safe with me mother.
You gone bleeding cracked? You'd get hurt.
I've given birth to eight babies. Don't you talk to me about getting hurt, you ox.
I'm not just gonna sit here and let one of them die.
You should be bloody well minding the other seven.
Tell her, Rob.
Fanny...
you will take position here.
No blades, no bows. You'll leave your weapons here.
No blades, no bows. Leave your weapons here.
No blades, no bows. No blades.
What have you got there, Father? Oh! The Lord's finest brew
Oh! The Lord's finest brew for the good sheriff's fighting men.
It has a mighty kick, huh?
No blades, no bows.
Don't anger him. He is a Celt. Shh!
John! John!
SOLDIER 1: Hey, you.
Do I know you? Please, sir, don't hurt me.
Oh, my God, you stink.
Pardon my blindness. I'm always falling-- Get out of here! [GRUNTS]
Thank you for noticing me, sir. Careful, friar.
What are you doing?
Ah, distributing libations for the celebration of the sheriff's nuptials.
Why, is there something amiss? You are. Get this stuff out of here.
Caesar has spoken, my leprous friend. We shall collect our offerings and depart.
Is this your finger? Leper? What? Go on, get this cart out of here.
Leaving bits and pieces of himself all over England. Ugh!
What are you doing here?
I ain't doing no harm, dearie. I likes a good hanging, I do, ha!
What's in this bundle? That's firewood. Psst. Hey!
Hello, my lover. MAN 1: Oyez, prepare for the outdoor hanging.
TUCK: Make way for the Lord's work. No fighting here.
Make way for the Lord's work.
A simple benediction for these poor bastards about to stretch.
God receive them in thy mercy
and show them the love that they do so richly deserve, even though they be thieving sons of bitches.
[GASPS LOUDLY] Hey! Nothing there but trouble, boy.
That's a little inappropriate, don't you think?
No more than your wedding present.
Bring them out! MAN 2: Oh, they're coming! [DRUMMING RHYTHMICALLY]
Get on. Get your heads up in there. MAN 3: Thief!
Patience!
SOLDIER 2: Make way.
Traitor! Traitor! Kill him! Aah! Stop, stop!
What's going on? Traitor!
Bring him here!
Kill him! Kill him! What did I do?
Oh, the turncoat.
Did you succeed?
Well, I-- I found his lair, but, uh...
he was already dead.
You sure? You saw Hood's body?
No... I saw a grave.
We found this on him.
String him up with the others.
Put me down! Let me go! Ugh!
Let me go!
Leave him, he's only a boy. Shut up!
Bastard. You all right?
Now, Robin?
My lord, it appears there's no more room.
I'm afraid I'll have to respectfully decline. Come on, you. Down.
Down!
[GRUNTING] Go on. Hold your tongue!
There's always room for one more. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
My boy! John! No!
LITTLE JOHN: I'm coming, Wulf! My boy!
Locksley. [SCREAMS] Robin!
Get some troops in here!
What are you waiting for? Get on with it!
Help!
[COUGHING] Wulf! Father. Oh!
Oh, thank God.
Come on, you milksops! Fight your way free!
Come on, you milksops! Fight your way free! WILL SCARLETT: Look out!
This way! To the wall!
My Lord Sheriff, is this your idea of control?
Shut up, you twit!
Come with me. MARIAN: Robin!
Marian.
Marian!
AZEEM: English!
English!
Behold, Azeem Edin Bashir al-Bakir!
I am not one of you,
but I fight!
I fight with Robin Hood!
I fight against a tyrant who holds you under his boot!
If you would be free men,
then you must fight! Join us now!
Join Robin Hood! Freedom! Come on, now! Come on!
Come on! Get back! Hyah!
MARIAN: Help, Robin!
John!
Close the gate. No!
Guard it with your life. Bring the bishop to my chapel.
Bring the bishop to my chapel. Push.
Right there.
Is she worth it?
Worth dying for?
Will!
Fuck me. He cleared it.
Marian!
We're doomed.
'Tis rebellion, my lord. We must escape. Marry us! No!
I will never marry you! [SPITS]
That's my wife, crone!
Get away! Ah, she's ripe.
Get away! Ah, she's ripe. She will give us a son.
You must take her now.
I will not take her until we are properly wed!
For once in my life, I will have something pure. Will you stop interfering?
'Tis madness to delay. No!
Aah! Marry them or face me.
Marian!
Aah! Marian!
Where is she?
The Lady Marian. Up the stairs. That way. MARIAN: Aah! Aah!
Marian? MARIAN: Aah!
ROBIN: Marian! [GASPS]
Robin! Get on with it! Robin!
Robin!
Statue. Statue.
Do you, George, Sheriff of Nottingham,
take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
To have and to hold
in sickness and in health, for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, till death--
Yes, yes. Come on! Make haste.
BISHOP: Do you, Marian, of the house of Dubois, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband-- No--!
Yes, of course she does. [CHUCKLES]
Marian!
Damned English oak. MARIAN: Robin! Marian!
MARIAN: Robin! Marian! MARIAN: Robin! I'll try another way.
MARIAN: Robin! I'll try another way.
What do you want?
I can't do this with all that racket!
How could you? How could you?
The painted man. The witch.
I didn't know. I didn't know it was you. Please, sir, have pity.
Don't harm an old woman.
You may take this body, but it will not be me. It will not be me!
[BANGING] Not again.
I now pronounce you man and wife. In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
Robin.
Do you mind, Locksley?
We've just been married.
Recognize this?
It belonged to your father.
Appropriate, don't you think, that I now use it to send you to meet him?
I shall never fear my father's sword.
Really? [GRUNTS] Aah!
Now we're even.
Robin!
If I must, I will take you a piece at a time.
I'll do the only taking today.
you sold your soul to Satan, Your Grace.
You accused innocent men of witchcraft and let them die.
Brother friar, you would not strike a fellow man of the cloth.
No. No, I wouldn't. In fact, I'll help you pack for your journey.
In fact, I'll help you pack for your journey. You're going to need lots of gold
You're going to need lots of gold to help you on your way.
You're a very rich man, huh? This too, huh?
Enough?
Here's 30 pieces of silver
to pay the devil on your way to hell!
Robin!
Get ready.
No!
I have fulfilled my vow, Sadiq.
You came for me.
You're alive.
I would die for you.
By the power vested in me by God's holy church,
I say any man who has reason why these two should not be joined,
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.
Then I now pronounce you-- MAN: Hold it. I speak.
MAN: Hold it. I speak.
Richard.
I will not allow this wedding to proceed-- My lord-- --unless...
My lord-- --unless...
I'm allowed to give the bride away.
You look radiant, cousin. Oh... Richard.
We are deeply honored, Your Majesty.
It is I who am honored, Lord Locksley.
Thanks to you, I still have a throne.
Friar, proceed.
My liege.
Husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
I know that.
Come on, get out of it.
You heard the bell. You know what it means. Last week,
the assignment was to write an essay about your family.
Who they… [all] Are!
And what they…
[all] Mean to us.
Excellent droning. So I want everyone to take out their essays.
We're going to read them aloud to the class right up here.
Mm, "My mom says that me and my dad have very healthy appetites."
"My mom and dad are very religious."
"When they're in their bedroom at night, I always hear them yelling, 'Jesus!'"
"My mom says my dad's eyes are brown because he is so full of sh--"
[teacher] Bryan!
"My brother Jack is in eighth grade."
"He told me to ask my dad who he voted for… for… for president."
"I did, and my Dad said he's a total Bush man."
"That made my brother laugh really hard." [laughs]
"Whenever my Uncle Stu comes over to play pool with my dad,
my mom says the basement smells like a Cheech and Chong movie."
Well, it's like this. My dog ate my paper.
-I checked, but he didn't poop it out. -[all laugh]
What a lovely sentiment, Mr. Etheridge.
Maybe your dog can eat the zero you'll be receiving too.
Aw, man!
Harsh.
Miss Trinke? It's your turn now.
[Gertie] "My dad says life can be split into two categories,
New Jersey and New York."
♪ Everyone's a kid at Christmas time ♪
[Gertie] My dad was a Jersey boy who became the youngest
and most successful music publicist in New York City.
By the time he was 27, he had 100 people working for him.
And even though they all loved him… -[clears throat] -[Gertie] …he loved them even more.
My fellow flacks and spin doctors,
-salud. -[all cheer]
[Gertie] Daddy loved his job, but not as much as he loved my mom.
Mommy was a book editor in New York City when her and Daddy met.
Daddy said their jobs were kind of the same.
They made slight corrections for their clients.
Because George Michael is a pimp who is all about the ladies, my friend.
Come on. "I Want Your Sex"? That sound like he's singing to a guy?
[Gertie] Daddy worked so much that sometimes Mommy could only see him late at night.
Daddy says that's why they both loved the city so much…
it never went to sleep.
And neither did him and Mommy.
But after a year of romance in New York City,
Daddy said it was time to show Mommy where he came from.
So he took her home to New Jersey and put her through what he said
was the biggest test their love would ever face.
Introducing her to my Pop. [Ollie] Hey!
-[chuckles] Hey, how are ya? -[Bart] How you doing?
-How are you doing yourself? -This is Gertrude.
-Hi. Merry Christmas. -Gertrude.
And what do you do, Mr. Trinke? Hey, easy on the "Mr. Trinke." It's Bart.
I work for the borough for 30 years now.
You're looking at the only man in Highlands licensed to operate the street sweeper.
Oh, man, I always wanted to ride in one of those things.
Well, you continue seeing my son… [clicks tongue] …I can probably get you a turn at the wheel.
You know, I was only gonna sleep with him a few more times and then dump him,
but now, after an offer like that…
Holy shit. Listen to the mouth on this one!
Oh, yeah, they don't make them like Mom anymore, do they, Dad?
[sighs] Now, listen, I'm going to the bar. What a shock.
If you guys are gonna do anything while I'm gone, stay the hell off of my bed.
[Gertrude] You're going to a bar? Didn't he tell ya? I'm an alcoholic.
Well, I wanna go to the bar too. Oh, no. You don't wanna go to this bar.
It's a bunch of old guys talking about how good they had it under Kennedy.
The man was a goddamn saint.
[Gertrude] Well, I'm going to the bar with your dad. You can come if you want.
No, that's okay. I'll stay here and do the dishes.
You know, I only cooked. Why shouldn't I clean?
[Bart] Suit yourself. But don't wash that pan.
I got a nice layer of juice built up for the pork roll, and I don't want you scrubbing it off.
That juice is called grease, Dad.
It's bad for you. It clogs your arteries.
It's called juice, and it greases a father's insides
so that he can better swallow the shit his son feeds him twice a year
when he can be bothered to come to visit him.
-["Let's Stay Together" playing] -[Gertie] So that night, Daddy took Mommy to Pop's bar,
where she got to meet Pop's other children,
his best friends Greenie and Block.
Hey, your kid's cutting a rug.
Who are you, Connie Chung?
[Gertie] Daddy said because Mommy survived her first trip to Jersey
he knew she was a keeper.
[Gertie] He said they celebrated their engagement by going out for pizza.
And that's how I got here.
You think we have enough of these at home, or should I steal some?
Put those away. If you're gonna steal something, steal some rubber gloves.
-Thanks, doc! -Thank you! [chuckles] You're welcome.
[Gertie] And with that, everyone lived happily ever after.
Almost.
All right, you got two minutes, and then we have to go, okay?
-Or I'm gonna leave. -Would you stop rushing me?
I just don't understand how somebody who had all day sitting around the house to get ready
waits till 20 minutes before we have to leave!
You try getting anything accomplished with this big gut in your way!
Do you not get it? This is one of the few days of the year that I can be fired for being late!
-Anytime that you wanna carry this baby… -That means I lose my job.
-I can't work anymore. We'll starve. -…you let me know. Okay.
I would be glad to go back to wearing regular dresses instead of this tent!
Oh, the dress looks fine. It's gorgeous, okay? It's beautiful.
Yeah, until I'm standing next to Janet Jackson or Sheryl Crow.
And then you'll see how not fine it looks.
Gertie, I asked you, please, to use your own brush, okay?
-Can you not use my brush? -Don't start, Ollie.
It's just that every… every time I wanna comb my hair
I spend 15 minutes taking these long bushy hairs out of my brush.
-[stammers] And I mean, you ask me to-- -[sobs]
[sighs] I'm sorry.
-Oh, baby, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -[sobs]
You don't understand what it's like to be this fat.
I know.
I've always been thin, and now I'm a disgusting pig!
And it's my first time going to the Video Music Awards
and all the other girls are gonna be skinny, and I'm gonna look like a whale! [sobs]
and I'm gonna look like a whale! [sobs] Baby, baby, they're… they're… they're just skinny 'cause they're all coked-out whores.
[sobs] I wanna be a coked-out whore!
Okay, you can be a coked-out whore too.
You can be a coked-out, coked-out whore.
-Oh, it's okay. -I'm sorry, Ollie. -I should be more sensitive. I'm sorry. -[sniffles]
-I should be more sensitive. I'm sorry. -[sniffles] I should be more sensitive, honey. I know.
-Yes. [sniffles] -I know.
-Baby, we have to go now, okay? -Okay. Okay.
-I love you. We have to go now, okay? -Okay.
-I love you too. Okay. -All right, let's go. Okay?
Just give me two minutes. [sobs]
-[Ollie] What time is it? -[Arthur] Uh, twenty after.
[Ollie] She's gonna kill me! [Arthur] Yeah, I still need the quote for the Madonna release.
Okay. Quote, "Madonna trusts the public will judge for itself that…
…uh, this latest in a long line of breakthrough music videos
is not the tasteless sexploitation it's accused of being."
"It's artistic expression." Unquote. Of what?
Of one woman's constant need to show the world…
-[music concludes] -…her labia.
Hey, can I use the word "labia" in a press release?
See you next week.
One of these days, I'm gonna get me one of those husbands that actually show up for Lamaze.
I'm sorry, babe. It was Madonna.
[Gertrude] So you were late because of another woman. That's nice.
-Come on. I still gotta do my job. -[Gertrude] And I still gotta do mine too.
But I was at Lamaze on time.
Look, all I'm saying is
that guy who used to spend all night at the office and barely live in his apartment,
that's not you anymore.
Now you have to be the guy who's done by six
and comes home and hangs out with his family.
That's the only way we're gonna work.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
-[Ollie] Okay. -Okay.
-Okay. -Okay.
-Can I help you? -[Ollie pants] Yes.
My wife's water broke. She's gonna have a baby.
You're gonna have to check in, hon. Check in? Where, at the concierge desk?
Check in? Where, at the concierge desk? Why are you being so combative with me?
First of all, take your hands off my uniform.
And second, I'm gonna need a patient here.
This is my wife. This is the belligerent nurse that's being difficult with me,
This is the belligerent nurse that's being difficult with me, giving me such a hard time.
I'm sorry. He's just a little panicky. -Can I get a wheelchair? -Okay.
-Let's get you up to delivery. -Okay.
And let him fill out the paperwork.
-Okay. -If we can trust him with a pen. Here, sweetie.
Okay, just relax. Breathe. Remember, take it easy.
I love you. I'll be right there, okay? I love you.
-I love you too. -Okay? I love you.
-Bye, baby. -We've practiced this a thousand times. It'll be great. How hard can it be?
Push! You're doing good. You're doing real good. I know it's hard.
-No, I can't. I can't do it. -You can do it. You can do it.
-It hurts! -I know it hurts. You can do it. -It hurts! -It's okay, baby.
-It hurts! -It's okay, baby. -[doctor] Push for me. Come on. -Push. -[sobs, exhales] No! -Take a deep breath. In five, four…
-[sobs, exhales] No! -Take a deep breath. In five, four…
-Okay? Here you go. Breathe. -…three, two, one.
-Push. Push harder, Gertie. Push harder. -[screams, sobs] No.
The baby's crowning. I can see her. -I just need one more push. -Can you see her?
-I just need one more push. -Can you see her? Holy shit! I can see the head.
[doctor] Come on. One more. Breathe. -In five, four… -Push! It's almost there, baby.
-You're doing it. Push! -[doctor] …three, two, one.
-Push! -[screams]
[doctor] Here she comes! Here she comes!
-Here she is. -[cries]
-Do you wanna cut the cord, dad? -Yeah.
[chuckles] Scissors, please.
Yes! [chuckles] And she's got all ten fingers, ten toes.
We'll get her all cleaned up and then we're gonna check…
-[EKG machine beeping] -Gertie?
-[Ollie] Baby, look. -[doctor] Gertie?
Gertie!
Gertie, can you hear me?
-She's okay-- Sweetheart? -[doctor] Nurse. Nurse, get Dr. Mortimer right away.
[Ollie] She's just resting. Who's Dr. Mortimer?
[nurse] Dr. Mortimer!
-[Ollie] What's happening? -[doctor] She's unresponsive.
-Gertie! -Gertie! Gertie!
Gertie, Gertie, it's me! Gertie?
[doctor] Healthy baby. Unresponsive.
-Respiratory arrest. -[nurse] Turn it around!
What's happening to my wife? Let's open that IV, please.
Baby, are you okay? Sweetheart, sweetheart, wake up!
Please, someone take Mr. Trinke outside. Please!
I'm gonna have to intubate.
Gertie, wake up, my love. Wake up.
Gertie, please. Wake up.
Get off me! Gertie! [speaks indistinctly]
I wanna stay with my wife! Gertie! Gertie!
What's happening? Somebody just tell me--
Ollie… Hey, if I don't get to go in there right now,
-I swear to God! -Ollie… Ollie,
-calm down. -Fuck you, calm down! Okay?
I got dragged out of there, I haven't got to see my baby!
Your baby is fine. She's healthy, she's normal.
What's wrong with Gertie? What happened? I just-- I need you to calm down before I--
Look, I'm calm! Okay?
I'm calm.
We think Gertie had an aneurysm.
Is she okay?
We lost her, Ollie.
The strain of the contractions and the pushing must have caused the aneurysm to rupture.
There are rarely symptoms for aneurysms…
♪ That's how I knew the story Would break my heart ♪
[Ollie] You sure you're okay with this, Dad?
What okay? She's my granddaughter.
-[baby cries] -Yeah, you can stay with me anytime, can't you?
Yes, you can.
Until you're a teenager, with the boys and the reefer.
-Then I don't wanna know about you. -[coos]
I wouldn't impose on you, you know.
I just got a lot of work piled up from, uh, before and…
-I'll be back late tonight, okay? -[Bart] Yeah, take your time.
Your daddy really misses your mommy, kid.
I miss her too.
Especially right now.
-[baby farts] -Oh, Jesus! [exhales]
Yeah.
-You wanted to see me, Ollie? -Yeah, come on in.
I didn't think you were gonna be in this week. How you doing, man? You… you all right?
How you doing, man? You… you all right? I'm… I'm fine.
Look, this piece in the Post. Why didn't you call me when this broke? I had to read about it in New Jersey.
Why didn't you call me when this broke? I had to read about it in New Jersey. I covered it, Ollie. It's cool. The nurse is a fan.
Will she still be a fan when the Enquirer flashes a stack of fifties in her face?
Listen, something like this breaks, I'm not in the city,
you find me or you find another job.
Yeah, okay.
[sighs] Okay.
What else do we got?
Um, Will Smith.
Who? The Fresh Prince?
DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Fresh Prince?
-[Arthur] Yeah. -What about him?
Well, uh, you remember the first album, -with "Girls Ain’t Nothing but Trouble"? -Rock the House. Yeah?
-with "Girls Ain’t Nothing but Trouble"? -Rock the House. Yeah? Rock the House. Right.
Well, uh, you remember on the cover of… of the album Jazzy Jeff is… is holding a model of a house?
Vaguely.
Well, Will Smith is donating that house to the Hard Rock Cafe.
Well, stop the presses. You put the word out yet?
Date pending, yeah. -Anybody give a shit? -Every outlet wants in.
-Anybody give a shit? -Every outlet wants in.
-You're kidding me. -[Arthur] No.
Even US News & World Report.
Why? It's an eight-year-old album.
Doesn't matter. Everyone loves that Fresh Prince TV show.
He… he's got that movie coming out in a couple of weeks, uh, Independence Day.
Well, then, kick it up to 30. Let the film division handle it. No, we can't.
Will wants to keep his music career separate from his movie career.
Like the Fresh Prince of Bel Air is ever gonna have a movie career.
All right. Get me everything you can. I'll put together a press kit on him, and we'll just do it.
-Okay. -Patty, get me Kirsch.
-Okay. -Patty, get me Kirsch. [Patty through telephone] Sure, Ollie.
You know, Ollie, I can handle this, uh, Fresh Prince stuff if… if you wanna take a couple of days…
Hey, Arthur, I can do my job. I'm all set, okay? You do your job. Go ahead.
Patty, did you not hear me? l asked you to please get Kirsch on the phone.
-Ollie? -[Patty] I'm trying.
What, man?
I… I know I told you at the funeral, but I'm… I'm really sorry…
I'm fine! Okay, Arthur? I am fine. Please go do what I asked you to do now.
-[Patty] Kirschner on one. -Okay, put him on the phone, then!
-Hey, how's the baby? -The baby is fine, Arthur!
Forget about the baby! I just wanna do my job!
[Kirschner] Jesus Christ, Ollie! What the hell you screaming about?
-Patty, was that-- -[telephone beeps]
-[baby crying] -[Ollie] Yeah, I'm working on that right now, Arthur. Don't worry about that.
Just get there early and deal with the menu, okay?
-[baby crying] -Hey! Are you deaf? The kid is crying up there.
Yeah. Can you deal with that? I'm doing something important right here, Dad, okay? Thanks.
What the hell could be more important than your kid crying?
I have a memorabilia donation ceremony in the morning
that my company is treating like a… a… a royal wedding
'cause apparently the client's the most beloved American musician -since Elvis Presley, all right? -[baby continues crying]
The kid's been screaming for the last ten minutes.
If it bothers you so much, go up there and give her a bottle, okay?
Sorry. It's a nightmare trying to work at this house. Um…
-[baby crying continuously] -[sighs] Jesus! Let me call you back, okay?
What, Dad? Listen, kid. I lost a wife too, remember?
Listen, kid. I lost a wife too, remember? So I get how you're feeling. But come on.
You were married for what, 20 years? I got about 20 minutes.
So you don't "get" how I'm feeling at all, okay?
Well, I'm sorry, Oliver, but that don't change the fact that you're a goddamn father now
and you haven't acted like it since that kid got home from the hospital.
I been calling in sick for a month to do the things you're supposed to be doing.
Jesus Christ, if Gertie could see the shit you've been pulling…
Gertie doesn't see anything anymore, Dad. She's dead.
-[baby crying continuously] -Yeah, she's dead.
But you ain't. And neither is that kid.
Yeah. It's nothing. Uh…
All right, so I'm gonna do the kit. It's almost finished. You deal with the menu. We'll--
It's almost finished. You deal with the menu. We'll-- Yeah. What time does Will get there? Okay.
-[baby crying] -Dad, the baby's up!
Dad, the baby needs to be fed!
Dad!
[Bart] What the hell?
Are you nuts? What, are you trying to get killed?
What are you doing? Searching for Christ. What does it look like I'm doing?
It would have been nice if you'd told me you were leaving the house, Dad.
That way, I could've given you the baby instead of driving all the way down here.
Now I'm gonna hit traffic. No, you ain't giving me the baby.
Hey! Excuse me?
I got uptown and downtown to do this morning.
You're on your own with the kid today. What? No!
I have this press conference l have to do this morning. Dad, you know that.
I got a job to do too. This is not funny. I'm not kidding. If I don't leave right now…
-So leave. -And do what with the baby?
-Take her with you. -Goddamnit! I--
All right look, I… I know I haven't been helping out that much with the baby…
Listen to you. "Helping out that much with the baby."
She's your daughter, for Chrissake!
What the hell am I supposed to do with her? Try acting like her father, shithead!
Goddamnit!
Folks, I'm sorry.
Sorry. Steve.
What the…
I ordered diapers. Did they get here yet? You mean, like, baby diapers?
[Ollie] Why didn't you start this half an hour ago? -You shouldn't have waited. -We're not waiting for you.
-You shouldn't have waited. -We're not waiting for you. -We're waiting for Will. -Will's not here?
No. -Either of you guys Trinket? -Close enough.
-Either of you guys Trinket? -Close enough. -Where is he? -Ah, we're not sure.
Damn, that baby smells like shit. You know that, right?
[Arthur] It's a good thing you finally showed up.
They… they're getting all rowdy out there. -Oh, Mother of God! -[baby crying]
-What? Jesus… -Ollie!
Ollie, the guy from Rolling Stone-- Holy shit! What is that smell?
Oh, grow up, Susan. It's a dirty diaper. What did the Rolling Stone guy say?
If we don't start in five minutes, they're leaving
to go cover the Blues Traveler signing at Tower.
Jesus Christ! Hey, you're doing that wrong.
-What? -You're doing that wrong.
You're supposed to wipe front to back. You're wiping back to front.
You do that, you're just wiping the poop into her…
crevice.
Get outta here. Beat it.
Mark my words, you're gonna give her the crotch-rot.
-Would one of you do-- You do this. -Oh, not me. No.
Will you do this so I can calm them down?
Why, because I'm a girl? I've never even seen a naked baby. No!
Fine. Thank you very much. I'm gonna remember this.
-How much of this am I supposed to use? -Should I get that guy back?
He sounded like he knew a lot about changing babies.
If it's for the smell, I suggest you use a lot.
Ooh, you gotta turn… turn it. Turn it. You gotta turn the top!
-Direct it at the baby. -Thank you, Susan.
Go out there, please, and tell them we're about to start.
I… I'd say more.
That's a lot.
-[song concludes] -All right, the Fresh Prince is almost here.
Is that blow on your shirt?
What do you think, Stretch? This is show business, right?
That was a joke, people. Where's the Fresh Prince?
-The Fresh Prince is on his way. -[baby crying]
-It's crying. Will you take it? -No! No.
-Is that Jazzy Jeff? -[all laugh]
This is bullshit! Where's the Fresh Prince?
Will someone please shut that girl up?
Enough with the Romper Room, man. Bring out the Fresh Prince!
-Fresh Prince! -[all chant] Fresh Prince! Fresh Prince!
Please take her.
I…
Goddamnit! Just give her to me! Give me the baby.
-[all] Fresh Prince! Fresh Prince! -That's not a good idea.
Would you people just shut the hell up with the "Fresh Prince" already?
He's a two-bit TV actor
who won't be around any longer than it takes for the ink to dry
on the pages of the worthless rags you jerk-offs write for!
Shit.
-That guy's toast. -That's a hell of a quote.
It's all right, Arthur. It's all right.
We won't be here too long, Dad, you know, we'll be out of your hair
We won't be here too long, Dad, you know, we'll be out of your hair as soon as I get another job.
I have some feelers out to the other firms right now.
As soon as this whole thing blows over…
Well, it's okay to stay here as long as you need to, till you get back on your feet.
-I appreciate that. -On one condition.
Yeah, here we go.
You put the kid to bed every night.
-That's it? -[Bart] For starters. -[sighs] -And no whores.
-[sighs] -And no whores. I don't want no whores in my house.
I'm not really a whoremonger, Dad.
Here, the kid gets this.
That's cute. Eight o'clock you both get a bottle.
[chuckles sarcastically] Just shut the hell up and go be a father, would you, please?
[Ollie] No?
Yeah, this is only temporary, us, you know,
living with your grandfather here.
[clicks tongue] So…
How about that Fresh Prince thing, huh?
-It was quite a show. -[coos]
Your dad's one big horse's ass.
Daddy's ex-bosses said the guys who did PR for Hitler
have a better chance of working in this business again than Daddy does.
So, okay…
How you doing?
You know, you kinda look like your mom.
Like a squishier, balder version of your mom.
Man,
I just wish you could've gotten to meet your mom.
I know she wanted to meet you… in a big, bad way.
In a big, bad way.
Sometimes, Daddy wishes he'd have died instead of Mommy.
Because Mommy never would've…
let work get in the way of
getting to know you, like Daddy has for the last… month or so.
It's just that Daddy, he didn't expect Mommy…
[sighs] …to leave the way she did.
[sighs] It's just really, really hard on Daddy, who's been trying to fill up his days with work,
so he wouldn't have to think about Mommy… [sobs] …never being around again.
I just loved your mom so much. You know?
She really lit my world on fire. [sniffles]
When that happens…
you kinda think it'll go on like that until one of you dies. You know? You just don't expect… [sobs]
You know? You just don't expect… [sobs]
I miss her so much. So, so much.
And you're a little piece of Mommy, you know, and that makes you really special to Daddy.
[Ollie] Just don't go anywhere.
'Cause you're the next best thing to Mommy, and I love you so much,
and I'll always be here for you,
and I'm sorry about the way I've been acting.
I promise you… I'll be better now.
I'm gonna be the best daddy in the world.
'Cause that's what Mommy wanted. And that's what you deserve.
And that's all I am now.
[exhales] I'm just your dad.
Your dad likes to run off at the mouth sometimes, I know.
Your mother wasn't a fan, either. -[coos] -[Ollie chuckles]
You wanna see a picture of your mom? I have one.
This was your mommy. She was really pretty.
Okay. You can keep it.
Daddy's got a bunch.
There you go.
Good night, Gertie.
-[school bell ringing] -[children shouting]
[Ollie] Gertie!
Your chariot awaits, Princess. Let's go.
We gotta go! Come on! Argh!
♪ To fly her skies ♪ [Ollie] How was school? Good?
-You have a nice time? -Yep.
[Ollie] Remember to put your seat belt on. -Know where to find it? -[Gertie] Yep.
-Know where to find it? -[Gertie] Yep.
[Ollie] Lock and load.
Coming around.
Get ready.
-Ready? -[Gertie] Punch it, Chewie.
-Can we go see Cats? -Absolutely not.
Why?
Because Cats was the second worst thing that ever happened to New York City.
Besides, Cats closed three years ago. We never do anything cool.
Oh, you're riding in the Batmobile, aren't you? How cool is that?
Oh, my God.
Look, no one's more depressed than me that driving the street sweeper
is considered the height of excitement in my life.
I used to live in New York City.
I could've gone to see Cats three times a day.
It's not like I ever ask for anything.
And the Oscar goes to Gertie Trinke,
for her performance in Laying It On Thick For My Old Man.
What is it with you and Cats all of a sudden?
I wanna sing a Cats song in the big show like everybody else.
-What big show? -There's gonna be this big show at school.
All the people have to sing a song with people from their family.
Are you inviting me to this big show? Duh! Yeah, you and Pop too.
Oh-ho, I'm sure that'll go over huge with your Pop.
Can Uncle Greenie and Uncle Block be in it too?
Those men are not your uncles. -They're barely even your peers. -Pee-ers? [chuckles]
-They're barely even your peers. -Pee-ers? [chuckles]
When is this big show? Right before Thanksgiving break.
Does it have to be something from the Bible?
I don't think so. Is Cats in the Bible?
The Satanic Bible, yes.
What? When you gonna take the kid to see the Cats?
Jesus. You too?
Gertie!
Do you even know what Cats is, Dad?
What, I don't read the papers? You don't read that paper.
What are you doing with the New York Times?
They ran out of the Ledger.
They don't have the jumble in the Times, Dad.
Shit.
-Where were you? -I was in the bathroom.
Uh-huh. Why didn't I hear the toilet flush? Oh, I forgot. [chuckles]
Yeah, okay, march your butt back upstairs and flush that toilet.
And when I say "no" about something,
like, I don't know, Cats, maybe, I mean no, okay?
Pop, you were supposed to be subtle! Why do you teach her words like that?
You're gonna have to mow the park for me tomorrow. I can't do it.
Why the hell not? I have an appointment in the city at 11:00.
Jesus, kid, why do you keep doing it to yourself?
How many of these interviews you gotta go on
before you get it through your thick head
they don't want you in that business anymore?
For Chrissakes, you made fun of that Prince Charles guy.
-[toilet flushing] -Thank you!
First of all, Dad, I didn't make fun of anybody.
I made one remark about Will Smith, the Fresh Prince.
Sooner or later, everyone's gonna forget about that,
and I'm gonna go back to doing what I'm really good at,
instead of sweeping streets and plowing snow and picking up garbage. Okay?
and plowing snow and picking up garbage. Okay?
Well, if you're going into the city anyway, at least take the kid to see the Cats.
[Ollie sighs] Oh, God…
I'll tell you what. Since there is no more Cats,
Gertie, why don't you come on over here and pick out another play that you wanna see, all right?
Look through here. Anything you want. Go nuts.
The Cats is a show? [scoffs] Yeah, you read the papers.
You think you're slick, don't you, young lady?
Lemme tell you something. Next time you're looking for a partner in crime,
you're gonna have to aim higher than your grandfather.
-[whispers] He's soft in the head. -[Bart] I heard that!
-[Ollie exhales] -Here. Can we go see this show?
[Ollie] Sweeney Todd? You know that this has a lot of singing, right?
It's still a play. Okay. I'm just checking, 'cause, you know…
Your dad one time lost a bet with someone at his work,
and he had to go see a singing play, um, done by people on roller skates.
Cool! Your dad didn't think so.
I handled primarily recording artists,
but when I initially trained, I trained in film PR, so I can do that too.
l, uh… took the last six or seven years off. I was raising my daughter in New Jersey.
But I kept abreast, so I'm pretty comfortable jumping back in.
[clicks tongue] What else can I tell you guys? Uh…
That's it. I can start, you know, right away.
You guys all right?
Are you the Ollie Trinke? The one who used to work at Mandel-Kirschner?
Yeah, that was me… -[Reynolds] Son of a bitch! -Yes! I told you, Reynolds. Pay up!
[Reynolds] I got it. Am I missing something?
Nah, nah, he just bet me you were the Ollie Trinke,
the one who pulled "The Fresh Prince."
They named it? Of course! Are you kidding? You're a legend, man.
Of course! Are you kidding? You're a legend, man.
You did what every flack only dreams about doing.
Oh, which was what? You went apeshit. You trashed your client back to the Stone Age.
You went apeshit. You trashed your client back to the Stone Age.
-Right. -[PR exec 1] Yeah. We bow to you, man. You're like a god around here.
We bow to you, man. You're like a god around here. -[PR exec 2] Yep, exactly. -God enough to get a job?
-[PR exec 2] Yep, exactly. -God enough to get a job? -No. -[both laugh]
-What are you, insane? -[PR exec 2] No chance, Trinke. -[Reynolds] Oh, man. No. -[both laughing]
-Pop, I'm home. -[Bart] Yeah, like I give a shit.
You know, thanks a lot, Pop.
That's what it looks like? I guess. What does yours look like?
I guess. What does yours look like? Not like that.
Yeah? Let me see.
All right.
[Ollie] Gertie, it's time for Bryan to go home.
Okay.
What are your intentions?
What are your intentions with my daughter?
Do you plan on marrying her? I don't know.
Well, only married boys and girls…
[clears throat] …show each other their, uh…
their, you know, uh…
parts, okay?
Okay, Bryan… [sighs] …you can go now. If you come back, come back with a ring.
Yes, Mr. Trinke.
-Bye, Gertie. -[Gertie] Bye.
Goodbye, Bryan.
Okay.
Do you have any, uh…
questions about what you,
you know…
you know, whatever, saw?
Do you have what Bryan has?
Yes, I have one… too.
Is yours as big as his?
Sadly, yes.
-Can we rent a movie? -Yes.
[Gertie] So they wouldn't give you a job, huh? [Ollie] No. But apparently, Daddy's a legend.
[Gertie] You don't need that job anyway. You already got a job.
Yes, well, Daddy used to have a job
where a nightly shower was an option, not a necessity.
where a nightly shower was an option, not a necessity. -You know what job you should do? -What's that?
You should be a dance teacher, like Johnny in Dirty Dancing.
I should? Should I say, "Nobody puts Baby in a corner"?
Oh, can we rent Dirty Dancing again?
Ugh, Dirty Dancing ranks one notch below Cats in my book.
Can you pick out something else?
Can we rent this?
Absolutely not. Go pick out something from the children's section.
-All those movies suck. -Watch your language.
Nah, that's…
No, I guess that's it. Yep, yep, that's it.
I'll just take this and whatever the kid's getting.
Just go ahead and put it in the bag. I'm all set.
It's good.
"Bi-Bi Guys, featuring Curious Jordie"?
Interesting choice. Does the wife know you're looking into your options?
It's-- I got the…
-I got the wrong box by accident. -Oh, right.
[clears throat] Would you mind, uh, exchanging that for me for something…
You know, whatever, anything you can get your hands on that's, you know…
So, then you want something… That's non-bi.
Can I have your membership card, please?
Yeah, sure.
Would you mind if I asked you a few questions about your renting practices?
-Uh… sure. -Really? Uh…
Do you always rent adult titles with your daughter in tow, or is this the first time?
Excuse me?
Oh, when you rent porn, do you usually do it with family around,
or is this like a, you know, special occasion? [chuckles]
Do I have to… to answer this? I'm a grad student, I'm writing a thesis paper,
"A Bird in the Hand: The Family Man and the Pornographic Fixation."
Okay. I would rather not take part.
Really?
Frank, is Bi-Bi Guys -a one or a two-night rental? -[Ollie shushes]
What are you getting, Daddy? Yeah, daddy, what are you getting? Let's just take a look.
Let's not, okay?
Would you mind not asking me those questions when my daughter's with me?
-How about when you bring these back? -[device beeps]
That's-- Yeah.
In an effort to get honest feedback, I'd appreciate it if you left the kid and the wife at home.
My mom's dead. She died when I was born.
[Maya] Oh, Jesus.
-Man, uh… I'm sorry. I didn't… -No,
-Man, uh… I'm sorry. I didn't… -No, you didn't.
Let's go.
I'm sorry. Aw, do I have to?
Aw, do I have to?
Major Damage didn't have to go to bed when he fought the Tiki Terrors.
-[mom] Melvin! -[laughs]
-[Melvin] And he didn't have to… -[knocking on door] -I'll get it. -You will not.
-I'll get it. -You will not. You're not even supposed to be up this late.
Watch your video.
-[Melvin] But Mom! -[mom] Say, "Okay, Mom."
-[Melvin] Aw! -[mom] Say, "Okay, Mom."
Hi.
Hey! You're the lady from the video store.
Let's not use that term too loosely, okay? -[chuckles] -[Ollie] Go back and watch your video.
Yes?
I uh… I just wanted to come here and tell you
that I'm… I'm really sorry about earlier tonight.
I… I feel like shit about what I said and your daughter and everything.
Well, you should.
You know that kid was crying in the car the whole way home?
-Oh, no. -No, I wasn't.
-[chuckles] -Get back inside and watch your video. [Maya] Nice! Real nice.
See, now you have to let me interview you for my paper.
Is that why you're here?
I just think you'd make one hell of an interesting case study.
The sympathetic widower who doesn't have time to date 'cause he's raising his kid, so he rents porn instead.
'cause he's raising his kid, so he rents porn instead. I mean, I think that's very interesting stuff.
Jesus Christ! You've got some nerve, lady.
And besides, I… I'd really like to make it up to you
for what I said, and for embarrassing you before that.
You're really having a banner evening. You're batting a thousand tonight.
You're Ollie, right? I'm Maya Harding.
-"Hi, Maya. Nice to meet you." -Hi.
Come on, why don't you let me take you out one day this week?
You do eat lunch when you're not knee-deep in adult movies, right? [chuckles]
I appreciate it, but, no, thanks.
Ollie, come on, you're ruining my karma level here.
What, buying me one lunch is gonna square you with Krishna?
Hare! Hare! [laughs]
Is Monday okay? Sound good?
I mean, I was thinking nothing fancy. I was thinking maybe, like, the diner.
Around noon? No!
[laughs] Noon it is!
See you there. Bye!
-An incredibly strange woman. -[car engine revving]
I did not hear the toilet flush.
Thank you.
[Gertie] Can we get popcorn? This isn't the movies, sweetheart. They don't sell popcorn here.
This isn't the movies, sweetheart. They don't sell popcorn here. This is Broadway. This is class.

[Ollie] Okay, now, you see that floor. Now look three windows in from the right.
-See that window? -Yeah.
That's where we used to live before we lived with Pop.
We'd still live there if we lived in the city.
-If Mommy was still alive? -Yep.
-Dad? -Yes?
Do you miss Mommy?
I do. Every day.
What was she like? I've told you a million times what she was like.
I know, but I forget. No, I don't think you forget. You just like to hear me tell you.
No, I don't think you forget. You just like to hear me tell you. Which is okay. It's all right.
You can ask about your mommy as much as you want.
So tell me already.
Well, she was pushy, like you were right there.
She was beautiful, like you are right now.
And she was…
smart and strong, like you'll grow up to be one day.
-I'm smart now. -[Ollie] I know.
I wasn't impugning your intelligence or anything.
What's "impugning" mean?
Oh, not so smart now, are ya?
-That's a big word. -Yes, you're right, it is.
Let's see. To impugn means to criticize.
So… Pop's always impugning you, right?
Well, he thinks he is.
But really, he's just talking to make sure he's still alive.
-Pop is a very, very old man. -[chuckles]
What do you think? You like the city?
It's okay. But I like Highlands better.
-You do? -[Gertie] Yeah.
My school's there and my friends. And we can rent movies there.
Well, if memory serves, you can rent movies here too.
Yeah, but not from that pretty lady at the video store.
Oh, you think she's pretty, do you? Don't you? Isn't that why you're taking her on a date?
Don't you? Isn't that why you're taking her on a date?
It's not a date. The only girl I take on dates is you, okay?
-This is a date. We're on a date. -We are?
-Mm-hmm. -It doesn't feel like a date. It doesn't?
Well, I can fix that.
Sir?
[Maya] So, question one. How often do you rent adult movies?
[sighs] Do I really have to do this? I don't think you have anything to be ashamed about.
Interest in adult film can be healthy, as long as it's not habitual.
So come on, how often?
Three or four times a week.
Okay, maybe I was wrong. You should be ashamed. [laughs]
You have a real talent for making the subject feel open
and comfortable in a safe environment.
So, you're renting it presumably to masturbate to, right?
-Good God! -Oh, come on, don't be such a tight-ass.
-We're all adults here. -I know I'm an adult.
-We're all adults here. -I know I'm an adult. How old are you, exactly?
-I'll be 26 in March. -Twenty-six?
You haven't learned there are things that aren't polite to talk about in public?
If it makes you feel any better, I do it, like, twice a day.
-Good God! -What can I tell ya? I get bored easily.
You… you're gonna… get carpal tunnel syndrome.
[laughs] Don't get all judgmental with me. You're no slouch yourself.
-Well, no, I… -I just have a healthy sexual appetite.
Why don't you go out and get yourself a boyfriend?
Why don't you just go out and get yourself a girlfriend?
I work all day, hang out with my kid all night.
So you'd rather hang out with your kid than get laid?
Yeah.
That's kinda sweet.
I'm kinda crushing on you right now, Trinke.
Okay. Can I go home now?
No. When was the last time you had sex?
I would rather not disclose that information.
Oh, come on, don't clam up on me now.
You're gonna remain anonymous in my paper.
[chuckles] Anonymity doesn't concern me. Embarrassment does.
Why would you be embarrassed? Because it's been a long time.
How long?
A long time.
Come on, champ. Own it. Just put it out there.
I swear I won't make any editorial cracks about it.
-Not in front of you, at least. [chuckles] -[scoffs]
Seven years.
Seven years?
Since my wife died, yeah.
You know, a dumbfounded, mouth-agape look of shock
might be construed by some as an editorial crack too.
-I'm sorry. -It's okay. It's fine.
No, it's not. I mean, it's not at all.
With all due respect to your wife, you gotta get back on the horse, man.
No, I don't, actually. -Yes, you do. -No, I don't.
-Yes, you do. -No, I don't. Yes, you-- Get up.
-Are we done? -With this, for now. But come with me.
Lord have mercy.
Where are we going? To your place. We're gonna have some sex.
To your place. We're gonna have some sex.
What, did you forget something? No. Look, I… I appreciate the offer. [chuckles softly]
I'm very flattered. But I can't do this.
What's the matter? Don't you think I'm cute?
-Of course. I think you're cute. -Well, then?
Look, I'm not just celibate because of my daughter.
There are a lot of emotional issues in it too.
I mean, my wife may be dead, I'm still very much in love with her.
Hey, I respect that. I mean, look, I'm not telling you to fall in love with me here,
I mean, look, I'm not telling you to fall in love with me here, and I'm not trying to replace your wife.
I'm talking about two consenting adults having some casual sex.
Probably some really short… [chuckles] …casual sex, with you being a little out of practice.
I can't do it, I'm sorry. What are you, a monk?
God! Let's look at this logically, okay? You rent porn and touch yourself, right?
God! Let's look at this logically, okay? You rent porn and touch yourself, right? Would you lower your voice?
If you're not sweating how your wife would feel about you and porn,
then you shouldn't sweat what I'm proposing 'cause it's the same thing.
Only somebody else is doing the touching and you're saving a two-dollar rental fee.
Come on, stud. Man cannot live on porn alone.
Oh, God.
I'm home!
Pop?
Oh, my God. What do I do?
Get in the bathroom!
Pop? Uh, no, honey, it's me.
[Gertie] Daddy? Why aren't you at work?
Uh, because I had to come home and… and… and do-- Uh, I had to… come home and… take a shower.
Uh, I had to… come home and… take a shower.
Can we rent a movie? Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
Soon as I get done up here and dry off, I'll come down.
Okay.
Oh, my God that was so close.
-[laughs] -What do we do now? I'm wet.
-Sorry, Dad, I forgot again. -[flushing]
Hi, honey.
You remember Maya. From the video store.
What are your intentions? Excuse me?
What are your intentions with my father? Like, do you plan on marrying him?
-Uh… I don't… -[Ollie groans softly]
Because I was taught that only married girls show their girl parts to boys. Right, Daddy?
show their girl parts to boys. Right, Daddy?
right. Yes.
Can we rent all the movies we want for free?
What?
Can we rent all the movies we want for free?
Yes! Yes, yes. For God's sake, yes. If it means we're not, you know,
For God's sake, yes. If it means we're not, you know, that we're not in trouble anymore.
And-- Right, Maya? Yes!
-Uh… whatever you want. lt's on the house. -Yes.
Even Dirty Dancing?
Yeah.
And we can do Sweeney Todd for the show at school?
What?
We can do Sweeney Todd for the show at school?
No, honey, that's too grown-up. Really?
Oh, man, what am I gonna tell Pop about you guys?
Fine. We can do Sweeney Todd for the show at school.
Okay!
-Would you shut the hell up already? -Christ, Greenie, you're always--
-Oh, Jesus. -Oh!
Christ Almighty. You wearing a… wearing a towel.
Just as long as you didn't do it on my bed.
Oh, Jesus Christ, it was one time in high school! You wanna let it go already?
I banged a broad in my parents' bed once. It was nice.
Terrific. Just so you know, we didn't "bang."
What, did ya get to third base?
No, not that it's any of your business, but we didn't do anything.
We lost our heads for a second, then cooler heads prevailed
and we stopped before we did anything we'd both regret.
-The kid busted in on them. -[both] Oh.
Let's talk about something else, like this water main.
How bad is it? -Definitely needs to be replaced. -Jesus Christ.
-Definitely needs to be replaced. -Jesus Christ. If we gotta shut down Bay Avenue for that, this town is gonna throw a shit fit.
If we gotta shut down Bay Avenue for that, this town is gonna throw a shit fit.
I'm sure.
Hey, kid, you haven't had to inconvenience the taxpayers on the job yet.
They get like animals. Remember back in '88?
-South Peak Street. -Holy shit.
-South Peak Street. -Holy shit. I thought they were gonna crucify us upside down.
Like St. Peter. Who are you, the Holy Father?
Everybody knows I meant St. Peter. -You don't have to explain my shit. -I'm just saying.
-You don't have to explain my shit. -I'm just saying.
When I was down there, how many cars did you wave around?
Three or four.
Three or four cars for the whole half-hour I was down there?
Well, it was rush hour.
Yeah, I don't think the legion of commuters in the Highlands of New Jersey are gonna object to us closing down
in the Highlands of New Jersey are gonna object to us closing down a small portion of Bay Avenue for a few days.
-[gavel banging continuously] -[clamoring] [comptroller] One at a time, please. One at a time.
-We're doing the best we can. -[Bart] You were saying?
Why doesn't somebody just go up there and explain to them what's actually happening?
Why don't you do it, Daddy? Wasn't that your old job?
Making people like singers by saying nice things about them?
-Yes, baby, but-- -No, the kid's got a point there.
As a guy who used to sling bullshit for a living,
I nominate you to go up there and say something.
-Oh, you do, huh? -Yeah.
-It can't hurt. -Go ahead.
-Thanks, Pop. -[indistinct chatter]
Stay right here. I'll be back.
[comptroller] Control yourselves…
He's going up there.
Folks, one second. Please. Folks.
Uh, my name's Oliver Trinke and, uh, I'm with the borough.
So I guess that makes me the least popular guy in the room.
I want to assure you that, uh, this Bay Avenue job
I want to assure you that, uh, this Bay Avenue job will be a very minimal inconvenience. It'll only take three days at the most.
will be a very minimal inconvenience. It'll only take three days at the most.
[man] Bullshit! Bullshit!
-Bullshit! -[indistinct chatter]
Folks, please, a little decorum! A little decorum!
♪ And all this wandering ♪ Folks, one second.
I just have one more thing that I… I just want to add.
Look, I live in this town. I see you guys heading to work every day…
[Ollie] I'm telling you, it was amazing!
I get up there, and I weave this web of bullshit so profoundly mesmerizing, I turn the entire place around.
so profoundly mesmerizing, I turn the entire place around. You silver-tongued devil, you.
Everything I was saying was just right on the money, you know?
Maybe that's 'cause you weren't slinging as much bullshit as you thought you were.
"Get out there and play in the dirt"? -[laughs] -I mean, what… I made that up.
Sounds pretty good to me. -Hey, Gert. -[Gertie] Hi.
The sad thing is, I had a greater sense of accomplishment from this stupid water-main thing
than anything else I've done in the past seven years.
I get it. You set out to do something and you did it.
So you feel drunk with power now. Makes sense.
That's just it. I was the youngest flack ever put in charge of an entire division--
In the history of Mandel-Kirschner.
-I know. -That's an accomplishment.
Convincing a town to approve something that's already in their best interest?
That's just delayed common sense. Yeah, but that's your life now.
I mean, being the youngest flack in the history of blah, blah, blah…
That's not you anymore. I mean, that might never have been you.
Oh, it was me. It was me with my own apartment…
-[chuckles] -…me richer, me with more self-respect.
Like it or not, this is you.
I mean, forget about what you thought you were and just accept who you are.
I guess I'll just get this. Gert, what are you doing?
I distinctly remember your father telling you you could get Dirty Dancing.
Oh, yeah! -He did! -Yeah.
Thanks for that, by the way.
Incidentally, she's been asking me when she's gonna grow boobies like yours.
-[laughs] Oh, my God! -She's seven, okay?
If you want, I can give her the old boobie talk my mom gave me when I was a kid.
Does that talk include using the word "knockers"?
-Oh!. -I'm just saying.
I'm… I'm glad there's no, you know, awkwardness between us.
After the… Well, the thing that happened last week with…
Ollie, I was gonna give you a mercy jump. [chuckles]
The moment passed. It's no big deal.
Just friends, right? Yeah, friends.
-"Mercy jump." -[chuckles] -Stay away from my kid. -[laughs]
-No, that's too round. -[Block] Shut up.
-Just make a little rounder-- -[Block] Shut up! -Just a little rounder on that edge-- -Shut up! Shut up.
-Would you shut the hell up? -All right!
There's people getting their throats cut in this thing.
Yep.
And your father said you could do this for the show?
Yep.
Why the hell would he okay you singing this shit?
Because I saw him and Maya naked in the shower.
Oh, yeah. [chuckles]
That'll do it.
[Ollie] Can I speak with an Arthur Brickman, please?
-Ollie. -[Ollie] Arthur.
-Hey, man. How're you doing? -Good. How are you?
-Hey, man. How're you doing? -Good. How are you? -Good. Good to see you. -Good to see you.
It was-- You know, the town voted unanimously, -approved the water main, so… -You were always great with a crowd.
-approved the water main, so… -You were always great with a crowd.
Well, except that… that once, of course.
But that's it. It was the polar opposite of the Fresh Prince incident.
It was like I was on the top of my game.
Which is why I wanted to see ya.
Uh, I wanna ask you a favor. Yeah, anything, man. What?
Is there any way that you could get me an interview with your firm?
You're serious?
I thought it was weird that you wanted to eat here.
Oh, I know it's gonna be tough, don't get me wrong. Tough? [scoffs]
Ollie, uh, you… you called a roomful of press a bunch of jerk-offs
and… and trashed a client whose one of the biggest movie stars on the planet.
He wasn't big then. No, but he is now. You wanna know how big?
No, but he is now. You wanna know how big? When I left Mandel-Kirschner,
there were some firms that wouldn't even look at my resume because I…
No offense, but because I worked under you.
I've only… I've only been at Angellotti a year now…
You know what, man? Forget I asked. Don't worry about it. Seriously.
-It's-- I was stupid. I got carried away. -No, le… let me finish.
What I was gonna say was…
I've been waiting years to be in a position -to be able to help you out, and now I am. -[sentimental music playing]
It's not gonna be an easy sell, but um,
I think I can get you in a room with Angellotti himself. [chuckles]
-[Ollie] Thank you so much. -Of course.
You know, you're a lot more affectionate than I remember.
Uh, it's just-- I miss it so much, you know?
It's the only thing I was ever any good at.
-[scoffs] -[Ollie] Oh, this is great. I can move back here.
I can put Gertie in a really good, expensive private school. I can…
I can get her a nanny, you know?
It'll be like that whole Fresh Prince thing never even happened.
Well, I'll… I'll work on the old man when I get back to the office and I'll call you tonight if it's a go.
Oh, great.

I'll be doing my own singing henceforth.
-Who's Tommy Tune? -[Ollie] Tommy Tune is a man
that you can get a chance to see live and on Broadway
when we move back to New York City!
-What? -What?
-What? -What?
Yeah, what?
Well, I was just on the phone with an old friend of mine that I used to work with at Mandell Kirschner.
Anyway, I had lunch with him, and I asked him if he'd get me an interview with his new firm, right?
Jesus, another interview, Ollie? Come on, when are you gonna learn?
Well, smart guy, he just called me, said he sat down with his boss,
sold me to his boss like I was the cure for cancer.
And It just so happens that a little spot has opened up in their music department.
Boom! After six years of being a pariah, I'm gonna get back in!
I'm talking about no more street sweeper,
no more picking up garbage, and no more water main.
I'm talking press lines, I'm talking about parties.
I'm talking about a Westside address.
I'm talking about a good school for Gertie.
But I already go to a good school.
Yes, honey, but you're gonna go to a way, way better school in New York City.
You're gonna be able to take the subway to school. Won't that be fun?
But the subway's full of junkies and mole-men.
Well, they are. Don't listen to Pop. What do I tell you? He makes things up.
Don't listen to Pop. What do I tell you? He makes things up.
-You'll see. The subways are great. -I don't wanna see.
I don't wanna go to a school up in the city. I wanna go to my school.
Honey, It's gonna be too far of a drive for me to come back down here
to take you to school in New Jersey every morning.
So let's not move to the city. Let's stay here with Pop.
Sweetheart, I'm too old… [chuckles] …to be living with my father.
I need to get my own place.
And Pop, I mean, look at him, he's a mad-dog.
He doesn't want us around here, getting in his way, cramping his style.
Do you, Pop?
That's all horseshit.
You know, thanks, Pop.
I don't wanna move to the city. I like it here.
Pop says you can live here as long as you want.
Baby, remember when I took you to see Sweeney Todd?
How much fun was that? We had a good time, right?
I mean… if we move to New York City, we can do that every night.
Except for the nights you're working, of course.
You know what? Why don't you shut up for a second, okay?
I'm trying to talk to my daughter.
You love New York City. You told me you loved the city.
-No, I didn't. -[sighs]
-[Gertie] I said it was okay. -Jesus Christ!
-[Gertie] I said I like Highlands better. -[Bart] Yeah. [Gertie] Why would you want some other job anyway, Dad?
You get to ride the Batmobile.
Baby, Daddy doesn't wanna drive the Batmobile!
Daddy wants to eat sushi. Daddy wants to hail cabs.
Daddy wants to have a doorman.
Daddy wants to lord it over magazine editors.
Daddy loved his old job, and he's missed it every day since he's been gone.
[inhales sharply] Daddy wants to do that job. Daddy doesn't wanna pick up garbage for the rest of his life!
But you told everybody at the meeting that your job's good
because you don't have to wear a suit.
Yes, but Daddy was just saying that to get them to say yes to a water main.
So you were just lying to everybody?
Look, okay, I'll tell you what. I'll go to the meeting, all right?
If I don't like what the man says, then I won't take the job.
Now you're lying to me!
All right, look, young lady! I'm gonna go to this job interview on Monday
whether you like it or not.
-Wait, this Monday? -Yes.
-Wait, this Monday? -Yes. -Ollie, you can't go on Monday. -Why?
-Ollie, you can't go on Monday. -Why? Because that's the day of my show!
Oh, shit.
It is, isn't it?
Well, it's at 4:00, so I can, you know, I can just skip-- make it back in time.
But my show's at 5:00.
On what planet are you gonna get back here by 5:00
if you've got a meeting in the city at 4:00?
Just lay off me for a second! I forgot about the show.
How could you forget? What are you, stupid?
Gertie, this job is very important to Daddy.
What about my show? Isn't that important to you?
Yes, honey, that's even more important to me.
Then don't go to your stupid meeting about your stupid new job in the stupid city.
All right that's enough, young lady. You know what? I don't want you in the show anymore.
You're not even a good Sweeney Todd anyway.
Pop's way better. Even Uncle Greenie and Uncle Block are better than you.
Those men are not your uncles!
Oh, no, but we're good enough to build sets for her show, I got it.
Sorry, I didn't mean that. Where are you going?
I don't wanna be around you. I don't want you to come to the show to watch it either.
Oh, come on! I don't! You're not allowed to come 'cause I don't even like you anymore!
Get back here, young lady. Hey! I'm talking to you!
Hey, young lady? Get back here, young lady.
No! You can't tell me what to do. I don't have to do anything you say!
-Yes, you do. -Why?
-Because I'm your father, that's why! -So what?
-Because I'm your father, that's why! -So what? Don't you yell at me, Gertrude.
I'll yell at you all I want! Blah! Blah! Blah!
I'll yell at you all I want! Blah! Blah! Blah! -I'm not moving to the stupid city! -All right, that's it.
-I'm not moving to the stupid city! -All right, that's it. You are moving to the city and you're gonna like it, and that's the end!
I hate you! I hate you! I wish you'd died, not Mommy!
I hate you right back, you little shit!
You and your mother took my life away, and I just want it back!
God, I'm sorry, I'm sorry sweetheart. I didn't mean…
-Get off me! Get off of me! -I'm sorry…
-[sighs] -What the hell's the matter with you?
♪ Well, I've been afraid of changing ♪
♪ 'Cause I've built my life around you ♪
-Hey. -Hey.
What happened to you the other night? You just sort of took off.
lt looked to me like you guys needed a little privacy.
What I really needed was a little backup.
She's a kid, Ollie. Kids don't weather change well.
I mean, in a few years, you won't be able to keep her out of Manhattan.
But for now, she just wants what she knows.
So do I.
Yeah, but is that even what you know anymore?
Oh, Jesus. You too?
You want your old life back. I get it. Big-money job, out of your old man's house.
It's not like it doesn't make any sense.
Yeah. So?
That's your life that you want back, not theirs.
I mean, this is their life. What you're sort of saying to everybody who loves you
is that what we have isn't good enough for you.
So it's just upsetting everybody, you know?
-Everybody? -Oh. What, me? [chuckles]
I mean, it's not like we've got some big romance… [chuckles] …going on or anything. We're just friends, right?
[chuckles] …going on or anything. We're just friends, right?
Did you ever wonder if, uh, maybe someday it might…
be more than that?
For about two seconds, before you had me hiding in the shower from your kid. [chuckles]
Look, Ollie, I like you, but… I'm not gonna be all heartbroken 'cause you're leaving town.
but… I'm not gonna be all heartbroken 'cause you're leaving town.
I know.
Even if I took this job in the city,
I'd still come back down here and visit my old man.
And you.
Why? I mean, you think I'm gonna stick around here for much longer?
Maya… Ollie…
I gotta get back to work.
If, uh… if I don't… If I don't see you at the show,
give me a call sometime when you get all settled up in the big city.
Come on.
[sighs] Shit.
Hi, Daddy.
Hey, baby. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up.
It's okay.
Listen. I'm sorry for yelling at you the other night.
I was wrong. And I didn't mean any of the things that I said.
I know. Neither did I.
Daddy? Yeah?
Did Mommy like living in the city?
Yeah, she did. She loved it.
Then I guess I'll love it too.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Thanks.
You know, I still might make it to your show tomorrow, if the traffic's not too bad.
I won't be mad if you miss it. I understand.
Okay, sweetie. Go back to sleep. I love you.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night.
George Clooney's office for Tony on line one.
The Angellotti Company. One moment, please.
-Can I help you? -Yes. Uh, my name's Oliver Trinke,
-Can I help you? -Yes. Uh, my name's Oliver Trinke, and I'm here to see Arthur Brickman, uh, and Mr. Angellotti.
Okay. Mr. Trinke is here.
Okay, I will.
Uh, they're gonna be about ten more minutes.
[click tongue] Okay.
You can have a seat. [chuckles] Right. Right.
[man] Hello.
Oh, my God. Hi! [gasps, chuckles]
[man] Uh, I'm here to see Brad.
Yes. He's expecting you, sir.
He apologizes, but he's stuck in traffic. He's just a few blocks away,
so why don't you just have a seat and I'll… I'll let him know that you've arrived.
[man] Well, thank you very much.
They love to keep you waiting, don't they?
Excuse me? Oh, no, I was saying they… they love to keep you waiting.
Right. Yeah. Yeah, they do.
I think they think it gives them the psychological edge, you know?
Well, it's about to give them the edge of my ass,
'cause that's all they're gonna see when I'm walking out that door.
You know anything about these guys?
Uh, only that they're the fastest-growing--
"Growing firm in the business." Yes, I read that article too.
All right, well, you know as much as I do.
I guess that means they know what they're doing.
I suppose. Unless these publicists hire other publicists -to get the word out for them. -[Will] Right.
-to get the word out for them. -[Will] Right. Yeah, and then those publicists hire their own publicists
to help spin the good publicity they created for these publicists.
Of course, you know, knowing publicists, they probably hire publicists
to promote the fact that they spun the publicity
that they hired the other publicists to spin.
-Oh, man! So what do you do? -I'm a publicist.
I didn't realize I was sitting here talking to an Angellotti man.
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm… I'm not an Angellotti man.
At least not yet. I'm here trying to get a job, so…
Yeah, well, you know, these guys have been trying to steal me from my publicist ever since my last flick came out.
Oh, the… the robot movie, right? Oh, yeah. You saw it?
I haven't gotten around to it yet. I'm gonna… I'm gonna…
Oh, yeah. Thanks a lot for the support, though, man.
-I wan… I wanna see it… -You know what? It's not that good. -It's not that good. -[laughs]
I have a kid. I don't get a chance to get out and see movies
unless they have singing crabs in them or something.
Singing crabs. I saw that one. That means you have a girl.
-That's right. That's right. -[chuckles]
-How old is she? -Uh, she's seven.
Yeah, cool. I got a girl and two boys.
Three kids?
God. How do you find time to make all those blockbusters?
Shoot, if I didn't have all them kids,
I wouldn't have to make these blockbusters.
-[chuckles] -Right.
Oh, man.
It's cool, though, isn't it? Making blockbusters? You tell me.
Making blockbusters? You tell me. Being a parent, funny man.
It has its moments.
-What's your daughter's name? -Uh, Gertrude.
[click tongue] Damn! Why'd you do that to that girl, man?
-[laughs] -Did you lose a bet? No. No, it was my wife's name.
No. No, it was my wife's name. "Was"? Your wife-- Okay, let me guess. She took you for half
"Was"? Your wife-- Okay, let me guess. She took you for half after she saddled the kid with the name "Gert."
[chuckles] I can't blame it on her. I saddled the kid with the name "Gert."
She… she died at childbirth, so…
-Oh… -No, no, no, it's… I just-- I feel like an asshole, man.
Oh, no, no. Don't worry about it. You didn't know. No, listen, I'm… I'm really sorry about that.
No, listen, I'm… I'm really sorry about that. I didn't see your movie, so we're even. Trust me.
You know, this is exactly why people don't talk to each other when they sitting in waiting rooms, right?
Probably. Although, I gotta tell ya, the simple fact that the guy who wrote
Although, I gotta tell ya, the simple fact that the guy who wrote Parents Just Don't Understand is now a parent himself,
-I think completely makes up for it. -[both laugh]
Oh, man. We don't, though, do we?
-What's that? -Understand.
I mean, these kids today, from the door, man, they got it all over us.
My daughter has it all over me, I can tell you that.
-Yeah, my middle one, my son? -Mm-hmm.
Every time I walk out of the house in the morning,
he says, "Daddy, how far you love me?"
I always pick somewhere close, and be like, "I love you to that table, man."
"I know, you don't." "You love me all the way to the moon and back down to the dirt."
-[chuckles] -That's great.
It takes everything I got to walk out of the house.
You get to spend time with them on the set, though, right?
[Will] Oh, yeah. But if I was a smart man, I wouldn't be sittin' here right now.
I'd be at home playing in the dirt with my kids.
But we all know that I'm not famous 'cause of my brains.
It's 'cause I'm, like, strikingly handsome, crazy sexy.
And I'm, like, hung like it's ridiculous. [laughs]
Oh, man! But I'm definitely not the sharpest spoon in the shed.
You know…
it was really nice talking to you. Oh, hey. You, too, man. You out?
Oh, hey. You, too, man. You out? -I'm out. -All right.
Hey, you, uh, recommend these guys?
Uh… only guy I can recommend is named Arthur Brickman.
Other than that, I can't vouch for anybody.
Whoa, whoa, hold up. -You Brickman? -[chuckles] No.
-You Brickman? -[chuckles] No. I'm just a guy who'd rather play in the dirt with his kid.

I worked for the Umbrella Corporation...
...the largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world.
I was head of security...
...at a secret high-tech facility called The Hive...
...a giant underground laboratory developing experimental...
...viral weaponry.
But there was an incident.
The virus escaped and everybody died.
Trouble was...
...they didn't stay dead.
The T-virus reanimated their bodies.
But I survived. Myself and one other...
...an environmentalist named Matt.
When we emerged, we were seized by Umbrella scientists.
Matt and I were separated.
He's mutating. I want him in the Nemesis Program.
Matt!
Take her to the Raccoon City facility...
...and assemble the team.
We're reopening The Hive.
I want to know what went on down there.
We thought we'd survived the horror.
But we were wrong.
You're watching Raccoon 7. Now the weather, with Terri Morales.
It's 6:10 in the a.m. and already the temperature has reached...
...a massive 92 degrees as this unprecedented heat wave continues.
Clear skies in Raccoon City and a light breeze coming in from the west.
And as a special bonus just for you, we have a pollen count of 0.7.
That's a record low for this time of year.
Good news for all you hay fever and asthma sufferers.
All in all, it looks like it's gonna be another beautiful day.
Stay with us. After the break...
...we're gonna look at your favorite holiday hot spots.
Advance team, proceed.
Sir.
Holy shit.
Excuse us, ma'am. There's been an incident.
Excuse us, sir. There's been an incident.
How bad is it?
-You must come with us. -I must get my daughter.
-It's taken care of. -What are you doing?
You don't understand. She's left for school.
This is U-Gamma 7, evacuation complete...
...but we just lost contact with Gamma 12.
Unit 12 calling for immediate backup at city hall.
Still no explanation for this wave of unexplained killings...
...that is sweeping across the city.
A deadly crime spree with no end.
Backup, we need backup now!
Just like Valentine told us....
Off-duty law enforcement personnel, report for duty immediately.
Give us a hand over here, this guy's insane!
-It's Valentine. -Hold your fire.
-Valentine! -They're infected.
Somebody get this ugly bitch off of me!
I told you. Shoot for the head.
Please, somebody get her.
No! Don't shoot! Don't--
I'm leaving town. I suggest you do the same.
Everyone's leaving the city.
We've received reports of Umbrella Corporation...
We've received reports of Umbrella Corporation... ...dispatching armed guards and troop carriers.
Move in an orderly fashion to security checkpoints.
The city is completely contained. Troops have sealed all exits.
The only way out is this bridge.
All citizens must pass through medical scanning.
Sir! You better take a look at this.
Family members must pass through security checkpoints together.
Please proceed in an orderly fashion. Do not run.
-He's clean. Let him pass. -Next!
No pushing, please. Keep in line.
Can we get some reinforcements down here?
Chopper Delta, new orders.
Proceed directly to Ravens Gate Bridge.
Reinforcements urgently needed.
Copy that, base. On our way.
Get it.
No! Get off!
Get away! No! Stop! Get off!
No! Get back!
Civilian in trouble. Three o'clock. Go down.
I can't. We have our orders.
No! Get back! No!
They're gonna kill her! Take us down now!
She's a civilian. We have orders.
Fuck orders!
Nicholai, tie me off.
Get back! No!
Wait!
Now!
Take us down! Down, now!
Hey. Hey, you okay?
Step away from the edge. Come over to me.
-Everything's okay. -No, it's not.
I've seen what happens to you once you've been bitten.
-We can help you. -There's no going back.
No!
Move! Peyton!
-Peyton! -Valentine. Hey, Valentine.
-Move! Police! Move! -Let her through.
Glad you're here. We could use the help.
-He has a weak heart. -Get away from him!
Everybody, stand back!
-Daddy! -Get away from him!
-Get her away from him! -It's okay.
-Get her away! -It's okay. Come on.
-Daddy! -It's okay, I got you.
-Get him off! Get him off me! -Move aside!
Get back!
It's here. It's reached the gate.
Why are you here? You should've got out while you had the chance.
These are our people, Jill.
-Close them. -Sir?
Seal the gates.
-Our men are still out there-- -Just do it.
Oh, my God, they're closing the gates!
This is a biohazard quarantine area.
Due to risk of infection, you cannot be allowed to leave the city.
What the fuck is going on here?
All appropriate measures are being taken.
The situation is under control.
Please return to your homes.
You won't get away with this!
Let us out!
You have five seconds to turn around...
...and return to the city.
Do it.
Use of live ammunition has been authorized.
Five.
-They can't shoot people! -They won't fire.
Three.
-Get them back! -Two.
-Move! -One.
Everybody, clear out!
Kilo and Romeo squads, rendezvous at sector 01...
...and secure against enemy.
-Grenade! -Grenade!
Squads three to seven are on full retreat.
No, sir. Suppression measures have failed. We can't contain it.
The infection is spreading faster than anyone anticipated.
Dr. Ashford.
-Shouldn't you be on the chopper? -I'm not going.
I was instructed to get you and the other scientists out of the hot zone.
You're too important to Umbrella to be at risk.
I'm not leaving without my daughter.
I'm sorry, truly. But the city is sealed.
She may have survived the crash, but we couldn't find her anywhere.
Even if she were still alive, I couldn't let her out.
The risk of infection is too great. You must understand.
You do what you have to do.
I'm staying.
There has to be someone left alive.
Come on.
-Matt! -Take her to the Raccoon City facility.
I want her quarantined. Close observation.
Prepare her for exposure.
Up the dosage.
Just do it.
Inside.
Let's get under cover.
You have to get out.
This is my place. I'm hiding here.
-It's big enough for all of us. -Don't tell me--
Okay, just cool it. Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.
And, you, take it easy.
So does the Raccoon City Police Department...
...have any comment on what those things are?
What's that you got there?
My Emmy.
That's if any of us make it out.
Are you all right?
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
It's my sister. She's not well.
-Maybe I can help. -No.
Out of my way.
Just get out.
You're feeding her? You're sick.
Just leave us alone.
No!
-I'm getting out of here. -Hey.
Hey! Hey, no!
Oh, my God!
Hey, help us! Come on!
Get it in there!
What the hell was that?
There!
Jesus.
-What the fuck is that thing? -What are you doing?
Get back here.
Peyton. Terri.
Peyton.
I know.
I count three of them.
They got us boxed in.
What are we gonna do?
Let's go.
Jesus.
We're gonna need more ammo. I'm out.
Shit. I'm out.
Move.
Who the fuck are you?
GTA, motherfucker!
Oh, yeah!
Ten points!
Yuri. You okay?
Bite this.
-You okay? -Yeah. Yeah.
Pull back!
This way.
This is Olivera. We've been overrun. Request immediate chopper evac.
We need to find somewhere to stop for a moment.
I don't think that's a good idea.
There might be more of those...
...things.
If there were more, we'd have seen them by now.
-You know what they are? -They're bio-weapons...
...from Umbrella labs beneath the city.
How come you know so much about Umbrella?
I used to work for them.
Damn it.
Hold it.
What do you think you're doing?
He's wounded. The infection's spreading.
I'm fine.
You should take care of him now.
It'll be more difficult later.
You know that.
No.
If it comes to that...
...I'll take care of it myself.
As you wish.
It's nothing personal. But in an hour, maybe two...
...you'll be dead.
And moments later, you'll become one of them.
You'll endanger your friends, try to kill them...
...probably succeed.
I'm sorry. That's just the way it is.
Help me!
There's too many of them.
Let's get out of here. This way!
Sir, T-virus infection has reached critical levels.
This is a perfect opportunity.
Ensure all data streams are recorded.
Activate Nemesis Program now.
-Hey! -Here! We're down here!
-Hey! -Come! We're here!
-Where are they going? -They're landing there. Let's get Yuri!
-Come on, Yuri. We're getting out. -We'll get you fixed up. Come.
Hold on, Yuri. We're almost there.
No. No! Don't leave!
-Down here! We're coming! -They dropped something.
Maybe a radio. One that works.
Take Yuri.
Hold on, Yuri.
Nicholai, put me down.
Okay, rest here.
What is this?
Looks like weapon cases.
We don't need weapons. We need evacuation!
These weren't meant for us.
Yuri!
Plenty to go around.
Don't shoot!
I got the power.
Thank you! Owe you one, man.
Shit!
Maybe I was safer outside.
Get them guns out of my damn face.
Motherfucker, please. Look...
...my shit is custom.
What the fuck is that?
Shit!
You're going down, you son of a bitch!
Fuck.
Deploy defensive formation. Take him down.
You fuckers is crazy. Look at that guy, got a rocket launcher.
-What do we have? -A dozen armed men. Well organized.
-I'm surprised there's anyone left. -They're S.T.A.R.S.
Special Tactics and Rescue Squad. They're the best.
Fire!
Back! Fall back!
-Let's see how good they really are. -Altering protocols.
S.T.A.R.S.
Oh, shit.
Respect.
Those were some pretty slick moves back there.
I'm good...
...but I'm not that good.
-You should be thankful for that. -What do you mean?
They did something to me. I barely feel human anymore.
We should keep moving. Before the sound attracts anything.
Keep moving.
-Hello? -God, I thought you'd never answer.
-Who is this? -I can get you out of the city.
All four of you.
But first we have to come to an arrangement.
Are you ready to make a deal?
-Do we have a choice? -Not if you want to live past tonight, no.
His name is Dr. Ashford and he--
Runs the genetics and viral research division of Umbrella Corporation.
What's he want with us?
His daughter, Angela, is trapped in the city.
Umbrella was to evac her, but she didn't make it.
She's hiding out in her school.
We find her, he'll help us escape the perimeter.
No fucking deal.
We find the building with the thickest walls and doors...
...and we barricade ourselves in. Sit tight, wait for help.
There won't be any help.
Umbrella knows they can't contain the infection.
So at sunrise this morning, Raccoon City will be completely sanitized.
What do you mean by "sanitized"?
A precision tactical nuclear device.
-What yield? -Five kilotons.
-Fuck me. -Stupid.
-What does that mean? -It means it'll destroy the infection...
...and all evidence of it.
It's bullshit. It's bullshit!
No fucking way would they get away with that!
-It would be all over the fucking news! -Cover-up.
Cover-up's already prepared.
A meltdown at the nuclear power plant.
-A tragic accident. -Not even Umbrella is capable of this.
Not capable?
Peyton, you were there at the bridge.
You know exactly how far Umbrella will go.
So, what do we do now, huh?
I think we should be out of here by sunrise.
What if there is no way out and he's watching us on these cameras...
...like this is some kind of sick game?
-What is it? -What's going on?
-Wait. -Sunrise ain't gonna wait.
No.
-There's something down there. -Where?
There.
I don't see anything.
That doesn't alter the fact that there is something down there.
I'm getting sick of this bullshit!
Peyton!
No!
He's located another two S.T.A.R.S. members.
Nemesis.
Run. Just go!
Primary target is identified.
Gentlemen, this is what we've been waiting for.
Confirm at 2:18 and 27 seconds.
The Nemesis Program is now fully activated.
Look, I'm-- I'm sorry about your friend.
Let's just get to the school and find this kid.
This bite...
...it won't stop bleeding.
-Why didn't they see us? -What?
The chopper. We were right there in the street in front of the hospital.
-How could they not see us? -They saw us.
What do you mean?
We're assets, Nicholai.
Expendable assets.
And we've just been expended.
Stop!
I'm not one of those things.
Hey, remember me? Look, I haven't been bitten or anything. Look.
Climb aboard.
Lloyd Jefferson Wade.
You can call me L.J. on account of the informal situation.
We're gonna have to split up to search this place.
Forget it. Forget it! I'm not going out there by myself.
I can go with you.
You, take the first floor.
You, take the second.
I'll take the basement.
-I've never shot a gun before. -There's nothing to it.
Try to hit them in the head.
I see you, mother--
Oh, shit!
So did you get the call as well?
-What? -You're here for the girl?
Oh, yeah, yeah. The girl.
Dr. Ashford didn't say he made a deal with someone else.
I guess we're partners.
Shit.
Angela?
It's gonna be okay.
There's no need to be afraid.
We're gonna take you home.
Oh, my God.
Help me!
Terri?
You can't help her.
Not now.
I've seen what they do.
-Are you Angela? -Yes.
We should hurry before they come back.
Hold this.
Angela Ashford, huh?
That's a pretty grown-up name for a little girl.
I'm not a little girl.
Besides...
-...all my friends call me Angie. -Angie, huh?
I like that.
Those things are in here.
It's okay, honey. They're slow. We can run around them.
No. Not them.
Them.
Get back.
Stay.
Thought you might need a hand.
-You work for Umbrella? -Used to.
Until they left us for dead in this place. Now I consider myself freelance.
Sergeant Nicholai Genovev, at your service.
-Come on! -Wait! Angie!
Save the girl! I've got this bitch.
Oh, shit.
From now on, stay right beside me.
It's blocked.
What do we do now?
Wait here. Eyes:
Okay?
Thank you.
You two know each other?
She's infected.
She's infected on a massive level.
-How can you know that? -Because she is too.
You're infected? When were you gonna tell us that?
-Let me see. -No.
You know I'm not gonna hurt you.
Let me see.
It's the antivirus, the cure to the T-virus.
There's a cure?
How did you get this?
My daddy. My daddy made it for me.
He's sick. And someday, I'll get sick too.
He just wanted to stop that.
When I was little...
...I had to walk on crutches.
They said I'd never get better, just worse.
He found a way to make me stronger.
The T-virus.
Then they took the invention away from him.
Get out of my house!
He's not a bad man.
He didn't mean for any of this.
It's okay.
Don't shoot! He's cool.
He made a deal with Dr. Doom, same as you.
How many of you guys are there?
What do you mean?
Nicholai.
When were you bitten?
-Three hours ago. -What the--?
It's your lucky day.
Should have told me you got bit. I'm hanging with you and shit.
-Let me speak to my daughter. -First, you tell us how we're getting out.
There's a helicopter already being prepped.
It takes off in 47 minutes.
It'll be the last transport to leave Raccoon City before they detonate.
I take it this helicopter isn't laid out just for us.
No. It has another purpose, but it'll be lightly guarded.
-Where's the evac site? -May I speak to my daughter now?
-Daddy? -Hey, sweetheart.
-Are you all right? -When can I see you?
Soon. These people will bring you to see me.
I'll see you very soon.
Put the lady back on.
Where do we have to go?
The helicopter will be at city hall.
I suggest you make haste.
Computers...
...so unreliable.
Just like people.
You really thought I didn't know?
So, what are you injecting me with?
The antivirus.
The T-virus reanimates dead cells.
Basically, bringing the dead to life.
Or in a living human, it can cause uncontrollable mutation.
Or it can help her walk again, if the virus is kept in check with this.
-Angie's infected? -Yes.
The cellular growth is enough to regenerate her...
...but not enough to cause mutation.
And they infected you with the T-virus as well?
Yeah.
But don't worry. I'm not contagious.
Here.
Tape the story. I'll see that it gets put to good use.
My name is Alice.
I worked for the Umbrella Corporation...
...the largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world.
I was head of security at a secret high-tech facility called The Hive...
...a giant underground laboratory developing experimental...
...viral weaponry.
Let's go.
You missed one.
We have to hurry.
-We're okay. We have time. -No! We have to hurry.
-Holy shit! We stealing his ride! -Take off.
-I said, take off! -What's the rush?
We've been expecting you.
-Perimeter secure. -All sectors locked down.
-Angie! -Daddy!
-I knew you wouldn't leave me. -No. Never.
Discard primary weaponry.
The two of you showed such promise, but we had to see you in action.
And most impressive you've been.
You're like brother and sister.
Heightened speed, strength, agility, the same killer instincts.
Parallel strands of research.
And now.... Now we'll discover which is superior.
Fight him.
No.
Fight him, or they die.
What makes you think I care?
Daddy! Daddy, no.
No.
He was a valuable asset to the corporation.
I don't even care about these people.
Begin.
He's mutating. I want him in the Nemesis Program.
Matt!
Cellular structure breaking down.
T-virus is manifesting itself in a genetic mutation.
We're seeing similar cellular regeneration.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Matt. I'm so sorry.
Finish him.
I said, finish him.
No.
No.
Don't you understand how important you are to me?
That creature is one thing, but you...
...somehow you bonded with the T-virus on a cellular level.
You adapted it, changed it. You became magnificent.
-I became a freak. -No.
You're not mutation. You're evolution.
With my help, just imagine what you can achieve.
What about him?
Evolution has its dead ends.
Now, finish this. Put him out of his misery...
...and come with me.
No.
You're such a disappointment to me.
All that strength...
...but no will to use it.
What a waste.
Prepare for takeoff.
Sanitation of Raccoon City to commence on my mark.
Kill her.
What are you doing?
Get us airborne.
This is Cain. Priority overload. Initiate launch proceedings.
Detonation set at T-minus 5 minutes.
Angie, get down!
Why haven't we taken off?
Because I usually drive a Cadillac.
Surrender, or we open fire.
Drop it.
Alice!
Drop your weapon and surrender.
Let's get this thing in the air!
You have to get up.
Matt....
Come on, we have to go. We have to go. Come on.
Come on.
Get up!
If you expect me to beg, I will not.
Wait.
Killing me won't put things right.
No...
...but it's a start.
Are you going to be all right?
Hang on to something!
We're going down!
U-Gamma 9 to base. Confirmation.
We've located the crash site.
Fetch the medical team.
What about the others?
No other bodies found, sir.
We have unconfirmed reports of disaster at Raccoon City.
These shocking images just in.
A mysterious plague or viral outbreak has run rampant--
Implicating Umbrella Corporation in deaths of innocent citizens.
This tape, work of former Raccoon 7 anchorwoman Terri Morales.
New evidence now discredits earlier reports--
-Nothing more than sick joke. -Fake videotape totally discredited.
Nothing more than a big hoax.
Playing on the very real tragedy...
...which overwhelmed Raccoon City this week.
The reactor at the nuclear power station went critical.
The worst atomic disaster since the Russian Chernobyl incident in 1986.
The state governor personally thanked the Umbrella Corporation...
...for their swift action.
The perpetrators of the hoax, Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera...
...now being sought for questioning by the police.
Alice.
Alice, wake up.
Can you hear me?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Good.
Begin the purging process.
Her recovery's remarkable.
And her powers, both physical and mental...
...are developing at a geometric rate.
Where are you?
You're safe.
Come on.
That's it.
There we are.
Do you know what that is?
It's a pen.
You see?
You try.
That's it.
Pen.
Look at me.
Can you remember anything?
You remember your name?
My name?
My name.
I want her under 24-hour observation.
A complete set of blood work.
Chemical and electrolyte analysis by the end of the day.
My name.
-My name. -Sir.
Advanced reflex testing is a priority.
My name.
-Monitor electrical impulses-- -Sir.
Sir!
What is it?
My name...
...is Alice.
And I remember everything.
This is central. Request immediate backup.
Maximum response.
Thank you, gentlemen. We'll take over from here.
-On whose authority? -Classified. Level six authorization.
Sorry, sir.
Let them go.
Good to have you back.
Are you all right?
Program Alice activated.
What did they do to you?
This is a product of the Umbrella Corporation.
He ruled a large and mighty kingdom. Yet he was sad, -
- for he was growing old, and had no child to inherit the throne.
Then, happily, a daughter was born. A princess.
And she was given the name Odette.
Kings and queens came from all around to offer gifts.
Among them was the widow Uberta and her son, Prince Derek.
Then William and Uberta happened upon the same idea:
If the children spent each summer together they might fall in love, -
- and join their kingdoms forever.
But unknown to all was the plan of the evil enchanter, Rothbart.
Odette's birth was of little concern to him.
He was preparing to take William's kingdom using the forbidden arts.
On the eve of his assault William attacked, -
- and Rothbart's powers were plunged into darkness.
Despite calls for his death, the enchanter was only banished.
I'm not finished with you yet. Someday I'll get my power back.
And then everything you own, and everything you love, will be mine!
Many feared King William was too kind.
But in time, the threat was forgotten.
All hopes turned to that summer -
- when Derek and Odette would meet.
Here they come!
Dear Uberta! As lovely as ever!
A nest!
And who might this young man be? Young Prince Derek, no doubt.
Welcome to our fair kingdom.
And to you, young princess.
Go on, Derek dear! Go on ... Derek!
Hello, Princess Odette. I'm very pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you, Prince Derek!
now I'm stuck with her all summer she can't wrestle, hunt or box
- he's conceited - what a total bummer
- I'll be lucky to get chickenpox - so happy you could come
- so happy to be here - how I'd like to run!
this is not my idea of fun
they seem to get along nicely
we'll join our lands if this clicks
that's my point precisely
- good parenting - and politics
- so happy we agree - I think it's a deal
- Derek's quite a catch - this is my idea of a match
And such fun.
good heavens, child, don't dawdle we can't keep Derek waiting
I haven't packed and Father, I get seasick
they soon will be arriving is that respect you're showing?
if I have to kiss her hand again I'm gonna be sick
one day Prince Derek will be her intended
splendid!
we tried all summer but we can't lose her
- Wait up! - Quick!
when picking teams I'd never choose her
can't she read?
- this isn't fair - we don't care
- It's all or none - this is not my idea of fun
long before they met Derek and Odette
were destined to be wedded
- however anyone could see - the only thing they could agree
was that the very thought of summer was dreaded
she tries to make me dress up she flirts with the castle guards
- don't you really sort of like her? - only if she'd lose at cards
- four sevens and a ten - I win again
every time she's won
- this is my idea of fun - this isn't my idea of fun
we need a royal wedding I'd love to be invited
at least we'd get a holiday to rest our plows and axes
someday these two will marry two lands will be united
and with luck their marriage may result in lower taxes
- what if she dislikes the merger? - urge her
for as long as I remember we've been told we'd someday wed
every June until September
- all their annoying hints - bruises from their fingerprints
- I could do better, I'm sure - he's so immature
I see him smiling and my knees start buckling
I see inside him and my doubts are gone
she started out as such an ugly duckling
and somehow suddenly became a swan
- so happy to be here - till now I never knew
it is you I've been dreaming of
- this is my idea ... - this is my idea ...
what a good idea such a romantic notion
this is my idea, such a good idea such a powerful and magic potion
this is exactly my idea
this is exactly my idea of love
this is my idea ...
this is my idea ...
this is my idea
this is my idea of love .
Arrange the marriage!
Wait!
What? You're all I ever wanted. You're beautiful.
- Thank you. But what else? - What else?
Is beauty all that matters to you?
- Derek? What else? - I ... uh ...
What else is there?
We tried, Uberta. No one can say we didn't try.
- Say goodbye, Odette. - Goodbye ... Prince Derek.
Mother! Goodbye, Princess.
All these years of planning ... wasted!
She says, "Is beauty all that matters?"
- And you say, "What else is there?" - It was dumb, I know.
You should write a book: "How to Offend Women."
- Your turn, Prince Derek. - I didn't know what else to say.
- You lost your queen. - That's twice today.
Think! You must see more than her beauty.
I do, Rogers. She's like ...
... you know ... and how about ...
I mean, right?
I don't know how to say it.
I'll prove it to her. I'll prove my love. Checkmate!
Today's the day.
Everything you own, everything you love, will be mine!
I just don't understand. What else did you want him to say?
I need to know that he loves me for myself.
Stay inside, Odette.
- It's King William's captain. - We ...
We were attacked ... A great animal.
- Odette! - Derek, wait!
Odette! Odette?
Odette?
King William ... Who did this?
- It was so quick. A great animal. - Where is Odette?
Listen to me, Derek. It's not what it seems.
- What's not? Where is Odette? - Odette is ...
Odette is ... gone.
Odette!
Don't let my spell make you sad, it doesn't even last the whole day.
As soon as the moon comes up ...
That's how it works every night.
When the moonlight on the lake touches your wings ...
This doesn't give me any pleasure. Well, maybe a teensy bit ...
But what I really want is your father's kingdom.
- Take it then. You have the power. - I've tried that.
When you steal something, you have to fight to keep it.
But if I married the only heir to the throne ...
... we'll rule your father's kingdom together, legally. King and queen.
- Never! - Where are you going?
As soon as the moonlight leaves the lake, you turn back into a swan.
- The musicians are not happy. - I know, but I have to practice.
I'm sure it'll be loads of ... fun.
- That animal won't give up easily. - You don't think she's alive?
- When I find it, I'll find Odette. - But you've looked everywhere.
- All the kingdom knows she's gone. - All the kingdom is wrong.
She's alive, and I will find her. Ready, Brom?
No peeking. Animals, assemble!
I must object! We are musicians.
Well, the servants are off today.
- But I'm an artist, not a boar! - You could have fooled me.
Come on, guys. They're harmless.
we are a band not a band of animals
this masquerade is more than I can bear
there goes my reputation such awful humiliation
and I've the lion's share
Down on all fours, and growl ferociously!
Liven it up a bit!
I want you to strike fear into my heart!
Not you, Wesley. You're a rabbit, for heaven's sake.
Archers! Ready!
Set.
Go!
- Duck! - Yes?
- Duck! - What?
Day after day, all he ever does
is practice, practice, practice
thinking of her and the way it was
practice, practice, practice
he's not happy till he has attacked us
day after day all he ever does is practice
thinking of her and the way it was practice, practice, practice
if we'd refused he'd have sacked us practice, practice, practice .
Time! Animals, assemble for counting.
You scored plenty of five-pointers, that's for sure!
Sorry, Hans.
Moose are worth two points. 16 hits ... a total of 32.
Ten seven-pointers and fourteen three-pointers!
Ten seven-pointers and fourteen three-pointers! A total of 298! Well done, Derek! And for you, Bromley ...
A total of 298! Well done, Derek! And for you, Bromley ... Zero ... and zero ... and nothing and nil and zip.
Last but not least, the elusive 100-point white rabbit ...
- I believe that's 300, Rogers. - Good shooting, Brom!
Well? Write it down. 300 to 298.
Wait just a moment, Rogers.
- Sorry, Brom! - You're a great marksman, Derek.
But it takes more than that. It takes courage. That's my forte.
How about a quick round of "Catch and Fire."
C ... c ... catch and fire? You mean me?
You're the only one with enough c ... c ... courage.
- Are you sure you're all right? - Yes, I'm fine.
- Too tight! - Oops! So sorry!
Ready?
He's ready.
Remember, aim for the heart. Right between the shoulders.
Oh, please!
Come on, Brom. Hold it steady.
Oh please ...
Now!
52 out of 52. Well done, Derek!
Extraordinary courage, man! Just think ...
One inch lower, and that arrow would have ...
Don't lose hope, Odette. Wherever you are, I'll find you.
Quiet!
You've come up with some dumb ideas, Jean-Bob, but this one is a doozy.
Go ahead and laugh! She'll kiss me. And when she does ...
And when she does, poof! You change into a prince. I know, you told me.
Why don't you just give her flowers?
What a love-dunce! I don't want these, I must have those .
When she learns that I have risked my life, the kissing will not stop.
Then you'll change into a prince?
- Mind if I point out a problem? - I don't listen to peasants.
Suit yourself.
Flowers, kiss, concentration! Flowers, kiss, concentration!
Just curious ... How are you gonna get back?
Hurry, hurry!
Move it! No, not that!
Close ...
Grab me! Hold my arm! Hold my leg!
Hold my ... hold it!
Thank you, Odette. Let me have that.
Silence, you savages!
- Are you all right, Jean-Bob? - Oui, oui, Odette.
- What were you trying to do? - He thought ...
- I was getting the flowers for you. - You're being sneaky again.
- You deserve a nice bouquet. - And you deserve a kiss.
All right. My kiss will break your spell.
- Give it up, Jean-Bob. - I can only kiss the man I love.
- And he must ... - Make a vow of everlasting love.
- And prove it to the world. - What do you think I was doing?
- Speed, make him understand! - I'm only a turtle.
If I could break this spell I'd run to him today
and somehow I know he's on his way to me
Derek, you and I were meant to be
for longer than forever
I'll hold you in my heart
it's almost like you're here with me
although we're far apart
for longer than forever
as constant as a star
I close my eyes and I am where you are
sure as the dawn brings the sunrise we've an unshakable bond
destined to last for a lifetime and beyond
for longer than forever
I swear that I'll be true
I've made an everlasting vow
to find a way to you
for longer than forever
like no love ever known
and with your love I'll never be alone
for longer than forever
much stronger than forever
and with your love
I'll never be alone .
- Is he dead? - No, it's just his wing.
- A strange-looking bird. - He must be in a lot of pain.
- You'd better hold him. - Ready.
Hello! This is your wake-up call!
It takes more than two pond punks to keep Puffin down!
Wait. I'm your friend.
So why are you holding an arrow?
The exact kind of arrow I have ...
- I took it out while you lay there. - You mean you didn't ...
Madam, I apologize. My name is Lieutenant Puffin.
A pleasure, Lieutenant Puffin. I'm Princess Odette.
And these are my best friends. Mr. Lorenzo Trudgealong ...
- Friends call me Speed. - And Jean-Bob.
I have no friends, only servants. They call me "Your Highness."
He thinks he's a prince.
I owe you, Princess. I'll stay until my debt is paid.
- But he has me under a spell. - What? You mean a magical ..?
Your knight in shining armor has come to set you free.
- Let me at him! I'll ... - Chill!
All it takes is one little word. Will you marry me?
Every night you ask that question, and I give you the same answer:
- I'll die first. - You're really starting to bug me.
- Aren't you used to it by now? - Keep pushing it!
- But some day I'm gonna boil over! - I'll never give you the kingdom.
I was hoping you'd say you'd be mine.
It looks as if you need another day to think about it.
No ...
Princess?
Beautiful! Simply beautiful!
Soon Derek will be married, and we'll have a king again.
Derek refuses to be king, unless he finds Odette.
Poppycock! All that will change at tomorrow night's ball.
They're all coming to the ball. Every princess is coming.
You see, Rogers, one of these is bound to change his mind.
Absolutely ... not.
- Do not lose one. - Oh no, no!
- Do not lose one. - Oh no, no! Is Derek still working on the mystery of the fat animal?
- The great animal, Your Highness. - It's large and has fur.
Listen, Derek, it's not what it seems.
What did King William mean?
It's not what it seems ... Of course! It's not what it seems.
Now I'll find you, Odette!
They're coming, Derek! Where are you going?
- To find the great animal! - But be back tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night? - The ball!
Mother, I can't. Please, Mother. Don't do the lip thing.
If I leave now, maybe I can be back in time.
But please, Mother, not one of your beauty pageants.
It's just a few friends ... and their daughters.
This must be big. Every princess must have her own introduction.
- But Madam, you said ... - Forget that. Send for the cooks.
Tell the band to practice. And put four footmen on every carriage!
Maybe five.
Let me get it straight. When the moonlight leaves, you ...
And the next night, if I want to be human, I have to be on the lake.
She just needs moonlight. I have to be smooched.
No fear! You fly to your prince, we bring him back to the lake, -
- the moon comes up, you become a princess, and ... happy ever after!
How will I find him? I don't even know where I am.
- I bet he does. - That's a great idea!
"Monsieur Rothbart, could I borrow a map?"
That's it! A map. Let's do it!
we're off on a mission we're tough, in good condition
there's danger around us they'd hurt us if they found us
we have all the courage we require
try your luck, our plan will fly no fear!
- It's hanging on the wall upstairs. - She'll be lookout. We get the map.
Do you mean "we"?
this plan if applied'll be simply suicidal
- you'll be a sitting duck - no fear!
suppose that I do this who knows if I'll live through this
our team is shy one green webbed-footed volunteer
- no way, Jose, no chance! - no choice, no fear!
- no way, Jose, no chance! - no choice, no fear! No, stop it!
- Quickly! - Easy for you to say.
When I have to do something quick, I always bring a turtle.
I think I pulled a muscle.
I'm gonna die. I know it!
You're going to get us all killed.
we will take any dare the other side'll dare to dream up
we play tough, we play fair but we'll win because we'll team up
- Yikes. - Head for the door.
Okay, Jean-Bob goes deep. Speed gets the hand-off.
I'm open, I'm open.
Get that map!
Saved you!
Reach!
Hey batter, batter, batter.
The crowd's going wild!
no fear
no fear if only one of us knew how to steer!
- get a grip - get set that's our best bet no brakes , no sweat!
that's our best bet no brakes , no sweat!
- we're dead - not yet!
Save me!
no fear
There's Derek's kingdom. When do we leave?
- It's a mouse. - The great animal.
A tad small, wouldn't you say?
Yes, until it changes into this.
An animal that can change its shape. A harmless creature approaches, -
- then suddenly it's too late.
- You mean it could be anything? - Anything!
Odette, I apologize for the way I've been acting.
Derek is very important to you, and I'm just thinking of myself.
- Everyone does that. - Don't make this more difficult.
Accept my apology, please! Now we can kiss and make up.
- Jean-Bob! - What did I say?
- Jean-Bob! - What did I say? Attention! It is zero hour, troops. Odette, prepare for takeoff.
Attention! It is zero hour, troops. Odette, prepare for takeoff. - Is everyone ready? - Ready for action, sir!
- Is everyone ready? - Ready for action, sir!
How about you, Jean-Bob? Jean-Bob ..?
- Highness! - Oui , I am ready.
Good luck. Have a nice flight!
If anything happens to her, I'll have you whipped, flogged, -
- put on the rack, and then have your back legs fried in butter!
- He's in here, Brom. I can feel it. - How will you recognize it?
I'll know. Better stay close.
If you say so.
Derek? Where are you?
Sorry.
Derek?
Derek!
- We'd better watch out for hunters. - At ease, Odette.
I can smell a human a mile away.
- Where did that come from? - Derek! He's here.
You will not lose control. Follow the plan as outlined.
You will not lose control. Follow the plan as outlined. Acknowledge!
Acknowledge!
Odette?
I've got you now. Don't give me that innocent look.
Change! Go ahead, change! I'm not afraid of you.
Derek.
A swan? A swan!
Of course. It's not what it seems.
Just a little closer. Come on ... come on.
- Derek ... - This one's for Odette!
That was close! It's working, here he comes.
Slow down! You're going to lose him.
- Slow down! - He's too close.
Too close? He can't even see us ... Speed up, girl!
- That boy of yours can move. - He's faster than you thought.
Don't worry, Odette. I've been taught what to do in this situation.
When you're in the archer's sights, fly into the sun, use its light.
What did I tell you? All we have to do is stay in the sun.
All right, don't panic!
All right, don't panic! Puffin! Into the trees!
If we don't think of something quick, we're dead ducks.
Remember what the possum said: If there's no escape, play dead.
Gives it the right touch. Wait till I give you a ...
That'll put some distance between us.
- No sign of them yet. - I hope he knows what he's doing.
There they are!
It's almost time. Look!
I can't do it. He'll kill me, Puffin.
If you don't do it now, you've lost your chance.
All right. I'll do it.
- What? - Come on, come on.
Got you!
Hello, Derek.
- Derek, I've missed you so. - No one believed me.
- You can't stay. - Can't stay? I'll never let you go.
- Derek ... Oh, no! - Who is it? What's going on?
It's him. He has me under a spell.
- Let him come! - No, you must go!
- Then you're coming with me. - But I'll turn back into a swan.
- Derek, you must trust me. Go! - There must be a way to break it.
- You must vow everlasting love. - I do! It's all I've ever wanted.
You must prove it to the world. I don't know how.
Go!
The ball. Tomorrow night, come to the castle.
Before the whole world, I will make a vow of everlasting love.
- Odette! - I'm coming. Go!
- Tomorrow night! - Tomorrow night. Now go!
Odette! Didn't you hear me calling?
- I ... - I thought I heard voices.
- Odette, Odette. - Voices?
Yes, voices. What?
I've decided to be your queen.
You mean ..? Odette, you've made me so happy!
I'll be a good king. I'll wear nice clothes, and trim my beard.
You've made me so happy, Odette.
By the way, you wouldn't know who this belongs to?
"Come to the ball.
I will make a vow of everlasting love."
You thought you could fool Rothbart?
I will never be yours, you creature!
- I will marry Prince Derek. - I hate to tell you this, Odette.
But you won't be able to attend the big ball tomorrow night.
If you want to stop me, you'll have to kill me.
I don't think so. You've forgotten something very important.
Tomorrow night there is no moon.
Whatever they do, I'm one step ahead.
On the other hand, Prince Derek's vow could ruin everything.
I'm going to have to deal with him. But how?
The vow! I'll get him to offer his vow to the wrong princess.
That's it. I'll make you look like Odette.
It'll take a lot of work, but it'll be worth it.
Because when he makes his vow to the wrong girl, Odette will die.
Then I'll finish Derek off myself.
Then I'll finish Derek off myself. I love it! This is really classy! This is me!
it's such a hoot to see them quaking
when I'm king they'll treat me with respect
I can't wait to watch their poor hearts breaking
so much for politically correct
up till now I've pulled my punches I intend to eat their lunches
no more Mr. Nice Guy not for me
if you think that I'm hard - hearted
well lamby pie, I haven't even started
no more Mr. Nice Guy no sir-ee!
as soon as my witchcraft has zinged 'em
I'll gain control of the kingdom
as for Odette, well that's tragic
'cause I'm going back to that old black magic
good behavior, it's so much duller
time to show my one true color
Mr. Nice Guy is history
vengeance is what I believe in
I don't get mad, I get even
Odette can't go to the ball I won't bring her
I'll zap up a date who's a real dead ringer
up to no good, I love plotting
'cause I'm so good when I'm rotten
no more Mr. Nice Guy wait and see
I'll become that nasty, naughty, dirty, spiteful
wicked, wayward, way delightful
bad guy I was born to be
One more time!
lying, loathsome, never tender
indiscreet repeat offender
no more Mr. Nice Guy that's not me!
Thank you. Thank you.
- Mother ... what are these? - Roses.
They're red. I don't want red roses.
I want white ones ... like a swan.
Has anyone seen Bromley? Would you feed this to a swan?
Take it back. Get something light and fresh.
No, Rogers, hold it!
Tonight the music must be rubato. Soft and graceful, like a swan.
- A swan? - Have you ever seen a swan?
- Of course I've seen a swan. - What would it sound like in music?
Soft and graceful, Rogers.
- Where is Bromley? - No one has seen him.
- Then who's going to be best man? - You mean ..?
- Oh, Derek! - That's the stuff, Rogers!
Come on, Mother.
Don't be so secretive, Derek. Tell me who she is.
It hurts me to lock you up, Odette. It hurts me deeply.
But then, a king's day is full of tough decisions.
Now you're mad at me again. I can't do nothing right.
But that's me.
I can't leave you like this. If you're not happy, neither am I.
If you can't attend the ball, then I'll bring the ball to you.
If you can't attend the ball, then I'll bring the ball to you. The first thing you'll need is a young man.
The prince is busy, but I can arrange a substitute.
No, please! I beg you!
Poor fellow. He got lost in the woods.
Help, help! Don't go.
I'd love to stay, but if I don't leave now, I'll be late.
Don't give me that look! Had to be sneaky, didn't you?
You had to drag your prince into it.
Well that's fine with me! Fine with me!
every single princess on the planet
prayed to be invited to the ball
every Portia, Guinevere and Janet
came by coach or boat to be here they'd swim the moat to be here
just to be at this historic gala
girls would walk, run or even crawl
rumor is that at this joyous scene tonight
the prince will likely choose his future queen tonight
Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Excuse me, Your Highness. - Yes, Chamberlain?
- It's getting rather crowded. - Then begin the introductions.
And Chamberlain ...
No mistakes! It must be perfect.
Oh no! I mean, oh yes, madam!
Everything will be perfect.
Promise to tell me who it is the moment she arrives.
Don't worry, Mother. You'll know. Believe me, you'll know.
- What? - It's coming. An idea!
- A large, colossal idea! - Sounds big.
I got it! Water leaks into the dungeon, right?
So there must be a hole.
We find it, make it bigger, and ...
- She's loose. - You're forgetting two things.
- His Majesty's got a point. - Not to worry. We need a scout.
Are you crazy? Who's going to jump in the moat?
- He's got to be a good swimmer. - And small!
- Teeny-weeny. - It wouldn't hurt if he was green.
Small, good swimmer, green ... Good grief! You're talking about me.
you're off on a mission you're tough, in good condition ...
Thank you! I know some of you just abhor beauty pageants, -
- but having been a puff-puff girl in '39, I just couldn't resist!
Girls! One ... two ... three!
beauty and glamour and breeding are matched
princesses on parade
lovely, enthralling and unattached
the hoi polloi and well-bred agree each one has a royal pedigree
born for success each possesses a spark
each a remarkable maid
these royal highnesses all have plusses and no minuses
- gaze upon - these princesses on parade!
This princess comes from Colchester, where corn and cotton grow.
She plays croquet and harpsichord and sews her own clothes.
Antonia isn't known to take the path of least resistance.
She hails from Southeast Harristan and came the farthest distance.
Griselda lives to help the world. She finds no task too menial.
And all the other girls think she's the most congenial.
Brunhilde is from Stuttgart where her armor was made.
- Gaze upon ... - princesses on parade!
this is the likely occasion
the heir to the throne picks a wife
this may be the day that Prince Derek will say
"Where have you been all my life?"
brilliant, beguiling a smiling brigade
princesses on parade
each the pride of her community each a golden opportunity
when Crown Prince Derek'll have to choose he'll be hysterical
gaze upon, heap praise upon
these radiant, luminous, dazzling
princesses on parade!
Chamberlain!
All who were invited are present, are they not?
Well, yes. I mean ...
- Open the door, Chamberlain! - But I checked my list ...
It must be the milkman.
Well, it's not the milkman.
No, it can't be!
Excuse me, I've got to get through. Oh! She's lovely, isn't she?
Queen coming through here!
- Who is it? Do you know her? - I don't know.
Rogers! I know he confides in you. Who is it?
I swear I've never seen her before. Although ...
... she does look a lot like ...
But it couldn't be. Could it?
- I was so worried. I thought ... - Nothing could keep me away.
Okay, Speed draws the gators away, then you run for that hole.
If the alligators don't chew me before I get there.
Don't worry! Speed will rush to help.
Ah, yes! Mr. Molasses will rush to help.
- Suddenly I'm full of comfort! - All right. Stretch out!
How did I get talked into this?
- To your mark. - Hey leatherheads!
Come and get me!
Perfect! All right . Ready, get set ... go!
- Faster! - Yes, Jean-Bob, race to your death!
- Get moving, Slowpoke! - Slowpoke?
Any luck?
- Jean-Bob! -To the rescue, mademoiselle!
There's the signal. Time to brush up diving technique.
Yoo-hoo! Those turtles are tough. How about a little white meat?
- We broke through. Let's go! - Thank you, Jean-Bob.
When this is over, remind me to give you a kiss.
What? What is it? Stay away! What are you doing?
No, get away.
I'll tell you when.
Let's go.
Friends call me Speedy.
Go, Odette, go!
Something about you seems ...
I don't know ... different.
Don't worry. After tonight, everything will be perfect.
Yes, of course.
Rogers, I'm going to make an announcement.
Kings and queens, ladies and gentlemen ... Mother.
I have an announcement to make. Today, I have found my bride.
No, Derek! It's a trick!
I present her to you as the future queen of our fair kingdom.
And as proof of my love for her -
- I make a vow to break all vows.
A vow stronger than all the powers of the earth.
Before you, and before the whole world ...
... I make a vow of everlasting love.
Derek!
... to Odette.
No more Mr. Nice Guy No sir-ee!
Hello, little prince. Pledged your love to another, did you?
What do you mean? This is Odette.
No! Odette is mine.
It's you! You have no power here!
I made a vow of everlasting love!
You made a vow, all right! A vow of everlasting ... death!
No, Odette!
You should have left her to me. Now she will die.
Odette!
- She's fading fast, little prince! - No!
Something's gone wrong.
If you hurry, little prince, I'll let you see her one last time!
There she is.
I don't think she's gonna make it.
Keep coming, girl!
Odette?
What have I done to you? Forgive me, Odette.
- Derek? - Yes, Odette. I'm here.
Derek, I feel so weak. I think I'm ...
No, you'll live, Odette. The vow I made was for you.
I know. I love you, Derek.
Odette ..? Odette!
I made the vow for her. Do you hear?
The vow I made was for her!
- No need to shout. - Don't let her die.
Is that a threat? Oh, it is a threat!
You're the only one with the power. Now, do it!
Only if you defeat me.
- The great animal! - I'm betting on the animal.
No!
I won't let her die.
The bow! Swim to the bottom of the lake and get Derek's bow.
Throw it, throw it.
Wake up.
Goodbye.
Please, no, please!
Forgive me, Odette.
I only wanted to break the spell.
To prove my love. Forgive me.
I love you. Your kindness and courage.
I always have.
- Derek? - Odette?
Well, there you have it. Everlasting love.
Well, Rogers, old man! I suppose you owe me an apology.
Well, Rogers, old man! I suppose you owe me an apology. If it weren't for me, the great animal would still be alive.
- Dear me, no! - What?
The great animal. It's alive!
- Uberta. - Rogers.
Everyone else is free, but the prince wants a fighting air force.
And it's my job to get you birds in shape.
You're in Puffin's army now. General Puffin.
I am ready for my kiss, mademoiselle.
Don't be too disappointed if nothing happens.
Finally, after all these years, I shall return to my throne.
- Don't forget to write. - You still don't believe me.
The only thing you'll turn is red.
Well, I am ready, Odette.
Voila! Well Speed, what do you have to say now?
That's what I thought. Now, if you don't mind, -
- I've got some schmoozing to do.
- Would you like a kiss too, Speed? - No, I'm happy as a turtle.
Bonjour, madame. The ladies still fall for me.
Now, do you love your son?
Now, do you understand?
You have a $10 million insurance policy. I know that.
Follow these instructions...
...or God be with your child.
You will remove your shirt... ...and hold it out the window to ID the car.
Be professional.
Come alone.
Georgina! Obey me. I will love you. Come on.
- That's how it works, huh? - That's right.
She got a sister?
How's business?
The Japanese are here in a big way.
Cheap labor, factory space, but they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso.
I ferry them back and forth. They think I'm John Wayne.
- I live like a king down here. - Yes, you do.
- You been working? - Yeah. No. No. I've been moving around. You know. Colombia, a couple of places I can't name.
No. I've been moving around. You know. Colombia, a couple of places I can't name.
Nothing catches my fancy.
You think God'll forgive us for what we've done? - No. - You don't?
- No. - You don't? Me either.
- How long you staying? - I don't know, I just, you know...
I wanted to see you, Ray, see how you're doing.
I just came by on impulse.
I could do with some impulse.
What happened?
Family paid the ransom, then they sent the kid home after a couple of days.
Minus an ear, of course.
Now every mother in Mexico City with money wants bigger bodyguards. - My own wife included. - I hate to break it to you, but she's right.
- My own wife included. - I hate to break it to you, but she's right. She's right.
Look, Sammy, all my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
I have a policy. AIG. My dad gave it to me.
Yeah, I know. I got it for your dad.
But what'll you do in 60 days when you can't renew it because you have no bodyguard?
I know. I had to let Emilio go.
Well, you gotta please Lisa. I mean, ass like that's hard to find.
Look.
A bodyguard's like anything else. You get what you pay for, okay?
You could do this. Get one that's got a decent résumé. We're not looking for goddamn Superman, right? Get someone cheap.
We're not looking for goddamn Superman, right? Get someone cheap.
So you renew the policy, and then fire the prick for whatever, incompetence.
All kidding aside, the most important thing is that your daughter goes back to school,
and that your wife gets to save face.
This way you won't be the only unprotected family in the neighborhood.
That's right, a bodyguard. Your Spanish is good enough.
- You're crazy. - You even look the part.
In my state, I couldn't guard a corpse.
It's rich guys flashing their cash. It's all for show. Nothing's gonna happen.
Yeah? You think they'd hire a drunk, a has-been?
You have to keep it under control.
What if there was, you know... Just, say, a kidnapping attempt? What do I do then?
You do your best. They're not gonna be paying you enough to perform miracles.
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed, you're pretty damn good.
Yeah. A bodyguard's gotta be close to people, though. They talk all the time. You know I'm no good at that.
You'll be the silent type. They're gonna appreciate that.
Bodyguard. So who's the guy?
Samuel Ramos. He's a young guy.
- He owns one of the plants in Juárez. - Yeah?
The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him.
I think he's in trouble. His family lives in Mexico City.
He asked me if I knew anybody he could trust.
- And you thought of me? - Yeah.
Take a job, Crease. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to stick around.
Besides, I'm glad to see you, you know? I got nobody to talk to down here.
Listen, my wife wants someone presentable and polite.
You'll be the fifth candidate she sees this week.
Your résumé's quite impressive.
Sixteen years of military experience, extensive counter-terrorism work.
I'm surprised anybody could afford you. What's the catch?
I drink.
How does that affect you?
Coordination, reaction time.
If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, I'll do the best I can,
but the service will be on a par with the pay.
What if amateurs try it?
I'd probably kill them. Is that likely?
No.
No one is to know about your drinking. That includes my wife.
Lisa!
My wife Lisa. And this is John Creasy.
- You're an American. - So are you.
It's all in there.
- Would you like a drink? - Yes. Jack and water would be good.
Have you done much of this kind of work before? No, ma'am.
But he has a lot of experience in related fields.
- Do you have a family, Mr. Creasy? - No.
Pita? Pita.
- Yes, Mom? - Honey, this is Mr. Creasy.
It's English, honey. Do you wanna show Mr. Creasy to his room?
- This way, Mr. Creasy. - Okay.
Thank you.
Just like that?
I think it's nice that he's an American.
I think it's terrific. Are you sure?
Thank you. Thank you.
I feel better now.
That's Bruno, the gardener. And that's Maria, the cook.
We fixed the room up two weeks ago. It's nicer than before.
You've got a TV and a CD player. What kind of music do you like, Mr. Creasy?
- I don't know. - You don't know?
I don't know.
That's Bird. Emilio forgot to take him when he left.
Emilio was my last bodyguard.
Have you protected a lot of children before, Mr. Creasy?
Creasy. You can call me Creasy. And no, you're the first.
Bye, Creasy.
Bye, Bird.
- School tomorrow, Peeps. - Does that mean we can get a dog?
Dad promised me one when I went back to school. Yeah, we'll see.
If you get a dog, will you give up your bear? You're getting too old for him.
- How did you like Mr. Creasy? - Creasy. He said to call him just Creasy.
- That isn't disrespectful, is it? - No, not if he asked you.
Here. There you go.
He's like a bear too. - Yeah? - A big, sad bear.
- Yeah? - A big, sad bear.
- Is he sad? - I think. Or something.
Good night, honey.
Can you get me some floss in the morning? - Floss? - Yeah, the strawberry kind.
Sure.
Good night, Bear.
Creasy Bear.
- What's that one for? - La Virgen de Guadalupe.
Business. For Toyota, for Ford.
If one dies, maybe she can resurrect the other one. I don't know.
She likes him.
- What are you talking about? - Creasy.
Pita likes him.
Pita loves school. Pita would love Count Dracula if he took her back there, honey.
Okay?
Hey. Are you okay?
- I don't know. - Okay?
I don't know, Lisa. I'm trying.
Come on, Bird.
That's right, that's right. Come on.
All right.
Home to Emilio.
You're home free, baby.
- Where are you from, Creasy? - The U.S.
- I know, but which state? - No state in particular.
- You can drive and talk at the same time. - No, I can't, so please let me do my job.
Are you going to stay?
My last bodyguard left. Somebody gave him more money than we could.
I guess that makes me a bargain, then, huh?
Being black. Is that a positive or a negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Time will tell.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. - Four a day. - Yeah? Twenty-four?
- Four a day. - Yeah? Twenty-four? - Twenty-four. What do you think? - I think you know more than you should.
- Twenty-four. What do you think? - I think you know more than you should. Well, thank you.
- See you later. - You have to sign.
- What? - You have to sign in. Show them your ID.
Come on.
Right there.
Pita! It's so good to have you back.
Sister Anna, this is my new bodyguard, Creasy.
- Sister Anna, the headmistress. - Señor Creasy.
- Hurry. Class is about to begin. Go, go. - Bye, Creasy.
You must look after our Pita. It is not good that she is late today.
I'm very sorry. I have to get used to the routes. It won't happen again.
No offense, but I regret that your profession needs to exist.
So do I, Madre, so do I.
Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?
No, not for a long time.
The Bible says, "Be not overcome of evil..."
"But overcome evil with good."
That's Romans Chapter 12 Verse 21.
I am the sheep that got lost, Madre.
When you were a kid, Creasy, did you like school? - I don't remember. - You don't remember?
- I don't remember. - You don't remember? No, I don't remember. No, I didn't like it.
No, I don't remember. No, I didn't like it. Why not?
Because it wasn't a school like yours, Pita. There was no Sister Anna.
Were you unhappy?
Being unhappy, that's a state of mind. I really don't remember.
What happened to your hand?
- It's a birth defect. - No, it's not.
Look, no more questions, okay?
- It really wasn't a question. - It sounded like a question to me.
Listen to me. I'm being paid to protect you.
No, no, no. I'm being paid to be your bodyguard. Look at me.
I'm not being paid to be your friend, but to protect you. So no more questions, period.
- Do you hear me? - Yes.
- No crying. - I'm not crying.
Well, don't start.
You gotta understand, this is a job. In order for me to do my job...
Wait a minute.
Yeah, come in.
Mr. Creasy.
I just wanted to make sure you have everything you need. I'm fine, thanks.
Is the food all right? Because Maria told me you didn't eat.
Yeah, the food is great. I just wasn't that hungry tonight.
So you read the Bible?
Yeah, sometimes.
Does it help? Yeah, sometimes.
- Can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure.
How are you doing with Pita?
Fine.
As soon as she figures out that I'm not her new toy, it'll be fine.
- She told me about that. - Okay.
- You don't have children, do you? - I told you I didn't.
Well, they can be tenacious when they want something. And Pita just wants to be friends.
Okay. But you're paying me to protect her, not to be her friend, right?
So...
Look, maybe this isn't gonna work out.
Maybe your husband should find somebody that's a little more sociable.
No, you're right.
You're being paid to protect her.
And I'm confident that you'll do that.
I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I hope that's all right.
You think God'll forgive us for what we've done?
I'm tired of killing, Ray. I'm tired of killing, Ray.
You think God'll forgive us for what we've done?
In my state, I couldn't... I couldn't guard a corpse.
They talk all the time.
You know I'm no good at that.
You know how they say...
a bullet always tells the truth?
Yeah? - Hey. - Crease.
- Hey. - Crease. What's wrong?
Hey, listen, you ever have a 9mm round that didn't go off?
Yeah. Failure to fire.
I know, failure to fire and...
You know, I pulled the trigger and click, nothing.
- You're talking about a bad primer. - Yeah, yeah, but I...
Yeah, right. Dimple on the primer. That may be...
Well, like we used to say...
a bullet always tells the truth.
Crease? You all right?
Yeah.
What were you shooting at?
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ray. I'm sorry I woke you.
No, it's okay, it's nothing. I was watching TV.
Okay.
Pita, you have a pencil?
Thank you.
- It's hard to get used to the traffic here. - Yeah. I'm very sorry.
- See you, baby. - See you later.
- Hey, don't forget your towel. - Thank you.
Bye.
- You're a strong swimmer. - I never win.
Thanks.
So, what do I do?
You're the fastest in the water, the slowest off the blocks. What do you think that means? What you gotta do?
- Get faster off the blocks? - Get faster off the blocks.
- Our big swim meet is in three weeks. - Yeah?
- I was gonna enter the 150 freestyle. - You'll be fine. You'll be okay.
- I'll still be slow. - You're not slow.
- I never finish better than third. - Then maybe you are slow.
With us this evening we have Mariana Guerrero from Reforma newspaper
to speak with us about the kidnappings.
Who are the ones responsible for the kidnappings in Mexico?
It is an activity of organized crime. It's not a random kidnapping.
They are not political kidnappings like in Colombia.
How do you think he got out?
I let him go.
- It's better to be free, right? - It's better for him.
Actually, he was driving me crazy.
Good night.
Good night.
- See you in a couple of days. I love you. - Love you.
Be good. Come on, Lise.
All right, sweetheart, so we'll call you from Detroit, okay?
- I love you. - Love you.
- Okay, bye, honey. I love you! - Love you.
I hate leaving her.
Concentrating?
Eyes are closed?
- What happened? - I flinched.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
- The gunshot holds no fear. - The gunshot holds no fear! Say it!
- The gunshot holds no fear. - The gunshot holds no fear! Say it! - The gunshot holds no fear. - Louder!
- The gunshot holds no fear. - Louder! - The gunshot holds no fear! - Louder! - The gunshot holds no fear! - That's good. You welcome the sound.
- The gunshot holds no fear! - That's good. You welcome the sound. In fact, it's the sound that sets you free.
You are a prisoner on this block until that sound sets you free. Are you ready?
- Yes. - Are you ready? Are you set?
Creasy?
What's a concubine?
- Why do you ask? - It's in my history book.
- It's like a wife, right? - Yeah, yeah, it's...
Can I see that? It's kind of a wife.
Right there. But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them.
Okay, like nowadays, in the West, they have one husband for one wife.
But in the olden-time cultures they had, you know, different... Different rules.
Why? You feel sorry for the husband? Yeah. Can you imagine my mom multiplied by a thousand?
Creasy. - You're smiling. - What?
- You were smiling. - No, I'm not.
- You were. - No, I was not.
- You're not now, but you were. - You were smiling. I wasn't.
- You were. - When?
- Five seconds ago. - I'm not smiling.
- Well, a second ago you were. - You said five seconds ago. Now that's six.
- Well, a second ago you were. - You said five seconds ago. Now that's six. - Ten seconds ago. - Ten seconds ago I was smiling.
- Ten seconds ago. - Ten seconds ago I was smiling. Okay, in the next ten seconds, we'll see who smiles first.
- You smiled already. See? You did. - You.
No, that wasn't a... That was a smirk.
That's not a smile. A smirk is different. They start with S, but they're not the same.
- Do your homework. - You were.
Bang!
Stop, stop, stop. Come back, come back.
Bang!
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Come here. Hurry up, hurry up.
Set.
Bang! Bang!
You don't flinch when you hear the gunshot, understand?
Listen for the sound. You don't anticipate. Concentrate on the sound. Understand me?
They're gaining on you. Go, go, go, go!
Stop, stop! Come on, get out. Let's go again.
- Daddy! - Come here, girl.
- I missed you so much. - I missed you.
I got a surprise for you. Are you ready?
You got me a dog! You got me a dog!
- You bought me a dog! Oh, my gosh! - What do you think?
Oh, my gosh. Just what I wanted. What's his name?
- Sam. Like Dad. - Come on, Sam! Come on, Sam!
State...
Bhutan. It's a Himalayan kingdom.
They were having some problems with the royal family not long ago. Okay.
Any more questions?
- Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy? - What? No. What kind of question is that?
- You're supposed to be studying history. - It's Creasy history.
- No, ancient history. - Who was your very first girlfriend?
- Nonya. - Nonya? Nonya business, that's who. Okay?
Hi.
Tomorrow after you drop off Pita, could you take me to get my hair done?
Yes, ma'am.
All right. Well, I'll...
I'll leave you to your history.
- Good night. - Good night, honey.
- Okay, now ask me. - Ask you what?
Go, Pita! Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
- 10.99. - Yes!
- I'm tough, Creasy. - No such thing as tough.
There's trained and there's untrained. Now, which are you?
- Trained. - Trained. Okay, we'll go again.
- Here. - Stand here near the finish line. Okay. Hey.
I'm a prisoner in the block until the gunshot sets me free.
That's right. Don't smile, don't fool around if you wanna win. Trained or untrained?
- Trained. - Go.
- Señor Creasy, nice to see you. - Good to see you, Madre.
Pita's parents are away on business in Juárez. Today, you are her father.
I won, Creasy! I won!
- Once upon a time, when we were young... - When I was young.
Well, when we were young and he was younger,
and all heads turned our way,
we made a deal to take the world together.
Yeah, then one day I got a call, and you said...
"I'm in love, I'm in love!" "And I'm moving to Mexico!"
And I said: I said, "What happened to the plan? What happened to it?"
- I said, "The plan's right here!" - Yeah, yeah. And what'd I do?
I hung up. And then I met Alicia.
And then I went, "Now I got you. I got you."
I got it. Can I kiss her?
Absolutely.
Hey, what are you doing?
- You got me. - Okay, I think now's as good a time as any.
I bought it with my own money.
Thank you.
Open it.
It's Saint Jude, the patron saint of lost causes.
Well deserved.
Thank you, Pita. It's beautiful.
You're welcome.
- Dad? - Yes, sweetie?
- Can I talk to you? - Yes.
I don't wanna play piano, I wanna swim.
It's not open for discussion, honey, okay? Mr. Lozzi's a very, very famous teacher.
If he accepts you as a student, you're gonna play the piano. Sorry.
- Whatever. - Baby.
- I love you. - Love you.
- I just want what's best for you, you know? - Okay.
Okay, honey.
If you broke all my fingers, then taped them back together,
I wouldn't be able to play piano, but I could still swim.
Sam, get back.
Don't be a crybaby. You're tougher than that.
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.
Remember the day you wanted the pencil? - Yeah. - I know why.
- Yeah. - I know why. Yeah?
You wanted the license number off of that car. I wrote it down in my notebook.
I got it all but the last number.
I'll get it from you later. Can you belch?
Like burp. Can you burp?
- That's good. That's very good. - I just had a Coke.
Listen to me. This famous teacher... He teaches a lot of rich kids and plays for the symphonies and all that, right?
Belch every few minutes while you're practicing. You apologize to him, but keep belching. You'll offend every sensibility he has.
You apologize to him, but keep belching. You'll offend every sensibility he has.
Very good. You'll be back in the pool in 24 hours, I guarantee you.
Right, Sam?
Lupita Ramos.
For you, Creasy.
Thank you.
- How does this look? - Good. Good.
Come on in. - Bye. - Bye.
- How long? - One hour.
Pita!
Run!
I can't...
John W. Creasy is under arrest for the murder of two officers of the Judicial Police.
This man, John W. Creasy,
an American citizen,
is under arrest for the murder
of two officers of the Judicial Police
and is suspected of possible involvement
in the kidnapping of Lupita Martin Ramos.
Chief Ramirez...
The two officers who were killed.
Records show they were off duty at the time.
So why were they in uniform
and in a patrol car?
All I know is that they died bravely.
Of course,
but what exactly were they doing
at the scene of the kidnapping?
Or were they known for their exceptional good luck?
They were known for being corrupt
and now are celebrated for being dead.
Excuse me.
Relax, okay? Relax, Sammy.
I know she's your little girl. When I tell you everything's gonna be all right, everything's gonna be all right.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Victor Fuentes, Anti-Kidnapping Division, Policía Judicial.
Excuse me. I'm Jordan Kalfus. I'm the family attorney.
Speak slower, please. My Russian is better than my English.
I'm conducting the negotiations, and we neither need nor want police assistance.
We're gonna handle this thing ourselves.
Señor Ramos, two police officers were killed during your daughter's abduction.
I have a written order from
the Public Minister...
authorizing our participation "unofficially."
If you want to speak to Attorney General Diaz, it's on me.
Okay.
The kidnapper will tell you to deliver the money alone.
Por favor, don't do that.
Or you will find yourself in a real Mexican hell. No mariachi, no tequila...
and no Pita.
Crease?
When I heard it was this hospital, I was so pleased.
There is a pastry shop nearby. Delgado's.
They have the best pastries in Mexico.
Miguel Manzano. Director of the AFI.
And a former director of Interpol, in Rome.
- And you are? - A friend of his. Rayburn.
Do you love your daughter, Señor Ramos?
Yes. Yes.
- Do you want to see her again? - Yes, I do.
If your daughter's life is as important to you as it is to me,
you will do as I say.
Yes?
Okay, yes.
Crease. You hear me?
You got four of them, all dead.
- Pita? - It's...
It's been two days.
They're negotiating a ransom.
These things take time, Mr. Creasy.
Crease.
Don't fuck with me, all right?
You have the ten million? Do you have the money?
- Yes, we have the money. - Now, if you do as I say,
the girl will be returned exactly as she was taken.
But if you deviate from the process in any way...
By the Virgin of Guadeloupe,
I swear you will never see her again.
I understand. Listen, I too worship la Virgen de Guadalupe...
I ask if you understand.
Hello, sir. This is Mr. Ramos's attorney.
He's going through a very difficult time, but he understands.
Do you understand? Repeat the drop instructions.
Okay, the money, 10 million, will be divided into two 15-gallon black canvas bags,
each containing five million, which will be checked at the bank by the KR agent,
then driven to the house where it will be transferred to the delivery car.
You got a flat tire here.
This is for you.
Hello. Yeah. Listen, I need a driver to drive Samuel.
No. Why?
He's got a bad ticker. He's got a heart condition.
Look, he's a nervous kid. He doesn't respond well to stress.
All right, but the car will not be powerful.
Remove the trunk lid. Use the maid's Valiant Acapulco.
You will arrive at La Diana fountain at 1 a.m.
You will drive around the circle two times.
Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window
to ID the car.
There is a payphone on the southeast corner.
The phone will ring. You will answer and wait for instructions.
There is a map on the top of the phone. Follow it.
- What are you doing? He said no phones. - Relax, relax. I'm just trying to protect your daughter, okay?
What's going on?
Hospitals can be very dangerous places,
especially when you have killed two corrupt cops.
Leave the money in the trunk of the white car
and return to your car.
Do not look back.
What's going on, guys?
Ambush!
Remember, I'm a professional.
If you keep your word, I will keep mine.
- Hello? - Mr. Ramos.
You betrayed me. You killed my nephew.
You took my money.
Señor Ramos...
God be with your child.
All right. Get out of here, all of you. Get the fuck out of my house!
Okay, this is Lisa... Martin Ramos. I'm Pita's mother.
Martin Ramos. I'm Pita's mother.
And I'm very sorry for whatever happened to your nephew, but I beg you...
Please don't harm my daughter.
This conversation is not being recorded.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I wish we had talked sooner, señora.
I'm really sorry.
Now it is too late.
Fuck off! Get the fuck out of my fucking house! Now!
Get out! Get out!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Ray. How are you...?
- Where am I? - Well, it looks like a dog hospital.
Manzano was afraid the cops were gonna kill you.
How you doing, doc?
What's the matter?
She's dead, Crease.
It's a mess. Somebody hijacked the drop and...
The kidnapper's nephew was killed, so he killed Pita.
He has gunshot wounds to the chest and the abdomen.
He has a collapsed lung which we've re-inflated.
He's lucky to be alive. If he doesn't rest, he will die.
How long will he be hospitalized?
Approximately a month.
No.
Did you recognize any of these men?
No. Does that make me a suspect?
No. It would be convenient, but no.
Maybe you should show me pictures of Mexican cops. Maybe we'll get somewhere.
Those were all policemen.
Bad Judicial cops,
protected, by a brotherhood.
A brotherhood?
A brotherhood called... "La Hermandad."
"La Hermandad."
You all set?
- Right arm. - Yeah.
- You okay? - Yeah, I'm all right.
Let's go.
- Somebody's on us. - Yeah.
- Lois Lane. - Who?
Mariana something, works for Reforma.
Newspaper journalist.
I guess she thinks you're a scoop.
I'll get you up to the border. A friend will take you to San Diego, drop you at the Naval Hospital.
I'm not going, Ray.
What are you gonna do?
Let's take a ride by the crime scene. She can follow us.
Mr. Creasy?
A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm Mariana García Guerrero.
Reporter, for Reforma.
Nice to meet you.
I found this across the street.
Open it.
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship.
- They've put a curse on you. - A little late.
- What are you going to do? - I'm gonna get in my truck and leave.
I can help you.
There's a brotherhood called La Hermandad.
It protects government officials, corrupt police and organized crime
at a level that is too difficult for me to reach.
Okay.
And I think that you and Lupita Ramos are victims of this organization.
I want to expose them. Talk to me, give me your story, and then I can help you. Please.
Help me do what?
You're gonna help me do what?
- You're a stranger here, no? - That's right.
You're going to need friends that know their way around.
Okay.
Okay, friend that's gonna help me.
Pleasure to meet you.
Tell your driver to keep his distance next time. All right, friend?
- You'll be Stateside by supper time. - I'm gonna need some help first, though.
You don't stop bleeding, you won't last a day in your shape.
- Is that a yes or is that a no? - Yeah! But... - I'm done killing. I told you that. - Okay.
- I'm done killing. I told you that. - Okay. Anything else is yours.
- You're talking about war, Crease. - Exactly. Can you help me?
- Yeah. - Good.
Creasy?
What are you doing here?
I came to get my stuff.
Couldn't find my Bible. I thought it might be in here.
- I borrowed it. - Okay.
It's crazy, huh?
One week we're figuring out which nightclub to go to, and the next thing I'm... reading the Bible.
It's a good thing. You hold on to it.
I keep thinking if only we hadn't...
It's like...
My whole life all I've ever thought about was what I could get for myself.
Not my own baby.
She needed me so much, and sometimes I felt like I had nothing to give her.
Just... I don't know what to do.
- What are you gonna do? - What I do best.
I'm gonna kill them.
Anyone involved, who profited from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.
You kill them all.
Yeah, it's me.
- Mr. Creasy. - I need the license... No, excuse me.
I need the name and address of someone whose license number is C5TK8.
I need the name and address of someone whose license number is C5TK8. That's C5TK8.
I got everything but the last digit, so I need ten possible matches.
And when do I find out which of the ten it is? - Eventually. - But where do I reach you?
- Eventually. - But where do I reach you? I'll call you.
Do you know who he is?
Do you know what he's been doing the last 16 years?
Counter-insurgency work in Thailand,
Pakistan...
Jordan, Angola, Lebanon. Yes, I know all of that.
He's an assassin...
and you want to help him identify the owner of a car for him?
He can go places we can't.
If you don't want to use him... I will.
When do I get to sleep with you again?
We never sleep. We fuck.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Jorge González.
I'm a Judicial Policeman.
Drive. Okay.
What are you gonna do?
What I do best.
Anyone involved, who profited from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.
I'm gonna kill them.
Can you hear me?
My head hurts.
I am going to ask questions.
If you don't answer fully and truthfully,
you will suffer much more than you have to.
I'm going to cut your fingers off.
One by one, if I have to.
This is to stop the bleeding.
Don't mess with me.
You know who I am?
A member of La Hermandad.
- Correct. - Okay.
What do you want to know?
The Ramos kidnapping...
What went wrong at the drop?
We were just ordered to take her.
That's all we did.
Ordered by who?
I don't know.
You don't know?
We work in separate groups.
A voice calls.
We grab the target
and deliver it to the guardians.
The bosses never see the target,
they just make the deal.
Who ordered it?
We call him "The Voice."
"The Voice." Okay.
"The Voice."
The Voice. How do I find him?
You don't know?
Are you sure?
Okay.
I believe you.
Tell me about the guardians.
I'm a professional.
I'm a professional. I just do my job.
Tell me about the guardians.
You don't know?
I don't know.
He works the door at a rave in Neza.
He has a mark
on the left side of his face.
They call him "The Butcher."
Is he La Hermandad?
Yes, La Hermandad.
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait.
Give me one cigarette, please, eh?
Okay.
Okay, my friend.
It's off to the next life for you.
I guarantee you won't be lonely.
Revenge is a meal best served cold.
Tell me about the girl.
I don't know her.
Okay, okay. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Tell me about the girl.
Do you know her?
Hey, man, I heard you speaking Spanish over there. You're American, right?
- And so are you. - Yeah.
- Get outta here. Where you from? - New Jersey.
New Jersey? I'm from New Jersey.
All right, listen to me.
Tell me how it works. The whole thing. Tell me how it works.
All right, everything is done by cellphone.
You just wait around for calls. We don't even have a fucking number.
- Who pays you? - We got an ATM card.
We take out 200 fucking measly dollars every two weeks.
- Two hundred dollars? - Yeah.
- Okay. What's the PIN number? - The what?
The PIN number, code number. - Yeah, it's 4747. - 4747?
- Yeah, it's 4747. - 4747?
- You wouldn't lie to me? - I'm not lying.
- You didn't kill her, did you? - No.
Don't lie to me! - Don't lie to me! Did you kill her? - You're making me fucking nervous.
- Did you kill her? - No! The fucking boss did, or his brother.
Who's the boss?
- We never see his face. - You're lying to me.
I'm telling you the truth! Who? You never seen whose face?
Well, we were in the other room.
And he was yelling at the girl because his nephew got killed and the money got stolen.
- Wait. Somebody stole what money? - The ransom money at the drop.
- Who stole it? - He said some fucking crooked cop took it.
- Who? - Fuentes.
- Fuentes? - Yeah, that's him.
- Jersey boy? - Yeah.
- This Fuentes guy... - Yeah?
He's a lieutenant for the Anti-Kidnapping Division. - Fuentes is? - Yeah.
- What'd you do? - Oh, man.
Tell me about the girl. What did you do?
- I just do what they tell me. - You do what they tell you to do?
Did you say goodbye to her? Answer. Did you say goodbye to her?
- No! - You didn't? - Here's your chance. Say goodbye. - Oh, shit.
- Here's your chance. Say goodbye. - Oh, shit. Say goodbye to her. Say goodbye to her.
Motherfucker, let me go!
They threw the little girl against the wall.
She wasn't moving.
They threw her body in the trunk of the car,
and then they drove away.
Who? Who? Who's they?
The boss's brother.
I recognized his voice.
Okay. Okay.
Now listen to me.
If you tell me where to find the boss,
I'll let you live.
But I don't know.
I'll give you the girl. I'll give you the girl.
What girl?
The girl...
Do you want the girl?
Yes, yes, but what girl? What are you saying?
- The girl. - Here?
You sure?
Show me.
- Guerrero. - Listen, it's me.
Do you know about a young girl being kidnapped recently, about 12 years old?
- Yes, last night. Do you know something? - What's her name?
Camila. Camila Valencias.
- I got her. - Where are you?
- Creasy, what happened? - It's okay. Sit down, relax.
She's okay, she's okay.
You got banking connections?
Yes, I have connections.
PIN number's 4747. I wanna find out who's putting money in that account.
4747.
What do you know about a cop named Fuentes?
He's with the Anti-Kidnapping Division. He drove Samuel Ramos to the drop. - Fuentes? - Who is she?
- Fuentes? - Who is she? You can ask her later. She'll tell you anything.
What do you know about Fuentes?
Three years ago they caught him with $50,000 and a dead body in the trunk.
Never charged. The arresting officer couldn't testify because he was dead.
Was he La Hermandad?
- You know where he lives? - He lives in a Judicial compound.
He travels by motorcade.
He's better protected than the president of Mexico. He's gonna need it. Can you take care of her?
- Yes, but how can I find you? - I'll find you.
This is my jurisdiction.
I want this man as much as Creasy does.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals.
Just stay out of his way. I plan to.
I will even help him, if I can.
But... I'd like to understand him.
Give me that.
Pita Ramos...
is a number to you.
One more dead, but a number.
What was she to Creasy, then? She showed him it was all right to live again.
And the kidnappers took that away, huh?
And they're gonna wish they never touched a hair on her head.
A man can be an artist...
at anything, food, whatever.
It depends on how good he is at it.
Creasy's art is death.
He's about to paint his masterpiece.
I don't have anything else to say.
I need the accounts linked to this card.
PIN number is 4747.
On one condition.
I'm not here to hurt you.
In the church, they say to forgive.
Forgiveness is between them and God.
It's my job to arrange the meeting.
Don't move. Put your hands down.
Señor John W. Creasy is under arrest for the murder of two officers of the Judicial Police...
Can you hear me?
You know where we are?
We're under the bridge
where the deal went bad and the ransom got stolen.
You wanna tell me what happened?
- You've heard of La Hermandad? - Yes, I have.
- You know what it is? - Yes.
I'm the president of La Hermandad.
- You're the president? - Yes. The president?
Look at me.
Oh, you can't. I'm sorry. How's that?
I'll show you what I got here.
See this? This is a charger.
It's used by convicts to hide money and drugs.
They stick it in their body, they tuck it up their rectum. You familiar with that?
This... Look at me. Pencil detonator.
Timer. Used as a receiver, a transmitter.
C4. Highly explosive.
You put them all together, you got a bomb. Not very sophisticated, but very powerful.
That's what you have in your ass right now.
Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.
Cheap watch, pager watch,
used to send a page to the receiver that's up your behind right now.
So... I'm gonna send you a page which you will receive...
in five minutes.
You got less than five minutes to tell me what went down between your men and the kidnapper.
I have nothing to do with the kidnapper.
- Four minutes and 30 seconds. - Nothing. I don't know him.
You don't know? Four minutes and 25 seconds.
Four minutes and 20 seconds. Are you sure?
Okay.
I got all the time in the world. You don't, but I do.
- Relax, relax, buddy. - I'm relaxed.
You got three minutes, 59 seconds.
- I saw the opportunity, and I got lucky. - And?
And I had my men ready, as we got instructions where to go.
You had your men ready to steal the drop, ready to kill one of the kidnappers, yeah? You've done this many times.
What's going on, guys?
- One of the nephews of the kidnapper. - Bingo, bingo, yeah.
You've done this many times. Many times, yes.
Yeah. You've killed many victims too, haven't you?
- We just make out as best we can. - "As best we could"?
Two minutes, 47 seconds.
Wait a minute.
- Come on, I have a little gift for you. - For me?
- Yeah, come on. - What have you got?
There was no $10 million. There was two and a half in the bags.
The ransom was $10 million. They put it in two bags, 5 million in each bag.
Two bags, true, but one has half paper,
the other only paper.
Maybe your men stole it.
No, no. Whoever did it took it before the exchange.
Okay.
At the Ramos house, before the exchange,
who put the bags into the car?
- Guess what. - What?
Ramos' lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.
- Jordan Kalfus? - Yeah.
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry for the girl.
It was just business, you know?
I'm a professional.
That's what everybody keeps saying: I'm just a professional.
That's what everybody keeps saying: I'm just a professional. Everybody keeps saying that to me. I'm just a professional.
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing it. Do you understand me?
What are you going to do now?
What am I gonna do? Leave. I gotta go.
Go? Hey, come on, come on. What about me?
What about you? You got 40 seconds.
- Come on. - Thirty-five!
Give me a last wish, please, please.
Last wish? I wish...
you had more time.
- Mariana, it's me. - Creasy, where are you?
I got something like banking codes from Bankcoast in the Cayman Islands.
- I need it translated as fast as you can. - Whose account is it?
Jordan Kalfus.
It looks like U.S. deposits and withdrawals. Give me the same thing on Samuel Ramos.
- That's it? - That's it.
Okay.
Creasy.
- Samuel. - Honey?
What's going on?
That's what I wanna know.
What is going on? Sam?
I'm gonna ask your wife a couple of questions, okay? You move...
You make one sound...
and I'll snatch the life right out of you, you understand?
What happened, Lisa?
Were you in on this, or was it just your husband?
- Am I in on what? - You know what.
Pita's kidnapping, her death. Were you a part of it?
- Pita got killed because the ransom... - Shut up!
Yeah, the money was stolen, you're right. The money was stolen by Victor Fuentes.
How much was stolen? Two-point-five million, right? - What are you talking about? - He knows what I'm talking about.
- What are you talking about? - He knows what I'm talking about. - That's what Victor got. - What are you talking about?
Two-point-five million. Two-point-five million to your lawyer, Jordan Kalfus.
He put it in an account in the Cayman Islands, but he won't get to spend it.
What happened to the other five, Sam?
That's 2.5, 2.5. What is five from ten? Five. What happened to the other five?
Tell your wife. This is your chance.
- You got a wife, Creasy? - No, I don't.
You'll never know how hard it is to tell your wife the truth.
No, you have a wife! You tell me what happened!
- It was in this room that my father... - I don't give a fuck about your father!
He prayed for his gambling debts and his infidelities to be forgiven.
- Samuel! - What? - I love you! Tell me the truth! - I didn't inherit a kingdom! That's the truth!
You wanna know the truth? I inherited his debt and his mess!
- Tell me what happened to my baby! - I inherited his lawyer!
Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Be a fucking man!
Jordan told me she'd sit in a room and watch cartoons all day.
And she'd eat ice cream.
And we'd have her back in two days. He lied to me!
That's why he's fucking dead. I did it!
I did it, Lisa!
I agreed to the kidnapping.
I did it for us. For the three of us.
I'm so sorry, Lisa.
You kill him.
You kill him, or I will.
You know how they say a...
bullet always tells the truth.
It never lies.
It didn't work for me, Samuel,
but maybe...
maybe it'll work for you.
I'll pray for you.
This is definitely the address from the ATM card.
The PIN number was a great locator.
But there's no one that sounds anything like The Voice.
Who's that?
He's the man,
The Voice.
My guys got into the house...
on the pretext of giving cholera shots.
We had to inject the whole barrio.
We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.
Now it's time to pursue him.
We have to put his photo in tomorrow's newspaper.
If you value your life,
you won't publish those photos.
- Mr. Creasy? - Yeah, it's me.
I traced the PIN for you and I have an address. Yeah?
The cardholder is Reina Rosas Sanchez, the wife of "The Voice."
She lives in Los Arcos, apartment 26D, via Appia.
- Good. - And another thing.
In today's paper is a picture of The Voice.
"FEAR HAS A VOICE."
Good. Thank you.
He's in.
What do we do?
Nothing... Nothing.
Out of my house, you son of a bitch!
Stop there!
Get out. The kids out. Now!
Sit down.
Sit down!
Reina Rosas, yes?
Who is this? Who is this?
- Daniel. - Daniel what?
Daniel Rosas Sanchez.
The Voice?
And this is his brother?
What is his name?
What is his name?
Aurelio.
Aurelio Rosas Sanchez, okay.
And you are Daniel's woman, right?
How do you contact him? How do you contact him?
We page him,
and he calls back on his cellphone.
Call him.
There's no signal in here.
We have to go on the roof.
Let's go outside.
Outside.
They're going to get a call.
Be ready to track him.
If we're lucky he'll lead us to The Voice.
Hola, Daniel. - Señor Creasy. - Yeah.
Yeah, I got your family here.
Your brother doesn't look too good.
Yeah, Reina, she's what, about eight months? Yeah?
You wanna negotiate?
The most important thing in life is family. Do you agree?
I agree.
There you are, you have my family.
Well, most of my family.
My wife and I are separated. You know how that is.
Now, tell me seriously, how much do you want?
Your brother wants to speak to you. Here, hold on.
What the hell do you want?
Listen to me! Listen!
I'll take your family apart piece by piece. You understand me? Piece by piece! Shut up!
Piece by piece! Shut up!
I don't want your money.
You understand me? You understand me?
I want you!
I'm listening. I'm listening, Daniel. I'm listening.
I'm listening, Daniel. I'm listening.
All right. I will give you a life for a life.
Whose life? What are you talking about?
Whose life, Daniel? I want you!
I will give you her life. For your life.
And in exchange, I will get my life back.
- What life? Whose life? - The girl's. Pita's.
- Pita's dead! - Creasy!
I'm a businessman. A girl dead is worth nothing. She's alive.
All right.
I want proof of life, you hear me? I want proof of life. I want...
I want the name of her bear. What does she call her bear?
You tell her to tell you to tell me what she calls her bear.
Little one...
What do you call your teddy bear?
Yeah?
Creasy. She calls the bear Creasy Bear.
Remember...
I will give you her life
for your life
and the life of my brother.
Okay.
Okay.
I give you your brother, you give me the girl.
- All right. - Where?
He left the roof. We lost the signal.
We got cut off.
We lost him. We lost him.
Damn.
- Hello? - Lisa, listen to me. Don't hang up.
I think Pita's alive.
I can't take this anymore.
Take the road to Puebla. Get off junction 34, south side.
I'll meet you there in two hours.
So where is she?
She's right over there. You see those two cars out there?
Pita's kidnapper, Daniel...
Here's his brother.
Here.
I'm going up on the bridge to get Pita.
Anything goes wrong, you put it to his head,
you pull the trigger, all right?
You understand?
You don't let him loose
until she's with you, you got it?
And you don't wait for me, okay?
- Yeah. - You'll be all right. You okay?
Yeah.
Creasy!
Creasy!
Creasy!
- You all right? - Yeah. They didn't hurt you?
Hi.
All right, your mother's waiting for you. She's at the end the bridge.
- Okay, you go home. - Okay.
- All right. - Where are you going?
I'm going home too.
I'm going to Blue Bayou.
Hey. I got something for you.
I got the last number too.
I love you, Creasy.
And you love me, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Now, come on, Pita, go.
- Go. Run. - Bye.
- Mom! - Baby, come here! It's okay!
- Mom! - Come on.
There he is! Hit it again!
Success!
Count, it's just you.
I was beginning to lose faith, Victor.
A pity your moment of triumph is being spoiled
over a little thing like grave robbery.
Yes. Yes.
I must... I must escape this place.
[Dracula] Where are you going to run, Victor?
Your peculiar experiments have made you unwelcome
in most of the civilized world.
I'll take him away, far away, where no one will ever find him.
No, no, Victor.
The time has come for me to take command of him.
What are you saying?
Why do you think I brought you here? Gave you this castle?
-Equipped your laboratory? -You said...
-You said you believed in my work. -And I do.
But now that it is, as you yourself have said,
a triumph of science
over God,
it must now serve my purpose.
-What purpose? -[thunder rumbling]
Good God!
I would kill myself before helping in such a task.
Feel free. I don't actually need you anymore, Victor.
I just need him.
He is the key.
I could never allow him to be used for such evil.
I could.
In fact, my brides are insisting upon it.
Igor, help me!
[Igor] You have been so kind to me, Doctor,
caring, thoughtful.
But he pays me.
Stay back.
You can't kill me, Victor.
-I'm already dead. -[thunder rumbling]
Dr. Frankenstein!
Look, it's headed for the windmill! Come on!
Burn it! Burn it down!
[woman] Vampires.
-[man 1] Run for your lives! -[man 2 in Hungarian] Vampires!
Father.
Evening.
You're a big one. You'll be hard to digest.
-I'd hate to be such a nuisance. -[Mr. Hyde laughing]
I missed you in London.
No, you bloody did not! You got me good.
Dr. Jekyll, you're wanted by the Knights of the Holy Order--
It's Mr. Hyde now.
For the murder of 12 men, six women, four--
Children, three goats, and a rather nasty massacre of poultry!
So you're the great Van Helsing.
And you're a deranged psychopath.
We all have our little problems.
My superiors would like for me to take you alive
so that they may extricate your better half.
I bet they bloody would.
Personally, I'd rather just kill you and call it a day.
But let's make it your decision, shall we? Mmm. Do let's.
Mmm. Do let's.
[Mr. Hyde] Here I come, ready or not!
The bell! The bell!
No, no, no...
I'll bet that's upsetting.
Oh, Paris!
Come here.
I think you'll find the view over here rather spectacular.
It's been a pleasure knowing you. Au revoir!
Oh, no. No, no, no!
My turn.
[in Latin] May he rest in peace.
Van Helsing.
You murderer!
[sighing] Bless me, Father, for I have--
[Father] Sinned. Yes, I know. You're very good at that.
You shattered the Rose Window.
Not to split hairs, sir, but it was Mr. Hyde who did the shattering.
Thirteenth century. Over 600 years old.
-I wish you a week in hell for that. -It would be a nice reprieve.
Don't get me wrong. Your results are unquestionable
but your methods attract far too much attention.
"Wanted" posters? We are not pleased.
Do you think I like being the most wanted man in Europe?
Why don't you and the Order do something about it?
Because we do not exist.
Well, then neither do I.
[Father] When we found you crawling up the steps of this church, half-dead,
it was clear to all of us that you had been sent to do God's work.
-Why can't he do it himself? -Don't blaspheme.
You already lost your memory as a penance for past sins.
If you wish to recover it
I suggest you continue to heed the call.
Without us, the world would be in darkness.
Governments and empires come and go
but we have kept mankind safe since time immemorial.
We are the last defense against evil.
An evil that the rest of mankind has no idea even exists.
To you, these monsters are just evil beings to be vanquished.
I'm the one standing there when they die
and become the men they once were.
For you, my good son, this is all a test of faith.
And now, we need you to go to the East.
To the far side of Romania.
An accursed land
terrorized by all sorts of nightmarish creatures.
Lorded over by a certain Count Dracula.
-Dracula? -Yes.
You've never faced one like this before.
Our story begins 450 years ago
when a Transylvanian knight, named Valerious the Elder,
promised God that his family would never rest nor enter heaven
until they vanquished Dracula from their land.
They have not succeeded
and they are running out of family.
His descendant, Boris Valerious, King of the Gypsies.
He disappeared almost 12 months ago.
His only son, Prince Velkan, and his daughter, Princess Anna.
If the two of them are killed before Dracula is vanquished,
nine generations of their family
will never enter the gates of St. Peter.
For more than four centuries
this family has defended our left flank.
They gave their lives.
We cannot let them slip into purgatory.
So you're sending me into hell.
In a manner.
Valerious the Elder left this here 400 years ago.
We don't know its purpose
but he would not have left it lightly.
The Latin inscription translates as,
"In the name of God, open this door."
There is an insignia.
Yes, it matches your ring.
I think that in Transylvania you may find the answer you seek.
[Carl] Faster, please. Faster! Faster! Faster!
Getting there.
-Carl! -Ah, there you are.
Well, did you bring Mr. Hyde back, or did you kill him?
You killed him, didn't you? That's why they get so annoyed.
When they ask you to bring someone back, they don't mean as a corpse.
Oh, all right, you're in a mood. Well, come on.
I've got a few things that'll put the bit back in your mouth.
-Any idiot can make a sword. -Hey!
Sorry, Father.
-Come along, Carl. -Here, take this.
Rings of garlic, holy water,
silver stake, crucifix.
Why can't I have one of those?
You've never gone after vampires before now, have you?
Vampires, gargoyles, warlocks, they're all the same.
-Best when cooked well. -No, no, no, they're not all the same.
A vampire is nothing like a warlock. My granny could kill a warlock.
Carl, you've never even been out of the abbey.
-How do you know about vampires? -I read.
Here's something new.
Glycerin 48.
[Carl] Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
[man] What in the name of Allah is wrong with you?
The air around here is thick with envy. Ah.
This is my latest invention. It's gas-propelled.
Capable of catapulting arrows in rapid succession
at tremendous velocity. Just pull the trigger and hold on.
I've heard the stories coming out of Transylvania.
Trust me, you'll need this. A work of certifiable genius.
-If you don't say so yourself. -No, I did say so myself.
I'm a veritable cornucopia of talent.
Did you invent this?
I've been working on that for 12 years.
It's compressed magma from Mt. Vesuvius
with pure alkaline from the Gobi Desert.
-It's one of a kind. -What's it for?
Oh, I don't know, but I'm sure it'll come in handy.
Twelve years, and you don't know what it does?
I didn't say that. I said I didn't know what it's for.
What it does is to create a light source
equal to the intensity of the sun.
This will come in handy how?
I don't know. You can blind your enemies.
Charbroil a herd of charging wildebeest.
Use your imagination.
No, Carl, I'm gonna use yours. That's why you're coming with me.
-Holy hell be damned that I am! -You cursed.
Not very well, but you're a monk.
You shouldn't curse at all.
Actually, I'm still just a friar. I can curse all I want,
damn it!
The Cardinal has ordered you to keep me alive.
-For as long as possible. -But I'm not a field man.
Van Helsing...
I don't want to go to Transylvania.
Come on.
Dracula unleashed you for a reason.
Pull me up! Pull me up!
It's stuck!
-No, Anna, it will kill you! -That's my brother out there.
Cut the rope! Cut it now!
Velkan!
My gun! Find my gun!
Find Velkan's gun. It has to be the silver bullets.
Anna, hurry! Hurry!
Move.
Anna, look out!
Run!
Velkan.
God,
help us.
-So, what do you remember? -Not now, Carl.
There must be something.
I remember fighting the Romans at Masada.
-That was in 73 A.D. -You asked.
What are we doing here?
Why is it so important to kill this Dracula, anyway?
-Because he's the son of the Devil. -I mean, besides that.
If we kill him, anything bitten or created by him will also die.
I mean, besides that.
Welcome to Transylvania.
-Is it always like this? -Pretty much.
[Anna] You, turn around.
-Let me see your faces. -Why?
Because we don't trust strangers.
Strangers don't last long here. 5'7" by 2'3".
[Anna] Gentlemen, you will now be disarmed.
You can try.
[Anna] You refuse to obey our laws?
-The laws of men mean little to me. -Fine.
Kill them.
-I'm here to help you. -I don't need any help.
Really?
Everybody inside!
[woman] Hide the children!
-Stay here -[grunts]
You stay here. They're trying to kill me.
-Marishka, kill the stranger. -Love to.
[Anna] Run!
Carl, it's not working.
[Carl] Try aiming at their hearts.
It's the sun.
Van Helsing.
Do you like to fly, Anna?
-[gasps] -Hello, Anna.
Nice to see you, too, Aleera.
Did I do something to you in a past life?
Don't play coy with me, Princess.
I know what lurks in your lusting heart.
I hope you have a heart, Aleera,
because someday I'm going to drive a stake through it.
This should do the trick.
Holy water!
Stop your teasing, Marishka, and finish him.
Too bad. So sad.
The church!
Thirty years old.
Perfectly aged.
Hello, Anna, my dear.
The last of the Valerious.
I can feel fresh blood rushing through her veins.
Here she comes!
I want first bite.
-[woman] He killed a bride! -[man 1] He killed Marishka!
[man 2] You killed Marishka!
-[man 3] You killed a vampire! -But isn't that a good thing?
Vampires only kill what they need to survive.
One or two people a month.
Now they will kill for revenge.
-Are you always this popular? -Pretty much.
So what name, my good sir, do I carve on your gravestone?
His name is Van Helsing.
Your reputation precedes you.
Next time stay close. You're no good to me dead.
Well, I'll say this for you. You've got courage.
He's the first one to kill a vampire in over 100 years.
I'd say that's earned him a drink.
Marishka!
[Dracula] Why can't they just leave us alone?
We never kill more than our fill and less than our share.
Can they say the same?
Did I not stress how important it was
to be finished with Anna Valerious
before she destroys what we are trying to create?
-[Aleera] We lost Marishka. -[Verona] Master.
There, there, my darlings. Do not worry.
-I shall find another bride. -What?
-Do we mean so little to you? -Have you no heart?
No, I have no heart! I feel no love!
Nor fear,
nor joy,
nor sorrow!
I am hollow.
And I will live forever.
-My Lord. -It is not so bad.
[Dracula] I am at war with the world
and every living soul in it.
But soon the final battle will begin.
I must go and find out who our new visitor is.
You will have to make a little aperitif out of him.
We are much too close to success to be interrupted now.
[Aleera] No! [Verona] The last experiment was a failure!
Please, say you will not try again.
My heart could not bear the sorrow if we fail again.
Come.
Do not fear me.
Everybody else fears me.
Not my brides.
[Dracula] Igor.
Yes, Master.
Why do you torment that thing so?
It's what I do.
Remember, Igor, "Do unto others..."
Before they do unto me, Master.
Now go, all of you!
To Castle Frankenstein!
[Aleera] Yes, yes, we will try again.
So, how did you get here? We came by sea.
-[Anna] Really? The sea? -[Carl] Well, yes.
[Anna] The Adriatic Sea?
[Van Helsing] So, where do I find Dracula?
[Anna] He used to live in this very house four centuries ago.
No one knows where he lives now.
My father would stare at that painting for hours
looking for Dracula's lair.
-So that's why you've come? -I can help you.
-No one can help me. -I can try.
You can die trying. All of my family has.
-I can handle this myself. -So I noticed.
The vampires attacked in daylight. They never do that.
I was unprepared. It won't happen again.
So why did they attack in daylight?
Clearly they wanted to catch me off guard.
They seem almost desperate to finish off my family.
-Why is that? Why now? -You ask a lot of questions.
Usually I ask only two.
What are we dealing with, and how do I kill it?
My father spent most of his life looking for answers year after year.
Tearing through the tower, combing through the family archives.
-Carl, the tower. Start there. -Right.
The only way to save your family is to stay alive till Dracula's killed.
And who will kill him if not me? Who will show courage if not me?
Go alone and you'll be outmanned and outpositioned.
And you can't see in the dark.
In the morning, we will hunt him
but we'll do it together.
Some say you're a murderer, Mr. Van Helsing.
Others say you're a holy man. Which is it?
[sighing] It's a bit of both, I think.
-I promised you a drink. -Yes, you did.
The bar is down the hall. Help yourself.
As for me, I'm going to finish this once and for all.
I'm sorry you have to carry this burden alone.
On the contrary, I would wish for it no other way.
I'm sorry about your father and brother.
I will see them again.
We Transylvanians always look on the brighter side of death.
-There's a brighter side of death? -Yes. It's just harder to see.
I'm sorry about that, too.
Van Helsing!
Van Helsing?
-Velkan? -Anna.
Oh, my God, you're alive.
No. Anna, I only have a moment.
-But there's a werewolf... -Never mind! Listen to me! I know Dracula's secret. He has a...
I know Dracula's secret. He has a...
-Velkan? -Please.
No! No!
Run, Anna.
[Van Helsing] Anna!
Anna... Are you all right? Anna?
Why does it smell like wet dog in here?
Werewolf!
Oh, right. You'll be needing silver bullets, then.
Well done.
Who's hunting whom?
Nice night. This is a bit tight for me.
But for you it's a perfect fit.
What a coincidence.
I see the wolf man hasn't killed you yet.
Don't worry, he's getting to it.
-You don't seem too bothered by him. -I'm no threat to him.
I'm just the one who cleans up after him,
if you get my meaning.
Little late to be digging graves, isn't it?
Never too late to dig graves.
You never know when you'll need a fresh one.
Oh, sorry. It's just my nature.
-[Van Helsing] Move! -[Anna] No!
-Why? -You're choking me!
-Give me a reason not to. -I can't. If people knew...
He's not your brother anymore, Anna!
Before or after I stopped you from shooting him?
Before.
And still you tried to kill him!
He's a werewolf! He's gonna kill people!
He can't help it! It's not his fault!
I know, but he'll do it anyway!
Do you understand forgiveness?
Yes. I ask for it often.
They say Dracula has a cure.
If there's a chance I can save my brother,
-I'm going after it. -No.
-I need to find Dracula. -And I need to find my brother!
He gave his life for me. He's the only family I have left.
I despise Dracula more than you can ever imagine.
He has taken everything from me, leaving me alone in this world.
To have memories of those you loved and lost
is perhaps harder than to have no memories at all.
All right.
We'll look for your brother.
-Igor. -Yes, Master.
-How long before we are ready? -Soon, Master. Very soon.
It is difficult without the good doctor
but the Dwergi, they are doing well?
[in Hungarian] No!
Good.
[Anna] For me, this is all personal. It's all about family and honor.
Why do you do it, this job of yours? What do you hope to get out of it?
I don't know. Maybe some self-realization.
What have you got out of it so far?
Nightmares.
Werewolves only shed before the first full moon.
Before the curse has completely consumed them.
-[Van Helsing] What is this place? -[Anna] Castle Frankenstein.
But it should be abandoned.
I don't understand.
The man who lived here was killed a year ago.
-A grave robber, among other things. -A year ago.
It was just after that that your father went missing.
Yes. He was looking for Dracula. He was on his way to the sea.
I have never been to the sea.
I'll bet it's beautiful.
Werewolves are such a nuisance during their first full moon.
So hard to control.
I send you on a simple errand
to find out who our new visitor is,
and you have to stop for a little chat with your sister.
Leave her out of this, Count. She doesn't know your secret.
And I am soon to take it to my grave.
Don't wish for death so quickly. I intend for you to be quite useful.
I would rather die than help you.
Don't be boring. Everyone who says that dies.
Besides, tonight,
after the final stroke of midnight,
you will have no choice but to obey me.
Look familiar?
Father?
No!
He proved useless.
But I'm hoping, with werewolf venom running through your veins
you will be of greater benefit!
I may have failed to kill you, Count, but my sister will not.
Never! Never! Never!
-Dwergi. -Dwergi?
Dracula's servants. Industrious but extremely vicious.
If you get the chance to kill one, do it
-because they'll do worse to you. -Right.
They say they're using my brother in some sort of experiment.
My brother is still battling the sickness within him.
-There's still hope. -Anna.
There is no hope for your brother.
But we can still protect others by killing Dracula.
Let us begin!
[in Hungarian] No slacking! Up!
[Anna] No. What do you think they are? Offspring.
[Anna] What?
[Van Helsing] A man with three gorgeous women for 400 years.
Yes, vampires are the walking dead.
It only makes sense their children are born dead.
He's obviously trying to bring them to life.
Ladies first.
Dracula and his brides only kill one or two people a month.
If he brings all these things to life...
-Throw the switches! -[Igor] Yes, Master.
-What are you doing? -I want to see what we're up against.
So this is what you get when vampires mate.
Come on!
They need to feed. Teach them how. Teach them!
And beg the Devil
that this time they stay alive.
-This is where I come in. -No, wait!
Now that I have your attention.
[Carl] Yes, well, that's interesting.
That's not good. Must warn somebody.
I can tell the character of a man by the sound of his heartbeat.
Usually when I approach
I can almost dance to the beat. [clapping]
Strange that yours is so steady.
[Igor in Hungarian] Hurry up!
We must keep the atmosphere electrified!
Accelerate the generators!
Power the dynamos!
We are losing power.
The human is insufficient.
Velkan.
Oh, my God.
Feed, my darlings! Feed!
[in Latin] May he rest in peace.
Hello, Gabriel.
We must not lose the master's progeny!
Is this your silver stake?
How long has it been, 300, 400 years?
You don't remember, do you?
Exactly what is it I should be remembering? You are the great Van Helsing.
You are the great Van Helsing. Trained by monks and mullahs from Tibet to Istanbul.
Trained by monks and mullahs from Tibet to Istanbul.
Protected by Rome herself.
But, like me, hunted by all others.
The Knights of the Holy Order know all about you.
It's no surprise you would know about me.
Yes, but it's much more than this. [laughing]
We have such history, you and I, Gabriel.
Have you ever wondered why you have such horrible nightmares?
Horrific scenes of ancient battles past.
How do you know me?
-Velkan. -Anna.
No, no, no. Don't unstrap me. Don't unstrap me.
No, you must not! No! Stop!
Stop it. I'm getting you out of here.
Velkan, it's all right. I'm taking you home.
So would you like me to refresh your memory a little?
A few details from your sordid past.
Perhaps that is a conversation for another time.
Allow me to reintroduce myself.
I am Count Vladislaus Dragulia.
Born 1422.
Murdered 1462.
Help me!
I think we've overstayed our welcome.
-[man 1] Have you found the children? -[man 2] Not yet.
-What happened? -They just died.
How can I ever repay you?
But you can't do that. You are a monk.
Well, actually I'm just a friar. Hmm.
I am sorry, master. We try and we try,
but I fear we are not so smart as Dr. Frankenstein.
Truly.
It would appear the good doctor took the key to life to his grave.
Hunt them down.
Kill them both.
[Anna] A silver stake? A crucifix?
What, did you think we haven't tried everything before?
We've shot him, stabbed him, clubbed him,
sprayed him with holy water, staked him through the heart,
and still he lives! Do you understand?
No one knows how to kill Dracula.
Well, I could have used that information a little earlier.
Don't give me that look.
You were right. I'm sorry.
He's not my brother anymore.
Do you have any family, Mr. Van Helsing?
Not sure. I hope to find out someday. That's what keeps me going.
-Here's to what keeps you going. -Absinthe. Strong stuff.
Don't let it touch your tongue. It'll knock you on your--
Vampire.
Vampires!
Now I remember.
"Even a man who is pure in heart And says his prayers by night
"may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms
"and the moon is shining bright.
"Or crave another's blood when the sun goes down
"and his body takes to flight"
There's something down here.
And it's carnivorous.
Whatever it is, it appears to be human.
I'd say he's a size 17. Around 360 pounds.
Eight and a half to nine feet tall.
He has a bad gimp in his right leg and three copper teeth.
How do you know he has copper teeth?
Because he's standing right behind you. Move!
Oh, my God! The Frankenstein monster!
Monster? Who's the monster here?
I have done nothing wrong
and yet you and your kind all wish me dead!
What do you want?
To exist.
Don't!
-We must kill it. -Wait.
If you value your lives and the lives of your kind,
-you will kill me. -No.
If Dracula finds me.
I am the key to my father's machine.
The key to life.
Life for Dracula's children.
He already awakened them last night.
Two.
And those were from only one bride.
From one single birthing.
And they died as they did the last time he tried.
Only with me can he give them lasting life.
There are more? More of those things?
Thousands.
Thousands more.
-No. -You heard what he said.
My life, my job is to vanquish evil.
I can, I can sense evil.
This thing, man, whatever it is,
evil may have created it, may have left its mark on it.
But evil does not rule it, so I cannot kill it.
-I can. -Not while I'm here.
Your family has spent 400 years trying to kill Dracula.
Maybe this poor creature can help us find a way.
Oh, my God. He's seen us.
Now they'll come for him,
and neither you nor I will be able to stop them.
If I can get him to Rome, we can protect him there.
And then the painting came alive
and the two creatures attacked each other.
-What does it mean? -I don't know.
Listen, Carl, whatever you do, don't stare at him.
I'm staring at him.
Is that a man?
Actually, it's seven men. Parts of them, anyway.
By exposing me, you have condemned me!
Me and all of humanity!
Nothing is faster than Transylvanian horses.
Not even a werewolf.
Anything else, you're on your own.
-Let me go. -Where are you going to go?
I don't know if you've looked in the mirror lately,
but you kind of stick out in a crowd.
We must not let the creature be destroyed!
[Aleera] Save him! Save the monster!
Stakes!
No!
-[Anna] Carl! -[Carl] Oh, my God.
-[Carl] What are you doing out here? -[Anna] Carl! [Carl] Right, right.
Don't let go!
I can help!
You won't kill me?
Only if you don't hurry!
Jump!
Anna.
Forgive me.
I will see you again.
You killed him. You killed him.
Now you know why they call me murderer.
Oh, my God.
You've been bitten.
So much trouble to my master. So much trouble.
What do you want?
The master commands a trade.
The monster for the Princess.
Somewhere public. Lots of people.
A place where your master will be less inclined
to expose his other side.
Tomorrow night is All Hallows' Eve.
Here in Budapest, there is a wonderful masquerade ball.
-Are you all right? -No.
He has been bitten.
Bitten by a werewolf.
Now you will become that which you have hunted so passionately.
I am sorry.
May others be as passionate in their hunting of you.
Well, they won't find him in here.
I'm sure this is some sort of sin.
Don't worry, God will forgive us. We need to save Anna.
You don't think the hat's a bit much, do you?
-Carl, help me! -Oh, right.
How many commandments can we break in one day?
Anyway, according to the book
you won't turn into a werewolf until the rising of your first full moon.
That's two nights from now.
Even then, you'll still be able to fight Dracula's hold over you
until the final stroke of midnight.
Sounds like I have nothing to worry about.
My God, you should be terrified.
-[Van Helsing] Thank you. -Sorry.
Well, we still have 48 hours to find a solution.
You sure he can't get out of there?
Not without some help from the dead.
How does it feel to be a puppet on my string?
I won't let you trade me, Count.
I have no intention of trading you.
And if I know Van Helsing, which I do,
he is not planning on making a trade, either.
Neither of us has ever settled for half.
Ah, there they are.
You make my skin crawl.
This is not all I could do with your skin.
Carl, I need you to do something.
I'm not gonna like this, am I?
Don't we make a lovely couple?
Oh, my God.
I am looking for a new bride, Anna.
Someone strong and beautiful.
One brief moment of pain,
and we can be together forever.
You have no heartbeat.
Perhaps it just needs
to be rekindled.
Wake up.
[Dracula] Gabriel.
Welcome to my summer palace.
Master, Master! Look, Master, look!
We have him, Master. We have him.
You wretched undead!
I shall have my revenge!
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
"I shall fear no evil!"
You are nothing but damned bones
and damned souls,
and will burn in the flames of Hell!
Now that everything is as it should be,
ladies and gentlemen, I give to you,
Van Helsing!
Come on.
Come on!
Yes!
Now I know what it's for.
-Where are we going? -[both] Through that window!
Carl, you're a genius!
A genius with access to unstable chemicals.
Say goodbye to your friends.
I'll find you! I'll get you back and set you free!
I swear to God!
-I must save him. -No, you can't.
Why?
I cabled Rome earlier to apprise them of our situation.
-What did they say? -Even if you somehow kill Dracula,
Rome orders you to destroy Frankenstein as well.
He isn't evil.
Yes, but they say he isn't human, either.
Do they know him? Have they talked with him? Who are they to judge?
They want you to destroy him so he can never be used to harm humanity.
And what of me? Did you tell them what I'm to become?
Did they tell you how to kill me?
The correct angle of the stake -as it enters my heart? -[Anna] No!
The exact measure of silver in each bullet? Huh?
-[Anna] Stop! -No, I left you out!
I'm sorry.
It's starting.
[Anna] They must have taken all the equipment to Dracula's lair.
Wherever that is.
Look, there's still time.
Dracula can't bring his children to life until the sun sets.
The sun sets in two hours.
We've been looking for him for more than 400 years!
Yes, well, I wasn't around for those 400 years, now, was I?
[Van Helsing] All right, Carl, what have you learned?
That Count Dracula was actually the son of Valerious the Elder.
The son of your ancestor.
Everybody knows that. What else?
All right. Well, according to this rubbing
it all started when Dracula was murdered.
-Do you know who murdered him? -No, no, no,
there's just some vague reference to the Left Hand of God.
And in 1462, when Dracula died,
-he made a covenant with the Devil. -And was given a new life.
But the only way he could sustain that life was by drinking the blood of others.
Excuse me. Are you going to let me tell the story?
[both] Sorry.
And your ancestor, having sired this evil creature,
went to Rome to seek forgiveness. That's when the bargain was made.
He was to kill Dracula
in return for eternal salvation of his entire family
right down the line, all the way to you.
[Anna] But he couldn't do it.
As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor couldn't kill his own son.
So he banished him to an icy fortress
sending him through a door from which there was no return.
-And then the Devil gave him wings. -Yes.
-All right, so where is this door? -I don't know.
But when your ancestor couldn't kill his son, he left clues.
So that future generations might do it for him.
That must be what my father was looking for in here.
Clues to the door's location.
The door.
The door. Of course.
You said your father spent hours
staring at this painting, trying to find Dracula's lair.
I think you were right. Quite literally. I think this is the door. He just didn't know how to open it.
I think this is the door. He just didn't know how to open it.
Look. A Latin inscription.
Maybe it works like that painting in the tower.
If this were a door, my father would have opened it long ago.
I can't finish the inscription. There's a piece missing.
-Your father didn't have this. -Where did you get that?
Carl, finish it.
In the name of God, open this door.
A mirror.
Dracula has no reflection in the mirror.
But why?
Maybe, maybe to Dracula it's not a mirror at all.
It's cold. And it's snowing.
See you on the other side.
Be careful.
Castle Dracula.
[Carl] Do we have a plan?
It doesn't have to be Wellington's at Waterloo,
but some sort of plan would be nice. [Van Helsing] We're going to go in there and stop Dracula.
[Van Helsing] We're going to go in there and stop Dracula.
[Anna] And kill anything that gets in our way.
[Carl] Well, you let me know how that goes.
Well, as grateful as I am to be out of the cold,
that doesn't seem like a good thing.
We'd better get moving.
-[Carl] So are all of those-- -[Anna] Yes.
-[Carl] And inside them are-- -[Van Helsing] Yes.
[Igor] Igor do this! Igor do that!
How did you find... It's impossible!
-Please don't kill me! -Why not?
Well, I...
My master has awakened.
-There is a cure. -What?
Dracula. He has a cure to remove the curse of the werewolf!
Go, find the cure! Save yourself!
Come on. You heard him. Let's find it.
Wait. Why does Dracula have a cure?
-I don't care! -I do.
Why does he need one? Why?
Because the only thing that can kill him is a werewolf.
The painting. That's what it meant.
But Dracula's been using werewolves to do his bidding for centuries.
Yes, but if one ever had the will to turn on him, he'd need a cure to remove the curse and make him human before it bit him.
to remove the curse and make him human before it bit him.
You're going to take these two
-and lead them to the antidote. -No, I'm not.
Yes, I am.
Here's the plan. When the bell begins to toll midnight,
you'll be able to kill Dracula.
We just need to find the cure
and get it into you before the final stroke. Are you insane? What kind of plan is that?
Are you insane? What kind of plan is that?
If they even suspect you of misleading them...
Clip off one of his fingers.
-I'll clip off something. -The tower over there,
-that's where it is. -And what about the other tower?
-Give me that! -That is where
we reassembled the laboratory. Would I lie to you?
Not if you wanted to live.
Now, if I'm not cured by the twelfth stroke of midnight...
-I don't think I could. -You must.
Come on.
I don't like this plan.
We don't have a choice. Just don't get killed.
You still don't understand.
It doesn't matter what happens to me.
We must save my family.
If you're late, run like hell.
Don't be late.
[whispering] Now go. Go. Go.
[monster] Get off me, you vermin from hell!
What are you complaining about? This is why you were made!
To prove that God is not the only one who can create life!
And now you must give that life to my children.
Up!
There it is.
I'll go first.
[Anna] Carl!
Stay as long as you like.
You try to get Igor. Igor get you! [laughing]
-Go ahead. Grab it. -You go ahead and grab it.
If there's one thing I've learned
it's never to be the first to stick your hand in a viscous material.
-Did I scare you? -No.
Then maybe I need to try a little harder.
Viscous material! What did I tell you?
Get it! Get it!
Ooh, hot. Hot, hot, hot.
-Come on! -Yes.
We've got to get the antidote to Van Helsing! Go! Go!
You can't go until I say you can go!
Keep running, Carl!
Come here! And I'll say you can go when you're dead!
[Carl] Oh, my God!
What are you doing? You must find the cure!
-My friends are doing it for me. -Friends.
Yes. You want one?
I can't unscrew the bolts. This is gonna hurt.
I am accustomed to pain.
It lets you know you're alive.
Give me life!
One more bolt and my young will live.
[Van Helsing] You're almost out, my friend!
Help me!
But you're supposed to die.
I want to live.
All right!
Be happy in the knowledge
that I shall weep over your dead body.
Hang on!
I'll swing you loose!
You are too late, my friend.
My children live.
Then the only way to kill them is to kill you.
Correct.
So be it.
One.
No, this cannot be.
We are both part of the same grand game, Gabriel.
But we need not find ourselves on opposite sides of the board.
[monster] Go! Go and help Van Helsing!
Now!
Thank you.
Oh, my God! Anna, I need a little help!
Hurry!
Throw it to me, Carl!
You are being used, Gabriel, as was I.
But I escaped. So can you.
Anna, my love,
it is your blood that shall keep me beautiful.
What do you think of that?
I think if you're going to kill someone, kill them.
Don't stand there talking about it.
Don't you understand?
We could be friends. Partners!
Brothers-in-arms!
Did I mention that it was you who murdered me?
It must be such a burden. Such a curse
to be the Left Hand of God.
All I want is life, Gabriel.
The continuation of my kind.
And perhaps the return of my ring.
Don't be afraid, Gabriel. Don't be afraid.
I shall give you back your life, your memory.
Some things are better left forgotten. [groaning]
For God!
God forgive me.
She's dead.
[Carl in Latin] "Eternal rest grant unto her,
Oh, Lord, and let perpetual light
shine upon her. On her soul and the souls of all
THE KING AND QUEEN WERE BLESSED WITH A BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL.

I TOLD YOU COMING HERE WAS A BAD IDEA.
YOU COULD HAVE TRIED TO GET ALONG WITH MY FATHER.
SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK I WAS GOING TO GET DADDY'S BLESSING, EVEN IF I DID WANT IT.
DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE NICE IF SOMEBODY ASKED ME WHAT I WANTED?
SURE. DO YOU WANT ME TO PACK FOR YOU?
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE! YOU'RE BEHAVING LIKE A...
- GO ON! SAY IT! - LIKE AN OGRE!
HERE'S A NEWS FLASH FOR YOU!
WHETHER YOUR PARENTS LIKE IT OR NOT... I AM AN OGRE!

I'VE MADE CHANGES FOR YOU, SHREK. THINK ABOUT THAT.
THAT'S REAL SMOOTH, SHREK. "I'M AN OGRE!"
I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN. [LILLIAN] YOU SHOULD. YOU STARTED IT.
I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE THAT, LILLIAN. HE'S THE OGRE. NOT ME.
I THINK, HAROLD... YOU'RE TAKING THIS A LITTLE TOO PERSONALLY.
THIS IS FIONA'S CHOICE.
BUT SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO CHOOSE THE PRINCE WE PICKED FOR HER.
I MEAN, YOU EXPECT ME TO GIVE MY BLESSINGS TO THIS... THIS... THING?
FIONA DOES. AND SHE'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU IF YOU DON'T.
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE OUR DAUGHTER AGAIN, HAROLD.
OH, YOU ACT AS IF LOVE IS TOTALLY PREDICTABLE.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE YOUNG
AND WE USED TO WALK DOWN BY THE LILY POND AND...
- THEY WERE IN BLOOM... - OUR FIRST KISS.
IT'S NOT THE SAME!
I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE THAT OUR DAUGHTER HAS MARRIED A MONSTER!
OH, STOP BEING SUCH A DRAMA KING.

YOU REMEMBER MY SON, PRINCE CHARMING?
IS THAT YOU? MY GOSH! IT'S BEEN YEARS.
IS THAT YOU? MY GOSH! IT'S BEEN YEARS. WHEN DID YOU GET BACK?
OH, ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AGO, ACTUALLY.
AFTER I ENDURED BLISTERING WINDS, SCORCHING DESERT...
I CLIMBED TO THE HIGHEST ROOM IN THE TALLEST TOWER...
MOMMY CAN HANDLE THIS.
HE ENDURES BLISTERING WINDS AND SCORCHING DESERT!
HE CLIMBS TO THE HIGHEST BLOODY ROOM OF THE TALLEST BLOODY TOWER... AND WHAT DOES HE FIND?

THIS ISN'T A GOOD TIME, PUMPKIN. MAMA'S WORKING.
WHOA, WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
THE OGRE, THAT'S WHAT!
WHAT? WHERE IS HE, MOM?
I SHALL REND HIS HEAD FROM HIS SHOULDERS!
I WILL SMITE HIM WHERE HE STANDS!
HE WILL RUE THE VERY DAY HE STOLE MY KINGDOM FROM ME!
OH, PUT IT AWAY, JUNIOR! YOU'RE STILL GOING TO BE KING.
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING SMARTER.
PARDON. UM... EVERYTHING IS ACCOUNTED FOR, FAIRY GODMOTHER, EXCEPT FOR ONE POTION.
EVERYTHING IS ACCOUNTED FOR, FAIRY GODMOTHER, EXCEPT FOR ONE POTION. WHAT?
OH... I DO BELIEVE WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK TO OUR ADVANTAGE.
"HAPPILY EVER AFTER POTION. MAXIMUM STRENGTH.
"FOR YOU AND YOUR TRUE LOVE.
"IF ONE OF YOU DRINKS THIS, YOU BOTH WILL BE FINE.
"HAPPINESS, COMFORT AND BEAUTY DIVINE."
- YOU BOTH WILL BE FINE? - I GUESS IT'LL AFFECT FIONA.
MAN, THIS DON'T FEEL RIGHT. MY DONKEY SENSES ARE TINGLING ALL OVER.
MAN, THIS DON'T FEEL RIGHT. MY DONKEY SENSES ARE TINGLING ALL OVER. DROP THAT JUG O' VOODOO AND LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

SEE, YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO THAT STUFF. YOU'LL HAVE A REACTION.
YOU'LL HAVE A REACTION. AND IF YOU THINK I'LL SMEAR VAPOR RUB OVER YOUR CHEST, THINK AGAIN!
BOSS, JUST IN CASE THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE POTION...

IT WOULD BE AN HONOR TO LAY MY LIFE ON THE LINE FOR YOU.
OH, NO, NO. I DON'T THINK SO. IF THERE'LL BE ANY ANIMAL TESTING, I'LL DO IT.
THAT'S THE BEST FRIEND'S JOB. NOW GIVE ME THAT BOTTLE.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?
I DON'T FEEL ANY DIFFERENT. I LOOK ANY DIFFERENT? YOU STILL LOOK LIKE AN ASS TO ME.
YOU STILL LOOK LIKE AN ASS TO ME.
MAYBE IT DOESN'T WORK ON DONKEYS.

- NO MORE WALLOWING IN THE MUD? - I KNOW.
- NO MORE ITCHY BUTT CRACK? - I KNOW!
- BUT YOU LOVE BEING AN OGRE! - I KNOW!
BUT I LOVE FIONA MORE.
SHREK, NO! WAIT!
GOT TO BE... I THINK YOU GRABBED THE "FARTY EVER AFTER" POTION.
MAYBE IT'S A DUD.
OR MAYBE FIONA AND I WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE.
UH-OH. WHAT DID I TELL YOU? I FEEL SOMETHING COMING ON.
I DON'T WANT TO DIE. I DON'T WANT TO DIE.
I DON'T WANT TO DIE! OH, SWEET SISTER, MOTHER OF MERCY. I'M MELTING!

YOU WANT TO DANCE, PRETTY BOY?
ARE YOU GOING SO SOON? DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR WIFE?
SHREK? AYE, FIONA. IT IS ME.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR VOICE?
THE POTION CHANGED A LOT OF THINGS, FIONA.
BUT NOT THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT YOU.
FIONA?
CHARMING?
DO YOU THINK SO? [LAUGHS] DAD? I WAS SO HOPING YOU'D APPROVE.
- UM... WHO ARE YOU? - MOM, IT'S ME, SHREK.
I KNOW YOU NEVER GET A SECOND CHANCE AT A FIRST IMPRESSION
BUT, WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- FIONA! - FIONA, FIONA! HO-HO-HO! OH, SHOOT! I DON'T THINK THEY CAN HEAR US, PIGEON.
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'VE ALREADY MESSED HER LIFE UP ENOUGH?
I JUST WANTED HER TO BE HAPPY.
AND NOW SHE CAN BE.
OH, SWEETHEART.
SHE'S FINALLY FOUND THE PRINCE OF HER DREAMS.
BUT LOOK AT ME. LOOK WHAT I'VE DONE FOR HER.
IT'S TIME YOU STOP LIVING IN A FAIRY TALE, SHREK.
SHE'S A PRINCESS. AND YOU'RE AN OGRE.
THAT'S SOMETHING NO AMOUNT OF POTION WILL EVER CHANGE.
BUT... I LOVE HER.

HEY. WHY THE LONG FACE?
IT WAS ALL JUST A STUPID MISTAKE.
I NEVER SHOULD'VE RESCUED HER FROM THAT TOWER IN THE FIRST PLACE.
I HATE MONDAYS.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE WALKING AWAY FROM THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO YOU.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?
SHE LOVES THAT PRETTY BOY, PRINCE CHARMING.
COME ON. IS HE REALLY THAT GOOD-LOOKING?
ARE YOU KIDDING? HE'S GORGEOUS!
HE HAS A FACE THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS CARVED BY ANGELS.
OH. HE SOUNDS DREAMY.
SHOCKINGLY, THIS ISN'T MAKING ME FEEL ANY BETTER.
LOOK, GUYS. IT'S FOR THE BEST.
MOM AND DAD APPROVE, AND FIONA GETS THE MAN SHE'S ALWAYS DREAMED OF.
EVERYBODY WINS.
EXCEPT FOR YOU.
I DON'T GET IT, SHREK. YOU LOVE FIONA. AYE.
AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO LET HER GO.
EXCUSE ME, IS SHE HERE?
SHE'S ER... IN THE BACK.
OH, HELLO AGAIN.
FAIRY GODMOTHER. CHARMING.
OH. YOU'D BETTER HAVE A GOOD REASON FOR DRAGGING US DOWN HERE.
WELL, I'M AFRAID FIONA ISN'T REALLY... WARMING UP TO PRINCE CHARMING.
- FYI, NOT MY FAULT. - NO, OF COURSE IT'S NOT, DEAR.
I MEAN, HOW CHARMING CAN I BE, WHEN I HAVE TO PRETEND I'M THAT DREADFUL OGRE?
NO, NO, IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.
PERHAPS IT'S BEST IF WE JUST CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF. OK?
- WHAT? - YOU CAN'T FORCE SOMEONE TO FALL IN LOVE.
I BEG TO DIFFER. I DO IT ALL THE TIME!
HAVE FIONA DRINK THIS AND SHE'LL FALL IN LOVE WITH THE FIRST MAN SHE KISSES. WHICH WILL BE CHARMING.
WHICH WILL BE CHARMING.
- UM... NO. - WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I CAN'T. I WON'T DO IT.
OH, YES, YOU WILL.
IF YOU REMEMBER, I HELPED YOU WITH YOUR HAPPILY EVER AFTER.
AND I CAN TAKE IT AWAY JUST AS EASILY.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? IS IT?
- NO. - GOOD BOY.
NOW, WE HAVE TO GO.
I NEED TO DO CHARMING'S HAIR BEFORE THE BALL.

WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT? ARE YOU SERIOUS? - [COOING] - [GASPING]
Tell him the ice cream man is here.
Freeze. Hammer time.
Can we get down to business?
You got the money?
Tell him.
He said that he's not gonna give you one red cent...
until you tell him what flavor the ice cream is.
Vanilla. That's what you ordered.
-Tell him. -Okay.
It's all about the Benjamins, baby!
Bring in the stuff.
-Arnold Schwarzenegger, funny man! -He's funny like that!
There is your ice cream.
Tell him. I see coming. He say....
I tell him, I say Jesús.
He coming, and he say....
-Tell him. -He say...
FBI. You're under arrest.
-He's going to run. -No, he ain't.
You owe me $1.
Where are you going, big boy?
Goddamn. Now I'm going to bust your ass.
Is that all your big ass got?
-Enough. -Kevin.
All right, you two over here. Right now.
I swear I'll shoot both of you.
Damn, Marcus, why you always got to pick the biggest dude?
I don't know. I like a challenge.
See, what did I tell you?
We did it, right? Didn't I tell you?
-No help. No backup. -You the man.
We'll get all the credit. The biggest bust of our career.
400 keys of pure....
-Vanilla ice cream? -What?
My man! Where's the drugs?
I know nothing about drugs.
I sell ice cream. Strawberry. Vanilla.
Neapolitan, for example.
Tell Manny his ice cream delivery is here.
Never mind. Wrong store.
FBI. Freeze!
-Marcus? -I'm good.
-They're moving. -Let's go.
-Which one? -I don't know.
-God. -Damn.
I told you we should've called for backup.
You know the Chief's gonna kill us, right?
Let me give you guys a little tip.
If you're going to operate outside the channels...
do the whole renegade cop thing...
you might want to make sure that you get the right guy.
Chief, we almost had the guy.
Our intelligence was just a little off.
Wait a minute. Intelligence?
Look around you, Copeland. There's nothing intelligent about this.
Now I'm tired of your escapades. I want them to stop.
The last thing I need is to be the laughingstock of the Bureau.
And furthermore, the--
Hold on. Hello? Baby, I can't talk.
The Chief is chewing my ass right now. I got to call you back. Bye.
-Sorry, Chief. -As I was saying--
Gordon here.
Yes, he is.
-It's for you. -Thank you.
-Baby, I'm still with the Chief. -No respect.
No, he's really not happy now.
Okay, I got to go. Bye. Thanks, Chief.
You guys are.... Get this place cleaned up.
I expect to have a full report on my desk tomorrow.
-Yes, sir. -And in the meantime...
I'm checking with the Bureau to see if they got any openings...
in Iraq.
The Dynamic Duo strikes again. Way to go, Baskin and Robbin.
Or is it Häag and Dazs?
Häag and Dazs. You wrote that?
That's good, I like that.
-Later, Häag. -Adiós, Dazs.
-I hate those guys, dude. -Oh, God.
All right. Well, let's get this place cleaned up.
-All right. -Okay, so, you do the floor.
Clean all the ice cream up and I'll go warm the car up.
Okay. So much for a hot meal.
-Hey, baby. -Don't "hey, baby" me.
I can't believe you have me sitting here all night worried about you.
All night? Baby...
it's only 8:00.
Look, after work, me and Kevin... went down to the bar and had a couple of drinks.
went down to the bar and had a couple of drinks.
I know. I called the bar. They said you left at 7:45.
I checked MapQuest. It only takes six minutes to get there from here.
So, if you got somebody on the side, you need to tell me.
Baby, listen to what you just say.
MapQuest said it takes six minutes to get here. I got here in eight.
Which means there's two minutes unaccounted for.
If I was cheating on you, don't you think I'd need more than two minutes?
You know what? I ain't going to deal with this.
I'm tired, okay? I had a long day at work. I got shot at.
See, that is exactly what I'm talking about.
We don't communicate.
-Okay, fine. You want to communicate? -Yes.
Come on. Let's communicate. Okay?
Okay. Let's start with last week.
Last week.
You and I were supposed to go shopping together. We get to the mall.
I buy this beautiful dress, I get my hair done.
You don't say anything. I don't know, maybe you just don't want to....
Marcus!
Did you hear me just now?
Tell me what I said.
I heard everything. You was communicating.
Don't play with me right now. I am not in the mood.
I cannot believe you came home late and then you start....
Marcus! You are falling asleep again. I am talking to you.
I wasn't asleep, I was closing my eyes and visualizing your words.
Oh, really? Visualizing?
Why don't you paint me a picture of what I just said?
-Hold on. -You know why?
Because you are falling asleep again. Marcus!
We received this from Mr. Andrew Wilson, CEO of Wilson Cruise Lines.
It was delivered to his home. The girls in the photo are his daughters...
and heiresses to the Wilson fortune.
We believe they are the kidnapper's next victims.
Mr. Wilson has given us permission to shadow his daughters.
We're going to set up surveillance...
and if the kidnapper strikes...
this time we will be ready.
Now, the Wilson sisters will be flying into JFK this morning.
So who's going to pick them up?
Okay. Obviously, everyone has read the profile on the girls.
Still, somebody's got to do it.
I don't think this is a good idea.
I don't care. We deserve to be on this case just as much as Gomez and Harper.
I know, but we don't want to interrupt the man in a briefing.
Well, somebody got to stand up to him.
-Chief. -What?
-Marcus has something to tell you. -What?
Chief, we just want to know if we could get on the case.
You're on.
The boys over at Intel seem to think that the kidnapper's a guy...
named Ted Burton.
It says Burton was a partner of Wilson's... and some other associates in some business venture that failed.
and some other associates in some business venture that failed.
Says he spent time in the Federal pen and lost his fortune.
Guy's been MIA since his release...
and those dates coincide with the first kidnappings.
-What do you think? -I think this babysitting gig sucks.
Dude, relax.
Look, man. All we got to do is pick these chicks up... drop their ass off in the Hamptons, then we back in the Chief's good graces.
drop their ass off in the Hamptons, then we back in the Chief's good graces.
I didn't join the FBI to become a nanny.
I want to be on the street where the action is.
Okay, Blackie Chan, and you'll get there. Can we just do this first, please?
-All right. -You didn't put dairy in this, did you?
-No. -Because you know I'm lactose intolerant.
Last time, I barely made it to the bathroom.
Why would I want to disturb your stomach?
There goes your girls.
Come on, man. Let's do this.
Hi, I'm Kevin Copeland. This is--
We already gave to the United Negro Fund.
-Wait. Hold on. -Excuse us.
We're actually here to escort you ladies to the Hamptons.
The bags are on the plane. Take Baby and clean out his bag.
He didn't have his colonic and he like pooped everywhere.
-What's this? -Baby got to ride in the car seat.
Where the hell am I supposed to sit?
This ain't right.
Man, you guys sure got a lot of bags for a weekend.
-This isn't a weekend. -It's the weekend.
Labor Day in the Hamptons. The last weekend of the social season.
Only the hottest people are going to be there.
And only the hottest of the hottest are going to make it onto the cover...
of Hamptons Magazine. And this is our year.
Open the window. Baby likes a little fresh breeze.
I just hope the Vandergeld sisters' private jet crashes on the way there.
-Oh, my God, Brittany! -You were thinking it!
-I know, but you said it. -I know.
You know Heather totally hates you because you slept with her boyfriend.
My God. So what? I sleep with everyone's boyfriend.
Is everybody all right?
My God! Your lip.
My God! Your nose.
Marcus, are you okay?
-I'm cool. -Baby's in a wreck!
I can't believe...
you think we're going to go to the Hamptons with my face looking like that.
It's really not that bad. Just get some makeup and cover it up.
Put makeup on this?
I am so fricking pissed.
My God, this is like the worst day of my life.
I went to go get my brows done...
and I told her to make me look like J-Lo.
And then that fricking Russian toad made me look...
like Liza Minnelli or something.
Oh, my God! I'm going to have a B.F.
Wait. What's a B.F.?
She's going to have a bitch fit!
-You better get out of here. -I am going to call your boss.
-You don't have to do that. -No, I'll call the owner of the company.
Come on, just take it easy. Look, we can work this out.
-I'm going to write a letter. -No.
Please don't write a letter. Look, just calm down.
You guys just stay here. Stay here the whole weekend.
Do whatever you want. But whatever you do, do not leave this room.
Don't leave this room, because if you do,
everyone's gonna see those hideous scars.
Scar?
-My God! Permanent damage. -My life is over.
If I lose this job with these good benefits, Gina's gonna kill me.
-Well? -They won't go.
-What do you mean, they won't go? -They won't go.
Marcus, this weekend in the Hamptons means everything for these girls.
They won't show up with a scratched-up nose and a busted lip for nobody.
Okay.
That's cool.
What are you doing?
I'm just gonna kill myself before the Chief does.
-Bye-bye, Kevin. -Come on.
Don't do that. Stop being ridiculous.
I'm not being ridiculous. You heard the man.
One more screw-up, and we're through.
-I know, man. -See? That's probably him right now.
Hey, what's up, Chief?
There's something me and Kevin want to tell you. Yeah, Chief? Hey.
Yeah, Chief? Hey.
Me and Marcus just wanted to thank you for the opportunity, man.
No, we didn't.
Yeah, we really appreciate it.
They wanted to stop off and get something to eat.
He's lying to--
Two, three hours max.
Trust me.
If I don't have them there in three hours...
I'll cut them off and mail them to you myself.
-All right, take care. Bye. -He lied, Chief.
Why did you do that? You know them girls aren't going to be there.
They'll be there.
Hey, Josh.
How'd you like to be part of the team?
Where are the white women at?
Let's do this.
He's right. Make them bigger.
Chief. They're here.
All right, the girls are yours. Stick with them. Don't blow your cover.
Yes, sir.
-Are you sure this is going to work? -Just trust me. Follow my lead.
What's up, money? You got a problem? What you looking at my ass for?
No, yo, hold my poodle.
What's up? Y'all got a problem? Y'all want some of this?
You want some of this, punk? What, boy?
-I'll take the both of you. -Cut it out.
-He was looking at my ass like I'm a girl. -You are a girl!
And you better start acting like one or you're going to be an unemployed girl.
Damn. I'd sure like to cut that cake.
Here, yo, hold this!
Hey, you trying to look at my lumps?
I'll pull off my G-string and handle mine.
-I'll handle mine. -Kevin, it's Gomez.
Welcome to the Royal Hamptons Hotel.
-The bags are in the car, José. -The name is Gomez.
-Whatever. -Yeah, great. Here. Take Baby.
Clean out his bag. Poor thing just pooped everywhere.
And teach him how to say, "Quiero Taco Bell."
-Thanks a lot, Rico Suave. Grazie. -Thanks, Julio.
Right away, ma'am.
Sweetie, you've got to slow up with those Cosmos.
Brittany and Tiffany Wilson, checking in.
Sorry. They're new.
-Dr. Dorfman did an amazing job. -They feel so real.
Hi. Yeah, I just... I need a credit card, please.
And some ID, please.
Credit card? ID?
I'm so fricking pissed.
-Ma'am, I-- -First of all...
I go to Dr. Dorfman. He totally messes up my nose job.
I ask him to make me look like Gwyneth Paltrow.
I get off the surgery table looking like freaking Shrek.
Then I get here, and Mr. Harper... makes me feel like I'm some dumb blonde with fake boobs...
makes me feel like I'm some dumb blonde with fake boobs...
going to a Hugh Hefner party.
No. I didn't mean to offend you.
-It's just protocol. -I'm going to have a B.F.
My God. She's going to have a bitch fit.
No. Don't have a B.F. now--
I want to speak to your supervisor. Better yet, I'm going to write a letter.
-Miss, there's no reason to-- -You are in big trouble.
"Dear Mr...
"Royal Hampton.
"I am a white woman... -"in America." -Ladies, is there a problem here?
-"in America." -Ladies, is there a problem here?
-Yes. -No.
There's no problem.
These are two of our VIP guests.
Issue them keys. Immediately.
Yes, sir.
VIP. Learn your acronyms.
-What a sweetheart. -Here you are. Enjoy your stay.
Has anyone ever told you you look just like Denzel Washington?
Yes, actually I have heard it once or twice.
What a beautiful chocolate man.
Beautiful. God.
-That was close. -Yeah.
-Are they waving at us? -I don't know.
-What are we going to do? -Just act friendly.
My God.
Hi.
Well, don't act like you don't know us.
Karen, Lisa, Tori.
Oh, my God.
I haven't seen you in forever.
It's only been a year.
Did you do something different to your hair?
-No. -You gain weight?
-No. -I know! You just had a birthday.
-Yeah. -Totally. Total fire sign. I knew it.
-I totally knew it. -Wait a minute.
There is definitely...
something different about the two of you.
Collagen.
You little witch. How did you know?
Duh, it's totally obvious. Your lips went from Cameron Diaz to Jay-Z.
You got taller, too.
We got our knees done.
You can do that?
-You should do that. -Yes.
Well, it was really good seeing you ladies. Bye.
Excuse me. Where do you think you're going?
To go freshen up.
The Hamptons Magazine reception just started, so let's hit it.
Hey, check it out.
Are those the Wilson sisters?
More like the Wilt Chamberlain sisters. I never noticed how big they are.
But I'd still bone.
My God. There's Heath.
Dude, are you hitting Karen Googlestein, the soap heiress, too?
How do you keep that shit dangling?
I keep telling her I'm going to break up with my girl.
You better hope Heather doesn't find out.
She won't.
At least until I wrap up this big deal with her father.
Hey, Mr. V.
And look, there they are. The fen-phen twins.
They're hot.
What, are you blind?
That's Heather and Megan Vandergeld.
Your sworn enemies since you were like, I don't know, 8?
Did I say hot? I meant not.
-I totally hate them. -Did you guys hear about Megan?
She got stopped by security at Saks trying to pull a Winona.
God. Come on.
-This is going to be fun. -Move.
Look who just flew in from the slums of Beverly Hills.
It's The Beverly Ho-billies.
-Squeeze me? -No, you didn't.
I'm sorry, but we just saw your new video.
They had a screening over at Saks Fifth Avenue...
in the security office.
A klept-ho-maniac.
Your mother shops at Saks.
What?
My God. You want to talk about mothers?
You want to talk about mothers.
It's mother time. Okay.
Your mother's so dumb she went to Dr. Dre for a Pap smear.
"Something's wrong, Dr. Dre. My coochie's doing a beatbox."
Yeah? Well, your mother is so stupid...
she exercises when she could just get... liposuction or something.
Your mother's so old that her breast milk is powdered. You breast-feed like this.
Your mother is so, like....
She's so....
Megan, you go.
Your mother is so stupid...
that she goes to Barneys Rooftop Deck Restaurant for lunch...
and orders a niçoise salad and calls it a "ni-coise" salad.
"Ni-coise" salad, right?
Your mother's ass is so hairy...
it looks like Don King's about to pop out and say, "Only in America!"
Your mother's so stupid... that she goes into Gucci and she tries to buy, like, Fendi and stuff.
that she goes into Gucci and she tries to buy, like, Fendi and stuff.
Megan, Heather. Come on now, girls. Is this any way to speak to your guests?
Brittany and Tiffany Wilson.
I haven't seen you since you were smaller.
Yeah. Well, we're all grown up now.
Yeah, I can see that.
Ladies, I fully expect to see you later at the White Party.
-I think it's gonna be the best one ever. -We'll be there.
-Take care. Bye. Good seeing you again. -Bye, Mr. V.
This isn't over yet.
This is a long weekend. You better watch your back.
-Ladies. -Whatever.
I can't believe you guys just did that to the Vandergelds.
You know, they could take you off the scene just like that.
-Yeah, but it was so cool, you guys. -So cool.
Isn't that Denise Porter from NY1 News?
Yeah, I'm working on getting you an interview with her.
Great for your image.
I think I'll go over there and introduce myself.
-Do you think now's a good time? -Actually, it's a perfect time.
-Wouldn't want to miss a photo op. -Never that.
-See you later. -Have fun.
-What's wrong? Did you just get cramps? -Yeah.
-Do you need a tamp? -Heating pad?
-Hors d'oeuvres? -Thank you, Wolfgang Paco.
Would you give that to Baby? Thank you.
-Bye, Chico. Vamonos. -Bon appétit.
I'll have one.
-Hi, my name is-- -Brittany Wilson, of course.
Yeah. How'd you know? Brittany Wilson.
Well, it's my job to know.
Your publicist, Tori, has been calling me nonstop about setting up an interview.
If I would've known you were so beautiful, I probably would've called you myself.
Well, if I wasn't mistaken, I'd think you were flirting with me, Miss Wilson.
Me? Flirting with you? A girl? Never.
Sorry, honey. Only beef.
-Boy, you're really strong, aren't you? -It's from all that protein.
My God. These are delicious.
You might want to slow down on the cheese.
You mean, there's cheese, as in dairy cheese?
Yeah. Unless you know another way to make quiche.
-Ladies, I think I got to go to the bathroom. -Good. We'll come with.
No, I can handle it myself. Thank you, though.
Like we're going to let you go alone.
Time for touchups anyway.
Move, bitch.
My God, you guys. Heath is here. What should I do?
I don't understand what you see in him.
He's an out-of-work actor living in a share house.
And he drives a 3 Series BMW.
Tori, I really think that you need to cut Heath a little bit of slack.
His aunt died three years ago and he really needs new headshots.
He's just going through a really rough time right now. Okay?
You okay?
Everything all right in there?
It's fine. Shit.
Tiff, we're just going to meet you outside. Okay?
Okay.
Love you.
Man, it may be summertime in the Hamptons...
but it is snowing up in here.
Tony, hand me my boots because I'm about to go skiing.
-Great game last night, Latrell. -That's what I do, baby.
Now that's what I'm talking about.
A white girl with a black girl's ass.
I'm taking that home to Mama.
Pardon me.
Santa must've come early this year...
because you were first on my Christmas list.
There it is, right there.
I want to know. Are you naughty or nice?
Sorry, I'm not interested.
-I'll take that as naughty. -Naughty.
You know what they say:
"Once you go black, you're going to need a wheelchair."
Hey, Latrell.
-Okay, call me later. -As I was saying....
Look, King Kong. Why don't you take you and your 1980 pickup lines...
climb the Empire State Building, beat on your big old monkey chest...
and then jump off? Excuse me.
Hold up, hold on now. I'll get the--
-This is no joke, man. -Get your hands off me, man.
She don't know it yet, but that's wifey right there.
Hello, everybody. For just one second.
I'm Warren Vandergeld. I'm sure most of you know me.
And I just want to remind you that tonight's the night.
The Vandergeld Foundation's annual charity auction.
So bring your checkbook...
dress to impress, and we'll see you there. Have fun.
-So, what are you going to wear? -This?
You're so funny.
Ladies, you know what this means.
Shopping!
And now, the Number One most requested song on WQQR....
-It's our jam. -This is our jam, ladies. Come on.
Ready? Five, six, seven, eight...
Making my way downtown Walking fast
Faces pass And I'm home bound

Take it, Tiff and Britt. This is your verse.
If I could Just see you
C-minus.
That's hot. Totally hot.

Guys. I can't believe that you just said that.
Said what?
The "N" word.
-So? Nobody's around. -Yeah.
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fo' sho
Ladies, can I help you?
Yes, actually. I need something for my friend.
Something that says, "I'm not a whore but I'm not a virgin either."
I've got just the thing. Come.
-What about you, Brittany? -No, thank you, sweetie. I'm fine.
Good. You can help me. Come on.
-Me? -Yeah, we're girls. That's what we do.
God.
Come on.
-Hello? -Hi, baby.
What's up, baby?
I'm getting my hair done, and I was thinking that we could go to the movies.
How's that sound?
-I'm back. -Who is that?
You're never going to get that big old head in this tiny hole.
-Here, let me help you. -Hold on.
-I'll hold it open while you put it in. -Okay.
-What is she holding? -Push it.
-It's almost in. -What is almost in? Marcus.
Marcus Anthony Copeland II, you better answer me right now.
-It's so tight. -Tight?
The only thing's that's going to be tight is my foot down your throat.
-You better answer me! -It's a perfect fit.
-I can't believe what I just heard. -I told you.
I'm exhausted.
Gina. Damn. Hello? Baby?
What do you think?
That looks so sexy.
Are you kidding?
"Hi, I'm Cellulite Sally. Look at my huge bedonkey."
"And don't forget about me. I'm Back Fat Betty."
Now who could have said that?
Yeah, it's Tina the Talking Tummy.
I can't even wear a short skirt...
and a top without looking like a fat pig.
Calm down. I'll go see if there's something else out there for you. Okay?
Do you think Heath will love.... Do you need help?
I think I need a bigger size.
Honey, you never need a bigger size. Come here.
Let me show you a little trick. Brace yourself.
Suck it in. Squeeze those cheeks, sister.
Suck it in. Come on. Work with me.
Don't give up on me. You can do this. Suck it in.
Now that looks totally cute.
My God! Are you kidding?
"Hi, I'm Carnie Wilson before my gastric bypass surgery."
Well, what about this? This goes with your skin tone.
Somebody throw Shamu back in the ocean!
Okay. Let me get you something else. Okay?
How's that?
I can't breathe.
Honey, this is just not going to work. I'm sorry.
Well, of course not. You're wearing the wrong underwear.
Is that better?
I can taste the leather.
Okay, you need a pair of hot shoes. What size do you wear again?
-Fourteen. -What?
Do you think you could bring us a size 10?
-A what? -A 10.
It's an open-toed slide.
It gives you two sizes in the front and two in the back.
-What about these? This one's-- -You bitch! That's so terrible.
Let me go and see if there's some help out there.
Some professional help. You need professional help. Hang on.
-Okay. -Dr. Phil!
Oprah. Somebody, help me.
Come on out, honey. Let's see.
It is absolutely fabulous. If you don't buy it, I'm buying it for myself.
I don't know. Stand up straight.
Straight?
Turn around.
Honey, just relax. Breathe.
You know what? Maybe a nice dress.
Okay. Who would you do?
Janet Reno or Rosie O'Donnell?
-What! Are you kidding me? -And death is not an option.
I don't know. Rosie.
-You're a pig. That's disgusting. -What are you talking about?
-Rosie's all right. -Heads up. Here they are.
-Hold on. Who would you do? -No time. We're on the job.
-He's got my gun and badge. -Go get him!
Get in! Get in the car.
My God, I need a cigarette!
-Can you believe this? -What do we do?
We follow them. But we can't blow our cover.
-Give me back my bag. -Oh, man.
I'll rip your head off.
Your ass is mine.
What is this girl, a track star?
You messed with the wrong blonde today, pal.
-Holy Christ. -Now I'm pissed.
I think she's bionic, dude.
Holy smokes.
-That was nice. -Jeez, lady. All that for a bag?
It's not just a bag. It's Prada.
-It was like a reality show. -It was so cool.
-Right behind you. -Nice going, Tori.
Way to get us sat at the losers' table. I thought you had it all hooked up.
Excuse me. I do have the hook-up.
Don't blame me. Blame Little Miss Def Jam over here...
who had to go, "Yo' mama" on the Vandergelds.
We could be finished in this town.
Somebody had to stand up to those guys.
They're the "it" girls.
-That's the way it's always been. -Whatever.
Honey, quick. Give me a pat.
No, a powder for my nose. Quick.
Thanks.
No, I'm just kidding.
Hey, Heath.
-Karen, hey. -So...
I tried to call you, but your number changed?
Yeah, I know. I changed it.
Anyway, so, I was just wondering if maybe...
later we could--
Hello. Where have you been all night? I've been looking all over for you.
Why are you talking to her?
Clean it up, coke whore.
Do you have any more of that?
Don't hate me because you ain't me.
Can I have your attention, please?
Gentlemen, get out your wallets...
because you'll be bidding on a date...
with some of Hamptons' most eligible bachelorettes.
First up, yours truly.
Who wants to start the bidding?
-$500? -$500.
Okay. Do I hear $1,000?
Well, looks like we're all on the Vandergelds' D-list.
-Is this seat taken? -Oh, no. Have a seat.
Can you believe this? They're actually auctioning off women.
-Would you ever do anything like that? -Well, it's for a good cause.
Besides, being wined and dined by a rich guy might be nice.
I see, so you like rich guys?
It might be a pleasant change from all the losers that ask me out.
-$3,000. -That's good.
I see.
But I think that we can do better than that.
-$20,000. -Sold.
$20,000. That is a new record.
That is very good.
Next to be auctioned is Tiffany Wilson.
-That's you. -Me?
You better do something.
Excuse me, honey. I'll be right back.
Who wants to start the bidding?
$4.
$4. Do I hear $5?
$1,000.
$1,000. Does anyone wish to go higher?
Yeah, I got $2,000 right here.
$3,000.
$5,000.
Who said that?
$5,000 to the dirty geezer in the back.
I'm sure no one will wish to go higher than that...
so we can just be done with it now.
$10,000.
$20,000.
$20,000! Going once, going twice--
$50,000. Cash!
Fine.
Sold...
to the big black guy right there.
Step right up and claim your prize.
I don't want to go on a date with Buff Daddy.
Come here, baby.
Dude, my feet are killing me.
And on top of that, that G-string gave me diaper rash.
-How long we got to do this, man? -Just a couple more days.
I don't have a couple of more days. Do you know who my wife is?
Here, listen to this message. She's losing her mind.
...with another woman doing what I think you're doing!
You don't want to hear the rest.
By the end of the weekend, we'll be heroes and all will be forgiven.
All right.
-You order room service? -No.
Who is it?
Damn! These girls won't quit.
We'll be right there. We're coming. Hang on.
-Open up! -Open.
One second.
We'll be right there. Hang on.
The ice cream's melting!
Hold tight, girls! We're just shaving our feet, okay?
And braiding our vaginas.
Okay.
What, did you guys forget? It's your turn to host the slumber party.
Okay, you guys. What does it mean...
when a guy is in a really bad relationship...
and it's really obvious that he wants to be with you...
but he just can't seem to break up with his girlfriend?
It means you're a total booty call.
-My God! Brittany! -Well, you were thinking it.
Well, you said it.
You know, sometimes you sound just like a man.
So I've been told.
What she means to say, honey...
is maybe you're just making yourself just a little bit too, like, available.
Come on, you guys.
Don't act like you haven't done it before.
You know how it is when you really care about someone.
You call them all day long...
because you just wanna know how their day is going...
and what they're thinking about and if they're thinking about you.
You spend all day trying to find the perfect outfit.
You even change your hairstyle just so he'll take a second look.
But they never notice.
Sometimes I just wish that they could trade places with us...
so that they would know how it feels. You know?
-All done. -Really?
My God! This is so cool.
You know something?
I think you might have been black in a previous life.
Fo' shizzle, my nizzle.
All right, I got another one for you. Carmen Electra or Pam Anderson?
Easy.
But they both got a yeast infection.
Now that's tough.
-I'm going to go with Pam Anderson. -You're disgusting.
-What? -They got a yeast infection.
Who would you choose?
Hey, Gomez. We got a couple of bogeys.
-No time. -Oh, come on!
It's Pam Anderson, like you care.
Run their faces. Let's go.
-Brittany Wilson? -Yeah, that's me.
Let's get her.
-Put the blindfold on her! -Damn, this girl's strong.
-Who do you work for? -Intimate Fantasies!
My God. You need help?
What are you doing? Those are the strippers, Raoul and Tito.
Strippers?
-I thought they were going to kidnap me. -That's part of their routine.
Oh, my God! I am so sorry.
Hotel security! Is everything all right here?
Everything is fine. Just a little case of PMS. That's all.
I'm just one big, emotional wreck.
Could you guys go get me some Midol and a Snickers?
-Let's get out of here. -My ass is fat.
This is Harper. It's all clear.
Okay, ladies. Let's focus. We have to find the perfect spot.
Skank alert.
My God, girls. I totally forgot my suntan lotion.
I'm gonna get some suntan lotion. I'll be right back.
Hey, Russ.
Hey, bro. Go long. I got a plan. Go.
Hey, yo! You do that again, I'm going to bust....
I'll bust out in tears.
-Inbreds! -You're a jerk.
My bad, sweetheart. Over here. Don't hurt yourself.
Don't worry, I won't.
Sorry. Better lay off the spinach.
Tony. Let's go hunting.
What a beautiful, sunny day.
Oh, my God. What happened to the sun?
Easy, white chocolate.
I wouldn't want you to melt.
Yeah. Hasta la vista, Schwarzenegro. Bye.
Hey, kids! You guys want to make $5?
Yeah! Sure!
Okay, here's what I want you to do.
Yeah, I'll take the usual. And put it on my tab.
Hey, Latrell Spencer! Could we have your autograph?
-Sure, little buddy. -Thanks. You're the greatest.
Hey, that's what I do, baby.
-Sweet! -Nice!
-Hey, stay in school. -Okay, we will!
-Wow! You must be pretty good. -I'm all right.
Sometimes I feel I should be paying them to take my autograph.
I'm sorry, I didn't even get your name.
Latrell. Latrell Spencer. And you are?
-Denise Porter. -Denise. Denise Porter.
You know, you look so familiar. I feel like I've seen you somewhere.
No. I play pro ball. Maybe you've seen one of my games.
No. But I mean if I did, I'm sure I would've definitely remembered you.
Okay, well. Look, Denise...
I don't mean to be too forward or anything...
but I'm here in town, checking out some real estate, and--
Oh, whereabouts?
-You know, up around over there. -In Montauk?
-More like around-- -East Hampton.
Just all over the place. It's one big blur.
One big, business blur.
I kind of want to get away from all that business and...
hang out with somebody and have a real conversation.
So, I was wondering if you're not too busy...
-maybe we can hang out? -Yeah, sure.
-Really? All right. Cool! -Yeah.
So, I'll pick you up at about....
You know, the jet should be here about 7:30...
and the limo will take about a half-hour. About 8:00. Is that good?
-Yeah, 8:00 sounds great. -8:00 sounds good? All right.
-Goodbye. -Take care.
Yes.
Hey, where's our $5?
All right, calm down.
Here you go. $5. $2.50 each.
-You promised to give us $5 each. -Stay in school.
Cheapo.
I am not making excuses. I refuse to believe it.
Really?
I don't want to believe Marcus is cheating.
I don't wanna believe Michael Jackson keeps carving up his nose.
Excuse me. Your card has been declined for insufficient funds.
The rep's on the line.
Yes, this is Mrs. Copeland.
$4,000 dress? And where did I buy this dress?
The Hamptons!
Yes, I remember.
Thank you.
It is on.
I don't see why I got to go out with Mandingo.
'Cause if you don't, you'll blow our cover.
What you gonna be doing?
Me? I'm going to follow up on a lead.
You're going on a date.
She's a reporter.
Who else knows more about the Hamptons people than her?
All right, so I like the girl. You're the one always telling me to settle down.
And you should.
But that don't mean I got to go with Buffy the White Girl Slayer.
All right. Look. Just go to dinner. Okay?
I'm only gonna be a couple of hours and I'll meet you back at the club.
-You promise? -I promise?
I'm serious, dude. Promise.
I do. I'm serious. All right.
And if you need to use protection...
tell Latrell there's an extra shower curtain in the bathroom.
Hop in.
Take your time. Watch those marshmallows.
Ease on in there, now.
I won't bite unless you ask me to.
You are so beautiful.
Good boy, Baby.
How about we listen to a little bit of music?
What the....
How did you know? I love this song!
Making my way downtown Walking fast
Faces pass And I'm home bound
And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall Into the sky
Do you think time Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk A thousand miles
If I could Just see you
Tonight
Good evening, madam.
-Welcome to Bella. -Thank you.
What are you doing here?
I came to borrow the car and the keys to his house.
Are you crazy? If you crash this man's car, he will kill you.
I won't crash it. Look. Just call me before you leave. I'll bring it back.
Then you meet me back at the club.
No, my brother. You got to get your own.
Help me.
Thank you.
May I bring you something from the bar?
Let me have a bottle of your best champagne.
-And bring us some oysters. -Very good, sir.
I have to say, I was so....
I was happy when I bought you at the auction.
I mean, it's very rare I have the opportunity to...
bask in the ambiance of such a classy lady such as yourself.
Oh, my God!
-I am humbled by your... -This athlete's foot is just killing me.
-...beautiful nature. -That smell. That's infection.
-The most high-classness of your.... -My God. Is that a hangnail?
Captivated by your beauty.
Your bountiful curves remind me of the hills in Italy.
I'm sorry. You were saying?
-That's perfect. Thank you. -Are you ready to order?
Yes, I'll have the chicken. White meat only.
And for the lady, perhaps a salad?
Perhaps not. I'll have the steak, smothered in onions.
A rack of ribs. Pasta with extra garlic.
French fries with lots of vinegar and a side of onion rings with lots of sauerkraut.
Have you ever had oysters?
Did you know oysters are an aphrodisiac?
Sorry.
My tongue's kind of big.
It'll open. Hold it!
I'll push. Yeah. See, that did it there.
Just a little turn.
There's so many keys involved...
sometimes it's hard to figure out what's what.
It's Mei Ling.
What are you doing here? Girl, it's late!
Come on, now. You have to go home. Get some rest.
You cannot stay. There are laws against this kind of workmanship.
They'll think I'm running some kind of sweatshop.
That girl does not know when to go home.
I'm telling you, she will stay here and just clean forever.
This is really nice.
Yeah, this is dope.
Dope summer home I picked, boy.
Who's that?
The big, buff, bald dude with the fur?
That's my trainer.
You have your trainer on your wall?
Yes, well, for inspiration. I want to look like that one day and...
I come in every morning and I look at the.... You ever see Titanic?
-No, I haven't seen it. -Me, either.
You want something to drink?
Yeah, sure. A glass of wine would be nice.
Wine.
Okay, so I'll get you a glass of wine and....
That'd be in the kitchen, right?
I don't know. This is your house, Latrell.
Who? Oh, me! Latrell.
That's right. I'm Latrell. That's right. I'm going to get you a bottle of my wine in my house.
I'm going to get you a bottle of my wine in my house.
It's my house and I live here
Damn, little lady!
You sure can put it away.
You're so funny.
Voilà!
You have a dog.
No, I don't have no damn dog.
Well, then whose dog is that?
Shit.
That's not no dog.
That's family.
Hey, cousin.
Come here, boy.
He looks really mad! Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. He just misses me, that's all.
Okay, boy, playtime's over. Let me up!
-You want me to go for help? -No, we're just having fun.
You sure are playful today.
You want to go for a walk, boy?
I'll be right back!
You know what? Forget this! I'm out of here!
I don't want to go on a date with a guy and his dog is biting him and....
What's he doing now? What's that?
Don't pay him no mind.
He's just going to do that until he falls asleep.
Now, where were we? Wine!
You know, I like a woman with a little extra something.
A little cushion for the pushing.
I'd really love for you to come to one of my games.
No, thank you. I've seen you play. Not impressed.
Excuse me? I'm the highest scoring forward in the league!
But all that talent?
Totally overshadowed by nothing but scandals and pure laziness.
Come on! You're shooting under 50 percent from the free throw line, okay?
Your turnover ratio, abysmal.
And on top of that, you can't shoot three-pointers to save your life. So...
squeeze me.
No one's ever cared like that before.
Come here, baby!
Oopsie! I had a poopsie.
Girl, we're going to get along just fine.
Back at you!
-Bask in the ambiance! -I'm going to be sick.
Basking in the ambiance.
So, no. I jump over the fence, fall. I scrape my knee.
-Get out of here. -No, seriously, listen.
I scrape my knee. I get chased by the cops and I spend the night in jail.
That's insane. You did all that just to find J-Lo and Ben's hideaway?
I can't help it. You know, investigative journalism is my passion.
So how'd you end up writing puff pieces for the local news?
Unfortunately, I made some enemies...
and ended up getting fired from my last job.
What happened?
Believe me, you don't want to know about that.
Look, I spent all night talking about myself.
Sometimes it's good for a man to just sit back and listen.
Well, since you put it that way.
I did this piece on Warren Vandergeld.
Him and his partners tried to swindle a guy.
You talking about Ted Burton?
Yeah, how did you know that?
It was in the paper. I read about it.
But what they didn't report in the paper...
was that Burton was 10 times smarter than all of them.
He embezzled millions and stashed it in an offshore account.
When Vandergeld heard the story was going to break...
he didn't want to be embarrassed.
Well, there goes my job.
You know, you're a good listener.
It seems like you have the whole package.
Man!
-Hello? -Kev, you got to go.
-What? Now? -Yeah, now. We're on our way.
Can't you stall him for a little while?
Look, this man sang to me. He tried to kiss me and on top of that...
he been farting for the last 20 minutes.
All right, I'll be there in a minute. Bye.
-Cottontail! -I'm coming, nigga!
Gomez, what the hell are we looking for?
I don't know. Something just isn't right about these girls.
I'm gonna check the bathroom.
Find anything?
No. Not yet.
You won't believe what I.... What the hell are you doing?
Sniffing chicks' underwear, man. What is the big....
It's.... What?
They're guys, aren't they?
You really are disgusting.
Latrell, my man!
-What's going on, brother? -What's up, man?
-Two apple martinis. -You hitting that, bro?
-This is a tough one to crack. -Tiffany Wilson?
She puts the "E" in easy.
Here. Drop a couple of these babies in her drink, man.
Are you sure this will work?
Man, I just took two of them, and I'm telling you...
I'm boinking someone tonight, you know?
Excuse me.
That's for you, my little Miracle Whip.
You need to loosen up. There you go.
That's for you.
-Oh, my God! Is that Britney Spears? -Where?
Right over there. Forget it, she just left.
Oops, she did it again.
-Let's drink up. -Let's do it.
To the last drop.
That's good. You want to dance?
You know, that's a great idea. Here, hold Baby. Let's go, girls.
I found out some interesting information.
Ted Burton turned the tables on Vandergeld.
Tucked away $100 million.
Been living the high life ever since he got out of prison.
There goes our motive.
Those skanks think they're hot?
Let's show them what sexy really is.
They want to battle. Let's go, girls.
You girls want some of this?
Bring it on, sisters!
Okay, let's do it!
Five, six, seven, eight.
Come on.
Hold on.
I know you hookers don't think this is over with.
Let's kick it old school.
They suck!
Oh, my God!
We won!
-Heath! -Come on, let's go.
Get out of my way! Move it!
I need a drink.
Hey, Latrell, my man.
So did it work, man?
I don't know.
But I got to dance.
I got to hit this.
Hold the dog.
Let it out.
Oh, yeah. Now it's out.
I paid thousands of dollars on this outfit...
and do you think he even noticed?
It's going to be okay.
Little Miss Vandergeld walks in... and he just forgets all about me.
Okay, let it out.
I wonder...
if he would think she was so hot...
if he knew that she is broke.
Vandergeld's broke?
We mustn't talk of such things.
No, we won't.
But, yes, they're broke.
My father even had to loan her father money...
just so that they could keep their house.
They just paid us back.
-You guys, I love you guys. -We love you, too.
I love you so much!
Thank you.
Can we get you some gum or a mint or something?
Hey, little girl.
Really? I love you, too.
What the hell are you doing? Give me her!
Sicko. Where's Latrell?
Dance floor.
Good morning, snowflake.
Oh, my God. Brittany!
-What? -We're on page six.
-No. -Yeah.
Look. "Wilson sisters rock Hamptons."
-Wilsons rock! -We rocked!
Wait. We weren't in the Hamptons this weekend.
No! We've been cloned!
He's got to be around here somewhere.
Girl, wait a minute. Isn't that Marcus right there?
-That's him, all right. Old lying dog! -Caught you.
That sounds like Gina.
-Don't answer it. She'll go away. -No, she won't.
I'm not going anywhere until you open this door!
-I told you! What am I going to do? -Just get rid of her.
I'll get rid of her. You hide the stuff.
-I'm not playing with you! -Coming, baby!
What is all that noise?
Nothing! Okay, baby, I'm coming!
I'm coming. Hide.
Hey, baby! Hi, boo-boo.
-Nice room you got, Marcus. -Hey, baby, what you doing here?
-I could ask you the same question. -Me?
I'm on assignment.
Are you wearing lipstick?
No. That's Kool-Aid. You want some?
You know, it's filled with lots of vitamin C and riboflavin.
Is that a bra?
No, this?
This is the new holsters they gave us at work.
They're government issue. You can put two guns in there and just....
"Freeze, FBI!"
-I know somebody's in here. -Baby, nobody's in here.
See? Nobody's in here.
Check under the bed--
What do you mean, "Check under the bed"?
-I heard somebody on the phone. -Check under the bed!
-That's where everybody hides! Check it! -Marcus! Nobody can fit!
See, nobody here, right? Nobody there.
-I'll look in the bathroom. -Wait! No! Don't check the bathroom!
You don't want me to check the bathroom!
See? Nothing in the bathroom. Nobody in the room. See?
I told you no one was here. See?
You know, baby, this gotta stop!
-We can't have love if we don't have trust. -I know, but look.
I was at the restaurant and the card wouldn't go through--
Listen. If we don't have trust, we don't have nothing.
-This is not about trust. This is about-- -Gina!
There she is, right there!
Now, baby. I can explain.
-I knew it. -Baby, it's not what you think.
-Baby, it's not what you think. -Don't you even say nothing to me!
I can explain. Baby, it's not what you think.
He's a man!
You're sick!
We have to find them and stop them before they execute their evil plan.
-Wait, what do they look like? -Duh, us!
Afternoon, ladies.
The Chief would like to have a word with you.
My God, Tiffany. They're the Men in Black.
Come on.
-Easy, Ponch and Jon. My hair! -Let's move it along, pal.
-Wait a minute! -Let's go!
Chief, we just got confirmation that Burton's arrived at JFK.
I want him trailed. Give him plenty of room.
I don't want anyone jumping the gun. I want to get this guy red-handed.
-Get your hands off of me! -Let's go.
-Hey, easy! -Right this way, girls.
What the hell you guys doing with the Wilson sisters?
-Chief, these aren't the Wilson sisters. -No, sir.
Chief, check this out.
My God! What are you doing?
-That's on there pretty good. -Let her go.
That's nothing, Chief.
How about....
-Those are nice. -That's enough!
I don't know how he did that...
but you can't fake these.
My God! Look who's here. It's that beautiful--
Save it!
Because of you, I had to suspend two of my best agents!
-Chief, I can explain. -I don't want to hear it!
You're just lucky we caught Burton before he could strike.
But Burton is not our guy!
Let me guess: Women's intuition?
You're both fired.
Turn in your guns and your badges. This operation is over!
-Come on, Chief! You can't fire us. -I just did.
Forget him, Marcus. We can do this ourself.
-Look, all we got to do is-- -Wait.
"We"? Kevin, this ain't about "we."
It's never been. It's about you.
You come up with some stupid idea and I'm dumb enough to go along with it.
And look where it's gotten me, Kevin.
I just lost my wife and my job because of you.
So don't tell me about "we" no more, all right?
They bought it. The FBI is packing up.
They'll be out of our hair in a couple hours.
We could make the grab tonight.
You sure you and your friend can get the job done?
Would I let you down, Mr. V?
-Hey, man. I just want to say sorry. -Forget about it, dude.
No. You're right. You're absolutely right. I've been selfish.
I'm always dragging you into everything. I never even asked what you want to do.
I don't know, there's something about always having you around, that just...
makes me want to step up my game.
I guess it's because I always know you're gonna have my back.
Hello?
Thanks.
-Who was that? -That was Josh.
Turns out that Vandergeld's prints was all over the ransom note.
-What are you doing? -Calling the Chief.
No, you ain't! You said we could do this on our own, right?
What about backup?
I got you, you got me. That's all the backup we need.
Triple T-K-A.
Time to totally kick ass!
Three generations at the Bureau and I'm the first to get fired.
My dad is going to kill me!
Yeah? What? Who?
-Copeland! -Copeland, you dick!
You've got a lot of nerve, calling.
Where?
-You better not be wrong about this. -What?
-We might be getting our jobs back. -What are you talking about?
-We gotta go. -What do you mean, go?
How about this? RuPaul or Whoopi Goldberg?
-I told you, I'm not playing your games. -Come on!
-Any sign of Vandergeld? -I don't see him.
All right, keep an eye out for him.
If it's going down, it's going to go down here.
Thank God! There you are! I did it.
-You did what? -I got you into the fashion show!
Brittany, did you hear that? We're in the fashion show.
Not if we don't get moving. Come on, let's go!
-Get the lead out, ladies. -I mean, it's like you forgot.
-You mean the Wilson sisters are in? -And we're out?
I'm sorry. That's just the way it is. They're hot, you're not! So deal with it.
-You! Straighten up that blouse, now! -That's impossible!
We've been on that catwalk every summer for six years straight!
Let's just cut to the chase.
Who do we have to sleep with for us to get in the show?
Honey, you're so barking up the wrong tree right now. Really!
If you nail this, you're a shoo-in for the cover of Hamptons.
Darlings! Where have you been?
Megan! Don't!
This is unacceptable.
They just messed with the wrong girls!
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Can we get the Wilson sisters their outfits now, please? Go.
-Can we talk? -Of course.
You were incredible at the nightclub last night.
-Thank you. Thanks. -Incredible.
And Heather will be leaving after the party tonight, and I was thinking...
And Heather will be leaving after the party tonight, and I was thinking... maybe you could come by around 2:00?
Make that 3:00 a.m.
You know what?
I don't think so.
Excuse me?
You think I'm just a booty call.
Well, I'm not.
I deserve better than that.
I'm tired of being your doormat.
Doormat.
Honey...
what makes you think you're that special?
-Bastard. -Excuse me.
Asswipe!
-You're going to regret that. -I'm so scared.
Oh, my God! Tiffany!
-Thank you so much, honey. -I am so proud of you.
Thanks. I just wish I didn't feel so crappy.
Honey.
Sometimes a man can't see when he has someone so special...
sitting right in front of him.
Are you, like, a lesbian?
-I better go get changed. -Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen, this evening we are proud to present...
the fall couture line, Aubrey Allure. Please take your seats.
-Excuse me? -You're not on the list.
Invitation, my ass! They don't know how we do it.
-Let's just blend. -All right.
Go! Get going! Move it!
Didn't we just have this conversation?
Can we get these fantastic supermodels... -back into their dressing rooms? -I can't believe it!
-back into their dressing rooms? -I can't believe it!
-They changed that quick! -Amazing!
These ought to get the critics' attention.
Second changes, everybody! Go! Now!
This'll be a nice little treat.
My God! What's happening?
That's not mine!
Let's get out of here!
I'm sorry!
Just give me your hand. It'll be okay.
I'm so sorry. Oh!
Come here! I got you!
Here we go. Up!
-My God! -I hope she's okay.
I'm ruined.
Looks like some people just don't know when to quit. Come on, girls.
-Help me. -I got you.
Karen, what are you doing?
Look, someone has got to give those girls a taste of their own medicine.
So revolutionary! It's so bold and so....
So brilliant!
Everybody, they're imposters!
Hit the lights.
-Marcus? -Brittany?
Where's Brittany?
Brittany? Where are you?
-Brittany! -Tiffany!
Get down!
I told you you were going to regret it.
You hit like a bitch! Come on.
You run and I'll shoot you. Come on.
-My turn. -Mama?
Girl, we going to need some backup.
Keisha? Hey. Girl, call NayNay and LaQuanda.
Tell them to bring the Vaseline and the straight razors.
These bitches are on some other shit!
What's going on?
-Don't touch my dress! -Vandergeld's got Tiffany!
What? No one messes with my queen!
Marcus! Are you okay?
-No. -What's wrong?
These damn G-strings are killing me!
-Freeze! -FBI.
You guys take care of them. We're going after Vandergeld.
Copeland! You're going to need this.
Come on, let's go.
FBI! Freeze!
Daddy, what are you doing?
Why don't you take your mother and your sister and go on home?
Daddy, why are you doing this?
Daddy didn't tell you? He's broke.
What do you mean, broke?
Like Martha Stewart broke or MC Hammer broke?
-MC Hammer broke! -No!
I've been funneling money out of the charity...
into a private account, just to get us by!
Are you filming this?
I'll give you something to shoot!
-Get out of my way! -I can't do that.
No!
Drop it!
I got you, man. Man, we'll get that stain out. Don't even worry.
Don't move!
Warren Vandergeld, you are under arrest!
I just want to tell you, I appreciate what you did. That was real brave of you.
I had no choice. I couldn't let them take my one true love away.
Hey, dude. I ain't what you think I am.
Baby, we all got secrets. That's okay.
Are you telling me that you are not....
-Yeah. I'm not a woman. -White?
The deception! The betrayal, man! You deceived me!
Calm down. I'm an FBI agent. I was uncovering a--
Negro, please!
Didn't somebody tell you this was an all-white party?
Someone get this jigaboo away from me!
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
So, do I get to see my knight in shining armor?
-Well.... -Get a leg!
Get off me!
What do you mean? I'm going to let you have it!
-You ain't never met nobody like me! -It's me!
You don't know who you messing with! My name's Gina!
You don't know who you messing with! My name's Gina! It's me.
-Kevin? -Latrell?
-Gina. -Marcus?
This is some Jerry Springer shit!
Once again, you guys managed to do everything I told you not to do.
You caused over $250,000 worth of damage.
Two people were shot.
But at least you got the right guy.
-Good work. -Thanks a lot, Chief.
But we couldn't have done it without Gomez and Harper.
All right, I'll see you all in the office tomorrow.
Good work, guys.
Who will be featured on the cover of Hamptons Magazine?
I have to take care of some business.
See you guys on Monday.
So, who do you think wore those panties you were sniffing?
Kevin or Marcus?
-Gomez, I told you. I was looking for DNA. -Oh, yeah.
What are you laughing at, "Denzel"?
"Oh, what a beautiful chocolate man!"
You guys got some work to do?
I'm Denise Porter. Good night.
I'm Kevin Copeland. I'm an FBI agent.
I make $30,000 a year after taxes.
I don't drive a Bentley and I don't have a house on a hill.
But I'd really like to take you out.
Are you kidding me? Any man...
who would jump in front of a bullet for me...
can definitely take me on a date.
-Come on, girl, let's go. -Wait, could I just please--
-I have nothing more to say to you. -I know. Just listen to me, please.
Gina, I lied to you.
I've hid things from you.
But I have never cheated on you. But I am guilty.
I'm guilty of paying more attention to my job than I do my wife.
I'm guilty of not appreciating all the little things you do for me.
Like getting your hair done.
Wearing that sweet-smelling Chanel cologne I love so much.
But my biggest crime is that I didn't tell you I loved you every single day.
-You're not going to let him off that easy. -Will you shut up?
I love you.
A wheelchair?
Yes, but the feeling will come back, I promise.
Making my way downtown Walking fast
Faces pass And I'm home bound
Backup, Tony.
Hey, girls.
So you guys were pretending to be them the entire time?
Yes, we were. But we was only doing our job.
I hope you guys aren't too pissed off at us.
We're so bummed!
We liked Brittany and Tiffany...
so much more when you were them.
So much more!
So I guess this means we won't be hanging out any more?
Don't say that. Of course, we will hang out.
This test does not measure a student's aptitude,

It measures a student's innate ability,

Those who score well are recruited into a secret paramilitary academy.
Some call them seductresses. Some call them spies.
Fools call them innocent. They call themselves D.E.B.S.
Good morning, D.E.B.S. Attention, D.E.B.S.!
Attention! Emergency alert! That means report right now!
Right this second! You have no time to sleep, ladies!
Go, go, go!
-And I mean now, ladies! -Dominique.
The world might be destroyed while you nap!
Come on Dominique. Phipps is freaking out.
-I need you guys up! -Five minutes.
And no boys allowed upstairs.
Out.
-What? -Let's go! I want everybody up!
-Janet. Five minutes. -Have you seen my gun?
Move it, move it! Everybody in the house!
What did I do with it?
D.E.B.S. Max here.
Amy, it's for you.
Hello. No. No! I'm not--
I'm not talking about this anymore.
Get out.
And take your clothes with you. I don't do laundry.
Let's go! Let's go, let's go!
Move it, move it, move it! I don't have all day, D.E.B.S.
I do not have all day!
Ten!
-Bobby, seriously, it's not a good time. -Nine.
-Eight. -When? When is a good time?
-Stop calling. -Amy!
-Five. Four. -I'm coming.
-Three. -After all we've been through?
-Two, one. -Goodbye, Bobby.
I broke up with Bobby.
-What? -I broke up with Bobby.
-Oh, my God! Why? -He was just so boring.
He's an ass. What?
I like him. I think he's sweet.
-I'm just not in love. -What?
I said, I want to be in love!
Why are you yelling?
-Hi, Amy. -Hi.
-Hey, Mr. P. -Don't call me that.
-Hey, Mr. P. -What's up, Mr. P?
Bonjour, Mr. P.
Hey, can I get a farmer's daughter short stack and bacon, well done.
Tofu scramble, peach smoothie, non-dairy.
-Cheeseburger, extra pickles. -Coffee, black.
We have a special guest with us this morning.
-Ms. Petrie. -Ms. Petrie?
She never comes down here!
Ladies.
I just want to say what a pleasure it is to finally meet y--
No time for pleasantries.
Phipps, a matter of some urgency has come to my attention.
Lucy Diamond is back in the States.
-Oh, my God. -Oh, she is all--
You're kidding. I'm writing my thesis on her.
I expect to be kept in the loop on this one.
Let's show some hustle.
-I can't believe she's back. -Who's Lucy Diamond?
Lucy Diamond.
She's the last surviving member of the Reynolds crime syndicate.
Her family did battle with the Schaffers,
in a vicious blood feud that lasted a decade.
After her father's death, she inherited the keys to his kingdom.
Illegal arms-running, smuggling, gambling,
and her specialty, diamond theft.
She's protected by a loyal band of mercenaries, led by this man,
She's protected by a loyal band of mercenaries, led by this man, Scud.
It is believed Lucy Diamond was behind the plot to sink Australia in '99.
Three attempts have been made to apprehend her. All failed.
In 2003 she went underground,
In 2003 she went underground, and has not been seen or heard from since.
-Yikes. -That's not even the bad part.
What's the bad part?
No one has ever fought her, and lived to tell about it.
Peach smoothie, farmer's daughter, tofu scramble and cheeseburger.
Coffee.
So why do you think she's back in town?
Our intel suggests she's in town to meet this woman. Ninotchka Kaprova.
Ex-KGB, now freelance assassin.
They're scheduled to meet tonight, 2000 hours.
Find out what Lucy is up to. Strictly surveillance.
Do not try to apprehend her yourselves. Max, you're in charge.
Amy, you're second. And, D.E.B.S., be careful.
What does a reclusive criminal mastermind want
with a Russian trained killer?
Your scheduled meet, 2000 hours.
-Where'd you find her? -Zeda tipped us.
Said she's available. She's in from Prague. Relocating state-side.
-Assassin? -Check.
-Where's the meet? -Les Deux Amour.
Trendy, yet discreet.
Cancel it.
Why? It's all set up.
-I don't do blind dates. -Well, it's not a blind date...
-I don't do blind dates. -Well, it's not a blind date... -...if you know what they look like. Okay? -Just tell her I'm not coming.
-...if you know what they look like. Okay? -Just tell her I'm not coming. -Say I came down with something. -Come on Lucy, it's been two years.
-Say I came down with something. -Come on Lucy, it's been two years.
-You have to get out there. -I am out there.
I went out with that drummer, the girl from the band that talked loud.
No, you didn't go out with her. We all went out together.
And then you lied and said you had food poisoning, and you went home early.
Yeah, well, she talked really loud, even when you were right next to her.
Look, I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to drown yourself
Look, I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to drown yourself in your little schemes to destroy the world but you need to get over it already.
in your little schemes to destroy the world but you need to get over it already.
-You were dumped. -I was not dumped.
Oh, you were dumped hard. And that sucks.
You took time off to go to Antarctica or whatever.
You took time off to go to Antarctica or whatever. Reykjavik. It's in Iceland.
But now it's time to get back in the game, Lucy.
You've got a date tonight with a beautiful Russian assassin,
and you're gonna show up.
-Lucy. -Fine.
Okay, I'll go. I'll be there.
Just promise me you'll be open.
-Open to what? -Open to love.
Hey, look. Look. Check this out.
Ms. Petrie is handpicking girls for the International Bureau.
I'm gonna see if I can get an interview.
Do you think Mr. Phipps would let me take some time off after endgame?
What are you talking about?
I don't know. There's this art school in Barcelona.
Art school?
Amy, you're the perfect score. You could have your choice
of any assignment you want after endgame.
-Who's your best friend? -You are my best friend.
And what did I say to you the very first day of academy?
"That's my bunk, bitch."
-Okay, after I said that. -"D.E.B.S. stick together."
Exactly.
We've been through four years of hell and now we're top squad, right?
We're just getting to the good stuff.
So you're not gonna ruin it all by going to art school.
-Am I right? -Yes. You are always right.
You need to put it here. Don't be an idiot for once.
You need to speak English or French.
"Fringlish" is not a language.
-D.E.B.S. Janet speaking. Over. -Janet, put her on.
-It's Bobby. -I don't wanna talk to him.
-She doesn't want to talk to you. Over. -Bullshit! I need to talk to her.
Copy that. He really needs to see you.
He should not call her. It is embarrassing.
Bobby, I told you, it's over.
-Over. No. -But we've gotta talk.
I'm serious. No.
Amy, we need to talk.
Jesus, Bobby, what are you doing here?
You think you guys are the only ones onto Lucy Diamond? Everyone's here.
You think you guys are the only ones onto Lucy Diamond? Everyone's here. The feds, the CIA.
-Can't believe it. -This is our stakeout.
Always sticking their heads in our business. It's unbelievable.
Could you guys excuse us for a minute?
Why do you have to be such a jerk about everything?
Well, when my girlfriend breaks up with me for no reason,
after eight months, you'll excuse me I'm a little hostile. -It's not for no reason. -Well then give me one.
-It's not for no reason. -Well then give me one. I just want more.
-More what? -I don't know.
-What are they saying? -I'm not gonna spy on them.
You are a spy, dipshit.
-Is there somebody else? -No. There's nobody--
Because if there's somebody else, I swear to God--
-I just-- -Speak.
I'm not in love with you.
Well.
I guess nobody's good enough for Little Miss Perfect Score.
Shut up!
Oh, yeah, you'll be back.
You can do this.
Why is it I can hold the whole world hostage,
I'm scared of going on one stupid blind date?
Because love is harder than crime.
Okay, now, knock them dead.
But not really.
Sure.
-Are you okay? -Hey, she's arrived.
Okay, we've got visual.
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I got lost.
It is no problem. I was early.
-I have that sweater. -What?
I have the sweater she's wearing, but in taupe.
Really? Where did you get it?
-Target. -No way.
Silence!
I'll have the Cobb.
And some wine.
-Do you want wine? -Vodka.
Vodka. Please.
Lucy Diamond, she's...
-What? -Real.
-I never thought I'd see her in person. -Yeah.
They also have it in teal.
So you're an assassin?
How's that work?
It's mostly freelance.
So you basically, what, you kill, like, whoever?
Sometimes maim.
-Maiming's more. -What are they saying?
They are talking about killing and how to kill and who to kill.
-Oh, God. -But I do it just to pay bills.
-Really? -Mostly...
...I want to be dancer.
-Yeah. Can I have my bracelet back? -What are you doing?
My dad got that bracelet when he graduated from Quantico.
Greatest dance instructor in Russia, but I can't afford to pay, so he say,
"My wife is cheating on me. You kill her lover, I give you free lessons."
Fine, okay. Oh, my gosh.
First man was goat farmer, so I use goat shears.
Second man, he likes chickens, so I took six chickens and put in thro--
-What's wrong? -Oh, you know, I just--
I'm feeling really ill. It's my stomach. I--
I'm feeling really ill. It's my stomach. I-- -I think I have food poisoning. -Are you blowing me?
-I think I have food poisoning. -Are you blowing me?
-What? -Off.
-Are you blowing me off? -No, no, no.
Let's do this.
-Was it something I said? -No. No. Look, I just--
I just got back into town, you know? And-- And--
-And I just got out of this relationship-- -I'm not asking for relationship!
It's not you. You seem really nice, you do. It's me.
Baby, I can change.
Guys...
I'm just not interested.
Then only you will die alone.
Amy, Janet, head Lucy off by the kitchen. Me and Dom are gonna take the back.
Mr. Phipps specifically ordered us not to engage her.
Janet...
-Who here isn't gonna graduate? -Me.
-Why? -I haven't earned my stripes.
Oh, would that be this thing here?
And why is that?
You need to give me a recommendation. I don't see why you just won't--
Not what I asked.
I need to show courage in the face of unspeakable danger.
Exactly.
So quit your whining and follow my orders.
Let's go!
Okay. I'll check the parking lot. You go that way.
-Stay in communication range. -But Mr.--
You can do this, Janet.
Janet, are you there?
-Oh, shit! -Oh, my God.
-I am so sorry. -I'm so sorry.
-Oh, my God. -Oh, shit.
-You're Lucy Diamond. -You're a D.E.B.
You have the right to remain silent.
-You're reading me my rights? -Anything you say can...
-You're reading me my rights? -Anything you say can... ...and will be used against you.
-Okay, here's the thing. -Yeah?
-I am really not up for dying today. -Me neither.
So I was thinking that...
-Why don't you put your gun down. -Put your gun down.
You're the criminal, and I'm the cop, so I think I'm more trustworthy.
I was totally minding my own business on a stupid blind date,
when you guys decided to rain shit all over me.
Wait.
-You were on a blind date? -Whatever.
-With that Russian girl? -What?
Nothing. I just... I didn't know you were a--
Why would you know?
-That really torpedoes my thesis. -Your thesis?
I'm writing a term paper on you.
-You're kidding me. -No, it's for Capes and Capers.
Gender Reconstruction and the Criminal Mastermind.
-It's a really popular class. -Oh, come on.
But it's hard because there's only anecdotal evidence about you.
I mean, nobody's actually ever spoken to you.
Until now.
Right. Until now.
I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.
Amy. Bradshaw, D.E.B.S. Sector 1.
Lucy Diamond.
It's really nice to meet you.
You're still, you know, under arrest.
-Am I? -Amy!
Or you could just let me go.
-I really couldn't. -Come on.
-I really couldn't. -Come on. Haven't you ever done anything you're not supposed to?
-Amy, where are you? -I'm over here.
Son of a bitch!
Are you okay? We couldn't reach you.
-I'm fine. -Well, what happened?
She was here.
-Lucy Diamond was here. -That's impossible.
If she was here, you'd be dead right now.
You guys...
Sweet Jesus.
Do you know what this means?
You are the only one ever to fight Lucy Diamond,
and live to tell about it.
What a disaster!
I am so sorry. Leave it to the D.E.B.S.
You're in town a week, and they're all over you, just grabbing--
What?
-Really, what? -I met somebody.
I knew it. Okay. I mean, it was a little weird
the thing about the dance, but I had a feeling you and Ninotchka--
No, no, no. Scud, Ninotchka was a train wreck thing.
I'm not following you.
Okay, first of all swear to me you're not gonna freak out about this.
-Freak out about what? -You know, sometimes--
-Freak out about what? -You know, sometimes-- Oh, my God! Who is it?
Okay, what do you know about an Amy Bradshaw?
Amy Bradshaw. The girl from the smuggling op.
-No. -No.
Oh, my God.
Amy Bradshaw?
Blond hair.
Plaid skirt.
She's a D.E.B. Okay, not only is she a D.E.B.
She's a D.E.B. Okay, not only is she a D.E.B. she is the D.E.B. She is the perfect score.
she is the D.E.B. She is the perfect score. What is that supposed to mean?
Amy Bradshaw is the only person ever
to get a perfect score on the secret test in the SAT.
-Give me the keys Scud. -Are you listening to me?
Perfect score means perfect spy.
She is their pride and joy, she is literally their poster child.
Well, their poster child doesn't know it yet, but she's into me.
You can't be serious. Would you say back on the horse?
Where are you going?
Back.
P.S. She's straight!
You stay here.
Lucy, I beg of you--
All right, D.E.B.S. Show me what you're made of.
-Amy. -Oh, my God!
Jesus!
Okay, just hold on.
-What are you doing here? -I wanted to see you.
Why?
Well, I was thinking about what you said about your paper.
My thesis?
I think it's stupid for you to do outdated research,
when you could come straight to the source.
You?
Come out with me. I'll let you ask me anything.
-I can't go out with you. -Why not?
Like, a zillion reasons.
Well, you have to come out with me.
Janet, what are you doing here?
I don't know who that is, but he ruined my sweater!
-I don't know who you think you are. -Janet, no!
Did you go to Dalton?
Yeah.
-Where are you taking us? -Where do you want to go?
Home!
What are you doing?
Come on.
Look, these tunnels go on for miles,
so you guys could be lost in there for days, even weeks.
Okay. Suit yourself.
I have to pee.
-Want a beer? -No.
Come on.
Sit down.
So how long you been a D.E.B.?
You're gonna have to talk to me sooner or later.
Look, I don't know what you expect to accomplish by bringing me here.
Lighten up. I know there are a load of questions you're just dying to ask me.
Come on, tell me about your thesis.
-It's stupid. -Well, try me.
I guess my central hypothesis, is that as a woman operating in a male-dominated field,
is that as a woman operating in a male-dominated field,
you felt the need to overcompensate,
by being exponentially more ruthless and diabolical,
than your established male counterparts.
I am not more ruthless.
I think an argument could be made that you are, i.e. we're here.
That's interesting.
Continue.
And I think that these psychological forces combine
to create a kind of emotional void
in which you're incapable of loving or being loved.
-See, that is so not true. -What?
-I'm open to love. I am! -I'm sorry. It's just a theory.
Well, what the hell do you know about it anyway?
Nothing.
I just broke up with my boyfriend, like, five hours ago.
I'm sorry, that sucks.
Thanks.
Why did you break up with him?
I don't know, it just, it wasn't...
I think love should be irresistible, like a drug, you know.
I think love should be irresistible, like a drug, you know. I think when it happens you should just not be able to help yourself.
I just...I wanted...
more. Yeah.
-Babbling. -No.
You're not at all.
This is so weird. I...
-Why aren't you killing me? -Not into that.
But you killed those agents in Antarctica.
They died of frostbite or something. I never even met them.
-And those ATF guys in Peru? -Ebola.
You're so not what I expected.
Well, I think that's a good thing.
So, what's up with Ninotchka? -Oh, God, she was such a headcase. -Where do you meet someone like that?
-Oh, God, she was such a headcase. -Where do you meet someone like that?
Yes!
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but your friend appears to be hitting on my friend.
-You're not wrong. -Yeah, but my friend's not into that.
So Bobby's just, like, all over me, and I just...
I just feel like he doesn't get me, you know?
Do you ever feel like nobody understands you?
Yes, all the time.
I am really glad I met you.
I'm really glad I met you too.
I should go.
Okay.
Am I gonna see you again?
Do you wanna see me again?
I mean, I'm breaking, like, eight federal statutes,
-...being here with you right now. -Yes, I know.
I could get kicked out of the D.E.B.S. for this.
For what?
Oh, my God! She almost kissed you.
You almost let her!
You owe me 50 bucks.
-Amy. -Take me home.
-It's okay. -Take me home.
-Amy. -What?
-Amy. -What? -Well, when can I see you again? -You can't.
-Come on. -I'm serious. We cannot do this again.
Amy.
I have to go.
I'm gonna come find you.
-What just happened? -Nothing happened.
She was totally going to kiss you. You're so into her.
She was totally going to kiss you. You're so into her. I am not!
You violated a prime directive. Plus, hello, it's a girl.
-You're so busted. -No, I'm not.
You violated the section codes as much as me.
D.E.B.S. Code Section 1, Article 2
"D.E.B.S. will not consort with a known enemy, under penalty of treason."
"D.E.B.S. will not consort with a known enemy, under penalty of treason." I was not consorting.
-You exchanged e-mails with Scud. -That's not the same.
You got drunk and nearly got the chancellor of Bulgaria killed.
-That wasn't my fault. -Remember how I covered for you?
I never told anybody. If Max found about that,
I never told anybody. If Max found about that, you would never ever get your stripes and never graduate.
-I can't believe you. -Not a word. Nothing happened.
Where have you been?
I couldn't sleep, so I took a walk.
I was really upset,
about Bobby.
Yeah, Bobby.
Oh, yeah. I forgot, I'm sorry.
-Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine.
Good.
You know, I can't stop thinking about Lucy Diamond.
-You too? -Yeah, I feel like she's playing...
...some type of sick game of cat and mouse with us.
I don't know.
Hey, but you guys be careful, okay?
Good night.
Yeah. Be careful.
Oh, my God, is it true? Did you fight Lucy Diamond?
I heard you cut off her hand. Does she have her hand?
Yes, she still has both of her hands. God.
-Everybody's talking about it. -About what?
How you met Lucy Diamond and lived to tell about it.
They're calling you a hero, when, really, you're a slut.
-You shut up. -A gay slut.
-I'm not gay! -Ms. Petrie wants to see you.
What? Janet!
-What's going on? -Madam Petrie.
-She's coming down. -Here? Why?
She never comes here.
-Ms. Petrie, I would just like to say-- -Who are you?
-Max Brewer. -Well, Max Brewer, my time is precious.
-You're wasting it. Where's the girl? -Bradshaw comma Amy?
You.
Excellent. Well, take one over here.
Right there.
Excellent. Sit.
Chill.
First...
-Amy. -Amy.
Let me just say how delighted I am to meet you.
When I heard that one of our own girls,
had actually engaged Lucy Diamond and lived to tell the tale.
I mean, Fred, over at Central Intelligence nearly peed his pants, he was so jealous.
This stunt is really going to put the academy on the map.
Lisa from Interpol called to extend her congratulations.
I'll bet.
This is just too much fun!
Now, Alice--
-Amy. -Amy.
We are going to need a description of the encounter.
-The encounter? -Everything that happened...
-The encounter? -Everything that happened... ...no matter how small or seemingly irrelevant.
-Why? -To develop a profile, of course.
Nobody's ever been this close to Lucy Diamond before.
You, for all intents and purposes, are our leading expert.
I don't think I'm an expert at all.
You underestimate yourself.
I took the liberty of accessing your private files.
-What? -"It's a Man's World:
Lucy Diamond and the Psychology of Cultural Criminality."
-Oh, God. -"Lucy Diamond...
...is at once a narcissistic sociopath and a victimized girl-child,
eternally searching for the love of her father.
Her crimes could be viewed as a desperate cry for help.
The more she steals, the deeper her feeling of emptiness."
-Annie-- -Amy.
I think you identify with Lucy Diamond.
I think she sees your pathos.
You've got some dangerous union symbiosis going on.
What's that movie with Jodie and the dog falls in the well with the lotion?
What's that movie with Jodie and the dog falls in the well with the lotion? -Silence of the Lambs. -You're the lamb, Amy.
We can use that to our advantage.
I'm putting you in charge of this investigation.
What?
You are hereby promoted to squad captain.
No.
Is there a problem?
Excuse me, ma'am, but I am the captain of this squad.
-Miss...? -Brewer.
Brewer. There is a killer on the loose. There is no time for egos.
This is not the Girl Scouts, this is espionage!
We have a chance to do something here.
You have a chance to do something.
Don't let us down.
Ready your troops.
You head out at 1400.
That's all.
Max!
-Max. Max. -What?
I didn't mean for this to happen, I swear to God. I don't even wanna be captain.
That's just it. You don't even want it.
Boys fall at your feet, the school kisses your ass,
and Mrs. Petrie makes you squad captain.
You'd be just as happy drawing in your stupid little book.
I don't understand why you have to take away the only thing I have going for me.
-Oh, Max-- -Just--
Whatever.
It's fine.
-Just promise me one thing. -What?
You catch the bitch.
Lucy Diamond's on the move! Robbery in progress! Code 99!
The bank employees are being held hostage.
Lucy and her cohorts are still inside.
Apprehend the suspect, recover the money.
The bank is coming up on your left.
The bank is coming up on your left. D.E.B.S., be careful.
D.E.B.S. spotted en route. ETA two minutes.
Copy that.
D.E.B.S. en route, two minutes.
Do I look okay?
This is retarded.
-Bradshaw? -What?
The plan?
Oh, okay. Formation Alpha Kappa Gamma.
Let's do this!
What was that?
She's here.
She's watching us.
Jesus.
Come here.
I can't.
-Come here. -I can't.
What are you doing?
Nothing. Let's go.
We'll be right back.
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.
-What? -It's a trap.
-Whatever. -Look, wait!
Why are you giving me such a hard time?
Fantastica. This is great.
If you're gonna do the job, do the job right.
Creepy shadows, no bad guys, enclosed space. Trap.
-You think I can't handle it? -No.
I know that you can't handle it.
You know what, I don't care if you are the perfect score.
Perfect whore.
You wouldn't know Alpha Gamma if it was tattooed on your forehead.
-Guys. -This is stupid. We are going to die.
No, it's okay.
As your senior officer,
I order you to secure the vault, soldier.
-You order me? -You heard me.
Fine.
See, that wasn't so hard.
I think you guys owe me an ap--
Trap.
-What are you doing here? -I wanted to apologize for last night.
I was-- I was out of line.
-You have to release them. -Who?
The hostages. And put back the money.
This thing has gotten way out of hand.
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!
Please don't smoke.
Please?
Oh, my God, tell her not to smoke.
There's not enough oxygen. We're gonna run out of air,
and we're all gonna be faint on the floor
and the air that's gonna be left is gonna be toxic.
This is bullshit.
This cannot get any worse.
Trap.
Don't you understand? I can't be here.
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stress you out.
I'm not stressed out!
-No. No! -This is not possible.
I'm such a freak. -You must think I'm a freak. -No, I don't.
-You must think I'm a freak. -No, I don't. -I don't. -I'm sorry I wigged out last night.
-It's okay. -It's just...
...I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
-Yeah, okay. -I mean...
-I mean, I really like you. -Right.
But I don't, like, like you.
Yeah. Yeah, I gathered.
That's why I brought you here, so we could clear the air between us.
I mean It's really sweet of you to go to all this trouble, the chute and all. But my friends are gonna wonder where I am.
the chute and all. But my friends are gonna wonder where I am.
-No, they're not. -Why?
No reason.
Lucy!
-Going to be squashed! -Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, my God. Lucy!
Come on. It's not like they're gonna die or anything.
No! No! Oh, no!
Let them out. I'm serious.
Okay. Jesus. Booby trap deactivated. Happy?
That wasn't funny.
It was kind of funny.
I can't.
-I gotta go. -No, no, I'll go.
Look, I understand this whole thing isn't gonna work out between us,
because, obviously, I misinterpreted the whole situation. But...
I just want you to know that last night was the most alive I've felt in a while.
So I guess I'll see you around. Same Bat-time or whatever.
Come with me.
Come on. What do you have to lose?
Everything.
Oh, my gosh. Lucy Diamond has Amy.
You guys, she's been kidnapped.
A D.E.B. is down.
We will spare no expense.
We will leave no rock unturned.
We will not rest until we see that she comes back safely.
No, no!
Amy, where are you?
I know you're out playing hooky with Lucy,
but they have the whole school looking for you. Bobby, everybody.
Call me.
You know where she is? Do you know where she is?
How about this? Do you wanna answer me?
Amy, oh, my God, if you don't come back, I'm telling.
I am telling your mother. I'm calling her and telling her right now.
Seriously, Amy, I'm sorry I left such a mean message. Just...
Please, come home.
So then this mysterious man shows up at my high school,
and hands me this letter which is, like:
"Congratulations, you've just been accepted into Jameson University."
And I'm like, "I didn't apply to Jameson University."
The government's freaky that way.
Yeah.
So, what does it measure, this secret test in the SAT?
I don't know.
-You never asked? -No. It measures spy stuff.
-What? -It's just weird that you let this test,
decide what you're gonna be and you don't even know what it is.
It doesn't decide what I'm gonna be. It's an aptitude test.
It measures aptitude, I guess.
Okay.
-You should do what you're good at. -No, you should do what you love.
-You should do what you're good at. -No, you should do what you love. I am doing what I love.
-Why are you psychoanalyzing me? -I'm not psychoanalyzing you.
I mean, just because I'm not some badass master criminal,
doesn't mean that what I do is not important.
-I didn't say it wasn't important. -I mean, do you love a life of crime?
-Yeah, I do. -So you get a kick out of...
...taking money from hard-working, honest people.
-What is your problem? -I just--
-I don't think you should be judging me. -I'm not judging you.
I'm not the one that got picked out of a gajillion people,
...to be Miss Super-Duper Crime-Fighting Goody-Two-Shoes.
I've never been perfect at anything.
Look,
I didn't even wanna be a criminal. I wanted to be a pirate.
Pirates are criminals.
Whoops.
I wanted to go to art school.
-Art school? -In Barcelona.
-You should go, you should do it. -Maybe.
After I make the world safe from people like you.
I don't know what the test saw in me.
Everybody thinks I am gonna make this perfect spy but me.
I guess I'm proving them all wrong now.
Is that what you're doing with me?
Sabotaging your spy career?
I'm here because I feel more like me when I'm with you,
than I do when I'm with me.
Look, let's just, forget we're here, okay?
And let's pretend we're in Barcelona, you're in art school,
and I'm renting sailboats to tourists.
And nobody is a superhero, nobody is a villain, we're just us.
Max here. This better be really good.
-You are the D.E.B.S.? -Who is this?
I know where your friend is.
We've got a lead on Amy. Let's go.
Oh, no, no, no...
Get your ass over here.
We got a lead on Amy.
And no boys upstairs after curfew.
Out.
Pick up, pick up, pick up...
-My God. I'm so sorry. -Did you just snap my bra?
-No. -Yeah, you did.
-That hasn't happened since 6th grade. -I was trying to be smooth.
-What? You did it first. -You're dead.
And bingo! I am the god of Bingo.
Breach.
Bingo. Bingo. Bingo.
Bingo!
Damn it!
-Say mercy. Come on. Say mercy. -No. No. No.
-Do you give? Do you gi--? -No.
Do you love me?
Yes.
Come on.
What the hell?
I couldn't stop them.
-You look nice. -Thanks.
What?
-What are you doing? -Nothing.
Let's go.
Sorry.
Oh, God.
It is not what you think.
I hope it was worth it.
You really should check your messages.
Look, it'll be okay.
No, it won't.
This is a nightmare.
This is...This is not happening.
Are you kidding me?
We conduct a nationwide manhunt for you, and you're boning the suspect?
What did you think this was, a joke?
"Let's divert federal resources and man-hours,
so I can have my collegiate lesbian fling in style."
I was doing research.
I'll bet.
Treason. Consorting with the enemy.
Aiding and abetting.
I'm going to be the laughingstock of the entire intelligence community.
I am going to send you so far away,
that luxuries like toilet paper and Diet Coke will be as a distant dream to you.
Ms. Petrie.
Is somebody talking to me?
Because that would be extremely ill-advised right now.
Ms. Petrie, this infraction is a considerable embarrassment,
-...to you and the academy, right? -Have I not been speaking in English?
Well, there is a way that we can turn it all around.
Explain.
Make Amy D.E.B. of the year next week at endgame.
Nobody knows what happened tonight but us.
What good would it do to send Amy to Siberia? Nothing.
Your pride and joy will be disgraced, and for what?
Exactly. So here's what we're gonna do.
Tomorrow we're gonna go to class,
and we're gonna report that we rescued Amy from Lucy, just in the nick of time.
And Amy is gonna act traumatized but cool.
And she will go to endgame on Saturday with Bobby.
And she'll give a speech about how she battled Lucy,
and lived to fight another day.
And you, Ms. Petrie, will get another feather in your cap.
And we don't lose a valued member of our team.
But she's obviously in love with our nemesis.
How can I make sure she won't run off again?
Let's ask her.
The Amy that I know,
wouldn't sell out her friends and her country for some supervillain.
The Amy that I know,
she must have been brainwashed or something.
Maybe Lucy was doing some type of experiments with mind control.
Because the Amy that I know would never
Because the Amy that I know would never ever betray us like that.
You didn't know what you were doing, right?
Right.
And there's no way that you're in love with her?
No. No way.
Good.
-And you'll keep her secret? -Are you kidding?
No way I'm telling.
Perhaps we can chalk this up to the indiscretions of youth.
I underestimated you, Brewer. Good work.
I'll remember this when I review applications,
for the International Bureau.
Have Miss Bradshaw vetted for information she may have
on Diamond's whereabouts.
She is to be placed on round-the-clock lockdown,
only out for missions and class.
Be grateful you have friends who care for you.
Too bad it's more than they can say for you.
-Max-- -No.
D.E.B.S. stick together.
But do not misunderstand me, I do not forgive you.
-Max. -And you.
I don't even wanna look at you.
You let me go on this whole time believing that she was in trouble.
You can forget about that recommendation.
Well, you're not as boring as I thought,
but you are not as bright either.
-Bobby-- -Don't.
Janet, I am so sorry.
All I ever wanted was to earn my stripes.
Because I believe in it, you know? I believe in what we do.
And now...
-Where is Lucy now? -I don't know.
Are you gonna see her again?
Hey.
Hey.
So you and me going to endgame together?
Yeah. I guess.
I still love you.
I know you still love me too.
Yeah.
My dad got this on a drug bust in Malaysia
Listen, I've been thinking,
That whole lezzy thing, it's kind of hot.
See you tonight, babe.
You did the right thing.
Hey.
How do you do that?
For a top-secret installation, your security really is for shit.
-You can't be here. -Oh, I know.
You say you can't see me, and then I see you anyway.
-It's kind of this little game we play. -Get out.
Is this about your friends? Because if it is, I can just talk to them.
You know, we can work out some sort of détente.
-I said, get out. I'm warning you. -Amy.
You have to go now.
It's your stupid friends. Why don't you just think for yourself for a change.
She's gone.
Are you okay?
I thought you were different!
She thinks I'm bad news? Oh, I'll give her bad news.
-What are you doing? -Australia's toast.
-What's your beef with Australians? -I don't like their attitude.
Okay. Hey, come on.
Scud, I don't know how this happened to me, but,
being bad doesn't feel good anymore.
Do you love her?
You're willing to give up all this,
the life of crime, the whole nine yards?
Whatever it takes.
All right, then.
We're going in.
What?
We gots to get her back.
In a remarkable twist, sums of stolen money,
have been reappearing in bank accounts.
Authorities are trying to determine the location of these wire transfers,
however, have been unsuccessful at this time.
The Louvre received a surprise package this morning,
a shipment of stolen paintings estimated to be worth $15 million.
Insider sources say that the artwork was originally taken,
by notorious supervillain Lucy Diamond.
She's out there somewhere.
It's time for plan B.
-There's a plan B? -Yeah.
-Getting ready for tonight? -Hey, Mr. P.
Tell me, Amy, how are you getting along?
Okay, I guess.
You know Amy, I've found that in this business,
there isn't much room for love.
Love requires trust, and trust requires honesty.
-Mr. P., can I ask you a question? -Of course.
I got a perfect score on the secret test in the SAT.
-Yes, you did. -But...
-...what does that test measure? -I'm sorry?
I mean, Dominique is a sex addict.
Janet, she has a couple of shoplifting convictions.
Max? Well, she's borderline psychotic.
But nothing in my past indicated that I'd be good at being a spy.
So, why did I get a perfect score?
The test measures your ability to lie.
You are a perfect liar.
Don't get me wrong. Perfect liars make perfect spies.
The rest we can teach, but subterfuge, that comes naturally.
Look, have fun tonight.
Endgame only happens once a year.
Enjoy yourself.
-Okay, what's the plan? -There's security here, here and here.
We'll infiltrate through the rooftop and take out the guards here.
Go through these vents, rappel down the elevator shaft,
and then bungee-jump down to the dance floor.
Okay, check. What next?
"Tell her that you love her." Scud, that's your plan?
-That's not a plan! -War is easy. Love is hard.
Okay, so how's this?
"My tour of duty behind enemy lines,
has taught me to remain vigilant to my core values:
Bravery, loyalty and justice.
And so it is a great honor for me to accept this award..."
Blah, blah, blah.
What if she really loves her?
I mean, what if Lucy makes her happy?
If you were really her best friend, you'd probably let her go.
You can't decide matters of the heart.
It is madness to try.
It's time.
Okay, so I just wrote down a couple words,
explaining our version of what happened
and expressing your gratitude at being honored.
And... I'm sorry that we've been fighting.
It's just I really want what's best for you.
I know.
All right. Your speech.
Attention, D.E.B.S.!
Dudes!
Once in a blue moon,
an exceptional young lady comes along,
who truly exemplifies what it means to be a D.E.B.
Discipline. Energy. Beauty.
Lucy Diamond's been spotted infiltrating the--
Secure every entrance to this place, every floor.
Nobody gets in or out without my say-so.
Game over, Diamond.
I have spent my life defending this great country of ours
and I have learned one thing:
That sometimes it's not on the battlefield
where true courage is shown.
Amy Bradshaw survived one of the worst tragedies
that could happen to a young lady.
Kidnapped,
held hostage,
-Matthews here. -We're not seeing her.
Look again!
What fears she may have known, none of us can fully appreciate.
But she has agreed to tell us part of what she learned, on her journey.
It gives me great pleasure tonight to give our greatest honor,
the Mary Jane, to our very own perfect score
Amy Bradshaw!
Courage.
"Courage" is a big word.
I did not know what courage meant to me
until I endured seven agonizing days in captivity.
Go.
captured and held hostage by a madwoman.
-Report. -We've got nothing here.
It was a routine mission gone terribly wrong.
I was separated from my squad and knocked unconscious.
I awoke in the arms of the enemy.
Just the sound of my own desperate thoughts to keep me company.
If there is corruption in this city, Lucy Diamond is behind it.
If there is indecency to be found, she is the root.
If there is evil in this world, its name is Lucy Diamond.
It's not until moments like this
when you are forced to take stock of yourself
that you see what you are made of.
It's not until moments like this
when you have to remember what's right and true
because it's moments like this when you discover
what it truly means to be a D.E.B.
Which is why I can't accept this award from you tonight.
Because the truth is
the time I spent with Lucy Diamond were the happiest days of my life.
And the only brave thing I've done this whole time
is what I'm doing now.
So if you'll excuse me
I have a date with the devil.
-Oh, my God! -Was that in the speech?
No, that's not in the speech.
Son of a--
Hostile has escaped and is on the run heading towards sector 12.
It's Lucy Diamond! She's here!
Everybody, run for your lives!
Let's do this.
-We've gotta stop meeting like this. -I'm so sorry. I didn't even know what--
Get a room.
-You are AWOL, soldier. -Max, please.
-Freeze! -Scud! -Yeah? -Not helping!
-My bad. -Can't you see... ...she's breaking up the D.E.B.S.?
What did I tell you the first time I met you?
High-protein diets were overrated.
After that.
-That we'd always be friends. -I meant it.
Max!
If you break her heart, I will hunt you down and kill you.
Deal.
I'm counting on you to keep her honest.
I will.
You guys better get going.
I never really liked you but I'm sad to see you go.
-So where are you going to? -I think, Barcelona.
I'll miss you.
-Can I have your room? -Sure.
Okay.
Rule the school.
I always do.
There's a service exit that way.
Good luck.
And, Amy,
be careful.
-Which way did they go? -They went that way.
-Don't say I never gave you nothing. -My stripes?
-Really? -Really.
-Thank you! -You're welcome.
Okay, okay. That's enough, that's enough.
Okay.
So, I was wondering if maybe you wanted--
Yes!
I didn't ask you anything yet.
You've promised us new drugs to fight everything from the common cold to cancer.
And we'll deliver everything that we promised. I'm sorry, Gordon, but the adventure is over.
We are exercising our option to liquidate
Byron & Mitchell Research Limited.
Jack...show these people how filthy rich we're gonna make them, please.
Gordon, I don't think you understand what I just said.
Oh, I think I understand.
Jack.
JACK: Perrinia immortalis.
The Blood Orchid.
First described in 1892 by Houghton,
the last person to see it, until our exploratory team brought a sample back from Borneo.
The Blood Orchid lies dormant for seven years and then blooms for just six months.
Which means we just got lucky as hell, gentlemen.
JACK: I don't suppose anyone here is familiar with the Hayflick limit?
Hayflick proposed that a cell could only replicate 56 times
before it died from a buildup of toxins.
According to him, it's the reason that we die.
But what if we could transcend that limit?
That would be impossible.
Not according to our data.
Our research indicates the presence of a chemical in perrinia immortalis
that can significantly prolong cellular life.
GAIL: I can't support this.
Does that mean what I think it means?
Are we talking about a pharmaceutical equivalent
to the fountain of youth?
Exactly.
That'd be bigger than Viagra.
Have you put this into human trials? We can't...yet.
Our sample was degraded in the initial study. We need more of the orchid.
We need more of the orchid.
See, and that's our only problem, gentlemen.
That orchid is only in bloom for another two weeks.
Well, what the hell are you waiting for?
Get your asses down to Borneo.
Yes.
Welcome to Borneo. Thanks.
What's wrong with this picture? I don't know. Let me see. You're in it?
We don't have a boat, okay?
Your company's had one responsibility, to get a boat,
and you've already managed to screw it up. Wait, wait, wait a minute. Your girl chartered the boat, not us.
No, no. Sam confirmed with the company last night. They're still waiting for your payment.
SAM: Hey.
Hey, I've got something. Payment cleared.
Really?
Where's the boat? It's not coming.
All of the charter companies have shut down.
No one'll risk goin' upriver until after the rainy season.
And when's that? Two, three weeks.
The orchid's only in bloom for one more week, tops.
There's a local captain named Jin-Soon.
I'm told he'll take anyone upriver, for the right price.
Are you sure this is the place?
They said the one with the red door.
I'll bet you any kind of money there's somebody playing Russian roulette in there.
Well, maybe we'll get lucky and they'll give you a turn.
JACK: Hey, why don't you two just get a room? Come on, Sam.
Wait here.
Yeah, if you insist.
Hey. Hey.
Jin-Soon.
Jin-Soon?
Your Indonesian sucks.
Stick to English. We heard you could take us upriver.
In rainy season?
Won't be cheap. We can pay you 25,000.
We can pay you 25,000.
I'll have a talk with the captain. Well, you mean you're not the captain?
Jin-Soon!
These tourists need a boat. I told them not in the rainy season.
You're Jin-Soon? Local nickname. Name's Johnson.
Name's Johnson. Bill Johnson.
It's a pronunciation thing.
And you can rent my boat for 25 grand.
Now...you want me to drive it, well...
that'll cost you 50.
Fifty grand? Are you high?
You know what? Please don't answer that question.
You know what? Please don't answer that question. There's no way I'm trusting this guy with the expedition.
Listen, lady. Let's cut the bullshit, please.
If one of the other charter companies could take you,
you'd be on the river by now.
You only came to me because you're desperate.
Fifty grand's my price.
Take it...
or leave it.
I've seen subway cars in better shape than this.
Yeah, she may be ugly...
but she puts out.
Ah, shit. What took you so long?
Hey, you try gettin' a GPS locator, a Sat-Nav EchoStar, and a UV spectrometer
a Sat-Nav EchoStar, and a UV spectrometer past Indonesian customs.
Complaining already. Yeah.
Rather be back in the office? Hell, yeah.
Girl, I had courtside seats at the Garden Saturday night.
I was gonna sit right between Spike and Woody.
Oh, man, is that our ride?
Look at the bright side, Cole. At least the weather's nice.
Ben Douglas. Team doctor. You must be Sam.
Yeah. We spoke on the phone.
Glad to have you aboard.
I'm gonna get you for this.
BEN: Oh, yeah. This could be fun.
You can forget about that, dog.
That's one car you ain't never gonna catch.
There's always a way.
Your team's a little green, huh? My former grad students.
Best in their field.
Here's a tip for Wexell-Hall.
You want the best young talent, recruit early.
GAIL: Yes, I'm sure Sam's very talented.
I think I resent that.
You and the other gal can stay in here.
You live here?
The way you say that, I can tell you're impressed.
All right.
If you need anything...
Well, if you need anything, you're shit out of luck.
Okay.
Now, this is where the exploratory team found the orchid.
In the Selatan Basin.
It took them three days to get upriver. Yeah.
Well, that was before the rainy season.
Some of these waterways could be dangerous now.
could be dangerous now. You said you could get us there safely. And I will,
but safe isn't always quick.
We'll work our way upriver one bend at a time.
If I don't like what I see, we change course. You can't chart the fastest route
You can't chart the fastest route before you begin.
Already have.
Check it. A'ight.
Now, we're uplinked in real time to NASA and AsiaSatCom.
Now, under ideal conditions, [TYPING] this is the fastest route,
this is the fastest route,
but once we superimpose weather patterns for the past 10 years
for the past 10 years and then extrapolate...
Bingo. It's Padrang to the Selatan Basin.
I'm a bad man.
Look, we got less than a week to get to that orchid.
If you can't get the job done... give us our money back
and we'll get somebody who can. I'll get you there.
God help me.
Something attacked me! Something is in there!
Oh, my God! Man, she said something attacked her.
No, no, no, no!
BILL [GENTLY]: It's okay, boy. It's okay.
What the hell did you do? You scared him.
I scared him?
This is Kong.
This is Kong. Kong lives here.
You're... guests.
Be nice.
Disgusting animal.
Uh, you-- You okay now?
I'm fine. Just keep your hands off of me.
Oh, yeah, well, it's gonna be tough, but, uh, I'll try.
No, the S-1 has to be on file before the week is out. Hello! Yeah.
No, I don't care. That's the whole point. Hello?
Hello? The S-1 needs to be on file before the week is out. We were able to get on the river.
That's the whole purpose. We need the comments back from the SEC.
Uh-huh. Yeah. Excuse me. I'm trying. It's the only place I get reception.
No, just get it done. We need to be ready to go, effective as-- Three, four days.
Hello? Hello? Hello! Bob. Damn it. Damn.
Try my phone.
Works just as good, but it's free.
Oh, okay. Okay, maybe you can use my special antenna, to boost your reception.
JACK: We're dealing with a lithophytic vine, so we want to search any rock face.
Now, this ridge here seems a good bet. Sam.
Sam.
Come on, Sam.
What do you say? We're young, we're single. We're in Borneo.
What do you got to lose?
You're not satisfied, you walk away, no commitments.
"No commitments."
That's your pitch?
Did I say, "No commitments"? I meant, "Marry me."
Am I gonna be dealing with this for the next two weeks?
Yep.
So you were one of Jack's students?
Yeah. He was teaching a seminar on botanical pharmacology.
Soon as I finished my dissertation, he hired me.
Well, that's one way to get a leg up.
What's that supposed to mean?
I had a professor who wanted to hire me right out of school.
who wanted to hire me right out of school. Of course, he wanted me to be his secretary.
Look, if I've done something to offend you in any way--
No. No, dear, not at all.
Actually, I admire you. Took me 10 years to get where I am.
Clearly, your generation has it figured out.
Man. This is good, man. Where'd you learn to cook like this?
It's just a little recipe I picked up in Sri Lanka. What were you doing there?
Doctors Without Borders.
It's my day job.
You guys expect to need a doctor for some reason?
Can't get the expedition bonded without one.
Can't get the expedition bonded without one. Well, you just think of me as a charming insurance policy.
Hey!
You've had your dinner.
Get outta here.
Ah. What'd I say?
COLE: I'm serious. I'm not sleeping up here tonight...
I ain't sleeping with no damn monkey.
Oh, shit. What was that? What the hell was that?
Something's getting eaten. By what?
Everything gets eaten out here.
It's the jungle.
Kong.
Hey, you guys seen Kong? No.
Not since last night.
Where are you?
Kong. Ch-ch-ch-ch.
We need those results by next month if we want the FDA off our backs.
Hello? H-- Shit.
I can't hear you.
Can you hear me now?
How about now?
[SHOUTING] Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now? We can.
Can you hear me now?
Oh, shit! Gail, oh, my God. Shit.
Stop the boat!
I'll go. All right.
Hey, Gail! Can you hear me now?
Oh. Oh, I'm going to kill you!
COLE: Stroke, Gail, stroke! Come on!
BILL: Watch your back. Come on, stroke! MITCHELL: Hey, Gail! How's the water?
Maybe you should drop the phone. It's probably holding you back.
All right. Stay calm, Gail. Come on.
Stay calm, Gail. Come on. MITCHELL: Use your phone as a flotation device.
JACK: All right, come on, Gail.
You're almost there, Gail. MITCHELL: Come on, it's just like a phone.
I got it.
Holy shit! Holy shit!
Come on! Come on!
Get out! SAM: Hurry up!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Come on! Come on! Gail, grab it!
Look out! Look out!
Oh, my God!
COLE: Get him, man! Get him, man! Get him in the eye, man!
Bill?
Where'd he go?
Bill! Where'd he go?
I don't see him. Where's he gone?
Where's he gone? Oh, my God.
Oh, shit, you won!
You okay? I lost my phone.
Sorry to hear it.
That was either the bravest... or the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
It's a fine line.
Good as new. Thanks.
To Gail...
who knows it's better to eat than be eaten.
Yeah, yeah, baby. To Gail. To Gail.
Almost eaten just to find a flower.
Hardly seems worth it. Oh, it's worth it.
I mean, think about it, right?
A pill that you take every day for the rest of your life.
Now, even if we charge, say, a dollar a pop...
...we're billionaires.
COLE: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, baby. At $100 a bottle,
I'll dive in that river and fight that croc myself.
So how many flowers does it take to save the world?
We figure 50 orchids'll yield about an ounce of chemical.
You could have a football field full of those orchids.
Still doesn't mean you can get it through human trials. Phew.
She doesn't even believe in you. Comes with the territory.
Comes with the territory.
In research, you've got to go out on a limb, and there's always someone waiting to chop it off.
and there's always someone waiting to chop it off.
Where the hell have you been, huh?
Damn that thing. Where you been, boy?
[SQUAWKING] Calm down. Calm down.
Poor guy. It's okay. It's all right.
Looks like he's seen a ghost.
It's all right. It's all right. [WHIMPERING] It's all right. Shh.
SAM: What if Gail's right?
I mean, cells in a petri dish are one thing.
Human trials are another. She's wrong,
and when perrinia immortalis goes to product,
and you and I can cash in our stock options,
we'll rub her face in it. Stock options.
I spoke to Mitchell.
We're each giving you half a point.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
You deserve it.
All this...
wouldn't be possible without your work.
Jack.
Thought we decided against that.
Yeah. Yeah.
You're right. It would be fun, though.
I mean, here we are, traveling upriver
to the greatest discovery of our careers and...
Now, if this orchid thing works out, then...
who knows?
Is that why I'm here?
So you can give us one more try?
You're here because you're the best researcher I've got.
BILL: Am I interrupting something?
No. I was, um... I was just going to bed.
I was, um... I was just going to bed. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, before you do that, we need to talk.
We got a problem. See the water level?
Uh-huh.
In high water, the Mendranang gets rough. Now, what we could do is turn around
Now, what we could do is turn around and try to find another course,
but that would take at least two days. We don't have the time.
If the river becomes impassable, it's gonna take a lot longer.
And if we turn back, then we're definitely screwed. You're gonna have to risk it.
You're gonna have to risk it.
What if I don't wanna risk it?
Do you have any idea what this flower means? We're talking about the biggest medical discovery
We're talking about the biggest medical discovery in history. Wow.
That does sound great, Jack,
but I was never any good at history.
You want me to risk the Mendranang, it's gonna cost you an extra 50,000.
it's gonna cost you an extra 50,000.
Done.
Done?
Don't you gotta ask the boss lady or something?
I'll pay it myself.
All right.
You got yourself a deal.
But if we hit trouble,
your people do what I say, you got that?
You're the captain.
Research proposals?
Yeah, research proposals.
You're not the only company we're in bed with.
Yeah, but we're the prettiest and most popular.
It's like sleeping with the head cheerleader.
Not quite.
Come on, you know you love us.
I love your cash.
Then why don't you let me get a look at that file?
I mean, after this orchid thing goes bust, you're gonna be finished at Wexell-Hall.
Unless you got something else lined up.
You really wanna see us fail, don't you?
No.
I just think that you will. I am a scientist, you know.
Scientist.
What're you doing at Wexell-Hall?
I like science.
I just like money better.
I'll drink to that.
River's flooded. Can't see the banks.
Miss our turnoff?
It's just ahead.
What the hell was that?
Rudder's jammed. What? Watch out.
What? Watch out.
Shit!
Get up! Everybody, up!
Hey.
MITCHELL: What's going on?
BILL: Goddamn it.
Shit. I've blown that gasket.
Are we all right?
Hey, what's going on?
What is it? We got problems.
What's wrong, man? Bill...
Rudder's shot.
Son of a bitch. Current's too strong.
We missed our turnoff. I know. Come on, baby.
BEN: Come on, man.
MITCHELL: What is it? COLE: Wh-what is it?
MITCHELL: What do you see?
Come on.
You got this. Come on, girl.
Everybody, hang on! COLE: Hang on to what?!
Come on!
Oh!
Holy shit.
TRAN: It's sinking, it's sinking!
Where's Cole? Swim to the rocks, this way.
Where's Cole? Cole!
Where's Cole? Cole! Over there! Over... Over there.
Over there! Over... Over there.
COLE: Come on, man. Give me your hand!
JACK: Come on.
You got it, Sam. Come on.
Give me your hand. I've got you, I've got you. Whoa.
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.
Okay, I've got her.
You almost got us killed!
You think I wanted this? I just lost my damn boat!
You'll lose your payday if you don't get us outta this.
You said you'd get us there safely. If you knew it was that dangerous,
you should've turned around! That's enough!
There's nothing we can do about that now.
It's a waste of energy.
What have we got?
Some specimen jars, a map, a little water, no food.
Hard drive's ruined.
Well, pretty much all the equipment's shot.
Except one of the SAT phones still works. It's online.
Thank God we can call the police.
[SCOFFS] Police. The nearest river patrol is back in Padrang.
The only way to get to us is over that. Are you saying we're stuck here?
Are you saying we're stuck here?
Maybe not.
We're here, The valley's completely flooded.
But I got a friend who operates a boat on the Tokut River.
I can give him a call, and he can meet us here, at Naga Rock.
How far is that?
I don't know, a two-day hike down the river,
but if we bushwhack, we cut at least a day off the trek. Oh, my God, you wanna go through that?
Oh, my God, you wanna go through that? It's the shortest way.
It's the shortest way.
We could be safely in the Tokut by nightfall.
So we can continue with the expedition.
Yeah. I'll get you to the flower. I don't care about that flower.
Just get us to safety. It's the same thing.
Now, we can either be on my buddy's boat in 10 hours, or we can sit here
and wait for the river patrol for days.
Your friend. Is he reliable?
Absolutely.
BILL [OVER PHONE]: You better not screw me on this.
Sounds like you're already screwed, mate.
I'll pay you two grand.
I need you on this one, John.
Yes, yes, so it seems. Uh...
Look, uh, Billy, I'd love to help you out, but, uh... I'm flat out, mate, you know? Um...
probably squeeze you in for, say... five grand?
You're killing me. Ha, that's mates' rates.
Ha, that's mates' rates. Or you could always hike
back to Padrang if you wanna save bucks.
Up to you, pal. Fine. Five.
[WHISPERS] Yes. But you better be there.
Otherwise, I'll tell your wife about that little side trip to Bangkok.
Wife's long gone, Billy.
Long gone, mate.
All right, people, we're on. Saddle up.
Stay together. This jungle is all green all the time, and you will get lost.
It's like doing a StairMaster in a sauna.
Yeah. I might die of a heat stroke, but I'll have a nice tight ass.
That's the spirit, Cole.
You want me to grab that? Is that a trick question?
Here, man.
Right between Spike and Woody.
Right between Spike and Woody.
You okay, Sam?
I'm fine.
See, a crisis separates the real men from the pretenders.
Yeah. I can see that.
What, that? That's nothing.
That's nothing.
[PANTING] I tricked him into taking my bag.
Hey. Mind if I give it a try?
Knock yourself out.
Hey.
I'm sorry about your boat.
Yeah, well...
it was a piece of shit anyway.
Can we go around?
Yeah, we could. But we'd lose another day. GAIL: Aw.
Let's go.
GAIL: Shit.
Hey. Knock it off.
Shit! What--? What was that? What was what?
Something just moved. Oh, please don't say that.
No, I'm serious. Something just moved past me.
MITCHELL: Something just moved, as in something's alive? Yeah, man-- Shit! Shit!
Yo, there it is again. There's something in here.
Cole, there's probably a million things in here. BILL: He's right.
BILL: He's right. Just keep moving.
Stop it.
I swear to God, if you don't stop it...
Very funny.
Ben?
Where'd he go? Shit!
Help me!
Run!
COLE: What the hell was that thing? BILL: Anaconda. Oh, great!
GAIL: There's snakes out here that big?
Yes, but there's no w-- But what? That thing swallowed him whole!
Calm down and listen a second. No, no, no.
I can explain to you-- No, you calm down and listen! Ben was eaten by a freaking snake, okay?
A freaking snake! Cole. Oh, God! Oh, God!
Cole. Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God, I mean--
Cole. Oh, my God, did you--? Did you see that thing?
We don't got a chance against something like that!
I mean, Mitchell. Mitchell. Listen to me, man.
I watch the Discovery Channel, okay? I'm telling you. We got no chance! We got no chance!
We're like-- We're like mice in an aquarium.
We're gonna die, girl. We're gonna die!
We're gonna die! Cole, Cole. Calm down. Okay?
Okay? All right, Jack, I'm okay. Okay. Okay.
All right, Jack, I'm okay. Okay. Okay.
I'll just--
I'm-- I'm-- I'm gonna-- I'm gonna sit right here, I'm sorry. Sorry.
Listen. Anacondas are territorial.
A snake that size will hunt a huge area.
There won't be another one for miles.
We gotta get to the boat. It's not that far,
so if we keep moving and stick together,
we should be fine. "We should be"?
How big do they get?
That was the biggest one I've ever seen, by far. A freak of nature.
The odds of running into another one that size are astronomical.
Yeah, but how do we know that the one that got Ben
is not gonna come after us? It takes them weeks to digest.
It takes them weeks to digest.
Meal like that, he'll be sleeping it off for a while.
Let's just, um... get to that boat and get home.
What about the orchid?
You've gotta be kidding me.
It won't be in bloom for another seven years.
This expedition is over, Jack. Now, hold on a second, Gail.
There's a lot of money at stake here, okay? I don't care! Ben is dead!
We have lost someone.
As Wexell-Hall's representative, I am calling this expedition off.
You don't have the authority. Check your contract. In case you hadn't noticed,
we're in the middle of the jungle.
At this point, your authority is what we say it is.
Jack, I'm with her. I gotta get the hell outta here, man.
Look, Ben was my friend, okay? I got him into this,
and no one feels worse about it than I do.
I don't want to do anything stupid.
I just want to accomplish what we came here for.
If we turn back now, Ben's death would be for nothing.
Let's just get back to the boat.
We can regroup and make our decision then.
Fine.
[QUIETLY] Jack, maybe Gail's right.
[QUIETLY] Jack, maybe Gail's right. She's just scared.
Once we get back to the boat, she'll be okay.
When we get back to the boat, this expedition is over.
The only place I'm taking these people is to safety.
Hey, hey, hey. We had a deal.
Keep your money, doc. Someone is dead.
We're officially in over our heads.
You just said we won't run into another one of those things.
And we probably won't, but I can't guarantee it.
So I'll get you to the boat,
but after that, we're done.
Well, that answers it.
That answers nothing. I'll just throw more money at him when we get back to the boat.
If he doesn't take it, I'll offer his friend the same deal.
Jack, maybe we should listen-- Sam, if we don't get to that orchid now,
all of our work would've been for nothing.
I need your support, okay? You have as much riding on this as I do.
Don't let me down.
COLE: I saw this special on Animal Planet. Anacondas are vicious, man. I mean, they hunt for sport.
They don't even need to see you to eat you.
They use their flicking tongues to sense your body heat. GAIL: Will you shut the hell up?
GAIL: Will you shut the hell up? I knew this guy who knew this other guy
I knew this guy who knew this other guy who used to shoot documentaries,
and he went down to the Amazon with this crew once, they were all eaten by snakes, and that's a true story.
You knew a guy who knew a guy, that's a urban myth.
I'm sorry about Ben.
I never should've stayed on the Mendranang.
What do you mean? Well, I figured he didn't tell the others,
Well, I figured he didn't tell the others, but I thought you knew.
Knew what?
Byron offered me an extra 50 grand to stay on the river.
I told him it might get rough, but he wanted to risk it.
[SCOFFS] Hey. Don't blame him.
It was my call.
I took the money.
I thought I could get us through.
You want to blame anyone? You blame me.
MITCHELL: These boots are killing me.
Cole. What?
You got some...
Oh! Oh, God, what is that! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!
Oh, my God! I can't get it off!
Help me! Help me! Help me! All right, hold on. Hey!
Get this off me! Calm down! Calm down.
Calm down! Calm down.
Cole! Cole!
Calm down. What is it? What is it?
Get it off. Get it off. All right, look-- Get it off.
Just a lighter. Oh, no! You ain't burning me. Just a lighter.
COLE: Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
You burn me, I'll kill you. Shh. Shh.
Shh. Shh. Okay. Okay. All right.
All right? You okay? Yeah. I'm fine.
BILL: Uh... COLE: What? BILL: Hold on. Put your arms up.
Put your arms up. What are you doing?
Why are you going under my shirt?
BILL: Jesus. COLE: "Jesus" what?
What? What is it?
What is it? What is it?
Anybody got a blowtorch?
Stop.
Careful.
What's... If that thing bit you,
you would be lumpuh.
Paralyzed like stone for two days.
JACK: What do you call this fellow? Laba laba batu. Stone spider.
We may have just discovered a valuable new anesthetic agent for Wexell-Hall.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Forget Wexell. We can get this to the highest bidder.
All right. Show and tell's over.
We gotta get to that boat. Put your boots on and let's go.
Bugger it.
What the hell was that?
Holy bloody hell.
COLE: Whoa! Wh-what was that?
Oh, my God.
What the hell was that?
Come on.
COLE: No, no, no, no! Oh, come on, man!
What the hell happened?
Livingston!
JACK: Here we go.
He got drunk and fell off the bloody boat!
Your friend! Your friend! Now, what we gonna do now?
COLE: Shit!
Search the wreckage.
Find anything we can use...
and hope to God there's a phone.
Aw, come on, come on.
Aw, come on, come on. Yes.
COLE: Hello?
Hello?
Come on, come on. Anything? Nothing.
Keep trying.
What do you think I'm doing, Jack?
Hello? Shit.
Hello? Come on, man.
Hello?
MITCHELL: All right, keep looking!
No phone? Nothing.
Nothing. Couldn't get a signal on the radio.
Now what?
COLE: What's going on?
BILL: Where'd these come from?
Lopaks. Who?
Local tribe,
descended from headhunters. What?
Been in this region for thousands of years.
Headhunters? There's still some villages around here.
Yeah, this must be one of their fishing spots. No. Excuse me. Did you say headhunters?
No. Excuse me. Did you say headhunters?
There haven't been practicing headhunters in Borneo for over a century.
Yeah, well, just because they ain't practicing, don't mean they don't remember how.
They must be along this branch of the river.
If we can find their village... maybe they can lend us a boat.
COLE: So wait a minute. We just gonna walk towards the headhunters, not away?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
Oh, God. I'm so hungry, I'd sell my grandmother for a Tic Tac.
You mention food one more time,
I'm voting you off this island.
MITCHELL: Oh, God.
Is that--? Livingston.
Oh, my God, man. What the...? What the hell happened to him?
Anaconda.
If he was eaten by the snake, then why is his body--?
If he was eaten by the snake, then why is his body--? Listen, listen, listen!
All right. These things are at their weakest when they digest,
but if threatened, they will spit up their food and attack again.
COLE: What? Are you telling me there's some snake out there with an empty stomach?
Yeah. The same one that got Ben?
No. No. There's no way that snake could've gotten to Livingston.
It had to be another one. Another one? You said there wouldn't be another for miles--
There wouldn't.
Unless... Unless what?
Unless it's mating season. Oh, my God.
Mating season? Yeah. Oh, my God.
You see, the males are territorial, but when they smell a female in heat,
they come running... from everywhere.
TRAN: Females find a nice, wet, muddy pit, and they all go after her at once.
in one big mating ball. So you're telling me
there's some snake orgy out in the jungle?
Yeah. Something like that.
Look, we're losing the light.
All we gotta do is get to that village, so please, pay attention.
Do not... stray from the group.
Let's go.
TRAN: Stay quiet. Sacred burial ground.
Jesus.
I thought you said that anaconda was the biggest you'd ever seen.
It was.
Well, this one's... Bigger.
The males must've come through here looking for the female.
Some bullshit.
They took their boats. BEN: Good for them,
bad for us.
Which one's the Mendranang? On the right.
On the right. The Tokut keeps going to the left.
Fastest way to Kotabaru. How long?
You'll be soaking in a hot tub at the Four Seasons in two days.
How, man? We don't even have a boat.
We're gonna build one.
Man, do that in my neighborhood, and that's your ass.
Shit.
Sam.
What does this look like to you?
My God.
Perrinia immortalis.
Now we know why these snakes are so big.
What?
Anacondas keep growing till they die, right? Uh-huh. And these are the biggest snakes
Uh-huh. And these are the biggest snakes Bill's ever seen.
Because they're living longer. Exactly,
because perrinia immortalis is part of the food chain.
These snakes have transcended the Hayflick limit.
The chemical in the orchid does exactly what we predicted,
and not in theory. In the real world.
This is proof, Sam, of your research, carved in stone.
This is proof?
It's anecdotal evidence at best.
Let's get to the orchid and find out. You are out of your mind. Do you have any idea how close we are?
Do you have any idea how close we are?
The orchid was found here, on the Mendranang,
just around the next bend.
We'll be going right past it. No, we won't.
No, we won't. We are going down the Tokut.
If we continue down the Mendranang, it's gonna be a week
before we reach another village. I'm not waiting that long for my bath.
Yeah, well, it's not up to you.
Jack.
Maybe we can just come back.
Come back?
In seven years? What if it's not here?
What if some local farmer decides to slash and burn the entire basin? Instead of the fountain of youth,
Instead of the fountain of youth, we'll have a giant rice paddy.
This is our only chance. You know it is.
Do you really wanna give in, now we're this close?
Look... you know I got your back, right?
We've been in the trenches a hundred times together...
but I'm not going in that jungle. Damn straight, man.
Thank you.
This is my expedition, and we're going to the orchid.
No.
We're not.
Don't be an idiot, Sam.
This is bigger than penicillin, for God's sake. Your lives will be saved by this drug.
Your lives will be saved by this drug.
People will live longer, we'll stay young longer.
If we don't put this to human trials, it's gonna be a crime against humanity.
Two people have died already.
Scientists have always risked their lives to change the world.
If they didn't, we wouldn't have cures for yellow fever, polio and smallpox.
We all knew the risks. We thought we did,
until you decided to start making decisions behind our backs.
What're you talking about? He offered Bill an extra 50 grand to keep going up the Mendranang,
to keep going up the Mendranang, even though he knew it wasn't safe.
[QUIETLY] Oh, my God.
Is that true, Jack?
I was thinking of the expedition. You were thinking of your career.
Look... ...you're my assistant.
I don't need to consult you!
I'm the one with authority here.
We're in the middle of the jungle, Jack.
At this point, your authority is what we say it is.
Guess you got a mutiny on your hands.
Thank you.
Okay. Keep it high.
Careful.
Center it right here.
All right.
What're you doing?
Never seen a man shave before?
Probably a lot sharper before you attacked that alligator.
Crocodile.
What's that mean?
That means "a new beginning." It's Korean.
I got it when I was in the military.
What brought you here?
Long story. Where am I gonna go?
All right.
Here's the deal. I was in the Special Forces.
And I saw and did things that...
and did things that... I wanted to forget.
Sometimes we do the wrong things for the right reasons, you know?
That's not very long, as stories go.
Yeah.
Well...I got out of the military,
came here, and bought The Bloody Mary.
Just wanted to... start a new life.
Thank you, Jack.
TRAN: On three. Ready?
TRAN: On three. Ready? One, two, three.
It works. Whoo!
SAM: All right.
Let me explain.
Why in the hell didn't you tell me about this?
The minute someone makes a call,
this expedition's over.
Exactly.
All I'm asking for is a few more hours.
We continue on the Mendranang,
take our orchid samples, then we call for help.
Forget about it, Jack, all right? I'm getting us outta here.
Think about this, Gordon.
You're about to become a billionaire. Do you really wanna give all that up?
I don't care about the money, all right?
I want to live.
[GASPS] It bit me.
Jack, what're you--?
What're you...?
[WEAKLY] Help.
Help.
SAM: Where's Mitchell?
Resting his feet.
Should I go get him? No, no.
Let him rest till we get everything loaded. Okay.
Those blisters are pretty nasty.
Mitchell.
You okay?
Mitchell?
What is it?
[GAGS] Tell me.
What did you do to him, Jack?
What is it? Something's wrong with Mitchell.
What're you talking about? You were in there alone with him.
What did you do?
He was resting his feet. I didn't do anything.
Shit. Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Gail, no! Stop!
Get out! No! No! Get out! Go!
COLE: Come on! Come on!
COLE: Move! Go!
The raft!
COLE: Nooooo! You son of a bitch!
We can build another one.
With what? With what, Sam?
BILL: We gotta get to the raft.
It's our only way outta here. FYI, Bill, the raft is gone!
We can get it back. How? Huh?
How? We gonna-- We gonna swim after it now?
Look.
The village is here.
Jack is following the Mendranang.
We cut across the jungle.
We can catch him on the other side. Right.
Catch him where? He's going to that orchid.
We find that flower...
...we find that raft.
Oh, thank God. It's, uh... It's Jack Byron.
Listen, something terrible has happened. We-- We took the wrong way on the Mendranang.
We-- We took the wrong way on the Mendranang.
We-- We went over a waterfall.
I haven't seen anyone since. I am...
I think I'm the only one left.
Wait, wait. Shh, shh. Listen.
Oh, shit. Come on!
It's in front of us.
Son of a bitch. It's trying to separate us.
Oh, shit.
Oh, Christ, it's everywhere. [WHISPERS] Turn that goddamn thing off. They can see it.
[WHISPERS] Turn that goddamn thing off. They can see it. Doesn't matter. They can sense our body heat.
Doesn't matter. They can sense our body heat. He's right. Let's just get the hell outta here.
He's right. Let's just get the hell outta here.
Which way? Hold on.
Any way! Which way?
Which way? Okay, okay, okay! Wait for me!
Okay, okay, okay! Wait for me! Come on!
Hold on, wait for me!
Oh. Oh, my God.
If there's a way in, there's a way out.
Oh, shit!
Guys?
Which way?
Which way? GAIL: Over here!
GAIL: Over here! All right, say it again! Say it again! Cole! Over here!
Over here! Cole!
Hello?
Guys?
Oh, God.
Come on.
Cole!
No, no, no, no! No!
Stay together.
O-- Okay. I promise. Now, can we please go?
Let's go. No problem. Okay. Okay.
Which way?
I don't know. What?
What do you mean, you don't know?
I found you, didn't I?
Tran?
Tran!
Tran!
Say something!
Oh, shit! Guys! Guys!
I can see light.
Is it a way out? I don't know.
Cole!
Tran!
Can you hear me?
Cole!
Where are you?
I think I found a way out.
Take this. Go. Now.
Where are they? Go.
Oh, my God.
Go.
COLE: Help! Cole?
Hey! Cole? Hey, right here!
Almost there.
Holy shit!
Move! It's coming up my ass!
Help me! What did I do?
Wait. Cole!
Cole! Come on!
Give me your hand. Come on! Oh, God! I'm stuck!
Give me your-- I'm stuck! All right. I'm stuck!
Pull me, man! Hurry up! Come on!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's coming! It's coming!
That's what I'm talking about! That's what I'm talking about, Sam!
Oh, my God! You're the bomb, Sam! You Lorena Bobbitt-ed that ass!
How you like her now, bitch? Huh?
She sliced you! She diced you! She cut you up!
That was like Sam with the samurai action!
Hell, no.
Cole!
Get up, Cole. Get up, man. Wake up.
Come on, man. Wake up.
No. No. No. No.
SAM: He's not breathing.
Give him air! Give him air!
Okay. Okay.
Again! Again!
Come on, wake up! Don't you die! [SOBBING] Don't die!
[SOBBING] Don't die! Come on, no!
What the fuck?! Get it off me!
Keep him down! No, no, no! It's okay! It's okay!
You're okay. I'm okay?
Yeah. Yeah. You're okay.
Perrinia immortalis.
Son of a bitch finally got his orchid. SAM: Yeah, he can have 'em.
All I care about is that raft.
Let's go.
Oh, my God. Thank God.
I think I know what happened to Mitchell.
I can't let you take that.
You guys look like hell.
You don't know what hell is. Oh, I'm sorry,
but you gave me no choice. Did you give Mitchell a choice before you killed him?
Did you give Mitchell a choice before you killed him? I didn't kill Mitchell.
No.
You just let him die.
I saw the spider bite on his arm.
What was I supposed to do, Sam? Huh?
The right thing? It's always a good place to start.
Let's not be stupid about this.
Let's get to the flower, and we can all go home.
The mating ball.
Gimme the flare.
Tie him up.
Now!
Fill it up. You gotta be kidding me.
Do I look like I'm kidding? Fill it up!
Get up!
Now get the flowers! [SOBS] Okay.
Throw me the pack.
Drop the gun!
Throw me the pack.
COLE: Get up, Bill! Get up!
Come on, man!
Get up!
Get up!
Sam! Sam! Come on! Come on!
Come on, come on, girl! Hurry up! Come on! Come on!
GAIL: Sam, come on! Hurry up, hurry up! Sam!
Come on! Come on! Come on, baby, come on! Aah!
Shit!
Come on, baby! You got it! Come on!
You're almost there!
Spider. Reach for me!
Come on, Sam, please! Just reach! Reach!
Give me your hand.
Come on! Right here!
COLE: No! No!
Oh, my God!
Come on, Sam! Come on!
Keep coming!
Climb on that log, Sam!
Keep coming! Come on, girl!
Come on! I got you!
Come on, Sam!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh!
Hey!
Over here, bitch!
Holy shit.
Nice shot.
What can I say? I'm a bad man.
I'm a bad man.
Wow, you two look like you made up.
He's not so bad.
How's that?
Much better.
I think I'll live.
Good.
It's kinda nice having you around.
So... how much further to my bath?
Kotabaru? I'd say...
another day downriver. Whoa, another day?
Oh, I'm not rowing another day, homeboy. BILL: All right.

I am. Where can we talk?
There’s a company you did the books for on Lipowa Street.
Made what? Pots and pans?
By law, I have to tell you, sir, I’m a Jew.
Well, I’m a German. So there we are.
Modestly successful. A good company, you think?
I know nothing about enamelware. Do you?
I was just the accountant.
Simple engineering though, wouldn’t you think?
Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn’t you?
Field kits, mess kits. Army contracts.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it’s great.
You can make a fortune, don’t you think?
I think most people right now have other priorities.

I’m sure you’ll do just fine once you get the contracts.

The standard SS rate for Jewish skilled laborers is seven marks a day,
five for unskilled and women.
This is what you pay the Reich Economic Office.
The Jews themselves receive nothing.
The Poles you pay wages. Generally, they get a little more.

The Jewish worker’s salary– You pay it directly to the SS, not the worker. He gets nothing.

Hello? Miss Elsa Krause is here. I only need five minutes.
She wants to speak to the Herr Direktor.
Yes.
He won’t see you.
Please, sit down.
Uh, no. No, thank you. Pernod? Cognac?
So, what can I do for you?
[ Nervous Chuckle ] They say that no one dies here.
They say your factory is a haven.
They say you are good.
Who says that?
Everyone.
My name is Regina Perlman, not Elsa Krause.
I’ve been living in Krakow on false papers since the ghetto massacre.
My parents are in Plaszow.
Their names are Chana and Jakob Perlman.
They are older people. They are killing older people now in Plaszow.
They bury them up in the forest. Look...
[ Sighs ] I don’t have any money.
I, I borrowed these clothes.
I’m begging you. Please, please bring them here.
Please, please bring them here.
I don’t do that.
You’ve been misled. I ask one thing:
whether or not a worker has certain skills.
My father is an importer, not a metalworker.
[ Continues Arguing ] Such activities are illegal. You will not entrap me!
Cry, and I will have you arrested. I swear to God!
People die. It’s a fact of life.
He wants to kill everybody? Great! What am I supposed to do about it?
Bring everybody over? Is that what you think?
Send them over to Schindler. Send them all!
His place is a haven, didn’t you know? It’s not a factory.
It’s not an enterprise of any kind.
It’s a haven for rabbis and orphans...
and people with no skills whatsoever!
[ Sighs ] You think I don’t know what you’re doing?
You’re so quiet all the time. I know, I know!
Are you losing money? That’s not the point!
What other point is– It’s dangerous! It’s dangerous to me!
You have to understand. Goeth is under enormous pressure.
You have to think of it in his situation.
He’s got this whole place to run.
He’s responsible for everything here, all these people.
He’s got a lot of things to worry about.
And he’s got the war which brings out the worst in people.
Never the good, always the bad. Always the bad.
But in normal circumstances he wouldn’t be like this. He’d be all right.
There’d just be the good aspects of him which–
[ Chuckles ] He’s a wonderful crook.
A man who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money–
Killing.
He can’t enjoy it.
Bejski told me the other day, somebody escaped...
from a work detail outside the wire.
Goeth lined up everybody from the missing man’s barracks. [ Gunshots ]
He shot the man to the left of Bejski, the man to the right of him.
He shot the man to the left of Bejski, the man to the right of him. He walked down the line shooting every other man with a pistol.
Twenty-five.
Nothing, nothing. What do you want me to do about it?
We’re just talking.
"Perlman."
[ Shouting ] Perlman!
Husband and wife.
Jakob and Chana Perlman!
Have Goldberg bring them over.
I’m sure this will be better than those rags, Lisiek.
Herr Direktor, I was just helping Lisiek to find something...
to clean the stains from the Herr Kommandant’s bathtub.
Pardon me, Herr Direktor. Go, clean it.
[ Chuckles ] You don’t have to report to me, Helen.
You know who I am? Hmm?
[ Whispering ] I’m Schindler.
Of course. I-I have heard and...
you have been here before.
Here, why don’t you keep this someplace?
Go on, take it. I get extra food here.
Well, if you don’t want to eat it, trade it. Or give it to Lisiek.
Why not build yourself up?
My first day here, he beat me...
because I threw out the bones from dinner.
He came down to the basement at midnight, and he–
he asked me where they were.
For his dogs, you understand.
I said to him, I– I don’t know how I say this.
I never could say it now– I said to him,
"Why are you beating me?"
He said, "The reason I beat you now...
is because you ask why I beat you."
I know your sufferings, Helen.
It doesn’t matter.
I have accepted them.
Accepted them?
One day he will shoot me.
No, no, no, no, he won’t shoot you.
I know. I see things.
We were on the roof on Monday, young Lisiek and I,
and we saw the Herr Kommandant come out of the front door...
and we saw the Herr Kommandant come out of the front door... and down the steps by the patio right there below us and–
and there on the steps he drew his gun and he...
shot a woman who was passing by.
A woman carrying a bundle. Through the throat.
Just– Just a woman on her way somewhere, you know.
She was no fatter or thinner... or slower or faster than anyone else,
and I couldn’t guess what had she done.
The more you see of the Herr Kommandant,
the more you see there is no set rules that you can live by.
You can’t say to yourself, "If I follow these rules, I will be safe."
He won’t shoot you because he enjoys you too much.
He enjoys you so much he won’t even let you wear the star.
He doesn’t want anyone else to know it’s a Jew he’s enjoying.
He shot the woman from the steps...
because she meant nothing to him.
She was one of a series,
neither offending or pleasing him.
But you, Helen.
It’s all right. It’s not that kind of a kiss.
[ Sobbing ] Thank you. Shh.
Here.
Right. The wine.
Wonderful party, Amon. Thank you.
Why do you drink that motor oil?
Hmm? I send you good stuff all the time.
Your liver’s going to explode like a hand grenade.
You know, I look at you– [ Sniffs ]
I watch you.
[ Sighs ] You’re never drunk.
[ Sniffs ] Oh, that’s–
that’s real control.
Control is power.
That’s power.
[ Schindler ] Is that why they fear us?
We have the fucking power to kill. That’s why they fear us.
They fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily.
A man commits a crime, he should know better.
We have him killed, and feel good about it.
Or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better.
That’s not power, though.
That’s justice. It’s different than power.
Power is when we have every justification to kill...
and we don’t.
You think that’s power?
That’s what the emperors had. A man stole something,
he’s brought in before the emperor,
he throws himself down on the ground, he begs for mercy.
He knows he’s going to die.
And the emperor... pardons him.
This worthless man. He lets him go.
I think you are drunk.
That’s power, Amon.
That... is power.
Amon the Good.
I pardon you. [ Laughs ]
[ Goeth ] What do they want?
[ Stern ] I don’t know, but they’re in my office now reviewing our books.
As my accountant, tell me, should I be alarmed...
Well– that the auditors are reviewing my books?
Or have you done your job properly? You needn’t be alarmed.
I needn’t be alarmed.

You shouldn’t do that. That’s cruel!
Come on, try and reach the far end. Look out–
[ Man Wailing ] Water! More water!
I’ve got some 200-meter hoses back in Emalia.
I have 20 meters at home in my garden.
We can reach the cars at the end. [ Laughing ]
What? What?
Yeah, sure. Hujar.
Don’t forget the roof.
On the roof on the other side.
Scharfuehrer, every time the train stops,
you open the doors, you give them water, ja?
Jawohl. Ja. This car! This car!
[ Schindler ] I’m not saying you’ll regret it, but you might.
We will have to risk regret. You should be aware of that.
All right, sure. It’s a nice day. I’ll go for a drive with you.
What about you?
I violated the Race and Resettlement Act.
Though I doubt anyone can point out the actual provision to me.
I kissed a Jewish girl.
Did your prick fall off?
[ Goeth ] He likes women.
He likes good-looking women.
He sees a beautiful woman, he doesn’t think.
[ Laughing ] I mean,
he has so many women.
he has so many women. And they love him.
Ja, they love him. I mean, he is married, ja, but he’s–
All right, no. She was Jewish. He shouldn’t have done it.
But you didn’t see this girl.
I saw this girl. This girl was, woof–
She was very good-looking.
They cast a spell on you, you know, the Jews.
When you work closely with them, like I do, you see this.
They have this power. It’s like a virus. Some of my men are infected with this virus.
They should be pitied, not punished. They should receive treatment.
This is as real as typhus. I see this all the time.
It’s a matter of money? Hmm?
You’re offering me a bribe?
A bribe? No. No, please. It’s a gratuity.
Heil Hitler!
Hello, Amon.
Sit down.
We give you Jewish girls at five marks a day, Oskar.
You should kiss us, not them.
God forbid you ever get a real taste for Jewish skirt.
There’s no future in it. They don’t have a future.
That’s not just good, old-fashioned, Jew-hating talk.
It’s policy now.
[ Man ] Ja, schoen gefangen! Gut!
[ Man ] Nochmal, ja! Schoen!
[ Soldier ] Also los! Bewegung!
Schneller hier! Zack, zack, zack!
Schneller hier! Zack, zack, zack! [ Soldier ] Beweg deinen Arsch!
Das geht auch schneller!
Bewegt euch! Schlaft nicht ein!
♪♪ [ Choir Singing Requiem ] Nur die ganzen Fetzen, nicht das Gemuese!
Was ist denn hier los? Komm, das kannst du mit den Haenden machen, fass da vorn an!
So ist es! Walhalla! Walhalla laeuft hier!
[ Goeth ] Can you believe this?
As if I don’t have enough to do, they come up with this?
I have to find every rag buried up here and burn it.
The party’s over, Oskar.
They’re closing us down, sending everybody to Auschwitz.
I don’t know. As soon as I can arrange the shipments. When?
Maybe 30, 40 days. That ought to be fun.
[ Schindler ] I’ve been talking to Goeth. I know the destination.
These are the evacuation orders.
I’m to help organize the shipments, put myself on the last train.
That’s not what I was going to say.
I made Goeth promise me he’d put in a good word for you.
Nothing bad is going to happen to you there. You’ll receive special treatment.
The directives coming in from Berlin mention "Special Treatment" more and more often.
Preferential treatment. I’d like to think that’s not what you mean.
- Do we have to invent a whole new language? - I think so.
You’re staying, I take it.
In Krakow? What on earth for? What for? You have a business to run.
Of course, you’ll have to hire new workers. Poles, I guess.
They cost a little more, but–
What are you going to do?
You ran my business.
No, I’m going home.
I’ve done what I came here for.
I’ve got more money than any man can spend in a lifetime.
Someday, this is all going to end, you know.
I was going to say we’ll have a drink then.
I think I better have it now.
[ Goeth ] I don’t understand. I mean, you want these people?
"These people"? My people. I want my people.
Who are you, Moses? Come on, what is this?
It’s good business. Where’s the money in this? Where’s the scam?
It’s good business in your opinion.
It’s good business in your opinion. You’ve got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia.
You’ve got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia.
Pay for all that and build another camp. Doesn’t make any sense.
You’re not telling me something. Look, Amon– It’s good for me.
I know them. I’m familiar with them. I don’t have to train them.
I know them. I’m familiar with them. I don’t have to train them. You’re not telling me something. It’s good for you. I’ll compensate you.
You’re not telling me something. It’s good for you. I’ll compensate you.
You’re not telling me something. It’s good for you. I’ll compensate you. That’s right. It’s good for the army.
That’s right. It’s good for the army.
What? You know what I’m going to make?
Everyone is making artillery shells. Artillery shells.
Tanks shells, ja. Tank shells, they need that.
Except me. Everybody’s happy.
You’re probably scamming me somehow.
If I’m making 100, you’ve got to be making 300.
If you admit to 300, then it’s 400 actually. But how?
You did, but you didn’t. I just told you.
Ah, ja, all right, don’t tell me.
I’ll go along with it. It’s just irritating I can’t work it out.
Look, all you have to do is tell me what it’s worth to you.
No, no, no, no. What’s a person worth to you?
What’s one worth to you?
Poldek Pfefferberg. Mila Pfefferberg.
And, uh–
Uh, Stagel, Stagel–
Paul Stagel. Paul.
[ Stern ] Doctor.
The investors. I want all of them. Yes, sir.
Uh, Fischer. Ismail Fischer.
Fischer, Ismail.
One moment, sir. I’m sorry, sir. Josef Scharf.
Come on, Stern. Scharf, Scharf.
The children. All the children.
[ Stern ] Herbert Stier. [ Schindler ] Thank you.
How many? 400, 450.
[ Typewriter Keys Clicking ] More, more.
Feigenbaum, Jakob. Wolf. Wolf Wein.
Feigenbaum: Lutek, Jakob, Nacha. Yes? Nacha.
Feigenbaum: Lutek, Jakob, Nacha. Yes? Nacha. Nacha, that’s right.
Nacha, that’s right.
[ Schindler ] And Wolf.
How many?
More. 600.
[ Schindler ] You can do the same thing I’m doing.
[ Madritsch ] I don’t know. You might even make money at it.
Come on, Julius, I know about the extra food and clothes you give them.
Paid for out of your own pocket. If we make a combined approach,
we could get more than 4,000 out, mine and yours. Oskar–
We could relocate them in something like safety, in Moravia.
I don’t know.
Too many. How many cigarettes have you smoked tonight?
For every one– [ Coughing ] you smoke, I smoke half.
I’ve done all I can. I will not accept that.
No, Oskar, I can’t do any more. I will not accept that.
No.
How many? How many? 850, give or take.
Give or take what, Stern? Count them. How many?
That’s it. You can finish that page.
What... did... Goeth... say about this?
You just told him how many people you needed and–
You’re not buying them.
You’re buying them? You’re paying him for each of these names?
If you were still working for me, I’d expect you to talk me out of it.
It’s costing me a fortune.
[ Sighing ] Finish the page and leave one space at the bottom.
You–
The list is an absolute good.
The list... is life.
All around its margins lies the gulf.
Oskar, there’s a clerical error here at the bottom of the last page.
No, there’s one more name I want to put there.
I’ll never find a maid as well trained as her at Brinnlitz. They are all country girls.
No.
No.
No. One hand of twenty-one.
No. If you win, I pay you 7,400 reichsmarks.
Hit a natural, I make it 14,800. No.
If I win, the girl goes on my list.
Why not? I can’t wager Helen in a card game.
She’s just going to Auschwitz Number Two anyway. Wouldn’t be right.
She’s not going to Auschwitz. What difference does it make?
She’s not going to Auschwitz. What difference does it make? I’d never do that to her. No, I want her to come back to Vienna with me.
I’d never do that to her. No, I want her to come back to Vienna with me.
I want her to come to work for me there.
Are you mad? I want to grow old with her.
Amon, you can’t take her to Vienna with you. No, of course I can’t.
That’s what I’d like to do.
What I can do, if I’m any sort of a man, is the next most merciful thing.
What I can do, if I’m any sort of a man, is the next most merciful thing. I shall take her into the woods and shoot her painlessly in the back of the head.
I shall take her into the woods and shoot her painlessly in the back of the head.

You’ll be pleased with the level of efficiency I get from these workers.

was the envy of every other commandant in the labor camp system.

The prisoners, however– Excuse me. They would have rather been somewhere else.
[ Schindler ] The train with the women has already left Plaszow...
and will be arriving here very shortly.
I know you’ve had a long journey.
But it’s only a short walk further to the factory...
where hot soup and bread is waiting for you.
Welcome to Brinnlitz!
[ Mila ] Beans are the best part. [ Mrs. Dresner ] Beans in chunt?
[ Danka ] I don’t like beans.
Beans and meat and potatoes and bread.
That’s not the way you make chunt.
Eggs in chunt? Yes!
[ Mrs. Dresner ] No, you don’t. [ Danka ] I don’t like chunt.
What do you like? I like caviar.

[ Man ] How old are you, mother? Sixty-eight.
Cough for me, mother. They say to fall against the fence is a kindness.
Don’t kill yourself against the fence, Clara.
If you do, you’ll never know what happened to you.
How old are you, Mother? Sixty-six, sir.
Good morning. Sir?
A mistake has been made. We are not supposed to be here.
We work for Oskar Schindler. We are Schindler Jews.
He had a factory in Krakow. Who is Oskar Schindler?
Enamelware. A pot maker.
How old are you, mother?
You are not the only industrialist who needs labor,
Herr Schindler.
I remember earlier this year, IG-Farben ordered...
a trainload of Hungarians for his chemical factory.
The train came in through the archway,
and the officer in charge of the selection went immediately to work...
and sent 2,000 of them... straightaway to Special Treatment.
It is not my task to interfere with the processes that take place down here.
Why do you think I can help you if I can’t help IG-Farben?
Allow me to express the reason.
I’m not making any judgment about you.
It’s just that I know that in the coming months...
we’re all going to need portable wealth.
I could have you arrested.
I’m protected by powerful friends. You should know that.
I do not say I am accepting them.
All I say is, I’m not comfortable with them on the table.
I have a shipment coming in tomorrow.
I’ll cut you 300 units from it.
New ones. These are fresh.
Mmm, yes, yes. The train comes, we turn it around.
I understand. It’s yours.
I want these.
You shouldn’t get stuck on names.
That’s right. It creates a lot of paperwork.

They’re skilled munitions workers! They’re essential!

How else am I to polish the inside of a .45 millimeter shell casing?

Under Department "W" provisions,
it is unlawful to kill a worker without just cause.
Under the Businesses Compensation Fund,
I am entitled to file damage claims for such deaths.
If you shoot without thinking,
you go to prison, I get paid.
That’s how it works.
So, there will be no summary executions here.
There will be no interference of any kind with production.
In hopes of ensuring that, guards will no longer be allowed on the factory floor...
without my authorization.
For your cooperation, you have my gratitude.
Come on, come.

Very generous of you. I know.

They’re withholding payment. I’ll write them a letter.

Sure, so would I, so would you. I wouldn’t worry. We’ll get it right one of these days. There’s a rumor you’ve been going around miscalibrating the machines.
They could shut us down, send us back to Auschwitz.
I’ll call around, find out where we can buy shells.
I don’t see the difference. Whether they’re made here– Pass them off as ours.
You’ll lose a lot of money. You don’t see a difference? I see a difference.
You’ll lose a lot of money. You don’t see a difference? I see a difference. Fewer shells will be made. Stern, if this factory ever produces...
Fewer shells will be made. Stern, if this factory ever produces...
a shell that can actually be fired, I’ll be very unhappy.

How are you doing, Rabbi? Rabbi!

Yes, it is.

Why? Am I broke?
Uh– Well–
[ Winston Churchill On Radio ] Yesterday morning, at 2:41 a.m.,
at General Eisenhower’s headquarters,
General Jodl... signed the Act of Unconditional Surrender...
of all German land, sea and air forces in Europe...
to the Allied Expeditionary Force,
to the Allied Expeditionary Force, and simultaneously to the Soviet High Command.
The German war is, therefore, at an end. [ Footsteps Approaching ]
But let us not forget for a moment– [ Knocking ]
I think it’s time the guards came into the factory.
Japan, with all her treachery and greed– [ Schindler ] The unconditional surrender of Germany has just been announced.
At midnight tonight, the war is over.
Tomorrow you’ll begin the process...
of looking for survivors of your families.
In most cases, you won’t find them.
After six long years of murder,
victims are being mourned throughout the world.
We’ve survived.
Many of you have come up to me and thanked me.
Thank yourselves.
Thank your fearless Stern...
and others among you who worried about you...
and faced death at every moment.
I’m a member of the Nazi party.
I’m a munitions manufacturer.
I’m a profiteer of slave labor.
I am a criminal.
At midnight you’ll be free, and I’ll be hunted.
I shall remain with you until five minutes after midnight...
after which time, and I hope you’ll forgive me,
I have to flee.
I know you have received orders from our commandant,
which he has received from his superiors, to dispose of the population of this camp.
Now would be the time to do it.
Here they are, they’re all here. This is your opportunity.
Or you could leave,
and return to your families as men...
instead of murderers.
In memory of the countless victims among your people,
I ask us to observe three minutes of silence.
[ Workers ] Amen.
[ Workers ] Amen.
Thank you, Mr. Jereth. Thank you, Mr. Jereth.
Thank you, Mr. Jereth. Thank you, Mr. Jereth.

Thank you, Mr. Jereth.
Thank you, Mr. Jereth.
As soon as peace occurs, I want...
um, I want that cloth distributed to the workers.
Two and a half meters each.
Also, each person is to get a bottle of vodka.
They won’t drink it. They know its value.
Likewise those Egipski cigarettes we organized.
[ Stern ] It’ll be done. Everything you ask.
We’ve written a letter, trying to explain things...
in case you are captured.
Every worker has signed it.
Thank you.
It is Hebrew, from the Talmud.
It says, "Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire."
I could have got more out.
I could have got more. I don’t know.

Oskar, there are 1,100 people who are alive because of you. Look at them.
If I’d made more money.
I threw away so much money.

If I had just–
There will be generations because of what you did.
I didn’t do enough.
You did so much.

Why did I keep the car? Ten people right there.

He would have given me two for it; at least one.
He would have given me one, one more.

For this.
[ Sobbing ] I could have gotten...
one more person and I didn’t.
And I-I didn’t! [ Loud Sobbing ]
You have been liberated...
by the Soviet Army!
Have you been in Poland?
I just came from Poland.
Are there any Jews left?
Where should we go?

Looks exactly like her dad. Right?
Tina is in a critical condition, Rahul.
She doesn't have too much time.
We tried our best, but her internal bleeding was
so profuse that we couldn't do anything.
She knew this would happen.
I had warned her, she'll have complications in her delivery.
But she also knew how much you wanted this child.
This child was dearer to her than her life.
I want my daughter to know me.
Who was her mother? What was she like?
She should be able to answer all these questions.
-Mom. -Yes.
I'm leaving these eight letters with you.
One each for all her birthdays.
These letters have everything that I want to tell my daughter.
These letters will remind her about me.
You are very bad.
You're very bad!
Rahul.
Hey, Rahul!
Will you be my friend?
Promise me that you will never cry.
Never.
And by the way, you look very bad when you cry.
Will you promise me one more thing?
Will you name my daughter Anjali?
Don't go!
Will you promise me one more thing?
Will you name my daughter Anjali?
When I grow up I'm going to be a VJ.
My hobbies are...
Eating chocolates
slapping boys, troubling grandma and...
reading mom's letters.
I have to get ready. I have an appointment with dad.
Anjali! Anjali, listen to me.
Wait a minute. Look.
I'm just... Oh! I'm two hours late.
But I was busy.
Dad, I'm busy as well.
You know what? I didn't watch TV today.
Because I had to meet you here
to buy clothes for you.
I can't do everything. I'm your daughter
not your wife.
Why? If I can be both, your dad and your mom, then why can't...
No.
No!
-What is it? -Did I offend you?
A little.
That's why I always say,
"One God, many forms."
No matter what form He takes, our devotion and our faith
reaches Him.
So, it's important to be connected to the Lord.
She speaks so well, right?
-So, that's all for today. -Mrs. Sharma.
-You didn't see the necklace. -To conclude...
You know what? I got this as a gift on Valentine's Day.
Roopa!
Yes?
Roopa will now recite the Gayatri mantra for us.
Excuse me?
-Come on, Roopa. -Oh!
Well, I forgot the Gayatri mantra.
-What? -What?
What are you saying, Roopa?
Did you hear that, ladies?
Roopa has forgotten the Gayatri mantra.
My dear, if you don't focus on your prayers
what will you teach your children?
Our acts and our thoughts
have an impact on our children.
-Right, ladies? -Yes.
-What is she going to teach her kids? -Grandma!
Oh, my! I just mentioned kids and here she is.
-She's my granddaughter, Anjali! -Hello!
Her granddaughter is ill-mannered!
Who taught you that?
Dad.
Go, get ready for the function at school.
-Grandma. -Yes.
Please give me the letter!
When is your birthday?
-Tomorrow! -So?
Come on, Mom. Hurry up.
-These are our seats. -Come on, be seated.
-Welcome, Mr. Khanna. -Hello.
-Have a seat. How are you? -Hello.
It's a strange competition.
The kids have to blabber on the stage.
-Yes. -It has to be an impromptu speech.
-Yes! -On the spot, sir!
No worries. He can hit me.
Every student will be given one minute!
What does she mean?
I think it's a problem.
But Jassu wins every year.
Jaswinder is the best.
Anjali is participating in the competition.
She'll stand second.
Our first contestant is Jaswinder Singh!
My daughter! Jassu, go for it!
-Come on, Jassu! Jassu! -Don't act stupid.
-Jassu! Jassu... -Go for it!
My topic is prayer.
We pray every morning.
My Dad says that if we pray
Lord will be happy with us and protect us.
But mom says, if we pray, Grandma will be pleased
and leave us a big house!
Prayer... Yes!
Also, Pooja Bhatt is my favorite actress

-Next contestant is Anjali Khanna. -Jassu! Excellent!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother.
A mother is someone, who loves us so much...
that we fail to understand it sometimes.
She is the one...
who constantly makes us realize that we are very good.
That there's no one better than us.
She is the one...
who smiles, when we are happy...
and cries, when we cry.
She's someone we cannot live without.
Mother... She means everything to us.
But you don't have a mother.
But you have a father.
And he is very nice.
Right?
This performance is number one!
You know what, Rahul? Mr. Sharma had called.
Who's that?
Our neighbor at Delhi.
-I see. -He has sent a marriage proposal.
For whom?
For me.
Then, go for it.
Shut up.
He was saying that the girl is beautiful and well brought up.
I told him that you are not interested.
Was I right?
Yes.
Was I right?
Yes.
You mean, I was right?
Yes, Mom.
Yes, I suppose.
In any case, I never do anything wrong.
I'm always right.
Who cares if she has good values
or if she's beautiful?
These days all girls are beautiful and well brought up.
Who wants to get married anyway?
Mr. Sharma is a crazy man.
He calls and harasses me. He sends marriage proposals.
Why doesn't he get married? Why is he after me--
What happened, Mom?
I don't know, Rahul.
Our family is incomplete.
Why?
There's you, there's me and then there's Anjali.
I don't think it's incomplete.
You know what?
-When I go out with my friends... -Yes.
they crib about their daughters-in-law.
-Really? -I can't do that!
That's a big problem!
It means, you want a daughter-in-law...
so that you can crib about her!
Right?
No, my son.
I just want you to be happy.
I'm happy. Very happy!
Won't you marry again?
Mom, we only live once.
We only die once.
We get married once.
And we fall in love only once.
Not again and again.
You will manage to take care of yourself.
But what about Anjali?
Why?
What happened to her?
Don't you think she needs a mother?
She is alright, Mom.
She's alright!
Because she has something that I don't have.
Her mom's letters!
My dearest, Anjali.
You have turned eight years old today.
And I'm sure you are just like your dad.
The same eyes, the same face. Right, Anjali?
No! I'm like you.
Does your dad still sleep with his slippers on?
When will he change?
So you will understand the things
that I am going to tell you today.
I'm going to tell you a story today.
This story is about me, your dad and Anjali.
Anjali?
Late again!
I can't wake up early in the morning.
Couldn't wake up or just got scared?
Hey! Rahul Khanna isn't scared of anyone.
Rahul Khanna isn't scared of anyone, eh?
But loses to Anjali Sharma in basketball every day.
Don't want to play?
What's the point? You lose every day.
Not today.
You say that every day!
Hey!
Anjali, ball...
Can't play, so now you cheat!
Hey! Don't call me a cheater!
Anjali, don't call me a cheater!
Don't call me a cheater.
No... Alright?
I'm not a cheater.
How dare you!
Don't shout like girls!
Hey! Don't call me a girl!
You are not a girl!
At least, I'm not like the stupid girls
-you chase all the time. -Oh!
Excuse me! I don't chase girls, girls chase me!
Isn't he very handsome?
A little less than you.
You have a bigger mustache.
-Was that a joke? -What if it was?
Rahul and Anjali are fighting again!
Rahul and Anjali are fighting again!
Rahul and Anjali are fighting again!
Rahul and Anjali are fighting again!
What sort of a boy is he?
What sort of a girl is she?
What do I do about him?
What do I tell her?
-He fights with me! -Yes!
-She throws attitude -Yes!
He fights with me
She gets upset
He is crazy
She is crazy
Oh my! Oh my! This boy Oh my! Oh my!
-Why does he play pranks? Ask him why? -Yes!
Oh my! Oh my! This boy Oh my! Oh my!
-Why does he play pranks? Ask him why? -Yes!
Sometimes he fights with me, Sometimes we argue
Please stay away from him
This boy is crazy
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!
This boy is crazy
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!
Oh my! Oh my! This girl Oh my! Oh my!
-Why does she play pranks? Ask her why? -Yes!
Sometimes she fights with me, Sometimes throws attitude
Tease her, but only from a distance
This girl is crazy
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!
This girl is crazy
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!
Only she understands what she says!
No one else can figure that out
She's like this and she's like that
No one can understand her
So run for your life
She is surely up to some mischief
This girl is crazy
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!
This boy is crazy
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!
He teases me, whenever he passes
He does not listen to me
Look at him! He is crazy
Beware of him
He is weird and yet
He is dear to me
This boy is crazy
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!
This girl is crazy
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!
Oh my! Oh my! This boy Oh my! Oh my!
-Why does he play pranks? Ask him why? -Yes!
Sometimes she fights with me, Sometimes throws attitude
Tease her, but only from a distance
This girl is crazy
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!
This boy is crazy
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!
What the hell!
Oh my God! What have they done to this room!
These girls will drive me crazy!
Hey, you!
What is this nest on your head?
These are rollers, Rifatbi.
"These are rollers, Rifatbi!"
These rollers are not going to get you the guys.
Let me tell you that!
How else do we woo them, Rifatbi?
Oh my God!
What kind of clothes are these? Have some shame!
-Tell us. -I don't know how to woo boys!
-Please tell us. -No!
Please tell us!
Okay.
-Boys fall for the charms of a girl. -Oh, my!
They go crazy when she walks.
-And... -And?
I don't know!
Girls talk too much!
Look at these clothes all around. This isn't a shop.
Come on, clean it up!
God! What do I do about this girl?
Anjali, what is all this?
Why are you wearing these clothes?
Darling, please behave like a girl sometimes.
Not like these crazy girls, but at least somewhat.
Come on, Rifatbi. The same advice every day!
Listen. You know what? I beat Rahul again today.
Rahul? Stay away from that fool!
Why? He is my best friend.
You never know when your best friend steals your heart.
Rahul?
-Yuck! -Yes, I know everything.
Have some dessert. Keep it a secret.
Leave me, silly girl!
No short skirts in college, please!
I'm going to complain to your mother
that you wear short skirts
and try to excite the boys.
Ms. Braganza!
Ms. Braganza!
Were you saying something, Malhotra?
I was just saying that
short skirts are not allowed in the college.
But it's in fashion, Malhotra.
This is nothing. Some girls don't wear skirts at all.
-Am I not looking good today? -Oh!
Okay?
But if you continue to expose in the college
the young boys--
Are you saying I'm not young?
You are very young.
But Malhotra you wear very boring clothes.
As long as Mrs. Malhotra was alive...
I used to wear fancy clothes for her sometimes.
But what's the point of jazzing it up now?
What do you mean by that?
-Mr. Malhotra. -Yes.
Ms. Braganza.
Mrs. Malhotra.
We? Together?
Together...
Together...
What are you doing?
Why do you scare me every time we meet? What are you doing?
This is a friendship band, sir.
I'm not only your student, but I'm also your friend.
What's the matter, sir? You look very happy today.
-What do you mean? -No, I mean... generally.
Generally, my daughter's coming home today so...
-Your daughter? -Yes.
Tina. She is coming back from London today.
-From London? -Yes.
She was studying at the Oxford University.
Actually, all of us stayed there earlier.
But when Mrs. Malhotra passed away, I was heartbroken
and I decided to come back to my country.
Why didn't Tina come back with you?
No. She wanted to complete her education.
But then... I missed her a lot.
So, I insisted
that she finished the last year of her course in our college.
After all, our college is no less than Oxford University.
Darling, won't you take care of Tina?
Rahul? Unbelievable!
Yes! You know what?
I'm the first girl he gave it to.
-You know what, Soniya? -What?
You are the only one I've given a friendship band to.
Because you are very different and you are the most beautiful girl...
-Are you serious? -Hey...
My name is Soniya.
Well...
I was so lost in your eyes that I forgot your name.
-Rahul. -Sonia...
Rahul...
You dropped them.
They aren't mine. No...
Manya...
Tanya!
Sonia.
You wasted my half an hour.
Don't you get tired
running after these stupid girls?
-Hey! I don't chase girls. -Yeah! I know!
But can't you look for that one girl who is beautiful
as well as a little sensible.
Okay. Someone who is beautiful and also quite intelligent.
Where will I find such a girl?
And anyway, I just pass my time with these girls.
Because I haven't found her yet.
-Her? -Her.
Oh, man!
I haven't found a girl who makes me feel that something.
Something?
Who makes my heart feel something.
What?
Something happens.
You won't understand!
When she walks, she makes heads turn.
When she stops, time stops with her.
And when she laughs...
"Her..." What will you do when you meet her?
What will I do?
Yes!
I will kneel in front of her and say,
"Hey! Whoever you are..."
Tina!
Tina.
How do you know her?
This morning, the principal--
Don't talk about the old hag.
Is it your first day at college?
Yes, she came back from London.
How do you know that?
Because this morning, the principal--
I said, don't talk about that bald nut.
Bald nut?
Where did you study in London?
-How do you know? -Because the principal--
Let the baldy be.
We have this really nasty principal.
-And she is his stooge. -Nasty?
Nasty, right.
How do you feel on your first day of college?
Go to your classes!
Short skirt.
He is the nasty principal.
You're not allowed to wear short skirts in college.
You know, I am just back from London
and I haven't unpacked.
Actually, it's Tina's first day at college.
She came from London yesterday and had no time to unpack.
So, she wore whatever she could find.
Oh! How do you know?
Sir, I know Tina since childhood!
Since childhood?
-Dad? -Dad.
Dad.
-Dad... -Mr. Malhotra.
Not there, sir. She's waiting for you in the staff room.
-Staff room? -Yes.
He is an old hag, he's bald and he's nasty.
-And... -He is smart.
-No. -He is sweet.
He is a grouch, but he's not a bad person.
We just met, friendship is a far thought.
So? Something happened?
-No. She's not my type. -Why?
She's not Indian enough.
She's born and brought up in England.
Moreover, these London-returned girls are a little weird.
I need a girl
who I can take home to my mother.
You won't find anyone.
-Why? I have you. -Me?
-Yuck! -Why not?
If I don't find any girl, I'll marry you.
Anyway, no one will marry you.
Anjali.
Take this.
-What's this? -This is the college sweatshirt.
Isn't it cool?
Anjali.
Can I ask you something?
Why is everyone staring at me?
You very well know why the boys are staring at you.
And the girls want to know why the boys are staring at you!
So, they are staring at you.
If you face any problems
just come to me or to Rahul, you know.
Rahul? The one, who...
And we sort of rule this college.
He is Rahul.
We have a rule in this college.
We make every newcomer sing. You know, "Do, Re, Me..."
Rahul, she's the principal's daughter.
So what? We can't break our rules for anyone.
-But Rahul-- -Shut up, principal's darling.
Tina Malhotra!
Tina, you have to sing a song for us
-and for this college in Hindi. -Hindi?
Why? Have you forgotten Hindi since you settled in London?
One minute.
Rahul, how can she sing a Hindi song?
Why? She's the principal's daughter.
If he can't teach her, how will he teach us?
You must sing a song in Hindi.
And make it fast because
we don't have much time.
Oh, Lord of the universe
Mighty Lord of the whole universe
Oh, Lord of the universe
Mighty Lord of the whole universe
The agonies of devotees
The sorrows of devotees
You eliminate it no time
Oh, Lord of the universe
Oh, Lord of the universe
Oh, Lord of the universe
In spite of staying in London, or being brought up there
I haven't forgotten my values.
And you better not forget that.
Hey! You've taken my seat.
Ms. Braganza!
Today, we are going to start a new lesson.
An eternal love story.
But before we start, I want to ask you something.
What do you know about love?
What is love?
Tina? What is love?
I don't know.
Tell us, what is love?
Love? I...
Rahul.
What is love?
Love? Love is friendship.
If she can't be my best friend, I can't be in love with her.
Because without friendship, there is no love.
Love is friendship.
Love is friendship.
Love is friendship.
Want to be friends?
Something happens
Something happens
Oh, my head! My feet! Upside down!
Oh, my!
I hope I didn't disturb you.
And if I did, I'm sure you wouldn't mind.
So, tell me, Ms. Braganza.
I called to tell you that the rehearsals are complete.
Our college will be the best in tomorrow's competition.
Students from other colleges would be dumbstruck.
All thanks to you, Ms. Braganza.
And it's all for you, Malhotra.
Ms. Braganza!
I have fallen.
Our college, St. Xavier's!
What! Oh my God!
They can't make it?
Ms. Braganza, there is a curfew in their neighborhood.
They can't leave.
Good God, what do we do now?
You have to do this, or else, you both are going to fail.
-Mr. Malhotra. -But sir, how can we sing and dance?
We don't know anything.
You know these students, they will skin us alive.
Nothing will happen to you.
The students, who were going to perform today
have recorded a tape of their rehearsals.
I'll play that tape and there would be a beautiful song.
You just have to move your lips.
Like in the films.
It won't work.
What do you mean? Of course, it will work.
Mr. Malhotra.
My name is Chin Chin Chu!
Moonlit sky, you and me Hello, mister, how do you do?
So?
What?
What? What do you mean?
Anjali, you...
Don't you care about your college's reputation?
That's very tragic, dear.
Come on, Rahul. It's about our college's reputation.
-Come on, Malhotra! -Ms. Braganza...
-Come with us, Tina. -No, I'm not coming.
-What are you saying? -Hey, Anjali!
Why are you asking her?
-That's a huge crowd. -Yes.
This must be it.
You are a foreigner
You are a foreigner
You won't be here for long
You are a foreigner
You won't be here for long
Ms. Braganza, it's a mistake.
I've played the wrong tape.
You won't be here for long
You are a foreigner
-You won't be here for long -No! No!
I found someone
I found someone
I found someone
What has happened to me?
Why do I feel so lost?
Either I was insane earlier
Or, I've become mad right now
Dreamy eyes and unkempt hair
What have you done to yourself?
-I found someone -I found someone
-I've lost my heart -I've lost my heart

-I've found someone -Found someone
I wonder, what has happened to me
People have started calling me crazy
And why is that so? We should be aware
What has happened to you?
I was alright until yesterday
My heart was filled with happiness
Why are you restless now? Why are you disturbed?
Have you lost someone?
-I found someone -I found someone
-I've lost my heart -I've lost my heart
-What do I say, friends? -What do I say, friends?
-It has shaken me -It has shaken me

Who is this disguised as a cloud?
Who's the one ruling your heart?
I would like to answer you
But I can't tell you her name
Don't tell us her name, But say something
Give us a clue
She's in my eyes, she's in my breath
What else can I tell you?
-I found someone -I found someone
-I've lost my heart -I've lost my heart
-What do I say, friends? -What do I say, friends?

Anjali, what's wrong?
I wonder why I am missing my mother today.
Hey! How can you say that when I am here?
Silly! Crying isn't going to help you in anyway.
It never helps.
Seven minutes!
Anjali.
How long have you known Rahul?
From the first day at college.
You know what I did? I defeated him in arm wrestling.
Ever since we've been best friends.
Rahul is your best friend, right?
No. I am Rahul's best friend.
Aren't you in love with him?
-Shall I go? -Where?
Today is Tuesday.
Yes! Rahul goes to meet his relatives every Tuesday.
-Yes. -But I'll stay back, if you say so.
-No, Rahul. You'll be late. -I have some time.
Go, Rahul. You will be late.
God, please see to it that I don't fail in my exams this time as well.
I am a bit weak in Chemistry. So, you take care of it.
What are you laughing at?
It's better I sneak out.
-Rahul! Rahul! -Yes?
So, your relatives stay here?
Yes, here. Not there, here... Here. Somewhere around...
Okay. So, Rahul Khanna comes to the temple every Tuesday.
Why did you lie at college then?
Actually, boys don't go to the temple. So...
-But you do. -Yes.
You come every week?
Don't call me sweet.
Actually, my dad used to say that...
Don't tell this to anyone at college.
-About this? -Not this.
He says that a man bows before three women.
Before his mother, before Goddess Durga
-And... -And?
And?
How do I wear this?
Wear it!
Cool! You will look cool.
I was just trying it.
I wonder how they wear it.
There's nothing wrong in doing girlish things once in a while.
Here your mother's letter.
You were missing her, right?
-Yes. -And, listen.
-Take this as well. -What is this?
Tina!
Rahul?
Rahul, what are you doing here?
Actually, I couldn't sleep
and I thought that you won't be asleep.
If you're awake, you'd be thinking about me, so I came here.
Do you like flowers or chocolates?
I was just asking.
By the way, I have chocolates as well.
Don't you think it's too hot out here?
Okay! If you insist.
Sit down, feel at home.
Isn't this the novel where the butler murders the couple?
Yes.
Why waste time reading such a huge book? Ask me!
Yes, it's the same one.
-I've read it. -Rahul.
-You didn't conclude your story. -Nothing like that.
-This couple goes on a holiday. -Okay.
They hire a butler.
Later, the butler is...
-Not this story. -Then, what else?
The one you were telling me at the temple.
Which temple? I don't know any temples.
The story about a man bowing to three women.
-His mother, Goddess Durga... -Really?
-And? -And?
-And? -And?
-Rahul. -Tina.
-Rahul. -Tina!
-Dad? -Grouch.
What's happening?
Rahul, dad's coming here.
You must leave.
No, not from there.
-Rahul, go from there. -My ladder...
-Go! -I didn't end the story.
-Three women... -Speak later. Not now.
-Before his mother, Goddess Durga and... -Dad!
And, Tina...
Rahul.
And...
I'll climb the ladder and catch him.
What is it?
Throw it.
Damn...
Hey! Who hit me?
I'll become a ghost.
If a ghost comes, it'll get scared of me.
Where is the ladder?
Ladder!
Ladder!
Oh, my!
Malhotra!
Why are you sneaking into your own house?
What are you giggling about?
Rahul, what are you doing?
-I was coming to meet you. -Me? why?
Because... Hey, look! A shooting star!
-Where? -Not on the ground, up there!
They say, if you see a shooting star and make a wish
your wish will be fulfilled.
-You believe that? -Let's try it. Come on.
You came close to me
Smiled ever so sweetly
You came close to me
Smiled ever so sweetly
You showed me dreams
You came close to me
Smiled ever so sweetly
You showed me dreams
These days my heart is Neither awake nor asleep
What should I do? Something happens
What should I do? Something happens
You came close to me
Smiled ever so sweetly
You gave me dreams
These days my heart is Neither awake nor asleep
What should I do? Something happens
What should I do? Something happens
Oh! What kind of a feeling is this!
What is this unquenchable thirst?
The intoxication of love
Is consuming me
No one knows, why one is restless!
What should I do? Something happens
What should I do? Something happens
My prayers have been answered
God knows when I fell in love
I wonder how I found peace
In turmoil!
I sit alone weaving memories
What should I do? Something happens
What should I do? Something happens
You came close to me
Smiled ever so sweetly
You showed me dreams
You came close to me
Smiled ever so sweetly
You showed me dreams
These days my heart is Neither awake nor asleep
What should I do? Something happens
What should I do? Something happens
Rahul?
The butler's the killer! Ouch!
Hey! Oh my God! Look at that.
-What? -Look at that.
Oh, God! What is she wearing?
What an outfit!
-How do I look? -What?
It doesn't suit her.
She looks weird.
Just like Tina, right?
I knew she was crazy!
Pink and orange! Superb!
It looks very happening!
I'm crazy, right?
I wanted to look beautiful like you.
But I don't know anything...
You're beautiful, Anjali. Very beautiful.
You're lying.
Didn't you see them laughing at me?
-They... -They are idiots like me.
Actually, you're very beautiful
because you're very different.
At least you're not like those stupid girls I keep chasing.
You know what? You can date any boy you want.
-Anyone? -Anyone.
-Anyone? -Anyone.
But he has to be cockeyed.
Okay, tell me. Where did you find this lipstick from?
Do you know Babli from our class? She gave it to me.
I'm going to thrash her.
And who gave you the dress?
Love is crazy, it is amusing
It's oblivious to happiness and pain
Dad.
Rahul.
Dad?
You can't keep secrets from me.
But Rahul? Couldn't you find anyone else?
Actually, I would have felt bad
if it were someone else.
Why?
Because I'll have to share your love with him.
That is the problem.
Have you confessed your love to him?
I just feel that Rahul and Anjali...
Tina, I just know that Rahul only loves you.
And Anjali is his best friend. That's it!
No, Dad.
Somewhere within the deep friendship, lies love.
And I don't want to come in the way of
the friendship that can turn into love someday.
The whole college knows
that Rahul and Anjali are best friends and nothing else.
Go, tell him that you love him.
But I don't know if he loves me.
Don't keep matters of the heart a secret.
Go and profess your love to him.
Yes!
I never thought, I'd say this to someone.
I hope, I have the courage to tell her this.
You know, I decided to confess it to her many times
but every time I go to her and decide to tell her this
I feel I can say it to her... But in her presence
-I... -Tell who?
Tina! Who else?
Let's do this again. I'm Rahul and you're Tina, okay?
I...
Won't she say that?
Shall I tell her?
-Yes. -Shall I go right now?
Okay.
Oh, my Lord
May love
Never hurt anyone
May the things in my heart
Always be a secret
I will never
Speak about it
May that never happen
My first love was left incomplete, Rifatbi.
My first love was left incomplete.
You didn't think of me, There's nothing more left to say
You didn't think of me, There's nothing more left to say
My heart cried, My eyes were filled with tears
My heart cried, My eyes were filled with tears
There's nothing more left to say
You didn't think of me, There's nothing more left to say
You didn't think of me, There's nothing more left to say
My heart cried, My eyes were filled with tears
There's nothing more left to say
You didn't think of me, There's nothing more left to say
You didn't think of me, There's nothing more left to say
Mom!
I gave you all my joys
I gave you all my smiles
Your locks entice me, They bring the message of love
You couldn't care for my love
There is nothing more left to say
You didn't think of me, There's nothing more left to say
You didn't think of me, There's nothing more left to say
Anjali. Anjali!
-Rahul, you look ahead. -Anjali... Yes.
-I'll go check there. -Yes, go.
Anjali...
Hurry up!
Excuse me.
Where are you going?
-Home. -What?
I got a letter from my mother. My dad's not keeping well.
And there is lots of work in the new house.
Have you gone mad?
You got a letter and you're leaving!
-You're not going anywhere. -Rahul, I have to go.
How can you go in the middle of the term? Come on.
You can leave after the final exams.
You can go after the final exams.
Anjali, after the final exams.
Rahul, I might not come back for the final exams.
I'm not coming back, Rahul.
You are leaving college, leaving me.
But you didn't tell me about it.
Rahul...
-Rahul, I'm going. -Go!
Rahul, I'm not coming back.
Anjali!
Hey!
Anjali!
Please don't go.
Who will play basketball with me?
You lose every day.
But why are you going?
-My mom needs me, Rahul. -Don't I need you?
Not anymore.
Now you must irritate Tina. You've troubled me enough.
-I'll fail. -Who cares?
Hey, Anjali!
Stop chasing those stupid girls.
-Hey! -Hey!
Hey! But I'll miss you, dear.
That day I realized
perhaps, I had come between Rahul and Anjali.
Perhaps, I had come between two friends.
Anjali's silence told me everything.
And that day, I realized that she loved your dad very much.
I couldn't love him as much.
Anjali neither called, nor wrote to us.
She had gone away from our lives forever.
You dad would say, "Love is friendship."
Yes, I did become his friend
but I couldn't be his best friend.
Dear, I know your dad very well.
Your father is lonely, but he won't tell that to anyone.
He needs a friend, he needs love.
That friend is Anjali. That love is Anjali.
Bring Anjali back into your dad's life.
Help Anjali find her first love.
Anjali and Rahul are made for each other.
This is the truth and this is my dream.
Will you fulfill your mother's dream?
Bring Anjali back into Rahul's life.
Bring Anjali back into your father's life.
Please fulfill my dream, dear.
Please fulfill my dream, dear.

Yes, Malhotra speaking.
Making a long-distance call on my personal phone.
Okay. Aren't you all coming here tomorrow?
Yes, absolutely!
As soon we reach Delhi, we'll board the train to Faridabad.
-I see! You mean the train at 4:00? -Yes, that one.
Hey, what are you doing?
Well...
I'm coloring my hair... I mean, nothing.
No, sorry. I wasn't talking to you.
What do I say about the servants in Mumbai!
I see! So...
I'll come and receive you at the station.
Are you sure you will come? The last time, you had forgotten.
May be the last time. But I'll come this time.
What about the materials for the death anniversary?
Yes. I'll bring all the materials with me.
Okay then, bye.
Bye.
We're going to do something new on today's show.
-Would you like to play a game? -Yes!
They say, this game helps you
voice out the things in your heart.
I'll say a word. You say the first word
that comes to your mind, after hearing that word.
But!
You won't be given any time to think.
Cloud.
-Cloud. -Rains.
Neelam.
Heart.
Seema.
Did you see how they expressed their feelings?
Now you can try this game.
-Dad, don't call Neelam stupid, okay? -Come.
Okay, I won't call Neelam stupid.
Come on, now quickly tell me about your game.
Grandma!
-Shut up, naughty boy! -Dad, be serious.
Okay, I'll play seriously. Tell me.
Cloud.
-Dad, you can't take so long. -I was drinking water.
Alright. Now I won't take time and start the game. Ask me.
-Cloud. -Breeze.
-Crazy. -You.
-Home. -Us.
-Love. -Friendship.
-Anjali! -Sharma!
Sharma?
Who is Anjali Sharma?
Who is she?
No one.
Anjali Sharma was my classmate in college. Okay?
In college?
Yes. She was my friend.
Friend?
She was my best friend.
She has a very nice name, Dad. How was she?
Anjali.
-She wasn't like the other girls. -Okay.
She was...
just like us boys.
You know what? All the girls used to put on makeup.
And Anjali...
Anjali used to play basketball.
And she used to wear manly clothes. Yeah, trust me.
Anjali was a silly girl.
Dressing up, applying makeup, trying to look beautiful...
She didn't know anything.
Is that enough, or do you have any more questions?
Dad, where is she?
I don't know.
Oh, my! I still don't believe you're getting engaged, Anjali.
Listen, the priest is downstairs to decide your wedding date.
Show me that one.
How long will you take to dress up? Come on, Aman is impatient.
Ask him to wait. This bride will take long.
Your beloved has been waiting
Don't delay anymore, come at once
Your beloved has been waiting
Don't delay anymore, come at once

This is the old address. Where will I find the new address?
Grandpa! Can't you do this for me?
-I can do this for you-- -Really, it's very bad!
Can't you do this much being the principal?
But why drag the principal into this?
Wait a minute.
She will definitely know where Anjali Sharma is.
Allah is the greatest!
Forgive me, but I promised Anjali
that I won't tell her address to anyone.
We came here with great expectations.
Mr. Malhotra, I understand. But I can't break my promise--
Rifatbi.
My name is Anjali. Won't you tell me?
She is getting engaged today.
And she will get married this week.
Anjali's mother believes in a god-man.
He'll be coming today to decide the wedding date.
You're late.
Mr. Malhotra, I was planning
-to leave tomorrow afternoon by train. -No!
-This wedding can't take place. -They're making arrangements.
It's my mom's wish. This can't take place.
-Sir, I wanted to fix the wedding date. -Yes, dear.
-This is Aman's horoscope. -Okay.
Actually, Aman has to go back to London.
If you could fix a date for this month...
-This month? -Yes, sir.
Mr. Malhotra, had you come a little earlier--
Yes, but we didn't...
Allah is the greatest!
Allah is the greatest!
There is no God...
But Allah
Dear, I wonder why Anjali is in a very bad phase.
Unless it gets better, she can't get married.
There is no God, but Allah
Then how about next month?
The wedding can't take place next month either.
Prophet Mohammed is His messenger
Anjali cannot get married before December.
I did hear of God's miracles, but today I've witnessed it.
The girl's prayers have been answered.
Anjali can't get married before December.
-Anjali. -Yes?
-Shall I ask you something? -Yes.
Are you happy?
What sort of question is that, Mom? Of course, I'm happy.
I'm engaged.
Aman is a very good man.
He loves me very much.
-And then he-- -But do you love him?
Anjali?
I've already been in love, Mom.
I've already been in love.
Perhaps, I won't be able to love again.
Think of this as a compromise.
Compromise?
My daughter will compromise, but not fall in love...
I had never imagined that.
I'm a mother.
Don't I want you to be happy and settle in life?
But a home that is built on compromises and not on love...
is not a home. It's called a house.
The rest is up to you.
I can't do this.
I can.
The priest will sing hymns and also read the holy book.
Really amazing! The priest...
Why? Because he delayed my wedding.
Look, God will get irritated with so many hymns.
Why? Don't you want to ask something from God?
What should I ask for? I have found you.
Now, I think, we should have a couple of children.
And I'm afraid that God can't help with that.
I'll have to do things--
-Hey, Aman! -Oh, no!
Aman!
I saw you at the courtyard in the morning.
-You were working out, shirtless. -Really?
Kammo! Stop eyeing at the young lad, you old woman.
-Shut up! -What are they saying?
You must be old!
Oh, move aside. Don't pester the poor boy.
He is such a handsome boy. Don't you have a brother?
-What is she saying? -Gurpreet is good-looking.
What are you saying?
Oh, forget Gurpreet!
My Jaspreet is Miss Chandigarh.
-Miss Chandigarh or Miss Sector 11? -Excuse me.
Ladies!
The priest is about to start the reading. Hurry up.
-Goodbye. -Bye, Aman! We're leaving.
Come on!
Anjali, there's a call for you.
Aman.
-I have a small problem. -What?
Please don't leave me like this.
Aman, I wonder who's on the phone.
Anyway, you're going to Shimla for a month, for a summer camp.
You are going to Bombay.
Yes, for 24 hours and you are going away for a month.
Aman, you know I go to the summer camp
every year to teach the kids singing and dancing.
Now those kids are a part of my life.
Okay! Now they are a part of your life.
But I'm left out.
Why do I feel that you don't love me?
Because I don't.
And you don't want to marry me?
Right, I don't want to marry you.
Hey!
If you create a problem this time...
I'll drag you to the altar.
-Will you force me? -I have no choice.
Do you have the courage to do that?
Try me.
-Hey, Aman! -I'll stay with your aunts.
You can go to Shimla, for your summer camp.
Shimla?
What? Summer camp in Shimla?
You're not going to any summer camp.
Dear, it snows heavily there.
Whatever! You're not going there.
-Is this fine? -Yes.
I heard they teach singing and dancing.
And you know I'm fond of singing and dancing.
Since when did you start liking singing and dancing?
No means, no! That's final! That's it!
Let her go, Rahul.
-Mother, don't start again. -Why aren't you sending her?
Children go--
But...
But Rahul, try to understand. Why can't she go? I'll accompany her.
-Dad, I want to go. I want to go. -Yes, why not?
-I want to go... -There will be other children.
She will enjoy it.
Shut up! I said no. So, no one will go!
There's no need to argue!
No one will go to the summer camp. None of you!
-Did I offend you? -Yes.
But this doesn't mean that you're going to the summer camp.
Now no one should talk about the summer camp.
I'm going for the conference. We'll talk after I'm back.
-Dad. -What is it?
Please, wear your pants.
I don't want to wear them.
You can wear them, if you like.
What is it?
Driver, get the pants, I mean, the car.
Anjali, this is all right. We'll go to the summer camp.
But your dad won't come there, right?
Come on, Grandma! Do you remember, when I was 4...
-Yes. -and dad was in London...
-and I had a bad cold. -Yes, my child.
-Grandma, Dad had rushed back home. -So?
Shut up!
Anjali.
-Hello, please let me speak to Dad. -Dad?
Is your dad a film star?
-Say his name. -Yes, sorry.
Anjali.
Anjali?
Say we're going to the summer camp
and hang up immediately.
Rahul Khanna.
Speak to him.
Hello, Aman, I can't hear you.
I can hear everything, tell me, I'll reply.
-What? -I miss you very much.
Okay, listen. I'm going to the summer camp tomorrow morning.
Where are you going?
Summer camp, again?
I said you are not going to the summer camp! It's a no!
Okay, listen, I'm feeling very...
Give me a kiss.
This is your mother speaking!
Listen, I don't like such jokes.
My mother died ten years ago.
Oh, God! Why is everyone hell bent on killing me?
Aman, why are you yelling?
Hey, I'm yelling, because I thought we were through this.
Now, listen. If you ever talk about the summer camp
I'll come home and slap you.
Aman, you have gone crazy! Oh, God!
Anjali?
Your Dad has gone crazy.
Anjali?
Anjali?
-Anjali? -Yeah, Anjali.
I think the names are same, so she just got confused.
My Anjali is more beautiful than your Anjali.
-No. My Anjali is very beautiful. -Maybe.
But she can't be more beautiful than my Anjali.
My Anjali is my eight-year-old daughter.
Then your Anjali is definitely more beautiful than mine.
Dear, Dad. Sorry. We left without informing you.
You know, I'm so fond of singing and dancing.
-Don't miss me too much. Okay? -No.
I can't do that!
Anjali!
I'm Colonel Almeida, the manager of this camp.
I will check your height and weight. Okay?
Eat some fruits. Eat good food.
Who is this child?
Hey!
I'm grandma.
Anjali's grandma.
I'm the manager of this camp.
No mummy, daddy, or grandma allowed here in this camp.
So, you think I'd send Anjali here alone?
What?
Have you seen Miss Anjali? Miss Anjali?
What?
A British flag in my country?
Let me check with him.
Almeida!
Almeida!
Aren't you ashamed?
You've hoisted a British flag?
My father was a tailor during the British rule.
He cut this flag, you know.
The British went away, but left Almeida behind.
Shameless man! You should teach the children that
"India is great!"
Who's that?
Hey, what's your name?
Hey!
-What's your name? -Anjali.
Hey, that's my name. Hi!
Why is your name Anjali?
Maybe because my parents liked this name. That's why.
Why is your name Anjali?
Maybe my parents liked you. That's why.
Where's Mr. Almeida?
Hello.
Almeida!
Almeida!
Stop following me!
Okay. Tell me where's the kitchen?
I want to see how they cook.
And where is the temple here?
Pooja isn't on duty.
Oh! Pooja means worship. It means veneration.
Oh, ma'am, we don't do all this here.
What? Don't they offer prayers here in the morning?
Aarti?
Almeida!
Are you counting the stars?
Are you counting the stars?
He just doesn't speak.
Please keep my dad happy and see to it
that he doesn't miss me too much.
You know he can't do anything without me.
You prayed for your father. Nothing for your mother?
-Why should I pray for Mom? -Why?
She's with Him after all.
She can ask Him whatever she wants.
Hey!
Now go to sleep quickly, okay?
Neelam!
Neelam!
Neelam! Neelam! Neelam!
Neelam! Neelam! Neelam!
Neelam! Neelam! Neelam!
Neelam! Neelam!
Like always we'll do something new and different.
The theme of today's show is love messages.
-Okay. Who is the message for? -Suparna.
-Who is Suparna? -My girlfriend.
What's the message?
Suparna, don't call me. I've found someone else.
Okay, one more message.
I want to give a message.
The camera is behind you.
The way he gave a message...
-And his message is... -Anjali.
Anjali, where have you gone?
You know, I've been so lonely without you.
Please come back or...
Just come back.
Please come back.
Who's Anjali?
Anjali is my eight-year-old daughter.
You know, she has gone to some stupid summer camp at Shimla.
Hey, Neelam, you tell her. She'll definitely listen to you.
-Please ask her to come back. -Sure.
Come back home.
Hi, Rahul. There's a party at my place tomorrow.
Don't forget to come.
Dad...
Cold?

Anjali!
My love, I impatiently
My love, I impatiently
Waited for you all the time
The heart helplessly cries in solitude
-Sari? -Yes.
Something happens
What do I do? Something happens
-Anjali. -Yes?
I hope you are keeping well.
Yes, why?
Because you look beautiful.
The sari.
I didn't know about Tina.
How would you know?
You just disappeared.
I shifted to a new house.
You changed friends as well, right?
You weren't around, when I needed a friend.
Didn't you get married again?
I didn't find you, or I would have married you.
Rahul.
Anjali.
We live and die once.
We get married once...
-and love... -We fall in love just once.
You didn't get married.
-I didn't find you. -Right.
Hey! That... A shooting star.
You still believe in it?
No. You?
No.
-Anjali. -Yes?
What did you wish for?
Grandma.
-What's the news? -It's bad news.
They are behaving as if they have met for the first time.
-What do we do now? -What do we do?
-What do we do? -What do we do?
-What is it? -You have a plan, grandma?
My child, only prayer is the solution.
Oh, come on, grandma!
-There is only one way. -What do I do?
You are the only one, who can guide us!
I won't spare you.
-What are you doing? -Have you gone crazy?
Is this what I have taught to you?
-She's a girl. -Why are you fighting?
She hit me first.
I just said that girls can play basketball.
-But he said... -Boo! Girls can't play basketball.
He told you the fact and you started fighting with him?
Why? Didn't Ms. Anjali beat you in basketball every day?
-Hey, quiet! -Hey!
Quiet!
She wouldn't defeat me every day
but sometimes.
Rahul, you would lose every day.
Anjali, try to recollect. You would lose every day.
Rahul, you lost every day.
Don't lie in front of the kids.
-You're being a bad influence. -What!
-Am I lying? -Is it me then, liar?
The truth is you can win, only if you cheat.
Anjali, don't say that.
-No! Don't pull my hair! -I'll kill you. Cheater!
I challenge you right now. Play with me.
Why? Are you scared, Rahul?
-Rahul Khanna isn't scared of anyone. -Yes.
-Rahul! Rahul! Rahul! Go with her! -Rahul!
-Rahul! -Rahul! Rahul!
Rahul!
Basketball match with boys? I'm sure Rahul will win.
Rahul! Rahul!
Rahul! Rahul!
Rahul! Rahul!
Rahul! Rahul!
Rahul, you'll lose again.
No. I've been practicing for the last eight years.
I won't lose.
-Listen. -Yes.
Take care of your sari.

Hey! Don't cheat, if you don't know how to play.
Hey! Don't call me a cheater.
Girls cannot play basketball.
I said it before...
This woman's a mystery
Is she a dream, reality or a fiction?
Look at her, she's so silly!
She hasn't changed at all
She's just as crazy as she used to be
This man's a mystery
Is he a dream, reality or a fiction?
Yes, this crazy fellow
He hasn't changed at all
He's just as crazy as he used to be
We were close, but still There was a distance
I wonder, why were we so helpless!
It was such a strange phase
The time, when you were close to me
Why do you look lost?
Look at me, I'm right here
I felt lonely when I was in a crowd
I missed you all the time
Somebody please hold me
I may be overwhelmed
I have no control on myself
Please take care of me
This woman's a mystery
Is she a dream, reality or a fiction?
Yes, the crazy fellow
He hasn't changed at all
He's just as crazy as he used to be
You showed me dreams
It's neither awake nor asleep
Something happens
Something happens

Okay, Nikhil. This is your letter.
And Mamta, this is your letter. Okay?
Okay. Kids, now listen.
Your mothers are complaining that none of you are replying.
And I've complained to your mother
-that you don't speak. -What's happening?
-Okay. Today... -What to do...
You will write a letter to your mothers in my presence.
Pass it down. Anjali, you write to your mom--
Had you been with us...
you would have proudly said...
that Anjali's your daughter.
Because she's a very nice girl.
And why not?
After all her name is Anjali.
But you know what's the best thing about her?
She's just like you.
Same eyes. Same face.
I don't find this family incomplete now.
It doesn't look incomplete.
Oh! You're taking photographs without me?
Okay, I am here.
I hope I am looking good. My sari?
-Very nice. -Should I sit here?
Yes, sit. Please, take your seat.
No, no! A little up.
-Up? Okay. -Yes.
Just a minute. No, not there.
A little more up.
Where are you sending me?
He'll send me to the top.
-A little more. Yes. -Okay.
-Should I sit here? -Yeah! Okay.
How do I look?
What happened, Mr. Almeida?
Something's wrong.
Is it fine now?
It's perfectly fine. Take their picture.
Just the two of you now.
But... -Please. It's enough now and-- -Anjali, come on.
-Please. It's enough now and-- -Anjali, come on.
Rahul, Anjali!
Rahul, Anjali!
How can someone look so beautiful?
Anjali does look very pretty in this picture, doesn't she?
-Really? I didn't look at her yet. -Yeah, right.
Don't pretend. I know it all.
She's not around
so you find pleasure in watching her pictures.
What do I do, mother-in-law?
Aman, the wedding is in December.
-Why don't you go to London meanwhile? -No.
-I won't go anywhere. -Why?
-I don't trust your daughter. -Aman.
I had a hard time convincing her for marriage.
Till the time the circles... What are they called?
-Holy rounds. -Yes! Until that is not done
I'm not going anywhere.
Crazy.
-You love her a lot, don't you? -No.
Yes.
-But I feel... -Yes.
that she doesn't love me.
She doesn't, right?
Mother-in-law?
She doesn't, right?
Aman, you've gone crazy.
She didn't reply.
We are to play a new game today.
It's called Dumb Charades.
There will be two teams in this game.
-That's team A. -Yay!
-And that's team B. -Yes.
Okay! Enough!
In this game, a player of one team will whisper a movie name
to the player of the other team.
That particular player, without talking
has to act and explain to his team
the name of the movie.
Remember, you can't speak.
Come on.
-Boo! -How can I do it?
-Boo! -Boo!
Come on.
Look, kids...
You can't speak.

Mom, Madhuri! Hum Aapke Hain Kaun!
-Yay! -Yes, grandma!
-There's no such movie. -There is, Dad.
Anjali, there's no such movie.
-There is. -But I haven't seen any such movie.
-Okay, best of luck. -Hold on.
Hey. There is. There's a movie with this name.
I've seen the movie! What's the name of the movie?
It is!
We're in trouble! He's thinking.
Rahul can't do it.
I know it has three words. What next?
Rahul, what are you doing?
Rahul, I don't understand anything.
What are you doing?
Look at him.
-What's it? -He's a statue.
-What? -Rahul.
How do we do it?
Do it again.
Couldn't you enact that?
I couldn't.
Had you done it, we would have won.
Oh God!
Come on kids, to the barn. Come on, go to the barn.
Come on, Manish. Run! Run! Run!
Come on, Mamta, Nikhil.
Just a minute.
Are you out of your mind?
-Anjali. -Yes?
I'm feeling very cold.
-Oh, God. -Hey!
-Yes? -Come with me.
-I'll take you to some place. -But...
-Almeida, you can't fix a leakage. Go up! -Anjali!
-Anjali! -Go higher. Higher.
Mom. Did Anjali come here?
-She's sitting right here. -Not her, the other one.
-You help us. Climb up. -Did she come here?
-Anjali! -Rahul.
Rahul, I...
Anjali, I wanted to talk to you.
Actually, I wanted to talk to you there, but you left...
Is this cowshed your summer camp?
What are you doing here? Hey.
-Is she your Anjali? -Yes.
She's my Anjali.
And she's my Anjali.
I'm not that good.
I've lost.
-You've lost? -Yes.
I don't believe this, pal. Not possible.
-Who won? -Anjali.
-Your Anjali? -No.
-Your Anjali. -My Anjali?
-Basketball? -Yes.
Tell me something.
You were with her in college, right?
How was she? Who were her friends?
She was the soul of the college.
Everyone used to come to her with their problems.
What changed? Nothing at all.
-Look. I've come to her with my problem. -Yes.
What's your problem?
My only problem is that I love her very much.
What kind of a friend are you?
You didn't attend your friend's engagement.
You're engaged?
We got engaged, but with great difficulty.
And we are getting married in December, I think.
Listen, tell your friend
if she doesn't marry me in December then...
-I'll marry the basketball. -Marry the basketball, eh?
We live once.
We die once.
We get married once...
and fall in love once.
Anjali.
Men are very weak, dear.
They are very weak.
They do have principles.
But they forget that no principle can hold back a heart.
We make these stubborn, weak men realize...
that relationships are matters of the heart
and not principles.
Dear, these relations become reality
only if we express the things in our heart.
Anjali, you should express the feelings in your heart.
Doing so can break a heart at times.
It won't be happy, if you don't express your feelings.
It won't be happy.
Anjali, you didn't tell me about this.
Aman told me that you're getting married.
You're happy, right?
You're happy, aren't you?
Are you happy knowing about that?
Yes, I am.
Then how can I be happy?
I don't get it.
Rahul, something happens.
You won't understand.
Anjali, something happens.
You won't understand.
-Sir. -Yes?
-Can I ask you something? -Go ahead, kid.
Why are you marrying Ms. Anjali?
What? Why?
-Anything wrong? -Yes, there is.
You're so handsome.
What happened?
Ms. Anjali doesn't look pretty.
She's dark, fat and short.
Yes. You have any idea?
You can get any girl.
-I can get any girl? -Yes.
Would you marry me then?
You'll have to find a good girl for me.
-I already have. -Who's she?
That one.
-The one from MTV? -Yes.
What will happen to Anjali?
-You have to find someone for her. -I have.
-You have? -Should I tell you?
-No. -Let me reveal.
-No. -Please let me.
No. No. No.
-Please, please, no-- -Aman.
I want to go back tonight.
You're going?
Please don't go.
Please don't go.
Anjali.
You had given this to Tina...
when she was about to start a new life.
You will be starting a new life.
I know...
that you and Rahul will be very happy together.
Aman.
It's Aman.
Aman.
Oh my love
Oh my love
You didn't think of me, There's nothing more left to say
You didn't think of me, There's nothing more left to say
My heart cried, my eyes filled with tears
My heart cried, my eyes filled with tears
There's nothing more left to say
You didn't think of me, There's nothing more left to say
Please start the wedding preparations.
I don't wish to wait any longer.
Anjali, the priest says
there's no date available before December.
Mom, not the date, but our fate decides our good and bad times.
No one can change that.
-Aman's here. -And he's riding a pony.
Bindiya, the priest has come. Please attend to him and--
Hello.
You're Rahul, right?
Yes.
Anjali and I...
-I know. -Is Anjali getting married?
Yes. Anjali decided to get married all of a sudden.
I didn't get the time to prepare.
-Sister-in-law, please come here. -Coming.
Please come, be seated.
I'll be right back.
Anjali?
It's said that if you make a wish before the shooting star,
it is always fulfilled.
Anjali!
Anjali!
Anjali!
My love I'm restless
My love I'm restless
I've been waiting for you for so long
But then you never said
The things you said just now
The heart helplessly cried in solitude
What do I do, when something happens
What do I do, when something happens
Time's running out. Please call the bride.
Anjali.
The time is running out. Please call the bride.
Anjali, come.
Didn't I say I'll grab you by your hand and take you along?
Aman.
You know, I always wanted to see the love in your eyes
that I have in my eyes.
I've seen that love today...
but it's not for me.
You're crazy, Anjali.
You've only loved him.
Ever since you've known what love is
you've only loved him.
Rahul is your first love.
Ask me what first love means.
And you...
You were about to sacrifice all this for me?
You're crazy.
How can I come in between both of you?
This love was never meant for me.
Anyway, someone told me...
that I'm handsome enough to get any girl I desire.
-Aman, I... -What do you want to say?
Go.
Go.
Rahul.
The bridegroom wears a flower veil
The bride's hands are covered with henna
Listen to what The dot on her forehead says
Her beloved has come home
Her beloved has come home
Why does the bride shy away?
Her beloved has come home
Her beloved has come home
Her beloved has come home
They're crap. They fall apart before you're out the door.
Five then, sir. It's handmade!
Please? My sister. She's very, very sick.
I know your sister. She's peddling in the next bar over.
Do you know my mother?
Nope. She's very, very sick.
I'll give you two.
That's a bad idea, you know.
Like feeding pigeons.
Do I know you? My name is Semelier.
I work for a private collector of rare antiquities. I cabled you last week.
Yes.
And I didn't answer.
There's been a discovery in East Africa.
A Christian church, circa 5 A.D.
No, that's not possible.
The Byzantine Empire had adopted Christianity at that time,
but they never got that far south. Nevertheless, there it sits.
The British have financed a dig to uncover this church.
We believe a rare object waits inside.
We'd like you to find it and bring it back to us.
So you think I'm a thief?
Now you think I'm a thief and a whore.
No...
simply a man who's lost faith in everything except himself.
You know nothing about me.
An Oxford-educated archeologist, an expert in religious icons.
You were a priest before the war. So, what happened?
This is a leather impression of the artifact we're looking for.
A representation of a mythical demon.
It's Sumerian.
What makes you think it's in a church in Africa?
Major Granville in Nairobi is in charge of the dig.
He's been persuaded to let you join it.
You're assuming that I will say yes.
You already have.
MAN: March!
Left, left, right, left. Left....
Left, left, right, left. Left.... Left. Left, right, left. Left...
Mr. Merrin, sir. The major will see you now.
GRANVILLE: Beautiful, aren't they?
It's a hobby from school days. Works wonders for the nerves.
You should try it sometime.
What can you tell me about the dig?
The location is a remote area of the Turkana district called Derati.
It was discovered several months ago
by a detachment of my men on maneuvers there.
When the powers that be realized its importance, they organized a dig.
So, what have they learned so far?
That it's a church where no church should be.
This is Father Francis.
He'll be accompanying you to Derati.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Father Merrin.
I've read all your work at seminary. It's Mr. Merrin.
I was especially impressed with your treatise on the Roman rituals.
I'm no longer a part of that.
But I'm sure you didn't come here to discuss Catholic rituals.
No, I was actually headed to Kenya to begin missionary work when Rome learned of the discovery.
They asked me to make sure the site's religious aspect have the proper consideration.
How come you've opened the site to the Vatican?
We haven't...
officially.
You're both my guests.
Tell me, have you any theories on who might have built this church?
Well, not until I've seen it.
Surely the Vatican has some record of its creation?
No, I'm afraid not.
We're as in the dark about it as you are.
How long have you been with the dig, Chuma?
Since the beginning. The British hired me as an interpreter.
What happened here?
Plague. Ravaged the valley 50 years ago.
How many died?
All of them.
I'm Lankester Merrin.
Major Granville should've contacted you about my joining the dig.
He did.
Is something bothering you, mate?
No. I'd like to see the dig site as soon as possible.
Do you drink, Merrin? I shouldn't.
But my will is weak.
Then you might just survive this place.
I understand you've uncovered the church dome, but that progress has slowed down.
You could say that. Right, doctor?
I'm Sarah Novak. Very nice to meet you. Lankester-- Lankester Merrin.
You still haven't made it by my room, doctor.
I've been having this swelling...
in the evening. Thought you might have something I could put on it.
How about a muzzle?
So how are the interior excavations coming on?
They're not. No?
Has the structure collapsed?
No, the church is perfect, but none of the men will enter.
Those we have left, anyway. Why is that?
I shall be leaving for the dig in five minutes.
Pleasant fellow.
What's wrong with his face? Other than that it's attached to his body?
Could be an allergic reaction or some kind of localized infection.
Do you know why the men won't enter the church?
Evil spirits... Oh.
if you believe the Turkana.
And do you?
No. I'm a doctor.
As a priest, surely you must believe in such things.
I'm an archeologist. I'm not a priest.
Now, that's funny. I met Father Francis outside, and he told me you were.
Did he? Well, he is mistaken.
FRANCIS: Father Merrin.
This is Emekwi.
He's donating the use of a room in his hotel for the mission school.
Father, we are so glad that you are here.
These are my sons, James and Joseph.
Hello, James. Joseph. They are learning the Bible.
We are Christians, you know.
Emekwi, can you see to Mr. Merrin's bags?
Of course. James, Joseph?
Very nice meeting you, doctor.
There's your goddamn church.
MERRIN: Is this your first assignment, Father?
FRANCIS: Uh well, before this, I was studying in the archives in the Holy See.
The Vatican. Impressive. But not really training for missionary work, is it?
This is strange.
It's 1500 years old.
It should be badly weathered.
It's almost as if it were buried right after it was built.
Chuma.
Where's Jefferies? I need to go into the church.
Hyenas.
They've been here ever since we started digging.
Even at daytime?
What's the matter with him? I don't know.
The heat?
Joseph?
Are you out here by yourself? It's dangerous.
I'm collecting rocks. I can see that.
I think you're about ready for this now.
It's a tool for professional diggers.
His seizure stopped. I wanted to keep him at the hospital for observation,
but Turkana have stopped trusting my medicine.
Well, that must make your job very hard.
You have no idea.
Thank you.
What is it you hope to find here?
The answer to why a church was built here
a thousand years before Christianity arrived.
You were a priest once, weren't you?
Yes, I was.
Bloody savages!
Can't wipe their own ass without instruction.
I have to get back to town. Wait. I found this.
And I want you to have it.
It's a St. Joseph, for luck.
Please. For my behavior.
Thank you.
What the hell are you doing?
Get the fuck out of here, you little scab! Don't!
Joseph, wait. Don't do that.
All right, Merrin. I didn't know you was a fuzzy lover.
SARAH: It's okay. Come.
These little buggers get in everywhere.
How soon can you have the doors to the church uncovered? A few days.
A few days. And in the meantime, how do we get in?
"We" don't. Chuma will take you in through the roof.
Following us, Father?
Is it safe to walk around?
Let's see.
Lucifer. The Lord's favorite angel.
MERRIN: Cast out after the war in heaven.
Can't even trust angels, can you?
You ever seen anything like it? Not this far from Rome.
It's odd.
Churches were built to exalt heaven, but this...
The weapons are pointing downward.
Look behind you, Father.
Desecration of Christ.
Who would do something like this?
The crucifix was broken off from here.
Chuma, is there an inventory of what's been found here?
I wouldn't know. MERRIN: Who would know?
Because this place has been vandalized.
Probably the lead archeologist, Monsieur Bession.
So where can I find him?
I need to talk to him.
It's not possible. Why not?
He's gone mad.
No one's been inside Bession's tent since he fell ill?
They are superstitious.
And you? Not superstitious. Smart.
Chuma!
Yes?
Where's Bession now? A sanatorium in Nairobi.
How long has he been gone?
A few weeks.
And he can read and write Aramaic? Sorry?
The language spoken in Palestine
at the time of Christ. And what does it say?
"The fallen shall rise in a river of blood."
Do you have a moment? Of course.
Can I get you some tea?
Or maybe something more substantial?
Yes, that would be very nice.
You dabble in the occult?
I found them here when I arrived.
I wanted to ask you, did you treat Bession?
You should let me clean that before it gets infected.
There was nothing I could do for Monsieur Bession.
He had no medical symptoms.
Nothing to suggest any kind of disease or infection.
His breakdown was purely mental. And extremely severe.
That's why the Turkana fear the church is cursed.
That and the disappearances.
In the past few weeks, we've lost a dozen men.
Runaways?
Or is it those evil spirits? Yeah.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have... Your curiosity's perfectly natural.
My father was a strong man.
When the Nazis started rounding up the Jews in our town, he didn't hesitate.
He hid our neighbors in the crawl space.
But someone turned us in, and we were all sent to the concentration camps.
I'm sorry.
People can't really understand, can they?
If they weren't there.
If they didn't see.
No.
My husband turned out to be one of those people.
I met him after the war, and we came to Africa together, in love.
One night I realized I-- I had to tell him the truth...
...about the Nazis and what they did to me.
After that, he never touched me again.
So...
What turns a man of the cloth into an archeologist?
I don't know, I suppose I--
I wanted to work with something real, something I could touch with my hands.
Do you miss it? Being a priest?
No. There's no point in that.
Sometimes I think the best view of God is from hell.
I should get to bed.
I'm going to Nairobi tomorrow, to see Bession.
Talk to Father Gionetti. Gionetti?
He runs the sanitarium.
Well, thank you... for the medical care.
[WHISPERING] And deliver us from evil.
for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever....
Amen.
You, priest, what is your name?
I'm Father Merrin.
God is not here today, priest.
Want some water?
Hey. What's wrong?
It's late. You should go back to bed.
Give it to me! It's mine!
Oh, is it yours? Give it to me!
Mr. Merrin gave it to me.
Here, take it. Take it! Oh, just give it to me, you idiot!
Who are you calling idiot? Take it, it's right here!
Give it to me! It's mine! Shorty, shorty!
Just give it to me! All right, okay!
Go back to bed, and I'll give you the stupid thing.
Joseph, look out!
Joseph, get Papa, get Papa!
Joseph, help me!
Joseph, please, get Papa quickly!
JAMES: Help me! Help me!
JAMES: Help me! Papa, help me, please!
SARAH: What happened? Hyenas. They tore James apart.
Did you see that, Lankester? The hyenas ignored Joseph.
They were focused on his brother. That was a lot more than focused.
They acted as if he wasn't even there.
Can you see? Can you hear?
Monsieur Bession?
Mr. Bession.
You worked on a dig in Derati.
You drew a picture of an idol.
Where did you see it? Was it in the church?
MERRIN: Monsieur Bession.
Father Merrin. How do you know my name?
I said, how do you know my name?
Are you hurt?
No.
I'm free.
God is not here today, priest.
I hope he finds peace.
I'm Father Gionetti.
I've been waiting for you.
MERRIN: How did he know my name?
Have you drifted so far from God, Merrin, that you can't see?
Monsieur Bession was touched by the devil.
Demonic possession? Forgive me, Father.
I never said he was possessed. Only touched.
So, touched. What does that mean?
In 1647, the Ursuline Convent in Loudun, France
was plagued by possession.
Thirty-four nuns had been touched by the devil, committing unspeakable acts.
Having orgies including goats doesn't make them possessed, simply horny...
and inventive.
Four priests were dispatched to exorcise the demons.
Three of them were possessed themselves and subsequently died.
The last one was driven insane by his brush...
with evil.
That is what happened to Monsieur Bession.
And that evil remains in Derati.
You must be careful there.
Remember, he is the father of lies.
He will seek to poison your mind.
You will need this against him.
The Roman Rituals.
If you need somebody to perform an exorcism, I'm not your man.
I'm not a priest anymore.
You will always be a priest, Father Merrin.
Only your faith can save you.
Well, then, I'm doomed.
Joseph?
What do you have there?
Can I see?
You threw it away.
Jefferies, what the hell are you doing in here?
It was in the dirt outside, you threw it away.
No, I didn't.
The clasp must have come loose. Liar!
Do I repulse you that much?
Maybe if you could cure my fucking face,
I might look as good to you as that archeologist.
Joseph?
[WHISPERS] He's coming for you.
What?
[NORMAL VOICE] He's coming for you.
What happened? I had a bad dream.
Don't worry.
You'll be fine.
Where is everybody?
Sebituana's baby is coming, so the village has gathered in welcome. Oh. [DOOR SLAMS]
Joseph.
Hey.
Joseph.
You're back.
Are you all right? Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired.
These lesions...
they're not from the shock, are they? No. They're completely asymptomatic.
No. They're completely asymptomatic.
It just doesn't make sense.
He should have recovered by now. So, what is it?
In this part of the world...
it could be a dozen things.
But his symptoms don't really match any of them.
So all I can do is just watch and wait.
I have to do some work up at the dig.
Will you be all right? Yes.
Come sit with me, Lankester.
I promise I won't bite.
What is it?
How was Nairobi? Oh, fine.
Did you see Monsieur Bession? He's dead.
How? I don't know.
Some accident.
I just don't understand.
Everything that's happening here...
It seems like I can't help anyone anymore.
Hey.
Easy.
Help me hold him.
Emekwi.
I'm doing everything I can for him.
Joseph?
It's this place, Lankester. The Turkana are right, it's cursed.
Sarah. You don't understand.
What they did to me in the camp. They--
There's nothing left to bleed.
There is something here, something evil.
Sarah, it's so much easier to believe in evil as an entity, but it's not.
in evil as an entity, but it's not.
It's a purely human condition inside all of us.
Did Bession talk about what he found under the church?
There's an ancient temple below, a pagan place,
where they used to conduct sacrifices, human sacrifices.
Why would they build a church on top of something like that?
Perhaps to purify the site.
But then, why bury it?
Merrin!
You better come with me.
Jefferies didn't show up for the dig this morning.
He wasn't in his room, so they came to the bar, and they found...
Chief Sebituana's baby was stillborn last night.
He blames the whites.
You think the Turkana took Jefferies?
I think this place is on the verge of an uprising.
I've contacted Major Granville. A detachment will be here by this afternoon.
You disagree?
In my experience, bringing soldiers into a situation is always a bad idea.
MERRIN: Who buried them?
Everybody died.
Who buried them?
MAN: All right.
Out!
Major Granville. Hello, Peter.
MAN: Come on. Out you get. Move it, Wilkins.
Any answers on Jefferies? I'm afraid not.
Well, you did the right thing calling me, Father.
I've been in these situations before, and you have to stay on top of--
On top of these people.
I'm not sure the Turkana are responsible for what's happening here, Major.
Major Granville?
This dig is too important to jeopardize, and until I'm satisfied that the excavation is secure,
and until I'm satisfied that the excavation is secure, the British army will assume complete control.
The Turkana won't like the show of force. I'm not concerned with what the Turkana like, Mr. Merrin.
And if they start any more trouble,
they will have to answer to the might of His Majesty King George.
You cannot be here.
Please tell Sebituana I'm sorry for his loss.
You are not welcome here.
I want to know about the plague that destroyed this village 50 years ago.
It was not a plague.
So, what was it?
The evil in your church, it has taken Emekwi's youngest son...
and it is getting stronger.
You must abandon your work... or we'll be forced to stop you.
So you don't want to tell me?
He says he doesn't have to tell you, because it's happening again...
right now.
You don't bury your dead. You cremate them.
Yes. Then who's buried in that graveyard?
I'm sorry.
What are you--?
I'm sorry.
Daddy.
I will shoot 10, priest...
and you will choose.
I can't do that.
No!
Now you choose...
or I will kill them all.
Are you praying?
To God?
Shoot me.
God is not here today, priest.
[CRYING] Papa.
They're empty. What?
I dug up three graves. They were all empty. What happened here?
I don't know. Oh, yes, you do.
You've been lying to me since we got here. Let go of me. Damn it!
Let go of me. Damn it! There are crosses on the graves.
There are crosses on the coffins.
The church buried them, didn't they?
Didn't they?
Yes.
Why?
What were they hiding?
That this place is damned. [SCOFFS]
No! You asked the question! Now you're gonna listen to the answer!
There was a massacre here...
1500 years ago.
An army from the West, led by two priests,
searching for the origin of a powerful evil.
But when they got here, that evil consumed them,
turning the soldiers against each other in a bloodbath.
Only a single priest survived. When that priest made it back to the Emperor Justinian,
he ordered that a church be built over the site and then buried to seal the evil inside.
All mention of it was to be stricken from the history texts forever.
But it wasn't.
No.
In 1893,
a Vatican researcher found an ancient letter in the archives.
Four priests came to examine the site,
enlisting the help of the people of this valley in their search,
and they all disappeared.
Where did they go?
No one knows.
The Vatican ordered a cover-up...
the false graveyard.
The tale of a plague to....
To scare people away.
And then the British stumbled across it.
And I was sent here to see if the legend was real.
What legend?
That after the war in heaven...
this is the spot where Lucifer fell.
God brought you here, Lankester.
Leave me alone.
No.
No.
The devil is here...
inside that boy.
The Turkana know it.
They came to drive the devil from him, and he almost killed them.
You can't run from this.
You must help me.
I can't.
But you've seen what's going on here.
You have to believe.
I believe in nothing.
They've found Jefferies.
Major Granville. Wait.
Get him down.
Get him down!
You all right, Major?
Savages.
Major.
Major!
Bloody savages. JOMO: Why are you here?
Granville! JOMO: You have no business to be here!
JOMO: You must leave. Granville!
JOMO: You people have plundered our ancestors.
You must return Turkana to us now. MERRIN: Let me through!
JOMO: It's time to go. You have already polluted our lives.
You came here with your evil.
We knew peace before you came. MERRIN: Granville!
No!
CHUMA: They think it's inside Joseph. They believe the evil is upon us.
Chuma!
Merrin?
They believe it is inside Joseph. They're going to kill him.
Now, please...
go.
Sir, the Turkana are preparing to attack.
Leave me.
Sir?
I said, leave me.
Yes, sir.
We must leave now. Why?
Where's Sarah? I don't know.
Take the boy to Nairobi.
Father Gionetti.
FRANCIS: Why?
Turkana are coming to kill him.
It's a sandstorm.
It won't let us leave.
We have to hide him.
The church. No.
The Turkana won't go in there. It's his only chance.
Aren't you coming? I have to find Sarah.
We'll meet you.
Francis.
Now go.
Sarah?
[WHISPERS] The Lord is coming for you.
Sarah?
Sarah?
Sarah? [KNOCKING]
Sarah!
Oh, my God.
Bession was Sarah's husband?
Yes.
She went into the church with him, didn't she?
It's not Joseph.
It's Sarah.
Ready yourselves, men!
MAN: Fire!
Chuma.
Francis?
Francis?
Francis.
O, Lord, forgive my disbelief.
I need you.
These people need you. This valley needs you.
Hear my cry.
Do not abandon me now.
Forgive my sins.
Joseph.
[DEMONIC VOICE] Come sit with us, Lankester.
I promise I won't bite.
Joseph, run.
He's mine.
Run.
Leave him alone.
It's me you want.
I am a fallen priest.
Lord, have mercy on us.
Christ, have mercy on us. Lord, have mercy on us.
God, Father in heaven, have mercy on us.
God, the Son, redeemer of the world, have mercy on us.
God, the Holy Spirit, have mercy on us.
Christ, hear us.
Holy Mary, pray for us.
Christ, hear us.
Lord, have mercy on us.
What's the matter, Merrin?
Don't you wanna fuck me anymore?
All ye holy angels and archangels, pray for us!
All ye holy orders of blessed spirits, [LAUGHS] pray for us!
Why would he listen to you?
You.
You believe in nothing.
You're all alone.
Without hope.
Almighty Lord and father of Jesus Christ...
grant me, your unworthy servant, pardon for my sins...
and the power to fight this cruel--
Joseph, come on.
Don't be afraid. No! Father!
MERRIN: Joseph. JOSEPH: Father Merrin....
Help me.
Joseph!
Oh, Lord...
by your name, save me.
By your strength, defend my cause.
Joseph.
Joseph.
Joseph, wait.
Joseph. JOSEPH [ECHOING]: Father.
I'm coming.
O, God, hear my prayer.
The ruthless seek my life. They do not keep God before them.
Turn back the evil upon my foes.
In your faithfulness, destroy them.
Where is your God now, Merrin?
Fucking his only son while you call out his name?
He doesn't care about this whore. But you do...
because you want to shove your rotten cock up her juicy ass.
You can't have her, priest. The whore is mine.
And I'll kill her before I let you take her from me.
For the soul's made to the image and likeness of God...
I cast you out!
You're a killer, Merrin.
You looked them in the eye, pointed, and they died.
[GERMAN OFFICER'S VOICE] God is not here today, priest.
Oh, yes, he is.
You're going to watch him die, Merrin Fail him like you failed all the others.
God, spare this child, for he is innocent...
and deserves your blessing. God, spare this child...
for he is innocent and deserves your blessing.
God, spare this child, for he is innocent and deserves your blessing.
I command you to depart! It's the power of Christ that compels you!
It is God himself who commands you. It is the majestic Christ who commands you.
God, the Father, commands you. God, the Son, commands you.
God, the Holy Spirit commands you. The mystery of the cross commands you.
Unclean spirit, I cast you out!
[NORMAL VOICE] Lankester.
Sarah, Sarah.
It's over now.
Joseph, Joseph.
Father.
Don't be afraid. I need your help, Joseph.
Listen, whatever you hear, whatever you see, it's just his lies.
Don't listen. Don't watch. You understand?
Don't listen!
It's just lies. You have to be strong and concentrate.
Can you read this?
I will start there. Then you will answer.
That's me. That's you. That's me, and that's you. You understand?
Good.
Let's start.
O, God, by your name, save me.
"Amen."
Save your servant.
JOSEPH: "Who places his trust in thee, my God."
Be unto her, O, Lord, a fortified tower.
JOSEPH: "In the face of the enemy."
O, Lord, hear my prayer.
"And let my cry come unto thee."
The Lord be with you. "And also with you."
Be gone, evil spirit...
In the name of the Father and of the Son...
and of the Holy Ghost.
By the sign of this Holy Cross...
by our Lord Jesus Christ...
God, the Holy Ghost, commands you!
The blood of the martyrs commands you!
In God's name, demon!
I cast you out!
Sarah.
Sarah.
Okay?
[NORMAL VOICE] Thank you.
Sarah. What is it?
What is it, Sarah?
Help. Help!
Lankester. No.
Help.
No. Help.
Sarah.
[WHISPERS] Father.
She's with God now.
She's with God.
I trust your mission was successful.
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
But you found something.
Didn't you?
Goodbye, Mr. Semelier.
Have you ever heard of a comfort gay?
This is the story of my life.
One bad dream.
A nightmare.
But every bit real.
Good gracious!
Joan Crawford wannabe!
If only cold water can freeze the passing of time.
Remove the morning star…
Ugh! Sewage!
Call for them, sis.
Call them now!
Oh my gosh!
Hey, you gay fossils! Breakfast is ready!
This is where I live.
Never heard of it?
There's still a lot that you don't know.
It was founded by a councilman from Pasay.
Oops! Councilwoman, I mean.
Why haven't you called them yet?
But I already did! Maybe those witches aren't hungry yet.
That can't be.
They may have soft hearts but they have appetites of steel.
Call them now!
Hey, old hags! Time for breakfast!
You idiot!
Don't ruin our morning!
Call those queens again! And this time, with respect!
Fine.
Hey, fabulous gays!
My dear, you can insult them all you want,
but never ever call them…
…ancient, prehistoric, or old.
It's profanity, I tell you!
Here's your itinerary for today, sis.
Be sure to pray that the council approves our home's budget.
I'll have to do that later. I have work today.
I can help you, sis.
I'm also free today.
Stay out of this.
Let him do the praying. After all, God listens to sinners.
-Ouch! -Just kidding.
Hang on, don't eat yet. We have to say grace first.
Just like we always do every morning, remember?
Please tell him we're not sleeping.
We're just closing our eyes.
Point your toes forward, step, step…
Add a little sway on your hips…
Don't be in a rush.
Walk in a zigzag motion. Like this!
And then pause, place one hand on your hip and the other over here.
Bend your knee like this, okay?
Imagine yourself as a teapot.
Got it?
What's so funny?
Show me your walk. Let's see if you can make it to japan.
My dear.
Why do you walk like this?
My goodness, you look like a frog!
You know where they'll send you?
To Gapan, not Japan!
One more time!
BASILICA OF THE NAZARENE
Visiting churches
has been a part of my daily routine.
I live a simple life.
Sometimes, I teach beauty lessons
to Japan-bound entertainers.
But oftentimes, I spend my time in church…
along with old maids and those in despair.
Sounds lame and boring, right?
Hey!
-Good evening, Councilor! -Candy! Come here!
What is it?
Who are those kids?
-They're my nephews. -What nephews?!
You and Dading should learn how to act your age!
The cops might pay us a visit soon! Do you know what you're doing?
That's corruption of minors!
Have you forgotten that I'm a councilor? Show some respect for my sake!
-So what do I do? -Get rid of them!
-I already paid him in advance! -But you don't have any money!
-It was only a deposit, you idiot! -Ouch!
They are neither soldiers of the Philippine Army…
…nor guerilla forces from Hukbalahap.
But they are also victims of war.
And they now have come forward…
…to reveal the injustices that they've suffered
at the hands of the Japanese invaders.
They are known as "comfort women."
Women who were sexually exploited by the Japanese during World War II.
After decades of silence, Nana Rosa finally had the courage to come forward.
If we could only bring back the past,
I'm sure they'll understand the justice that we seek.
They'll probably do the same.
My life since then has lost its meaning.
-What now? I already paid him! -Kick them out!
Markova!
-Hey! What's with her? -Beats me! Find out for yourself!
Are there boys inside?
Who is it?
It's me, sis.
Come in.
Sis?
What's bothering you?
Nothing.
Are you sure?
Is it about that TV show you were watching?
Sis…
I'm always here to listen to your problems.
Okay, thank you.
Don't be sad.
Those wrinkles of yours are starting to look like rice fields.
Pretty soon we'll be able to plant sugarcane in there too!
You don't want to get ugly, do you?
You'll grow old too, you witch.
You know, being sad is unhealthy.
Okay, I'm off to bed.
Long live the Emperor!
Thank you very much.
Sis?
Why are we meeting here and what's with all the drama?
I wanted to meet here…
…so that God can hear us.
I'm sure He can hear us wherever we are.
Yes, but I feel free whenever I'm here.
All right, fine. What's this about?
I want to come out.
Come out?
What do you mean?
I want to come out…
…and share my story.
My God! What for?
I'm sure I'm not the only one who knows your story.
You make it sound like everyone in Manila knows my secret.
So you do want them to know?
Sis…
Just let it go. Forget about the past.
Are you sure about this?
If Nana Rosa had the courage, why can't I?
But you're different!
Nana Rosa and I are alike.
Oh my God.
You said I could always count on your help.
Of course!
So I'm telling you now.
Please, sister of mercy…
…help me out.
My God, I feel like doing a novena.
Do you have a rosary?
Let's walk on our knees.
-Where's your rosary? -It's there.
But this is a Chinese rosary!
Councilor JJ almost had me impressed.
Can you imagine?
He was able to invite Loren Legarda!
You're Loren Legarda, aren't you?!
Does Mrs. Markova live here?
Mrs. Markova?
There's no Mrs. Markova in here.
Hey, you gay!
Let her in!
You're looking for Walterina?
Yes! Ma'am Walterina.
I see. Right this way.
I have an appointment with Mrs. Markova.
Um--
Ma'am Walterina?
-So Councilor JJ told you? -Yes, he told me Mrs. Markova lives here.
I'm Markova, but I'm no missus.
Excuse me, is JJ around?
He's in a council meeting today.
But he did mention that you were coming.
Wait a second.
So Mrs. Markova does not live here?
I'm afraid so.
So there's no comfort woman?
None.
So what's the story here?
-Just tell JJ-- -Please don't be angry.
Please tell JJ I'm going to kill him.
I'll relay your message.
Sometimes, I also feel like doing it myself.
Speaking of the devil, JJ!
My report on comfort women is serious.
You told me you knew a comfort woman!
Fine, what else can I do? I'm here so I might as well.
All right.
Pardon me, Miss… Mister…
Walter Dempster, Jr. is my real name.
Let's take a seat.
Markova will do.
Markova?
That's my screen name.
As far as I know, only criminals use aliases.
Ouch.
It's okay.
Let's start from the beginning.
Don't you have a camera?
No need. I just have to hear your story first.
Where do we start?
My parents lived in the province of Iloilo…
…but we grew up in Manila.
My father was a doctor. He had an optical company.
My mother was a simple housewife.
How many siblings do you have?
There were four of us.
Two boys and two girls.
Oops, pardon me.
I meant three girls and one boy.
-And where do you fit in that order? -I'm the third.
My sister, Francesca, was the eldest. Then my brother, Robert…
then came the beauty queen, which is obviously me,
and our youngest, my sister Arabella.
When did you know that you were gay?
I was a late bloomer.
Probably in my teenage years.
How old?
Probably around my sweet sixteen or seventeen.
It was so difficult to hide it from my family!
I can't help but show my true colors.
I first came out to my mother.
It was okay with her.
And when I came out to my father, he just ignored it.
He didn't care.
On the other hand, my two sisters were both delighted!
But my brother Robert…
He was the villain in my life.
He was always angry at me.
He couldn't accept my true beauty!
He was beating me up three times a day!
It was a closed-door massacre!
I became his punching bag!
Why don't you play basketball?
Yeah, so you'll have the chance to play with your boyfriend!
Boyfriend? Who?
Come on, stop acting clueless!
Who are you talking about?
Who else but him!
Look! He took his shirt off!
Now I really want to play basketball!
You like Antonio?
I'm sure Guia won't like that.
Then may the best girl win.
Here she comes.
Hey, Walter!
Why don't you play with them?
Antonio's waiting for you.
I think I prefer the swing.
Really?
-Then have fun with this! -Hey, stop it!
Hey, I might fall!
That's what you deserve.
-Stop it! -You like it?
Ouch!
My tummy hurts!
-You can handle it. -Stop it!
Hey!
-Stop it, Guia! -Don't worry!
Walter!
Stop it!
I have to go.
My prison guard is here.
What did I tell you?
Hang on!
Take it easy! You might ruin the car.
What did I tell you?
I don't think I remember.
So now you're talking back?
Well, you asked me a question.
Smart.
I thought you were just gay.
I didn't know you're a smart-ass too!
Remember this, okay?
Start acting like a man.
Understood?
A sassy gay brother? That's a tough one.
My brother's warning did not scare me.
Whenever I'm alone in my room,
that's when the flirt in me comes out!
I really can't contain the woman in me.
I would even get Arabella's clothes and try them on!
Walter?
Hang on!
Walter, open up!
Just a second!
What are you doing in there?
Coming!
One time, I was caught red-handed.
My brother always gets home late. But one night,
this monster comes out of nowhere!
Yes, brother?
-Are you deaf? -I was sleeping.
-What do you need? -I just forgot something.
What's this?
That's nothing.
When will you ever learn?
Brother, please!
You're a disgrace!
Mom! Robert's hurting Walter!
What? Where?
Please! Don't!
I won't stop until you end
this foolishness!
What can I do? This is the real me!
You know what you can do?
You are a man so start acting like one, you idiot!
What's happening here?
Stop it, Bobby! Are you trying to kill your brother?
Mom, I might kill him already if he doesn't start acting straight!
That's enough, Bobby.
Damn it!
Are you okay, Walter?
Why is he like that, Mom?
I'm not doing anything wrong.
I just want to be who I really am.
Is that a sin?
Does he always beat you up whenever he sees you like that?
Precisely.
And if he knew about this other truth,
he might've really killed me.
Hey.
Give this to Roco.
What's this?
Stop asking questions. Just bring it to him.
Hmm!
Monster!
Anybody home?
Oh, it's open.
Hello?
What is it?
My brother told me to give this to you.
Leave it on the table.
You want a drink?
Um--
You want to open that liquor you brought?
No, thanks. I don't drink.
Hang on.
Wait, do you want butter or cheese?
What?
What do you want on your bread? Butter or cheese?
Any will do.
Soda?
Here's your sandwich.
Have a seat.
Not there, over here.
Do you often drink with my brother?
Yes. Why do you ask?
He really shouldn't be drinking.
Is that why he gave me that package?
-I guess. -You're wrong.
That's just our sideline.
What does that mean?
We sell alcohol in the black market.
What is a black market?
You ask too many questions.
What do you do anyway?
I'm a movie actor.
Really?
You don't believe me?
Come with me. I'll show you my photos in my room.
I need to go because…
-My brother might be looking for me. -Don't worry about him!
He just asked me to bring you that package.
And?
Nothing more.
In that case, come with me.
I'll show you those photos.
Please! Don't!
Have pity on me!
Ouch!
What are you doing?
Please! Don't!
Help me!
Stop! Have pity on me!
Don't!
Shut up!
Where are you, my love?
Why don't you sit properly, Walter?
Mom, I have a boil on my bottom.
A boil?
It's a skin infection.
-It's a swelling filled with-- -I know what a boil is.
That's enough. We're eating.
You just need to bathe more often.
I don't think that would help.
That's enough!
I can't describe how I felt back then.
I just knew I was mad at my brother.
With regards to the incident,
I guess…
I liked and hated it at the same time.
But it was big, sis!
Did I shock you?
I forgot how serious you are whenever I see you on TV.
You mean you're not serious at all?
Of course, I am!
I'm really sorry.
Did it ever happen again? Did you see Roco again?
No.
I don't know. I just tried avoiding him.
Good morning, my lovely plants.
What happened?
-Call a doctor! Quick! -Brother!
Mom!
What happened to him? Mom!
What is it?
Mom!
What happened?
Roco, what happened?
We were just drinking when he started coughing…
…and vomited blood.
I already told you to stop drinking with him!
It's bad for his health!
It was just a few drinks…
My God! Walter!
Call a doctor!
Call a doctor, Walter!
Walter! Mom! Don't leave me!
Please don't leave me, Mom.
Bobby!
My son!
Bobby!
I didn't know what to feel.
I was sad, of course. My brother just died.
But on the other hand…
I'm free…
Brother's gone.
I'm free!
I know it's hard to understand.
But that's just how I felt.
I never felt bad for my brother.
I was just happy!
I was sad…
…but at the same time happy.
I finally felt free!
By the way,
-I'll just get our snacks. -Oh, you shouldn't have bothered.
No trouble at all.
How long have you been living here?
About less than a year.
Really?
Don't belittle the sweet potato.
That kept us alive during the war.
Thanks.
Boiled sweet potatoes…
Fried sweet potatoes…
Grilled sweet potatoes…
Stewed sweet potato tops…
And my favorite, sweet potatoes with syrup!
During the war,
were you already going out dressed in women's clothes?
My friends and I
were doing that long before the Japanese came!
We loved parading down Dewey Boulevard.
Who were your friends?
There were five of us in our group.
Carmen, Sophie, Anita, Minerva,
One more!
The Japs have arrived!
-They're here! -Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I'm Walterina.
Walterina.
Waiter!
What do you want?
Me too.
You're so clingy! Wait a minute.
What the…
You're not a woman!
So you want to be a woman?
You'll find out how it is to be a woman!
You stupid!
Stop it!
Hello? Send some soldiers in here!
What happened?
Isn't it obvious? They found out who we really are.
But Anita and I didn't get into any trouble?
Your muscles must've scared them off.
Or we're really just ready to bite.
Get down!
Wait, slowly.
Get off me!
Ouch!
Move!
What are they gonna do to us?
Get off me!
Don't push me!
Where are we? It's so dark.
-I'm scared. -Minerva, quiet!
Keep moving.
What is this place?
I'm scared.
Minerva, quiet!
Give me some!
Minerva!
Minerva, quiet!
Minerva, quiet!
Shh!
Wake up!
The Japs came back! They're here!
Beautiful?
I like this one!
I like the big one!
-All the same to me! -I can't understand them!
Then let's get on with it!
-Get off me! -Come on, guys!
Run, Walterina!
Get off me!
Please, don't!
Damn you!
Please, don't!
Help me!
Sophie! Help me!
Here. Eat.
-Eat. -No, thanks.
Eat.
-We don't need your food! -Stop it, sis!
That's enough, Minerva!
-You, monster! -Stop it, please!
Minerva, enough!
Hey, you!
-Hey, you! -Ouch! Enough, please!
That's enough!
That's enough!
-I said, enough! -Damn it!
Enough!
Enough!
It's okay, Anita.
Pigs!
You'll pay for this, you bastards!
I can't help but wonder how those beasts…
…could play such sad music.
What time is it?
On what part of the world?
What do you mean?
Here you go! Just pick whatever time zone you want!
What?
Stop messing with me!
We were treated like dirt.
If the comfort women took it from behind, we took it on all sorts of positions!
We were beaten up physically and mentally!
How long did that last?
It lasted a lifetime!
I can't remember and I certainly don't want to remember!
How did it end?
Did you escape?
Were you released?
Even martyrdom comes to an end.
We came to our senses.
Found our courage.
And the Japs got tired of gays.
They just let their guards down.
We found the chance to escape when the bombings started.
The war was ending?
No, the Japs were still in Manila.
And that episode doesn't end there.
We had our revenge!
Where are you off to?
Just out there…
Isn't it dangerous?
Sophie?
Are you trying to kill yourself, Sophie?
Do you think our lives are even worth living?
Besides,
it's none of your business.
It's up to you if you want to join me or not.
As for me, I'll just live in peace here.
I'm okay with this kind of life.
As long as I get to eat sour pork broth, sour fish broth,
or any kind of sour broth.
But do you even have sour pork broth?
-I don't, but-- -We can always eat sweet potato tops!
Just count me out.
His vengeance didn't last long.
One day, Sophie didn't come home.
We heard he was imprisoned in Fort Santiago.
-Hey! -Come on!
As for Carmen…
he was accused of robbery.
THIEF
Thief!
Carmen was a battered beauty…
But she survived.
Maybe she was terrified of dying.
We heard Sophie died in Fort Santiago.
When Manila was in chaos, we got separated.
I don't know what happened to that flirt, Minerva.
After the Liberation, I was still with Anita and Carmen.
I'm a little bloated. My period must be coming.
Walterina?
Walterina?
Who's that?
Walterina?
-Walterina! -Anita!
How are you?
Guess what I just bought in Escolta?
-You flirt! What did you get? -Guess!
A white soldier.
Oh, stop it!
Okay. A black soldier!
-Ouch! -Ouch!
Give up?
I give up. Show me.
-At last! -At last!
What's all that noise?
-What's going on here? -Look what Anita got!
You had me worried.
Get some herbs out back so I can start cooking.
May I?
How silky!
How smooth!
Oh, how good it is… to feel like a real woman.
It's just sad they're not here.
May their souls find peace.
Wherever they may be.
But for now…
Walterina Markova.
-Can i have a drink? -Yeah. Sure.
Give me light.
You want lights?
Like that!
Carmen?
Walterina.
How are you?
What happened to you? You just disappeared.
Here I am.
I went home to the province.
I tried to forget what happened.
I tried to change.
You wench.
You've never been uglier! It doesn't suit you.
It's funny.
Of all places, we had to see each other here.
But it's lonely here when you're alone.
Or are you here to get picked up?
You loon. Who's with you?
Him!
Does he know?
Of course.
I thought you were gone.
I wanted the old Carmen gone.
You know what all this pretending brought us.
You call this pretending?
Or just accepting who we are?
Tell me.
Will you be happy to forget the old Carmen?
After that, Carmen was back in her full glory!
We got together again for a gay parade in some faraway province.
It was fabulous!
Carmen was the Mystical Rose.
What happened to your American boyfriend?
Oh, it was just a ﬂing. A ﬂavor of the month.
He had a family in the States.
When his duty was over, that was the end.
When did you stop cross-dressing?
Well, beauty does fade.
Even Imelda Marcos grew older.
When I started working in the theater,
this hot babe was wearing pants.
Johnny's balls.
Oh Popoy, you're so vulgar!
What's vulgar about it? Just because you don't have any.
-Let me tell the joke. -Okay, go on.
-Johnny's balls. -Johnny's balls who?
It's not unusual That Johnny has two balls!
Popoy, you jerk! I knew it was vulgar!
-When you started to be comedian. -My goodness!
Water please.
So how was the show?
-The crowd loved us. -Oh, good.
It went well.
That's great.
I was a makeup artist in some theaters.
That's where I met the famous German Moreno.
But I don't know if he remembers me.
Then I worked for the Gala, the Greenline Theater,
I need an extra to buy these balloons.
Miss, stand over here. Pretend you're buying candles.
We're about to do a take! Is Chiquito ready?
He's still with make-up.
What's taking so long? We're about to shoot.
We're about to do the take, Chiquito.
Just a second. I will do a retouch.
I also worked in the movies.
I was the makeup artist of Chiquito,
a famous comedian, in Kenkoy & Rosing.
I felt so at home in the movies.
I had plenty of sisters there!
What a horrible director!
Don't mind him. He's just my assistant.
He acts like he owns the production company.
Start walking!
Hurry up, Kenkoy! We'll be late for the wedding!
Rosing!
This car goes well with my attire!
that we have our picture taken!
Oh my gosh!
-Yes, Kenkoy? -Take a picture of us.
-Of course, your wish is my command. -Isn't it embarrassing?
It's okay. I like you two.
Okay, just give me a moment to freshen up.
Young lady…
I turn my back for a second and you're already fooling around!
I just want our picture taken!
Oh, really?
-Stay right there. -Take our picture.
Hold on.
Wait, should we smile?
Go ahead and smile.
Come closer.
Like this?
You're so cute.
-And what's your name? -Walterina!
You still have lots to do! Stop ﬂirting with them!
Jerk.
Excuse me, boys. I still have to work. I'll be back to do your make-up.
Just a second.
Did you know that most actors today have gay benefactors?
For example?
I don't want to tattle.
Did you know that actor X is handled by a gay manager?
And did you also know that actor Y, who acts so macho,
lives with his gay lover?
And lastly, did you know that actor Z
is the Big Papa of another gay?
If I know, these guys are Rock Hudson's soul sisters.
And you? Who's your lover?
My lips are sealed.
I don't want to be accused of sexual harassment.
So?
What happened to Anita and Carmen?
Markova.
Your niece told me you were sick.
Isn't it obvious?
How are you?
Here she is…
no longer beautiful.
It's just a matter of seasons. Too bad ours has already passed.
At least you're still beautiful.
That's why I love you.
You're such a liar.
Darling.
Get a check up.
What?
Get a check up.
It's better to be sure.
You're as much a slut as I am.
Do you know what I have?
Your niece told me.
I never prayed so hard.
During the Occupation, I prayed everyday. But that was different.
That was war. Death was around every corner.
I was so nervous while waiting for the result of my blood test.
I didn't want to die of AIDS.
Walter Dempster, Jr.
Negative! I'm negative!
-It's negative! I'm negative! -What's negative?
-I'm negative! Yes! -What?
You wouldn't believe how grateful I was.
But I was also sad…
…because Anita didn't hold out much longer.
And what about Carmen?
What happened to her?
I heard she was sick, too. So I went to visit her.
Are you buying anything?
I hope you all win!
Tonypet!
-Where's the Fairy Queen? -Upstairs, resting.
-Just go ahead. -I'll go up.
You're so cute!
I want to steal you away!
-Hey, you! -Who's there?!
Thank God you visited me.
How's the movie queen?
I'm so weak.
I'm fading away like a wilted ﬂower.
It's all in your head.
No.
The doctor said I need a triple bypass.
But I have no money to pay for it.
-Well then get an overpass instead! -Oh, you!
-There's a lot of them on the highway. -Don't make fun of my misery.
Can you at least bring me my favorite pleasure?
Goodness!
Can you still do that in your condition?
Stop kidding around.
I'll die laughing.
No wonder Anita keeled over and died.
Poor Anita.
How are you?
-Well, we're now old hags. -Speak for yourself.
Your day will come too, you witch.
Come on. Buy me my favorite.
Hand over the cash. I don't have any.
Seriously?
Get some from Tonypet downstairs.
Voila!
Sour broth, my favorite!
Thanks for remembering, sister!
Surprise!
Oh, how delicious!
Hope you don't mind.
I couldn't find any fish broth. All they had was pork.
Isn't that bad for my health? All that cholesterol?
You want me to die quicker?
Don't you like that?
Oh, what the heck. At least I'll die of pleasure.
How delicious.
Carmen didn't last long either.
Just recently I went to the cemetery.
But I couldn't find the graves of those two.
It was a cemetery for the poor. Maybe the land was used for other bodies.
Enough. I've told you too much.
So you're the only one left from the gang?
Naturally, this old girl's getting old too.
I'm already "ty-three."
Ouch! You think I'm eighty-three?
That's way past the last bingo number. I'm only seventy-three.
Have you forgiven the Japanese?
Oh, come on.
Were you really a comfort gay?
If there were comfort women, we were the comfort gays.
Yeah, right.
And you don't mind us working in Japan?
What do I care if you want to work in Japan?
So it's okay with you that we serve the Japanese?
The blood kin of your abusers?
Not all the Japanese were bad.
And what's it to me if you lay out yourselves for them?
Girls, let's just be grateful that we have jobs.
You got that right.
But you know, I still find your story hard to believe.
If nobody listened to the comfort women, why would they listen to you?
And what happened to their case, anyway?
They're dying one by one, but nothing's happened.
And now, here you are. A comfort gay.
Wow. You're living in a fantasy world.
Maybe so!
It slipped!
Hey!
My hair!
My God!
That's the monk look.
But what if no one believes you?
Do you?
I don't know yet.
But it's not that I don't want to.
I still need to investigate.
Are journalists really like that?
Someone bares their soul to you and yet you still doubt them?
We need to be skeptical so we can see the truth.
They say only one thing can set a person free.
The truth.
How will you know the truth…
if you refuse to believe my story?
Freedom doesn't really come easy for people like us.
That's mine. Hey, that's mine!
It's mine. This is my life!
Come back for it when you believe me.
Sorry I wasted your precious time.
Loren! I'm glad you're still here.
What happened?
Hey, Loren!
Effeminate.
Queer!
Homosexual!
You're only being true to yourself!
But all they see…
How much time did you spend at the dresser compared to last week?
-Less. -How much less?
I don't know exactly.
You wanna make a guess, roughly, for the week?
Oh, not even an hour a day.
And...
...how long has it been now, since your loss?
You're hoping I guess again, aren't you?
How long?
Fourteen months, six days.
I can tell you what time it was, down to the hour and minute if you want.
I can't help it.
It's all right. It's just a memory doing its job.
-Hello? -Hey, what are you doing?
I'm just running out the door. I'm late for my appointment with Munce.
Listen, I was thinking maybe we could go out to dinner tonight.
I don't know. I think I'd rather stay home. I'm sorry.
All right, well, that's fine.
I'll cook something fancy.
No, no, no.
It's too much for you.
No, I want to.
Jim, I want to, okay?
-Hey, Eliot. -I miss you, sweetie.
-Where have you been? -I know. I haven't called.
Don't be silly. I didn't mean it like that. We haven't hung out in a while.
-Give me a call, we'll do something. -I'd love to. Bye.
You need some help?
I parked my car here. Right here, last night.
What kind of car is it?
Red Volvo.
Thanks.
I forget all the time.
Jim says I have a death grip on the past.
How are you getting along?
Did you fight at all this week?
Jim doesn't fight. He negotiates.
Are you comfortable physically? How's the sex?
How would you feel if I asked you that question?
How's the sex with Mrs. Munce?
Would you answer?
Yes, but I'd have to charge you more.
-What's wrong? -I-- I had my coffee.
No, not today.
No, I just had some.
I offered, but you said no this time.
Last time, you had a cup.
Memory slips.
I didn't forget. I can still taste the coffee.
You....
You smell my coffee, and you manufacture a memory, a taste.
That's all.
You do hang on hard.
Sometimes the mind...
...needs help in letting a thing go.
You expect me to let go of my son?
You think you amplify some of these memories of Sam?
Add to them?
No.
Why would I?
Hey. What's the occasion?
You going back to work.
-I think it's great. -It's just a freelance edit job.
-Not even sure I wanna do it. -I think you should do it.
It could be great for you. What's the book?
Psychotic Women and the Men Who Love Them.
No, I'm kidding. It's a children's book.
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Let me get the nice glasses your mother gave us. Okay?
-Speaking of psychotics. -Yeah.
What kind of a kids' book is it?
What have you done, Jim?
-What? -What have you done?
-Telly. -Why'd you change the picture?
-I didn't change anything. -Think this helps? Taking him away?
-Calm down. -I want the picture of the three of us.
What did you think, that I wouldn't notice? I wouldn't care?
I come here hoping to meet other swingers.
You're the first one.
We know each other. I'm Telly.
Remember? Telly Paretta. Sam's mom?
We're all tired of condolences, but I miss Lauren too.
Well, I'm....
I'm done for the night, so I gotta go.
You don't remember me.
-Sure. You want my swing? -No.
Do you want to come home with me?
-Just live over there. -Good night, Ash.
You do know me.
That's why you won't come home with me.
Jim.
Please don't ask me to let go.
Jim.
Mom, look.
Hurry up, Mom.
-There's your plane. -Yeah, I know.
Sam.
Jim Paretta, please.
Yeah, I'll take the voice mail.
I can't--
I can't believe what you did with the book and....
And I was so good...
...with the photos and the lock.
You still....
Do you want to make me hate you?
Do you want to make me hate you?
Please, oh, please.
Please. Please.
Telly?
Telly.
I can't...
...be with you anymore.
I don't wanna see you anymore.
-Telly, wait. -The book....
The book, I can lose, but--
You erased our son.
You erased my boy. You made it all blank.
-You took him away. -Stop. They were always blank.
-What? What are you saying? -You're healing. You're coming back.
-Dr. Munce is coming. -Let me go! Let me go!
This is good. God, Telly, this is real.
The tapes were always blank.
Do you know what he's telling me?
Yes.
Is he psychotic?
No.
My child.
My Sam.
Telly.
There was never a Sam Paretta.
You never had a son.
-This is insane. -I'm so sorry.
I wanted to help you slowly.
-Gently. But I never thought you-- -He erased the tapes.
He replaced the book. How can you believe him?
Sam, he grew up. He was 9.
Nine. I had nine years of memories.
Invented memories, Telly. It happens.
People do this. It's called paramnesia.
-You imagined a life-- -Everyone remembers Sam.
-Everyone. -Telly.
You had a miscarriage.
Your life was in danger. The baby was premature.
-It was stillborn. You almost died. -Stop it.
Post-traumatic shock. It affects everyone differently.
Some people actually invent entire alternate lives...
...with imagined friends and lovers and children.
Stop. Why are you doing this? Why are you trying to take him away?
I made him up? I made him up?
This is so simple. There are photographs.
People with your condition look at a photo and see...
...what their mind tells them to see. You used to see Sam.
-No. Sam took that picture. -You're recovering.
There was a woman. We asked her to take a picture...
...and that's the one that Jim took away. We have a million photographs.
No. No, he took the real book away!
Telly.
Telly, I was hoping we could do this without hospitalising you.
All right, all right.
No, there-- There....
There are....
There are photos that he didn't take.
I'll show you.
And we'll end this. We'll end this.
Telly.
Let's just sit down.
Telly.
Telly! Telly!
Where are you going? Where are you--? Telly!
I need to see some newspapers.
Daily papers from 14 months ago.
You need to fill this out.
What papers do you need?
How could--?
How could it not be in any of these?
You sure of the date?
What are you trying to find?
"Six Brooklyn Children Feared Dead in Missing Plane."
How could it not--?
I have to go.
I have to go.
-Eliot. -Christ.
Telly. What are you doing in the dark?
What's wrong?
I had a fight with Jim.
Oh, I'm sorry. Come inside.
We fought about Sam.
I'm sorry, about what?
Sam.
Sam. Who's Sam, sweetie?
Eliot, he's my son.
Your son?
El, please.
You knew my son. You babysat him a thousand times.
-I don't know what you're trying to say. -You knew my son.
You talked to him, you took him to a Mets game...
...you bought him a hat. He always wore that hat.
You're scaring me. Tell me what's wrong.
Telly?
Telly!
Telly!
Who the hell is it?
It's Telly Paretta. Ash, please.
Are you gonna go away?
No.
Remember me?
Yeah.
Who am I?
You're in worse shape than I am.
What the hell are you doing?
I was here once before, with my son.
-Do you remember? -You an old fan, is that it?
Oh, yeah. That's-- That's right. You--
You were a hockey player.
Ex-Ranger. Lauren was very proud of that.
-Well, tell Lauren I appreciate it. -I don't follow hockey.
My son, Sam, was a baseball fan.
Oh, baseball.
It's a great game.
The only sport you can play while taking a nap.
-You drinking? -No, I just wanted to talk to you.
About what?
Your daughter. I don't have a daughter.
Do you get drunk every night?
No. Sometimes I'm drunk by noon.
-What do you want? -I had a son.
My son and your daughter were friends...
...and I'd come here sometimes to drop Sam off or pick Lauren up.
Can we talk about this after?
After what?
After I sleep.
Somebody else has a daughter, you know.
Somebody else knows your son.
It's not me.
That's nice.
Did we get married?
It's not me.
It's you. It's Jim.
I don't know who else or what else.
I don't know anything.
I don't know why it's not in the papers.
I don't know anything.
But it's not me. I'm not insane.
Go look in your office. It used to be your daughter's room.
You let her draw on it. These are her drawings.
-What did you do? -She was showing Sam her room.
I was there. Her bed was here.
Her desk was here, with pictures from magazines, collaged.
-You're out of your mind. -This was her room.
Somebody lived here before me. They papered over their kid's room.
-I'm calling the cops. -We were there, at the awful funerals.
-You and me and your ex-wife. -Get out!
You seemed much more upset than your wife.
She was like my husband, she held it in.
-But you and I-- -Listen, listen, listen!
We have never met at a funeral. I do not know you.
Lauren and Sam were friends. We put them on a plane together...
...to go to camp and we lost them. They died over a year ago.
-Come on. -You weren't drinking then.
-How do you know that? -I met you.
You weren't like this.
It was about 14 months ago you started drinking, wasn't it?
Wasn't it?
That's when Lauren died.
-I never had a kid. -You remembered her before this.
Everybody remembered our children. Something happened...
...in the last weeks or days, I don't know, but our children have been forgotten.
-That's it. Let's go. Come on! -No, no! Say her name, and I'll go!
I say his name every day!
Just say it.
So you can hear it. Lauren.
Say it.
Lauren.
Now look around again.
She was here.
She lived here.
-I need a minute. -Tell me if--
I need a minute.
-Do you want some coffee? -No, thanks.
I know this is difficult.
How much do you remember?
I-- I called the police.
Look, you need some help. I never had a kid.
You gotta get some help. I'm--
I'm real sorry.
Yeah.
One second, okay?
It's the best thing.
They say I dreamed it all.
Do you think I dreamed it?
We have to go.
Hi, Carl Dayton, National Security Agency.
Telly Paretta? We're taking custody.
-Can I see some ID? -Check with Captain Mills. He'll verify.
Hi, Dad.
Sorry, Dad.
Which one do you think I should wear, Daddy?
Wait! Wait!
-Where is she? -The feds have her.
Stop.
-You gotta let her go. -Mr. Correll, step back.
You don't understand.
Telly. Get off--
-I remember. I remember. -Get off.
I remember.
-Get him off the car! -I remember.
Get off me. She's right!
-Grab his hands! -Run!
Run!
Run!
-T-E-L-L...? -Y. Telly.
They told me there was a complaint against her.
She trashed an apartment and wouldn't leave.
-Who? Whose apartment? -Mr. Ashley Correll. Do you know him?
-No. -Ex-New York Ranger.
-Pretty good. -What does he have to do--?
She was claiming her son was missing and dead.
We never had a son.
Why would she say that?
My wife is delusional. She needs help.
Where is she?
She was turned over to federal agents.
And she fled custody. Now, Mr. Paretta...
...why would the NSA be interested in your wife?
You're asking me? This is crazy.
They don't care about anybody's apartment.
-And they don't trace missing children. -There was never a child.
Do what they say, all right?
Okay. I love you.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
-Bye. -Bye-bye.
Have fun.
I love you, Mommy.
-Sam. -Yeah?
-See you. -See you.
I was hoping you'd come here.
Me too.
I don't understand it.
I keep thinking I'm crazy, you know?
How could I forget her?
My little girl.
How--?
I can't do this.
You have to.
Because I can't do this alone.
Come on, we shouldn't hang around here.
First, I thought it had to do with the plane crash.
Remember when that flight crashed over Long Island...
...and everybody thought it was friendly fire...
...some government cover-up?
-Yeah, I remember that. -But then I thought...
...how could the government erase our memories?
It's just not possible. It's so--
-What? -Please don't think...
-...I'm out of my mind. -I don't anymore.
Do you ever feel like somebody--?
Something's watching you?
Like surveillance?
No, I mean that sometimes people are...
...taken. We hear that.
-What are you talking about? -Abduction.
You're freaking me out. I'm having a National Enquirer moment.
No, listen to me. What do we know?
I had a son, you had a daughter, they had lives...
...they died, and everyone besides us believes they never existed.
What could do something like that?
No. There's gotta be another explanation.
Who could erase our kids? Every-- Every picture of them gone.
Every newspaper article gone. Every memory gone.
No agents. No government. Who could do that?
I don't know.
We need to find a hotel. You got any cash?
No, not much. I have some credit cards.
Forget it. Clerk runs your card, and they got us.
Don't you watch TV?
I read.
Goddamn snob.
No. Goddamn editor. Why are you so pissed at me?
-You okay? -Yeah.
My door.
-NSA! We need to talk to you! -Just stay by the car!
Stay by the car!
This way!
-Where did they go? -In here!
In here!
Get down.
Goddamn it, we've lost them.
All right, search the fields. We'll check the streets.
All right. Come on.
I got left side.
-Petalis, come in. -Go for Petalis.
What do you see? Nothing there?
-Yeah, the field's clear. -Okay, hook up with us.
Okay. I'm coming back to you.
What's your 20?
-Hello? -Dr. Munce, it's Telly.
Telly. Where are you? Are you all right?
No.
I mean, I'm not hurt, but there are people after us.
What? What do you mean?
I found someone else.
His daughter was on the same flight. He didn't remember her.
But now he does.
How do you explain that?
How do you explain the people chasing us?
Telly, this is a panic attack. You just hold on, all right?
Now, tell me where you are, I'll leave right away. You need help.
No, I need you to start believing me.
Found an all-night place.
Didn't have much.
You should eat something.
Just deciding whether I want too much salt or too much sugar.
Sugar.
Wish you wouldn't do that.
Don't worry about it.
Think I'm just gonna go to bed.
-You held out. -What?
You held out and I didn't. I forgot her.
-How'd you do that? -I don't know.
What's so important about us? Or our kids?
I mean, the kids are dead.
Why try to erase our memories?
It's not like we're gonna go look for them.
Sam.
Ash.
Ash. Wake up.
Come on.
Come on, wake up. Wake up.
Wake up, wake up. Come on. Wake up.
Wake up.
Wake up!
Ash.
Ash.
Wake up.
-Listen to me. -What the hell are you doing?
-You nutjob! -Listen to me.
You didn't know it, but you were right.
If the children were dead, they would leave it.
If we all thought they were dead, why would they erase them?
Why would they need to make us forget them?
I think the children are alive.
That's why I can still feel him, why I can't let go. The children are alive.
Don't you feel that Lauren's alive out there?
I don't know, maybe.
Yes.
Jim usually leaves the office by 12:15.
We need to get Jim alone.
-What's he like? -We had our problems.
He loved Sam.
Make him say Sam's name.
Like you made me say "Lauren."
-Watch out! -Get out of the way!
Behind you!
Get out of the way!
Oh, my God!
-Is he--? Did we--? -I don't know.
I've seen him before.
Don't answer it.
-Hello? -Hello, is this Telly Paretta?
-Who is this? -Telly, this is Detective Anne Pope.
We didn't mean to hurt anybody.
The man in front of our car wouldn't get out of the way.
-What? -We're just trying to find our children.
-Hang up. -Yes, I know.
-You know? -I know about your case.
Hang up.
Is that Ashley Correll?
They took our kids.
They made us think they died in the plane crash.
Anne. Look, I know this doesn't make any sense...
...but my son, Sam Paretta, and Ash's daughter, Lauren Correll...
...they were on the same plane.
Now, how could two people...
...remember two different children if they never existed?
Jim.
Hi. I....
I'm sorry, do I know you?
What's the matter? It's me.
I'm lost. Can you help me out here?
Oh, God, what did they do to you?
It's me. It's Telly.
I'm sorry. We know each other?
I know your wife.
Right. Got it. Not married. Wrong Jim.
James William Paretta.
Who are you?
Do you know a Sam Paretta?
-No relation. -Maybe it would help...
...if you said the name. Sam.
You lost me.
What about Jim?
It's them.
We gotta get out of here. Out of the city, at least for tonight.
I know someplace far enough.
-Telly. -He didn't even know me.
He forgot me.
Swear to God. They hit the guy, he crashes into the pump. Look.
Look at that. Then he gets right up. I didn't just see it, I heard it. Bang.
This guy bounces off the gas pump, gets right up.
There's no blood.
There's gotta be.
-Feds wanna talk to you. -What?
Detective Pope.
Okay, wait right here, all right?
I'm Carl Dayton, NSA.
-So you're here to rent a car? -Pardon?
What are you doing in my crime scene, Carl?
What's so national security about this?
-I'm not at liberty to say. -Liberty to say.
You guys need new material.
We've been on this case.
So any new information that you get on Paretta or Correll...
...you give me a call any time, day or night.
You like this part, don't you?
The part where you get to take away my case.
I'd rather be sailing.
I'm conducting an investigation here.
And until I know differently, Paretta and Correll...
...have been breaking only the laws of New York.
I am the city of New York, and I'm on it.
Your involvement wouldn't have to do with the plane crash...
-...they claim killed their two children? -Children?
There are no children.
But there was a plane crash.
No.
We know nothing about a plane crash.
You don't know very much.
National security, huh?
Better buy better locks.
Put your eyes back in your head, warden.
I'm not looking at you.
I had a wife.
Could feel a woman's eyes judging me if I was in a coma.
Ash, please don't drink.
See, I told you you were watching me.
You know what?
-I wish I didn't have to. -Then don't. I'm sick of hearing it.
Sorry to interrupt your feeling sorry for yourself.
Well, not all of us can be heroes, lady.
You think I wouldn't drink that entire bottle for a few seconds of peace?
You're in this. You don't get to drink your way out.
What makes you so fucking special?
I let her go.
My little girl.
They took her away from me, but I let her go.
What kind of father does that?
I need you to stay clear.
-I'm not doing this for you, you know. -I know.
I'll never forget her again.
I know you won't.
You know everything, right?
I don't know how to get my son back.
We'll figure something out.
-And? -Dayton? He is NSA, but it's tagged.
He's got special clearance. Some unit within the NSA.
-These people are down deep. -Doing what?
I'd say God only knows, but I don't think he's in the loop.
I gotta pick up my sister's kid. Get some sleep.
Good night. I need you to get that on my desk--
-Excuse me, Lieutenant Pope? -No, I'm gone, in my car.
-I'm almost home. -I'm Dr. Jack Munce.
Telly Paretta's my patient.
I'd like to help. Telly's contacted me.
What can you tell me about Telly that might help me find her?
I used to think that she was purely delusional.
I'm not sure anymore.
So how is it that she and Mr. Correll are having the same delusion...
...making up imaginary children from the same plane crash?
Well, I don't-- I don't know Correll.
He could be saying anything to be with her.
Well, if she calls again, call me.
I think it's important that I'm there when you find her.
You'll be dealing with a psychotic break.
You don't wanna do more damage.
-I'll call you, Dr. Munce. -No, that's not what I mean.
It's.... It's my fault she's out there.
Why?
She was in my care.
She still trusts me, or she wouldn't have called.
She'll call again and when she does, you'll know because I'll be with you.
You're gonna need me to find her.
Oh, shit.
"A. Petalis."
What's the A stand for?
What?
-You don't have to do that. -This?
Just stop it!
Al.
Al Petalis.
You don't want this kind of trouble, so just drop it right now. Right now!
Tell him to stop, Miss Paretta, before this goes any further. Tell him!
We just want our children.
There are no children. Forget the children.
What did you say? Did you say to forget the children?
-Who are you? -Where are the children?
Why were they taken? Why were the children taken?
If I swing this thing again, I'm gonna break your kneecap.
I swear it.
Where are the children?
No! No, I--
It's not me, it's....
It's not us. We.... We....
We cooperate.
Cooperate with who?
With who?
Why do you cooperate with them?
-Survival. -Who, yours?
Yours too.
You were right.
Where are they from? Who are they? Why do they want the children?
Tell us the truth.
The truth.
The goddamn truth won't fit in your brain.
It won't fit in anybody's brain.
Just tell us how to get the children back.
I don't know. I don't know anything about that.
All I know is that you were supposed to forget like everybody else did.
This was not part of it.
Part of what?
Part of what?
Part of...
...this particular experiment.
-Go on. -I can't.
-Yes, you can! -No, I won't.
-Yes, you can! Yes, you--! -No! No!
Do you have children?
Please.
Please tell me.
No one will know that you told us.
Just--
Just tell us...
...how to get the children back.
No one will blame you.
I swear to you. I swear to you.
They're listening.
You okay?
-Why didn't they take us? -I don't know.
Our best guess is a gas leak.
But nothing's burned. There's no sign of fire.
There's no sign of blood.
Just this.
"Anne Pope, our children are alive. We believe they were abducted.
We know we couldn't sound crazier if we tried. Please help us."
Abducted.
That's an interesting word.
Most people say kidnapped.
-Troopers found this. -Excuse us, Dr. Munce.
Witnesses only saw Paretta and Correll...
...running from the cabin after the explosion.
And there's no sign of another body inside.
Where did this come from?
Brasher, how old's Cassidy?
She's 7, why?
What if I told you your daughter never existed? That you made her up?
Why would you do that?
Yeah. Why?
QuestAir. The name of the airline, the small airline.
It was QuestAir. Remember?
QuestAir. So....
So we're saying that it never crashed at sea.
We're saying that they somehow took the kids...
...and that the-- The plane and the pilot...
...that all of it, all of it is part of them.
QuestAir.
Oh, my God. Who are you? What are you doing here?
Sorry, we didn't think there'd be anyone here. I'm Claire.
I'm Mr. Shineer's assistant. And you are?
Eileen, the accountant the court appointed for the bankruptcy.
-Oh, of course. I'm so sorry. -That's all right.
I was told that QuestAir employees are not allowed here.
That's okay. Mr. Shineer needs some items from his office.
Oh, no. I'm sorry. Nothing is allowed to leave.
They're just personal letters.
Yes, well, if anything turns up, I'd be happy to have them...
...sent to Mr. Shineer's home.
I'm gonna go by court procedure.
That's fine. The West Side address isn't good anymore, though, the co-op.
Which one do you have?
Where would I have that?
Let's see what I've got here.
Okay, Robert Shineer. I've got the one on Long Island.
165 Colony Way.
Nobody lives here.
Yeah, that's strange.
They didn't move out, they just left.
-Go ahead, you should sleep. -What about you?
I'm finally awake.
-Hey, get in. -Where are we going?
They've been ID'd. They scammed an accountant for an address. Long Island.
Ash.
-Shineer. -Ash?
Telly.
-Look. It's the guy from the car rental. -I know.
We have to get to the airport, the one the kids left from.
They're in the house with us.
Come on, let's go.
It's jammed.
-Meet me at my apartment. -What are you doing?
One of us has gotta get out of here. Go. Go on. Go!
Stay here.
Stay inside.
Freeze. Right there. Hands on your head.
I want you on your knees. Now.
I will shoot.
Now.
Halt!
Halt!
-Are you Munce? -Yes. What happened in there?
-Where's Telly? -Telly left. We gotta get out of here.
-What about Pope? -You wanna help? Drive.
Drive!
Come on.
Telly! Telly, wait.
Telly, I'm Anne. Anne Pope.
No, wait. Please listen.
I know. I know.
I believe you, Telly. I believe you about everything.
I've seen it. It's not human. Jesus Christ.
-And the children? -Yes, everything.
We'll find them. I promise you that. Do you hear me? We will find them.
We will find your son--
Telly?
Ash?
Ash.
They took Anne Pope right in front of me.
Munce is downstairs.
-He'll take us to that airport. -Beautiful view.
What have you done with our kids?
Ash.
-No, Telly. Stay back! -Ash.
No!
Ash!
No!
Ash!
Telly.
Come with me.
-We have to go to the police. -No, we have to go to the airport.
Please, Telly. We need help.
Get out.
No, I'll take you.
He's one of them. You have my son. Where is he?
You know this is getting out of control.
It's finished now, end it.
Make it right.
Where is my son?
It's not over.
You're one of those agents.
No, I'm just...
...one of the few who knows.
So you help them?
They don't need help. They run their experiments with or without our help.
They've been doing it for years. Maybe forever.
And you just let them do whatever they want.
Let them?
I don't have a choice.
We just try to minimize the damage.
I just want my son.
Telly, you'll never get Sam back.
You've held on, and they don't know why. You're just a lab rat to them.
I don't believe that. He said it's not over. I can still get him back.
You know them. Help me.
If you go any further, I can't help you. I'm sorry.
Is my son in here?
You never doubted.
Not for a second, did you?
He's here.
He's now just a memory, Telly.
Can you picture him here?
Now?
Sam!
Honey! Wait!
Sam!
Sam!
What have you done with him? Why did you take him? What do you want?
It's an experiment.
He's just a little boy. What could you possibly learn from him?
Nothing.
This wasn't about Sam.
This wasn't about the children.
It was never about the children.
We were the experiment.
Your connection, mother to child.
Like an invisible tissue. We can even measure its energy.
But we don't fully understand it, so I posed the question:
"Can it be dissolved?" And it can.
Except for you.
Give me back my son...
...and I'll do whatever you want.
What I want, Telly, is for you to forget your son.
-To forget Sam. -No.
If you don't, this experiment will fail.
I'm accountable.
I can't let that happen.
And time is running out.
I won't help you.
There are worse things than forgetting.
No, there aren't.
You need to forget.
You're different from the others.
Why?
It's better this way.
You won't be haunted by his memory.
You could have a life again.
Now, I want you to go back to that first day in the hospital.
To the first time you ever saw Sam.
I need that first memory.
Give me that first memory.
That boy. What was his name?
What boy?
I had life inside of me.
I had life.
I have a child.
I have a son.
I...
...have a son.
His name is Sam, you son of a bitch.
I need more time.
Sam!
Sam!
Sam! Sam!
Sam Paretta, do you know him?
Sam!
Hey, Mom.
It's not time to go yet, is it?
Mom, I can't breathe.
I'm sorry. I just....
-I just wanted you to button up. -Can I play till 5:30?
-Yeah. -Okay.
-Yeah, 5:30's okay. -Okay. Thanks.
See you.
See you.
Hi, Lauren.
Hi.
Hi.
I guess they....
-They don't want parents around. -No.
You keep watching him.
It's hard not to.
They're okay.
I know.
...eyes open, down a rabbit hole, plummeting into chaos...
...come out the other end unchanged?
The answer?
She doesn't.
See, I know, because that girl is me.
But to truly understand the predicament I was in...
...i.e., stuck in the middle of chaos...
...you'd have to go back to that first day at my new job.
Actually, to be fair, you should go back a little further...
...starting with Mom. Don't worry. I'm not blaming her...
...entirely.
She believed that all problems could be solved by listening to Carly Simon.
Greatest Hits.
Side two. Hurry.
Something about her voice, or her lyrics, or her music...
...helped Mom clear the chaos...
...especially after a fight with Dad.
Or when he left us for good.
People said Mom was better off.
They said she was lucky. But she believed....
Luck is when preparation meets opportunity.
You gotta prepare for the life you want.
And though I knew I wanted a career in broadcast journalism...
...it took a little Carly and a lot of time...
...to find the person I most wanted to work with.
-She is smart and she is learning. -Diane Sawyer.
-Chic, smart, intelligent-- -And she married well.
Good point.
-She's a little beige. -No, no, she's taupe.
Taupe is never beige. Taupe's classic. Confident.
-It says, "I'm elegant." -"And I don't need color to prove it."
There you go. I wanna work with her one day.
-You should work with her. -I will work with her.
With my career decided, I left for college...
...hopeful I would meet someone I could be certain of.
-Phillip. -Bruce.
-Jeremy. -Noah.
-Trotsky. -Frank.
-Bean. -Bean? As in, "How have you...?"
Bean. Yeah.
-I really, really like him, Mom. -You do?
Yeah, I do. I think I do. Maybe.
Don't over-commit yourself unless you are absolutely certain.
You've gotta prepare for the life you want.
Again, I turned to Carly.
And while my roommates weren't as understanding as I'd hoped...
-Come back to bed. -...it did bring certainty.
I'm sorry, Bean.
We have only but one road to travel in this life.
And I just don't think we're on the same one.
So to get more involved, or for me to over-commit myself...
...would just lead to chaos.
-How do you know? -I'm certain.
I mean, what if you're wrong?
What if we're supposed to be together?
What if you just made the biggest mistake of your life?
Stacy, honey! Smile!
There are moments in life where you hope your decisions weren't rash.
Bean! Bean!
And moments where you just know.
-Stacy. -Derek.
-Nice to meet you. -Yeah, ditto.
I had met my life-mate. I was certain.
Yeah! Yes!
-That's good. Yes? -The bar's closed.
What are you doing?
That first year of our relationship was amazing.
We were in sync, inseparable...
...and in love.
And though I technically still lived with Mom...
...I was spending practically all my time at Derek's.
My life was going according to plan. Sort of.
-Derek! -Bob! Bob!
Professionally speaking, I was the go-to girl in a dead-end job.
I mean, you can only work your way up for so long, right?
It was time to move on.
And while Diane Sawyer was still out of reach...
...television personality Kippie Kann wasn't.
The grande dame of daytime talk needed an associate producer. Me.
It was a match made in Trenton.
-Which brings us up to speed. -Ira Nachlis. Follow.
The beginning of the end. Day one.
Tight on space, but your desk is right next to....
-Barb. -Campbell-hyphen-Dunn.
Meet our new associate producer, Stacy Hoyt.
-Holt. -Whatever.
Put your stuff down. I'll take you to the taping.
We got pictures of strippers he's been with.
Cheating bastard.
They call it "fluffing." Prepping the guests.
We got proof. Go on, now. Be strong. And violent.
By the time they're on, they're ready to go nine rounds.
So there's two shows today, 9 and 3.
Nine is "Cheating Bastards." My idea.
-I owe you one, Bea. -Oh, no problem.
That's a great idea. Why aren't you producing?
I am. Carl just takes credit.
Deep breath.
And showtime.
Pathway, people!
I'm on my way! I'm on my way!
Anybody have tickets for Thomas Oglestein?
I haven't proofed these yet. They look okay to you?
Did you use the words "dope," "dog" and "stripper"?
-They're fine. -They're fine.
Is it just me? I think the horse in Montana is missing his feedbag.
I just got word we're about ready to start. But before we do...
...I want you to get to know each other. Turn to the person behind you...
...and shake hands. That would be great.
You guys are not that bright. We are really gonna start....
-I lost my scream. -What?
-Got doorbell, buzzer, beating heart-- -No scream, no show!
-Barb! -No scream, no show!
Go, Barb.
Run title!
Stand by, DP.
-Nice, Barb. -And cue applause.
-Standing by. -Stand by, Kippie.
Go gray. And cue Kippie.
There she is!
Hey, nice to see you.
Hello.
She's getting ahead of you. Stand by, camera three.
-Camera three. -Carl, what are you looking at?
Welcome to Kippie Kann Do!
Today we're putting the dogs to the ultimate test.
-Is your man a cheating bastard? -No!
Then he'll have to pass the Kippie Kann Lie Detector to prove it.
-Phil, camera two. -Camera two ready.
-Cue doorbell. -Full scream.
Better get that.
Yeah! Bring it on, sucker!
What up? What?
-Cue apes. -Apes?
Security.
Yeah, represent!
What? What? What?
Rapper Boy Taye, why do you think you're here?
I'm here because my woman's getting a hot hoochie-mama makeover.
-Camera four. -I'd do her.
There is some kind of critter under the table.
It's either a rat....
My sister saw you humping on a dirty-girl stripper.
Dirty-girl stripper?
You crazy! I never been with no stripper.
That ain't your grandma.
-That ain't me. -Liar!
-You're stupider than you look. -No, you didn't!
What are you, crazy?
-You're a dirty dog! -Now let's not rush to judgment.
-Are you willing to prove it, Taye? -Yeah.
-What do you say, audience? -Prove it! Prove it! Prove it!
I got nothing. Lori, what's up?
-Another guest? -Do we have the right running order?
-Should we have someone? -Who's up?
-I'm sorry. -I don't have this.
Hello? Anyone there?
Oh, Jesus! Kippie's gonna--
-There she blows. -Kippie can't keep covering, Carl!
-Good girl. -Is anybody in the booth...
...or is it just me down here by myself? I'm all alone down here!
What are you guys doing? You're crazy!
-Carl! -What was the problem, Phil?
Oh, shoot, there it is! It's a big one!
Okay, people, lots to do. We got two shows today.
First I wanna say hello to our new associate producer...
...our little doorbell-ringer herself, Stacy Holt.
-What's up, girl? -Just kidding, Stace. Just a little fun.
Welcome to our little thing.
Katie, you wanna show them the--?
Take a look at our new look.
-"Kippie Kann keeps competitors...." -He's bringing back the hard K's.
-Keep going, Katie. Keep it going. -It was her thing, like a trademark.
--"creatively while keeping keen"....
-But that was a million years ago. -Nostalgia, folks.
Hearkens back to a simpler time. They eat it up.
Like when Captain Kangaroo was king and Casey Kasem was in kindergarten.
-He's nuts. -Who invented reality?
-We did. -So keep those hard K's coming.
-Kipp, you should be in makeup, kiddo. -Cut the K's, Carl.
-It's cute. It's Kippie. -It's crap! Capisce?
Here's the thing:
That orchid on the desk? Well, I just got it.
Which can only mean it's a new picture.
Let me see that.
She's right. This cruelty cannot continue. Katie.
-Carl. -If somebody has a problem with me...
-...just tell me straight up. Otherwise-- -You get canned. With a "C."
Kippie, to makeup.
-Good girl. -I told you.
I'll do my best to catch the culprit, Kippie.
Thank you....
Ira.
Nachlis.
Nice to meet you.
I've worked here for three years.
Okay, people, need you focused right here!
It's all about sweeps.
Give me drama, pathos, life unfolding.
Make me cry. Ira.
Regurgitate something fresh.
-"Midget Holiday Hell." -Stinks.
-Come on. Give it to Daddy. -"Parents Who Party."
-Come on. Give it to Daddy. -"Parents Who Party." -Who do they party with? -Rejecting the midgets?
-Who do they party with? -Rejecting the midgets?
-Midgets. -What?
Mixed parents. Happy mixed parents.
-One normal size.... -One midget?
-Sexy. I like it. -Those midgets are mine!
You can't corner the midget market! Yours party during holidays.
-Mine party as a family. -Are they happy?
-It'd make you cry. -Kippie is great with sentiment.
-Give me that thing! -Don't! Don't touch me!
-He has no happy midgets! -Gentlemen, please!
We combine the segments. We share the credit and the midgets.
We work together here, people. We are a team.
-"Grandma's a Hooker." -You got a grandma?
-Several. -Run the prep.
-"Penitentiary Porn." -"Little Black Books."
-Do not follow. -Electronic little black books.
-As in? -As in Palms...
...BlackBerries, desk organizers. Electronic footprints...
...of where your man has been and with whom.
Under the right circumstances, they could be a girl's best friend.
Especially a scorned girlfriend, wife, mistress--
-I think it's a fantastic idea. -Thank you!
-Since our audience is 90% female-- -Sexy! Run the prep.
Let's go! Come on.
-"Pregnant Strippers"! -"Black Midgets with Books"!
-"Unnatural Animal Love." -"Literacy in Inner-City Schools."
Shit! Take it back. Take it back.
She was just kidding.
And I tried to pretend I was.
First the doorbell, then the staff meeting?
I am absolutely mortified.
Don't worry, no one will remember.
-You can ring my bell -Hey, stop it!
-Ring my bell -She's really upset.
Oh, please. I'm the only victim here.
Why should I be forced to share credit with--?
-Not fair. -Your midget idea was tired.
-His twist made it different. -Thanks, I feel so much better.
If you make sweeps even with shared credit, that's a huge deal.
I happen to know that the people from Harpo, Oprah's group...
...TiVo every one of our shows.
For what it's worth, I really like your "Little Black Book" idea.
-Really? -Yeah. So don't cry in my soup.
-So how does it all work exactly? -You put your best shows in sweeps.
The most outrageous, the most provocative attention-grabbers.
-Then they promo it. -It's about getting eyeballs...
...to get numbers, to get revenue, to get renewed.
We're beginning sweeps now, so things are in the can.
-So, what was pitched today? -June sluts.
Slots. Of which we average nine a month.
"We" being the drones. The APs. When an AP gets a slut-- Slot.
It's like a credit. You need so many credits to advance.
-And you have the most? -Catching on.
He's next. The only way to jump ahead of him is if you land the live show.
-Please. -This month?
-A week from Friday. -APs never get the live show.
-Karen Meskil. -Urban legend.
Anyway, if you do, you're instantly promoted.
-Wow. -Hi, Barbara.
Hey, Kippie. Great show.
Let's not go there. You must be Stacy.
Wow. I am so unbelievably sorry about what happened.
Please. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
Hello again.
Ira.
-Nachlis. -Yes, you are.
So sorry to hear about you and Neil. I thought he was a keeper.
Kippie?
-Sorry. Excuse me. -Bye.
-Who's Neil? -My boyfriend.
Ex, actually.
"Hi, Barbara. How's Neil? You must be Stacy."
What's missing here? Oh, me!
You're right. I should get as many shows on the air as possible. Be seen.
Noticed by somebody. Anybody.
Okay, so, what I'm about to do should not be interpreted as groveling...
...hypocrisy, or desperation. It's merely a loss of personal integrity.
Excuse me. Larry, wait up!
-He's funny. -Yeah. Talented too.
Okay, I'll do the midgets.
-Too bad he'll never make it here. -Why not?
He cares too much what everyone thinks. Especially Kippie.
-And that's bad because...? -They're shopping for a newer model.
-But she's the boss. -It's been in the works a long time.
Who do you think leaked the pictures to the tabloids?
Her ratings are down, and she's got five years left on her contract.
You do the math.
-So is it always like this? -I don't know.
I haven't been here long enough to say.
-No, I thought you were-- -A lifer?
No. A year and a half ago I was on Wall Street.
And before that I drove a bus.
It's all pretty much the same.
People will tell you who they are if you just listen.
You can figure them out. Sometimes you can help.
-Let's help Kippie. -I should warn you.
I'm uncomfortable with touching and sentiment.
-Sorry. -Thank you.
It's all about the bottom line.
-In every business. -Does she know?
She used to be prime-time out of New York.
Now she's syndicated in Jersey.
It's one thing to start here, but you don't climb your way to Trenton.
Nothing we can do, short of winning sweeps.
-Well, then let's win sweeps. -Oh, okay.
-We could try. -Win one for the Kipper?
-We could try. -Win one for the Kipper? -Please. -This is too earnest for me.
You've been teetering, and you just crossed over.
-Don't you like her? -I do, actually.
A lot. But that's irrelevant.
That may be so, but does it reveal who your true friends are?
Are they keeping secrets?
Well, it's not a secret anymore for someone...
...and we'll tell you why after these words. Hey!
Man, you should have seen what came out of this animal.
I miss all the good stuff.
-Think you're pretty cute, don't you? -Well, I'm no Bob.
You better apologize.
I think you just insulted Bob.
-You insinuated ugliness. -I did not. I did not.
-Apologize. -Okay, okay! I'm sorry, Bob. I'm sorry.
-Wait. Where are you going? -I gotta finish packing. Two minutes.
Did I tell you about Nieuwendyk's cousin? MVP out of Detroit?
Guess who he's seeing Friday morning. His request.
Yeah, you told me. It's amazing.
Honey, this fast-forward thing isn't working.
-Oh, my God! -What?
-Oh, it's the gas. -Oh, God!
-Bob, get down. Come here, boy. -Open a window. Honey....
Yeah, plus Robbie Moore, out of Buffalo?
These guys are, like, the top two recruits in the country.
And if I can nail them both....
No ifs. You will. I know it.
-Oh, what is the matter with that Bob? -Burrito.
-Want me to take him out? -Later.
-I can do it right now. -No.
Positive?
Jesus wept! Bob!
No more hot sauce, all right?
-Why are you feeding him hot sauce? -I don't know.
-What are you watching? -Oh, Kippie.
-I'm studying the format. -Tell us how bulimia...
-...affected your relationships, Lulu. -I lost them all.
My agent. My friends. My boyfriends.
-Lulu? -Fritz.
-The supermodel. -I was so ashamed.
I knew it.
I knew she barfed.
-Oh, that documentary. -No, I mean I heard her.
You heard Lulu Fritz barfing?
Yeah, couple times. Nasty.
You think I'm gonna need a sweater in Detroit? In May?
What?
You don't feel compelled to explain further?
We dated. A little. I told you that, didn't I?
Let me think. No.
Thought I did. Are you gonna be cool staying here by yourself?
-You'll walk Bob? -Sure.
Don't let him walk you. Who's the boss?
-Me. -Tell him that.
-I'm the boss, Bob. -You hear that, Bob?
-You never mentioned her. -Who?
Lulu.
Because we don't sit around talking about past relationships.
She was a relationship.
-Come on, Stace. -Yeah, we do.
You told me about that med student you dated right before me.
And then the girl before that. What's her name? Joyce.
-I guess you just forgot to mention-- -This is why I hate talking about this.
It's just, you end up fighting over old ghosts.
It's history. It's over. The past is past.
That's before the past was a supermodel that barfed quietly.
You know, I don't pry into your old boyfriends.
Here's a little tip: I never dated Brad Pitt.
All right. Shut it off, okay?
Look, I've had really bad experiences...
...talking about past relationships, no matter how casual.
If you have to know, we had problems in bed.
Hallelujah
-Okay? -Okay.
-Bob hates it when we fight. -We're not fighting.
-Tell him. -We are not fighting, Bob.
So no more Lulu Fritz?
I will never mention the name "Lulu Fritz" again.
-Lulu Fritz. -No.
-And he never told you? -The past is past.
-"Unnatural Animal Love" in five. -Tell me you're not quoting him.
We made an agreement not to discuss old relationships.
-Renegotiate. -No.
Those who do not learn from his history are condemned to repeat it.
Doesn't matter who he dated. What matters is why he stopped.
-What's he do? -He works for the Devils.
-Who doesn't? Kidding. -Think about it hypothetically.
Say Derek's like Neil. Hypothetically.
How do you find out before you're too far gone? He won't say:
"I was screwing my way through the phone book."
-"And I only got to K." -He'll say:
-"The past is past." -Right.
-Your man's hiding something. -What about his family?
-Good point. They'll always give dirt. -No, that's not what I mean.
What are they like? You can tell a lot by studying where he came from.
I haven't met them.
He doesn't bring girls home.
-He just doesn't. -Can I ask...
...you ever think of appealing this decision? Meeting the folks?
I don't wanna make him feel uncomfortable.
Yeah. Let's not do that. That'd be bad.
-Stop it! -What century are you in?
You have a right-- Nay, an obligation to find out more.
He's away for, what, two weeks? Take that time, I beg you.
Learn a few things. Anything. Information's power.
-Feels dishonest. -That's because it is.
You wanna keep your man, you find out why they didn't.
-I thought you stopped. -I have.
Look, I agree. There's better ways to do it.
-It'd be great if you could ask him-- -Or the folks.
Since no one argues with the lord and master, you gotta get creative.
All men should come with letters of recommendation, or warning labels.
Or little black books. Does he have one?
-A Palm. Why? -She may be hopeless.
-She's not hopeless. -Okay, then open it up. Explore.
Speaking of which, what was Lulu's last name?
Fritz. Why?
-What's that? -Vintage. Working Girl, 1988.
-Good movie? -It's a great movie.
You've never seen it?
Staten Island girl trying to make her way in the big city... -...on her own terms. -Melanie Griffith, huh?
-...on her own terms. -Melanie Griffith, huh? -Yeah. -Has she never heard of call waiting?
-Yeah. -Has she never heard of call waiting?
And Mike Nichols. He's famous.
He's a genius.
Plus, he's married to Diane Sawyer.
-Who you wanna be. -Ringing!
Ladies.
I don't wanna be her, Barb. I wanna work with her.
I will work with her. I believe I will.
-I believe you will too. -Hello, Lulu Fritz?
Ira Nachlis. Senior associate producer/producer, Kippie Kann Do.
Listen, "I Model, Then I Barf Quietly"...
-...is one of our highest-rated shows. -What are you doing?
I am trying to give a young innocent her 15 minutes of fame. Now--
I'm sorry. Lulu...
...we're thinking of having a special next month.
We'd like you to come in tomorrow for an interview.
Excellent. We'll do lunch and throw up-- Catch up.
I would love to expose myself to your viewers.
Okay. Not going there.
So how did the documentary affect your personal life, Lulu?
Well, it forced Stephen, my ex, to face his truth.
He barfed too.
Fascinating. And before Stephen?
I didn't date much. I was shy.
And ugly.
Why do supermodels say how ugly they were when they were young?
Is it because they want us to know they suffered?
Do they think that it makes them more deserving?
That we'll forgive them their bounty? Note to supermodels:
None of us believe you.
-No one invited me to the prom. -Makes you stronger.
So the only relationship you ever had ever was Stephen?
No. I mean, I dated a few people.
-Names, please. -Fabrizio. Renato.
Carmine. Jahni.
-Derek. -She said his name.
Derek.
His name came out of that mouth.
Derek. Derek.
Her "Derek" was my Derek.
-But mostly I was lonely. -How sad.
-Tell me about one of the early guys. -Oh, say, Derek.
-Derek? -It was just a casual kind of thing.
-Stace, let her tell the story. -I am. She is. Go ahead.
I was so young. I can hardly remember.
-Happens to all of us. -It was all superficial.
-What isn't these days? -Completely about sex.
-Completely about-- What? -Sex.
-Sex. -Sex.
-But you had problems in bed? -You don't know that.
Guessing! Someone needs to chill.
Actually, the bedroom...
...was the only place we really connected.
Two, sometimes three times a day.
Funny how your memory just snapped back like that.
Anyways, Derek and I didn't talk much. I just used him for--
-We know. -Pretty amazing.
Experimental. Wild.
-Sounds great. Why'd you split? -Oh, same old, same old.
Schedules. Travel. Temptation.
-He cheated. -No! I did. All the time.
But he stuck around like a lovesick puppy.
Finally, I asked him to go back to his old girlfriend.
She called all the time, begging him, pleading.
-She was desperate. -Joyce?
-How'd you know her name? -You mentioned it. She mentioned it.
-You did. -I did?
Yeah.
Well, Joyce.
He only went back to her out of pity.
I wonder what he's doing now.
Hey, Derek. This is Lulu!
Just thought I'd give you a call and let you know I was in town.
Cow. Quietly barfing cow.
And suddenly, my certain world didn't seem so certain after all.
Hi, Bob. Are you hungry? I'm not hungry.
Lulu dangled before me like bait on a wire.
I swallowed it whole...
...and then wanted more.
It was time for the past to meet the present.
Bob, look. A box.
I just need to clean up some stuff.
He told me to.
Just checking things out, you know?
Oh, look. Pictures.
So this is hysterical Joyce.
You don't look so desperate.
You look athletic.
And pretty. Where was this taken?
New York City Marathon. Okay.
Where you crossed the finish line.
And you were crying.
And so was Derek while he hugs you.
There's so many neat pictures, Bob.
Rachel Keyes.
You are a podiatrist, I think?
What's with that little minx-like smile?
What?
Can you just not look at me like that, please?
It's making me very uncomfortable.
There. See? I'm done. Okay?
And don't judge me. Okay, Bob?
Hey, Stacy, it's me. You there?
Okay, I guess you're out with Bob. Listen, I left my Palm at home.
I need you to go through it and get me some numbers. Take care.
Palm?
Did you hear that, Bob? Derek left his Palm at home.
Guess we'll have to look for it.
If I were a Palm, where would I be?
If we were Palms, where would we be, Bob?
Where is it?
Where could it be right now?
He asked for it.
Where could it be?
Luck is when preparation meets opportunity.
Okay, Bob?
Life's about certainty. It's about being in control.
Password, password, password. What would his password be?
Thank you.
What?
Go to your bed.
Go to your bed, Bob!
Seconds before opening the metallic case...
...I envisioned all the evil flowing into the world.
I was Pandora.
And then I got over it.
Look at that. Joyce works at the Kaleidoscope Kitchen.
Brand-new place. Know what that means?
It's a new entry. That place has only been open two, three months.
How would he know that unless they still talk?
-That's ridiculous. -Ladies.
Hey! We could give her a little jingle.
-"Hello, Joyce... -Where's Leo? Where's Leo?
...Moore? We're doing research on an upcoming episode...
...'Best Chefs in the Tri-State Area.'
No guarantees, of course, but I was wondering if we could...
...spend a little time...
-...getting to know each other better." -Not doing it.
Now, how about that doctor he dated? What was her name?
-Barb. -You have to admit it's educational.
Look what you learned with Lulu. He didn't cheat.
-I never thought he did. -He said they had problems in bed...
...and it turns out the problem was getting out.
Little lie. Harmless. Unless it's a pattern.
-It's not a pattern. -How do you know?
Say, hypothetically, you get a dog.
-A what? -A dog, hypothetically.
And you find out his grandfather and father chased cars.
-Whose father? -The dog's. In fact...
...all the males in his line, car-chasers.
Chances are he'll chase cars.
Helpful information you can only get by doing research.
You need to find out, is your man a car-chaser?
-No. -Are you sure?
People are creatures of habit. Last one. Their behavior is patterned.
After Neil slept with half of Newark, I found out he'd been doing it for years.
So keep yourself dumb and believe what he tells you, or.... Up to you.
-God, I hate this. -I know.
-I hate doubt. -You'll get over it.
Now, what was the name of that chiropractor?
Podiatrist. Dr. Rachel Keyes.
Barb?
Yeah?
Look, make an appointment. That's all. See how you feel once you meet her.
If you don't do the whole Kippie spiel, at least your feet will be happy.
You wanna work with Diane Sawyer?
You gotta learn how to do research.
In the field.
Health and Wellness Women's Clinic. Hold, please.
Look under the hood before you purchase the car.
Thank you for holding. Health and Wellness Women's Clinic.
Yes, I'd like to make an appointment with Dr. Keyes, please.
-She's booked through the month. -Okay.
-No cancellations? -Oh, wait.
We have one for Thursday morning. 8:45.
-I'll take it. -Name?
Barb Campbell-hyphen-Dunn.
And what is this regarding, please?
-Warts. Plantar warts. Hurt like hell. -See you Thursday.
Hey, don't let the chickens out!
I was strangely calm waiting to meet the woman Derek dated before me.
So calm, in fact, I never questioned the gown...
...or the need for easy access.
-So when was your last period? -My what?
-Your menses. -I don't understand.
Okay, each month you might notice a change in your body--
I understand what you mean.
I just don't know why you'd want to know--
-Barbara Campbell? -Hyphen-Dunn.
-Yes. -I'm Dr. Keyes.
-Hi. -Hi.
So, what brings you in here today?
-Warts. -Warts.
-Really painful. -All the time?
Well, mostly when you step on them.
Heels, you know. Ouch.
I have a bit of a shoe fetish. Stilettos.
I'm trying to stay away from them. It's my bad.
Well, maybe you can be more specific as to where the warts are.
-You wanna use this mirror? -No, that's not necessary.
I'm very flexible. They're sort of deep down.
Just look way deep down inside.
You can't really see them unless you look inside.
Well, maybe not that way. Why don't you just relax, Barbara.
-Okay. -That's a good girl. There you go.
Just going to put your feet in these stirrups.
Stirrups?
Gynecologist? Not a podiatrist? Ten-to-1 those aren't for the opera.
-And we'll have a little look-see. -Look-see? Where?
Oops. Someone left their panties on.
-Oops. -Just....
There you go. Good girl.
Good.
-Comfy? -Well, let's see.
I'm spread-eagle for my boyfriend's ex, who's about to go searching for warts.
Super. Thanks.
Barbara, you know what they say, right?
You can never be too rich, too thin, or too far down on the table.
So let's scooch you. There we go. Perfect.
-I'm going to insert the speculum now. -Oh, good. Narration.
You may feel a bit of pressure.
Would you take a look at that cervix, Nurse Kisilevsky?
Textbook. I'm not the first person who's told you that, I'm sure.
Can't hear it enough.
It was all too horrible. I had to avert my eyes.
Which made me focus on a sight more horrific.
Midst what seemed like an unusual amount of Dr. Keyes' beauty shots...
...stood a picture that jumped out. Big. Dr. Rachel Keyes and Bob?
Stinky Bob! Why would she have a picture with him unless he was hers?
Worse, theirs. I needed to take control. Fast!
Dr. Keyes, I work with the Kippie Kann show.
You would never be interested in being on television would you?
Call me Rachel.
I started the vitamin company about a year and a half ago. It's just taken off.
-Oh? And look. Your picture's on it. -I fought them on that.
Sure you did. So tell me, Rachel.
What did you have to sacrifice to get here?
Relationships? Family? Pets?
I never wanted to settle in order to settle down.
-You know what I'm talking about. -Oh, yeah. Back to pets.
I noticed a picture of a dog in the examination room.
-So happy-looking. -Bob.
He's my ex's dog, but I raised him.
-He was such a cuddler. -Your ex?
The dog. I could've lobbied to keep him when we split.
But med school by day, the book by night.
-You wrote a book? -Here we go. Second printing.
Take one. I'll just bill you for it. It's a play on words.
"Keyes to Your Vagina."
Clever. Oh, and there's that picture again.
-So anyways, Bob, is it? -Yeah, he's with Derek. My ex.
But I have visitation rights.
-Oh, really? -Sure.
The photograph in the exam room was taken a few weeks ago at a picnic.
A picnic? A few weeks ago?
He went on a picnic with this self-obsessed prodigy?
-My head was spinning. -Anyway, Barb. Good news.
Your warts have cleared up.
That's good to know.
Welcome back to "Grandma's a Hooker, So Handle It."
Tell me, Grandma, as a working girl....
-Stand by, mystery guest. -Standing by.
I pull down about five grand a weekend.
Ten if I bring a friend.
What do you say, Kippie?
What? Me?
-Talent is in place and ready to go. -Hey. How'd it go?
-I went to third base with his ex. -What?
But my warts have cleared up. She was a gynecologist!
-Doorbell. -Gyne--
-Mommy, no! -Oh, shut up!
Ira. Can you...?
A gynecologist? Yikes.
"Yikes" does not even begin to describe what I experienced.
-Here she is. Don't screw up. -Turkey sausage.
She's an absolute freak of nature. She's got to be, like, what, 26, 27?
She's publishing books. She's practicing medicine.
And there's like a zillion pictures of her in her office.
-Just her. Alone. -Yeah.
And let's not forget the little vitamin company that's just taken off.
-Look at the positive side. -Which is?
He's attracted to extraordinary women. Beautiful. Talented.
Which is why he's with you now.
The only salient information you need to know is, did he cheat?
What? No. She was more in love with herself.
-This is good news. -Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just that he saw her a few weeks ago.
They picnicked, which is totally fine.
He's completely free to picnic with whomever.
-But why wouldn't he mention it? -Maybe....
-He forgot? -Maybe.
-Yeah. Okay. -Who put those damn K's...
...all over the cue cards?
Bob, slow down. You're rocking the Palm.
-You are so busted. -What?
You're out with a guy. Two-foot-six. Loves the lips. Farts a lot.
-You giving him a nice walk? -Oh, well, actually...
-...he's giving me one. -Honey, don't let him do that.
Oh! Course not! No!
-I feel like we haven't spoken all week. -I feel like we haven't spoken ever.
Bob, slow down.
I've been kind of busy here, you know?
Bob. Bob. Bob! Bob!
No! We don't live here, Bob!
Come on! No!
Keyes.
Keyes? As in "Keyes to Your Vagina," Bob?
-Traitor. -Stace? What's going on?
-Who you talking to? -Honey, you're not gonna believe this.
You wanna hear something funny?
Bob just dragged me up the steps of a brownstone...
-...a few blocks away from you. -Who's the boss?
On Malverne.
You think he has a friend in the neighborhood?
Dark-haired genius, about 5'4"?
Stace, he's a dog. Okay?
If you let him, he'll walk all over you.
Wonder where he learned it. Oh! Honey, I'm sorry.
I've gotta go. Okay, call you from a hard line.
-Excuse me! -Sorry.
-Hello? -Who is it?
-Hello? -Who's there?
Hello? Bob?
-Bob? -Oh, come on, man.
-You recognize his bark? -Stay! Sit.
-And he did. -I'm coming down.
Bob, come on.
Come on. Down here. Down here.
I need you to be very, very quiet.
Bob?
As I squatted, holding the snout of a dog in love with another woman...
...I sadly realized I had reached an all-time low.
Bob! Oh, come here, sweetheart! You little pie!
What are you doing out there?
Where's your daddy? Let's go call Daddy. Come on, little pumpkin head.
I ran out on my mani. Where is he?
In there. With her.
Number two.
-Yes? -Hi, it's Stacy Holt.
-Don't use my name! -Holtenfrau. The dog-walker.
-I'm here for Steve. -Bob!
-Bob! -Come on up. Number two.
Did she have pictures of herself in there?
-She was very nice. -Thanks. That makes me feel better.
-It's vibrating. -Really?
What are you doing?
-Give me a few minutes. -Oh, stop that.
This little guy could make me very happy.
Now you're officially scaring me.
-If it turns into a pizza, I'm getting one. -Take that thing out of your pants.
Oh, wow. So Joyce has freckles, huh?
-All over. -What?
And she's not self-conscious.
So many women hide their bodies these days, but not her.
-How did you get that? -You know...
...that little camera thing came on against my--
And she-- You know, there she is. Jackpot.
-Look at that arrow. Should I press it? -No.
-Why not? -Okay. Yes.
-Oh, my God. -There's so many.
I'm not doing this. I can't. It's like going through someone's drawers.
Hey, Stace? Would you wear a thong in front of your boyfriend's parents?
-Repeatedly? -My boyfriend's parents?
"Mom, Dad, Joyce. Hawaii, '99"?
He doesn't bring girls home, huh?
Oh, look. Christmas, '98. They went to Aspen.
I can't believe this.
He could have a sister named Joyce, who he French kisses.
And licks.
Dare you to press the next arrow.
-Shit. -How bad?
-Shit! -Pornographic?
It's out of power.
-Where are we going? -Gonna put this baby in a cradle.
-Come on. -Okay.
Hurry up, Bob!
I'll be right back.
All systems go!
Okay!
I know.
Because you can.
Would I like to sync? Kinky.
Entertainment. Absolument.
Here's the thing-- No.
-No. You'll thank me. -I know.
Jesus.
Wow. Presenting Joyce Moore and her cheesy music.
Make it stop. Barbara....
-Trying. Trying. -Please make it stop.
Oh, great. Now it's frozen.
-Hey, if you can do better.... -Later.
Listen. Here's the thing.
If you're happy with what you know...
...do you deserve explanation about what you don't?
I mean, hypothetically, you are in this great relationship with Neil.
-That's his name, right? -It wasn't a good relationship with Neil.
Hypothetically. You get married. You have kids.
You're totally and completely fulfilled. Then Neil dies.
-Where's that dial tone coming from? -I don't know. Does he die tragically?
Okay. Then you find out he cheated. That he had this whole other life.
Now, does that detract from what you two had together?
-Does it make it all a lie? -Yes.
-Why? -Because omissions are betrayals.
-Omissions are.... -Betrayals. They are betrayals.
-Is that your cell? -Mine whistles.
Hey, there. It's Joyce Moore. Do the deed after the beep.
What? The computer called Joyce?
-What did you do? -Nothing! I was standing over here.
Hey, you got Derek's machine. You know what to do and when to do it.
Derek, you there? It's Joyce. My caller ID said you just phoned.
Why did you hang up? I've been waiting for you to call since last week.
-What? -Okay. Give me a holler.
If I'm not home, try my cell. By the way, everyone loved your joke. Bye.
His joke?
What joke?
Derek doesn't joke. Nobody thinks he's funny.
He's not funny. What does this mean?
I think it means she's not history.
Is it always like this here?
Hey, you got Derek's machine. You know what to do and when to do it.
It's Derek. He's checking the messages. He's going to hear Joyce.
-Erase it! Smash it! Do something! -How? What am I going to do?
Kill it. Okay. Okay!
Derek--
-Good! There! -Yeah!
What?
I've just smashed an answering machine with a hockey stick.
Damn proud of you!
There were numbers on that machine that he needed, and I....
I've just smashed it. I smashed the hell out of it.
God's punishing me.
I hear you, God. You can stop now.
What has happened to me?
-You've discovered truth. -I've discovered a whole other reality.
They all talk. Dr. Keyes and Derek. Joyce and Derek?
Maybe they all talk to each other. Maybe it's just me they don't talk to.
Bottom line is, he's withheld.
-I'm gonna find out what's going on. -Good!
-Why she was waiting for his call. -Good question.
-If he still sees her, why don't I know? -Better question.
And if he has nothing to hide, why hide these old relationships?
-Want me to write these down for you? -So I guess I need to know...
...what I don't know.
I just need to.
Hi. Joyce Moore?
I'm sorry to call so late.
This is Barb Campbell-hyphen-Dunn from the Kippie Kann show.
We're doing a segment on chefs and we'd love to talk to you.
No, I'm not kidding.
Okay. So I'll call tomorrow, and we'll set something up.
I'd love to talk to you. Bye-bye.
-I'll have a double espresso latte-- -Sorry. No.
-What? -I live in a basement apartment...
...on Malverne. You were hiding in my doorway last night, smothering a dog.
I was not smothering him. It's a little game we play.
Double espresso, please.
You already scare people.
-More caffeine will make you a freak. -Are you trying to upset me?
If I do, you gonna hold my snout?
I'll get the latte and you get a chai iced tea.
-We'll switch after. -Thanks.
I heard that.
Joyce. Hi.
Hi. You're Barb. How did you know it was me?
Lucky guess.
I'll be watching.
You're a jokester. Yeah.
We have this little thing.
So I've heard amazing things about you, about the Kaleidoscope.
-From? -People! Who've been there.
Who know your work. You have a fan base.
-I'm only on two nights a week. -Quality, not quantity.
Yes. So tell me about the show.
I haven't watched much, but doesn't Kippie Kann do more of the...
-..."My Wife Slept With My Sister"--? -"And My Dad."
No, we're trying to revamp the show right now.
So I pitched this idea, which is this cook-off.
This is its research stage, where I pretend that I'm Diane Sawyer...
...asking brilliant questions while looking chic.
That's funny. You know, she was in the restaurant last week.
Do you want your latte?
-No. Who was? -Diane Sawyer.
She was here? In Jersey?
Yeah. The night manager knows her field producer...
...so they all came in for this big dinner. She's really nice.
She is?
I've wanted to meet her my whole entire life.
Then you will. I believe in destiny, don't you?
I do.
Excuse me. Coming. Coming. Coming.
-Hey. -Kipp!
-I'm just in the middle of an interview. -Okay, yeah, I'm sorry.
Listen, real quick then.
My machine at home is screwed up. I need numbers.
-Do you know where my Palm is? -Yep.
That's great. Okay, I need to get--
Could you look up Rafalsky....
-Stace? -Yeah, yeah.
Can I borrow a pen and a piece of--? Thank you.
-Thanks. -Rafalsky.
-Rafalsky. -And Langenbrunner.
And Langenbrunner.
-Is that it? -That's it.
-I love you. -I love you!
-You too, Kipp. -Oh, hey, listen.
Before I forget, the password is "Bob."
-Gotcha. -All right. Bye.
-Okay, then. -Can I ask you something...
...totally none of my business? Were you just talking to Kippie Kann...
...about Jamie Langenbrunner and Brian Rafalsky?
-You know them? -I wish.
I am the biggest hockey nut this side of Newark.
We're trying to book them on the show.
We're doing a whole recruiting segment. I'm their hockey gal.
You should meet my ex. He's a scout for the Devils. Give me your Palm.
-It's frozen. -I can fix it.
No, that's so sweet, but thank you.
Okay, well, why don't you just hold down the power button.
Go ahead.
Power button?
And you should hear a....
-And, fingers crossed... -Fingers crossed.
...it will reset.
Okay.
I cannot believe it.
-I can explain. -You have I Spy.
That's a brand-new program. Do you mind?
-Having I Spy? No, I don't mind. -Do you mind beaming it to me?
Here, I can-- You want me to show you there? Just take this.
And...
-...voilà! -Voilà what?
-Voilà, now I've got it. -But it's his-- Mine.
-I want it back. Please? -No. We both have it.
You have one, and I have its twin.
-You've never done it before. -Virgin. Damn proud of it.
You're funny.
So I work next Wednesday. Why don't you come by for dinner?
I will wow you with my chicken paillard.
How could I refuse? She had an ease, an openness...
...and the answers. She had the answers.
Party!
Kippie! Watch it, here! Watch it!
-Cut it! Phil, cut it! -Cut it. Reset.
Oh, God, she's coming up. She's coming up.
-Count to 10. -Katie!
-Take it easy. -Okay!
She's coming!
-Seven, eight, nine.... -Carl!
What? You were fantastic.
-That was very emotional. Phil? -Yeah. I teared up.
Trust me. No one does midgets like Kippie. Like you.
But everyone does them! Don't you get it?
-I want something fresh, original-- -It was his idea.
-Ira? -Now she remembers my name.
Get the midgets out of here.
Here comes the numbers speech.
Can you be midget-wrangler today?
My numbers go up, your numbers go up.
My success is your success.
Jerry Maguire.
Help Kippie help you!
That was very moving. I think we should all take a moment to--
-Places! Miserable midgets. -Moment's up!
-Places! Stand by, intro. -We're back in one.
-We are just about ready. -Phil, we're reset.
Okay, stand by, Kippie.
"Kippie's Kute Kouplings Kontinues."
Bob, I want you to move in really tight.
Tighter, tighter, tighter, till I tell you to stop.
Yeah. Right there.
We have a collection of cute couples to clear things up. I can't believe this.
What are you so worried about?
Do you think my idea is good?
-I mean, enough? -For the live show? Absolutely.
I'm convinced they're going to give it to you.
-Why? What do you know? -Not much. It's just, after staff--
-When? -Monday.
-Today's the big day! -I know!
-Go on. -I overheard them.
Pardon me? Who, who?
-Barb, Carl, Kippie. -Kippie? Kippie? Kippie's there?
-Yes. -Continue.
Well, they thought your "Little Black Book" idea was great.
They're right. I mean, it's my time.
I put in the work. I'm next up for promotion.
-It only makes sense. -It only makes sense.
Little black books. Little black books. Little black books.
This season's live show will be...
..."Plastic Surgery Nightmares." Congratulations, Barb.
Our newest producer.
-Way to go, girl! -Good one.
Now, people. People, people!
Since we are live, I'm expecting everybody to pitch in, right?
Right. Now that's a wrap.
Too bad, Ira.
Sorry, Ira. Maybe next sweeps?
Sweet.
Naive, but sweet.
You wanna go to dinner?
Can't. I'm on the committee for the Kippie Kann Kan Drive...
...Kippie Kares for Kids Koalition. Catch you later.
-Is he okay? -He's trying to be.
How about you? Urban legend.
-You said APs never get the live show. -What do I know?
Come with me. I've got a surprise for you.
Carl, here she is.
Stacy, Kippie liked your idea too.
For the tri-state cook-off! So if you could ask--
-What's her name? -Joyce.
-If we could have it at the-- -Kaleidoscope Kitchen.
Oh, love the K's. And Kippie loves cook-offs...
...so you get those pre-interviews in. Barb, you co-pilot.
-Katie. -Carl.
-Was he saying--? Are you saying--? -Congratulations.
My first show!
I mean, it's not a done deal or anything, but--
At least I'll have something legitimate to offer Joyce.
This is perfect. It's perfect! Thank you.
-I'm sorry. -That's okay. It's fine. I'm smiling.
Now Joyce could bake her cake, and the audience could eat it too.
Get that out to table four. Make sure they still have wine.
Which somehow made me feel a little less like the lying scumbag that I was.
And voilà!
-And this is for dessert. -What?
What did you do?
Joyce.
-Open it! -"To Barb, I can't wait--
Love, Diane." I can't believe you!
The night manager got it for you. It's just a little thing.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
-Table 24 left this for you. -Thank you, Gordon.
-It's Pat Burns. -Head coach for the New Jersey Devils.
Right, I forgot. You're the hockey gal.
Oh, my God.
Tickets for the playoffs? You're beloved.
Come with me. They're for tomorrow night. I mean, if you can.
These are tickets for the Stanley Cup. You're a crazy girl.
Well, I don't know anyone else who likes hockey.
Except my little brother, and I'd rather go with you.
-And Derek will be there. -I'm-- Who?
My ex.
I told you about him. He works for the Devils.
We'll meet him after the game for a drink. It's a ritual.
Oh, really?
The beautiful people have arrived.
They come every Wednesday night to be seen.
I better call the manager and make sure the camera crew is cleared.
So we're on? Great. Call me. You have my number?
-Yep. -Okay, good.
Those are Manolos, you clumsy--
Joyce.
If I were you, I wouldn't finish that statement.
Stacy?
Lulu!
Get a shot of us. She produces the Kippie Kann show.
-Why is she calling you Stacy, Barb? -That's her name.
No, actually, my name is Barb.
The other woman you met's name is Stacy.
-No? -Yes.
-She was Barb. -No.
No-- What?
-Enjoy your meal. -Join us, Stacy-Barb?
Okay, Phillip. Bring your camera.
How do you know her?
-We did a show last year on bulimia. -Oh, why am I not surprised?
She does make you wanna throw up. Or at least me.
-Sorry, I don't really like her, I guess. -"I guess"?
She used to hang out with my brother, and I sort of took her under my wing...
...until she took Derek from under mine.
-He cheated on you with her? -No, we had split up.
But one day we're talking about getting married...
...and the next day we're dating other people.
Taking space.
God, I hate that expression, don't you?
Hate it. So then?
So then he starts talking to Lulu, who totally knows the score.
And then she advises me to see other people.
-Hideous. -And she meant nothing to him.
She was a fling. I mean, he wanted us to get back together.
But, in a way, we're just closer being friends.
You are? Good. You are.
We are, and if not, there's always the boomerangs.
-The boomerangs. -Yeah. You know the kind.
You throw them out there into the world....
-And they always come back to you. -Yeah, that's right.
He bought us each one, and we promised never to throw them away.
So no matter what happened, if we needed to, or wanted to...
-...then we could still end up.... -Together.
Anyway, whatever.
Why were we talking about this?
You know, he probably wouldn't even remember the story...
...never mind the boomerangs, and then there's me, the romantic sap...
...who still has hers framed in the bedroom.
How stupid is that?
Not stupid.
It's just a waste of energy.
There's so many other interesting guys out there for you.
Joyce, you're gonna meet the right person. Watch.
Or I could end up with Derek.
Wouldn't that be funny?
Right now I'm not rushing into anything or anyone.
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice....
-Shame on me. -Exactly.
Something about the way she believed she might get him back...
...made me believe it too.
Thanks, pal.
I'm home!
Hey, Bob. How you doing?
Come here, buddy. Come here. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
-Hey. -Hey. I heard you from downstairs.
-You did? -Yeah.
Yikes. Was I that loud?
No, you sounded great. Kind of sad, though. Everything okay?
Yeah. You know, work issues, but I'm fine.
-You're home early. -You say that like that's a bad thing.
No! No, no, no.
I just didn't expect you, that's all.
What happened to the other guy?
A mouse.
-A mouse did this? -Yeah.
There was a mouse, and, you know, Bob freaked...
-...and forget about it. -A mouse scared Bob?
Went crazy. You wouldn't believe it.
He chased him onto the answering machine...
...where the mouse just, like, taunted and taunted Bob.
So I ran and I got your stick, your hockey stick...
...and I just smashed it.
-You smashed a mouse? -Yeah.
No, like I would smash a mouse.
He got away, but I scared him good.
I don't think he'll be coming back.
-He carry my box down too? -That's very funny.
No, I did.
I was looking for another phone.
Which you found, in a closed box marked "personal stuff."
No offense, Derek, but you're not exactly Mr. Organized.
-You're a mess. -All right, all right.
Don't go criticizing homie. Homie just got home.
-Yo, I was defending your dog, yo. -Thank you.
Who gets very sad when you're away.
Very needy.
-Oh, yeah? -He missed you.
-He the only one? -No, Joyce missed you too.
So you wanna know why I'm home early?
I'm seeing Robbie Moore's parents tomorrow.
-That means you're close. -Bringing the contract.
-Wait, wait. Tomorrow's the playoffs. -Yeah.
-You're not gonna go? -No.
If I don't close this kid tomorrow, Terry's gonna sign him.
I can't miss the opportunity.
You know what? I'm doing this for both of us.
I'm sorry, Bob. All of us.
I felt like a lying sack of fertilizer.
Knowing what I knew and not knowing what I didn't...
...and knowing more than anything that I had to know more.
She called all the time, begging him, pleading, pathetic.
He played me the messages on the machine. They were hysterical.
She was desperate.
One angry chef, coming up.
I can't show her that.
I'd be purposely hurting a friend.
Knowledge is a terrible and a marvelous thing.
It just depends on your perspective.
Think of it this way.
If she knew who you really were, she'd hate you.
Can you blame her?
And, Stace?
She's not your friend.
Have fun at the game.
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. I was in the middle of a crisis with Derek.
I'm helping him with something.
Doesn't he have someone else to help, like a girlfriend?
Probably a bunch. But....
We agreed not to discuss anyone we date, unless one of us was serious.
Then we have to, but he's not, and I'm not.
So why torture each other? You know, it's just too painful for both of us.
Sorry, that's my cell.
Hello? Hey, I was just talking about you.
Derek.
So, what happened?
You might think it odd that I didn't strangle her...
...as I watched her flirt and coo with my man.
But I didn't.
I was strangely drawn to their banter.
Curious about this part of his life...
...that I had been completely dumb to just a few days earlier.
They had a past.
-They had a present separate from me. -They scored. Listen.
Can you hear?
She didn't know he had a girlfriend, but she didn't want to.
Suddenly, I knew what I had to do.
Finally I asked him to go back to his old girlfriend.
She called all the time, begging him, pleading.
-She was desperate. -Joyce?
-How'd you know her name? -You mentioned it.
-You did. -She did.
I did?
Well, yes. Joyce.
He only went back to her out of pity.
Barb was right.
As soon as Joyce realized that he'd lied to her about Lulu...
...she'd never forgive him.
Which was, after all, what I'd wanted.
So why did I feel so bad?
-I shouldn't have shown you that. -No, I appreciate it, really.
It's just so bad, you know.
I probably did call him a few times when he was with her.
But I was upset. I wouldn't characterize it as being hysterical or pathetic.
But for her to know...
...that I called means that he told her.
Even if she didn't hear it, she knew, and that's just so bad.
Joyce, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
-He's in there. -Where?
Right there, with the orange sweater and the stupid haircut.
It is stupid.
Yeah.
We stood there...
...both of us sadly in love with the same man.
Both of us feeling let down by him.
Where are you going?
I'm going home. I'll see you tomorrow for the pre-interview. Good night, Barb.
Wait, Joyce?
Wait. Please. Wait.
-That tape, the Lulu-- -You know what, it's not about the tape.
It's just...
...talking to you and seeing Lulu. All that stuff brought up bad memories.
And who am I trying to kid, you know?
A clean break is easier. You can reset it...
...and it heals, and you move on.
But if you leave things messy or things don't get put right...
...then it just hurts.
Forever.
It's really time for me to move away from him.
From all this.
I don't even know who he is anymore.
I should have felt happier at that moment.
I had won.
But the cost was high and the victory hollow.
I had taken a good friend from someone I loved.
And nothing about that felt right.
I needed a reality check. I needed Mom.
But she was out. So I settled for Carly.
The line between right and wrong had blurred.
In my search for truth, I had become the lie.
Perhaps some secrets should remain secret.
Okay, you guys are not that bright. Can I have an amen?
Is everything okay?
It's great. Yeah.
-That makes one of us. -What's the matter?
I'm not feeling so, you know, good.
You can't go home. I mean, I need you.
Today's my show. I'm a nervous wreck. We're live.
Oh, my God. I totally forgot. Of course I'll be here.
Wouldn't miss it for the world.
You are so beautiful, like a real producer.
Hello. Headset.
And there was something I needed to tell you. What was it?
-Oh, right. We're live. -There she is.
-Yikes. -Showtime.
Great to see you.
-Welcome to Kippie Kann Live. -Watch this ladder.
I need a running order.
-Who's on first? -You.
-What? -It's for you.
-What is? -Everything.
Let's see who's at Kippie's door.
Just go with it.
Stacy, oh, come on out.
That's right, Stacy. Make yourself comfortable.
You look a little confused.
-Know the name of today's show? -"Plastic Surgery Nightmares"?
No. Actually it's called "Little Black Book."
Let's fill our audience in on some recent history.
Stacy's a new member of our staff who's been using resources here...
...to do her own personal research...
...on her boyfriend, Derek.
And three of his ex-girlfriends.
-Oh, no. -Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
She went through his little black electronic book...
-...found his ex-girlfriends... -I don't believe this.
...and interviewed them under the guise of being a guest on our show.
-That's my idea. -Wow, man, too bad.
-Barb's upstairs, if you wanna kill her. -And they will be.
But not for the reasons they thought.
Take, for example, supermodel Lulu Fritz.
Welcome to Kippie Kann Live.
You used us. You took my idea, and you set her up.
-How can you just stand there? -Camera two.
-You stole my idea. -It's poetry.
-You stole it. -I'll share credit. Ira...
...there's a bigger thing happening. Just watch. God, are you watching?
It was all superficial. Completely about sex.
I'd have to say no. That's not from my documentary.
That's right, Lulu. It's all a ruse.
A flower?
-A ruse, a joke. This woman... -How can you do this?
...Stacy Holt, a member of our staff, got you here under false pretenses.
-Her name's Barbara. -No, the woman producing is Barbara.
The woman beside you is the current girlfriend of the man you once dated.
-Stephen? -Derek.
Camera five. Doorbell.
Another woman scorned, and she doesn't even know it yet.
Come in, Dr. Keyes.
Welcome to Kippie Kann Live.
Drama, pathos, life unfolding.
-It's good. -It's Greek. Go to three, Phil.
-Camera three, go. -Dr. Keyes, you're a gynecologist.
This woman posed as a patient...
...to obtain personal information on her boyfriend, whom you once dated.
But I examined her.
-Well, that was all a setup. -Even the warts?
No, it was a joke. There were none, ever.
Ah, the apex. Joyce. She thinks she's doing a pre-interview for a cook-off.
That's what you told her, right, Stace?
Come in, Joyce.
Welcome to Kippie Kann Live.
Here comes the tough part. You can do it.
Welcome.
What's with the audience and all these--?
-Lulu. -Oh, that's right.
You two go way back. But what about you two?
-Barb? -No, actually, that's Stacy.
-Derek's current girlfriend. -What?
No cook-off today.
You lied to me? After everything I told you, you lied.
-Just like she did. -Are you referring to me?
-Shut up. -What did you say?
Ladies, please. Let's fill the audience in, shall we?
We sent our own Kippie Kann crew to the Kaleidoscope Kitchen...
...posing as a crew for 48 Hours.
-Then that was all a rose, too? -Ruse, yeah. Roll it.
-Why is she calling you Stacy, Barb? -Because that's her name.
No, actually, my name is Barb.
The other woman you met's name was Stacy.
-No, she was Barb. -No.
-What? -Stimulating as ever.
I'd say it's nice to see you, but then I'd be lying.
Enjoy your meal.
I got sick that night, and not on purpose.
Stay put for more surprises when "Little Black Book" continues.
Ladies, stay in your seat, okay. We're still live.
-I'm sorry-- -Don't-- Don't say another word.
You wanted me to hate him? Mission accomplished. I do.
But, as bad as he is, he is still too good for you.
-If you could have a seat-- -This is completely unacceptable.
I'll sue this entire show for defamation of character.
This is America, and you are welcome to sue anyone.
But that release you signed is ironclad.
I was told we'd be discussing sexually transmitted diseases.
Sexually transmitted diseases. That's an idea.
-Ninety seconds to air. -Ninety seconds.
-I love it live. -You stoop to conquer.
Yeah. I stoop. We all do.
I mean, look at where we work.
We march thousands of Stacys through here every year.
We uncover their secrets. We spare no feelings.
But suddenly you get a conscience because you know one personally.
-You're unethical. -You're a hypocrite.
-I'm a hypocrite? -This show is based on hypocrisy.
You wanna call me unethical? Okay.
But don't judge me and then worship Kippie for doing the same thing.
We're all swimming in the same cesspool.
We work in reality TV, Ira. This is reality.
Forty-five seconds to air, Phil.
-Ira. -Underneath your seats...
...there's a Kippie Kann Live hat for each one of you. Kippie's a giver.
-I gotta get to the control room. -Carl, you wanna handle this?
-Got it covered here. Thanks. -You're all in on this?
-Everyone knew? -There is no conspiracy here.
Just a good idea for sweeps.
-You can fight it. Seems pointless. -Lame. Really stupid.
Or you could become a part of something bigger.
Something completely different. Now, of course I cannot--
But trust me, gonna be big.
-Huge, it's giant. -I'm talking about a real show here.
Changing formats. Breaking the fourth wall, and the fifth.
Kamikaze television without restriction...
...without hesitation, without Kippie.
It's a pretty exciting time to be on the ground floor.
Thanks, Carl. But being that low doesn't interest me.
Don't fool yourself. What you did was lower than anything I've ever done.
By the way, if you leave now, I will sue you for fraud.
Oh, come on.
It's your 15 minutes. It's not so bad.
-It's my life. -It'll be over soon.
I meant the show.
Five, four, three, two....
Welcome back to Kippie Kann Live.
And "Little Black Book."
I think it's time to bring out the man of the hour. What do you say?
Are you ready for Derek?
Derek! Derek!
Roll scream, roll doorbell.
Derek, come on out.
What the--?
Derek thought he was coming to a surprise promotion party for Stacy.
You're in for it now!
Lulu? Rach-- Joyce.
What the hell's going on? What are you doing here?
-You can do it. -You wanna tell him, Stace, or shall I?
Yes.
I wanna tell him. I'll do it.
God.
What's going on?
-Tell him! -They're all here because of me.
They're all here because of me.
See, after I heard about you and Lulu...
-...I interviewed her. -You did what?
You know, look under the hood first, she's Lulu Fritz.
Thank you.
-We got around to the sex question-- -Wait a minute. You're not serious.
She said that you guys did it, like, two, three times a day.
It's funny. I mean, why would she lie like that?
-What are you doing? -Purging. You can go next.
Then I went to Rachel. I wanted to go straight to Joyce, but I couldn't.
Not right away, so I made up this story about warts...
...and went to Rachel, who I thought was a podiatrist...
...but it turns out, joke's on me.
You can shut the cameras off, because it's never gonna air.
We're live in 70 markets.
Hi, Mom.
Then Barb and I browsed through your Palm.
-Barb who? -Barbara Campbell-hyphen-Dunn.
Who sold me out for this show.
Just like Carl's selling Kippie out.
At least, isn't that what you told me?
Yes, yes, that's it. Turn the tables on us all. That's real. It's honest.
Phillip, get Carl.
Jay, give me a shot to Carl.
-What are you doing? -Regurgitating.
Something sexy just for you, Carl.
-Who's Carl? -Stage left, crooked toupee.
-Phillip, on four. -Camera four, go.
Get that camera off of me. Phil?
-Can't do this to him. -You hold that shot. Split the screen.
Did you know that Carl comes in really close...
...so that America can see that tape you wear on your face right there?
Then he edits it out of the copy he gives you.
-Back to Carl now. -And those tabloid leaks.
Nice, really nice.
You're burying Carl.
I'm burying him, her, you, me.
We're all going down.
Go to commercial.
No commercial. I'm still running things. Stay with me, Phil.
Not you. You'll get promoted.
I'm out of here. I can't top this.
Anyway, Barb and I were playing with your Palm, and we stumbled...
...across a lovely montage of Joyce...
...and your folks on holiday.
Which is really odd, because you never bring girls home.
-I don't. -You brought her.
She's different.
Why?
-Yeah, why? -Tell us!
You know what? I'm not doing this.
-Why? -You wanna get out of my way?
Is she better for you?
I guess so.
Maybe I always knew it.
Maybe that's why I had to meet her...
...and when I did, I understood, because I liked her too.
I liked you so much. I want you to know that.
Not in a weird kind of way, but in a way that I thought...
...maybe in some alternate universe we could be friends.
Yesterday, you told me you were schmoozing up some new recruit...
...and you're schmoozing Joyce?
No, Joyce's brother.
Robbie Moore, the recruit, is Joyce's brother.
Joyce hooked us up because she's trying to help me out.
Then why wouldn't you have told me that straight up?
-I mean, why lie? -I never lied to you!
-"Omission is betrayal." -Yes.
Oh, okay. Now you're gonna tell me about betrayal?
What the hell do you call this?
I would never do this to you, ever.
No?
Then answer me this.
If we shared our lives together...
...why didn't we share our lives?
You shouldn't have to tell me everything, Derek.
But why wouldn't you want to?
Unless there's somebody else you're waiting for.
Someone who isn't afraid to say, "The past isn't past, Derek."
Or, "I really wanna meet your folks."
Or, "I really, really hate hockey."
-You do? -Oh, to the bottom of the ninth.
-That's baseball. -You see that?
I was just too afraid to be honest with you, with myself, because....
If I was really honest...
...gut-wrenching honest...
...then I'd have to admit...
...that we weren't right the way you guys are.
Were we?
There's your show, Kippie.
"My Boyfriend Belongs With His Ex...
...and I Just Figured It Out."
Sue me, Carl.
Listen.
I'm fully aware that you may never speak to me again.
And I understand. I do.
But before you leave, I want you to know that this whole idea...
...wasn't planned out. It wasn't premeditated.
It presented itself, and then I guided it into this...
...event. Now, granted, it was dramatic. It was extreme...
...but you dove head-on into the muck and came out...
...with this masterpiece.
And I hope one day you can understand...
...that you got what you wanted, Stace:
Your life back.
I should tear your eyes out right now.
But how will you ever be able to look at yourself in the morning?
Looks like we have an audience.
Stay put. Kippie Kann Live and "Little Black Book"...
...will be back after these words.
Move it, will you?
The question: How does a girl who jumps into a rabbit hole...
...plummeting into chaos, come out unchanged?
The answer:
She doesn't.
No, it can't be closed now.
Stacy?
Stacy Holt. It's Bean.
-King. Bean King from college. -Bean.
Bean, what are you doing here?
Inventory. We just finished.
Bean There's yours? The coffee place?
I come here all the time. Of course it's yours.
Wow, this all makes sense in some cosmic way.
I get it. I get it.
This must sound crazy to you.
It's just--
I have spent a lifetime preparing for a lifetime.
And I was beginning to think it all went wrong somehow.
But maybe you're the reason, Bean.
-For? -Everything.
Maybe you're the plan I was supposed to hang on to.
Bean?
The 8:00 was sold out. Should I try the 10:20?
Yeah, sure, honey. I'll be right there.
That's my wife, Colleen.
You should come meet her.
Love to, but I just gotta go jump in the river now.
Hey, come on, now.
Every plan I had for my life went so unbelievably wrong.
John Lennon said, "Life happens when you're busy making other plans."
-Then he got shot. -Right.
You just gotta live. Stop planning your moves.
Let them happen. I mean, you might be surprised.
Do you believe in happy endings, Bean?
Yeah, I think so.
How about you?
I do.
Isn't that funny?
I still do with all my heart.
Even when the girl doesn't get the guy in the end.
Or, in my case, both guys.
-That's amazing. Congratulations. -Thanks.
You go find your happy ending, Stacy Holt.
And thanks for the continuing patronage.
By fall, I was ready to try again.
A little bruised. A little humbled.
And, hopefully, a little smarter.
I believe we write our own stories.
And each time we think we know the end...
...we don't.
Perhaps luck exists somewhere between...
...the world of planning, the world of chance...
...and in the peace that comes from knowing...
...that you just can't know it all.
You know, life's funny that way.
Once you let go of the wheel, you might end up...
...right where you belong.
Wow, that is such an amazing story.
I mean, you went through all of that, and here you are.
I can do this job, Jane.
I've been preparing my whole life.
It's too bad Diane's gone.
She is?
On assignment. She'll be back next week.
But before she left...
...she told me, "If you find someone great for this job...
...I mean, perfect...
...don't let them go."
Welcome aboard, Stacy.
You mean...
-...I got the job? -You got the job.
Congratulations.
Stay here. I'll go check Diane's calendar.
Thank you.
-Hello, Mama? I got the job. -You got the job?
-You got the job! She got the job! -I got the job! I got the job!
-She got the job! -It's amazing, amazing, amazing.
-I knew it. -What could be better than this?
Mama, what could be better?
Are you Jane?
I'm Carly Simon. I'm here for the pre-tape.
Jane, Jane, Jane.
-Are you okay? Are you okay? -Hello? Stacy?
Honey? Honey, are you there?
Hello? Hi, I've just come into the studio, and I think your friend fainted.
She fainted? Oh, my God. Who is this?
My name is Carly Simon. I'm just here to meet with Jane.
Oh, I think she's coming around again, so I'll give her the phone.
Hello? Mama?
Gone. Are you really Carly Simon?
-Yeah, I just-- -I can't believe this.
-You just really made my life. -Are you Jane?
-My name is Stacy Holt. -Stacy.
I just got a job here. Please don't tell Diane that I fainted.
-You really are Carly Simon. -You're okay?
This is the most-- Yes, thank you. I'm so mortified.
I hug people when I'm embarrassed.
So do I. I do exactly the same thing.
I think this is just about the greatest day of my life.
Every, every day, our Lord is testing us.
If he wasn't testing us, how would you account
for the sorry state of our society,
for the crimes that plague the big cities of this country,
when he could sweep this pestilence from the face of the earth
with one mighty gesture of his hand?
If our Lord wasn't testing us,
how would you account for the proliferation these days
of this obscene rock 'n' roll music,
with its gospel of easy sexuality and relaxed morality?
If our Lord wasn't testing us, why, he could take
If our Lord wasn't testing us, why, he could take all these pornographic books and albums,
and turn them into one big fiery cinder like that!
But how would that make us stronger for him?
One of these days, my Lord is gonna come to me
and ask me for an explanation
for the lives of each and every one of you.
And what am I gonna tell him on that day?
That I was busy?
That I was tired?
That I was bored?
No! I can never let up.
I welcome his test.
I welcome this challenge from my Lord,
so that one day I can deliver all of you unto his hands.
And when that day dawns,
I don't want to have to do any explaining.
I don't want to be missing from your lives.
Praise the Lord in singing hymn number 397,
What a Friend We Have in Jesus.
ALL: ♪ What a friend we have in Jesus
♪ All our sins and griefs to bear ♪
I will. You have a good week, now.
We'll see you. Bye-bye, Elway.
SHAW: Mrs. McCormack, your sister has us so excited about you coming.
Oh, thank you.
Did you meet my wife, Vi? No.
How do you do? How nice to meet you.
Welcome. This is my son, Ren.
Hello, Ren. Hi.
VI: Would you excuse me for a minute? Catch.
Daddy.
Oh, Ariel, will you come and meet the McCormacks?
The stunning new gentleman.
This is, uh, this is Mrs. McCormack and her son... Is it Ren?
Ren.
(GIGGLING) Ren's gonna be new at the high school tomorrow.
Hi. Hi.
Daddy, me, Edna, Wendy Jo and Rusty
are going down for a soda at the Hi-Spot, okay?
How you doing? REN: Okay.
Bye. See you.
Ariel, remember you have school tomorrow.
ARIEL: I'll be home for supper.
WENDY JO: God, is he excellent!
What? The new kid? Ah, he's all right.
What are you, blind? He's gorgeous.
So, have you seen the new high school? No, I haven't had the chance.
WENDY JO: Oh, my God, I almost forgot! (GIRLS EXCLAIMING) Cindy Addis had her baby.
EDNA: Oh, my God. What was it?
RUSTY: Who told you? Who told you?
Yesterday, my mother spoke to her mother.
Oh, my... Is she coming back for graduation?
I don't feel a bit sorry for her.
I don't feel a bit sorry for her. You can't buy a diaphragm through the mail. I'm serious. Right?
You can't buy a diaphragm through the mail. I'm serious. Right?
Well, did she decide who the father was?
There's no question it was Duane Capps.
No, wait a minute!
I'd been going with Duane Capps. He never had the time.
Well, how long does it take, Wendy Jo?
Ladies and gentlemen, moving up behind us,
you'll notice the incredible Barf-mobile. Crap.
Hey, Chuck.
Come on. Come on.
Hi, girls. Going my way?
You lonely tonight?
You want a race? You got a race.
What, that piece of junk?
Step on it! Come on! I am stepping on it.
Come on.
No guts, huh?
In back of us, buddy.
Take this, Rusty. Hey.
Come on. CHUCK: You chicken.
Hey, Chuck! Come on, I'll take you all on, girls.
Hey! Come on.
Come on, Chuck! What are you doing?
Come on! Edna, slow down, okay, please?
Throw it, honey. Throw it. Are you ready?
Come on. I'll get closer.
Come on, you can do it, honey.
Yeah.
Ariel, will you stop it? Now.
Ariel, get in the car and stop showing off.
It's not funny. You're gonna kill yourself!
Chuck, please be careful!
He's testing us! He's testing us!
Ariel, watch out. There's a truck!
(WHOOPING) Get in the car now!
CHUCK: Shit. Get in the truck, Ariel. Ariel, get into the car!
Ariel, be careful!
Come on! Get in!
Get in!
Jesus, he should never have let her done that.
Oh, my God.
So, have you met any of your teachers?
No, I haven't had a chance.
Oh, Reverend, they've only been here eight hours.
Now, I took care of all that last week.
Registered him and everything. ELEANOR: Vi, I made you
some of those Tollhouse squares I promised.
Lulu, you taste one of these, you'll burn your recipe.
Reverend, we have a little problem.
I heard that the English teacher over at the school
is planning to teach that book. Slaughterhouse-Five.
Isn't that an awful name? Oh, yeah, it's a great book.
Slaughterhouse-Five.
Yeah, it's... It's a classic.
Do you read much?
Maybe in another town, it's a classic.
In any town.
Tom Sawyer is a classic.
No, that's fine, Ethel.
Ethel, honey, here, have some more ham.
No, no. LULU: You sure Ren doesn't want something?
ETHEL: No, I don't think so. We're both a little tired from the move.
AMY: I think I'm gonna take Ren a potato.
WES: Amy, come back and sit down.
I'm sure your cousin's fine.
I'm sure it's a shock to the system, moving out here from the big city.
But what if he's starving? Amy, you are so lame.
Sarah, Amy, eat.
Oh, I can't sit still! I'm so excited you're both here!
Ethel, you sure you're not too tired?
No, Ren did most of the driving.
If you ask me, Ren is a total fox.
LULU: (GASPING) Amy. WES: Where did you hear that?
Ethel, you see how television and those kinds of books
influence children? You see?
(HORNS HONKING)
WENDY JO: What the hell is your problem?
Chuck Cranston, are you crazy? You're sick!
Hey, Ariel, here's your sweater.
Ariel, are you out of your mind? I could kill you!
You almost did, Edna.
Yeah, that's what you get for sniffing spray starch.
After he graduated, they drained his brain.
Hey, Edna, you getting fries?
If I am, you can't have any.
Wendy Jo. Wendy Jo!
Yes? Bring me Edna's fries.
Oh, sure.
Hey, where you going?
What are you doing?
Smuggled tapes. Hey, you be careful with that.
Your daddy hears you playing it, he'll bust your butt.
♪ Hey, don't you wanna hit the floor Then he put his hands all over her.
GIRL 1: (WHISPERING) Hey, man, it's the Reverend.
GIRL 2: Man, we're all gonna get it.
Your mother didn't think you had any money with you.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) ETHEL: Ren. Yeah, Mom.
Are you about ready to go? Uh-huh.
Are you gonna wear that tie?
Yeah.
Think you might wanna dress down for now.
Well, I like the tie.
September, when you go off to college, you can dress like David Bowie.
Come on, let's go.
BOY 1: Do you want the assignment or what? GIRL: Buzz off!
I didn't do anything!
BOY 2: In a minute!
Oh, yeah, right.
Why don't you comb your hair?
Shit, mister, where you going? I--I didn't see you.
Shit, mister, where you going? I--I didn't see you. Son of a bitch, you're supposed to look.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey.
Where'd you learn how to drive anyway? You're supposed to stay on the right side.
Hey, I like that hat, man.
They sell men's clothes where you got that?
BOY: Willard, come on.
What's your name?
Ren. Yeah?
My name's Willard. Hewitt.
Good to meet you. How you doing?
All right. I'll see you around. All right.
BOY: Willard, I swear, one of these days...
Hey, that tie is fabulous.
I mean it. It's fabulous. Don't let anyone tell you any different.
Ariel.
Right?
Very good.
(EXCLAIMING) Girl, you are on.
Chicago, wow, man. Must be wild, like  The Naked City.
Can I have the fish?
I'll tell you, man, you're gonna bounce off the goddamn walls here.
So, what do you do there?
I don't know. Same thing you do here. What do you do here?
Lot of this. Yeah, that, too.
Oh, I'll tell you, man,
there was this place called the Blue Heaven.
Yeah? It was great.
You had to steal IDs to get in this place, but it was incredible, you know.
It's like... It was like a huge, underground circus, you know?
Hot-pink neon climbing up the walls
and astral music. And girls, millions of girls.
Like, from the university, mostly.
If we could get one of them to dance, just one, then that was it.
We get out on the floor and really start to smoke, you know.
We start cutting in on each other, and these girls would just stop whatever they were doing.
and these girls would just stop whatever they were doing.
And they'd look. They'd look? They'd look how?
You know, they start to warm up a little. Right?
Pretty soon, they start buying us beers.
They're buying you guys beers? Oh, yeah.
Oh, shit. Oh, yeah.
Oh, wait, there was this one.
(LAUGHING) This was the best. Ginger.
Now, listen, we started dancing, right?
Slow dancing, like we're stuck to each other.
Now, eventually, it's obvious to me
that she wants to do more than dance, right?
So we left the place.
On the way to the car, she's already got her tongue in my ear. Okay?
We get to the car,
and she says we can't go back to her place because of her roommate, right?
But she says, "Hey, that's no problem."
She's got these seats in the car that recline back.
All the way back, if you know what I'm saying.
All the way?
Would I shit you? Right?
She rips my shirt open. She's clawing my chest.
She's biting my neck, and I'm trying to get over the stick shift
She's biting my neck, and I'm trying to get over the stick shift because we're going like a freaking freight train now.
All of a sudden, she starts screaming at the top of her lungs,
"Oh, God! Oh, God!
"Don't stop! Don't stop! Make Ginger pop!"
Oh, shit, really? No.
Yeah, but we did dance, so...
We danced our asses off. RUSTY: Willard.
Willard, how could you let our new student eat this food?
You don't eat this.
No, we have some delicious homemade food over there.
Come on over. It's so good. Yeah, come on.
Come on, Willard. Hi.
Oh, chicken. Mmm.
Come on. Come on. Good boy.
Good boy, bring your friend. You won't get any of that here.
What's that?
Dancing, there's no dancing, Ren.
That's right. Why?
It's illegal.
Jump back.
It's true. WILLARD: Has been for about five or six years.
Why? Go ahead, tell him.
Started when a bunch of kids got killed in a car wreck.
Whole town went bananas,
blaming it on the music and the liquor and dancing.
Now they're just convinced it's all a sin.
Who's convinced?
Whole damn town.
So, you really can't dance here, man?
I can't believe that. It's true.
This isn't the only place either. You'd be surprised.
Places upstate you can't dance.
Places in Kansas and Arkansas.
All over the place. My cousin lives in Montana,
and you can't dance where she lives either.
Yeah, she ever get busted for bopping?
I don't know. Never asked her.
You rich?
No. No, why?
Because I don't think I ever bought a tape before.
Get serious.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) This place is too weird. Don't you ever listen to the radio?
No. We got one radio at home, but it's never on.
You like Men at Work? Which men?
Men at Work. Where do they work?
They don't. They're a music group. What do they call themselves?
Oh, no. Well, what about the Police?
What about them?
You heard them? No, but I've seen them.
What, in concert? No, behind you.
What?
(SIREN WAILING) Oh, shit.
OFFICER 1: Wanna step out of the car?
Could you tell me what the problem is?
OFFICER 2: Will you just step out of the car, please?
Hey, Jim, these plates are Illinois state.
So? So, you got a license?
Jim, catch.
Hey, I just bought that. Hey.
Playing it kind of loud, weren't you? Is there a law against loud music?
Is there a law against loud music? Let's watch that attitude, boy.
This way, I don't have to take you in.
$25. They wouldn't even let me off with a warning.
Well, you can't talk to our police the way you talk to those big-city police.
But I wasn't doing anything.
Yeah, sure. LULU: Sarah, hush.
Ren, there was this bunch of kids snuck over the state line
a year or so ago to see some rock 'n' roll group,
and they were stopped on their way back into town by the police.
They were on church and school probation for weeks.
So you better watch your step around here, young man.
Daddy? Hmm?
I'm sorry about the other night at the drive-in.
I mean, about the music.
I was surprised.
Yeah.
Daddy?
I don't know what came over me.
You know, I can't always be with you, Ariel.
I can't always look out for you.
What's the music?
Oh, it's... I think it's Haydn. Chamber pieces.
And that kind of music's okay?
And that kind of music's okay? It's uplifting.
It doesn't confuse people's minds and bodies.
I don't...
What?
I see.
Listen, could you tell your mother to go on to bed?
I still have a lot of work to do down here.
Yeah, I will.
Daddy? What is it?
Good night. Good night, hon.
Hey, Chas. I'll catch you later.
Here, grab my books.
Let me in.
How you doing? What a...
Hey, you the new kid?
I'm talking to you.
Where'd your tie go?
I thought only pansies wore neckties.
Oh, yeah, I can see that.
I thought only assholes used the word "pansy".
(EXCLAIMING) He got you on that one, Chas. Shut up!
CHUCK: Son of a bitch is gonna pay for that.
Either you got jumbo coconut balls, or you're really pretty stupid.
Who is that douche bag?
Oh, he's just a little weasel, but you gotta watch your back.
ANDY: Can you operate a palette jack?
REN: Uh-uh. How about a bag closer? Uh-uh.
Where you from? Chicago.
You're not stupid, are you?
Hey, you trying to piss me off?
Well, boy, a lot of folks are gonna give you problems right off
because, you see, you're an outsider.
You're dangerous.
They're always gonna worry about you.
Screw them.
And this is only one little corner of the world.
Start Thursday?
Sounds okay.
Yes.
Oh, hi, Ariel.
Chuck Cranston wants to see you.
Meet him over out the back of his daddy's field tomorrow, 5:30.
So, what happens tomorrow at 5:30?
You're gonna have to show up to find out.
And if I don't?
People will know you're scared.
Anyway, Chuck will find you. You want that?
MAN: Hey, Ren, you're backing up in here. Where are you?
Hey, hey. Yo, yo!
How come he sent you?
I volunteered.
MAN: Hey, McCormack, where the hell are you?
You know her?
And so she tells me that I...
(GRUNTING) That I pissed Chuck off, right?
So he wants to see me.
And she walks away. He's betting you're gonna chicken and never...
He's betting you're gonna chicken and never... Impressive.
No.
Kind of out of it.
I had to go to work last year.
Well, you still move it.
Ooh, you better watch that. Ariel's gonna tell her pop,
Ooh, you better watch that. Ariel's gonna tell her pop, and you're gonna burn.
Yeah, what's her story?
Is she really tough or what?
No, she's just trying to make people forget she's a preacher's kid.
Is that why she hangs out with Chuck? Maybe.
People think she's a hell-raiser.
Is she? I think she's been kissed a lot.
Ow! Chuck! You'd never guess your daddy's a fire chief.
You'd never guess your daddy's a minister, red boots.
My daddy hates me wearing these boots.
And you love that, don't you, huh?
What are you gonna do when I go away to college?
Why you wanna do that, honey?
Just 'cause.
I'm cut out for more than this small town.
You're as small-town as they come.
A chicken race with tractors?
How hard could it be, right? Just like a car. It's easy.
Just like driving a sports car.
Nothing could be simpler.
Oh, hell, Ren, just remember to stay calm.
Calm. "Calm," he says. I've never driven a tractor before.
It's easy. Look, this is your clutch.
You got your clutch down here. Your gas and your brake. You start off, you just shift it into high.
Your gas and your brake. You start off, you just shift it into high.
You start off, you wanna shift it into high.
Don't worry about your one, two, three, four.
Don't worry about that. Stick it in third. Once you get going, put it into fourth.
That's your emergency brake. These operate your bucket.
Don't mess with the buckets.
CHUCK: Yeah, I'll bet he's scared shitless, and he turns out in 10 seconds.
Hey, Chuck, you sure you're up to this?
Whose side are you on anyway, honey?
You had a lot to smoke.
Don't tell me I had enough to smoke.
I didn't say you had enough to smoke. I said, you had a lot to smoke.
Well, don't tell me that either.
Why don't you go tell dogface we're ready to go?
Yeah! Let's go. All right. Let's do it.
Okay, I'll catch you later. Come on, man. This race is already won.
Come on, man. This race is already won.
GIRL: Come here. Ren, just remember he's chickenshit. Just hang in there.
Ren, just remember he's chickenshit. Just hang in there.
You're gonna be great. Just hope to God he pulls out.
Yeah, 'cause I don't wanna split his face open.
RUSTY: Cool it, Tarzan. Give him hell, Ren.
Get him, Ren. GIRL: Come on, Ren. We're with you.
How did I get myself into this?
Hey, Woody. Woody, come here.
Listen, uh.
Has anybody ever died doing this?
Just once.
ARIEL: Hey, Ren! Hey, sport.
When this hat flies in the air,
you better have your butt in gear.
WOODY: Forget her. WILLARD: I got my fingers crossed, buddy. GIRL: Come on!
RUSTY: Go on, Ren!
Go!

Excuse me. Thank you. (DOORBELL CHIMES)
I don't believe this town. MAN: Get rid of them.
Hello.
Tell me. Okay.
He has team practice every day until 4:00.
On Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, he works at the Beamis Mill till 6:00. Whoops!
You already knew that, right? Mmm-hmm.
Okay. He hasn't dated since he's been in town.
And late Friday nights...
Yeah? ...by the light of the full moon,
he, uh, breaks into churchyards and bites the heads off live chickens.
Come on, Ariel. What is it? Chuck?
Look, I never did think he had all his dogs barking anyway.
Besides, what is wrong about getting a little psyched over Ren?
He's cute.
He's from out of town. And don't tell me that doesn't curl your toes.
Ariel, I know you too well.
You want out of here so bad you probably memorized bus schedules.
And you don't?
RICH: Hey, asshole.
Interested in some really good shit?
Oh, my God, Rich. You sly little shit, you just made a whole sentence.
Don't get smart-ass.
I been watching you these past couple of weeks.
I know you're not stupid.
And I got a friend here who can help you out from time to time.
Oh, no. Thanks a lot, man. Thank you, but I got my own sources.
I been getting into hog tranquilizers. What do you say we call this a sample,
and you know where you can get some more.
Rich. Rich, hold up, man. Look, look, I--I don't want your shit.
Why don't I just take it.
You're taking some real chances being new in this school.
Mr. Gurntz, I gotta show you something, wait, this is tea.
Come back here.
What are you doing?
(TOILET FLUSHING) You think I'd do that with a real joint?
Do you know what an o-z is going for these days?
I'm gonna get you.
You wait.
The Reverend was right about you.
WES: Seems that a bunch of kids was raising some hell
out at Burlington Cranston's property a few days back.
Tore up the fields, turned over a tractor and everything.
Today, someone suggested to me there's been some trouble
up at the high school.
I think it was drugs.
You wouldn't know anything about that?
No.
What'd you say? I can't hear you.
He said, "No."
Amy.
I said, "No, sir."
Well, you know, Ren, whenever we used to call up
to your folks there in Chicago,
I don't think there was any trouble back there, was there?
And I don't know what to make of it.
But it seems a lot of people
are pointing a finger in your direction lately.
And what are they saying?
What I have been telling you about the trouble and the drugs and...
You just seem to be having a lot of trouble since you moved here.
And I figured...
You figured where there's smoke, there's fire, right?
Usually works like that.
Now, look, Ren,
you know that I would never try to take the place of your father.
Yeah, well, there's no chance of that.
Ren.
(TIRES SCREECHING) Uh-oh. He's taking the car.
(EXCLAIMING) Big time!
(PANTING) What are you doing here?
Watching.
I thought I was alone.
Not in this town. There's eyes everywhere.
How come you don't like me? What makes you think I don't like you?
What makes you think I don't like you? Look, you never talk to me at school.
You never look at me.
Yeah, well, maybe that's because if I did,
your boyfriend would remove my lungs with a spoon.
Chuck Cranston doesn't own me.
Sure, he likes to act like he does, but he doesn't.
Do you wanna kiss me?
Someday.
Hey, what is this "someday" shit?
Well, I get the feeling you've been kissed a lot, you know.
I'm afraid I'd suffer by comparison.
You don't think much of me, do you?
You think I'm small-town?
I think Bomont's a small town.
I'm going away.
I've already applied to colleges.
You know, I applied to colleges my father doesn't even know I applied to.
He's gonna come after me, but I'm gonna be gone.
Wanna see something?
Sure.
Well, we call it the yearbook.
It started four or five years ago, I guess.
It's stuff we're not supposed to read.
This is all out of books?
Well, most of it. Some songs, magazines.
Some is poems that get made up.
"I'll sing to you of silver swans
"Of kingdoms and carillons
"I'll sing of bodies intertwined Underneath an innocent sky"
You wrote that?
It's not even one of my best.
It's all right.
(TRAIN HORN BLOWING) Wait a minute.
You hear that?
What? The train, you hear it?
Sometimes after football games, we come out here.
Just a few of us, and we stand here.
Then when the train comes, we make out like crazy.
Oh, yeah?
Most of the time, we just stand and scream.
(BELL CLANGING) Scream?
Yeah, saw it in a movie once. Real loud. From here.
Hey, come on, don't screw around, huh?
Come on.
Come on, I'll take you home.
It's late.
Yeah.
It's kind of hard to impose a curfew on the young people in my congregation
that I can't even enforce in my own home.
Have you been drinking?
No.
You smoking something?
No!
I wasn't stealing, I wasn't gambling, I wasn't dancing.
I wasn't reading books I'm not supposed to.
I am late.
Well, who were you with?
Ren McCormack.
I don't want you to see him anymore.
Why? Because I've heard he's a troublemaker.
Just 'cause he hasn't lived in this town for 20 years
doesn't make him a troublemaker!
Ariel, I don't know what I'm gonna do with you.
There ain't nothing to do with me, Daddy.
You like it or not, this is it.
It doesn't get much better.
Hey, what the hell happened?
Why'd you get kicked off the team?
Because somebody's got it in for me.
Now, somehow Coach finds out that I brought Ariel home late last night,
so I'm a troublemaker, right?
Yeah, but that's not why I'm off the team, see. No, no.
I'm off the team because they just don't have the funds
for one more gymnast this year, but thank you anyway.
I'm busting my balls trying to fit in here,
and every door is getting slammed in my face.
Hey, McCormack. Sorry to hear you got caught.
BOY: Don't fool around with the preacher's daughter.
How does anybody live in this town?
You know what it is, partner? You got an attitude problem.
Oh, I got an attitude problem? Yes.
And I'm not the only one who's noticed it, Ren.
I mean, we're not living in the goddamn Middle Ages here.
We got TV. We got  Family Feud.
We're not stuck in  Leave It to Beaver land here.
Yeah, well, I haven't noticed a wet T-shirt contest in town yet.
Yeah, well, I haven't either, but I'm waiting. Patiently.
I tell you what I'd like to do, man.
I'd like to glue a  Playboy centerfold
inside of every one of Reverend Moore's hymnals.
Yeah, you know what else we could do.
We could start one of your nightclubs, right there in the church, huh?
Hey, that's it.
That's it, man.
What? What's it?
What? What's it? A dance.
What? A dance!
We could have a dance! You know, a dance? You know, dance?
Hey, come on. You know what I mean, dance!
You're gonna get me angry, man.
We're gonna turn this town upside down!
Stop it.
(CHILDREN CHATTERING) You know, I was down in Denver last year
for about a week, at a Bible convention there.
And the whole time I was there, people would come up to me
and ask me, "Reverend, how can you live in such a small town?
"So far away from the hustle and bustle of the 20th century?"
I'd say to them, "You'd never ask me that
"if you could just once, just for one minute,
"experience the feeling of family
"that comes from knowing that all of our lives are tied up
"that comes from knowing that all of our lives are tied up "with each other's,
"that we feel all the same joys,
"same sorrows,
"and that we care.
"Each and every one of us cares for the other."
I told them,
"I just feel closer to my Lord out there,
"and I feel closer and safer with my people,
"and I think they feel closer to me.
"The Lord smiles on us out there.
"And that's where I'm staying."
Why don't you have some cake?
(PEOPLE CHATTERING) SHAW: Roger, the Town Council has no intention of bowing
to the wishes of a small group of students.
ROGER: Reverend, Eleanor and I are absolutely certain
that we know for a fact that this boy is organizing a dance.
We're not gonna have any dance.
Let some young punk push us around now,
it won't be long before every standard in the community is violated.
(PHONE RINGING) Excuse me.
REN: Come on. ARIEL: Boy, are they in a tizzy.
RUSTY: Ariel, get in the car. They got the whole council going.
WILLARD: There's a town meeting I ain't gonna miss.
ARIEL: Hey, Ren, where you taking us? REN: We're going over the state line.
I want you guys to see what you've all been missing.
I want you guys to see what you've all been missing. RUSTY: Ren, I know you're not gonna let Willard fight, right?
WILLARD: I don't fight. Oh, right, and I don't breathe.
♪ Said put away those young boy ways Are you gonna dance, man?
I drink better than I dance.
Oh, come on. Come on.
I'll watch you guys, see if you can show me something new.
Come on, well, we didn't come all this way just to sit it out, man.
I'll be out there, I'll be out there. Don't worry about it.
I'm just gonna grab a beer.
Hey, come on, man.
Don't be an asshole. They're waiting to dance with us.
I can't dance.
You what? I... I can't dance.
At all.
All right. All right.
Buy him a beer.
Hey, Rusty, take my jacket.
♪ Just tryin' to give myself a little bit of fun, yeah What's the matter?
What's the matter? My feet have been hurting all since this morning, and I...
They weren't hurting in the car. I wanna sit this one out.
Willard, I wanna dance. I wanna get a beer.
♪ Sometimes I don't know Waitress, let me get another beer.
♪ You're burning, yearning for some Hey!
♪ That life ain't passing you by I can't help myself, Willard!
♪ Jack, get back ♪ Hey. I came with that girl.
Doesn't look like you're leaving with her.
Hey, I guess you didn't hear me the first time.
Willard, no fights. You don't even know this guy.
Why don't you just flake off, huh?
Hey!
Willard, no fights.
When's the last time you seen your dick, partner?
Hey!
MAN: Hey, break it up.
ARIEL: You know, Rusty, he was fighting to save your honor.
RUSTY: It's too late.
I don't fight.
Hey, Ren, is your dance gonna be like this one?
Everything but the fight.
Well, forget it.
(SCREAMING) Come on.
(YELPING) ALL: ♪ Up on the roof, oh, yeah ♪ 100 proof, oh, yeah
♪ Oh, ain't that fine, oh, yeah ♪ You cherry slime, oh, yeah ♪
I hate this bridge. It gives me the creeps.
REN: How come?
You've heard this one.
The infamous Crosby Bridge accident, right?
You've heard it.
No.
Oh, you're missing out.
About five years ago,
these kids were playing highway tag, and they were drunk.
So one car hits the other one,
and they both go over the edge of the bridge.
Dead.
That's when they started passing the laws against booze,
against dancing and drinking and... I don't know.
My father had a field day.
Your father, why?
My older brother was the one that got killed.
RUSTY: God, you should've seen Bobby.
He was like Warren Beatty, only taller, wasn't he?
My father went off the deep end.
He decided we all needed saving, no matter what.
He's gonna personally
save this little pissant town, and he's gonna deliver it up to heaven,
with his daughter sitting like a cherry on top of it.
I called over to Rusty's last night.
I don't understand why you feel it necessary to lie to me.
I don't know why you find it necessary to check up on me.
I'm concerned about your well being, that's all.
Well, how come when I'm here at home you're never as interested
in what I'm doing or saying as you are when I walk out that door?
Bam! Suddenly you wanna know everything.
Ariel, I don't know what's provoked this outburst, but I don't like it
any more than I like not knowing where you were for six hours last night.
Shaw. Don't you think we could wait on this?
Shaw. Don't you think we could wait on this? No, I don't think this can wait.
You know, I'm sick and tired of you coming in on her side.
She's gonna have to start answering for herself.
I don't know what good that will do.
You don't listen to me any more than you listen to her. (GROANS)
I've never hit anyone in my life.
No.
We're losing her, Vi.
Don't you see that?
No.
I see you chasing after her, and I see her running from you.
She's become so willful
and obstinate.
She's like her father.
The two of you were so wonderful once.
And you had so much to talk about.
I was almost jealous.
Well, it's not as if we don't talk.
It's just that
sometimes people run out of things to say.
Shaw?
It's 20 years now I've been a minister's wife.
And I've been quiet, supportive, unobtrusive,
and, uh, after 20 years, I still think you're a wonderful...
You're a wonderful preacher.
You can lift a congregation up so high they have to look down to see heaven.
But it's the one-to-one where you need a little work.
We could really use your support on this thing.
I really don't think my mother would approve.
Oh, yeah, but we're not talking about a free-for-all.
It won't be a drunken brawl. It's just a dance.
Well, just--just give it some thought, okay? Sleep on it, okay?
Just think about it. Okay, thanks.
Senior prom, sounds great to me. See you later.
How you doing, boy? You need any help you just let me know.
Okay, you got it. (GRUNTING) Don't forget.
Now, Chuck has heard something
that's upset him real good, and I want you to tell me it ain't so,
Mr. Chicago-Big-Shot.
See, he's been hearing you're gonna try and throw a dance at school.
A senior dance. And he figured only a dumb, son-of-a-bitch faggot would try that.
Is that what you're trying? He sure the hell is!
Excuse me, girls. Come on out, Ren.
You guys stay right there.
WENDY JO: Is he really gonna get us the dance? Yep. Ain't you?
It's about time, McCormack. I'll be there.
Thanks.
Look, don't you have any better manners than that?
Didn't your mama teach you better?
You treat animals like that, huh? How's it feel?
Don't feel too good now does it, huh?
What are you talking about?
You're gonna have to fight city hall.
What do you mean, I gotta fight city hall?
Because, Mr. McCormack, there's a town council.
It's made up of about seven people.
Shaw Moore's one of them. Burlington Cranston is another one.
Personally, I don't like that lousy son of a bitch.
They meet every third Thursday of the month.
If there's something you want in this town,
you're gonna have to go talk to them.
You're gonna get really creamed. Jeez. I'm not so good with words.
Jeez. I'm not so good with words.
Keep thinking like that, Ren, and you are gonna get creamed.
So? I mean, Woody over here doesn't know a dance from a dipstick.
And you do? You do, huh? Which way is your left?
Huh? Willard, which way is your left?
He don't know his left foot from his right foot.
I'll tell you something, man.
If I gotta get up in front of that council,
then you are gonna learn how to dance.
(WHOOPING) What is this, Roger? I don't know this book.
I would hope you wouldn't.
Reverend Moore, Mrs. Evans is calling about that dance over at the school.
Oh, would you tell her I'll call her back right after Junior Bible?
Oh, would you tell her I'll call her back right after Junior Bible? All right, now, what were you saying?
This was found in one of the athletic lockers over at the school.
A book like this should be burned.
We should go to the library
and remove this corruption from the shelves.
Well, there's no sense blowing it up into something that it isn't.
Hello! Careful.
Come on, Max.
I'll set up, Vi.
Well, I think it's quite obvious what it is.
Well, it's not quite so obvious how I should handle it.
Reverend, if you'll excuse my saying so,
when we got rid of that young English teacher over at the school,
we didn't get any support from you.
That's because I didn't think we had any grounds for his dismissal.
Well, Reverend, around here, it caused a lot of folks some worry.
Well, a lot of folks worry a little too much.
Doesn't take much time for corruption to take root, Reverend.
How long is that, Roger?
About as long as it takes compassion to die?
Say, do I get a cookie?
BOY: No! CHILDREN: No!
How about some milk? Did you drink all the milk?
BOY: Yes! CHILDREN: Yes!
I wanted to talk to... You don't have to tell me nothing!
I know why you don't call me up.
I wanted to tell you myself.
Oh, well, I know why you don't wanna see me anymore.
Hey, I'm not stupid!
I'm not blind.
It's McCormack, ain't it?
You're just dying to screw McCormack, aren't you?
Aren't you? You're so stupid!
Stupid? You think I don't see you looking at him like some bitch in heat?
You'd wrap those skinny legs around anybody.
Shut up!
Is that what I get, huh?
I treated you decent!
Shit.
Hey! Hey, put that down!
Don't even think about that!
Jesus! You stupid!
Stupid!
Stop it, Chuck!
You!
About through with you anyway!
I'm sorry you have to see me like this.
I'll be okay. I'll just sneak in at home. I'll be fine.
Do I look okay? Yeah, I think you'll pull through.
Thanks for coming for me.
I don't understand.
I mean, there's nothing to understand.
It's for taking on my father.
Oh, no, no, no, wait a minute.
Wait, I got no beef with him.
Wait, no, wait.
Wait, no, wait. This is my fight, you know. It's with the town. It's not with one guy.
You don't get to turn my fight into some kind of
You don't get to turn my fight into some kind of a "screw you" to your old man.
Hey, look...
Maybe...
Maybe... Maybe you shouldn't try so hard to forget your brother,
or to try to make your father forget him, you know?
It's not that easy.
I know. I know.
Do I still get the box? Huh? Give me the box.
That's nice.
Think you might ever kiss me?
Harvey and Bernie were here for a long time.
They still talking about that dance? Yeah.
What did you decide to do?
It's not gonna happen.
That's one more thing that Ariel's not gonna forgive me for, but...
Can you step out of the way long enough to realize
that she's doing all of this for you? Me?
I don't see that.
I just know that when kids dance together, they become sexually irresponsible.
I can't take the chance of...
Well, what's so funny?
You talk like that's the only thing that gets them excited.
Don't you remember when we used to look at each other and get excited?
Well, it's just the same with them.
You're not gonna put their eyes out.
No.
None of this is gonna undo one stupid accident.
I'm responsible for the spiritual life of this community.
Shaw, you can't be a father to everybody.
You can't do that.
I thought that at least you believed in me.
I never stopped.
See you at the town council meeting tomorrow night.
Only fairies dance.
Hey, I'll lay you flat, Ariel!
Support Ren McCormack at the council meeting tomorrow night.
You're bringing me down. RUSTY: You can make a difference!
RUSTY: You can make a difference!
I'm calling to remind you to come to the town council meeting tomorrow night and to show your support in favor of...
Hi.
Still hurt?
No. Good.
Nervous? No.
Look, I...
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm nervous.
Look, I don't know what I'm going to say to the council.
There's only the seven of them though, right?
Who else is gonna be there?
Everybody.
(SIGHING) Take a deep breath.
You ready?
What is it?
Holy Bible?
What?
Oh, this is great.
This is great!
How'd you know where to find all this?
Are you kidding?
Come here, I wanna tell you something.
Thanks.
Come on.
(GLASS SHATTERING) Come on.
(BABY WAILING) What the hell is that?
Oh, my God. LULU: Amy? What is it?
What's going on?
"Burn in hell"? This says, "Burn in hell."
Oh, Jesus. ETHEL: Oh, Ren, what the hell is going on?
Obviously, somebody's trying to make a point.
Do you see? Now do you see?
You don't go waving your flags around here without people taking shots...
Now, this is not the first time!
My business was off, but people are taking business away from me!
And your Aunt Lulu's been getting some ugly phone calls.
And today, your mother lost her job! ETHEL: Wes!
Mom, is that true?
Mr. Collins said he'd been hearing some things about you.
He thought I ought to stay home and be a proper mother.
And what did you say? I told him to shove it.
Now, damn it, Ethel, this is serious.
Wes, there's other jobs!
Where? LULU: Wes, shouldn't you call the police?
Well, I don't know how much good it'll do.
I'll get Jim Earlhaus over here.
Will you stop? Now will you stop?
I don't understand this town.
It's like something's choking everybody.
Only they don't know they're choking.
Let me ask you something. Why this dance in this town?
It's not just about a dance.
Not anymore. I know. That's what I mean.
I watch you. I see.
You're not gonna understand this.
Try me.
When Dad first threatened to leave, I thought it was because of me.
I thought it was something that I wasn't doing right.
And I figured there was something that I could do to make it like it was.
And then he'd wanna stay, you know.
But when he left, just like that,
and I realized that
everything that I'd done, hoping that he'd stay...
Everything I'd done, it...
It didn't mean shit, you know.
Didn't matter.
And I felt like, "What difference does it make?"
But now...
Now I'm thinking,
I could really do something, you know?
Like, I could really do something for me this time.
You know?
I don't know, otherwise I'm just gonna disappear.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING) All right, Virginia. I guess that ends the discussion on this issue.
All right, Virginia. I guess that ends the discussion on this issue.
"And so the price of a dog license will go from $3.50 to $4.50.
"A licensed pet is a happy one."
And that takes care of old business. Burlington?
(CLEARING THROAT) Thank you, Virginia. It was real good.
All right, now we can consider any new business.
Excuse me.
Before we begin, I just wanna remind all you kids
we're conducting an official meeting.
We're not gonna tolerate any disturbances.
Okay, the floor is now open for any new business.
My name is Ren McCormack, and I would like to move on behalf
of most of the senior class of Bomont High School
that the law against public dancing
within the town limits of Bomont be abolished.
Mr. Chairman, could I address myself to this?
You bet.
Even if this was not a law,
which it is,
I'm afraid I would have a lot of difficulty endorsing an enterprise
which is as fraught with genuine peril as I believe this one to be.
Besides the liquor and the drugs,
which always seem to accompany such an event,
which always seem to accompany such an event, the thing that distresses me even more, Ren,
is the spiritual corruption that can be involved.
These dances and this kind of music can be destructive.
And, uh, Ren, I'm afraid you're gonna find
that most of the people in our community are gonna agree with me on this.
I do. MAN: I agree.
That's all I have to say on that.
I believe a vote is in order on the motion.
All those opposed...
REN: Excuse me, I... I...
I would just like to say something, if I could.
Young man, sit down. It is outrageous!
If you think that... Eleanor, sit down.
I think Mr. McCormack has a right to be heard.
Well, I just... I just wanted to say a few words about this motion,
so that, uh, you wouldn't think that we were encouraging destruction
with this idea.
"From the oldest of times, "people danced for a number of reasons.
"They danced in prayer,
"or so that their crops would be plentiful,
"or so their hunt would be good.
"And they danced to stay physically fit
"and show their community spirit.
"And they danced to celebrate."
And that... That is the dancing that we're talking about.
Aren't we told in...
In Psalm 149?
"Praise ye the Lord.
"Sing unto the Lord a new song.
"Let them praise his name in the dance."
MAN 1: Amen. MAN 2: Amen.
It was King David...
King David, who we read about in Samuel.
And what did David do?
What did David do? What did David do?
(PEOPLE LAUGHING) "David danced before the Lord with all his might,
"leaping...
"Leaping and dancing before the Lord."
Leaping and dancing.
Ecclesiastes assures us
that there is a time to every purpose under heaven.
A time to laugh,
and a time to weep.
A time to mourn,
and there is a time to dance.
And there was a time for this law, but not anymore.
See, this is our time to dance.
It is our way of--of celebrating life.
That's the way it was in the beginning.
It's the way it's always been.
It's the way it should be now.
ANDY: You know you were railroaded, don't you?
Huh? Boy, when are you gonna wake up and smell the coffee?
Shaw Moore walked into that meeting with them votes already in his pocket.
You didn't have a prayer.
Bad pun, Andy.
Well, what are you gonna do now?
It's over.
What if it ain't?
What if you have your dance in Bayson?
No, no, the whole point was to do something here in Bomont.
Bayson's what, 30 miles away?
Not where it runs up to these tracks it ain't.
Huh? Now, I figure if the Bomont fire trucks can't cross these tracks,
well, neither can the long arm of the law.
Yeah, what about the long arm of Reverend Moore?
Remember he said if you could find a way to convince him
it wouldn't be a spiritual corruption, he'd think about it.
So? Make him think about it.
SHAW: "And I beheld and heard an angel
"flying through the midst of heaven, saying "with a loud voice, 'Woe, woe,
"with a loud voice, 'Woe, woe,
"'woe to the inhabiters of the earth.'
"And I saw a star fall "from heaven unto the earth,
"and to the angel was given the key
"to the bottomless pit. "And he opened the bottomless pit,
"And he opened the bottomless pit,
"And he opened the bottomless pit, "and there arose a smoke out of the pit, "as the smoke of a great furnace.
"And the sun and the air were darkened "by reason of the smoke of the pit."
Yes?
I used to get such a kick out of watching you work up your sermons.
And now?
It's different.
I see the stage. I see costumes.
It's show business, isn't it?
Well,
it's the only way I know to
reach people's emotions.
I haven't heard from you for a while.
When was it, Thursday?
I was angry, and you were angry.
I was not. Yes, you were.
If you weren't, you would've asked me what was wrong. You knew!
Ariel, I cannot let this dance happen.
Ren McCormack made a lot of people stop and think.
I object to that kind of music, and I think you know why.
Because people fornicate to it. I never said that!
That's what you told the church board! That was not meant for your ears!
When do my ears get old enough, Daddy? When do you stop protecting me?
I'm no saint, you know.
It is my duty to look after the spiritual growth of you...
I'm not even a virgin.
Don't you talk like that in here! Why not?
Isn't this where I'm supposed to confess my sins to my preacher?
In church!
I ask to be forgiven! Am I?
Oh, forgive me! Deliver me into thy soul! Don't not do that in here!
You know better than...
Reverend Moore! Thank heavens you're here. People are calling!
They're over at the library.
SHAW: Roger! Eleanor! What are you doing?
Reverend, we decided these books are influences...
Who's "we"? ...our children just don't need.
Whose authority do you have? You, yourself, agreed that this is...
You, yourself, agreed that this is... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Everybody listen to me!
When did you all decide to sit in judgment?
Who elected all of you to be the saviors of everybody's souls in Bomont?
Reverend, we have a perfect right to determine what our children... Roger!
to determine what our children... Roger!
When you've burned all of these,
what are you gonna do then?
Chris, take these out of here.
Satan is not in these books!
He's in here.
He's in your hearts.
Go on home, all of you.
Go and sit in judgment on yourselves.
Roger. Go home.
Roger. Go home. Reverend...
Eleanor, come on.
Go home, now. Come on, both of you.
Sometimes things don't make any sense.
If you could explain to me about my father,
maybe I could explain to you about your son.
But it doesn't make any sense.
Look, I gotta go.
Listen, I know you're gonna do what you gotta do,
but thanks for listening.
Ren.
Thank you for, uh...
Well...
Thank you.
That was your friend Ren.
He came here to ask me if he could take you to a senior prom.
I'm running out of answers, Ariel.
I know how hard it is for you.
I know I'm not making it easier.
I just don't know that I believe in everything you believe in.
But I believe in you.
I'm standing up here before you today
with a very troubled heart.
You see, my friends,
I've always insisted on
taking responsibility for your lives.
But I'm really
like a first-time parent
who makes mistakes
and tries to learn from them.
And like that parent,
I find myself at that moment when
I have to decide,
do I hold on,
or do I trust you to yourselves
to let go
and hope that you understood at least some of my lessons?
If we don't start trusting our children,
how will they ever become trustworthy?
I'm told that the senior class at the high school
has got use of a warehouse in Bayson
for the purpose of putting on a senior dance.
Please,
join me to pray
to the Lord
to guide them in their endeavors.
Lights!
You look very nice. Oh, no.
Yes, you do! No.
Yes, you look very nice. No.
Yes, you do. You look wonderful. No. You think?
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.
No.
You can't very well go to a prom without a corsage.
This is gorgeous!
Where do you think I should... Oh, it has a wrist thing.
Here, I'll show you. Oh, Mom, you really didn't have to.
I didn't.
Now, don't go on to him about it, because he'll only deny it.
I was gonna come up and...
I was
gonna come up and get you.
What's the matter?
You're beautiful.
What?
I--I mean it.
You are beautiful.
Come on.
Thank you.
Well, let's take a closer look.
No, she'll think I'm checking up again.
No, she won't even know we're here. Come on.
You're the last folks I expected to see around here tonight.
Evening, Andy. Hi, Andy.
Vi. Reverend, you done a good thing here.
Well, I'm still not sure it was the right thing.
Comes close.
Shaw.
Shaw?
Shaw.
What is it?
It's just the two of us again.
Shaw.
What?
We're almost dancing.
Hi, Rusty. Hi.
Hello, Willard.
Willard, you promised you won't fight, all right?
Don't you look sweet.
What do you want, Chuck? Oh, I got a little business with your friend McCormack.
Oh, I got a little business with your friend McCormack. Chuck, cool it, all right? No fights tonight, okay?
Chuck, cool it, all right? No fights tonight, okay?
Hey, no fights, fellows.
(BOYS LAUGHING) Sure, Willard.
All right.
Cute. No fights, Willard.
Damn, man! I told you, all right?
I promised Rusty no fights tonight, okay?
Let go of me. Let go, God damn it. Get off of me!
RUSTY: Oh, Willard. What do you want me to do, Rusty?
Kill the son of a bitch!
Help, somebody!
Chuck!
Hey, it's Mr. Dance-Fever.
Yeah, you're a goddamn hero when it's five to one!
ARIEL: Come on, Ren, get him! Beat the shit out of him.
Bastard!
You're gonna dance now, McCormack.
RUSTY: Yeah! All right!
Hey, handsome. Great dance, man.
Our heroes! Ren.
Ren. I thought you guys were gonna actually, like, fight or something.
You're great.
REN: Hey, hey, what's this I see?
