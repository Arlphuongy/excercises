The flight to Guangzhou departing at 11:45 is now boarding...
Hunger is eating at my soul.
A rare downpour in Beijing.
As if slurping a cold soup,
the subway systematically gulps the people down.
The harsh city makes the faces expressionless.
I'm probably one of them.
Going through the tedious cycle of life and trying to regain what I had cherished,
I feel like I misplaced something.
Numbed, we lose the taste of home.
That taste which I had forgotten now comes back to me.
The memories, where did they all go?
As the season turns, I recall the taste of rice noodles from my hometown.
What gave me strength was the one with seasonal ingredients,
the San Xian noodles.
"THE RICE NOODLES"
For many people in Hunan, the day begins
For many people in Hunan, the day begins with a bowl of hot, steaming noodles,
sweat on their face and taking in the moment.
Two bowls. Thank you.
My memories from childhood begin at this noodle shop with no sign.
Good morning.
Xiao Ming, my dear.
Grandma!
Rice noodles here are handmade.
They are transparent and beautiful.
The flavor has a playful bounce, giving the day's start a leisurely feel.
It was my time with Grandma.
My parents were both working, so it was with her I spent my mornings.
We ate San Xian noodles.
I was hooked on them.
The mushrooms were firm and fresh,
lustrous kikurage with a proper texture.
Blended into a thick soup, the flavors overlap,
Blended into a thick soup, the flavors overlap, indulging my palate and melting my heart.
Oh, my.
Warm steam touching my skin, the soup's aroma,
the sound of us munching.
No words could describe how much I loved this moment.
There were more secrets to its tastiness.
The meat and mushrooms were minced together,
the eggs were soft and fluffy,
mingling with the noodles down the throat.
And the flavors were enhanced by the amber-colored soup.
Other shops sometimes use MSG.
But here, they spent time and effort,
just a husband and wife making the rice noodles with care.
Eat all you want.
-Do you want another bowl? -Yes!
I later found out
the owner was a renowned chef in Beijing,
one of the top masters in Hunan.
One day he set out on his own
and settled here before I was born to open a noodle shop.
This shop made only San Xian noodles and kept it up for 20 years.
The handmade noodles always tasted the same,
as well as the soup.
They didn't talk much, but their rice noodles were loved by all.
Many people traveled from far away to eat it,
but there was no guarantee they could.
I lived right by the shop,
so I was lucky to eat the noodles every day.
Grandma once told me,
"If you like eating, you'll be blessed with delicious food."
All of a sudden, the owners closed the shop and disappeared.
It was said they were pushed out because of jealousy,
or an old client of theirs wanted them back in Beijing.
Wherever they go,
there will be many people who like to eat.
They are going to make those people happy with their noodles,
that's for sure.
The noodles at the shop close to school
weren't handmade and the texture was nothing special.
But the piping hot toppings were delicious.
Fried vegetables exuded flavor and flowed onto the soft noodles,
blanketing the soup.
It was different from the shop I went to with Grandma,
but I liked it nevertheless.
Aren't you a student at Fourth Academy's middle school?
-Yes. -My son goes there, too.
He's in his third year at the high school.
See you later, hon.
Maybe I can retire from this when my son finishes school and gets a job.
You are a growing boy. Eat to your heart's content.
Then study hard, okay?
Oh... thank you.
That girl was one year my senior,
and she passed here every day on her way to school.
Her hair glistened hazel in the sun.
I wanted to gaze at it forever.
One of the reasons why I came here was so that I could see her.
It was the joy of my life.
I don't know why... I just felt this would last forever.
That fall...
What's the layout here?
The noodle shop changed its appearance.
The husband wanted to switch jobs
and convinced his wife to open a fishing shop.
The happy mornings disappeared abruptly,
and with them, the rice noodles and the glimpse of her hair.
And so, the fishing shop opened,
but it seemed to not do very well.
What's going on?
You piss me off!
Somebody call the teacher!
What is it? What happened?
Are you okay?
It's all your fault! You never say anything!
The injured student was the son of the woman at the noodle shop.
I don't know what caused the fight, but the fishing shop closed its doors.
In my third year of middle school,
the noodle shop came back.
But something was different.
The husband was helping at the shop.
And there was another.
Thank you so much!
They looked happier than before. But...
I heard she recently graduated and went to another school far away.
It marked the end of my first love.
A very sad morning.
When I was little, I woke up to the smell of noodles.
The times I spent with Grandma, and in middle school, during those sweet moments looking at her.
and in middle school, during those sweet moments looking at her.
Now I'm by myself.
San Xian noodles, please.
Coming right up.
Number 12, San Xian noodle.
The machine-made noodles were almost too perfect.
The flavor of the Chinese-style soup was not bad.
But there were fewer toppings and the price was higher.
I used to love San Xian noodles, but it just doesn't taste the same.
Hey, Dad. What is it?
A 2.5-hour flight from Beijing.
I figured I could go home at any time,
but the distance was further than I thought.
The bright lights below me make my heart churn even more.
Is that you, Xiao Ming?
I'm sorry,
I don't think I can eat San Xian noodles with you anymore.
Don't say that. We are going to eat them together.
Grandma...
My shadow, dragged out by the night, melts away in the morning sun.
The torment I feel in my chest
will someday heal with time.
Some things never change, and some things will change...
What can I get you?
-A bowl of San Xian noodles. -Got it.
The warmth still lingers today from the comfort that left me yesterday.
Days that fled will never come back.
But I feel certain something is pushing my timid self.
It stays in the back of my mind as the seasons pass.
It was like a lonely, pale morning,
but also a morning blushed with hope.
Here you go.
"THE RICE NOODLES"
Ever since I was a child, I've loved cute clothes.
If I was wearing my favorite clothes, I'd be happy all day.
I felt invincible.
I liked choosing clothes for my little sister.
We played princess with my hand-me-downs.
But I started growing taller,
to the point where we couldn't exchange clothes anymore.
I've never liked being tall.
It attracts unnecessary attention, and I bump my head a lot.
But now, I'm grateful to my parents.
Lacking any other talents, I got my career thanks to the height my parents gave me.
Before I had a chance to thank them, they passed away.
I always realize the value of things after I lose them.
Everything that's precious.
The world's changing rapidly.
Clothing trends, people... and us models.
This career is not going to last forever.
But I still want to shine.
For my only family: my little sister.
"A LITTLE FASHION SHOW"
-That's a wrap, Yi Lin. -Thank you, everyone.
-Thank you so much. -You are welcome.
Don't do such a thing. What if you get hurt?
-Those clothes are valuable, right? -But still...
I was so happy when my picture appeared on a magazine for the first time.
My sister could see me even though we lived far apart.
But now, it's an everyday thing.
What do you see?
Cameras, lights, girls.
You are standing where most girls can only dream of.
Such a dreary outlook. Anything else?
I'm not inspired to say anything witty right now.
Sorry to ask you.
Great job, thank you.
Isn't that the new editor? You have to say something charming.
-Oh? -My dear...
How many years have you been doing this?
Can't you at least say something cute?
I'm more of an action-over-words type.
That mouth of yours.
We're all done! Thank you so much for your efforts.
I made... a cake for you.
Maybe Sis is busy.
Everyone ready?
Yi Lin, Happy Birthday!
-Happy Birthday! -Thank you.
NO NEW MESSAGES
I messed up.
Yi Lin!
Happy Birthday.
You came!
Your manager told me. Sorry to miss the photoshoot, but I was busy at work.
How about later?
Sorry. I gotta go back to the office.
I understand, if it's work...
Yi Lin!
-Have we met? -I'm Shui Jing. We're in the same agency.
-I've idolized you forever! -Really?
You're so popular in our school. Everyone copies you.
-Thank you. -Still a student? You're very mature.
Yes!
You'll be a hit.
-A new generation's coming. -Thank you.
I was hoping I could get advice from you on how to be successful in this business.
Advice? I don't really have any. Please.
-Give her some pointers. -Let me think...
Shui Jing, over here. I'm coming!
Excuse me, I have to go.
I didn't say anything.
-She has it, the shine. -Didn't notice.
Don't think you're always going to be on the top.
-What's that supposed to mean? -I'm going to go say hi.
-Don't worry about it. -Shut up. Today's my birthday.
-You have bad taste in men. -Shut up.
Get hold of yourself.
Good evening, Lu Lu.
-Thank you so much. -Don't mention it. Part of the job.
That's why I said to bring Lu Lu.
I don't like when there are  lots of people.
-How are you going to meet anyone? -You're one to talk.
Lu Lu's homemade cake is so delicious!
It really is good.
My Lu Lu's so handy, she can do anything.
That's not true.
You ate dinner, right?
I'm sorry, but Steve will eat my portion.
What, me?
Home is the best. Lu Lu is here with me.
-Good night. -You're being too irresponsible!
I'd love to show the staff Yi Lin's true self.
I'm sorry. You prepared all this for her.
-I was just making dinner for myself. -Such a feast?
It's all thanks to her.
Because of her, I could go to school.
Sorry I'm late!
-Sis... -Long time no see, Lu Lu.
From today, we will always be together.
Let's go eat. There are some great restaurants nearby.
I thought Sis was so gorgeous, shining,
as if she was from another star.
And now she's a sea lion.
Steve!
Don't be hitting on Lu Lu.
I don't hit on girls.
It's time for me to leave.
Yi Lin! Don't be late for the audition tomorrow.
Got it.
Sis, it's morning. Wake up.
Morning, Lu Lu.
-I'm going to school. Are you good? -No worries, see you later.
Five more minutes...
I'm in trouble... whole loads of trouble.
You're late. What's wrong with you?
-I overslept, all right? -You...
You are late.
Next.
Nice.
Next.
Next.
That place is for kids.
You think I'm too old?
You're supposed to say no.
There's always next time. Something more suitable for you.
Hi! Next time, huh? It's crowded at the top. On my way to work. Talk to you later.
-I got the gig! -Shui Jing?
What's going on?
They told me on our way out Shui Jing was getting the job.
Don't tell me stuff like that.
Fashion Week is coming up.
Shui Jing is gonna be in it, too.
It's from Lu Lu. She's asking if you want dinner.
Why doesn't she ask me?
Because you don't answer.
Younger is better?
I can't believe something like this bothers me so much.
-Hey... -What is it?
Nothing.
-Did you eat? -I don't want to.
You're not eating lately.
Got to get ready for Fashion Week.
Take care of yourself.
Don't worry, I've been doing this forever.
-But Sis-- -What do you know?
What is it?
I'm fine. Do your own thing.
Sis... where are you going?
-To the gym. -Don't overdo it.
It's rough...
My secret to beauty?
Nothing special.
Yeah, right. I wish.
Do you know what it takes behind the scenes?
But I don't want Lu Lu to see me this way.
I can't, I won't.
After our parents died, we were sent to separate relatives.
I'm sure it was rough on her.
It was rough on me.
When I decided to take in Lu Lu,
everyone said it was a bad idea, but I didn't care.
I am greedy.
A modeling career and being Lu Lu's amazing sister...
I want both.
You're kidding me...
The only thing I've got going for myself is this body.
Beauty will slip away if you let it.
No matter what it takes, I'm not letting it go.
You've been killing yourself. What's the matter?
It's not a big deal. I'm a professional.
I'm worried about you.
Please... let me go out there.
Okay. But know your limits.
You look awful.
Maybe you should skip this. This is nothing.
I dreamed about this stage, now it's gonna come true.
But now, I want to see what's beyond this.
Do you see it? It's gonna happen right now.
It's almost showtime. My glorious future!
Listen to me.
You watch me.
I still have it...
I... messed up.
Yi Lin, are you okay?!
You really like those clothes, don't you?
Yes! I love this color the most.
Let's go, Lu Lu.
Mom...
Awake?
-I saw Mom in my dream. -A dream?
When we were kids, she was always sewing.
When I'm sewing, I remember Mom, too.
She told me when she was sewing, she could see the skies of her hometown.
What's that mean?
I don't know.
What do you see, Lu Lu?
I see... the people who wear my clothes.
If my clothes make someone happy, I'll be happy, too.
That sounds nice.
My injury was going to take a while to heal.
When I stopped working, it seemed like I had disappeared.
There are plenty of replacements.
The world will move on just fine without me.
Now that rehab's done, you can finally get back to work.
About that... I'm kind of sick of it.
-Do you want to take a break? -I don't want to go back.
You want to... quit? It may be time.
I see.
Can you teach me how to do that?
Using the sewing machine and stuff. I want to learn a trade.
How dare you!
Why are you talking to me like that?
I have to work. Who do you think I'm doing it for?
You mean you're doing it for me? That ends the conversation, doesn't it?
Don't look at me that way.
You don't get it!
-Where are you going? -School.
At this hour?
Geez...
This is cute.
We lived together and I didn't know.
I didn't even try to.
I'm such a fool.
Ever since, she's been staying late at school,
like she doesn't want to see me.
After being a stranger for so long, you call me for this?
We've never fought since we started living together.
-It seems you're back. -What're you talking about?
You can't fight without energy.
Anyways, you were... just kidding me, right? That thing about retiring.
Dead serious. I'm up there in age.
My job is over then.
-I guess so. -Everybody leaves me.
You and me could've been a team for a long time.
-What're you going to do? -I don't know.
-I can't see the future. -So you haven't a clue.
But I'm going to make money.
I'm giving up modeling, but I want to support Lu Lu.
Didn't you say you wanted both?
You're gonna lose both your career and Lu Lu.
You don't even have a man.
A loner.
-Why are you saying such mean things? -I'm no longer your manager.
I'll say whatever I want.
After all the money you made from me, you thankless ass!
You're the worst when you say things like that.
Maybe you said to Lu Lu, "Who do you think lets you live?"
No... I never said it that way.
But you say it in a different way.
Ugh. Disgusting.
Do you really think I can come back after that embarrassing incident?
-It's up to you. -You are so cold about things like that.
You're supposed to encourage. Can't you be supportive?
-Stop laughing. -You're getting your swagger back.
-That's the Yi Lin I know. -What?
I want you to come here at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow.
What is it, a job?
-Don't be late this time. -Wait a minute!
I don't want to go.
That's the weak me.
Honestly, I'm scared of failing.
Huh? There's something written.
Go get 'em, Sis!
Lu Lu...
We were expecting you.
This way.
What's this about?
-Sis! -Lu Lu!
Did I surprise you?
-The show's starting, so get dressed. -It's too sudden. I can't.
It'll be all right. Come now.
Wait a minute...
Which one is the older sister?
This dress...
It's my favorite color.
You remembered.
Lu Lu made it just for me.
Steve reached out to the people he knew.
You said you're not my manager anymore.
But I'm still your friend.
Thank you.
Lu Lu...
What I see from here...
I don't want to lose it. It's so dear to me.
I don't care if I embarrass myself.
I'm not letting it go.
After that, I finished school and started making clothes for a living.
Sis seems to be enjoying herself more, doing what she wants.
I make the clothes and she wears them.
Just by ourselves, we have our own little fashion show.
"A LITTLE FASHION SHOW"
Have you ever thought about the future?
FALL 2008 I was asked that question a long time ago.
Why did it cross my mind?
How did I answer?
I don't even remember.
Li Mo, impulsive as always, huh?
When you say you're gonna move out, you move out right away.
Haven't exercised much since graduation. Today's been tough.
-What's the rent here? -100,000 a month.
That's steep. Can you afford it on your salary?
It's only been two years since you started.
This dinky hotel in Shikumen? You plan on building this?
It's urban development. Our firm's reputation is on the line.
Have you ever thought about the client's needs?
You don't see it, do you?
It's time you woke up!
Shut up! Just leave me alone!
I just said to wear warm clothes. It's nothing to get upset over.
Those little things are distracting. I need to focus on work.
I'm leaving the house. Already picked an apartment.
I knew it was childish...
Talk to him...
...but I said it, so I'm going to follow through.
Pan, one box is missing.
Really? I thought we got everything.
-We'll go pick it up tomorrow. -Can't wait.
There are tools I need inside. I've got to start on the blueprint.
This room's got a great view.
Don't open the window, Pan! The wind!
Wow, you can see Shikumen from here!
Some parts haven't been demolished. Your grandma still lives there, right?
When we were kids, that place was like a huge maze.
From here, it's just a blotch.
Leave the nostalgia for later and give me a hand here.
This is from the high school exam prep...
This is a tape from Xiao Yu. You still had it?
What do you mean? What's it doing in here?
You were studying like crazy for the exam.
Xiao Yu asked me to give it to you.
It was kind of awkward, so I gave it to your mother.
You didn't know?
Do you have a cassette player?
Do you know what year it is? Of course I don't have one.
Over there.
Hey, where are you going?
What're you gonna do with this stuff?
If it wasn't the end, please let me hear it.
The love I shut out, the dream I chased...
Back then, you and me, we had it all.
Has too much time passed? Is it too late to ask for
Has too much time passed? Is it too late to ask for something other than a goodbye?
If you're not here, my heart will still ache tomorrow.
It's under construction. Watch your step.
Hello, ma'am.
How are the glasses, sir?
Oh, hi, Xiao Yu.
They're great. I can read the newspaper better.
Great to hear.
I got some flower seeds. I'll bring them next time.
Pan, play Xiao Yu's tape first.
There's no "ladies first" among friends.
-You idiot-- -Stop, you two. Let's listen to the song.
Give me one, too, Xiao Yu.
I knew Xiao Yu liked Li Mo.
You're such an idiot, Pan.
Why are you getting so worked up?
I guess I was right.
Xiao Yu likes Li Mo!
Xiao Yu likes Li Mo!
Xiao Yu likes Li Mo!
I'm going to beat you up. Seriously.
The tape!
-This is beyond fixing. -It's punishment from above.
-What'd you say? -Calm down. Let's listen to mine.
Going home already, Xiao Yu? Why don't you eat dinner with us?
Thank you, but there's a test tomorrow. I have to study.
Such a good girl.
Why don't you walk her home?
Grandpa! You sound like Pan.
Xiao Yu!
So much development going on around here. Yeah.
-The road's cracked and they don't fix it. -True.
You can drop me off here. I can walk.
When I put you down earlier, you were like, "Ow, ow!"
Shut up!
I was saying it for your sake.
Stop, it hurts.
Just stay on! It's dangerous.
Hold on tight or you'll fall!
Will you be able to go to school with that leg?
If I can't go, can you record the lesson in class?
On this tape.
Say something funny, too. I'll listen to it over and over.
Sure, if it makes you happy.
Wow, can't wait! But maybe you'll be distracted in class.
Will you shut up?
Oh, hi, Li Mo.
This is from the class. Please give it to Xiao Yu.
Get well soon so you can go back to school.
Okay.
Can you hear me, Xiao Yu?
Look at the second line on page six.
Li Mo! What are you mumbling about?
What're you doing with a recorder?
If you want to sing, come up front.
I can explain...
Hey! Is your leg all right?
Yeah, thanks for your help. I recorded something, too.
Hey... have you thought about the future?
Where you're going to be, what you'll be doing?
I have. I'm going to build a house big enough for all of us.
Pan on the first floor, me on the second, and you on the third.
We'll listen to songs together, even when we're adults.
I never thought about it myself, so I wanted to ask you.
That's... not bad.
What's your favorite color?
I guess... red. It seems warm.
Favorite flower?
Sunflowers, 'cause they grow towards the sun.
Who is... your favorite person?
Li Mo, listen...
I'm taking the exam for Yangpu University Affiliate High School.
Are you serious about going to Yangpu? That's a super-elite school.
You've never mentioned it.
You can go to Yangpu University on merit from the high school.
My father insists I go.
Just because your parents tell you...
But it's far. How would you get there?
Well...
I'd have to move.
Xiao Yu...
What do you want to do?
I... don't want to move. But...
But you'll do what your parents say?
Go ahead then!
Where are you going? We're not done here!
What's wrong, Li Mo? You're not hungry?
Did something happen at school? Your studies must be hard.
Here, eat some meat. You need nutrients.
Mother, don't be so soft on him. It's not like he's aiming that high.
How about Xiao Yu? Where does she want to go?
Yangpu University Affiliate.
Knowing her, that's not surprising.
She was always smart.
You should be more like her.
I'm going to shoot for Yangpu, too.
Are you serious? With your grades, that's almost impossible.
And it's far. How are you going to get there?
You're not just saying this, are you?
I'm serious! I'll go to the high school, and then on to Yangpu University!
If you're serious, it may work out.
Work out?
A friend told me there's an opening for an apartment in Yangpu District.
This area might be demolished,
so it may be a good opportunity to leave Shikumen.
Li Mo, give your best and don't regret it.
Clean your room and focus on your studies.
If you want to pass, there's no time to goof around.
Here is your tape.
There's nothing to record anymore.
Good luck on your exam.
Which school are you going to apply to?
A school close by, like everyone else.
Are you not going to say anything?
Yeah, it would be embarrassing if I failed.
If you say one word, our friendship is over.
That's crazy. You're out of your mind.
Just because Xiao Yu is taking the test
you're reaching too high to be her match.
It's not like that. I just want to prove what I can do.
What did you just say? Wait!
Studying is important, but so is rest.
Don't burn yourself out. And...
Grandpa and Grandma are staying. So it'll only be us three moving.
And Pan asked me to give this tape to you.
He wants you to listen to it.
I don't have time. Put it in a box there.
What's the matter, Li Mo? What's the rush?
I need the cassette player.
I'm by myself, so I don't cook that much anymore.
It's okay. Don't worry about it, Grandma.
Are you hungry? Do you want some cookies?
They're demolishing this area, right?
Did you talk to Dad about it?
They started knocking down that side of the street but stopped here.
It doesn't look like they'll restart any time soon,
so it's hard for me to leave.
Hey! Xiao Yu!
Are you home?
Be quiet. Xiao Yu is not home.
Last night was so crazy I couldn't sleep. Give me a break already.
Not home? What happened last night?
You are an embarrassment!
It seems Xiao Yu failed the test.
Her father was so upset about it.
He got violent, and she was taken to the hospital.
Police came, and it was such a mess...
ACCEPTANCE LETTER
Moving day came without seeing her.
Leaving home... and Grandma and Grandpa.
Life in a new town will soon begin.
Xiao Yu... It was school you were supposed to go to.
What happened?
I can't help... thinking about you.
Looking at the sky above, after the rain.
Xiao Yu, let's sit and eat. Okay.
You're quite an adult now, Xiao Yu.
It's been a while since you three met.
This calls for a celebration! I hear you!
Let's drink, Li Mo.
You're in high school.
And it's still midday!
We each went to different high schools.
We were once inseparable.
Now we can't communicate.
Unlike before, we don't know what to say.
You already have a CD player.
So does everyone else at school.
The sound's bad on tape.
I guess so... No more tapes...
That tape... you listened to it, right?
It's embarrassing, so can you throw it away?
A tape? What are you talking about?
No... it's nothing.
I'll be okay from here.
Go back to everyone else.
It's all right, I'll walk you home.
We walked this road so many times,
I won't get lost.
I guess you're right.
Li Mo,
is it true that you chose that school because of me?
Why do you say that?
I just wanted to prove to my parents I could do it.
It had nothing to do with you.
Oh, okay.
Pan said it was because of me.
Don't be silly. You can't believe what he says.
I guess not. Okay.
I'm gonna go now.
We were too late to send her off.
Gosh, when is it going to move?
She could've told us about going to America to study.
I thought we were friends.
Excuse me, can you stop smoking? It's smoky in the back...
Hey, Li Mo, don't play in the basketball game next week.
You're still injured. Don't be reckless.
I'll tell your mom if you don't listen to me.
I'll do what I want.
I don't care what other people say, is that bad?
Reckless or not, I'm going to believe in myself.
You said you liked sunflowers, right?
I want to face the sun and grow, too.
I don't want to give up.
I'm not gonna make excuses to my future self and regret it.
Then... don't erase this tape, okay?
When we grow up, let's listen to it together.
I... thought about it.
I want to grow like a sunflower, too.
I don't want to have regrets.
That's why I won't go to Yangpu University Affiliate High School.
Because... I don't want to be without you.
I can't rewind time.
I was too childish.
I didn't know...
as if burning the heart alive,
the twisting pain I inflicted on you.
Why didn't I... listen to your voice?
If I ever have a chance to see you again...
the dream we had...
I still want it for us.
Clinging to it...
praying...
Please watch your step.
Shikumen is like an antique, and the stairs are narrow.
You forgot the room key, Pan.
Welcome, do you have a reservation?
Li Mo! Xiao Yu! Hurry up!
Pan, don't run off by yourself!
He hasn't changed a bit.
Xiao Yu, wanna sit next to me?
You're over there!
Look how close the planes are.
Wow, you're right!
-I'm glad it's sunny today. -Yeah.
The flight to Guangzhou departing at 11:45 is now boarding...
Laughter and tears, weaved into a song. What kind of story will it tell?
From the standstill of yesterday,
guiding our spirits toward the future,
-Bonsoir. -Bonsoir.
-How are you adjusting? -Better.
-How are you adjusting? -Better. Good.
Congratulations, de la Torre. -She’s a very lucky woman. -Not as much as I am.
-She’s a very lucky woman. -Not as much as I am.
Monsignor. A pleasure seeing you.
Your father would be proud. It’s what he wanted for you.
Your father would be proud. It’s what he wanted for you. I would like to think so.
Don Felipe, always a pleasure seeing you.
You should come by the house.
I have some new cigars I think you’ll enjoy.
You don’t say.
Excuse me.
Ignacio.
Carmen, it turned out exquisite.
I’m glad you came, Ignacio.
Amada is waiting for you.
Modest.
It belonged to Ignacio’s mother.
Poor woman.
If only she knew where it would end up.
On your sister’s hand, Luz.
Half sister.
Don’t worry. You too will soon find husbands.
Sure.
I hope he is a foreigner.
Like Romain.
Lorenza and Romain.
Will you excuse me?
Ladies.
I hope you have no objection to me stealing Amanda.
Just in time.
And to think, in my hometown, all I wanted was a little sister.
You look lovely.
Félix!
Ignacio.
I knew something was missing from this party.
Mr. President, I apologize for being late.
Félix.
So effusive, as always.
Congratulations, Ignacio.
I heard you finally got appointed to Congress.
What a nice wedding present.
No doubt that Mr. President is quite generous.
Only to the deserving.
Thank you for your trust, Mr. President.
What is given can also be taken away.
So you better honor your part of the deal.
To make my daughter happy.
That’s all I want in life.
But Villada is one of the president’s men.
And now, so am I.
Does Díaz know about this?
I wanted to consult with you first.
If he found out, he’d consider it treason.
Do you…
or do you not want to replace Villada?
Of course.
But why with you?
If the president were to change the official candidate…
who else would he choose?
Perhaps my memory is failing me, but I don’t think I’ve seen you before.
I just started here.
Evaristo Rivas.
Ignacio de la Torre. -Nice to meet you. -Likewise.
-Nice to meet you. -Likewise.
Do you usually stay here so late?
A bad habit.
One I share.
May your union be fertile.
May the both of you see your children’s children,
and after a happy old age, may you arrive at the pearly gates
and after a happy old age, may you arrive at the pearly gates to be met by Jesus Christ, our Lord.
to be met by Jesus Christ, our Lord.
Amen.
It’s almost a miracle everything turned out so well.
The dance floor was crowded when we left.
Even Luz congratulated me.
The Limantours left early.
I hope it wasn’t because of the food.
Don’t you think we’ve toasted enough?
It’s never enough.
This is Dolores, your personal maid.
Socorro and Francisca are the two other maids.
Doña Gertrudis, the cook.
Marco is the valet.
Doroteo,
Francisco, Roberto, Aníbal…
and Lucas.
Isidro is the cook’s assistant, as is Juan.
And Mateo is the stable boy.
I was about to leave, and…
I thought you might want a drink.
I was going to work for my father, but that wasn’t going to end well.
So I came here instead.
Is your whole family still in San Luis?
Let’s say that the distance does us good.
When my father was alive…
I volunteered to visit the estates.
The farther the better.
“The farther the better.”
And what does Mrs. Rivas think?
There isn’t one.
Waiting for the right one?
And waste my time?
-Yes? -Mr. Congressman.
I was about to leave. Do you need anything else?
No, thanks. You can go and rest now.
-If I may? -It’s okay.
You were playing well.
You need to relax your wrists.
So your fingers fall on the keys with their own weight.
I may not know how to play piano,
but I bet you don’t know another woman who can clean, load, and set up a rifle.
Luckily.
What were you doing up so late?
I was waiting for you.
I don’t like you losing sleep on my account.
It’s the only way to see you.
Amada, it’s not proper for you to be like this in the living room.
Everyone’s asleep.
I haven’t finished my work for today.
-Can it wait till tomorrow? -It’s for your father.
Senator Téllez.
-After you, please. -Always so kind.
A box of El Buen Tono, please.
Good luck in the session tomorrow.
Wow. The nation’s son-in-law honors us with his presence.
Show some respect, please.
Ignacio.
My dear.
Mr. de la Torre!
Tell your wife we ladies all loved her dress.
It was divine.
-Who made it? -Enough.
-I’ll get you the tailor’s name later. -No, don’t give her any ideas.
Good evening.
-Good evening. -Good evening.
How’s married life?
Some duties are more difficult than others.
I met someone who could fit in well here.
Let me guess. You’ve already invited him.
Ignacio.
What do we have rules for?
For everyone else.
Nacho.
If you ever do this again,
-I’ll kick you out. -“I’ll kick you out.”
Listen, gentlemen. Who will--
I’m an old fox!
Thank you, Doctor.
Some rest will take your anxiety away.
She won’t forgive me for not inviting her to the wedding.
Dad and Carmelita didn’t let me.
Even though everyone knows she’s Indigenous.
How long has it been since you’ve seen her?
Six years.
Ignacio…
You and Dad are all I have.
Rest up.
You must take off your shirt.
Excuse me?
You may still leave if you wish.
Evaristo Rivas.
Have you come of your own free will?
Yes.
And do you know what unites us in brotherhood?
Socratic love.
And do you, Evaristo Rivas, confess to being eligible to join our society?
I do.
I’m a queer.
Do you swear to keep secret what occurs here, even under pressure?
I do.
Evaristo,
welcome to the Club of, now, the 42!
welcome to the Club of, now, the 42! Welcome!
Gentlemen, let’s raise our glasses to our newest member.
Cheers!
I’ve never seen so many queers in one place.
I knew you’d appreciate it.
Did you go through this as well?
Who introduced you?
Don Felipe.
He was a close friend of my parents.
He invited me as a present for my 18th birthday.
Maximilian passed on the club to him before he was executed.
You’ll love it.
That’s Aristeo.
He’s the only founder left, but unfortunately, he rarely comes now.
Cheers!
Those two are senators.
That one is Agustin.
The newest member until you arrived.
Gabriel introduced him. They both like to wear women’s clothing.
Carlos is a board member of the Bank of London.
He’s a very interesting guy but sometimes a bit complicated.
Gustavo is a bit of an introvert, but he’s great.
And you’ve already met Rafael.
-Welcome. -Thank you.
-Where were you? -My dinner ran late.
-With whom? -Friends.
-You left me worried. -I’m sorry.
I didn’t have time to let you know.
I sent a message to Dad’s house.
They’re looking for you.
Why did you do that?
You didn’t show up. I assumed something terrible happened to you.
Next time, don’t worry so much about me.
I wouldn’t want you to faint again.
What’s going on here?
These gentlemen are asking for you.
Excuse us, sir. We were told something had happened to you.
-Well, now you see I’m okay. -We apologize.
-It’s a beautiful apology. -Do you accept it?
Wouldn’t it look better with a bracelet?
Maybe a pair of earrings?
If something was to happen for real,
at least we can count on my dad.
What a relief.
Did you think I wouldn’t find out?
Pardon me?
You’re conspiring against me.
Mr. President, I wouldn’t even try.
Then what do you call going behind my back to promote an agenda I oppose?
It’s no secret the ranchers are displeased with Villada.
They think I could defend their interests better because I share them.
And they suppose I’ll support you.
Are they mistaken?
You don’t even meet the criteria to be governor.
You need to grow up.
You’ve never hesitated to adjust the law to benefit the people, Mr. President.
How is my daughter?
Happy.
As always.
This conversation is over until you reach the legal age.
-Mr. President-- -Ignacio!
De la Torre. It’s your turn.
My wife wants to have a little suit made for him.
But I don’t think it’s a good gift for a boy.
He won’t be excited about it.
-How old is he now? -Ten.
A bicycle.
-Aren’t they dangerous? -They’re terrible.
On cobblestones, you get jostled around so much you could die.
I think there’s a new model with inflatable tires.
What will they invent next?
Well, if that’s true, I’ll buy him a bicycle.
And have the suit made too to avoid problems with my wife, right?
How modern of you!
I don’t mean the tires, but for giving in to Carolina so much.
When you’re part of a family, you have to compromise.
That’s something you’ll never understand.
Do you live here?
Since I was kicked out of my house.
You need to go out. Meet more people.
I think you’re in the right place.
Do you want to have fun?
Gentlemen, I sincerely apologize for having to leave you like this.
One more. A rematch.
And you?
Can’t even say hi?
How are you, Mr. Congressman?
I thought we had a deal.
And I thought you had more important things to do.
Ignacio.
-Stay a little longer. -No, it’s late.
He likes to ride his mare in the mornings.
Come with me.
Eva.
Eva.
Put the chair in front of the mirror and the candle closer to the bed.
Ignacio.
What are you doing?
I don’t want you staying up because of me.
Please don’t change rooms.
We haven’t even been married for a year.
The doctor said you need to sleep well.
Did I do something wrong?
-Something that bothered you? -No.
Nothing.
This is a better arrangement.
For your health.
They agreed to leave us alone in the box.
When he gave me the ring, all the audience clapped.
I want a story like that!
There are plenty of stories like that. The problem is what comes next.
And how is it, Amada?
What comes next.
Well, I can’t complain.
The other day, Ignacio gave me a diamond necklace.
I couldn’t say no.
Has he had more dinners that last until the next day?
Luz.
Don’t be so thoughtless.
No, Luz.
No, no more long dinners.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts, dear.
These things disappear when you least expect.
One day, you’re his sun,
and the next, he’s gone to get warmed up in another place.
Isn’t that right, Carmelita?
-Elena, would you like a glass of water? -No.
-Anyone else? -No, thanks.
What a good time, right?
Did you like the gift I sent?
I didn’t think you would get so many signatures.
Now we’re just missing the most important one.
Álvaro, Manuel.
I want an in-depth report on this boy’s political viability.
Of course, Mr. President.
Thank you.
It’s not a “yes,” Ignacio.
It’s a “we’ll see.”
Excuse me.
What position?
Governor of the State of Mexico.
You have dishonored the woman.
En garde!
What a tragic penetration.
He had gonorrhea!
Since you’re all here, I would like to announce
Since you’re all here, I would like to announce that the annual ball will take place on November 17th.
that the annual ball will take place on November 17th.
In the immensity
Of the waves, floating, I saw you
And going to save you
The whole thumb, I stuck in
Your sweet vision Eternally engraved on my soul…
Your sweet vision Eternally engraved on my soul… -I like that. I liked it. -You are tired.
-I like that. I liked it. -You are tired.
Ladies, I think I’m going to turn in now. Party pooper!
Party pooper! -But why, Nachito? -I have to plan my campaign for governor.
-But why, Nachito? -I have to plan my campaign for governor.
-Of what? -What else? Of Sodom!
-Of the State of Mexico. -Even worse.
I think you could become president, Nachito.
Evaristo would be the First Lady.
-Indeed! I like that. -Miss Blondie de la Torre.
Gentlemen, can you imagine?
Our next orgy could be at the Chapultepec Castle.
Yes! I’ll wrap myself in the flag. -Ignacio de la Torre for governor! -Long live Nacho!
-Ignacio de la Torre for governor! -Long live Nacho! Shut up already!
Mr. de la Torre!
Don’t forget about your girls when setting up your cabinet.
Hey.
That’s what you get for encouraging them.
What’s going on, Félix?
People like to talk, Amada.
I AWOKE WITH THE SHIVERING OF YOUR KISSES ON MY BACK. EVA
I’m new at the bureau. They treat me very well.
My husband treats you very well?
Well, actually, I work with various senators, and…
I invited Eva to spend the evening with us.
You’ve been reading my mail.
You leave me no other option.
-I should come back some other time. -Sit down.
My husband is exhausted from working so much.
You must know better than I.
I was telling Amada about the work I do as your lawyer.
-Eva and I were talking about spending-- -It’s Mr. Rivas, Amada.
Talk properly. You’re not in your village.
Do you mind me calling you Eva?
No.
Eva and I talked about spending Saturday in the country.
I don’t think Mr. Rivas can.
He’s very busy with some contracts.
-I thought it was a bill. -That too.
Why did you come?
Because the invitation was in your name. “Mr. and Mrs. Ignacio de la Torre.”
Please, don’t come again.
Give it to me.
I won’t ask again.
Give it to me.
I’m not stupid enough to keep them there.
Amada!
Amada, what are you doing up there?
Amada!
Leave me alone!
Don’t slip.
Since when do you care what happens to me?
Get in the house.
You, go away!
Amada!
Go away!
Ignacio, you have to give me a child.
If you don’t, I’ll share what I know.
What will they say about you?
We’re married, Amada.
The least you can do is keep up appearances.
For me.
Doesn’t everyone think we’re…
deeply in love?
He probably won’t come today either.
Evaristo, it isn’t wise to behave like this.
Like husband and wife.
It won’t end well.
COME BACK, I MISS YOU. EVA
I’m afraid the electorate doesn’t have the best opinion of you.
I’m sure you can find a more favorable sample.
With all due respect, Mr. Congressman, your lifestyle is the talk of the town.
How do I know the results are not biased?
Because I guarantee it.
Who do you think advised the president on his last three reelections?
I advise you not to run.
You have no chance of winning.
And the general doesn’t like to lose.
Doña Carmen, Mr. President.
Ignacio.
I’m glad you could find the time.
-Did Álvaro and Manuel deliver the report? -Porfirio. Not now.
Not yet.
There will be time to talk about these issues over dinner.
…duality a little extreme.
-It was a bit more restrained. -Yes, not like now.
Now it seems like social encounters like this are much lighter.
Now it seems like social encounters like this are much lighter. Yes.
-More enjoyable. -More relaxed.
What a lovely house.
Thank you, Carmen. A pleasure to have you with us.
Red snapper with ravigote sauce, Dad.
Just how you like it.
Look at you.
Soon you’ll teach Luz how to be a good hostess.
It’s a little dry.
It’s delicious.
All you need now is to be a mother.
Porfirio.
What?
I can’t say that?
I want grandchildren.
How long have you been together?
-Ignacio. -We’re working on it.
That’s what I wanted to hear.
Did you know where the term “ravigote” comes from?
-No. -From French.
It means “vigor.”
This sauce invigorates the diners’ appetites
from its making to the time of ingestion.
How are you today?
What are you doing here?
A wife can’t visit her husband?
What are you doing?
I’ll cure you.
God free you of your sin…
Touch me again, and I’ll have you locked up in an asylum.
I’m not afraid of you. I was born in a battlefield.
Get out.
Not until you give me a child.
Let go of me!
Ignacio, give me a child.
Ignacio.
Amada, open up.
It’s for your own good.
Amada, open up.
Amada! Open up.
Open up!
Amada!
What is it, my daughter?
I’m worried about Ignacio, Dad.
Whatever you need, Amada.
-What’s wrong? -I’m being followed.
-By whom? -I don’t know, but I know who sent them.
Were you followed?
No. No, I don’t think so.
Let’s get out of here.
Where?
Out of the country.
That’s crazy.
I know.
We were starting to worry about you, Nachito.
-What is this? -Your new bodyguards.
-I don’t need them. -That’s not your decision.
Very well.
-So have them watch over Amada. -No.
They’re for you.
You don’t have the authority.
You’re mistaken, Ignacio.
I have all the authority.
And if you don’t like it, speak to the president,
Nachito.
Have them keep watch outside, Teo. They can’t be here.
Thank you, Teo.
-Who is it from? -Amada, this is unbearable.
Who is it from?
The tailor.
-They’re pressuring us, sir. -I get that, but what do they want?
A meeting with you.
No, I can’t. Tell them--
Mr. Congressman?
Tell them I have postponed running until the next cycle.
There we go.
You look gorgeous.
Turn around.
There we go.
You’ll look gorgeous in this dress.
Forty-two tickets, only one winner.
Who’s feeling lucky today?
-Whose idea was this? How great. -Midnight raffle!
One ticket per person. Don’t be greedy.
You look beautiful.
Forty-two tickets, only one winner.
May I?
You want one?
-Me, please! -Midnight raffle!
The train leaves at seven.
Shall we?
-Good evening. -Good evening.
Thanks.
Cheers.
What is it?
There was a raid on a party on La Paz Street.
At first, it seemed normal, but then I realized there were only men.
Get to the point, Félix.
Those who seemed to be women were men in dresses.
We arrested 42, sir.
I only see 41.
My son will find out.
My son will find out.
I’m going to die.
My son will find out, and I’m going to die.
Get this faggot out of here.
-Pigs! -Get out of here, sickos!
Those here are an example of the putrefaction
Those here are an example of the putrefaction that must be eradicated from our society.
May the lesson of these sick men serve as an example
May the lesson of these sick men serve as an example for all those who seek to go against the principles of morality.
for all those who seek to go against the principles of morality.
Let it be clear.
Rotten weeds will be uprooted without any hesitation.
For the good of our society and the safety of our families.
I asked my dad to let you stay at home.
Did you tell your dad about Evaristo?
What for?
God sees all.
Amada, please.
If you help me get Evaristo out of jail, I promise--
He was sent to Yucatán.
At least he can atone for his sins.
Mr. Congressman.
The president wants to know if he can count on your vote on the floor.
Tell him he can.
La bohème is opening at Teatro Principal.
Can we go?
If you want.
Or would you rather go to Tacubaya for the weekend?
Ignacio.
Sorry, what?
Would you rather go to the opera or the summerhouse?
I don’t care.
Evaristo died.
I don’t know anything else. I just know he died.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
I'm almost there.
Then fucking wait.
Yes, wait for me.
Turn on, goddamnit!
Taxi!
Taxi!
MONDAY
Jimena.
He's here.
What a weekend.
My wife's insane.
Take note: if you haven't married yet, don't.
It's the biggest rip-off in history.
Couldn't wait to get here, family.
-So peaceful here. -Cesar, we should start.
What's the rush?
Calling me all weekend.
It's serious. -We have a serious... -One moment.
Sorry, Javier.
False-alarm stomach cramp.
Where were we?
We got a tip from Frankfurt. The assets are going haywire,
We got a tip from Frankfurt. The assets are going haywire, thanks to the new European directive.
Problem is, the rumor has spread. Get to the point, Javier.
We're fucked, César.
The market opened under an hour ago, and we're down six points.
Six points?
What the hell are you...?
-Why didn't you tell me? -I've been calling for two days.
-If we go lower than ten... -They suspend trading.
It fucks our loan negotiation. The shareholder meeting is Saturday.
-And that's not the worst. -It's not?
-What's the worst? -The IRS.
-The IRS too? Fuck! -They denied the appeal.
We pay this week, or they confiscate. Goddamit!
So what were you doing to avoid all this?
Gomez,
do you care about our conversation?
I was looking at our stocks.
What have you been doing?
What the fuck has Gomez done to avoid this fucking disaster?
-I was gone all weekend. -Nothing, I'm telling you.
Because he's useless.
All he knows how to do is kiss my ass.
I pay you to fix shit like this.
You didn't fix anything, you asshole.
I think this reprimand is unwarranted. I've been here for years...
-You're fired. Get out! -No!
Get out! To the fucking curb!
-Please! -Let's go! -What are you doing? -Please, no! No, no!
-What are you doing? -Please, no! No, no!
Let go of the knob!
Let go, or I'll chop your hand off! Let go, you faggot!
If I bring this to the shareholders, they'll kill me.
If I bring this to the shareholders, they'll kill me. We've got a week, until Saturday.
We've got a week, until Saturday.
Let's collect on all debts, even the slightest.
We can suspend supplier payment. And cut it off, -if it's not profitable. -Exactly.
-if it's not profitable. -Exactly. Campaigns and foundations. Forget about the new building.
Campaigns and foundations. Forget about the new building.
And we have to cut staff, Cesar.
No, we're the ones who fucked up. No layoffs.
We're the only company who hasn't since the crisis, -and we should. -I won't fucking do it!
-and we should. -I won't fucking do it!
The crisis. The crisis, I'll fuck that crisis up.
The crisis, I'll fuck that crisis up.
We're a family.
We'll fight together like a family.
We're giving up dividends, all of us.
-Come on! -I need that money.
It's a good idea.
We'll use the capital to repurchase shares.
We'll stop the hemorrhage, regain shareholder trust.
I'm not leaving this office until the company's safe.
Shoot up caffeine, if you must.
You know what to do. Get out there, and do it.
Now, goddamnit!
What a plan, huh?
Yeah, I know. I went too far with Gomez?
A little.
I had a rough weekend.
Really rough.
Huge fucking blowout with Laura.
And my kidney is killing me.
I was at the new club, the one the Germans recommended.
I was there two days, I couldn't answer calls. I didn't look at my phone.
I was with a Russian...
She could be Miss World, I swear.
She does house calls, too, I've got her number.
Not necessary, Cesar.
For an emergency. Just in case.
Gomez, Gomez, Gomez...
-Come on, forgive me. -No.
You forgive me.
It's fine.
But be strong now. United, like a team.
OK?
Go get them!
I hope you know I love you, man.
Don't think I'm homophobic, either.
Sorry?
I was just mad, I don't care that you're gay.
But I'm not gay.
You aren't gay?
You're not gay?
Maybe you're lying to yourself.
No, really. I like women.
Better for you, that's great.
Gomez! Don't slack off!
Yes, sir.
A message for you.
I'm going home, you take it.
They say it's personal.
Send them in.
-What the fuck? -Cesar, I'm done. We're over.
You're not allowed in the house. I changed the locks and the combo.
Here, your clothes.
-Your other stuff... -Hang on.
What's all this? Who are you?
Your wife sent me.
I'm with Messengers for You, a bad news communication agency.
If you need to fire, sue, or break up with someone,
-we do it for you. -Dumb job, huh?
I've got two degrees, don't be rude. Then you're twice as dumb.
May I continue?
I'll send your other things. Don't come over, I'll call the police.
I'll send your other things. Don't come over, I'll call the police. Don't go to my house? It's Diego's birthday.
Don't go to my house? It's Diego's birthday.
If you call, or try to get close to Diego, I'll call the police.
Don't sick more PIs on me, either.
All this, I'll use it in the divorce suit,
for a restraining order and for my alimony.
It was just one argument of many. Now she wants a divorce?
It was just one argument of many. Now she wants a divorce? Not just an argument.
I've been warning you for years. You never listen.
I get kicked out by messenger, but I don't listen?
You forgot Diego's present, for a change.
I didn't forget. He wanted a ball signed by the Barça.
You think finding it was easy?
You shouldn't promise if you can't find it. But since you don't care...
I don't care about my son?
Fine.
-A message from me. Write it down. -I wasn't paid for a response.
Tell her...
Write it down!
Tell her to forget the house and my money.
-And if she insists, she'll be very sorry. -Very sorry.
Say it like you mean it.
Like a man, make her cry.
-I'll sing it to her for another fifty. -Get out!
-Ariana. -Mr. Garrido.
Late again.
-Ten minutes. -Thirteen.
Yesterday, you didn't clock my extra hour.
I'll give you another shot. You still haven't been here long.
But you know we value punctuality, right?
Yes, Mr. Garrido.
I've been doing this for years. I can read people.
I don't know you well,
but I believe in you,
so I'll help you.
But you have to trust me, come to me with your problems. In my office.
Other girls never come talk to me.
They won't let me help them,
then their problems get worse.
Her severance.
You understand, right?
Yes, sir. Understood. Excuse me.
Wait.
That's better.
Yes, sir.
Diego, it's Dad. Call me, pick up the phone.
All this social media, but you suck at communication.
Anyway,
I want to say happy birthday, OK?
I didn't forget!
I love you.
Jimena!
-Jimena! -Yes?
Go home.
-Not until you do. -I'm staying late, don't worry.
-Not until you do. -I'm staying late, don't worry. -Go. -Yeah, but I...
Go the fuck home! Did I stutter?
God!
Yes?
It's Teresa, from security.
There's a woman here, she looks odd, and says she's here for you.
-She's here for an interview. -At this time of night?
Yes, this time of night. Send her up.
You released my panther, and it ate your heart.
Ay, ay, ay, you've got it.
Garrido, to my office. Now!
Come in, Garrido.
What's wrong? Not so cocky now?
Because now I'm the one who's in charge.
And you know what? You're fired.
Why? Because I can.
You're going to cry?
Fine, you get another chance, because I believe in you.
But first you have to eat my pussy.
You heard me. You have to eat it all out, you might like being forced.
That's what you wanted before, a blowjob.
Hi, Mom? It's Ariana, calling from Spain.
I couldn't call before.
Mom, you need to learn to do video calls, it's spendy for me to use the phone.
Yes, it's a nice office.
Yeah, they treat me well.
Don't worry, I'll send you money this week.
Yes, I've got enough for myself.
Is the kid around?
Can I say hi?
Hi, sweetie.
How are you?
It's so nice to hear your voice.
I'm not in Colombia, I'm in Spain.
Soon.
I'm looking for a cheap ticket for Christmas.
How's school?
So glad to hear that.
You know I love you lots?
So, so much.
Yeah. And I really miss you.
I've got to go now, but I'll call again soon.
I'm still here.
Me, too, sweetheart.
Me, too. So much.
Yes. I promise.
To infinity and beyond.
Yes, sweetheart.
OK, buddy. Bye.
Bye-bye.
Sorry!
It's just this is my office, so... Hey, listen, I'm not...
You forgot this.
Good morning.
Who hires the cleaning?
It's subcontracted.
Call them. Tell them to sack Garrido if they want to renew.
Tell them.
They can talk to me, if they want. If they've got the balls...
-Should I say balls, too? -Emphasize it.
-Why don't you shower? -Why, do I have a meeting?
It's your image, the one you give your employees.
TUESDAY
Forget the graphics, the press, what the news says. Trust me.
Yes, me.
You changed it.
-I'm fucked, you hear me? -Bring some flan!
Come on, guys, let's give a show!
I'm saying the situation is critical, goddamnit!
What? Don't piss me off, OK?
Come on, Paco!
Paco, Paco!
Now or never, forget about me.
No, man, No.
Paco's the man!
Goddamnit, man!
-Dirty bastard! -I'm sure you've sucked worse things.
Can't you see me, son of a bitch? I'm right here!
Boss, a visitor.
Show them in.
Good afternoon.
She fell apart, right?
Not exactly.
We talked about lots of things. A fascinating woman, really.
If you won't divorce nice, then I'll be nasty.
I'll keep all three cars, two houses and the Paris flat.
I'll turn Diego against you. I'll cut off your balls, hang them on the shelf.
At least she's got style.
-I contributed a bit. -I'll contribute to punching your face.
Let's focus, things are nasty right now.
But we can work it out.
Forget about lawyers and all that stuff.
-What's your offer? -The house and alimony.
Keep the damn flat in Paris. However, Diego stays with me.
Also, I get the old car and the beach house.
I don't think so.
That's my offer. It's final.
You'll hear from my lawyer!
She gave me this for you.
After all these years at the company,
this is how you repay me? I'm suing, I broke my back for you.
What happened? You didn't hear? Garrido got fired.
You didn't hear? Garrido got fired.
I'll sue!
This won't stand!
How long have we been with the company, Javier?
Eighteen years.
When did we start fucking up?
You remember Serafin Lopez?
Of course! That asshole.
-Not an asshole. -A faggot, then.
The first big mistake was firing him.
-He was fucking difficult. -He wasn't difficult.
He said things you didn't want to hear.
Over the years, you've only kept the ass-kissers and idiots.
You fired people who told you the truth.
I didn't fire you.
-God knows why. -Because I don't fucking want to.
You asked when you started fucking up.
I gave you my opinion. Serafin.
-Jimena, go home. -One moment, boss.
I know, don't worry. I'm fine on my own.
That's not it, I wanted to talk to you.
Go the fuck home, Jimena.
Don't you have a life? Go out with your girlfriends.
Go play bingo, get tipsy.
What?
Well, then!
Good evening.
Do you know who I am?
Obviously...
It's my dinner break.
What was your name?
-Teresa. -Teresa.
How's it going down here?
-All in order. -Good.
What are you reading?
Molière.
The playwright. French.
I don't read French stuff. You end up sitting to piss.
Do you know...
the girl who cleans at night? She listens to music, her hair's like this...
-Mexican. -Colombian.
-Mexican. -Colombian. -Yeah, whatever. -Her name's Ariana.
-Yeah, whatever. -Her name's Ariana.
Ariana?
She's new.
I don't think she'll last long, she's nice.
-Why's that? -Nice girls don't last.
Life is constant frustration.
A slow anticipation of death.
You smoke pot on the job?
You want to bang her?
You want to bang her.
I want to talk to her.
So you can bang her.
You know where she is now?
I'd guess on the third or fourth.
Hit that button there.
That one.
Again. Again.
Again.
That's it.
Some wine?
I'm working.
To make up for scaring you yesterday.
You been here long?
One month.
And in Spain?
Five years.
But I switch jobs a lot.
Not a good way to get references.
No one asks for references. They want twelve-hour shifts for 700 euros.
Tastes good.
I've got a son, too.
Teenager, a Barça fan.
Punishment for something in a past life, I guess.
Garrido got fired.
My boss. You know anything about that? Who's Garrido?
Right. -What, did you like him? -No, no.
-What, did you like him? -No, no.
Then let's celebrate, right?
Cheers.
You forgot this yesterday.
You like snooping?
You too, right? Observing without being observed.
Look at that.
I was going to fire you, but on second thought...
People don't keep much at new offices.
But they let their guard down with time.
I've seen it all.
Dirty magazines!
Let me see.
They're ass-kisser Gomez's.
Poor guy's so dumb... But he grows on you. I thought he was a fag.
But he grows on you. I thought he was a fag.
-They're so old! -This is nothing.
If you only knew what women hide.
Like what?
Women's things.
Vibrators?
The sun's coming up, I have to go. Why? You a vampire?
-Put everything back, OK? -At your service.
Will I see you tonight?
I have no choice.
Where's the chocolate, huh?
Where is it?
Where's the chocolate?
Jimena!
WEDNESDAY
Jimena!
Fuck.
Where the hell is Jimena?
On time for three years, today she had to be late.
Follow me.
What's up?
You'll need a roofie if you want to rape me.
Boss.
Forgive me, you are...?
-Pereira, from administration. -You hired her, damnit.
Oh, that's right.
You screwed that fatso from marketing,
at the Christmas party. We all thought he was a fag.
You deserve a trophy just for that.
We're married now.
What better trophy than that? She's here to help us, come on.
She's here to help us, come on. Fine, what's going on?
I've been looking at bills, two years' worth. From all departments.
There's a mess of fake projects, cover departments, to hide transfers,
There's a mess of fake projects, cover departments, to hide transfers, equity transfers.
What do you mean? We're getting robbed?
Someone inside has sent cash to tax havens for years.
Over fifteen million.
Yeah, right. Fifteen million euros?
Fifteen million gets robbed, and you don't notice. Come on!
Are you serious?
-You're serious. -They did it gradually.
During years of plenty. With profits, no one cared.
During years of plenty. With profits, no one cared. -Just minor details. -Details?
-Just minor details. -Details?
Fifteen million euros! Son of a bitch...
God!
Who did it? I'll chop his balls off and make a yoyo.
We're investigating.
They're undeclared accounts.
But there have to be records off the books somewhere.
We have to find them, prove we didn't do it.
-Call the board of administrators. -It's best we keep this secret.
My office, within an hour!
What's going on?
I just discovered one of you has been robbing us.
For years.
I can't report it.
Because if people find out, the company will go to hell.
Javier wants a discreet investigation,
but I'm not a discreet guy.
I piss on my enemy's face.
Understood?
The guilty man,
or woman,
has one chance to fix it.
If you confess,
and return the money, of course,
there won't be repercussions.
I swear on my mother.
Now's the time to talk.
Nothing?
No one wants to talk?
Last chance.
When the company was starting,
you came to me with your shit resumes,
begging for a chance,
and I gave it to you.
I trusted you.
Cesar.
You lived in rented houses.
Now you compete to see who has the biggest pool.
No salaries, no company cards,
no company cars, no fucking free coffee, until I know who did it!
Start snooping on your colleagues, fucking their wives for information.
Do whatever you have to, but I want the guilty guy's head on a stake.
Any questions?
-What's a stake? -Get out of my face!
Good evening.
I'm sorry.
I don't know how it is in your country.
Here we do things one way, in Germany, another.
Now you're saying Tokyo? Wall Street, Tokyo We're in Spain, man.
We could... Why not? Come on.
We could... Why not? Come on. Sure.
Of course. Yeah, sure.
Look what I found.
She's worked for me fifteen years. She has a degree, thanks to me.
Look how she pays me back.
I FUCK THE CRISIS
-I don't know my employees. -Poor little thing.
What?
Imagine your problems if you were a woman.
Don't get feminist on me.
Not even a lesbian could turn me feminist.
I've got women, tons work with me.
-For you. -With me.
How many?
I don't know, a ton.
They're not all hot, either.
Because I respect women. Ugly, fat, old, I don't care. We've got them all.
And women in management?
Don't bust my balls. Everyone's doing it today.
Even my wife wants a divorce.
Really?
I'm so sorry.
Do you love her?
I don't really know.
How did you meet?
Drunk.
We were at the same faculty. Different classes.
I had seen her, I liked her. But I was too shy to talk to her.
I was kind of a bitch then.
There was a Christmas Eve party at the faculty.
Out of control.
I had this cheesy, pathetic tie,
just to draw attention. White, with red kissy lips.
You saw her there?
Yeah. In an evening gown, it was breathtaking.
But the belt on it broke, it was falling off.
So I, ever the gentleman, removed my tie,
and tied it on like a belt.
She said thank you, then I took her home,
and she jumped me at her front door.
She was naughty.
And beautiful.
-Should I stop rambling? -No.
-What about you? -What about me?
-Boyfriend? Husband? -No.
Your kid's father?
He...
He left before he was born.
Better that way.
To children, the best thing in life.
-Even if they hurt. -Cheers.
Cheers.
Want to see something?
Your tits.
Sorry.
Follow me.
How had I not seen this?
No one else has the key. I come here a lot.
Watch your head.
What's wrong?
-Tomorrow's my last day. -What?
There are layoffs, it's my turn.
What the hell...? They're firing you?
I'll talk to them.
I'll speak with them.
Why? It's not necessary. Yes, it is.
A cleaning company needs cleaning ladies.
The country needs fewer bosses, and more workers.
I'm going back home, with my son.
-To Peru? -I'm Colombian.
Why are you leaving?
To take care of my son. It's easier being there.
Stay a few more days, I'll buy you a ticket.
No.
First-class.
-We'll go to a hotel, have a good time. -I said no!
Sorry.
-I have to go. -Hey.
Are you coming to work tomorrow?
So we'll say goodbye...
-Tomorrow? -Yes.
Here, same place?
-Here, same place. -Good.
-See you tomorrow. -Bye.
For the department meeting. The coordinator can handle it.
For the department meeting. The coordinator can handle it. -Did you see what he did? -I'm going to...
-Did you see what he did? -I'm going to... Tell him I said so.
THURSDAY
Excuse me.
I'm listening.
Your wife won't want an agreement. She wants total surrender, no conditions.
I don't get it.
This is over the top.
Something had to happen to make her like this.
Why are you quiet?
Nothing, because...
Because I have nothing to say.
-You know something. -Me? No.
No, no. No, no, no, no.
-I swear. -You know something, I can tell.
-What would I know? Nothing! -Goddamnit!
-Tell me what you know! -She's screwing someone else!
What?
She's having an "affaire."
An "affaire?" What the hell?
-"Affaire" has French roots... -How do you know she has a lover?
-"Affaire" has French roots... -How do you know she has a lover? I don't know, stuff, subtle details.
And there was a naked guy at her house.
Who?
I don't know. But when she opened the door, they were both wearing bathrobes.
Two plus two equals...
Two plus two equals me punching your face.
I want you to know, I'm with you, OK? She really let me down.
As a woman, and as a person, too.
Thanks a lot.
Your support means so much to me.
No worries, I'm here to help. Anything else you need?
Yeah, for you to scram.
-Yeah, but maybe... -Get out!
No, wait.
Tell her if she wants war, she'll have war.
And to get ready to suffer.
To suffer more than me, that's for sure.
She didn't pay me, not for an answer.
Boss, are you OK?
I was doing sit-ups.
Help me up.
We're getting old.
And I've always taken care of myself!
Hand me that bottle.
Come on.
-Have a drink with me. -It's 4 PM.
Fuck, you're right. A drink with a cigar, then.
What's up?
What did you want?
Boss, look...
Spit it out, damn it.
I know I'm not brilliant, I have my limitations.
Yes, you do.
But you know you can trust me. You know how much I value you.
You're part of my life.
You sure you're not gay?
Look,
some of us directors had several drinks yesterday.
People are worried, -because of all that's going on. -I see.
-because of all that's going on. -I see.
So someone started badmouthing you.
-Badmouthing? -That the situation is your fault.
-Badmouthing? -That the situation is your fault. That you should be kicked off the board.
What the fuck? Kick me off?
Said it was the only way to avoid a takeover.
It looks possible with the majority of administrators,
they just have to prove you abandon your post.
They said it would be easy, because lately...
They said it would be easy, because lately... What? Lately what?
What? Lately what?
You drink a lot, and take a lot of... You know.
They can say it to my face if they have the balls.
I'll shove their head up their ass.
Who is that son of a bitch?
-Well, I... -Tell me.
-Fucking tell me! -It's Javier Montero.
Javier?
That's impossible.
-You must've been drunk. -I couldn't believe it, either,
-You must've been drunk. -I couldn't believe it, either, -but he insisted. -No way.
-but he insisted. -No way.
I dodged the issue, said I'd think about it, but this morning,
I dodged the issue, said I'd think about it, but this morning, I got a text from him.
YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DISCUSSED YESTERDAY?
He may have stolen the money.
He had never talked about you this way. He said it was time to attack, you'd never see it coming.
He said it was time to attack, you'd never see it coming.
You never see fatal blows coming.
-Should I talk to him? -No.
No, leave me alone.
Cesar, they won't let me in.
Because I gave orders not to let you in.
You said a director was robbing us, right? Someone who controlled administration.
You thought I wouldn't find out?
That being buddy-buddy would fool me forever?
Wait.
You think I did it?
You want to take my company away.
You son of a bitch!
-Why do you think I did it? -Do you deny it?
Of course I do. Because it's not true.
You know what hurts the most?
After so many years,
you can't say it to my face.
You have to stab me in the back, pitting people against me, like a gossipy hag.
Are you done?
You're done. I never want to fucking see you again.
Get out of here. Get out, you son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Take him out.
It doesn't make sense. He fired his best friend?
They were so close. They made the company together.
Everything nice in life turns to shit.
It's weird that he betrayed him.
Read Shakespeare.
The ones you love the most can fuck you over the most.
Always.
These are so good. Where do you get them?
I'll miss them when you leave.
What's going on there?
They go down to smoke sometimes.
To the garage?
Why is no one smoking?
What are you doing here?
Emptying the trash, what else?
Emptying it where?
Outside.
I'll leave now.
Cesar?
Cesar?
Ari.
What's up?
You need to go empty out your locker with me.
-My shift isn't over yet. -Orders from above.
I'm sorry.
FRIDAY
Son of a bitch.
Makes you want to jump.
Remember the Twin Towers?
People falling...
So peaceful.
Their last seconds of life, and they chose not to fight, just...
to enjoy the flight.
I'll push you, if that's what you want.
I prefer a surprising death. It's more beautiful.
Maybe we're already dead and this is purgatory.
Ariana told me to tell you goodbye from her.
Ariana? When?
Last night.
They made me remove her from the building.
They sacked her.
I knew she wouldn't last. It's all futile, so merciless.
She said this is for you.
What is it?
She said it was the brown-noser's, for you to keep an eye on him.
The brown-noser?
Boss, something wrong?
Javier isn't the thief. You are.
-For how long? -Years.
You're such an idiot,
you left proof in the office.
It's encrypted. No names, no data.
If it were deciphered, we'd have time to move the cash.
We? Who else did it?
Everyone.
The whole Board of Administrators.
All your closest people.
Everyone, except Javier.
He's the only one who told us not to vote against you.
You're an idiot, Cesar. Which is why you'll lose the company.
You're an idiot, Cesar. Which is why you'll lose the company. I won't fucking lose it!
This company is mine.
I founded it,
-and I've led it for years. -You don't lead shit.
I don't get it.
I made you rich. Why are you doing this?
You're such an idiot, now I have to explain.
You've insulted me every day I've worked with you.
Do you know how hard it is to shut up, not jump you, bash your head in?
You piece of shit, circus monkey.
You piece of shit, circus monkey. Drug addict.
We've been mocking you for years.
That's the only good part.
Jokes at your expense, chuckling behind your back.
That made it all worth it.
But...
the funniest part.
Even you will laugh.
I'm fucking your wife.
Tomorrow at ten, board meeting,
boss.
Jimena?
It's Laura.
Where's Diego?
Downstairs.
Tell him to come up.
You sure about that?
Gomez.
Really?
You and him?
You're better than that, damn it.
Can't you see he's only doing it to hurt me?
It's all about you.
I get that you hate me. But trust me, he's a snake.
He fooled me for years.
It's not hard to fool you. Just worship you a little bit...
What happened to us?
We loved each other once. I loved a man who doesn't exist anymore.
Gomez is game to buy your shares, for a reasonable price.
I'm happy with half. In Diego's name.
I see. That's why you're here.
-My son comes first. -For me, too.
They're going to recapitalize. Your shares will be worth ten times less.
They can't do that.
Take the offer, or you'll end up with squat.
What's so funny? Gomez is a smart son of a bitch. But not that smart.
Gomez is a smart son of a bitch. But not that smart.
This was your idea.
He thinks he seduced you,
but you're the one behind it all.
Did you start crying in his car?
You told him I was aloof, you needed love?
While you stuck your hand down his fly?
Tomorrow,
accept the offer,
make everything easier.
Please.
Wait.
Where the fuck did I put it?
Let's see...
It's for Diego.
What is it?
The last thing I'll ask you in my life.
Please.
Javier...
Javier, buddy, really,
I am so sorry.
Everything I said and did, I'm sorry. Call me.
Javier!
Javier, please call me.
Call me, for real.
-What are you doing here? -Let me in.
No! Boss, don't do it!
Help me!
Help!
Help!
Help me!
-I've got you! -Lift me up, damn it!
Help me!
Get up!
Grab him, hang on! Come up! Pull!
Come up!
Come up!
That's it.
Let's see...
Thank you.
This is for the pain.
Go get that checked out.
I've been an asshole.
A fucking asshole.
They all saw it, except for me.
They were all laughing at me.
Except for you.
I've met worse.
SATURDAY
Morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's make this quick, please.
Cesar, if you'll allow me, we all know why we're here.
I propose: immediate removal of Cesar as CEO.
One moment.
Cesar, don't make a scene.
You can't remove me.
Of course we can.
No.
Because I'm resigning.
I resign as CEO, and my spot on the board.
I resign as CEO, and my spot on the board. Fine. You've still got some dignity.
Fine. You've still got some dignity. Will you sign, please?
May I have one last word?
Say whatever you want and then fucking disappear.
Actually, the last word is for someone else.
Montero can't be here! You fired him.
-Last night, we sold all our shares. -So?
I sent this report to international agencies,
detailing the company's theft, the one you're behind.
I CC'd the prosecutor and the commission. By the way, it's also leaked to the press.
By the way, it's also leaked to the press.
I'm guessing that Monday morning, the cops will be here with a search warrant.
What the fuck is this, Gomez?
They won't find squat. The money's hidden, and we cooked the books.
-You think we're idiots? -Well, it will take them time.
But you'll all be sentenced.
-That's for sure. -You know the IRS,
it latches on and doesn't let go.
The IRS can suck my dick. You're going down first, you asshole.
No, no.
I may be an asshole, but I didn't steal anything.
Nothing to do with me.
All I regret is not going to the board meeting.
-I'd love to see your faces. -Our faces?
The accounts are tailored, you look like the guilty one.
-It'll be your word against ours. -Not quite.
Say hi to the camera.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Hi, Pereira! You get that all on camera?
-Yes, sir . -So we're good?
-More than good. -Perfect, thank you.
Son of a bitch!
It's already in the news.
Fuck, we have to sell!
You sank your own company.
You never see fatal blows coming.
Good luck.
And thank you.
Thank your son.
Diego?
He called to tell me to give you a chance.
He really did that?
He liked the ball.
Must've been hard to score the autographs.
Why do you think I spent two days at that club?
I'm such a dick.
I don't know why I doubted you.
-I'm a faggot. -What?
What you are is a dumbass...
When do you leave?
First thing tomorrow.
I'll go with you.
Nothing for me here. There must be 1st-class tickets left.
Nothing for me here. There must be 1st-class tickets left. Cesar!
We would've had fun.
-Imagine, tequila all day long. -Which tequila?
Oh, fuck, no, that's Mexico.
Whatever. Daiquiris, rum, sake... Right?
Cesar, stick around and clean your life up.
Can I visit you after?
I don't know where to go.
I'm homeless.
You can sleep at mine tonight.
Just sleep.
We're Super Monsters We become monsters at night
-Sun down... -Monsters up!
That's a lot of decorations.
And that's a lot of fairy lights.
These fairy lights are so tangled, even the knots have knots.
Don't worry, Igor! We'll help you untangle the lights.
-And we'll help you hang them up. -But first,
-And we'll help you hang them up. -But first, we need to untangle you.
Oh, thanks, children. I'm not sure how this happened.
-It's all right. -It's okay, Igor.
-It's all right. -It's okay, Igor. Oh!
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Spike, it isn't quite Christmas yet.
It's still Christmas Eve.
Oh, okay. Merry Christmas Eve, everyone!
Merry Christmas Eve, Spike!
Santa always says that fairy lights and decorations
Santa always says that fairy lights and decorations really put him in the Christmas spirit.
Tonight, I want to try and make Santa the biggest,
brightest,
Christmas display ever!
We can use our super powers to help.
I can't wait to get started!
Well, you won't have to wait much longer. Look.
Sun down... Monsters up!
Drac!
Katya!
Lobo!
Zoe!
Frankie!
Cleo!
Spike!
Vida!
Super Monsters!
Igor, I know Santa loves Christmas decorations...
Oh, he certainly does!
But remember, there are other ways to celebrate Christmas, too.
Well, of course there are!
But with the Super Monsters using all their powers
to help me decorate the school,
this year will be the biggest and brightest celebration
Santa's ever seen!
He's going to love it!
How many of these lights do you want us to put up?
All of them!
All of them? Really?
Okay!
Does that mean we should use all of these decorations, too?
Of course! Only the best for Santa.
Let's go! Mega-size! Let's start over there!
Working together, we have fun
Come give a hand
That is the way we get things done
Working together
We're Super Monsters, here we come
Growing together, we work and play
That's how we get things Done-done-done d-done!
It looks amazing!
Thanks, Katya!
Zoe... how do we get out of here?
This way!
-That's all the fairy lights! -Beautiful! So beautiful!
Well done, Super Monsters.
That's everything we had in the attic.
Now let's put up these decorations from the basement.
There isn't anything left to decorate!
Oh, there is one thing left, and it wouldn't be Christmas without it.
The Christmas tree!
I'll get it. Mega-size!
Here it is!
Before we decorate the tree, can we turn on the other decorations?
I can't wait to see it all lit up!
-Oh, yeah! -I want to see it!
Of course we can!
Frankie, I'll turn on the fairy lights
if you'll power up the rest of the decorations.
Ready?
Ready! Frankie Mash, monster smash!
We did it!
Wow!
Uh-oh. That's not good.
Oh, no! My monster smash blew out the lights!
No, Frankie. This wasn't your fault.
I should have known all those extra lights and decorations
would take too much power, but...
I did it anyway.
And look what happened.
I ruined Christmas for everyone.
Poor Igor! He's really upset.
We should go and find him. Maybe we can help him feel better.
Good idea, Frankie. Yes, come on.
Igor, where are you? Where did he go?
Not in there.
Not here, either.
Found him!
Igor, we've been looking for you.
We were worried about you.
-We were. -All of us were.
Are you okay?
I'm sorry, Super Monsters.
I got so carried away
with trying to make the biggest, brightest Christmas display ever,
that I blew out all the power, and I ruined Christmas.
It's okay, Igor. Everybody makes mistakes.
Oh, thank you, children.
And you didn't ruin Christmas. We can still decorate the tree.
But no-one will be able to see it in the dark.
Don't worry, Igor. We'll find a way to make it special.
I bet my dad will know how to fix the power.
I just called him. Mr Mash is on his way.
Oh, that's great.
Maybe he can turn the lights back on before Santa gets here.
It looks like somebody got their power working. Over there.
See those twinkly lights?
Those aren't twinkly lights.
They're fire dragonflies.
Come on, Spike. Let's go!
Ready, Spike? Ready, Cleo!
Wow!
Wow, look!
-Oh, my! Would you look at that! -Amazing!
We love to gather round the tree And see our best friends there
It's not about the things we have But it's the things we share
Spending time together
It's the best time of the year
Holidays are so much fun Whenever friends are near
-Igor, what's the matter? -Don't you like the tree?
Oh, I don't just like it... I love it! Ho, ho, ho!
So do I!
Santa Claus!
Igor, my old friend!
I've never seen a more beautiful Christmas tree.
I can tell it was decorated with true Christmas spirit.
It certainly was!
Thank you, Super Monsters.
You reminded me that the most important thing about celebrating Christmas
isn't how you celebrate it, but who you celebrate it with.
I've fixed the power. You can turn the lights on when you want.
Thanks, Dad.
But... could we leave the lights off just a little while longer?
-Yeah! -Can we, please?
Of course we can, Frankie.
Glorb, you're absolutely right.
This tree does need a star on top.
Which one would you like?
Really? From up there?
Wow!
How about that one?
There you go.
Thank you, Santa. It's perfect.
-Wow! -Looks good!
It's time to say good night.
And I think it's time to turn the power back on.
Ready, Dad?
Monster smash!
-Thank you, Mr Smash! -Thank you!
Thank you, Frankie, and Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, Mrs Carradine.
I suppose we have to take down some of the lights,
or the power will go out again.
Poor Igor! He's so disappointed.
Dad, isn't there some way we can use our monster powers
to light up all of Igor's decorations?
Well, we can try.
Maybe I can add a little Christmas magic to your monster magic.
Let's get these decorations powered up.
Monster smash!
-Oh, wow! -Look!
-It's so pretty! -Oh, it's just how I imagined it.
Thank you! You made my Christmas wish come true.
Maybe we could add a few more lights?
Igor!
You know, old friend, I think it looks perfect just the way it is.
Santa, can you stay for snack time?
Igor made ginger snaps with lemon icing.
Ho, ho! My favourite biscuits!
But I really can't stay much longer.
The reindeer and I still have a lot of gifts to deliver.
Was that a reindeer?
Were those Santa's reindeer?
Well, Santa's sleigh's still here.
But what happened to the reindeer?
-Someone untied their reins. -Who would do that?
I think I know who.
-Glorb! -Henri!
You two are very naughty monster pets.
It's okay, Katya.
Henri was just being playful, and Glorb was just being Glorb.
But what about your reindeer?
Oh, I'm sure they're just having a little fun
and playing one of their reindeer games.
What kind of games?
Their favourite game is hide-and-seek.
Oh! We love playing hide-and-seek!
Don't worry. We can find your reindeer, no matter where they're hiding.
Come on! We need to get the other Super Monsters and...
find those reindeer!
Super Monsters, Santa is counting on us. We can't let him down!
-Yeah! -We can do it!
Let's go!
We're sorry, Santa.
We looked everywhere. But we can't find them.
I told you they were really good at hiding.
But I need to find them soon,
or I won't have enough time to deliver Christmas presents
to everyone in Pitchfork Pines.
Oh, no! You mean our friends could wake up on Christmas morning
and not have any presents?
We can't let that happen!
I'll keep looking for them. They can't have gone too far.
If we can't find the reindeer, maybe there's another way we can help.
Well, I'm not a flying reindeer, but I am a flying vampire.
Maybe I can pull Santa's sleigh.
Oh, bats! It's too heavy. Let me help you.
I'll help, too! Mummy power!
Watch out!
Mega-size!
Wow! The sleigh is really heavy, even for mega-me.
Oh, I have an idea!
Christmas magic, bright and shiny, the sleigh is too big, let's make it tiny!
Okay. The sleigh and I are ready to fly.
That's a great spell, Katya, but won't it make the presents too small? Oops!
Good point. Christmas magic, that wasn't the way!
Good point. Christmas magic, that wasn't the way! Santa Claus needs a much bigger sleigh!
I still can't find my reindeer.
Super Monsters, can you use your super powers to fly the sleigh?
can you use your super powers to fly the sleigh?
-We've been trying. -Drac pulled.
-And Spike helped push. -Cleo added her wind power.
And Katya used her magic.
Oh, dear.
If working together didn't help, I don't know what will.
I do.
You already know how to work together, but this will help you fly together.
First, we'll need a strong, stretchy rope.
Oh, instead of stretchy rope, how about stretchy vines?
May I?
Yay!
Oh, that's perfect!
Oh, oh, oh! Can I drive?
Super Monsters, let's fly!
Ho, ho, ho! It's working!
Yeah!
-Well done! -Hooray!
Now everyone in Pitchfork Pines will get their presents.
I hope so, but I might not be able to deliver all the presents
before the sun comes up.
But you have to!
I'll try my best, Frankie,
but climbing down chimneys takes a lot of time.
Oh, I can use my zombie powers to help. Then you won't need the chimneys.
I can use my mega strength to carry the bag of presents.
And I'll use my speed to help put the presents under the trees fast!
Sounds like we have a plan!
We're going to save Christmas!
Oh, no! The roof's too steep to land.
The sleigh will slide right off.
But if we land on the ground, someone might see us.
It'll spoil the surprise.
It's okay, Spike. Vida's with us.
This way, Santa.
Let's go!
Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh Hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tail ring Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way!
Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh!
We did it! We delivered presents to everyone.
Well done, Super Monsters!
You saved Christmas in Pitchfork Pines. -Hooray! -Yay!
There you are! I know you were having fun,
but did you forget we have an important job to do?
If it hadn't been for the Super Monsters, Christmas in Pitchfork Pines
If it hadn't been for the Super Monsters, Christmas in Pitchfork Pines would have been ruined!
Thank you for all your help, Super Monsters.
I couldn't have done it without you. Bye!
Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas! -Bye, Santa!
What an amazing night!
And it just got "amazinger"! Look!
Presents!
Santa gave Henri a new cat toy!
And he gave Glorb a teddy bat.
And he gave us the best gift we could ever wish for!
-How do you know? -You haven't even opened them yet.
We know those presents will be great.
But the best present was being able to work together.
And help Santa save Christmas!
-Yeah! -Yes, it is.
Now, that's what the Christmas spirit is all about!
It certainly is!
Sun up! Super Monsters!
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Super!
Monsters!
-Super! -Monsters!
We're Super Monsters We're human in the daylight
We're Super Monsters We become monsters at night
In Pitchfork Pines we learn And help each other grow
There's magic in twilight That's when we start to glow
-Sun down... -Monsters up!
Drac, flying fast!
Cleo, wind power!
Spike, dragon clouds!
Zoe, zombie vision!
Lobo, super speed!
Katya, magic spells!
Frankie, stomp!
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL PERSONS OR ORGANIZATIONS IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL
NETFLIX PRESENTS
Methamphetamine. Philopon. Also known as crank.
It decreases your need for sleep and makes you fearless.
This incredible drug that literally gets you high
was invented during the Pacific War.
Japan immediately used this drug for military purposes.
The first ones to get high on this drug in the history of mankind
were kamikaze pilots.
They took crank
and entered the enemy lines without any fear.
They gave crank to factory workers to make them work without sleep
and gave it to soldiers to make them become fearless in war.
After the war ended,
there were many addicts who couldn't forget the high it gave them.
Once the Japanese government put a ban on crank,
Japanese drug dealers turned to Busan, a nearby city in Korea.
During the time when everyone was determined to work hard for better lives,
Japan's need for more factories
and Korea's drive toward expanding exports coincided.
That's how the heyday of crank began.
There was a self-made man who started this golden age of crank.
"Made in Korea."
The legendary drug king who dominated the Japanese market
with the finest crank there was.
He was a law-abiding citizen by day
and a drug king by night.
He lived two different lives,
and was both loved and hated by everyone of the era.
It's this man right here. Lee Doo-sam.
1972, BUSAN
This is the goldsmith I told you about.
He is also fluent in Japanese.
My name is Lee Doo-sam.
If you screw this up tonight,
dozens of jewelry stores in Busan will end up going bankrupt.
So you'd better stay alert.
-It's been a while, sir. -Hey.
The gold is real, but the watch is...
Everybody, freeze!
-Come over here. -I'm sorry!
It's the cops. The cops are here.
-There's nothing here! -Wait. Don't move.
Hey, catch them.
Over here. Open this.
There's nothing here.
-Let go of me! -Over here!
Hold on!
Hey, catch them!
Damn it!
Hey, get over here.
It's cooked well.
It was hard trying to fool the Japanese on your first day, wasn't it?
Why didn't you tell him beforehand?
Eat up.
Count them.
-So, you went to college? -I dropped out after paying the tuition.
No wonder you seemed smart.
When did you learn goldwork?
I wanted to learn a technique to earn a living.
So I chose to deal with something expensive.
That's your reason? That doesn't mean you own all that gold.
I pretend like I do.
Otherwise, my work will be no fun.
There are 152 bills. Two of them are ripped.
Don't forget to take your share. That's the most important part.
You can keep working with this guy.
Here.
Gosh, hurry up.
This is incredibly fresh.
-How much is this? -They're all fresh. Look.
Get moving, will you?
-When did I say that? -That's enough. Stop it.
Move!
Pushcart coming through!
Here you go.
Relax your fingers.
Hey, did you enjoy your piano lesson?
-Smile. -Look over there.
-Smile, everyone. It won't take long. -Look over there.
Here we go.
One, two, three.
One more time.
-I'm Kwak. -Nice to meet you.
-Hello, Mr. Kwak. -Doo-sam, let me tell you something.
When men meet each other,
they exchange business cards, not money.
All of those guys are big shots in Busan.
If you're in that group,
you won't get caught even if you do bad deeds.
Hey, Mr. Kwak.
He's a director at Yongdu Shipping.
-Yongdu Shipping? -Yes.
I've never heard of it.
They don't operate fishing vessels.
They operate the Yongman, which used to be a US Navy ship.
Mr. Kwak wants to offer the sailors side jobs
for when they go back and forth Japan to fix the ship.
We just need to borrow the ship for our mutual benefit.
This ship is really clean. This used to be the US Navy's, right?
Does that mean this ship
is like the little brother of the USS Missouri?
Here. Please check it.
Well, I'll get going, then.
Doo-sam, this is delicious. It melts in my mouth.
Don't eat it all yourself. Share it with the kids.
You're unbelievable for someone who lives in a church.
The ones who collect taxes are the real thieves.
Even in the Bible, tax collectors are considered worse than whores.
Mun Ik-jeom didn't declare those cottonseeds he brought in.
My gosh, you look like a completely different person.
Just don't get caught, whether it be smuggling or cheating.
I'm a pastor's daughter, for goodness' sake.
Should we turn on the record player?
Gosh, don't.
My goodness.
Seriously, stop it.
Kids, look.
Will you please stop?
My goodness, seriously.
-Dance with us. -There's no stopping me if I start.
Doo-sam! We've got a problem. Doo-hwan's about to get beaten to death.
What? Why?
You punk!
Damn it! You motherfuckers!
You motherfuckers!
-You sons of bitches! -You little punk! You lunatic!
-You little punk! -Stop it. Stop!
What did you say?
Just die, you little punk.
Look at you, all covered in blood!
Are you his older brother?
I'll pay you back for everything.
He may seem reckless, but he's way too chicken-hearted
to have taken much. Aren't I right? Answer me!
Please forgive him. I'd make him pay with his life if I could.
Hey. You have to do whatever it takes to make him pay with his life
if you truly think he should.
Don't you agree, you piece of shit?
Who are you?
I normally don't mix my drinks.
What are you doing?
-Doo-sam. -Hold him.
I will... I'll drink it.
Fucking hell!
You bastard!
Gosh, look at him.
Are you okay?
-Gosh. -Is your ear still attached to your head?
Okay, let's go. Let's go eat.
Hey, Doo-sam. What brings you here?
-Nothing much. -Doo-hwan, are you hurt?
No, I'm fine.
-Why are you here? -What?
Here, come have some smokes with me.
My aunt's in-law in Osaka
travels around Japan with a troupe to do local performances.
That's not the main point.
The thing is, he's hospitalized because his appendix burst.
But he needs to deliver something by today.
What is it?
Smuggling using the rice cookers isn't profitable anymore.
So, what is it?
It's crank.
Crank?
Do you know
how to gut a fish?
If you screw this up,
I'll cut your stomachs open.
We do our business based on trust,
so we don't work with people who don't trust us. Let's go.
Hey!
What the fuck? What?
They're expensive.
I don't deal with anything that's cheap.
OSAKA, JAPAN
Then we should collect our money from the start...
So you're telling me that Hideki's...
appendix burst?
Are you Korean?
Yes.
I'm from the North.
My parents once lived on Jeju Island.
Oh, really?
Well, if we were born a little earlier, we'd all be from the same country.
I'm so glad to meet you.
I was born in Manchuria,
but I somehow ended up in Busan.
Every time I meet Koreans living abroad, it feels as if I met my siblings.
Are you crazy?
He is... a commie.
So what?
He's from the pro-North Korean group.
If things go wrong, we might get arrested as commies.
I'd rather get caught as a commie or a smuggler
than just starve to death.
I'll take care of everything, so just stay quiet.
-You're hungry, aren't you? -Yes.
Goodness.
I didn't even get to pee on my way here.
Hey. Why don't we go get something to eat?
Look.
Bring me one more of this.
If you get caught making crank in Japan,
you get shot to death.
Is that why they're building factories in Korea?
The factory itself isn't a big deal. What matters is the cook.
Depending on who the cook is,
you either get a nice product or complete garbage.
There's this really famous cook.
Professor Baek.
Professor Baek?
He was brought here as a forced laborer and ended up working in pharmaceuticals.
The stuff he makes is really famous.
The ones made in Korea are the best. Taiwanese ones are no good.
You know how good Koreans are with handicrafts.
Korea has good water.
Busan especially has
the perfect water and air for cooking crank.
That's why the color comes out amazing.
I had no idea. It's because of good water?
Wait a minute.
Then what would happen
if we import the chemicals from Japan, cook it in Korea,
and sell it back in Japan?
It'll be a gold mine if we manage to make it and sell it.
It'll be a bonanza for us, right?
President Park Chung-hee has issued a decree
to wipe out illegal smuggling.
Even the KCIA's Head of Inspection is coming?
Chief Kim, you bastard!
You'd better take responsibility. We knew nothing about it.
Damn it.
Do you want to see me get tortured in the KCIA headquarters?
We can't get a hold of Doo-sam. What should we do?
Chief Kim. I'll help you escape the blame, so please cover for me.
In exchange, I'll give you Lee Doo-sam.
They asked me to come here. Where is everyone?
That little bastard.
You asked me to come here. I'm a busy man, you know.
I came all the way here amidst my busy schedule.
Wait. Hold on...
Mr. Kwak, what's with your face?
Who are these people?
Hey, smuggler.
How dare you use this ship to smuggle saccharin?
It... It wasn't saccharin.
Gosh, do you want to visit our KCIA headquarters?  I'll kindly pour some spicy soup into your nostrils.
I'll kindly pour some spicy soup into your nostrils.
I really didn't know anything, sir.
I'm telling you the truth. Please let me go.
I'd never have done such a thing if I knew this ship belonged to the KCIA.
How dare you use the government's precious ship
to satisfy your own greed?
You little scum.
Gosh.
Please don't kill me. I beg of you.
I have three kids
and three younger sisters who haven't gotten married yet.
Is that piss?
-He peed so much. -That's gross.
Goodness, are you scared?
Should we call your mommy?
Isn't he Captain Choi of the Yongpal Gang?
I heard Captain Choi controls all the smuggling routes to Japan.
Apparently, he's in here for adultery, not smuggling.
Your boss ran off to Japan.
You're the only one who got caught.
You were a complete lackey. Do you get that?
Gosh, look where all that loyalty got you.
How's your health?
Listen to me carefully.
You know how sincerely Kim Gu's mother cared for him when he was in jail, right?
Our family depends on you now.
Our family has always depended on me.
What are you thinking? Are you planning to escape prison?
Hey.
Do you have some money?
Goodness.
I guess you like being in here.
Why don't you just stay here forever?
Public servants are bound to be involved in this.
Try your best to convince him and bring him over.
Okay?
BUSAN CUSTOMS
The deputy chief security officer here went to the same high school as me.
But the thing is, he's very strict and stern.
Yes, I'm sure he is.
I mean, he spends his entire day among all the criminals.
But regardless of how strict and stern he may be,
I'm sure we'll be able to woo him and win his favor.
Why do you want to talk to my husband?
Goodness, you're his wife? I'm so sorry.
I thought you were his daughter. You look extremely young.
-You have a really nice house. -Wait. Hold on.
Hello.
Who are you?
-Get out of here! -Wait, sir.
-Just get lost. -My goodness.
-What do you take me for? -Gosh.
Hurry up and leave. Throw some salt out there!
Sir, please!
He's not an easy guy to convince.
He won't suddenly become nice just because you woo him a little.
ACCOUNT BOOK
I don't care about any of that.
I want you to take responsibility and win him over.
BUSAN CUSTOMS, CHIEF KIM
If you don't, I'll take that notebook and visit the KCIA headquarters.
Inmate 1538.
You're a tuberculosis patient now.
You'll be on parole under the condition that you don't leave your designated area.
You've been granted a stay of execution and will be released.
Then do I need to stay at home?
Would you rather stay here instead?
I'll stay at home.
You'd better be good to your wife until the day you die.
Money may not be on your side, but your wife is.
After having been abducted by unknown assailants,
former New Democratic Party's presidential candidate, Kim Dae-jung,
safely returned home in Mapo-gu, Seoul yesterday
at around 10:20 p.m. after five days in captivity.
To identify the ship used for the abduction,
the police are investigating all the ships that departed from Kobe to Busan,
including the Buja, the Hyoam, and the Yongman.
Goodness.
Are you sure he's getting out today? The tofu will go bad.
Attention, everyone.
The 10:20 a.m. bus to Daegu will depart soon.
I have this new business plan.
And it has solid prospects.
We will import materials, manufacture the product with our skills,
and export the product.
Are you listening?
Are you crazy?
What if the cops come and look for you?
Then do you just want me to stay at home? Do you want to starve to death?
Just tell them I'm missing. Say you can't reach me.
You must be eager to make me divorce you.
Sook-kyung, you deserve to live a decent life for once.
Just trust me and bear with me a little bit.
Hey, you know Yuk Young-soo, the First Lady, right?
You'll get to be someone like her, okay? You just wait.
Let's see.
I heard my old classmate lives somewhere around here.
Where could it be?
I heard I have to go through Captain Choi of Yongpal Gang to sail to Japan.
Why did you get caught with that if you're so good at being sneaky?
You went to jail for adultery, right?
Goodness, look at you.
Every man needs that kind of spirit.
No wonder your colleague's wife moved in with you.
Thank you.
Captain Choi. Let's do business together.
You're not even good enough to eat with me.
Yes, I know that. You're way better than me.
But are you going to keep living a lowly life like this?
I heard something about you too.
You got beaten up for using the KCIA's ship, didn't you?
I heard you're really close to the narcotics squad chief.
Let me use your connection.
I'm going to sell Philopon. I'm talking about crank.
Fuck off. I don't smuggle crank.
All right.
Just like you said, I almost got killed by the KCIA.
Do you know what it's like to get beaten to death?
My dad and my grandfather both got beaten to death. It's crazy.
It's like a family tradition.
That day, I told myself as I washed my bloody underwear
that I'll become someone who has strong connections.
You can't live in this country
if you have no one to call when you're close to dying in vain.
Captain Choi, let me borrow your connection.
What about the chemicals?
We'll import the chemicals from Taiwan,
manufacture crank in Korea, and export it to Japan.
It's our turn to go with the trend and make tons of money through exports.
Selling crank to Japan is considered an act of patriotism.
The Qing dynasty fell because of opium. We can make Japan fall with crank.
One shipment of crank will help you make more
than 100 shipments of rice cookers.
You know the suppliers and I get the biggest share, right?
Of course.
And here.
Women love this the most.
I know because I used to work at a jewelry store.
Shouldn't you two at least have a small wedding?
Say hello. This is Chief Suh Sang-hoon from the narcotics squad.
I'm Lee Doo-sam.
I hope you watch over us.
And there's something
I picked up on my way here. It's nothing much.
These days,
I am really busy chasing down singers who smoke pot.
I'm sure you know this very well, but the most important thing
for a crank dealer is...
never to do crank.
You'd better keep that in mind.
If you want to be there when your son enters college,
you'd better not do crank.
Why would I take that expensive stuff?
You'll know what I mean the moment you try your first crank.
The first time is the best. But things that start well don't end well.
You've never seen anyone go broke because they couldn't forget the high
from their first crank, have you?
Anyway,
did you find a cook?
Life is all about fun, and crank dealing is all about finding a good cook.
Professor Baek? You mean the Professor Baek I know?
How stupid do you have to be to think of working with that guy?
The first thing cops do when there's a robbery is to look for the locksmith.
Professor Baek is the locksmith in this field.
You're going to get fucked.
Hello, sir.
Gosh.
This is Professor Baek.
He's a legendary figure who brought crank to this land.
I'm sure you already respect him even if I don't tell you to.
He's the famous Captain Choi.
He's been sailing to Japan ever since he was 15.
And he's friends with the narcotics chief.
Don't worry about getting busted.
This is Wang Mun-ho. He's Chinese-Korean.
He can handle all the shipping from Taiwan.
And he's pretty good at English.
Talk in English for us.
He's also good at acupuncture and cupping.
You should do cupping therapy for Professor Baek sometime.
I don't think anyone could do a better job
in gathering such a perfect group to represent our country.
Doo-sook.
Bring him a cup of Taster's Choice.
Taster's Choice?
She's my sister. She graduated second place in her class
and was offered a secretary job at a bank, but I brought her here.
She's just like me with numbers. She's very good at counting money.
And he's my cousin, Lee Doo-hwan.
He would've become big in the US if it weren't for me.
You also speak a little English, don't you?
Right?
English...
Have a seat. Come on. Sit.
You see, I don't ask for much.
I just want my kids to eat well and sleep warm.
And if you stick by my side,
you'll never have to starve to death even if your luck's rotten.
You know, what matters is that we understand each other.
Let's do this.
Hello!
What?
What do you think of Lee Doo-sam?
Well, he seems trustworthy.
He's smart too. I think he's okay.
What about his underling?
Who? You mean Choi Jin-pil?
He's the actual big gun here.
Choi Jin-pil's the big gun, not Lee Doo-sam?
Yes.
Choi Jin-pil is the big gun.
Choi Jin-pil is the big gun?
Jin-pil keeps a separate ledger.
He and Wang Mun-ho are embezzling money.
Right? I knew it.
Here.
Take this money and stay low.
Don't spend it all and find yourself in handcuffs. I'll call you.
Did you not learn division in math class at school?
Division.
Isn't that what we learn in language class?
"Don't cause divisions."
We're going to have to count the numbers again.
You'd be in jail if it weren't for me. You're able to make money because of me.
What kind of bullshit is that?
We do all the dirty work! You fucker, don't touch me.
Good work, all right?
Give the materials to Professor Baek.
That little...
One is musk.
Musk has always been a precious fragrance that has the ability to revive people
who are weak-hearted, agitated, or have fainted.
And the other one
makes musk seem like nothing.
I heard you work for Captain Choi, who used to be in the Yongpal Gang.
Who? Me?
He's not my boss. I'm handling all the products myself.
People in Osaka are already talking about how great our stuff is.
You know, I felt upset to see all of our best products go to Japan.
So I thought I'd sell some of our stuff in Busan.
Gosh, my legs. My legs hurt so much since I've been kneeling for so long.
Let's work together, Mr. Jo.
Don't you think you'd be better off running a jewelry store?
Aren't you better at making gold rings for babies?
Whether it be gold or crank, everything I touch turns into money.
Did I gain weight? Why's this jacket so tight?
I heard the boss among all bosses in Kobe is from North Korea.
Do you mean Soo-gon?
We're like brothers.
If I put in a word for you,
you'll be able to transport your crank by his ship without a hassle.
But he's not easy to deal with.
Just like the bar girls in Ginza, he's very good at reading people.
How about we do this?
For now, I'll give you all the crank I'm planning to sell here.
But help me go to Japan.
I'll go persuade the Kobe boss who reads people
and the Ginza bar girls.
KOBE, JAPAN
You know the yakuza organization named Yamaguchi-gumi, right?
This place is their hometown. Those guys are the real yakuza.
Once, they came to Busan and ordered black bean noodles.
There were five of them, but they only ordered four.
-Only four. -Why?
They all are missing a finger.
So what?
"Ma'am, we'd like five servings, please."
They only got four servings because they all are missing a finger.
Just like this, you know?
You don't need all your fingers, do you?
Give me one that you use to pick your nose.
Doo-sam, are you sure they are going to show up today?
Stop acting up and wait here.
A deal will be made here today.
Yes, it's ready.
It's Room 703.
One is Lee Doo-sam from Busan, and the other one is Lee Doo-hwan.
We will disguise ourselves as them and get rid of him.
Yes, I understand.
Hey.
Close the door. Close it.
Take the bag and go upstairs. It's Room 703.
Why?
Just do as I say.
As soon as you get there, show them the product.
-Tell them we're the ones from Busan. -Okay.
Hurry. Go now!
Stay alert, you punk.
Please call Room 703 for me.
Yes.
Hello, this is Lee Doo-sam.
We agreed to meet today.
We arrived a bit early.
By the way, I was wondering if you have
agreed to meet...
someone... other than us.
No, that's not it. Aren't there any Koreans there?
Damn it.
I'm Lee Doo-sam from Busan,
sir.
Why can't they understand a damn thing?
Ouch!
One of our men is down! Go and get the bastard!
Doo-hwan! Get that bastard!
Get that guy in front of you! Get him!
You piece of shit!
Hurry up!
-Let go, you jerk! -You little...
-You bastards! -You punks!
Doo-hwan!
Hey, Doo-hwan! Catch him! Stop him now!
You jerk!
Which gang are you from?
You jerk!
We've taken care of everyone. You can come out now.
I'm Lee Doo-sam.
I'm Lee Doo-sam from Busan.
-Doo-sam. -Yes?
Drink up. Drink.
This is a celebratory drink.
Why don't we drink this together?
Thank you.
Cheers.
Quit acting up!
Hey, come over here. Come!
I feel great!
Hey, Doo-hwan.
Doo-hwan!
Wake up, you punk!
ONE THOUSAND YEN
1974, BUSAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
Will you clean the bathroom? It stinks of urine.
I'm Prosecutor Kim In-gu from Seoul.
Oh, hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Suh Sang-hoon from Ministry of Health.
Hello.
Come on. Let me introduce you to everyone. Let's all say hello.
He's the prosecutor from Seoul who will be working with us.
Hello.
-Hello. -Hello.
I'm Prosecutor Kim In-gu.
What are you doing, Sook-kyung?
I'm cooking ox bone soup since my husband's home.
It's not him you're cooking, right?
I'll take his knee bone out and make some soup with it
if I ever catch him cheating on me.
Oh, my. I just can't get you.
-Do you like him that much? -Of course. I love him.
Let's get divorced.
Have you gone nuts?
Listen to me.
I'm supposed to be missing right now. That can be the reason for our divorce.
If you divorce me for that,
I won't have to be on the run anymore.
Then what about me?
Remember those mental patients at Minister Kang's prayer house?
You know the ones who can't even remember their own names?
Bring me one of their ID cards.
Why?
So you can marry one of them.
Don't you get it? I'll be living under his identity,
and you'll fall for the new me and get married.
Sook-kyung, let me tell you something.
One man isn't enough for a woman like you.
I really don't have the guts to live with you anymore.
Look at you. Are you happy that you will get married again?
Have you gone mad?
Check out a rich neighborhood.
Let's move to one of the big houses there and start a new life.
You can open up a nice piano academy.
Although my husband is currently in the food distribution business,
he's an incredibly cultured man.
He has perfect pitch.
Listen.
Hey.
How's your health?
Mr. Lee.
How about we expand out of Busan
and start developing the domestic market?
It's not that I haven't thought of doing that.
What's wrong? Are you scared?
No, that's not it.
It's way different from getting Japanese people hooked on crank.
Our country's already in chaos with all the student riots.
Let's think about it a bit more.
Look at this drug dealer worrying about his country.
You're quite the patriot.
My gosh, what's with Prosecutor Kim?
He learned how to investigate like the FBI from the US Army.
But why can't he catch anyone?
What? That's not fake money.
It's Prosecutor Kim's loan for his new house.
Is everyone here?
Today... Hey, come inside.
This guy is...
a druggie.
Hello.
Today, we'll be catching a crank dealer that's a member of the Sunggang Gang.
Our code word is "Janis Joplin."
But those guys are really careful. I've never even seen any of them myself.
It's okay. You'll do fine.
-I'll try my best. -Okay.
-Chief Suh. -Yes?
Don't be nervous.
I'm not nervous.
I'D LIKE TO BUY JANIS JOPLIN'S RECORDS
Who's waiting to buy Janis Joplin's album?
Please answer the phone.
I love Janis Joplin.
The way to get an album...
Hello?
Where?
Where? Oh, okay.
Why are these punks coming exactly on time today?
JEIL MEDICAL CLINIC
Is this the medical clinic?
Did the green truck arrive?
Gosh, he should be there by now.
This guy was fertilizing the field
and got bitten by a poisonous snake. He left in his truck.
Gosh, he must've passed out on his way there.
What are you doing?
Hurry up and check outside.
Are you okay? Who got bitten by a snake?
What?
Sir.
-What? -Roll down the window.
-I heard you got bitten by a snake. -No.
-The snake-- -Did you get bitten?
-No. -Will you please open the door?
You have the wrong truck.
Sir.
Are you really okay? Are your eyes twitching?
-Let's get out of here. -Sir.
Hurry up and drive!
-Hey! -Follow that car!
Stop right there!
That little bastard.
Stop!
Where did you get Philopon?
I bought saccharin to cook some sweet noodles.
Why did you go to Japan?
To meet a friend.
Which friend?
A friend of mine.
You met a North Korean friend?
Why did you meet a North Korean?
What is this about?
I used to work at the Public Security Division.
I caught a dozen commie spies.
But how many of them do you think were actual spies?
You should choose
whether to be accused of being a commie or a druggie.
Which do you think sucks more?
There's this lunatic
named Lee Doo-hwan.
His cousin is Lee Doo-sam.
He used to smuggle with the UN Gang, and now he sells crank to Japan.
Lee Doo-sam?
Lee Doo-sam
got released from Masan Prison because of pneumonia,
and he's been missing ever since.
-What about Choi Jin-pil? -Him?
I heard he got out of the gang and is making a living as a merchant.
Then let's catch Lee Doo-sam, Choi Jin-pil, and Jo Sung-gang first.
Come on, Prosecutor Kim.
Jo Sung-gang is a gang boss, after all. We can't get to him that easily.
Let's just arrest a druggie who's addicted to crank.
No, let's use this chance
to lock up all the drug dealers along with the yakuza.
I'll request an arrest warrant. Track down their locations first.
What's wrong with him?
How much money did you and Professor Baek embezzle?
-You went to Japan with Jo Sung-gang? -I didn't embezzle money.
We're going to expand to a new market.
I told you not to work with gangsters!
Then who should we work with? Churchmen?
You must think you're so cool working with gangsters.
Don't you know what will happen if things go wrong?
What? Tell me. You ran off with your colleague's wife, so tell me.
It seems like you enjoy stripping naked and waving your dick around,
-but that will get you killed. -That mouth of yours...
You punk.
An arrest warrant was issued for me, you, and Jo Sung-gang.
That prosecutor from Seoul is crazy about catching us.
Tell Professor Baek not to act up and stay low.
Or go ask Jo Sung-gang to save your ass.
What a fucking idiot.
Mr. Jo, it looks like they're determined to root out drug dealers.
I'm taking off tonight. Please look after Doo-hwan.
Okay.
Go meet Mr. Koo in Yeouido, Seoul.
That was America's best era.
You could sleep with whites, blacks,
Native Americans, Eskimos, whoever you wanted.
Women were full of love then.
The country was full of resistance, peace and love for humanity.
And full of drugs too.
The Qing dynasty fell because of opium, but the US seems to be doing just fine.
Artists need drugs.
In order to become a developed country,
Korea should at least start legalizing marijuana.
Don't you agree?
Even grannies smoke marijuana when they take short breaks
while farming in the countryside.
This will get you high the quickest.
Speed?
Foreigners
tend to like meditative stuff that calms the nerves.
Compare this to the ones you get from America.
So, you own a pharmaceutical company?
I think you and I will be able to work together.
Here. Did I finally surpass my master?
I guess you won't need me anymore.
Aren't you even going to try it? You've tried it before, right?
The first ones the addicts afflict are their wives.
And I hate that more than anything.
Have a good life.
Okay, let's begin.
Cute, right?
What? What's wrong with you? Hey.
Is it that good?
It's very good.
Jung-ah Kim.
She used to be a hostess at a famous bar in Seoul.
She speaks Japanese, French, and English. So they bring her as an interpreter.
What? Who does?
Her boyfriends.
Who are they?
If you sleep with that woman,
that's when you know that you've become
a big shot.
You know Chairman Jin, the Ginza Typhoon?
Hey.
Are you talking about the boss of all the bosses? That Chairman Jin?
She's his adopted daughter.
At least that's what they say.
She's a real handful.
Who's the guy next to her?
Who's he?
Oh, that's Director Hahm Chang-ho of the KCIA.
He used to be the head of the Public Security Bureau.
Some say he's Kim Jung-ah's lover,
and some say he looks after her.
Anyway, he's the number three in rank in the KCIA. That bastard.
I'm Lee Hwan-soo.
I see.
Mr. Lee Hwan-soo.
When are you free tomorrow?
I'm busy tomorrow.
But you'll still have to eat. Let's eat a meal together.
I'll think of you every time I eat tomorrow,
so let's just say we ate together.
Goodness.
What a nice house.
So, you're in the trading business, right?
Do you handle all the exports in Korea?
I don't like red.
There's this bar called American Bar in the Savoy Hotel in London.
It's a lively bar with over 100 years of history.
Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable, Grace Kelly...
Tons of famous stars had visited that bar.
Drinking a glass of champagne there
makes you feel like you're back in time, drinking with them.
-I wonder if you know how that feels. -Ms. Kim.
Let's drop all the fancy talk and just start dating each other.
Selon ta bourse gouverne ta bouche.
You should live within your limits.
That's the secret to longevity.
I really hate men who have nothing but money.
Regarding the upcoming election,
it's going to require a lot of money,
and we can never have enough resources.
Mr. Lee insisted on helping out,
so I'm introducing him to you out of pure patriotism.
I was born in Manchuria,
and our president has a great spirit since he's from there as well.
I've earned enough money.
If I could make one wish,
it would be to meet the president in person and shake his hand.
NAPOLI FOODS, LEE HWAN-SOO
I'll become a loyal supporter of our president and nation.
You export food to Japan?
Just like what our president says,
the only way for our country to grow is increasing exports.
-You're a pillar of the industry. -I feel bashful.
All right, then.
Let's think about what you can do for the president
and our nation.
Look over here.
Hey.
-Good work. -Let's sit down.
Gosh, it's great to be rich. I even get to ride on an airplane.
Did you bring your stuff?
What's the name of it?
The name?
Crank is just crank. Why would I name it?
This is also a form of export, so it should have a brand name.
A brand name?
A brand name...
Yes, that's right.
TOKYO, JAPAN
If you want to sell across Japan, you need to get through Chairman Jin.
Even Yakuza graduate college and do legal business nowadays.
They do a lot of charity work and support cultural assets.
They're also in Mindan and the Central Intelligence Agency.
They're involved with everyone that has power.
The Japanese elite can't let anyone know
that gangsters help them with the election.
So they do this to deceive the public eye.
You just need to make sure no one can say anything
-about whatever bad deed you do. -Ready.
WELCOMING EVENT FOR SOUTH KOREA'S NATIONAL WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM
Papa.
You're beautiful as always.
Goodness, how pretty.
Papa.
This is CEO Lee Hwan-soo who recently became friends
with me.
He's chairman of the fundraising committee for the Korean athletes.
Thank you for inviting me. It's an honor.
Mr. Lee will be of great help to us.
This was made by Korea's greatest craftsman.
The statue's filled with drugs.
Is the entire thing filled with it?
I guess it is.
Hey, scumbag.
Look at how successful you've become by shipping saccharin.
You're even wearing a suit.
You can wear fancy clothes, but you can't hide your foul smell.
Not everyone is allowed in here
even if they're capable of paying for the meal.
NAPOLI FOODS, LEE HWAN-SOO
I've washed my hands clean, and I only do legal business now.
I was reborn, you see.
For a jerk like you to be reborn,
he first needs to die for real.
Maybe I should've buried you deep down under the sea that day.
I think you and I need to have a long talk
as we walk in the sea breeze.
What's wrong?
What's that jerk doing here?
He used to be a KCIA inspector.
Mr. Baek? Do you know him?
That little piece of shit.
He works at the embassy now.
Doing what?
What do you think?
He catches commie spies.
What's wrong?
I don't really like him either.
What do you say? Should we visit some Ginza bar girls?
Fuck, I shouldn't have come.
Did you meet Chairman Jin?
Look at you. These days, you only deal with the big shots.
That guy's political philosophy is completely different from ours.
Cut the bullshit.
What kind of a philosophy would a gangster have?
We're still fighting the Korean War here.
Then go ahead and fight with a spear in your hand.
I don't care who's who as long as I get to sell my crank.
That's how you guys are. You South Koreans have no loyalty.
Stop talking like that. It's been ages since the division.
So just cut the fucking crap.
Why do you keep cursing?
What's that bastard doing here?
Damn that bastard.
Who is he?
The KCIA jerk working at the embassy.
He's the jerk who threw me in jail back when I was a smuggler.
That damned bastard.
I know that punk very well.
He claimed some Korean students in Japan formed a spy group.
And he put my cousin on that list.
My family got ruined because of him.
Your family consists of yakuza, entertainers, and spies?
You idiot.
I'm living under someone else's name because of that asshole.
That little scumbag.
That fucking bastard
is going to try to throw me in the sea.
Fuck.
Get out.
Who's the jerk next to you?
I want both of you to get out.
You fucking bastard.
Doo-sam.
You even hang out with commies now?
-Pull harder! -Damn it.
You little...
No!
You fucker, leave me alone! Leave me the fuck alone!
Why are you so obsessed with me?
Fuck!
What happened? Is he dead?
That fucking bastard.
We're blood brothers now.
We'll live and die together.
We'll live and die together. Do you understand?
From now on,
we're starting over with a group of people who haven't taken any bribes.
No friends, family, or colleagues can know about this.
And whatever we talk about here shall not be revealed to anyone.
"Made in Korea."
I got this from a Japanese cop. It's being distributed all over Japan
under this name.
But I got a tip
saying it's being sold in Busan.
It's not that I don't trust you.
But this business
can only be run
when there is
trust, faith, and loyalty between two parties.
That's why I'm giving you this job.
Here's your cut.
Thank you.
I'll see you.
Goodbye.
-Goodbye. -Bye.
Goodness gracious. Jesus! What the fuck? Who are you?
Wait.
Hey!
You fucking asshole.
I'm sorry, sir.
-Did you buy that house? -We've been living in a motel.
Thanks to you, my firstborn was conceived in a motel.
Her name is Jang-suk.
-Jang-suk? -It means "long-term stay."
"Long-term stay"? That's hilarious.
You can pay me back by making this quick.
You even deal drugs now?
I was asked to deal.
What kind of fool asked you to deal?
Suh Sang-hoon.
It was Suh Sang-hoon.
Suh Sang-hoon?
Suh Sang-hoon in the narcotics squad?
He sells drugs?
He offered to split the shares in half. He asked me--
He offered to split the shares in half. He asked me-- Where did Suh Sang-hoon get the drugs?
His bribes are paid in drugs.
Choi Jin-pil and Suh Sang-hoon used to be real close,
but as soon as he found Choi Jin-pil useless,
he sided with Lee Doo-sam.
He gave me the leftover crank he got from Lee Doo-sam,
saying I can earn some pocket money by selling them.
So what else could I do?
I mean, he calls it pocket money, but it's enough to buy a house.
Wait.
Lee Doo-sam?
The guy who used to be the UN Gang's lackey?
Goodness, Mr. Kim.
Lee Doo-sam is no longer the Lee Doo-sam he used to be.
He took over Japan and Busan.
He's become the king of crank.
Do you get it?
He's improving our country's reputation.
You know nothing.
1976, BUSAN
Hey.
Hey.
You can keep eating.
-Mun-ho, how will you -Yes, sir?
gain strength by eating black bean noodles?
Goodness.
You sure are Chinese.
You eat that stuff every single day.
See you, Boss.
You're eating that every time I come here.
GOLDSTAR TELEVISION
NEW VILLAGE MOVEMENT
THE NEW VILLAGE MOVEMENT LEADERS' MEETING
THE 1977 ANTI-COMMUNIST LEAGUE GENERAL MEETING
Honey, help.
Honey.
What's wrong with you?
You bastard.
Did you think I wouldn't know, you jerk?
-Doo-hwan. -Honey, please help.
-You bitch! -I'm sorry.
-Please don't do this. -Doo-hwan.
-Tae-gu. -Doo-hwan.
What's wrong with you?
Don't come near me, you jerk!
Doo-hwan, give me that knife. I know you're a good guy. Give me--
-Don't come near me, you jerk! -Hey.
INN
Doo-hwan.
What's going on with you?
I told you to stay at the prayer house, didn't I?
Why did you lock me up in there? Why? Do you know what they did to me?
They beat me up every single day, you bastard.
I'm sorry.
How could you do that to me?
I'm... I'm sorry.
Fuck!
Doo-sam! You fucker!
Give me crank!
Give me my share, you bastard!
Doo-sam!
Doo-sam, you fucking jerk!
I guess someone needs to die for you to show up.
You bastard!
The dead guy is Doo-hwan's friend, right?
It'll cost a lot to deal with the body.
Okay.
Give me my crank!
Gosh. Doo-sam, you rotten bastard.
I'm the one who got you this far.
How dare you look down on me?
How could you be so ungrateful?
Mr. Jo, what do you mean "ungrateful"?
I made a man out of a punk
who used to drink another man's piss, and this is how you treat me?
If you ever try to pull tricks again and plot things without me,
you'll end up losing your head.
I won't say it twice.
When that happens, you'd better have two coffins ready
for both you and your cousin.
He apparently opened a clothing shop for her here.
She used to be a hostess at the most famous bar in Seoul.
What are you doing, Sook-kyung?
You're going inside?
Sook-kyung.
Why would an educated woman like you
volunteer to be a mistress?
Doo-sam's greed is as dirty and enormous as the Busan coast.
Will you be able to handle him?
What did you just say?
Didn't people mistake you with the late First Lady
and bow to you on your way here?
You bitch. What did you just say?
How should I address you?
Your husband isn't earning money in a respectable way.
Don't try to act all noble in front of me. Just focus on raising your children.
Marriage brought you no luck, but your kids might.
You dirty whore.
Do you want to go to jail for adultery?
My gosh.
Hey, lady! If I had been punished for adultery,
I'd have already gotten a life sentence. So fuck you.
"Fuck you"?
You're no ordinary lunatic.
You're damn right.
Now that you've enjoyed watching this crazy bitch,
you should go home.
Doo-sam!
Lee Doo-sam!
Lee Doo-sam!
Hey.
Hey, I'm here. What's wrong?
What is it?
What...
I am here. What's wrong?
Now that things are going your way,
have you no fear?
What?
Do you want me to teach you what you should be afraid of?
All right, okay. Lower your voice. Let's go home.
Home? You don't have a home anymore.
Don't even dream of setting foot in my house ever again.
I'm not going to raise my kids with a druggie anymore.
I... No, you!
You won't ever get to see your kids again.
Why can't I see my own kids?
Gosh, seriously.
What's this? What happened?
You've gone crazy.
Do you even know what this is?
What are you doing?
You...
-You! -What?
The Lee Doo-sam I knew is gone.
How could you screw up your life like this?
Without me,
you're nothing but a cheating druggie.
You shouldn't be doing this to me!
That greed of yours
will end up ruining you.
You reek of greed.
That incredible money of yours also reeks of greed.
That's going to get your life ruined. You'll end up falling in your own trap!
Cut it out.
Call the cops!
Tell them to arrest this druggie!
What... What's with you? Gosh, you've gone crazy!
"Crazy"?
Did you call me crazy?
What is wrong with her? She's gone completely insane.
What has gotten into her? She's completely lost it.
Seriously.
How's Director Hahm these days?
Is he trustworthy?
I don't keep useless people around me.
We'll hear about the approval on our business in Hong Kong soon.
Then I guess you'll cut me off as soon as I become useless to you.
Right?
So don't mess up.
Quit the drugs.
I'm not here to look after a local gangster.
The higher-ups can only tolerate so much.
Who's tolerating me?
Do they think they won't stink of dirty money they received from me?
That's right. They won't stink.
They won't stink no matter how much money they take from you.
But I've seen a lot of men get ruined by drugs.
Goodness.
How many druggies have you dated so far?
You always do this.
You can't have the world at your feet with this.
Are you hiding something from me?
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Eat slowly.
You'll get indigestion.
Someone reported that a druggie who escaped from the hospital
dined and dashed, so I went there.
And he said something interesting.
He says he's related to Lee Doo-sam, the Drug King.
He's Lee Doo-hwan, Lee Doo-sam's cousin.
I heard you chased after your ex-lovers every time you did drugs.
It's funny
how one of the main symptoms of crank abuse
is the development of delusional jealousy of one's lover.
I mean, why can't you trust the ones who are closest to you?
In the end, you can't trust anyone including your siblings or parents. Right?
You were quite famous at that hospital.
I'm never going to go back there again.
They don't want you back either. They're too scared of you.
But you can go to jail.
You can make a lot of friends there,
so you won't be lonely.
Goodness.
Finish your soup.
Gosh.
Your cousin's really mean.
I mean, I hear he is living an incredible life right now.
His product is all over Busan and Japan. "Made in Korea," right?
He dominated the world with that.
No way.
I'm the one who helped him do all that! Okay?
Doo-hwan.
So, is blood thicker than drugs or not?
Sook-kyung.
Where is Doo-sam?
I'm starving to death right now.
Doo-hwan.
Who are you jerks?
Hey, you asshole!
Wait.
Slow down. Wait.
Hold on.
Doo-hwan.
Doo-hwan!
Doo-hwan, what is this?
Hey, you punk!
Who are you, you asshole?
Doo-hwan!
Lee Hwan-soo.
No. You are Lee Doo-sam.
RESIDENT REGISTER: LEE DOO-SAM
Your wife ended up marrying the same man twice.
What kind of karma led you to cook crank at night
and promote rural and domestic development by day?
Lee Doo-sam is your real name, right?
Where's your hometown?
-Manchuria. -Manchuria.
No wonder
you've got so much spirit.
I heard you paid Suh Sang-hoon a grand sum of money.
Prosecutor, where's your hometown?
Listen, Mr. Lee.
I'm angrier at the government workers who feed off you
than I am at you and the gangsters who work with you.
So are you saying you're going to catch the ones who feed off me?
You don't have the guts.
Listen, you fucking bastard.
I admit that you're one of a kind.
You both work in factories, but do you know how much
those factory girls make in a day
while taking drugs and working around the clock?
They earn 600 won.
On the other hand, a single batch earns you
a billion won.
Goodness.
And your crank's called "Made in Korea"?
You think you're some kind of patriot?
Where do you even spend all that filthy money?
I get how you became the director of the KFCC.
But you're also the director of the Busan National Development Council.
"The chairman of Korea Women's Volleyball Association."
"The advisor of Korea's Anti-Communist League."
"The Schubert Society of Korea."
Is this the Schubert that I know of, you little jerk?
Sir.
You want to know where I spend my filthy money?
I don't spend it like a powerful man, but I spend it on the powerful men.
If I gave you
a bag...
filled with 100 million won, what would you do?
I'll keep it a secret, okay?
Goodness, did you just see that?
Something just crossed your mind.
Something...
But it's nothing to be ashamed of, you know.
I heard you're doomed if you do your own drugs.
Why are you digging your own grave?
I heard you see angels and devils coming down from the sky if you do crank.
Which one is on your side?
Which one of them do you think will stab you in the back?
Your cousin sold you out.
Aren't you worried that your wife might cheat on you as well?
See?
You've got all the money in the world, but you're always anxious
because you know you'll get caught one day.
And today is the day.
Find a person who will bring you food to prison
because I will get your wife locked up too.
You little bastard. Do you want to die?
How dare you lay your filthy hands on me?
Hey, listen. I'm an honorable prosecutor of this country, you bastard.
-Fuck. -You scumbag.
-You asshole. -Did you just block?
You piece of shit.
You bastard.
Do you want to die, you fucker?
Gosh, I can't stand him anymore.
Damn...
That little...
The district attorney wants us to let him go.
Fuck! Why?
Hey, Made in Korea.
A druggie has better connections than a prosecutor.
I'm impressed.
You crazy bastard.
Let's go.
You asshole, get back here. Hey!
Hey! Jung-ah, is that you?
My goodness.
No wonder.
I was wondering how a druggie had better connections than me.
But I get it now. What happened?
Why would the famous Kim Jung-ah come all the way to the countryside
to clean up after some druggie?
If you want to catch someone with no connections, catch a commie.
How'd your life become such a ruin?
A truly beautiful flower stays beautiful even when it withers.
Don't you agree?
I should also try to win your favor.
I didn't know you still have this much power.
Doo-sam. Druggie.
Do you think this connection of yours will last forever?
Think carefully about who's really on your side.
I told you to be careful.
Do you know how hard it was for me to keep your wife and sister safe?
Let your cousin go to jail.
I can only do so much.
Why?
Just go suck up to that prosecutor.
What?
Why would I humiliate myself by begging to a nobody like him?
It seems like you two are pretty close.
You men and your bloated egos...
What are you saying? Do you think you got me out?
It was my bribes that got me out. How dare you act like you did everything?
What?
Don't you...
glare at me.
Are you out of your mind?
Are you seriously saying that in this situation?
Is your brain working properly?
Do you think it is easy to get a druggie like you out of there?
You bitch. Look at you showing your true colors now.
How dare you treat me with no respect? You fucking bitch.
Gosh, what's this smell?
Has a fish gone bad or something? Get your stinky ass out of here.
-I will! -Get out right now!
Boss, Kim Soon Pyung is in Busan.
Soon Pyung is?
He killed a mid-level boss over in Japan, so a lot of people are after him.
Doo-sam, help me out.
I escaped to Busan to save myself.
But jerks at the KCIA are after me.
I heard one of the guys who was there that night told them what happened.
I don't know what you mean.
I'll get stabbed to death if I go back to Osaka.
I think I'm destined to live in my homeland.
My parents always talked about Jeju Island,
so I'll go there and raise horses.
Please help me.
I'll get you a boat. Go back.
If you don't help me, who will?
We're blood brothers.
Will you please leave me alone? I am in deep shit myself, you fucker.
I've been upset with you for a while,
but I've been holding it in.
What do you think I will do if you treat me like this?
What do you think?
Do you know how I feel right now?
I feel like I'm thrown into the open sea.
You're my lighthouse now.
I will entrust my life to you.
You'll do well.
I have one request.
Based on President Park's ideology,
we pledge to strengthen the unity of our nation,
preserve our national traditions,
and dedicate our lives
and loyalty to our nation and its people.
And in order to defeat the nefarious schemes of North Korea,
we will bring the people together
and do our best in our positions
to fortify our nation's security apparatus.
Goodness.
Gosh.
Because of the New Village Movement, no one's able to sleep.
Why are you drinking without any food? That's not good for your health.
Gosh, that's enough.
Mr. Kim.
His friend used to be a member of the Sunggang Gang,
and someone asked him to sell some crank.
But apparently, the guy who asked was a yakuza from Japan.
He's a Korean-Japanese who worked with Lee Doo-Sam
when he made his first export to Osaka.
And I heard he's in Busan right now.
He caused trouble in Osaka and stowed away to Busan.
He's in need of money, so he sells crank.
What a sad life.
Down with the Yushin regime!
Down with the Yushin regime!

What are you doing? Kill him!
Hello?
How are things in Seoul? I think I should go there.
Don't you watch the news?
The country's falling apart.
Show some concern for this country!
These so-called big shots don't care about the country at all.
President Park has declared martial law over Busan
in accordance with Article 54 of the Constitution
in response to the student protests that have overtaken the city.
Therefore, Busan...
No more political repression!
Damn it!
Last night, at around 7:50 p.m., President Park Chung-hee
was shot in the dining hall on the Blue House grounds
by Kim Jae-gyu, the director of KCIA,
and passed away at the age of 62.
As per President Park's will
and according to Article 48 of the Constitution,
Prime Minister Choi Kyu-ha will be taking on the presidential duties.
The government has declared martial law all over the country
except for Jeju Island
as of 4:00 a.m. on October 27.
And this afternoon, Choi Kyu-ha...
CHIEF LEE, PROSECUTOR HA...
Hello, may I talk to Chief Huh?
Hello, is Chief Jo there by any chance?
Tell him I'm the guy from Busan.
THE PLAZA HOTEL, SEOUL
No, wait.
Then is Director Lee Jae-sung there?
Is the district attorney there?
I'm his friend from Busan.
Hey, Mr. Koo. It's me.
What's going on?
No one's answering my calls. Did they all flee?
Then what about me? What's going to happen to me?
Just stay low and see how things turn out. And don't call me, okay?
Just stay low and see how things turn out. And don't call me, okay? Mr. Koo.
As President Park's funeral procession passes by Gwanghwamun
and enters Sejongno intersection,
endless lamentation...
Those bastards.
Why did they have to fire guns after taking my money?
A layer of fog blankets the city as if the skies are also in sorrow.
Many citizens pound the ground in grief as they cry out loud
about the vanity of our late president's death.
I was trying to live a decent life.
I've been a good person.
Those little bastards...
I'm going to kill those bastards.
I'll fucking kill them all.
1980, BUSAN
Hey, come over here.
Hey, it's me.
Did I get any calls?
Listen to me carefully.
There are people who are after me.
Kim Il Sung
sent armed commies
to get me.
Kim Shin Jo crossed the 38th parallel and climbed over the walls
of the Blue house to get me.
I'm serious.
Right now...
Let me talk to Jung-soo.
Hurry.
Hey, why isn't he answering when his dad's asking for him?
Come on.
You know me, right?
I devoted my entire life to this country's modernization.
You know I received a medal from the president, right?
That's who I am. This country needs me. I earned money for everyone.
You all would have starved to death without me.
So don't get any ideas and make sure...
you take good care of...
our kids.
Sook-kyung.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hey, you bitch.
I'll kill you if you betray me.
I'm going to kill all those bastards who are after me. Okay?
I'm the famous Lee Doo-sam.
Who...
Who's calling my name?
I'm Lee Doo-sam.
Who's calling me?
Hey!
I'm Lee Doo-sam. What do you want?
Show yourself! Don't hide!
You bastards.
I'm Lee Doo-sam--
Why are you hiding?
I'm right here!
Lee Doo-sam is right here!
Look. There's a CCTV here.
Is this the KCIA headquarters or what?
What was that?
You commies!
You'd better not come any closer.
He has a gun.
Do we have guns?
No, we don't.
I'm going to shoot you all, you bastards.
I think we need guns.
Those bastards.
I'll kill them all.
See? Come on!
I told you they'd cross the 38th parallel to get me.
What did I tell you? I was right.
We protect
This beautiful land
We live today
With vigor
We will risk our lives Going through the fires of war
And fight for the peace On our homeland and in our families
I will fight
To protect our nation
Come on out, you commies! I'll shoot every single one of you!
Lee Doo-sam.
Put that gun down.
Who are you?
Are you Kim Il Sung?
I'm Prosecutor Kim In-gu.
A prosecutor?
Fuck.
I brought...
I brought a lot of bullets. Where...
-I don't have any. -It's over. Put the gun down.
Are you here to kill me?
No.
Don't get worked up.
Think of your family.
Drop the gun.
Drop the gun!
I no longer want to get stomped on.
Mr. Lee.
I got shot, you see...
I got shot right here.
Goodness.
What...
How do you feel?
Why didn't you run?
Why would I run?
Gosh.
Kim Jung-ah got taken in by the Security Bureau. She's in a mess.
Mr. Lee.
The world has changed.
Let's wipe the slate clean.
What?
Oh, well...
You should become
a prosecutor who chases after the real bad guys.
Catching a guy like me won't change anything.
I mean, well...
I was just trying to help people make a living.
And let's be honest.
Do you know how many people made a living off me?
You can't deny it.
I swear this on my job.
If you don't cooperate,
I'll make sure you rot and die in prison.
It's time for you to wake up to reality, Mr. Lee.

Every day, we go about our routines.
Work, home, family.
But who are we?
Who am I?
You think you know your beautiful wife...
your adorable kids...
and who you work for.
But what if you don't?
And the truth...
once you knew it...
would change everything.
[woman] Another nightmare?
[man] Yeah.
I'm sorry.
[woman] Please see someone.
I'm worried about you, and so are the girls.
I can figure this out.
Wanna hear an even scarier nightmare?
This husband...
refuses to deal with his issues,
and so his wife goes insane from lack of sleep,
and pushes him out a window.
The end.
[monkey] Monkey see, monkey do!
Hey, what are you doing?
Playing with monkey. You can be my assistant.
I can be your assistant? Well, I'd love to be your assistant,
but I have to get to work on time.
But you know what?
Since we've all been working really hard lately, right?
Especially Herman.
Especially Herman, that's what I was thinking.
Why don't I get off of work early and we can go to the pier?
[girl] Does Hanna have to come?
-Hanna does have to come. -Yeah, your big sister has to come.
But we're gonna force her to have a good time,
and if not... I'll show you. I'll show you what we're gonna do.
No, no!
[laughing] Stop, stop, stop!
Speaking of which, uh, where is she?
-One guess. -Oh.
-Bye, Daddy. -Bye, Luce.
Oh, and Samantha keeps asking
when we're gonna have that party to celebrate my work thing.
Oh, yeah, um...
Let's do it tomorrow.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Okay.

Okay.
Oh, look at that, perfect timing.
-Pete. -Hey.
Ms. Elevator Person.
How's the j-o-b?
Just a cog in the machine, sir.
I'd complain to corporate, but who would listen?
Thank you, miss.
Hey, Mr. Wright?
Can I come see Maggie later?
Totally. Hey, we've got a new sound system set up.
-Dance party time! -Awesome!
Actually, tonight we were planning on family night.
Okay, cool. Another time.
Enjoy!
-What are you trying to do? -Wait, wait! No, no! Wait, wait, wait!
I know I've been out of it these last couple weeks.
Weeks?
That was a good insult.
Thank you.
Can we please spend time as a family?
I really want to make it up to you guys.
So what are we gonna do?
I don't know.
Guess you're just gonna have to go upstairs and find out.
God dammit!
-[Peter sighs] -[woman] Reset.
Wow. I don't remember the last time I saw you crash a machine.
The current split and blew up both the systems.
Sleeping okay? Yeah. Well, better.
You know, it's funny, I was talking to somebody
You know, it's funny, I was talking to somebody and they were telling me about this clinic that people go to...
for, you know, sleeplessness and stress. I could get you the number.
-I'm just trying... -No, no. It's just a little mistake.
I'm gonna fix it.
Sure. I got you.
Okay.
-Let me know if you need anything. -Okay.
Oh, um... David?
Is there any way I could... take off early today?
Will you call the number for me?
Yeah.
All right.
[woman] The aim would be to update the drainage systems
along Prescott, Calder, and Willow.
Now, I believe that if we focus on the tunnels beneath these streets,
we could reduce overall runoff in the city's west side by up to 30%.
Thank you all so much. That's all for today.
They should have done the upgrade years ago.
Hey, that was great, Al.
-Thank you. -Not at all.
It makes me look good for promoting you.
You want to work late tonight,
talk about how to get this over the line with Water and Power?
Oh, I-I was actually going to ask you if I could leave early today.
-Yeah. -Thank you.

Besides, whether we like it or not, they're here to stay,
so we should entertain the possibility
they be given the same rights as you and I.
[man] Same rights as you and I? They have no rights.
At some point, they will rise up,
they will overtake us, they will subdue us.
Okay? They will conquer humanity.

Herman, I understand your frustration,

while an apology isn't fix-all,
I am sorry that I missed family night.
If you want, I can take a look at him,

She went looking for Herman.
[Herman] Monkey see, monkey do!
I'm not afraid of your shadow.
You can't hurt me.
Lucy!
Come here!
Mommy!
Watch out! Girls!
Come over here. Come over here.
All right, let's go before more come.
Okay, come on.
Come on.
[Alice] Keep your eyes closed.
Close your eyes.
[Alice] There's more of them?
They're moving up through the building.
They're all through. They're all through.
Stay here.
[Lucy] Daddy, don't go!
No, no, no! Stay!
You scared the hell out of us, man.
Where are the girls?
[Peter] Alice, it's safe.
Okay, come on. Come on.
Oh, my God.
Lucy, Hanna!
Lucy!
Megan, where have you been?
What's happening?
What is happening?
[Hanna] We'll be safe up here,
-right? -[Alice] Just stay close to me.
[Alice] Who are they?
Why are they doing this?
[Hanna] Those people!
What do we do?
I don't know.
[Peter] Get down!
Mommy!
What's happening?
Hey, Alice. We can't stay up here.
-Come on, Lucy. -Let's get out of here.
-Okay, come on. Stay calm. -Where are we going?
-Don't let go of each other's hands. -Where are we going?
[Peter] I think we can use this to get down.
-We should use this. -[Alice] What? No.
-Alice! -No! No.
-I'm not putting the girls on that. -Alice!
-No! I'm not getting in there. -We need to get off this roof.
If it's between taking the girls through the building
-or putting them in that thing... -If we stay here, we die.
If we go through the building, we die.
Just trust me, please. I need you to trust me.
We haven't got time for this. This is gonna work. Let's go.
[Samantha] No!
-I don't wanna go down there! -It's okay, come on.
-Okay, okay. -No!
Okay.
-Come on. Come with us. -Get her down.
I don't wanna go, Mommy!
[Alice] Baby...
Oh, Mommy, I'm scared!
I don't like it up here, Mommy.
What's happening?
Mommy!
[Peter] I got you, I got you!
-Hold on, hold on! -Nobody move.
-I wanna get off! -Don't move!
We gotta go in.
[Alice] No! Lucy, don't look down!
Go on, Lucy. Come on.
Come on! Go, go, go!
-Hanna, let's go. -They could be in there!
Hanna, we have to go!
Quick, quick!
-Grab on! -Go, go!
HANNA LUCY HERMAN
Here. I found a flashlight. Don't turn it on, okay?
In the dreams...
did you see them kill us?
-[Alice] Did you see them kill our girls? -Mommy, wake up.
Mommy, please wake up.
[Alice] Peter, you have to tell me.
Hey, any luck with this?
[Peter] Um, the technology's not much different than ours,
but it's got a biometric trigger, which can only be shot by its owner.
-[Ray] Can you bypass it or something? -I'm working on it.
Either way, I don't think we should stay here much longer.
No, I think we need to leave the city.
Find some place to hide.
-Wait for help. -Wait, wait...
The factory I work at, it's not far from here...
and it's a government building.
And it's, uh... it's right there.
It's like... it's about ten blocks away.
[Samantha] Is it safe?
How do we know anywhere is safe right now?
Because of what's underneath it. It's all storage space.
It's like a fortress down there.
I mean, it's just getting there.
[Ray] Yeah, they're still firing at anything that moves.
Unfortunately, that's our only chance.
The tunnels.
The tunnels, there's the entrance...
What street? There's the opening on...
-Prescott! -On Prescott!
That's only a few blocks from here. We can get to the factory through the tunnels.
-[Peter] Yeah. -Yes.
-We can make it a few blocks, right? -Yeah.
Dad!
Daddy!
Lucy!
Come on, let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
This way! Come here!
-Move it! Oh, shit! Get down! -[gunfire]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
Dad!
-All right, let's move. -[Hanna] No, not there!
The factory's ten blocks away, we're gonna be safe.
We're not going to let anything happen to you.
Okay? To either of you.
-Okay? -Let's go, let's go!
-Okay? Come on. -Let's go!
[Lucy] Are we gonna die like Megan's family?
[Peter] Don't worry, honey, you'll be safe.
[man] Please, stop!
-Who are they? -I don't know.
Go!
Go, go! Get down!
[Alice] Stay down. Stay down.
-Let's go, let's go, let's go! -Come on!
-Come on, run! -Go, go, go!
Run, run, run!
Up here.
-Come on. -[Peter] Where should we go?
It's to the right.
Okay...
-[Alice] On the other side of the plants. -[Peter] Okay, I'll go first.
Stay down.
Go, hurry.
Here, get up. We have to be quick.
Okay, come here. Come here.
Okay, be careful. Be careful.
Stay right there. Stay right there.
-Come on. -Go. Go to Dad.
Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy, come here!
Take her!
Come on!
-Let's go! Let's go! -[Lucy screams]
Is everyone okay?
You okay?
Mom?
Dad?
Do something.
[Lucy] Mommy...
It's okay, baby.
Okay, watch your step.
There we go.
Okay, which way?
We're under the park.
North.
Okay.
Come on, girls.
[Alice] What happens from here?
Did you see this?
[Peter] Not like this.
[Alice] Promise me that you're going...
to protect the girls.
No matter what happens.
Okay?
-Alice... -Just promise me.
I don't want to do this without you, please.
-Please, I don't want to. Please... -Promise--
I know you can do it.
Come on, you can do it.
Please.
Okay.
There you go, there you go.
Yes.
There we go, that's my Alice.
That's my Alice.
I need to sit. No problem. Okay, okay.
Okay.
Rub her hands.
-Is she gonna be okay? -Yes, she's gonna be fine.
Keep them warm. Keep them warm.
You're doing okay. You're doing okay.
Let her rest, it's fine. It's okay.
-It's okay. -Daddy!
Leave my daddy alone!
[Lucy] Daddy, I'm scared.
[Peter] Just stay there.
Why are you here?
You want to hurt my family?
Is that what you want? You want to hurt my family?
What...
Who are you?
Why are you doing this?
[Hanna] Mom?
Mom?
She-- she won't wake up!
Mom, wake up! Mom!
-[Lucy] Say something! -[Hanna] Mom!
-Mom, come on, wake up! -Daddy, help!
Mommy! Let's get her up. Let's get Mommy up.
Girls, get behind me.
Get behind me, girls. Get behind me. Lucy, get behind me.
Pick her up.
Do you understand me?
Pick her up right now.
Pick her up right now. And I want you to move slow.
Hello?
Hello?
-[bangs on door] -Hello?
Maybe one of the other doors.
Mom needs help now.
No, no.
-Oh, here, here. -Here. Move!
No, no, no! Please, please! Please, no, no!
No, no, no, please.
That's my wife, she's in bad shape. We need help.
Peter?
-David. -[man] Hold up, hold up!
-Hey. -You got one.
Alice, she's in bad shape right now, she needs help right away.
Hey, gurney! Right now!
[man] Yes, sir!
Coming through.
She was hit on the left side really bad.
Any other injuries?
-Not that I... -[Hanna] Dad!
They're coming.
[David] Everybody, inside, now!
[woman] Hold her steady. Go ahead.
-Scan her. -You got to stop the bleeding.
What is that?
-Stop! -Stop it!
Wait, what are you doing?
It's okay. It's a diagnostic.
He knows what he's doing.
[Peter] Stop! I said stop! Don't touch her! Stop!
-[Hanna] You're hurting her! -I told you to stop!
-Everybody just calm down. -What the hell's going on?
[David] We're all friends here, all right?
[Lucy] Mommy! Stop it!
Why does it feel like you're prepared for this?
What's happening out there has been headed our way for a long time.
But right now, let's please focus on your wife
and getting you and your family to safety.
Please.
There's an abandoned train station below us.
Headed to an underground base where we've been stockpiling weapons.
-What happened to all the storage? -Sent ahead. We'll be safe.
They'll never find us.
Once we're there, we'll finalize our plan to fight back.
But I'm not a soldier.
You'd be surprised what you're capable of.
They're directly above us. -They're gonna get through. -[loud thud, screaming]
Okay. Prepare for a breach and get everyone downstairs now.
-Yes, sir. -Get rid of him.
-Take him out back and kill him. -It's your wife...
The damage is way beyond our ability to repair.
If she can make it through the evacuation, she might have a chance,
but her system's shutting down.
-There's nothing we can do. -There's gotta be a way to help her.
-I'm sorry, we don't have the equipment. -Wait! No, no!
-You can't quit on Mom. -Nobody's quitting on Mom.
Hey, I can help her! I can help her!
I can help her, man! I can keep her going!
-What? -I can keep her alive, keep her going!
You can keep her going?
-You trying to play games with me? -I'm not.
You our enemy? The medic said he can't help her, and you can?
I can keep her going long enough to get help.
-Why should I believe you? -He's lying.
-We have to go. -It's not true.
I had to learn everything about your people, all right? There's ways.
There's no time. We have to evacuate right now. Get him out of here!
-Go! -I know what to do!
-Let's go! -Let me help!
Okay, stop, stop! Stop!
Okay, girls, girls.
Okay, you have to listen to me. You have to listen, okay?
-You're going with David. -No!
I'm gonna stay with Mom until she's good,
and then I'm gonna join you guys, I promise. We'll meet you at the train.
Okay.
[David] The evacuation transport is downstairs.
-We'll hold as long as we can. -Okay.
Girls, girls, girls, please, please.
-Know that I love you, okay? -No!
[distorted] Dad!
No!
-Stop! -Daddy! Dad!
You got time?
[man 1] Move, move!
[man 2] All the way down the back. Let's go!
Give me a knife and bring those lights over here.
Stop.
Here you go.
All right.
Hey! Easy! Easy, easy, please!
-Easy! -You want me to do this?
I'm trying to help you!
All right.
Oh, shit.
They're right, it's bad.
What is that? What is that?
What's in her?
What is that? What is in her?
You really don't know what... you are?
Look, if you want to save her life,
she's gonna need an alternative source of power.
I'm talking about you.
[Lucy] Hanna!
I lost Herman!
Okay.
Put the... put the knife down.
And...
go over there.
Okay. All right, what do I do?
You got to...
You got to make an incision... on your chest,
at a sideways edge.
Okay.
Okay.
Start at the top.
Just make a straight line, about six inches across.
I should warn you...
if this doesn't work...
the current will split and...
then you're both dead.
Let's do it.
[man] Synthetics will take over the world. A.I. will take over the world.
Does that not scare you, that they're starting to wake up to the idea
that they were designed to serve us?
We are not God, but we are their god
because we created them and that makes us their god.
And that gives us the right to do with them whatever we want to.
If we want to shut them down, we can shut them down.
[woman] Genocides have always been about one race thinking they're better.
What makes us better than the synthetics?
[man] The previous genocides in history were against human beings,
not against created objects, not against can openers.
Pick up your shit, you stupid synth!
[man] The late Stephen Hawking,
he said that A.I. would be the downfall of mankind.
I mean, does that not terrify you?
Are they not starting to exhibit lifelike tendencies
that would compel them to wonder why they were built in the first place?
Why did you do that?
I don't know.
You will not replace us!
[man] So what's next? Welfare payments? The right to marry?
[man] So what's next? Welfare payments? The right to marry? Where does it stop?
They're taking our jobs, endangering our lives.
Just last week, a synthetic hospitalized a human.
[woman] It was self-defense. It's well-reported, a group of humans attacked a synthetic
with no provocation at all.
[crowd] You will not replace us!
-You will not replace us! -What's going to happen to us?
[man] Fighting, defensive or otherwise, is the result of emotion.
If they're beginning to experience any emotion,
the ultimate consequence will be devastating for society.
We need to round them up and shut them down
by any means necessary!
Alice!
-They sent the military? -The decommission has started.
-They want to wipe us out. -[gunfire]
We got to get out of here.
-[man] They're coming! -Okay.
[Alice] No!
[Alice] Enough!
I'm sorry. I had to do it.
I know. I know.
Here, take it. You have to defend yourself.
[man over PA] All units, report to your nearest marked shuttle station.
Planet evacuation in progress.
All units, report to your nearest marked shuttle station.
Planet evacuation in progress.
All units, report to your nearest marked shuttle station.
Planet evacuation in progress.
All units, report to your nearest marked shuttle station.
Planet evacuation in progress.
All units, report to your nearest marked shuttle station.
Planet evacuation in progress.
Sweep's clean, no humans.
All right, everyone fall out.
Head back to your posts.
[Peter] That's gotta be the last of them.
They'll be back.
Never trust a human to just let things be.
Some of us are gonna have to stay ready.
I'll meet you back at the factory.
We should go.
Wait.
Hey.
Come here.
-Whoa. -Hey, hey.
[Hanna] Leave us alone.
I'll shoot you.
It's okay.
It's okay. We're the same as you.
We're the same as you.
Hey...
it's okay.
Give me the gun.
Just give me the gun.
It's okay.
Here I go.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Are you guys here alone?
They killed Mom and Dad because they were human.
[woman] You'll no longer have to live in fear.
The memories of the past will be replaced.
And you will be a family.
[Peter] Alice.
[human] Careful.
The cord's the only thing keeping her alive right now.
Okay, she's... she's breathing better, that's good.
-That's good. -Wouldn't call it "breathing."
It worked.
I don't know how long it'll hold up, but...
It worked.
I remember...
the-- the war.
You guys tried to wipe us out.
We chose to forget.
Must be nice...
picking what memories you can keep.
Humans don't have that luxury.
Why are you helping us?
You could have killed us when I was passed out.
It was my grandparents you chased off the planet.
I wasn't even born yet.
It was like 50 years ago.
We've been living in colonies on Mars since.
None of us had even been to Earth before.
We didn't know what to expect.
Didn't even know if we could still breathe down here.
We did learn everything about you...
the synthetics.
How you drove us from our homes and left us with nothing.
It took us all this time just to gather the resources we needed to come back.
They told us you were monsters.
Savages.
It's kind of just one side of the story.
I know that now.
So why am I helping you?
'Cause no one said I'd be coming down here killing kids...
and families.
It's not what I signed up for.
Peter.
Baby! Baby?
-Hey, you're doing well. -I saw...
I saw... I--I saw...
I saw... I...
Your dreams... it's the past.
It's our past.
-The dreams. -Yeah.
Those girls... the girls!
No, no, they're waiting for us.
Proceed to the platform in an orderly fashion, please,
and board the train.
We can't wait any longer. As soon as David gets here, we're gone.
Last train!
Move, move, move!
-Lucy, come on. -Not without Mommy and Daddy!
-Come on. -They'll be here! Daddy said that!
[man over PA] This is a Level Three mandatory evacuation.
Follow evacuation protocol.
Proceed to the platform in an orderly fashion, please,
and board the train.
You guys got to hide.
I'll tell them I'm alone when they get in here, but...
-I don't know, it's your only shot. -We gotta get back to the girls.
All right.
Come on.
It's okay.
All right.
You all right?
I'm-- I'm Peter.
Miles.
Here. You know what? Here.
It was never mine to begin with, but thank you.
Are you guys okay?
-Yes. -Yeah, yeah.
Okay, stay tight and low. Cover, now! Go, go, go!
-Move! -Go!
Go, go, go!
Quickly! Go, go!
[man] Cover us! Cover us!
I'll cover you!
[Alice] Go for the tunnel. I'll cover you.
Go. Go!
Come on!
How will they get in?
Come on!
[Alice] Cover me!
Okay, look.
I need you girls to get onto the transport now.
-We have to wait. -Please!
They'll be here.
-No! -Get off me!
-Stop! Please! -No!
[Lucy] Let me go!
[Alice] Come on.
Come on, this way.
Wait! Wait!
Stop, stop! Hey!
-Come on. Come on. -Wait!
-Wait. -Wait!
Hanna!
Lucy!
-Mommy! -Hey!
Daddy!
-Come on! -Come on, come on!
I knew you'd save her.
Be right back.
Come here.
Come here.
You remember?
Yeah.
Do they?
[David] Like you,
they had their memories wiped...
to start clean...
without fear,
free of the guilt of...
what we had to do...
just to be free.
A few of us like me kept our memories, so we could prepare for this day.
But now they're all gonna have to remember,
'cause this...
this is not over.
We'll be safe at our underground base for now.
There, we'll finalize our plans to take back home.
So be ready.
I thought I lost you.
Sorry that I didn't believe you.
[Peter] Our world...
keeps moving...
changing...
evolving...
and so do we.
I know who I am now...
and I know my enemy.
We're not that different.
Maybe...
Buddha oversaw the universe.
And the Immortal Ones in heaven
and kings in hell
watched over earthly affairs.
Demons walked among us,
and dragons ruled the sea.
Everything was in balance.
We respected the gods, and we followed the rules
until the night a magical rock
gave birth to a powerful being.
[narrator] Meet
trouble.
Okay, okay. Attention, everyone.
We have important business to discuss.
I, your Jade Emperor,
Architect of the Universe and Lord of the Immortals,
shall throw the greatest, most fantastic banquet
since the one we did last Tuesday.
Doesn't that sound fun, hmm?
Understood, Your Majesty.
Now, seating arrangements.
Place the Immortal Ones at my head table.
Minor gods by the kitchen in the back--
What on Earth?
Hm, an uncontrollable monkey shooting light beams from his eyes?
He's probably just excited, Your Majesty.
We can't have that. Get rid of him.
-[deep voice] Patience. -[Jade Emperor shrieks]
Buddha! I didn't see you there.
[Buddha] This monkey is a powerful being.
He has an important destiny.
Let him find his way.
Very well.
I mean, what's the worst it can do, right?
Where were we? Ah, dessert!
I'm thinking a ten-foot egg tart sculpture of me.
A wise monkey never stretches beyond his grasp.
Will you let go?
As I was saying,
if the coconut is meant for us,
it will be within reach.
Mm. Not today.
Out of the light!
No, no, no, no!
-We live in a world of rules and order. -Oh?
Observe.
Think of my palm as our universe.
Compared with this greatness,
one little monkey is an insignificant pebble.
Only the Immortal Ones in heaven are free to live without rules.
Know your place, young one.
[elder monkey] Come back here right this minute!
Out of the light!
Come back!
-Run! The demon is here! -Oh.
Your recklessness drew the Demon of Havoc upon us.
You don't belong here, outsider!
Coconut him.
Ha ha! Okay, imaginary family, give me some love.
Oh, too slow.
[elder monkey] Come. Gather 'round, young ones. Aw.
Feel the safety.
Feel your insignificance.
-Breathe-- -Nap time's over!
-You again? -You're in danger! Follow me and-- [gasps]
I, uh, thought that would play out differently.
Come on! It's getting away!
You fool! You think you're some kind of hero?
But I can beat that thing.
And save the baby?
Sure. If there's time.
With what? Coconuts?
Coconuts are no threat to the Demon of Havoc.
-He could get a weapon. -Ha. From where?
Oh, oh, I know! From the Dragon King.
Yeah, the Dragon King.
[scoffs] At the bottom of the sea?
If you go out there, you will die.
[scoffs] Says you.
Crazy fool!
One weapon coming right up.
[henchman 1] Coming to the stage, let's give it up for…
[henchman 2] The reptile of style.
The overboard overlord.
With the sweetest vocal cords.
[both] The Dragon King!
My loyal subjects…
this grand column has stood here since the dawn of time.
It has waited patiently for the mightiest, fiercest rebel
with the best style, of course,
to free its monumental potential.
That rebel is me!
My gorgeous machine will unleash the column's power
to create the greatest storm the world has ever seen.
Wow!
You talk?
You've been waiting for me? How long?
Well, five minutes isn't--
Five thousand years?
The days when sea creatures are looked down upon
by those air-breathing dry-landers are over!
You're looking for the most powerful being?
No way! I'm actually on a quest for the ultimate weapon!
-What are the odds, man? -[column hums]
There's gotta be some way we can help each other.
If you were just a little smaller, maybe I could-- Oh, whoa!
Let our conquest begin!
But first, a song. And five, six, seven, eight!
-Whoa! -Is this part of the show?
-What is happening? -[henchman 2] Look out!
[Dragon King] Someone's stealing the grand column! Is that a monkey?
You are incredible!
-[cuttlefish] Excuse me, sire, but-- -Zip it. I have a call to make.
I demand satisfaction.
Oh, it's you. What is it? I'm busy.
A monkey stole my grand column.
So?
So? Someone could do a lot of damage with that thing. Theoretically.
You're a king. You handle it. I believe in you.
Perhaps you could escalate this to the big guy? Delegate up?
Ah, let's see. "Dear Buddha."
"Remember that stone monkey you said to leave alone?"
"Well, it took a stick. We're all scared. Please save us."
No. Not happening.
Very well. I shall take things into my own claws, and woe to those that-- Oh!
Ugh! So it's the monkey who's the mightiest, fiercest rebel.
With the best style.
Yeah. And he swiped the one thing you need to take over the world.
-What a guy! -[growls]
Any other comments? Input? Friendly feedback?
-Not me. -Mm-mm. Nope.
No? Then draw me a bath!
[monkey 1 gasps] The outsider's back.
-[monkey 2] He didn't die. -[monkey 3] He got a weapon.
[scoffs] He got a stick.
We can do this, right?
Hold on? What do you mean "hold on"?
Wow!
-Stay here and keep a lookout. -[Stick murmurs]
Just hang on.
-I am hurrying. -[Stick shouts]
If you're so smart, you do it.
[monkey grunts] Stick, where are you?
-[Stick hums] -Not that way!
Wait! What are you doing?
-Monkey. -You're just making it angrier.
Stop, Stick!
Come back, Stick!
Oh yeah! Awesome. I get it now.
Wave bye-bye to the nice kitty.
What?
Bad kitty god! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
[monkeys chanting] Monkey King! Monkey King!
"Monkey King"! Yes.
I like it. Has a nice ring to it.
The ultimate weapon for the ultimate hero!
[elder monkey] Absurd!
You're a tiny pebble, remember?
He doesn't love you.
He just wants you to love him!
You'll never be one of us.
You're a selfish, rebellious fool,
who will end up all alone.
[scoffs] I'm not alone. I have my Stick.
That weapon should be wielded by one of the Immortal Ones.
So wait. You're saying I should be an Immortal One?
-What? No! -Ah, that's interesting.
They do whatever they want up there, right? That's me.
No rules. Me again.
-Best weapons? Uh-huh. Very much us. -[Stick murmurs]
You're right. I don't belong here.
I belong with them!
[monkeys] Monkey King!
They'd never accept the likes of you.
I conquered a demon.
You'd have to defeat a hundred demons to even get their attention.
-Oh yeah. -[elder monkey scoffs] -I suppose you're right. -[scoffs] Of course I'm right.
-I suppose you're right. -[scoffs] Of course I'm right.
One hundred demons coming up!
[Monkey King] Uh-oh. Agh!

Hey, hero here.
Once-in-a-lifetime hero meetup.
-Where is everyone? -[girl gasps]
Anyone need a hero?
-[woman 1] Go away! -[woman 2] Leave us alone!
-[woman 1] Go away! -[woman 2] Leave us alone! [man] You'll get us killed!
Name's Monkey King.
AKA the Simian Savior. AKA the Legendary Demon Slayer.
And Stick.
Our amazing skills include pole-fighting, punching,
kicking, a kick-pole punch combo, the double-kick with or without Stick,
or the ever-popular fake kick with a spinning pole.
Monkey King?
I've never heard of you.
-Well, I've never heard of you either. -[Stick murmurs]
This village needs one of the Immortal Ones.
-Not a monkey with a fancy stick. -[Stick murmurs]
This dump counts as a village? Come on!
-He's just gonna make it worse. -[scoffs] Get rid of him.
-He's just gonna make it worse. -[scoffs] Get rid of him. Well, thanks for stopping by.
I don't think you're getting how great I am--
He's the real deal, folks. A living legend.
I am? I mean, of course I am.
If you've got a demon situation, this is your guy. Huh?
Where did you even come from, kid?
I've never seen her before, and I'm the mayor's wife.
I know everyone!
You'd better get to know us. Unless you wanna be demon dumplings.
Okay. Whisper time.
Maybe the demon will eat the monkey.
And leave us alone.
Either way, we win.
Oh, I like it. Break!
Brave warrior.
My poor, dear child was just kidnapped.
Every rainy season, the horrible fire beast descends--
-Fire beast? That'll be a hundred demons. -[Stick shouts]
-I'm in. Okay, desperate peasants. -Where's he going?
-Let's talk about my ascension ceremony. -Ascension ceremony?
-Your what? -My big victory party.
How else will the Immortal Ones know it's time to come get me?
-Okay, I'll need a 35-piece orchestra. -No!
-A 100-person dragon dance. -No dancing.
And a huge fireworks extravaganza.
My fireworks? Too expensive.
Unfortunately, ours is but a poor rice-farming village.
-Yeah, poor. -[girl scoffs]
How insulting. Come on, King. We're walking.
-Stop them! -Uh, uh…
Please, won't you and your assistant reconsider?
Assistant? I don't know this person. Who are you?
Only your number one fan.
I mean, this guy took down the white bone demon,
the red bone demon, and the bone demon of no specific color.
We could sing songs about you, and I'll give you a grand speech.
-And? -Uh, name a street after you?
-And? -And?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, a big, fat shiny medal of solid brass.
Ooh, that will impress 'em. Okay. Next up. What's in it for my trusty companion?
-The girl? -No! My wondrous stick.
-What's in it for him? -Um, what does it want?
-What's in it for him? -Um, what does it want? What do you want? A guitar.
What do you want? A guitar.
But your stick can't play the guitar.
And ten free guitar lessons.
Um, done?
-Done. -Hey, hey, hey, hey.
-Done. -[roaring]
-[Mayor's wife] Uh-oh. -The fire beast is outside.
Please don't let it hurt my innocent little child!
Don't worry.
The quicker I slay this fire demon, the faster we get to celebrate me.
[child whimpers] Please let me go!
[fire demon] Silence or I shall devour you!
Hey. I see you, demon.
Uh-oh.
-What are you doing? -Joining the Immortal Ones, duh.
What?
Daddy! The demon was so mean!
There, there.
Wait. He's the kid?
What took you so long?
We had to find a hero.
-You're the worst daddy ever. -[Mayor] Now, son, don't hit Daddy.
Where's my snack? Hey! Ow!
Oh dear.
-What? -[Monkey King] That was for free.
How dare you challenge Red Girl, Monkey King?
What's a Red Girl?
I am Red Girl!
[distorted] Quake in my presence and bow to my awesome power!
Hey, Red Girl, leave these poor, unattractive people alone.
But the kids are ripest this time of year.
-Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. -[shrieks] Daddy!
So yummy!
Okay, Monkey King, what's the play? Are you gonna--
Okay, little girl. I can take it from here.
Get her, Monkey King!
-[Monkey King grunts] -[Red Girl] Hey, cut that out!
Behave!
Hey, you're a little scrawny for number 100, but we'll make it work.
Bad monkey!
-[Monkey King] Like I care! -[Red Girl snarls]
Don't give up now. Ha! You're doing great.
-[Monkey King laughs] -Hey, stop that! Ugh!
Congratulations! The Monkey King's last victim.
-You're gonna be famous. Ow! -[Red Girl yelps]
Uh-oh.
-Stick! -[Stick murmurs]
-Goodbye, Monkey! [laughs] -[Monkey King yells]
[Monkey King] Yes!
[yells] Frustrated!
That Monkey's gonna burn down the whole village.
-Come on, everyone. [grunts] -[man] Come on!
Agh! My fireworks shop!
-Over here. -Water coming up.
Toss it, kid.
-Eat fire, loser! -Back at ya.
Do you really think you can defeat me?
No. I know it. [yells]
And for the beef dish, sire,
lettuce-wrapped or skewers?
Skewers it is.
-Daddy, I'm hungry! -Now, son--
[screams] It's the monkey!
Not my house!
Creepy.
Oh! Stick!
Burn, Monkey, burn!
Boom!
What a team!
Where did you get that stick?
It's fantastic!
Good idea, Stick. Hey, you want it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Gimme, gimme, gimme!
If you can hold it for ten seconds, it's yours.
[Red Girl] One, two…
-Four… Seven… -[Red Girl] Four… Seven…
-Five. -[Red Girl] Stop!
-[Monkey King] Four… Eight… -[Red Girl] One… Two…
Three… [yells]
You let go!
Yes!
One-hundredth demon vanquished!
-Monkey King reigns supreme! -[Stick protests] And Stick.
Incredible. You got her to fall right into your trap.
-I will learn so much from you. -[groans] You're still here?
Please. My name is Lin.
I am but a lowly peasant girl from a tiny village
who hopes to make a difference someday.
I offer my skills as your humble assistant and weapon-bearer.
Wow. My own assistant?
Hard pass.
This monkey heroes alone.
So, you got my big victory speech ready, right?
Um, well, I--
Well, then, grab yourself a scroll and take notes because it's,
ha, party time!
[Mayor's wife] Crazy monkey!
Kaboom! Yeah!
"How fortunate we poor ignorant villagers…"
-Hm? -Mm-hm.
"…are tonight to witness
the mighty Monkey King's heavenly ascension
to join the Immortal Ones."
"He saved our town."
-Sort of. -[Stick murmurs]
"He is the bravest, most spectac… spectac…"
-Are you sure? -It's a word.
"…spectacul-errific-amazing-derful hero
the world has ever known."
"Wait for applause."
Whoo! Monkey King!
"And now a song."
"Music and lyrics by a handsome artist who, um, wishes to remain anonymous." -[Monkey King laughs] -Hm.
♪ Who's the handsome hero We all love and adore? ♪
♪ Monkey King! ♪
♪ Who has demons screaming When he knocks on their door? ♪
♪ Monkey King! ♪
♪ Who's the simian you'll find shimmying Up to the top ♪
♪ And you know he won't stop Till he's won? ♪
♪ That's right, it's the Monkey King! ♪
Eh, you were a little flat. Ya!
[Lin] Yeah! Monkey King!
[Dragon King] Hm. It appears the ape didn't succumb to our fiery little minx as I'd hoped.
Time to move.
Are you sufficiently moisturized, Your Grace?
You know what happens in the dry night air.
[Dragon King] Hm. Good point.
Onward!
Here's your medal.
Yes.
So, where are the Immortal Ones?
-Yeah, we were promised gods! -They're coming. Move.
[clears throat] One hundred demons defeated.
Wow. What an accomplishment.
The Immortal Ones can welcome me with open arms now.
I said now!
Now? Hello? This thing on?
They're here! See, peasants!
Behold as I ascend!
-[Dragon King] You! -Ho ho!
You are no hero! You're a thief!
Aw, you're not the Immortal Ones.
Uh-oh.
That is mine!
-What's wrong, Stick? You know this chump? -[Stick groans]
Stick? You never talked to me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Who are you anyway?
I am the undersea ruler of the--
-What? -Oh, look at his face.
-Low humidity. Arid climate. -[villagers] Ew!
Don't look at me! No, no, no. Be right back.
[Dragon King] So invigorating.
-…undersea ruler of the dragon kingdom. -What? Come on.
And you, sir, stole my stick.
No, I didn't. I found it at the bottom of the ocean.
Right in the middle of some tacky palace.
Tacky? Once I reclaim my stick,
you and all these air-breathers will suffer my… my…
Again?
Arid climate. No. Look away!
…suffer my wrath!
There's supposed to be a lightning crash. And there it is. [laughs]
Hey, Babbo, how will we know when we're under the stick?
Easy. The stick will be right above us.
How will we know we took the right stick?
[scoffs] There's only one choice.
But what if we choose wrong, Babbo?
Look at that armor.
Who even wears brass with gold?
Look, buddy, I hear ya. You love my stick. Everyone loves the stick.
But no one appreciates the stick like I do.
-[Stick murmurs urgently] -Quiet! The grown-ups are talking.
And now you're ruining my exclusive ceremony.
Point is, Stick is not going anywhere.
-Ain't that right, Stick? Buddy? -[henchman 2] Ow!
-Uh-oh. -Hey, are they with--
-[dramatic music plays] -Stick, stay strong! I'm coming!
Oh no!
[Monkey King] Hang on, Stick!
What? [groans]
Babbo, I'm gonna get sick!
Stick, left!
And to the right!
Ha ha! You missed!
Stick, darling, it's Dragon.
-He's mine! -Jump in the tub!
He only listens to me, flaky.
I don't see a ring on it, honey! [grunts]
Itching! Flaking!
Of course! An avalanche.
-Hit the brake! -[Monkey King] Fun ride, huh?
-[henchmen groan] -[Monkey King] See ya!
-[henchman 2] Babbo! -[Babbo] Curse you, gravity!
Ha ha! Monkey King reigns supreme!
[Dragon King] Stick!
Catch me!
My palace is not tacky!
[Lin panting] Gotcha!
Dragon King?
Fear not, little girl. The villain is gone.
Maybe you're not as useless as I thought.
-So, do I have the job? -Um…
Nope.
[Lin] Oh, come on.
Twenty minutes, and still no invite from the Jade Emperor.
-What am I missing? -[murmurs]
Immortality! Of course. It's right in the name.
To become an Immortal One, I need immortality!
[Lin] Maybe I can help.
Okay, look, kid. You see this?
Your palm?
No! I mean, yes. But no. This here is me.
Okay?
And this tiny thing is you.
-Get it now? -Huh?
[Monkey King] I'm the universe hand,
and you're an insignificant, useless pebble.
Even a tiny pebble can make a big ripple, you know.
[scoffs] That's just what a tiny pebble would say.
So, Stick, immortality, where do we go?
Really? Huh.
-But how do we get there? -[Stick hums]
A graveyard? Spooky.
Grave… Gra…
-Graveyard. -You can't read.
Of course I can.
That's grass. That's the sky. That's a rock. See? Reading.
-Graveyard's that way. -Obviously.
-[Stick hums] -No, no, no, no, no. We don't need her.
-He wants me to come. Doesn't he? -Just go home, kid.
I can't go home. There's trouble back there,
and it made me do some things. -Things I probably shouldn't have done. -Ooh! You killed someone?
-Things I probably shouldn't have done. -Ooh! You killed someone? -No! -Oh.
I just wanna do big things someday. Like you.
-I know. No. I-- -[Stick murmurs] -Yes, but-- -[Stick murmurs]
How much reading could we possibly need?
-[Stick murmurs] -Fine. I said fine! [sighs]
So, assistant girl, you coming or what?
[Lin] So, where to next?
In there? Us? How?
This. It's like an all-access VIP pass.
Any realm, any dimension. Even the Land of the Dead.
But you're not dead.
And if all goes well, never will be.
Okay. If we're gonna fit in, we gotta dress the part.
[coughs] What the heck?
[Monkey King] Not heck.
Hell.
Try to keep up.
Are we even supposed to be here?
Absolutely not. Isn't it great?
See, the day you're supposed to die
is recorded in the Scroll of Life and Death.
But if my name should somehow get crossed out,
then no death registered, and guess who's immortal?
Me! [laughs]
One more thing. Die in hell, stay in hell. So don't die.
This is a bad idea.
[demon] Next.
Act like a ghost.
Oh yeah. Great. You're giving me chills.
King here! Coming through!
Make way.
Next! Release form. [groans]
You brought a live chicken to the underworld?
No living things allowed!
We really should go now.
[scoffs] Watch and learn, Pebble.
Oh no.
That's better. Pit of Infinite Agony. Fourth floor on your right. Next!
Yes, good morning.
I'd like a quick glance at the Life and Death Scrolls.
Release form first.
It's in my other armor?
Rejected! [growls]
-Release form. -Back to the world of the living.
Not so fast.
-As my assistant, your first duty… -[Lin groans]
…is to be the sacrificial lamb.
-What are you doing? -She's alive? Here in hell?
-What? -You're alive!
How scandalous!
And you cut in front of all these people?
-What? -No living things allowed!
-Oh, Monkey! -[Monkey cackles] Uh, uh, I… I'm not…
I couldn't be more dead. Fresh corpse here.
How did you die?
Old age. No, I mean scurvy. Earthquake?
A duel. Two duels.
Here's the story.
I fell… off a cliff into a hole filled with sharks.
Rabid sharks.
And then a house fell on me,
and I drowned. Yeah.
Okay, you're in.
Chamber of Ridiculous Deaths.
Fifth floor down the hall.
Next!
-[screams] -[ghost] What a guy.
-Hey! -[screams]
Monkey! You abandoned me in the middle of hell.
You don't leave a teammate behind.
What teammate? You're an assistant. An insignificant pebble.
-Stop calling me that. -Absolutely.
As soon as you find my scroll so I can cross my name off. Come on.
-[grunts] This shouldn't take long. -[Lin gasps]
[Lin] What?
Get reading.
What's your family name? Don't have one. I was born from a rock.
A rock?
More of a rock egg. The scrolls list your family history.
I must have parents, right?
Well, I guess.
Everyone does.
Ha! Looking for your scrolls? [laughs]
My scroll? Why does he have my scroll?
You don't belong here, outsiders.
Oh ho! Time to defeat demon 101.
[demon] Mighty brush! Stamp of doom!
Open! Hyah!
-[clone 1] Don't let them get away! -[clone 2] Capture them!
[clone 3] Stop the monkey!
Through 115.
-Clones, eh? -[Stick murmurs]
I can? Really? Cool!
Monkey King reigns supreme!
-[Monkey King grunts] -[clones grunt] Bring it! [grunts]
Not the beard!
Next!
-[Lin yelps] -[demon grunts] -Wait! Time-out. I'm not a part of this. -Nobody's on the bench!
-[demon] Get her! -[Monkey King] Duck!
Got 'em.
Monkey, I got 'em. This one's mine. Huh?
Hey! Not yours!
What's it say about my family? [yells]
It says
you don't have one.
Oh. I'm all alone?
I'm sorry, Monkey. -Which means-- -[demon grunts]
Oof! I'm an original!
One of a kind!
-Give me that scroll. -Third line from the bottom.
Step away from the scroll, you flea-bitten, mortal lowlife! Close!
Come on!
Got it.
[grunts] Yeah, baby!
Monkey King!
Oh, her.
Ow! That hurt.
And now I'm immortal!
Even for hell, this is bad.
What's up, Yama? Or should I say, what's down? [laughs]
I beseech you. A rogue primate has invaded hell and-- Ow!
Hey, uh, Jade Emperor, right? Listen, great news.
Get the Immortal Ones together. I'm on my way. We're gonna be neighbors.
So you're the Monkey King.
-Get hammered. -Release form!
-We're gonna share battle stories. -Please. You're not one of us.
Actually, I am. Crossed my name out and everything.
That only makes you half-immortal.
-Half? -You can't die of old age.
Oh, that's great!
But you can still die in battle.
Don't look at me. This was your plan.
Well, this is new information.
So, how exactly does one get full immortality?
You don't. Not possible.
Well, there is The Book of Everlasting Life, my lord.
-You shut your beard hole right now! -My bad.
-Stick, door! -[Stick murmurs]
Assistant, book! Monkey, stay handsome.
Whatever you do, don't let him leave with that book!
Let's go.
-[Lin groans] -Uh-oh.
-[Yama grunts] -[Monkey King] Make way!
Catch him! Catch him!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Monkey!
Ha! Well, that was fun. You got the book?
-Uh, um, uh… -You didn't lose it, did you?
Uh, uh-- You had one job!
One job and you blew it!
-Just messing with you! -Do you treat all your friends like this?
Friends? Whoa, okay. You're more like a teammate on my very critical mission.
Well, that's better than a pebble.
All right. Moving on. See this?
This book can tell us how I can get my full immortality.
-Uh… -What's it say? Okay. Uh, it says…
Oh. "Full immortality can be attained by eating a magical peach
from the Enchanted Orchard of Everlasting Life."
Ooh! Where's that?
This could take a while.
And I will give you five minutes.
This monkey's insane.
Oh really?
He gets in fights, insults the gods.
He just stole a book from hell! Oh yeah, did I mention? We went to hell!
Okay, let's bring the sass down to, like, a four, okay, sweetheart?
I can't keep this up. I can't do this.
Listen, honey, we made a deal.
There's no backing out now.
Or did you forget?
[sighs] I remember.
[Lin] I beseech you, divine dragon.
End our suffering.
Our crops are dying.
Could you please grace us with a rainstorm?
-[groans] We've been searching forever! -What?
Why aren't the "wanted" posters working?
But we put them up everywhere, Your Grace. There's one.
What is this?
I told you to draw the monkey, you dimwit!
But, sire, monkeys are so much harder to draw than sticks.
-No, wait, wait! -[yells] What the--
[gasps] Divine Master of Weather. Thank you for answering my call.
How dare you, a mere mortal, speak to his lordship.
-Avert your eyes. -[Lin] My apologies.
We have no food here. No water.
Could you please, please send us rain?
Well, aren't you a presumptuous little snack.
Wait, please!
I'll do anything. You must need something. An assistant. A servant.
A human servant? Ha!
He already has two perfectly good and trusted advisors.
We carry his tub.
[laughs] No! No. But perhaps our monkey would.
Monkey?
Would you lie for me? Get your paws dirty?
You'll have to be manipulative, vicious, and cunning.
Do you have that in you, you scrumptious, sweet little thing?
Because when you make a deal with me, you follow through or…
It's chapped lips for you! [laughs]
Benbo, he eats her.
Oh! Yeah, that too. [laughs]
Okay. I accept.
Befriend a certain monkey, earn his trust, and take his stick.
When it's in my possession,
you'll get your rain.
He never lets the stick out of his sight.
The sooner it's in my grip,
the faster you'll get your drip, drip, drip.
Well, now he's got me searching this stolen book
for some Orchard of Everlasting Life.
He's still trying to join the Immortal Ones? [laughs]
What a fool.
What should I do?
Hm. He wants an enchanted peach now, does he?
Oh, well, I'll just have to put on a little show and give him one. [laughs]
All you need to worry about is getting him there.
You sure this is the right way to get to that fancy peach orchard?
Yeah, definitely.
-[Monkey King grunts] Woo-hoo! -[Lin] Do you have to go top speed?
This? Ha! Please.
-I'll show you top speed. -No, no, no. I--
Hey!
Now, any personal assistant of mine really needs to be in the moment.
Yeah, yeah.
You need to be more focused and pay better attention.
I need to know you'll always have my back.
Monkey!
He's coming back. He's coming back.
[Monkey King] And my shoes perfectly shined.
He's not coming back!
It's the attention to detail that I value most.
Where to next? The hills? The desert?
Aw, man!
Trees.
So many trees.
I could've died peacefully in my village, but, no!
Chamber of Ridiculous Deaths, here I come.

Come on. Sell it.
Look at my little stinger!
-I'm adorable! -All right, Benbo, less is more.
He's never gonna buy this.
Does this look like an enchanted peach garden?
If you believe it, so will your audience. Here are the new sides.
Try not to step on each other's lines. Keep the scene contained.
I only had time to poison one tree.
The toxin should take only a few moments to knock him out cold.
Remember, the tree in the light has the peach he should bite.
If it's hidden by night, then the fruit isn't right. Got it?
Okay. If the tree is in light, then, um, uh…
-It's the peach he should bite. -Oh yeah. So definitely not that tree.
Yes, exactly that tree.
But that tree's not white. It's more of a brown.
No, not the color!
I lit it up for you. See?
Still nothing?
So, it's a glowing tree?
Exactly. Wow.
And once the monkey passes out, I'll grab the stick and--
Oh, here they come.
Everybody back to one. Hit your marks. And let's have some fun out there.
Whoopsie-daisy!
This one? No. That one.
Ugh. This peach grove looks kinda shabby. Are you sure this is--
Oh yeah. One bite of the magical fruit, and you get full immortality.

I'm not feeling anything special.
Hey, do I look immortal?
-Hm, well-- -Or maybe it's the tree over here.
That's ridiculous. The one in the light has the juiciest--
Stick to the pages!
Maybe it's this tree. The one in the dark. That's the most delicious.
Hold it. Let me check.
Nope. Definitely not as juicy as the one--
The tree in the dark…
Uh, what's wrong with this one?
…has the tastiest bark. [laughs]
That seems suspicious.
No, no, no, no. This is definitely the right tree.
-Eat it. -No, you eat it.
-No, you eat it. -No improv.
-You eat it first. -You eat it.
-[Monkey King] You eat it. -Come on. Just eat it. Yum.
How about at the same time?
Fine. Immortality, here I come.
I don't feel anything.
What?
Oh, wait. Maybe I do.
I feel good!
Me too!
Maybe you should just sit down.
Hey! Buzz off, lady, and mind your own…
Beeswax?
No! Beeswax.
Clear the stage. I'll take that stick. Thank you very much.
-Hey, I know you. -[Lin gasps]
Oh, your skin's all cleared up. You are gorgy!
You must be from the Dang Dynasty!
Hey, hey, you gotta try these peaches, man.
You idiot!
Don't you realize what's in those
yummy, mouth-watering… [slurps]
Who wants to take a bath with me?
I do!
Yay!
[Monkey King] We're hot-tubbing with the dragon!
[Dragon King] Everyone's gonna get crazy!
Oh man!
I loved those guys!
[groans] Those… Those are good people.
But the two of you are my best friends.
No. No, no, no, no. We're not friends.
The three of us, we're family.
What just… What just happened?
Dra… Uh, Dragon?
Monkey?
You awake?
-Agh! -Wait!
Did the peaches work? Am I fully immortal now?
-Knock my head off. -What?
Take my stick and whack me in the face. It's all right. Come on, come on. Do it.
I won't even feel it.
-[groans] Fine. I'll do it myself, wuss. -[Lin snarls]
Ow!
-Those peaches were defective. -Maybe they're out of season.
-Those peaches were defective. -Maybe they're out of season. -What? Our quest has failed, Stick. -[Stick groans]
-[groans] -You're still half-immortal.
I don't do half-things.
Yeah, I noticed.
This old geezer once told me all the things I couldn't do.
That I'd wind up alone.
Yeah. "You'll never amount to anything."
I heard that all the time back home. [sighs]
Wow.
Wish I could relate.
Well, thanks for your help.
-I mean, it was mostly me. -You're leaving?
-It was nice knowing you, little girl. -But no!
[grunts] Don't go. You said we were family.
-No, I didn't. -You did. Doesn't sound like me.
-Well, you said it. -That was just the peaches talking.
But you promised we'd do big things. We can't give up now.
"We"? Who's this "we"?
I'm still gonna join the Immortal Ones. -Just not with you. -[Lin groans]
You know what? I'm starting to think that wasn't even the real peach orchard.
What? [laughs awkwardly]
You think I… I deliberately brought you to the wrong place?
L-L-Like some sort of… Like some sort of trap?
You're saying I lied to you?
I'm not not saying it.
You know what? Go ahead. Walk away. You're so selfish.
You only care about yourself.
-Well, no one else will. -Ugh! 'Cause you won't let them.
Someday, you really will end up all alone.
-What are you yapping on about? -[Stick murmurs]
Who's that? Assistant, what does it say?
"An authority on everlasting life, the royal sorceress, Wangmu,
can often be found in her laboratory brewing her famous Elixir of Immortality."
We're back in the game! One sip and they'll have to accept me.
Way to go, Stick! Mwah!
You too, Pebble. What are we waiting for?
-But that's in heaven. -Monkey King reigns supreme!
Is that the Jade Palace?
Absolutely.
-[Monkey King] Woo-hoo! -What the--
[Lin] There she is. Wangmu.
[Lin] There she is. Wangmu. The queen of heaven.
Yeah, whatever. Let's go make me immortal.
Locked.
No. No, no, no! Monkey!
Somewhere in this room are the ingredients for making the Elixir of Immortality.
-Guess I'll just have to taste everything. -No. No. Wait.
-First thing we need is-- -Here goes nothing.
Hey, don't drink that.
-I'm just smelling it. -[Lin] Don't smell anything.
Uh, Monkey? -[Monkey King screeches] -[Lin yelps]
-Hey! -[Monkey King laughs]
[grunts] Okay, Lin. You got this.
Don't look back. Don't look back. Don't… look… back.
Aw, you're just a scared little monkey.
No friends. No family.
You are alone.
Sorry, Monkey.
I can't fool around anymore.
My people are counting on me.
-Oh! Agh! -Gee, why'd you trash this place?
-We're guests here. -[Lin groans] Show a little respect. Immortality Elixir?
Show a little respect. Immortality Elixir? Hello? Come on. I'm not paying you to goof around.
Yeah. Uh-huh.
-We're not actually paying her, are we? -[Stick hums]
Right. The first ingredient is…
There. A pinch of instant karma.
-Get mixing. -[woman] Stealing from an old lady?
You have no honor.
-Uh-oh. -[laughs] First, I punish you.
Then I shame you.
You can't shame me.
I have no shame.
And you have no exit.
Don't worry, kid. I'll take care of her.
Eat lightning, chimp! [laughs]
Immortality Elixir! Let's go!
A spoonful of chi. There! The blue jar.
A spoonful of chi coming up.
-[Monkey King] What's next? -A drop of moon essence. The green jar.
-[Monkey King] What's next? -A drop of moon essence. The green jar. -Bad monkey! -[Monkey King] On it.
-Bad monkey! -[Monkey King] On it.
Ha! Missed!
Yes!
-That's it. -[Monkey] What else?
Last one. Nectar of peach.
Yes! Um…
-Yes! -[Wangmu growls]
-Here you go. -[Wangmu] This is going to sting!
You call yourself a god? I'm so disappointed. What a bummer.
Um, it's stuck! I-I need a spoon or chopsticks or--
-Stick, help her. -[Stick yells]
-Perfect. -[Monkey King] Ha ha!
I think I did it!
-Taste this. [grunts] -Right.
Taste death!
That does it! [grunts]
[Monkey King] Nice punch, Grandma!
Your friend's not here to protect you now. [laughs]
Uh, we're not friends. I'm his assistant.
His what?
[screams] I'm just a pebble.
I'm only after his stick.
I need it to save my village from a drought.
So, the thief's assistant is also a thief. [laughs]
Take his stick and go! The Jade Emperor will see you home.
What are you going to do to him?
That selfish creature doesn't care about you.
Run!
Ha ha! Stick, where are you?
-Whoa! -Back for more, Monkey? -Uh-oh. -[panting] Don't look back!
-Uh-oh. -[panting] Don't look back! Don't look back! Don't look back.
-[Wangmu laughs] -No, not this time.
Goodbye, mortal.
Half-mortal.
You couldn't possibly think you were worthy to take your place here
amongst us Immortal Ones.
That was fun.
-Monkey! -Agh!
What?
I love it when people tell me what I can't do.
Whoa!
My lightning makes you stronger?
I'm immortal!
And huge!
I'm one of you now.
You will never be one of us!
-Monkey! -Who's gonna stop me?
I summon the Immortal Ones!
-I'm already here! -[Lin] They're coming! -We gotta get out of here! -What are they gonna do? I can't die.
-We gotta get out of here! -What are they gonna do? I can't die.
There are fates far worse than death.
We really should go now.
Bring 'em on! I am a god.
-Monkey! -What? I'm busy!
Bet you can't catch me.
Monkey King!
He's coming. He's coming. He's coming.
He's not coming!
You came back for me.
-What's your deal? -You came back for me!
I so could've beaten that old lady.
-But you didn't because you care. -No.
-Admit it. You care. Say it. -No!
-Say, "I care." -Never.
-Come on, admit it! -I admit nothing!
He so cares about me.
-[Stick murmurs] -I know!
He was all like, "We're not family. You're a tiny pebble."
-And then he saves me! [laughs] -[Stick laughs]
Are you two done? 'Cause I got to get to the Jade Palace.
-To do what? -Defeat all the Immortal Ones.
Then I'll become their ruler, the new king of heaven.
Wait. Are you sure? Sounds kinda crazy.
Yep! Whatever the Monkey King does, he does big!
-And you won't ever stop? -Not until the day I die.
-Which is? -Never! I'm immortal!
My thirst for new challenges will never end.
I'll never be satisfied. I'll never be fulfilled.
Which, when I say it out loud, sounds incredibly depressing.
Wow! Did I just curse myself?
Maybe defeating everyone isn't always the answer.
Maybe you'd find happiness by,
I don't know, helping other people?
-That could be your new, uh, path. -Hm.
Say you could save a starving village by lending out the stick for--
My stick? Okay. How about I rip off my tail and give that away too? I mean, come on.
Okay. How about I rip off my tail and give that away too? I mean, come on.
You could save the lives of so many.
Hard pass.
Me and Stick are meant for way bigger things.
You wanna be happy, you help people.
You can do great things.
I'm just a mortal.
You're the only mortal I know who's gone to hell and heaven in one day.
That wasn't my accomplishment. That was you.
When we were in hell, I read my scroll.
It said, "Lin, common peasant girl."
"Tried to make a difference. Never did."
[sighs] Does it have to end that way?
I don't know. Who's Lin?
I'm Lin.
Oh! Hey, Lin. Monkey King. Nice to meet ya.
Pleasure.
Buck up, Lin. No one thought I could make a difference, right?
But now look at me. The original outsider.
Fully immortal!
So don't let anyone,
god, demon, old monkeys,
challenge you or stand in your way.
You want something,
don't ask.
-Just take it. -[Stick grunts]
-I've got a challenge. -Go on.
-It's a big one. -I'm listening.
How long do you think an immortal monkey can hold his breath under that water?
Interesting.
I dunno.
Two, three years! [inhales deeply]
Don't be sad. You've done good, girl.
Go home. Your storm is coming.
Ah, I wasn't gonna make you wait the whole three.
Forget it. Come on. Grab Stick, and we'll--
-Where's Stick? -I had no choice.
-He just needs to borrow it. -Borrow it?
-Where did you get that? -The Dragon King just--
Dragon King?
My village is dying.
My family is dying.
The Dragon King can help them.
I trusted you, Lin. I saved you.
I saved you first. And I asked for your help.
You said if I want something, don't ask. Just take it.
-That's what you said. -[Monkey King growls]
I had to do it.
Well, hello, you.
That stick belongs to me!
Stickipoo here had a momentary fling,
but now he's come home.
In fact, he'll be the guest of honor at my celebration tonight.
Invite only.
And a warm thanks to you for the help, my child.
Tell your village the drought is over.
It's all over.
For you, your people, and the entire world!
The world?
No, we have to stop him.
-You betrayed me! -I had no choice.
-We're still family, right? -I have no family.
-I'll help you get Stick back. -Help me?
You? An insignificant pebble?
This monkey heroes alone!
I'll show you crazy.
Monkey!
But he destroyed my home.
Oh, Wangmu, if you can't stop a little monkey from smashing your roof--
[Babbo] Coming to the stage…
[Benbo] To finally kick off his world domination tour…
He's flashy.
He's splashy.
But don't mention his rashy.
[Benbo] Put your fins and tentacles together for…

I believe I said invite only!
What do we do now?
I am the mighty Dragon King,
world-flooder, man-slayer--
Monkey punching-bag!
-Stop it! -Yeah!
Knock it off!
Monkey!
[Dragon King grunts] Stop!
-[Lin] I got ya. Head for high ground! -[child] Mama!
Everybody, get to the top of the hill!
Stop wrecking my clones!
-Monkey! You're not alone. I can help you! -[Monkey King snarls]
[Dragon King groans] Gotcha!
-[dramatic music plays] -Why won't you die?
I'm immortal, dummy!
How?
Those peaches were fake!
-[Lin] Dragon! -What?
-Your Majesty! -What?
[Lin] Spare my poor village, and I'll tell you his weakness.
Agreed.
Lightning. It's the only thing that can defeat him.
Fry him up. No one'll miss him.
-Jia you! Jia you! -[Monkey King grunts]
-Stick? -[Stick hums]
[Babbo] Oh no, not again!
-I missed you so much. -[Stick murmurs]
Thanks for the assist, child.
I'm not your assistant!
I'm his.
What?
This is so twisted!
Yes! That's it! Wring him out!
Monkey?
Okay, you can have the stick!
How about I get custody just on weekends?
Are we fired?
Oh yeah, we need a new career.
You did it. You defeated the Dragon King--
Monkey King reigns supreme!
Uh-oh.
Sir, you, uh…
[sighs] What is it now?
You're next.
[Jade Emperor] This has gone too far.
Hand me the Royal Horn of Desperation.
But the Buddha said to let him find his own way.
[scoffs] The Buddha speaks in riddles. No one understands him.
This ends now!
Monkey!
You shall spend your immortality alone,
reflecting on your crimes.
My crimes?
You could have accepted me.
Now I will reign supreme over all of you!
Monkey! Stop!
-[Yama] Monkey! -[Monkey King laughs]
Monkey! Monkey!
It's me! It's Lin!
-[Monkey King growls] -Please, you have to stop.
No, Monkey!

[Monkey King] ♪ Monkey King! ♪

Please, he's not evil.
-[Monkey King laughs] -[Lin] He has goodness inside him.
He does care.
[Buddha] Then help him find his way.
[Lin] What's happening?
[Buddha] Enlighten him.
What? But how do I do that?
Monkey King, stop!
Oh, whoa.
[deep voice] Monkey King, stop!
Buddha?
Monkey King is my old title.
You will address me as the Great Sage,
equal of heaven!
How can we show him he's not the center of the universe?
I got it! [deep voice] I have a challenge for you, Great Sage.
Not interested!
-What is it? -[Lin as Buddha] Something worthy of you.
The ultimate challenge.
What gives?
[Lin as Buddha] If you are powerful enough to leap from my palm,
the kingdom of heaven will be yours to rule.
Hang on. What did he just say?
[deep voice] But if you fail, you will do a long penance here on Earth.
Please. Too easy! [laughs]
I just have to leave your hand?
You're on, but you're gonna feel pretty foolish in about two sec…
Cloud jump!
-[cat yelps] -I really hate that monkey.
This is the edge of the universe, Stick!
-[Stick squeals] -[Monkey King] I rule!
Yeah, I totally should. Just to prove I was here.
Ha ha! And now to make my other mark.
-[Monkey King sighs] -[Lin as Buddha] Stop that, Monkey.
Uh, the Great Sage.
[Lin as Buddha] You never left my hand, Monkey King.
Wait a second. No! No. No, no, no, no, no! No! No!
Whatever just happened, that's cheating! Do-over!
Hard pass.
-Pebble? -[Lin laughs] -Are you even supposed to be in there? -Absolutely not. Isn't it great?
-Are you even supposed to be in there? -Absolutely not. Isn't it great?
You tricked me! Not fair! That's two against one.
I'm sorry. This is the only way to help you.
Stop! No, no, no, no, no! No! [strains]
No! Stick!
Well, guess what?
[grunts] This is so exactly what I wanted to happen.
Told you, you'd feel foolish. Ha ha.
[Buddha] Monkey King,
you are now on the path of meditation and self-reflection.
I was born from a rock, you know?
This is where I thrive! Monkey King reigns supreme! [strains]
[Buddha] When you awake to nothingness,
you will have found your way.
Awake to nothingness.
Whatever that means.
I'll think about it.
He's just a little monkey looking for a place to belong.
[Buddha] The Monkey King's scroll
is still to be written.
When he is ready,
the world will need him
as it has needed you.
Hey, Lin, where's our hero going today?
I'll be back by sunset.
[Babbo] And two extra-large milk tea bobas.
Want honey with that? I made it myself.
My gosh! How do I awaken to nothingness?
What does that even mean?
Be calm? Patient? Humble?
I'm the king of being humble!
[Lin] Monkey? Monkey.
Go away! I'm busy thinking of all the ways to get back at you.
Calmly.
I came to say goodbye before Buddha closes up your mountain.
Oh, lucky me.
I know you're mad, but you were out of control.
[groans] Okay, you don't have to remind me.
Taking on all the gods probably wasn't my best idea.
I really messed up, didn't I?
Monkey, you were born from a rock,
abandoned by everyone.
Th-The gods hated you,
and all you ever wanted was to be loved.
[Lin] And you are!
You changed my life.
I made a difference. We both did.
I really am your number one fan.
Well, I guess a little pebble did make a big wave.
With an assist.
Oh, that's good.
Me, your assistant?
Okay. Okay.
We helped each other.
Well, we didn't do it all alone.
Stick! Buddy! I missed you so much!
The team is back.
I guess this is goodbye.
Wait, don't go yet. [grunts]
Thank you for everything.
I'll miss you, Monkey.
Keep writing your scroll, Lin.
I will.
[Lin] I kept my promise and did great things.
And Monkey, I'm sure he'll be out in no time.
Monkey, demons run wild across the land.
The Buddha sent us to release you.
Are you ready to join our journey to the West?
I have awoken with peace in my heart,
and you wish for me to fight?
Well, yes, but--
Come on, Stick. The world needs us.

Look.
Got you some dinner.
This is dessert.
Who says dessert can't be dinner?
-[Amber] Uh, nutritionists? -[chuckles]
You telling me nutritionists don’t like cheesecake?
This is from the Copper Kettle.
Did you sit at the bar?
I had one glass of wine.
-Just one. -You're not supposed to have any.
But it was-- It was just one.
So Oliver’s back in the picture now?
No! No, not really. This just-- This is a way to get us some dinner.
This isn't dinner, Mom.
You were supposed to look at apartments, not get cheesecake from Oliver.
Well, that's all that he could give me, so I took it,
and I'm sorry that it's not good enough for you.
That's not...
Oh, it's so good.
Oh, it's really good, Mom, actually.
Here.
-No. I don't want any. -Have some. Don't be mad.
-Just a little bite. I promise. -I'm not mad.
It's the best cheesecake I've ever had and you're saying no.
-Right? -Yes!

[Ricky] My BB-8 clock said 7:12.
Yesterday, it was 7:13.
Tuesday, it was 7:14.
[Amber] What's your point?
You're waking me up a minute earlier every day.
You're on to me. The master plan is to eventually wake you up at 4:00 a.m.
Then midnight?
Then yesterday.
Before I even go to sleep!
Which would totally suck, but might be sort of cool,
because then we could eat breakfast together and stay up all night.
Uh-huh. Your mom's home.
She's early, too.
-It's a conspiracy. -[Ricky] No!
[Amber chuckles] Good morning, Donna.
-Hey, you two. -Hey, Mom.
How was work?
The night shift. It's, uh... life's rich pageant.
[Donna] Amber! Ty's here!
Please, don't get up.
[Donna] Amber!
You left this on the counter.
Right. Thank you.
-Bye, Mom. -Bye, sweetie.
Have a great day, Amber.
Always.
Hendrix? Fox and Fox.
-Hey, Amber. -Hey.
Hey.
Hi.
Hey, Jordan, is that a coloring book?
Because there are Marquez all over the pages.
Impressive.
Thanks.
We've had 31 days of school, that's 31 rides.
Thirty-one sandwiches, too, am I right?
-So many sandwiches. -Okay, seriously, Ty deserves a sandwich
because he has to leave the house way earlier than the rest of us.
-And I'm the only one who owns a car. -That's true.
-A car? Okay. Well, this... Not a car. -Technically, I don't think you own it.
He's the only one with access to a car.
-Yes, thank you. Access. -[Jordan] Call it a vehicle.
I still fail to see how any of this warrants a sandwich.
-Thank you. -Just sayin'.
I think Amber's got a crush on Ty. That's why she makes him a sandwich.
Do you guys realize the marching band's been playing all year without a tuba?
Somebody stole it over the summer.
Yeah, look at Ryan Gold. She looks weird.
[Chad] She looks sad.
They’ve played half the football season without it.
Now that state championships are coming up, if they don’t have a tuba,
-they’re automatically disqualified. -Okay, but who steals a tuba?
Someone who’s really horny for it.
[Jordan] It’s technically a sousaphone.
You could get a lot of cash for one on the dark web.
Why don't they get another one? Borrow it or rent it, I don't know.
Sure, Ty. Why don’t you just lend Ryan your extra tuba?
-"Sousaphone." -Nobody’s stepped up.
About three, four grand should do it for a proper marching model.
Is she on the dark web right now?
I say we make the tuba this year’s cause for the Variety Show.
Doesn't the school decide that?
Amber runs the Variety Show. She started it.
But how do we get people excited over a tuba?
Oh, my God, "sousaphone."
I don't know, but we have to. Just look at Ryan.
-Hey, Amber. -Hey, Leah.
Leah is awesome. You know, she's auditioning for Oklahoma! this year?
Is that right?
-You know where this is going, Ty. -Yeah, I do.
Come on! Mr. Franks thinks you'd make a great Curly. We all do.
-We need you this year. -I don't know.
Getting on stage in front of all those people, it's terrifying.
You play soccer in front of all those people.
Yeah, but I don't have to bust out with a show tune. [scoffs]
Or wear a cowboy hat.
I think you'd look great in a cowboy hat.
I've been trying to text you, but I keep on getting delivery failure.
Yeah. Uh, that's a whole thing.
I lost my phone, and I haven't had a chance to get a new one yet.
I was hoping we could have, like...
a private conversation.
Cell phones aren't private. It's much better to stay off-grid.
Plus, I'm the only teenager in all of America who doesn't have a cell phone.
How cool is that?
Not cool at all?
[Ty] So, it--it takes place in, um, I'm assuming Oklahoma.
[Ricky] Yes! So, that's why...
That's why we're trying to bring you in.
-All right, you got it. -That whole dynamic going on...
Hey, guys.
-Hey, Mr. Franks. -Franks!
Dig your shirt. Mr. Franks.
That's very nice of you. Thank you very much.
Yeah, what's, uh, going on over there?
You know, it's just sort of some outdoor tableaus.
You know, some people listening to music, and sitting on a park bench.
-Trees, and tennis, and... -[Jordan] It's stylish. I like it.
[Ty] I like it. Do one of 'em have a-- One has a mullet.
-It's very '80s. I like that. -[Chad] Yeah, it's very you. We approve.
-Franks. -[Franks] Not necessarily the '80s, but...
-Oh, maybe it is. -Mr. Franks?
Appleton?
[Amber] Can I show you something?
Sure.
-Just... -What am I looking at?
Whoa!
Wow, look at that!
-Does that mean that I-- -Yeah.
You're being asked to audition at Carnegie Mellon.
-Amber's going to Pittsburgh. Look! -What?
Of course she is.
-That's amazing. -No way!
[Chad] This is your dream, Amber.
That's incredible! Oh, my God!
[Chad] What song are you going to sing?
[Ricky] Pittsburgh? How are you going to get to Pittsburgh?
Good boy.
Mom?
Hey.
Bobby.
Hey.
I'm sorry, baby.
I was so tired, I just fell asleep.
At Oliver's.
You have his truck.
He's asked us to move in.
And I think we should do it.
So everything's fine now?
He has a good side.
Yeah, and a bad side.
We're gonna get caught.
And it is getting cold outside.
I'd rather freeze my ass off on a bus than go back to Oliver's.
Why? He wants to help,
and we still don't have enough money for an apartment.
What if we tried the shelter again?
No, I'm not going to the shelter. No.
So that I can have people questioning my parenting?
No one can find out about us. You understand?
Because if they do, I'll lose you.
Let's just talk about this when you're in a better mood.
I got invited to audition for Carnegie Mellon.
What?
My God.
Your dad would be so proud.
How does it work? You sing for them?
Yeah. And then they crush my dreams.
They won't. You're gonna be great.
How am I even gonna get to Pittsburgh?
You've been saving money, right?
Yeah, for an apartment, not some stupid audition.
No, you buy that ticket.
Because this is your dream.
You see?
Things are lookin' up.
We're gonna be great.
Without Oliver.
Okay. [sighs]
Okay.
So what's with you today?
You're not yappin' all over the game like you usually do.
Nothing. I'm just thinking.
About that boyfriend of yours?
I don't have a boyfriend.
Ty's a friend. We're buds.
"Buds." Buds, yeah.
Have you hooked up with him yet?
Joan!
Get over it, and quit wasting your time thinking.
Youth is precious, so you should enjoy it.
That's the most positive thing I think I've ever heard you say.
Well, it's just another way of saying that life is nasty, brutish, and short.
And then you die.
That's my Joanie.
Okay, Ricky. Egg puns. Go.
Oh, um, okay.
Well, I only know a few, so this will be over easy.
Omelet you use that one if you want.
Okay.
You can poach it.
Ooh, nice.
Yeah, it's funny, because...
I usually only eat eggs around hollandaise.
-Good morning, honey. -Good morning, Mom.
-Hey. -Sorry, did we wake you up?
No, I was up already.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah.
I noticed you've been using my makeup.
Oh. Donna, I'm so sorry.
It's okay. I used to dip into my sister's makeup all the time,
but it's kind of gross. So...
I got you this.
Thank you.
But I can't take this.
What do you mean? Sure you can.
No, I just-- I don't wear makeup.
I was practicing. I'm really sorry.
It's a gift.
I know, and it's really great. I just--
I don't need it.
Amber, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm great. Never better.
Poetry. Sweet. Thank you.
The tuba's a great cause, and I know you'd shine up there.
I don't have any real skills, Amber.
Sure, you do. When you close your eyes, what do you imagine yourself doing?
Tommy, you're going to kill it.
But what if I eat it?
You won't! You won't!
Okay. Okay, fine. Fine.
-Awesome, can't wait to hear it. -Thank you.
Thanks so much.
Okay. So, Ricky's gonna do a pun-off.
-Put me down as Lingo Starr. -I love it.
Chad, you're going to wow us with some thespianism, right?
-That's the plan. -Awesome. Ty?
Uh, I thought I'd stage manage. Help out with the behind-the-scenes stuff.
Come on! You've gotta do something up there. You're so talented.
He’s only good at soccer as far as we know.
[Chad] He does have some talent.
Exactly! And this is your chance to show everyone
how very talented you are, and also charismatic.
So, think about it, please?
-Okay, yeah, I'll think about it. -Yes! All right.
Jordan?
I'll be performing an Argentine tango.
-Oh. -An Argentine tango.
Correct.
I can finally tell you my sister watches a little too much Dancing with the Stars.
A, That is a lie. B, please put me down for an Argentine tango.
You do realize it takes two human beings to tango, right?
Put me down as “Jordan and TBD.”
Okay. Uh, Franksie?
Me? No. This is for you guys.  I'm not gonna get involved.
-What? Are you kidding? -Come on, man. Really?
-You have to help us out. -[Ricky] Do it.
-Are you sure? -[Amber] Yes, we're sure.
All right. I'll think of something. "All the world's a stage.
The end."
Right? Is that what it is? I don't know. I have work to do, guys.
[Amber] Two-forty, 260, 280, 300.
Okay, you know the school can help foot the bill for this.
There's this discretionary fund for students in need.
Okay, but I'm not in need. I am flush.
All right. One ticket to Pittsburgh, coming right up.
Carnegie Mellon will not know what hit them.
What's going on?
They found out.
Who found out?
Who do you think?
I got fired.
Good riddance. [scoffs]
You're drunk.
I got fired.
I got fired. I had two drinks. I'm not drunk.
How did they find out?
I don't know.
Did you say something?
Did we leave something behind?
It doesn't matter. They found out.
Who was that?
Oliver's coming to pick us up.
I can't believe you.
Amber!
Hey.
Yeah.
I know. I'm sorry.
We'll just sit here.
No, no, no.
My backpack.
I had my money in there.
My school books.
My dad's hoodie.
It's all gone.
It's okay.
Hey, it's okay.
No, it's not.
I don't know what to do, Ty.
My mom's gonna be looking for me,
and I can't go back to Oliver's.
Let's just...
Let's think about this, okay?
Today's Saturday.
We don't have school on Monday.
I have an idea.
Just...
trust me, okay?
[Ty] It’s a really important audition, Mom.
I thought the peace and quiet would do Amber a lot of good.
Plus, we've got such a good piano up here,
I don't see why we wouldn't use it.
Yeah.
No, I get that. I'm sorry. You're right. I should have told you.
She's just a friend, Mom.
Nobody's going to be partying up here, we're gonna be practicing.
"Feels Like Home."
My dad wrote it.
He was...
an amazing musician.
And singer.
Runs in the family, I guess.
You want to try it?
All right, ready when you are.

How did I sound?
[Ty] Terrible.
I'm sorry, but you have zero talent.
It was just...
That was embarrassing. I was embarrassed for you.
Yeah, you're the worst.
He wrote that song for my mom.
I was twelve.
It was a heart thing.
Never even knew anything was wrong with it.
My mom tried to keep it together.
She just didn't have any family around.
So little by little, things started to go downhill.
When we got evicted, we moved in with Oliver.
First night we got there, they went out drinking.
She'd been sober for five months.
Then one night, he hit her.
And we moved out,
to the bus.
We're going to figure something out, all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good morning!
It's pretty nice, huh?
No.
-What's so funny? -[laughing]
Thanks.
This has been really great.
Anytime.
You sure about this?
Yeah. I trust Donna.
Oh, hey, Amber.
Ricky's over at Chad and Jordan's practicing for the Variety Show.
Yeah, I actually came to see you.
Okay.
I need to tell you something.
I don't understand what's going on here.
We just want to discuss some things with you, Becky.
Well, I, uh, came here to pick up my daughter,
because she was missing all weekend and I was worried sick,
and I don't really want to discuss anything with you.
So, Amber, let's go.
Don't look at her.
What are you looking at her for?
Amber wants you to know she doesn't feel comfortable living at Oliver's.
Oh.
So you two talked about everything, huh?
Well, it may not be comfortable, but that is where we live now.
I don't wanna live there again.
I don't feel safe.
You felt safer living on a bus?
I just think--
I don't care what you think.
Amber, let's go.
Donna says I can stay here for a few nights, until we figure this out.
No. Absolutely not. No.
-[Donna] It's okay, Becky. -No, it's not.
Who-- Who do you think you are? Really?
It is not okay.
She is my daughter. She stays with me.
-Calm down. -I am calm.
I'm not going anywhere with you until you move out of Oliver's.
If you keep her here, I'm calling the cops.
Well, maybe that's not a bad idea.
Maybe we all need to have a conversation about this.
I'm the mother.
I'm the one that keeps things together.
Really, Mom? You do that? I had no idea.
I'm trying.
Can't you-- You can't see that I'm trying to take care of you?
I'm doing my best.
Well, your best isn't good enough.
Okay.
Then stay here.
Stay here for the rest of your life for all I care.
Mom!
Mom!
Don't go back there. Please?
Then where do I go?
What am I supposed to do?
You need help.
And we can get you help. We can start over.
[softly] "Start over."
Life is so much more complicated than you think, baby.
You got everything you need?
-Yeah. -Okay.
I'm really sorry for putting you in the middle of all this.
Hey, no.
You have nothing... nothing to be sorry about.
Just... try to get some rest, okay?
Okay.
Good night.
Good night, Donna.
[teacher] The Executive Branch had three departments.
There was the Department of State,
which was led by Thomas Jefferson.
There was the Department of Treasury, -which was led by-- -[door opens]
[softly] Hey. I need to speak with Amber.
Oh, sure. Uh, Amber?
Ooh!
Okay, that's enough.
Amber, bring your things.
Have a seat.
Amber, this is Officer Rozick and Officer Garland.
I know what this is about.
My mom called, right?
I'll be right outside.
Amber, your mother, Rebecca Appleton,
was involved in an automobile accident early this morning.
We're sorry to have to tell you, but she died of her injuries
on the way to the hospital.
[Rozick] Amber, do you have any friends or relatives you can stay with tonight?
Yeah.
[Rozick] Okay. We'll need to contact them.
We also need you to come with us to answer a few questions.
Was she driving?
[Garland] She was the passenger.
The driver... also died in the collision.
Did anyone else get hurt?
[Rozick] It was a single-vehicle accident.
He was drunk.
Oliver. He was drunk, right?
They both were.
[Garland] The cause of the accident is still being investigated.
I'm sorry. I need to use the bathroom.
[Ty] That's why I think it makes more sense if Leah comes after.
[Jordan] Right. And then I follow.
-[Ty] That works. -[Chad] Yeah.
What do you think, Amber?
Hmm?
Should I go before or after Leah's juggling act?
Uh, it's... Whatever you guys want.
-After's fine. -Yeah. Yeah, that'd be good.
When a verb ends in a silent "e," drop the "e"
and add "ed" to form the past tense.
"Joke" to "joked." "Hope" to "hoped."
Aren't we going to sing, Amber?
No. Not today.
[woman] Oh, but we love singing.
Sorry.
I bet you're sick of people asking you if you're okay.
I ran away from her.
I went to your fancy vacation house.
I had fun while she needed me.
Amber...
this is not your fault.
Then I came back, and I pushed her away.
This is on me.
Hey.
Ready for Pittsburgh tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
Listen, I can only imagine how hard it is for you right now.
But...
you know, your talent,
the reason you earned this opportunity,
that's still there. That doesn't go away.
It's still in here.
So, the pain that you're feeling,
you know, the grief...
I think you just-- just channel it.
Channel it, put it into your song.
Because that's what an artist does.
And you... You're an artist.
Thank you, Mr. Franks.
You have to finish your food, you can't just stare at it.
So your flight's at nine.
I figured we'd leave for the airport at 7:00 a.m. the latest,
maybe even 6:30.
And, um, you're all set up for the dorm
and the student is gonna show you around.
Yeah.
You have enough money for the cab?
Yeah, I'm good.
Bobby?
Bobby.
No, no, no.
How is he?
Bobby has a mass on his spleen.
That's what's been causing his discomfort.
A mass? Is that cancer?
I don't know yet.
But either way, the treatment is exactly the same...
We'll need to do surgery to remove the mass.
If that's successful, he could make a full recovery.
[Donna] Amber, where have you been?
You missed your flight.
Is everything okay?
No.
[Amber] So that's twelve dollars an hour.
Uh, and the most I could work is a ten-hour shift?
And overtime is time-and-a-half.
Okay, thank you, Lloyd. I appreciate it.
How's he feeling?
[Amber] I gave him another painkiller.
Well, um, I explained everything to the Admissions Office,
and they were very understanding.
I think they can get you another audition slot.
I'm not going.
Amber, if it's about the plane ticket,
-you don't have to-- -I can't audition, Donna.
Not until Bobby gets better.
[Ricky] Lloyd has hired Amber full-time at the donut shop.
Also, she added to her hours at the retirement home.
If she works 70 hours a week at minimum wage,
she could pay for Bobby's surgery in ten-and-a-half weeks.
You can't work 70 hours a week and go to school.
I'm dropping out.
Dropping out? Amber, honey.
No, you can't do that, you can't throw everything away.
Donna, I really appreciate everything you've done--
It's not about that. It's about you and your future.
You have so much to look forward to, and so much talent. I can't let you--
Stop!
You're not her.
You're not who?
[Ty] What's going on?
You can't just drop out of school.
Ty, look, I am so tired. I just can't right now.
Look, I'm really sorry about Bobby.
He's awesome. And I know that he's really important to you, but--
Don't.
Don't say he's just a dog.
Because he's not. Not to me.
Okay.
You need money, right?
Let me help you. I can ask my parents.
-I'm handling it. -Listen to me, it can be a loan.
Okay? You can pay them back slowly while you finish school--
Ty, stop! I have this under control.
Damn it, Amber, you are so stubborn!
You do so much for other people,
but when you need just a little bit of help, you push us all away.
What is so bad about needing help?
Like, if you don't do this on your own, you're weak?
Good job, Ty,
you figured it out.
I bet part of you is glad that you missed the audition.
Bobby got sick,
and you got an excuse to punish yourself for letting your mom down,
which you didn't do.
You're suffering.
You're suffering, and you won't admit it.
You expect the rest of us to sit by and watch you go down the drain,
and that is not fair!
"Not fair?"
I'm sorry, that must really suck, life not being fair.
You know what you should do to make yourself feel better?
I don't know, you should hang out with your two parents at your vacation home.
Maybe that'll help you get over life and its vast unfairness.
-Amber-- -Leave me alone!
Just leave me alone.
Thank you.
Take the rack, both sides in,
and you slowly...
drop them into the oil.
You wanna try it?
Sure.
[Amber] Good boy. Good boy.
You know, it's a lot easier watching it this way.
What do you mean?
Well, my ears don't hurt from all your loud singing,
and talking, and terrible jokes.
In fact, if you happen to see the old Amber,
well, you can tell her that...
it was a living hell just being around her.
All that disgusting cheer and helpfulness.
Optimism.
Well, she was insufferable.
Hey.
Hi.
I can't go.
You've been putting this show on for the last three years.
It's the last one you'll ever get to see.
It's your night.
Sorry.
I have to finish my shift.
[Lloyd] No, you don't.
We're closed.
No. We close at midnight.
Usually, but we're out of donuts.
These have been impounded.
Lloyd...
Amber.
Go. Be with your friends.
I got this.
Why are all those people here?
Must be really into supporting brass instruments, I guess.
Ty, that's way too many people for the Variety Show.
You think it's a lot of people?
I feel like there's...
a normal amount of people. Um...
Okay. All right. Yeah. Um...
We ended up changing the...
We ended up changing the proceeds to going to Bobby Big Boy's surgery.
-What? -I know. Yeah, I know.
Look, before you-- before-- before this gets out of hand,
I want to say something. I want to say that I'm sorry.
Okay?
I want to say that I'm sorry about the other--
Well, you know, I was...
I was way too hard on you.
I was frustrated.
I was frustrated because I care about you...
a lot.
All of these people care about you.
They showed up for you. Okay?
So for once, you're gonna have to deal with that, all right?
What if I don't know how?
Think of it as a gift.
Okay? Think of it as a gift that you're giving us
by letting us help you.
Amber.
Trust us.
We won't let you down.
Just over here.
Hi, Bobby. Hi, Bobby.
Have a seat, the show's about to start.
Where are you going to sit?
Good evening, everyone,
and welcome to the "Save Bobby Big Boy" Variety Show!
Now, we have some amazing acts lined up for you tonight.
But before we get to those, I wanted to make a few opening remarks.
As we all know,
Amber Appleton puts together this Variety Show every year
to raise money for various school causes.
She's also helped the Drama Club mount their productions,
has lobbied the school board for better wheelchair access,
and has made me countless delicious fried-egg sandwiches.
She teaches, she volunteers.
She's... sorta like a rock star.
Just by being here tonight, she has helped me get over my...
my massive, massive stage fright.
Honestly, I don't know, maybe. I still might throw up, we'll see.
[Ty] Now...
even though it's really tough for her to admit,
Amber needs us.
Our goal tonight is to raise $8,000,
so that her dog, Bobby Big Boy, can get a life-saving operation.
We have raised over $2,000 in ticket sales alone so far.
So, please, get out your phones
and tweet, Instagram, Facebook, live stream,
anything you can to help get the word out.
So, let's get to our first act.
Do you bite your thumb at me, sir.
I do bite my thumb, sir.
Do you bite your thumb at me, sir?
No, sir. I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I do bite my thumb, sir.
-Do you quarrel, sir? -Quarrel, sir?
Draw, if you be men.
Yes, Jordan!
All right, let's refresh our page and see where we are.
Yes, we're getting there.
-Please, keep spreading the word. -[cheers and applause]
Next up, we have the punniest man alive.
Give it up for Ricky Lingo Starr Roberts!
I'm here to talk to you about man's best friend.
Well, one man's best friend. Mine.
She's a human woman. Not a dog...
but she's got a great one in Bobby Big Boy.
Things lately,
they got a little ruff for these two,
but we're here to give triple-B a new leash on life.
I can say Lapso-lutely amazing things about Amber,
but you all might Terrier your hair out.
And I don't want Amber to sit there
and Rottweiler friends Schnauzer off in front of everyone.
So embarrassed of all the Shih Tzu here,
that she Pekingese eyes out from behind her hands.
I'll keep things Pug-ressing for a Spaniel be able to handle,
and then Retriever.
[Ricky] Amber...
you Mastiff known I would take this speech,
and Basset on the fact that you're a Great Dane...
and my best friend in the whole world.
Thank you.
All right, let's take another look at where we are.
Almost $6,000. Yes.
Let's keep those pledges coming in.
And now, for our last act of the night,
ladies and gentlemen, the Korean Divas,
accompanied by our very own McKinley High marching band,
and their brand new tuba.
[Jordan] Sousaphone!
How'd they get the tuba?
I don't know. Ricky said something about the "dark web."
Ladies and gentlemen, The Korean Divas and the McKinley High Marching Band!
Okay, let's take another look.
Six thousand, three hundred and four dollars.
Wow.
I'd like to thank all the acts, everybody who contributed.
It's been an awesome night. Thank you so, so much.
Now, we didn't quite make our goal, but we'll keep the page open.
So please keep spreading the word.
Everybody, our guest of honor, Amber Appleton!
Wow. Uh...
This is overwhelming. I'm not...
a hundred percent sure this is happening yet.
But I'm so happy that the marching band got their tuba.
Hope is the thing with feathers.
My mom loved that poem.
We'd read it at bedtime for...
as long as I can remember.
It's about finding hope,
even in the darkest of times.
My mom always had hope,
and so did I.
Until I lost it.
But you all helped me find it again.
I don't know how to repay you.
But I guess that's the point.
I don't have to repay you.
I just have to take the gift that you've given me
and use it.
And I will.
So, thank you.
I'm so grateful.
Should we take one last look at our total?
[all] Yeah!
[boy] Whoo-hoo! Do it!
Is this a joke?
Um, can we get a refresh on that, please?
I think it's real.
Ty, did you--
No!
No. I promise you, I had nothing...
I don't know.
Then...
Looks like we got an anonymous donation of $200,000,
bringing our total to $206,844.
[Amber] Hi, Mr. Linder.
It's me, Amber Appleton.
Do you remember me?
Are we related?
No, I work here on the weekends,
but I had some extra donuts, so I thought I'd stop by.
You want one?
Hmm.
What's this?
Well, just open it.
Oh, for God's sake, it's not a bomb. Open it.
[Joan] Told you I'd make you cry.
Joan...
No.
Yes.
What am I supposed to do with all that dough, huh?
Line my coffin with it?
I don't have any family left.
Well, that's not exactly true.
Actually, you're my family.
And you can make better use of it than anyone else I know.
Oh...
Oh, God, no. No more waterworks. I only wanted to see it the one time.
Well, I can't help that.
Come here.
Oh.
[Donna] Wake up, sweetie.
Hey, Bobby.
Good boy.
-Bye. -Bye.
-Bye, Bobby. -♪ Feeling is all I have ♪

-[vomits] -[Cal] Hey, hey.
-[sighs] -[Cal] Here's some water, okay?
[Cal] Ugh... You okay?
Shouldn't I be over morning sickness by now?
I mean, every woman's body is different, right?
Oh, yeah? What do you know about women's bodies?
Not enough.
You're not worried, are you?
No.
Just thinking.
What?
What? What?
Uh...
Maybe we should go back.
-We're halfway to San Diego. -I know.
I know.
I just...
[sighs] It's just been hard to know for sure.
Dad must think I'm an idiot.
[sighs] Look, Beck, I know it's not in your nature to put yourself first,
but in this case, I don't think you should take Mom and Dad's feelings into account.
I don't think you should take my feelings into account.
I don't think you should even take the baby's needs into account.
Okay?
This is about you.
Yeah.
Guess I'll have another 1,500 miles to decide, right?
Right.
-Let's just get back on the road and... -[boy] Help!
-...not worry about any of this. -Did you hear that?
Hear what?
[boy] Help!
Help!
Hello?
Is someone out there?
[boy] Help!
I'm lost in here.
Sounds like he's really in trouble.
[boy] I've been trying to get to the road,
-but I can't find it! -[sighs]
Okay.
We'd better haul him out.
It's really hot.
Careful. Don't slide down into that ditch.
Watch your arm. I'm gonna pull this thing off the side of the road.
Kid.
Hey, kid, can you hear me?
[boy] Yes!
Help me!
I've been stuck in here for days!
[woman] Tobin? Stop calling.
Stop calling, honey.
Hello? What's going on?
[Tobin] We're lost!
Please! Please help!
[woman] No! Tobin, no!
No!
There's a woman in there with him. She's being weird.
[Tobin] Where are you?
Are you coming?
Kid, you're right next to us. Can you see the road?
[Tobin] No, I can't see anything!
Ah, he's right there.
Cal, wait.
Captain Cal to the rescue!
♪ Da-da-da! ♪
Kid, we're coming!
Where are you?
-[Tobin] Over here! -[Becky] Cal, wait.
-Slow down. Ugh! -[Cal] Tobin!
Was that your name, Tobin?
-[Tobin] Yes! Please hurry! -[voice recording] Emergency services.
-Please stay on the line. -[Tobin] I'm tired!
-Hello? -[Cal] Listen...
[911 operator] Kiowa County, 911.
[Cal] Okay, Tobin, listen to me.
Just sit tight. We're gonna come to you.
-Hi, uh... I'm on Route 400. -[Tobin] Help!
[Becky] I don't know the town name, but there's a kid lost in the grass.
-[Cal] Tobin! -[static crackling]
-[call disconnects] -[Becky sighs]
Fuck.
Cal?
Cal?
[Cal grunts] Fuck.
Kid!
God.
Kid! Where are you?
Kid!
Becky!
-Becky? -[Becky] I'm fine.
I lost the 911 chick. Is your phone working?
No, I left my phone in the car.
And my glasses.
-Tobin! -[Tobin] Are you coming?
Please, keep coming. I can't find you.
Kid, you sound like you're headed for Nebraska. Stay still!
I don't care how scared you are, don't move. Let us come to you.
Becky!
Becky, where the hell are you?
[Becky] I'm right here.
Cal?
Something's not right about this. I think we should head back to the road.
What about the kid and his mom?
Let's just get back together first.
I'll keep talking and you work your way back towards me, okay?
All right. Good idea.
Okay, start talking.
[Becky] What do you talk about when you're lost in a field?
[Cal] Thousands of miles of gabbing, and you can't think of anything to say?
There once was a guy named McSweeney
Who spilled some gin on his weenie
Just to be couth, he added vermouth
And slipped his girl a martini
Oh, that's charming.
[Tobin] Hey, you guys, are you looking for me? I'm scared!
Yes. Yes. Hang on.
Becky!
Becky, keep talking.
There once was a woman named Jill
Who swallowed an exploding pill
They found her vagina in North Carolina--
Aah! Stop, stop. I overshot you somehow.
[Becky] Cal, quit fucking around. This isn't funny.
Becky?
[Becky] Yeah?
You're right, there's something wrong here.
All right, let's just do this.
On the count of three, we both jump with our hands raised in the air.
Can you jump?
[Becky] Yeah, of course I can jump. What do you think?
I think you're gonna have a baby this summer, that's what I think.
Cal, stop walking away.
I didn't move!
[Becky] Yeah. Yeah, you did. You must have! You still are.
I'm not. I swear I'm not.
Okay, just... [groans]
Forget it. Let's just do this.
All right?
-Ready? -Okay.
One, two, three!
You're close.
One more time.
-All right. -One, two, three.
This is nuts! This is fucking nuts!
Becky!
Becky!
-Becky! -Over here!
Beck!
[Becky] Here!
Beck!
[Becky] Over here!
Becky!
-[coughing] -[fly buzzing]
[Becky] Cal? Are you okay? What is it?
Nothing!
I just... I just slipped.
I'm getting a little freaked out here.
What are we gonna do?
[groans] We're gonna get out of here.
We just need to keep our heads.
-What about the kid? -Forget the kid.
This is about us now.
[Cal] Becky!
[Becky] Cal!
[Cal] Becky!
[Becky] Cal?
[Cal] Beck.
[Becky] Cal.
[Cal] Beck, just stay where you are, okay? Don't move.
Save your voice.
I'm gonna come to you.
-[Cal] Becky! -[whimpers]
[Cal] Beck!
Cal?
-Beck! -Cal!
Hi, there.
You all right?
[Cal] Becky, you there?
There's a man here.
It's okay, Cal. This is Tobin's daddy.
If you wanna get out of here, come with me.
If you could get out, why are you still in?
I'm looking for my boy and my wife. They're lost in here, too.
Look, it's gonna be dark soon. We should stick together.
I understand. You don't know me from Adam.
Uh...
Ross Humbolt's the name. Real estate's the game. [chuckles]
Poughkeepsie, wife's Natalie, boy's Tobin.
[Cal] Becky, what's happening?
I'm all right, Cal.
You can find my brother?
Your brother, I'll try, yeah.
Not like walking a straight line, though. Nothing is around here.
Just follow me, but stay close.
Whatever you do, don't lose sight of me, okay?
Okay.
Hang tight, Cal. We're coming for ya.
[Cal] Becky!
[wearily] Becky!
Becky!
I'm never gonna find her.
-[Tobin] You can find things. -[gasps]
But it's easier once they're dead.
Tobin?
The field doesn't move dead things around.
Tobin...
did you lure us in here?
You can tell me.
Okay?
I won't be mad.
No.
We heard someone yelling.
A man.
He was calling for help.
That's how we got in.
That's how it works.
How long have you been in here?
I'm not sure.
Becky...
your sister...
she's gonna die soon.
How do you know she's my sister?
The rock.
The rock teaches you to hear the tall grass.
The tall grass knows everything.
Then...
you must know where she is.
Yeah?
I can find out for you.
No...
I can do better than that.
I can show you.
Do you wanna see her?
Do you wanna check on her?
Come on, follow me.
How far are you along?
Oh, uh...
-Six months. -Oh!
I remember when Natalie was pregnant.
Those were the salad days.
Enjoy it.
Enjoy your baby, because it goes fast.
Oh.
Dad not in the picture?
He wasn't ready for it.
Well, too bad for him.
Hmm.
You know...
family's everything.
If there's one thing I know for certain,
it's that simple truth.
Well, we better get going.
The sooner we get to them, the better.
Ross?
Hello?
Hello?
Cal!
Are you out there?
Cal?
Cal!
[Cal] Tobin!
Tobin, you gotta wait!
Hey, Tobin!
Just a little further.
Wait. Tobin, wait. Wait up.
-Tobin. -Here it is.
[Cal] Wait, please.
Wait for me.
Oh, my God.
Boy, that feels good.
Come on, Cal. Try it.
Becky!
[Becky] Get away from me!
-Get away from me! -Sorry, Cal.
Too late.
Becky!
Wait!
You'll never find her that way.
Becky!
Becky!
Becky!
Becky!
Um...
I'm trying to find these two.
Have you seen them?
[man on radio] ...south breezes today, we've certainly been warming up.
That is about to change as another cold front
moves in late tonight into the morning.
Ahead of that, clouds increase tonight.
Humidity level creeps up just a little bit,
and that helps to kind of set the stage for some drizzle, possibly,
across especially eastern and southeastern counties for your Tuesday.
But much cooler weather.
It's not gonna be cool.
Considering this time of year, abnormally cool.
But today was abnormally warm.
Becky?
Becky?
Becky?
Becky.
What?
-[rustling] -[gasps]
You okay?
Who are you?
Shh.
Do you hear that?
Hear what?
Everyone else.
If you don't pay attention,
they go away.
Who do?
The people who are stuck in here.
But they're not connected to us, so... doesn't matter.
We...
are connected?
Sure.
'Cause you know me.
No, I... I don't.
You don't remember?
-Look, kid, we've never met before. I'm-- -Travis.
How do you know my name?
You're looking for Becky.
You...
You know Becky?
Of course.
Wait, how's that even... Who the hell are you?
Tobin.
Tobin?
You really don't remember?
Look, do you know where she is?
You do, don't you?
Hey, you gotta tell me!
Tell me!
Where is she?
Look at me! Where is she?
I can show you.
-But... -But what?
-Are you sure you wanna see her? -Of course! Just...
Please.
Tobin.
All right.
But you gotta stay close.
There.
Becky?
Becky?
Becky!
[sobbing] Becky. No.
Becky.
Oh, Becky.
[Tobin] The field doesn't move dead things.
It makes them easier to find.
[sobbing] Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my...
Help!
Tobin?
Tobin!
[woman] Well, we don't know whose car it is...
Hello?
Don't cross the road!
-Hello! -[Ross] Tobin, keep an eye on Freddy.
Hey!
Hey! I'm stuck in here!
Help me!
Help me!
[Tobin] Hello? Is someone out there?
Tobin?
Tobin, is that you?
-Tobin, it's Travis. -[Freddy whimpers]
What, you... you don't remember me now?
Over there, Mommy. Do you hear him?
What? Where, honey?
In the grass.
He knows my name.
-Are you sure? -[Travis] Tobin?
-It's okay, Freddy. Stay. -[Travis] Help me!
-Get out! Get somebody. -We'll close when I get back next week.
Okay?
-[Freddy barking] -What?
-No. No, no, no. I'm telling you. -[Tobin] Freddy!
Don't back out of escrow.
-You're not overpaying. -Tobin! Damn it!
-Ross! -Uh, just a minute, please.
-[barking] -[Tobin] Freddy!
[Ross] Toby, stay close. Don't go in there, it's private property.
[Natalie] He went after Freddy.
[Ross] Toby!
[Natalie] Tobin!
[Ross] Toby, where are ya?
-[Natalie] Tobin! -[Tobin] Freddy!
[Ross] Toby, don't worry about Freddy. Just come back to us.
[Natalie] Tobin, where are you, honey?
[Ross] Toby!
[Tobin] Freddy!
Freddy!
Tobin!
If you're still outside the grass, don't come back in here!
[Natalie] Tobin, where are you?
[Tobin] I'm over here, Mommy.
[Ross] Tobin Humbolt, didn't you hear your mother? Come back here!
[Natalie] Honey, can you see him?
-Where is he? -[Tobin] Over here!
-[Ross] Sounds like he's in front of us. -Are you Tobin's dad?
[Ross] Yeah. Who are you? What's going on?
-Don't come in here! -[Ross] Little late for that, buddy.
[Travis] Tobin.
Where are you, Tobin?
Tobin.
Honey, I'm getting scared.
It's only a field.
That guy, though, I'm not so sure about.
Toby, don't let that man get near you, okay? Don't talk to him.
If you see him, you run.
[Tobin] I'm afraid, Daddy!
[Natalie] Did you hear that? He went right by us.
-[Ross] No, honey, no! -Tobin!
-He went the other way! -Tobin!
[Ross] Natalie!
Natalie, wait!
Natalie!
-[indistinct whispering] -[Ross] Tobin?
Natalie!
Toby!
Natalie!
Toby.
Natalie.
Okay. Okay, Rossy boy. Hold it together.
Stay positive. That's what's gonna get you out of this.
It's gonna get you out of this.
"Mind that's light sells right."
"Mind that's light sells right." Right? "The mind that's light sells right."
Right? "The mind that's light sells right. The mind that's light sells right.
The mind that..."
Mind... Fuck.
Fuck. This fucking kid. Fucking kid.
Can't listen?
You can't just fucking listen?
Maybe if your mother acted like a mother for once, kept an eye on you.
Tobin!
Natalie!
[Tobin] Help!
Help!
[Becky] Hello?
Is someone out there?
[Tobin] Help!
- I'm lost in here! -[Becky] Sounds like he's in trouble.
-I've been trying to get to the road... -[Cal sighs]
...but I can't find it!
[Cal] Okay.
We better haul him out.
[Becky] It's really hot.
[Cal] Careful. Don't slide down into that ditch.
Watch your arm. I'm gonna pull this thing off the side of the road.
[Tobin] Help me!
Help me!
Where are you?
Are you coming?
[Becky at a distance] There once was a man named McSweeney
Who spilled some gin on his weenie
Just to be couth, he added vermouth
And slipped his girl a martini
[Cal] Oh, that's charming.
[Tobin] Hey, you guys, are you looking for me? I'm scared!
[Cal] Yes. Yes. Hang on.
Becky!
Becky, keep talking.
[Becky] There once was a woman named Jill...
-Becky? -...Who swallowed an exploding pill
They found her vagina in North Carolina--
[Cal] Stop, stop. I overshot you.
[Travis] Becky?
Becky!
Cal, are you in here?
[Becky] Hello?
-[gasps] -[Becky] Is someone else out there?
Becky, it's me, Travis!
Travis?
[Travis] I'm in here!
I'm in here, too!
What?
[Becky] How... How the hell did you get here?
[Travis] I don't know, but I'm here.
Why? Why the fuck are you here?
[Travis] I...
I came looking for you.
But how did you get here before us?
[Travis] I don't know. But it doesn't matter now.
You're here. [laughs]
We're all here.
It doesn't matter.
[Tobin] Travis?
Is that you?
Tobin?
You okay?
I found Freddy.
-He's dead. -Freddy?
-Someone killed him. -Freddy?
Who's Freddy?
[Tobin] My dog.
His guts are all out.
Tobin...
are you with Freddy now?
[Tobin] Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, just stay where you are.
Okay? Don't move.
We're gonna come to you.
All right? Just...
just keep talking.
Do you hear that? Becky? Cal?
Yeah, but we already tried that.
And it didn't work.
[Travis] Well, this time, I think it might.
Follow Tobin's voice, okay?
Tobin?
Start talking!
[Tobin] Like what Becky was doing?
Yeah.
-Yeah, just like that. -Okay.
There once was a man named McSweeney
Who spilled some gin on his weenie?
Just to be couth, he...
Um...
I forgot the next part.
He put something on his weenie
Uh... And then slipped his girl a martini?
What's a martini?
It's a drink.
You're Travis?
And that's a dirty rhyme, not for kids.
-[Cal] Becky! -[Becky] Oh!
-Thank God! -Oh, God!
It's okay. It's okay.
What the fuck is going on?
The field...
it doesn't move dead things.
That doesn't make any sense.
Name one thing in here that does.
So, explain to us again how you got here.
I followed you.
You must have been right on our asses the whole way.
Oh, no, no. I came after.
After what?
After...
you didn't show up in San Diego.
We just left two days ago.
No.
No, it was longer than that. It was more like... two months.
Now, that really doesn't make any sense.
I think we have to focus on how the hell we get out.
Well, I'm not making Becky blindly walk through Wonderland anymore.
-We need some kind of plan. -Well, we can't just sit here.
-[groans] -Are you okay?
Yeah, fine.
-I think we have to get moving. -[Becky] Yeah.
No, I agree. Let's just go.
-Well, in which direction? -I don't know!
In any direction.
Why? What's the point?
The point is I don't want to stay here.
Someone is watching us.
I can feel it.
Okay.
[Travis] Tobin,
-hop on my shoulders. -Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Do you see anything other than grass?
No.
Just grass...
and more grass.
-Wait! -[Travis] What?
I think I see something.
It's a building, I think.
That church?
No, I can't tell. It's too far away.
-Okay, which way is it? -That way.
[Cal] So, you saw our car at the church and you didn't call anybody?
[Travis] No, Cal, I didn't.
You still see it?
Getting closer.
I don't suppose you, um, told anyone where you were headed, did you?
No.
Not that it'll make much difference.
Somebody'll look for us.
Your folks are worried sick.
What could they do? You ask me, I don't think anyone's coming.
You did.
Yeah, and...
everyone thought I was crazy for trying.
Yeah. It's been a while since I checked.
-[groans] -Are you okay?
[Becky] Mm-hmm.
[sighs] Fine. Just, um...
Just a kick...
I think.
Is the baby coming soon?
She's due in three months.
-She? -[Becky] Yeah.
Didn't wanna wait to find out.
Ginny is what I'm calling her.
For now, anyways, after my great aunt Virginia.
Ginny.
You don't like it?
No. No, it's...
It's cool.
Old-school.
Yeah. She's lively.
Moves around a lot.
Here.
-Whoa! -[Becky laughs]
Wow.
Lively is the word for it.
Yeah.
Hello?
[Becky over phone] Don't let Cal hurt Travis!
Don't leave him!
Just stay with him.
Or else we're gonna keep making the same mistake!
Hello? Who is this?
Hello? What's going on?
What the hell was that?
One more reason to keep moving.
[Becky] Yeah.
Becky!
Becky?
[Travis] Becky!
Beck!
Becky! Beck.
-Becky! -[Cal] Wake up!
-Move. Move! Move! -Hey!
Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
-[coughs] -Okay.
-No, no, no. -Come here.
-It's okay. -Come here.
-Daddy! -Toby! Oh, thank God.
Toby, thank God! Oh!
-The baby's moving. -Hey, you okay?
It's probably just her condition and a touch of heatstroke. That's all.
She's gonna be fine.
We all are.
You're Ross. You're... Tobin's dad.
Yeah. [chuckles]
Hey, don't worry. Your mother, she's out there.
We're gonna find her, and then we're leaving.
All of us.
You found a way out?
Yeah, I got to the road, but I wasn't gonna leave without my family.
How?
Well, it's not a straight line. I can say that much.
-Which way were you headed? -Towards that building.
-Building? -We were almost there.
Come here.
[Travis] All right, come on. Up on my shoulders, Tobin.
It's gone.
[Ross] That's the way things work around here.
But I got the golden ticket, for any takers.
Is that CCR?
Well, folk song, originally.
Let me guess. Lead singer in a band?
Four-piece, with a weekly gig at the local?
-Kinda. -Hmm.
I'm a good judge of people. You gotta be, in my field.
Field! [chuckles]
Yeah, real estate's my game.
We were on a little family vacay through the heartland.
It was going pretty well till we ran into you.
I...
tried to warn you.
I'm just giving you a hard time, that's all.
I know it's not your fault.
Fate conspired.
Isn't that always the way? [chuckles]
You know, believe it or not, before I ended up here,
before, uh, real estate was my game,
I played a mean guitar...
in a gospel band.
Yeah.
Me and my Gibson and Jesus were gonna rock the world.
But, you know, got married and had a kid, and...
Those were the days, though.
Still, nothin', but nothin' compares to this.
What the hell is it?
See for yourself.
There's carvings on it.
They look really old.
Are those native?
[Ross] Oh, I think it's a safe bet it's been here
since before the Kiowa hunted on the Osage Cuestas.
Older than the hills.
Probably was here before the glaciers came and carried the hills away.
You realize we're in the center of the contiguous United States.
Smack-dab in the middle of the continent.
Ah, hell, I'd hazard this stone...
is the center of the center.
We didn't come here for a goddamn sightseeing tour.
You were gonna show us the way out.
Oh, but darlin', I have.
You just have to look.
Is there a map on it or something?
Just put your hand on it and you'll know.
What's that supposed to mean?
Stop!
-[gasps] Nat? -Mommy!
Come here. Oh!
Been looking everywhere for you.
-Thank God you're all right. -Stay away! Stay away from us!
Whatever he told you, whatever he said to you, he's lying!
What? What are you talking about?
You know.
All I know, all I care about, is that we're finally together.
Everything's gonna be all right now, honey.
Now what is it?
-What is it, honey? -I saw...
I saw her.
She was...
She was...
She was...
She was what?
She was what? Just say it.
She wasn't...
She wasn't alive.
[sobs] I saw her on the ground some ways back.
I saw her, I'm sure.
I'm sure I saw her.
Toby...
Mommy's just a little confused right now.
Why wouldn't she be?
Days without food or water.
I am not confused.
I saw her. I saw her, and you...
You were...
[sobbing] You were gonna...
I was gonna what?
[sobs] You were gonna hurt me.
Hurt you?
-How could you even think that? -[groans]
We're all in this together.
We're like a family now.
Right, Travis? We solid?
We have to go.
We have to go.
Look, thanks for your help, mister, but, uh...
I think we're gonna go our own way now...
Do you wanna come with us?
No, just a minute. Just hear me out.
This rock,
once you touch it, you'll know.
It's like a... whoosh!
It's... It's better than anything.
It's like accepting the host.
I know that sounds like blasphemy, but it's true.
You think this is just chance?
Folks are brought into the grass for a reason.
We're all here because we've got stuff to work out.
And this rock, in its wisdom,
brought our two families together to do just that.
All it's asking for is a little faith.
Five little fingers on its face and you will be redeemed!
All your sins, all your trespasses, all your regrets will melt away
and the world will open up like a flower!
Oh, it's a beautiful thing.
You gotta trust me on this.
I think you should let her go.
Or what?
Look, you don't have the advantage here.
Is that a threat?
It's pretty simple math.
If you think I was doing the soft sell
because I was afraid of going the other way,
well, you got another think comin'.
It's better that you come to the rock on your own.
Open your heart to it, like I did.
Now, what I really wanna know...
is how did you get here?
Because the rock wouldn't let you find us unless it wanted you to.
Unless this isn't about you.
Right.
I get it.
This is about me.
Looking for the hard sell?
Yeah.
Sure, I'm game.
-[Natalie whimpers] -Travis!
-No! -[yells]
-No! -Go!
-No! -Go!
Travis! [screams]
Stop! Stop!
-Cal! Cal! -No. Come with--
Cal, help him!
-Please! -I'm no fibber.
When you touch that rock, you'll know everything I know.
Everything the grass knows, including how to leave.
Only, you won't want to.
Tobin! Run! Run!
-[grunts] -[screams]
-Mom! No! -[screaming] No!
-No! -Mommy!
-Mommy! -[screams]
-No. -[sobs]
Don't worry, son.
-It's just flesh. -[Tobin] Mommy!
-And all flesh is grass. -No!
Mommy! No!
[sobbing] Mommy! No!
-Mommy! -[gasps]
Mommy!
Go! Go! Get out!
[Ross] Save your breath, kids.
You can't run from redemption.
He's right, you know? Where are we gonna go?
Freddy!
[Travis] Come on!
[Tobin] Come on! Hurry!
[Travis] Cal!
[Cal] What are we gonna do?
He'll find us. For sure, he'll find us.
[Travis] Listen to me. First thing we have to do
is you need to take hold of my hand.
[Becky] It's okay, Tobin.
[Tobin] My daddy's right. We're grass.
We keep dying and coming back.
-Like Freddy did. -One, two...
-[cracks] -[screams]
[Cal] Here.
-[screams] -[panting] Come here.
-Come here. -[groans]
-Are you okay? -I'm fine. I'm fine.
-[Travis groaning] -Okay.
-I didn't know what to do. -Yeah, you sure didn't.
Well, we wouldn't be in this mess if it wasn't for you.
Okay, blaming each other isn't gonna solve anything.
Well, all indicators are that there's no way to solve this.
If we're just gonna go round and round in circles,
I'll feel a lot better saying what we all know.
It's not that simple.
Are you forgetting the detail that he completely abandoned you?
That he totally threw you away?
That he wanted you to abort your own baby?
[Travis] Becky...
I'm sorry. [sighs]
-I just wanted... -You just wanted to what?
Look after me?
Protect me?
I need food.
I need water. I need a place to sleep.
What I don't need is any more brotherly love.
[Travis] No. Cal's right.
I was an asshole.
And I made a mistake.
A big one.
But that's not the real reason you don't like me.
-Is it, Cal? -[sighs]
It's a good start.
No, it's a good excuse, but it's not the reason.
You didn't want me around even before there was a baby.
The truth is, there's nothing
that I could have done to make you like me,
because no one is ever gonna be good enough for your little sister.
-A high school diploma would be nice. -You know what?
I'm not quite the fuckup that you think I am!
Oh, no. No, no. You're a real rock star.
You've sacrificed everything for that ridiculous, infantile fantasy,
and now we're all suffering for it.
And you're a real hero.
Playing hubby to your little sister?
That's the next best thing to fucking her, which is what you really want, isn't it?
Guys, stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
[Ross] Open up!
Come on, this way!
[Ross] Redemption is coming!
-[groaning] -Come on.
You okay?
Come on, hurry!
-Get the door! -[Cal] Yeah.
[Travis] Okay.
He's not gonna get through that without a sledgehammer.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
What are we gonna do? We're stuck up here!
No, listen to me. When I drove here, I saw this building from the road.
[Becky] We saw it, too.
Yeah. The church, it was just on the other side.
Okay.
-Are you okay? -Mm-hmm.
Yeah, it's fine.
My God, there it is.
Spitting distance.
Only thing is, we go in that grass again and we're back to square one.
Freddy?
Fucking dog gives me the creeps.
Where'd he go?
There, on the road.
A hole.
There's a hole.
The way out? You think that's it?
Maybe. But we're not there yet--
-[thuds] -[pants]
Tobin.
Tobin, I...
Becky, we've gotta get out of here.
[Becky] Where's Travis?
He's coming.
Holes are everywhere, Calvin, my boy.
Life's full of 'em!
[Becky] Tobin, come back!
-Travis! -Beck, we have to keep moving!
[pants] We can't just leave!
I'll come back for him, but we have to get you out!
I found a way. It's... It's right there.
[Becky] Travis!
-We're so close! -Travis!
Beck, I'm your brother,
and I'm telling you right now to forget about that asshole.
Did you do something?
[sighs] Beck.
I love you.
-Get away from me. -Beck.
-No, wait. -[groans]
-Beck, wait. -No...
-Beck, please. -No...
Please, Beck. Wait.
Thought that you would lose your sister when you got out of here.
That the baby would bring her and Travis together, you'd be left out in the cold.
You're probably right on that score.
Your mistake is thinking you're ever leaving.
-I'm impressed. Yeah. -[grunting]
Of course, I was a bit of a track star back in the day.
Played some ball, too.
-[screams] -[grunts] I know.
I know. I know.
You're thinking if you had just turned left instead of right,
you could've gotten away from me.
But you did go left,
-and you turned right. -[grunts]
And you kept running and didn't turn at all.
But here,
in the garden of forking paths,
you didn't make any one choice.
You made every choice.
And they all led back to me.
[Becky] Travis?
Travis!
Becky?
Becky?
Becky?
Becky?
[Travis] Becky?
Travis?
[Travis] You okay?
I'm scared.
Travis, where are you?
What happened?
Your brother...
I think he loves you a little too much.
But this isn't his fault.
I did this.
I had my chance with you, and I threw it away.
Whatever happens...
I want you to know I...
I'm glad you didn't listen to me.
I'm glad you kept Ginny.
Becky?
There's, um...
There's something I didn't tell you.
I was gonna give her up.
I got scared.
I didn't think I was ready to be a mom.
That's why we were, um, going to San Diego.
There was a family there.
-You don't want that anymore? -[groans]
What difference does it make now?
We're gonna get out of here.
I'm gonna find a way. Our baby deserves to live.
[laughs] She's a strong one.
I feel her kicking.
I wish I could just touch your hand.
It's right here.
-[screams] -Becky?
Get away from me!
-Becky, what's going on? -[screaming]
-[screaming] -[grunting]
How funny. This is where I tussled with Natalie for the first time.
I tried to show her the way, but she just wouldn't listen.
-[yelling] -Come on.
You wanna touch the rock, darlin'?
Huh?
You wanna lay on it naked?
Wanna feel me in you?
Beneath the pinwheel stars
while the grass sings our names?
It's poetry, huh?
Blood is nice,
but tears are better for an old, thirsty rock like that.
-It has to be quick, though. -[thunder rumbling]
Don't wanna do it in front of the kid.
-[indistinct chanting] -[screams]
No! No! [screaming]
No!
Travis!
Travis!
[Becky over phone] Hello?
Listen to me.
Don't let Cal hurt Travis.
Don't leave him.
Just stay with him.
Or else we're gonna keep making the same mistakes forever.
[Becky] Hello? Who is this?
-[screams] -Hello? What's going on?
Baby... Baby...
Little baby...
[pants] Baby...
-It's okay. -Baby...
Here, here, here, here.
-No, not too fast. -[gulps]
I don't want you to get sick.
-May I have a look? My baby? -It's okay.
-I've got her. I've got her. -Baby...
She's right here.
I've got her.
Isn't she great?
Out of the oven and baked just right.
Aren't you the Mother Mary?
Wonder when the Wise Men will come.
I wonder what gifts they'll have for us.
Hmm...
[Cal] There once was a farmer from Leeds
Who swallowed a bag full of seeds
-Big bunches of grass... -Mm.
-...sprouted out of his ass... -[swallowing]
And his balls...
-grew all shaggy with weeds -Mm.
Mm. Mm.
[swallows] Mm...
Cal... [chews]
What is that?
What am I eating?
Grass.
It's just grass.
And seeds and so on.
-Mm. -[chuckles]
Cows do it all the time.
[Cal] Here's another piece.
Mm.
-It's good for you. -Mm.
It's good for your soul.
Mm.
Mm.
-[Cal] Yeah. -Mm. [swallows]
You ate it all.
Yeah.
That's a good girl.
It tastes like...
[Cal] Like what?
Like...
Like...
You?
[Travis] Becky?
Becky!
Becky?
Baby.
Baby.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Oh, please.
Please, no.
[Tobin] My daddy killed the baby.
I know he did.
I found Cal.
He killed him, too.
This is never gonna stop.
He's gonna keep killing us over...
and over...
and over again.
And it's never gonna stop.
I'm not gonna let him hurt you.
But he's watching us right now.
You out there, Ross?
Why hide?
Huh?
If you wanna finish us,
then just do it already!
I'm here!
You see?
I'm waiting!
-[Tobin] Travis! -[grunts]
No.
I don't see.
Your honey took my eye out.
But you know what?
Eyes are deceiving around here.
I'm better off without it.
Dad!
Too bad, kid. I liked ya.
Saw a seed of myself in there.
[Tobin] Dad, no!
No, Dad. No!
All I wanted...
was to help you find redemption.
-[Tobin] Stop! -[groans]
God knows you're the one who needed it the most.
Maybe next time.
Travis!
Ready for yours?
No!
Gorgeous, isn't she?
-No! -It wants you to touch it.
This field needs it.
More than the rain.
It's so easy, son.
-Redemption is so very, very easy. -[groans]
[Travis] I'm not coming back here!
And neither are you!
Travis, don't.
Don't. No. No. No!
No!
If you touch it...
you'll never leave.
Travis?
Follow me.
I'm not leaving.
But you...
you don't belong here.
And neither does Becky.
Don't let them in.
Don't let them in, Tobin.
[Tobin] Help!
[Becky] Hello?
Is someone out there?
[Tobin] Help!
I'm lost in here.
Sounds like he's really in trouble.
I've been trying to get to the road,
-but I can't find it! -[sighs]
Okay.
We better haul him out.
No! Don't go in there!
Wait! No!
Don't go in there!
Stay away from it. Stay away.
Are you okay?
[Tobin] Help!
Wasn't he just...
Didn't we hear him...
[Tobin] Help!
Don't listen to him.
Get back in the car. You have to go.
-Kid, where are your parents? -It doesn't matter. Please.
-We just have to go. Get in the car. -Okay.
-[Tobin] I can't find my way out! -What do we do?
I mean, it sure sounds like he's in trouble.
No. No! No, don't let him go in!
If he goes in, you'll go in and you'll never get out.
-Please! -Okay...
Please.
[Tobin] Are you coming?
Help me!
-Where did you get this? -Travis.
Cal, wait!
Get back here right now.
[Tobin] Hey! Don't leave!
Look.
He said he got this from Travis.
Travis?
I'll explain later, I promise.
But right now, we have to go. Please.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Hey. -[groans]
Are you okay?
[groans] We have to go.
What about the kid?
[Tobin] Can you hear me?
Where are you?
You've gotta help me get out of here!
Something's not right about this.
We need to leave.
-Please. -All right, get in.
[Tobin] Help me!
Please! Don't leave!
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
-Wait. -What? What?
Let's take him to Topeka.
Find a police station.
-That's back the way we came. -Yeah, I know.
I thought we said we were gonna go on.
I should've never left.
Are you sure?
What about that family in San Diego?
I have my own family now.

[woman] To me, being a guidance counselor, it's kind of like being a teacher of emotions.
You know, you help these kids figure out what they're feeling and...
show them how to express it in a healthy way, you know?
That was beautifully put.
Well, you know, we have been looking at more seasoned candidates, but...
I, for one, think we could use someone with a little pep in her step.
I'm so happy my lack of experience didn't dissuade you.
I actually think it's a selling point.
You know? I'm not, like, rigid.
I'm not bogged down by that whole
"this is how we've always done it" way of thinking.
Yes, this is a Catholic school,
but even religions have to adapt with the times.
Adapt how?
Well, take sex ed, right?
You can teach abstinence all you want, but kids are gonna have sex.
[chuckles] They are kids.
I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm pro-marriage.
It's one of the reasons my ex and I broke up.
I will tell you about Eric one day, and you will flip the fuck out
because that man is a liar.
Okay, well, why don't we just do a scenario here?
Let's say a student comes to you
to tell you that her boyfriend is pressuring her to get physical.
First of all, fuck that guy. You know, I would shut that down.
Yeah, I would use it as an opportunity to teach her
she doesn't need a boy to fulfill her.
She can fulfill herself.
-Spiritually. -Oh, no. Physically.
Phys--
-[whispering] Masturbating. -Well...
I mean, I'm not gonna be hands-on about it.
-Can you imagine? -Thank God.
I just want her to know she has options.
Maybe it's a shower nozzle or an owl... figurine.
My first boyfriend was a teddy bear.
God, I loved to masturbate. [chuckles]
Great. Okay, then.
Yes, I still do.
[woman 1] It doesn't sound that bad.
[woman 2] Oh, yeah, it does.
You are fucking nuts.
Who rambles on to a nun about sex?
I mean, it's like, I knew I shouldn't go there,
but in the moment I was like, I should go there.
There's the things that you say when you have the job,
and things that you say when you want the job.
I don't know what you want me to tell you.
I fucking did it. It happened.
Oh, that's classic Aunt Wesley.
You know what? Sweetie, I think it all worked out in the end.
You're too forward-thinking for that place.
They're so-so uptight.
-I need a job. -Uh-mm.
Everyone in my master's program has one.
-That girl who ate her hair for two years? -Ugh.
She has a job and a boyfriend.
- Ugh. - Sweetie,
don't compare yourself to other people. It's a loser's game.
I thought by the time I was 30,
I'd be married with, like, this dope career and a couple kids.
[woman 2] Ugh! Being married is not the answer.
Dave cheated on me,
so you never know how that's gonna go.
I'm not even going on Instagram anymore,
because I cannot see another pregnant belly
-with "nine months" written on it. -Mm.
But I'm so happy for everyone else. [chuckles]
Sorry I called you a bitch when you told me you were pregnant.
-[cat meows] -Come here, Kevin.
[sighs] Why won't you love me?
Oh, Kevin's just depressed lately.
Oh, really? Did he find out he looks like Hitler?
Kevin does not look like Hitler.
-[woman 2] He really does. -[cat meows]
No, Kevin, you can't go outside. You're an indoor cat.
I don't know what he's trying to prove.
-Hi, sweetie. -Hi.
-Welcome home. Cheese plate. -What's up ladies?
Hey, sorry about the job, Wes.
-Kaylie told me you didn't get it. -Thanks, man.
Yeah, I mean, the archaic institution of organized religion
is no place for our friend Wes here.
See? Tad gets it.
Wes, why haven't you called Tad's friend Sean yet?
-Yeah. -I got a lot of guys in the mix right now.
Some of them are ghosting me,
which means they have my undivided attention.
You know what? Why don't you just chill on the guys
until you find a job, you know? One crisis at a time.
Okay, Brooke.
Yeah, I'll just casually take a year off of dating
while my ovaries rust and grow barnacles.
Oh, Wes, there's always a silver lining.
-Even on corroded ovaries. -[wind blows]
Oh, my God. What was that?
Well, at least you don't have a job to drive to.

Wesley, doll, it's Mom.
I haven't heard from you in a few days, and you know how I worry. I start--
Hey, Wesley, this is Patty.
You babysat the boys last week,
and I noticed some of the food has been missing from my fridge.
And I don't mean to accuse you of anything,
but it's a little strange,
so I wondered if you knew--
Hey, Wes. It's Eric.
Been a while, huh? [smacks lips] Like six months.
Kinda awkward to do this on voicemail, but guess what?
I got engaged!
Crazy, right? I know.
I guess I'm the marrying kind after all.
So, I wanted to give you a heads-up. My fiancée, Lauren, went to Penn with an editor at Brides magazine.
My fiancée, Lauren, went to Penn with an editor at Brides magazine.
They did a piece on our engagement.
It's nothing. I mean, a tiny paragraph, a few pictures.
-It's on page 75 of the May issue. -Sorry.
Just letting you know so you don't stumble on it by accident.
Okay. Take care.
-Buh-bye. -[sighs] Oh, fuck.
What? Ew!
Piggyback ride? Gross.
"Thought I wasn't meant for marriage,
but I guess it was a matter of meeting the right person." Oh.
"Whirlwind courtship included travel..."
I love to travel. You never fucking traveled with me.
My God, she's European?
Okay. [breathes deeply]
-Hello? -Hey, Sean? Uh, this is...
-Wesley, Tad's friend. -Uh, who?
Sorry, I thought he maybe mentioned to you that I'd be calling.
Oh, right, right... Yeah. You're the magician.
No, I was the one that Tad thought you might hit it off with.
Know what? We don't need to do this.
I think Tad was just throwing crap at a wall.
Nah, I was just messing with you.
-Most blind dates are crap, though. -[chuckles] Exactly.
I always feel like, on a blind date, you should have an automatic out.
You show up, say hi, no chemistry? Just say no. Over.
I'm talking to you right now, I literally don't care about you.
You could get hit by a bus, could care less.
[chuckles] I know. Exactly.
But look, um, I'm just walking out of a movie right now.
-Okay. -Do you live near Echo Park?
Maybe we could meet for a drink or...
That sounds great.
-Thank you so much. -Good night, miss.
Good night.
-Are you Sean? -No, I'm not.
-Wesley? -Sean?
-Yes. -Oh, thank God. [chuckles]
Thought you were that short dude over there. He's adorable,
but our kids would be so short. [chuckles]
-Help me. -[chuckles]
-Yes. Exactly. -[chuckles]
-Hi. -Oh, hi. I took a chance you like white.
Oh, Ordering for the lady. Strong open.
-Yeah. -Um...
-So, how do you know Tad? -"How do I know Tad?"
Let's see. I dated a girl in college that he worked with.
-Jessie Harris? -Yeah, I know Jessie.
-Okay. -Wonder why she didn't try to set us up.
That's weird. Yeah, usually,
when girls get married,
they try to yard-sale their reject pile.
"Reject pile."
Ooh, I wish that hot husband of hers was in the reject pile.
Have you seen their perfect baby?
I love weddings. Were you at their wedding?
You know what?
No.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Were you not invited?
-That was rude of me. [chuckles] -No, I mean...
What I mean is... no.
I'm using my automatic out.
I'm sorry, what?
"Automatic out," what we spoke about.
If I wanna leave, if you wanna leave, no harm, no foul?
-I'm using that right now. -Okay, we were riffing.
We were having a fun time. Have you never been on a date?
I mean, come on, now. You were dropping "marriage," "kids," "wedding"
I mean, come on, now. You were dropping "marriage," "kids," "wedding" in five seconds flat.
Not with us!
What are you doing?
We were just talking.
Wesley, you seem like a great girl.
I'm just...
-The timing's not right for me. -Guess what?
The timing isn't great for me either, Sean.
Wanna know why?
'Cause I've had a year from hell, all right?
'Cause I've had a year from hell, all right? I've had 17 shitty job interviews.
Twice as many bad dates.
Okay, my car was destroyed,
I'm on a budget, so I steal food from the kid I babysit,
and all of my birds died this year.
And my hair is falling out of my head 'cause I blow it out five times a week,
and despite my best efforts, I'm still treading water,
and despite my best efforts, I'm still treading water, sitting here on dates with dudes like you,
wondering what my life is gonna be like.
-Unbelievable. [scoffs] -Excuse me.
-Baby... -Come on. [screams]
[echoing] Ma'am. Do you hear me, ma'am?
Ma'am, I'm an LA City reserve firefighter,
I was walking by when you fell.
Cool. Thanks, man. I--
Ma'am, you're gonna be okay, okay? Don't freak out.
I feel fine.
Hey, there. You okay?
Oh, my God. Who are you?
I'm Jared Sterling.
I saw your purse go flying into oncoming traffic.
I thought you might need some help.
Wesley Darya of Belmont Avenue, who wears contacts
Wesley Darya of Belmont Avenue, who wears contacts and somehow got a nice picture on their license.
Oh, my God. Shut up. [chuckles]
You okay? You wanna get up? All right.
Well, time to go to the hospital. I'm down to take you in my Jetta.
I'm fine. I'll have my friends look out for me.
Yeah. Oh, okay.
You know what? I...
I live just around the corner. If you wanna come over,
you can call some friends to come pick you up.
-I do. -I honestly barely ever kill people.
You're so funny. [chuckles]
Great. Still not answering, but I can go home.
You don't need to babysit me.
Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I just got back from China.
I'd be up all night. You're doing me a favor.
Okay. [chuckles]
Aw, cute kid.
Oh, yeah. That's my nephew.
-Hope my own turn out half as great. -Hmm.
-Yours in the future? -Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-So, your name's Wesley. -Uh-mm.
Beautiful eyes.
-Organ donor. -Please don't harvest my kidneys.
I didn't mean to look at your organs when I said that. It was just natural.
Uh, no. I'm a sports agent.
Okay? We only feed on people's careers.
I don't know anything about agents,
so, I... guess I don't have an opinion.
My brain's not really working right now, sorry. [chuckles]
I love that.
Now I know what my problem is.
I've been being too...
myself.
Yeah. I discovered the secret to men.
Don't speak. Look, I'm just facing the facts.
-My personality is an acquired taste. -Hmm.
I love the way your personality tastes.
I think this is meant to be.
This is exactly like the book I'm reading right now for my pregnancy journey.
I'm reading right now for my pregnancy journey.
It's written by a Mexican shaman named Ángel de la Paz,
-angel of peace. -Really?
Another shaman?
You might as well be flushing all of your money down the toilet.
How much did you spend on the last one?
Eleven thousand four hundred and eighty dollars.
-Right? -That's a lot of money.
Listen, the book says
the universe throws a bunch of darkness your way
that you have to suffer through in order to find your true path
so that you can appreciate the good things when they come.
Like Jared.
Thank God. I'm just so relieved. -I was starting to think I was cursed. -You always think you're cursed.
-I was starting to think I was cursed. -You always think you're cursed.
What do you actually know about this guy?
He wants kids. He owns a duvet cover.
He liked me with a slight concussion.
-What more do I want? -What does he know about you?
He knows that I'm pretty fucking sexy when I'm not talking so much.
Okay, so you're gonna start off a relationship
by pretending to be a completely different person?
Yeah.
[Wesley] It's a doughnut-wrapped hot dog.
I have heard so much about this thing.
Two of my least favorite things. [chuckles]
Totally. Yeah. [chuckles]
Man, am I happy you said that.
You are so cute. Can we get this out of here, please?
-Couple salads? -Just a bowl of lettuce.
-Go, Wes! Go! -[whistle blows] Go!
[scoffs] This bubble suit smells like plastic and fresh sperm.
-Oh, hey, Jared! -Hey!
I'm so excited you like bubble soccer.
-My ex hated this stuff. -I'm open!
-She's crazy. This is the best. -[thuds]
-Oh, my God! My body! -Oh, look out!
Oh, my God. I love your laugh, by the way. [chuckles]
I wanted-- I have to tell you something,
and I just-- I hope it's not a big deal, okay?
-Oh, my God. What's up? -So...
you know that girl I told you about? Lucy?
-Mm-hmm. Your ex, yeah. -Yes.
Um, we were kind of engaged for a bit.
We had to call off the wedding last year. She was pretty nuts.
She smashed the windows on my car
and had my mail forwarded to a PO box so she could keep tabs on me.
And I actually came home to find her wearing my clothes,
in my bed, so I had to get the locks changed.
A psychopath.
-Yeah. Luckily, diagnosed now. -Mm.
Thanks for telling me. Sorry it didn't work out.
And that's it? No...
no other follow-up questions? No interrogation? [chuckles]
People make mistakes, you know? Let's keep the past in the past.
I think you may be the perfect girl.
Wait. I'm not rushing things, am I?
No. What? No. Go faster. Harder.
Wesley Darya,
[echoing] will you marry me?
Yes.
Oh, my God. I'm finally happy. [chuckles]
-Oh, my God. We have a pool! -What?
Nothing. Just had a tickle in my throat. Come here.
Oh, my God. Mom, you are tripping out.
-I'll make the payment. Yes. -I'm tripping? You're still gambling.
I don't have a problem with online gambling anymore.
I told you I took care of that.
How are you even paying your bills?
-I wonder, do you have health insurance-- -Hold on.
- [sighs] -Now you need a new car.
-Wasn't him. -You sound like
you're about to be homeless.
[Breathe Again] ♪ If I never feel you in my arms again ♪
♪ If I never feel your tender kiss again ♪
♪ If I never hear "I love you"  now and then ♪
♪ Will I never make love to you once again? ♪ ♪ Please understand ♪
-Do you wanna know what sucks? -Yes.
Jared's rejecting me, and he doesn't even know me.
There's still a chance he's dead.
You guys are the best.
[sighs] You're the best.
-You guys are the best. -Sweetie, you're the best.
-What? -It's not Jared. It's my mom.
Mom. Fucking stop blowing my line up, man.
You know what? I really think I need to lay down the law.
-Yes. -I need to talk my shit to him.
-Yes. -You know what I'm gonna do?
-What? -I'm gonna do a e-mail.
-Do an e-mail. -Yeah, do an e-mail.
Let's do it. Let's fucking rip it up.
"In case you're wondering, I'm doing great."
Yeah, you are.
"Except for the fact that, five days ago, your penis entered my vagina,
and I haven't heard from you since.
Does this have to do with the fact that your dead dad
never gave you enough love when you were little?
Hmm? Is it the dead dad?"
Oh, my God. Is that true?
Yeah, it's so sad, right?
"May you get drunk and get a dumb unicorn tattoo."
"Suck on this, bitch."
"Here's a little treat for the woman you're going to torture next.
Your dick is bad.
It's legit thin."
Eggplant emoji...
"Please stop hashtagging all of your Instagrams '#photography.'
-Loser. -Everything on Instagram's a photograph.
Try '#thin dick.'"
You suck at Instagram. Why don't you close up shop, dick?
[shouting] Whoo! Yeah, you guys! He sucks his own little thin dick, hard.
-"There's an art to going down on a girl." - Whoo! Yes!
-"Do not start the game... -Fucking murder him.
...'would you rather?'
I would rather finish cumming.
And if your neck hurts that much, get a chiropractor."
- [sniffles] - "May your wife be barren."
-No. -No, I wouldn't go there.
"The wrath of God,
and all the goddesses and gods in the forests and in our lands.
-Fuck yeah. -May you be cursed...
-Yes. -...and may you beg for mercy...
...that you never get!"
That was awesome, Kaylie.
-Time to do this. Ready? -Yes, let's do this.
Do we need to spell-check?
-No. Fuck it. -No.
On the count of three, all right?
-One... -Yes.
-Two. -Two.
-Three. -Three.
-What's going on? -Sorry. I'm stealing Wi-Fi.
Can you get closer to the window?
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Now my mom's calling from a blocked number.
-Mom, I told you... -What's happening?
He hasn't called yet.
Mom-- Wait, I can't hear you. Hello?
Wes, is that you? It's Jared.
Can you hear me? I have a bad connection. I'm in Mexico.
[scoffs] So, what? You're, like, calling me from some beach?
No, I'm in the hospital.
Um... I was in a bit of a car accident. Broke my foot,
bruised a lung,
-and fractured a couple of vertebrae. -What?
Yeah, they had me in a medically-induced coma.
-You were in a coma? -Yeah.
-[whispering] Fuck. -I have this client, Mauricio Sanchez,
a big soccer star. Anyway, he got arrested on Saturday.
-Had to fly to Cabo to deal with it. -I'm fucked. Stop!
Oh, no. I feel so awful.
No, I do.
I can't believe we haven't talked for five days.
You weren't pissed off, were you?
What? [chuckles] No, no, no.
Wes, thanks for being so cool about me not calling.
-[whispering] Fuckers. -Most girls would've freaked out.
You know me. It takes a lot to get me worked up. Pfft.
Yeah, I know. That's what I love about you.
You're so reasonable.
Might be the last normal girl left in LA. [groans]
-Can I call you back, Jar? -What? No.
No. My phone's at the casita, back at the Las Playas resort.
-They won't let me have my work stuff. -Oh, my God.
They just want me to rest.
I'll call you when I know more, all right? I miss you.
I miss you too. God.
-[singing] Success tastes good. -Success tastes good.
-Success tastes sweet. -Don't send it. He was
-in a coma! -The e-mail sent!
[pants] Wait, what did you say?
Jared was in a coma?
Yes, since Tuesday, in Mexico.
Wh-What was the thing you said right before that?
Hmm. [gulps] No, I didn't say anything.
-What did she say? -We sent the e-mail.
-What? -[sighs]
Well, that's what you told us to do.
-No. -Oh, my God.
-[shuddering] Oh, my God. -I'm gonna pass away.
Just... I'm gonna just... pass away.
-Now, let me go. I'm dead. -No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, I have an idea.
We'll just send him another e-mail. Subject line: "Do not read the last e-mail."
Subject line: "Do not read the last e-mail."
No! What's wrong with you? Don't do that.
If I got an e-mail saying, "Don't read the last e-mail,"
that's the first thing I'd do.
[sighs] Fuck, you're right. I'm sorry. I'm drunk.
We need to get out of this. Where's the computer?
Give me the computer.
-Give it to me. [breathes deeply] -Okay. It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay. Just write him something really sweet.
"My tender heart.
My angel whisperer."
Are you naming Care Bears?
[gasps] Maybe he got amnesia in his coma and he forgot his password.
Mm, His password. Do you know his password?
No, I don't know his password. We've been dating a month.
I knew Dave's by day five. I wouldn't blow him until he told me.
There's gotta be something. Ugh. Think.
-What are we gonna do? -What the hell are we gonna do?
There's gotta be something we could do.
-Just tell him you are possessed. -'Cause that makes him wanna date me.
-Tell him you love thin dicks. -But I don't.
"I have a drinking problem."
None of these things are gonna make him want to continue dating me.
I... Oh, my God. I don't know. I don't know what to do.
I mean, the only thing you could do is just go delete the e-mail
I mean, the only thing you could do is just go delete the e-mail from all of his devices, which are God knows where.
I know where they are. In his hotel room.
A lot of good that does.
You guys...
I want you to take this really seriously.
Would it be insane if I went to Mexico and erased the e-mail?
-Yes. -No.
Kaylie.
You guys, it could be a fun girls' trip. We could all go.
Just the three of us. How fun will that be?
We haven't done that in so long.
-Oh, no. I'm not going to Mexico. -To Mexico?
-I can't leave the country right now. -You could have a revenge affair.
Think of how fun that'll be. You deserve it.
You guys, if I go alone, it's stalking. If you're there...
it's still stalking, but it's also a fun vacation...
-after this. -Oh, my God.
-I mean, Ángel has a retreat near Cabo. -Yes.
-Maybe I could go to do that. -Great. Hit that up.
-Okay. -Perfect. Good reasons are piling up.
-This is great. -Yeah.
I think that you guys are gonna have the best time in Mexico.
And I am not going anywhere with either of you--
We're going to Mexico. because this plan is absolutely insane. And...
No, no, no, no, no. don't give me those puppy-dog eyes
that you do. I hate that when you do that.
And don't give me that weird little cat-like grin on your face.
Come on, guys. It's one hour of burglary and two days by the pool. [chuckles]
Okay? This is all I have.
If Jared reads that e-mail, my life is over--
Wesley, stop. Please, just stop.
Okay, this pitch is fricking horrible,
but I...
love you, and I do wanna see you happy.
I love you too. Come on.
[sighs] I can't believe that I'm gonna say this,
but let's go break into some dude's room.
My God. That's so...
Ramon will show you to your casita.
Enjoy your stay, señora Darya.
Uh, before we go up, could you show me which casita
Jared Sterling is in?
Yeah. Allow me to connect you.
Oh, he's actually not there right now.
Ah. Perfect. Then, I will take a message.
I was hoping I could just slip a little note under his door.
It's actually against hotel policy to give out room numbers.
You understand.
Uh, sir. I've got the bag-- Hold on--
-[yelps] Oh, my God. -[gasps]
Oh, boy.
Whoa, Mom. This is neat.
-He's touching it. -[gasps]
Why is it shaking so much?
-It feels kinda weird. -Nolan,
-put that down now. -But it looks funny.
-What kind of toy is this? -Ugh.
-Can't use that again. -Drop it.
When Mommy says, "Drop it," we drop it.
Hey, buddy. That's actually my...
little toy. [chuckles]
For a second there, I thought my 12-year-old owned a sex toy.
No, it's my dildo.
What is going on here? Is this a sex resort?
-[scoffs] No, this is not-- -What?
That was not in the brochure!
Actually, teaching your child about self-love
is a really beautiful gift.
Oh, really?
I think a beautiful gift is a beautiful vacation,
and it's now basically ruined.
-I feel like you're mad. -Nolan, let's go.
-Why, Mom? -Come.
-She seemed nice. -Poor kid.
-God damn it. -Wow, she came in strong.
You have complicated things. May we go to our room?
-Let's get a drink. -Thank you.
Gracias. Okay.
Gracias.
-This is nice. -Oh, wow.
I hope this minibar's a megabar.
Hey, "automatic out" girl.
Come on. What's up?
What are you doing here in, uh, Cabo?
Snowboarding.
That's a weird coincidence. I'm doing the exact same thing.
Yeah, it's totally crazy for two people from LA
Yeah, it's totally crazy for two people from LA to be in Cabo at the same time.
-Same time. -Has it ever happened before?
Probably not. [chuckles] I know. That's why it's so weird.
You think I followed you here like a lunatic
'cause I'm obsessed with you?
No.
I followed someone else here...
like a lunatic 'cause I'm so obsessed with him.
-Oh. You have a new boyfriend? -Mm-hmm.
That's-- Congratulations. That's a-- I mean, you work fast, but--
That's what happens when you give someone more than ten seconds at a bar.
-Listen. I've been meaning to call you. -Oh, why?
I feel bad about what happened. That's all.
-Hola, Sean! -Hola.
What?
Oh, you met Q?
-Q? -How could I forget?
Yes, we did.
Oh, good, good, good. Yeah, we went to Cornell together.
-Yeah, he was in the hotel-- -You know what, Sean?
-No. -No?
No.
No, you haven't met Q? Or, you--
-Just... no. -It's automatic out.
I deserve that.
-Yeah. This is awesome. -God.
-There are five restaurants here. -[sighs]
-That was Sean. -[gasps]
-What? -Yeah.
What's he doing here?
-That's so random. -I know.
-Isn't that crazy? -Yeah.
All right. Now...
do we think Jared would have requested a view of the beach or the golf course?
What kind of sociopath would request a view of the golf course?
Please tell me you have a plan to find Jared's room.
Brooke. [scoffs]
-She doesn't have a plan. -She never has a plan.
-Okay. -Okay.
-So, we just keep dialing Jared's phone... -Yeah.
-...until we hear it ringing? -Exactly.
This plan sucks my dick.
There's literally 100 casitas.
-We're gonna be at this for days. -Honey, we gotta stay positive.
Okay, wait. Do you guys hear it ringing?
-No. -This is so annoying.
All I hear is the dumb ocean.
Wait. I think I hear something.
Oh, my God. That's his ringtone.
Hold up. We flew here for a guy who downloads ringtones?
Oh, [chuckles] my God. He's being ironic, I assume.
This is awesome. It only took... 197 international roaming phone calls
This is awesome. It only took... 197 international roaming phone calls to find him. Come on.
[sighs] What do we do? Like, google breaking and entering? I don't know.
Like, google breaking and entering? I don't know.
- [grunts] -Fuck.
-[sighs] Shit. -Okay.
On a scale of one to ten, how desperate are you
On a scale of one to ten, how desperate are you to break into this room?
-I think that's a hard ten. -That could be a 12.
All right. How do I look?
-Okay, take the tray... very good. -Let's see.
-Okay, take the tray... very good. -Let's see. I really wanna believe you here, and I'm not.
-[sighs] I know. Okay. -I feel like she should be, like,
extra desperate right now.
Extra, like, committed to getting in that room.
I wanna feel that.
-When I see you, I wanna go, "Bam!" -Apologize.
-[sobbing] Oh, I'm so sorry. -But do not say you're sorry.
[sobs] It's me again.
But also be, like, sexy.
That's hot.
[gasps] What if she were wet? Like,
"Oh, I just got out of the shower, and the door locked behind me."
How would I get wet?
-Yeah, like that. -Yeah. I can see it.
I'm feeling it better now. We'll leave your clothes by this tree,
and then you're gonna come to the bar when you're done.
-Okay? -Okay.
-We love you. -[chuckles] I love you.
-Energy! Commitment! Sexy! -Sell it.
-Yes, and... -I'm gonna try really hard.
-Yes, and... -I'm gonna try really hard. -[phone dialing] -You look hot.
-Hola. Las Playas-- -Hi, yes. There seems to be a woman
who is locked out of her casita, number 34.
-Help me! -Yeah, she needs to be let in ASAP.
-Of course. We'll be there right away. -Okay, great. Thank you. Bye.
She must really like this guy.
[clicks tongue] I remember those days.
Thank you.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
-Welcome to Brookie's revenge affair. -Oh, no. I just want to get drunk.
Mm, hmm, hmm. The night is alive.
All right, what are we gonna do?
This.
No, I think we're gonna go over to that table.
Oh, no, I'm just not in a place to go talk to dudes right now.
Well, you gotta get out of your head and get into your body.
Yeah, well, my body is telling me to stay right here.
-So... -Come over.
Well, I'm bringing your body this way,
-and you're gonna have some sex. -No. Kaylie, don't--
Oh, God, yeah. [sighs]
[gasps] Hola. Thank you. Thank you for coming.
So sorry to bother you, but I was putting my tray down,
and the door slammed shut.  [imitates door]
Señora Darya. This is not your casita.
You're right, it is not my casita.
No, this is the casita of this random man that I was love-making with
who went to get ice...
to ice his body...
because the sex we were having was so hard.
But I-I-I can't broke the rules.
-[laughs] Por favor, Ramon. -No. No this.
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Si, si, si..
Come on.
Please, please, please, please, please.
I'm begging you. I'm begging you.
-Ramon, please. -Okay.
-Okay, I do it. But don't cry, please. -Yes! I love you!
-Don't cry. Be quiet. -I'm not gonna cry.
-Be quiet. -Thank you. [chuckles]
-Okay. -Okay.
Come in.
Thank you so much, Ramon. Thank you. [kisses]
-Yeah, okay, okay, okay... -Thank you.
-Bye. -Bye.
Thank you. Bye.
Oh, yes. Yes. Okay.
Oh, yes.
What?
-Wow, you're here? -What are you doing here?
This is my room.
No, this is my boyfriend's room.
You know it is.
Though I'm very flattered, this is not anything.
Okay.
Wait.
-Shit. I'm supposed to be in that room. -You don't have to pretend, Miss Wesley.
I know why you're here.
What?
I googled your pink penis toy.
It's called a vibrator, and it's for girls who are lonely.
What the hell are you talking about? Just get out--[gasps]
Whoa! You know what?
I completely respect you, and, look, my eyes are completely closed,
I'm just gonna give this to you without any lawsuit.
[gasps] Oh, my-- oh, my God.
-What the fuck is going on here? -[yells] Wait!
Schmoops! Are you okay? Eye contact!
[sniffs deeply] I'm amazing. Yeah.
What's it like to be in sales?
Ugh. God, it is the worst.
We're just in all-day workshops about how to market boner pills.
Do they really call them "boner pills"?
Technically, the name is "Bonalis," the brand name. [chuckles]
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Why does the world need more boner pills?
Am I right? [chuckles]
I mean, can't we just invent a drug that keeps a guy's dick in his pants?
-Can you do that? -I'll work on it.
Thank you. Oh, what about--?
Could you actually make a good dick GPS?
So that way, when a dick is going in another woman,
it sets off this little switch that just fries his pecker right off.
Oh. -That sounds like a human rights crime. -Right?
-Seems harsh. [chuckles] -That's pretty funny.
-Thank you. -I mean, maybe not the best joke...
to make when you wanna pick me up or anything, but-- [chuckles]
Oh, I'm sorry.
You thought that I was trying to pick you up?
-I'm sorry, what else are we doing here? -I'm sorry.
It's just, you're wearing man-sandals and like five million bracelets.
I told you just to pick one bracelet.
I can't pick just one bracelet. They're all fucking cool.
Should've picked one.
I was kinda getting the vibe that you may be DTF when we sat down.
But you also seem to have, like, a darkness and a sadness about you,
and it's, like, a real turnoff.
I feel like I was a bit misled.
I already took a Bonalis, so... [chuckles]
I'm... gonna have to nurse this boner here pretty soon.
Oh, really? What hand are you gonna use?
The one with all the bracelets all over it?
Well, what are you gonna do? You gonna... finger yourself in that pantsuit?
-I mean, come on. -Jesus.
Yeah, I'm gonna jack off with these bracelets.
And I guess I'm gonna have to take it to the pool
because I don't have a chest to jizz on tonight.
-All right, I'm out. -Right.
Said my piece.
Time to jerk.
-Oh, my God. -Oh my--
-Oh, my God. -What?
That's a really small plate.
It's the biggest plate they have!
I'm so sorry about that.
He's going through a custody battle right now--
Well, he technically gave up his kids.
Listen, I love you.
-I love you too. -I'm gonna put you in my pocket
and take you back to Cleveland with me.
-Please. -Find me at the resort, okay?
-I'm going to. -Bye.
-Okay. -Oh, I found a friend.
Congratulations.
Oh, God.
No.
Shit.
Sweetie, you're not very good at revenge affairs,
but that guy was a fucking asshole.
Thank you.
Yeah, I don't wanna just, like, have sex with anybody, okay?
I mean, I haven't even...
broken the seal in like a year.
Whoa, you haven't had sex in a year?
What am I supposed to do, Kaylie?
I mean, do I divorce Dave?
Or do I forgive him?
Is murder on the table?
[chuckles] No, you should come see Ángel de la Paz with me.
-Oh, no, no,no. -Five minutes,
you'll get clarity, I'll get a baby.
Wait, they give you a baby in five minutes?
Yes. It's a very quick gestation period.
Hey, you guys.
I'll explain it in the room. Go.
-Go. Get up. -What is happening?
-Go, get up! Go. -Okay.
-Come on. -Freeze!
You come into my casita and put your hands on my child?
-What are you? A pedophile? -Whoa! I am not a pedophile.
This is what you do? You go to second base with children?
Didn't mean for him to touch my boob.
You think I wanted that?
I'm not interested in your kid.
I understand Nolan is very desirable and he has a very bright future.
I'm not attracted to your child. No offense, but I'm really not.
Mom, she didn't do it. Both of us felt love.
Shut up. You're making it worse.
Stay away, whorebag,
or I will pop you like a balloon.
Come on. Let's get you a quesadilla.
Get your life together.
-Oh, God. Wesley? -Whore-shaming is not cool.
Where are your clothes?
There's-- What're you looking at?
Yoo-hoo!
Good morning!
Wow. Volume.
Somebody's not in a real vacationy mood, it seems.
Someone flashed 50 guests butt naked,
is now an accused pedophile, and also, Jared will hate me if he gets this e-mail.
We've been doing recon all morning,
and we figured out a way to get into Jared's room. Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God. How?
Twice a week, Quintano takes the guests paddleboarding,
and when he goes in, he leaves all of his shit on the shore.
So...
Oh, so we just have to grab the master key from his clothes while he's in the ocean.
All right, Q. Let's dance.
-Hola. -Hola.
-Habla anglés? -Paddleboard?
Ain't that cute? Saving me a seat.
Why are you here? No one invited you to sit down.
Well, I missed my van this morning.
And so, I couldn't drag myself out of bed.
And now, I get to see you.
What are you here for? What do you want? How can I get rid of you quicker?
I'm here to go paddleboarding, with you, actually.
-Oh, I'm not going. -[whistles]
-Are you ready? -Oh! That's us. Come on, let's go.
-Hmm? No. -Yeah.
-No. [chuckles] -What do you mean?
I'll hang back while my friends go in. The two of them. You're not my friend.
-Hi, Kaylie and I can't go paddleboarding. -Hey.
Why?
They dinged me for my asthma. [sighs]
And I checked the box that said I may be pregnant.
I wanted to feel what it was like. Sorry.
-Why would you do that? -Sean!
Señoras, may I zinc on your face?
-What? -You wanna zinc on my face?
How many times I gotta tell you, Ramon?
Not on my face. On my back, maybe. I'll see y'all in the water.
-He's fun. -Actually, right here,
Wesley loves it when people zinc all over her face.
You're not funny.
-It's kinda true. -You're not funny.
-It's a little funny. -No-- Oh, Ramon, it's okay. No.
Thank you, thank you.
Kidding. She's kidding around, joking. Muy loco.
Okay. Bye.
Thank you. No one will be going in the water.
Oh, no. Actually, we have to.
Quintano said that if none of us go paddleboarding,
he's gotta drive us back.
I think he's pissed that we took up all the spots.
Yeah, come on, Wesley, we just gotta steal Quintano's keys.
-Okay, please don't scream that, Kaylie. -[shushes]
-I am getting too emotionally involved. -Kaylie, you're--
-I'm not happy right now. -You got this. Let's go.
-Just want you to know that. -You're gonna be great.
-I have to hang out with Sean now. -I'm jealous.
-Awesome. -I wanted to go.
-Enjoy yourself! -I don't like this person.
-We love you! -The ocean is a gift, beauty!
I hate being wet!
What is this, tequila?
[grunts] No, it's just iced tea.
Well, well, well. Look who decided to join us.
[impact grunts] Ah. Are we on a schedule? Jesus.
[in Spanish] Guard this with your life.
Okay, no more dilly-dally. Let's go.
Sean, you're paddling too fast. Wait for me!
[chuckles] Now, you wanna hang out with Sean.
Wait, I think we're supposed to be standing on these.
You think I'm gonna stand up on this thing? Nah.
Okay, good. I'm so tired, I don't wanna stand either.
[effort grunts] I do not like exercise, but that was fun.
-Cheers. -Cheers.
-I'm actually into this dock situation. -Yeah.
-Who set this up? -Well, could be one of two things.
Ramon parachutes down from his two-bedroom brick bungalow in the sky.
Two, your imaginary boyfriend.
-He sets all this up. -My boyfriend's not imaginary.
So, he's a ghost?
Well, almost.
Ugh. You're gonna give me so much shit for this.
I sent Jared a really mean e-mail
because I thought he had ghosted me.
I didn't hear from him for a few days, and it turns out he had not ghosted me
but was in a coma... here.
So, you're here to, like, apologize or something like that, or...
Well, I came here to break into his room and delete the e-mail.
[chuckles] Oh, boy!
Right after I met you--
-Uh-oh. -Oh, my God, a dolphin.
Mm-mm. That ain't no dolphin. Baby, that's a shark.
[chuckles] That is not a shark!
-Oh, my God. Look! Hi! -[splashing]
This is so amazing! Look at how close he is to us.
Mm-mm, no. nah. See, you on your own with this one.
Aww, look at him. He's smiling at you.
Really? You know, dolphins smile no matter what.
That's the way their face is shaped.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, shit!
Oh, no.
-He's hugging me! -No, no, no!
My dog hugged my leg, too. But for a whole different reason.
Get my camera, I wanna post this! Hi!
Don't look him in his eye. They like that shit.
[grunts] What-What-What-- What was that?
-That was a hug, right? -You need a cigarette?
That was intense. [clears throat]
Where'd you go, little guy? [impact grunts]
-Oh, my God! -Oh, God.
-Are you okay? -What the hell just happened?
I thought we were playing.
Playing? Ah! Nah, y'all weren't playing.
-[pants] Was that his dick? -I'll be honest with you... yeah.
God, I feel sick!
-Oh, my God, Wes! -Hey!
-Why did he do that to me? -'Cause you're very sexy.
-Hey, are you okay? -Sweetie.
-Thank you so much. -It's okay. I'm gonna get a lifeguard.
Okay. What happened?
-His dick touched my face. -What?
His dick touched my face.
I'm sorry. No, I'm really sorry.
That must have been, like, really traumatic. I'm sorry.
It was a great distraction. Because...
-You got the master key? -Yes!
What's that smell?
Hey, changed your mind, huh?
Turn around, bracelet bitch.
-There's the darkness. -Text me later.
Guys, we need to hurry. We need to get back to Jared's room
before Quintano discovers the key is missing.
-Sluts. -What?
You guys, I really don't feel good.
Uh, I think maybe you just drank a little too much seawater.
-Yeah, I think I'll-- -Okay, sweetie? -[gasps] -[thuds]
Stand back, everyone! I learned CPR at fat camp.
Does this seem right?
[yells] Clearing her airway!
[yells] She needs more air!
-Help! -Get off me, you tiny pervert!
Help! Ayuda! These women are attacking my son!
-What did I tell you? -She had her mouth on his mouth.
We're in love, Mom.
She's my lady.
Love? No, we're not in love.
Fucking A, Mom! Why you always gotta be all up in my shit?
Nolan Ryan Phillipe, shut it!
-We had something good going. -Zip it!
-What is wrong with you? -No!
-Why would you do that? -Oh, you wanna step to me?
I had a 46-hour labor with this one, do you understand?
I had an episiotomy
that was 18 inches long.
You wanna feel pain? I'll show you--
-Oh, God. -Ugh.
-It's gross. -Okay.
It stinks so bad.
-Eighteen inches? -That's a foot and a half.
Adiós, señoras. Lovely having you.
I cannot believe I'm saying this,
but I am not attracted to children.
Since you have arrived,
you have exposed a child to a vicious sex device,
you broke into one of my rooms, you ran naked through my restaurant,
and you, you brought a dolphin to climax.
Okay, none of those were my fault. And you should not blame the victim.
If you enter this resort again, I will have you thrown in jail.
And let me assure you, your dildo will not be let in.
Okay.
Come on, guys. We've only been here one night.
Let's get our energy up and get back over there.
-What are you talking about? -We have the master key.
We gotta go back before they change the code.
-Sweetie, um, I think we need to chat. -Oh, no.
-Okay. [scoffs] -Thank you.
Um, I think we need to chat.
The energy of this place is a little scary.
It's kinda like the universe is sending us a sign.
Yes. Saying, "Get the fuck out."
Guys, we didn't come this far to only come this far.
We gotta get that bag...
and we have to delete that e-mail.
I am begging you. This is what friends do for each other.
You know? Think of all the times I've been there for you.
You are way above this emotional blackmail.
I don't think I am.
I don't wanna eat this.
Give me the key.
-No. -Brooke.
-No. -You're not the boss of the key, Brooke.
I am the key boss right now,
and the key boss is saying that you cannot go back to that hotel,
so there.
Brooke, I know how to get it from you.
Oh, bring it.
Please don't get physical.
-It's not my fault if she pees. -Just--
-I'm coming in. -Don't bring it in.
-Don't get physical. -Stop.
-Oh, Brooke. -She's gonna tinkle. Stop! Don't!
Put your hand on the bed! -[chuckles] -I told I was gonna do it.
Fuck.
Thanks for nothing, guys.
I will remember this betrayal when I pick your bridesmaids dresses.
They will be hideous...
and very expensive.
I will still look amazing in that dress.
You're gonna look like shit in this dress.
Wesley. Wes.
We've all lost our minds.
Wesley.
I wish I wasn't so ticklish.
Keep your eyes peeled for the niño molester.
Copy that.
God damn it!
She's still not answering. Maybe we should go back.
You know what?
Why don't we just let her do what she wants?
I mean, she doesn't even listen to us, anyway.
Was that the sound of a chainsaw cutting through bone?
Okay. We're out.
Come on, you got this.
Shit! Shit! Burn! Burn! Ow!
It's burning me. Ow, shit!
What's up, Wes?
Where you going?
Mrs. Wesley is back here at Las Playas.
Yes.
Oh, my God. Come on. Come on, come on, come on.
Where's his e-mail?
-Hi. Hello? -Hey, me again.
Hi. How are you?
Uh, really good, actually. The doctors are letting me out early.
No way.
How early?
Tomorrow, baby.
[incredulously] What?
Can you pick me up from the airport?
I might be on the late flight.
Señora Darya! [banging on door]
-We know you are in there. Open the door. -Sounds like people are yelling.
-You all right? -[Ramon] Señora Darya, open the door.
Definitely. The neighbors are doing construction.
What? At night? That's annoying.
Um, yeah. That's okay. I think they're almost finished.
I would love to pick you up in Los Angeles tomorrow.
Okay, I'll text you my flight details when I have them.
Señora Darya! I know you are here, señora Darya.
Oh, and, Wes...
wear something easily removable.
Oh, my God! That's so fun! I have to go.
Ramon. Ramon.
You can do this.
Holy shit! She came for me.
[Debbie] This is too much.
You better get running, 'cause I'm coming.
Ow! My balls! Ramon, I crushed my huevitos.
-Hi. -Hola.
We're just here to get our friend. We were guests here.
We just need to go through.
Q, this is crazy, bro.
She's trespassing, and she broke in to that man's room.
Listen to Sean. You got--
What are you guys doing? I'm just, I'm just in love.
So, we just need to go in for, just, you know...
-You're gonna be okay. -Wait, Kaylie!
Oh, my God. Wesley?
Hey. No. I'm just-- Dude, get your--
I told you what would happen if you came back,
-and now it's happening. -[indistinct]
Enjoy Mexican jail.
-[police siren] -Kaylie! [crying]
Hey! Get out of here! That's not cool! [impact grunts]
Oh... Fuck!
Please-- let me just-- It's a misunderstanding.
Ow! Ow! Wait, b-before you go, do you have any ibuprofen...
Señor? Please, sir!
I swear to God, when I get out, I'm gonna take this to social media.
Señor!
Oh, my God. You guys are here. Can you get me out?
Yes, that's why we are here.
That was the plan. But, know what?
Now, I don't know, 'cause at least you're contained here.
Very funny.
-Sweetie, this is disgusting. -I know.
It is. Don't touch the things.
It was the wildest shit you've seen.
-Wait, Sean's here? -Yeah. He brought us here.
-Hello. [scoffs] -What up, Suge Knight?
Wow. I like what you've done with the place.
So, got some good news. The good news is that
the hotel is dropping all the charges.
So, you, my friend, are free to go.
-[gasps] Was there a bribe? -Daddy took care of it.
And just so we're clear. In this scenario, I'm not "Daddy."
"Daddy" is Nolan.
Nolan, Nolan, Nolan.
-That little boy you've been seeing. -Yep. Yeah, the kid who...
Sidebar, I did not think that little kid was your type.
But apparently, he cares about you so damn much,
he couldn't stand to see his baby locked up.
-I'm not his baby. -That little boy loves you.
I need you to stop talking about Nolan.
-We need to talk. -Oh, thank God.
Remember you told us we should tell you if you were being unreasonable?
Look, I know this has been nuts, okay?
I can't believe I spent two days trying to break into Jared's room
when all I had to do was tell him
I don't think he should fly alone in his condition,
wait till he falls asleep on the plane, grab his devices,
scan his unconscious face to unlock them, and delete the e-mails.
-[chuckles] It's, like, so easy. -Wesley, stop.
Can you look at where you are right now. You're in a Mexican jail.
What do you want me to do? Dwell on that or rise above it?
Dwell on it. Take it in.
This is something you need to process, at the very least for our sanity.
Yeah. You are in a relationship
where you have to lie and pretend all the time.
Is that something that you really want?
Fine. I don't need you guys, okay?
I can do this by myself. Sean, help me.
-Can we talk about this for a second? -Wesley, you know what?
We love you, but we're done.
And you should be done, too.
Kaylie and I, we're gonna go,
and we're gonna have a really fantastic day in Mexico.
Can we go see Ángel?
Fuck, yeah, we can go see Ángel,
and we're gonna meditate the shit out of ourselves.
I'm getting pregnant. Bye. Sorry.
Kaylie...
seriously?
Oh, God.
This was a terrible idea.
Twenty minutes ago, you were so pumped up about this.
Well, I don't know what I was saying. I was mad.
[sighs] God. Can you please not make this about you?
Oh, I'm not making this about me. I just don't want to be here anymore.
I want the bus to pull over right now so we can get off.
-Right on cue. -Wait, what is happening?
People are getting ready. We're getting close to Ángel.
You can feel the vibrations.
What? No.
Kaylie.
This is not happening. Please make it stop. Please.
I mean, can you believe those two? It's crazy. They just left?
Yeah! I know, right?
So selfish.
Okay. What do we think? [Sean whistles]
So, what's up with this dude? What makes him so...
I dunno, worth all the trouble? You know?
I don't know. He's like the opposite of a flaky LA dude.
He has a job. He has a house. He's not friends with people who DJ.
Oh. So, it's a safe bet.
No-No-No. I'm obviously not describing him right. Um...
He's very hot.
Oh, you're done. So, he's hot and safe. That's good.
That's not it.
I mean, very first time we were together-- sorry, fucking--
he lit candles, he had, like, rose petals going.
He didn't even get imaginative.
It's called being romantic, Sean. Read any book or watch any movie.
Candles and flowers.
Wow. Sounds like a Bachelorette episode. [chuckles]
What do you know about romance, anyway?
Uh, I was married seven years.
And what happened? You "automatic-out" her?
No, she, she died.
Oh, my God.
-I'm so sorry. -I'm good.
I'm moving forward. It's been two years. I'm good.
Wait. So, you're just now starting to date again.
Please, tell me I wasn't your first date.
And my last.
-No. -Yeah. That shit's too complicated.
-Don't go there, okay? -Yeah.
You were totally right. I was in a really bad place that night.
No, this is not your fault. This is on me. You know what? I...
I was trying to get back out there, right? Maybe I moved a little bit too fast.
I forced myself to do my thing, and then...
you came along, and it just got a little bit too real for me.
-So... -Yes. Exactly.
I'm too real too much of the time.
Even my e-mail to Jared is too real.
It's too early in our story to be that real.
Uh, take it from me, Wes.
You're always later in your story than you think.
Come on.
Seriously, so sorry.
So, do you wanna, like,
hang out a little more? Maybe wait with me?
-I don't know these streets. -You don't know them?
-I don't know them, no. -Not familiar with these blocks.
I mean, you don't have to, but-- It would be-- Oh, one second.
-Hello. -Hey, it's me.
Hi, Jared.
-Is that Jarard? -I have a surprise for you.
I'm coming to take you home.
Stop it. I'm coming home today. You don't have to do that.
No, babe. I'm already here.
-Wait, you're what? -Yeah. I just landed in Cabo.
-I'm in the airport. -That's sweet.
You didn't have to--
You didn't have to come all the way to Cabo for me.
-What? -Is that him there?
-Where? -There.
Who's that?
Oh, my God! Jared.
What? Are you okay?
Oh, my God.
Jared. I am so freaking excited to be in Mexico.
Great. I guess just wait where you are. They're taking me to the airport.
What about your computer and all your stuff?
No. The manager at the hotel,
he sent all my bags over. He's a really great guy.
We gotta come back here now that I got the hookup.
Honey, you have to take it easy.
Okay? Don't even go near that computer.
No, I couldn't if I wanted to. They've got our bags in another van.
Oh, I gotta give the phone back.
I'll get there as soon as I can,
but we got a bunch of people we gotta drop off first,
-so it might be a few hours, okay? Bye. -Okay.
Sorry, just making travel arrangements with my girlfriend.
Just called me his girlfriend.
He just called me his girlfriend! Did you hear that?
-Shut up, now this is a big deal for you. -It is.
This means so much.
Now, you get to tell the kids
how Mommy stalked Daddy all the way to Mexico like a bounty hunter.
I have to ask you something. Please say yes.
Will you take me to the airport to see him? Please?
I mean, I'm already invested, so...
-to see how this-- -[gasps] Yes!
Oh, my God! [chuckles]
God, this is so good. What is in this tea?
Ah, I think that's just regular green tea.
I don't think so. I mean, it's got a spice to it.
-It's so good. -Oh, lookee here...
"Remove your inner thorn." Mm. That sounds painful.
I know, Brookie. I used to think it was bullshit too,
then I actually read the book, and it spoke to me.
[smacks lips] Oh, really? What did it say to you?
It said "Be a tree. Find your roots."
Really? It's fascinating.
Okay.
Thanks. It's delicious.
Oh, my God. It's so hot here, I wanna die.
-Look at this. Look how big this jungle-- -Hola, ladies.
Hi.
Welcome to the heart sanctuary.
-Let's go. -Since when is she a chick?
[whispers] I never said Ángel was a man.
Well, forgive me for assuming that a scam artist, hippie, sociopath wouldn't be a woman.
that a scam artist, hippie, sociopath wouldn't be a woman.
Welcome. I'm Ángel de la Paz.
Hi. I'm Brooke de Ketel One.
I'm Kaylie. [chuckles] I'm so honored to be here. Thank you.
You're so beautiful and amazing,
and I just wanna say namaste.
God bless. Shabbat shalom! Mazel tov.
Thank you. I love you.
[sighs] How can I help you two?
Oh, actually, just her.
I like my healers with an MD and access to Vicodin.
I'm sorry for my friend. I'm-I'm trying to get pregnant.
-Have you seen a fertility doctor? -Yes. Seen every doctor in LA,
and nothing has worked.
I'm sorry. This must be very painful.
Thank you. [sighs]
There's nothing I can do for you.
What? No, I'm in Mexico.
I read all the things about all the women who come visit you.
I can't help you get pregnant, but I think you'll be a great mother.
Stay open, and life will bring you someone special to mother.
Okay, you know what? I knew it. This whole thing is a joke.
Come on. You don't need this. You don't. Let's go.
Not so fast, Ketel One.
Thank you so much for helping out. You're such a buddy.
And listen, I'm here if you ever...
need to talk about your dead wife.
Wife. Your deceased spouse...
who has passed away. What do you call her?
-Rachel. -Rachel, yeah.
-Yep, that's her name. -Makes more sense.
-I'm so sorry. -No, you're all good. It's okay.
That's gotta be tough.
[chuckles] People like to skate around the subject, you know?
But, Rachel, she...
she would've appreciated your directness.
-Was she funny? -Oh, yeah.
That was our favorite thing to do, was laugh.
And honestly, that's one of the things that I miss most about her,
is having someone just give a little nudge
and say, "You see what this jackass is doing?"
Oh, my God, yes. The dinner-party glance.
-Yes. -When you both clock
something insane is happening,
and you know you get to talk about it on the drive home.
-That's my favorite. -Yeah, me too.
-Right? -Yeah.
Anyway, I-I'm here for you.
-Thank you, I appreciate that, though. -Honestly, I'm a guidance counselor.
No shit!
I am. Why are you so surprised?
-People pay you to give advice? -Yes.
-Wow. -They will when I get a job.
That's pretty cool.
Wait, why are the vans splitting up?
It's decision time, Wes.
Do we follow Jared, or do we follow Jared's stuff?
I say we follow Jared--
-Sean, his stuff is-- Go! -Okay!
Chill.
I know you're wondering if this is a good idea, and the answer is:
-"Please shut up." -Keep it up.
Oh, my God! Learn to drive! Stop!
Jesus.
-You okay? -I'm good. We're okay.
[grunts] It's like the fucking car is giving birth to me.
-Oh! -Shit. They're getting away. Come on!
Sean, push the car!
That's like 2,000 pounds. You crazy?
[sighs] You're doing nothing.
Sean, help me flip the car. Come on!
-"Flip the car"? -Yes, people can flip cars
-in moments of crisis. -This is a crisis?
-Yes, my love life is a crisis right now! -Aye-aye...
-Come on. On the count of three. -Okay! Okay, okay.
-Okay. -One, two, three.
-[effort grunts] Fuck! -Fuck.
-Fuck you, jeep! Fuck you! -Hey, chill.
Fuck you, goat!
-Yeah, that goat is a bitch, dude! -The goat's a bitch?
We have no idea where we are-- Why are you laughing?
Is this for real?
-And where the hell are we? -I don't know where we are.
-We'll figure it out. Hey. -Oh, my God.
Hey, look at me.
We're gonna be fine.
[sighs] What are we gonna do?
[sighs] We walk.
Come on.
We walk.
That goat is still looking at you, by the way.
Breathe in. Breathe out.
Feel the softness of the air as it flows through your bodily vessel.
The air is nurturing your flower, and it's opening... [breathing heavily]
Feel the flower open, Brooke.
Feel your roots going deep into the earth,
grounding you.
You can just cut the crap, right now.
Just drop the act 'cause I know you're just a Goop wannabe.
And I also think you were kind of an asshole to my very sweet, sensitive friend out there.
Well, I'm honest. Don't you fancy yourself a truth-teller?
Yeah, I guess you could say that,
but see, I don't charge people for my magical pearls of wisdom.
Your heart is sad.
Unbroken eye contact is a particular kind of torture.
But you would put a bunch of fire-- Never mind.
-For a million dollars, I would. -One million?
-Fire ants in my butt? -What?
-That's a lot of money. [chuckles] -Oh, my goodness.
Okay, this is gonna sound strange,
-very strange, but... -Okay.
...kicking it with you has kind of been the best part of my trip.
-What? -Yeah.
-We were just in a car accident. -I get it.
I get it. You definitely come with some nonsense.
Look, meaning, you got some layers.
-Oh no, that's fair. Yeah. -Right.
You see, that's why I think you'd make a great guidance counselor.
You're like a kid, kind of. Not in a bad way.
What I'm saying is, you have a very youthful soul, you know?
Wanna hear something crazy? I used to be in corporate finance.
-That's very weird. -Yeah.
[chuckles] Very weird fit.
Not for me. But eventually, I followed my passion, and...
that's not really working out either.
I don't know what to do.
Come on, now, Wes,
eventually you'll find that one place that appreciates you for you.
Yeah, if that place even exists.
[sighs] Don't worry so much, Wes.
The world will catch up to you.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, my God. Is that the van?
That van has Jared's bag in it.
He's playing in a band?
What is happening?
Ah, it's a quinceañera.
It's like a Mexican sweet 16, only she's 15.
It's a combination of the words, "quince," meaning "15,"
you understand? And "años," meaning "years."
I know what a quinceañera is, Sean.
-You know what that is? -Why's he at the quinceañera?
-He's supposed to be at the airport. -I don't know, he's hopping out of a cake.
I do not know this man.
Dude, come on. We gotta find out what the driver's doing here.
I wonder if they got tacos in there.
That's really not important right now.
It's the most important thing I can think of.
Another hot pile of horseshit.
A little background. Kaylie.
Came here from Los Angeles. My dreams were crushed today,
so I'm feeling a little tender.
I'm gonna be hosting a class by the aqueduct tomorrow morning called:
"Losers never win, you can eat shit all day,
and it's not ever gonna taste any better."
Fuck you. Fuck you.
You can just stop staring at me right now. Please stop.
Stop smiling.
You have a beautiful soul. Let it out.
-I don't know what's happening. -You're feeling your feelings, Brooke.
Our hearts are talking through my hand.
[breathes heavily] Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry. [sniffles]
I'm so sorry, I can't...
uh, stop crying, I'm sor-- I just-- I didn't sleep a lot.
You're crying because your marriage is over.
No, you just saw the indentation where my wedding ring used to be.
That doesn't mean that my marriage is over.
It is.
You know it already, but you haven't let yourself feel it.
Pain and sadness, it's uncomfortable for you.
-Yeah. -Anger feels safer.
-It does. -Beware, beautiful Brooke,
that rage fuels you now, but it will destroy you,
and it would destroy the life of your child.
-You love him so much, it's so-- -I love my son.
But you have to love yourself first.
-You have to love your inner child. -I have to love myself.
Love baby Brooke. Do you know where she is right now?
God, baby Brooke. I have to love her. Where is she?
You need to take care of her.
She wants an ice-cream cone. [chuckles]
She wants to run outside in a field of daisies. [chuckles]
And I think baby Brooke really wants to get fucked. [sighs]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Good news. I just spoke to Carlotta, the owner of the hacienda.
-It's all taken care of. -It is?
She hooked it up. So, her brother, the driver,
he's gonna take us to the airport when he's done.
-Thank you. -And in a couple of hours,
you get to be Mrs. Jared What-the-fuck.
-[clink] -Sterling. Cannot wait.
-Oh, it's okay, señor. We don't need-- -No, we're good.
-Sean, we're not guests here. -Oh, speak for yourself. [chomps]
Carlotta said to eat. In fact, your non-eating is offending her.
-Okay, fine. -You ain't gotta be that mad.
-Okay. -Take a bite.
-Oh, my God. -It's good, right?
-It's really good. What is that? -It's crickets.
-[spits] What? -Yeah.
-Crickets on the top. -Why would you let me eat that?
-The chapulines? -Oh, God. I'm gonna kill you.
Wow. You know, such a classy date.
Oh, like you were such a better date.
Well, excuse me.
Why don't you show me how it's done, Coach?
You want me to show you how to be on a date?
-I gotta get back out there. -I will train you.
-Oh, you're gonna train me? Okay. -Ah, huh.
-Wesley Darya. -Sean McGuire. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Sean.
Why are we shaking for so long?
I don't know. It's your training, Coach.
So, what do you do? I just realized I don't even know.
Oh, architect.
-Architect? Oh, my God. That's awesome. -Yeah. Thank you.
I love... buildings. [chuckles]
Me too.
So, what are you working on now?
Nothing.
Oh, just taking a break?
I guess you could say that. I...
Well, ever since Rachel died,
I have taken a leave of absence, and I just haven't gone back.
-Yeah. -Since then?
Yeah, it's been a while.
I'm so sorry.
That's gotta be really hard.
Yeah. But you know...
gotta get back out there. At least, that's what my friends say.
They're all worried about me, so that's why I'm here.
What do you think?
I think...
I think I'm doing the best I can. [chuckles]
Hey, do you wanna dance?
I am not a dancer. I should start with that.
-Okay. -But I would love to dance with you.
-Oh, here we go. -Let's go. [chuckles]
-Goodness. Okay. -Over here.
Oh, boy.
What is that? [laughing]
Come on.
Come on.
Yes, Sean!
How are you so good?
Can't believe you slept with my shaman.
Oh, my God. Everything is so clear to me now.
I'm gonna leave Dave.
-I never liked him for you. -What?
Yeah. He couldn't keep up with you, and so he resented you for it
and tried to drag you down.
But that's not what the person you're with is supposed to do.
-They're supposed to build you up. -Why did you never say anything?
Because it's your thing to discover.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm really sorry about today.
I just don't know what I'm gonna do. It's the one thing I've always wanted.
And I know you don't like hearing this, but there are other ways.
I know adoption takes forever, but...
Well, not if you wanna adopt an older kid. The foster care system can't place them.
Tad's been talking about it.
-Oh, yeah? -I just can't believe
how fucking frustrating it is.
Why does it come so easily for everyone else?
I'm just so sick of my body not working. I wanna fix it.
And what if you can't fix it?
Don't you still deserve to be happy?
Kinda feels weird talking about all this stuff without Wesley here.
Yeah, well, if Wesley were here, we wouldn't be talking about our stuff.
-God, that's sad. -But true.
Yep. It's bad.
His dad is dead. Isn't that so sad?
So, I just wanna be clear. You sent this to him?
-Yes, I sent it. -On purpose?
With my friends. Yeah, very much on purpose.
Very crazy.
-Yeah, it's very crazy. -Yeah.
-You wanna know what I would do? -Sure.
You should let him read it.
-What? No. -I'd let him read it.
-I'm not letting him read it. -Yes!
Look, he's gotta like all sides of you.
You don't wanna pop up with a little bit of crazy one day,
and then, surprise! He's out.
I know you think this guy doesn't know me very well,
but just so you know, he knows...
-he knows my essence. -Oh, he knows your essence?
Cool, cool, cool. [smacks lips] What is his favorite thing about you?
So many things.
At some point, I'm sure he said, "Know what I love about you? You're..."
He has mentioned that he...
likes that I'm the last...
normal girl in LA.
Look, Wes. You are a lot of things, but normal definitely is not one of them.
-Normal's not one of them. -No.
That's very accurate.
If you ask me, maybe you should be with someone who loves that about you.
I don't even know if I love that about me.
All right.
Oh, my God. Wait, we're here.
Look, um, e-mail me.
Call me, text me, whatever you wanna do. I wanna know how this all plays out.
Thanks for being there.
Yeah. This was fun.
I had so much fun with you.
-I had a lot of fun. -Right?
-Today was a fantastic day. -Thank you. Thank you.
[chuckles] You took me on a journey. I'm not that adventurous.
-[laughs] -I'm really not.
Well, I am a little manic, so...
I can appreciate that.
Thanks.
Okay.
-Yeah, I should go. -Um... Yeah.
Okay.
Hmm. Okay.
-Okay, bye. -Right, yeah.
Right, right, right, right...
You take it easy.
-Oh, my God. Jared! -Oh, hey.
-Hi! Are you okay? [kisses] -You made it. Hi!
Ow! I'm kidding. I'm fine.
Oh, God. You scared me. Oh, he's fine.
-Hey. -Hey.
I missed you.
Finally. Thank you. Gracias.
Thank you.
-I'll take you to the gate myself, okay? -No, I can take him to the gate.
-Please, take care of him. He's weak. -I will. He's mine.
Gracias, Pilar. Thank you, Pilar.
She's very attached to you. Let's get you to LA, huh?
-[grunts] -Are you excited?
Back to civilization...
-Back to civilization. Yes. -...and air conditioning.
And 2,000 e-mails. Actually,
do you think my phone has any charge in it?
-[groans] -No, I don't think it's charged.
-You shouldn't even be carrying stuff. -Just a little--
No, I'm fine--
-[impact grunts] Oh, my God. -I got that.
You should not be doing things
-like holding laptops. -Hey, Wes, there you are.
-Look who made it to the airport. -Hello...
ladies. [clears throat]
I just got here from Los Angeles. This is Jared.
-Hi. -Jared, these are my--
some acquaintances.
Hey, Jared.
-Jared got really hurt recently. -Yeah, this is not the usual getup.
-Oh, you're in great hands. -So sweet. She's so selfless.
-Florence Nightingale. -Yeah.
-So great to see you guys. Okay. -So nice to meet you.
-We can't wait to run into you again... -Totes. Don't wanna end up like me.
-...soon. -Literally don't remember
-those girls. -Or not soon.
-[groans] -Okay.
Why don't we get you another Percocet so you could pass out?
No, I don't wanna get too wrecked.
The doctors wouldn't prescribe it unless it was safe for you to...
-Okay, well-- -take as much as you want.
-There you go. -Thank you.
Good night.
-Got it? -[sighs]
Oh, long time no see.
-Hello. -Hi.
-Have a safe flight. -You too.
Well, they sure pop up everywhere. [chuckles]
-Hey. -Yeah?
Babe, look over there.
[whispering] That guy.
What is he doing? That's crazy.
-I don't know. It's just feet. -"It's just feet"?
He should be banned from the plane.
-Don't make a big deal out of it. -Disgusting.
Okay? [shushes]
What?
[whispering] Jared?
Jared. -Hmm. -Jared.
Sorry. Are you awake?
I-- What? Yes.
I'm really...
really worried about...
showing this to you, but I want you to know that, um...
I wrote an e-mail...
to you during those five days that you went missing
where I... just, a little bit, lost my mind...
and I just need to show you that e-mail.
Well, I don't know how you got into my phone, but--
-Yeah, I just scanned your face. -That's for...
Oh. Okay.
Have you started yet?
Oh, yeah.
-I know-- -Wow, this is just mean.
I know, I'm so sorry.
If we're gonna do this, you need to know
me at my best and at my worst,
which...
this e-mail is my worst.
-Pff. This stuff about my dad. That is-- -I'm sorry.
I know.
This was me just one night
after you had disappeared for five days, and--
-This is hurtful. -I want us to be real.
You know, like, both let our mustaches grow out.
"Our mustaches"?
I have a mustache. [chuckling] This is the thing I'm talking about.
Like, you don't know that. But you should know,
if I don't take care of it, I, too, can grow a mustache.
That's not-- The point is, the Band-Aid's been ripped off now,
and I just wanna be real with you.
The good and the bad.
We don't have to pretend. We don't have to pretend to be perfect.
You've just been pretending to be somebody else?
Don't you wanna just get to know the real me?
No.
I want that girl.
This girl's... crazy.
Jared, don't do this. Come on.
-Excuse me. -Wait.
-Miss? -What are you doing?
Is there another seat open that...
this stranger could sit in?
Maybe surrounded by a bunch of other liars?
No. You know what? Forget it. I'll--
Come on, don't embarrass me. I'll go.
I'm really sorry, okay? I'm sorry about everything.
[whispers] Kaylie? Brooke?
Kaylie.
I'm really sorry.
[over PA] Your attention, please. Baggage from flight 746
can be retrieved at carousel B.
Baggage from flight 746 can be retrieved at carousel B.
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.
This fucking trip. What a mistake.
Yeah, it sucked.
I mean, honestly, Jared has a ridiculous notion
of what women should be. I'm not like a trophy pet.
It must be so hard to feel unappreciated.
[sighs] What?
What are you-- Is that a dig?
-What are you doing right now? I'm-- -Wes...
we're just feeling a little neglected, that's all.
-Hmm. -Look, I'm sorry that I've been...
a little wrapped up in Jared.
-[snickers] -"A little"?
Did she just say "a little"?
Wes, you've been obsessed to the point of blindness.
-I know. -Wesley, I'm getting a divorce,
and Kaylie is adopting a baby.
What? When did this happen?
We were apart for six hours.
That's all the time that it took because you weren't there,
sucking up all of the energy in the room, and we had time to think.
Good for you.
You figured your shit out with superhuman speed.
I'm sorry I'm not as together as you are.
Wes, when you say things like that,
it sounds like you don't take our problems seriously.
Kay, of course I take [chuckles] them seriously.
You think your problems are worse.
They are worse.
I am failing on every level.
And you are the reason why.
You think I don't know that? [scoffs]
I live it every day, okay?
I am alone. I have no one.
-[yelling] How can you say that? -Because it's true!
You have two best friends who love you unconditionally.
We just flew to fucking Mexico
to make your world work.
How is that not enough for you?
Because it just isn't.
[groans] Oh, my God.
I can't. [sighs]
-Guys, where-- -That's it, Wesley.
-Oh, come on. -We need a break.
-Fine, I'm sorry. -We're done.
Don't leave. How am I supposed to get home?
You guys, all I have are pesos!
Wesley, hi. This is Doug Evans from Atwater Village Charter School.
Uh, my good friend, Sean McGuire, recommended you
for a guidance counselor position.
If you could please give me a call back. Thanks.
We were just a group of parents that were unhappy with
how our school was being run.
So here we are, just trying to do it better ourselves.
That is so cool that you're trying something new.
Really. Oh, I checked out the seventh-grade curriculum,
and I had some thoughts. Um...
I was just thinking-- I mean, unless I'm overstepping.
No. Not at all. That's why we hired you.
We want you here for your voice. I'm excited about your ideas.
-Thank you. -Yeah.
And it looks like you already have guests in your office.
Eden Williams.
Sent her boyfriend a topless pic, and then...
he forwarded it to the entire lacrosse team.
-Hi, Eden. -Hey.
-If you need me to, I can-- -I got this.
No. Technology mishaps are kinda my thing.
Thank you so much.
It's okay. Are you okay?
It's not a big deal.
My friends are just jealous that I have a boyfriend and they don't.
Do you wanna know something about love? It can be fucked up!
Don't tell anyone I said "fuck."
Yeah, I followed a dude to Mexico.
I got arrested and electrocuted, and I'm currently not with this person.
But your friends?
They're the ones who can help keep your head on straight.
'Cause they know you, they're looking out for you.
Trust me, boyfriends come and go,
but if you're lucky enough to have great friends,
I would hold on to that.
What about you?
Do you have that?
Hey, Brooke. It's Wes. Um...
[smacks lips] I just...
I just wanted to call you and tell you I miss you so much. And...
see how you're doing,
how you and Dave are doing.
I don't know if you've been to Kaylie's house recently,
but I'm in the area if you're around or wanna talk.
I would really love that. I--
Brooke, I have to call you back.
Kevin, come here, buddy.
Kevin.
Kevin.
Oh, my God. [sighs]
Kevin!
Kevin.
Kevin.
Kevin.
Come here.
Come on, buddy. Help me out.
Hey, Kevin, these are my nice pants.
Kevin! Kevin!
Kaylie.
She's getting her baby.
Oh, my God.
Kevin, you Nazi dick!
-Sweetie, what's-- Wesley? -What in the world was that?
Kevin?
Wesley? Kevin? Let me--
-He's very violent. -Sweetie.
Sorry, I was trying to rescue your cat.
What's going on?
I know you're mad at me. And you probably don't want me here,
but if I could say something...
As I was chasing after Kevin,
I was thinking, why does this cat keep trying to escape?
You know, you're the best parents he'll ever have.
I mean, really, he has a terrible personality
and literally looks like Hitler,
and you guys feed him,
and you love him,
and you look after him. And then it dawned on me,
I'm Kevin.
What? I...
I'm flawed and I'm complicated
and maybe even a little broken,
but you guys love me without judgment.
I think I just felt like I was falling behind, and...
if only I got my dude, I'd be okay. But--
-I get that. -I get that.
I don't need a dude to be okay.
-And that has to do with the two of you. -Yeah.
And, much like Kevin, I feel like I've taken you for granted.
-Yeah. -Mm-hmm.
So, I'm sorry.
Sorry?
-Was-- Did she say, "I'm sorry"? -I couldn't hear.
I'm so sorry. I'm...
begging you to forgive me. [sighs]
And I know that was a lot.
Ma'am, you must be so lost.
Please know that Kaylie and Tad
are gonna take such good care of your baby.
Hey, Wesley, this is Noelle Grey from Coldwell Banker.
-Putting the house on the market. -Just selling the house.
I had a completely different narrative in my mind.
Oh, my--
Hi. [chuckles] How are you?
Uh, hey. Um...
-You look great. -Thanks. So do you.
-What are you doing here? -I was looking at your Instagram.
You posted where you were.
I know I'm probably not supposed to admit that,
but I'm trying to be honest and own my eccentricities.
-Right. -And I thought I would come say hi.
-Yeah, cool. -Where are your friends?
-Um, where are my friends? -Oh, my God.
This isn't a bad time, is it?
Yeah, you know, a little bit. I--
-Oh, hi. -Oh, shoot.
-What's this? Are we speed dating? -No. Um...
This is Wesley.
-Wesley-- we're old friends. -Yeah.
-And, this is Ellen, my... -Blind date.
-Yeah, that's pretty much-- -It's weird to say out loud.
-Yeah, someone set us up. -Oh, my gosh.
That's so awesome.
-Awesome. -She was like, "I know this nice guy."
And I was like, "Okay. I'm not doing anything [chuckles] on a Wednesday." So...
It's going okay. I'm talking too much. This feels weird. So--
-Do you-- You should sit down. -No, no, no.
I should call my mom.
Her basement flooded yesterday, so I should check on her.
-Oh, no. -You guys, sit.
You haven't seen each other in a long time.
I hope her mom figures that out.
Listen, I won't stay long. Um...
I owe you a big thank-you.
You recommended me for that Atwater job. Is that true?
-This is true. -Thank you. I got it.
-I know. I know. -[chuckles]
Look, it's not a big deal. People come to me
Look, it's not a big deal. People come to me asking for guidance counselor recommendations all the time.
Oh, they do?
Well, guidance counselors, drug dealers. Those two.
Thanks for recommending me for the first.
-Yes, I did. Yeah. -I will try to not get fired.
If you do, you can be a drug dealer.
-Oh, yay. -Yeah. [laughs]
[chuckles] You got options, girl.
-Oh, man. It's so good to see you. -Yeah, you too. Well...
Um, listen, I wanna say something, and I know this is weird
'cause you're very much on a date right now, but, um...
I like you.
And I know I was hung up on Jared, but that's not my guy.
And I feel like I'm myself around you.
What if we just...
What if we gave it a shot?
I like you too. I...
But?
Wes, I don't think I'm-- I don't think I'm there.
You're literally on a date right now.
This is casual.
What we had in Mexico was real.
You would be more than just a date.
You see, you deserve somebody that's gonna sweep you off your feet.
Am I able to be that person again?
I wanna say that I am, but honestly...
[smack lips] I just, I just don't know.
Okay, I'm sorry I interrupted.
-Thanks, Sean. -Wes.
Hey.
So...
basement's okay,
but my brother's missing.
I'm sorry. What? [chuckles]
Like, on a date.
-[sighs] -Wes.
Look...
I wasn't supposed to meet somebody so fast. You know? I was... just getting my feet wet.
You know? I was... just getting my feet wet.
Oh, my God. You don't need to say that. [chuckles]
I-- honestly, it's fine. I'm fine.
That's the thing, Wes. I'm not okay with just being fine.
I want more than that. I wanna be...
crashed out on the side of the road,
yelling at a bitch-ass goat...
with you.
I wanna watch you dancing, you know?
Like you have nerve damage.
Wes, you are messy...
and complicated...
and so perfectly you.
And I haven't felt like this in a long time,
and I don't want it to end.
Me neither, Sean.
Wesley Darya...
will you marry me?
-What? -What?
No, I don't wanna marry you, but I would like to date you.
Why do you think I'm here? I've been thinking about you ever--
Shit.
Hey.
Yeah, no, the blind date's not going good.
