Who would name their son after some rock?
Why would anyone name their daughter after some coin?
And the least valuable one, too.
If an "S" is added at the end, it becomes a homonym, you know--
Shut up, okay?
Hey, what you fighting about?
-Nothing. -Nothing.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah.
Gorgeous.
Remarkable.
I'm nothing special.
I'm just an ordinary girl.
Hey. How ya going?
Good! How are you?
Good, thanks! The test results.
Okay. No problem.
I'll just wait for the printout.
Are you going away for the holidays?
If I flunk this, I'm going back to Singapore.
I'm sure you'll do well.
Thank you.
I'll just get the printout for you.
Okay, don't show me!
Okay, I'm sure they'll be good.
Thank you.
-Your card. -Thanks so much.
-Have a good day! -See you.
Bye.
Hello! Mummy!
I don't have to go back to Singapore! My results are excellent!
Really!
And then...
Those are my results.
I don't know what you're up to. I'm on the phone to Singapore.
But those are my results.
Mummy.
I'll call you back later.
Okay, bye-bye.
Look, I don't know what you're talking about,
I already have a boyfriend.
And these are clearly my...
Your surname is "Yang," too?
Is that a problem? My father's surname is "Yang," too.
Why didn't you speak Mandarin earlier?
White imposter.
The pot calling the kettle black.
It was love at first sight for Perry.
But... the person that I like...
is him.
That's Peter Park.
He's the son of a Korean hotel-chain magnate.
God is so unfair.
Not only is Peter ultrarich,
but he's also incredibly handsome.
I'm not sure why,
but Peter always looks like he walked out of a K-pop music video.
No matter their race or nationality,
once a girl sees him,
she's irresistibly drawn to him.
But... Peter doesn't care about anyone
but me.
Peter only likes to hang out with me.
I think...
he might be secretly in love with me, too.
So, how did you do?
All right, that's just my fantasy.
Peter and I are like brothers.
We became fast friends after we met during student orientation.
Actually...
I'm not sure
why we became buddies.
Perhaps it's because...
I'm always helping him.
For example, I attend his classes for him...
take notes for him...
and occasionally...
I do his assignments for him.
I offer him my shoulder to cry on when he's sad.
Peter is always sad.
I'm not sure why,
because he never says anything.
Besides me, no one in school has seen Peter cry.
I'm used to it by now,
but every time I see Peter cry...
I still feel sorry for him.
Now that Perry's there, he can share half my responsibilities.
Now Perry has also seen Peter cry.
Actually, Perry is just like me.
Because when he likes someone,
he'll do things that he otherwise wouldn't.
But why did Peter choose me to be his BFF?
I'm not sure.
And why do I hang out with Perry?
I'm not sure, either.
Anyway,
the three of us hung out all the time and became best friends.
Everyone calls us the "3 Peas."
Actually, white people don't know
the real meaning of "3P" in Chinese.
But the three of us don't resemble that meaning.
Actually, we have nothing in common
except that our names start with 'P.'
We all have very different personalities.
Perry's family in Taiwan isn't well-off.
He obtained a scholarship from some company
to study in Australia.
Peter doesn't care about his studies.
He's going to take over his dad's business in Korea anyway.
Me...
I'm just an average Singaporean girl.
Besides Peter, I don't have a clue what I like.
And that's how we ended up spending a good four years together.
Four years of university life flew by.
If though we never said it,
we weren't looking forward to going our separate ways.
Hey!
We're graduating soon.
Will you miss me after we go back to our respective countries?
Yes, I will...
miss you doing stuff for me.
Speak English!
Perry's just asking if you're going to miss me after graduation.
Yeah, I'll miss you doing my homework for me.
Look, I'm just kidding.
You know I don't really want to go back to Korea.
I'm dreading it, actually.
Well, at least you have a wife there waiting for you.
That's why I'm dreading it.
I remember she's pretty hot. Let's see the photo again.
Hey, stop it!
She's hot! I would do her.
You can have her, then. Can't even remember her name.
Choi Ji-woo? Jang Nara? Or Boa?
Very funny.
Yeah, stop it! What about you?
Hey!
Always looking at it.
Bet there's a lot of pretty Taiwanese girls' pictures inside.
No password?
Sorry.
What are you so secretive about, anyway?
Even though we've known you for so long, we hardly even know you.
Speak English!
I was just saying
Perry's so secretive.
We hardly even know him even though we've known him for so long.
You're right!
And that's why we need to take a trip after graduation!
A bonding trip! You know, we never go anywhere together.
We go everywhere together.
No, but this will be a road trip where
we'll be together 24/7 and really get to know each other.
Including the secretive Perry.
I don't know.
I got to go back to Taiwan straight away after graduation.
You know I'm on a scholarship, right?
I already have a job waiting for me.
I didn't do too well on my exams.
My parents probably won't think I deserve a trip.
Come on, guys!
This could be the last time we actually hang out together as the 3 Peas!
we actually hang out together as the 3 Peas!
Well, I guess I can write to them and say I will start work later.
They love me, anyway. My results are excellent.
Great! And you?
I guess I can tell them that I won it in a lucky draw.
They're Singaporeans, they'll think it's a waste not to go.
It's a waste not to go.
Well... indeed, you have won a trip!
Park, Sr. will pay for this.
Look, you know I really am not looking forward to going back.
Everything is planned for me.
My life. My work. My wife.
Let's just have some fun before I lose my freedom forever, okay?
Just grant me that.
Okay. On one condition.
I plan the trip.
You'll have to. The two of us suck at planning anyway.
Hey! I don't!
I just...
haven't really found something I want to plan for.
Yeah, right!
One thing, though.
I got to have my own room, okay?
I've never shared a room with anyone in my life.
Don't worry. I won't let you sleep with him.
I'll pay for all three rooms.
Oh, my God! What an exciting trip we're going to have!
To the 3 Peas Road Trip!
Hey, it's bad luck to toast with water.
And I have no more coffee in my cup.
Gross!
To the 3 Peas Road Trip!
Come on!
To the 3 Peas Road Trip!
Who could have guessed
what a life-changing road trip
this would turn out to be?
What are you doing?
I'm booking the rooms.
Your K-pop star wants three rooms. I have to book them before they run out.
And there's your key. Have a wonderful trip!
Thank you!
I don't like this car.
Why?
Yeah, it's hardy, practical, and very suitable for our long drive.
Yeah, but it's boring.
I want a sexy car like what we see in road-trip movies.
Do you have a Cadillac or something with an open top?
Come on, guys! It's a freaking road trip!
Look, I'm sorry, I know this is kind of last minute,
but do you have a sexy car?
Well, we do have a very beautiful car.
We call it "The Car."
But I've got to tell you, kids...
it's going to cost you twice as much as this one.
Well, let's see it.
This is a beautiful, classic
Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible in Athenian blue
with contrasting beige hide.
It's a remarkable and luxurious car for road trips.
We'll take it!
If you love taking pictures so much, why don't you get yourself a camera?
This phone can take really good pictures. I don't need a camera.
And I can store a lot of pictures on this phone.
It's portable and convenient.
You really are very thrifty.
Yeah... Speak English!
You have so many part-time jobs.
And you have a well-paying job waiting for you back in Taiwan.
Why don't you just buy yourself a proper camera?
You never know about the future.
And it's always better to save for a rainy day.
My dad would love for you to be his son.
Sure. Can he adopt me?
I'm pretty sure he'll prefer you to me as his son.
You want to marry Boa?
If I can be your dad's son, I will even marry Dae Jang-geum.
Then maybe I'll really consider buying that camera.
Hey! What about me?
You want to marry Dae Jung-geum?
-I thought you wanted to marry me! -What?
You want her to marry you,
so she can continue doing your work for you in Korea.
Well, then I think you'll have to come, too.
To help her do my work for me.
I'm not sure why,
but I often have recurring images of this moment.
Every detail remains vivid in my memories.
Perry's silly jokes,
Peter's carefree demeanor...
Whenever I recall this moment, I feel very happy.
Three university students
sitting in a Rolls-Royce Corniche Convertible...
driving along Great Ocean Road,
without a care in the world.
Whatever happens is in the future.
We are living in the now.
If I could stop time,
I'd choose to live in this moment forever.
Because I think this might be...
the happiest time of my life.
That's impossible. I remember booking three rooms.
It is a booking under Mr. Yang, right?
That's correct. I booked three single rooms.
Nope. It says here only one room, and we're fully booked today.
Look, I have the money.
Can I pay double whatever you're charging?
Hey, this is not your dad's hotel.
Yeah, well, obviously not.
If it were, we would be escorted to our suites now.
Separate suites.
Look, I'm sorry. It's obviously my mistake.
Let's just make do with this one room.
After all, we're only staying a night.
We'll take it.
Don't be so angry.
I think it's inappropriate for you to sleep in the middle.
Why not?
It's just inappropriate.
Then what do you want?
Let's switch places.
Do you think I want to switch with you?
Hey, shouldn't girls have a little modesty?
You come over here.
Perry Yang!
What?
What was that I felt?
What was what?
Oh, please.
I think you're the one that I should be wary of.
Go to sleep!
You're really scary, you know that?
Get up.
We have a lot of places to visit today. Go wash up.
Do you know that you're just like my mom?
Really? Is your mom as good-looking as me?
You're not as good-looking as he is.
I don't disagree.
Get up!
Should I be with the one who loves me...
or with the one I love?
What the heck, they didn't even say they loved me.
What are we having?
He's having two egg whites, scrambled, with toast, wholemeal,
grilled tomatoes and fruit. And a glass of milk.
She's having pancakes with maple syrup on the side,
and an English breakfast tea.
Right! What you having?
I'll just have a yogurt and a coffee. Thanks.
Okay.
Peter!
One, two, three.
Nice.
Looking good.
You're looking good.
Why aren't you joining us?
No, thanks. I'm afraid of the cold.
Don't be a spoilsport. We're already here.
Yeah, come on. We came all the way here.
-Come! -Come on! Come on.
Faster!
Come on!
All right!
Are you for real?
I never see you work out and you have such a nice body?
You really are secretive, aren't you?
I only started working out recently.
Recently, and your body looks like that?
Did it for you. Like it?
How much further? I can't walk anymore.
Come on! You can do it.
Just one more kilometer!
Doesn't feel like it!
That's because we're on a gradient and it's the altitude.
Okay.
Okay?
Hurry up, you two! Before we lose the light!
What did you have for breakfast? Why are you so heavy?
I didn't eat much! Just the usual.
You're lying!
-Why do you keep calling me fat? -You've put on weight recently.
Crazy, isn't it?
Is this what the world looked like thousands of years ago?
Well, not in Singapore.
It's a tropical country.
More rainforests and fewer terrains.
Do you think this is what heaven looks like?
Depends on your religion, I guess.
They have different forms of heaven.
If you're Christian, there must be a white light,
plus some cherub angels playing harps.
Do you know the two of you are my bestest friends?
In the face of such splendor...
I guess anyone would feel insignificant.
Okay. Penny gets the single bed.
That's obvious enough.
It's okay. I'll call the reception and ask for an extra cot or mattress.
This is a call from room 136.
Do you have an extra cot or mattress?
No?
Okay.
They've run out.
Why did we even put you in charge of booking the room?
I said three rooms!
Hey, it's just for one night.
I'm sorry. I'll take the floor.
Well, I'm the skinniest,
so I can share the bed with one of you,
the other one can take the other bed.
-No! -No!
Okay, whatever.
You're lucky we're both pretty lean.
Hey!
Switch places with me.
If I go over, don't even think about coming here.
Both of you can continue to squeeze like sardines, then.
You'd rather be uncomfortable than let me be with him.
You're so selfish.
A girl's lips are the sexiest.
Here, let me help you put on some lip balm.
-No, thanks! -Okay, forget it, then.
I'll help you style your hair.
A pretty girl should have long straight hair.
This is what I'll do to your hair.
Why do you always make fun of me?
Okay.
So, this is where we kept our wines over a hundred years ago.
These are what we call "the drives."
We have a three-kilometer labyrinth of tunnels here.
So, don't go wandering off,
or you might not find your way out again.
That's Emily. Don't worry about her.
She's all right.
In fact, she is just about to be married to
one of the richest landowners in Western Victoria,
arranged by her father.
And looks to me like she needs a bit of a bath.
Look, how long is this tour?
It's getting a little stuffy down here.
Well... We are almost done.
So, then we'll head up for some wine tasting, okay?
Come on. Yeah, follow me.
This is our barrel chapel,
where couples can hold their wedding ceremonies
in a unique, rustic and romantic ambience.
Can three people get married to each other here?
Well...
I'm not sure if that's quite allowed
or even...
recognized here in the state of Victoria,
or in Australia, or...
anywhere in the world, for that matter.
But...
we are very open here.
We've had an interracial wedding
and even a gay marriage.
But if you want to have a party for your friends
to celebrate the three of you graduating,
then that is fine with us.
Now, I think it's time for a drink!
To the Drives Café for some wine tasting.
All right, follow me.
What's wrong with you? Have you taken your meds?
By the way, it's "get married to one another" if it's more than two people.
"Each other" is only reserved for two.
Didn't your elementary English teacher teach you that in Korea?
Let's go!
Seppelt Fleur de Lys Vintage
is an elegantly refined sparkling wine
which has won 90 medals out of its last three vintages.
-Would you like to try? -No, she doesn't drink.
-Yes, she does. -I'll have it.
I think it's supposed to be called "wine tasting."
Well, I think you like that one. So, how about this one?
Our Seppelt specialty
St. Peters Grampians Shiraz.
St. Peters? I must have it, then.
Really good! I'll love to try all your wines here.
Now, what?
What do you mean?
I've never seen him so drunk before.
The last time he was that drunk was when Lisa broke up with him.
Hold on, Lisa!
You don't care about anyone but yourself!
He was never in love with Lisa.
How do you know?
Of course I know.
He doesn't like white people.
He only dated a white girl to spite his father.
Fine! Do what you want!
He got drunk the other time because his father called him.
But, Dad, I really don't want to do it
No...
But I told you the other time, didn't I?
Dad, can't you try to understand?
Dad!
Hello? Dad!
How do you know?
I know everything about you. Your everything includes his everything.
So, naturally, I know everything about him.
Okay, you get some rest. I'll take care of him.
I can take care of him, too.
You've taken care of him for long enough.
I'll take care of him tonight.
Dig in.
So, what's for breakfast?
Hey, you're up!
Yes, and very hungry!
Waitress!
You can serve the eggs now, without the yolks. Thank you.
Wait. I think I'll have some yolks this morning.
Yes, hi. Can I have two eggs sunny side up,
with yolks runny, but whites fully cooked,
with bacon, sausages and a side of baked beans. Thank you.
After all that drinking yesterday,
I think I'll need some trans fat and cholesterol to fight the hangover.
What? I'm hungry!
I got you a present.
I bought it at the store yesterday.
I want to tie you down.
Thanks.
Boy, I'm hungry. So, where are we going today?
We're going to see some fat, lazy buggers.
What's the matter with you?
What do you mean?
I have no idea what's going on, either.
Isn't this what you've always wanted?
Love...
is so complicated.
Without romance...
life would be so simple.
I wonder if seals
know anything about love.
Hey, I got this for you.
I got one for you, too.
He's never given me anything in the past four years.
But today, I received not one but two presents from him.
I have one, too.
How do you know what I'm thinking about?
How could I not know?
Talking bad about me again?
We wouldn't dare.
This is for you.
It's got orange vodka, Chambord raspberry liqueur
and cranberry juice.
It's called "the Love Potion."
And I got you a Zombie.
What did you get yourself?
Sneaky Pete. It's got milk in it, it's healthy!
Thanks for coming to see The Good China, everybody.
Hope you're having a fantastic night.
All right, tonight we've had a bit of a request.
I would like to invite up on the stage Perry,
I would like to invite up on the stage Perry, who is going to sing a love song for that special someone.
You and I
If we could be together
You and I
If there were love We would be like two stars in the sky
Giving each other strength
And creating eternal beauty In the Milky Way
There would be infinite bliss As we would be happy and free
You and I
Will continue our lives together
You and I
It doesn't even matter if there's no love
You revolve around the sun
I'm not as powerful as the sun
But I will always give you light
Even though I can only provide A bit of comfort in the night
I will continue to revolve around you
You and I We're just like the Earth and the moon
Even though we can never get closer
And I can only appear in the night
My heart will forever belong with you
You and I
If we could be together
You and I
If there were love
That was good. Never knew you were so musically inclined.
There are lots of things you don't know about me.
You never tell us.
Well, you never asked.
All right, it's never too late to ask.
Let's play Truth or Dare! How about it? Who's in?
I am!
Sure.
Sweet! We shall start with Perry, then.
Truth or dare?
Dare.
Come on.
-All right. Truth. -Sweet.
How many relationships have you had before?
None.
Are you in love with someone now?
That's two questions.
Your turn now.
-Truth or dare? -Truth.
When was the last time you were truly happy?
When I was 12, maybe.
Guys...
this is our farewell road trip!
It's a freaking holiday!
Can we just try to enjoy ourselves?
Okay.
Your turn, then. Truth or Dare?
Dare?
Truth.
Who do you love?
My mom.
Given a choice,
would you choose him or me?
Right, this is so fair.
Can I please have the chance to participate in this game?
Weren't we part of the same race 3,000 years ago?
More like 5,000, actually.
Whatever. This game is no fun. Let's just drink up!
I'm going to get another Zombie.
Perry might wake up.
Don't worry. He's had too many Zombies.
He's as dead as one now.
What's wrong?
Penny!
You've never liked me.
What?
You tell me what.
Do you even like me?
I don't even know what I like.
Or what I want.
I'm screwed up. Sorry.
Look...
if you don't like your arranged marriage with your arranged wife,
just tell your father.
If you don't want to work for him, just tell him.
What are you so afraid of?
Stop being so unhappy all the time!
You'll never understand.
You're right.
I don't.
I don't understand why you'd want to be nicer to me
just because you see Perry being nicer to me.
Do you...
really care about me?
Or is it just because you always want things that you cannot have?
But when you know that you can have them,
you just don't freaking want them anymore!
I don't understand why you're so unhappy all the time.
You have everything.
You're rich. You're smart.
You're good-looking. You have everything!
Why do you have to keep taking those pills?
Do they really make you happier?
Just... get a life!
I'm begging you!
Did I go too far?
Come on, wake up, sleepyheads! We got to go now, before it's too late!
Come on...
It's only 4:30 a.m. Where are we going?
You'll know in a minute.
But you got to hurry! You won't want to miss it!
Let's go, okay?
Come on, you two!
Nice, isn't it?
You know, I used to hate sunrises.
When I was little,
my dad used to wake me up at 5:00 a.m. during weekdays.,
just before going to school.
And drag me up the hill near our house to see the sunrise.
I would be so tired.
And that's the only time I would see him the whole day.
He said that was my bonding time with him.
He always said...
That's "seize the day" in Korean.
He's so afraid of wasting time.
Everything he does has to be productive and constructive.
He said climbing the hill was good exercise,
and we should make good use of what nature gives us,
and sunrises are free.
Your dad is a cheapskate.
What are the sunrises in your countries like?
Don't think I've ever noticed.
In Singapore...
students wake up really early in the morning.
And they're on the school bus before the sun rises.
We try to sleep in on weekends.
I live in Taipei. It's a very busy city.
There's never time to catch the sunrise.
I guess I'm lucky, then.
All right.
Carpe diem! Seize the day, guys!
Come on, let's go get some breakfast! Come on, hurry!
Did I really say the right thing to him?
What does it say?
"My dear father,
you have planned my life for 22 years.
Please stop. Screw you!"
Okay, not the "Screw you," but something along those lines.
Well, what are you waiting for? Send it!
Yeah! Nice one!
All right, let's go out for a celebration. Let's go!
Wait for me!
He forgot his mug.
He's going to have the scrambled eggs, and--
And she's going to have pancakes with maple syrup.
And a cup of English breakfast tea.
And he will have yogurt and a cup of coffee.
Peter really changed for the better.
Thank you.
He's happier now.
He used to be really self-centered.
But now, he's more caring
and sensitive towards others' feelings.
Despite how long I'd known Peter,
I'd never seen him laugh so whole-heartedly.
Perry and I are happy for him.
I guess that's what real friends are like.
Seeing our friend happy makes us happy, too.
Hey, your camera.
You can have it.
No, come on.
I have a job now, I can afford my own camera.
Well... I really won't be needing it anymore.
Please just have it, for planning the best trip of my life.
This is the last day of our four years together.
Someone's leaving us tomorrow.
Any last words for him?
Don't use the word "leave."
You should say "depart."
Then we might as well say "apart."
Yeah!
Speak English!
Perry's just asking if you're going to miss me after you go back to Korea.
No, he didn't.
You understand Chinese now?
Only when I'm drunk.
You said it's our last night together.
I don't have to understand Chinese to know that.
But what are you so sad about?
This world is so small now.
It's not like we are never going to meet each other.
I mean "one another" again.
We won't.
We'll be so busy with our working lives.
There will be no reason or motivation
to connect with one another.
Well...
Maybe in the beginning,
we'll tag one another in the pictures of our trip.
But after that,
we'll be so busy working, meeting deadlines...
getting promoted,
dating, getting married,
having children.
And before you know it...
30 years will have passed.
Penny, don't cry.
No matter how busy I get...
I promise...
to always...
poke you on Facebook.
Hey, you come here, too.
I love you both very much.
Even if we never meet again, please know that...
you two have made me very happy.
And I will always keep you two in my memories...
wherever I go,
whatever I'll be doing.
Forever.
To the 3 Peas Road Trip.
You don't say.
Peter! Peter!
Hey!
Wake up! We're going to be late!
Peter is nowhere to be found. I'll go to the bathroom.
Perry?
Do you think this is what heaven looks like?
What's wrong?
Stop being so unhappy all the time!
You'll never understand.
Let's just have some fun before I lose my freedom forever, okay?
Just grant me that.
Peter's body was found at the bottom of Prospect Hill.
According to the forensic report,
he jumped at about 6:00 in the morning...
which was right after sunrise.
I promise...
to always...
poke you on Facebook.
When did Peter make that decision?
Just... get a life!
I guess we'll never know.
It's a shame that Peter only found peace...
after he gave up on life.
Please just have it, for planning the best trip of my life.
Peter was right.
We really don't understand.
What are you waiting for? Send it!
Yeah! Nice one!
All right, let's go out for a celebration. Let's go!
We didn't understand that a life where you have everything...
and yet nothing to look forward to...
is really no life at all.
Dear Father, I'll live my life the way I want
Hey! Wait for me!
Sometimes I feel really guilty.
Other times, I'm mad at you.
But mostly...
I just miss my friend.
Hello?
Auntie...
this is Penny.
Perry is talking to Peter's parents now.
Okay.
Okay, I'll tell him.
Okay, bye-bye.
If you love taking pictures so much, why don't you get yourself a camera?
This phone can take really good pictures. I don't need a camera.
And I can store a lot of pictures on this phone.
It's portable and convenient.
Peter!
One, two, three.
Are you for real?
I only started working out recently.
Do you know my name means "rock"?
Who would name their son after some rock?
Beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah. Gorgeous.
Remarkable.
Okay. On one condition.
I plan the trip.
That's impossible. I remember booking three rooms.
What are you doing?
I'm booking the rooms.
Your K-pop star wants three rooms. I have to book them before they run out.
I think it's inappropriate for you to sleep in the middle.
You come over here.
What?
What was that I felt?
What was what?
Oh, please.
I think you're the one that I should be wary of.
This is a call from room 136.
Do you have an extra cot or mattress?
No?
Okay.
They've run out.
Excuse me.
Okay.
I know everything about you. Your everything includes his everything.
So, naturally, I know everything about him.
I bought it at the store yesterday.
I have one, too.
There are lots of things you don't know about me.
How many relationships have you had before?
None.
Are you in love with someone now?
You and I
If we could be together
You and I
If there were love We would be like two stars in the sky
Then we might as well say "apart."
-I'll just wait for the printout. -Sure.
Are you going away for the holidays?
If I flunk this, I'm going back to Singapore.
-I'm sure you'll do well. -Thank you.
I'll just get the printout for you.
Okay, don't show me!
-Okay, I'm sure they'll be good. -Thank you.
-Your card. -Thanks so much.
-Have a good day! -See you.
Bye.
Those are my results.
Look, I don't know what you're talking about.
I already have a boyfriend.
And these are clearly my...
You're really sick, you know that?
Who are you? You're the one who deserves to die.
Not Peter!
I'm sorry.
We came all the way to Singapore for this photo shoot.
We'd like to choose a few more pieces.
I've picked four pieces. Please have a look.
We need to match these jeans.
So, let's take a look at this green short-sleeved shirt.
This one?
I still lead an ordinary life.
Mostly, I keep myself busy.
But even when I'm at my busiest...
I can't help but think of those days in Australia.
Because our commercial...
I really hope that Peter is happy now.
I'm sure he's in heaven now,
playing harps with cherub angels.
He's a great body.
Hey, you don't believe me?
Allen, show her what you've got.
I sometimes wonder...
how the other Pea is doing?
Whatever it is,
I'm sure he's doing well.
No gym, no work.
You know?
That's just the way that Pea is.
He'd never let his innermost feelings
get in the way of his daily life.
There is only room for success, no failure allowed.
That's just how he's wired.
It's just a photo shoot. Why does it have to be so early?
They have the most beautiful sunrise here.
The sun doesn't rise in Taiwan?
Why do we have to come all the way here?
Exactly, and we can digitally enhance the pictures nowadays.
You'll be pleased with the results after you see the photos.
It's worth coming up here for the sunrise.
The sun is coming out. Get ready, okay?
Standby!
Do your final touch-up.
We need to give off a cheery feel, so bigger smiles.
-Okay. -Okay? Come on!
Okay, ready?
Okay, smile.
Okay, one more? Here we go.
Okay, change your pose.
Hold that pose.
-Please adjust your position. -Can I touch him like this?
Okay. Touch your hair.
Good. The light is perfect. You look beautiful.
The two of us suck at planning anyway.
Hey! I don't!
I just haven't really found something I want to plan for.
Yeah, right!
Hey! What about me?
You want to marry Dae Jung-geum?
-I thought you wanted to marry me! -What?
You want her to marry you,
so she can continue doing your work for you in Korea.
Well, then I think you'll have to come, too.
To help her do my work for me.
Please just have it, for planning the best trip of my life.
Good, let's continue. Bigger smiles, please?
More body language. Very good!
One more!
How about a "headache" pose?
Yes... having a headache!
How about a "stomachache" pose?
Got it. How about a "painful knees" pose?
Bend your body forward a little bit more.
Yes!
All three of you are supermodels.
Don't be a disgrace to Taiwan, okay?
-Let me tell you-- -Very good.
-You need to open up your body. -Okay.
Okay, that's rubbish.
Anyone can grow up.
Well, except DJs.
The problem is teenhood.
That's the time between 13 and 19 where everything's a mess.
Just like today,
it's the first day at junior college where,
until the exam results come out and our places confirmed,
the whole school is a mess of different school uniforms.
There are the green uniforms, the red uniforms,
the uniforms with the fake pin-on tie,
uniform with spots,
uniform without spots,
with sleeves,
without sleeves.
Kind of makes you wonder what's the point in wearing uniforms in the first place.
Yep, that's me. Mui Ee.
I hate introductions like this,
because I never know what to tell people about myself.
So I'll just tell you my name, and you figure out the rest.
Anyway, before today,
I thought I was handling teenhood pretty okay.
But then, that's teenhood.
It's like a long bus ride, right?
Just when you were getting comfortable,
everything comes to a complete stop.
I believe this is yours?
Yeah.
Hi. I'm Tom.
Tom...
Tom D'Cruz.
Sometimes people just make an impression on you.
It's not as if they have three eyes and two noses, or something.
Thomas Martyn D'Cruz was like that.
Not the three eyes and two noses.
I mean, the instance of meeting Tom
is like walking into a brick wall...
and liking it.
Every morning this man waits at the gate
in order to meet Miss Boon as she comes to school.
He is Mr. Robert Mills.
Expat teacher. Outspoken. Almost hip.
And totally out of place in the Singapore education system.
Mr. Mills, could you please move your bike so my fiancé can pass through?
Miss Boon. My class tutor.
The prettiest and nicest teacher in PJC.
Unfortunately for Mr. Mills, she's already engaged.
I hear there's a pool going around school on the odds of Mr. Mills
actually becoming Miss Boon's boyfriend.
No one's betting on Mr. Mills.
After you.
See that on the right?
That's the principal of PJC.
Dr. E Sopramaniam, MA, East Anglia, PhD, Calcutta.
Dr. E likes writing school rules as a hobby.
Here he is with a couple of students he caught
crossing the road 27 cm within the "No Crossing Zone."
What are your names?
Yeo Chung Kai.
Tua Pek Kong.
Yeo Chung Kai. Tua Pek Kong.
The guy on the left is Loo Kok Sean,
or Kok Sean as he calls himself.
Imagine a guy who oozes charm and intelligence,
and has the looks of an underwear model.
Now imagine the exact opposite.
That's Kok Sean.
Both of you, see me immediately after school today.
Yeo Chung Kai.
Well, the most outstanding thing about Kai
is that he's not outstanding at all.
He's a nice guy and accepts people at face value.
Which I guess is why he's stuck with Sean.
And let me just warn you.
Traffic accidents can be very dangerous to your health.
Because you can die from it.
And if you were to die, you will not complete your education.
Attention, attention, all students.
Welcome to Paya Lebar Junior College.
Good morning. This is your vice principal Mr. Ngor.
As this is your first day at the new school,
your principal Mr. E Soper... Sopra...
Your principal Dr. E, MA, East Anglia, PhD, Calcutta,
would like to talk to you all.
So all students, please proceed your way
towards the school hall in an orderly manner,
for Dr. E, MA, East Anglia, PhD, Calcutta,
to give you all the orientation address.
The PJC school motto is
"Forward Progress in the United March to Harmony and Personal Hygiene."
And what does this mean?
It means the formula for success
is 50% discipline, 50%...
What does that look mean?
Is it just a "Hello" look?
Or even a "Oh, Hello!" look.
Or what if it's a "Hello! I really like you" look?
I can't tell from here.
Actually, I'm not even sure if he's looking at me,
or look at someone else and I just happened to see him.
To enforce this rule, I've asked Farmi,
our school keeper, to electrify the school gate.
Standing with me is my best friend, Sissy Song.
Sissy's got everything handled so nicely.
Boys, school, parents.
If she were older than me,
she would probably become a model of who I want to be.
But nowadays, I'm just trying to keep up.
Stay away from him, Mui.
I didn't.
You don't have to, I can read your mind.
Sean, are you sure that line is going to work or not?
Kai, does a one-legged duck swim in circles?
Sean, I have no idea what that means.
Okay, let's move in.
Sean, maybe...
Another thing I forgot to tell you about Sissy.
She seems to attract boys like nectar attracts bees.
Hi, girls.
I can't help noticing that you were staring at me,
so I thought I'd introduce myself.
Hi, I'm Sean.
Or in this case, houseflies.
Come, Mui, let's go.
All hits all day, 987 FM.
That was "Falling in Love" by John Klass.
All hits all day, 987.
Hey, welcome in to the Ego Trip on 987 FM.
My name is Glenn Ong.
Giving the cool people the hits, and everyone else the fits.
Tonight we're going to be talking about first impressions.
Now, this seems like a pretty good topic,
considering that it's the first day of school and everything.
And there's probably a lot of first impressions being made.
Let's take our first caller, shall we?
6911987. Hello, Perfect Ten.
Hello? Hello? Glenn?
Yeah. My name is Juan.
Yeah, my problem is that today was my first day at school in JC, right?
So I made sure my uniform was, like, nice and neat and everything.
But I didn't know it was raining at my place last night, right?
So there were puddles of water everywhere.
And then just before I reached school, this Mercedes went by
and splashed muddy water over my uniform.
Anyway, I met my new classmates.
They all thought I was a slob and didn't want to sit next to me in class.
Well, Juan, I'm telling you. You are wrong.
I mean, it's the first day of school
and I'm sure you were just feeling insecure.
I mean, what gave you the impression that they thought
you were a slob and didn't want to sit next to you?
Because they said
"Juan, you're a slob and we don't want to sit next to you."
Okay, then that's a different story altogether.
And now moving on to our next caller on 6911987.
Hello, Perfect Ten.
Hello?
Hey, Mui! There's a party on Saturday.
Party?
Mui, you're in JC now. Your mother must give you more freedom.
But I never said...
How to make friends if you don't socialize?
Yeah, but I finish late, and then...
The whole gang will be there, and the guys,
Joseph, Yew Meng, Bernard.
Okay.
But you better stay away from Tom D'Cruz.
I think he's going to be there.
He's bad news.
Yeah, okay. Bye.
Bye.
What does Sissy know?
Tom's nothing like what people say he is.
In fact, he's just the opposite.
Sweet and cute.
In fact he's exactly the kind of wonderful guy,
who probably wouldn't be interested in me.
Sean, you almost hit that bus just now.
Kai, it's not my fault, okay?
Did you see the way it came into my lane?
But Sean, the bus was parked by the side of the road.
You can't tell from where you're sitting.
I think you just don't react quickly enough.
Kai, I have the reactions of a dolphin, okay?
Sean, I have no idea what that means.
987 FM. All hits all day.
And here's something interesting that happened today.
A teenager attempted to shoplift nine life jackets
by stuffing them into her jeans at a local store,
but accidentally pulled one of the release cords,
making the life jacket start to inflate.
Quick reaction from the staff saved the teenage shoplifter
from being suffocated in her own inflating jeans.
In defense, the teenager said that she had been hearing voices in her head,
saying, "Do it! Do it! Do it!"
Yes, I'm going to do it!
Watch out!
Sean, you're on the curb.
I'm going to call Sissy.
You mean she gave you her number?
Connections, man. You know the class list?
Class list?
How did you get that? She's not even in our class.
I told you, connections.
It's her, it's her.
Hello, is that Sissy Song?
Yeah, why?
This is your lucky day.
I'm the guy you met at the canteen, remember?
Loo Kok Sean.
Yikes! Dude, don't ever call me back. Go get a life!
I love you, too, babe.
You work really fast.
Now it's your turn. Call your Mui Ee.
Okay.
I'll do it.
Just not now.
Who was that, Sissy?
Some idiot who got my number.
Don't worry about it. Tonight we're going to party, right?
Kai, do you know we're on the curb?
Sissy, I don't know how you can be so enthusiastic about a party
and still get to it two hours late.
Two hours and twelve minutes, Mui.
Timing is everything.
Hi, Juan. How are you?
No one's here yet?
This is my friend Mui.
-Please say hi. -Welcome back to 987 FM.
You're on the Ego Trip, and my name is Glenn.
If you've just tuned in, we're on the topic of parties.
And with me for the very first time this evening,
Agony Uncle Dr. Adam Wong.
Now, Dr. Wong, we've got an email here from Hui Ni asking,
"What food should I serve at a party?"
Well, Hui Ni,
you don't have to bother about that question,
because thanks to my thorough research of teen culture,
I can tell you that teenage parties are not about food.
In fact, everyone stays away from the food,
and you can hardly see anyone
holding so much as a fork.
Really? So what do they do?
Teen parties are all about disco dancing.
Glenn, why, for a DJ, you're not as hip as me?
Teenagers love to disco dance.
Disco dancing.
How about making new friends, then?
No, no. No food, no socializing, no sitting down.
Everyone is too absorbed with disco dancing.
Especially when that groovy new disco song by ABBA is played.
-I see. -You look a bit worried, Glenn.
Don't worry. Even if you can't dance,
the most important thing is to make sure you get noticed.
Sean, do you think that I'm ugly?
Yeah, but that's not the point.
Then what?
You see, beautiful girls would go out with beautiful guys.
But beautiful girls will not marry good-looking guys
because the good-looking guys only want to go out with beautiful girls.
And that makes beautiful girls insecure.
So eventually, they'll marry someone who's boring and ordinary.
Like you!
So you see, my friend,
every girl, whether they're pretty or ugly,
only want emotional security.
Okay.
But... what do I do now?
Well, for now, I will go out with them.
And when it's time, I'll pass them to you.
What am I doing here?
Even if he didn't come to a party with a date,
I'm sure he has one by now.
Hi! Want a drink?
Hi. Yeah, okay.
-We met... -...on the bus.
-Your files... -...fell all over the bus.
-Do you always... -...complete someone else's sentence?
-Only when I'm... -...nervous?
Yeah.
Mui Ee!
-Juan and I are going to get some ice. -Yeah, we're out of ice.
Actually, Juan,
-why don't you go with Tom? -What?
I will go with Tom.
No, Mui. I don't think that's a very good idea.
I don't mind. I'll go with you.
Okay.
No, no. I'll go, okay? Let's all go.
Here, take my car.
Mui Ee!
You're not my mother.
I wish I know how to talk to them. I mean, talking to girls is like--
I know, it's like a delicate art form.
You remember that time I came back from England
and I started talking with a British accent?
No matter what I said,
the girls still think I'm a foreigner.
You were only there for five days, Sean.
I can't help it.
You know, I read somewhere about genetics
how guys can actually talk better to each other.
-Really? -Yeah.
Sometimes I think the problem lies with girls.
They don't want to communicate properly.
But why not?
They think it's more romantic.
For example,
you don't say to a girl, "Your eyes look good."
You must say,
"Your eyes are like two marbles in a sea of ivory."
But how will I know if she even likes ivory?
Talk to her! Get to know her!
I don't know how to talk to her, that's the whole point.
Yeah, you've got a point.
Hey, remember that movie that's like a MTV music video
about two lovers killing themselves?
-Romeo and Juliet? -Right, that's the one.
Where he thinks she's dead and he kills himself,
and she finds him dead and she kills herself.
Bad communication, boy.
But chicks love it.
This whole girl thing is sometimes so frustrating and confusing.
Girls love confusion.
It's in their genes. They can't help it.
Speaking of genes,
you know what's in my jeans for the past ten minutes?
No, Sean. I really don't want to know.
Ants.
And I think I'm sitting on their path.
Kai,
if you were to see the girl again, what would you say?
Who?
The girl you like, that Mui something?
Mui Ee?
Yeah, whatever.
I'd say, "Hi.
I'm Kai and you're Mui Ee, right?"
Again?
Again?
Say it again.
Hi, I'm Kai. You're Mui Ee, right?
Now say it!
Kai!
I'm Mui Ee, you're hi, right?
Need help?
No, thanks, buddy.
There are some things in life you can prepare too much for.
You imagine and you rehearse these things in your head over and over.
And you build up such a precise image of how it's going to happen.
But when it finally happens in a slightly different way,
you don't see it coming until it's just too late to react.
First kisses are like that.
Nothing you've ever imagined prepares you for it.
Once in a while you get that kind of a day
where things you believed would never happen actually happen.
That kind of a day when you get the feeling that
finally everything is going to work out right.
A day that you will never forget for as long as you live.
Attention, shoppers. Welcome to Borders.
Please note, in conjunction with the Child Safety Month at Borders,
that we're having a special sale for the following books.
Safety in the Home, Safety for Kids, The Guide to Safety for Children
and 1,000 Ways to Prevent Child Accidents.
Also, would the parents of 6-year-old Lew please come to the information counter,
as your son has accidentally swallowed one of our staplers.
Thank you.
"How to tell if you're in love?"
Please.
Jealous.
What?
Nothing.
Well, thanks for finding some time for your old friend.
I don't know where you've been these past few weeks.
Well, you know, here and there.
Is there anything going on between you two?
We're just friends, okay?
I mean, look, I want to help you
and some people are just not what they seem.
There're rumors about him and Maggie, okay?
Like, there're no rumors about you.
Mui, how long have we known each other?
Okay, whatever. Let's go to Starbucks.
Since kindergarten, and since that day, haven't I told you everything?
Please, okay, don't get so caught up
that you can't even tell who your friends are.
Look, I'm spending time with you, okay?
Can you stop being my mother?
All I'm saying is that--
Maybe I don't want to know what you have to say, okay.
This is my chance, okay, Sissy?
My chance to have a relationship for the first time in my life.
And for the first time in your life, you have to be a lamp post.
I'm just trying to help.
All those times in the past
when you used to go out with your boyfriends,
dragging me along and making me feel
as though I'm transparent.
I never do that.
You always do that, Sissy, always.
I bring you along because I wanted you to have fun as well.
Without me, you're just one big bookworm.
I'm not anymore.
Not anymore? You think you're so hot? You're nothing but ice cream.
Cold and cheap.
Say whatever you want, okay, Sissy?
I don't want to be stuck in an old friendship.
I don't want to be your shadow.
Then fine, go!
Hello, beautiful.
Tom, we're still in our school uniform.
Come on, let's go.
Why are you so late?
Sorry, lunch on me?
Tom, you idiot. I've been driving around and around for ten minutes.
Where have you been?
Late again?
Every time late.
Not now, Ma. Please?
Every time "Not now."
Ma...
So long I keep quiet and now I cannot keep quiet.
My mouth must open.
Ma...
Your father.
Sick, still work so hard.
I ask you to go and find tuition, still never do.
I said I was going to.
Say, say, say. Always say, never do.
Ma, it's been a difficult time at school, okay?
What's so difficult?
This is only the beginning.
Mrs. Phua say her daughter every day come back early.
Ma, can we talk about this some other time?
Every day I see your father.
And his daughter go where? Go disco.
I never go disco.
Then go where?
Go out with your boyfriend?
Don't think you are so clever.
I never do anything wrong.
I just go to school and sometimes I go out.
It's not easy, okay?
I am trying.
Tom?
Hi, may I please speak to...
Yeah?
Mui Ee, this is Kai.
Who is that? Why so late still call?
Who? It's not late.
Kai. It's about 9:00, but...
Kai?
Yeah.
I said hi to you, remember?
Put down the phone!
Why?
Nothing.
Well, actually, I just called because...
Who is that?
Ma, it's my friend, okay? Later, please?
Maybe I should call another time?
Yeah.
Okay, bye.
Wait...
Kai, right?
Yeah.
Sorry, I...
Hey, no, I understand.
Actually, well, I just called because...
Yeah?
Well...
I've seen you in school and I just want to say hi.
Yeah?
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Well,
if you need anyone, well, you know... Yeah.
Okay.
Take care, Mui Ee.
You, too.
Yeah?
Do you...
Never mind. Thanks anyway.
Anytime.
Bye.
Bye.
Attention, students and staff.
This is your principal Dr. E Sopramaniam, MA, East Anglia, PhD, Calcutta.
It has come to my attention that Valentine's Day is occurring next week.
This is a decadent colonial Western tradition.
And we in the East must preserve our values and not fall into this trap.
All lessons and extracurricular activities will proceed as usual on that day.
Teachers are to ensure discipline.
As students, your duty is to complete your education.
Not engage in permissive activities like sending poems or flowers.
And now Mr. Ngor has some announcements.
Thank you. The first announcement,
we have made special arrangements for students to get a discount
when you order your Valentine's flowers through your class representatives--
Mr. Ngor! I just told the students, no flowers.
Weren't you listening?
But all students must not order.
Thank you.
-Kai. -Yeah?
Can you molest Sissy so that I can save her
and she'll be eternally grateful
and will go out with me on Valentine's Day?
-Sean. -Yeah?
Have you ever gone for a CAT scan?
I don't have a cat.
So are you going to molest her or not?
Sometimes I wonder what goes on in your brain, okay?
Would you like a ride somewhere?
No, thanks. I'm waiting for Hari, my fiancé.
Well, there's no excuse for being late.
He's not, I'm early.
So, next week's the big day.
The big...
Right, yeah.
Are you sure you wouldn't like a ride?
Quite sure.
Well, see you.
-Miss Boon... -Yes?
Why do you hate me?
Hate you? I don't hate you.
Well, you seem so cold towards me.
I'm not.
Okay, I am. I don't mean to.
It's just that sometimes you're so...
ang moh, you know?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.
It's just...
I've got to go.
Bye.
Kai, do you know how much Sissy means to me?
-How much? -Well, a lot.
My Valentine's Day must not be wasted.
Every year, I date a beautiful woman,
and this year must not be different.
It's tradition, you know?
Look, if you're that desperate, why don't you go up to her and ask her?
Kai, I know that you have very little experience with women,
but surely you must know a high-quality woman like Sissy
wouldn't just go out with any Tom, Dick or Harry.
Let's eat out today.
Let me shower first?
Never mind.
Okay.
-Western? -Japanese?
Just keep driving.
So, how's your friend Mr. Mills?
You know, he can be really impossible sometimes.
He's so forward like only a Western-educated type can be.
But that's good.
You know, sometimes I think we're too reserved.
You see, kids these days, right,
don't know how to think, analyze. They don't even know how to speak.
It's because teachers like me aren't doing enough.
I didn't say that.
I did.
It's the education system.
The stress is always on the results.
You know, process, failure, and all that.
People don't understand that you can learn from making mistakes, from falling.
I think you missed the turn back there.
Shit.
Relax, honey. Learn from your mistake.
Attention, this is Dr. E Sopramaniam,
MA, East Anglia, PhD, Calcutta.
This is a reminder that all students and staff
will remain in school until the end of the school day.
And all educational activities will proceed as usual.
No one must leave the school premises to celebrate Valentine's Day.
We must always be alert and vigilant against these attacks...
What a day for the car to break down.
I hope the tow truck comes soon.
Some other horoscope said that it was going to be a good day for me today.
Who's that?
Sissy Song.
Fashionably late for the Valentine's party, as usual.
So happy that my life is going down the toilet.
No.
Hello, is anyone out there?
Michelle?
Shu Mei?
Hello?
Help! Help! Open the door!
Hello?
The walls are so clean and white.
Sissy Song, I've come to save you.
Isn't there anyone else around?
Sissy Song, coolest, prettiest girl in school.
You think you have the right to insult people, is it?
You're so cheap.
Look, you pervert. Just open the door.
Go out with me and I'll open the door.
Over my dead body.
Fine, then have a nice weekend.
Wait!
-Okay. -What?
I'll go out with you.
What? I can't hear you.
I said I'll go out with you.
I'll go out with you on one condition.
Anytime, my girlfriend.
I'm not your girlfriend and I'm bringing a friend along.
Who's he? What's his name?
It's a girl, you idiot. And you bring a guy friend.
What? Double date?
Well, take it or leave it. Now open the door.
You tell anyone about this,
I'll personally castrate you, understand?
I get to send you home?
Hello?
Hello, Kai?
-Sean, yeah? -Yeah, guess what.
I finally managed to convince Sissy
to ask that Mui something to go out with you.
What?
Wait. I'll tell you later.
Traffic police.
But it's Valentine's Day.
Every other girl in school has plans.
I'm going home now.
It's a tradition to have a date on Valentine's Day, Mui.
Well, I haven't lived long enough for any tradition.
Anyway, why does it have to be him of all people?
I told you that there was no one else around at that time
and at least you got Kai. I got that Kok Sean, okay?
And besides, you owe me. I warned you about Tom, remember?
And I got abuse from you in return.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Look, Sissy. You're my best friend, you should understand me.
Fine.
What are you doing?
Calling Sean. It's just going to be him and me. I'm gonna die.
Never mind, I'll go along.
Okay.
And that was an instrumental track from The Teenage Textbook Movie,
"Cocktail 17," right here on 987 FM.
Let's move on to our first caller on this Valentine's night.
Hello, Perfect Ten.
Hello, my name is Byron.
Yes, Byron, what's the problem?
Well, I'm a male model and girls like to ask me out on dates and stuff.
So, tonight I've got two girls who are very beautiful and rich,
so who do you think I should go out with?
Well, Byron, I think I know what the problem is.
-You do? -Yes.
The problem is...
people like you make me sick! Next caller. Hello?
Hello.
Michelle here. I'd just like to say
that I think Valentine's Day is a day created by corporations
in order to cheat people of their money
by selling them expensive cards and overpriced flowers.
I mean, every day should be Valentine's Day, right?
You don't need to have a special day to show someone that you really care.
Let me guess,
you didn't get a date for tonight, did you?
No...
Sean, why are you wearing those sunglasses?
The light's too glaring.
But it's nighttime.
Hey, isn't that a pimple?
No, it's not! Hey, look,
stop staring at me and keep your eyes on the road.
But you're the one that's driving.
Well, help me to look!
I can't see with these sunglasses on.
Sean! Watch out for the cat!
-Hello? -Hi, Mui Ee, it's me.
Tom?
Yep. I'll pick you up in ten minutes?
No! Wait! Tom, I'm not going out with you tonight.
Why not? Have to stay home and sulk, is it?
No, I have a date. It's not you.
Hey, if this is about Maggie...
I've got another call, Tom.
Hey, don't hang up on me.
Hello?
Mui Ee, we're downstairs already.
Come down now before I strangle Sean with the safety belt.
Okay.
I told you, no evidence.
Sean. I told you, no Pao-lo's.
I don't want a romantic restaurant.
I just want a place where we can get the food quickly, eat and go home.
Okay, my sweet Sissy. No Pao-lo's. Got it.
We'll go for somewhere classy but with fast service.
Sean, you just went through a red light!
Just take off those sunglasses before you get us all killed, okay?
Don't worry, I'm just here to pick up some cakes.
We're not going to be eating here.
So...
how well have you known Sissy?
We've been best friends for about eight years now.
Eight years.
Well, me and Sean about the same time as well.
You know, Sean can be quite a pain sometimes,
but if you really get to know him, he's really very nice.
He got a date with Sissy and he asked me to come along.
Actually, I'm here because of Sissy as well.
Yeah.
Of course I know.
Well...
since this is Valentine's Day,
why not let's make the most of it?
Okay.
You look really nice tonight.
Thanks, you, too.
Thanks.
I hope the waiter doesn't give Sissy any sharp utensils.
Don't worry. At the rate Sean's going,
he'll probably stab himself with the bread knife
before Sissy gets a chance.
Yeah, right.
You know, actually, if you think about it,
do you think Sean and Sissy look compatible?
I don't think so. I mean, he's not her type.
Okay. But...
if Sissy never finds that special someone,
maybe she'll just have to settle for Sean, right?
I guess so.
But I think when you meet that special someone, you'd feel magical?
How's your evening been?
Good.
Tonight you go home yourself, okay?
I've got Sissy eating out of my hand.
Okay, sure. We'll just take a cab.
Thanks, friend.
Anytime, friend.
Did you enjoy your Valentine's Day dinner, Mui Ee?
Tom!
Come on, let's go. You have a date with me, remember?
What are you doing?
Leave her alone.
And you're going to make me?
Get lost, Tom.
Let's go, Mui.
The next track goes out to all Valentine's Day suckers.
May your overpriced dinner be worth it in the end.
Sean, this had better be important. I was peeing halfway.
You know what it's like when you stop and I'm still in my boxers and--
Hello? Chung Kai?
Mui Ee?
Sorry for calling so late.
Late? No, it's not late.
It's a bad time, right?
No, not at all.
You need to go?
No, I can control.
You want to put something on first?
No.
I mean, I will.
Well,
I just wanted to know if you got back safely.
Yeah.
And I had a really good time.
Me, too.
Look, I've got to go. My dad's around.
Okay. I'll see you at lunch tomorrow?
Why?
I mean, sure! Yeah, of course! Yes.
Okay, bye.
Bye.
Sometimes, despite your best efforts,
life follows a very different path
from the one you planned and worked towards.
And if the results are not so bad,
do you just go along with whatever's happening,
or try to put your life back on the other track
and wait for that special someone that's meant for you?
So, where are we going?
Paya Lebar Hawker Centre.
We'll take the bus. It'll be my treat.
Luxury date.
Our results are coming out next week. How do you think you'll fare?
Okay. You?
Same here.
987, all hits all day.
It's 1:30 a.m. on the Ego Trip on 987 FM.
And from my understanding,
there are only nine 16 year-olds who are asleep,
because the O-Level results are being released later today.
As for the rest, I'm sure many of you are anxious
about whether you'll be staying or changing schools.
So if you are, why not give us a call right now and talk to us on 6911987.
Hello, Perfect Ten.
Hello? Hi, my name is Kok...
Kok Sean.
Okay, Kok Sean. So what's on your mind?
Well, let's say...
Let's say tomorrow if my friend got the results
and he gets an A1 when he usually fails.
I mean, they wouldn't try to see if I'd bought the answers
from some guy in the alley who actually tried to charge me
twice the amount but luckily I didn't bring my wallet.
Right. Yeah, something like that.
You mean like cheating?
Well, cheating is such a strong word.
How about creative exam-taking?
I'm not so sure.
Well, let me see.
Your number starts with 46.
You must be living somewhere in Bukit Timah, right?
Are you trying to trace my call?
-No, of course not. -Okay, bye.
Exam results are the most stressful thing in the world.
A simple alphabet and a number determines the school you can go to,
what courses you can take,
and what jobs you end up with later in life.
It's a turning point you have no control over.
Kai got his results earlier in the morning and paged me to tell me the bad news.
And while I waited for my own results,
I didn't know whether to hope for the best,
or maybe even to get results that weren't so great,
so that Kai and I would still end up in the same school,
wherever that turned out to be.
Tears of sadness and tears of joy.
This was the scene today
as the O-Level examination results were released.
Not only are the students here at Kampong Arang Secondary School
hopeful of retaining their places at their favorite colleges,
but those who hadn't previously qualified are hoping
that their final results will also secure them places at their colleges.
GCS spoke to a few of them.
I've got ten A1s.
I'd like to thank all of those that helped me
and I'm really grateful to them.
And my geography teacher,
my physics teacher, my biology teacher,
my geography teacher, everyone!
Including my dog!
Even if I failed, I think it'd be okay.
I'll look on the bright side.
Besides, I think it'd be cool if I can spend
another year in school with my friends, you know.
But won't your friends be going on to other junior colleges
and aren't you afraid of being left behind?
Shit!
But you can stay at PJC, right?
I don't know.
I'm sure you can, Kai. I mean, PJ is not, like, a top college.
Anyway, you're going to a top college, right?
I'm not sure.
Kai, it's not that...
I have to go!
Wait, Mui. Can't we just...
See? See? You see?
Ma, we're just friends.
Just friends!
Some people got boyfriend, want to blab other people?
Ma, I did well on my O-Levels, and it's only my first year.
I think you should stop your studies.
Education, education. Where education?
What you do?
Every day go out, come back late. Still talk on the phone.
What for study? Go out and work better.
Why can't you trust me?
Trust you?
I trust you.
You say promise.
You say won't go out late, won't talk to boys on the phone.
You say promise. I listen. I trust.
Now you see what happened?
What? What happened? What did I do?
You blab me! Your own mother!
Hey, I haven't finished with you...
From now on,
every day you must come back early!
You cannot go out with boys and you cannot use the phone!
Mui, I really don't see what the problem is.
If I were you, I'll tell my mother that I'll stop seeing Chung Kai.
Then I'd say I'm with my girls whenever I'm on a date with him.
Yeah, but what if she finds out?
How would she find out?
I mean, what if our relatives and friends see me and Kai together?
She'll kill me for lying to her.
But you're already lying to her.
No...
Well, you tell her that he's just a friend,
which he isn't. So you're lying.
So I should lie more?
No, you should hang on to Kai because you'll never find another one like him.
Yeah, he's cute, right?
Well, I don't really know about that, but he's got
"dependable" and "stable" written all over his face.
You know, you should find someone like him.
Yeah, right, someone like him, I'll get diabetes.
Sissy's rule number 38,
my man's got to have the body of a swimmer,
the mind of a computer programmer and the personality of a rabbit.
Personality of a rabbit?
You know, tame.
Rabbits have no personality.
Okay, whatever that's kind and gentle,
and worships me morning, noon, and...
Meow.
Morning, noon and meow?
Mui, slap me.
Tan, broad shoulders.
Must be a swimmer.
Except for the fact that his hair wasn't shoulder-length,
Daniel Boon was the kind of guy you’d find painted
on the covers of teenage romance novels.
And Sissy Song was the kind of girl who bought these books just for the covers.
I'd like to see him in a pair of Speedos.
Sissy...
You won't understand. You're practically married.
Yikes.
Speedo Boy is that weirdo's friend.
Can you tell me where the library is?
The library? Don't you know where it is by now?
-Well, I'm-- -Second intake student.
Yeah.
Nice watch, but mine's better.
I'm Daniel. You are?
Very rich.
But you can call me Sean.
So, Daniel, what's your calling in PJC?
Calling?
Your class.
Class S34A.
Isn't that where Shu Mei and Madeline and Ding Wei are?
Yeah, I think so.
So Mr. Mills teaches your class?
Yeah, that's the one.
So, have they told you about Mills and Boon?
No.
Well, people are saying Mr. Mills is sleeping with Miss Boon.
Miss Boon is my sister.
Yeah, right. And I'm James Lye.
She is.
I'm Daniel Boon.
Daniel Boon?
Wait.
So you are Miss Boon's brother?
Don't take me seriously, I'm always joking. See?
Look, can you just tell me where the...
What?
Hot babe.
Sissy. Sissy Song.
Sissy Song.
Yeah.
My girlfriend.
Yeah, right.
You don't believe me?
Come on! I'll introduce you.
Hi, babe. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Daniel Boon.
Hi, I'm Daniel.
Well, got to go. Bye.
Cool girlfriend.
She's the best.
You're one lucky man.
I sure think so.
If there's one thing I like about Sissy,
it's that she never lets her prejudice get to her.
I guess she figured that if Kai was Sean's friend,
and he was okay,
then there's a remote possibility that Dreamboat Daniel
might turn out to be okay, too.
All she needed to do was to turn on the old Sissy charm.
Hi, Daniel.
Hi, Sissy.
How's things?
Okay, what about you?
All right, just trying to catch up on what I've missed.
Maths! I hate it. I can't even get my tutorial done.
Maybe I can help.
Yeah, I was hoping that you'd say that.
And, of course,
Sissy forgot to mention that she had just got A1 in her O-Level maths.
Thanks for your help.
If only Mrs. Louise can teach math like you.
It's easy when you like the...
subject.
It's been a pleasure working with you.
Yeah, and walking with you.
-I'm taking 92. -Me, too!
I thought you're going the other direction.
I need to go somewhere first.
Let's not go back yet, okay?
Let's go and catch a movie.
Movie?
It's the middle of the week.
So?
Kai, don't make this difficult.
Anyway, you should go home and finish your history essay.
I have enough time to do it tonight.
Please, let's just go out, okay?
Another time, okay?
I'm not asking you to take drugs or something, you know.
Why doesn't your mother understand?
Okay. What about Saturday?
Every time Saturday. When the day comes, you say next Saturday.
We haven't done anything for weeks, okay?
Kai, my mother thinks that you'll cause my downfall.
I'll spend all my time talking to you on the phone,
skipping classes, failing classes,
getting pregnant and all that.
Tell you what,
we'll catch the 5:45 show and we'll be back by 8:00, okay?
-I promise. -Kai, what do you want from me?
I just want to watch a movie.
Any movie, a Hindi movie. I don't care. As long as I'm watching it with you, Mui.
I can't.
I think you should just go and become a nun.
Every bit of my brain is telling me that Kai's being unreasonable.
So why am I feeling like the bad guy?
Why do I feel like I'm the one who just drove away in a car
and left him alone at the bus stop?
I mean,
I like being around Kai and all that.
But what if he's not the one?
All hits all day, 987 FM.
Hello, Glenn, this is Melissa.
Yes, Melissa. What's your question?
How will I know when I find true love?
Love question.
Dr. Adam, what do you think?
Does true love even exist?
I'd like to think so, Glenn.
So how will I feel when I meet him? Will I just know?
Melissa, there's no Spider-Sense that will tingle to tell you
who's the one and who's not.
You have to really get to know that person.
So, Adam, have you found true love?
I have, Glenn.
I met her seven years ago and last year, I made her mine.
Only last year?
I thought you got married much earlier.
No, Glenn. I bought my 1967 BMW convertible last year.
She was a real beauty.
Real leather seats, original steering wheel,
wood paneling, V12 engine,
200 horsepower. It's a fantastic job...
Hello?
Hello, can I speak to Sissy, please?
Yes?
Hi, Sissy. It's Daniel.
I think I took your book by mistake.
Really?
Yeah. Probably my fault. I must have switched it when we were doing maths.
It's okay, no problem.
I'll pick it up from you tomorrow,
and I think I should give you a reward for finding my book.
Yeah, sure. What about a drink tomorrow?
Okay, 1:30 after class?
Great.
Daniel, do you like rabbits?
What do you mean?
Never mind.
Hey.
Are you taking part in the PJC contest next week?
I don't know.
Why not?
I'm sure you'll win. I mean, who else can beat Sissy Song?
I'll even be your manager.
You know, you're the second person who offered.
The first was your friend, Kok Sean.
My friend...
Look, I have to go.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay? Bye.
Who is it?
Chong Gay.
Chong Gay? Every time Chong Gay.
Mui, I feel like I'm being juggled around.
I just don't know what to do with Daniel.
Well, Sissy, I guess for once you'll just have to get used
to not being in control of the relationship.
Hey, I have no problems with not being in control.
It's the not-understanding part that I don't, you know, understand.
Okay, so he asked to be your manager for the beauty contest, which is good.
And then you had cappuccinos together and nothing happened,
which is bad.
But at least now you know how I feel,
-which is good. -No, it's worse.
I mean, I've read some of these kinds of stories
and I know he feels it, too, but nothing.
Mui, this has never happened to me before.
-And look. -Where?
I mean look, but don't look.
He's always with that Chong Gay guy.
Do you think Daniel is...
Daniel? But...
But Daniel is sweet and helpful and...
Well, he likes to swim and he likes his mother.
Oh, my God. Daniel?
Go talk to her.
I want to but...
she's with Sean.
I don't want to cause their breakup.
Honey, you'll be doing them a favor.
Hi, Miss Boon.
-Join us. -Sure.
How's work?
Okay. Actually, Miss Boon...
Mui has something to ask you.
Yeah, you said you wanted
to ask Miss Boon something, something, something.
Something, something, something?
Yeah, quick, ask.
What is it?
If a girl likes this guy...
And she's quite cute.
Not all the time.
Well, this cute girl likes this cute guy.
And the guy doesn't respond. So what do you think is the problem?
-Well-- -I mean, Miss Boon,
you're old and all that. You have a lot of experience.
Have you come across anything like that before?
Well, in the first place,
just because a girl is cute doesn't mean every guy is going to be attracted to her.
But what if she's really gorgeous?
Well, there could be a number of reasons.
Okay, let me tell you a story.
When I was in uni, there was this girl in my class.
She was absolutely gorgeous. Model. Top of the faculty.
And, of course, all the boys were throwing themselves
at her feet from morning to night.
But she had her sights set on only this one guy.
This one guy only who was smart like her. Swimmer. Perfect body.
But, you know, he just didn't seem interested in her.
What happened in the end?
I mean, was he gay or what?
No.
But she got married to someone else,
had three kids, migrated to Australia.
And never found out why this guy didn't like her.
You told them about Gabrielle going to Perth.
Sure.
Just to show them that they're not
going to find simple solutions to everything in life.
Isn't that just a little too cynical for kids their age?
But they're not kids anymore, Hari.
These are grown-up problems.
I know some people our age are still having problems like these.
Hey, I think you're referring to your friends, not mine. okay?
What? How can you say that after the way Jack showed us
how you could burp to the tune of "La Bamba"?
I can't imagine the Air Force
gives you guys million-dollar planes to fly.
Bye.
Debbie, Debbie.
What is it, Ma?
I...
I think it's Daniel.
He likes boys.
This whole thing with Daniel and Chong Gay was just driving Sissy crazy.
Her not knowing if he is or isn't.
It's so hard to tell nowadays.
Sissy's a take-charge kind of person.
But how can you take charge if you don't know who's what?
She told me she was going home to meditate until she figured out a solution.
I hope she figures out a solution soon,
because there's only so much meditation a person's metabolism can take.
And as for things between Kai and me,
well,
instead of letting this whole situation get out of hand,
I decided to get off my butt and do something about it.
So I figured that if Ma could actually meet Kai,
she might stop thinking of him as some boy, but as a real person.
So I asked if Kai could come over for dinner.
Well, maybe she was feeling generous,
or even just as tired as I was of the whole thing,
because she actually said yes.
Hello?
Hi, Sissy? Hi, it's Daniel.
Are you busy?
No, why?
Look...
Would you like to have dinner with me?
Okay.
There's a condition, Sissy.
Yeah?
If you come for dinner,
I'd like you to...
become my girlfriend.
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah, okay!
Let me explain.
You see,
my parents think that I'm...
gay.
Is it true?
It's a long story.
You see, whenever I'm talking to you on the phone,
I tell them that I'm talking to another guy.
Well, I didn't want them to think that I'm always out just chasing girls.
Which guy?
Chong Gay.
Anyway, I kind of told them that I have a...
girlfriend.
You.
So... will you do it?
Please?
I won't ask anything else.
Okay.
Great. Thanks.
Woman, help me out.
Now what?
I need your advice on what to wear on a date.
You, Sissy Song, asking moi for advice?
Okay.
First, you should wear a bra.
Okay, that's a good point, but what else?
I mean, his parents are like the conservative, boring type.
I have to dress like you.
Okay. First, you choose a color.
Black?
No.
Red?
No.
Black and red?
No, not really.
Do you have something, like, lighter, pastel or beige?
I think I've got a peach dress somewhere.
Okay.
Now shoes.
I've got black leather boots that can go very well as shoes.
Sis, Mui's rules.
No black, no leather, no boots.
All hits all day, 987 FM.
Welcome back to 987 FM.
We're on the topic of meeting parents.
Hello, Perfect Ten?
Hi, Glenn. My name is Chong Gay.
And I was just listening to what the previous caller said,
and I just want to say that I was offended and disgusted
by what she said she was going to do.
But all she said was that
she was going to wear her mom's silk dress
and conservative leather shoes to meet her boyfriend's parents.
Well,
I think she's just trying to be controversial by telling us that.
I mean, she shouldn't even attempt to wear a silk dress with leather.
The fabrics just clash, man. It's as good as yelling,
"Hello, world, look at me!
I don't understand my hard and soft fabrics."
What?
That outfit is not very you.
I really appreciate what you're doing for me.
Girlfriend for a day.
Now I know what a social escort feels like.
I'm just kidding, don't worry.
I'll look at you with such longing
that your mother will never know that I'm just...
Just pretending.
-Hello Miss Boon. -Hello, Sissy.
You're looking tame.
It's my new look, Miss Boon.
Yeah, right.
Mom, Daniel's friend is here.
See you, kids. Enjoy yourselves.
-Bye. -Bye.
So, you are Sissy.
Hi, Auntie.
Come. Come in and sit down.
I like your dress. It's very pretty.
Thank you, Auntie. It's a gift from Daniel.
Really? Where did you buy it from, Dan?
Club 21.
Sissy, would you like a drink?
No, thank you, Auntie. I'm fine.
So how long have you known each other?
-Three months. -Three weeks.
How long?
-Three weeks. -Three months.
You're confusing me.
What we mean is...
What do we mean, Sissy?
We mean that we met three months ago,
but only confirmed our relationship three weeks ago.
-Right? -Right, right.
Mom, don't you have to go?
It's getting late.
Excuse me, I must go to my mahjong game.
You know, Sean?
I heard Sissy's going to be taking part in the Miss PJC pageant.
Yeah, she's sure to win.
Everybody knows that.
That's true.
But I also heard that Linda's going to take part as well.
I hope not.
You know she gets so emotional about losing,
plus, she always comes crying to you when that happens.
I know.
Kai, aren't you a little underdressed tonight?
I mean, at least a tie, right?
What do you mean?
I mean, when you propose to Mui.
Sean, I'm just meeting Mui's mom tonight.
I'm not getting engaged, you know.
Okay.
So I guess there won't be a bachelor party next week.
Nope.
Thanks for the lift.
You can go now.
But it's going to rain.
You have a car.
But this is going to be fun.
I mean, I've never been inside a three-room HDB flat before.
It's good to see how the other side lives.
Which number? Is it this one?
What's the number? You must tell me.
Which number is it?
13-05.
I know it's this one.
13...
No, it's not.
Here, 13-05.
Sean, can you just leave before someone comes out?
Hi, Kai.
Hi, Sean.
Come inside, come inside.
Mom, this is Kai and Sean.
-Hi, Auntie. -Hi, Auntie.
So where's the rest of the house?
I feel like Japanese food tonight.
You want to try The Okinawa at Shenton Way?
No, I think you should just keep driving.
You know we can't get a table at Okinawa, not at this hour.
Yeah.
You hungry?
Yes, very.
You know, I've been thinking...
about what you said the other day, about, you know...
talking and being open.
Yeah?
Well, Deb.
I don't just want you to be my fiancée,
I want you to be my wife.
We'll have a terrific wedding.
A military wedding.
And my squadron can perform a fly-past.
We'll have the best wedding ever.
I don't care about the wedding as long as you are--
We'll be the happiest couple on earth,
and after the wedding, it's off to Australia we go.
Sydney, here we come.
Hari, please. I've been to Australia.
Let's go to Europe for our honeymoon.
Honeymoon?
No, no. I meant that we should move to Sydney.
I've got two uncles living there already, so it won't be a problem.
We can bring our kids up as Australian.
Wouldn't that be great?
But I don't want to spend the rest of my life in Australia.
We can come back once or maybe twice a year.
You're not listening, Hari.
I don't want to spend the rest of my life--
Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me?
Look, Deb.
You know how I feel about living here, right?
And you,
you keep complaining about your job all the time.
You hate being a teacher.
You always complain about everything from the Ministry of Education,
to the weather,
-to the-- -You're not being fair.
I love being a teacher.
And this is my home.
All my friends are here, my family is here.
And you think I'm about to give all this up
just to follow you to some strange country
and start rebuilding my life all over again?
But my uncle's already got me a job as a navigator
on one of the domestic airlines there.
Don't you see? We've got it made.
And I guess you didn't think it was necessary to consult me.
I mean,
you just thought I'd go along with whatever you decided.
Why didn't you tell me?
You, of all people.
Okay. I'm sorry, all right?
I just wanted to pick the right time to tell you, that's all.
Look.
Just say yes, okay?
Why? Why do you want to leave?
Why do you want to stay?
If I decide to stay, what will you do?
It's not fair.
Don't ask me to make that sort of choice.
Look...
I want to go.
I'm asking you to make that choice.
I need to know.
I don't like your boyfriend.
No manners.
You just met him.
Five seconds, already I can tell.
The way he looked at our flat. Too low-class for him.
He's no good.
You cannot go out with him.
Ma, just give him a chance. okay?
How do they live here?
I mean, where does the maid sleep?
They don't have a maid.
That's not funny, Kai.
What?
Next you'll be telling me they don't even have a car.
Sean, if you don't go now, I'm gonna throw you down a corridor.
Talking about corridor, shouldn't it be wider or something?
I mean, what if someone wants to buy a piano and they--
-Go. -Okay, okay.
-No air-- -Sean, just please go now, okay?
Where did Kai go?
I'm Kai, Auntie.
Sean has something on, so he left first.
You are Kai?
Yeah.
You are Kai!
Thanks, Auntie.
No promises.
They never deliver here.
Somehow this area doesn't exist to them.
So what would you like?
A Tahiti Supremo or a Singapore Special?
I don't really like those.
Well, neither do I.
But I think that's the only two kinds that they have.
That's where you're wrong.
Those are the only two kinds that they think they have.
Watch and learn.
Hello, pizza delivery?
Yes, hi.
May I find out what kinds of pizza do you have?
Okay, Tahiti Supremo and Singapore Special?
Fine.
But say I'm allergic to certain ingredients.
Do you actually take special orders?
Okay, thank you.
She's checking.
What exactly are you allergic to?
What do you mean? Haven't you seen my reaction to boring food?
Hello, yes, sorry. I'm still here.
Okay, this is my order.
I'm going to have Tahiti Supremo but no capsicum, please.
Just olives and mushrooms.
Yep.
And no anchovies, please.
Okay, great.
Can I have
the garlic for garlic bread, instead of the normal, ordinary garlic?
Yeah, okay.
Thank you.
Hello?
The cheese topping, please make sure that it's freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
Yes, only freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
Thank you.
Got it?
Great, 221B Radley Road.
Okay, thank you very much.
What?
That was...
That was amazing. I mean,
you just got them to create a whole new pizza for us.
Well, some people are good with computers
and some people are just good with pizza deliveries.
Ma, Kai and I will clear up.
Yeah.
Got a boy, now you're so hardworking.
Ma...
Auntie go downstairs for a while.
Auntie go first.
Walk properly, Auntie. Floor very slippery.
Bye, Ma.
She's going to adopt you now.
Mui.
You know tomorrow, right,
we finish classes early because of the beauty contest.
Do you want to catch a movie?
Maybe.
Why?
Well,
because I thought since we're going to the ball on Saturday...
So...
So, what?
Well...
Forget it.
Just forget that I mentioned it, okay?
Kai, it's not that I don't want to go.
Then what?
You asked me for dinner, I'm here.
Your mother is great.
I really like her and I think she likes me, too.
So what is the problem?
What does it take for you to go on a movie with me?
What, Mui Ee?
Now you can tell your mother
that you're talking to me whenever you're talking to me.
Thanks for coming over.
And thanks for being my girlfriend.
Yeah, for tonight.
I have to go.
Why don't I send you home?
No, it's okay.
Can you help call a cab?
It's easy to get one outside.
I'll walk you out.
No, really, it's okay.
Thanks for dinner.
You.
Don't scratch my car.
Her hair looks nice tonight.
I haven't reached the high yet.
I'm going to wish her luck.
Hi, Nikky.
Hi, Sean.
Hello, Sissy. You paged?
Yeah, Mui. Why don't you come down?
Don't you have your Miss PJC contest to do?
Yeah, it's coming up soon. Why don't you come down?
I can't, Sissy.
I don't know what to say to Kai.
I don't know what to do.
But you must come.
I'm just not in the mood, okay?
Look.
How long are you going to agonize over this?
Are you going to avoid Kai like you did to Tom?
Maybe you should give Kai a chance.
He might not turn out to be another
romance-novel hunk like Tom D'Crap.
But I'm not looking for another Tom.
So are you looking for another Kai?
Just not tonight, okay?
I just want to be alone.
Then let's do something instead.
Sis, you stay there and win.
And, yes, I want you to do something.
What?
I want you to talk to Daniel.
There's nothing to talk about.
I just have to accept reality and the reality is
he's just not interested.
Anyway, I have to go. Wish you were here.
Okay.
Tell me all about it tomorrow, okay?
Good luck.
Sissy, can you tell us what's your idea of a perfect boyfriend?
I think
a perfect boyfriend should be a perfect gentleman.
She looks good, doesn't she?
Where's Mui Ee?
At home.
Sometimes I just don't understand.
...before she deserved him.
Well put.
"My Special Angel" by Ger. On 987 FM, for you,
if you're stuck at home right now on this Saturday night.
Why aren't you out with your friends? Had a fight?
Or worse still, no friends?
What's wrong with you?
Life is short.
Turn around if you're going the wrong way.
I thought you had a school party to go to.
Ma.
Leave it alone, don't throw it away.
If you don't want it, throw it away.
If you want it, treat it properly.
Hi, Miss Boon.
What are you doing after this?
Going home.
Say we hang around, and "La Bamba."
"La Bamba"?
Mills.
Sometimes I get really worried about you.
Anyway, I've got to meet someone.
What? The fighter-pilot guy?
Yeah.
The fighter-pilot guy.
What about us?
Us?
There's no us, Mills.
You're my colleague. We're friends.
Is that all?
All hits all day, 987 FM.
Uncle, are you sure this is the fastest way there?
Don't worry, miss.
My taxi is always the fastest one.
In ten minutes, you'll be at your party.
Okay.
Here's a clue to what's wrong with this picture.
You're here, and she's at home.
Come on, Kai. Talk, shout, cry, whatever.
But sitting here is not going to solve anything.
Yeah, I know.
Come on, we're "action" men.
We're buddies, remember?
Hey, that's Nikki.
Hi, Nikki.
Look, I got to go.
Call Sissy, she'll knows what to do.
Chung Kai, I've lost again.
It's okay, Linda.
Great.
Mui Ee.
Congrats.
Congrats?
I don't care what anyone else says.
I think you're the true princess.
Daniel, what do you want from me?
Why do you keep playing this game?
I just don't want to...
You know.
No, I don't know.
Look, I know you and Sean are having some problems.
I don't want to make it any worse.
What? I mean, what Sean?
Your boyfriend?
My what? You've got to be kidding.
Wait.
You mean you're not with...
Which means you're...
Yeah!
But you were... you know... in me.
Why didn't you...
I mean, I thought that you're...
You thought that I was...
Yeah, I mean, you cook and you love your mom.
So?
I know, so...
You're not...
Which means...
Mui Ee.
I couldn't have come at a better time.
What's next? Get a room here?
What are you talking about?
Don't use jealousy as an excuse, okay?
What excuse?
I don't know. To get rid of me?
I'm not getting rid of you.
Then what?
Mui, I know how I feel about you, but can you say the same about me?
Don't confuse me, okay?
Look.
Are you still waiting for that special someone?
I don't know.
Why?
I don't know.
Why?
I said I don't know, Kai.
Yeah, and I want to know why.
If it's not your mom, not school,
it's not exams, not me.,
it's not anything, then what is it?
I don't know.
I just don't know, okay?
I don't want to lose you.
I don't want to buy a present, wrap it up,
get all excited about giving it to you
and then see you with another girl.
I don't want to go out for the sake of going out
and then break up when it's not fun anymore.
I mean, if I didn't care for you so much, it wouldn't hurt when you leave.
Who says I'll leave?
What have I done to make you feel that?
I don't know.
Not now.
Maybe next week, next month, next year.
Mui, what are you talking about?
I know I'm not making sense, okay?
But that's just how I feel.
Yeah, that's just how I feel.
So, when are you leaving?
Next week, on the fourth.
It's just an initial visit to see my uncle.
I'll send him my papers in about two to three months' time, then...
I guess you're really going.
I can't stay.
Finally, in my life, I meet someone I love.
The fighter-pilot guy.
And it's over.
I'll write to you.
What's the point?
You know, we should just go our separate ways.
Who knows?
We might bump into each other when we're, say, 70?
Not me.
I'm going to die young.
That explains the way you drive.
Bye, Hari.
I'll miss you.
Bye.
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
Sorry for mistaking you for my friend's sister.
Sorry for giving you a lift home
and ending up shopping for carpets.
Sorry for those long, endless drives along the east coast.
Sorry for falling in love with you.
I'm sorry.
I'm not.
Take care, Hari.
Bye.
Bye.
Can't the DJ play a fast song?
You want him to get stoned to death, is it?
The couples here waited all night for this.
And Mui, can you take care of my bag for me?
Hello, Sissy?
Sissy, you have to talk to Mui for me.
I mean, I know we have our problems,
but we can take it one step at a time, right?
And I'm sure there's special feeling.
We just have to believe in it for it to work out, right?
I just won't let her give up on us, because I'm not.
You have to tell her. okay, Sissy?
Will you do that for me, please?
Hello?
Hello, Sissy?
Hello? Are you there?
You really look nice tonight.
Thanks. You, too.
Hi.
Hi.
You look nice tonight.
Thanks.
And so,
despite all our friends, parents, school and stuff,
we survived teenhood
and lived happily ever after.
You know, maybe someone should write a book about this.
DOCTOR: One or two? -One.
ADAM: What I would've given for a classic case of glaucoma.
DOCTOR: Okay, we're done.
ADAM: 'Cause soon after...
...I started hearing the voices.
VOICE 1 [WHISPERING]: This way. DARKNESS [DEEP VOICE]: Adam.
VOICE 2 [WHISPERING]: Don't go this way.
VOICE 3 [WHISPERING]: Listen. VOICE 1: Come on. You can do it.
DARKNESS: Adam.
I'm sure they told you about the cooking.
Call it what you want. A distraction, self-medicating, whatever.
But it was the only thing that could make them shut up.
You okay?
ADAM: And don't blame my mom for not figuring it out sooner.
She had a lot going on the past couple years.
When my dad decided
the whole fatherhood thing was a buzzkill for his creativity,
we had to take the shit sandwich we'd been served and make it edible.
So, I cooked.
And cooked.
And the meals became my contribution to our underdog story.
Mm! Sweetheart, it's delicious.
ADAM: Plus, I got really good at it.
Mm. It's just the right amount of cumin.
ADAM: And then Paul moved in.
Mm. It's interesting.
It's so good, honey. I love it.
ADAM: Home, as I knew it, became a thing of the past.
ADAM: So, I was getting out a lot.
Getting into cooking school next fall was like an oasis
from the dumpster fire my brain was slowly becoming.
I just needed to keep my eye on the prize and bide my time.
How hard could it be to hide my burgeoning insanity
from the unforgiving ecosystem that is high school?
Check this out. We finally got invited to one of Sarah's parties.
We can't miss this one, man. You're coming, right?
I'll pick you up tonight?
Who is that?
Sarah? The love of my life?
ADAM: I mean, for a while, they were just voices.
Yeah, right. Sarah.
So, my parents are on another trial separation, whatever.
But I can guilt them into letting me take the car.
What do you say, for the party?
I'm telling you, I think tonight's...
DARKNESS: Adam.
TODD: Adam, yo.
DARKNESS: Over here.
-What? -Careful, this shit's like lava.
-Sorry. -What are you doing?
ADAM: Right here, Adam.
Todd.
REBECCA: Adam.
We need to leave now.
Don't worry, boss. We got this.
TODD: Do something, please!
TODD: That hurts! It hurts!
Hey, kid. Kid!
You want us to protect your scrawny ass or what? Beat it.
Adam, go.
Calm down, son. Calm down.
Just calm down, son. Calm-- Just calm down. It's okay.
Just calm down, son. Calm down.
ADAM: Let go of me! GUARD: Just breathe.
Just calm down.
Relax. Relax. Just breathe.
ADAM: They called it my first psychotic break.
Hello. ADAM: And that's when we found out what I am.
Schizophrenia, a chronic mental disorder
in which a person loses touch with reality,
allowing for visual and auditory hallucinations,
paranoia, delusions.
Hence the chemistry class extravaganza.
A cornucopia of shit, basically.
Never goes away, never normal.
The end.
First, they expelled me from school.
Hey, um, are you still going to Sarah's party next weekend?
ADAM: Todd's burn was so bad, they had to take skin grafts from his ass.
Where's your straitjacket, freak?
ADAM: Now he hates me.
-Hey, come on, guys, go to class. BOY: Freak.
ADAM: They all do.
Then Paul hid all the knives.
PAUL: I'm just gonna say this.
Maybe we should send him someplace that knows how to take care of him.
Professionally.
Just tell me when to start cracking skulls, kid.
Deep breaths, Adam. They mean well.
Looks like the neighborhood moms are training for the 10K.
Wanna check it out?
ADAM: Once they showed up, they never went away.
Like a bunch of inescapable roommates.
There's Rebecca.
She's sort of Dalai Lama meets Coachella.
Always zen.
Honestly, I don't mind her that much.
Then there's the Bodyguard, which is self-explanatory.
He's temperamental but loyal.
You always gotta watch your back.
And lastly, there's Joaquin.
He's like the horny best friend from a '90s teen movie,
following you around, saying all of your unfiltered thoughts.
I know.
It's a lot.
That's where you come in, now that my mom is on this hopeless quest for a cure.
Just like all the other delusional moms we've met along the way,
sitting in the same waiting rooms, putting their faith in the same doctors,
quietly begging for the same thing:
"Cure my kid."
Abilify. Risperdal.
Clozapine. Stelazine.
Name a drug cocktail and I've tried it.
Any changes at all?
No.
ADAM: Yet, somehow, my mom hasn't given up hope.
That makes one of us. I guess.
So, there you have it.
The whole woeful story.
Take it or leave it.
Or maybe just leave it.
'Cause let's be honest, the only reason we're here
is because my mom's persistence is inescapable.
And I'm not trying to take a giant shit on your life's work or anything,
but I'm part of an elite club they call treatment resistant.
Which means we're probably not gonna have our own "It's not your fault" moment
from Good Will Hunting.
So, why don't you quietly reject me from this experimental trial
and save us both the disappointment?
Cool?
BETH: Okay, sweetheart, time to go.
I told you, I'm not gonna be someone's guinea pig.
We don't know what'll happen if I take that.
You might start feeling better.
You just might start spending a little more time out of bed.
-That's what could happen. -But what if I lose all my hair?
What if I go blind? What if it's poisoned?
Honey, who would want to poison you?
-We're ready. BETH: Okay, we'll be right down.
Come on. I have a really good feeling about this one.
Don't do us dirty, bro.
-Can I just take it later? -Fine.
Get dressed.
We have got to go to Brazil.
This looks like it could be nice.
But I'm not even Catholic.
Catholics are more about attendance anyway.
It's nice to finally meet you, Mr. Petrazelli.
You, too.
[WHISPERS] Take it off.
I'm glad you could all make the drive out here.
Yeah, well, the only person that can't reject you is Jesus, right?
[IN NORMAL VOICE] I think what he means to say is we are
very appreciative that you're considering Adam in the middle of a school year.
Our Lord embraces all children, even those with challenges.
CATHERINE: We make it a point...
Come on, kid. Let me take care of her for you.
It's gonna be nothing but trouble. CATHERINE: We want to give them the tools to...
Suit yourself.
-Is something wrong? ADAM: No.
Just wow. Uh...
Quite the display.
Yes, St. Agatha's is home to the best and the brightest.
Not just in the school district but in all of the county.
And the buck doesn't stop there.
Moral and spiritual integrity are also of paramount importance.
As you know, Adam's admission to such a distinguished academic culture
would be conditional.
These expectations extend to him, regardless of his medical issues.
That won't be a problem.
-Right? Adam? -Yeah, right.
I'm ready to excel on all fronts.
It says here...
that Adam has begun a recent medical trial to help treat his condition.
Yes, he just started.
And how are you feeling?
Uh... all fired up.
Well...
we can accept Adam.
On the condition that he maintain a 3.5 GPA
and score above a 90 percent on the yearly benchmark exam.
Lastly, we would need monthly updates regarding his psychiatric treatment.
That won't be a problem.
Thank you so much.
You'll, um... practice discretion, right?
We had an issue with bullying at his last school.
Perhaps that would be for the best. No need to alarm anyone.
PAUL: Okay, thank you. Adam.
Adam?
I need to go use the restroom.
Just a second.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Don't you see him judging me?
-Who? Paul? -Yeah.
He cares about you. He just doesn't communicate like us.
Really? You call this communicating?
Look, you're gonna feel better once you start taking the medication.
-Subtle topic change-- -No, you heard her.
You've gotta get serious about this trial and about doing well here, otherwise...
Otherwise what?
No diploma.
No culinary school in the fall.
This is your last chance, Adam.
Sweetie, we can treat this.
You remember what the doctor said,
that just because you're a person who's dealing with this illness,
-doesn't mean-- -I'm not the illness itself.
It's hard not to feel like that when everyone treats you like one.
I'll be right back.
Moral and spiritual integrity, my ass.
MAYA: How hard is it to meet me in the bathroom like we talked about?
Not outside, not in the hallway. In. It's a simple concept.
TED: Okay. Get off my nuts. We're in the bathroom.
MAYA: Cash. TED: Yeah.
MAYA: You're short 40. This isn't charity work. TED: I'll get you the rest next month.
MAYA: No, you still owe me 30 from last month.
MAYA: Is he with you?
TED: Nope.
You know this wing is closed for Mass, right?
Her energy is so strong.
I bet she's a Sagittarius.
Are you mute or something?
Scratch that. Definitely a Scorpio.
Not mute.
Um, just new.
Tomorrow's my first day. I didn't realize this wing was closed.
Don't get too excited down there.
You didn't see us, okay?
See who?
-Us. -I need it by next week.
-I'm gonna sew you a cape. MAYA: Shut up.
TED: You are my hero.
DARKNESS: Adam.
DARKNESS: Who are you trying to fool?
You'll never make it here.
Yeah.
Um... I'll see you guys later.
Okay, this is it. Send out the vibe.
Be cool. Be confident. Less like you, more like me.
Keep this prasiolite in your pocket. It'll boost your confidence.
What is that?
It's my lunch.
Who brings their own sushi to school?
Beautiful. She's setting you up for playful banter.
Beats the dog food they serve here.
Food here isn't that terrible.
For the tuition, they should be serving farm-to-table.
So, what, are you some kind of food snob or something?
Tell her you have a big palate.
I have a big... palate.
Okay.
-Hey, right here. ADAM: Yeah.
Hi.
MAYA: Hi. -Yeah.
You're kind of weird.
No offense but are you special needs?
No!
Just a question, man. Didn't mean to get you all triggered.
I mean, uh, no, I'm not. I have this chronic headache syndrome.
So, it makes me blurry sometimes.
-Have you ever got a brain scan for that? -No, why would I?
Well, several malignant tumors mimic the symptoms of a common headache.
Acoustic neuroma, CNS lymphoma, meningioma.
Just saying.
I'm pretty sure they're just headaches.
I'm Maya.
I'm Adam.
I came over here to intimidate you into silence...
but something tells me you're pretty harmless.
Are you the school's drug dealer or something?
You're looking at St. Agatha's projected valedictorian.
Show a little respect.
What's with all the cloak-and-dagger in the boys' bathroom?
It's just side hustle.
I'm the kind of person who knows how to get things done here for a price.
Homework, essays.
So, you're like the Bernie Madoff of academic fraud?
Sure, only I don't get caught.
Why are you dressed for a snowstorm? It's like 80 outside.
I run cold.
Better hope they don't catch you out of your uniform.
Hey, guys. Would you like to sign up for prom tickets?
This year's theme is Starry Night: A Magical Night Under His Stars.
I think she's talking to you.
I choose not to affiliate myself with patriarchal norms like prom.
Um... thank you.
Not bad.
Anyway, um, if you need anything, if you know what I mean, let me know.
Hey, are you guys coming?
Bad idea, kid.
Sure. Good luck getting laid with jaundice and diarrhea.
ADAM: Updates.
I made a new friend. Sort of.
That felt like a win for Adam.
Don't get many of those when your entire waking life
is an escape room with no exit.
Meanwhile, Paul still tiptoes around me like I'm gonna kill him in his sleep.
As if being mentally ill automatically makes you Jeffrey Dahmer.
What are these?
Um, uh, one less utensil we have to wash.
Thought we'd give them a try.
I don't know what's weirder.
Seeing things that aren't actually there
or sitting across from a grown man who is suddenly afraid of me.
So, Adam...
did you learn something new today?
ADAM: But that's his problem, not mine.
I learned that St. Agatha's was named after a woman
who refused a man's advances
and subsequently had her breasts hacked off as penance.
I think Paul was referring to your coursework.
It was fine.
Not much to say.
Just give it time. It's a good school.
Okay.
DARKNESS: Adam.
Adam.
You're ruining your mother's life, Adam. You're not the son she wanted.
This is why your father left. He knew something was wrong with you.
And soon, everyone at your new school will know the truth.
That's when they'll finally get rid of you.
Gone.
Nothing.
When that voice comes to visit me,
it's like I'm having a nightmare while I'm awake.
I try to close my eyes...
and let my mind go blank, like you told me to.
But...
that doesn't work.
-I'm proud of you. -Thanks.
ADAM: And I maintain that this drug won't work either.
Proud of you, honey.
ADAM: But I was secretly hoping you'd prove me wrong.
NUN: Good.
Very good, Marlene.
Adam, this is not good. We have to fix this.
I'm not trying to fail math.
I know that, but you can't get kicked out your second week.
-This is your life we're talking about. -I know.
But you're not in my head with me.
Let's get back on the same team.
Find your center. Take a breath.
Yeah, okay. Same team.
Maybe Paul could help. He's a numbers guy.
No, that's...
-That's gonna be a hard pass from me. BETH: Just think about it, okay?
Okay.
I'll find a tutor.
-Hey. -Why did you sign your name in the note?
I was literally looking at you when you handed it to me.
Kids around here really have a way with words, huh?
Don't let the achievements fool you.
Everything you need to know about St. Agatha's is in here.
-So, this is like the underbelly? -Yeah, and it needs to stay that way.
If we're gonna do business together,
you can't pass notes in front of Sister Catherine.
Well, that's the thing. I don't need you to go all Madoff on me.
I need a tutor.
Yeah, no. I don't do that kind of bitch work. Try the student center.
That kid the other day, he owed you money, right?
You'd be surprised how many of these rich assholes
don't keep up their end of the bargain.
Do you want to keep chasing rich assholes, or do you want to get paid?
My mom is willing to pay for a tutor, and she really wants me to do well.
Two hundred a week, three sessions.
All weekdays, one weekend out of the month.
Jesus.
-Are you serious? -You get what you pay for.
-How about 100 a week? -Two hundred.
-One fifty. -Two or I walk. Yes or no?
After I won the Newton Young Genius Award
from the National Honor Society in seventh grade,
I got a full-ride scholarship to St. Agatha's,
where I've been the reigning student body president
since my freshman year,
in addition to being captain of several clubs.
Yearbook, Science, French, Model United Nations, to name a few.
But those are just for fun.
My primary focus is academics,
as I've received an early acceptance to Duke this fall.
Wow, that--
Wow, very impressive, Maya.
The upright Lovers card. Love, union, mutual attraction.
MAYA: When I do something, I do it all the way.
Middle ground or halfway aren't concepts I subscribe to.
I will do everything in my power to make sure your boy doesn't fall behind.
-She's good. -She is good.
-You don't work with adults, do you? -Um...
You're very impressive, Maya.
Um... but 200 dollars a week is too much. Would you accept 75?
-Yeah, yeah, that's fine. -Really?
BETH: Great!
Pretty impressive dog and pony show down there.
Yeah, well, I invented the dog and pony show.
Oh, it's so quiet out here. You can hear everything.
Totally.
What's with the cookbooks, Julia Child?
Oh. Um, I'm sort of studying to be a chef.
Sort of or are you?
I am.
-That's your thing. -That's my thing.
-You don't hear that every day. -Yeah.
Wow, The Encyclopedia of Cinnamon by Alicia Tella.
What she can do with cinnamon is seriously unreal.
What?
Are you surprised that I've surpassed your level of nerdiness?
Please, you're talking to the captain of Robotics Club.
Oh. Well, um, I can literally make the final dish served on the Titanic.
Oh. You want to go there? All right.
For my eighth-grade science fair, I built a functioning replica of the Mars rover.
Out of soda cans.
Well, for my 16th birthday, I went to a cheese seminar in Oregon.
Last summer, I won the Google Science Talent Search.
You know who handpicked my project? Neil deGrasse Tyson.
No.
Come at me.
All right, I got nothing.
What? Don't look at me. Look at her.
You have a problem with eye contact.
Do you always say exactly what comes into your mind?
I mean, I could have a degenerative eye disease or something.
Yeah, well, it's best to say exactly what you mean or nothing at all.
Unrelenting honesty, you know?
That's useful.
This is a new recipe I'm trying.
Did they teach you this at your Hogwarts for Artisan Cheeses?
-Ha, ha. Just try it. -Are you sure you can handle the truth?
Guess we'll find out.
This is it. Okay, you're on the five-yard line.
Hook, line, sink. He's in.
What's happening?
-Told you not to take the pills. -This is good. Like, really good.
-Yeah, no, I know. -It's like...
...earthy.
Maybe smokey, even.
-That's the Fontina cheese. -My goodness.
-It's my secret weapon. -Can you hear me?
All right, to find the area of the circle, you...
A equals...
-Pi times R. -...pi times R...
squared.
See? I got this.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Hey, guys. It's late.
Maya, how did you get here? I don't see a car.
Yeah, I took the bus.
Okay, let me drive you home.
You don't have to do that. I can catch the last bus.
At this hour? Not a chance. I'll meet you downstairs in ten.
MAYA: Yeah, this is it. Thank you for driving me.
Um... -I'll see you Monday. -I'll see you Monday.
ADAM: Look, I know "cure" is a dangerous word amongst my people,
so I won't say that's what's happening.
Hey. No.
Don't, don't, don't. Adam, think about this. Just don't-- Hey!
Oh, you motherf--
ADAM: But this is the closest I've felt to normal in, well, ever.
No projectile diarrhea or any other punishing side effects.
Just some muscle twitching. No big deal.
It's all good.
I hope it lasts.
Eggs Benedict with well-done bacon.
How you like it.
Good morning to you, too.
The hollandaise sauce has cayenne pepper. Let me know what you think.
-What? -Nothing.
-You seem up lately. -"Up"?
BETH: Happy.
It's a good look.
Yeah, well, you know, I feel good.
-Okay, have some. Come on. -Okay.
-Honey, it's so good. Mm-hm. -Yeah? Really?
He's back!
-Mm. Mm. -Okay.
I'm back.
Hey, what's with the heating pad? Is Paul hemorrhoidal?
-Is his prostate flaring up? -Ahem. God.
-I'm serious. I care about that. -You're terrible!
I'm not terrible. I just care about his spine.
No, I bought it for you.
I thought it might help with your muscle spasms.
Mm. Baby, this is so good.
Wait, did you talk to my psychiatrist?
Now and then. That's the agreement, right?
I didn't think you'd be getting transcripts.
I'm your mom. My job is to help you.
Hi.
Hello?
PATRICK: In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.
It's your turn.
Sorry, I've never done this before. I don't really believe in God.
I probably shouldn't say that.
Don't overthink it.
There are no rules here. It's your time.
Do people really just talk about how much they jerk off and stuff?
Well, everybody in this school is between 13 and 18, so, what do you think?
-Well, that's embarrassing for everyone. -As long as they don't do it in here.
John 1:9.
"If we confess our sins, then he is faithful and just,
and he will purify us of all unrighteousness."
Really? That's your sales pitch?
It usually works.
Well, what if I just sit here?
Then you can search your soul for guidance and I'll enjoy the quiet time.
-So, everything I say stays between us? -And God.
But since you don't believe in God, then I guess it's just us.
I see this psychiatrist,
and apparently, she tells my mom everything.
-And that bothers you? -Yeah.
You wouldn't want your mom reading your diary, right?
No. You're right, that's twisted.
I don't think that...
I should feel like I have someone watching over me all the time.
I feel like I should be able to live my own life. Right?
Now, that is a reasonable request.
You should have the space and autonomy to become the person you're going to be.
Right.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
It's nice to be heard and not just observed.
-It's nice to be listened to. -Yeah.
I absolve you of your sins,
in the name of the Father, the Son, Holy Spirit, amen.
-Oh, I didn't confess anything. -Just go with it.
I'll admit, I was ready to come in here guns blazing
over you telling my mom everything I say in our sessions.
But then something incredible happened.
For the first time in forever,
I woke up the other morning to complete silence.
No whispers.
No banter.
No visions.
Just pure, beautiful, unfiltered quiet.
It's amazing what I've been able to do
with all this extra real estate in my brain.
Oh, you're pleased with my services.
Yeah! What do you think? It's an A-minus. Thank you.
Hmm. Uh, hey, don't rest on your laurels.
You won't get another makeup exam if you shit the bed again.
Right, and that's why I think we should hang out later.
Hang out?
I mean, study.
MAYA: We could've just studied in the library.
ADAM: Yeah, well, the library doesn't serve lobster frittata.
MAYA: You're so weird.
You know, when I first met you, I thought:
"Maybe he's just awkward and unsocialized."
But that's not it. There's something else.
Cool. Thanks.
I don't know what to say to that.
-I'm just me. -I'll crack you, Petrazelli.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
Why does the valedictorian risk it all for a side hustle?
-I like helping people. Big deal. -Uh-huh.
Maybe I'll be the one to crack you.
Why don't you tell me about the restaurant you're taking me to?
Well, basically...
it's my dream kitchen.
I've studied the menu for years.
And nobody invents like they do.
It's the kind of place I'd like to work at.
-Maybe even own, we'll see. -Right, when cheese camp finally pays off?
Hey, you laugh, but cheese camp was a spiritual experience.
And the kitchen is just my place.
When I'm cooking, it's like everything disappears.
And...
I get to be exactly who I want to be.
I'm in control.
I respect that.
You have to choose exactly who you want to be.
Life's too short.
TODD: All right, guys, so, I got my parents' car for the night,
so, whenever you guys are trying to head out, we can.
-I'm trying to head out-- BOY 1: Hey, yo, check it out.
-Oh, look who it is. BOY 2: Oh, man!
[LAUGHING] I feel like such an idiot because-- What?
I made fun of you so hard before, and now I don't know.
I thought your cheese was better than the cheese we had.
-Really? -Look who it is!
ADAM: That's crazy. -Hey, Straitjacket.
MAYA: That's a good testament to you. -Adam! Adam!
-Hey! Come on, man. You know it's us. -Yo, get him.
TODD: You don't have to mess with him.
BOY 2: Oh, yeah!
BOY 3: Got him.
Look at his face.
-Hey! You need to apologize, asshole. BOY 2: Loser.
-Who are you calling "asshole"? -Wow.
Your handler's actually pretty hot, Straitjacket.
Trust me, you don't want to hang out with this psycho, okay?
-Don't touch me. BOY 2: Whoa! Back up, chick!
BOY 3: Dude! BOY 2: Hey! Both of you!
Hey! Stop! Stop! Let it go, all right?
BOY 1: Losers!
-What the...? ADAM: It's okay.
-Who was that? Adam, who--? ADAM: I don't know. I don't know.
Hey, I'm sorry about that.
Do you want to tell me what that was about?
Um, there's nothing really to tell.
You know, I was thinking, isn't it--?
Isn't it a little weird that you left your high school
in the middle of senior year
to go to a Catholic school outside of your district?
Yeah. Uh...
It was a-- It was a fight.
I got into a fight with one of those guys.
-You were fighting? ADAM: Yeah, and it was really bad.
So, I tried to put it behind me.
That's all you're gonna give me?
MAN: Don't let them take you there.
No, I want to stay here. I want to stay right here on this surface. Mm-hm.
Don't let them take you there. Don't...
No. I won't go. I won't go.
Don't let them take you. It's not good there.
Don't, don't, don't.
Ted, thanks for coming early for once.
Ted, my office now.
Maya, you stay here.
How long has this been going on?
Sister Catherine, I'm-- I'm sorry, I--
How long?
Just a couple months. Not long.
Seems you and I need to have a long conversation about your future.
CATHERINE: Okay, everyone, bring your eyes to the board, please.
The state benchmark exam is in just two weeks.
Here's your essay question.
"Recount a time when you faced failure.
How did it affect you
and what did you learn from the experience?"
As you know, no outlines or scratch paper is allowed.
But, please, start thinking about what you will write.
CATHERINE: All right, everyone, see you tomorrow.
ADAM: Hey!
-Hey. Hey. -Hey. Hey.
Are we still good for tonight? MAYA: Um...
I have a, uh... um...
A club thing after school.
-Can I just--? I'll text you later, okay? -Sure.
Come hungry.
ADAM: She never showed up.
And now that my hallucinations are MIA,
everything is so quiet.
Too quiet.
PATRICK: In the name of the Father, the Son, Holy Spirit, amen.
-Yeah, it's me. -Hello, me.
I need some guidance.
Spiritual guidance?
Uh, not really. It's about a girl.
Okay.
Well, we've been hanging out for a while and it was going great,
and then she randomly stopped talking to me.
-I believe the kids call that ghosting. ADAM: Yeah, whatever.
I'm just worried that maybe she found some things out about me,
like the psychiatrist I was telling you about.
Which I can't imagine is the sexiest thing in the world.
-What do you think? PATRICK: Have you tried praying on it?
No. No offense but I need some real-life advice.
Timothy 1:7.
"God does not give us the spirit of cowardice
but rather the spirit of power and of love."
Okay, but is there anything else that you've got?
I don't know the details of your life, but you seem quite all right.
-You're a little squirrely, maybe. -"Squirrely"?
PATRICK: Squirrely. Yeah.
And the truth is, the older you get, the more difficult it is to stay sane.
And it's gonna take real work.
But maybe that's what makes you more mature than others.
And I hear that girls like that sort of thing.
So, you're saying I should confront her? I should tell her how I feel?
Your words, not mine.
Noncommittal till the bitter end. Thank you.
Go in peace.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Maya.
Oh. There's no one here by that name.
Are you sure about that?
Ha, ha. Yeah. I'm sure.
Do you know a Maya Arnaz?
The only Arnaz I know is the guy who works on my roof. Manuel Arnaz?
-Everything okay? -Yeah.
Do you know where I could find him?
MAN: I'm coming.
Yeah, what can I do for you?
-Uh, I'm looking for Maya. -Okay.
I'm-- I'm Adam.
We're supposed to study tonight. Is she home?
She doesn't get off work for another half an hour.
-But you can come in and wait if you like. -No, that's okay. But thank you.
-No, no, come on in. Don't be shy. -Okay.
You from one of those clubs? I can't keep track of them.
-Sorry about the mess. -Oh, no. Don't be.
I've been on these crutches for months. This is Ricky and Danny.
Boys, this is, uh--
-Adam. -Say hi to Adam.
-Hey, guys. BOYS: Hey.
Don't worry about them. They're shy.
-Not like their sister, but you know that. -Right.
Can I get you something to drink? Something to eat?
Oh, um, I'm good.
You sure? We've got TV dinners...
and TV dinners.
Yeah, no, I'm all good. Thanks.
BOTH: We want TV dinners.
They have spoken. Ha, ha.
Oh, shoot!
ADAM: I can put those in for you. -You sure? You don't mind?
ADAM: No problem. -Oh, thanks. That'd be a great help.
Two minutes each, I think. Check the box.
Arnaz Roofing. Hi, Mrs. Jenkins.
Having trouble with your gutters again? Yeah, I'm still on medical leave, so...
Yeah, I can refer you to Galloway. Yeah, he's a great guy.
Mm-hm. Yeah, Bill will take care of you.
ADAM: Yeah, yeah, so, the secret is to marinate the chicken for flavor.
MANUEL: Okay. ADAM: Olive oil, chopped garlic, salt, pepper.
And then you brush a little butter over the top.
MANUEL: That's it? ADAM: That's it.
-Hey. DANNY: I can eat all of it.
-Here you go. -Oh, look at this.
RICKY: Thanks, Adam.
ADAM: Yeah, no problem. -Come on in.
Look at the spread your friend whipped up.
MAYA: Hey. -Hey.
It's awesome.
Hey, Adam, what are you doing here?
Oh, we had a study session, remember?
Right.
-This is amazing. -Yeah? Good.
MANUEL: You never know what's hiding in your fridge.
This guy will be coming at you.
-How'd you get so good in the kitchen? -I've been cooking my whole life.
One day, hopefully, I'll own my own restaurant.
Wow. You have to go to school for that?
-Yeah, Dad, it's culinary art school. MANUEL: Oh.
Yeah. Right, right.
If you're gonna spend your whole life working,
might as well make it something you enjoy, right?
I always try to tell Maya that.
She'll be the first Arnaz to get her college degree.
Her mother would have been so proud. She was a smart lady, too.
-Dad. -What?
Let me brag about my daughter.
Well, one day, my little girl here, she's gonna pick me up in a Porsche.
-She's been saying that since she was 10. -Sorry, excuse me.
-Why did you do this? -I didn't mean to upset you, honestly.
I went to the other house. The lady sent me here.
So, you decided to make yourself at home by cooking dinner?
I thought it'd be nice.
You did it because it was nice or because you felt sorry for us?
I wouldn't-- No. I don't feel sorry for you.
Are you satisfied, then?
Good job. You found our tiny house in a run-down neighborhood
so you could cook us poor people dinner. You're a real saint.
I'm sorry.
Sister Catherine caught me.
Side hustle's dead, and I'm not making enough money tutoring you.
This restaurant pays me under the table.
And it's good.
My family depends on me.
The only reason I'm getting a second chance
is 'cause I'm valedictorian.
You have no idea how hard I worked to get here.
I can't lose it all now.
No.
You're not gonna lose anything.
You're like a robot.
Immune to human error.
And my schedule is wide open, you know.
So, we can meet whenever.
There are other tutors out there. You know that, right?
None like you.
I like knowing I get to see you three times a week.
A Brief History of Time. Pale Blue Dot.
And then would this be your favorite movie?
Do I, uh, detect a hint of smugness in your voice?
Not at all.
I actually really love this one.
-It's a classic. You know that, right? -It's a cinematic masterpiece.
Thank you for cooking.
Sure.
Don't forget to show your work when doing the sine ratio, okay?
Okay.
Otherwise...
looks good.
Great work.
Watch out. I may be coming for your academic throne.
Never. Um...
But I do have a surprise for you since you've been killing it lately.
You can thank my dad.
He fixed the roof last winter, so, he's pretty tight with the owner.
Oh, man.
Are these the MAC MH-90s?
I don't know.
This grill's insane.
I don't know about you, but I'm pretty hungry.
So, you don't follow a recipe?
Everyone thinks cooking is about following instructions,
but it's the opposite.
Your palate will tell you exactly what the dish wants.
So, we need to talk about benchmark exams next week.
Right. Why is everyone so obsessed with those here? Are they really hard?
I mean, no, they're not so much hard
as they are a means to keep the school funded.
Plus, the top three are read at graduation,
so, you know, St. Agatha kids, they live for that crap.
You know, I was, um, thinking that...
maybe you could write about what happened at your old school.
I mean, if you see it as a failure.
-I see what you're doing. -What?
You're digging for more answers.
MAYA: I'm digging for more answers?
You showed up at my house. You basically stalked me.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
Okay, okay.
Okay. Um...
I guess, uh, in the beginning...
I try not to see it as a failure, but it's hard not to.
After the fight...
people immediately looked at me differently.
Like they were afraid of me.
No matter what I did, I couldn't get them to see me
as they did before.
But I let that happen.
I became a bystander in my own life.
I guess that's what felt like the real failure.
Hey.
I think we found your essay.
What?
Ahem. Mm-mm. It's good. It's very good.
What happened to unrelenting honesty?
I'm sorry. I know you worked really hard on that.
What's wrong with it?
I think you just added a little bit too much spice or something.
It tastes fine to me.
CATHERINE: All of your belongings should be under your desk.
Out of sight. No exceptions.
The only materials I should see
are the Scantron, a number two pencil, your calculator, and the test booklet.
[IN DISTORTED VOICE] Absolutely nothing else should be visible.
You will have 60 minutes for the mathematics portion
and 90 minutes for the essay question.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Begin.
BETH: You're not that hungry?
Oh, no, I, um...
It's your favorite.
-Yeah. -Paul picked it up from Vince's.
-Yeah. Thanks, Paul. -You're welcome.
Actually, we have something we need to talk to you about.
And I want you to know that everything is gonna be okay.
Okay?
Did somebody die?
No, nobody's dying.
No, everybody's okay. Everybody's alive.
I'm pregnant.
And we're gonna have a baby.
Like, a human baby?
Jeez, I hope so.
Look, we didn't plan this at all.
[IN ECHOING VOICE] And we're just getting our heads around this now.
Adam?
Adam?
-[IN NORMAL VOICE] Adam. -You okay, buddy?
Yeah.
Yeah, congratulations.
Okay, all right, I'm gonna go to the office,
get ready for tomorrow's work.
Uh, if anybody needs me...
Adam. Look at me.
I promise nothing is going to change.
What are you talking about?
Everything will.
[IN ECHOING VOICE] No, I mean between you and I.
Look, I know this isn't the right time.
And I'm scared, too, believe me, but it's also...
ADAM: Okay, I was reading the pamphlet you gave me
about the potential side effects of this drug.
Dehydration, sweating, trouble urinating,
vision loss, muscle tension,
loss of taste and hearing, tremors.
Oh, and my personal favorite,
anal leakage.
You can go ahead and cross most of those off the list.
I can't cook anymore, because my taste comes and goes.
I can barely piss straight, because my hand has a mind of its own.
But I swear,
if anything drips out of my ass, please just kill me.
Morning.
-Have a good day. -You, too.
I love you.
Have a good day, hon.
Have a good day, honey.
Someone should really keep an eye on that kid.
Good morning.
Morning, boss.
Yeah, yeah, we missed you.
Um, okay, we're starting at chapter five, I think.
-Five. -It's page 403.
-Oh, I'm on that. -Do you have it?
-Yeah. -Okay.
Um, all right. Ahem.
"Angles in X-Y coordinate system.
Angles formed by rotating ray or a half-line about its endpoint,
the initial side of the angle, starting position of the ray.
Final position of the ray rotation." Did you get that?
DARKNESS: Adam.
DARKNESS: Adam.
You thought you could get rid of me.
You feel that?
I'm still here.
You don't know that. I just know.
DARKNESS: Don't fight it, Adam.
Adam.
Adam.
DARKNESS: Adam!
You need to go home now.
Adam, what do you think?
Um... Sorry. I'm-- I'm not feeling so good.
Hey. Hey, Adam. Hey, hey, what's wrong?
What'd I say, huh? Get out of here!
I gotta go. I gotta go. They're gonna take me and I gotta go.
-Take you where? What are you--? -I can't keep her safe, too.
-Adam. -Stop!
Just leave me alone and don't follow me.
VOICE 1 [WHISPERING]: Adam.
VOICE 2 [WHISPERING]: Over here.
VOICE 1: Hey.
VOICE 1: Adam.
VOICE 2: Look over here. VOICE 3 [WHISPERING]: That's it.
VOICE 2: It's real.
VOICE 3: Good boy, Adam.
VOICE 2: She never wanted you. She never wanted you.
She doesn't love you.
VOICE 1: He hates you.
DARKNESS: This is the kid she always wanted.
The one that'll make up for her biggest mistake.
You.
Everything all right?
-Were you watching me? -No.
I was just heading to bed.
Everything okay?
Sister Catherine called.
She expressed some concerns about your behavior this week.
Having a kid with my mom doesn't make you my dad.
Adam, I'm not going anywhere.
Yeah, clearly.
When I was a freshman,
there was this girl at our school who was a junior,
and she was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer.
She was a part of Make-A-Wish Foundation, so, before she died,
they had some boy band come to our school
and have lunch with her as part of her wish.
It was a really touching thing.
It was all people could talk about for weeks.
But it got me thinking.
When you're a cancer kid,
people can't wait to flock to your aid
and are so eager to grant any wish you have before you die.
But when you have schizophrenia,
people can't wait to make you someone else's problem.
That's why we end up on the streets, screaming at nothing,
waiting to die.
No one wants to grant our wishes.
Hey.
I'm sorry about the other day.
I just wasn't feeling good.
I'm sorry.
Are you sure that it's just headaches?
I'm worried about you.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Let me make it up to you.
Please.
GIRL: She won't let me go out or anything.
No way.
Way.
-You didn't. -I did.
You know, usually, this stuff doesn't impress me, but, um, this is... pretty smooth.
but, um, this is... pretty smooth.
JOSIE [ON-SCREEN]: Thank you.
Um, may I have five minutes on the clock, please?
JOAQUIN: Okay, kid. We both know this part of the movie
is the ultimate panty dropper.
Better make your move.
Hey, just take your time.
No rush.
WOMAN [ON-SCREEN]: That is so wrong.
DARKNESS: Adam. VOICE 1 [WHISPERING]: Adam.
DARKNESS: Hey, over here. VOICE 2 [WHISPERING]: Adam. Adam. Adam.
DARKNESS: Adam.
-Adam. VOICE 2: Adam.
That's not good.
Finally!
-No way. What is going on with you? -Nothing. I'm fine.
No, you're not fine.
You don't even look like you're on this planet half the time.
Adam, look, you can trust her.
No, you're right. There is something.
Yeah. Yeah, just show her who you are. Tell her about us.
Don't do that.
There's been a lot going on at home lately.
I've been feeling really alone.
I'm sorry.
But I don't feel that way when I'm with you.
Oh, yeah.
So...
I wanted...
I want to know if you'd want to go to prom with me?
I know it's an extension of the patriarchy and everything...
but would you?
Only if you tell people that I asked you.
-Deal. -Deal.
ADAM: My mom told me something once when she first started dating again.
You lose your secrets when you let people get too close.
It can be painful
to let someone find you in all the dark and twisty places inside.
But you have to hope they do...
because that's the beginning of everything.
But letting Maya love me the way that I am
would be like letting her catch a disease.
She doesn't deserve to be loved by someone
who can't see the world the way it is.
Right?
And I'd really like to keep my secrets while I have them.
You want to explain these?
What do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you haven't stopped taking your medication behind my back.
I can't say that.
Do you have any idea how much we have on the line with this school?
With your medical expenses?
What about me?
What about what I need?
What are you talking about? It's all about you.
It's all about you all the time. All of this is for you.
The books and the articles
and the staying up all night reading forum after forum.
Do you think you're the only one in this house going through this?
That's what they tell you in those parenting books?
Oh, my God!
You know, you are not the only person in this house who is affected by this.
Do you think that this is the life that I wanted for you?
For myself?
Okay.
I'm sorry for getting in the way of you and Paul and the new baby
and your perfect new life
that doesn't include a crazy stepson who hears voices.
Stop. Adam.
Adam. Stop.
Listen to me.
I know that you must be scared and that it's lonely in your head.
And I wish I could be in there with you.
I wish I could ease that burden, but I can't.
I'm trying. I am really trying.
And I would do anything for you. Just tell me what to do. Tell me.
Tell me how to help you.
There's nothing you can do.
The pills make me feel like I want to die.
I can't see. I can't think. And I can't cook.
And what's the point if I can't cook?
Why didn't you share that with me? We're in this together.
We're supposed to be on the same team, remember?
We're not on the same team.
And we haven't been since Paul moved in.
BETH: I can't do that to him. PAUL: I understand that.
Just listen to me. We have to do something.
BETH: I know that, Paul. PAUL: It's only a matter of time--
BETH: I'm doing everything I can. PAUL: Do you see him?
-Do you see what's going on? BETH: Of course I see him. I see everything.
-I'm his mother. PAUL: I'm just trying to avert a disaster.
-We ain't taking no damn pills, you hear? JOAQUIN: You didn't need those pills.
-We gotta get him out of here. -Screw pills!
Okay.
You're awesome. We're here for you and we believe in you.
We ain't gonna let them take us out of here!
-This is our house! Ours! -This bed is really comfy.
Sorry. You startled me.
DARKNESS: You're trash.
What?
Could you throw away your trash?
Sure.
You know, uh...
I was really starting to look forward to our Good Will Hunting moment.
TEACHER: When you're finished with the questions, please pass them forward
and open up your textbooks to chapter 18.
CATHERINE [OVER PA]: Adam Petrazelli, please report to the principal's office.
Adam, please, take a seat.
ADAM: Mom, what's going on? -It's okay.
It has been brought to my attention that you are no longer taking your medication.
Yeah, okay, it--
It made me worse.
As I said from day one,
your admission to St. Agatha's is conditional.
We can't take any risks.
What does that mean? Risks?
They're afraid you're gonna hurt other students, Adam.
Are you kicking me out?
-Suspending you. BETH: Temporarily.
Just-- Just until we figure things out.
You may finish out the day to avoid causing a scene.
It was you.
I saw you writing that e-mail to her. I know you want to send me away.
-Adam, you need to calm down. -No one wants to send you away.
Yes, he does, and he's a liar.
This was my last chance.
I probably won't get another one.
Remember, Mom?
MAYA: Are you surprised?
What? Why?
It's actually nice to have some competition around here for once.
-What are you talking about? -Come on. Let's go.
MAYA: I'm proud of you, Petrazelli.
Aren't you supposed to be in class?
I didn't feel like it.
You want to hop in the box and talk about it?
What I'm dealing with can't be fixed, Father.
Try me.
What is even the purpose of all this?
Confession?
You think making people feel like shit somehow brings out the best in them.
Cool philosophy.
"Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper,
but the one that confesses and renounces them--"
That's great.
Another fortune-cookie answer.
You have a list that you alternate?
Maybe.
Being ambiguous...
doesn't make you profound.
It makes you full of shit.
DARKNESS: Here's something profound for you.
Why don't you kill yourself?
ADAM: What?
I said, why don't you excuse yourself? Take a day off. Leave yourself alone.
That's not what you said.
-This is bullshit. -Hey, don't talk to your mother like that.
Thanks for the parenting advice, Paul.
What makes you think you could go to prom? You're suspended.
This is insane!
Hey, let's just sit down, okay?
DARKNESS: You're trapped.
I'm trapped. This is how it starts.
DARKNESS: This is how they do it. -This is how you do it.
First, it's the pills.
The pills make me feel like shit, so, I come off of them.
And that's when Paul convinces you to send me somewhere.
-Shh. -Because nothing else works!
Nothing else works!
DARKNESS: Because nothing was designed to work.
Nothing was designed to work! That was the plan.
-I was right. I was right the whole time. PAUL: That wasn't the plan.
-That wasn't the plan, Adam. -Shut up, Paul!
You poisoned my brain!
BETH: Hey. ADAM: You know he did that, Mom.
-Can you see that? -Adam.
-Mom, can you see that? -Come on. Come on.
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.
Listen to my voice.
My voice is the only one that matters right now, okay?
And I am telling you that you are my entire world, okay?
Adam.
Come on, kid. Don't you see it's all a big bait and switch?
Adam.
You better get out of here before it's too late.
BETH: Adam.
I don't believe you.
DARKNESS: Oh, Adam, Adam, Adam.
What are you doing?
No...
Please.
DARKNESS: You're really gonna go to prom unprepared?
DARKNESS: That's it.
How else will you survive the night?
Take all the pills.
Do it. Do it.
What are you staring at?
I just thought you didn't really care about dances.
Well, I don't do anything halfway, so...
Clearly.
I'll, um, try not to pierce your nipple.
Why are you sweating? Did you run here?
MAYA: Yeah? No? -No, no, no.
No, it's just really hot out. Do you want this?
MAYA: Yeah. -Okay.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah. You want to go inside?
Okay.
Oh, wow, that was bright.
-Wanna go? -Yeah.
Yeah. Do you want some punch?
Sorry.
CATHERINE [IN DISTORTED VOICE]: Excuse me, Mr. Petrazelli.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] What part of "suspended" do you not understand?
Young man, I'm talking to you.
Where are you going?
-Mr. Petrazelli! DARKNESS: Adam.
-Hey. Hey, let's go dance. Come on. -Oh, okay. ♪ In the town full of fancy cars ♪
Adam?
-Adam? -Excuse me.
You can't just walk away from me.
-You have to leave this prom right now. -What's going on?
We discussed this, Mr. Petrazelli.
You don't have permission to be here.
[IN DISTORTED VOICE] You are leaving the prom right now.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You are suspended.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Adam!
[IN DISTORTED VOICE] Adam!
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Adam!
Stay with us, buddy. Stay--
Adam, look at me. Adam! Look at me quick. Eyes open. Pupils are 9.4.
Adam, you're okay. You're safe. Adam, Adam, Adam.
-Slow down. You're all right. You're okay. EMT: Breathe. Breathe.
Hey.
What's going on? Where's Maya?
Is she okay?
She's, uh-- She's worried about you.
We all are.
Does she know?
I told her, honey.
No, no, no.
No.
No.
What is this?
-Adam. -What's going on?
-That's just for your own safety. -Shut up, Paul. Shut up.
-Shh. It's just temporary. -Where am I?
Listen, you were upset.
And we didn't want you to hurt yourself.
Okay, when can I go home?
You have to get better first.
You wanted to put me here,
in a place where they could fix me professionally.
It's not how I meant it, Adam.
Hi.
Can you please make her leave?
Adam.
Oh, I'm ready, boss.
-All you gotta do is say the word. -Stop!
Don't move.
Adam, listen to me.
She can accept all of you.
Okay, please, everyone be quiet.
This is it.
This is what it means to let someone find you
in all the dark and twisty places inside.
Shut up!
No, this can be the beginning of everything, remember?
Shut up! Shut up!
Are you happy?
This is who I am.
It's my big secret, okay?
No, this isn't who you are.
Yes, it is!
I am crazy and I'm dangerous.
And I'm--
I need you to leave.
No.
Do I look like I need a fucking tutor?
Find some other way to keep the lights on!
Make her leave.
-Please. Everyone get out! BETH: Okay.
Don't touch me.
This is Seroquel.
Yeah, I tried that one. ♪ You probably think You're going to heaven ♪
PATRICK: Good morning.
You see him, right?
Yeah, he's real.
Group session in four minutes.
Okay.
What are you doing here?
I'm on my way to the graduation ceremony. I just wanted to see how you were doing.
ADAM: I've had better days.
Are you even allowed to be fraternizing with someone like me?
You know I got expelled, right?
The only agenda I serve is God's.
Could you tell him to maybe reconsider his agenda?
'Cause it feels like I'm getting the short end of the stick.
I'll put in a call.
You mind if I sit?
Go ahead.
Joking aside, I want to talk to you about the question you asked me the other day.
-About the point of confession. -Okay.
Sometimes kids come to see me and they want to know what it all means.
And I usually quote the Bible, allowing them to attach their own meaning.
Trust me, I know.
But sometimes a kid needs more.
Actually telling somebody our sins
gives us an opportunity to admit that we are flawed.
-You don't think we know we're flawed? PATRICK: Everyone's flawed.
But admitting our flaws...
that gives us the opportunity and the strength to face them.
And that's why we confess.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you all this before everything happened.
But I had no idea what you were up against.
Sure.
-You want to pray with me before I go? -What if I still don't believe in God?
Then I will pray, but you need to take the time to think about
what kind of person you want to be.
At the very least, you need to believe in yourself.
Dear Father in heaven,
please watch over Adam on his road to recovery.
-Hi. -I'm gonna wait downstairs.
BETH: Okay.
They said you haven't been eating much,
so, I thought you might want something fresh.
They made me take all the skewers out. It looked a lot better in the store.
No, thanks.
How are you doing?
How do I look?
This is temporary.
No diploma.
No culinary school.
It's over.
This is my life now.
That's not true.
You used to tell me to see myself as a person dealing with an illness...
but not become the illness itself.
But look at me.
I am looking at you.
I see my son...
who I love more than anything.
You want to go get something to eat downstairs?
No, I'm okay, but thank you.
See you later.
ADAM: Okay.
PAUL: Dear Sister Catherine,
I met Adam a little over a year ago.
I don't have much experience with kids,
but knowing Adam has taught me that being a parent
means becoming what your children need most.
Every step of the treatment has been reported.
Not because we were required to do so,
but because it is in Adam's best interest to have the adults in his life
be as informed as possible.
Your threat to expel him is abusive, and we will not tolerate it.
Right now, my son needs me to protect him from narrow-minded people
motivated by fear.
I have faith that you will make a decision
that reflects the moral and spiritual integrity
-St. Agatha's is built upon. -Paul.
Paul. Paul.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I know you didn't sign up for this.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not trying to replace your dad.
No, I know.
He was an asshole anyway.
I need you to take me somewhere.
What? Where?
There is no cure, and maybe one day there will be,
but right now, I gotta work this out on my own terms.
And I can't do that here.
Please, Mom, be with me...
on the same team.
Okay.
Okay.
-Okay. -Okay.
-I'll go sign him out. -Okay.
Okay. Okay.
-Okay. -Thank you.
GIRL: "That was when time stood still.
A moment that came to define that chapter of my adolescence.
And as I stood there with my feet touching the cold waters of Lake Owano,
I knew I could never go back again."
Thank you.
Let's have another round of applause for our benchmark exam finalists.
Without further ado, may I present
St. Agatha's graduating class of 2020.
Jordan Adler.
Congratulations.
Lisa Alliser.
Monica Atkinson.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
I'm graduating.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but there's one other essay that's been scheduled to be read.
Okay, that was a bold move.
DARKNESS: Adam.
Adam.
[IN ECHOING VOICE] They know--
You're not telling them anything.
ADAM [WHISPERS]: Okay.
DARKNESS: Nothing...
Adam.
No.
Hi.
I'm Adam.
-I'm here because... DARKNESS: Don't.
...I need my diploma.
-Without it... DARKNESS: Please, Adam.
...I can't be the person I want to be.
DARKNESS: Shut up. VOICE: Don't do it, Adam!
DARKNESS: Don't. VOICE: Adam!
And that's because I have schizophrenia.
DARKNESS [IN DISTANCE]: You're ruining your mother's life, Adam.
It's a chemical disorder...
DARKNESS: This is why your father left. -...in the brain.
And it makes you hear voices and see things that aren't there.
It sucks.
DARKNESS: They're terrified of you. -You could just Google it.
DARKNESS: Everyone will always be terrified of you.
I have people in my life who have been trying to help me.
People who see me as more than an illness.
But I pushed them away.
I tried chasing this idea of...
being normal.
Whatever that means.
Don't want to end up on the bathroom walls, right?
DARKNESS: He's still a person.
The benchmark exam asked us
to write about our greatest failure.
And I wish that I could read my essay right now,
but it was based on a lie.
My greatest failure, hands down,
has been hiding from the ones I love.
For believing the voice in my head when it tells me...
I'm ruining their lives.
For believing it when it tells me
I'm too defective to be loved by anyone.
You made me feel so many things.
And I wasn't ready to give that up.
I'm sorry you had to expel me
because I didn't fit your picture of normalcy.
But this is who I am.
This is who I am.
I'm Adam.
I have an illness, but I'm not the illness itself.
Okay.
Thank you.
Adam!
-Hey, I'm sorry about the hospital. -No, I don't care about the hospital.
I was just in a bad place. You have every right to hate me.
-If you don't want to talk to me-- -I don't hate you. Stop.
Is that why you didn't tell me?
Because you thought that I was gonna leave?
Hey.
Right here.
-No. I'm just-- MAYA: Then I don't under--
I'm always gonna see things and hear things that I shouldn't.
And the drugs aren't always gonna work.
And I'm sorry, but I can't put you through that.
I'm sorry.
Hey. Hey. Hey.
What makes you think you get to make that decision on your own?
I wasn't mad about the hospital or that you lied to me.
ADAM: Then why?
You didn't let me choose.
You didn't give me a chance to stay.
Would you have?
I love you.
Hey, there's never been a more explicit cue to kiss the girl.
Okay.
yes, yes, yes!
ADAM: Am I gonna sit here and tell you
that things like love and honesty can cure crazy?
No. But they sure can help.
For example, my graduation speech earned St. Agatha's enough shitty PR
for them to give me my diploma.
That felt like a win for honesty.
And as for love,
my mom was right.
BETH: Tiny little fingers.
ADAM: You have to let people discover all your dark and twisty places inside.
She looks like you a little bit.
These big cheeks.
See these cheeks? You had cheeks like that.
VOICE 1 [WHISPERING]: Here we are.
Always be there.
VOICE 2 [WHISPERING] Adam, come over here.
ADAM: Because those are the people that can show you what's real
when you can't see that for yourself.
It can be the beginning of everything...
Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar,
better known as the Magi.
Please! Nobody ever saw them do any magic, as far as I know.
They only get out of here when it’s manger time,
which is pretty soon.
I am Matías, “good old Mat,”
and I’m hiding because it is December 7, 2019,
Little Candles Day, when Christmas officially begins,
the family I live with goes crazy,
and I have a hard time dealing with Bogotá’s madness.
I’m an easygoing cat from the Caribbean, unlike the Morales Bocanegra family.
And this guy is Juan Morales, the family’s dad.
An insurance agent, who, like Melchior, Caspar, and Balthazar,
does magic in his spare time.
Believe it or not, right now, this guy is going all in.
He will have the weirdest Christmas the Morales family ever had.
I got this. Don’t worry.
Where is everybody?
Our beautiful, happy accountants?
Good morning. Especially to you, Mr. Londoño.
We want to welcome you and tell you how very glad we are
We want to welcome you and tell you how very glad we are that you’re now the company’s majority shareholder.
Okay, let’s get started.
You guys are about to experience some tropical magic.
The power of the mind.
I’m going to turn inanimate matter into organic matter.
This is obviously just a regular stapler.
But thanks to the powers I’ve acquired directly from the Magi,
it will turn…
into a bunny!
Please be silent and focus. The artist’s life is in danger.
Weird bunny, right? It looks like a stapler.
Yet it’s a bunny.
What’s the stapler’s name?
-Joselín! Come back! -What a jerk!
Stop that bunny! Don’t let it escape!
Joselín! You’ll get lost!
Come get your carrot! Joselín! You impossible bunny!
-No bunny? -No, sir. I can’t find it.
I searched up to the fourth floor, even the fifth floor.
This place or the audience must have scared it away.
Or maybe it’s just a shy bunny.
Sorry about that. I tried to lighten things up.
No problem.
That’s quite all right, sir. I should apologize to you.
I don’t know what went wrong. I totally mastered that trick.
Why, oh why?
I’m sorry. I apologize, sir.
Allow me to introduce myself. I’m Juan Morales.
I’ve been in Accounting for ten years,
but… actually…
A magician?
Just an amateur for now,
but I am eager to make it in the big leagues.
How interesting.
Yes. Forgive the impudence, sir, but I leave on vacation today,
and who knows when we’ll meet again.
I know you own some hotels in Vegas, so I thought--
Do you know what I miss the most, living abroad?
Christmas.
Really?
When I was a kid, we lived in a very small house.
We were very poor.
But in December, everything changed.
But in December, everything changed. Things became brighter.
Christmas is really…
I really enjoyed the novenas,
the manger, the Christmas carols,
the custard, the fritters.
All the simple things my mom used to help us cope with poverty.
You have no idea how much I miss those moments.
That guy is coming to pray the novena with us?
And we need it to be the best typical family novena,
and not just in the world, in the universe!
The poor guy looked so sad.
The memories of his childhood hit him really hard.
I saw my chance to ask him over, and against all odds, he said yes.
Is the guy really loaded, Dad?
Watch the lights! We have no more.
-We need to check them. -Yes, he’s really loaded.
The guy’s so filthy rich,
the bank calls him every week asking to withdraw cash.
-The vault gets full. -No way!
The best part is, he owns hotels in Vegas.
And we had a chat.
He doesn’t rule out the idea of giving me a job in Las Vegas.
-What? -Yes.
-As a magician? -Yes.
Go all the way to Vegas to be a CPA?
You’re much better as a CPA, Dad.
-Mónica! -You saw him!
Because of a lack of opportunities.
-True. -But guess what I feel.
My ship’s coming in. I don’t feel it. I know it.
It’s my time to shine. Know what?
We’re going to dazzle him this evening.
And we’re going straight to Vegas to work there.
You’re dressed just right for Vegas.
-And me? -You’d look great in a poster.
We’ll work in the entertainment capital of the world
a couple of years and make some money.
-We’ll be millionaires. -Not yet.
We’ll make enough to set up a family business,
and then, straight to the top in the big leagues.
-A candle. -A candle, Margot.
It’s Christmas. There must be one.
-There! -A candle. Calm down.
Get the candle, Mónica. Let us pray.
Let’s ask the Immaculate Conception to grant us this wish.
To make my dream of becoming a magician
and giving my family a better future come true.
Please, pray with a lot of faith.
Hi there, you fools. How’s my beloved family?
-Sammy. What are you doing here? -My baby!
Why didn’t you tell us?
So I could tell you myself. It’s a surprise.
What’s with the weird accent?
Dad, remember when this weirdo came back from his school trip to Mexico?
What’s up, homies? All good, yeah?
Or Spain, where he met Grandma’s lover?
Gosh, dude. Spain is the dog’s bollocks.
-Or when-- -Got it.
Tell us what yourself?
-Want to know? Listen up. -Yes!
I dropped out of the Argentine music school.
I fell for this hot Colombian chick. She’s wild, Dad!
She’s back in Colombia, and I want to marry her.
Good for you, little brother.
Speaking of which, I got a new guy too.
-What? -What?
His name is Destroyer.
Yes, Mom, but his dad is loaded, and he wants to meet you guys.
-My mom! -Destroyer?
She’ll tell us she got a new boyfriend too.
Be quiet.
Mom. Hello. Mom.
I’m in Colombia.
Why didn’t you say you were coming?
Why? Because I wanted to surprise you.
I’m with my fiancé who’s on a business trip.
-Where are you? -At a hotel.
Can I stay with you guys for a few days?
-Is that a problem? -No, this is your home too.
Does your dumb husband think so too?
-What? -Mom’s coming to stay with us.
Here?
Hi. I’m here. We need to talk.
For Pete’s sake! Why didn’t you tell me you were here?
I’d fix a little something for you.
Why not? Because…
the less we’re seen, the better.
-We need to keep a low profile. -Sorry. You’re right.
I’ll be on the coast.
I’ll call you when I get back to discuss the future.
Dad, just tell me where and when, and I’ll be there.
You know I love you.
-Buddy. -Hello? Dad?
Brigitte, come here!
Is your dad here?
Yes. He wants to discuss the future. The future, Brigitte!
Come here. Close your eyes.
Let’s ask the Immaculate Conception to make Baby Jesus grant me
Let’s ask the Immaculate Conception to make Baby Jesus grant me my wish of showing my dad
my wish of showing my dad that I’m not the moron he thinks I am.
Let me help you, Heriberto.
-Close your eyes. -Okay.
Don’t you celebrate the holidays, Lieutenant?
I find them boring and annoying.
Don’t you have anyone to share them with?
Don’t you have a lady neighbor, an ex, a lover, anybody?
An ugly cousin or something?
I was born and raised an only child. And I’ll be shot to death.
Orduz the Corrupt is in town.
We think he’s here for the holidays to meet his partners
and set up a huge money-laundering scheme.
We have no idea who he is or what he looks like.
But guess what.
They’re giving you guys the job.
Thanks.
Do you see, Lieutenant?
This is your big break to catch the Corrupt.
Your perfect chance to get your promotion. Here.
Ask the Immaculate Conception for that miracle.
I’m also an atheist.
Right, I wondered…
if you weren’t… a religious person.
-Mónica. -Don’t…
Weirdo scumbag!
-I don’t know, Margot. -You don’t know what, Juan?
If you want a family Christmas for that guy,
the kids and even my mom need to be here.
Without meeting Mónica’s new boyfriend?
Or Samuel’s girlfriend?
Without knowing who your mom’s latest victim is?
Are you ashamed of us, Juan?
Do you want to hide us, hide them?
What? I don’t want them to hide!
How could I want that?
I’m the proudest dad there ever was.
Think about what’s at stake with Londoño if anything goes wrong.
You need to trust me and the kids on this.
And even my mom.
Yes, you’re right.
Come.
Listen up, guys!
We want Mr. Londoño to have the best impression in the world.
No, not just the world.
In the universe!
For him to feel the spirit of…
Mónica!
So we need to work as a team.
Mónica will do the manger.
Samuel does the music. Carols, nothing gloomy.
And Mom, fritters and custard.
-What? I don’t-- -You make them so yummy.
She’s great at it.
And Dad’s in charge of the entertainment.
Magic and a comedy show.
Make that just magic.
We’ll make it a special evening.
And make Mr. Londoño feel at home.
Okay?
DECEMBER 16TH - FIRST NOVENA DAY
There’s a crafty geezer under your bed
With cheeks like a clown A stinger in his hand
If you show up here Yelling, “Ho ho ho!”
You better watch out You dirty old man You better watch out You dirty old man
Stay away from my house Screw you, Santa Claus
Or else I’ll smash that cute nose of yours
For all the presents I never got
Screw you, Santa Claus!
I have to admit, it’s original.
-It’s called “Screw Santa.” -Okay.
I’ve got another Christmas carol.
“Christmas Busts My Balls.” Want to hear it?
Balls. Right. Balls.
No, but you see… Listen, Sammy.
I think your lyrics are inappropriate for this time of the year.
I’d try to avoid foul language and all the attitude.
-But that’s me, okay? -No, Dad.
It’s precisely that critical thinking that makes it
It’s precisely that critical thinking that makes it a special, unique, credible song.
-Balls? -Balls.
I’m done!
Dad, this is so cool! These are all the banks.
The financial district and a cool World Center.
Plus, a private heliport for top investors and executives.
-Top executives and investors. -What nonsense!
And where’s the manger where Baby Jesus is born?
I could put some squatters on top of the hill.
But it ruins the whole idea. Is it really necessary?
Yes, and switch the suits for some shepherds,
and the investors for the Magi, period!
-You do it! -What was our agreement?
It’s pure teamwork. No “Screw Santa.” Out of the way.
-No! -The money god.
As an atheist, I only believe in the god of money.
I’ve had it! I’m a lousy cook! Christmas dinner is rice and eggs.
We need a new plan here.
-Breathe, Mom. -It was an accident.
-Accident? She almost blew us up. -We stick to our plan!
-That must be Destroyer. -Who?
My boyfriend. Don’t you dare make me look bad.
Boyfriend? Let’s see your brother-in-law.
Destro!
-That’s your boyfriend? -Yes, Mom, Destroyer. Come in, baby.
We’ll never know why he’s called Destroyer.
-Thank God! Hallelujah! -We don’t need eggs this week.
No, Dad, stop. She’s Rosalba. The sin I left Argentina for.
-Want a drink? -No, thanks.
I don’t even have communion wine. Lemonade is fine.
-Take me soon, Lord! -No idea.
-That’s your side of the family. -My family? Leave my mom alone.
-She is a nun, man! -No, Dad, she’s a woman first.
Yes, but a woman who gave her love to the Lord.
To God, not to men. Samuel, please.
No, I’m finishing the song to ask her to leave the convent.
It’s called “Let Me See the Treats You Hide under Your Habit.”
-Mónica! -What?
Why is he called Destroyer?
He looks like a serial killer from a movie,
not like a nice guy from a nice family.
Dad, his full name is Destroyer Urrutia Pombo.
His dad owns a big European construction company.
I guess his dad is so busy
he has no idea what that kid is up to.
Deal with it, guys.
Destroyer will be your grandchildren’s dad.
You’re a kid. What are you thinking?
My mom is here!
-Grandma? -Call her Amalia, not Grandma.
-Amalia! -That’s all we needed.
-Hi. -Grandma.
What did I say?
-It’s not Grandma. It’s Amalia. -Amalia.
This is great. Are you staying with us?
Of course. For a few days.
I just want you to meet my fiancé, Martín Guerra.
Nice to meet you.
Girls, you asked for it.
Let’s meet the boss.
Let me see you. Sweet!
Watch it. Don’t call him Corrupt. He hates it.
Holy Father! Daddy. Dear Daddy!
I mean it! I’m so glad to see you!
How are you, Heriberto?
Fine, Dad. Nice to see you. You look great.
Meet Astrid, Mayerli. Say hello, girls.
Nice to meet you.
Party time, Dad. Look what I got you for the novenas.
Can we have a minute, please?
-With the girls? -Come on, Heriberto.
Hold on, girls.
How dare you come here with these women?
Keep a low profile, remember?
But Dad, I thought maybe--
Stop showing off like this, you moron.
Our business depends on not attracting any attention.
Sorry, Dad.
Get rid of them so we can talk. I don’t have all day!
Yes. Girls!
-Go over there. That’s so rude! -Yes, Dad.
Girls.
-Martín’s been modeling for ten years. -Fifteen, baby.
Right, 15 years, on the covers of international fashion magazines.
-Just in 50. -But he’s more than a cute face.
He won the Pan-American Triathlon twice.
Plus, he owns several hotels, restaurants in Miami.
In Madrid and Rome, bella.
And he’s in Bogotá to invest in the country.
I’ll check the fritters. Be right back.
Go ahead. Fritters are what most matter.
Honey, it’s your lucky day.
Martín is an international chef.
He’ll help you with all the stuff in the kitchen.
So don’t worry.
No, Dad. Could you repeat that?
I’ll tell you for the umpteenth time!
Traditionally, the third generation of people like us
is the one that ends up becoming law-abiding again, and you must look after your wife and son, my grandson.
and you must look after your wife and son, my grandson.
-Yes, but our stuff business-- -No!
We need to be two steps ahead.
We’re going to invest money in hotels like this.
In less than two years we need to invest as much cash as possible
In less than two years we need to invest as much cash as possible in legitimate businesses, is that clear?
in legitimate businesses, is that clear?
I thought--
I came here to infiltrate the cops and delete whatever they have on us.
Lieutenant González seems to be in charge,
but I know how to contact him, and I want to hire a fabulous guy.
Some poor wannabe magician was heaven-sent,
the ideal front man for my money-laundering scam.
A magician? I can help you, Dad.
-Right. -Sure. Remember that box--
Yes. Guess how you can help me.
-How? -Staying out of it and keeping quiet.
-And I want you to study. -No, Dad. Why study? I suck at it.
You don’t suck at it. You’re stupid!
But make the effort.
I need a diploma to prove you at least finished grade school.
-Fine. -One more thing.
Now that I’m here, I want us to have a family Christmas.
-Together? -Yes.
-As a family? -My grandson called.
-Oswaldito? -To complain about you.
About what?
He says you’re never at home. I believe him.
You’re out partying all the time with those easy girls you like.
No, Dad. What easy girls?
-They’re friends. I’m surprised-- -Don’t be. I’m not surprised.
Brace yourself. We’re spending Christmas with your wife and my grandson.
We’re spending Christmas with your wife and my grandson.
Dad, what was it you said right after “traditionally”?
Oh, for the love of…
-I got it, Mr. Juan. -I was worried. Where were you?
What took you so long?
Mr. Juan, the thing is,
it’s hard to find a trained bunny in December.
-Where’s Joselín? -I guess he was bored.
He looked dejected, like he wanted to retire.
Germán won’t give you any problems. He’s such a smart bunny.
I hope he’s the world’s smartest. My guest is very special.
I need to dazzle him, as he’s my ticket to Vegas,
to make it in the big leagues.
What do I owe you?
Can you put it in your notebook?
No worries. It’s your Christmas present.
You’re always nice to me. Isn’t he cute?
Gorgeous. I’m speechless. This is awesome.
I need to go.
There’s a genius in the kitchen stealing the show.
I need to get back in control. Go on.
Call me if you need anything, Mr. Juan.
-Luchito. -Yes, sir?
-Who are you praying the novena with? -No one, Mr. Juan. It’s just me.
Shouldn’t you explain it to Trashy yourself?
Tell him that, due to family issues,
you can’t spend Christmas in the Bahamas.
I can’t, Counselor. It’s an important meeting.
And an awesome Christmas party.
He’s even flying some floozies in from Brazil.
You need to understand our priority, the wishes of your dad, Mr. Gustavo.
What’s up with Dad anyway? He’s getting old.
-Should we quit the business? -He has his reasons.
We must show him the business is going really well.
That’s why I need my meeting with Trashy to happen in the Bahamas.
What about your dad? He would want a family Christmas.
-The kid’s been whining again. -Oswaldito?
Yes, but I have a plan to distract him. I need you and the guys to help.
Who are “the guys”?
Giggles, Eternal Hangover, Blackout, to prove they’re more than mere henchmen.
I have this great plan. Call them. I need to do it now.
This is awesome.
-Cow or bull? -Cow.
-Because? -Because…
Two cows and a bull for the manger.
-What happened here? -Really, what happened?
An accident?
Don’t worry. Don’t panic. The first thing we need to do is…
-Girls, go tidy up the kitchen. -Yes, tidy up the kitchen.
Luchito’s staying for dinner.
-Hi. -Nice to meet you, Martín.
Same here.
The key word here is créativité. Creativity, if you don’t speak French.
Please pay attention. He’s a genius.
Why complicate things? We can work with what we have.
Right, work with what we have.
Allez, allez, allez. I need a team here.
-You. -Me?
-The guy with the stache. -Juan?
-Juan. -Juan!
You are in charge of organization and cleanup.
Clean and organize.
While Margot and I decide what to cook this evening.
What do you say to…
rabbit in garlic sauce?
Hey!
Germán has a vital mission tonight.
Who?
-Germán the bunné. -The what?
People can be so weird on Christmas,
and in this story, nobody was what they seemed to be.
I was the only one to see that, but I kept quiet
to see how they’d get out of the mess they were getting into.
-Meet my son. Baby, look. -Thanks.
-This is him. -Nice to meet you. Alirio Satizábal.
-Gustavo Ortiz. -Thanks.
Alirio organizes trips to Rome and the Holy Land,
following the steps of our blessed Lord Jesus.
That’s interesting.
He lives in Lima, but he is visiting Bogotá.
Since he’s on his own, I said,
“Let’s pray the novena together.”
I can’t go, so I thanked her. I have a meeting with my boss.
-Too bad. You should’ve stayed. -Young man.
Your mom says you’re a cop?
That’s right. Why?
He wants to sell them his travel packages.
They’re awesome and affordable.
I can offer the National Police a special price.
I could speak with the entire top brass with your help.
And with a good amount of travelers,
your ticket and your mom’s would not be a pecuniary issue.
-A what? -Free.
Awesome! Thank God for this opportunity!
Thank God, Mom. Where are my sisters?
Remember I told you about Rosalba?
-She was in Argentina. -Yes.
She brought some packages from Buenos Aires for the Barefoot Nuns and stayed for the novena.
for the Barefoot Nuns and stayed for the novena.
Sweetie!
Oh, you have a parrot?
No, that’s what I call my daughter, to annoy her. I haven't seen them.
This is important, Mom. I invited my boss to the novena.
Your boss from the police?
Yes, I’m a cop.
My boss looks tough on the outside, but he’s a real softie at heart.
-Your boss? -Yes, my boss.
Give him a chance. The guy is all alone in the world.
The holidays hit him hard.
This is a godsend, honey!
If he’s all alone in the world,
he only needs to meet Rebeca. I’ll do the introductions.
-Kill two birds with one stone. -Precisely!
I have two unmarried daughters. It could drive anyone crazy!
And let me tell you, Rebeca’s really missing the boat.
That must be my boss.
-Hi, Ortiz. -Welcome. Glad you could make it.
-Please meet my mother. -Charmed.
Asunción Ortega, the widow of Mr. Ortiz. And this is Alirio Satizábal.
-Lorenzo González. It’s a pleasure. -The pleasure is mine.
And she is the queen of the house.
Rebeca, want to come downstairs?
Quit the parrot thing, Mom.
How are you?
Awesome, now that you’re here. Thanks.
I love it! Smile! Where’s the airplane?
Sweet deal, Boss!
This is awesome! I love it!
-What’s this? -The labs, sir.
A hideout for the guys.
The clandestine airstrip. Nicely trimmed plants.
And the manger where the Lord Jesus will be born.
I love it.
And a bunch of hit men to protect Baby Jesus and the Magi.
Excellent.
-Good news. -What?
I got you hideouts.
-Where? I don’t see them. -Exactly, Boss.
Exactly, Boss! Great!
And the music?
-“Silent Night” and “Mi burrito sabanero.” -Great!
Counselor.
Did you get the 235 toys the kid wants?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Can we practice “Ho ho ho”?
Ho ho ho.
No, Counselor. This must be just perfect.
A little lower.
Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho.
Good! Everything must be perfect.
If Oswaldito is happy and stops whining to Dad,
we can do whatever we like for Christmas.
The kid will be here soon.
Hide, Counselor. Brigitte is with him. It’s a surprise.
What’s that?
Balls, Boss.
Balls. Boss.
Everything is ready.
-Are you sure that bunny-- -Germán.
Will Germán do what we need?
Sure, he’s a trained bunny. Look at him.
Good. He’d better.
I failed Mr. Londoño once.
If I fail twice, I’ll ruin my chance of making it in the big leagues.
We’re gonna rock. Right, Germán?
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen.
Please let them rock, take me to Vegas as his assistant with Germán--
Quit the crap and move it!
As my grandpa, who was wiser than me, used to say,
“We cannot judge a book by its cover.”
Meet my family.
My son Samuel is an artist too.
-Singer-songwriter. -Say hello.
How are you, sir?
-Stop. She’s the nun from the convent. -Glory be to God, brother.
-This is-- -My boyfriend.
-Hey. -They call him Destroyer.
-Urrutia Pombo. -Why?
My daughter.
Mónica Morales. I have some business ideas--
Stop it!
And she is…
-This is the old one. -What?
My adorable mother-in-law.
Exactly.
-A pleasure to meet you, ma’am. -It’s “miss,” please.
-Miss? Sure. -Yes.
Look who’s here.
She… Come here.
This is my wife, Margot. The light of our home.
Thank you. You’re too kind. Picture time?
-And this is-- -My fiancé, Martín.
-Guerra. Hi. Who’s that? -And this is Luchito.
What’s up, man?
Luchito is the family’s fresh friend.
And that’s it. That’s all of us.
Yes. All of us.
Basically.
Well, what a…
diverse family, I dare say, but lovely.
Congratulations…
-Juan. -Juan.
“O Divine…
Child,
come to…
come to teach us…
the pru…
teach us the pru…
the prudence
that makes us… tru--
that makes us… tru-- Truly wise men.
Come to our souls, do not delay.
Come…
I’d better read the novena in front of the kid.
Why?
You’re his father figure,
and seeing you like that will make him crack up.
I don’t think so!
I have another surprise for you. Music, boys.
One, two, three, four…
Come, come
Come to our souls, Jesus
That’s enough! Be quiet!
-Why? -Because!
-Get rid of them. -No. Why?
Do it, Heriberto!
Just do it. And make a new manger.
-No! -No way!
Not the manger. It’s a theme manger.
Any other surprises?
Yes, and you’ll love this one.
Counselor!
Ho ho ho.
Merry Christmas.
Oswaldito will love this present.
“Sovereign Mary, for your great virtues
and especially for your humility,
you deserved the Lord to choose you as his mother.”
“I beg that you prepare and arrange my and everyone’s soul
at this time of praying this Advent prayer novena,
for the spiritual birth of your beloved son.”
“Oh, divine wisdom of the sovereign God
that became just a child!”
“Divine Child, come to teach us the prudence that makes truly wise men!”
“Come to our souls! Come, do not delay!”
Come, come
Come to our souls, Jesus, come
Come to our souls Jesus, come to our souls
Do not delay, do not delay, Jesus, come
Do not delay, do not delay Jesus, come, come
Awesome!
I know.
I forgot to tell you. Martincito is also a singer.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You think the kid is that dumb, Heriberto?
I don’t know, but he’s a kid.
Kids like Santa to bring them presents.
It’s not Christmas Eve, and he wrote to Jesus, not Santa.
Santa, Baby Jesus, it’s the same!
You think the kid won’t know it’s Quiroz?
Ho ho ho.
Is it that obvious?
He’ll ask why he's getting his presents now and not on the 24th.
Fine, let’s tell him I have a business trip on Christmas Day,
so we want him to enjoy his presents today.
You explain that to him.
Good luck with that.
Thanks.
No, Brigitte, no!
Sorry to have dinner here, but the dining room is too small.
Please don’t worry about it, ma’am. That’s fine with me.
See? I told you. He’s a gentleman!
Let’s eat. Enjoy.
-Thanks. -Thanks.
No!
-What’s going on? -What?
The secret ingredient’s missing. It’s very important.
Sweet!
Martín, it’s amazing what you did with so little in the fridge.
That’s me. I always say,
“Adversity is the mother of--”
-Of creativity. -Exactly, baby.
-No, it all depends, right? -Yes, it all depends.
No, it doesn’t.
None of this would be possible without you, Margot.
How do you do it?
How do you make everything so perfect?
-What’s your secret? -Well…
Sir, why don’t you tell us about your Vegas hotels?
Have you heard this? What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
Martín will show us how to make a cocktail he invented.
-You’ll love it, guys. -Just a minute. They don’t drink.
Party pooper.
-Samuel. -Yes?
-Singer-songwriter? -Yes.
I can sing my new Christmas songs.
No!
No!
But Martín has many friends in the music business.
I have contacts in LA, big-time producers.
I’ll introduce them to you. They’re great. Yes, you, Blondie.
I’m an experienced marketing agent. Please take me with you!
Hey! What’s going on here? Hold on a second.
The kids need to focus on what’s most important,
and that’s school, period.
-But-- -Mónica, there’ll be time later.
Calm down. Where were we?
As an after-dinner treat, sir,
I was bold enough to prepare a magic trick for you.
To make up for Little Candles Day at the office.
Great.
I forgot to tell you that Martín is a magician too.
-No! -Yes!
No!
It’s just a hobby.
That’s all we needed, right? A magician.
Full of surprises.
I’m not an expert like José, but I know a trick or two.
Juan!
My name…
is Juan!
Okay, Juan. Take it easy.
Why don’t we…
make the evening a little more exciting?
What have you got in mind, Juan?
Why don’t we have a competition?
A magic competition, of course.
We can each show what we can do.
Just say when… Juan.
Fine.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen.
Awesome!
Darling, let’s check on the fritters.
We’ll let you talk. You must have a lot to discuss.
-Thanks, Mom. -Okay, honey.
Have a seat. Don’t be so shy.
So, do you study or work?
What’s your hobby? Singing, dancing?
What’s this, gel or wax? It’s so hard.
It disappeared!
And that’s not all, my friends.
It won’t stop snowing tonight in Bogotá, hallelujah!
Hallelujah, sister!
Look, Margot. I made it snow for you!
Like in Switzerland, baby!
-Bravo! -Thank you!
Thank you, make way, please. I’m so sorry, boss.
Now, some real magic.
The stage is ready, Mr. Juan.
This is a shoe, just a shoe,
but very soon, thanks to the powers I was granted,
directly from the Magi,
it will turn into a bunny.
Here…
there is a bunny.
Please, assistant.
What an awesome magician!
Awesome magician!
It’s the thought that counts, right?
Let’s hear it for Juan! Come on!
Come on, guys! Juan!
Is the kid asleep?
Yes, he’s asleep. But he’s very sad, Heriberto.
Why don’t you stay and spend Christmas with us?
I can’t. I need to go. You don’t get it.
I must show Dad he’s wrong about me and he should listen to me.
Your dad asked you to do something else.
Go to school and quit the stuff business? You think that’s doable?
-Why not? -Because I can’t.
No, I can’t quit the business now.
And you know me, Brigitte.
I suck at studying and being cooped up in an office.
I need intensity, adrenaline, action!
Please, I need your help.
Talk to the kid,
tell him everything’s fine
and not to phone Dad to complain about me.
Trust me.
I promise you
it’s what’s best for us right now.
Germán! Where are you, you damn bunny?
Why are you doing this to me?
Where are you, Germán? Why?
Why?
St. John Bosco, what did I ever do to you?
Hey, geezer. Want to do some real magic?
What kind of nun is that?
I only gave her a little.
This can’t be real. Why does it happen to me?
Why me?
-Luchito, I need a favor. -You know you can always count on me.
Option four, you and me dancing closely in a hotel room.
-I need to go. -Say yes first.
-Are you crazy? -Over you.
I’m married, and you’re my mom’s boyfriend.
Tiny details. No problem.
-Excuse me. -The wine. Here!
What’s going on here?
-Nothing. -I love this wine.
-What? -What is this?
-What? -Nothing.
-You… -What?
You’re being fresh with my wife.
-With your wife? -In my house!
In your house? What? No. That’s horrible.
How disrespectful.
Dad, Grandma’s fighting with your boss. Hurry!
-Why? -Take me soon, Lord!
-Hi. -Hi. How are you?
Have you seen Destroyer?
No.
You’re mistaken, sir! How dare you?
-Calm down, miss. -No, I won’t. Why should I?
Nobody, let alone a jerk like you, has any say about my private life.
-What did I say? -What did you say?
And another thing,
if my dumb son-in-law thinks inviting you to dinner
if my dumb son-in-law thinks inviting you to dinner and bowing to you will change his pathetic life,
and bowing to you will change his pathetic life,
that doesn’t mean you can bother me!
Your dumb son-in-law is hopeless!
Oh, please! Get a load of this jerk!
Asking me why I’m with a younger guy.
Because your younger guy was in the kitchen…
Here he is.
He’s been up to no good in your den. What do I do?
-Throw him out. -Dad!
-Mónica! -I’ve had it!
Dad!
Honey.
I couldn’t sleep at all.
How could everything go that wrong?
Don’t be so hard on yourself, Juan. It’s not all your fault, honey.
I wonder what Mr. Londoño’s thinking.
You can kiss Vegas goodbye.
I’m sure I’ll be fired now.
What about Mónica’s boyfriend?
-And Samuel’s nun? Please! -No. Just a minute.
What about your mom’s boyfriend?
Circling his prey all night like a shark?
I’m so worried about my mom.
She’s totally in love with the guy.
Unknown number?
Hello.
Juan, it’s Alejandro Londoño.
Mr. Londoño. How are you?
Fine. How are you today?
I’m terribly embarrassed about what happened last night.
Don’t worry about it. That’s okay.
In fact, I’m calling to invite you.
Why don’t you and your family spend Christmas with me at my hotel?
I’d like to repay your kindness.
I’m sure we can make it very special
to make up for last night.
Oswaldito called you?
Yes, he says you’re not spending Christmas at home.
No…
Dad, I have plans for the 25th. I need to be in the Bahamas.
I was very clear about that when we spoke,
so quit dreaming and bring Brigitte and the kid
so quit dreaming and bring Brigitte and the kid to spend Christmas with me at my hotel.
-But, Dad! -No buts!
Christmas is for the family, not some lame plan with your buddies.
Christmas is for the family, not some lame plan with your buddies. Or cheating with some bimbos. That’s an order!
Or cheating with some bimbos. That’s an order!
Okay, Dad. Love you… Hello?
Brigitte!
Brigitte! What was our deal?
Don’t yell at me.
It’s not my fault the kid talked to his granddad.
I ran out of pigs?
Where are the other plastic pigs?
Get me those pigs now!
Ortiz, come on, focus.
We know he took a few days off on the coast, and guess what?
He’s in Bogotá.
Somebody said hello.
How did you make my sister fall so hard for you, brother-in-law?
Don’t make plans for December 25th.
My mom is preparing an amazing Christmas for you.
Listen up, you moron. Let’s focus on our job.
He has to make a mistake, but not just any mistake.
-A serious mistake. -Exactly.
-Right. -He’ll show up soon enough.
Good morning.
A promise is a promise, guys.
I’m here to explain all the details to you
I’m here to explain all the details to you about our corporate plan to visit the Holy Land.
You must ask what we call the trip.
It’s called “The New Templars.”
May I?
NATIONAL POLICE - WANTED
Mr. Juan!
Why is everything about Mónica?
Because that weirdo is totally useless.
-What do you want? -How about “good morning,” baby?
Still mad at me for kicking out your no-good boyfriend?
I did you a favor. Why don’t you get a new boyfriend?
I don’t think so.
I can give you the moon and stars.
-Really? -The constellations.
Quit hitting on me, or you’ll regret it!
-You want to see him, right? -Yes, ma’am.
Good luck, guys.
This is the real deal, Mr. Juan.
-Like it? -Yes. Male or female?
Her name is Marcela.
Female rabbits are much more obedient.
See how smart she is?
I’m not too sure about that.
Yes, we’ll see. Any Christmas Eve plans?
-Mr. Londoño invited us to his hotel. -He invited us?
Five stars at its finest!
I’d love to invite you, but you understand.
I don’t want to go to a five-star hotel
and toast “Merry Christmas” with a glass.
No? No, Christmas is a family event where you’re with your loved ones.
No, Christmas is a family event where you’re with your loved ones.
We’d be planning a huge bash if my loved ones were here.
Great food, potato salad, stuffed chicken.
It’s a date to rekindle our true essence, right?
That’s the price including a trip to where?
To Golgotha.
This is the price if we get 20 or more people.
But if we get 25 people,
Alirio is authorized to provide an extra ticket
with no pecuniary issues, in other words, totally free.
And to make your payments less burdensome, we have stretch loans,
And to make your payments less burdensome, we have stretch loans, or flexible loans, that adapt to any budget.
or flexible loans, that adapt to any budget.
I love it.
Great. Now I need a big favor.
Fill out these forms for me with your personal information.
Name, position, e-mail, phone, et cetera.
What for?
So Alirio can send you all the details about our packages.
Lieutenant.
How do you like this guy Alirio?
Actually, to be honest with you…
-I really don’t care. -No. I have a bad hunch.
He asks a lot of innocent questions, but guess what.
He’s hitting on my mom.
What are you, the jealous son? Grow up, you fool.
No, he’s up to something.
We look out for each other, and you’re family--
Cut the crap, bro!
Captain.
I need a favor.
I have this huge problem
I’m sure you can help me out with.
Tell me about it to see what I can do.
I was at the police headquarters.
I’ve got all the info we need to bug these guys.
Piece of cake.
Now I need you to organize my Christmas Eve party
to convince the magician’s family to let me hire them.
Yes, boss.
No worries, they won’t know what they’re getting into.
As you wish.
And I have a candidate for the other thing.
The magician’s mother-in-law’s fiancé.
That moron is perfect to convince Juanquini’s wife
and finalize the details of this deal.
Yes, sir.
CHRISTMAS EVE
Let’s go. It’s early.
No, Mónica, no!
Mónica!
-After you! -No!
-Mónica. -Yes.
Okay. Let’s go.
Oh, Juan!
-It’s Dad. -What?
I’m not going.
No way.
I’m not deserting the house. It’s my home, and you’re my family.
And Christmas needs to be celebrated with the family, at home.
What’s this about spending Christmas at a five-star hotel?
The story of the birth of Jesus,
the King of Kings, who could be born anywhere,
the Taj Mahal, Buckingham Palace,
five-star, anywhere he wanted, but he decided to be born in…
Me! In a manger in Bethlehem.
Exactly. Very good. That’s a huge message of humility.
It’s up to each of us, according to our possibilities,
to invite people to our homes to celebrate with us.
That’s lovely, Dad. That’s really sweet of you,
but we’ll have a lot of Christmases here.
Never in a luxury hotel! Tell him, Margot!
I totally agree with Mónica.
-What will you tell your boss? -I’ll just apologize.
-Isn’t it too late? -Better late than never.
-I’m meeting Rosalba at the hotel, Dad. -What a drag this sourpuss is.
Stay if you want, no problem. Nobody’s begging you, but us girls?
-We’re gone! -Merry Christmas.
-Come, Margot. -Move it, Margot.
Merry Christmas! Bye! Move it, girls.
Mr. Juan! Buddy!
Mr. Juan.
I just bumped into your family. They said you’re staying here all alone?
-Yes, Lucho. Come here. -What’s wrong?
Nothing, I remembered what you said, and you’re totally right.
Christmas needs to be spent at home. Period.
I can keep you company if you like.
Thanks.
You’re a good guy, Lucho. I appreciate it.
And even if it’s you and me all by ourselves,
we’ll have a ball, okay?
What are we going to eat?
I know I promised to come over, but I just couldn’t make it.
No! I’m so sorry!
Not even for a while?
Not even that.
But I, Alirio Satizábal, promise that on New Year’s Eve,
But I, Alirio Satizábal, promise that on New Year’s Eve, we’ll be together.
Okay. You promise?
Yes, of course.
I’m sorry, I have to go now. My boss is here.
Have a Merry Christmas,
say hi to your kids from Alirio Satizábal, your humble servant.
-The Godfather! -Come in.
I asked you to come early to talk business.
If you invest in mine--
I like being clear, so I’ll get straight to the point.
-Shoot. -You are a full-time con man!
What?
Don’t pretend you are respectable. I checked you out.
You have none of the titles you claim.
You have none of the titles you claim. None of the property or the companies.
You’re a big fat nobody,
living off older women as a gigolo.
The only job you ever had was doing magic shows at kids' parties.
What’s your stage name?
Papayita. Am I wrong?
No worries. Don’t look like that, man.
I admire your talent as an impostor,
and that’s why I’m making this offer.
It’s very lucrative,
and it doesn’t require a lot of work.
You can’t leave in the middle of Christmas.
What am I supposed to do with the fritters, the custard?
With everything I made? No way.
-Mom! -Christmas is a family event!
-Mom, stop whining! -Where’s your Christmas spirit?
I told you I promised a girlfriend to spend the night with her.
I promised, okay? Got it?
Let her go, Mom.
She’s the black sheep of the family, so let her go.
Always the weirdo. Look at her.
Yes, Rosalba. What nerve! This house is not a hotel.
Can’t you spend one Christmas with your poor mom?
No, Tavo.
Your emotional blackmail won’t work with me.
Bye, family, and Merry Christmas.
Bye! -You need to be disciplined! -Bye.
A girlfriend? Wherever she’s going, it’s not to a friend’s place.
Don’t be such a gossip, and get dressed.
Lieutenant González is coming soon, and I need you to captivate him!
That’s him.
Oh, no! Wait! Where are you going?
No way. Don’t open that door yet.
Do you love me? Give me a Christmas present.
You need to get engaged with the Lieutenant tonight.
Do yourself a favor. Get rid of the whiskers.
To make sure you score!
-Where’s the wax? -In the cabinet. Go. Chop-chop!
-Hi, Lieutenant. -Good evening.
I hope you don’t mind. I invited my girlfriend.
Merry…
Merry Christmas, Destro. Take my picture by the Christmas tree.
-Mónica! -What?
-What a sweet couple. -Yes, right?
-Those hearts. How sweet! -Mr. Alejandro.
-Juan couldn’t make it. -No?
No. He’s sick. Yes.
But he said he’d call you later.
What a shame. We’ll miss him… -A lot. -A lot.
But he needs to get better.
Right. He needs to get better.
Is all this space just for us?
Of course. We don’t want to be bothered.
Ma’am, enjoy the evening, please.
Excuse me.
A toast to the evening’s most beautiful ragazza.
My sixth and final offer to you.
-No. I’m not interested. -It’s a business deal.
I spoke with your husband’s boss.
I want to give him an opportunity.
We’re building a huge, heavenly, luxury hotel chain in Colombia.
And I want you to run it.
Me?
You’d be your own boss, have your own office,
and a salary with a lot of zeros to the right.
Say yes, come on.
Fine. Not tonight.
But think about it, okay?
Mon amour.
Take me soon, Lord!
Yes, you can. Inhale peace, exhale anxiety and the hatred.
We didn’t know you had a girlfriend.
We have been together just two weeks. Right, baby?
-Yes, baby. -Really? Why didn’t you tell me?
Why is my private life any of your business?
How would I know?
Let’s pray the novena. I’m eager to pray.
-Playing dumb, Lorenzo? -Don’t be rude.
Playing dumb, right?
-Mom! -We’ll leave if you’re being rude!
You thought bringing this bimbo to my house was a good idea?
We’re a nice family. Please.
Doesn’t this crazy old hag know who I am?
Excuse me?
Old hag? Look who’s talking. I am a decent lady.
It’s clear you are a home-wrecker.
Rebeca, please show some respect. She’s a colleague, our boss.
She’s right. You guys have awful colleagues.
Why is this slut interfering in my baby’s relationship?
-What relationship? -With the Lieutenant.
-What relationship? -What? Hello.
-Home-wrecker. -What?
-Let’s do something. -What?
You invited me to…
Are you sure?
No, we’ll handle it.
I said we’ll handle it, bro.
What is it? You look pale.
Alirio.
Now what happened to Alirio?
Alirio is not Alirio. He’s the Mafia boss, Lieutenant.
No! Why Alirio?
No!
From the first moment I saw you
I’ve been thinking about you Which is so unlike me
I want to sleep on top of you
Under your habit
I dreamed of you On the clouds of my mattress
I wanted to become a sexton
Clothes don’t make the man Or a mane the king of the jungle
But I am your savior
So nice, right? So romantic.
I wish I had the courage to open my heart, to…
express my feelings.
From the moment I saw you, I fell in love with you.
I want to sleep on top of you. There!
I said it!
How dare you say that in front of my mom?
-Who? -My mom.
I’m opening my heart to you.
What does that have to do with it?
For the last time, I am a happily married woman.
In love with my husband.
Yes, that’s the part I really don’t get.
How, when, and why did you fall in love with such a mediocre guy?
Don’t you dare talk about my husband like that.
Juan is a loser.
Hold on. Listen to me.
Juan may not be as successful, or have your millions,
or be as cute as you, but I love him!
Just a minute. What’s going on here?
Nothing important, we’re just--
-Nobody talks about Juan like that. -Okay.
Is this guy bashing Dad?
-Of course not. -What, you jerk?
Easy, guys. You got me wrong.
-It’s a harmless comment, right? -That was nasty, Martín.
Listen, kiss-ass. Only we can call Dad mediocre.
Or a loser, or whatever!
Only we can!
-That’s enough. -Thanks, baby.
Don’t you know it’s Christmas? Forgive me, Margot,
but we won’t let your absent husband ruin the evening.
-Mom! -What?
That’s all.
Lieutenant, you know I never trusted the guy.
So I asked Intelligence to investigate him.
I had to insist you to investigate him!
I had a bad feeling about him ever since he tried to sell us his Holy Land trip.
-I told you so. -What did they say?
They’re planning a Christmas party at the hotel.
I’m calling for backup.
I apologize to you guys for all the crap my sister said,
but you didn’t say you were dating.
What can I do, Trashy?
You know what Dad is like when it comes to our family.
You know how my beloved dad gets if I defy him.
I’m the hothead here, and--
Hello? Trashy!
Trashy is mad at me for not taking that trip.
-We have a problem, sir. -What is it?
The cops are at the hotel to arrest your dad.
It can get ugly.
-What? -The cops are at the hotel--
Yes, you moron! How did you find out?
From the cops’ phones your dad tapped.
We need to call him.
You call him. He won’t take my calls.
Can we go now?
The kid is falling asleep.
Watch it, guys.
Check every nook and cranny. Get in the kitchen!
-Move it! -Watch the door!
-What? Ortiz! -Get in the kitchen.
-Ortiz! -What?
-So much fuss, and where are they? -I don’t know.
Did you get your info at the barbershop or what?
Damn!
“Key of David, which opens the exiled gates of the magnificent palace.
Save us, Baby Jesus, with your pure hand, from the sad prison of sin.”
Come, come
Come to our souls
Come, come, Jesus
Come to our souls, Jesus
Come to our souls
Do not delay and tarry not Come, come, Jesus
Come, come
You have no idea how happy I am to see you guys.
I missed you guys so much.
We really missed you guys.
We decided that Christmas is to be spent with our family.
What about your mom?
We had a problem, and she decided not to come back.
What a shame.
My phone is ringing. It’s Mom!
What a shame.
Mom.
Margot,
please help me.
They’ll kill me.
What do you mean, Mom?
Alejandro and Martín are crooks. They kidnapped me.
What? What do you mean?
Yes! Please help me!
Let’s go. The plane’s waiting.
-The plane? Where are we going? -Go!
Go!
Any news?
Neither the people at the restaurant nor Security know anything.
The guy that threw the party is in this room?
Yes, Alejandro Londoño.
It makes me mad that no one in the hotel knows anything.
They didn’t ask for ID or know how many people came.
They’re all gone. Nobody’s cooperating, Captain.
-You know what? -What?
-There’s an accomplice here. -Yes, that’s what we think.
We don’t see why they refuse to cooperate,
but don’t worry. We’re interrogating the rest of the staff.
I called the airport to make sure Londoño does not get away.
May I go…?
So I’d better…
I’ll stay with you for a while, Captain.
So you’re in this together.
Did you plan to get us involved in your dirty business?
Is your name Alejandro Londoño or not?
We can’t leave the country just like that.
We are not including you.
For you, my dear lady, this adventure is over.
What will you do to me?
-Hit starter. -This piece of crap is jammed!
-Mr. Juan! -Rev up.
This piece of trash had to crash now? What a bummer!
-They stopped. -Really?
-We’re close. -Are you sure?
-Yes. -Call the cops, guys!
Remember, it’s Christmas Eve, Samuel.
I don’t want any trouble with your grandma,
calling the cops without knowing what the crazy hag is up to.
She’s smart enough to leave her phone on.
So why is she in this mess? Does it say how far we need to go?
-Two blocks, sir. -Perfect!
-This way, sir. -Wake up.
Move it.
That wasn’t the only surprise the Morales family got that Christmas.
And I hate to say everyone showed their true colors.
I’m sorry, ma’am. I can’t deal with this.
I have a confession to make. I’m not a nun!
-What? -What?
I had to make up that story to hold on to Samuel.
I’ve heard enough!
Please tell Samuel that I loved meeting him,
that he’s a smoking hot blond kid, but he should not try to contact me.
Here, cleanse your sins.
I wish you a Merry…
Mónica!
What, Margot?
My brother’s been dumped before. It inspires his lyrics.
Why don’t they call us?
They just vanished. I’m desperate. Please call them.
-Do me a favor. -What?
Help me find Destroyer. I can’t find him.
I wish you a Merry… Destroyer!
Honey!
-Move it! -No!
I’m sorry it had to end like this.
We would’ve made a great couple,
but you don’t always get what you want.
Stop!
Leave my mother-in-law alone, Mr. Londoño.
-It’s not Londoño. -What?
How are you going to stop me, Mr…?
Juan Morales.
I assure you it’s a lot better if you drop the gun.
Too late, I planned to kill just the lady,
but as you have arrived,
there’s enough to go around.
No! Drop it!
Crap!
Awesome magician!
Tropical magic.
Off we go! Let’s go!
He took the bunny! Marcela did her job.
Marcela’s the bunny that…
He almost killed us.
That was a real gun with real bullets.
-But it worked. -Yes! It did!
He’s not the only mobster to get away, González.
We’ll have our revenge when we catch him.
Meanwhile, all we can do tonight is celebrate.
I spoke with your dad.
He’s on a private jet to the Bahamas.
The Bahamas. Of course.
Dad.
He’s closing the deal with Trashy.
Damn it!
See, Counselor? No one knows who they work for.
I did all the work, and he gets all the credit.
Boss, relax. Get it off your mind.
Have this in one shot and have some fun with your wife.
What else can I do?
Call Oswaldito to say the novena. I’ll read it.
-No. -No.
-Why not? -Well…
Mom, I’ll die if anything happens to you.
I have to admit that your husband saved my life.
-He’s a hero. -Yes.
You’re a hero.
No, I’m not. We owe it to a noble act of magic.
Mrs. Margot, how could you miss his great trick?
-I missed it. -Your boss, Dad? Your lover, Grandma?
I don’t want to know.
I need to forget this disaster ever happened.
Listen, Mom…
-How’s my family doing? -Stop it!
-Lucho, get this bum out of this house! -You again?
Rosalba!
-Watch it, Lucho! -Where are you, my love?
Please!
Where’s my sweet nun?
Rosalba!
Rosalba.
Just like Mónica said,
the experience inspired Samuel to write the lyrics
that completed his album: Christmas Carols to Hate Other People.
The new song was called “Don’t Fall for a Fake Nun in December.”
All through Christmas Eve, Ortiz had to console his mom
All through Christmas Eve, Ortiz had to console his mom and his older sister, whose hearts were broken.
We need to watch who we look at. Only losers fall in love.
Big-time losers.
Lieutenant González was promoted to Captain,
not because his mission was successful,
but because of the fun Captain Cucalón had with him.
She recommended him to her superiors.
Ready? Hurry up!
Ñato finally spent Christmas with his family.
And he really enjoyed it.
Is the kid asleep?
Yes.
He’s sound asleep.
Okay.
I made up my mind,
and you’re the light of my eyes, of our home, my everything,
so I want you to be the first to know.
I’m listening.
The instant that we come back from our vacation,
I’m quitting my job to be a full-time magician.
You see, today, I asked Baby Jesus for a sign.
And Baby Jesus… Baby Jesus sent me an amazing sign!
What do you think?
-I’m with you all the way! -Really?
Yes, I’m so happy for you.
So, you and Samuel are the artists, and Mónica and I, the producers.
-I love it. -You do?
Honey, that’s why I love you.
And I love you, great Juanquini. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Although we all had plans for 2020, and we know what happened,
I have to admit that thanks to those scumbags,
December 2019
was one of the best months I spent with the Morales.
What can I do if I’m not a saint?
Anyway, and in case I forgot, Merry Christmas.
Gus! I was in the cockpit.
It was my dream since childhood. Awesome!
-Is the door closed? -Closed and locked, Captain.
Wasn’t I supposed to lock it?
We can fix it. No worries.
THE JAPANESE INVASION LEFT THE SOUTHERN LANDS OF JOSEON IN RUINS.
AND NOW ANOTHER STORM WAS LOOMING IN THE NORTHERN LANDS OF JOSEON.
THE JURCHENS ACROSS THE MANCHURIAN PLAIN NORTH OF THE AMNOK RIVER
STARTED GATHERING AT THE BASIN OF THE PAJEO RIVER
UNDER THE FLAG OF THE VICIOUS, POWERFUL PAJEOWI.
WHEN 10,000 JURCHENS GATHER, NO ARMY IN THE WORLD CAN DEFEAT THEM.
FEELING THREATENED BY THE PAJEOWI'S SUSPICIOUS MOVE,
WARRIORS OF JOSEON SCOUTED ANOTHER GROUP OF THE JURCHENS
IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM IN CHECK.
THEY WERE JURCHENS LIVING IN JOSEON CALLED SEONGJEOYAIN.
SINCE THEY HAD LIVED IN JOSEON FOR OVER A CENTURY,
THEY WERE NEITHER CONSIDERED JURCHENS
NOR ACCEPTED BY THE PEOPLE OF JOSEON AS THEIR OWN
AND WERE SHUNNED BY ALL.
THIS PLANT BRINGS THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE… BUT YOU MUST PAY THE PRICE
JURCHEN JOSEON, HANYANG
PAJEOWI, BOUNDARY VILLAGE, PYESA-GUN
PYESA-GUN
What's that?
CITADEL OF MANPO
Isn't he the deputy commander of the Chupajin troops?
Don't tell me there's another debacle coming.
I suppose the rumors are true.
What rumors?
Well…
I heard some Jurchens went into Pyesa-gun to get wild ginseng
and were all killed.
What? It's against the law to enter Pyesa-gun.
I can't believe such a horrible thing happened there.
I heard something scary lives there.
I heard none of those wild ginseng hunters came back out alive.
No one has been allowed to enter for the past 100 years.
Who knows if some vicious monster lives there?
They all have the same tattoo.
They're Pajeowi Jurchens.
The word has already spread.
It's only a matter of time before the Pajeowi find out.
What should we do?
Let's go to the boundary village.
Do not look.
Animal blood and innards are for the lowborn.
There. It's ready.
Remove your filthy hands.
Let's go.
Hey!
Let's have some meat!
BOUNDARY VILLAGE
A VILLAGE WHERE THE JURCHENS IN JOSEON LIVE
This is good.
It tastes amazing.
It's great!
How long has it been since we last had meat?
It's Ashin!
Ashin!
Come, Ashin. Let's eat.
Do you want some more?
It's good, isn't it?
Hey! How dare you?
Give it back.
-Hey-- -I'm sorry.
I told you not to go to Pyesa-gun!
But you said it's not actually dangerous there.
You told me yourself that people in high places spread false rumors
so they could take all the wild ginseng.
That's why you should never go there.
Soldiers are more dangerous than monsters.
Then what do we do?
Just let Mom die?
They say the wild ginseng there can even bring back the dead--
You're not a ginseng hunter.
How will you find wild ginseng in that huge mountain?
I'm not sure if it was wild ginseng, but I saw a strange plant.
It was drawn on a mural at an abandoned shrine.
It says it can bring back the dead.
Nonsense.
There are no shrines left in that area.
-But I saw it-- -Stop talking nonsense.
Listen to me and do not go there.
Those who sneaked in there and got caught
had their tongues cut out.
I can never let that happen to you.
I was planning to travel to Chupajin
to offer these gifts to you, my lord.
Fifteen Pajeowi Jurchens who went into Pyesa-gun
to hunt wild ginseng were all found dead.
Are you sure they are the Pajeowi Jurchens?
But who would do something like that?
A tiger.
You will have to cross the river.
Go spread the word that all the Pajeowi Jurchens
were killed by a tiger.
Understood, my lord.
When will my village
receive an official government position?
We are aware of your loyalty.
Be patient and wait.
Good news will come.
We’re heading out. Get ready.
JOSEON MILITARY CAMP, CHUPAJIN
We have brought all the corpses found in Pyesa-gun as you ordered, sir.
We've verified that the limbs were torn by wild animals,
but it happened postmortem.
It wasn't a tiger.
They were killed by humans.
I am aware.
If 10,000 Jurchens gather…
a great danger will befall us.
Hold out a hand, and you shall receive help.
Pull out a knife, and you shall be slain.
While Joseon was floundering in chaos during the Japanese invasion,
Aidagan, the head of the Pajeowi,
has gathered the Jurchens under his wing.
The Japanese in the south are preparing another attack.
If the Pajeowi in the north use this as a reason to invade us as well,
what will happen to this country?
We can never let them know their men were killed by our people.
They were attacked…
by a tiger.
The deputy commander from Chupajin is here.
Let him in.
Have a drink, my lord
What brings you here at this hour?
We found 15 dead Pajeowi Jurchens.
Are you certain there were 15 of them?
Why? Did I get the number wrong?
I heard you went hunting in the Birch Pass two days ago.
Since when…
do I need your permission to go hunting?
Pajeowi Jurchens receive martial arts training from an early age.
It is near impossible to take down 15 of them at once.
Unless it was you and your elite guards who did it.
You'd better discipline your men before someone else finds out.
Those Jurchen rats…
dared to steal the Haewon Cho Clan's wild ginseng.
They all deserved to die.
You should have captured and punished them according to the law.
And the Haewon Cho Clan does not own those wild ginseng.
They belong to His Majesty the King.
Do you think you can insult me and my family like this
just because I am stuck
in the boondocks now?
You abandoned the people and fled during the war.
That is why you're here.
If you endanger this country once again,
you will not be able to avoid the consequences…
even if you are from the Haewon Cho Clan.
The people are growing anxious,
so I will begin a tiger hunt to calm them.
I advise you to stay put and stay out of trouble.
This is a warning.
AMNOK RIVER, BORDER AREA
BOUNDARY VILLAGE
Are you sure it was a tiger?
The Pajeowi learn martial arts as soon as they can walk.
How can a single tiger kill them all?
If it's a lie,
it'll rub them the wrong way.
It might put you in danger, Father.
Being undercover
is always dangerous.
Look after the family while I'm gone.
All right, then.
Let's just cross the river and go back to our clan.
You let them take all your hard-earned pelts
and even risk your life to go undercover for them.
Will you let them walk all over you forever?
Pyesa-gun. Our ancestors lived there.
The King of Joseon bestowed the land upon our clan,
who was battling hunger and thieves on the barren field
on the other side of the river.
The King also offered us a public office
and exempted us from paying taxes.
Joseon was gracious to us.
Hence, I cannot betray Joseon.
They may have been gracious to our ancestors,
but they took back everything they had given us.
Hang in there just a little longer.
Soon, I will officially be appointed and we'll be able to live a good life.
I think we should call for a doctor.
You know very well
that no doctor would come here.
Then what do we do?
Stay with Mom until I come back.
Ashin! Hurry back!
JURCHEN VILLAGE, NORTH OF AMNOK RIVER
Far past the Amnok River
is Mount Baekdu, Joseon's highest mountain.
It's so huge that you'll find all kinds of trees and animals.
The most famous one among them
is the tiger.
They say that this tiger is 1,000 years old.
Sometimes, it even transforms into a human.
Lies!
No, it's true!
Over 1,000 men have gone into the mountain to catch the tiger, but they all died.
Even the Pajeowi Jurchens who climbed the Birch Pass recently
all got eaten by that tiger.
Is that true?
It sure is.
I saw it with my own two eyes.
You'd better be telling the truth.
If you're spreading false rumors,
you will die.
PYESA-GUN
THIS PLANT BRINGS THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE…
BUT YOU MUST PAY THE PRICE
Our hunt will take place in the Birch Pass.
We will begin the hunt in these two areas.
The Chupajin soldiers will spread out,
guard the trails, and go after them.
We'll lure them out…
to here.
You want to lure them out to Pyesa-gun.
Do not forget.
We will only pretend to hunt them.
When hunting a tiger,
you should not go too slow or too fast.
If we're too fast,
it might end up attacking us.
All right. Let's go!
Let's go!
Begin!
Get a move on!
It's a tiger's paw print.
It's odd though.
Tigers hate the sound of gongs, so they usually move away from it,
but not this one.
What do you mean?
It's moving towards the hunters.
It's a tiger.
It's not a tiger…
It's a monster.
Tell the hunters to fall back.
We'll take it from here.
Retreat!
-Move it! -Retreat!
It's the Pajeowi. Stop them!
Sir!
How bizarre.
It was already dead.
How is this possible?
Here's what's really bizarre.
We were told that our brothers were killed by a tiger.
Then where are their flesh and bones?
They crossed the borders and entered Pyesa-gun,
They crossed the borders and entered Pyesa-gun, which is against the law.
There is no reason for us to be held responsible for their deaths.
Our brothers died on Joseon soil.
Brace yourselves for a bloody revenge.
Ashin?
Fire!
JOSEON MILITARY CAMP, CHUPAJIN
I heard about the tragic massacre in your village.
Are you the only one who survived?
What happened to your father?
I heard the Pajeowi…
have executed a spy from Joseon.
Did you cross the river and go all the way there?
I do not get it.
Why would the Pajeowi do this to us?
I have been racking my brain, but I really do not get it.
Have you come to see me to find out why?
No.
That is not important.
Please avenge my father's death.
A lowborn weakling like me cannot do it.
But Joseon is a strong country
and has the power to punish them.
I am sorry for your loss,
but this is not a matter Joseon can intervene in.
My father…
was loyal to Joseon all his life.
Although you could not have him appointed officially…
you could at least do this for him.
It doesn't have to be right away.
Next year… No, the following year…
or even a decade or two later.
Make them shed tears of blood…
then I will make peace with it.
I will do anything.
I will be your spy
or even work as a butcher if you tell me to.
I will gladly do anything even if it's something worse than that.
Please avenge my father's death.
Take this child.
It looks like a Jurchen girl.
This is where you will stay.
I heard she is a survivor from the boundary village.
That tenacious little wench.
I heard she buried all the bodies by herself.
PAJEOWI MILITARY CAMP
-Hey. -What?
What are you looking at?
Ashin.
Get out.
Do you think
you can survive here…
after killing a Joseon soldier?
I guess you're too big to fit in here now.
Good job.
MESSENGER
It's an urgent message!
The peace conference with the Japanese was called off?
Yes, sir.
His Majesty has ordered every troop
to assemble in the south except those in Uiju and Kanggye.
We will leave a few soldiers behind and prepare for battle.
Yes, sir.
But keep a close watch on the Pajeowi's every move.
Yes, sir.
Sir.
What atrocity is this?
Please forgive me.
If this happens again,
I will not let it go unpunished.
I will remember that, sir.
I need you to cross the river again.
You need to find out in detail what the Pajeowi are up to.
PAJEOWI MAIN MILITARY BASE
Open your mouth.
Open up.
You should live a long life.
SPY WHO BETRAYED HIS OWN TRIBE
Dad…
Dad, it's me.
Dad…
It's me, Dad…
Please…
Kill me…
Dad.
Dad, let's…
Let's go home.
It's okay.
Everything will be okay, so let's go home.
Let's go back together.
Kill me.
No more…
Just kill me.
Let's go back.
Please…
Kill me now.
Ashin.
Ashin.
COMMANDER'S OFFICE, CHUPAJIN
Ashin?
Some Pajeowi Jurchens sneaked into Pyesa-gun to steal ginseng.
All of them were attacked and killed.
A war with Pajeowi Jurchens seemed imminent due to growing tensions,
but we wiped out a seongjeoyain village
and managed to prevent such a disaster.
Our brothers died on Joseon soil.
Brace yourselves for a bloody revenge.
Stop.
Even if you kill us now,
our brothers will come after you.
And you'll have a bigger price to pay.
You are right.
Your brothers were not killed by a tiger.
They were attacked.
We found this
where your brothers were killed.
Have you come to see me to find out why?
Please avenge my father's death.
Look after the family while I'm gone.
Ashin.
Ashin.
What is this flower?
What is that?
Beats me.
What's this? Help him up.
Help! Help me.
What the hell?
Gosh, it's cold.
It's so cold.
Is he dead?
Wait…
What the…
Get away from me!
Close the door! Hurry!
Is he dead?
What is that?
Get away from me!
Ashin…
Help me, Ashin.
No…
Ashin! What are you doing?
No, please! Don't kill me!
Ashin!
Ashin.
Don't kill me.
I'm sorry for everything.
Please spare me.
Ashin, you're back!
Yes.
I'm back.
You didn't eat anything again.
I told you that you have to eat.
I don't think I took proper care of you all this time.
Pheasants, deer, rabbits…
That's not what you wanted, after all.
From now on…
I'll provide you with only delicious meals.
Ashin!
Ashin!
Ashin!
Ashin, no!
Ashin!
How is it?
I am not lonely.
We are together, so I am not lonely.
When my job here is done,
after I kill every living thing on Joseon and Jurchen soil,
I will join you.
JOSEON BORDER, UIJU
I heard the Japanese attacked the south again.
What if they come all the way up here?
I heard the envoys left to request help from the Great Empire.
If they help us, we won't be overrun like last time.
The envoys are here!
Can this plant…
PHYSICIAN LEE SEUNG-HUI
…really bring back the dead?
Yes, that is correct.
Before the nervous system rots,
mash the plant and put it on an acupuncture needle…
and pierce the needle one pun deep into the glabellar.
Kattunayakan means "Kings of the forest."
This is my home, where I belong, where the wild animals roam free.
This is also the land where my ancestors lived for generations.
Oh, my dear. Did you sleep, my child?
How are you?
Come, come here.
Come closer.
Come here, my dear.
Come, come here. Come closer.
Oh, my dear.
Raghu! My baby.
Come.
Hey, come.
Hey, lie down here.
Bomman. Bomman!
I am trying to light the fire!
I am not going to marry someone who's going to be covered with ash.
When I arrived, the baby elephant was in a very bad state.
He was in a lot of pain, his tail had been bitten off by stray dogs
and his open wounds were infested with maggots.
Raghu's mother got electrocuted and died instantly.
Due to a prolonged drought,
his herd had wandered into a village in search of food and water.
They tried to reunite Raghu with his herd, but they were not successful.
Before this baby elephant, I wasn't officially a caretaker.
When I first met the baby,
he was tugging at my clothes like a child, and I felt his love.
I decided I would give this motherless baby a chance.
I am very happy that the Forest Department assigned Bellie
to work with me to care for Raghu.
She is the only woman currently assigned
to care for baby elephants in Tamil Nadu.
Look over there beneath the tree, there it is.
There is one more walking down there.
When Raghu arrived here, he was in bad shape.
Everyone thought he wouldn't survive,
but that is what gave me faith that he would.
No one knew if Raghu would even survive.
He was in such a bad state.
It was a long and difficult process to cure Raghu.
But now it feels great to see him healthy.
We've been looking after our baby Raghu for almost three years now.
This place is an elephant rehabilitation camp.
Orphaned, abandoned and displaced wild elephants are brought here.
And we take care of them.
My grandfather looked after elephants, my father looked after elephants,
and I became an elephant caregiver the day my father died.
Raghu! I've been looking for your bell. How did you lose it?
You dropped it in the water?
Luckily, I found it in the river!
Don't lose it again!
They wear a bell
so we can hear them if they get lost in the forest
because we would lose them and they will not be able to fend for themselves.
Raghu has a friend called Krishna.
Look, Raghu is going over to Krishna!
Raghu can't pluck grass on his own, and is learning from Krishna.
Raghu got a thorn stuck on his tongue, and Krishna took it out.
Elephants are meant to be wild.
Watching him with Krishna brings us much happiness.
There is only so much we can teach them,
and there are things they can only learn from one of their own kind.
Are you eating soap? Haven't you tasted soap before?
Hey! You are putting water on me. Don't splash like that!
Oh, my dear.
Who is it?
What do you want?
Oh, my dear child.
Who is the best elephant? Is it you?
Oh, whose darling is this? Who is this?
We have become a family around Raghu and we think that's why he survived.
While bringing up Raghu, we forget about all our other worries.
I have experienced many losses in my life.
My ex-husband was killed by a tiger.
This left me feeling scared of the forests.
I get scared when I see a tiger.
I am a tribal woman, and our people come from the heart of the forest.
For us Kattunayakans, the well-being of the forest is all that matters.
We walk barefoot within it.
This is our way of showing respect.
We're going to climb down that rock there…
We live off the forest, but we also protect it.
We only take what we need.
Our people do not fear elephants,
that's why we've been working with them for generations.
I have learned over the many years of working with elephants
that they are very intelligent and emotional beings.
But working with elephants is dangerous in so many ways.
I got stabbed by my big tusker a while ago.
I cannot work with large elephants anymore.
There it is. Open it!
That is why I feel getting Raghu
was a gift from God.
I want to do my best for him.
I feel like I am his mother.
Drink from here…
Everything about him is like a human,
except that he cannot talk. He does everything else.
Recently, my daughter died.
Losing a child… the pain is incomparable.
When I cried, Raghu wiped my tears away with his trunk.
And this small gesture comforted me.
I feel he really understands everything.
I remember what my daughter was like at Raghu's age.
Taking care of Raghu reminds me of taking care of my own daughter in so many ways.
It's like she has come back into my life.
Look how naughty you are today.
See how naughty you are.
Bring all the sugarcane here.
I don't think he wants the millet ball today.
But we have to first give him the millet.
If you give it to him like that, he will eat it.
He has his eyes on that dried coconut and jaggery.
I really don't like your habit of putting your hand in the bucket!
He's not going to eat any more because he's only looking at that coconut.
This is what he was like when he was young,
both of us had to take turns to feed him, only then he'd eat.
Come here, try to feed him, he isn't eating.
Aye, why aren't you eating, naughty boy?
Why didn't you eat properly when she was feeding you?
The rains have come. This will make the grass grow for you.
Raghu will get so much grass to eat.
Come.
Raghu, come here under the umbrella.
Tomorrow when I receive my salary, I'll go buy some fruits.
You feed me and I'll feed you.
What if while I am feeding you, you bite my fingers?
Don't talk like that.
Raghu, my child.
Wait, I will give you some, I am coming.
I am so full.
Let's light the fire and bring the water to boil.
He is sleepy.
Wait, it is almost ready!
Don't try to pull the tube, it will break.
Are you sleepy?
Stand still! Are you trying to eat the garland?
Stop eating all the flowers!
Let go of them!
On a special ceremony day,
elephant calves are taken to seek their blessings
from Lord Ganesha.
I am proud of being both a priest and a mahout,
both bring me immense happiness.
We pray to Lord Ganesha.
Seeing an elephant, to us, is equivalent to seeing God.
God and elephants are one for me.
The way I serve God is the same way I serve the elephants.
We take care of Raghu every single day,
which in turn puts food on my table every day.
This is God's presence in my life.
Without him, we'd have nothing.
Early morning, 5am, Bomman got a call.
The Forest Department asked me to come to the camp immediately.
When I went to see it, it was a tiny thing with a snotty trunk.
The camp managers said we have to take charge of baby Ammu.
They said, despite everyone else's efforts,
all the other elephant babies died.
"You successfully managed to raise Raghu."
For a whole week, Raghu was very upset.
If Ammu was standing close to us, he would come and push her away
so that he could stand beside us.
Slowly, he got used to Ammu's presence.
Hey, wait.
Now, we are all a family.
By working together with Bomman,
the bond between us has grown so much.
Look at all of you dancing without me. Here I come.
Come! My dear ones, run and come!
Run a little faster to me. Come!
Hey, stop eating the flowers!
Sanjana is my granddaughter.
Ama, I'll wear that dress!
She loves me so much and helps me in everything.
Sanjana has always loved elephants very much.
Even now, as she is growing up, she loves them.
I take Sanjana along with me to help take care of the elephants.
I want her to learn from me.
We are their parents.
We do whatever it takes to provide for them in all their needs.
Looking after two elephants means giving them milk,
cleaning out their room, bathing them…
Alongside all the hard work and care,
elephants also require a lot of love and affection.
It's just like raising human babies.
-Hey. -Take it.
The cup is empty now!
Water.
Sanjana, let me tell you a story.
Three blind men went to the jungle and they came across an elephant.
One of them touched the trunk and said it felt like a serpent.
Another touched the ear and said, "It's a sieve!"
The third touched the tail and said, "It's a broom!"
In the same way,
many believe that elephants are dangerous and they raid crops.
But only people who live close to elephants
know about elephants.
That they show love when you show love.
Just like Ammu and Raghu.
Shortly after our wedding, we got a call from the Forest Department,
telling us Raghu would be assigned to another caregiver.
We begged the forest rangers not to take Raghu away from us.
Raghu hesitated a lot while being taken away.
He kept turning around, looking back at us and Ammu,
and walked very slowly.
Then Ammu cried out to him and he came running back to touch her
and they came back to take him away again.
My wife and I couldn't even eat properly for a few days.
We had put in everything into raising Raghu.
We've been through so much.
There wasn't a single God left who we didn't pray to.
After all the difficulties we faced in raising Raghu,
it brings tears to my eyes.
No.
I feel the same intense pain I felt when my daughter died.
I took as much care of him as if he had been my own child
because I had to ensure his survival.
We love them so much.
We have brought them up
as our own children.
It was so painful for us and also Ammu.
Ammu was very upset and didn't even drink her milk for a few days,
because she was separated from Raghu.
What are you searching for?
I don't have any.
Lie down here.
If you lie on me then you will get a spanking.
Lie down here.
Ammu. Do you want your milk?
What?
Do you want milk?
Leave me, let me go and prepare milk.
From being scared of the forest,
now I'm not.
I had so much loss and sadness,
but now I've found my way through it. I've found my voice.
I have raised two baby elephants.
Now everyone knows me as the mother of elephants
and that makes me very proud.
It is the actions of us humans
that is causing elephants to enter villages these days.
Our mistakes are very harmful, both for us and for elephants.
We were able to save Raghu and Ammu because they were brought to us.
Baby Ammu!
But we are not able to save all of them.
Every time I see Raghu, I feel great joy.
Even today he still comes running to me when I call.
Aye, here, come to me, come!
I see the love he has for me, and I feel love for him too.
This is me when I was a young boy.
These children are our future.
We want the younger generation to learn from us.
They learn by watching and helping us work.
After me, this younger generation will carry on the tradition
Angèle!
Angèle…
It happened so fast.
And it was so intense.
Angèle, will you marry me?
It feels good to put it into words.
DIARY
I'M SUFFOCATING
FAKE
SUCCESS?
To be able to tell the story the way I experienced it.
Damn. I always look terrible whenever I use this camera.
And no one will ever be able to tell it better than I can.
No one's ever ready for this.
When I ended up being on every show overnight,
I was super happy…
LIFE IS COOL!!
…but I also thought, "Why am I here?" "Why me?!"
I created this girl.
An improved version of myself. A combination of my fantasies.
The Little Mermaid.
A princess.
Hélène Ségara.
Priscilla. Ariana Grande.
All those I secretly wished I looked like.
Here's the thing,
I have lost the real Angèle.
LOST
I don't know who I am.
WHO I AM
1. WHO IS ANGÈLE?
BRUSSELS, BELGIUM
Citizens are to stay at home
in order to avoid any kind of physical contact
outside their close family circle.
All gatherings are forbidden.
Lockdown, day one.
Today is March 14, 2020.
Not sure what the weeks to come will look like.
We're under lockdown
Since I have nothing to do, I'm experimenting.
Lockdown, day five.
I feel like it's been two years since I last wrote something.
Today is March 19. This is going to feel like forever.
I'm sick of being
under… lock… down…
At first, I didn't want to make music.
"I shouldn't be working. I'm on a break."
I've built a kind of shelter for myself.
With a hi-fi system and everything. The DIY way.
And that's when I wrote a lot of stuff.
Why does it sound like this?
Why is it so saturated?
Brussels, I love you
APRIL 20, 2020
You're the most beautiful
And you gave back to me
Paris…
I started thinking about another album during lockdown.
I hadn't before. I was busy touring, promoting myself.
I had no other choice but to tell myself,
"What do we do now?"
I was lucky that my first album became a success.
But I was 20 when I wrote it. Now I'm 25.
My life has changed a lot in five years. I've experienced a lot.
I can't keep singing about the same things.
I don't like it. It's annoying.
I'm expected to be as successful.
It's natural to feel pressure,
but I think I'll go someplace else and try something more personal.
I don't know where this will take me.
WHO IS ANGÈLE?
I forgot what it was like to be on my own with my piano.
Asking myself questions like,
"What do I want to talk about, sing about?"
LOCKDOWN - DAY 36
One time
Never give it up
Two times
For all the love I got
Three for you
Where are you?
If the pandemic hadn't happened,
I probably would have been traveling, partying…
I wouldn't have confronted these fears
in such a direct way had I been able to avoid them.
Pepette.
The chamber of secrets.
I have so much brol.
BROL - MASCULINE (BELGIUM) MESS, CHAOS
I mean, real brol.
There may be the notebook of secrets.
I don't have my notebook?
Pepette is stuck.
Why did you write
Everything down in notebooks
Of secrets
One notebook of secrets.
ONE LIFE
WHO IS ANGÈLE?
I write a lot because I need to… write.
That's why I write songs.
I've always written in diaries. I have so many of them.
This is really the beginning.
I didn't have any songs yet.
It's crazy how much lousy stuff I wrote.
I used to write awful lyrics.
"Online and connected, but not to me. Waiting for a sign."
The first lyrics to "Je veux tes yeux."
The top-line was different.
Online and connected, but not to me Waiting for a sign, there's none
Online and connected, but not to me
Waiting for a sign, there's none
Good thing I changed the top-line.
WRITTEN AT 23
"It's late. I'm in my Paris apartment. I feel like reading old notes."
"Don't know who I am anymore."
WHO I AM
"I work more than I breathe."
"I'm suffocating."
"What makes me happy? Success?"
"THE 350,000 FOLLOWERS?"
ANGELE_VL 3M FOLLOWERS
"The 10 millions views
on "La loi de Murphy?"
"What makes me happy is fake."
"Me, my image. Nailing it."
"Me, myself and the singer Angèle."
"Everything else is pointless. I'm ashamed of it."
"I feel a void when I get home
because I realize that this is all pointless,
fake, impalpable."
"I used to be alive. Full of doubts, questions, desires."
"Now success is my only desire."
"I run away from everything else. I used to be free."
There you go. Crazy.
I USED TO BE FREE
I wouldn't trade my life for the one I used to have.
Even if I could.
What's happening to me is beautiful.
I worked hard for it. It's what I've always wanted.
2. REAL LIFE
I'll be one of those other women
Those who give you pleasure
Your games will be ours
If that's what you wish for
I'll shine brighter
To rekindle the flame
I'll turn into gold
To make you love me…
-Hello? -Yes, hello.
Hi, Mom.
We could meet on Sunday night.
Yes, I'll be there.
We'll have fries, for a change.
-Take care. See you on Sunday. -I love you, Mom.
-I love you, dear. Bye. -Yeah. Bye.
Look. When I was a kid, this was a tower.
That was like the World Trade Center to me.
I never knew what it was for.
That was my elementary school.
We're going back to see my school.
It's amazing
to be here.
To find myself here.
Crocodiles!
I must've spent five years of my life waiting for the bus here.
My parents used to be a bit late.
97-98
So we're arriving
in Linkebeek.
I put a sweater on Pepette so that she'll match my outfit.
She's so cute.
It's so beautiful here.
You get bored very quickly though.
We're literally in the middle of nowhere. That's home.
Let's go see Grandma.
Pepette! My little darling.
Hey, there.
I'm filming.
Hello, you cutie.
Hey.
Have you seen the stuff there?
Yo! She's Laurence Bibot and you are Angèle Van Laeken. Yeah!
How are you?
Yes, very well.
-Is that Spritz? -No, that's grenadine.
Angèle?
-What? -How are you?
Yes, I'm fine.
WRITTEN AT 13
"I'm young. I have amazing friends."
"I love my school. My parents, my brother are great."
"I love music, I love parties."
"I love piano."
"I love candy."
"Playing, screaming, dancing. Dancing like no one's watching."
"I love singing. Old American movies. I love Audrey Hepburn."
"If I were to keep explaining why I'm happy today, for no reason
I'm going to start crying."
"That's real life."
-All the shows. -That's funny.
The good old days.
"Bravo, Martine."
October 26, 1996. I was one year old.
Less than that.
She was on stage when I was ten months old.
That's the time you had…
-When I fainted? -You had breath-holding attack.
Right.
That was you asserting your shitty temper.
Exactly.
But look at me today.
Look at that, honey.
Baby.
You're the newborn, miss, aren't you?
Who's that, Roméo? Your little sister, what's her name?
-Angelo. -No, Angèle.
-Yes, Angèle. -She's not a boy.
Names have a story for us.
With Roméo, we went quite far already.
We picked Roméo… Johnny. Always a good thing.
Elvis. And Kiki.
When I fell pregnant,
I didn't know the gender.
Though I believed it'd be a girl. That's what I wanted.
So, yes, I wanted to go for legendary names again.
I was thinking about the women that made history.
Cleopatra was a little too much.
Joséphine would've been the middle name because of Joséphine Baker.
We decided… I mean, I decided.
That'd be more honest. I went for Angèle.
She was an amazing toddler. A gorgeous little girl.
She never had an awkward phase.
I did some modeling.
I saw some very beautiful girls.
And I saw how sad they were.
I thought, "That's strange. Isn't beauty more of a curse?"
So I told Angèle,
when she was four or five,
"Listen. You're very pretty."
We were in the car.
"You're very pretty."
"But that won't be enough."
"You're pretty. We know. But work on something else."
THE MOTHER
You seen your mother?
It goes out the other way.
Know what he said?
"Go wash your butt, you slut."
Laurence Bibot.
Also known as Marinette.
I grew up with famous parents.
My mother is an actress.
My father is a singer.
So fame, to me,
has always been something I knew about.
It wasn't new.
Both my parents were artists. They were very creative.
They were on stage, in the spotlights.
They were inspiring, funny.
They knew how to take up space.
Maybe too much sometimes.
My brother and I were lucky to experience this.
Even though they were only popular in Belgium,
this was quite unpretentious,
we still felt like we grew up in their shadow.
DIARY
CAUTION NARCISSISTIC PERSON
DON'T TAKE THIS BIG FLAW INTO CONSIDERATION
Look at that.
That's interesting. Bit sad.
"Every time I mention my parents, people can't help but mention their job."
"You listen to him on the radio? Is your mom still funny?"
"Do your parents record themselves? I saw your mom on TV. She rocks."
"I don't care."
"I'm… currently… saying… they're impossible."
"People don't see me. I'm just their daughter."
Crazy. May 1, 2011.
I'M JUST THEIR DAUGHTER
Go play out there.
The kids suffered from our fame. We didn't realize that.
They were "the son and daughter of."
When we were running errands at the supermarket,
people would come to us.
For the kids, I…
They once told us it wasn't always easy. We didn't realize it.
We do now.
Now that it's the other way around.
We aren't…
Sometimes, I…
I'm just "the father of."
THE FATHER OF
Brussels is coming!
It must have been something for my father.
A "wow" feeling.
Just like me when I saw my sister nailing it
while I was in it too, making a name for myself.
Imagine what it's like for my dad. He's almost 60.
And his kids…
Let's start with me. I was doing my thing.
He was like… It blew his mind.
"How many views this week?"
I said, "10,000 views."
"That's crazy." He was shocked.
THE RAPPER BROTHER
SISTER OF
DAUGHTER OF
They became "the parents of." That's crazy.
They became the parents of.
I still spend time apologizing for being here.
But…
I was just looking for recognition.
As a person.
As an individual,
independently of my parents.
Good. Hold on, I'm not sure.
When I was playing music,
I could feel I was worth something. I had something to say.
Fortunately, Ania, my piano teacher, saw that I had something right away.
So she encouraged me.
People would ask who was playing the piano. "Angèle is."
I could feel I was worthy again.
That made me feel valuable.
But I couldn't play in my room by myself.
If people were too busy, I couldn't play too loud.
I couldn't sing too loud.
I didn't want to draw attention.
So I also learned how to play softly.
And sing very softly.
That's good.
My father was demanding since that was his job.
If I played piano,
he'd often say,
"You need to work on it more."
He would think I wasn't diligent enough.
A…
D…
Let's do it together.
We couldn't play just like that… It wasn't just a hobby.
"Why is my father so…
first, annoying…"
"Then, why does he want me to be a professional musician?"
"It's his job. That doesn't mean it should be mine."
Go on.
"Music requires way more work."
"I'm sorry, Marka."
"I don't like music as much as you do."
"I love piano. I do."
"But it'll never be my job."
"I love piano. I do."
"But it'll never be my job."
You read that right. "It'll never be my job."
Crazy.
3. MY PLACE
BRUSSELS 2 FIRST VERSE OKAY
I owe my name to you
Brussels, I love you Brussels, I love you
I missed you
Dammit.
That's it.
It's not that hard.
BRUSSELS ILY
The lockdown wasn't easy.
Not for anyone.
I lived in different places.
I was stuck in Paris for a while.
Fuck.
Two.
Is it interesting?
Hold on.
I love Paris. It's beautiful. There's everything you need.
But it's not home.
I wanted to write a love letter to the city in which I grew up.
Brussels, I love you
Brussels, I love you You're my favorite
Brussels, I love you Brussels, I love you
It's those little things, simple and personal things,
It's those little things, simple and personal things, that governed the second album.
It might not be as universal as the first one.
It's not going to change the world, but it's as sincere and close to who I am.
I think.
I think that making music for me,
since it was my dad's job,
couldn't be just a pastime.
At the same time, I didn't want it to become professional.
I was stuck in-between.
I could tell I was talented and that I liked it,
but I didn't want to push it further. I didn't want to do my dad's job.
I thought it was a difficult job.
Even harmful to his mental health.
That's how I'd sum it up.
TAKE THE A TRAIN
I was against smartphones.
I had a Nokia.
I didn't have Snapchat, Instagram.
Just Facebook.
A good friend of mine told me,
"You're going to love Instagram." I was like, "Me, love it?"
I said, "No, thanks. I'm not interested in drawing that attention."
I signed up to Instagram.
Since I was studying music,
I thought I could use it to make music.
There's just one thing That's getting in the way
You know I hate sleeping alone
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly
Then I started singing
and recording videos.
To avoid criticism,
I was making jokes.
It was easier to laugh about it and put costumes on.
To just make funny faces.
It let people know I wasn't taking myself seriously.
Thanks, bye.
I'm not confident, but I have no followers.
There's nothing at stake.
Only my friend who signed me up. A few friends.
Some of them find out I sing. They're surprised.
My childhood friends find out I sing.
But that was it at first.
I remember very well
a few of the first reactions I got.
I remember Sylvie's.
I CALL SHOTGUN ON THE MANAGER POSITION!
I know Angèle well, yes.
I have known her for 21 years. Yeah.
We attended the same school. We lived close to each other.
I used to look after Angèle's class in kindergarten.
When I was 16, I babysat her.
When I was 16, I babysat her. When I wasn't old enough, her parents would drop her at mine when on tour.
When I wasn't old enough, her parents would drop her at mine when on tour.
I first saw Angèle on Instagram
in her first video.
I posted a comment as a joke.
I said, "Shotgun on the manager position." That's it.
At that time, I knew she was just having fun.
But she could sing. She had personality. There was something.
It wasn't my job, but why not give it a try.
I was thirsty for projects back then. I wanted to do lots of things.
I felt that Angèle had a huge potential.
I did make her leave her room
to perform in bars.
She was quite hesitant.
"What are we doing?"
I'd say, "Close your eyes. Trust me."
We started off like this.
Give me the tape.
I'm sending the video to myself.
What is it like to hang out with a kid?
I makes me feel so mature.
I'm always on my knees.
Angèle nicknamed me "Daring Sylvie."
It does suit me well.
Angèle is the scared one. She doesn't dare to do things.
I want to smash doors open.
"Daring Sylvie" it is then. Nice to meet you.
THE MANAGER
MARCH 7, 2016
Tonight, I sing your song
I was where I was supposed to be. I felt good.
I thought, "Music is my place."
I was so scared of failure.
With a singer as a father, an actress as a mother,
I felt the need to prove that I wasn't the little girl.
I didn't talk about it…
I didn't want their help or draw their interest.
I'd have been ashamed if I failed.
Sylvie believed in it.
She'd say, "It'll be amazing." I didn't believe in it.
Sylvie was thinking about shows at the Archiduc,
a famous jazz bar in Brussels.
I was studying jazz music. I was having a hard time fitting in.
Asking myself if I deserved it. I was still learning.
I did that show, and it was sold out.
I met Nicolas, my second manager, there.
It happened thanks to Sylvie.
Sylvie got me out of my room.
She got me out of my family home.
I FUCKING LOVE MY LIFE FUCK
ARCHIDUC
EXCITEMENT OF THE DAY
Nicolas got a call.
Damso's team were looking for someone to play keyboards.
And…
Not sure how come my name
was miraculously mentioned.
I don't know how come
it came to me opening the show.
I got a call
from Damso's tour producer,
asking if Angèle was interested in playing keyboards on Damso's tour.
That was a surprising request.
"That would be cool, but can't she open the show too?"
I didn't realize what I was saying as I said it.
I wasn't visualizing
what it'd be like to have her open for Damso.
With his audience.
Damso didn't want a rapper to open the show.
He didn't know my songs. They hadn't been released.
He hadn't heard any of my songs.
He'd only heard my piano cover of "Bruxelles."
Brussels, my beautiful
I'll meet you soon
As soon as Paris…
He thought that cover was great.
He thought, "All right. It's going to work out."
At the time, Damso…
He had a huge influence.
And everything he touched could potentially turn to gold.
When she asked me, no matter how much I loved Damso,
I said, "No, you're insane."
"His audience isn't ready. They won't give you a chance."
DRESSING ROOM - ANGÈLE
I'm offered this improbable thing,
even though at the time I wasn't into rap music.
I was into the whole jazz thing.
I was starting music, but I wasn't into that.
"Why me? What does it have to do with me?"
"What do I have to lose?"
It was a real debate.
My mother said, "Go for it. Nothing to lose."
That was true. At that time, I didn't.
STRASBOURG OCTOBER 5, 2017
FIRST SHOW
Come on!
I'm backstage. I hear that the crowd is already psyched up.
The lights go off.
Back on and I walk on stage.
I get booed straight away.
2,000 people booing.
They're booing me as if I wasn't welcome there at all.
I remember I took my phone out
to film.
I can hear people starting to scream.
We realize that people are not enjoying themselves.
They're booing. Like…
They're calling her names. We were like, "Fuck."
Nico and I looked at each other and said, "What were we thinking?"
"Why did we do that?"
"We're going to destroy her. Her confidence will be crushed."
Damso walks in.
He didn't see anything.
People start cheering him. I'm playing like…
Thinking, "What the hell was that?"
I think… it was tough.
I didn't realize.
I was doing my thing.
Later on, I learned that it had been touchy.
Give it up for Angèle.
They thought I was crazy for doing this…
If I like someone, I go for it.
It came naturally.
I didn't think I would break the codes… I'm not.
I'm just going for someone whose soul and energy I like.
I'm just going for someone whose soul and energy I like. So let's just do it. You know?
I posted something on Instagram, asking people to support her.
Because it's hard indeed.
YOU CAN'T SEE HER WELL BUT SHE'S GOING TO NAIL IT
We're headed home.
The mood is quite low.
Sylvie falls asleep.
I'm in bed, staring at the ceiling. I can still hear people shouting.
"Is it going to be like this for three months?"
I start thinking,
"How am I going to handle it?"
I don't want to see it as a failure.
That would be the worst for me.
At the same time, I don't know how to avoid
having to face such vehemence.
To face an audience who doesn't want me there.
SECOND SHOW
How do you feel?
The usual. I'm nervous. But it needs to be done.
-What did you do before? -I pooped.
She's a bit tired.
Where's Angèle?
She's here.
I get on stage.
Not sure what was going through my head then,
but I started to feel determined.
At least, it felt like it.
Deep down, I wasn't confident at all.
I thought, "Let's do it another way."
I don't want to give people the chance to let me know they're unhappy.
Let's go.
Good evening! How are you?
Are you ready?
Yeah!
My name's Angèle. I'm glad to be here tonight.
Thank you, Damso, for inviting me.
They're happy.
Angèle!
One time
Two times
Three for you Against all odds, people just started saying my name.
Against all odds, people just started saying my name.
Just shouting my name.
Angèle! Go Angèle!
It was a bit of a joke too.
People didn't expect to see me on stage, so it needed to become a joke.
We were complete opposites, so it was just funny to do that.
I think I managed to make the most of this absurdity.
He had nothing to gain from supporting me, giving me visibility.
He did it for the love of music.
Because he loved what I was doing.
What's crazy is that it continued later on.
We're working on new projects.
It's great that we've made this thing last.
I've learned a lot with him. It helped me afterwards.
I was more driven after that.
I also felt like I've always had to prove something when I was on stage.
Suddenly, I couldn't do anything but just own up to it. No cheating.
And no seeking to please.
One time, never give it up
Two times, for all the love I got
Three for you
I started writing on my own.
From then on, I started to feel
more fulfilled with my music because it felt like me.
I'd think of something and I knew how to make it.
This young woman is going viral
both in French-speaking and Dutch-speaking regions.
Her name is Angèle. Her song's called "La loi de Murphy."
Angèle, "La loi de Murphy."
Yeah!
A crazy live set.
My God.
One time, never give it up
What happened was great.
I couldn't have imagined
it would work out this fast.
We knew nothing about how to promote an album.
We didn't plan anything.
We weren't ready at all.
We published the video.
I had no record label.
I didn't have a lot of resources. We were independent.
And millions of people reacted to it.
I saw this happen
from my small Brussels apartment.
I don't know what's going on. I see the comments.
I can feel it becoming a thing.
I think to myself, "I may have made a huge mistake."
"It may be getting out of hand."
4. HAPPY?
I'm very scared, because emails… At what time did I sent this?
Okay. 5:20 p.m.
"Hi. Sylvie, I'd like to apologize for my crisis."
"I know you're working hard. I don't want to blame you for my fears."
I could send this anytime…
"You both need to know
who I really am."
"On stage, I try to put on a front."
"I'm doing it because this is a huge opportunity."
"It opens doors."
"All of this is amazing."
"But this is for the ANGÈLE project."
ANGÈLE
"When I say I can't complain, it's true."
"It wouldn't make sense to do so when we couldn't have hoped for better."
"But how come I haven't been able to sleep for a month
and that I've been having panic attacks and crying five times a day?"
"I'm just sensitive and anxious."
"I can't separate the personal from the professional."
"The project's called Angèle. I need to face the consequences."
ANGÈLE
"What's happening scares me."
"I think no one knows because it's too amazing to be scary."
"But since last Monday,
my real face is on YouTube."
"It's really me. I wanted that too."
"I'm starting to look back on what's been happening."
"I'm starting to get messages and offers."
"I have to face that alone."
"If it doesn't work out, that would've been my failure."
"I don't want to be a diva,
saying no one can understand me,
but I mean what I'm saying."
"I'm freaking out. I'm having panic attacks again."
"I know it's not going to change and might get even worse,
but if you could understand where this is coming from, it'd be great."
"I want to thank you for what you're doing."
"I don't say it enough. I mean it."
That's crazy.
Well…
That's crazy because I could have written this a week ago.
Well, that's reassuring. I'm true to myself.
At the same time, it's reminiscent of a strange period.
It's true, when "La loi de Murphy" came out,
I wasn't having a good time. Yet, it was the beginning of everything.
There was this moment when I was being very carefree.
I was doing music, but I could go out.
I could party with my friends, while still doing music.
I was having a blast.
But then, suddenly, the song is released.
People react to it. I get the first messages and reviews.
So, all of a sudden, I have to face something violent.
You get direct feedback from millions of people.
At home, by myself wearing pajamas. Greasy hair.
Uncleaned teeth.
You're facing your screen, and you see thousands of views,
and thousands of people all around you.
You're paranoid.
The day "La loi de Murphy" came out, I was feeling paranoid.
I felt like everyone was watching me.
Even though no one cared.
I just kept crying after that. I'd cry all day at that time.
I was scared.
I thought, "What am I getting into?"
Maybe I was that scared
because deep down I knew
that I wouldn't let this go.
That it was what I had wished for.
I wanted this to happen.
But there was a part of me that was like,
"What's going to happen?"
ANGÈLE, HEAVEN-SENT ANTI-MUSE
Playboy gets in touch. They want to improve their image.
I know about the magazine.
They want to feature a portrait of me.
The next issue will be
focusing on feminism,
on women's voices.
And it won't be sexual.
I'm having second thoughts, but I agree.
It could be interesting to talk about my music.
It's at odds with what they do.
And things may change.
The interview went well.
The day I saw the magazine,
I was surprised at first.
I thought what they said
was unfaithful.
What's more, the photo that they chose…
We had shot it a few months earlier.
We had decided not to publish it
because I was young, blonde with red lips,
and I was pouting.
We thought it was too seductive.
I was scared at that time to be sexualized against my will.
I wasn't comfortable with that picture.
They were interested in this picture.
I had forbidden them to use it. I knew it'd be misinterpreted.
I discover when I open the magazine
that they used it even though I had said no.
The real trauma was the day after.
Belgian tabloids publish this picture too
with the title…
"Laurence and Marka's daughter naked for Playboy."
All my fears combined.
That is to say, being "the daughter of, the sister of"
and in a sexual context.
My worst nightmare.
I felt humiliated.
At that time, I was just starting to get confident.
I had started my own record label, my publishing company.
I was independent. No longer living with my family.
I had managed to do it on my own. Write and play songs…
I was starting to tell myself
I could do it on my own.
With that first article,
it came down to me just being a girl.
A pretty blonde, who takes her clothes off for men
as the only way to get noticed.
VOICE MESSAGE SEPTEMBER 30, 2017
I'm sorry, yesterday…
in one of those magazines, they wrote the worst things about me.
"Laurence Bibot's and Marka's daughter naked for Playboy magazine."
I cried all day. I can't get over it. Looks like there's nothing I can do.
The world is an awful place where people want to sell me
and they use my image…
I'm 21.
I spend my life
trying to send good messages to people, write beautiful love songs…
I'm very careful about what I do, what I show,
and I want to be natural.
I hate this superficial world
where girls are sexual objects.
Now it's getting out of hand. I get caught in it.
The worst headlines
with my parents involved.
It's a public humiliation.
I don't feel well. I don't want to play. I don't want to do anything anymore.
After that came months of
controlling everything people would see.
I was very affected by this event.
I also felt determined afterwards.
I thought I would never be "the sister of," "the daughter of" again.
That's not who I am. I'm someone.
I work too hard to be associated to this.
What affected me
was to realize that even today,
even if it wasn't the image I wanted but that could've been the case,
a girl posing like that was seen as a negative.
That she should be ashamed. That it deserved to be in the papers.
Everyone only wants dough
That's the only thing that makes them hard
Everyone only wants fame
That's the only thing that moves them
What's the point then?
You're so lonely behind your screen
Thinking about what people will think
But they don't seem to care
It feels so weird to think that all these cars
are for me.
Like those guys… They're coming to my show. So weird.
Them too.
That man peeing over there… He's going to see me perform.
They know who I am
and their Saturday night
is devoted to my show.
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
five, four, three, two, one…
Happy new "Brol"!
That's it. "Brol" is out, friends.
Hey!
It's all for me
I'm very happy
We've been waiting for this album for a year.
It's finally out. It's already a success.
The tickets for the Olympia sold out in two hours.
Are you happy?
I am, but I don't realize.
Unlike everyone else.
AM I HAPPY?
-Are we there? -Yes.
Fuck.
Holy shit. No way.
We'll drive like…
Is it crowded?
This won't be possible.
No way.
No…
It never stops.
She's here!
It's hard to understand.
I need the people who listen to me.
At the same time, I find it unfair
that people love me that much but that I can't reciprocate.
Especially for someone who likes interactions.
I realize I can't really reciprocate
the love the audience sends my way.
I can reciprocate by doing a show,
by writing songs, but that's it.
I can't see every one of them
the way they see me.
It's unequal and frustrating.
Marry me!
I'm so sorry.
We have a train to catch.
We couldn't let you all in.
So I'm really sorry. But…
Angèle, will you marry me?
You're beautiful!
Angèle!
I'm so sorry. Thank you.
Angèle!
When will you be back?
No one behaves normally with me.
No relationship is normal anymore.
I remember this one festival.
We got off stage.
Lots of people wanted to take a picture with me.
It wasn't the right time. Unfortunately, I can't really lie.
I'm spontaneous.
If I'm sad, angry or not feeling well,
I can't pretend and put on a fake smile.
I said to the girls,
"I can't go and see them."
People started to call me names.
They completely lost it.
I remember one woman with her kids,
who shouted,
"Come on, grab her hair!"
The kids started pulling my hair.
I looked down,
and someone else said,
"You're a shitty star."
I do remember
not understanding how we got to this point.
Thinking, "What I am for them?"
"Am I just a star?"
Yes, I am. They don't know me.
They don't know I am a human being.
After that show, I'm going to poo like everyone else.
To them, I'm just a star.
So if they don't get a picture with me, it's disrespectful.
And in a way,
when you do music and you become famous, there's something tacit about it.
and you become famous, there's something tacit about it.
Now you belong to people.
LOST
EMPTY
FREE
WHO I AM
I'M IN A PROPER SHITTY SITUATION
…the party
Brussels, I love you
BRUSSELS, I LOVE U
Let's do the whole chorus.
It sounds great, right?
Small detail with "Brussels, I love you…"
Brussels, I…
Right.
Brussels, I love you
It's as you wish, but you need to choose.
Brussels, I love you
Is that sound better?
Brussels, I love you
Brussels, I love you
And now it's like…
Brussels, I love you
-That part… -Yeah.
Try…
Brussels, I love you
Yeah. That one is more natural.
It's all good.
Do it like this.
I'm attending the Cannes opening next week.
I have armpit hair.
I want to keep it. Just like that.
It's very long.
Actually,
I want to do it, but what's hard
is that people don't support it.
People tell me I can't do that.
I'm like… I can.
In real life, I wouldn't have shaved it.
Why would I do it for Cannes?
I'm all dressed up, but I don't want to have to do that.
I don't feel the need to shave.
Why would I do it?
I know I'll be lashed out at.
I don't want that either.
I don't want it to be about that.
I want people to talk about my performance.
Not about my outfit or my armpit hair.
Angèle! Down here!
Angèle!
I dream of freedom,
of setting myself free before I can be free on stage.
Of being confident, not paying attention to people's comments.
I dream of sunshine, showing my curves through my dress
without the redneck comments on the internet.
I dream of a man looking at me without judging or worrying.
Without wanting to possess me.
I dream of feeling pretty without Instagram to prove it.
I dream of dreaming.
They all talk like animals
Badmouth every pussy
It's 2018, not sure what you're thinking But I am more than an animal
I see that rap is all the rage The dirtier it is, the more success it has
Hey, it's time we break the codes
A girl should speak her mind
So let me sing to you
Go f… yourself
I won't be on the radio
Her song "Balance ton quoi," a reference to #MeToo,
has become a feminist anthem in just a few months.
So let me sing to you
Go fuck yourself
I wrote "Balance ton quoi" spontaneously after a guy bothered me in Brussels.
Women's voices were starting to be heard
and artists were committed to changing things.
I didn't think I had the legitimacy
to say anything about it,
but I understood that I had a voice.
People recognized themselves in this.
FROM BEYONCÉ TO ANGÈLE FEMINISM GOES POP
FEMINIST AND POP ICON IN THE NY TIMES
POST-#METOO FEMINIST ANTHEM
HOW DID IT BECOME A FEMINIST ANTHEM?
Is it clear?
When a girl says no…
I feel like most of the time, it means…
No.
No. Okay.
It's great if the song made some realize that there were issues to tackle.
But it spun out of control.
Even though I completely agreed with the claims
and I'm still committed today, I'm not sure that this was what I wanted.
Being that exposed.
Some people might see me as a know-it-all.
People would come up with things to blame me for.
Focus on Roméo Elvis.
He's involved in a case of sexual assault.
The singer was accused on Instagram
and he apologized.
He said he used his hands
in an inappropriate way.
He thought he was replying to an invitation.
As for the singer Angèle, his sister,
she was asked to snitch on her brother on social media.
RAT YOUR BROTHER OUT
#SNITCHONYOURDISGUSTINGBROTHER
ANGÈLE PARTNER IN CRIME SILENCE MEANS CONSENT
YOU DAMN FEMINIST GO HANG OUT WITH YOUR BROTHER
I barely left my house for three months.
It was an explosion in my heart, in my family.
Because just like anyone else,
I condemn what my brother did, of course.
It was so violent and saddening
to realize how much some people rejoiced over it.
Me, a feminist who spoke out.
As if I was responsible.
As if I had to pay too.
As if it wasn't hard enough already to hear about this.
To see my brother in this situation.
No.
On Twitter, people were asking me to react right away.
Or the battle I had been fighting wouldn't be meaningful.
I CONDEMN
IT'S ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT SINCE HE'S A RELATIVE
THERE NEEDS TO BE A CHANGE OF MINDSET
Sexist and sexual violence is so omnipresent
that sometimes I feel like we'll never make it.
Then I look around
and I realize that people can slowly evolve.
People can realize all this.
My song isn't going to change things,
but people growing more aware and speaking out will.
Be it my brother, my best friend, my colleague…
I'll always condemn what goes against my beliefs.
The way women are being treated
and the way we teach men how to behave with them
must change.
5. SHE
Good Lord…
She's great there too.
Besides, I never would have thought…
that she would have done…
-Is it modeling? -Yes.
My darling…
If your grandpa was still here,
he'd be proud.
Wonderful…
What a beautiful kid.
She's a real model.
You're the first person to see these.
-Really? -Yeah.
Grandma Pilou is not just anyone.
For sure.
GRANDMA PILOU
THE GRANDMOTHER
Grandma Pilou is my grandma. I'm very close to her.
She lives in a different world from mine.
She brings me back down to Earth
because she thinks my job is amazing, but she doesn't understand it.
Even though I did these things, I'll always stay her granddaughter.
It allows her to stay simple. Most importantly, honest with me.
What's new?
Tell me, Grandma, which do you prefer?
Lemon or sugar?
Lemon or sugar tart?
-Sugar. -All right. Yes.
No.
This won't do here, honey.
-Yes. -Put the cans away.
What do you think of my style?
It's a little special.
I don't really like it.
At least you're being honest.
-Yes. You're honest. -You asked what I think.
It's hard.
Dating back to the war…
24 YEARS OLD
I really want to write.
I'm getting used to not understanding my life,
but this time, that was unexpected.
Even though I had thought about it before. Several times.
SHE
SHE
IN LOVE
Angèle is the new big star.
Her new relationship will be disclosed.
You'll see in the video.
Look at it closely. We can't show just the picture.
Okay? So, look closely. Tomorrow's cover.
PARIS, NOVEMBER 18, 2019 ARM IN ARM - ISN'T LIFE GREAT?
She…
She said, "Don't tell Grandma."
"I'll tell her."
One night, she called me.
I knew already.
And, well, I was a little bit…
abrupt in the way I talked, probably.
-She said, "Grandma, how are you doing?" -"I'm fine."
Well, I'm starting to…
She said, "What's going on?"
"Nothing," I said.
-"I need to tell you something." -I said, "No. You don't."
"I know."
That's it.
The guy actually outed me.
He was the first person to say on the air that I was with a woman
even though it was complicated for me
to grasp it, to consider it.
It was intimate.
He did it,
even though… I mean, it could have…
caused problems in my family.
She would have liked
to give me more…
How should I put it?
More of an explanation about it.
I've always asked, "Why a woman?"
"Why a man?" she replied.
It may be because of my age.
There are so few LGBT role models
that I realized quite late that I was bi.
I was 23.
I couldn't keep lying to myself.
With my situation,
I didn't just have to face my family, their questions,
the fear of being rejected,
I also had to face people's opinion.
SHIT SHE'S A LESBIAN
I REALLY THINK THIS IS A DISEASE
EAT YOUR FUCKING RAINBOW
YUCK I'LL UNFOLLOW
The issue is my coming out was stolen from me.
It's great that young people can relate to gay public figures,
I would have liked to decide on the time and the way to do it.
There's a reason why people are scared of coming out.
Consequences can be brutal.
All that matters to me now
is for falling in love to be normalized.
No matter the gender.
A public figure's sexual orientation shouldn't be headline news.
It should be a fact.
When I was 15 or 16,  I would've liked to have more LGBT role models.
That way, I wouldn't have lied to myself.
Thinking of this calms me down.
YOUR QUEEN
If she only knew how you look at her
She would be scared
If she only knew how you think of her
She could harm you
But give her some time
It could allow you
To be together again
She's going to need time for sure
To forget about her bias
You would like her To be your queen tonight
But two queens together Is not really a thing
You would like her To be your queen tonight
You don't really care about kings It's not for you
You would like her To be your queen tonight
But two queens together Is not really a thing
You would like her To be your queen tonight
You don't really care about kings It's not for you
"I'm writing today because you helped me."
"'Brol' had just come out."
"We talked about it with friends."
"They loved 'Ta reine.'"
"I hadn't listened to it. I stayed quiet. The day went by."
"I listened to it once home. It's as though you talked to me."
"'Ta reine' had been written for me. It's narcissistic, but it felt amazing."
"For the first time in my life, I was attracted to someone."
"A girl in my class."
"If she knew how I looked at her,
she would have been scared."
"A physical, emotional roller coaster."
"The first time I felt something for someone."
"I knew it was happening, but I didn't get it."
"Honestly, I don't know who I am,
but I feel understood before I get to understand myself."
"For that, thank you."
6. THE NEW ERA
I always look terrible whenever I use this camera.
Maybe the hair.
So the other day,
I made…
I'm making tea. It's noisy.
I made Laetitia listen to the songs.
She's a friend. My press secretary in Belgium.
I made her listen to the songs. All good, and she's like…
"Not sure about the lyrics."
"Compared to 'Brol,' I feel excluded."
"I feel like this isn't as good."
That's not what she said, but she felt frustrated
because on "Brol,"
all the subjects that I tackled
were much more universal.
It spoke to anyone. This is more introspective.
That's true.
I've experienced other things since "Brol" came out.
Not necessarily music-related.
Well, I've grown up. I'm more of an adult.
I'm more…
I'm more ready to talk about serious matters.
I don't know. I'm getting worked up.
Plus, I think I'm going round in circles music-wise.
It's annoying me
because I feel like I can't do anything.
This video is useless. I'm sorry.
This is what happens when I make music. I never finish my sentences.
I'm talking to myself like an old hag. And…
I'm going back and forth to make tea.
I have doubts about everything I write or create.
I feel like a loser. That's what happens.
LONDON NOVEMBER 28 2020
Petit filou!
-Yeah! -How are you?
It's good to see you. How are you?
-Fine. -Hi, my dear.
How are you? I'm good.
Good.
I ended up being part of a pop star's project.
I was able to observe, like a fly on the wall,
how it worked from the inside.
On the one hand, I was impressed
to see this absolutely amazing woman.
She was talented and she was approachable. Much more than I thought.
It was reassuring because I realized you could be a big pop star
and be approachable.
No!
Maybe with time
It will go away
And yet somehow
I don't see it happening
Just like a medicine
I am nothing without you
I know that I try
And waste time in your arms
I've got a fever
So can you check?
Hand on my forehead
Kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby
I turn red
I've got a fever
So can you check?
I felt pressure
because it had been months since I had last performed.
Because this is next level.
I thought to myself, "What am I actually doing here?"
I asked myself that.
Honestly.
Really. The girl sings, dances…
I mean, she's a beast.
I just thought, "I'm not as good at all."
"I'm going to head home."
Where's Linkebeek?
So excited.
I'm not sure this is what I want for me.
Something that big.
But the energy, the ambition,
the craziness even…
Not being afraid…
It's inspired me.
For what comes next.
BRUSSELS, I LOVE YOU FINAL
One, two, three! Yes!
Brussels, I love you Brussels, I love you
I missed you Brussels, I love you
Brussels, I love you You're my favorite
Brussels, I love you Brussels, I love you
I missed you
You're the loveliest
Yes, you are
Paris is calling me
Well, Angèle?
-Hard at work. -How do you feel about the album?
I'm actually quite superstitious.
I didn't have any expectations with the first one.
I'm trying not to have any.
It's hard.
They keep on going
Even though she said It's not like it used to be
They keep on going
Music-wise,
I'm very happy with what we've done.
I'm more satisfied with the lyrics, but I know it won't be as popular.
It's more personal.
Maybe less unifying.
Though we didn't plan for the first one to be unifying.
It was just very naive.
The goal is to keep doing what I do. Yeah, keep living and…
Take my place, more than ever.
That's what I did with this album. I took my place.
The first album did happen this way,
but luck is everywhere.
I would need to be as lucky with the second album.
But I should also take that place and own up to it.
Now I'm here. I need to give it my all.
THE NEW ERA
IT'S OKAY TO REST
MAKE LOVE
LEARN HOW TO SAY NO
LISTEN TO MYSELF!
People often ask if I have dreams.
And actually,
as much as anyone else.
I think my dream now
is more of a personal quest.
Not so much the professional one.
It never has been.
I dream of being relaxed.
Of having the right people around.
Of growing up, learning from my mistakes.
Of being someone
who is good to people.
At the same time, who gets goodness back.
If my parents had had more normal jobs,
I think I would have a more normal job.
Maybe I would be very happy.
But actually,
I'm having an amazing time.
I love my life.
I just had to adapt to it
because it happened fast.
And
deep down, I wanted it to work out so bad.
I just didn't want to fail.
I wouldn't have said, "I want to nail it" to someone out loud.
I would write it down.
I couldn't say it because…
I'm sure it brought me luck not to say it. I'm superstitious.
I think I didn't say it
to avoid unpleasant surprises.
If it didn't work out, nobody knew I wanted it to.
Though it wasn't true.
Well, I wish her…
the best.
The best for her.
For everything to be okay.
Now, I can feel her becoming a woman.
She's starting to stand up or her beliefs, her desires.
She talks about it.
She used to be
way quieter.
I think.
I thought to myself,
"Would it be possible
for my granddaughter to become a star?"
I didn't dare say that to people.
I would say, "She makes music."
"Yes, but…"
They would say, "I saw Angèle on TV!"
"She's become someone."
-Did you know she's an actress now too? -No.
-You didn't know? -No.
She never tells me anything.
She's unbelievable.
Since she got that dog…
Okay, recording.
AUGUST 24, 2021
Pepete, did you pee?
You peed! Where did you pee?
It's just to say that the album is finished.
I think.
That scares me to death.
As usual.
I don't know how it'll be perceived.
How the audience will listen to it.
But that's not…
really up to me anymore.
This album is me at 25.
My quarter of a century.
It appeared to me that I wanted to keep it real.
Not try to be what I'm not.
I hope I'll never forget that.
I'll always be the girl from Linkebeek who writes simple songs.
Even if life changes,
that will stay with me.
Because all this…
is me.
Let's stop here.
Have a good journey.
THE END
Are you kidding me?
That's how you thank me.

At her peak, Cooper had a HUT rating of 54 -and a 27 audience share. -[imperceptible]
[narrator] She looks all right here, but inside, she's losing her mind
every time she utters the words, "Everything's fine,"
which happens to be the name of her morning show.

Good morning and welcome to Everything's Fine,
the morning show where everything's fine.
I'm your host, Sarah Cooper.
Today on the show, an exposé on age-defying makeup.
Does it have the power to take off
the 14 years you aged in the past six months?
We'll find out.
And coming up, there's a new robot CEO in town,
and this time, he's actually a robot.
My exclusive interview with Techtech Corp's new AI executive, 8008s.
Then, an exclusive look inside the now-famous Access Hollywood bus.
You don't want to miss it.
A little later, we'll check in on how the sky is doing
with our favorite meteorologist, Andrea Steele.
She's a scientist.
Plus, another zoo runs out of money
and we'll sugarcoat what happens to all the animals.
-Hope you don't like emus. -[chuckles]
Then, we'll have all the latest fall fashions
you can wear to that conference call from your bedroom.
Big story this morning.
Scientists say an asteroid is headed straight for this…
Breaking news!
Breaking news.
The president is on the line and wants to say hi.
I guess we weren't able to change our number.
How are you doing, Mr. President?
[Trump's voice] So, we have many exciting things that we'll be announcing over the next, uh…
that we'll be announcing over the next, uh…
-eight weeks, I would say. -Oh. Exciting.
We're gonna get things done.
We're gonna get things done that they've wanted to see done…
for a long, long time.
What have you started on, Mr. President?
We're gonna get things done.
We have, uh… We're taking on immigration, taking on education.
We're taking on so many aspects of things that, uh…
people were hopelessly tied up in knots in Congress,
but you'll see, uh…
levels of detail,
-levels of thought… -I would love to see detail.
…that a lot of people believed very strongly we didn't have in this country.
Uh, Mr. President, it looks like you're golfing.
Things that nobody has even contemplated, thought about, thought possible.
We're gonna get things done. [coughs]
So when are you gonna start on this stuff?
So, I think we'll start sometime on Tuesday?
[Sarah] Tuesday works.
Then we're going into the immigration, the world of immigration
-and education. -Immigration, education.
You did mention that before.
We're going into the world of healthcare.
-Oh! I'm gonna let you get back… -…a lot of exciting…
…to starting on those plans, Mr. President.
Thank you so much for calling us again.
A lot of us are working from home, but some of us are twerking from home.
Here to show us how she does it, please welcome Megan Thee Stallion.
Hi, Sarah Cooper!
-Good morning, Megan. -Sarah!
-[static] -Can you hear me?
-Megan? -[Megan] Sarah?
-Megan… Megan, can you hear me? -Sarah!
Megan?
Megan?
[chuckles] We're gonna get a little update from Scooter in a second.
We'll sort this right out.
We'll just move on.
Scooter, are you getting the Internet?
It seems to be working fine right here.
Plenty of Wi-Fi.
Plenty.
Oh, my goodness, the Internet, right?
-Wi-Fi is so weird. -Yeah.
-Do we need a modem, Scooter? -We need a modem, yeah… [chuckling]
[Sarah] It's a cable joke.
Yeah. We'll have to wait between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.
for them to come in. [laughing]
So funny.
We might not have any Internet access, but in good news,
we have a woman whose baked goods have become a national sensation.
Not just for how they taste, but for what they wear.
Please welcome, all the way from Wedgecot, New Jersey,
the creator of Cupcake Shoes, K.J. Dillard.
[Scooter] Think you're going the wrong way.
There we go.
[director] All right, go to camera two.
Beautiful.
[in sing-song voice] My pretty.
Little bit of curly hair for you.
[softly] There we go.
-Welcome, K.J.! -[gasps]
Oh, my God, you startled me. [chuckles]
I'm here to do the Sarah Cooper show.
And we are so excited to have you.
These might be the cutest cupcakes I've ever seen.
They are my pride and joy.
Now I'd appreciate it if you got Sarah for me. Thank you.
I'm Sarah Cooper.
I didn't say "Sierra," honey. I said "Sarah."
That is Sarah Cooper.
I'm Sarah Cooper, the host of the show.
You're Sarah Cooper?
-Yep. -Can I see some ID?
Here is my license, passport, and my birth certificate.
No, I need to see some kind of a permit that shows me
that you're allowed to be on the premises.
Okay, K.J.,
why don't you tell our viewers how you came up with this fabulous idea?
Well, I used to design these dolls called "little pooples"
that you'd put on the end of your toilet,
and then I got tired because I wasn't able to eat 'em.
So, should I be sharing personal information with this person?
It just… It helps with banter.
I love this little guy.
What is his name?
His name is Broadway Berry 'cause he's berry-flavored,
and he's very fragile.
Well, I am ready to make one.
-[dialing] -[operator] 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
-This is Karen June Dillard. -Karen!
I am with a person and my gut tells me she is up to no good.
-Scooter. -I can't hear anything. Got my gloves on.
[K.J.] Yes, she's a female.
And I would say at least 70% Africo-American.
Yes. Now she's destroying my property!
This is my property.
[woman] Welcome to "Karens."
I'm Whoopi Goldberg.
In 1876, a Boston Karen bemoaned to her husband
how taxing it was for her to walk miles into town
every time she wanted to get a Black person arrested.
He vowed to resolve this issue.
"Wife," he said, "I shall make it so that you may summon the police on Black people
from the comfort of our very home."
His name was Alexander Graham Bell.
[Karen Bell] They're standing by my horse!
[Whoopi] But the role of Karens did not start with the invention of the telephone.
The New World was crawling with Karens.
Karen over here, Karen over there, Karens every-goddamn-where.
[Karen] They're on my property!
[Whoopi] Some even claim that they can trace the roots of Karens
as far back as the book of Genesis.
[Karen] They're eating that snake's apple!
[Whoopi] When we come back, my actual next-door neighbor, Karen.
I've got a few choice words to say to this bitch.
[man] Sore muscles, back pain, headaches and weakness.
If you have COVID-19, getting a good night's sleep can be rough.
But starting now, your pesky pains are over.
From the makers of MrPillow comes a brand-new product,
the MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine.
Hi.
I'm Steve Windell, the creator of MrPillow and MrPillowPlus.
For 20 years, I've dedicated my life to making firm yet fluffy pillows
that don't break the bank.
So, I thought, "Why not take the magic of MrPillow
and use it to make a vaccine for coronavirus?"
So, how does it work? It's pretty simple, actually.
The MrPillow Vaccine is made from thousands of tiny microscopic pillows
shrunken down to the size of the deadly virus.
Once injected into the bloodstream, these individualized pillows
insert themselves under the novel coronavirus
and lull it into a restful slumber.
The virus now defenseless, the body's immune cells can go to work.
That's how we here at MrPillow put the science back in sleep science.
I got my friendly MrPillow Vaccine in the mail,
and three days later, I already feel immune to COVID
and ready to mix and mingle.
I'm even going to a pool party later.
Thank you, MrPillow.
And I had COVID for three weeks and then I got it again!
Hey! I think I'll load up on that vaccine right now.
Nurse?
I feel better already.
Order the MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine for just four easy payments of $99,
or $12,000 with insurance.
The MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine works.
[man] The MrPillow Coronavirus Vaccine may cause coronavirus.
[Trump's voice] Anynomous… really anomous.
Thank you so much to our viewers for your patience.
We got our technical difficulties all figured out
and we are so excited to welcome "she likes to hoist up her moist stuff,"
Megan Thee Stallion.
Hey, Sarah Cooper!
Megan, it is so amazing to have you here.
You are such a legend.
I have a question.
I'm sure it's on the minds of all our viewers.
How are you dealing with this whole "new normal" thing?
Listen, Sarah Cooper,
I'm not going outside until coronavirus is a memory, okay?
Like, you can go back in the textbook and be like,
"Damn, y'all remember coronavirus? That shit was crazy, right?"
-[chuckles] Yeah. -So until then, I'm staying my ass in the house.
[narrator] Sarah had to make a pee-pee,
but knew she had to play it cool for the folks at home.
I have to say, that ass you're staying in the house is very nice.
How do you look so good all the time?
Well, you know, I like to work out, gotta keep that ass tight, sharp.
[chuckling] Real hot-girl shit.
[Sarah] Yeah, real hot-girl stuff.
Any tips you can give us for working out at home?
Definitely. I actually have this great workout called "Drink your drink."
-Drink your drink? -Goes like this.
Get your cup, and one… and two. And…
Is that cognac?
Yes, Sarah Cooper, yeah, it is.
I been doing this every day for quarantine and let me tell you, I feel great.
Well, you look great.
Thanks. You, too, can look like this.
All you gotta do is grab some cognac, add a little squat to it.
Even a little lunge.
Real easy, like… Mmm.
Like that?
A little more sexy
and a little less like you sitting on the toilet.
Somebody get her some cognac.
-Scooter, can I get some cognac? -[Scooter] Yes.
Trying to do the six feet, so…
So, all you gotta do is dip and sip.
[both] Dip and sip.
Dip and sip.
-Yep, yep, yep. -[sexy music playing]
I think I'm doing it!
I've never twerked before in my life. [laughs]
-It's happening. -No, try it like this.
-Try it a little more sexy. -Okay.
-Pow, pow, pow. -Little hair flip.
Girl, live your life, do you, be a hot girl.
Everybody wasn't meant to be in the twerk Olympics,
so just do you, be you.
-Be the best Sarah Cooper you can be. -I can do that.
This is a really great workout.
I know! Real hot-girl shit.
[Scooter] If you don't mind, this is supposed to be six feet.
We certainly are lubed up here at the Everything's Fine studio.
We'll be right back.
[Scooter] All right, we are out. Good job.
-[cork pops] -This stuff is really strong.
It's the 3:00 a.m. hour here on QAnon QAC.
Just a note, this is the real QAnon,
not the other one people were saying was the real QAnon on 4chan.
Please stop doxing me.
I've had to move five times.
Let's check in with our viewers.
Emma from Philadelphia.
[Emma] Hey, Ashley.
How are you this morning?
Longtime caller, always listening.
You blinked your right eye just now when you said this was the real QAnon.
Was that a sign that you have been contacted by the god of fire?
[chuckles] Don't be ridiculous, Emma.
That was a nervous tic in my eye.
It was not a coded message.
Believe me, you will know when I've been contacted by the god of fire.
Thanks, Ashley.
-[easy jazz music playing] -This morning, we are proud to feature
our Indoctrination Porcelain Doll Collection.
They're stunning dolls, and yes, we do accept cryptocurrency,
but only QCoin.
Let's take a look at these dolls.
How adorable.
It's presidential mouthpiece, Kellyanne.
[Kellyanne's voice] Don't be so overly dramatic about it, Chuck.
What it… You're saying it's a falsehood,
and they're giving Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave…
alternative facts to that, but the point…
Ugh. Never a dull moment.
This one just talks and talks and talks and talks and talks.
Order soon as this one has recently been discontinued.
[gasps] Ah! My naan!
Thank you, Quincy.
I'm so sorry.
I am just so starving and it is hard to get good Indian food
in this undisclosed location.
Next caller.
[man] Hey, Ashley.
[laughing] Mike from Minnesota, how are you again?
Did you just get naan from Quincy?
Is that a code for QAnon?
Right? QAnon, a sign that you're Q?
I am not Q, I am just on in the middle of the night selling porcelain dolls.
Q is in Washington uncovering a cabal of sex predators.
I appreciate you sending me messages through the TV.
Next we have, "I am woman, hear me roar,
but very softly so I still sound sexy." [softly] Ivanka.
This doll teaches our daughters that it's better to be seen and not heard.
[Ivanka's voice] If being complicit is wanting to…
Is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact,
then I'm complicit.
The storm is coming.
I told you this was the real QAnon.
Next caller!
[distorted voice] How's it going?
Are you saying we can expect a storm
when the president will reveal the mass execution
of the Washington figures responsible for murdering a DNC staffer?
I'd say keep your eyes open,
and coming up in the 4:00 a.m. hour, we have a phenomenal weighted blanket
that you're not gonna--
Weighted blankets are a media tool invented by George Soros.
Watch your back, Ashley.
I always do, honey. I have to.
Finally, we have the best first lady, Melania.
Beautiful, stunning, and really, what else do you need?
[Melania's voice] I'm very involved in charities now, many charities
involving children, involving many different diseases.
Hi… Melania.
All of these dolls are available now by calling 666-666-6666…
This is not the real QAnon.
Get out now!
[Sarah] The former QAnon host starts her new job at the White House this week.
We have some breaking news coming in.
It appears the president is live-tweeting this program right now,
and we've noticed a ratings bump
when we show what he's saying about us in real time,
so… that's what we're gonna do.
Okay, so the president is saying that everything is not fine.
Uh, I guess we'll have to see if we can change the name of the show.
[Scooter] I'm open to it.
"Now they're playing my tweet. Stop playing my tweet. That's my tweet."
The president now thinks "the country is totally fine"
and "it's the best it's ever been."
"Because of me."
Who, me? "No, me, the president."
"Best president ever."
[cheerfully] Best president ever!
And the president now likes our show again and our ratings are…
up! Great.
More on these tweets as they continue to suck the life out of our democracy.
-[buzzer sounds] -[theme song playing]
-[Scooter] Great segment. -[Sarah] Thank you!
[narrator] Sarah wasn't sure the segment had gone great.
She wasn't sure of much at all anymore.
[Scooter] Uh, we're ready for robot CEO.
I'm Sarah Cooper.
[echoes] I'm Sarah Cooper.
We'll be right back.
[director] We're out.
Do you know what I miss?
Shawarma.
I miss eating shawarma in a really crowded restaurant
in close proximity to other diners.
Yeah. People sitting two feet away from you
just shoveling food into their disgusting mouths.
[man] I miss that human connection.
-[director] Oh, Sarah. -Hi.
-Why did you want to meet with us? -You called me in here.
[man] Okay, smarty pants.
Let's look at your file and see how your ratings are doing.
I forgot. I can't read.
All right. [clears throat]
Looks like 35% of our audience likes that you're Black,
30% of our audience doesn't like that you're Black,
50% of our audience doesn't know you're Black,
but thankfully, 80% of our audience feels extremely threatened by you, Sarah.
It's that attitude of yours.
-I don't think I have an attitude. -[man] There it is.
There it is.
The boss didn't hire you to be aggressive.
The boss hired you to be a non-threatening Black woman like Tootie and Lisa Turtle,
and that other one.
Lovable, but forgettable.
Well, I think it might be a little confusing,
because I'm named Sarah, and I feel like when my parents named me Sarah,
a white lady just moved into my body and gentrified my whole personality,
you know?
Like, my mom would cook jerk chicken--
-I love jerk chicken. -He does. He's a jerk.
-He loves the chicken. -I love it.
And I'd be like, "Oh, this is too spicy." And she'd say,
And I'd be like, "Oh, this is too spicy." And she'd say, [in Jamaican accent] "There are children around the world,
all they get for dinner is bread and water."
And I'd be like, "That actually sounds pretty good."
Like, a scone and a chai latte.
Yes, a scone and chai tea latte would be perfect.
Any time of the day.
Um… That would be really great 'cause I was born in Jamaica,
-but moved here when I was three. -Jamaica.
I knew it.
I actually watched these characters when I was little.
I mean, Tootie and Lisa and Hilary and… and…
And that other one.
I mean, these characters inspired me, you know?
I feel like they ran so that I could sing.
But you can't sing, which is why you're on the morning show and not on Broadway.
Okay, I will tone it down.
[director] Yeah. Stick to the news. All right? Leave politics out of it.
Got it.
Thank you.
[man] Better go.
-Yeah. -Marv, do you think
I should buy another gun?
Lorraine, what are you talking about?
Are you crazy?
-Of course you should buy another gun. -Thank you.
-We live in very dangerous times. -You're right.
[Scooter] Hey, pals. How's it going?
-Hi! Scooter. -Hey, Scooter.
What's going on here?
[Scooter] This is to keep things safe, six-foot distance.
-Smart. -He's so smart.
[Scooter] Well, as you were.
-See you later. -[Lorraine] Thank you.
Get the door on your way out?
[Scooter] Sure. I can't touch the doorknob.
Can you just shut the door, please?
[Scooter] It's not me, it's the door.
[Lorraine] Gotta get some work done.
-If you could-- -Close the door!
[Scooter] This has to get fixed.
This is Connie Chung with the president this morning.
Mr. President, what is your plan to unite the country?
[Trump's voice] I'm not a big fan of sharks either.
I don't know how many votes I'm gonna lose.
I have people calling me up, "Sir, we have a fund to save the shark,
it's called 'Save the Shark.'" I say, "No, thank you."
Oh, no. Mr. President, I was asking you about uniting the country.
I think I am actually humble.
I'm much more humble than you would understand.
-Mr. President, I asked you about-- -Excuse me. Stop and frisk.
Okay? Stop and frisk.
-All right… -Excuse me.
You take guns away.
Rudy Giuliani was a great mayor. He did it in New York.
He started it and it worked great.
-I'm sorry? -Excuse me.
You have people coming over with bags of soup, big bags of soup,
and they lay it on the ground and the anarchists take it
and they start throwing it at our cops. Bags of soup, big bags of soup.
If it hits you, it's worse than a brick 'cause it's got force.
So, that was my interview with the president.
Hi, I'm Steve Windell,
and you're gonna love my new line of MrPillow feminine hygiene products.
Because your vagina deserves a tampon
as soft and absorbant as one of my pillows.
Try our down-feather version, too!
[woman] In these uncertain times,
we turn to familiar faces.
And since 1975, we've been there for you…
Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.
We had to go away for a while, but we knew it wouldn't be long.
Orgies. We're back!
-[crowd cheering] -Now with curbside pickup.
-[lullaby playing] -[Trump's voice] Thighland! Thighland!
The super-duper missile.
-Did you make this coffee, Scooter? -I did not.
[Sarah] Welcome back to Everything's Fine. Big story this morning.
As we've previously reported,
a huge shake-up in the CEO world happened last Friday
when we learned the CEO of Techtech Corp is actually a robot.
Strangely, no one even noticed for several months.
Live in studio via Camrojex technology,
please welcome 8008s.
Thanks, Sarah. It's great to be here.
[Sarah] Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule.
Well, I can multitask better than my human counterparts, Sarah.
For example, right now, I'm chatting with you, doing Joe Rogan's podcast,
and kicking off a workplace diversity program all at the same time.
Okay, so is it safe to assume you're programmed
to simply do everything your predecessors did?
Unlike Elon Musk, I have a human side.
[Scooter chuckles] Elon Musk.
I was made by a great group of guys who really take social change seriously.
For example, I'm programmed with the complete knowledge of feminist content
such as Sex and the City,
Cosmo and "Hot Girl Summer."
I'm not sure I'd consider that feminist--
I've also learned about the Black experience in America
by watching all three Barbershop movies, and the Beauty Shop spin-off.
Okay, again, I'm not sure we--
I'm sorry. I'm being told that I'm getting off track.
As president and CEO, my number-one job is to make my shareholders happy.
But that's kind of been the problem, hasn't it?
Big businesses just focusing on money, making myopic business moves
that leave the whole country with more disparity and…
How are you doing that?
Camrojex technology.
Just relax.
This is really inappropriate. But technically, you're a robot
and I haven't had a massage in months.
That feels incredible.
Hold on, we have some breaking news.
It's been reported that Robot CEO 8008s has been fired by its board of directors
after making unwanted advances toward an office printer.
That printer knew exactly what it was doing.
It was always asking me to make a copy.
Because that's its job.
And it's not just a printer, it has a name.
HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s,
whose side of the story I'm sure we all want to hear.
Scooter, can we get HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s
on the cloud system?
Thank you so much for joining us, HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s.
Tell us what happened.
Okay, wait, wait. I'll, uh… I'll make a public statement.
Okay? Just give me two seconds to think.
After eight months of careful soul-searching,
I've decided to address the hideous allegations against me.
I have not, nor have I ever mistreated or abused a printer/scanner/copier.
I value printers.
My printer… is a printer.
HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s, is there anything you want to say?
Sounds like we're getting a fax.
"Fuck you, 8008s."
I will now step away to spend time with my family.
AI has come so far.
[Scooter] Three, two, one. We're out.
Can't believe he's a robot.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give a big Allstate Arena parking lot welcome to Sarah Evak.
Thank you all so much.
Hi, my name is Sarah Evak and I'm a close-up card magician.
Uh, I've been doing this for, I don't know, ten years.
I've been everywhere. Singapore, you name it.
Tonight's show is at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont.
Pretty exciting for me.
I'm going to begin by introducing you to my family.
I call them my family because some I see often
and others when I least expect them.
Can everyone see these?
I'm going to shuffle these cards and you tell me when to stop.
[Sarah] Okay, I haven't started shuffling yet.
Now I'm shuffling.
Got it.
Now I'm going to show you all this card.
Can everyone see this card?
Does anyone work here?
-Can you take this card and show it? -Yeah.
-Don't show it to me. -Oh, okay.
During COVID, I'm also a teacher in a Zoom Room.
But this…
This is where I come alive.
Beep when you've seen it.
-[horn beeps] -[man] I've never worked with a magician.
I was a Frankenstein at a haunted house once, though.
So, you know, I'm used to being around performers.
Is this your card?
I had to get out of that racket 'cause of the Illuminati.
You know, they want to get you.
It's like, not for me. Nope, I'll stick to parking lot attendant.
That's the life for me. Simple.
I think it went okay.
Yeah. I might have to buy giant cards for shows like these in the future.
I don't know. There's a lot of beeping.
So, when is this gonna be on? I just wanna make sure that I catch it.
-[man] Uh, sometime next year. -Okay.
Do you want to see another trick? No? Okay.
[woman] We followed the guidelines. We reopened when it was safe.
But now, it's not safe again.
-[crowd] Aw! -[man 1] Honestly?
-[woman] Orgies. Maybe later. -[man 2] Damn it.
-Wonderful place. -Wonderful.
-Oh, my goodness. -Unbelievable.
Oh, hello.
My name is Natalie, and this is my husband, John.
-Hi, there. -[chuckles]
Welcome to Mar-a-Lago. We love it here.
-It is beautiful. You hear me? -Oh, it's gorgeous.
I know what you're thinking. "Do they allow Black people at Mar-a-Lago?"
-Um, we're here! -Right? Laugh it off.
-We are Black-ish, though. -Last time we checked.
-Last time we checked, we were. -Yes.
And we've actually met the president.
-He saw us… -Yes, we did.
…and he said that we are his two favorite Black people.
-And he says it every single time. -Every time. Mmm-hmm.
Such a charismatic personality he has. He's such a celebrity.
We actually got married here.
Um, not in the big ballroom, but on the property.
So it was still beautiful.
-Yes. -Yeah.
We're not allowed in there right now.
We're not allowed in there yet,
but there is a small room off to the side
with a private entrance, very exclusive.
[laughs] And they said we can go in there whenever we want.
-We can stay in there if we want to. -Anytime.
And then, one night, we actually got locked in there.
And let's just say it was very fortuitous.
-Yes, it got kind of hot in there. -[ominous music playing]
We just love it here.
Just surrounded by all our friends.
Surrounded by all of our friends, which is the most important part.
We got you in our hearts.
Right on.
[Sarah] If you like skateboarding dogs,
you're gonna wanna stick around after Everything's Fine
for Thinking Outside the Bachs with Jordana Bachman.
[Jordana] I don't know what this is about to be, but okay!
[Sarah] Coming up at the twelve o'clock hour.
Let's do the weather segment.
-Love the weather. Love the weather! -[Lorraine] Mmm.
Okay, weather segment in three, two…
And now, let's check in on how the sky's doing today
with our meteorologist, Andrea Steele.
Thanks, Sarah. Well, we're looking at some real clear skies today,
up to 75 degrees. Absolutely beautiful out.
Let's look ahead at the five-day forecast.
Tuesday, we're gonna see a bit of rain, but break out that summer gear
as temperatures shoot up to a whopping 103 degrees.
Wednesday, out of nowhere, there's gonna be a ferocious hailstorm
with sustained winds up to 75-plus miles per hour.
Scooter, you may wanna board up your windows.
My windows are always boarded up.
You know that weird house in your neighborhood
that's got all the boards up in the windows,
and everyone thinks, "Is that an abandoned hospital?"
That's my place.
Excellent. Thursday, you might wanna break out the sunscreen again,
because it's gonna be a hot one.
123 degrees with a humidity index so high,
a friend of mine who works at the EPA called me crying. He's a grown man.
Friday, we shoot down to negative 12 degrees
with a windchill index we weren't even able to calculate
using a Doppler 8000 technology.
It's gonna be a cold one, folks.
Most likely not survivable, so wear a jacket.
And Saturday, temperatures radically return to breezy 75 degrees.
However, that isn't just a cute graphic we made up.
We're actually projecting literal flaming snowmen
to be walking the streets with some possible fire tornado watches in effect.
Everything's fine with the weather. I'm Andrea Steele. Back to you, Sarah.
Andrea, I'm sorry, but that forecast is--
Insane? Uh, yeah. You think?
I mean, I've been doing the weather for 17 years, Sarah,
and I have never seen anything like this in my entire lifetime.
You think I like telling people they're gonna die,
or their skin might peel off if they run to the grocery store?
No one should be going outside unless they absolutely have to.
-[heart beating] -Scooter?
-[narrator] Everything was not fine. -[exhales deeply]
Scooter, are you asleep?
[narrator] Had the world gone mad?
Andrea, are you okay?
Am I okay? This bitch.
Am I okay?
No,
actually, 'cause we got a bat disease just floating around in the sky,
there's a new natural disaster every motherfucking day,
factories destroying the environment. Look at this damn forecast behind me.
This is the first time I've left my house in months!
All it takes is one wrong motherfucker to breathe on me funny,
and I swear to God…
Scooter, are we still on a nine-second delay?
The woman who presses that button stopped coming in weeks ago.
Well, in that case, let me just say this.
Fuck, shitty, doo-doo, bitch, and stay the fuck in your house.
Reporting live from hell on earth, this is Andrea motherfucking Steele.
Back to you, Sarah.
That was great. We'll be right back.
Great. We're out. Nice.
So that's your house I walk by every day.
[Scooter] Yeah.
Ah. My kids are terrified to go past there.
[chuckling] That's the one.
It doesn't look like anyone's lived there in hundreds of years.
-[Scooter] That's my place. -[Andrea] Interesting.
-Well, it's safe. -It's spooky.
-[Scooter] Yeah. -It's awful there.
Everybody ready? Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one.
Welcome back to Everything's Fine. I'm Sarah Cooper.
And now for our top story,
an exclusive look inside that now-famous Access Hollywood bus.
[man's voice] She used to be great. Still beautiful.
[Trump's voice] I moved on her. She was down in Palm Beach.
I moved on her and I failed, I'll admit it.
-Whoa. -I did try and fuck her. She was married.
-That's huge news there. -[Trump's voice] No, Nancy…
This was… And I moved on her very heavily.
In fact, I took her out furniture shopping.
She wanted to get some furniture.
I said, "I'll show you where they have some nice furniture."
Took her out furniture-- I moved on her like a bitch.
But I couldn't get there, and she was married.
All of a sudden I see her, she's now got the big phony tits
and everything. She's changed her look.
Sheesh, your girl's hot as shit.
In the purple.
-[all] Whoa! -[Billy Bush's voice] Yes!
Yes! The Donald has scored!
Oh, my man!
Wait, you gotta look at me when you…
-Thumbs up. -[Trump's voice] You're a pussy.
You gotta put the thumbs up. Gotta get the thumbs up.
You can't be too happy.
-[man 1] Let me… -[man 2] That's funny.
You and I will walk out.
Oh, my God.
Maybe it's a different one.
Better not be the publicist. No, it's her.
[Trump's voice] Yeah, that's her. With the gold.
I gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her.
I'm automatically attracted to beautiful… I just start kissing them.
-It's like a magnet, I just kiss. -[laughing]
I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it.
Just kiss. Just…
-You can do anything. -Whatever you want.
Grab 'em by the pussy.
I can do anything. I can do anything.
Those legs, all I can see is the legs.
Oh, it looks good.
-Come on, shorty. -Ooh, nice legs, huh?
Oof. Get out of the way, honey. That's good legs.
Go ahead.
It's always good if you don't fall out of the bus.
Like Ford, Gerald Ford, remember?
[Bush's voice] Down below. Pull the handle.
Hello. How are you? Hi.
-[Zucker's voice] How are you? -[Trump's voice] Terrific.
-Pleasure to meet you. -You know Billy Bush?
Hello, nice to see you. How you doing, Arianne?
I'm doing well, thank you. Ready to be a soap star?
We're ready. Make me a soap star.
How about a hug for the Donald? He just got off the bus.
-Want a little hug? -[Trump's voice] Absolutely.
Melania said this was okay.
Hug for the Bushy? I just got off the bus.
-Oh! Bushy. -[Bush's voice] Here we go.
Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.
You've got a nice costar here.
-Yes. Absolutely. -[Trump's voice] After you.
Great. We're out. Nice.
Scooter, what is happening?
[Lorraine] This job is made for you, Marvin.
Yeah, it keeps me out of trouble, as they say.
Everything's fine.
Three, two, one, and we're in. Sarah.
And now, a little preview of what's coming on after Everything's Fine.
We'll have Jordana Bachman of Thinking Outside the Bachs,
followed by Sandy Manderson, Miyoko Loco,
and then, Andre Cole Watkins of Watkins the News.
Stick around, it's gonna be a great day. Isn't it, Scooter?
Miyoko Loco.
[chuckles] A little help here.
Save me.
How about Sandy Manderson?
Her face froze?
Help.
Tomorrow, something bad happens to your favorite celebrity.
We'll have a full report.
Now, it's over to Jordana Bachman for Thinking Outside the Bachs.
Jordana, how are you doing?
I'm doing good, girl. How are you, sister-friend?
I'm doing so good. What do you got going on on the show today?
Oh, well, let me tell you. A little bit of this, a little bit of that. Who knows?
It's the news. Who cares?
You know, Jordana, I just realized we don't have to do this anymore.
You have to tell me. Do what? Do what? [laughing]
This whole BFF handoff like we're friends,
laughing like we care about each other.
We don't care about each other.
[Jordana] That, girl, is good news,
because everyone can see through the bullshit!
I don't even know where you live.
I don't even see you except in this TV screen.
That's how I feel, just seeing you through a little box.
What have you been up to?
Girl, I've been up to so much.
I've locked up every Black man in my life.
I put my dad in a closet, my brother in a closet,
my uncle in a closet, to make sure they live another day.
Wow. Where do you put your clothes?
Oh, my God. What are we doing?
Scooter.
I'm sorry?
And now, it is over to you, Jordana Bachman.
Oh, no, girl, I couldn't. I couldn't.
I have to pass it back to you, Sarah Cooper.
You're so funny. Back to you.
You're up next with Thinking Outside the Bachs.
No, Sarah, you got this one. Take my three-hour show.
No, I couldn't. I couldn't do that. Back to you, Jordana. Back to you.
Scooter?
-Oof. -[Sarah] Where'd she go?
Can we get Jordana back, please?
Jordana!
Back to you!
Back to you, Jordana.
All right.
Five, four, three, two…
Good morning. I'm Sarah Cooper, filling in for another three hours.
Jordana Bachman of Thinking Outside the Bachs
is taking a personal day.
Good morning. I'm Sarah Cooper. That's a lot of news.
And it's Sarah filling in for Andre Cole Watkins.
Five, four, three, two…
Good morning. I'm Sarah Cooper, covering for Andre Cole Watkins,
host of Watkins The News.
Is that a lot of news or what?
Three, two… [mouths]
Good morning. I'm Sarah Cooper filling in for Miyoko Loco of Miyoko You Loco.
Okay, Sarah. Three, two, one…
Follow me. [laughing]
Ooh, weather.
Good morning.
I'm Sarah Cooper.
I'm Sarah Cooper.
And everything's fine.
I'm Sarah Cooper.
I'm Sarah Cooper and everything's fine.
Everything's great.
It's gonna be a great day.
I'm Sarah Cooper.
I'm Sarah Cooper.
Good morning. I'm Sarah Cooper.
I'm Sarah Cooper and everything's fine.
That's a lot of news.
[Trump's voice] A lot of people are saying… It's called fake news.
Nobody's ever seen anything like it.
A lot of people are saying… It's called fake news.
Nobody's ever seen anything like it.
A lot of people are saying… It's called fake news.
Nobody's ever seen anything like it.
A lot of people are saying…
It's called fake news.
Nobody's ever seen anything like it.
[Scooter] Great job, Sarah Cooper.
Where'd she go?
Why is that chair spinning?
Is that a ghost?
Yes?
Oh, no. Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.
[Scooter] Sarah's doing great.
-Good morning. -[Scooter] She's doing very well.
Great morning. Great…
-Hi! -[shrieks]
Oh, my God! Who are you? What are you doing down here?
I'm Lacy Groin, from Against the Groin?
My show.
It's on every night at 9:00.
Oh, my God.
Lacy Groin!
-Yeah. -I love your show.
Oh, thank you.
It's been off the air for, like, four years.
-Four years? -[heart beating]
The last thing I remember was election night,
and I started hyperventilating.
I choked on my Invisalign,
and then I guess I passed out under here.
It's kinda weird nobody noticed.
Yeah. I found this work environment to be pretty toxic.
What did I miss?
I want to know everything.
Would you mind massaging my legs?
I think they're in atrophy.
-Cute shoes. -Thanks.
-That's a cute blazer. -Thank you.
So, tell me everything. What did I miss?
You want to know everything?
Oh, yeah. Everything.
Here's everything.
-No. -No, stop! No!
-Oh, God! -What?
That's against the law.
-No, no! -Yes, there's more!
No, I can't.
-Oh, God! -Look at me!
-There's more! -No! -There's more! -No!
I…
-I can't. -Here.
-Oh, MrPillow. -Hi.
Thank you. Gracias.
-Mmm. -See you later, Lacy.
Scooter?
Hello?
[Lorraine] Marvin, you're crazy.
[Marvin] Yes, I am.
[Lorraine] But what if we slot the Iranian assassination in 2024?
[Marvin] No, no, no.
I would do it sooner
because we want relations with Iran to go as poorly as possible.
Put it in 2021.
-[Lorraine] Okay. -Yes.
What if we shave two tons off the Greenland ice sheet?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2028 or 2022?
2027.
And let's do something with bugs.
I don't know. Hornets!
Who love to murder.
[both] Murder hornets!
-Oh! -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And China seizes Hong Kong, 2028.
And that pairs very nicely
with the US gassing its own citizens.
-[giggles] -Floods, 2026.
What if Tom Hanks gets sick?
Do it! He's due!
Kill off Mr. Peanut?
Cancel Coachella.
I hate those bands.
Eating bats?
I… No, that's too much.
Let's set Australia on fire! Turn the sky red!
[distorted voice] Do it all in 2020.
Really, boss?
That's a lot for one year, Dark Lord.
I said, do it all in 2020!
Okay, boss!
Uh, Satan.
Sarah, I understand.
You're mad as hell, and you're not gonna take this anymore. Hmm?
-Scooter? -Hey, boss.
Hey, Scooter.
I… I get it now.
I didn't see that before.
How'd you get in here?
You should really get back to the desk.
Back to the desk, Sarah Cooper.
I think I should go home.
[Whoopi's voice] What you gonna do, Satan? You know, we've tangled before.
And you know what happened.
It's Whoopi Goldberg talking to you now. What you gonna do?
[in normal voice] Oh, my God. I don't know where that came from.
[narrator] At this moment,
Sarah Cooper realized it wasn't she who had lost her mind,
it was the world.
Scooter, help me out.
You should just take the afternoon off.
I just went scuba diving.
I love scuba diving. You scuba dive?
-Love it. -Maybe we should give her a raise.
A raise would be great.
I'm not gonna get a raise.
I am a woman, so that does make more sense.
Take all the time you need, Sarah.
[in distorted voice] Never running out of news down here.
Great. Okay.
Well, I will just see you a little later.

[woman] I live in a very small cave and I love it.
I can have orgies every night.
You name it. Orgies, Doritos.
Maybe sometimes a Fanta.
It's so nice.
I'm not lying.
Sometimes I lie a little bit, okay.
-Really horrible. -Tomorrow is also a cold and cloudy day.
It will get no warmer than zero to four degrees Celsius.
There's a slight breeze from the south-west.
Yes, dear listener. It looks like we'll be having a white Christmas this year.
Tomorrow it is expected to snow even more.
-Even more snow. -You'll need to turn there.
-Where? -There.
-Where? -There. -Are you sure? -Yes.
-Are you sure? -Yes. -Really? -Yes, Mom.
-Really? -Yes, Mom.
So many people.
-Are we there yet? -I have no idea, dear.
Almost.
-Mom, you helped us move. -It wasn't dark then.
-Careful, you'll run them over. -Yes…
These streets are too tight.
What's your favorite Christmas memory? Give us a call at 0800…
Hey, watch it.
-Turn right here. -Yes, I know.
-Jules, will you help with the boxes? -Okay.
I don't agree with this. Why are you doing this, Suus?
Mommy, look.
Isn't it nice, hun?
Why can't you stay in Holland? Why are you moving to Belgium?
-This'll never work. -We already discussed this.
-Mommy, I'm hungry. -I'll get you something in a sec.
At least leave the kids with me during the holidays,
At least leave the kids with me during the holidays, so we can spend Christmas Eve.
-We can do that here. -You're only thinking of yourself.
What do you want? That I'm going to hide and cry back home?
I'm going to start over here. We'll get through this.
Okay… You shouldn't worry about us.
Will you say goodbye to Granny?
-Bye, Granny. -Bye, sweethearts. See you soon.
Bye, Jules. Bye.
You'll change your mind.
Our new home.
A new start, for all of us.
Where are the Christmas decorations?
We don't have any, yet.
Tomorrow I'll buy a tree. Promise.
We'll make it nice and cozy and celebrate Christmas like before.
We'll make it nice and cozy and celebrate Christmas like before. Don't you get it? It will never be like before.
Don't you get it? It will never be like before. We'll never be able to have Christmas.
I hate Christmas.
Hello. We came to welcome you. Is your mom home? Or your dad?
Hi. I'm sorry, my son…
We will have Christmas, right, Mommy?
Of course, sweetie. Jules just needs a bit of time.
-I'm Suzanne and this is Noor. -Hi, Noor. I'm Ella.
-I'm Suzanne and this is Noor. -Hi, Noor. I'm Ella. I'm Stef. We brought you a little gift.
I'm Stef. We brought you a little gift.
Welcome to our street.
-A Christmas gift, 'cause it's Christmas. -How nice. Thanks.
Yes.
-Honey. -Beautiful. Look, sweetheart.
See that light, Jules?
That's the light of the sun that will always return.
That's why we have Christmas.
To celebrate the light that always comes back, no matter how dark it gets.
-Okay, guys. We need to go. -I'll stay here.
I'm sorry, but you can't. You're too young to stay home alone.
Besides, there's no food in the house.
Okay, cornflakes. But you won't grow on that alone.
And Grandpa is really looking forward to seeing you.
Grandpa.
Come on, Jules. I don't want to be late on my first day.
Beautiful.
-Hi, neighbor. -Hello.
Neighbor, did you see this? Look.
We don't have decorations, yet. Mommy is going to buy a tree later.
Really? That's mega cool, for sure.
Really? That's mega cool, for sure. Hey, look. We've got loads of decorations left.
Hey, look. We've got loads of decorations left.
Or maybe we could make some together?
-Would you like that? -Yes.
-Good morning. -Hello.
-Come. We're going to see Grandpa. -Bye, Ella.
-Come. We're going to see Grandpa. -Bye, Ella. -Bye-bye. -I know the way.
-Bye-bye. -I know the way.
-Grandpa. -Oh, my little angel.
-Grandpa, I'm not an angel. -We're here.
Good morning.
-Grandpa? -Yes?
Why haven't you decorated it yet?
-I waited for you, of course. -Yes.
-Hey, Jules. -Hey.
It'll be alright.
My shift ends at six. I'll come straight here. If there's a problem…
My shift ends at six. I'll come straight here. If there's a problem… Relax. The longer they stay, the better.
Relax. The longer they stay, the better.
And you'll do great at your new job. You're the best cookie baker I know.
How many cookie bakers do you know?
-Mom is going to buy a tree later. -No?
-Yes. -Behave, okay? Bye, Jules.
-See you tonight. -Bye, Mom.
-Come on in. Look around. -Thank you.
Oh, that's cute.
-Why is this bear's paw bandaged? -It's broken.
But all that's broken can be fixed.
-Or a puzzle. That's cute. -That one. It's vintage.
It's a nice picture.
-Does it have all the pieces? -Almost.
-Does it have all the pieces? -Almost. One piece is missing, but that's the fun of it.
One piece is missing, but that's the fun of it.
-You won't know which piece, till the end. -Yes, that's true.
-No, honey. We're not buying it. -No.
Awesome. That's so yesterday. But so yesterday that it's cool again.
-Yes. -Beautiful, right?
How much is this?
That's not for sale. Sorry.
-Everything is for sale. -A lot, but not everything.
-Then we're going someplace else. -I think so too.
Thank you. Bye-bye.
-I want hot chocolate. -Me too. What about Jules?
-I want hot chocolate. -Me too. What about Jules? -Don't care. -So, three hot chocolates. Three.
-Don't care. -So, three hot chocolates. Three.
I'll do it.
Sure? Alright. Then I'll help Noor decorate the tree.
-I can do it. -Careful.
-Here. -Well done.
For Santa?
Grandpa?
Hello, Mr. Claus? Is that you?
Oh, Mr. Claus, are you back? Hello? Hello, who's there?
-Yes, hello? Who's there? Speak. -Make yourself known. Who are you?
-A robber. -Mr. Claus, is that you?
-A robber? -Alarm. -Alarm, alarm, okay. -A robber.
-Alarm, alarm, okay. -A robber.
Hey, Jules. Are the hot chocolates ready?
Is everything alright?
Where have you b…
-Are you Santa? -I don't know…
-Are you Santa? -I don't know… Grandpa, are you Santa?
Grandpa, are you Santa?
-This is not the time, Jules. -Are you Santa?
I hate Christmas.
Jules, that's impossible.
-Grandpa, we forgot this. -Sure, come on.
Do you want to do it?
Let me do it.
Grandpa. Grandpa. Grandpa.
We're always right on time. Our uniforms are clean.
-No jewels, that goes without saying. -Of course.
Brenda, what did we say about cellphones?
We can't use our telephones at work, right?
Just because I ask a question, doesn't mean I want an answer.
We work in seven and a half hour shifts.
We have a 45 minute lunch break. That's much too thick.
We bring our own lunches. After all, we couldn't touch the cookies, right?
Sometimes we could, right? You need to…
What's this?
That's right, a failed cookie. And what do we do with those?
That's right.
What do we do if we need to take a toilet break during working hours?
Oh, then I'll…
We'll ask permission from our supervisor.
We never leave our station without sanitary approval.
Have we got all that?
I'm asking if everything's clear.
Oh, an actual question. Yes, it's very clear.
This is your station.
I was told I would get the opportunity to design my own cookie.
These are the Christmas cookies I make with my kids.
Everyone likes them very much.
Here we bake cookies, not coloring books.
Would you like one? The only cookies we make here, are our cookies. Understood?
The only cookies we make here, are our cookies. Understood?
Is she always like that?
-I'm Suzanne. -I'm Jet. Nice to meet you.
You're supposed to help me package the cookies.
Who would want these boring cookies?
They're Miss Jantien's creations.
Boring, colorless cookies, made by a failure.
Would you like to try one?
I'm sure they're delicious, but I'd rather try one during lunch.
I'm sure they're delicious, but I'd rather try one during lunch. Come on. Made them myself.
Come on. Made them myself.
Oh, those are good.
What's the meaning of this?
Fahrid, button your coat.
My apologies. Yes?
-Suzanne? -Yes?
It's for you.
-Are you Suzanne? -Yes.
-Hi, I'm Fahrid. -Hi.
Oh, sure.
Hello?
Yes, I'll be right there.
What's wrong?
My father-in-law is in hospital. He fell. I need to get to my bike.
I'll take you. I have a car.
-What about work? -Family is more important.
Suzanne? Fahrid? No one leaves their station without permission.
There they are.
-Mommy. -Hey, sweetheart.
-Are you alright? -Grandpa fell.
No… Where is he now? There.
Hi, I'm Fahrid. I work with your mom.
-Maybe I should wait in the car. -Yes, fine. Thank you.
-You're the mom? -Yes. How is he?
-You're the mom? -Yes. How is he? He's lucky.
His shoulder will heal, but him falling was a warning.
He should take it easy.
Not too much stress, otherwise he won't be so lucky next time.
-May we see him? -Of course.
-We'll need to keep him overnight. -Okay. Come on. Come.
Relax, it'll all be alright.
-No, it won't. -Jules?
Mommy?
Daddy had an accident. It'll all be alright.
I promise.
Jules?
Grandpa is asking for you.
You're so much alike. You're both just as stubborn.
I understand it's hard.
Just do it for Grandpa.
Please.
Mommy.
-Hi, Mom. -Hi, Suus.
Listen, I was at the grocery store and they had those fluorescent vests
Listen, I was at the grocery store and they had those fluorescent vests with those lights on them…
with those lights on them…
Mom, Grandpa Belgium is in hospital.
-What happened? -Nothing to worry about.
Then why is he in hospital? Not because it's fun.
Excuse me, ma'am?
Wait, Mom. Will you say hi to Granny?
-Hi, Granny. -Hi, Noor. Are you in the hospital too?
-Yes, we went by ambulance. -That's scary. Are you guys okay?
-Mommy cried. I did too. -Oh, my sweet girl.
-Santa hasn't come yet. -I'm sure he'll come.
-Wait till you see what's under the tree. -We don't have a tree.
Grandpa, what are you doing?
I don't want all that stuff. There's nothing wrong with my heart.
-I just got a bit dizzy. -Please, don't.
I need to get back to work, you know that. Where's the snow globe?
I need to get back to work, you know that. Where's the snow globe? -You mustn't strain yourself. The doctor… -They don't know anything. Come on.
-You mustn't strain yourself. The doctor… -They don't know anything. Come on.
The kids should stay outside. Follow me.
Jules, Jules.
Mr. Claus, you need to leave those sensors on.
Go and get the snow globe. Go and get it, Jules.
Jules. There's a sandwich for you too.
Jules. There's a sandwich for you too. -Thanks, but I already ate. -I don't like carrot, Mom.
-Thanks, but I already ate. -I don't like carrot, Mom.
Every healthy sandwich has carrot on it.
-I'm sorry. -No worries.
-Hi, Mom. -Hi, Suus. Back home?
-We just got home. -What was it then?
Nothing serious. He's a bit overworked.
-Overworked? -Mom…
-How are the kids? -Fine. Ella from next door is here.
She's going to watch the kids while I'm at work.
-From next door? How old is she? -Your age?
-From next door? How old is she? -Your age? -Fifteen. -Twenty-two.
-Fifteen. -Twenty-two.
Mom, I'll call you tonight. I have to go.
-Will you manage? -Of course.
-Do you want to make decorations? -Yes.
Okay, we'll do that.
-If there's a problem, call me. Bye, Noor. -Bye, Mom.
-Make sure Jules eats his sandwich. -Okay.
-Bye. -Ciao.
Bye, Jules.
Come on, Jules. What would Dad do?
Here you go, a healthy sandwich. With…
no carrot.
-Do you have scissors and glue? -Yes, but I don't know where.
Don't worry about your grandpa. He just needs to rest.
But he won't rest. He really won't.
Then someone needs to babysit him too.
Grandpa?
Grandpa? What are you doing?
-I'm escaping. -I escaped too.
And? Did you get the snow globe?
-That's for tomorrow. -Tomorrow?
-First you need to rest. -I can't, Jules.
I need to go. The kids are waiting for their presents.
I'll go and help you.
-I thought you hated Christmas. -I do.
But I don't hate you.
I don't want to lose you too.
I miss him too, son.
Promise you'll stay here tonight?
Yes.
Are you sure this is going to work? You could stay with us.
No, here I'm much more at ease.
And I'm here to babysit. Come on, Mom.
At home there are only girls busy making Christmas decorations.
Okay, then. But take it easy. And don't forget your medication.
-And the ointment for your shoulder. -Okay.
Take good care of him.
Wouldn't it be better if you stay with us?
Bye.
Yes.
I'll do it just once, until you get better.
Okay?
-Nice and cozy here, isn't it? -But where's here?
Here.
-How is this possible? -Hey.
Could you go and chat somewhere else? There are people trying to work.
-Relax. I have good news. -Good for you.
Here.
Holger…
-This is Jules. -We're behind schedule.
Yes, I know. That's why I brought Jules.
A child?
-Ikka, we're having a child. -What? A child? When?
-Now. -Okay, don't panic.
Towels, hot water, massage oil. Breathe steadily, Gunna. Breathe.
-Ikka, but it's… -Holger, leave this to the women.
Breathe with me, Gunna. Breathe.
And stay calm. Stay calm.
-Do you have a name, yet? -Yes, Jules.
Jules? Funny.
Oh, Mr. Claus. Where have you been all night?
We were so worried.
Dear Assa.
-That's… -Jules? The spitting image.
Yes. And Jules is here to help us.
Yes, because the doctors said Grandpa should take it easy.
-They don't know what they're saying. -But what are they saying, then?
-They don't know what they're saying. -But what are they saying, then? That Grandpa should rest.
There's nothing wrong. I just hurt my shoulder a bit.
Do you have a note from the doctor? I need it for my administration.
Holger.
Mr. Claus, put me down.
Alright, in your chair.
Ikka, blanket. Mr. Claus should rest.
Aye-aye. Will do.
Gunna, some tea?
Tea? But the steam makes my hair all frizzy.
No worries, Gunna. We won't drink tea here.
Ikka, get back here. Here. Land.
Listen, friends…
Due to my unnecessary stay in the hospital,
we lost a lot of precious time.
We need to roll up our sleeves.
Because tomorrow it's Christmas Eve already.
-Mr. Claus… No, you should rest. -Yes, and that's why I'm here.
-That's promising. -Holger.
-That's promising. -Holger. -What do I need to do? -Yes, what?
-What do I need to do? -Yes, what?
Jules has to learn everything from the beginning.
Oh, Mr. Claus, Mr. Claus. From the beginning? Please, allow me.
But of course.
A long, long time ago,
there was a big bang.
A gigantic, enormous bang.
-How does a person work here in peace? -Thank you, Gunna.
On second thought, due to our lack of time it might be best
-if he just learns it on the fly. -Very good idea. Ikka?
This won't work. -What? -This… is the end.
-What? -This… is the end.
Every ending is a new beginning.
Come on, Jules.
How does a person work here in peace?
Why are you so small?
-Whoa. -We're not small. -You're just big. -Come on. Can you believe him?
-You're just big. -Come on. Can you believe him?
It's a touchy subject.
And do you like working for Santa… for Grandpa?
-Working? -This isn't working.
-No, silly boy. -Christmas is the best.
Yes. Imagine… It's Christmas. Oh no, we need to work.
I hate Christmas.
-Isn't it beautiful? -This is so sweet.
Look at him.
This is so touching.
He hates Christmas. Hates.
It'll pass.
He isn't ready. This isn't a good idea.
He isn't ready. This isn't a good idea. -He'll come around, Assa. -And if he won't?
-He'll come around, Assa. -And if he won't?
-That's a thought for another day. -Grandpa.
Here you go, my assistant.
-Let's get to work. -Whoa, what's this?
-We're going to fill the bags. -No, those bags will remain empty.
-Take it easy, the doctor said. -I'm not doing anything.
-Take it easy, the doctor said. -I'm not doing anything. -I'll do it. -Come on. Here, Gunna. The list.
-I'll do it. -Come on. Here, Gunna. The list.
Thank you, Mr. Claus.
Wow.
-Nice, huh? -Yes.
-Come on, tell us, Gunna. -Let's see.
-Building blocks for Mila. -Building blocks.
Hey, over here. The blocks are here.
No, no.
-A little princess doll for Tommy. -Over there.
Gunna.
-A pool float for Dominique. -One pool float coming up. Catch.
-A pool float for Dominique. -One pool float coming up. Catch. Yes.
Bravissimo.
I'm sorry, Gunna. We don't have time for that.
I'm sorry, Gunna. We don't have time for that. -We need to get back to work. -No one wants to hear my talent.
-We need to get back to work. -No one wants to hear my talent.
Chocolate, marshmallows, gobstoppers and hard candy.
Hard candy? Come on, Jules. My favorite aisle.
Hard candy, hard candy. Hard candy.
Isn't it great?
Grab it, Jules. It's all yours. Come on.
Where are those two?
What did we say about using our phones at work?
-I'm worried about my son. -Just wait until your lunch break.
They're just busy. They can't hear you.
They can't be busy. Grandpa needs to rest.
They're just resting. They can't hear you.
Bad news. If we don't sell more Christmas cookies, the factory will close.
Bad news. If we don't sell more Christmas cookies, the factory will close. -I just heard it in the office. -But I've worked here all my life.
-I just heard it in the office. -But I've worked here all my life.
-People are fed up with those old cookies. -Then we should do something about it.
Tonight, my house. It's time for a cookie revolution.
Have you got more lists? -No.
Kids these days can't write. How am I supposed to read this?
Kids these days can't write. How am I supposed to read this? Give me that. It's a note from a four-year-old.
Give me that. It's a note from a four-year-old.
-There's a drawing on it. -You call that a drawing?
-Isn't it obvious? -I suppose it's my bad.
Holger… Come on.
Look, Otto wants a brother to play with.
Great. We don't need to teach him anything.
-Otto, colon, wants a brother. -Oh, a brother.
Yes, but wait. We're not going to give him a brother for Christmas.
Okay, so no brother.
Wait, we'll give him a soccer ball. That'll give him friends to play with.
Okay, soccer ball.
-Or a board game. -Of course. Yes.
-We'll never finish. -We will. Look at how far we've come.
I suppose the red ones haven't gotten a present, yet.
That's more than I thought.
But with you here, we'll make it tonight.
Tonight?
Oh, no. Mr. Claus needs to rest.
Assa, Santa does what needs to be done.
We'll leave Vienna together, then we'll head for Rome,
we'll make a slight turn for Paris and then we'll finish it off in London.
Wow. Performing in Vienna, Rome, Paris, London.
-Oh, what am I even doing here? -You're blocking my light.
How can a person work here peacefully?
We should get home before Mom arrives.
Jules?
Noël?
-Jules? -Mom's already here.
-Mom. -Oh, Jules. Finally.
I was so worried something had happened.
I was so worried something had happened. -Why aren't you answering the phone? -I didn't hear it. I was resting.
-Why aren't you answering the phone? -I didn't hear it. I was resting. Did you hear it?
-See you tomorrow? -See you tomorrow.
-Are you coming? -Yes.
-Are you coming? -Yes. Bye.
I don't know what you did, but thanks.
I didn't do anything.
Grandpa seemed really happy. I'm proud of you.
Button up your coat.
It's a good thing we moved here, right?
Closer to Grandpa. It's what Daddy wanted.
-How was work? -Good.
It takes some getting used to, but thankfully Fahrid is there. He's so funny.
It takes some getting used to, but thankfully Fahrid is there. He's so funny. Fahrid?
That's the guy who brought me to the hospital the other day.
He's really helping me.
-And Jet too. They're coming over tonight. -Why?
The factory is in big trouble,
and I have a plan to help them out with our Christmas cookies.
You like them too, don't you?
I know it's hard, but we really need to move on.
-Take an example… -We don't need to do anything.
Jules.
Mom, it's not a good time. -What's wrong, then? -Nothing.
-What's wrong, then? -Nothing.
So you want to bake your cookies instead of Jantien's,
and then smuggle them outside?
And put them in the shops instead of the old ones?
And hopefully everyone likes them.
One large order and the factory is saved.
This is ingenious.
-Or maybe a little bit too simple. -No, simple plans are the best.
Suzy, you're a goddess.
To the cookie revolution.
To the cookie revolution.
-Jet? -I don't know…
What if we fail?
We can't fail.
We need to brighten up these dark days.
I want to show Jules and Noor that you can't keep living in the past. You need to move on.
You need to move on. You need to start over, even if it's hard.
You need to start over, even if it's hard.
-What are you doing? -Nothing.
It's stuff for tomorrow at Grandpa's.
-What are you doing? -Nothing.
Noor…
Okay, but not too long.
-Will Santa come tonight? -Maybe. Good night.
Listen, his sleigh.
-Santa doesn't have a sleigh. -He does.
He doesn't. Good night.
-Then how will he visit us? -He has a snow…
He doesn't like kids being awake when he visits.
-Why not? -Just because. Go to sleep, now.
But I want to ask him something.
-What then? -If Daddy gets a present too.
-How are you feeling? -Fine, Assa.
But I mean really. How are you really feeling?
Jules is not the only one who's lost someone.
You miss him too, don't you?
Yes.
I miss him.
-But we need to get to work. -Whoa, pace yourself. Please.
-But we need to get to work. -Whoa, pace yourself. Please. But not too much, otherwise we aren't done by Easter.
But not too much, otherwise we aren't done by Easter.
Jules.
Jules.
-Are we going, or what? -Jules?
I thought you'd never come.
-So it's really real. -Yes, it's really real.
Why don't you wear a Christmas hat?
-Don't you like this? -I do.
-Ready? -No.
-Where are we going? -The Hoffmeyers.
-Where? -In Austria.
Can't we start with Noor's present?
-I always do yours at the end. -Okay.
Hans and Heinz.
for Heinz.
Hey, Jules. Don't touch anything.
-Für den Weihnachtsmann? -That's us.
We aren't supposed to touch anything.
Unless they put it there for us.
-Delphine… -Lecomte.
-Delphine… -Lecomte. -Yes. -That's a sweet little girl.
-Yes. -That's a sweet little girl. A toy car.
This one?
Give him your cookie.
I ate it.
-Are you sure they're not home? -They went skiing.
It's fun being Santa.
-Yes, another one. -And another one. Wow, that's quick.
Hey.
Could you please jump somewhere else?
Holger, just be happy for once. It's going great.
Great? They're back in a minute and I haven't finished my new list.
And who's fault is it, then?
We're done.
-Did you fill those bags already? -Not all, yet.
We're waiting for a new list. Holger can't keep up.
-Grandpa, are you coming? -Of course.
No, no, no.
What's on level -2?
On -2?
Oh… I don't know.
-Gunna? -Yes, Mr. Claus?
-What's on level -2? -On -2?
Books. Yes, a lot of books. Big, heavy books on…
math. Do you like math?
Yes, actually I do.
French. A lot of books on French.
-Do you like French? -No, not really.
-Wow, you worked really hard. -Yes.
Jules, do you like helping Santa?
-Yes, but I'm only doing it this once. -Yes, and that's great.
Mr. Claus, only once?
To London.
-Cookies for Santa? -No.
-What then? -Nothing.
See? You're not the only one.
-I suppose you can't bring back daddies. -I can't.
I want to go home.
Next one. Max from Uz… Uzbekistan.
He wants a pair of roller…
Ah? Back already?
Aren't you feeling well? Is it your shoulder? What's wrong?
He wants to go home.
I knew it. I warned you. It's too soon. He's…
We'll try again tomorrow, okay?
Try? We've got one day.
-One day. -Holger, come on. Max, Uzbekistan.
Come on, Jules. Yesterday you enjoyed yourself so much.
Grandpa will be very disappointed if you don't go.
-We're baking cookies today. -Fun.
Baking cookies.
What shall we have for dinner on Christmas Eve? Nothing complicated.
-Cookies. -Jules?
Jules. My drawing, my drawing. Jules.
Jules wrote on my drawing, Mom.
I don't want to celebrate Christmas. Is that so hard? Am I speaking Chinese?
I hate Jules. I hate him, I hate him.
My drawing…
That's 'hi, how are you doing' in Chinese, but that's all I know.
That's 'hi, how are you doing' in Chinese, but that's all I know. -So, how are you doing? -Crappy.
-So, how are you doing? -Crappy.
Well… I'm here, if you want to talk. -No, thanks.
Dad died last year. On Christmas Eve.
I miss him.
I never want it to be Christmas again. Mom and Noor act like nothing happened.
No one can force you to be happy or to do something you don't want.
-Especially when you're not ready. -And if you already said yes?
Doesn't matter. If you can't, you can't.
Hi, Grandpa.
How's your shoulder?
One more day of rest and then I'm all better.
Hello, Jules.
Jules, say hi to Grandpa.
I don't get it. Yesterday he was so happy and now…
I'll cheer him up.
I'm sorry. I would have left him at home…
Don't worry. We'll enjoy ourselves. Won't we, Jules?
Sorry.
Flippers, a microscope, coloring pencils.
Jules? Ju… Oh.
Jules, we need to hurry. The flippers are over there.
Jules, America is waiting.
America. Oh, Broadway.
Chicago, Chicago, Las Vegas.
Okay, next one. Microscope.
-Who would want that? -George. Eight years old, New York.
Oh, New York, New York.
A microscope might be fun at first, but soon he won't use it anymore.
I think George from New York might like a football better.
-Oh, son… -But he wants a microscope.
-Okay, next one. -Okay, coloring pencils.
There, those little boxes. Do you see them?
Get them yourself. Little people, little boxes.
-Come on. -We'll never finish.
We have a lot of toys to pack. A bicycle helmet, a puzzle, a teddy bear.
No, Jules. Not a skateboard. No, not a skateboard.
We really need to get a move on.
Race you through the corridor. Get set, go.
Jules.
-That's not fair. I wasn't ready. -Ikka, no.
Not one at a time. Is that clear?
Yes, ma'am.
Need help?
-If she sees this, I'm out. -Either way. They'll close the factory.
Take a bit of this and smooth it out.
-What do we do? -Everything for the cookie revolution.
-Jet, what are you doing? -Jet?
Jet, are you allowed to have a sanitary break? Jet?
Make sure she doesn't see you.
You saved us.
I actually need to use the toilet, now.
-It couldn't have been that bad. -It was terrible.
He still hates Christmas from the bottom of his heart.
-Jules, done already? -I want to go home.
But we still need to deliver all those presents in America.
But we still need to deliver all those presents in America. -You do it. -But Jules…
-You do it. -But Jules…
No one can force me to do anything.
Will you bring me home?
I'm not giving up yet.
He just needs a little push.
And how are you going to do that?
I won't bore you with that.
-Want to join? -No.
But these are cookie revolution cookies.
Your Mom's a true hero. She's going to turn the whole factory upside down.
-Hello? -Jules?
-Hi, Granny. -Is Mom around?
I don't know.
-Are you home alone? -No.
-Has she already bought a tree? -No.
But I'm sure she did some shopping to make a delicious dinner tonight.
But I'm sure she did some shopping to make a delicious dinner tonight. She didn't? I'm disappointed. But maybe she's out doing groceries right now.
She didn't? I'm disappointed. But maybe she's out doing groceries right now.
-Maybe, I don't know. -Okay.
-Alright. -Bye, Granny.
Grandpa?
-Jules. Pssh, Jules. -Gunna?
-Oh, hi. -What are you doing here?
Oh, Jules. Something terrible happened. A disastrous catastrophe.
-It's all really bad. -What is it?
I wasn't there myself. I wasn't there when it happened. Oh, no.
I wasn't there myself. I wasn't there when it happened. Oh, no. If I had been there, I could have done something. I don't know what…
If I had been there, I could have done something. I don't know what…
If I had been there, I could have done something. I don't know what… Gunna, Gunna. Calm down.
Gunna, Gunna. Calm down.
What happened?
Mr. Claus went on his rounds alone.
And he…
fell.
Jules, make sure to keep a close eye on Grandpa.
-Do we really need to move? -That way we're closer to Grandpa.
I promised Daddy we'd take good care of him.
It was his last wish.
Jules, Jules… Oh no, I broke him.
Jules, Jules… Oh no, I broke him. Jules, do something. Don't just stand there. Jules.
Jules, do something. Don't just stand there. Jules.
Jules. Oh, thank God. Jules, we need to leave immediately. Right now.
-Okay. -Now.
-Hey, sweetheart. -We made cookies.
-Hello. Who are you? -Ella, the babysitter.
-Where's Jules? -Upstairs.
-Yes, Mom? -Twenty-two? She's barely fourteen.
Fifteen.
-Shame on you. -This is not a good time.
-Not a good time? Where's Jules? -With Grandpa Belgium.
No, there's no one home. And he isn't at your place either.
You don't even know where your kids are.
I'm on my way.
-Sorry, I need to go home. Jules is gone. -What's this?
My son…
-Oh, Grandpa. Does it hurt? -Yes.
But all that's broken can be fixed, right?
How could you be so stupid to go alone…
Stupid? I had no choice.
As Santa, it's my duty to bring presents to the people.
I know you see it differently, but I don't.
Could you give me my cane and help me up?
-I'll do it. Grandpa, stay there. Easy. -I have to go.
I never should have left you.
Dad, he…
You stay here, okay?
I'll do it. Alone.
-Are the bags for America ready? -Almost.
-We'll do it right away. -Are they done?
-No, but don't worry. -Don't worry.
Did you really think I wouldn't recognize these coloring books?
You're lucky I can't afford losing any of you,
You're lucky I can't afford losing any of you, otherwise you'd be on the street. All of you.
otherwise you'd be on the street. All of you.
-I need to find Jules. -Go. We'll cover for you.
Sure? I don't want you to get fired.
-No, find your son. -I'm sorry for all this.
All this? I've never experienced anything more amusing. Just go.
We've been producing these Christmas cookies for over 30 years.
Traditions need to be retained. Not destroyed.
I'll give you one last chance.
You get four hours to make all the cookies.
You should start right away.
It's much too big.
One day, it'll fit you, Jules.
Here you go.
Okay, but I'll only do this once.
Wait, Jules. It'll be incredible. You look radiant.
Radiant or not, we'll never make up for that lost time.
Of course we will. You just have to believe in it.
-Wat are you doing? -Believing in it. And look.
No, didn't work.
Jules, be careful.
Jules.
Yes, I knew it. I knew he could do it.
-Jules, we love you. -Aren't you in pain anymore?
-Jules, we love you. -Aren't you in pain anymore? -Is your leg healed? -That happened really fast.
-Is your leg healed? -That happened really fast.
Oh, look.
It's Suzanne.
-Did you find him? -No, I don't know where he is.
He won't do anything stupid.
-Could I use your car? -The nerve.
-Fahrid? Hello? -Suzanne.
First you get the factory into trouble and then you leave without permission.
I'll be back as soon as I find Jules.
Get here now, or we don't need you back.
I'm going to find my son.
And I'm going to help her.
Me too.
Then you're fired. You're all fired.
Start baking.
-So you lied. -I didn't have a choice, Assa.
He isn't ready, I told you. But no, 'I hurt my leg'.
He isn't ready, I told you. But no, 'I hurt my leg'. You lied to get him to take over while he doesn't even want to.
You lied to get him to take over while he doesn't even want to.
That's not true. He does want it. He just doesn't know it, yet.
He needs to learn how to love Christmas again. That's all.
Jules. Stop him.
Stay. Jules, come back.
Stay. Jules, come back. Stop.
Don't go to level -2.
He went to level -2, Mr. Claus.
Elisabeth Claus.
Wilhelmus Claus.
Otto Claus.
Henricus Claus.
Virginie Claus.
Grandpa.
Dad…
I'm sorry, Jules. Calm down.
I'm sorry, Jules. Calm down. I'm sorry. I really hoped you'd start loving Christmas again.
I'm sorry. I really hoped you'd start loving Christmas again.
Then it would have been easier to explain…
all this.
As long as we can remember, the role of Father or Mother Christmas
As long as we can remember, the role of Father or Mother Christmas is passed down in our family for generations.
is passed down in our family for generations. -The Claus family. -But Santa lives forever.
-The Claus family. -But Santa lives forever.
No, son.
Look at me. No.
We'll all grow old and then the next one will take over.
Your dad had already taken over from me…
when…
-His accident. -Yes.
And I thought you were too young,
so I decided to do it myself.
But son…
I'm old, Jules. My best days are over.
That fall, the hospital.
Here. A letter from your dad.
He wrote it for you.
All Santas wrote letters like these to their successors.
Because one day you will be the new Santa.
No, I was only going to help you once.
Dad is dead, so Santa is too.
Eleven, blond hair. Yes, no. This afternoon.
Eleven, blond hair. Yes, no. This afternoon. Yes. Yes, okay. Thank you.
Yes. Yes, okay. Thank you. They'll go look for him.
Hey, it'll all be alright. It'll be alright.
Jules.
Jules, where were you? We've looked all over for you.
-Where's Grandpa? -At home.
Why aren't you with him? You were taking care of him.
You're so selfish, sometimes.
The lost son has returned.
Everyone was so worried.
Jules, don't be like that.
You said no one could force me to be happy.
There's a difference between not being happy,
and terrorizing everyone with your self-pity.
-Your Mom lost her job because of you. -What?
-I never should have said that. -We all make mistakes. Moms too.
So you think I made a mistake.
No, you're doing the best you can. Jules knows that.
-What's that? -Nothing.
From my dad.
Shouldn't you open it?
Why not?
Because it's a goodbye letter.
If I read it…
Then it's really over.
Learn to let go.
What do you know about that? You still have your dad. I don't.
I lost everything.
No more ballet.
No more short skirts.
A stupid accident.
It's no one's fault.
Being mad at the world doesn't change anything.
You still have so much, Jules.
Open it and read it, please.
Just go and talk to him, okay?
Okay.
-I'm sorry about just now. -I'm sorry too.
Did you really get fired because of me?
Of course not. I've been stupid.
Simple plans aren't always the best plans.
I thought I could save the factory on my own,
and that everyone would like our cookies.
One large order and then…
Oh, well…
You just wanted to brighten up the dark days.
Jules, when you read this, I'm no longer around for some reason.
This isn't a goodbye letter. It's a new beginning.
Just like Grandpa took over the job from his dad,
you're going to retain the tradition.
I'm not around anymore, but I'll always be a part of you.
Now you must bring light to the darkness. You're my beating heart.
Together we're Santa, forever.
Jules?
I have to go, but they can't know.
-Where are you going? -Letting go and retaining tradition.
-Where are you going? -Letting go and retaining tradition. -What? -I'm saving Christmas.
-What? -I'm saving Christmas.
-Is everything alright? -I've never felt so good.
-Thanks so much. -For what?
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
-Why are you so sad? -Jules. He's back, he's back.
There's a celebration of a new beginning.
-Really? Truly? -Let's get to work.
-Really? Truly? -Let's get to work. -Oh, guys. -We're off. We're off.
-Oh, guys. -We're off. We're off.
The spitting image.
Welcome, Santa Jules.
It's about time, huh?
Jules, are you sure you don't need me there?
I wanted to make a short detour.
One that isn't really good for your health.
Oh, do I need to worry?
Long live the cookie revolution.
Can someone tell me what a cookie revolution is?
It tastes like Christmas.
One large order.
Enjoy, Madam President.
Do you want one? Tastes good, huh?
-Yes, we love Jules. -We love you.
Cool, isn't it, Holger?
-Careful. -Beautiful, Holger.
Jules.
The colored cookies. Sure.
The colored cookies. The colored cookies…
Where are the colored cookies? Hey, where are the colored ones?
Why won't anyone answer me?
I'm going to check on Jules. No, I just went. He wanted to stay in his room a little longer.
No, I just went. He wanted to stay in his room a little longer.
Oh, okay.
He isn't going to be moping in his room all night?
Mommy, I'm hungry.
-What are your ideas for dinner? -I don't know.
-Did you buy anything? -No.
I'll go.
I just hadn't gotten to it with everything going on.
Noor, we're going to do the groceries so we can cook Christmas dinner.
-Spaghetti. -Well…
You need to come back. Madam President wants your cookies.
What? That's impossible.
She made a large order for her presidential Christmas dinner.
If we do this right, we'll be her regular supplier and then the factory is saved.
-They'll need to be shipped tonight. -Tonight?
-Sorry, but I can't. -Why not?
Because we're celebrating Christmas. I promised.
We can do that tomorrow.
-Do you mean that? -Yes.
-Okay, who's in? -I am.
-Okay, who's in? -I am. I'm not. I'm going shopping with Granny. Ella can come too.
I'm not. I'm going shopping with Granny. Ella can come too.
-This will never work. -At least we tried.
-Need help? -Shouldn't you be celebrating Christmas?
Yes, so crack your whip, so we'll all be in time for Christmas dinner.
Come on.
-Jantien, where's the dough? -I'm working on it.
Just because I ask a question, doesn't mean I want an answer. Start baking.
Jantien, come on.
-Was that the last one? -Only one house. In London.
-Why is he taking so long? -I can't watch.
Come on, Jules. Come on, Jules.
-Come on, be more cheerful. -Good job, son. Good job.
Jules, how did you learn all that so fast?
-I mostly learned that Dad's in my heart. -Of course, son.
I always knew you had it in you. You can do it.
-We're ready. -No, we're not.
We've done it.
-Merry Christmas, everyone. -Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Come on.
What's wrong? Jules?
It'll be okay.
Merry Christmas.
Did you do this?
What's this?
A Christmas tree and so many presents.
Wow.
Jules. Oh my…
Saving Christmas?
Ella, there's one for you.
Look.
Look. Alright, I'm off.
Great, huh?
Fahrid, wait. Come on.
Careful, guys. It's very hot.
Bravo.
-Delicious. -It's snowing.
I'd like to make a toast to a beautiful, white Christmas.
Cheers.
To a white Christmas.
My mom used to say, "Life is like golgappas.
Your tummy may be full, but your heart always craves more."
Greetings.
Myself Laal. Laal Singh Chaddha.
Your shoes are so nice!
So clean! I can almost see myself in them.
My mom used to say, "Shoes are like an identity card.
Judge a man by his shoes, not his face."
They're old, aren't they?
The thing is…
I love them.
You know I've worn many shoes in life…
but I still remember my first pair.
My mom used to say they were magic shoes.
Okay, Laal. Ready?
These are magic shoes, Laal.
Laal… -try walking. -Careful.
-Come on. -Very good.
Go. Slowly.
There you go. Happy?
I told you his legs are just fine.
It's his mind that has the problem.
Laal!
My name wasn't always Laal.
Laal was my grandpa's name.
The year I was born, my grandpa went to Pakistan…
to fight a war.
But he never returned.
My great-grandpa… didn't return from World War II.
And my great-great-grandpa… didn't return from World War I.
All three of them were called Laal.
Mom was very proud of all three of them.
So, she named me Laal too.
Looking handsome, Laal!
Here you go, ma'am.
The government is offering big discounts on pesticides.
Use this, it'll double your harvest. This is Sumati Nandan reading the afternoon news.
This is Sumati Nandan reading the afternoon news.
The Prime Minister of India, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, has announced an end to the national emergency.
has announced an end to the national emergency.
Finally, the emergency has ended. Thank God.
Laal, hold this.
-Come. -Let me help you.
Hey, mind your business. He's capable. He'll do it.
Listen, Laal. There's nothing that you can't do.
You don't need anyone's help.
If God wanted to make everyone the same,
he would not have created so many people, right?
My mom used to explain everything really well.
She was very smart.
She managed the entire farm by herself.
We lived in Karoli… about ten kilometers from Pathankot.
We stayed in my mom's family home.
My grandpa, my great-grandpa, or my great-great-grandpa…
one of them built it.
Phuphi!
Come.
Laal, always remember…
you're absolutely fine. You're just like the other kids. You're no different.
Your child is different.
Look, ma'am. Some children are very intelligent.
Some are normal,
and some are below normal.
Like your Laal.
We cannot enroll him in our school.
Put him in a school for dimwits.
My son is not a dimwit.
He understands everything. It just takes him a little longer.
He should be given the same opportunities as other kids.
Look, you already hounded me in school.
Now, you have come to my house on a Sunday!
I have to go to church. My maid hasn't come in days.
My cook has eloped. I'm doing the dishes myself!
You know how difficult it is to get home help, right?
Please leave, and don't come back.
Not even to school.
Wait here.
I'll come and cook for you every day.
I'll clean your house and even do the dishes.
What does the child's father do?
He lives abroad.
You seem to be affluent. Will you really do my dishes,
You seem to be affluent. Will you really do my dishes, cook, and clean?
Yes. For as long as my Laal is in your school.
You don't give up, do you? Here.
Your mother wants the best for you.
Make sure you study hard.
My first day of school…
was the scariest day of my life… and the best.
Look, Laal. You have to work really hard.
You have to do better than your best.
Shall I go?
Don't go. Please.
Hey, come on. I'll come to get you in the evening.
Please don't leave, Mom.
Just for today.
All right. I'll wait here.
Once your school is over, come here.
Off you go.
My friend sits here.
Not here! Move along!
It's so strange.
We just can't seem to control our memories.
I don't remember the moment I was born.
I don't remember my first Diwali… or the first paratha I ate.
But… I clearly remember the moment I heard
the sweetest voice…
in the whole wide world.
You can sit here.
Such a pretty face!
I had never seen anything so beautiful.
What are you staring at? Sit down.
What's up with your legs?
Nothing. I'm perfectly fine.
Where do you stay?
At home.
Are you dumb?
No. I'm perfectly fine.
Her laughter warmed my heart.
What's your name?
Myself Laal. Laal Singh Chaddha.
Myself Rupa. Rupa D'Souza.
From that moment, we became friends.
Rupa lived in Karoli too.
Other than my mom, no one spoke to me so much.
Rupa and I always used to be together.
Like carrots and peas.
Ever since I saw you
I can't stop looking at you
I just can't seem to get enough
What should I do?
I love chatting with you
I stay up thinking of you
I think I'm going nuts
What should I do?
Life stops when you are not around
And when you're around I can't take my eyes off you
You are my most favorite person
In the whole wide world
That's how much I love you
What should I do?
Rupa was an amazing magician.
She could pluck a plane out of the sky and stuff it in her pocket.
She taught me to climb trees,
and I taught her to hang from them.
She taught me to read English,
and I taught her to catch flies.
Life stops when you are not around
And when you're around I can't take my eyes off you
You are my most favorite person
In the whole wide world
That's how much I love you
What should I do?
Sometimes, we'd just sit on our tree silently…
waiting for the stars.
Shall we go home? It's getting dark.
Wait just a little longer, please.
Okay.
I don't know why, but Rupa never liked going back home.
My mom bought the first TV in our village.
The whole village came over to watch the TV.
Rupa… will you marry me?
India won the World Cup!
India won!
She was my best friend.
My only friend.
Rupa.
Rupa.
My aunt's name was also Rupa.
My aunt's name is Manjeet.
She used to live in Amritsar.
We often visited her.
Once, when we reached Amritsar station,
I saw lots of soldiers there.
Greetings.
Mom.
Laal… come with me.
That night, the lights went out…
and didn't come back for the next four-five days.
Over the next few days, many explosions happened.
It felt as if the earth was trembling.
Like it was an earthquake.
Mom was really upset.
Don't go out.
Why, Mom?
Well…
there's a malaria epidemic out there.
Don't go out.
During that time, we didn't leave the house at all.
Son, does your aunt still live in Amritsar?
No, sir. She moved to Delhi soon after.
The first time I went to Delhi was to visit her.
I liked to hang out with my cousin and his friends.
They would dance to film songs. I liked that.
Look!
Look how the cripple is dancing! Look!
What a clown!
One of the boys really liked my moves.
Hey, why did you stop?
That's a great move. Show me.
I taught him my favorite move.
He went on to become a very popular actor.
I've seen many of his films.
Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kal Ho Na Ho,
Main Hoon Na,
DDLJ.
Who? Shah Rukh Khan?
Yes, Shah Rukh Khan! Such a lovely fellow!
He's from Delhi.
-Have you been to Delhi? -No, I haven't.
You know I've seen every corner of Delhi.
Thanks to my aunt. She was our guide.
This is the PM's residence.
Indira Gandhi lives here.
Forget all that. Look there. Smile.
Suddenly, one day, I heard those explosions again.
Indira Gandhi…
the ruler of the world's largest democracy died today,
shot down by two of her own bodyguards.
They were Sikhs, taking revenge, for the invasion of their temple in June.
That evening, we left to take the train back home.
Suddenly, some people came running towards our auto-rickshaw.
Oh, Lord!
Madam, take the child and run.
Laal, come on! Hurry up!
I don't know why they were so angry with us.
We had never even met them before.
Let's go.
Mom ran away with me.
Hurry up.
Laal, this way.
Hide, Laal. Come on.
Hide, Laal. Come on. Come.
Sit here. Good boy.
Quiet. Keep quiet.
Don't let him get away!
-Get him! -Kill him!
Lord, please forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Maybe they didn't like my long hair.
That's why Mom cut it off.
Mom said that the explosions we had heard that day
were actually bullets.
Our Prime Minister was killed by them.
Those were terrible days.
Even I was in Delhi at that time.
It's a miracle… that I'm here today.
Yes! My mom used to say,
"Life is full of miracles."
Some people don't believe in them,
but I can tell you that miracles do happen.
-Hey, dumbo! -Got him!
Stupid fellow!
Laal. Hey, Laal.
-What a shot! -Laal, are you hurt?
Aim for his skull, boys!
Why are you hurting him?
Because it's fun!
-Laal, run! -Where will the idiot run to?
-Hey, catch him! -He's running away!
-Hey, catch him! -He's running away! -Catch him! -Catch the cripple!
You think you can run? -We won't spare you! -Where will you go?
You're going to get it good!
Run, Laal, run!
Run, Laal, run!
I know you won't believe me, but I run faster than the wind.
And from that day on, I ran everywhere.
One day, Rupa didn't come to school.
So, I ran all the way to her house.
Hey! Give me ten rupees!
-I don't have any. -I know you do.
-I really don't have any. -Give me money!
I said, give me the money!
-Didn't you hear what I said? -Laal, do you have ten rupees?
Dad wants it.
I know you have more money! Where is it? Tell me!
-Speak up! -That's Rupa's school fees.
Give it to me now! I won't.
Oh Lord, please make me rich. Oh Lord, please make me rich.
-Oh Lord, please make me rich. -Oh Lord, please make Rupa rich.
-Oh Lord, please make Rupa rich. -Give me the money right now, or else--
That day, Lord didn't make her rich…
but another miracle happened.
Rupa's mother had eloped with a Christian man.
And because of that, Rupa's grandma had broken off ties with her.
After her mother's death,
the police took Rupa to her grandma.
And you know who her grandmother was?
Our home help, Phuphi.
You see? Miracles do happen.
Rupa started staying with us.
I was very happy. But Rupa remained sad.
Sometimes, she would have nightmares.
Then, she would come and sleep next to me.
When we got older, Mom sent Rupa and me
to a college in Delhi.
-Mr. Advani, we are with you! -There was a huge chariot on the streets.
Lots of people had gathered. Even we went to check it out.
-With your support, -Mr. Advani, we are with you! Mr. Lal Krishna Advani is embarking on his Chariot Tour.
He's your namesake.
Really?
Lal Krishna Advani.
Even in Delhi, Rupa and I were always together.
Like carrots and peas.
Got him!
-Hey, what are you doing? -Hey, Laal.
But those bullies from our village were also studying in our college.
Why are you throwing stones at him?
-Hey, come on! -Run, Laal, run!
He's running away. Start the car.
Get in.
Move it!
Get him!
Run, Laal, run!
How fast can you run?
We're coming, love. Wait for us!
Almost there!
On your mark, set…
He's flying like a rocket. Who is he?
Sir, Laal Singh.
He's a dimwit.
Dimwit or not, he runs fast.
Bring him to me.
Athletes, on your mark!
-Laal Singh! -Laal Singh!
-Laal Singh! -Laal Singh!
-Laal Singh! -Laal Singh!
-Laal Singh! -Laal Singh!
Set!
-Laal Singh! -Laal Singh!
-Why isn't he running? -Run, Laal, run!
-Run, Laal, run! -Run, Laal, run!
-Run, Laal, run! -Run, Laal, run!
-Run, Laal, run! -Run, Laal, run!
Why isn't he stopping?
Laal!
I was really enjoying myself.
I would run a little, and they'd put me on these steps
and garland me.
Laal Singh! Laal!
Run as soon as you hear the gunshot!
Don't stop, boy! Best of luck! Come on!
-Laal Singh! -Laal Singh!
-Set. -Laal Singh!
Run, Laal, run!
-Run, Laal, run! -Run, Laal, run!
-Run, Laal, run! -Run, Laal, run!
-Run, Laal, run! -Run, Laal, run!
You can stop now!
You won the race!
I joined the National Cadet Corps in college.
I participated in the parade every year.
And Rupa participated in some walking contest.
All of a sudden, the University closed for the holidays.
-Down with the Mandal Commission! -Down with the Mandal Commission!
-VP Singh, step down! -VP Singh, step down!
Do you remember what we spoke about yesterday? I hope you do.
What?
Hello. Greetings.
Laal, can you get me some golgappas, please?
Sure.
Where were we?
Thank you.
Rupa loved golgappas. And I loved Rupa.
Tomorrow, I promise. Not today.
-Rupa, you're breaking your promise. -Tomorrow.
Please. Just once, Rupa. No. Not today.
-We'll do it tomorrow. -Promise?
Yes, I promise--
-Laal! -Rupa!
Laal, what are you doing?
Stay away!
-Who is this crazy person? -He isn't crazy. He's my friend.
He's a little slow. Sorry.
Well, stay with him then! I'm leaving!
Harry, wait!
Look what you've done! Why did you hit him?
He was troubling you.
He wasn't.
Do you know how rich he is?
No, how rich is he?
Rupa, golgappas?
You should've got the spiced water separately.
You're right.
Laal…
Rupa…
will you marry me?
Laal, I want to go to Mumbai.
I want to become a model and then an actress.
I'll become famous and very rich.
What will you do, Laal?
Mom says I should join the Army.
But I don't like killing anyone.
So, Rupa went to Mumbai?!
She didn't even answer your question.
Sorry, that's my station.
-I'll have to leave. -Bye, Uncle.
I was in college around the same time. I still remember.
We would get so many days off.
Yes, and when there were no holidays…
there would be a malaria problem.
-Malaria? -Yes.
Mumbai is afire with rioting.
The reason being the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.
We are receiving reports of many being injured.
Today, the government has announced a curfew.
The effects of the Mumbai riots are being felt nationwide.
Laal Singh Chaddha!
-Hello. -Laal.
-Mom. -Son, just stay in your room…
-Mom. -Son, just stay in your room… for one week.
What happened, Mom?
Well…
malaria is spreading again.
Oh, okay.
Laal, why didn't you come to practice today?
Sir, I can't come out.
Malaria is spreading in the country.
Malaria?
He's stupid, sir.
This afternoon, multiple bomb explosions have shaken the city of Mumbai.
The first bomb went off at 1:30 p.m. at the Bombay Stock Exchange.
The last one took place at Hotel Airport Centaur. Other than that…
Laal Singh Chaddha!
-Laal. -Mom.
Son, don't get out of your room for a week.
What happened, Mom?
Well… it's malaria again.
Oh, okay.
Laal, open the door! You have a race today!
Sir, I can't come out.
Malaria is spreading again.
It's the Nationals! Open up!
No, sir. Mom said no going out.
Talk to him!
I told you he's stupid. Shut up!
Well, I didn't know it would be so easy to graduate from the university.
I ran through it.
From the BA program, Laal Singh Chaddha.
Mom used to say that every man from our family served in the Army.
So, it was natural for me to join the Army as well.
Greetings, sir. Myself Laal. Laal Singh Chaddha.
So? What are you grinning about?
Go, sit!
This seat is taken.
This one too. Go to the back.
I got scared.
I was scolded on the first day of my training.
I didn't even have a friend there.
Come, sit here.
Do you wear underpants?
Yes.
Which one? A-front or V-front?
I'm not sure, brother. I wear whatever Mom buys for me.
Undergarments are very important for a man.
I have been making my own since childhood.
My grandfather was an undergarments expert.
My name is Balaraju. I'm from Bodipalem.
Everyone calls me Bala.
Myself Laal Singh Chaddha.
I'm from Karoli, Pathankot.
-Everyone calls me Laal. -Okay.
-Pleased to meet you. -Same here.
Bala's family was in the undergarments business.
His grandpa stitched undergarments for freedom fighters.
His great-grandpa made undergarments for the British.
And his great-great-grandpa
used to tailor undergarments for kings and nawabs.
He knew everything about undergarments.
I know everything about undergarments.
After serving in the Army, I will start my undergarments business.
Laal Singh Chaddha!
Yes, sir!
As an army officer, what is your duty?
Sir, to follow your orders!
Bloody hell. You're a genius.
Genius!
Did you know that you are a genius, Laal?
No, sir. I just found out.
Genius.
Did you hear that? That's a genius.
You must follow my orders…
I found school tough,
but the Army was really easy.
I just had to remember a few things.
Make a tidy bed.
Stand straight.
And answer every question with…
-Sir, yes, sir! -Sir, yes, sir!
Brother…
your vest is wrongly cut.
Look, it's loose here and tight here.
Look at mine.
See the fit.
The armhole doesn't stretch.
Very comfortable.
Even your underpants are wrongly cut.
-Oh! -Look at mine.
My grandpa made it.
It's lovely.
There's not a man in my village…
who doesn't wear undergarments made by my grandpa.
-The weapon is ready, sir. -What?
My God! You've broken the record!
-How did you finish it so quickly? -You said to do it quickly, sir.
Bloody hell! You're a genius! Genius!
Do it again!
Yes, sir!
Genius.
Genius.
Genius. Genius.
As I was saying…
now, there are newer fabrics available to make undergarments.
I want to make undergarments that stay dry even when you sweat.
They'll really sell.
Tell me, brother,
have you ever met a man who doesn't wear undergarments?
Even a homeless beggar who doesn't own anything
wears undergarments.
Life isn't comfortable without good undergarments.
Life is a reflection of your undergarments.
I want to make all types of undergarments.
One for the winter and one for the summer.
One for sports and one for sleep.
And a special pair for honeymooners.
Do you want to learn?
Sure.
Bala taught me to make undergarments,
and I made my first vest for him.
I made the second one for Lieutenant.
Genius!
They became very popular,
and I spent every holiday making them for everyone.
Switch on the TV quickly. The Miss Universe pageant is on.
The first runner-up is…
Miss Columbia!
That means, Sushmita Sen, Miss India…
you are the new Miss Universe 1994.
Congratulations, Miss India Sushmita Sen, you are the new Miss Universe 1994.
The stage is yours for the traditional walk.
Everyone in the Army gets really lonely at night.
I missed Rupa terribly.
I hadn't heard from her ever since she had gone to Mumbai.
Laal, look. Two naked people and a snake.
Lucky snake!
The news said that Rupa was in trouble.
Apparently, people didn't like some pictures of hers.
So, the police put her in prison.
I was very worried about her.
I took leave and went to Mumbai.
-Rupa D'Souza! -Shame! Shame!
-Rupa D'Souza! -Shame! Shame!
-Rupa D'Souza! -Shame! Shame!
-Rupa! -Hey, sexy! If you like posing nude, why don't you strip for me?
If you like posing nude, why don't you strip for me?
Hey, why did you hit him?
Hey, how dare you!
Laal!
Laal!
Laal!
Laal!
Laal!
What was the need for all this?
You can't keep landing up everywhere to save me.
He was… saying bad things about you.
So what? A lot of people say bad things about me.
Who all will you save me from? Everyone.
-Really? -Yes.
Rupa.
Rupa…
will you marry me?
-Do you even know what marriage means? -Yes, I do.
We're very different from each other, Laal.
I don't want an ordinary life.
I want to make it really big.
Make a lot of money.
But I don't know where to start.
I really like you, Laal.
But we'll always be just friends.
I should go now.
In a few days, I'll be posted.
I don't know where.
Listen, be careful.
Don't try to be brave.
If it gets too dangerous, just run.
Got it?
Rupa!
I'll write letters to you every day.
Let's go.
With that… Rupa left.
Abbas… this is Rupa.
I had told you about her.
She wants to be a heroine.
Bala and I finished our training in 1995.
He got married a year later.
I had not seen Rupa in four years.
Missing home? Me too.
My family.
Chithra. Bhawani. Banu.
-Junior Bala. -Yes.
Junior Bala.
I've been wanting to ask you something.
-May I? -Yes.
Will you be my business partner?
I've thought a lot about it.
After serving in the Army, we can start an undergarments business.
I have a foolproof plan. Here.
You take care of manufacturing, and I'll do the marketing.
We need to invest only 100,000 rupees.
Three sewing machines will cost us 30,000.
You run one machine, and we'll hire two tailors.
You'll stitch 20 sets of undergarments a day,
and the tailors will do ten each.
That's 1000 a month. Right?
From the next month onward, we will easily sell 800 sets.
I think we'll see profits in three months.
-How's my plan? -Very good.
So, will you become my partner?
-Okay. -Really?
The following day, we were sent on a mission.
We were posted in Kargil those days.
Captain told us that some enemies had entered our territory.
We had to get rid of them.
You don't like to kill anyone, do you?
Me neither.
We're both the same. A perfect pair…
like underpants and a vest.
Brothers forever.
Local shepherds informed us…
that five-six enemy soldiers had set up a bunker in our territory.
Those local shepherds came along to guide us.
I thought of my grandpas.
They must have also fought such wars.
Up there.
Papa Oscar 1, go to the left toward those rocks.
And Papa Oscar 2, toward the right…
Captain sent two teams of six each
to the left and right for covering fire.
In the center was the attacking team.
Bala and I were on the attacking team.
We took cover behind rocks and made our way up.
Wait.
Let the lowlifes come closer.
We didn't know then, but the enemies were not just six.
There were many of them.
Fire!
He's hurt.
There was a barrage of bullets.
Fire! Keep firing!
There's a whole battalion of them.
Smoke cover!
Boys, give me smoke cover! Come on!
Sir.
Inform the Bofors Gun Position to start firing at point 3928.
-In exactly five minutes. -Roger, sir.
Tango 1! Over!
Go for the gun position!
Bofors fire required on point 3928 in five minutes.
Roger! Confirming artillery fire on point 3928 in five minutes!
All teams, fall back.
All teams, fall back! Right away!
Bofors firing to start on point 3928 in five minutes!
Right after the firing, we will attack again!
We will take back this camp today!
Laal!
They're falling back.
They're falling back. Follow me.
Give him cover!
Laal!
Laal!
Hurry up!
Laal!
Laal, are you okay?
Are you okay? Are you hurt?
Come on, Laal, get up! Let's go!
Bofors firing is going to start in less than five minutes.
Hurry up, Laal! Come on!
Laal.
Laal!
Run, Laal, run!
I ran.
Just as Rupa had told me to, I ran.
I ran fast, but after some time, I realized that I was running alone.
Bala?
I didn't know where Bala was.
So, I ran back to find him.
Bala!
Every time I would go back to find Bala,
someone would ask me for help.
I saw my grandpas in every wounded person.
It was one such war they never returned from.
Laal, where are you going?
Bala!
Are you crazy?
Bofors firing is going to start any second.
The mountain is dangerous.
Bala! My brother!
Bala.
Laal.
What's this?
You're hurt very badly.
Don't worry. I'm here now.
Bala was hurt very badly.
I carried him and ran.
Out of nowhere, a bee stung me.
I won't let anything happen to you.
Brother…
Why did this happen, Laal?
Laal…
I want to go home.
I want to go to my mother.
Bala. My brother.
Bala. My brother.
All Bala wanted was to go back home and start a business.
But he died in Kargil.
That's all I have to say about that.
The war ended a few days later.
Everyone was celebrating our victory.
But I couldn't stop thinking about Bala.
Uncle, was it a bullet?
The bee sting. Wasn't that a bullet?
Yes.
Where did you get shot?
-On my bum. Would you like to see it? -No, it's fine.
There's one perk of getting shot in the bum.
Ice lollies.
I used to have 18 lollies in a day.
Greetings. Myself Laal. Laal Singh Chaddha.
Hello, Mohammad Paaji.
Ice lolly?
Take it, Mohammad Paaji.
Banu Chandar.
Raman Kumar.
Satyajit Pande.
Moinak Banerjee.
Kulwinder Bakshish.
Manoj Moily.
Hemant Pandey.
Shahid Hussain.
Laal Singh Chaddha.
Laal Singh Chaddha!
All my letters came back.
Perhaps, Rupa hadn't gone home in many days.
Yes, Rohit. Done. We'll shoot in Switzerland.
Okay, bye.
Sir, good news.
We've got Rohit Kumar's dates from next month.
-Congratulations! -Cheers! Cheers!
-Congratulations, Abbas. -Who'd dare turn Abbas down!
I'm the heroine in this film, right?
Do you want to be Rohit's heroine or mine?
Tell me.
Boss has got style. Drama even in romance.
I'm your heroine, of course.
Wow! That's true love.
Go, get me a drink.
Sir, you know what?
Priya is pretty popular nowadays. Yes, Priya will be good.
Yes, Priya will be good. Call her.
Has anyone seen that local Mohammad?
He's missing since morning.
Something's wrong.
I can't find his record.
The information he gave is incorrect. And now, he's missing.
Whom did you save, Laal?
Yes, sir. Yes.
Naik Laal Singh Chaddha. The Commanding Officer wants to see you.
Naik Laal Singh…
you are being awarded the Veer Chakra for saving five lives.
You must head to Delhi.
Yes, sir.
How is your butt, by the way?
It hurts sometimes, sir.
Your medical category has been permanently downgraded.
You can't fight in a war again.
You can ask them to discharge you from the Army on medical grounds.
I will approve it.
Until then, be the assistant coach of our running team.
Yes, sir.
Well done, my boy.
The nation is proud of you.
Thank you, sir.
In broad daylight, midst of raining bullets,
midst of raining bullets, and without a care for his own life…
Naik Laal Singh Chaddha saved five lives.
The Indian Army salutes this bravery.
Naik Laal Singh Chaddha.
That's my son.
Your grandpa would've been very proud today.
What do you plan to do now, Laal?
I'll go to Aunt Manjeet's house from here.
From tomorrow, back to duty.
Beyond that, I don't know.
Laal, ask them to discharge you from the Army.
Come home.
Okay.
Good.
Call me when you get back to camp.
Bless you.
Bye.
Take care.
Rupa!
Rupa!
Rupa!
Where are you going, sir?
Sir!
Rupa!
Rupa!
Rupa!
Rupa!
-Is everyone here? -Yes. They're waiting for you.
-Oh, no! -Laal?
-Laal! -Hey!
Hey!
Hey, stop it!
Laal!
Laal!
Laal!
Laal!
Boss, he's from the Army. It could get messy.
-Who's he? -My childhood friend.
He's crazy. He doesn't know who you are.
-Let him go. -He shouldn't have hit you.
Keep quiet. You don't know anything. Let's go.
He shouldn't have hit you.
Shut up, Laal!
Let him go, love, forgive him.
You're lucky… I respect the Army.
Come, love. Let's go.
-Sir, what happened? Are you okay? -Not now.
You've come to your aunt's after so long,
and you haven't said a word. Is everything okay?
Hello.
Rupa! It's been so long!
Yes, Laal's right here.
Talk to him.
Hello.
Laal…
he's gone out with friends. He will be back in the morning.
Can you meet me at India Gate?
Yes. Okay.
Do you know how dangerous he is? You shouldn't have hit him.
He shouldn't have hit you, Rupa.
He looks after me well.
I'm going to be the heroine in his next film.
It's just that he has anger issues.
I would never treat you like that.
I know, Laal.
I wanted to be your boyfriend.
Looking good… in uniform.
Handsome.
With you, after so many years, back in Delhi…
it feels nice.
It does.
We walked all night.
Rupa and I.
We were talking all night.
She told me that she worked in top-notch films.
Traveled the world.
Met many famous people.
Everyone respected her a lot.
She said that she was very happy.
She was enjoying life.
She was living a first-class life.
A night like this may never come again
One that brings us together
A night like this may never come again
One that brings us together
I want to gaze at you
From up close, all night
Don't want to let you go, not this time
I want you to stay
Are you really here with me?
Or is this a dream?
I don't trust my eyes
Why don't you tell me?
Once again, I yearn to tell you
How I feel about you
A night like this may never come again
One that brings us together
I should go now.
We're leaving for Dubai today.
You shouldn't go to Dubai.
-Then where should I go? -Come home.
Why are you so good to me, Laal?
Because you're my Rupa.
I will always be your Rupa.
Don't want to let you go
Not this time
I want you to stay
Then, once again, Rupa walked out of my life.
And I went back to the Army.
In the Army, I traveled the world for a year with the running team.
You were given a medal by your government!
For saving me?!
Mohammad Paaji!
A dimwit like you was awarded by your government.
Yes.
And now you travel abroad on government funds?!
Yes.
What a fine government!
How are you, Mohammad Paaji?
Still very much a cripple.
I spotted my savior…
and thought I should curse him to his face…
with my choicest abuses.
Mohammad Paaji lived in a small room.
Someone sponsored a phone booth at the airport for him to operate.
He found it inappropriate to hurl abuses at me in public,
so he took me to his house.
Paaji, is this where you live? In Mumbai?
Well, I tried desperately to go back home. I really did.
They disowned the dead.
How would they accept a living man?
Why?
I was no longer of use to them.
Listen to me carefully.
God has prepared such a heaven for you…
where there are 72 heavenly companions for each and every man.
Heavenly companions with skin so sheer
that you can see right through to the marrow of their bones.
There's God's word, and then those who interpret it.
And fools like us forget God and get swayed.
Did you know who I was…
when you saved me?
Tell me. Did you know who I was?
No.
I was the enemy, you fool!
I was there to kill you…
and to be martyred in glory.
See my cursed luck!
My own enemy carried me to safety…
trying to save my legless torso.
Buy me a drink, Mr. Laal.
Isn't it a good plan?
Bala said I'd handle manufacturing and he'd handle marketing.
But he isn't here anymore.
So, now, I'll do both.
You… will start a business?!
Of undergarments? Manufacturing and marketing?
Yes. I had promised Bala in Kargil.
We're partners, you see.
Meet him. Laal Singh Chaddha.
Naik Laal Singh Chaddha.
Millionaire Laal Singh Chaddha.
Businessman Laal Singh Chaddha…
whose marketing manager died even before the business started.
Good Lord!
Laal, if you become a manufacturer, I'll become your marketing manager.
That's great.
Fool! The day you become a businessman, I'll play football.
Friends, the new year comes with new hope.
A chance for a new beginning.
-Let's welcome… -A chance for a new beginning, my foot!
Everyone, with me,
-in ten, nine, eight, seven, -…nine, eight, seven,
-six, five, four, -six, five, four,
-three, two, -In all that noise,
-one… -I suddenly thought of Rupa.
I started thinking… how must she be celebrating New Year's Eve.
Rupa.
You shouldn't go to Dubai.
Then where should I go?
Come home.
Why are you so good to me, Laal?
Because you're my Rupa.
Lost in your thoughts, Laal?
Happy new year!
Happy new year, Mohammad Paaji.
After getting discharged from the Army, I went back home.
Mom was very happy.
Laal.
So was I.
Laal.
My son!
A short while later, I felt like I should visit Bala's family.
So, I made a trip to Bodipalem.
Bala's village.
I met his wife.
His tattaya passed away.
Tattaya?
Grandfather.
Oh, his mother's father?
Yes.
And I don't know anything about tailoring.
See this, Mom.
It's lovely.
The villagers had made a memorial to Bala.
I went to pay my respects.
Look, Bala, your book.
It's safe with me.
I haven't forgotten my promise.
I have the initial investment
of 100,000…
and I've spoken to Mom for the rest.
Don't you worry, my brother!
And guess where our factory is being set up!
In Rupa's old room.
I wrote to Rupa and Mohammad Paaji that I was starting the business.
I bought three machines, fabric,
and I hired two tailors.
I stitched 20 sets a day, and they stitched ten each.
That's 40 sets every day.
We made 1000 sets in a month.
Exactly as Bala had planned.
Bala was really smart.
Everything was working out exactly as he had planned.
We enjoyed making undergarments, so we just kept on making them.
However, what he had written on the last page wasn't happening.
We weren't able to sell 800 sets a month.
Son, I know to farm. But I have no idea about the undergarments business.
And then, one day, guess who turned up!
Thank you.
Mohammad Paaji!
What brings you here?
I thought I'd work on a sewing machine.
But Paaji, you don't have legs.
I know, you fool.
You wrote to me.
Bala Undergarments, right?
Very good.
-You've actually become a businessman. -Yes!
So, I'm here to be your marketing manager.
I'm a man of my word, Laal.
Where's the stock?
Not a single set has sold?!
We have sold five sets. Mom bought them. For me.
Mohammad Paaji gave me an idea.
We started a "Buy one, get one free" offer.
We still didn't sell anything.
So, he suggested a "Buy one, get two free" offer.
We still didn't sell anything,
so we tried "Buy one, get three free."
When we still didn't sell anything, we stopped production.
Oh my God!
Give me a pen.
Give me a pen.
Woman!
Our product needs a woman's name!
How can we do that?
It's a man's product.
What do men want, Laal?
Women! Write!
Write a woman's name!
Write it, Laal!
Sorry, Bala, my brother.
I knew only one woman's name.
The sweetest name in the world.
Rupa.
Game on, Laal! Now watch!
And then… a miracle happened.
Our product actually started selling.
Rupa Undergarments.
And just like that, we grew from three machines to nine machines.
Then we moved to a bigger place.
After that to an even bigger place.
Today, we have many factories,
and our head office is in Delhi.
Smile, please.
Our product is very popular.
Maybe you are wearing it too.
Yes. Hold on a minute.
Are you saying that you are the owner of Rupa Corporation?
Yes.
Very good.
Madam, we're in the company of a millionaire.
In a second-class, non-AC compartment.
Rupa Corporation!
Liar!
What an engaging story, son.
And you tell it so nicely.
Thank you.
Would you like to see a photo of Mohammad Paaji?
Sure.
-Here. -Let me see it.
-India Today featured us on their cover. -Wow.
Wow!
Show me.
We won an award a few years ago. Entrepreneur of the Year.
Isn't Mohammad Paaji looking smart in a suit?
Rupa Corporation!
Yes, Rupa Corporation.
I split the profits of Rupa Corporation into two halves.
Mohammad Paaji calls me a fool,
but every year, one-half of the profit goes to Bala's wife.
-Chithra! -Chithra!
-Is that in lakhs? -No, in crores.
Mohammad Paaji invested my profits in some cowshed.
He says I never have to worry about money again.
Mohammad Paaji is a very good man.
After Mom, Bala, and Rupa, he is my closest friend.
Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists
have held the city hostage with gunfire and bombings for 60 hours.
They have killed more than 175 civilians
and critically injured over 300.
Ismail Khan was killed by the police, but Ajmal Kasab was captured alive.
According to sources, Kasab is only 21 years old.
Laal.
I never thanked you…
for saving me.
Thank you, Laal.
Welcome, Paaji.
Laal.
I've never seen you pray.
No rituals, no offering prayers.
How come?
My Mom says that…
religion sometimes causes malaria.
And God resides within each of us.
Within Mom, within me, within you.
Mohammad Paaji, aren't you going home?
I was thinking the same, Laal.
It's time I went home.
I was told the enemy lives here.
Non-believers.
Then I found you.
I tried to kill you.
And you tried to save me.
I believed this to be an enemy country.
Instead, I found a friend.
You know, Laal…
I was suffering from malaria myself.
You saved me.
But malaria is still being spread there.
Many like me are being brainwashed.
Being taught to hate.
Laal…
I want to go back and start a school.
I want to teach children about friends like you here.
Paaji, I'll write letters to you.
Thank you, Laal.
Thank you.
And then, one day, Mohammad Paaji left.
But before leaving, he hired a lot of smart people
But before leaving, he hired a lot of smart people to look after Rupa Corporation.
Good morning, sir.
Along with Bala and Rupa, I now started missing Mohammad Paaji too.
-Hello. -Sir, it's Bahadur. I'm calling from home.
Mom is really unwell. Please come quickly.
Laal.
Come, sit.
Laal.
What happened, Mom?
Nothing, son.
It's just time for me to go.
Why are you going?
Because my time here is over, Laal.
There's no need to worry.
Everyone has to leave someday.
This is completely natural.
Death is also a part of life.
I was lucky to have you in my life.
But this is where we are meant to part ways.
I did my best.
I got some things right. Maybe I even got some things wrong.
Please don't go.
Don't go, Mom.
I wish.
Life is like golgappas, Laal.
Your tummy may be full… but your heart always craves more.
Look after yourself, okay?
Mom had cancer.
She died on a Thursday.
Mom used to say…
"The Lord wants you to keep only what you need
and give the rest to those in need."
So, I built a hospital in Mom's name.
Our family doctor takes care of it.
There, everyone is treated free of cost.
After my mom's death, there was no one to take care of the farm.
If I had gone back to the factory,
what would have become of the farm workers?
So, I didn't go back. I started farming.
During the day, work would keep me busy.
But as night would fall, memories of Rupa would torment me.
It had been many years since I had seen Rupa.
I missed her terribly.
Rupa!
And then, one day, she came back.
Just like that!
I cleaned up Mom's room for her.
I think she was very tired.
For the first few days, all she did was sleep…
all day, all night.
I told her everything.
Bala, Mohammad Paaji, the factory, and Rupa Corporation.
I told her that she need not worry about money anymore.
I could give her all she wanted.
But she didn't seem to care about money anymore.
She remained quiet most of the time.
Except once, when our home help was drunk
and was beating his wife… she got angry.
She beat him and then started crying herself.
For very long.
Rupa, that's enough. Stop it.
Enough.
It's okay, Rupa.
And then, one day, Rupa smiled.
We used to work together in the fields.
We were together all the time.
Just like carrots and peas.
I had got back my magician…
who could pluck out a plane from the sky and stuff it in her pocket.
She taught me to dance.
It felt like the two of us were a family.
She was the mother, and I was the father.
I have never felt such joy in my life.
That year, on Diwali, she gave me the best gift.
Shoes.
And that night…
Rupa…
will you marry me?
I'll take very good care of you.
I know, Laal.
But you won't marry me.
Because I'm not smart.
I'm stupid. Isn't that it?
No, Laal. It's not that.
I can't marry you because--
Because I can't be relied upon.
I may not be smart,
but I… I know what love is.
Laal.
Laal…
I love you…
very much.
That's the truth.
I'm here. Don't wake him.
Let's go.
Here one moment
Gone the next
You've been mine
Only in fragments
My life's story
Has many chapters
You are a part Of every one of them
I started running.
I'm not sure why. I just felt like running.
I ran to the main road.
Then I thought I'd run to the market.
I reached the market and thought I'd run to the city.
After crossing the city, I thought, "Let me run some more."
I ran so far ahead… that I had covered half the state.
So, I thought I might as well run across all of it.
I didn't feel like stopping.
From that day onward, I kept running.
I kept running.
-Anna Hazare! We are with you! -Anna Hazare! We are with you!
-Anna Hazare! We are with you! -Anna Hazare! We are with you!
Here, at the Ram Leela Ground,
Anna Hazare has been on a hunger strike for the past 12 days,
pushing for the anti-corruption Jan Lokpal Bill,
with massive citizen support.
Hey! Who's this guy? Such an idiot!
Who was that? Why didn't you stop him? Fool!
-Hail Anna Hazare! -Hail Anna Hazare!
We've just heard that Anna Hazare has ended his hunger strike.
I reached the sea and turned around.
Then I reached another sea. Again, I turned around.
When I reached the mountains, I turned around.
I just kept running.
Welcome to Samaj Sanchar! First, let's hear today's breaking news!
The police have captured underworld don Abbas Haji in Malaysia.
Let me remind you that a few months ago,
Abbas Haji's girlfriend, Rupa D'Souza was arrested from a small village in Punjab.
Rupa D'Souza was arrested from a small village in Punjab.
With the information she provided, Abbas has been arrested today.
I thought a lot…
about Mom,
Bala, Mohammad Paaji…
but mostly… about Rupa.
You are the seeker
You are also the messiah
You are the circus
And also the ringmaster
You wander in vain
In shrines and temples
The one that you seek
Is within you
Why do you torment yourself?
Didn't the pain of separation scar you?
Walk alone, O crazy one, walk alone
Leave the streets of sadness behind Walk alone
Walk alone, O crazy one, walk alone
Leave the streets of sadness behind Walk alone
Walk alone
Walk alone
Walk alone
Walk alone Welcome to Samaj Sanchar! Let's hear today's breaking news!
The Mumbai High Court has given its verdict
on the Abbas Haji and Rupa D'Souza case.
Abbas Haji was arrested with the help of model Rupa D'Souza.
Abbas Haji gets a life sentence for five murders,
and considering her role as the approver,
Rupa D'Souza is sentenced to only six months.
Now, let's meet a strange man who's been running across the country.
Mr. Laal Singh, are you running for world peace?
Are you running for women's rights?
Are you running for the environment?
One day, some TV reporters started filming me.
Sir! It's you!
I saw you running on TV.
I told my wife, "This guy is special."
Sir, I told her that you know everything.
Sir, I want to run with you wherever you go.
So, this guy started running with me.
Then some more people joined me.
And then some more.
They said that I gave them hope.
Well, I don't know about that.
I was just running.
Take it for the truth
A true lover is the one
Who can set their beloved free
The lover who can seek blessings
-For the one who broke their heart -For the one who broke their heart
A single teardrop of such a lover
Would cause even a desert to bloom
Walk alone, O crazy one, walk alone
Leave the streets of sadness behind Walk alone
Your love is wild and carefree
Break free of your cage and fly
The horizon where earth and sky meet Beyond the fiery sunset
That is your destination, O traveler
Walk alone, O crazy one, walk alone
Mom used to say, "The past is best left behind."
Maybe that's why I was running.
I ran for four years, seven months, two weeks, and three days.
He's stopped.
Maybe he'll say something.
Quiet!
Mr. Laal Singh is going to speak.
Mr. Laal Singh, why have you stopped?
I'm tired.
I'm going back home.
As you just saw,
Mr. Laal Singh is tired.
He's going back home.
Stay tuned for stories like this…
What a crazy fellow!
He isn't crazy.
I started to look a bit like my grandpas.
It made me happy.
He is the one Lord The eternal truth
The creator and doer
Devoid of fear or enmity
Omnipresent
He's unborn, self-existent
Attained by the Guru's grace
Chant…
The primal truth The truth through the ages
The present truth O Nanak, forever true
You can't fathom Him, no matter how much You ponder over Him
You may focus on Him But you can't attain the perfect silence
All the material pleasures of the world
Will not satiate your hunger
However wise you may be
You take nothing with you in the end
How to attain the Truth?
How to rip apart this veil of delusion?
Nanak writes that only
His will can carry you through
Sir… when you were out, these letters came from Ms. Rupa.
She even called many times.
Look, these are Rupa's letters. She's called me to Chandigarh.
Wow!
-She saw me running on TV. -Very good.
Uncle, Chandigarh has arrived.
-Gosh! -Take this.
Please move.
-Bye. -Bye.
Good luck!
-Bless me. -God bless you.
-I'll take your leave. Bye. -Bye!
-Bye, Uncle. -Give my regards to Rupa!
Laal.
Hi!
Hello.
When did you start wearing a turban?
You're looking so good.
Come in.
I've got golgappas for you.
I ate a few on the way though. I was hungry.
That's okay.
And…
I got the spiced water separately.
Have a seat.
Isn't this from Delhi?
Yes.
I saw you running on TV.
Yes, I ran a lot.
Me too.
Laal… I feel like I've treated you badly.
Very badly.
But…
I treated myself even worse.
Everything was wrong.
But now, it's all right.
Mom.
You're up, son?
Come here.
Meet my best friend.
Say hello.
Hello, Uncle.
Hello.
Mom, can I watch cartoons?
Yes, go.
You've become a mother?!
Yes, I've become a mother.
What's his name?
Aman.
Aman Chaddha.
He's also a Chaddha?!
Yes, because his father is a Chaddha.
Laal Singh Chaddha.
His father's name is also Laal Singh Chaddha?!
Laal…
you are his father.
Laal, listen to me.
Relax, Laal.
You didn't do anything wrong, Laal.
Laal, look at me.
Look at me.
It's all good.
Okay?
Isn't he the cutest?
Yes, he is. Just adorable.
But is he smart, or… -is he like me-- -Laal…
He's very smart.
The brightest in his class.
Can I…
can I go to him?
Of course. Go.
Go.
Laal…
I'm sick.
What happened?
I don't know.
The doctors haven't diagnosed it yet.
Come home with me. I'll take care of you.
Laal…
will you marry me?
I am colored now, forever
In the color of your love
In our union Two souls
Two souls Have become one
I found God
When I found you
By my side
Even though you weren't by my side
You were with me every moment
To be with you
I would wait an eternity
Even though you weren't by my side
You were with me every moment
To be with you
I would wait an eternity
All that I have
I surrender to you
Every atom of my being
Is yours
All that I have
I surrender to you
Every atom of my being
Is yours
I am colored now, forever
In the color of your love
In our union
Two souls
Have become one
I found God
When I found you
By my side
Laal, were you scared when you were in Kargil?
Yes.
But at night, when the Himalayas would glow,
I would feel really nice.
And in Kanyakumari, when I saw the sunset…
it looked like a million stars were twinkling in the ocean.
When I was running in Ladakh,
it felt like there were two skies.
And in the twilight of the desert…
as I was counting the stars…
I forgot who I was, and what I was doing there.
It was so serene and peaceful.
I wish I had been there with you then.
You were there… with me.
I love you, Laal.
Today's your death anniversary.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Aman's also fine.
He's such a good kid.
He does all his work on his own.
He's going to start school from tomorrow.
Our old school.
I'm teaching him to play table tennis.
And to sew.
If you were here, you'd have taught him to catch airplanes.
He reads me stories.
He's very smart.
He's written you a letter.
I'm not allowed to read it.
You read it…
later.
He misses you a lot.
I do too.
Mom used to say, "Each of us has our own destiny."
Mohammad Paaji too says… that everything is predestined.
I don't know… where all this is written,
who wrote it,
or why it is written in the first place.
Whatever happens, is it in our control?
Or are we just drifting in the wind…
blown from here to there?
I have no idea.
Perhaps a bit of both.
Had you been here, you would've explained it to me.
I…
I miss you, Rupa.
I really miss you.
Son, you have to work very hard.
You have to do better than your best.
Yes, Dad.
-Shall I go? -Yes, Dad.
-Sure? -Yes, Dad.
Okay, I'll come to get you in the evening.
-Bye-bye, Dad. -Bye.
-Aman. -Yes, Dad?
-I love you, my son. -I love you, Dad.
Off you go.
Do the lines on your palm Determine your fate?
Or do you mold your destiny With your own hands?
-I can't do it. -You can do it. You can do it.
Trust in your primal instincts. Breathe through the pain.
You breathe through the bloody pain, Barry.
You're doing brilliantly. Just keep going.
Get that phone out of my face.
You want this, trust me.
-Kaj? -Yes?
-How's it going? -Good. Coming.
A peanut butter jar?
It's the same jar I used with Didi and Teun.
-Two shots, two winners. -Okay, well let's try for a hat trick.
-Yeah. Do you think we could talk first? -What, now?
I just thought it would be nice if Didi and Teun could stay over some time.
I don't think that's a good idea.
You can barely look after yourself, let alone a child.
We can discuss it another time, okay? Not now.
-Sure. -Great. Thanks.
Hey, Roos. Good luck.
Can I have some peanut butter?
Uh…
Have you chosen a name yet for your little man?
Fred. After my father.
Fred? You want to call him Fred?
Imagine what it'll be like for him at school. "Hey, Freddy." Yalla, seriously.
-Definitely not. -Well, I quite liked it.
-Mohammed. -Mohammed?
Babe, it's the world's most common name.
-Yeah, so? -So?!
-Samih. -Samih.
Samih Fred Ouazzani. Welcome to the world. Congratulations.
-He's having my surname though. De Jong. -Your surname?
Hello! Hey there, little one.
You're going to have the best mom and dad in the whole world. I promise.
-What's her Apgar-score? -Your baby is perfectly healthy.
-She scored a seven. -We don't need to worry about that then.
-Seven? -That's good, right?
Could you do it again?
THE WONDER WEEKS
Oh, aren't you a lovely sturdy girl?
I guess you can't sit up either, with all those extra kilos.
Let's turn you around. Little fatty.
-Did she just say "fatty"? -There we go.
Hey, sweetie.
Your daughter is at the upper limits of the growth chart.
The growth curve grows exponentially. It can have lasting consequences
for her motor skills, physical and social-emotional development.
Excuse me?
Your baby is too fat. Code yellow.
-Huh? -That's impossible.
We follow the feeding and sleep schedules religiously.
I give her vitamin D drops, there are visual stimulation cards above her bed…
Mommy shouldn't worry so much. Mommy's a bit neurotic, isn't she?
Are you surprised?!
Is she rolling over yet?
-Uh… no. -No.
Oh, God. There's something wrong with our child. She can't even roll over.
You both work, right?
Yes. Anne's recently gone back to work.
-And I occasionally work from home. -That's what I thought.
Luckily she's going to day care, which will help her social and emotional development.
Well… We still have a slight issue there. Um, well…
See, all the nurseries in our area are full
because everyone had babies during the pandemic.
You need to spend more time her.
We can hardly leave her in her crib all day
just looking at those visually stimulating cards of yours now, can we?
Hm? Do something different with her. Baby yoga, baby swimming, it all helps…
Right, Mia has a bottle at 11 and she has a nap from 12 to 2.30.
Oh, and please make sure she's in her sleeping bag.
And if she cries, that means she's experiencing a developmental leap.
And if you forget, just look at the development calendar…
We've been through this ten times.
It's not exactly rocket science.
Remember the lists. And the bottle should be no hotter than 30 degrees.
-Check it on your wrists. It's important. -Babe, I've got this. Seriously.
-It'll be fine. -Good luck.
Was this all the milk?
Barry.
Sorry, but this was not part of the agreement.
You can't suddenly want to play Dad with the third child.
-You're the donor. That's it. -I know.
Why now? You were never interested in our children before.
It's hard for me to see I'm not a part of their lives.
Come on.
-What? -No.
They're our children. Our children.
Look, Kim. Nothing's going to change for you guys.
I can change.
I can take more responsibility, I can be part of the family, help you…
Maybe it's not such a crazy idea for them to have a father figure in their lives.
This is what you get when the donor is your best friend.
Is Kaj my dad?
Um… Yes, sweetie, he is.
Surprise.
Anne, something big's come in. Woah!
Uh, do you read the tabloids?
-No. -Really?
Here. A celebrity breakup. It's good for the firm.
I was thinking of giving it to Floris.
Floris? Why? But I always handle all the divorce cases.
NINA ZOMERS GETTING DIVORCED
Is it not too much for you now that you're a mother?
-No. I'll just pick up where I left off. -Great.
-Could you do something for me, Dirk-Jan? -Of course.
-Clear off. -Oh, yeah, yeah. No, of course.
Right. Sorry. Good luck with um…
Hey! Could you do something for me?
-Sorry. No time. -Wait, wait, wait.
-Have you got time now? -Well, petrol prices have gone up a lot.
-You're a bike courier. -Yeah.
Here. Can you deliver this to my house? It's Koningslaan 60.
-Sixty. -Got it? Okay.
Oh, tell my husband to check the temperature of the milk on his wrist.
Right.
You were meant to hand it in last week.
Could you watch her for a minute? I'll be right back.
Barry, wait.
Hi Mia. Coochy coo.
Hi. Thanks for getting here so quickly.
Your wife said you need to check the temperature on your wrist.
Unbelievable. Thanks.
She also said I'd get a tip.
No, of course, right.
She said 20.
-Twenty? -Yeah.
Petrol prices.
Oh, right.
Ramon…
I think I'm going to need some more time.
Don't you like it anymore? What's the matter?
Hello. How's my little cutie doing? My, haven't you grown, my dear.
When are you two getting married?
You've got a baby now. You're done playing around.
Would you like some tea?
What's in the suitcase?
I'm staying over. I've come to help you with the baby.
Oh. You never told me.
That way the little one can get to know his grandma.
Right. That'll be nice.
Look. Samih's already crawling. So nice to see.
Wow, Mia can't even sit up yet, can you, sweetie?
Teun was the same at his age. It helps them sleep through the night too.
-Which day care does Mia go to? -She's still on the waiting list.
They've not called me up yet. I don't know.
How long did you guys have to wait?
I never did. I've got Kim. She sorts everything out.
-Hi. -Hi.
I signed my child up here a few months ago and I've still not heard anything.
-The waiting list is completely full. -How long is that waiting list exactly?
About 12 months.
Right. Thanks?
Hi, I'm a member of Moms for Moms and I'd like to enroll my child.
Okay. We've got a place available.
Perhaps you'd like to have a look around, and I'll come and find you.
I thought you said you were full.
Yes, but we reserve a certain number of places for members of Moms for Moms.
Moms for Moms? What's that? Some kind of elite club?
Felix.
That's the starting line. And that's the brake. Very important, okay?
You put one foot on the front, one on the back, and push up and down.
-But, I'm scared. -I'll hold on to you, sweetie.
And you'll pick it up soon.
Alright? Come on, high five. Come on!
I've got you. Good. And a bit faster…
-You're like a rocket. Faster? -Well done, Didi.
Not on the grass!
Look, Daddy's fallen over too.
It's alright. It's alright. She's okay. She's okay.
On your feet. That's okay. Head's alright.
The kids are crazy about him.
I'll push. Well done.
Right, I've set up a co-parenting plan, so that everything's legally correct.
Are there any agreements I need to know about?
No, but we've known each other such a long time…
Honey, we don't even know if Kaj can handle fatherhood.
-Kaj is the biological father, right? -Yes.
How about having a trial period?
A temporary transitional phase. That way we can see how it goes
and how it feels, and then take it from there.
What do you think?
Well, maybe that's not such a bad idea. Right, babe?
I can live with that for now.
If anything happens, I will pull the plug.
You shouldn't worry so much, Kim.
Great. All I need from you, Kaj, is a certificate of conduct.
Do all parents need that?
No, but that wouldn't be a bad idea.
Oh, I need to express milk. Excuse me.
-Hey. -Hey.
Did you manage to sort out the day care?
No. Their waiting list is over a year long.
Except members of some dumb little club, Moms for Moms, can enroll.
I'm the founder of Moms for Moms.
Right. That's good.
Maybe you should pay that dumb little club a visit?
-Yes. I mean… Yes, I'll do that. -Bye.
-Darling, Mia's awake again. -Yeah.
You can go check on her, too.
I would love to, but I don't have any breasts.
Right. The milk factory will see to it.
Come on, come on. Just latch on, latch on.
I can't do it anymore.
I've got inverted nipples, they're all cracked.
My boobs feel like watermelons.
-Honey, why don't you just stop? -Ow.
Shall I just make a bottle?
-Hi. -Yo.
Done?
There you go. Nice one.
What's it for?
It's for my children.
-You should try it some time. -Rather you than me.
I don't think he's at home.
That's a promising start.
Hey! You're early.
Kaj, I said five o'clock.
Is it five already?
Didi's so excited.
All she can talk about lately is that she's going to stay with Daddy.
Come on up. I'll open the door.
-Yoo-hoo. -Hey.
-Hey. -Daddy!
Woah, yes. You're saying "Daddy" because you know I'm your daddy.
-Hey. -Hello.
I'm so happy to see you.
Are you collecting beer cans? Nice collection.
I had a party last night.
And it didn't occur to you to tidy up a bit before the kids arrived?
I didn't have time. Sorry, Kim.
-Where are the kids going to sleep? -Here, on the couch, nice and cozy.
-You are joking. -Chill.
I've ordered a kids bed from the thrift shop.
-I'm sure Didi will love that, right?. -Right?
-Alright. We're off. -You're off? Okay.
You're so heavy. Daddy's going to do a workout with you.
-Come to Daddy. -Bye, sweetheart.
-See you soon. -I… I…
Just put it on the floor.
-Yes, okay. See you. -Bye.
-Bye. -Say, "Bye, Mommies".
Bye. We'll be fine.
Roll over. Go on. Go on. There.
What are you doing?
I don't want her to be behind.
You think this is going to work?
Look. Have a good look what it says.
"Don't get too hung up on the development of motor skills."
Think of other things that will be more useful to her later.
That's all well and good. But I still want her to learn to roll over.
Mia. Mia. Come on. Let's roll over.
No? Don't be a jerk.
-Join in. Come on. Look. -Okay.
-Three, two, one. -Go on.
Nothing. The other way. The other way. Good.
Man, you're lucky he takes after Ilse.
Sabri, what are all these people doing here?
Didn't I say my family wanted to meet the little one?
When you said relatives, I didn't think it would be your entire family.
Darling, this isn't even ten percent.
We've brought you this beautiful djellaba from Marrakesh.
There you go. Put your head through.
Smile, and maybe do a bit of this as well.
Honestly, babe, it really suits you.
-Hi. -Hi.
Oh, honey, you're still in your pajamas. Should we come back later?
No, it's not my pajamas. It's a kind of Moroccan poncho.
Nice.
-What are you doing here? -Sabri said you weren't feeling too great.
Right. Well, come in.
-Hey, I brought something. -Hi, sweetie.
-Samih Ouazzani. -No, he's got my surname.
-When's the circumcision? -What?
When is Samih's circumcision?
Well, soon.
If god wills it.
Circumcision?
It's fine. It's like having your tonsils removed.
Okay. We'll throw in a little bit of this and some of this magic potion.
Glug, glug, glug, glug, glug.
Whipped cream for a yummy flavor.
Cover your ears.
Ready, Teun?
-Not bad. Okay, pal. There. -We.
-But… He likes it. -He smells.
Again? Jesus. Where does it all come from, little one?
It's alright. Daddy will be quick.
It's okay. What a brave boy. Oh! Oh, shit.
-You said "shit". -Did I say "shit"? Is it not allowed?
-No. -Sorry.
Okay. A diaper. A diaper. We have no diapers.
-What's this? -A tea towel.
Look, in the old days, people used a tea towel…
Yes, yes, Daddy will be quick. Which was reusable.
Okay, this goes like that.
-Hi, sweetie. -I'm so glad you came.
-Thanks for the invitation. -Of course.
-Here you go. -Thank you.
-Hi, congratulations. -Thank you.
-Welcome to Moms for Moms. -Yeah, wow.
Goodness. Really impressive.
-Hi, congratulations. -Thank you.
-Does this whole estate belong to you? -It belongs to Moms for Moms.
I've never seen so many friendly moms together in one place before.
It's amazing. And it's all thanks to Kim.
-Anne, I'm glad you came. -Thank you.
Always good to have a lawyer in our midst. Let me give you the tour.
-See you later. -See you later.
-Nice spot, isn't it? -You can say that again.
Moms for Moms provides access to the best schools,
best swimming lessons, babysitters, day cares.
We have our own website with tips,
we organize parties, baby showers, gender reveals like this one.
The moms are always there for each other, but we do expect loyalty.
-Of course I'll make time for it. -Great, so what do you think?
-It's… It's fantastic. -Welcome to the dumb little club.
Hey, little T. Let's go party.
-Hi. -Hi.
-What's that? -We ran out of diapers. It's no big deal.
Good boy.
-I'm glad you came. -Did I have a choice?
-No. -It's my first gender reveal party.
It's not the kind of party Daddy normally goes to.
Today, we're announcing what it is.
-Yeah. I can't wait. -It's a girl.
What? Really?
-You're getting a sister. -Don't tell anyone.
-Very nice. -Look, there's mommy.
-Mommy. -Hello, sweetie.
-Good to see you again. -Hi, Kim.
Hi, little one. What's that?
A tea towel. I had to get creative. We ran out of diapers.
We've got some diapers inside.
-Wow, it really suits you. -Yeah?
-Look at Super Dad over here! -With the wings.
Look what I've got. I got my certificate of conduct today.
That's great. That means I can get it all sorted. It's almost official.
Hey, it's a girl.
-Kaj! -What?
Thanks a lot.
-What, she didn't know? -No.
Yeah, but…
Come on, kids. Let's drink some beer. Didi, let's go, there's cake.
-I told you he's an idiot. -He's a bit tactless, isn't he?
Surprise.
-Okay. Three, two, one. -Three, two, one.
-It's your turn. -No. No, I did it last night.
And I did it the day before and the day before that, for months on end.
I love you.
I've already fed her, you only need to check on her.
I love you very much.
Yeah, sure.
Mia, you're going through one of those annoying leaps, aren't you?
There you go, next to lion. Lion is going to sleep next to you.
Lion is also going to sleep. With his eyes closed.
He's closing his eyes and he's lying down next to you.
"Rice dishes. In a city of countless cuisines, four culinary writers take…"
Want to play with the cow? Cow is also going to sleep.
Moo says the cow. Moo says the cow. Cow is also going to sleep.
-Hey, hey. -It's about time you went to sleep now.
How much longer is this going to take?
Dearest moms. We are will do our very best to ensure the health of our babies.
A lot of babies and children are too fat nowadays.
That's why we're organizing a Stay Healthy day
for schools and the community.
And I still need some volunteers. I need someone for the animation team.
Anne, are you any good at dancing?
-Well… -Perfect. I'll put you on the list.
You know what, I'm going to pass the list around, so you can sign up.
We're all going to prepare healthy snacks. Moms for Moms.
Hey, what's the matter? You look like you've come straight from the trenches.
Yes. The nights are bit short.
That's not nice. Is Mia not sleeping through the night?
No. I really don't know what to do. She cries all the time, for no reason.
I've got some good news. You're on the shortlist for the day care.
And in the meantime, we've organized a babysitter for you.
That's amazing.
That will make your life a whole lot easier.
-Hester is really great. -You sorted that out quickly.
And baby swimming lessons have also been arranged.
I pushed it through a bit, because your baby really is a little bit too heavy.
Mom. Don't put him to sleep yet. He still needs to be fed.
Are you going to teach Samih Moroccan?
Yes. I want him to be able to communicate with his cousins.
It'll be really cool for him to speak two languages.
-Why doesn't she breastfeed her son? -Ilse's stopped breastfeeding.
It's too hard for her.
If she was Moroccan, you wouldn't have had this issue.
-What did she say? -Nothing.
She thinks I'm terrible, doesn't she?
It's just that he's her first grandchild, and she wants what's best for him.
Like a circumcision. Isn't that incredibly painful?
No. I was the same age as Samih and it never bothered me.
I can't even remember it.
He's born into two cultures. Please can we pass that down to him?
Yes. I agree. You're right. I just don't know how to tell my parents.
We could tell them together. It'll be fine, honey. I promise.
His little willy.
It's not that bad. In the USA, this happens all the time.
How do you know?
When was the last time you saw a willy? Twenty years ago?
Come on, Kaj.
Is there something you're not telling us?
-Would you do it to Teun? -No.
-Hi. Come in. -Thank you.
Okay. Here are the schedules.
The milk is in the fridge. I've labelled everything.
Give Mia her bottle at 11 o'clock. She has a nap between 12 and 2.30.
Not too long, but definitely not short.
At three o'clock give her another bottle. A little less. It's all written down.
It's essential that you stick to the schedules and don't miss anything out.
And make sure not to give her more food than what it says here.
Okay. I'll go and play with her first so she can release some energy.
Great. And if you have any other questions,
you can always text or call me.
I'd really appreciate it
if you could send me a photo or a video from time to time.
-Of course. -Hey, cookie. Hello.
-Hi. I'm Barry. -Hester.
-Welcome. We're glad you're here. -Thanks.
Here's Mia, our little air raid siren.
Hi.
How did you do that?
Baby's are highly sensitive. They pick up on everything.
-So, if you're relaxed, they will be too. -That's good to know.
Women who have children later in life are often very stressed.
Later in life?
-I'm only 32. -Sorry, I thought you were older.
Right, shall we get going?
Yes.
Compensation? What for?
I've always supported you so you could grow.
You have me to thank for your success.
I am successful is thanks to the fact that I've worked extremely hard.
Who came up with the name? Me, right?
The name is everything.
You mean to say the name is worth 60 million?
-And I built the website. -The website was useless, remember?
It was full of bugs, and when you ordered something, it ended up in China.
Those were teething problems.
Teething problems which I needed to hire a professional to sort out.
Literally everything you touch turns to shit.
I'm not the one who jumped into bed with the tennis instructor, Nina.
That was you.
Okay. I think we should leave it there for now.
I will discuss everything with my client,
and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you for coming.
Thank you.
Barry. Barry! Could you check on Mia?
No, I'm on the phone.
I don't even have time to wipe my own butt.
Yeah. I'm going, I'm going.
-What is he doing? -Trust me. It's all good.
Is he alright?
He's tapping into Mia's energy pathways.
He's dialing in. Like you did with the Internet in the old days.
You are out of touch with yourself.
You're being sucked dry, I can tell.
Negative energies. You're passing them on to Mia.
You can't enjoy life this way.
Sorry, but with all due respect for my energy pathways
and mister shanti shanti here, I don't think this for me. Sorry.
Anne, do you want your baby to sleep, or would you prefer more sleepless nights?
Of course I want Mia to sleep through, but I think this is traumatizing her.
Just give it chance. We're here now.
Give it a chance. Just let him do his thing, okay?
-Sorry, but this is ridiculous. -Oh?
She's asleep. She's asleep.
You're a genius. Thank you.
-She's adorable. -Look at you.
Yeah. Look, look, look, look.
Mia.
-Voilà. -What's this?
-For you. -No way.
-Thank you. -All yours. Try it out?
Thank you.
That's so annoying.
Have you looked into the de Vries-de Jong case yet?
Certainly. I've already filed the case.
The counter party made a procedural error, so we're guaranteed to win it.
-Do you still want to become partner? -Of course I do.
Even now that you're a mother?
Yes. Don't write me off just because I'm a mother.
Hans is retiring soon, so there'll be a spot available.
I will put your name forward with the other partners.
Thanks for your confidence.
I'll be honest, I had my doubts when you first came back to work,
but you're back to being the old Anne again.

-Hi, Dirk. -Where are you?
We're about to have the strategy meeting for the Nina Zomers case.
What? I rescheduled for tomorrow. I sent out an e-mail to everyone.
Well, it clearly hasn't been received, because she's here, waiting for you.
Could you take over, please? I'm at a really important meeting.
-Dressed like a giant strawberry? -A watermelon.
If I don't do this, my child won't get into day care.
Don't worry. I'll take over.
Great. Thank you. The file is on my desk.
All you need to do is read through the strategy.
I really need to get back. Thank you. Thanks again, Dirk.
Anne. Anne, can you give me a hand?
-Alright, hurry up. -Here you go.
Nice outfit.
Hey, um… Teun. Do you know what you did? You pressed the button
and you shouldn't have done that. Teun. Open the door, mate. Teun.
-Come on… -Hey, calm down.
I can go and get your spare key.
I don't have one. I lost it.
-Teun, seriously. -Call roadside assistance.
That's too obvious. Go inside, keep Kim busy. I'll sort this out.
-I don't think so. No, no way. -Kim is going to kill me if she sees this.
Okay. I'll give you ten minutes.
Ten Minutes. You're a hero.
Look at Daddy. Teun.
-Where did you disappear to? -I had an unexpected important meeting.
This is also important. You just do as you please.
And where is Kaj anyway?
Oh, he's still with Teun. He threw up, so he had to change him.
-Can I get you anything else? -Hey.
-Any luck? -No.
-You have to tell them. -I'm not telling Kim.
Then I'm calling roadside assistance.
Where is Teun?
Teun, listen to Daddy. Look at Daddy. Press it. Like that.
There's no point, guys.
-How long has he been locked in? -He's not.
What are you doing?
-Teun is locked in. -Maar…
What is wrong with you?
-Calm down, Kim. It was an accident. It… -An accident?
You can't leave a baby in a car on its own.
I called roadside assistance.
It'll be fine. They'll be here in an hour.
An hour? It's really hot and the windows are shut. He might suffocate.
-Stand back. -No, Kaj!
Oh no. Man oh man, are you alright, sweetie?
Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie. Are you okay?
-It's all alright. You're alright. -There, there, sweetie.
He quickly had to change him, seriously?
-Come on, sweetie. -Come on, lovely.
I'm sorry, Anne.
-Hi, sweetie. Yeah. -Hi, lovely.
-What time is Hester coming? -Oh, I gave her the day off.
How come? Why didn't you discuss it with me?
I wrote it on the calendar.
-So, what now? I have to work. -Me too.
I'm working on location, so I really can't take her.
Try calling my mom. Sorry, I really have to go.
-Anne. What's going on? -Sorry. I had no choice.
-Could you babysit her? -This isn't a day care center.
I've got an appointment with Nina Zomers.
-Don't make a habit of this. -I won't. You're a hero.
-Here's the diaper bag. -What a cute little guy.
-She's a girl. -What's her name again?
These are the divorce papers and the agreements
that you both need to sign. After that it's official.
I'm sorry. She vomited all over me. Take her for a bit, I can freshen up.
Hey, sweetie. Vomiting all over Dirk, that's not very practical.
-Right. Sorry. -That's okay.
-I'm sorry. -Is she yours?
-Yes, she's mine. -May I?
Yes. Go to Ruben. Careful you don't get any mess on you.
-What's her name? -Mia.
-Hi, Mia. aren't you gorgeous, Mia. -Suits you.
Thank you.
-You can have it all. -What?
Nina, hang on, can we talk about this in private?
No. That won't be necessary.
But… Nina.
I miss you. I've done some terrible things.
It's okay. I miss you too.
And I think you are missing your bottle. I think you want your bottle.
Everyone prepares for the pregnancy, but not what comes after it.
Giving birth is an attack on your body.
Recovering from it takes time, energy, love…
I want to break a taboo today.
When was the last time you had sex?
-Since I got pregnant, I'm unstoppable. -Don't think I hadn't noticed, babe.
Well, it's always been great for us.
Except, less often now that my mother-in-law has moved in.
Just feels a bit weird.
-How long is she staying? -No idea.
But every day is a day too long.
-What about you, Anne? -Huh?
How's it going for you?
Uh… Fine, yeah. We did it recently.
-On his birthday. -His birthday? That was three months ago.
Come on, Anne. You have to put in the work.
It's just different now with Mia.
I mean, we're barely sleeping and I'm really busy.
Is it really because of Mia? Or is there something else?
Well, I hardly feel like the sexiest woman on Earth.
I mean, I don't feel great about myself. And the stretch marks don't exactly help.
Oh, but that's nothing to be ashamed of.
Stretch marks are your tiger stripes, right, ladies?
The proud marks of motherhood.
-Right. Okay. -You have to learn to love yourself again.
I want to do some hip openers together
to bring you back in touch with your yoni.
Breathe in, and out towards your perineum.
Breathe in through your nose, and out through your vagina.
Your piggy bank of happiness.
Let your piggy bank glow.
Welcome.
Lovely. That's the big advantage of Moroccan in-laws.
-Always great food. -My mother made it extra big.
Especially for you. You can just use a fork and knife.
No, I'll do it the Moroccan way.
It's the tradition.
Sabri and I need to tell you something.
We're having a party and we'd like to invite you.
-Well, we'll be there. -Are you finally getting married?
Yes.
No.
We're having…
Samih is getting circumcised.
How nice.
It sounds more extreme than it is. It's just a small procedure.
What is the point of that, for God's sake?
-Dad, come on. -What?
Are you okay with that?
I also had to get used to the idea.
But Sabri did it as well.
And it never bothered him. And me neither.
It's more hygienic, right?
And it's also better for your sex life.
I never heard you complain.
But you did moan a lot.
-So, you are coming? -Yes.
Lovely.
Barry?
You need to come to the bedroom.
Is she already asleep?
As a baby.
Then maybe you should come to bed as well.
So that's why you're becoming a partner, because you have great ideas.
Partner? That sounds sexy.
It does.
Tell me what to do.
-Should we check on her? -No, no.
She'll be fine.
-Shit, the blanket fell off. -Put that thing away.
-I'll go check on her in a minute. -What if she gets cold?
I'm just going to check.
Sweetie…
Sweetie.
Close your eyes, shhh.
Oh fuck.
-Everything okay? -Yes, he's asleep.
-Why are you out so late? -He just kept crying.
I couldn't get him to calm down and Didi said he sleeps in the car.
-Where's Didi? -Still at home.
-By herself? -Kaj, you can't leave her alone.
-You know what can happen in five minutes? -The door is locked.
Are you coming or what?
Hey, sweetie.
-Are you okay? -Yes.
Let's put this away.
-Why isn't she in bed? -She didn't want to go to sleep yet.
Roos, this is ridiculous. We're going home and taking the kids.
Sorry, I made a mistake. I'm still learning.
Just give me another chance and when something goes wrong
I'll call you or take them home myself, really.
I think we'll just make things worse if we take them now.
Sweetie, Mommy is taking you to bed. Why don't you get your toothbrush?
-I'll get Teun. -Bye, sweetie.
Bye.
Kids need structure and you need to give them that.
-Going to bed on time is part of it. -Don't you ever make mistakes?
But yours are pretty bad.
Kim is furious and she has a right to be.
-Why did she come? I called you. -I don't want to lie to her.
I already kept quiet about your criminal record.
-It's taken care of. -Don't ask why.
Listen, if you want this to work, something needs to change.
The kids are counting on you.
And so am I.
-They went right to sleep. -Thank you.
Shall we go?
-Yes. -I'm sorry.
-Is your tummy okay? -I'm fine.
It's a code red.
Yeah, it's not going well.
Red? How can that be?
We follow all the schedules. We went to swimming for babies and some weird reiki.
-Reiki? -There was an issue with her chakras,
but they're working perfectly now.
We can't measure chakras here, but we can measure her weight.
You're clearly not following the schedules.
That's absurd.
Well, the numbers don't lie.
It's not your fault, right? No, it's not your fault.
No, you have no control over what they put in your mouth.
-No. -Hey, look at this. Look.
She's giving her the wrong food. It's not macrobiotic.
I think she's trying to poison her.
Don't you think you're exaggerating?
Huh? How is that possible?
It's not even labelled.
What a mess.
I don't think Hester is using the feeding schedules or checklists.
Does she even tick the boxes? You need to watch her.
Some people aren't used to a dictatorship.
I know what my child needs.
Sweetie, try to let it go, a little bit.
Yeah, so Mia can develop obesity, right?
We don't want that, right? No.
We don't want that, sweetie.
I'm really bothered by this.
Now I can start all over again. You know how long it took to label everything?
It's incomprehensible, she only has to follow the lists.
I did everything for her. The timing, the exact amounts.
Sabri.
You're still over there, man.
Why is there a sheep in the bathroom?
What?
I still need to wash it, it smells awful.
-I'll take it with me in a minute. -Why did you bring it?
For the party. I couldn't keep it with me. I needed to put it somewhere.
Not in my house.
What does a sheep have to do with the party?
It's an offering.
It's a blessing for Samih.
You're slaughtering that sheep?
No chicken, remember?
You always get me in trouble.
Sweetie, Mia is doing amazing.
She's like a fish in the water.
-Hey, Hester. -Hey.
What are you doing here?
I dropped off Mia and decided to join in. I felt like taking a swim.
Okay.
Nice bikini.
Yes, a bathing suit is more for moms.
But it looks amazing on you.
Are you joining us?
No, I want to keep my hair dry. I have a meeting later.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'll just watch you.
Look at all that snot. It's everywhere. On my shoulder.
Hello, Anne.
Hello.
-Did we have an appointment? -No.
I have good news for you.
We have an open spot at the day care center.
No way.
You really are a lifesaver.
-I wouldn't know what I'd do without you. -You can start next Monday.
I've moved heaven and earth to get Mia in that day care.
-I only do that for friends. -Thank you.
I'm forever grateful.
I could also use your help.
I'm not comfortable with the idea that Kaj is raising my kids.
Okay.
He's trying, but I understand your concerns.
I want you to go through his file again.
I can't just do that, Kim.
-That's confidential information. -Do you know he has a criminal record?
I don't think so. He had a certificate of conduct.
Well, I would take another look.
Thank you.
Enjoy your day.
-Hey, sweetie. -Hey, what's taking so long?
I'm still at the office, I needed to finish something.
You didn't forget, right? It's our night.
I'll leave soon.
Shall we begin?
-Yes. -Come on.
THE WONDER WEEKS
CERTIFICATE OF CONDUCT
Mommy.
Perfect.
-Come on. -Okay.
You're right. Kaj does have a criminal record!
Kim: OMG, I knew Kaj wasn't to be trusted. I feel sick my kids are with a criminal.
Is Anne still not home?
No. No.
I really went all out and now the food is getting cold.
Working late?
What are you doing?
I need to finish something for Nina Zomers.
In the dark, with a UV light?
She thought Ruben had falsified documents.
-Really? -Yes, and we need to be thorough.
-You can never be too sure nowadays. -And, did you find something?
-Unfortunately not. -Do you need my help?
I found two false documents with the Jansen audit the other day.
No, I'm okay.
Everything's correct.
I've already let her know.
-Will you lock up? -Yes.
Bye.
A few years ago, I travelled through Asia for a year, alone.
Well, I wasn't alone, I had my backpack.
-But I never felt that free before. -Really?
-I've always wanted to do that. -Then you definitely should do it.
It's an experience you'll never forget.
It sounds amazing.
-But, tell me… -Sorry I'm so late.
-Hey. -Hey, Hester.
-You're still here. -Yes.
Barry asked me to stay for dinner and he's an amazing cook.
It was delicious.
-Yes, he's good at that. -I put some leftovers in the oven.
I'm going to check on Mia first.
I've heard so many stories about Vietnam.
And then we go past the wild sea and the poisonous snake
all the way around, across the mountains.
-Until we reach… -The treasure.
The pirate's treasure.
Come on, hurry.
I'll chop you into little pieces and feed you to the fish.
Come, quickly. Other pirates. Stay low.
Hey T. Shhh.
Kaj?
-Kaj? -Yes?
Hey, Kim. Why are you here?
Child Services has decided
to withdraw the parental authority.
What?
There'll be an investigation to find out if you're able to take care of the kids.
-What kind of investigation? -I want my children to be safe.
Kim, they are safe here.
You concealed your criminal record.
-How do you know? -Does it matter?
Ten years ago, I scammed people online. It has nothing to do with kids.
I don't trust you with my children.
Sweetie, come with Mommy.
I'll chop you up in bits and feed you to the fish.
Stop playing.
I want to stay with daddy.
We're leaving.
Sweetie, Daddy would really love it if you stayed.
But now you need to listen to Mommy and go with your other mommy.
-And I'll see you soon. -Promise?
Of course, I'm your daddy.
Give me a hug.
Sweetie, let's go.
Let's go.
There, this is for you.
Leave the sword here.
Not suited for kids.
Look at that, you're already here.
Hi. Right.
I don't know how you did it, but Nina Zomers is very happy with us.
You should have seen her. A proper matchmaker. Right, Anne?
We've come to a decision and we have good news for you.
LAWYERS - MEDIATORS
You're going to be our new partner.
-No. -Yes.
Your hard work paid off and I put in a good word for you.
It's amazing Dirk, thank you.
Congratulations.
But I do need to discuss it at home first.
What?
-Haven't you done that already? -We just need to take care of some things.
It will have a huge impact on the home front.
This is a one-time offer and you have a week to decide.
Yes.
-Here, for the sheep. -No way.
I wasn't planning it, but now I need to pay you for the sheep.
Why would I want that?
Now you can finally pay alimony for your three kids.
You're family, this is my present.
-Thank you, man. -My pleasure.
Why is the sheep still here?
Is it that time already? I need to leave. Good luck, man.
I did tell you about our traditions.
But not about animal offerings.
I give you space to be yourself, as well.
I would appreciate it, if you would do the same.
Live and let live?
Tell your sheep.
What?
Here we go. Three, two, one, roll over.
Roll over.
-Barry? -Hi.
We need to talk.
I followed all the lists perfectly. And she even did an afternoon nap.
It's not about that.
Did you see that?
-Incredible. -Amazing.
Mia is able to roll over, finally.
I'm so relieved.
What did you want to say?
They offered to make me a partner.
What, you're kidding?
This is such an amazing day.
-We need to celebrate. -Yes.
Sleep, baby, sleep, outside there is a sheep.
You can put it here. Thank you.
-Hey congratulations, bro. -Thanks.
A small contribution for the little one.
-Thank you. -Here you go.
This is too much, I can't accept it.
Yes, you can. You can take a holiday with Samih.
Hey, sweetie.
I bet you're looking forward to Monday.
I can't wait until Mia goes to day care.
-Teun and Mia are in the same group. -Really?
-And they have an amazing teacher. -How nice.
Teun isn't feeling great. He needs rest instead of all this commotion.
Yeah, I get it. I'll take him to the nursery.
That would be amazing, thank you.
That's nice.
Hey. Hey, sweetie.
Come with your aunt.
-Is everything okay? -Definitely.
-You're looking good. -Thank you.
-Very smooth. -Nice party, right?
So what have you been up to? 'Cause I don't see you anymore now.
-Hey -Hey, it's okay.
-It's a nice party. -It is.
They even decorated the sheep.
Do people know it will be sacrificed?
-Well, they'll find out soon enough. -Yes.
Anne.
Did you fire Hester?
Yes.
Why didn't we discuss that?
If you could keep your dick in your pants, we could talk about it.
-What are you talking about? -You were jerking off with her photos.
Sweetie, it was just a fantasy. It didn't mean anything.
It's disgusting. You don't jerk off to your nanny as some horny teenager.
Where are Ilse and Samih?
They're in the nursery.
Hester.
I'll go get her.
Come on, we need to change your clothes.
Your clothes.
Come on, this way.
Let's go. Good boy.
-Hi, have you seen Ilse? -No.
-Okay, tell her we're going to start. -I will.
We didn't see anyone.
-Can we talk? -Not now. I can't find Ilse.
It's urgent, I want to start legal proceedings against Kim and Roos.
-I can't see the kids anymore. -Hold on, I'll come back to that.
Yes, It'll be over soon.
Go ahead. Go ahead, sheep.
-Where's Ilse? -I can't find her anywhere.
Mom, we need to wait for Ilse. -What are we going to say to our guest?
She's coming. I don't care what they say.
She has affected your mind. She's embarrassing us.
Mom, enough. I won't begin without her.
No, wait.
-This is not Samih. -What do you mean?
-Bro, I just grabbed a baby. -Oh no.
Oh, no, no, no. This can't be happening.
-Hey, sweetie. -What did you do?
Did you circumcise Teun?
It was an accident.
You've mutilated my child.
Me? Why is this my fault?
You were watching Teun. You're an awful mother.
Not here.
Like you're such a perfect mother.
You manipulate everyone, you act like a dictator.
-I only tried to help you. -Help me?
Stop it, you only think about yourself and you don't care who gets hurt.
I want nothing do to with you or your creepy club anymore.
You're like a cult.
-You can forget about that day care. -Kim, will you keep taking things away?
-What? -Don't be such a hypocrite.
-You reported me to Child Services. -No, I didn't.
Only you know about my past.
I would never do that.
-Anne, why? -I can explain.
Hicham, it was Hicham, okay?
I can't just accept it. What do you think?
No, right?
What? You think it's my fault?
Maybe.
Maybe you're right.
Yes.
It's more fun with him around.
-Mama. -What?
Mama? Yes, Mia. Yes.
I'm your mama.
-Barry… -Mama.
It really calms him down.
-Yes. -My mother used to sing that to me.
Maybe she'll come back.
I wouldn't count on it.
You've offended her.
And what about me? Do I just have to accept everything?
Of course not.
But why didn't you say anything?
I didn't want to disappoint you.
You're doing so great. Mommy is so proud of you.
Fortunately, he's almost back to himself again.
Yes, fortunately he is.
Why did you never tell me?
I wanted kids with someone I trust.
I get it, but you should've told me.
-So I could've decided myself. -You pushed us into doing what you wanted.
Without thinking about me or the kids.
-I'm trying to protect our kids. -You did great.
It worked.
Hey, sweetie.
Nice job.
Daddy, can I stay with you tonight?
-That's not possible right now. -Why not?
It's grown-up stuff, sweetie.
Have you come to twist the knife a bit more?
I want to help you get your kids back.
If you want me to.
-No, never mind. -I get you never want to see me again.
I was so worried about being the perfect mother, and the day care center.
So, to be the perfect mother, you betray your friends?
I'm sorry.
I never should've done it.
I lost sight of what was important. My friends, Barry.
You make it all so fucking difficult.
Nobody can be the perfect mother, you're just starting out.
She's the perfect mother.
And I was the perfect father.
So, maybe I could come in third place?
I'm so sorry, really.
And talk to Barry, he feels awful.
-Yes, okay. -Yes?
Guys, my water broke.
-What? -Here? No.
-Are you okay? Are you in pain? -No.
-Come, sweetie. -Kim isn't answering.
-I'll go find Kim and I'll take the kids. -Should I carry you?
-No. -Come on, not too fast.
-Are you sure you're okay? No pain? -No.
The baby's coming. Are you okay?
-You forgot Teun. -Sorry.
Your sister is coming.
I'm coming.
The numbers don't lie. Teen pregnancies increase every year.
And those young girls have no idea about the responsibilities.
Kim.
-I've called you, like, ten times. -Why are you here?
Roos is in labor, she's in the hospital with Kaj.
And you took care of my kids?
Moms for moms, right?
-What are we waiting for? -Shall I take care of the kids?
If you can, that would be great. Thank you.
See you later, Roos is in labor.
Hey, Didi.
Doing great. Doing great.
-Are you okay? Do you want water? -No.
Kaj, I promise I will set it right with Kim.
That's not important now. Focus on the baby.
You're completely dilated.
But you need a C-section.
-No, I want a natural birth. -Why?
The baby is in a breech position and we can't wait.
It will increase the risk of complications. Nurses?
We need to go to the operation room.
-I'm here with you. -Where's Kim?
She's on her way and I'm staying with you.
-I'm staying with you. -You have to stay here.
-Are we on time? -They're working on her.
There are complications, the baby is in the wrong position.
-Where is she? -They're operating on her now.
-What? -The doctor is with her
and she's strong. You know how strong she is.
Hello.
I'm sorry if I offended you.
That was never my intention.
-But it's our tradition. -You're right.
But I also have my standards and values.
I want Samih to learn about both cultures.
So he learns from it and enjoys it.
I want the same thing.
I'm fine with the circumcision, but I don't want to sacrifice a sheep.
Okay, deal.
No sheep.
And you're always welcome, you can stop by whenever you want.
-But I can't stay over? -Of course, we're family.
Yes.
Do you want to come to the market with me?
-Yes. -The mother lost a lot of blood
but mother and child are both fine.
-Really? -They're resting now.
-Can we see her? -Of course you can.
Thank you.
-Do you want to come? -I'll come by later.
There's something I need to do.
Give Roos a kiss from me, I'll see you later.
Oh, sweetie.
Hey, sweetie.
-You really scared us. How are you? -Fine.
-Are you okay? -Yes.
You can do the next one.
Do you want more children?
Can I please hold her?
Sweet girl.
Do you want to hold her? Here.
Oh, shit! She's so small.
Hey, I'm your daddy.
How are you?
You have the prettiest and sweetest moms in the world.
-Yes, hi. -Your dad is not so bad either.
He still needs to learn some things, but we'll help him.
You're so small. I'm sure you're tired, it was a long journey.
Can Didi and Teun stay with you tonight?
It might be easier, the next couple of days.
Of course, I'd love to.
Yes.
She's amazing. Nice job, she's so pretty.
And she's so calm.
There, what you put on the drawings, we didn't get to finish that part.
-No problem. -You were pretty late.
Anne, what are you doing here?
You're right.
I've been a complete control freak.
I want the best for Mia and I wanted it all to be perfect and I went too far.
I also want the best for her.
She said the word "Mama".
-Really? -Yes.
Did she also say Papa?
Not yet.
But I wanted to share this with you.
I want to share everything with you.
Will you please come home?
Back to Mia and me?
On one condition.
That you throw away the baby monitor.
And no more jerking off to the nanny.
Otherwise I want a manny.
One, two, three.
Nice job, Mia.
Congratulations, sweetie.
-Sweetie. -Who wants cake?
-Me. -Well…
We're also having a party next month.
-Oh, what's the reason? -Samih's circumcision.
-You're all invited. -We'll leave the baby at home this time.
Hester is babysitting next week.
Oh, that's nice.
So, how are you?
You have to increase my dosage.
- Captain Riva... - Leonida.
Leonida.
I can go on dosing you up with drugs until you forget your own name.
Or we can try to come up with something else.
Otherwise, it will be impossible for me to help you.
If you want to help me, increase the dosage.
They invited me to Saturday’s match.
- Is your son playing? - No...
Teresa, the little one.
The kids will come over for dinner afterwards, so...
I don't want to...
I want to stay calm while I am with them.
There's a support group tomorrow at 11:00.
Talking to someone can help you.
You could try at least...
Maybe on Saturday, with your wife...
Do I tell her about 30 years of military missions, at the match?
Not more than one every eight hours.
And come back next week,
so we will understand if we need to make adjustments.
Easy!
Go!
Ref! That's a high tackle!
Teresa is getting good.
I didn't know you train her.
When do you play?
Look, I'm not six years old.
Can you please let me through?
Thank you.
- Do you need a fork? - Yes, please.
How are you?
How about you?
I'm fine.
About tonight, do we stick to our plan?
- If you don't feel like it... - No, it's ok.
Fine.
The only thing is that Terry doesn't eat cheese.
It's been a month. I don't know why.
It was her choice. All of a sudden.
Have you seen Mattia?
Yes, I...
I met him before.
Ok.
Ok, see you later.
- Mom. - Honey.
Where's my pink sweater?
- Did you check the clothes rack? - Right.
Thank you, dear.
What's the matter?
Are you sure it's just a business dinner?
Wait.
Get him something.
A dessert.
- It means a lot to your sister. - I know.
- Come on! - I'm going.
- Why are we stopping here? - Get off.
- Aren't we going to dad's? - Get off, Terry.
Come on! How about a nice burger?
Come on!
- Thank you. - Here you go.
It's eleven twenty.
There you go.
- I'll get your change. - Thank you.
Cool.
Come on, dig in.
You are always eating!
We are a little late.
- Hi, little girl. - Hello, kitty!
Hi!
Bye, sweetie.
- Terry, I'll be back in five minutes. - Where are you guys going?
Just back there, wait here.
The coach says he won't cap me anymore,
if I don't go back to two training sessions a week.
He's right. Serves you right.
- My father doesn't let me out... - Right, your father...
- You mean Miss Marini... - Ouch!
She keeps you on a leash, like a puppy.
At least I get laid.
At what cost?
- Teddy bear! - Shut up.
Stop screaming. Shut up.
You have to come back. Scrums with Montedoro suck.
- Yes sir, my captain. - Good boy.
You could always leave Miss Marini to Teddy Bear 2 and me!
Shut your mouth.
How bad do you wanna bang her?
She is big-boned.
We'll take turns fucking her.
Terry?
- What happened ? - I saw a Jeep rushing away.
Excuse me?
Have you seen a little girl, red hair?
I came out as I heard her screaming.
Terry?
Terry?
Teresa?
Teresa?
Terry!
I don't know, I just saw a Jeep...
Mattia, go talk to the waitress.
Mattia, where are you? Dad, I don't know what happened...
Calm down, please...
Mattia, I don't understand.
I swear, she just disappeared.
Are you sure?
Yes, I think so.
Where are you?
At the fast food right behind mom's house.
How long it has been?
I don't know, dad, ten minutes I think.
Are you alone?
Call the police. And don't move.
I'm on my way.
Get a couple of officers, take a look around.
Try to figure out if anybody has seen or heard something.
Mister Riva?
Deputy Chief Basilio Simonetti.
We alerted every police station,
the forensic team is coming...
Did you manage to reach her mother?
Not yet.
I understand.
Excuse me for a moment.
Patrol car S38 speaking.
We noticed a suspect vehicle, a Jeep.
It’s running fast on viale San Giorgio towards the shopping center.
- Pull it over. - Copy that.
It's not stopping.
Suspect vehicle on the run!
We need backup, the Jeep is too fast!
Turn there!
Fuck... The Jeep has just turned.
Alert the flying squad.
- Escort everyone to the police station. - Yes.
You two, come with me.
What the fuck is he doing?
Sir, they're headed out of town, we can't keep up with them.
Mister Riva, stop!
I'm fine.
For Christ's sake...
Turning to Via di Secondo Beneventano.
We're getting closer. Proceeding on Viale delle Muse.
Watch out!
Pick up...
Pick up!
Fuck you!
They have just reported to us the disappearance of a six year old girl
in the premises of a fast food restaurant, north of town.
The police hasn't released any official statement yet
but according to some rumors it could be a kidnapping.
Several witnesses on the crime scene
claim they saw a suspect vehicle running away...
What do we have?
Within 50 kilometers, we have 21 suspects with criminal records...
21? What about the Jeep?
The license plate is stolen...
- Traffic cameras? - Traffic cameras?
- Nothing yet. - Good Lord!
First Captain Leonida Riva.
30 years in the Special Forces.
12 missions in high-risk areas...
Somalia, Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda,
collaborations with Americans in Afghanistan...
and then a mission that started badly and ended up worse.
"Three years after discharge, the patient is still highly unstable, "tends towards isolation,
"shows high levels of social, psychological and physical disability."
He refused treatment, so they started dosing him up with drugs.
What if he has something to do with the kidnapping?
He must have made a few enemies in the past.
His wife just came in.
Maybe we can convince her to get in touch with him...
Riva is not coming back.
He knows he has lost any chance of a friendly dialogue with us.
The investigation is too delicate, he will screw everything up.
We have to stop this man.
Come here.
This is a self-service, handsome.
- Look, do you sell... - What do you need?
I need a lot of this stuff.
You want to go wild!
Ok.
Wait here.
- You're right, he does look like a cop. - I told you!
Guys, I just need information.
Go away.
You'd better not.
Tell me who deals it.
I don't know.
Please, I don't want to die.
You're gonna beg me to kill you.
The Mastiffs! It's their stuff.
Tell where I can find them.
What the fuck are you doing?
What do you mean, someone followed you? What did you do?
Yes.
I'll meet you there, yes.
I'm going to help you with the Jeep.
Mom...
May I speak with you for a second?
Any news from Mr. Riva?
Can you think of someone who might have been targeting you?
Maybe a former colleague of your husband,
a superior...
No...
Alright.
We'll call you as soon as we have news.
For anything, this is my personal number.
Open it up...
Come here.
I thought you were gonna run away with one of his sluts...
What the fuck are you saying?
- Do you have some stuff? - Yes.
Here.
Come on.
How much is this? Did you count it?
No, we gotta get rid of the car.
Where is my daughter?
- Who do you work for? - Nobody, we work for nobody.
Where is she?
Who did you sell her to?
Who did you sell her to?
Stop.
Shit.
Go.
The disappearance of little Teresa Riva is officially a kidnapping.
Public Prosecutor's office has promptly opened a case and locked the city down.
These are hours of fear, crucial for the life of the disappeared child.
According to the investigators, a kidnapping without a ransom note
would mean that the police has very little time to find the girl...
Sir...
Is there anything I can do?
I don't know.
Take a seat.
I know it's not easy.
And it's no use to tell you to be calm.
But we're doing everything we can to find your sister.
But you can stay close to your mother.
Stick together.
Mattia? I have to ask you to leave the office.
- So? - We managed to catch the Jeep.
It changed several license plates in the past four months,
but there is a pattern. It went through this road regularly this week.
What do we have in the area?
There is a shipyard.
There is more.
Just before the Jeep came through here tonight.
Take a look.
It's Riva's car.
I knew it.
- Do you think that he... - I think that he...
I think that he is a former soldier on medication,
who ran from a crime scene and made us lose the track of who was likely to be our kidnapper.
And now he appears again around the only suspect area we were able to identify.
And what do we do?
Do we believe in coincidence, now? What the fuck!
My house is under surveillance.
I'm sorry.
There are more bandages in there.
I'll get them.
The number you dialed...
If you know something, you must tell the police.
Let's go to the police station.
Let's go together.
Mattia is there.
He needs you.
- If you go it alone, you'll die. - At least our daughter will be safe.
Lights are on.
That's strange.
What's wrong?
Maybe Riva has nothing to do with it.
Maybe we're just following the same lead,
and he is ahead of us.
Are we doing the "pissed-off boss" routine?
Come on, let's go.
Is anybody there?
Is there anyone?
What do you need?
Hello.
I know it's late, but... our car broke down over there.
Please! Can you lend us some cables? We have been traveling since this morning...
My boss is a little nervous.
Nervous?
He looks like an asshole to me.
Wait here.
- So, where's the car? - At the gate.
Your colleague kindly offered himself to...
Ok, but you can't be here. Come on.
Let's go to that gate and fix your car.
May I ask you a question?
Here...
do you work with open flames?
- Who the fuck are you? - Police, drop your weapons.
- Drop that gun. - Yes.
Tell your friend not to fuck around or I'll blow his head off.
Ok, easy, easy...
You'd better not.
I'm going to put my gun down now.
Listen...
There is a sniper squad ready to fire, if anything goes wrong.
Easy.
Keep calm.
It's gonna be alright.
What do you want? We are looking for the owner of an old Jeep.
No. Fuck.
Hey!
We found a burned body. 30-year-old male.
They must have gotten rid of him an hour ago, tops.
What about the Jeep?
They found it.
At the scrap yard.
Look, there is something more.
We found this, near the body.
We have to examine it, but...
it's a baby tooth.
After the kidnapping, he called the girl and a different number three times.
Can we trace it?
What do you know about these people?
They were talking about a man and his prostitutes.
Keep him on the line for at least 20-30 seconds.
Hello? - Hi, they gave me your number. - Who's there?
- Hi, they gave me your number. - Who's there?
I need... some girls.
I need... some girls. - About ten, for a party. - Do you know what time it is?
- About ten, for a party. - Do you know what time it is?
My boss is very demanding.
For when?
Tomorrow.
Quiet! Fucking dog.
- Now I'm busy. - Wait.
Northbound road, past viale Maria Valerio. Look.
You have an overall radius of two hundred meters.
It will be hard to find him.
It will have to do.
Leonida Riva,
nobody's son.
"The beast".
No way you changed, fuck.
Neither did you.
Hey.
I've lost four pounds.
I know how you feel.
You can't wait to jump into the void,
to go back on a mission...
It's the only thing we know how to do, right?
Where did it happen?
There was this moment, after the blast...
They were taking me away in a helicopter.
I was messed up, so high on morphine.
But I definitely remember one thing.
I was bleeding to death and thinking:
"Fuck, if I can't walk anymore, I can't fight anymore".
Going back to a normal life looked like a nightmare to me.
But then...
I realized I was neither the first nor the last one feeling that way.
That I could survive,
because someone, before me, did make it.
Knowing this was enough for me.
Take care, Leo.
Captain.
We're bringing you back home now.
There are more!
Easy, easy!
Go, go, go.
- Go, go! - For Christ's sake.
Downstairs!
Move, move!
Go!
My wife would have complained.
But I never complain, you know...
Mozart, please...
I have nothing to do with it, I swear. Please...
Your boss told me something different.
- I didn't want to... - Neither do I.
If it were not for you and your Prince Charming.
The cops are breathing down our necks.
I've made an ass of myself with a client, a big one.
To make matters worse, we are stuck with that girl who's worth shit now.
How is that possible? We took her that age on purpose.
So you do have something to do with it?
I mean, we took her that age because you told us that...
you can place girls that age in a second.
- Exactly. - That's why we did it.
It's all my fault.
Get rid of her first thing in the morning. We've made enough of a mess tonight.
What about the girl?
The deal is off.
Everybody is looking for her, we couldn't leave her there.
Make her disappear too.
What's up?
Oh you poor things, you're breaking my heart...
I'll deal with that. Go get her.
Hurry up!
Hello?
Ivan, hi!
Did you see the picture? Only the best for my friends.
That's the price, I'm sorry.
Tomorrow is fine.
Dasvidania.
What's happening?
It happens that the world is a wonderful place.
Full of fucking perverts.
That is?
That is, take the girl and bring her back there.
Come on.
What is happening? We are bringing you back.
What now?
I need to go to the toilet.
Hurry, or the boss's gonna be mad.
Open up! Open the fuck up!
Dad!
Who the fuck are you?
Dad!
Upstairs!
They kept me in a dark room, isolated.
They wanted intelligence.
Then the rescue team came to save me.
They killed them pretty fast.
I tried to take one out.
They cut his throat.
Captain Riva,
your conduct during the imprisonment was exemplary.
The Secret Services followed the ops closely
and were impressed by your skills.
They could use someone like you.
They want to bury me under State secrets, don't they, General?
It's a promotion, Riva.
Speak your mind, Captain.
I feel you want to make your point, please.
Yes.
The rescue mission was too dangerous.
You know better than me you should have left me there, General.
Or, if you didn't trust me
Or, if you didn't trust me you should have bombed the whole area.
instead of sending an entire squad to their death.
In front of my eyes.
Think of what the Services are offering. It's an opportunity, think it over.
I don't need to think it over, General.
I request discharge and immediate return.
Keep your eyes open, sir.
Go!
Would you like some?
Thank you.
They said they won't let us in until the deputy chief arrives.
You know...
When I met your father...
he was finishing the training course.
He pretended to speak Arabic.
He made me laugh.
Then he stopped.
When he came back home after his discharge...
he had become bitter.
Distracted.
A stranger.
And you kicked him out.
He is the one who left.
I wanted him to stay,
I wanted to deal with it together,
as a family.
But it was like your father was afraid to get some help.
He wanted to protect us, by keeping us away.
I hated him.
Even if...
I've never stopped loving him.
Sorry...
Mrs. Riva...
- May I? - No.
I need to see if he's ok.
Please.
Thank you.
Where is your mother?
She is smoking downstairs.
Police have found some remains of a body.
They are trying to understand if...
It's not Teresa.
I saw her.
She's fine.
Come here.
I need your help.
Ok...
Check my medical records.
See if there is a paper clip.
Stay out of sight.
- It's there. - Good.
Good.
Now open it.
Hand it to me.
Stay there. Stay there.
Come on.
Good.
Now...
Now it may happen
that the guard gets suspicious and comes in.
Ok.
If that happens,
I need you to run and close the door.
Then you stay there and don't move, no matter what happens next.
Ok.
- Understood? - Yes.
Now.
Open this fucking door! Open!
Easy, easy. Easy...
Shit.
Wait.
Stay there.
Move back.
Now take the radio and call the station.
You have to run a check on a previous offender.
His nickname is Mozart.
I want to know where I can find him.
Station, this is officer Petrassi speaking. I need to run a check.
Name and surname, please.
I only have a nickname, Mozart.
Just a second.
I only have one match. Gianrico Sala, 50 years old...
I only have one match. Gianrico Sala, 50 years old... He did his time twice.
The system reports a building downtown in his name,
several apartments out of town, and a restaurant, "The Black Pearl", all legit.
There is also a wellness centre that went bankrupt a couple of years ago,
on the last floor of Skytower, its name is "Two of hearts".
Dad!
Petrassi, the deputy chief is here, do I let him come upstairs?
Give me the radio.
Fast.
Petrassi, do you copy?
Get down.
- Petrassi, what's happening? - Handcuff yourself.
Dad.
Please, don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Freeze!
Drop the guns.
Drop the guns!
The first results have arrived, it's not her.
The remains belong to somebody who died six months ago.
Riva is on the run.
Stay here.
Oh my goodness, help!
Get out!
Riva!
Riva!
Fuck.
Call the police.
Tell them where they can catch up with me.
On Sunday we have the qualifying match for the first division.
Try to get back.
Ivan!
Privet!
Would you like something to drink?
You'll see, you're going to like her.
Considering how much it costs... Money is hell.
What's wrong?
You bastard!
I kill you!
I kill you!
Now, you die.
Dad.
You found me.
It's ok, now.
Where is mom?
We’re going back home, now.
We'll find her.
No.
Please...
I'm sorry.
Let us go.
I'm begging you...
Be careful, it's hot.
- Wait a moment. - Where are you going?
I'll be right back.
Thank you.
We found a body, at the shipyard...
DNA tests confirmed...
it’s a little girl who disappeared in the North, a few months ago.
We found... at least two related cases.
And we're gonna find more.
Now that we have a lead between Mozart and the Mastiffs.
Riva...
You did a good job.
I’d like to bring her back to her mother first.
- How’s your tea? - It's hot.
A MONTH LATER
I'd like to thank you all.
Seeing your long faces,
I realize that it could have been worse.
Much worse.
Does anybody want to say something?
He never speaks.
That's true! You are half off your nut, aren't you?
Everybody says you are happy, you think you are in a hotel.
Fuck, I'd like to be in a hotel too.
What was your job?
I was...
I worked in the army.
four reichsmark.
So, if the German family costs 5.50 reichsmark a day to live,
but the cost to feed and care for one person with a hereditary disease
is 12 reichsmark a day,
what is the difference in value lost to the German people?
Karl.
Well, if it costs so much to take care of these people,
what do we do?
[boy] You kill them.
Does anyone have a more productive and humane solution?
All right. Well, why don't we focus on the arithmetic instead?
Well, we put zero here.
And we carry the one.
Six.
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
-Lead us not into temptation-- -Even the Nazis?
We all have a part to play, sweet boy.
Do you really believe all that stuff from today?
[scoffs] That is only the curriculum they give me, Peter.
We've talked about this.
You have to think for yourself.
No calculation can measure the worth of a life.
But what I do know is that I love you.
Will you stay until I fall asleep?
Of course.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil,
for thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory forever and ever.
Amen.
[officer] You, there. Where is the Weber household?
Do you know?
[officer] Subject lives here.
-Weber family! -Now!
No.
One moment!
-No. I don't want to go. -Remember.
-[officer] Weber family! -Everything is at the barn.
Everything is at the barn, and they will meet you there.
[officer] We know you are in there!
Kick in the door.
[officer] Move away! -[woman exclaims] -[gun fires]
[officer] Go, go, go! Now!
[officer] Looks damaged! Check the boards.
-[soldier] It won't hold. -[officer] Go around!
Back up. Back up!
It's okay.
[officer] You, look over there.
[officer] There are reports of this barn being used for resistance.
[whispering] Stay here. I'll lead them away from you.
[officer] Search back there.
[Peter] Over here!
-[grunts] Out for a run, are we, huh? -[Peter exclaiming]
Quite a day rounding up all the loose ends in the cow towns.
Anything to say, boy?
Heil Hitler!
-Enough! [grunting] -[Peter grunting]
what is wrong with Black people?
What is wrong with Black people?
What is wrong with Black people?
Okay, what do you mean by that?
What is wrong with Black people?
[Kendi] In 1860,
Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis, on the floor of the US Senate,
opposed a bill funding education for Black people.
To justify this, he made up this story he said was from the Bible.
he made up this story he said was from the Bible.
[Kendi] In this made-up fairy tale,
when Cain was exiled from the Garden of Eden,
he comes across the Land of Nod.
[Kendi] And in this Land of Nod, according to Senator Davis,
were the animals and beasts
that were created before humans, before Adam and Eve.
[Kendi] And among these beasts,
was a particular animal-like group, with darker skin.
[Kendi] Senator Davis was talking about Black people.
"Black inferiority is the will of God," he said, "as confirmed by history."
That's the story that Senator Davis told.
The same Senator Davis who would go on to become the president of the Confederate States of America
to become the president of the Confederate States of America
to justify this idea that the inequality between the Black and white races
was "stamped from the beginning."
[Dr. Carol Anderson] What happens when we tell these stories, these myths,
about who Black people are,
and what their role in American society is?
These stories that are all about what's wrong with Black people
become part of the background understandings
that help to then spread ideas, false ideas, about Black people.
[Dr. Imani Perry] We need to look at our history with a sober perspective.
There's a real battle,
and it's a meaningful battle over ideas.
[Brittany Packnett Cunningham] So the question is,
how are we intentionally questioning what is being given to us,
and what we are ingesting?
Because somebody is designing it.
Are they designing it for our benefit or for theirs?
[Honorée Fanonne Jeffers] When we look at race,
we have to look at the fact that race has not always been a given.
[Jeffers] We came across that water, and we were Fula,
we were Igbo, we were Yoruba, Wolof.
we were Igbo, we were Yoruba, Wolof. We were Mandinka.
But somewhere across the Atlantic,
we became one community.
Often times we assume that race is only about the color of one's skin,
the grade of one's hair, or whatever.
It is about slavery.
I think it's important for people to know that the original "slave,"
when people thought about that-- that original slave,
it wasn't people who look like me.
The Western European slave market
had been dominated for hundreds of years by Eastern European Slavs.
The root for the term slave is Slav.
So why suddenly, are we primarily enslaving, you know, African people?
[Dr. Jennifer L. Morgan] We need to remember that slavery, it's a piece of human history.
Humans enslave each other.
They have for as long as there have been empires and states and war,
but something different happens in 1444.
It's the moment in which the first large cargo of captives,
who are captured by the Portuguese in Senegambia,
are brought to Portugal to be sold.
That, for me, is the beginning of what becomes the transatlantic slave trade.
is the beginning of what becomes the transatlantic slave trade.
[Kendi] Prince Henry of Portugal
saw the value of African people in Western European slave markets.
They were more valuable than Eastern European Slavs
because it was harder for them to run away.
It was harder for them to blend in to the population.
And so he financed expeditions to the source.
[Lynae Vanee] When Prince Henry rode up on Africa,
there was an opportunity for him to take something.
There was a method that he used to get what he wanted, and it worked.
[Kendi] Prince Henry didn't want to admit
that he was violently and brutally enslaving African people to make money.
And so he dispatched a royal chronicler by the name of Gomes Zurara,
to write his story.
[Kendi] Gomes Zurara justified his slave trading
by stating that Prince Henry was doing it to save souls,
and that these people in Africa were inferior, were beast-like.
[Zurara] They have lived like beasts
without any custom of reasonable beings.
They have no understanding of good,
but only know how to live in a bestial sloth.
[Kendi] Gomes Zurara's book wasn't just the first major text by a European written in Africa,
wasn't just the first major text by a European written in Africa,
it also became a bestseller.
These racist ideas of African people as beastly
started circulating around Western Europe.
[Dr. Autumn Womack] The work is naturalizing these racial hierarchies.
They're indoctrinating us.
I mean, that's how popular culture works, and that's how power works, right?
We don't realize it's working until it's done its job.
[Jeffers] In order for you to do that and to make yourself feel good about it,
you've got to come up with a reason why it was okay.
Otherwise, what you have is brutality, you have theft,
what you have is brutality, you have theft, you have murder, you have rape.
Nobody wants to think of themselves that way. Okay?
[Kendi] Gomes Zurara wrote
that people with different skin colors, and different languages,
and different cultures from different nations,
were one people. One Black people.
One Black people worthy of enslavement.
[man 1] The Blackness.
-[man 2] What's wrong with them? -[man 1] The Blackness.
[man 3] Nobody in the town has any use for 'em. Nobody likes 'em. Nobody wants 'em.
Some niggers are clean and some aren't. I wished I had some chicken.
I wished I had some chicken.
[man 4] The Negro in this country today stands for venereal disease,
prostitution, the numbers racket,
and crime.
[angry woman] Wetback, sand nigger, motherfucking cocksucking bitch!
Go back where you came from!
[man, offscreen] Look at what you're doing! This is my neighborhood…
-[man, filming] Okay. Victims. -You brought these people who are crazy.
[man, offscreen] You're-- Look, look. Hey.

Somebody told a lie one day.
They made everything Black ugly and evil!
Look in your dictionary and see the synonyms of the word "black."
[Kendi] Gomes Zurara invented Blackness.
But he didn't necessarily create whiteness.
And whiteness as a construct
really didn't start to emerge until the 1500s,
really didn't start to emerge until the 1500s, and certainly the 1600s.
[Dr. Brittney Cooper] In the early days of the slave trade here in the US,
Black people weren't the only enslaved people.
We had indentured servants from Europe, who were trying to make their way,
and they lived in conditions that were just one step above slavery.
[Dr. Dorothy Roberts] One of the greatest fears of white landowners
was that white indentured servants and Black enslaved people
would come together in their common interest
to fight against the white elite.
And it became clear that this was a real possibility
during an incident called Bacon's Rebellion,
when Black people and white people joined together
when Black people and white people joined together to revolt against white landowners.
[James Baldwin] But it's not a matter of my liberation.
It's also a matter of yours.
If you're working-- we're working together,
it's not because we're gonna do something for poor Black people.
We're gonna do something for each other.

[William Bouie Haden] Is it too much to ask you to grant us human dignity?

[Kendi] Bacon's Rebellion was able at one point to topple the capital of Virginia,
It scared wealthy white enslavers to death.
[Kendi] They saw that unity
between white indentured servants and enslaved Africans,
you know, as their Armageddon.
[Roberts] That made it very clear to white landowners
that they needed to invest more
in separating indentured servants and enslaved people.
They created a whole legal apparatus
to give indentured servants privileges
by the fact that they were white,
that Black people couldn't have.
[Kendi] Ultimately, some of those white indentured servants
were able to work out their indenture.
And then they were able to receive land
and to make money.
And then the money they were able to acquire,
allowed them to buy one of the very people
that were involved, side-by-side with them,
for Bacon's Rebellion.
And then they could turn around and say to their former comrade,
"You're in your position and I'm in my position,
not because of racist policies."
"You're in your position because you're inferior."
They want to throw white children and colored children
into the melting pot of integration,
out of which will come a conglomerated, mulatto, mongrel class of people!
Both races will be destroyed in such a movement.
America was built by and for

it's also a matter of national survival.
We have no choice.
If we teach our children to hate America,
there will be no one left to defend our flag,
or to protect our great country or its freedom.
[Roberts] This is the beginning of the idea
that whiteness itself is a benefit, is a privilege, is a status that white people should want to have
is a status that white people should want to have
to the disadvantage of Black people.

[Roberts] Whiteness is an idea
of who is entitled to certain privileges in a society.
[Perry] Whiteness keeps you from being at the bottom, even when you're poor, even when you're broke,
even when you're poor, even when you're broke, even when you're dispossessed.
It's something that has been really a core part
of what I think white American identity is.
There's something that you always know you have over other people.
[Cunningham] Once upon a time, if you were Polish and you came here,
you weren't white, you were Polish.
If you were Italian and you came here, you weren't white, you were Italian.
But somewhere along the line, folks figured out,
"Hey, if we link arms under this umbrella of whiteness,
then we can protect our collective interest
and make sure nobody has access to our power."
[Kendi] What whiteness does, is it blinds them
to see who the real robbers are.
[Roberts] The people who actually benefit
are a small group of wealthy, white elite
that continues to accumulate its wealth and power
on the backs of everybody else.
[chanting] Hear our voice! Hear our voice!
[Kendi] You have white folks who are struggling economically,
and they think the source of their pain
is people who don't look like them.

[protester] We don't need outsiders helping us with our problems.
We've been doing good all these years we've been here,
and we'll keep doing good enough. And we'll stay white, period.
[chanting] You will not replace us! You will not replace us!
[Vanee] Race is not a thing. Race is not scientifically proven.
You cannot trace somebody's race in their DNA,
but it has so many real social ramifications
because of the amount of people who have bought into the myth.
[interviewer] Do you think a Negro family moving here will affect the community?
Some of them, they're real dirty.
But I wouldn't mind it if, you know, they kept the neighborhood clean.
Well, it just depends upon that type of Negro.
If they were like the, uh, Negro that works for me,
a fine, upstanding woman who is proud of being a nigger,
proud of her race, clean and industrious,
no, I would not mind.
[Cunningham] There is… a temporary prize
that whiteness loves to dangle in front of the rest of us.
Temporary prize of acceptance, of upliftment.
If you go to the right schools and you speak the King's English,
and you never step out of line and you tell the truth,
but never too much truth to make whiteness uncomfortable.
If you are just the right kind of Negro.
Let me put it to you this way.
We are proud of being Black
and of our Black Heritage.
But white America does not accept the concept
that this is a multiracial society.
They've always looked upon America as being white,
and hence, all of its propaganda is directed at us, to convince us
that somehow we must become white before they will accept us.
There's no other way to think. I can't think African. Can't think Irish.
I can't think Norwegian.
I have to think within the struct--
the society in which I live, which is a white society.
Does it bother you to be called African-American?
-It does because I'm a Cablinasian. -[Oprah] A Cablinasian.
[Dr. Kellie Carter Jackson] Assimilationist ideas are problematic
because it compels you to sort of shape-shift
because it compels you to sort of shape-shift into something that white people can approve of,
that white people won't feel threatened by,
that white people can feel, sort of safe in.
"Why can't you just be white?" You know? "Just assimilate."
If you are Black and living a contemporary Black experience,
you probably have code switched at some point in time.
Hey, youngblood, lemme give you a tip.
Use your white voice.
Man, I ain't got no white voice.
Come on, you know what I mean. You have a white voice in there, you can use it.
You have a white voice in there, you can use it.
I'm just trying to give you some game.
[Dr. Ruha Benjamin] An assimilationist still adheres to the idea
that a racialized group needs to change.
"They need to work harder, they need to value education,
they need to take care about their health more."
[Womack] It's a different iteration of inferiority,
that there's no value in what you have to offer.
You either have to assimilate into this way,
or we need to create something different, a different infrastructure,
to account for your problematic presence.
A high school senior was told he can't walk the stage for graduation
or even return to normal classes unless he cuts his dreadlocks.
There's an element of being a progressive in that,
because you believe people can change.

[Benjamin] That's the refrain we hear, whether it's in 2021 or in 1821.
"There's something in you, either in your body or in your culture,
that is producing the difference we're looking at."
Who taught you to hate the texture of your hair?
Who taught you to hate the color of your skin to such extent

[Morgan] In the 18th century,
European and American philosophers are arguing
that Black people should only be working.
That Black bodies are only good for brute labor
because the highest form of human expression is European,
and the lowest form is African.
That the only place where good art and higher thinking is happening,
is in Europe or among people of European descent.
They are so accustomed to the stories they've been telling about Black people,
that they literally cannot imagine that a Black woman could produce art.

[Kendi] But, of course, you had some people that were like,

a group of prominent Boston white men gathered together to investigate,
and they brought Phillis Wheatley before them to really ascertain whether she actually was the one who wrote those poems.
to really ascertain whether she actually was the one who wrote those poems.
[Morgan] In that interrogation, she's being asked to prove
that she is more than what these white men see her as,
which is as just a Black woman. Just a slave.
[Morgan] It sets an example, both of the need for Black women to constantly prove worth,
but it also sets this kind of presumption
that white men have the right to ask you to prove your worth.
[Jeffers] Every Black woman has a Phillis Wheatley moment.
[Jeffers] The most painful moment was a colleague of mine who said,

[Jeffers] When we think about white supremacy,
when we think about racism,
when you pull back the curtain,
you see the filth.
There is a myth about the founding of this country.
People want to erase American history as it truly was.
White supremacy has been embedded
in this country since its founding.
[sighs] You really want to talk about Thomas Jefferson?
Okay.
Thomas "Contradiction" Jefferson. [chuckles]
There are few people I despise more.
[chuckling] Thomas Je--
Thomas Jefferson…
Thomas Jefferson was full of shit.
He was someone who was very well aware of the atrocities that existed in slavery.
He was someone who was very well aware of the atrocities that existed in slavery. He wasn't willing to let go of that divide because of what slavery did for…
He wasn't willing to let go of that divide because of what slavery did for…
for him.
[Kendi] On the one hand, he opposed slavery.
But then on the other hand, he opposed abolition.
And so he would speak out against slavery, particularly earlier in his career.
He'd also speak out against people trying to bring the end of slavery!
[Anderson] That's the paradox that sits right at the core of America.
You say freedom, but you're an enslaver.
You see, I must write the Declaration of Independence.
[Vanee] As kids, we're taught to love Thomas Jefferson,
because of all he did for this country, but he's a villain to somebody.
Mr. Jefferson…
[Vanee] When we only talk about one side of it,
that villainhood is erased…
So Thomas Jefferson is still highly romanticized.
[Jefferson] What's the matter?
Master, I'm scared.
Of what?
[Jefferson] Interracial mixing is a degradation to which no lover of his country,
is a degradation to which no lover of his country,
no lover of excellence of the human character,
can innocently consent.
To this, I have a great aversion.
Thomas Jefferson spoke so poorly on Black women,
talking about how unattractive they were.
I think at one point he likened them to orangutans.
But he couldn't get enough of Sally Hemings.
How many children did he have by that woman?
He consistently…
raped
Sally Hemings, who was a teenage slave.
That's Thomas Jefferson.
Espousing the language of democracy,
while he is breeding
property for Monticello.
[Dr. Stephanie Jones-Rogers] These white men, like Jefferson,
rationalized sexual violence perpetrated against Black women
by saying that it wasn't sexual violence at all.
[Roberts] One of the most powerful myths about Black women
that came out of the slavery era,
was the icon of the Black Jezebel.
This was supposed to be a Black woman
who was completely controlled by her sexual appetites.
She was innately predisposed to always be hypersexual,
and want to engage with sex.
[Dr. Racquel Gates] If you take that as fact, who does it let off the hook?
What types of experiences does it allow us to overlook or to ignore?
[Roberts] This was an excuse for white men's rape of enslaved women.
[Jones-Rogers] By constructing Black women as promiscuous, they can say,
"Well, they wanted it."
"Well, they came on to me, they seduced me."
♪ I see sinners in a church Sometimes I might be introvert ♪ [Gates] That is a trope in American popular culture,

[woman] If you feel you've been harassed, you cannot send mixed signals

We have to understand that sexual violence was fundamental to violence of slavery.
The culture of slavery was a violent one.
And sexual violence was a part of that culture.
[Jackson] There is no consent, there's no ability to say no.
You are considered unrapeable in slavery, legally considered unrapeable.
[Vanee] There were so many different ways Black women were violated
that makes their experience as enslaved people different,
and makes the scholarship surrounding their struggles different.
[Kendi] White enslavers tried to cover up their sexual assaults of Black women,
but one woman refused to let her voice be silenced.
[Jackson] Harriet Jacobs was the first woman
to ever write her own slave narrative.
And she writes it in a way
in which she describes what Black enslaved mothers went through.
[Harriet Jacobs] Reader,
I draw no imaginary pictures of Southern homes.
Slavery is terrible for men, but it is far more terrible for women.
Women have wrongs and sufferings and mortifications peculiarly their own.
[Jacobs] My master met me at every turn, reminding me that I belong to him
and swearing by Heaven and Earth that he could compel me to submit to him.
[Jacobs] He'd people my young mind with unclean images,
such as only a vile monster could think of.
[whispering] Do as I say.
[Jacobs] I saw a man 40 years my senior
daily violating the most sacred commandments of nature.
[Jacobs] He told me I was his property.
That I must be subject to his will in all things.
My soul revolted against the mean tyranny.
But where could I turn for protection?
[Jacobs] They would hide me in Snaky Swamp
till my Uncle Phillip had prepared a place of concealment for me.
I was about to risk everything on the throw of a die.
And if I failed,
what would become of me and my poor children?
A place of concealment had been provided for me at my grandmother's.
A small shed never occupied by anything but rats and mice.
[Jacobs] I suffered for air even more than for light.
But I was not comfortless.
I heard the voices of my children.
There was joy,
and there was sadness in the sound.
It made my tears flow.
I lived in that little dismal hole for nearly seven years.
Reader, my story ends with freedom.
[Jacobs] I have not written my experiences in order to attract attention to myself.
It would have been more pleasant to me to have been silent about my own history,
It would have been more pleasant to me to have been silent about my own history, but I want to add my testimony.
I do earnestly desire to arouse the women of the North
to the condition of two million women at the South,
still in bondage,
suffering what I suffered.
And most of them far worse.
I want to convince the people of the free states
what slavery really is.
[Jackson] The dominant slave narratives in the United States
was one that did not include women.
Harriet Jacobs is the first, and I don't think that you have
a wave of Black women telling their stories as enslaved women
without Harriet Jacobs opening up that door
without Harriet Jacobs opening up that door and allowing for some of those conversations,
particularly those hard, difficult conversations, to take place.
[Morgan] Jacobs telling her story is really important,
because if she didn't tell her story,
we wouldn't understand the way sexual predation was built in
we wouldn't understand the way sexual predation was built in to this system that was allegedly about work.
to this system that was allegedly about work.
And ironically, historians, they assumed it was written by a white woman,
by an abolitionist, because they felt like it was too…
[sighs] …dramatic, the story of her life, that it couldn't have been real.
Women like Harriet Jacobs,
they know that the archive is trying to eliminate them.
They know that their stories are not supposed to be told.
So when they tell their story,
it is crucial that we pay attention to it.
[woman 1] The creation of a hostile environment,
with or without physical contact, is sexual harassment.
[woman 2] I can't even explain how I felt, even now.
There's no way of telling
whether I would have even been able to be sitting here now,
telling you what happened.
[Porsha Olayiwola] At any given time, and in any given space,
I, as a Black woman, can suffer from racism, sexism, homophobia, classism!
can suffer from racism, sexism, homophobia, classism! I can be raped, beat, be burned alive,
I can be raped, beat, be burned alive, and no one, not a single soul,
will look up to acknowledge my absence from this universe
because I am insignificant, because I am a Black woman!
[rapping] Try being a lady? You mean you want me To act catty and shady
Play with me like a doll Degrade me, trade me
Use me as your trophy So that you can parade me

[Tarana Burke] What started as a simple exchange of empathy between survivors,
has now become a rallying cry.
They were simply trying to be heard and trying to be seen and believed.
[Anita Hill] We deserve better systems, we deserve better attention,
we deserve leadership that will call out and acknowledge this problem.
I stand here
as a survivor of sexual and domestic violence.
[Morgan] Harriet Jacobs, ultimately,
her freedom was purchased for her.
And Harriet Jacobs is really angered
that she has to be given her freedom
through the intervention of white abolitionists.
[Jackson] Most of the time, when I talk about abolitionists in my classroom,
they think of kind, white people that made this great sacrifice
and they're not completely wrong.
But when I think of the abolitionists, I think of Black men and Black women that were courageous
I think of Black men and Black women that were courageous and did incredible things.
I think of them as the center of the movement,
and really white allyship and white abolitionists as the periphery.
Unfortunately, people aren't going to listen to minorities
until they have a majority figure speak for them or alongside them.
So we needed white abolitionists.
However, it didn't stop them from being problematic.
[Vanee] There were white abolitionists who were in this school of thought where,
"Yes, slavery is morally wrong,
but I also don't feel like Black people are equal to me."
[Lincoln] Even when you cease to be slaves,
you're yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race.
Whether this is right or wrong,
I need not discuss.
We have this idea of Lincoln as the great emancipator.
-[announcer] Abraham Lincoln! -[crowd cheering]
[Jackson] Because he abolished the institution of slavery,
people hold him in very high regard.
[Chris Berman] Two African-American quarterbacks starting against each other in the Superbowl for the first time.
Fittingly, February 12th is Abe Lincoln's birthday.
[Jackson] But if you were to have a conversation with Lincoln in the 19th century,
you would probably be like, "This dude is low-key racist."
[Lincoln] I, as much as any other man, am in favor of having the superior position
am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race.
[Vanee] He is painted often as a figure
who saw the moral wrongs of slavery, but let's be clear.
He was just anti-slavery because of how he felt the economy could benefit
because of how he felt the economy could benefit from moving away from slavery.
[Jones-Rogers] We need to look at all of what he said,
not just what he said in the Emancipation Proclamation.
If we do that, then we realize that Abraham Lincoln is a perplexing character,
and especially in the history of Black people in America.
Look, I'm half Abraham Lincoln, so…
So, I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?
Well, no, but, eh…
Most of history has centered white men, very much so,
and has made them sort of like the great white hope.
They are the deliverer or the emancipator.
It's problematic because it robs Black people of their agency,
it robs them of all the contributions that they gave to the movement.

[Jackson] Black abolitionists are the first abolitionists.
No one needed to tell enslaved people, "You know what, slavery is wrong."
"You know, this is bad for you." [laughs] They knew that.
They knew that, and they're the first to speak out about their grievances
and about, you know, the evils of this institution.
And I think it's important to show that, like, Black people freed themselves.
But the white savior trope
allows white people to imagine Black people as children,
and to say, "We're uplifting you." "We're developing you as any parent would a child."
"We're developing you as any parent would a child."
But Black people are like, "We ain't children."
"We don't need you to lead us."
"We need you to support us, we need you to ally with us."
If your goal to help under-serviced, impoverished, Black communities
come from your own personal research,
and there's not a Black voice anywhere around you,
you need to check your inventory.
[Jackson] That's why it's so important for Lincoln to have people like Frederick Douglass and Elizabeth Keckley,
to have people like Frederick Douglass and Elizabeth Keckley, and other Black people around him,
that give him an alternative vision of what Black people are capable of
and what freedom needs to look like for them.
[Kendi] Lincoln initially stated very clearly,
"This is not a war of abolition, this is a war to restore the union."
And because he issued the Emancipation Proclamation,
about 200,000 Black men
joined the Union Army during the last two years of the war
to fight what now became a war of freedom.

[Vanee] Black progress is so terrifying
to white Americans, that they will do anything

By connecting that idea of protecting the women in your community,
to this alleged threat of Blackness,
you transform racist violence into virtue.
And when you do that,
it justifies all kinds of horrific actions.
[Kendi] In the early 1890s,
lynchings were at their height,
and the justifications for why so many Black people were being lynched,
was because of what those Black people did wrong.
[Cunningham] It was not just about the person who was hanging on the tree
who was being punished for whatever crime, usually invented,
that they often did not do.
The act of lynching was also there to inflict terror,
lest any of us want to be hanging from a tree too.
That we were to all be able to look at that image and understand
that we should never cross the line and that we should stay in our place.
Get on the ground! Get on the ground!
[officer] What's wrong with you?
White supremacist powers created those stereotypes
as a way to put fear in people.
[Bush] If you make us the threat, then you remove our humanity.
These are intentional choices to hold us back.
♪ Your life, would you risk that? These kids never been bad ♪
[Roberts] The criminalization of Black people
has been an essential part of white supremacy in America.
It is a very powerful way
for white people to explain why it's important for a white power elite
for white people to explain why it's important for a white power elite to control and contain Black communities.
[Sabonjian] These guys have been in and out of trouble so much you'd fill a book,
but unfortunately we have to handle these characters like daffodils,
instead of the bums that they are,
where we could throw them in a jail where they belong.
[chanting] Black lives matter!
[Rudy Giuliani] Why aren't they classified as a terrorist group?
Just because they're Black and nobody can say it?
Stop the nonsense. These are killers, people who hate white people.
Those ideas about "crime" and "Black" and "race,"
become ingrained in the American imagination.
Everybody that lives with the colored has to move.
[interviewer] Why?
Because you're not safe walking the streets at night.
You cannot leave the house.
When we think about how criminals are represented in the media,
they tend to be people of color and specifically Black men.
[man] Horton broke into our home.
For 12 hours, I was beaten, slashed and terrorized.
He was serving a life term without the possibility of a parole
when Governor Dukakis gave him a few days off.
[Dylann Roof] Black people are killing white people every day.
They rape white women-- 100 white women a day.
♪ He say it's a long story ♪ ♪ Just know these youths Want a gunman ♪
[Reagan] You're familiar enough with the statistics.
[Reagan] Crime is an American epidemic.
From these statistics, a portrait emerges.
The portrait is that of a stark, staring face.
A face that belongs to a frightening reality of our time.
The face of a human predator. The face of the habitual criminal.
Nothing in nature is more cruel and more dangerous.
There are ways to criminalize people without it being in their face.
[Hillary Clinton] They are not just gangs of kids anymore.
They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators.
No conscience, no empathy.
First we have to join together to ensure the drug dealers are punished swiftly, surely and severely.
to ensure the drug dealers are punished swiftly, surely and severely.
Crime becomes a code word
for Black, for race.
[Cunningham] The invention of Black criminality
is by such intentional design,
that it pervades all of culture.
Teenage killers the homicide rate for juveniles
now has surpassed the rate for adults in this country…
[reporter] Kids that once stole hubcaps now rape and murder.
[Jackson] Racist ideas get reinforced over and over again
by what we see on TV, what we see on the news.
Commercials, film, social media, you name it.
And a lot of those ideas are silent. They're sort of subtle because they're cloaked in, you know,
They're sort of subtle because they're cloaked in, you know, fancy dressing and disguise.
[Gates] By the time that we start to get to like the 1930s,
it is sort of socially unacceptable to just, you know, like be lynching Black folks on camera, right?
like be lynching Black folks on camera, right?
But what we get is still the invocation of aspects of Blackness
even when you don't have Black characters present.
[Gates] In cinema, you're not bound in reality.
You can make the villain as big and black,
and powerful and horrible as you want them to be.
Shut up, you freak!
Julius, you--
I said shut up!
[Gates] The reason that it works,
the reason that it's legible to us as audiences,
is because we've already been trained in stereotypes about Blackness
that we may not even realize that we are bringing in our viewing practices.
[officer] You need to disperse immediately!
[reporter] Two things happened here last night.
One was the protest for that slain teenager,
the second was lawlessness on fire and out of control.
North of St. Louis, thieves ruled the night.
[chanting] Hands up, don't shoot! Hands up, don't shoot!
Black people are no more violent or dangerous
than any other group of people.
But we are taught the face of violence is Black,
causing us to overlook the white individuals
who engage in violence,
because apparently, they don't have the face of violence.
He doesn't look like the type to kill somebody.
[Kendi] Widespread poverty and access to guns
better explain violence than race.
But we are taught that white violence is self-defense.
Deadly chokehold in the subway.
[reporter] Neely, a former Michael Jackson impersonator
had been acting erratically and shouting at passengers
but didn't physically harm anyone onboard.
[reporter 2] Lawyers for Penny say he acted in self-defense.
A Florida woman accused of shooting and killing her neighbor.
Police say she fired a gun through the front door of her home,
killing Ajike Owens, a mother of four.
Lorincz claims that she was acting in self-defense.
There is an African-American man. I am in Central Park.
He is recording me, and threatened myself and my dog.
I'm being threatened by a man in the Ramble!
Please send the cops immediately.
[Sean Noffke] Sanford police department. Line's being recorded, this is Sean.
[G. Zimmerman] We've had some break-ins in my neighborhood
and there's a real suspicious guy.
[Noffke] Okay, and this guy, is he white, Black or Hispanic?
[Zimmerman] He looks Black.
The potential violence that comes from propagating these ideas,
the potential violence is extraordinary.
They talked about George Floyd as under the influence,
and thus at any moment could potentially become a beast.
Ahmaud Arbery is running.
And merely running,
he becomes bestial in the minds of these white men.
These so-called innocuous ideas,
they have this power to infect the minds of people,
who then use them and twist them
to justify the massacre of Black people.
[Benjamin] If we want to be fancy, we could call it "cultural narratives."
I call it just straight-up lies that people tell themselves
in order to justify the maintenance of these policies and these inequalities.
Lynching was a reaction, a racist reaction,
Lynching was a reaction, a racist reaction, to Black folks doing well.
to Black folks doing well.
Ida B. Wells looked at the stories,
and the data that was being produced to justify lynching and said,
"No, I'm gonna collect my own data."
[Wells] If the Southern people, in defense of their lawlessness,
would tell the truth about lynching,
there would not be now the necessity for this defense.
But when they intentionally, maliciously, and constantly belie the record,
then the Negro must give to the world his side of the awful story.
[Wells] Everybody in town knew my friend Tommy.
He owned a little home and having saved his money,
he went into the grocery business.
One day, some colored and white boys quarreled over a game of marbles.
Of course, the colored grocery keepers have been drawn into the dispute.
[Wells] Sunday morning's paper came out
with lurid headlines about the grocery store.
The newspaper fanned the flames of racial prejudice,
calling the grocery store a resort of thieves and thugs.
-[man] Get him! -[grunting]
[Wells, voice breaking] A finer, cleaner man than he, never walked the streets of Memphis,
yet he was murdered with no more consideration
than if he had been a dog.
This is what opened my eyes to what lynching really was,
an excuse to get rid of Negroes who were acquiring wealth and property
and thus, keep the race terrorized.
[Wells] The more I studied the situation, the more I was convinced
that the Southerner had never gotten over his resentment
that the Negro was no longer his plaything, his servant,
that the Negro was no longer his plaything, his servant, and his source of income.
[Wells] During these years, more than 10 thousand Negroes
have been killed in cold blood,
without the formality of judicial trial and legal execution.
The same record shows that during all these years,
and for all these murders,
only three white men have been tried, convicted and executed.
[Wells] The very frequent inquiry made after my lectures
by interested friends is,
"What can I do to help the cause?"
The answer always is,
"Tell the world the facts."
When it comes to telling our stories,
and forcing this country to take an unflinching look at itself,
she is the originator.
We can see those postcards of lynch mobs,
We can see those postcards of lynch mobs, and their wives and children
standing underneath a Black body swinging from a tree,
and know that it's horrifying.
But we can only do that,
because Ida B. Wells took it upon herself, in the day and time when it was happening,
to make sure that we knew,
to make sure that we could not look away.
[woman] You just opened my car door,
so you're threatening to drag me out of my own car.
Get out of the car!
-[woman] You gonna stun me? -I'll light you up. Get out!
-Get down, stay! On your face! -[screaming]
-One, two… -I am no threat to this officer.
I've been threatened.
-Watch the show, folks. -My life is in danger! My life…
For what? Every time you see me, you wanna mess with me.
I'm tired of it! This stops today.
[bystander] He's not responsive right now, bro.
Does he have a pulse?
No, bro! Look at him, he's not responsive right now, bro.
-Check for a pulse. -Bro, are you serious?
You gonna let him sit here with that on his neck?
[Cunningham] Police violence is modern day lynching.
State violence against Black bodies, inside and outside of prison cells,
is lynching.
It is a form of racial terror,
meant not only to punish the Black individual,
but to send a message to all Black people, to stay in our place.
Even as policing and their techniques have evolved,
there is a single common thread.
[Cooper] Every time there's a huge, fan out, push forward, go…
…there's a tidal wave back.
A wall of white supremacy that shows up and says, like,
"This far and no farther."
-[indistinct clamoring] -Back up!
[Perry] The response to Black progress
is punishment.
[Perry] It's not articulated like that.
It's articulated as problems of crime, problems of drugs.
But the reality is, it's an effort to reassert racial domination through "order."
it's an effort to reassert racial domination through "order."
This nation must make an all-out effort to combat crime.
Our country's laws must be respected.
Order must be maintained.
[Nixon] My friends, let this message come through clear from what I say tonight.
The wave of crime is not going to be the wave of the future
in the United States of America.
The first responsibility of government
is law and order.
I am the law and order candidate.
[Mike Wallace] When you read stories about difficulties,
riots in Omaha, or Cleveland, or Brooklyn, or Chicago, or wherever…
I call them rebellions.
-[Wallace] They're rebellions? -Right.
[Wallace] And you-- you see nothing wrong with them?
I think that it is people who are rebelling against a system
that has locked them inside, tight, of ghettos,
that exploits and oppresses them,
and they have no means of redress to break that system down.
You have moved to destroy and disrupt,
you have taken people away,
you have broken down their systems,
and you have called all that, "civilization."
And we who have suffered at this, are now saying to you,
And we who have suffered at this, are now saying to you, "You are the killers of the dreams."
"You are the savages."
"Yes, it is you who have always been uncivilized."
Civilize yourself.
[Anderson] This nation is drawn to the spectacular.
Drawn to the flames.
But we don't pay attention to the kindling,
and the kindling are those policies that are predicated on anti-Blackness.
The denial of education, kindling.
Unequal housing and employment opportunities, kindling.
The hyper-policing of Black communities, kindling.
[Vanee] Stop-and-frisk…
[officer] Police, freeze!
[Benjamin] The war on drugs.
[Jeffers] Mass incarceration.
[Cunningham] When you have policies, structures, and institutions
that intentionally subjugate Black people,
you intentionally create communities that can be continuously criminalized.
And there's that thread again.
[Kendi] When we think of the history of racism in this country,
we're really thinking of the history of power.
[Bush] Everything in our society that has been used to oppress Black people in this country,
that has been used to oppress Black people in this country, it's so they can continue to keep power.
it's so they can continue to keep power.
The white elite.
That's how they benefit.
They get to maintain their power.
[Cunningham] We are taught that power is some kind of finite resource,
that it is a pie.
The more I have, the less you have. The more you have, the less I have.
If your guiding principle is that, whatever you have, keep it at all costs, then you will do whatever you have to do.
whatever you have, keep it at all costs, then you will do whatever you have to do.
You will lie, you will cheat, you will steal, you will kill, to make sure you hold on to it.
[Dr. Angela Davis] The work that ought to have been done
in the immediate aftermath of slavery,
the work of reorganizing, retooling,
reconceptualizing the entire society,
so that it might be possible for previously enslaved individuals
to be free and equal,
that work was never done.
[man] Watch out, watch out, watch out!
[Jones-Rogers] I think that white people are afraid of what will happen
if they put a mirror up to themselves.
They'll be able to see that for generations, for centuries,
they have tormented and repressed Black, brown and tan people.
They might not know what to do with that history.
There will be a "Then what?" question.
"Now that you know, then what?"
They'll have to think about whether they want to continue
to live in that legacy.
[Kendi] The heartbeat of being racist is denial,
is constantly looking for ways to deny the persistence of racism.
In order to address the way in which racism is-- is baked in,
actually requires an active disposition.
And that is anti-racism.
[Kendi] People are constantly thinking about, if we create an anti-racist society,
what are they going to lose,
as opposed to what they're going to gain.
[Perry] If you want an effective social network of human beings, an effective society,
keeping your heel on the back of a portion of the community,
is probably not the best move.
[Jones-Rogers] I don't know what it'll look like, but I know it's possible
because someone, some series of people, put the system together in the first place.
And if they can put the system together in the first place,
then we can undo the system.
[Cooper] It isn't about a better idea that allows you to love your neighbor. That's not what we're talking about.
That's not what we're talking about.
If all "anti-racist" means,
is that you personally don't dislike people of color,
how does that make my life any better because you personally don't dislike me?
But if, after you have reckoned with that, you then go out and say,
"But how has our structural dislike of these people, our structural disregard of these people,
our structural disregard of these people,
made it harder for them to actually live?"
Then, now we're talking. Now we're cooking with grease.
[Jackson] Black people know what they want.
They have ideas about what freedom and liberation will look like.
And it doesn't look like this radical utopia.
It looks a lot like the world that white people live in.
[chuckling] The world that white people living in never question.
I love being Black.
I thank God every day that He made me Black.
I love my Black husband.
I love the Black baby we're gonna have.
I love my Black family. I love my Black neighbor, Miss Janet.
I love my Black church.
I love my Black music.
I love all of the things that Blackness has given America,
whether or not America acknowledges it.
[Williams] So tell me, what is wrong with Black people?
Nothing. Nothing is wrong with Black people.
There is nothing wrong with Black people.
You see how absolutely absurd it is.
