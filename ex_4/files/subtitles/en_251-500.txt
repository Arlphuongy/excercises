Well, aren't you the recruiting poster.
Résumés don't mean a lot to me...
...and they mean absolutely nothing on the street.
Any other supportive advice before we get to know each other?
As a matter of fact, there is. If you want a career here in PID...
...you might want to invest in some more appropriate clothing.
I was ordered to take you on. That's why I'm here.
You requested me as a TA. Why?
My field instructor at the Academy said you're the best investigator we have.
-Who was that? -Pete Garrison.
Right.

-Come on, what--? -Take your hands out of the jacket.
-We're clear. -All right, Classic's coming out.
I think we should hold hands.
Fine.
All posts, from Chilton Security, they're coming out.

Nice to meet you.

How do you think it went in there?
-Excuse me, ma'am, you talking to me? -Yes.
I thought it was an excellent speech.
-One to 10. -Ten, ma'am.
You're not a very good liar, Pete.
-Seriously? -Yes. I really wanna know.
Nine-point-five.
Excuse me.
Charlie?
Charlie. Charlie. Oh, Charlie. Somebody! Help!
Oh, Charlie. Somebody! Help! Charlie, Charlie. Somebody help!
You're killing our country.
I know what's going on. I hate you.
I saw you on the news. I got your message.
-I know you want me to kill you. -Excuse me.
-I know you want me to kill you. -Excuse me. Sorry.
-So all of these are from last week? -That's about half of them.
And then... -...there are the verbal threats. -He's a dead man.
-...there are the verbal threats. -He's a dead man.
I'm gonna kill him and his whole family. He's ruining this country...
I'm gonna kill him and his whole family. He's ruining this country... -...and I'm gonna gut him.... -They sound worse in English.
-...and I'm gonna gut him.... -They sound worse in English. Yeah. I got this guy yesterday.
Yeah. I got this guy yesterday. -Did you translate this? -No.
-Did you translate this? -No. -Whoever did is not a native speaker. -How do you know that?
-Whoever did is not a native speaker. -How do you know that?
What he translated here:
And that literally means to put pressure on him, he bit the guy...
...as if he was being tortured. But that's not what it means.
It's slang. It means he bribed him. He didn't bite him.
Good.
We need to talk.
I think you have a little spinach or something in your teeth.
I want you to route all calls through to my cell.
Picked a hell of a day to start your fieldwork. Button up your jacket.
Picked a hell of a day to start your fieldwork. Button up your jacket. Why? What's going on?
Here comes the Secret Service.
I really don't need them breathing down my neck.
What the hell do they know about investigating murder?
She can breathe down my neck but not him.

-You guys bring lunch? -Not today.
The way I see it, he hands over the wallet.
As the guy reaches forward, Merriweather goes for his gun... ...bad guy shoots him first.
...bad guy shoots him first.
-You think this is a street crime? -In my gut, yeah.
You know my problem with gut feelings?
Once you have them, the only evidence you see...
...is the evidence that reinforces your gut feeling.
-Human nature. -There's no money left in his wallet...
...and there's been a series of robberies here.
You have reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years...
...honing his ability to sense danger. He'd notice anything out of the ordinary.
So for some street criminal to get the drop on him...
...yeah, it raises some questions.
Not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a .45.
I'm taking a guess here, but from your initial canvassing...
I'm taking a guess here, but from your initial canvassing... ...I bet no one heard anything.
Any homicide cop will tell you that sort of thing happens all the time.
I bet they would, detective.
-Rosario. -Hello, Miss Sarah.
-Anyone want anything to eat, drink? -No, thanks, ma'am. I think we're fine.
Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, sweep downstairs then go for dinner.
I'll sweep upstairs, sit post until the shift change.
-You've been on as long as me. -You gonna make me change my mind?
Detective, if you take a look at the bullet mark on the door jamb...
...you'll see the slug didn't penetrate. It's cedar, a soft wood.
...you'll see the slug didn't penetrate. It's cedar, a soft wood. -It gets brittle with age. -So, what are you saying?
-It gets brittle with age. -So, what are you saying? Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it. That's what slowed down the bullet...
...and stopped it from penetrating the wood...
...which it easily would have done...
...had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
Shooter was standing right here. One other thing, detective.
Excuse me. Agent Merriweather's firearm. Safety's still on.
We assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
Agent Marin, why don't you explain to the detectives why that is unlikely.
If he was a police officer, it would make sense.
You're trained to draw your weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions...
...to avoid accidental shootings.
Our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
If he drew his weapon, his safety would be off.
A protective agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
When we draw our weapon, we intend to use it.
Bottom line, Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon. I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.
If this man was one of yours...
...you would've treated him with a lot more respect.
Let's get a gurney up here!
It always amazes me how thorough you are.
Well, we try to do the best job we can. Hopefully, you sleep better at night.
-And I definitely do. -Garrison, DiPaola.
-And I definitely do. -Garrison, DiPaola. -We're good on the perimeter, 10-60. -Roger, 10-60.
-We're good on the perimeter, 10-60. -Roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early, so he can...
...get something to eat.
-Hi. -Hi.
-I miss you. -Oh, God.
I love you, Sarah.
Garrison, DiPaola, where are you?
-Garrison, DiPaola, where are you? -Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi. So, what the hell is going on here? Aziz, what are you doing here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
He--? He was murdered?
PID thinks it might be connected to work. Director put us on alert.
I'm sorry, I know he was your friend.
Was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
Was he agitated or worried about anything?
He was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
Did he tell you why?
Said he had a couple of tough days at work.
What did he say at breakfast?
Some gossip, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for you...
...but I need a complete picture if I'm going to investigate this properly.
He thought Pete Garrison was having an affair...
...with someone's wife at work. Just gossip, it's just--
...with someone's wife at work. Just gossip, it's just-- -Yeah. -Probably not even true.
-Yeah. -Probably not even true.
That's all we need for now.
You got the lead on Charlie's murder? -Screw you. -What?
Screw you.
-You still got a problem with me? -Take your hands off of me.
Christ, doesn't matter what I say to you.
I don't care if you got a problem with me...
...but you show respect when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
If you have any information, that I want to hear. Otherwise, stay away.
If you have any information, that I want to hear. Otherwise, stay away. You're a piece of work.
You know, Nancy did say one thing...
...Charlie was upset about something at work. Do you know what that might be?
-No. -If you figure it out... -...you know where to find me. -I'll send you a memo.
-...you know where to find me. -I'll send you a memo.
-Do that. -Hey. Is everything okay? Hey, Jill, yeah.
-You working with him now? -Yeah.
You may learn a lot, but don't listen to everything he says.
-Especially about me. -Okay.
Pete.
There some problem between you two?
-I thought you were friends. -We were.
So, what happened? It's personal, let's go.
It's personal, let's go.
-No, you know what, he can go to hell. -Just tell him it wasn't me.
-No, you know what, he can go to hell. -Just tell him it wasn't me. -Tell him again it-- -It wasn't anybody.
-Tell him again it-- -It wasn't anybody.
-I'm not saying it was. -I wasn't having an affair. -Cindy, I know you weren't. -What do you want me to tell him?
-Cindy, I know you weren't. -What do you want me to tell him?
This is why I left him, he's the most pig-headed man I ever met.
You still love him, don't you?
-Hey, Pete, Pete. -Hey, Tom.
You know a guy named Walter Xavier?
He's a snitch I used when I was working in counterfeit.
He's a snitch I used when I was working in counterfeit. I just fielded a call with him. I said you weren't running informants anymore...
I just fielded a call with him. I said you weren't running informants anymore...
...offered to transfer the call to WFO, PID...
...he said you were the only person he'd talk to.
Thanks.
Hey, Publishers Clearing House, my man. You got something for me?
You fill yours out yet?
Every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out. I never do.
-Long time no see, Walter. What's up? -Let's walk.
You got info on that Charlie Merriweather murder?
-Is that that agent killed on Monday? -Yeah.
Maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to like I did.
-What was that something? -A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
Not if you got somebody inside.
Are you saying there's a mole in the Secret Service?
That's right. There's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president?
There's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president? -That's right. -Well, what's his name?
-That's right. -Well, what's his name? I don't know, I just know he exists.
Well, how? Who's giving you the information?
-I want $1 million. -What are you smoking? Be serious.
-I want $1 million. -What are you smoking? Be serious. I'm dead serious.
You roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
-They'll hunt me down. -Protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
You got a traitor in your organization.
Get me the money and I'll disappear.
I find it pretty far-fetched that we got agents in on an assassination attempt.
Here, maybe this will change your mind, okay?
Call signs, code words, today's encryption keys.
The traitor is either in the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
Listen, I want a list of everyone who's got Q clearance.
And where's the president right now?
Press conference at his house, 20 minutes.
This morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve...
...to take on terrorism wherever we find it, anywhere around....
How reliable is this guy, Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
My guess, mid-level guy, Barranquilla Cartel.
Sir, that's everyone with Q cards.
Polygraph everyone on that list. And stand up a red team to find the traitor.
I'm going to assume that the hit on Merriweather is connected to this.
Fold that investigation in as well.
We put Breckinridge in charge.
-You think he's the best? -Yeah.
Pete? He's kind of a protégé of yours, what do you think?
He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
Then he's the guy.
You can have anybody you want, from ID, from the field.
You can have anybody you want, from ID, from the field. You get carte blanche.
-Not right now. -Sorry.
-I told personnel you can lose the rookie. -No, I'm going to keep her.
She hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
I will throw a bomb. I come to bomb this country.
I will use holy bomb.
We have intel that al Qaeda...
...have met at least twice with the Barranquilla leadership.
You think it's time to coincide with the Camp David talks?
Probably. The threat alone interferes with the process.
We pulled 50 agents. These are people who haven't worked...
...at the White House in two cycles. We'll integrate with your teams.
We'll be looking over each other's shoulders until we find this guy, sir.
Well, do what you have to to protect me...
...but I want the threat, investigation, I want everything, kept classified.
As far as the public is concerned, I'm carrying on my normal business.
Is that clear?
Mr. President, we'll need everyone involved.
What do you think would happen to the power of the president...
...if people thought I wasn't safe from my Secret Service?
It took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency...
...and I'm not going to undermine it with something like this.
Let's circle the wagons, okay?
-You all right? -Fine.
Good, let's do that. Proceed.
Bill, you're the guy.
You're the last line of defense.
You can protect him better than any of us can.
Is there anything else you can think of that will help you do that?
Yeah...
...this:
We're going to win this one.
Thank you very much. Good night.
Heads it's 6th Street, tails it's 8th.
Bravo cars.
Classic is moving the bravo cars.
Copy that. Planned alpha cars, you're off the hook.
Could you put down that knife?
It's not what they wanted to hear, but it's what they needed to hear.
Where did this guy come from?
He's an old CI of Garrison's, Nine or 10 years.
Garrison?
What's wrong?
-It's nothing. -Are you sure?
-Yes, it's okay. -How do I find Xavier?
-Yes, it's okay. -How do I find Xavier? I don't know, he's a fanatic about not being followed.
I don't know, he's a fanatic about not being followed.
You ever tried?
-What? -Have you ever tried?
He wants a million bucks, Dave, I'm sure he'll contact us.
You better be right.
You get in touch with us as soon as you find him.
Could be any one of them. Makes you a little sick, doesn't it?
What percentage of your people have had a polygraph?
Little over half.
Over half? The president's life is at stake.
Heads up.
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5 p.m...
...or don't show up for work tomorrow.
Were you born in Morocco? No.
-Do you live in Bethesda? -No.

The same agent plotting to kill John? Who?
A hundred and forty-one years... ...there's never been a traitor in the Secret Service.
Now, all of a sudden, there's two? I don't buy that.
-Somehow they're connected. -Maybe this is the assassination.
This is a death sentence for John. A political death sentence.
That's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Sarah. I promise.
Let's get this witch-hunt over with.
-Just relax. -I'm relaxed.

Are you involved in a plot to kill the president of the United States?
-No. -No.
I could use a few of those.
-Thanks. -You look exhausted, Bill.
You look worse.
Haven't slept since we went on alert.
Well, I'm back on. It's worse than going to confession.
Have you done your polygraph yet?
-I can't let you back on duty unless-- -Yeah, no, I'll go now.
-Is your name Peter Garrison? -Yes.
Are you involved in a plot... -...to kill the president? -No.

Inside my detail?
Now, Bill's been briefing me, of course, but this guy's your informant, right?
-Yes, sir. -I want to get some of this firsthand.
So let's make time at Camp David to do that, all right?
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

Unholster your weapon. Keep it down.
Copy that. Stagger off 10 feet.
Get out of here!
Take the point.
I don't have a visual.
Go!
Garrison, additional agents and medical assist are en route.
Garrison, additional agents and medical assist are en route. Break. All units, all units, be advised, shots fired at Allenwood Mall.
Break. All units, all units, be advised, shots fired at Allenwood Mall.
One agent is down. There are multiple casualties.
Shooter is male. Blonde hair, dark jacket.
Pete. Pete!
You okay?
Any idea why your informant wanted you killed?
No, I'm wondering the same thing.
You might wanna figure that one out, Pete.
Pete.
Presidential helicopter just went down.
This is a NewsCenter special report.
The presidential helicopter, Marine One, has crashed in a wooded area.
The presidential helicopter has gone down.
Local police and emergency crews are now arriving at the crash site.
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has crashed.
It happened just moments ago a half mile south of Camp David.
The chopper went down in densely wooded....
I'm told we can confirm that neither the president or the first lady...
...were onboard at the time of the crash.
The president and first lady are safe.
If you're just joining us, these are pictures... ...just outside Camp David....
-Flip it off. -Screw this.
That leads to the possibility unconfirmed by authorities....
Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
We want to make clear, the president and first lady are safe.
If you are just joining us, these are live pictures just outside Camp David...
...where earlier today, Marine One went down just after takeoff.
Reports are saying Marine and Secret Service personnel... ...were on the aircraft and were killed in the crash.
...were on the aircraft and were killed in the crash.
This crash is being investigated by the White House and the military....
-You failed. -I did exactly what I promised.
He wasn't onboard.
That is the only thing that matters. That is the only thing I give a shit--
Do you understand?
Now, we're gonna meet and we're gonna discuss this.
--deadly against any low-altitude aircrafts. Including jets, prop planes...
--deadly against any low-altitude aircrafts. Including jets, prop planes... ...and helicopters.
But that comes from witnesses. Has not been confirmed by investigators.
Again, these pictures coming to us about a half mile--
It doesn't look like you're here to bury the hatchet.
You're being investigated for treason.
-What are you talk--? -Step back.
-Excuse me? -Step back.
-Hey, Jill. -Pete.
-Matt. -Pete.
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
If I failed the polygraph, then why am I still on duty?
Director didn't wanna arrest the guy who saved Reagan's life...
Director didn't wanna arrest the guy who saved Reagan's life... ...without a little more evidence.
How long you worked for the Barranquilla cartel?
What are you talking about?
Hugo, can you come in here, please?
Pete Garrison, Special Agent Ortega with the FBI.
-What were you doing at Las Palmas? -I was having a cup of coffee.
Takes four hours to have coffee?
I was killing a few hours. Is there a problem with that?
Tom DiPaola called you four times. You never returned his messages.
And you almost missed the Marine One flight.
They moved the flight up. I was in the coffee shop.
It was noisy. I couldn't hear my phone. What is this, all right?
It was noisy. I couldn't hear my phone. What is this, all right? What the hell are you doing following me?
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop for the Barranquilla cartel.
You screwed up, Pete. You walked into a stakeout.
I wanna know your go-to guy at the cartel.
And I want to know how you were gonna help them kill the president.
Why would I wanna kill the president? -All right, what motive do--? -I don't know, Pete.
-All right, what motive do--? -I don't know, Pete. I know what the evidence is telling me.
I know what the evidence is telling me.
I've given my entire life to the Secret Service.
I've gotten up at 4 a.m. every goddamn morning.
So is that what this is about?
You're bitter that they didn't make you director?
Don't confuse your own ambition with mine, okay, Dave? Come on, think about it. People would understand that.
Come on, think about it. People would understand that.
I mean, Jesus Christ, you took a bullet for the president of the United States.
And in the 25 years since... ...you haven't even made shift supervisor on detail, and that I know you wanted.
...you haven't even made shift supervisor on detail, and that I know you wanted.
They don't put guys that bend the rules, not even a bit...
...in charge of PPD, do they?
Even if they did take a bullet for the old man.
Oh, is that your professional or personal opinion?
I think this whole thing is getting a little personal.
-I didn't have an affair with Cindy. -This has got nothing to do with her.
-I didn't have an affair with Cindy. -This has got nothing to do with her. -We aren't talking about that! -We're talking about it...
-We aren't talking about that! -We're talking about it... ...even when we're not.
You can't look at me without thinking about it!
-Jesus Christ, you better get a grip. -I got a grip.
-Jesus Christ, you better get a grip. -I got a grip. You think I wrecked your marriage, and it has clouded your judgment.
You think I wrecked your marriage, and it has clouded your judgment.
I am following the evidence and it is overwhelming.
The polygraph. Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
You have unfettered access to Marine One.
-It was hit by a missile! -It was hit by a missile...
-It was hit by a missile! -It was hit by a missile... ...because the flares and the four other countermeasures were disengaged.
...because the flares and the four other countermeasures were disengaged.
There were other people who had access to it.
Explain to me about the bank account.
-The what? -Your signature's all over the paperwork.
-I'm being framed. -Tell me that's not your signature.
-I'm being framed. -Tell me that's not your signature. Think about it! I'm the guy that initiated this investigation.
Think about it! I'm the guy that initiated this investigation.
Why would I do that?
You initiated this investigation for a traitor...
...so that when the assassination took place...
-...you'd be at the bottom of the list. -I'm being framed!
-...you'd be at the bottom of the list. -I'm being framed! All right, just think about it, all right? You take me in, that's the end.
All right, just think about it, all right? You take me in, that's the end. That guy is out there some--
The director just rolled up outside.
You better start thinking about cooperating.
He's in the car.
-What're you doing? -Getting a glass of water.
Director's come all the way down here to see me, huh?
That's very impressive. It's embarrassing for us, sir.
-Want a beer? -Look, Pete, we're really--
Garrison. Back door.
Oh, shit.
Pete! Pete!
Where is he?
Sorry.
This is Breckinridge. He has escaped from the residence into the alley.
Cordon off the area and get back to me.
-He got my radio. -He got my gun too.
He got your gun? And your radio?
What are you looking at her for? She's been here two days.
What are you looking at her for? She's been here two days. How long have you been here?
Where to, mister?
Just get me out of here.
I know it's hard for you to believe... ...that Pete Garrison could be involved with something like this.
...that Pete Garrison could be involved with something like this.
To most of you he's a friend. To some, a legend.
But the fact is the evidence against him is overwhelming.
So how do we find him? To begin with, know this. He is smarter...
To begin with, know this. He is smarter... ...and more experienced than all of you. You've never trained for this.
You are chasing your worst nightmare.
He knows how you think. He knows what you know. And he knows how you operate. And he will use that against you.
And he knows how you operate. And he will use that against you.
He also knows that it's gonna be very difficult for you...
...to pull the trigger if you have him in your sights. So I want you to take a second and visualize that.
So I want you to take a second and visualize that.
Because there is a very good chance that is exactly how this is going to end.
-Can I have one of these here? -Yeah, sure. Take it.
-Do you have arrival? -Backstop, Fullback, we have arrival.
Backstop....
Tom DiPaola to Command. Cincinnati wrapping up. We're alpha for departure.
I miss the good old days. Know what I mean?
I miss the good old days. Know what I mean? I mean, I really literally....
When the smoke cleared, he taps him on the back and the bear says:
"You didn't come here to hunt, did you?"
Get it? Bear.
That's not funny, man.
That joke ain't funny at all.
-Fullback, we're moving. -Roger that. We're set up.
Welke, DiPaola. -Cincinnati's coming to you. -Copy that.
-Cincinnati's coming to you. -Copy that.
Ma'am.
What are you doing here? I heard you were arrested.
Whatever you hear the next few days, I want you to know I was framed.
-I had to tell you to your face. -No, you don't. No, you don't.
-We're going to get out of this. -How?
I haven't figured that out yet. This is out of control. You've got to turn yourself in.
This is out of control. You've got to turn yourself in.
-No, no, no. -Yes, you do.
-I'll go to John. I'll tell him-- -I can't let you do that.
Pete, they think you're an assassin. They will kill you.
-You can cover my back. -How?
The director has got a daily password for the agents. Find out what it is.
Hey, guys. Garrison just used his cell phone.
He called Chez Doucette.
You turned around when it rang, didn't you?
Yeah. I did.
Ballsy. Very ballsy.
DiPaola said she seemed completely unfazed.
She came upstairs, waited and told him what happened.
Okay.
I'm trying to understand why he came here and why she reacted that way.
-This is your post? -Yeah, it is.
The first lady doesn't want to believe...
...the man protecting her for the last eight months...
...is trying to assassinate her husband.
That's why Pete came here.
He's looking for an ally.
And the first lady is a very powerful ally to have.
Great. The idea is to secure the entire site.
I want you to get every stolen-car report for the area.
Start looking for cars that were taken within walking distance...
Start looking for cars that were taken within walking distance... ...or any of the nearby metro stations.
Then within those parameters, isolate Accords, Tauruses...
Then within those parameters, isolate Accords, Tauruses... ...Camrys and Explorers.
How do you know what kind of car?
Those are the four most common vehicles in DC.
Pete knows that. He's gonna want to blend in.
And the first thing he's gonna want to do is find his informant.
If he tries to breach our computers, we can find where he's connecting.
He knows we would know that. He wouldn't do it.
He could connect to someone else. -How? -Well, you need that person's password.
-How? -Well, you need that person's password.
As a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard to get access to others' passwords.
Why would he do that? Why even risk it?
He was trapped. We have his credit cards, his cell phone.
He was trapped. We have his credit cards, his cell phone. He has no other place to hide.
-Can I help you? -Oh, yes, ma'am.
My name is Lawson Smith. I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.
Well, lovely boy... ...but he been gone a long time.
This is the address we have on his sweepstakes form.
-Sweepstakes? -Yes, I'm with Publishers Clearing House.
-Sweepstakes? -Yes, I'm with Publishers Clearing House. -He won? -Well, he's a finalist.
-He won? -Well, he's a finalist. -Million dollars. -And you must be his mother.
-Million dollars. -And you must be his mother.
Mrs. Miller. -I'm remarried. -Would you have another address...
-I'm remarried. -Would you have another address... ...or telephone number where I might be able to reach him?
...or telephone number where I might be able to reach him?
I'd love to help you get in touch with Walter.
Bet he could use the money.
But I don't know where he is.
Walter and me haven't spoke in three years.
Well, if you do talk to him, tell him we got in touch.
Thank you, ma'am.
Have a good day.
-Please leave a message. -Hey Walter, it's Mom.
Guy just come by the house looking for you. He's a cop.
It doesn't make sense. The only thing this guy cares about in life is his job.
And you know this, why?
Because he went to the Academy a few times...
...and ran field exercises? Listen to me.
...and ran field exercises? Listen to me. Pete Garrison was my best friend for 10 years.
Until he slept with my wife.
Trust me when I tell you... ...the only thing Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison. Yeah?
...the only thing Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison. Yeah?
Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola just signed in to our databases...
Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola just signed in to our databases... ...using DiPaola's password. Pulled up an address...
...using DiPaola's password. Pulled up an address... -...in Andrewsboro, Maryland. -I don't believe this.
-...in Andrewsboro, Maryland. -I don't believe this.
Get the rest of the team ready. Let's go.
Walter.
Notify intel we've got a body.
Take the cars around to the other side.
Pete.
Pete.
Damn it.
This is Breckinridge.
I'm in a boat at the end of the dock. Set up a perimeter.
I'm in a boat at the end of the dock. Set up a perimeter. -Do you copy? -Copy that.
Secret Service. Get your men on the back of the boat.
Pete, don't move.
Pete.
The traitor is still out there, Dave. Fine. If that's true, come on in.
Fine. If that's true, come on in. -We'll protect you. -The only reason I'm alive...
-We'll protect you. -The only reason I'm alive... ...is they don't know where I am.
-Don't make me do this. -No.
Don't make me do this. Pete!
You wanna shoot me?
Forget about the Kevlar. Shoot me in my face!
Dave! My buddy!
Come on, shoot me!
Come on. Shoot me.
What happened?
I took him down with a shot to the vest. I couldn't take the second shot.
What's the least contained environment the president's going to be in?
G8 Summit. Toronto.
It's a nightmare for us.
Canadians are allowing the protestors up to the perimeter.
Well, the border's not gonna stop them. It's 3500 miles long and barely patrolled.
You really think it's him, don't you?
-You scared the hell out of me. -I'm sorry.
-I can explain. -What's going on?
What the hell's been happening?
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination plot...
...by another agent.
So I wanna check his computer files, see if there's any indication of evidence.
Is that why there's a car watching the house?
The maroon Cadillac. -Who are they? -I think they're the guys who got Charlie.
-Who are they? -I think they're the guys who got Charlie.
Hand me the keys to your car. I want you to call the police.
Hand me the keys to your car. I want you to call the police. Not the Secret Service, the police.
Not the Secret Service, the police. -Tell them about the Cadillac. -Okay.
Waited three hours, nobody ever showed up.
I didn't want to stay all day. She didn't go nowhere. Didn't go nowhere, so I left.
Well, what do you want me to do?
Come on. Yes, yes. I understand.
Yeah, yeah.
What do you do? What do you want?
I'm not gonna stay there all night. It's not gonna be a problem. Yes.
No, no, no.
Yes, yes, by himself. Everything's gonna be okay.
Your name. Your name!
Who sent you? Who sent you?
Come on. Come on.
-Hi, Jill. -Pete?
Yeah. Look, I just got into a shoot-out.
1265 Leslie Northwest.
He's a foreign operative. He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.
He's got full security access to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.
Okay, Pete. We're on it. But I really think you should come in.
Yeah.
We've been through the entire place. You have to be straight with me.
-What are you talking about? -There's no body. There's blood all over the goddamn place.
There's blood all over the goddamn place.
Yeah, there's blood all over...
...but there's no body, no passports, no G8 credentials.
Listen to me. This is not enough to take back to Overbrook and clear.
Dave, I don't know what to tell you.
They're gonna hit him in Toronto, G8 Summit.
Pete. Pete.
Sarah?
Listen, I'm leaving for Toronto tonight.
Montrose wants to move me up there early for security purposes.
California. My sister. I'll call her back.
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm reasonably happy. Maybe you could take a look at that if you get a chance.
Sure. And then I'll see you tomorrow. -I'll be up after the meeting. -Okay.
-I'll be up after the meeting. -Okay. Thanks.
One new message.
Sarah, I want you to know if I don't make it, I was doing my job.
I gotta turn this off before they track me. I love you.
Get the crime scene unit out here and rip this place apart.
-Find me something now. -Yes, sir.
-Agent Breckinridge. -Agent Breckinridge?
Sarah Ballentine.
Come in.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Thanks, Tom.
-Could I offer you a drink? -No, thank you, ma'am.
You know, most women don't like whiskey...
...but my mama was from Tennessee.
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.
Please, have a seat. And that's for you.
You know, I don't know all the evidence you have against him...
...but I do know why he failed the lie detector test.
And I know why he was in that coffee shop looking for someone.
Hello. U.S. Secret Service up for the G8.
I got a priority item for the duty officer up at the lab.
That'll be that direction on the eighth floor.
-Thank you. -Sign the log, please.
I need any prints that you can find off this cup.
-Okay. -Thank you very much.
See you in about 12 minutes.
Sweeps two and three now complete.
I'm gonna be pushing post in a few minutes. If you wanna grab--
I'm gonna be pushing post in a few minutes. If you wanna grab-- -Marin. -Hey, Jill.
-It's Pete. -A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm sure they are. Did you find any prints at the apartment?
-No. Nothing. -Well, I did.
-No. Nothing. -Well, I did. You gotta help me out. If I e-mail the prints...
You gotta help me out. If I e-mail the prints... ...how long is it going to take to check them against FBI and CIA databases?
...how long is it going to take to check them against FBI and CIA databases?
Five minutes after I receive them.
Then I'll call you five minutes after I send them. All right.
I've got a print in here. Could somebody run it for me?
-Yeah, I got it. -Thank you.
In my experience, a guilty man doesn't break into a station...
...and check fingerprints for a few hours. What do you think?
My phone was only on for five minutes.
I was in the neighborhood.
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
-The other things I can. -I know about the affair.
-The other things I can. -I know about the affair. -It wasn't with Cindy. -Oh, I know. The first lady.
-It wasn't with Cindy. -Oh, I know. The first lady.
She told me everything. I know you're being framed. She showed me the blackmail photos.
I know you're being framed. She showed me the blackmail photos.
-So where does that leave us? -We need to find this guy.
-So where does that leave us? -We need to find this guy. -Come here. -Yeah.
-Come here. -Yeah.
You really are an idiot, you know that?
You thought this wouldn't be uncovered?
Dave, I love her.
That's practical.
The prints belong to Gennady Ivanov, former KGB...
...now works for the personal security service of the president of Karjastan.
I'm also showing confirmed intel... ...this is the guy responsible for the Asian pipeline attacks.
...this is the guy responsible for the Asian pipeline attacks.
-Confirmed intel on what? -I gotta call you.
This is a classified conversation. We'll be out in two minutes.
-Yeah. Whatever. -Thank you.
These people have the financial and intelligence resources to pull this off.
You still gotta find the mole.
We polygraphed every agent with access to the president.
Yours was the one that showed deception.
We need to figure out how the traitor passed or if he took it.
Montrose had the list.
You know, I never guaranteed you success.
Security's tighter than it's ever been. Routes, modes of transport...
Security's tighter than it's ever been. Routes, modes of transport... ...they're all random now.
Yeah, but not random to you, William.
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter at Camp David...
...you could have put him there.
No, you've been playing us since the beginning.
All right. Fair enough.
That's not gonna work anymore.
You did make a deal. Yeah. Twenty years ago with the KGB, which doesn't even exist anymore.
Yeah. Twenty years ago with the KGB, which doesn't even exist anymore.
Do you want out, William?
Then give me the president.
Just like you agreed.
No.
I don't care.
Expose me.
I don't care if I spend the rest of my life in prison for treason.
I don't care if you kill me.
Here you go. Have a pint.
Oh, thank you.
William...
...if you don't do this, we're not gonna kill you.
We are going to kill her.
And we're gonna kill her.
And then we're gonna kill her.
Yes, William, the KGB's gone.
But we're still here.
William, it's all right. You do have a way out.
But only one.
When he finishes his speech, take him on the primary route...
...to the B motorcade under the plaza...
...and you take the radios out.
And that's it. And we'll do the rest.
Hey, look.
You can keep those.
I've got doubles.
Jill, it's David. Get in touch with Downing and Medina.
Confirm for me which one did Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.
-We're on our way to City Hall. -Got it.
Command post from Apache, follow-up.
Arrive Martinez location, 1740 hours.
-Copy. -Summit Security, DiPaola. -Cincinnati's moving to hold. Copy. -All posts, all posts, be advised.
-Cincinnati's moving to hold. Copy. -All posts, all posts, be advised. We have an arrival. Only essential traffic at this time.
We have an arrival. Only essential traffic at this time.
-Everybody ready? -Yes, sir.
Let's do this.
-Yeah, tell me what you got. -Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
-Yeah, tell me what you got. -Montrose didn't take the polygraph. You're sure? You're 100 percent sure?
Positive. Polygraphers have no record of Montrose even being tested.
-Neither one of them. -Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
Now, let there be no mistake. In an uncertain and an unsafe world, America must be strong.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world, America must be strong.
Previous administrations....
You know, I hacked into Merriweather's staff mail.
He was streaming someone's offshore phone logs.
-The logs are Montrose's. -Give me the phone.
Jill, it's Pete. Get ahold of the first lady...
Jill, it's Pete. Get ahold of the first lady... ...and tell her, only her, that it's Montrose.
Got it.
Jesus Christ, Pete. The first lady? What were you thinking?
I never saw it coming, Dave.
Command post, from post 209...
Command post, from post 209... ...be advised, Garrison has been let through the perimeter.
-I got a scope on Garrison. -Be advised.
-I got Garrison through the three. -This resolution cannot function alone.
-I got Garrison through the three. -This resolution cannot function alone. It's designed to function....
It's Garrison and Breck.
Holster your weapon! Holster your weapon!
I'm Breckinridge, investigator. I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.
Subject in my sight. Do I take the shot?
We must ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
-We must embrace an African union. -Do you need assistance?
-Command. -He's a "Do Not Admit." -We have orders. -I'm countermanding orders.
-We have orders. -I'm countermanding orders. -You don't control. Montrose does. -Don't call him!
-You don't control. Montrose does. -Don't call him!
-Montrose is the mole. -Montrose?
-What's the procedure for that? -Where are you going?
-What's the procedure for that? -Where are you going? -I have to talk to the first lady. -No unauthorized personnel...
-I have to talk to the first lady. -No unauthorized personnel... ...beyond the two perimeter. All posts, lock down the two perimeter.
...beyond the two perimeter. All posts, lock down the two perimeter.
Something's wrong. My radio just went dead. I've lost my radio. I don't have radio.
My radio just went dead. I've lost my radio. I don't have radio.
-I'm not hearing chatter. -I've got silence.
-It's going down. -Agent Garrison called on my line.
He wanted me to tell you that Montrose is the mole.
But I strongly believe that we can protect our vital interests...
...without causing so much resentment.
Freeze, freeze, put that down. Put your hands in the air.
Mr. President, we've gotta go.
Do not let him move the president.
-This way. -Don't let Montrose move the president.
-Montrose, he's getting away right now. -Crystal!
-Montrose, he's getting away right now. -Crystal! Crystal is the password.
-We need your help. -Get the first lady to the motorcade.
-Freeze! -Password is Crystal.
-Did Montrose take him? -Motorcade B.
-Stay with me, ma'am. -It's here.
This way.
Tom, where are we going?
We're going to motorcade C.
That's a hell of a way to leave the G8.
What is going on with these goddamn radios?
Go in twos.
What's next, boss? -What's the next move? -What's next?
-What's the next move? -What's next? Bill.
Hold the corridor. Push them back.
Crystal.
Pete, we're cut off from the B motorcade.
You okay?
-I think so. -Turn off your locator.
-What? -Your locator, turn it off.
That's how they know. They're tracking us.
How do you--? How do you know?
Oh, no. Bill. Oh, God.
Montrose was....
Pete. Pete.
My family. My family, Pete.
Mr. President, you're gonna have to trust us.
We're gonna get you up top to the evac car.
Shooter's at eleven o'clock. I'll go high. You go low. You ready?
-Yeah. -Go.
Get the president upstairs. We'll cover you from here.
This way, ma'am. Quick as you can.
Yeah, it's Garrison. We need a hard car for the president at Southwest Two.
Coming to you, Pete. Go! Go! Go!
Southwest stairs. Let's go get him!
All right, we're gonna get you out of here.
Get me a perimeter. Ten meters, 360 degrees!
President's hard car. Let's get him in!
I got him. Mr. President, you're with me.
The president is away!
Go, go, go!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Secure the first lady! -We need a hard car now!
Carl.
Listen, Pete, I--
You take care of yourself now.
I'll save you a tee time.
Tom, you did a great job. I was proud to work with you.
-Thanks. -Thanks a lot.
All right. See you guys. -Take care, Pete. -Good careers.
-Thank you. Thanks. -We're gonna miss you.
Well, guys. See you soon.
-Hey, Pete. -Yeah.
This could be trouble. Oh, sh--
I'm gonna walk out of the White House carrying this?
Thanks, guys.
-Bye-bye. All the best to you. -Hey, Pete.
Gonna leave without saying goodbye?
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.
Thanks.
So how about a retirement dinner tonight?
Can't. I got a date.
Something you wanna tell me? With my wife.
That's great.
Pete. See you on campus, Jill.
-Thanks for everything. -My pleasure.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.
Something hits me square in the chest.
There's no up or down.
I don't weigh a thing.
I don't remember a thing.
(SIGHS) This doesn't look good at all.
I've gone and done something again.
Wish I could remember what.
How did I get here?
What have I done? And why?
I must've forgotten my medicine.
I've got a condition.
It's bad to forget your medicine when you've got a condition.
Caught myself a bullet.
The wound's fresh. Maybe an hour old.
I can't remember how I got it.
For the life of me, I can't remember.
The projects.
Ugly as ever.
What the hell am I doing here?
Put the pieces together.
Remember.
It's Saturday,
so I must've started the night at Kadie's joint.
Just another Saturday night.
Me and all the other losers like me,
sucking back the sauce and drooling like fools over Nancy.
I was in a mood.
Even watching Nancy couldn't cheer me up.
I get that way sometimes.
Empty in the gut,
hollow in that lonely place.
And wishing I had an excuse to break somebody's face.
It was just another Saturday night.
I was wondering what I was gonna do with myself,
when I smelled something awful.
Burning hair.
Burning meat.
Like these poor old winos didn't have it bad enough already.
Damn frat boys.
Damn rich, spoiled brats.
Leave him be.
Crawl back into your bottle, Bernini boy.
Why'd he call me Bernie?
At least I know they're bad guys.
Nothing wrong with killing the bunch of them.
Hell, it's practically my civic duty.
Who were these wimpy little twits?
I hate these guys.
God, this really hurts.
They made a run for it. I did what any good citizen would do.
-(SIRENS WAILING) -Aw, hell.
What the hell?
What the hell?
What the hell?
That's when I got my idea.
If they got back to their university out in Sacred Oaks,
I'd never catch them.
I banged them around like a hockey puck.
Cut them off at every turn.
I left them no choice but to head over the hill to the projects.
I could just turn my back and leave them here.
My old neighbours would take care of them but good.
But hell,
why should they have all the fun?
The projects.
I was born here.
My old neighbourhood.
BUZZ: Damn.
He's a dead man.
I'm telling you, I'm one bitch of a good shot and he's a dead man.
My old neighbours.
They let me know they're watching.
I remind them who I am.
I tell them what to do.
BUZZ: No! No, please!
Please, I've got money. I've got a trust fund. I can pay.
You'll pay.
Before you shot me, you called me Bernie. Why'd you call me Bernie?
Bernini.
It's a brand name. That coat you're wearing.
It's a Bernini.
Thanks for clearing that up, kid.
Knife!
Bernini, huh?
And one fine coat it is.
Somebody must've spent a fortune on it.
I wonder who.
And while I'm at it...
Where the heck did I get these gloves?
I can't remember for the life of me.
Poker.
Savage power in gentlemen's hands.
(CHUCKLES) It's a good game.
Now...
Who wants to play?
JOHNNY: Sin City's where you go in with your eyes open,
or you don't come out at all.
But a city's like a woman or a casino,
somebody's gonna win.
And it's gonna be me.
It's the kind of place your father doesn't wanna talk about.
Though where I come from,
a father is a thing no one seems to be able to find.
I was feeling lucky.
I'd won money in joints all over town and I'd finally made it to Kadie's,
where the real score is.
MAN: What happened to the show?
How's tricks, stranger?
-Heads or tails? -Heads.
That's a trick.
That won't get you anywhere. (CHUCKLES)
Follow the shiny object.
-Where'd you come from, handsome? -Do me a favour and blow on this.
-Does Lady Luck have a name? -Marcie.
Lucky man.
Every time, ma'am. Now, where's the real action?
Baby, you don't wanna know.
I do wanna know.
Whatever you say, boss.
Back of the bar. It's your funeral. They'll eat you alive back there.
I'm a pretty tough chew. Come on.
Would you kiss it this time?
Oh, my God!
-Hey there, Marcie. -Yeah?
-You wanna go make some real money? -Mmm-hmm, yeah.
MAN: I'll check.
I'll bet a hundred.
Good night.
I'll play.
MAN: I'll fold.
Who's the slicker?
I busted this one for craps over at Josie's once.
He paid up. He's okay.
Whatever you do, kid, don't win too much.
-I never lose. -(ALL LAUGHING)
-What's with bringing a frail in here? -This is my good luck charm.
Besides, I'm heading to make a pretty nice dime tonight.
Gotta have someone to spend it on, right?
Sylvio, let our young friend here do the honours, huh?
JOHNNY: Cut. ROARK: Mmm. (CHUCKLES)
This boy's good.
CROWD: (CHANTING) Nancy! Nancy! Nancy!
Nancy! Nancy! Nancy!
And the dealer will take two.
-ABDUL: One hand in. -I'll play.
MAN: I'm out.
SYLVIO: Yeah, me too.
-ABDUL: I fold. -I'm done.
How dumb are you feeling now, boy?
Pretty dumb.
(CROWD CHANTING IN DISTANCE) Nancy, Nancy, Nancy!
Well, Senator, I'm ready for your worst.
Boy, you don't even wanna dream about my worst.
No, I don't imagine I do.
So why don't I just flatten your ass right now and we can call it a night?
Sure. This is a fair game, played by honourable men.
I'm gonna raise you 300.
Easy, kid.
You got any idea what you're up against?
Looks to me like I'm up against a man.
You're up against a Roark.
Yeah, I was born here, Senator. I know who you are.
We all die here sooner or later.
I'm gonna raise you another 500.
(LAUGHS) I like this kid.
I like him a lot.
I'm gonna call you.
You won't be needing anything for cab fare, will you?
Now that's as fine a hand as you'll ever have, friend.
You just keep in mind what hands are made out of.
Will do.
Hey.
Get your ass outta here. Run like hell, you might still have a chance.
Oh, I can't miss tomorrow night's game.
Not any more than you can, Officer.
Besides, I already promised Marcie a night on the town.
I can't protect you.
Then why are you a cop?
Where we going, Johnny?
Everywhere.
HARTIGAN: One of these days she'll pull the trigger,
and then there's nothing I can do.
There's nothing I can do now.
And all I can do is ask you...
...is don't.
Don't avenge me, Nancy.
It'll be the death of you.
I can't help.
I can't watch.
Death is just like life in Sin City.
There's nothing you can do.
And love doesn't conquer anything at all.
Good luck, Nancy.
Live while you're alive.
Just try, sweetheart.
JOHNNY: We make Sin City history.
Hit every hot spot in town.
I blow through almost as much cash as I make at the tables.
The trouble starts when I try to use my credit cards.
I'm sure there must be some mistake. We'd be happy to extend you a line of credit.
How can all of them go bad on the same night?
It's not like you don't have cash.
That's not the point. Come on.
We gotta get you home.
Something comes up behind us.
Smells all wrong.
This will slow us down.
You get to the side, Marcie. I gotta break some bones.
What are you talking about, you silly?
You just stay right there.
Gentlemen, listen, I think I know what this is about,
and I want you to know, you'll have no resistance from me.
That blackjack you've got in your hand could split somebody's skull open.
-What the hell was that all about? -You stay out of sight now.
You'll be safe in Old Town.
Meet me at the Three Sheets Hotel. Room 166.
(MUMBLES IN CONFUSION)
Let's get this over with.
Don't enjoy it too much, fellas.
You made a fool of me, boy.
Right in front of the wrong people.
You took your chances like we all did. And you lost.
Do you have any idea how easy I kill little snots like you?
Now, let's see about that winning hand.
Powerful men watch what happens at that table.
I need them to know the price of defiance.
Power is a fragile thing.
It tolerates no threat.
Defiance must be met with an example of the wages of defiance.
You'd be smart to kill me now.
I'll do far worse than kill you, boy.
What you have encountered, boy, is power.
Every time the wind blows cold and wet, that thing that was your hand
will clutch at your leg in arthritic agony.
Whenever it rains, you'll remember me.
You'll remember me all the time...
My son.
Oh, yeah. I know who you are.
I knew you were one of mine the minute I saw you.
Family resemblance, my boy.
I don't give a damn. I only had one real son.
Ethan, may he rest in peace. And he could have been president.
Did you really think that I was gonna claim you?
JOHNNY: You beat me, Roark.
But when I get back,
it'll be a whole different game.
DWIGHT: It's another hot night. Dry and windless.
The kind that makes people do sweaty, secret things.
Things worth money to me.
JOEY: This is the last time, Sally. This has gotta be the last time.
-SALLY: You always say that. -I mean it this time.
DWIGHT: She glides out of her coat like it was Christmas wrapping,
playing it for all it's worth.
And it's worth plenty.
-JOEY: This is the end for us. -The end for us?
It's my wife. She's asking all kinds of questions.
She suspects something. She'll sue and she'll get everything.
Everything!
Everything you've worked so hard for.
I work my butt off. I built my business up from out of nothing.
Nothing.
Nobody appreciates you, do they, Joey? Not the way you deserve.
JOEY: Nobody.
Not the employees, who would be out on the street if it wasn't for me.
Not my wife, who I found on the street.
-She lives in that mansion you bought her. -Wearing all those clothes that I got her!
-With my money, my hard-earned money! -I think you're so strong.
You're damn right about that. But do I get any credit?
They just take and take and take!
One of these days I'm gonna fire the whole pack of them!
I'm gonna show them who's boss!
Show me, Joey. Show me who's boss.
Yeah. I'll show you. I'm gonna show you!
JOEY: I'll show you who's boss!
DWIGHT: Then she's moaning and saying "boss" in time with his movements.
-(JOEY GRUNTING) -SALLY: Boss! Boss!
It's all over pretty quickly. (GROANS)
I get everything I need.
The sad thing is, some of the compositions are pretty good.
(SIGHS) You made me feel like a woman.
I know it sounds corny, but it's true.
I love you, baby.
You know I love you. Even when you lie to me.
My wrist hurts, Joey.
You think you could get the key? It's just in my purse.
You don't have any idea how much I've sacrificed.
What are you doing, Joey?
It's tearing me up, how much I love you and what I gotta do.
But I've worked too hard.
JOEY: And Gloria will get everything.
And I can't let that happen.
I don't have a choice. It's all her fault.
Joey, please, I... I won't tell anyone, I swear to God.
I know you won't wanna talk. I know that. But you're only human.
Oh, my aching back.
Gloria's gonna find out about you if she doesn't know already,
and she's gonna offer you a lot of money.
My money! And she's gonna give it to you to bring me down!
Then I'll go away!
Who's gonna pay for the ticket? The ticket and God knows what else?
Then the apartment? The clothes? The car?
You're gonna suck me dry and you'll never, ever stop!
No! Please! No!
-Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! -(GRUNTS)
Nobody's killing anybody. Not while I'm around.
Then can I have a ride?
I grab the key and uncuff her.
She gives him a good-bye that'll still hurt like hell when he comes to. (GRUNTS)
I leave the slob handcuffed to the bed for housekeeping to find.
I take Redondo over the hill toward Old Town.
Thanks for my life, man.
Sally blends into the sea of flesh that is Old Town.
They all come back,
the damn Old Town memories.
Drunken mornings and sweaty sex and stupid, bloody brawls.
And that thing I did. You can't just pick and choose.
You can't take the good without the bad.
Not once you let the monster out. I can't let it out.
Never again.
I drive 10 blocks out of my way and stop for gas I don't need,
avoiding the worst of this job,
my employer,
the wife.
This one's got a lawyer to pay the tab, so it's easier.
Please leave by the servants' exit.
The Mustang shudders,
begging to cut loose and show what it can do.
It wants to take me all the way.
I don't let it.
I think about all the ways I've screwed up
and what I'd give for one clear chance to wipe the slate clean.
I'd give anything just to cut loose.
Just to feel the fire
one more time.
Never lose control.
Not for a second.
Never let the monster out.
Remember when you did.
Remember what you did.
-Yeah? -Dwight, is that you?
-Ava. -I'm sorry to call.
I know I've got no right. But I need to see you.
Tonight.
Please, Dwight. Don't hang up. Please.
DWIGHT: She keeps talking. Like an idiot, I keep listening.
Ava. Damn.
I should tell her to go to hell.
Instead I show up 20 minutes early.
What the hell could she want with me now?
You can't drive two blocks in Sin City without coming across a saloon.
The bad kind.
Why here, Ava?
With you, everything always had to be first class.
And when I couldn't foot the bill,
you sure as hell found somebody who could.
I order up a ginger ale and stare at it for the better part of an hour.
She's late, like she always was.
And like always...
she's worth the wait.
Dwight.
How long has it been?
Four years?
Yeah, sounds about right.
Have a seat.
So many times I've wanted to call you.
I found myself thinking about you.
Constantly. I've got places to go. How about you just tell me what you want?
I've got places to go. How about you just tell me what you want?
Don't be cold. I don't think I could stand that right now.
I must still mean something to you.
-You came here, you must still care. -Sure.
You called and I came running.
You've still got that much of a hold on me. Maybe you always will.
But I got no reason at all to be nice to you.
-I guess I deserve that. -Let's not screw around.
I'm here. I'm listening.
Just tell me what the hell it is you want.
There's only one thing I want from you,
and I want it so desperately I could scream.
I want you to forgive me.
So you've got a conscience, after all.
Fine. I forgive you. You got your wish.
Now go home. Sleep tight.
You're right about me.
I'm a selfish slut who threw away the only man she ever loved.
-But I was wrong. -Good one.
I was born at night, but it wasn't last night.
I'm in hell, Dwight. It's worse than you can imagine.
You made your bed. Sleep in it.
-Forgive me, darling, I beg you. -No.
-I love you. -No.
No!
You do that again, I swear to hell I'll kill you.
If you can't forgive me then please remember me.
They say you really never die as long as somebody remembers you.
What the devil are you talking about?
Mrs Lord...
The weather is inclement, the neighbourhood is bad
and your present company...is low.
You're due at home, Mrs Lord.
I'd say that's up to Mrs Lord.
This is none of your concern, sir.
Any physical contest between us would have one outcome.
Hey, buddy.
Is that dickhead giving you a hard time?
You want me to break him down for you?
I ain't got nothing going on tonight.
That would be an interesting contest.
It's not his fight.
Never mind, Dwight. It's too late. I'll go with him.
Too late for what, Ava?
For everything.
Just remember me, my love.
AVA: Remember me.
You will have business tonight, Mrs Lord.
Unpleasant business.
AVA: I don't care any more.
DWIGHT: The night air hasn't gotten any colder.
It just feels that way.
Buddy, I don't mean to poke my nose where it don't belong, but...
That there is a dame to kill for.
Ava.
Damn!
Night turns to day and then it's night again
and there's nowhere to hide.
She isn't worth a moment's thought and I can't get her out of my head.
What am I doing smoking?
Where did I get these cigarettes?
It's Ava making you crazy...
All over again.
Never let the monster out.
Shake her off.
Whatever she's in for, she deserves it.
But I have to know what's wrong.
It's a couple hours' drive out to Sacred Oaks.
It shouldn't take too much effort to get to the bottom of this.
Just a simple job of breaking and entering,
punishable by up to five years in the slammer, even if I don't kill anybody.
I wind up seeing a lot more of Ava than I bargained for.
And she seems perfectly goddamned fine.
Not roughed up,
just the rich man's wife she always intended to be.
I'm a damned fool.
Freeze, pervert.
Let me through, Manute.
I'm sorry, Dwight.
An atom bomb goes off between my legs.
A freight train barrels into my jaw.
I've taken a beating before, but never like this.
Never like this.
The sounds go wet. Maybe he keeps hitting me.
I don't know. I'm gone.
Gone to that place where there is no pain or thought.
I wake up in mid-air.
The pavement rushes up to give me a big, sloppy kiss.
DWIGHT: I'll be damned. Door-to-door service.
Then I spot my Mustang,
which makes no sense.
Why would they return my car?
Get outta here.
No.
Put your clothes back on and get outta here. Now.
No.
You had your chance.
I would have stayed away, but you came for me.
You still want me.
And I'm yours. Now.
Tonight.
Get outta my life once and for all,
or I'll bash your teeth in.
If you can't love me,
hate me.
If you can't forgive me, punish me.
Make me hurt like I've hurt you.
I call her every foul name there is.
She makes my name sound like music,
like a chant to some dark god.
She's slippery with sweat.
Before long my hatred is spent,
but she won't let go.
She kisses me and coaxes me,
and the fire grows again.
I say all the things I swore I'd never say again.
She owns me.
Body and soul.
Tell me everything.
Manute, the man who beat you,
he's a specialist in inflicting pain.
Hideous pain, in all the places you just gave me joy.
That's sick.
That's crazy.
Damien, my husband,
he talks and talks and watches.
It's worse each time.
He's getting closer to his final, sick climax.
He says I'll be very ugly before I die.
Baby, you're not gonna die.
You're coming with me.
(CHUCKLES) It's hopeless.
He lets me run away. Even laughs about it.
He doesn't care where I go, what I do.
He knows Manute will always find me.
Isn't that right, Manute?
Madam... Mr Lord will require that you be disciplined.
No, Dwight. Don't fight him!
He'll kill you. He's not human.
I punch a vault door. It doesn't fall down, so I punch it again.
A wrecking ball hits me square in the chest.
Mrs Lord, your coat.
We have an appointment.
They can't take her away from me.
Not this time.
I know exactly what to do.
I know exactly where to go.
Now here's a girl with protection.
She may be showing off everything she's got in a ratty dive full of horny drunks,
but Nancy's the safest gal in the world.
Make a grab for Nancy, and you're up against 300 pounds of iron
that goes by the name of Marv. (COUNTRY & WESTERN MUSIC PLAYING)
Marv.
Dwight.
I didn't even see you there.
-What can I do you for? -I need your help.
It's bad. It means going up against a lot of guns.
Count me in.
I could use a change of pace.
We finish off the bottle, letting its liquid darkness fill us both.
When I'm sure he's had enough to make him good and dangerous,
I tell him about Ava and his eyes go killer red.
I know he's willing to die for me, if that's what it takes.
So I'm using him. So what?
So he breaks the faces I want him to break instead of somebody else's.
So he helps me get Ava back in my arms again
instead of sleeping it off in a flophouse or a gutter.
His life isn't worth a damn, anyway.
If I don't get him killed, the world will. One way or another.
I want you to leave that thing in the car.
Nobody's getting killed tonight.
Aw, come on, Dwight. You ain't no fun at all.
DWIGHT: We split up at the gate.
It doesn't take Marv long to get their attention.
You've trespassed on hallowed ground.
You're the slug that hurt my friend, huh?
Shall we?
Haven't had my hand around one of these in days.
I'll find the truth about Ava and what's happening to her now.
He'll tell me.
I'll get it out of him.
Damien Lord.
Where is she?
What have you done with her?
Have you come to take her away from all this? (CHUCKLES)
And what is "all this", in her present stories?
I haven't the slightest notion what nonsense my wife has told you.
Nor do I care.
It's all lies.
Stay away from the desk.
The woman is pathological.
You've been deceived.
What did it feel like?
What?
Murdering an innocent man.
I just want to know what it felt like.
It must have been beautiful.
What are you talking about, innocence?
I knew I could count on you.
Sex always made you stupid, ready to believe anything. (CHUCKLES)
You've just made me a very rich woman. (COCKS GUN)
Do me one last favour, lover.
Stay still long enough for me to blow your brains out.
I'm not much of a shot.
-But I do my best. -Ava...
I planned it and you fell for it.
This is the last time I'm ever gonna need anything from a man.
The last time I make my living on my back.
Manute never hurt you?
He wouldn't dare.
-You're insane. -No, Dwight.
A crazy person would be anyone who believes me.
And that would be you.
If I kissed you now, Dwight,
would you still believe it was...love?
Ava.
Damn!
MARV: Hey, I handled that big slug just like I promised.
I didn't kill him, I didn't even cripple him.
Six months in traction, that's all, tops. I took an eye out of him, though.
Listen, before you say anything,
I know I was supposed to take the 'Stang to make my getaway.
But when I saw this beauty here sitting there...
You know, and the keys in the ignition and everything,
I couldn't pass up a chance to
take a drive in an honest-to-God Tucker.
OFFICER: Pull over!
You know, they only made a couple dozen of these beauties.
I saw a movie about it once.
Oh, here I am jabbering, and you're leaking all over the place.
I'll get you to a guy I know.
He's good with bullets and he don't ask no questions.
Get me to Old Town.
Let me level with you, pal. You ain't gonna make it to Old Town.
DWIGHT: I'll make it.
I've got too much I've gotta do to let myself die.
Old Town.
He left a lot of blood, Mrs Lord.
He won't get far.
Now, you said you knew him.
The killer's name's Dwight.
Dwight McCarthy.
You knew him in what sense?
Why, the Biblical one.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
You've been so very patient with me. Here we've barely met, and already I...
I feel I can trust you.
You can trust me.
We were together for a while a few years ago.
It went badly.
He went insane.
He started imagining things, accusing me of things.
He followed me wherever I went.
Recently he broke into this very property.
He beat you?
When he drank.
He drank a lot.
-You stayed with this nutcase? -Never mind that.
You'd be surprised how much a woman can take.
You were terrified.
It was Damien who took me away.
He was so gentle and sure.
I suppose I'm a woman who needs protection.
He made me feel safe.
But then... Dwight, he found me somehow.
He started calling me late at night, making awful threats.
(SOBBING) And now Damien's dead and I'm alone.
Oh, please, Lieutenant!
Call me Mort.
Nothing like a widow in need of comfort.
I got a stiffy just watching. Man, she is primed.
-Just drop it, Bob. -You don't pass up a chance like that.
What's the point of being a Sin City cop if you don't get the perks?
I'm a married man, Bob.
BOB: (LAUGHS) I don't care what you are. I mean, just take a look at that babe.
That's enough, Bob.
DWIGHT: This doesn't look good.
One squad car still chases us.
Must be a rookie driving.
His buddies should have told him the girls of Old Town have laws all their own.
And they don't take kindly to cops.
Old Town! (CHUCKLES) Oh, you're a genius, kid!
Old Town! (CHUCKLES) Oh, you're a genius, kid! (GROANS)
MARV: Here we are, pal.
All of a sudden this doesn't look like the brightest idea you ever had.
You have 10 seconds to tell us what you're doing bringing cops to Old Town.
Here's the problem.
I don't fight girls.
Gail.
-It's me. -Dwight!
What have they done to you?
A corkscrew stabs me square in the chest... (GROANS)
...and twists.
Get Molly!
Get everybody.
It's about time.
-Hello? -Mrs Lord.
Lieutenant.
Mort.
-You're so kind to call. -I hope I didn't wake you.
No, I wasn't sleeping. I haven't slept at all.
I'm jumping at every sound, just knowing he's still out there.
I guess I'm not a very strong person.
And me in this house, all alone.
You shouldn't be so hard on yourself, Mrs Lord.
You're having a very understandable reaction.
If there's anything at all I can do for you...
I know it's a bad thing to think of you the way I do.
It's...
...inconvenient.
But who ever loved, who loved not at first sight?
I've thought about you since I saw you.
I'm thinking about you now.
Are you thinking about me?
Yes.
I hate myself for saying this, but,
I just don't know if I could bear to be alone tonight.
DWIGHT: My heart beats. I take in the rich, burnt smell of coffee.
Gail.
She's reason enough to open my eyes.
Can you hear me, Dwight?
The cops want you bad, Dwight.
Really bad.
But don't worry.
We'll fix you up.
And when we do,
when you're all better...
I'll deck you for leaving in the first place.
I told you you'd be back.
I told you.
You belong here.
Jerk!
I thought there was another world out there.
I thought I could be a part of it.
There's only Sin City.
-Molly said you're ready to leave. -No. I'm staying.
Wrong answer. Miho?
DWIGHT: Deadly little Miho.
If she recognises me, she doesn't let it show.
Oh, you picked the wrong neighbourhood for your hideout.
-Alive or dead, you're leaving. -I'm staying.
I don't think he can feel it, Miho. Give it a twist.
You won't give with any more lip about staying here or Miho will have to...
Exhale.
And that heart Molly worked so hard to fix will just pop like a grape.
He's staying.
And if you're going to kill him...
You'd better kill me, too.
Even though he doesn't feel the same way about me,
he's the only man I'll ever love.
They all seem to be waiting for the other shoe to drop.
Gail drops it.
It was dark in that alley, Miho,
when you were 15.
You killed three of the Tong.
GAIL: But the last two had the drop on you.
-You were dead. -(GUNSHOTS)
Until someone appeared.
You never got a good look at the man who saved you.
Take a look now.
DWIGHT: I get more time.
And more surgery.
Listen, there's only one person that has anything to gain from snuffing Damien Lord
and you're too busy banging the broad to bring her in for questioning!
You don't know her. You don't know anything about her.
And I'll be damned if I let you use that kind of language when you talk about her.
You're in love with her.
You stupid schmuck!
It's one thing to poke a babe on the side, but you can't even think straight!
It's one thing to poke a babe on the side, but you can't even think straight! Shut the hell up!
I know what I'm doing.
I guess I should have told you everything.
You're damn right you should've.
He raped me.
He almost killed me.
That son of a bitch.
I thought I could reason with him, but...
He was worse than ever.
His hands at my throat,
strangling me while he did what he needed to do. -(ZIPPER UNZIPS) -(GRUNTS)
Not while I'm around!
He'll kill me, kill me, kill me!
I have only you. I love you, Mort. Keep me safe.
-Keep me, keep me, keep me! -(PHONE RINGING)
-(MORT SIGHS) -Ava Lord.
For once you missed my heart.
I'm healing quickly, Ava.
I'll be coming for you soon.
You know where he is and you won't do a damn thing about it.
You don't know what you're asking.
We have to wait for Old Town to give him up. It's the only way.
You're a Sin City cop.
You've got a badge and a gun. You've got power.
Use it.
If you ever want to have this woman again...
Be a man.
If you're a man...
Kill him.
Don't move.
McCarthy.
You never tortured her.
You two cooked that up.
-You were her lover. -You're a fool.
The Goddess takes no lover. The Goddess makes slaves of men.
In an instant she can see to the heart of you,
and transform to your deepest desire.
To Damien Lord, she was the princess bride.
To you, a damsel in distress.
She devoured all of you.
You cannot defeat the Goddess.
She cannot die.
You're as crazy as she is.
If you were as rotten as her, I would blow your brains out right now.
But I'm trying to be careful about who I kill.
And all you did was pound the crap outta me.
You've already paid an eye for that.
I'm letting you go with a warning.
Stay in bed.
Don't go back to work.
And don't get in my way.
DWIGHT: No, Ava, you're no goddess.
You're a witch.
A predator.
Maybe I only got what I deserved, but what about the others?
Good men driven mad.
BOB: You really lost it.
Bad enough you leave your wife for that skank.
You watch what you call her, you son of a bitch.
You're throwing away your career.
Hell, you're committing suicide, you stupid shit!
I know what I'm doing. I'm going to Old Town.
And I'm gonna nail this guy once and for all.
If I have to go it alone,
I will.
Do me a favour and turn the car around,
and you go back to the station.
-You've gotta come clean with the Captain. -I'm a cop. I'm doing my job.
I'm hunting down a murderer.
-Look, you've gotta ditch that dame! -That's enough!
-We won't talk about Ava. -Somebody has gotta set you straight.
You've gotta forget about that stupid whore.
Turn the car around or I'm turning you in!
I warned you.
Every day I warned you!
But you keep asking for it and asking for it!
Well, here it is, pal!
Mort, no...
DWIGHT: A witch.
A predator.
Destroying lives.
Sometimes for power.
Sometimes for profit.
Sometimes for sport.
But now you're locked away in your mansion,
a bird of prey in a gilded cage.
Are you ready to do something stupid?
I'm so happy you chose to attend my little party, Herr Wallenquist.
Your invitation surprised me, Mrs Lord.
Your husband had no criminal associations.
Believe me, I tried.
-May I speak truthfully, Mr Wallenquist? -Please.
Old Town is a thorn in your side.
Indeed it is.
All those profits, in the hands of whores.
Surely you've wanted to put them in their place,
make some adjustment in the balance of power,
show them who rules Sin City.
You have limited influence on me, Mrs Lord.
I haven't been doing so very badly.
But those two policemen, that was an embarrassing blunder.
Yes.
I'm out of my league.
I need a stronger, more experienced hand.
I need Lord Enterprises joined in matrimony
with the expertise and iron fist of Alarich Wallenquist.
What you need is the corpse of Dwight McCarthy
and a suicide note in which he confesses to the murder of Damien Lord.
And you need to show those Old Town bitches who's boss.
Indeed I do.
WALLENQUIST: There is a specialist in Texas.
I can have him on a train tomorrow.
AVA: I'll brief him myself.
WALLENQUIST: He'll be on your doorstep at midnight.
AVA: And I'll be yours forever.
WALLENQUIST: Pray for your soul, Ava.
This won't be its last visit to Sin City.
MANUTE: Good evening, Mr Campbell.
-I'll take your bag. -Nobody touches my gear.
And I've got somebody picking me up who's one hell of a lot cuter than you.
It was our understanding that you would travel alone.
I'm full of surprises.
Shuffle that booty over to the shotgun side, doll.
I'm driving.
-We'll follow you. -Mrs Lord may not be pleased.
She's the one with a problem. I can always get back on the train.
Wait here.
Hurry back.
You know I get impatient.
And you know I get a little crazy when I get impatient.
Boogaard.
Watch this woman.
Jacoby.
If this man moves, kill him.
I thought this was business.
My compliments to your surgeon, Mr McCarthy.
A remarkable transformation, but you still have the eyes.
The eyes of a dead man.
I hate being left alone.
When I'm alone,
it makes me wanna do all kinds of crazy things.
No woman should be left alone with a man like you.
Do you want me
to do something we shouldn't?
My lips are sealed.
There's something I need in the trunk.
Bear witness.
MANUTE: Mrs Lord, the specialist has arrived.
DWIGHT: The bathing thing with her was never about bathing.
It was always theatre.
Or maybe it was retail.
You can't make a sale without showing the goods.
It's McCarthy.
AVA: Do you mind if I say that you're twice the man I thought you were?
You're a warrior.
A killer.
You're everything I want out of a man, but I could never get the honesty out of you.
You could have been everything I needed.
You still could be.
You're a new man.
DWIGHT: Remember what she did.
Remember what she is.
Wait for your opening.
Wait for Gail to do her bit.
When you're immune to me, I'll let you know.
Step back, mistress. Let me kill him.
Please...
...do.
Six shots and not a single head wound.
DWIGHT: Then it all gets down to speed and luck.
Her eyes are wet and full of love.
I never dreamed.
You're everything I've ever wanted.
Everything I need.
You and me... Forever.
It's over.
Pain has set you free.
You're not good any more, Dwight.
You're more like me. Be like me.
Let the old Dwight go, let it go with his old face.
DWIGHT: She pulls close and I've got to look.
And all I want is to be lost in the sight
and sound and smell of her.
I can't think straight.
We can be free. We can be happy.
Together...
...forever.
No.
Her kiss is a promise of paradise.
Dwight.
The gun barks and bucks in my hand.
Life leaves Ava with a sigh.
Sirens climb the hill.
We'll take the back roads, the old bootlegger roads.
They'll never catch us.
I'm going home.
JOHNNY: Walk down the right back alley in Sin City
and you can find anything.
I was told I could find a man here by the name of Mr Kroenig.
That's Dr Kroenig to you.
Yes, sir.
Licence or no licence,
these hands still got what it takes.
Once I'm prepped.
How much you got?
40 bucks you got.
40 bucks' worth you get.
Steady as a rock...
...once I'm prepped.
40 bucks got you the bullet.
But that hand of yours...
That's a lot of bones need setting.
I'll give you an hour...
...for your shoes.
Take 'em.
I do my best to think about winning...
Revenge.
The old man must like popsicles. He uses the sticks for splints.
He licks them first.
Not so much as a goddamn thank you.
Generosity just don't count for shit this... day and age.
JOHNNY: Quite a job you did on me, Roark.
Even my shoes.
There's nothing more you could take.
Except...
Marcie.
The girl!
Oh, my Christ.
Marcie.
Oh, Marcie, you weren't a part of this.
You were just there to throw 'em off their game.
What have I dragged you into?
This has turned into one long, bad night.
The window's not locked.
Never a good sign.
Not in Sin City.
ROARK: Look who decided to show up.
Give the man a hand.
Give the man another hand.
Ruined, penniless, friendless and forgotten.
You'd really be better off dead, Johnny.
But I like you just the way you are!
I got cocky.
I got cocky and I got Marcie dead.
Damn it, Johnny.
Hate yourself when you've got the time.
Think about tonight's game.
That's all that matters now.
And all you need is money.
Just one lousy buck would be enough to get you started.
Hello, ma'am.
I don't have the money to pay, but could I ask you for a glass of water?
Yeah.
Times are tough all over.
Thank you.
WAITRESS: What's with the hand?
I beat the wrong guy at cards.
Tough break.
Thank you very much.
Just a second, you.
You don't stink of anything I don't like
and you kinda remind me of an old boyfriend, okay?
This won't take you very far.
Sweetheart...
It's gonna take me to the moon.
Sin City...
You never know.
Just don't spend it all in one place. -(COIN CLINKS) -(LEVER CLANKS)
Hey, handsome. What you gonna do with all that?
I'm gonna kill Roark.
(CHUCKLES) The Roarks, they don't die that easy.
I just might surprise you.
Looks like something happened to your game hand, son.
I'll fold.
What's wrong, hotshot?
No good without that Lady Luck you brought the last time?
I'll be fine.
LIEBOWITZ: I'm done. MAN: I'm out.
ROARK: I need three.
SYLVIO: Dealer takes two.
-ABDUL: Check. -Check.
I'll bet $100.
Shit.
Fold.
Just not the same without your game hand, is it?
I'm ambidextrous.
Cut.
-Check. -Check.
$500.
SYLVIO: I'm in.
I'll raise you...
$500 more.
-I'll fold. -I'm done.
I raise you $500 more, pretty boy.
You favour your mother. She was a whore.
And not a very good one.
She was an angel.
I'm all in.
For the works.
Call.
That's four aces.
See, I told you, I never lose.
I beat you.
Twice.
That means I'm better than you are.
And everybody knows it.
Because I beat you again, every time somebody tells that story,
and they'll all say that they won't tell it, but they will.
That's the story that'll be told again and again until you're dead,
and long after you're dead.
I beat you forever.
Now they'll all know what happens when you do.
Say hello to your mama.
She always was a stupid bitch.
ROARK: Power is as power does.
If I could give any young man advice, it would be this.
Wear a rubber.
Now take out that trash. Let's get back to the game.
NANCY: I can't lose you. Not again.
You'll never lose me, Nancy.
LIEBOWITZ: All this time,
she was right there.
Dancing in the club where you play poker.
You've got to have been looking for a chance
to put this one through the ringer, Senator.
Nancy Callahan.
My son Ethan was killed because of her.
LIEBOWITZ: It's been four years now,
and still she's planting flowers at Hartigan's grave.
She's showing gratitude, from the looks of it, to the cop.
Gratitude to the cop,
who ripped your son to pieces.
ROARK: Hartigan turned my son into a freak.
Well,
completed him as a freak.
But I can hardly blame the young lady for...
-Obsession? -(CHUCKLES)
Just let the little fluff drown in her sorrow.
It might not be that simple.
Somehow, she got her hands on Hartigan's old pistol.
LIEBOWITZ: She hits the range every night just before work.
-She's become quite a good shot. -(BULLETS CLINKING)
And I can only imagine whose face she sees on that target.
I'm listening.
She's been acting kind of crazy sometimes at work.
She's drinking. Just in the past few weeks.
She never drank before.
It's all like she's building up to something,
maybe building her nerve.
That'll be all, Lieutenant.
This little bitch is turning me on.
NANCY: This place stinks.
I never used to notice.
Not when I danced.
But now I smell everything.
I see it all.
Every damn thing.
I know exactly where I am.
I know exactly what I am.
I don't use the stripper logic any more.
That they're losers and I'm not.
It was when I couldn't shoot him that I realised I was dead.
That I wasn't a woman with a plan.
I was just a drunk.
I give them what they want.
Then I get the hell out of there.
ACTOR ON TV: Are you still there, Sam?
ACTOR 2: He shot me in the gut.
It wasn't me, Sam.
It was the babe.
This rotten town.
It soils everybody it touches.
This rotten town.
Those it can't corrupt, it soils.
It soiled you, John Hartigan.
Put that bottle down, Nancy.
You've had enough.
It made you lie to me.
You're not even here right now.
You said you'd never leave me.
I've never left you.
I never will.
Never.
You're not even here right now.
You're dead.
You blew your brains out.
You stuck your gun in your mouth
and you blew your brains out.
I had my reasons.
-There was no way out. -I hate you!
You swore you'd always love me.
And I always will.
HARTIGAN: No one has ever really guessed what hell is.
It's watching the people you love...
...in pain.
You're the only man I ever loved.
And you left me alone.
NANCY: You never thought we'd stand a chance against goddamn Senator Roark.
You didn't believe in me.
You didn't think a little piece of ass like me
could take down the most powerful man in the state.
(LAUGHING)
Maybe I'll prove both of you wrong.
Or maybe I'll go crazy.
Crazy is sounding pretty good right now.
I love you, Nancy.
ROARK: You little slut.
You're gonna scream before you die.
You're out of your mind.
I appreciate
the obsession,
but you've got nothing.
You could have killed me 50 times if you had the nerve.
But you don't.
You are nothing.
(INHALES) You'll scream
just like my boy wanted you to.
Darling, where have you been?
And what have you done to your beautiful hair?
Don't worry. Those bastards will get what they want.
They always get what they want.
This is great! This...
What's up with you?
Something's wrong.
I'm outta here.
It's like watching my sister do the nasty.
I'm taking a hike.
Pretty.
You're beautiful, Nancy.
HARTIGAN: Don't do this to yourself.
Pretty, pretty, pretty.
If a man did that to you, I'd tear him to pieces.
Lieutenant Hartigan... You just gave me a great idea.
No, baby. Nancy...
Just give me a damn name.
Roark.
We're up against a lot. We'll need tools.
Looks like trouble.
-(GUNS COCKING) -MARV: No.
Looks like Christmas.
-Well, you missed last call, boys. -Bullshit.
We're ripping this place a new asshole.
BIKER: Move or die.
I hope you don't me saying this, but...
You look hot.
There's no reason to leave anybody alive. Nobody's innocent.
And we can't leave anybody able to talk.
Don't go soft on me, kid. Don't leave anybody breathing.
I won't.
I'll work the perimeter and nail the guards.
Baby, you're a natural.
I'll work the inside.
How will I know when you're in?
You'll have a pretty good idea.
MARV: Damn thing misfired on me.
I nearly got them all.
But this piece of shit jammed up on me.
Piece of crap Uzi...had to get all stuck.
Here.
Take a seat.
You're a peach.
I got this.
You clever, clever little whore.
I can't believe you made it this far.
You know, Hartigan blew my son's pecker off.
So,
where shall I shoot you next?
That tight little belly of yours?
I'm holding a gun on you, young lady!
The rules are, you pretend there's a chance that I won't shoot you.
I told you, you would scream before you die.
I owe it to my son.
Frankly, between you and me,
I've finally accepted that Ethan was not...
Presidential material.
I'd have had a hard time buying him an election in an insane asylum.
But he was my son, honey.
He was my son.
And now...
He's gonna hear you scream.
Scream.
This is for John Hartigan,
fucker.
To the highest room of the tallest tower
where my princess awaits rescue from her handsome Prince Charming!
This is worse than Love Letters. I hate dinner theater!
Me too.
Whoa there, Chauncey!
Hark! The brave Prince Charming approacheth.
Fear not, fair maiden.
I shall slay the monster that guards you,
and then take my place as rightful King.
What did she say?
It's… it's Shrek!

I think that went pretty well.
Donkey! [grunts]
Come on now, Shrek!
Some people just don't understand boundaries.
Just think. A couple more days, and we'll be back home
in our vermin-filled shack strewn with fungus,
filled with the rotting stench of mud and neglect.
Oh, you had me at "vermin-filled."
And, uh… maybe, even the pitter-patter of little feet on the floor.

-Um, what if, theoretically… -Yeah? …they were little ogre feet?
Honey, let's try and be rational about this.
Have you seen a baby lately?
They just eat and poop, and they cry,
and then they cry when they poop, and they poop when they cry. Now, imagine an ogre baby.
Now, imagine an ogre baby.
They extra-cry, and they extra-poop.
Shrek, don't you ever think about having a family?
Right now, you're my family.
Well, somebody better be dying.
I'm dying.
-Harold? -[coughing continues]
Don't forget to pay the gardener, Lillian.
Of course, darling.
Fiona.
Yes, Daddy?
I know I've made many mistakes with you.
It's okay.

Yeah, Dad?
This kingdom needs a new King.
You and Fiona are next in line for the throne.
Next in line. Now, you see, Dad, that's why people love you.
Even on your deathbed, you're still making jokes.
Oh, come on, Dad. An ogre as King?
I… I don't think that's such a good idea.
I mean, there's gotta be somebody else. Anybody!
Aside from you, there is only one remaining heir.

[Charming] Ah, Mabel!
Why they call you an ugly stepsister, I'll never know.
Where's Doris? Taking the night off?
She's not welcome here, and neither are you.
What do you want, Charming?
Oh, not much. Just a chance at redemption.

Hi. Um, I don't know you, but I'd like to.
I gotta go!
I know. I know. I don't wanna leave you either, baby.
But you know how Shrek is. The dude's lost without me.
But don't worry. I'll send you airmail kisses every day!
All right, be strong, babies. Be strong.
All right, be strong, babies. Be strong. Now, Coco, Peanut, you listen to your mama, all right?
And Bananas, no more roasting marshmallows on your sister's head.
-[sneezes] -Aw, that's my special boy!
Oh, come over here, all of you! Give your daddy a big hug!
Shrek?
[chuckles nervously] Maybe you should just stay and be King.
Oh, come on. There's no way I could ever run a kingdom.
That's why your cousin Arthur is a perfect choice.
It's not that. No. It's… Well, see…
And if he gives me any trouble, I've always got persuasion and reason.
Here's persuasion, and here's reason.
Fiona,
soon it's just going to be you, me
and our swamp.
It's not going to be just you and me.
All aboard!
It will be. I promise.
[smooches] I love you.
[all] Aw!
-That's lovely. -Bye-bye, babies!
Shrek! Yeah?
-Wait! -What is it?
I'm… I'm…
[chuckles] I love you too, honey!
No! No, I said I'm…
You're what?
I said I'm pregnant!
What was that?
You're going to be a father!
That's great!
[Fiona] Really? I'm glad you think so!
I love you!
Yeah! [chuckles awkwardly]
Me too! You!
[Donkey] I'm going to be an uncle! I'm going to be an uncle!
I'm going to be an uncle!
[Puss] And you, my friend, are royally…
Home.
[Fiona] Shrek! Oh! [laughs]
Fiona!
Fiona?
-[cooing] -Oh, no.
Better out than in, I always say.
No, no, no, no!
-Ha, ha. No, no, no! -[crying] No. No, it's okay. It's gonna be all right.
No. No, it's okay. It's gonna be all right. -Dada! -Huh?
Hey! [shrieks] Stop! Hey, hey, wait!
[shrieks] Stop! Hey, hey, wait!
Whoa! Hey, hey. Oh, no. No!
No. No, no, no, no. No, no. [blows air] [exclaims] Hey! Hey!
[exclaims] Hey! Hey! -[ogre baby screaming] -[gasps]
-[pots shatter] -Oh, no. Hey, hey, wait. Would ya… Hey!
Oh! Donkey. Donkey! [Shrek] Wake up!
[in low voice] Dada!
Shrek! Shrek! Are you okay?
I can't believe I'm going to be a father. How did this happen?
Allow me to explain. You see, when a man has certain feelings for a woman,
a powerful urge sweeps over him.
I know how it happened.
I just can't believe it.
How does it happen?

an ice cold pitcher of mojitos and two weeks of nothing but… fishing. [clicking tongue]
Man, don't you listen to him!
Look, having a baby is not going to ruin your life.
It's not my life I'm worried about ruining, it's the kid's.
I mean, when have you ever heard the phrase "as sweet as an ogre,"
or "as nurturing as an ogre,"
or how about, "You're gonna love my dad. He's a real ogre"?
Okay. Okay. I get it.
Look, nobody said it was gonna be easy. But at least you got us to help you out.
That's true. [chuckles]
I'm doomed.
You'll be fine.
[ship captain] You're finished.
[splutters] Uh, with your journey.
"Wor-ces-ters-shiree"? Now that sounds fancy!
-It's Worcestershire. -Like the sauce?
-It's Worcestershire. -Like the sauce? Mmm. It's spicy!
Mmm. It's spicy!
Oh. They must be expecting us.
What in the shista-shire kind of place is this?
Well, my stomach aches, and my palms just got sweaty.
Well, my stomach aches, and my palms just got sweaty. -Must be a high school. -High school?
-Must be a high school. -High school?
-Ready? -[all] Okay!
Wherefore art thou headed, to the top?
Yeah, we think so! We think so!
And dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped?
[cheerleaders] Nay, we thinkst not! We thinkst not!
[driving instructor] All right, Mr. Percival, just ease up on the reins. -[boy screams] -[carriage crashes]
[coughs] For lo, bro, don't burn all my frankincense and myrrh.
I'm already starting to feel nauseous from memories of wedgies and swirlies!
But how did you receive the wedgies
when you are clearly not a wearer of the underpants?
Let's just say some things are better left unsaid and leave it at that.
So then I was all like, "I'd rather get the black plague
and lock myself in an iron maiden than go out with you." -Oh, totally. -Pardon me.
-Oh, totally. -Pardon me. [groans] Totally ew-eth.
[groans] Totally ew-eth. Yeah, totally.
I just altered my character level to plus three superb-ability.
Hi. We're looking for someone named…
Gee, who rolled a plus nine dork spell
and summoned the beast and his quadrupeds?
I know you're busy not fitting in,
but can either of you tell me where I can find Arthur?
He's over there.
There is no sweeter taste on thy tongue than victory!
Strong, handsome, face of a leader.
Does Arthur look like a King or what? -[boy groans] -Oh?
-Sorry. -[boy groans]
[boy] Did you just say you were looking for Arthur?
That information is on a need-to-know basis.
It's top secret! Hushity-hush!
Now, gentlemen, let's away. To the showers! -[horse neighs] -[thuds]
Greetings, Your Majesty. This is your lucky day.
So what, for like, are you supposed to be? Some kind of giant, mutant leprechaun or something?
Some kind of giant, mutant leprechaun or something?
Giant mutant… You made a funny. [groans] Unhand me, monster!
[groans] Unhand me, monster!
Stop squirming, Arthur.
I'm not Arthur.
I am Lancelot.
That dork over there is Arthur.
[Shrek] Hey!
[clears throat] This is, like, totally embarrassing,
but my friend Tiffany thinkest thou vex her so soothly.
And she thought perchance thou would wanna ask her to the Homecoming Dance or something.
-Uh, excuse me? -It's like, whatever.
-Uh, excuse me? -It's like, whatever. She's just totally into college guys, and mythical creatures, and stuff.
Oh, Arthur,
come out, come out, wherever you are! -[thudding] -[indistinct shouting]
Yeah, you better run, you little punk no-goodniks!
'Cause the days of little Donkey Dumpy Drawers are over!
Ah, hold it.
-Uh, we're here for the Mascot Contest. -[imitates monster growling]
-[door closes] -Uh… We're here for the Mascot Contest too.
[scoffs] This is a costume?
Worked on it all night long.
[sighs] Looks pretty real to me.
If he were real, could I do this? [groans] Ow…
-Or this? -[Shrek groaning]
If it were real, that would have been agonizingly painful.
-Now watch this! -That's quite enough, boys.
Thank you to Professor Primbottom and his invigorating lecture
on "How to just say nay."
And now, without further ado,
let's give a warm Worcestershire hoozah
to the winner of our new Mascot Contest, the…
-[crowd gasps] -Ogre?
That's right. I'm the new mascot. So let's really try and beat the other guys
So let's really try and beat the other guys
at whatever it is they're doing!
This is all indeed a bit unorthodox…
Now, where can I find Arthur Pendragon?
[Artie] Hey, wait…
Classic.
You should be ashamed of yourself!
I didn't do it. They did.
Please don't eat me.
[crowd chanting] Eat him! Eat him! Eat him! Eat him!
I'm not here to eat him!
It's time to pack up your toothbrush and jammies.
You're the new King of Far Far Away.
What?
Artie, a King? More like the Mayor of Loservillel
[boy] Burn.
Is this for real?
Absolutely. Now clean out your locker, kid. You've got a kingdom to run.
Now clean out your locker, kid. You've got a kingdom to run.
So, wait. I'm really the only heir?
The one and only.
Give me, uh, just a second.
My good people,
I think there's a lesson here for all of us.
Maybe the next time you're about to dunk a kid's head in a chamber pot,
Maybe the next time you're about to dunk a kid's head in a chamber pot, you'll stop and think, "Hey, maybe this guy has feelings.
you'll stop and think, "Hey, maybe this guy has feelings.
Maybe I should cut him some slack.
'Cause maybe, just maybe,
this guy's gonna turn out to be, I don't know, a King.
And maybe his first royal decree
will be to banish everyone who ever picked on him."
That's right. I'm looking at you, jousting team!
And Gwen…
[Artie] Oh, Gwen.
I've always loved you.
Well, good friends, it breaks my heart, but…
enjoy your stay here in prison while I rule the free world, baby!
All right, let's not overdo it.
[Artie] I'm building my city, people, on rock 'n' roll!
-You just overdid it. -[Artie] Ow!
-[Cinderella] Darling! -[Snow White] Oh! -Look at you! -Wow!
-You look darling. -Oh, just precious. Look at her.
So, have you had any cravings since you've been pregnant?
[munching] No. Not at all.
[sniffing] Do you smell ham? [clapping] Ooh! It's present time!
Oh, Fiona, won't you please open mine first? It's, it's… it's the one in front.
"Congratulations on your new mess maker…" Oh, "mess maker!" [chuckles]
"Hopefully, this helps. Love, Cinderella."
-Would you look at that! -What is it?
It's for the poopies. Ew!
-Wait. Babies poop? -Everyone poops, Beauty.
-[pig 1] Fiona! -[pig 2] Fiona! We all chipped in for a little present too.
We all chipped in for a little present too. -Yeah! -[drum roll]
You know the baby's gonna love it, because I do!
Oh, you guys, that's so sweet. Thank you.
Who's this one from?
I got you the biggest one, because I love you the most.
"Have one on me. Love, Snow White."
Um, what is it? [laughs] He's a live-in babysitter.
-Where's the baby? -[Fiona chuckles]
You're… you're too kind, Snow, but I… I can't accept this.
Oh. Think nothing of it. I've got six more at home.
-What does he do? -The cleaning.
-The feeding. -The burping.
So, what are Shrek and I supposed to do?
Well, now you'll have plenty of time to work on your marriage. [scoffs] Gee. Thanks, Rapunzel,
[scoffs] Gee. Thanks, Rapunzel, and what's that supposed to mean?
Oh, come on now, Fiona. -You know what happens. -[snores, gasps]
You're tired all the time.
You'll start letting yourself go.
Stretchmarks.
Say goodbye to romance.
[awkward chuckle] I'm sorry, but uh, how many of you have kids?
She's right!
A baby is only gonna strengthen the love that Shrek and Fiona have.
How did Shrek react when you told him? Tell me.
Well, when he first found out, Shrek said…
Onward, my new friends! To our happily ever afters!
-[man grunts] -[evil laughing]
Now, bombs away!
Well, well, well. If it isn't Peter Pan.
-His name's not Peter. -Shut it, Wendy.
-[grunts] -[glass shatters]
Enough pillaging! To the castle!
You go and take care of the baby!
Everybody stay calm! We're all gonna die!
Everyone in! Now!
Come on! Put some back into it, people. -Yee-haw! -[thuds]
We don't have time. Now, go!
Quickly, ladies!
-We'll hold them off as long as we can! -[thuds]
-[all slurping] -Where are Shrek and Fiona?
-The name doesn't ring a bell. -Yeah, no bell.
I suggest you freaks cooperate
with the new King of Far Far Away!
The only thing you're ever gonna be King of
is King of the Stupids!
Hook! [snaps fingers] Right!
Avast, ye cookie.

I can't believe it. Me, a King?
I-I… I mean, I knew I came from royalty and all, but… I just figured everyone forgot about me.

Oh, no. In fact, the King asked for you personally.
Really? Wow.
Look, I know it's not all gonna be fun and games.
It really is all fun and games, actually.
Sure, you have to knight a few heroes, launch a ship or two.
By the way, make sure you hit the boat just right with the bottle.
Boat with a bottle. Any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle.
Well, I've heard it's harder than it looks.
Whoa! This is gonna be huge.
Parties, princesses, castles. Princesses.
It's gonna be great, Artie. You'll be living in the lap of luxury.
They got the finest chefs around waiting for you to place your order.
And fortunately, you'll have the royal food tasters.
Oh, yeah? What do they do?
They taste the food before the King eats to make sure it's not, uh, poisoned.
-Poisoned? -Or too salty.
Don't worry about it. You'll be safe and sound with the help of your bodyguards.

I said King! You're gonna be King!
[imitates Shrek] "You're gonna be King!" Yeah, right.
Where do you think you're going?

You get back here, young man, and I mean it.
Uh, boss? I don't think he's coming back.
Maybe it's for the best. He's not exactly King material.
When were you planning on telling him that you were really supposed to be King?
Oh, come on. Now why would I do that?
Besides, he'll be ten times better at it than me.
Hey, whoa, Shrek. Then you're gonna have to change your tactics if you want to get anywhere with this kid.
You're right, Donkey.
What about this?
-Shrek! -Oh, come on. It's just a joke.
Still…
Listen, Artie. Uh…

What we need are directions back to Far Far Away.
What's with the "we"? Who said I was going with you?
Oh, I did. 'Cause there's a lot of people counting on you,
so don't try and weasel out of it.
If it's such a great job, why don't you do it?
Understand this, kid. It's no more Mr. Nice Guy from here on out.
Oh! So that was your Mr. Nice Guy?
I know, and I'm gonna miss him.
You know what? Why don't you go terrorize a village and leave me alone!
Oh, was that some kind of crack about ogres?
You get your royal highness to Far Far Away
before I kick it there! Now, which way am I kicking?
Oh, I could tell you, but since you're in the midst of a self destructive rage spiral,
it would be karmically irresponsible.
Self destructive… Look, are you gonna help us or not?
Most definitely, but only after you
take the journey to your soul!
-Yeah, I don't think so. -Look, pal.
-Yeah, I don't think so. -Look, pal. It's either that or some primal scream therapy.
All right. All right. Journey to the soul.
Now, all of you, look into the Fire of Truth
and tell me what you see. Ha!
Ooh, charades!
Okay, I see a… a… a Dutch fudge torte with cinnamon swirls!
Okay, monster, go for it.
I see a rainbow pony.
-Excellent work! Now the boy. -This is lame.
-Excellent work! Now the boy. -This is lame. -Ow! -You're lame! Just go for it.
Okay.
There's a baby bird and a father bird sitting in a nest. -[rhythmic drum beating] -Yes! Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it!
-[rhythmic drum beating] -Yes! Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it!
Wait. The dad just flew away.
Why did he leave the little bird all alone?
It's trying to fly, but it doesn't know how to.
-[drum beating intensifies] -It's… it's gonna fall!
Whew! Proper head case you are, aren't you? [chuckles] Really messed up. Whoa!
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I get it. The bird's me. My dad left.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I get it. The bird's me. My dad left. So what?
Look, Artie, um…
Just thought I might help set the mood,
you know, for your big heart-to-heart chat.
I know what it's like to not feel ready for something.
Even ogres get scared.
You know, once in a while.
I know you want me to be King, but I can't.
I'm not cut out for it, and I never will be, all right?
[Artie] Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth the trouble.
He dumped me at that school the first chance he got, and I never heard from him again.
and I never heard from him again.
My dad wasn't really the fatherly type, either.
Well, I doubt he was worse than mine.
Oh, yeah?
My father was an ogre. He tried to eat me.
Now I guess I should have seen it coming.
He used to give me a bath in barbecue sauce
and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.
Okay, I guess that's pretty bad.
You know, it may be hard to believe,
what, with my obvious charm and good looks,
but people used to think I was a monster.
And for a long time, I believed them.
But after a while,
you learn to ignore the names that people call you, and you just trust who you are.
and you just trust who you are.
You know, you're okay, Shrek.
You just need to do a little less yelling and use a little more soap.
Thanks, Artie.
The soap's because you stink… really bad.
[Shrek] Yeah, I got that.
[Cinderella sniffing] Oh, this place is filthy!
I feel like a hobo.
I'm sorry, but this just isn't working for me.
Everything's always about you, isn't it?
It's not like your attitude is helping, Snow.
Well, maybe it just bothers you that I was voted fairest in the land.
Oh. You mean in that rigged election?
Oh, give me a break. "Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down thy golden extensions!"
Ladies, let go of your petty complaints, and let's work together!
[Snow White] So, I guess the plan is we just wander aimlessly
in this stinkhole until we rot.
No, we're gonna get inside and find out what Charming's up to.
I know he's a jerk and everything,
but I gotta admit that Charming makes me hotter than July.
[gasps] That's it!
[Rapunzel] Come on! This way! Rapunzel, wait!
Charming, let go of her.
But why would I want to do that?
Wh-What?
Say hello, ladies, to the new Queen of Far Far Away.
Rapunzel, how could you?
Jealous much?
Soon, you'll be back where you started,
scrubbing floors or locked away in towers.
That is, if I let you last the week.
But… pookie, you promised you wouldn't hurt them.
Not here, kitten whiskers. Daddy will discuss it later.
Now, forgive us. We have a show to put on.
Shrek will be back soon, Charming, and you'll be sorry.
Sorry?
Don't you realize once Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away,
he's doomed?
Look out! They got a piano!
Kill them all, except the fat one.
King Charming has something special in mind for you, ogre.
King Charming?
Attack!

She's gonna get what's coming to her.
And there ain't nothing you can do to stop him!
-We've got to save her. -But she's so far far away!
Get yourself back to Worcestershire, kid.
No, Shrek. Hold on a second. I've got an idea.
I'm a buzzing bee. Buzz, buzz, buzz…
Mr. Merlin? They need a spell to get them…
[splutters] …I mean us, back to Far Far Away.
Forget it. I don't have that kind of magic in me anymore, kid.
How about a hug instead? Hmm? That's the best kind of magic.
Mr. Merlin, please. I know you can do it.
I said, forget it! [grumbles]
But…
What… what's with you?
It's just so hard, you know?
They really need to get back, 'cause their kingdom's in trouble.
'Cause there's a really bad man.
And it's just so hard!
-Come on. Take it easy. -[sobbing]
No! I don't think you understand!
There's a mean person doing mean things to good people.
Oh, have a heart, old man.
And they really need your help to get them back.
So why won't you help them? -Oh. -[mumbling]
-[sobbing] -Okay.
I'll go and get my things.
-Piece of cake. -Well, well, well.
-Piece of cake. -Well, well, well. You want some eggs with that ham?
Now, um… I am a little rusty, so there could be some side effects.
-Side effects? -[Merlin] Don't worry. Whatever it is, no matter how excruciatingly painful it may be,
Whatever it is, no matter how excruciatingly painful it may be,
it will wear off eventually. I think.
-Oops. -Are you sure this is a good idea?
Look, if Artie trusts him, that's good enough for me.
Even if his robe doesn't quite cover his…
Alacritous expeditious,
a-zoomy-zoom-zoom!
[Merlin] Let's help our friends get back…
soon!
It worked!
[in Donkey's voice] Man, I haven't been on a trip like that since college!
Donkey?
What? Is there something in my teeth?
What the… Oh, no! I've been abracadabra-ed into a Fancy Feasting, second rate sidekick!

-[clattering] -Quick, Pinocchio. Where is Fiona?
Charming's got her locked away someplace secret. You gotta find him!
He's probably getting ready for the show!
Wait, wait, wait, Pinocchio! What show?
[in Puss's voice] "It's a Happily Ever After After All."
"Shrek's final performance"?
[in Donkey's voice] Whoa, Shrek! You didn't tell us you were in a… a play!
Well, I guess I've been so busy I forgot to mention it.
[guard 1] It's the ogre! Get him!
[in Puss's voice] Don't worry, jefe. I got this.
[guard 2] Ugh! Kill it!
Look. Don't you know who he thinks he is? -[Artie] How dare you! -Donkey, we're dealing with amateurs.
-[Artie] How dare you! -Donkey, we're dealing with amateurs.
He's a star, people! Hello? I'm so sorry about this, Mr. Shrek.
I'm gonna lose it!
I assume you have everything ready for tonight? You did get the list for the dressing room?
[in Donkey's voice] Yeah, the breakfast croissant stuffed with seared sashimi tuna.
Oh, and please tell me you at least have the saffron corn with jalapeño honey butter.
'Cause our client cannot get into his proper emotional state
without his jalapeño honey butter!
I just lost it.
[guard 1] Oh. Uh… [guard 3] Maybe they should talk to Nancy in Human Resources.
[in Puss's voice] Oh, we have much to say to Nancy, I promise!
[Charming] "With this sword, I do…" No. "With…
With this sword, I do smote thee!"
Is that the right word? "Smote"? "Smoot"?
I don't think that's even a word, actually.
Maybe I should just "smite" him. Let's try this again. Now…
Shrek attacks me. I pretend to be afraid. Ooh!
I say, "Finally, the kingdom will get the happily ever after they deserve,
-die Ogre…" -[man groans] …blah, blah, blah. Oh, it just doesn't feel real enough yet!
…blah, blah, blah. Oh, it just doesn't feel real enough yet! -[grunts] -[sword clangs]
Who told you to stop dancing? Uh… Wink and turn.
Uh… Wink and turn.
What are you laying around for? Get up! Honestly!
Our happily ever after is nearly complete, Mommy.
And I assure you,
the people of this kingdom will pay dearly for every second
we've had to wait.
-[gasps] -[Shrek] Break a leg.
Or on second thought, let me break it for you.
Thank goodness you're here. I was beginning to think you might not make it back in time.
Where's Fiona?
Don't worry. She and the others are safe, for now.
Hmm. Let me guess. Arthur.
It's Artie, actually.
This boy is supposed to be the new King of Far Far Away?
How pathetic.
[Charming] Now stand still, so I won't make a mess.
Charming, stop! I'm here now. You got what you wanted.
This isn't about him.
Then… then, who's it about? I'm supposed to be King, right?
You weren't really next in line for the throne, okay?
I was.
But you said the King asked for me personally.
-Not exactly. -What's that supposed to mean?
Look, I said whatever I had to say, all right?
I wasn't right for the job. I just needed some fool to replace me.
And you fit the bill. So… so just go!
You were playing me the whole time.
You catch on real fast, kid.
Maybe you're not as big of a loser as l thought.
You know, for a minute there,
-I actually thought you… -[Charming] What?
That he cared about you? He's an ogre.
What did you expect?
You really do have a way with children, Shrek.
♪ No ♪ [Snow White] Had we just stayed put like I suggested,
we could be sipping tea out of little heart-shaped cups.
Yeah, yeah, heart-shaped cups. [laughing]
And eating crumpets smothered with loganberries.
Yeah, loganberries.
-Shut up, Cindy. -Yeah, shut up.
-No, you shut up. -[Cinderella] Ha! Just stay out of this.
Who cares who's "running the kingdom" anyway?
[chuckles] I care. -And you should all care too. -[keys jingling]
-[Donkey in Puss's voice] Hey, hey, hey. -[Puss in Donkey's voice] Ow! Whoa!
Yeah, and I have your badge number, tin can!
-[Fiona] Donkey? -[in Donkey's voice] Princess!
-Puss? -[speaking Spanish]
[in Puss's voice in English] But I am Puss, stuck here inside this hideous body.
-[in Donkey's voice] And I'm me! -But you're…
I know, I know. Everything's a little fruity in the loops right now, but what happened is…
we went to high school, and the boat crashed,
and we got bippity-boppity-booped by the magic man.
[groans] You poor, sweet things.
[whispers] I don't get it.
The cat turned into a little horse that smells like feet. What's to get?
-Huh? Who dat? -Where's Shrek?
Charming's got him, Princess, and he plans on killing Shrek tonight in front of the whole kingdom!
All right, everyone. -We need to find a way out now. -You're right.
-We need to find a way out now. -You're right. Ladies, assume the position!
What are you doing?
Waiting to be rescued. [snores]
You've gotta be kidding me.
Well, what do you expect us to do? We're just four…
I mean three, super hot princesses,
two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre and an old lady!
Hmm. Excuse me. Old lady coming through.
Mom!
Well, you didn't actually think you got your fighting skills from your father, did you?
Excuse me. I think there's still one more.
Why don't you just lie down?
Okay, girls, from here on out,
we're gonna take care of business ourselves.

Hi, honey.
[Fiona] Sorry we're late. You okay?
[chuckles softly] Much better, now that you're here. [crowd] Aw!
So, Charming, you wanna let me out of these
so we can settle this ogre to man?
Ooh, that sounds fun. But I have a better idea.
-Fiona! -No! Let go of me!
You will not ruin things this time, ogre. Kill it.
[Artie] Everybody, stop!
Oh, what is it now? Artie?
Who really thinks we need to settle things this way?
You're telling me you just wanna be villains your whole lives?
But we are villains! It's the only thing we know.
Didn't you ever wish you could be something else?
Well, it's easy for you to say. You're not some evil enchanted tree.
Oh, you morons! Don't listen to him! Attack them!
What Steve's trying to say here is it's hard to come by honest work
-when the whole world's against you. -[muffled groan]
Right. Thanks, Ed.
Okay. Fair enough. You're right. I'm not a talking tree.
But you know, a good friend of mine once told me
that just because people treat you like a villain, or an ogre,
or just some loser…
…it doesn't mean you are one.
The thing that matters most is what you think of yourself.
If there's something you really want, or someone you really wanna be,
then the only person standing in your way is you. -Me? -Get him, lads.
-Me? -Get him, lads.
-[villains] Yeah! -[Artie] No, no, no, no, no!
Wh-What I mean is… each of you
is standing in your own way.

Um, you're gonna feel a little pinch and possibly some lower intestinal discomfort,
but this should do the trick.

Oops.
Ah, never mind.

Now you can't…
You can't move too good. Huh?

I must be the motherfucking genius of sick, you know?

That's like some Shakespeare or some shit.
Whoo! Damn, you knocked this dude out pretty good.
About to get you a spot on the Dodgers, son. Yeah.
Maybe you don't understand what just happened.
I just fucking killed you.
You try not to embarrass yourself because you're on Candid Camera!
Ohh! What is this shit right here I gave you? This is some high-tech,
This is some high-tech, sci-fi, Chinese [whoops] synthetic bullshit!
I don't exactly know what the fuck is in this shit, dude.
All I know is that, once this shit has binded with your blood cells…
You're fucked, baby, and believe me, it's done binded.
Yeah, you got yourself about an hour, max. Tick-tock.
This shit has been real. You probably should've thought twice before you whacked Don Kim.
You're experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight right about now, ain't you?
You know what? Thought so.
Now you have yourself a nice death.
Asshole.
You like that, huh? Home run.
[woman] Hey, this is Eve. I'm glad you called, but I'm not here.
Uh, can you leave a message? Unless you're trying to sell something, because I'm not interested, but…
If you're not, then just… Oh! Wait.
Aah! -Time's up. -[machine beeps]
Get a cell phone, honey. Please?
Come on, come on, come on.
Dr. Miles' office. May I help you?
Yeah, let me speak to him.
I'm sorry, but the doctor isn't in right now. May I take a message?
Well, where is he? I beg your pardon, sir?
Where… the fuck… is he?
No. Yeah!
Ohh! Where you from? Ah!
I don't know, sir. This is his answering service.
Jesus fucking Christ. Would you like for me to have him paged?
Yeah, fine.
Could you please let the doctor know that Chev Chelios is a dead man
if he can't call me back within the hour. You got that? Could you spell that for me?
Yeah, D-E-A-D. Chelios.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Hello. Kaylo, my man. Where were you last night?
Oh, what's up, Chev? I said, where were you last night?
I, uh…
Yeah, yeah, well, you want to know what I was doing? What?
Getting killed, you plum. What?
Yeah, you heard me. -Ricky fucking Verona. -Ricky Verona?
-Ricky fucking Verona. -Ricky Verona? I mean, who'd have thought…
That little bitch would have the stones to come and whack me in my own crib.
I mean, it's inconceivable. And yet, here we are. Where are we?
I'm dead, and you're simple.
Now you listen to me. You put the word out I'm looking for Ricky Verona.
Anyone sees him, you call me. -You understand that? -I…
I'm going to get that little fucker if it's the last thing I do.
It may actually be the last thing I do. You understand that?
Ricky Verona. -Copy me on that, Kaylo? -Yeah!
Find him!
-[man] Hey, man! -Get up! What the fuck you doing? What the fuck you doing?
Where am I going? Fuck you, man. Chevy!
Man, the bathroom don't work, brother. What you doing?
Yo, Chevy, what the-- Where's Verona?
I'm talking. What are we talking about?
Don't fuck with me! Ok, man. Nobody's fucking with you, man. Just calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down, motherfucker!
-Fuck, man! -[banging on door] [man] Orlando, you all right?
Hey! There's a white nigga with a gun up in here.
So just, just be still, motherfuckers!
Now, you see that? You see that? I'm trying to help you here, man.
Look, I got to find Ricky Verona.
Why the fuck would I know where Ricky Verona is? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't know where he is, but you're going to tell me where he is.
Or I'm going to blow your brains through the fucking toilet! Come on, man!
I'm going to kill him!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Put your guns down. The white man is cool.
Hey! The white man is-- The white man is cool!
Y'all like them Somalia niggas.
Now, look, Chevy came here because he has something he would like to discuss.
And we going to discuss this shit in a civilized manner. Chevy?
I believe you had a question, or some point that you were trying to make.
Where's Verona?
Ok. I'm not affiliated with Ricky Verona.
You pulled the Anselmo job together.
-Don't try to fucking bullshit me! -[all yelling]
Easy! Easy! Easy!
All right?
Look, clearly you're operating under a false pretense, all right? Because Ricky Verona and myself did not pull
the Anselmo job together. In fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the Anselmo job.
In fact, Ricky Verona still owes me $7,500.
Not the way I heard it. Yeah, but that's the way it is.
That's the way it is. So, you see, I don't know where Ricky Verona is because if I knew where Ricky Verona was
because if I knew where Ricky Verona was I'd probably be there right now, beating the Gucci off his ass.
All right.
[Orlando] All right.
That's what I'm talking about. [voice fading] That's almost civilized.
Shit, dude, what's the matter with you?
Just give me some coke, ok? You got any coke? Okay, so now you're just gonna
come up in here and insult me.
Come on, I don't have time!
Just give me something.
I'm really dying here. I can see that.
You don't understand. I'm really fucking dying!
You saying this is medicinal-use coke? Is that what you're saying? That's right.
What? The shit ain't free, nigga.
That's enough.
What, you going to do the shit right here?
Chevy, come on, man!
Oh, God.
Chevy.
Oh, what the--
Oh, that's good. Oh, that's good. That's good, right?
Why you looking for Verona anyway, man?
Seems like some Chinese assholes hired him to kill me.
So this is about the Don Kim situation. What do you know about it?
I know you pulled the trigger. Of course I pulled the trigger.
Why wouldn't I pull the fucking trigger?
Well… Yo, Chelios. You good?
This shit ain't working. I beg your pardon?
I think I know what I have to do.
Oh, well, shit, you know. A man's got to do what a man's got to do.
What is it you got to do? I got to kick some Black ass.
-What? -Aah!
Oh, shit! There he goes again.
Who wants white meat?

What the fuck you doing out there? Coming for you, asshole, fucking believe me!
Coming for you, asshole, fucking believe me! Yo, whatever, dude. I'll be waiting for you.
Yo, whatever, dude. I'll be waiting for you. You ain't going to make it, though, motherfucker.
Look, I just thought you should know that I'm all about hooking up with that little mystery girl that you been banging.

What? Yeah, you got to fucking do something for me, Doc. -I'm telling you now. -What are your symptoms?
-I'm telling you now. -What are your symptoms? It's like, uh, like I'm slowing down. You know, I'm caught in a tar pit.
You know, I'm caught in a tar pit. -Blurred vision? -Yeah.
-Blurred vision? -Yeah. -Dizzy? -Sure.
-Any pain in your chest? -Not really.
-Any pain in your chest? -Not really. Actually, I'm feeling pretty good right now.
What are you doing?
Driving through a mall. Cops chasing me.
The flow of adrenaline's what's keeping you alive.
I'm having a little trouble hearing you, Doc.
You got to keep moving, Chevy.
Explain.
If I'm right, they gave you the Beijing cocktail.
It's very nasty shit.
It works on the adrenal gland, blocks its receptors.
In fact, the only thing you can do to slow it down at all is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant.
is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant.
-Meaning, if you stop, you die. -Hang on.
Jesus, what was…
Are you there? Are you ok?
What'd you say, Doc?
If you stop… you die.
That's what I'm trying to do. Keep moving. Keep the blood pumping.
Chevy, you there? Chevy?
Every time I slow down, it's, uh… It's like my veins start to rust.
Have you taken anything? A couple of grams of coke.
Well, that's a start, huh, Chevy? Look, I'll be in L.A. In about an hour.
I'll call you as soon as I get there, but do not stop moving. Keep yourself pumped up.

Word travels fast.
Listen, Carlito. I need your help. I don't have a lot of time.
No. Not much.
You got to find an antidote, something.
What's the matter? The shit they gave you.
It's the Chinese shit.
There is no antidote.
What, that's it? Honestly… you should be dead already.
Honestly… you should be dead already.
It's a miracle. A miracle?
We give that shit to horses.
You don't have to be so damn fucking cool about it!
What do you expect me to do, hmm? Tell me you're going to find that punk Verona
and his whole fucking crew and feed him to a cage of wolverines.
What is this?
What, are you boys now or something?
Verona?
That's a small-time punk.
But that's not to say there isn't an opportunity here. Opportunity.
Everyone knows the love I have for you, Chev.
Maybe this makes up for the Don Kim hit, which was…
uh, perhaps ill-advised. Ill-advised?
The heat from Hong Kong has been much more than we anticipated.
Well, that's outstanding, Carlito.
I'm glad to know that my death can be of some fucking use to you.
Don't be difficult. I'm not being difficult.
I don't know if you'd noticed,
but I'm having a difficult fucking day, brother!
Aah! I'm out of here.
Ah, you're not getting in my cab wet.
I just gave you $200 to wait for three minutes.
You're not getting in my car. No way!
Yeah, you're right. I'm not getting in your cab.
Oh, fuck! Al-Qaeda! Al-Qaeda!
[driver yelling] I love America! I love Bush!
Yeah. Hey, Chev.
My flight's been delayed. Shit. No, no, it's all right. Relax.
I mean, don't relax. Listen to me.
That shit that they gave you is cutting off your adrenaline.
Excitement, fear, danger.
It causes your body to manufacture a chemical called ephedrine.
Now, what these guys have done is introduce an inhibitor to your system.
Fuck's sake! Dude, your only chance is to massively increase
the level of ephedrine in your body to force out the inhibitors.
You got to get to the emergency room. Get yourself some epinephrine. It's an artificial adrenaline.
It comes in ten-milligram syringes.
The shit's potent, so don't overdo it. Probably a fifth of an injection will do.
Chevy, did you get that?
Did you get that, Chevy? Yeah, epi-something, yeah. Nephrine, man. Epi-ne-phrine.
Ok, ok, ok, I've got it. I got to go.
I'll call you when I get there.
Yeah. [Kaylo] Chev?
Yeah?

Want to hold hands?
Hey, talk to me, bro. Hey, Ricky.
What do you think about sucking me off? You in the mood?
Maybe let me lick your ass or something?
Who is this? Shit. Chelios?
Is this fucking Chelios? That's right, bro.
Want to guess how I got your brother's cell phone?
I can tell you have it all figured out.
Looks like you should have cut me up when you had the chance.
I'm having a little trouble hearing you, Ricky.
Are you experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight?
You're supposed to be fucking dead!
You know, I kind of like that shit you put in me.
Can you get me some more?
-I'm gonna f-- -Oh, I know. I know. I know.
Hey. What's this?
A necklace. You guys really are faggots, aren't you?
You motherfucker! You fucking motherfucker! My grandfather gave that medallion
to my father, and then he…
Fuck!
Fuck you, man. You take that thing and you shove it up your ass.
No, thanks.
You know, I believe I'll hang on to it.
Looks like you'll have to come find me after all.
Fucked up that you killed your own brother. You--
What was that shit? Epi… Was it ten milligrams?
Good work, Kaylo.
Puta!
Asshole! No need to push.
I'm looking for something starts with "E."
England?
Very funny. No. Some kind of artificial adrenaline.
Artificial adrenaline. Yeah. Got heart problems.
Epinephrine. Yes! Epinephrine.
I love you. Epinephrine.
I can't give you epinephrine.
Why?
Just a minute.
Oy! What do you mean you--
What is this shit? Nasal spray.
Fucking miserable bitch. What?
Nasal spray. It's got epinephrine in it.
It'll get you tweaked, man.
-[Officer] Are you sure that's the guy? -[nurse] Yeah.
This room's clear.
[woman over PA] Could anyone speaking Korean please come to E.R.?
Anyone speaking Korean please come to E.R.
Dude, stop!
Stop!
[man] Hey, jerkoff!
Coming through!
I know you motherfuckers have epinephrine!
[man] Clear the hallway! -Corner! -Is the O.R. ready?
I'm having a really bad day. Oh, shit!
Tell me you've got epinephrine on this fucking cart.
-What? -You all right?
I said, "Tell me you've got epinephrine
on the cart," motherfucker! I don't know! I could check.
All right. Ok. [man] Get back!
You understand fucking English?
I understand English. I just don't know which one of these drawers it's in.
Come on! Move!
Give me the fucking epinephrine!
-All right! -Around the corner! I don't know where it is, man!
What is this, a rest home? What are you doing back there?
-Hurry up! -He's in shock!
Get back!
Well? I don't know if I have it. Give me a second here.
I'm looking.
Elevator! What the fuck? Where the fuck is it?
-My cart! -What the hell? What?
My cart! Yeah, yeah.
[Officer] Drop your weapon now!
What is this? What the hell do you think you're doing? This is a hospital.
do you think you're doing? This is a hospital. Shut up. You! Get me the epinephrine.
Shut up. You! Get me the epinephrine.
Don't even think about it!
Albuterol, Nexium, lower tab--
Epinephrine! Here it is. I got it.
Here you go. Give me that shit.
Asshole. I'm not gonna tell you again.
[woman] …just be quiet.
Juice me.
Juice?
Do it.
All right. Come on!
-Okay, okay. -I haven't got all day.
Ok. I need both of them to… Give it to me.
One…
Two… Clear.
Get the fuck down!
Get out!
How much of this stuff did he say to take?
-Chevy. -[Chelios] Yep. Hey, we're in the air, man.
Did you get that stuff I told you to get? Got it.
-Did you take it? -Took it.
You took the whole goddamn thing, didn't you?
-Yep. -I said a fifth of a syringe. That shit's gonna kill you.
-Right. -Your chest on fire?
-Check. -But you're cold. Check.
And you got a steel hard-on, don't you? Let me check.
-Check. -Yeah, well, that, that's the stimulation of your blood vessels.
Your urinary sphincter's as tight as a knot right now. You couldn't piss to save your life.
Urinary sphincter. Check.
Maybe you can get some Vicodin. You still at that hospital? Negative.
Could you get some grass? I don't know. Check.
That shit'll be out of your system in 30 minutes
if it doesn't kill you first.
This flight phone's costing me a fortune. We'll be in L.A. In 20 minutes. I'll call you when we land.
Copy.
Hey, Chevy? You're a good dude. Been nice knowing you.
Copy. Out.
Some medical emergency.
[Reporter on TV] Police have declined to release the name of the Los Angeles man they say is still at large
of the Los Angeles man they say is still at large
on a citywide rampage that has left one man dead, dozens injured
and hundreds of thousands of dollars of property damage
in its smoking, bloody wake.
However, KTLA News has learned the suspect is a professional killer
with ties to organized crime and an extensive police record.
He is considered armed and highly dangerous.
We want to get you back to our regularly scheduled programming,
but keep it tuned right here to KTLA for continuing coverage of this bizarre story as it unfolds.
[man on TV] So, what you're saying, Mark, is that next to olives, onions, lemons, and limes…
Oh, shit! Look, take it easy, mister.
Get back, pig!
No-- No-- Just give me the--
Come on, then. Let's see you run, piggy.
Come on, piggy.
Give me the gun back. Let's just talk this over.
Hey, you want it? There!
[man] Honey, let's go! [woman] Be careful!
We'll get some help, all right?
Yeah.
Hey, did you try to call?
-You've been home all day? -[laughs]
I was sleeping in. You were sleeping in. That's great, Eve.
Super-great.
-Mm-hmm. -You all rested now? Mm-hmm. Glad to hear it.
Listen… I've been fatally poisoned. There's probably a psychopath heading over
There's probably a psychopath heading over there to torture and kill you as we speak,
but don't bother getting out of bed. I'll be there in a flash.
Maybe you can fry me up a waffle or something, ok?
Sure. Yeah, come on over. I'll be here. Right. You'll be there.
Right. You'll be there. -Ok. -[kissing] Bye.
-Ok. -[kissing] Bye.
So let's go get the bitch.
Come on! Please!
All right! All right! Jesus.
Oh, my God.
Is this your new look or something? Yeah. You into it?
It's gross.
Are you looking for my other boyfriend?
[gasps] Yes!
You haven't turned on the TV today, right? No, why?
Didn't think so. Come on. We're leaving.
What are you talking about? Don't be such a freak.
Honey. Get dressed.
Actually, I'm glad you're here. Can you change the clock on my microwave?
I never changed it back.
-What? -The microwave. Can you change the clock?
Can you change the clock? 'cause the daylight savings time
'cause the daylight savings time and I never changed it back.
The microwave. Yes.
Hey, listen. I bought you some flowers. They got fucked up on the way over here.
Oh, that's sweet. Are you ok?
You look like you're on drugs or something.
Listen. You love me, yeah?
Yes.
Then I need you to do something for me.
What? What's wrong?
I need you to put some clothes on, sweetheart, and come with me right now.
Yeah. No. I'll change the clock on the microwave.
Ok. -Yeah. -All right.
The shit's wearing off.
Oh, darn. I forgot. The waffle iron is on if you want to make one.
Great.
Great.
You're so stressed out. Do you want some pot or something?
Yeah! No!
Ready. What's the matter? It's all right. Burned my hand.
Oh, my God! Let me see. Let's go, Eve. Don't worry about it.
Let's go, Eve. Don't worry about it. -No, no, no, no, no! -Eve!
Aah!
I'm sorry. That was completely uncalled for.
Can we just…
Fine.
Parked out the back. Oh.
Oh, darn! -That thing. -What thing?
The waffle thing. I got to turn it off. Come on.
Hello.
Hello?
[Eve] All right. Very funny.
God, I hate that.
You trying to burn the building down?
Oh! Oh, sorry, honey.
Jeez! Nice one. Oh, there's my Tiger Balm.
Oh, there's my Tiger Balm.
I swear to God, Chev.
I don't know what you're on these days, but it is not working for you.
Ah, my hand cream. That's where you went.
Chev, can I have some help here?
Where's your car? My car. Actually, I took a cab.
This isn't going to be… This isn't going to be easy, as they say.
Oh, motherfucker.
All right. Here it is. Sorry.
You know I told you I was a video game programmer.
Yeah. Well, that was a lie.
Actually…
I kill people.
A professional hit man.
I freelance for a major West Coast crime syndicate.
Last night was a job like 100 others. A high dollar hit, nothing special.
The Triads from Hong Kong had been moving in on the local drug cartels for the last six months.
My target was their number one man in Los Angeles. Don Kim.
Well?
What are you waiting for?
Then, from out of nowhere, this insane idea comes in through the back of my head
like a .45 slug at close range.
Congratulations.
Did I win something? Your life, jackass.
One hundred grand wants you dead, so, sooner or later, it's gonna happen.
But I'm not doing it.
I see.
Instead, you're gonna do something for me.
You're gonna get out of town. Disappear.
I don't care where you go. I don't care what you do,
so long as you're invisible for 48 hours. That's all I ask.
Forty-eight hours?
Or, if you prefer… we can do it the other way.
The way where I go to work… and you meet Buddha.
See, I… I quit.
I quit the business. For you.
For me? Yeah.
I figure I call you that night, tell you everything. You understand.
We get on a plane together and leave all this shit behind. Never come back. Pretty crazy, huh?
Never come back. Pretty crazy, huh? You are so weird.
So, are we going on a trip? Well…
I might be going on a trip, but you're not coming with me.
Please, baby, please! Mob hits, Chev?
Chinese poison? Do you know how ridiculous you sound?
If you're going to break up with me, at least you can tell me the truth.
Chev? Chev?
What's the matter with you?
Wait a minute. Do you trust me? No.
Make love to me. What?
Come on, I think it'll help.
Help what? Are you kidding?
Get off me. -Take your clothes off. -No!
Aah!
You always say you want to be more spontaneous. You're insane.
You're like an adrenaline junkie with no soul.
Save me, Eve. Save my life. Stop it!
I'm sorry. Oh, my God, are you ok?
Are you ok?
Uh-uh. No. No! Enough.
Shit!
Get off! Aah! Aah!
You filthy animal.
Take me right here… In front of everyone.
That's it.
Come on! Do it!
What are you waiting for?
Jesus! Come on! I'm trying! Shush, Eve!
Oh, God, now you can't get it up? For God's sake.
Come on! Get it up! I'll fucking get it up! Jesus!
God damn it, Chev! Shut up!
I'm alive! I'm alive!
I'm alive, you motherfuckers!
Come on! Oh, my God! Wow!
Oh, my God! Oh!
Shit. Yeah. What are you doing?
Aah! Ah! [Kaylo] I've got Verona. Kaylo?
I've got Verona, man.
What? No shit. Where are you?
No shit. Where are you? Don Kim's shirt factory. I'm upstairs.
What's the matter with you? -Fifth and Alameda? -Yeah.
Who's at Fifth and Alameda? Listen to me.
You don't let that motherfucker out of your sight.
You hear me? With you in ten minutes.
You got it? -Yeah, Chev. -Out.
Listen, honey, I got to go.
I'll call you!
Oh, God, what are you looking at?
Hey, man, what's the matter with you? You a crackhead?
Right. Just step on it, all right?
You not going to die in my cab, crackhead.
I got something for you.
You take this Haitian shit, crackhead.
This shit right here is some hardcore shit. It's made from plant shit.
Hey, what are you laughing at? Look at this. You see that?
That's what a man look like, crackhead.
That's power.
Now look at you.
What the hell?
Yeah?
It tastes like ass.
Well, that's right, devil. You wait.
Shut the fuck up!
No! No! Get the fuck up there!
Whoop, there it is. Ah! Fuck him.
We're here.
What'd you say was in this stuff?
I told you it's hardcore.
It'd be $5.55.
It's all you, man.
Have a nice day, devil.
This is fucked.
Where's he going?
[man] Ok, ok.
How the fuck you going to call me, talking shit, homey, huh?
I'll smack the hell out of you. I don't know where he at. I ain't babysitting the motherfucker.
Fucking call me, talking shit. Shit.
I'm doing my job! I'm doing my shit!
I'm out here just chilling, doing what I do.
I'm out here just chilling, doing what I do. Hey, whoa, Chevy, Chevy, what's up, dog?
Hey, whoa, Chevy, Chevy, what's up, dog?
Everything all right? You chilling? You good?
What a fucking coincidence. What you talking about, man?
What are you doing? Waiting for a bus?
Nah, nah, actually, I thought maybe a helicopter'd come pick--
What the fuck is this?
What's what? What, are you working for the Chinese now? The Chinese? Come on, man, you crazy?
The Chinese? Come on, man, you crazy? You know I wouldn't do that to you, man.
I am crazy. Where's Kaylo?
-Ok, ding. -[timer dings]
Time's up. What you mean, ding? What you mean, ding?
What you mean--
Where is that motherfucker?
Chev.
What the fuck is this?
Chev, baby, take it easy.
Oh, you mean like this?
Now you tell me where that little toe-rag motherfucker is. Verona.
Verona's got nothing to do with this.
What?
Don Carlos wants you off the streets. Carlito.
You've totally lost your shit, dog.
You're all over TV. Destroying property, making unauthorized hits?
You're causing the organization a great deal of embarrassment.
You're telling me Carlito ordered this? Look, don't worry about Verona.
Look, don't worry about Verona. We'll take care of him.
The best thing for you to do is find some nice,
dark, quiet place, and…
just die.
"Just die." Do you think I've got "cunt" written on my forehead?
Maybe you're right.
We all got to die sometime, right? Yeah.
We all got to die sometime.
So just die.
What the f--
Oh, my fucking ass! You got shot!
Mother fuck!
-Aah! -Jesus. Eve, move.
You! Asshole! What you want? Don't talk to him like that!
My boyfriend kills people! Nice.
I had to see if you were telling the truth.
-[screams] -Ah! Come on.
No, wait!
Now come on.
Oh, God!
Oh, damn it!
I forgot to take my birth control pills. -What? -Yeah.
Where are the keys? -Chev. -Keys. -Eve, the keys. -Here.
Come on, come on! My stuff!
Aah! My stuff!
You weren't lying. Welcome to my life.
No, I mean… that you would give it all up for me.
Yeah.
And the other part? The poison? Yeah, that's true, too.
Then… that means…
Pretty much, Eve.
How can we stop it?
Adrenaline's the only thing that slows it down.
So, when we were in Chinatown?
Yeah. Sorry.
Eve, what are you doing?
This'll get you going. What?
Come on. Let's finish what you started. Oh, boy.
Oh, that's it. Oh, that's really working for me.
You like that? Stay down!
Motherfuck!
Jesus-- Yeah, that's it, baby. Just a little more.
Stay down, Eve.
Oh, Jesus. Oh, you're so big.
Oh, my God.
Just a… touch…
What's the matter? So you can fall asleep like you always do?
I don't think so.
Jesus, fuck!
Are they really…
They're dead.
How can you do that? I told you, baby. I quit.
I told you, baby. I quit.
Yeah? Chev. Holy shit, I've been trying to get a hold of you for half an hour.
Where the fuck have you been? At my office. Can you make it over here?
At my office. Can you make it over here? Sure. Why not?
Chocolate… What's this fucking receipt
from Gold Foods Market for $254?
Snacks.
[Chelios] I owe you again, Doc.
Chevy, you're my best customer.
What is this stuff? Synthetic ephedrine…
diluted with some saline. Feels sort of good.
Yeah, well, I got a little meth in there, too,
so that's the endorphins you feel running to your brain.
Wait a minute. So I'm not better?
Fuck, no, you're not better.
You're in such shit shape, it's stunning.
I can't believe your heart's still beating.
Shit should be in a fucking medical journal.
So what are you going to do? The solution I'm giving you is acting as a competing inhibitor,
meaning that it's pushing the poison right out of your receptors
and replacing it with a chemical. Now, that's just a temporary fix.
Then what?
Then what? You're fucked.
I could put you on life-support, Chev, and string this out for a few days.
But you're gonna go into a coma at some point.
Does she know?
Why don't you let me load you up with something?
You can go out in a beautiful dream.
A dream.
Can I do that for you?
No, no. That's not what I want.
What do you want?
One hour.
I want one hour.
Give me a fucking break.
[Reporter] And so, the wild rampage that began at 9:00 a.m. this morning in west Los Angeles continues
this morning in west Los Angeles continues with the mysterious suspect still at large.
Yo, maybe we should have given him more of that Chinese shit.
Oh, you think?
Oh, it's him.
What's up, corpse? Bonjour, douche bag.
I thought you might be interested in a little deal.
Oh, you want to-- Are you a dealer? Is that what you are now?
Don't you worry about what I am.
Listen, I want the antidote. Oh… Oh, the antidote.
That's right, the antidote.
What are you prepared to give me, asshole?
How about the jewelry I got off that faggot brother of yours, you fucking cocksucker?
Don't pop a blood vessel, you little penis. All right.
Oh, you like that deal, do you? Yeah, whatever.
I'll be at the Downtown Lint in 20 minutes.
You know the spot? Yeah, I know it.
Well, don't be late, or I'll trade this thing to some whore
for a fucking hand job. Look, I said I'll fuckin' be-- I'll fuckin' be there!
-[yelling over phone] -See you later, sunshine.
Goddamn it! Fuck.
Yo, it's Verona.
You're not going to believe this call I just got.
[Chelios] It's gonna be all right, baby.
[Eve] But you said… [Chelios] I know.
Things have changed.
There's an antidote.
I can make a deal for it, but I got to go alone.
[Eve] I'm scared. [Chelios] Of course.
But you'll be safe now. And I'll be back.
You promise?
I promise.
[woman's voice] Where did I go wrong? Did you fucking just say something?
[with woman's voice] It's like talking to the wall.
Mom? I'm amazed you remember you have a mother.
Mom, please. I haven't got time for this.
[Orlando's voice] You got no time, period.
Orlando?
You a persistent motherfucker, Chev Chelios.
I'll give you that.
They pop you and you just keep getting up?
I'm the Terminator.
[Verona's voice] You was that, maybe, but there's a new gun in town.
You know, I don't get it.
Why didn't you just cut me up alive when you had the chance?
Too easy, motherfucker. Look at you.
Bi-polar, sadomasochistic tendencies…
[Chelios's voice] Adrenaline junkie. Addicted to violence.
Carving up a guy like that
while he screams in his own blood and excrement. That'd be like-- Like a gift.
That'd be like-- Like a gift. A warrior's death.
Hell, you'd probably get off on it.
Who the hell are you, anyway?
I think I'm starting to figure it out.
Well, better late than never.
You know you're going to die up there.
You know you're going to die up there. Yeah. Maybe. But I'm taking you with me.
Some pills, Doc.
Chelios. Hello, girls.
Hold up.
Give me the piece.
Now isn't that a fucking picture? Chelios, what a fucking nightmare you are.
Chelios, what a fucking nightmare you are.
No shit.
Why don't you sit down?
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. You pat him down again.
I know he's carrying something.
Let me see that.
Motherfucker.
Is clever. What is this, an insulin pump?
Basically.
What the fuck is insulin?
Ephedrine, right?
Yeah. You're very resourceful.
Found a new master, little bitch, is that it?
I'm nobody's little bitch.
We'll see what kind of a bitch you are when Carlito hires you for half what he used to pay me and you take it.
That's enough.
You'll probably throw Boss a nice little reach-around
just to show him what a good little bitch you are.
You can't fucking say that! I'm nobody's little bitch!
You fucking hear me?
And he'll fuckin' pay me what I tell him to pay. I said that's enough! Now sit down!
I said that's enough! Now sit down!
It's been a long fucking day.
But, in the end, you have to admit, it all works out quite nicely.
Don Kim gets his bullet, thanks to you,
and Hong Kong gets a goat to take the fall.
Please understand, Chev. It's truly nothing personal.
You speak for yourself.
That what I think it is?
It's the Chinese shit.
Hold him down.
Not so fast, motherfucker.
He's gone dipsy-doodle, yo.
Yeah, whatever, psycho.
I'm afraid the Houdini act is over, my friend.
Our father, who art in Heaven--
Shut up, Verona! So this is how it is.
It's Don Kim! You're supposed to be dead! Presto.
Go, go, go, go, go! [Reporter] Police have moved to surround the downtown boutique Hotel Lint,
where the unidentified madman behind today's mayhem is believed to be holed up and making a desperate last stand.

Local officials have confirmed gunfire on the sun deck.
Our news chopper will be bringing live,
uncensored coverage from above the hotel momentarily.
Again, this coverage is live and uncensored,
so if you have any small children present, you may want to have them leave the room.
Get me out of here now!
I'll kill you for this, Chelios!
Too late!
Look out!
Thanks, Boss.
Let's get the fuck out of here, now! Let's go!
Present from Kaylo.
Now what? Now you say shit!
Where the fuck were you?
Who's the bitch now?
Oh no, you fly, motherfucker!
Motherfucking fly!
You're dead!
Oh, my God.
You're dead! Dead! You're dead, motherfucker!
Told you I'd kill you, you little bitch!
-[machine clicks] -Hey, this is Eve. I'm glad you called, but I'm not here.
Uh, can you leave a message? Unless you're trying to sell something, because I'm not interested.
But if you're not, then just…
Oh, wait! Time's up.
Hey, doll.
Looks like I let you down again.
Seems like, all my life I've just been… going… going…
going…
I wish I'd taken more time
to just stop and smell the roses, so to speak. ♪ Baby, like I believe ♪
-[prisoner gasps] -Hurry!
-[distant crowd shouting] -Come on!
Quick!
Come on, faster!
Open the doors. Come on, quickly!
[man 1] String him up, the burning scum!
[man 2] Let him suffer like my sister suffered!
Give him to the people!
Just read them the sentence.
The sentence of the court...
is that in two days hence, the perfumer, journeyman Jean-Baptiste Grenouille,
shall be bound to a wooden cross
with his face raised towards heaven!
And whilst still alive... be dealt 12 blows with an iron rod...
breaking the joints of his arms...
-[cheers] -...his shoulders...
-[cheers] -...his hips... -[cheers] -...his legs.
He shall then be raised up to hang until dead,
and all customary acts of mercy are expressly forbidden the executioner!
[narrator] In 18th-century France, there lived a man who was one of the most gifted
there lived a man who was one of the most gifted and notorious personages of his time.
His name was Jean-Baptiste Grenouille...
and if his name has been forgotten today,
it is for the sole reason that his entire ambition
was restricted to a domain that leaves no trace in history.
To the fleeting realm of scent.
In the period of which we speak,
there reigned in the cities a stench
barely conceivable to us modern men and women.
Naturally, the stench was foulest in Paris,
for Paris was the largest city in Europe.
And nowhere in Paris was that stench more profoundly repugnant than in the city's fish market.
more profoundly repugnant than in the city's fish market.
[fisherman] Here we are. I'll get another box.
[narrator] It was here, then, on the most putrid spot in the whole kingdom,
that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was born on the 17th of July, 1738.
It was his mother's fifth birth.
She'd delivered them all here under her fish stand
and all had been still-births, or semi-still-births.
You all right?
[narrator] And by evening, the whole mess had been shoveled away,
with the fish guts, into the river.
It would be much the same today.
But then Jean-Baptiste chose differently.
[woman] What's that noise?
-It's a baby. -[man] What's going on here?
[woman] It's a newborn.
Where's its mother?
She was just here.
She tried to kill it.
Her own child. She tried to kill her baby!
There! There she is!
[officer] Stop! Stop where you are!
Murderer!
[narrator] Thus, the first sound to escape Grenouille's lips
sent his mother to the gallows...
...and Jean-Baptiste, by official order...
...to the orphanage of Madame Gaillard.
[Gaillard] How many today?
[man] Four. Well, three and a half.
As usual, more dead than alive.
[man] Just take the money and sign.
[man] Make room.
-Where? -[man] Move!
Go on, now!
[boy] Is it dead?
[whispering] That's not staying in my bed.
Let's throw it out, then. What if it screams?
Let's just kill it.
[boy] Harder! Push!
-[Gaillard] What are you doing?! -[thunder rumbles]
[narrator] For Madame Gaillard,
Grenouille was a source of income just like any other.
The children, however, sensed at once
that there was something different about him.
By the age of five,
Jean-Baptiste still could not talk.
But he had been born with a talent
that made him unique among mankind.
It was not that the other children hated him.
They felt unnerved by him.
Increasingly he became aware that his phenomenal sense of smell
was a gift that had been given to him, and him alone.
When Jean-Baptiste did finally learn to speak,
he soon found that everyday language proved inadequate
for all the olfactory experiences accumulating within himself.
Wood.
Warm wood.
Grass.
Wet grass.
Stones.
Warm stones.
Water.
Cold water.
Frog.
Wet stones.
Big, wet frog stones.
Something...
something, something...
[narrator] By the age of 13,
Madame Gaillard no longer had room for Jean-Baptiste
and therefore decided to sell him.
Come on.
Ten francs.
[narrator] From his first breath of the odor enveloping this man...
Seven, and not one sou more.
...Grenouille knew that his life in Grimal's tannery
would be worth precisely as much as the work he could accomplish.
Come on. [Grimal grunts]
[narrator] Unfortunately for Madame Gaillard...
-[boy] Take it! -...the bargain was short-lived.
Life expectancy in the tannery was a mere five years...
but Jean-Baptiste proved to be as tough as a resilient bacterium.
He adjusted to his new fate
and became a paragon of docility and diligence,
slaved 15, 16 hours a day, summer and winter.
Gradually he became aware of a world beyond the tannery,
where a utopia of unexplored smells lay in store for him.
Grenouille!
Come with us. I'm taking you to town for delivery.
[narrator] Jean-Baptiste Grenouille had triumphed.
He was alive...
and at last he was in his element.
He was not choosy. He did not differentiate between
what are commonly considered to be good smells from bad...
At least not yet.
He was very greedy.
The goal was to possess everything the world had to offer in the way of odors.
[woman] Good morning, Monsieur.
[narrator] His only condition being that they were new ones.
Thousands upon thousands of odors formed an invisible gruel, which he dissected
formed an invisible gruel, which he dissected into its smallest and most remote parts and pieces.
[man] Buy your pennant here for tonight's fireworks at Notre Dame!
[Grimal] Grenouille!
Come on!
Get your ass over here.
[man] He needs two dozen skins by next week. Can you do that?
Yeah. Yeah.
[man] Come with me.
What is it called?
[perfumer] "Amor and Psyche," Madame.
My latest creation.
[young woman] May I try it?
[perfumer] If you'll allow me, Mademoiselle.
[young woman] Sheer heaven.
Monsieur Pelissier, you are truly an artiste.
[woman] Please, take them. I've got far too many.
What do you want?
Want to buy some?
Two for a sou.
[man] Stand clear!
Stand back there!
[man, laughing] I told you...
-[woman] Come on. -[man laughing]
[Grimal] Next time you run off like that, I'll kill ya!
[narrator] That night, he could not sleep.
The intoxicating power of the girl's scent suddenly made it clear to him why he'd clung to his own life
suddenly made it clear to him why he'd clung to his own life so tenaciously, so savagely.
The meaning and purpose of his miserable existence
had a higher destiny.
He would learn how to preserve scent so that never again would he lose such sublime beauty.
so that never again would he lose such sublime beauty.
There were about a dozen perfumers in Paris in those days.
One of them, the once-celebrated Italian perfumer, Giuseppe Baldini,
had set up shop in the center of the bridge called the Pont au Change on his arrival in Paris over 30 years ago.
called the Pont au Change on his arrival in Paris over 30 years ago.
To be sure, at one time in his youth
Baldini had created several truly great perfumes,
to which he owed his fortune.
But now Baldini was out of touch...
...out of fashion,
and spent his days waiting for customers that no longer came.
Chénier. There you are. -Monsieur Baldini. -Put on your wig.
-Monsieur Baldini. -Put on your wig.
Put on your wig.
You going out?
I wish to retire to my study for a few hours
and do not want to be disturbed under any circumstances.
Will you be creating a new perfume, Monsieur Baldini?
Correct. For Count Verhamont.
He has asked for something like, uh...
I think he said it was called, uh... Amor and Psyche...
from that swindler in the Rue Saint André des Arts.
-Pelissier? -Pelissier, that's him.
Ha! Amor and Psyche. [chuckles]
-Do you know it? -Oh, yes.
-Do you know it? -Oh, yes. You can smell it everywhere these days, Monsieur.
On every street corner.
In fact, I just purchased you a sample.
In case you wanted to test it.
What on earth makes you think I'd be interested in testing it?
You're right. It's nothing special.
Actually... [chuckles] it's a very common scent.
I believe the head chord contains lime oil.
Really?
-And the heart chord? -Orange blossom, I believe.
And civet in the base chord, but, you know, I cannot say for sure.
Well, I couldn't care less what that bungler Pelissier slops into his perfumes.
Naturally not, Monsieur.
And I am thinking of creating something for Count Verhamont
that will cause a veritable sensation.
that will cause a veritable sensation. I'm sure it will, Monsieur Baldini.
Take charge of the shop, Chénier, and don't let anyone come near me.
Inspiration requires peace and tranquility.
Teresa! [speaking in Italian]
Ah... sì.
Grazie, grazie, grazie.
Is there anything else you need? Inspiration, perhaps.
-Ah, my Giuseppe. -Ah...
You are still the great perfumer Baldini.
Bellissimo.
Wonderful.
He did it again.
Hmm. Lime oil. Yes, indeed.
Orange blossom, to be sure.
And a hint of cloves, perhaps.
No.
Or could be cinnamon?
It's gone. Mm.
Cinnamon.
It's not cinnamon.
Uh... cloves.
No. Musk?
No. Aah!
Who's there?
[Grenouille] I'm from Grimal's tannery.
I've brought the goat skins you ordered.
[Baldini] Follow me.
This way.
There. Lay them there.
Tell your master that the skins are fine.
I'll come by in the next few days and pay for them.
Yes, Monsieur.
You want to make this leather smell good, don't you?
Why, of course. And so it shall.
With Amor and Psyche by Pelissier?
Whatever gave you the absurd idea
I would use someone else's perfume?
It's all over you. It's on your forehead, your nose, your hands.
It's bad, Amor and Psyche is, master. There's too much rosemary in it and too much of...
There's too much rosemary in it and too much of... that and that...
Bergamot.
And patchouli?
Pa... Patchouli.
Patchouli, patchouli.
What else?
That and that.
That and that.
Orange blossom.
Lime.
-Musk. -Rosemary.
-And cloves. -And this.
[Baldini] Storax?
That's in it, too.
-Storax? -Storax.
[Baldini] Storax?
You have, it appears, a fine nose, young man, but--
My nose knows all the smells in the world.
It's the best nose in Paris, only I don't know the names. -I need to learn the names-- -No, no, no, basta!
-I need to learn the names-- -No, no, no, basta! You don't interrupt me when I'm speaking.
You are both impertinent and insolent!
Even I don't know every scent.
I've known for some time the ingredients of Amor and Psyche, but all it needs to find that out
of Amor and Psyche, but all it needs to find that out is a passably fine nose, nothing else.
But it needs the craft of a true perfumer
to detect the exact formula.
Which notes, which chords,
and in what precise measurements.
Could you tell me the exact formula of Amor and Psyche? Hmm?
Best nose in Paris.
Speak up.
You see, you can't, can you? And I'll tell you why.
Because talent means next to nothing...
while experience acquired in humility and hard work...
means everything.
I don't know what a formula is.
But I can make Amor and Psyche for you now.
Uh-huh. And you think I'd just let you slop around in my laboratory
with essential oils that are worth a fortune? -You? -Yes.
Now, pay attention.
What is your name, anyway?
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Very well, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.
You shall have the opportunity now, this very moment, to prove your assertion.
Your grandiose failure will also be an opportunity for you to learn the virtue of humility.
-How much do you want me to make? -How much of what?
How much Amor and Psyche do you want? [Baldini] Huh?
Shall I fill this flask?
No! You shall not.
You may fill this one. Yes, master.
-But, Master Baldini? -Mm-hmm.
You must let me do it in my own way.
As you please.
No. Don't drop that! That's pure alcohol.
You want to blow up the entire building?
You have to measure it first.
Stop! Stop it. That's enough. Basta! You know nothing.
Basta! You know nothing.
Essential oils are always to be mixed first,
then the alcohol added.
And never, ever is perfume to be shaken like that.
I must have been insane to listen to your asinine gibberish.
It's all done.
Mamma mia.
This is Amor and Psyche.
But it's not a good perfume, master.
If you let me again, master, I'll make it more better.
Now it's a really good perfume.
Don't you want to smell it, master?
[Baldini] I'm not in the mood to test it now.
I have other things on my mind. Go now.
-But, master-- -Go! Now.
Can I come to work for you, master? Can I?
Uh, let me think about it. Master!
I have to learn how to keep smell.
What?
Can you teach me that?
I shall have to think about it. Now, go.
I love you.
I'll give you 50 francs for him. [coughs]
-[man] Put your measly weight behind it... -[chuckling]
-[kid 1] Keep pulling! -[kid 2] Push! Push, man!
[Grimal] Grenouille!
[narrator] Grimal's transaction had a profound effect on all three parties.
[driver] Hey, watch out!
Not least upon Monsieur Grimal himself.
As for Giuseppe Baldini, the acquisition of Grenouille
miraculously transformed his dwindling business,
even surpassing its former glory.
While at last, for Jean-Baptiste,
the mysterious secrets of the perfumer's craft began to unfold.
[woman] He's a genius. It's magnificent!
[Baldini] Now, pay careful attention to what I tell you.
Just like a musical chord,
a perfume chord contains four essences, or notes, carefully selected for their harmonic affinity.
or notes, carefully selected for their harmonic affinity.
Each perfume contains three chords:
the head, the heart and the base,
necessitating 12 notes in all.
The head chord contains the first impression,
lasting a few minutes before giving way to the heart chord,
the theme of the perfume, lasting several hours.
Finally, the base chord,
the trail of the perfume, lasting several days.
[sighs] Ha! Mind you, the ancient Egyptians believed that one can only create a truly original perfume
that one can only create a truly original perfume by adding an extra note, one final essence
by adding an extra note, one final essence that will ring out and dominate the others.
Legend has it that an amphora was once found in a pharaoh's tomb
and when it was opened, a perfume was released.
After all those thousands of years,
a perfume of such subtle beauty and yet such power,
that for one single moment,
every person on earth believed they were in paradise.
Twelve essences could be identified,
but the 13th, the vital one...
could never be determined.
Why not?
Why not? What do you mean, why not?
Because it's a legend, numbskull.
What's a legend?
Never mind.
[Baldini] Jean-Baptiste. Jean-Baptiste?
What's the matter? Master, I have to learn how to capture scent.
Master, I have to learn how to capture scent.
What are you talking about?
I have to learn how to capture scent and reprise it forever.
You mean preserve. -You have to teach me that. -All right.
-You have to teach me that. -All right. Calm down, my boy. Hmm.
Calm down. We have work to do.
"The soul of beings is their scent."
You said that, master.
Did I?
I will make you as many perfumes as you want,
but you have to teach me how to capture the smell of all things.
Can you do that?
Well, naturally.
Then teach me everything you know.
And I'll make you the best perfume in the whole world.
[man] Mind yourselves.
Imagine, Jean-Baptiste. Ten thousand roses
Imagine, Jean-Baptiste. Ten thousand roses to produce one single ounce of essential oil.
[man] That's the last of them. [Baldini] Now, keep the air flowing
or the bottom petals will begin to stew... while I set up the alembic.
And take care not to damage them.
We have to let them go to their deaths with their scent intact.
Perfect. Now, help me with the Moor's head.
Temperature is vital.
When the quicksilver is here, the heat is precisely correct
and the oil will gradually rise.
Note that this mechanism
is a remarkable invention of my own devising.
You will observe how cold water
is pumped through here...
allowing the essence to condense here
until it finally...
appears... here.
Of course, out on the hillside above Grasse,
we had only to bellow pure, fresh air.
Ah, Grasse. What a town.
The Rome of scents.
The Promised Land of perfume.
No man can rightly call himself a perfumer
unless he has proved his worth in that hallowed place.
Not to worry. Happens all the time.
To Grasse.
Master. Look.
The very soul of the rose.
-[Baldini] Jean-Baptiste! -[feet descending stairs]
-What's wrong? -[Grenouille sobbing]
Jean-Baptiste.
What have you done?
-[Grenouille] You lied. -What?
You lied to me.
How dare you talk to me like that?
You said I could capture the scent of anything.
And so you can.
What do you smell? What do you smell?
Nothing.
What were you expecting to smell?
Glass.
But glass doesn't smell.
Course it does. What's this?
I don't smell a thing. -[shatters glass] -Basta!
-It should smell like copper. -Enough!
You were trying to distill the smell of copper?
Iron? Glass? Copper?
What else did you try?
No! Madonna mia! Have you gone completely insane?
You told me I had to experiment. Experiment? Experiment?
But not with the cat.
What kind of a human being are you? -[rod clangs] -Don't you know anything?
-[rod clangs] -Don't you know anything? You can no more distill the scent of a cat
than you can distill the scent of you or me.
I can't? Of course not.
-[doctor] He is in stadio ultimo. -[Baldini] What?
-[doctor] He's dying. -[Baldini] Is there nothing you can do?
-[doctor] I fear not. -[Baldini] No!
-He cannot die. -[doctor] Well, my fee is 50 francs.
[Teresa] 50 francs? You charlatan! You can't even name the disease.
[doctor] Indeed, I can, ma'am. Festering measles...
[Baldini, sighing] Oh, dear, Jean-Baptiste.
You cannot do this to me. Please, don't die on me.
Not now. Not yet.
Dio, Dio. Why?
Is there...
any other way...
to preserve smell besides distill it?
Jean-Baptiste?
Is there, master?
Well, yes, I believe there is.
What is it?
It is known as the mysterious art of enfleurage.
Can you teach me?
Not even I am intimate with its secrets.
But could I learn it in Grasse?
Ah, well...
Could I?
Where else but in Grasse?
[narrator] Within a week, Grenouille was well again,
but in order to travel to Grasse and find a job,
he needed a journeyman's papers.
Baldini agreed to provide them,
on condition that Grenouille left him not less
than 100 formulas for new perfumes.
Grenouille did not mind.
He could have given him a thousand. [Grenouille] One ounce of cedar...
[Grenouille] One ounce of cedar...
[narrator] The morning of Grenouille's departure, Baldini was pleased.
At last, he felt rewarded for his many years of hard work.
He could not remember a happier day.
Deeply satisfied, he went back to sleep
and awoke no more in this life.
[man] Look out!
[narrator] With every step Grenouille took away from the city, the happier he felt.
The air above him grew clearer, purer, cleaner,
and at last he was able to breathe freely.
There were two ways to reach Grasse.
The first followed the winding roads through the villages,
while the second led straight across the hills and mountains, down into Provence.
down into Provence.
The choice was quite easy.
Thus his nose led him ever higher,
ever further from mankind,
ever more towards the magnetic pole
of the greatest possible solitude.
Grenouille needed a moment
to believe that he had actually found a spot on Earth
where scent was almost absent.
Spread all around lay nothing
but the tranquil scent of dead stone.
There was something sacred about this place.
No longer distracted by anything external,
he was finally able to bask in his own existence...
and found it splendid.
After a while, he almost forgot his plans and obsessions.
And, indeed, might have done so altogether...
[woman] Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
[narrator] There were a thousand smells in his clothes.
The smell of sand, stone, moss.
Even the smell of the sausage he'd eaten weeks ago.
Only one smell was not there.
His own.
For the first time in his life, Grenouille realized that he had no smell of his own.
He realized that all his life he had been a nobody to everyone.
What he now felt was the fear of his own oblivion.
It was as though he did not exist.
By the first light of next morning, Grenouille had a new plan.
He must continue his journey to Grasse.
There he would teach the world not only that he existed,
that he was someone,
but that he was exceptional.
And with this decision,
it seemed that the gods had at last begun to smile on him.
Go on.
[man] Laura?
Laura?
Coming, Papa.
Haven't seen you here before.
It's my first season.
Picking together is always more fun.
They say you pick everything you find.
Idiot. How many times have I told you not to cram the blossoms in
like you're stuffing a chicken?
Watch how Grenouille does it.
Look how skillfully he handles them.
The whole art of enfleurage is to allow the flowers to die slowly.
In their sleep, as it were.
Handle them as you would a lady.
Wouldn't you agree with me, Druot?
If you say so, Madame.
You. Check the jonquil blossoms.
They need more time.
Do what I say.
Stop it. I'm not in the mood.
Hmm. Are you sure?
[Jeanne] Of course I'm sure.
I said...
no!
Suit yourself.
Lucien?
-Fetch me back the ladder! -[Lucien] Fetch it yourself.
Lucien?
Lucien!
Lucien?
Lucien?
Lucien?
Tuberoses for Madame Arnulfi. She here?
She's busy.
Seems such a waste to boil them.
Or whatever you do with them.
So, what do you do with them?
Warm them in animal fat.
[woman] What for?
The fat soaks up their scent. [woman] Then what?
Then I cool it to a pomade and...
and then I filter it before...
-[sniffs] -Before what?
Before I add in alcohol and other essences to make a perfume.
Don't touch anything.
What's in there?
-Nothing. Just flowers. -Can I look?
No. Not now. I've got work to do. -You must go now. -Come on. Let me look.
-You must go now. -Come on. Let me look.
-Don't touch. -Ah, my tuberoses.
Morning, Madame.
Morning.
Why have you covered the tank?
It's an experiment, Madame.
To, to... protect the blossoms from daylight.
To preserve the scent better. Mm-hmm.
Well, if you say so.
Come with me. I'll settle your master's account.
To preserve their scent better, you say?
I don't smell much.
No. Then my experiment was a failure.
[Druot] Make sure it's your time you're wasting, not ours.
[Grenouille] How much must I pay...
to be with you?
Depends what you want.
What's that stuff?
I'm creating a perfume.
Lie down, please.
Eww! It feels horrible.
It's only animal fat. To soak up your scent.
Creating a perfume, eh? Come on, admit it.
You're getting a bang out of this, aren't you? Aren't you?
I enjoy my work.
Hold your arm still.
Don't think you're gonna tie me up.
Hold out your arm, please.
I've come across some strange men in my time-- Just... relax.
Holy Mother, what's that?
[Grenouille] Just for scraping off the fat.
-Are you mad? -I said relax.
You'll ruin everything.
If you're frightened, you stink. Then your perfume will be spoiled.
I've had enough. Get out.
I've had enough. Get out. Here, take your money.
Basting me up in all this goo. What do you think I am? A Christmas goose? Get out of here!
Quickly, blow them out before the roses melt.
Roses can't melt, Papa. These ones can.
Now I'd like to propose a toast to our guest of honor,
His Excellency, the Marquis de Montesquieu.
May our trade continue to flourish.
-[man] Hear, hear! -[murmured approval]
[Marquis] I thank you all, and would ask of you the honor
[Marquis] I thank you all, and would ask of you the honor to be the first to offer my congratulations
to be the first to offer my congratulations to your beautiful daughter
and present her with a small token of my affection.
[man 1] It's beautiful.
-[man 2] Splendid. -[woman] It's beautiful.
I'm overwhelmed, Your Grace.
"Your Grace"?
I had hoped that we would be on more familiar terms by now.
Let's have a game of hide-and-seek. -Oh, yes! -[man] Oh, yes. But everyone must play.
[Marquis] Let the men catch the women.
-[applause] -Bravo! -Bravo. -[women giggling]
[woman] Come on!
Put me down. Please?
[Marquis] Now there's no escape.
Game's over, everybody.
Laura?
Time to go in now.
Laura?
[man] Albine? Françoise?
Laura, have you seen the twins?
No, not since the game started.
[woman] Albine? Françoise?
Albine? Françoise? Jacques?
-Take this way. -You two, with me.
Your Excellency? Through here.
-[man 1] Albine. -[man 2] Girls, where are you?!
-[man 3] Françoise! -[man 4] Albine!
[man 5] Françoise!
I told that cretin ten times to get these ready. [chuckles] Don't keep picking on the boy.
[chuckles] Don't keep picking on the boy.
I'll kill him, the useless little sewer rat.
Grenouille!
What are you doing? Why aren't the enfleurage frames...
Yes, Master? I mean, would you be good enough
I mean, would you be good enough to prepare the enfleurage frames, Jean-Baptiste?
Certainly, master.
[man] Hey, look.
See? There.
A curfew? Are you mad?
Jasmine can only be picked before dawn. We all know that.
This could mean the ruin of our trade.
Yours. And yours and yours.
Supposing it's your daughter next time?
Of course a curfew is necessary, but we also have to catch this man,
and the only way to do that is to understand how he thinks, what he wants.
[councilor] I should have thought that was obvious. Use your imagination.
And if I were to tell you that all except the prostitute
went to their graves with their chastity intact?
How would you know?
The coroner had each girl examined.
They were all found to be virgins.
Supposing there isn't a next time?
If we introduce a curfew, we may all go bankrupt for nothing.
So we wait until he's killed, what, six, seven, eight?
-[woman] It's Pauline! -[officer] Curfew!
-Go back to your homes. -Stay inside.
It's a curfew. Back inside.
-[mayor] Gentlemen. Gentlemen. -[murmuring]
We have to face the fact that our police are helpless in this matter.
I suggest that we ask for support from Paris.
-[man 1] Paris won't be smarter. -[man 2] We must arrest every Gypsy in Provence.
-[man 1] Paris won't be smarter. -[man 2] We must arrest every Gypsy in Provence. -And every beggar. -[man 3] And every man without a wife and family.
-And every beggar. -[man 3] And every man without a wife and family.
Listen.
We have to put ourselves inside the mind of this man.
Each of his victims had an especial beauty.
We know he doesn't want their virginity, so it seems to me that it's their beauty itself that he wants.
It's almost as if he's trying to gather something.
As if his ambitions are those of a collector.
A collector? Of what?
Their hair?
[woman] Get out! Get out of my store!
You murdering scum!
Whatever it is, I fear he won't stop killing
until his collection is complete.
[man] There you are. Next. Quick as you can.
Right. You, too.
-[servant] Monsieur. -[gasps]
[councilor] This man, this man is a demon.
A phantom who cannot be fought by human means.
Now, I insist that we call upon our bishop to excommunicate him.
-[crowd murmuring] -What good would that do?
Have you no faith in the power of our Holy Mother Church?
[Richis] This is not a matter of faith. There's a murderer out there
and we must catch him by using our God-given wits.
[councilor] I say until we submit to Mother Church,
these killings will not cease.
[bishop] Citizens of Grasse, we hereby declare that this murderer,
this demon in our midst,
has incurred the sentence of excommunication!
Not only has this depraved monster
robbed us of our daughters,
the young and fair blossom of this city,
and by his wanton acts
has brought our trade, our livelihood,
nay, our very existence,
to the brink of eternal darkness.
We therefore declare that this vile viper,
this ignominious carbuncle,
this execrable evil in our midst
shall henceforth be solemnly banned from our holy presence,
rejected from the communion of Holy Mother Church,
as a disciple of Satan, slayer of souls.
[rider] Stand clear! Stand clear!
[bishop] An infected limb, an outsider of the faith,
a necromancer, a diabolist,
a sorcerer
and a damned heretic.
Oh, God, in Thy most merciful spirit,
bring down thunderbolts upon his head
and may the Devil make soup of his bones.
-Amen! -My Lord!
My Lord! It's a miracle.
He's been caught. He's been caught.
My Lord, the fiend has been caught. In the city of Grenoble.
He's confessed to everything.
He's confessed to everything! -[murmuring] -[bishop] Oh...
Hallelujah.
-Hallelujah! -[all] Hallelujah!
[bishop] Praise be to God.
And we thank Him for listening to our prayers and answering them.
Amen!
[all] Amen!
[all] Amen! [woman] Amen!
[Richis] Just read the report. This cannot possibly be the same man.
He confessed to everything.
Including the murders in Grasse.
Yes. Under torture.
Look. Here.
He admits to strangling his victims,
pulling out their hair and ravaging them.
The girls of Grasse were killed by a single blow to the back of their heads,
their hair was carefully cropped, and not one of them was violated. Antoine, we're all happy it's over.
Antoine, we're all happy it's over.
Let it go.
-Papa, what's the matter? -We're going home. -Now. -But why? I'm enjoying myself.
-Now. -But why? I'm enjoying myself. -Don't argue with me, Laura. -Stop it. I'm going--
-Don't argue with me, Laura. -Stop it. I'm going--
Laura!
Laura!
Out of my way! Laura!
Laura!
Papa.
[Richis] I'm so sorry.
I know you must think me a very foolish man,
but try to understand.
You're all I have left. You don't need to explain, Papa.
If anything were to happen to you... I know.
But you must stop worrying about me all the time.
Sweet dreams, my love.
Sweet dreams, Papa.
Laura!
Papa, what's the matter?
Did you open the window?
No. Why?
[woman] Make sure all the furniture's covered...
Have this letter dispatched to the Marquis de Montesquieu immediately.
[woman] Marie? Quickly!
Steady.
Stay on the road north into the mountains.
Did Monsieur Richis leave? He did.
Which way?
North.
You sure it wasn't south? I saw them with my own eyes.
Why do you want to know?
I said north. North!
Grenouille?
Grenouille?
[worker] It doesn't feel flat. There we go.
[Druot] Grenouille?
Grenouille?
Good God.
[innkeeper] Good afternoon, Monsieur.
Good afternoon. Do you have anyone else staying here?
No, Monsieur.
Then I would like to take all your rooms for the night. [innkeeper] It will be our pleasure, Monsieur.
[innkeeper] It will be our pleasure, Monsieur.
And tomorrow, at first light, we wish to be ferried to the Ile de Lérin.
It's deserted, except for a few monks. I'm aware of that.
Very well, Monsieur.
[woman] Our finest room, Mademoiselle.
With a superb view of the sea.
One moment.
Very well.
Do you have a room next to this one?
Yes, but the view cannot be compared-- I have no interest in the view.
[woman, sobbing] Oh... God.
Monsieur.
Papa, will you please tell me now what's happening?
You haven't said a word all day. Why all this secrecy?
Last night I dreamt you were dead.
Murdered. Like all the other girls.
And the truth is, I'm convinced that the killer is still here somewhere.
All of his victims were young and beautiful
and who is there more beautiful than you, Laura?
Whatever his insane scheme,
it will surely be incomplete without you.
I've written to the Marquis, accepting his proposal of marriage on your behalf
and requesting that it take place as soon as possible.
Until then, you'll stay in the safety of the monastery.
And all this because you had a bad dream?
I've made my decision. But I don't know whether I even love him.
I'm afraid the circumstances leave us no choice. -Papa. -It's all arranged, Laura.
-Papa. -It's all arranged, Laura.
[guard] On your feet! Hands in the air!
Why did you kill my daughter?
Why?
I needed her.
Why did you kill my daughter?
I just...
needed her.
Very well.
But remember this.
I'll be looking at you...
when you're laid on the cross
and the 12 blows are crashing down on your limbs.
And when the crowd has finally tired of your screams and wandered home...
I will climb up through your blood...
and sit beside you.
I will look deep into your eyes...
and, drop by drop...
I will trickle my disgust into them...
like burning acid...
until...
finally...
you perish.
[woman] What do you think they'll do to him?
[man] Apparently they're gonna break every bone in his body with an iron bar.
-[woman 2] Filthy piece of bile. -[crowd arguing]
-[woman 2] Filthy piece of bile. -[crowd arguing] [woman 3] Mind your own business!
[woman 3] Mind your own business! -[crowd shouting] -Fathead. [spits]
Look, there he comes.
[man 1] To hell with him! Where he belongs!
[man 2] Hit him hard with that!
Unchain the prisoner.
That's enough.
Let him be brought to the scaffold.
What's that?
Gloria Patri et Filio et Spiritu Sancti.
Amen.
[woman] Is he coming? What is it?
This man is innocent.
-He didn't do it. It's impossible. -He's innocent!
-[woman] Look at him! -[man] He's innocent!
An angel.
This is no man, this is an angel!
I love you!
[Richis] Grenouille!
You can't fool me!
Forgive me...
my son.
[narrator] The people of Grasse awoke to a terrible hangover.
For many of them, the experience was so ghastly,
so completely inexplicable and incompatible with their morals,
that they literally erased it from their memories.
The town council was in session by the afternoon
and an order was passed to the police lieutenant
to immediately begin fresh investigations into the murders. I'm innocent! This is madness.
[narrator] The following day, Dominique Druot was arrested
since it was in his backyard that the clothes and hair of all the victims had been found.
After 14 hours of torture, Druot confessed to everything.
With that, the case was closed.
By then, Grenouille was already halfway back to Paris.
He still had enough perfume left
to enslave the whole world if he so chose.
He could walk to Versailles and have the King kiss his feet.
He could write the Pope a perfumed letter and reveal himself as the new Messiah.
He could do all this and more if he wanted to.
He possessed a power stronger than the power of money, or terror, or death.
The invincible power to command the love of mankind.
There was only one thing the perfume could not do.
It could not turn him into a person who could love and be loved like everyone else.
So, to hell with it, he thought.
To hell with the world.
With the perfume.
With himself.
On the 25th of June, 1766, around eleven o'clock at night,
Grenouille entered the city through the Porte d'Orléans
and, like a sleepwalker,
his olfactory memories drew him back to the place where he was born.
An angel!
I love you.
[narrator] Within no time, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille had disappeared from the face of the Earth.
When they had finished, they felt a virginal glow of happiness.
For the first time in their lives
they believed that they had done something
purely out of love.
Over here! Look.
-A jacket. -Yeah!
-Hey, Maya. -Hey, Monty.
Hey, baby.
-What up, Willie? -What's up, young blood?
-How are you? -Old and tired. [chuckles]
That woman say this engine won't start. Yeah, well, it won't.
You know, Monty, he was supposed to fix it.
Never did.
He don't know what he doing. That fool can't even see.
I saw your momma the night you were made.
What'd you say to me? Don't you make me put this baby down.
That ain't no way to talk to me.
I gave this car service one of its best clients.
Yeah, you never let me forget it neither.
That's right. Maya, I'll take a look at it for you, baby.
-Take a seat. -Thank you.
You all right? And you better do something, you know Chico quit.
You don't want to lose my boss as a client. Ma'am.
Here you go, Willie. [Willie] How much is here?
[Monty] Not enough, but I'll get it to you. I promise. Okay?
Hey, hey, man, look. I just lost one of my drivers.
He was the only one classy enough to drive the old corporate types.
-Now, listen to me-- -No, no, no, Willie.
-Now, listen to me-- -No, no, no, Willie. You know I can't stand them. Hear me out. The pay is good.
Hear me out. The pay is good.
-The stuck-up types. -Oh, come on, now.
It would help you make more of a down payment for this place.
Man, Willie. You know I'm better under the hood
than I am behind the wheel, man.
Do you really want to buy this place? Now this is a start. The pay is good.
Now this is a start. The pay is good. I got you a good client, and she pays well. I don't want to lose her.
I got you a good client, and she pays well. I don't want to lose her.
-I'll think about it. -You'll think--what?
I'll think--what? Watch it, old man.
I'll think--what? Watch it, old man. You watch it.
Maya, turn the key?
-[Maya] Thank you, Monty. -All right, baby.
You know, this should really be your place.
Oh, it will be soon, baby. A'ight.
-Hey, boy. How you been? -What up, Kevin.
-All right? -Yeah.
Oh, man. Oh, man.
Wilbert! Get up!
-Hey, Monty. -Hey, Ms. Rochelle.
You got people stepping all over you!
-He at it again? -Get up!
Always. Always.
[woman] Hi, Monty!
Wilbert! Get up, boy!
[Monty] Is anybody home?
[coughs] Sierra? [coughing] Get the door.
Who is it? [Monty] Who is it? It's your daddy. Open up.
Hey, y'all, it's daddy! [both] Daddy!
[Monty] Come on, y'all. Hurry up.
Hey. What up, come here, come here, come here.
What's going on? Can I come in?
Hey, Ms. Kat.
Hey, Daddy, what'd you bring us? Oh, now, is that all I'm good for?
No. -Can I get some love? -[laughter]
Daddy, you know I got a "B" on my class project?
[Monty] Oh. -Thanks for helping me. -What'd I tell you?
Girl's gonna get a good grade. And I did.
Hey, daddy? Will you take us to the movies this weekend?
-No. -[coughs]
Okay.
I'll take you out to the movies.
You know, Saturday is daddy-daughter day so.
Okay. So, Daddy, what did you bring us? Just some food, baby. Oh!
-Dad... -That always comes in handy.
You girls go in the room, let me talk to your daddy.
You girls go in the room, let me talk to your daddy. Get in there. Don't make me come in there.
What y'all doing, playing checkers? Huh?
You're always playing something.
Here, Ms. Kat, I got 200 this week.
I'll owe the rest to you.
You know, Ms. Kat, you know you gotta take care of that cough.
I mean, it sounds like it's getting worse every time I come up in here. [sniffs] Yeah.
[sniffs] Yeah.
Jenny been by? That daughter of mine?
No. Only time I see her is when she's driving by.
She ain't been here to see these girls in months.
So happy you're here, or they wouldn't know they had a daddy or a momma.
Monty? You sit back. Sit down.
You sit back. Sit down.
What's wrong?
I need you to go down to family court with me right away,
so you can tell them that you're taking the girls.
I need you to raise them.
Ms. Kat, you know I love my kids, but I can't take them full-time--
Then they gonna have to stay with their mom.
-Now, you know I don't want that. -Neither do I.
Especially since she's living with that Joe, the biggest drug dealer in the area.
Sitting up there in that window, staring down at all of us like he's God.
And she's right there with him.
She don't care about nobody but herself.
Do you know what'll happen to them girls if they have to live with their momma? Huh?
God forbid.
-Monty, please. -Ms. Kat, I--I--
I have lung cancer.
I am dying, Monty.
I've been hanging in here for them girls as long as I can, but I'm dying.
I'm dying.
Why didn't you say something? Why didn't you tell me this?
Ms. Kat, it's gonna be all right.
It is not gonna be all right.
Why didn't y'all call me?
Mommy! -Don't look at her. -[Jenny] No, wait.
Wait, where do you think you're going?
These are my kids. Stop. Stop. Get out of here!
Get in the car, baby. Stop. Quit it! No, you get off of me!
Stop it, Jenny! Stop it. For real.
Everything all right, baby? No, you get my kids out of this car!
Jenny, stop, stop!
You have not been to see these kids in months.
You want to come take them now? Huh?
Get off of me! You gotta be crazy. Get out of here.
Nah, you need to back up, son. Yo, do me a favor, shut up.
Stop it! Stop it, stop it!
Go ahead, baby. Go ahead.
This is your mother's funeral, and you know she wanted these girls to go with him.
Jennifer, you know it.
You out whoring around with these thugs.
She didn't want these girls around all of this foolishness.
Let me tell you something, Aunt Rita.
All right, these are my kids! Do you hear me?
You ain't just gonna take 'em from me!
And let me tell you, go make your mechanic money.
You save it, 'cause we're going to court, you hear me?
Give me my kids back. You're gonna give them back to me.
You stay outta my way!
What are you doing? Think you gonna let my momma die?
Huh? You gonna let them bury my momma, and you don't tell me, Willie?
[man] You should've been there for your momma.
[Jenny] You know it ain't right. [woman] Too late now.
[Sierra] Daddy, you know this place is too small for all of us.
[Lauryn] Well, we don't have anywhere else to go. [China] we can go live with momma.
China, momma don't want us. She never did.
-That's not true. -It is true.
-Is that true, daddy? -I'll tell you what is true.
I want y'all to come stay with me. Hmm?
Where we gonna sleep?
Well, I'm gonna sleep on the couch, and you guys, I mean girls,
and you guys, I mean girls, are going to sleep in the bedroom.
I fixed it up.
How bad was it before?
Daddy? China pees in the bed.
And I ain't sleeping with her.
I do not! Why you gotta put all my business out like that? What's wrong with you?
I do not! Why you gotta put all my business out like that? What's wrong with you? Whatever. We need some separate beds
Whatever. We need some separate beds or some bunk beds or something, 'cause this ain't gonna work.
or some bunk beds or something, 'cause this ain't gonna work. Well, I'll work on it, okay?
Well, while you work on it, how about feeding us
and getting all three of us some food? 'Cause all three of us are hungry.
You know what? You got a mouth like your momma.
You need to put your clothes in them drawers right here, thank you.
I like this bedroom.
Lord, how am I going to do this?
Man, I can't believe I'm doing this.
You waiting for Ms. Rossmore?
Uh, yeah. Rossmore. Julia rossmore.
Good luck.
-[chuckling] -What you mean, "Good luck"?
-Good day, Ms. Rossmore. -Good morning.
You gonna open the door? Uh, yeah, yeah.
-Can you close the door? -Oh, yeah. Oh.
-[laughs] -What you laughing at?
[Julia] Tell him to meet me there. Tell him to wait, then.
I'm surprised the jury's returned so soon myself.
That's a great thing. Yeah, definitely. All right, see you in a second.
Did they tell you I need you to be on call?
Oh, you talking to me? You're the only other person in the car.
Oh, no, you know what, I thought you were still on the phone, you know.
Well, basically all I need you to do is get me to the office and get me to court. Mm-hmm.
Sometimes I work late, and sometimes I entertain clients after work,
Sometimes I work late, and sometimes I entertain clients after work, that sort of thing.
You know what, Ms. Rossmore? Right now, I need all the overtime I can get.
I'm sorry, what's your name?
-Oh, Monty. -Monty. Look, I don't like to fraternize, so let's keep this strictly professional, okay?
-Yes, ma'am. -Fabulous.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry about that. Hah.
Are you-- am I getting punk'd?
No, you're not getting punk'd, ma'am.
I just, you know, thought you might want the radio--
-No, I like silence. -Yes, ma'am.
[Julia] Silence. You've missed your turn.
[Julia] Silence. You've missed your turn. I asked you to take the freeway.
Oh, you know what? This way is much faster.
-Excuse me? -Yeah, you seem like you're a rush.
-Excuse me? -Yeah, you seem like you're a rush. And this way is faster, so...
Yeah, I am in a rush and I know this city.
The freeway would've bypassed all of this lunchtime traffic.
I cannot believe this. Why are you stopping?
I cannot believe this. Why are you stopping? 'Cause we're here now.
-Next time, follow my instructions, okay? -Oh, yes, ma'am.
Ms. Rossmore?
[judge] The jury has a question that they need answered.
They want to know if the damage award can be higher
than what was previously requested. Well, your honor...
So how's the driving going?
Oh, look, she is something else.
I know, I've worked for her four years.
She's good, though, she wins every case. And this is a big one.
[judge] One word for you, counselor-settlement.
That means she just won a grip of money.
-She's that good. -Mm-hmm.
My client's willing to talk.
Oh, and she's also impatient so you might want to get out to the car.
Sorry, my bad.
Your honor, the people have no evidence.
-We have evidence. -That is not admissible.
The search warrant gave them the right to search the house, not the car.
-He's right. -Your honor--
The evidence of the drugs is inadmissible.
[criminal lawyer] In that case, your honor, we immediately ask that all the charges be dropped,
and that the case be dismissed without prejudice--
[D.A.] Your honor, we need to get him out of the neighborhood.
Then your officers should've been more careful.
Where is your eyewitness? He has intimidated the entire community.
Then your office has its work cut out for them.
I'm dismissing all the charges.
Adjourned.
They can't hold me, baby. Mm.
-You're the man. -Thank you.
You want some pizza? All right, I'm gonna bring some for you, all right? I'll be there soon.
All right, I'm gonna bring some for you, all right? I'll be there soon. -[Jenny laughs] Yes. -I love you.
-[Jenny laughs] Yes. -I love you.
-Well, do you see this? -Yeah, I see it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. -Whoa, whoa. -I see.
You looking like a little massa' boy.
Wow, so you had to get yourself another job, huh?
Yeah, I know, feedin' them girls ain't easy, huh?
Here, oh, let me help you out. Let me see what I got in here.
Oh, look at that. Here.
-Take it. -Stop it. Take it. Oh, so what you Mr. Do the right thing?
Take it. Oh, so what you Mr. Do the right thing?
Oh, so you don't want this money. It's okay, I'll take it back.
-You gonna leave me alone? -What you gonna do, baby?
You see that brother right there?
If I even break a nail, he will shut you down.
-[scoffs] -And I'm coming for my daughters.
You don't even want your kids. Huh? Now why would you do all this--
You tried to turn my momma against me. Huh? You tried to turn my kids against me, it ain't gonna happen, baby.
Huh? You tried to turn my kids against me, it ain't gonna happen, baby.
Yeah, I'm gonna make your life hell, little punk.
Look at him, Joe. I think he gettin' mad.
He ain't gonna do nothing. He's so scared to go back to jail.
Yeah, go on lookin' like a slave.
Go on, suh. Mosey on down.
Go on and drive the car.
[Joe] Let step-and-fetch-it get back to work, now.
Hey, man, nice suit. [Jenny] Step-and-fetch-it. Look at you.
[Jenny] Step-and-fetch-it. Look at you. Lookin' just like a broke down slave.
I must've been a fool having three babies by you.
Ugh, please, yuck! I'm just disgusted with myself.
-Oh, do you think that's him? -I think that's him.
-Hi. -Excuse me.
Is this Ms. Rossmore's car?
Uh, who's asking? -Yup, this is it. -This is it.
-Excuse us. -It's okay.
-No, we got it. -Got it.
We know her. Thank you.
-Okay. Okay -Thank you.
Oh, goodness.
Uh, Ms. Rossmore, you, uh, you have somebody-- -You gonna open my door? -Uh, you have--
-You gonna open my door? -Uh, you have-- -Are you going to open my door? -Mm-hmm.
[Julia] Oh, what are you doing in my car?
It's that time.
-No, no. -Yes.
I just want to celebrate winning this case, okay?
Third and Peachtree, please. I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to pass on the blind date.
I knew she was gonna say that. Didn't I tell you now?
-You're going out. -I can't.
Do you know what your associates are saying about you at the office?
I don't care.
They're saying that you need a man.
Okay, and that you're taking it out on everyone at the office.
And they also say that you would be a nicer person if you just got laid.
-I agree. -[coughs]
I don't need to get laid, as you so eloquently put it.
Yes, you do.
Look, we have been your friends since college. We know what you need.
Well, if you know me so well, you'd know that I don't like blind dates. Ah.
-They all end in disaster. -Julia.
First of all, I have a very, very good feeling about this one, I do.
All right, so, Julia, I heard you was like a lawyer and stuff.
I am. Yeah, so you got this then?
-The--the bill? -Yes.
No, I'm serious though. This' a nice place, I like this...environment.
This' a nice place, I like this...environment. You know, it's gangsta.
Feel like, you know, you could do some things in here.
You know what else is nice?
You got some sexy-ass lips. Mm!
Just wanna bite 'em, argh.
Suck on 'em, suck your lips off your face.
Yeah.
I am gonna kill Cynthia and Brenda. Holla.
You don't want to mess with your boy right here. I mean, if you like pleasure.
Hey, hey!
Hey!
Hey! Hey, come here, man.
Yes, sir.
What kind of fish is this fill-et mig-non?
I'm sorry? Y'all got Chinese food?
[waiter] Uh, I'm sorry, we don't, sir. But how can I help you?
You know what? Just give me some scrimps, man, and some, uh, some hot sauce,
You know what? Just give me some scrimps, man, and some, uh, some hot sauce, and some fries with it.
And for the lady?
You know what? This water is gonna be just fine.
So we can just, speed the whole thing along.
-I understand. -I bet you do.
-And your scrimps will come out right away, sir. -[Julia] Thank you.
Can we get some bread, man? We the only table without bread.
All the white people got bread.
[waiter] I apologize, sir. -I'll get that to you right away. -Thank you.
That's a lot of hot sauce.
Wow. What do you do for a living?
Well, right now I'm between jobs, so I decided I'm gonna be a rapper.
A rapper? -Yeah. -That's somethin'.
-Yeah. -That's somethin'. Straight up. Check it out. ♪ Uh, uh, uh, uh ♪
-You feel me? -Um.
Man, I be feelin' that. It's like I just--
I'm sorry, how old are you? Forty, shorty.
-Forty? -Yeah.
You don't think that's too old to start a rap career?
Why everybody keep saying that?
I mean, yeah, but, you know, I'm good, and I got a gimmick.
You got to have a gimmick in this game.
You heard of 50 Cent?
-Yes. -They call me 40 Percent.
Check please! Check. They call me 40-p!
[Julia] Oh, it's official. No, this is my proclamation, Cynthia.
I'm giving up on men.
-Why? -'Cause I'm 31, I've never been married, I don't have any kids,
I don't even have a cat to curl up with,
and because I make six-figures, I can't find a decent man to save my life.
-What was wrong with this guy? -Are you kidding me?
The man had no class, Cyn. No, he had no class.
He was screaming across the restaurant for some scrimps.
-[stifled laugh] -Yeah, scrimps. I don't even know how to spell scrimps.
Am I being unreasonable?
All I want is a man who knows when to hold me,
and rub my feet and make me feel safe. Is that too much to ask?
Not, sweetie, it's all possible if you just relax your standards a little bit.
Girl, whatever. What's up with black men all trying to be down?
All of a sudden, everybody's gotta be down.
Like speaking correct English is somehow uncool.
Like, verb-noun agreement is just too much.
And if I see another black man over 30 in a throwback jersey, girl, I'm gonna scream.
in a throwback jersey, girl, I'm gonna scream.
What was that? I just saw one.
Julia, I just think you're too hard on some of these guys, okay?
You just need to relax a little bit. Excuse me. I have standards.
Excuse me. I have standards.
Yeah, well, the Pope can't meet your standards. Okay?
And I don't mean to be rude, sweetie, but, I got a man waiting for me, and I gots to go.
I got a man waiting for me, and I gots to go.
No, go. No, go, it's cool.
Don't, don't hate. I'm not hatin', Cyn.
[Cynthia] All right, you sound just like-- No, my battery's dying anyway.
Wait, I can't-- I--can't-- -[voice breaking up] -Hello?
You gotta be kidding me. I am so sorry--
-You gotta be kidding me. -I'm sorry.
You're gonna answer it. You know what, I gotta get this one.
Uh, this is my neighbor and she got my kids. Excuse me.
Unbelievable.
Hold up. Okay. You're on company time. You're not supposed to be taking personal calls.
You're on company time. You're not supposed to be taking personal calls.
Well, what happened? Yeah, I know where it is. I'm on my way.
[Julia] Whoa. Whoa. Where are you taking me?
-Lady-- -I'm being kidnapped.
I'm being kidnapped! Somebody help!
-Stop. -You stop, 'cause you're in big trouble, pal. Look, lady, look, I'm sorry--
No, no, no, you're gonna be sorry.
You know, you have a big problem 'cause you're fired! Fired!
I have a problem right now and I'm so tired
I have a problem right now and I'm so tired of your stuck-up ass giving me a hard time.
Now, do me a favor. Sit back, shut up, and ride, okay?
Thank you.
I do not believe this.
No way. No way. No. No, he didn't do this.
Excuse me? I'm Monty James, you have my kids here?
Have a seat. Someone will be with you in a minute.
Are they here?
Excuse me, are they all right?
-Have a seat, sir. -Where are they?
Excuse me, excuse me. Where are they?
Have a seat, sir.
Did he take--he took the keys. He took the keys.
-[honking] -Fabulous.
I'm just gonna call, who can I call? Oh, my battery's dead. Great.
No. No. Julia, no. You're in control, here, and...
here, and... You're just gonna walk in there and demand he take you home.
Take me home, wodie. No, that--do they say that? No.
Take me home, Brother.
Yes.
Hey. Look, I try to support black-owned businesses,
but this is absolutely ridiculous. Take me home now.
Monty, Ms. Rossmore--
Monty, Ms. Rossmore-- Maya, what are you doing here?
I live next door to your-- Monty. Your driver.
Well, he's not my driver after tonight, thank you very much.
Next time you want to recommend a little car service to me, Maya,
make sure it's not one of your buddies from the hood, okay?
Maya, what happened? Well, there was a fire, and then--
Uh, Jennifer Jackson, Monty James? [Monty] Yeah, right here.
Laurie Bell, department of social services. Are my kids all right? Where they at?
They're fine, they're being looked after. Mr. James, this could've been really bad.
I know, I know. I had to work tonight, and, um, the oldest one,
and, um, the oldest one, she's old enough to look after the little ones--
And I live right next door.
This is my neighbor here-- Well, your daughter started a fire.
Now, I'm sure it was an accident. The fire wasn't that bad, but if your neighbor had not broken down the door,
The fire wasn't that bad, but if your neighbor had not broken down the door,
your daughters could've died of smoke inhalation.
Now we're gonna have to look after your daughters for a little while.
Oh, no, no, this is a mistake--
It's a mistake that could've gotten them killed, Mr. James.
Now, you can call about visitation,
but for now, they're in custody of their mother.
No, ma'am, no, no. No. Uh, let me talk to the little one, please?
No. Uh, let me talk to the little one, please?
-Look, all right-- -Mr. James-- Mr. James, I'm sorry.
-Go get my kids. Just go get my kids-- -Come on, Mrs. Jackson.
Hold on, hold on--
And my mother had the nerve to think that you would do a better job than me.
So I guess this right here is a better job?
Almost killing my kids?
-Just go get little China-- -No, go get nothin'.
You know we gonna get custody now, right?
And we'll enjoy raising your little girl-- No, you won't!
-You want to start with me? -Give me a reason.
-You want to start something, Monty? -Monty!
You picked the wrong person to mess with. -[man] Yeah, yeah. -Back up. This is not the place.
All right. Let me get my kids, man, just let me get my kids, man.
-Got you, player. -What you say--
-Got you, player. -What you say-- Monty.
Is he gonna take me home?
How old are your girls?
Five, seven, and twelve.
Look, I'm sorry about before. Are they gonna be okay?
If you don't mind, I don't want to talk about it.
I'm sorry.
[Willie] Yeah. Uh, he's walking in right now.
I promise you I'll take care of it myself.
Please, please forgive me. Thank you for your business.
What? I told you I couldn't do it.
I told you, man, I'm glad she called and fired me.
You feel sorry for them girls.
You get that court date yet? Custody hearing's in seven days.
I called like, like nine lawyers this morning,
they all said the same thing. They need more money and more time.
Don't look at me.
I just feel like, you know, I make two steps forward, I gotta make four steps back.
All Ms. Kat asked me to do was raise them kids.
And, I can't even do that.
You know Jennifer and that crack dealer,
they got long money.
You gonna need some help from God and two more white people to fight them.
So my assignment today is to encourage your faith by using what Paul said.
He says, "And let us not grow weary in well-doing."
He said, "For in due season, you shall reap if you faint not."
Now, what I'm trying to tell you... ...is that God is faithful.
And in His faithfulness, he reminds us that in doing good, you shall get weary.
he reminds us that in doing good, you shall get weary.
There's no sin in getting weary, the sin is giving up,
because I'm here to announce to you,
you're so close to your due season, you're about to taste it, there's about to be a manifestation of God--
you're about to taste it, there's about to be a manifestation of God-- ...in your life, and it's not time to throw in the towel.
...in your life, and it's not time to throw in the towel.
It's time to lift up your head, because something's about to happen in your life,
and God's gonna ensure it.
The evidence that you're so close to your breakthrough,
the evidence that you're so close to your payday and your reward for walking righteous
and your reward for walking righteous is that you will feel like, you better hear this
is that you will feel like, you better hear this -I'm telling you something... -[cheering]
...you will feel like you're about to faint.
And when you feel like you're about to faint, don't faint.
Because that says that I'm right there next to my miracle.
I'm right there, right at the door of my due season.
I'm talking to those that walked into this church today
with their head kind of hung down,
and just about to give up and about to lose your faith.
I'm encouraging you, keep the faith!
Stay right there. Don't faint. Hold on.
God is about to bring your due season!
And you need to give Him praise, you need to bless His name,
you need to tell him, I'm still holding on.
God bless you, God bless you, and god bless you.
You know how you working my man's nerve with that whining?
You think I'm gonna let you come in between me and my man with all that mess? You gonna stop that.
me and my man with all that mess? You gonna stop that.
I want my daddy. Well, you ain't goin' back to your daddy.
-Why? -Because I said so, that's why.
You gonna stay right here with me.
And you're goin'. China, you gonna stop that whining.
And you're goin'. China, you gonna stop that whining. China, get in there, get in there.
You gonna stay here with me, you ain't going back to your daddy.
Now you get in there until you figure that out. -[China screams] -Get in there.
Lauryn, go in there with her. Go talk to your sister.
I gotta tell you something, now, y'all better be glad I know Jesus.
[sighs] Y'all get on my nerves.
...really good. I'm over here.
Mm-hmm, selling drugs right out here in front of this holy place.
[Maya] Oh, my goodness. You know what? They need to be stopped.
Janis' son got caught selling in school, and said he got it from him.
He comes to school and recruits the kids, babies, Monty. Mm-hmm.
And then he sends them to go sell.
You know, Monty, you really need to come to this community meeting.
Monty, a lot of people respect you in this neighborhood,
and they still remember. Hmm.
-You should come to one of the meetings. -I know.
I'm praying for you, and for you to get your girls back.
-I'll baby-sit anytime, okay? -Oh, I'll baby-sit, too.
Honey, the devil never wins, unless you don't fight.
Yeah. You're right. All right, well, I'll see you all later.
Yeah. You're right. All right, well, I'll see you all later. Okay, baby.
Oh, I'm going back in for a piece of cake.
Now, you know, baby, you're old enough to understand some things, okay.
All right?
Now, you ain't gonna just be sitting around here living off of me.
You got that?
Hey, look at me while I'm talking to you.
Look at me while I'm talking to you, I said.
Don't you dare not look at me.
It's time for you to start your own hustle. -No, no, no. No. -What do you mean, "no"?
-No, no, no. No. -What do you mean, "no"?
-Are you telling me-- -I'm not a hustler.
No, you--you-- You gonna be whatever I tell you gonna be.
I'm trying to teach you how never to be broke another day in your life.
The number one rule to the game
is never get caught.
You got that?
Now, I'm about to go get a drink.
You want one?
Willie's garage. Can I help you?
Hold on. Monty, telephone. Yo.
Yeah?
What?
We called her mother, but no one answered.
This kind of thing is frowned upon, Mr. James.
Yes, sir.
C.C., where'd you get this from? Huh?
Go ahead and answer me. Joe.
-Joe gave you this? -Who is Joe?
-Joe gave you this? -Who is Joe? Joe is, uh, her mother's boyfriend.
What is wrong with you, C.C.?
-Huh? Did you lose your mind? -I don't want you to die.
What are you talking about?
He said if I didn't do it, he was gonna get one of his boys to take you out.
And Joe's crazy, Daddy. He'll do it. -I know he will. -It's okay.
-I know he will. -It's okay. ...that's my daughter in there.
Hey, didn't I tell you not to call him? These are my kids. He has no right to my kids.
These are my kids. He has no right to my kids.
Did you give this to my daughter to sell?
-Is this punk talking to me? -No, I don't think so.
-I'll take that as a yes. -Look, man--
Daddy!
I got you now. Look at him. Look at him.
-Security, get up here now. -You want to play?
-Daddy! -Right away. The principal's office.
Let him go! [Joe] I run this, man. Ain't nothing you can do about it.
[Joe] I run this, man. Ain't nothing you can do about it. -These are my streets! -It's okay, baby.
-These are my streets! -It's okay, baby.
Do yourself a favor, Monty, live.
'Cause if you keep coming at me the way you coming at me,
we won't need a custody hearing, you heard me?
-[Jennifer] Stop it, Sierra. -Let me go!
Oh, daddy's all right. -Daddy's all right. -Daddy, please, can we go?
-Daddy's all right. -Daddy, please, can we go? [Jennifer] Sierra, come on.
-Sierra. -You're all right.
I'm gonna--look, it's gonna be all right.
I can't take you now. -Sierra, come on. -Let me go!
-Don't grab her like that. -Stop it, both of you. I love you, all right?
-Stop grabbing her like that. -What you doing, sierra? Huh?
It's gonna be all right, C.C.
What the deal? Why you gonna come up in here...
If you come up in front of me again, I swear to God,
If you come up in front of me again, I swear to God, you'll never see another daylight in your life.
-[man] Good morning. -Hi.
Excuse me.
...Exactly, and your eight o'clock appointment is all set.
-Okay. -Mr. Farnberg called.
Oh, and I was able to reschedule your hair appointment for next Tuesday.
-Okay. -Also...
What? Hey. What are you doing in here? I need, I needed to talk to you.
That's what I was trying to tell you, Mr. James is here.
Yeah, obviously. Did you just let him in my office?
Well, he said he's here to drive you home.
Call security. No, you ain't gotta call security.
I don't know what I was thinking coming here talking to you.
I'll just leave. I'm sorry.
What do you want from me?
I gotta talk to you about my kids.
-Maya, can you give us a second, please? -Yes, ma'am.
I gotta get my girls back.
Okay, what you need is a family law attorney, okay.
And if you can't afford one, the court will appoint one.
I can't walk in there with a public lawyer.
Their mama is spending a lot of money on a lawyer, and I need a bulldog like you--
Their mama is spending a lot of money on a lawyer, and I need a bulldog like you-- No offense.
Look, our firm charges $500 an hour. Can you afford that?
I got $1,200 to my name. -Look, mister... -No, no. Just call me Monty.
-Look, mister... -No, no. Just call me Monty. Look, sister, I'm trying to get--
-Typical. Typical. -What?
I thought more of you, but it's real typical. I'm not your sister, okay?
I don't appreciate you coming into my office asking for favors,
playing the race thing. It's sad and it's pathetic.
What are you getting out of this? -Hmm? -What?
Why do you want your daughters back so badly?
You getting a check for them, or some sort of government assistance?
Go to hell.
Wow. That, that, my friend, is exactly how you get what you want--
Insult me. Great strategy. I see why you're so successful.
Get a man, get a life.
Thank you.
Excuse me, are any of you ladies named Julia?
-No. -No.
Sorry to bother you. -Mm-hmm. -Mmm.
Julia?
-Christopher? -Yes.
-Please, call me Chris. -Sure.
-May I? -Oh, please. Sorry.
Um, I'm sorry for staring,
it's just that you're beautiful than your friend said.
Thank you. You're welcome.
-So, you're a lawyer. -Yes, I am.
Me, too. -Really? -Mm-hmm.
Mostly corporate stuff, tax stuff, it's pretty boring. What about you?
Our firm handles some criminal, some civil.
-Okay. What firm? -Rossmore and Blake. Oh.
-Hmm. -What? I applied for a job there, and they turned me down.
I applied for a job there, and they turned me down.
Said that my resume was a little bit shallow.
That's what the old fart said.
What's he...How's he doing these days? He, uh, retired to Florida.
Oh, you keep up with him? He's my father, the fart.
Check, please.
I'm sorry. That was embarrassing. Don't worry about it.
He can be a little tough on people he doesn't know that well.
Hmm. Well, they must be big wingtips to fill.
Actually, I try to fill my own stilettos.
Touche. And I will try to keep my foot out of my mouth
for the rest of this conversation.
It's cute. You should leave it there.
[chuckles] Well, if it's what the lady like, then I will. Oh, I like.
Would you like anything to drink? Um, a latte would be great.
Okay. Coming right up.
Thank you, Jesus.
So, I had an amazing time.
This was one of the best dates I've ever been on.
Me, too.
I would like to see you again. Yeah? I'd like that.
Who the hell is this, Chris?
Uh, this is, uh...
-Baby, you're supposed-- -Who are you?
-Baby, you're supposed-- -Who are you? I was--i was just saying good-bye, ma'am.
Yeah, you better go, slut. You see, right now, this is his family.
Get away from my daddy, tramp! -Junior, i-- -Excuse me!
-Junior, i-- -Excuse me! You trying to be playing playa, huh?
Where is your wedding ring? I am so tired of you! Get in the car! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Where's your lawyer? Uh, sir, I can't afford one,
but I do have all my paperwork, Your Honor.
-And-- -Are you ready to begin? Uh, yes, sir.
-My kids were taken from me-- -The court is aware of that.
But first, I'd like to hear about the incident that happened at school.
Your honor, he gave my daughter weed to sell in school, so I had--
Mr. James has no evidence to support that allegation.
However, we have documentation that demonstrates
that Mr. James has a history of violent behavior.
Your Honor, look, I'm caught between a rock and a hard place here.
You know, the courts won't help me. My daughters are living with this man.
You know, what am I supposed to do right here?
[lawyer] Your Honor, not only are we requesting full custody with no visitation,
but also a restraining order against Mr. James.
He assaulted my client and threatened bodily injury.
Your Honor, this man is giving drugs to my kids!
What proof of that do you have? Absolutely none--
-Your honor? -Ms. Rossmore.
I'll be representing Mr. James.
I'd like to request a continuance at this time
so I might be brought up to speed.
[lawyer] Your Honor, this has gone on long enough. My client is ready to put this behind her.
Perhaps counsel might like to remind his client
that in family court, it's not what's best for the parent
but rather what's in the best interest of the child.
That being said,
I think these children need effective counsel.
[judge] Ms. Rossmore, you are appointed by the court as guardian for the children.
When I hear this case on the reset date, I want evidence, not just accusations and speculation.
I want evidence, not just accusations and speculation.
This case is continued for 30 days.
[Julia] Your Honor, during that time, we'd like to request full custody
to be granted to the father.
[judge] You're pushing your luck.
Full custody remains with the mother.
Father will have visitation one day a week. Adjourned.
You have really interesting taste in women.
Nah, that's not the girl I met in high school.
Nope. She's changed.
I think the hood has a way of bringing out the best and worst in people.
That's not just the hood, Monty, that's life.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
We had big dreams though. Big dreams. Then, I guess, you know, reality set in.
Big dreams. Then, I guess, you know, reality set in.
Really? What kind of dreams did you have?
I'm a mechanic, and, you know, I wanted to open my own shop.
-Oh. -I'm good with cars, you know, so that's my hustle.
You should open that shop one day.
Well, I had to use the money That I had saved on my kids.
-Oh. -It was worth it though.
You know, I think that parents sometimes,
they gotta give up their dreams so their kids can have one.
Thank you.
-Thank you so much. -All righty.
You giving me hope. Thank you.
Great. Cool. Okay.
Come by tomorrow evening after work. We're gonna have to do all this after hours.
Okay. And if you could bring any receipt that pertains to the kids' expenses
And if you could bring any receipt that pertains to the kids' expenses or anything else you could possibly think of
that can help us win the case... So, thank you.
[Maya] No, no, no. This needs to be addressed. He is the councilman.
[Maya] No, no, no. This needs to be addressed. He is the councilman. He needs to know what the real issues are.
You the one we elected, you supposed to do something.
Quite, quite please. One at a time. One at a time.
Yes, you, ma'am.
I'm scared to go to the mailbox on the first because they be watching me.
All right. Yes, sir.
That Joe boy has been selling drugs on this block for years.
Well, have you called the police? What good would that do?
He's been arrested five times, and he keeps coming back.
You gotta do something.
What did I miss?
Oh, more of the same. Still complaining.
Let me tell you why he's gonna keep getting off,
because none of you in this neighborhood will testify against him.
What if we did? I mean, what if we did testify?
Who's gonna protect us? -That's right! -Yeah!
You--they don't even come when you call them in this neighborhood now.
May I say something please? Yes, sir.
I've been in this neighborhood for almost 67 years.
I watched Dr. King walk this very street to go to the barber shop.
I remember Billie Holiday,
who checked into what used to be the only hotel in the south
that would allow black people, right here on Auburn Avenue.
What I remember most was we used to be a people that would take care of ourselves.
Nobody never gave us nothing. We all earned it.
We look at these politicians and ask for their help. It ain't up to them. It's up to us.
It ain't up to them. It's up to us.
And if we all stand up together, then maybe they'll come and help us.
That's the history of us as a people.
We have to get our neighborhood back.
[Monty] Wow, I can see my whole neighborhood up here.
It ain't but five, ten blocks, but,
it's a whole different world out there.
And the highway run right through-- -Monty, I have a question. -Yeah?
When did you and their grandmother file this with the family court?
Oh, pardon me. It was like a, a month before the fire.
There. See the date? Thank you.
So, you've been supporting these children their whole lives?
-Yeah. -Hmm.
"Hmm," what? No, you should be proud of that.
I'm--that's all I'm saying. You should be proud of that, it's...
I mean, judging from these passed years tax returns and how much you spend on them, it's commendable.
Don't be surprised.
I mean, I know the world will have you thinking
that, you know, brothers in hood don't look after their kids, but,
I mean, I know there's some that don't, but I do.
I love my kids, and I want them back.
Oh, well, you know, I think, I think we have enough info here
I think, I think we have enough info here to begin preparing a really, really solid case.
You know, there's something I have to ask though.
Yeah?
Are there any surprises in your past that I should know about?
-[telephone rings] -Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.
Yes?
Cynthia? No. No, no. I know it's 6:30. I'm not going.
'Cause I don't want to go on any more blind dates.
He was a 40-year-old rapper. No, I didn't hear his demo tape.
Bye. Uh--bye. Thank you, bye.
Sorry.
Why did you, Why'd you go on them dates? Hmm?
Why'd you go on them blind dates? Excuse me?
When I was driving you, you know, you had your home girl set you up on a blind date and I'm like,
on a blind date and I'm like, "Why you need that? You're so beautiful."
You really want to know?
I need to...[chuckles] I mean, I need to know. I mean...
Because it's really hard to meet a nice black man.
It--it is! It is.
And when you're in corporate America, like me,
the people you work with don't look like you.
And if you're a black woman that wants to actually date a black man,
kind of difficult.
No, seriously. And if you want a black man that has good credits,
actually wants to date a black woman... Mm-hmm.
...and doesn't play video games, Ho!
Good luck. Well, I love me some black women.
Where's my money?
I don't have it. We can see that.
[Joe] Oh, well, that's $700, kid.
See, now the problem is, that comes from queen bee's account.
And, as you can see, she a little pissed off about it.
Baby, you want to call this one?
Oh, baby, you gonna let me do it? -Oh, for sure. -Oh.
Go do what you do.
Now, kick his ass.
That's 150, 275!
That's a good 350 right there. Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!
Man, okay! Okay! Get him up out of here. Get him up out of here.
Get him up out of here!
Yo, light up my blowtorch. I'll be down there in about 20 minutes.
What you laughing for? That ain't funny!
I'm laughing at you, 'cause, baby, he deserves to be beat. Okay?
'cause, baby, he deserves to be beat. Okay?
It's a tough world out here, And I'm getting you ready for it.
Ain't nothing given to you, girl? No, you got to take it.
Now, I'm gonna wipe those little sweet dreams out of your head, okay, baby,
if it's not the last thing that I do.
Now, get your little black ass back in that bedroom before I have to smack it.
Now, get your little black ass back in that bedroom before I have to smack it. You looking at me though!
Oh, I'm about to come in there in a minute. I got a big belt.
[Julia] Okay, I think that's about enough for tonight.
[Monty] So, how's it looking? [Julia] Good. Good. I think we're gonna do well.
Come on. I'll walk you to your car. Thank you. Mm-hmm.
You know what? I forgot. I let my driver go home early.
Oh, well, you know, I'll take you home.
Thank you.
Is this how you're spending your birthday? -It's just another day. -Wow.
How old are you?
-You don't ask a woman that. -I just did. How old are you?
-How old are you? -Thirty-four.

I don't even know what that is. All I do is work.
Fun is where you make it.
Come on, I want to show you some fun.
You know, I don't think this is gonna be a good idea.
Sure it is.
Is it safe?
[chuckles] You're always safe with me. Come on.

-Cynthia. -What?
Your client's last settlement, his baby-mamma drama.
-How do you know he has kids? -Because. Are you kidding me?
-How do you know he has kids? -Because. Are you kidding me? It's not if he has kids, it's how many.
-Does he have kids? -How many?
-Three. -He has three children?
I'm so disappointed.
Are they all by the same mother? No, probably not.
Yes, they all have the same mother, I think. But it doesn't matter.
Just be careful. Don't fall for this guy, I'm telling you.
He will run up your credit,
have you in the swats wearing knock-off Gucci-- -Brenda. -What?
Relax, all right? She's not married.
She's just having fun.
Right? You're having fun. You're not falling in love.
And she needs to have some fun. Girl, you need to take the edge off.
Oh, you do.
-Shall we? -Whoa.
-Hey. Hey. -You all right?
-Feeling good? -Yeah, yeah.
You have fun last night except for the... [imitates retching]
Yeah, I'm fine. Uh...
What are you doing here?
Well, you know, I just thought I'd come check up on you.
And I realize, you know, you're doing all this work, but you haven't met the girls.
I have them tonight, so maybe you want to come by and meet 'em.
Great. Sounds good. All right. My place ain't as fly as yours, But, uh, how's seven o'clock?
My place ain't as fly as yours, But, uh, how's seven o'clock? That sounds great. That's great.
What's wrong with you? You still feel sick? [chuckles] No.
Maya, do you knock?
Well, I thought I did. I have the files you asked for.
Well, I thought I did. I have the files you asked for. Great. Okay, thank you. I'll get those later. Thank you, Maya.
Great. Okay, thank you. I'll get those later. Thank you, Maya. -Will you just-- -Thank you.
[Maya] I...
What is wrong with you?
I thought we agreed that we would work after hours.
Oh. Oh. I'm-- I'm sorry.
You know, you can't just come up to my office.
You know, it's a lot of, there's a lot of nosy people and...
My bad. You know, I just thought last night me and you--
No, no. I mean, well, I hope you're not offended. No, I should have called you.
-You understand, right? -Yeah.
-Great. Okay. -All right, cool.
-Great. -All right. -Thanks. -So, yeah.
Okay. -You look good. -Thank you for that.
Damn it.
So, your dad went to go get dinner? Yes.
Is it, um, is it far?
Maybe.
So, you have to be-- Don't come up in here like you know us.
[Lauryn] Oh, goodness.
I'm Lauryn. And these are my sisters, Sierra and China.
Where you meet my daddy at? We met at work.
I think you guys saw me in court the other day.
-Remember? -Oh, court? That was you? Yeah.
[chuckles] Hey, you look so much older.
What did you say your name was again? Julia.
Ain't that a white-girl name? Okay, now, we're supposed to be nice.
-China. -And say thank you
for helping my dad try to get custody of us.
Oh, it's no problem, really.
Well, you could try a little harder.
I been having migraines since I been living there.
-Migraines. -Bad migraines.
-I'm sorry. I'm trying. -Really bad.
-Hey. -Hey. -You made it. -Yeah.
-Hey, daddy. -Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Well, yeah, your kids are certainly gonna be lawyers
'cause they sure as heck grilled the hell out of me.
I bet they did.
Hi, girls. Whatcha doing? [all] Nothing.
And she's at school, but she is not a nice girl at all.
-No? -No.
Are you a nice lady? I try to be.
I like your hair. Don't you, C.C.?
It's all right.
-Looks like a weave to me. -[coughs]
No, it's not! -[Monty] Sierra. -What?
So rude.
-So rude. -Are you okay, Daddy?
No, I think it's time for you all to go to bed. No. No, please.
-Not yet. -Just five more minutes. -Not yet. -Good night.
-No. -Please.
-I want to talk to Ms. Julia. -Say good night.
Good night, Ms. Julia.
Good night.
Good night. Sierra?
Bye.
Bye.
[Julia] Tell me what you know.
You know what? I'll tell you what I do know.
I know that you, you're feeling me. But you won't let yourself go there because you,
you care more about what people think than your own happiness.
Am I right?
We can both act like, you know, the other night never happened, but we both know it did.
We can both act like, you know, the other night never happened, but we both know it did. I was drunk.
-No, no. -No, I was drunk.
You was being yourself, and like my momma used to say, God rest her soul,
a drunk man never tells no tales.
What?
-Touche. -Yeah.
So, your mom passed? Yeah.
My mom passed. I'm sorry to hear that.
-What about your dad? -Who?
-Your dad. -My dad. I don't know my dad.
I got a whole bunch of brothers and sisters that I don't know, but that's cool.
It's funny how life works out.
You never knew your dad, but my dad would have killed for a boy.
-For a boy. -For a boy.
-Didn't get one. -I know the feeling.
That man pushed me so hard. God.
[sighs] Well, I made partner in the firm before I was 28.
My parents retired to south beach.
I don't know, Ms. Julia. You know what? You and I,
we come from two different worlds, but,
well, there's something going on here, right?
-You want me to stop? -No.
-No? -No.
Oh, you on time today. Well, you know, I gotta--
Oh, my God.
What happened to you? Oh, some thugs tried to break in here.
I fought them out. Before that happened, one of them cut me.
-Are you all right? -Yeah, yeah. I'm all right.
Well, did you catch 'em?
It was just some, some crackhead trying to get some stuff.
Now, I'm getting too old for this, man. I'm tired of it.
They win.
You know, I was thinking,
I gotta get rid of this place. I gotta leave this neighborhood.
So, if you could get together what you can for a down payment,
and then you hit me up once a month
until we reach ten, plus interest,
you can have this place. Would you do that?
I mean, sure. What are you, what are you saying? You serious, man?
Yeah. This place is officially yours.
I mean, I didn't want it like this. No. Me neither.
You gotta let me come back and help you from time to time.
Any time you're ready, man.
All right.
Oh, man.
Congratulations.
Is he gonna be all right? He'll be fine.
Oh, wow, wow, wow. I see it. Oh, look at that.
-Do you see it, Ms. Julia? -I do. -Yeah. -Wow.
So, you know, I'm mad excited.
I'm gonna get my sign for my new garage.
-I know. -I know.
-Sounds great. -I know. I'm really excited about that.
-Congratulations. -Mm-hmm.
Julia? -Hey. -Hey.
What are you doing here?
-Nothing, we were just... -I'm Monty.
I remember you. Okay.
Can I talk to you for a sec? Yeah.
What are you doing with this man? -Look, we're just hanging out. -Are you serious? You like him?
-Look, we're just hanging out. -Are you serious? You like him?
He's a nice guy. Snap out of it, Julia.
You are a partner at your firm. The only black woman at that level.
What do you think your partners would think if they knew
you were sleeping around with the help?
Are you trying to ruin your life? [man] Whoa, whoa.
-Hey, Julia. How you doing? -Good. How you doing?
-Hey, baby, you ready? -Yeah.
Come on, guys.
I think there'll be some people who are disappointed in me about this.
I mean, you know who I am. I'm, I'm from the streets.
-I can't change that. -I'm not trying to change you.
-Do I embarrass you? -No.
I mean, it's obvious that I do, and that's okay. That's okay.
You just gotta tell me that.
Tell me the truth, so that way, I know how to deal with it.
Look, I don't, I don't know how I feel. Okay?
But I can't sit here and lie to you and say that I don't think about
But I can't sit here and lie to you and say that I don't think about who you are and what you have.
I do.
You have three daughters.
One of whom is almost as big as I am.
This is new for me, Monty, and it's different, and I'm trying.
I am trying, and you gotta give me credit for that.
Can we finish this conversation? Come on.
-No. -No? What do you--what...
I got my girls for, like, two more hours,
and I'm not gonna waste my time dealing with this.
But I will tell you something.
-You don't have three girls in your life, just you. -Monty. Monty.
-Monty. -Big guy, ain't he?
-He's pretty. -Ain't he? A lot of them are.
-Look at that one. -Look at that one. He's bigger than all of them.
Yeah.
No, he did not bring this chick to my house either.
Watch the seatbelt. -Okay, Daddy. -Come on.
See you later. [Jennifer] Come on. Y'all, hurry up.
Bye, Ms. Julia. All right.
-I love you. -You, too. Now, be good, all right?
-[Jennifer] Come on, y'all. -My butterfly. Go ahead.
Come on, y'all. Hurry up.
Shoot, I been standing out here all night, and I'm tired, too.
Y'all think y'all the only ones tired? Shoot, and y'all...
Just let me explain, Monty.
The last man that I loved, he hurt me to my soul.
We were together six years, and,
he told me it was over two days before his wedding.
I trusted him with everything.
And I've never felt so low and stupid and humiliated in my life.
And so I told myself not to think about you.
But I couldn't, 'cause I do all the time.
So, what are you saying?
I'm saying that I've been running from something that already happened, and I'm saying that
that already happened, and I'm saying that I fell in love with you, Monty James,
And I'm saying that I hope I'm not in this alone.
You're not.
You're not alone.
Come here.
Your Honor, the children's own grandmother,
their maternal grandmother at that, went down to child welfare
and prepared a written statement as to why the children should be placed with their father.
Let me see that.
Did you know about this? [Jennifer] Oh, I don't know nothing about this.
I don't know what they trying to pull now.
Your Honor, my client has the means to take care of these girls,
and she wants to take care--
Iit says here that her mother thought the means were ill-gotten.
Well, that's-- that's pure-- [judge] What do you do for living, Ms. Jackson?
Well, I--well, I don't work, Your Honor. But my boyfriend does.
What does he do?
Well, he, you know, I mean, he owns his own businesses.
[judge] And where are the tax returns?
Well, you know, we was working on getting 'em,
and you know what, Your Honor? You keep asking me about my stuff.
You need to be asking Monty about some of his secrets,
'cause he got a whole lot of 'em.
What is she talking about?
[lawyer] Your Honor, Mr. James was convicted of the rape of a 16-year-old girl 16 years ago, and we're afraid for the safety of the children.
16 years ago, and we're afraid for the safety of the children.
Counselor, what do you have to say about this? Um...
I wasn't aware, Your Honor.
[lawyer] It's right here in black and white. Yeah, he was sentenced to eight years,
has been on probation ever since his release.
I'll take this matter under advisement.
I need to review the circumstances of this case.
Adjourned.
So, how long has he been screwing you, huh? 'Cause I know he can't afford you.
-Move. -Hey. -Move. -Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'll have to tap that ass.
-Move. -Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'll have to tap that ass.
Let me explain. Let me explain something.
-Get away from me. -Hold on. Hold on. Let me--
-Get your hands off of me! -Wait, let me explain.
-Get your hands off of me! -Wait, let me explain. -You know what? Shut up! -Shut the hell up!
-You know what? Shut up! -Shut the hell up! I can't even stand to look at you right now.
I asked you if there were any surprises. You said no. You're a rapist.
You said no. You're a rapist.
You don't think that's something I should have known about? -Julia, let me-- -Don't you touch me!
-Julia, let me-- -Don't you touch me!
Julia, look, look. Look--
Let me ask you a question. Did you or did you not go to jail for rape?
-Julia, look-- -Did you go to jail-- -Julia, look! -Did you go to jail for rape, Monty?
-Julia, look! -Did you go to jail for rape, Monty? -Yes. -That's all I need to know.
-No, I-- -You know what?
-No, I-- -You know what? It doesn't even matter 'cause you're a liar, Monty.
You're a filthy, God, you're filthy liar. This case is over.
Maya will call you and tell you when to return for the ruling.
You don't need me any more, Monty, And I certainly don't need you.
So, you like him that much?
-I fell in love with him. -Oh, Julia.
Sweetie, this was supposed to be a fun thing, not a love thing.
I know.
Go ahead, Bren. Tell me I told you so.
Oh, girl, you know I'm not gonna do that.
It's just good that you found out now.
I'm with Brenda on this.
Julia, this guy was probably just after your money.
He wasn't even like that.
You know, you guys, he was a hard worker. You know, I mean, and he treated, God, he treats those girls
You know, I mean, and he treated, God, he treats those girls like they are princesses.
Well, let's not forget he has a record.
How'd I not know he was lying?
Because he's probably really good at it. They all are.
It's like I'm, I'm hearing it, you guys, and I'm trying to understand, but I just--it-- it doesn't make sense.
but I just--it-- it doesn't make sense.
You know?
And I can't make my brain believe that it was all a lie.
Is it as bad as it sounds?
Honey, it's as bad as it sounds.
Jules, just... Do yourself a favor.
Forget about this guy.
He sounds like a lot of trouble.
Okay?
I just want to say...
It was like a...
[automated voice] Hi, this is Julia. Leave a message.
Who that?
What you all doing here? Come on in here.
What you all doing here?
Huh? Where your mama at?
What happened, C.C.? What happened? Huh? Huh?
Daddy, we don't really care what the judge says.
We just want to be with you.
I'm staying here.
-How did y'all get here? -We walked.
Y'all walked at three o'clock in the morning?
We can't stay there anymore, Dad. I'm sorry.
What you talking... -Daddy? -What happened?
-Daddy? -What happened? Joe...
Joe what? C.C., you can talk to me. You tell me what, what happened?
-Joe keeps-- -He keeps what?
Joe keeps hitting China.
What?
Where? Come here. Where? -On my back. -On your back?
-On my back. -On your back?
And mama was sitting right there. She didn't even say anything.
He hit--hold on. Hold on a second. Come here. He hit you? Hmm?
He hit me because I wouldn't stop crying. Okay.
Daddy, I was so sad. I couldn't help it.
Okay, come here. Come here. We...
Grandma told me, Grandma told me to look after you all.
I gotta look after you all. Mmm?
So, y'all gonna stay with me now.
Y'all gonna stay with me now, okay?
Okay?
C.C., I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.
Okay. You're gonna stay with me. It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.
[man] Ah. Wait. Hold up.
Monty. Monty! Man, come on!
There's some girls over here, man!
Monty, what are you doing, man?
Come on! What's taking you so long.
-[Monty] I'm Monty. -We know who you are.
You beat our team.
-How old are you? -Eighteen.
You know, this sure is a nice place you have here.
Um, you want to see my room?
-[Monty] Sure. -[girl] So, you gonna call me? [Monty] Probably not.
Oh, you're just like all the other guys.
Mandy, what are you doing? Did he force you?
-[Monty] No way! Tell him! -Mandy?
-Yes, Daddy. -What?
Sir, I didn't do anything. -Shut up! -I didn't do anything.
Shut up! -It was her idea. -Shut up, superstar!
-Tell him! -Call the police. I didn't do anything. Tell him, Amanda.
I didn't do anything. Tell him, Amanda. If you don't tell him the truth, I'm going to jail. Tell him the truth!
If you don't tell him the truth, I'm going to jail. Tell him the truth! Your ball days are over! You got me?
-I didn't do nothing! -Shut up right now!
[Julia] Get your hands off of me. I can't even stand to look at you.
You're a rapist! [echoing] You're a rapist! You're a rapist!
[Jennifer] I bet you he won't ever take our money again.
[Joe] I know that's right. You gotta keep 'em straight, J.
You know I got your back, right, baby?
That's why you my girl.
You know, I want to go see that movie with the dude with the ax,
no, no, no, it's the chainsaw. Baby, you know, if we went to see that movie--
Baby, you know, if we went to see that movie--
Check it out.
Oh, snap! Load up! Load up!
Do something!
[newscaster] Tthere was a near-riot today in the Edgewood community.
Police officers were called in to break up a fight
between local gang members and residents who had had enough.
Among those arrested was Monty James.
You may remember Monty James, a high school basketball star
who was falsely convicted in 1990
for allegedly having non-consensual sex with a 17-year-old girl--
I'm assuming you have admissible evidence this time?
Yes, Your Honor.
The police seized several pounds of marijuana hidden in the defendant's vehicle.
of marijuana hidden in the defendant's vehicle.
A subsequent search of the residence
turned up several kilograms of crack cocaine.
This time, Your Honor, we have a valid warrant.
Your Honor, even though they served the search warrant, they still have no witnesses.
Your Honor, I'll testify.
Congratulations! It looks like you have a case.
Take them into custody. There will be no bond.
-Next case. -Wait, get your hand off me!
[bailiff] The state of Georgia versus Monty James.
Order! Order in this court! All of you, be quiet! Or I'll have you removed!
I will have order!
Order!
Order!
I said order!
Who's here for the defense? I am, Your Honor.
Ms. Rossmore?
May I take a second, please?
What you doing here? I'm sorry.
I didn't give you a chance to explain, and if you don't ever want to speak to me again,
I didn't give you a chance to explain, and if you don't ever want to speak to me again, I completely understand.
Let me help you.
Monty, just let me help you.
Just get me back to my kids.
Ms. Rossmore?
Your Honor, there's no evidence my client committed any criminal act.
The state has no case against him.
We demand a preliminary hearing
and request the state be required to show probable cause.
Your Honor, I'm sure that one of these witnesses can attest to the fact that Mr. James
can attest to the fact that Mr. James drove his vehicle into the previous defendant's vehicle.
It was an accident.
I'm sure that the subsequent fistfight was an accident also then, counselor.
Where are the witnesses?
Your Honor, the entire neighborhood saw this.
I'm sure we have a witness.
May I have one of the witnesses. Please stand at this time?
-Your Honor-- -I'm dismissing the case.
I love you.
And I'm sorry for everything.
[Monty] Oh, man! Forget about it! I can't believe this! Yo! The whole neighborhood!
I can't believe this! Yo! The whole neighborhood! [alll] Daddy!
[alll] Daddy!
Come here, baby.
Two men.
Approximately
40 goats.
They're not on anybody's side. We don't have to shoot them.
Egress?
Primary over the top, secondary down the road, tertiary to the river.
No one can track you through the water except a fish.
Sarah's headed off to nursing' school next month.
She sewed that herself.
It's beautiful.
You sure this is a peacekeeping mission?
Normally there isn't any peace to start with.
This shit's awful calm.
-Not at these coordinates. -Yes, sir.
Go ahead and plot an alternate.
Yes, sir.
[man over radio] Command Post, Command Post, this is TS-129, over.
Sir, I have visual confirmation of TS-129's current position.
[man 1] Mission accomplished, en route to extract site. Distance eight klicks. Over.
[Donnie] Command Post, Command Post, this is Viper.
I have friendly forces moving towards extraction point, over.
Heads up, our boys are coming through.
[man] Viper, this is CP. Be advised,

[Swagger] Call them out.

-Packing up. -Shit!

Command Post, do you read me?
Shut it down.
They're highly-trained men,
eight kilometers inside a country we are not supposed to be in.
I'm sure they'll get out just fine. Shut it down now.
[Donnie] Radio check. Do you read me?
-Okay, wrap it up. Let's go! -Do you read me?
[man 1] Pull out those tracks. [man 2] Pull out those tracks and pack it up!
Intelligence said they didn't have air support!
Call it in!
Shit! The channel's down!
That's impossible! The comm link's dead!
They left us here. Don't worry, we're getting home!
[screams] Donnie?
Donnie!
Come on, boy!
Come on, Sam!
What're you doing, huh? What're you doing?
Come on.
What? I got nothing.
What?
All right, come on, let's go. Let's go.
That's a good boy.
Good boy.
Well, let's see what lies they're trying to sell us today.
Here, boy.
Good boy.
[Sandor] Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger.
USMC, retired.
He is the best there is.
[Dobbler] His last assignment went wrong.
Put in unfriendly territory on a loan-out and left as expendable.
Opposing force sent an attack helicopter
and a hundred-man company.
His best friend and spotter was killed.
No official report.
Ghost report says he inflicted 70 percent casualties, the rest fled.
The agency asset that left them there to die?
Suddenly removed from the face of the earth two weeks after.
They never laid it at Bob Lee's feet.
He retired a week later.
I guess Bob Lee didn't think he was expendable.
[Johnson] Grows and shoots his own food.
[Dobbler] Yeah, he rarely ventures out at all.
This is a man with a history of duty and patriotism.
Not as punch lines, but as core beliefs. Aye.
Some people don't know what to do when their belief system collapses.
Bob Lee is one of those.
You sure, boy?
Nope. I ain't buying. I don't want any.
You guys turn around and go back to wherever you came from.
Bob Lee Swagger?
My name is Colonel Isaac Johnson.
You're a hard man to find.
But not hard enough.
Come a long way to see you.
We have some business needs your attention.
You wanna use your low gear going down the road
or your brakes'll go.
-Come here. Come here, boy. -[Sam snarling] Don't do that.
Come near the porch I didn't invite you, you'd have to shoot the dog.
That's a slow draw you got there.
Sure you want to do that?
Shoot a dog in this county on a man's land,
I'd bury you in the hill, and tell the sheriff a month or two later.
He understands.
Take your hand off your weapon.
Slowly.
So the gunnery sergeant doesn't have to bury you in the hill.
I don't carry a gun.
You know what that is?
It's a Congressional Medal of Honor.
They don't hand those out easy.
Yours?
Yeah.
Your father had one, didn't he?
What did you do?
Something foolhardy. Kept some other boys alive.
Will you give me five minutes?
Yeah, your dog stays outside.
Come on, boy. Get in there.
I need you to plan a presidential assassination.
Whose president?
Ours.
I didn't say "execute".
Plan.
So it can be stopped.
There's gonna be an attempt on the life of the President in the next two weeks.
Code was broken on an anonymous transmission.
It was internal.
We can't go to the usual agencies.
The government itself has been penetrated.
The President has three public engagements during that time.
Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.
Standard Secret Service protective cordon
is out to 880 yards.
But this intercept claims that the shot will be taken from beyond a mile.
We need you to scout, tell us how you would do it,
so we could stop it.
I'm not entirely convinced that a shot like this could be made.
But let's not take the chance.
Your longer shots were never confirmed.
That's because long shots generally go places
you wouldn't wanna have to go afterwards to confirm them.
Confirmation's a desk pogue's problem.
You know what it takes to make a shot at that range?
Everything comes into play that far.
Humidity, elevation, temperature, wind, spindrift.
There's a 6-to-10-second flight time
so you have to shoot at where the target's going to be.
Even the Coriolis effect, the spin of the Earth, comes into play.
President'll be wearing body armor. That means a head shot.
At over a mile.
You believe there's a shooter involved capable of making this shot?
Yes.
Well, then you got a real problem. You need to find the shooter.
That's being worked on from another direction.
We need you to do this.
Don't really like the President much.
Didn't like the one before that much, either.
You like the idea of the President?
Living in a free country?
Do we allow America to be ruled by thugs?
Sure, some years we do.
I believe you stood before a flag
and solemnly swore
that you'd support and defend the Constitution of the United States
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.
I think your five minutes is up.
Listen to me, son.
I don't want you to turn on the TV next week
and see the President dead,
and know you could've done something about it.
Don't do that to yourself.
[Swagger] Is that the new one?
The truck.
You got the big engine in there?
Wow, look at that, huh? Eight-liter V8.
Thing's so big, EPA doesn't even bother to give you the gas mileage for it.
You mind if I take a picture?
This is beautiful.
Someone will be at this number night or day.
You see what he did? He didn't need a photo of the engine.
No, he doesn't give a rat's ass about the engine.
He's trained in counterintel.
Backed up far enough to take a picture of the plates.
This is our guy.
I thought he turned you down.
He said yes. He just doesn't know it yet.
1,760's a mile.
It's a far piece, Sam. Think the President ought to worry?
Yeah, I think he better worry.
Yeah, he'll be fine.
Just feed him once a day. Read him a few ballistics tables if he looks lonely.
Yep. I'm out.
Come here, buddy.
Okay.
Think you'll be able to tough it out without me for a couple days? Huh?
Yeah.
[man on radio] This is Command Post. What's your status? Over.
[man 2] Yeah, we're finishing up here on sixth.
[man 1] Roger that. We copy. Checkpoint down, over.
[man] Before you stands Independence Hall, the birthplace of the United States
and one of the most important buildings in American history.
Built in 1732…
[man 2] Keep a visual eye on 72nd.
…both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution
were debated and signed here.
[Swagger] Out of the three cities,
there's only one with a reasonably high chance of success.
There was no room in Baltimore.
Street isn't wide enough to correct for the windage,
buildings are in the way.
D.C.'s a pure suicide mission.
I mean, unless you're sure your shooter's interested in 70 virgins
waiting for him in the afterlife,
I'd rule that out.
Shot's got to be taken from Philly.
From beyond 1,800 yards, though.
It's one of six possible locations,
approximately five stories above the President's location.
Flight time of the bullet that distance is five to six seconds.
They'll have to wait till he takes the podium,
several lines into his speech.
That way he'd be completely static, obviously at his most exposed.
Shot requires a large-caliber weapon.
Expect the bullet to be handmade, bronzed alloy turned on a lathe.
Slightly lower ballistics coefficient,
touch more slippery.
Least that's what I'd do.
You can kill him from that far away?
Mile and a half, the bullet's going to strike with more energy
than a .44 Magnum point blank.
Yeah, I think you can kill him.
The challenge is the wind.
Lightest breeze uncorrected at that distance
is enough to ruin the shot.
He's gonna need indicators between the podium and the shooting position.
Velocity corrections are easy,
but an angle change, that becomes a trig problem.
He's gotta do that in his head on the fly.
Without something to gauge, your shot's just too tough to make cold bore.
[Johnson] Impressive recon and report, son.
Move too soon, we lose him.
We want to take him alive.
If we don't know who hired him, it could just happen again.
We'll have six three-man teams standing by.
Gunnery Sergeant Swagger?
A moment?
You've done your country a great service, son.
-On the day… -Look…
Listen.
You're one of the few people who knows what to look for.
I could use a spotter.
[man] Thank you, Philadelphia.
The President speaks in 20 minutes.
…before you on this stage…
[Johnson] Notify our teams. Check their positions.
…patriots met in Independence Hall and created a document,
the Declaration of Independence…
[officer] Sir?
…and a country, the United States of America,
that changed the world.
Philadelphia is our home. We are…
[man 1 on radio] Stand by, all teams. This is Listening Post.
Flashlight's current location is approaching Checkpoint Jason.
All sniper teams send update on your sitrep.
Stand by. [man 2] Yes, I have a clear line of sight.
[woman on radio] Copy that.
[man] Post 18 clear, over.
[woman] Post 19, please report. What's your status?
All clear. There's really nothing going on here.
[man] The Archbishop of Ethiopia…
[newscaster 1] The President will be awarding the Philadelphia Brotherhood Medal
to His Grace Desmond Mutumbo, the Archbishop of Ethiopia.
[newscaster 2] There's been some controversy surrounding the Archbishop
as he's been speaking out regarding the atrocities in his country.
He plans to meet with the President right after the ceremony
to discuss these matters.
[Archbishop] These are great times.
[Archbishop] These are historic times.
And these are troubled times, as well.
This medal that your country…
[Swagger] Yellow ribbons.
Yeah, people put those up to remember the troops.
No, they tie those low around trees.
These are windage flags.
Roughly the location I'd have put them in
for a shot from the steeple.
Yeah. Maybe.
No, definitely. He knows what he's doing.
You guys got a team in place to take out the church?
They'll move right before the shot is taken, when his focus is elsewhere.
[Archbishop] …raises its head and confronts freedom,
but slyly, subtly, chokes it off at the root.
And it is our responsibility
to find these dark weeds.
[man] Flashlight has arrived. I say again, Flashlight has arrived.
Phew! [woman] If you just joined us…
Officer Timmons, our local resource.
Bob Lee Swagger.
It is a real honor to meet you.
You're unsnapped, officer.
Shit. Oh, fuck.
Don't want to lose that now, do I?
Again, it's an honor.
[Archbishop] …of our stewardship of this great…
[Swagger] That our guy in the collar? [Johnson] The Archbishop of Ethiopia.
He's getting a medal. Know it?
HOA. Horn of Africa. Yeah.
You know I worked there?
You know what they say about the first thing that you feel
You know what they say about the first thing that you feel when you shoot a civilian?
-Recoil of your rifle? -Right.
[Swagger] That's very original.
[announcer] Thank you, Archbishop, for those inspiring words.
[Johnson] The President speaks next.
All teams stand by.
[man on radio] Agent Gibson, we read your fly-by. Situation all clear, over.
[man 2] Agent James, all clear.
[announcer] Now it gives me enormous pleasure…
-Got wind at three, full value. -…to introduce to you
the President of the United States.
Make it four-and-a-half minutes of angle.
Three-mil hold, in case the wind dies.
He's loaded.
Altitude, humidity, temperature accounted for.
[president] In the city that was the capital of…
[Swagger] We gotta take him.
Ten seconds.
Wind matches his setup. Take him! Take him now!
Send in the ERT team. Take out the…
[man] Shots fired! Shots fired!
[man on radio] Flashlight is down, Flashlight is down.
-What? Flashlight down? -I say again, Flashlight is down.
[newscaster 1] The President has been shot. [newscaster 2] There's mass confusion…
Has the President been shot?
[man] Right at the church steeple.
[Payne] How could you miss?
How could you fucking miss?
Thirty seconds, clear out. Chase him down.
He's bleeding. Kill him.
[man 1] Command Post to Condor Two, load up, over.
[man 2] Condor Two loading up.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Hurry up, guys. Come on.
[man] Condor Two, this is Command Post. Stand by for update, over.
[man 2] Standing by, over.
Command Post!
Command Post! Command Post,
this is Post 19. You guys read me?
-Should I hold post? -Please.
Please help me. Please. They shot me.
FBI. Put your hands up! Please. Hey.
Save me.
What?
Give me the keys.
I didn't shoot the President. Timmons was a setup.
-[car alarm beeping] -Help!
FBI! Took my weapon and my car.
Don't worry, I already shot him twice. You all right?
[man 1] CP, 17, can you repeat possible suspect description?
[woman 1] Negative, no further at this time.
[woman 2] CP, this is 15. No activity at my location.
I am available to move if necessary.
[woman 1] Copy that.
[Timmons on radio] This is Officer Timmons requesting backup.
Pursuing suspect in assassination.
Now fleeing in stolen FBI vehicle, moving south on Front from Diamond.
Suspect is armed and dangerous. I repeat,
suspect is armed and dangerous.
[woman 1] All Philly PD units be advised,
assassination suspect is fleeing in a stolen FBI vehicle.
He is going south on Front from Diamond.
[man 2] This is Condor 2. We are transitioning from roadhouse to Front Street.
Please advise for further description of suspect vehicle.
[woman 1] Dispatch, 419, I'm heading south on Thompson.
Do we have a color, anything on the vehicle?
[woman 1] Assassination suspects vehicle
is one government-issue black 2006 Ford Crown Vic.
Pennsylvania license number 7-3-1-7 James David Edward, over.
[man] What was suspect's last known location? Over.
[woman 1] Last known is south on Front.
Do we have multiple suspects or a single suspect?
[woman 1] Agent James, negative. No further information…
[man 1] This is Agent Pittman. Car seen going high speed on Castor.
High speed on Castor. Be advised.
Timmons called it in?
Right on time, like he was supposed to.
-Before he shot him again. -Well, he's been hit twice,
so unless he can stop the bleeding without going to the hospital or a doctor,
it doesn't really matter.
They're going to find him lying dead by a dumpster in an alley in 20 minutes.
[man 1] What is your location?
[man 1] Suspect vehicle a black sedan, four-door…
[woman 1] All units be advised,
eyewitness reports suspect vehicle entering High-Tech Car Wash
on the northwest corner of Girard and 9th, over.
[man 2] Command Post be advised,
this is Condor Two en route to suspect location, over.
[man 3] Command Post, Condor Three copies. All en route.
-Yo, man! -Watch it, man!
Shit!
[man 2] Command Post, Condors Two and Three moving to intercept, over.2
[officer 1] Suspect vehicle collided with a truck under the 95.
He's at Market and Columbus.
[officer 1] Looks good. Vehicle is disabled. Repeat, vehicle disabled.
[officer] Take him down! Fire!
I got a Crown Vic. Black. Government plates.
Dead guy in the front seat?
I want the banks of this river lined for 30 miles, five minutes ago.
All right. Let's start the search downriver.
[reporter] I'm here with Officer Timmons, who pursued the suspect on foot.
Officer, can you tell us what happened?
[newscaster 1] The would-be assassin, tentatively identified
as retired Marine Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger,
is being pursued by thousands of State and Federal law enforcement personnel
State and Federal law enforcement personnel as we speak.
[newscaster 2] As the net begins to tighten nationwide, there is still no trace of Swagger.
Nothing but an abandoned car has been found
at the bottom of the Delaware River.
[newscaster 3] Seven-year veteran Philadelphia police officer Stanley Timmons,
first to respond to the scene,
is believed to have shot and injured Swagger.
Early reports indicate that the assailant
may have been hit as many as two times.
Meanwhile, the FBI has been unwilling to comment
on information that an agent of theirs
was assaulted and disarmed by Swagger as he fled the scene,
possibly in a stolen FBI vehicle.
At this time, no sign of Swagger has been found.
You have embarrassed this office.
You will be facing a review from the Office of Professional Responsibility.
Sir…
Well, I don't feel embarrassed.
A Force Recon Marine Scout Sniper
disarmed me three weeks out of the academy.
If anything, I feel lucky to be alive.
Why'd he say he didn't shoot the President?
Because he didn't.
Also, he said Timmons was a setup.
He never said that.
City cop managed to spot, shoot this guy twice.
You got your ass kicked.
You're misremembering.
That's normal under extreme stress events.
Have you given your official statement yet?
Because I would be very cautious about what went in it.
Well, maybe I should wait for the report to come out, read it and then remember.
[man whispering] Can you believe this fucking guy?
There you go.
Yes?
The raw feeds are in from the networks.
[newscaster 1] …development, security camera footage from Washington, D.C.
and several locations in Philadelphia
shows the suspect, Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger,
scouting shooting locations, traveling and taking wind readings.
As the net begins to tighten nationwide, there is still no trace of Swagger.
Excuse me.
Can't sell you nothing. Just lost our power.
Please. I got cash, and you can keep the change.
Ain't gonna be able to find nothing.
Please, all I need is a marinade needle, some salt, some sugar,
couple bottles of water.
How many?
[Memphis] Well, sir, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sure she's a really nice Christian woman,
but we don't take care of those things here.
Yeah. Okay, well…
[newscaster] The FBI released a video letter threatening the life of the President.
…see a counselor. Dr. Phil or something. Okay.
…see a counselor. Dr. Phil or something. Okay. …signed and dated by Bob Lee Swagger just 10 days ago.
[newscaster 2] Federal agents today executed a search warrant
in the Wind River range of Wyoming
where Swagger had been living for several years.
In the meantime, the FBI has been unwilling to comment,
as no sign of Swagger has been found.
-Get anything? -No.
Yeah, wait, wait. Where was this?
[Turner] And? Yes? She thinks it was him, but it was dark because the power was out in the store.
-What'd he buy? -[man] Gotta be.
Uh, salt, sugar, water, and a marinade injector.
Guy going to a barbecue.
Salt, water, an injector could be used for an IV,
but what's with the sugar?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold that! Hold that!
Well, sugar's been used to treat battlefield wounds
for hundreds of years.
It has something to do with osmotic pressure.
It was popular during the Napoleonic War.
Uh-huh. You go into Howard's office with the Napoleonic War,
he's gonna put you on psych leave.
Go back to your desk. I'm saving your life.
-[gunshot] -One thing is…
…1790 to 1800.
-One thing is… -[gunshot]
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.
I know who you are.
You're Bob Lee. Swagger. Donnie's old partner.
Look, I didn't shoot the President.
I know.
You do?
The President's not dead. Ethiopian Archbishop is.
Why in the hell would somebody want to shoot him?
Look, you're a nurse, right?
No. No, that was Donnie's dream. I couldn't stand the blood.
I teach the third grade.
-Please. -Look, you should go.
Please.
Please?
I didn't do whatever they said I did.
I swear.
I'm in some bad trouble and I need some help.
I wouldn't have come all the way here to lie to you.
You still figuring on shooting me?
Only that shotgun's a little long to bring up fast.
Look, if you're going to do it, just get it over with.
I ain't got nowhere else to go.
Pull the truck in the garage. The neighbors will be up in a minute.
You'd best call me Sarah.
All right.
[woman] 911, what's your emergency?
Hello?
[woman] This is 911. We received a hang-up from this location.
Yeah, neighbor's dog knocked over the trash cans
and scared the hell out of me. Everything's fine. Thanks.
Okay, then.
Seems you call the police and hang up without saying anything,
they call you back right away.
I should've come and seen you in person.
Before. I mean, then.
Yeah, I read the letter.
It was okay.
And once a year I got the flowers.
You don't look real good.
I'm supposed to be dead. Been a long night.
Why aren't you?
Well, the U.S. government spent a lot of time and money
teaching me how not to die
after they got done teaching me how to kill people.
So how is it I'm supposed to help you?
You can do a running cross-stitch, finish it with an embroidery knot?
Yeah.
You got to try to spread it out.
It's gonna look odd you buy it all in one place.
How can it be three years ago when it seems like ten?
Mileage can be rough.
No one ever beats me in.
You never left.
Everyone keeps telling me I'm crazy.
Like I didn't see what I saw, or heard what I heard.
I'm not crazy, though. You think I'm crazy?
Where did all this stuff come from?
At first I thought it was Washington, Quantico.
I checked and it didn't. It just magically arrived.
Cooperating agencies, ATF, NRO, places that don't even have initials
they cooperate in times of national emergency.
You need to get some sleep.
You know that the first ballistics diagram got here
22 minutes after the shooting.
We're good at our jobs.
12 minutes after the shooting, they were still scrambling choppers.
The scene was locked down.
How did they get a reverse azimuth ten minutes after that?
I mean, we work for the federal government.
We're not that good at our jobs.
[Memphis] You want to see something? [woman] Probably not.
[Memphis] I downloaded this.
This is a full-scale printout
of a target Swagger shot two years ago at 1,000 yards.
I punched in the holes myself. It was at a competition.
I read an article. It said Swagger shot a silver dollar at a grand.
Five shots,
at 1,000 yards,
an inch-and-a-half spread. An inch and a half!
It was the capital of the United States…
That's the flag behind the President. It's barely waving.
This is the wind speed and direction
according to the National Weather Service
at the time of the shot. I did the math.
Now, how does a man who can do that
miss by two-and-a-half feet at 2,000 yards?
I don't get it.
[woman] You had a long night. Let it go and get some sleep.
You know, I saw Timmons interviewed.
He said he was walking foot patrol,
saw a rifle barrel sticking out of a window,
went upstairs to investigate, and shot Swagger.
No sniper sticks his rifle out of a window.
They shoot from cover, back in the room.
It doesn't make any sense.
-I'm gonna talk to Timmons. -No, you're not.
Why? 'Cause they're gonna fire me if I do?
Timmons was killed by a mugger in an alley last night.
In a conspiracy, all loose ends are trimmed.
Jack Ruby shoots Oswald?
Bad things happen to good people.
Yeah, not that quick, they don't.
Well, I stopped the bleeding temporarily.
But it'll cut loose again.
I held off the worst of the infection, but you're gonna have to open it up,
cut out and scrub away anything that's dead,
working your way out, sewing it together
and you got to try to make sure you don't re-infect it.
You ready for this?
I'm going to do all those Whip-it's and pass out.
Good luck, okay?
[Johnson] I need you to plan a presidential assassination.
[Swagger] That our guy in the collar?
Whose president?
[Johnson] I didn't say "execute".
He's getting a medal. Know it?
The Archbishop of Ethiopia.
[Swagger] You need to find the shooter.
No.
Two-and-a-half days, shot twice, no sign?
Find me something.
Maybe he crawled into a hole and died.
He's not dead.
Tear apart his life.
Again.
Go okay?
I've been hallucinating.
Something I need to tell you.
Ralphie's dead.
Who's Ralphie?
Well, they said you shot your dog
'cause you knew you weren't coming back.
They said that, huh?
Name was Sam.
He was a good dog. I raised him from a pup.
You okay?
No.
What are you gonna do?
I'll get better.
Then I'm going to burn their playhouse down.
Can I help you?
Hold still.
I been meaning to ask you.
You have a boyfriend?
Why?
Am I still supposed to be the grieving widow?
It's been three years.
No.
Just wonder if I'm gonna have to shoot somebody
walks through that door without knocking,
wondering where you've been.
Well, no.
Nothing steady. No boyfriend.
Not bad.
A little stiff, but…
Hey.
You know, you would've made one hell of a nurse.
That was really brave, what you did.
You saved my life.
I'm better. I better get to it.
They're never gonna stop chasing you.
Never.
They're never gonna stop looking.
In the meantime, they need someone else to find.
I'm going to give them him.
Excuse me?
May be a way to get two birds with that stone, too.
-Swagger? -Hey.
The gun Donnie learned to hunt with when he was a kid.
It ain't much, but it shoots true.
I cleaned and oiled it before I put it away.
You sure?
Yeah.
Why'd you go?
When they came to see you.
They know which buttons to press.
I'm still enough of a sucker, you press that patriot button,
I'll sit up in my chair and say, "Which way you want me to go, boss?"
I mean, I ain't real proud of it, but I ain't ashamed, either.
You know, I got a plan,
but I think I'm going to need your help.
Okay. I'll do it.
I haven't even told you what it is yet.
I know.
Look.
It was my fault.
What?
You know, with Donnie. I should never have…
What?
Don't you dare.
Don't you try and take that away from him.
He knew exactly what he was doing when he enlisted.
He knew exactly what he was doing
when he enrolled in scout sniper training.
He loved what he did.
No one made him do it.
That ain't yours to carry.
You're right.
I'm sorry I tried.
It's okay.
[Swagger] I need you to meet with this FBI agent.
Use him to flush Johnson out of his hiding place.
Give him the vehicle ID number. He'll do what he's trained to do.
You get in and get out. Don't get caught.
You get caught, I get caught.
[Sarah] You know what that is?
Says he didn't shoot no one, but I don't know.
Well, he's been staying with me.
Who's been staying with you? Bob Lee Swagger?
The plates are probably fake. Pretty sure the other number's real.
-And what is this? -A VIN number.
Seems no one goes through the trouble to change 'em anymore.
And you're going to sit real still until I'm long gone.
See the guy in the Eagles jacket?
[officer] Excuse me, sir. Can I see some ID, please?
Sir, I'm going to need you to take off your hat
and show me some ID.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Take your hat off, asshole!
Get on the ground! Get your ass on the ground!
[man] Hey, how's it going?
Hey, John.
-[man] Hey, Ed? -[Ed] Yeah.
[man] You got that Stevens file we wanted back?
How badly do you want to know? Because this will get you fired.
Well, I have to go before the Office of Professional Responsibility
in 45 minutes for a review.
I'm gonna get fired anyway. I'm done worrying about that.
What do you think?
I think that CNN got the tapes before we did,
already edited together to show the angles.
Who delivered them?
An unnamed agency who will never confirm or deny.
They denied, which is a…
Which is a confirmation of sorts.
Of what?
That you are asking questions way outside your pay grade.
Oh, come on, just tell me.
You don't want to be here for that review.
They don't have to stop at firing you. They can charge you and hold you.
The ASAC's job comes with Delta clearance.
-Thank you. -Go.
[Dobbler] This is a copy of a chat-room transcript.
These guys talk about everything. I didn't give it much thought at the time.
We just traced it to a donut shop with free Wi-Fi.
But this, this is a Delta-level clearance request
out of the FBI field office in Philadelphia seven minutes ago.
Funny thing, Google Maps puts the donut shop
only three blocks away from the field office.
There's only one guy who met with Swagger before he disappeared.
He lives in Philly.
And he works for the FBI.
Nicholas Memphis.
[Galindo] …really strange company. Contracts with a lot of the Fortune 500.
Offices in Virginia, Delaware, registered in Panama.
They own a boat that's flagged out of Libya.
They're definitely not government,
but they have high ex-military contacts like you wouldn't believe.
These are contractors.
I can't tell what this company does, but…
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
Memphis?
Memphis!
For a man who didn't know much,
you sure took a long, painful time to tell it.
Get him some water.
Good.
Got to pee yet?
Got to flush them drugs out of your system.
Look awful suspicious if you were to go and shoot yourself
pumped full of the same shit the agency uses.
I'm not going to shoot myself.
Sure you will.
Take him out. Get him ready.
No!
That's my gun.
Yeah.
You wrote a real touching suicide note, too.
All overwrought with guilt about your mistakes.
Quit your struggling.
This thing works. It's not the first time we've used it.
Russo. Russo!
Davis, get out here!
What is the goddamn hold-up?
Don't kill me, please! Don't kill me! I believe you!
Kill you?
Had enough chances. I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.
What kind of asshole'd think up a thing like this?
Not bad with a poodle shooter and a makeshift silencer, huh?
Help me toss these boys in the water?
You set me up and you used me as bait!
You think? Flushed them out, didn't it?
I was kind of hoping to keep one alive,
but they were kind of determined to kill you.
You can hire a good lawyer, and I'll call the Bureau.
They can work out some kind of deal.
This is explainable. You can prove that you didn't shoot the Archbishop.
I don't think you understand.
These boys killed my dog.
Hey, this is the 21st century. You can't go to war with these people.
In the end, the law is all…
In the end, the law'll never catch and hold them.
In a year or two, they'll be back in business.
New names, new messenger boys, same old story.
And I'll be dead.
It's gonna be some hard, hairy work, Pork.
There's gonna be more shooting, and more people are gonna die.
Now, I didn't start it, but be sure as hell I mean to see it through.
So you get it straight. You in or you out?
You know, I missed a meeting today
where I was going to get fired for unprofessional conduct
because I was kidnapped by people that don't exist.
I'll take his legs.
It's a good call, Pork.
You're trying to tell me a rookie FBI agent
overpowered and killed the three of them?
No.
They were shot from a distance of about 200 yards.
With a .22.
-Swagger's alive. -Yes.
And that young kid,
FBI Agent
Nick Memphis,
who managed to pry out a Delta-level clearance,
hasn't come back to the office and is out there with him.
What?
I just went over Swagger's financials again.
Once a year, he sent flowers to someone with his Visa card.
I cracked the FTD database, got an address.
Donnie Fenn's widow. Anniversary of his death.
She went back to using her maiden name,
which is why we missed it the first time.
She's maybe the only person in the entire world
that would believe anything that Swagger had to say.
Look. Keene City, Kentucky.
It's just within driving range.
What are you waiting for? Take the jet. All right.
We've given Swagger a new war,
he's found a new spotter.
This is about to get worse.
I think we're here.
Hey. Swagger.
I think we're here.
Welcome to Tennessee.
Patron state of shooting stuff.
Hey, who is this guy?
This guy was the greatest gunsmith east of the Mississippi. He's a legend.
He knows more about guns and the people who shoot them
than Smith & Wesson.
Don't really matter anymore. He knew we were coming the last three miles.
-You mind your manners. -All right.
You boys come a long way. What you looking for?
Wisdom.
You come to the wrong place.
Maybe.
Say a man wanted to fire a bullet from one rifle
and have it match exactly to another.
Could that be done?
Take a seat.
Have a chair, son.
If you could get a bullet that had been shot clean through the first rifle,
could make the grooves match.
Kind of thing ain't been done in a long time, though.
The bullet that was taken out of the Archbishop
was completely mangled on impact.
FBI match was metallurgical.
Thank you, Mother.
Yeah, but you couldn't guarantee that going in, so they had to be sure.
And I still can't figure out how they could be.
Good coffee? Yep.
Look on your left, there. Second shelf down.
Red leather spine.
Written by a guy named Schofeld.
Put it there 15 years ago. Don't figure it's moved since then.
Yeah. Paper patching.
State of the art. 1870s Africa.
Paper-wrapped bullet.
No metal on metal going down the barrel.
Grooves would match. Paper unwinds at the muzzle.
Leaves no traces when it hits.
Interesting question, though. Hope I satisfied you.
I got another one.
I thought you might.
Suppose I was looking for a man to make a 2,200-yard cold-bore shot.
Who's alive that could do that?
Seems I heard about a shot like that being made not too long ago.
Said the guy's name was Bob Lee Swagger.
Never met the man, so I wouldn't know him.
Yeah, they said that, all right.
They also said that artificial sweeteners were safe,
and WMDs were in Iraq,
and Anna Nicole married for love!
Would've been a bad job to take, though.
How come?
Whoever took that shot's probably dead now.
That's how a conspiracy works.
Them boys on the grassy knoll, they were dead within three hours.
Buried in the damn desert. Unmarked graves out past Terlingua.
And you know this for a fact?
Still got the shovel.
Sake of argument, somebody other than him?
There was a guy in Russia.
They locked his ass up.
Another one in France. I know he's dead.
There was one guy,
but he don't shoot no more.
A brutal son of a bitch.
Most boys shoot to kill. He'd shoot to wound,
wait till his friends come to help,
kill them too.
Turned one target into four.
Men, women, children. Killed them by the hundreds.
The other side wanted him. Bad.
Finally narrowed his hide down to an abandoned six-story building.
They quit the subtle tactics.
They called in an artillery strike.
Leveled a square block.
Brought the building down on his ass.
Some say he crawled out of there.
Some say he died.
Never heard from him no more.
Fuck me.
What?
I met the son of a bitch.
Yeah. The world ain't what it seems, is it, Gunny?
No, sir.
You keep that in mind.
The moment you think you got it figured,
you're wrong.
He got a name?
Hey, it's me, Nick.
Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?
Yeah. Are you okay? Nick, where are you?
It's better I don't tell you.
Look, do you have a pen?
I need you to find someone. Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.
-Yeah. -You got it?
I got it.
Man, this is hard to spell.
Swagger is going to go with what he knows.
He'll try to track the shooter.
He won't get far that way.
Yes, he will.
How's that? We're going to help him.
Sometimes to catch a wolf, you need to tie the bait to a tree.
And what happens to the bait?
Hard to say.
But that's the nature of being the bait.
Hey, it's Nick. Did you find him? He's in Virginia.
[Johnson] An end we thought was tied up
came untied.
Meaning, Colonel?
Swagger is still alive.
Oh, my.
I need to land a transport plane without a customs check.
I'm certain I don't want to know, but what's on the plane?
Crew we used in Ethiopia.
Twenty-four good, hard men.
Weapons and gear.
Only 24?
Do kill him.
No loose ends this time.
Night, Colonel.
Good night, Senator.
Hello?
Someone there?
Now look.
Look what you've done now.
Give me that.
I don't want you to hurt yourself. Okay?
Where's your boyfriend?
[Memphis] What if it's a trap?
[Swagger] Oh, it's a trap.
Guaranteed. Every time.
Question is, for whom?
-You got your list, right? -Yeah.
All right, you make sure you stick to it.
Let's go.
Okay, so what are these for again?
Tear gas is going to be on my remote.
Right.
Napalm on the first floor. Pipe bombs on the rest of them.
Gotta be very careful with these. It's got a 15-foot kill radius.
So what exactly are we getting ready for?
For as much as we can be.
All right, you got four enemy combatants.
Take them one by one.
Keep shooting. Don't let anything distract you.
Fuck!
Didn't I say don't let anything distract you?
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Let's see it.
No. No.
It's just you and me, baby.
No!
[Memphis] You got three guards.
One at your two o'clock,
twelve o'clock
and ten o'clock.
Danger close. Two o'clock, fifty yards.
[Memphis] You got one right on you.
Twenty yards and closing.
[Sandor] Go check the perimeter.
And tell the others to stay alert.
[guard] I'm on it. Right away, sir.
Swagger, you got one above you on the roof.
You killed all three?
There were four.
I want Johnson's real name. I want to know who he works for.
I want to know why it was worth going through that much effort
to kill the Archbishop.
Aren't you the one that shot him?
And if I don't know any of those things?
Then you're of no worth to me
and I might as well shoot you now and leave.
Johnson's had a lot of names.
Don't know one's any more real than the next.
Knowing would only be dangerous.
He's ex-army.
Pretty sure he was a full-bird colonel.
Go on.
They came for me, like they came for you.
Recruitment for a single job.
They like the wounded.
Easier to use
and then throw away when you are done.
Timmons, you, me…
Once you've been a wolf, it's hard to be staked down like a goat.
This is just one dead man talking to another.
And the Archbishop?
You want to take all suspicions away when you shoot someone,
wait till he's standing next to the President.
What was he going to say?
The truth.
That nothing, no matter how horrible,
ever really happens without the approval of the government.
Over there, and here.
The problem isn't the doing.
It's the people in power having to admit
that they knew.
The prisoners are tortured at Abu Ghraib,
and only the underlings go to jail.
Their bosses knew.
We know their bosses knew.
But you don't say it.
What exactly happened in Africa?
Somehow the villagers didn't think
that an oil pipeline
was a good enough reason to move their village
to a place where the spirit gods didn't exist.
Drink?
So they asked them all nicely to move
and when they didn't, they just killed them all?
No.
They didn't ask.
They just killed them.
All.
So the next village won't need to be asked.
They'll just go.
There is a mass grave with 400 bodies,
men, women, children,
under the oil-pumping station ten kilometers over the Eritrean border.
You should know.
You covered the retreat of the contractors who did the job.
Of course, you weren't supposed to survive that, either.
Who runs Johnson?
A senator. From Montana, I think.
You don't get it.
There is no head to cut off.
It's a conglomerate.
If one of them betrays the principles
of the accrual of money and power,
the others betray him.
What it is
is human weakness.
You can't kill that with a gun.
[whispering] Swagger. Swagger.
You got to get out of there. They're everywhere.
Had to keep you till they got here.
Lying wasn't going to hold you.
You would have known.
By the way, they've got your woman.
[Memphis] Swagger.
They're 20 yards and closing. You got to get out of there.
Bug out. Go to hide two. [Memphis] Roger that.
[panting] Swagger, I'm in position two.
You got to get out of there.
-They're all over the place. -Hey!
Calm down.
Blow the pipe bombs outside on my call, okay? You got it?
[whispering] Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got it.
Listen very carefully.
On my one, you blow the pipe bombs,
then the gas.
Three, two, one…
Hit it. Hit the napalm.
Swagger!
You got it.
[Memphis] Swagger!
Swagger!
Swagger!
You got to bug out on my go behind that barn.
Okay.
-You ready? -Yeah.
Go!
Come on!
You got to gun it to that tree line.
What?
You got five shots left. Gotta draw that bird out.
Okay. Okay.
On my cover, all right? Okay.
All right, go!
[man] Pull up! Pull up!
Time to go!
[woman] Let me take a look.
[Purnell] Not right now.
Morning, beautiful.
See this shootout in Virginia?
Shells everywhere, helicopter remnants, blood. No bodies, though, right?
And they get fingerprints off the cartridge cases.
First set positively ID'd as Bob Lee Swagger.
Second set belongs to Special Agent Nick Memphis
of the FBI.
What? That's gotta be wrong.
Now, the only reasonable question to ask after that is, uh,
what the fuck is going on?
Great shot!
-[man] All yours, Dan! -[man 1] Good shooting!
I'm beginning to think that you were the wrong man for the job.
Think what you want.
It appears we misjudged the gunnery sergeant.
There's always a confused soul
that thinks that one man can make a difference.
And you have to kill him to convince him otherwise.
That's the hassle with democracy.
[man] Pull!
[Purnell] …fire under their asses, you understand me?
We need those results now.
Anna, you guys, you take the team… Anna! To the roadhouse.
Okay, I don't care who it is right now. I don't give…
Guys! We got Memphis on the line.
Start a trace.
Got it. I'm on it.
Nick. Hey, it's Howard here. How are you?
Things have gotten a little complicated. I got Bob Lee Swagger in custody.
Yeah, turns out he's not dead, Howard.
Yeah, I know. Word of that possibility had begun to reach us.
Got him.
Were you in a gunfight in Virginia last night?
Like I said, things have gotten a little complicated.
Well, obviously the best thing for you would be to bring him in, right?
I know, I can't do that.
Why?
It's gotten too deep. It's not clear who can be trusted.
But we're the FBI, son. Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I'll keep in touch.
Oh, Nick, wait…
Son of a bitch.
-Did we get that? -Got him.
-Let's move. -They're on an interstate
-outside Bozeman, Montana. -Let's move!
This is Swagger.
Colonel Johnson here. Figured you'd be listening.
It appears you have nowhere to go. [Swagger] Colonel?
If it is "Colonel"?
It is.
I have something you want. Well, it seems so do I.
[beeps] [Sandor] Over the Eritrean border, there is a mass grave with 400 bodies.
Men, women, children.
Tell you what, I'll give it to you and we'll call it even.
I just want someone there I can trust.
I'm amenable. Who do you have in mind?
How about that guy from U2 with the glasses?
Friend of Nelson Mandela and all. He seems trustworthy.
Bono? You want them to get Bono?
My colleague's questioning my choice. Okay,
I see how that could be a tough problem. You know, last minute and all.
How about six-term senator Charles Meachum
from Montana?
Seems like a pretty good second choice, don't you think?
I don't think so.
I'm gonna provide you with two numbers, then we'll talk.
Point 732. Point 648.
And what the hell is that?
Those are the last three digits, down to a few meters of latitude and longitude,
of an oil pipeline pumping station in Eritrea
with 400 bodies underneath.
Where are we meeting?
Somewhere I can see you,
coming from a goddamn long way off.
Where's your boy?
Well, I'm here.
He's here.
Look, look, look.
There's your boy. There's your boy, baby.
Come on, come on. Look, look. Look up.
Okay.
I think I broke a rib!
Don't move!
Is there anybody else?
No.
He head-shoots me, spasm kills her!
You got no shot!
No shot, Swagger! You hear that, Swagger?
You got no shot!
What are you gonna do? Come on!
[Payne] It's over for you, buddy!
No shot! Okay, fuck him.
Not bad!
Pretty good! He went for the shot.
Christ.
[Turner] How can we help you?
Guest at the motel last night gave me $100
to bring this by here at 3:00 p.m.
Let's move!
You all right?
Yeah.
Search him.
[Meachum] I don't carry a weapon,
ordinarily.
[Meachum] I'm licensed to carry that in this state.
Pull the pilot.
[Memphis] Put your weapon down! Put it down!
Put your gun down!
Easy. Easy.
Sarah.
Give me the gun.
It's okay. Give me the gun.
You okay?
[Memphis] Put them up. Keep them up.
Nice shooting, Gunny.
Yeah, you got what you came for.
I think it's time you owe us your side of the bargain.
You do, huh?
Yes, I do, son. I certainly do.
Why don't we think about all this that has gone on
just as a preamble?
You got any plans after this?
You have a rather unique skill set. I'd be interested in offering you a job.
Work? For you?
It's not really as bad as it seems. It's all gonna be done in any case.
You might as well be on the side that gets you well-paid for your efforts.
And what side are you on?
There are no sides. There's no Sunnis and Shiites.
There's no Democrats and Republicans.
There's only haves and have-nots.
What exactly does working for you entail, Senator, huh?
Raping and murdering innocent women and children, you sick fuck?
You sanctioned the mass murder of an entire village
so a pipeline could go through.
One village!
And it brought stability to the region.
Which means that no one chops off their arms
because their grandmother's grandfather
belonged to a different tribe.
They like us down there, boy.
This is a country
where the Secretary of Defense
can go on TV
and tell the American public,
oh, that, "This is about freedom! It's not about oil!"
And nobody questions him,
because they don't want to hear the answer
because it's a lie!
There's only so many places at the table, Gunny.
Now are you on the inside,
or are you on the out?
It's the FBI!
It's gonna be okay. Hold this.
[Sandor] If one of them betrays the principles of the accrual…
I don't think so, Senator.
What are you doing? Saving our lives.
That proved you were innocent! Nobody out here is innocent!
This stuff's plutonium. Nobody can handle it without dying.
You hand it over to the authorities, it's just gonna disappear, along with us!
Unless you want to get buried in the hills outside Terlingua.
I'm out, old man!
I'm just a peckerwood who lives in the hills with too many guns.
You happy?
Where do you think you're going?
Washington!
You going to shoot a sitting U.S. senator in the back?
Lord knows I want to.
I didn't think so.
[Swagger] Let him go.
They've got your rifle.
From the beginning, they've always had your rifle.
Recovered at the site.
You can talk as much as you want, but in the end,
you're going to die by lethal injection,
and I'm going to go back to what I was doing.
I won.
You lost.
Get used to the idea, son.
I'm not your son.
[agent 1] Drop your weapons! Put it down now! [agent 2] Don't move!
Special Agent Nick Memphis, FBI! Don't shoot!
-[agent 2] On the ground! -[agent 1] Down, now!
I said get down!
Could I free my hands, please? It's okay.
Thank you, sir.
-Thanks for bringing her. -Mmm-hmm.
Hey. I'm sorry about everything.
It's not your fault. It is what it is.
This is Attorney General Russert.
Director Brandt. Sir.
Senator Meachum couldn't be with us today.
I'm sure we can manage without him.
Sergeant Swagger, you asked for this meeting.
Against my better judgment, I've agreed to it as a favor to the FBI.
What the hell am I doing here?
You've got nothing on me. I'm covered.
Call the Joint Chief.
That won't be necessary, Colonel,
as I have already received no less than a dozen calls
from highly-ranked and powerfully-placed individuals
telling me to let you go.
But the joy of checks and balances in our government is that I can,
and am, indeed, required by law,
to tell them to fuck off.
This is about evidence and finding out the truth,
so you sit there and be quiet.
Sergeant, you've got five minutes.
Thank you.
This is my weapon.
No question about it, don't deny it.
You recovered it at the scene moments after the assassination.
We agree?
It's been in the FBI's possession ever since,
hasn't been tampered with in any way?
No. Absolutely not.
You fire the weapon? There was no point.
The slug was mangled beyond recognition.
It was, however, an exact metallurgical match.
Right. Definitely my bullets.
Definitely my gun.
Special Agent Memphis, you believe I shot that Archbishop?
Nope. No, I don't.
Have any proof of this fact? No.
-Trust me? -Yep.
Really trust me?
Yeah.
With your life?
Yep. Good.
What the hell are you doing? Put that weapon down now!
If you're zeroed for 600, you ought to aim a little lower.
Ain't gonna make a difference this close.
Only thing that's gonna make a difference
is whether I'm crazy or not.
I could keep doing this all day,
with every weapon in my house.
I swapped all the firing pins before I left the house. I always do.
Looks right, need a micrometer to tell.
But the gun don't shoot.
That bullet you got out of that bishop was fired from my weapon,
but a week before, at a can of stew.
I did take an oath to defend this country from all enemies, foreign and domestic.
I just didn't figure I'd end up quite this involved.
But at the end of the day, when all the dust settles,
you can't hide from the truth, you son of a bitch.
Whatever.
Who gives a shit?
Nice presentation.
But none of it sticks to me.
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.
Done.
I'll be seeing you.
He's right. There's nothing to prove he did anything.
Yeah, in this country.
Sir, you should take a look at these.
These images are from a classified file showing a village of people in Africa
that were exterminated by the colonel and his associates.
[Russert] My God.
Look around you.
This isn't the Horn of Africa.
That's all hearsay.
This is the land of the free and the home of the brave.
And I'm free to go.
[Russert] Colonel, your moral compass is so fucked up,
I'll be shocked if you manage to find your way back to the parking lot.
Regardless of how I feel about this,
these events occurred in another country,
outside of our laws.
So that's it? That's the best you can do?
This isn't the World Court, Sergeant.
And I don't have the jurisdiction to detain the colonel
for crimes he may or may not have committed on another continent.
Sir, I urge you to reconsider-- There's nothing to reconsider, son.
I win.
You lose.
Again.
This is ridiculous.
For the record, I don't like the way this turned out any more than you do.
But this is the world we live in.
And justice does not always prevail.
It's not the Wild West,
where you can clean up the streets with a gun.
Even though sometimes that's exactly what's needed.
Bob Lee Swagger, you're free to go.
Unshackle the sergeant.
[Johnson] I'd say that's quite a shot, Senator.
[Meachum] In the face.
You heard that expression,
"You didn't know whether to shit or go blind"?
You should've seen the look on the Attorney General's face.
Did he give his checks-and-balances speech?
"This is about evidence and the truth!"
And then you just said to him,
"Fuck you!"
"Hold my cigar, Mr. A.G."
"Fuck you!
"The truth is what I say it is!"
You know, you got to be out of the country in the morning.
You're going to Ecuador.
Well, we're having some problems with the locals.
We have our personnel on the ground ready to neutralize the problem, but…
Well, they've requested you.
It's solvable.
They requested you--
Swagger.
Turn off the lights!
Get my car.
Get my car.
[whispers] Do something.
Do something!
Where is he?
He's under the floor! [gunshot]
You don't need to kill me.
You don't need to kill me. It was them.
It was them.
God damn it! Just wait a minute!
Hold it just a minute. Hold it.
Are you out of your mind? Are you out of your damn mind?
four brothers…
genetically reborn  in the sewers of New York.
Named after the great  Renaissance masters…
and trained as ninjas.
They battled  many creatures and foes
before defeating  their arch-enemy,  the Shredder.
But now,  a greater evil is poised  to destroy  their very brotherhood.
An evil born 3,000 years ago.
It was in that time that a warrior king named Yoatl
It was in that time that a warrior king named Yoatl  led a brotherhood that fought side by side with one purpose.
led a brotherhood that fought side by side with one purpose.
To conquer all the kingdoms  of the world.
Nothing could  stand in their way,
as they left a trail of  destruction behind them.
In his quest, the warrior  learned of a constellation
known as the Stars of Kicaan.
Every 3,000 years,  the stars would align…
opening a portal  to a world of unknown power.
He became immortal,  but at a price.
His brotherhood  was turned to stone.
And upon the portal's opening,
13 monsters were released  into our world.
The warrior king was left to eternally walk the Earth…
unable to die or forget his horrible mistake.
And the monsters  that were unleashed
continue to plague mankind  to this very day.
-[woman] Monsters. -[man chuckles]
No.
We appreciate the generous donation
for the continued protection of your village.
After all, the jungle can be a very dangerous place.
-Mama! -[man] Oh, she is dangerous.
There's monsters out there.
[curses in Spanish] Watch where you're going.
There's a log on the road, senor.
Well, if you're not too busy, remove it!
Cortez, andale.
Dios mio.
Who are you? Show yourself.
[driver] The Ghost of the Jungle.
He punishes those who prey upon the weak.
He's coming.
I just remembered I left the stove on. My wife, she hates that!
-Coward. Get back here. -You're on your own, jefe.
Show yourself. Do you realize who you're dealing with?
What is this? What?
I am not afraid of a myth.
I'm not afraid of a ghost.
What are you?
[gasps] It's a miracle.
The Ghost of the Jungle.
There. That's where I saw him.
Thank you.
You'd better get home now.
Do you know the ghost?
He wasn't always a ghost.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Hello?
[Leonardo] It's a long way from the city to just drop in.
Leo.
You came all the way down here to look for me?
Actually, I was already here on business.
But then the local legend started sounding familiar,
so I decided to snoop around.
What kind of business?
Ancient artifacts.
Some tycoon with too much time on his hands
has his heart set on a collection of 3000-year-old statues.
Well, you always did run with a strange crowd, April.
Yeah, well. Our strange crowd
hasn't been the same without you.
Things aren't looking so good back home.
[sighs] How bad could it be?
Donnie's probably got everything under control.
-Sir? Sir. Sir. -[man chattering]
Did you turn the computer on? Have you plugged it in?
Yeah, that would help.
No, I'm not playing hard to get.
I'm telling you, sir, it's not that kind of phone line.
I'm not your enemy. I'm just Donnie,
your friendly IT tech support, here to help you 24 hours a day, sir.
Yeah, I'm sorry. Ma'am. [chuckles nervously]
But Donnie's a genius.
Why would he take a job like that?
At least he's keeping busy.
Well, if he's doing that, who's keeping an eye on Mikey?
[April] Mike's gotten into the,  um, entertainment business.
Yeah. Happy birthday from Cowabunga Carl.
Take it easy, little dudes. I bruise easily.
Hey, black-and-blue clashes with green, dudes. Hey, that's… [groans]
He's a big hit.
All right. Let's hear it. What's Raph doing?
No one really knows. He just sleeps all day.
Well, what's he do all night?
POLICE[man] 2802, 2802, burglary in progress at 55th and Broadway.
Suspects considered  armed and dangerous.
[Raphael] Time to punch in.
Good work, boys. That was easier than I thought it was gonna be.
Hey, look, guys. I grabbed a toaster.
I love your work ethic, Tommy. It's an inspiration to us all.
-What was that? -Huh?
What's going on, guys?
What in the… Ow!
Looks like it's just you and me, shaky.
Take it easy. I'm not gonna hurt you…
much.
I love when they play hard to get.
The Nightwatcher.
-He's doing our job for us again. -Tommy…
-Keep your hands to yourself. -Hey, who's tickling me?
Your training period ended a year ago.
And Splinter says you don't write anymore.
Splinter sent me down here to become a better leader.
I can't go back a failure.
Besides, these people need me more than my brothers do.
If Master Splinter were here, he would ask you, "What is your heart telling you?"
he would ask you, "What is your heart telling you?"
I don't know. I just know something's missing.
Your brothers need you, Leo.
They're lost without you.
Leo?
Why skate a halfpipe when you can skate a sewer pipe?
Sewer's up, brah.
Ho-ho! Cowabunga!
[distorted] Dude. [normal voice] Going down.
Here's Mikey. -[chuckles nervously] -[video games sounds]
Guys? Anyone?
Hello?
[sighs] Whatever.
This place used to be fun.
[newscaster] And with  rocketing interest rates,
that's bad news for homeowners  as the real-estate market continues its downward spiral.
as the real-estate market continues its downward spiral.
Coming up, the vigilante known as Nightwatcher strikes again.
[man] Now, I can't say for sure, but he was definitely an alien.
[woman] I think it's a disgrace, taking the law into your own hands like that.
-Leave it to the police. -[newscaster] Up next…
I remember how that used to feel,
busting up crime syndicates.
Sure, they had a bunch of guns,
but they weren't like these guns. [grunts]
Why do you do this to yourself, Mikey?
Those glory days are over.
Forget about 'em. Get on with your life.
Concentrate on your work.
Yeah, yeah. Spoken like a true has-been.
Well, look who woke up.
I suppose you think the Nightwatcher is some kind of hero.
Beats sitting around doing nothing while dirtbags run free.
I would love to know what it is that you do that's so great.
At least we're contributing around here. All you do is sleep all day.
Yeah, I do nothing. You're right.
You got me all figured out.
I know that your attitude has always been
a source of contention to this team. You think fear is the best way to accomplish things, but you're wrong.
You think fear is the best way to accomplish things, but you're wrong.
First of all, this team you speak of doesn't exist anymore.
And second of all… [grunts]
[Splinter] Raphael.
Enough.
[chuckles] I think I made my point.
That doesn't prove anything.
Why couldn't you send him away for training?
Donatello, this home has become like an empty shell.
Each of your brothers has strengths and weaknesses.
You must learn to be strong when they are weak.
If you don't learn to recognize this,
then all hope is lost for our family.
[man] Keep it coming.
[April] Hey, careful.
Those aren't souvenirs.
[man] Ah. Sorry about that, ma'am.
Where are you, Casey?
-[cell phone ringing] -Come on. Come on, pick up.
Don't do this to me again. Not now.
Casey can't come  to the phone right now
'cause we're hardly working.
[groans] This better be good.
[April] Casey,  I am standing on the dock
with a priceless statue  and no delivery truck.
-So my question is, where are you? -April.
Hey, babe. I am so sorry.  I set the alarm clock, but…
It's broken. The clock…
It's bad enough that you're out every night playing vigilante,
but we've got a deadline to meet.
[sighs] I'm sorry.
Oh, wait, babe, real quick.
You left a message saying you found Leo.
-I mean, is he there with you?  -No.
I found him. He's not coming back.
But… But didn't you tell him how weird things have gotten with the Turtles?
Look, Casey, we're gonna lose  the biggest client we have
if you don't get down here.
All right. I'm on my way.
Please tell me we're getting paid by the pound here.
Is this place a museum or what?
You've never heard of WintersCorp?
That's what I'm telling you.
They're into everything, real estate,
technology, pharmaceuticals, hair gel.
-[Casey] I don't wear hair gel. -[April] Really?
[Casey] I'm the caveman type,  au naturel.
Just make sure you don't touch anything in here.
Hey, I was born careful.
-Hope that wasn't expensive. -[alarm blaring]
Oh, wait… Just… I'm…
-Oh, boy. -Please tell me that wasn't you.
-[April] Mr. Winters. -Miss O'Neil.
All the pieces are coming together.
Oh, my. This is my associate, Casey.
-Nice to meet you, Kenny. -Boyfriend. It's Casey.
So you were successful?
Yes. The fourth general.
I want to ask you before I go,
if I could take one last look?
I believe this is the one they call General Akeela?
[Winters] It's actually "Aguila," but that was a good try.
These statues may appear to be only stone,
but they're like family to me.
I didn't choose them.
Friends you can choose, but never your family.
Okay, then.
Take care, Mr. Winters.
If you've come to kill me, could you make it fast?
I've got a shareholders' meeting at 10:00.
I'd rather miss it.
If we had come here to hurt you, you'd be hurting already.
The Foot Clan and I have come to hear your offer.
Well, it appears that today is my lucky day.
I must warn you, we do not come cheap.
Does it look like money is of any concern to me?
Only time is of the essence, my dear.
Since you're so rich and powerful,
what is it we could possibly have to offer you?
I need you to be my eyes and ears.
I have some friends coming to town
that I'd like to roll out the red carpet for.
Greet them warmly and bring them to me.
And how will we know these friends?
[Winters] Don't worry, they're impossible to miss.
And you keep them up. Got that?
And don't let me catch you calling the cops.
[gasps] What? Not again.
Didn't I take care of you last week?
Hey. Oh, no. Come on, now. Wait.
I'm very disappointed in you, knucklehead.
-Guess night school's in session. -[Casey whistles]
Hope I'm not disturbing class.
Hey, Nightwatcher, need any teaching assistants?
[Nightwatcher] [softly] Oh, no. Casey.
[clears throat] I got this one covered, pal. Thanks, but no, thanks.
You think you own these rooftops?
I happen to think you could use my help.
And I could use a sidekick.
You may have everyone else fooled, but you haven't fooled me, Raph.
Yeah, well, guess what, pal. Now you…
Hey, wait a minute. How did you know it was me?
Wasn't that hard, man. You know, you look like a big, metal turtle.
[groans] It's that obvious, huh?
[man panting] I should've stayed in law school.
[Casey] Oh, ain't that cute? He's trying to get away.
[Casey] Well, looks like I got a sidekick.
[Nightwatcher] Yeah, right. You're the sidekick.
[man] What, is it performance art? I don't get it.
[Raphael] What was I supposed to do? Sit around, wait for Leo to come back and save the day?
Sit around, wait for Leo to come back and save the day?
I mean, we haven't heard one word from him
since Splinter sent him away on his little vacation.
Come on, you think these lowlifes take vacations at the first sign of pressure?
No. The criminal element of this city may be guilty of a lot of things
but being quitters ain't one of them.
You know, I don't even care about Leo anymore.
Kind of hope he never comes back.
Come on, aren't you being a little hard on the guy?
I don't know. It's possible.
I guess if I could live anywhere other than the city, I'd go too.
But I could never leave this place.
I can't even sleep without the sound of the subway rumbling over my head.
I guess it comes from growing up with a houseful of brothers.
I'm not trying to tell you what to do.
I'm just saying that if it was my brother, I'd find a way to work it out.
But that's just me.
I got my own issues, you know? Like back at home, with April.
There's this whole thing about settling down
that makes me miss the old times.
I don't know if I can be the grownup she needs me to be.
[sighs] Good talk, Raph.
[Winters] Arise, my brothers. Arise, dear sister.
The Stars of Kicaan align.
All ye generals, wake from your stone slumber.
Dude…
[snoring] Dude.
Enter.
Kneel, my son.
I return from my training, master.
I was so caught up in my own world, I forgot about everyone else.
I'm sorry I failed.
[Splinter] On the contrary, my son…
now you are much stronger.
Your strength is needed here now.
You owe me no apology, but perhaps you should talk to Raphael.
Your absence has been particularly difficult for him…
though he'll never admit it.
I'm certain things will be back to normal in no time, master.
Good. Because until you can act as one,
you are forbidden to fight.
Yes, Sensei.
I have missed you, Leonardo.
I've missed you too, Father.
Raphael… Your brother is home.
-Hey. -Hey.
Welcome home.
Yeah. Thanks.
Well, [yawns] I'm going to bed.
[Raphael] Hey, Leo's back. Better go say hello before he leaves again.
-What? Leo! -Hey. [chuckles]
-Hey. -[Michelangelo] Huh, Leo?
-Is that really you? -Yeah.
-I'm, like, dreaming, aren't I? -No, Mikey, you're not dreaming.
Oh, good. I have nightmares about birthday parties.
[Raphael] Okay, Leo, I'll bite. What are we doing up here?
I told Splinter I'd get this team in shape again.
Hey, I've been training. Since you left, my video-game scores have, like, doubled.
Right, and while you've been playing games, little brother…
this Nightwatcher character's come into the neighborhood
this Nightwatcher character's come into the neighborhood like some kind of vigilante showboat. But his days are done.
like some kind of vigilante showboat. But his days are done.
Hey, you went AWOL, Leo…
and the Nightwatcher was the only guy to pick up the slack.
Crime never took a break. You did.
I heard his bike turns into a plane, or, like, a jetpack.
Hey, Don, you're so smart, why don't we have jetpacks?
Yeah. That's good, Mikey. I don't even trust you with a driver's license.
-Have you seen the way this guy behaves… -[loud roaring]
Oh-ho! Someone's cranky.
-Okay, jungle boy. Grab a vine. -Raph, wait.
-Okay, jungle boy. Grab a vine. -Raph, wait. Splinter told us not to fight.
[Michelangelo chuckling] "Jungle boy." Good one.
[Leonardo] All right. But remember, we're only up here for training.
[Michelangelo] You know what I always say, "Train by doing, dude. "
[Leonardo] Mikey, when have you ever said that?
Oof… You smell that? It's like a monkey cage up here.
Wow, good news is, there's a bunch of Foot ninjas
getting the snot kicked out of them.
Bad news is, this thing is gonna run out of bodies soon.
Yeah, so? You think we should help these guys?
I'd rather enjoy the show. What do you say, fearless leader?
-We're not… -I say we stop talking.
Yahoo!
[Michelangelo] Come here, fuzzy wuzzy.
[Karai] You.
I think we're getting off on the wrong foot here.
-We're trying to help you. -[Karai] Never.
Team… [speaking Japanese]
[Leonardo] Wait, the Shredder's dead.
Who are you working for?
[Raphael] Hey, a little help, O fearless one.
That was too easy.
Like I said, too easy.
Bad dog.
[Donatello grunts] Look at me. Found the elevator.
[Michelangelo] Oh, my shoulder.
[Donatello] My spleen!
[Raphael] This place needed a skylight.
[Michelangelo] This is why we need jetpacks.
-[Donatello] Okay, any more bright ideas? -[Michelangelo] How about this?
[Michelangelo] When this is over, I'm totally calling the architect.
[Donatello] Wait a minute. How did something that big just disappear?
-[sirens wailing] -It doesn't… Uh-oh…
[Michelangelo] Dude, it's the cops.
[Leonardo] Raph. Raph!
I give us a ten for style, an eight for skill,
and a two for stealth.
What seems to be the problem?
The problem is that we were hired to merely patrol the city
and report anything strange to you.
You never said anything about monsters.
Now, I'm sorry that your illustrious group have been reduced to hired guns,
but I believe we made a deal, Karai.
And I expect you to honor it.
You do understand honor, don't you?
So how did we fare?
My, my, my. And what is your name?
Were there any problems, general?
[Aguila] None, my lord.
Then show these fools how a true warrior acts.
Keep them on schedule in completing their task.
[Karai] We do not need any help.
[Winters] Nevertheless, Karai, I trust my family more than I trust you.
You may be the eyes and ears, but they are the muscle.
They will help you gather the remaining twelve of these abominations
so we can finally see our birthrights fulfilled.
[snickers] It's going to be quite a party.
Dudes, did anyone get the license plate of that thing that hit us last night?
Ow, my head.
[Donatello] Okay, that was just weird. I mean, first the Foot,
[Donatello] Okay, that was just weird. I mean, first the Foot, then that hideous monster.
Yeah. It looked like your mom, dude. [laughs]
Yeah, that would make her your mom too, doofus.
Yeah, whatever.
Keep laughing, Mikey. Last night was an embarrassment.
I'll tell you what's embarrassing.
You can't even follow a single order.
Oh, how cute. You've been back for five minutes
and now you're schooling us on your master plan?
Okay, so this is my fault now, huh, Raph?
I'm the only one that has to be responsible?
Hey, you're the trained master, not me.
-Dudes, can it. Here comes Splinter. -[stick tapping]
Oh… Good morning, my sons.
MICHELANGELO, [Donatello] Good morning, Sensei. [Raphael] Sup?
[Splinter] Every ninja's day should start with a healthy breakfast.
It fills me with pride to see you boys together again.
If anyone needs me, I'll be watching my stories.
-[Leonardo] Hothead. -[Raphael] Splinter, Jr.
Cody is going to break up with Donna. I just know it.
[newscaster] We interrupt the Gilmore Girls for this special news report.
Monsters loose in the city?
Strange reports are coming in about a construction site incident
that sounds like something  out of science fiction.
Boys!
[Splinter] Leonardo, I am most disappointed in you.
You are the eldest of your brothers.
I was counting on you to bring order to the chaos of this family.
This is why I have forbidden any surface activity.
We cannot return to the surface to fight evil
if we continue to fight each other.
But, Master Splinter, how can I be expected to do so…
There are no excuses when you are the leader, my student.
We have to go out and find who's responsible for this.
There ain't no other solution.
Save the brute-vigilante junk for that Nightwatchman.
-Nightwatcher. -[Michelangelo] Nightwatch-er. Yeah, whatever.
I'm going out.
[newscaster] Witnesses say  there are holes in the floors
as if something or someone had just blasted straight down through them
leaving authorities  scratching their heads.
leaving authorities  scratching their heads. [sighs] Well, at least some people care about justice these days.
[sighs] Well, at least some people care about justice these days.
[Raphael whispering] Hey, Casey.
-Raph? -Meet me on the roof, okay?
What is it?
The roof. You know what the roof is, don't you?
Pushy sidekick.
[newscaster] We've gotten this image in from an amateur cameraman
and I do stress "amateur."
Casey, come look at this.
Be safe.
What's this all about, Raph?
We got bigger things to worry about than I think criminals.
Like what?
-[Casey] Whoa! -[Raphael] Come on.
[Casey] I think we lost it.
It's gotta be around here somewhere.
[Casey] I don't think so.
What's going on, Raph?
Did I mention we ran into a monster last night?
No, you kind of failed to tell me about that one, buddy.
[Casey] You do know I only have a wooden bat, don't you?
The Foot? I thought they were history.
And now we got walking statues? You got a plan for those?
Yeah. Hey, Those are a first for me too.
And who knows? These guys might be friendly.
Friendly.
Wait a second. Those statues look… Oop…
[Gato] Witnesses.
[Raphael] Watch out.
I don't feel so good.
[Raphael] That can't be good.
[Casey coughs] That's just rude.
[gasps] Hey, wait up.
-Raph? -Come here.
-[Raphael] What, you never heard of smoke pellets? -Warn me next time.
[coughs] I got allergies.
[Casey] Come on. That's the second mask this week.
[Raphael] They'll never find us in here.
Stay with me, now. We'll be out of here soon.
And I thought Girl Scouts were pushy.
Some people just can't take a hint.
[officer] This is the police.  You on the roof,
put your hands behind your…
What is that?  Tommy, you see this?
Yeah, you better run.
I gotta hand it to you, Raph.
You sure know how to show a lady a good time.
Raph?
Oh, no. I gotta get you someplace safe, pal.
My compliments to the chef.
[chuckles] Anyone for dessert?
-No! -Yes.
Cowabunga Carl Party Services.
Cowabunga, dude. [April] Raph's hurt. You need to get over here right away.
[April] Raph's hurt. You need to get over here right away. Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, April.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, April.
What happened to Raph? I don't know. He's unconscious.
I don't know. He's unconscious. [sighs] We'll be right there.
Leo! You came back.
Leo!
Sorry the reunion isn't under better circumstances. [chuckles] Whoa.
Nice pad, kids.
Oh, hey, Raph.
Well, his vital signs seem to be okay.
Pupil dilation is normal.
Some sort of stone.
Probably obsidian, I think.
Well, is he gonna be all right?
You're still here? Go back to your jungle.
Well, at least his personality's still intact.
And there's an engraving on it. Looks South American.
That's your department, April.
Would it help things if I told you
that those statues you collected for that Winters guy
were shooting these things at me and Raph?
"The Legend of Yaotl."
It can't be.
It was just a myth.
A scary story the locals told kids around a campfire.
Whoa, what are you talking about?
They say 3,000 years ago,
some great warrior actually found a portal to another dimension.
And when the portal opened,
the energy from it gave the warrior eternal life.
But it also turned  his generals to stone.
What if this warrior  just kept living forever?
He would spend the rest  of his days in regret,
spending all of his riches  and all of his power
to find a way to revive  his stone generals.
Maybe, just maybe,  he's built a new empire.
But, hey, like I said, it's just a myth.
Hmm, if you ask me, guys, this has Winters' name
Hmm, if you ask me, guys, this has Winters' name written all over it.
How do you figure that, Donnie?
[both] Yeah.
Because this has Winters' name written all over it.
Now I know who to thank for this shot in the arm.
So where do we find this guy and his stone jokers?
We're not going anywhere until we get Splinter's blessing.
You're going to stand here and quote a rulebook to me
that you ain't been following for a year?
Look, Raph, if you got something you wanna get off your shell, now's the time.
But I'm not gonna stand here and debate Splinter's direct orders with you.
Fine, then. I quit.
Hey, Raph. Don't do it, man.
Sometimes, just taking a breather is the best thing to do.
[sighs] Whatever.
To picking up the pieces.
What is it?
Two creatures remain, my lord.
Well, by all means, then, let's finish it.
And you will finally be free of your stone prison.
But if the curse is broken, we will no longer be immortal.
Brother, do not question my command.
-[rock and roll music playing] -Yeah! Here we go, now.
[April] So what are we looking for?
Well, according to these star charts,
the portal is set to open directly over Winters Tower
in the next 24 hours.
[April] So the legend is right. 3,000 years.
And when the portal opens,
we'll lose the city to monsters within hours.
Within days, the country.
And within weeks, the world.
Oh, so it's like Halley's Comet, only monsters come out?
Um… Yes, I… I guess so.
[chuckles] I'm smart.
I'm okay.
Why do we need Raph anyway?
It's his temper that always jeopardizes all our missions.
Okay, Leo. Whatever you say. Nobody was talking about him.
Leonardo, this team you are so eager to lead is incomplete.
You know what you must do.
Yes, Sensei.
[Aguila] Generals, I think our brother has plans to betray us.
The 13th monster must not be found.
[newscaster] Why don't we take one more call about these monster sightings?
Suffern, New Jersey, you're on.
Monster sightings. [scoffs]
[Dispatcher] Attention,  all on-duty officers.
Report of a disturbance  on 32nd.
No units available.
They're playing my song.
Where… Where are the cops? How come the cops haven't shown up?
Just remember what my analyst said, just go to my happy place.
Just go to my happy place it's gonna be fine. Happy place. I'm feeling good. I'm thin.
Happy place. I'm feeling good. I'm thin. -Don't get up. -[continues indistinctly]
-Don't get up. -[continues indistinctly] I'll serve myself.
Oh, look at you. Ain't you cute?
You want a butt-kicking, little fella?
[baby-talk] Yes, you do. You do.
Come on, I'm gonna drop-kick you to hurty town.
Come on, little guy.
Get off of me, you little monster!
-You're scratching the helmet. -[cackling]
Okay, that was different.
Hey, this thing ain't rustproof! Get off of me!
Come on.
How about a snack, little fella?
Catch!
Keep on running, you filthy little hermit crab.
That spicy meatball's on the house.
[exclaims] Big guy, please don't hurt me.
What? I'm not robbing you, I'm helping you.
Okay, whatever you say, sir. Please, I got kids in college.
Community college.
[grunts] Here you go, pal. -Make sure this is safe. -Take everything.
-Make sure this is safe. -Take everything. I'm not even looking. Go.
[Nightwatcher] Why is it everyone's got such a hard time -believing I am a good guy? -[man] Don't worry about it.
[Nightwatcher] I just saved your life.
[sighs] This night just keeps getting better and better.
I want you to know that I appreciate your intentions,
but you can't change the world like this.
-[muffled] The road you're on is a dead end. -[Nightwatcher] Is he kidding? -I've tried it. -He's lecturing.
[aloud] So I'm gonna give you one chance to just walk away and stop this vigilante nonsense.
to just walk away and stop this vigilante nonsense.
Okay, Leo, time to teach you a lesson.
Look, trust me when I tell you, you don't want to do this.
[chuckles] Oh, yeah. Well, I noticed you got quite a temper.
Hey, have you ever done this before?
Oh, come on! You call that an attack?
All right, finally, some excitement.
Funny thing about anger…
Let it consume you, and soon enough…
…you lose sight of everything.
Good night, Dark Prince.
Raph?
What?
You are so smug, you know that?
You think the world revolves around you, don't you?
That we couldn't possibly survive
without the mighty and powerful Leonardo
to guide us through our problems, huh?
Well, I got a news flash for you.
We got along just fine without you.
Oh, and this qualifies as "just fine"?
Dressing up like it's Halloween every night?
Risking the safety of our family?
I mean, come on. What were you thinking?
Don't push it, Leo.
You can't leave home and come back expecting us to fall in line again
like your little soldiers.
Hey, I was training,
training to be a better leader for you.
Why do you hate me for that? And whoever said I wanted to be led?
I'm better off calling my own shots.
Now get used to it!
You aren't ready!
You're impatient and hot-tempered.
And more importantly, I'm better than you.
Oh, you know something, big brother?
I have to disagree with you on that one.
Don't do this, Raph.
I'm done taking orders.
Not human, but clearly not the final monster.
Yaotl won't know the difference.
By the time our brother discovers this turtle is not the 13th monster,
it will already be too late.
Leo.
[shouts] Leo! Hang on!
Leo!
Leo!
[shouting] No!
-[grunts] -Raphael! What is the matter?
I was out. I was out and I did something.
Something happened and… And then, I… Then, I…
Raphael. Kneel.
I did something.
I did something really stupid, Master Splinter.
Go on.
I know why you chose him now.
I know that there's a reason why he's the better son, and I'm not.
Rafael. You always bear the world's problems on your shoulders.
It is an admirable quality when you are a protector of others.
But you must realize that while at times
you may not be my favorite student,
it does not mean that you are my least favorite son.
You are strong, passionate and loyal to a fault.
These are the merits of a great leader as well,
but only when tempered with compassion and humility.
But Master Splinter, I messed up big tonight.
I mean big.
They took him.
Leonardo.
Yeah.
Then the time for hiding is over.
We must return to the surface to take back what is ours.
By your wish, Father.
Long have we been in hiding.
Perhaps too long.
Well, what do we do now?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We're gonna rescue our brother,
and then we're gonna save New York City.
I got it on my last trip to Japan. -You like it? -Oh, yeah.
-You like it? -Oh, yeah.
No way.  ♪ But they sure love to stare ♪
You can't go trick-or-treating without your mask.
Oh, babe. Thanks.  ♪ I may be ugly… ♪
As ordered, no one gets into the tower.
No one interferes. No one bears witness.
You've got to be kidding me.
[Casey] Uh, [laughs sheepishly] Cowabunga, dude!
Uh, I'm here for little Maxie's 13th birthday party?
[Karai] Leave. Now.
[Casey] Oh, you don't understand, lady. I got…
[Winters] At last, after 3,000 years,
the time is finally at hand.
What? What have you done?
Your time for giving orders is over.
[Winters] You don't understand.
I want to send these creatures back to where they came from.
To undo the damage that was done so many years ago.
Time had done nothing but made you weak.
We have our own plans.
Immortality is a curse, brother.
Trust me. I've lived long enough to know.
We have to find that 13th monster.
-It's time to end it. -No!
Our time is just beginning.
-[Raphael] A little help, Don! -[Donatello] I'm on it!
[Michelangelo] Heads up, dudes!
-[ninjas groaning in pain] -[ninja yells]
[April] Guys! Front door's open. Now!
Two minutes for high sticking.
Dudes, that rocked! Let's go again.
Dudes, what do we do? I'm working on it.
You break it, you buy it. -[Casey grunts] -[alarm blaring]
Yeah! All right!
-[Casey] All right! Nice. -[Michelangelo laughs]
-Nice work, Jones. -Oh! [chuckles nervously] I have my moments.
Whoa! Check it out.
That would be the swirling vortex to another world, I assume.
[Casey] Cool. I want one.
Leo? Is that you? -[roaring] -[Michelangelo] Oh!
-[thuds] -Sorry! Wrong cage.
[Raphael] Leo! I got him!
[Donatello] Out of the way, please.
Hey, buddy. Come on, man. Up we go.
-[Leonardo groans] -[Raphael] There you go.
You're gonna need these if you're gonna lead us out of here.
I'm gonna need you, too.
-[April] Winters? -[Michelangelo] Looks more like fall, get it?
Mikey, remember our talk.
Looks like someone got to him before us.
[April] Is he dead?
Not so immortal, huh, dudes? -[gasps] -[all exclaim]
[April] Your time's run out, Winters.
Miss O'Neil.
I must have hit my head pretty hard,
I'm seeing giant turtles.
We know what you're up to, Winters.
We know about the portal and we think that it's time
We know about the portal and we think that it's time you sent all these monsters home.
[Winters] I couldn't agree with you more.
It is time to put an end to the curse that I have brought upon myself and this world.
to the curse that I have brought upon myself and this world.
That's what this is about, Miss O'Neil. Penance.
I must return all 13 beasts or our curse will continue.
And that is a torment I can no longer bear.
[Aguila] Then you should be put out of your misery.
I think we walked in on a family feud, guys.
The time has come to reopen the portal
and rain destruction upon the Earth.
Nothing will stand in our way
when we have an army at our command.
-My brothers. I… -We are no brothers to you!
With one monster still free, the curse will never be broken!
We shall finish what we began all those years ago.
And we will finally have our victory.
Join us. Join us, Foot Clan.
Swear your allegiance to us and no harm will befall you.
[scoffs] The Foot Ninja is not without honor.
We work for Winters, not you.
Okay, what does that mean?
It means we're going to help you.
My ninja will find the last monster,
and you will bring it back here.
Hurry, we don't have much time.
Hey. I got shotgun!
[Aguila] Forget about them.
By the time they return,
the portal will already be closed…
with you inside it.
I hate to see brothers fight like this.
Unless it's together.
Hate to rain on your parade, pal,
but we thought we'd even the odds.
We're going to enjoy this.
[Splinter speaks Japanese] [in English]If you please.
They can defeat them. They are a team.
[Winters] Let's hope so. Because if not, Aguila will use the portal
Because if not, Aguila will use the portal to draw forth an army of evil and the world will be lost.

More beasts.
Let's send them back where they belong.
-[groans] -[Donatello] Temper, temper.
Come to daddy.
[Raphael] Thing about you immortal stone guys is,
you know, you're immortal and made of stone.
I sound like Mikey.
You fight well. You should join us.
No, thanks, I'm good.
[Michelangelo] These guys really don't die. Sensei, are you all right?
[chuckling] We must do this more often. Hi-yah!
I still got it.
They'd better hurry with that last monster.
I'm sure my man Casey's got it all under control.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Can't this piece of junk go any faster?
-You wanna drive? -I would, as a matter of fact.
You would think they would be more concerned about the 13th monster.
Boys, we must finish this now!
So did we win?
[chuckling] Foolish creatures.
We are immortals made of stone!
Without the final monster to break our curse,
we will never be stopped!
[Casey] Special delivery!
-[Winters] Look out! -[turtles groan]
[Michelangelo] So did we win now?
[Donatello] Yeah, I think we did.
-[all cheering] -All right! Yeah!
-That's what I'm talking about! -[grunts]
-[wheels squeaking] -[Casey] Nice parallel parking.
Next time, I'm driving.
-[thudding] -[Casey] Hey! Watch the hair. -[April] Oh! -[ninja] Oh.
[Raphael scoffs] Typical. We do all the work,
he gets all the thanks.
You are every bit the warriors I was informed you were.
You have passed.
Savor your victory tonight.
For soon, we will have further business together.
The kind that involves familiar faces from your past.
She doesn't mean…
Looks like you picked a good time to come home.
Thanks… for bringing me back.
Winters?
I'm never usually that happy to be in pain.
[Donatello] He's happy because he's mortal again, Mikey.
April. I've had my eye on you for a long time.
I knew it.
I've always known that you'd be the one to help me find my way home.
And thank you… brothers.
You've made a very old man very, very happy.
So, um, what happens now?
Okay. Just a little bit creepy.
[sneezes] Oh, gross! I think he's in my…
[sneezes] Oh, gross! I think he's in my… My… My… [sneezes]
Oh, gross!
Somebody give me a hankie.
Oh. Oh! Now he's in my mouth.
[groans] Tastes awful!
[Raphael] You got room for one more?
[Michelangelo] Uh, can I get rid of this, too?
[Raphael] We live together. We train together. We fight together.
We stand for good, together.
We are ninjas.
We strike hard,  defend, protect,  and fade into the night.
defend, protect,  and fade into the night.
And there ain't no bad guy  or monster gonna  ever change that.
That's what's important.
And that's why  we'll always be brothers.
Oh, I love being a turtle.

[Annie] Child-rearing around the world boasts
a wide variety of customs and mores.
But perhaps the most bizarre social patterns
[Annie] can be found within the small island community of Manhattan.
[man] Asshole!
[Annie] The inhabitants of the region known as the Upper East Side,
have the most prosperous, yet idiosyncratic social systems on the planet.
After successfully mating and producing offspring,
the men are often distant and uninvolved,
leaving their women to hunt, gather and provide
for their families.
Yet the resourceful mothers of the Upper East Side
have plenty of time to participate in a variety of sex-role- specific activities.
These include body mutilation,
sacred meditation,
even fasting rituals.
Which brings us to our focus on child-rearing.
Who actually does it?
Well, in Africa, they have a saying.
It takes a village to raise a child.
But for the tribe of the Upper East Side,
it takes just one person.
The nanny.
Okay, so what's depicted here is not
a typical tribal ritual,
but rather the unraveling of one such nanny.
Actually, this nanny is me.
And why I'm telling off a teddy bear
is the subject of this field diary.
If by chance my report stereotypes
or geographically profiles, forgive me.
I'm not exactly an objective observer.

[Annie] A native New Jersey girl participating in a dreaded rite -of-passage ceremony. D'oh!
Oh my God! Spaz!
[Annie] And here's the woman who reared me,
pretty much all by herself.
She's a nurse.
Note the shoes.
What is it?
You'll see.
Wow. Thank you.
Thank you. [Judy Braddock] I know it's not much, but I wanted to buy you your first business suit.
Thanks.
Thank you. You can look back on this when you're a famous CFO.
Oh, Mom. Gosh, come on. It's one meeting at Goldman Sachs. It's highly competitive.
It's highly competitive. I'm probably never gonna get the job.
All right, stop with the negativity.
Your father was always negative and look where it got him.
[both] Double-wide trailer in Scranton.
Honey, I'm not kidding.
I would give the world to be sitting where you're sitting right now.
You are so much smarter than I was.
No man is gonna squash your dreams.
No one's gonna tell you how to live your life.
Maybe I'm not CFO material, you know?
No, what if I'm better suited at something else?
Like what? Anthropology?
Honey how are you gonna make a living at that?
Look, if you really wanna run around in grass skirts,
then make enough money to spend Christmas at Club Med.

Wow. Well, at least I'm not wearing last night's outfit at 8:00 a.m., party girl.
Let's just say that you missed a fabulous throw-down and Tom Waylan was there.
So? He asked about you. Twice.
All right, well, I gotta go. Real life awaits.
God. You know, I bet none of those cultures you study practice such rigorous celibacy.
You ever hear of the Shakers? [Lynette] Yes, and they're extinct.
[Annie] Excuse me, sir? -Sir. -Yeah?
I got off at the wrong stop. Can you tell me where Chambers Street is, please?
You see the building with the red umbrella? Yes.
It's about five blocks below that.
Oh shit.
[human resources director] Our financial analyst training program is so competitive.
We have over 8,000 applicants for 10 positions.
So, why don't you tell me, in your own words,
who exactly is Annie Braddock?
Wow, that's certainly an easy enough question.
Annie Braddock is a kind…
Well…
I am…
Go on.
Well, you see…
I have absolutely no idea. Excuse me.
[Annie] Who is Annie Braddock?
It wasn't exactly a trick question,
yet somehow I couldn't formulate a response.
Of course I knew all the basic facts.
The date of birth, home town, socioeconomic makeup.
But I didn't really know who I was, where I fit in,
But I didn't really know who I was, where I fit in, who I was gonna be.

[Annie] On that spring afternoon,
it seemed my future was finally set.
A Central Park bag lady I would be.
At least I'd finally get to live in Manhattan.
But before I officially surrendered to fate,
something, or rather, someone, intervened.
Hello there. Hi. Are you okay?
Get off of me, you pervert.
Do you belong to anyone, little man?
[Mrs. X] Grayer! I belong to you.
[Mrs. X] Grayer!
Oh God. Thank you so much.
You just averted a minor disaster.

is unfortunately not Annie Braddock.
♪ New York City girl ♪
She is, in fact, a perfect female specimen
She is, in fact, a perfect female specimen from the Upper East Side clan.
For the purpose of this case study,
we'll just call her Mrs. X.
Hi, I'm Mrs. X.
Let me apologize for my feral son.
Oh, no, no need to apologize. Please, I love kids.
I'm Annie. You're a nanny?
Oh! No, I'm not.
No wonder. You're so good with children. Oh, I'm not.
Actually, I just lost my nanny, Bertie,
which is why I'm out in this godforsaken park by myself.
Okay. She left us to go get married.
All right. Oh my God. Are you employed?
No, unfortunately I- Fabulous!
Look, here is my card.
Please, please, please call me later this week.
We'll schedule a lunch. Anywhere you'd like to go.
I'm sorry- The Mark, the Four Seasons.
Unfortunately, I have to run, but I really look forward to hearing from you.
I'm sorry, I really think you misunderstood me.
I have a very good feeling about this.
Call me.
[glamour mom] Pardon me, I couldn't help but overhear. I'm looking for a new nanny too.
Oh I- Can I give you my card as well?
Excuse me? I pay well above average.
I have a card too, call me.
I have a place in the Hamptons. Donald Trump lives in my building.
[Annie] It seemed that fate now offered me a wonderful alternative.
An opportunity to completely duck out of my life.
So, I decided for one summer to abandon Annie
and trade her in for a brand-new persona.
Nanny.
Of course, there was one tiny problem.
Everything I knew about nannying came from the movies.
Even so, I fell asleep confident
that I'd magically find my way.
[Lynette] Annie?
Annie!
[Lynette] Annie?
Get your feet on the ground, young lady.
[Annie] The fact that I had no child-care experience
mattered little to the matriarchs of the Upper East Side.
Even though I don't have a job,
I just don't seem to have enough time for myself.
[Annie] All they needed to know was that I was white,
a college grad, and terminally single.
As you can see, my husband and I are getting a divorce.
So, you and the kids must remain
on my side of the apartment at all times,
until the custody battle is settled.
Oh.
In short, I was the Chanel bag of nannies.
I heard through the grapevine you've been meeting with a lot of people.
So I thought you might appreciate a civilized lunch at Bergdorf's rather than
being interviewed at the apartment.
Thank you, that's very considerate.
Not really. I just love to eat out.
I'll probably come up with a million excuses for us to go have lunch.
If you end up with us, I mean.
[server] Ready?
Do you know what you're having?
I don't mean to rush you,
but I'm attending a 2:00 lecture at the Parents' Society.
Super mom, trying to juggle it all.
I'll just have the burger. Thanks.
I can't guarantee that the meat here is antibiotic-free.
But the chef here is from Brittany,
so I highly recommend the crepe Bretagne.
Deux, s'il vous plait. Okay.
[waiter] Excellent choice. Thanks.
You're from New Jersey.
Unfortunately. Oh no, there are some very lovely parts of that state.
Oh no, there are some very lovely parts of that state.
Friends of ours have a horse farm in Upper Saddle River.
Really? Mm-hm. I hear it's really nice there.
I'll have to take you riding there one day.
Okay. Tell me more.
I wanna know all about you.
I'm from Connecticut, actually. I went to Smith.
And don't believe the rumors, we weren't all lesbians.
After graduation, I moved here and started running Gagosian.
The art gallery.
It was a blast. But you really, you can't do that sort of thing when you're raising a child.
The parties, the schmoozing, the travel…
Oh, excuse me.
Oh.
Bitsy. It's you.
Bitsy. I've so been meaning to call.
Is there anything at all I can do?
Not unless you know a hit man.
That lawyer Jeanie Whitman recommended was no help at all.
I am so sorry.
Turns out all our assets are actually in Tucker's company's name.
All I'm getting is a million flat.
That's appalling.
If I'd known it would go this far, I would have just turned a blind eye.
Anyway, enjoy the rest of your lunch before I ruin that too.
I'll call you later this week, sweetheart.
Such a shame.
But she should have seen it coming. Everyone else did.
Anyway, where were we?
Ah yes. After Gagosian, I met Mr. X.
[Lynette] You know, my grandmother worked as a domestic so we wouldn't have to.
And here you are, fresh out of college,
voluntarily taking a nanny gig.
I told you, this is not a lifelong commitment, okay?
It's just a way for me to get my head together.
Besides, the money is great.
I finally get to move to the city.
I'm moving to the city to go to grad school, not to be somebody's servant.
Plus you know you're wrong, or you wouldn't be lying to your mother.
This is all just happening too fast.
I don't understand why you can't just live at the house for a while, just to get on your feet.
Mom, I lived at home through four years of college. Don't you think that's long enough?
Well, how could you find a decent apartment so fast?
The bank has, you know, an excellent program.
They've got me hooked up with a trainee, which is great.
I'm getting in the car. Can I come with you?
I would feel a lot better if I could at least see where you were living.
Come on. The other trainees, you know, they went to fancy boarding schools
and European exchange programs.
If I show up with my mom, I'll just look like a big dork.
Guess that makes sense.
Come here. I love you.
Let me know the minute I can visit you.
I'll call you when I get there, okay?

A little bit.

I'll see you soon, I'm sure.
Annie?
You know the path of least resistance?
It can lead through a mine field.
Oh, hi.
You are the new nanny?
Yes, and you must be Maria.
Nice to meet you. Hmm.
Can I come in? Okay.
Leave it there. The floor is clean.
This place is incredible.
I hope you last longer than the last one.
Who, Bertie?
Oh yeah, Mrs. X told me that she left to get married.
Married?
She had one date and she get fired.
Oh, Maria? Are you gonna tell Mrs.X that I've arrived?
Mrs. X is shopping. But she left you a note on the table.
Now I have to go run the vacuum, okay?
Ay.
Dear Nanny, welcome!
[Annie] Please make note that from here on in,
I'm referred to as Nanny by all the people in the Xs' social network.
[Mrs. X] I'm so excited to have you onboard.
Please make yourself completely at home.
Manuel is making you your own set of keys.
You should have them by tomorrow.
The fridge is well-stocked.
Tofu cutlets? Ugh.
Help yourself to anything. Yuck.
Sorry I could not be there to meet you
but I'm trying to squeeze in a little shopping before my Parents' Society meeting,
which reminds me, please pick Grayer up
which reminds me, please pick Grayer up from the Christian preschool at 2:15 sharp.
It's extremely important not to be late. Ooh.
As you can see, I have attached a list of basic house rules.
Hello, Manolo.
We believe it's important to maintain some sense of structure in our home
for Grayer's sake.
Rule number one: Grayer and his playmates
Rule number one: Grayer and his playmates are never allowed in the master bedroom. Oops.
Of course, you should refrain from entering our bedroom as well.
Rule number two:
Grayer is never allowed to nap during the day. No naps?
This throws his sleeping schedule completely off,
and I prefer him tired when I get home.
Rule number three: we just had the walls redone.
Please keep Grayer from rubbing up against them.
Oh! Rule number four: if school is ever canceled,
Rule number four: if school is ever canceled,
the following non-structured outings are permissible.
The Met, the Morgan Library, the French Culinary Institute,
the French Culinary Institute, the New York Stock Exchange.
Rule number five:
we do not take the subway because of germs. [Annie] Oh, God.
Rule number six:
Grayer still must be in a stroller when crossing Park or Madison. Blah, blah, blah, blah.
when crossing Park or Madison. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Rule number seven:
Grayer maintains a high-soy organic diet.
Rule number eight:
practice French with Grayer at least three times a week.
His father wants him to attend Collegiate where he's currently wait-listed.
French? Holy merde.
His acceptance is a top priority.
Mon Dieu.
Nanny?
Nanny?
What are you doing?
The note said to pick up Grayer from school at 2:15. Hm.
And it's only one o'clock.
So I was a little sweaty from moving and I thought that I would, you know…
What I mean is, what are you doing in that bathtub?
And why are your bags strewn all over the guest room?
I thought that was my room.
No.
No, Nanny.
This is your room.
Okay.
Yeah, this is very sweet.
I'm sorry. Do you have the time?
2:15. So they'll be getting out anytime now?
2:45. I'm sorry?
They get out every day at 2:45.
Dumbass.
[Annie] It quickly became clear that Mrs. X had arranged
[Annie] It quickly became clear that Mrs. X had arranged for me to arrive everywhere torturously early.
Get ready, ladies. Here they come.
Grayer? Grayer?
Grayer X?
Who is it you're looking for?
Grayer.
I know that one.
He plays with my wee monster, Darwin. Hay-ya!
Oh, Grayer, there you are.
Hey, little man, you remember me?
Yes, and I hate you!
What? Come on, we get along great, remember?
Like when we met in Central Park?
Let me get your backpack.
Stop.
Grayer, stop. Help, police! She's hurting me!
They usually start out that way, you know. Yes.
Danger, danger! Just be patient, eh?
Let me put you in your stroller, okay? Hold on one second.
I'm too big for a stroller! Grayer!
-Help, police! -Grayer! Grayer!
Grayer! Grayer!
Come here!
I hate you, I want Bertie! I know, honey. I know you want Bertie.
Bertie had to leave to get married or go on a date or something, okay?
But I promise, we're gonna have a lot of fun together, honestly. All right?
Now let me see how handsome you look in your uniform.
What's that?
Oh.
Don't touch that! It belongs to my daddy!
I hate you. I want Bertie.
Grayer.
[Annie] Already, one had to wonder,
what kind of culture would turn a father's business card into a security blanket?
Here we are. Home sweet home.
First mission accomplished.
Grayer, get up off the floor. It's very dirty.
I have an idea. Why don't we race to the front door?
Okay, last one there is a rotten egg.
I'm not stupid. You're just gonna let me win.
No, I am a mighty good runner, mister.
Not with your pants down. Oh my God!
Oh shit!
The stroller!
Shit! Grayer!
You said a curse. I'm telling Mommy.
Grayer, I am not kidding. Open this door right now.
Maria! Touch my fingers.
Ow! I am not letting go until you open the door!
Pardon me.
I think this belongs to Grayer.
Rode the elevator to the 12th floor.
Thank you. You're welcome.
Sorry, we're having a little bit of a situation here.
By the way, my name's [bleep].
[Annie] Since my job required a vow of chastity,
it was essential that I avoided all intimacies,
especially first names.
For the purpose of this field diary,
let's just call him Harvard Hottie.
I'm the Xs' new nanny. Oh.
Very new, as you can probably tell.
[Grayer] I'm taking off all my clothes.
Seems to be popular on this floor.
Mind if I take a crack at him for you?
Be my guest.
Hey, Grayer, it's your pal from upstairs.
Hey, would you be a sport and unlock the door?
It's not nice to lock people out.
Please, buddy?
Hey.
Why are you here?
Oh, I'm just helping out my new friend.
Annie.
Annie.
Annie the nanny.
She's your friend? Yes, she's my friend.
Isn't she your friend too?
Not yet.
Thank you. Anytime.
[Annie] Suddenly the world's most notorious loner
had two new men in her life.
Unfortunately, I knew that the big one was off-limits.
Based on my observations, guys like Harvard Hottie
Based on my observations, guys like Harvard Hottie only slum it when they're in college.
So, instead of following my heart,
I focused on finding a way into Grayer's.
Grayer, stop it.
[Annie] Befriending Grayer certainly wasn't easy.
La la la la la la! But then again, Margaret Mead didn't run home every time she contracted malaria. Whoa!
You're in trouble!
I thought this job was supposed to be a way to get your head together?
Two weeks in and you already sound depressed, dejected and paranoid.
You forgot to mention malnourished.
I swear, all these people eat is bean curd and seltzer. Ew.
Ew. I mean, even the ice cream is made out of tofu.
So why don't you come down and have dinner with us then?
My new roomie's making gumbo.
[roommate] It's not gumbo. It's Creole bouillabaisse.
I don't get it. You move to the city and overnight your life becomes "Will & Grace".
I'm here, knee-deep in… Shit.
It's probably my mom. She's the only one who has this number.
Bye.
Hello? Annie?
Hi.
My God. An entire week has gone by and you haven't called me back.
Mom, I told you I was gonna be so busy with work.
Oh come on. You can't find five minutes to call your worried mother?
How are you, honey? How's the job? How's the apartment?
God, everything is just perfect.
I mean, the job is a dream.
A little challenging. So rewarding though. And the apartment is just incredible.
And the apartment is just incredible. Yeah?
And my roommate could not be nicer.
Nanny, in the morning, I need you to stop at Tiffany's and pick up Mr. X's watch.
Then I need you to Xerox the recommendation letters for Grayer's Collegiate application.
Also, I was thinking, we should introduce
Also, I was thinking, we should introduce French food into his diet.
It might enhance his study of the language.
So tomorrow night, why don't you make him coquilles St. Jacques for dinner, hmm?
Annie? Dry cleaning.
Who was that, your roommate?
Mom, I have to go. I have some work stuff to take care of.
Wait a minute, I wanna make a plan to visit.
Hi, ladies.
So I took Madison to the doctor this morning.
She had grown three inches in six months.
You take her to the doctor too?
Darling, I do everything.
My job is a type C. Mmm.
Type C? What's type C?
Oh Jesus. Okay, newbie. Pay attention, honey.
Basically, there's three types of nanny gigs. Okay, type A, you provide couple time a few nights a week
Okay, type A, you provide couple time a few nights a week
Okay, type A, you provide couple time a few nights a week for women who work all day and parent at night.
for women who work all day and parent at night.
Type B, you provide sanity time, every afternoon, right,
to a woman who mothers in the mornings and the evenings.
And type C, the most common, you provide 24-7 me time
to the woman who neither works nor mothers.
So, which one are you?
I am type C. No question.
Although when I started I had no idea.
I thought it would be a kind of fun and easy job.
You'd think a college graduate
would choose a job a little more wisely.
Actually, this job kind of chose me.
Chose you?
Please, child.
I left my country because I thought I could give my boy
I left my country because I thought I could give my boy and my sick mother a better life.
I was supposed to be here two or three years tops.
And while I've been raising these strangers' children,
my own child has grown up without a mother.
That's how this job chose me.
Half a tablespoon of tarragon.
That's dried. -I like fresh. -Well, you know what?
-I like fresh. -Well, you know what? Dried's all we got, okay, kiddo?
I hate coquilles Jacques. I want sushi.
Well, then tell your mother you wanna learn Japanese. Mm!
Okay.
Ah!
Ha-ha!
I'm telling Mommy. You're in trouble.
Okay.
That's it.
No, Mommy says they're full of high-fructose corn syrup.
Well, what mommy doesn't know won't hurt her, okay, Mr. Tattletale? Eat it.
Go on. Right out of the jar.
It's okay.
It's yummy, isn't it?
This is fun.
Yeah? This is fun. This is fun.
And this fun meal has to be our little secret, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, you know, we can do lots of fun things. We just have to be friends and we have to trust each other.
Okay?
Maybe you should have a secret name too.
You want a secret name? Yeah, I want a secret name. Okay.
How about Sponge Bob? No, silly.
No?
All right, what about…
What about Grover?
Grover, I love Grover. You do?
All right. Grover it is.
[Mr. X] Where's my little munchkin?
Daddy! Daddy's home!
Yay, Daddy. I hear him, I hear him!
Daddy! Oh, there he is!
Oh my goodness, I'm sorry, are you a little monster? Remember what happens to little monsters?
Come here for a minute.
No, Daddy! You remember that or not? What's wrong with you?
Daddy! Come here for a minute.
You get viciously tickled. You remember that? -Huh? -Daddy, stop it.
Hey, you my little superstar? Yeah.
-Are you? -Yeah. Are you gonna take over the world?
Come on, answer me. You gonna take over the world?
Yes. And when are you gonna do it? Next year.
Next year's not soon enough.
Well, you must be Mr. X. I'm the new nanny.
Yeah? Keep him quiet tonight, will you?
I've got a merger I'm working on.
I don't get some decent shut-eye tonight, somebody around here's gonna be accountable.
Daddy, come see my dinosaur! Daddy's got work to do, buddy.
Please!
Hey, Grayer, don't be sad.
It's okay, Daddy's just tired.
Grover.
Hey, you wanna finish our fun meal?
Come on! Yeah.

Nanny?
Yeah, Grover?
You'll never leave me like Bertie, will you?
Grover, you know I- Promise?
I'm not going anywhere. You know that, right, honey?
Right, Grove?
[Mrs. X] Dear Nanny, please remember that today
[Mrs. X] Dear Nanny, please remember that today is the 4th of July family party at Mr. X's office.
It probably slipped your mind that costumes are required,
so I took it upon myself to have some delivered.
This is itchy.
I know, sweetheart.
Why do we have to dress up?
[Annie narrating] Freedom, Grove.
It's all in the name of freedom.
Hey, guys.
[Mr. X] Who is that? That's the nanny, dear. You've met her.
What happened to Louisa?
[Mrs. X] That was two nannies ago, silly.
Yeah? Daddy, I'm George Washington.
[Mr. X] Okay. [Grover] Tickle me! [Mr. X] No, I understand that, Dan, because the bastard's selling low.
[Grover] Please! [Mr. X] Grayer, come on, buddy. Cut it out, sit down.
Yes yes, we're coming. -We're coming. -[Mr. X] No, it's just my kid.
Well no, that's what I was thinking,
-I couldn't believe it. -Where's my card? [Grover] Daddy!- [Mr. X] Your what?
[Grover] Where's my card!
Oh, I wanna go home!
Hey, smile, Grove, we're gonna go to a party.
That's not my card. Where's my card? Would you get off that phone and tell the nanny
Would you get off that phone and tell the nanny
to give him his damn card?
Nanny? Turn the car around.
Talk to the nanny, please. Nanny, go back and get the card.
Hold the elevator!
I'm sorry.
It's okay, don't be. At least I'm fully dressed this time, so…
I'm so sorry. It's not funny. I don't mean to be laughing.
You look very patriotic. Well, yeah.
Let me hit your floor. Oh, no, that's okay. I got it.
I got it. Didn't grow up with the staff doing everything for me, so…
Neither did I.
Really? You must have had it really rough then.
Okay, well, I'm glad to give you a good laugh.
[woman] My husband and I are taking our second honeymoon in Provence.
I'm looking for Mr. X, have you seen him?
No, sorry.
I wouldn't know him if I did.
Grove, come on. What is wrong? Why won't you shake your booty?
'Cause I have to make a doodie.
Oh.
Hey, Grover, I think the bathroom's the other way.
My daddy has one in his office.
Yeah? I wanna go to my daddy's bathroom.
Okay.
Oh.
Why is Daddy tickling that lady?
I'm sorry. Grayer just had to use the bathroom.
So use it already.
Hello, Grayer. Remember me?
I work with your daddy in the Chicago office.
Let go. I have to make a doodie.
So, you must be the nanny.
Yes, I…
I'll get out of your… I'll wait in the hall.
So sorry.
Grayer, hurry up, your mom's coming.
Hey, sweetie. Did Grayer hear from the waiting-list committee yet?
No, why? Oh, I'm sure it doesn't mean anything,
Oh, I'm sure it doesn't mean anything,
but the Bairds did and Darwin got in.
Please don't say anything about Collegiate or Darwin to my husband.
Sure.
Oh, hi, pumpkin. There you are.
Oh, you've met before in Chicago, right?
-Yes, hello. -Lovely to see you. -Nice to see you as well. -Excuse me.
Thanks again. Mm-hm.
Where have you been? Making calls. Where's the chow?
The entire time? Yeah.
[Annie] Male monogamy remains an elusive
[Annie] Male monogamy remains an elusive yet much mythologized practice throughout the world.
In many Bedouin tribes,
powerful men are encouraged to take multiple wives.
In contemporary France, mistresses are de rigeur and quietly tolerated.
mistresses are de rigeur and quietly tolerated.
But for the women of the Upper East Side,
adultery is pathologically ignored.
[Mr. X] Nobody warned me we were gonna have a therapy session.
[Mrs. X] It's just that I didn't see you at all at the party.
Well, I was trying to sneak in a little work. Okay?
Forgive me for making a living.
But everybody else was participating.
Everybody else doesn't pull down what I do every year.
I had my family there and I was present and accounted for.
So now, you know, I would really appreciate a moment of peace and quiet, cause frankly I'm exhausted.
a moment of peace and quiet, cause frankly I'm exhausted.
Bonjour, Pierre. Bonjour.
Comment allez-vous?
Bien, merci. Et vous?
Ah, comme ci comme ça.
Okay, I got a great idea.
Let's pretend that we're in a cave.
You know what, Nanny?
What, Grove?
I love you best.
[Annie] The other nannies had warned me about this very moment,
the moment when you'll be tempted to break the cardinal rule of nannydom.
And yet, staring into those big, sad, searching eyes,
I simply couldn't resist.
I love you too, Grove.
Three little words made leaving this job 1,000 times harder.
[Mr. X] Hear a thing I have to say! I know that you work hard, I just think,
I know that you work hard, I just think,
that if we're gonna have more children…
Well, maybe you should focus on the one you already have.
'Cause you can barely handle him as it is.
Why are you so cruel to me?
Why? -Why? -Why are you so cruel? Because I cannot take the additional pressure.
You know something?
I think that I am going to go out to Chicago until this merger is finished.
Just stop it, will you, stop it. And I certainly hope that you're in a better mood when I come back. Please, stop it.
[Mr. X] All right?
If I come back!
Nanny. This is yours, is it not?
No. No, I don't know what that is.
It was in our laundry.
It is not mine, it is not Mr. X's,
so it has to be yours, right?
Right?
Yes, it's mine.
Please don't leave your personal items lying around the house again.
I won't. I promise. I'm sorry.
Apology accepted.
I don't mean to be a control freak.
It's just that when Mr. X is in the middle of a big deal, it can be very hard on me.
I understand.
How's Grayer doing?
Grayer?
He's fine. He's great.
That's good to hear.
He really is a wonderful child, isn't he?
He's the best.
He's such a sweet-
Okay, good night then.
[Mrs. X] Dear Nanny, I know it's
[Mrs. X] Dear Nanny, I know it's Sunday and you requested a day off,
but I desperately need to sleep in.
I have a very long afternoon today
tasting caterers for our benefit, Conga for the Congo.
Please don't wake me unless Mr. X calls from Chicago.
And most importantly, find a way to keep the boy quiet.
Why don't they just muzzle the kid already?
What's a muzzle?
Scrambled for you and Cheerios for the boy.
Mommy doesn't allow me to eat sugar cereal.
Cheerios are sugar free.
Low in sugar isn't the same as sugar-free.
Grover, just eat it.
Is that caffeinated? Mommy doesn't use caffeine.
That's because Mommy sleeps till noon.
[Mrs. X] Perhaps it might be a nice morning to do something educational with Grayer,
like the Pissarro show at the Guggenheim.
Mommy said you're supposed to take me to her favorite museum, the Guggyheiny.
Well, since today was supposed to be my day off,
we're gonna go to my favorite, the Museum of Natural History.
Isn't that on the West Side? Yeah, so?
I'm not allowed to go on the West Side. That's a rule.
Well, today just happens to be break-the-rules day.
Hi.
Two please.
Hey, you know what the biggest word in America is?
What? Antidisestablishmentarianism.
Hey, that's pretty good, Grove.
Actually, I know a longer word.
There is no longer word. Yes there is!
Supercalifragilis ticexpialidocious. Wow.
What does that mean? Come on inside.
Let me show you.
The apatosaurus, formerly known as the brontosaurus,
is from a family of enormous herbivores.
Herbivores means vegetarian. Like Mommy, you know?
What's that over there?
That is the T-rex.
Is that one like Mommy too? Hmm.
I wish my ancestors made totem poles.
[Annie] Well, they did. That one looks just like you.
Well, that guy has a big… [Grover] And it's hanging.
[Grover] And it's hanging.
Cool. What are they?
[Annie] They're a Matis family. They live in the Amazon.
[Gover ]Which one's the nanny?
[Annie] She has the day off.
Things are different in that part of the world.
[Mrs. X] And Nanny, one last thing before you take the rest of the day off.
Do you think you could manage a quick shop for me?
I'll help. No, it's okay, Grayer. Don't.
Grayer, don't, don't! God!
Mommy!
What a mess.
Really, Nanny, I don't know why you didn't leave all this downstairs with Manuel to store.
I mean, am I supposed to have this lying around the apartment till the benefit?
No no no, of course not. I'm gonna bring it down to him right now.
There's no time now.
I need you to get ready for the Nanny Conflict Resolution Seminar at the Parents' Society.
I totally forgot it was this evening.
Mrs. X, I don't know if you remember,
but I was supposed to have the evening off,
and I made plans.
The entire point of the seminar
is that everybody brings their nanny.
Are you suggesting I attend it alone?
No. I was just… I was confused. So, I will cancel my plans.
So, I will cancel my plans. I'd appreciate it.
Does anyone have an extra diaper I can use?
Stop eating them boogers!
Grayer, no nudity. Please.
Of course you feel anxiety when leaving your kids with strangers.
You're moms.
Okay, now what I would love to do is bring in the nannies.
Linda, Gillian, would you mind monitoring the children
so that the nannies can join us in here?
Okay, listen, I wanna see you all here next week.
The seminar is called sexy mom, happy mom.
It's gonna be a hot one.
Nannies, we're ready.
Right this way, ladies.
All right, here they are, the nannies! Wonderful. Come on in.
Just, file against this wall. Just squeeze in.
But be comfortable.
Terrific. Now that we're all together,
I think it's time to address the reason for this seminar:
improving nanny -mom communication.
To begin, I would like a mom volunteer
to offer the group one particular example of failed communication with your nanny.
Most of them barely speak English. That's the problem.
Okay, you.
My nanny keeps on singing religious songs to Parker
even though I have told her time and time again that we're agnostic.
And what's worse, every time I confront her she flatly denies it, even after I provided her
she flatly denies it, even after I provided her with evidence from the Nanny Cam.
Nanny Cam? I thought that was an urban myth.
That's my nanny over there.
Will you please ask her if she's trying to convert my child?
No. Right now we're just hearing issues.
Okay. Next I would like to hear from a nanny.
Can I have a nanny volunteer?
Anyone?
¿Por favor?
Come on, don't be shy. We won't bite.
Okay, how about you, young lady?
Me? Yeah, you.
Can you share with the group one particular grievance that you might have about your job?
Come on.
No, no. No, I love my job.
I do. I feel kinda lucky.
Oh, that's very nice, but neither helpful nor productive.
So can you please offer the class something useful? Come on.
Well…
It would be nice to have a night off, I guess.
A-ha.
We have been a little preoccupied with our benefit.
But all she has to do is ask. Uh-huh-huh-huh.
See, ladies?
Conflict resolved.
-I'm taking him. -Oh no, I can take him. No, it's all right. No, I can take him.
Nanny, please.
I want you to go out. It's only nine, you clearly wanted the evening off.
It's only nine, you clearly wanted the evening off.
No, you must be exhausted, let me put him to bed. We'll manage fine.
Here. Have a blast.
I just don't understand it.
I just don't understand how someone can have everything
and still be so miserable.
Anyway, remember I was telling you
Anyway, remember I was telling you I went to this orientation mixer thingy?
I met this guy who likes the same exact-
It's like she dumps all of her problems with her husband onto me.
It's called denial. Okay, like the river.
And you obviously have become her enabler.
What? What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means, Annie,  can you stop talking about this woman for five minutes please?
Well, I'm sorry I'm boring you, Lynette, but this is my life right now.
I have a life too, in case you haven't noticed.
And I'm starting to think you and that lady are kindred spirits.
You know what? NYU should give you your diploma right now.
You've got all the answers. Okay okay.
Okay, let's forget that. Forget that.
Can we at least try to have a good time?
Since you did drag me above 14th Street. Mm.
Come on, Annie. This place, you have to admit, it's…
Hmm, tired.
Look at these guys over there.
They don't have any piercings, no tattoos. I mean…
Oh my God. We have to go right now.
Why? Wait a minute. The guy I told you about is here.
Harvard Hottie? Mm.
Which one? Which one, where?
Yankees cap, blue shirt, blue blood. Mmm.
He is gorgeous. Yeah, okay, let's go.
No no no, are you out of your mind? You kidding me?
No no no, are you out of your mind? You kidding me? No, I'm out of my league, okay?
Let's go.
Oops.
What the hell are you doing?
Oh my God, I know that girl.
Annie!
Annie!
Come on, have a drink with him already.
I told you, I can't date on the job.
Are you gonna use this job as an excuse for everything or what?
Say hello to the nice fella.
Hey.
Guys, this is Annie.
I don't know your name, I'm sorry. Oh, Lynette.
Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you. I'm with some buddies from high school.
This is Carter, Jojo, John, Kenny, Reggie.
Nice to meet you. Sit, grab a chair.
-Oh no, we can't. -We'd love to.
So, girls, tell us, how do you know our boy here?
Oh, I really don't know him. He's Annie's friend.
I know him from work.
Oh, yeah?
What kind of work do you do?
Model?
Stewardess?
Escort?
She works for someone in my building. Oh.
Actually, I'm a nanny.
A nanny?
Dude!
You didn't tell us you knew a nanny.
That is so porno.
-Are the moms hot? -Guys.
Are you hot for the dads?
Are the dads hot for you?
Hey, come on.
You wanna know about the dads? I'll tell you about the dads.
They're chubby, bald, steak-eating, cigar-smoking, type-A pigs,
[Annie] who get more turned on by the Bloomberg Wire than they do by any hot nannies.
Actually, it's all of you in about five years.
So take it from me, guys, enjoy tonight
because your future looks pretty fucking bleak.
Wait. God!
Stupid stupid.
[answering machine voice] You have two new messages.
[Harvard Hottie] Hey, Annie,  it's me,
the big jerk from the bar.
What? [Harvard Hottie] Listen, in case you're wondering, your friend Lynette gave me your home number.
Ex-friend. [Harvard Hottie] I obviously owe you a major apology.
Please just don't judge me by my loser friends. Mm-hm. They were pretty hammered.
Anyway, I want you to give me an opportunity to redeem myself by taking you out.
And I'm warning you, I won't take no for an answer.
I know where you live, so I'll camp out at your door if I have to.
You really might as well just get this over with. And if you really hate me after that,
I'll never ask you again.
Okay, I'm sorry to ramble.
If I don't hear from you,
I'll ride the elevator til I find you.
Bye.
I am so screwed.
Annie,  it's your mother.
Look, I'm sorry that I didn't call last night, okay?
I had a really late night. But about tonight…
Okay, you know what, I don't wanna hear it.
I'm coming. I am coming.
All right, fine.
Fine, okay? Let me just call you after this play date, okay?
Play date? What the hell is a play date?
Oh shit.
You said a curse!
You know, Mom.
A play date. It's the meeting of preliminary investment schedules.
It's the meeting of preliminary investment schedules.
Look, I'll call you later, okay?
All right. Bye.
Who lives here?
Some kid named Jefferson.
Your mom found him with the Park Avenue play-date service.
Hi, y'all. I'm Jefferson's mama Tanya.
Come on in. We're baking a cake.
Oh my God.
Come on, boys!
I pretend to be Jefferson's nanny.
But I was really hired to watch her. Yoo-hooo!
And this is what she's like after Betty Ford.
Doesn't her husband care?
He's 75.
She's an ex-showgirl.
He's not complaining about anything.
Frosting fun!
Yay!
I wanna come here every day.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
And what is all over you?
Annie,  will you tell me what the hell is going on?
All right, listen up, people. This is my apartment.
And my roommate Lisa is away on business.
You are, just visiting.
He is- Lynette's new boyfriend. Fine.
I love your friends. What twisted game are we playing here?
We're playing the my mom is coming over
and if she finds out I'm a nanny then I'm screwed game.
I love it. Hey, should I whip up a fondue for Mom?
Well, you know what, if you're gonna play it straight, I would make it meatloaf.
I'm gonna borrow this. That's my dress. You can't borrow that dress.
It's a terrible dress.
Fondue?
Go get my dress.
Oh boy, Calvin. Thank you so much.
That looks delicious.
It's so festively presented too.
So, how did you and Lynette meet?
Annie's roommate Lisa introduced us.
It's a shame she's not here.
I used to date her too.
Really?
So, don't you just love Annie's new place?
Mm-hm.
We do. We're here all the time.
Yeah, I think it's very interesting.
It's a little small, but… Mm. It's a fine steppingstone, honey.
It's work. I'll take that.
Well, certainly keeping her busy. Very busy.
Mm-hm. Busy bee.
[woman] Relentlessly. Round the clock.
Hello?
This isn't a brontosaurus. You don't know anything.
Oh, Grayer! Please!
It is yoga hour and Mommy's on the phone.
Hello? Yes, hi. It's me.
I know that I agreed to let you visit your grandmother in the hospital tonight,
but I feel I need to remind you that tomorrow is Grayer's birthday.
What? How can that be? His party isn't until next month.
Well, we scheduled it that way on purpose
because the party planner I wanted wasn't available. Neither was my husband.
But as it turns out, Mr. X is coming home for two days from Chicago,
so we're planning a small family celebration.
Oh that's lovely. Grayer couldn't ask for a better gift.
And then afterwards, we'll all head over to the Carlyle for a more formal affair with friends. Obviously, I do expect you to attend.
Obviously, I do expect you to attend.
Okay, all right. So you will need to dress appropriately. Right.
Anyway, since you are not around to help,
I've taken care of everything. Mommy, play!
Thank you.
Also, some roses arrived for you.
Roses? Yes, very curious.
The card says, "Accept my apology, or else."
Oh, that's crazy Grandpa.
He didn't visit Grandma last night and we just let him have it.
Well, you know how Grayer is around pollen. So, I'll have to throw them out.
Annie? Oh, okay.
Well, you know, I am going to hang up
because the pacemaker isn't on. So I'll see you in the morning.
So I'll see you in the morning.
Oh gosh. Honey?
Yeah?
Are you okay? Mm-hm.
Perfect.
Dessert?
[Mr. X] This is of vital importance, are you aware of that? I don't think right now is the time.
I don't think right now is the time. You have absolutely no idea how disappointed I am.
[Grover] Clowns are supposed to be funny.
Well, they're French clowns, Grove.
I hate them and I hate my birthday.
In order to clean up your mess! Do not interrupt me!
Now you told me that the extra year of preschool would guarantee him a spot.
Today he's six. What's your plan now?
I'll be back, okay?
[Mr. X] We should try to be calm. My brother's kids got in.
That isn't enough of a humiliation. I will not tolerate at this point-
There are mimes in the next room and I suggest you keep your voice down.
You know what?
Hey.
What the hell are you doing here?
I wanna know why you threw my flowers away.
I found them in the stairwell.
I didn't throw them away, okay? My lunatic employer did.
And if you don't get out of here right now, she's gonna throw me out too, okay?
Not until you agree to see me. What?
This has got to stop. Come on, one date. That's all I'm asking here.
Oh, fine fine, okay?
After work on Thursday. Go go.
Nanny.
Before we head over to the Carlyle,
I would like you to know why Mr. X is so upset.
It seems that Grayer was rejected for admission to Collegiate.
I'm very sorry. That must be upsetting.
Not upsetting. Unacceptable.
Stop it! Get away from me!
Oh, sweetheart. Don't be afraid. They're only clowns.
I hate them. They're nice French clowns.
They scare me!
Grayer, go to your mommy. Huh-uh. Go to your mommy, Grayer, go. No.
Go on, sweetheart.
As I was saying, Nanny,
we feel that you are not spending enough time
we feel that you are not spending enough time on educational activities with our son.
Therefore we have decided to hire a consultant to fully research the situation.
He will demand extra time from you this week.
Whatever's best for Grayer. Starting Thursday evening.
Do you read to the child from The Wall Street Journal?
Financial Times?
Granta?
I sing to him in French.
Well, we need more time than I thought to get to the bottom of this.
I know. I know, I'm very, very late. I'm sorry. Did you get my message?
Yep, all six of 'em.
I couldn't get out of work. The consultant kept me forever. It was horrible.
Yeah, well, not only did I lose the reservation, but the kitchen is now closed, so…
Okay. I'm sorry I was late.
Sometimes these things just don't work out, okay?
Wait, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Think you can just get rid of me that easily?
No, it's not about getting rid of you. It's just that no place around here stays open this late. That's all.
Actually, I know the perfect place.
Pretty good, huh?
Number one slice on the Upper East Side.
It's not bad.
I'll tell you what though, it doesn't touch the Jersey Shore.
Well, if you're such a pizza connoisseur,
there's a really great place in Italian Harlem. I'll take you there sometime.
Harlem?
I have a hard time imagining you in Harlem.
Why? I enjoy exploring my city.
I enjoy exploring my city. Something you should probably do more of.
Something you should probably do more of.
Thank you. I'll try to squeeze that in between
cleaning up Grayer's vomit and picking up Mrs. X's laundry.
Come on, if your job is that bad, why don't you just quit?
I mean, it's not like you're on a career path here. I don't understand.
No, of course you don't understand.
You've obviously lived a very charmed life.
Growing up on Fifth Avenue. You went to Harvard.
A charmed life?
Okay. Now I get it.
You know, for your information,
my mother died when I was four.
My father traveled constantly for work. I was raised by nine different nannies
I was raised by nine different nannies
until I was old enough to get shipped off to boarding school.
That's how charmed my life was.
I'm really sorry. But you know something?
I still think I turned out to be a pretty decent guy in spite of it all.
I guess I'm officially an asshole.
Well, asshole is a pretty strong word.
I would have gone with jerk or bonehead.
But that's just my prep school upbringing.
I don't know, you know, I just… I would love to quit.
I really would, but I…
I can't leave Grayer.
I can't.
You're gonna think I'm totally crazy, but I feel really bad for her also.
Do you think I'm crazy?
Well, you know, you could be suffering
from Stockholm Syndrome. You ever heard of Patty Hearst?
Are you kidding?
Yes.
But I do think you should probably let me kiss you right about now.
What?
Well, we're two blocks from your building.
And once we get any closer, I won't be able to go near you.
Which, to tell you the truth, is all I've really thought about since that day I saw you in that Betsy Ross getup.
That is really kinky and weird. You don't know the half of it.
You don't know the half of it.
Good night. Good night.
Pleasant evening. Yeah.
Good night.
Look out for the…
Sorry.
[Annie] While doing field work, anthropologists have been known
[Annie] While doing field work, anthropologists have been known to lose themselves in the very society that they're studying,
a phenomenon known as going native. When this occurs, the proper course of action
When this occurs, the proper course of action
When this occurs, the proper course of action is to remove oneself ASAP.
After my night with Harvard Hottie,
it became quite obvious that my obsession with the Xs meant I'd gone native.
Daydreaming in the park that day,
I came to the conclusion that the only right thing to do
was confront Mrs. X and quit.
Oh, I forgot about this.
Wow.
This could work.
See if you can find me something short.
It'll go better with this neckline.
Okay.
Oh.
Did Grayer get you this?
God.
I bought this for my mother when I was 10.
She got mad at me, refused to wear it.
She said it was common.
I think I saved it out of spite.
How about this?
Mr. X bought it for me for our first wedding anniversary.
So it's only fitting that I should wear it tonight, right?
Definitely.
Mrs. X, I need to talk to you about something.
I know you're really busy tonight,
so I was wondering if we could schedule some time tomorrow night to talk.
What is it, Nanny?
I think it's better if we talk alone.
What is it?
Nanny, lend a hand.
Well?
You look amazing.
Really? You look very pretty, Mommy.
And you like the Dior?
I mean, I know it's a little much for dinner,
but afterwards he's taking me to the President's Circle Gala at the Met.
Well, I couldn't imagine a more perfect dress for a romantic anniversary.
All I need now is my husband.
I just called the airport. There wasn't a single delay or cancellation out of Chicago,
There wasn't a single delay or cancellation out of Chicago, so…
Where can that man be?
Nanny, call La Grande Nuit and tell them we're running late.
Nanny, call La Grande Nuit and tell them we're running late. I don't wanna lose the reservation.
Is it Le Grande Nuit or La Grande… L-E… L-E-S?
I think it's L-A.
Thanks, smarty-pants.
Hello?
[Mr. X] Yeah, it's me. Listen, I'm losing cell service here.
I need you to find my wife and explain to her that my flight was canceled.
And since I'm gonna have to be back here Sunday night, I'm just gonna spend the whole weekend in Chicago. No no no…
[Mr. X] Make sure to tell her I'm sorry. No no no, Mr. X, you can't do this.
No no no, Mr. X, you can't do this. Look, she…
Nanny, who was it?
What did he say?
He said that his flight was canceled.
And he's very, very sorry.
Make sure you put that one on top. I don't want anything to wrinkle.
Mommy, where are you going?
Mommy, don't go! No, Grayer… No, Grayer. Don't be difficult.
Mommy has to go away for a few days to get some rest.
Nanny, I've decided to take a few days off.
I'll be at the spa at Canyon Ranch in Lenox.
Maria has all my numbers.
Oh God.
[Grover] Nanny, can we go upstairs?
I feel funny.
Oh my God! How did this come on so fast?
104?
Oh my God, oh my God. Okay, okay.
Honey, come here. You okay?
I'm so sorry.
That's okay, that's okay.
All right.
Okay.
Wait, no.
Hey, Lynette, it's Annie. Listen, I need your help. Grayer has a temperature of 104
and I have vomit all over me and there's nobody here. God.
Did you call his mother? Yes, I called his mother.
She's at some friggin' spa. I left three messages and she won't call me back.
I don't know what to do. I mean, should I take him to the emergency room or something?
or something? [Lynette] Annie, I can't answer that.
I…
Do you know a number of a doctor I could call for advice, or a nurse even?
Of course I know a nurse.
Your mother.
[Grover] Nanny?
Lynette, I have to call you back.
What is it, sweetheart? What's wrong?
I want my mommy.
Me too.
How is everything?
His fever's down.
But I think he's got the croup.
The steam should help open his passages
and hopefully it'll ease up his cough and he can get some rest.
Is there anything I can do?
Just close the door.
He's okay now. Much better.
Oh, thank you, God.
Even so, you should bring him to the doctor in the morning.
He's probably gonna need a prescription.
Okay.
Hey, Ma…
I don't know how to thank you for coming here, and helping-
Why'd you lie to me, Annie?
I have never lied to you.
Ever.
I know.
I just…
Oh, Mom, I couldn't handle it anymore.
-I just couldn't handle it. -What? What couldn't you handle?
You're young, you're smart, you're energetic.
You got this incredibly bright future ahead of you.
It was too bright, Ma. All right? I just, I got… I had to get away.
And do this?
You understand? Every night shift I worked, every overtime hour I accepted,
Every night shift I worked, every overtime hour I accepted,
I did it because I wanted something better for you -[door closing] -than I had.
Nanny! Good, you're up.
Just leave that there.
So listen, the spa was just awful,
totally overrun with suburban riffraff.
And then in the middle of my body scrub,
Mr. X called and believe it or not,
Mr. X called and believe it or not, he wants to take us all to Nantucket next week.
he wants to take us all to Nantucket next week.
So I figured I might as well cut my trip short and…
Who's this?
I'm Judy.
It's my mom.
You never mentioned you had a mother, Nanny.
My mom's a nurse. She came over here to help me.
Grayer's been very, very, very sick. I tried calling you…
Where is he?
Well he's sleeping now.
Then he can't be that sick now, can he?
So listen, could you quickly unpack my luggage and just put everything in the laundry?
I'm exhausted and Mr. X is expected sometime before 9:00.
I will see you in the morning.
Oh, very nice to meet you, Julie.
Judy.
Call me when this phase of your life is over.
[Annie] I desperately wanted to yell out after her,
but it was like one of those awful dreams where I had no voice.
My desire to be an observer of life
was actually keeping me from living one.
[man] Clearly, the woman's heinous.
You gotta quit. It's just that simple. I can't, all right?
I tried.
What if I made you a tempting offer?
I'm gonna go to my father's house in Southampton for a month.
I gotta take some time, figure out if law school is really right for me.
Why don't you join me? Do a little soul-searching.
We'd get the whole house to ourselves, won't cost us a cent.
We'll walk on the beach, we'll drink red wine, grill fresh fish.
That sounds like heaven.
But what if this vacation can save their marriage?
If I quit now, I'll ruin it and break Grayer's heart.
What about my heart? Do I count for anything?
Come on, say yes.
Be young with me in the Hamptons.
Don't go to Nantucket with the weirdos. What do you say?
Not a chance in hell, is there?
I can take a hint. Come on, I didn't say no.
You weren't exactly screaming yes though, were you?
I'm starting to wonder if you're really selfless or just a little self-obsessed.
Thank you. Thanks.
I have to go.
Listen, if you change your mind, my offer stands.
We're going to 'Tucket! We're going to 'Tucket!
Guess what else? I'm getting a puppy.
Oh my God!
Daddy, Daddy, where's my puppy?
Been waiting for you right up in the car there, sport.
Isn't it wonderful?
Mmm. A family trip has been long overdue.
Mm. Listen, I didn't want to say anything in front of Grayer, but the truth is, I can only stay for a few days.
They're really pushing me to finish up in Chicago.
You can't be serious. You're not gonna leave us on this island alone.
Okay, we'll talk about it later.
♪ I'm gonna be your number one ♪
♪ Oh no ♪ Hi. It's Annie. I haven't heard from you in a while.
You're probably in Southampton,
but I just wanted to let you know that my cell phone doesn't work here.
So if you wanted to call… if you wanted to call,
you probably have the number already on your cell phone,
but I will give it to you just in case. It is 508…
Hello?
Oh.
What, hello?
Hello, Nanny? I need to use this phone. Immediately.
Okay, so sorry.
Oh God. Nanny, we're going to the beach.
[Grover] When I grow up, I want enough money to build a real castle.
[Annie] Just remember, Grove, that money can't buy love.
[Grover] But Mommy pays you money and I love you.
[woman] Surprise surprise, dear.
Mother? My, you've gotten portly.
Hi, Grandma.
What the hell are you doing here?
Ask your wife. She's the one who requested I come.
Darling, I- Not that I need an invitation.
It is my house.
I just wanted your mother to be here for the news.
News, what news? What in the hell is going on here?
I'm having another baby.
[Mr. X] Virtually impossible! What exactly do you want?
And you invited my mother here so that I can't go back to Chicago.
I can't go back to Chicago. [Mrs. X] One lousy week! [Mr. X] You know something?
You are an infuriating woman. You really are!
That's what you get for rejecting debutante season.
[Mr. X] Who asked you, bitch?
Can you look after the kids for a minute? I'm the only nanny here.
I just have to use the restroom.
Make it snappy, dear. I'm on the last chapter.
Oh, thanks a million.
You look gorgeous.
[Mrs. X] Listen, I need some nanny advice. [woman] Okay.
[Mrs. X] To tell you the truth, I don't know what's gotten into her lately.
Well, I installed a Nanny Cam.
So we'll soon see the truth.
[woman] It might be time to let her go.
[Grover] I saw another one.
Make a wish, Grove.
I wish we could stay in 'Tucket forever,
Mommy, Daddy, you and my puppy.
Grove?
You know I… I'm not gonna be your nanny forever.
I can't be.
That doesn't mean I'm not gonna always be your friend.
What, there's no OJ in the goddamned shit-shack?
Oh, I was just about to make some.
Where's Grayer? Isn't he up yet?
He had a little trouble sleeping, so…
Concentrate? You have got to be kidding me.
All my money and I can't get fresh-squeezed? Come on.
We used it all at the party, so…
Hmm.
Well then, why don't you and I take a little trip to the market and get us some, huh?
I'm not in right now. Leave it at the beep.
Where's Grayer? With his grandmother.
And where, may I ask, have you been?
I just had to clear my head. Did you?
I imagine your unacceptable behavior has something to do with that boy in the building.
Nanny.
I wasn't born yesterday.
He called several times this week.
He called? Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me? I suppose I forgot.
It's really for your own good.
He's a little out of your league, don't you think?
It couldn't possibly end well.
Clearly this isn't working out.
Mr. X has arranged for a taxi to take you to the ferry
and then for a car to pick you up on the other end.
Please don't… Please don't do this.
Not for me, but for Grayer.
Not until you and your husband work your problems out.
Don't you dare.
You stupid… You stupid girl.
As if you know anything about my life.
As if you know anything about the real world.
All I got's 100. All right, you know what?
Just give me the change when you come back for my mother at some point, okay? Keep 10 bucks for yourself, all right?
Nanny.
Here's your final payment.
I expect you to have all your things out of our apartment by the time we come back.
Just leave the keys with the doorman.
Grayer, I think you should take a nap. I'm certainly ready for one.
Nanny! Where are you going?
Nanny! Grayer. Grayer. -Stay here. -Nanny! Here.
What are you doing? Take it, take it.
What? I can't tolerate the yapping. Grayer's too young anyway.
Nanny! Grayer. Nanny, don't go! Grayer, sweetheart…
Nanny, wait!
Nanny! Grayer! Nanny, don't leave me.
Nanny!
Grayer.
What?
Go ahead, puppy, do your business. Anywhere you like.
Good puppy!
Nanny Cam, Nanny Cam, where are you hiding?
[toy] I love you.
Hola.
Hmm.
Aha!
Okay, lady, you want Nanny Cam?
I'll give you nannies gone wild.
And this is how the most significant confrontation in my life
happened with a teddy bear.
After the abrupt termination of my field work,
I took some time to make sense of all that I had witnessed.
During this period I read that critics of anthropology
believe that just by observing a culture
you inevitably change it. -Mm! -Ow!
Hey.
In the many times that I thought of Grayer,
I secretly hoped those critics were right.
This is a tape of my latest nanny disaster.
She was extremely problematic, to say the least.
She neglected Grayer. She drank.
She even flirted with my husband.
I finally had to fire her for promiscuous behavior
I finally had to fire her for promiscuous behavior with a boy in the building.
This videotape shows her feeding my child peanut butter and jelly directly from the jar.
peanut butter and jelly directly from the jar. You know, I remember this nanny.
You know, I remember this nanny. She had a very peculiar attitude.
Let's watch.
You excited about going to Nantucket? Yes.
Okay, well, why don't you close your eyes and you can dream about building sand castles?
I love you, Nanny.
Good night. This must be the wrong tape. I've never seen this one before.
It's all right, just let it play out. We'll get something good.
It's a problem. Big problem.
Okay, Mrs. X, now it's time for a few simple child-care rules.
Oh, all right. The teddy bear has been compromised.
Slamming the door in your kid's face is not okay.
Spending more time on a benefit for kids you've never met
than you do with your own blood is not okay.
Going to a spa when your son has a fever of 104
and not answering emergency calls, that officially makes you an unfit mother.
This is outrageous. Stop the tape.
No, this is clearly a disgruntled nanny.
We might have something to learn here.
Yeah, I know that you're really busy with your hair appointments and your Watsu massages
and your attempts to stay young so your husband won't leave you,
but here's an idea,
why don't you try eating dinner with your child every once in a blue moon?
And a head's up here, lady.
Try smiling once in a while.
People hate you!
As for you, Mr. X, who the hell are you?
Maybe you're asking the same about me.
I know you've noticed my ass, but you probably don't recognize my face,
so here's a little hint, okay?
I'm the one who's been raising your son.
Grayer is not an accessory.
His mother didn't order him from a catalog.
Your son, your wife, are people in your home,
human beings who are drowning in their desire
human beings who are drowning in their desire for you to just look at them.
You know, the truth is, I don't wish either of you harm.
If for no other reason than you having
the profound privilege of being Grayer's parents.
Grayer loves you.
He doesn't care what you're wearing
or what you buy him or what school he gets into.
He just wants you there.
That's it.
And time's running out, and he won't love you unconditionally that much longer, so,
for your own good, don't miss out on getting to know him.
He's truly an amazing, amazing little person.
Excuse me. Of course.
Of course.
Buenas noches.
It's a much tougher game out there for women.
Nature deals us some tricky cards.
Is that so hard for you to understand? No.
I don't know, Mom. I just…
So I guess you're not going into finance?
I don't think that having money makes it any easier.
You know, I know that now.
It's okay. It's your life.
Personally, I think you're making a big mistake.
But it is your life.
I want you to be happy.
Hey.
Hayden.
[Annie] Oh, that's right. I forgot to mention his name is Hayden.
And once I finally let myself say it,
it was a habit that was pretty hard to break.
It's going pretty good actually.
There's more scholarships out there than I thought.
Why are you so late?
Because I have something for you.
It's from your former employer.
What?
She cornered me on the 12th floor,
figured I could get to you before she could.
I don't wanna read this.
Why don't I read it to you? Okay.
Dear Annie.
It's been several months since we've spoken.
Even so, the things you said on that tape haunt me every day.
And now looking back, I don't know what to say
except thank you.
-And I'm sorry. -[Mrs. X] And I'm sorry. You were so right.
Of all my privileges, Grayer is my greatest.
I desperately needed someone to show me that.
You did.
And for that, I owe you the world.
You may or may not be surprised to learn
that I've left my husband.
Not out of the jar.
Try it.
Any man who made me feel desperate enough to feign a pregnancy wasn't worth fighting for.
to feign a pregnancy wasn't worth fighting for.
Isn't it good?
Yeah.
Yeah, it is good. [Mrs. X] So I'm pretty confident that in time
we'll be getting along just fine.
Yeah, it's really good. It's really good.
Please know that I wish you all the best in life.
Sincerely, Alexandra.
P.S. I'm happy to report that Grayer asks for you
I'm happy to report that Grayer asks for you a little bit less every day and every night.
Come on. Okay. Let's get out of here.
Catching the Yankees game with my dad tonight. Sounds wonderful. Yeah.
[Annie] There's a popular belief amongst anthropologists
that you must immerse yourself in an unfamiliar world
in order to truly understand your own.
I've probably gotta get going soon actually.
See you later tonight, okay?
Yeah.
I certainly hope so.
[Annie] In conclusion, I hope this field diary
has been illuminating for those considering my application to graduate school.
It certainly has been for me.
[Annie] After a lost summer of being Nanny,
I finally got to know Annie.

how you hung on my every word.
You are now in the arms of another.
Who is he, this man?
-[laughing] -Does he have poise? Does he have grace?
Is he a lover or a fighter?
What powers does he have over you?
Do your eyes dance like fireflies in the night when he comes to you?
Does your body soften as your lips shape his name?
I can’t believe you’ve been so selfish.
-[gasping] -Open the door!
Open up!
You are consumed by love.
It’s Mr. Carson Clay.
How does he cast a spell over you?
Enchant you? Beguile you?
Why did you shut me out?
[Clay] Come on, come on!
Where is he?
Where’s the projectionist?
I struggled to survive.
When I look back on the darkest moments of our history,
I know that we would part.
Whose is this?
And that now, I must... -Huh? -...let you go. Aah! Ow! Oh– ow!
We will know a deeper, -surer love. -[Mr. Bean groaning]
It begins fleetingly, but it deepens and endures.
It grows amidst all the strangeness of life.
It is a beauty we can always depend on.
It is the beauty of friendship.
Stop!
He stole my son!
No! He didn’t!
Where’s my son? Where is he?
He’s just here–
-Son– -Papa!
-Stepan! -Mama!
[Clay] A very strange thing happens when you’re making a work of art.
Sometimes you, uh, don’t quite see the elements coming together,
and then when it all comes together, there’s something magical, something organic,
there’s something magical, something organic, and such a thing happened today, and...
everyone said this wouldn’t work.
They said it was a terrible risk.
But I wanna keep on making films just like this.
The video/film combination.
It’s something that’s really been done before, -but not quite like this. -[Mr. Bean gasping]
Uh, I’m glad the reception was so great,
It's now 12 noon in Salamanca, Spain.
In a short time, world leaders from over 150 countries...
...meet here in Plaza Mayor...
...to sign up to President Ashton's bold new counterterrorist strategy.
Since 9/11, more than 4500 people have been killed...
...in the rising tide of global terror.
Those lives will not soon be forgotten...
...as today, the world comes together to take a stand against this violence.
We may be on the brink of a historic agreement...
...between Western and Arab leaders.
Security services are on high alert in Salamanca...
...where we go live to our news team and our reporter Angie Jones.
Five, four, three, two....
I am standing inside Plaza Mayor in Salamanca, Spain...
...where crowds have lined up for the kickoff of...
...what is without question a landmark summit.
For months, President Ashton's been working...
...with leaders from five continents...
...to forge a new groundbreaking alliance in the ongoing war on terror.
And now here, today...
...Western and Arab leaders will meet for the first time...
...to formalize this new coalition...
...designed to once and for all...
...put a stranglehold on international terrorism.
-Bring him up. -Cue Mark.
-Tell us, Angie, what's the mood like? -For the most part, hopeful.
Everyone here is very sympathetic to those...
...who lost loved ones in the recent bombing.
I did, however, speak to delegates...
What's she doing?
...both of whom took a hard line, suggesting that U.S. foreign policy...
Kevin, shut her down.
...has to bear some responsibility for the recent events.
Thanks, Angie. You'll have to keep us informed.
- What the hell was that? - Not everyone loves us, Rex.
Why don't you leave the punditry to someone paid to have an opinion?
I'm cool with censorship. I know the American people love that.
-Come on, Angie. Lighten up. -Got it.
-Gallery. -Pass me over.
-Bruce. -Yes.
-What was that? Stick to the script. -I told her. Wanna tell her?
-Fine. -That's fine.
-Who is the clown on two? -Two is Luis.
Camera two, are you gonna move?
We're here for the summit, not the sideshow.
Man, it's like training a freaking dog.
Okay, everybody, the president is about to arrive.
When he does, we're on him. Let's get our ducks in a row.
Three, wider. Four, stay where you are.
Kevin, keep it moving. I'm dying here.
Camera five, give me the motorcade.
Number seven, concentrate. I wanna go close on the president.
All right, sir.
That's good.
Tighten up, five. Good.
-Isn't that...? -It's Thomas Barnes.
Why didn't we know he was here? Shit, Grace. We should've had this.
Yeah, I don't....
-Kevin, pull the archives. -Pull the archives, please.
The president's approaching the plaza. All cameras ready.
Angie, we're back in 20.
And remember, we're here for the summit, not the sideshow.
-There are other stories. -I don't give a shit.
Unless the protesters set themselves on fire, they're not our story.
-Kevin, you got it? -Yeah.
Check this out.
This was only last year. I can't believe he's back already.
If we're the only ones who have this....
He won't talk. A year ago we had Hill, we had that guy who saved Reagan.
-McCarthy. -All of them.
A hero piece. Barnes wanted nothing to do with it.
That was then.
It's a shame. It would've made a great side story. We've no time to work it in.
That was then, this is now, okay, guys? We've got our story.
Okay, cue graphics.
Camera five, give me a single.
-Here comes the mayor. -Three, four, ready at the podium.
Three, wide. Four, in close. Start with the leaders and end with the mayor.
-Thank you so much for being here. -Three, pull back.
Yes. Camera six, get ready. We're coming to you.
Good. That's good.
-Two, give me crowds. -De Soto speech ending in one minute.
Camera five, give me something else to work with. That's good.
Angie, when this is over, I want a 15-second fill to wrap it up.
-Keep it simple. -You mean dumb it down?
Get off it, Angie. Come on.
She's unbelievable.
I offer you my city....
The mayor's done in five. Ready with the graphics.
This summit could be the defining moment of his presidency.
Pull out, four, three--
Oh, my God.
The president appears to have been shot.
-Shit. -I heard two shots...
-...and the president fell. -Who's that guy?
What's he doing?
Okay, five, stay with that guy. Everyone else, give me Ashton.
Three, stick with the president. Just stay with him.
That's good. Just stay with him. Stay with him. Hold it there.
This is insane.
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming back.
-Camera three, do better. -They're not letting me through.
Don't give me this bullshit. Figure it out.
Okay, you got him?
-What was that? -There appears to be an explosion....
Camera four, turn around. Find out what that was.
Kevin, get playback going. We have to uplink everything we've got.
-Bruce. -Uplink VTs 1 through 7 on my monitor.
Okay, Angie, you're on. Let's go.
We're live, Angie. This is it. Go.
I need a minute, Rex. All right?
Shit. Get Mark to stretch.
I know this is tough, okay? I know that.
We need you to tell us what's going on.
-Okay. -Focus, okay?
Angie? Please, tell us what you're seeing.
-Deep breath. Go. -The president of the United States...
...has been shot. There have been several gunshots.
It appears there was also a bomb that went off outside the plaza.
There are people running scared--
Oh, shit!
Mark?
Mark, you gotta fill.
It seems that a huge bomb....
Oh, my God. Angie! Angie!
At the moment, smoke from the explosion...
...mercifully covers the extent of the human carnage.
There must be many people dead and injured.
-Angie. -This truly is terrible.
Come on, kiddo, get up.
Get up.
Kevin, pull the feed.
Turn it off!
Good morning, America.
It's now 12 noon in Salamanca, Spain.
In a short time, world leaders from over 150 countries--
It's time.
--Plaza Mayor to sign up to President Ashton's...
...bold new counterterrorist strategy.
Since 9/11, more than 4500 people...
...have been killed in the rising tide of global terror.
Those lives will not soon be forgotten, as today...
...the world comes together to take a stand against this violence.
We may be on the brink of a historic agreement...
...between Western and Arab leaders.
Security services are on high alert....
All teams, this is Control.
-Motorcade one minute to landing. -Copy.
-Level 4B, clear. -Roger, Control.
-It was before he lost it. -Come on.
-Guy had a nervous breakdown. -Six months ago.
He's not that guy anymore. Give him a break.
What are the chances he freaks out the minute we walk?
I'd put it at fifty-fifty.
We doing this?
Mr. President.
All teams, this is Control. Eagle is on the move.
Tell us, Angie, what's the mood there?
For the most part, hopeful.
Everyone here is very sympathetic to those...
...who lost loved ones in the recent bombing.
Thanks.
For what?
For getting me back out here.
Don't thank me yet.
Mr. President?
Here we go.
All right, sir.
What a beautiful baby.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
It's a wonderful day.
Hey! Drop it.
Not now.
-Michael team's go for count off. -All clear from above.
-And south? -Yeah. Here too.
President Henry Ashton.
Welcome. Thank you so much for being here.
This is a wondrous day.
Today, we make history.
Señor Presidente, fellow members of the European Union...
...our friends from Africa, Middle East...
...President Ashton, citizens of the world...
...it is with great pleasure that I invite you all to our humble city.
And it is with a sad heart...
...that we must meet in mourning...
...for those who lost loved ones in the recent bombings.
Back annex, the building should have been cleared.
Copy. It's clear.
I've got a flutter on the second floor.
Seventh window from the left.
-Copy. We'll check again. -The hopes of the world...
...are with us.
Let us not disappoint them.
For we cannot today...
...or ever, let the specter of evil...
...overcome the hope of a better tomorrow.
It's just a fan that's been left on. We got it.
Therefore, I offer you my city, my heart and my hope.
Barnes!
Barnes!
-Barnes! -Eagle's down!
Repeat, Eagle's down!
Got a GSW. Repeat, GSW.
-Get him out of here! -Move! Move!
Move him! Go! Go, go, go!
Pick him up! One, two, three.
You got him?
Find that shooter.
Control, I want a perimeter set a half block out.
Sweep the buildings along the back annex.
No one goes in or out without our go.
-Okay, you got him? -Veronica!
-Control. -Do something!
Come in, Control! I need a 20 on POTUS.
Control. Come in, Control. Damn it!
-Listen to me! -I said back up! Hey, shut up!
Listen! We are in danger. We gotta get out of here!
Now, get up! I said get up!
-Let me have him. -Let me go.
Barnes.
Why'd you run for the president? Why did you run for the president?
-Barnes, we're handling this. -I hear bang.
-I protect the mayor. It's my job! -You got there pretty fast.
-Barnes, he's a cop. -I don't care, he knows something!
Get him out of here! Get him out.
Don't release him!
I've been set up! You got the wrong person!
Control. Control, come in.
There's no response from Control.
I just spoke with them. POTUS is secure.
Till we find that shooter, we're shutting the city down.
This never should've happened.
Except that it did. And it happened on our watch.
I can't live with that.
We gotta find him.
-Sir, we need your camera. -Sure.
-Where's the zoom? -It's that right here.
Right there. That's where the flutter was.
But the shot was up and to the left.
Wait, you saw the shooter?
No. But I saw something. Like a flash of light.
-I saw a man in that room, sir. -I'll check it out.
-I'm coming with you. -No! No.
If you're wrong, let me take the heat.
Sir, did you film this entire thing?
-Yes. -Show me.
I think I got the shooter on tape.
Wait, go forward.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! There's a bomb at the podium!
There's a bomb at the podium!
Everybody get down!
This never should've happened.
Find that shooter.
Flash of light.
Find that shooter.
He just walked. He just walked.
Medic! We need a medic here!
Barnes.
We're gonna get you some help, buddy.
Barnes? Barnes.
Anna?
Hey! Hey, stop him! Stop him!
Stop! Stop!
Hey, freeze!
Secret Service. I need to see your tapes.
Yeah. Kevin.
I need to see any footage you have of the back part of the plaza.
-We need footage of the plaza. -How much do you need?
Just give me everything.
Can you hear me? Camera three, can you hear me?
Just play it back from there. Yeah.
-Barnes, you were right. -About what?
About the shooter. I'm in pursuit, leaving the back annex, heading west.
Repeat, heading west.
-Did you call it in? -No. No, I need you to.
-I got it. Go. -Camera seven.
Camera seven. This is Grace, can you hear me?
-Camera seven, can you hear me? -Control? Come in, Control.
Control, come in.
-I need you to tell us-- -Damn it.
Okay. We need you to tell us where you are.
This is Agent Barnes. Control is down. My partner is in pursuit of a suspect.
We need immediate assistance just outside the back annex.
Grace, they have a suspect.
Headed west on the surface streets.
-West. -Do you copy?
Camera six, if you can hear me, turn around and go west.
Camera six, if you can hear me, turn around and go west.
Backup is on its--
What?
Barnes, what is it?
Rewind that.
Six? Six, did you get all that?
Stop.
Oh, my God.
What? What? What did he see?
Next.
Police, I work for the mayor.
Are you armed?
Are you armed?
Yes.
Okay, I'll turn it off. Go through.
I'll be at the underpass.
You have a glow about you.
It's the heat.
The heat?
What have you been doing?
Nothing.
Taking in the crowd.
Some more than others?
I saw you just now.
-You saw nothing. -It didn't look like nothing.
You don't have to worry about him, I promise.
Enrique.
You're the one that I want, there is no one else.
How many ways do I need to say it?
When you've finished here we'll go away together, just you and me.
I love you.
Did you remember to bring my bag?
Thank you.
-I love you. -I love you.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States:
President Henry Ashton.
Mr. Mayor, this is a great day. It's an honor to be here.
Welcome. Thank you so much for being here.
This is a wondrous day.
Today, we make history.
I'll be at the underpass.
You don't have to worry about him, I promise.
You're the one that I want, there is no one else.
When you've finished here we'll go away together, just you and me.
--my heart and my hope.
Get him out of here!
Let's go, move it! Let's go!
-Get moving! -Let me go! I work for the mayor!
-Shut up and move! -Let me go!
Hey. Who are you?
Let's go. Who are you? Look at me! Look!
Hey! Who are you?
Who are you? Who are you?
Look at me, look at me! Look at me! Answer the goddamn question.
Why did you run?
Answer the question.
Veronica!
-Veronica! Veronica! -Hey, calm down!
We have to go!
We are all in danger!
We have to go! She threw something!
Gun. It's loaded.
-Back up, I said! -Listen! He's telling the truth!
-Listen! -Shut up! Just shut up!
My badge is here.
-Listen. We have to go. -He has a badge.
Calm down! You on duty?
I work for the mayor.
Listen to me! We are in danger!
We gotta get out of here! We have to go!
Why'd you run for the president? Why did you run for the president?
I hear bang. I go to protect the mayor. It's my job.
-You got there pretty fast. -He's a cop.
-I don't care, he knows something! -Get him out of here!
I've been set up! You got the wrong person!
Do not release him!
Medic! We need a medic here!
Holden.
Hey! Stop him! Stop!
Hey! Stop him!
Hey, freeze!
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Freeze! Stop! I said freeze!
Damn it!
Get out the way! Get out the way!
Stop him! Stop him! Someone stop him!
I'll be at the underpass.
Stop!
Get down! Get down!
Move!
Let's go!
Move! Move!
Out the way. Out the way!
Get out of the way! Police!
Out of the way!
Shit.
Out the way!
Surprised to see me alive?
It's amazing.
Hello.
-Hello, how are you? -Okay.
Excuse me.
What are you seeing?
-Speak English. -I try.
I'm just watching all the people up there.
Hi. My name is Sam. Nice to meet you.
Howard Lewis. Nice to meet you too.
-American? -Yeah.
-What brings you here? -Just looking for a little excitement.
-First time, huh? -Europe? Yeah.
Yeah, it just felt like it was the right time. What about you?
I go where the moment takes me.
That must be nice. No family, right?
No.
None that I know of.
Things change when you got kids running around.
Are yours with you?
No, they're with their mother. We're going through a bad patch right now.
I needed to get away for a little while, give us some space.
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry. -It's fine, it's fine.
I think it's my cue.
Yeah. It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too. Best of luck.
Yeah. To you too.
What's your name?
-Hey, tell him your name. -Anna.
That's a pretty name.
You look about the same age as my son, Nathan.
Can I buy her another cone?
-No, no, no, it's okay. Thank you. -No, really, really.
No, no, it's okay.
-Please, Mom? -That's enough, I said no.
Anna?
I'm sorry.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States:
President Henry Ashton.
Welcome. Thank you so much for being here.
This is a wondrous day.
Today we make history.
It is with great pleasure that I invite you all to our humble city.
The hopes of the world are with us.
We must come together...
...on this day...
...in this renowned place...
...to band together for peace.
I don't think he's supposed to be up there. What's he doing?
Therefore, I offer you my city, my heart and my hope.
What's he doing up there?
Get him!
Eagle's down, Eagle's down!
We got a GSW. Repeat, GSW. We gotta leave right now.
Get him out of here! Get him out of here!
Let's go! Move him! Go! Go, go, go!
-One, two, three. -You got him?
-Let me go! -Move!
Shut up! Move it!
-Let me go! -What were you doing up there?
Hey! Answer the goddamn question.
Veronica!
Veronica!
We have to go!
Please! Listen to me! We have to go!
Hey. Step away, sir.
-She threw something. -Gun. It's loaded.
-Hey! Back up, sir! -Listen to me! He's telling the truth.
Veronica. Veronica!
Anna! Anna!
Hi, leave a message.
Pam. It's me.
Probably waking you up, it's just--
You'll see on the news when you wake up that the president's been shot.
He was here in Spain, and I think I just saw the guy who did it.
Look, look. I'm all right, all right?
I just want you to let the kids know that I'm fine...
...and that I love them very much and--
Oh, man. I can't believe what I just saw.
And I think I got it all on tape.
I don't know what to do, but the right--
Sir, we need your camera.
-Sure. -Where's the zoom?
Press this button right there.
Yeah. That's-- That's where the flutter was.
But the shot was up to the left.
-You saw the shooter? -I saw something, like a flash of light.
Right there. There was something in that window right there.
-I saw a man in that room, sir. -I'll go check it out.
-I'm coming with you. -No! No.
If you're wrong, let me take the heat.
-Sir, did you film this entire thing? -Yes, I did.
Show me.
I think I got the shooter on tape.
Wait, go forward.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. There's a bomb at the podium!
Medic! We need a medic here!
Anna?
Anna!
Where's your mother? Where is she?
Everybody evacuate the plaza, okay?
-Come with me. -Okay.
I gotta get you somewhere safe, then we'll find your mother.
Someone stop him!
Hold it!
Are you okay?
Hey! Hey! Get out the way!
Stop him! Get out the way!
Stop him!
Anyone, stop him! Help us! Someone help!
Excuse me. Excuse me. I need your help.
I need you to watch her. Her mother's gone, I don't know where she is.
She'll be safe with me.
I'm gonna be right back. I'm gonna be right back.
I've got to help the police.
Just stay with this lady and I'll be back. I promise.
I'll be right back, okay?
I'll be right back.
Don't worry, we'll find your mom, don't cry.
Stop! Get out the way.
Hold it! Stop!
Stop! Freeze!
Out of the way! Freeze! Stop him!
Move! Move, move, move!
Move! Quick!
Turn left, I got right!
Move!
He's a cop.
He's a cop.
Freeze!
He shot him. He shot him.
Anna. Anna.
Anna!
Anna!
When do we think the changes will be ready?
It's not like I have to make a speech now.
I could just wing it. How much trouble could I really get myself into?
Thanks. Nice to know we both know my limitations.
-We're stopping? -Yes, sir.
Rick, I'll call you back.
The NSA's just confirmed the threat.
-Control, handoff complete. -Roger, point man.
Where's Phil?
The hotel. He's on with the Joint Chiefs.
He's sending the double, isn't he?
Yeah.
We're moving POTUS to the hotel.
Control, we've N.D.'d the car. POTUS is returning.
We issue a statement that we're deferring to Prime Minister Gutierrez--
Deferring, that's great.
Control, ETA to castle is two minutes.
Today of all days.
Christ.
Sir, we've used doubles since Reagan.
That was for photo ops. Not for anything this big.
Control, we have POTUS and we are moving to the castle.
Eagle has arrived at the plaza.
Control, we have POTUS and are entering the castle.
-Sir. -Talk to me, Phil.
NSA called it five minutes ago. It's real.
And the summit? You're not thinking of pulling out entirely?
Why would we?
Do we know who's behind this?
A local group with a vague connection to the Mujahedin Brigade.
-Why issue the threat now? -U.S. Special Forces...
...uncovered a plot to smuggle a bomb out of Morocco.
We took their bomb and their men, and this may be their retaliation.
You think trying to kill me is a retaliation.
POTUS is moving.
Safe for Eagle to exit vehicle.
Copy that.
This is them?
That's Benwar Suarez. As near as we can tell, he leads the group.
And what do we know about him?
He's from Morocco, educated in Paris.
He went off the map for a while, but he surfaced in Beirut, Darfur.
Couple days ago we intercepted an e-mail between members of his group.
Embedded in it were links to maps, blueprints of the area.
It was this morning that we received the threat.
The Joint Chiefs, what do they recommend?
That we go after their leadership.
Here in Spain?
Morocco.
We have a satellite lock on one of their camps there.
You want me to call in a strike on a friendly Arab nation?
They're harboring terrorists.
-And this intel, we're certain--? -Absolutely.
Control, we're clear on seven.
Why not focus on the ones who are here actually doing this?
This summit is too important.
But we're looking for five people out of 6 million. We are trying.
Try harder.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States:
President Henry Ashton.
A wonderful day. Some words now.
Welcome.
This is a wondrous day.
Today, we make history.
-He doesn't even look like me. -Señor Presidente...
...fellow members of the European Union...
...President Ashton...
...and citizens of the world...
...it is with great pleasure that I invite you all to our humble city.
Is that Thomas?
Yes, sir.
I thought he was still inactive.
He was.
Well, if he's back, why isn't he with me?
We weren't sure if he was ready.
-You sent him out there. -We need someone to sell the double.
Sell? He took a bullet for me, Phil.
And look at him.
He hasn't stopped punishing himself since.
I liked him every bit as much as you did.
But we needed to know we could count on him again.
So you threw him out there to see if he could?
That's how we treat our friends now?
Therefore...
...I offer you my city, my heart and my hope.
This summit could very well be the defining moment of his presidency.
Jesus!
The president appears to have been shot.
I heard two shots, and the president fell.
Get the Joint Chiefs on the line now.
Admiral Houston, it's McCullough. Have you seen the situation?
The president is secure.
Get him out of here!
How long do we have to get the birds in the air?
So you're ready to strike now?
Mr. President.
Sir.
Mr. President.
The Chiefs have a satellite lock on their village. They're ready.
Sir?
Ted?
-There's an issue of when we can go. -We go now.
You can't give the order. You've been shot.
We go now, we risk telling the world that you weren't there.
We weren't there, Ted.
Get the vice president to do it.
No, we are not going near the 25th Amendment.
Tell Rick to work up a story I was shot, but I'm okay.
That's not gonna fly.
If we have to go to some hospital and put on a show, we do it.
-We have to talk-- -I'm done talking!
Christ!
Sir, we gotta go now. We have to attack.
Sir?
Cavic, find out what's going on down there.
Mr. President, please step away from the glass.
-Cavic to Control. -Mr. President.
Tell them to stand down.
Sir, we have to respond!
Bombing a camp in Morocco will blow this summit out of the water.
That is what the people behind this want me to do.
Mr. President, we have to act strong.
No, we have to be strong.
They sent us a warning because they want us to react.
They know our playbook.
They're banking on us doing what we always do. We will hit back.
We have the world's sympathy right now.
Let's honor that. Let's finish what we came here to do.
Okay, copy that.
Everything is being prepared to transport the president.
We need to get the president to Air Force One now.
I'm done hiding. This is the president, is my wife there?
-We have to be better than this. -Sir.
-Yeah, get Air Force One ready.... -Kay, it's me.
No, we're fine here. We're safe.
Good morning, America. It's now 12 noon in Salamanca, Spain.
In a short time, world leaders from over 150 countries...
...meet here in Plaza Mayor....
You like it?
Thank you. All right, then. Let's eat and walk?
Security services are on high alert here in Salamanca.
We go live to our news team on the ground and our reporter Angie Jones.
I am standing inside Plaza Mayor in Salamanca, Spain.
I thought you'd want it for luck.
I want to know he's okay.
This was taken 15 minutes ago.
You would find that we are taking good care of your brother--
What have you done to him?
He's still in one piece.
You should be happy about that.
Do what you're supposed to do and your brother will be fine.
If you fail, then this would be the last thing you have to remember him by--
You look out for yourself.
I'll be at the underpass.
Luis, stick with the protestors. We never see this side of the story.
Are you gonna move or what?
I've got her lecturing me now.
We're here for the conference not the sideshow.
Is everything going to plan?
To the last detail.
And the president?
Are you sure they sent a double?
The beauty of American arrogance...
...is that they cannot imagine a world where they're not a step ahead.
Has the package arrived?
-As we speak. -Perfect.
Javier will be by.
Understood.
Felipe.
You will make us very proud.
Control, we have POTUS and are entering the castle.
Copy that. Eagle has arrived at the plaza.
-Javier. -Yeah.
Are you in position?
-I'm on my way. -Good.
For the moment, the Americans think they've dodged a bullet. Do not be late.
-Don't worry about me. -I won't.
Your brother spoke very highly of your Special Forces training.
Do not disappoint him.
You just make sure my brother will be at the underpass.
How's our boy doing?
Are we go?
Good day.
Good day, sir.
Control, we have an active crossing the lobby.
-Honey, I'm coming up to the room. -He's clear. Area secure.
What are you seeing?
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry. -It's fine, it's fine.
I think it's my cue.
Yeah. It's nice to meet you.
-Best of luck. -All right. To you too.
Señor Presidente...
...fellow members of the European Union...
...our friends from Africa, Middle East...
Let's make ourselves a shooter.
...President Ashton, citizens of the world...
...it is with great pleasure that I invite you all to our humble city.
And it is with a sad heart...
...that we must meet in mourning...
...for those who lost loved ones in the recent bombings.
-That should keep him occupied. -Today, we stand together...
...and what we achieve here will be remembered forever.
-Crowd detail, hostile check. -All clear from above.
-Javier. Are you good to go? -This is Control. Keep us updated.
We must come together on this day...
...in this renowned place...
...to band together for peace.
Therefore...
...I offer you my city, my heart and my hope.
We gotta get Eagle out now.
Eagle's down! Eagle's down!
We got a GSW! Let's go, move it! Move it!
--control of the building along the back--
-Control room cleared. -Do you have the frequency?
Four, one, nine, one, zero.
No one goes in or out without our go.
Control. Come in, Control. I need a 20 on POTUS.
Control. Come in, Control.
-Move it! Go! -Control!
Take care of him.
Let's go.
Control?
Come in, Control.
Control, are you there?
This is Control. We have agents down. I repeat, agents down.
We have a situation at the front requiring immediate backup.
Copy, Control.
Coming to the lobby to assist. ETA, 30 seconds.
Come on, guys. Move, move, move!
What's the status on level seven?
Blue team's clear on seven.
Get Air Force One ready and send a chopper. We can get out of here.
No, we're fine. We're safe.
Get up! Get up!
Multiple casualties. Repeat, multiple casualties.
Hey.
We need your help. Now.
Come on. He's over here. We've done everything we can.
He's got no pulse.
Secret Service.
-I need to see your tapes. -Yeah.
I need to see any footage of the back of the plaza.
We need footage of the back of the plaza.
Again.
Two. Again.
-Washington, this is Agent Barnes. -Go ahead.
Control is down. My partner is in pursuit of a suspect.
We need immediate assistance outside the back annex.
-Give me a heading. -They have a suspect.
Headed west on surface streets. Do you copy?
West, copy that.
Camera six, if you can hear me, turn around and go west.
Backup is on its--
What? Barnes, what is it?
Barnes.
Oh, my God.
-I'm coming with you. -No.
If you're wrong, let me take the heat.
-Barnes, you were right. -About what?
About the shooter. I'm in pursuit, leaving the back annex, heading west.
What?
Barnes, what is it?
Barnes.
Hey!
Secret Service, get out of the car. Get-- Get out of the car.
-Washington. -This is Barnes.
Look, I know how this is gonna sound, but Agent Taylor has gone rogue.
Call the other agents back.
I know I made the call, but there's something else going on.
-Barnes. -Control is compromised.
-All agents are heading west. -Listen to me! Damn it!
Goddamn it!
Let him go.
What are you talking about?
My brother. I've done my part. Now you let him go.
Put the gun down.
Make the call. Or I pull the trigger, and your plan's finished.
Again.
Again.
Go ahead.
Do it.
Do it and your brother is dead.
Can you live with that? Knowing that your brother died because of you?
Javier, listen to me.
He's going to be delivered at the underpass.
Don't mess it up now.
You'll get your brother back.
Nothing....
Nothing had better happen to him.
Nothing will.
Shit.
Washington.
This is Barnes. I've lost Agent Taylor. I need a GPS location on his cellular.
Copy that.
Hold him. Hold him. Thank you, he's gonna be all right.
Veronica.
I'm here.
We did it.
Not yet.
-Yeah. -Barnes, POTUS has been abducted.
Present location unknown. No signal from Taylor's phone.
It's imperative we locate and apprehend Taylor.
Son of a bitch.
He fell down.
Leave him.
It's me.
They bought it.
What about Barnes?
He took the bait. He's pissing in the wind.
He's created a manhunt for a shooter that doesn't exist.
Have you got Javier? We may need him later.
I'm on my way.
I thought he was supposed to be dead.
We need to tie up all of the loose ends.
Who's a loose end?
You are.
Give me the keys!
You're late.
Let's go, let's go!
Relax.
We've pulled it off.
This is Agent Barnes. I've located Taylor.
He's driving a Salamanca police vehicle, registration Sierra-073654.
At present heading south, repeat, south, on Calle de San Pablo.
That looks bad.
We've waited too long for this.
Thank God this double life is almost over.
Just get me to my brother.
Christ. It's Barnes.
Got company.
It's Barnes.
Can you lose him?
I'm working on it.
Come on, come on, come on!
Just relax.
Oh, shit. Shit, shit!
Shit.
Shit!
Have you lost him?
I'm still working on it.
Well, until you do, stay clear of the rendezvous. All right?
No. We're going to the underpass now.
-You heard what he said. -I'm picking up my brother.
Are you out of your mind? I've worked too hard.
Either you're coming with, or I drive myself. You choose.
Shit!
Oh, shit!
Shit! Get him off my ass.
Look out!
Happy?
Just drive.
Where's my brother?
Surprised to see me alive?
-Where's Veronica? -Veronica said--
I don't care. You both tried to kill--
-Where's my brother? -What brother?
Where's my brother?
Looks like we've both been set up.
Anna. Anna.
Come on, let's go!
Where is he?
Where is he?
Back off.
Let's go, let's go! Come on!
I won't ask you again. Where's my brother?
Go to hell.
Freeze!
Give me my brother!
He's dead.
Goddamn you!
You used me.
I trusted you, you son of a bitch.
Who's got POTUS?
You're too late, Tom.
Why the fuck did you do this?
You can't stop us.
You'll never stop it.
This war will never end.
Kent.
Kent. Kent, what have you done?
Kent, who's got the president?
Kent!
Stop him.
Get him under control. Stop him!
Anna!
Anna!
Anna!
No! Don't kill him!
Look out!
Anna!
Anna!
Jesus Christ.
-Anna! Anna! -Oh, my God.
Are you all right?
Oh, my God. Mr. President?
Barnes? Is that you?
Mr. President.
I've got you.
-Can you sit up? -Yeah.
Are you injured?
Yeah.
It's not important.
This is Agent Thomas Barnes.
POTUS is in hand.
I repeat, POTUS is in hand.
We need a pickup seven blocks east of the plaza.
Thank you.
-Thank you. -No problem.
Bye, Anna, bye.
-Hello? -Oh, thank God.
-Howard, are you okay? Are you hurt? -No, I'm--
-Are you sure? Are you okay? -I'm all right.
We were watching the news. We got your message. You're all right?
-Yeah. -Because we were so worried.
-I'm fine. -Are you sure?
The kids have been really concerned about you.
Back off, sir. Back off.
Thank you, Thomas.
You're welcome, sir.
Reports out of Salamanca now suggest...
...that the president is out of intensive care.
His condition is listed as stable.
President Ashton has made a point... ...of reassuring Americans that he's all right...
...of reassuring Americans that he's all right...
...and the summit will continue in the days to come.
Meanwhile, word from Spanish and United States authorities...
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the man who knows what you're gonna do before you do it.
The amazing Frank Cadillac!
Here's to world peace.
Good evening. Welcome to beautiful downtown Las Vegas.
How many people are here from the Orient? Raise your hands.
-[man coughs] -You, sir. Where are you from?
No, wait. Wait. Don't tell me. I'm sensing you must have soul.
You're a Seoul man.
Why don't you share with everyone where you're from?
-Korea. -How about that, folks?
And may I assume that this charming young lady is your daughter?
-She's my wife. -Well, of course she is!
And what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
-What's your name? -Yong Kyunge.
Yong Kyunge. Would you be kind enough to join me up on stage, please?
Are you serious about this guy? This a joke?
Want me to round up some mimes and clowns while we're at it?
[Cris] Yong Kyunge, what if I told you
that that pretty necklace you're wearing has a broken catch,
and on my count of three, will fall into your drink? Wouldn't that be something? Wouldn't that just blow your mind?
Wouldn't that be something? Wouldn't that just blow your mind?
-Yeah. -Yes!
Wouldn't it blow all your minds?
Three, two, one, now.
-Did somebody say "spooky"? -[audience applauding]
[Cris] Wait a minute. Look at your glass. Where'd it go?
Yong Kyunge, why don't you look inside my pocket? Reach in. Dig deep.
Let's have a big hand for Yong Kyunge.
Well, that's magic, folks, and that's why I'm here.
[Cris] You've probably seen a lot of those shows.
Mentalists, magicians, illusionists.
You'd be shocked to know that sometimes, not often, but sometimes, it's the real deal.
not often, but sometimes, it's the real deal.
Masquerading as an act. Hiding behind a few 50-dollar tricks.
Hiding in plain sight.
Because if the magician doesn't do that,
the alternative is impossible for others to live with.
Anyway, Wednesday night at the Back Page doesn't pay very well,
so I gamble.
But I don't play against other people. Only against the house.
So, no mega-jackpots, no long shots.
The idea is to go unnoticed. That way, I can keep coming back.
I'm not a god. I can't see everyone's future.
Only my own. And only within two minutes.
Except for when I saw her. But we'll come back to that.
[Roybal] There's no pattern to this guy. He's all over the map.
Well, he's not counting. Not off the top of a five-deck shoe.
Wait a minute. Isn't that that two-bit magic act over at the Back Page?
-What's his name? -Cadillac.
Yeah, that's Frank Cadillac.
[Roybal] Is he pulling tricks on us? Is that legal?
You can't trick the deck.
[Roybal] I'm telling you, that little prick knows what's coming.
If he's running that good a system, why is he not betting more?
That's gonna be my second question.
Look at that. He's looking right at us.
It's like he can hear us.
-[Roybal] What table was that? -Twenty-seven.
This is Roybal. Give me two men on table 27. I'm coming right down.
[dealer] Place your bets, please.
[Cris] Here's the thing about the future.
Every time you look at it, it changes because you looked at it.
-Hi. -[Cris] And that changes everything else.
[cashier] Nine thousand and seventy.
Empty the drawer. Move.
Drop the gun! Now!
[cashier] Hi.
Nine thousand and seventy.
Drop the gun! Step back!
It's his gun. He was gonna shoot two people!
Step back. We'll settle this right now. Hey!
[Davis] What's he doing?
Secure the doors, elevators, escalators, every way out of this damn place. Now!
[Davis] Freeman, seal off the blackjack tables. Sullivan, link up with Roybal.
We're on the floor. On the floor right now.
Bring up the other cameras.
That way. This way.
He's right next to you. Ten dollar slots, aisle 14.
[Davis] There he is. Behind you. Your left. Turn around!
He's right between you.
He's in the men's room near the gift shop. Gift shop!
Davis, where the hell is he?
Black T-shirt, straw hat. Heading towards the entrance.
Come on, let's go.
Call Vegas PD.
Just stole a silver Charger, tag 585 G4S.
-[Roybal] Drop the gun! Step back. -It's his gun.
He rose to the top of our gambling fraud wish list about two months ago.
What he does has nothing to do with luck. It's definable ability.
Look at him. He knows exactly what to do and not be caught.
Can you explain that to me?
No, I can't explain it, Callie, nor do I have the time.
The Russian Federation has a ten-kiloton nuclear munition unaccounted for.
I understand that.
I'm not sure you do.
We need every agent available beating the street.
That bomb was stolen five weeks ago. We've just been informed of it now.
Which means it could be parked under this truck for all we know.
I need actionable intelligence, not paranormals and bullshit magicians.
With all due respect, sir, this bullshit magician's shown a pattern of advanced awareness
this bullshit magician's shown a pattern of advanced awareness that is statistically impossible.
You let me bring him in, and you'll get what you want.
Five days, Callie. That's it.
Get me the head of casino security.
-You Roybal? -[enunciating] It's Roybal.
Whatever.
-Who are you? -Cavanaugh. Take a walk.
Hey, Roybal, this isn't a pissing contest. Come on.
-What'd you do? You got a new car? -Stole it.
[Irv] Look at this.
Twenty minutes to walk 20 steps.
Well, that's what you get from two packs a day.
Oh, hey, uh... Yeah. -I got you two sandwiches. -Two sandwiches?
-I got you two sandwiches. -Two sandwiches? -Ooh. That's 20 grand. -Come on, take it. I love you.
-Ooh. That's 20 grand. -Come on, take it. I love you.
Oh, jeez.
How can I repay you?
Must be a bitch to park this thing.
[Cavanaugh] Chief Roybal. Special Agent Ferris.
I'm sure Agent Cavanaugh has explained to you
that everything you say is admissible in court
and anything you knowingly admit can be used against you.
Do we understand each other?
-Sure. -Tell me about Cris Johnson.
-I don't know who that is. -How about Frank Cadillac?
You chased him out of your casino tonight. -He stole a car from valet parking. -Yeah, I know Cadillac.
-He stole a car from valet parking. -Yeah, I know Cadillac.
I thought he was cheating us at cards. Next thing I know, he's tackling some guy and waving a gun.
Well, the gun wasn't his. The man he tackled is wanted for two casino killings in Reno.
The man he tackled is wanted for two casino killings in Reno. He's in custody now.
Come on, I want to show you something.
You remember this?
Yeah, I do. We were saying he's looking right at us.
-Hey, how'd you get this? -Well, think carefully.
-Hey, how'd you get this? -Well, think carefully. What were you talking about right when he looked up?
We were saying, if he has a system, why isn't he betting more?
You sure you weren't doing or saying anything else?
I was going down to pick him up, I was reaching for my radio...
And right then? That's when he looked up? Be very specific.
That's what I said. He looked up, really.
So he doesn't have to be there to do it. Once you enter his consciousness, he can pick it up.
Is that to work his system?
Thank you. We're finished.
Done some good here, Mr. Roybal, but none of it is up for discussion.
Done some good here, Mr. Roybal, but none of it is up for discussion. Now, as far as you're concerned, Cris Johnson never existed.
That's gonna be difficult considering 100 cameras saw him at the casino.
Not to worry. Those tapes have been destroyed.
Hey. Is she single?
Cris, you can't keep stealing cars and having people chase you.
Cris, you can't keep stealing cars and having people chase you. That's not a life.
But you got to forget this girl that you keep seeing in your head.
I'm not going anywhere until I meet her.
Well, suppose she don't show up?
She already did, at the diner. Nine minutes after eight.
Well, you got a couple hours. How about a game of pool?
All right, Irv. We'll shoot some pool.
[man] We timed every hand of blackjack.
The longest was 89 seconds, when Johnson pulled a six-card 21.
So we know he can see at least a minute and a half ahead.
I had our techs run a radio frequency spectrum analysis.
Came up dry. He's not receiving any form of electronic help.
At one point, there was a two-minute 16-second delay.
He never bet, just got up and walked away.
Well, maybe 2:16's too long. He can't see that far.
-Narrows our window a little bit, anyway. -[door opening]
Got him. Vegas PD got a LoJack hit on the stolen vehicle.
Okay. Listen, about that girl.
When you looked at the clock, did you happen to see a calendar?
Because it could be ten years from now she gets hungry.
It's got to be soon.
I've never seen further ahead than two minutes. Except for her.
Now, what do you think the reason is for that?
I don't know. Maybe she doesn't scare easy.
Maybe she's the one.
Well, when you get like this, there's no talking to you.
She's almost here.
What happened to the diner?
-Somebody else, a cop. -A cop? Well, then, you got to go.
Hold on. I want to see how much she knows. What she wants from me.
Cris Johnson. Still here, huh?
Where else would I be?
Special Agent Ferris. Next time, steal a car without LoJack.
Can we speak privately?
Um, it's okay, Irv. Uh, go ahead. Thanks.
I'm sure you know why I'm here.
Because you're the man who knows what I'm gonna do before I do it, right?
Oh, the show, right. Right.
Oh, the show, right. Right. I saw you there.
Wonderful. You like magic tricks.
Yeah, yeah, I do like your magic tricks, clairvoyance...
Whatever you're calling it.
Let's talk about something hard.
A stolen nuclear munition is being smuggled into the United States,
or may, in fact, already be here.
I want you to look ahead and tell me where it's gonna be deployed.
[sighs] I think you've got the wrong guy. It's a... magic act.
You gonna stick with that story? 'Cause millions of lives are at risk
and you could, maybe, prevent a major catastrophe.
On a practical note, we're standing in front of a stolen vehicle, and you are wanted for assault involving a weapon at the casino.
[Cris] All right, that was an accident. He had a gun.
[Cris] All right, that was an accident. He had a gun. -He was gonna shoot two people. -Yeah?
How'd you know that?
No good deed goes unpunished, does it?
I can fix your legal problems, buddy, but you've got to step up.
Otherwise, your next magic show is gonna be at Folsom State Prison.
It's ironic, but...
people like you who try to help have been torturing me, in the full sense of the word, since I was three years old.
have been torturing me, in the full sense of the word, since I was three years old.
What did they call it?
Uh... Oh, yeah. Observed play therapy.
Featuring the marathon, 36-hour, can-you-guess-the-next-flash-card game.
So, please, leave me alone...
and let me live some semblance of a normal life.
I'd love to indulge your feelings, but I am dealing with a slightly larger picture right now.
Now, you can exercise your responsibility to help your fellow man,
or I will exercise that responsibility for you.
You're right. I got to go.
He's gone, right?
I missed him by seconds, didn't I?
Excuse me, honey, can you get off my car?
Yeah, thank you. Jeez.
[Smith] Mr. Roybal?
[enunciating] It's Roybal. Can I help you, man?
[Smith] I have a few questions if this is a good time.
Gaming Commission? It's after hours.
Gaming Commission? It's after hours. You guys should be at a strip club, right? Come on.
What can you tell us about Cris Johnson?
I don't know who you're talking about.
Let me rephrase the question.
-[waitress] Here you go, hon. -Thanks.
Excuse me. Hello.
I noticed you were alone, too. Do you mind if I join you?
Actually, I do.
Oh...
Sorry to bother you, but I have a question about the coffee.
The bean they use...
Isn't that something you should probably ask your waitress?
Yes, it is.
Excuse me, do you have a light?
I don't smoke.
-[waitress] Here you go, hon. -Thanks.
Please. Don't.
Hey, Liz.
Did you follow me here, Kendall?
No! No, I just thought we could talk.
We got really nothing to talk about.
And I told you that three weeks ago.
Liz, come on, all right? I-- I had an off day.
Just give me another shot.
It's not gonna happen. Okay? So maybe you should just go.
Do you know how hard it was to find you?
[inhales sharply] I was at your apartment. I tried the Starbucks on Lexington.
I was at the dry cleaner.
All I am asking for is a few minutes of your time
so that we can work things out.
-Okay, Jesus, you are stalking me now. -Don't...
Don't say that, please. [stammers] That's a terrible thing to say -to somebody. -Ugh.
Let go of me, Kendall.
Look, I just-- I thought we could talk, you know, maybe we could take a drive.
Look, I just-- I thought we could talk, you know, maybe we could take a drive. And now you are ruining it.
You're hurting me.
[Cris] Kendall, I think you're having another off day.
-Who the hell are you? -I'm her future.
Really? [chuckles]
Hi, my name's Cris.
You okay, Kendall?
See, the thing is, I feel connected to you. -[grunts] -I don't know the reason why.
-See, now, listen. -All right. I think it's only fair that you pay for the lady's breakfast.
I think it's only fair that you pay for the lady's breakfast. Yeah.
What were you having? Pecan pie is amazing.
-[coins clattering] -[Kendall groans] Excuse me, I can pay for my own breakfast.
And you know what? You two work things out.
You're hurting me.
Kendall, I think you're having another off day.
-Who the hell are you? -I'm her future.
Really? [chuckles]
-Incoming. -[grunts]
-[clatters] -[grunts] -[man] Did you see that? -[groans]
Goddamn it! Kendall!
What? Don't blame me. This is your fault.
Get out of here! Will somebody please call the cops?
I am so sorry. -Are you okay? Let me help you. -[stammers]
-Are you okay? Let me help you. -[stammers] Come on, let's get you cleaned up.
-[groans] -Come on.
[Cris] Oh, yeah, I'm seeing some stars.
Yeah.
[scoffs] I'm Liz.
Cris.
[sighs] You must have a death wish getting involved in that.
Here. Just...
-Okay. -Just...
-Okay. -Just... -[inhales sharply] -Hold it there for a little bit.
-[inhales sharply] -Hold it there for a little bit. -Okay. -Yeah.
It will.
-What will? -Your luck. It's gonna change.
[scoffs] What are you? A leprechaun?
Do leprechauns get punched in the face or have their car stolen?
Your car was stolen?
Yeah. I'm hoping they find it today.
I'm supposed to be in Flagstaff.
Hey, is this-- Is this tooth loose here?
Uh, I don't know. I don't think so.
Hurts.
Maybe I could give you a ride. I'm kind of going that way.
That would really be helpful, Liz. Thank you.
I do have to make a stop, though.
It's okay.
It might take a few hours, so if you're cool with that...
Hey, look, if you're uncomfortable with this, -I'll take the bus. -No, no, no.
-I'll take the bus. -No, no, no. [stammers] It's fine, it's fine. I mean, you're not a psycho.
Right?
Because the first psycho vibe I get, you're out of the car.
-Okay. Yes, ma'am. -[Liz] Okay.
-Deal. -["Así Será" plays]
[sighs] Deal.
It's amazing, isn't it?
I end up in a diner where you are,
and we're both headed in the same direction.
[chuckles] I don't know if I would call it amazing, but...
Destiny. That's what it really is.
Okay, I'm starting to get that psycho vibe.
Oh, no. You don't believe in destiny?
Well, even if it does exist, I don't think I want to know.
I mean, if every move we make is preordained,
then what is the point of that?
I mean, life is supposed to be a surprise.
Isn't it?
It would be nice.
Yeah.
[whispers] Yeah.
So he came in twice a day for a week at exactly nine past eight?
Yeah, he'd stay a few minutes, have a martini, and then he'd go.
'Til today, when he met that lady.
You didn't find anything strange about that?
Not strange enough to call the police.
We got a regular that counts the corn flakes in his bowl because it has to be an even number.
Got any cameras?
-Inside? No. -Outside?
No.
Did you notice what kind of car he was driving? Maybe overhear where they were going?
I don't know what car, but they were headed up to Flagstaff.
I don't know what car, but they were headed up to Flagstaff. -Flagstaff. -That's what they said.
Got another regular, she's always on a diet.
Brings in a scale and her own salad dressing.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
Guy knows we're after him, but he still risks coming here.
-8:09, twice a day. -Doesn't even know if it's day or night.
Just the time. He was waiting for her.
All right, there's a traffic cam over there, a bank, a 7-Eleven across the street.
Just run all the tapes. Maybe we'll get lucky
and catch him in wide.
Your buddy Roybal, the casino chief?
Had his throat cut last night after getting a kneecap shot off.
You're telling me this now? We just talked to him about Johnson.
-Hey, I just found out. -All right.
-Local weapon? -Dead end.
And forensics came up empty. Not a hair, not a fiber.
Somebody wants information.
Now, the next time anything happens relative to Johnson, I want to know right away. I don't care if it's a paper cut.
I want to know right away. I don't care if it's a paper cut.
Okay, boss.
The head of casino security, what did you learn from him?
For a macho guy, he screams like a girl.
But he was questioned by federal agents looking for Cris Johnson.
But he was questioned by federal agents looking for Cris Johnson. -Yes? -He said they haven't found him yet.
-Yes? -He said they haven't found him yet.
Do you believe this shit?
He can see things before they happen?
It makes no difference what I believe.
Look, we spent two years setting this up,
and that man out there is worried all this will be compromised by Johnson.
We're wasting our time looking for some magician.
We're being paid to secure the operation, Jones, not to hunt down some carnival barker.
not to hunt down some carnival barker.
Really? Then why are the same authorities
Really? Then why are the same authorities that are looking for us so interested in him?
Get rid of him.
Do it now.
-[speaks in Havasupai] -Hey.
Havasupai Reservation. I teach here once a week.
The conditions are pretty lousy.
But it's in the Canyon, one of the Eight Wonders of the World.
-Hey, Sam. -Hey, Liz.
Well, a couple hundred years ago, this tribe was booming.
Plenty of food and a thriving culture. They should be better off.
But I guess this was just their destiny.
I'd like to meet their shaman.
I read once that in many North American tribes
their shamans purpose wasn't only healing
but they also claimed to have power over the atmosphere.
-Mm-hmm. -To bring on or stop rain.
Even know future events.
-Mm-hmm. -Do you think that's possible?
Well, I believe anything is possible.
Me, too.
-Whose birthday? -One of my students.
Hey! Hi!
-How's it going? -[children laughing]
Hello! How is everybody? Good?
-That's good. -Oh, I was close.
That was a lot. You messed up on the last part.
On the last part. Yeah. [laughs]
I thought you weren't coming back until next Monday.
Well, I'm not, but it's Jake's birthday. How could I miss that?
Who's that man you're with?
Is he your boyfriend?
No, no, he's not my boyfriend. He's just my friend.
I think he likes you.
Well, why would you say that?
Because he looked at you like my brother looks at his girlfriend.
Hey, Jake, you want to see some magic? I'll show you something. Come here.
I found this rock out in the Canyon and I want you to hold it because it's a magic rock.
and I want you to hold it because it's a magic rock. That's right. Hold it really tight. Keep squeezing.
It's magic.
He won't bite.
Happy birthday.
So, you're a magician?
I have a small magic act back in Vegas.
The Frank Cadillac Show.
-I thought your name was Cris. -It is.
Frank Cadillac is my stage name.
How did you come up with that?
I picked two things I really liked and I put them together.
Frankenstein and Cadillacs.
You are odd.
Charming... but odd.
[man] Cease fire! Visitor on the range!
Nice. A little close, though.
-[gunfire] -[casing clacking] Okay.
You were right about the traffic cam. We got a positive ID.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
It's okay.
Did I drool?
-Drool? -Yeah.
Wha-- Drool? No.
Oh, my God, it's coming down so hard.
-Yeah. -[yawns]
I like rain.
I like rain, too.
You know, once, I think it was in Denmark, it rained fish.
Because the sun dehydrated the water and took it up into the atmosphere,
re-hydrated the fish eggs and they hatched and it rained fish.
-Is that true? -Yeah, in the clouds.
-Is that true? -Yeah, in the clouds. -[laughs] -True story. It happened 50 years ago.
-I just felt like sharing that with you. -[both laugh]
Road's washed out ahead. You can't cross till morning.
Not even then if this keeps up.
You want to spin around and go back about two miles, take your second left. There'll be a motel there called--
take your second left. There'll be a motel there called--
The Cliffhanger. Thanks.
Right.
Him, right?
That's it? [clicks tongue]
That's it? [clicks tongue] There's no front plate. Where's the other side?
[Cavanaugh] I don't have it.
Wha-- What was that on the front window? Go back.
Back, back.
Back. There! Zoom in.
That's a permit. Track it, you'll find her.
I'll light a fire.
Um, Cris, one little problem.
Oh, no, no. No, no, no. I'm gonna sleep in the car.
Okay.
-Here. -Oh.
-Thanks. -Sure.
Hey, did you hear the joke about the Zen master who ordered the hot dog?
No.
He said he'd have one with everything.
-Good night. -Good night.
What do we have?
They're at the Cliffhanger Motel outside Flagstaff.
We found an Arizona DOT foreman who remembered the Land Cruiser.
-Why would he do that? -The road was flooded.
-Why would he do that? -The road was flooded. He was about to suggest a place to stay.
-But Johnson already knew. Right? -Exactly.
Callie. It just got worse.
All right, people, we've got a nuclear alert.
All right, people, we've got a nuclear alert. Code Red, in the Southern California region.
L.A. to San Diego, 95 percent certainty.
Nuclear emergency search teams are on the way, but until they get here,
can somebody please tell me what my agency, the FBI, is doing about it?
Well, sir, tier-one suspects have been interrogated.
Cars and premises have been checked, friends and acquaintances. We've opened up surveillance on tier-two and -three suspects,
but nothing actionable yet.
Is that what we're doing, waiting for something actionable?
There are eight million lives that are precarious at best.
So I say we widen the net to "slightly suspicious" and get some decent intel before this nuke blows up Los Angeles.
and get some decent intel before this nuke blows up Los Angeles.
All right, Callie. What do you propose we do next?
I believe that the urgency of this situation
compels the use of any and all resources to obtain Cris Johnson.
We know where he is. Let my team pick him up.
[in English] He said they're mobilizing.
Standard procedure when security is escalated.
Tell him to wrap it up. They'll lead us straight to Johnson.
-[in English] Okay. [speaks in French] -[phone beeps]
You hungry? There's a coffee shop down the road.
[Cris] I'd rather eat here, if that's okay.
Sure.
-What? -[stammers]
There's an Italian painter named Carlotti,
and, uh, [clears throat] he defined beauty.
He said it was the summation of the parts working together in such a way
that nothing needed to be added, taken away or altered.
That's you.
You're beautiful.
That was incredible.
What was?
This.
Right here gives us a good standoff position
and open view of the front of the motel.
We can run multiple point and area surveillances from this road here, that turn out.
Get a team with a parabolic set right here.
That's fine, but I also want mobile surveillance.
And give me two or three roamers. If he rabbits on us, -I want to be flexible. -[phone rings]
Ferris.
Call the local police in Flagstaff.
Tell them to hold the outside perimeter.
I want that area locked down.
A body turned up in an apartment with a line of sight to my office.
Slit throat, like Roybal.
Somebody's trying to follow us to Johnson.
[whispers] Cris.
Yeah.
Maybe there is such a thing as destiny.
Give it 40 seconds.
So, after two minutes, he just stops seeing what's gonna happen?
I sure as hell hope so.
Elizabeth Cooper?
-Yeah. -Federal Agent Ferris.
Um, what is this about?
I'm gonna need a few minutes of your time.
Yeah, okay.
They're putting her in the car.
-[clattering] -[indistinct chatter and yelling] [Roybal] Drop the gun! Step back.
[Cris] It's his gun. He was gonna shoot two people!
This was three days ago?
He used you to get away from us in Vegas.
You can be pretty sure that everything he told you is a lie.
He's delusional. A sociopath.
[Liz] Oh, my God. [sighing] Oh, my God.
Oh, shit. [sighing] Oh, shit.
[Cavanaugh] Go back to the motel. Have a drink. Put one of these in his glass.
It'll take five minutes to put him to sleep.
Then we'll come in and get him. Nobody's been hurt.
But this is important. You need to do it at least two minutes
after you get him out of the room.
Wha-- [sighs] Why do you need me? Why can't you just get him?
Liz, as I understand it, you work for a federally-funded program
Liz, as I understand it, you work for a federally-funded program teaching on various reservations. Is that true?
Yes, that's true.
Well, I'd think you'd be eager to help us. We're on the same team.
Now they're letting her go.
-Uh, thanks for the note. -Sure.
[sighs] Did you have a nice walk?
I did. You know, it's-- It's really beautiful here. [chuckles]
-I have a present for you. -Oh.
-Oh, thanks. Hey. I need that. -Yeah.
Is something wrong?
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.
Why don't you go wash up, and I'm gonna make us breakfast.
-Okay. -Okay.
Forty-five seconds.
A minute-thirty.
And that's two.
-Looks good. -You think so?
-Thank you. -Mm-hmm.
[sighs] Don't drink that!
[crying] Oh, God, I don't know what I'm doing. I have no idea what I'm doing.
Some federal agent came up to me
and said that you were a delusional sociopath
and showed me this tape. So maybe you are.
But I don't wanna believe that. I don't think I can believe that.
And she also said that if you ran, they would shoot you.
So I should drug you instead and I, uh...
Even if what they said is true, I don't want you to die.
[inhales] I don't want you to die.
[whispering] Cris, is it true?
Oh, shit.
Get me broadband noise reduction. I don't like hearin' this!
Speak quietly and act normally.
How long did they say the drugs would take?
-that left. -About five minutes.
What is he doing?
[Cavanaugh] He's drinking. Give it a minute.
Got a clean shot?
Not yet.
The man in that casino would have killed two people.
It happened. It just hadn't happened yet.
[announcer 2] Forrest Griffin wins by knockout. [whispering] Oh, my God, you are delusional.
"Fluffy cranberry or a stack of chocolate chip pancakes for the kids."
[man on TV 1] Fluffy cranberry
or a stack of chocolate chip pancakes for the kids in an instant.
"Safe? Who knows what's safe?
I knew a man who dropped dead from looking at his wife."
Safe. Who knows what's safe?
-[sighs] -I knew a man dropped dead from looking at his wife.
"You can't get lost in the woods if you never go into the woods."
You can't get lost in the woods if you never go into the woods.
[cartoon character] Boy, you got an answer for everything. -[sighs] -[cartoon skunk] Yep.
"That's right, sir. You're the only person authorized to do so."
Uh, that's right, sir. You are the only person authorized to do so.
How are you doing this?
I have no idea how, but I can.
I was born with it.
[chuckles] Is this some kind of a trick?
You know we don't have time for that.
You said anything was possible.
So, you see things before they happen?
You see the future? My future. What'll affect me, and only two minutes ahead.
My future. What'll affect me, and only two minutes ahead.
Except you. For some reason, I saw you.
I-- For some reason, I saw you far beyond anything I'd ever seen before and I don't know why.
I saw you far beyond anything I'd ever seen before and I don't know why.
What do you mean, you saw me?
You've been-- You've been doing that to me?
That-- That you know what I'm gonna do and what I'm gonna say,
-that you've just been setting me up? -No, I haven't.
I wanted to find you because I needed to know why I was seeing you.
-And-- and because I-- I... [sighs] -[gasps]
It wasn't a setup.
What do they want from you?
They think I can help them in matters of national security.
[whispering] I don't understand. If you can help, then why don't you?
Because I can't.
I can only give 'em a two-minute head start.
And that's if my life is personally involved.
-But with me, you can see further. -Yeah.
But they don't know that.
There's almost ten thousand dollars in this envelope.
They know about you. You need to get away from here.
[Cris] What time do you have?
-9:10. -Set your watch to 9:17.
Read this when I leave and wait exactly 45 seconds
Read this when I leave and wait exactly 45 seconds before you do what it says. I'll take Ferris with me.
before you do what it says. I'll take Ferris with me.
It might be a week or a month,
but if you can wait, I'll find you.
Something's wrong.
Don't do it.
I already have.
Go get him! Alive!
-[JTTF agent 1] Let's go! -[JTTF agent 2 indistinct chatter]
-[speaks in French] -[grunts]
Are you crazy?
[JTTF agent 1] Oh, shit! Come on! [JTTF agent 1] Go! Get the fuck--
[Ferris] Johnson!
You know you're not gonna shoot.
You gonna let me die?
Hey, I need some help! -[Ferris] Let's get him out of here! -[grunting, panting]
-Ferris] Let's get him out of here. -[Cavanaugh grunting] I got him.
You all right? You okay? Open your eyes. Look at me.
No good deed goes unpunished, does it?
-She got him. -Now what?
-[cellphone rings] -[Mr. Smith] You see her?
Smoke?
Thanks for today.
Could've let me die. I appreciate it.
That was a real show of character.
I know I seem like the bad guy in all this,
I know I seem like the bad guy in all this, but in the interests of preserving our freedom,
there are larger issues at play.
What about my freedom?
With freedom comes responsibility.
I... have rights.
This isn't about you. This is about eight million other people.
[panting] If I do what you want, you'll keep me in this chair forever.
There is a nuclear bomb somewhere in Los Angeles.
And every television station in the world will broadcast
And every television station in the world will broadcast the precise details of its detonation.
So, go on push that two minutes as far as you can. And find it.
[male news anchor] We're interrupting your broadcast this afternoon for breaking news out of downtown Los Angeles.
Most of the nation's largest technology corporations oppose this idea
and tech lobbying is blamed for stalling the proposed [distorted] rate structure.
...members of the LAPD bomb squad are staging in that area.
We want to go live now to reporter Lisa Joyner at the scene for the very latest. Lisa.
at the scene for the very latest. Lisa.
Jeff, the standoff began when police received an anonymous phone call
stating that explosives would be detonated at this parking garage
stating that explosives would be detonated at this parking garage at Second and Broadway at six o'clock tonight.
There's no, uh-- They have no idea on a motive.
[Lisa] The, uh, victim, however, -has been identified... -Liz, I'm sorry.
-...as Elizabeth Cooper of Las Vegas. -What?
-Now, earlier in our coverage you... -What did you say?
...saw the LAPD has surrounded the area. They've secured a perimeter.
But now the bomb squad is making their way onto the, uh, [stammers] the deck of this building.
And the men... men that are walking up with black suits on and such...
Oh, my God.
Um... Th-- There's been-- There's been an explosion. -There's been an explosion. Uh... -[panting]
-There's been an explosion. Uh... -[panting]
The-- The victim has been identified as Elizabeth Cooper of Las Vegas.
And, uh, she was, uh, strapped to a, uh, wheelchair.
Sorry?
Approximately ten percent of U.S. workers receive stock options.
Many technology companies give the options away as part of their...
Tell me what just happened.
Yeah, I-- I can't. It won't work like this.
Just get me out of this room, and I'll do what you want.
I beg you, please get me out of this room.
-Let him out! -[panting]
-Callie! Callie, wait up. -What?
Forensics report on Betty Peterson.
The dead girl in the apartment?
Her throat was cut, bled out. Otherwise, nothin' to DNA. The place was immaculate again. How'd it go with Johnson?
The place was immaculate again. How'd it go with Johnson?
Well, something happened, but he's not sharing.
You know, there are traces of potassium iodide.
Some medication Peterson was taking?
-They found an empty pillbox. -No.
-They found an empty pillbox. -No. The only reason to take it is to prevent radiation poisoning.
Oh, hey, wait, wait. Can I get a smoke or something? I need to relax.
Thanks.
Oh, hey, can I get a light?
[pilot] Base, Air One. Base, Air One. I've got visual.
Subject is spotted heading south on 5th Street.
Be advised, subject is turning east onto Broadway.
Stay here. Let me deal with this.
Why are you here?
They killed her.
Two hours from now.
They killed Liz.
Tell me what you saw.
I saw them execute her.
Right there. On the roof.
It hasn't happened yet, and I know who has her.
It's the same people we're after.
There's a reason that they brought you here. They're using Liz as bait.
Ten to one you go out on that roof, they're going to put a bullet in your brain.
I know.
Right now, she's still alive.
She is, you are, we all are. Let's try to keep it that way.
I help you, you help me, all right?
I want a two-mile radius. Every telephone grid, shortwave, cell tower. Shut it down.
What do you want me to do?
Let him shoot you.
[operator] Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Check the number and dial again.
-[mouths] Fuck. -[beeping] [operator] Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
-[whirring] -FBI! Down on your knees!
[Callie] You okay? That looked pretty close.
Sleight of hand.
-You didn't get him. -Not alive. He fired on the chopper.
But it doesn't matter. He couldn't call in the hit.
So as far as they're concerned, you're not here yet.
It buys us time.
Every way I try this, she still ends up dead.
What if you do it earlier?
They have to bring her here in a vehicle, right?
-Looking for a license plate. -Right.
Can you see it?
It helps if you don't speak right now.
California plate number 50KF272.
California tag, five, zero, kilo, foxtrot, two, seven, two.
-Please, where are you taking me? -[speaking in German]
What do you want with me?
Who the hell are you people?
Sitrep, Cavanaugh.
Local SWAT has been deployed
and the regional team just showed to back us up.
All right, listen up. A van carrying Elizabeth Cooper will exit the warehouse
A van carrying Elizabeth Cooper will exit the warehouse
across from Pier 18 compound in approximately five minutes.
Four minutes and 27 seconds.
-Do you mind? -Not anymore. Go ahead.
They've got her wrapped in explosives, wired to a cell phone.
Remote trigger. Another cell phone sets it off. Usually a one-button speed dial.
They'll take this route to the entrance gate.
At that point, Alpha and Bravo will swarm the entrance--
If you could just be quiet and do exactly what I say,
I'll save your life.
We need to stop the vehicle here before they get through the gates.
Alpha and Bravo will hold and contain here.
Sniper teams will initiate on Johnson's call.
On his call. Are we clear?
-All elements shoot to kill any hostiles. -What about intel?
We don't need them. We have him.
All right, everybody! Let's go!
-Go! Let's go! Move! -[gunfire]
-Back up! -[sirens blaring]
Go, go, go!
-[agent] Stop the van. -Not yet. You'll kill her.
-Now. -[gunfire]
[pilot] You're good to go! Now!
Move back! Move back!
Take out the guy on the crane, northeast corner.
-Negative on a visual. -Give me that.
[Cris] Aim for the doorway, eight inches above the guardrail.
On me, let's go!
-[speaks in German] -[gun cocks]
[JTTF sniper] Zed David, Charlie One at entry point.
Turn right.
You're clear.
[pilot] You're good! Go! Go!
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
[pilot] Number 2 loading dock.
Stop.
-No! -[groaning]
Go.
[sniper] This is Charlie One element, moving and clearing, over.
[whispers] Thanks.
There are explosives there, there and there. Stay close.
-Sniper. -Where? -Behind us. -Sniper, six o'clock.
-Behind us. -Sniper, six o'clock.
-Got a visual? -Nobody move! I'll find him.
Catwalk, second level.
Catwalk, six o'clock. Second level.
-Got him. -[gunfire]
-We'll have to clear this deck by deck. -You take this one. I'll do the rest.
Let's sweep and clear.
She's near the engine room.
[Callie] Come on, man. Release the hostage. You can still get out of this.
Don't patronize me.
-How good are you with that gun? -Very.
You're gonna be okay, Liz.
-Back off! -[panting]
I've seen every possible ending here.
None of them are good for you.
I'll take my chances.
One more step, fortune teller, and it definitely won't be good for you.
You have one way out of this.
-That wasn't it. -[grunts]
-[panting] -[Cris] Liz, look at me. It's okay. Look at me. It's over.
It's over.
No, it's not.
The nuclear device was moved. We need to find its exact location.
Now, this registers any significant detonation in the Earth's crust.
Now, this registers any significant detonation in the Earth's crust. Take a look. Tell me what you see.
[Cris] Something's wrong. I...
I made a mistake.
-What? -I made a mistake.
-It's happening. -When?
-It's happening. -When? Now!
I got four teams in place. We're just waiting on the road crew. -All right. -[phone ringing]
-Ferris. -It's me.
I'll do it, but I have conditions.
I want her left out of it.
I'm sure we can work something out.
-Liz? -[moans]
Liz?
[groans] Come back to bed.
I got to go.
Go where?
There's something I have to do. I can't put it off any longer.
Are you coming back?
Yeah.
It may be a week or a month.
But if you can wait, I'll find you.
[Cris] Here's the thing about the future.
Every time you look at it, it changes because you looked at it.
And that changes everything else.
Despite not even knowing how to spell "crony,"
that was the reason why we need to leave the country
with my husband, Jack,
and our very cute daughter, Christine.
Jack, I can't take it anymore!
My bladder's about to burst!
Jack, I really need to pee!
Come on, I really need to go to the restroom!
Please! I have to go!
Come, Ferdie.
Remember, I want to go to Paoay.
Is this really all that's left?
Paoay, Meldie!
Paoay!
Just go.
I'll be back!
Please!
Here, take the kid.
I really need to pee.
-Bilis! -What's that?
Hurry up!
I really need to pee.
Get in line.
Aren't we leaving yet?
Are we in Paoay already?
Hush.
What's this?
How cute! What a cute baby!
Your mom must be cute, too.
What's the matter?
Okay, go to sleep.
Wait a second!
After my broken bones had healed,
I still didn't give up.
There.
Miss, the line ends back there. We got here early,
-and here you are, cutting in line? -Okay, okay.
-Hang on, miss! -No cutting in line!
Who do you think you are?
-To the back! -I know!
Here's my passport, documents,
as well as my pictures.
If you will be happy with someone else
And you will feel heaven with his love
I thought Japan's visa application was the same as Australia's.
I was wrong.
I have a visa!
I'm okay.
-She's fine. Let's go. -I have a visa!
At last, l did it!
But fate was really selfish.
Whenever I get close to achieving my dream of being reunited with my family,
fate pushes me back.
I don't want Christine to grow up without a mother.
-Mister! Mister! My bag! -Huh? What?
-Mister, my bag! -What?
-Just stop the car! My bag! -What?
My bag.
Oh, this?
I can't go any further, ma'am.
There's a roadblock.
Come on, you're letting that stop you?
Unbelievable!
Just when I had everything
back in order,
the coup d'état happened.
Please, don't shoot!
I don't support Cory! I don't like her!
I just want to go to Australia!
Gringo?
-I'm going to Australia. -Sorry, ma'am, we have a problem.
-Huh? -You can't board the plane.
PHILIPPINE PASSPORT
Look.
Get out of my way! I'm going to Australia!
-I'm going to Australia! -Ma'am, you can't!
-I'm going to Australia! -Get out! Get out!
I'm going to Australia! I'm going to Australia!
Believe me.
My passport was shot!
Only you!
Stop emoting! These mosquitoes are feasting on me!
Jack!
That's the last I heard from them.
I was out of money, so I worked as a fish sauce maker
for Don Emong Goloid.
A fish sauce magnate.
That's Don Emong. He owns this factory.
Emong is kind. He likes my "future,"
my present,
and my past.
I know he can pave the way for me to go from Malabon
to Melbourne, Australia.
Georgia!
What's taking you so long?
Hang on, I'll be out in a minute!
Don Emong didn't even get a chance to score.
But the inheritance he left me
was even better than winning the lottery.
The first thing I did was to find my family in Australia.
But it felt like I was playing hide and seek with them.
I was seeking, but getting nowhere.
I couldn't find them.
I went back home with tears in my eyes.
Ma'am, there's a boy!
Yes, I can see! You don't have to say it!
And there's a message!
"I can no longer take care of my child."
"I will leave him in your care."
"P.S. In case his mother comes looking for him,"
"don't give him back."
Where's the rest of the message?
"Because his mother is busy".
On his skin!
"Because his mother is busy."
Who is your mother?
And just like an answered prayer, Val came into my life.
Val, Val, Val.
Innocent Val.
His presence has somehow eased my longing
for my real child.
What's that?
Christine? Christine!
Why are you packing your stuff?
These aren't my clothes, it's yours.
I'm all set.
We are going to the Philippines to see my mother.
I thought you're mad at her? Now, you want a reunion?
is to ruin Daddy's plans of marrying my mother!
Your antagonism stretches far and wide!
You're stressing me out.
Junjun, is there no rice yet?
Almost ready.
Hey, put a shirt on.
Thanks.
Use a spoon!
Could you pass that over?
Junjun, answer the phone.
Val, the phone!
Mom, the phone!
Wait.
I gave the order but I'm the one doing it? You?
Get the phone!
You do it!
You're the nearest to the phone and the youngest in here!
Huh?
-Who was that? -Huh?
That was Christine, your daughter.
What?
Why didn't you tell me?
That was Christine?
Christine, my child!
Christine!
Come on, Val! Why didn't you tell me?
-I've been waiting for her… -I couldn't understand her!
I can't understand why you didn't tell me!
I can't breathe.
-Mom? -Hang in there!
-It's been so long… -Mom, wait!
-The phone, why… -Junjun!
It's an epileptic fit! Put a spoon in her mouth!
A spoon?
-Now, try a fork! Go! -A fork? Okay, here!
This is for you, ma'am! Hang on, I'll get a ladle!
-Junjun, the ladle! -Stop it!
-What's the matter? -I don't have epilepsy!
The reason I can't breathe is because of that light!
Who put that there?
-You! -You did!
I did?
Okay.
What did she say?
Val…
Why didn't you tell me that Christine was on the phone?
What did she say?
Well, she was in a hurry. She said she's coming here.
My daughter's coming here?
Christine is coming.
My daughter is coming.
Let's hurry up.
I want my daughter's homecoming to be extraordinary.
You're amazing, Georgia!
Our town feast is next week, but you're celebrating in advance!
Of course! This is for my daughter!
Hurry up and put those inside.
Hey, Junjun! Why are you dressed like that?
I never agreed to this! Why did you force me into this?
Can't I be the Singkil princess instead?
You want that? Fine! You can carry their bamboo sticks.
-I'm okay here, never mind. -All right, let's go!
We're already running late.
My daughter will be here soon!
Come here!
Stay where you are!
I demand two helicopters, five million pesos,
and a visa to Australia!
Don't you know how hard it is to get an Australian visa?
Don't hurt my mother! Please don't hurt her!
-Take it easy, I'm coming to you. -Georgia!
Val, hurry!
Her flight number is PR 432! Wait for someone who looks just like me!
-Junjun, go now. -She looks just like me!
Calm down..
Go ahead, Junjun.
Why don't you give me a hand?
You can handle it. Your arms are so big.
It'd be a shame if you don't use them, right?
How do you plan to make your mother look bad
in the eyes of your dad?
Uh. Uh, uh, uh. Uh ha ha.
-There she is! -Hi, Christine!
You're not Christine?
Ma'am Georgia said she looks just like her!
You're supposed to pick me up!
You're Christine? Daughter of Georgia Quizon?
Really?
I see! She takes after her father!
And where's our ride?
-Who's that on top of the billboard? -My God!
Don't mind that.
Look at the girl on the billboard, her armpits are hideous!
Tell them to get my helicopter!
-Mister, let's go. -Come on!
Please, get down from there!
Tell them also.
-What you're doing is dangerous! -Move away!
Come on!
-Val? -Mom's up there!
Surrender peacefully!
-Mom! -And release Georgia Quizon!
What is she doing up there?
Idiot! Can't you see she's being held hostage?
Hang in there! I'm going to rescue you!
Oh, really?
Do it, then!
Never mind, I'll just pray for you!
-You jerk! -Give me that!
Ma'am, we're here!
We're here with your daughter!
Here she is!
You lied to us!
You said you two looked alike, but this girl's gorgeous!
My child!
Let her go.
-Mister Hostage? -Yes?
I haven't seen my daughter for twenty years.
Her father took her away from me.
He took her to Australia.
My whole life…
All I ever dreamed of
was to hug and kiss her.
How would I do that,
if you kill me now?
Christine?
This is my daughter! My daughter…
Meet my daughter!
So, do you want to eat?
Here.
There's more food inside. Let's go!
This will be your home.
I'm really sorry about the food.
I didn't have much time to prepare.
Do you want fruit? We have some star apple.
There's papaya.
We have Malabon fried noodles.
Malabon roasted pig.
Malabon rice cakes.
-Malabon mangoes. -It stinks.
There's also Malabon melons. Malabon bananas.
-Malabon, Malabon. -Malabon fish sauce.
-Fish sauce? -Malabon candy.
Don't worry, dear,
I'll have the entire house air-conditioned by tomorrow.
-I agree. -Excuse me, dear.
I already called Meralco yesterday.
They said they'll install more lampposts soon.
That should brighten the house.
Do you have a strong water supply?
It's even stronger than your attitude.
And because we're in Malabon,
flood water comes inside the house uninvited.
Wait, who's this?
Is this the koala bear you brought me?
Nanny?
You're just her maid, yet you act like some special guest?
Ma'am, where do we put their luggage?
Just put them in Christine's room.
Excuse me.
I'll ask them to prepare the roasted pig so you can eat.
Let's start from here.
This should tell us if my mom is some kind of pagan or Antichrist.
A war freak, a drunkard, and a gambler!
We were all shocked when he got back from Japan,
looking like a woman!
You mean, she's a menace to society?
And if she's a transvestite from Japan,
then Georgia must be…
Georgia who? I'm talking about Georgie!
-Georgie? -Georgie?
No, we're talking about Georgia. Georgia Quizon!
Oh, you mean Ma'am Georgia?
-Yes! -That woman is an angel on earth.
She actually funded half of the church's construction.
She comes to mass every day.
A true follower of God.
Is it true that Georgia is stingy?
If I find out who's spreading those rumors about Georgia,
I'll chop him into pieces!
Okay, okay! If she's not stingy,
then maybe she's a hustler, an alcoholic, or a swindler?
Or perhaps she's paying you to say good things about her?
Get out of here!
I'll have you know,
Georgia is a very good friend and customer!
My child was able to finish high school
because of her patronage of my products!
Compassionate.
Generous.
Humble.
We're asking you to describe a person, not a saint.
But she really is a kind person and a virtuous neighbor!
We wouldn't dare make up stories about her!
Or dig up her past with Don Emong!
Oh, about that…
Because of Don Emong's kindness and Georgia's perseverance,
she inherited the fish sauce factory.
Let's go.
Don Emong, Don Emong, Don Emong.
CHRISTINE'S FISH SAUCE
It hurts! Let's take a break!
It stings!
I'm sure it stings. This is our third round.
But let's push our limits. I know you can do more.
But it really hurts! Let's stop for a while.
You want to stop now that we finally have the time?
Just a few more rounds and you'll feel better.
Just a second. Let me catch my breath.
-Let's take a break! -Come on.
But I'm all fired up and ready to go.
And keep it down! If my daughter gets home,
-we might not finish this. -Okay, let's go!
-Okay, I'm going in. -Do it!
Start counting.
-One. Two. Three! -One. Two. Three!
You nasty boy!
It's all over my face!
It's slimy!
Me?
Is Georgia there?
Do you and Georgia have a relationship?
-No. But I wish we did. -She's not your sugar mama?
She's sweet.
But she's not my sugar mama! I love her.
Junjun, where's Georgia?
Delfin, It's late! Go home!
Stop bothering Ma'am Georgia.
Damn it.
You know, if she lived here,
I would be so happy.
She'll have a hard time adjusting.
You may be her mother,
-but she didn't grow up with you. -Am I asking for your opinion?
Why are you so sour towards Christine?
That's not true. I'm only telling the truth.
And I know my place, Mom.
I'm just a nobody!
Oh, please!
Someone's jealous!
-Stop being so jealous! -Mom!
Stop being so dramatic!
Fine.
You really are…
Look at this. Your mother is such a flirt!
I knew there's something going on between them.
I should…
Wait, just me?
You're staying behind?
Just admit you're doing that because you're in love with that gay guy.
Val, have you seen the other bottle caps?
Can't you see I'm in the middle of something here?
Now, where was I?
You're just in time! I'm starving. What's that?
Don't you mean breakfast?
It's only 10 a.m. and you're bringing me lunch?
Fish again? Can't you see we're surrounded by fish here?
I don't want fish! I want meat!
Miss Nanu, Miss Nanu! Is Christine awake already?
I'd be happy to give her a tour.
I bet you want to court her!
Hey!
For your information, Val is popular here in Malabon.
Girls and gays are willing to risk their lives
just to go on a date with him.
If Christine agrees to date you, she may as well die of hunger!
Don't you know that Christine has a lot of suitors in Australia?
Do you know Mel Gibson?
Mel Gibson?
-He courted Christine? -No…
But the rich nephew of Mel Gibson's laundrywoman did.
And not only that.
There's another Aussie who courted her.
Aussie, who?
Michael Jackman, who owns a lot of kangaroos!
Well, there's a lot of kangaroos in Australia.
Yes, but even the kangaroos are courting Christine.
And mind you, these kangaroos are rich because they're heirs.
Most of all, they don't eat fish sauce!
You don't really eat fish sauce. It's a condiment.
Now, what can you say about Christine's rich suitors?
Amazing, amazing, amazing!
Val, go sell some fish sauce and buy a plane ticket to Australia
so you can buy some kangaroos!
Christine!
You want to eat? I prepared these myself.
Your mom went to the market.
So, she asked me to prepare some food for you.
Don't bother. I'll eat whenever I want to.
Besides, I can only eat if you're not around.
Could you stop speaking English? It's disgusting!
As disgusting as the things you do with my mother.
Wait a second. What did you say?
I don't understand you.
Hey, Val!
-How are you? -Leave me alone, Jojo!
Have you gotten to first base with--
No!
That girl's temper is incredible.
-What's wrong? -This is me we're talking about!
You know every girl in town drools over me.
-Yes! Every girl in this factory! -Don't interrupt!
Whatever they are, they're all after my body!
-You have a nice body. -Right!
But I really can't understand this girl!
Here.
Let's pretend you're a girl.
Let's pretend you're Christine.
Then suddenly…
I pass by with these big guns!
Look at these muscles, Jo!
I, myself, am obsessed with my own body!
-They're so big. -Aren't they?
Then suddenly, I grab you.
What will you do?
Val?
-Jo? -Val…
Sorry, dude!
What the hell, man? You soaked me in fish sauce!
THIS IS CENSORED
My child…
I never thought I'd see you again.
For 20 years, your father deprived me of you.
I kept wondering
what you would look like if you got your father's eyes,
and the shape of my face.
You still look like an angel.
Just like the last time I saw you.
Hey!
Hey! Why are you scaring me?
I'm not scaring you!
And why are you entering our room without permission?
Have you forgotten that this is my house?
Oh, yeah? I don't know what you're planning for Christine.
But I hope you stop ruining her life.
She belongs to me and Jack.
Oh, yes. Jack.
All it took was one night. His seed was strong,
in need of a fertile soil.
But the way I see it,
you're like a diner who's open for anyone hungry for a meal.
How can I prove that you're indeed the legal and faithful wife?
You lunatic! You're not Jack's wife.
You're just a nanny. It sounds fancier, but you're still his maid!
You were once his nanny too, right?
But he still loved me!
Come here!
I hate you to the max!
Dinner roll!
Steamed bun!
Flat bread!
Hey, will you keep it down?
Delfin, what's going on here?
Let's play, Georgia.
But why are you playing here in front of my house?
If it was up to me, I'd play inside your house
-so I could see you. -My goodness.
All of you, go away!
You might wake my daughter up!
Why are you driving them away?
But my dear, their noise might disturb your sleep.
Is that so?
Me, too!
Hang on.
Hey, come back here!
Let's go!
After breakfast, we'll have lunch.
And if you're still hungry by then, we'll have some snacks.
And after that, we'll have dinner.
Are you planning to open a meat shop and turn your daughter into a pig?
I just want to feed her good food!
Do you want a part two of last night?
Actually, I don't!
Come here, you!
There…
You want anything else?
Would you prefer comics or killer?
You wanted serial, right? Serial comics or serial killers?
Baloney!
You really shouldn't meddle in family discussions.
How rude!
Val!
You shouldn't talk like that,
because I can't understand it!
Me too.
I think you should eat these yourself,
before you get constipated.
Hey, Val! What's a boy toy?
Bro, why are you in such a bad mood?
My mom's daughter is getting on my nerves!
-I need a drink! -Bro, that's enough!
-Stay out of my business, Jojo! -Bro, she's just a girl!
-She's just a girl. -Hey, take our picture!
Come on!
Take our picture!
You two better patch things up.
Val? Christine? Please?
Let's forget about it. Please?
Come on, Val!
Ew! It stinks!
I'll do it, Auntie!
-I'll take your picture. -Okay.
-Ouch! Watch it! -I'm sorry, Auntie.
This fish sauce factory is actually my tribute for you.
-Okay, smile! -Why?
Did I smell like this when I was a baby?
-Kind of. -Okay, pose!
Okay.
I believe in the saying,
"There's not a bland stew with salty fish sauce!"
She's really good at this.
Can I choose red instead?
Hang on, your questions are so lame!
Try this, Mom.
Oh, I know that.
See? My mom's so smart! She speaks better English than you!
-I have an answer too, Mom. -What is it?
Jack Outback.
I can't stand the stench in here.
What's her problem?
Don't worry, Australians are like that.
Besides, it does smell awful in here. Ew!
Oh, come on!
I know you're just tired!
What you're doing is even more tiring.
We have something to do.
I'll take all your stress away.
No, thanks.
Please don't!
I don't want to!
I don't want to!
That's it! Right there!
You know, you're okay.
-To be your wife? -No, to be a manicurist.
Be gentle, darling.
That's it!
You never told me you enjoy the nightlife, Christine!
Don't worry, Malabon's nightlife is amazing!
This is the bar I was talking about.
Look, ma'am!
What's that?
Junjun!
Son of a-- This is a gay bar!
You think we're gay?
Well, you asked me for a bar. This is the bar I know!
But I heard they have handsome macho dancers in this place.
Why didn't you say so? Come on, Christine.
Great!
Here they come!
Ma'am, that's the one I was telling you about!
Ma'am, that's him! He's the star of the show!
See? I told you they're exotic.
I should have followed Madam Rosa's advice.
"Don't go in the dark or insects will bite you."
Those dancers all look like mosquitoes!
Let's go!
I want to get Mom drunk.
They say that a person's true colors come out
when they're drunk.
I thought so, too.
But my dear, I don't drink.
I might get drunk.
It's not that strong.
Christine, stop filming your mom.
Stop her.
Mind your own business.
-Mom, enough. -Why are you stopping her?
She's just having fun.
Is she? Or are you just making fun of her?
Your face may be pretty but your attitude stinks!
You're only reacting that way
because you can't stand seeing her dance with another man!
Maybe you really are lovers!
Val.
-Mom! -Auntie!
-I can't believe this! -Georgia!
Wait, I'm getting off first.
Thanks, Delfin. We can handle this.
Take care.
-Christine? -Val, you take care of Ma'am Georgia.
I'm really sorry.
Mom, what are you saying?
She got you drunk. Now, you're apologizing to her?
Val…
Give us a moment to talk, please.
Go.
Get off!
Christine?
Mommy's really sorry.
Because…
Because I don't know where to start.
Because I don't know
how to hold you,
how to talk to you,
and how to make you understand.
But now that you're here,
I just want one thing.
And that is to make you happy.
My dear, it's hard to make up for the 20 years we've been apart.
I feel guilty and ashamed
because no matter how hard I tried,
I always failed.
You don't understand, do you?
Me, too.
I know how you feel.
I love you very much.
I love you very much.
I've waited for you for a long time.
The more I get to know her,
the more I hate her.
She's so melodramatic.
Always crying…
She thinks…
She thinks she can make me cry, too.
Christine? Christine!
Christine? Christine!
Christine!
-Be quiet! -What's wrong with you?
You don't have to reel me in just to get my attention!
You could've just whistled!
-But Nanny, isn't that rude? -You're right.
Wait…
Have you gathered more evidence?
Really? You see, I have this plan that could get us more evidence.
I have one, too!
What?
Ma'am, your daughter.
-Yehey! -I told you, guys.
You want to join us?
You know, Val and I are good at this.
We're champions in this game. Right, son?
Go on, tell them.
And what game would that be?
Playing with fire?
I'm sure they're champions in that game!
Christine?
Ever since you got here with your sewer rat of a nanny,
you've been in a foul mood.
Especially with Val.
Do you think I have a relationship with my foster son?
I wouldn't assume unless I saw a reason to.
Mom…
This girl's brain is as filthy as the gutters!
Yes, my mom has high standards.
And I wouldn't be surprised
if all the matrons in this town line up before me because I'm cute!
Your mom, who happens to be my mom too, isn't like that!
I should soak you in hydrochloric acid to clean that dirty mind of yours!
It's our fault, Val.
We never explained to her the reason why I adopted you.
You see, I'm not Val's real mother.
Val was given to me by his father,
who trades bottles for a living.
I was longing for you back then,
so I treated him as my own.
And he grew up having me as his mother.
Right! Our mother told us that story, too!
Months after Don Emong's death…
Shut up, Delfin! Stop butting in!
You really want to play badminton?
I know a place.
It's fancier and more exciting!
There, we shall find out who's better at this game.
You have fans?
-Rock, paper, scissors! -Rock, paper, scissors!
Losers!
Here we go!
Christine!
-Ma'am! Your daughter! -Christine!
-My child! Wake up! -Christine? Christine!
Help! Help! Christine!
Doc, what happened to my daughter?
Maybe she's just catching up on some sleep.
Perhaps her head got shaken up from her fall!
-This is your fault! -My fault?
Why are you always blaming me?
-If you didn't invite us to play… -This is my daughter!
-we'd be at home watching TV! -So, stop meddling--
That's enough!
-What's the matter? -You're both too loud!
-We're not noisy! You are! -I'm just asking her to explain--
-We always talk like this! -How can we hear each other--
-We're just discussing-- -Stay out of this!
So, leave us alone!
We're not loud! We're not noisy!
-B! -Oh! Watch it!
You really enjoy hurting my daughter!
-It didn't even hit her head! -Oh, it didn't?
-Christine! -Christine! Hello! You're back!
My baby's awake!
Christine?
Oh, no! She has amnesia! I've seen that on TV!
She has amnesia!
What?
Don't you recognize me, dear?
Who am I?
I knew it! She has amnesia!
You startled me!
Ma'am, she has amnesia.
You have to cry. The mothers on TV shows are always crying.
Christine!
My daughter has amnesia!
-Amnesia? -Christine!
Oh, sure!
Who are you calling?
Really?
Why?
I'm going to tell him what you've done to his daughter.
Don't you dare…
tell Jack about what happened
or else,
your blood will mix
with the flood waters
here in Malabon!
What?
You're such a meddler!
Here's what I'll do to you.
I will chop those thighs
and cheeks of yours like ground beef!
So?
Are you going to tell Jack?
You really want to try me?
-I won't tell him! -Okay.
I'm glad we're in agreement.
Have a seat.
Okay, take a deep breath.
And sleep well, okay?
Whatever it is that you're planning, please don't do it!
Remember, you also have a sister.
I don't!
What about a mother? I'm sure you have one!
Will you calm down?
I'm just here because I want to relax.
I'm so stressed out. I want a massage!
I'm more stressed than you! I've been working all day!
Get out of here!
If you don't, I'll call those drunkards outside
and ask them to beat you up!
Why are you pushing me away?
Look.
I'm gay! What are you talking about?
That explains these pictures!
It can be cured!
You think this is just some common cold?
Come here, let's try something to determine if you're really gay.
-What? -Kiss me.
Yuck! You're disgusting!
You're being possessed by the devil!
Perhaps this hole in your daughter's skull
has caused the amnesia.
My God!
My daughter's skull is fractured, doc?
Wait a second, doc.
If my daughter's skull is fractured, she'd be dead already!
Huh?
You have a point. Oh!
Who put this in here?
Sorry, ma'am.
Here is the real x-ray of your daughter.
-I don't see any problem. -My goodness!
You're giving me a heart attack!
If everything looks normal,
then why can't she remember anything?
Maybe it's because of the trauma.
I have to go.
-I still have to do my rounds. -Are you really a doctor?
Christine?
You'll be fine.
I'll do everything I can to make you well again.
Chew, chew, chew.
Good job, dear!
You want some more?
Chew, chew, chew, chew, chew.
Mom…
She only has amnesia.
She didn't lose her arms. Look, here they are!
You're treating her like a baby.
You want her to get well again?
Let me bang her head on the wall.
Stop that!
Why are you always against my decisions?
Christine is missing!
When I woke up, she wasn't by my side.
She has amnesia, right?
Maybe she went out to buy some candy and forgot to come home.
She might've forgotten our address,
or she might have forgotten…
how to breathe!
Chris--
Christine?
Mom?
How did you know I was here?
I just thought you miss the flooding in Malabon
since the weather is quite dry.
So, I figured you went to the seaside.
Don't worry, it would only take three spits from a thug
to cause a flood in our place again.
Christine, do you remember anything now?
No.
If I did, I would've told you already.
You know, you can call me selfish,
but I hope it takes a longer time for you to heal…
because I want to serve you.
I want to make up for the days,
months, and years that we've been apart.
Whether your father comes back to me or not,
I'll be okay because I have you.
I could lose everything I have
but as long as you're with me, I'm happy.
What kind of mother are you?
How could you endure being away from us for so long?
But it wasn't my choice, dear.
Do you know the word unlucky?
That's what happened.
I did everything I could,
but I had some bad luck.
No.
You didn't do everything.
Because if you did,
something would have happened.
Christine!
Hey!
What are you doing here?
-Nothing! -Really?
You're crying, aren't you?
-No, I'm not! -You definitely are!
-Let me see, come on. -I'm not crying!
What is this, saliva?
Well, I've been crying this whole time
Oh, no…
Maybe you've gone mad.
Stop it!
Just go back inside!
Hush now, Christine.
Here, use my hanky.
Sorry, I don't seem to have one right now.
Just use my shirt.
Here.
Thanks.
It's a bit sticky.
There, there.
You know what?
You're just like your mom. You're both crybabies.
Christine?
Your daddy called, we're leaving tomorrow.
what did he say? I don't want to go back to Melbourne!
Gotcha! I knew it!
How did you know we live in Melbourne?
Did I tell you that?
I never said we live in Melbourne!
Who told you that we live in Melbourne?
-Did you read that in the papers? -Nanny, be quiet!
You were pretending to have amnesia!
You were fooling me!
Be quiet! They might hear you!
I raised you,
put you to bed, fed you, and now you're fooling me?
You were pretending this whole time! You should have told me!
I only did that just to get some evidence.
Stop this nonsense!
Your mom is a good person! You've proven that yourself!
Why are you so against your parents getting back together?
Your mother never left you, you were taken away from her.
And if you begin to feel love towards her,
don't stop it!
What's this?
It doesn't suit me, Jo. And it smells!
Jo, it smells bad!
Why do we need to dress up like this?
Well, Christine's always filming us.
We need to look decent in case Jack watches them.
Looks good.
Do I really need to wear these at home?
-Where'd you even get this? -Funeraria La Paz!
From a funeral parlor? A dead guy wore this?
-You want me to beat you up? -It seems like it's been cleaned!
-It seems? -No, trust me, it's clean!
And it looks good on you.
My daughter would definitely be attracted to you!
Enough with the teasing!
Oh, I didn't know you were awake.
Can we go out?
Hang on, I'll go get changed.
You don't have to. Your outfit looks nice.
You too, Val. You look really good.
This is the place!
Friend! We're here!
-What's up? -You know it's been my dream
to look like my daughter so I brought her along!
I want us to look alike, friend!
Oh, that's easy. Just look at your daughter!
Darling, I'm not her daughter. She is! That's Christine!
-This is your daughter? -Yes, she is!
Are you sure?
Yes! You want me to demonstrate how I delivered her?
They will be our stylists.
Hey, guys! This is my daughter!
Really?
-Why, you-- -Mom! Mom!
-That's enough! -You don't believe me?
Hey, make my hair nice huh!
Make him look good too.
My God!
-Looks like they're having fun. -Mom!
-Bye! -Let's go?
Junjun!
I had a great time!
This mall is so huge!
-Don't worry, I'll carry you. -Thank you, darling.
Ouch!
What's wrong?
I got something in my eye.
Can we go someplace else other than the mall?
Come on, everyone! I'm so excited!
Hurry up! Let's go!
It's really fun!
Can I join you?
Hurry up! What's taking you so long?
Let's go!
It's really fun here!
Hey, my daughter's over there!
I'm going with my daughter!
Hurry!
Hey, mister! Mister boatman!
Let's go over there!
Mister boatman! Over there!
What's wrong with you? Let's go that way!
Yehey! It's exciting!
-Nice, isn't it? -Wow!
Mister?
-My dear-- -Where have you been?
-Auntie? -I went for a stroll.
You look sweaty.
Are you okay, Mom?
That's sweat?
Christine, let's go home.
What's on your mind?
Nothing.
-I'm just confused. -About what?
With Mommy.
And us.
You're not supposed to be confused.
Once you get back to Australia,
you'll forget about me.
Wait.
So, does that mean--
We're not meant for each other.
You're heaven.
I'm earth.
You're classy.
I'm a hick.
You're imported.
I'm native.
I hope you can forget those things so I can have a bit of a confidence boost.
You don't seem to lack confidence.
Perhaps in other aspects,
but not with you.
Christine, don't!
What?
Why?
I'm not yet ready for this.
You really gave up that easily?
You can keep it.
I was just kidding!
-Delfin, I'm… -For you.
I'm allergic to flowers.
But these flowers symbolize my love for you.
It will last forever!
Goodness, Delfin, I think you should go.
My daughter might see you.
She might think I'm flirting with a younger man.
And most of all, a badminton instructor.
What's wrong with that? Georgia, I love you very much.
I swear, I will marry you right now in every church there is!
-Georgia! -Delfin, if I were to get married,
it would be with Christine's father.
He's my one and only love.
So, please go home because I still have a lot to do.
Remember this, Georgia.
If I can't have you…
Then what?
Nothing!
Drama king.
Go home, and close the door!
Christine!
Yes?
I know something
But I won't tell you
But if you convince me
I might tell you
What's that?
It's about your mother. She has a secret.
You can finally stop making those videos once you hear about this.
And tell this to your father as soon as possible, okay?
Something bad about my mom?
Something heinous.
Georgia Quizon? You mean, Ma'am Georgia?
What's the problem?
Chief, this is her daughter.
She wants to know if her mother has a record.
Wasn't she imprisoned here back in 1990?
What do you want to know?
She wasn't found guilty of homicide.
Homicide?
My mommy killed someone?
It was Don Emong! The old man she married!
She was married to another man?
Come on, Delfin. Those were old rumors.
Do you have files that prove my mother's imprisonment?
Andres, get the files.
Here they are.
-Here you go. -See?
RICH MAN, KILLED OR COMMITTED SUICIDE?
Your mother's a killer.
You have a lot to learn about the woman you want to reunite with,
You shouldn't get back together because of these reasons.
See?
She killed an old man, whom she married
so she could have his wealth!
What's going on here?
It's Jack!
-Jack? -Yes! Jack!
It's Jack!
He says he's coming here as soon as possible!
-Yehey! -Ma'am!
And that's tomorrow!
-What else did he say? -Oh, yeah?
And he says to make sure you two get to see each other!
Let me talk to him!
And he also says he needs to see you
because he heard a lot of new things about you.
-Oh my god! -Ma'am!
He hung up.
But you'll be seeing him tomorrow!
But you still weren't able to talk to him.
You're right.
But that's okay. I'll cook some food.
We'll cook some food! We'll prepare a feast!
Jack's coming home!
Where is it?
Here it is.
Hey, that's me!
Christine, I'm sorry I took your video camera.
I have something to say to you,
but I'm getting cold feet.
You know what?
I'm already in love with you, ma'am!
Even though I know I'm just a fish sauce maker.
But I hope…
your heart flutters…
because of my good looks! Did I get that right?
-Cover your mouths… -Mom!
before your drool gets mixed with the food.
Mom, listen to me.
But promise me you won't get depressed, shocked,
-hurt, lonely, or tearful! -Wash the veggies and chop them--
Will you stop bugging me? Can't you see I'm busy?
Mom, you have to see this!
I have a lot on my plate right now!
Here, wash this.
Mom, please watch it!
I found out something about your daughter!
I'm really busy right now.
-Don't make me-- -I'll do it!
Mom, just watch it!
-Your daughter is deceiving you! -Val!
Now's not the time for jokes!
Will you stop with all those lies?
If you want to help, then do it.
If you don't, then get out. But first, wash this.
Emong, the first and last guy in my life is coming home.
And that's all thanks to you.
In some silly way, you are the reason
why my family and I will be whole again.
Thank you for your money.
Although there were rumors that I killed you,
I was able to clear my name.
Those rumors weren't really true.
I am forever grateful and indebted to you.
Yes, we were married.
But only in paper.
You weren't even able to experience my charms.
But Emong, if you're listening right now,
thank you very much.
Emong?
Emong, you don't have to say anything.
I get it.
I get scared easily.
Why? You startled me!
Nanny, I need you to come with me to the airport.
But why? They already fetched your father.
-I need to talk to him… -Come on, then!
-before he sees Mommy. -You talk too much.
There he is! Oh, my!
Ma'am Georgia!
Jack's here!
He's here.
Jack!
"I waited so long for your return."
"I'm in a bad mood!"
You again?
So?
-I will kill him! -I don't care.
Come on, let's go inside.
That guy's an addict!
Christine!
-She's not here. -Christine!
Jack?
"IMUS and BALIWAG, too!"
"I am yours?"
I am yours?
See, Mom? That's what I've been wanting to show you!
Made by your wonderful daughter!
Is that the reason why you came home?
So you can prove that I'm a vile woman?
I told you everything, didn't I?
Why won't you believe me?
I never wanted us to be apart.
God knows…
I did everything I could.
But after everything that has happened,
I never blamed anyone.
You asked me…
why I never tried to find a way
to see you again.
You.
And you!
Have you done anything to try and find me?
I'm not selfish, Christine.
You are!
You're the one incapable of love!
You are a good-for-nothing child!
Jack!
"It's your loss."
What are you still doing here?
Get out!
Please tell her to forgive me.
-Have pity, Val! -Have pity?
-You deserve to suffer! -Val--
I did everything to turn you against her.
Why?
Because I thought she left us.
I thought she had no plans of following us to Australia.
I thought she didn't love me.
One of a kind.
My mom is so cute.
Oh, Georgia, forgive me! I fed those lies to your daughter!
Where is she? Tell me!
Let me make things right!
I only did that because I was jealous of your Australian boyfriend.
And because you rejected me!
Forget about it.
My family's gone anyway.
And Delfin, nobody wins Best Actor for overacting!
Go ahead and eat.
Really?
Unbelievable.
You hear that, Val?
Georgia, please forgive your daughter.
She's right!
She asked for our help in asking for your forgiveness!
Forgive her,
so we can ask for some imported chocolates.
Right!
Tiangge!
"Yes, you are a moron!"
Mom!
It was all my fault. I deserve to be punished.
But leave Dad out of it! He loves you very much!
Christine, what I'm about to say isn't scripted.
I wrote this myself.
I love you, Mom!
So, what are you waiting for? You may go now!
You too, Val?
I thought you loved me?
I'm sorry, everyone.
You, go home! Ma'am Georgia is angry.
I'm really sorry.
Go on.
Just come back some other time.
You may go now. I'm sorry…
And who are you?
I am Super Binggo.
So? Why are you here?
I was just wondering…
You see, I've been looking for my mother for 23 years.
But you…
Your daughter's right in front of you!
All you have to do is hug and kiss her!
Why don't you do it?
You're wasting your time.
It's always better when your family's complete.
Wait, you're 23 years old?
I'm only ten.
But you said you've been looking for your mother for 23 years.
Where did the 13 years go?
Overtime!
You're right.
Why didn't I think of that?
Over there!
-Oh, Auntie! -Hello.
Why are you here?
You know I have to go there, right?
-You know my story, right? -Yes.
My daughter's leaving me again.
-Actually, their plane's about to leave. -Really? Okay!
Auntie, wait! You can't go there!
-What? -You can't go in there.
Don't worry, I'm waiving all your mom's debts!
-Okay. Let her in! -Mom, hurry! Hurry!
Hurry up!
Amazing!
Wait for me!
-Junjun! -Georgia, my love!
Mom!
They haven't boarded yet!
Yes, they're here!
Christine!
Ma'am Georgia!
Hey, take our picture!
-Congrats, Mom! -Take a picture of us!
Congratulations.
Say cheese!
Happy birthday to you!
WESLEY: It's my anorexic boss' birthday. (ALL CHATTERING)
This means there's a certain amount of inter-office pressure
to stand around the conference table
eating crappy food and pretending to worship her.
That's so good.
That's so good. Acting for five minutes like Janice doesn't make all our lives miserable
is the hardest work I'll do all day.
My job title is account manager.
I used to be called an account service representative,
but a consultant told us we needed to manage our clients
and not service them.
I have a girlfriend whom I neither manage nor service.
That's my best friend, Barry, fucking her on an IKEA kitchen table
I picked up for a really good price.
I'm finding it hard to care about anything these days.
In fact, the only thing I do care about is the fact that I can't care about anything.
Seriously. It worries me.
My name is Wesley Gibson.
My dad walked out on my mom when I was seven days old.
Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked into my baby blues eyes and asked himself,
"Did I just father the most insignificant asshole of the 21st century?"
Well, if you could get me the consignment to me by the 28th... Yeah.
Do you have the numbers in front of you?
Relax.
If your name had come up, you'd be dead already.
We've had some unexpected losses recently.
We'd like to know
where our competitor is getting his munition.
It's clean.
Meaning?
Meaning it's untraceable.
Your competitor's very smart.
(HIGH-PITCHED WHIRRING) Get down!
Fuck it.
No one leaves the Fraternity, Cross.
CROSS ON PHONE: I have a new perspective on the Fraternity.
Careful.
You don't destroy something that's been around for a thousand years.
It's already destroyed. He broke the code.
I have to stop this.
Really? You know this.
So why don't you face me yourself?
Never send sheep to kill a wolf.
They were just the decoys.
Goodbye, Mr. X.
MR. X: Never send sheep to kill a wolf.
They were just the decoys.
CATHY: Wesley!
What is it?
What do you mean, "What is it"? Listen.
(RUMBLING)
Well, how am I suppose to sleep with all that fucking racket?
When are we gonna move so we don't have to wake up to that shit?
I kind of like it.
WESLEY: It helps to drown out the sound of your annoying, fucking voice.
Now, please, let me sleep.
Have you even thought about our talk?
Yes.
Which one?
Perfect. That's perfect.
Feed Annabelle.
Sorry.
(LAUGHING) Oh, my fucking God.
I hope that's not my billing report sitting on your desk.
Holy shit on an altar, it is.
I want that report on my desk in one hour.
Okay, everybody, we're all gonna stay an extra hour...
WESLEY: Want to hear something sad?
I need an ergonomic keyboard to keep my repetitive stress injury in check.
Just the fact that I repeat something enough that it causes me stress is fucking sad.
Nice job, dude. You seen Barry?
He had to go to the dentist. Again.
Yes! (MOANING)
Barry!
You think they have that morning-after pill here?
That thing works. Crush it up, put it in her omelet,
"Hey, baby, breakfast in bed." You can never be too safe.
Oh, God.
I lost my wallet somewhere.
All this together?
Yes. No, no.
He is the man.
How much is it? Oh. Plus this.
PHARMACIST: $20.42.
(WHISPERING) Watermelon.
Chicks dig it.
Thanks.
See you next time.
PHARMACIST: Have a good night.
I love these energy drinks, man.
I'm almost, like, kind of on an energy drink cleanse,
where I do one for breakfast and then, like, two or three for lunch.
WESLEY: I'm the man? (SCOFFING) Yeah, right, Barry, I'm the man.
In fact, I'm so much the man,
I have a standing prescription for medication to control my anxiety attacks.
God, I wish I had something else to relieve my stress.
Hello, Wesley.
WESLEY: You know, there are people, beautiful people,
you just wish they could see you in a different setting, a different place,
instead of where you are, what you've become.
(WHISPERING) Nicole is so hot.
What?
Boom goes the dynamite.
WESLEY: But most of all, you wish you weren't such a pussy
for wishing for things that will never change.
JANICE: Good God A'mighty, you're over here like it's spring fucking break,
and I still don't have that billing report.
Why do I even keep you around, Wesley?
I'll get it done, Janice.
(SCOFFING) Like I never heard that before. "I'll get it done."
(HEART BEATING) "I'll get it done. I'll get it done, Janice.
"I'll get it done." (INDISTINCT DISTORTED CHATTERING)
Why don't you have anything to say for yourself?
(DISTORTED) I'm sorry.
Well, you're worthless.
I'm the one who's sorry I hired your ass.
WESLEY: You know what the best thing is about the end of the day?
Tomorrow it starts all over again.
Hi. How you doing? Good.
You apologize too much. I'm sorry?
Sorry about that.
I knew your father.
My father left the week I was born, so...
Your father died yesterday on the rooftop of the Metropolitan Building.
Sorry.
Look, the liquor rounds are just over there, so...
Your father was one of the greatest assassins who ever lived.
The man who killed him is behind you.
(HEART BEATING FASTER)
This guy's just shooting up...
Sorry. Sorry.
(ELECTRONIC BARKING)
What... Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What the fuck just happened?
Please! Please! Please drive faster.
Please drive... Please drive faster. Please be quiet.
Please... Please understand that I care about my life!
I don't know what the fuck you did to piss this guy off,
but you're gonna have to let me out and call the cops!
Hey! Hey!
(SIREN WAILING)
What are you doing? Oh, shit! Are you crazy?
Oh, shit!
I think we lost him. I think we lost him.
Could you let me out at the next corner, please?
Shit!
Fuck!
Oh, shit!
He's right there!
Look, I'm an accountant. I'm just an accountant.
Oh, fuck!
He's fucking persistent, you know.
Fuck!
You kick his ass!
Shoot him!
What are you doing? What are you shooting our car for, huh?
Are you crazy? Grab the wheel.
Where are you going?
Get back in here!
Oh, my God!
Oh, damn! I'm sorry.
What? Gun!
Under the seat!
Here.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Look out! Get out!
Look out! Oh, my God!
Shit!
WESLEY: I'm sorry!
OFFICER: Behind you!
Fuck.
Shit. Shit.
Hello.
I don't have any money or...
SLOAN: I thought he'd be
taller.
Taller?
Sir...
Sir, I've been trying to explain to the lady here that I'm an accountant.
I'm an account service representative... I'm an account manager.
And I'm sure that if you call my boss, Janice, she'd fill you in on whatever has gone wrong.
she'd fill you in on whatever has gone wrong.
You can contact her by email or... She'll put you straight.
Shoot the wings off the flies.
I don't know what that means.
Shoot the wings off the flies.
I really think you have me mixed up with somebody else.
On three.
Either you shoot, or I do.
One.
Okay.
Two.
I can't even see them!
Three.
Okay. Okay.
That's impossible.
SLOAN: A lot of things for you weren't possible before today.
What you experienced, Wesley, was not a panic attack.
Your heart was beating in excess of 400 beats per minute,
sending abundant amounts of adrenaline into your bloodstream.
This allows you to see and react faster than normal.
Only a few people in the world can do that.
Your father could do it and you can do it.
With a little work, you can learn to control these attacks.
Stay away from me.
Just stay back from me.
I have a gun, sir. All right?
My name is Sloan.
This is Fox.
And the others you see around you are all very good at killing.
So, if I were you, I'd keep the gun pointed at me.
You don't wanna point it at any of them.
That's better.
You're insane. No.
Insanity is wasting your life as a nothing
when you have the blood of a killer flowing in your veins.
Insanity is being shit on, beat down,
coasting through life in a miserable existence
when you have a caged lion locked inside and a key to release it.
This gun you're holding is an Imanishi 17. It belonged to your father.
He could conduct a symphony orchestra with it.
And you're going to use it to kill the man who shot him down in cold blood.
I can't... The same man who tried to kill you tonight.
Your father was one of us.
A fraternity of assassins. The weapons of fate.
We've transferred all of his assets over to you.
And let me assure you, they are substantial.
It is your long-awaited destiny
to join us.
Back off. Back off.
You don't know anything about me.
Stay away from me. Stay away from me.
You stay away from me?
You stay away from me, please? Will you let me through?
WESLEY: You know when you have a dream and you're half awake,
but it's still in the fringe of your brain?
Then you open your eyes and you're so damn glad it was a dream. (CLANKS)
This was nothing like that.
I'm sorry. Could you just give me one second? Thank you.
Oh, shit.
(SIGHS)
(WHISPERING) Wesley.
What's up with you?
What do you mean?
You're... You're here early.
Is... You seem a little pepped up.
Well, yeah. You all right?
Yeah.
I guess I feel
kind of different.
Whatever. I'm gonna go get some Post-it Notes. Do you want one?
No. Really?
Yeah. Okay.
Jesus H. fucking Popsicle, I still don't have my billing reports,
but you've got time to sit here and Google your ass off.
Well, I know one thing.
You've got your review coming up next week,
and I can't wait to start checking me off some big fucking boxes.
(HEART BEATING) Attitude, poor! Performance, poor!
Management skills, poor!
(SCOFFS) Works well with others. That's a fucking joke. (HEART BEATING FASTER)
What is this bullshit? Who's this prick?
Some loser gets his head blown off at the Metropolitan...
Shut the fuck up!
She has one single iota of tenuous power.
She thinks she can push everyone around.
You don't need this.
(SOFTLY) I understand.
Junior high must have been kind of tough,
but it doesn't give you the right to treat your workers like horseshit, Janice.
I know we laugh at you, Janice.
We all know you keep your stash of jelly donuts in the top drawer of your desk.
But I want you to know
if you weren't such a bitch, we'd feel sorry for you.
I do feel sorry for you.
But as it stands, the way you behave,
I feel I can speak for the entire office
when I tell you
go fuck yourself.
Yeah. That was great, bro. Who's the man?
I'm the man.
That's a bad idea.
Couldn't find your keys, huh?
That could be handy. You going to teach me that?
I might need that.
So, Fox, right? What is that? Is that a call sign?
Is it like Maverick in  Top Gun?
You could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?
(LAUGHING) I'm just kidding.
SLOAN: Peter!
Check the shuttle rotation on this STB. It should be 300 per minute.
This kind of cotton weave, the opposing thread count should be 4,000.
Hey, this is pretty awesome, huh?
Is it a front?
Front for what? I don't know.
Assassinations.
You may think this is a front for something,
all I can tell you is this is a textile mill.
And George... George, go help Peter up there.
Yeah.
This is a textile mill.
And a damn good one.
WESLEY: Yeah, that's cute, but that's bullshit, right?
I mean, all these guys are killers, aren't they?
I think you owe me some answers.
All right. Clearly I don't understand,
All right. Clearly I don't understand, but do you make sweaters or do you kill people?
That's an awful lot of questions over coffee.
Are you sure you're ready for the answers?
Yes, I'm sure.
I can't go back.
Not to my life.
SLOAN: He's all yours.
All right. We're up.
How you doing?
I'm The Repairman.
What do you repair?
A lifetime of bad habits.
Would you do me a favor? Okay.
Just put your arms behind your back. Uh...
I don't know... It's okay.
Just behind your back. Is this okay?
REPAIRMAN: Just relax.
WESLEY: Is this part of it?
REPAIRMAN: There we go.
You going to put a bag over my head? REPAIRMAN: No. There's no need for a bag.
That's not too tight, is it? No, that's nice.
Why did you come here, Wesley?
Well, you brought me here, remember?
(GROANING) What the fuck did you do that...
How many punches did The Repairman throw before he was counting sheep?
Well, I haven't spent a lot of time having my face smashed in before, all right?
Did you spend a lot of time with knives? At breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Fuck.
It was a rhetorical question,  culo.
You interrupt me again, I use the business end.
Here's what you need to know,  puto.
Knives are easy to hide.
They don't jam and they never run out of bullets. (COUGHS)
They come in handy
when you have to do some close contact work.
What the fuck, man?
Come here. Come here. What?
WESLEY: What? BUTCHER: Now, try to cut me.
Try to cut me. Hey!
Just stick me with that... Be careful with that. That's sharp.
Why? Just stick and stick and stick.
Seriously, man, I could hurt you. Hey!
Okay, pussy.
I'm not a pussy. You're a pussy.
No, I'm not a pussy. You're a pussy!
I'm not a pussy. I got a healthy respect for the human condition.
I'm not a pussy! Fuck that, you pussy!
I'm not a pussy! You're a pussy!
I'm not a pussy! Come on, pussy.
Hi. How you doing?
What the fuck?
The fuck!
(HUSHING) Just a moment. Just a moment.
Sorry.
Hello? Hey!
Hey, come back! Hey!
You must drink. Drink. Yeah.
What is this? This is the recovery room.
This bath stimulates white blood cells and speed up the process.
In here, bruises, cuts, breaks heal in hours, not days.
You shitting me? Shh.
What is that? Vodka? Yeah.
Are you Russian? Yeah.
Get up.
This is The Gunsmith.
He knows more about a piece than anybody, and he's gonna teach you how to use one.
Pretty good. How you doing?
You know that Seltzer broke his leg? FOX: Oh, really?
Yeah, in three places.
FOX: How'd he do that? GUNSMITH: Jumped off a building.
So, is he okay? Yeah. It's pretty bad, though.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you guys, that is so realistic.
He's been in recovery for, like, three days now,
and they say they're not even gonna let him out.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Hey, we can't shoot a dead woman! She might be somebody's mom... (GUN FIRES)
You need to know what it's like to put a bullet in a body.
FOX: Why are you here?
You know, I thought I was learning to be some kind of super assassin.
You know, if I wanted to get beat up,
I would have stayed in my cubicle, you know.
Fuck.
FOX: All right, shoot the target.
From there.
You want me shoot through Wilbur? I want you to curve the bullet.
How am I suppose to do that?
It's not a question of how,
it's a question of what.
If no one told you that bullets flew straight
and I gave you a gun and told you to hit the target,
what would you do?
Let your instincts guide you.
How the hell did he do that?
Can you do that? Can you do that? Hello?
Hey, I think that's my old train.
Still is.
Shit! You fucking asshole!
Come on!
Let's go.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, God, I feel... I feel... I feel...
I feel kind of good.
GUNSMITH: He got Rictus. Perfect shot. Impossible angle.
Cross is taking us out one by one.
And Wesley is the only one who can get to him.
Cross gets closer with each hour.
Get back to work.
FOX: See that?
Okay. It's a shuttle.
I want you to try and catch it.
You want me to stick my hand in there?
Yes. I want you to catch it.
You wanna put a gun to my head?
I can just slow things down like with the flies.
You need to learn to control that by yourself.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
This is bullshit! Fuck this!
How's it going today, Wesley?
No. Fuck the loom and fuck The Repairman!
I can shoot the wings off the back of a fly! I'm ready!
You're ready when Fox says you're ready.
Who put her in charge? I did.
Wesley.
People think you use cheese to catch these beauties.
But they go apeshit for peanut butter.
Your father was a big fan of this. Watch. (WATCH BEEPING)
Plastic explosive and peanut butter!
Sorry, Mickey.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Hey. Hey, Russian.
Good for one. Yeah.
Imagine if you had a thousand.
They really fucked you up, didn't they?
What the hell did they do to you?
Throw you in front of a moving train for no reason? (WHISTLING)
Beat the shit out of you?
You know, you can say it, this place is bullshit. It's bullshit, huh?
Bullshit!
Repairman. Five minutes.
Heads up out of the question?
Fuck.
You're a waste of my fucking time! Why are you here?
I don't know, so hit me.
I had a shit life, so why wouldn't I? Why are you here?
I wanna kick your fucking ass!
Tell me what you want me to say.
I don't know! FOX: Why are you here?
Why are you here?
I don't know why I'm here. Why are you here?
Why are you here?
Why are you here?
I don't know who I am.
What did you say? I said...
I said I don't know who I am.
Do you really want to know who you are?
Yeah. It's my room.
No.
This was your father's room.
WESLEY: What happened?
A member of this fraternity went rogue.
Cross.
He started by killing the one man who was better than him.
Your father.
Blindsided him on a rooftop.
Betrayed him.
Everything in this room,
books, weapons, clothes,
belonged to him.
Now they belong to you.
Find a connection in this room, Wesley.
It may be the only way of finding out who you are.
WESLEY: Now I know why I could never care about anything before this.
I was living a lie.
Finally, I have a chance to step into my father's shoes.
Grow a pair. Live the life I was born to live.
I've been pissing it all away like it was another fucking billing report.
I have to train harder.
I have to be as good as my father.
On these shelves, Wesley, are the records of the Fraternity kills,
everything you will need to kill your target.
WESLEY: To kill Cross,
the man who betrayed the Fraternity and murdered my father, I must prepare.
I have to become his student, memorize every move he ever made,
every attack he ever executed.
When he dropped a patient in an airtight room surrounded by Secret Service agents.
When he took out that businessman in the elevator.
His bullets untraceable, of course.
Or how no matter what the weapon or how he eliminated his target,
he was always one chess move ahead.
One move more prepared.
One step quicker.
One shot more precise.
In fact, in all my research, I found that he never missed a target.
Not until me.
Yeah!
First time in your life, Wesley, you're in control.
Shoot the target.
You're crazy.
Welcome to the Fraternity.
SLOAN: We call this the Loom of Fate.
After today, you will never set foot in here again.
Why not?
Because, like an apostle,
your task is not to interpret, but to deliver.
Every culture in history has a secret code,
one you won't find in traditional texts.
A thousand years ago,
a clan of weavers discovered a mystical language hidden in the fabric.
They called themselves the Fraternity.
I'll be honest with you, all I see are threads.
Come here.
Look there.
Do you see that one thread that missed the weave
and lies on top of the others?
Like a mistake? No, it's a code.
If the vertical thread is on top, it's a one.
If it's below, it's a zero.
Binary code?
What does it say?
It's a name.
A target.
Where do the names come from?
Come out of a necessity, Wesley.
A necessity to maintain balance in the world.
They are orders that must be executed,
entrusted to us so that we might forge stability out of chaos.
This one is yours.
I don't...
Look, I thought you brought me here to kill Cross.
You will.
In time.
This is your first assignment.
The loom provides,
I interpret,
you deliver.
You want me to kill Robert Deane Darden?
Not me.
Fate.
FOX: The target will be in the conference room, sitting at the head chair.
There are six windows.
You will shoot through the fifth.
Fifth window.
Now.
WESLEY: What did he do that he deserves to die?
You don't know.
I don't know if he was bad, I don't know if he was evil.
I don't know anything about him.
We get our orders from a loom.
Fate.
And we're suppose to take it on faith that what we're doing is right.
Killing someone we know nothing about,
I don't know if I can do that.
About 20 years ago,
there was this girl.
Her dad was a federal judge,
so she probably had it in her mind that she was gonna follow in his footsteps.
So she's home one Christmas,
and her dad's on this big racketeering case.
The defendants want to get a softer judge.
One they can buy off.
So they hire this guy,
Max Petridge,
get him to pay her father a visit.
And the way he pays people a visit
is to break in
(INAUDIBLE)
and tie up their loved ones,
and force them to watch
while he burns his targets alive.
And then he takes a wire hanger and twists it round
and brands his initials into each one of them so they will never ever forget.
After I was recruited into the Fraternity,
I found out that Max Petridge's name had come up
weeks before the federal judge was killed,
and that a Fraternity member had failed to pull the trigger.
We don't know how far the ripples of our decisions go.
You kill one, and maybe,
save a thousand.
That's the code of the Fraternity.
That's what we believe in, and that's why we do it.
Now!
Cross.
Not yet.
FOX: Your target will be in a black limo.
He always travels the same six blocks of Halsted.
You have three blocks to kill him. (HONKING)
Shit.
I'm sorry.
CATHY: Barry! Could you feed Annabelle?
Barry!
Wesley. Hey, where have you been? I have really missed you, man.
Look at the big man. You fucking asshole! What?
What? You don't show up for weeks,
now you're just gonna stop by and use the bathroom?
You think you're a real big shot now, huh?
No. You know what? You are nothing!
No, you are less than nothing.
You're not even half the man that Barry is.
Barry, he pleases me in ways that you've never even heard of!
Who the hell is she, Wesley? Your new whore?
Is that what it takes now? You're paying for it?
Wesley?
He's the man.
Yeah. You all right?
Yeah. I'm okay. Go sit down. I'm gonna find a car.
Big night. I got to get into recovery.
Shit.
Fuck!
Bull's-eye.
REPAIRMAN: What's he doing here?
Come on. Just stay with us. Come on!
FOX: Pull back his jacket.
REPAIRMAN: Breathe. Breathe, all right?
FOX: It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
A thousand.
REPAIRMAN: Come on!
Come on! FOX: No! No! Stay with us.
GUNSMITH: Open your eyes! Come on.
REPAIRMAN: Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
This bullet is the first traceable bullet he's ever used.
It was made by this man. His name is Pekwarsky.
He works out of what is now a monastery in Eastern Moravia.
This place is where the Fraternity was born.
He's taunting me.
He's sending me a message.
I'm gonna send him one back.
He's trapping you.
Leading you to a place he knows very well.
Look, I know this. I...
This is what you trained me for.
You can't go alone.
I go alone or he doesn't show. He's not stupid.
Look, a member of the Fraternity is dead because of me.
SLOAN: Okay.
Go.
Thank you.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Your next assignment.
Pekwarsky?
WESLEY: Shit.
What are you doing here?
(GUN COCKING) FOX: Lower your gun.
WESLEY: You recognize this?
I pulled this out of my shoulder.
The guy who put it there killed my father.
Now, I know you made it, so tell me where he is.
I did mold this, but I can't be responsible for the people who use them.
I don't give a shit. Tell me where he is.
Look at my finger.
I can try and arrange a meet.
Have you ever thought about doing things differently?
How do you mean?
I don't know.
Being somebody else.
Somebody normal.
No.
Shit.
Out of the way!
Stay.
Hey!
He's on the train.
He's alone.
Thank you.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sit down!
Sir, sit down! Nobody's gonna get hurt.
Sir, sit... Sit down! Sir, sit down!
Get out of the way! Sit down! Stay down! Stay down!
Stay down! It's okay! Sit down!
(WHISPERING) Wesley.
Out of the way! Out of the way!
WESLEY: No, no, no!
Wesley, listen to me.
Shut the fuck up!
You don't get to talk to me.
You don't get to talk to me.
Everything they told you was a lie.
Shut up, you lying piece of shit. You shut the fuck up.
You are my son. (GASPING)
What did you say?
What did you say to me?
Is it true?
Yes.
Why did you make me do this?
Because you are the only person he wouldn't kill.
You knew, God damn it.
You knew the entire time.
Well, his name came up.
So did yours.
No, it was okay. Never mind.
No. No, it was complete shit.
I promised your father I'd bring you back here.
What the fuck?
He said it was the only way you'd believe.
Your father was never more than a camera click away.
That's me.
He was my father.
And I killed him.
To your father, protecting you was worth giving up his life.
Protect me?
He was trying to fucking kill me!
No. He wasn't trying to kill you.
He was trying to rescue you.
PEKWARSKY: When Cross left the Fraternity,
Sloan hunted you down.
Ever since Fox had her teeth in you, he's been trying to separate you from them.
Your father never wanted you in the Fraternity, Wesley.
He wanted a different path for you,
with things that he could never have.
A home.
Peace. No.
He hoped you would find your own way.
Your father got hold of this.
Decipher it yourself.
Sloan began manufacturing targets of his own for profit years ago.
Your father found out about it.
And he was going to do something about it on his own, right?
But Sloan turned everyone against him.
My father's name never even came up, did it?
No. Holding to the code made him a target.
Yes.
No. You want me to run?
I want you to live.
You can have a different life, Wesley.
Like your father wanted for you.
We trained him well.
WESLEY: My father was wrong about one thing.
Everything they told me wasn't a lie.
They taught me how to kill, how to feel no pain,
and most importantly, that every job has a perfect weapon.
Well, I'm the perfect weapon.
And I'm supposed to run?
No, I've been doing that my entire life.
So I say no.
I say kill them all and let fate sort out the mess.
Kill him.
He's here!
BUTCHER: Pussy.
Pussy, pussy.
Pussy, pussy.
Pussy.
Sloan!
My father wasn't a traitor.
This is a kill order.
And it's got Sloan's name on it.
What did you say to me?
It's a name. It's a target.
I don't want this person dead.
Fate does.
(LAUGHS) Fate wanted you dead.
And he couldn't take it.
So he started manufacturing his own targets for his own gains.
And that's when my dad found out and decided to stand against him.
And that's when you sent a man's son
to kill his father.
You're not an assassin of fate, Sloan.
You're just a thug who can bend bullets.
Is that true?
Here is what the truth is.
Your name came up.
Your name came up.
Your name came up.
Your name.
Your name.
Yours.
Everyone in this room.
If I had not done what I did,
you would all be dead.
I saved your lives.
Now look where we are. We are stronger than ever.
Changing the course of history as we see it.
Choosing the targets we select.
We can redistribute power where we see fit.
The wolves rule.
Not the sheep.
Now, if any of you feel the need to follow the code
of the Fraternity to the letter,
I invite you to take your gun,
put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.
That is what Wesley demands.
Otherwise,
shoot this motherfucker
and let us take our Fraternity of Assassins to heights
reserved only for the gods of men.
You choose.
Fuck the code.
Sloan!
Sloan! (HEART BEATING SLOWER)
WESLEY: Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic.
Just like you.
But who am I now?
Account manager?
Assassin?
Or just another tool who was mind-fucked into killing his father?
I am all of these.
And I am none of these.
Who am I now?
This is not me fulfilling my destiny. (PEOPLE CHATTERING)
This is not me following in my father's footsteps.
This is definitely not me saving the world.
Still trying to figure out who you are?
WESLEY: This is not me.
This is just a motherfucking decoy.
Oh, fuck.
This is me taking control.
From Sloan,
from the Fraternity,
from Janice, from billing reports,
from ergonomic keyboards,
from cheating girlfriends and sack-of-shit best friends.
This is me taking back control
You may have encountered some of them already.
You may have bumped into or spoken with some.
Or perhaps you may not have noticed them at all.
Whether you know them or not,
each one of them has their own story.
Their own joys and sorrows.
But they all yearn for one thing.
To give love, to fall in love,
and above all, to be loved.
To find that person
who can give meaning to their life.
Someone to be with through thick and thin.
They will do everything just to find that person
who is meant for them.
They're willing to search anywhere
just to find the one destined for their love.
This is just one of the many stories
about finding happiness
and true love.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Oh, my God…
What's happening to you?
He looked at me!
Who?
The guy on the train.
Have you talked to him already?
No, he just looked.
Don't be so obvious!
You've been eyeing that guy for a month now but--
Are you crazy? You think I'm that cheap?
I'm not like that, Stefi!
And what do you think you're doing?
I can't just approach him and introduce myself--
So, you expect him to make the first move?
But, Stefi, I'm a girl.
He doesn't even know you exist!
Betchay, you better do something about it now!
You won't get anywhere by being demure!
Hello?
What are you looking at?
Oh, no…
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Make way, please.
Where is he?
-I'm really sorry! -Watch it!
Here's a kiss! Bye!
Taxi!
-Excuse me. -Hey! This is our cab, okay?
‎Just an emergency. -Even if it is emergecy, this is our cab! -We don't care!
-Even if it is emergecy, this is our cab! -We don't care!
I'm just dizzy…
-Seriously? -My God…
Thanks! I'm really sorry.
Where to, miss?
Sir?
Do you really know which cab we're following?
Yes, you pointed at it.
But which one? There are three cabs in front of us!
The white one.
But they're all white!
-Which one? -The one on the left…
with yellow stripes.
That's right. Keep following it. Don't let it run too far.
-You want me to go near it? -Please don't! My goodness!
-Just keep tailing it! Not be beside it. -Okay. Relax.
-Hey, I'm driving! Relax! -Okay…
-Okay. Just keep driving. -Relax. ‎-Okay, relax. ‎-Just keep tailing it.
-Mike? -Yes?
May I ask you a question?
Why are you pouring alcohol on your desk?
I ate a sandwich earlier.
It might attract cockroaches.
Mike, there are no cockroaches here.
Well, they don't show up in the morning
because they're sensitive to light.
They usually come out when it's dark.
-Don't you know that? -No.
I don't have a pet cockroach…
so there's no way for me to know that.
By the way, your cousin is waiting for you outside.
Dude, it's just a date, man.
I'm not telling you to get her pregnant.
Jacob, why do you always drag me to these dates?
-I'm just doing this to help you. -Help me? With what?
You know, Uncle Oscar and Auntie Lucille talked to me.
What did they tell you?
They don't mind that you don't have a girlfriend.
They're worried that you don't have a girl at all!
What's wrong if I can't find a girl who's--
Hello!
Come on, are you even looking for one?
Okay, it's not my priority right now.
You see? That's not normal.
It's always a guy's priority to find a woman!
-Just go back to your office. -Dude.
You have to get over that girl.
Who?
Who else but your one and only girlfriend back in college!
What's her name again? Katherine?
The one you love so much, but she left you.
That's not what happened. She just went to the States.
-So, she did leave you! -Yes! I'm leaving now!
What? You stalked him?
I did not stalk him, I just followed him.
-Hi, Betsy! -Hi!
It's not stalking. I just did a bit of research.
Is that the guy from the train?
Well…
Stefi told me to make the first move.
And your idea of a first move is to scare him?
He didn't see me. I was careful.
Whatever.
You know what your problem is? You listen to Stefi too much.
If she's such an expert when it comes to guys,
how come her relationships don't last long?
You're confusing me. When I wasn't doing anything,
you said I was stupid.
Now that I'm trying to be aggressive, you think I'm crazy!
-What do you want-- -Hey! That hurts!
I'm sorry.
Betsy, I haven't met an accountant who's exciting.
Well, he's different.
Betchay, there are a lot of handsome guys out there.
When I go out in Makati, I see a lot of cute guys!
Tell me, where are they? Why are they all hiding from me?
I've had enough, Stefi!
I'm tired of dressing up every Friday and Saturday night…
Excuse me!
You put on makeup, go to a bar and smile,
while you endure the stupidity of guys out there.
You talk as if you go on a lot of dates.
Is this okay?
It suits you. Hey, try this one.
Who's that?
I bet it's your clingy girlfriend again.
What's her problem?
I thought she's supposed to be at work.
Let me see!
Well, she cares.
-Like Care Bears? Hello? -Care Bears?
-You know what? Oops, sorry! -Ouch!
-That hurts, Betsy! -You know, Martin?
There's nothing wrong with what Maritess is doing.
But please tell her…
she doesn't have to be jealous of us!
-Why did you hurt me, Betsy? -Wait a minute.
We're talking about your love life, not mine.
-Excuse me. -Get off my back.
Betchay has no love life except…
for that accountant in her fantasies.
-Correction. -Let's go this way!
He only works in that building.
-It doesn't mean he's an accountant. -Cute.
Okay, if you're so sure about this guy,
why don't you make a move already?
Please answer.
Stefi!
Come on, Betsy!
Let's face it, guys are getting fewer and fewer each day.
And in this day and age,
it shouldn't come as a shock to everyone
that a girl makes the first move.
So, what's your plan?
I don't have one. ‎I'm still waiting for a sign.
A sign?
Yes, a sign.
When the right man comes along, there will be a sign.
That's what I pray for every night.
Lord, give me a sign.
Oh, well, the Lord can't answer you
because he's busy.
-He's out of town. -Yes.
My goodness, Khalil got drunk again.
Dad, what are you doing?
Writing a letter for the newspaper.
Another letter to the editor?
I need to do this, dear.
Take a look at this.
Look. They published the last letter I sent…
without any revisions!
This was about the dumpsite in San Mateo.
But Dad, what does that dumpsite have to do with you?
Elizabeth,
you need to be concerned about the issues in our country.
Just take your mom for example.
She dedicated her life to her countrymen.
It's instinct.
As they say, if you have an instinct,
there's truth to what you're feeling.
Why don't you just ask your girlfriend?
She's cheating on me!
Ever since she started working, she has really changed--
And when she met her boss from New York,
she has changed even more!
Friend Lord…
you've always known what I'm praying for.
Please let me meet the man of my life.
The only one who deserves my love
and who will love me back.
Friend Lord, just give me a sign!
Please let us have any kind of contact tomorrow!
I hope I get to see him!
I'll be honest with you, dude.
I liked your parents better…
before they joined that church group.
Seriously?
Before my parents joined that group,
they wanted to kill each other.
Remember that time when my mom
threw an iron at my dad?
And there was a time my dad pointed a gun at my mom.
Remember?
Exactly.
At least they used to be normal.
Now, dude…
all they do…
is wait for the Rapture.
And look at yourself!
You're starting to be like them!
You look like a missionary who makes Bible deliveries.
How do you expect girls to like you?
Why don't we get some frappé?
-It's too hot today! -All right, let's go!
Hey, aren't you coming?
No, go ahead. I don't drink coffee, anyway.
It might give me anxiety and I might have trouble sleeping.
Go ahead, I'll be fine.
-Fine. -Okay.
Ouch…
Dude, she may be eighteen, but she's one of a kind.
You're such a pervert.
You really want to ruin that girl's life?
You're crazy.
No, dude, she's from Europe.
I was shocked. She seemed to know more than I do.
You want me to set you up with her?
Let's just go.
Hang on, I need to pee. I'll be back, okay?
Mocha, vanilla…
Hey…
Wait…
-I thought you didn't want-- -He's here!
-Who? -The sign! The guy from the train!
The sign…
-Who? -Where is he?
-He might see you. -Where?
Don't worry. I got this.
What would you do?
He's wearing an ID, right? Do you want to know his name?
Okay, go.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hi.
Bye.
You see that girl?
Trust me, she wants your body.
So, did you get his name? What is it?
-Talk, or else I'll dump this on you! -Hey!
Come on, tell me!
Morelos.
Comma. Michael.
His name is Michael Morelos.
-Are you happy now? -Michael Morelos…
Elizabeth.
You know my name?
My thoughts are with you, every second…
-every minute, -every minute,
-every hour of every day. -every hour of every day.
-Betchay. -What's going on with you?
You're being possessed again…
Michael Morelos.
Michael Morelos.
Lord, please. One more sign.
Just one more sign, please.
What is it?
You want to meet Morelos, Michael, right?
Well, guess what?
My God, Estefania! What did you do?
I met his cousin at Slumber Bar and we set up a double date with you!
-What? -Yes, you're going on a date with him!
We're going on a date!
That's great…
We're going on a date!
Hurry up!
They're here!
-Smile… -I think I'm going to faint.
Try doing that and I'm going to leave you.
We're sorry, the traffic was terrible.
Even parking is a hassle.
You know what, it's okay 'cause it's a Friday night.
By the way,
Betsy, this is Jacob.
And this is his cousin…
-What's your name again? -Michael.
Michael Morelos.
I know.
Pardon?
I said, now I know that you're Mr. Morelos.
Morelos, Michael.
Yes!
Okay.
So, what movie are we catching, dudes?
Oh, dudes, you know what?
You decide. You decide on that.
I think I like Haunted Sweethearts.
I like Haunted Sweethearts, too.
Haunted Sweethearts?
Horror movie?
Yes!
There it is!
Hey, tell me, is the girl dead?
How would you know if you keep hiding behind your bag?
But I don't want to see it. So, is the girl dead?
There, she's dead.
-There. Look. -No…
How did she die?
How did she die?
Only you
Until there's love
My heart will yearn
Only for you
Wow, you sing with so much heart!
Of course, that song has a personal meaning to me.
You want me to sing more?
‎-You want more? ‎-That's enough, sis.
I'm having a migraine and you've sung three songs already.
Pass me the mic.
Mikey, it's your turn.
-No, it's okay. -What?
Excuse me.
Wait! Where are you going?
-Where are you going? -I just need some air.
-It won't take long. -Mikey, boy, just one song!
-No, thanks. Excuse me. -What's the matter?
Yes?
Are you okay?
Yes.
May I sit beside you?
Okay.
I went out because I was feeling claustrophobic.
Actually, Stefi doesn't really sing.
It's just that nobody has the guts to tell her about it.
Her singing gave me a headache.
Me, too!
In fact, at her sister's wedding reception,
they made a mistake by letting her sing.
She sang three songs of Celine Dion…
so the reception ended early.
And you know what…
Sorry…
I guess my story makes you sleepy.
Not at all. I'm just tired from work.
And the train we ride at Magallanes leaves early.
Don't you agree?
You're aware that we take the same train from Magallanes?
Of course.
Since when?
When we were at the movie house.
Really?
Let's go.
Where?
When I was a kid, my dad used to love fishing.
But he wasn't any good at it.
My mom said we should just buy fish from the market.
That way, we get to pick the fish that we want
without my dad getting sunburnt!
You know, I miss that.
Ever since my mom left,
we weren't able to go fishing anymore.
You know, I don't get tanned whenever I get sunburnt.
My skin just turns red like a crab!
I would like to hear your stories.
What stories?
Don't you have a story to tell?
I don't.
That's impossible!
Life is filled with stories!
Some of which may be sad, funny, or plain boring.
But in life, there's always a story to tell!
Well, sometimes,
you get to know a person better if you both stay silent.
That's deep.
You're deep.
I like that!
Why don't you--
Sorry.
I would love to hear more. You tell good stories, anyway.
What else can I share?
Did you know that my brother has had three suicide attempts already?
Why?
Because his wife left him. She went with another woman.
So, this is your place?
-You want to come in-- -Thank you.
Good night.
So…
What now?
I said…
What now?
Thank you for the evening.
Good night, Betsy.
Okay.
Shall I give you a call?
When?
When will you call me?
What?
I mean…
I'm currently training at a call center.
I might get the job soon and--
Betsy. I have your number.
‎-Okay. ‎-All right.
Good night.
Good night.
Oh, wait. Hang on.
Just a souvenir.
All right. Good night.
-Take care. -Okay.
Good night.
You chickened out again. Why don't you call her?
-Don't you think she's pretty? -I do, but…
What is it?
Come on, dude.
I just don't think she's my type.
She talks too much and she's not very ladylike.
She's just outgoing.
Being outgoing is different from being hyperactive.
Right?
I like a girl who's modest.
Reserved.
Someone who seems helpless…
Mikey?
Kat?
Dude, I'll just wait for you in the car.
How are you?
My God, it's so nice to see you again.
I'm okay.
I'm okay. How about you?
I'm good.
This is… This is so weird.
I know.
I thought you were still in the States.
I went home with my mom.
Since when? I mean…
-Why didn't you tell me? -Well, Mikey--
Were you able to find that olive oil?
Mikey, this is Ralph, my fiancé.
Ralph, this is Mikey.
A friend of mine from way, way back.
Hey, man.
Hey.
Actually, there's a reason why I'm here.
Ralph and I are getting married next month.
Oh, is that… Really?
Wow…
-Congratulations! -Thank you.
We'll go ahead, man. We still have something to look at.
Yes, I'll go ahead, too. My cousin is waiting for me.
Should I call him? Just a friendly call!
I'll just check on him.
Check on him? Does he have some kind of terminal disease?
What if he lost my number?
But I thought you gave it to him?
What if it got deleted?
Betchay,
according to Jacob, his cousin is really like that.
A bit of a weirdo.
Wait a second!
Ouch! Can you give us a minute?
When did you talk to Jacob?
We went out again last night.
-Hey, hold it right there! -Ouch! Stop pulling my hair!
That seems unfair!
Aren't you supposed to set me up with Michael?
How come it's you and Jacob who are getting along well?
They need this ASAP.
Stefi, look!
Ouch!
Answer it.
Hi, there! How are you?
Betsy?
-Yes? -Okay…
You called?
I'm sorry…
I was calling someone else, but I must have dialed the wrong name.
Mike.
-So, how are you? -Can you give me Mrs. Cervantes' files?
I'm okay.
You're in the office?
-Thank you. -Yes.
You're working?
You could say that.
Are you busy?
Sort of.
Okay.
Sorry, Betsy, I'll just call you some other time.
I have to go.
-Sure. -Okay.
-Take care. Bye. -Okay, bye.
What did he say?
He said he's busy…
and he'll call me some other time.
I hate you, Stefi!
-Ouch. -Why didn't you stop me from calling him?
Quezon Avenue, please.
One moment.
-Hurry up, the train is arriving. -Hang on, my wallet is missing.
Then step out of the line.
But I need to catch that train.
Here.
No, it's okay.
Are you going to buy a ticket or not?
Just take it.
Thank you, Betsy! I'll pay you back!
Excuse… Excuse me.
Hey! Chito!
Let's grab some lunch! Your treat!
Let's go! You can do that later.
Miss, where can I find Groundwood International Call Center?
Twelfth floor.
Betsy!
Betsy!
Michael!
-I'm okay. -Are you all right?
-Are you okay? -Sorry…
-I just-- -What are you doing here?
Someone returned my wallet.
So, I thought…
I will pay you back.
-Okay. -Thank you.
You're welcome.
Bye.
Betsy, have you eaten already?
Not yet. Why?
You want to have lunch with me? My treat.
Actually, the job at the call center is only temporary.
I really want to go abroad.
I have a Physical Therapy degree, but I still need to save up.
So, I took this job because their starting salary is high.
Besides, my parents are against my plans of leaving.
My mom would probably kill me
if she finds out I want to leave for the States.
She doesn't like Americans because she's too patriotic.
-How so? -Like I said,
it has been six months since we last talked to her.
Before she even joined the movement,
she was already a veteran activist.
She has been tear-gassed, jailed for illegal assembly,
hospitalized six times because of riots,
and was struck by a police baton!
I've never been to the States, but I like it there already.
Hang on.
I'll show you a photo of my cousin's house in the States.
Where is it? It should be…
Just a moment…
Where is it…
-My goodness… -Is this your mom?
Yes.
Why do you carry all these things with you?
For practical reasons, of course.
If you have a headache, I have paracetamol,
anti-allergy, and antacid.
And if you need a pen,
take your pick, 24 colors!
Thanks for the treat. I hope we can do this again.
Sure.
Your office is near mine. So, why not?
Yes, it's just a short walk from here.
You know where my office is?
Well, you said it's near, right?
Well, thanks again. I have to go back.
Bye.
Betsy, are you doing something on Saturday night?
No.
Why do you ask?
We're not from the province.
All Filipinos…
have ancestral roots from the province.
So, where's yours?
My mom's family is originally from Davao.
Is she a Muslim?
-No. -Is she pro or anti-abortion?
What?
What's her take on family planning?
Well, my parents are very religious.
Opus Dei?
No.
What's with the outfit?
You look like a gay man.
-Shut up… -Hey!
Where are we going?
I've long been wanting to come back here.
They serve great food for such a cheap price!
But…
I can see that you really dressed up for this date.
Oh, not really.
You're all dolled up.
Of course, I want to look good for my date and…
I want him to notice me.
Well, you've succeeded in your mission.
Hey, that's enough.
-Why? -You've had a lot already.
See? You're tipsy.
This is nothing! We're a family of heavy drinkers!
And look at yourself! You're the one who's tipsy!
You've only had two bottles, but you look flushed already!
Wait…
-Hold on. -What are you doing?
There!
Wish! They say that if you catch an eyelash,
you can make a wish!
Wait…
I caught one, too.
What was your wish?
I would rather not say.
Let's drink.
Okay.
Just go to sleep. You're drunk.
I already told you, beer doesn't get me drunk, okay?
I'll give you a call.
Next time, you don't have to announce it.
Just do it, okay?
Betsy!
Betsy…
If you plan on doing something, go ahead and do it.
I wouldn't mind.
You're unbelievable.
Yes, I am one of a kind.
Was that okay?
That felt like a grandma's kiss.
You should probably go inside.
Your parents might think we're on to something.
Don't worry, I'm sure they've done this back in their day.
You should go.
You've been saying goodbye, but you're still here!
-Bye! -Bye!
-Good night. -Good night.
Betsy!
What…
Good night, Betsy.
Some scientific studies have proven
that the feeling of being in love
is only caused by a chemical reaction.
Is it really just a chemical reaction?
A reaction that makes you feel like every song
is written for your love story?
Why do people in love seem to be over the moon…
and walking on the clouds?
Hey.
-Hi, Khalil. -What are you doing?
Life is so beautiful, isn't it?
Are you drunk again?
Each day is marked with happy memories.
Every moment becomes a chapter of a story
filled with love and meaning.
In the name of love, why can we suddenly do things
we thought we were incapable of doing?
Why do we suddenly become patient and brave?
Most of all, why does it make us happy?
It makes us so happy, am I right?
And they started chasing each other with bolos!
Can you imagine?
My siblings and I were all hiding out of fear. What if you got chased?
But, you know…
the only thing I prayed for…
was for them to break up.
Just to end the mess.
So, that's why you're so sad.
Betsy…
what are you talking about?
I'm okay. It's all in the past.
Stop crying.
It doesn't suit you.
Michael?
Since we're talking about the past,
I have a question for you.
Have you ever been in a serious relationship?
Do you really have to ask that?
Of course, I don't want any secrets between us.
Don't worry, I won't get mad.
Please?
The answer is yes. That's enough, okay?
What was she like?
Beautiful? Kind? What did you like about her?
Betsy, you can ask me about anything…
…except that.
Fine.
What did you like about me?
Betsy…
Is it because I'm beautiful?
I'm kind, sincere, honest, and sensitive, am I not?
Why are you laughing at me?
Oh, I got it.
Is it because you're happy when we're together?
Am I right? Tell me!
Too much…
Too much?
You have too much self-confidence!
Admit it! You're happy when you're with me!
-Right? Come on! -Fine! Yes!
I already said yes.
We need to reconcile those books before 11 a.m. on Friday.
Because…
Because the officers of Hermes Trading will be here.
To…
They expect us to explain the…
Whose phone is that?
I can't concentrate, it's too distracting!
Whose is it?
-Michael? -Ma'am?
-Turn it off. -Yes, ma'am.
-Now! -Yes, ma'am.
Sorry. So annoying!
‎-Hello? ‎-Why aren't you replying to my texts?
Why can't I reach you? Where have you been?
I'm here in the office.
As far as I know, there are no dead spots in your office.
Keep it down!
I turned off my phone during the meeting.
I forgot to turn it back on.
Michael, follow me.
Wait, I have to go. I'll call you later. I'm just busy now.
-You're overreacting! -Thank you.
He already told you he's at work.
What did you expect?
Well, what about me? I'm busy too, but I still make time for him!
You know, Betchay, a normal person wouldn't send
300 texts a day to someone he's obsessed with!
Right! Aside from that,
why do you always have to check on him?
You're not a doctor and he's not sick!
You're starting to annoy him!
She's like your girlfriend who's also addicted to texting!
True! My goodness!
She's too much!
I'm not annoying. ‎I'm just being thoughtful, okay?
He's the one taking me for granted.
-Okay? -Okay…
Are you mad at me?
You weren't replying to my texts.
I've been calling your office phone, but the line is always busy.
I've tried calling your cell, but you're rejecting my calls.
At least now you know how it feels.
My God, Betsy, please be reasonable.
Just because I don't pick up your calls or reply to your texts,
it doesn't mean I don't want to talk to you. It doesn't mean I don't want to talk to you.
We had a deadline, okay?
You know what? Never mind.
Let's not talk about this.
Forget it.
Did you come here to argue or to apologize?
Okay.
I'm sorry.
What kind of apology is that? It doesn't sound sincere.
What do you want me to do?
You want me to get down on my knees?
Okay. Here.
Betsy, I'm sorry.
That's too much…
What's wrong with your hand?
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes, I'm okay.
Okay.
-I'll get that. -No, I got it.
-Come on. -I'll do it.
Suit yourself. ‎Excuse me.
How long have you been friends with my son?
Just recently.
Well, he never mentions anything about you.
Come to think of it, Mikey hardly tells us anything.
He's always in his room with his computer.
By the way, is your family affiliated with a church group?
We're not.
What do you mean?
My family is not really religious.
We're more socially conscious than religious.
Oh, that's okay.
You know,
God is always in our hearts and in our spirits.
So, even if you rarely go to church,
if Jesus is in your heart and your spirit,
that should suffice.
But I assume you're Catholic, even if you're not active in church?
We are.
But…
But what?
We stopped discussing religion at home
ever since my mom joined the movement.
Movement? As in…
the rebel movement?
Oh, yes! In fact, my godfather holds one of the top positions in the NPA.
And my mom joined them.
Your mom joined them?
Yes. They went to live in the mountains.
You told my mom that your mom's a communist?
Yes.
You told me to just be myself when I'm talking to them.
Are you sure about your decision? It may just be a petty fight.
-Stefi is right. -No, we're done.
It's the end.
You've been in a relationship with Maritess for two years,
and you're just ending it like it's nothing?
Well, I finally came to my senses. I've had enough.
Come on, let me see how this looks.
Martin, you've been playing the martyr for so long,
but you've realized that just now?
But you know what?
It actually feels good after having a lovers' quarrel…
because you get to be sweet to your partner again.
Look at you.
Just because you got that accountant under your spell,
you think you're a love guru?
-Hey, that's harsh. -She's right!
But you know,
I still argue with Michael for the pettiest reasons.
What?
Why would you do that?
I noticed we become sweeter with each other after we make up.
And if we don't fight that much, the relationship gets boring.
Wait a second.
Between you and Michael,
who's the sadist and who's the masochist?
Let's just look for another restaurant.
We can't find a parking spot.
We'll find one. Don't give up so easily!
Let's check here.
-Look, I think that car is leaving. -Finally.
See? I told you so.
We wouldn't find this spot if we gave up and left.
Can you believe these idiots?
-Betsy, don't! -But that's our spot!
-Stop it! -They have no right to take it!
Betsy, stop!
Where are you going?
Betsy!
Hey, this is our spot. Move it!
-Betsy, please calm down. -Let me go!
-We were here first! -Enough…
-Why don't you fight back? -Betsy…
-How dare you! -Betsy…
You can't just steal this spot!
-What's your problem? -No, we're sorry.
You are the problem! You stole our parking space!
-Hey, we were here first! -No way! We got here first!
-Move your car somewhere else! -But we were here first!
Shit!
Bro… Maybe we can--
Michael!
You and Michael are close, aren't you?
Why don't you talk to him?
But Auntie…
I think that girl is a bad influence on him.
Auntie, Michael is way past the age of puberty.
I'm sure he knows what he's doing.
Are you sure?
To get beaten up just because of that brat?
You know your cousin is a bit naive when it comes to girls.
Betsy is not a bad person.
Was she the one who punched me?
And you know what?
What you're doing is the opposite of being a Christian.
You're judging a person without knowing her.
That's against the Bible!
Let's go.
God bless you, Auntie.
You too, Uncle.
Dude, can you tell me what really happened?
How did you end up in a fight?
I'm not in the mood to tell you.
Mikey, dude, I just want to ask…
-Are you really serious with that girl? -Of course, I am.
Come on! You don't sound so sure!
When I first saw this, I told myself, it's about time.
About time for what?
For you to wear trendy clothes!
You look a lot older than your age because of the clothes you wear.
Look, it suits you well!
It looks good on you!
Look!
Not your type?
You don't like it?
-No, it's just that-- -But you still don't like it.
-Maybe I'll wear it-- -Give it back.
What's wrong?
You don't like it!
-I want-- -You want to return it!
I like it, okay?
All I'm asking for is a little appreciation!
-He's conservative. -You mean he's not fashionable?
Aside from that, he's too stingy!
We've only been to one restaurant since we started dating!
The one that's cheap but has big servings!
The eat-all-you-can style!
Okay, so Mr. Intelligent and Elegant…
turned out to be outdated and cheap?
Now, you're having doubts…
because he's not the man of your fantasies?
Sis, remember this.
They are never the people you think they are.
Are you okay?
I'm exhausted.
I took a lot of calls…
and my jaw hurts from speaking with an accent.
So, where do you want to go?
It's up to you.
You wanted to hang out, so you decide.
-Let's just watch a movie. -A movie?
Why not?
There's nothing good to watch.
Then let's just go to the mall.
Again? Can we go somewhere else?
-What do you think? -Let's just eat outside.
I'm still full. My officemate brought food for his birthday.
I had two plates of spaghetti.
So, where should we go?
You rejected my suggestions and now you're asking me again?
Hang on, why are you mad?
I'm not mad.
Just tell me where we're going.
Nobody said that a relationship between two people…
would only be filled with happy days.
Because no two people are alike.
And because of their differences,
their love may begin to bloom…
while misunderstandings start to grow.
That's how relationships are.
Similar, opposites, yet still together.
Nobody is perfect.
These imperfections give depth to a relationship.
But it could also be the reason feelings end.
Mike, how was the meeting?
You think our boss is in a bad mood?
No, she seems to be in a good mood.
She even told a lame joke.
But we all laughed anyway.
She could use some encouragement.
Dude, check this out.
What's that?
-Excuse me, miss. -Yes, ma'am?
I'm looking for the Finance department…
-Just go straight ahead. -Where?
-Okay, miss. Thank you. -Who's that?
Her?
She's new here.
It's her first day in Finance.
Her name is Joey.
Excuse me.
What time is it?
Long story.
You were supposed to be here by 5:30.
It's 7:00.
I've been texting and calling, but you never responded.
My phone died.
I wasn't able to charge it last night.
How come?
I just forgot.
Where's our cab?
That's the other reason I'm late.
I had a hard time getting a cab, so I just walked.
So, how are we going to have dinner?
You use your hands to eat, not a cab.
You even have the nerve to act smart with me?
Excuse me?
-Yes? -Are you busy?
-Not really. -Well, I have a problem.
Should I just call Maintenance?
No, I got this.
-Are you sure you can open it? -Yes, it's just a bit tight.
See?
Okay, I got it.
Open sesame!
-Wow! Thank you. -No problem.
Thanks a lot.
Here, just call Ben, so he can check on your lock.
Okay.
I'll go ahead.
My goodness! A cockroach! Kill it! Please! Hurry!
-Cockroach! -Okay, wait. Hold on.
I got it.
Hurry up and kill it!
Die!
It's dead! Look, it's not moving!
Yuck!
Why did you use my bag to kill it?
I thought it's a folder.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Hey.
Here you go. It's all clean.
-No trace of cockroach at all. -I see.
And it smells good, too.
‎Good as new. Thank you. How kind of you.
I didn't know you're sweet. Oh, by the way.
Here's your cell phone. You left it at my desk.
No worries. And…
Thank you, too.
You know, I can handle anything except cockroaches and snakes!
-Otherwise, I go crazy. -Of course.
Thank you.
WHERE ARE YOU?
I've noticed that he has changed.
How so?
He keeps to himself most of the time.
-And-- -Why wouldn't he be? You talk too much!
Close your eyes!
No, I feel like he doesn't appreciate--
Stop it, Betchay. I've heard enough of that.
Come with me. It's about time I get frank with you.
Hey!
Okay, we're best friends, right?
Friends, best friends…
‎-More than best friends. ‎-Right? Hey, watch it!
Okay, if we're more than best friends,
I'm sure I can tell you anything, right?
And I'm just telling you this because…
I want to be honest with you, and…
I just want the best for you and this accountant…
What?
Come on, the suspense is killing me. Just spill it already!
Are you sure you can take it?
Okay.
Elizabeth.
Any guy who receives your countless text messages
with quotations from the Bible, every hour of the day…
-would definitely go nuts! -What's wrong with that?
You really don't know?
Betchay, you monitor your boyfriend
as if he's an ICU patient in critical condition!
That's just wrong!
Now, you're wondering why he's always pissed and irritated?
You should be thankful he hasn't left you!
-My God! -You don't understand.
I just want to share my life.
-Oh, please! -Ouch!
That's what you get…
from watching all those romantic movies!
Stop sharing your life as if it's some kind of charity!
You're so corny!
And will you stop acting like a kid?
Please!
Really, Stefi?
-You think so? -Of course!
You're his girlfriend, partner, and lover.
You're not his… A: Bodyguard
B: Nurse…
C: Nanny…
and most of all…
D: His mother!
Girl, he already has a mom!
And have you ever heard of the words,
A: Annoying…
B: Sickening…
C: Suffocating…
That's you!
You're not just letters A, B, and C. You're also letter D!
-You know what that is? -What?
D: All of the above!
And Betchay,
there's no such thing as a fairy godmother.
Keep that in mind.
There's no fairy godmother who will grant your wish.
That's not how life works!
You're a human being who's capable of love.
And you have to remember that your boyfriend is only human, too.
Okay?
You're so unfair, Estefania!
Why didn't you tell me that sooner? I thought we're friends.
I am your friend! That's why I'm saying this--
Ouch! You stepped on my foot!
Hey! Where are you going?
Get back here! I'm not done with your makeup!
Okay, thank you.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Michael Morelos.
Oh, Michael?
He just stepped out about 15 minutes ago.
Is that so?
Is there someone who knows where he went?
Wait.
Mr. Perez!
Chito! Come here!
Yes?
You can ask him. They work together in Accounting.
Okay.
Hi, I'm Betsy. I'm a friend of Michael.
I know. I saw your picture on his computer monitor.
You're his wallpaper.
Hey.
She told me he went out.
Would you know if he has a business meeting or--
Well, he was asking me out for lunch a while ago.
He wanted to eat at his favorite Spanish restaurant…
but he suddenly disappeared.
Where exactly is this restaurant?
Are you sure she won't get mad
if she finds out we're together?
Who are you referring to?
I know you have a girlfriend.
And who told you that gossip?
Michael, you can't hide things like that.
Besides, it's okay.
It's okay?
We're not doing anything wrong, are we?
We're just having lunch.
Why should she get mad?
And besides, you're not yet married.
And even if you are,
it doesn't mean that you can't be friends with people of the opposite sex.
Wow.
Why?
It just makes sense!
I hope, one time…
you could talk to her.
I mean…
So you can tell her what you just told me.
Excuse me, sir?
Would you like me to place your orders now, sir?
By the way, ma'am,
would you like me to raise the shades for you?
Yes, please. It's not that hot anyway.
-Okay. -Thank you.
Why?
-What are you doing? -Eyelash!
They say that if you catch an eyelash,
you can make a wish.
Then make a wish.
So, what did you wish for?
You're funny.
Hi!
Betsy…
You're the girl on his computer monitor, right?
Hi, I'm Joey.
Hi!
Michael and I work together and…
we were just talking about you.
Really?
That's right.
He told me a lot about you and--
So, what were you telling her about me?
What did you tell her?
What? Tell me!
Betsy, wait.
Betsy…
Betsy!
Betsy!
-Betsy-- -Before you think of anything…
I want you to know I didn't follow you at the restaurant.
I went to your office because I wanted to talk to you personally.
But you weren't there.
Why don't you speak up?
Nothing.
Michael, it can't always be like this.
Nothing?
It's 11:30 and you went out of your way to get here.
I'm sure you have something to tell me.
Betsy…
I don't want to know who that girl is.
Maybe I just want to clarify something.
Do you like her?
Let me rephrase that.
Do you like me?
Betsy.
I came here because…
Maybe…
it would be better…
if we give…
each other some time.
Time for what?
Time…
Time to think?
-You understand-- -Yes.
I completely understand.
-Here she comes. -Let's go.
-That's the right mindset! -They should do some research first…
-Why? -Hey.
Dad, I'm going to bed.
-Okay. -Good night, Khalil.
Good night.
Hey!
Do you really want to get our friend drunk?
Oh, please!
She can handle that!
She drinks like a sailor!
Go, girl, drink some more.
Betchay, that's enough.
It's your fault. You took it too seriously.
What did you expect?
You know, boys will always be boys,
no matter how decent they may look.
Hey! That's enough!
You're just making her more depressed.
I'm just telling her the truth!
Betch, that's enough.
-Betch, drink some more. -Betch, that's enough.
-No, Betch, drink up. -Betch, that's enough.
Leave her be!
It was so difficult!
Hey, Michael, is my shirt here?
Hey, this looks good!
It looks new! Let me borrow this.
-Let me use it. -Not this shirt!
Okay. Never mind, then.
It's all yours!
So, what really happened? Even Stefi is acting weird!
This is between you and your girl.
Leave me out of it!
It's nothing.
Nothing?
Betsy is close to having a nervous breakdown!
You're stupid!
You tried to be sneaky, but you were so careless!
You know, dude?
Every man should know the art of sneaking around!
I'll teach you.
-It's nothing like that. -Then what?
I don't know.
Things happened so fast.
I'm not even sure if I really courted her
or if it was the other way around.
So, who's that girl you got caught with?
Are you also courting her?
Dude, you have to make up your mind!
It's either you're serious or you're just playing around.
If you're just playing around, make sure the girl isn't serious.
Because if she is serious, it will only end up badly!
Get it, dude?
You can have it.
Hello?
Hello, Betchay?
Is there a problem?
Nothing.
Bye.
Are you busy?
No.
-I'm fine. Why? -No, you're not fine.
I've noticed for a few days that…
something is wrong with you.
Is it your girl?
Michael, it is not the end of the world.
You know, there are--
-But-- -Enough with the sad stories.
I easily get depressed.
I feel bad whenever my friends are sad.
That's why…
I'll try to make you happy.
I want to remove the sour look on your face.
Why are you doing this?
Because I want to.
What's wrong with that?
Why are you not drinking?
I already told you, I don't drink much.
But you're okay?
Then stop looking at your watch!
I feel like I'm dating Cinderella.
Oh, my God! It's my friend, Celine!
I didn't know she got back from the States. Let's join them!
No, thank you…
It's too crowded over there. A lot of smokers, too.
Michael, we've been sitting here for hours!
It can't be just the two of us the whole night.
What's wrong with that?
Michael, there are other people in this world, you know?
Go ahead and join your friends if you like.
What about you?
I'll stay here.
Are you sure?
Okay, I'll be there for a while. Bye!
-Celine! Hi! -Hey!
-Hello! -Hello!
-Hello! -Hello! -Hi. -How are you?
-Hi! -Who's your date?
He's just an officemate.
These days, it's hard to find a woman
who takes relationships seriously.
They change partners as if they're just changing clothes.
You don't want another drink, sir?
I was shocked!
You really had to tell that to Mom?
Can you imagine if he was wearing a dress?
Come on, I just really liked that toy.
It's not like--
-Go ahead and show it to her! -No way!
Dad?
Betsy?
You're home.
Your father reached out to me.
He said you needed your mother.
I knew this time would come.
Forgive me, Betsy.
Don't cry.
My little girl is all grown up.
Beer?
I could use one.
I noticed.
Looks like you had a good night.
I'm not even drunk.
Is something wrong?
Are you and Mommy having problems again?
That's part of my daily life.
Dad?
Have you ever thought of leaving your wife?
I've thought about it a number of times.
Different reasons.
Different scenarios.
And?
Two things.
It's either I'm too proud…
or I'm a coward.
What do you mean?
I'm arrogant in the sense…
that your mom picked me over her other suitors,
I don't think I can accept that we didn't make it work.
On the other hand, I'm a coward
because I thought that if we do get separated…
and I don't handle it well,
I might just realize that I'm better off with her.
You're not making sense, Dad.
I've been that way for 24 years now!
And for 24 years,
I've been asking myself why I love your mother so much!
To think we're so different from each other.
She's controlling, always nagging, and jealous!
She gets pissed if you don't pick up her calls.
Forget about her birthday, expect a war!
Even if she knows you're tired,
she still expects you to tell her about your day!
Even if it's a lame story,
she expects you to listen because if you don't--
-She won't stop nagging you! -She will ignore you for a week!
After that, she starts sulking.
Because…
-she thinks she's taken for granted-- -Exactly!
But if she's not around,
you don't seem contented.
Like something is missing.
-You'll miss the noise. -It's suddenly all quiet!
-You're uneasy! -You want to hit somebody!
-Because you badly miss her! -So much!
Then what's the problem?
Do you love her?
What if she leaves me just like Katherine did?
Is her name Katherine?
It's Betsy.
Even if her name is Katherine, they're still different.
I don't know, Dad. Maybe…
I don't want to end up like you and Mommy.
Then don't!
How can I be sure?
You can't be sure.
I can't guarantee that you won't get hurt again.
I can't guarantee that you won't have problems.
But I also can't guarantee that you won't be happy!
Because that's how love goes!
Not knowing…
is the sweetest mystery in loving another person.
And how much you can love…
is the greatest discovery…
you can have of yourself.
Is Dad still your ideal man?
He still is.
You know, the concept of an ideal man
has a different meaning when you're young and in love.
You may think the person you love is perfect…
and you expect him to stay that way.
But as you grow older,
you'll start to see the real him.
That he's not perfect just like you.
Just like everybody else.
But, Mom?
Does that mean…
you made a mistake in choosing him?
Doesn't it frustrate you? Do you stop caring?
You feel hopeless!
You get what I mean?
Do you stop loving?
Of course not.
It only means that if you truly love him,
you'll learn to accept his imperfections.
And he should do the same.
And the most important thing…
what you both have to accept about each other…
is the fact that you're never alike
and are continuously changing.
It seems difficult.
That's because you're in love!
Excuse me.
Betsy?
-Excuse me. -Betsy!
Betsy!
-Hang on. -You're cutting in line!
-I… -Watch it.
I just want to tell you something.
What?
You're annoying.
You meddle too much.
You talk too much.
You're hot-headed.
-Sometimes… -He said she meddles too much.
you're pissing me off.
Betsy!
Betsy!
Let me through!
Betsy! Wait!
Betsy!
Betsy!
-Hey! -Mister!
I'm sorry, but I need your motorcycle.
I'm so sorry.
-I'll pay you later! -Okay, hop on.
You may sit here, ma'am.
Thank you.
Are you okay, ma'am?
I hate him.
He didn't have the guts to tell me in person.
He broke up with me through a letter!
"I realized that I don't love you anymore."
Don't cry.
At least, he told you what he truly feels.
He was honest…
and he didn't give you false hopes.
If that's true,
then why can't he say it to my face?
That's what hurts me the most.
Have you ever been in love?
Who knows? This may be a blessing in disguise.
Maybe…
there's someone who's more deserving to have you.
Oh, no! I missed my stop!
This letter is too long.
I'm sorry, but I really have to go.
Good luck with your love life.
Good luck with yours, too.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Thanks again.
Hey! Wait! Your flowers!
Thank you!
Stop right there!
Excuse me.
Betsy?
Betsy!
Betsy!
-Stop right there! -Betsy! Let go of me!
-Don't jump in there! -Betsy! Hey!
-Betsy! Wait! -That's dangerous, sir!
I want to tell you something!
Get lost! I don't want to hear it!
This is important! Please listen to me!
Betsy, please!
You're stubborn!
Meddlesome!
Talkative!
Hot-headed!
-Sometimes, you annoy me! -You really want to get hurt?
Hold on, let me finish!
This is important! Wait. Please!
Get off me!
And because that's who you are,
I realized something.
Betsy, I love you so much!
And whatever happens,
I don't want you to change!
Say something.
I'm starting to look like a fool here.
What did you say?
You heard it already. Don't make me say it again.
I love you so much!
Betsy!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Betsy!
I love you so much, Betsy.
I really do.
And that's what everyone hopes for.
To find that person
they're destined to be with for the rest of their lives.
And it's gone.
ALVIN: Whatever.
Maybe we should take a break.
That's it. I can't take this anymore. I can't. I give up.
I'm sick of struggling for survival.
Competing with gophers and earthworms and that loser sparrow...
...who always takes my nuts.
And I'm especially sick of this stupid... ...stupid tree.
-Whoa. What's happening? -Guys.
-Whoa. What's happening? -Guys. I think he made it angry.
I'm awake.
I'm up...
...and I'm late.
Demo. Dave Seville.
Keys. Bag.
Pants. I need pants. Pants are essential.
Claire. -Dave. -Hey.
-Dave. -Hey. How's it going?
I haven't seen you since.... Well, since you said you never wanted to see me again.
So I guess it worked. What a fun day that was.
Let me guess. You're late for something again.
-Same old Dave. -Not following you.
You know, the guy who's always fooling around... ...who can't handle a serious relationship.
That was the old Dave. How about we get together, talk about the new Dave?
Tomorrow night. My place.
-I.... -Great.
-No-- -You look good, Claire.
Where are we?
Well, I think they remodeled our forest. I like it. Stylish, yet functional.
Uh, where did the mountains go?
Give me a break. We're in a building, Theodore.
Dave.
-Ian. -Hey, big guy.
Hey, you ever seen the view from the 80th floor?
-No. They never let me past the lobby. -What? I can't....
Hey, back off, man, this is Dave Seville.
Mr. Seville, can I offer you some muffins, scones, pastries?
No. I'd hate to be a bother.
It's no problem. We have an omelet station.
Omelet station. Hm.
Can I get you some water or a soy latte? How about a shot of wheatgrass juice?
Maybe later. Thanks.
Let's talk about your song, Dave.
Well, as crazy as it sounds... -...the original inspiration came to me-- -The song sucks, Dave.
-...the original inspiration came to me-- -The song sucks, Dave.
-What? -Your song? It's awful. I hate it.
-What? -Your song? It's awful. I hate it. You know, I mean, who's gonna sing it? Justin, Fergie? Not a chance.
You know, I mean, who's gonna sing it? Justin, Fergie? Not a chance.
I need something new. I need something fresh. -That is new. -The next big thing.
Dave, we go way back, all right?
And we've both come a long way since college. You? Not so much.
I wanted to like that song, but you heard it. Not that good.
If I wasn't your friend, I'd say:
"Dave, you go right back out of this office... ...and you keep writing music. You'll get there someday."
...and you keep writing music. You'll get there someday." But I am your friend, so I'm going to tell you...
...that there is no sense in writing songs... ...that no one is ever, ever going to sing.
Ever?
Excuse me. Can I get some of that water?
We ran out.
Hey!
ALVIN: Out of the way. SIMON: Alvin... -...slow down. ALVIN: Move your butt, Theodore.
-...slow down. ALVIN: Move your butt, Theodore.
THEODORE: Ouch! You stepped on my tail.
Last one to the door is roadkill. I'm in.
Hm. What are these shiny things? -Theodore, we're leaving now. -Oh.
Okay, this wasn't my best idea. Look out! Maniac!
Back to tree. Back to tree.
SIMON: Back to the dog. Back to the dog!
-Basket! Three o'clock. THEODORE: Which way is 3 o'clock?
ALVIN: This way. THEODORE: Guys, wait for me. Wait up. I still have baby fat, you know.
Wait up. I still have baby fat, you know. ALVIN: Jump. You've gotta really want it. THEODORE: I want it.
ALVIN: Jump. You've gotta really want it. THEODORE: I want it. -I want it. -I can't hang like this all day.
-I want it. -I can't hang like this all day. Will you jump already?
Ooh! Muffins.
THEODORE: Gross. Is this his house?
ALVIN: No. It's his garbage can. THEODORE: Oh.
ALVIN: This must be where he stores his food for winter.
Come on, baby. Come to papa!
Hello, gorgeous. THEODORE: Wow.
SIMON: We've hit the mother lode.
This is the greatest day of my life.
Eureka! I found the cheese balls.
Alvin, what are you doing? Don't make a mess.
Cannonball.
Quick. Hide.
Hurry, you guys.
Did I put these here?
There you are. I got you.
ALVIN: Hm. He's been out for quite a while.
You guys, he's dead. Don't panic. Wipe everything down.
Don't panic. Wipe everything down.
I need three garbage bags, a shovel, some disinfectant... ...some latex gloves and oregano, go!
Hang on, Sherlock. He's coming to.
I must be hearing things.
Oh, this is trippy.
Sir, are you all right?
Get back!
Squirrels can't talk.
Hey. Whoa. Wha-ba-ba-ba-bo.
Watch it, genius. We are chipmunks. Chipmunks.
Chipmunks can't talk either.
Our lips are moving and words are coming out.
This is not happening.
I am not talking to chipmunks. I am not talking to chipmunks.
So how's that working for you, Dave?
How do you know my name? I'll field that one. We read your mail. By accident.
You really ought to pay that utility bill, Dave. -You ever heard of a credit rating? THEODORE: What's this thing?
-You ever heard of a credit rating? THEODORE: What's this thing?
Hey. Hey. Hey. Stop doing-- Turn that off.
Sorry. Uh, heh, heh. He fell out of the tree at birth.
Can all animals talk?
Well, I believe fish have this type of sign language.
Hey, Dave, do all humans have houses that smell like sweat socks?
[SINGING] Dave likes to wear Dirty underwear with little hairs
We're getting off on the wrong foot.
Allow us to introduce ourselves.
Hello, I'm Simon, the smart one. -He's Alvin. -The awesomest one.
-He's Alvin. -The awesomest one. And I'm Theodore.
Oh, nice to meet you. Now get out of my house.
But we talk.
Which makes me want you out of my house that much more.
It's creepy. Unnatural. Somewhat evil.
I kind of liked him better when he was unconscious.
-Gotcha. Ha-ha-ha. ALVIN: Hey.
SIMON: Don't do this, Dave. We can gnaw right through this door.
THEODORE: Hi.
Oh, uh, were we disturbing you?
What, you guys can sing too?
That's not singing. This is singing.
This is amazing.
Here, everyone inside.
-There you go. -Thank you.
All right, here's the deal.
You guys sing my songs, you get to sleep here.
No. Wait. Is breakfast included?
I can live with that. What about TV privileges?
Okay, but not after 7. -Eight. -Done.
But don't tell your animal friends, because I don't wanna come home...
But don't tell your animal friends, because I don't wanna come home... ...and find rabbits and skunks on my couch.
Filthy creatures, Dave. Never associate with them. Yeah, you're our only friend.
No, no, no. Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.
Let's just start with me being your songwriter.
Um, let me ask you. Have you ever written a song before?
-Yup. -And is that your music stuff outside?
Yup.
Oh, no! Hurry back.
So, fellas, all we gotta do is find the right song, rehearse--
So, fellas, all we gotta do is find the right song, rehearse-- Ow.
-Hey, Dave. -Simon.
Whoopsie. My bad.
This is my sheet music.
DAVE: Alvin.
This is not a Hula-Hoop. It's a towel rack.
-Killjoy. -Are you guys always like this?
We're kids, Dave.
Well, where are your parents?
When you're a chipmunk, your parents take care of you for a week.
Then they take off.
Our parents were hippies. They left early to join a commune.
ROBOT: I am Robert the Robot. -Help! Crazy robot. Help! It's after me!
ROBOT: I am Robert the Robot. -Help! Crazy robot. Help! It's after me! -It's after me. -Hey. Hey. Be careful with that.
-It's after me. -Hey. Hey. Be careful with that.
-Sorry. DAVE: It's a collectible.
-Sorry. DAVE: It's a collectible. -I got it for Christmas last year. -Christmas! We love Christmas.
-I got it for Christmas last year. -Christmas! We love Christmas.
Even though we've never actually celebrated it. But we want to.
Yeah, you can never go wrong with Christmas.
Oh, maybe we can celebrate it with you.
Uh, yeah, maybe.
Look, I've had a long and weird day, so off to bed.
Look, I've had a long and weird day, so off to bed. Come on.
We start work tomorrow.
I want you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed by 8.
My tail isn't bushy till 9.
Not my problem. Now go to sleep.
I hope Christmas comes fast. THEODORE: Me too.
[SINGING] Want a plane that loops the loop?
Loop. Hoop.
Hula-Hoop.
Here's trouble. Fire in the hole!
What are you guys doing? Nothing. What are you doing?
Nothing. What are you doing? Stand back, Dave. She's gonna blow!
Stand back, Dave. She's gonna blow!
I got it. I got it, guys. Come to papa.
-Hey. Where did it go? -Simon, this landed right in front of you.
-Hey. Where did it go? -Simon, this landed right in front of you. -You didn't see it? -Hm.
-How many fingers am I holding up? -Um. Four. No, no, no. Eight? Counting your thumb?
Four. No, no, no. Eight? Counting your thumb?
-Wait, wait, wait-- -Hang on a second.
SIMON: Six. Final answer is six.
Try these. -How's that? -Wow.
-How's that? -Wow. Someone trashed your house.
It was clean when I went to bed last night.
Well, we colored for a while, but then we got hungry.
Well, we colored for a while, but then we got hungry. Wanna see what we colored?
Actually, I wanna play you something. I wrote a song for you guys to sing, so let's--
We've put a few toaster waffles aside for winter.
And we're not sharing.
Guys, we're gonna have food all winter, so if you start storing it...
Guys, we're gonna have food all winter, so if you start storing it... ...it's gonna get gross and we're gonna have rodent....
Bad, you know, non-talking rodents around here.
Let's go. Let's get to work.
All right, you chipmunks. Ready to sing your song?
SIMON: I'll say we are. THEODORE: Yeah. Let's sing it now.
-Ready, Simon? -Okay.
DAVE: Ready, Theodore? -Okay.
Alvin? Alvin?
This kicks a hamster wheel's butt.
-Alvin! -Whoa!
Okay!
[SINGING] Christmas, Christmastime is near
Time for toys and time for cheer
We've been good, but we can't last
Hurry, Christmas, hurry fast
Want a plane that loops the loop
Me, I want a Hula-Hoop
We can't hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late
What?
WOMAN: Dave Seville's in the lobby. He says he won't leave without seeing you.
Ugh. That loser again?
-Dave. -Ian.
-Okay. -I've got something for you. -It's your next big thing. -Dave.
Don't say anything.
IAN: What the...?
Dave, don't do this to yourself, man. They sing.
No. They don't.
They do. Just give me a second.
Come on, guys.
[SINGING] Want a plane that loops the loop
Me, I want a Hula-Hoop
You know, Dave...
...some people might say it's kind of weird... ...that a grown man would want a Hula-Hoop.
...that a grown man would want a Hula-Hoop. And others would say, "You know what's weirder than that?
And others would say, "You know what's weirder than that? A grown man bringing another grown man...
...a big box with a bunch of chipmunks in it...
...who not only speak English but can sing."
They do sing. We've been practicing all morning.
Oh, you've been practicing. I never realized. Okay, well.
Yeah. Okay, no. Dave, I'm going to pretend...
Yeah. Okay, no. Dave, I'm going to pretend... ...that I have a lunch to go to. Oops.
I've got a lunch to go to.
What was that?
Nothing. Nothing. Just a little stage fright.
I thought my heart was gonna explode.
We're not performing monkeys. Why do we have to sing for that guy?
Well, how's this? Pretend I need the money and I hate my job... ...and you're staying at my place, so you owe me.
We're sorry, Dave.
Yeah, that helps.
Never mind. I'm late for work.
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Can we go with you?
What, so you can mess that up too? Uh-uh. You're going home.
Can I stand in your lap and steer? Oh, can we at least beep the horn?
Never mind.
So sorry about the delay. It should be a couple more minutes.
But we're building the suspense. Ha-ha.
-Oh! Here he is. -Sorry I'm late.
Boy, am I jazzed about our Yum-able Energy Bars commercial.
That's Good-able Energy Bar commercial.
Right, Good-able. Uh.... Okay, here's the pitch.
Okay, here's the pitch. We open on a group of lethargic kids.
Close-up on a little girl's face. She's sad.
Our customers don't like to think of their kids as being sad.
Could she be flying a kite?
I like kites.
Good.
Okay, great. She's flying a kite.
She's running with a kite. She's running out of steam.
She's tired and lets go of the kite.
Oh, no. We see her face, it's sad.
-But not too sad. DAVE: Right.
So she pulls out her Good-able Energy Bar--
It's my mom. Sorry.
-Hi, Mom. SIMON: A little situation, Dave.
Um, Theodore vacuumed up Alvin.
THEODORE: Alvin. ALVIN: Dave, help!
-What? SIMON: At least it wasn't... ...the garbage disposal.
Just stay calm.
SIMON: And there goes Theodore.
Look, I can't do this right now, okay?
I absolutely understand but-- Sorry, Dave? Quick question.
How do you feel about an indoor pool?
Look, if you flood my house, you're dead. Out on the street, capiche?
Mothers.
Why don't we come over here and look at the sales projections?
You know, when I first saw these numbers, I thought there's just no way...
...but then I looked again.
The "size of Theodore's butt"?
Why don't we come back to that?
Anyway, 10 years ago, the market share for healthy food snacks... ...was imperceptible among 6- to 12-year-olds.
...was imperceptible among 6- to 12-year-olds.
MAN: "How smart Simon thinks he is"?
Yeah, as opposed to how smart he actually is.
Who's Simon?
-I didn't-- -Just move it along.
You know what? I think I'll just clean out my office. Sounds good.
Uh, guys. What's this about?
Obviously, Theodore's butt.
We told you we colored.
On my presentation boards? You got me fired. THEODORE: Oh.
We didn't know.
-We're sorry, Dave. -Oh, you're sorry? That's fantastic.
Sorry doesn't get my job back, now, does it, Theodore?
Why are my clothes all over the place?
We used them to mop up the water. Good idea, right?
-Oh, my God. Theodore, did you just--? -Um, um....
It's a raisin, Dave.
Prove it.
Okay, you got me. I wanna talk to all you guys. Where's Alvin?
DAVE: Alvin? -You owe me bigtime.
Alvin.
There's this new thing. It's called knocking.
-Get out. -Uh, I'm waiting for the rinse cycle.
-Out. -Whoa, whoa. I'm taking a shower here.
You know, if I made a list of my worst days ever... ...today would be at the top of the list.
And it's still early.
Clam it, sudsy.
Okay. Guys, let me just put it to you like this, okay?
I have no job, no career, my house is always a mess. Thank you very much.
CLAIRE [ON RECORDING]: Hi, Dave. It's Claire Wilson calling.
And, oh, why did I just say my last name?
That was weird. I guess I'm just a little nervous about coming over for dinner.
-Dinner. -So, yeah. I'm gonna hang up now.
-Dinner. -So, yeah. I'm gonna hang up now. I'll be there at 7. Okay. Bye.
I'll be there at 7. Okay. Bye.
That's half an hour.
THEODORE: Who's Claire?
Claire is Dave's mate. Ooh-la-la.
She is not my mate. She's my ex-mate.
Okay. This is great.
Dave. Dave, relax.
You just go get the food. We'll take care of the rest.
Why am I having a hard time believing you?
That hurts, Dave. That really hurts.
-Yeah. We're all in this together, Dave. -Like a family.
No. Not like a family.
-Tick-tock, Dave. Better bust a move. -Right.
We also do offices and recreational vehicles.
What's that smell?
It's your cologne.
What did you do? Dump the entire bottle on the rug?
SIMON: We call it scenting the area.
I gotta admit I'm surprised.
The place looks great.
Well, Dave, we chipmunks are notoriously tidy.
DAVE: Yeah, I see that.
-Those bread sticks smell great. THEODORE: Yeah.
So when's dinner?
Guys, I don't know how to tell you this...
...but it's just gonna be Claire and me.
Whoa, hold the phone, Dave. -We can't have-- -No.
-Even if we-- DAVE: No.
-We thought it-- -And no. Look, in the other room.
Jeez.
What a buzzkill, man.
CLAIRE: I never knew you could cook this well.
DAVE: Well, it's all about slow roasting.
It takes longer. But when it comes to flavor, why rush?
Well, I'm impressed.
I've been seeing your photos in the paper. Yeah, it's going really great.
How about you, how's your job?
Great. Loving it.
How do you think it's going?
Terrible. They're not even sniffing each other.
Alvin. Dave said that--
Dave needs a little help from the love doctor.
And his assistant. Get back here.
You know, this is nice.
Just two friends having dinner. Hanging out. No pressure. Nothing weird.
Um.... My stereo does that all the time. It's like it has a mind of its own.
You were saying?
Oh, nothing. I was just a little nervous about coming over here.
I wasn't sure if you thought this was a date or something.
A date? No.
Um, the wiring in my unit is shot.
You should get an electrician to fix that.
I don't need anyone to fix anything for me.
Okay.
Could you excuse me for a moment? I'm gonna go check the fuse box.
Hey.
Look, I know what you guys are up to. Alvin.
-Breath check. -Where's Al--? Ow!
Dave, are you okay?
DAVE: Everything's fine.
Why did you do that?
I was just trying to help, Dave. You have garlic breath.
Well, stop helping. You're ruining everything.
I think I got something in my eye.
Here. Let me see.
Yeah. It looks really irritated. It's so red. What happened?
What was that?
Oh, I thought I saw a rat.
-A rat? -Probably nothing. Here, let's finish eating, huh?
Tomorrow I'm gonna call the exterminator.
-What? -Claire.
Dave? Dave?
-Tell her she completes you. CLAIRE: What are you doing?
-You got it, Dave. CLAIRE: Dave.
Dave, let go.
I'm sorry, Claire. It's just....
I lost my job, Claire.
And I guess I just needed a hug.
Well, why didn't you just say so? Tell me what happened.
Well, this is gonna sound really strange.
No games. No fooling around.
-The truth? -Please, I'm begging you.
My life is being sabotaged by talking chipmunks.
-You know what? DAVE: I'm not crazy, I swear.
CLAIRE: You haven't changed at all.
Wait. Claire. Don't go. I can explain.
Chipmunks.
ALVIN: You should've kissed her, Dave.
She wanted you. SIMON: Alvin, you're not helping.
Don't give up, Dave.
Go away. Leave me alone.
THEODORE: Dave, would you like a cookie?
I said, leave me alone.
-Is it me, or was he a little mad? -Oh, hm, hm.
I wonder, is Dave mad? Yes.
He really did have garlic breath.
Yeah, well-played, guys.
Idea. Ding-ding-ding-ding!
Who has cab fare?
Cab fare? We don't even have pockets.
DAVE: Dear fellas, I'm sorry, but this isn't really working out.
I don't know what made me think I could handle you guys...
...when I can barely manage my own life.
You should go back to your real home in the forest.
That's what's best for all of us.
I'm sorry it has to be this way, but....
Guys?
Simon, Theodore?
Guys?
Alvin?
Alvin!
Simon?
Theodore?
Alvin?
Alvin.
IAN: Hello?
Hello?
Kids.
CHIPMUNKS [SINGING]: Christmas, Christmastime is near
Time for toys and time for cheer
We can't hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late
Welcome to Jett Records.
Okay. New rule. No going out after 9. And not at all unless I know where you're going.
Were you worried about us, Dave?
No. I just need to know, that's all.
Wait. If you're not worried, then why do you need to know?
I need to know, okay?
Ow. Alvin.
Oh.
Oh, sorry about that. Yeah.
-Sorry. -Kids, huh?
They keep you on your toes. Do you have any?
Three boys.
Well, some days are better than others.
And some days you just wanna close them in a box... ...leave the box in the park and run away, you know?
...leave the box in the park and run away, you know?
Oh.
SIMON: Quick, hide.
Guys, what's all this?
Toaster waffles.
You know, I can't afford all these toaster waffles.
Aw.
-What? -Well, in case you didn't notice... ...I don't have a job anymo--
My song?
-All right. -Yeah.
-Hello? -Hey, Dave.
Hey, how's my favorite songwriter?
-Ian? -Tell me you've heard the song.
Yeah. I'm listening to it right now. How did you--? When did--?
Speed of business, baby. That's how we do it. That's how I roll.
Got a friend in satellite radio, put it in immediate rotation.
And that video of your little guys, 10 million hits already on YouTube.
Bingo, bango, boongo, bonga, bonga.
Ha-ha-ha. It's crazy. I gotta go.
Hey, put some clothes on those guys. It's kind of embarrassing.
We owed you, Dave.
THEODORE: So we're good with the toaster waffles, right? Uh, Dave?
DAVE: Soup's on.
Alvin.
So, what do you think?
Cool.
All right.
Toothbrush, huh? Okay.
No.
Dave...
...are you awake?
I am now.
I had a nightmare.
Can I sleep with you?
Um.... You won't even know I'm here.
Okay. Sure. But stay on that side of the bed.
Oh, okay.
Theodore, that's not your side of the bed.
-Theodore, wake up. It's Christmas. -Come on, man. It's Christmas.
-Theodore, wake up. It's Christmas. -Come on, man. It's Christmas. Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
[SINGING] On the first day of Christmas Dave woke up
Come on, man, it's Christmas. Hallelujah.
Wake up, lazy bones.
Oh, yeah. Christmas.
THEODORE: Up and at them. ALVIN: You can sleep when you're dead.
THEODORE: Up and at them. ALVIN: You can sleep when you're dead. -I'm coming SIMON: Come on, Dave.
-I'm coming SIMON: Come on, Dave.
THEODORE: Hurry up, Dad. -Dad? -Dave. I said Dave.
-Dad? -Dave. I said Dave.
ALVIN: This is shaping up to be my favorite Christmas ever.
SIMON: You want to open mine first. -Open mine first.
ALVIN: No, Dave, mine is better. -Wow. You guys got me presents?
Of course.
All right. Simon?
Wow, it's a--
It's a paper-clip compass.
A paper-clip compass. Now I'll never get lost.
Me next. Alvin.
-My wallet. -Do you like it?
-My wallet. -Do you like it? Really? I wanted to get you something you'd use every day.
And I have been using this for almost 10 years now.
Very thoughtful, Alvin. Thank you.
Yeah, the look on your face says it all, Dave.
Oh, nicely done, Theodore. "To Dav."
Let's see, it says, "Merry Christmas. Love, Theodore."
And it's got a nice picture of some pineapples?
Those aren't pineapples. That's our family.
Look, fellas. Let's make sure we understand each other here.
I'm not your....
You know, your dad or anything, right?
But you're like a dad.
Well, not really.
I mean, we're friends for sure.
And I write your music, you know, manage your career.
-Make us sweaters. -Feed us.
Let us sleep in your bed when we have nightmares.
That's what friends do.
So who wants to open their presents?
ALVIN: Is that a trick question? We do. THEODORE: Yeah.
ALVIN: Is that a trick question? We do. THEODORE: Yeah. -Presents. SIMON: Oh, boy.
THEODORE: Presents. Presents. Presents.
I can't wait to open mine first.
Envelope.
They're savings bonds.
Cool.
You know, in seven years, you're gonna get to buy something really nice.
Do you maybe have any that you bought seven years ago? Ow.
-Alvin, manners. -Thank you, Dave.
Yeah. Thanks, Dave.
-Ian? -Who wants presents?
IAN: All right. -Cool. IAN: Hey, there's plenty more where this came from.
Bring them on in, fellas.
SIMON: Oh, yeah. ALVIN: Jackpot.
What are you doing?
IAN: Taking care of my boys.
ALVIN: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
Weird. What happened to your presents?
-Which one is mine? -That big one is for me, I think.
What did you get them?
Savings bonds.
Great. Just what every kid dreams of.
You're in luck. Your Uncle Ian came through. -Cool. -Uncle Ian?
-Cool. -Uncle Ian?
Is--? Is this for me?
No, it's for Simon.
-Theodore. THEODORE: Oh, boy.
-And Alvin. -Thank you, Santa.
This is for you. You like the Oak Ridge Boys, right?
Yeah, you're welcome. And guess what, guys.
Uncle Ian is gonna have a big launch party for the new CD.
That's right. Press, paparazzi. Hollywood hotshots.
The whole nine yards.
-Awesome. -Sweet.
Yeah. Dave, you've got one week to write me a new hit single.
All right? Something funky and fresh.
-Peace. We out. THEODORE: Bye, Uncle Ian.
-Peace. We out. THEODORE: Bye, Uncle Ian. -Merry Christmas. -Now it really is Christmas.
-Merry Christmas. -Now it really is Christmas.
Whoa! Mayday, mayday. Whoo-hoo!
This way, this way, this way.
IAN: All right. All right. Settle in, settle in. Thank you for coming.
It is a very special night tonight.
Here at Jett Records, we pride ourselves on bringing you tomorrow's music today.
Oh, and guess what. I did it again.
Ladies and gentlemen, here to sing their new hit single...

-You mind if I grab a few pics? -Claire. Uh.... -Not at all. Fire away. CLAIRE: Great.
I've got a new assignment. I'm covering your rise to fame.
-Oh, this is Alvin, Simon and Theodore. -Hi.
CLAIRE: Hello. -Hi, Claire.
You're hot.
Forgot you guys haven't officially met.
So, Dave... ...I'm sorry about that night. I really thought that you--
That I was insane?
I totally understand it. Talking chipmunks. It's a lot to take in over dinner.
But look at you now. You've got the career, promising future, kids.
But look at you now. You've got the career, promising future, kids. You're like a family.
Don't say "family" in front of Dave. It gives him gas.
-Like, clear-the-room gas. -Does not.
He doesn't want a family.
Why don't you guys go and play or raid the dessert table?
CLAIRE: Don't take it personally, you guys.
Some people don't know a good thing when they've got it.
Right, Dave?
Claire.
No offense, big guy, but you are not good at this.
Hey, what do you think of this?
-What is it? -It's Alvin.
That looks nothing like Alvin.
Well, yeah. It's a prototype. We'll sell a million of these things.
Well, yeah. It's a prototype. We'll sell a million of these things. It's voice-activated. Here, say something to it.
Hello, ugly little Alvin doll that looks nothing like Alvin.
-See? You love it. It's Spanish. -You know what? That's just weird.
Come on, Dave, Dave, Dave.
We've got to expand the Munks' fan base.
I mean, forget about the music.
The music is but a means to the big money, okay?
I'm talking about our own fur clothing line, cologne.
I'm talking about our own fur clothing line, cologne. Chipmunk Heat, something like that. Chipmunk wine coolers.
-I mean-- -They're just kids.
No, they're rats.
And they could make us both so much money... -...if you just let me work with them. -I can't hear you, the music's too loud.
-...if you just let me work with them. -I can't hear you, the music's too loud.
Don't go against me on this, Dave. I never lose.
Has anyone tried the chocolate meatballs?
I'll probably go into insulin shock. But it's worth it.
Oh, a sweet, sweet, sweet molasses meat.
Hey, Alvster. Love the song, bro.
-Up top. -What's up, player?
So I see you're enjoying my little spread that I've put out for you guys.
What am I talking about? You probably eat like this all the time.
Well, Dave says he doesn't wanna spoil us.
Dude, you're a rock star. You're supposed to be spoiled.
I mean, you should be riding in limousines and private planes.
I mean, you should be riding in limousines and private planes. And you should be going to parties like this every night.
And you should be going to parties like this every night.
Really? Because Dave says we need our sleep.
Look, Alvin, this is hard to say but, I mean, I gotta be upfront about it.
Look, Alvin, this is hard to say but, I mean, I gotta be upfront about it. Dave's holding you back, you know. I could be making you 20 large a day.
Dave's holding you back, you know. I could be making you 20 large a day.
-Hm. Is that a lot? -Yes.
Another thing-- I'm not gonna tell you. I will tell you.
Another thing-- I'm not gonna tell you. I will tell you. Look, behind your back, Dave calls you...
..."the rats."
-Rats? -Yeah. Whatever, right? I know.
-Rats? -Yeah. Whatever, right? I know. Well, don't let it bother you. I mean, me? I consider you boys family.
Well, don't let it bother you. I mean, me? I consider you boys family.
And if there's anything you need, anything at all...
...give your uncle Ian a call, all right?
-Oh, right. -Ciao.
ALVIN: Come on, pal. You drive like my grandmother.
Get a wheelchair. Move over!
SIMON: Hey, guys, look at me. Up, up and away.
Alvin.
Can't help you, Simon. I'm about to take the lead here.
Hey, guys, I have an idea for a new song.
Hey, Dave.
What's going on in here? I thought I told you guys to clean up.
We are.
Um.... -Who's that? -Uncle Ian hired us a housekeeper.
-Who's that? -Uncle Ian hired us a housekeeper.
She's also a masseuse. Rrrr.
ALVIN: Come on, move over, road hog. Drive it or park it, pal. Get in the slow lane.
-Where did you get that game? -Uncle Ian.
Move it or lose it! Get some training wheels, buddy.
Okay, you know what? That's enough.
What are you doing? I was about to beat my high score.
Too bad. Where's Theodore?
-Spit it out. -Mm-mm. -Spit it out. -No.
-Spit it out. -No.
Jett Records.
Okay. That's it. Meeting. Now. Everyone on the couch.
Could you give us a minute?
Guys, look, it's hard, I know.
Three months ago, you were hanging out in a tree somewhere and now you're--
[IN DEEP VOICE] Major rock stars.
Okay. Whatever. My point is just because you're--
Okay. Whatever. My point is just because you're-- Major rock stars.
Doesn't mean you can have or do whatever you want.
Well, Uncle Ian says we should always be happy.
Okay, you know what? He's not your uncle.
He also, David, said that we should be making $20 a day.
Guess what. You're making way more than that.
And because I care, I'm putting it all away for you.
Just like storing nuts for the winter.
Oh, winter's for losers.
Yeah. Shouldn't we have a say in how to build our investment portfolio?
Where is all this coming from? You guys are just kids.
-Kids, Dave, or rats? -What?
Well, Uncle Ian says we're like his family.
Oh, yeah? Well, if you love Uncle Ian so much...
...and don't think I'm watching out for you... ...why don't you go live with Uncle Ian?
Dave?
Are you still mad at us?
Dave?
"Dear fellas, I'm sorry, but....
You should go back to your real home in the forest."
I guess he really does want us to go.
I told you, Dave. I never lose.
Boys, welcome to your new home.
THEODORE: Wow! -Oh, yeah. Daddy's home. IAN: Yeah.
-Oh, yeah. Daddy's home. IAN: Yeah.
Can we play with all this stuff?
Sure, why not? It's your house.
So, what are the rules around here?
Oh, I do have one rule...
-...that there are no rules! -Cool.
SIMON: Four degrees elevation.
Six degrees azimuth.
Fire!
Prepare to face the fury of my vengeance.
Ha-ha-ha. Don't make me laugh.
SIMON: Pray for a quick demise, young chipmunk. Uppercut. Left. Fake-out, fake-out.
Your kung fu is no match for my rockets. Yah!
Sneak attack.
THEODORE: Okay, Simon. That's enough. I'm finished now. Simon.
-Hey, give me that. -Let go, Alvin.
Oh, come on. THEODORE: Whoa!
ALVIN: You had a turn. -Who says you get a turn?
ALVIN: You had a turn. -Who says you get a turn? ALVIN: Give me that.
Simon!
ALVIN: You got to try. -Get your mangy paws off of it.
-Scram. -I want it. Alvin, you don't decide.
-Why didn't the airbags deploy? -Theodore, don't go into the light.
-Whew! Let's do it again. ALVIN: Awesome.
-Playing hard? -Oh, yes.
Good.
Because tomorrow, you start working hard. Coast to coast in five days.
Well, Dave says that touring is no life for a kid.
For a normal kid. You guys are superstars.
-Yes. IAN: Which reminds me...
-Yes. IAN: Which reminds me... ...Simon, let's get rid of these boring glasses.
And try on these super cool in-the-now glasses.
Oh, my God, oh.
These would be great if I could see out of them.
Your eyes will adjust. Come on, boys. Let's hit the road.
ALVIN: Shotgun. -Hit the road.
Alvin-- Whoa!
Give me a big fella. Alvin, big, big.
No hiding. Come on, come on. Make love to the camera.
Sell it. Big smile. Yes. Theodore, chin out. Yeah. That's it.
Good stuff. There you go. Come on, get in there.
Strong. Give me some booty. Spank it. There you got it. Now you got it.
MAN 1: If the Chipmunks like Crunchy Nibbles, your pet will love them.
IAN: Here we are.
-Whoa! -Okay? All right?
Hold it.
We're not done. -You tell me. -Killing me.
-What do you want? -You are killing me here. There's no button I can push that wakes them to sing notes.
There's no button I can push that wakes them to sing notes.
You kidding? There's 5000 buttons here.
MAN: What button do you want me to push? IAN: Fine. I've got it.
All right, guys. Guess what your uncle Ian brought you. Coffee.
I love toffee.
No, it's coffee, Theodore, coffee. It's a-- Like a super cool energy health drink...
...with whipped cream and caramel and two pumps of chocolate.
Enjoy.
That ought to keep them awake.
-[SINGING] Get munk'd -Go, go, go

We need more dry ice. We need more, you know, wow. All right?
We need more dry ice. We need more, you know, wow. All right? We're the Chipmunks, for crying out loud.
This is absurd. I feel like P. Diddy with fur.
And to be honest, the new songs don't really sound like us.
Well, you know what I think? I think the new direction is perfect, you know.
It's all about today's edge.
Dave always said it was all about the music. [IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] "Dave always said...."
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You know what? Dave, Dave, Dave.
Dave is not here, okay? It's me.

Oh, is it dancing? Well, next time say, you know, "I'm the dance guy--" Hello?
Who? Dave Seville.
Name rings a bell. A dead...
...broken bell.
-Just let me talk to the guys. -I don't think that's such a good idea.
The boys are still stinging a little bit from you kicking them out.
-That's not what happened. -Denial.
So, what's this I hear about a European tour?
You're taking them away for six months?
Uh, no, 12 actually. If we can get China to go chipmunk.
Twelve?
Look, I just wanted to say hi. See how they're doing.
They're doing great. They're loving life.
They're doing great. They're loving life. Living large.
Face it, Dave. They've moved on.
-They're happy now. -Look, Ian, I wanna talk to them.
-They're happy now. -Look, Ian, I wanna talk to them. Put them on the phone.
Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen, Dave.
Got a world tour we're gonna start tomorrow. And these guys don't need the extra pressure.
-We'll send you a postcard. -Ian, you can't do this.
They're not ready for something like that. They're just kids.
-I'm gonna see them. -Look, Dave, I'm-- Wait.
-Ian? -Yeah? What? -Ian. -I can't--
Ian... ...was that Dave?
Uh, yes. Yes, it was.
He wanted me to let you know he's great and he's happy. He's really, really happy. So.... All right.
He's really, really happy. So.... All right.
And is he coming to the show?
You know what? I sent him tickets. And here's the thing, he sent them back.
Yeah, I know. I guess he's busy, you know. Got better things to do.
Hey, come on. What's with the long furry faces?
We're gonna have fun. We're gonna have a big show.
I'll tell you what, you guys like deep-tissue massage? All right?

If he shows up tomorrow night, he doesn't get near my chipmunks. -Got it? Okay. -Got it.

Uncle Ian?
-What are you doing here? -Can I sleep with you?
I had a nightmare.
Oh, you had a nightmare?

So is that a no?
Guys...

What do you mean? You are home.
No, I mean, "home" home.
You know, with Dave.
But, Theodore, come on. Wake up and smell the toffee.
Dave doesn't even want us. He doesn't care enough to even come to our show.
MAN [ON TV]: Here's Jillian Reynolds with today's entertainment news.
Too tired to rock? The Chipmunks might be. Rumor of exhaustion and voice strain are swirling around the singing sensation.

DOCTOR: Okay.
You three sound like you've been gargling nails.
IAN: Well?
I could give you a lot of fancy terms, but, bottom line, they're exhausted.
Okay, well, give them a shot or a cream or a pill or something.
I've invested every dime I have in these guys.
They need a long rest.
A long rest. Are you--? Okay. Yeah, a long rest, right. Uh....
Right, yeah. I'm not a doctor, so.... I'll get them that rest. Thank you. I'll take care of it.

Knock, knock.
So listen, guys, I just talked to the doctor.
And I don't feel right about sending you guys out like this.
So you're gonna cancel the show?
No. No, then I'd have to give out refunds.
No. What I'm talking about is having you guys lip-synch. Yeah.
Isn't that like cheating?
No, it's not like cheating. It's-- Cheating is wrong.
This is more like helping. Yeah, all the superstars do it.
Just make sure that you mouth the words exactly like we recorded them.
-Otherwise, people will know. -That we're cheating.
-No. -Guys, what other choice do we have?
Yeah. See? That's why he's the one with the letter.
Yeah. See? That's why he's the one with the letter. All right, guys, tighten up.
And remember, mouth the words and no one will know.
Love you.

Guys, with me.
[SINGING] Roll, that's how we roll

DAVE: Okay, Alvin, that's enough. ALVIN: Enough of what? Of being awesome?
DAVE: Alvin, I said that's enough.
ALVIN: Hey, look, Dave, no paws. Whoo-hoo!
Hey, if you guys behave, maybe I'll let you call me "Uncle Ian" again.
Deal?
No!
Claire.
-Hey. -Come on in.

Here we go, and sing.
Come on, sing for your uncle Ian. Come on, sing.
Why--? Why won't you sing?
[TV announcer] Yes, it's true. The master of midday TV goes prime time.
Talk show host Dr. RJ Stevens has popped the question to Bianca Kittles,
recent winner of Survivor: Kiribati.
What's good, family?
[TV announcer] The Doctor's show, with his irreverent guests...
I've been banging your sister.
[TV announcer] ...party-like atmosphere and his "Team of Me" philosophy...
-[RJ] The team of who? -[crowd] Me!
Rely on yourself.
[TV announcer] ...has gotten a significant ratings boost
since news of his impending nuptials became public.
This is, no doubt, welcome news to the ultra-competitive, glammed-out Bianca.
The TV reality star used every asset she possessed
to outwit, outplay and outlast the competition
on her quest for the million bucks.
It's a Q-rating bonanza,
as these two couldn't be more perfectly matched.
Life is good for the good doctor.
That was fabulous!
Honey, I'm so proud of you.
-Thank you. [chuckles] -You're such a star. -Isn't he a star? -[crowd applauds]
He is a superstar.
Now, that is how you announce your engagement!
[Marty] That was genius.
-[Marty] You're the talk of the town! -[woman] Hey, RJ.
Could you imagine this five years ago, bro?
[RJ] With a girl like that? Hell, no.
Hit show, big mansion on the block. Now, I'm international.
You look great, by the way.
Shit, man, that's all this tofu Bianca got me eating.
Besides the hunger pains, being a vegan is the shit.
-Cheers. -[Bianca] Honey! Telephone.
-[chuckles] -[Marty] Get going.
[Bianca] That sounds wonderful. I can't wait.
Great.
Oh, well, it's nice speaking to you. Okay, hold on.
It's your mom. Hurry up. Talk. We still have guests.
-Hi! -[woman] Hi there! [Bianca] You made it. Oh, my God. You look amazing! Gorgeous!
Hey, Mama.
Well, hello, stranger.
We're just beginning to think you just forgot all about us.
No, Mama. [chuckles] I can't forget my number one girl.
[RJ laughs over phone] And I didn't forget your anniversary, either.
I sent y'all a 50 inch plasma TV.
One inch for every year.
Oh, that's sweet, baby. But we'd much rather meet Blanca.
She sounds so nice.
[RJ] Oh, Bianca, Mama. Not Blanca.
[Mama J] Oh, I'm sorry. I thought it was Blanca.
Well, baby, you know it's our 50th anniversary.
Mama, um, I don't think we're gonna be able to make it. -[gasps] -Uh...
Jamaal, you know, he's got this big soccer game.
[RJ] The boy loves himself some soccer, Mama.
[Mama J] I know. He talks to Papa all the time.
Jamaal and Daddy have been talking?
Mm-hm. And writing letters.
[Mama J] Lord! You know, we haven't seen that child since he was a baby.
You've just got to come. Everybody's coming.
We got Ellie and Cleavon, Clyde and Lucinda and--
-Lucinda? -[Mama J] Oh, yes.
-Lucinda and Clyde? -[Mama J] Mm-hm.
-They're coming together? -[Mama J] I forgot to tell you.
But I... I thought...
[man speaking over phone] That's a lot of questions, boy.
Hey, Daddy.
Especially from someone who has shown very little interest in his family.
Yes, sir, but I...
If you can find the time to explore The Mind Of A Stripper,
or Sisters Gone Wild with your so-called "family,"
then you can find the time to spend with your actual family.
So you've been watching!
Boy, don't disappoint your mother.
[RJ] Go, Jamaal!
There you go, there you go! Right. Move. Push it!
Right there!
Let it go, Jamaal!
[RJ] That's a winner, Jamaal!
Jamaal, way to go. Woohoo! Way to go. That's how you do that.
Whoo! That's my boy. That's my boy.
That's a lot of running for one goal. But, hey, at least you hit it. [chuckles]
Dad, you should come more often.
Hey, I'm here.
Dad, why don't you want to go to Dry Springs?
[grunts] Come on. Not you too.
Papa Jenkins says Dry Springs is awesome.
He said all my cousins will be there and I'd have a lot of fun.
Oh, really? What else do y'all talk about?
I don't know. School, my friends, soccer, global warming.
Global warming?
We talk about a lot of stuff. He's really cool.
-[Jamaal] Can't we please go? -[sighs]
I'll think about it, Jamaal.
[Jamaal] Oh. Talk it over with the boss, first.
Boss? [scoffs]
Son, men run things in a relationship.
And between us men...
never let a woman tell you what to do, and how to do it.
Your dad is in complete control.
-[RJ screaming] -[Bianca] Who's in control?
-[RJ screaming] -[Bianca] Tell me. Who's in control?
-I don't know! -Take me higher, you can do it!
-Oh, no. -[Bianca] Come on.
Take me harder! -[Bianca] Come on, lover! -Mama!
-[demonic voice] Yes! -Oh, shit!
[demonic voice] Push it! -What the hell are you... -Yes!
[Bianca] Oh. Speaking in tongues. That's a first.
Oh, I'm so proud of you. [smooches]
[Bianca] I want to look hot for your family.
-[hisses] -So now, time for my seven miles.
Can you untie me first?
Babe?
Babe! Babe...
[sighs] It's all done. I booked the tickets.
Honey, I'm hearing a tinge of doubt in your voice.
I'm cool. You know, it's... It'll be four days, then we get back to our lives.
It'll be four days, then we get back to our lives.
Exactly.
This will solidify our union to the world.
We'll tape your parents' banquet,
you make a heartfelt speech, and the ratings?
Oh, my God!
-[Bianca sighs] -Yeah.
"Country boy done good, returns home with his Survivor queen."
[RJ chuckles] Hey, my audience will dig that.
-[chuckles] -See? That's why I love you.
Baby, I've dated all kinds of men.
Athletes, CEOs, princes, bad boys,
Athletes, CEOs, princes, bad boys, attorneys, mob bosses--
No, I get... I get it. I get that.
But... I've never connected with any of them the way that I do with you.
RJ Stevens. Mm.
Team of Me.
Hmm, your very words helped me win Survivor, and they brought me right to you.
and they brought me right to you.
-They did, didn't they? -Uh-huh.
-[chuckles] -See? We connect.
-Yes. -We're winners.
-Mm-hm. -And you? You're the man.
-I am the man. -Mm-hm.
Say it louder.
-I'm the man. -Say it louder.
-I'm the man! -Yeah!
[Bianca] Honey, don't ruin your outfit.
Baby, men don't wear outfits. [grunts]
What do you have in these bags, anyway?
You went 39 days on a desert island with...
You went 39 days on a desert island with... With a toothpick and a thong.
[chuckles] I need options.
[RJ] Damn the options. I need room.
-I'd be happy to check that for you. -Hell, no!
-I'd be happy to check that for you. -Hell, no! -[chuckles] -[RJ] Um...
I had some bad experiences.
I'll just slip it in the captain's closet. Uh...
It's the safest place it could be.
-Let's get this party started. -[chuckles] Uh-uh-uh.
I got you beet juice.
-Come on, baby, I want to live a little. -Precisely.
-It's an excellent source of antioxidants. -[flight attendant] Your drink, sir.
-It's an excellent source of antioxidants. -[flight attendant] Your drink, sir. -Drink up. -[RJ sighs]

How does his bag get lost in a captain's closet?
-Explain that to me. -[man] Yes, ma'am.
-Where's your father? -He won't come out of the bathroom.
Honey, how do the pants fit?
You mean to tell me this is the only pair of pants

-Mm-hm. Should be here any minute now. -[chuckles]
I thought she was engaged.
-Uh-uh. -That ended a while ago, baby bro.
Yeah, that, man, no, she moved to Atlanta, man.
And that smooth nigga Clyde supposed to be hollering at her again.
What you mean "again?" He ain't never been with her. Never!
-Oh, lookie here. Little Hollywood man. -Ooh!
-"He's never been with her. Never!" -"Never!"
What, you look like you trying to throw your hat in the ring.
No, I'm just setting the record straight, bubblehead.
-[thuds] -Set the record straight on this.
-[Reggie exclaims] -[Otis] Now. Good God Almighty, I smell them funky ribs!
[Otis] Yeah, baby, they're good too. Here, baby bro. Now, I need your discriminate tongue to let me know if I'm still on track.
Now, I need your discriminate tongue to let me know if I'm still on track.
You know how I gets down.
Give him some bread and a Pepsi, right now!
Give him some bread and a Pepsi, right now! No, no, I'm cool. I'm gonna wait on the chicken.
Skinless.
-Why? You Muslim now? -Yeah, what the hell?
-You a Five Percenter? -[RJ] Nah.
I just adopted a low-fat, high-fiber diet. Bianca and I...
I just adopted a low-fat, high-fiber diet. Bianca and I... [Otis groans] "Bianca and I..." I know what it is.
[Otis groans] "Bianca and I..." I know what it is.
The black Paris Hilton done sissified you off the pig. That's what's up.
The black Paris Hilton done sissified you off the pig. That's what's up. -It ain't like that, O. -[Reggie] Bullshit!
-It ain't like that, O. -[Reggie] Bullshit! You on that Hollywood shit. Nigga, please.
Give me... Let me see this. You see this swine is fine, divine, sublime,
-and right on time. -Right on time!
-Man! Look at that. -Want some of this dipping sauce, baby?
-Man! Look at that. -Want some of this dipping sauce, baby? Yeah, go on. Go on, taste a little piece of that.
Yeah, go on. Go on, taste a little piece of that.
Don't be scared. You got on the Kwanzaa outfit now.
Don't be scared. You got on the Kwanzaa outfit now. Get down, like you live. Go ahead and taste a piece of that.
-[Reggie] Bite that. -Go on.
How about a piece, Nelson Mandela?
Stop being so scary, man.
Farrakhan ain't nowhere around here.
-[Reggie] Man! -What's up, man?
-[chuckles] -Come on! Uh. Uh... The Last King from Scotland. Look.
-With the Forest Whitaker eye. -[Otis laughs]
Wait, look. Put a little barbecue sauce on the dead eye.
-Might jump up out of there. -[Otis laughs]
-[Reggie and Otis laugh] -[Otis] Boy, you crazy.
Oh, yes, indeed, that's gonna be good! Stir that up for me, Bilante.
Now, in episode 11, did you have to pull your titties out?
I had to have that chocolate cake.
But you threw it up. On purpose.
Whether on Survivor or in life, I believe in winning at all costs.
That's why RJ and I are perfectly matched.
[laughs] Girl, you tripping.
-[Betty laughing] -You better mind out, Betty.
Come on now, Mama.
Roscoe and winning don't even go in the same sentence.
Only Clyde gets that distinction.
-Who's Clyde? -Oh.
I'm glad you asked.
Clyde is our cousin. He came to live with us once his folks went on to glory.
They became famous and left their child behind?
Bitch, are you crazy?
They was in a car accident. They dead. Goddamn!
-[Betty] Anyway... -[woman] Oh. ...Now Roscoe and Clyde was fierce rivals, though "rival" is not quite accurate,
...Now Roscoe and Clyde was fierce rivals, though "rival" is not quite accurate,
cause Clyde used to whoop Roscoe's tail in everything.
I don't know about "everything" now, Betty.
Everything, Mama!
-[ball thumping] -[Betty] Basketball.
-[Clyde] Game! -[Betty] Checkers.
-[thuds] -King me.
-[Betty] Chess. -[thuds] [Clyde] Checkmate.
-[Betty] Arm wrestling. -[grunts]
Oops. That was me.
-You're telling me RJ never won? -[Betty] Never.
That is, of course, until the obstacle course in 1985.
Obstacle course?
[Betty] Yep. It's a Jenkins' family tradition.
-[people cheering] -[Papa J] Have fun, now!
Clyde, Roscoe, we got our eyes on you!
[Betty] Clyde and Roscoe made a bet
that the winner would get to ask Lucinda Allen to the Spring Formal.
And who is Lucinda Allen?
[Betty] Only the most popular Southern belle to ever come out of these parts, the Spring Formal Queen that year.
to ever come out of these parts, the Spring Formal Queen that year. [Bianca] So what happened?
[Bianca] So what happened?
Girl, your man -took off like a house on fire! -[gunshot]
[Papa J] Come on!
[Betty] He moved through that obstacle course faster than a runaway slave. Doing it!
[Betty] Now, see, Clyde was right there with his skinny ass, baby, neck and neck.
He was trying to hold on until the end.
-[Betty] But old Roscoe... -Come on!
Old Roscoe broke that tape, baby.
He smiled so hard, I thought his cheeks would burst.
-Yes! -[people cheering]
[Betty] I ain't never seen Mama and Daddy so proud as that day.
[Betty] Now, all Roscoe had to do was claim the real prize.
-Lucinda? -Hey.
Will you go to the Spring Formal with me?
Oh, Roscoe, how sweet, but... Clyde just asked me.
Come on, Lucinda, let's get a strawberry soda.
-My treat. -[Lucinda] Okay.
Bye, Roscoe. Great race.
Bye.
[Betty] I felt bad for the boy.
[Betty] Now, nobody knew about the bet, so Clyde just beat him to the punch.
[Betty] Clyde and Lucinda danced all night long,
looking like eternal lovers.
And Roscoe looked like a hot mess.
And his date wasn't much better.
Lord Jesus!
But in typical Roscoe fashion, he snitched.
But that mess backfired.
Lucinda is a young lady, not some trophy you can win!
-I'm very disappointed in you. -But what about Clyde?
Clyde will be dealt with.
Now, drop your britches and bend over.
[Betty] But that Clyde... Oh, girl, he is a smooth operator.
All right, what have you got to say for yourself?
I let Roscoe win.
It meant more to him to beat me.
And it meant more to me to go out with Lucinda.
She's so beautiful.
I know you're disappointed.
And if my parents were alive, they'd be disappointed too.
But you're the only parent I got, Papa Jenkins.
So you do what you think is right. I'll understand.
Don't you ever let something like this ever happen again.
[whispers] What?
You understand?
Yes, sir.
[Betty] He went upstairs and cried like a baby.
Now, how you know Roscoe was crying?
-[sobs] -[Betty] Because all his hollering woke me up from a sound sleep. -[young RJ sobbing] -[laughs]
So, are they still an item?
They dated awhile, but you know,
They dated awhile, but you know, the Queen is too pure for the likes of Clyde.
the Queen is too pure for the likes of Clyde.
He needs a real woman.
-Betty, y'all are cousins. -Whatever!
Now, the point is, Roscoe ain't been the same since Clyde stole Miss Lucinda.
[chuckles] I think they call that "evolution."
RJ's clearly over any childhood crush.
-[Betty] Really? -Really.
Well, where do you think that "Team of Me" mess started?
-[chuckles] -All right, Betty, that is enough.
Okay, Mama, but I'm just saying--
Come on in this house before I pop you.
[Betty] Now, somebody help that white girl.
She getting eggshells in the tater salad. Help her.
[Mama J] Always running your mouth! You talk too much.
[Betty] Don't nobody want no crunchy-ass potato salad.
-And you put vinegar on these? -Yeah.
[RJ] You gotta market these, O.
-RJ! -Huh?
What the hell are you eating?
I'm not eating, baby, I'm tasting these soy ribs.
-You want some? -Ugh! Forget it, carnivore!
Why don't you tell me about Lucinda Allen?
-Oh. Oh, shit. -Oh.
-[RJ] Lucinda Allen? -That was a bad one.
Well, see, I... -[woman screams] -Baby, she's just, you know...
[screaming] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Hey, Clyde's here now!
Let me introduce you.
[Clyde] What's up, family?
-Hi! Hey there, baby. What's up, baby? -[Betty chuckles]
-You looking sharp. Look at you. Betty, you too much.
-[Otis] Clyde! -What's up, O? What's up, Big Law?
I see you ain't getting no bigger. Look at you, boy.
[Otis] Lucinda, what's up, baby?
-Oh, my God, hi! -[both chuckle]
Good seeing you, baby.
Hey, look at you, boy. Look. You sure you our relative?
[chuckles] Little Mexican.
[Clyde] I got a little something for everybody.
I stopped to pick up some red velvet cakes for the picnic.
From Cooter's Bakery in Tuscaloosa?
Well, you only get one golden anniversary, Mama J.
-[people exclaiming] -[Clyde] Uh-oh. [Clyde] There he is! What's up, Papa J? How you doing, man?
Is the fountain of youth around here somewhere,
or you been taking that Viagra?
-You better watch it. -[both chuckle]
-See, 'Cinda? -[Papa J] Lucinda!
I'm so glad to see you. Welcome home. Oh! Oh!
Now that's nostalgia for you, right there. Family spirit award goes to Roscoe!
Cross Colour Jones! Look at you, boy!
Still wearing Otis' hand-me-downs. Come here, man.
Well, the airlines lost my bag, so...
What's your excuse?
[chuckles] Man... Hey, man, this, that Tiger Hoods, man.
You know me. I get my nine holes in.
-[Clyde chuckles] -Roscoe Jenkins.
-Oh. -[chuckles] Oh, it's been ages.
-Oh. -Oh, wow, it's been so long!
Oh, um, Clyde, Lucinda, this is my fiancée,
-uh, my fiancée, uh... -Bianca.
-Bianca. -Bianca Kittles. How you doing? Sweeter than Skittles.
-Girl, you prettier in person. -Is that so?
You find somebody that say different, see if I don't slap them to sleep.
-And I don't even get violent. -It's my pleasure, Bianca. [chuckles]
-Wow, congratulations, you two. -The pleasure's mine. [scoffs]
What's up with that?
And, Lord, we thank you for the pork ribs,
as well as, yes, the coleslaw, and...
I hear what you're saying, but look, I gotta go.
Thank you! And we thank you for the sweet potato pie.
And, yes, for the scrumptious red velvet cakes from Cooter's...
We thank You, Lord! And they all did say...
[all] Amen!
We thank you for that beautiful benediction.
-[Otis] You mean long. -Otis!
Mama and I are just filled with joy.
So many friends and family have joined us on this very special occasion.
[Papa J] This woman has put up with me for five decades,
and I love her now more than ever.
Thank you, baby.
-[applauds] -[Otis] All right. Hear, hear, now.
[Betty] Clyde, you try some of this corn, baby? Mm-hm.
And don't you forget these rolls, cause I made them with you in mind.
-You butter the biscuits? -[laughs] You know I did.
-[Otis] Hey, Betty? Betty. -What?
He's your cousin, not a potential tip.
You know what, Otis? Okay? Shut up.
Now, I'm just glad to see him, that's all.
And, and... Okay, you too, queenie.
-Oh. Thank you, Betty. -Mm-hm.
So, Lucinda, I hear you two were high school sweethearts.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
Yeah. But you never forget your first love.
Ain't that right, 'Cinda?
-[Lucinda] Yeah, I guess not. -[sighs]
Look at her. Just as beautiful as ever.
You know, I'm gonna leave some of these hood-rats alone,
get real serious about making this girl Mrs. Stubbs.
You know, matter of fact... Otis, get me a broom right now. I'm gonna jump!
-[Otis and Clyde laugh] -Mazel tov! [Clyde] You know what I'm talking about, Otis?
Don't believe this one, okay?
He's more interested in jumping bones than jumping brooms.
Well, best of luck to the both of you. You make a great couple.
[coughs] Bullshit!
Betty!
Excuse me, y'all, I had a piece of celery stuck in my throat.
[Clyde] Well, you know, I admit it. I like to play.
But, after I get me a couple of more dealerships,
I will be King of the South, who will need his Queen.
Well, my king has a surprise.
RJ's having a professional camera crew film the anniversary banquet!
-[Bianca] Tell them, honey! -[people chattering]
Like my baby said, it was supposed to be a surprise.
A gift, really, you know. Uh, no big deal. Just a...
A gift, really, you know. Uh, no big deal. Just a... Just a little something special for y'all.
That's so sweet.
Wait a minute. Hold up. Nigga, you got some cameras hidden around?
-You done brought some cameras? -Reggie...
You got that shit hidden around here? Oh, y'all seen his show.
Roscoe be jumping out of bushes on little midgets.
-[Mama J] Midgets? -[all laugh]
Neglected albino children. Al-Qaeda leaders.
Neglected albino children. Al-Qaeda leaders. -[chants in Arabic] -Rice, chicken kebab, chicken falafel.
-[chants in Arabic] -Rice, chicken kebab, chicken falafel.
-[singing] -[chuckles] Boy, you crazy.
I'm telling you, they be scattering like roaches, like cops.
You gonna win a Emmy, and I'm voting for you.
Remember, son, this is a family celebration,
not some Hollywood production.
Yes, sir.
Oh, hell, it'll be all right, Papa J.
I'm sure old Roscoe gonna do the right thing.
I'm just glad to see your baby boy back gracing us with his presence.
-[scoffs] -[Clyde] You done good, 'Scoe.
You got a outstanding career, beautiful fiancée, great son.
You finally winning, man.
Don't even matter that you could never beat me at nothing.
Oh, shit! That's the button.
[RJ] What you trying to do, Clyde?
I'm trying my best to be a better man.
And you trying to drag me into a penis-swinging contest?
-[Betty] My goodness. -That definitely ain't no contest.
You a sad man, Clyde.
Your competitive edge imprisons you.
Feel good for what you've done, not for what you haven't.
The one loss you suffered at my hands is still a burden to you.
Get over it. I have.
That's the "Team of Me."
[whispers] That's right, baby.
Oh! And, uh, just for the record,
I'll beat you again. And worse.
[Clyde] Is that right?
Care to make it interesting? Little wager, perhaps?
For what? You'd just find a way to renege again, renigga.
[all] Oh. -I ain't never reneged on no bet. -You a damn liar!
-I ain't never reneged on no bet. -You a damn liar!
Oh, this is getting hot!
You know damn well what the hell I'm talking about.
You're a sore loser, and you stole what was mine.
Lemonade is good, Mama.
There it is. That bitch done made you tough, Roscoe.
You hungry as shit, but that bitch done made you tough!
-[door closing] -[RJ] What is wrong with you?
[Bianca] I can't believe you're still pining after the prom queen.
-We only said three words to each other! -Forty words.
And that Clyde, he's a smug son of a bitch.
No wonder he's a car salesman. He's slick and unethical.
Why the hell did you tell everybody about the camera crew?
They were gonna see them anyway.
And besides, we were losing ground. I had to make a move.
Bianca, this is not Survivor.
Oh, yes, it is.
[grunts] Look, baby, baby, baby. Listen. Listen.
[sighs] Let's not fight, okay? I'm sorry.
Lucinda was just a crush, but I moved on.
So you're over her?
How can I not be, with you as my lady?
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Yeah! Oh, baby.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Yeah! Oh, baby. All the time I spent here, I never got a little piece of nothing.
All the time I spent here, I never got a little piece of nothing.
No way. These walls are way too thin.
And plus, your family listens.
That's ridiculous!
Look, now, I want to speak in tongues. [speaks indistinctly]
Nope. Forget it.
Damn!
Think you so damn special.
I sent a plasma, you bought cake. Negro, please!
Hey, Roscoe, I didn't know you were still up.
-Hey, Lucinda, how you doing? -I'm great.
-Who you talking to? -[stammers] Nobody.
Well, actually, myself. I do that. You know, just practicing for the show.
You know, keep it fresh, you know?
Okay, I see. Can you take a break?
-Damn! -[chuckles]
-This cake is scrumptious. -I knew you'd like it.
So, you said your publicist introduced you?
Yeah. Well... Yeah.
We had her on the show after she won.
And, uh... We just sort of connected, you know?
Oh, so how does she and Jamaal get along?
Real good. You know, she got him eating right.
-Maternal stuff. -He's a great kid.
Oh, thank you.
So, you and Clyde?
Oh. Uh, no. He was a familiar face when I moved to Atlanta.
He's sweet, but your cousin's a player.
What happened to your engagement? Wasn't there some guy?
Are you keeping tabs on me, Roscoe Jenkins?
Well, no, no, I heard things. You know... Look at my ears.
You know, I heard... I heard it. You know I heard it.
[laughs] You stupid.
Oh, what did you hear? Huh?
That I went to school to find a husband, right?
See? Yeah, I did. I got engaged early.
I had the vision of having a two-income household,
three kids before 30, Sunday brunch with my homegirls.
-Sounds good to me. -Don't it, though?
-Sounds good to me. -Don't it, though? But the student loans never go away. You're still broke after grad school.
But the student loans never go away. You're still broke after grad school.
And he didn't want kids.
Ever.
So... dream deferred.
I feel you. [sighs]
Me and Jamaal's mom was a disaster. [scoffs]
I wasn't ready to be a parent, either. But he's my son.
Spoken like a true Jenkins man.
-You need to finish that cake. -[chuckles] Shit.
If I don't watch this figure, who will? [chuckles]
I could think of some takers.
Me too! Sign me up for that booty duty!
Hey, Reggie. We were just saying good night.
Hell, no, don't let me interrupt. Don't let me interrupt.
-Don't let him interrupt. -[Lucinda] Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.
I need to go home and see my parents. And I'll talk to you guys tomorrow, okay?
-Good night. -Good night.
Tell the truth. You got a woody, don't you?
Fool, if I had a woody, I'd flip this table over.
We was just catching up.
Your daddy don't want that plasma you bought.
I'll tell you that right now.
And it's a damn shame that it's just going to waste like that.
Just a TV, just sitting there, ain't gonna do nothing, man, is...
There's so many poor people down here that need...
Would you like that plasma, Reggie?
[stammers] I... Boy, I ain't lying. I could use it.
Would you like to have it?
Yeah! I'm gonna get it and freak it. I'm gonna have it right.
Not gonna happen.
-Just tight. That's just... -[woman imitates wailing]
Hey, Lone Ranger, it's time to saddle up.
-[slaps] -Uh-oh. Gotta go.
Hi-yo, Silver! Off to the ATM machine!
It's gonna be a long weekend.
[farts] Excuse me.
[farts louder] Oh, excuse.
Baby, my Downward Dog is fine.
Your alignment's off. Watch me.
Damn, you are flexible!
Good morning, Reggie. Good morning to you! What's up, 'Scoe?
Good morning to you! What's up, 'Scoe?
Fuck you looking at, Reggie?
You wanna glue your eyes back into your head, now?
Oh, my fault. I didn't mean to look, but I was just checking out the pose, man.
-Hey! -That is nice. That's hot. That is so hot.
-Can I help you with something, Reggie? -Oh, your bag is here.
You couldn't just say that from Jump Street.
I was distracted,
cause it looked like somebody hit you in the face with a sack of nickels.
Well, maybe a foot in your ass will help you focus, huh?
Maybe a slice of red velvet cake will help you focus.
Man, get your look and move on. One look.
-That's it. One. One! -One more, one more, one time.
-That's it. Move on! -Oh, my God. Damn, 'Scoe!
-That's it. Move on! -Oh, my God. Damn, 'Scoe! [Bianca] Namaste.
Oh! Hey. Reggie's got a Frank Aaron jersey too, baby.
That's Hank, baby. And mine is a limited edition.
Reggie wouldn't even know where to look for one.
Oh, it's your world, player.
I'm just a squirrel trying to get a nut, if you know what I mean.
Man, you need to get her pregnant soon. Come on, Bucky, let's go.
My God. Did you see that?
Yeah. That's my jersey, ain't it?
Come on, Jamaal.
-I don't think I'm cut out for softball. -Don't be such a girl about it.
Jamaal, forget all that. You a natural.
Plus, this was your dad's sport. All right?
The main thing is to relax and keep cool. Just like your dad.
[RJ] Come on, we got them, we got them! We got them, we got them!
We got them!
-[groans] -[man] You out, sucka! -Damn it! -[Otis] Good throw, Betty!
-Damn it! -[Otis] Good throw, Betty!
How could this fool steal everything but third?
Cause I got a cannon in this arm, boy! A-Rod ain't stealing on me.
Damn, I'm a thief. I don't never get caught stealing.
Can't steal third, brother, not around here. [stammers] My shirt!
[stammers] My shirt!
-Go home, man. -Yeah, my fault. -This ain't authentic, is it? -[chuckles]
-Where does that child think she is? -I don't know.
-But I bet that come with paint remover. -[Mama J] Good God!
[RJ] Jamaal! Widen your stance, son. Keep your eye on the ball.
[RJ] Jamaal! Widen your stance, son. Keep your eye on the ball. -Choke up on the bat. Focus. -Okay.
-Choke up on the bat. Focus. -Okay.
[Betty] Do what your father told you.
Now, don't be scared of Callie. I know she's big.
We all big. That's why you in question.
[RJ] Jamaal! Focus.
[Otis] All right, it's 0 and 2. Come on, Jamaal.
-Strike three! -[Mama J] That's all right, baby.
-[Mama J] That's a good try. -Ugh. God, this kid's pathetic!
[Mama J] You're making Grandma proud.
-[Papa J] Good try, Jamaal. -[Betty] No, no, it wasn't, Daddy.
Now, what is he, Roscoe? One of them meatless people?
[Betty] Is he one of them vegans or vogans, whatever?
You need to feed that child, Roscoe. That's what's wrong with him!
-Good one, Callie! -[spits]
[Betty] Can't understand nothing. He's dumb in the brain.
[Betty] Come on, Roscoe! Hit one for Mama!
-All I need you to do is make contact. -I got this.
You got a strikeout a-coming if you ain't careful.
You's got a strikeout coming if you ain't careful.
"Boy, you's go--"
[Otis] Y'all don't take the smile for a weakness all the time, okay?
-[Reggie] I've never thought that. -Y'all think I'm weak or something.
-No, I don't think you weak. -Okay.
-Don't. Okay. -I thought you was Uncle Ben.
Hey. Take a seat. Let me get this, right here.
All right. That's what I'm talking 'bout, now!
Let the games begin! Come on, baby!
-What the hell you think you doing, Clyde? -I'm about to strike you out, player!
I've got a narrow strike zone, boy.
Oh, that's all right, Papa J.
Anything wider than Roscoe head would be unfair.
-[all laugh] -Everybody sit down. Have a seat.
Take a load off. Get comfortable. Don't worry about it.
Bring the La-Z-Boys out here or something. Come on, boy.
Bring the La-Z-Boys out here or something. Come on, boy. I got this, right here.
I got this, right here.
What's up, 'Scoe? You ready?
You want to be in the big time? Here we go, yeah.
Right here, baby!
Strike!
[chuckles] That's better than air conditioning right there, boy.
[babbles] Feel that breeze?
-[Betty laughs] -Come on, Roscoe!
They just talking smack, baby. You can do it, baby!
Focus, RJ! Come on. Get a hit!
Whoa. "Focus, RJ!" [chuckles]
All right, everybody good?
Betty, all right, give me a little something.
[Betty] Okay.
Okay, I got you. Good to go. All right, cool, cool, cool.
Right here.
Crush it! Kill it!
-[screaming] You hit my mama! -Mama!
-Mama J! -[Mama J] Oh, Jesus.
[Papa J] That done knocked the wig off and everything. Damn!
[RJ] Get off me about it right now.
-[Otis] Really? Get off you about it? -That's right.
Yeah, okay? Stop sweating me about it.
I was trying to tell you to wait on the flutterball.
You up there swinging like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,
now my mama got a red titty on her head.
She's my mama too, O.
We don't know that. You could be adopted.
Look, I gotta get the fish. Meet me at Monty's. Can you do that?
Mama, I'm sorry. Really sorry, Mama.
I know, baby. Mama will be all right.
Mama, I was trying to hit it out the park. I didn't know it was going that way.
Mama, I was trying to hit it out the park. I didn't know it was going that way. I'm getting my headache, baby. Be quiet.
-Daddy... -Son...
-Daddy... -Son... We all make mistakes.
We just have to learn from them.
Though I don't know what you learn by giving your mama a concussion.
-[police car's horn honks] -[officer] Hey, Big O!
I don't know how you take it down here, O.
[scoffs] Man, you was the best linebacker in the state.
If it wasn't for your knee injury, shoot!
Man, you'd be in the NFL, living in a mansion, driving a Benz.
[chuckles] Yeah, that's good, man.
But it wasn't in God's plans for me.
God's plan is cool, but you needed the "me" plan.
Oh, man, stop talking that bullshit. I ain't no failure. I'm a king.
[Otis] I got a great family.
I live in a great community that I love and that loves me back.
-You the failure. -How do you figure that?
[chuckles] I made it.
Oh, why? Cause you got some money? Cause you on TV?
-[Otis] What else you got to show for it? -Everything I ain't have growing up.
What you ain't have that was that important?
Hey, why don't Jamaal know how to play baseball?
You used to love to play, and you was halfway decent.
Man, I ain't got time for all that. Besides, Jamaal only loves soccer.
I think Jamaal would love whatever sport his father showed interest in.
[scoffs] Oh, so you a parenting expert, now?
Man, all I'm saying is... [thuds] Don't let money raise your kids.
Well, don't let cornbread and chitlins raise yours.
What you looking at me like that for, O?
Yeah, I said it. Why you approaching me?
I just didn't hear you.
I said what you looking at me like that for? Ain't nobody scared of you.
What'd you say before that? Don't let what?
Don't let chitlins, cornbread, ham hocks,
cheese sticks or none of that raise your kids.
That's what I said.
What, you got hostility? [stammers] What's happening?
This ain't your little brother no more, O. I'm a grown man.
You know, I don't get ass whoopings, I give 'em out.
-Mm-hm? -You a officer here in Mayberry.
Come on. What you carry? A flashlight and a baton?
A'ight, tell you what. Maybe...
If you a good old boy, I hire you as my security.
Yeah, I got the pull. I can do it. [chuckles]
-Big-ass... -[bangs]
Now you and Mama got matching titties.
Maybe y'all are related.
You know, you should do a show about scrawny little brothers
that constantly get bitched. [laughs]
Look at your head!
Yeah, but thank you. But my next show gonna be about prison hoes...
Yeah, but thank you. But my next show gonna be about prison hoes... Oh.
...who mask conjugal visits as Bible readings.
Uh-uh. Yeah, it's gonna be called "Bible Thumpers" or "Bible Humpers?"
Yeah, it's gonna be called "Bible Thumpers" or "Bible Humpers?"
You available? [laughs]
You got time? [laughs]
-[keys jangling] -What you feeling?
Oh. Oh, okay. You better get your Butterfinger-eating ass back in the car.
I may not hit a woman, but I'll beat a bitch's ass.
-Is that what you gonna do? -Yeah.
-That's what you gonna do? -What?
-You gonna beat a bitch's ass? -[groans]
What bitch you gonna beat, 'Scoe? What bitch you gonna beat?
Maybe that's what it's like? Is that what it's like?
Hold up. What bitch you gonna beat, 'Scoe?
-You snapped my neck. -Look out! You didn't know. Golden glove.
Watch. I'm gonna give you a dirty, South-ass whipping, boy!
-[RJ groans]! -Come on, come on! Bring it back! Bring it back, punk!
[Betty] Roscoe, get your damn... Get off of me, 'Scoe!
[Betty] That ain't weave, fool! Oh, you gonna be sorry!
-[bangs] -[RJ grunting] Oh! -[thuds] -[Betty] Wait a minute! [Betty] You done pulled out my damn tracks!
-[both grunt] -What you gonna do, RJ? [snaps]
I'm sick of you! I'm sick! Say you sorry. Say uncle.
I'm sick of you! I'm sick! Say you sorry. Say uncle. -Say uncle! Say uncle! Say it! -[grunts]
Talk your shit now, you fake-ass Bruce Lee!
-[groans] -You wanna get up? You wanna get up?
Come on, come on. I done told you about your mouth!
[Betty] I am not a ho!
I am doing God's work! Say, "Praise the Lord!"
Now I'm gonna tell you something. You'd better be glad I'm a good Christian.
Cause the next time, I might not be so merciful.
You done made me lose my protection from the Lord.
Father God, forgive him, for he know not what he do.
I'm gonna pray for you, Roscoe.
Thank you, I pray... [grunts]
[RJ] Hey, Lucinda.
Oh, my God! Roscoe, are you okay?
What do you mean?
Well, your face looks like you got run over by a tractor.
Really? I feel fine.
Well, it looks terrible. Here, sit.
-[RJ chuckles] -Oh, my God.
-Here. -[RJ] Oh.
Ah! That feels good.
Good, good.
Hey. It might be a good idea to stop teasing everybody.
This is nothing. [chuckles]
-Why you trying to front? -I'm not fronting.
-[groans] Oh, oh. -See? See? -[RJ sighs] -You know you're hurting.
The Roscoe Jenkins I knew would've owned up to it.
Well, this is RJ Stevens you're tending to now, girl.
Yeah, the new and improved... Roscoe 7.0.
I think Roscoe 1.0 was just fine.
-[Papa J] I didn't know you're back. -We weren't doing nothing!
Nothing much, that is.
Well, good. -Why don't you give me a hand, Roscoe? -Papa J, I thought you wanted me to help.
-Why don't you give me a hand, Roscoe? -Papa J, I thought you wanted me to help.
No, that's all right. Roscoe's got this.
Yeah, I got this.
[Papa J] Son... You are ready to get married, aren't you?
[chuckles] Of course! Yeah. Yeah. Why do you ask?
Well, if I didn't know any better,
I'd think there's something going on between you and Lucinda.
Oh, no! [chuckles] I'm just, you know...
[stammers] We're just catching up.
Daddy, the wedding is gonna be hot. [chuckles]
Got the caterer, R. Kelly's singing. Beyoncé is gonna choreograph the Electric Slide.
Beyoncé is gonna choreograph the Electric Slide.
-[RJ] Um... -Roscoe... I think you know what I'm saying.
The marriage isn't about the wedding day.
Your mama and I got married right out there in the front yard.
I know, but...
Well, Bianca wants a big wedding with all the trimmings.
Is that what you want?
[stammers] Yeah, I think.
I do. I do.
-How does Jamaal feel about that? -[sighs]
Jamaal, he... Jamaal's cool, Daddy.
Be mindful of that boy.
He never sees his own mother.
From what he tells me, he doesn't see much of you, either.
I'm trying, Daddy.
All right, but the show keeps me so busy-- Oh! The show.
Oh! The show. Team of Me.
I never quite understood that.
Well, it's just... It's just a saying, you know?
"Protect yourself. Be your own man."
Well, that's fine, son, but...
there are times you gotta depend on others, family and friends.
I mean, you never learned anything like that around here.
And that's certainly not something you teach a child.
Some kids learn it on their own, Daddy.
-Honey! -[grunts] I've been busy with a personal project all morning and I'm exhausted, so...
I've been busy with a personal project all morning and I'm exhausted, so...
Be a dear and walk Fifi for me?
Come on, baby. Let Feef run around and enjoy nature.
Come on, baby. Let Feef run around and enjoy nature. -[Fifi pants] -I was hoping to get a little nap.
-[Fifi pants] -I was hoping to get a little nap.
My little man is tired.
Well, I promise I'll do any little thing you want if you do this little thing for me.
I'll do any little thing you want if you do this little thing for me.
Plus, I want to show you my little project.
What project?
Damn! [gasps]
-Are those my initials? -[Bianca] Mm-hm.
I told you it was yours.
[chuckles] You're a hell of an artist, baby.
Come on, Feef!
Come on, Feef, go pee.
Oh, shit! Snake! Feef! Come on, Feef! -[Fifi whimpering] -Run, Fifi!
-[Fifi whimpering] -Run, Fifi! [RJ] Run! Come on!
-[grunting] Come on! Hey! Lucinda... -Hey, what's the matter?
Don't go down there. Fifi's cornered by this big-ass poisonous snake.
-And you left her? -No! Lucinda! Save yourself!
-[Lucinda screaming] -Oh! You see? I'm sorry, Fifi!
I ain't sucking out no... No poison!
You okay, girl? Yeah? You just got a little scare, huh?
[chuckles] Fifi...
It's okay. It's all right.
-She all right? -Yeah.
-Oh. -Here you go. -See? It was just a little milk snake. -Ah!
[sighs] Now, that wasn't the snake I saw.
-It was an anaconda or a python. -Well, we don't have those down here.
-For real? -Uh-huh.
There you go.
[sighs] You want to take a walk?
Sure.
[RJ] You out here running off that red velvet cake, huh?
-[Lucinda] I deserve some cake. -[RJ] Yeah, no...
[RJ] Oh, come on, you heard the stories. Hell, you witnessed a bunch.
Everybody did everything better than me.
So, I found something I'm good at.
I get in front of that audience and they feel me.
More than anyone here ever did.
Please, Roscoe. What family doesn't mess with one another?
I mean, I got teased to no end about my skinny legs.
Yeah, well, you do have some slim-jims.
Shut up! You could pick your teeth with those legs.
-[RJ chuckles] -[laughs] Shut up.
See? You can dish it out, boy. Especially when it comes to Clyde.
Clyde. [scoffs]
Clyde's big-headed ass needs to be knocked off his high horse sometimes.
Why are you two always digging at each other?
Because Clyde is dirty, and will use any underhanded trick to win.
Aren't you exaggerating just a little?
Uh, no.
And what was all that "you stole what was mine" business? -Mm? -At the picnic. What did he steal?
-Mm? -At the picnic. What did he steal?
A great opportunity.
Well, if it was that great, why can't you create another one?
Maybe I will.
Maybe you should.
[Reggie] Well, well, well. Here y'all are again!
Caught you, didn't I? Mamma gonna get ya. Uh-huh.
[Reggie] This raises some eyebrows.
Well, sing like a canary, Reggie. Whistle.
Well, sing like a canary, Reggie. Whistle. [sings] All that with the birds.
[sings] All that with the birds. Harmonize with 'em. But you're not getting the plasma.
Harmonize with 'em. But you're not getting the plasma.
I was walking the dog.
How's that? Bucky's with us.
-I'm talking about Fiona. Where is Feef? -Oh, I think she's down by the gully.
-Where's Bucky? -Down by the gully.
-[Reggie] He's gonna tear it up. -[Bucky howling]
-Bucky, get your ass off! -[thuds]
Oh, my God.
-She is so working him. -[Fifi yelping]
Don't be surprised if he starts barking in tongues.
-[sighs] -Bucky done turned the bitch out.
-Reggie, not a word. -I got you.
Is that plasma TV under warranty?
I'm a steel trap, player. That dog gonna need counseling.
-You gonna be all right? -Maybe she won't notice.
Oh, baby. [chuckles] Me and Fifi had so much fun out there, we completely lost track of time.
Me and Fifi had so much fun out there, we completely lost track of time.
Yeah... Daddy loves himself some Fifi. Isn't that right, Fifi?
[RJ] Daddy loves his little Fifi! Yeah!
[RJ] Daddy loves his little Fifi! Yeah! Oh, we was running all over the place, baby. [chuckles]
Yeah, she may need a bath.
She got dirty. Real dirty.
Now see here, buster.
Your alliance is with me, not the prom queen.
Oh, come on, baby. There's no other alliance. All right?
Now, how about you show me that little project?
-I shaved off my little project. -Why'd you do that?
If I discover there's a mutiny afoot,
I'm gonna shave off your little project. Understand?
Damn!
-Damn! -Damn!
[man on TV] One timer! Kaberle.
-Goal! -[all laugh]
-Goal! -[all laugh] Dang, you got game, nephew. It's all right.
Hey, Dad!
Roscoe Malley! What's up, man?
So I heard you been running around with my girl again. Come on, man.
Let's play the game. Me and Junior take on you and Jamaal.
-Yeah. -I don't play children's games.
Oh, is that right? Then what's your poison, brother? [chuckles]
-[rattling] -[Clyde] Ya hear that, though. Huh? You like that, eh? Yeah, I've been dying to play a little click-clack.
You like that, eh? Yeah, I've been dying to play a little click-clack.
Sure you want to take it there, Clyde?
Cause I don't play for fun.
Ain't no fun losing money.
Then you're about to have a bad time.
-[both exclaim] -Seven! Oh, that's gonna be all day right there!
-[RJ] Can you handle it? -Money maker! Money maker! Daddy needs a new pair of gators.
Uh-uh. Watch this right there.
Talking about shake 'em up, shake 'em up, wake 'em.
-Oh! -Yeah, Dad!
Daddy, yes!
You know what, man? I admire you.
-Yeah? -I admire you, Roscoe.
I mean, do you still keep trying.
You know, cause even when I lose, I win. -Ooh. -Ooh.
Well, then this must feel like the championship,
cause you're losing the grip. Bitch! [laughs]
-Right there. Right there. -Come on, baby, eat for Mama.
Uh, Binata?
You're not listening. Now, I told you to take that dog out of my kitchen.
It just ain't sanitary! What's wrong with people?
Bringing damn dogs up in folks' kitchen? Don't make no damn sense.
That ain't nothing, you ain't even slick with yours, so that's the problem.
Everybody see what you're doing, man. But she mine, bro.
-Yeah? -Well, you might want to tell her that,
cause she's feeling a brother.
Seven again! [laughs]
All right, grease is hot, I need that fish.
-[Ruthie] Here you go, baby. -Thank you.
Hmm. It's a little sweet, but it's delicious.
Yes! And that wine of yours, baby, set it right off!
-The '67 Margaux? -Yeah!
-That's a $600 bottle! -And worth every penny! [clinks]
Seven again!
Oh! Somebody stop it!
-Come on, roll the dice. -[RJ laughs]
I get it. That's mine, that's mine.
Pass on that ass.
-Oh! -[all] Oh! -Could it be? -No, no.
-Could it be? -No, no. No, no. I call gator on that right there.
No, no. I call gator on that right there.
Nigga, this ain't Monopoly.
Hey, hey, man! Roll again, bro.
Clyde, you better un-ass me before you find yourself a pinky short.
You better roll again before you find yourself an artery short.
You brought it on yourself! You brought it on yourself, Clyde!
-Let's go get some fish. -[Callie] Okay. Come on, Jamaal.
Is this what you wanted, Clyde? That's what you want.
-[both grunt] -[RJ] Oh!
That's right! That's right! That's Junior Varsity right there, bro!
-[RJ] Feel that? -That's your ass right there!
[Callie] Hey, stop.
Y'all better stop all that running through my kitchen!
-[RJ] Got you! Yeah! -[Clyde grunts]
Oh! You broke Daddy's table! We worked hard on this!
-[thuds] -That's cause you fixed it!
[Amy] I said, why are you drinking when you're pregnant?
-They said I could have a glass of wine. -Really?
They didn't say how many times you could refill it, though, baby.
I want to be pregnant!
-How about another one? -Let's do it, Balolo!
-[RJ] Clyde-o-mania, baby! -[groans]
You ended up with a big dog now, boy. You ought to check my dental records.
Lord, these fools been playing dice.
-[indistinct chatter] -[Mama J] Stop them. Hey, knock it off!
Ladies, get the tartar sauce and the hot sauce,
cause the Jenkins family is about to throw down!
[shouting] Man, what are y'all doing?
-Stop that! -[women clamoring]
-[Lucinda] RJ no! -It's hot! It's hot!
-[Otis] Oh, hell no! -[Ruthie] Oh, my God.
[Amy] Are you okay?
Oh, my God.
-He started it. -He started it.
[Reggie] What they heading for now? What they heading for now...
Damn! Poor Mama.
You should have had more prenatal care. Look at your kids.
I'm sorry.
Baby, I'm sorry.
-It was an accident. -Silence.
-It was an accident. -Silence. Shower, strategy. That's all I need right now.
Shower, strategy. That's all I need right now.
Oh! Boy, the shower is all yours.
-You used all my shit! -Yeah, what?
-And you're wearing my robe? -What?
-Now, you little-- -Bianca, how's Fiona doing?
-She still spooked by that snake? -What snake?
[Reggie] The snake Lucinda saved Fifi from.
I mean, she seems pretty relaxed. That's probably cause...
-Satellite! -Huh, 'Scoe?
Satellite, pay-per-view, premium channels, sports channels, platinum titty channels... All that, man.
-Playboy channels? -Yeah, butt-naked channels.
-Playboy channels? -Yeah, butt-naked channels. -You like butt-naked? -Oh, I got to have it.
-You like butt-naked? -Oh, I got to have it.
You like when they butt-naked, showing all ass?
-You know it. Gospel channels? -Yeah, you... Gospel, all that!
-Telemundo? -[RJ] You like Telemundo?
-I like Tele... I like Spanish. -[speaks indistinctly] All that!
All the... [sings tango music]
My man. Peace.
I don't know who you are anymore, Roscoe Jenkins.
Baby, it's me.
It's RJ.
Are you really willing to put your career, your future in jeopardy over a crush?
Career? Baby, we're getting married.
Get your priorities in order and decide what and who you really want.
Let that simmer while you sleep on the couch tonight.
-[Bianca] We're going to take a shower. -[chuckles]
-Reggie! -Ugh! Hell, no!
-Get your nasty ass outta here! -I didn't know that was you.
-Get your nasty ass outta here! -I didn't know that was you. You knew I was in here! You is a nasty common freak!
You knew I was in here! You is a nasty common freak!
There is a naked linebacker in our shower right now.
You done brought that little white gal up in here,
now you trying to sneak around and see some black meat?
Girl, ain't no. I didn't try to come here and look at you!
Well, then hand me my feminine wash!
I can see why you can't keep a man now.
You got to lay off them Milky Ways and Doritos and tortillo chips.
Your mother shouldn't have did them goddamn drugs
Your mother shouldn't have did them goddamn drugs when she was pregnant with you! That's what's wrong with your black ass!
when she was pregnant with you! That's what's wrong with your black ass!
God, your titties are huge, Betty.
Look, I'm gonna tell Daddy.
I'm gonna tell my daddy that you are in here
I'm gonna tell my daddy that you are in here trying to see my treats, Reggie.
You're gonna be lying if you tell him that!
-Then what was you doing in here? -I thought that...
-Then what was you doing in here? -I thought that... Can I give you this bubblegum and get on out of here?
What? You wanted Chick-fil-A, that's what you got. I'm Burger King. I'm a Double Whopper. You want to see this dark meat?
I'm Burger King. I'm a Double Whopper. You want to see this dark meat? I don't play that foolishness. You're sick.
I do want to see the black meat, but I don't want to see a bundle of it.
Get out of here, you sick nasty bastard!
[RJ] She gonna put me out of my room.
She's a survivor. I'm a survivor! Kiribati, my ass!
Good night, vegan! [laughs]
Finally, peace at last.
Bucky!
You stinky dog! Bucky!
Oh, hell no!
He done pissed in my eyes!
He done pissed in my eyes! It stinks! My eyes! It burns! [screaming] Oh, Lord! Oh! Oh...
It stink. It stink. My eyes are burning. It got in my mouth!
It stink. My eyes are burning. It got in my mouth!
[RJ] They're burning!
Where did I go wrong with that boy?
[RJ] Mama! Mama! Mama!
Lord have mercy.
-[RJ] Mama! -[Papa J grunts]
[woman whispering] Hell, no, that ain't me.
-What the... -[spraying]
Come on, baby brother. Ease up, man. You got my eyes tearing.
-My skin is all itchy. -[sprays] [whispering] Don't do that, man!
Smells like garbage truck juice out here.
-[Papa J] Today... -[spray whooshes]
...you all continue the Dry Springs obstacle course tradition.
So get out there and display that Jenkins family athletic prowess!
And, no matter what... -Have fun! -[all cheer]
Good luck, young man. Make me proud.
-Win something. Have fun. -Go on, have a good time.
Jamaal, nobody remembers who came in second, okay?
So you gotta get pumped, right? Loosen up.
Loosen up your muscles. Come on, loosen up! Come on, come on!
-Win! Win! We're winners. We're winners. -Ease up now, Kiribati.
Jamaal, go. This ain't none of your business, Clyde.
Look, come on, man. This is just kids having fun.
It ain't no fun getting beat. You should know that, Cadillac man.
Hey, that was one time! Even a blind squirrel can find a nut.
Who are you calling a squirrel?
"Who are you calling a squirrel?"
Roscoe, that's who! A blind, stink-ass squirrel.
-And you the nut. Koo-koo! -[Bianca gasps]
Hey, leave my lady out of this.
I know you're not calling my victory a fluke.
Oh, fluke, luck, one in a million shot, yeah.
Well, bring it on, Clyde. We can do this right here, right now.
He's always been a loser. He's always gonna be a loser.
Hey, Daddy! Daddy, you hear these fools? I'm gonna arrest them!
You two been at this for 20 years.
Go ahead. Knock yourselves out. Starting line, ten minutes!
-Oh, yeah? -Yeah, Daddy! Yeah!
Starting line, ten minutes, Clyde! Ten minutes. Ten minutes.
-Ten minutes, Clyde! -[Bianca] Get him!
Ten minutes to countdown, baby!
-Get it. Get it. -Gunfight at the O.K. Corral!
[Reggie] Oh, shoot, it's the Negro Olympics!
-Daddy, are you sure about this? -Focus, son. Concentrate.
Cut me in or cut it out! Clyde is favored to do the job!
[Reggie] Good luck, 'Scoe. -[Betty laughing] -That's right. Who gonna bet?
Y'all better strap yourselves in, cause this here's gonna be funny!
Hey, Reggie, let me get some of that action!
I got a pulled hamstring for Clyde and a back spasm for Roscoe.
RJ's in top shape. Your man? No shape.
-Clyde is not my man. We are just-- -Just friends.
Yeah. Like you and RJ?
-What are you talking about? -I've been watching you.
Trying to win favor with Jamaal. Realizing what you missed out on.
It's pathetic. And you're too late.
Cause there are no second chances for washed-up prom queens.
-Oh. [shushes] Now, that was painful. -Sorry. Sorry.
-Oh. [shushes] Now, that was painful. -Sorry. Sorry. You a bad bitch. You bad.
You a bad bitch. You bad.
[Lucinda] A bad bitch, Betty? Please, okay?
She is a fake celebrity, all right?
Her only claim to fame is trading her panties for peanut butter.
That's some nasty shit there.
News flash, honey. Those panties went for 20 grand online.
-Wait a minute, 20 grand for your panties? -[Bianca] Yes.
Well, wait, I got some panties, okay?
I got the good panties, I got the thong panties,
I got the period panties. They might--
Betty, I got a news flash for you.
-Bucky boned Fifi. -Oh, Lord!
-Well? -Did he kill her?
She was on top. -[gasps] -[Betty] The Pomegramian?
-[gasps] -[Betty] The Pomegramian?
-[Lucinda] Now that is a bad bitch. -[Betty] Oh, my God.
-Fifi! -Your dog's a whore!
All right. On your mark!
Get set!
Run, baby!
-Get out the way! -Oh.
[Reggie] What is wrong with them?
[Clyde] Oh, get back! Don't want nothing.
[Clyde] Oh, get back! Don't want nothing. -Hey, get back, sucka. -[man] Watch out! Hey! Get off me!
I got him! I'm going!
Oh, no! Share that! Share that.
Oh, no! Share that! Share that. -[RJ screams] -[Clyde] Time out!
-Redemption! Redemption! -Oh, no! No!
Forget it!
-You gotta go, Rasta boy! -[grunts]
-No! -Hey!
Cannonball!
Oh, shit!
Hit the floor, baby! G.I. Joe!
Navy Seal! Navy Seal!
Slip and slide, Clyde!
Try the South Beach Diet, fat-ass! Yeah!
-[screams] -Come on, baby!
-No, you don't! -Hey!
Oh, hell no! No! -[screams] -[laughing triumphantly]
Man, I felt that in my stomach.
-[Otis] Come on, baby! Let's go! -No! No! Hold on!
Son, no! Wait!
[Jamaal] Sorry, Dad!
You! You wait! You...
Hold on, baby! Hold on!
-[Betty] Go, Clyde, go! -[cloth ripping]
-That's all right, baby! -[Reggie] Look at them stretch marks!
-Let's go, Jamaal! You can do it! -[Otis] Go! Whoo! Yeah!
[screaming] No! -[Clyde] It's your ass! -Oh boy! No!
I got you now. See you at the finish line, boy.
-No! -Get up, baby! Get up!
-Yeah! -Yeah. You see that? Upper body strength.
That's what being in the gym will do for you!
Well, I'm a power runner. True warrior!
-Man! I ain't never scared! -Yeah, me, neither!
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!
[RJ] Mama! Mama!
[Betty] Go, Clyde, go!
Go, RJ! Get him!
-Help me, Dad! -Hey, come on!
-[Jamaal] Dad! -Dig in, come on!
-I can't! Help! Dad! -[RJ] Come on, son!
-Come on, Clyde, you can do it. -[Jamaal grunts]
Come on. Come on. Come on, son! Go!
-[Jamaal] I'm trying! -Dig in, son!
Hurry up! Dig in! Go!
Leave him, baby, leave him!
[Bianca] Don't let Clyde beat you! Don't let him win!
-[Jamaal groans] -[Bianca] Win, RJ, win!
-What? -What?
-[Bianca] Go, go, go! -[grunts]
[grunting] Don't give up, son! Don't give up!
[grunting] Don't give up, son! Don't give up! [Bianca] Go, baby, go!
Come on, baby! Go!
-[grunts] -Watch out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby.
-No... -No, that's all right.
This is just a mess.
[grunting] Oh, yeah, sucker!
Oh, no! Hell, no! Hell, no!
-Oh, no, you don't! No, you don't! -[crowd cheering]
Welcome to the top, winner!
Give it up, Clyde. I still got it.
This is gonna haunt your dreams for the next 20 years! Yeah!
-Loser! -Callie!
Built for comfort, not for speed.
Hey, good save, Steroid Stan! Good save, boy.
But you know what? Too bad this ain't a team competition.
You know why? Cause I'm the leader!
Yes! Captain of the Team of Me!
Just me! Just me, baby! Just me!
Come here, son.
No, thanks.
Jamaal! Jamaal!
Jamaal! Jamaal!
What in God's name is wrong with you?
[sighs] What? He challenged me, Daddy. So I stepped to the plate.
-What was I supposed to do, back down? -Hey, don't use that tone with me!
-Show some damn respect! -Where's my respect, Daddy? Damn!
You've never given me credit for nothing I done!
Credit for what? Winning a child's race?
Buying some fancy TV? Or that bullshit show of yours?
Yes! Yes, Daddy! Yes!
Yes! Yes, Daddy! Yes! Give me some credit! Show me some damn credit!
Then I feel very sorry for you.
So, Clyde gets off easy again.
It wasn't just me out there, Daddy.
I know he lost his father, but why did I have to lose mine too?
Why, Daddy?
Well, now I see why you stayed away for nine years.
Hey. Hey, Roscoe. Look, man...
I never tried to take your place.
I was just trying to fit in.
Cause even though we're cousins, you're my brother, man.
Oh, now you're Mr. Innocent? Please!
Don't fall for it, honey. He's just trying to suck you in.
Oh, look, heifer, your narrow ass about to get sucked in
-if something... -Hey, don't do this. You got a case.
-I will cut you. -You got a case pending.
[RJ] You know what? We're going.
-We're going. -I'm not afraid of her.
You need to be afraid of her. You don't watch Wild Kingdom?
You ain't never seen a lion attack a gazelle?
She about to smack the "Cover Girl" off your face.
-You better get up out of here. -[Clyde] 'Scoe. 'Scoe.
-Hey, look, man... -[Betty] Let him go. Let him go.
Get off of me, Reggie!
-Come on, baby. -[Betty] I can see your spine.
-Come on, baby. -[Betty] I can see your spine. [Betty] Look at that snake!
It was so good to see you, Jamaal. Yeah.
Don't you forget to stay in touch with your grandma and grandpa, you hear?
I will. Thanks, Mama Jenkins.
Well, here's something for the road.
-Meatloaf, your favorite. -Thanks, Mama.
Oh, I just hate to see you go. But I understand. Lord have mercy, I understand.
But I understand. Lord have mercy, I understand.
Just don't let it be another nine years, okay?
-Promise? -Yeah.
We love you.
I love you too, Mama.
[Bianca] Honey, don't be sad. I'm sorry things didn't work out.
I promise we'll fix this together.
-I hope so, baby. -We'll come up with a new plan.
Yeah, we have more time to work on the speech.
We'll film the banquet in LA, hire actors. It'll look better.
-Hire actors? To play my family? -Honey...
We're getting married and forming a powerful merger.
Where does your family fit into that?
I guess they don't.
-Dad, are you serious? -Jamaal!
Haven't you realized by now who your father's become? Hmm?
It's all about the Team of Me.
This is Team Stevens, and you need to get on board.
I'm a Jenkins.
RJ, please talk to your son.
She's right, Jamaal. -We gotta move forward, all right? -Mm-hm.
You think just because you bonded with everybody,
I'm gonna send you down here for summers and Christmases...
...so you can be influenced by these people?
-But... But, Dad! -No buts, Jamaal.
In fact, you know, let's not even invite them to the wedding.
[gasps] Oh, my God! I'm so glad you said that!
I've been thinking that ever since I met Betty. [sighs]
[scoffs] I don't blame you. Bitch ain't got no class.
You can say that again.
We can say that about a few people in your family.
[Bianca chuckling] Right, baby? Right?
[Bianca] Honey, you are so doing the right thing.
And making me so hot in the process.
-Oh, yeah? -Yeah.
Well, prepare to cool off, cause I'm done with you.
You crazy-ass bitch!
-Ugh. -You know what? Thank you, Bianca.
Thank you so much
for letting me finally see you for the arrogant, sex-crazed,
pretentious, fake-ass celebrity wannabe that you are.
Thank you, Bianca. Thank you.
[scoffs] Oh, well, you're so welcome, Roscoe!
I knew it. You can't handle me.
You're not man enough. You don't have the balls!
King Kong don't have the balls! Bounce!
You just signed your career death certificate.
Our alliance is officially over!
And so are you. Come on, Fiona.
Come on, Fifi. Come to Mommy.
It looks like your alliance is over, and you've been voted off the island.
Bianca, the tribe has spoken. Bounce!
-Dad, you're the man! -I told you who the boss was.
Let's go.
Wait, my bags!
-[RJ] I love you, son. -[Jamaal] I love you too, Dad.
[RJ] Let's go home.
Mama said,
"Girl, it ain't right
to throw hot grits on a man when you have a disagreement."
Sound advice, real good advice, but did I listen?
No. Old Betty had to do it her way.
And that was my second husband. God knows I didn't mean to burn him.
But my third husband, Buck, baby... Buck was good to me!
And any time you get somebody
that's good to you like that, you love 'em.
Big black Buck had the keloid hanging from the ear.
-Looked like he had a leather hearing aid. -Stop!
Daddy, I know you didn't like Buck a lot,
but Buck was a good man when he got out of jail.
I'm gonna tell you something. He did everything he said he was gonna do.
I'm gonna tell you something. He did everything he said he was gonna do. And do you know, Buck was the only man, the only man that could pick me up?
And do you know, Buck was the only man, the only man that could pick me up?
Baby, y'all don't know what it's like for a man to scoop you up like that.
-[Otis] Betty. Betty... -I'm trying to tell 'em!
-Scoop you like... -Betty.
-Get off of me! I'm not finished. -[Otis] Betty.
-[Betty] You a hater! -I ain't no hater.
-We only got five hours to be here. -Shut up!
[applauding] Thank you, Betty! Thank you! Yeah!
And now for our next testimonial. It'll come from Clyde.
All right, how's everybody doing? Ain't God good?
-[all] Yeah. -All the time.
[Clyde] It is a pleasure and a privilege to be here
for Papa J and Mama J's 50th anniversary.
Lord, growing up in this Jenkins household was something else.
And Papa J is a strong man.
Well, this the kind of person, when he say he'll slap the black off you,
I mean the black really will come off.
I woke up light-skinned at least three times in my life.
[Clyde] Yeah, I got it all back.
You all right? You barely ate.
[Clyde] But you know, working in his hardware store...
-I just wish Roscoe were here. -Roscoe made his choice.
You didn't give him much of one.
What was I supposed to do? Be disrespected in my own home?
Be his father.
Giving him your name doesn't make him you, Roscoe.
It doesn't make him Betty or Otis or even Clyde.
He's Roscoe Junior. RJ.
And for a boy who didn't feel the support of his family,
he's doing quite well for himself.
[Clyde] Sleeping in the bottom bunk bed, you know, under RJ, and then,
I was nervous cause he would pee in the bed.
-[crowd laughs] -And that would, you know, that would...
I would have some scary nights sometime.
[Clyde] You know, it's hard sleeping with a raincoat on, you know.
-[crowd laughs] -And, you know, and...
-[crowd laughs] -And, you know, and... And I tried to explain to them that, you know,
that's Roscoe the one that's peeing in the bed, not me.
And, uh, he... [sobs]
[Clyde] You know, just the way they took me in was so gracious.
They didn't have to do that. I thank you. [sniffs
[Clyde] I thank y'all and...
Because I don't know where I would be right now if... -[sobbing loudly] -[mic feedback]
Nigga, what is you crying for?
Big old Sugar Bear-looking-ass boy. Sitting up there crying.
He's still wearing the pajamas with the feet in 'em.
Wow, I've never seen Clyde cry before.
[Clyde] Ain't nobody crying. I'm just cleansing.
No, those some real tears right there. I know.
I've cried more than a newborn baby getting his ass popped.
Hey, guys.
-[RJ] I've been beat up... -Hey, Jamaal!
[RJ]...insulted, laughed at...
-A lot. -[all laughing]
Hey, you're laughing already.
I lost more games and competitions to Clyde than I can remember.
Oh, 3,459 and counting.
Thank you, Clyde.
I thought I was a loser.
So I went away, and transformed myself into what I thought was a winner.
But being around y'all... is a 24-7...
is a 24-7... reality check.
Y'all rough on a brother.
[scoffs] The clothes, the car, the Survivor...
[sighs] Y'all pull no punches.
-You know that's right! -[all laugh]
Betty, you got a hell of a right hand.
That's no joke. And O, you got a hell of a left hand.
-[all laughing] -[RJ] That's right.
But look, I...
I want to thank you, all of you, my family.
Thank you for making me a better man.
For giving me strength to...
To withstand anything this world throws at me.
For unconditional love,
and a place to call "home."
[sobs] Mm-mm. I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna cry.
Happy anniversary, Mommy, Daddy. I love you.
I'm so proud of you.
[sobs] I know. We all need love.
Yeah, come on, Clyde. We gonna let them have this moment.
-I just want a hug, O. -I know. Come over here...
Son...
If I ever drove you away, if I ever made you feel unworthy,
I'm sorry. I love you. Glad to have you back.
I love you. Glad to have you back.
And those words you just said, that's the best gift
I've ever received, RJ Stevens.
Well, it's from the heart, Daddy.
And the name is Jenkins.
Roscoe Steven Jenkins.
Just like my daddy.
-Reggie, come here. -What the hell is wrong with you? What the hell has gotten into you?
What the hell has gotten into you?
Go get her, son.
-[RJ] Lucinda? -Yes?
I waited 20 years to create this opportunity.
Would you dance with me?
I'd love to.
Lucinda, I'm happy for you.
Hey! Betty, come on, let's get out here and cut a rug, girl.
Negro, we're cousins. That's nasty! So desperate. That's a damn shame.
You gonna play me for him? He got on an ankle bracelet!
[mouths] Thank you.
[Papa J] Now, that's a good picture.
-[Mama J] Oh, look at that. -Yeah, this should be good.
-[Otis] That looks good, Reggie. -[Ruthie] That's a blue bonnet, baby. -Pow! -That boy crazy right there, isn't he?
-Pow! -That boy crazy right there, isn't he?
-We do have one hell of a family. -We sure do, Daddy.
-Where are those two anyway? -Oh, Ma, you know where they are.
[both] Uh-uh.
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, your host, Roscoe Jenkins!
All right. Thank you, thank you.
You all looking good. Looking good. What's good, family?
Today's show is about family.
And what better way to kick it off than with the doctor's own?
Say hello to the Jenkins clan.
Hey, y'all! Hey, everybody! Ow! Pump, pump, pump!
Betty. Betty. Yes!
[Betty] Mind your own business, Otis.
-We'll be right back. -We trying to have a good time...
...here on 'Scoe's show. You always gotta say something.
[Betty] Shut up. Shut up.
Let's get started.
You're a doctor, so tell me this.
Why am I having trouble reaching an orgasm?
So you've never been aced?
[Betty] Now, I know how to get myself to the destination,
I just need a captain to navigate the waters.
Now, 'Scoe, you got to help me here.
Is that thing physical or is that thing mental?
Or is it emotional, 'Scoe? Like, where do you go to find...
Can we cut? I'm... I'm uncomfortable.
Wait a minute. I'm trying to figure out how I'm supposed to get mine.
So you think it's okay to spank your kids.
Yeah, I spank my kids. I get in their-- [bleeps]
They-- [bleep] up, I start-- [bleep] them up.
-Tag team. -Oh, cuss words.
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.
[bleep] that! You know me, man.
Hustling is my job. I mean, I ain't never really paid no rent.
You know what I'm saying? I ain't never really paid no bills.
You know what I'm saying? So... But I... For some reason, I've always got cash in my pocket!
I guess it's cause I got a honest face.
I mean, I don't know,
you might have a problem with that since, when we was little,
you might have a problem with that since, when we was little, I would always beat you. You know what I'm saying?
I would always beat you. You know what I'm saying?
You pull out the cards, you one, two, three, you draw four, I'm like...
You pull out the cards, you one, two, three, you draw four, I'm like... Bam! Uno. You know what I'm saying? You make a move, I'm C-4, C-2...
Bam! Uno. You know what I'm saying? You make a move, I'm C-4, C-2...
Bam! I sunk your battleship. You remember that, don't you?
[Betty] And then he be finished. I'm like, "Damn!
Is something wrong with my... My cakes?"
You know what I'm saying? I don't know if something wrong with my tasty cakes, 'Scoe.
You actually tase your kids?
Hell, yeah, I tase my-- [bleep] kids. You shock 'em, they be like...
I say, "You gonna take out that trash now?" He just...
For not taking out the trash?
Forty five thousand volts right through his big-- [bleep]
-"Yes... Dad..." [babbles] -Yeah.
-[cell phone ringing] -Hold it, hold up. Who is this?
Man, I'm on the show. You ain't watching? I'm on the show right now!
I ain't gotta... No, I'm on the show. Look at me. Look.
We could do it right now, bro. You put your hands up. Bam! Bam!
Or rock-paper-scissors.
We could do it right here. I mean, what you scratching for?
You know, you want to scratch? You want to have a scratch battle?
Cause we can scratch out. We can... We could DJ scratch...
I'll make me a bubble bath, light me some little candles,
and then I gets down in that water, 'Scoe, and I be too...
Oh, I'm thinking about it right now. Let me get myself together.
-Cut! Cut! -[Betty] God forgive me.
Take the $150, go buy you a eight ball. Flip the eight ball, you gonna make 300 off that.
Flip the eight ball, you gonna make 300 off that. Take the 300, get you a quarter.
Take the 300, get you a quarter.
[Reggie] Take the quarter ounce, flip that. Stay over at Aunt Lea's...
Like if you... If there wasn't an audience out there,
I would race you up and down the audience steps.
We can go. You know we can go too.
Take the half ounce money, flip the half ounce money.
Now you ready for a ounce. You got a quarter ki now!
Now everybody in the neighborhood got on new sneakers and walkie-talkies.
Everybody is working for you, you doing your thing and everything.
I hope the feds ain't watching this. I'll call you back.
I am. I am afraid, okay? I'm... I'm... I'm afraid of being hurt,
and I don't want to be hurt.
You pursue unattainable men.
-What? -You want men you can't have.
Men I can't have?
Listen here-- [bleep] okay? I can have any man I want, okay?
Don't get me twisted, 'Scoe.
I am pretty in the face and thick around the waist.
You better ask somebody. I got sugar walls!
This right here is sweet tea. Ain't that right, baby?
Yo, ma.
Yeah. I'm saying, Doc, the booty is illmatic!
Well, that wasn't quite what a brother had in mind.
But that's the thing about family.
I saw someone move like they were from another planet.
I couldn't keep my eyes away.
When I was little, my mom took me to watch a jam session in the neighborhood.
It started out small, but word spread.
Soon, some of the best dancers around were showing up
to compete in something they eventually called, "The Streets."
It became the hub, and I got a front-row seat to history.
I wanted to glide and spin and fly like they did.
But it didn't come easy.
My mom would tell me,
"Don't give up, just be you, 'cause life's too short to be anybody else."
And she was right.
When I was 16, my mom got sick.
Within a couple of months, she was gone.
And everything changed,
including The Streets.
Stop it! Stop it!
Somebody help! Get off! Don't...
Suspects jammed it.
[girl] Go! Yeah!
They're going up the stairs. Sir, are you okay?
[man] Hey, buddy.
Run faster!
[Felicia] Yo, the 410 killed it again, man.
That was sick, son.
[Andie] Thank you very much. I'm a genius.
If you do say so yourself.
Girl, get out of here.
Get that mask off.
[Felicia] Yo, we're gonna get some serious YouTube plays, son.
Come on, let's go. We gotta get to the spot before everybody gets there.
Oh, man, we struck gold with this.
Look at that, D.
This is off the chain.
Boards are gonna go crazy over this one.
Yo, let's upload this stat. Not it. Not it.
Aye. Why it gotta be me?
'Cause you're the youngest.
And, obviously, the slowest.
Girl, stop slinging that Spanish at me, Telemundo.
Gotcha!
Oh! Jesus, Tuck!
Oh, man, wish you could see the look on your faces.
Can the jokes, son.
So what did you guys think?
On the real? [clicks tongue]
We killed that!
Oh, yes! Lucky, lucky!
Streets ain't gonna be ready for us this year.
[Missy] Finally.
Let me see that. Let me see that.
Give us my camera back. Give me! Go, go, go!
So what's up? We going out tonight?
I don't know. It's just...
It's been a crazy time, you know, at home with Sarah and all.
Yeah, I heard that before.
Yo, Tuck! Come on, man, we bouncing.
We gotta go. You're always lagging.
[Tuck] All right. I'll see you at rehearsal.
Okay.
[reporter] This video, posted on the Internet just hours ago
was taken earlier today.
It depicts the most recent in a wave of public disturbances
plaguing the streets of Baltimore.
The notoriously elusive 410
has claimed responsibility for this morning's attack
that both defaced public property
and shut down the Charles Center Station over security concerns.
Police have been tracking this troubling trend,
and sources close to the investigation...
Not so fast, Andie. Get in here. Andie! [laughs]
We've got to talk.
I can't believe you.
Dinner was an hour ago.
Sorry, Sarah, the bus was late.
I'm here, aren't I? So just chill out.
Baby, you go on upstairs and go to bed.
[Charlie] Okay.
I know where you've been.
It's all over the news.
So don't stand here and lie to my face.
Do you realize you could have been arrested?
It wasn't a big deal. You have no idea what you're talking about.
You've got to take responsibility for your life, Andie.
You can't follow the 410 forever.
Those people are criminals.
I'm putting my foot down.
This has got to stop. Now.
No!
No, the 410 is the only family I have left.
And who are you to tell me how to live my life?
Your mother was my best friend!
I told her that I would be your guardian.
I promised her that I would take care of you,
so you wouldn't have to leave your life here.
But you won't let me.
Instead, you skip school.
You're out all night.
God only knows what you're doing.
I can't do this.
Your Aunt Alice and I have been talking.
You can't live here anymore.
You're sending me to Texas?
Like I haven't lost enough already?
You can't do this to me!
Your mother never would've let you get away with half the things I have.
No, you have no idea what my mother would have done.
Felicia, where are you?
I don't know what to do. I'm going crazy.
I'm done with her.
Please, I need a place to crash.
I'm not staying there anymore.
Okay, call me. I'm heading to the Dragon.
What's poppin'? I'm the man, DJ Sand.
Tonight, it's all about the Benjamins, baby.
We taking it to The Streets for green.
You got money? No, you don't.
Come on! We gonna get it started.
Brand-new music. Listen to this one.
Yo, Meazy. What's going on?
Yo, D.
What it is? How are ya?
You out to do some damage tonight?
You want to take my bag?
Yes, yes, got it, got it.
It's crazy out there. I know. It is.
About to do your thing? Oh, I will. You know.
Go school them fools. ♪ I'll have you in da ♪
Look who's all grown-up now.
Ty, what are you doing? Oh, my God.
What's up, little one?
Oh. I thought you were in New York with Nora.
Oh, I am. I am. I came back to get the rest of my stuff.
Guess what. What?
Me and Nora are going on tour.
What? Oh, that is unreal.
You better remember me when you get all famous and stuff.
Are you kidding me? Come on!
I remember you when you were running around the neighborhood in diapers.
You were a pain in my ass.
That's really embarrassing.
Seriously, what's going on with you and Sarah?
She called you. No, she didn't call me.
I came by to see you, and she told me you took off.
She's flipping out.
Did she tell you she's sending me away, too?
She don't know what else to do with you.
She's trying to look out for you,
just like your mom and everyone else on the block looked out for me.
So, you're siding with her?
No, I'm not.
You know, I don't even need to explain this.
I'm out. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on. Look, chill out.
If you stop being so stubborn,
maybe you'll realize there are some less dramatic options.
Really, like what?
MSA. [scoffs] Okay.
Maryland School of the Arts.
Yeah, I know what it is.
Are you crazy? Do I look like some princess prima ballerina?
Andie, what other options do you have?
Hmm?
Let me break it down for you.
Sarah will give you one more shot.
But MSA's no joke.
Okay? You gotta go to class.
You can't skip school, you got to study.
No chance, no way.
Okay, fine, I'll battle you for it. Right now.
Look, you win, I never saw you here tonight.
I win, you get your ass back home and you're at MSA first thing in the morning.
Okay, look. If you're scared, just say you're scared.
I wouldn't want to battle me if I was a girl.
No smile?
What, you scared?
You down?
[DJ Sand] Hold it, hold it. Hold up, hold it.
We got royalty in the house. Tyler Gage is in the building.
[crowd cheering] Oh, man.
You know we gotta do something special, right?
Clear the dance floor. Clear it.
Back up! Back up! Back up!
Ladies and gentlemen, here we go.
Brand-new music, y'all.
Oh, man, are those trampolines?
Use 'em or lose 'em.
Here we go.
Cool, y'all.
Hey, you want to get this?
And break my neck?
Nah, I got it.
[DJ Sand] Is she talking crazy?
You still dance like a little girl?
- ♪ Turned around the vibe... ♪ -No, no.
♪ You got to go... ♪ [DJ Sand] Let her know what's good, Tyler.
Watch out, ladies!
[Tyler] Come on, I want to show you.
He's killing it!
Andie's got feels, Tyler.
Come on! Whoo!
She just punched it on you. What you gonna do?
Oh, did she stick you?
She stuck it on you.
That's just rocking!
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Nah! Come on!
He's not...
Oh, no!
He's coming out his clothes!
It's over. It's over.
That's what I'm talking about.
Come on, y'all.
It's all good, Andie. Next time, baby.
It's all right. You're good, ma.
Oh. You okay?
Hey. Don't sweat it.
Everybody's just hatin' on you, 'cause you're dope.
Is you running off again?
No. No?
You know I'm just trying to look out for you, right?
Yeah, whatever.
[mockingly] Yeah, whatever.
Don't give me "whatever."
Let's get you out of here. I've got to get you home,
plus we've still got to sell Sarah on the idea.
I thought she agreed.
[chuckles] Just let me do the talking. Come on.
[Sarah] No. I'm sending her to Texas, and that's final.
She's already on probation at school.
[Tyler] This is the one shot she needs
to take all that anger she's got
and be able to put it into a structure.
She's not going to school now.
What makes you think that she's gonna go to this school?
Piece of cake.
No way. [chuckles]
That's the thanks I get for saving your little ass?
Wait, she's down?
Believe it or not, she thinks I set a good example for you, so...
What? I don't know.
My work here is done.
I'm going home.
Now, all you have to do is get in.
Hold up. I thought you said you took care of everything.
I didn't say I'd get you in. I said I'd get you an audition.
So, go show 'em what you got, all right?
Go hard, all right? Make me proud.
Promise? Promise.
Okay.
Stay out of trouble, all right?
Holy hell. You know what? I cannot believe you're about to do this.
Well, it is this or Texas, so... take your pick.
Don't blow it.
No pressure or anything, girl.
Wait a minute.
[boy] Check that out.
It can't be that bad, going here.
[boy] She's hot.
Missy, shut up.
What? Just stop talking.
I guess.
Look, go in there and kill it.
We'll see you at rehearsal afterwards. All right?
Come on, Missy. [Missy] Good luck, D. Later.
He was cute though, girl.
You're just mad, 'cause he wasn't looking at you.
[Felicia] Girl, he wasn't looking at you or your chapped lips...
Boring. It's a bunch of clones.
Just because they do turns with their feet and not on their heads?
Very funny. Wake me up when they're all done.
I think we'd all agree that talent comes from mastering technique.
I was brought here because I can turn amateurs into professionals.
Nailed it.
Music, please.
Thank you.
[woman] Do you have your paperwork?
Yep.
Hi. Hi.
[man] Thank you, Miss, uh... West.
[Blake] Well, she was different.
Are you kidding me? That was the best dance we've seen today.
The girl's amazing.
She's just a street dancer.
Blake, I thought you could
turn anyone into a professional.
So what happened?
You guys, I choked.
What do you mean?
[cell phone ringing] I tried to get it back, but I just freaked out.
Sarah gonna have her ass down in Texas before we know it.
Hello? Yo, who you talking to?
[Felicia] Oh, here he comes.
I'm sorry. I gotta take this real quick.
Man, what y'all doing?
Come on.
[Missy] How'd she mess up?
Yo, Rap.
Looks like I'm staying.
Oh! Word? Thank goodness, girl.
Yo, cut the music.
Yo, we need a family meeting.
Yo, we got this gig at the Dragon coming up,
and we're not even close to being ready for it.
The 410 is a unit.
We're only as strong as our weakest link.
And with the way our new members are slacking,
we're gonna have to step it up.
Which means rehearsal every day, 4:00 p.m.
No excuses, no being late, and no cell phones.
Are we clear?
[Missy] Crystal. [Felicia] We're clear.
You're in my seat.
[chuckles] I'm kidding.
I mean, this is my seat, but I'll give you a pass for today.
Nice. Nice. Nice shirt, Napoleon Dynamite. Nice.
You look fantastic today, by the way.
Nice hair.
What's up?
I'm Robert Alexander III.
But you can call me Moose.
What's up? I'm Andie.
Oh, no, no. It's like this. Do it again.
We got to blow it up.
Blow it up. Ready? Blow it up.
Pull it back like that.
It's mine, so...
You're not eating? You call this food?
Tofu dogs are both nutritious and delicious.
This is good.
♪ Tastes like candy canes at Christmas ♪
What?
You've got crap on your face.
Oh. I knew we could help each other out.
Oh, what makes you think that I need help?
[mocking] What makes you think I need...
Trust me. I have what you need.
I have the inside on everything.
Who's dating, who's hating.
And who's hooking up.
What's up, Dan? What's up, Gator?
Who's that? See you guys later.
That's the music room.
This is the art room where some of the greatest Baltimore artists...
[girl] I'm dead serious.
Oh! You okay?
Thank you.
We gotta stop meeting like this, you know.
It's Andie, right?
I'm Chase. Welcome to MSA.
I'm glad you made it in.
Well, here I am.
You're an amazing little dancer. You know that?
What?
I said, you're an amazing little dancer.
Little? Really?
Well, you know, I wouldn't call my dancing "little."
Okay, I definitely was not trying to say... [Moose] Andie!
Where have you been? I've been looking for you.
Chase. Hey.
[Moose] How you doing?
Great. So, you guys are friends?
Oh, yeah, we go way back.
Good.
We're actually late for a little something, so...
We are?
Yeah. What?
Remember? That thing you told me?
I didn't tell you anything.
Yes, you did. We're gonna go.
Remember that thing?
What? That thing you wanted to do?
What are you talking about?
I can't believe you know Chase Collins.
That's extremely vital information to withhold.
I don't know him.
He's Mr. Popular.
Like a legacy.
His parents, like, founded this school.
And his brother is legendary.
Dr. Collins is his brother?
Yeah.
He used to go here, then moved to London to dance with the Royal Ballet.
[Andie] Oh, my God. That's him?
Yeah. It's hard to believe, right, with all those feathers.
So why'd he come back?
Good question.
Sources say he has some sweet deal to make MSA the next Juilliard.
Which he's been trying to do.
Maybe he's just burned out.
But one thing's for sure.
There's a lot of changes going down that nobody likes.
Here.
Anyway, the Collins are like flippin' MSA royalty.
Chase, he's a ladies' man.
So he's a player?
Like an all-star.
He's only recently taken the jersey out of retirement.
So be warned.
Oh, and that's Cyborg Sophie.
She's an MSA machine and Collins' crowning achievement.
She's a triple threat.
She acts, sings and dances.
She won every competition out there.
But she just lost the biggest battle of them all,
the one for Chase's heart.
It's like I've landed in an episode of The Hills.
He broke up with her a few weeks ago,
but they'll end up back together and live happily ever after.
Just in time for the season finale, huh?
See? I knew you'd come around.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Director Collins.
I hope you've all stretched this morning,
'cause we have a lot of work to do today.
I'm sure that everyone has heard of our plans
to move MSA into a new state-of-the-art facility.
Well, to encourage the donors, we're throwing a fundraiser,
where you will perform to demonstrate
what a good investment you are.
It should be a wonderful event.
And, yes, you are all required to participate
in one way or another.
So, let's begin with some improv, shall we?
Jimmy, you're up.
You're late.
Not being on time won't fly in the real world.
Come on. Already with that stuff, Blake?
That's Director Collins.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Chase, show us what you got.
Good, not great. Could do better.
Okay. Andie, you're up.
Are you serious?
Listen and interpret. ♪ Ooh, I like you ♪
Andie. Andie!
You're all over the place.
Again, from the top, listen and interpret.
Okay... Stop. Stop!
Can I have a word with you in private?
And bring your bags.
Do you understand you've been given an opportunity
that others couldn't even dream of?
I put my name on the line for you,
and now I'm beginning to wonder if I made a mistake.
You clearly have some catching up to do.
Starting tomorrow, I'm assigning you to attend
after-school sessions with me.
Well, I can't. I gotta be somewhere.
Consider this an opportunity.
What?
[girls chanting] made a mistake and kissed a snake.
How many doctors did it take?
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine...
Just breathe. First day's always the worst.
I was just... That's okay.
I come out front and meditate sometimes, too.
What? It's not meditating.
It's just... You had some pretty serious balls today in class.
I was impressed.
Oh, gee, thanks.
You're welcome.
So what's your deal?
Boy bands making a comeback?
Yeah. They have a course on it here.
I'm getting straight A's.
That wouldn't surprise me.
Look, um, it's been interesting bonding with you, but I'm late.
Late for what?
Just this rehearsal thing.
Rehearsal for what?
Just rehearsal with some friends.
Like a crew?
What would you know about that?
Knew it. Saw you at the Dragon. You're with 410.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've wanted to compete there, I've just never had an in.
Can you hook me up?
Hey, Chase,
we're working on the routine for the fundraiser.
Are you coming? [Chase] Yeah, I'll be right there.
Sophie, I'll meet you in the rehearsal.
Okay.
Look...
The Streets is about where you're from.
It's not some school talent show.
There's no spring floors. There's no spotlights.
You use what you got and...
What makes you think you got it, huh?
Weren't you late for something, Andie?
Bye, Andie West.
[Hip Hop music playing] Five, six, seven, eight.
Again. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four.
Whoa, wait, oh, wait.
You used to do that part different.
Can you do that from "three, four" again, please?
Let me go figure this out. Y'all just chill here for a second.
Where have you been at, man? I've been texting you all day.
I know, I'm sorry.
This school thing is crazy.
Will you cover for me with Tuck?
Don't I always cover for you? Yes.
Yo, D, let me holler at you.
Yo, where you been?
I just had to take care of some stuff.
Oh, yeah, with who?
Charlie.
Sarah asked me to take care of him while she was at work.
You still coming over tonight or what?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna take care of stuff, and I'll be there.
All right.
Yo! Start it from the beginning.
Okay, now, point your toe.
You see, you're sickling.
There should be no curve disrupting the line from the knee
all the way down to the tip of your toe.
Ow! Ow! There you go. That's it.
There. That's it. Ow.
Pointing hurts. Yeah, it's supposed to.
Pull in your stomach.
Flat, flat, flat.
Now, tuck your butt.
Keep this leg turned out.
Turned out. Turned out!
Oh, my God.
Balance, balance.
Chasse, pas de bourree.
Turn, turn, down, finish.
Turn, turn, spot, spot!
Ready, and feet in front, feet back,
feet front, feet back. Come on.
And back, and back, and back, and back, and back,
and back, and back, and back, and back,
and back...
Good! That's it.
Andie? There's dinner down here.
Yo, where D at?
Uh, she just left me a message.
Sarah got her on lockdown again.
Guess she's missing out... again.
Guess so.
[Moose] And then, I was like, "Damn, your breath stinks, girl!"
[Andie] Why would you say that to her?
'Cause I thought it would be cool.
Well, it wasn't.
It's my mom.
Oh, my gosh.
What? That is not your ringtone.
Why? It's the coolest thing ever.
Okay, fine. Listen.
Here we go. Watch me, watch me, watch.
[Andie] I don't even know him.
You were so sick.
I had no idea you could dance.
It's whatever. What are you talking about?
Why don't you dance here?
I can freestyle all right. Right?
But I didn't get in here for dance.
I mean, I didn't think I could do choreography.
Now I'm all about lighting design.
The end's not working.
Mixing those moves just feels wrong.
Come on, man.
Let me show you something.
If you put this here into a canon,
and then swing through to fifth,
then bring it down.
Step, step, stag.
Soutenu, double tour to the knee.
Nice, Jimmy.
Looks like someone's in a good mood.
Must be hard living in the shadow of a legend, huh?
Wow, that coming from the MSA charity case?
I was just kidding.
You're right, he's an ass. I'm out of here.
Look, I never called you an ass.
She just said that for dramatic effect.
If you're trying to win her over,
you probably shouldn't treat her like that.
I'm not trying to win her over.
Then don't lead her on.
Andie.
Hey. What's going on?
I wanted to apologize for earlier today. It wasn't anything personal.
I had a really rough day and I was joking.
Oh, please.
It's not like I sit up at night and think about
what you do or don't say to me, but thanks.
I feel better now.
Let me give you a ride. Make it up to you.
I can just... I have to take the bus.
No, come on. My car's gotta smell better than the bus.
[Missy] There she is. [Felicia] She really come when we're done. Huh?
She missed the whole rehearsal. Whatever.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Miss Thing Girl. Where you been at?
What's the deal?
Thank you for finally gracing us with your presence.
Rehearsal's done.
Hey, hey, come on.
I got here as soon as I could.
You know what's been going on lately.
No, I don't.
I'll tell you what's been going on.
Everybody's been asking, "Have you talked to D?
"Where's D at? Have you heard from her?"
And I'm here looking like an ass making stuff up for you,
so you can go dance around your fancy new school.
What is your problem?
Yo. What's going on here? Nothing.
Ask her. What was that?
I said, "Ask her."
D, you got to tell me something?
Yeah, the reason I've been late
and haven't been around much is because...
I've been going to school at MSA.
So you've been lying to me and the crew for what?
Those ballet boys?
You guys don't understand. I don't have a choice.
No, that's messed up, D.
We're family.
I thought you said you understood that.
The 410 don't come second to nobody.
You out.
No, please, Tuck, come on.
It's just been a crazy time.
It's always been a crazy time with you.
Yo, let's go.
Oh! Hey, watch yourself, huh?
God...
Morning, sunshine.
The good times just keep on coming, don't they?
Ouch.
What got into you today?
What? As opposed to my winning charm every other day?
Fair enough. Two points to the new girl.
You want to talk about it?
I got kicked out of my crew.
What for?
For being here.
You know, I can't believe I messed this up.
I think they messed up.
They lost an amazing dancer.
You should just start your own crew.
No, you can't just start your own crew.
Why not? Because you can't.
Besides, who would be in it? Me and...
Me.
Us. Okay. We'll just start our own crew.
What else you gonna do?
No. Nobody here is gonna step out of their perfect little world.
Maybe not the Sophie Donovans,
but there's a lot going on here under the radar.
Really?
[Chase] There's this guy we call Hair.
He's this half hippy, half rhythmic rebel,
and he makes the sickest beats you've ever heard.
Teachers don't know what to do with him.
You can't put him in a class, because he just gets bored,
and starts making up his own steps.
There's Kido. She's this foreign exchange student
obsessed with old-school American hip hop.
And, trust me, she doesn't need to know English to speak our language.
Fly's the quiet one, but not when the music's on.
She's too tall to partner,
but when you're that good, who needs a partner?
Which brings us to Monster, our resident stunt double.
He flips, he slides, he falls.
Whatever you need to make an action sequence work onstage.
But he never gets the spotlight.
Most know my boy, Cable, as the video yearbook editor.
But little do they know,
he's one of the best freestyle dancers I've ever seen in my life.
And, finally, Smiles.
Nicest guy you'll ever meet.
Dopest dancer on the dance floor.
Unfortunately, MSA only sees what it wants to see.
[Andie] Don't forget Moose.
[Chase] Moose?
Yeah, trust me on this one.
Come on!
[Andie] But what makes you think they'll do it?
[Chase] They all have nothing to lose.
No!
You guys, listen up. Check it out.
Now, I know each and every one of you here
knows what it's like to be forced to conform and become an MSA robot, right?
Yeah, they wanted me to cut my hair.
Yeah, and fix my teeth.
I like your teeth.
Thank you. I like your accent.
What kind of accent?
The accent you have. You have an accent.
I have no accent. It's really strong.
[Chase] That's exactly my point.
And I also know that each one of you guys
has a really amazing talent that this school doesn't know what to do with.
So, I think it's time we do something with that talent.
Like what? Like form a crew and compete at The Streets.
[all] No, no!
I heard it's dangerous.
Forget about what you heard.
The Streets is about the best dance crew showing off what they got.
We don't stand a chance.
What are you talking about?
Freddie, I've seen you do your stunts in the school play.
There's a reason they call you Monster.
Yeah, like this?
[laughs] That was hot.
And, Kido, you went crazy at the showcase after-party last year.
Oh, that was fun.
Hey, hey. Get it, get it. Hey, hey, hey.
Get it. Get it, Kido.
She won't... She won't stop.
She won't stop, she won't. You need to stop.
So when is it?
That's the thing.
Nobody knows when or where until a text message of the night of.
So we have got to be ready.
Sounds good, but, Director Collins would never let us rehearse here.
[Smiles] True. No way.
Who said Director Collins has to know?
[Smiles] Wow. [Kido] He's got the keys.
Borrowed and copied.
MSA after hours. I like it.
Yeah!
What do you say we go and check out our competition?
[DJ Sand] Oh man! Put your hands together.
Ow! Put your hands up!
Hey, yo, Leesh.
Leesh, look, look, look, look. Andie's here.
Where? Right there.
She shouldn't be.
Yo, what you doing here, man?
Oh, please don't tell me that's your new crew.
No. Yeah, we're her crew.
We're getting ready to battle at The Streets.
What street, Sesame Street?
[laughter] What do you know about The Streets?
Why don't you guys back off, all right?
We're just here to check a few things out.
So, this is how you've been wasting your time, with these losers? Huh?
Listen, buddy. Why don't you just go do your thing?
We're just gonna be over here doing ours.
Oh, you got a thing that you do?
Why don't you show us, then, homeboy?
All right, let's go.
Yeah, let's go.
Hey, yo, DJ Sand!
Drop that beat, homey.
Looks like we've got new fish in town.
Let's clear the dance floor.
We gonna see what they talking about.
Now, you come into my house, you recognize what's going on.
Don't step in that circle if you ain't got it.
What's up, bro? I don't know you!
I don't know when to start.
Five. Start on five when I start.
[DJ Sand] The music's playing already.
Dance to the music.
That's not how we do it here.
This ain't High School Musical.
That's how you dance? Your mama taught you that?
We don't dance like that.
That's what you learned at your special school?
Boo!
Quit it!
[DJ Sand] That's atrocious.
[turns off music] That's it. No more. No more.
What in the hell was that?
That's how you dance?
I'll tell you what. We gonna show you how we really get down.
Y'all pick up a key chain on the way out.
Tell your mama not to be late picking you up from work.
[man] You guys are garbage!
All right, man. Well, let's get it.
410, can we get it started?
Let's get it started. Here we go.
[DJ Sand] That's what I'm talkin' about!
Aren't they entertaining?
[DJ Sand] That's how we do it.
You can't learn that in school!
Let's just regroup tomorrow.
Come on.
[Chase] Guys, come on. This is one performance.
You can't let it get you that down.
[Andie] We didn't work this hard to just give up, you know.
[Smiles] We shouldn't have went out there in the first place.
We looked like idiots.
[Cable] Seriously, Chase. You know, the choreography wasn't even right for this.
Hey. Oh, it's cool. I know her.
What are you doing here?
Things got way out of hand last night.
Yeah. Thanks for your support.
Look, I'm sorry.
What they did to you was wrong.
But you should know that I quit.
What? Yeah.
They're all on such a power trip. I refuse.
I thought we were supposed to be about family, you know.
And it just wasn't the same without you.
But, look, I miss you.
I haven't seen you in that long.
My family's having a barbecue this Saturday.
Why don't you come through?
So that's why you came by?
Yeah.
You know, Felicia is going to trip if she knows you're here.
Felicia should be the last of your worries right now.
I swear, we're really not that bad.
Really. Come on.
Hey, you guys,
this is my girl, Missy.
She's here to, uh...
help us out.
[Smiles] Help us out?
We bombed last night.
[Cable] Yeah. Our respect went out the window.
[Smiles] Sure did.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
What are y'all talking about, respect went out the window?
Like, respect is gone? You can always get it back.
So what are you all thinking for The Prank though?
[stutters] What's The Prank?
Yo, D, you ain't tell them about The Prank?
The Prank is what the crews do to show the world they're competing for The Streets.
It's a public declaration saying that you're bringing it.
The crazier it is, the better.
For proof, you gotta record it and post it online.
And then it spreads like wildfire.
Then, if you guys hit it like I know you can,
y'all get your respect back.
I got an idea.
[man] Watch this, watch this!
Been runnin' that ball on him all day, son.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Yo! Why's my crib smell like Funyuns,
broccoli and ball sweat?
It's your boy, Crumbs.
He's been letting it loose all day.
It's the coffee, bro.
Oh, hell no. Yo, Tuck, come see this.
You gotta come see this, bro.

Why are you here on a Saturday?
We were gonna do the same thing, but it's locked. So...
Oh. We gotta roll, so we'll see y'all.
Where are we going?

Yeah, yeah, barbecue.
Why you standing there? Let's be out.

Where are we going? You'll see.
[Andie] I can't believe I'm doing this.
What's wrong with what I had before?
Latin men like their girls to look like women, not boys.
A fact you'll appreciate when you meet my cousin.
You are not setting me up.
Alejandro's nice.
Plus, he just got here.
Oh. You're pimping me out
so that your cousin can get a green card?
He's from Florida.
Trust me, if he was not my cousin,
you would not be standing there.
You're sick. Mm-hmm!
And I'm hungry, so are we done here?
I guess.
Ooh, Miss Thing, you got titties?
Why you trying to look better than me at my party?
Hey, cuz. Hey, mama.
How you doing? Good, and you?
This is my friend, Andie.
Andie, my cousin, Alejandro. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

No, it's not that bad.
Yes, it is.
No, we're good.
All right. Tree climber.
All right, this is gonna sound cheesy, but...
for what it's worth, I'm really glad you're at MSA.
I think you were doing just fine before I got there.
That's just the thing.
I mean, I've been trained to dance since I first learned to walk.
But it's always been about
doing it their way, and it's just not me.
But, ever since you came, I feel more like myself.
Oh, geez.
Well, I know what you mean.
My mom always used to tell me, "Just be yourself."
When I was little, that sounded strange,
'cause I was like, "How could I be anyone else?"
I bet you miss her.
Yeah.
When she got cancer, it was like the floor fell from underneath me.
I've just been running ever since.
But now I can't find my way back.
Well, maybe it's not about going back.
Maybe it's about being right where you are.
I heard you was dancing it up in there.
What, you not joking now?
Come on, guys, I'm just trying to get home.
You thought it was real funny, what you did the other day.
Tuck, it's a joke.
Look here.
Just 'cause you hang out with D, don't mean you got what it takes.
She don't know where she came from.
You don't know anything about her.
So now you defending her?
Yes, I am. I'll see you at The Streets.
At The Streets?
You in the streets now.
Unless you want some more of us,
I suggest you stay away from The Streets.
And stay farther away from Andie.
Drop this fool.
Come on, get up, fool.
Get up!
You're not so funny now, are you, clown?
Hey, yo, Tuck.
Hey. Chase, what's going on? Hey.
Hi. Hi.
How you doing?
Is everything okay?
Yes, everything's okay. Why wouldn't everything be okay?
Oh, my God. What happened to you?
Nothing. Nothing. Don't worry. Listen, I've got to get to class.
No. That is not nothing. Who did this to you?
Just forget about it.
Let it go.
Does anybody know who is responsible for this?
This school will not be associated with these competitions.
Any future involvement by our students in The Streets will lead to expulsion.
And anyone with any information
is expected to come forward.
Get this place cleaned up.
Man, I can't believe they trashed the studio.
Now we have Director Collins on our back.
That glass was all over the floor.
Somebody broke the stereo, too.
[Kido] It's crazy. I don't understand.
[Cable] These guys are no joke.
[Smiles] Collins was seriously pissed.
[Moose] Man, the graffiti was everywhere.
What are we gonna do?
We could get expelled.
Yo. My parents would kill me if I got expelled.
I'd have to go to a regular school with regular kids.
Hey, guys.
This has gotten way out of hand.
I'm really sorry that I got you all into this.
Andie, don't say that.
I put everything you guys worked for at risk.
And it's not fair.
We're all in on this together.
No, it's over.
The crew's done. I don't know what we were thinking.
Andie West, Director Collins would like to see you.
By being involved in this competition,
you've brought delinquent behavior into my school
and put my students at risk.
And now the studio has been vandalized.
It wasn't exactly like that.
I thought I could train you,
turn you into the dancer that you could be.
But I was wrong.
There's nothing we can do for someone
who doesn't appreciate what's in front of them.
I understand.
You know, I really did try.
I'm not done.
Was there anyone else involved from this school?
No.
No one else. Just me.
Then I have no choice but to expel you.
But I didn't... I'm sorry.
That's it. I'm finished. Please leave.
[Chase] Andie.
There you are. I've been looking all over for you.
What are we gonna do?
It's done. Everything's done.
I think it's pretty clear
that none of this was meant to be.
Whoa, Andie. Don't do this.
Please just... Just let it go.
[Sarah] You got that? Mm-hmm.
You're my big strong boy, huh?
I am your big strong boy.
Your school called.
I know I said things would be different...
I know what happened.
No more excuses, Andie.
I'm sick and tired of this.
You're going to your aunt's in Texas, and that's final.
It was my idea.
Your idea for what?
To compete in The Streets.
The whole thing was my idea,
so if you're gonna throw someone out, it should have been me.
Don't be ridiculous. I'm not throwing you out.
How would that make me look?
Blake, I'm not gonna let her take the fall for this.
I should never have let her in.
It didn't benefit us in any way.
Not everything we do has to benefit us.
Some people, Andie in particular,
do what they love just because.
Isn't that why we started dancing in the first place?
Look, I have a lot to do for the fundraiser.
And so do you.
My decision about Andie is final.
We're done here.
Oh, Peggy Beckham.
Here you are.
See, this is our new building.
Made of glass with state-of-the-art studios.
Hey. Is Andie here?
Andie? It's for you.
What are you guys doing here?
Andie, we're going.
Eighth and Main, The Streets.
We need you.
No, but what about the fundraiser?
You could all be expelled.
Forget the fundraiser.
We don't want the school to move.
It's time we took a stand, Andie. Just like you did.
And if MSA doesn't want you...
Then we don't want you.
What are you talking about?
We do want Andie. We want Andie in, yes, right?
Yes. Look,
you brought us together
and took the fall for us when we should have all done more.
[Chase] Andie, that's why we're here.
We've all made a lot of mistakes, but now's our time.
We can go all the way.
If we don't try, then it was all for nothing.
Come on, are you in?
I can't.
[all] Why?
[Andie] I promised Sarah I'd finish packing tonight.
Andie?
Can we talk a minute?
Yeah. I'll be right back.
I made a promise to your mom to take care of you, and I want to keep it.
I know.
I understand that and I am done fighting.
You know, you remind me so much of your mother.
You have her passion.
She was a really good friend to me, Andie.
Just like you are to them.
I just feel like I finally found this place where I belong.
I found people who believe in me.
I believe in you, too.
I've seen a change in you, Andie.
You should go tonight.
Really?
She'd want you to.
Let's do this.
[DJ Sand] Baltimore, y'all ready?
We gonna get down to it, see who has the hottest skills.
The dopest squad.
You ready to get it started?
It's The Streets, baby.
[Missy] Take a left. [Smiles] And slow down.
[Kido] Faster, faster! I love America! Whoo!
It's your man, DJ Sand, and it's the battle of the year.
We're getting ready to get really banoodles out here.
Can y'all handle that?
Baltimore, what's popping!
Yo, man, you see this?
Are you coming?
What part of "You don't belong here" do you not understand?
Why don't you chill?
We're just trying to perform here like everyone else.
[Tuck] Yo, homey, this is how it is.
You're not invited.
This is a closed event. For locals only.
Besides, that jazz funk that y'all pulled at the Dragon ain't gonna cut it here.
Neither will those same moves you've been doing for the past five years.
And by the way, I really liked your place,
but I think that fish made it smell better.
What, you say something?
I will knock you out, boy!
Disrespect me in my place?
You boys fighting in my house now?
You think you're funny, 'cause you coming from somewhere?
You want to tell me what the hell is going on?
They're at The Streets.
The Streets?
I have to stop this.
Wait.
You always tell us that dance
is about having something to say, right?
Yes, but, I never meant for anyone...
Well, I think that
a lot of people are finally speaking up.
I can't just allow my students to participate in something illegal.
Well, there's a reason they're there and not here.
You should take a look for yourself. I think you'd be surprised.
And you are?
I'm Robert Alexander III.
But you can call me Moose.
I dance with their crew.
You dance?
Damn right, I dance.
I can take you to where they are.
Okay, Goose, let's go.
No, it's Moose. Whatever.
Wait. I'm coming with you guys.
[DJ Sand] This is the moment you've all been waiting for.
At this time, let me introduce the five time reigning champ.
Give it up, make some noise, for the 410!
[DJ Sand] Check it out, baby! That's what I'm talkin' about!
Give it up to the 410!
All right, you've seen 'em all.
Tell me who the hottest crew in Baltimore is.
Come on. That's what you think?
I don't know, the 410 killed it.
All right, y'all, let's hit it.
[DJ Sand] That's how you feel, baby?
Whoa, B, what's going on?
Yo, this is a neighborhood battle.
You're out of luck.
Now, go home. Leave.
That's mad wack, B.
[DJ Sand] We're gonna get to it, figure it out after this.
Andie!
Hey, yo, it's not done yet. We've got one more for you.
My crew's back there.
We want a shot.
Hey! Yo!
Look. We're all here because...
All right, all right.
Yo. Some of you guys think...
Some of you guys think that we don't belong here.
What is she doing? [Andie] It doesn't matter where we're from.
[woman] You are not the valedictorian.
All right, all right. All right.
Let me just say something.
The Streets are supposed to be about different people coming together.
We call this a battle, but what are we fighting for?
We're all here because we have this thing we do.
We dance. Right?
Being a part of The Street used to mean much more than just turf or power.
It was about bringing something new to the floor.
And it shouldn't matter what we wear,
what school or what neighborhood we're from.
Because the best part about The Streets
is that it's not about what you've got.
It's what you make of what you've got.
So, if the 410 is too scared
to defend their title against us,
then, hell, we'll be outside doing our thing, where The Streets started.
We'll accept that.
I'm sure we've got something that will work.
Lada! Ooh!
Hit it, hit it, hit it.
Go, go, go!
[Chase] Yeah, we did it, baby.
All right! Whoo!
Well...
That was different.
[laughs] Yeah, sorry about the whole toe-pointing thing.
Yeah. I guess that didn't stick too well.
No, but, I'll keep working on that.
Yeah, you will, in my class.
At school on Monday.
Oh, my God! Whoa.
Hey, Moose!
Yeah, you.
I think you might be in the wrong department.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a little explaining to do at the fundraiser.
Oh, yeah.
So, see, I told you we could help each other out.
Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Whatever.
Blow it up.
Moose, hey.
Hey, Soph. How you doing?
I'm good. How are you?
Did you see us out there? That was great.
Sliding and flipping. My hat trick, it was amazing.
I mean, I was just doing it. I know.
Like, it was amazing.
That's what I thought.
Andie! Andie!
Hey! Happy birthday.
Open your present. Blow out your candles.
You did so good, mama. I'm so proud of you.
Andie, I love you.
I love you.
I gotta go.
I gotta pump. I gotta pump.
I thought you said we couldn't start our own crew.
Coffee in Paris, surfed the Maldives, took a little nap on Mount Kilimanjaro.
And I got digits from this Polish chick in Rio.
Then I jumped back for the final quarter of the NBA Finals--courtside, of course.
Then I jumped back for the final quarter of the NBA Finals--courtside, of course. And all that was before lunch.
All I'm saying is, I'm standing on top of the world.
The lighter terrain...
It wasn't always like this.
Once I was a normal person, a chump just like you.
-Hey, Millie. -Hey, David.
A lot of cities there.
If you have a dream, might as well be big.
See you later.
Hey, Millie!
Give me a sec.
He's such a loser.
I wanted to give you this. I picked it up at a yard sale.
I thought you'd like it.
It's a little dinged up and missing a few steps, but....
I love it.
-You do? -I do.
Holy crap, Ricebowl!
What's this?
Christmas come early?
Mark, give it back to her.
Look what David got Millie! The Eiffel Tower!
If you shake it hard enough, the Eiffel Tower moves.
If you shake it hard enough, the Eiffel Tower moves. Who wants to shake this?
Who wants to shake this?
That's enough! Stop it. Just give it back.
Okay. I'm sorry. Here.
Sorry. I don't know my own strength.
-Why are you such a jerk? -I was playing around.
-It wasn't funny. -They thought it was funny.
David?
Don't go out there! It's not safe!
Just forget about it!
Don't be stupid, Ricebowl!
David, come back! Just let it go. It's okay.
Stop. It's not worth it. Just come back, please.
Come on, David.
-Be careful. Come on. -All good, see?
Good. Now come back.
-David! -Millie, don't go out there!
David! Get help, somebody!
Mark! Let go!
David! Help!
Help!
Please! Help! David!
Call 911!
David!
Millie, stop, stop!
And that's how it happened the first time.
One second I'm a goner...
...and next thing I know, I'm at the Ann Arbor Public Library.
Home sweet home.
Mom left when I was five.
And as for Dad, well, let's just say he wasn't much of one.
You're late!
Supper's cold.
Where were you, anyway?
When I ask a question, I expect an answer, okay?
What happened to you?
Just kids at school.
Hey! Get back down here, get a mop and clean this crap up now!
David! Don't make me come up there!
David? Make the right choice!
David! Open the door!
Did I just teleport?
Great.
I can teleport to a library.
What are you talking about? I'm not going.
Fine. We'll escort you.
-Get in the car. -I'm not going anywhere.
And that's when it occurred to me.
This thing that just happened... ...it could set me free.
If she could run away...so could I.
I wanted to tell her everything.
David?
I mean, who would have believed me anyway?
David?
I figured it was time to move on.
I'd like a room.
You won't be any trouble, will you? No weird stuff?
Nope. No weird stuff.
So there I was. I had a million questions.
Like how does this thing work? How do I control it?
-Been there. -Mommy!
-Mommy, you can see the ocean! -Maybe we'll see King Kong.
Really?
You got me?
I got you. I'm not letting you go.
I was fifteen.
Come on. What would you have done?
I figured I'd pay it back some day.
Is there a bathroom for customers?
It's this way.
Make it quick.
No problem. Thanks.
I'm going to need a bigger bag.
Holy shit.
I said no weird stuff!
Two days rent! You owe me rent!
Hello? Hello!
The police and FBI were already here. Who are you with?
NSA.
They couldn't make sense of it.
The vault has a time lock, steel plates. This guy didn't even--
Open a door?
We didn't find out until halfway through the day.
I want the security tapes for the month...
...and the name of everyone with a safety deposit box.
That's confidential. Why do you need those names?
Whoever robbed your vault has been in it before.
Now I want those names and I want those tapes, today.
So the story had a happy ending.
Ricebowl was dead, but I'd never been more alive.
Now I'm living in New York.
But why settle on one place when you can have the whole world?
--as you can see, this flood became more severe about 10 minutes ago.
The question now is, what will happen to these people?
It would take a miracle to get to them.
Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
-How are they doing? -Down by 6 at the half.
You won't need that umbrella.
You never know.
Watch it!
You mind if I join you?
No.
What are you drinking?
Gin and tonic.
Tanqueray and tonic. Two, please.
So, you live in London?
Taxi!
Shit.
This totally sucks.
I thought this was where the storm was supposed to hit.
I heard it hit Fiji.
Fiji?
They got 30-foot swells.
Really?
To your left! Move!
We have him!
Let's go.
-Why? -Because you are an abomination.
Only God should have the power to be all places at all times.
One less of you to worry about.
Cut him down! Let's get out of here.
We have a lead on the banks, sir.
I'll be on the next plane.
How'd they do, Angelo?
Not so good.
-I told you you didn't need an umbrella. -You were right.
Don't run.
Eight years we've been looking for you.
And who are you?
My name's Roland.
-What are you doing here? -We'll get to that.
IOU
What kind of crook leaves a note?
I need to talk to my lawyers.
Why? You're not under arrest.
-You're not the-- -Police?
Anybody can rob a bank. What I'd like to know is...
Anybody can rob a bank. What I'd like to know is... ...how you rob a bank without opening any doors.
Come on. I'm sure you can think of something.
Look, uh... ...if you're not the police...
...and I'm not under arrest...
...I'd like you to leave.
Need some help with that?
Been a while since you used a door, huh?
Oh, I know who you are.
And I know what you are.
This conversation's over.
This conversation's not over until you answer my questions!
Tell me...
...how'd you last this long?
Who's helping you?
Jumpers.
Hard to jump with 1,000 volts of electricity passing through your brain.
Who's protecting you? Tell me, so I can go home.
I hate jumpers.
Did you think you'd do this forever?
Living like this, with no consequences?
There are always consequences.
Where are you going?
I got you now.
You think you can hide behind a wall?
You think you can hide behind a wall? Go anywhere?! Do anything?! Not anymore!
David?
David? Is that you?
David! Don't go! Don't go.
Just hear me out, okay?
David, I don't know... ...if I'm going crazy here or not.
I don't know a lot these days, but if you can hear me...
...just wait. Don't go! I have to talk to you!
David, if you can hear me, son...
...it's okay.
You can come home any time you want.
You're not crazy.
Telecommunications.
This is Roland. He got away.
We have his jump sites.
I want everybody up and running. Everybody.
Who is this?
May I help you?
Yeah, uh....
Hi, Mrs. Harris. It's me, David.
David? David Rice?
-Millie was right. You're not-- -Dead? No, I'm not.
Actually, I was hoping you could tell me where Millie is.
Millie? She has her own place over on Morton, number 260.
She's still here?
Yeah. She works at Hoolihan's Bar, down by the campus.
Millie, I need those pitchers!
Okay, you saw her.
Holy crap! Ricebowl?
Mark! Mark Kobold!
Sorry. I don't know you.
Jesus Christ, am I seeing a ghost? Is this some kind of sixth sense shit?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Everybody, it's Ricebowl!
Come on, grab a beer with a buddy from high school.
-I'm not this-- -David?
I knew it was the Ricecake.
Millie?
Hi. You were going to leave without saying anything?
I didn't see you. No? Haven't you been staring at me for the past 45 minutes?
No? Haven't you been staring at me for the past 45 minutes?
Yeah, David. Why didn't you say something?
-I think you're drunk. -I am not.
I'm cool. I am totally, 110% cool.
Yeah, that was cool. Why don't you go sleep it off, okay?
Why don't you go make me a drink, sweetheart?
With a splash of that. 242
Stop it! 242
Stop!
Ricebowl goes down!
What did you do to me? Freak!
I guess I don't know my own strength.
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
Where's Mark?
He took off.
I don't think he's going to come back anytime soon.
You're bleeding a little.
We should take care of that. Come on.
You saw me as soon as I came in?
Maybe.
I didn't know what to say.
How about, "Hi." "Hello." "Been a long time." "How are you?"
Hi.
Hello. Been a long time. How are you?
I'm good. How are you?
Why don't we skip this boring stuff?
-I didn't think you'd still be here. -Where else would I be?
You had those lists. You were going to travel the world, and....
Things change. We all need to grow up, right?
What do you do?
Banking. I'm in banking.
Banking? How did you get into that?
It's pretty easy, actually. Just sort of landed in it.
Didn't you flunk algebra?
No.
-Fiona, I'm going to take my break now. -Sure.
So... ...you're back. What now? What's your plan?
...you're back. What now? What's your plan?
Maybe do some traveling.
I was thinking of checking out Rome, actually.
You were "thinking of checking out Rome"?
That was my dream. Don't try to rip me off.
-So come with me. -Come with you?
You're asking me to go to Rome?
Only if you want to "skip the boring parts".
I got it.
-I'll take it! -If you like.
Can you believe just 10 hours ago we were in Ann Arbor?
What does the CIA want with this?
I'm afraid that's classified.
Really?
Then I'm afraid I'll have to see a federal warrant.
I don't believe you are who you say you are.
Certainly.
Great. Another cop.
So, Mark... ...what happened at the bank?
I told them already. You're just another suit. You'll never believe me.
You're just another suit. You'll never believe me.
It says here you were "beamed" into the vault.
You want to laugh about it? Go ahead, laugh.
You hear me laughing?
The girl's name is Millie Harris.
She boarded a plane to Rome 16 hours ago and she didn't go alone.
So, what do you think?
I think there's something you're not telling me.
What do you mean?
This room.
First class.
Usually in my life, when things seem too good to be true, they are.
-I told you, I'm in-- -Banking?
I know that you flunked algebra.
If you don't want to tell me everything, that's fine.
But don't lie to me.
I'm not lying to you.
No?
Good.
I can't reach it.
I could eat.
You could have just asked me on a date.
This has always been number one on my list.
-I know. -You must be pretty good at this, huh?
Good at what?
Rookie.
No idea.
No, sorry, sir. Sorry, sorry. No.
No, it's closed.
What do you mean, it's closed? How is it closed?
-We just want to go inside there. -No, it's impossible.
-How is it closed? -It's impossible
David, it's okay. I got to see it from the outside. That's good enough.
She came all this way to go in.
Come on.
Sorry, he's-- I don't know.
Millie! Come on.
How about a private tour?
It's closed. We can't break in.
Who said it's closed? The door was open.
You want to see it or not?
Come on.
We so should not be doing this.
-This place is amazing. -I wanted you to see this.
You have to admit it's worth the risk.
It's so cool!
Down there is where they kept the gladiators, and the lions in cages.
-We should go down there. -We can't. It's off-limits.
-We should go down there. -We can't. It's off-limits. Nothing's off-limits.
What?
Was that door just open, too?
It's open now.
You'll want to see this. Trust me.
Bet that's worth something.
Maybe.
I think he's saying "Do not enter".
Do you speak Italian?
Nope.
-Well, "l'ingresso" means "Come on in". -Oh, I thought it meant "bullshit".
It means you stay here while I go around and open it from the other side.
It's okay. You'll catch on.
Thank you very much. The next showing is at 6:00.
Don't forget to tip your usher.
A little busy here.
I can see.
Never mind.
I wouldn't open that door.
Not if I wanted my girlfriend to keep breathing.
What are you going to do, bring her down for a nice, romantic picnic?
-Is that what you think? -If you even look at her--
What will you do? Jump me away?
Did you think you were the only one?
You really have no idea, do you?
Did you think you could just go on a Roman holiday and they wouldn't notice?
Just jump all over the place. Jump, jump, jump. And nothing will happen?
They've noticed.
Not me. I already knew. I'm not talking about me, but them.
Down there.
Hello, boys.
Just me, then.
Ah...that's new.
Welcome to the war.
Let me know if you get tired!
Close.
David?
What's going on?
Let's meet the girlfriend.
Who are these people?
Paladins. Paladins kill jumpers. I kill Paladins. Class dismissed.
Wait!
I came through your jump scar.
What are you doing here?
If I were you, I'd jump back.
You're not supposed to see this stuff.
So if you'd kindly fuck off... ...as in now, maybe your girlfriend's still alive.
...as in now, maybe your girlfriend's still alive.
-What happened to you? -Nothing.
Let's go. I think we should get out of here.
That didn't sound like nothing.
You were right. I shouldn't have gone down there.
Come on. We can still make the museum.
Will you talk to me?
There must be a cab.
Will you please just talk to me?
-I'll tell you back at the hotel. -I'm not waiting for the hotel.
Millie, it's all fine, okay?
-It's not fine. -I wasn't supposed to go back there.
-I think you guys made a mistake. -Be quiet.
I know I wasn't supposed to be back there.
You're looking for that guy.
Can you let us off with a warning? Okay, okay.
Go back to the hotel.
Yes, I'm with him. I'm with him!
I don't know her. Millie, go to the hotel.
I told you... ...I want to see Millie.
Where is the body?
I didn't do anything. How many times do you want me to say that?
How much longer will he be?
We wait for magistrato.
Yeah, I know. We've been waiting all night.
-I don't know what you said. -Sit or we seat you.
Okay.
-Sit! -I sit.
She has nothing to do with this.
The magistrate is here. We will keep your passport.
Don't worry, you don't need it where you're going.
Hello, David.
You've only got 30 seconds before they come through that door. You have to go.
Ditch the girl. If she's with you, she's dead.
Ditch the girl. If she's with you, she's dead. Mom!
Twenty seconds, David.
Mom! Mom!
Millie.
All done. Are you okay?
-We're free to walk. -They let you go?
They let me go.
-Just like that. -Just like that.
If they let you go, then why are we running?
They strongly suggested we leave town now.
-What did they say to you? -Just asked questions.
For eight hours?
They had a lot of questions.
I really want to trust you, but--
So trust me. Let's go.
Hey, can you take us?
Get in the cab, Millie.
Millie, get in the car.
Please, please get in the cab.
That's yours.
Remember how I told you didn't need to tell me everything?
I changed my mind.
What's in the backpack?
Where did you get that?
I don't want to lie.
But you don't want to tell the truth, either.
I can't get on this flight with you. This is as far as we go together.
To Detroit?
Roland. We lost him, sir.
-How many did you send? -Two.
I said to send everyone.
She said two was enough. But they missed him.
It's like he knew we were coming.
We're searching the grid now.
Keep me informed. I'm taking a different tack.
William Rice?
IRS.
Could we... ...go inside and talk?
I don't have to ask. That's a courtesy.
So what's this about?
Your son, David.
Why? Is he in some kind of trouble?
This will go a lot swifter if you let me ask the questions.
When's the last time you saw your son?
Eight years ago.
-Eight years? -That's right.
What about friends?
-Anybody I can talk to? -He didn't have a lot of friends.
I'd like to talk to David's mother.
Me, too. If you find her, tell her I said hello.
Is that her?
Mary Rice was her name back then.
When's the last time you saw her?
-She split when the kid turned five. -Five.
Haven't heard a word since.
If I hear anything, I'll be sure to give you a holler.
No, you won't.
No, I won't.
Have you seen this new thing?
It's a new control. If you just double click....
See that? It's pretty.
Still alive, are you?
He's dead! What?! That's just great.
-There's more of them? -Hundreds more.
-There's more of them? -Hundreds more. I'm tracking ten right now. What do you care?
-What about the rest? -What about them?
Like I said, I hunt them.
-Who are these guys? -I told you, Paladins.
You told me their name but not what they want.
Simple. They want us dead. Didn't you figure that out?
-I got that much. -Good. Do you mind just, uh...?
-Why? -Because we do whatever we want.
Now can you...?
-He's dead. -Great.
Thanks.
You really don't get it.
Paladins have been killing jumpers for years, since medieval times.
They're fanatics, religious nut jobs.
The Inquisition, witch hunts, that was them.
They're smart... ...fast and organized. They'll kill anyone who gets in their way...
...fast and organized. They'll kill anyone who gets in their way...
...like your family, your friends...
...that little girlfriend you had traipsing around Rome.
They're dead. All of them.
Get used to it. It's a matter of time.
I'm getting take-away. Want some?
Somebody get some help!
Now!
-What happened? -What's going on?
Let me look. Get the paddles!
He smashed through the glass in the other room?
Are you okay? Stay still.
How is he?
-I'm not getting a pulse. -Defib!
What the hell happened here?
-Mark. -Jesus Christ.
What did you tell him? How did they know about Ann Arbor?
Stay away from me!
Was it a black guy, white hair? Was his name Roland?
Just answer the question, or... ...I'll drop you off Mount Everest.
-What did you tell him?! -What?! Tell what?!
I know you told him about Ann Arbor. Did you tell him about Millie?
I know you told him about Ann Arbor. Did you tell him about Millie? -I told him everything. -Why did you do that?!
-I told him everything. -Why did you do that?!
-Why not? -God!
Who are you?
Where'd the Paladin go?
-Swimming. -Pacific?
No, Atlantic. A nice little shark pit around Cuba.
What are you doing? Put that back.
-I need to borrow this. -Just stay away from the wall!
I'll cut your eyes out!
-I need to find Roland. -No, you don't!
I only got 8 hours.
-Her flight lands in 8 hours. -That stuff won't help. It's 4 years old.
Shall I jump you back to high school, so you can learn something?
Shall I jump you back to high school, so you can learn something? Look.
See this? Our first round in Nepal.
You should see the one he gave me in Prague.
Forget it. Forget Roland.
Don't waste your time. Just leave it to me.
You mind?
A little privacy? This is my thing.
Just, you know, turn around.
I was thinking that if we do this together...
...we could get him.
You mean like you and me?
Like we team up.
Look, I'm sorry, but I don't play well with others.
Do me a favor.
Don't be here when I get back. Find a rock, crawl under it, stay there.
Joi wooi, brother.
It's "good-bye" in Chinese.
I've been meaning to call. I still want to get the tattoo.
You can't keep following me.
Actually, I'm the one person who can.
Lucky me.
Why are you walking?
I know Tokyo. I got a lot of jump sites, so--
I like walking for a change. It makes me feel normal.
Did you ever read Marvel Team-up?
Yeah, I've read it. And?
Two superheroes joining forces for a limited run.
I see what you're trying to do. I'm not buying it.
For your own sake, just go home.
-You live in a cave. -It's called a lair. And what's the point?
I'm just saying, we kind of have this common thing.
I know where to find Roland.
So we doing this, or what?
Sorry. The clutch stuck.
You're real subtle.
I'm not gonna get rid of you, am I?
Might want to hold on, son.
That was close.
Not bad.
This thing must be two tons. How are you...?
If it moves, I can jump it.
I knew a jumper, crazy bastard, who tried to hop a whole building.
Won't be trying that again.
-Why? -'Cause he's dead.
Killed him.
He managed to shake it a little, though.
How long have you done this?
-Done what? Driven? -No, jumping.
-Since I was five. -Five?
How do you keep it secret from people, like your parents?
It's easy when they're not around.
-Where were they? -Not around.
My mom took off when I was five.
I know what it's like to not.... My dad, he....
Did I ask about your family?
I mean, are we on Oprah?
I can't keep doing this! I have to go.
Her flight's landing soon. I need an answer.
This is it. Marvel Team-Up, now or never.
A very limited run, right?
Save her, kill him. We're done.
All right, Spidey.
Due to increased security measures, all bags are subject to search.
Detroit International Airport...
...asks you to keep your bags in your possession at all times.
Her flight landed an hour ago.
Oh, no.
You didn't check the flight.
We have to find her.
You find her. I'll arm up. Meet me back at the lair.
Fine.
What're you looking at?
Boo!
Hey. I'm Millie's friend, David.
Is she here?
Last I checked, she was with you.
Hey! Your friend came by.
What?
Black guy, white hair. You just missed him.
Come on.
Jesus.
David...
...what the hell are you doing here?
I buzzed, but you didn't pick up.
So you broke in?
To make sure you were okay.
No, I'm not okay.
I got left in an airport in Rome.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
Thank you.
I think you should leave.
David, you need to leave!
Snap to it. We don't have much time.
What are you doing?
David, I told you to leave.
"Um", what?
-I'm not in banking. -No, really?
I mean, the money did come from a bank. A few banks, actually.
Are you telling me you're a bank robber?
That's a small part.
Get out of my house!
Millie, I'm sorry.
-We have to go. -Leave me alone!
Come on!
This might hurt a bit.
It's okay.
Trust me, okay?
-The first jump's a bit rough. -Get away.
Don't come near me!
I'll explain everything, okay?
In here.
Just stay where you are. Stay there.
Hurry up! It's closing!
Griffin!
I have to tell you something.
You find her?
-It's going to piss you off. -Piss me off?
What is this?
What is she doing here?! This isn't some kind of clubhouse!
What is she doing here?! This isn't some kind of clubhouse! You want to see the top of Mount Everest? Maybe the bottom?
You want to see the top of Mount Everest? Maybe the bottom?
Griffin, listen to me.
By bringing her here, they can follow you! They have a machine.
-It can open wormholes. -What do you mean?
-It can open wormholes. -What do you mean? They can follow us anywhere!
And you brought her here!
Oh, shit.
There's two of you? What is going on?
Millie, stay here!
What have you done?
Where does this thing go?
Holy shit.
Mom?
Thanks for leading me to your friend.
Wait! Why are you doing this to me?
I never hurt you. I never hurt anybody.
Not yet, but you will.
Sooner or later, you all go bad.
What if I'm different?
-You're not different. -I'm different.
Boo!
Move!
It's time to send you home to Mommy.
David?
Millie, get out of here. Run, okay?
Millie, run!
I'm freeing you so you can get me home.
Okay.
Can you take me now?
Okay, I'll take you, and...
...I'll leave you alone.
It was always you, though.
Ever since we were five. It was always you.
Please just take me.
Take a deep breath.
I got it! I trapped them there.
Without the machine, they're screwed!
Got her!
Shit!
Bloody.... Wow.
Crap. I didn't expect that. I didn't know.
Now they have to come to us.
Get these fires out.
What's that?
What are you doing?
I was thinking about going bowling.
Roland's in there with his whole army.
Roland's in there with his whole army. I'm gonna go back there and blow 'em to Timbuktu.
I'm gonna go back there and blow 'em to Timbuktu.
Millie's in there.
-Well, there is that as well. -I have to go get her.
It's my fault that she's there.
-What? -We have to get her out of there.
-We have to get her! -I heard you! I'm not deaf!
I can actually hear.
It's a crying shame, but we all have to make sacrifices.
You know.
Where's the detonator?
-You're not making any. -I made mine.
Alright?
When I was five.
He came to my house and killed my parents.
David, David.
Let's just talk about this.
How about this for talking? Am I getting the message through to you?
I can't let you do this.
Touch this safe again and I'll kill you. Have you got it?
Give me the detonator, David!
Give it back! Sorry, Griffin!
Give it back!
Don't.
Bad move.
Oh, shit.
I hate Chechnya!
Where'd you go?
Well then, brother, I guess our limited run is done.
The old electricity trick? That was a nice move.
Thanks.
Cut me down and we can finish this.
It didn't have to be this way.
There's five of them back there! You go back alone, you're dead! You can't win!
Get me down!
Do this alone and you're dead!
You're not a hero, David!
You're a jumper! We don't save the girl!
Don't you get it?
Out of the way!
-Throw a tether! -Got him!
There are some things you can't jump!
Only God should have this power.
Not you, David.
David, I'm so sorry about what I said before.
Take a deep breath.
David?
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -Where are we?
Why is my dishwasher in the library?
I'm impressed.
Stay here.
You've come a long way from robbing banks.
I told you I'm different.
I could have dropped you with the sharks.
Can I help you?
Is Mary here?
Mom?
Honey, wait upstairs.
-It wasn't easy finding you. -You shouldn't be here.
So it's true.
You're one of them.
Yes, it's true.
You were five years old, your first jump. I had two choices:
Kill you or leave you.
So you left.
To protect you.
I was five.
I did what I had to do.
I've never stopped thinking about you, not even for one day.
-So I'm a jumper, you're a Paladin. -That's right.
What now?
I'm giving you a head start, son.
Because I love you.
Good luck.
-You okay? -Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah, I am.
You're really something.
Really?
Because that's not the sort of thing
that my boyfriend would say.
You know me.
I mean what I say.
You're just saying that
because I'm drunk and you're drunk.
How many times do I have to tell you?
You're kind, intelligent, and beautiful.
Who wouldn't fall for you?
I'm drunk. This is so embarrassing.
More like hilarious.
You know I love Basha.
I have a boyfriend, Popoy! Hello.
But you said you weren't happy with him anymore.
Yes! That's why we're here. That's why I got us a room.
I never said I wanted to have sex with you.
I said I needed to take a dump and throw up.
You said you had a room here we could use.
Go home! Go.
We're still friends, right?
Of course! Besides, you did way more embarrassing stuff in high school.
Could we not go there, please?
Helen, can you not tell Basha about this?
Basha, wait.
Basha! Your jacket.
Dude, nothing happened.
Bash! Sorry! I was at work.
Bash?
Chinno, code red. Basha and Popoy.
Just let them break up.
Why? What is it this time?
-Hi, hon. -Oh, OK.
Hon, can you please call Popoy?
What happened this time?
Hello, Ken! I need a drink.
Poy, are you OK?
Where are you?
-Here. -Where?
-Here. I'll just get a beer. -OK.
-Dude, want us to beat him up? -Already did.
Let's beat him up again.
We'll do it till you aren't pissed anymore.
He's the guilty one and he has the nerve to get mad.
Maybe he didn't do anything wrong.
What if he did?
But I didn't.
Dude, are you blind?
Dude, it's Helen.
-If I had a best friend like her-- -You'd go for her?
Why not? Isn't that why you brought her to the hotel?
Jackass! That's where she's staying.
The three of us were supposed to have dinner
but Basha had to be a drama queen.
For five years I've been either the welcoming committee
or the planner of Helen's farewell parties.
Did I ever complain?
No.
I just asked him to be there for me this one time
because I'm so mad at my boss.
But did he go with me?
No.
Then he cheats on me.
Bash, it's Popoy.
He can't stand the thought of hurting you.
Maybe it was just as friends.
It's Basha, after all.
-In a hotel? -In a hotel?
If they needed to talk
they didn't have to get a hotel room for it.
Poy, do you honestly believe that?
I don't know.
Then just stop acting so jealous of Helen.
Why don't you just explain to Popoy how you ended up in the hotel room?
But he never listens to me.
Whenever we have a problem, he always has to be right
and I'm always wrong.
Because you let him get away with it.
Because I love him. If that's the case,
then just apologize to each other so we can get on with the wedding.
Are you serious?
Why should I say sorry when I didn't do anything wrong?
Right! Basha betrayed him.
Knowing you…
Poy, you can't stand being away from her for too long.
-Just forgive her. -This way man…
It's her fault! She should say sorry.
Basha.
Poy!
This is why they always fight.
How can she get married to someone so possessive?
Stingy.
Practical.
He never listens.
See?
He just loves her very much.
It's suffocating.
-Exactly. -Hello?
Poy, dude.
-Popoy's on his way down. -More beer? I'll get it.
Don't let him come down. We have a call of nature emergency.
Dude, this is your night.
-Let me do it. -Poy is on his way down.
I can't take it anymore.
So controlling.
Who's controlling? Me?
Basha, you're the stubborn one.
I told you to come with me.
But you refused. Because you had a date with Francis?
Popoy, Francis and I didn't do anything wrong.
-We didn't do what you think we did. -What were you doing then?
Thumb wrestling?
Wait. Let's talk about this.
He just accompanied Basha when you chose to go with Helen.
And because it was Francis' birthday, he treated her to dinner.
But she ate too much steamed crab and had to go to the bathroom desperately.
Luckily, Francis had a free room in the hotel
and he let Basha use his bathroom.
Basha, if you're going to lie, you might as well think up a good one.
Poy, can you listen to Basha first?
Why don't you try to understand her?
And who understands you? Francis?
You know what, Poy?
This is pointless.
What?
Come on, Basha! Just say it.
-Want to break up? Fine. -Hey.
I'm sure we can still fix this, Poy.
Now do you believe her?
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
Move.
You can't take this.
-It's my favorite. -I want it as a souvenir.
That toothbrush is mine. I bought it.
Here.
And these? These are mine, right?
I had those developed.
Fine! Take it.
Wait.
This is mine.
No, it's mine.
You gave it to me as an anniversary gift which makes it mine.
Fine! It's all yours.
Here we are breaking up and you still want to be in control.
Bash, that's enough.
I heard that.
-Popoy. -Come on, that's enough.
Let me go.
Please put that down, and the ones you took from the bedroom.
I'm sorry.
I believe you now.
I had to fart and be humiliated just so you'd believe me.
That's why I'm asking for your forgiveness. Please?
Poy.
I'm sorry too.
Nothing happened between me and Francis, really.
Poy.
Poy.
-Popoy, we haven't made up yet. -Basha, it's getting hot in here.
Hot you say?
Popoy, don't come near me!
-Popoy. -Come here.
Basha.
-Popoy… -Basha…
Popoy…
I'm coming.
Basha…
Basha…
Popoy, you can do that later…
Popoy, you can do that later…
-I still need to fix the costings… -Do it tomorrow, please?
Popoy.
Hello? -Yes, sir, still awake, sir. -Popoy…
Why…
Bash, wait.
-There's a problem at the site. -Fix it later…
OK, I'll go there myself.
Bash, I need to go to the site. They're having problems.
Bash…
OK, let's do it…
but only for 15 minutes.
Go ahead.
They might be waiting for you already.
I'm OK, just go.
Bash, baby.
Basha…
You know that I'm doing this for our wedding, right?
Kiss me now.
C'mon.
Come on! Get dressed and I'll take you home.
Bash, I don't want us to say goodbye like this.
I already said 15 minutes but you didn't want to…
It's not about that.
Is this about the hotel?
No.
Then what?
I'm exhausted.
Bash, we all get tired.
I get tired from working too.
But, we have to focus.
You have to keep your eyes on the goal.
Poy, you don't understand.
That's not the problem.
-It's just-- -Wait, it's my boss calling.
Sir, yes, I'm on my way.
Yes, sir, really on the way.
Bash, I love you, you love me.
What's the problem? Nothing, right?
Go on, go inside.
Wake up, sleepyhead.
You can't be late.
It's train day today.
-We'll go by Helen's too. -Okay.
We don't want her to be late for her flight.
You have to be in the office by 8:30, too.
Come on, wake up, or you'll be late again.
Can I stay home from work today?
-Why? Are you sick? -No. It's just that…
-about last night… I was saying… -Oh, that thing…
Basha, you can't miss work today.
Your presentation is today, right?
You know how temperamental your boss is.
Do you want to get fired or something?
OK, I'm going to work.
Come on, get up.
I love you.
Smells good.
Isn't my baby just the sweetest?
That's why I keep telling you to buy her a ring already
before she realizes that she doesn't want to marry you next year, or ever.
Do you?
Do you still need one, Bash?
She doesn't need one because I'm too perfect.
You're so sure of yourself, aren't you? Poy, please.
He's not going to buy me a ring because it's too expensive.
That's why you should have taken that job in Qatar,
so you could have bought Basha a proper engagement ring.
Time to go. Let's go, Bash.
Take care of yourself, OK?
And call me when you can.
Why didn't you take the train?
Because, if I did, I wouldn't have been able to follow your schedule.
I shouldn't have brought my pickup, then.
We're wasting gas. Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Why didn't you tell me about this offer from Qatar?
Bash… Because I have no plans of working there.
Bash, do I really have to go abroad to earn money?
-Besides, we both have jobs here anyway-- -What if I resign?
There you go again, Bash.
What are you going to do?
You're going to waste your college degree just making T-shirts?
At least they're my own designs.
Bash, we're getting married next year.
You think raising a family is easy?
You can't resign.
So I can't make decisions about your job,
but you can make decisions about mine?
Bash… come on.
Bash, the boss has been looking for you.
He's fuming mad already.
What's that about?
How many times do I have to tell you, you're not supposed to think.
I'm the boss, you're not.
All you needed to do was copy the plan, but you couldn't even do that!
Don't think you're smarter than me.
I told you, I don't want the gazebo to appear in the middle of the pool
I told you, I don't want the gazebo to appear in the middle of the pool in the model scale.
Here! Tell me you revised the scale model
we're going to present later already.
If I get humiliated later,
-Poy, let's go. -Straighten out your plan, Basha.
If you want to stay in this business,
He wants to fire me? Fine.
I'll be happy to go! This job is fit for a stupid moron anyway.
Can't he see why I keep changing his plans?
Has he even heard of the word "aesthetics?"
Why don't you just resign, then?
Then she'll get in trouble with Popoy.
Poor Basha…
That's Popoy calling.
Bash, have you changed the plans yet?
-Poy, I don't want to-- -Basha, stop being so stubborn.
Basha, your job is very easy.
All you needed to do was copy the plan,
-but you couldn't even do that. -We still need to find it.
Aw, poor kid. She has two bosses.
Everything OK now?
I don't think she wants to change it.
Sir.
-Hello? Jethro, man, sorry to disturb you. -Sir.
Have you talked to Basha yet?
Yes, she called me a while ago. She already revised the model.
Dude. What she said was wrong.
The model needs to be reset to the original plan.
-Sir, it's OK now, sir. -Jethro, thank you very much.
OK, sir.
so that visitors will enjoy the viewing deck more.
It's a good thing we got that model fixed
-or we would both be in trouble. -I would be in trouble.
You think I'd ever let that happen?
Don't let your emotions rule you. You'll end up hurt that way.
Then you'll complain that you're tired of it.
Don't forget your 7 p.m. deadline.
We don't want to be late for dinner at Kenneth's…
Bash.
Just this once.
You know that's bad for you. It's high in cholesterol.
Poy, just this once.
-What's wrong with you? -Here.
What's your problem?
There. Space.
Eat.
Lover's quarrel.
Anj, stop messing with the food. It'll taste like instant noodles again.
Then don't eat it.
Poy, I thought everything was OK. Where's Basha?
At work. She's finishing something.
What?
OK, I'm on my way.
Basha's car broke down.
She asked me to pick her up.
Why didn't she call you?
Maybe she's with another dude and doesn't want to get caught.
Shut up.
Are you OK?
Why are you here?
Because I'm your boyfriend.
What did I tell you?
If you hadn't driven your car, we wouldn't be here--
-Poy I can do this. -Why did you call Anj anyway?
-Poy, let it go. Poy, I can do it. -Let me do it, Bash.
-I can do this. -Bash…
Poy!
I give up, Poy.
I don't know if what I'm doing is right.
All I know is that we have to end this.
Basha, if this is about your job again,
I understand.
I just don't want everything you studied and worked so hard for to go to waste.
Popoy, it's easy for you to say that because you're not in my shoes.
You don't know what it's like
to see all that effort go into something you can't even call your own.
Bash. I know it's hard,
but we both know this is the only way
for us to reach your dreams, our dreams.
What if this isn't what I want?
What if I don't want to be an architect anymore?
What if I pursued this because I fell in love with you?
but we stick to this, to what's safe, to what's OK?
Do you really believe that?
I don't know…
but I know something's wrong if I'm asking these questions.
It's almost as if
there wouldn't be a Basha without a Popoy.
Poy!
Poy. I want to find a life and a job
where I know my worth.
not just because you think it's what's best for us.
But I can't do that when you've got everything planned out.
I can't even solve my own problems
because you solve them for me.
It feels as if I'm surrendering everything to you.
It's suffocating me.
It's exhausting.
Thanks.
Let me.
Poy, just let Basha be.
She's OK,
we're getting the car fixed.
Krizzy and I will bring her home, OK?
OK.
Was I wrong?
Am I a horrible person?
Go! Make up with him. Then break up again.
Then get back together again,
then break up again.
Anj, shouldn't we help them fix this?
Popoy's our friend too.
Krizzy, they can't fix this if Basha is not OK.
And Basha will never be fine as long as they are together.
What happens tomorrow?
I'd usually tell you to try and fix things.
But if this is really what both of you need, then just be strong.
It's going to be painful and difficult, but hopefully…
Bash, what are you doing?
Basha, talk to me.
Bash, wait up.
Bash.
Do you really want to get away from me so much you have to do this?
-Basha. -Because this is what I want.
What about us?
What about our plans?
The wedding?
I thought you said nothing would change.
Basha, what about us?
There's no more "us", Popoy.
That's it?
You're just going to throw that all away?
You're not going to give me another chance to fix this?
You want to disappear from my life.
Basha…
Even if it's hard, let's fix this.
you know I'm trying, right?
Bash wait, just wait.
You know it's easy to give up, but you're not a quitter.
Poy, I need this.
You need it, too.
But I need you.
Bash.
Bash!
Wait… Is that so? Here it comes.
-Oh, no. -Quick.
Use the umbrella.
Open it fast!
You're already wet.
Ten years from now, do you think we'll still be like this?
Maybe it's Basha at the door.
-Basha sent this. -Sorry, wrong girl.
Morning.
Thank you, ma'am.
-Dude, let's go. -Let's go out.
Time to get back in the dating game.
-I don't want to. -Let's go, man.
Hey, Babe.
Poy, this is my good friend Babe.
Babe, this is Popoy.
I'M NO LONGER TENSE
Mommy, look at this.
'COZ IT'S ALREADY PAST TENSE
Turn around, sis. Is it OK? What do you think?
Poy, wear these.
Don't bother. My feet are already wet, anyway.
Mom, we need to buy sealant to stop the leak.
All right! Panying.
Mommy, is the plumber here? I'm already late for my meeting.
Mom, let's not force the issue please.
-Popoy is an engineer. -You're an engineer?
Just ten seconds, promise.
Just one look, please…
Bash, where are you?
-You broke up with Popoy, but not with us. -Yeah.
Sorry, Krizzy, I have to pass.
OK, but we haven't seen you in two months.
We miss you.
OK. But next Thursday, please, try to be here.
-Tell Popoy Basha's not coming. -I figured…
Poy, she's not coming.
You think she'll talk to me if I get sick?
That's stupid, man. Let's go.
Kenneth!
What do you think, Chi?
If I get sick and end up in the hospital, she'll talk to me.
-Poy. -Chinno.
Poy, let's go. Let's just talk about it inside.
She'll take me back if I get sick.
She's not coming back. Let's go in. It's just a girl.
C'mon, man…
-Poy. -Chinno, Poy, what's going on? Stop.
-Ass. -Stop it! Let him be.
-Excuse me. -Sorry.
One message from her mom, and I'm there.
One text message.
It's stopped raining.
Take care. Bye!
Are you OK?
Come on, stand up.
Keys?
Why are you so kind?
At least you're concerned about me.
You're lost, right?
So, what are you doing here?
I'm just looking at the house.
This one is owned by a man without any plans to start a family.
Why do you say that?
The house is not kid-friendly.
It has too many edges,
and the materials are too masculine, too tough.
If I were the architect, I would suggest that…
I'd lessen the edges and put more curves to balance it out.
Maybe that's why my ex-girlfriend left me.
That's what she said when I designed this house.
That I had no plans to settle down.
This is your house?
Mark Yaneza. The man who has no plans to start a family.
You're an architect?
Used to be.
There's just a few of us here,
So?
-Thanks, ma'am. -Why don't you show her to her desk?
-Thank you so much, ma'am. -Sure, ma'am.
-Welcome to the office. Good luck. -Thank you.
They say it's bad luck to display your boyfriend's picture in the office.
It's empty.
But there was a picture before?
Before.
-Maybe that's why you and… -Beng.
Beng broke up,
because you put her picture on your table.
If only that were the case. Then I could fix it easily.
I'm not going to make my opening.
Does he even have plans of finishing this?
Where is Engineer Gonzales?
Sir…
-OK. I'll leave first. -Thank you, ma'am.
I really love this office now.
Yes.
That's why I'm saying, thank you for this opportunity.
You know the feeling of everything being new?
New office,
new friends,
new me.
Everything feels new.
Just don't forget that I'm your first new friend in your new life.
Of course! You're my first new friend.
You know, you sound like me three months ago.
Well, it's an exciting time, Basha,
So, don't ever forget the old you.
Of course.
It's OK. I have to go somewhere else first.
Come on, no big deal.
Huh? Where are you…
White car? Is this you?
-Krizzy, I've missed you so much. -Bash.
-No. -Hi.
-Hi. -This is Mark, my new officemate.
-Mark, this is Krizzy, my friend. -Nice to meet you.
-Come on, let's go in. -Actually, I'm just dropping her off.
I insist. Come on, let's go.
Come on! So you can meet the people in my old life.
Come on. You'll enjoy the food.
Chinno, she isn't the girl I saw you with the other day.
Funny, dude.
Basha Belinda Eugenio.
How are you?
-Behave. -This is Mark.
-Bash, how are you? -I'm OK.
Kenneth.
How are you?
Bash, my date Cathy.
-This is Mark, my new officemate. -Dude.
-This is Kenneth, Cathy, then Chinno. -Hi.
-Popoy's here. -What?
He's going to make a scene, for sure.
-Popoy's not like that. -I'm so sorry, I didn't know.
I know him.
Just relax.
Poy.
Poy.
Ken.
-Poy. Come here. -I hope I'm not late.
Bash?
Popoy, this is Mark my new officemate.
Mark, bro.
-Let's eat. -Come on.
-Thank you. -Let's eat.
Are you okay?
-Thanks, Poy. -What do you want?
-Hon, let's eat. -Guys…
-Poy. -Dude.
Wait…
Sit here, Poy.
It's hot.
Yay! You've been blind for five years.
You're the first person I met who celebrates his blindness anniversary.
For Kenneth, he gained more than what he lost when he became blind.
-That's deep. -Very funny.
-Bash. -Thanks, Poy.
Hon, let's just open gifts.
-Chinno? -Yeah, let's do that.
JP?
The cake's my gift.
Of course, thank you, Anj.
-Thanks, Bash. -You're welcome.
Hon, Basha has a gift! Let's open it.
Wow, that's beautiful.
-So am I. -Wow, that is sweet.
Thanks, Basha.
-No wonder your shirts are big hits. -Nice!
If they're such big hits…
then why did she go back to being an architect?
Is there some rule against that?
Nothing wrong with that.
I just thought
You wanted something else, right?
Is this your new boyfriend?
Guess what guys! Krizzy's pregnant.
Congrats!
Congratulations!
I'll be a godfather.
Godfather? You?
We should congratulate Basha, too.
Congratulations, Basha. Finally, you've found someone to replace me.
Finally, you've found someone to replace me.
Chinno, Kenneth, let's drink to that.
Dude.
-That's enough, dude. -Let's go outside.
Wait, Chi.
-Let's go outside first… -You don't want to?
Let's talk about this outside.
-Wait. -Poy.
Don't you know the three-month rule?
Everyone who has ever fallen in love and broken up knows that.
You have to let three months pass first
before you find another boyfriend…
Don't you know that?
-Poy, enough. -I'm not done, Chinno.
I still have two weeks left.
Why are you in such a hurry to replace me?
Poy, that's enough.
Let's go outside.
Poy, that's enough.
Man, I don't want trouble.
Poy, that's enough.
You may be bigger than me, but you can't put me down.
Popoy! Just go home.
-Wait. -Just go home.
I did everything.
Everything. What else do you want me to do?
Fuck this.
Are you really that heartless?
Huh? Tell me! For God's sake, tell me.
-Tell me. -Popoy, that's enough.
Basha.
I love you so much.
And it hurts too much.
What are you waiting for? Take me.
Take me now!
Where are you?
I've been going around in circles, where are you?
I'm coming.
You keep saying that but you're still not here.
I am coming.
Yeah, right.
Where are you?
-Big bro. -Silly you…
I thought you were going ahead.
Oh, you. What? Where?
Bash.
Are you going home with us?
No, Mom, you guys go ahead.
He has a date with his baby.
Just make sure you come home later. I have a surprise for you.
Wow. OK, we'll see.
I'll go ahead. Bye! Take care.
-Bye, Mom. -Bye, bro.
Bye! Take care.
Take care.
-Sorry. -Excuses.
-You're late again. -I'll make it up to you.
-I have a surprise. -What?
-You're finally marrying Beng. -Yes.
And you wonder why the office gossip is always about you two.
Architect, so many people ask me who built my palace.
I don't know if they want one themselves,
or if they just want to be set up on a date.
And already people are lining up to work with our Basha.
-Poy. -Chinno.
-Bro. -Dude, how are you?
JP, how are you?
-I'm OK. -How's Anj?
What about Ken and Krizzy? Are they still pissed off?
They were never mad at you Poy.
You look good man.
If I'd known getting fired could make you look this good,
I'd have tried it…
So, what are you doing now? Where do you work?
Nothing permanent.
Mom's making me consider Qatar, but I'm still thinking about it.
Now that we've found you,
you can't miss dinner on Thursday.
I have a special announcement to make.
-Wait, what's your new number? -Your number?
-091- -Baby.
Wait, huh?
My gosh! She has the same haircut as Basha.
What did we tell you? They look alike.
-She looks like a mini-Basha. -Can I see?
-Is she sexy? -Hon.
-Hot, dude. -What's that? What are you looking at?
-Hi, Basha! -I'll get you a juice, just wait.
Porn! It's Chinno's.
Why did you give it to Kenneth…
Popoy looks good.
Who's the girl in the picture?
That's Popoy's new baby.
Bash, are you OK?
Of course.
I'm glad he's moved on.
-There! You heard that. You all heard it. -Can I have some?
So Popoy can come on Thursday. Everybody should be there.
-Basha, you have to be there. -Sure.
Aunt Edith?
-Popoy. -Auntie Edith.
Aunt!
-Aunt! -Oh, my dear!
My nephew is really so handsome.
Why didn't you say you were coming?
We wanted to surprise you.
-Poy. -Uncle Willie.
How are you?
-You OK? Do you have a headache? -Slight.
Bernice, I have Biogesic tablets inside my bag. Can you get one please?
-Have a seat first. -Thank you.
-Don't worry about it. It'll disappear. -Babs.
I think I have jetlag, Babs.
My poor Babsy.
Willie, why don't you rest first?
-The room's ready. -Why not?
Uncle, drink this.
-Thank you. -Then take a rest after.
Come on, I have so many gifts for you.
Uncle, let's talk later.
-I'll come back for you. Later. -Take a rest.
-So many… -Wait…
-Wait, Bernice. -Wait! This is mine.
-And these are for Basha. -Wow. I love--
I thought you'd get married first.
When's the wedding?
When the house is done.
Wow! You have a house now? Where?
We don't have one yet.
And it looks like it's going to take longer.
Didn't you and Basha promise you'd make our house?
What to do now?
Popoy can still make the house,
but you'll have to find a new architect.
Willie and I don't have the budget for a new architect.
That's how it is, Babs. Let's just look for someone else.
No! If I have to talk to Basha, I will.
Babs, think of Popoy.
No.
I'm OK with it.
It won't be a problem.
See?
Congratulations. You're on fire.
-Thanks. -Where do you want to eat?
-My treat. Don't say no. -Watch it.
-Sorry. -Beng and I have a date.
I have to get back in her friends' good graces.
They keep saying she's committing emotional suicide by accepting me back.
Isn't it true?
-Whatever. -Just kidding.
Good luck winning over Beng's friends.
Who?
-Bashing. -Auntie Edith.
You've grown more beautiful.
Such a shame my nephew let you go.
-How did you find me? -Popoy.
He's not here.
So, why did you come home?
Because of the wedding.
Whose wedding?
Mine and your Uncle Willie's.
I'm here for your promise.
Our dream house.
Of course! I'll design it? Sure.
Yes, you'll design it and Popoy will be the engineer.
No problem with me… as long as he agrees.
It's OK with him. No problem.
I knew you loved me that much.
I thought we'd see each other later. Don't you have dinner with Chinno?
I feel like being with you.
It's a Thursday.
And what is Thursday for?
Music day.
But can't it be another Popoy day?
Baby, I also have to give time for my music.
-I want to introduce you to them-- -Poy, you can do it.
You can do it.
I wrote that for you.
Those are just the lyrics.
I'm saving the music for our second monthsary.
You forgot, didn't you?
Poy.
Looks like you don't need it.
Go now, before I change my mind.
Cathy, come here. Look at my baby.
-Oh, my, aren't we excited? -May I see?
Is that my goddaughter?
Is that my baby you're fussing about?
-She looks like me, man. -Do I look like him?
-No, bro. -Yes.
Hon, is Popoy coming?
Are you OK?
Sorry. They slipped from my fingers…
Did you all miss me?
-Popoy. -Poy.
Ken.
Chi, what's your big announcement?
Is it on? Is it OK?
-What? -I'm not sure…
-Yuck Chinno. -What's that? A text quote?
It's an original! My original.
Wait, who could forget this?
-I have a surprise for you. -Wait…
Hon, they're making fun of you.
Wait, listen.
-Will you marry me? -Oh my gosh!
A little something-something, love.
Chi, congrats!
Chinno, are you sure you didn't just rush Cathy into this?
Anj, it's not about the length of time.
There are some people who've been together for ages
but they end up separating, right, Poy?
But, I'm not talking about you, Poy.
Or Basha.
So stop overreacting.
It's OK. Chi, congrats.
-Thanks. -Cathy, good luck.
Thank you.
How mean.
Don't listen to him.
Silly!
-Chinno, give her food. -Let's eat.
What do you want, baby?
Hon, what do you want?
Take care! Krizzy come on.
Wait, help Kenneth, 'cause I still have to lock the door.
-I'll do it. -Sure.
Bye.
Take care!
See you! Chi.
At the site.
I'll be fine. Are you gonna be OK?
Sorry for disturbing you,
I'm just so confused.
It's Popoy.
Popoy?
When did I become an expert on him?
You're a guy.
Mark, we saw each other at Kenneth's.
He didn't shout at me.
And he was so nice and friendly.
He even kissed me before we left.
Why did he do that?
What does that mean?
What's wrong with that?
Mark, you were there when he screamed at me.
He nearly killed me in his rage. You saw that.
What happened?
Maybe he's OK now.
OK as in he's not mad at me anymore?
Bash, OK as in, he's accepted that you're not getting back together ever.
Maybe he's moved on.
You think?
Auntie! Uncle! Sorry I'm late.
It took the shuttle so long to leave.
Where's your car?
-I left it at the shop. -Again?
Basha, what do you think about our love nest?
It's full of weeds?
-Look for the marker there. -Yes, Dad!
Watch what you're doing.
What are you doing?
Helping.
You'll get rashes.
Then I'll scratch them.
On heels?
I can do it.
Ready to quit?
I'm fine.
-What is it? -What happened?
Bash? What's wrong? Did I hurt you?
Nice view, huh?
She's going to be excited when she sees you.
Elvie, your ex-future daughter-in-law is here.
Basha! Is that you?
How are you? You look so beautiful.
-You too. -New hair!
Basha, my child.
-You look really good! How are you? -I'm fine.
Why didn't you tell me Basha was with you?
I'd have bought her favorite rice cake if I'd known she was coming.
-It's supposed to be a surprise. -It's OK. I have to go now.
I still have to go home.
You're going home this late? I won't allow it.
-I can use public transport. -You have to drive her home.
Oh, no, it's OK. I don't want to hassle Popoy.
He'll have to get gas, then pay the toll.
It's going to cost a lot.
-No need. I'm OK. -No, I insist. You have to drive her.
It's really OK.
-Poy, you don't have to. -Come on, Bash.
-You heard him. -Go.
Let's go?
Let's go.
Good thing we took this route. The traffic on the highway is horrible.
-Excuse me. -Oh, sorry.
Are you cold?
Yeah.
New car.
You must have lots of money.
Nope.
Just had a lot of leftover savings from…
That's Tricia's.
Is she an engineer?
Does she know…
Yeah.
In fact she's excited to see the house…
Wow.
Really?
How long have you been together?
One month, uh, Thursday.
I was supposed to pick her up after our dinner
but she had another gig.
She likes it when I pick her up, like I'm still courting her.
And whenever I'm late…
But you're never late…
Well, I am now.
When I'm late, it's war.
And it's so hard to make peace with her.
I have to give her everything she asks for.
But that's it. She's the boss.
How about you and Mark?
How long have you been together?
He was never my boyfriend.
Here, ma'am. Are you going to buy it?
-Yes, here it is… -This is good quality.
All right.
I'm buying this one. Look OK?
Wow.
-I got this. It's OK. -Taking it?
No, here…
It's OK.
How are you two?
Who?
You and Basha?
Have you done the plans?
Not yet.
But we know what to do
because we know what Auntie wants.
It's gonna be easy.
That's good.
That means you'll finish soon.
Why did you throw this away? It's pretty.
There's something missing.
This one too. It's really good.
It doesn't suit the lot.
Look at the lot.
It doesn't fit the lot.
Who's your client anyway?
Popoy's aunt.
And Popoy is the engineer?
Yes.
Bash, that's how I was when I saw Beng for the first time after the break up.
I was trying too hard to impress her.
I'm not trying hard to impress him.
Am I that obvious?
Guys, who wants orange cake?
-Yes, for sure. -How about you, JP?
Anj, Basha and Mark never got together?
Never.
That's what happens when you don't ask.
Are you sure?
I feel like something's missing.
-This is where Aunt Edith commented. -Here, Hon, I'll give you some.
Looks like it lacks something.
Poy, what if we lessen the walkway
to maximize the space.
-Could we do that? -Of course.
That's what we did with our house, so let's just do it to this one.
What else?
I like that.
Me too.
Bash, Auntie Edith called.
She's asking when we can make the presentation of the final plans.
-Not now please. -Hello?
Not now please.
Bash, am I calling at a bad time?
No! My car is breaking down…
Where are you?
I'm at Visayas Ave.
Wait just a moment.
Why did you get out?
The towing service is coming. Wait.
Here, let's go!
Bash, this way.
Hurry.
Here's a tissue.
You know, you're lucky you were on our way,
otherwise you'd have been stuck there.
Baby, your shirt is wet.
Are you going to tell me about it or do I have to guess?
I knew he'd found someone new.
But it only became real tonight.
And it hurts so much.
You have to elevate this.
And the walkway is too wide.
Why didn't you tell me that the last time we saw each other
instead of complaining about it now?
The materials you chose are all too expensive.
Why did you change the costings
without consulting me or Auntie Edith first?
Because it's my job to meet the budget of the clients.
But you can't change the materials just because you want to cut costs.
I think you're too pressured by the timetable.
It's not worth arguing about it. Don't worry about it.
You're going to ruin the overall aesthetics of the design.
-Aesthetics is pointless… -Pointless?
Popoy, I thought about those details, so don't tell me they're pointless
simply because you find them expensive.
You make it sound as if I don't care.
I only want to make sure we can build this very impossible house you want.
What?
I'm with Uncle Willie and Auntie Edith.
I have to go back to the office.
My battery's running low…
-Wait. I'll call you later. -Bye.
Basha wait. Let's talk about the revisions.
You left your plans.
I'll take care of it. I'll just text you.
Can you at least try to be professional?
I am being professional about this.
Yes, I can see that.
Why are you being like this?
Because I'm commenting on your plans?
I'm not upset. I'm fine.
-There you go again. -There I go what again?
There.
Saying that there's no problem when there is.
Because there isn't.
How can I fix the problem if you're not going to tell me what it is?
If I don't know what it is?
Popoy, you can't solve every problem.
And believe me, you don't want to know what my problem is.
-Just tell me what's wrong. -You really want to know?
It's me, Popoy.
I'm the problem.
Because I'm hurting even though I know I shouldn't be.
I wish I could just pretend I'm OK and that this isn't painful.
After all, I wanted this…
I wish that I could say
I'm happy for you…
for both of you.
How I wish I could…
How I wish I could…
But I can't.
And I feel so horrible…
because the truth is, I'm still hoping that you'll tell me…
that it's me…
that it's always been me…
that it's me you still love.
I love Tricia.
I know.
I know.
And you threw it all away.
Is that what you really think?
I give up! Let me go, I'll kill you all.
-Damn love. -Chi, that's enough. It's just a girl.
-What happened? -Cathy left him.
He tried to kill himself with three bottles of shampoo.
Damn that shampoo. I should be dead by now.
You say that because you don't know how I feel.
-Chi, we're here for you, we understand-- -You don't understand me.
Only Popoy understands me.
Where's Popoy?
Popoy?
Popoy, man.
-Chi… -Popoy.
Poy. I don't know.
I don't know, man.
I give up.
I didn't know it could hurt this much.
I give up.
Chinno, you can do it.
If I got through it, you can get through it.
Remember when it was me in that hellhole?
You said, "Maybe…
the ones we love leave us…
because someone else is supposed to come into our lives…
and they'll love us more.
They won't hurt us or leave us.
They'll be the one to right all the wrongs…
in our lives."
HERE'S THE PLAN. IT'S DONE.
I thought you were at the hospital…
JP's there.
Here are the plans.
They're all done.
If you want to change something, you don't have to consult with me.
You know what to do.
You always have.
Popoy…
I'm sorry because I hurt you.
I didn't mean to.
I didn't mean to.
I get married and you stop talking to me.
How I wish I could turn back time so I could fix all my mistakes…
I know Popoy got hurt, but you said sorry for that, right?
Besides, the break up did both of you good.
Bash, sometimes…
Bash, you can now face anything that comes your way.
-Sir, here's your change. -Thank you.
Sir, are you done?
I finished my song for you.
Will you read it for me?
Popoy, just say it.
Trish…
There's no easy way to do this…
because it already hurts too much.
So, just please tell me the truth.
Do you love me?
Trish, you know I love you.
Do you love her?
I can't stand seeing you hurt.
Now you won't see if you hurt me.
Do you love her?
Do you want us to end this?
Can you ever forgive me?
You're not the only one who got hurt.
Basha was hurting too and we saw that.
She never wanted to hurt you.
You got hurt only because you wouldn't freely give her
what she was asking of you.
Don't you see it?
If she didn't choose herself, and she had let you control everything
eventually nothing would have been left of the Basha you loved.
Is that what you really want, Poy?
The question is, do you still love her?
That never changed.
Your mom said you were here.
I'm leaving for Qatar.
My contract is for two years.
What about Tricia?
We're through.
when I hurt you before.
When we broke up,
I only thought of myself…
my feelings, what I wanted.
Sorry if I became selfish.
I couldn't understand that you needed to…
find the Basha who got lost when you loved me.
The Basha who still loves you.
You don't know how much I want…
for it to be us again…
for it to still be us.
But… every time I feel
how much I love you…
I can't help but feel the pain all over again.
And I'm sorry.
What should I do?
It's me, Bash.
I'm the one who needs time to think so I can forget all the pain.
So I can remember all that was beautiful about us.
So that the Popoy who got lost when we broke up can find his way back.
I want my heart to stop breaking, Bash.
So that if we ever get back together…
I can love you again with my whole heart…
without fear that we might get hurt again.
Bash.
Have I approved the layout? Where are the approved plans?
-Yes. -Let's double check.
Then, can you mark the reference elevation
for the floor finish?
-Here, ma'am. -Yes, here.
Let's start it now.
We're good with the 8th floor.
Can you check the other floors so see if the layout was followed?
Just report to me after the break.
Beautiful building.
You know the architect?
I want to tell her about the buildings I saw in Qatar.
When?
You think she's free?
You think she's free for dinner?
I've been gone two years.
I missed her.
There's so much I want to say.
I think she'd love to have dinner tonight,
tomorrow night,
Are you sure?
Because I'm in this for the long haul.
You're not leaving anymore?
Never again.
How long have you been together?
-Come here! -Popoy!
There's more here.
Those words had been dancing around my head all night.
I mean, it's Vegas lore, that phrase.
Just ask any of the old-time pit bosses, they'll know.
It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's who was first credited with the line.
He would shout it every time he dealt blackjack.
That was over 40 years ago, and the words still catch.
Winner, winner, chicken dinner. There it is!
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."
Yeah, try it.
I had heard it at least 14 times that night.
I couldn't lose.
First of all, what I was doing wasn't illegal.
There were certain institutions and people that frowned upon it,
but it's legal.
And not everyone can do it.
Just those with gifted minds.
I have a gifted mind.
That's what got me into all this mess.
I was counting cards and I was up over $640,000.
All right! I'm just gonna have to split those tens.
-Splitting tens. -Splitting tens again.
Well, that's all right. I've been winning and losing for years.
We used hand signals too.
Folded arms, the table's hot.
A touch to the eye, we need to talk.
And a hand running through perfect flowing hair meant only one thing.
Get out. Now.
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."
Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.

It's a free ride. And free rides don't come easy.
Absolutely.
We have 76 applicants this year, only one of whom will get the scholarship
and most of whom have résumés just as impressive as yours.
Right.
Professor Phillips?
Some kids grow up wanting to play for the Red Sox.
You know, some grow up wanting to be, I don't know, a fireman.
I grew up... Well, really, I just wanted to come here to Harvard Med.
And now that I've gotten accepted, it seems to only come down to the money.
Which I don't really have.
So, what I'm trying to say
is that I really, really need this scholarship.
Did you rehearse that?
Yeah. Like, 14 times in front of the mirror.
Unfortunately, desire doesn't figure into this much.
The Robinson is going to go to someone who
dazzles.
Somebody who just jumps off the page.
Oh, well, then, I'm also involved in a science competition.
We're building a robotic wheel
that can navigate itself using a proprietary GPS system.
Well, I'm designing the system. So...
Right.
Ben, last year, the Robinson went to Hyum Jae Wook,
a Korean immigrant who has only one leg.
Well, I have both my legs.
Well, have you considered cutting one of them off?
That was a joke.
Ben, it's all about the essay.
You need to really explain to us what makes you special.
What life experience separates you from all the rest.
Life experience.
What can you tell me, Ben,
that's going to dazzle me?
I'm so sorry I'm late.
-Where is your jacket? -Oh, I got it. I got it. It's right here.
This is no way for the new assistant manager to come to work.
Congratulations. How does $8 an hour sound?
Eight dollars?
Wow! Wow. That's great, Warren. Thank you. Thank you.
You slept with him, didn't you?
-Yes, I did. Yes, I did. -Yes, you did.
I'll sleep with him, too, and I'll get $8 an hour.
So Palmer finishes up his lecture, right? And I say to him,
"Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need at least 14 capacitance probes
"to get the kind of results that you're looking for," okay?
So then he says to me, "Miles, don't you think that's a little excessive?"
And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up in front of the entire class and I say,
"You can never have enough capacitance probes."
Oh, my God. What the hell is wrong with you?
Oh, nothing.
I hope nothing. You just got promoted, man. You should be happy.
I just gotta write this essay for the Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing.
And the reason that I have nothing is 'cause, well, I've done nothing.
-Oh, give me a break, Ben. -What?
You have everything.
You blow me out of the water, and I'm a cerebral stud. Is that nothing?
Yeah, well, it doesn't dazzle.
Hey. It dazzles me, mister.
You know, ever since I was 16, I crushed exams.
I took on extracurriculars. I showed up early.
I even sat up at the front and I stayed late.
Man, I gave up everything.
You know, I gave up fun. I gave up sex.
I don't think you gave up sex.
-Okay. Maybe not sex. -Yeah, you didn't give up sex.
All right, all right. Not sex, but...
It just annoys me that the one thing
that is stopping me from going to Harvard Med is money.
You know, tuition fees and living expenses alone cost over $300,000.
$300,000.
It's outrageous. It's astronomically high. I get that.
You know, I just thought there was more to life than just money.
Well, look at the bright side,
I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance.
Thank you.
-Happy birthday, honey. -Thanks, Mom.
Thank you, love. Kisses.
Make a wish.
-Make a wish. -Okay.
Bravo.
Congratulations, Benjamin.
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that? You see that?
It took me five minutes to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...
Where the next number is 21. Now you're slipping, Cam.
Cam, you owe another six bucks.
No, no. I didn't eat any of the Buffalo wings.
Oh, really? That's great. Well, we're not doing it that way.
We're just dividing equally. So let's say you pay.
-I got it, all right? -No, no.
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
It's your birthday. You're as broke-ass as I am.
I just wish now I had eaten some of those wings.
So, I nailed the specs on the 2.09 last night,
after 19 cups of coffee.
-Check it out. -You are kidding.
-What is this? -You're kidding!
This is good. Miles, this is good.
Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what we've been working for since we got here.
This is called destiny.
You know, there is the... Thank you.
There is the possibility that we might not actually win this thing.
Oh, yeah? Bite your tongue! Bite your damn tongue!
Look, guys,
we don't date, we don't travel, we don't have any money.
The only thing that we do have is the 2.09 Competition.
If we can't even win that, what's the point?
Hey, hey. Look at this!
No, no, no, no.
Yeah. We suck.
Your father would be so proud of you, Ben.
Yeah.
Do you remember anything about him?
Not really. Maybe when he shaved?
Yeah, I think I watched him shave.
So, what are your plans for the rest of the night?
I don't know. I'll probably just go back and work on that essay.
Ben, you're working too hard.
Between the job and school and the 2.09, you've had no time for just yourself.
You have to squeeze in a little time for fun, Ben.
You only turn 21 once. And it goes by very fast.
Okay. All right.
-Good night. -All right, good night.
-Don't come home before 3:00. -All right.
All right.
Now, who can explain Newton's method and how you use it?
You can use it to solve nonlinear equations.
That's impressive. That's really good. I mean, I'm very impressed by that,
especially since my class is called Nonlinear Equations.
All right, now somebody tell me something I don't already know.
Anyone?
Bueller. Anyone? Bueller.
Newton stole it.
-I'm sorry? -Newton stole it.
Joseph Raphson published this same method 50 years earlier.
And if the start value is too far removed from true zero, then it fails.
-I'm sorry, what's your name? -Ben. Ben Campbell.
Ben.
So Ben Campbell suggests that Joseph Raphson
was the original author of this method.
Well, if that's the case, then why didn't he get any credit?
Well, for one thing, Newton had a better publicist.
And for another, after 1700, we know very little about Raphson
other than the fact that he discovered the Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna.
All right, now, let's give Ben a chance for some extra credit, shall we?
We're gonna call this the game show host problem, all right?
Ben, suppose you're on a game show.
And you are given a chance to choose from three different doors, all right?
Now, behind one of the doors is a new car. Behind the other two, goats.
Which door would you choose, Ben?
Door number one?
Door number one. Ben chooses door number one.
All right, now, the game show host,
who, by the way, knows what's behind all the other doors,
decides to open another door. Let's say he chooses door number three.
Behind which sits a goat. Now...
Ben, game show host comes up to you.
He says, "Ben, do you want to stay with door number one
"or go with door number two?"
Now, is it in your interest to switch your choice?
-Yeah. -Well, wait.
Remember, the host knows where the car is
so how do you know he's not playing a trick on you?
Trying to use reverse psychology to get you to pick a goat?
Well, I wouldn't really care. I mean, my answer's based on statistics.
Based on variable change.
Variable change? But he just asked you a simple question.
Yeah, which changed everything.
Enlighten us.
Well, when I was originally asked to choose a door,
I had a 33.3% chance of choosing right.
But after he opens one of the doors and then re-offers me the choice,
it's now 66.7% if I choose to switch.
So, yeah, I'll take door number two, and thank you for that extra 33.3%.
Exactly.
People, remember,
if you don't know which door to open, always account for variable change.
Now, see, most people wouldn't take the switch
out of paranoia, fear, emotions.
But Mr. Campbell, he kept emotions aside
and let simple math get his ass into a brand-new car!
Which is better than that goat you've been driving around campus.
All right, everybody.
That's the end of the day. Thank you very much.
Your graded papers are down here at the end.
You can pick them up on your way out.
I am invincible.
Guys, Jill Taylor, 10 o'clock.
Man. That's brutal.
You know, you should just ask her out, man.
It's not like she's a rocket scientist or anything.
Oh, wait, she is.
Well, why don't you ask her?
Because I'm already dating someone.
Yeah, your right hand doesn't count, Miles.
It does the way I use it. It does the way I use it.
Hey, you know what? Maybe I don't even want to go out with her.
Yeah, that's funny.
You know, you say you want a life experience, right?
Well, I'd say getting down with that would definitely qualify.
Cam!
Boy genius.
You have to follow me now.
-Excuse me? -You have to follow me now.
Come on.
-Where are we going? -You'll see.
Our honored guest.
-How you doing, Ben? -I'm okay.
-You ever been in this room before? -Yeah.
Organic Chemistry in my freshman year.
-How'd you do? -Well, I got an A.
-Professor Rosa... -Micky, please.
Is there a problem with my paper?
Well, you found a more efficient method for finding true zero than Isaac Newton
and that, my friend, is not so much of a problem as it is a major ass-kicking.
Although Newton has been dead for over 250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight.
So, is this some kind of a math club?
Don't be rude, people.
-Kianna. -Fisher.
-Choi. -Jill.
-You ever studied blackjack? -No.
No, really? Well, it's really simple, actually.
You play against the dealer.
You're given two cards.
Face cards are worth 10 points.
The closest to 21 wins.
If you go over, you lose. If the dealer goes over, they lose.
It's the most popular card game in the world.
It's a game of memory.
Cards drawn are the past, ones to come are future.
And the best part, it's beatable.
Are you talking about counting cards?
No. I'm talking about getting very, very rich.
You count cards, right? All of you?
As a team, yes.
-When? -Weekends. And Christian holidays.
-Where? -Vegas, baby.
So, why are you telling me?
Well, let's just say a spot opened up on our roster.
How?
Jimmy got a job at Google.
-Jimmy got a job at Google? -Yeah, it's catchy, I know.
Well, if you're making so much money at this, then why did he take it?
Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler.
Yeah... This is crazy.
No, Ben. This is profitable.
Yeah, I can't do it. So, I'm sorry.
-Come on, Ben. It'll be fun. -Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun.
No, it's not that. It's...
I just got a promotion at my job, so it's kind of not a good time for me.
We pay better.
Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends.
Why not? MIT's on cruise control for you, you've already gotten into Harvard Med.
I mean, what do you have to worry about?
-How did you know that? -I like to take an interest in my students.
Well, I'm also really involved in the science competition.
You know, the 2.09 Competition?
Wait, no. I'm building a car that drives by itself.
Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing with my friends for over a year,
so it's kind of important.
Ben, let the car drive by itself.
Listen, you not only have a gifted mind, but you're also composed.
You don't give in to your emotions. You think logically.
Ben, you were born for this.
You'll have more fun than you've ever had in your entire life.
It's perfect.
Thank you. But I'm really not the right guy.
So I'm sorry.
Ben.
I hope this little conversation we just had will remain private.
-No, of... -No.
You're one of my favorite new students,
and I'd hate to lose you, if you know what I mean.
-I'm just not sure it's me. -It's boring.
It's boxy. It's blue. How is that not you?
So, how much is this thing gonna run me?
Oh, well, let's see, the belt's $49.95, minus 15%.
The jacket's $589.99.
The pants, $285.99, minus 10% for both.
Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale, but I can knock off 5% from the $69.99.
The shoes were just marked down from $155,
so you're looking at $1,042.68.
I'm pretty good with numbers.
-Yeah. -I guess so.
Yeah, so let me know when I can ring that up for you guys.
-Yes. Thank you. -Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
-Could you help me? -Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.
I'm looking for a tie.
Oh, well, we're having a 15% sale on the ties.
And if you want, I could probably get you an additional 10%
with my employee discount.
-This one's nice. -Yeah. Oh, yeah.
This one has actually been treated with our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection,
you know, to repel liquids and stains.
-Well, that's really functional. -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty functional.
Face me. Stay still.
Despite being tempted by the Nano-Tex repellant,
I'm actually not here for a tie, Ben.
I came to see you.
You did?
Blackjack's a great game.
No, look, it's easy to learn
and there's really not as much strategy to it as people think.
I grew up on it, actually.
-You grew up on it? -Yeah.
Every night after dinner, my father and I would play.
I knew basic strategy before I was, like, nine years old.
If I won, he'd take me out for ice cream.
And what if he won?
He'd still take me out for ice cream.
Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah, he's your dad.
Ben, you should feel the thrill
of winning more money than you can possibly imagine.
I think you should come to Vegas.
'Cause I'm guessing that you could probably use a break from this place.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
Okay. If you change your mind, you know where we meet.
Yeah.
You're welcome any time.
You know, I think the best thing about Vegas
is you can become anyone you want.
-What's the count? -Plus 9.
-No. -Plus 11.
No.
-Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago. -Don't call me "dude."
-Plus 9? -You're just following Jill.
People, please. We had a total of 76 cards that came out of the deck.
Twenty-three were high cards with a value of minus one.
Seventeen were neutral with no value at all,
and the rest were low cards with a value of plus one.
-How could you lose the count? -Plus 13.
The count. It's plus 13.
Yes.
Pull up a chair.
Stop.
-What is it? -Plus 12. Eggs.
Twelve eggs in a carton.
-Now what? -Plus 9.
Cats have nine lives.
Cat.
Sweet 16.
Every card had a value.
A high card, minus one. A low card, plus one.
The rest, zero.
Plus 13. Plus 8. Plus 9. Plus 12.
I was studying all day, every day.
But it wasn't physics, chemistry and engineering. I was back to simple math,
used in ways I could never have imagined.
The team had a system.
And to go unnoticed, we created a whole new language.
Words were numbers, and numbers were words.
-Plus 17. -Magazine.
-Plus 6. -Gun.
-Plus 15. -Paycheck.
Plus 12.
Is this chemistry review?
-Plus 14. -Ring.
-Plus 16. -Sweet.
Use it in a sentence.
Man, that sugar's sweet.
Because I knew the count, I knew which cards were left in the deck.
That's how I knew what to bet.
You're doing great.
Micky, I just want to let you know that I'm only doing this for medical school,
which is $300,000.
I mean, if I can get anything close to that, then I'm done.
Well, in the first place, Ben, it's not "if," it's "when."
And second of all, I get it. I completely understand.
-You do? -Yeah. It's a means to an end.
Look, they've got this new computer software that reads people's faces,
so who knows how long this gig's gonna last for any of us?
What if we get caught?
Our system keeps us under the radar, you'll see.
Anyway, counting cards isn't illegal.
-So, there's no danger in it at all? -No, Ben, it's safe. Very safe.
You think you can beat the system?
This is the system, beating you back.
You wanna count cards, you do it in Atlantic City.
-Get him up. -Come on, kid.
Count to five.
-Count to five! -What?
Count to five so I know you don't have brain damage, you can go home.
Start with one.
One, two, three, four, five.
Good. Now, stop counting.
Let's go.
You're crazy, everybody knows to split eights.
My grandmother splits eights.
Not against a 10. It's a sucker play.
Look, you're choosing to play two hands
against the highest up card a dealer can have, right?
Against a five or a six, it'd be fine.
Against a 10 or an ace, it's a sucker play.
Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right? Jill's right. All right?
Choi, why don't you explain to Ben how we do?
Oh, all right.
So, our team is divided into two kinds of players,
spotters and big players, right?
So if you think that this table is the casino floor,
then salt and pepper shakers are your spotters.
Spotters are just sitting at the various blackjack tables
and they're betting the table minimum. They never fluctuate their bet.
That's right. Spotters never raise the bet or play any kind of progressive system.
That's how we stay under the radar, and that's why we never get caught.
Exactly. Okay, they're just sitting at the table, betting the table min,
and they're keeping the count waiting for one of these decks to get hot.
Right. And then when one of the decks gets hot,
the spotter at that table signals in the big player.
This... Mustard. Give me the mustard, honey. Please.
Well, I'm always the mustard, so...
When I get the signal for the hot deck, I stumble over like some drunk rich kid,
or some zoned out dot-com millionaire, and I throw down big money.
So the big player bets big and still keeps the count.
When the deck cools, he cashes in.
It's not as easy as it sounds.
Oh, yeah, it's not, you know,
because if Grey Poupon over here ever loses the count,
it's up to his table's spotter to give him the signal to get out.
-And you know the signals, right? -Yeah.
Show us.
Okay, what's this?
-The deck's hot. -Right.
We need to talk.
The deck's cooling.
And get out. Get out now.
Good. I think he's gonna be ready for our little trial run tomorrow.
There's a trial run?
-Where? -You'll find out.
Hey.
-You Ben? -Yeah.
Follow me.
This way.
Go, go. You go.
No more bet. No more bet.
Come on, money.
Today, 14.
Whose side are you on?
Sixteen.
Thank you. Sorry, gentlemen.
So, Henry, did I tell you I read about this place in a magazine?
-You wanna put that money down? -Yeah. $300.
$300.
$300.
You bet, sir?
Thanks.
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner." All right.
Nice.
Can I get another drink, please?
Thank you.
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing? I haven't done anything! Get off me!
Get off, I haven't done anything!
Please. Please let go.
-What's the count? -Please don't hurt me.
-I said, what's the count? -Look, I haven't even done anything!
What's the count?
Plus 18.
Oh, you've gotta be kidding.
Congratulations, Ben.
Sorry, we had to make sure you'd keep the count under pressure.
Welcome to the team.
We didn't mean it.
It's okay, Campbell, I cried inside that bag.
Fisher and Jimmy have always been the big players.
I want you to take Jimmy's place.
I've never done this.
I know that and I understand.
But I don't trust the girls, and Choi is, well, Choi.
Look, I've been teaching for more than 14 years,
and I've never had a student as impressive as you.
Your brain is like a goddamn Pentium chip.
You're gonna do great. You know how I know that?
'Cause you remind me of myself 25 years ago.
You in?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm in. -Good. Good.
There's one more thing, Ben, and this is important.
We're counting cards, we're not gambling.
We're following a specific set of rules and playing a system.
Right.
I've seen how crazy it can get at those tables,
and sometimes, people lose control.
They give in to their emotions.
You will not.
You understand?
Yeah.
Get some rest.
-Some rest? -Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.
Tomorrow? I have a Quantitative Literacy paper due Tuesday.
-No, you don't. -I don't?
No, I spoke to Professor O'Reilly.
I told him you were helping me with a special assignment,
and he understood, so he gave you an A.
You see, Ben, amazing things can happen from the inside.
You'll get a call about details later.
So did the girls go on ahead, huh?
Oh, yeah. They got a lot more bags to check, you know?
Okay.
Well, wait for us by security 'cause Ben and I are gonna hit the head.
No, I'm good.
No, I really think you should go. It's a long flight.
-No, I'm okay. -We're going to the bathroom.
Honestly, I really don't have to go.
-I don't care what you have to do. -Look, I really don't have to...
Please just shut up.
Why are you looking over there? Look, I don't...
I don't care. Shut up. Get in here.
-What are you doing? -Let's go.
-Pull down your pants. -What?
Don't ask questions.
-Shove these in your underwear. -Why?
You want me to do it? 'Cause, I swear to God, I will.
-Why can't we leave it in the bag? -Because it shows up on the scanner.
And we're not about to have them confiscate $250,000.
$250,000?
-No. Why do I have to do it? -'Cause you're the donkey boy.
You really suck at not asking questions.
What's a donkey boy?
-Step forward, sir. -Thanks.
-In the basket, please. -There's a table when you get to the line.
Act casual, think casual, be casual.
Remove your keys, any metal objects. Laptops out, please.
Thank you.
If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag, please show them to us now.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
Your boarding pass.
Sir?
You forgot your bag.
Thanks.
Nice going, Campbell.
Hey, Ben. Basic strategy says you should hit that.
Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,
Mona, Miss Sommers, your new identities are on the bar.
So glad you could make it.
Vladimir Stupnitsky?
Yeah. Your dad's a diplomat with the Russian consulate.
You live in Washington, D.C.
Your hobbies are backgammon, chess and long walks on the beach.
-I don't like my name. -Why not?
"Sierra Sommers." Do I look like a Sierra?
Well, you have a lot of clever outfits. You'll figure it out.
Just pretend you don't speak English. Then you don't have to change your hair.
You know, I thought this was legal. Why do we have to use fake names?
Well, it is. We not only use fake names, we use disguises.
It's for the benefit of the dealers to make sure you're old enough to gamble
and it allows everyone to be different people in different casinos.
Hey! You steal the Bible, you go to hell. That's the way it works.
Like I'm not going already.
Yeah. All right. Now, listen.
Ben, this is for you. All the casinos have cameras in the ceiling.
They're called "eyes in the sky."
For their benefit, order a tonic water and lime and act a little drunk,
and at all times, you don't know each other.
Let me say that one more time, you do not know each other ever.
And what's our motto?
-Don't get caught counting. -Don't get caught counting.
Thank you very much.
How come you don't play?
Oh, I did. I played for a long time and I was the best. But I'm retired now.
Take my advice, Ben, it's always best to go out when you're on top.
Welcome to Vegas.
No more bets.
All right, here we go. Big money, now. Big money.
Let me tell you about blackjack, honey. You ever hear of basic strategy?
Oh, see, now that sounds really complicated.
-I'm Sierra Sommers from Charleston. -Pleasure.
Here to double my family's inheritance.
I don't know.
$10,000.
Changing $10,000.
Sweet. Too sweet.
Eight. The count's still plus 16.
Ten. That's minus one.
Count's plus 15.
Eight. Still plus 15.
Nine. Plus 15.
Five. The count's 16.
Eights. Split eights.
Can I split those?
-Sir, please don't touch the cards. -I'm sorry.
Jack. Count's plus 15.
Ten. Plus 14.
King. Nine. Plus 13.
Jack. Plus 12.
Nine. Still plus 12.
Blackjack.
Monkey! Monkey!
-So what's a monkey? -Face card.
All right, face card. Come on, monkey. Okay, monkey.
Monkey!
Monkey! Come on, give us a monkey!
Monkey! Come on, monkey, monkey, monkey! Monkey.
Monkey! Monkey!
All right, all right.
Oh, God.
I need to quit.
Could I color up, please?
Nice undies.
-What's this? -It's last night's take.
We split it five ways.
So, what do you think?
Yeah, it was fun.
-You were good. -Really?
Yeah. Came in quick off the count. You acted the part.
You weren't afraid to play big, and you got out when you were supposed to.
And you made more money than Fisher.
I was pretty nervous, actually.
You know, but after a while, it felt kind of easy.
Not for everyone.
Yeah, it's just simple math.
Good. We can do some serious damage with you.
Here's the thing I told Micky.
You know, I'm only really doing this just to pay for medical school.
You know, $300,000 and then I'm out.
That's what they all say.
No, really, I mean, I'm just doing this to pay for Harvard.
It's just a means to an end for me.
I believe you.
Good.
-Hello? -We have a team meeting in five minutes.
Team meeting.
Hello?
-Hey. -Hey.
Where's everybody else?
I don't know. Fisher was right behind us.
Oh, Fisher, you didn't sleep.
-I did. With Ida. -Ida?
She's a dancer. I pulled her out of Sapphire.
-And Ida's her dancer name? -Yeah. After her grandmother.
Where's Kianna?
Slots.
-Choi, where the hell you been? -Unattended maid cart, ninth floor.
I've been busy this morning.
All right, guys, let's get something clear.
This is not summer camp and I'm not your counselor.
This is real, world-class moneymaking business.
Kianna, slots are for losers.
Fisher, peelers are stealers.
Choi?
You made five grand last night, so would you stop stealing nine-cent pens
and everything you can get your hands on from the maid's cart? It's embarrassing.
But, Fisher, what the hell were you up to last night?
What?
Three separate occasions, the spotters let you know that the deck was cooling,
but you kept on anyway.
You either lost the count or you lost your head.
In either case, I don't wanna see it happen again.
Jill, nice disguise last night.
And Ben, good work. You came out of that chute like a pro. Keep it up.
Beginner's luck.
Hey, Fisher. Win like a man, lose like a man.
Micky, I didn't play into a cold deck three times.
You know what's worse than a loser?
Someone who won't admit he played it wrong.
Take it up with Ida.
Who's Ida?
-Who the hell is Ida? -Shut up.
-Who the hell is Ida? -Shut up.
There goes that paycheck.
-Money plays. -Money plays, up to the limit.
How's she doing?
Oh, that doesn't matter, man.
The way I see it, yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery.
It's all what you do in the moment, baby.
Just lost another property.
Who is it this time, Caesars or the Mirage? Caesars.
That was a 14-year account.
-They opted to go with the new software. -I know, Terry, I know.
Hey, Cole. We got absolutely murdered in pits four and five the last couple of nights.
Okay, Clark, I'll take a look at the tape.
By the way, you wanna lose the cigarette?
There's no smoking in here, you know that.
I appreciate it.
End of an era, my friend.
Ben. Time for school.
I seem to keep waking up to you.
Don't get used to it.
I'm glad you came over this morning.
-I have something I wanna give you. -Oh, yeah?
I want you to have this.
What's this?
That's a lot of money.
I've been saving for a long time. It's for medical school.
I know it won't pay the whole way, but it should help.
Ma, I can't take this.
This is your money. You worked hard for this.
For precisely this reason. I wanna help pay for med school, Dr. Campbell.
Well, you know what? You don't have to.
'Cause I got the Robinson Scholarship.
Yep, they're gonna pay the whole way.
Why didn't you tell me? Well, because I wanted it to be a surprise.
And actually, I just found out today.
I can't believe it! Oh, my God!
This is amazing. I am so proud of you.
-I knew the hard work would pay off. -Yeah, I know.
So, listen, you keep this, all right? It's yours.
What are you doing?
I'm just jumping up and down on my bed.
What? You never did that when you were a kid?
-No. Not really, never. -No.
Right.
All right.
So where were you this weekend? I tried calling you, like, 15 times.
Oh, yeah? I ended up having to go to New Hampshire
to help my cousin move.
You didn't bring your cell phone?
Your cell? Your phone? You didn't bring that?
No, I forgot it. I ended up leaving it here. So, you know.
Yeah, well, you missed a hell of a dorm party on Saturday.
Oh, yeah?
We almost had a girl there.
-Republik? -Yes.
Let's do it!
She is an eight.
-No way. She's a 7.649. -I was rounding up.
Hey, I thought we agreed we weren't gonna round up anymore.
That's right.
But if we win the 2.09, I'm asking her out.
Wait. Ben? Ben, you only owe eight bucks.
Hey. Can I get you a beer?
-Sure. -Yeah? Okay.
Excuse me. Can I get two Bud Lights, please?
Thanks.
-How you doing? -I'm okay.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Thank you.
Are those your friends over there?
No. No, I've never seen them before in my life.
Could you just excuse me for one second?
Guys, I'm serious. What are you doing? You're staring.
Yeah, we know.
Yeah, well, can you not?
I think it's gonna freak her out a bit, don't you think?
Yeah, I got a feeling we're a little more freaked out than she is right now.
So how do you know her?
Did you, like, take some self-help seminar or something?
What?
-Jedi mind trick, huh? -Jedi mind trick. Like that Luke.
-You will drink beer. -Right. Right, right.
There is a fortune on the table now, and it's all up to my dad.
It's getting ridiculous.
He actually needs to stop the table play, track down my uncle and take a loan.
-No, are you serious? -Yeah.
They let him, and he does.
He ends up with, like, two 19s and two 20s.
The dealer turns over a 17.
It's soft. He needs to take another card.
No. Don't say a four. Is it a four?
-It's a four, yeah. -It's a four. My God.
Not a great Christmas that year.
So, what does he think about what you do? Does he know?
Oh, no, he's long gone, Ben.
My dad's gone, too.
I'm sorry.
So, you know, when you came into the store to ask me to join the team,
was that because...
What?
Well, you know, was it because Micky asked you to?
Look, we've had three classes together.
You gave that presentation on combinatorial algorithms
that nobody understood.
You're the smartest person in every single one of those classes, Ben.
That is why you're on the team. And that's why I came into the store.
No, no, not so much...
-Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry. -No. It's fine.
-It's not a problem. -I don't know why I just did that.
-Don't apologize. -Are you sure?
Yes. Shit, this is my stop.
-You're getting off here? -Yeah, I've gotta get off.
But, really, don't worry about it.
I don't know, it's just 'cause we've been drinking, and...
It's just we're on a team, we work together.
-I get it. -Just don't feel bad about this.
Okay. Sure. Bye.
My world was flashing by at a million miles a minute.
I had saved over $100,000.
Only $200,000 to go.
But there was still one thing I couldn't get off my mind.
The moment we left campus,
the concept of vectors and formulas
were replaced with counting, shuffle tracking
knowing when to hit and knowing when to color out.
I was becoming a pro on all levels.
I made more money in one trip to Vegas
than I would have in 5 years, 9 months, 12 days and 6 hours at J. Press Menswear.
In Boston, I was just Ben Campbell.
But in Vegas, I could be anyone I wanted.
You know what I'm gonna do? You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna throw a half-mill down on the one hand. Come on. Hit me!
One night, I'd be the high-rolling heir to a pharmaceutical fortune.
Leon, could you make sure there's some champagne,
maybe some strawberries waiting in there for me.
I may not be alone.
The next, I'd be the hottest video game designer on the West Coast.
There it is.
Winner, winner, chicken dinner!
No, please, keep going. This video's priceless.
I'm not gonna lie.
It did get, well, a little confusing sometimes.
Operator, how can I help you?
Yeah, room service.
Excuse me? Honey, we don't do room service.
What do you mean, you don't do room service?
I mean, we don't do room service.
In Boston, we had a secret.
In Vegas, we had a life.
Micky said I was gonna have more fun than I could possibly imagine.
And he was right.
-Hey, Jamie. There you go. -Nice.
It was too good to be true.
There you go. All right, my night just got better. Thank you, Joe.
And it felt like it was never going to end.
Clark? I think I got something over here.
Take a look at this.
That guy? He's a kid.
He was on the tape from last week. Got a big roll and he's crushing your table.
Plus, he ordered a tonic and lime.
Tonic and lime. What does that mean?
It means he wants you to think he's drinking.
Okay. So is he counting or is he just getting lucky?
He's not running a progressive system.
He doubled on 10 when the deck was heavy, but he didn't on 11 when it got lighter.
-How can you tell if it's heavy or light? -I'm counting.
You...
Tell me something, Cole, if you can count that well,
why are you still consulting for us?
I've been asking myself the same thing.
Let's just say I like being on your side of the hustle.
Bring up a frame of that for me on the printer.
So, Terry, I heard you guys are losing a lot of work
to that biometric facial recognition software.
Just gives us a little bit more time to focus on you guys.
-That's impressive software. -I know.
Here he is.
I still think there're bigger fish to fry out there.
So do I.
Hey, Fisher.
He's mad at me and jealous of you.
But don't worry. Greatness evokes that reaction sometimes.
-Don't worry about it. I gotta go. -All right.
-Hey. -What's going on?
He just didn't like the subject I chose for my final paper.
-That's bullshit, Ben. -What?
I know when you're lying, I'm your best friend.
At least I thought I was.
Are you on drugs, Ben?
Because there's a group that meets at Simpson Hall on Saturdays.
No, no. Cam, I'm not on drugs, okay?
I'll go to the meeting if you need me to.
Why didn't you tell me you quit J. Press?
I don't know.
-Is it Jill Taylor? -No.
What about Harvard?
It'll find a way of working itself out.
-Look, I gotta go. I'll see you. -Ben.
I think the worst part of it was not being able to tell anyone.
But for the first time in my life, the world made itself easy for me.
Here you go, sir.
And I liked it.
That's for you.
We just made $210,000.
Yes.
Now, Ben, this is how we play!
And play we did.
Nothing cost too much.
Nothing was out of reach.
I guess you could say the casino host of fate
gave Ben Campbell a major upgrade.
Dorm rooms turned into high-roller suites.
Bicycles became stretch limos.
No, no!
And college bars that were always filled with frat dudes were upgraded to,
well, something more interesting.
-Hey, baby. Where you in from? -I'm from Boston.
-On a convention? -No, business, actually.
What line of work you in, mister?
I count things.
My name's Sierra.
Hi, Sierra. I'm Salvador Sanchez.
Would you like a private dance, Salvador?
Well, that all depends on how much it's gonna run me, Sierra.
$20 a song, 30-song minimum.
Sounds expensive.
-Good evening, Mr. Klein. -Hey, Frank. It's good to see you.
Jeffrey, you're taking my money.
You are so lucky you're cute.
'Cause if you weren't cute, I'd leave. You know that?
Jeffrey. My brother from another mother.
How you doing? You good?
I'm good, I'm good, Mr. K. What, are you back in town for business?
It's all business in this town, right? Well, with your money, I'm sure it always is.
Oh, damn, I forgot my ring.
Oh, please.
I don't wanna bet that. That's for keep.
$100,000 going out.
Thank you, Jeffrey.
-Cole. Your boy's back. -Yeah.
-That's him, right? -There he is.
And he brought a whole lot more money with him.
That is a hell of a suit, by the way.
-That is some aftershave he has going on. -Sir, could you not? Please.
This girl's only betting the table minimum. Why's she keep looking at him?
Terry, rewind the tape. I wanna see if she signals him to come to the table.
We don't use "tape" anymore, old school. It's digital now.
Never mind. Terry, rewind it.
Okay, okay.
She's playing the table minimum.
Now, in a second, she's gonna do something.
She's gonna raise her hand, scratch her head... There it is.
That's the signal. See? She gave him the signal.
He comes to the table. I'm telling you, they're working together.
Nice.
Show me a computer that can do that.
You look familiar.
I know you, don't I?
-I don't think so. -No?
Oh, sure, you look exactly like that guy in Rain Man.
Oh, yeah? Well, people say I look like Tom Cruise all the time.
Oh, yeah? No.
The other one, the... What's his... The retard.
I just love that scene in Vegas when the retard wins at blackjack.
You look just like that.
What I could never understand, though, is how someone so retarded,
could win so much.
Hey, Jeffrey, his brother from another mother,
how did that retard win so much?
-You know what, sir? I think that maybe... -Okay, get your hands off me.
Oh, I didn't mean it.
His luck'll run out eventually. It always does.
-Hey, Ben... -No, Ben, stop it!
-What the hell is the matter with you? -Hey, come on! Ben!
Oh, you think that's funny? You think that was funny? Shut up!
I understand, Ben. We don't need anymore...
This is not the time. Okay?
I want to thank you for confirming my choice in Ben.
Now go home.
-What? -You're off the team.
No.
-I was drunk, I was... -I don't care what you were.
I'm not leaving.
Yes, you are.
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
You've been the big man for a long time, but you just acted like a child.
So I want you to pick up the ticket and go home,
because if you don't, you know exactly what I'm capable of doing,
don't you?
All right, listen up.
Casino's gonna change out their chips, just like the MGM did after the Tyson fight.
That means we got less than 24 hours to cash in,
or we're gonna be sitting with 200 grand of worthless plastic.
-So we'll cash out. -It's too hot.
They're gonna be dissecting the eye in the sky footage of Fisher's little power play.
So let's do it right now before they can do that.
Are you deliberately slow?
What about them?
What about them?
They can cash in the chips. The casino's just gonna think they're tips.
-Cashing out. -Thank you.
-Thank you. -Thanks, sweetie.
-Thanks, hon. -Thank you, baby.
I love a parade, don't you?
You know, there's a word I don't throw around all that often,
"Genius."
Hey, Kianna. Let me hold your bag for a second.
Thanks, baby, here.
Oh, no problem. Anytime.
-Watch. Watch, watch. Ready? -Okay, I'm watching. That's beautiful.
Watch.
No, it's great, you just need to get your knee a little higher.
-Hi. -Hey.
So the Hard Rock comped me a suite.
That's cool, that's great.
You wanna see it?
All right, take care, Bobby. All right?
God, it's cold.
Hey, what time is it?
He's only 45 minutes late. Show a little patience.
Oh, look. Here he comes.
Guys, I'm sorry I'm late.
Hey, Ben.
You know, you could try returning a call once in a while.
Good of you to show up, man. It's not like we're cold or anything.
Yeah, funny.
-Hey, did you bring it? -Yeah, I got it. There it is.
And you're sure you didn't inlay the software on more space
than the parameters suggest?
No. It's just one-fifth of the free face.
Let's fire this mother up.
Beautiful.
Okay.
Okay.
What's happening?
-I don't understand. -It's the wrong size.
No. What?
-What the hell, Ben? This is an 8K. -Right.
Yeah, we needed 16K!
-I can't believe this. -I thought it was an 8K.
-No, you didn't. -Yeah, I did.
No, you didn't. You knew the entire time the discrete was 16K.
Damn it, Ben.
It's gonna take us two weeks to get a fresh 16K from the fabrication.
And another five days, minimum, to get it ready to press.
Miles, calm down, all right? It was an honest mistake.
What?
You know what? I think we're gonna have to go at this without you, man.
You're gonna what?
No, no. This is just as much mine as it is yours.
We've been working on this for over a year.
I know that. But your heart just isn't in this anymore.
Are you serious?
Fine.
Fine.
You know what? I don't even care. Honestly, I don't even care.
You know why?
'Cause no one in the real world gives a shit about the 2.09 Competition.
You know, it's just something that you build up in your head
to make yourselves feel important.
You guys are pathetic.
Thanks.
Welcome back, Mr. Youngman.
-Thanks, Joseph. It's good to see you. -Good to see you, too.
-Good evening, Mr. Zach. -Welcome back to the Red Rock.
Nice to see you.
Anything I can do for you, let me know.
Double down.
I guess you play big or you don't play at all.
Right?
Honey, there you are. Let's go. We don't wanna miss the show!
Honey, we're actually playing a game here.
Yeah.
Yeah, so you know what?
Why don't you run upstairs and wait for me there? Okay?
All right. Let's go.
Yeah, all right.
I've got the worst headache right now.
-Ten. -Come on, monkey.
-Fourteen. -Come on. Come on, monkey.
-Sixteen. -Monkey. Come on.
Twenty-one.
Pete, you're killing us.
I guess it's not my night.
Are you out of your mind?
I don't know what happened.
I messed up. I'm sorry.
Oh, you're sorry.
Well, see, now that's what I've been waiting to hear, Ben. As long as you're sorry.
I'm out 200 grand, but Ben's sorry! Everybody hear that? Ben's sorry!
So we can all go back to being friends and laughing over cocktails!
Come on, Micky. It can happen to anyone.
They get on a rush and they lose control.
You shut your mouth. This is business.
Hey, I let you down, all right? I get it.
Excuse me? You let me down? I don't care!
Let me make one thing clear to you, I am not your father!
You are not my friend. This is a business.
You are only as good to me as the money you make,
and, right now, it's not worth a hell of a lot!
You're gonna give me back everything you lost.
I can't do that! That money was for Harvard!
I have made you so much more than what I just lost!
It doesn't matter, Ben.
You had very clear instructions, and you didn't follow them.
You didn't do your job. You weren't counting, you were gambling!
Well, why aren't you out there, then, Micky?
I mean, we take all the risks. Seems to me like you don't do shit.
This isn't about me,
you arrogant little infant.
You can all find your own way back to Boston.
And, Ben, you're gonna pay me that money, every penny, one way or the other.
And you damn well know it.
I need a drink.
Anybody else?
Yeah, well, we don't need him.
-Yeah, okay, Ben. -No, I'm serious.
Why do we need him? We have our own money now.
You know, his cut was 50%, and he doesn't even play!
Why do we need him?
Hey, you know what I think?
I think we play out the weekend, and I think we do this without him.
No. No, I don't think that's a good idea.
I think we should go back to Boston and figure this out.
Yeah, well, why don't we let the team decide?
I'm with Jill. This is Micky's thing. Micky brought us together.
And then he drove us apart.
I mean, you saw how he played Fisher against me.
Choi, what do you say, man? You wanna make some money?
-Kind of. -Really?
We need 100 grand just to play. You're talking about risking our own money.
All I'm saying is that we try it. You know?
If we make the investment, then we take all of the winnings.
All of it.
Okay.
Yeah.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Choi?
I'm in.
Now I need a drink.
-What are you doing? -What?
What are you doing?
Well, we're printing money.
What, you think just 'cause Micky left that we're gonna stop?
No, I could do this. I can lead this team.
You know, I'm not the same guy I was back in Boston.
-Exactly. -Yeah, exactly.
You know, isn't this exactly who you wanted me to be
when you first came into the store to buy a tie?
What happened to "$300,000 and I'm out"?
What happened to "a means to an end"?
-How much do you have? -What?
-How much do you have? -I got enough.
Come on, Ben. How much do you have saved back in Boston?
I've got 315 grand, all right?
Then why are you still here?
Because I wanna still be here. I like being here.
So does everybody else.
So come on, Jill. Are you in?
You are the big player, Ben.
Yes, I am.
Yeah, can I get a drink?
Rose, I wanna thank you.
You have been most accommodating.
All right, that's for you.
Okay, take care. Hey, good luck.
Hey, how we doing here, people?
Yeah, I'm gonna put you on hold while I track him down.
Just got an interesting call.
There's nobody left to fire us. Planet Hollywood is our last client.
I don't know about that.
This is Cole.
Queen of diamonds. Your lady luck tonight.
You're doing good.
You're a real winner.
Sometimes. Just like everybody else.
Now, why don't I believe that?
Maybe you're just smarter than everybody else, huh?
Yeah, I bet it's been that way your entire life.
Except it just recently started paying dividends, am I right?
I'd split them.
Deck's heavy as hell and since I've been here, the true count's at plus 7.
Kianna. I think we have a serious problem over there.
-Walk now! -Oh, shit. Oh, shit!
Let's go. I'm out. Thank you. Let's go, Jill. Let's go.
I think we need to call security or something.
Yeah, I don't think they're gonna help. Let's go! Come on.
Let's take a walk, huh?
Come on, kid. See if we can't get you that chicken dinner.
It's called Biometrics.
Biometrics. It's sort of like a fingerprint of your face.
See, when the player sits down at the table, the software, it reads this...
Biometric profile.
...biometric profile of your face,
cross-references it with a database of counters.
Software'll probably put you and me out of business, but it still can't do this.
All right.
You understand all this. You go to MIT.
Smart boy.
My name is Cole Williams.
And if I ever see you in this town again,
I will break your cheek bone with a small hammer,
and then I will kill you.
Please. Please just take the money.
You can take it.
Tell me,
how's good old Professor Rosa doing, huh?
Oh, yeah. Me and Micky, we go way back.
I spent years, chased him all over this town.
Giving him beat downs left and right, only to find him at the tables a week later.
He was very persistent.
And then, one September night,
when I was in Barstow at my father's funeral,
my casino was taken for seven figures.
Can you imagine that?
The most ever taken by a single counter in one night.
'Course I was, naturally, unceremoniously fired.
Funny thing, though.
I never saw Micky Rosa after that.
Never.
Cauchy was the first to make a rigorous study
of the conditions for convergence of an infinite series.
And was concerned with developing
the basic theorems of the calculus as rigorously as possible.
Any questions?
No? All right, moving on.
Isn't it true Cauchy stole from his students?
Yes, I heard that. What's your theory on that?
They say he used his students for their brilliance,
then discredited them and stole their equations,
stole their hard work.
Well, that wouldn't be the first time a teacher was accused of that.
I think what he's referring to is Vladimir Stupnitsky, yes?
He was a student of Cauchy's who accused Cauchy
of stealing his four-volume text on this analysis
and publishing it under a pseudonym.
Of course, nobody knows what really went down there.
They never did prove it, and without the proof, it's a little like it never happened.
And, you know, it's a real shame,
because if Stupnitsky had just realized that he shouldn't have crossed Cauchy,
this was the dispute,
if he'd been able to get beyond some of the personal mistakes that were made,
I have no doubt that Cauchy would have worked with him again,
and they could have done great things together.
But, as history shows us, some students never learn.
You should get that eye looked at.
You okay?
Everything's gone.
-What? -Micky's taken everything.
He's taken the money, taken away Harvard Med, even MIT.
-What are you talking about? -Micky, he's taken everything.
I gotta find a way to get it back.
Are you insane?
You just got the shit kicked out of you and you won't let this go!
Look, what am I supposed to do, Jill? I've just lost everything!
Look, please...
I don't want to lose you, too.
Ben, you were dragged away in Vegas.
I haven't heard from you. I had no idea where you were.
I know.
I know.
You know, I'm so sorry that I hurt you.
I'm sorry.
In Vegas, I don't know what happened. That wasn't me.
Look, you know me.
You know what I'm like.
You know me.
I just... I need you to trust me.
And the winner of this year's 2.09
for excellence in the field of robotics goes to the team of Conolly and Kazazi!
That's it. That's the story.
Jill Taylor. Really?
-Yeah. Yeah, really. -Wow.
Yeah, it doesn't feel like "wow," Miles. I really screwed up.
Yeah, you did. But you had a life experience.
I can't believe how I treated you, Miles.
You know, you're my best friend, and I really let you down.
I really let you down. I'm sorry.
And I'm happy for you, you know? Winning the 2.09? That's great.
-Jill Taylor. Really? -Yeah.
So let me get this straight.
Money, girls,
high-roller suites, clubs, Vegas.
Yeah, I think I probably would have blown off the 2.09 Competition, too.
So we cool?
Yeah, we're cool.
But you better believe that you're gonna make this up to me, big time.
All right.
So, what are you gonna do now?
What do you want, Ben? This is an alumni dinner.
You need a diploma to come to one of these.
Wait. Stupnitsky wants back in.
What?
Look, I've had some time to think about what you said.
I want back in.
-Why now? -Because I have nothing else.
All right, look, Ben. I'm not gonna lie to you. You're good, you're very, very good.
But you did exactly what I told you not to. You got emotional and then you got stupid.
Now you tell me why in the world I'd ever get back in business with you.
Look, I know I should never have disrespected you, all right? I know that.
With this facial recognition software,
our window of opportunity is closing in on us.
Now, I need this, Micky. I really, really need this.
Well, the take would have to be really, really good to get me even vaguely interested.
Well, you know, that's why I was thinking maybe you should be the other big player.
You know, two big players playing big?
Hey, slow down, I haven't played in a long time, Ben.
But Fisher's out.
No one else on the team can be the big player, can they?
And if we do well, if we do really well,
then you get your grades back, get to Harvard Med,
and I might even get that sabbatical.
Well, amazing things can be done from the inside, right?
Just went back to the head of the class.
I gotta go be social.
All right, now listen. It's different out there this time.
The stakes are high and it's more dangerous.
But the return is gonna be the biggest.
Now they know our faces, so we're gonna wear disguises.
And we can't mess around.
I'm glad you're back with us, Micky.
Well, I couldn't let you guys come back to this town
and not prove to Ben that I can do more than just teach.
But as we've all said, this game is about the past and the future,
and tonight we forget about the past.
We just focus on the future.
Right. This is our last time.
Now, we all know the drill if things get ugly. We meet at the Fox Strip Club.
Nobody leaves this town alone.
Let's go make a killing.
All right.
Let's see what we can do with this.
Seems like I'm having one of those days, you know what I mean, Jim?
I'm bringing all the luck today. I'm just bringing it all.
Anyone who's in any kind of contact with me is getting so much luck today.
Winner, winner, chicken dinner! There it is.
Thank you. God, I love this town. I love this game.
And, Jim, I might even love you.
Hey, you mind if I sit down?
What's your name?
Shane? I'm about to change your luck. It's gonna become mine.
There you go, give me it all.
There you go.
Thank you. Thank you.
Such a shame, Shane!
Okay, I'm supposed to double, right?
-Is this your first time, darling? -I've been winning and losing for hours.
Well, that's all right. I've been winning and losing for years.
What the hell kind of streak are you on, boy?
This never happens, this never happens.
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.
-Splitting tens. -Splitting tens!
-Split tens! -Again!
-Thank you, ma'am. -Give me the chips, Blanca.
Give me the chips! Come on, give me the chips, Blanca.
Come on, just give me the chips!
-My bus has to leave right away. -I gotta walk my dog.
-I'm sorry we're making such a mess. -Go, go, go, go, go.
Nice to see you. Have a good night, darling.
This way!
Go.
This way!
Come on, Jill. Come on!
Go that way. Throw me the chips. Come on, we gotta separate.
Give me the chips, I'll meet you at Fox's.
Go, go, go, go!
Come on, come on.
Move, move, move!
Come on.
Go, go, this way.
All right, let's go.
Go, go, go, go! Airport!
I never saw Micky Rosa after that.
Oh, God.
But I think I wanna see him now.
And I want you to make that happen.
I don't work for Micky anymore.
Come on, kid.
Your picture's all over the database. Your Vegas gig is done.
But I will give you one night.
And I can guarantee that you won't be bothered.
You'll make a killing, and you'll keep it all.
Listen.
My name's Cole.
Cole Williams.
You just bring me Micky Rosa, kid.
I'll take care of the rest.
Son of a bitch.
Who the hell are you?
Ben. Good job.
You'll be glad to know I'm gonna have a talk with your professor, and that MIT thing?
It's gonna work out for you.
So that's it?
-That's it. -All right.
Oh, Dr. Campbell?
They don't have pensions in my line of work.
And the software does what it's supposed to do.
And I've been chasing Micky Rosa around here for too damn long.
I'm looking at some retirement.
Leave the bag.
No. No, no, no, no.
I need this money. You have no idea what I went through to get this money.
I know, kid, but you're gonna figure out how to get everything you want in this life,
'cause you're smart.
So, you're gonna leave the bag.
Ben, give him the bag. Give him the bag. It doesn't matter. Give him the bag.
I knew you were smart.
I had a 1590 on my SAT.
I got a 44 on my MCATs.
And I have a 4.0 GPA from MIT.
I thought I had my life mapped out.
But then I remembered
what my Nonlinear Equations professor once told me,
"Always account for variable change."
Hello, Micky.
Look, I got money in Boston. A hundred grand.
I'll give it to you. Just let me walk away. I'll walk away.
I don't want your money, Micky. I don't need it.
But I know someone who might be interested.
He's good with numbers, too. He works for the IRS.
I let down my good friends.
But as it turns out, they weren't too bad at simple math either.
I scored the prettiest girl in school.
I got beaten down by an old-school Vegas thug
who was having trouble accepting his retirement.
But I worked out a deal with him that got him a nice pension.
And I lied to my mother.
But I confessed the lie, and, well, she still loved me.
So my senior year of college, I joined this team.
And I learned this new skill.
I went to Vegas 17 times to use it.
I made hundreds of thousands of dollars counting cards.
And then I had it all stolen from me.
Twice.
Shit!
-(humming) -Molly? Molly?
Molly?! Hey, I was listening to that.
Earth calling sisterling.
Have you forgotten today's the day Rosemary moves in?
Like you'd let me forget?
Please tell me you're not gonna do anything crazy.
Look, you know I love you Mollster, but are some things you're just way too young to understand.
but are some things you're just way too young to understand.
I know what I'm doing, though, okay?
-Trust me. -Poppy!
All right, guys, let's give my dad's girlfriend
the perfect Malibu welcome.
Everyone, help yourself! (all cheer)
You can keep it or you can throw it away.
You can keep that. (chattering)
Oh, Poppy, you've really done it this time.
Hey, girls, watch this.
Where did she go? -Is she okay? -Is she still down there?
-She's still under. -There might be sharks.
-She's still under. -There might be sharks. Welcome to Malibu, biatch!
Get up here right now! Get up here!
Please go home. Home, home.
(chattering)
Go on, out. Out.
Out, out, out. Let's go. Come on, out. Out, out.
That is the final straw, Poppy! You are going to England. -Let's go. -Yawn!
-Let's go. -Yawn! The boarding school threat again!
I don't even recognize you anymore.
All this is gonna stop right now!
So, what? Big deal!
You can just replace me with a newer, trashier version,
like you did with Mom.
You are going to boarding school in England, and that's final.
What, you think just because Mom went to boarding school in England,
it's gonna magically straighten me out?
Do you even remember Mom?
Hi, Molly.
I think you might've pushed him too far this time.
I know.
But England's so far away.
Well, at least they speak American there, right?
But who's gonna cut the crusts of my sandwiches?
You're gonna be fine, Mol.
I promise.
Oh, in England, it rains 200 days out of the year.
You will definitely get S.A.D.
She is sad.
Seasonal Affected Disorder. Depression due to lack of sunlight,
Depression due to lack of sunlight,
resulting in acne and weight gain.
What? What? I saw it on Dr. 90210.
What? I saw it on Dr. 90210. (groaning)
(gasps) Not those shoes.
They don't do rain.
Just take them.
Hey, you promise we'll talk every day? Swear on your life?
Dude, who loves ya? Everything's gonna suck without you.
Everything's gonna suck without you.
Oh, Ruby, you're my best friend. I'm gonna miss you so much.
I know, let's check out their website. (door closes)
(both) Oh, my God!
"Abbey Mount School is an independent boarding school
"for girls age 11 to 17?
Founded in 1797!
The school is one of England's top institutions for young ladies?"
-It's all brick! -Ew.
Please tell me that's not in the countryside.
Excuse me.
Hello, how are you?
All right, Kate. Yes?
Mr. Moore, I'm Mrs. Kingsley.
Oh, please call me Gerry. Thank you, I am so grateful
I'm happy we could help out.
She's going through rather a difficult stage.
Just leave it to me, Mr. Moore.
I have a double first in difficult.
-Hello. -Hi.
-Good holiday? -Yeah.
Good.
Hello, Poppy, welcome to Abbey Mount.
I'm Mrs. Kingsley, your headmistress.
Look, I understand you're just-- Uh-uh uh-uh.
Lesson number one, Poppy.
To me, negotiation is like a nightclub...
not something I tend to enter into.
Now, come along.
-Hello. -Hi.
-Who's she? -Is she new?
-Wow. -Look at those shoes.
Poppy, this is Kate.
She'll be your big sister at Abbey Mount.
You'll soon settle in.
-Hi, how do you do? -I already have a sister.
It's just school lingo.
I'll be your friend, a helping hand, that's all.
Okay, but, um, I choose my friends.
And FYI, you don't make the cut.
I'm sure that comment would sting a lot more
if I knew what "FYI" meant.
But, for the moment, let's just pretend
it's had the desired effect, shall we?
Saddle up, girls, we've got ourselves a bronco.
Mrs. Kingsley, a gift.
One for you and one for Freddie.
Oh, thank you. I shot them myself.
Oh, I don't doubt that you did.
Well, perhaps you'd like to keep hold of them while I welcome back the first years.
Nice thought, though.
Harriet. Head girl.
You shake the hand of the head girl out of respect.
When the head girl has earned my respect,
then I'll shake her hand, biatch.
-I'm sorry. -Apology accepted.
Stunningly horridious ego
desperately seeks a good bashing.
Can we oblige?
Me thinks so.
(together) We think so, too.
I'll call you tomorrow morning as soon as I'm back in L.A.
I hope your flight gets seriously delayed. (chuckles)
And I hope your bags end up in Kazakhstan.
I'll come back for you at the end of the semester, all right?
Sweetheart,
you know I love you.
Bye.
I have to find this CD to play for you guys. ♪ I gave a slap ♪
♪ I gave a slap ♪ ♪ You smashed a plate over my head ♪
♪ Then I set fire to our bed ♪
♪ Oh ♪
♪ My black eye casts no shadow ♪
♪ Your red eye sees no blame ♪
Excuse me.
Huh?
Hi, um, I've been assigned this room.
You need to leave. (all laughing)
Oh... wow, communal.
Well, it's bed number five or the corridor.
Your choice, mate.
Move your stinking socks, Drippy. (girls continue chattering)
You lock away your chocolate?
Key information,
if it's the Wagon Wheel versus the Rolex,
the Wagon Wheel is going to trounce it every time.
What's a Wagon Wheel?
Jesu Christi, you have not lived.
That's carbs and sugar.
What a revelation. I had no idea. Mm.
What the bleep is that? None of your bleeping business.
It's an iPhone.
Good luck getting a signal.
We only have two hot spots that work 'round here.
Maybe you should try entering the 21st Century, Buck Rogers.
This place is medieval.
It's imperative that I make my phone calls.
It's pointless anyway.
Only allowed mobiles on weekends.
How am I supposed to call my therapist.
She's joking, right?
Oh, sweetheart, this is not Beverly Hills 90210.
Just put it away before Matron catches you.
Where's your trunk.
It hasn't been delivered yet.
No...
No! Ew.
No, no, no.
Not the new season Gucci.
The Choos! No!
This is all only hand-washable. This is ridiculous. Uh, why?
Uh, why? What? I might get thirsty.
You know, in the U.K., we have this amazing thing-- It's called a tap.
Oh.
Welcome back, girls.
Oh, good, staff. How quickly can you get all this stuff cleaned?
How quickly can you get all this stuff cleaned?
-Is she... -Mm-hmm. American. Oh, yes.
We had one of those in 1997. Not good.
Oh. Accustom her to my rules, and she should be in the correct uniform for a start.
Mobile phones, please, girls.
Thank you, Kiki.
Thank you, Josie. Thank you, Kate.
Thank you, Josie. Thank you, Kate. Whoa! Hands off, mama!
I said hands off!
I am Scottish, not remedial.
Good, then you understand.
Line-dry, press. No starch, and no creases.
How dare you. No mufti for a week?
Fine. Mufti might be your thing, lady, but it sure ain't mine.
She means no home clothes for a week. Like I give a shit.
-Huh? -I'll be gone by then. Language!
Two Sundays detention for the whole dorm. (all groan)
I'll deal with this. -Look, hey, hey. -Huh?
Here's a Ben Franklin.
Why don't you go out and buy yourself-Well, anything.
Whatever you get will be a serious improvement.
Three Sundays for everyone.
Three Sundays for everyone. (all moan)
Thanks a lot for that, you utter moron.
-What, are you mental? -What?
-What, are you mental? -What? She was a grade one A-hole with a severe attitudinal problem.
The bell's gonna go in a minute. Just put your uniform on. (scoffs)
(all) Now!
You will never get away with that uniform for start,
and FYI, no drinking, no smoking, no alcohol, no fireworks, no dangerous weapons,
no fireworks, no dangerous weapons, no illegal drugs.
If you have a problem with someone, no random bitching.
Structure your point.
No Web-surfing, no bullying.
So, if you behave like an asshole, we all suffer.
So do not get us in your shit, or we will break you.
Oh, I'm scared.
-Hi, Kate! -Hello.
What are you, like, prom queen or something?
Kate's got a terrible affliction.
You're actually lucky that you don't have it. It's called "popularity".
Hey, get up.
Wait for Mrs. Kingsley and the prefects.
Screw them.
That is physical abuse! I'm calling my lawyer!
With what?
Well, hello, Freddie.
How kind of you to grace us with your gorgeous presence.
And cue Harriet in three, two, one.
Subject's moved in on target. And we have contact.
And we have contact.
(both) Walk, Annabelle.
I love that Freddie's always here at the beginning of term. It's such a perfect welcome back.
It's such a perfect welcome back. So, who is Freddie?
So, who is Freddie? Mrs. Kingley's son.
Devastating heartthrob. Won't look at any of us since he got caught
playing doctors and nurses with a girl in the third grade when he was 11.
Massive hoo-hah.
They're not together now, though.
Because of her massive hoo-hah? (all laughing)
No. Fraternizing is forbidden.
Here you go.
I can't eat this. Anorexia or bulimia.
Because if it's bulimia, I'd rather you didn't eat other people's birthday cake on their birthdays.
It's such a waste.
Actually, I'm a pescetarian Monday through Wednesday,
fruitarian Thursday through Sunday,
and vegetarian always. Oh.
(all) For what we're about to receive... Nam ring-eye kie.
(all) Amen.
Namaste.
Get out of my way. Hey, watch the 'shmere, girlfriend.
Hey, watch the 'shmere, girlfriend.
Two hundred goats died for this.
We meet again. How sublime. Learn the rules.
When it comes to right-of-way, there is a hierarchy.
Teachers, prefects, scholars,
dogs, vermin, Americans.
Kate, see to it she falls in line.
What is this place, Hogwarts?
Bedtime, girls.
Night.
The correct school uniform.
Wear it. Bed.
Poppy Moore, bed, now!
Right. Translation today, everyone.
So, uh, PDF, pretty damn straightforward.
Uh, ergo,  uh, which means?
Anyone? Ergo.
Oh, Mr. Nellist? Yes, Drippy?
Uh, leave.
Luddite.
No, it means "therefore", Drippy.
Therefore, you'll probably finish early, which means that, uh, you'll have lots of time
which means that, uh, you'll have lots of time
to ask me questions about my trip to Champagne with my girlfriend.
Who's now suddenly my-my ex-girlfriend.
Though she was my girlfriend at the time.
(whispers) Embarrassing.
Put your headphones on.
Hi, guys. You don't happen to have any eyebrow tint, do you?
(all) No.
You guys have any eyebrow tint?
Apparently, California girls wax their bums. What? Why?
What? Why? To look Brazilian.
To look Brazilian. Makes it look more attractive.
If you say so.
Do you think she's done it?
Do you think she's done it? Hundred percent.
She's definitely done the missionary
and almost certainly the Lebanese fulcrum.
I can tell.
How?
From the angle of her hips.
Can I help you? Is there a problem?
How many boys have you shagged?
Well, there was Brandon, Eight-pack. Uh, Chase, Jock.
Tyler, Bajillionaire. Derek...
He was Kelly Slater's cousin... and, um, oh, Jack.
He was Kelly Slater's cousin... and, um, oh, Jack. He was all-around sick.
Christ.
I mean, sick body, sick mind.
(gasps) Shit! Kate!
Sorry, Drip, it looked lighter on the box. Oh!
That is butters!
Better not stop me pulling at the social.
Honey, eyebrows are the least of your worries.
Lights out, girls. Everyone into bed.
-Night, Matron. -Night.
Hey, switch that off.
No wireless. Should've known.
Internet is only allowed in the computer room.
Whoa! We are not allowed out of bed after lights out. -Oh, look. -Hey!
-Oh, look. -Hey! -They're not out. -What are you doing?
-They're not out. -What are you doing? Get back into bed!
"Dear Ruby, oh, my God.
Two weeks in this place, and I'm going out of my mind.
These girls are all ugly losers,
who think a mani-pedi is some kind of Latin greeting."
Come on! Fire practice! Shit!
Shit! Remove yourselves to the quad immediately!
Come on, you know the drill, for goodness sakes.
Come on, stop being so slovenly. Hurry up, Kiki.
Come on, girls, hurry up!
What if it was a real fire?
You'd all be burned to a crisp!
(water splashes) Hey, who's there?
Uh, Poppy.
Last name. Moore. Poppy Moore, sir.
Moore. Poppy Moore, sir.
Well, Moore, Poppy Moore, this is a fire practice.
Sorry. I'm-I'm new here.
Yes, that's obvious.
But weren't you listening in physics class?
Fire tends to be hot and the point is to avoid it.
Okay. Where do I go?
Out the door, turn left, and down the stairs.
Run towards the bright orange, uh, flickery thing, right? Oh, and, uh, try not to get caught.
Oh, and, uh, try not to get caught.
Excellent point, sir.
Lovely, Harriet.
Crack on, team! Lovely stick work, Harriet. (shoes squeaking)
Mr. Nellist.
Finito. Well, super, super effort.
We may not win the championship,
but we'll win a lot of friends, yeah?
So bloody English.
Ha ha ah! Really? And you could do better?
Laugh it up.
But I could whip all of your asses blindfolded.
This I'd love to see.
Oh, it's on like Donkey Kong. Do your worst, horse face. (hisses)
Foul! Body check! Body check!
Aah! -Please! -(whistle blows)
Totally illegal.
Shouldn't you guys be in bikinis for that?
Hi, Fredster. Dig the car. (engine revs)
Hello, Moore. Poppy Moore.
Hi. Uh... hey!
Bye.
Oh, do you love Fredster? Do you wanna kiss Fredster on the lips?
Don't be so immature.
Don't try and hide it, honey.
We've got ourselves a SULA.
Sweaty Upper Lip Alert.
How on earth did Freddie know her name?! You may depart.
You may depart.
But, um, I still have to turn down your bed.
-Get out! -(sobs) Oh!
I don't understand.
Freddie's got a crush on me. Why was he looking at her?
He was looking at her so he didn't come across as looking at you.
He needs to be careful. He can't get caught.
Yeah, and if he looked at you too much, he wouldn't be able to control himself.
Like, when I have to look sad, I think about...
...horses being slaughtered.
So, to Freddie, Poppy's the equivalent
So, to Freddie, Poppy's the equivalent to a slaughtered horse.
You're probably right.
But we're going to have to do something about little Miss U.S.A.
She needs a lesson in exactly who's boss, me thinks.
(both) We think so, too.
I didn't start it, it wasn't my fault.
-Go out and close the door. -But you asked to see me!
Yes. Well, you have to knock before you enter.
I can't believe it. This is all horse face's fault. (knocking)
Who is it?
-Jesus Christ. -Oh, dear.
-Jesus Christ. -Oh, dear. We were led to believe you had a beard and sandals.
Now we'll have to change that stained glass window in the school chapel.
Look, I didn't start it, it wasn't my fault,
and if this were America, I would sue.
That girl is a grade one A-hole,
with severe attitudinal problems.
I know perfectly well what happened, Poppy.
Then why isn't Harriet here, too.
Because, unsurprisingly, it's you I want to talk to.
Look, I know it's very difficult
being the only new girl in your year.
You mean the only normal girl.
What do you like to read, Poppy?
"OK Magazine," "People," "US Weekly."
Well, might you be able to tackle such a thing as a book?
I prefer movies.
Well, my personal library seems to be missing
the book version of "Freaky Friday." (scoffs)
So perhaps you might try this.
Oh, my uncle's producing the film version.
"Alice in Wonderland" was originally a book.
You might surprise yourself and actually enjoy it.
This is my punishment? (scoffs)
This school is so weird.
What do you want to get out of this school, Poppy?
To get "out" of this school.
You know, this school has produced absolutely nobody of note.
Our leading light was the girl who was Princess Diana's foot doctor.
So, if your aim is to make pages of "Us Weekly",
then isn't the place for you.
What we do produce is smart, independent, free-thinking, good-hearted girls,
good-hearted girls,
who remain friends for life.
The kind of girl that, behind all your wisecracks, I know you are.
Run along now, I must get on.
My in-tray is piling up.
Not brown enough. More coffee.
Ugh. More elbow grease.
You're aging these clothes, not stirring your tea.
I need complete authenticity.
Charlotte heard Freddie say
I looked exactly like Keira Knightly.
Right. That's done. Empty the water.
Not that way, fool.
You'll spill it. Out the window.
-Out the window? -Just get on with it.
Are you sure?
-(gasps) -So sorry.
Just can't trust the help these days.
Do you have a pass to be out during lessons?
Oh, yeah, I do. It's-it's right here!
Well, don't walk on the grass!
For the tenth time, you need to make your bed.
Jesus, what's so bloody hard?
Pick up, put down. It's not rocket science.
Sit down, I'll do that.
Thanks.
You're freezing, you need a jumper.
Whatever that is, I don't think I have one.
I don't think I have anything thicker than prosciutto.
Thanks.
I didn't really come prepared. Didn't figure I'd be here this long.
Didn't figure I'd be here this long.
Nothing worse than the only message you get
all day being from the phone company.
But Matron took all the phones. No. She took all your phones.
No. She took all your phones.
She took our decoys.
She has no idea that none of them work.
We keep our real phones hidden.
Here.
Call your parents, call your therapist. Knock yourself out.
But why would you do this for me?
I mean, you think I'm a total asshole.
No. You behave like an asshole.
There's a difference.
Look, I know that I'm not some Malibu therapist,
but I can guess that you're feeling scared
and a little bit homesick.
Which, in my experience,
doesn't actually make you a bad person. Just a normal one.
Sweet photo.
Is it your mum?
Is she gonna come out and visit?
She died in a car accident when I was 11.
Poppy, I'm so sorry.
I know you're not some Malibu therapist, but, um...
Listen, are you serious about getting out of here?
Listen, are you serious about getting out of here? Yeah.
Yeah. Then you're gonna have to get yourself expelled.
Okay.
"Anybody disporting themselves in an improper manner will be proposed for expulsion before the Honor Court."
will be proposed for expulsion before the Honor Court."
Wait, Honor Court?
It's like a trial, in front of the whole school, by your peers, your teachers, the head girl,
and Mrs. Kingsley.
But, I'm telling you, it hardly ever happens.
If you really wanna get expelled,
you can't just rock the boat.
You have to drive it up onto the rocks,
set fire to the galley, and dance on the burning deck.
You have to take it all the way.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Make your calls.
Oh, tip for best reception.
On top of the cupboard.
Hi, Ruby, I miss you. I'm gonna escape, though, I promise you.
You have no idea what it's like here.
Ew! Who is she?
Zero lip-gloss upkeep and what's with the sweater from Target?
and what's with the sweater from Target?
I wish you could come and rescue me.
Oh, she is such a romantic, Roddy.
Take care of Roddy for me.
You already have. Let's hit the pool.
Watch it, Wee Willie Winkie, you'll set us all alight.
I've had a word with the girls.
True, some of them took a little more convincing than others,
but it's decided. We're gonna help you.
We're your very own crack unit.
Operation Freedom. Kiki, please explain.
Kiki, please explain. Right. We'll commence with an entry-level basic favorite,
Right. We'll commence with an entry-level basic favorite, just to get warmed up.
It smells like pee in here. Does not smell like-- Bonjour, les filles.
(all) Bonjour, Monsieur  Nellist. (Kiki) But it's not good just playing the same old tricks.
Try to be as imaginative as possible.
Only do things that will get you noticed.
Vary your targets as much as you can. And although we'll all be helping you,
And although we'll all be helping you,
the important thing to remember...
(phone rings) Harriet?
...is that you have to get the blame for everything.
Run along.
Speaking.
Headphones on, girls.
Come on, everybody. Don't run too fast in your flip-flops. We'll just jump in, have a quick paddle about,
We'll just jump in, have a quick paddle about,
warm up, then have tea and crumpets, yes?
Yes, I'm in school right now.
Regulation uniform? Skirt just below the knee.
Of course.
They are simple polyester, sturdy and practical.
No, I have certainly not been naughty.
My disciplinary record is exemplary.
Are you okay?
(phone clanks) -Get out! -Get out!
-Get out! -Get out!
(chattering)
(all repeating in French)
(gasps)
(stammers)
Uh, yes, thank-thank you very much. That's it, thank you.
(Kiki) If you make enough of a nuisance of yourself...
Poppy... Moore!
...she will eventually bow to pressure,
and she'll have to call your father.
Naturally, I'll call her father,
but she's had a difficult time.
No, Sara, please, it's all right.
-Mr. Nellist. -Oh, uh, sorry.
(Kiki) And then with any luck, she'll recommend you to the Honor Court.
she'll recommend you to the Honor Court.
Unbe-bloody-lievable!
She's got more lives than a Buddhist cat.
Kingley's not even mentioned Honor Court.
I think people are starting to like her.
People?
People can learn to get used to rotting pig's vomit,
if they live with it for long enough.
I believe she's trying to leave.
It'd be a nightmare if she stayed.
She makes a mockery of the system. She's not staying, take it from me.
She's not staying, take it from me.
Five generations of my family have made the school great.
The school motto is "scholarship, fellowship, loyalty,"
not "be a slutty, whorey, shit-brain."
(both) So brillianté, Harriet.
(sobbing)
(sobbing) I'm only sorry it can't be something stronger. Cup of tea.
Quick, give me the tape. Give me the tape.
Pull the button off.
Oh, my God, there's a car. -Get out. -Quick. (car approaches)
Whoa. It's all right, Cerberus, it's only me.
Who's Cerberus? The dog that guards the gates of hell.
(whispering)
Hurry up, or you'll disturb my girls.
Sorry, terrible allergies. (groaning)
Uh, sorry. Better an empty house than an angry tenant, right? Hmph.
I don't get it. It's like you've got immunity.
Your dad's a mafia guy or something.
Yep, I'm the "goddaughter."
Whatever it is, she's cutting you a lot of slack.
We need to up the ante.
In fact, we need to focus on her big weakness.
Oh, my God, you have to snog Freddie.
Snog? That sounds disgusting. What is that?
It's English for make out. Mrs. Kingsley will go ballistic.
And Harriet would have an absolute fit.
Well, that's a definite bonus.
And he'll be at the social. Cool.
Just remember, the point is to get caught.
All right, so what's the deal with the social?
It's the school dance on Saturday night.
Traditionally, it's fancy dress. This year it's movie magic.
This year it's movie magic.
But the only ones who bother to dress up are teachers,
morons, and Harriet.
I say we dress up fancy. Real fancy.
This mission needs to be planned precisely. Kiki?
Kiki?
Okay. Operation Freedom, part two, step one.
Okay. Operation Freedom, part two, step one. Attract Freddie.
Attract Freddie.
Step one, subsection "A", look the part.
Kiki, you're actually making something quite exciting
Kiki, you're actually making something quite exciting sound like physics homework.
Basically, we're going into town,
and we're gonna get some killer outfits.
I want something that says elegant,
but at the same time incredibly slutty and available.
In fact, I'm not that bothered about elegance.
"So, apparently, the key is to hook up
with the headmistress' son.
I'll do your trick, Rubes, swing my hips and giggle."
Oh, come on, Poppy, we're gonna miss the bus.
Don't forget to log off now, you ninny.
Everyone, sign out.
Remember you are representatives of the school.
Sign your own name, come on.
Poppy Moore, what are you wearing?
You are going to town,
not appearing in a window in Amsterdam.
Change immediately. I don't have anything else.
I thought you might be quite concerned by that attire, Matron.
by that attire, Matron.
So we had a little look-see in lost property on our way here, didn't we?
on our way here, didn't we?
(both) We did.
It'll suit you,
promise.
(girls giggling) That's cute. My grandma used to have a dog just like it.
My grandma used to have a dog just like it. Poppy, I think your jumper is the cat's pajamas.
Poppy, I think your jumper is the cat's pajamas.
Come on, girls, in you go, hurry up.
Upstairs to the seats.
Don't push. Don't push. Plenty of room.
Come on, here we go. -Poppy! -Come on, Poppy!
-Poppy! -Come on, Poppy! -Poppy, jump! -I can't find my sanitizer!
I can't find my sanitizer! You left it in the dorm!
Oh, my God, no! Oh, my God!
(all) Run!
(heavy metal music playing) Oh, my God, look.
-Oh. -Hi! Ew. Gross.
Ew. Gross.
Where are we going?
To our favorite shop.
Cancer research?
Girls, I'm all about finding a cure,
but considering I flunked chemistry, I don't know how much help I'm gonna be.
And BTW, which FYI means "by the way,"
this is supposed to be shopping time. We're not gonna be doing  the research.
We're not gonna be doing  the research.
This is a charity shop.
The money goes to charity.
Oh, I just had a heart palpitation.
You guys are so adorable,
but we need to look really hot for the social.
So let's go hit Oxford Street.
I take it you flunked geography, too.
Oxford Street is in London, my friend.
This is your lot.
(chattering)
Hey, Kate, what about this for Ascot? Magnificent.
Magnificent.
Is this too workaday? (sighs)
Come on now, girls, this is a serious mission.
Come on now, girls, this is a serious mission. Get a move on.
Now, Poppy, how about something like this?
Now, Poppy, how about something like this? Fifty pence.
It looks like someone died in it.
I'd rather stay the Yorkshire Terrier freak.
You're a Buddhist, right?
Think of it as clothing reincarnation.
Honey, even Buddha wouldn't be caught dead in half this stuff.
Still, I guess anything's possible.
Come on, let's do this.
Unbelievable, this season Marni. It's sophisticated, it's elegant.
It's sophisticated, it's elegant. -Hot to trot. -Check.
-Hot to trot. -Check.
If we could just call this stuff vintage and add like three zeroes to the price tag,
I could totally get into it.
Perfection. Operation Freddie is well and truly underway.
Malibu moment! Remember what I taught you guys?
(all) Who are we? (camera shutter clicks)
I think he's down a penny black.
Yes, dated prewar.
(chattering)
Oh, my God! It's Tom Cruise.
Would you like to say any louder? I need your help.
And I need a back wax and a night with Michael Bublé,
but we don't always get what we want.
Trudy, attend to the brows.
Mmm. Yorkie fan. It's a nice dog, Yorkie. I used to have one once. Wee Phillippe.
I used to have one once. Wee Phillippe.
Got savaged to death by a badger. Ow!
Aren't you the soufflé that didn't arise?
Tell me about it.
Okay, I need these extensions taken out,
a serious deep conditioning.
I'm thinking side bangs with some buttery highlights,
and maybe a few honey tones.
Oh! And I'd like a night on Fireman Island,
but I'm afraid I'm whistling Dixie, okay?
So, here's what's on offer for you.
A tight perm. -No. -How about this?
-No. -How about this? A wee bob. That's fun, isn't it?
A wee bob. That's fun, isn't it? -No. -Okay.
What about this? Oh, a pineapple.
Oh, Hawaii. No.
What about something a little bit more natural?
Natural? Aye. The real you. Hmm.
Natural it is. Radical.
Okay, ladies, let's do this. ♪
All right, I'll need that, that, that. Mm.
Oh, oh! Oh, no.
Look it. Mmm. That's not mine. Hmm, nope.
Hey, Mommy, two strong teas, please. Bella pronto.
Don't you look at me like that.
(scissors clipping)
You ready, hen? -Um-hm. -Okay.
-Et voila. -Wow. Thank you.
Oh, you're welcome, darling. I'm cream-crackered.
I'll lay down and have a wee Satsuma.
-You look so-- -English.
I look like my mom.
Is she beautiful, too?
She was... very.
Sorry. Foot-in-mouth disease.
(giggling)
Okay, time for the juice. Any bright ideas?
Leave it to me, I've got a plan.
So, Susan, do you like your new office?
I don't know what's worse,
my job or that husband of mine.
Keith from accounts is driving me crazy.
He wants that report on his desk by Thursday. What's the report about?
What's the report about?
Oh, um, business. (whispers) What?
Do you want to buy a carpet tomorrow? Yes, after I've dropped the kids off at the pool...
Yes, after I've dropped the kids off at the pool...
...in my saloon car.
Two bottles of Grizinksy and one of Donmatsa, please.
Oh, and two crème eggs, please.
Why did you order the crème eggs, you idiot?
Why did you only get two, Drippy? Now we've got to quarter them?
He believed us till then. Oh, yeah, right.
Maybe if you hadn't asked me what Keith's report was about.
Where's Poppy?
-Are you okay? -I'm furious.
Stupid Drippy.
I know. Never mind, let's go. ♪ Oh, heaven's a place on earth ♪
Would you boys like a drink?

-Mr. Nellis-- -Harriet's coming.
Right. Yes, yes.
Mr. Darcy?
What undue pleasure it is to be afforded your company.
Hi.
You may only call me Mrs. Darcy

Okay. Cool.

Lips, hips, hips, and butt.

I like your hair. What are you doing?
This is a themed costume party,
not a dwarf prostitutes' convention.
I'm so sorry. I must say that you look incredible.
You make an excellent Shrek.
This is my favorite song, come on.
Go, girlfriend! That is entirely wicked.
♪ Put you up on your feet the whole night now ♪ ♪ Pop them bottles and drink that up, man ♪
Hey, are you okay? Oh, you're awesome.
She okay? Shall I call an ambulance?
You can be sick in my hands if you'd like. She's acting like she's drunk.
She's acting like she's drunk. She should be taken to bed.
Freddie can do the honors.
You really are a horridious piece of work.
Mr. Darcy don't think so.
She's just a little concussed. She just needs some air.
-Great idea. -Come on.
She's up to something. Follow them. Report back to me.
So, explain yourself, Miss Moore.
(mimics English accent) I'm afraid I can't explain myself, sir...
(in normal voice) ...because I'm not myself right now you see.
Said Alice to the caterpillar.
You're right, how'd you know?
I was Alice in the school play.
All boys before you look at me weirdly.
Hey.
You so don't need to play hard to get. I'm totally into you.
Hey, come on. Calm down.
Okay, leading lady, all-boys school, awkward with intimacy. Cards on the table.
awkward with intimacy. Cards on the table. -Are you gay? -(chuckles)
Uh, just English.
And I am sober and sensible. And you, my sweet friend, are overexcited and concussed.
And you, my sweet friend, are overexcited and concussed.
I go back to school tomorrow, but I'll be back on the 18th.
How about I see you then?
Okay.
I'll make a deal.
No more head-fry behavior. I sense that might be your forte.
I won't fry your head, if you don't poach my heart.
Deal. (Jane clears throat)
Oh, crap. Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
Fraternizing with the girls, Freddy Kingsley, as you are well aware, is not allowed.
Poppy Moore, get back inside. Immediately.
Tell Harriet.
She won't just shoot the messenger,
she'll skin us alive first.
Me think not.
We think not.
Nice work, Kate.
So, is Operation Freddie well and truly underway?
God knows? Harriet didn't come.
So it just depends on whether Tweedledum or Tweedledee decide to tell her.
There's nothing to worry about. -Clearly not. -Right.
-Clearly not. -Right.
We're gonna have to come up with an addendum to Plan B.
Isn't it ironic how my ticket out of here
just might be the reason I wanna stay?
I mean, one of the reasons, anyways.
Someone call Al Gore. I think the ice queen is melting.
What an excellent night.
Eight boys have actually come up and directly spoken to me.
Now, for all you lovers out there.
It's your final chance.
It's the last dance.
Come on!
(chattering)
There's something I have to tell you.
Oh, we already know.
You wax your bum. No.
Not quite, but similar ballpark.
You haven't done it, have you?
No. I mean, I couldn't admit it back home, so I kind of lied, but I'm a total nun.
so I kind of lied, but I'm a total nun.
Welcome to the nunnery.

Come on, girls.
If we lose today, we're out of the championship again.
Perhaps you'd like to explain last night to me.
Kate?
I'm sorry. We just got a little bit carried away.
Well, as I understand it, Drippy got totally carried away
by Mr. Nellist and Miss ReesWithers,
after she lay in a pool of her own vomit.
Actually, it was Kate's vomit, Mrs. Kingsley.
I was just lying in it.
I expect better of you two. You know the values we stand for at Abbey Mount.
And as for you, Poppy,
I don't know whether to be pleased that you've finally made some friends here
or furious that you've led them astray.
Dismissed.
Not you, Miss Moore.
I gave your father my word that I'd try and help you, but I'll be honest,
but I'll be honest, you're making it awfully difficult.
You're cleverer and better than this, Poppy.
Why don't you give yourself a chance?
Try. Try at something.
Show him that you can rise to the occasion.
Because, judging by the outfits you created last night,
when you put your mind to something you can do it.
Don't give up on yourself.
Because I haven't and neither has your father.
Now off you go.
Ugh, I really do feel sick.
-What did she want? -Oh, nothing.
-What did she want? -Oh, nothing. Just a good spa destination.
Come on, guys! Come on!
Oh, God, I feel really vile. I think I'm gonna puke.
Oh, God, I feel really vile. I think I'm gonna puke. Seriously, Poppy, you're gonna have to take my place.
Seriously, Poppy, you're gonna have to take my place.
There's only seven minutes left.
Oh, cripes! Um...
Poppy can take my place. Don't worry, Miss Rees-Withers,
Don't worry, Miss Rees-Withers,
we'll play one man down.
We don't want to carry dead weight.
No offense. Oh, none taken.
Oh, none taken. But seeing as how you don't want me playing on your team,
well, I'm friggin' playing.
Ugh! -Into the bucket. -(wretches)
Josie, on the wing! Poppy, go long!
All right. Wow, okay.
Let's just pretend the ball is the last size five pair of Manolos at Barney's.
Okay.
Let's pull it out the bag. Offense, yeah!
Eyes on the prize.
Aah, Josie!
Eye on the prize. Oh, my God!
Josie, help!
Poppy, roll over it or pick it up!
-Yeah! -You go, girlfriend. Dunk that bitch.

All right, people, choose a goal buddy.
From now on, each sentence starts with "I will,"

"I will" want to saliva vomit if we have to call each other "buddy".

"Dear Ruby,
today is my big date with the headmistress' son, Freddie.
Wish me luck. I may be out of here before you know it.
Lover boy's waiting outside for you. (giggling)
But, remember, you want someone to catch you out.
So stay near school and good luck.
Thanks. Fingers crossed.
Ah, Freddie Kingsley.
Nice to finally see you when I'm not delirious -or, uh, half-naked. -Don't speak too soon.
-or, uh, half-naked. -Don't speak too soon.

Hey, I thought maybe we could take a romantic stroll around the school grounds. (laughs)
And get caught? Are you out of your mind?
Call me old-fashioned, but I actually do quite like living.
I thought you said you could drive.
It's not my fault your stupid car doesn't work.
Have you ever thought of changing gears?
That's the car's job.
Turn right here.
We drive on the left in this country. Whatever.
And so I threw the whole lot over the cliff.
My dad went mental, as Drippy would say.
Drippy said I was crazy,
but Kate said she would have done exactly the same in my position.
Sorry, chattering away like this.
Feel free to shut me up.
Well, remind me to never to get on your bad side.
But the thing is...
I'm pretty sure you don't have one.

You'll never believe it.
What happened?

you cannot imagine how retarded these idiots are.
They're a bunch of ugly losers who think a mani-pedi
They're a bunch of ugly losers who think a mani-pedi is a Latin greeting.
I despise these village idiots,

Still they're so sick, they'll never realize I'll be out of this asylum
they'll never realize I'll be out of this asylum by the end of term."
I didn't write that. I mean hardly any of it... just the loser part.
But that was weeks ago.
Well, it's dated today and it's from your e-mail address.
Where did you get it? It was taped to the door.
You're a seriously horridious cow.
Come on, guys, you have to believe me.
Just forget it, okay?
Why would you do that?
You can't believe I actually wrote this.
All we did was try to make your life here happier, Poppy.
I thought we were friends.

I can't right now. You know the limo's coming in five, and I have nada to wear.

Oh, not the Jimmy Choos. They don't match, for Christ's sake.
Rubes, I just need some advice. Something really bad has happened.
Oh, crap, fashion emergency.
Gotta go, see you soon as. I love you.
I love you more.

I didn't mean to do it, It was an accident. I thought I put it out. I-I thought I'd stopped it.

Help me get everyone out before it spreads.

Fire, fire! Everyone get up!
Fire! It's a real fire! Get out of bed! It's a fire! This isn't a practice!

Hey, stop her!
Drippy! Drippy!

What's going on?
What do you think happened? Don't know yet.
We're lucky, could've been a lot worse.
Well done, Poppy, you saved us.
You're brilliant.
Hey. I believe this is yours.
Thank you.
Do you realize you could've killed her? Well done, thanks, Poppy.
You could've killed all of us. I didn't mean to.
I thought I'd stopped it, I swear.
I don't understand, okay? I heard footsteps, and then I put it out.
I was just so upset at everything,
and I wish I hadn't have done it.
I really wish you hadn't done it, too.
Someone here knows exactly what happened last night.
What we're clear on is that this fire was no accident.
If you have the sense to own up, no legal charges will be filed.
If not, it will be passed on to the local authorities.
You have until the end of the day to come forward.
"Dear Freddie, How can I begin to say I'm sorry?
You are good and honest and true.
And, well, I'm the opposite.
But I'm learning.
So, now, I'm going to do the right thing.
And if it means I have to leave here, I just want you to know I promise you I never wrote that e-mail.
I promise you I never wrote that e-mail.
For a moment, there, yeah, you were my ticket out of here,
but then I got to know you.
I have never felt this way before about anyone,
and I really need you to know that."
Come in.
Oh, what can I do for you, Poppy?
It's what I used to start it.
It was an accident, and, uh, I thought I put it out.
But I guess not.
Obviously not.
Oh, Poppy.
You realize what this means, don't you?
Will I be expelled?
The Honor Court will decide,
but I suspect you'll understand that it's just a formality at this point.
The weird thing is I really did try to turn it around.
I didn't want to disappoint you.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, too, Poppy.
Uh, do you think maybe you could give this to Freddie for me?
I told her it was me.
I'm going to the Honor Court and then I'll be leaving.
So, this is for you.
Well done. You finally got what you wanted.
You must be overjoyed.
I couldn't be more unhappy.
Oh, please, give it a rest.
Mom?
Hey, I've been looking for you.
Hi.
So, you're backed out of our deal.
What deal?
That you wouldn't fry my head.
Yeah.
But you poached my heart.
Hey, come on.
What if it doesn't have a moral?
Or says Alice.
I think I just fell down the rabbit hole and found it.
Look.
She looks exactly like you.
Yeah. She was my mom.
She went to this school.
I didn't even know.
Well, I guess it's time to face the music now.
(all talking at once)
Josie, I'm never wrong. When am I ever wrong? You're wrong when we did the math challenge.
Hey! She's confessed.
She's going to Honor Court this afternoon.
That's brave. And really stupid.
Because guess what I've discovered.
It is with great regret and sadness that we call the Honor Court to session.
The e-mails were sent 11:40 in the morning.
But, according to Drippy,
Poppy left the computer room a few minutes after 11:00.
I got my 11:00 Wagon Wheel,
and then I went to tell her that Freddie was waiting.
She left immediately.
I was able to access the keystroke order of the root file to find out who else
of the root file to find out who else was logged on there then.
And guess who the only other person was?
Who?
It will henceforth be our job to objectively and dispassionately ascertain
what happened that fateful night.
That will hence to forth long blight the memory of this proud institution.
When you think about it, Poppy would never say "term".
She calls it a bloody samosa or something.
-Semester. -Whatever.
Anyway, to check the reality,
I had a sneaky look in her diary for Friday's entry.
Don't do that.
Shut up and listen.
"I think, deep breath, I kind of love them
like proper friends I've known forever.
They've made me say words like 'horridious' and 'herbal.'
Which is sort of whack, and I'd probably hate them if I wasn't one of them.
But I like that I'm now one of them."
Apart from some atrocious spelling mistakes,
it's a little bit more kosher, don't you think?
And now she's gonna get thrown out.
It is your duty to understand the dark forces
It is your duty to understand the dark forces that drove a seemingly--
Harriet.
May I remind you that the Honor Court is no place for your personal grandstanding.
Look, Poppy has a right to speak in her own defense
before the court, as a whole, passes judgment.
Thank you, Mrs. Kingsley.
I won't insult everybody by trying to defend myself or my actions.
So, uh, I think it's safe to say that I've... I've really messed up,
and I apologize profusely.
But I'm also so grateful to you all.
I tried really hard to get out of this school.
And, only now, do I realize just how much I want to stay.
I've learned so much being here, being with all of you.
And, in some ways, being with my mom,
who I found out was actually a student here.
(whisperings) I've had a hole in my heart for five years,
I've had a hole in my heart for five years,
and somehow being here,
it slowly started to heal.
I know I may have looked like a California girl, but in my heart I've discovered
but in my heart I've discovered that I really am an Abbey Mount girl.
Objection! Sustained.
The court will heretofore disregard the previous statement.
And perhaps heretofore we can begin the real business.
Can you tell us, in your own words,
where were you on the aforementioned evening of--
Honestly, Harriet, who else's words do you expect her to use?
Just leave this to me.
Right. Sustained.
Poppy, were you in the cook's sitting room -on the night of the fire? -Yes, I was.
-on the night of the fire? -Yes, I was.
Were you there with permission?
No, I was not.
(whispering) Quiet, please. Silence in court.
Did you intend on starting a fire?
-Not really. -Objection!
-Not really. -Objection! Does the defendant mean yes or no?
-Harriet? -It means no.
-Harriet? -It means no. I had no intention of actually doing it.
Was anyone else with you?
Not as far as I know.
I was.
I was.
-I was. -I was.
-I was. -I was. I was.
I was. -I was. -I was.
-I was. -I was. (all) I was.
Objection! Stop! Order!
-I was. -I was. -Stop it! -Come on.
I was.
This is ridiculous!
What are you all doing? You're lying.
They're lying, Mrs. Kingsley.
Harriet, you're going down, biatch.
This is a conspiracy.
You can't expel the whole year, and they know that.
Be quiet, Harriet!
Sit down, everyone.
It's a black-and-white case.
She has to be expelled.
The girl set fire to the school,
endangering all our precious lives.
She walked in there, lighter at the ready,
and tried to burn the place down.
Lighter?
Not now, Jane. Have respect for court protocol.
What lighter, Harriet?
Jesus, Charlotte, how daft can you possibly be?
That ridiculous I heart L.A. lighter of hers.
She left it behind, for God's sakes.
Except how do you know that, Harriet?
No one's mentioned a lighter before.
(whispers) What? Yes, they have.
Objection.
Actually, Harriet, they haven't.
I have to second Jane's question, Harriet.
How did you know about that lighter?
Well, I-I had--
Freddie found the lighter before anyone saw it.
How could you possibly know unless...
unless you were there.
Well, this is absurd. I refuse to sit here and listen to these wild--
I had put it out.
And I heard footsteps. It must've been you.
Oh, my God, you restarted the fire, didn't you?
Harriet, is this true? Of course not.
It all makes sense now, I knew it.
I think I'm innocent.
(both) We think so, too.
You're not, you awful bitch!
You've turned this school upside down.
You've ruined everything! You started it.
I only finished what you started!
Harriet?
My office, now.
(cheering)
Okay, suckers, show time.
Let's open a can of whoop-ass.
Let's open a can of whoop-ass. Come on, Abbey Mount. You can do it!
Come on, Abbey Mount. You can do it!
Let's go Abbey Mount!
Come on, girls.
Take it! Come on!
(cheering)
Come on, guys, we can bring it back. Let's go.
You got it!
Mrs. Kingsley? Oh, Mr. Moore, you made it. Yes, I did.
Please, please, come and take a seat.
-Did I miss much? -Not at all.
Where's Poppy?
She's right there.
She's the spitting image of her mother, isn't she?
She most certainly is.
Come on, Abbey Mount! Take it out there!
Come on! Come on, Poppy!
Come on! Come on, Poppy! Come on!
Come on, Abbey Mount! Let's go! (whistle blows)

Why didn't you just tell me, Dad?
I'm sorry, Poppy. I thought it might make you too sad.
I did know that you needed to breathe a different kind of air, though.

You did.

Huh! Nobody.
Just some horridious cow I used to know.
-Can't do it. -No way.
You're completely insane.
[screaming] Somebody, help!
Help me!
Gin!
Read 'em and weep.
Finally!
-All right. -You ready?
-War. -War?
We're not playing war. War's not even a game.
-[Stacy] We are too playing war. C'mon. -[Jeff] It's total chance, Stace.
Winner picks the game, Jeff. That's your rules.
Thank you, Amy.
Okay. War.
[Eric] Okay, who wants a little Mexican hair of the dog?
Señorita Margarita.
-[Amy] I'll have some. -[Eric] Oh, you'll definitely have some.
-Come on, Jeff. -No, keep that away from me.
Well, that's not what you were saying last night.
[laughs] Seriously, Mr. Nude Lifeguard. What was up with that?
I don't know what you guys are talking about.
One, two, three, four, I declare war.
[Jeff] You're burning up, honey.
-What do you mean? -You're all red.
-No, I'm flushed. I'm just hot. -You're not flushed.
-I finally won. -Good.
-[Eric] I knew you would. -[Stacy] You did?
Okay. [Eric] I did. Of course I did.
-Shit! -[Jeff] What?
I lost my earring.
Why don't you look under the towel there?
Is it under your chair?
-[Amy] Look under your towel. -[Stacy] It's not.
-[Amy] Under your towel. -Why would it be under our towel?
-[Amy] I don't know, I think I was... -Did you come lay under here?
[Jeff] We're gonna find it, honey. [Amy] It's my favorite earring.
[Stacy] It's probably in the pool.
[speaking with a German accent] I found it. It's yours, I think.
-[Stacy cheering] -[Mathias] Yeah?
Thank you so much! [Jeff] Thank you.
It's not a problem.
Hey, do you want a drink?
Yeah, sure. Thank you.
-It's got ice in it. -[Mathias] It's okay.
It's blended.
-That means it has ice, Eric. -[Mathias] Thank you.
-Where are you from? -Munich, originally.
Stace, it's just ice.
No, it's not. The water system here is contaminated with human feces.
Okay? So your drinks are, like, blended with hepatitis B.
-[Amy] Yes. Hepatitis B. -How do you know each other?
They're best friends, and we're their boyfriends.
Cool.
[Jeff] How about you? Are you here by yourself? Uh-uh.
No, with my brother, but he left with some girl, yeah.
[Jeff] Left here? Mexico or...
Oh, no, no. She's an archaeologist. He went with her to a dig site.
And what are they digging? [Jeff] Like an excavation?
Yeah, it's ruins, I think. A Mayan temple.
[Jeff] Kind of like the ones that nobody here wanted to go to...
-Yes, Jeff. -...the entire time that we've been here.
Apparently, it's not even in the guidebooks.
VIP only.
Yeah, see, Jeff, that's something I would do.
-Oh, yeah? -[Stacy] Sounds like fun.
[Mathias] Well, if you're interested, I'm going there tomorrow.
Heinrich was supposed to be back by now,
but he must be having a good time.
So what do you guys think? [Jeff] Huh? Ancient Mayan temple off the beaten path?
[Jeff] Huh? Ancient Mayan temple off the beaten path?
I don't know, a little culture before we leave?
-I wanna go. -You will?
-I wanna go. -You will? Yeah.
Since I just kicked Jeff's ass in cards, I got nothing left to do here.
-[Eric] Wow! -[chuckles]
Wow.
-Wow. -Say something.
Eric?
Well, yeah, I mean, as long as I'm back for make-your-own-taco night, I'm in.
Amy?
Do we have to wake up early?
You come to beach tonight? To party?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
They are supposed to be coming with me tomorrow,
but maybe it's a big mistake.
-They're all fucking crazy in the head. -[all laughing]
So, there was this hotel heiress who dyed her hair blonde.
[Stacy] But the carpet didn't match the drapes.
[Eric] So she stripped it away.
What is it? What's the joke? What's so funny? I'm not...
[Eric] You don't want to know, Mathias.
But the hardwood floor underneath it was all scuffed up and dirty!
[Eric laughs] So she buffed it.
-[Stacy] But then it was too slippery. -Ow!
Who's gonna dance with me?
[Amy] Come on. Come on.
I'm just not feeling this one.
Jeff, buddy, we got two days left. I wanna see some moves.
[Amy] It's just like playing the trombone.
Jeff used to play the trombone in high school.
-[Eric guffaws] Jeffrey on the trombone! -[Amy] He won a prize.
Thank you for sharing that with everybody.
Now he's gonna be a doctor.
And he's gonna win a prize for that.
-[Dimitri] Mathias! -[group cheering] [Amy] Hey, the Greeks!
[Eric] Hey, what's up? How are you?
-Amy! Amy! -[Jeff] No, no! No!
-Amy! No, no, no, no! -[Stacy] Amy!
I'll take some. I'll take some.
I have her.
Amy, it's time to go to bed. Let's go.
No, I don't want to.
[Jeff] Come on.
All right, I'm calling it a night, guys. -[giggling] -[Jeff] Good night. Give me a kiss.
-[giggling] -[Jeff] Good night. Give me a kiss.
-Come here. Stay. -[Jeff] Give me a kiss.
-See ya, buddy! -[Jeff] Make sure she gets home.
-Night, Jeff! -[Jeff] Okay?
-[Jeff] See you guys tomorrow morning. -[Eric] All right.
-Yeah. -[Eric] Be good, man.
-[Amy] My boyfriend, the rock star! -[Jeff] Behave.
-[Amy] Matteo! -Mathias.
Mathias.
Show me a German dance. Come on.
-You want a German dance? -Mmm-hmm.
Like a waltz?
-[giggles] Come on! -Yeah...
Drag you?
Nobody wants to dance!
[Mathias] You want me to dance? I can't dance. [Amy] It's so beautiful!
So, how much you wanna bet she kisses him?
She's freaking out 'cause Jeff's med school is like 2,000 miles away, okay?
-[Mathias] You do a twirl. -[Eric] Okay, how much?
[Stacy] She's not gonna kiss him. That's nice.
-It's good, yeah? -How do you do that?
{Eric] All right, you know what?
Oral sex. Winner receives.
-Oral sex. Okay. -Mm-hmm.
All right, more of the hips. Use the hips. Like this.
-[Amy giggles] -Jeff's a nice guy, yeah.
Come here. Come here. I wanna tell you a secret.
Amy! -[laughs] -Amy!
-[Eric] Yes! -[Stacy] Amy!
[Stacy] What are you doing? What are you doing?
I will dance with you, okay?
Crazy Greeks.
[Mathias] No. The place that they went, here.
It's only on this old map. It's gone from the guidebook.
[Jeff speaking German] Good morning.
[panting] What are you doing?
He's making a copy of the map from the girl Heinrich met, for his friends.
Yes, your friends look like they could use a map.
All right. Give me a couple of minutes?
-Rally the troops? -Yeah.
-Half an hour in the lobby? -Yeah.
-Okay. -All right.
Do you know what they do to people down here who don't honor their bets?
Bus leaves in like 15 minutes.
-They smash their hands. -Mmm-hmm.
[Eric] No, they do. They take broomsticks,
and they just like, whack, smash their hands.
It's a true story. It's kind of brutal, but it happens.
What are you gonna do?
-Get up! Get up! -Come on!
Come on! Jeff's gonna be pissed if we miss it.
The terrible wrath of Jeff,
followed, I'm sure, by the even more frightening whining of Amy.
She's not that bad.
No, but I bet she's feeling pretty awkward right about now, don't you?
Don't say anything.
I mean it. Not a word.
-Come here. -Come on!
Look, it'd be a shame to smash these pretty little hands.
Will you please get in the shower?
Come here for a second. Come here. Come here.
You know, you're in Mexico now, muchacha.
And you can't just lose a bet like that and expect to walk away free.
How much do I owe you again?
I'll be quick. So quick.
[Jeff] Okay.
-You okay? -I'm fine.
You don't sound fine, honey.
Hey, that's really helpful, thanks.
Here you go. Come on.
Let's get going.
-Maybe I shouldn't go. -What?
You're gonna be back tonight. I'll just, like, sleep until then.
You wanna spend our last day sleeping?
I'll just hang out, like read or something. -[Amy gargling] -Amy, come on.
-[Amy gargling] -Amy, come on.
[Jeff] People come from all over the world just to see these ruins.
And this one isn't even on the map.
[Jeff] I'm not taking you to some tourist trap, honey.
Don't you wanna have some experience or something to shoot,
other than just the beach, the pool, the beach, the pool?
Well, you're already dressed. You might as well just go without me.
Hey.
But I don't wanna go without you.
-Okay, let's go. -Yeah?
Okay, let's go. -Okay. -[knocking on door]
-[giggles] -Ready?
[Amy] What are you so happy about?
Watch out for that.
[Eric] I'm sorry.
[Stacy] Wow.
-[Stacy] Amy, there's a puppy! -[Mathias] Heinrich?
Hello?
-[speaking in Greek] -What? I don't know.
So, now what?
We take taxi.
-How far? -Eighteen kilometers.
Hey, how many miles is that?
[Jeff] It's about eleven. Maybe a little bit more.
[Mathias] Then there's a path, which we hike for four kilometers.
[Jeff] Two and a half miles.
Okay, no one said anything about a hike.
[Stacy] Amy!
-[Amy] Stacy! -[Stacy] Come here!
Well, I don't see any cabs. That's a bit of a problem.
-What? -[speaking Greek]
-Yeah. -I don't know what you're saying.
-[Mathias laughs] -There we go.
[Stacy] Why?
[Amy] No, it's good. Is there a mirror?
-[speaking Spanish] -[knocking]
How much... you drive us here?
No, no. This place, no good.
I'll drive you to pyramid. Muy grande. Everybody go.
I take you. I take you.
[Eric] Yes.
-Hey! Amy, Stace! -[Stacy] Bye, puppy!
[Amy] I wanna stay with the puppy.
-[Jeff] Let's go! -[Eric] You guys ready?
-[Stacy] We got new hats. -[Eric] Very nice.
-This is the taxi? -Yeah, this is it. Come on. Let's go.
-[Stacy] My pants are gonna get dirty. -[Amy squealing]
Hey, Jeff. Can you give me some water?
Take a picture.
[Jeff] Is this it? [Mathias] Yeah, this must be.
[Eric] How you feeling?
-[Jeff] Yeah. -[Eric] Okay.
[Amy] Oh, my God, I'm so glad that's over.
-[Eric] You okay? -[Stacy] My jeans are all dirty.
-[Eric] You okay? -[Stacy] My jeans are all dirty. -[Jeff] Do you have a telefono? -[Amy] Thanks.
-[Jeff] Do you have a telefono? -[Amy] Thanks.
[Stacy] Bye, puppy!
Wait, how are we gonna get back?
We're gonna call him when we get out.
With what? We're not gonna get a signal out here.
My phone should work. It's a world phone.
Hello? Can you hear me now?
It's not funny, Eric.
It's like a 20-mile hike I'm gonna do in flip-flops.
-Eleven. -It's a little funny.
Yeah, it's working.
-[Jeff] Problem solved. -[Amy] Can I have my sunglasses?
-[Eric] Is that your brother's Jeep? -Yeah, it is.
[Amy] It's not funny.
It's a little funny.
We go. Coming?
[Eric] Yeah, yeah. Come on, let's go. Ready?
-[Stacy] Yeah. -Come on.
Want a piggyback ride?
-[Amy] No. -[Stacy] No?
[Eric] So, there was this girl who got really, really drunk one night.
[Stacy] But she sobered up really, really quickly.
Who is this?
[Amy] Just a stupid game that they were playing last night.
[Eric] But not before she stuck her tongue down some guy's...
-Eric. -...throat.
How much further is it?
We cross a stream, then there should be a path to the left.
If we've seen a village, then we've gone too far.
-Wait, there's a village? -Yeah. A Mayan village.
Why did we leave the hotel again?
-Are you okay? -Yeah.
Just almost fell.
-[Eric] Fucking stinks. -[Stacy] Whoa.
[Amy] You stink.
How much further past the stream is it?
[Mathias] Right after, it says.
[Eric] Yeah, well, I don't see any path.
Can I have some... Thanks.
[Stacy] My legs are sore.
Look!
-[greeting in Spanish] -Don't scare them.
I'm not gonna scare them. Hello!
They look sad.
-[camera clicking] -[Stacy] Hello?
-[Eric] You wanna go talk to them? -[Stacy] Yeah.
[Amy] Maybe they can guide us.
[Amy] I don't think they speak Spanish.
Look.
[Stacy] Where's he going?
[Mathias] It's here. This must be it.
[Amy] That's the path?
Why was it covered?
[Stacy] I don't think that's the right path.
-It's on the map? -[Mathias] Yeah.
-It's on the map. -Jeff, do you see how old that map looks?
And it was covered. Why would it be covered?
Maybe the archaeologists don't want people to find their site, guys.
Great. They're gonna be thrilled to see us then.
No, maybe they just found something valuable,
and they don't want people to rob it,
and just get the Mayans to keep people away.
[Eric] How far away is it? [Mathias] It's not far.
Just feels weird. [Jeff] Well, what do you wanna do?
[Jeff] Well, what do you wanna do? Just turn around and walk all the way back?
[Amy] A hidden path in the middle of the jungle.
[Eric] So, do you think those kids were Mayans?
I mean, aren't the Mayans extinct?
Didn't they die of some fucked-up disease?
[Amy] Oh, that's great, Eric.
[Eric] We could be walking through an ancient graveyard right now.
Like a bone depository or something.
-[Stacy] I doubt it. -[Eric mimicking] I doubt it.
Did you just mimic me?
[Eric] No, no, I was agreeing with you.
[Amy] He was totally mimicking you.
[Eric] Was I? Was I really?
[Eric] Wow.
[Jeff] Oh, wow, look at that.
-[Amy] Is... I think this is it. -[Stacy cheering] Finally!
[Jeff] See, honey?
-[Eric whistles] -[Stacy] Wow.
-[Stacy] It's beautiful. -It is.
[Amy] Can I have my glasses? -[Jeff] Yeah. -[Eric laughs]
-[Jeff] Aren't you glad you came? -Here.
[Mathias] Look, that's it.
[Eric] Well, we made it.
[Stacy] Can I have a drink? Thank you.
[Stacy] Can I have a drink? Thank you. [Amy] Hey, Stace.
-[Stacy] Mexico! -[camera clicking]
[Amy] Mathias?
Is that a tent?
[Eric] Where?
[Mathias] Up there in the corner.
Heinrich!
Maybe he wants some money.
What, like a toll or something?
Amy, stop.
What the fuck do they want?
Show a picture of your brother.
On the phone.
Wait.
-[Jeff] We're trying to find... -You seen him?
-Amy, don't move! Amy! -[Eric] Stop!
-Okay. -Don't move. Just don't move.
Give to them! Give to them fotografia!
-Jeff! -Give to me camera.
[Amy] Hey!
-What the hell was that? -[Mathias] Dimitri.
-Want the camera? -[men yelling in foreign language] Easy. Easy, just...
-[men yelling] -Stop!
-[Stacy] Amy! Amy! -[Amy] Oh, God!
[Amy] Jeff!
[Mathias] Heinrich!
[Stacy gasping] I need to stop.
[Stacy] I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Stace. Stace. Look at me.
-I can't breathe. -[Jeff] Stacy! Look at me!
[Eric] Come on, we gotta go! Come on!
[Amy] There's more coming!
Heinrich!
[Stacy gasping] Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, God. [Amy] Oh, my God, Dimitri!
[Amy] Oh, my God, Dimitri!
[Stacy] Oh, my God.
[Amy sobbing] Why would they do that?
[Stacy] I can't breathe.
Eric, get your phone out.
There's no signal.
[panting] Really? If there was a signal on the road, you should be able to--
-No, I didn't get one. -What do you mean?
No, I mean, I never said... "Can you hear me now?" What the fuck was that, Eric?
"Can you hear me now?" What the fuck was that, Eric? What the fuck? It was a joke!
[Stacy] Stop! Stop! Both of you, stop! Please!
Mathias had a signal.
Where's your phone?
The man. He took it.
Is it the dig?
[Mathias] Heinrich?
[Jeff] Maybe there's another way down.
[Jeff] They keep coming.
-[Jeff] They're setting up camps. -[Amy] Why are they doing this?
Maybe they're preparing for something, you know. Like a...
Like a sacrifice?
It has something to do with the ruins.
They won't come up here. And now that we're here, they won't let us leave.
And now that we're here, they won't let us leave.
So, what do we do, just wait for someone to find us?
Who?
The Greeks.
Dimitri left them a copy of the map before we left.
Yeah, and what if they decide not to come, Jeff?
Then somebody else will.
We're supposed to check out of the hotel tomorrow.
The hotel's gonna call the police.
When?
Tomorrow or the day after.
Our flight is tomorrow, Jeff. I know, Amy.
But we know what happens if we leave.
Yeah, but what are we gonna eat? Like, where do we sleep?
We should save this.
Hey, she's thirsty.
I know. We just don't have that much.
Well, why do you get to decide, Jeff?
Okay. Well, we can all decide.
But just keep in mind that each of us needs a half a gallon of water every day,
just to survive.
And right now, we don't even have a day's worth.
Maybe he's right.
[Amy] What is that?
Hold on.
-[Stacy] A cell phone? A cell phone. -[Mathias] Heinrich!
-[Amy] Down there? -[Stacy] Yeah.
-Heinrich's. -Are you sure?
[Mathias] Yeah, it's his ringtone. We had the same phone.
[Amy] How can there be a signal? There's no signal up here.
[Eric] It's definitely a phone.
Amy, in the orange tent, there's a lantern hanging
and some matches on the ground. Can you get them?
[Jeff] Eric?
-Eric. -Yeah.
-Come figure this out. Drop that there. -Okay.
[Jeff] Come on. Amy? All right, pull it now.
-[Eric] This thing needs to be off, right? -[Jeff] Come on.
Okay, okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa! -[Mathias] I need the rope. -[Eric] You got it?
-[Mathias] I need the rope. -[Eric] You got it? [Jeff] Yeah, that's it. Let's do this.
-[Mathias] Okay. -[Jeff] Sure? You ready?
Yeah.
[Amy] Jeff? Jeff? [Jeff] Yeah?
-The rope, I think... -[rope snaps]
-Whoa. Up, up, up! -[Amy] Wait, wait, wait!
-[Jeff] Pull it up! Up! -Pull him up! Hurry!
-[Mathias] What? -[Stacy] Hurry!
[Mathias] What is it? What?
[Jeff] Oh, shit.
[Jeff] Mathias!
-Mathias? -[Jeff] Mathias?
-Oh, my God. -[Jeff] Jesus Christ.
Oh, Jesus. Fuck. Fuck. Oh, my God.
-[Amy] Is he... -[shushing]
No, I can hear him.
[Jeff] One of you has to go.
Go? Go where?
[grunts] Down. We're gonna check the rest of the rope
and make sure it's secure. Then one of you--
Why do we have to go? Why can't you or Eric?
[Jeff] 'Cause you're not strong enough.
We need to work the crank.
I'll go.
-You will? -Yeah.
[Jeff] Let me check.
[Amy] Thank you.
Just help him into the sling, and then we're gonna pull him out.
Once we get him out,
we'll drop the rope and pull you back up, okay?
-Stace? -Yeah?
-You okay? -Yeah.
Hey. You okay?
Yep.
Here you go.
Stace, you gotta step off. We got you.
Okay.
-[Amy] Okay? -Okay.
[Amy] You got it?
-[Jeff] Stacy? -What?
It's the end of the rope!
I'm not at the bottom!
[Jeff] How much further is it?
[Jeff] Can you jump?
Can I what?
[Jeff] Can you jump?
[Mathias] Please. Help me.
Okay.
-[groaning] -[Eric] Stace?
[Amy] You okay?
I cut my knee!
[Jeff] Can you see Mathias?
Yeah, but it's dark!
[Eric] We're gonna send the matches down.
Hurry!
Come on. Think.
[Jeff] What can we use?
[Eric] What about the tents?
You know, we could take one down, cut the nylon into strips.
I'm scared.
I can't move my legs.
[Stacy] You guys?
You guys, I think he broke his back! He can't move his legs!
And it smells!
Like what?
Like shit!
We're gonna have to build a backboard.
No way. We can't move him.
Look, we are not leaving him down there, okay?
How about the backpack frames and the tent poles?
[Amy] Are you listening to yourself? Okay, this is insane.
We have to wait for help, okay?
Stacy, we have to build a backboard!
[Stacy, softly] Okay.
Amy, there's tape in the tent.
Jeff, we cannot move someone with a broken back, okay?
-Amy, we have no choice. -You know that!
You have to go down and help lift him on!
[Amy] No.
-We have to tell them. -[Eric] Tell who?
We have to tell them. Maybe they could call someone. They can send for help.
They can send for help.
Amy, they're not gonna send for help.
No, we have to try, Jeff.
Amy. Amy! Amy!
Amy!
[Jeff] Amy.
Amy! Ame.
-Help us, please. -[man yelling in foreign language]
We need your help.
Someone's been hurt.
Amy, they can't understand you.
-Say it in Spanish. -They don't speak Spanish, Ame.
-Just try! -Ame.
Amy, they've already killed Dimitri.
I know you're scared.
-I didn't want to come. -Look at me. Amy.
-I didn't want to come. -Look at me. Amy. -I said I... -It's gonna be okay.
-I shouldn't be here. -We're gonna get out of this.
Okay? Ame?
Please. [whimpering]
-They have to help us. -Ame.
-They have to. No, they have to! -Ame, Ame!
-They have to. No, they have to! -Ame, Ame! -Amy! -[man speaking in foreign language]
I don't want us to get shot, Ame, please.
-Why won't you fucking help us? -[Jeff] Ame!
Ame. Ame.
[Amy] His mother was right there.
He touched the vine.
We all have.
-[grunting] -[phone continues ringing] [Jeff] Stacy?
[Jeff] Can you see it?
Is there anyone there?
I can't see it!
[tearful] I wanna come back up!
-Okay. -Okay.
-You okay? -Yeah.
All right, let's go.
Stace, I'm coming down!
A few more feet!
[Jeff] That's all there is!
-We have to send it back up. -[Stacy] No, no.
Amy, I can't stay down here any longer.
We can just lift him.
One of us at his shoulders, the other person at his feet.
What if he twists?
It's only a couple of feet, Amy. We can just lift him.
[Jeff] Can you still do it, Ame?
[Amy] Okay!
I'm gonna try!
Mathias.
Mathias, we're gonna lift you. -Okay? -[Mathias] Okay.
We're gonna lift you up and out of here.
Okay.
-His hips. -[Stacy] Are you sure?
[Amy] If you lift him at the feet, he's gonna bend at the waist.
Yeah, but I lift him here from his hips, it's gonna arch his back.
His knees.
[Amy] Okay, quickly. On three, okay?
One, two, three!
-[Mathias screaming] -[Amy] Oh, my! Oh, my God!
[Amy] Just get him on!
[Amy] Pull him up!
Maybe we should carry him into the tent...
Squeeze my hand.
...so he's not cold.
I don't think we should move him again.
Yeah, but we can't leave him out in the open like this at night.
Let's see if we can find him some aspirin or something, okay?
To keep his blood moving. Guys?
[Jeff] Look in the tents. Check the backpacks. See what you guys can find.
[Jeff] Guys?
Guys?
Look. Dimitri's plane ticket.
[Eric] How does that help us?
He was supposed to leave tomorrow morning.
On a 7:05 flight.
So when he doesn't show up tomorrow,
his friends are definitely gonna know that something's wrong.
How will they know where we are?
They have the map. Dimitri copied the map for them.
So they'll be here tomorrow.
We just have to make it through tonight. That's it.
Maybe one of us should keep watch while the other guys sleep.
Sleep?
It's working.
How is he?
We gotta keep his legs clean.
That's how it'll happen if it does.
If what does?
If he dies here.
Infection.
Jeff, he's not gonna die.
Ame?
Yeah?
I never should've said to lift him out, should I?
I never should have said to lift him.
-Just don't, Stace, okay? Please. -It's my fault. -[shushing] -[sobbing]
Stace?
We're gonna get him to the hospital tomorrow, okay?
He's gonna be okay.
Okay?
-We just gotta rest. -[sniffling]
Come on, Stace.
[Amy] The Greeks will be here tomorrow.
Stace, come on.
Give me your hand.
-Eric! -What?
-Oh, my God. -What is it?
-Eric! -What?
-Get it off! Get it off! -Okay, okay.
Oh, my God. It's inside my leg.
Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!
-Get it out! -[Eric] Okay, okay.
-Okay. -[whimpering]
Oh, my God!
-Okay, okay, okay. -Oh, my God.
Get it out.
What happened?
Help me.
Something's wrong.
Please. Something's wrong.
It's okay.
-I can feel it moving! -Stop! No. I got it out!
-It's moving! -Stace. What?
The vine, it was inside her.
-Show me my legs. -Okay.
-Show me them! -Okay.
[Amy] Jeff!
-[Amy] Jeff! -[Mathias] Help me, please!
Get it off me! Get it off! Jeff!
[Mathias] Help me!
[sobbing] Help me! Help me!
Take them off me!
Mathias! You just sit there and breathe. -[groaning] -Breathe, Mathias.
-[groaning] -Breathe, Mathias.
I'm gonna make a tourniquet right now and cut off this bleeding, Mathias.
It's on our clothes.
[Eric] It's... It's growing on us.
The phone.
I don't know how long these'll burn, so you're gonna have to be quick.
I'd wait to light them till you're both down there.
Link arms. One of you look to the right, the other, your left.
You'll cover more ground that way.
Search a spot and then move on. Okay?
Okay!
Okay.
[Stacy] Be careful.
Okay.
Amy, wait, wait.
Come on. We have to find it.
[Amy] Just stay next to me.
Amy?
[Amy] That's where it's coming from. -I can't. -Come on.
-I can't. -Come on. I don't wanna go in there. Amy.
We have to.
We have to find it.
[Amy] It's okay, come on.
-Okay. -[Stacy whimpers]
[Stacy] Okay. Ame?
Hello?
[Amy] The phone.
-It was just ringing. -Let me see.
[Stacy] Yeah. It's cracked.
Amy.
Amy! Amy!
-Oh, my God! -[both exclaiming]
Go!
Run, Stace! Go!
Amy!
Amy!
Jump on!
[screaming] Pull us up! Pull it up!
Pull!
Go!
Come on!
Come on!
-Are you okay, Ame? -Get it off!
Did you find the phone, Amy?
-It's not a phone! -Amy!
No, there is no fucking phone!
[Eric] What happened? Stace, what happened?
What do you mean, the flower was making the ring?
It was vibrating and it was ringing like a cell phone.
How? Amy, how does it do that?
[tearful] I don't know, Eric. I don't know.
It was moving. It was alive. It knows we're here.
-We just have to go. We just... -We can't do that, Stace.
Jeff, you didn't see it. Okay?
I'm not staying here.
If we try to leave, they kill us.
Mathias can't move. I can't just leave him here.
Okay, maybe we don't all have to go. I mean, I could go. I can get help.
They have guns, Eric.
There are 50 of them, 60. They killed that little kid, Amy.
[Eric] Okay, so you guys make a distraction.
-I can make it to the Jeep. I can do it. -It's too dangerous, Eric.
We have to wait. Wait for what, huh?
-For the Greeks. -Jeff,
the Greeks can't find their own fucking hotel room.
-Eric. -They're not gonna come out here
-Eric. -They're not gonna come out here -and rescue us. -We're being quarantined here.
We are being kept here to die!
[Jeff] This doesn't happen!
Four Americans on a vacation don't just disappear!
Somebody,
the police, our parents,
the Greeks,
somebody, somebody is going to find us.
We just have to be alive when they do.
Where are those keys, Amy?
[Eric] Amy, where are the keys? They're in the backpack.
No. We stay close. We wait until we're found.
We keep someone always on guard, we keep our wounds covered,
and we look out after each other. That is the only way.
Somebody's coming.
Somebody's coming.
One swallow apiece.
Stace.
[Stacy] It's still in there. I can feel it.
See, look how puffy it is.
[Eric] That's just swelling. It's natural.
[Amy] It's just what happens when you cut yourself, okay?
[Jeff] He won't last much longer like this.
We have to cut them off. Cut what off?
-His legs. -Tell me you're joking.
He'll die if we don't. Just please tell me you're joking.
He'll get infected, if he isn't already. Septicemia.
Well, what the hell is septicemia, Jeff?
An infection, usually in the bones, when it's exposed to bacteria.
You're fucking crazy.
No, I'm telling you, he won't last through the day like this.
Without anesthesia?
He has no feeling beneath his waist.
The tourniquets are already in place. We're gonna cut below them.
With what?
A knife?
We have to break the bones first and then cut.
We're not cutting his legs off with a fucking hunting knife, Jeff.
[Jeff] There's no flesh covering his bones, Eric.
He is going to die.
Okay. Okay, fine. Let's fucking vote.
You know, raise your hands if you want to cut off his legs.
Stacy, what are you doing?
He's in med school, Eric.
Yeah. Yeah, he's in med school.
He's not a surgeon. He's not a doctor. He's in school.
I'm entitled to my vote, Eric.
[Mathias] You do it.
Cut them off.
Cut them off.
Yeah.
I'll break the bones first, with the stone, then use the knife to cut through.
[weakly] Okay.
We're heating the pan to cauterize the wounds to stop the bleeding.
[Jeff] You're not gonna be able to feel a thing,
but if you want to bite down on this,
you can, just in case.
Eric, are you ready?
You should wait in the tent.
Grab his feet.
That foot. Turn it up.
Hold him down! Eric! Eric!
[screaming] God!
-[sizzling] -Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!
It's okay.
-Eric! -[Eric] Jeff!
[Jeff] Hold him fucking still!
Jeff!
-[whimpering] -Jeff, he felt it, didn't he?
[Amy] Jeff!
-He has nerve damage. -[Amy] Yeah?
He can't feel anything beneath his waist.
He was screaming, Jeff.
He was screaming. He was telling you to stop.
He was screaming. How could he not feel it when he was screaming?
It's just the visual.
-It was him looking down and seeing it. -This is so not okay!
We didn't have a choice, Amy.
Amy. It's...
[Amy whispering] Oh, my God. Holy shit.
[Stacy sobbing] Oh, God.
[Eric] What the fuck?
[Amy] Look, how can it do that?
[Stacy shivering] Check your phone.
Let me see.
[sobbing] I just wanna go home.
Do you think Stacy's gonna be okay?
Yeah.
I mean, I got it out. I saw it come out.
Yeah, she just really believes...
You know how she is.
She gets something in her head and...
she convinces herself.
[Amy] Do you think that they're... ever gonna find us?
Honestly?
I think making a run for it is our only chance.
[Amy sobbing] I know.
Amy, come here, come here.
[Stacy] Eric.
What the fuck?
What?
-I heard you. -You heard me what?
-I heard you. -You heard me what? I heard you fucking her.
Excuse me?
-Don't lie to me, Eric. I heard you. -Stace.
I heard you. I heard you fucking her!
[Eric] Stacy, come on.
[Stacy screaming] How could you do that to me?
How could you guys fucking sit there and fuck when I'm in the tent?
Stace, you need to calm down.
Don't tell me what I should do.
-Stacy, you know I wouldn't do that. -I heard you, Eric.
-Stacy, you know I wouldn't do that. -I heard you, Eric. -[Amy] We were just talking. I was just... -[Stacy] I heard you moaning, Amy.
-[Amy] We were just talking. I was just... -[Stacy] I heard you moaning, Amy. [Amy] I was crying, Stacy.
What's going on? My boyfriend is fucking your girlfriend!
-That's what's going on. -She's just crazy and irrational.
You think she's never cheated on you? Stacy.
-Fuck you! Fuck you! -[Amy] Fuck you, bitch!
-Fuck you! Fuck you! -[Amy] Fuck you, bitch! All you ever cared about is your fucking self!
-Stacy, stop it. -Don't fucking touch me!
-[Eric] Relax. You're scared. -Fuck you!
She would've slept with Mathias if I hadn't stopped her.
Mathias.
Well, thank God we cut his legs off.
Shut up.
It's eating me like it's eating him.
-Stace. -[Stacy] No. It's inside... It's inside of me.
Stacy.
It's in my side, Amy. It's in my... It's...
I'll show you. It's here. If you just cut here and here...
-[Eric] Stacy. -[Stacy] ...and here.
-[Jeff] Stacy. -[Eric] Stacy, you're okay.
-You're okay. -You're not listening!
-Stacy, you're fine. -You're not listening!
[screaming] You are not listening!
You're not listening to me!
[plants] You're not listening to me! You're not listening to me!
What the fuck?
[plants] You're not listening to me! You're not listening to me!
You're not listening to me! You're not listening to me!
[plants screaming] You're not listening to me!
[Jeff] They don't want us to spread it. That's why they won't let us leave.
They're salting the soil...
to keep it contained.
It's old. It has to be. Really old.
Because the birds, the insects,
somehow they've learned not to land here.
And the horses. Remember? How frightened the horses were?
It didn't happen.
What she said about Mathias.
-I didn't... -You don't have to say anything.
But I do.
-Because I don't want you to... -Amy.
Look at us.
Would it matter to you?
Guys?
Show them.
-Okay. Stace. -I didn't mean to.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -I know.
We're gonna start with the one in your leg. Okay, Stace?
It's okay.
-I'm sorry. -It's okay.
[Jeff] You might wanna close your eyes.
I wanna see. I wanna see it.
-[Stacy gasping] -[Amy] Are you okay?
Through your nose. [Amy] Good. Just keep breathing, keep breathing.
[Amy] Good. Just keep breathing, keep breathing. -[screaming] -[Amy] Keep breathing, keep breathing...
-[screaming] -[Amy] Keep breathing, keep breathing...
-Okay. Okay. -[Jeff] I got it. [Amy] All right, he's almost done.
It's okay.
[Amy] Okay?
[Jeff] Should I stop? Stacy, do you want me to stop?
[crying] No.
[Stacy] I'm scared. No. It's okay. Keep breathing.
-[screaming] -Okay, okay.
[Amy] Okay, okay.
It's almost out. No! Oh, no!
[Stacy] Oh, my God!
[Eric] Okay, it's okay.
[Amy] He got all of it. The shirt up.
-[Jeff] Hold the other one. -[Stacy sobbing]
[Amy] It's okay. I'm here.
-[Amy] Please. -[sobbing]
Stace.
There's more of it. There's more.
Right here. Under... Under the muscle, like by the bone there.
[Jeff] There's nothing there, Stacy.
Yes, can we cut it? There's no more cutting.
I wanna cut it. I wanna cut it.
-I wanna cut it. I wanna... -[Eric] Hey, don't!
Hey! You can't. You can't keep cutting.
-It's just everywhere. It's in my head. -[Eric] No.
-[Eric] It's okay. You're okay. -[Stacy] No, no.
Yeah, you're okay. No, no. I'm not okay. I'm not okay.
You keep saying I'm okay. I'm not okay. Why do you keep saying that to me?
Here, this might help.
[tearful] What? What?
Amy, did you see it? You saw it, didn't you?
You saw it in my head. I felt it.
Amy.
Amy, please tell me.
[Eric] Stacy. Why won't you look at me?
Stacy, Stacy...
-[sniffles] You saw it? -It's okay.
You saw it? Did you see it? No, I... There's nothing there.
[Eric] There's nothing there, okay? I swear.
It's in my head. I feel it, you guys.
[Amy] Let's move her in the tent. [Stacy sobbing] Okay.
No one's coming. I'm going tonight.
[vines mimicking Stacy] I wanna cut it. I wanna cut it.
[vines] I wanna cut it. I wanna cut it. I wanna cut it.
[Eric] Stacy, what are you doing?
Oh, my God!
It's okay. It's okay.
I just... I just have to get this one out.
[Stacy] It's okay.
Just have to get this one. [grunting]
-Stacy? -No. No.
-Stacy, give it to me. -No. No...
Give it to me right now. -No! -[Jeff exclaims]
-[Amy] Jeff? -[groans in pain]
I'm very sorry. I have to get this piece right here...
-Stacy. -...here, in my... -Stacy, give me the knife. Stacy. -[Stacy grunting]
Stacy, give me the knife, okay?
Don't touch me!
Easy, stay down.
Eric! Eric!
[screaming] Eric! [Amy] Oh, my God!
Stay down.
[Stacy] Eric! Eric!
Eric! Amy!
Come here. Come here. [tearful] Amy! Eric! Eric!
[tearful] Amy! Eric! Eric!
[Stacy sobbing] Eric! Amy! Amy!
[crying] Amy, I didn't mean to! I'm sorry!
[sobbing] It hurts.
-It's okay. -I didn't mean to!
Stacy. [Stacy] Eric! Eric! It hurts.
[Amy] Don't move. Don't move.
-[Stacy] Eric? -[Amy hushing]
Eric? Eric? Eric!
-[vines rustling] -[Stacy] Eric? Eric?
No! No.
No! No!
[Stacy screaming] Eric! Eric! Come here. Come here.
[sobbing] Eric! Eric! Eric!
[Amy] Stacy.
[Stacy] Amy. Amy... -[Amy] No. -It hurts.
-No. No. -[Stacy] It hurts.
[softly] Kill me. Amy, kill me.
Amy.
[Stacy] Kill me. Kill me!
-Jeff. -[Stacy] Amy!
-Kill me! Kill me! -It's okay.
Stace.
[Stacy sobbing] You have to, Amy.
Kill me! Amy!
[Stacy] Yes! Kill me! Kill me. Kill me! [Amy sobbing] No!
[vines] Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! [Stacy] Amy.
[vines mimicking Stacy] Kill me! Kill me!
Jeff.
[Stacy] Kill me!
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!
Once you're past the clearing,
you run as fast as you can, okay?
-[Amy whimpers] -Okay?
When you get to the Jeep,
you don't wait for anything. Anything.
And if these don't work, then you run,
and you don't stop until you reach the town.
You promise me that you'll still be here?
Okay.
You don't even know her name.
You don't know any of our names.
I'm Jeff. Jeff Dean MacIntyre.
Winnetka, Illinois.
Twenty-two years old.
I was gonna be a doctor. That was my dream.
That's all I wanted.
You should know her name, too.
-Her name... -[men yelling]
is Amy!
And she is not gonna die on this fucking hill!
[Amy] Jeff!
Come on. Come on. Come on...
-Please. -[men yelling]
Okay.
Okay.
-Thanks for taking us to the movies. -You're welcome, Donna. See you at school tomorrow.
I'll wait for you at cheerleading tryouts.
Yeah, I think I'm gonna skip it this year.
Why?
Well, my mom doesn't think it's such a good idea, you know,
-with all that's happened. -She's probably right.
There's only one spot left on the team, and one of us has to get it
so that Crissy doesn't.
What did that poor girl do to you two to make you hate her so?
Where do you want me to start?
See you tomorrow. Bye.
Bye.
They had an 8 and 2 record in 1941, when they won the Rose Bowl at Duke.
I'm home.
Dad?
Joey?
I almost killed myself on this!
Joey?
Did you hear me, butthole?
Turn the TV down.
Where is she?
Where is she? She's not here!
I swear to God!
Oh, help me, somebody!
Please, don't. She belongs to me.
Where is she?
-I know you know, you're her mother. -No!
Tell me where she is!
She's at a sleepover.
Please, don't.
Help me! Help me! Please, stop! Stop!
Help me!
I did it for us.
No!
And then what happens?
And then I wake up, just like I always did.
Well, like I told you before,
the nightmare is an associate form of reliving the real experience.
It's to be expected.
I know.
I just... They went away for such a long time.
I can't believe they're back.
Donna, it's going to take more than three years.
You're doing amazingly well.
Think of him only as a phantom to you now.
He was caught and put away forever
2,300 miles away.
The only place that he can hurt you is in your dreams.
I just thought they stopped.
Psychological trauma often heightens during times of transition.
And you don't need me to tell you that your life is in transition.
High school is coming to an end, college in the fall.
The uncertainty that comes with being an adult.
The memories of that night will come and go and fade with time,
The memories of that night will come and go and fade with time, but you will never forget it.
Just like you'll never forget tomorrow night.
But hopefully that will be a memory that you'll always want to remember.
So, tell me,
what color is your dress?
It's a champagne color with pink and gold beads and it's corseted,
so it's a little sexy.
Oh, it sounds pretty.
If you want to talk about sexy,
you should see Lisa's dress with that plunging neckline.
Ronnie's gonna love you in it.
Yeah, he's gonna love me even more out of it.
I made sure Ronnie got the biggest limousine he could find.
I can't actually believe that Michael is helping spring for the limo
and a two bedroom suite with Ronnie and Bobby.
It's prom night. That boy's planning on getting laid.
Yeah. In his dreams maybe.
All right, Donna. Have a look.
Oh, it looks good. I like it.
-Donna? -What?
-You okay? -Yeah, I'm okay.
What time did Bobby say to be ready for the limo?
-7:00. -Oh, I'm so excited.
-He's going to be here soon, Donna! -Okay, Aunt Karen!
She's come so far.
Going to her senior prom.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry.
Sorry. No, no, it's okay.
Have you stopped taking your pills?
Yeah, for like a week now.
You know what Dr. Crowe said.
I know, I just...
I don't want to be numb tonight.
I wanna remember everything. Everything that happens.
Besides, you know, it's my prom. I'm supposed to be really anxious, right?
Of course you are.
Gosh, you look so beautiful.
Thanks.
You are gonna have so much fun. This is gonna be a great night.
Oh, my God! He's here.
Don't worry.
Here.
I know she would want you to wear it tonight.
No, no. What if I get something on it?
She would be so proud of you.
Come here.
Thank you.
I'm gonna go downstairs and tell Bobby that you're almost ready.
Okay.
Thanks.
I wouldn't be getting a scholarship or anything, not my first year.
I wouldn't be getting a scholarship or anything, not my first year. But I think if I work really, really hard...
You look beautiful.
Thanks.
You look so good. You clean up very well.
Thank you.
It's so pretty. Yeah. Four hours with the flower lady.
-Did you pick it out yourself? -Kind of.
Did not!
Okay, yeah. Thank you.
-Thank you. -Here, I can do this.
-I'm kidding, I'm kidding. -Oh, my God!
You totally scared me.
-Perfect. -Photo op.
Okay, ready?
-So cheesy. -Okay. One, two, three, four, five.
There we go.
We're trusting you.
-I went to prom once... -Honey, honey. It's okay.
I know, sir. You have nothing to worry about.
You're the most beautiful girl in the world.
-Thanks, Uncle Jack. -Come here.
-I love you guys. -Have a great time, all right?
-Thank you. -Good night.
I cannot wait to get there.
You look awesome!
Let's get to the goddamn prom.
You guys look so pretty!
Well, not the guys, the guys look very handsome.
Wait, now guys get in.
You know Crissy is going all Hollywood with her theme this year
since she's the president of the prom committee.
I heard that she spent $100,000 over budget and her dad had to write a check.
-Stop it! -He's totally pissed!
I wish that was my daddy.
Rich bitch, one word.
-Oh, hyphen. -$100,000?
Come on, more pictures! Pictures!
Next?
Great. Perfect.
-Hey, Winn. -Yeah, that's Detective Winn to you, kid.
This just came in for you.
What?
-Biller here. -This is Detective Winn from Bridgeport PD.
I'm calling about a fax concerning the escape of Richard Fenton.
I'm calling about a fax concerning the escape of Richard Fenton. What the hell is going on?
What the hell is going on? We just received word from the hospital of Fenton's escape on Wednesday evening.
We just received word from the hospital of Fenton's escape on Wednesday evening.
Why'd it take three goddamn days to notify us?
Sorry, sir. I needed to notify the court.
-Damn it, I don't believe this. -What is it?
This is a case I had three years ago. Hey, Jones, get me a car?
Come on.
High school teacher, he got crazy obsessed with a young female student.
They fired him. That didn't stop it.
Then the family got a restraining order against him and he went psycho.
She got home from the movies, he didn't know she was there.
She hid under the bed and had to watch him kill her mother.
Oh, my God.
We arrested that son-of-a-bitch at his house.
We found journals of this guy having fantasies about this girl.
He had pictures of her everywhere.
That was pretty hard for her, too, she had to ID him.
You got something to say, Mr. Fenton?
Nothing can keep us apart.
-That's him. -She needs me now more than ever.
She has no family.
-I see what you're trying to do. -All she has is me.
-Hey, listen to me. -You know we love one another?
-Ask Donna. -Can we go now, please?
Are we almost done here?
Donna makes me feel, and when I touch her...
That's enough! Don't look over there, look at me!
-Can we go now, please? -We'll be together forever.
You're gonna be in jail! We'll be together forever. That's my promise.
We'll be together forever. That's my promise.
We'll be together forever. That's my promise. That's enough. We're going.
All right, you're going to jail.
I'll see you soon, Donna.
We matched DNA, his prints were everywhere,
so her IDing him sealed the deal.
As far as we were concerned, he was going to die. Definitely.
The jury didn't think so. No, they came back with insanity.
He's been in a maximum security prison for the criminally insane
up until three days ago.
What happened to the girl?
Well, she's got an aunt and uncle that live here. They took her in.
After the trial, things settled down a little bit,
-until she started getting the letters. -Letters?
Yeah, and some sick shit, too. Hang tight, kid.
I'm gonna go tell the aunt and uncle. This is gonna rock their world.
-Oh, we're turning in! We're here! -Are we here? Yeah!
Holy crap!
We're here!
Talk about Hollywood.
You look lovely.
Nice try, Mr. Nichols. Bad boy.
Oh, God!
May I help you, sir?
Donna Keppel, you look incredible. And Claire, you, too.
And Lisa, wow!
That dress, it's so...
Inappropriate?
Crissy! Wow, your dress... It's so simple.
It's so you.
Girls.
Gentlemen?
Crissy, come on, this is prom.
Okay, let's just all be nice, and just forget about the past.
As fellow prom queen nominee, I want to wish you luck tonight.
You're gonna need all you can get.
Oh, you think you got it all wrapped up, do you?
Well, they're certainly not propped up and on parade like yours are,
that's for sure.
-You know what, I'm so sick... -Baby, baby, she's not even worth it.
Look, you're gonna be queen, I'm gonna be your king, all right?
Look, I'm gonna go get the keys right quick. I'll be back.
-Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm okay.
Lisa, you really do look beautiful. I just know you're gonna win.
Well, thanks, Ms. Waters.
-Have fun. -Bye.
I know who she voted for.
-She is so in love with you. -Shut up.
Bridgeport High, huh?
Come on, now. What's up, everybody, and welcome to the prom of all proms!
-Oh, my God! Look at this place! -Hey, look at me on the big screen.
Bridgeport High, make some noise!
Yeah!
My name is DJ Tyler. I'm gonna be hosting the events tonight.
This has to be the greatest prom on Earth.
Brought to you also by Crissy Lynn. I see you over there, girl. Yeah!
Congratulations Bridgeport High, to all 206 of you graduates.
It's time to get the party started! Get out there and get your party pumping!
Now, it's time for a little Consequence.
I mean, you gotta hand it to Crissy, though. This is amazing!
Wait, does this mean we can't make fun of her anymore?
Nah!
And just so you know, our fitness center will be closed
because of the renovations being done on the mezzanine level.
Thank you, Mr. Ramsey. If I can just get your autograph.
Can I get three keys to suite 312? I have it reserved under Ronnie Heflin.
One moment.
All right. There you are, Mr. Heflin.
Thank you.
Do you have a preference as to which floor, Mr. Ramsey?
Third floor would be great.
You really outdid yourself, Crissy. I mean, we really appreciate it.
Thanks. I wanted it to look just like an L.A. club.
I mean, nobody can believe it, right?
-One for you. -Thank you.
One for you.
-And one for... -We're going up to the room to freshen up.
Why, baby? You look great.
That's correct! You're doing very well tonight.
But I'll look even better when I get back.
Well, let's go get a table, before they're all gone.
Oh, hold that door.
Thank you.
Oh, man.
So...
Which one of you beautiful young women is my date tonight?
So, we're gonna take this party upstairs, ladies. Room 604.
Yeah, we'll... Be right up.
Lisa!
-604. -Right. Got it.
Come on.
-I'm gonna hold you to that. -Sixth floor.
Excuse me. What's his problem?
Oh, my God. The one on the end looked like my dad. I swear.
Kind of, yeah!
That one guy was kind of cute.
-No! -No!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, you guys!
Come here, come here, come here!
Excuse me?
My card, it doesn't seem to work. Can you help?
Here's your problem, it's got a scratch.
Call the front desk, and someone will bring you a replacement card.
Thank you very much.
One more thing.
Can I have some extra towels?
Sure.
Jack? Detective Winn.
-Is she here? -No, no, she's not.
-She's at her senior prom, why? -Jack, I gotta talk to you.
Come outside.
What's going on?
Jack, it's Richard Fenton. He escaped from jail three days ago.
He's at large.
How could it take so long for us to be notified?
Jack, I think we should bring Donna home, just to be safe.
I can't take a chance. I gotta put a unit on your house, you know that.
All right? And I'm gonna put backup on the hotel.
No.
Thank you.
For what?
For tonight.
For everything.
Well, you're welcome.
I am pretty awesome.
-At prom, you're gonna talk about this? -I don't understand...
Hey, what's going on with Claire and Michael?
Oh, same ol', same ol'.
He's freaking out because she's going away to college. You know.
Babe, they'll be fine.
-I gotta talk to you. -Okay. I'll be right back.
-What's going on? -Michael. He's making me so damn mad.
And on top of that, I have killer cramps.
Don't let a stupid argument ruin your prom night, okay?
And I have Midol up in my purse. I'll go get it for you.
Thank you.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I need the key to the suite. I gotta go get something for Claire.
-I'll just go with you. -Oh, no, no. It's okay.
Thank you.
Patrol car just pulled up.
I don't understand how you could not bring her home with that maniac on the loose.
And Detective Winn, he said he wanted to bring her home, you said that...
I know, I know, I know.
But he also said that there's no reason to believe that Fenton's headed this way.
And, honey, if we show up at her prom, in front of all her friends,
what's that gonna do to all the progress that she's made over the past three years?
Do you remember how many nights she woke up screaming?
I just don't ever want that little girl to go through that again, do you?
No, of course I don't.
-But I'm so scared. -I know, I know.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Claire?
Bobby?
Is that you?
-Oh, my God. -Sorry.
You scared the hell out of me!
Are you okay?
No.
What happened?
Michael thinks I'm going away to school just so I can date other guys.
He just went ballistic because he saw me talking to Rick. He's impossible.
I'm sorry. Here, take these, it'll make you feel better.
Thanks.
Do you want me to hang out with you, until you want to go back downstairs?
No. I'm just gonna fix my face, then I'll come back down. Thanks.
How are you doing?
I'm good.
-You look beautiful. -You look beautiful.
Okay, I'll go request some J.T., we'll dance, we'll have fun.
See you down there.
Donna?
Michael?
Michael? What are you...
-Nash. -I'm at Pacific Grand. Our girl's got the senior prom tonight.
Our girl's got the senior prom tonight.
I want you to get Hicks, Stryker, Ansen, and Grant, get them in plain clothes,
get them over here ASAP. Why, is something wrong?
No, and that's exactly how I want to keep it.
By some chance this bastard decides to come here, we're gonna be ready for him.
You got it.
Hey. Detective Winn, Bridgeport PD. How are you?
Doing fine, thanks.
Have you seen this man tonight?
No. Who is this guy, anyway?
Oh, he's just someone I'm looking for.
He dangerous?
Do me a favor, why don't you make copies of that, give it to your staff.
-Let me know if anyone sees him. -Will do.
You got exits here. How many exits you got?
-Two outside fire stairwells. -Let me see that. Yep.
There's the loading dock in the back.
Stairwell from the basement.
Three fire exits lit up on the ground floor, in the main entrance.
-Can I keep this? -It's all yours.
Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Should I be concerned?
No.
All right, folks. You looking real good out there tonight.
But what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna slow it down just a little bit,
because I don't want you to sweat out your good clothes.
On your way to the dance floor, though, fellas, grab your girl
and thank your man Ronnie out there.
Ronnie Heflin is sending this song out to his girl, Lisa Hines.
So, we gonna get that busy right now. Here you go, folks.
You wanna dance?
What's going on?
I'm thinking about going to State with you next year.
Why?
I don't know.
I guess I just don't think I'm ready to be so far away from home.
If we were at State together, then we'd get to see each other all the time.
I mean, if you wanted to.
No, I would love that.
I mean, I would. I mean, you know I would. It would be amazing.
But?
But nothing, Donna.
You got into Brown with a full scholarship.
I mean, you don't just throw that away for anything, or anybody.
It's not that I don't want to be near you next year.
It's just that...
That would be really selfish of me.
And I'd always know in the back of my head that I was the reason
that you didn't get a big-time Ivy League shot at the world, you know?
But what if this long distance thing doesn't work out?
I mean, look what's happening with Michael and Claire.
And Claire's gonna be only a two hour drive away from him next year.
Claire and Michael are not you and me.
Not even close.
Right?
What is it?
I'm scared.
It just feels like
everything's falling apart.
And I'm scared of losing you.
I'm scared that somebody else is gonna come along
and find out how amazing you are.
If this is real, it'll last.
I think we've been through some pretty rough times already, don't you think?
-Yeah. -Donna, you gotta stop being scared, okay?
Because there's nothing left to be scared of.
I promise.
Hey, you guys seen Claire lately?
Yeah. She's up in the suite.
What the hell is she doing up there?
You pissed her off, Michael. She's been crying her eyes out.
You can't keep doing this to her. You're gonna lose her.
Yeah, I doubt that.
Claire and Michael, exhibit A. Nothing like us.
-I love you. -I love you, too.
Claire?
Claire?
Are you here?
Are you in there?
Come on, babe. Look, I don't want to fight anymore, okay?
Honestly, I promise. I'm gonna stop bugging you about going away and all.
I'm just gonna deal with it, okay? I swear to God.
Claire, please, don't do this.
All right. Fine.
I'm just gonna sit out here. I'm just gonna wait for you to come out.
I don't care how long it takes. I got all damn night.
All right.
Claire,
what do you want me to say?
You want me to say that I'm sorry?
Okay. Okay, I'm sorry.
Claire, look, I really am sorry, Claire.
Look, don't let my being an idiot ruin our prom, okay?
Okay? Claire?
All right, where'd you go?
Claire?
Gotcha!
But I already said I was sorry. What else do you want me to say, huh?
This is getting silly. Enough already.
Claire?
Hey, what's up?
I did not know you partied like that here at Bridgeport!
Man, you done wore me out up here!
I tell you what though, I'm gonna take me a little fifteen-minute break.
But while I'm gone, the AV department put together a nice little yearbook for you, so enjoy that.
the AV department put together a nice little yearbook for you, so enjoy that.
And when I come back, this year's prom king and prom queen, all right?
See you in a minute.
Hey, let's go upstairs.
They're gonna announce king and queen.
DJ's taking a break, and then he's gonna come back and play a couple other songs.
DJ's taking a break, and then he's gonna come back and play a couple other songs. You don't care about this at all, do you?
What's to care about?
What if Ronnie wins king instead of you?
What if he does?
He's her boyfriend. I have to be crowned with her boyfriend?
Look, Ronnie's the starting quarterback. All-city two years in a row.
Yeah, Crissy, you could do a lot worse.
Besides, maybe you won't even win.
All right, look, I'm gonna go upstairs, just call me when it's time, okay?
If he were any dumber I'd have to water him.
I wanna make a toast
to my little queen.
No matter what happens.
Cheers.
If that bitch wins, I swear
I'll hurl.
Okay, I'm sorry, but just explain to me why do you care so much?
Because what do you get?
Because what do you get? You get like a bouquet of roses and a tacky tiara you can only wear at proms.
It's not about what you get. It's, like, about the honor, you know?
It's about the respect of my peers.
-What? -Your peers?
-That's the geekiest thing you've ever said. -Okay, I guess it was a little geeky.
But seriously, I just want Crissy to know that she can't buy everything.
And think about the reunions to come.
If I win, it'll eat away at her till the day she dies.
That's awful.
You're so sexy when you're mean and vindictive.
All right.
How's it going?
Yeah, well, so far so good. Anything your end?
No.
Which one is she?
She's the blonde, at the back table.
She's pretty.
And alive. And I want her to stay that way.
Guys.
This is it.
This is all ending, this time of our lives.
You know everyone always says that prom is supposed to be this amazing time
that everyone looks forward to since the beginning of freshman year.
But no one ever tells you
it's really sad, you know?
Because some of us are never gonna see each other again.
-Except for us! -Oh, thank you.
We'll see each other all the time.
Well, I don't know about any of them, but...
I'm sure gonna miss you guys.
Ronnie, I'm gonna be 100 miles away. I'm not going too far.
And I'll be home on the holidays.
And Claire's only gonna be two hours away.
-Where is Claire? -Oh, yeah.
-Where's Michael? -Maybe they're still in the suite.
Where we should be. All right, stop.
You know what, we're gonna give you guys some space.
-Yeah, we'll be right back. -I think that's a good idea.
Come on, Maria. Where are you? Maria?
Are you there?
Hello?
Hey, Simms, come here.
Have you seen Maria? 412 needs a turn down
and I'm trying to get her on her walkie, but she doesn't answer.
I've got this for 304. I'll check and see if she's there.
All right, thanks.
-Great, thanks. -Thank you.
Evening, sir.
Maria?
Excuse me, sir?
Yes.
Did you happen to see the housekeeper up here?
She's right here in my room.
Turning down the bed.
Thank you.
Maria?
Hey, yo, Bobby, let me talk to you for a sec.
Me and Lisa are gonna head up to the suite,
see what's taking Michael and Claire so long. All right?
Right. Just make it quick, all right?
Five minutes, max.
Is that all?
Very funny.
If you do see Michael and Claire, tell them to get their butts down here.
Will do. Bye.
Where are they going?
Upstairs to the suite for a little alone time.
I'm not sleeping in that bed.
-I'm having a great time. -Me, too.
I'm sorry.
Gotcha.
Look, come on, baby.
-Lisa? -Yeah.
That guy, he looks so familiar.
His eyes.
Baby, your eyes are so...
-Where is it? -The very back of the hotel's parking lot.
Come on, we ain't got a lot of time.
I swear that I know that guy from somewhere.
Look, know him or want to get to know him?
Don't be stupid.
Did you see how he looked at me? I mean, his eyes were so...
God, I swear I've seen him some place before.
Why don't you stop thinking about him, right?
Think about me, okay?
There you go, Bridgeport. That's how you do a prom, everybody.
You need to come to the parking lot. I think we got something.
All right, I'm gonna have to ask you to move on out the way.
Clear the dance floor, because this is the end of my time right now.
It's time for me to bring to the stage,
the prettiest P.E. teacher I've ever met in my whole life.
Ms. Waters, everybody, because she's about to announce
this year's prom king and prom queen. Here we go!
Okay. Oh, sorry, sorry.
Let's give it up for DJ Tyler for giving us an awesome prom.
All righty. Now, I have in my hot little hand here
Bridgeport High School's prom king and prom queen.
Will the nominees please join me here up on stage?
For prom queen I have, Crissy Lynn, Lisa Hines...
-They gotta get down here. -I know, I know.
...Michelle Evaretti, and Katie Higgins.
Come on up, girls!
-What's goin' on? You've reached Ronnie. -Straight to voicemail.
Try him on the house phone.
All righty, and prom king is Rick Leland,
Ronnie Heflin, Michael Kelley, and Dennis Long.
A woman over in Woodburn filed a missing persons on her husband.
She said that he would take the train to work every day in Portland,
but he would always leave his car at the station.
But he didn't come home last night.
Open it up.
No wallet, no ID, no credit card, no money.
And the car was registered to a Howard K. Ramsey, our missing person.
What about these decorations, everybody? The prom committee, sensational job.
You're so beautiful.
Jesus Christ!
-Of course! It's him, it's him! -Look, enough already.
No, I gotta get to Donna!
I don't believe this.
Come on!
Damn it!
-Why the rush? -Oh, God!
It must be off the hook. They're not answering the room either.
Well, you better go up and try to find them. I'm sorry. Be fast!
Lisa?
Lisa?
-Ronnie Heflin, Lisa Hines. -Oh, here's Ronnie! Here's Ronnie.
Hey, where's Lisa?
I don't know. She said she came down here to tell you that...
Oh, maybe she's in the bathroom. Okay, you get up on stage. Go, go.
-Ronnie, please. -Sorry. I'm right here.
Give me the key to the suite. I'm gonna go try to find her in the bathroom.
If she's not there, I'll go check upstairs.
Where the hell is she?
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
Has anyone seen Lisa Hines?
Excuse me, sir. Howard K. Ramsey, is he registered here? Ramsey.
Yes, sir. Room 309.
Okay, here's what we're doing. You stay here by the front door.
You tell the guys at the exits what's happening,
-and get me some backup, okay? -You got it.
Give me a room key to room 309.
Mr. Ramsey.
Ah, damn it.
No. No, he's here. He's killed a maid.
Cover all the doors. I'm gonna pull the alarm.
I want the entire place cleared immediately! We'll flush him out.
Find Donna Keppel and put her in protective custody now! Nash, now!
Find Donna Keppel and put her in protective custody now! Nash, now! All right. You got it. Stryker, watch the door.
All right. You got it. Stryker, watch the door.
All right, we're gonna have to start without her.
Bridgeport High's prom king and prom queen are...
Alert! Please exit the building. This is an emergency.
-Please, stay calm. Quiet, please. -Everyone, please, quiet down!
I'm Detective Nash with the Bridgeport Police Department.
I am going to need you to exit the hotel through the lobby.
Now, there's no reason to panic. The Fire Department will be here shortly.
They were just about to crown king and queen!
People! I'm not kidding, here! Please, let's move, now!
This will have to wait, all right?
-The hell it will! -Crissy!
Shit!
Oh, my God! You have to be kidding me!
Lisa?
Alert! Please exit the building. This is an emergency.
Keep it moving, people.
Crissy, what's going on? Where's everyone going?
-Hey, Rick? What's going on? -I don't know, but we gotta go outside.
I forgot my mom's shawl upstairs.
If you see Bobby can you tell him I'll meet him outside?
Thanks.
Alert! Please exit the building. This is an emergency.
If there is a Donna Keppel here,
will you please come to the front of the stage?
Excuse me. Why are you looking for Donna?
Excuse me. Why are you looking for Donna? Why? Do you know where she is?
-She went looking for my girl. -Where?
Women's restroom and then up to the third floor. Why?
Hey, what's the problem?
Your attention, please. Keep this area clear for emergency vehicles.
Stay on the sidewalk.
Alert! Please exit the building. This is an emergency.
Lisa?
Claire?
Hello?
Oh, I've missed you.
There isn't a moment where I haven't thought about you, Donna.
Please, don't do this.
Don't be afraid.
Donna!
Get out!
No!
No!
Donna, open up.
Open up!
Donna!
No!
No!
Leave me alone!
Ansen, Grant, I need these people back! Push them 50 yards back!
Get them back here, put it right there. Come on! Let's go!
You gotta be all the way back to the sidewalk, all right?
-Winn. -Where is she?
I don't know. They got separated.
-He said she went to go look for her friend. -What the hell is going on?
Why won't anybody tell me why you're looking for Donna?
Hey, man. She went back up to your suite to get something.
Move, move, move!
She told me to tell you just to wait here. She'd come back down.
You couldn't tell me sooner, Rick?
Did you see Lisa?
No.
Donna?
Donna, stop!
He's in there, he's in there, he's in there, he's in there!
Claire's under the bed and she's dead! She's dead!
-Get her out of here, Nash. -You have to help me, please.
Hey! Donna! Donna!
Bobby. Bobby. Oh, my God! Bobby!
-Yeah, come on. Here. You okay? -Donna, get in the car. Please.
-I'm going with her. -Okay, get in the car.
Can he come with me?
-Don't leave me. Don't leave me. -I won't. I'm coming, I'm coming, baby.
-Look, what's happening? -Hold on.
I talked to your aunt and uncle. They know what's going on, okay?
-I'm gonna take you home, all right? -Look, did you see Lisa?
Claire's dead.
What'd you say?
Bobby! Wait!
Wait!
Clear a lane here, please!
Yeah.
He's somewhere in this hotel, because all the exit points are covered.
We're gonna tear this place apart,
room by room, floor by floor, until we get him.
How's the girl doing?
Yeah, she's safe. And her boyfriend's with us, too.
Keep that house completely covered until I find this guy.
Yeah, no problem.
My girlfriend is missing, and I need to know what the hell is going on!
My girlfriend is missing, and I need to know what the hell is going on! I'm sure she's out here somewhere, all right? Just take a look for her.
I'm sure she's out here somewhere, all right? Just take a look for her.
Okay, let's go!
We'll find her.
Here it is. We have three dead. One maid, two kids, okay?
We've had all the exits covered all night, so there's no way he got out.
I want to start on the ground floor, and work our way up.
The hotel already knows what's going on, so let's get to work. Come on, let's go!
Hey, Hicks, do me a favor, get all those people to go home. Everybody.
Consider it done.
Hey, is everybody out?
-Yes, sir. -I think so.
Lisa?
Donna!
Oh, my God! Oh, thank God you're safe!
-It's all happening again. -It's okay.
-Bobby, you okay? -Yes, sir, I am.
I called my parents and I told them what was happening.
-I'd like to stay with Donna tonight. -Absolutely, absolutely.
Come on inside.
Mr. Turner, please.
-I'm Detective Nash. -Hey, how are you?
How many entrances are on the house?
There's the front and the back, what?
Tell me you've caught this animal.
-I can't find Lisa! -We are looking for her.
I've got some missing students inside. I want to know what you're doing about it.
I've got some missing students inside. I want to know what you're doing about it. We are doing the best we can. Please, be patient.
Copy that. We're finishing fourth floor, north exposure.
Someone said that Claire was murdered, and Michael and Lisa are missing.
-We all clear? -We're all clear.
Let's close it up.
Over here.
Jesus.
...faculty, staff, and guests, to evacuate onto the streets.
The news conference, I'm sure, will be forthcoming, and we will be here live
to give you the updates as they come in. But to recap,
a night that was supposed to be one of the greatest nights in a student's life
may have ended tragically in the historic Pacific Grand Hotel.
What's going on, Detective?
This is an active crime scene investigation.
If we have any more information to share, you will be the first to know.
Is it true that a student was murdered?
And that other students at the prom are missing?
-Can you give us anything? -Detective?
The SWAT teams are engaged at the hotel. Guests were evacuated and cleared.
Look, we're just down the hall if you need anything.
What are you doing?
Checking to see if there's any news on what happened.
Three students may have been injured or killed in this historic hotel.
They're dead.
They're dead, Bobby. They're dead.
-No, you still don't know that. -Michael, Lisa and Claire, they're all dead.
He killed them.
They're dead because he was trying to get to me.
No, Donna. This is not your fault, okay?
This is not you, okay? This is him.
This is him, and they're gonna catch him, okay? I promise.
How?
How can you promise me that?
I'm sorry.
Okay. Okay, come on.
Listen to me, I'm gonna be here, okay?
I'm gonna be here watching over you, okay?
Sorry, two, sir, is right here. Girl.
We got a positive ID from Ronnie Heflin.
His girlfriend was the female victim we found up on the construction level.
-How's the kid doing? -Not so good.
That's it. We turned the place upside down, no sign of him anywhere.
What do you wanna do about the press? They're getting kind of antsy.
I don't know.
I don't know.
What is that?
What the hell is that?
Get me a ladder. Get me a ladder!
Let's move this bed.
Come on, come on, put it right here. Who's got a flashlight?
Jesus!
-Oh, my God. -It's Simms!
-Hey, is everybody out? -I think so.
Damn it. He walked right by me. Move, move!
-Hey, has anybody talked to Nash? -10 minutes ago. Everything was cool.
-Nash. -Hey, Fenton's out. He's not at the hotel.
Copy that. We're on it.
What's the status with the family?
They all went upstairs about an hour and a half ago.
There's a light on in Donna's bedroom.
All right. I'm gonna call and let them know what's happening.
-Copy? -Yeah, you got it.
She's not supposed to be with somebody else, she's supposed to be with me.
There was even the song on the radio.
-Donna? -Oh, my gosh!
You scared me.
-You okay? -Yeah.
-I thought you were sleeping. -No.
No, I was just resting my eyes.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
It's not like you hear the song Mandy on the radio every day.
I haven't heard that song in ten years.
What?
The number you have reached is not in service at this time. This is a recording.
Were you sleeping?
No. I was just resting my eyes, okay?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
It's not like you hear the song Mandy on the radio every day.
I haven't heard that song in like ten years.
The number you have reached is not in service at this time. This is a recording.
No, it can't be. It can't be.
I can't get through. Something weird's going on with the phone.
Get in there and check it out!
-Everything is secure, sir. -Get in there and check it out right now!
I'll be there in five minutes.
Nash! I told you to get up in there and call me!
Nash?
Thank you for staying.
Bobby?
Donna?
Be quiet, or they'll find us.
Oh, my God!
One of your guys is down in the backyard.
It's okay. It's okay.
Are you ready to go with me?
No!
Help!
Call me an ambulance. I've got officers down, I need backup, now, now!
Where is she?
-Let me go! -Stop! Stop!
-Get off me! -Donna!
No!
Bobby?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.
Come on, sweetheart. It's okay. It's okay.

Hey!
Fuck it. What are you trying to do to me, eh?
I've got Jessell's money.
The problem is, it's tied up in these cars,
and you wankers want to trash the lot of them.
Mr. Jessell doesn't care about your inventory.
Mr. Jessell wants to know when he's getting paid.
Any day, I swear, Perky.
Oh… What did you call me? I called you Perky, Perky.
Everyone calls you Perky and him Pinky.
-Pinky and Perky? -Yeah.
They're fucking cartoon pigs on the telly.
What, people call us that behind our backs?
Well, they're not gonna say it to your face, are they?
Well, you just bloody did.
Yeah. Well, you got me riled.
You're very intimidating.
Don't make us come back again.
Not every customer is a satisfied customer.
What are you doing round here, Martine?
-What are you doing tonight? -Tonight?
Tonight is Eddie's stag do. Taking him out for a drink. Why?
Taking him out for a drink. Why? I've got a proposition for you, Terry.
A proposition?
Can you meet me at the Players Club before you see the boys,

Make it 9:00.
Ah, morning, Gale. Morning, Tim.

Don't know what you're talking about.

The Black Robin Hood of Notting Hill.
The richer, whiter, and more famous, the more they fawn over him.
The truth is, he's a slum landlord, a drug dealer,
and a vicious pimp who should've been in prison years ago.
[Michael] Are you not charging outrageous rents
to my brothers and sisters, Mr. Brown?
I'm charging the same as your slumlord friend Lew Vogel.
Ten quid a week is too much for these shit holes.
You know, I always wanted to meet a white man

You know what this is?
It is a slave collar, and the white man

Can I bend you to my will, Mr. Brown? Aah! Aah! Agh!
He's your faithful dog now, Michael.
Michael, I don't think we should get our hopes up here.
Kidnapping, extortion,
assault on this man Brown here,
as well as your previous problems with the law--
I mean, you could be looking at ten to 20 years for this.
I don't think so. I am smarter and better protected than whitey thinks.
I am smarter and better protected than whitey thinks.
[man] All rise.
[man] Seems Michael X has managed to keep himself out of jail
by threatening to release damning photographs
of a certain royal personage.
Until we get our hands on these snaps, the police can't move.
The public prosecutor won't move,
and the home office doesn't want to know.
Has anyone actually seen these photographs?
Yes, but at the moment,
I'm not at liberty to say who that person is.
We've had Michael X under surveillance for quite a while. He keeps a safe deposit box at the Lloyds Bank in Marylebone.
He keeps a safe deposit box at the Lloyds Bank in Marylebone.
We believe that's where the photos are located.
Well, seems straightforward enough.
I'll send a team into this bank
and take whatever he's got in the safe deposit box.
That would have to be sanctioned at the highest level,
-and that's not going to happen. -Ah.
Do you see our problem?
There can be no connection to 506.
So, you want me to come up with something
that avoids any accountability for anyone.
We'd welcome suggestions, Tim.
And if it all goes pear-shaped,
I assume it's my ass on the line.
You're young and ambitious, Tim.
Chance to make a name for yourself.
Thank you, sir.

Excuse me there, miss. Can I have a word? -Yes. -Where have you been?
-Yes. -Where have you been? Morocco.
I'll have to check your underwear.
-Be my guest. -[knocks on door]
We found what we were looking for. Found what? What were you looking for?
Found what? What were you looking for?
Oh, Tim. Thank God. I'm in a spot of bother.
[Martine] What have you been up to? [Terry] Nothing much. You?
I was in Morocco recently.
Business or pleasure? Bit of both. Drinks are on me.
Bit of both. Drinks are on me.
So, we gonna sit here all night making small talk?
I know you, Terry,
and I know your mates.
You've always been looking for the big score,
the one that makes sense of everything.
I have it for you.
-What? -A bank.
A bank? As in rob?
How would you know about a bank?
I've been seeing this guy, runs his own business-- Security systems.
runs his own business-- Security systems.
Next month, they're installing new alarms in a bank in Marylebone.
Seems like the trains have been setting off
the tremor alarms in the vault and they've had to turn them off,
so for a week or so, they won't have any.
Now, why would he tell you all this?
We were having a laugh about it.
"Imagine if half the villains in London knew about this," He said, and I thought,
knew about this," He said, and I thought, "I know half the villains in London.
I grew up with some of them."
Look. Me and my mates have been involved
with the odd bit of skullduggery,
but can you see us tooled up, taking on a bank like the James gang?
This isn't about waving a water pistol at a cashier's head.
This is about getting into the basement where the deposit boxes are,
hidden, secret wealth-- money and jewels
that are safe to steal because people won't report it.
Oh, no, no, no. We can't talk about this here.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Terry.
We can't pass it up.
Didn't expect this from you tonight, Martine.
What did you expect, eh?
I'll have to think about it.
Better get off to your stag party.
Thanks for the drink.
Eddie tells me his brother invited you to the wedding.
You going? I'll see you there.
Can I get a Campari and soda, no ice? Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Well, Tim, sweetie, what do you think?
-Is he up for it? -Maybe.
Cheers, gorgeous.
So, you coming in?
I don't know. It's late.
Do you need to run home like a good, little boy?
I guess I've got time.
What, exactly, do you do?
Bit of this, bit of that.
How did you and Hakim meet?
I met Hakim in Los Angeles last spring.
He was raising money for a Black Montessori school
and writing his life story.
[Michael]  And what an extraordinary life it has been.
The book is called "From the Dead Level: Malcolm X and Me."
I read the manuscript. Hakim is a poet, the voice of the Black soul.

Hakim, tell us more about your book.
It's about being born Black in America.
Can any of you imagine what it is like to be born a Black man in this world?
Can any of you white women imagine what it would be like
to bring a Black baby into this world?

Why are we even having this conversation?
We're not--
Here's your beer.
We are not bank robbers.
Maybe that's why we could get away with it.
It's a bit daunting, isn't it?
You know what scares me more?
Living in Dar with nothing to show for it.
Do you know how old Mozart was was he composed his first minuet?
-No. -Five.
Five. A fucking minuet.
How would you know that fact, Terry?
Because it's tattooed on that stripper's ass, Kevin.
What the fuck's it matter how I know?
It's a fact, and you're missing the point, Kev.
What I'm trying to say is, it's time we stop fucking about
and stop picking the shit from under our fingernails.

-Because even Sonia's can be raided. -Yeah. You'd do that, wouldn't you?
You kill the goose that lays your golden egg.
Well, that would be dumb, wouldn't it?
But then again, everyone knows coppers are dumb.
Oh, well, you can do one thing for me.
You can stop your colleagues
from having their boys' night out in my clubs.
They're loud, they're lewd…
And they expect free oral sex.
You know what? That's disgusting.
You know what? That's disgusting. Why, most of them have families.
We'll pass the word along.
Lew, you tell your greedy, little bobbies
to go and find their perks elsewhere.
No one is gonna bother me.
My patrons could have the lot of these bad coppers put out to pasture.
Well, I say spread the wealth around and keep the peace.

What you doing these days, Dave?
Me? Oh, a bit of film work.
Extra, you know?
And you, Kevin, you're still snapping, I see.
-The wedding photos? -No, no. It's just a favor for the family.
Fashion is my game, fashion and passports.
And the odd snap of a wayward husband.
[Kevin] Thank you, Dave. So, what's the verdict, boys?
We're interested.
First thing we should do is take a look at the place,
suss it out, maybe open a box of our own.
I've already done that. We can go and have a look tomorrow.
Tomorrow, it is.
[Dave] Heads up, lads. All right?
Oh, she's adorable, your little one. She's off.
What a gorgeous flower girl your eldest made.
Thanks. Katherine.
I do envy you.
-Kev, do you want to dance? -Yeah. Come on.
It was lovely to see you all.
-Ciao. -Ciao. -All right, Wend. -All right.
-All right, Wend. -All right.
She envies me. She being sarcastic?
Suppose what she meant was, money can't buy what we have.
Didn't you used to go out with her?
No, love. That was Kevin.
He had this big thing for her.
Oh, and you didn't? No, not like me and you, love at first sight.
No, not like me and you, love at first sight. Oh, yeah.
I remember that night. You was with your mate Audrey at that disco.
Saw this gorgeous, little bum in a pencil skirt.
Thought, "I've got to have that."
But Audrey, she already had a bloke, so I called you.
Cheeky sod. Daddy, come and dance with me.

Good morning.
I'd like to access my safe deposit box, please--
Martine love, L-O-V-E.
Certainly, madam.
[Lew] Taxi!
-You're an actor, right? -That's right.
I did a couple of films for you, Mr. Vogel.
Yeah, right.
So, what were these films you were in?
-Oh, forget about it. -Go on.
Technically, it's what you call pornography.
-You're joking. -No.
So, you've been going around town with a 12-inch mutton dagger
hanging down your pants?
That's nothing to be ashamed of.
Nice.
Fake. Got a posh party at the weekend.
This is the one. The lease is available.
Finally. How do I look? Good?
Finally. How do I look? Good? Not your best, Dave.
[Martine] Here we go.
So how come you got the inside dope on this place, Martine?
She knows this bloke. Runs a security company.
Bloke? Is it serious? You getting married?
He is married. All the best ones are.
Here we go. Marylebone Road and Baker Street.
On the corner here is the bank.
Next door is the Chicken Inn, and at 189, Le Sac.
In the back here is an underground car park
with direct access to the shops' basements.
We can pull in here from Glentworth Street
into the car park for drop-offs and pickups
without being seen from the street.
We'll dig a tunnel from the basement of the shop
under the Chicken inn and pop up in the safe deposit vault.
I got a question.
What do us lot know about digging tunnels?
Nothing, but I know a man who does.
So, what do you reckon, Bambas?
What do I reckon?
I reckon I know you guys,
but I don't know her.
Don't worry about Martine. She's solid.
We go way back.
Terry, you have been up to some mischief in your time,
but this-- this is serious shit, my friend.
Don't you think it's a little out of your league?
Maybe it's time we stepped up to the first division.
There's going to be reinforce concrete under the vault.
We're going to need a thermic lance, a jackhammer,
a generator, lights, ropes, cables-- The works.
It's about 40 feet of digging before we're under the bank.
We could hire some micks from Camden Tower to do the digging.
That's brilliant, Dave.
Why don't we just pay their national insurance contributions,
and then you won't have to get dirt on your Tommy Nutter suit.
This way, Michael. One more shot. This way.
Thank you. That's great.
What are your plans?
I am returning to Trinidad
to liberate my brothers and sisters
from the enslavement of the British colonialists.
What about the charges you are facing?
How can you leave England? They are liars and cowards.
If they had anything against me but their fear of me,
I'd be tried and jailed.
See you tonight. [Martine] We're going to need a front man on this,
someone who can sign the lease on the shop and look for business.

I'll be right back, sir.
What on Earth are you doing here?
Got a bit of business for you, Guy.

Taking the "E" for a test drive.
Tell your boss he can have his inventory back when he settles Mr. Jessell's debt,

Lovely. Cheers.

So come on, then. What don't I know?
Romantic dinner on a Monday night?
Look, honey, uh…
I'm gonna be working some strange hours over the next week or two, so…
Don't ask me what I'm doing, because I don't want to lie to you.
What are you doing?
Look, I know I've caused us a few problems
with those cars that aren't selling.
All I was trying to do was get out of the game.
This thing is gonna put us there. Will it?
Yeah. In a better place.
It's for all of us,
for you and the kids.
And how afraid do I have to be, Terry?
Maybe it would be a smart thing if you went and stayed with your aunt,
in case things turn to custard.
So we are settled. Twenty-five percent to run my girls till I return from Trinidad.
It's all right. You don't have to worry.
I'll look after your little flock of birds like they were my own.
So long as you remember they are not your own.
Lew, while I'm back in Trinidad, I can arrange for a shipment of some high grade ganja.

You should think about it.
With these goodies, you could make a lot of dough,
especially with the police in your pocket.
I'm paying enough bung as it is,
but probably not as much as you're donating
to be permitted to leave our fair shores.
Not a shilling. I have something so special,
I don't need to pay anyone.
And what would that be, Michael?
Sorry, Lew.
Well, whatever it is, you crafty bugger,

What's this for? That is the thermic lance.
It cuts through concrete and metal.
We're doing this, hey? I mean, we're bloody going for it.
Let's see what this thing can do. Good idea, Kev.
Give us a demonstration, Bambas.
Ok. Hold this. Hold it. Here.
Kevin, go stand over there by the oxygen.
Here we go.
Shut it off!
Off! Off! Off!
Knock off!

What's the worst-case scenario?
They get caught and go to jail. No possible connection to us.
What about this model you're screwing?

Right.
I wonder how they talked their way out of that one.
Tim, Quinn here.
We just had a copper go into the shop.
[Quinn] I'm not sure why. He's gone now.
Uh, all clear.

All clear on the western front, Guy. Over.
No names, Eddie. Sorry, Dave.
Hey, you delinquents. What have I told you?
No idle chitchat.
Sorry-- over.
Fuck.
Wakey wakey, gentlemen. I'll keep an eye on the shop from here on.
You two go around to Glentworth Street.
Cover the parking garage exit.
Ok.
Night Jar here. There's some fellow looking through the window.
Uh-- oh. Hang on.
Wait. Hang on. He's going. He's going.
Yeah, he's gone. Over.
Um, Roger, Night Jar. Over and out.
I'm gonna go to the pub, grab some more smokes.
Do you want anything?
Ooh. Uh, pack of Seniors.
There you go, sir.
Two packets of Rothmans. Two Senior Service, and eight bags of crisps.
Two packets of Rothmans. Two Senior Service, and eight bags of crisps. Ok.
Hello, gorgeous. Are we still on track?
We had a scare last night. The cops came around.
Can't you pull rank and make sure it doesn't happen again?
No. We can't show our hand. We're invisible, remember?
Wish I was. What about your friend Terry?
Where's he planning to carve up the proceeds?
Shit.
Pint here, chief? What's wrong?
I'm here to take a break.
Who's that you was talking to?
I wasn't. He was trying to chat me up.
It does happen, you know.
Right. [man] There you are.
Cheers. Keep the change. [man] Thank you.
What are you doing here? You following me?
No. Just wanted a pint.
Then enjoy it.
Hello, Gale. Where have you been?
You're rather impressed with our friend Hakim, aren't you?
I know, rule number one, don't get emotionally involved.
It doesn't mean I can't enjoy my work.
You certainly do.
What does your father think of your consorting with these radicals, anyway?
We are not amused.
Of course, if he knew what I was really up to,
he'd have a heart attack. Hmm. Here you are. Credit cards and cash.
Hmm. Here you are. Credit cards and cash.
If he does have copies of the photos and negatives there, they'll be hidden.
Find them, destroy them, and then get out.
Michael X thinks he's safe tucked away in Trinidad.
That will all change if we're successful here.
Just remember, Gale, he's a nasty piece of work.
He's a crazy, dope-smoking lunatic pimp extortionist
He's a crazy, dope-smoking lunatic pimp extortionist is what he is.
Everything ok, Night Jar? Anything I need to know?
Yeah, everything's all right, mate. Um…
Listen, what if I want to go for a pee up here?
[Terry] I don't know. Use your imagination.
Stay off the radio unless you see any Old Bill, all right?
[Eddie] Yeah, right. If I see the Old Bill, I'll let you know.
I'll speak to you in a bit. Over.
Hey, Bambas, what's all this brickwork?
I don't know. It wasn't on the plans.
Terry! Help!
Terry!
Bambas!
Terry, talk to me!
Hello!
Oh, fuck.
Terry, talk to me!
You all right? I think so, yeah.
What happened?
The floor just caved in.
Bloody hell, Terry. Don't do that to me.
I thought you was a goner.
Give us a light, Dave.
What's down there?
It's a pile of skeletons.
You're joking. Looks like the last gang who tried to take this bank.
Looks like the last gang who tried to take this bank.
Latin. Roughly translated,
"Lamb of God, forgive us our sins."
How do you know Latin?
Catholic school.
The bleeding heart sisters of eternal misery.
Interesting date-- 1665.
You know what year that was, don't you?
The last time West End won the cup.
It was the great plague of London.
This must be a burial chamber,
a crypt where they dumped the bodies.
What, all these poor bastards had the plague?
Well, they could be infectious.
I don't think so, Dave.
This crypt goes all the way under the bank.
It'd put us in the vault quicker. How are we gonna do that?
Concrete for all the vaults.
Time to get paid for all our work. Right.
If we hit the restaurant by mistake, we'll be knee-deep in fried chicken.
I'll be happy if we don't hit the sewage.
When are you guys gonna hit the vault? I'm freezing my tits off up here. Over.
I'm freezing my tits off up here. Over.
[Major] In the army, soldiers would pull on their poots
to keep their blood flowing. Over.
What regiment were you in, the royal corps of wankers?
Over. [Major] Yes. We welcome new members. Roger. Over and out.
[Major] Yes. We welcome new members. Roger. Over and out.
[woman] Emergency operator. Which service do you require?
Uh, the police, please.
[woman] Putting you through.
[man] Police here. Can I help you? Yes. I'm a ham radio operator, and I think
Yes. I'm a ham radio operator, and I think
I may be overhearing a robbery in progress.
We're in. Dave, get the ladder.
We'll make the move into the vault after we take a break.
Need to let the fumes clear out.
You're having a laugh. Let's go in now.
Dave, nothing's going nowhere.
You can hardly breathe in there.
Night Jar, are you there? Over.
Night Jar here. Over.
We're in. Over.
What, in the actual vault? Yes, in the actual vault. Over.
Great. Great. That's great news. Over.
We're taking a break. We're knackered.
We need to get some sleep, get a bit of shuteye while the fumes clear out. Over.
while the fumes clear out. Over.
Oh, lucky you. My eyes are like organ stops. Over.
We can smell the money though. Over.
Look, money might be your god, but it ain't mine, all right?
I want a warm bath and a cup of tea. Over.
You'll get your cup of tea, just in your time.
Oh, lucky you. My eyes are like organ stops. Over.
[Terry] We can smell the money. Over.
I rang four other police stations before you,
but nobody took me seriously.
Said it was probably a hoax.
How strong was the signal, Mr. Eddy?
I'd say they're within a ten-mile radius. There must be a ton of banks in that area.
There must be a ton of banks in that area.
And when was the last time you picked them up?
They've been quiet for about an hour.
What about releasing the tapes to the radio and TV?
Maybe somebody can recognize the voices.
No, no. If they hear themselves,
they'll stop transmitting.
No, we should keep listening.
Maybe they'll reveal where they are.
Alfie, you stay here with Mr. Eddy. I'm going back to the station.
You call me if you hear anything.
Hey.
You scared the piss out of me.
What are you doing here?
I couldn't sleep.
Yeah. A bit jingly myself.
I just had to come and have a look.
Our future is in those boxes.
So, what are you gonna do with your share?
Vanish. Martine Love will cease to exist.
Why? You think if you vanish, you'll become someone else?
At least no one will know who I was.
Why'd you pick Kev and me?
You could have found better thieves.
Old times' sake.
Most of your old times were spent with Kevin, not me.
Kevin has it in his mind we had this passionate affair.
The truth is it came down to four Chinese meals and a roll in the hay.
And that was a long time ago.
All right. Let's make some money.
Look at this!
Look at all this cash!
What? Fantastic.
What? Fantastic. Gold bars.
Diamonds. Diamonds!
[Eddie] Guys, what's going on?
-[drilling] -How'd your wife fancy a tiara?
Too bloody right.
Get the cash. The cash. Look at this.
Emeralds. Ha ha! This is better than winning the pools.
Dave, give us a hand with this one.
What's so special about this box?
It's my lucky number.
All yours, me lovely.
Cheers.
Holly shit. You know who that is? It's Princess Margaret.
Terry, anything for the widows and orphans fund?
Well, that's it.
God bless you, governor. Very generous.
Look, we have to have some sort of system.
You don't know what you're throwing and what you're keeping.
Yeah, well, we know what money looks like,
and we're not throwing that away, are we?
How long does it take to rob a bank?
[Bambas] We just about cleaned this joint out, eh?
More cash.
And look at this.
No, nothing. No, still nothing.
Sergeant, what we need is something that will motivate the robbers
to go on air, give away their location.
Right. Bait to lure the fish.
No, they're not there. Not transmitting.
They're not there, sir.
Move to the next bank, Sierra Lima Two.
No.
We're still getting nothing, Sarge.
Ok, Sierra Lima Two, move to the next location.
My God, the stuff that some people collect.
What you got there, Terry? '47.
'47? It sounds like a good year to me.
It sounds like a good year to me.
Well, then pass it around. [Bambas] Give us some.
Guys.
Yay! Here, Major. Get it down you. [Eddie] Listen, fellows, they're on to you.
[Eddie] Listen, fellows, they're on to you.
Listen. They're on to you. Fuck.
Coppers right on your doorstep.
Speak to me, Night Jar.
Coppers right on your doorstep. Listen. Hang on. Hang on.
Listen. Hang on. Hang on.
They're not going in, but they're not going away. Wait, wait.
Sergeant, we just heard.
The thieves' lookout says there are police outside the bank right now.
Which bank? I haven't got a clue.
We've got patrols outside half the banks in the west end.
Keep listening. We need to pinpoint exactly where they are.
[Eddie] Wait. Hang on.
Guys, you've got a car, just pulled up. Some bloke.
He's going up to the front door with the cops.
Guys, he's unlocking the front door.
They're going in. Shit. Over.
Oh, no. Shit.
Where's the vault? Downstairs.
Follow me.
Looks fine.
I want to look inside. It's on a time lock.
Can't be opened until tomorrow morning.
Well, it isn't my bank being robbed.
Thank you.
Fellows, I think they're going away.
They're gone.
We should get out of here.
They could be coming back. We need to let Eddie know.
We need to let Eddie know. Night Jar.
Night Jar.
No! Fuck!
Shit! Fuck. Shit. Oh, shit.
Fuck. Shit. Oh, shit.
Are you there, Night Jar?
The ambulance reports it's outside the Lloyds Bank on Baker Street.
[Terry] Night Jar, can you hear me?
If you've gone asleep, Night Jar…
Night Jar, are you there? If he's not picking up, something's wrong.
If he's not picking up, something's wrong.
You're right. Let's grab all the cash and jewels and get the fuck out of here.
What about our gear? We can't leave anything that might incriminate us.
We'll come back for it if we can. But what about all the other boxes? It doesn't matter, Dave.
Put everything in a bag, and let's go.
That's right. Let's move. Come on!
No. There's nothing here, Sarge.
Are you sure?
There's no mention of the ambulance.
Nothing. Move on, Sierra Lima Two.
That's them, finally.
Come on, let's go.
The van is leaving. We will follow them. Over.
Stop them as soon as possible.
Open the door!
What have I done, governor?
Open the back door. Come on.
Some fellow paid me 50 quid to pick up his van
and drop in front of the airport.
Jesus Christ.
Where's the van? Change of plan. Precautionary measure.
Change of plan. Precautionary measure.
I've organized alternative transport.
Why? None of us have met your boyfriend,
the alarm bloke who clued you up about the job.
He could have set us up.
We bloody well pulled it off!
Done with military precision, eh, Major?
Now that I'm fiscally secure, I think I'll promote myself to colonel.
[Dave] Hey, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Buy me mum a new house, something with a garden.
I thought you'd be off to Copenhagen, Dave.
Why would I go to Copenhagen? Have your cock shortened.
Yeah, well, maybe what they chop off of mine,
they can add on to your little pinky.
How'd you find this place, Terry?
A bloke I know used to run a chop shop here.
He's in the nick now.
How could you lose control of the operation?
I thought you were on top of this thing?
Sir, it worked. They did the job. They robbed the vault.
And we have no idea where the fuck they are.
Do you know, an ugly thought has just occurred.
Lots of money in that vault, jewelry, money, bonds.
You and your sweetie haven't cooked up something between you, I hope.
You think I'd betray you? There are precedents.
Two of our former colleagues now live in bloody Moscow.
Let's hope they don't have another bidder.
She won't cross us. She knows what we're capable of.
How does she even know who the hell we are?
I'm sure she'll contact me when she comes to her senses.
Going anywhere else would be a death sentence.
You'd better hope she does, Everett.
Or it may be yours.
Here you go, Bambas, this is your lot.
"Never washed after our magic moment." Snow King.
Hey, Dave, look at this.
I've seen this bloke on the TV.
The old perve.
I've seen this face before. He's an M.P. Lord, uh, what's his name.
He's an M.P. Lord, uh, what's his name. You know, always wears those fancy bowties.
You know, always wears those fancy bowties. Not in that picture he's not.
Not in that picture he's not.
Maybe this is one of your old movies, Dave.
Piss off, Kevin.
Timely suggestion.
I believe I'll take my share and be on my way…
before the bank opens in the morning and the shit hits the proverbial fan.
I'm with you, Guy.
I don't have to remind you, keep a low profile.
No buying Aston Martins, Bambas.
The only thing I'm buying is a one-way ticket back to Cyprus.
I'm never coming back.
We should have a reunion in 20 years.
The Savoy Grill.
Yeah, right. Maybe for you, Guy.
They still wouldn't let our sort in.
Bye, Bam.
Good-bye, my friend. Take care of yourself, mate.
Good-bye.
Be lucky.
Bambas…
Good-bye, old chap.
Ok, what's going on with you two. You've been staring daggers at each other
since you left the bank.
Was there a lover's tiff?
I think Martine's got something to tell us.
Hang on, pal. That's Princess Margaret.
Fuck me.
Where'd these come from?
You knew the exact box this stuff was in, Martine.
You better come clean, tell us what this is really about.
About a month ago I got busted at Heathrow on a drug charge.
This guy I know said he'd fix it to keep me out of jail
if I'd do him a favor.
He knew I knew some villains.
He wanted to set up a robbery to get these.
Fucking hell.
That would be the bloke you met in the Player's Club.
Same guy you said was trying to pick you up in the club, right?
Yeah. Well, so who is he?
He's a guy I met in the Sombrero Club.
He works for some shady outfit in Whitehall.
Oh, no, no, no. What, you mean MI-fucking-5 or 6?
What, you mean MI-fucking-5 or 6?
We could get seriously nicked here, Martine.
No, we couldn't. All Tim wants is the contents of box 118.
The deal with him is we get to keep everything else.
You believe that?
Put your trust in some prick we've never even met.
You lied to us, Martine.
We were sitting ducks right from the start.
Thank you very much.
You think it's a coincidence that you get busted for drugs
and your Tim just happens to have a plan to rob a bank?
This can work out.
We give him the photos and everything else in that box
and we get to keep the rest and we're free and clear.
These people aren't regular cusses, Martine.
They're above that. They do things coppers can't.
If they think we've seen these photos, we're as expendable as dog shit.
You know what? I've seen those shots.
And I know we're either dog shit or about to be dog shit.
And I know we're either dog shit or about to be dog shit. I'm out of here.
I'm not waiting for a load of spooks and coppers
to come cracking my head. I'm splitting like guy and Bambas.
It's better if we stuck together, Dave. Oh, why, Terr?
'Cause we've been so truthful with each other so far? Eh?
Dave, come on. No. I'm going home, Kev. See me mum.
No. I'm going home, Kev. See me mum. And then I'm going far away.
As far as I can get away from here.
We better get out of here, too.
In case Guy or Bambas get picked up.
Let's take the lot of this.
There might be something else in this shit to cause us some more grief.
-[Terry] One of those, mate. -Here you go.
-Keep the change. -Cor, mate.
Overheard our radio chat.
Fucking hell…
"The police last night were trying to home in
on the 300,000-pound bank raid."
They still don't know what bank it was.
300 grand?
It was a bit more than that. More like three million.
Hello. [woman] Martine Love.
Thank God. Put her through, then run a trace.
[Martine] It's me. What happened? Where the hell are you?
London.
I know. Of course. I mean, where? I know what you mean.
-Martine, we have to meet. -I agree.
Why don't you come over to my place. I'll make you a cocktail.
We'll have a roll in the hay for old time's sake.
Oh, right, you've already been there, haven't you?
Probably have your men keeping lookout for me now.
You're not in a position to play games, Martine.
No threats, please, Tim.
Why didn't you tell me what it was I was set up to get for you?
For your own good.
I care about your safety, Martine.
Right.
I suppose I give you what you want, we go our separate ways.
Well, that's what I promised. Ok, today, Tottenham Court Road tube.
Ok, today, Tottenham Court Road tube. Northern line. North-bound platform.
10:30 sharp.
Tottenham Court Road. 10:30.
Good.
"London vaults checked after radio ham
tunes in to a crime."
Christ, what a fiasco.
And now the particular bank has been identified, the story will be all over the news.
the story will be all over the news.
We've heard it already is.
If we don't get onto the case quickly,
the police will have nabbed these robbers,
and God knows what will happen to our photographs.
Philip, get over to the bank.
Take control of the situation.
Gentlemen…
I've just had a conversation with one Martine Love.
Where is she?
Call was traced to a public phone box near this court.
Good news is she's arranged to meet.
That is good news.
[Terry] I'll be better off going alone.
Yeah. Tim's agreed to meet.
Yeah. Tim's agreed to meet. It's all over the news.
They found the location of the bank.
So what?
[man] Stand back. Stand back.
[woman] Keep the change.
I'm sorry, ma'am. You can't go in. There's been a robbery.
We know there's been a robbery. That's why we're all here.
[man] Everybody that works here. That means everybody. Speak to them.
Gerald.
You working robbery now, eh?
You're a long way off your patch.
Regional crime squad now.
Just dropped by to see what all the fuss was about.
Pretty cheeky that radio bit.
These walkie-talkie robbers certainly caught your lot on the hop.
Makes us all look stupid.
Yeah, well, you're pretty chummy with all the villains around town.
You got any idea of who could have done this?
None of my informants.
We have been waiting here quite some time,
and so far you people have told us absolutely nothing.
If you would like to give us an itemized list of the contents of your boxes, we may be able to--
of the contents of your boxes, we may be able to--
Are you mad?
The whole point of having a safety deposit box
is so that people like you don't know what's in it.
I want to speak to a Roy Given.
Yeah, that's me.
This robbery's now a matter of national security.
I want everybody out.
Well, this is a police investigation.
Not anymore. Call your superiors.
Who in the bloody hell does he think he is?
Spooks. Five or six-- I can never tell the difference.
They all got the same tailor
and they all went to the same bloody school.
Let's get some copies of the walkie-talkie tapes
out to the news boys.
Maybe the public can help identify the villains.
So tell me,
which of the boxes were ransacked?
The lot. 100s through to 400s.
Well, we're in the crapper, Jerry, both of us.
Both? Well, why is it my problem?
Accounts have to be balanced, records kept.
And I wouldn't likely keep the books around here, now, would I?
Spell it out, Lew. Be more specific.
I have a ledger…
A record of every payment I've ever made to you and your colleagues.
It was in my safety deposit box.
And I think we can safely assume it's now in the possession of the robbers.
Jesus wept…
And I think you'll agree we have to find those villains
before your honest colleagues do.
For fuck's sake.
Who is this? [Vogel] Lew Vogel.
Well, um… Gotta talk. Come on, wake up.
Gotta talk. Come on, wake up.
What you want, Lew?
I'm afraid I've got some potentially bad news for you, Michael.
Your safety deposit box at the Baker Street bank,
what's its number? Well, why do you ask?
Well, over the weekend some thieves broke into the bank vault and robbed it.
So if your box is in the 100-400 numbers,
I'm afraid all your stuff will be gone.
Mine, too, unhappily.
What? How can this happen in London?
Well, I promise you it has happened.
And I promise you these thieves will be found and dealt with.
You can rely on it. I'll keep you informed.
Thank you.
If anyone touches me, follows me,
Martine takes your snaps right to Fleet Street. Understood?
You wanted box 118, Tim.
You have no idea the danger you and your chums are in, do you?
Is that right? And why would that be?
You've opened Pandora's Box, you dumb prick, that's why.
You've opened Pandora's Box, you dumb prick, that's why. I know what's at stake.
And I know how expendable we are.
So I'm changing the deal. -Oh, is that right? -Yeah.
-Oh, is that right? -Yeah. You get all your nasty pictures,
but here's the twist.
We get indemnity. Fresh passports, safe passage out of the country.
Fresh passports, safe passage out of the country. For the whole team.
And an official signed document guaranteeing we won't be prosecuted
guaranteeing we won't be prosecuted and we won't be pursued.
You can't be serious.
You can bet your bollocks I'm serious.
And we want it signed, sealed, and delivered
by a public figure of substantial authority.
How about the Prime Minister? Yeah, he'll do if you can drag him off his yacht.
Yeah, he'll do if you can drag him off his yacht.
You mess with us, Tim,
we can drip feed pictures like this to the press.
We've got a stack of them.
Oh, dear.
You've got until 4:00 p.m. to confirm we have a deal.
We'll be in touch.
Some photographs.
Well done, Tim.
Do you have any more?
Apparently there was a whole rogue's gallery stored in one of the boxes.
If Lord Drysdale is up to his usual hanky panky, that's his problem.
This operation is about recovering the photos from Michael X.
Might it not be prudent to get the committee to consider issuing a D-notice?
To protect everyone potentially embarrassed by this criminal activity.
Which we instigated.
[man] Very nice. Very nice indeed.
When I came out, there were a couple of lads taking some photos.
Photos of him.
Now, he was standing right outside the bank
just a few days before it was robbed.
I thought at the time he looked a bit shifty.
Oh! Oh, my God!
Christ, is that thing real?
I've got it. Dave Schilling.
That's his name.
Ta ta, Mum. Look after yourself, love. Mmm…
Go and get yourself inside. You'll catch your death.
Dave Schilling? Yeah?
I wonder if we could have a word.
About what?
About a bank.
I want to tell you something, Mr. Schilling, 'cause it'll save time.
You see,
I have a very jaundiced view of life.
From what I've seen, most of it's corrupt, venal, and vile.
And I'm saying this so that you know that I don't have a better nature to appeal to
that I don't have a better nature to appeal to or a compassionate streak.
I mean, you do understand, don't you?
I think so, Mr. Vogel. Good.
I have a kidney stone that I don't seem to be able to pass.
I have a kidney stone that I don't seem to be able to pass. I'm on pain killers.
I could use a couple of those meself.
You stole from me.
And from friends of mine.
Now, where's my stuff? I don't know.
Look, I don't know anything about any bank robbery. Honest.
Still an unconvincing actor, Mr. Schilling.
I would love to say this is not gonna hurt,
but it is.
What-- what are you gonna do?
Wait! No! No!
No! N--
Please! No!
Please! No! P-- p--
Well, they were here. Well, they ain't here now.
Boys, it's all right.
Who are you?
I could ask the same thing.
Better run along, eh?
Get yourselves a cup of tea or something.
We're looking for Terry Leather.
Terry said he won't be coming in this week.
He's supposed to call in.
So you'd be Eddie, right?
Uh, yeah. Well, you're coming with me.
What do you think you're doing? Leave him alone. Don't you…
Shut your noise!
We want to talk to him about a bank robbery.
[Eddie] Don't you touch her! If you want to see your Eddie or his mate Dave again,
If you want to see your Eddie or his mate Dave again, make sure Terry Leather calls that number.
Wha…
Walkie-talkie gang takes it all!
Read all about it!
Walkie-talkie gang takes it all!
[Tim] That's great news, over.
[Terry] We're taking a break. Need to get some sleep.
Get a bit of shuteye while the fumes clear out. Over.
[Eddie] Oh, lucky you. My eyes are like…
Mommy, Daddy's on the radio.
Oh, don't be so silly, darling. He is!
Is he?
[Eddie] I want a warm bath and a cup of tea, over.
[Terry] You'll get your cup of tea. Just your type.
See? It is, Daddy.
[man] Authorities have released this recording
of the walkie-talkie communications
between the robbers of Lloyds Bank in Marylebone
in the hopes that their voices…
-[phone rings] -may be identified by members…
Hello?
Wendy?
We heard you on the radio, Terry. You're famous, you know.
You robbed that bank, didn't you? The one in the news. Oh, God.
You could go to jail for years for something like that, Terry.
I couldn't stand it.
No one's going to jail. I've got it all under control.
Just stay put. Keep the kids inside.
I love you, Wendy.
I've got to go.
You be careful, Terry. [girl] What's the matter, Mom?
Nothing, darling.
Terry. They took Eddie.
Oh, God. Who? Two heavies.
I don't know. They could have been cops.
They left a phone number for you.
They said if I wanted to see Dave or Eddie again,
They said if I wanted to see Dave or Eddie again, then you have to call.
Listen to me. I swear to you I'll get him back.
Don't you worry, darling. Have you got a pen?
Yeah.
01946--  Hold on. Say it again.
-01946… -Yeah.
Michael, it's Lew Vogel. [Michael] Yes?
Well, we've identified the villains.
And believe it or not, they're amateurs. Part-timers.
They were put up to the job by a woman named Martine Love.
-Ring a bell? -Never heard of her.
Well, we paid a visit to her flat.
And some chaps from MI5 were already there.
Pulled rank on my tame copper.
Why do you suppose these people would be interested in the robbery of a minor neighborhood bank, Michael?
in the robbery of a minor neighborhood bank, Michael?
I don't know. I think you do.
And I'm guessing that your box is number 118.
I think what these robbers were really after were photographs.
Photographs of a certain royal princess.
How do you know that?
Well, because on this point I believe my captive.
No man can withstand the pain we inflicted on him.
So don't take me for a fool, Michael.
You've instigated this calamity
by storing your blackmail materials in this bank.
Which you recommended. I will not be lectured by the porn king of Soho.
I will not be lectured by the porn king of Soho. Get my pictures back
or you will never see a Black man on the streets of London
without wondering if he's been sent to kill you!
What you doing? Oh, hello, Michael.
Hakim was looking for a copy of his book.
I know what you been looking for, birds. And you won't find it.
What are you talking about?
Hakim, I found your book.
You don't understand.
My box and those of my friends may have been rifled.
Surely you can pull some strings.
You're a minister in the government, for God's sake.
Sonia, I really don't think I'm able to help here.
Perhaps you don't fully comprehend.
I have photographs, compromising photographs,
live film of you, Miles Urquhart,
live film of you, Miles Urquhart, all my regulars in this safe deposit box.
all my regulars in this safe deposit box.
You all know each other, if that's any consolation.
You've got photographs of me?
You conniving cunt.
You be a big boy.
Now's the time to talk to your Whitehall chums, don't you think?
That's him. I'm sure that's him.
Guy Arthur Singer.
Con man and petty criminal.
Did a stretch in the scrubs a few years back.
Thought he was a wanker. Spoke in some poncie accent. Hm.
Thank you, sir, very much.
Hello. Who am I talking to?
Oh, Terry Leather, Kevin Swain, Martine Love, Eddie Burton.
Kevin Swain, Martine Love, Eddie Burton.
Yeah, Mr. Schilling was kind enough to speak with me about this.
You put Dave on the phone, eh?
Well, I would, but, uh,
he seems a bit indisposed at the moment.
What do you want?
Just a couple of things from what you stole.
A ledger with a dark red cover
and some photos that I'm sure MI5 is interested in…
The royal portfolio.
[scoffs] All we got is money and jewels.
Then I suggest you look again.
Speak to your friends.
Hello? Who's this? Eddie, it's Terry.
Terry. Terry, you fucking know…
Dave's all messed up, and they're gonna do the same to me.
You got to help. Listen to me, Eddie.
I don't have what he wants.
What? No, no. You got to have what they want.
No, no. You got to have what they want. You got to.
You got to help.
Eddie, what am I supposed to do? You tell him we don't have it!
Oh, Terry, Terry, you've got to…
Tell him I don't have his fucking ledger!
You tell that cunt now!
He doesn't have it.
Right.
What are you gonna… No!
No! They shot Dave!
-Eddie? -Dave's dead!
Eddie! They shot Dave!
I'll give you one hour to find what I want
or I'll kill this man, too.
Fuck!
This is it.
"Lew Vogel."
That's who this bastard is.
"Payments made to Soho West End division officers."
Here are the weekly payouts.
Fifty quid here, 20 there.
Probably every bank copper in London.
Nothing like this was supposed to happen.
No one was supposed to get hurt. It's not your fault.
We still got our own necks to think about, and Eddie.
We give the photos to Vogel, all bets are off with Tim.
We deliver them to Tim, it's Eddie's neck,
and Vogel and his lot are after us.
Either way we are fucked.
Miles, we've got a problem,
a serious problem.
Something Sonia Bern kept in the bank
that was robbed over the weekend.
She's concerned that her safe deposit box may have been plundered--
I'm afraid her fears are well justified.
Oh, my God.
I really felt Sonia was a woman of more discreet character.
So, the genie is out of the bottle then…
for both of us, eh?
Not quite yet.
My operatives tell me that the thieves
My operatives tell me that the thieves are using the photographs as a bargaining chip.
Then give them what they want. Already in motion.
And the committee have it in the works
to issue a D-notice on the whole business.
Muffle the press.
Put a lid on it.
What?
Be a pity, wouldn't it?
I mean, if your mates abandoned you over a few photographs and--
Hello. You listen to me, Mr. Vogel
or whatever your fucking name is.
You go ahead and kill him. See if we give a shit. We got our loot,
your ledgers and your photos, you can pick 'em up from Scotland Yard.
We're sending them over. Don't do that.
Well, if you want your book of payoffs back,
be at Paddington Station in person tomorrow, 11:00 a.m., platform one.
There's a newsstand near the statue of the soldier.
Have Eddie with you, hale and hearty.
This is your one and only chance, Vogel.
Don't blow it.
Don't answer it! Catherine!
Daddy! Hi, you! Come here.
Here you are, I got you a present.
You been good for Mommy? Yes!
I need to talk to Mommy about something, so give us a minute, ok?
-Go on. -Go on.
So… you want to tell me what's been going on?
Some blokes worked over Dave.
How bad?
He's dead.
Oh, my God almighty, Terry.
What have you done to us?
Wendy, I promise… I'm gonna work this out.
And when I do, we're gonna leave England
and it is all gonna change for us.
If anything goes wrong, use this.
There's plenty of cash.
Pounds, francs, dollars.
You can leave the country. Start a new life for you and the girls.
You can do this if you have to, Wendy. Promise me.
Is that from the robbery, is it?
My share, yeah.
The papers said there was a woman involved.
Martine was it? Was she involved?
Yeah, she brought us the job in the first place.
Oh, and did you sleep with her, Terry?
Do you know what? From day one, it was always you.
The first day we met, I said to my friend Audrey,
I said, I am gonna marry him.
And I am gonna have his kids.
And I have stuck by you!
I have stuck by you, you mental!
You bastard!
Fuck.
You can throw me over.
I deserve it.
I've brought you more grief than happiness.
But I love you. And the kids.
It's the reason I did this, to get us out of this life once and for all.
-[rattling] -[girl] Mummy, open the door!
Mummy, Mummy! We'll work the rest out later.
Go play in your room!
If you'll still have me.
She takes a good picture, eh, Tim?
Lord Mountbatten has graciously agreed to represent
the interests of the crown in this matter.
He high enough up the tree? Lord Mountbatten?
I've always wanted to meet that bugger.
Yes. Well, I'm sure he'll be very pleased to meet you, too.
He has to be under the main clock,
Paddington Station, 11:00 a.m., or no deal.
11:00 a.m. On the knocker, with your new passports and documents.
He'll hand them over as soon as he sees the photos.
There's another problem.
This robbery's pissed off some local villains.
The guts come with the glory, eh?
One of our mates has been killed.
Hardly surprising, considering the roster of reprobates who are the bank's
the roster of reprobates who are the bank's deposit box customers.
Listen, Terry, our commitment is for the recovery of the royal portraits only.
The proceeds and the piss-offs are both yours to deal with.
11:00 a.m. Paddington Station.
Gale…
Michael wants to see you in the garden.
-What for? -I don't know.
Gale. Come. Come and look at this.
Come.
I want to show you something. What's this for? Aah!
[Michael] This for you.
What have I done to deserve this? What have I done?
You're a spy sent to steal from me.
And nobody steals from Michael X. -[screams] -No one!
See if it mentions the copper in charge.
Here it is. "Heading the case
is Detective Sergeant Roy Given of Marylebone Lane Police station."
Roy Given.
No Roy Given mentioned.
Let's hope that means he's straight.
And that he'd be interested in the names of some bent coppers.
Yeah, bit of a long shot.
-Fuck it. -Nothing in that one?
No.
What, we don't rate a mention?
Strike you as strange?
It's kind of scary, actually.
If that news could disappear. So could we.
[man on P.A.] Next stop, Edgware Road.
Well… here's to us.
See ya, mate.
Look after yourself. Take care.
[Terry] Good luck, Kev.
So, where are you headed? If everything goes to plan?
I'll tell you if you're coming with me.
Morning. I'm looking for a Mr. Roy Given.
It's very important.
Roy Given? Yeah.
Yeah, well, can I ask what it's concerning?
No. I'd prefer to tell him myself.
Look, all I'm saying is, if you're interested
in the rest of this book of payoffs, the author's gonna be at Paddington Station,
the author's gonna be at Paddington Station, 11:00 a.m., platform one.
And how exactly did this come into your possession?
[man on P.A.] Next stop, Paddington Station.
Change here for the Bakerloo line.
Let's hope no one turns up fashionably late.
There's your friend Tim. Good luck.
It's good to see you in one piece.
You were worried for your own ass, Tim, not for mine.
You pricked him.
You set this whole thing up from the start, didn't you?
Come on. You get to be rich, free and clear.
Isn't that what you wanted?
You stay here with the car. -Right. -Uh!
Ohh. Bloody kidney stone.
It's got to pass soon.
Haven't had this much excitement since the war.
We're a little late, My Lord.
So where's your mate?
That's Terry there, by the newsstand.
Wait. I've seen those two cowboys before, at the girls' flat.
It's a trap. They're MI5.
[Eddie] Terry. Terry!
Lord Mountbatten?
-Yes? -You know the arrangement,
and you agree to our new identities and immunity from prosecution?
You have my word that the crown will honor this commitment.
Your documentation and guarantees.
If I were you, I'd keep them in a very safe place.
Yeah, well, you can bet it won't be a safe deposit box.
She is a scallywag. Thank you.
Martine.
It wasn't all business for me.
-What's happening? Where's the book? -[man] Just open the door.
-No. No. -Get in there.
Stay there or you're dead meat.
-Uhh! -Where you going, old man, eh?
-This one's for Dave. -No.
-Uh. There, you fucker! -Aah!
So fucking smug now, are you?
Oi, you-- Uh. Uh. Oh.
Get out. That's the bloke that killed Dave.
Get your hands off me.
Arrest them. They're the bank robbers.
-Fuck! -[Eddie] This bloke killed our friend.
I'm innocent.
So are we seriously arse up now, Terry?
At least we're not dead, like poor, old Dave.
Get up, you filthy bastard. Oh, you wouldn't--
You're under arrest. Take him away.
You're under arrest. Take him away. [man] Right. Come on, you.
[man] Get in the car.
It's all right, mate.
Wonder if that's Roy Given.
Who's he?
We was hoping he was a straight copper.
We've got a nice collar here, Roy.
You know these two were part of the Baker Street bank robbery gang.
Place this man under arrest. -[man] Yes, sir. -What are you talking about?
They're part of the Baker Street firm.
I don't know about them, but I know about you, you corrupt bastard.
but I know about you, you corrupt bastard. Cuff him, and the one over by the wall as well.
Cuff him, and the one over by the wall as well.
But they're the robbers.
No robbers in here.
[man] Watch your head.
Now. I believe you've a certain
Now. I believe you've a certain Mr. Vogel's book of shame.
Well, if you let me out, I'll go get it for you.
That belongs to me.
There's your book.
[Tim] Terry. We were thinking, smart fellow like you
might have kept mementos of the event, just in case.
In case what? Things didn't turn out so nicely?
If they should ever see the light of day,
don't think we can't find you.
Out. Go on, piss off.
And you. Go on.
-How did that happen? -Fucked if I know. Just keep walking.
[man] Michael, Michael.
What's going on? What you want to my place, huh?
-What you want? -We are placing you under arrest.
What am I charged with? Conspiracy to import drugs
Conspiracy to import drugs into the United Kingdom.
Will that do? But you could still help yourself.
There's a British national staying with you,
a certain Gale Benson.
She was here but she's gone on.
All right.
[man] Over here, sir.
Burn the house down. I want nothing of this place left standing.
Were you friends of Dave? -Oh, yeah. -When?
We knew him in a professional capacity. [giggles]
[woman] He was one of our favorites.
You all right? Yeah. So where are you off to, Kev?
Yeah. So where are you off to, Kev?
Anywhere you wanna go.
Sorry. I'm doing a solo from now on.
Yeah, well, it was worth a try.
Do you want another one?
Yeah. Go on. One for the road.
All right.
I just wish Dave could've seen all this.
Yeah. Here's to Dave.
-[clinking] -[all] To Dave.
What do you want, Martine?
I'm sorry I've caused you this upset, Wendy.
Well, apparently, we're rich.
I know the business is finished, but are the cars really ours?
Yeah.
They're all yours.
Jessell's been paid off.
I won't lie to you. I'd have gone with him…
and I'd have shut you out of my mind.
But he didn't want to know.
I'm sorry.
Your wife's talking to Martine.
I know, Kev.
I know.
Good luck.
It was always you, Terry.
[Wendy] Yay!
Nice with a few chips, though, huh?
You sure you wanna know?
Truth is, I'm a nobody.
Actually, I'm worse than a nobody.
I'm this guy.
Stop! Stop the bus!
-[metal clangs] -Ow!
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.
Thanks.
But, like any story worth telling,
it's all about a girl.
Not that girl.
-Hey, hi. -I don't think that is a girl.
No, it's about this girl, Jill Johnson.
Ever since I can remember, I've been in love with her,
but she barely knows I exist.
Yo, Rick! Yo, come here, man!
I got you a seat down here.
What's that? I'll call y'all back. Everybody, bye. What's up, man?
Everybody, bye. What's up, man? -Hey, Trey. -Dude, I'm so psyched
-Hey, Trey. -Dude, I'm so psyched for this class trip. Like we 'bout to see
for this class trip. Like we 'bout to see some real serious cuttin'-edge shit.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Yo, you got any C batteries on you?
AAs? Got that new sandwich -from Sony in my backpack. -[angelic music] Wifi, mm!
Yo! You gotta forget about her, dawg.
Look, look, let me show you something.
She not even lookin' at you.
[sighs] If I could just tell her how I feel, I…
[sighs] Look, Rick, I already told you,
you never gonna get with Jill, all right?
Seriously, she hangs out with the popular crew,
and nobody messes around outside that group, man.
Come on, that crew stuff isn't real.
The hell it ain't. Look around, Rick.
Look, you got your jocks. Get the ball, man.
Nerds, emos…
Frodo's,
-the Scarface Society, -[gun cocks]
-the sexual predators. -Mm.
Of course you got the Rick punchers. The who?
Oh! Yeah, they're new, mm-hm.
But you know what? Who cares?
'Cause we got our own crew, me and you.
Thanks, Trey. You're the best, man.
-Am I in? -No.
Come on! Hey, it's me and you, baby.
The two of us against the world, you hear me?
You look good today. I like your hair.
I'm gonna show you somethin' nasty I downloaded.
-Don't tell nobody. -[sheep bleat]
Welcome to Amalgamated.
I'm Dr. Strom, head of the Research Department--
-Come on, man. -…where we create the future today.
And now I'd like to show you our crown jewel,
the Amalgamated Animal Genetics Lab. -[bird calls] -[uplifting music]
Go ahead, explore.
[Trey] Yo, yo. Come on, Rick, man, check this out.
All of our animals are genetically engineered
and each of them has… And right over here…
Oh, you're so pretty.
Oh, hi, birdie [chuckles].
Hi, hi [laughs].
She's beautiful, isn't she?
Yes, she is.
Uh, I'm gonna take a picture of her for the school newspaper.
Our only rules, don't feed the animals. And please, no flash photography.
And please, no flash photography.
Some of our genetically engineered animals
are a little sensitive to light.
It flew away.
What the F, loser?
-Get him, Lance. -[Lance grunts]
Come on, Lance, leave him alone. -[Boy] Show him what's up! -I don't think so.
Is there a problem, Lance?
No, no problem, Uncle Lou.
Mr. Landers!
Students, this is Lou Landers,
Visionary Scientist and CEO of Amalgamated.
Well, I'm just a businessman now.
The future of science belongs to all of you.
-Please, enjoy the tour. -Thanks, man.
Are you okay?
Yes, this is healthy-cough blood.
Rick Riker.
You're not Blaine and Julia Riker's son, are ya?
I am. Ah, good people.
How are they? They died violently nine years ago.
But otherwise okay?
Yes, thank you. I live with my aunt and uncle now.
Well, you seem like a real chip off the old block.
Let's hope you're not violently murdered, too.
That's for making me look stupid.
-Next time, I hurt you. -Oh, man, that must hurt.
Yeah [laughs].
You the man, Lance.
Our work with these animals has helped us develop new antibiotics,
has helped us develop new antibiotics, advanced pesticides and a powerful new pheromone

It's a strong sexual attractant.
A single drop is enough to arouse any animal.
We plan on using it to breed endangered species.
A special and indeed, often overlooked [speaking softly].
But our most-promising research is with these dragonflies.
For example, this dragonfly's skin has a hard,

And this species of dragonfly
has enormous strength for its size. -[animals chittering] -[Rick gasping]
-[animals chittering] -[Rick gasping]
It can lift vast amounts more than its body weight.
And here we've injected the DNA from all three species into seven
new genetically-enhanced super dragonflies.
But there's only six in there.
Well, one missing dragonfly is the least of my concerns.
I lost six tigers alone last month. -[Rick groaning] -[dramatic music]
This area is where we -keep our livestock. -Oh, oh!
Aren't you gonna do something?
Soon as I get this up on YouTube.
I see. Yeah, oh, yes, I understand.
Thank you for the call.
That was the principal.
Rick walked off a class trip. [sighs]
After all the parenting you've done,
he's still so troubled.
Why do you think that is, Albert?
I have no idea, Lucille.
I've taught him everything I know about being a man.
And a good man you are after all these years of marriage.
It's like we first met.
Sure, you're a little older.
Your hair's gray.
You have crow's feet.
It takes you an hour to pee.
Your thighs look like cottage cheese
someone threw up on a hot sidewalk.
And you've always had a tiny penis.
Well, [chuckles], what does it matter when you're in love?
Oh, Rick.
We were wondering where you were.
It's so late.
It's about time you got home. Your aunt was getting worried.
You can sleep late in the morning,
but don't forget to feed the fish.
-Attaboy. -[Rick groans]
I don't know, something just doesn't
I don't know, something just doesn't seem quite right with him today.
Teenagers. I'll talk to him.
Rough day, huh?
Well, I won't lie to ya.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life.
Puberty is a difficult time in a young man's life. This book may explain what's happening.
Let's see.
"There are mood swings, fluid retention,
and once a month you'll bleed from your vagina."
This may be the wrong book.
What's important is that you're on the verge of adulthood.
Now, here. Take a drink.
Ah, the rituals of manhood.
Today you have your first beer,
and tomorrow we'll circumcise you.
I'm losing patience, Dr. Strom.
Please, sir, if you could just wait a few minutes-- I've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
I've waited long enough for this egomaniac.
We're the Board of Directors. Our time is valuable.
Not as valuable as mine, Mr. Carlson.
You see, I have a terminal illness.
I've been fighting it for years,
but the disease has ravaged my organs.
As of this moment, I have one hour left to live.
It was on sale.
Gentlemen, if you're ready,
allow me to show you the future.
What the hell is that?
An innovation. Thank you.
An innovation. Thank you. That will not only save my life but the life of this company.
That will not only save my life but the life of this company.
For too long we've scraped out profits from pills and injections.
The real prize is the total cure. A device that can alter DNA
A device that can alter DNA
and restore the body to perfect health.
You're crazy. No [laughs].
Crazy is hearing voices, talking to cats,
dating Paula Abdul.
I'm not crazy. I'm a visionary!
Sir, sir, the machine's never been fully tested.
If something should go wrong--
-Start the machine! -Yes, sir.
Plasma level's steady.
Genetic modification's at optimum levels!
Sir, the core is overheating.
We have to abort!
Did it work?
-I'm so sorry. -[board members whispering]
Well, well, well. I want you to know what a joy
Well, well, well. I want you to know what a joy it will be running this company without you in the way.
it will be running this company without you in the way.
Let go. Let me go.
Gentlemen, I think it's time we made some personnel changes.
-[board members yelling] -[bones crunching]
How long was I asleep?
Five days.
Wait!
Oh, Dad [sighs].
I thought you'd live forever.
[Lucille] Breakfast, Rick!
I'll be right down!
If I can have your attention.
We are delighted to have, as guest judge,
the foremost scientist in the world.
He's a visiting professor at Empire City University
where he's working with the rare element cerillium.
I am so proud to welcome Dr. Stephen Hawking.
[voice box] Thank you for that warm welcome.
I have a disease that has paralyzed me.
I cannot walk and I use this computer to speak.
But I am not depressed because I have the gift of knowledge.
That's a lie. I think about suicide every day.
But you should all be happy with your lives.
You can walk, talk, wipe your own asses,
and then there's all the sex. [students] Oh!
I haven't had sex in years.
My nurse is a lesbian and not the hot kind. [students] Oh!
Hey, anyone wanna get high?
I've got some hash with me.
-[students] Oh! -White guy in the dreads,
you know what I'm talking about.
Oh! Anyone, anyone?
Anyone, anyone?
Pussies.
Watch where you're goin' in slow-mo, dipshit.
Yeah!
Go to her, stupid.
Tell her how you feel.
Uh, he did it.
I'm gonna kill you. -Get him, Lance! -Get him!
-Lance, stop it! -Yes, Lance!
Hide, hide, hide.
[boy] Slug him, Rick!
Damn!
Ohh!
Get off me!
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Shit, shit, shit, shit.
-[horn honking] -[dramatic music]
Get outta the way! No brakes!
Get outta the way!
-Aah! -Gram, look out!
[Woman] Are you okay?
-How did you… -[Man] I can't believe it.
You just saved that old lady's life. Amazing.
I guess if I hadn't have pushed her out of the way,
she would have die [gasping]…
You should be really proud of yourself.
You're some kind of hero.
If you could excuse me.
-There we go. -Oh! Awfully nice of ya to help me out here, Trey.
Oh, no problem. I'm waitin' on Rick anyway, so.
My God!
How did ya do that?
Uh, it's easier than it looks.
No, I don't think so.
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
All right, well, well, there is something, okay?
But you have to keep it a secret.
I think I have super powers.
I find that hard to believe.
All right, all right, how 'bout this?
Go ahead and throw as many punches as you want.
I bet you 100 bucks you don't land one.
[Albert] Easy money.
What else can you do?
Well, I don't know. I was bitten by a dragonfly.
Some dragonflies have armored skin.
I wonder if my skin is--
Well, good thing that worked.
So you do have superpowers?
We could be a team!
We gonna get fame, money--
Don't forget the bitches.
There's not gonna be fame,
and there's not gonna be bitches, okay?
I didn't ask for any of this.
I just wanna be like everybody else.
That isn't what your parents wanted for you.
You're not my father.
But I love you like your father did.
I believe in you like your father did.
I had sex with your mother just like your father did.
[sighs] You'll never understand me.
Never!
[Albert] That isn't what your parents wanted for you. [echo] parents wanted for you… parents wanted for you.
What a great performance.
Well, Rick, did you enjoy the opera?
Son, is something troubling you?
It's so unfair. They have nothing.
I wanna change things. [liquid chugging]
And you will.
One day, Rick, people will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Give me your wallet! -[Julia gasps] -That too.
-[Julia gasps] -That too.
People will look to you to be a hero.
When that day comes, will you be ready?
Rick!
Rick, please!
Daddy! Oh, Rick, I'm dying.
-No! -Don't worry.
My brother Albert will take you in.
Rick, the money. It's all yours now.
Sell all shares of a small company called Google.
It's worthless. Invest heavily in Enron.
Rick, I have something for you.
Reach into my coat pocket.
[gasps] The other coat pocket.
That ring was my father's,
and his father's before him.
Earn it, Rick. Be a hero.
-Claim your-- -[ring pings]
…destiny.
Dad!
I'm no superhero.
I'm nobody!
[Man] Shut up back there! I'm gonna kill you! -[man yelling] -[objects clatter]
Are you okay?
What, you heard that?
You're nothin' but an ugly, ungrateful little whore, just like your mother!
ungrateful little whore, just like your mother!
Who was that? -My mother. -Listen,
-My mother. -Listen, about what happened at school this morning, I--
You really freaked us out.
I'm really goin' through a tough time right now.
Me too. My parents, they want me to go to college,
but I wanna be a dancer.
I believe in you.
You really do, don't you?
I wish I could say the same for Lance.
I don't know, is he the right one,
or am I just dating him to rebel against my father?
He doesn't want any boy near me.
-That's why he installed-- -[electricity crackling] …the electrified fence.
Well, we'll see. You can't run from your destiny.
Right? Right.
Jill, let's go!
Nice car.
Maybe one day you could take me for a ride in your car?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
Lovebirds.
Rick, this is Professor Xavier.
Your powers are growing, but you can't control it.
Your powers are growing, but you can't control it. It's important that you--
…become a hero.
Train yourself to fly--
…in your ass because--
…squatting on a glass table--
…two girls--
…one cup--
You know what to do.
This shouldn't take long. Well, I'll be waiting right here.
Hello, Mr. Bailey.
I've reviewed your request for a loan, Mr. Riker,
but with no job, no credit history,
I'm afraid I have to say no.
But what about this?
That was last month.
This new promotion's proving quite popular.
Look, I need to buy a car.
Frankly, Mr. Riker, you're the worst applicant we've ever had.
Thanks for the loan, Mr. Thompson. [laughs]
This is a good boy. There must be something I could do.
Ma'am, rubbing my crotch under the desk won't change my mind.
I'm not rubbing your crotch.
I really need that car.
I don't see how that's my problem.
[shot fires] This is a robbery! Nobody move!
Everybody stay down! Stay down!
Get down. Come on, lady! -Hurry it up! -Oh.
Come on, move it! Let's go!
Oh, hey, I made the same mistake before when I came in.
Thanks.
You idiot! You let him get away with our money!
I don't see how that's my problem.
[Man] Oh, man!
Wow.
Come over here. You've got to see this.
Let me through, let me through.
Oh, thank God. I thought something terrible had happened.
Well, an old guy did get shot over there. -[pensive music] -[siren wailing]
Uncle Albert! Just try to breathe.
I can't. You're kneeling on my balls.
Oh, sorry.
Rick, listen.
With great power comes…
Great responsibility?
I was gonna stick with bitches,
but if you wanna be a virgin for the rest of your life-- -[gas hissing] -[Albert mumbling]
-Uncle Albert! -My balls!
Very good.
Oh, God. Mr. Landers!
-[woman gasping] -[dramatic music]
Oh, no!
There you go.
Hide the body. Hide the body, yeah.
Get in! Yeah!
Okay, I come back.
Jill?
I came as soon as I heard.
This is all my fault. Rick, it was an armed robbery.
There was nothing you could've done.
I coulda stopped that guy before he shot my uncle.
Rick Riker? -Yes? -Dr. Whitby.
-Yes? -Dr. Whitby.
What brought you here today?
My uncle. Your uncle brought you?
No, he's gravely injured. Well, then he shouldn't be driving.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to perform a breast exam.
Doctor, please, is my uncle gonna survive?
Well, I'm not a betting man but if you wanna put some money on it,
I'll take dead in a week. -Oh, my God! -No, it's all right.
-Oh, my God! -No, it's all right. It's a normal emotional reaction,
but this should take the edge off of it.
Here we go. Nice and easy.
That's your vein.
Yes, I know…
First my parents and now this?
I'm nothin' but a screw-up.
Yes, your life has been a testament to that.
But your uncle believed in you, and so do I.
It's never too late to become the person you're meant to be.
[Man] Rick.
Rick?
-Hello, Rick. -Who are you
-Hello, Rick. -Who are you and how do you know my name?
-I'm a psychic. -Prove it.
Think of any number between one and a million, and I'll tell you what it is.
and I'll tell you what it is.
Nine. Not out loud, dumbass! [sighs]
Follow me, you dumb son of a bitch.
My name is Professor Xavier, and this is my school.
I started it to help people with special talents like yours.
Our students here learn to harness their incredible talents and use them
their incredible talents and use them to advance the common good.
Here we have children who can walk through walls.
We have children who think -they can walk through walls. -[groans]
Some faces may be familiar, like Wolverine.
Other mutants you probably didn't know existed,
-like Sneezo. -[sneezes]
Most of our students are born with their powers.
Some, like you, gain them later in life.
-Whoa, is that-- -Yes, it is.
When he came to this school, he weighed 130 lbs.
Take enough 'roids, you could do anything.
Back up off those pills, Barry!
Why have you brought me here?
Because you have the potential to be the best.
But I can't even fly.
Once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
But, first, I must teach you the secret to becoming a superhero.
Hey, Storm! You look like you puttin' on a little weight.
So, Professor, about this secret.
-Well, you see-- -Xavier!
-Well, you see-- -Xavier! Aw, shit.
Well? You wanna explain why I found her hidin' in your closet?
But, pumpkin, I don't see nobody.
Oh, you don't?
[Rick] Invisible Girl?
Apparently not invisible enough.
Well, if you knew how to take care of your man, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
-No, she didn't. -Oh, this bitch is crazy.
I'm gonna have to whip your ass.
You don't say no disrespectful shit. What are you gonna do, baldy?
-I'm everywhere-- -Wow! -…sweet cheeks. -Whoa!
-[laughs] This all you got? -Yeah!
-[Invisible Girl gasps] -Now what? Now how 'bout that, Invisi-bitch?
You know, whatever. I'm outta here.
How could you do this to me? To your kids?
To your newborn baby?
How do I know that baby's even mine?
Because he can do this.
Shit!
Aw, man.
Now I'm never gonna know the secret to becomin' a superhero.
You wanna know the secret? Come close.
Make a costume, shithead!
I swear to God, they get dumber and dumber every year.
A costume.
Rick, you, uh…
Oh my God.
Damn!
Oh, dude, you're, like, a real superhero, man!
[laughs] I love the mask. How you breathe in it, though?
How you breathe in it, though?
-[air hissing] -What's that sound?
You put some kinda air intake in the mask.
Boy, you better…
Now, I'm assumin' that the material's see-through, right?
Yeah, dude, I'ma tell you somethin', Rick, this is good.
I'm impressed. Like really impressed.
Hey, that's my spot.
You're sittin' on my gargoyle. Move it.
-Excuse me? -What are you even doin' here?
I'm looking seriously out over the city.
Well, that's what I do here. So, if you're not movin',
I guess we're gonna have to share.
Uh, okay, fine, okay.
-Okay, okay, okay. -Okay.
Uh, I can't perch like this. God, me neither.
What's your name? John Storm.
Dragonfly.
So, what's your power?
What's my power? Stand back.
Flame on!
I'm on fire! Get a blanket or somethin'!
I'm on fire! Get a blanket or somethin'! Holy shit! It's not working!
Get the fire extinguisher!
Oh, no!
God, you idiot, stop!
What's wrong with you?
-Oh, sorry, my bad! -[John thuds] -[horn honking] -[car alarm beeping]
[Professor Xavier] Rick, once you understand the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
the true nature of heroism, you will fly.
Aw, shit.
It's Dragonfly.
He's not even a hero.
He's not, I have, I have, I have just a… I have… [laughs]
He can't-- [laughs]-- he can't even fly. [laughs]
The Dragonfly can't even fly. [laughs]
I can fly, okay?
I can fly.
This just in. Tom Cruise is dead.
[Lou] Strom, do you have my test results?
I'm afraid you have to kill each day to live each day.
Hm. Unless you had some cerillium.
Take a look.
Hawking's lab is in the physics building.
I could just walk right in.
You're going to steal cerillium?
No, not me.
But perhaps there's someone inside me, someone who will, at any cost, survive! [laughs]
someone who will, at any cost, survive! [laughs]
Ha ha! Oh, glass in my eye. Glass in my eye! Shit.
-Does it hurt? -Uh, yeah, it hurts.
Well, if you could spread them with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers.
Push your lids with your fingers. -Two fingers? -Are your fingers clean?
That's it. And roll your eyeball around.
-Roll it and then push it. -I'm rolling it!
Dig it out with another piece of glass.
Are you fricking insane?
I'll get the tweezers.
Read about the Dragonfly, world's greatest hero.
-Right here? -Right here, yep.
Read all about it.
No, you listen to me!
I want that story on my desk, or you're fired! [receiver slams] Who the hell are you?
[receiver slams] Who the hell are you?
I was wondering if you got a job opening for--
Job? How dare you come in here and ask me for a job!
I'm the Editor-in-Chief! I know the mayor of Venus!
Hamburgers can see the future!
-Rosie O'Donnell is gonna… -Sorry about this.
We share the building with a mental hospital.
Bad news, boss. We're nowhere on those Dragonfly photos.
Damn. Those were tomorrow's lead.
What about these?
Wow! It's almost like you're the Dragonfly.
Uh, no, no, no.
See? Look.
-Now that's photography. -Just heard on the scanner
-Now that's photography. -Just heard on the scanner some kind of police standoff at Empire University.
We'll need photos. Kid, I want you to…
Where'd he go?
-[siren wailing] -[dramatic music]
Come on, let's go!
This is the Chief of Police.
We have the building surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.
What the hell is that?
I am the Hourglass!
And your time is up.
[Woman 1] The Hourglass is moving!
-[Woman 2] Yeah! -[Woman 1] Get him, Dragonfly!
It's useless to resist!
I'll fight you to my last breath!
Like the sands of time, I am unceasing and relentless.
Evil never triumphs, Hourglass.
You'll pay for your crimes and justice will be…
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
-Are you okay? -No.
Titanium blades.
They cut through diamonds.
I'm not wearing any diamonds.
I wish I could stay longer, Dragonfly,
but I just don't have the time.
[Trey] Titanium blades.
Looks like someone found your weakness.
It's not my weakness.
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.
Your weakness is that you can't fly.
Maybe if you had a partner--
I don't need help.
I'm fine all by myself.
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?
What? Oh, oh, no.
I mean, she's with someone else.
Well, maybe that's for the best.
After all, it could be dangerous,
being the girlfriend of the Dragonfly.
I don't know what to do, Aunt Lucille.
-I love her. -So be it.
But remember, to get to you,
your enemies will attack the people you care for the most.
Be careful not to hurt the ones you love.
Whoever this Dragonfly is, he's in over his head.
We don't need so-called superheros.
What Empire City needs is more cops
and a Hooters.
Jill.
-Rick? -I heard
you were auditioning for a part, so…
Oh, they're beautiful.
God, you are so supportive.
Why can't Lance be more like you?
There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?
Something secret, something locked away deep inside.
Well, there is…
[Lucille] Keep your identity a secret, Rick, Rick, Rick…
[Trey] Dude, you're like a real superhero, man, man, man!
[Albert] "Once a month you'll bleed from you vagina, vagina, vagina, vagina."
I…
Nothing.
Nothing?
Well, I should go.
You're a good friend.
[Man] Hey, check this out.
-Come on. -Not bad, man.
Oh, shit.
[Man] You better run!
-Let's go! -Come on!
-Get her. -On her back.
Where you goin'?
Oh God, it hurts. It hurts, please stop!
Please stop, I'm begging you! -[head thudding] -[man groaning]
Wait!
Where are you? Behind you.
You saved my life.
Do I get to thank you?
Go. Be a hero.
Yeah.
Paper clip guy.
I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend
are spending Thanksgiving with us.
Of course, Lucille. You need support at a time like this.
You need support at a time like this.
Yes, I miss seeing my Albert each morning.
You know, 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.
I wish I knew love like that.
Oh, you will, dear.
You just have to follow your heart.
That's the thing, I don't know if I can.
Oh, Jill.
If you can't trust yourself, who can you trust?
I know.
But what if my heart is telling me to be with someone I can't be with?
-[cat yowls] -It's not just any guy. It's the… Forget it.
It's the… Forget it. You'll think I'm crazy.
No, of course not.
You can tell me anything.
I'm very good at keeping secrets.
Well, you'll think it's ridiculous,
-but it's the-- -[doorbell rings]
-I'll get it. -Oh, thank you.
Hey, babe.
Oh, I forgot to tell you I kind of invited my uncle.
-Your uncle? -What? Set another plate.
Well, okay, I guess.
Miss Johnson, please, excuse my nephew's poor manners.
Thank you.
Ms. Adams, I'm Lou Landers.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
Oh, of course not. There's always room for one more.
Thank you.
It's just that Thanksgiving's for family.
Lance is the only family I have. -I never married. -Fruitcake?
-I never married. -Fruitcake? Nope, just never met the right woman.
Ah, yes, Lance told me that Rick Riker was your neighbor.
Where is Rick?
Well, that's odd.
I thought he was out. I'll go check on him.
Please, you're busy. Allow me.
Thank you. Upstairs, second door to the right.
Rick?
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, Mr. Landers.
Rick.
Oh, you're just on time.
Everybody, take your seat.
Not till we say grace.
Jesus!
[all] Amen.
Please start, everyone.
This all looks so delicious, Lucille.
Well, we have Rick to thank for it.
Ever since Albert,
Rick has been supporting me with his new job.
New job? You didn't tell me.
Oh well, I'm sort of the Dragonfly's unofficial photographer.
What happened to your arm?
Uh, a bike messenger knocked me down.
I see your wrist is bandaged.
Yes, I burned it on some hot coffee.
And you have a cut on your lip.
my crack pipe broke.
You have a scratch on your neck.
Yes, I met a girl on Craigslist.
And you have a bruise on your neck.
I met a guy on Craigslist.
I'm sorry, Lance, we have to go.
Why? I…
shat my pants.
[sighs] I'll drive.
Thanks for helpin' clean up. Of course.
Poor thing's so tired.
Yeah, well, you know old folks after a big meal.
So, you know the Dragonfly?
Uh, yeah, I guess.
You could sorta say we're close.
Has he ever asked about me?
Um, yeah.
Yeah, once. What did you tell him?
Well, I said, I told him,
I told him, "The thing about Jill is,
when you look in her eyes and she looks back in yours you--
You know that you'd do anything,
anything to be a better person than you are so that--
If you were ever lucky enough to be with her,
you could earn every second of her perfect--
Grace, and her limitless beauty--
And her unending love."
-Don't cry. -I'm not.
My eyes are burning.
Rick, I want you to know that was the most beautiful thing
anyone's ever said to me.
Scented candle?
Thank you.
Rick, I'm so confused, and yet--
I know exactly what I want.
Sorry to drop in uninvited.
It's okay. We were hoping someone would open a window.
It was getting stuffy in here.
So, this is the lair of the Dragonfly.
How did you… No, no, no, I'm not here to fight you.
No, no, no, I'm not here to fight you.
I've got thousands of other people I plan to kill.
This little visit is just to show you
who'll get hurt if you get in my way.
Never!
Time to go.
The woman,
The woman, Lucille Adams of East Empire City, was badly injured.
[Reporter] How was she injured? Badly.
What about the Dragonfly?
All I can tell you is this-- he didn't save anyone tonight.
-Reporting live-- -Doctor, how is she?
I'm afraid your aunt's taken a turn for the worse.
She can't speak, she can't walk, she had no control over her bowels.
-That's, that's awful. -I know.
-That's, that's awful. -I know. I went ahead and set up a MySpace page
for her under Crazy Shit Machine.
She already has 40 friends.
Wait a minute. That's somebody else's aunt.
Your aunt has no problem with her bowels.
-Oh, thank God. -Because she's dead.
I'm truly sorry, Rick, but there is a silver lining.
Your uncle came out of his coma this morning.
-He did? -Yes, but you mustn't tell him
-He did? -Yes, but you mustn't tell him about your aunt just yet.
He's in a delicate mental state. The slightest bit of bad news
could send him spiraling right back into a coma.
I understand.
Mr. Adams, you have a visitor.
Is it Lucille?
No, sir, it's not your dead wife.
It's your nephew Rick.
Remember, no bad news.
Now, sir, here you go. This is my bill.
You did surgery on me?
Yes, sir, we confused you with one of our sex-change patients, but don't worry.
of our sex-change patients, but don't worry. We didn't remove your penis.
We did cut your testicles off,
but, well, since your wife's dead, you won't be needing them anyway.
You just wanna keep his spirits up.
He'll land on his feet in no time.
-[bell tolls] -[minister] We are gathered today to say goodbye to Lucille Adams.
[all] Goodbye!
[minister] And now the eulogy.
It's tragic to think this is the last time
that I can look upon my wife's face.
God, Lucille!
How could you take her from me?
I can't live without her!
-Aah! -[mourners exclaiming] Lucille! Snookie lumps!
I'm sorry. There's been a terrible mistake.
-[neck cracks] -This is your wife.
She is this man's wife.
Give me five minutes.
-Uncle Albert! -I'm not finished. Uncle Albert!
You're one lucky guy. Now, where's Lucille?
Now, where's Lucille?
Ah, Lucille.
I do have this coupon for a cremation.
Rick, [sighs], I am so sorry for your loss.
What is it?
[sighs] I know I said some things,
but now more than ever, I realize
we can never be together.
I don't believe you.
You love me, Rick. I know you do.
Jill, trust me. I'm telling you this for your own good.
I don't love you.
You're no longer in my five.
[gasps] How could you?
Don gave that to you?
You can't keep gettin' lucky, man.
You only beat me by two strokes this time.
And the back nine is what killed…
Oh, my God!
Look at this place.
Yo, what are you doin', man?
You gotta pull yourself together, dude.
What's the point?
Look at you, eating junk food, wearing fake beards,
and we found your costume in the garbage outside.
Yeah, well, I'm not the Dragonfly anymore.
But you said the Hourglass was gonna kill thousands of people.
Look, I told you I'm no hero, all right?
Look, I told you I'm no hero, all right? Aunt Lucille's dead, I've rejected the only girl
I've ever loved, and, I mean, I can't even fly.
God, I wish I'd never been bitten by that stupid dragonfly. And maybe your father shouldn't
And maybe your father shouldn't have given you this after all.
Look at the words your ancestors inscribed in that ring.
"Honor, valor, sacrifice,
duty, commitment, bravery, justice,
integrity, brotherhood, self-esteem,
integrity, brotherhood, self-esteem, low prices, affordable housing,
loose-fitting pants, cheap internet porn."
The rest is in Latin.
Rick, the hero's path is dangerous.
You may fail or you may fly. All that matters
is that you do it for the best of reasons.
Helping others, Rick,
that's what makes you a real hero.
Maybe you're right,
but even if I wanted to stop the Hourglass,
I wouldn't know where to start.
I mean, where's he gonna find thousands of people in one place?
-Look. -How's it looking out there?
[on TV] Reporting here live from the Empire City Convention Center
where thousands of people are in one place,
but none of them more important than the attendees of the World Humanity Awards.
-I'll drive. -[engine rumbling]
Well, that shortcut through the playground sure saved us some time.
You go ahead. I'll find a place to park.
Mister, please stop!
Each year, the World Humanity Awards
are held to honor the greatest achievements on behalf of all humanity.
This gala event is expected to draw
the world's most prestigious leaders to Empire City.
Excuse us, excuse us, excuse us! Empire City Times.
Damn! Look, there go Prince Charles.
-[Man] Your Highness! -And Nelson Mandela. Nelson! Hey, I was in jail too, man.
Nelson! Hey, I was in jail too, man.
One of the guests here is the Hourglass.
But which one?
Thank you so much for inviting us, Mr. Landers.
Well, when you're being honored by the world,
you want your family with you.
Perhaps one day you could be part of our family, too.
Ladies and gentlemen, our first award
Ladies and gentlemen, our first award is for the medical breakthrough of the year.
For his company's pioneering work in the field of feminine hygiene,
I award Lou Landers Douchebag of the Year.
Hold up the Douchebag! Hold up the Douchebag! Hold up the Douchebag, sir.
Stop right there, Landers.
Mr. Riker.
So, you know.
You're damn right I do.
Someone in this auditorium is the Hourglass.
I need your help to figure out who it is.
Now, the Hourglass can be anyone--
a guest of honor, maybe even a stagehand.
This may be nothing, but I did see a man with what looked
like a canister of cerillium.
Who?
-This year's-- -Him. …Lifetime Achievement of Humanity Award goes
…Lifetime Achievement of Humanity Award goes to one of the world's greatest souls,
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.
This man isn't who you think he is. He's the Hourglass.
No, no, I'm a man of peace.
Shut up! You're plotting to kill all these people,
Shut up! You're plotting to kill all these people, and I can prove it. Show the world the armor
and I can prove it. Show the world the armor you're hiding under these robes.
You can't fool me, Hourglass.
You're packing ten pounds of cerillium under there.
-What? -Ah!
Take him down.
Tutu.
Peace! P--
[voice box] Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
You!
You're the Hourglass.
[Rick] Hourglass!
HeroCon?
It's a convention for people who like to dress up as their favorite heroes and villains. By the way,
By the way, -your costume sucks. -Out of my way!
Hourglass, you'll never get away with this!
Forget it, Dragonfly. You're too late [laughs].
Run!
Yeah.
Goodbye…
…little fly.
Dragonfly!
No!
My eye!
[voice box] Dragonfly, you must stop the Hourglass.
I can't.
I can't fly.
If there is one lesson my life can teach,
it is that the spirit is stronger than the body.
The hero comes from within.
Those are Celine Dion lyrics.
Whatever. It's still true.
You're right!
It's working!
-Ohh! -Sorry.
Watch, Dragonfly, as your city dies!
Where am I?
You're with me, your lover.
Dragonfly!
No.
No!
Only now do you understand.
I need you to yank this off.
-Oh. -There's not enough time.
Oh, fuck.
It's over.
Dragonfly!
Jill!
Got ya!
Rick? You didn't think I'd let anything happen
to the girl I love, did you?
Well, we're still falling.
Damn it! Oh, if only I could fly.
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a hero.
You know, maybe I was meant to have a normal job,
an accountant, a gym teacher.
This is a really tall building. Rick, I don't care what happens anymore.
Rick, I don't care what happens anymore.
If I die, I die happily in your arms.
You're my hero, Rick Riker, and I love you.
Yes!
Oh, thank God! We only had 50 stories left.
Hang on.
[voice box] Thank you, Dragonfly.
Because of you, our city is safe at last.
You said it, Dr. Hawkin.
Shit! Well, it's a happy ending for us all!
Let's go get some dinner. I'm buying.
Who am I? I'm Rick Riker.
I'm the Dragonfly.
And as long as there's crime and injustice,
I will forever be a superhero--
My dad says my breasts are too big for a dancer.
Maybe he's right.
I mean, look at them.
They're just huge, worthless, floppy weights.
Yes, worthless.
Dr. Hawking, I am such a fan.
I'd love to show you my project on supernovas.
You have an incredible ass-tronomy career ahead of you.
Wait, where's Saturn?
I'd hate to lose my father's bowling ball.
There it is.
Gentlemen, if you're ready--
allow me to show you the future.
Strom?
From the, from the, lift it over…
Lift it over!
-Can you fly? -No.
-Can you see through walls? -No.
-Can you see through walls? -No. An you see through a tube top?
No.
Can you fix a prostate?
Strom, you have my test results?
Whatever you're doing to your victims rejuvenates you,
but only for 24 hours.
What if I killed 28 people in one session?
Would that give me a month to live?
If it were February, yes.
You.
You're the Hourglass.
It's a pity you saw that, my dear.
Perhaps this will help you forget.
What are you doing?
Take me.
This, uh, this, uh,
this turtleneck's really strangling me.
You have no idea. I'd let you. I'd give this off
the skin on my back to you, a knockoff.
You can have it on the way out.
Old McDonald had a farm and Bingo was his name-o.
And uh, that's uh…
[Man] Tom?
Yeah [laughs].
I, uh, I'm, uh… [laughs]
-Seriously? -I got it, I'm good.
Oh, you're goin' it. [Man] No, I'm not doing anything.
I just wanted to ask you--
Stop.
-No, like-- -Just shut up.
-No, but-- -Shut up.
-The only thing is-- -Hey.
-there was a rumor about-- -Hey.
-You wanted to-- -Stop.
-You did claim, however-- -Stop.
Okay, but you did say you agreed
to be here, and you said that you would talk
-about some of the-- -Shut--
-Yeah. -…up.
Okay.
This is the guy who wipes Wolverine's butt.
Where you been?
-What am I supposed to do? -[claws clanging]
-Sorry. -Sorry doesn't wipe my ass.
[sighs] Come on. Put some shoulder into it.
Are you going right now?
Dragonfly?
People throw some crazy shit in the trash.
Amazing. Do you work with the Dragonfly?
-Well, the thing-- -Yes, he does.
We're a team.
What do they call you?
Me?
They call be the Incredible Black--
Rooster. He's the Incredible Black Rooster.
If I may, sir?
In 2003, Mr. Landers won the National Science Award
for his invention of the nonstick toilet seat.
That thing saved my grandma's life.
She big.
Excuse me, there is a line.
No, you're killing him all wrong. It's like this.
Better.
Oh, shit.
It's so unfair. They have nothing.
Why do we have $2,000,000,000?
Well, your grandfather left us $3,000,000,000,
and I made some bad investments,
but that's nothing for you to worry about.
I've got tomorrow's editorial. When you sleep with someone,
you're sleeping with everyone they ever slept with.
Does that make you gay?
Yes, yes, it does.
Well, someone will think twice
before they try to steal a pack of gum from you again.
This is gonna be difficult for you, Rick,
but you need to identify the body.
This isn't my aunt. Yes, that's why it's so difficult.
Hang on, hang on.
[both] One, two, three.
Where's Aunt Lucille?
She's at home under heavy sedation.
They made her watch three hours of women's basketball.
I wanna be a dancer.
I bet you're great.
I am pretty flexible. [grunts]
Unless you had some cerillium,
then you could create a device powerful enough
to draw the life force out of thousands of people
and enhance your own cellular capacity.
Konnichiwa.
What?
Konnichiwa. Konnichiwa means, "What's up?"
So what the fuck's up? We know what it means.
Hey, you want a smoke?
You can read the paper through this, it's so clean.
A couple of hits, you'll be fucking like beasts.
You boys like pussy, right? Hey!
Do we look like fucking tweakers to you?
So you got the shit or not? Yeah. You?
What the fuck is this? We said a machine gun.
It is a machine gun.
The kind you can carry.
Couldn't get none of those.
This baby's got character. Korean War vintage.
Maybe even mowed down one of your grandpapa- sans
when he was charging the wire at Inch'on.
This is bullshit. It's fucking stuck.
This is bullshit. It's fucking stuck. Fuck it, take the ride. Three large. VIN's clean.
Nigga, I drive a $100,000 car!
We want your faggoty-ass ride, we'll jack it from you.
Cool. Don't decide right now.
Konnichiwa is Japanese. It's insulting to Koreans.
How am I supposed to tell if you can't?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean, white boy?
It means you got eyes like apostrophes, you dress white, talk black and drive Jew.
So, how am I supposed to know what kind of zipperhead,
dog-munching dink you are if you don't?
Yo.
Do you know who the fuck we are?
Yeah.
You're a couple of panheads buying a machine gun out of a trunk.
(GRUNTING) Wassup, you son of a bitch?
Pick him up. Get your ass up.
I'm getting the shit out of here.
Give me the keys!
Konnichiwa, bitch. Let's go!
Where?
It's okay. I'm a cop.
Captain Wander, congratulations on breaking the case.
Can you tell me how you found the twins?
Julie, my people had turned the city upside down looking for these girls.
I could not be prouder of my men.
OFFICER: Ma'am, excuse me.
How can you shoot a guy taking a dump?
I mean, seriously. That... That's sacred. That's like shooting a man in church. Or a Dodger game.
That's like shooting a man in church. Or a Dodger game.
Hey, whatever it takes to be a hero. Anytime, anyplace, right, Lud?
It gets old.
I hate these short-eyed, kiddie-raping bastards.
At least kidnap some full-grown ladies with shapes.
Wow. Maybe you should check his closet next, huh, Lud?
The girls are being examined by a physician right now.
Both twins are in good health
and will be reunited with their family shortly.
SANTOS: tomorrow is gonna say, LA Times front page
"Vice Detective Rescues Missing Twins."
Detective. Singular.
Yeah. Like we've been sitting around on our ass
doing jack-shit in our unit the last month.
Hey! You two cut the shit. The boss is on his way right now. I mean, you could have saved some for us.
I mean, you could have saved some for us. I did you a solid, Santos. You did me a solid?
I did you a solid, Santos. You did me a solid?
You want to see their faces every night? You want to be a killer?
You know what? Shut the fuck up.
Hey, hey, what the hell is going on?
Hey! This is real professional.
What if I walked in here with the Chief, huh?
Santos, deploy your ass outside.
Find Ted Berman and make sure that that crime scene log is in order.
Yes, sir. Run along, boy. SANTOS: Shut the fuck up.
SANTOS: Shut the fuck up.
WANDER: Hey, secure that bullshit, all right? Both of you.
Clady, you take DeMille back to the barn and start writing.
I want something to red-pin by midnight.
Tell those body monkeys to get right in here.
You got it, Cap. Let's go.
This is crazy!
You fucked them up!
This is beautiful.
And that machine gun shit, that was perfect.
I know you hated waiting, but it's better this way.
Yeah. I... You all right?
I got shot. Yeah, but you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay, Jack.
'Cause I know you're not tripping about these... These assholes right here?
Fuck them. Screw them.
You went toe-to-toe with evil and you won.
You saved those girls. This is lovely, Tommy.
Come here. Come here, man. Give me... Give me a hug!
Come on. (TOM GROANS)
What you hiding from? Ribs are tender.
What you hiding from? Nothing.
You've been drinking.
You know that... That thing they say about vodka?
How you can't smell it?
It's bullshit. The D.A.'s shooting team is en route right now.
And you're not ready for public consumption.
So, come on. I want to get you to a hospital,
get you away from all those guys. Come on.
All right. Thanks, Jack.
I think we can do some damage control.
If it ain't LA's deadliest white boy.
Aren't you on the wrong side of the yellow tape?
Congrats on four more notches for your gun belt.
I'll be praying for the families of your victims.
They're called suspects.
The victims are the 14-year-old school girls the suspects kept in a cage
and sold to chicken hawks to poke, prod and put on the Internet.
Suspects, Washington.
Suspects.
As evil as those men were, they had a right to trial.
There's gonna be some blowback from the Korean community on this one.
Now that you're all militant, why don't you just say it?
You think I'm a racist.
You have another explanation? No, I don't.
Because if I roll and determine the suspects are black, yellow or brown,
I'll blow them out of their socks.
But if they're white, I'll give them a ride home.
You know why? 'Cause I'm a racist. Fuck you.
Man, I would give my right arm to have that shit on tape.
What happened to you, Terrence? We used to be brothers.
Hey, hey, stay on point. Washington, you stay on point.
Always, Captain Wander. Always.
Tom. Come on, let's get you out of here.
Don't go near that piece of shit. He's got it coming, Jack.
Do not go near him. You stay away, far away.
Fuck him. That's an order.
I'm waiting for Nurse Garcia.
I did the same thing with this girl once.
She was a waitress at a jazz bar.
And I'd sit in her section, wouldn't let anybody else serve me.
She'd change sections, I'd change tables.
Persistence. That's the key.
Wait a second.
You're that cop! You're... I just seen your face on TV.
You rescued those twins in Koreatown, right?
Are you okay? Did you get shot?
No.
Yeah.
Who the hell are you?
Me? I sell insurance, life, auto, casualty.
Wow, that's some heavy shit, man.
So those guys, they... They shot first, right?
Excuse me?
Whole city was looking for those kids.
How'd you find them?
That's my job.
WOMAN: Sergeant Green, Sergeant Green... Excuse me, Captain. Sorry to interrupt.
Excuse me, Captain. Sorry to interrupt.
Deputy Chief Sorensen is trying to raise you on a simplex.
Insurance, Tom. I sell insurance.
If you ever need any, and you will, why don't you give me a call?
No one has to know but us. Not Clady, not Wander, no one.
Listen, for your own good,
don't get yourself so far out there that I can't reel you back.
See you sometime.
Who was that?
A cop who burns cops. Jesus.
Who? Nobody, Grace.
Hi. Hi.
Hold this.
You know, you can just stop by sometime.
You don't have to get shot when you want to see me.
(GROANING) Why? I like it like this. Don't you?
No, I don't. (SIGHS) I don't.
No. Don't get close to me.
I work here. I'm not losing my license for you.
No. I'm a cop.
Whatever.
TOM: I kicked the door after identifying myself as a police officer.
Upon entry, I was fired upon by a suspect in the living room with a silver automatic.
I returned fire, he goes down.
Then I'm hit in the torso by shotgun fire from the second suspect.
Point of entry?
Front door on the west side of the structure.
OFFICER: Why didn't you call for backup?
Exigent circumstances.
I heard screams emanating from the house and ascertained a crime was in progress.
...saying something. Take care, Silk.
It was great working with you. Thanks a lot.
Now it's a party.
Oh, my goodness! Now it's a binge, Captain.
What's up, killer? Steady.
Steady. Yeah, he's in.
What's with you? What, Clady give you a happy ending?
Is that any way to address a commander?
I got the call from the Chief this morning. Badge ceremony's next week.
Congratulations, boss.
Hey. We're gonna have the keys to the city.
You believe that shit? They're crowning him king.
Let's get a toast to that. A toast to the king!
King Wander! King Wander!
Yo, boss. Can I be your driver when you make chief?
WANDER: You got it. You got it. Whatever you want.
You know, I owe you one, Tom.
That Park twins caper, that gave me the edge.
You know, the Chief, he's breaking tradition by promoting me here.
The first commander slot always goes to the head of Internal Affairs.
That's the way it is.
That's because they got so much dirt on everyone.
That's because they got so much dirt on everyone. That's right, and they're always looking for more, huh?
Yeah.
You know this prick?
Came at me like Joe Concerned Citizen, asking procedural questions.
Yeah, yeah, we got a history, this little...
See, if you showed up during the daytime,
you would know who your enemies are.
What'd you tell him?
I couldn't help myself, Clady. I told him everything.
DeMILLE: Attaboy!
DeMILLE: Attaboy! You know, this is a typical Biggs bullshit move.
You know, this is a typical Biggs bullshit move. This is his M.O. He'll back-door you every fucking time.
Why is Internal Affairs up my ass all of a sudden?
It's Washington, brother. Your ex-partner's been snitching.
Holy shit.
Jack, talk to me.
Washington's had several meetings with Captain Biggs over the last few weeks.
There are no secrets in the department.
So, when I became cognizant of the problem,
we threw a tail on him.
we threw a tail on him. I followed this guy Eastside, Westside, Southside.
Next thing I know, he's ringing Biggs' doorbell in Upland.
Who's Washington giving up?
You, Tom. Me. Why now? Yeah.
Me. Why now? Yeah.
Because I shitcanned him from the unit and he's a vindictive bastard.
Now he's on a mission to pull the rug out from under all my best guys. All my best guys.
from under all my best guys. All my best guys. That's what this shit is about.
CLADY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! CLADY: Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy! Man!
CLADY: Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy! Man! Tommy, hey, that's your life. That's your life right there.
Tommy, hey, that's your life. That's your life right there.
No, you're not. You're not. I'm just gonna talk...
No, you're not. You're not. I'm just gonna talk... You want to talk?
You want to talk? Let's talk about my foot up your ass if you don't sit the fuck down
Let's talk about my foot up your ass if you don't sit the fuck down He's all right. Have a seat. in that goddamn chair.
He's all right. Have a seat. in that goddamn chair. Come on. He's all right.
WANDER: What the fuck is wrong with you?
Do not, and I repeat, do not hand Washington your badge.
I know you two have done some dirt together.
But we gotta hold the line, you and me.
We've been here before, haven't we?
When the gates of hell opened up on you, Tom?
And I took care of you then. I'm gonna take care of you now.
All right?
Okay. Okay.
Washington. Washington.
What the hell are you doing? Drop it, Tom! Now!
(PANTING) You going to kill me, partner? You're crazy! We got a 211 in progress!
I got you, I got you and Wander.
Listen to me, you idiot!
We got two gangbangers rolling in hot!
Shit!
Washington, stay with me, partner.
Don't move! Let me see your hands!
I'm a cop. I'm a cop! I'm a fucking cop!
Fuck. It's Ludlow.
Get me an ambulance. Now.
Holy shit.
He's a cop, too?
Yeah.
Where's the video?
Who else has seen this shit? Just us, boss.
It was a straight 211 that went sideways.
It's not what it was, Lud. It's what it looks like.
It's not what it was, Lud. It's what it looks like. But it's not what it looks like.
That's all there is, Tom! It's not.
What it looks like! What everybody sees! You knew that!
Lud, anybody in the department sees this video,
you're no longer a cop, do you understand that?
The department? The D.A. sees this... He's... He's going to prison.
Why? Because Washington was in the wrong place at the wrong time?
Why? Because Washington was in the wrong place at the wrong time? No, because you were.
Washington's problems are over, yours are just beginning.
Try to think two moves ahead for once.
Captain Biggs will say that you got two thugs off the street
and went after a cop who was diming you out to Internal Affairs.
It writes itself.
I was just gonna break his jaw. That's a good answer.
That's a good answer. I gave you a direct order, stay away from him.
Give me your goddamn burner now.
Give me your goddamn burner!
We know you don't give a shit about yourself, Lud. That's pretty obvious. But you gotta think about the unit.
That's pretty obvious. But you gotta think about the unit.
You really fucked us on this one. Clady.
Give me a minute, please. Yes, sir.
I can't afford to lose you.
Who'd do what you do?
You are the tip of the fucking spear.
Who's gonna hold back the animals?
Maybe
the clerk
forgot to put the disc in the recorder today.
Maybe you were first on the scene, Tom, and you rendered aid to Washington.
I'll go outside.
Make some calls.
And maybe,
this won't be here
when I get back.
TOM: He was my partner back in the day.
We were black and white in a black and white when it was still a big deal.
White cops wouldn't back us 'cause of him and the black cops 'cause of me.
Fuck them.
We made it.
Sorry. You tried to save him. You did your best.
My best? I was curled up in a ball while he got shot.
We should have dumped those guys.
How can they just wave a pen and change what happens just like that?
We're the police. We can do whatever the hell we want.
Doesn't matter what happens. It's how we write it up.
What about the truth?
What about it?
You have to honor him, your friend.
"Honor him"?
I was going to knock him out and he thought I was going to kill him.
Prick.
Don't turn your back on him.
Good can come from bad.
In my world, the real world,
the bad breeds more bad, Grace.
See this? It's done. It's over. It's taken care of. All right?
I won't give you another dose here,
but got a set of blues in your locker?
Here's the thing. No.
I gotta bury you. Not that.
In a nice, politically correct spot until this Washington thing settles down a little bit.
No, Jack.
SUPERVISOR: Your job is to conduct preliminary interviews of the complainant.
If there's a specific allegation against an officer,
write it up, forward it to Internal Affairs.
Now, the temptation is to be a good brother cop.
Don't be. None of this shit's going anywhere anyway.
There's your desk.
Suppose I get a complaint against myself?
(CHUCKLES) Write it up and forward it. Okay?
Okay. Okay.
You have a complaint?
Motherfucker beat my ass like I was Rodney King, man.
Except there wasn't no video.
Dude looked just like you.
But black.
But black. This ass been working longer than all y'all cops disrespecting me.
He pulled me out of my ride, homes, disrespected me in front of my old lady.
Tried to get her number and shit.
You get his badge number or see his nametag?
Not with his boot on my throat and his partner kicking me.
No, it was a little bit difficult.
Everybody comes here, they have a complaint.
They sit down. I done waited for my fucking five hours
and you gonna ask me, do I have a complaint?
Obviously, I have a complaint.
You know what? This is some bullshit.
That's why I hate all these motherfucking cops.
That's why I hate all these motherfucking cops. Fuck all y'all!
Wander has got a sense of humor, I'll give him that.
You have a complaint?
Where to begin?
The black band.
Man down. Hurts, right?
Losing a colleague. Brother in blue.
I'm sorry he's gone, sir.
You two worked Vice Special together. Pushed a black and white in Southend.
Phonebook Tom,
the last of the ghetto gunfighters.
I heard you got your best confession with a '91 directory.
You know Washington was holding the asshole down.
Is this an interview?
Just a little back and forth.
Well, Captain, I'm not much of a dancer, so if there's something you'd like to ask...
Want to go and get some lunch, Tom?
This is the interview.
Regarding yesterday's incident, you were the first on scene, correct?
Yes, sir.
Three shooters, right? Two. Read the report.
What would you say if I told you the pathologist recovered
three different calibers from Terrence Washington's body?
Sounds like three shooters to me.
What were you doing there, Tom?
Come on, man to man. Tape's off.
Damn it!
It doesn't bother you that there are two cop killers out there?
Living, laughing, fucking? It doesn't bother you, Tom?
Yes, it bothers me!
So, why'd you let them get away, gunfighter?
Hey, let's get something straight, Captain, nobody's getting away.
What happened to the video from the store?
What video?
Listen to me. Every time you shit the bed,
Wander's there to change the sheets. Well, not anymore, son.
I'm going to pour gas on you,
I'm going to pour gas on Wander and everyone in Vice Special.
Then I'm lighting the match and I'm gonna burn all of you.
I tried to save you, Detective Ludlow.
Your window's closed.
And that third shooter? He's mine, so help me God.
WANDER: Get back in your office!
WOMAN: Captain, you there? I'll call you back.
What the fuck are you doing in my office?
What the fuck are you doing jamming my people at lunch?
If you got a problem with Ludlow, you come to me.
You keep your dog on a leash.
Everybody knows he can't make a move without you.
You go cry to Daddy? Stop right there.
You go cry to Daddy? Stop right there. Stop.
Tom is a damn fine cop.
He bleeds blue.
You got an open case on him?
Vice Special?
You got one on me?
You formally investigating us?
This is a fishing expedition.
Because you know if you went to the Chief and you asked him
to open a case on me or anybody in my unit,
he would laugh you out of his office.
Listen to me, you piece of shit.
I have watched you intimidate, bully and blackmail
your way up through the pay grades for 20 plus years.
I know exactly what you are.
You've got no business being a commander.
You like Tom, don't you?
I saw the way you watched him when he came in.
That's why you follow him around, you want him to give you a blow job.
Like that hooker I caught you with when we were sergeants.
Shut up, Jack. You remember?
Does your wife know that you use prostitutes, Jimmy?
It was the best head I ever had.
And what about you, Jack?
You always found it hard to keep your prick out of the ghetto.
It's a two-way street, buddy. You can't ride the tiger forever.
Now get the hell out of my office.
Now get the hell out of my office. Do the department a favor,
and wash your mouth out with buckshot.
Come on, Tom. Let's get out of here.
From his time on the street to his time in your schools and homes,
Detective Washington was tireless
in his devotion to his church, his love for his family,
and his dedication to this department. Uniform Detail. Atten-hut!
Uniform Detail. Atten-hut!
OFFICER: Honor Guard, port arms!
Half right face!
Ready, aim, fire!
Aim, fire! Aim, fire!
Uniform Detail, present arms!
MAN: He was a good guy. We'll miss him.
We'll go back to work now. Back to work.
Let's go get them. Listen, that was a nice speech. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Mrs. Washington.
I was first on scene.
Yeah, of course you were.
Excuse me.
You Diskant?
Yeah.
You're working Washington?
Yeah.
You know who I am?
Yes.
You planning on interviewing me?
(CLEARS THROAT) You're on my list.
Well, let's get rolling. Where do I start?
Gang books? Mug shots? 211 reports?
If you want.
Come on, Diskant, you've worked a homicide before.
I'm two for two. (SIGHS)
Okay, two for two, you got a ballistics report?
No. The bullets are still at the coroner's.
Yeah, but they're giving you updates, right?
They tell you how many different calibers they dug out of Washington?
How many? What do you want?
Goodbye, Detective.
Hey. Harry!
I thought you were dead.
I'm from Vice Special.
CORONER: Tom Ludlow. I know who you are.
I handled your wife's autopsy.
That was you? Mmm-hmm.
The asshole. Remember?
Right.
The guy who washed away all the hair and fiber evidence.
The guy who wouldn't do a vaginal swab.
The guy who left me nothing to go on.
It's not my job to investigate adultery.
How can I help you?
Pulled these out of Washington? Yup.
Eighteen rounds.
Ten .45-caliber full metal jackets.
Seven 9-mil FMJs.
And a single .38 hollow-point mushroomed against his scapula.
Serious overkill.
He must have really pissed off the shooters.
DISKANT: Get what you're looking for?
Hi, I'm Detective Diskant. We spoke on the phone earlier.
How you doing? I'm here for the ballistics evidence.
DISKANT: Thank you.
When can I expect your report?
CORONER: Give me about an hour or so. The lab's backlogged today.
Thanks. Can you fax it to my office? Thank you, Doc. Sure can.
Thank you, Doc. Sure can.
Diskant, talk to me.
You got three different calibers, that means three weapons.
What's your take on what went down in that market?
Two bad guys come in the front door to rob the place.
One of them sees the clerk, cuts him in half.
The other one sees Washington,
whose weapon is already drawn, empties his clip into him.
His buddy joins the party till he runs dry.
And one of them pulls a two-incher,
pumps a final "fuck you" round into Washington's back.
They leave, you show up
They leave, you show up after they're gone.
You got it all figured out.
I got your back here, but you got to keep your distance and let me work this case.
No one's gonna find these assholes. Is that what you need to hear from me?
Are you fucking kidding me?
They get a pass, you get a pass. That's the deal, right?
What are you talking about, the shooters get a pass?
I don't understand, Clady said you were on board.
Not with this.
What's the deal, are you throwing this case for a promotion?
If I were you, I'd be more worried about yourself.
Hey, you piece of shit! You got a 187 on a peace officer
and you're fucking letting the suspects walk!
That doesn't piss you off? You want these guys found?
That doesn't piss you off? You want these guys found? Doesn't it piss you off? So they can put you at the store?
Doesn't it piss you off? So they can put you at the store? Place you at the store before the shooting?
Place you at the store before the shooting? You want to catch a felony for obstruction?
You want to catch a felony for obstruction? If I say you weren't there, you weren't there.
This is your mess and I'm cleaning it up.
Yeah, it pisses me off! (CELL PHONE RINGING)
Diskant.
Yeah.
Yes. Hang on one second.
All right, go ahead.
All right, thank you. Bye-bye.
Fremont and Coates.
Fremont and Coates. The lab found saliva on a cigarette butt and the bandana outside the store.
DNA corresponds to those two names.
Congratulations, you IDed the shooters.
Yeah. Normally, I'd be pretty happy.
Pull their rap sheets. Give me copies.
I'll see you around.
Computer says you arrested these guys.
Fremont and Coates.
Good guys. Say hi for me.
You remember them?
Who can forget? Heroin dealers with a taste for blood.
Came up from Belize to make a sale and they liked the Southland so much,
they never left.
they never left. Yeah. We hooked these two fine gentlemen on a rape-mutilation caper.
Seems they had a three-day hostage-fest with this cute little Guatemalan chick
that they snatched up when she was walking home from dental school.
They hurt her bad.
Then why are they on the street? SANTOS: They walked from the beef.
One of our own felt we violated Mr. Coates' and Mr. Fremont's civil rights and told the City Attorney.
Mr. Coates' and Mr. Fremont's civil rights and told the City Attorney.
Washington dimed you out? Yep.
Why do you think they put the dude in Community Relations?
Are you shitting me?
Washington kicked loose the very guys who whacked him?
Damn ironic, isn't it?
Oh, guys! What is this, a garage sale?
How you doing, Lud? What's this? Why...
Lud, why do you have this?
Those are the shitbags who popped Washington.
Sarge, we can get these guys.
No, no. Not if you want to keep your badge.
Besides, these two animals? These guys, they'll take care of each other.
They'll be dead by the end of the week.
They'll be dead by the end of the week. Probably shoot each other's fucking faces off, knowing these two.
Probably shoot each other's fucking faces off, knowing these two.
You know how that shit works. This week's suspects, next week's victims, right?
Yeah, right.
What the hell are you doing here, Tom?
Let's talk.
I'm sick of this shit, man.
It's the same damn song for three years.
Crying about your wife.
She's gone, Tom.
What's it gonna take to bring you back from Mars?
Have I ever asked you for anything?
You know what? You ask me for shit all the time.
Big things, Jack. Important things.
What's up, Tom?
Give me a green light to take out the assholes who did Washington.
Come on, Jack. King's X.
What the hell is this?
I can lay them out like I did those Koreans, but off the books.
I'm talking shovels and trash bags. Who's gonna know? Who's gonna care?
The Koreans?
That... That was business.
This? This is some crazy bullshit rattling around in that drunk-ass mind of yours.
Look at yourself! Look at yourself, Tom! You're a mess!
When did you start drinking today?
Your little airplane bottles of vodka?
And you drove over here intoxicated. You want a second DUI?
No one's going to fuck with me, Jack! You're not listening to me!
You're not listening to me!
No, you listen to me!
This is much bigger than that.
Do you think Biggs is stupid?
He's got a PhD in catching cops slipping.
You know this. You know all this.
You got to hold your mud.
Can you do that?
It's time to turn the page and close the book.
They took $200?
I... I forgot about it till I saw this.
That's the man.
That's him.
He took all my pay. Said it was for the cookie jar.
The cookie jar? That's what he said.
That's what he said. (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
I'll be right back.
What do you want, Disco?
Washington was dirty. He was a piece of shit.
Why are you telling me this?
I think you know why.
I know why.
Are you recording this, huh? That's a new phone.
You working for Internal Affairs?
You made one deal.
Maybe you made two.
Captain Biggs flip you to the dark side, punk?
You know what?
They're right about you.
You are fucking out there.
From now on, you stay away from me. We don't talk.
All right, hold on, Disco. Hold on. Hold on.
I gotta watch my own back these days, you know?
Come on. Don't be mad.
Washington was dirty.
Hit me, princess.
Go on.
A couple things.
You know we found $50,000 in cash on him at the store.
No, I didn't. That's a lot of cash, but not in itself damning.
Oh, but this is.
Looks like an evidence tag.
I found it in Washington's truck.
I had SID scan it. Corresponds to a kilo of heroin.
Guess who comes along and signs out the dope?
Washington?
Washington signed out heroin and returned brown sugar.
The guys who whacked him moved dope.
You know, Washington sprung them from a rape beef on a technicality.
No, I did not know that. Maybe they had a business arrangement.
Maybe it was a hit.
That would explain the heavy artillery.
Washington deserved it, right?
He was dirty, so fuck him.
I feel much better about the suspects walking.
And you, you must feel better too, right?
We're doing the right thing.
No shame if you want to take your pass.
This has to be you and me.
Why do you think we're in the goddamn bathroom?
This is it. Last known address. (DOGS BARKING)
Okay.
A family here now. Our boys are long gone.
All right, Disco.
See those yahoos? I'm going to jam them.
And when I do, one of them is gonna bolt. That's the one that's dirty.

Mrs. Washington.
Can we talk outside?
Terrence had 50,000 in cash on him.
His death might be more than just wrong place, wrong time.
Might be?
How many people knew he was talking to Internal Affairs?
My husband had a good heart.
And when he started listening to it, he became a pariah.
His eyes opened.
When will your eyes open?
Terrence always said you were the worst one.
Because with all the shit going on around you, you choose not to see.
Look, I came here to help you. Help me? You came to help yourself sleep at night.
Help me? You came to help yourself sleep at night.
That 50,000, you think Terrence was stupid?
He knew he had a bull's-eye on his back the second he went to Captain Biggs.
So we sold our house.
We were leaving Friday for the Bahamas.
To start over.
Silly of us, wasn't it?
Anything else, Detective?
No.
(LAUGHS) Luds!
What the fuck?
Hey. How's Complaints? Oh. She was here? That's cute. Just missed your wife.
Oh. She was here? That's cute. Just missed your wife. Yeah.
I got something for you.
That's for you.
That's it. Is that it?
Yeah. That's it.
You keep it. A nice little souvenir for yourself.
But, Tom, this is...
I mean, it's over.

It's this OG dude. Sell a little of this, little of that.
Drive an old-ass Cadillac.
Name. They call him Scribble. Scribble.
His real name's Winston or some shit. I don't know.
Man, get me up out of here. It's on its way.
DISKANT: I can't believe this shit worked.
Scribble. It's catchy.
I got a Metro unit tailing him.
Go get him, Disco.
You're not coming? Make me proud.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Watch it! Watch it! You married, Diskant?
Engaged. And I'd like to see her again.
Hey, you ever hear of something called the "cookie jar",
in reference to corruption, shakedowns, Serpico shit?
No. Why?
A complaint I'm working on.
OFFICER ON RADIO: We're eastbound on Vernon passing Fig. Do you want us to jam them?
That's a negative. Just keep eyes on and call it out. We're en route.

You're just a rung on a ladder I'm climbing.
What ladder, man?
How do I find Fremont and Coates?
Look, I ain't got no love for them banana boat motherfuckers, man.
But them dudes are straight monsters.
They'll put me in a box if they think I'm snitching.
I'm not asking to finger the guys in open court. I just want to find them.
Once I do, you're out of the mix.
I ain't seen them in a week, man.
You got a number?
No, I ain't got no number. Them dudes drop phones all the time.
They call me, man.
Look man, your man making me nervous back here. Could you...
Look at me. Look at me!
You wanna see that judge or you gonna help me find them?
Look, I did business with them one time in El Sereno.
Little bitty-ass house way up in the hills. That's it.
Show me.
You expect me to leave my car in the hood, man?
Someone had a party.
Smell that?
Want me to put it out?
No. Get the murder book.
This is Fremont.
And this is his buddy, Coates.
We found them.
Great.
Case closed.
These guys have been here a while. There's no way they killed Washington.
You think?
Fuck you. I'm doing my best.
If Fremont and Coates didn't kill Washington, who did?
Who're we chasing?
The assholes who smoked these guys,
The assholes who smoked these guys, harvested their DNA and planted it in the market. That's who.
harvested their DNA and planted it in the market. That's who. I'm with you. But why do you frame two dead dudes?
We're going to ask them.
Let's go.
What's up, man?
You know there's coyotes out here and shit, right?
Y'all been gone a minute.
You know these guys?
No, man. I ain't never seen these dudes.
Look, if Fremont and Coates call you, set up a meeting.
You tell them I can do for them what Washington can't anymore.
They'll know what you mean.
All right, man. I'll hook it up.
Will you take me back to my car? Sure.
Have a nice swim? Yeah.
(CHATTERING) WANDER: I hope you guys are playing nice with the new girl.
I take care of him. Is Tom taking care of you?
GRACE: Yeah. WANDER: Yeah?
How's Complaints, Lud? ALL: Oh!
(ALL LAUGHING) I'd rather scrape up body parts at a traffic collision.
See, Tommy falls apart when he's not chasing bad guys. He's always been like that.
He was born without the fear gene. I could tell you some stories.
He was born without the fear gene. I could tell you some stories. Tell me! No, no, we don't kiss and tell around here.
No, no, we don't kiss and tell around here. Now, I got the classic Tom Ludlow story.
When he was a rookie, I took him under my wing.
It was a Friday night, and we're in Crip City, it's a project in Watts.
Lots of dope, shootings, whatever, what have you.
So, we get this call to shut down this house party.
And Tom, he's like the saltiest boot ever,
so I figured, you know, let's... Let's give him a lesson in humility.
So I send him in there. Alone.
Alone.
(LAUGHING) And all of a sudden, all hell breaks loose, right?
They got guys coming out the doors, homeboys flying out the windows...
Everybody's screaming inside.
I rush in, I charge in, and there's Tom, busting heads.
They wouldn't turn the music down.
Tom's always gonna be Tom. He's like a guided missile.
Tom's always gonna be Tom. He's like a guided missile. Locks on, that's it.

Fremont and Coates, or whoever they are, want to meet us.
When? Tonight.
I'll see you in Vice in an hour.
I know it's late. I'm sorry.
I wanted you to have this.
And that is?
It's the video of your husband's murder.
It shows everything.
Why are you doing this?
Because I know how not knowing hurts.
When I lost my wife, she was with another man.
She had a blood clot in her brain and it burst.
The bastard dumped her outside a hospital and...
She died alone on the sidewalk.
Linda, I'm sorry for wanting to hurt Terrence
and I'm sorry for your loss.
I want you to know he didn't die alone,
and that the men who killed him are gonna pay.
That won't bring him back.
And that won't bring your wife back.
I don't care.
Not in my name.
Please. Not in my name.
Blood doesn't wash away blood.
Shouldn't we roll with backup?
Fuck backup. What? Why?
What do you think is gonna happen tonight?
You think I'm gonna throw the cuffs on these boys,
drag them back to the barn and write it up?
Here's the deal.
I'm going out there and you're going home.
And we are never, ever gonna discuss any of this again.
What? What do you mean?
It means Fremont and Coates never existed, and we never met.
I'm not going home tonight, Tom.
Look, Paul.
This thing you want, that you think you want, you don't want.
You don't know who I am or what I want.
Who are you to judge me?
You want to be a gunfighter, huh?
Then let's do it.
Back on the night watch, Tom?
You two keep being seen all over town.
Tom?
Did you really think I was gonna do nothing about you?
If you are gonna do something, do it now.
I know you want my scalp nailed to your wall.
But then who's gonna go where the law won't?
You, Captain?
You? You going to clean up the needles and baby parts?
No. You need me.
All you company men, you hate me, but you need me.
(SIGHS) Ludlow,
maybe you're right. Maybe we do need you.
But goddamn if you don't need me, son.
Hey, Detective.
Did you ever ask yourself if Washington's dead because he was dirty
or because he came clean?
Swap your rounds out.
We don't want the coroner digging department-issue ammo out of these assholes.
Use the gloves.
Jesus. These are some serious manstoppers.
So we're just gonna go in there and kill them?
No. I'm gonna ask them some questions.
Then we're gonna kill them.
Fucking time, man.

You know it's some bullshit, right? These dudes is monsters, man.

Or is everybody out for theirs?
Everyone's out for theirs. Way of the world.
Dude, cops are like weeds.
You pull one out,

Well, Washington got greedy.
Don't shoot me now.
I'm just gonna get something out of my pocket.

Did you figure it out, Lud? Huh? How did Fremont and Coates make it to the market that day?
After Washington got them kicked loose, you picked them back up.
Took them to the hills and popped their melons, right?
You should be a detective. We took some DNA samples first.
Got a little hair, little spit. Voila! Fremont and Coates did it.
Who signed out the dope? It wasn't Washington.
You.
They were gonna incinerate it.
They were gonna incinerate it. Might as well sell and make a dollar out of it, you know?
For you or the cookie jar?
You're not that smart, Santos. Who was in? Silky? Clady?
Who was in? Silky? Clady?
Wander.
Wander.
It's a Wander caper all the way.
He's the only one who could pull those strings.
He should have pulled your string years ago.
We couldn't figure out why the fuck he kept you around all this time.
Man, he's Jack's little pet.
Been doing the man's dirty missions for years.
Washington wasn't giving me up to Biggs.
He was giving up the big dog. He was giving up the king.
Wander played your fool ass,  puto. We all have.
You're a fucking chump, bro.
Washington's killers, they really cops?
Yeah, they were.
Yeah, they were. Couple of deputies from the ghetto having the time of their lives.

First, we bag your hair, saliva and blood.
When they find Linda Washington's corpse,
guess whose DNA's gonna be all over it?
And what is it gonna look like?
Like you finally snapped, just like everyone knew you would.
That little nurse of yours, Lud?
You know, I'm popping a hundred milli Viagra
and I'm gonna work that little brown ass.
Then I'm gonna break her neck.

Homeboy's gonna bury himself.
Just do the fucking puto and let's go.

You're getting ahead of yourself.
We're gonna be here all night. (CRASH)
You have to go, Linda. Wherever it is, you gotta go.
Come on.
I'm already packed.
Take care of yourself, Detective.
Where are you gonna go, cop killer?
I let myself in.
Clearly.
You all right, Tom? I was worried about you.
Apparently, I killed two deputies. Diskant's dead.
Santos and DeMille dragged me off to die, so I put them down.
Can you fix this, Jack?
Oh, I'm going to fix it. I'm going to fix it.
You know, I suspected that Santos and DeMille were capering with Washington,
were capering with Washington,
but I didn't want to believe this kind of shit was going on in my unit.
Yeah. Me neither.
Boss, you better get Clady up here. I need you guys.
I'll get him in the loop.
I'm gonna get him up here right now. You need an alibi.
You were sleeping on the couch after the party.
Santos and DeMille, they killed those deputies.
Not you. Not you.
This is Clady's phone.
And his badge.
All this is you. It's you, Jack.
It's you. It's you, Tom.
Own it! Fucking own it!
You knew they were cops!
Those guys were so deep undercover
that they... They lost their fucking minds!
Don't mourn them. You can't mourn them.
You set me up! You sent me in to die, Jack!
I didn't set you up! You set yourself up!
I was trying to save you! You backed me up in a fucking corner!
You killed Washington! Fuck him!
Fuck Santos! Fuck DeMille! Fuck Clady! Fuck them all!
Fuck Clady! Fuck them all! Fuck them all!
They're a dime a dozen.
You... You, man.
You're special.
You're special to me.
And Diskant?
He special?
I watched a good man die because of you.
That is entirely
your fault.
Come on, Tom.
How do we get past this?
We got a destiny. You and me.
Nobody's getting past this, Jack.
Everything ends now. You end now.
(PANTING) I surrender! I surrender.
Hook me and book me!
There's a rover right there!
Put it out! One for transport!
Goddamn! Tom Ludlow, he got his man now!
I found you.
I made you possible.
Now you need me more than ever, Tom.
What did you think I'd do when I found out?
Wait, man. Wait.
Wait.
My wall.
It's all there. In the wall.
These secrets, they're killing us.
That's it. Open it up.
Open it up! Tear it down!
Tear it down!
That's it.
There it is.
This
is my power.
This is my crown.
I'm the king of secrets, Tom!
I know which city councilman is doing lines.
I know who likes boys. I know who's selling contracts.
I know who... Who's beating his wife.
I own them! Even the Chief is in my pocket, Tom.
How do you think that I've been able to protect you all these years?
What do you think it is that you're doing?
All these missions,
how do you think that you're able to touch the untouchables?
I'm gonna be chief!
I will be chief!
I will be mayor!
This is our world, Tom!
So, let's take it!
That why you put a hit on Washington?
Why you tried to kill me?
So you can keep stuffing money in your wall?
But this is our money.
The unit's.
Who do you think paid for Silky's defense during all those lawsuits?
Who's gonna pay for your retirement?
I'm just correcting a flaw in the system, Tom.
This is about cops helping cops.
And if a teacher or a fireman could do it,
they would do it, too.
What happened to just locking up bad people?
We're all bad, Tom.
You were my best friend.
We were family.
(GUN COCKING) OFFICER: Drop it, Ludlow!
There's been enough killing.
I came as soon as you called.
Guess you're first on scene.
Nope. You are.
Looks like Jack's friends got greedy and came after the money.
Mmm-hmm. Is that what it looks like?
This is your plan, Captain?
Just sit back and let us all kill each other?
You were the plan.
No one else could touch him.
Once your eyes were opened, there was no other outcome.
Decisions were made, Tom,
by powerful men with powerful secrets. Captain.
They were afraid of Jack.
They asked me to help.
One day, you will pass the Chief in the hall and he will give you a nod.
And you will know why.
Lucinda, we're going in.
Lucinda!
Lucinda, we're going in.
Now, you remember tomorrow is our official opening day, don't you?
- Yes, Miss Taylor. - Yes, Miss Taylor.
And you remember Principal Clark ran a competition last month...
And you remember Principal Clark ran a competition last month... ...to find the best ideas to celebrate this very special day.
- Me! Me! Me! - Me! Me! Me!
Well, yesterday, the staff selected the winning idea...
...and it came from this class.
The winner is our own...
...Lucinda Embry. - Lucinda? - Why her?
- Lucinda? - Lucinda? Come on, everyone.
We'll be closing our dedication ceremony with the burial of a time capsule.
- Yes? - What's a time capsule?
This is a time capsule. - Wow. - That's incredible.
Now, I need you to put your thinking caps on...
...because I want each of you to draw... ...what you think the future is going to look like.
...what you think the future is going to look like. Then we'll put the pictures in the capsule, and 50 years from today...
...a group of children just like yourselves will open it up to see what you drew.
Doesn't that sound exciting? - Yes, Miss Taylor. - Yes, Miss Taylor.
- Yes, Miss Taylor. - Yes, Miss Taylor. Let's begin.
That is a lovely spaceship there, Dawn. - Thank you, Miss Taylor. - Well done.
- Thank you, Miss Taylor. - Well done. And that is a nice robot, Andrew. Very good.
Time's up. Everyone hand your work in.
And make sure you write your name on the envelope.
My name's over here.
Thank you, Harold. Thank you, Miss Taylor.
Lucinda, you need to finish up now. - Thank you. - Thank you.
Oh, Lucinda.
The assignment was to draw a picture.
This was your idea.
Ok, I want you all to finish, please.
Welcome to all our friends and esteemed colleagues.
We, the students and faculty of William Dawes Elementary...
...hereby bury this time capsule in dedication of our new school...
...and we charge our descendants... ...to open this vault of history 50 years from today.
...to open this vault of history 50 years from today.
To the future and the promise that it holds.
Lucinda?
Lucinda? I am certain Lucinda is simply being over curious.
Can you please help find her?
The cloakroom. Check the cloakroom. Lucinda. Henry, come on.
- Lucinda? - Come on out now.
Lucinda?
Lucinda.
Oh, my God.
Make them stop. Please make them stop whispering.
Caleb? Take a look at this.
There you go.
What is it? Saturn's rings await your approval.
Has anyone found life on other planets? Not yet. Guess it's just us for now.
Not yet. Guess it's just us for now.
Ok. Then how many that might have life?
Well, if you count the number of stars similar to our sun in this galaxy...
...then you factor in the probability that they have Earth-like planets orbiting them...
There are 10 million possible worlds... ...with four million mature enough for life to evolve.
...with four million mature enough for life to evolve.
Why do you even ask? Just making sure if you're listening.
- Where are you going? - To watch that Discovery program.
But it's Dad's famous Sunday night hot dogs on the run... ...time.
I can't consume that. I've decided to become a vegetarian.
Well, when were you planning on telling the guy... ...who buys the groceries around here?
Are you deaf? I just told you now, Dad.
- Off. - No, it's almost over.
You're not going to be able to concentrate in class tomorrow.
I don't have class tomorrow. It's the 50th anniversary, remember?
I remember.
Caleb...
...when I said it was just us out there...
...you know I was talking about space, right?
I didn't mean heaven, or anything. - I am sure wherever Mom is-- - Dad, you don't even believe in heaven.
- I am sure wherever Mom is-- - Dad, you don't even believe in heaven.
I never said that, Caleb.
I just said we can't know for sure, that's all.
If you want to believe, you go ahead and believe, ok?
Ok. Bedtime.
Hey, you and me...
- ...together forever. - Forever.
I love you. I love you, too.
We're going to pose a topic...
...to get you thinking along the right lines for your term paper.
It's the subject of randomness versus determinism in the universe.
Who's jumping in? Jessica?
Determinism says that occurrences in nature... ...are causally decided by preceding events or natural laws...
...are causally decided by preceding events or natural laws...
...that everything leading up to this point has happened for a reason.
That's right. That's what determinism says.
Spencer? Tell me something about the sun.
It's hot.
Elaborate.
Temperature's about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit on the surface.
- 27 million degrees at the core. - Good.
Stacey?
A word or two about the composition.
Mostly hydrogen. Also helium with some carbon and nitrogen thrown in there.
Also helium with some carbon and nitrogen thrown in there. Excellent. Now, I want you to think about the perfect set of circumstances...
Excellent. Now, I want you to think about the perfect set of circumstances...
...that put this celestial ball of fire...
...at just the correct distance... ...from our little blue planet for life to evolve...
...from our little blue planet for life to evolve...
...making it possible for you to be sitting here in this riveting lecture.
But that's a nice thought, right?
Everything has a purpose, an order to it, is determined.
But then there's the other side of the argument...
...the theory of randomness, which says it's all simply coincidence.
The very fact we exist is nothing but the result of a complex...
The very fact we exist is nothing but the result of a complex... ...yet inevitable string of chemical accidents...
...and biological mutations.
There is no grand meaning.
There's no purpose.
What about you, Professor Koestler?
- What? - Well, what do you believe?
I think shit just happens.
But that's me. Class dismissed.
Now, that's some very heavy shit for a Monday morning, by the sounds of it.
Since when does the cosmology department audit my lectures?
Since my esteemed colleague in astrophysics owes me a latte.
So what's on your scientific mind today?
Do you remember Kim's little sister? Ph-double D's? Remember her?
Is it ethical to say things like that about your sister-in-law? What? It's factual. It's peer-reviewed. I mean, it's like... Anyway, whatever.
What? It's factual. It's peer-reviewed. I mean, it's like... Anyway, whatever.
- She's in town this Friday. - Ok.
And she thinks that you're intriguing, which I thought was code for gay... ...but apparently not because she's asked if you would join us for dinner.
...but apparently not because she's asked if you would join us for dinner.
- Yeah, I... I don't know, Phil. - Come on, John.
Come on, you owe me for last time you skipped out on me.
Come on, you owe me for last time you skipped out on me. - Caleb was panicking. - Yeah, look, I know.
And the time before that, he had a sore throat. - Oh, no. - What?
- Damn it! Damn it! - What? Caleb's ceremony. I am sorry, Phil.
Hey! Hey! Friday! I'll think about it!
- "This little light of mine." - "This little light of mine." - "I am going to let it shine." - "I am going to let it shine." - "This little light of mine." - "This little light of mine."
Fifty years ago, the students and faculty of William Dawes Elementary...
...imagined what the future might hold.
...imagined what the future might hold. Today, we unveil their legacy.
Now, I'd like to introduce you to someone very special...
...Miss Priscilla Taylor.
Since Miss Taylor was there for the original dedication...
...it's only fitting that we have her do the honors today.
You almost forgot again. I made it in time to hear you sing.
You were the best one up there. - You could not hear me. - I could. I swear.
- You could not hear me. - I could. I swear.
Got to go. They're starting!
All right, easy, easy! No pushing. Everyone is going to receive an envelope.
Open them gently now. They're very old.
Hey, what'd you get?
Boring. Everyone else got a picture.
Caleb, could you please watch where you put this?
I don't want you to lose another one.
It's making funny noises. Try turning the volume down.
Hey, Dad? You know that kid, Jason, from soccer practice?
Mmm-hmm. He's having a sleepover this weekend, and he was wondering if I can come.
He's having a sleepover this weekend, and he was wondering if I can come. Sounds like fun.
Sounds like fun. They have a boat.
Jason's dad said he might take us out on the lake.
I'll think about it. - That means no. - It means I'll think about it.
- That means no. - It means I'll think about it.
What are you doing with this?
You weren't supposed to bring this home. It belongs to the school.
But maybe it means something, like a math puzzle or something like that.
Yeah, that's good, I don't know, but it's not ours to keep.
Now, you return this as soon as you get to school tomorrow. Got it?
Ok, let's go. Bedtime.
Goodnight, baby.
Goodnight, Mom.
9-11-01.
"In memory of the 2996 lives that were lost that day."
Two thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six.
Come on.
What the hell is this?
Dad?
Dad, we're going to be late!
Thanks for the ride, Mr. Koestler.
Dad, are you sick?
I am fine. Don't you think you're acting kind of awkward today?
Am I awkward? I just had a lot of work to do last night.
Ok.
- Bye, Dad. - Bye.
Look at this. - Look at the numbers beside the date. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Two thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six. Right.
That's how many people died in the attacks that day.
- Yeah. - All right, stay with me. I know how this sounds, but I've matched these numbers to the dates...
...of every major global disaster for the last 50 years in perfect sequence...
...except for three.
And these events haven't occurred yet, starting with this one.
So tomorrow, somewhere on the planet, this number string predicts...
So tomorrow, somewhere on the planet, this number string predicts... ...that 81 people are going to die in some kind of tragedy.
Whoa. I mean, have a listen to yourself. I know.
- It sounds pretty crazy. - I know. I mean, even for you.
- What's this? - Open it.
Oh! Why are you showing me this?
The day Allison died in the fire, it's on the list, too...
...from a piece of paper that's been buried in the ground for five decades.
- Yeah. - Can you explain that, Phil?
I was up all night going over this. I went through that list again and again...
...and I tried to fault it and I couldn't.
Maybe someone's playing a really shitty joke... Right! Right! Except I saw them dig it up!
Right! Right! Except I saw them dig it up!
I watched them pull the capsule out of the ground...
...and hand that sealed envelope to my kid. Ok, let me ask you this, then.
All these uncircled numbers, what do they mean?
I don't know yet. Maybe nothing. But the circled... Maybe they all mean nothing.
Ok, Phil, hey, can we just start over here?
I am not saying that 81 people are going to die tomorrow, ok?
I am just trying to understand why this is saying they will.
Ok, it's spooky, all right? I'll grant you. It's more than spooky.
But just step back, all right? You have all these uncircled numbers with no sequence to them.
You have all these uncircled numbers with no sequence to them.
I mean, numerology, kabala, Pythagorean cults...
...there are systems that find meaning in numbers...
...and they are a dime a dozen. Why?
Because people see what they want to see in them.
I mean, that's really what you think I am doing?
Yeah, I think that losing Allison has spun you off your axis a little...
...and I think it's clouded your judgment.
I am just saying it's clouded your judgment. Don't you think?
- Where are you going? - Off campus.
Yes?
But you do remember her? Oh, yes. I remember Lucinda.
She was such a sad little girl.
Would you like some iced tea? Oh, no. Thank you.
Do you remember the day your students buried the time capsule?
Oh, yes. The children were so excited.
And what about Lucinda?
That was the day we couldn't find her.
That was the day we couldn't find her. She was hiding in a closet, under the gym...
...scratching at the door with her fingernails like some kind of animal.
Scratching at the door?
- Why was she hiding? - I am not sure.
She was holding up the class writing all those silly numbers.
She was holding up the class writing all those silly numbers. I had to hurry her along.
Then we found her...
...and I knew something had frightened the poor dear...
...but we never could get her to tell us what it was.
Miss Taylor, my son got Lucinda's time capsule message.
Do you remember this? Is this what she wrote?
Oh, Professor, you are testing an old woman's memory.
- Can you believe it's been 50 years? - It's a long time.
I believe that's it.
How rude of me. I never offered you a drink. Would you like some iced tea?
I never offered you a drink. Would you like some iced tea? No, thank you. I am fine.
I thought maybe I could meet her.
Oh! I am sorry. Lucinda passed away several years ago.
I said I am Caleb Koestler's father.
I am calling to find out the names of the two janitors...
I am calling to find out the names of the two janitors... ...that pulled the time capsule out of the ground yesterday at the ceremony.
I am not sure I understand why that would be a problem for you.
Yes, sir, we're afraid that that's privileged information.
Caleb!
- Who was that? - I don't know. Just some guys.
What did he give you? Just this. Kind of cool, isn't it?
What did I say about talking to strangers?
Have you done your homework? Give me 10 more minutes of practice.
I don't want to have to ask you twice, Caleb. Come on.
Hey! Hey, stranger. At what age do we learn to knock?
I said I was going to drop by on my way to the graveyard shift, remember?
I said I was going to drop by on my way to the graveyard shift, remember? - Didn't you get my message? - I've been busy.
Can you not play with my things? - You're always busy. - Yes! Yes.
- You're always busy. - Yes! Yes.
How's my nephew? Decided to become a vegetarian.
How's my nephew? Decided to become a vegetarian. A what? - Why, you got a problem with that?
You're not feeding him Dad's famous Sunday night hot dogs again, are you?
You know, if you want someone to take him off your hands for the evening...
You know, if you want someone to take him off your hands for the evening... ...so you can go out, you know, like normal people do...
I appreciate the offer, but we're fine.
And, believe it or not, Caleb and I have got a good thing going here. - Uh-huh? - Yeah. So...
...you can report that back to headquarters.
Mom says hi. So does Dad.
Grace, don't.
I get that you don't like being the son of a pastor.
I am the son of a pastor. That's fine. You're still his son.
- Can't you let it go? - Can't he?
You know he asks after you every time I see him. - He worries about you. - He said that?
- He worries about you. - He said that?
- He doesn't have to. - Right.
You're going to have to speak to him one day, you know.
This can't go on forever. You know it's what Allison wanted...
...for Caleb to have a grandfather, and vice versa.
Ok, I am going. I am going.
By the way, Grace, how are you? How's your life? What's going on for you?
- Thank you, John, for asking. - I have to get up early in the morning.
What have you got going on? I'll say a prayer.
Please... Don't. Ok.
...with talks yet to resolve the issue. Experts say solar flares this weekend may disrupt cell phone communication...
Experts say solar flares this weekend may disrupt cell phone communication... - Experts. ...and some satellite transmissions.
...after the press conference today. The price of oil hit yet another record....
A devastating fire burns out of control in the Gulf. That story leads our headlines at the top of the hour.
That story leads our headlines at the top of the hour.
Eighty-one.
Tonight, in the Gulf of Mexico... ...an explosion on a soon-to-be decommissioned oilrig...
...triggered a fire which burned for three hours before it was extinguished.
Officials don't yet know the exact cause of the explosion...
...but believe a malfunction in the cooling system may have been at fault.
Our last run into the rig... Due to the prompt response of the rescue unit...
...the structure was evacuated with no loss of life.
Farmers across the Midwest are continuing to feel the effects of a record drought...
Across China and Southeast Asia...
And here's Carl with the weather.
- Looks like a scorcher's on the way. - That's right, Bob. The forecast shows more high pressure moving in later this week.

It seems our Indian summer is set to last a little while longer...
...so don't put away your hats and your sunscreen just yet.
...so don't put away your hats and your sunscreen just yet. Temperatures are set to reach another record high this week.
- Hello? - Dad, where are you?
You're on carpool this afternoon.
Caleb, I am so sorry.
I'll pick you up in 10 minutes. Ok? Ok. Bye.
William Dawes Elementary School, alternate route.
William Dawes Elementary School, alternate route. No alternate route available.
Hey, you've dialed Phil and Kim. We can't get to the phone right now, so please leave a message.
We can't get to the phone right now, so please leave a message. Hey, Phil, it's John.
I am sorry about yesterday. I kind of freaked out on you, didn't I?
I kind of freaked out on you, didn't I?
Well, look, I am not ready to meet anyone in any kind of special way, you know...
...but I would like to take you up on your offer for dinner.
I think it would be good for me to just, you know, get out of the house and...
The uncircled numbers are locations.
This location.
What's going on? Can we get through or what?
Hi. Is everything ok?
Hi. Is everything ok? I am sorry, sir, but you need to get back to your car.
- Anybody hurt? - A couple of injuries, but nothing serious.
Get down! Get away!
Hey! Hey!
Help me! Please! Help me!
Help me, please! Help me!
Are you ok, sir? Step back, sir. Step away.
Today we witnessed one of the worst days in recent US aviation history... ...when four planes crash-landed across as many states from Maine to Miami.
...when four planes crash-landed across as many states from Maine to Miami.
One tragically ended in disaster when Flight 74 from Pittsburgh came down...
...2 miles from the runway near Logan International Airport and exploded...
...2 miles from the runway near Logan International Airport and exploded... Can you go upstairs while I talk to your dad? No act of terrorism is expected to be involved.
...that a malfunction in the navigational systems of the planes caused the crashes... - You didn't tell him anything? - Of course not.
First estimates put the presumed dead at 81.
- Do you need to talk? - NTS is linking... ...possible navigational malfunctions...
- ...to an unprecedented level... - I just... ...of electromagnetic radiation from a series...
...of electromagnetic radiation from a series... I just want to sleep. Government officials are quick to reiterate that at this time...
What happened, Dad? What's going on?
Truck broke down on the highway.
It's more than that, isn't it?
I am going to bed.
Get your homework done.
And you should go to bed, too. No television tonight.
Why? I always watch an hour of television. No more questions, Caleb.
No more questions, Caleb. I can ask questions when you tell me things to do that don't make sense.
I can ask questions when you tell me things to do that don't make sense. You won't let me play soccer, you won't let me stay over at Jason's...
...and now you won't tell me what's going on... ...and why you're acting so weird all the time.
I am not a kid anymore.
Oh, my God. John, you... You were there?
The date, the number of dead, the GPS coordinates, lat and long.
- Why didn't I see that? - It wasn't coincidence.
I drove past at the exact moment the prediction came true.
It's not a coincidence. Ok, John, I didn't say it was.
So what are we calling this? Synchronicity?
Two unrelated events, digging up a time capsule, plane crash...
Two unrelated events, digging up a time capsule, plane crash... ...combined to create a significance for the subject, you?
I keep seeing their faces...
...burning.
Oh.
Ok, look. We're way beyond the bounds here, John.
Ok, look. We're way beyond the bounds here, John. We don't have a frame of reference. There could be multiple meanings to consider.
There could be multiple meanings to consider.
There are two disasters left.
What are you saying?
The numbers are warnings meant for me.
They might just as easily be a warning to stay away.
You could have been killed today, John. Caleb would have been orphaned...
...and you want to go put yourself back in harm's way?
Two disasters left.
Right now my scientific mind is telling me to have nothing more to do with this...
...and yours should, too.
Caleb, what's wrong? What's wrong? Dad!
It's ok. It's ok.
It's just a bad dream.
It's just a bad dream.
Hey!
Hey!
You stay away from us, you hear?
Want some of this?
Caleb, why don't you check out the dire wolf?
- I'll catch up with you, ok? - Ok.
Do you know that all wolves are born deaf? Really?
But, you know, when they get older...
...they can hear another wolf's howl from 10 miles away.
Wow. How did you know that? I read it in a National Geographic.
Hi. Is that your daughter?
- Yeah, why? - Why? That's my son...
...and they look like they're already best friends.
...and they look like they're already best friends. Yeah, Abby's probably telling him about the animals.
Even as a baby, she was completely fascinated with them.
Yeah, he's the same. He likes extinct animals.
I am John.
Hi. Diana. What are they doing now?
Caleb's showing her something in sign language.
- I am sorry. I didn't realize... - He's not.
Sounds just get jumbled up sometimes.
He has a hearing aid, which helps, but he's not deaf.
He is an expert in sign language.
I don't think it's ever been this hot in October. Air conditioner must be out.
Dad, can we get a drink? Can we get one, too?
Can we get one, too? Hey, would you and Abby like to join us?
Sure, that'd be nice.
Abby, this is John. - Hi. - Hey, Abby.
What's that over there? It can be tough sometimes, because, you know, I am by myself.
I know how you feel.
- You're a single parent, too? - Yeah.
I kicked him out years ago. He couldn't keep his hands to himself...
...so I decided he couldn't keep me to himself either.
Well, it's... It's his loss.
And you? You're separated, or...
Diana...
...we didn't meet here by accident.
I need to talk to you about something...
...ask you something about your mother.
My mother? What about my mother?
Did she have some kind of ability?
Ability?
A gift of some kind?
- Who are you? - Yeah, it's awkward. You don't know me.
I am John Koestler. I teach astrophysics at MIT.
I am John Koestler. I teach astrophysics at MIT. My son goes to William Dawes Elementary...
...which is the same school your mother went to.
Fifty years ago, she put this in a time capsule. It's a list of dates...
...events that I think she believed would happen.
...events that I think she believed would happen. Look, I don't know what any of this is about...
And I thought if I could talk to you or your father... My father's dead.
I think it's possible that there are people, like your mother, Lucinda...
I think it's possible that there are people, like your mother, Lucinda... ...who can see things before they occur.
Abby, we're leaving! Honey?
I followed one of your mother's predictions...
...and I watched 81 people burn to death in that plane crash yesterday...
...when she said it would happen, where she said it would happen...
...and there was nothing I could do about it.
She says 170 people will die tomorrow in New York City...
...and in three days' time, October 19th, 33 more.
Stay away from me and my daughter.
Abby? Let's go, honey. Come on.
Stay right there. Diana?
Stay right there. Diana? Diana, I think this has something to do with my son. Get in there, honey.
I don't know how, or why, but I think he's in danger.
So I am asking you please, please help us.
I can't.
...in response to an FBI warning of a possible terrorist plot.
The Department of Homeland Security raised the national threat level...
...from elevated to high after intelligence reports suggested...
...an attack on a major East Coast city may be imminent.
Police have urged citizens to stay vigilant.
FBI New York, how may I direct your call?
The attack will take place tomorrow at the corner of Lafayette and Worth Streets.
Cordon off the area from midnight. Are you clear on that?
Cordon off the area from midnight. Are you clear on that? Sir, let me patch you through to our agents...
Please! Do exactly as I say or many people will die.
This is not a crank call.
You said you'd take him off my hands.
I know there's something you're not telling me.
Don't let him watch the news.
Why hasn't this intersection been sealed off?
Excuse me? I said why hasn't this intersection been sealed off?
Didn't you get the tip-off about the attack? Sir. Sir, please calm down.
If you'll accompany me, we'll get this matter taken care of.
Sir, stop! - Hey, man. - Stop!
Suspect sighted. Platform three.
Out of the way! Let me through! Forward car.
- Get off the train. - Why? What's wrong?
Just take the baby and get off the train. What's your problem?
Hold it right there, sir.
Transit police. I am asking you to stop!
That's him! You have to stop him!
Transit police. Turn around.
Now! Put your hands up!
Please! Please, I won't do it again, I promise! I'll give them back!
I'll give them back! I'll give them back.
Move back! Move back!

And NO AA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration...
...remains silent tonight.
But with the devastating subway crash in Manhattan...
...power cuts in Long Island and two more emergency...
Grace. I got held up by work. I'll be over in 30 minutes.
No, I am fine. I'll see you in 30 minutes.
Caleb, go inside.
- Hey. - Hi. - Want to check out the house? - Sure.
You said October 19th?
My mother used to talk about that day all the time.
She said it was the day I was going to die.
All my life I've had this thing hanging over my head...
...and Abby's.
I just don't believe anyone can predict my future.
And what does it matter, anyway?
We all die in the end.
I don't want to know what my future holds.
Last year, my wife was on a business trip to Phoenix...
...a few days before my birthday...
...and a fire started in her hotel at 4:00 in the morning.
The investigators said that Allison died of smoke inhalation.
Died in her sleep.
She wouldn't have known anything about it.
While she was dying, I was at home, in the front yard.
I always thought you were supposed to sense...
...when the people you love are in danger...
...but I didn't feel anything.
Nothing.
I was just blowing leaves off the lawn.
I am so sorry, John.
Well, but my point is that from then on...
...I decided that no one can know what was coming...
...and life was just a string of random accidents and mistakes.
And then I got that list.
If that had come to me before Allison left, I would have saved her life.
I need to know.
It's still here.
What's this?
Have you seen this?
Abby used to do this sometimes, write things backwards...
...and that last number, I don't think it's 33.
It's EE.
EE? Initials. Someone she knew?
I don't know.
I was nine when she overdosed.
The only time I ever came out here was with my father...
...when he identified her body.
She willed the property to me...
...but I never came back for any of her things.
When I was little, my mother used to tell me that she could hear voices...
...whispering to her...
...telling her horrible things.
And then one day, my dad came and took me away from her.
He said she was sick.
She said she moved out here to get ready.
I never knew what she meant by that.
I made this for her one Christmas.
I never knew she kept it.
She used to stare at this picture for hours.
That's where they found her.
In there.
Have you seen enough?
Yeah. Ok. We'll go.
Abby?
Abby?
EE isn't just one person.
Abby, no!
Abby!
What? What? What? It's ok. It's ok.
They were here.
Who? Who was here, Caleb?
- Did they hurt you? - No. They were talking to us.
What did they say? I don't know. They were all talking at once.
They said we could go with them, if we chose to.
- Who did, baby? Who? - The whisper people.
Hey, lock the doors.
What do you want with my son?
Answer me!
I just know they've been following us for days.
I think someone's been following me and Abby, too.
That's why she didn't write any coordinates down after the final date.
There isn't a single location this time.
Are you telling me that my mother could see the end of everything?
That we're all going to die tomorrow?
She was disturbed, John. She could've just made it all up.
She's been right so far, Diana.
About everything.
Abby's... Abby's all I've got, John.
I can't let anything happen to her.
Caleb, you really need to sleep.
I can hear them whispering to me sometimes like Abby can.
Could Lucinda hear them, too?
Yeah, I think she did. Yes.
Are me and Abby going to die?
No. I will never let that happen, Caleb.
Do you hear me? Never.
You...
Abby, what do you like to eat for breakfast?
Abby?
What are you doing, honey?
It's the sun.
There's something I need to check. Get Abby, you're coming with us.
Caleb!
Ok. All right. Hey, John, what happened?
Hey!
Talk to me. What happened?
I've been calling you off the hook ever since I heard about the subway.
John?
Do you remember that paper on extra-solar activity I published?
Yeah, sure, I remember.
I found evidence of a series of super-flares from a star in the outer-Pleiades region.
Right. Ratings were off the chart.
We were both wrong. The numbers are a warning...
...but not just to me or any random group.
They're a warning to everyone.
Ok. You're officially scaring the shit out of me right now.
The super-flare, in our own solar system.
A 100 microtesla wave of radiation... ...that would destroy our ozone layer, killing every living organism on the planet.
...that would destroy our ozone layer, killing every living organism on the planet.
We have to let everyone know. We have to call the NOAA.
They already know. The announcement will come anytime now.
I thought there was some purpose to all of this.
Why did I get this prediction if there's nothing I can do about it?
How am I supposed to stop the end of the world?
Go home, Phil. Be with Kim tonight.
Diana.
I am so stupid.
I've spent my whole life knowing she was right...
...and pretending that she was insane.
If we hide underground, we've got a chance, don't we?
It's possible.
I know some caves off Route 40 past Groton.
I know some caves off Route 40 past Groton. Hardly anyone knows about them, but I used to play there as a child.
Hardly anyone knows about them, but I used to play there as a child.
We could try there, right?
- Ok. - Ok.
Caleb, put some clothes and shoes into your backpack.
Diana, load all the non-perishable food, any water you can, into the truck.
Diana, load all the non-perishable food, any water you can, into the truck. Let's try to be out of here in 10 minutes.
- You start. I'll get some bags. - Yeah.
Allison wanted me to call you...
...the day she left for Phoenix.
She wanted me to promise her that I'd call you.
I know, Jonathan.
We haven't spoken in so long, I don't really even know why anymore.
I need to tell you something.
Yes?
That sermon you preached every year at Pentecost, about the gifts of the Spirit...
...one was the gift of prophecy.
1 Corinthians 12. Yes, I remember it. The church should respect the prophet.
I have a prophecy.
It's about to be proven accurate.
I need you to respect it and receive it as the truth.
This heat we're experiencing isn't going to get better.
It's going to get worse, much worse.
I need you to get Mom and Grace and any supplies you can...
...and get below ground tonight. The basement, the sewer, the T.
Just get as deep as you can and as fast as you can.
And that will keep us safe from this heat?
I don't know that, but we have to try, right?
I am sorry, John, but I am afraid I am not going anywhere tonight or any night.
I appreciate your concern, but if it's my time, it's my time.
I am ready whenever the good Lord calls me.
Are you?
- Dad? - Hello?
- John? - Dad?
Caleb, let's go!
Caleb.
Caleb.
Caleb!
Caleb, stop!
- Caleb! - Huh? Huh?
What were you doing?
Did I do that?
This isn't the way to the highway.
Everybody wait here.
John!
John!
John, please, why are we back here?
John, please, what are you doing? We have to get to the caves.
- We're not going to the caves. - What?
- We're not going to the caves. - What? She knew the coordinates for this last event.
She tried to write them down.
The teacher said she was interrupted, ran out of time...
...so she scratched them into this door.
She tried to tell us where to go.
You're not making any sense. Look at you. Look at what you're doing!
The numbers are the key to everything.
Please! Please, John, we need to leave!
We're taking my car. Come on. Let's go. Keep your bags with you.
Be here, please, be here.
Throw it in the back.
What about Dad?
He's just got to finish what he's doing. He's going to follow us.
We're just getting a head start, ok?
Diana?
Caleb!
Caleb!
Caleb!
Caleb!
Where are we going, Mom?
Are we hiding from the whisper people?
Yes, baby. They won't find us where we're going.
Mom, they know where we are.
- How do you know that? - They told us so.
- You've seen them again? - No. They just talk to us.
How, Abby? How do they talk to you?
They whisper into our heads.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. - I want to call my dad. - The phones are down!
I promise he's right behind us! We'll call him when we get there!
Wait right here!
Number five.
...and that the dollar will continue its long slide... This is an Emergency Broadcast Transmission.
This is not a test. This is an Emergency Broadcast Transmission.
- Today, NO AA has concluded... - Turn that up!
...the solar flares may last longer...
...and cause more damage to our infrastructure than we originally thought.
We're recommending that people stay indoors until further notice.
Bring your pets inside. Stock up on extra water and, if possible...
Bring your pets inside. Stock up on extra water and, if possible... ...seek out fortified underground shelter.
- General, what time is it happening? - General, excuse me...
The shelters we have are currently overwhelmed.
The best advice we can offer the public is to seek your own.
One more question about the warning. We are assessing this information as it becomes available.
It was only recently confirmed.
Where is the President?
The President and his staff... ...are currently being transported to a secure location.
- Hello? - Dad?
Caleb, are you ok? Tell me exactly where you are.
We're at a gas station. I don't know where.
The damage information regarding the destructive power of these flares...
...is a scientific matter, and I am not going to speculate... Are you coming with us?
Caleb, get back to the car now.
- Caleb? - John?
- Where are you? - We're in Westford.
- Where are you? - We're in Westford. I am sorry. I had to do this for Abby and for Caleb.
- I am taking them to the caves. - I found the numbers!
They're the location of your mother's mobile home.
They're the location of your mother's mobile home. That's where we've got to go.
- Don't do this to me. Please. - I know how it sounds.
- Don't do this to me. Please. - I know how it sounds. You want us to head toward the place where this is supposed to happen?
You want us to head toward the place where this is supposed to happen?
Are you insane? It's a chance we got to take or we're all going to die!
Stay where you are! I'll be right there!
No! If we go to the caves, we have a chance!
You said the sun can't reach that far!
You said the sun can't reach that far! The caves won't save us! Nothing can!
The radiation will penetrate a mile into the Earth's crust! Do you hear me?
Our only shot is to go where the numbers want us to go.
- It's what we're meant to do! - No, I don't believe you!
I am taking the children! We have to save the children!
Don't you move, Diana! Caleb is my son, and I'll decide where he goes!
Diana! Caleb! Are you there?
Abby!
Abby! Abby!
Help! Somebody took my daughter!
Abby!
Damn it!
Where did she go?
Everyone needs to do this immediately.
We are facing a natural threat of global proportions...
...and there is very little that this government...
Same thing happened with Y2K.
They are going to wake up tomorrow morning feeling pretty stupid.
Thirty minutes ago there was a woman here. She was screaming!
She was with a kid! He was on your pay phone! He's a nine-year-old kid!
Some guy took the lady's car with the kids inside. Drove right off with it.
- The woman, where'd she go? - That way!
Go lock the door! Stop that, you crazy...
You've got to pay for that! Hey, stop!
You need to seek protection from the sun... ...and it needs to be immediately.
We're facing a deadly threat.
Get out! I didn't see you!
- Is she... Where are the children? - We can't help you now, sir.
Charge.
Clear.
Again.
Clear.
- Ok, call it. - 12:00 midnight exactly.
There's a man down. We need help.
Diana.
I am sorry.
Caleb!
Where is he?
Where's Caleb?
I want my son!
I want my son!
Now!
Dad, don't!
Are you hurt? What did he do to you?
It's ok, Dad. I am ok. This is my friend.
It's ok, Dad. I am ok. This is my friend. They said I can keep him.
Caleb, I want you to come with me. We're going now.
But we have to go with them.
They won't hurt us.
Abby, are you ok?
- Your mom wanted to be here, honey. - I know.
The whisper people told me that Mommy's safe now.
They've been protecting us all along, Dad.
They sent a message ahead of them to prepare the way...
...and now they've come for us.
Who are you?
It's time to go, Dad. They've chosen us so we can start over.
So everything can start over.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Why is he saying that, Dad?
What?
What's he saying, Caleb?
He's saying only the chosen must go...
...those who heard the call.
Please.
I can't go with you, Caleb. I mean, I can't go with you.
They've chosen us to go.
They haven't chosen us, Caleb.
They've chosen you, both of you.
You have to take care of Abby now. You have to be strong for her.
No. I don't want to go without you.
They could've taken you away from me, but they didn't...
...because you have to make this decision yourself.
But you promised.
You said we'd be together forever.
We will be. We will be. I am not leaving you.
But you have to go with them. You have to go. You have to go with them.
Caleb, Caleb, listen to me, Caleb. Stop, stop. Stop. Listen to me. Listen.
We're going to be together. We're all going to be together.
And Mom's going to be with us, too.
I know it. I know that now.
Look. Here. Take this.
Take this. Keep it with you.
One day, you'll know what it means.
I love you, Daddy.
Where's Caleb?
Caleb's safe.
We're going to stay on the air for as long as possible.
All we can say is what we've been repeating all morning.
Get to any kind of underground shelter.
We've been told the satellite...
