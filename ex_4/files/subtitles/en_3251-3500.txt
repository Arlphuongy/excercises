PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE
WE DEMAND JUSTICE MEXICO KILLS WOMEN
TOUCH ONE WOMAN AND WE ALL SPEAK OUT
RAPISTS
Come on. They're letting us in through another door.
Arturo Bravo Díaz and Julia Velázquez Noriega?
Name of family member?
Gertrudis Bravo Velázquez.
Okay.
Age?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
You're the ones who asked us to come here.
Yes.
If you people cared about your work
as much as you care about your phones,
this country would be very different.
Can you tell me your daughter's age?
Isn't it in her file?
It's just to ensure there aren't any errors, ma'am.
She's twenty-four.
Twenty-five.
Her birthday was yesterday.
Thank you.
Any identifying features?
A tattoo on her left forearm.
A tattoo?
Do you have a photo?
Okay.
Give me a moment.
Idiots.
What's wrong?
-It's not Ger. -You say the same thing every time.
-That's impossible. -Do you think this is fair?
They've had her file for months.
The people at the university have been keeping an eye on this.
It's not her.
-Could everyone step outside, please? -What? Why?
-The prosecutor is on his way. -Now I have to leave?
-Please wait outside, ma'am. -This way, please.
But…
I'm sorry, ma'am. We can come back in a moment.
Mr. Bravo, Mrs. Velázquez.
I'm Prosecutor Zamudio Rodríguez.
As I explained in my email,
I was transferred here a few weeks ago.
I'm now in charge of investigating your daughter's case.
The third prosecutor on the case in nine months.
I just follow orders, ma'am.
It seems there was some confusion with Gertrudis's file.
We didn't have any record of such a recognizable feature.
Some confusion?
How can there be any confusion after nine months?
I'm very sorry.
You're sorry.
We want to see her anyway.
-Pardon? -We want to see her.
If she's not our daughter, she's someone else's.
No, that's against protocol.
It was your damn protocol that brought us here to identify a body.
If that doesn't seem painful enough,
then answer me this.
What the fuck are you even doing here if you can't keep your files in order?
The bodies were found in a clandestine grave
and had been there for some time.
They're in an advanced stage of decomposition.
It wouldn't be appropriate to put you through…
-Hello. -Hello.
-My name is Adriana. -Hi, Adriana.
I'm Mitzy's mother.
My daughter disappeared two months ago.
WHERE ARE THEY?
One day she left our house,
and we never saw her again.
-Where did Mitzy go missing? Here? -Yes.
But we were told it was likely
she was taken somewhere else.
Thanks, Adriana.
Is there anything else you'd like to share?
Yes.
Mitzy has a sister.
Adela.
They're twins.
Identical twins.
Adela is 16 weeks pregnant.
And although I've bought clothes and toys for the baby,
the truth is, I feel…
strange.
I can't help feeling I should be a little more…
excited, you know?
It's my first grandchild.
And…
I feel ashamed
that my daughter can see I'm sad all the time.
She never mentions it.
But I can tell she's hurting.
And…
I'd like to be able to talk to her.
To explain.
But I also feel like she's getting tired of me
always going on about the same thing.
And…
I'd also like her to know that…
of course I'm happy.
It's my first grandchild.
But I also want her to know…
every time I see her bump,
it's her sister I think about.
That's why I get sad.
And then I tell myself
that I will find her,
and she'll have lots of children.
Well, if she wants to.
If she doesn't want to, she doesn't have to have any.
The truth is…
I do feel happy sometimes.
But…
half-heartedly.
Hi, Adriana.
-Hi. -I'm Paula.
I've been searching for my mother, Agustina, for seven years.
I think you will feel happy when you see your grandchild.
Truly happy.
That baby will give you another reason to keep fighting with us.
Because that's what babies do.
You're not alone.
-You're not alone. -You're not alone.
Welcome, Adriana.
Just to remind you, we're joined today by journalist Abril Escobedo.
-Some of you know her already. -Hi, Abril.
She'll be taking notes for her investigation.
-Welcome, Abril. -Welcome.
Now we're going to hear from someone
who has come here before, but we haven't seen for a while.
Today is an important day for her.
-Welcome. -Welcome, Julia.
Thank you.
I'm Julia.
Ger's mother.
Gertrudis.
And, yes, today's an important day
because it's exactly nine months since she disappeared.
Remind us, Julia.
What was the last you heard of her?
Ger had just finished her training. She's a psychologist.
She wants to work with children who have difficulty
with reading and writing.
To celebrate, she took a trip with some friends.
And…
I've gone through the official process.
We've…
done everything the police asked.
We spent weeks
in the area where she went missing,
until we got tired of hitting dead ends.
So with her birthday coming around,
it feels like being hit by a train.
Everything hurts.
Then there's Arturo,
Ger's father.
He keeps offering to help take care of everything.
He doesn't understand that's not what I want.
It pisses me off.
It pisses me off that he's so nice.
I don't want him to be nice.
What I want is to know…
where my daughter is.
I understand that it's his way of being there for me.
I'm grateful that
he's looking after me,
but I need him to understand
that it isn't what Ger needs.
I miss her so much.
Today, it's nine months
since she disappeared.
Ger was happy.
And now I don't know where she is.
You're not alone.
Look where I just took a dip,
while you're stuck in the city with all that traffic and pollution.
Here's one.
-There's the other. -Hi.
That's all, Mom. I love you. See you soon.
And relax.
My brother said you're giving the gallery a hard time.
What's that?
It's embroidery.
No, don't worry.
That's my daughter. Do you like it?
Hold on a second. Let me check.
Excuse me. Are you Julia?
-Yes. -This is Emilia, my daughter.
Nice to meet you, Emilia.
Yes. I'll call you later, okay? Thanks.
Sorry, my babysitter canceled on me.
Here.
May I?
Yes, of course.
Sorry.
That's why I brought them.
That's Ger.
Yesterday, they asked us to go and identify a body.
Sweetie, do me a favor.
Go and order me a coffee, and you can get whatever you want.
-Are you hungry? -Yes.
Excuse me.
When Ger was born,
for a long time, I kept catastrophizing.
That's what they call it, right?
When you keep imagining worst-case scenarios.
But you never really know what the worst is
until you wake up to the news that your daughter has disappeared.
DAUGHTER OF ARTIST JULIA VELÁZQUEZ DISAPPEARS WHILE ON VACATION
You're an artist?
I was.
What are you hoping for?
What do you think you should do now?
Yes?
Who is it?
Come on up.
Hi.
Have you called the gallery?
They've been trying to contact you.
I don't know how you're doing for money,
but you could do with making a sale.
It doesn't have to be a new piece. You have so much in your studio.
I'm doing embroidery for myself,
not for anyone else.
What?
Wasn't it painful?
At least I felt something.
Ger designed it.
I feel lost too, Ju.
I don't recognize myself.
Whenever I try to talk about Ger…
it's like there's acid burning me up inside.
For nine months, I've been waking up every day
feeling so much pain…
that I think I'm going to die.
But I don't.
I can't stop thinking about what she might be going through.
What they might have done to her.
Today, I thought it would finally be over.
I wanted it to be her.
We have to go look for her again.
Look where I just took a dip,
while you're stuck in the city with all that traffic and pollution.
Here's one.
-There's the other. -Hi.
That's all, Mom. I love you. See you soon.
And relax.
My brother said you're giving the gallery a hard time.
You're always like this before an exhibition,
and it always goes well…
Ma'am.
Julia, it's Abril. I have some news.
I'm busy right now, but I'll call later and explain everything.
This way, please.
And we're back after that national premiere.
It's 9:23 a.m. on this beautiful, sunny Thursday.
Don't forget we still have some pairs of tickets for the festival…
They'll need to search you, please.
44-33-58-98.
44-33-58-98.
Turn around.
Cell phones and laptops in the box.
Go ahead. She's expecting you.
How are you, honey? Long time no see.
Cas, it's been so long.
How's your little girl? She must be getting big.
She's very well, thanks.
This is Julia.
Thank you for seeing me.
Please, have a seat.
Did you bring the file?
Here it is.
In her work as a lawyer, Cas only handles cases like yours,
so she has to keep moving.
Have they offered you money?
Money?
Government compensation, to get you to back off.
No, they haven't offered me money.
LOCATED
Is there anything that's not in here? Anything you're not telling me?
Any details not in the official file or that Abril hasn't told me?
Well, it's in the official file,
but they tried to use it to implicate Ger.
The security cameras in the bar show her and her friends
going into the bathroom and snorting coke.
She was carrying the baggie.
What do you think about that?
What do I think about my daughter going missing because she went partying?
Is that what you're asking?
No.
That's not what I meant. I'm sorry.
I need as much information as possible so I can work out how to help you.
What did the police say?
They kept bringing it up, like it was all that mattered.
As if it meant she wasn't worth searching for.
Did her friends see anything?
They didn't even notice.
They say she was there one minute and gone the next.
I've known both of them a long time.
I believe them.
It's been very hard for them too.
Who's handling the case?
They just assigned a new--
Zamudio Rodríguez. Do you know him?
He's one of the best.
Though he's still part of the government.
Did you find all these people?
The truth is, I don't know
where to start looking.
-Yes? -Excuse me. It's time to go.
There's something important you should know.
With missing persons, the police usually only search for mass graves.
It's easier to find bodies than people who are alive.
As you know, in cases like these, time is of the essence.
It's been months already.
The place your daughter went missing is near a major sex-trafficking area.
I don't like to speculate, but given her physique,
it wouldn't surprise me if she'd passed through there.
They've found girls being held captive who match your daughter's description.
If you'd like, I can put you in touch with someone.
Or I can make some inquiries and get back to you in a few days.
No, I'll look for her. Tell me what to do.
I'm guessing the local police already know you.
Yes.
Let them know you're back.
I'll start working with the information you've given me.
Let someone know wherever you go or plan to go.
Tell me if you find anything. Be careful.
And don't use a vehicle that can be tracked.
Here.
Thank you.
Eat up.
Mom, what's going on?
Where are you? Are you okay?
Everything's fine, son. Why?
What do you mean, "why"?
I've been calling for days. You never answer the damn phone.
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.
I met a very good lawyer who's going to help us find your sister.
Help us how?
Julia.
Pedro.
I'm not doing anything bad.
I'm looking for your sister.
Just be careful, and tell me what you're doing, okay?
I'm always careful.
Don't do anything stupid just because you're sad.
It's easy for you to say that when you're there.
You were the ones who pressured me to come here.
I didn't even want to.
We're scared. We didn't want you to stay here.
Well, I'm scared too.
I can't just sit around the house waiting.
What the hell am I supposed to do if something happens to you?
Nothing's going to happen to me, and you don't have to do anything, son.
Don't be mad at me.
I'm not mad, Mom. I'm worried.
It feels like…
Nothing.
Nothing?
Mom.
What is it?
Ger is my sister, okay?
You're not the only one who lost her. I think about her every fucking day.
I cry every damn day because I miss her.
No matter where I am or what I'm doing, I suddenly burst into tears,
and you don't even notice.
You're too wrapped up in your own pain
to see you're not the only one who lost Ger.
Pedrojos, sweetheart...
I had no idea.
Forget about it.
I don't know why I told you that.
Mom,
seriously...
let me know where you are,
or I'll get on a fucking plane and come find you.
Don't worry.
I'll keep you updated.
I love you.
You too, Mom.
A lot.
Look after yourself.
Bye.
-Is that side okay? -Yeah.
Hello.
-Hello. -Can I have a hit?
Sure.
Thanks.
Can I see?
LET IT BURN
Did you do this?
Yes.
What's your name?
I'm Liz.
Julia.
You're not from here, right?
Neither are you.
No.
What about them?
Most of us are from the outskirts of the city.
Why are you all here?
We're here to embosom the moms and family members inside.
You're what?
We're supporting them.
They got here yesterday.
They came to meet some fucking officials,
who, after making them wait months for a meeting,
said there was a problem with their files and told them to go home.
The moms said they wouldn't move until they got answers.
Can you imagine?
What would you do?
-Do you have children? -Two.
Pedro and Ger.
Ger?
Gertrudis.
But she never liked having such an old-fashioned name.
She preferred "Ger."
We have the same tattoo.
It's really cool.
What are they doing?
What? You're not one of those people who defends statues, are you?
Sister, listen! This is your fight!
Yeah, it's nice and spicy.
The salsa's delicious.
BECAUSE YOU'RE YOUNG
Excuse me. Did you tell her we're waiting?
Yes, I told her.
Saturday or Sunday? Again?
I'll call you back. Yes.
MUNICIPAL POLICE
Good morning.
How's it going? Did you find anything?
Chief, this file is three years old. Isn't there anything more up to date?
My daughter went missing nine months ago.
Yes.
I know.
Can we check your morgue?
Look, I can show you the morgue, but guess what?
It hasn't been working for seven months.
I'll leave you my number.
If you hear anything, please let us know.
Just because it's you,
we just found something that might interest you.
We'll be here for a few days.
Listen, the way things happen around here,
the container on the roadside that's packed full of
pretty girls
could be there a few days, or it could be gone tomorrow.
Either way, it'll be very difficult to identify the girls later on.
What are we waiting for?
Pedrojos, sweetheart.
I'm just checking in, so you don't worry.
I wanted to tell you the work with the lawyer is going well.
I also have a favor to ask.
Call your dad and tell him I said okay.
Tell him to call the gallery.
Have them sell whatever they can.
I've been trying to contact him, but you know what he's like.
Come on.
I have to withdraw some money to pay the lawyer's fees
and some expenses.
I'll explain later.
I love you, sweetheart.
Go on.
Move it. Come on.
-Get them out of the way. -Go on.
In your own time, man.
-Hurry up. -Come on.
That's more like it. Thanks.
Normally in these cases they're migrants,
but since it's also a sex-trafficking route…
Hey, open it up.
No, honey. No photos.
And not a word to anyone about this.
We're still waiting for the National Guard to get here.
This is a personal favor, okay?
Yes, but please don't break my camera.
Keep an eye on her.
I need that for my work.
-Delete the photos if you want, but-- -I'll be back shortly.
But you'll give it back?
It's good news that she wasn't there, right?
We want to look for her here.
I wouldn't if I were you.
What?
With what I just gave you, you can't take us where we want?
Do what you want.
But I never go there.
They don't like having a woman telling them what to do.
The officer here will take you.
Hello.
To the end, then turn left.
Abril?
-Abril? -América, I'm Abril.
Did you talk to the cops?
You idiots. That fucking police chief knows everyone.
I bet she already put the word out. They'll be coming for you.
Do you know her? Have you seen her?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
She looks familiar, but I'm not sure.
Look, I came because Cas asked me, but none of us should be here.
I know how it feels to have family taken,
but you should go, please.
If she's not here, where would you look for her?
The pastor. Go to his shelter.
-They've gone. -Who?
The police. Grab your things.
-Grab your things. Come on. -Yes.
What shelter? Who's this pastor?
I'll tell you later.
That's all, Mom. I love you. See you soon.
What's that?
And relax. My brother said…
She has beautiful eyes.
You're always like this before an exhibition,
and it always goes well because you're amazing.
Why did you get involved in this if you have a daughter?
My mom asks me that all the time.
But…
You know why it is?
I do it because of my daughter.
She's the reason.
To be honest, sometimes I'm tempted
to leave it all behind and say, "It's not my problem."
Maybe write about something else.
But I can't.
I can't.
My mom also says I'm naive and nothing will change.
But that's another reason I do this, for my daughter.
I want her to understand that she should speak up.
That a lot of people need help, and we have to support each other.
But yeah, sometimes…
Sometimes I'm not around, and the truth is
I do feel guilty about that.
It's here.
-Is this it? -Yes.
Come on.
Come on.
My teddy!
Listen, if you stay there, you can borrow it.
Actually, I'll tell you a story.
Once upon a time, there were three little pigs.
The three little pigs each built a house
to protect them from a big bad wolf
who wanted to eat them.
The first little pig's house was built out of straw.
The second little pig's house was built out of sticks.
Ger?
JUSTICE! NOT EVEN ONE WOMAN LESS
JUAN FERNÁNDEZ MARTÍNEZ BROWN SKIN, BROWN EYES
HE NEVER CAME HOME FROM WORK HE'S 25 YEARS OLD
FERNANDA CASTRO CEBALLOS WENT MISSING ON FEBRUARY 23, 2009
HER DAUGHTER MISSES HER SO MUCH
Julia.
I couldn't find you.
Are you okay?
Cassandra said there was another way of searching.
Martita, come away from there. It might hit you.
You're new, right?
Is it that obvious?
You're nervous.
Yes.
I don't really know what's going to happen.
Do you come on many of these searches?
Nine years.
Two weeks of searching each month.
Every month?
Yes, we just wish...
there were more weeks in a month.
I'm looking for José Arturo.
José Arturo was 20 and Alexis was 16.
Milynali was 13.
Aldo was 20.
They all went missing along with my brother.
August 2012.
All these years, and, well--
They all disappeared at the same time?
They were all together.
But now we're a family.
My friend Tere is looking for her daughter, Perla.
She and her husband disappeared at the same time.
Tere was left with the grandchildren. Can you imagine?
That's Yolanda.
She had triplets, and one of them disappeared.
Guillermo is the one who's missing.
He came here for Christmas from the U.S. and was never seen again.
And Carmelita.
Her son, Moisés,
went missing along with three other boys.
And Mari.
Her son, José Manuel,
went missing in 2010.
At that time,
they would recruit boys his age.
In 2009, 2010.
Back then, things were awful,
with a lot of boys going missing.
We had to learn to search for them
wherever people told us they'd seen something on the ground.
We'd be like, "Come on, girls,"
and maybe we'd find some ID or a clue.
Some clothing they might have left behind.
That's how we started to learn
how to conduct a search
and how to know,
how to tell where we might find something.
Yeah.
The authorities have never--
Over here! I found something.
-Over here! -Lalo, bring the machete.
-Alan, can you come? -Let's go.
It's important.
I'll get the ladder.
Here comes the ladder.
-Carefully. -Make sure it's steady.
We don't want anyone to fall.
I think that's okay. It's stable.
-Yes. -Good.
It's not too deep, is it?
No, it's not that deep. You can see some clothing.
-We won't need many of us. -Does it smell?
A bit, yes. Okay, I'll go down.
-If you want, I can too. -Who else?
-No problem. I'll go down. -I'd like to go down too.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
-Pass her some gloves. -Tere, get her a handkerchief.
And gloves.
Okay. I'll get them for you.
Mari, pass down some flashlights, please.
Please, climb down carefully. Make sure you don't slip.
We're going to find something down there.
There might be a bad smell.
If it gets too strong, use the handkerchief.
Please don't touch anything.
If you find anything, just tell us, okay?
-Yes, okay. -We'll be looking out for you.
And, well,
Lupita said she's going down too, I think.
I'm here.
-Check that the ladder's secure. -Yeah, it's fine.
-Be careful. -I've got it.
Cover your mouth.
Did Julia go down?
Yes.
Be careful. There's a bee's nest down there.
It's small, but be careful.
Hold the ladder steady.
It feels a bit wobbly.
D AND N
Bring the flashlights. There's something here.
How many clandestine graves has your group found?
These graves are only clandestine to us.
They know where they left them. They know where they are.
-Who are "they"? Who dug these graves? -The people who needed to.
Who are you looking for, Lupita?
I'm looking for Daniel, my brother.
He went missing along with Gerardo,
Dianee's brother.
A group of criminals took them.
They demanded a ransom, which we paid,
but they still haven't released them.
Eight people were arrested.
During questioning, they said
they cooked them.
What do you mean by "cook"?
They say it means they dismember the bodies,
burn them in oil drums,
and then scatter the remains.
Like you saw.
That's how we're finding them.
-Okay, girls. -I'm hungry.
This is all we have.
…because we tried to look.
In all these years, the prosecutors haven't contacted you?
-I had one response. -I mean, directly?
-We need to move this table. -Chicharrón, please.
She wants to take some to that handsome cop.
-Me? -But it's my turn!
Aren't you about to take an exam?
I'm not a very good dancer, but here goes.
Dancing barefoot! Wow.
Are you dancing?
You don't want to?
Julia, dance.
Come on!
Edith, help her loosen up.
Is she like Lupita? She only dances to ranchera music.
On your own!
No! Dance with her!
I'd fall over on my own!
-Ladies. -Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon, Lupita. -What time do you call this?
-Sorry, Lupita. -At least you're well rested.
-I had a meeting. You know how it is. -The others are over there.
-Okay. -They've been waiting two hours.
Mr. Rodríguez, can I ask you some questions?
No, now's not a good time.
-Just a few minutes. -Not now.
I'm sorry.
Mrs. Velázquez?
-Mr. Rodríguez. -How are you?
What are you doing here?
Fixing someone else's mistakes.
What are you doing here?
Doing someone else's job.
Excuse me.
Look at this.
It's the piece I wrote on the bodies in the truck.
It's been picked up by ten national news stations.
It's become a trending topic.
Your friend the police chief won't be too happy about this.
I know.
-Hi, sweetie. -Hi, Mom.
How are you?
-Where are you? -I'm in a lovely hotel. What about you?
-Have you had dinner yet? -Yes.
-What did you have? -Chicken and vegetables.
It was delicious.
-Do you miss me? -A lot.
I'll be back soon, and we can see each other.
I miss you a lot too.
-Thanks. -Have a good day.
Anything else?
Your call has been forwarded to voicemail.
Hello?
Come on. If you know me, you know I never listen to my voicemail.
What?
Abril.
Abril.
I'm going to the bathroom.
-Good evening. We're doing some checks. -Good evening. Go ahead.
Lights, please.
ID.
Hurry up.
-What are you looking at? -Nothing.
ID.
They're noting them down.
Here he comes.
-Come with me. -You can't take me. No.
-You can't take me. This is illegal. -Move, damn it.
I'm in a network. You can't take me.
-This is illegal. -Move!
I'm in a network of journalists. If anything happens, they'll look for me.
My name is Abril Escobedo, and I'm a journalist.
I'm Abril Escobedo, journalist! Help me!
-Move. -Help me! My name is Abril Escobedo.
-You can't do this! Julia! -Let's go.
You can't take me! Help me!
Help me!
Help me! My name is Abril Escobedo!
You can't take me!
-No! -Grab her!
Just grab her. Get her in the van. Quickly.
-Move it! -Help me!
Get her inside. Get in, damn it.
Let's go!
No.
Let's go!
Julia.
Julia.
Don't touch me!
-You people killed her! -Calm down.
-She'll be okay. -Get away from me!
Traitors.
You get paid to keep us safe,
but you're the ones taking us.
Julia, they're asking about you.
-You have to leave. I came to find you. -Who's asking about me?
I'm looking for my daughter, and now I'm looking for my friend.
You're right. You have no reason to believe me.
But you're making a lot of people angry.
You can't keep risking your life.
Please, come with me.
Come on. We don't have much time.
Quickly.
We want them back alive!
What are we doing here?
We want them back alive!
We caught him a few weeks ago during an operation targeting gang leaders
in the area where Ger went missing.
He's not the main boss, but we know he operated in the bars
where your daughter was last seen.
He's well-connected, and they're going to release him.
Go talk to the lady.
This is Ger.
Here she is with my son, Pedro.
And…
here she is playing basketball in high school.
She was competing in the nationals.
Did she win?
They came second.
Can I see?
What happened to her nose?
She took a ball to the face.
It was bleeding a lot.
She didn't care. She wanted to keep playing.
She should have won.
Stop looking for her.
You won't find her.
Why not?
What did you do to her? Where is she?
She had some coke, but it wasn't our stuff.
Just for that?
And she was hot.
We're done. Get me out of here, or you'll be in deep shit.
Julia, are you okay?
If you're stopped for any reason, give them this.
Julia?
Julia, you have to leave now.
If I hear anything about your friend, I'll let you know.
Go now. Hurry.
Please, hurry.
You need to go.
Julia.
You need to leave! Ma'am!
Get out of here!
Julia, you have to leave now.
Now. Leave now.
Stop looking for her.
You won't find her.
Let's go!
Not one woman more!
WE ARE NOT AFRAID
Not one woman more!
I EXIST BECAUSE I RESIST
Come on!
Sorry!
We want them back alive!
We want them back alive!
THEY'RE KILLING US
Not even one woman more! Not even one more murdered woman!
Not even one woman more! Not even one more murdered woman!
Not even one woman more! Not even one more harassed woman!
Why are they killing us?
We're the future of Latin America.
Let the sexist men tremble!
Latin America will be completely feminist!
Daughter, listen! This is your fight!
You're not alone!
You're not alone!
WE LOVE YOU!
UNTIL WE FIND YOU
Testing, one, two, three.
Testing.
We shouldn't have to be here.
We shouldn't need to search for our loved ones
or wonder where they are
or who took them.
We shouldn't have to defend our fundamental rights.
But we're doing it.
We always have done it.
We're here
because we're furious...
because of love...
because we're sick and tired.
We're here together
because animals that get preyed on
always move in herds.
And this herd is no longer afraid!
We're not afraid of wolves...
or lions...
or even the worst of predators.
Because they've already taken everything from us.
In the case of our loved ones, they even take their bodies.
They take away their name.
They reduce them to a file.
That's why we fight.
For the young ones...
for the old ones...
for the crazy ones...
for all the other ones...
and for our loved ones.
We're here to make sure they can't go to sleep!
So the eyes of our loved ones
get stuck in their memory like daggers.
So they remember their full names...
their faces...
their height...
and the place where they disappeared.
We are here
to say once again
that in Mexico,
women are killed and go missing every single day.
That those in power are complicit.
That those who stay silent are complicit.
We're not afraid!
But we are not.
We're willing to risk everything...
because every missing person is part of our own bodies.
Yes!
Let it be known that we're no longer afraid!
Let it be known that we're furious!
Justice!
On the ground!
Get back!
Go on! Quickly!
No!
Help us spread the word, please.
We're surrounded. The bastards have gotten inside.
They're rounding us up.
They waited until after dark, when the media had left.
Please! Help us!
Open the gate!
No!
Come on!
Stay united!
The oppressive state is a macho rapist!
The oppressive state is a macho rapist!
Come here. Don't be scared.
Here's your baby. It's okay. We'll protect you.
Get down on the ground!
The group Voice and Dignity for Our People, San Luis Potosí,
is made up of over 300 families searching for loved ones.
In Mexico, since the start of the so-called war on drugs,
the official number of missing persons stands at over 90,000.
This is not about numbers. It's about people.

This film would not have been possible
without the justified fury, the joy, the intelligence,
the determination, and the courage I have seen in so many women.
The women who search tirelessly for their loved ones.
People like you keep the fabric of our nation intact.
All those who shared their story.
Those who, through their work or presence, have shown me the way.
My mother. My daughter.
These are some of the works and movements that, knowingly or unknowingly,
accompanied me during the making of this film.
Easy, I'm working on it.
Lookie here, our golden boy!
-Hi! -Show me your hands, Jiu-Jitsu.
Have you seen my nifty new jacket?
It's windproof, but the leather is breathable so you don't sweat that much.
-It's pretty sweet. -The boss is waiting.
What's up?
Boss, have you seen my new wheels? V8, 500 horses.
-Do you want to take it for a spin? -Maybe some other time.
So? Is working for me paying off?
I can't complain.
Is this my merch?
Yeah, it's for you. Why are you so twitchy, though?
Boss, if you prefer to talk, it's fine by me.
Well, in fact I do.
You know…
It seems there's a rat. In my crew.
He's going to get fucked. Do we know who it is?
Yeah. My best guy. An ambitious, smart son of a bitch.
Wears sports outfits.
But classy.
You think it's me, boss?
The pigs also like to call you Jiu-Jitsu.
We speak well of the dead, or not at all.
I prefer the latter.
-Die, pig! -Over my dead body.
You're under arrest.
I found out where you live.
You and your wife.
Karolina.
Beautiful woman.
LESSON PLAN
-Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. -Good morning.
Let's waste no time.
First off, attendance. Those who don't raise a hand are considered absent.
Paula?
Paula's here. Lyosha?
-I'm here. -He's here.
Jasiek?
Is he out again?
That's not good. Two absences in a row.
He doesn't really care anymore.
Mr. Makowiecki… Jasiek does drugs.
Dude…
And I mean… a lot.
Was he under the bridge with them?
We tried to help him somehow… Harry, Kamil and I.
-I told him how bad the shit was. -But he ended up getting totally zonked.
Nothing gets to him anymore.
His mother is calling.
Answer it, then.
Hi there, bud.
You don't call back, you don't open the door for your old friend.
I know you're at home. I heard your steps and the sound of the TV.
Okay, I know it's seems weird, but we haven't seen each other for quite a while.
Drop by for dinner, okay?
We've got a terrible mess down here.
You need to help me out with something.
But Jasiek wasn't the first victim in our school.
This is just… the tip of the iceberg.
Security constantly searches the kids. They find fentanil, desomorphine,
and… umm… some kind of speed-like designer drugs.
All of it sold by a gang.
They practically do it in the open.
You have a gang in your school?
It's just a… bunch of kids. Senior year.
Just leave it, we'll clean it up tomorrow.
I'm going to get going.
Drop by more often, will you?
I'll do my best.
The question is, who supplies it?
Because I don't believe a bunch of teens could put together such an operation.
It's not that easy. And it's not cheap.
You need money, access to a lab and you need to know the proper procedures.
Tell me one thing. Are you running the investigation?
I think I know where it is.
And when I find the stuff? I'll find out who it belongs to.
Ela is right. Just leave it to the people who know how to deal with this, okay?
But you know how to deal with stuff like this.
Are you going to help me?
Will you go there with me?
I can't. I'm busy.
Busy with what?
Drinking?
Leave it, bro. You won't change anything anyways.
How could I help you if I can't even help myself?
-Give that back. -What? This?
Take it, then.
Bad decision.
Fucker!
I told you to give it back.
Cool down a bit, boy.
Where was I….
I don't like what I'm seeing.
I just wanted to do a little shopping.
-What? -I think you've drunk enough.
But it's your liver, bro.
WAREHOUSE 30A
The police have found the body of an alleged manufacturer of fentanyl.
This highly addictive drug has, in recent months,
become a real epidemic in Polish schools.
According to unconfirmed reports, the man responsible
for manufacturing the drug committed suicide in his own lab.
Of particular interest, as our reporter found out,
the drug is manufactured by Szymon M.,
a former history teacher at Jan Sobieski High School.
It is assumed that his decision to take his own life
was caused by the recent death of his student, which…
Are you heading to Szymon M's house? Did you two know each other?
Were you aware of his criminal activity?
How did a prominent history teacher handle the fact that he poisoned…
Damian…
…and destroyed… the lives of teenagers
and… could you please comment on that?
They think that Szymon…
-that it was him…. -I know…
Isn't it cool to have a dad who's a drug dealer?
Leave him alone, man. Let go.
Damian…
-He just assaulted a police officer. -He didn't assault anybody.
He's just in shock. Leave him alone. His father's dead.
Leave him be.
The briefcase is complimentary.
It's going to work, right?
Unless someone starts picking at it.
Then it won't.
We've never met and I wasn't here.
-You're here for the job? -Yes, that's correct.
The principal will see you soon.
Do you happen to know if there are a lot of candidates?
Candidates?
Don't make me laugh. Candidates…
the very fact someone applied for the job is a miracle.
There are vacancies in other schools. Better ones.
Such a young, handsome man… Why bother?
-Are you the man? So soon? -I guess so.
-Great. Welcome. Leszek Zamoyski. -Damian Nowicki. Hello.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
Has Krysia been telling you some nice things about us?
You see… Some people like to say bad things about our school.
And I'm not saying they're wrong. There's a grain of truth in each rumor
but… let's not get carried away.
Is everything all right?
You see… It's true that we have… had…
I mean, we had problems with drugs.
But the manufacturer of this "shit", as they call it, is dead, so…
the issue is going to die down.
I've hired a security agency. Perhaps you've heard of them.
Chmielski and his crew.
The best in the business.
They were recommended to us. So… you are going to be safe here.
And here's my deputy, Agata Kierska.
The star of our mother tongue, our Polish teacher.
Or simply Agata.
Damian, hi.
Damian is going to teach history.
Oh, yeah? You've decided to come despite…?
Please, don't scare him. It's water under the bridge.
When can I start?
That's the spirit, Damian.
You start tomorrow. We'll put up a new schedule.
Welcome aboard and go Hussars!
Go Hussars!
…like the other dude, huh?
Cos… I tried to call you… because I thought that…
I mean… that I can drop by?
At… your place?
You know…
for the night?
Tenner, here you go.
Put that back.
And who might you be?
The boy deserves some respect. Put that back.
Did you hear that?
Mammoth!
You want to roll with us?
Calm down!
Relax! To the principal's office!
Come on!
You either put that back, or go with him.
Chmielski, you don't have a sense of humor?
-And who might you be? -Damian?
A journalist? -Hi. -Hi.
He's our new history teacher.
Hello.
Come on. I'll show you around.
It was nice meeting you, professor!
Jasiek was a really nice boy.
Apparently, he couldn't cope with his problems.
And later it turned out it was Szymon who manufactured it.
Makowiecki. The history teacher you're replacing.
You're going to teach his son, Kamil.
He's still going to be absent today.
You know, it will take some time before he is able to get back to school.
Guys, I'd like you to meet Damian Nowicki, our new history teacher.
-Edyta Mazur. -Hi.
You're a brave man, I see.
I see you like a good challenge. Witek.
Julia.
Damian, hi.
-Let's go. -Nice to meet you.
Stefan, come and meet Damian. He's taking over for Szymon.
Ho… hold it.
B… blow me.
-Wojtek! -S… sorry.
W… we'll see when I g… give you a s… surprise quiz.
G… good morning.
-See what it's like around here? -Nothing unusual here.
Well… I w… wouldn't be so sure.
Follow me, I'll show you your classroom.
Oh, I'll take everything.
Sure, watch me. What's up?
It says here that we are one of the worst high schools in Poland.
Awesome. Did you hear that? Good job!
We're maintaining our standards, right?
-You'll get it back after the lesson. -This is my phone.
I'm so sorry.
Damn, they found a substitute this fast?
Damn, they did.
My name is Damian Nowicki and I'm going to be teaching you history.
Can you hold this?
Are you a drug lord, too? Like the previous guy?
Hey, Kamil will kill you for saying stuff like that.
Hey, first of all, Makowiecki was no drug lord.
Where did you leave off with your previous teacher?
I drew you.
-Sigismund the Old. -Your dad's old.
-Which century is it? Anyone know? -16th century, sir.
Leave it! I told you I can't! We will never know.
Hello! Gentlemen? Is everything all right?
Of course, sir.
Everything's cool.
Oh, really? And what does your friend say?
What does my friend say?
Yes, everything is fine.
Frogface is my mate, we're just fooling around.
How old is your mate?
Should you be in this class?
He should be long gone.
-He dropped out three years ago. -Zip it!
I'll just sit here with you for a while.
I love history.
A touching story. Get out!
-Throw me out. -Frogface!
How many times do we have to ask?
-Frogface! -Walk him out, please.
On the double!
I don't want to see your face in here again.
Can I still drop by your place?
Check if he's got something on him and take him to the police station.
-Sure thing, boss. -See you later, professor!
You're still here?
Yes. I'm not familiar with this textbook.
I just wanted to make some notes. Before the lessons.
May I?
INTRODUCTION
THE EARLY MODERN PERIOD
And what do you think?
I mean… It's full of pictures, illustrations.
Young people like this sort of thing, so the book is pretty workable.
And how was your first day?
I heard about… your run-in with our former student.
What can I say.
Kids today don't recognize authority.
I won't bother you any longer. Have a good one.
Professor?
Are you looking for this?
Rookie mistake.
The school staff uses the underground parking lot.
It's safer down there.
Such a nice Polish teacher, alone at night? Bam!
Ms. Agata, I must admit, it wasn't very nice of you.
That's why I need to relax now. Such a pretty teacher, all alone.
Stand still!
-Help! -Shut up! I said, shut up!
Frogface!
The lady said goodbye to you earlier today, didn't she?
So? Are you going to beat me up, now? You? A measly history teacher?
In just a minute you're going to be history.
Watch out!
Now…
Fuck…
Damian!
What the hell was that?
Where did you learn to do that?
It's just my hobby.
You don't like to talk about yourself, huh?
That's enough. Thank you.
Stand in front of me.
I'll show you how to break free in a situation like that.
Okay?
How did he hold you.
Wait, like that? Grab me like this with both hands.
And now… you hit the guy in the stomach.
If that doesn't work, give him one in the face.
Hold this hand. Go down using your legs.
Great. Now twist it behind my back. Great.
And now you push…
and run. Simple enough?
-Okay… thanks. -Damian!
Is there some way I can repay you?
Can you give me a lift home? They slashed my tires.
No, please! No!
No! No!
-Shut up! -Guys! Guys, no!
No! No!
Jaro! My friend!
Don't you get it? I have nothing to live on!
What was I supposed to do?
I had some stuff left and…
"Friend"?
You're going to have to explain yourself to somebody else.
What?
Jaro! We can work this out!
Come on, stop it! No! Jaro, he's going to kill me!
Shut up!
Please! Boss, no! I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to do it! Please!
Really! Please, it'll never happen again!
I'm begging you!
You almost got busted today.
I didn't have anything on me!
I'm not that stupid! I just wanted to make some extra money! Boss, please!
It won't happen again, I promise!
Let me go! Please! Please, let me go! Boss! I'm begging you!
Please, let me go! I'm begging you!
You'll serve as an example for others.
-No! Nooo! -Let Mammoth do it!
-No! -Let him prove his worth.
Be quiet, scum!
Do it once, and do it right!
No!
Do it!
No! Leave me alone, please!
And?
-You can do it! -Mammoth!
OK, Mammoth.
-You wanna roll with us? -I do.
-Will you follow orders? -I will.
Boss, where are you taking my car?
-Hello? -Wait a minute.
To fix your tires.
-Who told you to do that? -The principal.
Thanks.
T… that was brutal!
Look! Our hero is here!
Damian…
Hello everybody…
Umm… listen, my car has been… Do you know something about it?
Don't worry about it. You'll get it back, good as new before classes are over.
It's the least I can do to thank you for saving our lovely Agata.
Something had to be done, right?
Go, hussars! Damian!
-Damian! -R… r… rewind!
You sorted them out quite easily. Who are you, anyway?
HISTORY
Yeah. P… partners!
Higher!
Jesus…
-Whoah! -You failed!
You're like Chuck Norris. Almost.
Let's get back to the Jagiellonian dynasty.
Macaque! Macaque, get back to your seat!
Could you explain this, first?
What did I tell you about cell phones in class?
Are you a murderer?
If you don't pull up your grades, I just might become one.
Could you fight in an MMA match?
Yeah. Is that some kind of karate?
How many push-ups can you do?
-Kung-fu? -Jab, jab and then hook?
Taekwondo? Aikido? Or maybe Krav maga?
A good warrior finds inspiration in all fighting styles.
He tries to match his opponent and the environment.
He's like water poured into a vessel.
-Do you know who said that? -Bruce Lee?
-Correct. -Internet!
But I mean a real fight. Okay?
I mean… a proper brawl.
And why would you want to start "a brawl"?
What do you mean "why"?
To kick the asses of the ones who have it coming.
And have you been successful? Generally speaking… I'm doing fine.
Or maybe… I'll show you.
If you win, there's no final exam.
Harry!
Are you ready? Good!
-Bring it on! -You can do it!
Come on, come on, come on! I want an A!
Here, behind you. Come on.
Are you okay?
Harry, you're slacking off!
Get him, Harry!
Come on!
Focus!
-You're a hussar! -Come on! Fight!
-Come on! -Fight!
Come on, Harry! You can do it!
-Come on, come on, come on! -It's nothing! Come on!
-Come on, come on, come on! -Do it!
Come on! Keep it up!
Come on! Now!
-Come on! -You've had enough?
Okay, get up.
He's got spirit! Good!
Add some technique and you'll be okay.
-You're going learn some history, though. -Macaque!
Kamil!
Dude, I'm impressed…
Kamil…
Kamil, they set him up. I know that.
Seriously? You came up with that all by yourself?
I want to prove it.
He asked for your help and you said "no"!
And now you're showing off?
And when my dad needed you, where were you?
-You're right. You're right. -You refused to help him!
If it weren't for you, he'd still be alive!
It's all your fault!
I know!
You think I don't go over it in my head every day!?
You're just like him, you know that?
He hated losing. Just like that.
When we played pool.
He used to get so fucking pissed, so I had to learn how to play like shit.
You know what I'm talking about.
You used to play with him.
Pathetic.
Yeah, pathetic.
We went to the Champions every week.
For over a year.
Every week he had to win.
Otherwise he wouldn't have plucked up the courage to ask the bartender out.
Until she finally agreed to go out with him.
I know how my parents met.
You see?
His tenacity made you.
And that's why he went there. To finish it.
What are you doing here, anyway?
You're no damn historian.
Well said.
But please, try not to share that information with anybody.
Why?
I want to prove his innocence.
My dad is dead. It's too late for that.
But you're alive and so are your friends.
That's why nobody can find out why I'm here, okay? Will you help me?
How can I help you if I can't even help myself?
Zamoyski made an effort, huh?
Seems like it, yeah.
So… how's your second day at work?
I heard you've gained quite a following.
Yeah. Unfortunately, they aren't so interested in history.
You'll get there, eventually.
I doubt it.
Fancy a beer? There's a bar close by.
We can check some essays. Have a chat…
-Whose essay now? -Emilia's.
She wrote about her father, who's bringing her up all by himself.
She writes:
"He helped me when I got addicted to fentanyl.
He didn't give up,
even when I cursed at him and acted horribly".
And then she talks about
how much she appreciates how hard he works for them.
What does he do?
He has a workshop.
He cuts keys, sharpens knives, repairs watches.
That kind of thing.
How's your hand?
-Fine. -Show me.
Ouch.
As they say, "it'll heal before the wedding".
Whose wedding? Are you planning to get married?
No, thanks.
No, come on.
I'll grab us another beer, okay?
Come on, Marian!
Hey, you dykes!
Do you have a problem with the ladies?
-How about we talk this through? -What?
What's your problem, pipsqueak?
-Man, what did you have for dinner? -Tripe!
I need to lose a few pounds.
Ouch!
You want more?
Keep your hands higher.
Come on.
I told you to keep them higher.
Watch out!
Did you take all the essays with you?
Will you mark them well in your state?
Yeah, because someone
might get a B instead of a C plus.
Yeah, that would be a disaster.
But you're right. I'd better sober up a bit.
Over some tea.
Was that an invitation?
Yeah, for a cup of tea.
Want some wine?
-Yes. -I'll get some.
We're not locking the door?
What for? I'm safe with you.
I'm safe with you.
You and your wife…
Karolina.
-Ouch! Let go! -Why?
Do you know who I hang out with?
Don't mess with us!
Oh, yeah? And what do you think I'm doing now?
You don't fit in there. You've got something they lack, reason.
They're using you but if stuff goes down, they'll leave you on your own. Trust me.
-Fuck you! -I've tried to do that already.
Where do they get their stuff and who manufactures it?
Dude, don't you get it? I can't tell you anything!
Justyna, hi.
What's up?
-Nothing. Everything's okay. -Is it?
-Are you buying something? -Why do you care?
Show me your hands.
Why are you such a nag? You miss being high?
I can help you out with that. For a single smile.
Justyna…
Justyna, I'm begging you.
You'll take some drugs for a week
and then… you won't just need it, you'll want it.
And this guy? He'll become the most important person in your life.
Shut the fuck up!
Do you really want that?
Emilia… do you have a problem?
No, I'm just talkin to Justyna. Why?
Why so emotional?
Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything.
-Right, Bigos? -Yeah.
See?
You push people into addiction,
but you're saying that nobody makes anyone do anything?
Go take a run.
Take a rest.
Those are healthy choices, aren't they?
Fuck off.
Don't touch me!
-Don't touch me! You hear me? -Hey!
-Leave her alone! -Shut up!
Little Kamil?
Don't do this. Your mum only has you left.
Who's next?
You?
Anybody else have a problem?
Come on then!
That's what I thought.
Macaque! Give me the ball!
And shut up!
I'm very sorry. He's coming this way. So…
Hi.
Did Zamoyski tell you about the new class register?
What?
That we're switching to an online version?
If you need any help, ask Witek Mróz, the computer science teacher.
He'll explain everything to you.
-Okay. -Agata!
See you around.
Are you ready for a new dose of history?
Why hasn't the whiteboard been erased?
Where's the student on duty? Where's Harry?
You're late.
Now tell me what happened.
There's nothing to talk about.
There's a lot to talk about, Harry.
Who did this?
-Kamil! -I stumbled and fell.
Stumbled into who? The gang?
Will somebody tell me what happened?
Easy for you to say but we're the ones who get beaten up.
-You outnumber them. -So what? We suck!
You do if you think so.
But let's say you're not real happy about the whole situation
and you don't want to suck anymore…
you have to stop thinking this way.
Are you a history teacher or a life coach?
They need to see that you're not afraid of them.
Now that's a great fucking piece of advice.
They're stronger.
So be smarter!
Faster.
Better prepared.
Adjust.
Like water, Harry.
-Like water he says… -Could you help us with that?
All right…
but under one condition.
Is this supposed to be your dojo?
Pretty much. Can't you see it?
We'll put training mats right here and some benches over by the wall.
And a locker room at the back. We've got everything we need.
You have quite an imagination.
Yeah, sure… and we'll start training in about two years.
No, sorry. Forgive me, guys, but that's not quite what I signed up for.
What the hell is this supposed to be?
What do you want us to do? Renovate Jarek's gang to death?
Forgive me, sir, but this is… lame.
Nobody is forcing you to be here.
The place has potential.
When do we start?
Hey! Franek!
This will be on the test!
I can see what you're doing!
-Let's get the fuck out of here! -Police!
Hey! Wait!
Girls, come on! Don't go!
We're unlucky when it comes to history teachers.
Szymon was a pain in the ass, but this guy is…
A hemorrhoid?
He's chasing off customers.
What happened to Bigos and Jock?
Nowicki learned their addresses
and called the cops when they were on a pick-up.
They'll get a lawyer and keep their mouths shut,
but we lost money.
A lot of it.
Somebody has to take care of this.
-Arigato Sensei. -Guys! Wait up!
See you later! We had a good workout.
On your toes!
Guys, wipe your shoes before you step on the mat.
Are you done with your warm-up? Can we start the training?
Fuck!
An accident in the shower?
You missed a hellova party.
But you can still drop by.
Nowicki looks pretty okay.
Unlike you guys.
He's not a regular teacher.
Nowadays, there are better ways to destroy a man.
Good morning!
What do you want?
To talk about having a watch fixed.
I can't accept this. I've got too much work.
Then people are surprised when small businesses go under.
Please, leave.
I don't want to see you around here.
You're dealers and thugs..
You're the ones who got Emilka hooked on that shit.
Oh, really?
And I thought she really just enjoyed it.
Get out! Or I'll call the cops!
Dad, wait!
Dad! Dad, please!
Wait!
Let me talk to them.
OK?
I'll wait in the back.
What do you want?
To have my watch fixed.
Can you take a look?
Here…
It used to tick… and tock…
but now it's stopped.
TO SZYMON ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 18TH BIRTHDAY
Makowiecki's watch…
Do you love your daddy?
Murderers!
Now, listen to me.
No, the leverage is pretty good. They failed to calculate the load properly.
If they took physics into consideration and measured…
-Oh, excuse me… -…they would lift it up just fine.
Oh look at you, Professor…
Damian…
Emilia has just told us that…
you've committed…
I mean…
You molested her when you were alone in that dojo of yours…
I can't wrap my head around it. What have you got to say for yourself…
Emilia…
You know you did it, don't lie…
I begged you….
But you forced your disgusting hands…
You're going to have to leave school grounds and I must suspend you.
Until the case has been sorted out.
Security will see you out.
I really don't understand it.
Hey, hey.
Kamil… Leave it!
I trusted you! I trusted you! Don't you get it?
-Just calm down. -I fucking trusted you!
And what did you do?
Come on, talk! You're really good at that!
-Good bye, professor! -Farewell! This one's for you!
Cool, huh?
I had to do it.
They showed me Makowiecki's watch.
And they threatened to kill my old man.
So… yeah.
You want to throw your life away because of me?
It's all my fault.
Give it back.
I can't.
Damian!
Emilka!
Jesus…
Get out! And leave my daughter alone!
First you try to destroy her, and now you come here to intimidate her?
-Dude, get… get out of here! -Wait…
Get out!
My dear girl…
My little girl, why?
Good day, professor.
You come here to finish the job?
Do it.
Frogface…
I've got better things to do on a Friday night.
So why did you come here?
To kiss you so you become a prince.
You worked for Chmielski. How did the drugs end up in the school?
You see how I look?
You wanna know why?
Because I wanted to sell an extra gram on the side.
A touching story.
Look.
Do you see it, or not?
The eyes of a victim.
Of a hounded animal.
Do you want to remain a victim for the rest of your life?
And you think you can change that?
How are the drugs brought into the school?
I've got news for you.
They don't get brought in.
Agata!
I've got nothing to say to you.
I know what you think about me,
-but can you just hear me out? -Do you really?
If you did, you wouldn't have come here at all.
Can you do anything else besides beat people up?
Leave, or I'll call the cops.
I know where the drugs are made.
I'm calling now.
Shitty phone!
FOOD SERVICE
Hey!
Don't move!
-We've called the cops. -Unless you like it when it hurts.
You can get used to it.
Especially when it hurts other people.
Let's see if you have the balls!
Pure crap.
Agata…
Agata…
Please, let me speak.
I took the keys. I had to. Listen to me.
The drugs are made at the school. Idziorek manufactures them.
The gang works with that… umm… catering company.
With Foodie Max? That's ridiculous.
What is this? You can't see a thing.
That's why I told you I had no hard evidence.
It's also why I came to you, not the police.
I was hoping you'd believe me.
Lemon balm tea, sir.
-Mrs. Krysia? -Yes?
Call Stefan Idziorek and… security.
I've already done that.
Mr. Nowicki here claims you work with…
this gang
to manufacture this…. fentyl stuff.
F… fentanyl.
Yeah, that's what I meant. Thank you.
He claims that he saw you… transporting… freshly-made drugs…
from the school chemistry lab to… a Foodie Max van.
I saw you there that night.
I'm talking to you.
B… because I was there.
Because I h… had to c…clean up.
Everything had to be c…cleaned up.
I helped Mr. Idziorek.
It has already been reported. At the school office.
We were there.
E… exactly.
Damian… we are all sick and tired of these drugs but…
maybe you've gotten a bit carried away.
Ma… Makowiecki…
Correct. It was Szymon Makowiecki who manufactured the drugs.
Shut the fuck up.
I know you set him up.
Strong words for a perv.
Easy! Relax! Walk him out.
I'll find my way out.
Honey…
Baby, someone wants to see you.
I'm so ashamed of myself…
You did nothing wrong.
It's Nowicki who ought to be ashamed.
You're innocent.
Aren't you?
Can you do anything besides beat people up? Leave or I'll call the police.
It's too late…
It was Szymon Makowiecki who manufactured the drugs.
He asked for your help and you refused.
If it weren't for you, he'd still be alive!
We've got a terrible mess down here. You need to help me out with something.
Damian?
I talked to Emilka.
I'm sorry.
You should be mad at me.
Maybe. Maybe I should.
What's that?
The cheapest whisky. Disgusting, isn't it?
I love it.
School surveillance?
Yeah, but it's edited.
There's nothing there.
They're good.
What was your job before you joined our school?
I was a cop.
I was working on a drug ring.
But back then I had the support of the state.
At least that's what I thought.
Some idiot failed to secure the database and they found Karolina.
My wife.
I rushed to save her but it was too late.
And the gang?
It doesn't exist anymore.
So what? If there are people like Chmielski and Idziorek?
That's why you ended up in our school?
Szymon was my friend.
I applied for the job to find out who did it and exact my revenge.
But I failed.
And after the way they fired me, nobody will ever trust me again.
Ouch!
They… threatened to kill my… family!
Who?
I j… just c… cook!
For who? Chmielski?
Speak.
F… for m… myself!
For m… my… Monika!
I finally had the chance to be someone!
I'll take care of that…
Mrs. Monika, I… I really don't know what to say.
It's such a horrible thing…
Stefan has worked with us for years. He was a great teacher.
He was a real chemistry enthusiast.
A teacher like him is irreplaceable.
-If there's anything I can do… -Thank you.
I think it high time… we emptied… Szymon's locker.
Despite what he did, his widow deserves some respect.
Would you be so kind and hand his things over to Ela?
-I'd be most grateful. -Of course.
Excuse me sir, you have a visitor. It's important.
Emilka, hi. How are you?
How are you feeling? Are you coming back to school?
I'd like to ask you to reinstate Mr. Nowicki.
After what he did to you?
Because I lied. Damian didn't even lay a finger on me.
-I'm sorry. -So… what was this all about?
I don't know…
They came to see my father. They threatened him.
They made me do it.
Please, sit down.
MA SZ. MAKOWIECKI
We forgot to do just one thing.
To grease the door.
Emilia told us about everything.
We fucked up big time.
Hey! This isn't a race track!
Emi!
What's wrong with her?
Internal hemorrhaging.
But fortunately, they managed to stop the bleeding.
Now she's in a postoperative coma.
It's my fault.
You can't think like that. It wasn't your fault.
-I'll kill them! I swear! -Calm down.
Stay with her, she needs you right now. I'll handle it.
Damian, we need to talk.
I didn't want them to hear it, but Kamil's right.
We need to find the drugs in the warehouse.
How are we supposed to do that?
Have you been there? The place is huge.
I know. But I've got this.
-Look. -What is it?
I found it in Szymon's locker.
To the right of the entrance, row "H". Food Max cartons.
Dairy products.
How long do we have to wait?
Oh no, please!
He's just taking a nap. What are you doing here?
I'm going with you.
I'm your supervisor. So, you have to obey my orders.
OK!
Agata!
I wouldn't do that.
Good evening, professor.
And good evening to you too, sir.
I'll have to hire a new Polish teacher.
Do you know how hard it is to find somebody to work in this school?
It's like like luring small children.
It was enough to say I had small kittens in my basement
and leave the door open.
Szymon's notepad…
What's the point?
I really used to make an effort.
This was meant to be a world-class school.
Sobieski's Hussars. Go, hussars!
Scholarships…. better staff…
And where did we end up? Fucking nowhere. Why?
Because they preferred to do drugs and fuck in the toilet stalls.
So they got the school they wanted.
After all, isn't that a success?
I will destroy you, you know that?
Oh… Szymon said the exact same thing…
-Calm down! -Leave me alone!
-Oh… here you go. -Leave it!
I even wear the souvenir he left me!
Fuck, it doesn't seem to work.
Doesn't matter. Your time has come.
No!
No!
And who the fuck are you?
Come here, russkie! Come on, come on!
How did you like that, Mammoth?
Little Mammoth. What are you looking at, huh?
I'm from Ukraine mi dorohy druzhe.
Slava Ukraini!
Gonzo! Bring him to the mirror!
This one's for Emilia, you punk.
-You hit like a girl. -You know peculiar women.
Your cable a bit too short?
Shaolin? Special forces? Where are you from?
From Rabka Zdrój.
-What? -A beautiful resort town.
Kamil!
He looks a bit shocked.
Damian, you still don't get it, do you?
The girl is in a coma because of you!
Idziorek's death is also on you.
You want her to be your next victim? Move back!
To think I really grew fond of you the moment I hired you.
I thought I was the only candidate.
Yeah, that too.
Did I do well? Did you see that?
You're too small for me!
Understand?
You're nothing to me!
-Fuck you! -Come here!
Move it!
-What now? -I don't know.
Get off me!
-Stop twitching! -Okay, okay, okay.
-Bro, you really beat up Tytus! -Stop talking!
Yeah, you too. You and the girls were really at their throats.
He deserved it.
If it weren't for you…
Catch.
Give it back. It's not yours.
Where'd you get them? We could've got caught in the strait.
A woman was kidnapped by a local warlord.
-He's holding her in a base by the coast. -Who is she?
Eliza Mazur.
There's a bonus for her.
She documented Yousif's war crimes.
We'll get the dough when we deliver the evidence.
-They were gonna send SFs, but-- -Mercenaries are more convenient.
You bet.
There's a guide waiting for us.
Then a quick op, and we head back home.
You're not gonna tell me who ordered this?
Are you okay?
Where did the bad people go? Don't be frightened. We're friends.
Wait for my signal.
I knew it.
What is this?
Eliza Mazur?
Spare him.
Pisses me off, too, but can be useful.
-Who are you? -We ask the questions here. Let him go.
Got the photos?
This can't fall into the wrong hands.
Guard her.
We've got the photos.
Mines.
Hurry. They'll be here soon.
Who?
-Who? -Give me a gun!
Behind you!
Fuck, where did you bring me?
-What the fuck? -Don't cry, kid.
It'll be easier in smaller groups.
This way.
Your people will die because of you.
Piotrek.
Kid?
Piotrek. We have to go.
-Kid. -Everything's burning.
Piotrek!
Stop!
Stop, Piotrek!
It's me! Your brother. Stop!
Your brother.
Krzysiek, Fang here.
-What's good? -Nothing. Come get us.
-When? -Now.
Tarnation.
Seriously, Fang, again? We agreed--
Krzysiek, "now" means now.
Don't tell me you've got clients.
Okay, send me the GPS.
-What are you doing? -I'll pass on the sightseeing flight.
So, how do you plan to get out of here? I don't.
You've got the photos. You don't need me.
Mission accomplished.
And I've got my own.
-We'll distract them. -Fang.
See ya.
-Leave him! -It's supposed to be fun!
You didn't mention a whole bloody army!
It worked out well. I'll charge them double.
Robert Kieł.
Code name… Fang.
How formidable.
Special forces.
Three tours in Iraq.
A daredevil.
You got badly hurt saving…
It's that pilot of yours. You were saving him.
Krzysztof Bielik followed my order.
I lied to him. He thought it was going to be a sightseeing flight.
Krzysztof's license is suspended.
But there is one thing you can do
to help your friend and, by extension, yourself.
All of them are ex-military.
Like you. Special forces.
Suspended, demoted.
Discharged.
Some of them accused of very bad things.
-I wasn't discharged. -No.
You got a medal and simply resigned.
Out of curiosity, why?
Not enough money?
What do you want from me, man?
NMP.
All of them took part in the assassination of two MPs.
Officially, these were unrelated acts of violence.
You know, some… maniacs with PTSD.
But I know who hired them.
NMP.
They're all dead.
They'll kill you, too, once you're no longer needed.
-You've got the wrong guy. -I want to help you.
But if you don't want my help, then…
Get out of my way or you'll be guarding a grocery store.
This is a goddamn circus you have here.
What the fuck are you playing at? You handcuffed a war hero?
-Minister, sir-- -Handcuffs, now!
We'll talk again.
Come.
I'm really sorry about them.
Tough luck. You fell into the hands of bureaucrats.
Let them push pencils around, not soldiers.
-Do you have the photos? -Where are we going?
We need to talk.
And where's Piotr?
You ordered the mission.
What about Piotr?
Piotrek is dead.
I'm sorry.
Keep an eye on them.
Sure.
American? NATO?
That's what our intelligence called it.
But it's made in Poland.
-A lot of corpses. -Unfortunately.
It was an accident. Supposedly.
The device was part of an experiment.
It was supposed to cure cancer
through the use of experimental technology.
The first tests were very promising.
This man could tell you more.
Prof. Witold Mazur.
The head of the team.
The device's creator
and currently the right hand of Gen. Yousif Bashir Mammadov.
Mazur.
Eliza's father.
That's why she went there.
She wants to persuade her father to come back and show him
how the general is using his invention.
But according to our information, Prof. Mazur knows it perfectly well.
He is the one who changed the device's parameters.
He is the one responsible for the death of nearly his entire team.
Apart from Eliza, his assistant.
Needless to say,
this weapon is extremely dangerous in Gen. Mammadov's hands.
What do you propose?
Officially? Nothing.
We can't engage in the internal matters of a foreign country.
But?
But…
You know,
if someone really wants something,
and they're in the right place at the right time…
miracles do happen.
Nice bike.
Motorcycle.
A junker, but it'll ride.
Talkin' bout me, Storm?
Can we talk?
Ania's done with you.
Right?
Natka, I…
Where's Piotrek?
For how long?
You promised me.
You know very well that Piotr wasn't just a friend.
Jarek. I really need you to say something.
I asked the others, but you know how it is.
Most of them won't cooperate with me.
If I'm to launch my own brand, I need to be sure it's top shelf.
Jarek…
Hi, Jarek.
Hi.
Storm. Kinda looks like you. Maybe you two could adopt her?
You told us to wait, so you could drain it?
-Hiya, Bull. -Ania.
If you're sad, hug a dog But a cat is a bother
Hi.
Hi, Bull. My pops used to sing it when he was sad.
He's with us.
So? Are we drinking?
American Dream.
Like always.
So we ought to drink a little. For Piotrek. To remember him.
-Why do I always get the smallest glass? -Small, but crazy.
Oh, I like that.
Will you say something?
Piotrek was…
Let's just drink, yeah?
All right. Pour another one.
Cheers.
There are two goals to your mission.
First, get hold of Soulcatcher and transport it safely to Poland.
-Wouldn't it be better to blow it up? -I agree.
That would be safest, but…
I've consulted our scientists.
The device, after recalibration, could, once again, be used to heal.
Well, let me introduce you all to Sergeant Damian Prochyra.
An experienced soldier.
A veteran of many missions and an expert in comms and explosives.
Sit down.
Pilot.
The second task is the elimination of Prof. Mazur.
He created the weapon once.
He's able to reconstruct it.
We can't afford such a risk.
Yousif?
Unimportant.
He'll soon be replaced by a new psychopath with a strange mustache.
But if the opportunity arises
to get rid of him without jeopardizing the mission's primary tasks?
I'll understand.
Time's running out.
Moments ago, I received a report that the general plans to sell the weapon
to a certain African warlord and that the buyer is already on his way
to the general's base in a commandeered smelting plant.
He may arrive tomorrow.
We need to act quickly and prevent this transaction.
Any questions? How about you unsuspend my license?
We'll see what we can do.
Storm, report.
I think I've just found a comfy spot southwest of your position.
We need eyes from above.
Wilco.
The birdie is on its way.
So, this was your plan?
What, did you miss me?
We're sightseeing. And stuff.
I heard there's a military base here. Beautiful at this time of year.
Who's this guy? You know him?
You can't take the truck.
-Because? -They're expecting us.
I heard them reporting it.
What are you playing at, huh?
Yousif is holding my father there. I have to help him.
You're gonna waltz in there and say "Good morning"?
"Could you gents let my daddy go?"
We need each other.
Hi, sweetie pies. I can see you.
Dad…
Baby, everything's all right. Baby…
Why are you here?
What have you done?
Baby…
Fang?
Harbir?
What's going on there, guys? Over.
Weird interference.
Whatever they're doing upstairs is frying the electronics.
I can't see shit. I think the comms are down.
Something's wrong.
Alpha, this is Bravo. The decorations are in place.
We're heading to the evac point. Over.
Over.
Relax.
No!
I see the doc.
Waiting for a clear shot. Guys, are you there? Over.
What is this?
Why?
Who are…?
You got an order, right?
Then kill me.
Shoot me like a dog. I'm trash.
But her…
I'm begging you, she…
Come on…
A bit more, darling.
Just a bit more.
This was supposed to be a breakthrough in curing cancer.
But it all went wrong due to an anomaly.
-So, you decided to get rich? -No, they kidnapped me.
Since then, the only thing I dream of is destroying it.
Okay, guys, I've got a clear shot.
Over.
Today I had no choice.
-Fuck, Fang. Over! -I had no choice.
Oh, fuck it.
Please, save her. I've got money in Poland.
You'll get all of it. Please--
Fang, what the fuck?
I know what I'm doing.
Stay here and wait for me.
Okay, easy, Storm. One more time.
Thanks.
Come on.
Fang, they're wrapping up the toy.
Storm, they're coming for you.
Finally.
Thanks, Krzychu.
They could've given us more toys, Storm.
Harbir!
Watch out!
-I've got everyone. -Drive!
Fang.
It's me!
-I… -Breathe.
Dad said you were on the edge of the blast radius.
It's just adrenaline. It'll pass.
So Piotrek could've survived.
No, his dose was too big.
Don't think about it.
Relax. Come here.
I see I'm late to the party.
-You're not coming. -What?
The professor will come with me. You'd be arrested too.
You'll go with Harbir. He has the address of a safe house.
ANS AGENCY OF NATIONAL SECURITY
Maciej, send me the recent chopper authorizations.
Hurry up! Move it!
Well done.
Liquidation wasn't necessary. Besides, he claims he's innocent.
And you believe him?
-I believe that he deserves a fair trial. -Yes, of course.
Make sure the professor is safe.
You know why I found my calling in politics?
I'm good at reading people.
I know who they are, what they want, what to expect from them.
-I know who I can trust. -That's admirable. I wouldn't trust me.
No. This was an impossible mission.
And yet you succeeded.
Because you're good.
I've always believed in you.
Hard times are coming. We all know it.
The homeland needs people like you.
-Look. Beauty and the Beast. -No souvenirs.
I'm deleting it.
It's in the cloud.
Hey, you.
You're a soldier?
No, a fucking ballet dancer. Why?
You could have a better job.
Are you gonna fucking blabber or get me a medic?
This weapon, keep a close eye on it.
Many people died because of this device.
It can save many lives.
Hope so.
No!
Stop!
-Let me go! -Move it!
Great. Doggonit, just great.
-Hands up! -Tarnation.
Think about it.
For the first time in history, we have a weapon,
a powerful weapon that nobody knows about.
Do you really think that destroying it is the best solution?
Join us, Fang.
This is about an idea.
The idea of a nation.
The professor will go with his invention. He might be useful.
It was supposed to heal people.
This is madness!
Decide. Are you with us?
Jan Zaręba.
You're under arrest on charges of conducting illegal military operations
in Poland and abroad.
Soldiers!
Defend your homeland!
-Watch out! -Gentlemen, fire!
We're getting the fuck out of here!
Fire!
The situation's gotten very tense.
Up!
Report! What's going on there?
Fuck, get him!
I'm on your side.
Shoot. Isn't that what you're paid for?
He's over there!
Krzychu!
-Leave it! -Eat lead, motherfuckers!
Fire!
Just a bit further.
Disinfectant.
It's the best surgeon I know.
No one's gonna find out they're there.
They've found us. I'll take him.
Fang! Wake up! You need to help me.
Get in!
I won't leave them!
Fang, everything's gonna be okay.
Go!
Bull…
Hiya, sweetie pie.
How long was I out?
Long enough.
Where are Krzychu and Bull?
Don't get emotional.
Four days after announcing his candidacy, Jakub Olech, an ardent opponent of NMP,
murdered his wife.
The autopsy revealed he killed her with his own hands and teeth.
Two weeks later, a student protest.
Up until 8:30 p.m., the protesters were walking about and singing songs.
At one point, without any escalation,
a group of students showed enormous aggression.
Killed two officers, injured several dozen--
Enough. I get it.
Let's not forget this.
This is… a terrorist.
I mean, how else do you describe a monster
that storms into military exercises with only one goal in mind?
To murder, to savagely slaughter soldiers of the Polish army.
-Do we know his motivation? -Officially, no.
The investigation is still ongoing.
But you just need to look at the case to…
to know which foreign forces benefit from this.
If it helps, they're targeting me too.
-What does he want? -To be the savior.
A protector against lawlessness and foreign influence.
-Judging by the polls, he's doing well. -Sometimes, the polls can change.
Harbir.
I sent my father an encoded message. We need to wait.
Jan has people everywhere. He'll move the Soulcatcher.
So, my father's supposed to die there?
I'm working on it.
When someone really wants something, and they're in the right place and time.
Miracles.
-I let that coot trick me like a dumbass. -He tricked everyone.
Even more so.
What?
Should I not save your father?
The professor replied.
The message is gibberish. Something about does and a forest.
They're coordinates.
Each word is a digit.
The order on the page. And each page is marked by a letter.
Why "Bambi"?
Dad used to call me that.
Here.
It's a factory.
You need a one-armed bandit?
We'll keep Las Vegas in mind.
-The house always wins. -Exactly.
I have nothing to lose anyway.
I think you do.
Say hi to Damian if you see him.
I underestimated the lad.
It was quite a distance, but he hit Krzysiek with precision.
I will.
Everything is in the trunk. My people can only drive you to the spot.
-Then you're on your own. -Just how I like it.
Squad, move to sectors two and three.
Chop-chop!
Don't bust your guts.
Don't look at me.
I knew it.
And… Eliza?
Safe and sound. Relax.
They tried to study it, but the idiots just damaged it.
They want to force me to fix it, but that'll be the day.
I've got this.
Can you…?
Come on.
Stay close.
Watch out!
Fang. Your crusade is over.
The big numskull burned with his mongrels.
And that other one.
Tarnation, did that guy piss me off.
And how's your brother?
I heard
he went mad.
Hurry up!
Is it true what they're saying?
You killed him!
Your own brother.
Cain and Abel.
No!
I know you're there.
You hear me?
It's sad. Such a pity to lose a soldier like you.
But you already know…
how this will end.
No! Don't do it!
Go ahead, press the button.
What was supposed to happen already happened.
People have woken up from their stupor. And they're afraid.
And rightly.
Of terrorists, of refugees, of foreigners, of their neighbors.
Of themselves!
And they need…
A leader.
Protection.
Support.
I'm going to fix this country.
And your stunt here?
Your betrayal?
"A terrorist neutralized during a diversion."
Will it bump me up a few percent?
You've always been a step ahead of me, huh?
There's just one more thing.
Did you hear me well?
We heard everything. Loud and clear.
Fuckin' A.
Get him!
Okay, drive. Floor it.
Just don't take me home yet, okay? Those lunatics will find me there.
I love this place.
But the prices are fucking skyrocketing.
A breath of fresh, exotic air.
Prepare for a price increase.
What?
A price increase.
Are you serious?
Bananas are getting expensive.
What, Darek? The Brothers will lose it.
Just kidding. Fuck.
Don't do that again.
And get yourself better shoes.
It's Kraków, after all.
Bon appétit.
Hi, Diego. You done with rehab?
I know you're not dealing, but there are bananas in town.
Left, right, left, right Left, left, left, right, left, right
I jump over the wall and fucking go
Fuck the lawmen, they start the chase Those fuckers have lungs like divers
I spat mine out a long time ago
On the sidewalk There's my sweat and my spit
The price is too high So the adrenaline gets me fucking lit
A few miles pass As if it was Ethiopia, son
I'll fuck these morons up And will be home by dinner, mom
Left, right, left, right Fuck the lawmen
Right, left, right, left Here comes the chase
Left, right, left, right
What the fuck?
Thank you. That was great, but fuck off.
-The fuck? We're having a session. -Get the money and we'll talk.
We wired it.
Is this your recording?
I haven't closed the session!
It's mine now!
And I will add 20% extra for not calling the cops.
What cops? What 20%? Are you fucking insane?
Are you the ones who fucking stole that mic?
What mic?
Wait. He didn't tell you?
Work on your communication skills. However, there's a solution.
Call Daddy.
-Cut the crap, okay? -Hey!
Don't old gangsters help their sons?
I'll help you shut the fuck up.
Easy! Okay, it's my fault. I fucked up.
-I just wanted to borrow it. -Too bad!
-I had to send my old man to rehab. -You owe me a lot.
Tomorrow I'm getting paid for the whole month.
Then we can wipe the slate clean. Okay?
Is that okay, man?
Fuck, Flour.
Diego, okay?
Yo, it's Miki. Talk if you want. I'll listen when I feel like it.
You know what that idiot did? Snatched a mic from the studio, get it?
Okay, never mind. I'm on my way.
Who are you visiting?
One day you'll fucking destroy my lock.
I've been calling.
Quiet!
How are you, my sweeties?
Let's turn up the beat, volume up,
and let's go. Five, six, seven and…
burn, this is so delicious!
Great, girlies. Good job.
When there's pain,
there's gain!
How is it going?
That's enough for today. And now breathe, again and again.
They say this helps junkies in rehab.
Really?
And now do some stretching!
Remember that with the "MIKI 10" code, you'll get a 10% discount
off all workshops at the Yoga Beach KRK.
See ya!
I asked you for just one thing.
Not to do this.
What? If I do one line, I won't become a saint?
Stop talking so much, okay?
Why? Because you'll start tripping?
Put this on and get the fuck out of here!
Get the fuck out of here, Diego!
Stop it!
You hear me?
Dawid!
Hey, honey. Is supper ready?
What's up?
Hello?
Sorry, man. I fucked up.
You bet. Stealing a mic? Flour, you're an idiot.
Tomorrow I'm taking the stuff to Slovakia and getting paid.
To Slovakia?
Yeah. Tuman is sending the Slovaks some sacks.
What? We have to finish our album.
You'll put it in your biography. Fuck.
Sure. While drinking champagne in Wierzynek.
Or better, at Gessler's restaurant.
Okay, man, I won't fuck up this time.
-I'm crashing out now. -And meditate a bit too.
See ya, shithead.
Flour, it's ten in the morning.
Shit's going down. Go to Tuman's. He's fucking nuts.
Not a chance.
You know me. Who has most chrysanthemums?
Don't you fucking play me.
-I'm easy on you. -Sup?
Nothing.
The Slovaks are waiting, and he comes to work high.
-I just took one fucking hit. -Yeah, sure, one hit.
Fucker. Eyes the size of a quarter.
He's high on fuck knows what.
Tuman, go easy. You were high for 15 years and you're making a fuss?
I've changed. Appreciate that.
Into John Paul, so it seems.
Okay, give me the keys. I'll drive him.
See? He'll drive me.
I'll make sure Flour gets it done.
Easy, don't stress.
Right, easy or your ticker will crap out.
If my ticker craps out, you'll all end up in the street.
-Not paying you to smoke. Get to work! -Come on, boss!
2 MAN GARDENING CENTER
-How much longer? -Fucking ages.
You hear him?
You're berating the best chrysanthemums salesman
and Spiderweb here's just mucking around?
Those are Soviet blocks.
Slovak-Soviet blocks.
Slovak-Soviet-Czech blocks.
I'm going to piss myself.
Dude, I found out that your chick has a fucking impressive following.
What are we carrying?
Soil.
I know, but what's in the soil?
Pills from China.
Oh fuck, that's some piece of ass.
You want to see some ass? Here. Take a pic.
You know she has a guy? They have a pic at a pizza place.
That's her business.
Oh yeah?
See what the guy looks like.
DM him if you fancy him so much.
Isn't this the guy…?
What is this fucking mess?
Oh fuck!
You know, usually only one guy picks up the stuff.
Okay, I'm calling Tuman.
A bit too late.
Sit on your ass and don't mess up, please.
I got this.
What's that?
Family dropped by.
Bratislava?
They're making a video.
I know that guy.
You've got a mess in Poland, right?
Wasn't he in that movie…?
Like in Slovakia.
That's Rytmus.
It stinks everywhere.
If I knew the boss was coming, I'd have put on a suit.
What the fuck are you pulling? Who's this?
I told you, my bro, Diego.
It's okay.
You brought me a snitch?
-Who do you mean, fucker? -Let's take it easy and talk.
Just kidding, Polish brother.
I'm just kidding!
Look, Flour! He crapped his pants!
Fuck, yeah!
Everything's fine. Flour told me.
Oh, yeah? That I'm a snitch?
No, that you rap like mad and drop awesome beats.
I respect such artists.
Come on!
Soon, a stream of EU money will start flowing in here!
We'll turn this into a motel.
And maybe a whorehouse. What's better?
Fuck, a whorehouse. What else?
A whorehouse!
By the way,
there is one more thing.
Not musical.
Flour said that you were around once.
Do you know the right crowd in Krakow to link me up with?
Flour told you that?
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
That's good.
I need the white stuff.
Speed?
Speed?
You look like a speed guy.
Blow, brother.
We've got to run. Figure this out next time.
Who the fuck are you to tell me what and when I can figure out?
Diego, does he always stick his dick where he shouldn't?
Sometimes.
Tuman keeps calling.
I'm fucked.
This dork in Bratislava screwed up shit I guaranteed to important people.
You make some dough, I survive,
and we make big money on rap.
I can ask around.
Price?
Two-fifty.
How much can you get?
100, 150.
You're such a funny guy, Polish brother.
At least a kilo. Ideally, two.
I'll see what I can do.
One more thing.
I need it now.
Be seeing you, you Krakow snitch.
What a psycho. I forgot what a dickhead he was.
What a joke. Where do you get these wackos from?
Don't even think about it.
-About what? -If you get yourself in shit again--
Okay. Stop whining.
I was just spinning bullshit with him.
-Yeah! -Polish brother!
-Fuck! -Come on, let's fuck something up!
Time to get up!
-Need a lift? -No, I need to park it at his house.
-Okay. -Thanks.
Get some sleep.
-Sure. -We pay the studio first.
Don't pull any shit! We're finishing that record!
End of commercials.
Where are you?
Jaga. Sorry, feeling dopey, can't make it today.
Are you mad? It's my birthday.
-Next year, I promise. -What--
Kidding. I'll be there in a sec.
Make some noise for Jaga, the one who fucking invited you all here!
You're all so hyped up that I'm feeling out of place in this tee.
Butt's sticking out
Clasped and tight
A garage so big You could park a Bentley car
I burn my coal in your furnace tonight See through you with X-ray light
I burn my coal in your furnace tonight See through you with X-ray light I know you love my dough
Fuck it, fuck, fuck, fuck it all
We both know You're not here to talk
Stinks like skunk in there But you smell love in the air
Stinks like skunk in there But you smell love in the air
Always ready to escape
What?
Everybody knows our names
To hell with policemen
Even though they know our names
They can go fuck themselves
Thank you, dawgs!
Fuck, I wish I could keep on going, but I have a fuckload of work tonight.
You know what?
My man Flour and I
and other crews'll be rapping at Gibon's place on Saturday.
Are you coming?
I said, will you be there with us?
Have a fucking wild time! Music!
Jaga!
I will never ever stop Not even with a gun to my head
Get someone from the city.
Who? You were busy.
Is Flour recording?
He finished and left.
Did you miss him?
Fuck, he didn't pay you back?
Take a guess.
You know Flour.
Probably sleeping.
Understand one thing.
No one steals from me.
Put that finger away, Fatty, or I'll break it.
I don't want to because I'm in therapy. You'll have the cash in two hours.
Oh, hiya.
Hiya!
Oh, hiya, Diego! We've got a sold-out, man.
-Awesome. Have you seen Flour? -No. Tomorrow will be nuts!
Guys, get this out of here. The bar is over there.
Kira!
You seen him?
-Ready for soundcheck? -You seen Flour?
Kira! Someone's here for you!
The speakers… Filip!
Can you help me?
I'm tired. I've been looking for him all over.
He wasn't at the studio. Is he here?
Napping in the hole.
-Oh my! -Hiya.
Fucking talk.
What is it this time?
Man, I'm fucked up.
No!
Tuman gave me the dough.
I don't know how it happened, but Spider showed up
and dragged me out to this fucking roulette.
Man, I worked out a system.
And it worked. I doubled the dough.
Flour, you clown.
I don't give a fuck about your story.
-I had it in my hands. -No point talking to him.
Fucking no. He had it. Keep on laughing.
I was waiting in the studio.
That's the opening act.
Respect, gentlemen. I'm Małpen.
Yo!
-Hiya! -Sonic.
Hiya, man.
Diego, I will try to fix it somehow.
How?
Fucking tell me how.
Take out a payday loan? Or rob a church?
I've been carrying you for 15 years,
and you're still a pathological nobody!
Chill out, would you?
No.
I might be a pathological nobody.
Fuck, but I'm a real pathological nobody.
Not a poser like you!
Yeah, he's right.
Misiek, I keep topping up your phone.
You've got that beat?
No way!
-Hiya. -Hiya, you maniac!
-I got your message. -Sure, drop by.
-Baton, been a while. -Lazarus from Kraków. How was rehab?
Fine.
-You've finally lost weight. -Hi.
Don't be shy. You know each other? Miki, my chick. Diego.
-You finally did something right. -Yeah.
Do we know each other?
I don't think so. Michaela.
I'm off now.
Buy some brewskis on the way.
-And you get some pot. -Kiss.
Don't know why, I'm just happy to see you.
Really?
Gotcha!
Ever go to the hood?
-No reason to go there. -Same for me.
But if I don't get a kebab at Kasia's once a week,
I just lose it, maniac.
Jesus, Diego!
Hi, Ewelina.
Hiya.
You haven't changed your wallet since middle school?
Fuck pigs and troublemakers!
-Our friend Diego! -I see the Brothers are in shape.
How's rapping?
We follow you.
Come to my gig.
If you need any babes for your videos, just let me know.
Batonik, have some. It's all getting cold.
I'm on it.
How's your dad? Still in the same business?
We're not in touch.
A lot has changed there, so I've heard.
Not in touch? Are you going through a teenage rebellion?
Just don't go getting your period.
Batonik, where is my ketchup?
In the fridge.
Not here.
I told you not to touch my ketchup.
In the other one, in the showroom. I saw it there.
Mirek! Is there ketchup in the fridge?
-What? -In the fridge, on the door.
I have a thing.
They say you're out of the loop.
-I have this Slovak guy. -So?
-Got it? -Yes.
Let me guess.
This pal of yours from Slovakia wants to buy something?
Coke.
A kilo.
When?
That's the thing. Now.
200 per gram.
How do you think it will go down?
The usual way.
I take the stuff, go there, and a few hours later, I'm back with cash.
Should we lease you a package?
I know how it sounds, but if all goes well, they'll be regulars.
And if not?
You're asking for a lot.
It's a sure thing, uncle.
Bratislava has Vienna. With Kraków so close, they want to expand.
Or I wouldn't bother you.
Is there dessert?
Honey.
Mind your manners. We're talking.
Keep it, thanks.
She's upset.
I assume that nothing will happen, but you'd better not screw it up.
Uncle, what could go wrong?
Keep your phone on.
Baton'll call you in the morning.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Sup, baby? Calmed down?
I was about to call you.
Call your Slovak. Tomorrow we'll have a kilo of fresh flour.
No way. You didn't--
Yeah. Then the gig, and after the weekend, we do the record on our terms.
Fucking hell, just blow me and we're square.
With gusto.
Suck my dick, yo!
Are you fucking nuts?
Michaela, I wanted to do you so much.
You promised to never get yourself into shit like that.
You can't stop my instincts.
Oh, you!
You know what that psycho did?
He installed a spying app on my phone.
What?
Seriously. I left my phone at Sylwia's, so he wouldn't find me, and he still did.
How?
I don't know. He barged in there all angry,
as if I had, I don't know, robbed him
or made him hold cuck.
Hold cuck?
-Who talks like that? -I do.
But you are making him a cuckold.
So what?
I don't get why you haven't left that clown yet.
-Seriously? -No, kidding.
You'd do fine without that fuck.
Don't call him that.
You call him that.
I am allowed!
-Okay, please. -And you?
You think you're better because of your daddy?
Baton got there all by himself.
-Easy! -What do you mean, "easy"?
When there's trouble, you go to his friends.
-Cool it! -You fucking cool it!
Damn junkie.
Fuck off!
What's so funny?
Enough, fuck off to rehab.
-Hello? -The early bird catches the worm.
Parking lot in 15.
-You were giving me a lift. -I was.
Okay, got it.
You're in luck, maniac.
Pigs got our guys, and the goods don't like to just be stowed away.
-They won't be. -Good.
Remember, be back at 5:00 p.m. on the dot.
Good luck, maniac.
-Yo! -Tapczan, you're in the hood?
All my life.
I heard Waran got out. Is he at yours?
Where else?
There's a thing.
Get us Viceroy Lights on the way.
And bananas.
-And bananas. -Be there in 30.
-I'll drop by in an hour. -Okay.
Tell him there will be more.
-Twice as much. -Okay.
-Right… -Yo!
Bye. I see those fucks.
Crazy goddamn rehabilitated dork, fuck it!
And not high.
Come up here, number 27.
What number?
Two-seven.
The best shit I've snorted since the Battle of Cedynia.
If the Croatian had shit like this, I'd be a millionaire.
What Croatian?
My supplier, a dude from Dębica.
-Are we making it into three kilos? -No, two will do.
Got to keep the standards.
You could get me some of this.
Do you know what clients I have? The whole city hall snorts my stuff.
Fuck, they would shit themselves.
I can't share it.
And weren't you out of the loop?
Maybe I was, maybe I wasn't.
Oh yeah?
If this goes well, we'll have tons.
Gents, let's make that Polish blow.
Abra-fucking-cadabra!
Fuck, the blender's dead.
Hiya, rehab boy.
I know you like to stay mad, but stop it.
Stop acting nutty, because I'm worried. See you at the gig. I love you.
Last time it looked better.
No fucking around.
Like the piece?
It's about guys like us.
They fuck everything except what's really important.
That's Milosz. Make friends.
Hi, Poles!
Let's sit.
Your raps would slice into that nicely.
I rapped to it a thousand times.
Check this out.
Let's finish up and talk about rap later.
Your scales or mine?
Come on, brother!
I play you some good stuff,  and what?
You shit on it?
Okay, let's do what we need to do, and we will be--
Do you two have a plan to piss me off?
We have a gig tonight. If we don't scram, we're fucked. Get it?
A gig?
Right!
You should have said so!
Milosz!
Get them some knedle.
Two kilos, like you wanted.
Milosz!
Milosz!
Where are those knedle?
This gets me going!
Damn, we just want to go! Don't you get it?
That's something!
The Polish master wants to fucking go.
We won't take up any more of your time.
Hey! What is this shit?
Fuck! Hey!
This is how it will go down.
What do you take us for? Hicks?
You reek of trouble.
-Police! On the ground! -Diego, run!
Fuck.
Fuck!
God damn it. For fuck's sake!
Spider, move your lazy ass!
We fucked up.
They got Flour. I barely got out.
You don't get it? Get the fuck out!
I'm going. For fuck's sake.
Could the pigs have been on to Martin?
-What? -First, the Slovaks wanted to rob us.
Then the pigs came. How did they know?
You're fucking me--
We need to find Flour. Do you have anyone?
Let me explain--
Damn, let me explain!
Flour's a softie.
If they push him, he'll crap out everything.
About your pills too.
You think it's so easy, but then you cry, and someone has to clean up after you.
This isn't the time to make a Papa Smurf speech!
Do you have someone?
I'll deal with this. Get the fuck out of my sight!
Yo, it's Miki. Talk if you want. I'll listen when I feel like it.
Don't come to the gig.
-Out of here! -Why?
Get the fuck out!
Okay, Małpen, you guys go ahead with the warm-up.
Okay.
There's a problem.
Flour got high?
A really big problem.
What happened?
They grabbed him.
-Who grabbed him? -Slovak pigs.
-What? -Fuck!
Man!
Half the town comes to see you, and you pull shit like that.
What the fuck?
Oh, this is where he's hiding.
Wow.
How nice.
Rap like in the good old days.
And you complained that the young ones are clueless.
Can I have a hit?
I see that it wasn't just our stuff that you had for the Slovaks.
Oh, is this a case of miraculous multiplication?
Contaminated.
You know how it is.
You're a smart-ass.
But things happen.
Question. Why are you not fucking running to Slovakia?
-There was a setback-- -Honey.
Could you leave us alone?
Go.
Fuck!
Shut up!
Fuck! Someone ratted us out to the Slovakian pigs!
-Should I off him? -Not yet.
Fuck!
Easy now, Diego, my boy.
Out of consideration for your father and our past.
Maybe we need to tell Daddy about his son's problems.
You have until morning. That's about 12 hours.
Twelve fucking hours.
You will stay here and watch him.
Make sure our boy doesn't pull any shit.
Me?
Ah, one more thing, Diego, my boy.
You owe us for the whole thing. For the new mix as well.
Why even mention it?
-He knows. He's no dummy. -Jaceńku.
Fuck.
Come, Józek. We might catch the end of the game.
Wishing you a good night, then.
Bye!
Fucking awesome.
Fuck it!
You have a bleeding hand, and me a heart. My chick's cheating on me.
You know how it hurts?
I filmed the fucker, but the angle's off. Look.
There's also footage from the camera at the front desk.
I'll get it after the weekend.
Something tells me I know the guy.
Why has this happened to me?
-Give me your hand. -What are you doing?
This isn't GTA. We can't run around town with all that stuff.
I'm not going to run at all. I have to hit the stage.
We'll do our thing, and then you sing.
This is your pals' joint? You trust them, yeah?
Then so do I, sort of.
Diego, what the fuck did you guys pull?
Where's Flour, Diego? Where is my brother?
Calm down, Kira!
-Calm down. -Why is he laughing?
Look at me, Kira!
This is no joke.
Get out of here.
I've got this.
Let's go.
Cool. I'm driving.
It's been almost two years, and everything is her way.
Yo, it's Diego. There's a thing. Are you in?
And now she comes up with those castings.
I bet it's that fucker.
Oil paint, white, two liters.
Those directors just want to see some ass, so they organize castings.
No point in talking.
I just have a good thing.
I'll hunt that fucker down and…
No, Monday is too late. Now or never.
Fine.
Laters.
So, are there any rules or not? You tell me.
I don't know about that stuff.
You don't know about chicks?
I don't know about your yapping. Shut up and drive.
Tapczan. I need to contact your supplier.
The Croatian? Sure, get over here.
Yo, it's Miki. Talk if you want. I'll listen when I feel like it.
There's trouble. Where are you?
-Diego. -I need to talk to Tapczan.
I'm back in the game, making serious bacon.
I'll fucking kill somebody.
I want to deal with your Croatian.
Shooting at a dog? Are you fucking nuts?
Fuck you, squealer!
I'm in a hurry. I have a serious deal.
I need the Croatian's number.
Maniac! Respect.
-No fucking way! Baton in my crib. -Take your arm off me, maniac.
Hey, dude, who rules the city now?
Ask your chick.
You want some water?
And do you want a beating?
What are those toys? What is this? Plastic?
What's that? You should've tied up a dwarf.
What's that? You should've tied up a dwarf. CROATIAN
You forgot you had a sister? Jarek?
What the fuck?
-Guys, are you for real? -No, I stabbed my hand for fun.
I have a fat deal, so call that fucking Croatian!
This is fucked up. There is no Croatian.
Are you fucking nuts? You said you'd take a pic and let me go!
There is no Croatian. Just this friend of mine…
Fucking hell!
…a chemist from AGH. He sometimes makes… Sorry, man.
Hey!
Dude, easy.
Damn, man, easy.
Don't flip. We'll figure it out.
Fucking losers.
Fuck, BB balls! Are you nuts?
Are you fucking mental?
Fuck!
Don't chuck the pad out!
Oh fuck!
It's that fuck who's been shooting at dogs!
You fucks!
Fuck, Baton, get the fuck out of here!
What are you wrecking the place for?
Fuck, get the fuck out of here!
When's the pick-up?
But--
What, you want me to go there all sweaty after the gym?
Okay, I'll put him on.
For you.
Honey, I wouldn't normally butt in, but Baton says you're not doing so well.
Everything's under control.
You got your chance. There won't be another one.
Let's not exaggerate. The boy is doing fine.
I like you, and I have some good news.
We assumed that, due to circumstances beyond your control, you might fail.
You'll pay us back another way.
Everyone will be happy, and maybe we'll cooperate.
Batonik, Krzysiu is waiting.
Kid.
You get in there through the gate on the street side, yeah?
I have this clicker in the garage… and the gate opens.
One more thing, the alarm is off.
Go to the upper floor
and keep going left.
There'll be a guy sleeping with a chick.
Don't bother them unless you have to.
-There's a closet-- -Fuck are you on about?
The fuck I'm on about?
In the closet, there is a safe.
Baton, what fucking safe?
Hasn't he fucking seen a safe in his life?
Call the Brothers.
Maniac,
our Krzysiu here can do this instead of you.
But then he would have to off you.
Your choice.
I always can.
Here's the bag and the gear.
Chuck everything from the safe into this. Got it?
And it's all good.
To take the edge off.
Snort.
Quick--
-Look, tough guy. -Hey.
-Rapper! -Brave guy!
Quiet.
Easy or I'll fucking kill you. Where's your boyfriend? Upstairs?
Quiet. Shut the fuck up.
Zibi, give this kid whatever he wants!
Pretty good.
But you don't know who you just bumped into.
Or you'd be shitting your pants.
So, how old are you? Twenty, thirty?
I have a son. Same age as you.
But not like you. You are tough.
He is a pussy.
Fuck this job. Work for me, and I might not fucking kill you.
I forgot the combination.
What do we do now?
Easy.
I'll give you what you want.
I'll fucking kill you, you shit!
Diego…
-What is it? -He knows. I've found the GPS.
Fuck, he's been following me all this time.
What GPS?
In my bag.
Where are you?
Gas station in the hood.
-Dawid, I love you. -Wait for me there, baby.
I love you too.
Miki!
It's okay.
What happened?
-Nothing. -What?
I'm fine. Miki, did he hurt you?
-What the fuck? -Miki. Let's go.
Miki, sit down.
What happened?
He locked me up at home and took my phone.
Sylwia let me out.
-Show me the GPS. -No.
I chucked it. It looked like a SIM card.
Fucking hell.
How did he know it was me? You've never been to mine.
I don't know. I have no idea.
-Fuck! -What the fuck is going on?
God.
Where was this GPS?
I don't know, in my bag.
Fuck me.
Come with me to Milan. Please. Sylwia's mum is there. We'll crash there.
-Fuck. -I talked to her.
I stole some cash from home.
Enough for now.
Do you hear me, Diego?
-Fuck! -Come on, this is a gas station.
Fuck off!
Say something. Talk to me. Just say anything.
BUSINESSMAN BUYS SPORTS CLUB -You hear me? I'm begging you. -Hold on.
-You hear me? I'm begging you. -Hold on. SAUSAGE KING, KNOWN FOR HIS PASSION FOR NIGHTLIFE

Jaga. "AN EXEMPLARY FATHER BY DAY"
We'll go. But you need to do one thing for me.
Go to the studio and buy our recordings from Fatty.
-Got it? -Yes.
No matter what. I owe it to Flour.
It's okay now. We're together.
I love you. It'll be fine.
Let's go.
Diego, get down lower.
-Lower. -Fuck, Diego, people are crazy.
Kira, lock up the hole, and break the key. Baton can't get inside.
Who? What Baton?
The dick I came with. Neck tattoo. Remember?
Got it. But get your ass over here.
I'll be there in an hour.
Fuck. I think they are tailing us.
Miki, don't freak out.
It's a taxi.
-Jaga? -I'm by the stage. When are you on?
Do something for me.
Just say the word.
I have to see your old man.
My old man?
I never ask you for anything.
Hold on.
By the stadium in 15 minutes.
Thank you.
Go to Sylwia's and relax.
I'll join you as soon as I can.
Hold on. Spread your arms.
-Hi, Jaga. -Let him in.
-To see Daddy? -Yes.
Wait a bit.
-He's busy. Do you know him? -Yes.
-He's new. -He's my friend.
A friend?
But after all those scandals?
Man, last year,
we launched two new clubs in those re-privatized buildings.
Get some girls
and the English and French will spend a fortune in there.
And you get the girls from Skawina or somewhere else.
-Where are you from, star? -Liszki.
Wonderful. Very good.
You see, the offer is here today, and tomorrow it could be off.
Jaga's here.
Oh, my daughter!
Come, come here.
Raise a toast with us to the town that is so dear to our hearts.
Gentlemen, please.
-Cheers! -Cheers!
Dad, this is Diego.
Oh, the artist.
Rapper.
-So sing something for us. -Dad!
What?
Rap used to be good. Firma, Intoksynator. Now it's all crap, not rap.
Kids get tattoos and make videos with those plastic AKs.
Have you ever shot an AK, huh?
Kidding, my man, just fucking kidding.
Come, sit.
Eat something.
What's with the hand?
I scratched myself.
Thank you for the meeting, sir.
Not sir, for fuck's sake. My name's Bogusław.
Diego.
Ah, Diego Armando, is it?
Maradona.
Great timing. We're looking for investors
for a nightclub chain in Kraków. Are you in?
No, I'm looking for an investor
for this.
Piotruś!
Yes?
Take the girls and show our guests the new VIP box in the fan zone.
Sure.
Ladies and gentlemen, follow me.
-Jaga. -Seriously?
Just don't go on forever.
In retail, this goes for 400.
I can sell it for 250. I have two kilos.
You feeling all right?
You barge in here and show me this iffy shit.
It's not iffy.
Do I look like a sucker?
Do you really think I'm a sucker?
Looks like you do, since you dragged my daughter into this.
Fuck!
-Listen… -"Listen," what?
You think I don't know what's going on? That I can't work it out?
You're fucking up my mood!
You are fucking me over in front of my friends, my daughter.
Hold your horses, man.
Hold on.
Hold on.
This is how I see it.
If I don't buy this from you,
my daughter will get mad and'll be nagging me for a month.
But if I do buy it from you, I'll get a visit from men in uniform,
and I don't feel like getting annoyed for no reason. Got it?
-Got it. -So, why the fuck are you here?
-Because I respect you. -Fuck off.
-Who did you nab this from? -No one. I had a deal.
Cards on the table. Go!
What do you have to lose?
Father, he's going to play tonight.
Who from?
Jews? Sharks?
The Brothers.
You're fucking over the Brothers?
-I'm not fucking anyone over. -Then what are you doing?
What you've been doing for 20 years.
Oh, please.
Okay, then, here are the cards on the table.
An MP's son leaves it all behind and starts a sausage business.
Why? Because he got fed up with the suit?
And that football hooligan crap,
is that for the money? You know why you do this?
It fucking excites you.
Same with the media. And the shit that they pour all over you.
And 5,000 mouths howling at each game that you're a sausage dick.
That's when you're in a fucking VIP box and you have them by their throats
and tell them what to do with losers.
We're not so different, Boguś.
We are no different here.
The need for clusterfuck never stops. You know this.
That's why you haven't told me to fuck off.
Where did you get this fucker from?
Sorry, Diego.
Cocky tough guy, aren't you?
Okay, fuck it.
200 per gram.
Don't negotiate. You won't get a better deal tonight.
You know what, Boguś?
I will.
Don't be so jumpy, my man.
Check your cholesterol level.
So, how much?
Stop playing games.
You know.
Take the guys and tell Piotruś to get the cash ready.
And you stick to rap.
It's better to rap about it than live it.
Baton is here. Our guys tried, but he's huge.
Gentlemen, sort it out.
Strong guy!
-You are training in karate. -Shut your trap.
Suck my dick with your trap.
Who's that guy? I think I've seen him somewhere before.
It doesn't
matter anymore.
Everything matters.
Maybe we could go out sometime.
Jaga…
A weekend getaway. Wherever you want.
Jagunia… hey.
I lost a bet. I thought you wouldn't show up, but here you are.
Yo, what the fuck is this?
This
is not for kids.
Hiya, Kraków!
Make some noise for my pal Flour who got busted by the pigs!
I'm going for broke
Because everything else is not worth shit
I once promised my mother Not to get jailed by a copper
And not end up as a mental patient, no
I'll bounce off the shit on the bottom
And go down a path That will make you proud
That's my last deal, mom
I'm fucking sorry, but I need the dough To finish this fucking album, mom
Hey! And I don't know any other way
What can I do When everybody else does it too?
We had no role models We watch our fathers
On a rampage when They were like dogs in a pen And I don't know the end
I don't give a rat's ass About the heroes made of brass
I'll give my life for a stroke of luck I can even fucking break my back
I'll dive headfirst Because I want to succeed
For those few moments and my few peeps
I'll break every lock and every gate
And you stay fucking quiet Fill my void
Or disappear like a ghost
And leave sadness away
I can't fucking run away from this anyway
I don't want to sleep or eat I'm hungry and tired
I see a goal and go for it Through twisted tracks
Through twisted faces And sniffing hounds
I can't be calm And not fucking wasted
I don't want to sleep or eat I'm hungry and tired
I see a goal and go for it Through twisted tracks
Through twisted faces And sniffing hounds
I can't be calm And not fucking wasted
Black Marias on my back But my shoes are made for track
Shove this flour up your ass, dickhead.
That was foul shit! So fucking foul!
I thought you would never wake up.
Someone switched your stuff?
You're lucky to be alive.
How is Flour?
The pigs raided our crib.
They're trying to link him with Slovak gangsters.
Diego!
You fucking put my brother in the slammer.
I'll make some calls.
You need to hide.
And you?
We have an uncle in Tarnów.
I'll stay there for a while and we'll see.
-Take this. -Fucking Baton.
-Only he had a reason. -Baton?
Which one?
Okay, you hold it.
Promise you'll hide somewhere.
Just this.
Disappear.
There's sun, different people.
We'll start from scratch, without all those fuckheads.
Without anyone.
I bought tickets from Katowice. Sylwia'll give us a ride.
Okay. Did you get the drives from the studio?
Miki?
-What? -Did you get our tracks from the studio?
Well…
For fuck's sake!
-I was scared. They're looking for you. -I asked you to do one thing.
Just get over here. Please.
When everything calms down, Sylwia'll handle this. I promise.
Okay, I'm going to pick you up. Fuck!
Change the address.
Studio at Budryk Street.
Get your shit together and come here.
Fucking hell, Diego, you're alive?
Here's our hero!
I've seen it on YouTube.
Yeah, fuck. Awesome gig.
Thanks.
…a shitload of…
-Diego. Hi, dude! -Hi.
-What did you do? -You should have been there.
We're recording all the time.
But tell me this, was it all planned?
-Sure. -I told you!
Awesome, man.
-Punches, flour. -You know it went viral?
-Fuck, I had no idea. -Awesome, really, lit.
You remember the thing in Nowy Sącz? That didn't go viral.
-No one recorded it. -Well…
We finished the record.
Hey, come to our studio.
-Show-off. -Do you have more?
Does he have photos?
You're talking shit. Let's start.
Diego!
-Not now, Spider. -Listen.
That casino thing,
I told Flour not to play and to pay off Fatty,
but he totally lost it, man, like a demon or something.
He needs help.
We'll talk later. Yes, 25 years.
You should've kept your eye on it.
I didn't sign any IOU.
Yes. No, there wasn't any IOU…
I said, the boss isn't in!
-I'll wait. -The waiting room is downstairs.
But I prefer to wait here.
Hey there! Excuse me! Who are you?
Grab it and run.
-Excuse me! -Okay, Miki. Got it, go!
Where is your car?
Miki! -What? -Where's the car?
Over there.
Drive.
-You sure no one followed you? -Yes.
Fuck, fucking Baton.
Fucking drive, Miki.
Drive! Floor it, Miki!
-I'll kill the fucker. -No, Mik…!
Oh fuck. What was that?
Fuck's sake.
Man.
Oh fuck!
Is he alive?
No fucking idea. Fucking walked in front of the car.
Go, call an ambulance.
What fucking ambulance?!
-We need the ER! You want him to croak? -To the car!
Put him in the back!
His leg is bent.
Careful.
Crazy.
Guys, Diego's here.
-Come! -Help us.
-Take him. -Have you totally lost it?
-What is it? -Fucker sold us to the Slovakian pigs.
Slovak said that either I sell you out or he'd hang me.
You ripped him off. That police stunt was bullshit!
What the fuck?
They were phonies, not pigs, guys from Poland.
They took his cash and speed. He's going to fuck you up.
You are dead, loser.
-That's how you fucking planned it? -You've lost it. You're fucking nuts.
So fucking talk now. Where is Flour?
And the coke? And the fucking money?
Diego! Are you fucking nuts?
-Don't touch me! -I don't know.
Did you swap the blow for flour?
The GPS bug loses connection outside the town.
I don't give a fuck where you were.
Someone swapped your coke for flour?
As for Flour, if you ever see him, if he's somehow still alive,
remind him that he has to pay me back by the end of the week.
And for the car. Or I'll look for him with Martin.
Friends, for fuck's sake.
We're out.
Fuck.
Miki!
-What's the plan? -Wait behind the greengrocer's.
That's not necessary at all.
Jesus, I haven't seen you in ages, Dawid.
I have no idea where Michał is. He's got so many businesses.
Exactly. He lent me some money.
Michał always speaks so highly of you.
The two of you were like peas in a pod.
Go on, help yourself. Don't be shy.
Mr. Grześ, I want to give it back to him. It's a hefty sum.
So call him.
He's not answering.
Maybe there's no service there.
Where? In Tarnów?
Where?
Kaśka said she was going to her uncle's in Tarnów.
-What uncle? -I thought Michał was with her.
No, they are sitting in those garages.
The ones on Kolejowa Street?
Yeah.
Michał's cousin, Łukasz, was in prison in Tarnów.
They released him. About a week ago.
Excuse me. That must be the neighbor.
So, why would she go there?
And in that spot,
there are always some issues. With reception, with the power.
Probably because of the construction work nearby.
Maryśka!
Some men are here.
Fucking…
-Who are you? -Get off me! Take your hands off me!
-Hey, you! - Come on, Mom.
I respect the elderly, but moan one more time and I'll break your bones.
Right?
Your son borrowed a lot of money from me.
He gambled it away at a casino.
He had time to pay me back, but the deadline is long gone.
And so it happens that this property was used to secure the loan, so sorry,
get the fuck out.
I don't fucking believe it!
Of all the loan sharks in Kraków, Flour went to you?
Dawid, do you know him?
You can show off, Dad.
Take everything of value.
Touch anything and I'll fuck you up.
Whenever Flour borrowed money from me, he talked about your music projects.
And your great friendship. Show them off now.
-Or is there nothing to show? -Why did you give him the dough?
Because I knew he'd drag you down.
Finally, you would become who you really are.
My son.
Fuck…
Invite me to your new crib.
I'll admit, fucking awesome. Just like your new ho.
You like bimbos like that? You picked that beige carpet yourself?
What is it?
If you want to know who told me where the safe was,
here he is, that fucking creep.
Are you both fucking her? Or do you show him your stashes?
The fuck is he saying?
What is this bullshit?
No!
Who?
The Brothers.
They forced me!
Fuck.
I don't know what shit you're in,
but one "I'm sorry" will do,
and I'll get you out of this.
-Fuck! -What?
Diego?
Say something.
Hello, hey.
I'm sorry.
For fucking up. I don't want to be like this.
Go to Kolejowa Street.
Be careful.
Okay, check it.
Hold on.
Got it.
Look!
Diego.
Well, look.
Look at this.
Diego.
He's bought tickets to London. For tomorrow. 6:00 a.m.
Kira is going too.
If you were Flour, had a few hours to kill and a ton of cash, where would you hide?
-Think. Where? -I don't know. I don't know the guy.
Fuck.
Spider.
What?
-Hello. -Spider.
Where did you go to the casino? Tell me where.
-Bronowice. -Thanks.
-Stay with me. -Holy fuck. Flour. I knew it.
-Can you navigate? -Go to Armia Krajowa Street.
Go, Miki, go.
Wiedeńska Street. Where to now?
I told him that day in the studio not to gamble.
Okay. Which number was it? Tell me.
The one with a slanted roof. I think 12.
Or 14. Fourteen.
-Which one? -Fourteen. Enter through the garage.
-Say you're there to see Bernie. -Look.
2 MAN GARDENING CENTER
Okay, got him, yo!
Fuck.
Diego, I'm with you.
-Hiya. -Hi.
I'm here to see Bernie.
Sure. Welcome.
Roulette or Texas?
Both.
Want a new bandage?
No, thanks.
Have fun, but keep it polite.
Would you like a drink?
No, thanks.
New bets, please.
Yo! Bet for me too.
Fuck. Look how well I'm doing.
Betting is over.
Where's the stuff, Flour?
Fucking sold out.
Ten seconds and I'll fuck you up.
Twenty-three red.
This was my system. I had to lose first so that I could win now.
5,000 on red.
-Any problems, gentlemen? -No. Everything's okay.
Everything's okay.
Fuck. Give me a sec, and we'll be leaving this place loaded.
How could you sell me out, you fucker?
-Forget about Martin. -Look at me.
I've known Slovaks for ages. It's an investment.
Triple this, pay off the Brothers, and split the rest.
50:50.
-Man, fuck. -I made 20K, look.
-Bets are off. -Fucking awesome idea with Tarnów.
Fucking master criminal.
I'll explain, just let me play.
-Grześ, fuck, everything's okay. -Grzesiu.
Okay. Man, I was in such a mess. You can't imagine the shit I was in.
And you came up with this stunt. This was my last chance.
Look how well I'm doing.
-No way! You see? -Twelve red.
Fuck, do you trust me now?
Diego, fuck, do you trust me?
Diego, fuck--
Go, Miki, go!
You got it?
Did you do it?
Lajkonik FM.
They are coming. Let's get the fuck out of here.
Filip Zieliński is here with the news.
Five firefighting units are battling a fire at a car dealership.
As officer in charge Tomasz Bogunia has told us,
its owners could have been inside,
brothers Jacek and Józef Strach, two businessmen from Krakow.
Unofficial findings seem to point to arson.
The motive, a power struggle in the drugs business.
Brother!
You're really talented.
We could have done things together.
What a waste.
When you got pissed at me that time, I figured you out.
You Polish snitch!
Those fake cops?
An elementary school trick.
But you should have killed us then!
And now we'll kill you.
I have your dough.
It wasn't me!
Did you hear that, Milosz?
It wasn't him!
You Poles!
It's never your fault, only your brother's.
You're always divided.
You'll never see eye to eye, right?
Chill out, brother. Or you'll drop faster.
And I want to show you something.
Quiet, little girl.
BROTHERS
Well?
Went crying to your daddy after all?
So I have two pieces of news. Both are bad.
You burned Józek.
Are we attracted by the mystery behind it?
The secrets hidden in the dark?
Or the dangers lurking around every corner?
Toledo steel. A beautiful thing.
So, Petersen, do you need any help?
No.
I'm off, then! This time the treasure will be mine!
BASED ON THE NOVEL OF THE SAME NAME BY ZBIGNIEW NIENACKI
The first rays of sunshine
appear in Liepāja at two o'clock.
Five o'clock.
Seven o'clock.
And what if you stopped the sun at two o'clock now?
The cross.
I thought we would watch the sunrise together.
In that case, adiós, Señor Tomasz.
Tomek!
So, who needs help now?
Watch out!
Fine, you win.
The Red Army carted away treasures from all over Europe.
The ones they couldn't cart away, they hid.
I found some letters from a soldier to a fence.
He wrote about a lighthouse in Liepāja
and that the light stops here at 2:00 a.m.
What?
See for yourself.
Yes.
You wanna play, Petersen?
Bye!
MR. CAR AND THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR
NATIONAL MUSEUM
The cross leads to the treasure,
probably comprising unbelievable riches brought back by the Crusaders.
The authenticity of the cross is proven by de Molay's signature on the ruby.
Amazing. Do you mean me or the cross?
What treasures does the cross lead to?
The Holy Land was a melting pot of religions and cultures.
Its vaults housed thousand-year-old artifacts,
priceless objects, and relics of unusual powers.
Whatever de Molay found there must be extraordinarily valuable.
Please.
Did he bring the treasure back to Europe with him?
After returning to Europe, de Molay was accused of heresy
by the king of France, Philip the Fair, and then imprisoned and burned.
What happened to the treasure?
Legend has it that
de Molay hid the treasure, and the cross leads to it.
The face of the cross features Latin characters,
and under the horizontal beam, there's an inscription,
"Ubi thesaurus tuus, ibi cor."
Meaning?
Meaning "your treasure is where the heart is."
The text cuts off.
A part of the cross is missing.
Forgive me, but the treasure won't find itself.
Thank you for coming in such large numbers.
Excuse me!
You can't decode the cross and find the treasure, can you?
Of course I can.
The treasure will be on display in this museum soon.
Thank you.
Hurry, Mr. Tomasz. The boss doesn't have much time.
Don't worry, Pieniążek. Gierymska can wait.
How are your wife and kids?
Thank you very much. I still have neither.
But I don't feel lonely, and you won't either.
Excuse me.
Why do you search for treasure?
It's a compulsion, right? Is it about your ego?
The press conference is over.
I prefer direct communication.
I'm writing a piece on treasure and its attraction.
-Will you give me an interview? -You want to talk to a narcissist?
You read my articles. Do you like them?
Apparently, I'm only able to love artifacts.
Then maybe it would be worth giving an interview over a cup of coffee
to let people see your other side.
I prefer artifacts.
Do you know why I search for treasure?
Because I'm not a quitter.
Unlike you, from what I've heard.
Pieniążek!
Hey! What are you doing? You were supposed to peel potatoes.
Get to work.
Jeez, he can't even peel right.
TEMPLAR TREASURE
Holy smokes! The lost cross of de Molay!
Hey, orphan boy!
Why are you here?
This morning you told me to get lost, or you'd puke.
You're reading while we're in "piernament" conflict with the Reds?
Permanent?
Don't interrupt me. That too.
You want to be a kid and read newspapers your whole life,
or a man and belong to a real men's club? My club.
When I become a man, won't I start balding?
No.
We don't go bald here.
-Then I want to be in the club. -Attention!
Yuck. What's that smell?
Humanity.
Give me that. Or yesterday's pea soup.
All right, the sooner we finish,
the sooner we join the men's club.
Wonderful, can't wait.
I hate to disappoint you, compadre, but you can't join it.
You already belong to a club. The losers' club.
-You've been sent here for being losers? -And why were you sent?
For being a woman.
We never had it easy in this country.
One, two…
Five Reds from the east.
-We have to warn our guys. -Our guys?
The guys who made us swim in poo?
It's our poo, too, and no Red shall spit in its face.
Maybe they'll finally like us.
We were defeated by the Reds again. All because of those losers.
Hey, suckers!
Your next two weeks look very smelly.
Very smelly.
I've had enough!
I'm under no illusions. Only the fourth wave of feminism will bring change.
Easy, mon ami.
-Let's just change the club's name. -No! We have to find the treasure.
Look!
The cross of the Templar Grand Master de Molay.
It's the key to finding their treasure.
It's supposed to contain incredible riches found during the Crusades.
Wow!
Mr. Tomasz is awesome. He's found many treasures.
Recently, in the sea.
Pesky journalists, huh? They won't leave you be.
Pieniążek, tell me what the boss is planning for me.
She'll tell you herself.
You tell me.
A partner.
You barely made it back home last time.
The boss is worried.
Vacation!
The last mission was basically a vacation.
Give me a harder assignment, boss, or I'll get rusty.
-Any idea where the treasure is? -The inscription is the key.
I need to find out whose heart it refers to.
Do you know her?
She was at the presentation of the cross. She calls herself Laima.
The Baltic goddess of fate in the form of an old woman. Cute.
She owns a holiday resort in Miłkokuk in Podlachia.
She claims to have descended from the Yotvingians,
and she collects artifacts related to them.
If it's about her owning a resort,
and you think I need a vacation, then no, thanks.
The last mission was a vacation. She wants the treasure
and claims that the de Molay cross is not the only one.
Check her out. Be discreet. She's staying at the Bristol Hotel.
I found your man.
Gaspar Felippe.
A jewelry thief born in Buenos Aires.
He's so good, he's earned the nickname "Adiós"
since he left everyone else behind.
He'll have to change his nickname, then. A couple of years ago, he disappeared
but is very much alive and taking the lives of others instead.
Dohnal from the Prague Museum.
Eveline from the Belgian Archaeologists' Association.
Metz from Denmark.
Killing off his rivals.
He's not alone.
You could use some help.
I have you and my car.
It'll do. Have a good trip.
Take care, Pieniążek.
WELCOME PARENTS
HEADQUARTERS
Holy smokes!
We call it a totem here. It's like a symbol of a tent.
Hey.
Come on!
No, it's just…
What's wrong with him?
DEAR GUEST
Neman Glassworks from the interwar period.
Designed by Morawski.
Beautiful.
Oh, a fake. Perfect!
Tomek, I really have better things to do
than saving your life all the time.
I could've handled them.
I was here first.
"You're invited to lunch in the hotel restaurant."
-"Tomorrow." -At 12:12 p.m.
Have you got any family?
We're not partners yet, and you're proposing a relationship?
I've got a daughter.
For the first time, I regret not spending more time with her.
But on the other hand, I feel that now I could really offer her something.
You're afraid. And you know something.
Who are they?
A secret organization.
Intelligence agents. I don't know.
But I know about the assassinations of treasure hunters.
Tomek, treasure-hunting is no longer a game.
So, the cross doesn't lead to treasure?
In the Holy Land, de Molay discovered something with immense power.
Something that could change the course of history.
Everyone wanted it. Kings, popes. Everyone.
Philip the Fair arrested de Molay. He wanted the treasure.
And he got some part of it.
Why did the Hundred Years' War ensue only after Philip's death?
Because Europe was afraid of him.
His part of the treasure could annihilate entire armies.
Think what the whole treasure could do.
The treasure is a weapon?
Weapon, plague, magic…
I don't know.
I know one thing.
It's a powerful force that could destroy Europe.
Tomek,
give it up.
Petersen, you're getting old.
So, maybe we could team up?
We're not doing too bad.
You know that I always work alone.
I'll see you tomorrow. At 12:12 p.m.
Petersen.
Give him happiness…
Are you coming?
…light and peace.
Now!
So after passing through death…
Now!
…he will participate with all the saints in the eternal light…
as you promised to Abraham and his descendants.
Amen.
Hit him.
Hit him.
And now apologize.
Apologize to my boy.
I'm sorry.
He forgives you.
No more mistakes from now on.
You'll eliminate anyone who gets in the way.
Is that clear?
Are we snacking?
What?
No, it's a precautionary measure. Good thinking.
A camp full of adolescent boys isn't the safest place.
-What are you doing here? -You've been here all day. Alone.
I've been thinking about the treasure--
Without us?
You were with your parents. I didn't want to bother you.
Why? Did yours not come?
Yeah, about seven years ago.
Listen.
Don't you ever say that you didn't want to bother us.
We are a team, and we do everything together.
FAMOUS TREASURE HUNTER PETERSEN KILLED
NATIONAL MUSEUM ARCHEOLOGIST SURVIVES CAR BOMB ATTACK!
It's 12:12.
I respect punctual people.
And I don't respect people who blow up cars
with my friends inside.
I abhor violence.
But I sometimes forgive breaking into hotel rooms.
I respected Petersen.
I was hoping the three of us would talk here.
Why should I trust you?
I ordered hot cocoa for you. I heard you're fond of it.
I prefer the Templar cross to cocoa.
You claim that the de Molay cross isn't the only one.
Sounds like a bluff.
There's a legend passed down in my family from generation to generation…
about a Teutonic Knight who left a cross in my ancestors' land.
Identical to the one you found.
Still smells like bluffing.
The Teutonic Knights and the Yotvingians didn't get on so well.
Exactly. This Teutonic Knight feared for his life and knew
that Philip the Fair wouldn't look among the Yotvingians.
You're not the only one who knows that Philip wanted the treasure,
but my ancestors hid the cross
and provided a clue to their descendants.
The museum can pay for the cross.
I don't even know where it is.
But I can help if you lead me to the treasure.
And share it with me.
A competition?
Please.
As the goddess of fate, you should know that I'll find the treasure on my own.
Whatever it is.
Thank you for the cocoa. Goodbye.
In summer, we usually seek rest or look for amazing adventures or love.
But this year, we will all be searching for treasure.
It's a warm summer, with temperatures hitting 30 degrees over the last few days,
but ever since Mr. Tomasz found the cross of the Knights Templar,
things have been heating up even more.
Get yourself a belt knife. He wanted to play with a pocketknife.
Not again! Now you, Pear.
Today, the temperature in our studio will rise even higher
thanks to journalist Anka Modzelewska,
who's got a scoop for us about the Templar treasure.
Quiet. Do you hear that?
Please don't keep us in suspense.
-It turns out that the Templar cross… -A lucky twist of fate.
As a man of science, I don't believe in fate.
As a feminist, I believe it's a patriarchal concept.
The mysterious Laima invites everyone to a competition
to find another cross leading to the treasure.
You just need to get
to the Yotvingian resort in Miłkokuk before sunset.
Now anyone can get the treasure, not just the overrated Mr. Tomasz, who--
I was listening.
Uncle,
what were they thinking?
Surely, Adiós is already on the way.
Calm down.
You can be in Miłkokuk in five hours.
Have a drink.
Already added.
Thank you.
Karol…
I fixed the dents as much as I could. I welded all the holes up.
I put in a new battery
and added a couple of new gadgets.
-Shall I show you how it all works? -No, I'm not a child.
But this, can this be folded away easily?
You never know when it might come in handy.
I know. Never.
Mrs. Gierymska is worried about you.
Tell her to stop worrying. I've got back seats now.
Seems like she has other ideas.
A personal trainer? I don't have time for things like that.
I've heard a lot about you.
It's an honor and a great responsibility to be your partner.
Franz.
Responsibility is a stressful thing.
-You are hereby released of it. -The director insisted.
I'd listen to her.
What is this thing? Does it even run?
I don't actually know.
First, it will need a push.
Come on.
Faster, Mr. Franz.
I'm sure he just wants to warm up the engine.
-Right? -That "thing" doesn't need warming up.
Thanks, Uncle!
Aren't they going to look for us?
If life has taught me anything, it's that nobody ever looks for losers.
But we have to lay low. And we need code names.
Great idea.
Kids on the block called me Squirrel. And I kinda like it.
-Squirrel? All right. -What were you called?
Moron, idiot, trash, and stinker.
Stinker sounds best.
Don't you dare open it up, buddy.
Did you know tailing requires discretion?
It's true. He's observant and witty.
I hope you don't get your information from the Afternoon Courier, Ms…
I've got other sources.
Good. Because the media is lying.
Which massively overrated you and trusted you for no reason.
I beg your pardon? I always make eggs the morning after.
This time, there might not be a morning after.
WX 0001. This one will stop.
Not this one. It's the tenth.
According to American scientists, one in ten drivers is a serial killer.
You can call me Mentor.
How does he see all that?
Eagle Eye.
We'll call you Eagle Eye.
A real Mata Hari.
What's so exciting about treasure hunting?
To find out, I decided to venture into the unknown.
I didn't know what would await me,
but I felt that I should trust fate.
I was led by a strong feeling that destiny would guide me.
-Is it stopping? -Yes.
Be quiet.
Ma'am, our friend here needs urgent help.
-She's coming. -Very urgent.
He suffers from trichotillomania,
and he needs to be taken to a special clinic in Miłkokuk.
Miłkokuk? That's far. What's this trichotillomania?
I'll tell you.
It's a condition involving the urge to pull out one's hair.
Interesting.
-Look here. -Let's talk woman to woman.
I'll be honest because honesty is the best policy.
Our scoutmaster sent us to Miłkokuk on a secret mission.
That sounds a lot more believable.
I reckon it's about the Templar treasure?
How does she know?
I'm going there too.
So, we're competitors?
How about a team?
Who are you?
I'm a journalist. I'm writing a story about why people search for treasure.
You were the one who announced the competition on the radio.
Anka Modzelewska!
The first female reporter for the Afternoon Courier!
And before that, a fencing prodigy!
Let's leave it at "reporter." A team.
The clown's mine.
I've got more toys here. Leave the lady alone!
I warned you.
It was you.
What? She attacked you.
Go after her!
Maybe it's my journey that answers the question,
why do we need treasure?
It's not about the destination but the journey itself.
I feel it when I discover amazing places,
meet extraordinary people, discover myself.
Hey! What?
Maybe it's not the treasure
but the adventure leading to it that is truly magical.
Is everything all right?
Mr. Tomasz.
One minute and 20 seconds left. After that, nobody gets in.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
Heavy traffic.
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
That's what your boys said.
They're in a ditch now. Give it up.
There's no room for violence here.
The Kurgans, who were so important to my ancestors
and those who came here before us,
haven't seen such a worthy group in a long time.
I welcome all of you.
Mr. Tomasz, an art historian.
The International Association of Historians,
the treasure hunters from Sweden,
and Anka Modzelewska, a brilliant journalist.
And finally,
the daughter of the legendary treasure hunter…
Karen Petersen.
You are here because you want to find the cross
that will lead you to the Templars' treasure.
The search shall be conducted by groups consisting of six people.
Should have asked Gierymska for five partners.
If you're not in a group, you'll be out.
Hello. I'm Eagle Eye, and I'd like to invite you to join our team.
I've got a lot of thoughts about the cross, which…
Three kids and a wannabe reporter?
No, thank you.
Time's running out!
Fine.
But you take my lead. And don't get in the way.
-Understood? -Of course.
I know that
you wanted to ask, but you don't have to.
-Yes, I'll join you. -But we don't know each other.
Are you one of those who only kiss on the third date?
-What game are you playing? -I like ping-pong.
-What game are you playing? -I like ping-pong. Your father dying wasn't enough?
I don't need a substitute.
I'm glad that most of you managed to team up.
The first clue.
May fate be on your side.
"Mr. Tomasz, the ruthless treasure hunter."
"Ruthless even to children." My next story.
We have something in common. They're not here with you either.
They were tired.
Yotvingian for "Your treasure's where the Yotvingian's heart is."
Where else could it be if not in a sacred place?
And the only sacred place here is this kurgan.
Laima is deceiving us. There's nothing here.
I'm not sure if one can trust you. My father did, and look what happened.
Petersen was my friend.
I hope I never become one.
No need to worry.
-What? -Nothing.
Forget it.
I won't be your bestie either.
What do you think about the stars?
I like Lennon. McCartney, not so much.
Individually, each one is perfect.
But together, they form wonderful constellations.
You won't convince me of your idea. I don't need partners.
And that's why you lack the perspective to see the obvious.
It's obvious that your recklessness and that reporter's stupidity
led Adiós here and, with him, death.
Do you want Petersen's daughter to die too?
-Are you feeling all right? -Yes, I'm fine.
But please hurry. I don't know how long I'll be able to keep helping you.
Helping me?
You are the reason evil might win.
And you're the good one, huh?
Because you always make choices that make the world a better place,
that make people happy, that save lives?
Sometimes evil has to prevail
so that the good can find out how to be good.
Good night, my friend.
Good night.
I can only count on you, buddy.
What's happened?
Adiós!
He was here!
There's nobody there. It was a bad dream.
I'm telling the truth!
Sleep.
Will you come back if he does?
Hey.
When I had nightmares, my uncle Gromiłło made me hot cocoa
When I had nightmares, my uncle Gromiłło made me hot cocoa and would add turmeric.
I'd drink it in one go and fall asleep.
Were you afraid to be alone too?
Or of the guys shouting
that nobody would ever want me because I'm a loser?
And of adults saying they'll be right back but disappear forever?
See? Works like a charm.
Drink up and get back inside.
Could I sleep out here?
I won't have bad dreams. Scout's honor.
Take a look. The de Molay cross.
I've been thinking it could be a signpost. After all, "N"--
Means north. But how does that fit with the rest of the letters?
X, L? Right.
Let's go to sleep.
Holy smokes. From this perspective, you have a perfect view of the stars.
Perspective.
What about the rest? We're one team.
A good treasure hunter must take matters into their own hands.
I don't have the perspective to see the obvious.
Excuse me?
The stones of the kurgan make the shape of a sun cross.
-The symbol of the goddess Saulė. -But what could that mean?
The Baltic goddess Saulė was a patron of orphans.
She was often portrayed dressed in gold and red,
dancing, or riding a white horse.
Hold on! The shield in Laima's tent had a picture of a white horse.
Very good!
Let's go.
Good work, my friends.
-Wanna get roughed up again? -A piece of advice, Señor Tomasz.
If you want to get rid of someone, do it so they can't come back.
Go. I'll deal with them.
Hey. Come here, boy. Don't be afraid.
Run, warn the others!
-And let Laima know. -Come here.
-I know where the cross is. -Yeah?
-Lead the way. -All right.
Anka!
Where's Eagle Eye?
I thought he was with you.
Oh no.
The boy! The boy is in there!
I wasn't able to get him out!
Eagle Eye!
Eagle Eye!
Eagle Eye!
I wanted to take matters into my own hands.
AMBULANCE
Is he your son?
We received information that some scouts--
Yes, he's our child. And the other two as well.
But…
-You don't look like-- -Why doesn't this man believe you, Mom?
Is he a misogynist?
In the future, please try to be a more responsible parent.
Of course. Tomek, give the kid your shirt.
What's going on?
There was a cross like de Molay's in the shield.
-Karen was here. -What's happened to her?
Adiós took the cross and kidnapped her.
Get dressed.
-You've lost something. -Well, we've got a problem, Mr. Tomasz.
I warned you.
You still think that you, alone, should find the treasure,
but you won't find it.
And until you make your peace with that, you won't be ready to search for it.
But it's good that you trusted the children. They're our strength.
What?
Adiós has the cross.
He's headed for the treasure.
We won't find it. It's over.
The cross had the full inscription!
What?
Will you take us with you?
Tell me!
"…ibi cor tuum."
And the letter "E" for east. Maybe it is a signpost after all?
"Ubi thesaurus tuus ibi cor tuum."
"Your treasure is where your heart is." But whose heart is this about?
There are two crosses.
Maybe de Molay wasn't alone but had a team?
Yes, de Molay found the treasure…
In the ruby--
That means the cross was a signpost for de Molay.
That's why the ruby had his name on it.
So, it's about his heart, but what could it be?
Maybe one of the Templars' seats of power? Jerusalem, Cyprus.
The cross was created during their downfall, but we're closer.
There was a different signature on the other cross. "Von Feuchtwagen."
And you're telling me this now? Von Feuchtwangen.
The Grand Master of the Teutonic Order. Incredible.
It means that the Grand Masters of the Teutonic Order and the Templars
were on a crusade together.
They discovered the treasure together.
Von Feuchtwangen moved the Teutonic capital
from Venice to Malbork to protect the treasure.
Malbork is the heart.
-Let's go, then. -No, stop!
Stop.
I'm not rescuing you again.
But we had a deal.
We helped you out. You promised!
No way I'm going back to the orphanage as a loser without the treasure!
There's no room for you here.
Ta-da!
Thanks, buddy.
-Since we're a team now-- -We're not a team.
That's your opinion.
Let's vote.
-You need a code name. -There are more important things.
I've got it! Mr. Big Ego.
Maybe Mr. Artifact or Mr. Stiff.
Mr. Tomasz is right.
Assuming Adiós left four hours before we did
and was speeding…
He was definitely speeding.
…we'd have to do 310 km/h to arrive in Malbork right after he does.
That's not gonna happen.
Hey, I was kidding!
Look at that. I'm not "Mr. Stiff" anymore?
I've got a code name! Mr. Car! No way.
I'll distract them, and you go inside.
They'll stay and wait for backup.
Snack up? Are we snacking?
Mentor! I'll figure something out.
What's up?
-Come here! -Let's go.
Quickly.
Stop squirming!
Karen. Stay here. I'll handle it myself.
-We're-- -Stay here!
Hey, stop!
-Did you hear something? -What? No.
The treasurer's chambers in the High Castle include the vault.
That's too easy. Mr. Tomasz said the inscription is the key.
"Your treasure is where your heart is." Whose?
-The Teutonic Knights'? The Templars'? -The castle's?
A place that's the heart of the castle.
They're coming.
Where's the treasure?
In the National Museum.
In a few days. Relax, I can get you an entry ticket.
You are a fool, Señor Tomasz.
You want to lock up something in a museum that has power over life and death?
Is there nobody you'd like to bring back to life?
Nobody?
Should I feel bad for you?
My boy did not deserve to die.
I need this treasure to get him back. Help me out.
You're insane.
You'll die in agony, señor.
Nobody will shed a tear for you. You're alone.
And your blind faith in all those trinkets has brought you here.
Why do you keep trying to save me?
Don't flatter yourself.
Feeling guilty?
Tell me where the treasure is, and I'll forgive you.
-I don't need your forgiveness. -We could help each other.
Your charms don't work on me.
First of all, they work on everyone.
Look.
-Leave me alone. -Look!
Look here!
Look at this.
We'll get the treasure together.
Come on.
-Damn. -Shi--
-Wait. -Higher.
Hold on a moment. Come on.
Raise your leg.
Come on…
What's that noise? Hey!
What's going on here?
It's not enough for you to kill us. You won't let us have a moment of intimacy before we die?
You won't let us have a moment of intimacy before we die?
Get out of here. Right now!
You little scum.
Nice going, beautiful!
Holy smokes!
The Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
To an order knight, the church is the heart of the castle.
You see?
We managed on our own.
So, where's the treasure?
The church consists of the vestibule, the transept, and the nave body.
So the heart must be in the nave.
If we assume that the nave is the body of the church,
the heart should be somewhere--
Somewhere… here!
What you've missed is that this isn't about a person's body.
If a church is the heart of the castle, what's the heart of the church?
The place of sacrifice.
-Meaning? -The altar. He's got it!
Originally, the altar used to be somewhere else.
Come on.
What you've missed
is that in von Feuchtwangen's time, they added a chancel in the eastern part.
Originally, the altar used to be somewhere else.
Meaning here!
Here.
An inscription.
-Maybe it's a clue? -It's not an inscription.
It's a number. 1212.
Laima wanted to meet at 12:12. Maybe it's a date?
Year 1212.
The Children's Crusade! They recruited pure-hearted orphans.
Saulė is the patron of orphans. What does it mean?
Hey…
Well done, Squirrel.
Oh. Excuse me.
Come on.
It's some kind of workshop.
-There were six crosses. -The number of people in Laima's groups.
Six men went on a secret mission to the Holy Land.
They found a treasure of enormous power.
They divided it into six parts to shield it from the evil of this world.
That secret was buried in a vault, and each cross was a signpost to it.
And we must be in the chamber of the vault's constructor.
But the evil turned up to be in their midst.
Philip used his share of the treasure to murder and destroy.
He couldn't decipher the inscription on the cross,
so he decided to find out what the others knew and killed them.
Philip the Fair came to the Holy Land with de Molay and Feuchtwangen.
He belonged to the Knights of the Tau. History does not tell this story.
So Adiós wants to finish what Philip the Fair started.
Start a war.
And sow destruction.
No, nobody is sowing anything because the treasure isn't here.
But Adiós will be here soon. Let's go.
Quickly, let's go.
Hurry up.
Careful.
The party's over. There's no treasure.
Only Philip the Fair is turning in his grave.
Try to open the door. Anka, help the kids. Karen and I will distract them.
-Why me again? -Because you're a known coward.
Yes. Help the kids with the door.
Maybe you'll have better luck, sister.
-It won't! -Got an idea.
Tomek, give it up. Go help the kids. Right now!
Anka was having trouble here, so I thought I'd help.
There! See? Worked like a charm. Quickly.
The treasure will help us bring them--
-Why so long? -I had to clean up your mess.
-Get in! -Quick!
The cross.
-What? -Everything goes to the museum.
-Karen! -What?
-Come on. -They always come after everything's done.
-The kidnapped kids! -What?
Get them!
-Get out! -What is it?
-Get down! -What is this about?
Why are you struggling?
-Easy! -What is it?
-Treat a lady with respect! -Hands!
-Gentlemen! -No talking!
Hey! Leave it!
-Leave it! -You're coming with us.
-Stop struggling. -God!
-Jeez, calm down. -Hands off me!
THREE KIDNAPPED SCOUTS BLACK VOLGA SNATCHING OR HUMAN WICKEDNESS?
"We're a team."
"Let's pick code names. We're in this together."
If you knew, you wouldn't have agreed.
Exactly. They wouldn't have gotten in the way.
-Married? -Absolutely not!
Are you sure?
For a moment, I thought I was too hard on you in my articles.
But you are a narcissist basking in the glow of relics.
I wish I hadn't teamed up. The treasure would be mine by now.
"Mine"! Does everything need to be yours? Why can't you get along with people?
Because you want to be close when things are going well.
And in the end, you lie to me anyway.
Just like me.
Always wearing my heart on my sleeve.
But people show no respect.
Eagle Eye adores you. He'd do anything for you.
The kids all grew to like you. I like you, too, damn it!
That's why you lied? Maybe we were afraid of rejection?
Look what that boy did for you. And you keep testing him.
But you forgive Karen for everything.
Because her father saved my life.
And I couldn't save his.
The kids confirmed your story.
The parents are coming.
For two of them. The third one is someone from an orphanage.
You are free.
Ms. Anka! Mr. Tomasz!
Is everything sorted out? Can we go?
I'm going. I don't care what you all do.
But I thought we were a team.
We never were, and we never will be a team!
The treasure may be in the wrong hands because of your lies.
We wanted to tell you. There was so much going on that we wanted to help.
But you only got in the way.
Mr. Car! That's actually a good name for you.
That is all you care about.
You care more about things than other people.
No one else matters! It's just you and the car!
And that has always served me well.
And remember that, boy, before you start trusting other guys.
And girls.
In the end, people will always choose what's best for them, not for you.
Parents, articles or-- -Treasure. -Treasure.
-Treasure. -Treasure.
I don't want to go back to the orphanage as a loser.
-I've heard you never give up. -You know something about that?
You know why I missed the Olympics?
Because I was afraid that I'd let everybody down.
I chickened out.
Sound familiar?
Excuse me.
Here.
So that nobody bothers you there.
-I thought you left us too. -No. This time I'm not giving up.
You're not going back to the orphanage without treasure. Come.
Hup!
What have I missed?
But where is the treasure? The cross.
-The cross is a signpost. -Let's go.
What's going on?
So, where is this treasure, mis compañeros?
I'm sorry I let you down.
And not just you.
Too bad you can't talk.
You could lift my spirits.
This? This is supposed to cheer me up?
Of course.
What happened to you?
And you?
Long story.
Ours is short. Adiós kidnapped Eagle Eye.
He knows where the treasure is but needs a cross.
I was stupid, and Eagle Eye was right.
The cross is a signpost.
The "N" on the top means "north." The "E," "east."
The other characters were unclear. They're not letters. They're numbers.
"L" is 50, and "X" is 10. So it's 50N, 10E.
It's impossible. These have to be those coordinates.
And they are! In those days, Greenwich was not the reference point.
The Ferro point on El Hierro Island.
Before Columbus' discoveries,
that was the westernmost point of land known to Europeans.
So the treasure is
here.
We are going.
"We"?
Well, since we already have code names, it would be a shame if they went to waste.
POLICE
Look for letters like the ones on the cross.
Just be careful.
It's odd, Señor Tomasz, but this boy really likes you.
You don't even see it, and yet he's still loyal to you.
From the start, I felt there was something exceptional about him.
But he doesn't like me as much as you.
He said he'd do anything to help you get the treasure.
I'll make his dream come true.
Why do you help your father's murderer?
You killed him.
-You believe him? -He's willing to share the treasure.
-You want it for yourself. -The museum.
He wants it to kill and destroy. The treasure could resurrect my father.
Let him go. I'll find that damn treasure for you.
"L." We're going down.
Go ahead, my friends.
Quickly.
Señor Tomasz, don't do anything stupid.
You can come down!
Good job, my boy.
You do not appreciate what you have.
Pity.
Now you won't get the chance.
No!
Tomek!
Hey.
You said you wouldn't hurt the kid. Relax, señorita. You can resurrect him
just like your charred father.
I'm coming to you, my son.
I'm coming.
Goodbye, my friends.
Mr. Tomasz.
-Are you okay? -Hey.
Please get up.
Your treasure is where your heart is.
Let's go. This place is full of traps.
No! The treasure is so close.
Didn't you see what happened to Adiós?
But he was acting alone, and the vault was built by a team.
Look. Some plates have symbols
of the knights who discovered the treasure.
Those plates must activate some mechanism.
-I've found the Templar cross. -Tau Cross.
Egyptian cross. Everyone, stand on one of the plates.
Let's try doing it together. Now.
The last plate must be under the sphere. We're missing one person.
Who do I stand in for?
-I'll go. -No.
It's too dangerous.
I know, but I've got you.
Is that it?
Quickly, there!
Eagle Eye! Come back!
-Incredible. -Hey.
The treasure is children.
Squirrel!
Hold this!
Grab my hand!
Run!
No!
Hold on!
-Karen! -Karen!
Karen!
Where's Karen?
I don't know. She disappeared.
What are you doing here?
I need what you have found.
The treasure was the children who survived the Crusades.
I was right to respect your intellect.
What happened to them?
There were six children with great power.
The order knights decided
that each of them would take one of the children to a safe place.
But Philip the Fair deceived them
and used his child to do evil things.
And the scroll?
They only revealed the hiding place of the children to their confessor,
who wrote it down on the scroll, which he then hid.
He built the vault and gave the crosses to the knights.
But after so many years,
does this scroll have any value?
It can help find the descendants of those children.
Some of them have great power.
Thanks to you all, nobody will find out where they are.
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
I'm begging you.
I wasn't the one who found the treasure. It was Eagle Eye.
You need to ask him.
What does your heart tell you, Eagle Eye?
Here you go.
Thank you.
There is great power within you.
Don't let it fade away.
I'm glad that fate guided you the way it did.
What's your connection to all of this?
I've already told you.
A personal one.
NATIONAL MUSEUM
Why do we love treasure so much?
Because it's incredible? Precious? Beautiful?
But maybe it's not owning it that is interesting.
Maybe it's the quest?
What's most important is to know what or who is our true treasure.
A very good article.
Must be the first one to your liking.
Must be the first well-written one.
Or maybe you've changed?
Kids!
Hey!
Holy smokes! This article is amazing! Kids at the orphanage say hello to me now.
-They pass me the ketchup. -Wow!
Excuse me for a moment.
-Nice to see you. How are you? -Great.
-Good. You finally like him! -It took me a while.
We cleared the rubble from the vault.
We haven't found Karen's body.
Adiós and his people? The vault? The Knights of Tau?
They all just vanished. I'm asking around. Nobody knows anything.
I won't rest until I solve it.
For now, I've got something else for you.
Someone in Bieszczady is stealing old priceless icons
and taking them abroad.
Looks like the thieves have very specific taste.
The icons are said to contain clues leading to "the mystery of mysteries."
Can you handle it?
Tomek?
Alone? I don't know.
But with a team? Definitely.
I'm not "Tomek."
Please call me "Mr. Car."
Excuse me. We've managed to save the burned painting.
a sea monster from Greek mythology.
Out of nowhere, its beautiful voice comes and reaches the ships sailing the ocean.
Captivated by its voice,
the sailors lose their way and sink to the bottom of the ocean.
Everyone who comes across a Siren is destined to meet their death.
Because love brings you closer to death.
That's not a story for a sea trip.
Starbucks' logo.
That is a Siren.
I only drink Doutor Coffee.
I was told that the captain is strict.
He was fired last month for workplace bullying.
The new captain is…
Please.
Okay.
The show is called "Nine Methods of Brilliant Women."
Great to have you.
My pleasure.
-What? The reality show? -Let's begin.
She'll be in it?
So, what is your first method?
I make it a rule never to hold back
because that's my, my way.
"My, my way"?
Holding back hinders your growth.
-I'm getting nervous. -To enrich your life and become creative, each of us has to…
and become creative, each of us has to…
Mr. Ubukata.
Mr. Ubukata. A customer's causing trouble again.
I understand.
He's over there.
What's going on? I need to make a call.
So, Mr. Ubukata is a butler you can rely on.
It's not like that. It's because…
he's an excellent lightning rod.
We are very sorry.
On your knees.
We sincerely apologize.
-Don't move. Stay down there. -Yes, sir.
Wow, I got signals.
-Don't you move, you hear? -Yes, sir.
MOM
Oh, hello, Mom.
Well, well.
Guess where I am.
Don't you get disheartened?
Mr. Ubukata, don't you have pride?
Pride?
He's just fine.
He doesn't need to worry about pride.
Don't put strange ideas into my lightning rod's head.
There's a price for the peace and security on the ship.
Please.
It's cold.
We are very sorry.
What's the temperature?
It feels like 13 degrees Celsius in here.
We are very sorry--
My apologies!
I'm so very sorry.
I can't eat it anymore!
Kanato.
Can you carry this?
Certainly, Miss.
My sincerest apologies.
Welcome.
I'm Edward.
I'm real.
The waiting room is this way.
She's from the Kuruma family.
The Kuruma family?
A family member of the director of the Kyuho Association, the medical corporation.
A doctor?
You don't know him?
Dr. Sohei Kuruma, the godfather of medical circles?
His son is the head of Kuruma General Hospital,
and that's his wife.
Make sure you treat them well.
Yes, sir.
-It's delicious, isn't it? -It's great.
-Bonsoir. -Bonsoir.
Welcome to the party.
Wow!
Would you pick a card?
Okay.
-Don't show it to me. -Okay.
Memorize the card.
May I have it?
Time for…
Edward's magic.
-Oh! This is amazing! -That's the card you picked!
-Wow! -Amazing!
Please enjoy your evening.
What is the matter, sir?
You're older than me.
Why do you speak to me like that? I'm just a kid.
I have the honor of serving as a butler on this ship.
Have the honor?
Did I make you a butler?
I'm sorry, sir--
My mom's a housekeeper.
I'm here to take care of the daughter of the family.
So, I'm not really a guest.
Everyone with a ticket is our guest here.
Everyone around you is so selfish.
Are you really happy living like this?
Sir, with all due respect--
Stop being so polite. It feels like you don't care at all.
Okay then.
That's better.
You know, I've got someone who lets me be me.
Look.
Do you know her?
She's a weatherperson.
She'll come on board tomorrow at the Port of Yokohama.
To tell you the truth,
we're getting married as soon as this voyage is done.
I know, yes, it's fantastic…
I just wish…
this ship would sink.
Sir?
Checkmate.
You beat me.
You are so good at it, Miss.
You're such a poor player, Kanato.
Let's play again.
Sure.
Throughout my whole life, I have been devoted to you, Father.
But how come my name is not in your will?
-Mrs. Sakumoto. -Yes, sir.
You're seducing him.
You're letting this woman seduce you.
Hey. At least let me see your will.
When I'm gone,
all my wealth will go to you, Mrs. Sakumoto.
But what about your son?
You know… I want to go to heaven.
WAKABA: SORRY. I GOT AN URGENT JOB. I WON'T BE ABLE TO COME.
This is Wakaba Funabashi.
Please leave a message.
Hello, it's me.
I got your message.
Well, it's okay.
Work is work. Can't help it, right?
I guess I'll see you in 45 days--
Ouch!
May I have your attention please.
You may now board the ship.
It's okay. Just do it. Yes. Right. Do it.
This is great! Just like Ibiza!
Oh, look! That's just like Ibiza!
-Awesome! -Isn't this so cool?
-So cool! -Gorgeous!
What's going on?
I can't believe there are all these banal people here!
Wait! No!
One guest has not checked in yet.
"Ms. Chizuru Banjaku."
I understand.
Ma'am?
Ma'am, could you check in, please?
Excuse me?
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.
-Ma'am? -Well, I'm…
-Pardon me. -I'm not a guest.
Sorry.
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
I believe this person is on this ship.
Miss Wakaba Funabashi. Where's her room?
Ma'am.
Please wait.
-Ma'am. -Yes, sorry. Excuse me.
Please pardon me, ma'am.
Are you an acquaintance of Ms. Wakaba Funabashi?
Not exactly.
Mr. Ubukata?
Yes, I'm Ubukata, the butler.
You're Wakaba Funabashi's boyfriend.
-What? -You are, right?
Where is Wakaba Funabashi's room?
She's not on board.
She could not make it because of her work.
If I may ask…
They got me.
Excuse me?
I'll get off.
I've got to get off. I'm getting off!
-Ma'am? -I've got to go.
I'm getting off. Let me get off.
We are about to leave port.
Mr. Butler. -Yes? -Do you realize
-Yes? -Do you realize why your girlfriend is not on board this ship right now?
-Her work's giving her trouble. -No.
Your girlfriend is with another man right now.
She's betraying you to be with someone else. Are you going to let her be?
Excuse me, but do you have any proof?
She's having an affair with my boyfriend.
We're being cheated on.
We must stop them.
Ma'am?
Ma'am! Excuse me.
Please, ma'am!
This way.
Would you like some?
Enjoy.
Any drinks?
Thank you for waiting.
Here you go.
Please enjoy your time here.
Time for…
Edward's magic!
Welcome to the party!
Yes.
A humidifier?
Thank you for waiting.
If I may.
Please excuse me.
Did you get in touch with your weather girl?
I'm afraid I cannot answer personal questions.
If you would excuse me.
May I ask a question?
Why do you have such suspicions?
What is that?
My boyfriend and your girlfriend have been exchanging messages.
I found out his account and password.
They don't know that I know.
So I can read what they're saying to each other.
That's called intercepting--
He's my boyfriend.
Peeking into your partner's phone is the one thing you should never do--
It's an emergency.
"When you gaze into the abyss, the abyss does the same to you."
Perhaps, it may be my duty to verify whether your claim is true.
Do you want to take a look?
Just to verify. For five seconds.
Press and hold it so it won't be marked as read.
Thank you.
They are seeing each other. They are, right?
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
WELL, I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND TOO.
It's been more than five seconds.
I have a boyfriend.
Well, I have a girlfriend too.
Maybe I shouldn't see you anymore.
Just seeing each other
shouldn't be that bad.
Don't suddenly hold my hand like that.
Sorry.
Don't apologize.
No, I mean… I'm sorry I got you into trouble.
I really am.
I'm fine.
So, don't apologize.
How much did you read?
As far as "Don't apologize."
-And after that? -This is enough.
It gets more interesting after that.
"Interesting"?
What do you mean?
Didn't you get enough?
There's no need to head down to the basement when you know for sure there's a ghost.
A hot spring?
Somewhere like Hakone.
A hot spring, huh?
I'd love that.
I'd love to go.
What are they talking about?
Probably planning a trip to Hakone.
-A day trip? -No way!
This is Wakaba Funabashi. Please leave a--
She's not going to answer.
Because he's not picking up my calls.
That can't be!
Wait. Is this a prank?
Did she ask you to film this for our wedding ceremony?
You can deny it all you want.
But if you keep denying it, they're going to the hot spring.
Yes, but…
Let's go back to Japan right away and stop them.
We've already left port.
Are you going to just let them be?
They are cheating on us.
They're going to take a bath together.
They're going to sleep in the same room!
If you would excuse me.
I deeply apologize.
I'm afraid that we won't be returning to Japan for another 42 days.
Can't we just tell them something came up so we have to turn back real quick?
With 4,860 guests on board, it's impossible to turn back real quick.
Once a ship departs,
it can never turn back.
By the time we get back,
they may be already married.
Ma'am?
Ma'am! Ma'am!
Ma'am.
Ma'am. Excuse me.
Pardon me. Sorry.
Ma'am!
Ma'am, where are you going?
I'm going to ask the captain.
Where is the captain?
Ma'am.
Please, ma'am.
Can you fetch Mrs. Sakumoto?
You don't need that servant.
Let's have a chat with me.
Please wait.
Ma'am!
-Ma'am. -Excuse me!
Hey. Yes, you.
Yes, ma'am?
Do you work here?
Yes. Can I be of service to you?
Be of service to me?
Wait, really? Can't you tell? Aren't you quick enough to see this disaster happening around here?
Aren't you quick enough to see this disaster happening around here?
People must call you dull all the time.
Tell him my favorite phrase.
"All reserved."
That's what I like. All reserved.
All reserved. Wrap party. Avex. But now?
-We're sharing the table. -Sharing.
What does this mean? Know what I'm saying?
I'm really sorry, but we are very busy right now.
Isn't that your problem?
I don't think that's my problem. What do you think?
It's their problem.
I'm truly sorry.
You don't need to apologize.
Just let us have this table all to ourselves. Right now.
What? You go somewhere else.
We were here first.
I'll tell you what.
You only worry about who's first when you line up to eat ramen.
You guys have never been to Europe, right?
It's all about your social standing, not your order of arrival.
I was 18 when I first went to Velfarre.
Since then, the Avex people have always let me skip the line.
What's Velfarre?
What's Avex?
Velfarre is Velfarre, just like Avex is Avex.
I call it the unbearable lightness of being.
I don't know what they're saying, but I think they're being rude.
Hey, you.
Get rid of Mr. Banal and his friend right now.
Are you calling us banal?
I wasn't that rude.
I said "Mr." Banal.
Or should I say, like the French, Monsieur Banal?
Move them already!
I'm sorry but--
You're no good. Call the captain.
-I apologize. -We are the guests.
Excuse me.
Maybe you should try to be a little more polite.
Why do we have to worry about that? We are the guests.
Because you're the guests.
You know the most foolish kind of people in the world?
People who are rude to service workers.
Let's go, Mr. Butler.
What? Ma'am?
Excuse me.
Well, I'm not foolish.
Wow, amazing!
Oh my, you're amazing!
Wow. Thank you.
Welcome to the party.
You know how happy Rena is to be able to travel with you.
Rena loves her grandfather.
I don't have a grandchild.
What are you talking about?
Rena is your granddaughter.
I know she isn't.
She is your love child.
The fruit of your adultery.
That ship. Isn't it inbound?
You can't switch ships like you switch trains.
You are so calm, Mr. Butler.
We have 4,860 guests to take care of
so they can enjoy a pleasant voyage.
The guests are more important than your lover?
Of course.
Wait, doesn't it look like he's going to jump?
I beg your pardon?
Don't you think?
People ever told you you're dull?
Someone just did.
We'd better stop him.
Kanato.
Kanato?
It's you. Good evening.
-Goodbye. -Good evening.
Goodbye.
You need to have a star in your heart.
If you follow the star, you'll get to your destination.
That is my nine method--
Captain.
There is an illegal fishing boat on our course.
Go around it.
Great shot!
Let's see.
How many years ago was it?
Someone came to us on a referral from the Minister.
She needed an organ transplant.
I found the perfect candidate.
A newlywed.
Her husband was there to see her.
I told them
that I'd be performing her operation.
They were so happy they cried.
The following day,
the husband brought me apples his parents grew.
The operation was successful.
For the person who needed the organ, that is.
But as for the husband who lost his wife…
I don't think he ever knew
what was missing from her body.
You can't take your money to the afterworld.
So I wonder sometimes.
Perhaps if I had eaten those apples back then,
would everything have been better?
But that doesn't mean you should give your wealth to a servant.
Mrs. Sakumoto reminds me of my first love.
She's got a pure heart.
I knew it. She's been seducing you.
Not everybody chooses to live the same way you do.
Take your daughter and leave.
I'm giving my money to Mrs. Sakumoto,
and I'm going to see my first love.
I'm going to heaven.
Oh no! I'm so sorry!
What should I do? Hang on!
I'm so sorry!
No!
You're scaring me.
How dare you!
Why are you following me?
Were you drawing the ocean?
You can't see anything at night.
Want one?
Don't treat me like a kid.
I don't want candies.
Hold on. Later, later.
Wait.
The elevator is here.
-Which floor will you be going to? -The 16th floor.
-Hey, I got lipstick on me. -Hold it.
What?
Get off.
You get off.
You got in later.
Have you been to Europe?
Doesn't matter who was first.
I'll get off.
Wait, wait. Don't move.
Stay still. Just stay still.
This is why I hate sharing!
-Wow! -Gorgeous!
Just like the calendar!
Looks like Ibiza. Just like Ibiza.
-You ready? -Go ahead.
Oh, wait.
Hey.
-You guys are in the way. -Hurry.
Do I look good?
-Yeah, it'll do. -What about my hair?
Did you hear that?
A Siren…
I'm sure it's just staged.
Of course, it is. Don't make a fuss.
-Jeez. -Excuse me for a moment.
Let's go take a look.
Who's that?
N-No way!
It's all right. Come here.
It's all right.
Hey, hey.
That was a murder, right?
-Someone was murdered, right? -No shit!
Oh my god!
Then, what about the party?
Why now?
If he dies now, his lawyer is going to reveal his will.
If you want to kill someone, you have to do it at the right time.
What is the secret to your everlasting beauty, Captain?
Beautiful work makes me beautiful.
That is my nine--
Excuse me, Captain. We have trouble with a customer.
Don't get in front of me.
They can't see my face.
I'm very sorry.
Over there.
Where? Where is it?
Where is the body?
It was here.
I'm telling the truth. I saw it.
Not just me.
There were… including me…
seven witnesses.
Were you all at the poolside?
Yes, we were.
-Weren't we? -Yeah.
We were.
Anything happened?
Did you see anything unusual?
Did we see anything?
Anything?
Like a dolphin?
What? There are dolphins? I wanted to see them.
Yeah, me too.
I see.
Did something happen?
Wait, you all saw it, didn't you?
Someone cried out.
Then another person was screaming as they hurried off,
and an elderly man fell into the pool.
Did you see that?
Of course not.
Are you talking about a movie?
There's a big monitor there.
No, not a movie. It was a real murder scene.
And you all saw it.
-How is it? -What?
You drowned him in the pool, right?
He didn't swallow too much water.
You sure he didn't throw it all up?
Why did you turn down the air conditioner's temperature so low?
Until we find his will,
we have to prevent the body from decaying.
We saw it!
-Mr. Ubukata. -Why does no one remember?
Stop it!
These are our guests.
I'm sorry.
No, we are sorry.
I wish we could be more helpful.
But we have no idea what you're talking about, right?
Right. No idea. Absolutely.
I don't have a clue.
You saw it, right?
Didn't you?
-At the pool-- -We didn't see anything.
We didn't, right?
Please accept our apologies.
My apologies for visiting at such a late hour.
We are all here.
Father, you already told me that story.
Oh, good evening.
Good evening, sir.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
I hope you have a good night.
Good night.
Father is still alive.
In fact, I respect you more now, Father.
Dad.
The Aegean Cruise will go on, right?
-Of course. -I see.
So nothing happened.
Can we make sure everyone's safe one more time?
There are more than 4,000 of them.
And you want to check if each one's alive?
The body might have been dumped into the sea.
You disappoint me.
I thought you were an excellent lightning rod.
I'll put you on suspension for a while.
Excuse me.
I saw it.
Not just me.
Everyone there saw the murder scene.
Then why didn't you say that?
Because the boy was in shock.
I should have been more thoughtful.
But what about the other guests?
You know why.
A murder would ruin the cruise they are enjoying so much.
What?
They chose the Aegean Cruise over a total stranger's life.
They may be even thinking,
They may be even thinking, "Why die now? Read the situation!"
A person died.
How could anyone ignore that and go on with the cruise?
Humans are free to think of anything they want in their hearts.
But then again, we can't just let it go, can we?
No, we can't.
Someone's life was taken.
We can't pretend that it didn't happen.
We should do something.
Yes, we should.
But what?
Why don't we try to persuade them?
What do you mean?
We'll talk to those four witnesses
and persuade them to tell the truth.
I see.
Well, I guess we can start there.
Yes.
Wait a minute.
What is your intention?
My intention?
Are you doing this for the deceased?
Or because you want to go back to Japan to stop your boyfriend?
For the deceased, of course.
Has anyone told you that you're a bad liar?
You've got a selfish motive…
Do you think a pure motive can solve the problem?
What are these?
Photos of pretty scenery they saw today?
Photos you'd send to your new sweetheart.
Yes, photos of pretty scenery they saw today.
Two shadows.
Another typical photo that a fresh couple would take.
I guess it's all over.
I got dumped.
There's no chance. Zero possibility of getting back together.
I should give up for my own good.
Hey, are you all right?
I'm very sorry.
I appreciate it.
Ma'am?
The water really feels cold at night.
Why did you become a butler?
Since I was in elementary school,
I've always loved working behind the scenes in parties and school festivals.
Don't you want to have fun yourself?
To have a party, you need someone to make preparations.
In case people get drunk, you need someone to take care of them.
Like side characters in romantic movies.
Sometimes they get in the way.
Ex-boyfriends and ex-girlfriends, for example.
Still, without the side characters,
the main characters' romance won't get exciting.
But what about the side characters' romance?
Can't be helped.
When the main characters succeed in love,
are the side characters supposed to just accept it
and simply withdraw?
When it comes to love, you can never be that understanding.
You don't want to be a butler in romance?
No.
We can all become the main characters in our own romance.
You're very persuasive, ma'am.
Okay.
Let's talk to those four guests.
We'll go back to Japan and make a comeback as main characters.
Shall we go get 'em?
Yes, let's go get 'em.
I'm beginning to enjoy this.
-Mr. Butler. -Yes?
This is a murder scene.
Which would you like, Meat or fish?
-Maybe I'll go with fish. -Fish, huh?
I knew you'd want that.
Those two.
I'm on suspension.
No one will recognize you now.
I'm not too sure about that.
Excuse me, sir.
I think you dropped this.
Oh, I'm very so…
I mean, thanks.
Wait, I'll use the washroom first. I'll be waiting.
Very fishy.
Why are you following me?
Did the group send you? Was it the boss?
Ouch, that hurt!
What?
You are…
Are you okay?
Excuse me, who did you mean by "boss"?
Shut up.
That's none of your business.
Do you want to get chopped up by the screw propeller…
Or be eaten by sharks? I'll let you choose.
Stop it, Ryuki.
Miss Shiori.
My father is a yakuza boss.
We can stop pretending.
It's better to seek their assistance than be wrongly suspected.
You see…
I am a daughter of what you might want to call… an antisocial criminal.
Seijuro Hagiwara. That's the head of the Hagiwara Group, and my father.
This guy here is an ex-member of our group.
-Ex? -My father wouldn't let us marry.
So we grabbed some money from the group and eloped.
It's all because of my incompetence.
Don't say that.
I'm happy to be here.
Miss Shiori.
So you can't go back to Japan.
That's why you kept silent about the murder.
We'll get killed if we go back.
Is a dead guy more important to you than living people?
We can talk to the police.
We are still yakuza. We don't want the police's help.
I'll talk to them.
-I'll kill you. -Ryuki.
You can't scare me with that.
All right.
You asked for it.
-Sir, please! -Ryuki.
I have to protect her. So I'm going to get rid of you.
Stop it, Ryuki.
Ma'am! Sir, please! Ma'am!
Go ahead. I'm not going to give in to threats.
Sir!
Please stop!
We'll never disclose your secret. I promise.
Why?
Protecting the privacy of our guests is my duty as a butler.
Please step away from her.
I can't tell if this is good or bad.
Of course, that movie wasn't bad.
But I want to be in a better one.
I want to be in a better movie.
What do you mean, a better movie?
There are only two kinds of movies, those that sell and those that don't.
I want to be in a movie that will take me to Cannes.
What's Cannes?
The film festival. They give out awards.
They screen a bunch of movies.
You can screen yours at Toho Cinemas.
No!
People dress up in tuxedoes.
The entire town of Cannes is involved.
A local matchmaking meetup?
I'll admit.
The movies you produce make money.
But still, you make really bad movie adaptations out of really great manga series.
You always get flamed for that.
In short, Cannes movies make money,
In short, Cannes movies make money, but they earn it from rich people instead of the commoners.
I guess.
I am Aina Horikawa.
Just do as I say, and you'll get famous. All right?
You know I trust you.
Excuse me.
Bring me a menu.
Over here!
Hurry up!
AINA HORIKAWA
Too slow!
AINA HORIKAWA'S MARRIAGE PRESS MEET
She's married to someone else.
I've been in her movie.
What?
I've been in one of the movies you produced.
What? Are you an actress?
The only audition I ever passed was for your movie.
Then I should deserve some gratitude.
What role?
The girl whose butt gets stuck between the elevator doors.
Oh, I think I remember.
The butt girl, yes. And why are you here?
Pardon me, ma'am.
This may sound rather rude,
but are you two in a so-called adulterous relationship?
That really is rude of you!
I'm very sorry.
If this murder causes a stir,
your adultery will be exposed.
People will find out how vile you both are.
So, you insisted you saw nothing. Do I understand correctly?
I'm afraid you can't smoke here.
I didn't light it. Stop annoying me.
A man died. So what?
Why do we have to cancel our voyage?
I'm not doing anything wrong.
Do you know why?
We are the guests!
I'm very sorry.
Do not apologize, Mr. Butler.
Money can't buy other people's hearts.
Miss Butt Girl.
What?
Do you hate me?
Don't worry. Most people hate me.
They say I'm bossy, I look down on people, I rely on the power of money.
Maybe they're right.
But I'll tell you what.
You're fighting against the wrong people.
You think you hate rich people.
But that's not true.
It's you, you, you, and you. You who don't have any confidence in yourself.
You think the poor are always right and the rich are always bad?
Is that really true?
Do you know why I'm rich?
Because I work hard.
I got Richard Mille, Patek Philippe, Birkin, and the Centurion card.
I got them all on my own.
I'm not going to apologize for that.
With climate change and food shortages,
people will start eating crickets.
But I'm going to keep eating meat.
Because I worked hard to deserve it.
But you didn't.
People who blame others for their own failures
can only get to be a butt person.
And they'll end up eating crickets. Do you understand?
No, I don't.
I don't care.
And you too.
If you are a servant, work like a responsible servant.
Take the butt girl and get out of here right now.
No, we won't!
-Very well. -What?
My apologies.
All right. All banal people, out!
Don't get your butt caught in the door.
Ma'am.
Please excuse us.
You can leave it there.
No, I'll wash it.
You probably can't tell, but I used to work at the cleaners.
You've done all kinds of things.
Yes, I have.
There were lots of things I wanted to do,
but I couldn't find a job that suited me, unlike you.
I'm not complaining.
Not having a suitable job doesn't mean you can't enjoy your life.
I'm beginning to doubt if I'm really cut out for my job.
He's a good guy.
But good guys are boring.
I know.
They are boring because they are not enjoying life.
People who don't enjoy life don't give you excitement when you're with them.
My girlfriend is like that too.
She's so serious.
She's not feminine at all.
My boyfriend isn't masculine too.
I see.
She's right.
I am a boring person.
But not you, ma'am.
He doesn't think I'm feminine.
He's wrong about that.
I think you are very feminine.
Sorry, I didn't mean that.
Let me take that back.
By taking it back, I mean I shouldn't have said that I found you feminine.
But generally and objectively speaking,
I believe there is no denying that you are very feminine.
Sorry.
I am enjoying life in my own way.
Me too.
I enjoy life in my own way.
We are on this beautiful ship too.
Exactly.
Ma'am, we have so much more to offer on this ship.
If you allow me to show you around.
Really?
Give me a few minutes.
I'll go change.
Oh, hold on.
What about…
I was in such a hurry.
I'm always like this.
Are you? Definitely not the first time.
Really?
I actually like it.
Yeah, I think it's very classy. Bonsoir.
Welcome to the party.
Oops. Sorry, sorry.
It's all right.
Apologies.
Would you like to pick a card?
Don't show it to me.
Please memorize it.
-Okay. -Okay
Over here, please.
Time for…
Edward's magic.
Time for…
Edward's magic.
Is this your card?
It is.
Please enjoy your evening.
I'm sorry.
I really had fun.
Mr. Butler, you are a nice person.
Are you making fun of me?
I think they are wrong.
Nice people are not just nice.
What?
Nice people were not born that way.
Instead, they make the effort to do so.
They try not to be rude,
and they try to be caring.
It's just that
selfish people seem more attractive.
But that's not right.
Nice people shouldn't be underestimated.
I think you're nice too, ma'am.
No, I'm not.
In my mind, I have all kinds of mean thoughts.
Like wishing they would have an accident on their way to the hot spring.
See? I'm terrible.
You have every right to think that way.
I want to get back at them too.
We do, don't we?
-I think we should. -How?
Any ideas?
No, wait.
That reminds me. We still have one more witness.
The last one.
Find the will as soon as possible.
If we don't hurry, the body's going to start to rot!
And my body is so dry.
I'm counting on you.
Don't talk about the body rotting when I'm eating. Okay, darling?
Okay, darling?
One more day might be all we could manage.
Yes?
I brought you some ice.
-Excuse me. -Hey!
Is he dead?
No, he's alive.
He just had breakfast.
Right, Father?
You liked the eggs Benedict, didn't you?
Here you go.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
You know I'm busy.
I can't leave Master like that.
You're tired.
So you slipped, didn't you?
Tell me. Are you hiding something?
Are you all right?
Are you okay?
That's what's important.
I'm prepared to take full responsibility
if something should happen to our guests--
A guest fell from the stairs and got injured.
Her breathing is stable,
but she suffered a concussion and is currently unconscious.
The air ambulance will arrive in half an hour.
Take the boy to his room.
Shouldn't he be with his mother?
Mr. Kuruma seems to think that his daughter needs her companion.
I'd like to apologize
for the trouble my mother has caused you.
Your mother is so clumsy.
Rena is bored.
Yes, ma'am. I'll be with her right away.
Since that night, nobody has seen Mr. Sohei Kuruma.
They haven't let the cleaning staff in for the last two days.
You have the master key?
Entering a guest's room without consent is prohibited.
Pardon me.
The room is too cold.
It feels like about 13 degrees Celsius.
I guess we were wrong.
I thought we were right on the mark.
Two shadows.
Do you want to get back at them?
We can send them a photo.
Oh, maybe here.
-Here? -Yes.
A bit closer.
Okay.
All right.
Here we go.
I'm a little nervous.
It's just our shadows.
Yes, shadows.
Don't you think…
Yes, it's a bit…
Their photo looked much better.
-They beat us. -Yeah.
How about we try…
Like this?
Did it just…
…look like we were kissing?
Right?
-Took me by surprise. -Yeah. Me too.
That might be better, do you think?
I think it's more effective.
Okay, then.
-I'll send it. -Okay.
Looks good.
This will fool them for sure.
Hello, it's me.
Oh, that's fantastic!
You found it!
I know, I know. You'll be rewarded sufficiently.
So go ahead and change the will.
Hurray! We did it!
Yes!
It's definitive proof.
I'll tell the captain.
When you think the worst has happened, an even worse thing happens. That's how life goes.
What am I saying?
-Captain. -Get out of my way.
Mr. Sohei Kuruma has passed away.
He said he'd lie down for a while,
and he never came back.
So I came in to check.
He had a heart problem.
So I'm guessing it was a cardiac infarction.
I'm the one who'll issue a death certificate.
It's my father's death certificate.
Don't you think that's my job?
Our condolences.
NEW MESSAGE FROM UBUKATA
MAY I COME OVER TO YOUR ROOM NOW?
INCOMING CALL RYO KIYOKAWA
INCOMING CALL RYO KIYOKAWA
Hello.
Oh, it's me.
Yes.
I'm sorry I didn't call.
That's okay.
Perhaps you've known.
I was about to make a big mistake.
But I realized at the last minute.
Nothing is more important to me…
than you.
Can I see you?
A strange thing happened…
INCOMING CALL WAKABA
This ship will soon call at the port of Hong Kong
and unship the body of Mr. Sohei Kuruma.
The rest of the Kuruma family
will continue the voyage to attend a meeting in Europe.
Thank you.
-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.
I don't understand.
A family member is dead, but they're continuing the voyage?
You don't need to understand.
Mr. Kuruma didn't die yesterday and he didn't die of illness.
Thinking that there's something behind everything
is a sign that there's something wrong with you.
Right back at you.
What time are we arriving in Hong Kong?
I would say by noon.
I guess it's time to say goodbye.
Shouldn't we do something?
What do you mean?
What is it?
About the murder.
Yes.
What the son said was a total lie.
That's their problem.
So it doesn't concern us?
I'll get off at Hong Kong and go back to Japan.
You only care about yourself?
My boyfriend means more to me…
than a rich dead stranger.
He was going to a hot spring with someone else.
I know, but I shouldn't just accept it and give him up.
He was having an affair.
No, he wasn't. He almost did.
It's the same thing.
You can eat cooked rice, but not when it's almost cooked.
Love is not like rice.
Your boyfriend betrayed you just the same.
What gives you the right to lecture me like that?
Because to me, almost falling in love
is the same as falling in love.
Can't I be a reason for you to stay?
Can't I be the reason for you…
to forget the past and move on?
What are you talking about?
Didn't you hear from your girlfriend? You can just go back to her.
How could I?
Once a ship departs, it can never turn around.
Can you leave?
-I just-- -A crewman…
shouldn't hang out in a guest's room.
I'm very sorry.
DELETE PHOTO?
THERE ARE NO PHOTOS IN YOUR ALBUM.
DELETE PHOTO?
May I have your attention please.
The MSC Bellissima will be arriving in Hong Kong shortly.
We'd like to thank you for boarding with us.
ROOM SERVICE CHOCOLATE-COVERED STRAWBERRIES ORANGE JUICE, WAFFLES, DONUTS
Thank you.
I just pray that there won't be any more trouble.
We offer our deepest apologies for any inconvenience caused.
To all the passengers leaving now,
if you have checked in your luggage,
please make sure you have all your belongings.
We'd like to thank you for boarding the MSC Bellissima.
We hope you enjoyed the six-day voyage
after our departure from Port Hakodate, Hokkaido.
All of us in the crew wish you good health,
and we look forward to serving you again.
We hope…
I sincerely hope to see you again…
someday.
While I continue the voyage,
I will never forget you.
I'm so glad to have met you.
Sailing with you made me so happy.
Ma'am.
Ma'am, you are--
What do you think you're doing?
I'm very sorry.
Alright!
Way to go, Miss!
Mr. Butler.
Ma'am.
What happened?
I forgot something.
Did you?
I came to retrieve it.
What are you doing?
My mother woke up.
She was asking about you.
I think he likes the girl.
He doesn't want to hurt her.
So, he kept silent.
When misfortune befalls the family,
you should be sad.
It is sad to lose someone.
So it's okay to feel sad.
Why do you say that?
Because… you seem to be suffering.
I'm not!
Why are you being so mean?
Miss…
why don't you come live with us?
What?
I don't need you!
Did you see their faces?
I just loved it!
They really thought we were cheating.
If we keep going like this, we can buy this ship!
You can make a down payment.
-No problem. -Seriously?
Take this. Go to the pawnshop and get some money.
No, I'm going to quit.
Don't you want to be in a movie?
I passed the audition I did in Japan.
What's this? A low-budget movie?
I don't care about the budget.
I want to be in a work of art.
Miss?
Stop calling me that.
I'm no longer a boss's daughter and you're not a yakuza anymore.
Are we lovers then?
Shiori.
Ryuki.
When we get to the Aegean Sea-- Ryu-chin.
Who is this… Yuki-pyon?
YUKI-PYON: I'M SO LONELY.
It's not what you think, Miss.
Cut off your finger.
I'm telling you!
At the Cannes Film Festival, people watch movies and eat mussels.
What's wrong with clams?
It's organized by the French government. It's a film festival, do you understand?
So eating mussels with tax money is art?
-Not just mussels! -What else?
Like canelés!
For god's sake!
I'm going back to Japan.
We are heading for the Aegean Sea.
Remember what those guys said?
If a murder happened,
it would take us all back to Japan.
If I show this to them, we can go back to Japan.
What are you doing? Let go!
I'm going back, too.
Let's go!
Come on!
What is it?
Go and study.
Yes, Mother.
The truth is…
Rena is terrible at chess.
Not just chess.
She's terrible at most of the games they play at school.
But she never loses.
Because Rena's father would call the game company
and tell them to change the rules so she could win.
That's why everybody stopped playing with her.
I feel sorry for her.
She eats really expensive strawberries,
but she's never had regular candies sold in convenience stores.
Rena doesn't know she's lonely.
People who don't know that
are the loneliest of all.
Nobody likes Rena.
Even her family.
She has you.
When you care about her like that,
she's not alone.
You can protect her.
Rena and I belong to different social classes.
Social classes don't exist.
We should ask for more humidifiers.
Aren't we attending Grandfather's funeral?
We don't need to.
Mrs. Sakumoto is worried about us.
That housekeeper… is awake now?
Is it going to be okay?
I think so.
Or maybe not.
Perhaps that boy put some wrong ideas into her head.
Did he say something to you?
It should be all right.
Or maybe not.
I'll go and apologize to Kanato.
Why would you apologize to a servant?
Because I was mean to him.
I'll tell him I'm sorry.
Stop it.
I don't want to lose Kanato!
That boy.
He must have heard it from his mother.
It should be fine.
Or maybe not?
Okay, Captain. What's most important for a voyage?
A lot happens in life.
If it's a small problem, you should be able to joke about it.
After all,
all is well as long as the ship doesn't sink.
We are going to sink.
No, we are not.
May I have your attention please…
Rena?
-For your safety, -Kanato!
please follow the crew's instructions
-and return to your rooms. -Kanato!
Rena.
Rena?
-Hey, you! -Stop!
Mr. Banal!
-Give it! -This way!
There!
Kanato!
Kanato! Kanato!
Miss!
Kanato!
That night, there was this person in a cloak.
And I know who it was.
It's one of the doctor's family members.
-What are you doing? -Hey!
Hang on a minute.
Aren't you a butler?
How dare you speak to us like that?
I'm terribly…
Huh? You're terribly what?
I apologize.
You don't sound apologetic at all.
It's okay. Get up.
Come with me. And let's take her.
Not without my permission.
Rena?
Rena!
Come back.
Excuse me, sir.
-What are you doing? -Would you calm down?
How dare you touch me!
I'm terribly sorry.
You're hurting me!
I'm aware of that.
You lowlife menial!
I'm not a lowlife. I'm a butler of this ship.
You son of a bitch!
Shame on you.
Sir.
If I may.
We are the guests.
Yes, and the guests are always right.
However, if I may be frank,
if you consider yourself to be like a god,
then why don't you behave like one?
If I did, we'd need an ambulance.
Please sit down.
Should a butler be doing this?
Our duty is to protect the safety of our passengers.
I can't turn a blind eye to a murder.
Please talk to me.
About what?
The murder scene was recorded.
I think I'll go up to the room first.
Are you just leaving me?
I don't think this has anything to do with me.
It was your father who died.
That's not fair!
Looks like it's going to rain.
Let's call it off.
Oh my.
You are all here.
Please take a look, Captain.
You're beautiful.
What's going on?
Who's that?
What's this?
We saw it.
Those two. They killed him.
Wait, wait.
Give me a break.
I've got nothing to do with this.
The one who murdered him…
was this woman.
Excuse me?
You did it, didn't you?
What are you talking about?
You were there!
You pushed my father into the pool and drowned him!
You had too much to drink!
Did you hear that, Captain?
All I wanted from you was to be my lightning rod--
Captain.
It's not like the ship is going to sink.
Could you explain it to me?
I also have a video.
That night, she took my father out and came to this spot.
She was planning to kill him.
-It was your-- -Because…
my father found out that Rena is not my daughter.
She wanted to silence him.
…I'm going to see my first love.
I'm going to heaven.
How dare you!
Do you mean to tell me you recorded this and just went back to the room?
you recorded this and just went back to the room?
Because I was in shock.
So, who's the man?
Shibata? Osaki? Or Hamaya?
It's Mr. Miki.
Miki?
But seriously, I don't know anything about this.
Excuse me.
Sorry, but can I watch it again?
What is it?
Let's watch it again.
…I'm going to see my first love.
Play it again.
…I'm going to see my first love.
Right there! Again.
Why are you so concerned about his first love?
It's his first love. It stirs up our emotions.
I knew it.
What?
Can we play yours again?
Ready?
-I'm going to see my first love. -You're beautiful.
So what?
I'm sure it's just staged.
Of course, it is--
-The positions are different. -Exactly!
Of course, they are different.
Shot from different spots.
No, the positions are different.
-Positions of what? -The moon.
The moon is in different positions.
This one's on the left.
-This one's on the right. -Exactly.
They were shot at different times.
But the moon shouldn't have moved that much.
No, it wasn't the moon that moved.
Oh, yes, of course.
I turned the rudder.
So, it wasn't the moon that moved,
but this ship.
Before the ship changed direction and after it did.
So, he was pushed over twice.
See? It wasn't me.
I went back to the room right away.
Then, who did it the second time?
Him, of course.
Remember?
I was with you, you know…
Hang on.
There was no water in his lungs.
He died before he fell into the pool.
He had burns on his hands
like he had held something hot.
Electricity?
He held something electric.
Something electric?
Don't worry.
This cane is out of order.
It broke when he held it.
Are you all right?
-Wow! -Gorgeous!
Just like the calendar!
I'll repay you later.
In that case, I'll accept it gladly.
Why?
If I start telling my story,
it'll take too much of your time.
Doctor! Get a doctor!
I'm a doctor.
What's wrong?
No.
You guys are not doctors.
Thank you for everything.
You must wait here until the police arrive.
What if I escape?
The sailors said it was a Siren singing.
Weren't they just seasick?
I guess that's possible.
But I think I've heard it a few times.
The song of a Siren.
I wish there was a hot spring.
Enough of that already.
Let's talk about us.
Did you check the regulations?
Is a crew member allowed to make a pass at a passenger?
It's too late for that.
I don't think so.
We haven't really…
Just shadows.
Our lips weren't touching.
With all due respect,
whether our lips were touching is not the issue in this case.
It's about whether we shared the same feeling.
I'm not really sure about that.
You mean you don't remember?
Not really.
How could you not?
No, I really don't remember.
How about now?
I wonder.
Is it coming back now?
Maybe if you kiss me again.
We've come this far. Why do we have to go back to Japan?
Well, murder is kind of a big thing.
Look. When we get back to Japan, do you want to be in my movie?
It'll make you rich!
I want to introduce you to my dad.
I hope he'll understand my art.
Don't worry.
Dad loves art.
What can I do for you, ma'am?
Please take a seat.
I'm on duty right now.
Do as your guest says.
With all due respect, people who are rude to service workers
are the most foolish ones in the world.
Are you a butler?
Or my lover?
Well…
JAKARTA OCTOBER 19, 1987
A train accident in Bintaro!
Take them to any wards available!
Come on, hurry up!
Here! Quick! Ward Three!
Hurry up! Come on! Take them to the wards!
Doc! Please help my brother!
Calm down, sir! We'll help him! Let's go!
He lost a lot of blood! You're his…
His little brother.
Come on, hurry up!
What's his blood type?
-A, Doc. -Are you sure?
I'm sure.
Nurse, please get a bag of type A blood.
Now! Hurry!
Please wait outside, sir.
We need to begin treatment now.
Please wait outside. Go on, sir.
Brother, be strong, okay?
Wait outside, sir. Please.
Brother…
Sir, please wait outside.
I'm strong…
Sir, hang in there!
Sir, please help.
I'll recover.
Wildan!
Please stay calm, sir.
What's your name, sir?
Narendra.
Mr. Narendra? All right, hold on.
Nurse, please check there.
Narendra!
Bro…
Bro…
It's all right. Don't cry.
It's all right. Please don't cry.
I just washed Wildan's body.
Sis, he's gone!
Easy, please!
Please be careful.
Mom… Hurry up, please!
Doc!
It's okay. We'll take care of her.
BALI OCTOBER 19, 2023
Ang!
Ang, look at me!
Just look at me, Ang.
-Breathe. -Take him to Unit Two.
Breathe.
Ma'am, are you his wife?
No, I'm his co-worker.
-Please wait here. -Okay.
-Have you known him long? -Yes.
It's all right, sir. Please take a deep breath.
Ang, I'm right here, okay?
Breathe slowly.
TODAY WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT DAY
What's wrong? What happened to Angkasa?
He slept in the office and collapsed. I have no idea what happened.
Did you call Lika?
He told me not to!
Call her. What else can we do?
Yeah, but if…
How is he, Doc?
Well, when a person is experiencing a panic attack,
the brain will instruct the nervous system to avoid any further stressors.
Then the body produces adrenaline,
which triggers an increase in heart rate,
respiratory rate, and blood flow to the muscles.
It's the body response to avoid stressful situations.
It seems the patient has been experiencing this for a few days.
I see.
Ndre. Is that you, Ndre?
-Thank you, Doc. -No problem.
Ang? Rest up now, okay?
What happened?
What time is it?
It's almost nine.
Nurse, I feel better. I need to leave, now.
You have to stay the night for observation.
No, I need to leave.
Hey, listen to the doctor.
Nurse, I don't need to stay here. I have to go now.
If you go now, what if something happens to you?
Well, I can always come back here.
Pinkan and I can handle tomorrow's event.
Hey! Come on!
This isn't about the work.
Kan, please handle the medical treatment for me, okay?
Yeah… Hey, where are you going now?
To the airport. My mom will be arriving soon.
What?
So stubborn.
Please, sir. Please make it quick.
It's for our family.
That's the ID card.
-We'll fill out the form first. -Please hurry.
What's wrong?
They said the deceased transportation service was free,
but now they're charging us.
It is free, but only within the Greater Jakarta area.
But there's a fee for East Java!
Sir, please help us.
We don't have the money. Please help us.
We're helping you, but there's a fee for transport outside of Jakarta.
Can I speak with your manager?
Oh gosh, what's wrong with you?
With all due respect,
what's wrong with you?
We're all having a hard time right now.
No need to add insult to injury.
Hey! Who is adding insult to injury? Watch your mouth!
You wanna fight? Come on!
-Come on! -Arai! Knock it off!
-I'll crush you! -Stop!
Sir, please help us.
Come with me.
Hey! How dare you?! Are you looking for trouble too?
-Don't mess with me! -Stop it!
Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you!
So?
There's a way.
But not until tomorrow morning.
Any fees?
It should've been free of charge. We shouldn't make a fuss at the hospital.
If I had stopped him from going, Wildan would still be here today!
Work will always be there.
Work will always be there!
This is my fault.
Hey, it's no use blaming yourself now.
That's enough, Rai.
We've all lost Wildan.
Narendra shouldn't be the one to console you.
It's okay.
-Hey, Arai! -Rai. What's wrong with you?
Let me go home first and pack up some clothes.
We'll take Wildan home, okay?
-Please bring my clothes. -Okay.
They're on the top shelf.
I'll make you some food. Agus will bring it here.
Sis.
Can I have some coins? I want to call back home.
Okay, I have some.
Here. I'll be going now.
-Thank you. -You take care.
I will.
Wildan…
Hello, sis. It's Narendra.
Wildan will be home by tomorrow evening.
Please pray for Wildan, okay?
I'll be doing the best I can for Wildan, so he can get home safe.
Yeah, sis.
Excuse me.
Was your family a victim of the train accident too?
My mother has thalassemia.
She needs immediate surgery.
But they ran out of blood here.
I've been trying to contact the Red Cross,
but no answer.
My father is still out of town.
I lost my brother this afternoon…
because they ran out of blood too.
What I mean is,
maybe you should just go there.
To the Red Cross's office.
All right.
Hey, miss?
I could go there with you, if you want.
Maybe if they see me like this, it will get their attention.
…in the train accident that occurred in Pondok Betung, Bintaro, South Jakarta,
casualties have increased to over 76 total victims
and around 450 people injured as of tonight.
I'm so sorry to trouble you.
Victims are trapped in the train…
You did just lose your brother.
You're also injured, but now you're here, helping me.
…the collision between two trains…
My brother might have survived if he hadn't tried to save me.
So now I have a good reason to do the same for others.
Both diesel trains are for passenger transport,
which caused a sudden collision.
Each of the trains…
Lika, are you at the airport?
Yes, Mom. I'm already here. But I haven't seen Dad yet.
Angkasa?
Yeah, I'm here with him.
Where is he?
He's right here. Wanna talk to him?
Yes.
It's Mom.
Yes?
Angkasa, your phone's not turned on.
You're not coming, Mom?
No, your father is.
I don't know what you're dealing with exactly,
but I'm sure you'll need your father more than you need me.
How are you, Dad?
Hey, Lik. Are you good?
-I'm good. -Really?
-Dad. -Hey, Ang!
Are you good?
-Let's get some food. I'm starving. -Wait here.
I'll go get the car.
Okay.
Lika's leaving already. She must be very busy.
But I'm glad she could come pick me up at the airport.
Ang.
Eat up.
We'll be living here in Jakarta. Come on!
Arai!
This is my little brother, Narendra.
-Arai. -Narendra.
Where are the others?
-Sis! -Sis!
Sis! How are you?
-Gus! -Hey! You're here!
Yeah. This is Sis Inah.
Oh my God, you're handsome.
Yeah.
This is Mr. Amper, Inah's husband.
Cover it up, silly.
What's all the fuss?
Well, this is my little brother.
-Agus. -Narendra.
Don't be shy. Just relax, okay?
-Okay, then. -Narendra.
Your brother said that you're going to college soon?
That's right.
That's great!
There's finally someone with higher education here.
-Am I right? -Absolutely.
Listen, Narendra. What Wildan gets from work, he spends on food,
What Wildan gets from work, he spends on food,
and the rest he saves up to put you through college. That's it.
All right, that's enough. Go freshen up.
He had a long trip.
-We'll go out tomorrow. -Yes.
Come on. Let me show you our room.
That's our room there.
And that's the bathroom. Go take a shower!
Bro, please move the chair.
This table is Mr. Amper's, but you can use it to study.
Now put your clothes on the top shelf of the wardrobe.
I emptied that space out some time ago. Just for you.
We'll share a room for now.
Tomorrow, if we find a cheaper house, we'll rent it
so you'll be more comfortable.
No, it's fine.
The people here are nice.
Well, true. They're a lot like a family, right?
You need to study hard, focus, and don't worry about anything else.
Look out there. It's a big city.
It's tough to live here.
Hear me out, okay?
While I'm still in shape
and can work to put you through college, you have to focus on your studies.
Got it? So we can turn our life around.
-Okay? -I hear you.
Narendra! My mom!
My mom made it through!
Thank you.
She's moved to another room, so I went out to look for you.
-Make sure… -That's my dad.
…my wife's well taken care of.
-We will. If you'll excuse me. -Okay.
Dad.
This is Narendra, the one I told you about.
He helped me get a blood donor for Mom.
Thank you so much.
-Dad, I'm going to go see Mom. -Okay.
Come on.
-What? -Come on.
Excuse me, sir.
Get some money to pay him.
If you weren't there,
maybe I wouldn't see her smile again.
Thanks again.
Ajeng, I think we should leave now.
We'll be back tomorrow, okay?
Mr. Wirjawan.
Mr. Mitro.
Ajeng? I apologize for coming late.
Let me introduce you. That's Narendra.
He helped me get a blood donor for Mom.
Really?
Wirjawan. Her boyfriend.
-Narendra. -Thanks.
Sir, this is from Mr. Soemitro.
-There's no need-- -Please, take it.
She's stable.
-Afternoon, sir. -Hi.
Ang, did you move out?
Ang.
Excuse me.
Sir.
Whose place is this?
We'll be staying here.
We'll be staying here for a while.
Wait. Lika's not here, Ang?
Ang?
Did you two have a fight?
All right. If you don't talk to me, I can always ask Lika.
Dad.
Dad, stay out of it. This is my problem.
I see why you asked your mom to come here.
Ang.
In marriages, we can overcomplicate simple things in our minds sometimes.
I've been there.
-Don't act like you're the best. -Hey!
If you don't like the way I'm protecting you,
then fine!
I've been here for three weeks. I haven't seen Lika in a while.
We are having problems.
Our relationship isn't good.
But please, stay out of it.
I asked Mom to come. I needed her take, not yours.
I have some work to do. Feel free to come or not.
Thank you, sir.
-Are you all done? -Yeah.
-You want to go now? -Let's.
Are we still on for tomorrow?
Dinner at the Trio?
I've been wanting to eat there, but never got the chance.
It's my treat now.
Thanks for the ride.
Go on, get to work. Take care, okay?
Drive safely, okay?
ELLYAS PICAL, INDONESIA'S BOXING ARENA SUPERHERO
Let me tell you something. Sukardi will win!
Elly's in bad shape!
You're way too overconfident!
Bro, I'm positive
that Sukardi will be KO'd in the third round.
Oh, you wanna bet?
-Bet? Let's! -With pleasure!
-Your money's on round three? -Yeah.
My money's on the fourth. IDR 100,000.
Go ahead and gamble. Forget about making money!
Gambling's making money too.
That's right. Wanna bet, Narendra?
No, I'm broke.
You got no money, but you're still dating?
I'm better off spending money on dates.
I'm not like you, who always gambles or buys lottery tickets.
You know me.
He has a point.
Bro!
-Come here. -Has it started already?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sure of it!
Sukardi will win!
Don't compare them.
Going to see your girlfriend?
Yeah, I'm off.
You look like a model, Narendra.
I'm late.
Hey, Ellyas Pical got some new moves!
Yes?
Good, you're ready.
Wirjawan's already here. Come on.
Don't keep him waiting.
But you'll be there tomorrow, right?
Of course I will.
Great, because my father asked me to make sure that you'll come.
He wants to introduce you to investors from Hong Kong.
I see. Right.
You should take Ajeng with you too, Wirjawan.
So, when you two are married,
she's accustomed to the experience.
Relax. You don't have to worry.
Just dress up, look pretty,
and stand next to me. I'll introduce you to the people there.
Everyone can stop asking, "Hey, where's your fiancée?"
You're right.
It's a business event.
What would people say if an official's daughter is there?
Don't worry about it. That's normal.
No, Ajeng's right, dear.
If it's a business event, it'll be better if Ajeng doesn't come.
Ajeng, you still have to attend.
Your relationship needs to be made public.
Are you ready to order?
Not yet.
It's a very tense match indeed!
Elly's punch, which didn't find its target, wasted a ton of energy.
Elly's signature left hook once again!
A right jab from Elly!
He's still pressing, and they are in round seven. Samsul.
Still a tie…
…there's no rest
Always being reminded of you
Is this what it's like
-All right! -When two are in love?
Why?
-Why does everything look so wonderful? -Dance, sis!
-So amazing to see -As if
As if I want to always smile
But how embarrassed I am
He's here!
Hey! What's the matter with you?
You had a date, but didn't see each other? Come on, join in!
Whose laser disc player is that?
Someone asked me to fix it.
I just finished repairing it. Now Agus is testing it.
I'm sorry.
Wirjawan came by to talk about business with Dad.
That's why I came late.
When I got there, you were already gone.
So I came here.
We'll reschedule the date, okay?
Is it okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
Let's reschedule the date.
Jeng, you need to sing this song!
-You can do it. Just sing, okay? -Okay.
Here, you come and sing too.
What…
YOU BEAUTIFUL ONE
-Come with me! -Where to? I'm still working, Jeng!
Stop asking questions. Come on! Hurry!
My gosh. Where are we going? Come on, tell me.
Just trust me, okay?
-Just get in. Okay, sit. There! -But…
Ready?
Ready for what?
Where are we going?
Seriously, where?
Just relax.
So, it's a secret?
-Whose house is this? -What?
Are you trying to kill me?
If I'd known, I would've gone home to get changed. I stink!
It's fine. So my mom knows what I smell every day.
-Jeng… -Come on.
Mom!
Here.
Finally, we get to meet.
Ma'am.
Relax, this is my mom's house.
My dad doesn't know about it.
All right.
-It's okay. -Jeng.
So, you came all the way to Jakarta to be with your brother?
Wildan came here first.
The truth is, Wildan almost got married,
but when our parents passed away,
he canceled it and went to Jakarta instead.
Your parents passed away?
My mom and dad passed away five years ago.
In an excavation site.
I was still in high school.
That's why after I graduated,
Wildan insisted that I go to college in Jakarta.
When Wildan passed away, all I could think of
was how I could quickly finish my studies and grant his wish.
To be successful.
To work hard.
What's your major?
Industrial engineering. I do a lot of counting and calculating.
Now I work part-time
as an inventory clerk at my landlord's fish auction.
So, I apologize
for smelling so bad.
You…
reminded me…
of Ajeng's older brother.
A year before the accident, Dad threw him out
as he insisted on being a photographer.
Arya was stubborn.
Always picking a fight with Dad and having his own will.
So Mom got that house
just in case Dad left nothing for Arya.
But he didn't really care.
I mean, he traveled a lot and was barely home.
But Arya's brave.
He…
always wanted to live on his own money.
He refused to remain dependent on his parents.
I was so worried when he left home.
But he told me, "No one knows what lies ahead."
"If you work hard, one day you'll be able to reap what's been sown."
Too bad he didn't live long.
He didn't get the chance to succeed,
to prove himself to Dad.
Ang.
If you don't want me here, I can go home on a late flight tonight.
It's fine.
You know what I'm dealing with.
The least you could do is not add to the drama.
Okay. Don't be long.
Ndre! Where's Pinkan?
-She's over there. -Okay.
Hi, Uncle!
-Hi, Ndre. -Just by yourself?
I came with Angkasa.
No, I mean, where's Aunty?
Oh, she's not coming.
Why are you here?
I told you today's busy.
Why don't you get some rest?
The hotel manager wants to meet us.
There'll be a conference next month. He wants us to meet the client.
So go see him, and tell him to meet at…
-And… -The lounge, okay?
Okay, I'll go get my bag first.
You knew about this?
I had a feeling, but I didn't expect that he'd moved out.
I thought it was just a normal spat between the two of them.
So I figured it'd be better if you went there.
Do you know what the issue is?
Not yet. He wouldn't tell me.
He wouldn't listen to what I had to say, let alone talk to me.
Maybe you should hear him out first before you give him your opinion.
Maybe you really should've been the one to come down here, not me.
I think this might be the right time for you two to be together.
If all this time you've been feeling like he's been pushing you away,
now might be the right time to fix it.
Angkasa needs you, dear.
All right, then.
Lika always refuses me. She doesn't want me near her.
That's why I needed Mom's perspective as a woman.
Does it have to be her?
Why don't you just ask Lika?
I did, but she never answered me.
She kept saying that we have a problem,
but whenever I asked her, she never told me.
It's because you have communication issues.
What communication issues? She's never answered my questions on that.
When was the last time you two spoke with one another?
Speaking like two people who want the same thing.
A heart-to-heart conversation,
not because of any issues.
It's been a while, no?
Lika and I talk every day.
She needs someone to talk to.
That's why she sees Billy, right? As she needs someone to talk to?
Why did you bring him up?
Don't tell me that you believe they're just friends.
I mean, they are just friends.
Maybe Lika needed a friend to confide in, so…
It's like this. Billy, in Lika's life, is like me in her life.
-A friend. -Go meet with the manager, okay?
Angkasa, where are you going now?
I need to see that guy.
What? Why? Wait.
Angkasa!
Ang!
Angkasa!
Angkasa!
Angkasa!
Sa!
Were you hospitalized this morning?
No, don't get mad at Pinkan.
I'm still your wife.
I need to know these things.
Need to know what?
That I had a panic attack?
That I'm not ready for our meeting tonight?
I thought I could trust you.
But at the time…
Ang…
Really? From Jakarta? I was in Jakarta too.
Andre!
Andre! Stop him!
Come on, Ndre! Go after him! Andre!
Hurry up! Chase him!
Go get Angkasa!
What is it this time?
Let his dad handle this.
He's going after Billy!
It'll be so exciting.
Angkasa!
What's wrong with you?
You can come with me.
I want to talk to my dad
about not wanting to marry Wirjawan.
Are you sure?
I feel like I can be myself here.
And be free.
As long as you're here…
as long as we have each other…
I believe in us.
You do too, right?
Yes, I do.
Bye.
What?
He's great, isn't he?
Yeah, that's why he's on TV.
What's his name?
How should I know?
Hey, come on!
Mr. Mitro.
I apologize for what Ajeng has done.
It's all right.
I won't let my father hear about this.
I've sent him a warning.
I don't think he has the guts to fight back.
Now it's all up to you and Ajeng.
It'd be a shame to let a trivial issue like this
ruin our families' good relationship.
That's right.
Once again, I apologize.
I'd better go now.
Good evening.
Your daughter is a fool!
Ajeng doesn't understand the consequences of her actions! Idiot!
If Wirjawan gets his heart broken and asks his father to take revenge,
I'll lose my position!
I'll lose it!
Your children can only think about themselves!
While I…
I have to think about the fate of this family.
Think!
I failed with my first child.
Your son!
A man, but with no sense of responsibility towards his family.
You teach Ajeng
to not make a fool out of this family!
Don't ruin what I've spent decades building!
You're already going against your father's wishes.
Now he feels humiliated.
But they didn't have to beat him up.
Your engagement with Wirjawan…
will be made official soon.
Mom.
You still believe in my decision, don't you, Mom?
I don't want to doubt your decisions.
I'm just afraid
that fate will have something far worse in store for you.
Ang!
Slow down, Ang!
Angkasa, this is a small lane!
You drive, then.
Where are we heading?
South Kuta, Dad.
Why are we heading to South Kuta?
You're rushing for no reason.
Gosh!
DAD, HELP, ANGKASA PROBABLY WANTS TO START A FIGHT AT BILLY'S
Who's Billy?
You can be silent about Lika,
but if you want to fight with someone, I need to know why.
Billy is her boyfriend.
Really?
Do you have any proof?
Billy is her old friend in Jakarta.
He moved here, and that's why Lika's always visiting him now.
That's not a good reason for you to accuse her of cheating.
It's obvious! Billy's been after Lika for years!
He took advantage of this situation.
That's what you think. It might not be true!
I want to find the answer there.
How?
By forcing him to confess?
You can't go in there all angry. You have to stay calm.
Listen, Ang.
You have to be ready for two possibilities.
If you're wrong, you have to bear the consequences.
But if you're right, you need to be ready to face your own feelings.
None of these will be easy.
South Kuta is still some ways away. We can still turn back.
We're still going, Dad. I'll show you the way.
Okay.
Hello, may I speak with Ajeng?
I'm sorry. Miss Ajeng isn't home, sir.
When will she be home?
I'm sorry, miss. It was an order from Mr. Sumitro.
You don't need to worry, Wirjawan. I can handle it.
Send my regards to your dad.
Narendra.
Don't go to Ajeng's house! You'll get yourself into trouble.
Stay here instead.
Good boy.
You gotta understand, we're just common folk.
Hey, Gus, bro.
I'm not done yet.
Bro, talk some sense into him! He's dead if he gets caught again.
"Dead"? Why me? Let Mr. Amper handle it.
Please talk to him. There he is.
Hey, Narendra.
Come here. We need to talk.
Move.
What's this?
We need to get one thing straight from now on.
I think of all of us as family here. You understand that, right?
Narendra.
I was young once.
And young blood can be very fiery.
There are stories,
acts of kindness, language,
aesthetics,
even flights of fancy!
Do you know why that is?
It's because of young blood.
You blather too much! Young blood…
-Get to the point! -You see?
You know I can't do serious talk, but you all made me do it anyway.
-You go ahead! -Let me do the talking!
-You take too long. -What's going on? Is this about Ajeng?
Right! Ajeng.
Narendra.
Can't you find someone who won't get you beaten up?
If only we'd known Ajeng already had a fiancé,
we'd all be against this!
Who asked for your approval anyway?
I didn't mean it like that, Narendra.
Listen, you're like a little brother to me.
We're all family.
We don't want anything bad to happen to you.
Just look at you. You're all bruised up.
You're lucky it stopped at this.
If you end up dead, then what?
You've been coming home late for days just to stand in front of her house.
How long do you plan to keep this up?
What Mr. Amper said was right.
Arai.
Inah too.
We're all like siblings.
We have an obligation to remind you.
Don't get yourself into trouble.
You all didn't know that it's an arranged marriage!
She doesn't want this!
We get it. Rich kids are destined to marry other rich kids.
And who are you, Narendra?
I got her mom's blessing. That's enough for me.
-Ren, remember Wildan's wishes. -Gus.
I have never forgotten my brother's wish.
I'm graduating soon anyway.
-Hey, you… -What?
Enough already!
So, what's your plan?
Hold on a second.
Shit!
Dad!
You're not allowed to do that here!
Whoa! You startled me!
No peeing in the open in Bali!
-What then? -It's bad karma!
Gosh! Wait for me, Ang!
Gosh.
Was that serious or a joke?
I'm serious, Dad. We have to respect Mother Nature here.
-Or you'll get bad karma. -What?
You knew but didn't warn me. You'll get bad karma too.
What? I practically jumped out of the car to stop you.
It's too late now!
You got out of the car just like that.
-You pulled down your zipper and urinated. -Why, you…
Speaking of karma,
your mom and I got a story that I've never told you before.
What story?
Well,
it's when I stole your mom from her boyfriend.
Jeez, what crazy secret is it this time?
Mr. Soegiarto, welcome.
Mr. Sumitro, how have you been?
-I've been well. -Good.
Pardon me for only visiting now.
Thank you for coming.
-This is my wife. -Mrs. Murni.
-Please come in. -Thank you.
-Wirjawan. -Mr. Mitro. You're very dashing.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
-What's going on? -What is it?
You really don't know?
We really don't know.
But you live together. How come you wouldn't know?
Well…
Sure, we live together, but this is a…
Hey!
You all gave the same answer! You're all in on this, aren't you?
Your friend kidnapped the daughter of a dignitary!
You could be charged as accomplices!
It's not kidnapping if they love each other.
So, you do know?
You said they love each other. Then you know, right?
-No, sir. -You said--
Hey! He said he didn't know!
Why are you so rowdy in my house?
-Calm down. -They're pissing me off! I'm furious!
Why is it wet here?
Watch out! It's wet here.
You wet your pants?
-It's wet all over. What's up, Arai? -Oh my…
Gosh!
Be careful on your way back, officers. Don't come back again, okay?
What did I say? Narendra went too far.
Why didn't he tell us that she's an important person's daughter?
I told him that if he wanted a girl, get a village girl. It's safer.
But you said earlier that you didn't know.
What else could I have said?
Listen, we're in the clear for now.
But if we get caught lying…
How are we lying?
We don't know where Narendra and Ajeng are right now.
Yeah, we aren't lying if we genuinely don't know!
We do know.
-No, we don't. -We do.
-No, we don't! -Hold on, sis.
Gus, let me ask you.
You knew Narendra went to elope with Ajeng, right?
I thought they went out for dinner.
If they went out and never came back, it's called eloping, Agus!
You're right.
-You know what that means? -Yes.
Sorry, sis, Mr. Amper.
Who rented a car to help Narendra kidnap Ajeng?
He did!
That's me all right!
But I didn't know it would come to this!
Right. He didn't know. What's wrong with you?
It's true we didn't fully know, but if the officers find out…
Here, see? We'll be behind bars. We'd be done for.
Maybe if it's like in the movies,
they'll probably start spying on us.
They've been spying on us for ages, Agus!
Hey! Are you a spy?
Gosh!
Gus, it's Ali, Haji Najib's son.
Haji Najib?
You know what? This ruins everything.
We already owe that family a lot.
That's your debt.
Your position.
Not Ajeng's.
This is for her own good!
-For her and her children's sake. -No!
At first, I supported it,
because I thought she was fine with the decision.
But now I know she's made her own choice.
So, you still don't know where they are now?
The point isn't Wirjawan or your grandfather, Ang.
But, well, that's love.
Relationships become more meaningful if we fight for them.
If you want to be certain about what you know,
then I can only give you one piece of advice. Do it with honor.
At least don't embarrass Lika.
-Let's go. -You wait here.
I'm serious. Don't come in.
Right hand to your upper thigh.
Now raise your left hand above your ears.
Mountain pose.
I dreamed of Mom yesterday.
She smiled.
She also looked wistful.
It's been a week.
I haven't heard from her.
We could go see how she's doing, if you'd like.
Dad must be piling the blame on her.
I'm scared.
I'm scared
that something might happen to Mom…
while I'm not there.
Hello, Bro Arai?
This is what's best for us now.
I don't want you to continue to regret and feel guilty…
about something terrible that might happen to your mom.
But you also need to know
that Dad will do anything to destroy you.
Including getting the cops involved.
Then,
I'll do whatever it takes to survive.
Trust me.
You're with a man who has suffered too many losses in his life.
He doesn't want others to experience the same thing he did.
Especially you.
So now,
what are you going to do?
I'll find some legal assistance.
No lawyer
would ever think of going against your father.
Then we need your help again, Mom.
I've already done what I can.
Mom…
When you believe in something…
don't give up on it so easily.
A man with no future like you…
dares to ruin my daughter's life?
Eloping of all things!
I never kidnapped anyone.
You messed with the wrong person!
I'll make your life miserable.
Don't bother reminding me that I'm poor.
I know
and am fully aware.
But luckily, even though I'm poor,
your daughter, Ajeng,
still believes in me.
Don't ever think you'll get legal assistance!
I'll make things difficult for you.
I'll ruin the life of anyone who has anything to do with you!
Go on and try then, sir. Feel free.
If we really love the same person…
neither of us should be afraid of losing to the other.
Hey!
There's a first for a lot of things,
including losing.
"Their laughter was full of joy."
"But suddenly, it's as if their last laugh was swallowed by a giant."
"Fading away."
Ma'am.
Jeng, can we talk for a moment?
I've always wanted to make you my wife.
You know that would bring us down, right?
We grew up together as teenagers.
That's why I appreciate you as a friend.
But I never wanted us to be more than that.
I don't want this arrangement.
Maybe before, it seemed fine.
But after Narendra came into my life…
I finally see what I truly want.
I want to choose freely with no one interfering.
You have a right to be happy…
with a girl who truly loves you.
And she's not me.
You should've seen how Narendra made your dad so upset.
So reckless.
But then I realized…
where you got that courage from.
Ridwan.
Jeng.
Here's some money.
It's enough to pay Narendra's bail.
-Thank you. -No problem.
I won't deny it.
I've always had a thing for Lika. Way before you two met.
And whatever's going on with you two is what made us get close again.
But I don't want to be that guy who takes advantage of someone's problem.
I was gonna make a scene here.
I'd do the same if I were you, honestly.
I just want to know what exactly is going on.
Lika needs someone to talk to.
And it could be anyone out there.
It could be me,
or someone else with good or bad intentions.
But one thing's for sure.
We're the same.
That's why she came here often, even when there's no class.
What do you mean?
She never told you that I was married?
It ended because of a one-sided obsession.
Never use your marriage as a way of proving yourself.
The same goes for kids.
Ang.
I'm not really the right person to give advice.
Who am I to, right?
But at least I've been there.
Lika said you two moved to Bali to get out of your father's shadow.
She also said that you always wanted to prove to yourself
that you can be better than him. I've been there.
At first, you think it's a goal, but in reality, it's just an obsession.
We keep finding ways to justify pursuing it.
As if it's true.
As if it's a remedy.
But in the end, we only end up hurting the people who love us.
I've been waiting for this moment.
Did Lika tell you I was coming?
Nope. It's been almost a month since I've heard from Lika.
I came to you
and you
to let you guys know
that Ajeng and I will openly continue our relationship.
This is our mutual agreement.
Ajeng.
Choose now!
Either you stay in this house,
with all the conveniences you've had since you were a kid,
or suffer in life with a man with no future!
Choose!
You already know…
which I'll choose.
You two have my blessing.
But I'll stay here, to be with your dad.
After all, he's still my husband.
Mom.
Thanks, Mom.
Narendra.
Please take good care of my daughter.
Love becomes far more meaningful when you fight for it.
I will, ma'am.
How many kilograms?
-Eighty kilograms. -Okay.
Break time!
Hey, you got drinks!
That's refreshing.
-It's good. -Where are you going, Gus?
Are you a fisherman or a snake dancer? Here, drink up, Gus.
It's from Mr. Amper.
Wow!
There's a lot, too. Come on.
It smells perfect.
-You want more? -A little more.
Our boss wants this house vacated immediately!
Who are you? Can't you keep it down?
It's still early…
Open it, Dad.
Open the window!
Dad!
What?
I'm married.
I have my own life now.
You can't worm your way into it anymore.
Besides, this is Mom's house, not yours!
You chose to leave, right?
I no longer have anything to do with you.
But this house is a family asset.
So it no longer yours to use.
You chose that man.
Face the music.
Find another place to live. I have nothing more to do with you.
-You have no right to evict me! -Drive.
Hey!
That house is mine!
You took it from them without telling me!
And you too!
You bought that house without my permission!
You should've been on my side, not supporting a daughter who chose to leave her family.
Ajeng is still my daughter!
If I want to help her, then that's my right!
I'll never let them have that house back.
Then I'll have to take this to the court.
You…
You're seriously going to sue your own husband?
Really?
Yes.
If that's what it takes to protect my daughter's happiness.
Come on. Let's eat.
Don't think about it for now.
Let's eat first, okay?
This is good.
Eat up, Ajeng. It's good.
Thank you.
JOB VACANCY CLOSED
Sir, why is it closed?
We're good. Drive!
I'm sorry I came by unannounced.
Mom just wants to help you, to help us.
Why did you refuse her?
I don't want any more help from your parents.
I don't want to bring shame on us.
Mom can actually help you find a job.
She's well-connected.
The more odd-jobs you take,
the harder it is for you to finish your studies.
You don't believe me?
You don't believe in us?
I can find work too.
You don't have to take on all of this by yourself.
Ajeng!
There's nothing wrong with being born poor.
What's bad is if you make no effort to turn your life around.
That's why I want you to attend college.
A good education will open the door to life's opportunities.
And, well,
I took you to work when I had time…
so you'd have some experience.
So you know making money is hard.
One day,
when you succeed,
that's the day when I finally succeed too.
When the going gets tough…
the tough get going.
Don't give up easily.
Sorry for bringing you into my miserable life.
But you're my responsibility now.
I'll do my best so that you won't regret it.
I've accepted the risks.
Because I know…
that we can make it together.
I won't let you carry this by yourself.
You have to trust me too.
If all we did back then was to survive…
now is our time to thrive.
Together.
The key, Dad.
-How was it? -We need to talk.
Do you know why I moved here?
I know.
You wanted to start a business, right?
You said that Bali is a lucrative place for events.
So I could stay away from you,
Mom,
and from that house.
Did I say no?
Aurora went to London, and you went to Bali.
Did I forbid you? No, right?
Now that you have problems with Lika, am I the one to blame for that too?
That's just it, Dad.
This family seems fine.
Everyone's happy. You two are still together.
You're able to provide for us, and we are free to pursue our passions.
It's perfect.
So, what do you want?
One of the things that caused me and Lika to quarrel
was because I told her I wanted to have children…
so I could prove that I can be a better father than you.
She was upset to hear that.
But today, I realized…
that I'm the problem.
You're like a wound in my life.
You are my champion, you know?
You're the greatest testament to your mother and I.
If all I've been doing this whole time is ruining your life, please forgive me.
The government regulation that simplifies the banking establishment's terms
has caused a surge in the establishment of new banks.
These new banks are attracting many professionals.
If you get nauseous, just go straight home, okay?
I'm fine.
Just relax.
Oh gosh.
That darn perfume!
You're handsome.
You two are incredible.
The husband's working at a bank. The wife's working at a telephone company.
What a couple.
Don't work too hard. Take care of your pregnancy.
When will we get to work in an office?
Gus, if you want to join in the success, go touch a successful person's tie.
Touch it. There.
Have you eaten yet?
-Not yet. -Come, I'll make you dinner.
Do you have anything in the fridge?
-I haven't shopped yet. -It's fine. I'll cook for you tonight.
My fried rice is the best.
-I'll take it, Dad. -Okay.
Lik.
If all this time the way I've been to my children
has been a burden on you and Angkasa…
please forgive me.
I understand
that I'm the cause of the wound in Angkasa's life.
And you've had to go through all of this.
I'll come with you to the doctor tomorrow.
Okay.
We are two people who lost our way.
We just need to find each other.
INCOMING CALL
-Yes? -Hello, Mr. Angkasa.
I'm on the crossroads.
-What? -Do I go straight or make a U-turn?
Hold a second--
I've cancelled tonight's appointment with my lawyer.
Hello?
Hello?
So, what is gonna be?
Sir, Lika and I have agreed to cancel the appointment.
What was that?
Ajeng.
Yes, dear?
I miss Mom all of a sudden.
Where are you going?
Ajeng is in labor.
It's a boy.
Thank God!
Congratulations.
Congratulations!
Ajeng and the baby are healthy, sis.
Goodness, I'm so happy for you!
-Thank you. -Congratulations!
Come here.
You made sure the baby has ten fingers, right?
Of course.
Gus, I'm pretty sure you were given essential oils
instead of fish oil, so you ended up short.
He's clueless.
Gosh!
Hello, sir.
Congratulations.
How is my grandchild?
It's a boy, sir.
He's a healthy boy.
