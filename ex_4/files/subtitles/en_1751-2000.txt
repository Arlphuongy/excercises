It's me, Chrissy.
-Is the tub full of water? -Yep.
-Got the bubbles? -Yep.
-Extra towels? -Extra extra.
Let’s do it.
Chrissy! It’s time for your…
-Huh? -Chrissy?
No bath time!
Can’t catch me!
Come back, you little hubcap! It’s…
All right, little lady. You have nowhere to go!
Let’s all just go home and take a nice, warm bath.
No!
Ready for that bath?
No, thank you.
Go!
Stay on her tail. I'll cut her off at the pass!
-Why aren’t you in school? -Why aren’t you at work?
Touché.
Come back here!
I’m gonna get you!
No!
I got ya!
I don’t got ya.
-You fall for that every time. -Just catch that toddler.
Get back here, Chrissy!
Another peaceful day in Bumperton Hills.
Chrissy!
Hey, slow down!
Hey! Slow down.
Hey, get back here!
Hi, Wilder!
Hi, Chrissy!
Bath time?
Bath time.
Good luck!
You too. Call me later!
She’s getting away, Mrs. C.
Not helpful, Halle.
Can't catch me!
Yeah!
Get her, honey!
Got you!
Tub’s almost full.
All right, Chrissy. You ready?
No.
-Come on. It’s your turn to take a bath. -Then me next!
What? I love baths.
You could teach Chrissy to love baths. What do you think, Chrissy?
She's good.
-Chrissy! -Chrissy!
Amazing!
-Amazing? -Look!
A box?
No!
Pretend.
See?
Box… with drawing?
Box? No!
House. Come inside.
It’s dark. Can’t see.
Hold on.
Better?
Come over here.
What's this?
TV! Use the remote.
What?
Pretend!
Time to go downstairs.
Now, Chrissy with the weather.
Up next, tornado!
I am a robot.
There are people! Stairs! Tornado!
Now what?
It’s just a hole.
Not a hole. Mirror!
-Boo! -Boo!
What now?
What?
What is it?
Volcano!
Hot!
Pretend.
We’re trapped.
Way out!
Let’s jump. Ready?
Broken.
I know!
Pirate ship! Ahoy, matey.
Arr, matey!
We sail!
Choppy water.
What's next?
No more marker!
No…
All done.
I know! Close your eyes and pretend really hard.
Look!
Yay! Pretend!
-Let's go! -Hold on.
-Yay! -Yay!
Yay!
Hi, Carley!
Hey, Chrissy. You look so cute bouncing on that trampoline.
Really?
Of course. Chrissy, you are just the cutest thing ever!
I’ll see you later.
I’m so cute!
Hey, Bobby.
What you doing? Blowing dandelions? Making wishes?
-You are just the cutest thing ever! -What?
Thank you.
Keep trying, little guy. You can do it.
Oh, hello.
So cute!
Oh, did someone fall down? Looks like someone needs some holding.
Woof!
You’re a little puppy!
Meow.
So cute.
Woof!
Meow.
Cute!
Carley!
Yes, cutie?
Oh, gesundheit.
Excuse you.
Gesundheit.
Gesundheit. I mean, excuse you!
So cute. All so cute!
Yes, cutie?
You’re giving me candy?
You’re giving me money?
Thank… you?
So cute!
Oh, I love it!
Yeah!
Oh, I don’t know that song.
Cute.
Oh, is that Beethoven?
This is all so very cute.
-What is it, Bobby? -I love…
What do you love, Bobby?
Don’t you dare.
I love you, Carley.
That is the cutest thing ever!
What is it?
Well, my dad was gonna throw it out, but I saved it,
because it reminded me of you.
Timeless.
Oh, Brett!
You are the cutest!
Thanks, Carley.
Wanna go help me add it to my gallery space?
Okay.
-Teenagers. -Teenagers.
Snacky snack!
Here you go, Chrissy. I got you a special treat.
Yay!
Raisins!
Raisins?
Yuck.
Raisins are good for you, and make Mummy feel better
Raisins are good for you, and make Mummy feel better about that milkshake I gave you yesterday.
Cookie!
Yay!
Come back, cookie!
-Bye, Daddy. -Bye!
Hi, Daddy.
-Hi! -Oh, hello there, Chrissy.
Chasing a cookie in a jar, I see.
I remember the first time I chased a sugary snack.
Fastest crumb cake I ever… Don’t mean to be rude, but I’m going left. Bye!
-Bye, Mr. Coaltrain! -Hope you catch your cookie!
Come back!
Hey, wait up.
Wait for me!
Got ya.
Hey, kids. Who wants a healthy snack?
-Cookie! -Cookies!
What? Cookies?
No. I brought oranges.
-Cookie! -Cookies!
I…
I don’t have any cookies!
Please don’t eat me! I’m not as sweet as I look!
Oh no!
Oh no!
You ate all your raisins! Good job, Chrissy.
I think you deserve a cookie.
Cookie!
Here you go.
The last oatmeal raisin cookie.
Raisins?
What?
Baby Unicar! Colours so bright!
Travels the universe…
Baby Unicar! Colours so bright! Travels the uni--
Chrissy!
Now, you know we don’t draw on the wall…
Is that me?
Wait. No. No drawing on the wall.
Put the chalk down.
That is not what I meant! Chrissy, I'm warning you.
That's it! Time out!
No!
Chrissy, stay on the couch until time out is over.
I set this timer for five minutes.
Stay there until the face goes from sad to happy. I’ll be in the other room.
Baby Unicar! Colours so bright!
Whatever.
Travels the universe Making wrongs right
No.
Yay, ball!
-Stay on the couch until time out is over. -But, Daddy--
No more talking, please.
Yeah!
Baby Unicar! Colours so bright!
Yes! Baby Unicar!
Travels the universe Making--
-Oh no! -No TV during time outs.
Well, at least it comes off easy.
My boot's not that big.
All done!
Baby Unicar! Colours so…
Daddy?
I was just fixing it.
-No, Chrissy, I was just-- -That’s it! Time out!
No!
Fair is fair.
Okay, Daddy. Don’t leave sofa until sad to happy.
Chrissy, you set it for an hour.
No more talking, please. Bye-bye.
Oh boy.
-Where to next, everybody? -Last one to the ball pit’s a rusty car!
Chrissy want!
Bobby Mini Van.
Chrissy Carson.
Are you two eyeing that big Baby Unicar toy?
One hundred tickets is a lot, but totally worth it. It’s our last one.
It’s on!
Three, two, one, go!
Oh yeah.
Oh no!
Banana peel.
Energy boost!
Yay, boost!
You got fourth place!
Yay, tickets!
Only one ticket?
New high score!
Tickets.
Yeah.
Yay, tickets!
Baby Unicar, here I come!
Hey there, Mike’s Carcaders.
Last chance to exchange your tickets for a prize!
Baby Unicar is mine!
No. Mine.
Get ready!
Three, two, one, go!
Best banana I’ve ever had.
Banana peel!
-Enjoy your banana, Chrissy! -Oh no!
-Hey! -Energy boost!
Finished!
Hey, you two. What prizes can I get you today?
Baby Unicar!
Okay. I'm gonna go count these up.
-Yeah! -Yeah!
Okay, here come your prizes.
-What? -What?
-Pencils? -Pencils?
Sorry, guys. You only have 50 tickets each. Pencils are all you can get.
Maybe if you put your tickets together, you could share the Baby Unicar toy?
-Share? -Share?
Found you!
Found you!
Found you!
How'd you do that?
-Chrissy best hide-and-seeker. -She's pretty good.
We’ll see who’s the best.
Now it’s my turn to seek. I’m gonna find you all in no time.
Not Chrissy!
Chrissy, if I can’t find you, you can have cookies for dinner.
-Cookies! -Papa!
I mean…
-One, two… -Quick!
-Three, four, five… -Let's hide in here!
Oh, I know!
…eight, nine, ten.
Ready or not, here I come!
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Found you!
I thought you’d never find me here.
-Let’s find the others. -Okay.
-If we split up, we can cover more ground. -Good idea.
Daddy! Did you find anything?
Nothing so far.
Any luck?
-Nothing downstairs. -Let’s keep looking.
-Chrissy! -What was that?
-It came from the closet! -Oh no, they’re coming!
Found you.
Looks like they found us, Chrissy.
Chrissy? She was just here.
Looks like Chrissy’s better than you thought.
What? She just got lucky! We’ll find her.
Chrissy?
Chrissy?
Chrissy?
-Chrissy! -Chrissy!
-What? -Freddie, why are you in my house?
I’m playing hide-and-seek with Kimmy and Timmy. They’ll never find me here.
Well, good luck!
Chrissy!
-Chrissy! -Chrissy!
She's not here!
She’s nowhere!
-What do we do? -I don’t know where to look.
-What? -Was that her?
How is she doing this?
Just give up, Papa!
Okay, you win! Chrissy, you’re the best at hide-and-seek!
Chrissy best!
Cookie, please.
Chrissy scares me sometimes.
-Yeah. -Me too.
Yay!
Cannonball!
Chrissy?
Boo!
Splashy!
Cannonball!
Keep jumping like that and there won’t be any water left!
Time to head home, Chrissy. Say goodbye to Catalina.
One more!
Okay, just one more. I'm going to say goodbye to Cat's mum.
Okay.
-Cannonball! -Cannonball!
Cannonball!
No wheel?
No cannonball.
No cannonball?
Need…
wheels!
-Those kids love being in the water. -They certainly do.
Cannonball!
Cannonball!
Too slow.
Chrissy?
I…
Hello!
Oh, hello there, little boat.
Wait, a boat?
She went that way!
What?
Hi.
Chrissy!
-Nice circle! -How are we gonna make this triangle?
-Perfect! -Perfect!
-Can't stop. -Oh no!
What the…
A boat?! But…
My boat!
Oh no! My masterpiece!
Wait! No!
Hi, Cory.
No!
Cannonball!
Can we please have bannock for dinner?
Maybe when boats fly.
Hello.
-Cannonball! -Cannonball!
-All right, see you next week. -See you then.
Chrissy?
-Cannonball! -Cannonball!
Sweet dreams, Chrissy.
Oh, it's me!
Hi! I'm Honkin' Henry!
Chrissy, is that you?
What was that?
Oh well.
Float?
No float.
Now it just needs a really funny joke. Let's see what's on the internet.
-Procrastination is the key -Popcorn!
A great idea will come to me
Someone commented on my new profile pic!
Out of popcorn already?
I should take a power nap before lunch.
"You’re late again, Chrissy?"
Get off my bumper, Bobby. Are we doing it or not?
We need extra concrete to support the new structure.
Hold on, Julia, I need to take this call.
Hi, hun, it’s me Papa. Have you seen my snuggle socks?
Top drawer. Wait, are you about to take a nap?
I’m back. Let’s open the blueprints and take a look at the foundation.
-Hi, Chrissy. -Hi, Wilder.
Chrissy.
Bobby Mini Van.
One and a two and a three, four, five.
Yeah!
Nap time is over!
Time to roll!
Bye, Wilder!
Bye, Chrissy.
Chrissy.
Bobby Mini Van.
Okay.
Hi, sleepyhead.
-Did you have a good nap? -Yep!
Come sit with Mummy.
You’re getting so big. Don’t you grow up too fast, okay?
-Wait. Did you just wink at yourself? -Yep.
Almost finished.
I just need to draw a perfectly straight line.
Yes. Almost there.
Yes.
Oh, Chrissy. You scared me.
Do you have a case of the hiccups? I have just the thing. Drink some water.
I know. Let’s try this.
-Now take a drink of water. -What’s going on?
I’m just helping Chrissy cure her hiccups.
I have an idea.
My mum always gave me a spoonful of sugar to cure my hiccups.
-Sugar! -I don’t know if that’ll work.
Daddy, let’s try.
-I guess-- -Sugar!
Maybe it wasn't sugar. Salt? Maybe mustard?
Maybe it wasn't sugar. Salt? Maybe mustard? Not vinegar. Pickle juice didn't work.
Not vinegar. Pickle juice didn't work.
-Let’s try ground pepper. -Oh no. Did the fridge break again?
No, we’re just trying to get rid of Chrissy’s hiccups.
My mum has a neat trick for that. Hold your breath for ten seconds.
That was a neat trick.
Oh, Chrissy! Do you have the hiccups?
A good laugh always gets rid of them for me.
What do you call a sick train?
A-choo-choo train!
The best way to get rid of hiccups is by scaring them away.
Boo!
Did it work?
When I get the hiccups, I fly corkscrews through the air. That always helps.
We have an idea!
Spin 'em out!
They're gone!
Heat helps me.
Cold gets rid of mine.
Swinging gets rid of 'em.
Still nothing?
You just have to bounce them out.
Have you tried singing?
-My mum gave me a spoonful of sugar-- -Yes, we tried that.
This mask will definitely scare those hiccups out of Chrissy.
Now, where is she?
Hiccups gone!
They're gone?
I knew laughter would do the trick.
Look at me!
Don’t look at me.
Come and get your hot chocolate here!
What a nice day to go sledge… Oh, hot chocolate. Yummy!
Daddy!
-Sorry! -Sledging!
-Slow down, Chrissy. Wait for me. -Let’s go!
Okay!
Yikes!
People say the best part of sledging is actually the view.
Why don't we stay up here and get some hot chocolate?
They’ve got marshmallows! Yummy.
Thank you.
Wait! Chrissy!
Yeah!
Oh no!
Yeah!
Chrissy!
Chrissy! Wait. No!
Santa?
I think that’s my dad.
Your dad is Santa?
Pretty!
You know what? The best part of sledging really is the view.
My hot chocolate!
Finally. Open for business.
Hot chocolate!
Play time!
Sorry, Chrissy, I can’t. I have a lot of work to do.
Oh, maybe you can go play with Mama and Cory?
You get to draw two cards.
-Play time! -Chrissy!
-We’re actually in the middle of a game. -Yeah, ages five and up.
-Maybe you can play with Daddy? -Daddy no play time.
-Use this! -Remote?
It’s a super remote!
It lets you control someone like you control the TV. Watch. Hey, Cory!
Hey, is that super remote?
-We haven’t played that-- -Pause!
It’s just pretend.
But the rule is that you have to play along no matter what. Play!
Years.
I remember the fun we used to… Hey! Who put this banana in my card pile?
Have fun.
Nice job distracting her. You never do stuff like that to me, do you?
-Who wants nachos? -Me!
-Play time! -Chrissy, I said I-
-Super remote. -What! Who told you about--
Pause!
-Play. -Super remote?
Just don’t use it on me, okay?
Where did my pencil go?
Very funny, but I need to work. This comic is gonna take forever to finish.
Fast forward.
Done. Bye, Mr. Pencil! I’m hungry. Time for a snack!
Wait! Play time!
Hi, whatcha doing? Making nachos? None for me. Ketchup. Corn. Pan. No.
-Nothing like a cold glass of juice! -Pause.
-Play. -Oh, it’s spilled everywhere!
-You look like you’re having fun. -Mummy, play time!
I've got to get back to my game.
Rewind.
Looking for this?
Hey!
Pause!
Looks like I’m in control now.
-Play. Pause. Play. Pause. -Mummy, what are you doing?
We’re still playing! Daddy, do something!
Hey!
Come on, Chrissy. You’ve had your fun.
-Hand over the remote. -Volume down.
-Get her! -Pause!
Play.
Rewind.
Play.
Time to get back to work.
-Well, I guess no more super remote. -And no more play time.
Look, everyone! It's the saltshaker of madness!
If you get hit by the magic salt,
you turn into a monster!
Play time!
I’m going to eat you!
Time for tea, friends.
Cheers.
Stinky.
Nope.
No.
Stay here.
Okay, so I think we have all the resources we need.
-Chrissy! -Stinky.
You’re right. Something does stink.
I’ve got some work to do though. Do you think you can take care of it?
Aye aye, Mummy.
I'm back. Let's raid this dungeon!
Stinky.
Bye-bye, stinky!
Still stinky.
No stinky.
A little bit more…
Perfect!
Freddie, look. Our first customer!
Put the cap on!
Okay!
-Presenting… -The Rory Rubbish Truck Perfume.
Guaranteed to make you smell like the greatest rubbish truck in the world.
Well? What do you think?
Is that a no?
No more stinky.
Still stinky.
-I wouldn’t go in there if I were you. -What?
-I wouldn’t go in there if I were you. -What? It’s a real stinker. I don’t know who used the bathroom last,
It’s a real stinker. I don’t know who used the bathroom last,
but might just be best to, you know, let it air out.
Chrissy, no!
Okay, it was me!
Stinky! Chrissy! Open up!
Yeah! We need to use the bathroom!
You wanna go first?
No more stinky.
Still stinky.
No stinky.
No stinky.
No stinky.
Oh no!
Chrissy stinky.
Teatime!
Hey, Chrissy. I see you found the smell.
I knew you could do it.
Wait. What the… Where's the toilet?
Sorry, you lose again!
Take one on the house.
Yes! Jackpot! Come to mama!
-Welcome to the Lucky Lounge. -Here you go, boys.
Thank you, Miss Fenderson. Enjoy yourself.
This place is awesome!
-Only big ticket winners allowed. -Ticket.
You need way more tickets to party with the high rollers.
Better luck next time.
Too bad! Sorry! Too bad!
You lose!
Yeah!
No!
Chrissy not lucky.
Crispy! Combo! Awesome! Crispy! Combo! Perfect score!
Chrissy lucky?
Looks like you got a lucky penny. Hang on to it.
Lucky penny!
Yeah!
Big ticket!
Penny!
My tickets!
Come back!
Hey!
Thanks, Candace!
Wait!
What?
Is somebody there?
Wait! Penny!
No!
-Good luck fishing today, Squint. -Luck's got nothing to do with it.
I finally got the white whale!
Lucky penny!
Get back here, you!
Penny?
You won’t get away!
Ticket?
Penny no lucky! Chrissy lucky!
Not enough.
Bro, look.
Right this way, Miss Carson. Welcome to the Lucky Lounge!
Welcome to the 65th annual Bumper-Ball--
It's game time.
First, a quick word from our sponsor.
I'm gonna go upstairs and do some work.
-You're going to take a nap, aren't you? -What? No!
Morning, Mummy.
Morning. We're babysitting one of your friends today.
Yay!
Friend?
Hello, Chrissy Carson.
Bobby Mini Van.
I left a snack for you two on the table!
Fruit gummies!
Only one?
We've got the match of the century today!
The long-awaited showdown between two fated rivals.
The Mean Green Machines versus the Tin Can Vans!
Who will take the win? Who will come out on top?
Chrissy, look, ice cream!
Tin Can Vans have snatched the ball from the offence.
They head downfield. Look at that fancy wheel work.
Don't you dare!
They take aim.
And goal! It's a goal for the Tin Can Vans!
The Mean Greens are left in shock.
They don't get a second to celebrate.
Both teams scramble. I can barely see the ball! It's lost in the scuffle.
The Mean Greens have the ball.
We're off to the races! A beautiful manoeuvre.
Go, Mean Green! Show 'em who's boss!
This kid's a regular twinkle-tyres.
It's a goal for Green!
The Vans manage to break away! It looks like a clean… Oh!
Wait. What just happened?
A fan has come out onto the field and stolen the ball!
Can someone get stadium security, please?
Can no one get their tyres on that slippery subject?
Oh, they got him. The fan is down! They're really giving him a walloping!
Yay!
On with the game!
The match is heating up with no sign of slowing down.
I'm working!
They match point for point. The victory dances are nothing to sneeze at.
Oh yeah!
The wolves close in. Nowhere left to turn. Wait!
The wolves close in. Nowhere left to turn. Wait! A teammate is open, waiting in the wings like an angel.
Henry, catch!
A beautiful pass. And beautifully received.
I'm Honkin' Henry!
-Vamos, Mean Greens! -Vamos, Tin Cans!
¡Otro hermoso pase!
Thank you, Henry.
-Goal! -Goal!
It's all come down to this. One final goal will decide the match.
With seconds on the clock, who will take the championship title?
Another mad scramble. The play goes haywire.
Cars are sent head over wheels.
The ball is in the air. It's anyone's game.
Come on!
It's all over, folks! It's a tie!
A tie? Is that cherry?
Oh, look at you two having so much fun together.
How about some juice?
-Juice? -Juice?
There's only one left. I'll get some cups so we can split it.
We wouldn't leave you hanging! The match goes into overtime. Winner takes all!
Okay. This goes in here. And this--
Found me!
-Now Mummy hide. -Sorry, Chrissy.
Hop out of that box, please.
Chrissy!
Mummy, what's this?
We used to make home movies of you and Cory with this all the time.
Chrissy movies?
Probably.
-Watch Chrissy movie! -Right now?
Please!
-Well, we can watch one. -Yay!
That one.
Here we go! Hi, Chrissy. Say hi to the camera!
Hi!
Okay, that was fun. Now I need to get back to--
More Chrissy movies!
I just have so much to do.
Can you see the kids?
Yeah, there's Cory, walking down the hill. Hi, Cory! Where's Chrissy?
When you’re hunting a ghost, you have to be very quiet.
Boo!
Oh, Chrissy’s first restaurant!
And what would Madame like to order?
-Potty. -Pardon?
Honey, that's the potty face!
Oh no!
Mummy!
Okay.
What do puppy cars say?
Bark!
That's right! And what do puppy cars do?
Oh no! Not that!
Now I wonder, who could have made all of this mess?
Chrissy tornado!
Yep, that’s our Chrissy.
That’s still our Chrissy. I think that was all of them.
Back to work.
More movie!
Are you excited for Mama and Papa to get home, Cory?
Baby!
Yep, I’m excited too.
Baby Cory?
-Yeah! -Cory, let them through the door!
-Yeah! -Cory, let them through the door! -Let me grab your bags. -Thanks, Mum.
-Let me grab your bags. -Thanks, Mum.
I wanna see! Let me see!
Slow down, bud.
Baby!
Gentle.
Cory, meet your new baby sister, Chrissy.
Hi, Chrissy.
I’m gonna show her my toys!
These really are special times.
And they go by so fast.
Mummy go back to work now?
The weather looks fine.
Shouldn't we be outside searching?
Give us boats and we'll do the search ourselves.
Please, do not go near the ship.
Almost all of the bodies have been found.
The search is over.
Over?
Just like that?
Go kill yourself!
[man] Are we all just going home?
Be careful, Rita.
What about my granddaughter?
[crying] She can't stay outside.
Isn't there any other way?
I promise, we won't stop searching.
[woman 2] Why is the Coast Guard leaving?
Please include me in the 10:30 a.m. boat.
Of course, Mrs. Amado.
[in English] Leana, thank you.
[in Tagalog] You're welcome.
I'll take over from here.
-No, I can still do this. -No, you're very tired.
When was the last time you ate?
Why are you sad?
It's over.
Yes, it's over.
Everyone is leaving.
No one will ever come here.
Who else will come when that thing is still out there in the water?
Who will want to fish out there?
Money was already tight.
And now this.
-[sniffles] -Leana, maybe it's time to leave.
We're leaving?
It's sad here.
Rita should go to a proper school.
Just us?
One of the guests offered me a job in Manila.
You're leaving us?
I have a family. I need a job.
We're not leaving this place.
This is all we have left.
-Eddie! -What?
Where is Mrs. Amado?
-Why? Is anyone missing? -Just one.
Let them catch up, okay?
[Rita] Mrs. Amado!
Let's go, Mrs. Amado.
Mrs. Amado, it's time to leave.
[man] Leana.
Mr. Castro, your boat is leaving at 2:00.
We hope you keep this place open for one more month.
The Coast Guard has stopped the search.
It's over. They're leaving.
We will pay you.
Please keep this place open.
Open?
Open for what?
The current is strong under the Aurora.
It will get even stronger when the storm comes.
We think that...
there are still a lot of bodies trapped inside the ship.
There is a chance that the current will carry them here.
Are you asking me to wait for bodies to come ashore?
Fifty thousand for each body that you find.
I hope you didn't say yes.
Leana.
Don't give them hope. They are all grieving.
Let's not disturb the dead. Let them rest.
[Rita crying] Delia!
-We'll see each other again, Rita. -[sobbing]
Rita!
What do you plan to do with this place?
I'm not closing it yet.
Maybe another...
another month so...
so I can clean up.
I need to show you something.
This was what they looked like.
Crushed by metal.
-[screams echoing] -Squashed by cargo.
Drowned.
Even if you get out,
you have to swim in oil spills.
Flames.
I don't know why you're showing me these.
Because it's not your job to find them.
You're not going to find anyone.
If you're planning to look for help, let me remind you...
the ship is off-limits.
I have no plans.
It's sad here. There's nothing to do.
I miss Delia.
Don't worry.
We'll find fun things to do.
Okay.
Why don't you just teach me how to swim?
Before Father died, he said he'd teach me.
Can you teach me?
I don't know how to swim, so don't go near the water, okay?
That's not true!
I saw you swim before.
And you were so fast, like an elephant.
-Elephants can swim. -[laughs] Elephants?
And where'd you get that story? Are you making fun of me?
It's true! Eddie told me.
Well, that's not true. I don't know how to swim.
So promise me that you won't go near the water, okay?
Promise me!
-I won't! -You won't promise? [laughs]
-Elephants can swim! -No, they can't!
[faintly] I'm not an elephant!
-[Rita] You're an elephant! -You're not swimming!
-You're an elephant! -[Leana laughing] I'm not an elephant!
You're an elephant!
-How much? -[in English] Fifty.
Twenty-five...
Fifty! [in Tagalog] Here you go.
Ricky.
[exhales] Leana.
You're closing shop, too?
[Rita] I'm just gonna go there!
Don't go too far.
I'm done.
No one's buying my fishing gear anymore.
Uh, please, sit.
How are you?
[Ricky] How do you and Rita handle it?
You're so close to that ship.
We just stay inside.
Anyway, they're done.
The families have also left.
That's great!
[sighs] Even Delia left us. She's got a new job.
Philip's leaving, too.
He's a survivor.
The only one from here who was a passenger of the Aurora.
-He was there when it happened. -Philip, I didn't know.
How about you guys?
If you want, we can leave together.
Delia said the same thing, but...
we can't leave yet.
How much is this?
Uh, that's not for sale, but you can have it.
It's okay, I'll pay for it.
[Rita] Wake up, Leana!
They're back!
Wake up!
They've come back!
Wake up!
-Rita! -They're here!
They've come back!
Rita, throw that away.
No.
That will rot. It will stink.
No, it won't. It's already dry. Look.
Didn't I tell you not to go near the water?
I didn't go near the water.
Eddie...
I'm thinking of doing business with you.
Because you have your own boat.
You can go near the ship once every day.
I'll pay for your food and gas.
Fifty thousand for each body we find.
-Your wife... -Cecile.
If she wants, she can replace Delia here.
Take care of Rita
while I look for bodies that might wash ashore.
You can search the waters.
Are you not afraid?
They won't look like this anymore.
That's why I don't want Rita to see them.
So if you find one, bring it to the boatshed.
The Coast Guard forbids us from going near the ship.
That's why you can't tell anyone about this.
And never dive.
[Eddie] This is where I learned to swim and fish.
I know these waters better than the Coast Guard.
Okay. Fifty-fifty...
for each body.
This place is beautiful.
[Eddie] Of course!
We should be thankful to Leana.
The money will be a big help.
I told him it's dangerous.
[Cecile] Rita!
-Rita! -Rita, go back inside.
But I'm not gonna swim. I'm just here to watch Eddie.
No one goes out. End of discussion!
My goodness! There's nothing to do in this house.
Why can't you just listen to your sister? Go back inside.
Whew! That's exhausting!
There's nothing there.
I told you not to go near the rocks. It's dangerous out there.
That's not the problem. The problem is my gear. It's so old.
Okay, we'll try again tomorrow.
All right.
Rita...
sorry I was a bit cranky earlier.
There's just a lot on my mind these days.
It's very serious...
what we're doing.
It's okay.
I know that you're searching for dead bodies.
You're all right with that?
It's okay.
I also want them to go home.
We will do our best.
Okay.
We will find them.
They all want to go home.
They want to ride in Eddie's boat.
[Leana] Sure.
I doubt we'll find one today.
-Bye. -Why can't Eddie and Cecile
stay with us here?
We have enough rooms upstairs.
It's not that simple.
Why?
They have their own house.
And we don't really know them that well.
Mom and Dad wouldn't like that.
It doesn't matter what they think. They're dead.
Rita! Say sorry!
Rita!
Rita?
What's going on up there?
You're making a mess!
Where did you get Dad's shoes?
Rita!
I don't have time for games.
Why?
Why don't you just do as I say?
I'm closing off upstairs.
It's not being used anyway.
That's okay.
It was just the wind.
Is that Cecile?
She's with Rita.
A window broke last night. The wind was so strong.
I hope it gets even stronger so that ship will move.
Even just a little nudge will do.
Let's open this!
Wait, wake your sister up first.
Leana, wake up! Get up!
Leana, look at this.
[Eddie] See? There's a lot.
First, the flowers.
Now these.
The current really brings them back here from the Aurora.
I helped! Right, Eddie?
Oh, yeah! And you were so good!
-Rita helped out. -Didn't I tell you...
You were asleep and Cecile was upstairs.
I locked all the rooms upstairs. I can give you the keys so you can get in.
No need to. All the doors are open anyway.
Even the windows. It's a mess up there.
[Eddie] Next time,
I'll buy a bigger net and bigger hooks
so I can get more of these!
Ricky sells fishing gear. You can buy from him.
Sure.
I'll go to him. I'll also bring the rest of the cargo so we can sell it.
You're selling it?
Of course!
We'll sell it. That's money for us.
Are you selling everything?
Okay, not really everything. Go ahead and pick whatever you like.
Can I?
Please? Can I?
-Can I? -I'll choose for you.
Why can't I pick one for myself?
Because it's not yours.
You bought all that from selling the cargo?
Here. Fifty-fifty split, right?
Isn't that good?
Are you diving?
Why not? I know that ocean so well.
-What about those rocks--? -Everything! Even the rocks!
The undercurrent is so strong according to the Coast Guard.
What if you get swept away or pulled under?
Not today!
Wait, if you're not going to help me,
why don't you just babysit your sister?
Don't wait up.
What?
Go on. It's getting late.
See you later.
Wow! Eddie, I'm taking this one.
-What's that? -[in English] Noodles in a can.
[in Tagalog] There are noodles in cans?
-Eddie, you're teasing me! -[laughter]
Let's stop this.
Enough.
What?
We are not here to look for luggage or cargo.
We are getting paid to look for...
to look for missing passengers.
But this?
It's stealing.
I'm done.
I just...
I just want to find them because I made a promise. [inhales]
These things were floating in the ocean.
I just picked up some blessings.
-What do you want me to do? -This isn't ours!
We're taking advantage of the dead!
[sighs] Leana, the money we earned was all used for the search!
It was used to buy equipment and food!
So we can go on with this!
I'm sure the families want us to go on searching--
I want the search to continue
because I promised!
But I don't want to take from the dead.
Fine, if you don't want to.
You're perfect!
I'm a thief. I have no problem with that. If you don't want these, I'll take it all.
And everything else that I'm gonna get from that ship!
Eddie. Eddie!
-Eddie! Eddie! -[door opens]
Leana...
Ricky?
[man] Where is Leana?
[woman] Leana!
[man] With Ricky again? Grab the keys!
[woman] Let's go! Hurry up!
What do you think, Ricky?
I don't care about the money. You can have it.
I have some savings left.
I just really need your help.
-But isn't this Eddie's job? -Mine.
It's my job.
I was the one who had a deal with the families.
This is something else, Leana.
I have to admit, I am scared.
Always.
But wouldn't it be better if we find all the missing?
So this will all end.
My God.
I'll call the family.
Which family?
Anyone.
No, no, no! Let's call the Coast Guard.
-No! Don't. -[Ricky] What do you mean, "No"?
-I was the one who found the dead body. -Idiot! The dead body found you!
Oh, so I was found by that body? And how about you?
You did nothing. You didn't even go into the water.
You are such an idiot!
If I hadn't pulled you, there'd be two of you lying dead inside!
Stop it, you two!
I'll take care of this.
I'll find out who he is without causing trouble.
No one should know we're searching for bodies.
He stays here.
Rita should never see this.
Fifty thousand.
If we split that three ways, how much will each of us get?
You both can have the money.
Rita?
Rita.
-Why did you sleep here? -Hi, Leana.
I can't remember.
Get up now and take a bath.
Hello?
-[in English] Mrs. Castro? -[in Tagalog] Did you find Melencia?
Uh, not yet, but we found a man.
Was there anyone who...
I don't know how old he is.
We can ask the other families.
Who can this one be?
What we know is that there were many...
who were not on the ship's manifest.
-Stowaways? -No, not stowaways.
They paid and had tickets but weren't official.
I don't understand.
We think the Aurora was overloaded.
As long as there's money to pay, anyone can get on board.
It's a business.
Many shipping companies do it.
Is that legal?
Everyone is involved.
From the ship owners to...
maybe even the captain.
-Eddie, there's someone by the window. -Hmm?
-There's someone inside. -What?
-What's wrong? -I don't like it!
-I don't want to go there. -What?
I don't want to go in there! I don't like it! Take me back home!
-Wait! What's wrong with you? -Take me back home!
-Take me home! -Okay! Stop it!
-All right! All right! -Take me home!
[in English] "God sent the fish to save Jonah.
Jonah stayed inside the belly of the fish
for three days and three nights."
[in Tagalog] Oh, Rita, your hands are so cold.
I want to go inside now.
Now you want to go back inside.
-I still have so many things to do. -Like what?
Rita.
Do you want to go to the mainland?
I have a few things to do at the municipal office.
-I'll buy you a new dress. -Really?
Yeah, right.
Can I help you?
Rita, can you stay there for a while?
Is that for classified ads? Are you selling a house on the island?
Uh... no.
I'm looking for someone.
Missing persons. From the Aurora?
Candy, can you hand me the missing persons file?
[Candy] Hold on.
Here.
Maybe in here?
[woman] Try looking at these files.
Everyone here is missing?
The numbers went up after the Aurora tragedy.
But not all of them are from here.
We also get reports from other towns.
Found anyone?
The one we got--
Um, it's okay. I'm not really too sure.
Okay, why don't you...
leave your name, address, and your phone number?
It's okay. Never mind.
Thank you.
Rita, let's go.
Let's go home.
Leana!
[man] Pay first before looking!
No photos!
Rita.
Yes?
-Where are you going? -Just upstairs.
Don't go inside 2A, okay?
Rita?
Rita, are you really not listening to me?
-[hammer clatters] -[sighs] Rita.
[Rita] I know who you are!
Your name is Benjamin.
And you are famous!
You're in the newspaper.
I'll read it for you.
"The famous seven-footer..."
[in English] "'Boy Giant,' Benjamin David,"
[in Tagalog] "died of heart complications at the age of 28.
Benjamin had a genetic disorder called 'gigantism.'
A victim of constant bullying,
he ran away from his hometown when he was still a teenager.
His father will bring his remains home
via the passenger ship Aurora."
[man 1 whispers] It really is true. He's a giant.
[man 2] Hey! Not too close. No photos!
Just look, don't take photos. Hey! That's enough!
Good thing we found you.
-Now you can finally go home. -[eerie music playing]
We will take you home.
I don't want to go home.
I'll never go home.
[Rita] Leana! Our guests are hungry.
What should we feed them?
Leana! Our guests are hungry.
What should we feed them?
Philip.
I just wanted to know...
what really happened to the Aurora?
When are you leaving?
I'll come with you.
[Philip] We were packed like sardines on that ship.
There were too many passengers.
It was chaotic.
I even had a hard time standing up.
The Aurora was overloaded!
And then the ship smashed into the rocks, like this!
Do you know anyone who died?
A man who died on the ship?
Many people died.
But maybe you will remember this one.
He was tall, uh, like a giant.
How did you know about that?
There was a dead body aboard the ship.
He was like a giant.
The ship's crew was saying it was bad luck.
But a lot of passengers and crew still came to see him.
All the strange things that happened on the ship,
they blamed it on the dead man.
Blackouts.
Temperatures dropping very low.
They said it was because of him.
The crew said that the dead man didn't want to go home.
But some said that they saw him around the ship.
They're just stories the crew made up to scare the kids,
to keep them from being rowdy.
No one knows.
I don't know!
[in English] Human error.
Suicide.
[sniffles] All I know is that...
the last thing I saw was Leana's seaside inn.
It seemed so near.
-[crashing] -[people screaming]
[Philip] I jumped.
A lot of people did.
I thought it'd be easy to swim.
[sobs] But the sea was on fire.
[Philip] I thought I saw the giant,
the dead man...
on the bridge...
with the captain.
Leana...
I feel so cold.
[Leana] Let's get out.
Are you okay?
When the water rises, take a deep breath.
-Hold it as long as you can. -Like this? [inhales]
And never leave my side, okay?
-[boy] Mama. -[woman] Shh.
[woman] We're just near the shore.
Do you see that big house over there?
[captain in English over PA] This is your captain speaking.
[captain in Tagalog] We have a minor engine problem.
[captain over PA] Wait for further instructions.
[captain in English over PA] This is your captain speaking.
[captain in Tagalog] We have a minor engine problem.
Please stay where you are and put on your life jackets.
Wait for further instructions.
[woman] My child's missing!
[captain in English over PA] This is your captain speaking.
[captain in Tagalog] We have a minor engine problem.
Please stay where you are and put on your life jackets.
[captain in English over PA] This is your captain speaking.
[captain in Tagalog] We have a minor engine problem.
Please stay where you are and put on your life jackets.
Wait for further instructions.
-Where are we? -Hold tight.
[Rita in English] One...
two...
three...
four...
five...
six...
seven...
...25, 26, 27,
28, 29, 30...
-Forty... -[Leana in Tagalog] Ma'am, they're here.
-Fifty... -[Mrs. Amado] Leana?
-Melencia... I saw them. -[Rita continues counting]
[Mrs. Amado] Where is she?
-Leana? -[Rita whimpers]
Please call the Coast Guard.
Please call the families. They are all back.
-All of the missing. -Leana!
They've returned.
Leana! Leana!
[Rita] Leana!
-Rita! -Leana!
-Rita! -[people screaming]
-Rita! -Leana!
-Leana! -Rita!
Rita!
-Rita! -Leana!
Rita!
Rita!
Rita!
Leana! Leana!
Leana! Leana!
Leana! Leana! Leana!
Leana! Leana! Leana!
Look. The Aurora is gone.
There were still many more of them.
So crowded.
[voice breaking] They were screaming, crying for help, but nobody came.
-What? -Some were in the cargo hold.
There were children and babies.
They were trapped. The crew forgot about them.
Leana, how do you know this?
What happened here?
[in English] Mrs. Castro...
[in Tagalog] there were still so many dead on the ship.
And you knew all about it.
That's why you didn't want us to go near the ship.
She's gone mad.
I already warned you, didn't I?
That a storm was coming.
Aurora was overloaded.
So many people weren't listed on the manifest.
-Are you saying I'm a part of it? -Yes.
You, including the captain.
Leana.
I saw them, too.
Where are they?
They're all inside.
I'm sorry, Leana, but I don't know what you're talking about.
[Mrs. Amado] They're inside. Come on, let's go.
[woman] They're in here.
Why?
Wake up!
It's over.
Leana...
Thank you.
I'll go in and help.
Go home.
Leana?
What did you say?
-[man] Be right back. -Okay.
Travis?
[in singsong] Oh, Travis.
Travis?
[woman] Oh, there you are.
I like the way you think.
This is Ellie.
The opposing council said what?
Well, that's ridiculous.
He infringed on not one but four of our clients' patents,
and they're filing for validity?
Are you kidding me? [laughs, scoffs]
They may as well cut the check now.
Yes.
I understand what you're saying,
but time is of the essence.
Well, I'm actually back in Oceancrest.
Marcus and I are still unpacking.
Yes, it's very exciting.
He's doing well, much better. Thanks for asking.
Yeah. I think we're all set. I will be in the office...
Yeah. I think we're all set. I will be in the office... first thing in the morning, and we know what to do.
first thing in the morning, and we know what to do.
Yes, that sounds perfect.
Okay. Yeah, I'll speak with you in the morning. Bye-bye.
Marcus, I'm here.
Honey?
[sighs] So much for waiting.
Yeah, sorry. It just showed up this morning, so I threw it together.
[Marcus] It's not much, but it's starting to feel like home.
I remember when Brit won this at the fair.
I miss her.
Well, look, Berkeley's only an hour away.
Okay? She'll be home for fall break before you know it.
Yeah.
This is a big lifestyle change, you know.
Do you think it was a mistake leaving the city?
No, I don't think it was a mistake. I mean, we came right out of college
No, I don't think it was a mistake. I mean, we came right out of college to having Brittany, and...
busy career, so...
it's our time.
-You're stuck with me. -Stuck with you?
Once, of course, your case is over, that is.
Ellie Warren.
[Ellie] Hey!
[woman] Ellie!
I'm so late.
Freeway was a parking lot.
Oh, I just figured you guys had a late night, first night in the house.
Well, the house is new, -but the man is not. -Ah.
-How about happy hour tonight? -Can't.
I am dying to get my flirt on, and I need my wing woman.
-I know, but Marcus is cooking. -You see, -that is exactly what I need. -[chuckles]
[sighs] So, tomorrow, then?
We'll get drunk and bitch about our respective firms.
Do you know how crazy traffic is gonna be on a Friday night?
Yeah, it's gonna be a nightmare. It's always a nightmare. Get over it.
I won't take no for an answer.
Bye.
Good morning.
Good morning.
This is our lead counsel, Ellie Warren,
who I am hoping we can all persuade to reconsider
and stay at the firm after this is closed.
This is the tech consultant I was telling you about, David Hammond.
Ellie.
David, hi.
-How you doin'? -I'm good.
You two know each other?
Yeah, we, uh... we actually went to college together.
-Yeah. -It's been a long time, huh?
It sure has. Twenty years.
-[laughs] -You look like it's been 20 minutes.
Well...
Okay, as I was telling David,
our client alleges that the patents belonging to Mr. Moore, the defendant,
infringe on four of our client's provisionals.
In addition to that,
Mr. Moore seems to be in possession of certain proprietary information
that he could only have gotten from our client's patent counsel.
-Ellie, your thoughts? -Thank you.
It appears that Mr. Moore's nephew was working as a clerk at that time,
which means he would have had easy access to confidential information.
You do realize that any relevant communications
You do realize that any relevant communications I acquire from the defendant and his nephew will be inadmissible.
I acquire from the defendant and his nephew will be inadmissible.
You just find those e-mails and let me worry about how to handle him.
Oh, I'll find them.
They warned me your boss was a shark.
Maybe next time, you should bring a cage.
-[both chuckling] -I can't get over how great you look.
-Thank you. -Wait, hold on.
-Oh. -There.
[chuckles] Thanks.
Well, I have another meeting to run to, but, um, we should catch up.
Yeah, I would like that.
How about tonight?
Actually, tonight, I would have to take a rain check.
Not gonna make me wait another 20 years, are you?
Um, no, that, I will not do.
Here's my card. Call me anytime.
I'm gonna hold you to that.
-It was really good to see you, Ellie. -Welcome to the team.
I'll do some shopping this week.
Maybe fire up the grill over the weekend.
Sounds good.
The wine is great.
Thank you.
Yeah, you know, I think this firm is gonna be... a really good fit for me.
They let me take over a project from another architect, so it'll be...
good to get back on the horse, as they say.
Well, that's amazing.
Just make sure you take your time because you're still in recovery.
Have a seat. Your friend's a miracle worker.
Already, he has uncovered damaging correspondence from Mr. Moore.
All of that in a day, huh?
Actually, it only took a few hours, but I wanted to bring it to you in person.
-Oh. -[woman] Look at this.
So, do you think they'll settle?
If we play our cards right.
-This calls for celebration. -Yeah.
Drinks tonight?
I can't.
-Again. -Uh, no, I promised my girlfriend Courtney I'd meet her for happy hour.
I promised my girlfriend Courtney I'd meet her for happy hour.
Oh, girls' night. I get it.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
But you know what?
-You should actually come with us. -No, I couldn't impose.
David, you should. It'll be fine. She will not mind.
-You sure? -Yes.
Where?
Uh, Nolan's. Seven o'clock?
-It's a date. -Good.
Nice work today.
-Thank you. -See ya.
Bye-bye.
Hey, where are you? I'm here.
Okay, look, don't kill me,
but I have to finish this brief before I leave.
We go to trial next week.
Courtney, are you serious?
I promise I'll make it up to you.
I understand. Um, well, I guess I'll see you later, then.
All right, see you soon. Bye.
Hey, Ellie.
David, hey.
Everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine.
I have a booth in the back for us. Um, is your friend...
Oh, Courtney, no. That was actually just her.
She's stuck at the office, and she won't be able to make it.
I guess I have you all to myself then. [chuckles]
-[Ellie] Just a little. -Okay. Wow.
You're many things, Ellie Brooks, but I've never known you to be a woman who couldn't keep up.
It's "Warren."
Right, right. Mrs. Warren.
Yes.
So what's this about Janice saying you're leaving the firm?
Oh, so, uh, my husband and I, we just bought a new house in Oceancrest.
And, uh, as soon as I finish this case, I'm gonna start my own practice.
-Wow. -[Ellie] Yeah.
Living the dream.
It's exciting. And my daughter, she just started her first year in college,
so it feels like a good time to go.
-No way you have a daughter in college. -I absolutely have a daughter in college.
Wanna see?
There she is.
[David] Wow.
She's beautiful.
Thank you.
Has your eyes.
Yeah, that's my girl.
So, uh...
So what about you?
Wife? Girlfriend? Children? What's your story?
Divorced, no kids.
Um, I guess we all can't be as lucky as you are.
Unless there's trouble in paradise?
No trouble.
I do.
I do have the perfect life, the perfect husband, the perfect daughter,
the perfect home.
But, you know, one day, you wake up 20 years later,
and you realize the person sleeping next to you
feels like a complete stranger.
-Hmm. -[Ellie] I don't know how that happens.
Twenty years is a long time.
But I'm pretty sure he's still attracted to you.
I don't know.
But look, I don't wanna dump all my drama on you.
No. No, we're just catching up.
Okay.
Janice?
Uh, Marcus.
Ah, Mr. Warren.
Yes.
If you have to leave, I totally understand.
Oh, no.
I'm good.
-Another bottle of wine, then. -Um...
If we stay here drinking, people are gonna start talking.
-[sighing] -Where would you like to go?
I don't know.
Twenty years ago?
So, tell me, how come you and I never dated?
Well, probably because you were too busy dating those other guys.
-Maybe I was just waiting for you to ask. -Maybe I didn't wanna get my heart broken.
Well, maybe we were just preserving the friendship.
I'll drink to that.
To friendship.
You're a bad influence.
But let's say, uh... What if I had asked you out?
Would you?
Well,
I don't know that I remember you looking this good back then.
I got a confession to make.
Please.
I knew you worked with the firm before I took the job.
-Really? -Yeah.
Janice inquired about my services. I found out you worked there.
I figured it'd be fun for us to catch up, -work together, you know. -[chuckles]
-I hope you don't mind. -No, no. Not at all.
I gotta tell you,
if things had worked out differently...
you would never feel like you're sleeping with a stranger.
If only.
Do you trust me?
Uh, no, I don't trust you.
Come on.
Ellie...
No.
No, David. I can't.
I can't. I'm sorry. I have to go.
-[David] Ellie! -[breathing heavily]
Ellie.
I gotta go home, David.
To the complete stranger sleeping in your bed?
-I never should have said that. -Listen,
you deserve to be with a man who appreciates you.
I needed tonight, but that should have never happened.
My car is here. Good night, David.
Hey, babe.
-Didn't hear you come in. -Hey.
Thank you.
This is amazing.
It's exactly what I was looking for.
So, David,
as I recall, the last time you were here, you weren't doing so well.
Yeah, I know, doc.
But the good news is I'm fine now.
-Really? -[David] Yeah.
Work is good.
I'm sleeping again, going to the gym.
-I've even started seeing someone. -There it is.
[chuckles] Yeah. She's a lawyer.
-Is she? -Yeah.
Uh, the thing is, she's just getting out of a long-term relationship,
so we're gonna take things slow. Give her some space, you know?
David, do you remember when you first came to see me
David, do you remember when you first came to see me for your court-ordered anger management?
You told me how broken you were over Deborah.
Yeah.
[doctor] Do you still feel that way?
Why do you keep bringing that up? I...
I told you I was over it now.
Because, after what you've been through,
I don't think anyone would blame you if you were still having problems.
Hello?
Mom? Dad?
Wow. [chuckles]
Wow.
There she is.
[chuckles] Dad, where did you find this?
I keep all your old stuff, baby. Welcome to your new home.
Thank you, Dad.
I've been looking forward to this fall break.
Aw, we missed you.
-Oh, missed you, too. -We missed you so much.
So, what do you think?
Uh, it's pink.
-Uh-oh, she doesn't like it. -She doesn't.
Well, we can change whatever you don't like.
We just wanted you to have something special to walk into.
Aw, thank you.
But wait, did you see the private beach though?
-'Cause that might fix everything. -Oh, I think it might. Yeah.
-Come on. Let's go see. Come on. -Okay, let's go.
[Ellie] Hey, sweetie.
Mom!
So, what do you think?
You did it.
-[Ellie chuckles] -New job. New house.
Dad's smiling again.
Now I can breathe.
Come on, admit it. You miss the city.
[chuckles] I don't know.
Eh, mark my words.
You'll get sick of writing wills for rich old ladies, and you'll be back.
-[chuckles] -You'll be back. They always come back.
-See you later. -Bye. Mwah.
-Bye. -Yeah, bye.
One second.
[David] Ellie?
[Ellie] David.
-Hey. -Wow.
I just left a meeting across the street,
and I thought to myself, she looks like Ellie.
You look great.
Thank you.
Look, I'm just gonna come right out and say it.
About that night,
I apologize.
No, it's... it's totally fine. You don't need to apologize.
It was late. We both had too much to drink. It should've never happened.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I thought you might be angry or something. -You know? -Why?
Why would I be angry? I'm... I'm fine.
Well, you haven't returned my phone calls.
[David] Hold on a minute.
Sorry, sir.
How about we grab a coffee and talk? My treat.
I... I, um... I actually just had a coffee,
-but thanks. -Okay, just talk then?
I've got an hour before my next meeting, and I wanna hear all about your new firm.
I can't, David. I am married.
It's not okay.
-[horn honks] -I said wait a goddamn minute.
[man] Hey, are you moving or not?
I get it.
But things don't have to be awkward between us.
I just want you to know...
I'm here for you.
I appreciate that, David.
Take care.
Shit!
Hey, baby.
Hi! I didn't even hear you come in. -What happened? You all right? -Oh, I just cut my finger.
-What happened? You all right? -Oh, I just cut my finger.
Does it hurt?
A little bit.
How about that? Better?
Maybe.
-That's better. -That's better.
Thank you. Wait, wait, you know what? It's been a really long day. I think I... I need more.
[woman] You have a visitor.
Hi.
Hi.
What a nice surprise.
-Thank you. -Mm, mm, mm.
You're welcome. Wow! Looks like you're getting settled.
I'm trying. We're almost there.
Wow, this looks really good on you.
I've never seen you look so relaxed at work.
It's amazing how effective I can be at my job
when there aren't millions of dollars at stake.
How's that? Sweet enough?
It's okay.
Okay?
-[chuckles] -Madam, I will have you know that that...
is the nectar of the gods.
What do you say we take this desk for a spin?
-Uh, that's not a bad idea. -[clears throat] Uh, the notary's here.
-Oh! Sorry. -To be continued.
To be continued.
I'm so sorry about that, sir.
Uh, honey, don't forget we have dinner tonight.
Courtney's coming over, Brittany's on a date,
so it'll probably just be the three of us.
Steak or salmon?
Salmon.
[Marcus] Done.
-You must be here for my daughter. -Yeah. Scott, sir.
Marcus Warren, FBI.
Sir?
Dad, you remember Scott? We went to high school together.
Hey, Scott.
Hey, Mrs. Warren.
-How you doing? -Good. Thank you.
-Good. Where you guys headed? -Dinner and a movie.
Nice.
So, be home at 11:00?
Mom, I'm in college. I'll be home by 12:00.
11:00.
How about 12:00?
Have fun, baby.
Thanks. Love you.
Love you.
Bye.
Bye.
[Marcus] I don't get a hug?
[Marcus] See, it's starting already.
Honey, I feel like maybe we should've ordered in.
-I feel like I'm so behind. -No, no, this is perfect.
Table's set for three. We're good.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
-Okay. -[doorbell rings]
-She's here. -I got it.
Hey, man. Marcus.
-Welcome to our humble abode! -[Courtney] Wow!
Beautiful. I hope you don't mind the last-minute plus-one.
-[Marcus] No! Not at all. -Hey! Oh, you look beautiful.
-How are you doing? You look gorgeous! -Hi.
Hi, I'm David. Nice to meet you.
Ellie.
Uh, before I forget. I figured white goes with everything.
Oh, yeah, man. Thank you. I like this guy already.
Oh, yeah, man. Thank you. I like this guy already. -[Marcus] Look at that, babe. -[Courtney chuckles]
-You guys want a tour? -Yeah, that'd be great.
Oh, yeah, come on. Out here.
-This is what sold it, so... -[Courtney] Whoa.
...I'll show you that first.
[Marcus] I'll show you the... main attraction here.
Watch yourself.
[David] Wow.
[chuckles] So, David, listen, you gotta tell me. I'm familiar with tech consultant,
but what's your lane? What's your specialty?
Actually, I'm a hacker.
Babe! He's consulted with some of the biggest firms in the city.
Yeah, I'm the guy you hire when you need information that doesn't wanna be found.
Aha! Well, it's legal though, right?
It's "unofficial."
I'm surprised your old firm never hired him.
-Yeah. -How'd you two meet?
-You wanna tell them, or... -No, no, you...
-Okay. -You tell them.
Okay. So, I'm waiting for the elevator one day,
[volume lowers] and up walks this very handsome, -[creepy music plays] -very confident man, and suddenly...
it was like everyone else in the lobby just disappeared.
I think I even heard music.
Ah, so I introduced myself and--
Yeah, and I was so captivated by her,
I asked her out for lunch that afternoon. Here we are.
Turns out, he'd just gone through a bad divorce.
What happened?
What's there to say?
I had the perfect home, perfect wife.
One day, you wake up, and it feels like the person you've been sleeping next to
One day, you wake up, and it feels like the person you've been sleeping next to for 20 years is a complete stranger.
for 20 years is a complete stranger.
[Marcus] Wow.
That's gotta suck.
Yeah.
-Babe, you don't have to talk about it-- -No, it's okay. It's okay.
I mean, what hurt the most was,
no matter how much time and effort I put in...
she didn't take me seriously.
Well, hey, onward and upward, right?
Another toast. To new friends and happy relationships.
-Cheers. -Cheers!
Anyone up for dessert?
-[David] Yeah. Yeah, sure. -Yeah.
-Courtney, wanna come with me? -Yeah.
-No, no, it's okay, baby. I'll get it. -You sure?
-Yeah. -Okay.
This guy.
Are you crazy?
How dare you show up at my house.
You don't return my calls. You don't return my texts.
-How else am I supposed to reach you? -You're not supposed to.
You don't have to worry.
Our secret is safe.
My husband...
My husband is outside.
Do you not see what I'm willing to do for you?
Don't you touch me.
-This could work. -I don't know what you think this is,
but I want you to go outside right now
and come up with an excuse as to why you need to leave early.
And I don't ever wanna see you around me,
my daughter, my husband, or my home ever again.
Do you understand?
Just got off the phone with a client.
The file I was working with got corrupted, so, uh... and they need it tonight.
So I gotta go.
-Oh! Mm-hmm. -Courtney, I can take you home.
No. No, that's okay. I don't want you to have to drive all the way back by yourself. That's... It's fine.
all the way back by yourself. That's... It's fine.
-Call me. -Yeah.
-What's wrong? Everything okay? -No, I'm fine.
[over recording] Hi, you've reached Courtney. Leave a message.
Courtney, it's Ellie, and I need you to call me back.
I've left you so many messages. I need to talk to you.
Hey, Mom. What's this?
-Call me back. -Oh! "Forget Me Nots."
-I remember this song. -[chuckles]
Where did you get this?
Uh, I actually found it in a box in the garage.
Oh, this could be worth some real money. If you don't want it, I'll take it.
-I'll keep it. -Okay.
-Hey. -Don't!
I know you're upset.
You seduce my friend? You show up at my house?
You've crossed the line, David.
I get it. I get it.
You wanna be discreet.
-No one has to know about us. -Us? There is no us!
Would your husband think that?
If you even think about calling my husband--
I'm not saying that I would, but I could.
Come on, Ellie.
Tell me that night didn't unlock something inside of you.
I mean, look at you.
We did it!
You know what? I've tried to be considerate of your feelings
and respectful of our friendship,
but what is it gonna take?
-For what? -For you to stay away from me, my family, and Courtney.
And make the same mistake we made 20 years ago?
David, the only mistake I made was getting caught up in the moment that night.
I am warning you, David. You've gotta stay the hell--
Who do you think you're talking to, Deborah?
Who the hell is Deborah?
David?
David.
Look.
Okay, listen.
I know that we have had some amazing memories in the past,
and I am just asking you to please...
let's leave the past where it is.
This has got to stop.
I need you to leave me alone.
Hey.
Hey.
What's wrong?
He told me everything on the way home.
So you basically just let me sit through that whole dinner and make a fool out of myself.
Courtney, that is not true. I tried to tell you.
Tell me what?
David is unstable.
Oh, he's unstable?
You come on to him in the middle of a nightclub,
rip his clothes off in the bathroom, but he's unstable?
You then invite him to lunch,
scream at him in front of the entire restaurant,
-but he's unstable? -No, wait. I'm sorry. Wait a minute, wait a minute. What exactly did he tell you?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What exactly did he tell you?
The truth.
How you wanted to have an affair ever since Janice hired him,
but he turned you down.
How you've been trying to seduce him... ever since you found out I was seeing him.
No, that is not true.
You know me better than anyone. I would never do that to you.
Really? You wouldn't do that to me?
Explain that.
Wait a minute, no.
He sent these messages to me.
He must have just switched the names. [stammering] I didn't do that.
You know, he didn't even wanna show them to me
because he knows what these would do to your marriage if they ever got out.
And you believe him.
You actually believe the guy... who sat with us at dinner and told us both that he was a hacker.
who sat with us at dinner and told us both that he was a hacker.
If he wanted you to know so badly that he and I were having an affair,
why do you think he waited so long to tell you?
Because apparently, he's the only one who cares about your marriage.
I really don't know why I bothered to even come down here.
-Wait. -Oh, my God. I'm... I'm just gonna go.
-Courtney! -No. No.
Thanks for your complete honesty.
-Really nice, Ellie. Really nice. -Wait, Courtney.
Listen to me.
Are you telling me, right now, that you really believe that there's nothing wrong?
Oh, I definitely believe there's something wrong here.
Courtney, you're being ridiculous. I would not lie to you.
Courtney.
Courtney!
Linda, if anyone calls, I'm heading into the city for a few hours.
Uh, okay.
But I need those papers on my desk by Friday at 2:00 p.m., Desiree.
-Oh, Ellie! Hi! -Hi.
How are you?
-It's so good to see you. -You too.
Professor Nicole.
I don't know that I'm ever gonna be able to get past that.
Oh, God. I can't believe how good you look!
What are you, hiding one of those portraits in the attic?
-What's your secret? -I left the city.
Yeah, that'll do it.
Uh, Brittany told me about Marcus. He's getting better?
Yeah, he's doing good. Slowly but surely.
-Thanks for asking. -God, it's so funny you call.
I was just going through old photos for the retrospective.
-Really? -Yeah. What brings you up this way?
Uh, David Hammond.
What about him?
A friend of mine is, uh, looking for a consultant,
and I knew you were friends. And I was just wondering what you thought of him.
I mean, I don't remember much.
Just that he was smart, kinda quiet though.
Then, of course, that he was totally obsessed with you.
He was?
Yeah, come on. Wait, you didn't notice?
-[stammers] No, actually. No. -[chuckles]
Oh! That's right.
Because you only had eyes for Marcus,
all hot and sweaty in his Stanford uniform.
Well, yeah, that I remember.
[chuckles] But you must remember David's ex-wife, Deborah, right?
No. I don't... I don't know that I've... I've met Deborah.
Really? She looked just like you.
-Really? -Yeah.
So, why did they get a divorce?
I... [sighs] I mean, look, David was a nice guy, you know.
Handsome, accomplished.
But off the record...
Deborah told me he had a crazy temper.
And he was super controlling and just crazy jealous.
Wish... I wish I could hear her side of the story.
Ellie, she's dead.
What?
A couple months after the divorce,
someone broke into her new boyfriend's place,
killed them both.
Oh, my God.
Was David ever considered a suspect?
Oh, yeah, they investigated him, of course.
But, I mean, at the end of the day, the police decided it was just a robbery.
Apparently, the new boyfriend was a dealer,
had a bunch of cash lying around the house.
Ellie, what's this really about?
Oh, my God.
Courtney, hi, it's Ellie. Please call me when you get this message.
I have some information I think you need to know. [breathes deeply]
Call me on my cell. I'll be in the office as well.
All right. Bye. Love you.
Come in. -Hey, Mom. -Hey, sweetie.
-Hey, Mom. -Hey, sweetie.
You're up early.
-Yeah, Scott's coming over. -Oh, okay.
-Is everything okay? -Um, yeah.
You know what?
Give me a hug.
Why? [chuckles]
[sighs] I need it.
-Morning. -[Linda] Morning!
-Any messages? -[Linda] Your 10:30 confirmed.
Okay. If Courtney calls, pull me from whatever I'm doing.
[Linda] Oh, no problem.
And if this guy shows up, call the police.
Sure.
[Marcus] So the good news is I'm finally starting to get
[Marcus] So the good news is I'm finally starting to get some clients of my own instead of just proofing.
[Brittany] Hmm, that's great, Dad.
[Marcus] Yeah. You remember that job I did in Palo Alto?
Babe?
[Brittany] Mom?
-You remember the job I did in Palo Alto? -Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.
Well, it turns out that guy bought some land here
and wants me to design a building for him.
That's amazing, honey.
Yeah. Looks like things might be finally turning around.
Everything okay, Mom?
Yeah, no. I'm, uh...
Oh, I'll get it.
No, no. I got it.
-You okay? -Yeah, no, I'm fine. Um...
I need to call my office. Be right back.
[David] Hey.
How did you get it?
[David] Ellie, if I can break into one of the top e-mail service providers in the country for you,
I can definitely hack into a nightclub for me.
You give me one reason why I shouldn't call the police and get a restraining order.
Well, I wonder what would happen if I sent that video to Marcus.
I wonder what would happen if the world knew what really happened to your ex-wife.
I'm not giving up on us, Ellie.
David?
David.
Shit.
[over recording] Hi! You've reached Courtney. Leave a message.
-[beeps] -Courtney. It's Ellie.
Please call me as soon as you get this message. I need to talk to you.
So how was your day?
It was great.
Oh, you're so sweet. Babe.
What is it?
Oh, sexy.
Sure you wouldn't rather see me in less?
It's no rush.
Okay.
I guess I'll see you in a minute.
What do you think?
Beautiful.
-[David] You did all this time, tell me. -[moaning] I love you.
Yeah, I want you.
I'm yours.
Don't go.
I'm gonna miss you.
Yeah.
Promise.
Okay. See you later.
-Call me. -I will.
Hey, David.
[David] Hey. Hope you weren't waiting long.
[Marcus] Hey. No, man. Not at all.
Gotta tell you, I was surprised when I got your call this morning, man.
I never thought I'd get a chance to play this course. It's amazing.
[David] You're gonna love it.
[Marcus] There it is.
[David] Good one.
[Marcus] Thanks, man.
Tell you, it's the putter.
Thing damn near putts itself.
Elle got it for me for my birthday last year.
She really seems like a great woman.
I'd love to hear your secret.
Well, I'll tell you. A marriage counselor once told us
that you have to approach marriage as a series of little marriages.
So you two are in counseling?
No, no. Not anymore. We were, but...
that was before I got hurt.
Mind if I ask what happened?
No, no. Not at all. I was riding my bike over Glen Canyon,
like I do every morning.
I must have veered off the road or something, I'm not really sure,
but I never saw or heard the truck.
Week later, I woke up in the hospital, broken collarbone, couple cracked ribs.
I was in a body cast for six months.
-Ouch. -[Marcus] Yeah.
It was tough at first.
It's getting better.
Everything is.
Work's great. Things with Ellie are a lot better.
You're a lucky guy.
She's beautiful, successful.
A lot of guys would kill to have a woman like that.
[chuckles] Thanks, man.
I'm just saying.
You have no idea what it's like
to see the woman you love touching another man,
kissing another man,
wondering if she really loves him.
What you might do if you got that man alone.
Oh, hey, man. Sorry to hear about your wife, too.
Ex. Ex-wife.
Yeah, well, either way.
-Hey, there. -Oh.
How you doing?
It was, man. It was good stuff, man. I appreciate the call. Let's do it again.
-Absolutely. We will. -All right.
-Hi. -Hi. How can I help you?
I'm not sure if you remember me from this morning,
but I'm a friend of, um, David Hammond's.
Um, I left a few things in his place last night.
So, I was just wondering if you could let me into his apartment.
We've all had those nights.
[whispering] Oh, my God.
No, no, no.
Hey, babe.
Golf was really fun. Yeah.
You on the way home from work?
You want me to pick up some dinner?
Okay. Headed to you right now.
Answer the phone. Courtney!
You've got about ten seconds until I hang up.
Courtney, I think David killed his wife.
That's not even remotely funny.
Listen to me. I know you are upset with me.
And you have every right to be.
But David is not the man that you think he is.
Everything from getting the job at the firm
to dating you has all been to get to me.
And you know this how?
Because I went to his apartment.
He had pictures of me on his computer.
He's been watching me.
Courtney, he's dangerous.
I gotta go.
No, Courtney, please!
-Hey, baby. -Hey.
So, who were you talking to?
What's that?
When I was coming down the hall, I heard you talking to someone.
Oh, uh, just a... a work call. It was nothing. [chuckles]
Sounded pretty tense.
You know how it is. Some people don't know
You know how it is. Some people don't know -how to take no for an answer. -[chuckles] Tell me about it.
-how to take no for an answer. -[chuckles] Tell me about it.
You shouldn't go through other people's phones.
What, why do you have photos of Ellie on there?
You know we're old friends.
Yeah, but these are new. Have you been following her?
-Janice asked me to do it. -Her old boss?
-Janice asked me to do it. -Her old boss? Yeah, she thought it was suspicious Ellie was leaving the firm so soon,
so she asked me to make sure she wasn't compromising anything.
[stammers] Was she?
Was she compromising anything?
No.
Yeah, I... I think I need some air.
Everything's gonna be just fine.
Courtney!
Courtney.
Courtney!
[gasping] Courtney!
Courtney. Courtney, wake up, please. Courtney.
Oh, God.
Somebody, help!
We sent units to his apartment, but he wasn't there. We'll find him.
Okay.
[sniffles] Is she gonna be all right?
She's fine.
Elle.
Elle, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay, honey. [sniffles]
-Where's Brittany? -She's fine. She's with Scott.
-Are you sure you're okay? -Yes, yes.
You must be the husband.
I'm Detective Larson.
-Can you tell me what's going on? -Her friend was attacked.
Attacked by who? What happened?
I'm gonna send a unit to your house until we find him.
In the meantime, if you need anything, anytime.
Thank you.
Babe, what happened? What's going on?
I'm gonna tell you everything when we get home.
-But please, get me out of here, okay? -Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I mean, this guy's out here drinking my beer.
I played golf with this son of a bitch!
I don't get it.
I don't get it. If you guys were so close, how come I never heard about him before?
I haven't talked to him since I graduated from college.
I haven't seen him since we graduated from college.
And when he showed up at the house,
I didn't know how... I... I didn't know how to tell you.
So, you... you screw him in the bathroom?
Oh, I'm sorry, you almost did.
I was drunk.
How do you do this to us, Elle?
I just got caught in a situation, and I did not...
I didn't know what to do.
The last thing that I ever wanted to do was hurt you.
I'm sorry.
If you were so upset about the way things were going,
why didn't you say something?
Because I didn't know what to say. I didn't know how to say it. I did not...
-I didn't know how to tell you anything. -Elle!
I don't understand how you can make a living
I don't understand how you can make a living talking to 12 people in a jury box that you don't even know...
talking to 12 people in a jury box that you don't even know...
and you can't talk to me?
I mean, Jesus, is our life really that bad?
No.
No, I love our life. I love our daughter. I love the life that we've built together.
I love you. I...
[whispers] I'm sorry.
Mom.
Dad.
-Why are there police cars outside? -[sighs]
Come sit, baby.
What's wrong?
Dad?
Just sit down.
So, the use of an accelerant is gonna make DNA tests very difficult,
and the dental samples are gonna take a while to reconstruct.
-Thank you. -[Marcus] Mm-hmm.
However, both the handwriting on the letter
and the clothing on the body appear to be a match for David.
Yeah.
We searched the apartment, and we found the folders that you mentioned.
There were also a number of searches on the computer about suicide.
Apparently, he left a message on his therapist's voicemail last night,
taking responsibility for everything...
including the murder of his ex-wife.
Oh, my God.
I know this isn't quite the resolution you were hoping for.
But it is a resolution.
Yeah.
[sighs] Um, thank you. Thank you for everything you've done. -We appreciate you. -Thank you.
-We appreciate you. -Thank you. Thanks. Thank you.
Thanks. Thank you.
Detective.
How's Courtney? Is there an update?
She's doing better. I took her statement this morning.
She's got stitches, a bad concussion,
but the doctor said she should be ready to receive visitors tomorrow.
[sighs] Thank you so much.
Marcus, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for all of it.
[Marcus] You know, I remember...
the first day that I realized I was in love with you.
It was like, in that moment, everything just...
made sense.
I can't tell you that I'm not angry.
And I can't tell you that I'm not hurt.
But what I can say is...
that I will always need you...
for my world to make sense.
So...
I told you before, I'll tell you again,
I guess you're stuck with me.
I think we're stuck with each other.
-Good catch. -[chuckles]
-Hey, babe. -Hey.
Look at this.
It's perfect.
There's no way I'm going in to the office today.
Don't.
You know?
We have so much to be thankful for.
I know what I'm thankful for.
You want some tea?
-Yeah. -All right, I'll get some.
...after murdering his ex-wife and her boyfriend,
as well as stalking an Oceancrest woman and her family.
David is a textbook definition of narcissistic personality disorder.
All right, guys. We gotta get that thing in first thing in the morning, all right?
Eight hours.
Stick it full.
Oh, shoot.
It's Linda. I need to go to the office and sign some documents
before the holiday.
-It's almost dark. -No, I know. I'll be quick.
All right.
-Bye, guys. Have fun. -[Brittany] Bye.
-Bring us a pizza. We're hungry. -I will.
-Hey, don't make me come down there now. -[chuckles]
Linda, I'm here!
No. No.
[David] You left them alone.
[whispers] Oh, David.
This is Detective Larson.
David is still alive.
Ellie? Slow down.
Where are you now?
I'm in my car. I'm driving to my house.
No one's answering.
[crying] Please. Get someone over there now.
Ellie. Ellie!
It's Detective Larson. I need units sent to 57 Shore Road immediately.
Marcus!
Brittany!
This is such a great song, right?
[grunts] What are you doing?
Remember that party senior year?
They must have played this entire album, like, twice.
Come on, dance with me.
Come on.
David, where's my husband?
Where's my... Where's my daughter? [gasps]
I'm disappointed.
You would think a man would put up much more of a fight for the woman that he loves.
Marcus?
Brittany?
[David] Ellie...
I know you think you love him.
But way down deep...
you realize you made a mistake, and that's okay.
We all make mistakes.
The important thing is we can be together now.
We can start a brand-new life.
Maybe you're right.
I knew you'd come around.
It's like my psychiatrist used to say.
Sometimes you just gotta put the past in the rearview mirror and move on.
Yeah.
-[grunts] -I don't wanna hurt you.
David, please!
I just believe some things are worth fighting for.
Marcus! Marcus!
-[Marcus] Ellie! -Honey?
-Marcus! -[Marcus] Help!
-[Ellie] Oh, God! -[sobbing]
Oh, here. Oh, sweetheart!
Oh, God!
Mom! [sobbing]
Honey, are you okay?
-Where is he now? -He's upstairs. Hold on. Lean forward.
Here. Here.
[Ellie] The police are here.
He's upstairs.
-Come on. -He's upstairs.
[Brittany] Go. Go! Go. Go. Go. Go.
Come on. Come on.
-Scott! -No, no, no, no, no, no, no, come on!
Elle, come on!
[Ellie] Go! Hurry.
Hey, we need help!
-Oh, my God. -Hey, go see if you can call for help.
I'll get Brittany out of here.
Come on, baby. Come on. Come on, get in the car.
Get in the car. Brittany, get in the car!
Hello? Is anyone there?
Somebody, please, help me. Please, somebody.
Can anyone hear me?
Hello? [screaming]
[David] Come here.
Brittany, go!
-Let her go. -[David grunts]
Come on, babe. Come on!
Go. Go. Go.
Marcus.
David, no!
Ellie...
I never meant for things to get out of hand.
Please. David, please, put the gun down.
Even now he's abandoning you.
Okay. Okay.
Okay, just calm down.
Can't you see we were meant to be together?
Oh, David.
-Please. -Let me make it up to you.
We'll start over.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
Honey, are you okay?
-[Ellie screaming] David! -[David grunts]
No! No!
I got you!
David, hold on!
I got you, Elle. I got you, baby.
I got you. I got you.
[Marcus] All right.
So you're leaving us already, huh?
Well, you're not paying that tuition for me to sit around here, are you?
I'm not. I'm not.
I love you.
Love you, too.
Call me when you get there.
And then every day after that so I know you're okay.
I will. Don't worry. I'll be back before you know it.
-Okay? Love you guys. -I love you, baby.
-[Brittany] See you soon. -Bye.
Drive safe.
Put your seat belt on.
I love you.
I love you, too, babe.
I'm so sorry.
Stop. Stop.
-Can't wait to get back to the city. -Yeah. Me, too.
-Come on. I'll cook you some dinner. -Nice.
You're a life saver, Casey Jones.
I learned from the best. Come on, we're almost there.
Bad doggies!
Impeccable timing, little brother. Very dramatic.
Help him, Michelangelo. He's hurt bad.
That's it. The resistance failed. The Krang won.
But… but it isn't over.
We've still got a ninja's greatest weapon…
hope.
That and a badass mystic warrior.
Mikey, we need a time gateway.
It'll take everything I have.
I know, but this is our last chance.
It's our only chance.
-Wait, what's going on? Where is he going? -Casey, listen.
The Krang first came to our planet through a mystic doorway.
The key that opened the doorway looked like this.
Why are you telling me this?
Because Mikey's about to send you back in time
to the day that the key was stolen.
Wait, he's gonna what?
The people who stole that key opened the doorway for the Krang.
You have to find it before that happens.
Find the key, stop the Krang.
-But, Sensei-- -Say it!
"Find the key, stop the Krang."
I don't want to lose you.
Casey, it's not about me.
They found us!
Mikey!
Master Michelangelo, no! You're gonna--
Casey…
when you're done saving the world, do me a favor.
Grab a slice!
-[cars honking] -Where…
I made it?
All right, Casey, here we go. Find the key, stop the Krang.
♪ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ♪
Easy does it, Leo.
You've got this.
Concentrate.
The whole world is counting on you…
to break the pizza box stack record!
One-hundred, twenty-five boxes!
They say it couldn't be done, but look who's doing it, moi.
That's Spanish for Leo.
Go ahead, my non-lingual friend, count your unhatched fowl.
My record stands until you reach the top,
which, according to my calculations of wind speed,
barometric pressure, and dew point, is highly unlikely. What?
According to my calculations,
as long as you believe in yourself, you can do anything!
Thanks, little brother. No one believes in himself more than me.
Leo!
Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo!
Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo! Leo!
-Yeah! [chuckles] I am Leo! -Yeah, baby!
[Raph] There you are.
I've been looking all over for you guys.
Raph, guess who just broke the record?
What? You did? How many did you-- [grunts]
Stop distracting Raph! We were supposed to be training--
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Hold that thought.
Donnie?
Donnie?
You, sir, have bested me. Mazel.
-Ahem? -Ahem?
Leo. Leo.
Leo! Leo!
Stop it!
Leo, we have work to do, and you dragged him out here for this?
Training, record-breaking. The choice was clear.
[Raph sighs] Dang it, Leo. Everything's not about you.
When are you gonna grow up and start acting like a hero?
And there it is. Gentlemen…
-What was that? What are you guys doing? -A little game I invented.
Every time you say "heroes," we take a bite of pizza.
I don't say "heroes" that often!
Leo!
So what if I say he-- that word a lot.
It's a good word. We need to be that word.
Relax, Raph. We've got this hero thing wired.
I mean, our ninjocity is off the charts.
We've got some kickin' mystic weapons.
And do I need to remind you who has four shells and defeated the Shredder?
-[Leo] Hey. -[Raph] Leo!
You just don't get it.
-[beeps] -Huh? What is all that-- That's me.
Looks like we have a 317-39.4 in progress!
Oh, come on!
Has nobody read Donnie's Big Book of Bad Guy Codes? Nobody?
-Nope. -Never gonna happen.
We did it! We got the whatcha-ma-hoosie-doodle!
Of course we did.
Nothing can stop Supervillain Warren Stone
and his conjuring compatriot, Hypno-Potamus!
There they are! Okay, here's the plan--
Raph, relax. Who needs a plan when we got crazy cool mystic powers?
Leo!
Come on, swords, it's portal time!
I'll see you guys later after I save the day! Buh-buh-bye!
Stop! We need to work together!
Wellington Sunday! It's those pesky Turtles.
License and registration.
Oh, I'm sorry, mate. I must have left it in my other jacket.
Leo! Ah!
Leo, we're coming.
Don't worry. I got 'em right where I want 'em. [moans]
Doesn't look that way to me. Donnie, Mikey, Maneuver 12.
-On it! -Ha!
Whip-o-rama!
Prepare to be Donnie'd by my mystic tech!
Oh boy.
Okay, creeps, hand over the stolen thingy!
Oh no.
That's gotta be what they stole!
I got it!
With those clumsy hands? [chuckles] No, I got this one.
Oh, you portal-chopped him!
"Portal-chopped," I like it. Maybe my new catchphrase?
Okay, let's see how it fits. "You've been portal chopped!"
[Foot Lieutenant] Uh-uh-uh-uh. I'll be taking this.
The Foot Clan?
Finally, after all these centuries, this is ours.
Yes, well, of course, thanks to us, delivered safe and sound.
No problemo, partner.
Hey, just quietly, are we partners? We are partners, yeah?
Oh man, that thing must be dangerous if the Foot Clan wants it.
Ya think?
Huh? What?
[Raph] I clearly said, "I got it." Everybody heard me say, "I got it."
Yeah, but I got it with style.
[Raph] But you didn't get it!
You lost it, and now we've got a Foot Clan situation, Leo.
What's it gonna take for you to be serious, Leo?
And end up with a worry line between my eyes like you?
No, no, no, I do not want a Raph chasm.
"Chasm"?
You know, valley, gorge, crevasse.
The only reason I have a chasm is I have to worry about you bozos 24/7.
You just don't get it, Leo.
I'm the oldest here.
I'm responsible for keeping us safe
and making sure we can handle anything that comes our way.
'Cause if I don't, you could all end up dead.
Sorry, I missed that.
Can you repeat everything from… well, everything?
No wonder you always want to train. You really need the practice.
Let him go, Mikey.
Wait! No!
Boys! Stop this arguing!
But, Dad, Leo keeps--
No more.
You are a team. You are brothers.
And most importantly, you are too loud!
I cannot hear my TV show!
Tristan finally proposed to Annabelle, but did she say yes?
I don't know because of you!
Be the ninjas I taught you to be,
respectful and quiet!
Sorry. Excuse me.
Hey, how am I supposed to find this thing?
So many people.
How am I gonna save them all, Sensei?
I really wish you were here.
Wait, you are!
I just need to find you.
April.
She'll know.
Hi, professor. Do you have a sec?
Are you even in this class?
I'm April O'Neil, journalism major.
I write for the Eastlaird University Daily News.
Maybe I could get some shots of you at the whiteboard for a story?
Oh! Of course.
-[farts] -So, uh, what… what should I do?
You know, just write something sciencey.
I actually have the perfect equation for your article.
Now a few where you're staring thoughtfully at your work.
[Professor] Oh, I always stare intently at my equations.
Especially this one.
You know, I think I should put on my lab coat.
-Look at it! -Oh! Okay.
You know, I could probably stare at this equation all day.
This is April O'Neil, investigative reporter, Eastlaird University Daily News.
For years, this college shot down rumors that a foreign government
is paying them millions
to develop a super-toxic herbicidal deforestation bomb.
Those rumors end today because I'm about to blow the lid off Big Chem.
April O'Neil.
-Ooh. This stuff looks nasty. -[shutter clicking]
-Hey! Who's there? -[gasps]
Evidence, baby.
Oh boy.
Well, it's a good thing video ain't the only thing I took.
April! Yes!
-Commander O'Neil-- -Catlike reflex!
What's the matter with you, creeping up on a person in the dark?
What the…
And then I saw that picture and I brought him here.
Sensei?
It's you!
It's all of you! Together!
I never thought I'd see you again! I'm so happy I could hug you! [groans]
Who are you, and why do you have a picture of us?
Yeah, who took this? 'Cause I look great.
What's your favorite pizza? 'Cause I'm ordering right now.
And why are you wearing genius-built apparel?
That's trademarked!
Grappling hook!
What's going on?
-[Mikey] He's trying to escape! -[grunts]
-Want me to knock him out again? -Let me.
Donnie? Donnie!
Oh, okay.
Wa… Wait, stop! I'm a friend. Let me explain.
Let's start over.
My name is Casey Jones, and the reason I have this photo
and your tech is because you gave it to me,
but not yet, because I'm from…
the future!
This isn't a joke.
Please, if time travel is possible, future Donnie would have come back
and already given me all the lottery numbers like we planned.
It's true. I need you to believe me. Humanity depends on it.
In the future, an alien race decimated the planet.
We were hunted. We lived in caves. We ate leaves and rats.
No offense.
None taken. We are delicious. [gulps]
I know how this sounds, but Master Leonardo gave me a mission.
I do like how he calls me "Master."
Of course I do.
You are the greatest ninja the world has ever seen.
You told me to find the key and stop the Krang.
"Aliens." Pfft.
Sure. This story just keeps getting better.
Splints?
"The Krang"?
I have heard that name.
Powerful, barbaric creatures worshiped by the Foot Clan.
Legend says they came from the stars.
Ruthless, unmerciful, with one desire,
to enslave our world like so many before us.
All seemed lost,
until great mystic warriors forged a mighty weapon,
a key that was used to lock them in a prison dimension beyond this realm.
Over the centuries, the mystic key remained hidden
to protect humankind and prevent the return of the Krang.
So…
Future boy is really from the future?
Mind… [imitates explosion]
Someone finds the key! Today!
They steal it and use it to open a doorway and free the Krang!
That's why I came back, to find it first.
Master Leonardo drew a picture on the back of that photo.
So to stop the Krang,
all we have to do is find the key before it's stolen.
What?
Yeah, did future handsome, amazing me tell you what to do
in case that already happened?
'Cause that already happened.
Oh no, we're too late! [sighs]
No, we're not.
'Cause we know who has the key, the Foot Clan.
Okay, we gotta find them before they use it,
and this time, we do it together!
Uh, can someone untie me now?
[Hypno-Potamus] Villain to villain, your hideout is a bit… lacking.
Might I suggest some velvet, a fireplace,
maybe a fuzzy white cat with a diamond necklace?
Tonight, we liberate our masters from their dimensional prison.
With this key,
we shall free them to lay waste to this world and enslave its people.
Ah, I thought we were just gonna rob a bank and be, you know, crime buddies.
We shall follow the Krang as they lead the Foot Clan to glory!
-[Leo] Bored. -[gasps]
You!
-Leo! -What?
I was waiting for a good spot to jump in, but they just kept blabbity-blab-ing.
There it is! That's the key.
Get them! Don't let them interfere with the ceremony!
No!
-It started! -[groans]
He's unlocking the doorway! We need to get up there right now!
Casey, go. We've got you covered.
[gasps] Oh no.
Oh no! They're here!
Then let's make sure their visit's short and sweet.
I'm finally free!
The people of this planet will pay for what they've done to me.
Welcome to Earth. I hope you don't enjoy your stay!
Enough tricks!
Mikey! Donnie! No!
No…
Raph, what happened to our powers?
They… They're gone.
What did they do to us?
Brother, sister, join me.
Time for us to finish remaking this universe in the image of Krang.
How I've waited for this day.
Indeed.
Brother, widen the portal and retrieve our ship, the Technodrome.
Once it is here, this world will kneel before us.
Oh, if you two don't mind, I haven't killed anything in ages.
No!
Retreat!
Retreat? We don't retreat!
Leo, for once, listen to me. They're too powerful and Dad's hurt.
You don't understand.
If we don't close that doorway, it's only gonna get worse.
Raph?
I'm not gonna argue with you, Leo! Donnie, escape pods, now!
You don't have to tell me twice!
Sensei, we need to get that key!
-[Leo grunts] -Leo!
Raph?
Raph, wait, no.
Wait, Raph! Raph! No, Raph! Raph! No, Raph!
[computer] Escape pods incoming.
[computer] Congratulations on surviving, fam.
-Huh? -[grunting]
[Donnie] Oh, I hate that.
Everyone okay? Anybody hurt?
How did we get here?
Donnie pods. We've never had to use those before.
So, how would everyone rate their escape experience?
"Very satisfied," "Very, very satisfied," "Extremely satisfied"?
-Donnie! -Sorry. Sorry.
Data collection calms me down. -[groans] -[gasps]
Splints.
This is terrible! Why did we leave?
In case you didn't notice, we were getting our butts kicked!
-[strains] -But my mission was to stop them!
Now, the Krang are using that key
to bring in something that will destroy the world.
We lost.
-Where's my other pod? -Where's Raph?
Ah, did you know this would happen? Why didn't you tell me?
-What are you talking about? -Easy!
-Leo, what's going on? Where's Raph? -Leo, what happened to Raph?
[Splinter] Leonardo?
They…
They got him.
You left Raph?
He left himself.
He used his pod to save me, all because I went after this stupid thing.
You got it! Nice.
"Nice"? They captured Raph!
He's from the future! He knew this would happen!
No, I didn't. This didn't happen in my time.
We changed the past, and you got the key.
That means there's still a chance to stop them.
-No, we have to save Raph. Come on. -Leo, wait.
If you won't come, I'll go myself.
-We've lost our mystic powers. -We don't have a plan!
We don't need a plan.
"I'm the greatest ninja the world's ever seen," his words.
Shouldn't we talk about this
before we run off all half-cocked, willy-nilly, pell-mell?
I keep being told I'm doing this hero thing wrong.
But I got the key, didn't I?
I get results, so now we're doing it my way.
My son, listen to your team.
This is not about you.
They made it about me when they took my brother.
Trust me, I got this.
Donnie, you're driving.
What do we do with this?
We can't just bring it with us, but we can't just leave it behind.
Then we should destroy it.
Splints and I will stay here and take care of business.
Thanks, Commander O'Neil.
"Commander"? I like the sound of that.
Oh, look at it.
-[groans] -Disgusting.
-[grunts] -Try looking in a mirror.
Ugh, it's talking at me.
I'm going to rip out its tongue.
[Krang 1] Forgive my sister.
She's got a bit of a temper.
And being in prison for a thousand years hasn't done her any favors.
You're not human.
What are you?
Let me go, and I'll show you.
You're more powerful than the people of this planet,
yet you defend them.
-Why? -It's my duty.
A word used by the weak.
Many planets before yours have spoken of duty.
They too have been consumed by the Krang.
And now our glorious crusade continues
to restore the natural order of things.
The strong will devour the weak.
Last I checked,
we weren't the ones locked in a prison dimension for a thousand years.
That's called "trash talk."
A rare misstep.
Once I retrieve the key from your comrades,
I will bring forth the mighty Technodrome,
and you will witness the true power of the Krang.
Now, where have they taken my key?
It won't tell you anything.
Let me kill it.
Lady brain face here is right. I'm not telling you jack.
You don't have to tell me.
I'll look myself.
There it is.
They always do it the hard way.
Our brother and I will secure a location for the dimensional doorway.
Take these soldiers and retrieve me my key.
We live to serve.
You will serve me whether you live or not.
[Casey Jones] What is this thing?
[Donnie laughs] Hold on to your gluteus maximi!
The Turtle Tank, baby! It's how we roll in the past.
I mean, the present. I mean…
-Ugh! Time travel's confusing. -They're on the move.
According to the subcutaneous tracker I put on Raph--
Wait, does that mean you put trackers on all of us?
"No"?
No, of course I did… n't.
Based on their trajectory, they're headed…
…to the tallest building in the city.
That's right, Metro Tower.
I heard the story so many times as a kid, but I never thought…
"And behold,
from their perch atop New York City, the Krang ripped open the sky itself."
"What came out was terror,
and what rained down upon us was worse than death."
They told that to kids?
Man, the future is harsh.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
We need to get into Metro Tower without being spotted.
We'll take the subway tunnels.
Subway tunnels don't offer much in the way of an escape if we need it.
-Are you sure about this? -Yeah, maybe we should--
Guys, we're doing it my way. Remember?
Prepare the site so we may bring forth the Technodrome.
Yes, brother.
See? Smooth sailing. We'll have Raph in no time.
I hope he's okay.
How are we gonna find him once we get there?
I have a lot of questions regarding "once we get there."
Relax. We'll do what we always do. Ninja in, ninja their faces, ninja out.
That's exactly how you freed all those families from the Krang labor camp.
Yeah, that sounds like me.
In the future, you guys are beyond amazing.
The mystic powers you're able to harness are on a whole other level.
Of course! What about my future?
I'm expecting big things for me.
How many Nobel prizes do I have? Don't tell me. I wanna be surprised.
Donnie, you were the most brilliant, innovative mind of all time.
I'm shocked, I am. Go on, continue to meet my expectations.
What do I do in the future?
You are the most powerful mystic warrior the world has ever known.
With those two hands, you sent me back in time.
Actually, there is something I should tell you.
[Turtle Tank] Auto brake engaged.
Think we're in the right place?
Looks like the Metro Tower station is on the other side of those vines.
Great. Let's hoof it.
Through the disgusting, drippy slime jungle?
I know. I know. Leo knows best,
but I'm not sharing my hand sanitizer.
[Leo] Feeling a lack of rush in this rush hour, right?
[Donnie] I don't know, Leo. Something feels…
off.
Don't worry. I won't let us die. I'm a mystic warrior.
"I feel better already," he said without a hint of sarcasm.
Look, the stairs.
Sneaking in from below was the right move. Those slimeballs will never see us coming.
[April] We tried to jackhammer it, flamethrower it, pour acid on it…
I thought lasers cut everything! How did that not work?
There's not even a scratch!
Maybe it was your aim.
Maybe your big rat head got in the way!
Mmm, I'll show you, fat rat head.
Okay, deep breaths.
You said some things, I said some things.
Maybe we should just get back to saving the world.
What's next?
This cannot be good.
April O'Neil!
[Krang 2] Come back here!
-[tires screeching] -[Splinter] Faster.
Faster!
I knew this was a bad idea.
Leo, there's too many. We should go back.
No, we're gonna get to those stairs.
Leo, we're not gonna make it! We have to turn back.
We push forward, get Raph, that's final.
Mystic hands!
Donnie! Mikey!
Oh no, Donnie, your soft shell! You're exposed!
We gotta find shelter!
Oh, oh, keep it down, Vomitello!
Oh. Keep it down, daddy!
Run, insects, but you can't escape!
[sighs] Don't!
The key, human! Give it to me!
What did you do to me? What did you do to my face?
I knew that stuff was nasty! I told y'all!
Yes, yes, you're a genius. Let's go.
[April] Donnie, come in.
They found us. Where should we go? Donnie?
[Donnie] We're trapped.
We are trapped in the subway under Metro Tower.
The tank is running on emergency power
and is covered in some kind of Krang bio-growth.
-I repeat-- -April, come quick!
We're getting squished!
We're on our way!
But, April, how will we get them out?
I've got an idea.
Yeesh. Remind me to never get on your bad side.
Casey! [moans]
Casey, you okay?
Donnie, Mikey, anybody?
What the heck was that?
Some kind of drippy, crazy Krang monster.
No, I mean you! Why weren't you listening to anybody?
Because I was trying to get us into the building!
That sure worked out well.
I was doing everything right. How could it go wrong?
Because you weren't listening to your team!
You don't have all the answers all the time!
I'm the greatest ninja the world's ever seen. You said that.
[sighs] I was wrong.
What?
You're impulsive, you're arrogant,
and you don't see that every decision you make could cost someone their life.
You want to know what really happens to your brothers in the future?
They die. Everybody dies fighting the Krang.
The world needs Master Leonardo.
And all we got is this guy.
We have an update on the strange situation at Metro Tower.
All contact has been lost with those inside the building,
and conflicting reports suggest
something is barricading entrance for emergency personnel.
Fools.
These creatures should welcome the power of the Krang.
You on the rooftop! Stop and surrender immediately!
[reporter] We've got eyes on the roof top where the police are confronting--
What is that?
You may begin. [roars]
[man] Look out!
-[strains] -[Leo] Look,
I know I'm not the Leo you knew in the future, and maybe I never will be.
This whole time I was sure my family needed me,
but the truth is I need them.
If we're gonna survive this, we have to do it together.
[Turtle Tank] Hull integrity, 4%. Breach imminent. Good luck.
Whew, good. We have an imminent amount of time.
"Imminent" means "soon," Mikey.
Don't worry. I'll save us with my mystic hands.
Casey must have been wrong about me.
This is it, Donnie.
We're gonna get crushed!
-[April] Knock-knock! -April?
Anyone order a rescue?
Boom goes the herbicide!
April!
You saved us!
Uncomfortable with emotion!
Where is Leo? And, uh, Future Boy?
Somewhere in there.
[Krang 2] Faster! They're this way.
I can smell them. [laughs]
-[screaming] -She found us! We gotta move now.
Oh man, is this what the future looks like?
Nope, the future is worse. Much worse.
Donnie, Mikey, do you read me?
[Donnie] Come in, Leo.
Donnie, where are you?
We've extracted from the subway and are ascending a staircase.
I'm getting a lot of interference, but if you hold still,
I can triangulate your position using a complex geo-location algorithm.
-[Casey Jones] Uh, Donnie? -Odd numbers, primes, no… almost.
-Almost! -[Splinter clears throat]
Ugh. I never get to use my algorithm.
Man, I am so glad you guys aren't dead.
Ditto.
Okay, before this gets too mushy, we need to locate Raph.
Can you tell me if he's in the building?
Bet your momma's subatomic particles I can.
Got him! He's close.
He's almost on top of us.
Wait, he is on top of us.
[all] Raph!
Quick, cut him down, get him out of there.
Hang on. We got you. Almost there.
Raph?
Surprise.
What did you do to my brother?
Improved him.
Thank you for this. We will be putting it to good use.
Come, the world awaits destruction.
Tear them apart!
We gotta move.
-Leo, move! [grunts] -No!
A shame our brethren didn't survive the prison dimension.
Then again, their weakness has no place in my new Krang empire.
Open and bring unto this world
the mighty power of Krang!
[radio] Warning! This is a warning!
…appears to be something falling from the sky--
Begin!
[Mikey] What do we do now?
I fear we are lost. The Krang are too powerful.
Maybe we could change the future some other way.
Guys, it's time to face facts. We can't change the future.
Says who?
Says the grandfather paradox, says physical determinism,
says the space-time continuum.
Look, I didn't want it to be true, but…
[sighs] …science.
That's it! Donnie's wrong.
The world is ending, yet the barbs continue.
Don't you remember? We already did change the future.
Raph never got kidnapped and turned into a Krang zombie in your time.
-Right, Casey? -No, he didn't.
That means we did change the future! We're just in a different… [stammers]
Bifurcated time branch?
Yes, yes, yes, that nerd thing.
You know what that means, right? We still have hope!
A ninja's greatest weapon.
Hey, I like that!
[sighs] Look, I'm done thinking I have all the answers.
I don't know how to beat the Krang,
but I do know our future isn't written until we write it as a team.
So what do we got?
Maybe…
Maybe we don't have to beat them.
Can't we just send them back to the prison dimension?
There's an idea! Donnie, what do those big, beautiful eyebrows have to say?
If we got control of their ship, we could send it back through the portal.
Yes! Yes! Now we're cooking. Who else?
If someone on the ground can get to that key…
We can close the doorway.
And then bye-bye Krang forever, baby!
Exactly. What do you say, Donnie? You ready to fly a space ship?
Literally the greatest question I have ever been asked.
All right, team, we have a plan. Let's go save the world.
Wait, but what about Raph?
That big jerk may be covered in goo and half alien,
but he's still our brother, and I'm not giving up on him.
I'm not leaving him behind.
There's the key. Let's go.
Like Casey said, let's go!
[Donnie] I wish my tech was working!
Usually, my cardio is jetpack-assisted.
I'm not getting credit for any of these steps!
Hey, question, is it too late to join April's team?
You two figure out how to hijack this ship.
I'm gonna find Raph.
So how do we hack this thing?
[Donnie] Best guess, main console?
Unfortunately, it's ocupado.
[Mikey] Uh, new plan.
Run!
Surprise. I've come for my brother.
Let me guess.
Duty.
[chuckles] He said doodie.
I see you got yourself an upgrade.
You'll pay for what you have done to me!
This psycho routine is a little thin. Where's the character development?
[Casey Jones] Leo's counting on us to get to that key.
I think I have an idea.
Cover me!
Raph, you're coming with me, whether you like it or not.
I don't want to fight you, but I will if I have to.
Oh, you will have to.
Bravo, Mikey!
There's no buttons, or computers, or anything.
Just a lot of drippy, ooey-gooey disgustingness.
I don't know how to hack in…
Oh God, I know what I have to do.
What?
No, I don't think I can do this.
-What are you talking about? -[gulps]
Oh no!
That's… [wretches] …so gross!
-I can't do it. -I believe in you!
-No, it's my worst nightmare. -I know.
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
Raph, I know you're in there somewhere. You've gotta snap out of this!
Do you feel what the power of the Krang can do?
I am saving this weak planet!
I am a gift!
It's not working. I need more of a connection.
Mikey, take off my battle shell.
No, you're too vulnerable with just your soft shell.
There's no time, hurry.
Donnie? [yelps]
Mikey, I am…
a spaceship!
I'm trying to save you, you idiot!
Why do you have to make things so hard?
You want to keep coming at me? Go ahead. I'm done fighting you.
What?
No!
Finally, man and machine
entwixed in perfect bionic synergy!
How dare you desecrate Krang's ship!
Donnie, Mikey!
I don't want to fight anymore.
I was fighting you because I didn't understand you,
but now I get it.
I always figured you were mad because you didn't like the way I did things.
But when I see what's happening to you,
and what's happening to them…
I realized it wasn't about me.
You didn't yell because you were mad, you yelled because you were scared.
It's scary to be responsible for the lives you protect.
Your team… your family,
but we do it anyway because that's what it means to be a hero.
If this is it, I want you to know I finally understand.
And I'm sorry.
Raph, Raph, there you are! Come back! Your family needs you.
-Leo? -Yes!
Mikey, Donnie, we can fight this.
Raph's doing it for us, so we do it for him.
That alien jerkface thinks we're weak
because he hasn't seen what we can do…
when we fight together!
It's pointless to resist Krang.
Give up!
You will be consumed like everyone else on this pathetic planet!
-[yells] -Fat chance.
We're not like everyone else on this planet.
We are…
…the Teenage…
-…Mutant… -…Ninja…
…Turtles!
If this isn't the poster shot, someone's getting fired.
-[thuds] -Oh, we are not done yet.
April O'Neil!
That's payback.
Keep her under that building until I bring it down.
Yeah!
Casey, get out of there!
Commander O'Neil!
Nice shot.
Donnie's almost got the ship to the other side. I have to get to the key.
See ya.
Come in, Sensei, it's Casey. Can you hear me?
Come in, Sensei! Can you hear me?
Okay! Donnie!
Cowabunga!
[Mikey] Flip-o-rama!
Let's roll.
Ka-zoom!
Raph, go.
On it!
Gotcha! Don't worry, Donnie!
This is not a hug. It's a rescue!
Where are we? Staten Island?
Oh, gross.
So how would everyone rate that rescue experience? Unsatisfied?
Very unsatisfied? Wish Donnie would have done it? Um-hum?
-[grunts] -Donnie.
Leo's still up there.
Casey. Casey, come in.
Sensei, I'm here. And I've got eyes on the key.
Tell me when you're home free, and I'll pull the plug.
Casey, listen to me.
When I get to the other side, you close that door.
What? Sensei, no!
[Leo] Casey, it's the only way. He's too strong.
He's not gonna stay on the other side unless I keep him there.
[Casey Jones] There has to be another way!
[Leo] We tried everything, Case. This is the only way.
Leo, please don't do this! Leo!
You're one to talk, big bro. Hero moves are totally your style.
Outmatched and alone, yet you persist.
For what?
Honor, redemption?
Sacrifice? All meaningless.
We'll see about that.
[Casey Jones] Leo, please! I can't lose you again.
[Leo] Hey, future me would be real proud of you. I'm proud of you.
Weak words, weak actions.
I have forever known what you fail to understand,
strength always prevails!
What you fail to understand is I missed on purpose.
No, enough of your little tricks.
Casey, close the portal now.
What?
No! Let go of me!
Casey, please.
You've been portal chopped.
You…
You've ruined everything!
And now… [chuckles] …my wrath will be reserved for you alone.
You think you've won, you wretched little pest?
Wipe that grin off your face!
Mikey, it's over.
Leo never gave up on us.
I'm not giving up on him.
Whoa. Mikey, whatever you're doing, don't stop!
We're here, Mikey. Together.
[sighs] Took you guys long enough.
[Raph] Leo!
-Leo? -Hey.
Eww! Are we in Staten Island?
-Come here! -Aww!
No pictures.
[Casey Jones] So this is "grabbing a slice"?
I don't get it.
Wait for it.
So much better than rats!
Hey, the rest of the world we saved is pretty great too.
All right, everybody, look up here.
April, you just got a message from someone named "Cassandra."
Looks like our friend Cassandra has been busy.
That's my mom!
There goes the space-time continuum.
-[April laughs] -You did it, little brother.
You really did it.
I'm proud of you.
[gulps] This wasn't about me.
It was about all of us doing what needed to be done
because we're heroes.
[laughs] You said "heroes."
There it is, gentlemen, our home.
What a town.
Beautiful.
And if it needs defending, we'll always rise to the challenge.
Speaking of which, you know what challenge I'm gonna rise to?
-Beating that record! -Yay!
No way! No, okay, fine.

Movie!
Okay, Lily, I didn't wake you up at 6:00 in the morning just to play.
It's time for another lesson on how to survive in a big family.
Poo-poo.
Lesson number 374, Breakfast Burrito Saturday.
Bawitotos!
Now that you have teeth, you'll want one of Dad's famous breakfast burritos all to yourself.
you'll want one of Dad's famous breakfast burritos all to yourself.
-[Lily] Lily! -Just like your sisters.
Sisters.
Which means it's you against them at the table.
-[gasps] Uh-oh. -Don't worry!
Because your big brother is the man with the plan. -Patent pending. -[giggles]
And today's plan is to get to those burritos before our sisters wake up.
[sniffs] I can smell them now. Okay, Lily, it's go-time.
Poo-poo.
So all you need to do is just watch and learn
because around here, no one outsmarts Lincoln…
Loud.
Nice try, Lincoln.
You're not the only one who remembered it's burritos Saturday.
Yay! Burritos!
[Lori] Lincoln!
The key is to having a plan is to always have a backup plan.
Backup plan.
♪ Hot burritos! ♪ ♪ Hot, hot burritos, hey! Do little a dance and move your feet-os! ♪
Hey! Morning, Lincoln! Hello, Lily.
Bawitoto.
That's right, sweetie. "Bawitotos." Mwah!
Hey, where're your sisters? I thought I heard them. Did you? Huh…
Burritos!
[sighs] Sorry, Lily. So much for watching and learning.
Backup plan.
Oh-ho-ho! The student has become the master.
Lola, we need to go to make it to your recital on time.
-Don't forget my science fair. -I have the Junior Morticians Death Match.
I'm working pit crew at the race track!
Soccer playoff.
-Joke-A-Palooza! -Don't forget my shred-off.
[gasps] You all have activities today?
-[Leni] Not me. -[sighs] I just have my fashion show.
That's an activity, honey!
We're not prepared for this! This is a ding dang disaster!
What do we do? Don't panic! Don't panic! [screaming] Don't panic!
Relax, everybody. I got this.
Another lesson, Lily.
It's always more important to help your family than outsmart them. All right, Louds. Let's go, go, go!
-Lori, golf clubs. -Thanks.
-Leni, measuring tape. -Thanks.
-Luna, guitar. -Thanks!
-Lynn, soccer ball. -Yeah!
Luan, rubber chicken.
-Lucy, black veil. -Thanks.
-Lola, flaming baton. -[Lola] Thanks.
-Lana, wrench set. -Thanks, Linc.
-Lisa, ammonium di… -Dichromate! Thank you, male sibling.
-All right, we got everything? -Yup, we're good to go.
Mom, Dad, you forgot something!
Oh, sorry, sweetie.
Okay, where to first?
-Race track. -Soccer field.
Dad, Lori's first. Take a right.
-Go, Lori! -Hole in one!
Can someone please hold this for a minute?
I got it.
Leni's next. [Lincoln] Go left. I know a shortcut.
Amazing!
Gotta go!
-Who's next? -It's Luna time.
Go, Luna! [whistling]
-Yeah, Luna! -[cheering]
Thanks, bro.
Go, go, go!
Why did the chicken cross the playground? To get to the other slide!
-Hey, Lincoln. -[Lincoln] I got it.
She shoots…
she scores!
-[cheering] -Lincoln, catch.
Oof! Got it. Dang it.
Lincoln.
You're next, Lola.
-Uh-uh. Hands off. -[Lincoln] Ow! Come on, we gotta get to Lana's race.
Lincoln will hold it.
Lisa, you're up.
-[cheering] -Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!
♪ We are the Louds! Loud and proud! ♪
♪ We are the Louds! ♪
Oh! We did it. Thank you, Lincoln.
You sure know how to keep the old Loud fam' running smoothly, kiddo.
♪ We are the Louds! Loud and proud! ♪
♪ We are the Louds! ♪
Yeah, Loud and too loud!
Let's get a pic of the kids for our Loud Wall of Fame.
Oh, great idea! Everyone, hold up your trophies!
-Get my good side. -I only have good sides.
-Yeah. -Not sure I'll show up, but…
-Get my funny side. -Whoa! Hey! Watch out!
-[grunts] -[Mom] Okay, everyone, squeeze in.
Sisters!
Hey. Guys, wait for me.
-Look, it's the Loud sisters! -Nobody tosses a baton like that one.
She embalmed my Uncle Jack!
I wish my family was as talented as they are.
Enough loudness. Scoots out.
Hey! You gotta pay to ride this hog, sonny.
Wait! Hey? Hey, guys? I want to be in the photo.
Oh, you just must be so proud of your girls.
-You're ding dang darn tootin'. -They are very special.
No trophy, no photo. [laughs]
Loser!
-Guess! I'm gonna be in the newspaper! -That lady wants to interview us on TV!
-[Lori] Most "likes" ever. -Me too.
-[Dad] How cool is that? -[sisters] Yeah!
[Dad] Let's go home and put these trophies on display!
[sighs] I wish everyone thought I was special.

♪ Unremarkable, ordinary me? ♪
Ordinary? You're talking crazy.
You're just saying that because you're my best friend.
Name one thing that makes me special.
How about three? You've read every single Ace Savvy comic twice,
you're the fifth-best junior magician in Royal Woods,
and that history report you wrote?
It was like I was at the signing of the Declaration of Independence!
Oh! And you can sing! That's four!
Anyone can do those things.
[sighs] Admit it, Clyde. I'm always going to be stuck in my sisters' shadows.
I know exactly what'll cheer you up.
My homemade cream puffs!
Or, as I like to call them, "dream puffs."
What-- What is it?
Too much cinnamon? Not enough cinnamon?
Actually, the recipe doesn't call for cinnamon but I can add it--
No, Clyde, it's the best!
It's just that you, my sisters, everyone is good at something. Except me.
[Clyde] Nice one, Clyde. You just made it worse.
Well, I'm not that good at baking.
Then how do you explain this?
[Clyde] I'm just lucky.
-Baking runs in my family. -What do you mean?
Remember when I took that trip to France with my Nana Gayle?
That's where I met my great-Nana May, -who owns a bakery in Paris. -Bonjour.
[Clyde] She told me about my great-great-Nana Collette, -who ran a crepe shop in Calais. -Bonjour.
And my great-great-great-great-great-Nana Helene, who baked for French royal family. Enchanté.
[Clyde] When I got home, Nana Gayle showed me their recipe books
[Clyde] When I got home, Nana Gayle showed me their recipe books and I made cream puffs.
She said baking was in my genes,
just like Nana May, Nana Colette, and Nana Helene.
-[gasps] -Sorry, was that confusing? -It was a lot of nanas. -No!
You just gave me an awesome idea! You're the best best friend ever!
[Mom] Hey, kiddos, it's late. Time to get ready for bed.
Last one has to take out the garbage…
for the rest of the month.
Uh-oh. A superb time to evacuate the premises.
-I get the mirror first! -Not happening, dude!
You can't brush me off. [laughs]
Quickly, let's skedaddle!
Um, I'm literally trying to brush my teeth here.
We all are, honey.
Shh, I'm trying to brush my hair and you made me lose count. Well, I'm plucking nose hairs and I lost count too!
Mom! Dad!
[laughs] Lincoln has to take out the trash for a month!
I don't care. What part of the world are we from?
-Who spit toothpaste on my arm? -Clyde's family's from France.
Well, my family is from right here in Royal Woods, honey.
I'm not sure where my family is from originally. Why?
If we knew, we could take a vacation and meet our relatives.
-Vacation! -Five-star hotel, please.
All we need to do is find out where Dad's family is from.
-Okay, let's just slow down, everyone. -Well, it can't hurt to find out.
All I will need, Father, is a DNA sample.
No needles. I hate needles!
Pshaw. Oh, Father. Needles are for amateurs.
I shoulda… picked the… needles!
Boy, I'm glad I know where I'm from.
[laughing] Please don't!
You couldn't have just made him spit in a cup?
There's a scientific word for that. Boring.
-Dad? -No more tickles!
-There, there. -Is it over?
Indeed. My test has determined that we hail from a land
the Romans called…
Caledonia.
Uh, just give us the street name, Lis.
Street name, Scotland.
-Scotland? -We have family in Scotland?
-Cool. -So exotic.
So international.
So expensive! Thirteen of us traveling all that way?
I know, but we always do find a way to make vacations work.
-And the kids always have so much fun. -Please! Can we, please?
[whispering] Prove your love to us.
Scotland, here we come.
-Yeah! -[cheering]
Let's check the old vacay coin jar! This is just what we've been saving for.
Where'd all the coins go?
What? This winning smile doesn't whiten itself, you know.
No bucks, no luck, dudes.
Mom, Dad, we can make this work! Trust me.
We just gotta be…
a little adventurous.

Loud family, welcome to Scotland.
-Whoa. -Wow. -You did it, Stinkin. -Way to go, bro.
-Lincoln, you're the man. -Totes awesome.
-[Dad] This is great, Lincoln. -Scotland!
[Lola] It's like something out of a fairy tale.
-I can't wait to meet our relatives. -Amazing.
I don't see a mall, but it's still totes pretty.
It's so wonderful, I don't even mind seeing it in the sunshine. -[gasps] -[shutter clicks]
[Scottish accent] Time fer a wee dauber doon yonder.
-An accent already, Dad? Really? -At least he's not wearing a kilt.
-Oh, yeah? Check it out. -My eyes!
Sweet knees, Pops.
Oh! Bobby's not gonna believe I'm here.
Boo Boo Bear.
Boo Boo Bear. Boo Boo Bear. Boo Boo Bear… -Owie! -Boo Boo Bear.
Babe. I miss you so much!
Oh, Boo Boo Bear.
I hope you got my texts! I sent one every hour on the hour just like you asked.
-How's the vacay? -It's amazing here.
What? Oh, I lost you there for a sec.
-I was saying how much I love Scotland. -Babe.
Wait. You're breaking up. I can't hear you. Babe, I can't hear you.
-I love Scot-- -Babe.
Breaking up… you.
Wait. What?
Breaking up… you.
Stupid phone.
Did Lori just break up with you?
She said she's in love with some other guy!
Don't just stand there!
You can't let some other guy be her Boo Boo Bear!
Heck no, I can't! There's only one Boo Boo Bear and that's me!
Looks like I'm going to Scotland!
-Wait! -Huh? What was I thinking? You can't ride a bike to Scotland…
What was I thinking? You can't ride a bike to Scotland…
…without a helmet.
Okay, everyone. So what do you say we meet some Louds?
[all cheering] Yes! Yeah!
Hmm. [gasps] Let's ask that fisherman where we can find them.
-Yes! -Yeah!
Excuse me. We've traveled halfway around the world to meet our relatives.
-We're the Louds! Do you know where-- -Louds? Louds!
Louds! Louds! Louds! Louds!
-Think he's coming back? -Don't worry, everyone.
I bet there are Louds this way. Follow me.
Let's do this!
Oh, yeah!
Whoa, cool!
What the sheep?
Hmm. Quaint yet illogical. Just like that door over there.
-Have a lovely day, my dear. -[all gasp]
-Watch your step, Mrs. Turnberry. -Thank you, Angus.
Someday, someone will help us fix this silly town.
[Angus] One can only hope, ma'am.
Looks like someone failed Door-Making 101.
Hey, I bet those signs will tell us where to look!
Or not. Someone failed Sign Making 101 too.
[woman] How do I get out of here?
Dudes, look at that!
It's nine o'clock and all is well.
-[all laughing] -Never seen that before.
Rita! They have a fish shop and a chip shop.
-The fish goes on chips! -No, the chips on fish!
Nobody likes cold fish.
-You're a cold fish! -Well, you married me, didn't you?
This place is crazy town. Talk about bonkers.
Who's running this show?
Have a nice day, Scott! Hi, Scott! Hey, Scott!
-Why are you calling everyone Scott? -Um, we're in Scott Land? Duh.
What's up, Scott? You must be-- [grunts]
Scott.
Yeah. How did you know that?
Leni?
Uh, bye, Scott from Scott Land.
That was Scott.
Hey, Angus, you're not going to believe who's here. Look! -[woman] Are those the Louds? -[gasps]
Well, blow my bagpipes!
-Oh, hi. -Hello.
Everyone is so friendly.
Pardon me. Are you really Louds?
Yes! We sure are!
Then welcome to Loch Loud!
-Loch Loud? -That's right, lad!

Forgive me! I'm Angus, the groundskeeper here at Loud Castle.
And I welcome you to your ancestral home!
-Sweet! -So fancy.
-This is more like it. -Wowie, wow.
I can't believe Louds lived here.
We could fit 100 of our houses in here.
Oh me, oh my!
Do my eyes deceive me? Why, you're, um…
Louds!
Yes, I heard the song, Angus. Everyone in Scotland heard the song.
Our dreams have come true, Morag! Louds are back after 400 years.
Oh, my!
Put me down!
Oh! Sorry. Sorry. Loud family, may I introduce Morag, the castle caretaker.
Oh! Would you care to take my bag?
Lola! Sorry.
I can barely believe Louds have returned to their rightful place.
Well, for a week.
A week? Not forevermore?
Oh, let's not pry, Angus.
The family is only here on holiday.
Yes, well, I do hope you enjoy your visit. You'll find lovely accommodations in the village.
Or they could stay here! It's their family's castle after all.
-You mean it? -We can stay?
[all cheering] Yes!
What a marvelous idea.
-I've never been so excited. -Can we call you Aunty Morag? -[gasps] Oi! Hands off the antiques. -Oh!
-[gasps] Oi! Hands off the antiques. -Oh!
-Oh, my. -It was like that already.
[chuckles] That one's on me.
Uh, Mr. Angus, sir, what can you tell us about our ancestors?
Oh! A grander clan this land has never seen!
-[Luna] Whoa! -[Lola] No way!
Am I experiencing double vision?
It's old-timey us!
When did we pose for this?
[Lori] Ten girls and one boy. Literally just like us.
That's amazing.
Yes!
Yeah. How about that?
Just a week. Only for a week.
Would you fancy a look at the rest of the castle? [all] Yes!
[Luan] Last one to their room is a Scotch egg. Get it?
-[Leni] No, I don't. -No touching!
It's just impossible to find good help these days.
No roughhousing. Hey, you! Hey, hands off the tapestries. Tapestries!
So, let me guess. The sisters were all special, right?
Oh, aye! All were exceptional.
Our loch has never seen anything quite like the Loud lassies!
Of course.
But there was also--
-Stinkin! -Lincoln!
-Come here. -Hurry!
-Chop, chop! -Sorry, Angus, I gotta go. What? What is it?
[Lori] You have to see this.
Wow! Look at this!
We all get our own rooms!
[sisters] Lincoln, come look.
I can jam in peace.
Cool.
I can rest in peace.
Spooky.
No more tea parties ruined by Lana's burping.
Wanna bet?
My room has a hot tub.
Yeah, I noticed.
I've found my happy place.
-[explosion] -Boom-boom!
Mine has a fashion runway!
[Lincoln] Styling!
-[mic feedback] -Mine is big enough to be a comedy club.
[laughs] We each have our own bathroom!
[all] What?
I'm gonna take like 100 leaks a day.
-Ah, there you are, lad. -[Lily giggles]
Before you were whisked away, I tried to tell you
that the most special of all your ancestors was the duke.
The duke?
Aye. And don't you know, you'll be staying in his room.
Wait. The boy in the painting was the duke?
-Aye. -Hang on.
The boy in the painting with the white hair was the duke?
Aye.
The boy in the painting with the white hair that had ten sisters and looked just like me was the duke?
The one and only! He was the most special Loud there ever was.
Yes!
[Angus] Far and wide people knew his name.
His deeds were noble. His heart was stout!
Sweet digs, Stinkin.
The boy was the duke!
Whatever tugs your tonsils, bro.
Hey, Angus, what's the deal with all the dragon stuff?
Ah, so you noticed! If it's dragons you fancy, there's something you should see. -[Lana] Ha! -[Angus] Come with me.
-[Lana] Ha! -[Angus] Come with me.
The reason why dragons are celebrated here is that they are a part of our history.
I knew it! Dragons are for reals.
[imitates buzzer] Sounds like hooey to me!
Oh, they're as real as the tartan in my kilt.
In fact, your ancestors had their very own dragon.
And when the family left, so did she.
Whoa, a dragon cave!
Keep dreaming.
If it's proof you need,
take a gander at what your ancestors' dragon left behind.
Whoa! Oh, man. I told you!
This is wack-a-doodle!
Miss Lynn, if you wouldn't mind taking Miss Lily for a moment.
Just as we hoped that someday Louds would return,
we hoped a dragon would too.
[gasps] It's hatched!
You mean there's a dragon on the loose in here?
-Uh-oh. -No sudden movements. Easy does it. Remain calm!
[both] Angus!
Ah! Run for your lives!
-Aw, so cute. -Puppy dragon.
Look at that little face.
-[chuckles] -We gotta name this little pup.
Lela.
[Lana] Her name is Lela.
[Luan] I love her so much.
She's so cute.
Biologically improbable yet so adorable.
Can we keep her?
Okay. But I am not changing her diaper.
-Yes! -Thanks, Mom.
Dude, pick a key.
Uh, what are you doing, honey?
Duke-ing.
Right in front of us?
You know we have our own bathrooms now.
Nice toilet paper scarf.
Seriously? Pantaloons this time of year?
I think Lincoln's gone a little panta-looney. Get it?
[exclaims] What the what?
At least someone knows royalty when they see it.
The rest of you might wanna get on board. 'Cause this Loud is about to rule.
-Dinner is served. -[Lincoln] I'm okay.
-I cooked everything in the castle. -Whoa!
I ran out of garlic, so I used Gaelic.
[laughs] Good one, Dad.
-[all cheering] -[Luan] I call the turkey!
Save some for me.
[Lana] Yay, burritos!
This is all your doing.
It was my pleasure.
What a day!
The Louds are back and so is a dragon.
Bawitotos.
I'm so glad we did this.
[in Scottish accent] Aye, m'lady. What a happy clan we have.
Thanks, Angus.
-Mmm. -[Lily] Bawitos.
So, what's a guy got to do to become the duke around here?
Come again?
I was thinking about it, and the duke and I look alike,
we both have ten sisters, white hair, a turkey tail, we're the same height…
Dragon.
Holy moly, she grows fast.
Big girl!
So the way I see it, A plus B equals me being the new duke!
What do you think?
Lincoln, I'm afraid it's not that simple, lad.
[sighs] Wisely spoken. You should listen to Angus.
One can only become the duke by making life better
for the people and our village.
I see. Help the town and become the duke. Piece of cake.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do.
'Cause tomorrow, I'm gonna duke this town up! Oh, yeah!
You fool! Blathering on to that featherbrained boy
about becoming the duke!
Oh, the people would love a new duke.
[imitating Angus] "Oh, the people would love a new duke.”
[normal voice] I don't care a jot about those peasants!
They're not peasants, Morag. They're our neighbors, friends.
Enough with your twaddle!
Thanks to you flapping your gob, I'm stuck with these hooligans!
Crashing through the crowded halls, dodging girls like--
-Ping pong balls? -Just to reach the bathroom on time.
[chuckles] That's rather catchy.
Don't you get cheeky with me.
My ancestors have cared for this castle in peace and quiet
ever since they drove away the…
I mean, ever since the, you know, the first Louds sailed away forever.
Oh, I deserve better than to be banished to your wretched hovel.
It's only for a week.
And you'll have oodles of quietness here in my little castle.
Shall I give you the grand t-- Oof.
Good night, Morag.
Castle spirits, hear my plea.
I summon a Loud from my family.
On mystic winds, across Scottish moors,
send the girl who once walked these floors.
-What time is it? -It's late.
I'm still parachute-lagged.
What's this about, Luce? I need my sleep.
My family from this world, meet our family from another.
Lucille Loud.
Charmed, I'm sure.
-[all gasp] -G-G-Ghost!
O-M-Ghost!
She's like a glow-in-the-dark Lucy.
It's a pleasure to meet you, and to be home after 400 years.
[gasps] Dragons and ghosts?
-This place has everything. -Whoa.
-She's literally floating. -Whoa.
-Love the see-through look. -Wow!
-Honey? -What?
We did take this trip to meet relatives.
Yeah, but not creepy ghosty ones.
-[gasps] -I heard that.
-Good morning, Morag. -Your athletic supporter, sir?
Not mine. [laughs]
Dear Old Aggie,
you so cleverly drove away those royal ruffians
to have peace and quiet.
How pained you'd be to hear new Louds have returned!
Thank goodness it's only for a week.
-I wanna ride her! -My turn!
Oh, you found it. Thanks, Morag.
Oh! Poor Aggie! Look what those beasts did to you.
-Say, "Ah." -Ah.
Excellent.
Is someone there?
-I-- -[continues humming]
[Lily] Poo-poo.
Only for a week.
[Angus] Good day, lad.
You got that right. I'm about to become the new duke!
You might wanna tell Morag to start polishing that crown.
I certainly will not be doing that.

All right. Then how do we make this official?
-We have a coronation. -[chanting] Duke! Duke! Duke!
Oh, how glorious. Loch Loud will have a new duke for a week.
Duke for a week?
Actually, six days, 11 hours, 23 minutes and four seconds.
But who's counting?
I burst into dance for a tourist?
-[man] Never mind. -Whoa! [grunts]
Such a shame.
-Lincoln? -[groaning]
Take heart, lad. The hard part is over.
Our people want you to be the duke.
Now all you need to do is convince your family to move here, eh?
Easy peasy.
How do I look?
Oh! Brilliant, sir. But why a suit?
It's my blue convincing suit. Patent pending.
I wear it whenever I need to talk my family into something.
It's never let me down. Right, Lil?
Man with plan.
[Lincoln on video] Scotland! Where the Loud clan first rose to prominence.
Our family came here on vacation to find our ancestors.
We found so much more.
We found our town, our castle, our history.
And most importantly, we found ourselves.
So true.
[Lincoln] But soon, our vacation will end.
[screams] No!
[Lincoln] Unless we seize the chance of a lifetime and fulfill our destiny!
How, you may ask?
By moving to Scotland, where the Louds can truly live loud!
[Lily on video] Loud and proud.
That last part always gets me. So?
[in Scottish accent] I'm in! Scotland forever!
-[clears throat] -This is all 'cause you wanna be the duke.
What? No. It has nothing to do--
-[Lynn] No, no! -[Luna] Busted.
-No, no, no. -Fat chance, Lincoln.
Yeah, okay. So maybe that has a little to do with it.
But moving here would be wonderful for all of us!
Sweetie, we're on vacation. We have a life in Royal Woods.
-Not to mention schools. -Friends.
Adoring fans.
We're not moving to Scotland.
[Lori] Yeah.
[sighs] Mom's right. Forget it.
We should just enjoy our vacation and go back home…
to our house with one bathroom.
-We're moving to Scotland. -[all cheer]
-Go, Lincoln! -That's my brother.
Royalty runs in the family.
Oh, thank you.
For four centuries, our loch has been without a duke,
ever since the first Louds broke our hearts
and decided to sail away forever.
I cannot believe my ears.
From today on, our village will be duke-less no more.
Lincoln Albert Loud, by the powers vested in me… Ooh! Cool duke stick.
Ooh! Cool duke stick.
It's the royal scepter, sire.
By the powers vested in me,
I dub thee
the…
I dub thee…
Duke of…
The Duke of Loch Loud.

Loud Castle! [giggles]
[sighs] Isn't this awesome?
Us Louds, you two, hanging at the castle just like old times.
[Morag screaming] I hate
the Louds!
-[Lucy] What a wretched day. -I wish we were out in it.
But seriously, cousin, we have an urgent matter to discuss.
Our bond of eternal sadness?
Nay, what I must say, others may not want to hear.
Lucy, what Morag said at the coronation is not true.
My family did return to Loch Loud.
On that fateful day, our hearts were as full as our sails.
We longed to be home again.
I've missed me laboratory.
And my coffin.
And me Scott. He's from Scott Land.
We know.
Home is on the horizon. Land ho!
Look, family! It's our Lolo. She's come to escort us home.
-Lolo! -That's our girl!
What's come over her? She's turning us away.
-How are we to get home? -We're not.
The dragon forbids it.
But why?
According to ancient lore, the dragon is the protector of the loch
and a duke's truest friend, until it deems the duke worthy no more.
Ding dang ancient lore!
I've done nothing to earn such a fate. Lolo, I command thee to let us pass!
‘Tis no use, dear brother. Our fate has been decided.
I shan't argue with that. Mother, turn the ship around.
And to all, bid your farewell to Loch Loud.
[screams] What now?
Uh… you must give the crown back.
Of course.
That's so sad.
Normally I like sad, but that's too much.
Why would Morag lie about your family never returning?
[gasps] Our caretaker Old Aggie!
She kept a journal that chronicled everything that happened in the castle.
Perhaps the answer lies within its pages. I wonder where it may be?
My deviously brilliant, wicked, dear Old Aggie.
You were the first to rid this loch of hideous Louds!
Well done, you monstrous, pea-brained cretin.
You got rid of your duke and I shall get rid of mine!
Hi, Lincoln!
How is the best bud that a best bud could ever have enjoying his vacation?
You won't believe it, Clyde! Turns out my family is royalty
-and I'm the new Duke of Loch Loud. -[growls]
[Clyde] Holy dream puff! That's awesome!
I guess now that you're a duke, you don't have to worry if you're special.
[Lincoln] Yup! No more being stuck in my sisters' shadows.
-[Clyde] Yes! -[Lincoln] All hail the duke!
Wait a minute. How are you gonna be the Duke of Loch Loud in Royal Woods?
Do they have, like, an exchange program?
Um, not exactly, which is why…
we moved to Scotland.
Clyde?
Lincoln, this is the coolest news!
It is? That's such a relief. I can't wait for you to come visit.
Me too! I'd love to visit Scotland! Hey, I gotta go.
But call me later, 'cause I wanna hear all about your new amazing life!
Needs more cinnamon.
Ah, what a friend.
The sisters! Yes, that's it.

-Morag. -Ah!
You… You're a ghost!
You told the people that my family sailed away forever. 'Tis not true.
I was there.
I know only what my ancestors passed down to me.
I want to see for myself.
-Old Aggie's journal. Where might it be? -A journal?
I didn't know she kept a journal.
[both] We've got our eyes on you.
Bravo, Miss Luna. Bravo.
Aw, thanks, Morag, dude. Rock on!
Indeed. Heh.
May-- May I ask? Why hide your musical light under a bushel?
I'd tell you if I knew what that meant.
The village has not heard such stunning bagpipery
since the golden age of your ancestors.
Whoa! I had no idea my oldies liked to rock.
Yes, they excelled in many things.
Music, fashion, sport, wise-crackery.
It was they who put the loud in Loch Loud.
Oh, how the people would love
for that golden age to return with you lassies.
I'm snacking what you're packing.
Uh… come again?
I'm in, dude! I'll go tell the other lassies.
Ooh, a letter! Say thanks to Lisa, big metal bee.
[squeals] I'm supes excited! My sisters and I are gonna perform in the village.
And you'll look smashing in this new dress.
[laughs] Quite funny.
[Lincoln] For my next spellbinding act of magic,
I need one crown.
Voila!
Oh, dear.
Royal crown, I see thee so.
But this duke is hungry, and he wants a burrito!
[sighs] My bad, Lil. I didn't give you enough time for the switcheroo.
Oh, no, sire! It was jolly good enchantment!
Now, Sir Duke, I believe it's time for you to seize the royal day
and go to the village, and serve your people!
Um, I think me and Lil will stay here and work on our trick.
But, sire, the people have been waiting 400 years
for their duke to make their loch a finer place.
Well, when you put it that way…
Lil, your big bro's got some important duke business to do.
A banner job, sire.
Our chimneys have needed a keen spiffying for centuries.
Uh-huh. How many more?
One down. Just 432 to go.
Well, it's worth it if the people are happy.
Sire, I'm not certain where that's coming from.
What? Not again!
Lincoln? Is everything all right?
[crowd chanting] Luna! Luna!
When is a piece of wood like a king? When it's a ruler.
Here's Leni Loud. She's the talk of the Highlands.
This is what talent looks like, people.
Yeah!
[woman] Look at that sister skating!
Oh, yeah. Drink in the talent.
Loud sisters hoo! Loud sisters ha! Loud sisters ho, ho, ho!
[Morag] Oh, poor, poor duke.
It's not fair. I'm the duke!
I'm supposed to be the most special Loud of all.
Not stuck in your sisters' shadows.
That's what I always say.
Is it now? Hmm.
There must be something we could do
to put a proper spotlight on our dear duke.
Yeah.
Ooh. What about that?
-What about what, sire? -That!
I could ride the dragon just like my ancestor.
[gasps] Brilliant idea, sire!
I can just picture it.
The people watch you soar overhead, then break into cheers,
more certain than ever that you are the most special Loud there ever was.
This is gonna be so awesome!
Oh, yes.
More than you could ever imagine.
[Lincoln] Hello, my people!
Lincoln?
Go, Lela!
-[Lela roars] -[Lincoln] Woo-hoo! Yeah!
This is amazing.
[Lincoln] Duked it.
No one's ridden a dragon here in centuries.
[man] He drew his own face!
Hey! Adoring fans?
[laughs] Yes!
Time for the real spectacle.
Lela, what are you doing?
-Lincoln! -My baby bro.
Why… can't… I steer you?
-Lincoln. -[Dad] This way!
-[Dad] Come on. -There he is!
-Lincoln! -Stop!
Ah! Get out of the way!
Look out!
Oh, no! We're in-tuh-rubble. Get it?
-Help! -Lad, grab on!
Och, steady now, I've got you!
There you go.
Oh, no.
Don't worry. I can fix everything.
I'm the duke, remember? Here, watch.
See? Good as new.
-[crowd gasps] -Oh, no! It's okay. You still have the fish shop.
That's a relief.
-[shouting] -[woman] How could you?
-We trusted you. -I loved that chippie!
How dare he?
Lincoln!
-What a mess. -[Leni] It's a disaster.
-[Lana] This place is trashed. -[Luna] Total bummer.
Oh, don't be sad.
Lela did precisely what she was asked to do.
That's it.
Good girl! Morag needs you to be big and strong.
Even dukes have bad days, sire.
[Lincoln] Bad day? Try "worst day ever." From the worst duke ever.
It hurts me to hear you say such a thing.
The people need you now more than ever.
[sisters] Lincoln? Lincoln?
Hey, everyone! I found him!
-[Lori gasps] -[all clamoring] -Are you all right? -How you doing, buddy?
-We were worried about you, honey. -Yeah, you really bombed out there.
-Lola! -Not funny.
Totally uncool, dude.
If you'll let me finish!
We all blow it sometimes. [whispering] Even me.
We want you to know that we talked about it,
and tomorrow, we're gonna help you rebuild the town.
Really? Aw, you guys are the best.
Well, of course they are! They're Louds!
Do you think the people will forgive me?
If there's one thing about our people, it's that they don't keep a grudge.
Go home, Duke! Go home, Duke! Go home, Duke!
-We've lost everything! -Out with you!
Leave our loch!
They're just blowing off some steam.
-Oh, they'll come around. -Just give 'em time, bro.
No, they're right.
Sire, no. I beg of you.
I don't deserve to be the duke.
Can we go home now?
Toodle pip. Bye-bye!
I wouldn't want this to be seen by the wrong eyes.
Now, dear Aggie, it's time I fulfilled my destiny.
Gasp. It cannot be. Old Aggie betrayed us!
My dearest friends, thanks to you, the Louds will be gone forevermore!
-[cheering] -Great job!
Glad that's over. Back home we go.
Oh, sorry, almost forgot to mention.
Before the Louds skedaddled off,
they requested that I be crowned duchess!
I was like, "Me? What?"
They were like, "Yeah, totally, you're the best.”
It was so embarrassing. But how could I say no?
So let's get on with it. Trumpets, robe, adoration.
Morag, this is not--
By the power vested in me, blahddy blah blah,
Angus dubs me the Duchess of Loch Loud!
You can't do this.
Silence, you ninny.
Oh, for argyle's sake.
[crowd chanting] Duchess! Duchess! Duchess!
No!
The Louds did no such thing.
I was there. They never gave you the crown!
-[groans] -Angus is as honest as the day is long. Is it true, Morag?
You know what? I could lie.
But why bother?
Guilty as accused!
Our people deserve better than a liar and a thief!
We willnae stand for it! Imposter!
Very well. I tried doing this the nice way.
Now I'll do it my way.
We've been run out of lots of malls before, but never a whole country.
I didn't get to say goodbye to Scott!
-[sobbing] -Lela!
Or Lucille.
-Yo, Luce, looks like you'll get a chance. -[Lucy] Gasp!
Cousins! Cousins!
Lucille.
I come with grave news.
The best kind.
Not this time, Lucy.
Morag has stolen the crown from our family and made herself duchess.
-Rude! -What?
That's nefarious.
She can't do that.
We knew Morag couldn't be trusted.
But I did trust her.
-[Lucille] I fear it gets worse. -Of course it does.
Morag is using the dragon to chase away the people of Loch Loud.
-What? -How?
With the ancient dragon stone. It can turn a good dragon evil.
Wait. My dragon ride.
That's why I couldn't control Lela! She was under Morag's power.
Translation, Morag wrecked the village, not you.
It's still my fault.
I wanted to be the duke so badly, I let Morag trick me.
Now those people will lose their homes.
I've gotta do something about this.
No, we all do.
You're always helping us.
This time, we're helping you.
[Angus] Careful now.
Hurry. Come on, this way.
-[Lincoln] Angus. -Blow me bagpipes!
Sire! Sisters!
You're back! But I'm afraid Morag is mad as a March hare!
We know. We've got a plan to get that scepter and save the village.
I'd say day one as the duchess has been a smashing success!
[sighs] Peace and quiet at last.
[Lincoln on PA] Testing one, two, three.
-What? -Let's start the show.
The Louds!
-I don't ding-dang get it. -A boat, a crown, a muscle-arm?
And a smiley-face poop? What is Leni trying to tell us?
Boat go bye-bye.
-[both scream] -Kids!
-[Dad] Starboard! -[Mom] What does that mean?
[Dad] I don't know!
I thought I was done with you!
Show yourselves, you deplorable, knee-high plonkers.
-[cheers, applause] -Ah!
Okay, girls!
Operation "Get The Scepter From Morag And Save The Village Before It's Too Late
And Also Think Of A Shorter Name For This Operation" is a go!
Luan, you're up.
There once was a duchess named Morag Whose hair smelled like a floor rag
When she stole the crown Everyone frowned
'Cause now their ruler was a poo-bag
Come on, feel the noise!
Fore!
Leni, go!
Yay!
Ah! My eyes!
That teeth whitening was worth it.
Oops. Sorry.
-Lucy, you know what to do. -Morag, catch me if you can.
Gotcha.
I was almost a goner. Maybe next time.
Fire!
Angus! What is going on?
-My dear Louds, it's madness! -Where are the kids?
Oh, you know, just battling a fire-breathing dragon.
-This way. -Wait! I'm not ready.
-[in Scottish accent] Now I'm ready. -Blow me bagpipes!
That's it, Luce! Keep coming!
Here we go. It's my turn. I can do this.
Yes! I'm on the dragon.
Ah! I'm on the dragon!
Easy now.
Fire!
-[gasps] You! -I won't let you get away with this!
-Let go! -Never.
-[Lincoln] You stole it. -It's mine!
Lincoln needs our help. We have to get the others.
I command you to let go!
Command? Is that what this is all about? Power?
Ha! No, this crown will guarantee no Louds ever bother me again!
[gasps] Hate to bother you, but…
[Luna] Lincoln!
[Lola] We're coming!
-[gasps] -Holy moly!
-Ah! There he is! -[Mom] My baby!
[Luan] We're here, brother. Don't worry.
-[all scream] -No, Lela!
[Morag cackles] Oh, you really bungled it.
You should have sailed away while you had the chance!
Now prepare to be loud no more!
Fire!
No!
Stop!
-[gasps] -Lincoln!
You want the crown so bad? Come and get it!
-Lincoln! -Don't do this!
Lela.
-Lincoln! -What do we do now?
[Dad] Just don't panic. Don't panic! Don't panic! Don't panic!
Oh, what a pity. Nowhere to run.
This isn't the way to get what you want. Maybe you can tell everyone you're sorry.
Why, yes, I could…
if I were a hare-brained fool!
Now give me the crown!
Never, Morag.
It's "Duchess" to you.
You can have all the crowns in the world, but you'll never be the duchess.
You will never be special!
Just plain, boring Lincoln Loud.
Always in your sisters' shadows, just where you belong.
You're wrong.
I'm the fifth-best junior magician in Royal Woods.
What?
What enchantment is this?
Enough!
No more tricks!
Except one! Presto!
Dragon, obliterate this ninny and bring me the crown!
What?
Oh, dear.
Ta-da! Lela!
Backup plan. [laughing]
We did it! Way to go, Lily! [laughs]
All I wanted was my peace and quiet.
-And I will have it! Give me the crown! -Let go!
Lincoln!
Gotcha, Lil!
Wait. What?
Lela!
Good girl.
Slow down, Rita!
-Careful, sweetie. -Ow!
Lily flying dragon!
Let me go, you horrid beast!
-That was awesome! -Way to go, Linc and Lily!
My babies!
Oh, Lela, we can't thank you enough.
Way to go, Lincoln.
We love you, Lela.
Who's a good dragon?
To the Louds! For saving our home!
To Lincoln, whom history will remember as the loudest of the Louds!
I'm sorry we doubted you.
Duke Loud hoo! Duke Loud ha! Duke Loud ho, ho, ho!
Our duke is back!
What you waiting for, Linc? Put that baby on.
If you don't, I will.
Ever since we came here, I wanted this crown more than anything.
I thought if I had it, I'd finally be special like my sisters.
When I wore it,
all I cared about was what it would do for me, not what I could do for you.
I'm sorry for being selfish.
The thing is, someone kept trying to tell me what it really means to wear the crown,
but I wouldn't listen. I'm sorry for that too.
That's why there's only one person who deserves to wear this crown.
-Angus, with the power vested in me-- -Lad, no.
-By the royal Loud family-- -I can't.
I dub thee the Duke of Loch Loud!
No, no, I'm just a simple groundskeeper.
-Oh, you're so much more. -You're like family.
You've always been there for us.
[boy] The people have spoken, Angus.
-[gasping] -The duke!
-Astonishing. -It's our family.
Yo, cuz!
Twelve more ghosts. [laughs] That's fine. I'm totally fi--
A more worthy duke I've never laid eyes upon.
For you are the true caretaker of our home and us all.
Thank you, Your Dukeship.
Well, blow my bagpipes.
-So, Duke, what about me fish shop? -What about my chip shop?
What about her?
Oh, dear.
Unhand me, beast!
The dragon is the true guardian of the loch.
She shall decide Morag's fate.
The joke's on you, you scaly, putrid lummox!
You gave me my peace and quiet.
What? No. No! No!
Lincoln, you giving the crown to Angus was the coolest!
You're a good dude, dude.
Yes!
But all that stuff about you not feeling special…
What was that?
You're all so good at everything.
You win trophies, get your pictures taken, and…
I wanted to be special too.
Lincoln, you are special.
I am?
Yeah. Just like how Angus takes care of everyone in Loch Loud.
You take care of us.
Every day, bro.
For reals.
That's why you're the most special brother ever.
-Literally. -That's right.
-I'll say. -Indubitably.
I'm good with that.
I love you, Lincoln.
Warm feelings.

We're throwing the dictionary at you
and so far you are showing this dictionary who is boss.
We've now reached the start of round 20,
the round I informed you would be the final one of this competition.
When we get to the end of round 20,
we will take an extraordinary step of declaring as co-champions
those of you still remaining in the competition.
-[pronouncer] You are correct! -[audience cheering]
-[pronouncer] You are correct! -[audience cheering]
[pronouncer] You are correct!
You are correct.
-You are correct. -[audience cheering]
Correct.
Correct.
You are correct.
[male host 1] It's complete.
You're all champions of the 2019 Scripps National Spelling Bee.
[male host 1] They will forever be remembered as the Elite 8,
the eight spellers that for three and a half hours
took the best parts the dictionary had to throw at them,
and this is the night that the kids won the Spelling Bee.
And there you have it,
a picture that will be on the front page of every newspaper and website.
[male] Spelling bees are a time-honored American tradition
and the Scripps National Spelling Bee
is the most prestigious contest in the country.
[female] South Asian-American kids are dominating the Scripps National Spelling Bee.
I think people are curious about, like, do they have a secret?
Is there something that they’re genetically predisposed to knowing?
The most phenomenal assemblage of super spellers.
Meet the kids who exhausted the dictionary itself.
-The Octo-Champs, ladies and gentlemen! -[audience cheering, applauding]
What kind of a name is Erin?
Since 2008, a decade of dominance.
[Hari Kondabolu] We rival the Yankees, the Dallas Cowboys, Celtics, Lakers.
Indian-American kids in spelling, like, we’re in that.
When we find something that works, we go all in.
[male] Something clearly is going on that needs to be better understood.
...international society of people with high IQs has two new members.
They're children!
Three-year-old Akash Vukoti and five-year-old Amritha Vukoti
have been accepted into the American MENSA.
Welcome to Little Big Shots!
You have never seen kids like the ones who are coming out here today.
[Steve Harvey] Cona-sewer.
[laughing] No! Not "cona-sewer."
-Okay, catch it up. -[audience laughing]
The kids getting the big buzz at the Spelling Bee.
A six-year-old making history
as the first first-grader ever in the competition.
Inviscate.
-Inviscate. -[female] That is correct.
Well, funny story. First, my uncle... One of my uncles...
was feeding me something like a type of rice thingy.
And then he showed a spoon, told me to spell "spoon."
I said...
So the next day, the same uncle came to me and said to spell "spoon" again.
I spelled...
That was not normal for, you know, for a two... just two-years-old kid
to spell it back in the same sequence, in the same order of the alphabet.
That was the first time when we noticed that, oh, he...
He has something into the spellings.
That’s when my parents saw that first interest.
First interest.
-[Mom] Who are the Spelling Bee champion? -I am!
I am the Spelling Bee champion.
-What's "L" for? -Lion!
-What’s "lion" spelling? -Lion? L-I-O-N. Lion!
[Krishna] I came from a rural village in India.
[Krishna] I came from a rural village in India. If I didn’t dream high, I wouldn’t be coming to America.
If I didn’t dream high, I wouldn’t be coming to America.
A kid who was born here in America should do a lot more.
The goal for Akash would be to be a good citizen.
So whatever he does, whatever he learns, it should benefit the community,
the country, the world.
Something like, you know, Microsoft, for example. Or the Google, or the Facebook! Should be something like that,
that should change the lives of the people around the world.
We don’t know.... I mean, if it happens, we’ll be really blessed.
One of the myths, I think, that people have about Indian-Americans
and their success is that it's somehow genetic or even ethnic.
So what happened in the United States?
The Indians who do well in Spelling Bees in America
are drawn from Indians who were very adventurous,
who decided to take advantage of the relaxation of American immigration rules in 1965.
[Lyndon B. Johnson] This bill says simply that from this day forth,
those wishing to immigrate to America
shall be admitted on the basis of their skills
and their close relationships to those already here.
This is a simple test, and it is a fair test.
Those who can contribute most to this country,
to its growth, to its strength, to its spirit,
will be the first that are admitted to this land.
That stopped the relatively racist quotas on who could immigrate from where
in other parts of the world,
and it allowed for immigrants to come in from Asia, Africa, the Caribbean...
Parts of the world that had been oftentimes cut off.
It wasn’t like every South Asian was allowed in.
They picked people who were the most educated,
who could add a very clear, like, monetary value,
and serve a clear purpose for America and its economy.
[Fareed Zakaria] And Indians take advantage of this, but mostly, they are engineers, doctors.
One of the interesting things to notice is how many Indian doctors you’ll find
in very remote parts of America.
And you see them in rural Alabama or Mississippi or Louisiana,
and you ask yourself, "Why was there an Indian doctor in one of these places?"
'Cause no white person wanted to go to rural Alabama and be a doctor,
and those were the job openings that the Indians filled.
[Pawan Dhingra] Then in the '80s, and really mushrooming in the '90s
and since then, has been the growth of the IT industry.
There wasn’t conflict.
There wasn’t persecution or prosecution.
They weren’t fleeing. It was all really revolved around possibility.
So I don’t think it’s this magical Indian cultural superiority stuff I hear all the time.
A portion of the story is culture,
but a large portion is how people got here.
In addition to, like, you know, India’s a colonized country.
English was around.
[Fareed] They come to the United States.
They get trained or they go to companies. They do well.
Now, they have children,
and they want to ensure that their children
take advantage of these extraordinary opportunities that they see in America as immigrants.
[Dr. Balu Natarajan] My parents came for opportunity.
There was a lot of emphasis on language growing up inside the house,
and English was extremely stressed.
I think a lot of my interest in spelling
came because of that early exposure to English through my mom
and somewhat my dad.
It took a solid four years for me to get from start to finish
in my National Spelling Bee win pursuit,
and then eventually, in 1985, I was able to win.
[male] It was his third try at the National Spelling Bee.
Third time’s the charm!
For him this year, no bell will bing.
[Dr. Balu] I don’t think I recognized the magnitude of that probably until decades later.
And when I realized
And when I realized how relevant it was that the son of immigrants
how relevant it was that the son of immigrants
had won the National Spelling Bee
was when I saw other immigrants, primarily Indian parents,
um, say that it was 1985
that put the National Spelling Bee on the map for Indians.
And so while I never pretended that it was a big deal
other people informed me that it was a big deal to them.
[Shourav] Playing tennis and spelling are pretty similar
because it takes persistence,
because the first time you go to a match or a spelling bee, you might not win.
Because the more you practice, the better you get,
and then you can just get better and better.
And then eventually, you just...
Everything will fall into place and maybe you’ll win.
Well, I’ve been doing this for many years.
I started when I was in second grade, and every year I’ve constantly improved,
so, like, hopefully that this year will be the year.
[Usha] We are originally from India.
India has lots of languages, so I think that bilingual concept
helped them learn a lot of other languages too.
There is an expectation that he’ll do well and probably win.
Um, but also I think he’s kind of used to the pressure,
and also it’s not like a random guess.
He has proven himself that he could win the other competitions.
So that gives him the confidence.
I think he doesn’t feel that pressure so much.
[male] How good is he, really?
He's really good.
[stammers] Um...
I mean, when I was...
When I was still in eighth grade, I would say we were about equal,
but, like, since then, he’s kept on going.
I wanna say he is probably the best speller in the world.
-He's like Michael Jordan. -Obviously, Michael Jordan. Yeah.
Michael Jordan is just, like, consistently the best player in,
like, in the league when he was playing,
and I think Shourav is, like, consistently the best speller in the school,
and probably, like, in the state,
and, like, maybe, probably even the nation.
[girl] We found a word that Ashrita did not know!
[Ashrita] S-U-P-E-R-C...
...you have all day!
By the time she was two, two and a half, she was already good at solving puzzles,
and she was asking for more,
and she was able to recognize some of the letters.
And by the time she was three, she was able to read the smaller books,
the books with a few words in each sentence.
So we did not think of it as a talent.
We thought it was a normal thing
-that all kids do... -For all kids!
...and so we just continued filling her with more and more, whatever she was comfortable with.
Basically, it started a really long time ago
when I was about five.
I was in an art competition,
'cause I was kind of into art at that time,
and in the next room they had a spelling bee.
Since I was really young, they just let me in randomly.
They didn’t really think I was gonna do any good or anything.
So they’re just like, “Yeah, sure, you can do it.”
I go there, I take the tests, and I come third
out of first-through-eighth graders.
And then my parents were just like...
"Something’s up." [chuckling]
[Swapna] My brother Bharat, he’s very focused
and he has set very high goals for himself.
So the same thing I observe in Ashrita.
Ashrita has a great influence on the younger kids and also on the people way back in my hometown.
As Ashrita was getting through each year,
trying to get through Scripps, people came to know that,
"Okay, this is what is happening."
During the competitions,
we make sure that we are calling her every day,
because it’s not very easy to spell on the stage where millions of people are watching her.
Whatever may be the result, we always love her and encourage her.
-[woman singing Indian music over stereo] -[cymbal ringing]
[Tejas] The first time I thought "I want to win the Scripps Bee" was in fourth grade,
because I’d lost the county bee that year, placing second.
And then I contemplated my reasons for continuing
because I was obviously crushed,
and then that same year I watched the National Spelling Bee,
and I saw Arvind win.
And I really wanted to be in that spotlight
and I wanted to hoist that trophy over my head,
and so that’s where it started.
[Sri] I was so happy that there is a chance that exists
to entertain this kid in an area that he’s interested in.
At the same time, instill the habits
which will actually come and live with him for later in his life.
The benefit of hard work, the work ethic and all that stuff.
So I was really, really happy.
[Karthikeyan] When it comes to Tejas,
the inherent nature that, you know, that being curious
the inherent nature that, you know, that being curious to a different subject, be it medicine, to dance, to...
to a different subject, be it medicine, to dance, to...
You call it, the different ones, he’s curious.
His curiosity is what comes to my mind, which is very unique to him.
It really makes... makes us all proud.
And especially, I feel proud, and that’s where it gives an inspiration to my kid.
He looks upon to him as my brother,
and he takes a lot of inspiration from him.
So someone, like, you know, when you see someone on the TV,
especially the big platform like YouTube,
or be on a, like, you know, the ESPN.
My son, he loves to watch for hours and hours,
and naturally I see that the longer he watches those videos,
he’s getting more inspired by him.
[male pronouncer] Yes.
Scripps Howard is proud to introduce the 1988 National Spelling Bee champion
from the Sacramento Bee, Rageshree Bhag Ramachandran.
I think those who didn't have someone to look up to...
we can legitimately call trailblazers.
[Dr. Balu] As I recall, I think it was 1983.
We have a picture at home.
There are six of us.
All six of us accounted for the entire Indian contingent
in the 1983 National Spelling Bee.
That was it. Just six out of 137, I think.
[Srinivas] In the Scripps Spelling Bee in the early '90s,
I recall seeing a few Indian-American students,
certainly South Asian-American students.
It wasn’t something that felt, like, normal that there was a ton.
At the time, I think,
my eight or nine-year-old brother was the first time I realized
just potentially how big spelling bees were within this community.
He was eight years old!
And he was talking about it in these reverential terms
that made me believe that this was something that he was really motivated by.
It all changed in 1994, when ESPN first began broadcasting the Bee,
because all of a sudden,
not only could you read about it in your newspaper,
but you could just easily watch it on television.
[Srinivas] Definitely a much bigger buzz for us. It was really cool.
I mean, I was a huge basketball fan by that time.
You know, I was wearing, like, a Bulls cap at one of the picnics,
and they would ask me, like, "Who's your favorite players?"
I was like, “Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan."
[Dr. Sanjay] I’m a sports guy, I like sports, and I remember watching it on ESPN.
And I thought, "They’re showing a spelling bee on ESPN."
I mean, Indian kids have arrived, finally, you know,
with regard to sports because, you know,
sports was not an area where they were excelling as much.
But spelling was on ESPN, so, hey, it’s pretty much the same thing, right?
I remember at that point, I thought to myself, "Something’s happening here."
Before! First of all! First things first, next things next,
and without further ado, I’m going to go ahead.
And the definition is... [clicks tongue] Um, it’s a lung disease.
That’s why it’s…
"sis", "o-sis"ending.
Which is caused by inhaling ash, sand, dust…
...etcetera.
Okay, the word is 45 letters, okay? So don’t be surprised on this.
Anyways, so...
Excuse me for the moment. [exhales]
Ready, set, spell!
Yeah, I think the word just filled up the entire screen.
[Shalini Shankar] Akash Vukoti, I think, burst onto the scene
as being this phenomenon.
He’s so young, and yet he’s so poised and so competent,
and so gifted at spelling in a way that kids who are six,
I’ve never seen a child spell.
It’s fun to get all the attention. I’m not really jealous of him.
I’m just glad that he has all that media attention.
He kind of keeps me in it too,
which doesn’t make me feel left out,
and if I’m not left out, that doesn’t really make me feel jealous. [chuckles]
So, last year, Akash was Cereno Spelling Bee champion.
...T-L-Y, circumspectly.
[host] We have a new champ!
How do I win the Scripps National Spelling Bee?
The way to win the Bee is simply…
90 percent hard work!
Ten percent…
other.
[Ganesh] So this is our database of words.
The dictionary has about 475,000 words,
and what we realized is we can condense that 475,000 words
into about 125,000 words by simply removing the extensions.
So, for example, if you know "sleep," "sleeping" is not required.
So if you know these base words,
you can construct any of the remaining words in the dictionary.
[Shourav] I know probably, like, 98 to 99 percent.
That's how much accuracy you need.
[Ganesh] We haven’t seen a word which came outside this dictionary for the last four years.
If someone really masters this database,
there is a very high probability that they can win any competition,
including the Scripps Spelling Bee.
[Muthu] Tiercé.
T-I-E-R-C-E-E.
-The language of origin is French. -Yeah.
-[Muthu] So does that change your ending? -No.
-[Muthu] What did you say again? -T-I-E-R-C-E-E.
No, it’s T-I-E-R-C-E, with that accent on top.
My expectations for Tejas is, like, win the trophy
because he has put in a lot of hard work. It’s been six years' penance for him.
So he has been putting in a lot of hours, like, putting in a lot of energy into it.
He’s putting a lot of his emotions and feel into it.
[Tejas] You can’t be a champion just by putting an hour a day.
Whether it’s in sports or in spelling, you have to put in the effort.
And what you see time and time again is people who have,
more or less, devoted their whole lives to spelling
become Spelling Bee champions,
and I think that really is a testament to the benefits of hard work.
[Muthu] This is the gateway to get into Scripps National Spelling Bee.
I'm feeling excited and nervous at the same time.
Tejas has won this regional competition thrice.
Oh my gosh, I’m always a nervous wreck.
Always, always. I'm confident in his ability,
but spelling bees, it’s the luck of the draw.
One word can do it and hopefully he’ll have good words today and do well.
[host] Welcome to the 43rd Annual Richmond Times-Dispatch Regional Spelling Bee.
Thank you for joining us today. Judges, are we ready?
M-A-N...
-[bell rings] -[pronouncer] Mattock.
[whispering] Yes, yes. Phew!
[male host] All right, this is the start of round 11.
[pronouncer] Campodeiform.
Alma mater.
[quietly] Yes, yes.
[pronouncer] Okay, you'll now have to spell one additional word.
Florilegium.
Florilegium. Definition, please?
"A volume or collection of brief extracts or writings; an anthology."
Florilegium. Are there any alternate pronunciations?
There are not.
[pronouncer] Okay, we have our champion!
One more trip.
[male host] Wow, congratulations to all of our spellers.
They’re all champions.
[Tejas] I’m really happy that I managed to pull it off,
and I’m really excited that I get to go back to the National Spelling Bee for my last year,
to the National Spelling Bee for my last year,
and I’m just ready to work really hard for it.
[Tejas] I don’t really enjoy attention that much.
Whenever people compliment me, I take the compliment,
and I thank them but within me, I kind of say, "I don’t deserve it,"
because I haven’t gotten the ultimate trophy yet.
Logorrhea. May I have a sentence, please?
[male pronouncer] "The patient’s logorrhea was indicative of deep emotional problems."
I had grown up in North Carolina...
and had moved to Florida...
and had moved to Florida... and I’d never been in settings where I didn’t feel distinctly different.
and I’d never been in settings where I didn’t feel distinctly different.
For having my name, for looking the way I did,
rather unusual to be somebody who went home and did her homework
instead of hanging out after school.
Where I was really inspired
was seeing a list of the kids who were finalists in 1997,
and seeing at that point that it was a majority of Indian spellers.
And so, as an Indian student,
this felt like an arena in which I could compete and be successful.
[Nupur] In the 1999 Scripps National Finals, there were four kids of Indian origin.
And so, seeing so many Indian spellers at Scripps
gave me a sense of comfort and a sense of belonging,
and also it was the first time in my life that I didn’t feel
extremely different.
Logorrhea, L-O-G-O-R-R-H-E-A.
-[female pronouncer] That is correct. -[audience cheering, applauding]
[Pawan Dhingra] Once Nupur Lala won the 1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee,
and it was broadcast via the film Spellbound,
it really raised awareness to the entire community
about this being a niche in which Indian-American kids can excel.
Have you seen the movie Spellbound?
Oh my God, every...
Every time she has a major spelling bee or anything like that,
we have, yeah.
These are... I think we watch it, like, very often.
All the time.
[George] There’s three tips I have for other spellers.
One, trust in Jesus.
Trust and believe in Jesus.
Two, honoring your parents.
And three, hard work.
I love that. Like, he is so like, "I spell.
I’m dominant in it.
My parents, all about it.
Respect your parents, trust Jesus."
He trusted Jesus all the way to first place. [laughing]
[female pronouncer] You have won the...
Success seemed attainable, it seemed achievable,
because you had watched other Indian-Americans do it.
And I think that often when you have something like that in a community
where people can imagine the success,
it’s tangible, it’s not abstract,
they go for it and they work hard for it.
And so the success has then bred success and led to even greater success. [Ananya] E...
-Correct. -Indian-American students
have two other bees that are specifically designed for them
to foster the competition that they have amongst themselves
and to get better at spelling in front of a group,
and to collaborate with their peers on how to study, and for the parents to get together and talk about what’s working
and for the parents to get together and talk about what’s working
and what’s not working.
When I heard they were doing them, I was like, “Of course.”
This is how it’s done in the Indian-American community.
Let’s raise the stakes and let’s see what happens!
I think only when this minor league circuit of the South Asian Spelling Bee
and the North South Foundation Spelling Bee, which has been in effect for over 20 years, I believe,
that you really see these kids hone their craft
to a level that you didn’t otherwise see before that.
[Kevin Negandhi] A lot of the families approach these bees
as practice rounds, if you will, for the big Scripps Spelling Bee.
[female choreographer] Two. No feet. All right. Five, six...
So no feet. Five, six, seven, and one...
[male coach] Run in. Good. Around. And here it comes, three more.
Results are important, but we have to ignore the results
and concentrate on the process.
Enjoy the process, the results will come on their own.
[Sirisha] I’m telling Ashrita whatever is the outcome,
we don’t have so many expectations or anything. It’s fine with us.
You just, like, do your best.
We want her to be relaxed, as relaxed as she can.
Ashrita, like, when she’s relaxed,
-she can spell very tough words. -She does better.
She does better.
[Shourav] So, basically what we do is my mom or dad makes a list of words,
and then I just go over them,
and they just keep quizzing me until I get all of them right.
[Usha] Mornay.
What’s the definition?
"A cheese-flavored cream sauce."
M-O-R-N-A-Y.
[Usha] Yeah, good. Good job.
We mostly keep this as a secret, but...
[Ganesh] It’s only we are sharing this database because this is our last year,
and so far we have kept this as a family trade secret,
and that gives Shourav a competitive advantage, the way he prepares.
So, yeah, we haven’t shared with anybody else so far.
As always, I’m kind of nervous because it’s my last year,
so there’s really no room for error.
But I’m also pretty confident that I’ll do pretty good,
so we’ll just see how it goes.
[male host] The biggest spelling event in Texas starts right now.
Welcome to the 2017 Houston Public Media Spelling Bee.
We’re here today with 56 finalists.
At the end of our Bee,
only two will be going to the Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C.,
where they’ll compete to find out who is our nation’s top speller.
[male pronouncer] The word is "capsule."
Capsule. May I have the definition?
The word is "gloaming."
That is correct.
That is correct. That's correct.
-[bell rings] -[male TV host] Wow, what a difficult Bee we have been fighting so far.
If my count is right, we’re down to just four spellers.
The word is "gamapetalous."
[boy] A-L...
That is correct.
That's correct.
That's correct. That's correct. That's correct. Correct.
[male pronouncer] The word is "bardiglio."
[male pronouncer] The word is "zwitterion."
[male pronouncer] The word is "promyshlennik."
Promyshlennik. Can I have the definition?
Can I have the language of origin?
Can I have the sentence?
Wait, can I start over?
-Can you repeat the word one more time? -Promyshlennik.
That is correct.
[male TV host] Nicely done. Shourav, don’t go anywhere.
He has spelled the word correctly in his round.
There’s nobody else in his round to compete against,
so he goes on to a championship word. If he gets this correct,
then he’s our champion. If not, the Bee continues.
Here we go.
The word is "rafraichissoir."
[male pronouncer] I guess he was pretty proud of that spelling!
I just won the Houston Public Media Regional Spelling Bee
and I’m feeling pretty good about it. [chuckles]
I just knew it off the top of my head and I...
I’m just like, why not just get it over with right then and there,
so I just spelled it, like, in two seconds flat.
We expected him to win, and he won in that sense, uh...
-It's a good turnout. -Yeah, it’s... It’s the expected outcome.
[Shourav] I’m just really happy and really proud, I guess,
just to be going back and representing Houston again.
I was talking with a past champion,
and of course I asked her the most obvious question,
“Why do you think so many Indians  win the Bees?”
And she said, for her, one of the key reasons is that languages
is something that her family and herself just know so much about.
Her parents were fluent in five languages,
and while that’s a lot, being multilingual is commonplace.
And the familiarity of language,
the ability to communicate so fluently across multiple languages,
helps the kids in their minds grasp words,
grasp spelling, grasp languages, nuances, its etymologies,
and that helps them achieve in the Bee.
[Krishna] Akash can fluently read-write three languages.
Mother tongue, English. Mother’s mother tongue, Telugu. And then Hindi, which is India’s national language.
And then Hindi, which is India’s national language.
-So he’s fluent in three languages. Yeah. -Yeah, he can read and write.
[Krishna] And he is really looking into learn other languages,
like, you know, German or Hebrew or Korean.
To be a winner, you probably need to master 60 to 100 thousand words.
You also need to understand patterns from different languages.
You also need to understand patterns from different languages. You need to study old Bees,
You need to study old Bees,
and one of the things we haven’t talked about
is you’ve got to be able to stand on stage and think on your feet
and present these words without getting distracted
or getting flustered, and think through what the word means,
and you’ve got a limited time clock to do this. It’s a huge amount of work.
Most of these students spend one to two hours a day, all week,
every week, and then more on the weekends,
and they do this for years leading up to the National Bee.
Some of these students start on this
as young as three and four years old in some of these families.
These kids have put more time into spelling by the time they’re 13
than most of us put into anything our entire lives.
[Pawan Dhingra] The popular misconception of these families
is that they are "tiger parents,"
who are drilling their kids, forcing them to study against their will.
How else can you explain why so many Indian children
are excelling in this one particular niche?
To be honest, when children are young,
parents do typically enroll their kids in a spelling bee or some other academic competition,
the same way that parents enroll their children
into basketball or swimming without asking their kids' permission,
hoping that their kids will like it and get good at something.
But the kids don’t stick with it unless they like it,
and the parents don’t force their kids to become spellers
unless the kids find some internal drive for it.
[Dr. Balu] The Spelling Bee was something I wanted to do.
I didn’t get intense pressure from home to do it.
In fact, after losing out in 1984 in the National Spelling Bee,
my parents said, “Do you really want to do this again?”
I thought about it and I said, “Yes, I do want to pursue it again.”
[Dr. Sanjay] This is a metaphor for something else, a metaphor for success,
it’s a metaphor for "I have achieved something
and received recognition within my own community,"
and the motivations would be the same as anything else in life.
Mmm! Let’s begin round one of the Vukoti Spelling Bee. Let's go.
Number one.
[Kevin Negandhi] When you watch the Bee,
the first thing you think of is
it’s a family affair throughout the whole process.
[Akash] Accommodate.
A-C-C-O-M-M-O-D-A-T-E.
-Accommodate. -[Krishna] Good job.
When a parent devotes a lot of time
to coaching a student through a spelling competition,
the siblings are there.
They’re listening to it, learning it, picking it up,
and there’s usually some competition among the siblings.
Their parents have already figured out by the time you get to the second sibling
how to help that speller learn and practice
in a much more refined and efficient way.
When the older one won the district spelling bee, the younger one,
who’s three years younger than him,
wrote down every word correctly in the district bee that everybody got. So, you know, he’s...
He’s in second grade. [laughing]
[Shourav] I got into it in second grade,
and that was when Shobha was in fourth grade,
so we had just really started that year 'cause, like,
that was the year that Shobha won her first school spelling bee,
so then my parents just started helping her from there.
[Ganesh] Initially, we thought he would be a good pronouncer,
because some of the words we were not able to pronounce the way Shobha wanted.
So we recruited him as a pronouncer to Shobha,
and then he realized that, "Oh, I can just not be the pronouncer,
I can be the best speller too and I can beat my sister too."
So I think that’s how it started, and after that he took off.
[Shobha] We were really competitive with each other,
but it was kind of like a balance.
Like, we’d be really competitive at a bee
and we wouldn’t talk to each other, that kind of thing.
Or I would talk to him, but he wouldn’t talk to me.
And then, once we got home, it was fine though.
We’d sit in the game room and play video games and, like... that kind of thing.
I don’t think there was a moment where he, like, questioned why he was doing it.
He just knew he wanted to win, and so he, like... he just went for it,
and I really admire that about him.
I’ve been doing it for such a long time,
and it’s something that I really enjoy.
And to be the best at it, that would be, like, a really surreal experience.
Now, I’ll research more things about this.
I just like going to Wikipedia and reading about stuff 'cause I like reading.
I can connect it to spelling in a way, because hali-ya, blah-blah-blah,
which is a scientific name for a bald eagle.
It actually comes from the Greek, hali meaning "sea," aetos meaning "eagle,"
leuko meaning "white," and suphlos meaning "head."
And they all squish it together.
So I just want to do further research into that.
If I see a new word, like in school, maybe...
Maybe one day, my teacher uses the word "finagle,"
I’m like, “What does finagle mean?” I look it up.
And maybe, in the word "finagle,’" I see the word "persifleur,’"
then maybe I’ll research that.
And then maybe in that entry, I find a different word.
And in that entry, I find a different word.
And I research all of them, and then that’s how I expand my vocab.
[male] Akash, are you excited for tomorrow?
Yeah! I’m really excited!
Yeah! I’m really excited! But I’m also kind of nervous at the same time.
I want you to go through one more time all the etymology things, okay?
-Yep. -You got the necessary words in this list.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, should we do it?
Long "iya" and a plural noun, spelled "ae,"
as in algae, larvae...
Wait, larvae?
Antennae.
So you know all these words' spellings, right? -[Akash] Mm-hmm. -Yes or no?
-[Chandrakala] So can I go to next page? -Go ahead.
-Cirrhosis. You wrote-- -[Akash] Cirrhosis. [Chandrakala] Mm-hmm.
-C-I... -[Chandrakala] Mm-hmm. ...R-R-H-O-S-I-S.
-Cirrhosis. -Good job!
If at all Akash continues his interest in the spellings
in the same way like what he has now,
we expect him to win the National Spelling Bee title,
like, in three to four years, by sixth grade.
like, in three to four years, by sixth grade. If he can become the national champion,
he’ll be blessed and all of us would be blessed.
[female host] Contestants, if you will please rise.
We’re going to say the Pledge of Allegiance before we get started.
[all] I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.
[male] We all set? Let’s roll.
Stucco.
Is... Are there any other alternate pronunciations, please?
May I have the language of origin, please? May I have the definition, please?
May I have the sentence, please?
[male pronouncer] "Akash spent weeks finishing a large collage of a Paris street scene."
[exaggerated deep voice] And then there were four. The final four.
This word has a homonym.
The word is "boarders."
It is a noun,
and it’s "people who are provided with regular meals
or regular meals and lodging."
May I have the alternate pronunciations, please?
[male] There are none.
May I have the language of origin, please?
[male] This word consists of two originally English parts.
Can you please repeat the word again?
Good luck to all my fellow spellers. I hope I’ll come back next year.
[Amrita] He's still young and he has a lot of years,
so he might learn some new words.
I’ve heard of that word before,
but I’ve heard it many times when I was older.
'Cause when I was his age, I had no idea what that word is.
[Krishna] Akash, you're in second grade.
Yeah, you've got so many more chances to go.
-[Akash sobbing] -That's okay.
[Krishna] "The question over there was who would be going to Washington, D.C.,
representing our region. That was the only question over there.
You may or may not be the regional champion,
but you’re already the school champion,
and, you know, on the way to prepare for this Spelling Bee,
you improved your knowledge. That’s the purpose of why the Scripps National Spelling Bee is there,
and we are on the way.
One day, you may get the National Spelling Bee trophy."
So that’s what we said. He understood it. You can see a smile on his face now.
[Krishna chuckling] That was only for, you know, a brief time,
and, you know, that’s very... quite natural for a kid.
If it isn't obvious yet, I love the Spelling Bee.
If it isn't obvious yet, I love the Spelling Bee. Or as I like to call it, the Indian Super Bowl.
Or as I like to call it, the Indian Super Bowl.
Six winners in a row! Six in a row, son!
-That’s incredible! -[audience laughing, cheering]
So it gives me great pleasure to finally say,
“Hey, white people, learn the language.”
Writing that piece, I got to put together all the reasons I loved it.
Like, here was something that we were dominant in...
that had never been seen before.
And it's spelling!
But, of course,
the internet would not let me enjoy this completely.
One patriot tweeted,
“America has to step it up with our spelling game.
Last three remaining, all of Indian decent.”
First of all, these kids of Indian descent are also American.
-[man] Woo! -Secondly, you spelled "descent" wrong!
The kid who won that year was Arvind Mahankali, who was from Queens.
It was a big deal to me,
both as a Queens resident and as an Indian-American.
These kids are amazing, and they know it!
I mean, look how cool Arvind is winning the title.
That is so G! That is so G!
Little homie didn’t even care that he won!
He looks like he’s still waiting for the next word!
And I’m like, "Why can’t we celebrate that?
Why can’t we celebrate the fact that this kid did something and he did it in such a cool way?"
that this kid did something and he did it in such a cool way?"
He reached the mountain top of that particular sport.
So, yeah, I wanted to celebrate that.
Luckily, I got to do that in a very ridiculous way.
[Pawan Dhingra] For those of us who are not in the Bees, what we see online,
the racist or xenophobic comments critiquing Indians who win,
it's very disparaging and it’s very disheartening.
And we worry about the families and, of course, about the kids themselves.
[Shalini Shankar] When you have an activity that's so explicitly branded
as a quintessentially American contest,
the idea of who gets to be named as an American
and who is considered a legitimate champion in that arena
is really coded still by whiteness,
and there’s a real emphasis on America ultimately remaining a white country.
I dread the day when "somebody else" wins the Spelling Bee,
because it'll make me sad, the kind of commentary that comes out of that.
And it’s the kind of commentary about taking something back that…
It is endemic to so much of our national debate right now
in such a misguided way.
For years, our representation was dictated by other people.
We were forced to play convenience store owners
or we were forced to play cab drivers.
Like, there was a limited range of representation. Like, film and TV, you know, especially when you’re such a small minority,
affect how the whole country or the whole world views you.
And these kids, like, they earn their way on television by succeeding.
Only in New York City could a child of Indian immigrants,
who speaks Spanish and Telugu,
compete for a trophy named for a British-American newspaper publisher,
and win the competition for spelling a Yiddish word.
I’ve actually been kvelling all day.
Do you know how to spell "kvelling"? -Yeah, I figured. -[all laughing]
That's correct. We have a champion!
...O-U-S.
Fatuous.
[male producer] Correct!
...K-A.
Zubrowka.
There you go!
[Tejas] This is my lucky purple rock.
His fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Gribben, she has given him that rock.
[Tejas] We keep it in here just to keep it really safe
because when I’m spelling, I don’t feel as confident
when I’m not carrying this rock.
So I always ensure that it’s safe and sound.
They’re treated like diamonds at my household where...
Especially during Bee season.
I know I might not really show it, but I’m just like…
I can’t describe it in words. I’m that excited!
A few years ago, when I was in first grade,
all I did was win my school and I participated in the regionals.
Now, I’m actually going to the Scripps. I mean, that feeling is just great for me.
We have been waiting for this for the past two years.
Now it finally came true.
Oh, we heard so many exciting things about the Bee Week.
Ah, we’re really excited to go and be there!
Like, you know, my kid is going to be there on the ESPN,
so I can’t just like, yeah…
My goal? I’m studying really hard to be at least in the top 50,
but I’m not expecting to do better than that because I...
I just really want to be in the top 50. That’s all I want to do this year.
[Usha] Scripps National Spelling Bee is in ten days,
so Shourav is almost done with the reviewing.
Now, these ten days,
he will go through the dictionary words one more time.
It’s kind of surreal, I guess,
because, like, I’ve been doing it for so long, it’s just like...
You've only... I only have ten more days and then I’m done with it, so…
It’s just kind of, like, just do all you can because... Well, in ten days, you’ll be done with it,
so you don’t have to worry about it anymore.
I just have, like, a few words here and there that I don’t know,
so I think I’m pretty confident that whatever happens then I’ll just be happy with it.
So these are diacritical marks, and that’s how, like,
the pronouncers at Bees read the words off the list that they have.
That’s how I also read the words for the database.
I just see the diacriticals and I can read it like a second language,
and then I type it.
Usually, if it’s a word that I’m, like, 100 percent confident about,
I can, like... While I’m typing it, I can just look at the next word,
so that’s how I can go so fast.
After, like, years of doing it, it just kind of becomes second nature.
So, I’m about to just type and see how many words I can type in a minute if I just go as fast as I can, so…
-So, three, two, one. -[stopwatch beeps]
Yeah, so that’s…
I just finished the one minute and I did 45 words in that minute.
Saying it out loud takes, like, probably five to ten seconds.
Typing a word takes, like, two seconds... two to three seconds.
So it’s just... It just goes faster for the same effect,
so I think typing is, like, the better way.
We have, like, a root word document, and I study 100 root words
and I take a two-minute break, and then I study another 100,
take a two-minute break.
But I’m just trying to study as much as I can without cramming.
She has studied well. She has worked hard for the whole year.
All she can do is do her best and I’m sure she’ll do her best.
[Tejas] My plan is just to study for confidence,
so I can go on stage thinking,
"Okay, I’ve studied all the words I can.
Now, it’s just up to the word I get and up to my stage performance."
It’s not exactly religious, but we follow a scripture
called Bhagavad Gita, where it says,
"Do your duty. There are so many things out of your control,
and don’t focus on the results."
And that’s something we have always been telling Tejas,
not just for Spelling Bee, for his life. I mean, for his studies, for his academics, for his job,
and I think he’ll be looking forward to find his new adventure
and move on to his new interests.
[Shourav] I’m pretty relaxed, I’d have to say,
but there’s always, like, a bit of nerves involved.
But I think I’ve been here, like, four times before, five including now,
so I think I’m pretty familiar with everything.
So I think I’m just relaxed and just ready to go.
[Usha] I think Shourav has a winning chance of about 90 percent.
We are going with the hope that he will be the champion,
but if there is any one or two percent chance
of not getting the championship,
that is fine because it is another year.
[female host] We are now ready to begin round two of the 2017 Scripps National Spelling Bee
presented by Kindle.
Speller number one, Naomi Zarin, you may approach the microphone.
-[Dr. Jacques Bailly] Hi, Naomi. -Hi.
[Dr. Jacques Bailly] Your word is "politeia."
Can I have the definition?
Your word is "embezzlement."
Can I have the language of origin?
Savoyard, or savo-yard,
or savoy-ar, or savoy-yard.
Could you please repeat the word?
[Dr. Jacques Bailly] Filipendulous.
[female host] Correct.
[female host] Correct.
[female host] Correct.
[female host] Correct.
[female host] Correct.
[female host] Correct.
[female host] Correct.
[female host] That's correct.
[female host] Correct.
[female host] Correct.
-Correct. -[Dr. Jacques Bailly] Repudiate.
-Could you please sing it in a song? -[Dr. Bailly laughing]
You don't want to hear that. [chuckles]
[female host] Correct.
[female host] Correct.
[female host] Correct.
Look, Dr. Bailly, you really need to come through for me right now, okay?
-Correct. -[audience applauding]
[female host] That concludes round three and the preliminaries
of the 2017 Scripps National Spelling Bee presented by Kindle.
[male host] Here are your 2017 Scripps National Spelling Bee finalists.
From Huntsville, Alabama, speller 36, Erin Howard.
From North Andover, Massachusetts, speller number 214, Ashrita Gandhahari.
[male host] From St. Johns, Florida, speller number 167, Sreeniketh Vogoti.
A face you’ve seen before from Glen Allen, Virginia, number 143, Tejas Muthusamy.
From Bainbridge, New York, speller number nine, Melodie Loya.
From Spring, Texas, number 254, Shourav Dasari.
I know they’re excited
at Fugman Elementary in Fresno, California, for speller number 264, Ananya Vinay.
for speller number 264, Ananya Vinay.
[male host] And our final finalist for 2017,
from Edmond, Oklahoma, number 235, Rohan Rajeev.
[male host] Once again, everyone, all of these young spellers
are our 2017 Scripps National Spelling Bee finalists.
Congratulations, you guys. Great job!
That standing ovation is for you.
[Kevin Negandhi] The one thing you notice about Thursday morning is the level of difficulty,
completely different from what we witnessed on Wednesday.
-[Dr. Jacques Bailly] Hi, Melodie. -[timidly] Hi.
[Dr. Bailly] Should we do this?
No.
Purlieu, or per-lew.
[female host] Correct.
Are there any alternate pronunciations?
[Dr. Jacques Bailly] Chryselephantine.
-[female host] That is correct. -[audience applauding]
-[female] Correct. -Thank you.
-Hi. -[Dr. Bailly] Hi, Ashrita.
-[Dr. Bailly] Elidible. -Elidible?
[Dr. Bailly] Elidible.
Could I have the definition?
"Capable of being passed over or suppressed."
[Ashrita] Could I have the language of origin?
It’s made up of originally Latin parts.
-Elidible? -[Dr. Bailly] Elidible.
Elidible.
[Dr. Jacques Bailly] Elidible.
-Elidible is spelled E-L-I-D-I-B-L-E. -Thank you.
[Ashrita] Okay, so I misspelled a word up there.
I feel like I really overcomplicated it.
I didn’t really get really sad over it 'cause I have, like, four more years.
I did really good, I did my best, and I don’t really mind, so...
We are extremely proud of my daughter’s achievements.
She made it so far. We are definitely going to come back next year.
[Bharat] For the first-timer, for a fourth-grader, tying for 40th spot
is more than what we expected her to do this year,
so she did an awesome job.
[Kevin Negandhi] The competition is not so much about this kid on stage versus this kid.
It’s this kid versus a dictionary of a half a million words.
At that point, I wanna go up there and give them a high five and be like,
"Yeah, you kicked butt here to get here."
People worry about competition.
They don’t wanna keep score in anything intellectual in the U.S.
Oh, we keep score in sports but nothing intellectual.
Here, we can keep score intellectually
and realize that it doesn’t put down somebody
just because one person wins.
It’s a celebration of learning.
[girl] Artiad.
[female host] That is correct.
-Warison. -Warison. Can I have the spelling, please?
-You almost got me. -[all laughing]
I don’t know if I can ask this,
but does this contain the French word boudin meaning sausage?
-[Dr. Bailly] Yes. -Okay.
[female host] Correct.
Corriedale. Kari-dale.
[girl] May I please have the definition?
"A member of a breed of rather large, usually hornless sheep
developed in New Zealand from several different breeds."
[Dr. Jacques Bailly] Corriedale is spelled C-O-R-R-I-E-D-A-L-E.
[Dr. Jacques Bailly] Virement.
[female host] Correct.
[female] That's correct.
[female] Correct.
-[gasps] Yes! -[audience laughing]
-That is correct. -Yes!
-Correct. -Thank you.
-Correct. -Thank you.
[female] Correct. Correct. Correct. Correct. Correct.
-Correct. -Thank you.
[female host] That concludes round seven.
Spellers, you're going to be on ESPN tonight.
Congratulations, spellers.
[Shourav] I’m really excited since it’s something
that I’ve been working hard for for a long time.
I just finally get to be a part of the night finals on ESPN.
I’m gonna brag to my friends.
I’m gonna be on ESPN, I don’t need to be an athlete or anything.
What I loved about Shourav is that there was...
there was flavor to the whole thing.
And there’s nothing wrong with having that type of flavor.
I mean, when you’re wearing the lucky Nike hoodie
that’s carried you through this whole thing.
He’s on stage and halfway through the word,
he starts to have that little smile, like he knew.
He knew it was a big event and he was confident!
It also separated him from other people because each time up, you’re like,
"All right, where’s the guy? Where’s the guy in the hoodie?
Where is Shourav?”
And I think that was a cool element to have in the program.
[Tejas] It worked well.
I definitely got words that I knew or was able to derive.
In each round, there’s probably one or two words
In each round, there’s probably one or two words that I didn’t recognize at first that other people got,
and so I would consider myself pretty lucky.
I’m just going to look over a couple of words
just to get my mind in the zone and...
Relax, maybe meditate a little bit.
I’m not sure if I’ll have time for that, but definitely relax
and soak in the experience because I know next year
I’m not going to be able to have it, no matter what happens.
And then we get to the final 15
and you can’t ignore what we’re looking at:
thirteen Indian-Americans.
[Kevin Negandhi] We now begin round eight, the prime time finals,
and to start things off,
the 1980 Bee champion Dr. Jacques Bailly is our pronouncer,

[Dr. Bailly] Saussurite is spelled S-A-U-S-S-U-R-I-T-E.
Thank you.

[in English] I'm very proud of you. Whatever happened, I'm very proud of you.
You'll always be my champion. [speaks Tamil]
[Dr. Bailly] Mogollon.
-[audience gasping] -Correct.
[Kevin Negandhi] Then you’re watching Shourav
and you see this extreme confidence on the stage.
At that point, you feel like he has all the makings,
and the one thing that stood out was how quickly he got that one word, within five seconds,
but everybody in the room felt like, "That’s the guy."
Ubaid.
Can I have the definition?
"Of or relating to an early Bronze Age culture in Mesopotamia prior to 3000 BCE."

[Kevin Negandhi] It comes down to two, two students that were unflappable.
Ananya on one side, the sixth grader.
And then Rohan, the 14-year-old, who’s never been here before.
First time on this stage in this setting.
And you couldn’t tell!
They were both locked in.

Are there any alternate pronunciations?
[Dr. Bailly] There are not.
Can you please repeat the word?
[Dr. Bailly] Marocain.
-That is correct. -Congratulations, Ananya!
-[audience cheering] -[Dr. Bailly] You are the champion!
[male 1] Ananya,
this is yours.
Congratulations, you're the 2017 champion of the Scripps National Spelling Bee.
The trend of Indian-American success in the Bee is long-running,
and I think it’s going to continue in that direction
for the unforeseeable future.
[male 2] Congratulations, Karthik. You are the 2018 Scripps National Spelling Bee Champion!
You are the 2018 Scripps National Spelling Bee Champion!
[male] The most phenomenal assemblage of super-spellers in the history of this storied competition.
It’s never gonna be all Indian.
We have plenty of other students who are competing,
but they are highly successful, they are having fun with it,
and they are winning. I don’t see it changing anytime soon.
The only way Indian-American kids are losing the Spelling Bee
is if they switch to Spanish next year.
And then it’s still, like, 50/50.
I think that this is in part a reflection of this particular time in our history,
and some of the values that have been instilled, I think, by Indian immigrants on their kids.
The relentless and, I think, you know, for the most part, constructive focus
on education for these kids,
and the fact that spelling in particular ended up fulfilling all these aspirations
of these parents for their kids.
[Dr. Sanjay Gupta] As generations go on, you may see less of a focus on things like Spelling Bees
you may see less of a focus on things like Spelling Bees
and hopefully more of a focus on other areas as well.
Things that may not necessarily be purely academic,
but other areas where kids are interested in and want to excel.
So I think you’ll see a sort of more broadening out
of particularly Indian-American kids’ interests.
[Hari Kondabolu] The Spelling Bee playing every year on television,
I think it certainly inspires lots of South Asian kids, Indian-American kids
to take up spelling as a thing.
But it’s also getting a bunch of other kids into it too that aren’t South Asian.
Tiger Woods, most of his heroes in golf would’ve been white, right?
Like, for the most part? Like, considering what the sport is?
Yet that inspired him to achieve,
so who’s to say that there isn’t some, like, kid in the middle of America, who’s, like, brown or black or Latino,
isn’t a huge Arvind Mahankali-head.
That’s, like, the dude he looked up to when he was a kid,
and now wants to win.
[Fareed] But the truth is, I think, what these kids show more than anything else is American assimilation at work.
Here are kids who really come from a very different world and culture
in their historical and cultural origins,
and they are taking part in the most American tradition,
doing well at it, playing by the rules.
If that’s not American assimilation at work, I don’t know what is.
[Kevin Negandhi] We are part of this DNA, this melting pot, uh, cliché.
And it’s not a cliché, we are part of it.
And to have ownership of one thing,
in the sense of that we can dominate something, it’s pretty cool,
considering there’s just one percent of the population of Indian-Americans.
So to me, when I say that, I say that as a joke, like,
"Yes! We own this!"
Because it’s a small thing,
but it means so much to so many people in our community.
[Dr. Gupta] It just was the perfect storm. And I think Spelling Bees,
I mean, that became the Olympics for so many Indians.
I just need to say it slowly.
[Krishna] You got it.
Humu humu, you just say "humu humu," and then you say "nuku nuku,"
Hannah.
Hannah.
Hannah.
No.
God himself commands you,
depart from the body of Hannah Grace, you demon,
along with every satanic power of the enemy,
along with every specter from hell.
Stop!
Hannah, I know you're in there.
You have to fight, baby.
Fight it, Hannah.
Fight it. Fight it, Hannah.
[SOBBING] You have to fight.
Baby, it's me.
Dad. Daddy's here, baby.
Dad. Honey. Baby.
Dad.
[STUTTERING] You have to fight.
In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son,
in the name of the Holy Spirit.
Hannah, stop!
No.
DEMON: Your whore daughter is mine.
She's mine forever.
Forgive me.
LISA [ON VOICE MAIL]: Meg. Hey, it's Lisa. I just talked to Dr. Lewis and you're good to go, so maybe you can
and you're good to go, so maybe you can come in this afternoon. Okay, bye.
Hey.
You look nervous. Are you okay?
It's a job interview. I think I'm supposed to be nervous.
Okay. Come on, let's go get a coffee.
LISA: This will be good.
We'll go to meetings in the morning after our shifts end
and I'll be three floors up, so if you need anything...
You know?
Thank you for this.
Don't thank me yet. You still have to meet Dr. Lewis.
DR. LEWIS: This job is not for everyone.
We've had three overnight intake assistants in the last six months alone.
Because of the hours? No, because it's a thankless, solitary position.
The smell. You never get used to the smell.
I was a cop. I'm totally used to bad smells.
Lisa mentioned that there were issues.
Yes. There were issues. But I'm much better now.
Well, she assured me that you could handle the job.
Is it something you think you can handle? I can handle it.
COMPUTER: Going down.
It gets to you after a while, being here. People get creeped out.
Before you know it, their imaginations are running wild,
they're hearing things go bump in the night.
Not me.
I believe when you die, you die.
End of story.
Good.
COMPUTER: Arrived at morgue.
At night, you can't get in or out without swiping this card.
If you lose it, hospital security has to let you in.
They will not be happy.
Most of the lights are on a sensor. The rest you have to switch on manually.
There are a lot of files that need to be entered into the system.
I hope you don't mind data entry. No, not at all.
Men's room is down there, women's room is down there,
and down there to the left is the incinerator room for cremation.
COMPUTER: Intake bay.
DR. LEWIS: This intake bay is for drop-offs only.
No drop-off, no access.
And you never leave the premises while you're on duty. No exceptions.
[CHIMES] COMPUTER: Arrived at morgue.
Well, you bring the cadaver up from the intake bay,
and take it into the receiving room, which is over here.
COMPUTER: Image captured.
First you take an overview of the body and then close-ups
of each individual injury.
COMPUTER: Image captured. All right, you try.
Rigor mortis makes a corpse difficult to fingerprint.
Now, if you press on the knuckle, it will extend
the finger, and make it easier to handle.
Gently roll.
COMPUTER: Scanning.
This doohickey sends the prints to a crime database.
Green means they're ready to go. Red means they're not.
Yeah.
Green...
Green means go.
Thanks, Moe. You bet, Doc.
The shift starts tomorrow night at 11, goes to 7 in the morning.
Any problems with that? Not at all.
Well, thank you for the opportunity.
I promise you won't be disappointed.
Welcome to the team.
Thanks.
Hey, do you need to see my I.D.?
Do you work here? In the morgue. I'm Megan.
Then no.
Hey, I'm Dave.
Megan. Nice to meet you.
And, you know, welcome to the graveyard shift.
Thanks.
COMPUTER: Morgue.
COMPUTER: Intake bay.
COMPUTER: Arrived at intake bay.
Who are you? Where's Larry?
I don't know who Larry is, but I'm Megan.
COMPUTER: Morgue.
You've got to be the right kind to stomach a job like this.
Personally...
I'm not what you'd call a people person.
Dead's the way I like them.
COMPUTER: Image captured.
COMPUTER: Scanning.
Green means go.
Hey. [GASPS]
Goddamn it, Dave. Sorry.
Not funny.
I didn't mean to. I honestly just came down to check on you.
Shit. I feel like an asshole. Forgive me?
I'll never do it again.
Really not funny.
Hey.
MAN 1: Why didn't you shoot me? MAN 2: Megan, do something.
MEGAN: I don't know what triggers it, really.
A lot of things, I guess.
But I still have nightmares of what happened.
Put your hands up!
Me just...
standing there...
doing nothing.
I just freeze up and I can't move.
MAN [ON RADIO]: Officer down. Officer down.
It's okay. I've got you. I've got you.
I want it so bad sometimes.
The drink and the pills, I want them so bad.
Thank you, Megan, for sharing.
MAN: Hey.
I just, um, need the rest of my stuff.
My shift just ended, but if this is a bad time...
No. No, come in.
And you're still in your pajamas because...?
I started a new job last night. A night job.
That's great.
Doing what?
Overnight intake assistant at the morgue.
It's better than it sounds.
Yeah, I'm basically running the place at night, all on my own.
Are you sure that's a good idea, you know...
spending so much time alone right now?
Actually, I do. You know, it keeps me from going out at night
doing things I might regret in the morning.
It worked for Lisa and she thinks it could work for me, too.
"Lisa"? My AA sponsor.
The nurse at the hospital.
She says it keeps her out of trouble working the night shift.
So, when a job opened up at the morgue, she thought of me.
Yeah, still, too much time alone is never good for anyone.
Says the guy who moved out.
You didn't give me much of a choice.
That's not true, Andrew. You know that's not true.
Since when are you concerned about the truth?
I didn't come to...
I should go.
COMPUTER: Intake bay.
COMPUTER: Arrived at intake bay.
I forgot my key. Could you open the door?
You don't work here.
Yes, I do. Just let me in.
Sir, back away from the door. No. No. No.
Sir. Let me in!
I'm going to call security. Back away from the door.
COMPUTER: Morgue. MAN: Let me in!
Let me in!
MAN [ON PHONE]: Security.
Hey, I had a homeless guy at the intake bay.
MAN: Thanks for the heads-up. Yeah, we get that a lot.
Yeah.
COMPUTER: Arrived at intake bay.
Drop-off? Hey, yeah.
Ooh. You're new here.
Megan. Randy.
Could you give me a hand? I'm all alone tonight.
Sorry. I can't leave the premises.
Yes. Yeah. Stickler on the rules.
But I'll tell you right now,
if you don't help me get this thing inside,
it's going to start to rot and decay. It's just going to blow up like a puffer fish.
And then we're both going to lose our jobs.
Unless...
What do you think? All right, okay. Fine.
Yeah? Yeah.
You're the best. My partner called in sick. Strep throat.
Which is 100 percent grade-A bullshit because--
Do you want to grab that side? Yeah.
He is holing up with his psycho ex-girlfriend.
It seems like he should be making some new friends.
Yeah, I think he should probably pick a better psycho ex-girlfriend next time.
So, I want to say thank you, by the way,
because the guy who used to have this job would never have just done that.
He was a prick. Horrendous breath.
How long have you been here? I just started.
COMPUTER: Arrived at morgue.
MEGAN: What happened? RANDY: Oh, yeah, it's a bad one.
The cops found her in an alley. One, two, three.
[GRUNTING] Yeah.
Yeah, so the guy was still slicing her.
He took off. They still haven't found him.
Did they find out who he was? No clue.
"Hannah Grace."
Yeah, that's what it said on her I.D.
I told you it was bad.
That's not even the insane thing. The insane thing is
they found chloroform by her body.
What kind of a lunatic drugs a girl, smashes her head in,
and then tries to burn her body after she's been dead?
I'll tell you who it is. It's someone trying to send a message.
It could have been her pimp. It might have been a drug dealer.
It could have been a sex thing.
Thanks, Randy. I can take it from here. You got it. Yeah.
All right.
Thanks for the help, Megan.
Yeah.
COMPUTER: Intake bay. It gets easier. I promise.
Thanks.
It's all part of the job.
COMPUTER: Error. Unable to load image.
COMPUTER: Error.
Unable to load image.
Okay.
What?
COMPUTER: Error. Unable to load image.
All right.
"Username."
Megan Reed.
"Password."
Bye-bye, Megan.
Andrew Kurtz.
"Password."
Megan.
"DL: 08162014."
Brown.
Get out of here.
You're losing your mind.
It's freaking hot.
Dave?
Dave, you promised.
Dave!
Oh, my God.
If you scream, I will have to slit your throat.
Do you understand? Yes.
Do you understand?
Come on. MAN [ON PHONE]: Security.
There's someone down here. Call the police now.
MAN: What? [PHONE SLAMS CRADLE]
MAN: "As we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil."
Stop. Put the body down.
I've already called security. There's nowhere for you to go.
Now, just stay calm. You don't understand.
DAVE: Megan!
Megan!
Megan!
Get off of me! Get off of me!
Please, listen to me!
You've got to destroy her body. GUARD: Get him up!
You're coming with us. Please, listen to me.
MAN: Listen. Listen. GUARD: Are you okay?
You have to destroy her body. You've got to destroy her body.
You don't know what you've done!
You don't know what you-- She's not dead!
DAVE: Stop.
Hello?
ANDREW [ON PHONE]: Megan, it's Andrew. I just heard what happened. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, but I'm going to have to call you back.
Hey, can you open the door?
Hey. Are you okay?
Did that guy hurt you? No. No, not really.
[SIGHS] I'm fine. Do you want to call it a night?
I can find someone else to cover your shift.
I'm okay. Seriously, Lisa, I'm fine.
Nobody is going to hold it against you if you just want to get out of here.
I know. But I want to stay. Okay? I can do this. I want to do this.
But you don't have to. Lisa.
I need to do this.
Okay.
What is it?
I know this is going to sound insane, but...
I heard a corpse breathe.
Breathe? Yes.
Like...
an exhale.
Corpses expunge air sometimes when they're moved.
Dr. Lewis didn't tell you this?
In his defense, he...
probably assumed I was smart enough to know that corpses can't breathe.
Are you hungry?
I can get us some take-out from the cafeteria.
Sure. Okay, come on.
You know, when that guy attacked me tonight...
my first instinct wasn't to run.
You know, I wanted to defend myself,
to stop him.
I didn't freeze.
Why couldn't I have done that when there was a gun pointed at my partner?
And then none of this would have happened.
Look, it's just one step at a time.
This job is the next step.
Hey. Hey.
There is a cop upstairs who wants to talk to you.
I can cover down here if you want. Yeah. Yeah, okay.
How's your arm? Oh, it's good as new.
Do you want some fries? Um...
Sure. Thanks. LISA: Here. See you.
You didn't have to come here. They already have my statement.
Yeah, I know. I was in the area.
Are you okay? He didn't hurt you?
Just my ego. Did you I.D. him yet?
No, he's not talking.
We'll know more once we get him to the station.
You seem anxious.
Are you staying through the night?
That's the plan.
I just know how you get when you're stressed.
Okay, look, I appreciate you coming here, but I've got things covered.
Okay?
Is there something else?
I know this isn't the right time...
but when I picked up my stuff, there was something missing.
A bottle of Xanax.
And you're assuming that I...
what, stole them from you?
Did you? [SCOFFS] It's a valid question.
You're not supposed to be around controlled medications of any kind.
controlled medications of any kind. You misplace a bottle of pills and automatically assume this.
Why are you getting so defensive? I'm not getting defensive. I'm getting pissed.
I'm not getting defensive. I'm getting pissed.
You know, it's as if you're completely incapable of giving me the benefit of the doubt.
If you ever need my help, I'm just a call away. Okay?
Actually, there is something you can help me with. I'll be right back.
Hey.
How's it going? I'm good. How are you?
I'll just be another minute if that's okay. Yeah, no problem. Take your time.
Bases loaded, three-and-two count, down by three.
The stakes could not be higher.
Here comes the pitch. It's a heater.
It's a grand slam!
Can you run these for me at the station?
The scanner broke down before I could run her prints.
Her? Hannah Grace.
ANDREW: You already have her I.D.
I think that I.D. is fake. The picture on her license doesn't match.
Her eye color, it's different.
What? Once a cop...
Just get me the prints, okay?
You got it.
Dave?
I mean, seriously.
Dave?
Dave?
Hello?
Dave, is that you?
Are you sure you gave me the right prints?
Positive. The results are odd.
Why do you say that?
Because according to the prints, Hannah Grace has been dead for three months.
It must be a glitch in the system. It wouldn't be the first time.
Is everything else okay?
Megan.
Yeah, thanks.
Wait, what?
Hey, Dave, where the hell are you, man?
Is everything all right?
The security cameras downstairs... Yeah?
Can I access the morgue footage?
I can't leave the desk unmanned, but...
here you go.
Thanks.
[GASPS] Oh, my God.
Come on, Megan. Just breathe.
WOMAN [ON PA]: Lab Tech Hernandez, please dial 1-6-6-7.
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah. Excuse me.
So, I thought I saw someone in the bathroom.
When I went to check the security footage,
I mean, I could have sworn it was her.
Meg, who is "her"? What are you talking about?
I need to show you something.
There.
What is that?
I don't know.
Well, I mean, it looks like a shadow.
It's not a shadow.
Look, when that guy broke in...
he kept talking about the woman he killed...
Hannah Grace, how she wasn't really dead.
I looked her up. She died three months ago during an exorcism.
You know I don't believe in that kind of stuff, but...
...this, to me, is not a shadow.
What is this?
Lisa, I didn't take any.
Are you lying to me? No, okay?
You need to believe me on this one.
I promise you, I didn't take any. I wanted to, but I didn't.
I've just had them in my bag for comfort. I promise.
Meg, do you...?
Do you remember when we were in meetings
and they started talking about coping mechanisms?
Yeah.
An addict's brain tries to find new ways to cope with stress.
Everything that has happened to you today,
the stress that it has caused,
your brain is desperate to find a way to cope with it.
And it is going to do anything it can to convince you to use again.
My brain did not put a corpse on the security footage.
Look, I don't know what that thing is,
but what I do know is you're jumping to the least plausible explanation.
And right now you've got to focus.
So, don't see things that aren't there.
Here. No.
Just take them. No.
I trust you.
Okay.
Dave?
Are you okay?
Dave?
Dave?
COMPUTER: Intake bay.
RANDY: I brought you a present.
Can you give me a hand again? Sorry. I can't help you out.
Not after last time. What? Why? What happened?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Okay. Well, try me.
MEGAN: So, it's obviously been a long night...
and I'm probably just remembering things wrong.
She had a huge wound...
going down this side of her abdomen when you dropped her off. Correct?
Yeah, I could have sworn that she did.
So, where is it now?
And her arm was banged up too, right?
Yeah. Have you checked the admittance photos?
The camera broke down and when I tried to scan her prints, the scanner died too.
That's weird.
So, I had a friend run her prints at the police station.
And?
Hannah Grace, she died three months ago during an exorcism.
Whoa. When that man broke in, he said she wasn't really dead,
and now it's almost like she's healing herself.
Can I ask you a personal question?
How personal?
Why are you working the night shift at a morgue?
Because it's my job. No, no. You're smart and resourceful.
So, what happened?
You know what? Actually, it's not even-- I'm sorry. It's not my business.
[SIGHS] I had a rough patch a few years back and...
I don't know, I guess I thought I saw that in you.
I'm sure that there is a rational explanation for all of this.
You just-- Megan, you've got to be careful
You just-- Megan, you've got to be careful that you don't drive yourself crazy here.
I know.
He's adorable.
I used to have a drinking problem.
And I would get drunk...
and lie and cheat and...
people told me that I was a dick sometimes.
All the time.
And then...
this guy shows up...
and he made me want to be a better person.
So...
I quit drinking...
I quit lying...
and then I was finally able to be honest with the people that love me...
because I was finally able to be honest with myself.
If you ever want to talk, I'm the guy.
Thank you.
Have a good night. You, too. Get home safe.
COMPUTER: Intake bay.
Hey, I was just about to call you.
That bottle of Xanax that you were looking for...
I didn't take it.
Megan, you already told me this.
I found it in the medicine cabinet after you moved out.
And I should have packed it up with the rest of your things...
but I kept it.
I've just been feeling anxious lately...
and I felt safer knowing that they were there.
You know, in case I needed them.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I'm tired of lying.
Anyway, I'll drop them off tomorrow morning if you're there.
Yeah, I'll be there. I'm glad you told me, okay?
Me, too. Bye. Bye.
COMPUTER: Going down.
This is Randy, drop-off complete.
Hello?
Hello?
Randy.
Randy?
Oh, my God.
Randy.
Andrew.
Megan, go to security right now. The guy who broke into the morgue killed the two officers
The guy who broke into the morgue killed the two officers transporting him to the station.
We have an APB out on him, but there's a chance he could make--
Move. ANDREW: Megan?
Megan?
Open it.
Get the lift.
Do you see what's happening to her body?
She's healing. She heals herself by killing people
She heals herself by killing people and then she rests.
Why hasn't she killed you?
I don't know.
I believe you.
There's something evil hiding inside.
The church...
said to walk away...
but I couldn't give up on my only child.
That's your daughter?
Not anymore.
Hannah struggled with depression...
anxiety.
It worked on her...
day after day...
till it broke her...
...found its way inside her body.
Is that when her eye changed?
Yeah.
That's the demon's mark.
No matter how many exorcisms they performed, it stayed.
One last...
...attempt.
In the name of God, in the name of Jesus Christ...
our Lord, be gone!
You have to understand...
...I did what I did...
...to save the lives of others.
But the demon was too powerful.
It stayed.
The next day, when we went to bury her...
...her body, it disappeared from the mortuary.
Four people were dead.
We have to get her to the incinerator.
The knife wasn't enough.
The only way to destroy this thing is to burn her.
Anything else just slows her down.
GRAINGER: No!
Come and get me!
No! Stop! [SCREAMING] No!
Stop!
No!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
COMPUTER: Mezzanine.
No.
COMPUTER: Going up.
COMPUTER: Arrived at mezzanine.
Officer Kurtz, reporting a 10-65.
I need backup at Boston Metro Hospital, possible homicide.
COMPUTER: Arrived at morgue.
Megan?
Megan?
Megan?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Who's there? It's Officer Kurtz.
Megan's friend. Where is she? Yeah, I don't know.
Dave's missing, too.
Everything's down. What's going on down here?
Oh, God.
ANDREW: Megan. Andrew. Oh, my God.
What happened? We have to get out of here.
[SCREECHING NOISE] ANDREW: What the hell is that?
Come on.
What? Oh, my God. Come on! Come on!
Hey!
COMPUTER: Going down.
ERNIE: Megan!
Hey, stop!
Hannah, no.
MEGAN: No!
Let him go!
Megan.
Megan.
Andrew. Are you okay?
MEGAN: Okay, come on. Hurry. We don't have much time.
Go get help. Wait. What? Megan.
No! Help me, please!
MEGAN: I'm 62 days clean...
...and I'm thankful for how far I've come.
It's not easy.
And I know I have a long way to go...
The magnificence of God's creation, the bounty of this Earth,
the miracle of modern life have never been so resplendent to our eyes.
Yet for some of us,
the American dream, the singular hope of our people, remains ever out of reach.
-[man 1] Amen! That's right, Preacher! -[man 2] Yes, sir!
[preacher] And though we may feel embittered, want to rail at injustice,
even in our God…
And though others may scorn our beliefs,
let us hold faith not only in that God, but in ourselves and our character.
-[woman 1] Yes! Amen! -[man 3] Amen!
[preacher] Our ability to rise, yea, to fly,
be this flight generations in the making, be it delayed so long our faith is bound.
Let that faith never be broken.
-[woman 2] Yes, Father God! -[men] Amen!
[preacher] At a time when families across the world are falling apart…
-[Papaw] Where are you going, J.D.? -[J.D.] Swim hole!
[Papaw] Don't get bit by a cottonmouth.
[J.D.] When people ask where I'm from,
I say Ohio 'cause that's where I lived most of my life,
but that's only part of my story.
Ask me where I feel most at home,
that's the hill country, Jackson, Kentucky.
Down those hollers is where I spent every summer.
Hands down the best part of my childhood.
It's where my people come from.
Hey.
-Hey. -Hey.
What you got there?
It's a, uh…
it's a turtle. See?
-Shell's cracked. Pull it off. -[chuckles] No.
It can't live without his shell. Ribcage is fused to the carapace.
-Chuck it. See how far you can throw it. -[J.D.] No. No, they can heal, okay?
[Nate] Whatever.
-[Bev] Why isn't anybody packed? -[Lindsay] I am.
I told Kevin we'd be home by 1:00.
-Hey, old woman. You packed? -What's your rush, Bev? Got a hot date?
Yeah, with not being bored off my ass. Next time I'll bring Chip.
No, you ain't. We don't need that drama here.
Just get your stuff!
Perch and swivel. I'll go when I'm ready.
-Real nice, Mom. -[Uncle Pet] Fire in the hole!
-[engine starts] -Yeah!
-Where's your brother at? -He rode off.
You couldn't keep an eye on him for two seconds?
-[boy 1] Yeah, get him! -[boy 2] Hey! He's coming up!
-[Dane] Go back to Ohio, boy! -[boy 1] Keep him under!
[Dane] Pussy!
-[J.D. gasps] -[Dane] Get outta here.
[J.D.] Things could get tough down in Jackson in a heartbeat,
but Mamaw and Papaw taught me that you never start a fight.
But if someone starts one with you, make damn sure you end it.
[Dane] Crawl on back to your mama, pussy. Tell her I'll be over tonight.
-[boy 2] Aw, here he comes! -[boy 1] Yeah, Dane! Punk!
[J.D.] If you can't end it, your people will always have your back.
Get off him!
[J.D.] And that was our code, and to me, our code was everything.
-Get off him! -What the hell you think you're doing?
You son of a bitch. I oughta put my foot up your ass so far, you gonna have hemorrhoids for ten years.
-You Hugh McCall's boy? -Eat shit, old man.
Get your ass outta here before I call your pa.
Freak.
-[Uncle Arch] Come on, J.D. -[wheezing]
What happened to you?
[Papaw] Well, he tried to get hisself into a fight.
Of all the lamebrain ways to get out of going home…
-Who did that? I'll kill him. -Mom, come on.
I'll kill him. Give me a name. C'mon.
Hugh McCall's boy and a couple other little assholes.
That McCall boy had an idea, it'd die of loneliness.
-Will you get him some ice? -Yup!
Did you tell them dickhead bastards the three of them ain't worth one Vance?
-[Bev] Of course he did! -Good boy.
-[Bev] All right. -It'll be all right.
-Are you all right? -I'm all right, Mom.
-Are you sure? -Yeah.
[chuckles] Get your things!
Whoo! And dry off! I ain't sitting next to that for three hours!
[man] You know you gonna be starving in 45 minutes anyway.
Let's get the family picture 'fore we go. Bev, get over here.
God forbid, we get on the road before noon.
-[Lori] Where are we gonna do it? -Over there. Lori, stand by your sister.
I want the sisters together. Everybody, look at the camera. C'mon.
C'mon, let's go.
I've had about all the Kentucky I can take.
[Lori] Bye, Daddy. Love you!
-Bye-bye. -[Mamaw] See you soon.
Why can't we stay longer? We're always the first ones to leave.
I don't get why you ever left Jackson.
'Cause when you're knocked up at 13, you get the hell out of Dodge. That's why.
[J.D.] When I was a kid, I couldn't make sense of it.
Imagining Mamaw at almost my same age
just running, pregnant, from everything she knew,
every scrap of family she had.
I felt like I'd stumbled onto something. A puzzle piece, an answer to a question
I had barely begun to ask about our family and what became of us.
Oh, thank God. Back to civilization.
-J.D., get my stuff. -[J.D.] No.
I wouldn't call Middletown civilization.
Kevin! Hi! [giggles]
[Mamaw chuckling] Hey! Aw, now, there's my little buddy.
Bev, give me some of them ribs.
His no-good mother behind the curtains.
Wouldn't spit on her ass if her guts were on fire.
[chuckles] Here ya go, little buddy. Here.
All right. You take that home.
-All right. -Thank you.
[chuckles] You're welcome. All right.
[Lindsay giggles] Let's go!
I'm gonna head on down to my place. See ya tomorrow.
-Night, y'all. -[J.D.] Goodnight, Mamaw.
-Good night, daughter. -[Bev] Night, Dad. See ya tomorrow.
[J.D.] Whatever better life my grandparents had chased up Route 23,
they never caught it.
We were all different in Middletown somehow.
I don't know, like something was missing. Maybe hope.
-Paycheck. -Sorry. Thanks.
You couldn't get to Yale on Route 23,
but I'd come closer than any of 'em to that dream of something better.
I could see it right there in front of me.
But a part of me knew the road from here to there is rocky.
[J.D.] There's no way around but through.
[softly] What? Put it away.
-Eat it. -No, I have to study.
-Usha, you have to eat. -They'll boot me if they see food in here.
I'll cover for you. Come on.
-[J.D.] Stop! They're coming! -What?
Put it away! They know! They're coming!
-Okay. -The cameras!
They're gonna take you to the dungeons, Usha, the famous Yale dungeons! [laughs]
[laughing] You jerk! Stop! Do you want some?
No, I have a dinner tonight.
-You're gonna do great. -[sighs]
-Are you nervous? What's going on? -No.
I'm going to shine up against the triple Ivy League types.
If you're desperate, talk about the Hatfield-McCoy thing.
-I never should have told you that. -[laughs] This is ridiculous.
Hey. You're gonna get this, okay?
I have to 'cause I'm not letting you go to D.C. without me.
I don't want to be there without you.
I have a meeting.
-Mm. -But I love you.
I love you.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
I love you back.
Thanks.
-[Jill] Hey, J.D., good to see you. -Hey. Yeah.
So you got your aid package for next year?
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.
I know. It's not as much as the first year.
Jill, I'm working three jobs. I still can't afford $21,000.
How's firm week going?
It's going. I got a callback, a dinner tonight, interviews tomorrow--
The standard salary for a summer associate is well over $30,000.
If I get the job. What if I don't?
I'm looking for a contingency plan.
Is there one?
I'd do more for you if I could.
You're gonna get one of these jobs, J.D.
I'm sure of it.
[J.D.] I would definitely consider a clerkship,
but I could also see myself going the firm route, as well.
Makes perfect sense. Keep your options open.
Let's introduce you around.
Perfect. There's actually someone I was hoping to meet.
Holly! You made it!
Brooks! Yes, I did.
[man] As an editor at the Journal,
I had the opportunity to meet with all the top firms,
so I would consider something…
Excuse me.
Call me Tuesday.
Care for wine, sir?
Have some. They're serving the good stuff.
Red or white?
White is fine.
Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc?
Try the Chardonnay.
-Thank you. -You were saying…
-[cell phone vibrates] -Yes, I-- Sorry.
Um, so, my girlfriend has a summer position in D.C.,
and I was hoping to talk to Phillip Roseman
-because his firm-- -There he is right there.
Tall guy with the glasses.
Remind me. Where did you go for undergrad?
-Ohio State. -Right. Plenty of great state schools.
[Phillip] …corporate lawyer father upset about that?
[man] Oh, of course. We all have our share of that, too.
So litigation, pretty big transition.
Is this seat taken?
Go ahead.
Phillip Roseman.
Uh, J.D. Vance. Thanks.
That's the thing to do. That's what I did my first summer.
…cutthroat nature of it all. I wanted to focus on the laws. [laughs]
You on the Journal?
-No, I didn't get in this time. -Too bad.
-I'm gonna try again, though. -Lot of firms won't touch you without it.
Yes, sir. That's what I've heard.
Will you excuse me? I'm sorry.
J.D.?
Why are there so many fuckin' forks?
Usha, what am I supposed to do with all these forks?
They had two different kinds of white wine. It's like a test.
[Usha] It is a test.
Next time just say you'll have whatever's driest.
[J.D.] Driest, okay.
Listen, use the silverware from the outside in.
If the knife has a funny edge, it's for fish.
If the spoon's too big, it's for soup,
and the spoon at the top, that's for dessert.
Try this: put your first finger and your thumb together on each hand.
-What? -[Usha] Do it. Just do it.
You have "D" for drink on the right and "B" for bread on the left.
-Got it? -Okay.
Now put your hands up to your eyes.
-Now what? -Oh, my God. You actually did it?
[chuckling] Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. I'm such an idiot. Why are you with me?
Well, because you're not a douchebag and you don't know how to use forks.
You got a callback at the best firm. Are you registering that?
It's just a dinner, right?
Just a dinner, piece of cake. Thank you, spirit guide.
-Ah, don't mention it. Okay, bye. -Bye.
Jesus, Linds. What is it? I'm at a dinner interview thing.
[Lindsay] It's Mom.
She's in the hospital.
Well, is she okay? What happened?
She started using again.
I can't do this right now.
Heroin.
What?
She OD'd.
"'Class, this is a tadpole,' said Mr. Shepherd."
What do you think a tadpole becomes?
-Frog! -[Bev] A frog!
-J.D., go long! It's for you! -[all cheer]
-[Bev] That's my boy! [laughs] -[J.D. laughs]
Mom?
Did I do something?
[Brett] I told her the only progeny I want are billable hours.
-[Rich] That's good. -You all right?
Yes, sir. I'm fine. Thank you.
Did you meet Rich and Pamela?
-Hi. -[J.D.] Hello.
-Great to meet you, J.D. -Good to meet you, sir.
[Rich] Brett was just telling us about his remarkable transformation
from Harvard Business School grad to Yale law student.
So… what's your story?
Well, I'm from Ohio, but my family is from Kentucky.
-Bluegrass State. -Yes, sir.
I joined the Marines out of high school, served in Iraq.
-Wow. -It was a great experience. It helped pay for college.
-It's the American dream. -[J.D.] Exactly.
Then I finished up and got my degree in two years.
So your family, were they, uh, coal miners?
No, actually, my grandfather went north to work at a steel plant
like a lot of folks from Appalachia did.
They were actually sort of hillbilly royalty
because my Papaw was related to the guy who started the Hatfield-McCoy feud.
-Really? -Yes, ma'am.
-No kidding. -I just saw that miniseries.
What's it like when you go back?
I don't really get a lot of chances to go back.
It must feel like you're from another planet.
Yeah, uh, you know, I guess.
Like, you know, "Who are all these rednecks?" [laughs]
We don't really use that term.
Oh, no. Yeah, that's not at all what…
It's just, you know,
I mean, you're at a top educational institutions in the world--
My mother was salutatorian of her high school.
Smartest person I've met, probably smarter than anyone in this room.
Maybe so.
Well, I didn't mean any disrespect.
Looks like you failed on that one.
It sounds like we should be offering your mother a position.
How'd it get so bad? You had to have known.
[Lindsay] I can't be with her every minute. I've got my own shit.
Kevin's Bronco keeps breaking down, and now he's working nights
and I'm the one that's got to get it fixed.
And this dirtbag Mom's been screwing, Ray, is a junkie.
And with Aunt Lori gone, it's all on me.
-Guys! -[girl] No, he did not!
[shouting] Guys, I am trying to talk to your uncle! Stop it!
Sorry for yelling.
-I'm sorry I haven't been there, Lindsay. -Can you come now?
I can't. It's Interview Week and if I'm not here, I just--
Can't you come home?
-["I Wanna Dance with Somebody" playing] -Why do we do this every year?
'Cause it's what we do. That's why.
Couldn't we hide the old ones?
At Christmas, I can rewrap your presents and put it under a fake tree.
At Christmas, I can rewrap your presents and put it under a fake tree. Would you like that?
-[scoffs] -[TV playing] [Bev] Can you turn down your show? I can't hear Whitney.
She sounds better that way.
Wiseass.
Come on. Mom, I'm watching Gore.
[Bev] You made this one when you were five.
I was ten.
Whatever. It's a memory and I'm gonna have it when I'm old.
-I just have to-- -[Bev] Lindsay?
What?
-It's Kevin. -I don't care if it's the baby Jesus.
It's Easter, God damn it. Get your ass in here.
[Lindsay] I gotta go.
[Bev] "It's Kevin."
It's always Kevin.
What do you want me to do?
Blow an egg or help out with Mamaw's basket. Git!
-[Lindsay] Ugh! -What do I even put on it?
-Be creative. What will she like? -Menthols.
-[J.D. laughs] -She likes flowers. Make one out of this.
[Chip] Hey-hey! Hope someone's home.
I hope that's Chip. He got something for you two.
Come in! Come on.
-[J.D.] What? -Hey.
-What do you think, J.D.? -[Bev] Don't just sit there. It's yours!
[Lindsay] Aww! [J.D.] What do we name him? This is great.
-Jesus. How big is that thing gonna get? -He was the best one.
-What do you say? -[Lindsay] Hi.
-What do you say? -Thank you.
Take him outside.
-[J.D.] He's good-looking. -Look at his paws.
-Take him outside. -[Lindsay] Come here.
-Get him! -[J.D.] I got him!
Get him before he pisses!
-[J.D.] Come here. -He is sniffing around--
-He's going in my room! -Oh, no.
Get him before he ruins my rug!
Bad dog. You are a bad dog! He does that again, I'll fucking kill him!
-You're the one that wanted a dog! -[Lindsay] Mom!
He just pisses wherever the hell he wants.
Should fit in just fine around here. [laughs]
You take him outside. [sniffles] I'll pick up the piss.
-[J.D.] I can take him. -Making messes.
-Here's the leash. -Give me that, okay?
-I can take him! -Okay, but be careful.
-[J.D.] I got him! -[Lindsay] Get it!
-[Bev] J.D.! -[J.D.] I didn't mean--
How many times have I told you not to be so fucking careless?
-I'm sorry! -You're sorry?
"I'm sorry." Go to your room!
C'mon, babe. They're just eggs.`
Oh, fuck you. Those are heirlooms. My family heirlooms.
Who's that? One of them chatterboxes in a haunted house? [chuckles]
Atog.
How long are you gonna be mad at me, huh?
[man screams] 'Cause I don't have the money!
Why didn't you tell me? Wasn't it important?
No, you stupid bitch!
[woman] Oh, I'm the stupid bitch?
-Those two. -[woman] I could pay the bills!
-Never gets old. -[clattering]
[woman] Come back here!
-[car starts and drives away] -Look, I'm sorry.
Sometimes I just fuck up, but…
Wanna go to your favorite store?
Get some football cards…
'Cause I'm gonna go with or without you right now.
Then it'll be me standing there
staring at all those cute men in tight pants.
-Come on. [laughs] -All right. Okay. [chuckles]
-See ya next time. -[man] Thanks, Steve.
Who you got?
[Bev] You need to find a new favorite. Joe Montana's not playing anymore.
He's a four-time Super Bowl champion, three-time MVP,
All-Pro First Team three times and 117 career wins.
You sound like an automaton.
40,551 career passing yards.
-[chuckles] Okay. -Yeah.
-How'd you get so smart? -I dunno.
Who do you think it came from?
-Sure. -Me! It's true.
-Okay. -You remember that.
-Whatever you say. -Joe Montana has all of that.
But who has the best touchdown dance, huh?
Deion.
-Mm-hmm. -Of course.
-Mom! Mom, stop! -That's how it goes, right?
-No! Not at all. It's like this. -Okay.
Hey, pick those up.
-[Bev laughing] -You shouldn't be dancing in the store.
[mockingly] "Don't dance in the store."
Pick those up now!
He's doing it!
Just… get out!
-He hasn't bought his cards! -Get out!
Fine! Come on, J.D.
Bitch!
[Bev] Quick!
Take it. Hide it.
[Bev laughing] Go get in the car! Come on!
Chip would've lost his shit if he'd been there.
[laughs] I might not even tell him.
Of course I'll tell him. It's too good. Come on.
You like Chip, right?
Yeah, he's okay. He just… He talks about police all the time.
Well, he's a cop.
Yeah, but he could still talk about other stuff, I guess.
We've been talking about moving in…
to Chip's house, all of us.
You'd have your own room, and he's got a ping-pong table.
That'd be good, right?
[sighs] I don't know.
Why not?
We'd just move out again. And then we'd have to find a new place.
It's kinda what always happens.
You know, Chris, he calls him your flavor of the month. [chuckles]
What?
He's met a few of your boyfriends--
You let that little shit talk about your mom like that?
-I don't let him! He just said it. -After everything that I do for you?
You think I'd give these losers the time of day?
What do you think I do it for?
So you and Lindsay will have everything I never had.
You have no clue.
I was second in my whole class, out of 400 people. Did you know that?
I coulda done whatever I wanted,
but I didn't have somebody taking me to the library
and telling me I could go to college, and gonna help me pay for it.
-I could crash. -Mom!
I could crash this car and I could kill us.
-Then you would know how lucky you are! -Stop the car please!
-Stop! -J.D., get back in your goddamn seat!
Quit your crying! You really think I was gonna kill us?
Chris is right! You're a bitch!
Is that what you think of your mother?
-[J.D.] You're a loser! -Yeah?
Just look at yourself, you little fat ass!
Yeah? You think you can say that to me?
-You can't! -Let go of me, Mom!
Get back here!
[Bev] God damn it!
[Bev] J.D.!
J.D., you get back here!
God damn it!
[J.D.] Help me! Please! Please!
-Help me! -[woman] What's going on?
-Please, my mom is trying to kill me! -[Bev] God damn it.
-You get out here! -Get inside quickly.
-[Bev] J.D.! You get out here now! -I got dogs, they bite!
[Bev] I wasn't talking to you! You get fucking out here!
-Fuck! J.D.? -[woman] I ain't opening the door!
-Hello? Mamaw, come get me! I'm at-- -11345 County Road!
-[J.D.] 11345 County Road. -Let me in!
-I ain't opening the door! -Open!
Mom's losing it! Bring Papaw!
-Open the door! -You were trying to kill him!
Let me the fuck in!
-Are you kidding me? -Bring Papaw!
[Bev] Get your ass out to the car!
-Mom! -11345 County Road! Hurry, come here now!
-I'm gonna call Children's Services! -Go ahead and fucking do that.
-[siren beeps] -Get on your fucking feet! Get in the fucking car! Come on!
-Thank God you're here! -Did you call them, you bitch, huh?
[woman] She barged in!
-This is a family matter. -[officer] Let the boy go!
-I didn't do anything. He's a brat. -Take your hands off of the boy!
-Are you kidding me right now? [laughs] -Step back.
Come on, son.
-[error message chimes] -Are you kidding me?
Christ.
Can y'all do something about this Wi-Fi? It's shit.
Nah, man, it comes and it goes.
-God. Hey, babe. -[Usha] Hey.
I thought you were coming over after your dinner.
Yeah, uh, sorry about that. I sort of got sidetracked.
[Usha] So, how was it?
I don't know. I think I fucked it up pretty good.
-[scoffs] Come on, J.D. -I sort of lost it on one of the partners.
He deserved it,
but I'm guessing that isn't what gets you a final interview.
-J.D.? -Yeah, I'm here.
Here where?
[J.D.] Somewhere in New Jersey, I think.
What?
But… don't you have interviews tomorrow?
My mom's in the hospital.
Oh, my God. What happened? Is she okay?
She's using again.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry, J.D.
Yeah, I just… I gotta get back there.
-Hey, um, do you want me to fly out? -No, please.
I can look up a flight right now.
Usha, thank you, but you don't have to do that.
Okay.
Maybe you could ask a professor to reach out for you.
-Ask for another chance. -What are they gonna say?
"He tanked his interview, but he's from a fucked up family."
"Let's give him another chance."
Hey. Sorry, man. Your card declined.
Really? Sorry… Um…
Sorry, Usha. Can I call you back?
Yeah. Um…
Call me when you get there.
This one should work. Sorry.
[J.D.] Okay.
Listen, it's all going to be okay, J.D.
Just… just drive safe.
Thanks, babe.
Okay, bye.
Bye.
-[Mamaw] Where's my grandson? -Right here.
What's he doing in a cop car like a goddamn criminal?
[officer] We're making sure he's safe.
Well, we're here, ain't we? Get him out of there.
-I'll let him out. Everybody stay calm. -All right.
Come here. You're all right, J.D. You're all right.
[Bev] I didn't do anything!
-Let her go! -No, J.D.!
-Let my mom go! -Son, let me explain how this'll work.
-No! Nothing happened! -Listen to me!
Listen to me.
This might be normal in your family, but it's not right.
Your mom's gonna need some help.
Now, we can get it for her if you tell us what happened.
Son, did she hit you?
No.
She didn't do anything.
I was just being stupid.
[officer] All right.
Take 'em off. Nobody's gonna press charges.
It's gonna be all right. You're a good boy, J.D.
You did good to call us, son. You did good.
-Are you okay now? -I'm okay.
[Scott] All right, folks! It's 8:15 a.m. here at WGGC.
You're with Trish and Scott.
We are broadcasting live all day from Middletown Skateway with giveaways. -Right, Trish? -That's right, Scott!
-Right, Trish? -That's right, Scott! 93.8's got the hookup for you.
Twenty-five people are gonna go home with free T-shirts…
[Scott] We have not one but two free tickets to see Brad Paisley…
-Excuse me, ma'am. -Yes?
-Can you please tell me where-- -[Bev] Don't tell me the rule!
What rule tells you you gotta kick someone out after they almost died?
[nurse] As I have explained, it is a 24-hour policy.
I worked at this hospital before you had zits.
[nurse] Lower your voice. We have other patients here.
[Bev] There's a news flash. We're in a hospital. She's a genius.
-We are not asking for more than a week. -She's stable. Her vitals are normal.
-[indistinct arguing] -Excuse me. I'm her son.
Guys, what's going on? They're trying to kick Mom out, that's what's goin' on.
Your mother's stable, ready for discharge.
-My ass. I'm clammy, I have a fever. -[Lindsay] Look at her!
-[J.D.] Where are you sending her? -Wherever you want.
Is there a facility that you set up for patients?
There are several private options in the area. I can have the discharge planner come speak with you.
-Oh, please. -[J.D.] That would be great.
We need help to figure out what insurance will cover and what we gotta do.
Your mother doesn't have insurance.
I let it lapse.
When I worked here, we didn't turf patients because they couldn't pay.
Ma'am, this is the hospital's policy.
-Call Terry Cleary-- -He hasn't worked here in over ten years.
Okay, well, call somebody who knows something!
-Can you call in the attending, please? -Done.
-Great. Thank you. -[J.D.] Thank you.
-She is good for something. -[nurse] Dr. Newton?
Morning. How are we all today?
We'd be a lot better if we could figure something fuckin' out--
Can we talk out in the hallway, please?
-Sure. -[J.D.] Thank you.
[Bev] Go out in the hall like I can't hear a fucking conversation with my doctor!
I'm, uh, J.D., Beverly's son, and I'm sorry about all that, okay?
I just got into town. I'm gonna find her a program.
-I only need a place for one night. -Unfortunately, we don't have the beds.
The best you'll do is a Suboxone prescription for her to take home.
She doesn't… I don't know where she's going to go.
I'm sorry.
You know she worked at this hospital for years, right?
This is probably where this shit started with the pain pills and the bullshit.
I wish I could help you.
You have until 3:00 today. It's the best I can do.
I got us until 3:00.
That's what your law school negotiating could get us, till 3:00.
Oh, let's hear it for Yale.
See you later, Mom. I'll be back to get you.
How's that fancy school anyway?
It's fine, Mom.
Linds says you got a girlfriend.
What's her name?
I'll be back to pick you up at 3:00, okay?
-Welcome home. -Gee, thanks.
-Shit. I'm late now. -For what?
One of the moms from Meghan's soccer team
dumped this party on me last-minute.
-[cell phone vibrating] -We've got, like, five paper napkins and a half a pack of hot dogs.
Sorry about this, Linds. Hello.
-[woman] J.D. Vance? -Yes?
I'm calling from Phillip Roseman's office at Glaston Hamburg.
We'd like to invite you to a final interview tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
Uh, that's amazing. [chuckles] Thank you so much. That's so great.
But 10:00 a.m. tomorrow…
Is there another time Mr. Roseman can meet me?
I'm a ten-hour drive away from New Haven.
[woman] I'm afraid not.
Mr. Roseman's only in New Haven for one more day.
Okay, 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. Uh, thank you. Bye.
-What? -Summer internship.
My final interview's tomorrow. It's the only one I got.
-I gotta be there. -One day?
-Short visit. -Yeah.
Yeah, just about a day too long. Heroin, Lindsay? Jesus.
When did she go off a cliff?
-Dad? -[J.D. banging on door] Papaw!
-[Bev] Do you hear anything? -[J.D.] No!
-[Mamaw] I can see him! -I see him!
He got the TV on too loud. I'm breaking it.
-What? -I'm breaking it.
[J.D.] Just move!
[Bev banging on door] J.D.! Unlock the door!
Dad! Dad!
-Oh, my God. Call an ambulance. -[Bev] Dad?
[Mamaw] Call!
-It's too late. -How do you know?
'Cause I'm a nurse, Mom. I know. He's dead.
[Bev] No, it's not an emergency. We just need a coroner.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Jimmy…
Why do they do that, Mamaw?
'Cause we're hill people, honey. We respect our dead.
[J.D.] I didn't know till after he was gone
how Papaw had protected my mom from the world.
Now the only person who ever got her was gone.
Whatever dreams she or any of us had…
they all just seemed that much further away.
Hey, you all right, babe?
[Bev] Matt, I'm fine.
-[woman] Is this going to hurt? -[Bev] I already did it.
I give you the special treatment, Janice. You know that.
That other one sure don't.
[laughs] Kit? She's new, she'll learn.
-Can I get you anything else? -No, I'm good.
-[Bev] All right. Here. -[woman] Thank you.
You're back. How was the funeral?
Oh, you know, same old family bullshit.
Oh, my God, are those yours?
Mm. I go after work. The parking lot is perfect for it.
Oh, my God, I used to…
-Can I try 'em? What size are they? -[Katrina] Um, they're a seven.
-[Katrina] Do they fit? -Like a glove.
I used to love these. You know, the roller rink.
-Yeah, and go on dates? -[chuckles] Oh, I was so hot.
I went dancing and everything. Can I try them out?
-Where're you gonna go? -[laughing]
Sorry!
♪ Hot summer streets And the pavements are burning ♪ ♪ I sit around ♪
[laughing] Hello!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. [laughing] -Nurse! Nurse!
-Somebody call security! -Security!
So what did they do?
They fired my ass. What do you think they did?
-Oh, Beverly! -[Bev] I was sick of that place anyway.
Gainful employment was cramping her style.
[Bev] I will get another job.
You could lose your fucking license.
What are you doing?
[Bev] I got a headache. I need a--
[Mamaw] You can't have a goddamn hissy every time you have an off day.
You gotta think about these kids.
What do you think I've been thinking about since I was 18 years old, huh?
Never had a life where I wasn't thinking about the kids.
It's all about us.
-[Mamaw] So what are you gonna do? -Figure something out.
Great plan, Mom.
It isn't easy, all right? Just wait till you get pregnant.
I'm not having a kid.
You think you're special? That's what happens to girls.
Only girls that are stupid.
-Beverly! -[Bev] You wanna call me stupid?
-Little bitch! -[Lindsay] I'm going to Kevin's!
[Bev] It's easy when someone else is paying the bills!
-[Lindsay] I'm smarter than you! -[Bev] You gotta respect your mother!
Can I put on Meet the Press? There's a special about Monica Lewinsky.
[sniffles] I don't want to hear any more of that filth.
-What's the name of this game? -Son of a bitch!
[chuckles] Watch your mouth. Gin.
-[Mamaw chuckles] -I never win.
Well, if you don't like it, find some lame-ass loser to play with.
Deal.
-[Mamaw] Oh, my God. -Shit!
You are the worst fucking card player I ever met.
-How many times you've seen this movie? -Oh, about a hundred.
Why do you keep watching it?
Like it, I figure.
Everyone in this world is one of three kinds:
a good Terminator, a bad Terminator, and neutral.
You're a good Terminator.
Well, wasn't always. I had to learn.
You could be, too, if you don't fuck it up.
You're like me.
Is Mom like you?
She and Papaw were more the same.
He was a good Terminator.
[sighs] At times, he could be the bad one.
Why do you think he was living down the street there?
How was he bad?
He let things get to him, make him feel small.
Could I be bad?
-Ugh. One of them crazies down the street. -[people screaming]
[Mamaw] It's always something.
J.D.
[Lindsay] Somebody get help!
[man 1] We need help! Someone call 911!
-Mom? -What about me? Huh? Anybody?
-[man 2] Ma'am, get out of the road! -Help me!
-You won't help me! -[Lindsay] Please help her!
-Help me! Can anyone help me? -[Matt] Calm down! Bev!
-Hey! -[Lindsay] You're just upset--
[Bev] No!
-Mom? -Hey!
You're just upset! We all miss him!
Stop acting like he was your dad! He was my dad!
-You little bitch! -Hey! Stop!
-[Bev] He's my dad! -Stop it, Bev! Stop it!
[sobbing] Mom, please…
[officer 1] Stand back! Calm down, we just need you to breathe.
-Bev… -He's my dad!
Stand back!
[Bev screaming] No! No! No!
-[Mamaw] J.D.! -[Bev] No!
Don't look at that! Come on! Don't you look at…
-You look at me! -Okay.
You look at me! All right?
Lindsay, honey! Come back down to my house!
-[officer 2] You need to calm down. -No!
-[officer 1] Calm down! -[Lindsay] Help her!
Yes, I'm looking for a bed for my mother.
No, she doesn't have insurance. But, um…
No? Okay. Thanks.
Shit.
[J.D.] Please don't put me on hold.
Oh, my God. Is that a fried baloney sandwich?
-[chuckles] -My savior.
-[laughing] -Come on, Linds. Seriously. I need this.
-Give me the damn sandwich. -I saved you the last slice.
I figured they don't have that at Yale.
I think this might be outlawed at Yale. My God.
I miss this.
There they are. Oh, look at you, huh?
Keep it down! He's talking to Yale! Ooh!
I ain't seen you since your Mamaw's funeral.
-[J.D.] Been that long? -Hey, Linds.
-Was she a holy terror. -Yeah. [chuckles]
-You got the beer. -Yes, I do.
[Lindsay] Did you get the buns?
Uh… I…
Well, enjoy your bunless dogs then.
-I will. -[Cheryl] Nice.
So what are you doing here, man?
Taking care of my mother, dealing with all that.
[Louis] I was there when Lindsay brought her in.
-I'm sorry. -[J.D.] I was trying to find her a rehab.
-Whatever you do, don't go to Cedar Creek. -Trade ya.
[J.D.] Why? What's with Cedar Creek?
-Cedar Creek? Food's shit. -[Louis] My brother-in-law was there.
-What's that one… -[Louis] Got bed mites.
Get her into Fairlawn. It's like a resort.
They don't have beds. Plus, we can't afford that shit.
-Hey, honey! -Yeah?
Doesn't your friend Sally work over at that rehab…
New Beginnings.
-Call and see if they got anything open. -[Cheryl] Sure.
Can you believe someone married this guy?
Hell no. You kidding me? You blindfold her?
Yeah, I blindfolded her. That's what I did.
Anything?
I'm still on hold. It's unbelievable.
Have you even talked to her?
I just don't want to drag her into it, you know?
-You don't think she's in it? -[cell phone clicks]
-Don't be an asshole. Let her decide. -[scoffs]
Damn.
But Parker has taken it a step further
-to say judges are inherently political… -[cell phone vibrates] …which isn't necessarily true.
-Be right back. -Usha's right.
-Hey. -[J.D.] Hey.
-Did you make it home all right? -Yeah, sorry I didn't call sooner.
I've just been dealing with all this stuff.
Um, is your mom okay?
It's hard to tell, honestly,
but the hospital's kicking her out at 3:00 p.m.
and, uh, we're having a bitch of a time finding her a rehab so…
But, uh… Oh! [chuckles] Guess what?
[Usha] What?
I got a call from Glaston Hamburg.
You did? For a final interview?
-Yeah, uh, with Phillip Roseman… -Yes!
-…tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. -That's incredible, J.D.
Yeah, if I can make it.
Listen. Let me come.
I can stay with your mom and you come back and interview.
Usha, I appreciate it.
But you'd have no idea what you'd be walking into.
I've been in hospitals before, when my grandmother was sick.
It's not the fucking flu, Usha!
Okay? My mom overdosed on heroin.
-What? -Is that the kind of problem you want?
I didn't think so.
Look, I gotta get back and deal with all this stuff. Bye.
-[Lindsay] J.D.! -Yeah?
[Lindsay] Come here.
The guy said, "Objectivity doesn't exist and legal interpretation is subjective."
Exactly. What does that mean? We can't trust the judicial system?
Cheryl thinks they might have space. Let's go.
Talk to Sally Coates.
She said there was a spot that was spoken for, but go on down.
-Thank you, Cheryl. -Yeah. You're welcome.
Mom, where are my cleats?
Check under your bed, honey. Get me outta here.
-So you're a soccer mom. -Such a fake.
I don't know. I think I got you out-faked by a mile.
You really think rehab…
What?
Think it'll do any good this time?
You miss me?
Yeah.
[Bev] Is Lindsay around? Not spending all her time with Prince Charming? [chuckles]
You know how it is.
I, uh…
-I brought you this. -What's this?
Some stuff for you to do while you're in here
so you don't get bored.
It's got funny jokes and math problems and some Bible stuff, too.
I made it.
I love you.
When I get out of here, I'm going to make a real home for us.
Okay?
You gotta help me do more cooking and all that healthy stuff, okay?
It's gonna be different now.
[receptionist] New Beginnings. How may I direct your call?
-Hi. -[woman] Hi.
We're here to visit my son Victor. Victor Boyd.
Oh, of course. Please have a seat.
Hi, sir. Yes?
Hello. I'm J.D. Vance. I'm here to see Sally Coates.
[Sally] To be honest with you, I know you and Cheryl go back,
I'd love to help, but there's a procedure to getting on the wait list--
Ma'am, I understand.
Okay, but my mom's had a really tough time since Mamaw died a few years back.
I wish I could help. It's just--
I respect your need to follow procedure.
I know she messed up.
And she's had a history of it,
but she also has a history of being a pretty good person.
She put herself through nursing school as a single mother,
and now I'm at law school.
I just… I really… Ma'am, I really think that…
if my mom had somebody to believe in her…
You need to understand that I can't leave here.
I can't until I've done everything humanly possible.
All right? This is my family.
So until you drag me out of here, I'm gonna keep giving you reasons.
[man over PA] Jason Flip, please report to the Group Room.
Jason Flip, to the group room please. Thank you.
-Glad I was able to help. -Thank you so much.
Good, Linds.
Okay, uh, bear with me here.
Five hundred on this one and a thousand on this one.
Sorry. Five hundred on this one and a thousand on this one.
This one?
[receptionist] We'll authorize it now, but it won't charge till she's admitted.
[Lindsay] Yup. Okay. [J.D.] That should be for the first week.
Pick me up here.
I need payment for the first two weeks to check her in.
Okay. Um…
Okay, put 500 more on this one
and, uh… 1,000 on that one.
And that should be… good. Let me know if those all go through.
Sorry about this.
[receptionist] Last one.
Okay, you're good.
-Are you serious? -I am! [chuckles]
Okay, perfect. Thank you.
That's done.
Amazing. I'll come back and sign those.
-I'll let my mom know what's going on. -Yes, sir.
Okay, uh, you're good to go.
Once the doctor and the therapist do their assessment of you.
-No, thanks. -[J.D.] What are you talking about?
I changed my mind.
-Where are you going? -What?
-I begged them to let you stay here. -Nobody asked you to.
-I'm not a charity case. -Why am I here, Mom?
-Feel superior maybe? -[J.D.] How can you be so fucking selfish?
-You even care what you do to Lindsay? -J.D., shut up.
-Leave her out of this! -You did the same thing to Mamaw.
You just took and took from her until she was practically bankrupt.
-Yeah, she was a goddamn saint. -All she ever did was bail you out!
Except when it mattered!
Do you actually want to be dead? Or you just too lazy to try?
-[Lindsay] J.D.! Don't! -Oh, I tried… plenty!
-[J.D.] I'm done with her. -Don't be stupid.
We can't leave her here. She's got no place to go.
-You keep defending her. -I'm not!
She was worse to you than anybody. Now she's making you feel guilty.
Just like she did with Mamaw.
You don't know everything, J.D.
She's been doing this since we were kids, Lindsay. Come on.
Well, it didn't start with her.
Mom and Aunt Lori, they had it worse than us.
It was a war in that house.
[Mamaw] Beverly, hide your sister in the closet! Go on!
-[Papaw] Shut up! -[Mamaw] What kinda man are you?
You come home drunk one more time, I'm gonna light your ass on fire!
[Papaw] I'll come home whenever I goddamn please!
-Shut your mouth! See what happens! -[Mamaw] Stop!
Stop it! Get out!
You goddamn son of a bitch. You're lying there in your own piss!
I told you what I was gonna do!
[Mamaw] This is your own doing!
You're no goddamn father!
I can't defend her…
but I'm trying to forgive her.
If you don't, you're never gonna get out of what you're trying to get out of.
Mom, this is…
This is my girlfriend. This is Usha.
What is she?
She's Indian.
Well, she's really pretty.
I think you'd like her a lot.
You should bring her here.
I've been doing real good.
I've been working, trying to get my license back. I…
I just had a down…
you know, month.
I got an interview tomorrow, Mom.
-Otherwise, I'd-- -Yeah.
You sure you don't wanna stay here?
-I got you the bed. -Oh, no.
Just take me to Ray's.
-Mom, come on. -Oh, you know me.
I always land on my feet.
Congratulate me, why don't you? I'm a married woman.
You're getting married?
I got married. [laughs]
Well?
Aren't you happy for me? Hello?
Why didn't you tell anybody?
-I thought you two were gonna break up. -I didn't marry Matt.
I married Ken.
What?
Who the hell's Ken?
My boss at the dialysis center.
Ugh. Kiss my ruby-red asshole. When'd all this happen?
[Bev] It's been going on.
Anyway, it's been over with Matt for a while.
It's over with Matt?
Well, obviously. I married somebody else.
This is a kitchen with kitchen stuff.
And…
this was a kegerator when we moved in.
Yeah, I wanted to keep it, but… [chuckles]
We keep sodas there now.
Hey, I'm sorry about your dog.
You know, I can't breathe. It's the dander.
Hey, let me show you your room.
Over here.
This is Travis.
Uh, Travis, this is J.D.
[Ken] Settle in.
[Travis] You wanna see something?
My dad smokes all the time. He doesn't know I take it.
He keeps it in here.
Wanna get high?
What? You never smoked?
[J.D.] It's a gateway drug.
-My mom's in recovery-- -Chickenshit!
What do they do where you come from, hmm?
-Whippits? -No.
[Travis] Come on! It's no big deal.
-You gotta loosen up a bit, man. -I, uh…
[Travis] You just gotta go for it. Come on.
[J.D.] I gotta go.
-Maybe next time. -Pussy!
-[Bev] J.D., I've been looking for you. -[door closes]
I need you to piss in this.
I got a call from the nursing board. I have to give them a sample today.
-A sample? -Clean piss.
Mamaw's got 100 prescriptions in hers, so--
Why isn't yours clean?
Just do it. Okay?
-Why isn't yours clean? -Come on now. Go do it!
-No! -Please!
[Bev] Look…
[voice breaks] I know that I messed up.
I've been trying really hard with Ken, but it just…
It isn't easy, and… I promise that I'm gonna do better,
but I can't lose my job.
-You should've thought of that before. -I know. I really need this.
No! If you want clean piss, stop fucking up your life
and get it from your own bladder!
What is going on down here?
She wants my piss because hers is dirty.
It's for the nursing board!
J.D., you need to help your mama on this.
You let her get away with this every time. How is she gonna learn?
I told you I would do better.
-You always say that! You're lying! -I always try!
J.D.--
If you'd put your foot down years ago, she wouldn't be like this! She wouldn't!
You're a shitty mom and so are you!
-[Mamaw] J.D. -What?
[Mamaw] You may be right about some of what you said.
But things haven't exactly worked out for your mama.
We can't let them take her license.
Why? It's her own stupid fault.
I know this ain't right, honey, but she's your mother.
And maybe if we help her this one last time,
she'll finally learn her lesson and keep her job.
Why can't we let her clean her own mess up?
'Cause family is the only thing that means a goddamn.
You'll learn that.
Mamaw, I wanna stay with you.
Can I stay?
Can't do that. We're not gonna do that to her.
But you always got me.
Now…
do this for her.
Mamaw!
Mamaw!
Mamaw!
-[Mamaw coughs] -Mamaw!
-[wheezing] -Are you okay? Say something!
[J.D. cries] Oh, no!
Shit!
-Mamaw? -Hmm.
Are you gonna die?
-What the hell are you asking me that for? -They said you have pneumonia.
People can die from pneumonia.
-Are you trying to kill me off? -I know you know.
People know.
What kind of feather-brained idea is that? Who knows they're gonna die?
People do. Like… Native Americans.
They're called "Indians." Like the Cleveland Indians,
and they don't know more than other people.
They're not magic just 'cause they don't have microwaves.
Just tell me!
-I don't know. -Are you gonna die now?
You mean right now?
[sighs] Are you gonna come home from this hospital?
I just told you, I don't goddamn know.
Fine. Just go ahead and die.
Oh, J.D.
You might think that algebra is jail, but it's not.
It's freedom. Boil it down.
It's freedom. Boil it down. Balance. If it's good on the left, it's good on the right.
-Boil it down. B-I-D. -[bell rings]
All right, next week, quadratic equations. Bum-bum-bum.
We'll be putting those graphing calculators to use, so,
if you don't have one, go get one.
J.D.
You're gonna need a parent's signature on that.
You're gonna fail if you keep this up.
I think you're smarter than that.
-[Travis] Do it, man! -[Doug] That's it. Under the shirt.
-Breathe in. There you go. -[Travis] Oh!
-[Doug] Stand up. -No!
All right, one foot. One foot.
[all] One foot, one foot, one foot.
-[Doug] There you go. -[Louis] Oh, shit!
[Frank] Hey, check it out.
Aren't you gonna work, man?
[scoffs] Nah, dude. I quit.
[Travis] Why?
They fired Cheyenne. Said she missed too many days or some shit.
[Frank] There you go, Pee-Wee.
It was all 'cause she was puking, mostly, but that was just the first three months.
Three months of what? [chuckles]
She's pregnant, idiot.
[Doug] Guy's such an asshole.
Always bitching at me to take shorter bathroom breaks.
Anyway, the guy fucked me out of a week's pay.
Fuckin' Trent. Not even a real name.
-Get a fuckin' name, Trent! -[all laugh]
I was thinkin' about going over there.
Fuck shit up.
How are we gonna get out there?
Shit.
My mamaw's car is here.
-All right! -Hell yeah.
Fuckin' Trent.
[Doug] Let's go.
[Louis] All right!
Come on, J.D.
Come on. Let's go.
-Come on, man! -What are you waitin' for?
Who's Trent now, motherfucker?
-Pee-Wee needs a bat. Let's go. -Let's go, Pee-Wee!
[Doug] Now for Shelby! Fuck you!
[Travis] Yeah!
[Travis] Yes!
-[teen 1] Smash it! -[teen 2] All righty!
[J.D.] Are you sure he's here?
Well, where else would he be? He hasn't worked since 2007.
He inherited the top floor of this dump. Thinks he's a land baron.
-What the fuck, Ray? -The hell?
-Stay out of my house! -You're a piece of shit!
[Ray] Take your shit, bitch!
-Get down and talk to me, motherfucker! -It's none of your goddamn business, boy!
You're a hillbilly loser. You ain't even got any of your teeth.
[Ray] You junkie whore!
Don't call my mom a whore, you son of a bitch!
She is a whore! She'll suck anybody's dick that's got one!
-I'm gonna fucking kill you! -[Bev] J.D.!
[Ray] I'll beat your ass!
[J.D.] Let me in, you bastard!
Open up!
-What the hell? What are you doing? -[child crying]
Get outta here! I got kids here! Get the fuck outta here!
He's an asshole.
Why'd he have to wreck my things?
You and your sister are the only things I ever did in my life worth shit.
I don't know how you got so far.
I don't know how far I've really gotten.
-[Frank] We gotta get outta here! -[Doug] Get to the fucking car!
[Travis] Shit!
[Doug] Go, go, go! Go, get in the car!
[Frank] Start the fucking car, Doug!
-[Louis] Come in! Just go, Doug! -[Frank] Go!
[Louis] Motorcycle!
[Frank] Turn, turn!
[Lindsay] He coulda been killed.
They all coulda, or he coulda gone to jail.
He needed me and I just kept leaving him there.
What he needed was his damn mother.
I just kept running off with Kevin.
Didn't even ask him if he wanted to come.
Aw, honey, you got a right to your own life.
J.D. ain't your responsibility.
Whose is he?
[Mamaw] Hey!
What in God's name happened back there?
That lard-ass called the cops on me.
Why did J.D. think you was going to kill him? What'd you do to him?
Nothing. He said some shit. I got mad--
-Did you hit him? -It's not serious.
Should I have let him get hit by a car?
-If he wasn't being a little shit-- -You've always got a reason!
It's always someone else's fault.
Some point, you're gonna have to take responsibility
-or someone else is gonna have to… -Or what? -…step in! -Who, huh? Who?
-…step in! -Who, huh? Who? You?
What are you gonna do?
[Bev] Hey.
Hello? What are you doing?
Mom?
[Ken] What is she doing here, hon?
I don't know.
Get your stuff.
I don't give a rat fart what you're smoking, kid.
If you think you're hiding it, honey, you're dumb as a bag of hair.
-Pack up. -For what?
What are you doing?
-[panting] I'm taking him. -Where?
[Mamaw] To live with me.
If you got a problem with that, you can talk to the barrel of my gun.
-[Bev] You can't just come in-- -He's gettin' in trouble. He's in trouble.
-He's a teenager. -It's not just that.
He needs somebody to pay some fucking attention before it's too late.
What do you think I've been doing, huh? I got us into this new house,
-good new school-- -He coulda gone to jail, Beverly.
He's got loser friends and he's gonna be a loser if somebody don't do something.
No, he's not, and you can't take him because he's not yours.
He might as well be.
I want to go.
You want to go?
And live with her?
She's crazy, you know that. She's been crazy my whole life.
If you wanna live with that crazy old witch, go right ahead.
You two were made for each other.
Go on. Get your stuff.
Hey, Lindsay. Sorry to bother you at work. I've been calling you.
I couldn't get ahold of you.
Mom's not staying at Ray's. 'Cause she can't.
Big surprise. Guy's a piece of shit.
Tell me about it.
-Where is she at? -She's out by the car.
I'm trying to think of, uh…
I don't know. I was wondering if…
She can't stay with us.
Not in the shape she's in, not with the kids.
Yeah.
When you got to go?
[sighs] An hour and a half if I want to make it on time.
Take her to that motel out on Verity. She's stayed there before.
Take her to that motel out on Verity. She's stayed there before. I'll try to get off work early and check on her.
I don't know, Lindsay.
What?
I could drive ten hours and not even get the job.
Or you could.
But it just doesn't feel right.
I wouldn't feel good leaving you to deal with this shit.
Don't make us your excuse, J.D.
It's just the way it is.
I'm all right.
Yeah.
[woman] Lindsay.
Register.
-I love you. -Love you.
I'm going.
-Nah, look at this. Three in a row. -Yeah.
I don't suppose one of you deadbeats want to help me with my groceries.
Well, I guess you two are too busy eating my food.
Which one are you?
I'm Louis… Zablocki.
That's a Polish name.
You know what's interesting about the Poles?
They bury their dead with their asses sticking out of the ground.
That way they got a place to park their bikes.
What about you?
I'm… Frank?
Is that a question?
You got a job, Frank?
Had a paper route, but… got laid off.
Which one of you can spell Mississippi?
Out!
And don't you come back or I'll run you over with my car.
-You know I'll by God do it. -What are you doing?
You can stay or go with them.
[J.D.] What the hell?
Those are my friends.
Not anymore. You can thank me later.
Three years from now, those idiots will be on food stamps or in jail.
-Who am I supposed to talk to? -Talk to yourself. Works for me.
Your homework done?
-No. -Why the hell not?
-I don't have the right calculator. -Go get the damn thing!
Costs $84.
What, is it made out of gold?
Do your damn dishes! This ain't a hotel.
Not like that. You'll break it all!
All you do is yell at me!
If you didn't act like a shit-for-brains, I wouldn't have to.
Hey, can I help you?
No, thank you.
Okay. If you need anything, just let me know.
Hey. Hey!
Hey! Take it out!
Take it out now! Give it to me.
The hell do you think you're doing?
You do that again, I'll leave you there.
You're welcome.
Now stop stealing things,
do your fucking homework and find some decent friends.
-I don't want new friends. -Then you're not gonna have any.
You can't tell me that. You're not my mom.
I'm all you got.
[J.D.] Mamaw!
Now get out before I cancel your birth certificate.
Get out and get that calculator
or don't bother getting back in.
You're damn lucky that thing ain't busted.
If I weren't crippled,
I'd get out of this car, walk around and smack your head and your ass together!
-Why do you even want me? -Who said I wanted you?
I really hate you, you know that?
I don't care you hate me. I ain't in it for popularity.
You gotta take care of business, go to school,
get good grades to even have a chance.
Mom was the best in her class. What's the point?
The point is you don't know shit.
I'm talking about a chance.
You might not make it, but you sure won't if you don't try.
Why do you even care what I do?
I ain't gonna live forever.
Who's gonna take care of this family when I'm gone?
I thought your mama was gonna be all right.
Be happy, do good.
But she got tore up around here.
She just up and quit.
She just stopped trying.
I know…
I coulda done better.
But you, you got to decide,
you want to be somebody or not?
♪ Tuesday's gone with the wind ♪
It's just till we figure everything out.
Here. Let me.
All right, Mom. I gotta get on the road.
But I'll run across, get us something to eat. You want anything?
Yeah, get me some, um… Funyuns and some Grandmother's cookies, not oatmeal.
-And some juice. -Okay.
Thanks for, um…
Thanks.
Yeah.
[Mamaw] Are you gonna sit there?
Or are you gonna get up off your ass and help me?
-Got Meals on Wheels for Bonnie Vance. -Thank you.
Well, this isn't enough.
I told 'em I got my grandson now.
[man] Sorry, ma'am. They only gave me the one.
[Mamaw] Well, I called.
[man] I'm sorry. That's all I've got.
Look, uh…
I'm spread a little thin right now.
I couldn't buy my pills this month.
Can you maybe…
Let me see here.
Well, I got some fruit.
That's the best I can do. Will that help?
[Mamaw] Well, I'd take anything else you got.
Um, how about this?
-I really do appreciate that. -Mm-hmm.
[panting] Go ahead. Eat.
[J.D.] 125 or 140?
[woman] Uh, 140.
Thanks.
[Mamaw] Ah, shit!
-[grunts] -[J.D.] Hey, Mamaw!
[Mamaw] I'm back here.
[J.D.] Wanna see something?
I want to see these cans get on the shelf without coming down on my foot.
-I got those. -Oh.
Great, after that you can help--
Guess who got the highest grade on the algebra test.
It's the best grade in the class. Best grade in the class.
That so?
Yeah. [chuckles]
[sniffles] Well…
Keep that up.
Mom, I got your food.
Mom.
Mom!
Mom!
[Bev] No!
-Give me the-- -No!
No! No!
-No! -Mom! Stop it!
-Just… Mom! Stop it! -What are you doing?
-Please, stop it! -[screaming] No!
Christ, Mom!
What's wrong with you, Mom? Come on!
-Mom, I-- -Don't you touch me!
You get away from me! Bastard!
Christ.
-Let's get you to bed. -I'm so sorry, baby.
-I know, Mom. -I'm so sorry.
I know, Mom. It's okay.
-[mumbles] -I know, Mom.
[Bev] Stay with me.
[J.D.] "For now we see through a glass darkly,
but then face-to-face.
Now I know in part,
then shall I know even as also I am known."
Get the surp.
-Get the what? -The surp.
Can't have pancakes without surp.
Oh, my God, J.D. It's not "surp," it's "syrup."
-Surp. -Syrup.
[laughing] Oh, God.
-If you think that-- -You're so cute!
If you think this is so…
-We're not gonna be able to eat. Usha. -Say it again.
-Syrup. -Surp.
If I say it, will you get the damn surp?
-Say it again. -Surp.
-Surp. -Now please…
I love you, Mom.
I want you to get better.
-I know. -For you to be happy.
And I'll help you.
I'll do everything I can.
But I can't stay.
I'm not saving anyone here.
Lindsay's on her way.
I really hope you'll wait for her.
But I have to go.
Don't give up, Mom.
Hey.
[J.D. sighs] Hey.
Where are you?
I'm driving.
Back?
Yeah.
Yeah. uh…
Look, Usha, I'm… I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I didn't just come out and tell you all this stuff before. Uh…
Guess I was just worried that I'd scare you off.
Did I?
Not even close.
Where are you now?
Uh, comin' up on Columbus.
Columbus? Unless you drive like hell, you're not gonna make it.
I survived Tactical Driving in the Marines, okay? I can handle I-70.
Okay. I'm keeping you company.
No, babe. Just go back to sleep. Please, it's late.
Nope. We're doin' this.
Let's see, uh…
So, um…
Read any good books lately?
Yeah. Yeah, Cases and Materials on Statutory Interpretation.
Oh, sounds hot.
[chuckles] It's a best seller.
In boot camp, the only way you're allowed to talk to your family is with letters.
And my family, they-- yeah, they wrote me every day.
Mamaw's letters were just the greatest.
She would go from, "Jesus walks with you, J.D. Stay strong.
Don't forget that." To, uh… [laughs]
"I wish I had a gun so I could shoot that dickhead drill sergeant of yours."
[J.D.] My grandparents just left everything they knew behind
and started over with what they could fit in Papaw's truck.
Yeah.
That's… that's like my dad.
He came here with nothing.
He had to just find his way.
I think that's what kills me the most about Mamaw.
I never got to tell people, uh…
just how much she meant to me.
She'd been sick a long time,
but when it happened, I couldn't…
[voice breaks] Yeah, I couldn't, like, believe she was actually gone.
Wish I could have met her.
Yeah, me, too.
[chuckles] Yeah.
Where are you now?
I had to get off I-95 because the traffic was so bad.
I'm on some side street. I'll be there in about an hour.
An hour?
-You're not gonna make it. -I know.
I don't know what to do, Usha.
Can you go down there and tell him I'm on my way, please?
Yeah, yes, I can do that.
Okay, I'll call you right back.
Okay? It's gonna be fine. Drive safe.
[J.D.] Twice I've needed to be rescued.
The first time it was Mamaw who saved me.
[woman] J.D. Vance?
Yeah.
[J.D.] The second, it was what she taught me.
That where we come from is who we are,
but we choose every day who we become.
My family's not perfect, but they made me who I am
and gave me chances that they never had.
My future, whatever it is, is our shared legacy.
Good to see you again.
which supplied air to the aquarium, had broken overnight.
Our mother announced, "No school today. Save the goldfish!"
So we scooped out the floating fish
and put them in an ice bath.
Lowering their temperature slowed down the death process.
And we found we could revive them later.
We were very successful.
More than 50% were revived.
Come on. Let's go!
We named our daughter Einz.
In Japanese and Chinese, "Einz" means "love."
-What kind of bed is this? -My sister's crib.
Yeah.
Are you doing this for your sister? Or are you just following my orders?
For my sister!
-Do you really love your sister? -Yes, really.
-Do you really want a sister? -I haven't even met her yet.
-Do you really want her? -Yes, I do.
If she watches this video later, what would you like to tell her?
I love you, little sister.
I love you, little sister.
Einz was born out of Matrix's wish for a sibling.
Hello. Today is March 2nd, 2012.
I've brought my sister to the mall.
It's the first time she's left the house.
He was an only child then.
Why are you sitting on the chair by yourself?
Such a gifted child you are!
One, two, three!
Einz brought
the whole family together.
Everyone had been waiting for her.
Here she comes!
Daddy! Daddy! You're 40 now!
Today is Daddy's birthday.
And you have your new daughter with you.
Our family today includes my husband,
Dr. Sahatorn, nicknamed Top.
Then there's our eldest son, Matrix...
...and our daughter Matheryn, or Einz.
Such a pretty dress.
My little Einz.
I think that for the bottom bit, just drill a little and put this in there.
For the upper bit, we'll clamp it until it's flush.
Just a little effort, and it should fuse.
In our family...
we place a lot of importance on science.
That means, if we know something, we say we know.
If we do not know something, we say we do not know.
Just because we don't know something, it doesn't mean it's not true.
My family knows that I always used
the scientific way of thinking to solve problems.
We have a good head of the family.
I was once Sahatorn's student.
He is still my teacher.
A teacher for our children.
This.
Haven't used this in a while.
What happened was...
We were working on a project in another province.
Matrix, being in Bangkok, was the one taking care of his sister.
I had this bad feeling. A nightmare.
So I phoned Matrix in the morning and told him to go and wake Einz up.
But he couldn't wake her up.
On that day, our daughter went into a coma and was unable to wake up.
I wished I could take her place.
Take her pain away. Be the one who's sick.
I've always felt nothing could happen to her
because her mother is here to protect her.
It's gonna be okay, honey. It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
The neurosurgeon said it is probably ependymoblastoma.
No one had ever survived it.
Einz has the deadliest brain cancer in the world.
Since the day she fell into a coma, Einz underwent ten surgeries,
twelve rounds of chemo, and 20 rounds of radiation.
She was in and out of comas. Always in and out of the ICU and PICU.
But through it all, she always woke with a smile.
Everyone waited for Einz's smile.
-Here comes Ei-Ei! -Here comes Ei-Ei!
My heart was rebelling. Maybe there was a chance.
So we had to keep fighting until we were sure there was no chance.
I didn't have the right to decide.
She did. She had the right to decide whether she would keep fighting.
I discovered that my husband had this powerful love.
Throughout 100 days of illness, he never got a full night's sleep,
because he was researching the latest technology and treatments.
I've started collecting her cancer cells from surgery to culture.
But I'm not an expert in this field so I've experienced many obstacles.
But what's important is that I don't give up.
Even if the chances of success are low, I have to keep working on it.
I experimented with around five kinds of chemicals
as well as other treatments
that had the possibility of curing my baby.
You mean...
you will place this camera here to observe the cell culture.
Yes, to see if the cells are normal.
Then when we're done, we prepare the tissues here.
After that, we bring the different cells to the hypoxia closet.
There's so much suffering in life.
We are under so much pressure as we fight this.
As scientists, we know the chances
of finding the right medicine in time are slim.
I began to think, what if the doctors can't find a cure?
Can't find a way. What should we do?
That's when cryonics entered my mind.
I've always loved this area of science since I was a kid.
I've always known what cryonics was.
Cryonics is a process
that preserves bodies of living things.
This was the way to keep her. We must keep her.
When everyone learned about cryonics,
her grandparents wondered, "Why we would do this? What is it?
That death is death.
What was the point of doing this?"
Can we stop the process of dying? Yes.
Can you believe that we can stop it? This is what I have to show my family.
They asked, "Even if we can preserve her, has anyone been brought back to life?"
Growing up in an Asian family...
I believe we have souls.
There was conflict within me about that.
I do believe that our souls can be reborn.
But we all still disagreed with one another.
He said he wanted to give her
a chance at a life in the future.
I know in my heart that she can be preserved.
The way my husband told me...
showed clearly
that he was doing this out of love for his daughter.
I spent many months trying to persuade my wife until she agreed.
She said we could do this, not because it might or might not work...
but we'd do it because I asked to.
The one thing that helped even those who have no knowledge
of the technology to understand us is our love for her.
He knew well from looking at the medical reports.
We knew in our hearts that she would pass away.
She'd gone as far as humanly possible.
The doctors admitted that she would not survive.
PEDIATRICS 2
We have reached the end.
The end of what's medically, humanly possible.
There's no more. We have reached the limit.
You are in our hearts, always.
If one day, you wake up and watch this video,
maybe many hundreds of years from now,
we want you to know we love you.
On her last day, we were with her. Everyone in our family was with her.
We asked for Einz to die at home.
We prayed over her and told her we loved her.
And prayed that we will see her again.
Dear all beings, our friends in sin who are born, age, suffer and die.
May you find contentment. May you find contentment.
May there be no bad fate.
May you find contentment, have no pain in your body and your heart.
May you be content in body and mind. Take care of your mind and soul.
Find contentment in both. Forever and beyond.
May you find so much happiness.
You can go now, little fighter.
Matrix has described that day as
being in slow motion.
Everything repeating itself, creating a wound in his heart.
At the time that Einz passed, the doctor examined her immediately...
and he pronounced her dead.
Then we began the cryonics process.
Einz's body temperature decreased...
until we closed the capsule and sent her to America.
At that moment, I was grieving beyond words.
I told her, "Come back and be my daughter again.
Mommy loves you so much."
This is the dress my whole family loves, especially her father.
When he saw it, he said right away he wanted to buy it for Einz.
While awaiting her birth, we named her Einz.
Einz was our beloved.
We bought this dress in two sizes.
A size for a one-year-old, and a bigger one for a three-year-old.
Einz wore this white dress even when it was too big for her.
She wore it nearly every day, for every special occasion,
for her first and second birthdays.
But Einz didn't live long enough
to wear it on her third birthday.
On days we feel discouraged,
or exhausted and want to hug Einz...
we hug this white dress.
Because it feels like Einz is here.
In Buddhism, we believe that when a body dies and disintegrates...
tangible elements will transform
into other things.
They are not permanent.
But there is the intangible.
It controls how things come to being.
Some call it the soul.
We cannot say Einz is truly dead,
but we now we have been parted...
and it will be very difficult to meet again.
I told my son, "Remember, your sister is there."
One day, technology will be able to fix matter on a molecular level.
On that day, Einz will have another chance.
-Did it hit the target yet? -It has.
E and...
I haven't fixed it yet.
Go ahead and use one line as the INT of the Y, okay?
And another line as the INT of motor X.
That way, you keep the code neat.
This is test number seven.
It's not igniting.
Test number 11.
Test number 44.
Test number 50.
Success! Success!
I don't need to adjust the focus or anything, just look?
That's right.
Our body is like hardware.
And the soul is software.
It's like we had manufactured
a defective computer.
So we have to put it on hold...
We believe that the computer could work again.
We know how to assemble the human genome,
assemble DNA.
That means we are bringing life to something that wasn't alive.
For sure, we are heading towards...
deathlessness.
That will be Einz's time.
Einz will wake up in a world without disease.
For our journey to visit Einz at Alcor, in Arizona,
we've prepared CDs, all the memories of her.
Like her first baby outfit, shoes, bedding...
all her stories, her toys, clothes.
If she wakes up one day, she will see the things
we've prepared for her.
It will be kept at Alcor.
I've already seen a lot of images of the cryonic facility interior.
So, I think that, through these images I've seen,
I have a vague idea of how their facilities will look.
It's not a grave or burial place.
More like a place to have a rest.
We plan to visit her regularly.
We are lucky.
It's like fate. Right?
Because the facility where Einz is and our close friend's house
are located close to each other. Only 30 minutes away.
Tomorrow, if all goes according to plan,
we'll go to Alcor along with our friends.
You're heavy.
FOREVER WITH US EINZ, THE LITTLE FIGHTER
Let me see. What are you writing?
-Heart. -One heart.
A heart. Draw a heart.
Do you want to wash it? Do you?
Matrix, did you take photos of the parts that interlock with each other yet?
Here.
These parts here. They're all important.
I still feel like a scientist.
I don't feel like the father yet. I'm still the scientist.
Okay, everyone, come hold this.
Here's Einz's dress.
Let's put her photo here.
We had thought that sending her to America was the last of it.
We would return to school, return to work.
Alcor wanted us to tell this success story
of the cryonics process for a child far away in Asia,
the first time in the world.
Our friends called us from abroad
to say our story had made headlines in their country.
We were shocked to see how quickly it spread.
Hundreds of outlets published the story.
It became global news.
For us,
we had no idea this would happen.
The program welcomes Dr. Sahatorn.
Welcome to our show.
Say hello to Dr. Sahatorn Naovaratpong.
Oh, dear, you froze her body?
And you sent her whole body overseas? That can't be.
Please explain to us
what this is all about and why you're doing this.
Cryonics is a process that freezes you, right?
We don't usually freeze the human body.
Let me ask you this straight. Forgive me.
Does she know her father's done this for her?
She was the first in Asia?
She was the first in Asia and the youngest in the world.
If Einz is revived, she'll have no one.
What will it be like? Do you think about that?
We just say,
please see from the point of view of a scientific family
who loves their daughter with all their heart.
Twelve! Twelve operations on a two-year-old!
Freezing her corpse... Freezing her brain, or whatever it is...
Can you please explain this a bit more?
There's a human that's frozen
and that person will be thawed in the future.
Is this something that can happen now?
This was really big news...
...that there was this father who chose to freeze his own daughter.
The head in particular.
Actually, you also work with cancer, right?
And you've also given to various foundations
or funds for genetic research.
Publicizing the research in this area and how you can contribute to this fund
are why I'm happy to be interviewed today.
The reason behind all of this...
is to preserve the parts of Einz's soulless body
that would help her in the future.
Then there's all the critics in Thai society asking,
"Are you keeping her soul from resting in peace?"
Don't you feel like it's going against fate, against destiny or karma?
Some might think, and pardon me for saying this,
you are imprisoning her, according to Buddhism.
Imprisoning her soul.
If they are just keeping her head and don't cremate it with her body,
many will believe she left to the next world incomplete.
She is still tied to this world.
Her parents haven't allowed her to leave without worry.
So, I accept that I have not been able to let go.
I don't care that people think we cannot let go
and that we still hold on to her.
This is who I am. I can't let go.
She is in a refrigerator where the temperature is -192 °C.
So she's still alive?
She's alive.
But without biological activity.
On the cellular level.
So you won't see her again?
If I only wanted to see her, it'd mean I'm only doing this for selfish reasons.
But if you want to give your child a chance,
to give life is to give opportunity.
Without life, you have no opportunity.
And that's why I'm giving her this.
What I return to is...
thinking about her body.
I refuse to believe that I have the ability to trap her soul.
When I look at video clips of Einz playing,
part of her soul is in there.
It's in the photons bouncing off her into the camera through some process.
She's saved in there...
and in every atom that has come into contact with Einz.
That's why I believe her soul is intact. Her software is intact.
And she may come back when those particles take a new form.
If she comes back to her old self, is that reincarnation?
That's how science would explain it.
It would be her rebirth.
Actually, our minds must be unwell.
The minds of everyone in our family are unwell.
But we willingly submerge
ourselves in our pain
so we can feel that
we still have her in our minds.
Today, I'm ordaining as a novice monk.
When my sister was sick, I promised her I would ordain for her.
I haven't decided for how long yet. I'm thinking two weeks.
Please take care of Matrix.
Let him go while he's here.
Matrix will cut out any longing.
He will share his problems with me only.
He can't call home and ask for things.
He will live like a novice monk.
I'm hoping that, by ordaining,
I will be able to send protection to my sister in the afterlife.
So I can find some peace of mind.
On this day,
I give you my blessing, grandson, that you will have luck,
be rid of sadness, of disease and depression.
Okay?
My dear son,
I hope that you find happiness.
I'm so proud to be your mother.
When we lose, we weep. We weep because we have lost.
Because we haven't accepted the truth.
Our minds haven't opened wide enough to accept the real truth.
All life experiences aging, suffering, and death.
There's no way to calculate
when or where you will die.
When they accept this truth, their sadness will wane.
They will be able to turn that sadness into strength.
I do miss my sister. I'm sad because I miss her.
I miss
the songs she sings.
I miss her crying.
I miss the sound of her calling our names. Calling my name.
Ordaining these two weeks means I can think less about the outside world.
It also gives my family some relief.
So...
it will help calm my mind down.
I've only dreamed of Einz once since she died.
I'm at this place where
the scientists there told me...
Einz's repairs are about to be done.
I walked over to her.
And I asked the scientists,
"Will she hear me, if I speak?"
They told me,
"She can sense that you are here."
So I went over and called her name, "My little Einz..."
She moved a little.
Then I had this feeling.
This isn't real.
I know very well the technology is not here yet.
He is sort of like...
in the category of a genius.
And his thinking is very different.
It looks like he's not that old.
That's right.
He's not even 30 yet.
Not even 30. Really? This Robert McIntyre...
-Really? -Yeah, I think he's only 28.
Matrix, sit up straight and stretch your spine.
Otherwise, I can't cut properly.
So what do you want out of this?
When you go to America, it is an investment.
And, in a sense,
it is... a trip
to develop yourself.
Okay?
In this self-development trip,
Robert is presenting you with an opportunity.
Since he's giving you this opportunity, you need to make some plans.
What will you ask him?
These questions...
When I read them,
I might say, "Oh, this question...
is it worth the journey all the way over there to ask him?"
But Papa will not come up with the questions for you.
Why? Because this is your duty.
Can you make the front a bit shorter?
Maybe cut it all off.
-Really? -Yes.
When I don't comb it... it falls in my face.
Then I break out.
Well, if we cut it so short in front, it will look a bit nerdy.
All right. Look in the mirror.
Can you see us, Matrix?
I see you but the video is frozen.
-Is the image quality bad? -Yes. Very bad.
-Hello, Dad. -This works.
When you call, it works. When I call, it doesn't.
Try not to make your face so wide in front of the camera.
Maybe today is not good for this.
Why is your hair so messy?
Okay. Let's try tomorrow.
I love you, Mom and Dad.
Try and look more handsome, okay?
We love you, Matrix.
Okay. Bye, Dad.
Hello, Dad and Mom.
Hi, Matrix. How are you?
I'm doing pretty well. I went to meet Robert.
-Did you ask him any questions? -Well, I had prepared questions for him.
But...
-But you didn't ask him any? -I did.
But I didn't ask all the questions.
However, my perspective has shifted a little.
-How did it change? -It changed...
The question I prepared was...
"How close are we to bringing Einz back?"
But after talking to him,
I found out that he believed in cryonics when he was younger.
He was sure it would work, 100%.
But now that he works in this field, and tried using the standard methods,
he found out that
even though some cells are alive and can function as cells...
Well, they've been dehydrated,
so the conditions of the synapses
and the connectome are broken.
Like a building...
that's been demolished.
Making the preservation of the memories
a very difficult thing.
For him, this means the probability that we can bring a person back,
with all their memories intact, is only 0.1%.
when he said that the chance of bringing a person back
with their memories is only 0.1%, I felt a bit disappointed.
-There has to be a reconnection process. -Yes.
We have to wait for better technology to reconnect everything.
Right.
Better technology.
It's a step further from just freezing.
Yes, Robert told me that it won't be easy.
Just for her to be thawed
at the right pace for detoxification, it isn't enough.
They have to rehydrate the brain, since it has been dehydrated.
And they have to reconnect everything.
Then, they have to give her a body and cure the cancer.
It is difficult. Especially difficult.
He said that it might not be accomplished
within our lifetime.
Don't think too hard about this.
If you believe humans will one day travel the universe,
then this won't be a problem.
Right.
It won't be a problem.
It's okay. We can be patient. We can wait a thousand years.
Hey, who knows, maybe time machines will exist then.
You are that happy, huh?
Your face is full of tears.
Why are you crying?
Is it because you have a sister?
Come and see your grandchild.
I'm filming you and your mother.
So that when you grow up, you will know that Mommy loves you.
When you do grow up,
you can't say, "Mommy doesn't love me!"
Remember this video. Papa is filming this as evidence.
Auntie Joy loves you, too.
You can't say, "Auntie Joy doesn't love me!"
Is that true?
Brother Matrix.
I love you, okay?
Can't say, "He doesn't love me! Daddy doesn't love me!"
Is that true?
It's okay if you don't understand now, my baby.
I'm recording this. Remember this.
I'm going to button up your shirt!
Perhaps reincarnation is real and she is Einz reborn.
Whatever the truth is,
we love her the same because she is our child.
She is healing our family.
"We are delighted to confirm your admission to
The College of Advanced Technology."
Our Father who art in heaven
may You always be with my son, Peter Andreas
may You always be with my son, Peter Andreas who is now leaving his childhood home.
May he never forget the plight of life
or his obligation to You, Almighty Lord.
Let him not be tempted by the decay of city life
and lay not up for himself treasures, where moth and rust doth corrupt.
As is Thy will, all that are bred and born in darkness
As is Thy will, all that are bred and born in darkness will one day appear, and sentence shall be passed upon them.
will one day appear, and sentence shall be passed upon them.
Amen.
I have saved up some money
which I meant to give to you when you left home.
But since you have chosen a different path...
...you get nothing.
You will, however, get a gift.
This watch, which my father gave to me on the day that I left home
I give to you, in the hope that it will soothe your hardened heart.
And open your obstinate mind.
When, one day, you turn away from the path to perdition
you will open your misguided heart to us.
-And to Our Lord in Heaven. -It's pitiful to watch an old vicar...
...whom I've only known for his inhuman rigour, seem so sentimental.
-You cannot refuse... -What?
Father's self-righteous piety? This gift of grace?
Father's self-righteous piety? This gift of grace? Apologise. Apologise for what you said!
Apologise. Apologise for what you said! Never!
Hit me again.
Hit me again like you normally do.
Beware! Beware His intrepid curse!
Since Father is predicting my future, he should know that in this house
Since Father is predicting my future, he should know that in this house I've always felt like a stranger and a homeless person.
-Exiled be he who defies The Lord! -Amen!
Peter? Peter Andreas?
Here is a little something for the journey.
And remember, if you need help, your older brother is in Copenhagen.
Thank you, Mother.
ROOM TO LET
This is it. The rent is due every first in the month.
In Darcy's Law, we see a crucial coherence in proportionality
between the water flow in the ground and the elevation difference
between two points. But what constitutes this coherence?
Yes?
There is an exponential coherence between the acreage and the water flow.
A proportional coherence. The larger the acreage, the larger the water flow.
What are you doing, Mr. Sidenius? It's a system of canals
which will cut through Jutland and connect the two oceans.
It will shorten shipping travel and connect the new towns.
In the middle of class? Have I not asked you to refrain from conducting
these foolish, conceited experiments?
The canals will branch off to the marshy areas
The canals will branch off to the marshy areas which can be drained and made cultivable by using Darcy's Law.
Listen, Mr. Sidenius. A young man like you
needs no other ambition than that of acquiring knowledge.
Understood?
Yes, sir!
Do you have any work available?
-Only for one night. -Thank you.
I'm studying for an engineering degree. I needed some money.
Unfortunately, they only needed me for one night.
-Do you often pick up random objects? -No, it's for a project of mine.
-What did you do before? -You're a curious soul.
-I used to be a model. -Really?
-For fashion magazines? -Stop it, you nitwit.
I posed at The Academy of Fine Arts.
-Like... Do you mean naked? -Of course.
-For men too? -Of course!
You really are a nitwit. There were only men present.
It was fun.
I would tease them by applying lipstick and painting my eyelashes.
Really?
Venice went from being an insignificant city
Venice went from being an insignificant city to one of the world's largest commercial centers
because they built a sophisticated canal system.
I'm calculating how to turn Esbjerg into a lagoon city
with elevated trading posts.
Imagine electrical gondolas sweeping through the streets of Esbjerg
carrying travellers and their goods. Duty-free, of course.
Right, nitwit! No more engineering stories.
He's smiling at you!
It's peculiar how older men are attracted to you.
Please be quiet.
But he'd not be a bad partner.
And consider your age, Jakobe. You can't live like a nun forever.
Besides, he's wealthy. So he wouldn't take you for your money.
Besides, he's wealthy. So he wouldn't take you for your money. Please be quiet, Nanny!
I enjoyed spending the summers in Denmark with my family.
But when the cold set in, I wanted to go back to Switzerland to the fresh air.
How long did you attend the girls' school, Miss Salomon?
Five years. I made friends from all over the world.
Jakobe speaks six languages and has a degree in literature and history.
I see.
Mr. Ivan, I understand that you've decided to seek out new talent.
-That's very commendable. -Yes. The future lies with the young.
We're always looking for new investment opportunities.
But why do we have to contend with the ill-mannered and failed geniuses you keep bringing home?
the ill-mannered and failed geniuses you keep bringing home?
Mr. Salomon...
Most humbly, I wondered if I might talk with you in private?
Of course, Mr. Eybert. Let's withdraw to another room.
I owe you an explanation as to why I'm really here.
It involves... I don't know how to phrase it. It involves...
...the state of my heart.
Would it be presumptuous of me to ask for some water or coffee?
Agnes? Please pour Mr. Eybert some more coffee.
Thank you.
Where were we? Oh, yes! The state of my heart.
It's my intention to honour Miss Jakobe with my affection.
Mr. Eybert, of course my wife and I have noticed where things are headed.
You come from good Jewish stock and are also a friend of the family, so...
Let me not mince matters.
I assume you've considered the disparity in years between you and my daughter.
Hasn't that coffee been sufficiently stirred now?
Oh, yes.
I also assume you've considered my daughter's position in life.
And my testamentary dispositions regarding her.
The state of her finances has not been decisive in this.
As I said, it concerns the state of my heart...
As I said, it concerns the state of my heart... You know that I hold you in high esteem
You know that I hold you in high esteem so of course, in principle, you have my blessing.
However, ultimately Jakobe decides her own future.
I have something which might interest you.
I have something which might interest you. A book, or rather, the Holy Bible.
It was a gift from the vicar who conducted my confirmation.
-A prominent man, rector Sidenius. -How do I know it's not stolen?
He dedicated it to me on the front page.
"Always observe the strict laws of the Church."
15 øre. 15 øre? I imagined... I would have thought...
15 øre? I imagined... I would have thought...
-Excuse me? -Yes?
-Who is that gentleman over there? -Ivan Salomon.
-Salomon? -Have you not heard of the Salomons?
No.
-The bill, please. -Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir?
May I steal a moment of your time?
My name is Peter Andreas Sidenius. I study engineering.
I hear that you're looking for people with ideas. Geniuses.
I would like to present a couple of my inventions to you.
-May I sit down? -Please.
I've thought of a new way of winning energy.
Instead of using expensive coal, we could utilise nature's own power
Instead of using expensive coal, we could utilise nature's own power the wind and the waves.
With a sophisticated system of canals and locks, it will revolutionise...
With a sophisticated system of canals and locks, it will revolutionise... Your receipt.
This will turn Denmark into a modern, self-sufficient industrial nation.
And I was told that... you're the person to involve in such a project.
-Do you come here often? -No, I...
Then we can continue our talk at some other point.
You must excuse me. I have a meeting.
He was right there! I've never seen anything like it.
He was right there! I've never seen anything like it. His elegant clothes, his whole...
His is one of the richest families in the country. Stinking rich.
This could be the chance of a lifetime.
Mr. Engineer... Come here.
By the way, I was thinking... Could you lend me some money?
How do I know if I'll ever get it back?
You know you can trust me.
The thing is... I need to go back to the café, in case he shows up again.
It's important. Have you considered, that if you and I joined forces...
Have you considered, that if you and I joined forces...
...and found a place to live, everything would be so much easier.
Yes. That's a great idea.
-So will you lend me the money? -Sure.
-You can have my tips from tonight. -Thank you.
-Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
This is what I could take home. The customers ate most of the red cabbage.
This is what I could take home. The customers ate most of the red cabbage. But there's plenty of roast pork.
And as many caramelised potatoes as you can eat.
To think, this is our first Christmas together.
Thank you.
I understand if you're thinking about your family.
No, quite the opposite. I was thinking about Ivan Salomon.
Sometimes, I wish I were rich.
Yes, but you aren't, Lisbeth. And you never will be.
Yes, but you aren't, Lisbeth. And you never will be. But what if I was?
I would donate all the money to your project.
I completely forgot...
-Cheers. -Cheers.
To you and me.
Mr. Sidenius! There you are!
Come and sit down.
I've asked my friends from The College of Advanced Technology about you.
-Are you hungry? -No, I...
-Are you hungry? -No, I... -Caviar and champagne, please! -Yes, sir.
Well, Mr. Sidenius... Sit down.
Sit down and tell me about your project.
Well...
Society needs someone like you.
Someone who proves that the unique and ground-breaking is possible.
I'm currently calculating the required water flow proportionate to acreage.
How to connect streams and lakes via canals.
You create an irrigation system and utilise uncultivated meadows.
-At the same time... -Please stop, Mr. Sidenius.
Come to my house for dinner. I want my father to hear your brilliant ideas.
-But... -Let's be on first name terms.
-Ivan. -Peter Andreas.
The project must be submitted to
The project must be submitted to Engineer Colonel Bjerregrav from the Danish Society of Engineers.
Engineer Colonel Bjerregrav from the Danish Society of Engineers. He can recommend it to the ministry, which in turn can endorse it.
You're a bit of a world conqueror. You're truly...
...a fortunate man.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was busy securing our family's future.
You're drunk!
Let me introduce you to my sister Nanny. This is Mr. Sidenius.
Mr. Sidenius studies engineering, but is already a genius.
Well, I never! What does being a genius feel like?
Are you just going to stand there?
Be careful, you don't freeze to the spot and turn into a lamppost.
I live in that direction.
I've invited Mr. Sidenius to dinner on Sunday.
Well, I'll see you then, Mr. Genius.
Remember to turn your feet around, if you're going in the other direction.
Don't forget to submit the project to the Engineer Colonel! It's crucial!
Hello.
I wish to hand this project to the Engineer Colonel himself.
The Engineer Colonel is in a meeting. But if you give me the drawings
But if you give me the drawings we'll contact you when the Engineer Colonel has seen them.
Are you sure...? I was thinking perhaps...
-Right. -Thank you.
-Will he look at all those drawings? -Yes.
Thank you.
There we go...
And, if you don't mind, I'll just pull out your cuff.
There we go. And the other one.
You've probably wondered about the condition of my clothes.
You see, I've just returned from a long stay in Panama
where I oversaw construction of a large canal system.
where I oversaw construction of a large canal system. -Quite dangerous, I'm sure. -Indeed.
-This is for you. -Thank you.
Well...
That's impossible...
I think I left my wallet at the hotel.
I'm sorry.
Why don't I send my chauffeur over with the money?
He'll be here within the hour. Good day to you.
You cannot leave the shop without paying.
Are you accusing me of being a fraudster? Do you know who I am?
Hello. My name is Peter Andreas Sidenius. I have an appointment.
Welcome inside.
-Let me take your hat. -Thank you.
Follow me.
Please have a seat here.
Managing director Delft. I'm the uncle of the family.
-Sidenius. -Ah, the young engineer!
My nephew told me about you. A fortunate man, he calls you.
Not a very flattering name in my opinion. What is it they say...?
Fortune favours fools.
-May I sit down? -Please.
My niece is very agreeable, don't you think, Mr. Sidenius?
Miss Salomon is beautiful.
Very beautiful.
She is certainly not a common girl.
And I can assure you, she attracts a large number of young men.
What beauty is capable of!
Besides, my brother-in-law Philip Salomon is not without means.
Because money, Mr. Sidenius, is a magnetic force.
Those little pieces of metal evoke the deepest human emotions
and the noblest excitement of the heart. Am I not right?
Well... Let's say hello to the family.
Thank you.
There you are! You are anxiously awaited.
Father?
This is Mr. Sidenius, who I told you about.
-Welcome. -Thank you.
-This is my mother. -Welcome.
You have a very beautiful house, Mr. Salomon.
And the wine is exquisite.
And the ladies... You're surrounded by beautiful ladies.
Cheers, Mr. Salomon, and thank you for letting me visit.
This is my oldest sister, Jakobe.
-Hello. -Hello.
Maybe you could tell us about your project, Per?
My father is curious to hear.
My starting point is... As modern society evolves
the access to energy sources will be crucial.
And he who holds the key to supply, also holds the key to the future.
We must break away from coal-based energy, which won't last forever
and instead harness the massive force and energy which is found in nature.
Yes.
Please continue.
Let's look at the infinite rows of waves
that discharge their roaring power on the coast every day.
Why not harness that power?
I want to accumulate that power and connect it to huge turbines
so that electricity can be sent out to the whole country via cables.
The same goes for windmills. All that untapped, restless wind which...
...whistles through the country, can be harnessed and be of benefit to everyone.
Imagine, Mr. Salomon, whole cities with houses and long streets
railway stations and factories, all illuminated by electric light
which we've harvested from the wind and the sea.
You also mentioned something about a new, international seaport.
-If you imagine a Danish Venice... -Thank you. That's splendid.
And quite expensive, I imagine.
How do you imagine implementing this project?
The drawings have been handed to Engineer Colonel Bjerregrav.
Father knows him. So fingers crossed.
Goodnight.
Your friend's ideas are fascinating. But he seems like a dreamer.
He may be immature, but he's an intelligent man.
I was particularly impressed by his predictions
that he who controls the energy, holds the power and money.
But is he someone we want to be acquainted with?
Doesn't he seem a bit disingenuous?
What's that word...? A scatterbrain.
I found him to be boorish. Did you see how much he had to drink?
Yes, he seemed slightly ill-mannered.
In his defence, remember that he grew up poor.
The son of a clergyman.
It's sad to see how being poor leaves ugly scars on a person.
It's sad to see how being poor leaves ugly scars on a person. And he wasn't as handsome as you said, Nanny.
I find him unusually handsome. I find him totally magnificent.
Magnificent?
The Engineer Colonel will see you now, Mr. Sidenius.
Excuse me, are you the engineer Sidenius?
-Yes. -Good God! You're so young!
Well, let's talk about it.
I find your idea of hydroelectric turbines to be utter madness.
But some of your solutions in wind power seem quite sensible.
How did you ever come up with this preposterous project?
I have spent the past year on it.
But it's something I've been thinking about ever since I was a boy.
Are these your drawings? Let's have a look.
I'd like you to elaborate on the control system for fiords and canals.
-Please speak in a clear voice. -Yes, sir.
I want to construct a control system for harbours and fiords in Jutland.
This would enable faster waterborne travel
which could turn Denmark into a modern industrial nation.
I want to move shipping traffic out of Copenhagen.
A free port here would never become a centre for world trade
as the location of the city makes it hard-to-reach for international vessels. I want to establish a large port on the west coast
I want to establish a large port on the west coast which would enable us to compete with Hamburg and Bremen.
which would enable us to compete with Hamburg and Bremen.
It would be a kind of a Venice of the North.
You are of a fortunate age.
And speaking of which, young man, posture. Straighten your back.
Let's meet again in a week.
-Am I dismissed? -Excuse me?
What a blithering fool! Authoritarian jerk!
"Posture, young man! Straighten your back!" I know the tune.
Clean nails, say grace, don't whistle, have nice table manners. I feel sick.
But he asked me to come back in a week. It's half a victory. We must celebrate.
It's half a victory. We must celebrate.
Champagne? And caviar, of course.
-Yes... -Let's join the family.
What's wrong? This is one of the best restaurants in town.
Of course...
My sister Jakobe's fiancée, Eybert.
...especially since the girls' mother died, I couldn't...
...especially since the girls' mother died, I couldn't... I don't understand what she sees in him. All clocks stop when he enters a room.
I don't understand what she sees in him. All clocks stop when he enters a room.
He's a widower, and his children must appeal to her protectiveness.
But I do understand what he sees in her.
She's the oldest sister and therefore the one who will inherit the most.
I made a point of being careful.
Mr. Eybert.
Hello. Peter Andreas.
Jakobe.
It's lovely to see you again.
Yes, so that was really something. That's when I founded the company
which is now one of the largest in the country in the field of sewerage products.
in the field of sewerage products.
We're ready to order.
Gentlemen. Ladies.
We were thinking caviar and champagne, what do you think?
-Yes. -Yes.
What's on the menu?
Trout roe and quails' eggs served on a bed of ice
followed by wildfowl and asparagus, omelette and cheese with celery
and for dessert, fruit. We'll take it all.
-Please serve the champagne now. -Yes, sir.
Per visited Engineer Colonel Bjerregrav today.
He more or less authorised the project. He is a terribly officious person.
"Speak clearly! Straighten your back." No, you do it much better than me.
-What did he say? -No, no. Please excuse me.
Still a bag of nerves? It's the last door on the right.
-Hello. -Distinguished company.
I almost didn't recognise you. And such classy ladies.
I almost didn't recognise you. And such classy ladies. The young man must be Ivan?
Exactly. And therefore, can we please pretend we don't know each other?
-Am I not classy enough? -Yes, of course.
But this is important to me.
It's important to my career, so if his family discovered...
...this thing about us...
Please, just pretend you've never seen me before.
In essence, I want to harness the forces of nature.
Of course, without exploiting them ruthlessly.
This applies to the hydroelectric system and the canal system which will connect all the corners of the country.
and the canal system which will connect all the corners of the country.
Let me ask you a question, Mr. Sidenius.
By all means. I'm curious...
You're studying for an engineering degree, right?
Yes.
How come that a young man such as yourself, who, I'm told
hails from several generations of clergymen
chooses a technological path?
-You don't care for my profession? -Yes.
It just seems so antagonistic.
-Science versus faith. -Exactly.
But is that contradictory?
Consider how important engineering has proved to be to humanity.
I mean, how it has shortened distances between people via the railway.
And the telegraph.
Not to mention that we might one day have machines that fly.
Consider how it can eliminate differences between people
Consider how it can eliminate differences between people and thus become the final step
and thus become the final step
towards our vision of global brotherly understanding.
Isn't that an exaggeration?
I'm convinced that free movement can break down prejudice
and create a regenerated, just society
and create a regenerated, just society where the individual will be able to live as a free and independent person.
where the individual will be able to live as a free and independent person.
I wonder...
I must admit to never thinking about my profession in such a magnanimous way.
Would you care for some water, Miss Salomon?
Thank you.
Ivan, you should hear this. The doctor has completed his thesis on geniuses.
Please, Doctor, tell me. I collect them.
May I, Miss Salomon? I wish we'd had the chance to talk a bit sooner.
Please don't misunderstand, but your wise words were so enriching.
In fact, visiting this house is an altogether enriching experience.
Although I cannot deny feeling a bit...
...inferior.
I'm not used to the open and free habits of your family.
Or rather, the way you're preoccupied with the events of the world
as something you can learn from. That's different from my family.
We began and ended the day by turning away from the world
singing hymns and praying.
Can you imagine that just being beautiful and well-dressed like you
Can you imagine that just being beautiful and well-dressed like you would be considered dishonest to God?
When I think of my childhood home...
...there's always a feeling of shame.
And eeriness.
I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Sidenius.
You haven't paid rent.
-You will have your money shortly. -A gentleman is waiting in your room.
-Did he give a name? -He didn't look very pleasant.
And remember to pay the rent!
Eberhardt?
I apologise, but the caretaker said you'd be back shortly.
-I've been home for a few days. -I see.
Father has suddenly been taken ill.
The doctor thinks it's most likely cancer.
I thought you should know. We, that is all your siblings...
We thought that when you learned of Father's illness
We thought that when you learned of Father's illness you might feel encouraged to
you might feel encouraged to or rather feel the need to seek rapprochement.
or rather feel the need to seek rapprochement. What do you mean?
-Can you continue to justify... -Don't interfere in my affairs.
Right! I see that I'm wasting my time trying to talk sense to you.
-As you please. -There's something you should know.
Although your stubbornness prevents you from accepting it
Father is more concerned with you than with anyone else.
He speaks of you every day.
They've given up trying to talk you round.
Instead, they're hoping that someday, life will change your mind
so you will realise how much you owe them, and repent and reconcile.
so you will realise how much you owe them, and repent and reconcile. Owe? Repent? Sin? I've heard that before.
Owe? Repent? Sin? I've heard that before.
How vulgar to use Father's illness to lure me back.
You want me to subject to you because you cannot tolerate
You want me to subject to you because you cannot tolerate that I might be doing well outside of your world. I am!
Tell the man who calls himself my father, that I owe him nothing!
He took my childhood. That's enough!
What are you staring at?
You think you'll be proven right?
At closer examination, I've found your project to be of no value.
It's too immature. Besides, you're too young to accomplish it.
You haven't yet graduated. Your name is Sidenius?
You haven't yet graduated. Your name is Sidenius? Are you related to the renowned clergyman?
I don't see how that's relevant? Can you tell me...
...why you changed your mind about my project?
I apologise if I raised your hopes.
I'm certain that by turning you down, I'm doing you a favour.
A favour? Your theory of hydroelectric turbines, windmills and canals is simply...
Your theory of hydroelectric turbines, windmills and canals is simply... ...too naive. Too juvenile!
The only possibility the project has of coming into consideration
would be if I myself got involved.
That is out of the question.
Indeed.
Well, that means that the case, as far as I'm concerned, is closed.
Thank you for coming. That'll be all.
As a former soldier, perhaps you could tell me
precisely how humble you expect me to be, before you will endorse my project?
Have you lost your mind?
Please understand that this is my final refusal. And please leave!
-You will regret this. -Are you threatening me?
If I had known what a pig-headed, narrow-minded old fool you are
I would have never submitted myself to this insult.
Goodbye!
Where have you been? What are you eating?
Sewage water? Waiter!
I told you to ask uncle Delft for a loan. It's nice of you, Ivan, but it doesn't matter anymore.
It's nice of you, Ivan, but it doesn't matter anymore. -What do you mean? -Bjerregrav turned down my project.
-What do you mean? -Bjerregrav turned down my project.
He mocked my life's work.
You're too young, Per. Your ideas are too extreme. You must go abroad.
My father is in touch with a large engineering company in Austria
which is involved in dam and canal projects. Professor Pfefferkorn.
They would like you to come work for them.
Listen to me! You need to get away from Denmark.
Away from roast pork, mediocrity and Bjerregrav.
Go forth into the world.
Find inspiration, get a chance to show yourself and your project.
Cheer up! Show them who you are. Show them that you're a fortunate man.
You promised to visit us at the country house.
-I know, but I can't... -Stop it. It's exactly what you need!
The whole family will be there.
Both my sisters will be there. Both of them!
Upon my word! Mr. Sidenius.
-Miss Nanny. -Oh, stop it!
-Miss Jakobe. -Mr. Sidenius.
Let me welcome the young genius to our holiday home.
I hope the train was on time.
There's just one thing, before the others join us.
Please, sit down.
Thank you, Ivan.
The money will be transferred on the first of every month.
And please keep track of all expenses.
Of course.
It's important that you stress to Mr. Salomon that I consider this a loan.
-Against the profit from my invention. -Duly noted.
Can I ask you a slightly tactless question?
I have noticed that Mr. Sidenius is changing lanes
as far as Salomon's daughters are concerned.
And that Mr. Sidenius is now courting my oldest niece, Jakobe.
It would be an impossible dream to court a woman with so many assets.
You mean the pecuniary assets?
-Excuse me? No, of course not. -Of course.
Please sign for the money on the line.
-Mother? -Yes?
Can we please precipitate my engagement to Eybert?
If you wish.
We feel great respect for Eybert. And he's from a good, Jewish family.
And Father knows his financial situation.
Are you sure you love him?
Mr. Eybert makes me feel secure. And we have wonderful conversations.
Besides, his daughters need a woman around.
Do you think that your friend would agree to
Do you think that your friend would agree to apologise to Mr. Bjerregrav?
Yes. And while you're at it, ask the Tsar of Russia to step down.
The responsibility of deciding the fate of such a visionary project
shouldn't fall on such a narrow-minded technocrat as Bjerregrav.
-I agree. -But surely...
From an investment and societal point of view
I'm very impressed with young Mr. Sidenius' ideas.
If we could harness the forces of nature that we thought to be an enemy...
But Bjerregrav needs to approve the project.
He's Denmark's official technical expert.
He's the only one who can recommend the project for governmental approval.
Father... What if you contacted Bjerregrav?
-Would that change his mind? -Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Let Per travel a bit. Go to Austria to meet Professor Pfefferkorn.
Then we can learn what he thinks of Per, and find out if the project is tenable.
That was impolite in the middle of that passionate song.
You haven't looked at me since you arrived!
I'm sorry.
Have you lost interest in me?
Is it because you find me childish and simple-minded?
Why would I do that?
I have plenty of other suitors, as you well know.
-I'm sure. -From better families than yours.
And with much more realistic plans.
Just be honest. Have you lost interest in me?
Excellent.
What do you want from me? Can't you just leave me alone?
Since we last spoke, I've thought of nothing but you.
Does your sense of tact not tell you to stay away from me?
No.
You have touched me in a way no one ever has. I need to know what you feel.
You're beautiful.
You're intelligent and rich, and I'm... I'm nothing.
I think you're overestimating how you feel about me.
I don't need to explain. My engagement to Eybert has been arranged.
Now, where have the children gone to?
They can stay here and play cards.
Where's Nanny? She knows we're going for a ride.
If she's upset, just leave her be.
Please move further along. Fine, then I'll do it.
Here you are.
This makes me think of the story of the young, Swedish student from Lund.
He made a bet that he could catch a stag on foot.
After an hour of running, he dropped down dead. His heart exploded.
Do you really believe that?
I heard it as a boy, and even then I didn't believe it.
-It sounds credible. -So you believe it, Mr. Sidenius?
I believe that a self-respecting man will accomplish what he sets out to do.
Whatever the cost.
The fact of the matter is that the deer is equipped with four gallopade legs.
It's not only about speed. It's about determination and stamina.
So you think determination exceeds the laws of nature?
I'm sorry to hear that you've lost faith in the power of determination.
What's your point?
Would you regain your faith in determination if you saw proof of it?
In that case, I'll do it right now.
Mr. Sidenius! Get back in the carriage!
Stretching one's legs is good for you.
Besides, think what it could do for Denmark
Besides, think what it could do for Denmark if a member of Parliament regained his faith in determination.
if a member of Parliament regained his faith in determination.
I can't let you run alongside the carriage.
Then I'd better get ahead.
You see, I kept my word.
Was that a bet?
I just felt a little dizzy. I didn't even need to run so fast.
Miss Jakobe, your flowers.
Your flowers.
You love me, do you not?
You want to be mine.
You want to be mine.
You love me.
Isn't it so? You love me and want to be mine.
You want to be mine.
Am I not right?
Yes.
Yes!
When the dam is completed
we'll be able to prevent flooding further down the valley.
It happens almost every year when the snow melts.
And when the power station is ready, we can supply electricity to the area. It provides opportunities for everyone who lives in this part of the country.
It provides opportunities for everyone who lives in this part of the country.
Mr. Sidenius...
Guten Tag, mein lieber Freund. I hope you're doing well in Austria
and that Professor Pfefferkorn is looking after you.
We had so little time before you left.
But even though the days flew by, love demanded its rights.
Every moment spent with you, I treasure as one of the happiest of my life.
My dear Per, it's been too long since I heard from you.
Just a few words from you would make me happy.
But I'm sure you're keeping busy.
All day yesterday, I expected a letter from you.
I was upset and went to bed at ten o'clock
and hated you with all my heart. Until eleven o'clock.
My darling, can't you forget about engineering for a while
jump on a train and get home quickly?
And kiss me. Just one kiss.
That would feel wonderful.
Do you know that you've never said you love me?
Just once, I should like to hear what it sounds like.
You can practice before we meet again.
Then it will be a mutual confession.
What's up with Jakobe? Did you see her at the table?
Poor girl. She's jealous because she wasn't the first to get married.
She's positively fuming because she's not the one
dancing her wedding dance with Per.
Tell me, my dear sister... Is that the reason for the rush?
-Whatever do you mean? -You wanted to be the first.
You never forgave him for rejecting you. You're bearing a grudge.
You're drunk!
Concentrate on dancing. You're treading on my shoes.
-Are you enjoying yourself? -Yes, Mother.
-Do you miss him? -Of course I do.
-Do you miss him? -Of course I do. Especially tonight.
-There's something about him... -What?
-There's something about him... -What? I don't know...
There's something about the rootless part of his personality
that we don't understand. And we haven't even met his family.
Do you know if they even know about your relationship?
Yes. Before he left, Per met his brother in the street
and told him that we're engaged.
It's not our place to interfere, but are you sure?
-Sure of what? -That you and Per are well matched?
Are you sure your relationship is not unnatural?
That your social standings are not too different?
That his Christian background will not clash with our Jewish faith?
His uncompromising hatred for his whole family...
I've made my choice, Mother. I love him.
Yes. Fine.
We just wanted to make sure that you were confident in the relationship.
Hello. Where might I find senior clerk Sidenius?
-First floor, fourth door on the right. -Thank you.
-It shows. -Yes, a Jewish tart.
Come in!
Hello. My name is Jakobe Salomon.
I know that your brother has told you about me.
I've come here to try to come to a mutual understanding.
Your brother, Per, my fiancée to be, has felt estranged from his family.
Is this conversation your idea?
Yes.
Does my brother know that you're here?
-No. -I see.
It's only too true that ever since his childhood
my brother has separated from his family.
He systematically hardened.
He's found some kind of pitiful joy in defying us.
Even the ones he first and foremost owes gratitude and reverence.
Even now, when our father is on his deathbed
he won't open his darkened heart.
His attempts to break free go as far as his Christian name.
-You call him Per. -Yes.
I won't hide my opinion. And I assume you're looking for an honest observation.
And I assume you're looking for an honest observation.
Namely that this, his engagement to you
is part of a rebellion against his home.
I'm sure you know that Peter Andreas comes from a Christian family.
He knows that to his parents, Christianity is the all-important power.
And that they don't recognise happiness, which isn't rooted in Christian piety.
And if it means anything to you, I can tell you in no uncertain terms
that you can't expect an approval of his liaison with you.
I came here with the hope of reconciliation.
I see now that I was naive.
And yet, I don't regret my visit.
Excuse me? Is there any mail for me?
Sorry, Mr. Sidenius. No mail today either.
Thank you.
Mr. Sidenius! There's a telegram for you.
Thank you.
Has something happened?
It's from my brother.
My father died in the night.
Please accept my condolences, Mr. Sidenius.
You are welcome to go home right away.
No thanks. As you wish. If I can be of any help...
As you wish. If I can be of any help...
-A lady wishes to speak to you. -That must be a misunderstanding.
A foreigner. I think she arrived on the train.
On the train?
Good evening.
How...?
-Did I surprise you? -Please, come in.
So you did miss me.
And now I'm here.
My dearest friend, Per.
A thousand times my friend.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I could have sent a carriage.
I didn't know whether to come. But I felt I had to visit you.
I couldn't tell my parents about it.
So I told them that I was visiting my old friend Rebekka in Breslau.
-And you're staying? -For two days.
-You must be hungry. -Yes.
Uncle Delft read your father's obituary in the newspaper.
I'm so sorry, Per. Has it been hard?
No. I was relieved not to feel anything.
No. I was relieved not to feel anything. Almost like an acquittal.
You two could have reconciled.
If you had confronted him, perhaps things had been different.
You and I must be honest with each other.
We must confide in one another.
I have a confession to make.
Please don't be upset.
I went to your room in Copenhagen before I left.
I missed you so much. I needed something of yours near me.
And I wrote you a letter. But I never sent it.
I brought it with me.
My dearest Per.
My dear friend.
I could weep with joy at how mortified I feel
because I have worried about you and doubted you.
Not until now did I understand the kind of person you are. What you are made of, and what made you who you are.
What you are made of, and what made you who you are.
Your grandeur is also a contradiction in terms...
...which has grown from the pressure of small-mindedness and superstition.
It explains your feebleness but also your immense strength.
Your disdain and wilful power.
Now I finally understand the importance of social justice.
Due to my slowly coming to understand you and your background
I have realised why I feel a dark and reluctant connection to the hungry
the poor, and the people who fight for light, air, and dignity.
Those people who belong to the future.
Thank you.
This is the life, Jakobe. A life of freedom.
I still can't believe that you travelled so far just to see me.
I would travel round the world three times just to have one minute with you.
Maybe now's the moment to declare it.
Yes. Declare what?
I...
-I... -I...
-...love you. -...love you.
Oh no! I hadn't noticed it.
-What's it doing here? Let's move. -No. We have our backs to it.
Just enjoy the beautiful view.
-Do you hear that? -What?
Can't you hear them? The church bells.
They won't leave us alone anywhere! It's as if they're following me!
Per...
-See how he flaunts his impudence. -Per!
Look at his abject humility and how he exposes his misery.
Look at his abject humility and how he exposes his misery. -I hate it! -Stop it, Per.
When has anyone ever spat their disgust in your face?
Stop it!
Stop it now. Per! What's got into you! Stop it now! Stop it!
Stop it, Per. Stop it!
Look at me. Stop it! Stop it now.
Look at me.
Sometimes I feel like the hill troll
who crawled out of his hole to be with humans.
He discovered that the light was too bright.
The sun's rays were too bright
so he went back into the hole and cowered in fear.
Back to the darkness.
Go to sleep. It's been a long day for both of us.
Well, Mr. Sidenius. Are you happy to be here?
Well, Mr. Sidenius. Are you happy to be here? Very happy.
In the past few months, I've learned more than at college in Denmark.
Good to hear. I've been studying your project.
Some details are disputable.
Especially the fascine revetment and the retaining walls.
And also in the draft for the fiord regulations regarding the lateral works.
And also in the draft for the fiord regulations regarding the lateral works. Of course, Professor.
But as a whole, Mr. Sidenius...
...I'm very impressed.
You possess an unusually fresh and graphic understanding
of the forces of nature and how to harness them.
Thank you, Professor. If you knew what that means to me.
Thank you, Professor. If you knew what that means to me. I sincerely hope that the Danish nation appreciates your enormous talent.
I sincerely hope that the Danish nation appreciates your enormous talent.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
My dear friends and honoured guests.
Today is a very special and moving day for me and my wife.
We are pleased to announce the engagement of our oldest daughter Jakobe to Per Sidenius.
of our oldest daughter Jakobe to Per Sidenius.
On a day like today, I feel like making a short speech to the couple
who have now said their first official "I do".
Let me start with you, Per, my future son-in-law.
You're probably the most stubborn person I've ever met. For better or for worse.
Mostly for better.
When I think about how persistently you fought to make Jakobe yours
and how unyielding you have been in fighting for your national project.
You went to Austria to study under Professor Pfefferkorn.
He unequivocally gave his seal of approval to Per's ideas.
Isn't that something?
And I'm happy to inform you that we have formed a consortium
of affluent people who want to support your project, Per.
Seen from a financial point of view, it looks as if
the project is capable of being realised.
You're fortunate man. I think the future lies at your feet.
Good afternoon, or rather, good evening.
That unpleasant man was here again. He left you a letter.
-I can only offer you water. -No thank you.
How long has Mother been in Copenhagen?
When your father died, I had to leave the rectory.
I had nowhere else to go, so I wanted to be near Eberhardt.
You look very elegant.
And you've acquired fine manners.
Your brother tells me that you've found a wealthy family
who pays for your lifestyle.
Eberhardt and I agreed to spare your father the distress he would have felt
Eberhardt and I agreed to spare your father the distress he would have felt at learning of your relationship with the Jewish daughter of a rich man.
A fortunate man, they call you. What manner is that?
What did Mother wish to speak to me about?
You didn't attend your father's funeral.
But until his last breath, he hoped you would return to the grace of humility.
He wanted me to give this to you after his death.
That's why I asked Eberhardt to look you up.
The watch was special to your father.
And let me tell you, Peter Andreas
why he insisted to his last breath that I give it to you.
As a young boy, your father was going away to grammar school.
His father demanded to have the key to his suitcase so he could check what he was bringing.
so he could check what he was bringing. Your father felt very offended, so he left without saying goodbye.
Your father felt very offended, so he left without saying goodbye.
When he arrived at the school in the evening, he opened the suitcase...
...and found the watch you're holding.
He realised that it was a gift.
It was meant to be a surprise.
Your father cried violently.
And in repentance, he walked throughout the night
all the way home, flung his arms around his father's neck
and asked for forgiveness.
It was on that night, when he humiliated himself...
...that he found the path back to the light. And to peace of mind.
And to Our Lord in Heaven.
Never forget what your father said.
Exiled be he who defies The Lord!
I think I'd like that glass of water now.
There's a kitchenette out there.
-And you're quite sure? -Yes. You're pregnant.
-When will you be finished with that? -Two minutes.
With love from Jakobe. She hopes the meeting goes well.
I've been waiting for this since I was a boy.
How many of your father's friends will attend?
Seven or eight.
-What on earth is that? -It was delivered yesterday.
I had it made in Vienna. Does it look like me?
To a T.
People are completely unaware that in a few hours, we will make history.
We are laying the foundation for the new national works.
-It's big. -It's a quarter to ten! Hurry up!
In order to connect all corners of Denmark
and make the regions part of modern society
we must break away from the notion of the blessings of pork and butter
and instead make the peasant society part of the whole nation.
And as I said by way of introduction, my canal project
combined with hydropower and windmills is crucial.
I promise that your investments will not be wasted.
When Denmark becomes self-sufficient, money will flow in.
Thank you for taking the time to listen to the plans for Denmark's new works.
This consortium, which is made up of private, independent investors
This consortium, which is made up of private, independent investors has done some calculations, and we have reached the conclusion that
has done some calculations, and we have reached the conclusion that
the project is financially feasible.
This, of course, is subject to ministerial permission.
We know that Mr. Sidenius has been in touch with a high-ranking official
and that the meeting for personal reasons
concluded in an unfortunate way. We have been in touch with this person.
And when, in a moment, he enters through that door
we ask that you give him the unreserved apology he's expecting.
Please, Isak.
Gentlemen...
Do you seriously think that I owe him an apology?
But what for? What for?
But what for? What for? You must understand that I cannot accept any kind of tutelage.
You must understand that I cannot accept any kind of tutelage. I drew up my project without any form of supervision or intervention.
I drew up my project without any form of supervision or intervention.
I cannot allow it to happen now.
Presumably you know, that without Engineer Colonel Bjerregrav's approval
the project is not feasible.
I want to make it clear that the Engineer Colonel insulted me.
He mocked my project!
So he should apologise to me.
Are you refusing to apologise?
Yes. I resent having to apologise to an old, power-crazed tyrant.
A legalist who lacks vision! I'm sorry.
Is that your final decision?
Absolutely.
Well, that concludes matters for today, gentlemen.
The consortium is hereby disbanded.
I assume that none of you have any regrets
about the outcome of this meeting.
Imagine having to apologise to that power-crazed, uncompromising person.
-Who was being uncompromising, Per? -You too?
Would a small apology matter that much if it could save your project?
Yes, in my world. I'm astonished by your attitude.
You always say that the end justifies the means.
This confirmed the rotten connection between money and those in power.
And that's apparently something you support.
What do you mean?
If I'm to follow your rule of conduct...
-...then this is the last time we talk. -What are you saying?
You're prerequisite by birth to value these traits which I seem to lack.
I didn't hear that.
The outcome of today's meeting
was very disappointing to my colleagues and me.
I refuse to be bullied by that tyrant. Especially on such an important project.
In future, please remember the position you hold
within my family, and conduct yourself with the necessary elegance.
And with dignity.
Am I being clear?
Yes, sir.
Jakobe?
-Did you hear? -Hear what?
Come and sit next to me.
Is your mother's name Kristine Margrethe?
Yes. Why do you ask?
She died.
-What do you mean? -I read the obituary in the newspaper.
I noticed that she was a clergyman's widow.
"Our dear mother, Kristine Margrethe Sidenius
has found eternal peace." It's signed "her children."
-Did you know she was on her deathbed? -I knew she was sickly.
But I didn't know it was that serious.
To think what a life she led.
With so many children and such a difficult husband.
And in poverty.
And yet, she never complained. I remember you telling me she once said:
"Don't pity me. Pity my husband and my children."
That which is gone, is gone.
Let's talk about something else. Let's talk about you.
Let's go travelling. Soon.
To England. Just you and me.
Let's call it an engagement trip.
There, we can live only for our love. And comfortably plan our wedding.
I have big news myself, which I look forward to telling you.
Go with me to the country house. Don't be alone tonight.
The guest room is ready for you.
We should both tell Mother and Father of your mother's death.
-We owe them that. -Now that we're almost related.
I owe them nothing, apart from the money, of course.
That's not what I meant. They've never mentioned the money.
It's something I've thought about.
I want to be rid of my debt and become independent.
Not from you, but from your family's money.
If the money's not a problem to them, it shouldn't be to you.
No, but I don't want to be indebted to your family.
Hello. I'm here to see senior clerk Sidenius.
First floor, fourth door on the right.
Thank you.
Come in!
I saw in the paper that Mother died.
Yes. I thought you were abroad.
How did she die?
Signe went to her room in the morning to comb her hair.
Mother was quite impatient and asked Signe to hurry up.
Then Mother closed her eyes and passed away peacefully.
She wrote a farewell letter to each of us siblings.
There's one for you as well.
Along with a parcel.
She will, of course, be buried next to Father in Jutland.
Her body will be transported there by ship tomorrow afternoon.
Prior to the funeral, we're convening for a family ceremony by the coffin.
Now that we know you're in town, we'd be sorry if you missed it.
For several reasons, it's probably best that I stay away.
I'm sure my fiancée would like to attend but she would probably be out of place.
-Nor would she be welcome. -You're right.
Peter Andreas?
Due to official duties
I'm prevented from accompanying Mother on her final journey.
I was hoping you'd be able to ignore your own obstinacy this once
and pay Mother your last respects by accompanying the coffin across the sea.
I think you know my answer.
For my son, Peter Andreas, in the blessed name of Our Lord Jesus Christ.
I write to you, my son, in order to try one last time before I close my eyes
to speak to your heart.
I know you don't follow the ways of God. But it's my sincere hope
I know you don't follow the ways of God. But it's my sincere hope that you will show your fellow men humility and selfless love.
that you will show your fellow men humility and selfless love.
May I have a pen and some paper, please?
From earth to earth...
...ashes to ashes...
...dust to dust.
-What a nice surprise. -I needed a bit of fresh air.
After my mother's funeral, I needed some breathing space.
I couldn't think of anywhere more beautiful than this area.
-How long will you be staying? -A couple of days, before I go back.
Duty calls.
I just came here to thank the reverend for his words at the funeral.
Not at all. Your mother was an unusually modest and conscientious person
to God and her next of kin. That's how one remembers her.
I cannot claim to have known your parents. I met them a few times.
We were almost neighbours.
Reverend Sidenius' and my understanding of the function of the Church were very different.
But I respect him. He was an officious man.
How does it feel to be back?
I've come with mixed emotions. I almost fled the area.
But seeing these surroundings again has made an impression.
It's overwhelming.
It's overwhelming. One can gather much wisdom from nature.
We read in the newspaper about your engagement in Copenhagen.
-Sidenius is not a common name. -I see.
I believe your future father-in-law is a very wealthy and influential man?
You're marrying into money.
Nice way to escape your duty to support your wife.
Father!
At no point has money come into it.
Besides, as an engineer I will make enough money to support a family.
This wedding, and I ask from a purely professional point of view...
A Jewish woman and the son of a clergyman, how do you...?
A Jewish woman and the son of a clergyman, how do you...? You're overstepping your mark. Stop questioning our visitor.
Would you like to try our home-made cake? Inger made it.
Don't be shy. There's no need to be modest.
Help yourself.
Well...
Thank you.
Jakobe, do you know when Per will return from Jutland?
He sent a short telegram, and then he was gone.
So you have no idea when we'll be seeing him again?
After the funeral, I assume.
After the funeral, I assume. We need to discuss certain principles and financial issues before the wedding.
Of course, Father.
You have no idea how much I enjoy having left the city.
I assure you that life there can be complicated.
Whereas here... Have you ever been to Copenhagen?
No, never, but I should like to experience a big city.
And see all those classy people that you know.
Let me take your gloves.
I have no doubt that your fiancée is not only rich, but also beautiful.
I'm sorry, I seem to have startled you.
-Have you come back? -I had some errands. And...
-Have you come back? -I had some errands. And... I found your gloves in my pocket.
-Here you are. -Thank you.
I've looked for them everywhere. Would you like to go for a stroll?
Yes.
...and the lock will ensure the correct depth of water...
...so that sea-going ships can pass...
-You're bored. -Not at all.
-You seem so serious all of a sudden. -I do?
Hopefully, you're not missing your fiancée too much?
No, not at all. It's because I'm back here.
Away from it all. I almost feel homesick. A feeling of happiness.
Away from it all. I almost feel homesick. A feeling of happiness. -Are you not happy in Copenhagen? -Yes.
-Are you not happy in Copenhagen? -Yes. Everything that I've worked hard for... And I've worked very hard.
Everything that I've worked hard for... And I've worked very hard. It has become my misfortune.
It has become my misfortune.
Well... I'd better get back.
Can't sleep?
Good morning, Reverend. Unfortunately not.
-Is it body or soul? -My soul.
-Shut out or shut in? -Both, I fear.
Come, Mr. Sidenius. Let's walk. Tell me.
More than anything, I feel trapped.
I can't sleep because I have so many thoughts.
I'm confused. I'm tense.
Is this a test?
Is this a punishment? The punishment for my life.
Is it God's judgement of my life? Is that why I feel so restless?
Or is it homesickness?
Or is it my father's curse that makes me so unsettled? Mr. Sidenius... Don't ruin yourself with destructive thoughts.
Mr. Sidenius... Don't ruin yourself with destructive thoughts.
You're your own enemy and gaoler.
Step outside your prison. Don't be afraid. God is with you.
Please, bless me!
Forgive me for forsaking Mother and Father!
And for forsaking Ivan. And Jakobe. I don't want to do harm anymore.
-Not like this. Stand up. -I deserve the punishment.
Humility is Heaven's price for providing peace of the soul.
You have taken the first step on the path to awareness and humility.
Stay here for a while when I leave.
Cry if you feel like it.
I shall leave you now.
Mr. Sidenius, is that you?
Father and Mother are on a visit, but they'll be back shortly.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
You're engaged to be married.
Don't you understand?
You want to be mine.
It's lovely that you're back from Jutland. I missed you so much.
I tried to persuade Mother and Father to return early from the country house.
I wanted to be here when you came back.
But you know how Father enjoys spending time away from the city.
-Will you go there with me tonight? -Yes.
This is where my bridal dress is being made.
And that's all I'm telling. It will be simple and elegant.
I picked up the tickets to England.
First, we'll take the train to Esbjerg and then get on the boat to Harwich.
And then it'll be just me and you. Our engagement trip. I can't wait.
Aren't you excited about my big news?
You look so serious. Are you still thinking about your mother's funeral?
Yes, of course, but Jakobe...
We need to talk. If it's about the wedding, Father wants you to get in touch as soon as possible.
If it's about the wedding, Father wants you to get in touch as soon as possible.
He wants to meet with you and the solicitor.
Thank you.
No, it's more serious than that.
Jakobe... You're the most perfect person I've ever met.
You've meant so much to me. No one has meant more to me.
But we're facing a huge decision.
Lately, I've been thinking...
I've been thinking whether...
Whether we belong together.
And whether we've ever belonged together.
Perhaps the whole thing was just a notion on my part.
-On your part? -Yes.
Yes. Maybe it was all a mistake, because I insisted too hard.
And lately, I've been thinking that perhaps we're too different.
And that perhaps we'd never be truly happy together.
In the long run.
You don't think we could?
I have my doubts.
So it's probably for the best
that we end it now, before any harm has come to anyone.
So you break off the engagement?
I'm very sorry, Jakobe.
How can you speak of...
How can you speak of our relationship as something which only existed
How can you speak of our relationship as something which only existed because you wanted it to? As if I never loved you?
because you wanted it to? As if I never loved you?
Don't you understand that I almost perished with love
and longing for you?
Perhaps you don't understand what it means to love another person.
Maybe you only know the unfavourable side of passion.
Self-absorption and conceitedness.
You see, we're too different.
Right?
Why don't you just come out with it?
I beseech you, at least be honest.
Is there someone else?
You're just pointing out that we're too different.
Tell me the truth!
I would respect you if you'd just be honest this one time.
Just admit that you're in love with someone else!
I guess that's the Sidenius family's trait.
That your inner, stunted emotions need to be so solemn. Good Lord!
They only cover up your vanity.
Your immaturity.
I understand that you're angry, Jakobe. I really do understand.
And I'm sorry it had to end this way. I really am.
At least I won't have to take your barbaric name.
Please tell your father that I intend to repay every penny
of the money he lent me.
With compound interest.
Anna? Please have these delivered to Mr. Sidenius.
Yes, Miss Salomon.
Please insert this advertisement in the Berlingske Gazette.
"Philip Salomon and his wife regret to announce
that the engagement of their daughter Jakobe
to Mr. Sidenius has been called off."
-Is this a joke? -No, unfortunately not.
Why wasn't I told?
We were never particularly taken by this...
What about his project? Our investment! He signed a contract which clearly outlined the conditions of repayment.
He signed a contract which clearly outlined the conditions of repayment.
As security for the loan, I'd give you the patent for my invention.
I'd appreciate it if the money was paid out as soon as possible.
I don't know the value of your machines. My decision is influenced by the fact that I've recently learned
My decision is influenced by the fact that I've recently learned
that your engagement to Miss Salomon has been called off.
That's why I suggested...
On principle, we as a business never get involved in anything
if we can't get a bank security.
So unfortunately, Mr. Sidenius, we're unable to grant you a loan.
Mother?
Yes, child.
Remember, I talked about visiting my friend Rebekka in Breslau?
-Yes. -I think I'd like to do that now.
But I don't have enough money for the journey. Will you ask Father for help?
-When will you be leaving? -As soon as possible.
-When will you be leaving? -As soon as possible. Perhaps tomorrow.
So that's why it's been so hard to reach you.
Has it? I apologise.
Does anyone know? Not even your sister or Ivan?
Only Rebekka knows. She knows a good doctor.
Don't trouble Father with this. I'll get you the money for everything.
And make sure to rest afterwards.
If anyone asks, we'll say you needed to get away, after Per broke it off.
How do you expect to carry out the project now? Without Salomon?
Without the banking sector and the manufacturing sector's man?
And what about Bjerregrav? You're mad.
-How about a small loan? -And what would you need that for?
I owe Salomon money, and I'm getting married in Jutland.
I won't lend you any money.
When I heard you were no longer Philip Salomon's son-in-law
it made no sense to me.
How can an ambitious young man like you renounce such an opportunity?
It still doesn't make sense to me.
Jakobe?
Jakobe?
First, I'd like to make the apology I owe you. I apologise, sir.
You see, I currently find myself in straitened circumstances.
I ask for your kind understanding.
I was hoping you might once again consider my project
under your skilful supervision in order to introduce it to affluent investors
who might advance me the money.
I'm afraid it's too late, Mr. Sidenius. Thank you for coming.
You may remember me from the time when I was poor. How times do change.
You see, I'm getting married to a wealthy baroness from Jutland.
Since I'm leaving the city, I might as well get rid of these things.
You will notice that the suits are made from the finest Italian wool.
I'll give you three kroner.
The bust is part of the bargain. It's made by one of Germany's finest...
I can't sell it. And the books are in German. Nobody buys German books.
-But... You can have the drawings too. -I can't sell used paper.
No... And the way to God is the way of trial.
I have no idea what you're babbling about. Three kroner.
I have no idea what you're babbling about. Three kroner. Do you know who I am? No you don't, but let me enlighten you.
A son of God. A genius!
All that are bred and born in darkness will one day appear
and sentence shall be passed upon them. Keep your money!
But beware! Beware His intrepid curse!
Young Mr. Sidenius?
It's been a long time. Is there anything I can do for you?
Would you ask Jakobe to come down here?
She's gone out of town, and will be away for some time.
Look at the state of you!
Do you remember our first conversation?
Fortune favours fools, and success is the father of regret.
Well... Pride goes before a fall.
There you go.
That looks fine. Hagbart?
Stand still. Straighten your back.
That looks fine. Nails!
The other hand.
-And keep your back straight! -Lift your arms.
Receive the Apostolic blessing.
May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
-Hello, Jakobe. -Eybert. It's been a long time.
-Hello, Jakobe. -Eybert. It's been a long time. Indeed.
-You've been out of town. -We've opened an office in Germany.
So the girls are now fluent in German. They send their love.
Give them my love.
I apologise if I'm imposing on you...
But I want you to know that I've put all the disappointments behind me.
Time heals all wounds, as they say. All is forgiven.
I want to ask you, now that everything's changed
if you'd like to, when it's convenient for you, of course
let me take you to the tearoom?
Or to dinner. You and me.
Dear Eybert.
You've always been so good and considerate to me.
Can we try again, Jakobe?
I'm sure you would have been the most loving husband to me.
But we would never be happy. You see, I don't love you.
Damn, another disruption!
First of all, Per, how is your project for the future going?
I'm just finishing up a project for the new port of Esbjerg.
It will be the centre, or rather the junction, for European shipping traffic.
-There'll be docks, shipyards and... -And how will you accomplish that?
Well, the authorities are neither to be led nor driven...
I understand.
And when you're not working on your vision for the future?
As you know, I'm helping out around the house.
Other than that, I spend time contemplating.
The fact of the matter is, Per
that a small home like yours and Inger's with three children
involves expenses, right? Your bills are not being paid.
I'm mentioning it because I can't keep supporting you on my modest wages.
I'm here to work out a solution.
It's obvious that you're having money problems.
I insist on not having any tutelage.
I insist on not having any tutelage. I strongly ask you not to speak to me in that manner.
I'm here to work out a solution to your family responsibilities.
Listen, Per. Yesterday, I met the young, rich landowner, Mr. Brück.
He's heard of your engineering skills.
He needs some water regulation for the streams on his estate this spring.
I suggested he contact you.
-W... w... welcome, Mr. Sidenius. -Thank you.
My wife Inger. I believe you two already know each other.
Yes, s... s... since childhood.
-Welcome, Inger. -Thank you.
It's nice to be back here.
-Shall we walk? -Yes. If you'll help carry this.
A simple drainage system must be a m... m... mere trifle for an engineer such as yourself.
a m... m... mere trifle for an engineer such as yourself.
On the contrary. I'm happy to help out.
D... d... do you see possibilities, Mr. Sidenius?
Yes, absolutely. With a few changes to the bed of the stream
we can lower the ground-water level, so the soil can be used as arable land.
It requires some powerful pumps by the barrage.
They could be driven by mills. One per pumping station.
I'd forgotten that the meadow extends all the way to the lake.
Would you mind if I brought the children here, Mr. Brück?
No, of... of course. They can s... s... swim and f... fish as much as they like.
The rowing boats are there for that purpose.
Have you been here all day?
Are you cold?
I like your braids.
Did you do them yourself?
-Can I help? -Yes, you can give the children bread.
-Excuse me, who are you? -I was just passing by.
-Excuse me, who are you? -I was just passing by. -My name is Jakobe Salomon. -Do you know where you are?
-My name is Jakobe Salomon. -Do you know where you are?
-My name is Jakobe Salomon. -Do you know where you are? This is the YWCA.
I'm sure you understand why we can't have people of your faith here.
I'm sure you understand why we can't have people of your faith here. -My faith? -The YWCA is a Christian movement.
-My faith? -The YWCA is a Christian movement.
I understand. I'm sorry.
This is what makes it turn with the wind.
When the wind hits it, the sails rotate like this.
That creates electricity, which creates a current.
Do you understand? Right there.
No!
You broke it! Get down! Don't be so clumsy! And apologise to Father.
Get down! Don't be so clumsy! And apologise to Father.
Apologise to Father!
Apologise to Father, Hagbart.
Hagbart! You come back and apologise to Father!
-Are the children asleep? -Ingeborg and Lise are fast asleep.
Hagbart complains of a stomach ache.
I'm sure he'll go to sleep soon.
Please, will you not speak so harshly to him?
He's a sensitive boy.
Sure.
He's a clever little boy who misses his father.
-Are you coming to bed? -When I've read the paper.
-Goodnight, dear. -Goodnight.
I know I've disappointed you by not getting married and having children.
Instead, in accordance with our family tradition, I want to help the needy.
So I've decided to found a charity school here in Copenhagen.
I know it will cost me my whole inheritance.
But since I have no one to leave it to
I can't think of a more meaningful way of spending it.
-Miss Salomon, we're ready. -Gather round, children! Come here.
You need to face this way.
And move that way a little. I think we're ready.
-Look at that handsome gentleman. -Look into the box.
And stand completely still. One, two, three... Thank you!
Our children hardly ever see their parents. They work all day.
Normal schools are so wretched, they seem more like penal institutions.
Children in need are brutalised by police who send them to the poorhouse.
And the one person who could teach them wisdom the vicar, speaks only of doomsday and hell.
the vicar, speaks only of doomsday and hell.
So how will these children ever learn to love their neighbours
and become decent human beings?
Little by little, I want to turn the school into an alternative school.
A place of refuge, a sanctuary.
I have personally observed how a bad childhood can scar a person.
I wanted to create a place, which can help break the social inheritance.
Come in, Hagbart.
Mother told me to say goodnight to you.
Yes. Come in.
I made this because I broke the other mill.
Thank you.
You're not afraid of Father, are you?
You and I will work it out.
Do you want me to leave?
Why do you ask?
You seem as if you'd rather be on your own.
I know you're having a hard time. Can't you speak to my father?
Maybe he can help you find solace in God.
Wherever I've searched for Him, I've only found myself.
God is superfluous to he who has found himself.
What's wrong, Per?
There are people who are drawn to disaster.
People who can only find emancipation in hopelessness and solitude.
What are you saying?
I sometimes think it would be better for you and the children if I weren't here.
You must promise me not to be dragged down with me.
-There's the birthday boy! -You look very dapper.
-Happy birthday, Hagbart. -Bow and say thank you, Hagbart.
-Hello, Mr. Brück. -Hello.
-H... h... happy birthday, Hagbart. -Bow and say thank you.
-Thank you for in... in... inviting me. -We're glad you could make it.
Come in.
-Here comes the birthday cake! -Happy birthday, Hagbart.
Can you help yourself? Maybe Brück can help you.
I've launched the boat.
Perhaps you'd like to come and try it out, Hagbart?
It'll make for a nice afternoon. -A large piece for you. -Pass along the plates.
-A large piece for you. -Pass along the plates.
Here's to a happy birthday. And thank you all for coming.
Happy birthday, Hagbart.
He must have been a good boy all year to get such a sunny day.
His behaviour has been exemplary.
His behaviour has been exemplary. I need to leave. I forgot to tell the people at the lock something.
I forgot to tell the people at the lock something. Do you have to do that right now? It's Hagbart's birthday.
Do you have to do that right now? It's Hagbart's birthday.
I'll be back soon.
Are you satisfied now?
JAKOBE SALOMON HAS OPENED CHARITY SCHOOL IN COPENHAGEN.
Miss Salomon?
-I have a letter for you. -Thank you.
You came after all.
It's been such a long time.
So this is how you live. Here, in the wilderness.
I've felt alienated
and rootless all my life.
But out here, I've finally become conscious of who I am.
In my ungodly solitude.
Without it, I would merely have been half a human being.
A Sidenius always.
So now I feel liberated.
I've followed you from a distance.
I knew you were ill, but not that it was this serious.
It's cancer. The doctor says I don't have long to live.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Tell me about Copenhagen.
We speak of you often.
Despite the racket back then, Father and Ivan agree that you did the right thing.
One day, I'm sure the world will realise the grandeur
and necessity in your national works.
That's something I wanted to ask you...
Will you display my project and my model at your school?
As a kind of inspiration to the children.
Yes, of course. Of course that's where it should be.
The real reason I wrote and asked you to come...
I wanted to give you this.
It's my last will. Your school is the sole beneficiary.
It's 12,600 kroner.
It's not a lot, but it's what I've been able to save up through the years.
And I wanted to ask...
...if you find yourself able to receive this gift.
Why shouldn't I?
Even though you and I are very different...
...I'm not sure I ever really understood you.
But that makes me even more grateful for this gift.
Did I hurt you deeply?
I wouldn't change a thing about my life.
On the contrary, I feel very happy to have known you.
Only with the joy and sorrow which you caused, did my life gain meaning.
The school which I've created, is as much your work as it is mine.
Fair and very cold.
This morning, ice in our bedroom for the first time all winter.
The water froze on the potatoes as soon as they were washed.
With little pride and less hope, we begin the new year.
On the porch after sunup,
I could hear the low chirping of sparrows in the hedgerows
that are now buried in the snow.
Dyer has maintained that with good health and a level head,
there is always an excellent chance for a farmer willing to work.
He feels he can never fully rid himself of his burdens.
And I'm certain that because his mind is in such a bad state,
it affects his whole system.
He told me this morning that contentment was like a friend he never gets to see.
-You're late with the milking. -She wasn't suffering.
And you?
[Abigail] Since our acquisition of this farm,
my husband has kept a ledger to help him see the year whole.
This way, he knows what each crop and field pays from year to year.
And Dyer has asked me to keep a list in a diary
of matters that might otherwise go overlooked.
From tools lent out to bills outstanding.
That I have done.
But there would be no record in these dull and simple pages
of the most passionate circumstances of our seasons past.
No record of our emotions or fears,
our greatest joys or most piercing sorrows.
With our child,
it was as if I'd found my bearings.
But I too rarely told her that she was our treasure.
Would you like to try?
Like this, Papa?
That's it.
[Abigail] She often seemed separate from us,
as if she was working at just fitting in where she could.
"They saw his brothers and sister. And it was the mouse's family."
[Abigail] There is something so affecting
about mute and motionless grief and illness in a child so young.
She put her arms around me and said nothing else.
But it felt like we were speaking.
[Abigail] I have become my grief.
I have become my grief.
[Abigail] "Welcome, sweet day of rest," says the hymn.
And Sunday is most welcome for its few hours of quiet ease.
As for me,
I no longer attend.
After the calamity of Nellie's loss,
what calm I enjoy does not derive from the notion of a better world to come.
[Abigail] I want to purchase an atlas.
[Finney] Jacob, may I offer you a ride?
-[Jacob] It wouldn't be a bother? -[Finney] No, no, no bother.
Up.
Who is that?
[Dyer] His name is Finney.
His wife Tallie.
Met them at the feed store. They seem to keep to themselves.
They're renting the Zebrun farm.
[Abigail] Monday, February 4th.
Why is ink like fire?
Because it is a good servant and a hard master.
Did you say something?
I want to purchase an atlas.
I suppose there are more frivolous purchases one could make.
I've saved 90 cents of my own. I can't imagine a better way to spend it.
Could buy your husband a gift.
What better gift could I give him than a wife who is no longer a dullard?
My self-education seems the only way
to keep my unhappiness from overwhelming me.
Easy, girl, easy.
Good afternoon.
I've been using a broom on my porch. The snow is so dry.
I'm Tallie.
Abigail.
-I hope I'm not intruding. -No.
I needed to get away for the day.
Our farm is a slaughterhouse right now. My husband is killing his hogs.
Would you like to come in?
Yes, I'd love that.
Or we could just stay out on the porch, shivering.
I know it's the dullest of all things to have an ignorant neighbor come by
and spoil a Sunday afternoon.
Oh, no, you're most welcome here. But I know the feeling.
Sometimes I imagine during Widow Weldon's visits
that I've been plunged up to my eyes in a vat of the prosaic.
Widow Weldon. She got going on a county levy once...
[Abigail] She saw I had noticed her hair
and admitted she had been vain about it as a girl.
She said that back then, she'd worn it longer
and plaited in a bun at the back of her head.
In the winter sun through the window,
her skin had an under-flush of rose and violet
which so disconcerted me that I had to look away.
As always,
when it came to speaking and attempting to engage another's affections,
circumstances doomed me to striving and anxiety.
From my earliest youth, I was like a pot-bound root,
all curled in upon itself.
I hope I'm not keeping you from something.
No.
I'm glad you've come.
Finney saw your husband at the cooperage.
He mentioned his new method for farrowing his piglets.
With some asperity?
My husband mentions everything with some asperity.
I told him that once,
and he observed in response
that it seemed to be quite a favor to get a kind word from me.
And I told him that if he was married to himself,
he'd soon find out what a favor it was.
My mother always said that having children would resolve that dilemma.
My mother made the same claim.
And yet...
here we are...
both childless.
My daughter Nellie would have been 5 today.
Oh, God.
How did she pass?
Diphtheria. Last September.
God, I'm so sorry.
-Hello. -Oh.
Good afternoon.
I'm Dyer.
Tallie.
Well, it's late, isn't it? I should be getting on.
-Don't go on my account. -[Tallie] Oh, no.
-[Dyer] That's a nice wrap you have. -Thank you.
I never receive compliments for my clothes.
I'm so glad you've come. Meeting you has made my day.
It has?
Well, how pleasant and uncommon it is to make someone's day.
[Abigail] Thursday, February 14th.
Dyer's third night with a fever.
Drink this.
I plan on getting sick more often.
My wife smiles at me.
Promise me you're not gonna die.
That would be the opposite of my intention.
[Abigail] I've restored him somewhat with an enema of molasses, warm water and lard.
Also a drop of turpentine next to his nose.
I spent the day reconsidering my conversation with Tallie.
-We compared childhood beds, -[Dyer coughing]
mine in which the straw was always breaking up and thinning out,
and hers, which was as hard, she claimed, as the pharaoh's heart.
I should be taking care of you.
I agree.
[Abigail] Her manner is sweet, and calm and gracious.
And yet her spirit seemed to quicken
at the prospect of further conversation with me.
I find that everything I wish to tell her loses its eloquence in her presence.
So how did you come to meet Dyer?
He was the oldest son of a neighbor. He helped out on my father's farm.
And was he instantly smitten by you?
He was, wasn't he? He was instantly smitten by you.
He admired what he viewed as my practical good sense.
You don't countenance words like "smitten," do you?
I suspect I use all the same words you do.
I suspect you don't.
In speech, yes, because you're shy.
But I bet you're more accomplished in your writing.
Thank you.
Your good sense, that's all your husband was smitten with?
And my efficient habits.
That's all?
My handy ways.
Dyer likes mechanical things.
I have no doubt he would've been happier
had he been allowed to pursue the natural scientific bent of his mind.
Circumstances forced him into farming.
And despite all of that, his heart compelled him to you?
Well, you would have to ask him about that.
And what would you say if I asked you?
I suppose that as a suitor, he was
not generous, but he was just.
And that he was affectionate, if not constant.
I wasn't sure of his suitability.
But my family felt that more improving might be in the offing.
After all, it is a long lane that has no turning.
You both have much to be thankful for.
We do.
It's still too soon.
Sorry.
Tuesday, February 19th.
My reluctance seems to have become his shame.
His nighttime pleasures, which were never numerous,
have curtailed even more.
And I have so far refused to engage his persistence
on the subject of another child.
[Finney] Evening.
[Tallie] This is my husband, Finney. You already know Dyer?
Our paths have crossed.
-This is the Abigail I've been mentioning. -Evening.
My wife talks about you as if you're all about the house.
-Everything reminds her of you. -Well, it's all I can do
but sit cross-legged and morose whenever she's away.
-Come in. -Thank you.
[Dyer] It's rained so heavy that it broke down our mill.
Did you miss me?
Yes.
You look different.
No.
Finney seems agreeable.
Yes, he is when he chooses to be.
[Finney] I guess I'm supposed to offer a toast.
But when it comes to the social graces,
I'm about as smooth as coming down a rocky hill in the dark.
What my husband means is he's so happy to finally get together
and to see Dyer again.
Thanks.
Part of what I value about my wife
is how she's taught me to associate with my fellow beings.
Finney, that's a handsome necktie you've chosen.
Thank you. But with my neck,
my head sticks out like a chicken in a poultry wagon.
-Your tart was wonderful. -Did you like it?
I'm so glad.
I was worried I wouldn't have enough eggs because we had an accident. -Oh. -[Finney] Mm.
My hired hand pulled down a box of eggs and broke two dozen.
And I announced that he was unlucky to eggs
and no longer allowed to approach them.
[Abigail] "Unlucky to eggs." I like that.
I told him that his shirt had so many holes, he can make a necklace of it.
Well, we often wish we could afford a hired hand.
Mm. We've suffered from the carelessness of hired hands.
Mr. Holt's hired hand is said to have swum his horse
over the canal despite the cold.
Really?
Yes.
[Dyer] Winter's been so hard.
Sometimes Mrs. Weldon's son has had to deliver the mail on skis.
Now our letters can get lost at breakneck speed.
Did you write letters to Tallie when you were courting?
[Finney] I did.
And did Tallie keep them?
Only Tallie knows for sure.
[Abigail] Monday, February 25th.
Finney and Tallie's bond confounds me.
At times, when their eyes meet,
they seem yoked in opposition to one another.
While at other times, there seems a shared regard.
There is something going on between us that I cannot unravel.
Hold this here.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hello, Dyer.
Well, hello.
You off?
Yes, to town.
Have a good day.
She'll be pleased to see you.
Happy birthday.
-I brought you some things. -What?
Hand-knitted?
-I hoped you'd like them. -I do.
An atlas...
of the United States of America.
And a little pot of applesauce with an egg on top.
-My feet are freezing. -Let me warm them?
How's Finney?
He's Finney.
Uh, it tickles.
My husband records trespassers in his journals.
And this morning, when I asked him what he intends to do about them,
his response was so unpleasant that I resolved to visit you.
So that there would be something in my day other than his meanness.
Dyer thinks he has many estimable qualities.
He does, and he also uses a ledger
to keep accounting of whom I visit and how long I stay.
Why?
I have no idea. As he's gotten more like this,
I've given up trying to figure out all the peculiarities
of his... odd little world.
I suppose he's especially unhappy with me since...
I'm yet to give him a child.
What does it feel like?
Like nothing at first.
But then when she began to stir,
it's like butterflies flapping their wings.
Later, like a rabbit as she kicked her legs at night.
It frightens me.
The thought of having none of that.
And of giving birth.
Most of us feel that way.
But...
when the time comes, I will be there to guide you through it.
Dyer must want another child.
I understand.
Birthday gifts.
A box of raisins...
that needle case you've been needing and a tin of sardines.
You spoil me.
You got gifts from your new friend.
She left hours ago.
I just saw her leave.
[Abigail] The great storm began with a faint groaning in the northeast.
It was like the noise of a locomotive.
[Tallie] Halt, mare, halt!
Halt!
Stay there!
[man] Come closer, girl.
It's warmer over here.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll be going.
[man] You should wait it out.
Come on, mare.
Dyer!
Dyer!
Dyer!
[Abigail] How long would it be before I received word of Tallie?
How long could I wait?
How long will the feed in the barn last?
Each cow eats 26 pounds of forage every day.
You should know that.
They'll start to skinny down after three days.
Heard the newspaper predicts the storm will let up by then.
But that's probably based on an expert's consultation of a goose bone.
In a real crisis of nature, we're all at another's mercy.
Yes.
My mother liked to say, "We tumbled from one mortification to another."
When I was 7, an earthquake knocked down our house and barn.
Did I tell you?
Never.
-An earthquake? -Yes.
I remember something woke me before dawn, I don't know what.
My father was calling out.
But I couldn't tear myself away from the window.
I saw birds fluttering in the air, afraid to set down.
And the river was roiling, and I couldn't move.
And then...
finally, I jumped down through our collapsed stairwell...
as all my brothers had done before me.
And we huddled together in the dark on the porch.
Later, my mother said that the dread never fully went away after that.
She said, "What was safe if the solid earth could do that?"
My mother.
Tallie! You're frozen.
Tallie, stay awake. Stay awake.
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.
Keep your eyes open.
Keep your eyes open.
Look at me. Look.
I would die without you.
Then you're safe...
because I am here.
[Abigail] Monday, March 17th.
Half the chickens are lost.
I dug ice and snow from their dead, open mouths
in an attempt to revive them.
Hobnails...
for better traction.
[Abigail] The Widow Weldon's son, on his rounds, reported
that Tallie had gotten home safely, with, he thought, only a little frostbite.
We haven't seen your friend down the lane for a while.
Mm. Finney took her to Oneonta.
And so everything is tedious and lonesome?
[Abigail] Thursday, April 10th.
Biscuits and dried mackerel for breakfast.
Dyer has augmented the padding in the cattle pens
with his hoardings of maple leaves and old straw.
It always seems that Tallie will never appear.
But I remind myself
that time and the needle wear through the longest morning.
And I have noted that when she does arrive,
my heart is like a leaf borne over a rock by rapidly moving water.
Hello. Oh!
Careful.
Stay. Sit, sit.
[Abigail] Saturday, April 12th.
I spent the last two days...
[Abigail] Very damp, cloudy and cool.
Smoky.
Perhaps the forest is somewhere on fire.
Your nose is being gracious.
[Abigail] Monday, April 14th.
A terribly bad spring so far,
but the clover has come up through it and is all right.
And how's Finney?
The soul of patience.
He's mentioning again the idea of migrating west.
You're planning on moving west?
Perhaps.
I had an uncle who moved to Ohio and came to a desperate end.
Which is what one might expect from Ohio.
Tomorrow?
Okay.
[Abigail] Thursday, April 17th.
Rain in torrents nearly all night.
The lane is flooded and the ditches brim full.
This morning, only a slight shower.
Tallie came later than her usual time today.
She offered no explanation.
I'm sorry that your childhood was anything less than joyous.
Joyous it was not.
But I made my own happinesses.
My husband says, "God puts heavy stones in your path.
It's up to us to step over them."
Stones are what the fortunate receive.
My mother's mother was born in 1780 right here in Schoharie County.
I often wonder at the courage and resourcefulness of those women.
Imagine faring forth into a wilderness,
hoping to build the foundations of a home.
Maybe they had a certain high hopefulness that we don't have.
When can you come?
Tuesday.
-[Dyer] Hello, Tallie. -Good day.
Your afternoon gladsome?
Yes, it was, very.
-Goodbye. -Bye.
[Abigail] I felt, looking at her expression,
as if she were in full sail on a flood tide
while I bobbed along down backwards.
And yet,
I never saw on her countenance the indifference of the fortunate
towards the less fortunate.
-[Tallie] Good day. -Good day.
Are you sick too?
Not at all.
I was hoping to compare colds.
I'll make you tea and honey.
What?
Every morning, I wake up and I think that I never want to be far from you.
And under your influence, since you're so good with words,
I've composed a poem.
It's entitled:
"Oh, Sick and Miserable Heart, Be Still."
When I was a little girl,
I thought I could cultivate my intellect and do something for the world.
But my life has surprised me by being far more ordinary.
You're talking about that moment that I have dreamed about,
when we're carried in triumph for having done something wonderful
or received at home with tears and shouts of joy.
Do you know what I wonder?
Is it possible that such a moment hasn't yet come for either of us?
I think it has.
Or that it could.
You do?
So, what do you think?
What do you think about us?
-I don't know how to put it into words. -Well, try.
-I have tried. -Well, try again. What do you imagine?
I imagine that I love how our encircling feelings leave nothing out...
for us to want or seek.
I've presumed too much.
[whispering] It's been my experience
that it's not always those who show the least who actually feel... the least.
[in normal voice] It's my dog's toenails on the wood.
Why didn't you do what you attempted to do?
I worry you'll catch my cold.
You smell like a biscuit.
I have to go home.
[Abigail] Astonishment and joy.
Astonishment and joy.
Astonishment and joy.
You haven't accomplished any of your responsibilities.
-Do you need assistance? -No, I don't think so.
So it's a cold plate for supper tonight?
I'll milk the cows.
[Abigail] Friday, May 30th.
The sunshine streaming through the branches
makes a tremendous farrago of light and shade.
We hold our friendship between us and study it...
as if it were the incomplete map of our escape.
When the day is done,
my mind turns to her and I think, with a special heat:
"Why are we to be separated?"
Your smile stopped. Is it meant for someone else?
Sorry, my mind was elsewhere.
We need calico, and buttons and shoe thread.
Am I troubling you, sitting here with you like this?
Not at all.
I may be late coming to it, but I've learned consideration of others.
I've learned the need for human sympathy...
by the unfulfilled want of it.
I feel I've provided you with sympathy.
I suppose that's so.
Her smile returns.
[Tallie] Good day.
I believe that intimacy increases goodwill.
And if that's the case,
then every minute we spend together will make us more cheerful workers.
Won't our farms benefit from that?
Won't our husbands?
All our burdens will be lightened.
[Abigail] When she left, I was like a skiff at sea
with neither hand nor helm to guide it.
They're cleaning out the drain under the street along the fork.
And several people are down with fever.
[Finney] Holt came by to hang the bacon.
He still hasn't recovered from being beaten by two strangers.
He had to be hauled to his home in his cart.
He said the men who did it were gonna kill him,
but then realized they were mistaken as to who he was.
Lately, it seems like all you talk about are highwaymen and housebreakers.
On the contrary.
I often defer to your sensitivities.
I haven't even told you about all the reports in the county
of men who have poisoned and killed their wives
because I haven't found it a fitting subject for supper.
[Abigail] "Killed their wives." He used those words?
[Tallie] Mm-hm. Those words.
Have you had many disagreements?
Yes, about my wifely duties.
I told him that I was opposed to it, that I was not willing.
And he accepted that?
Well, he hasn't touched me since, so...
But I made myself feel better by composing a poem.
Can I read you the opening stanza?
You can read me the entire poem.
No, I'll start with the opening stanza.
I love flowering gardens I love creeping plants
I love walking in the air But I fear swarming ants
I don't think I can support the rhyme.
You see why I didn't read the whole thing?
I'm sorry.
I've always been contrary and maladroit.
Earlier, I felt that...
whenever I would draw close to you, you would retreat,
and that if I kept still, you would return, but you'd stay at a distance,
like those sparrows that stay in a farmyard
and won't come into the house.
-That's not how I feel. -How do you feel, then?
When I was in school,
the teacher had me read Cordelia to an older boy's King Lear.
Near the end of the play, the king and his daughter are imprisoned,
but he views it in a positive way.
"Come, let's away to prison," he says.
"We two alone shall sing like birds in a cage."
Imprisoned?
In a positive way?
Well, it may be that one has to read the entire play.
Well, it may be only in plays where people are imprisoned in a positive way.
You don't think there's a cage that could work to our benefit?
I just--
I only know that...
[sighs] I've never liked cages.
I hope you had a good afternoon in Shangri-la or Timbuktu,
wherever it is you've been.
It's been a busy afternoon, yes.
I would think. Five hours you've been gone.
I went to the drapers. I couldn't find anything I liked.
I stopped by the tinker for a sack of coffee,
but he's now asking 60 cents. I only had 50.
And I thought I would buy you a treat of some kind,
but Mr. Arnolds reminded me that I still owed for my last transaction.
So I was forced to close up my purse.
Tell me everything about your day. Don't hold anything back.
You're not interested in how your wife spends her time?
I don't feel I have a wife. I feel I have a selfish whore who--
Who'd rather wander off to another man's house
than contribute any labor.
Well, Dyer was off in the fields,
and their house is on the way back home, so...
So it's just Abigail and you tittering and gossiping away the hours?
Enjoying each other's company.
I have certain expectations and you have certain duties.
We have talked all night and day about your expectations.
I will not stay with a woman if it continually requires contention.
Well, then you shouldn't stay with me, should you?
Don't ask for more than you can handle.
[Abigail] Sunday, June 8th.
All afternoon, a hawk has been using a single cloud above us
as its own parasol.
To ward off others of its kind.
[Abigail] Our whole house now seems both angry and repentant.
God help us.
When three days went by without any word from her,
I stole over to her house to look on her
from what I imagined to be a vantage point of perfect safety.
By turning the lens piece, I could draw her face nearer
and hold it there until she turned away.
Her image provoked a sensation in me
like the violence that sends a floating branch far out
over a waterfall's precipice before it plummets.
[Finney] For the wife does not have the authority over her own body,
but the husband does.
Do not deprive one another, so that Satan may not tempt you
because of your lack of self-control.
Ephesians 5:33.
Submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord--
[Abigail] Monday, June 9th.
[Abigail] Merciful Father...
turn the channel of events.
Wednesday, June 11th.
Dyer has been silent all day, and I was happy to be left to my solitude.
Hello!
Tallie.
We haven't seen you for days.
Have you been ill?
-Nothing serious, I hope. -[Finley] Whoa.
She's been under the weather.
-[Dyer] Good afternoon. -[Tallie] Good afternoon.
We want to invite you to dinner again, this Saturday next.
But it's our turn. We should be feasting you.
In the meantime, please be our guests.
[Dyer] We'd love to.
Six?
[Dyer] Six it is.
[Abigail] My mother once told me, in a fury, when I was a little girl,
that my father asked nothing of her except that she work in the garden,
harvest the produce, preserve the fruit,
tend the poultry, milk the cows, manage the household duties
and help out in the fields when needed.
She said she appeared in his ledger only when she purchased a dress.
Am I anywhere in there?
I'm recording spring expenses.
[Abigail] And how have things changed?
Daughters are married off so young that everywhere you look,
a slender and unwilling girl is being forced to stem a sea of tribulations
before she is even full-grown in height.
That's its purpose!
Come on. Come on.
[Abigail] Morning.
Morning, Jim.
Morning, ma'am. I've got a new book for you.
You know, I'd actually like to see that blue dress you have there.
All right, lady.
It's two and a half.
I'll take it.
My change?
Thank you.
The Mannings' eldest daughter tipped over an oil lamp and it set the house ablaze.
-[woman] Fire! -[Abigail] Ho, ho.
[man] Fire!
[Abigail] Before she was driven from the house by the flames,
she heard calls from her sister who was trapped in the upper loft.
[man] Come on!
[woman wailing] No!
[Abigail] Just another minute.
Just another--
[woman] Get her out!
Get her out!
Get her out of there!
Get her out!
Get her out!
No!
Your wife's to be commended on her hospitality and cooking.
I can recall the day...
No, thank you.
when every family was fed, clothed, shod, sheltered
and warmed from the products a good wife gathered within her own fence line.
[Dyer] I heard down by the loggers
Mrs. Manning's oldest got fiercely burned in a house fire.
-Cassie. -[Tallie] And died.
[Abigail] Yes, she did.
Well, as my father used to say:
"The supreme disposer of all events does sometimes disappoint our earthly hopes."
What a marvelous hanging lamp.
Finney purchased it so that everyone could read with equal ease all around the room.
I wasn't brought up to read over much.
But I do believe a father should give his children every chance to improve.
Children being a sore point in this household.
And yours, I'd expect.
You'll have to forgive my husband.
Even so... whatever misfortunes arrive at my doorstep,
I seek to improve my lot with my own industry.
I--
I study my options closely,
and I just attend to everything with more vehemence.
Well, then you should be commended for that.
I'll give you an example.
When I first began farming,
I was so vexed at my own inability to stop my dogs barking
that one January, during a storm,
I held the dog around the corner of the barn in a gale
until it froze to death.
I nearly froze to death myself, at least froze my hands,
even with my heavy work gloves.
That is reprehensible.
[Dyer] Did I see outside that you use an old shovel plow?
Well, since you're interested in my machinery...
I have a hinged harrow that's been giving me trouble.
The spikes catch the rocks and roots, and they break off.
Well, our harrow has upright discs.
Work better?
Yeah, it seems to.
Bring the desserts.
I think we're stuffed.
My husband insists on his pastries and preserved fruits and creams.
Well, good.
What is happening? Are you in danger?
-What happened to your neck? -Oh, I just took a fall over a fence.
I hadn't heard.
Well, there are many things about which you haven't heard.
[Abigail] Back at the table, Tallie kept strict custody of her eyes.
Her husband's mood seemed to have darkened.
He served the pastries and creams himself...
leaving only her plate empty.
Saturday, June 21st.
My heart a maelstrom.
My head a bedlam.
A whole week and no visit from Tallie.
No word.
My anxieties often force me to stop my work
and pace the house like an inmate.
I have to see her.
Tallie!
Tallie!
What has happened?
They're gone.
And no goodbye?
We need to call the sheriff.
And report what exactly? That our neighbors moved?
It's the Zebrun farm. They were renting.
I'll go, then.
For what reason?
There's blood.
And you never had an accident?
So we'll just do nothing?
I'll make the rounds of the neighbors.
And if we're not satisfied, we can take your fears to the sheriff.
Thank you.
[Abigail] Monday, June 23rd.
Dyer said Mrs. Nottoway recalled spotting their caravan on the country road
in the late evening, heading northwest.
[Dyer] Mrs. Nottoway?
[Abigail] She believed she spied Tallie's figure alongside her husband's but was unsure.
A hired hand, she thought, was driving the second wagon.
Sunday, June 29th.
I spotted the sheriff on his way to church.
-Our neighbors, Tallie... -I conveyed my accusations to no response.
Dyer said that no one would investigate a crime
without evidence that a crime had been committed.
Calm myself?
I refused to calm myself, so he tied me to a chair and administered laudanum.
Monday, June 30th.
Bleary and short of breath from the laudanum...
I wake weeping, retire weeping...
stand before my duties weeping.
Sunday, July 6th.
I am a library without books,
a sea of fear, agitation and want.
Dyer speaks of how much we have for which to be grateful.
I sit violently conscious of the ticking clock
while he weeps at what he imagines to be his own poor, forgotten self.
Wednesday, July 9th.
Despite some hours without the laudanum, I was so befogged and wild with grief
that Dyer left me for the afternoon, unsettled and wary of my state.
Tuesday, July 22nd.
Weldon?
-Good day. -The renters at Zebrun's farm are gone.
Did they leave a forwarding address?
No. You've got a letter.
Is it from her?
It is.
Origin?
Onondaga County. Do you know it?
That's north of Syracuse.
You gonna read it?
To myself.
[Tallie] Abigail, Abigail, Abigail.
I'm sorry that all I have to send you is this letter,
and I'm sorry for all that a letter cannot be.
Even the best letter is just a little bit of someone.
I'm sorry I never got to say goodbye.
And I'm sorry that we seem to have traded one sort of misery for another.
It turns out that houses deep in the backwoods
always seem to be awful and unnatural in their loneliness.
If there were only a ruined abbey around here with bats in it,
the view would be perfect.
Our roof is ramshackle and sheds water nicely in dry weather,
but we have to spread milk pans around the floor when it rains.
Still, outside the kitchen,
there are already anemones and heartsease
and even prettier flowers
which my stupidity keeps me from naming for you.
I believe I've enjoyed myself less these last few weeks
than any other female who ever lived.
During what little time I have to myself,
Finney reads aloud instructions for wives from the Old Testament.
But when it comes to the Bible,
I have to say that there are a lot of passages he may know word for word,
but which haven't touched his heart.
I can't account for his state of mind except to say
that my company must be intensely disagreeable to him.
And if that's the case, I'm sorry for it.
[man] Good afternoon!
Afternoon.
Whoa, whoa. Hey.
Got something for you.
There you go.
-Thank you. -Good day.
-Is it for me? -From Schoharie County.
-Your Abigail. -Give that to me.
Give it. Finney, give--
-Finney. -"What's to become
of the thousands of our sex
scattered out in the wilderness and obliged to tax our strengths?
I feel as if, at that selfsame hour, when our prospects were brightest,
that in the dim distance, a black shadow approached.
And yet still, imagine the happiest of unions for us of the sort
in which two families, previously at daggers drawn,
are miraculously brought together on love's account.
It is your face I bear through the night.
It is to you I devote a dreaming space before I turn myself to sleep,
but there is no sleep.
It's as if within me everything clamors for air,
and I think if it's like this now, what will it be like later?
I send you what love and support I can.
I send you all my heart's hopes. Abigail."
[Tallie] Please know that force alone
couldn't have gotten me here to a place like this.
I was told that I had to act in support of interest, happiness
and the reputation of someone I once loved.
As far as I can figure, we're now still only about 85 miles apart.
But of course, people like us don't go on long visits.
[Abigail] Dyer refused first to permit my departure, and then to accompany me...
and only caught up to the cart at the end of our property and climbed aboard.
We were the very picture of anguish, rattling along side by side.
The night was fair and warm with the appearance of a coming rain, a shower.
[Tallie] It's so hard to write about how much I want to thank you,
but I have to start somewhere.
Abigail...
I want to tell you that being with you, even alone,
has been like being a part of the biggest
and most spacious community I could ever imagine.
I feel closer to you than I would to a sister
since everything amazing that I feel...
I chose to feel.
And do you know what memory it is that I most cherish?
It's of your turning to me with that smile you gave me
once you realized that you were loved.
I have no way of knowing what is to come.
But I do know that all of the trust, and care and courage we shared,
that will all shine on us
and protect us.
You are my city of joy.
You are my city of joy.
[Finney] Might I ask your business? [Abigail] I've come to see Tallie. Where is she?
I heard you on the road. You made such a racket, I took you for the tin knocker.
We've ridden for three days. We're not leaving without seeing her.
I'm not concerned with what you will or will not leave without.
-[Dyer] Keep a civil tongue, friend. -Where is she?
I treated her with tea of soot and pine-tree root to good effect.
But sickness always tests our willingness to bow before the greatest authority.
My guess is that it was diphtheria.
No!
[Finney] There is some alienation from marital...
What time is it?
I don't care.
-I have to go. -You're gonna make a mark.
[Dyer] Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
[Abigail] Sunday, August 31st.
Weather very hot and sunny.
I cleaned out the shed, which was full of rusty and dusty rubbish,
washed the windows and preserved apples for the winter.
Fourteen dollars from the sale of our milk and butter.
I have cut my hand with a paring knife.
I console myself with the conviction that someday in the future
when Dyer is forced to travel to Syracuse for feed or supplies,
I will join him, and take his rifle
and go to Skaneateles and kill Finney where he sits.
Dyer has been at work on the barn.
Each day, we enact our separation.
Sometimes after it gets dark,
we walk over the hills across our upper fields for the wide, wide view.
And Dyer tries to imagine us as we were...
while I try to imagine Tallie in that cordial and accepting home
that existed solely in our dreams.
I imagine Tallie and Nellie somewhere together,
and Nellie running her brush through Tallie's hair.
I imagine banishing forever those sentiments of my own
that she chastened and refined.
I imagine resolving to do what I can for Dyer.
And I imagine continuing to write in this ledger,
here, as though this was my life.
As though my life was not elsewhere.
I've always feared that I would bring misfortune to those I loved.
Are you really saying nothing to that?
I don't know where to start.
I can't imagine what more we could do for one another...
with our constraints.
You can't?
I can't.
You can't?
Well, then...
Jeez, there's no service out here.
-What's he messing with? -Beats me.
So?
Fucking hell!
FAMILY ALBUM
Hi, I'm Fran. I'm part of this lovely family from San Miguel, where what matters--
-Move, asshole! -Dad!
Good day, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Servando Manuel Guadalupe Villegas de la Garza.
And this is my family.
You see,
a few years ago, I had to move in with Fran
after I was unfairly kicked out by some bastards
from the retirement home where I lived in perfect harmony.
They kicked you out for hitting the nurse with your cane.
The point is, they kicked me out.
So I ended up living with this group of people
with whom I've gotten along perfectly.
No! It wasn't quite like that.
Well, with whom, after a while, I got along perfectly
and eventually learned to love.
JUST MARRIED
Since then, some have left, and others have come to live with us.
That's how these modern families are.
Oh! And Bill and Memo adopted a kid.
Anyway, that's not why we're here.
You see, Fran and Alma have been fighting
all the fucking time.
What's wrong with you, Dad? You can't say that.
Well, it's the truth.
So, now
we're going to her aunt's house to spend Christmas together.
That's why, this time,
I'll do whatever it takes
to make sure my family has the best Christmas ever, no matter what.
What the fuck now?
Careful.
Here, grab your bag.
There you go.
-Thanks. -Welcome!
-I want to go for a swim. -So do I.
Me too!
Hey! Everybody!
Hold on.
Alma is waiting for us with her aunt.
So we have to make a good first impression.
Ms. Alice is…
Well, she's very kind, but she's also very traditional.
She likes things to go her way.
We're her guests, so please just behave.
Mind your manners, and above all, no foul language, okay?
Wrap it up, asshole. I need to pee.
Family, how was the trip?
-Where's the bathroom? -Hi, Servando. It's back there.
-Honey. -Hi.
Hello, welcome.
I'm so glad to see you!
My boy, as handsome as always.
Aunt, let me introduce my family from San Miguel.
This is Renato. He's in med school and lives with us.
-Nice to meet you. -This is Gala.
She studies permaculture.
-Nice to meet you. -My pleasure.
-Nice to meet you. -My pleasure.
That's Ed. He is retired.
-Nice to meet you. -This is Bill.
He's my dad.
And Memo.
He's my other dad.
And who are you?
I'm Willy!
Nice to meet you, Willy.
And this is…
Servando Manuel Guadalupe Villegas…
de la Garza.
At your service, ma'am.
Alicia Vidaurri. Pleased to meet you, Fernando.
Servando.
Oh, Servando, with an S.
Okay. But Fernando's such a nice name, isn't it?
Weren't there more of you?
Oh, that's too bad.
And René, my son, is at art school in London.
And Gio and Orlando, the musicians, are on tour.
Oh, what a pity I won't get to meet them.
Here we have Cirila and Primitivo.
-Hello. -They can help you with whatever you need.
-A pleasure. -Thanks.
-Thank you. -So, welcome.
Come on! Let me give you the tour.
So here are the pools.
-Pools, as in multiple? -Yes, two.
There are bedrooms over there. Some will sleep over there--
Do you live here alone?
Yes, sweetie.
How boring.
-Willy. -No, he's right.
And that's how you get to the docks.
Isn't it amazing my aunt still has the sailboat?
Amazing!
Thanks for coming.
I know there's been some distance between us lately,
but it's really important for me we--
Fran?
Fran, I met someone else and fell in love.
That's great, honey.
Francisco, you aren't listening!
Sorry, it's--
-The expo. -Yes. I know, the expo.
But we agreed you would disconnect when we were on vacation.
Oh no! What time is it?
Time for couple's therapy!
Fran promised to disconnect from work.
He won't drop his phone.
It was important.
What's the point of you coming if you aren't really here?
You're right. l promise I'll pay more attention to you.
No, not to me, to us.
To us.
Don't even think about it.
That looks delicious.
Look!
-This first. -Corn, cheese, and…
That's it!
Close your mouth, sir. You'll trap a fly.
Everything looks delicious, Alicia.
Thank you, Servando.
All right, let us give thanks.
Thank you, Lord, for our daily bread.
And rice and pork tacos.
And thank you for giving me this time with Alma
and being able to share this lovely time with her and her family.
-Amen. -Amen.
-Enjoy your meal. -I'll want--
Salad first.
I'll also want--
Here's the dressing. I'll take some and pass it.
-Can we pass the salad round? -Want one?
Can't you sleep?
Would you like some tea?
No, thank you, Alicia.
I'll just finish my cigarette and go to bed.
You shouldn't smoke, Servando. It's bad for your health.
At my age, what isn't?
Hey.
I noticed you have a lovely garden.
My son, Fran, is a plant specialist.
No!
Don't you dare touch it!
Good night.
It looks lovely!
What's that?
Oh, Ed.
Oh well, I had to stay.
But you know Fran and Alma need this time together.
Too bad.
-Auntie. -Yes?
Aren't you going to say anything?
What do you mean?
Anything about what?
About my family.
Oh, about them!
Well, what can I say? You were right.
They're all fantastic.
-Aren't they? -Yes.
But your father-in-law's a bit weird.
I knew it! I knew you didn't like him.
No, it's not that.
It's not that I don't like him.
He's just kind of nosy.
Dad, have you seen Alma?
I can never get these things to work.
Let me try, Dad.
Nice place, huh?
Yeah.
And Alicia is nice, isn't she?
What? You don't like her?
Yeah, she's
nice.
But…
-But what? -I don't know.
There's something weird about her.
I'll only ask you one favor, Auntie.
Please, don't go looking for drama.
Behave yourself, Dad.
Don't start trouble for all of us.
Me?
"Me?" I know how much you love drama.
Well, as long as he knows his place.
-Oh, sweetie! -I missed you.
Me too.
I'm a ninja mermaid!
Off to the water, dudes!
No! You can't go in yet.
And it's "ducks."
Yeah, Son!
You can be whatever you want.
Even a ninja mermaid.
Come on, Memo. You can't tell him he can be a ninja mermaid.
Why not? Which book says you can't?
You may be joking,
but Dr. Moonferman clearly states
you can't establish gender concepts at such a young age.
All you'll do is confuse him.
Guillermo!
Yes?
Not you, the boy. Come on, Guillermo.
Who's that guy you said?
Look, sweetie, help me collect this hay to use for the nativity scene.
-Nativity? -Yes, a real live one!
And if you behave, you can be baby Jesus.
-Come on, help me. -Where's the Christmas tree?
No, here at the beach, we don't have Christmas trees.
Then where will Santa leave my presents?
I doubt Santa will bring them here.
Don't cry, sweetie.
What the hell?
-Sweetie, what happened? -Baby, what happened?
Alicia told me
there won't be a Christmas tree
and that Santa won't bring me any presents.
No, it's just a misunderstanding. I didn't say that.
All I said is that Santa probably--
Bill, maybe now is a good time to tell Willy that Santa doesn't exist.
So you're fine with your son being a karate dolphin?
Ninja mermaid.
But not believing in Santa Claus?
What happened?
Her auntie, your son's mom-in-law, or whatever,
told my son there won't be a Christmas tree
and that Santa won't bring him toys.
Plus, my husband wants his son to have a fish tail.
No. It's just that he asked me.
-And-- -What are you talking about?
Of course there'll be a tree.
Of course Santa Claus will come.
And there will be much more.
But I need your help, okay?
I don't want you sitting around while I do everything.
I'm a ninja mermaid!
Kids!
No, hey.
Excuse me, Servando.
Did I hear that right?
Did you just tell them how to celebrate Christmas here,
in my house?
That's right.
Do you have a problem with that?
Yes, actually, I do.
Who gave you the authority to impose your holy will?
My age,
centuries of tradition,
and the fact that in my family, because that is my family,
we do things the right way.
That gives me the right to do whatever I want, ma'am.
And just to be clear,
my will is everything but holy.
I understand, but in this house,
and just to be clear,
this is my house.
Things are done the way I say they should be done.
Understood?
Ooh! First warning--
It was nice talking to you.
I think I'm hungry.
I think I love you.
-What? -What?
-What did you say? No! -I mean…
Don't say it!
Fuck!
If you're asking, the truth is--
It doesn’t matter. We're friends. No, we're family!
We aren't family.
We met six months ago.
It doesn't matter. We all live in the same house.
And you know how it works. We're all family.
Damn Greek tragedy.
-Gala? -Yeah?
It's me. Wanna go to the beach?
Yeah, coming. I'm just getting my swimsuit.
Get dressed.
Gala, look me in the eye and tell me you don't feel anything.
No. Hush! Get dressed.
MOTHER BELUGA
Oh my! Primitivo, you startled me!
One of these days, you'll kill me!
You must forgive me, ma'am,
but Mr. Servando said we're ready, and we can start now.
Start what?
He only said that we're ready, and we can start now.
Fine. Let's go.
Go on.
Everyone will take a piece of paper.
It has the name of the person you'll give a gift to on Christmas Eve.
And don't tell anyone who it is. It's a surprise.
I don't want Gala.
I don't want you either.
It's a surprise.
I don't want to switch. Thanks.
Hey, what are you all doing?
Just waiting for you to draw names for the gift exchange.
Oh, no, thanks.
We'd rather not take part in your traditions.
Well, it's your loss.
You were going to get a gift.
There's no better gift than good company
and a sincere wish.
Tell Willy he'll have to play with good company and a sincere wish.
-Enough, Dad. -Relax, everything's fine.
We can discuss this tonight. Save your breath.
What's going on tonight?
Welcome to discussion night, Christmas on the beach edition!
Alicia is here so, please,
be civilized, take turns speaking, one at a time.
Who wants to start?
-I'd like to say-- -I want to start.
I don't get it. Memo is telling him Santa doesn't exist…
Memo knows best…
-It's fine if he… -Hey!
If the kid is already confused, he'll be even more confused, right?
Hey!
Alicia hates Christmas and wants to fuck it up for all of us.
Excuse me. That is not the case, sir.
I don't want to ruin anyone's Christmas.
-You don't? -No.
Then why did you tell Willy that Santa Claus doesn't exist?
Wait, I didn't say that.
That was a misunderstanding.
What I said, and I repeat, sir,
is I won't allow you to come into my house, give orders,
and tell me how to do things.
Listen, calm down, everyone.
Why don't we all say what we want for Christmas
and come to an agreement?
We can work this out.
All right.
Okay, let's do this.
Shall we start?
Fran, I don't know what you want for Christmas, but please drop the phone.
Okay. Let's change the subject.
I want codfish and romeritos for dinner.
Codfish?
-Codfish is too salty. -Yes, it's traditional--
Turkey!
-Stuffed turkey? -What kind of pizza?
Willy loves veggies.
-Auntie? -Romeritos and codfish.
-I've never had that. -Rice and maybe turkey.
-Should we have a Christmas pageant? -Yes!
Tree or no tree?
-Yes. -Christmas tree?
-I don't. -By majority vote.
-Yes, but a live tree. -No synthetic trees. They're garbage.
-It should be a plastic tree. -Plastic? Really?
-Yes! -Not natural.
-We'll do a nativity scene. -Of course.
-Willy will be baby Jesus. -How cute!
And Servando will be the donkey.
Doing a nativity scene is ridiculous.
We aren't in Bethlehem.
Do you see any camels on the beach?
Right.
It makes more sense for some old fat guy
to fly a sleigh pulled by reindeer from the North Pole
to fly a sleigh pulled by reindeer from the North Pole and climb down chimneys
and climb down chimneys to leave cookies and presents.
Everyone calm down.
So we are having a Christmas pageant.
Of course we are.
It's important.
Aunt Alicia, Primitivo, and Cirila will take part in the gift exchange.
-Okay? -Hey, wait.
Everything sounds great,
but you left out Santa Claus.
Because the lady of the house doesn’t want him to come.
No.
You'll have to forgive me,
but the bearded fat man is coming.
I won't back down on that.
Well, look at that, neither will I.
Then let's wait and see what happens.
Do whatever you have to do,
and I'll do what I have to do.
-I want another one. -Okay.
Make it two.
Are you sure?
-Aren't there eggs? -Right here.
More syrup.
-Here, have a strawberry, okay? -Why a strawberry?
Wow, Willy! You have a good appetite.
I'd say the same about you, love.
Dad, what happened to you?
The mosquitoes ganged up on me.
Did you leave the mosquito screen open?
It was you!
Calm down. Don't blame her for the mosquitoes.
She'll pay for this.
She even took the sheets off the bed.
Calm down, Dad. Think about it.
Do you think someone like Alicia, who has treated us so nicely,
would sneak into your room just to open your mosquito screen?
Hell yeah! I would. Why wouldn't she?
Okay, enough…
But I won't leave it at that.
Round two.
OFF
Hush. Come here.
Miss?
Why are you so mean to Servando?
I'm not mean.
But I won't let him boss me around in my own home.
I won't allow it.
Do you really hate Santa and all those traditions?
Of course not.
I'm not crazy. Actually, I love them.
But Servando won't come here and do as he pleases.
Alma…
Alma!
-Are you okay? -Yeah. Great.
It's a lovely view, isn't it, honey?
Yes, Auntie, lovely.
I can't find the thingy for this.
What's up?
Are you okay?
It got canceled.
-What got canceled? -John Maine.
The main artist for the expo, he pulled out.
Two months.
We negotiated with him for two months.
And a week before the event, he cancels, and it's over.
Plus, Alma is mad at me.
She says I'm always working and stuff.
She's right.
Well, now you'll have more time to spend with your wife.
Well, yes.
But don't tell Alma the expo was canceled.
If she thinks it's still on and I'm prioritizing her,
I can at least get some points.
It's difficult with women because
it's bad if you pay them attention, bad if you don't.
I can't figure them out.
You can't either, much less Servando.
What do women want?
-To screw us over. -Love.
Really. That's what they want.
To love and be loved,
just like us and everyone else.
-For fuck's sake! -Yeah, that's right.
-Get real, man! -He falls in love easily.
Can't you see?
I'm racking up points now.
What's all this?
Who are you waiting for?
The most beautiful woman in the world.
What did you do?
Excuse me?
I know you. Tell me what you did.
I can't believe it.
I really can't.
Can't I do something nice for my wife?
Can't I want to be alone with you, on the beach?
And enjoy the here and now?
I'm offended.
Offended, I tell you.
Okay, fine, I'm sorry.
It's just that
you took me by surprise.
Thanks, love.
Dirty old man.
What did he say?
I think he said some Gina lady is dying.
And I don't think she'll make it.
To the right, up.
No, the other right.
This way. That's better! Up there.
I also got confused.
-Hey. -Yes?
Could you bring me one of the sacks behind the fence?
-Of course. -Thanks.
I don't get it. I hate Christmas.
-Relax. -What?
Renato!
Renato!
Can you come help me move the bed?
Coming!
What's up?
Hey, you.
You're all sweaty.
I was carrying stuff.
-Where do you want the bed? -Come here.
Hey! No, I'm not your toy.
Of course you are. You're my boy toy.
Sorry, Gala, but no.
What are we?
For fuck's sake, Renato!
Why are you so hung up? Why label everything?
-Because I like you. -Come on, man.
And you don't like me.
-So-- -What?
This is how it is?
This is how it is.
-This is how it is? -That's right.
Really, this is how it is?
This is how it is, Gala.
What are you doing here?
You scared the hell out of me.
You scared me too.
Can I help you with anything?
Ms. Alicia doesn’t like anyone touching her garden tools without permission.
Oh really?
Yep.
Hey, Gala, give me your eights.
-Which one you want? -Red.
Ready? Dinner time!
Chow time!
-Good, I'm starving. -Me too. Where's your father-in-law?
Alicia, you decide when it's time for dinner.
Fine, it's his loss.
Family!
What's going on?
Come!
What's my dad up to? Come on.
Let's go.
Weren't they going to have dinner?
It's a miracle! A Christmas miracle!
-What now, Dad? -Wow!
You're gonna love it, especially you, Willy.
Let's see.
Now we can have a real Christmas.
You're gonna love it.
My tree.
-Ta-da! -Wow!
How about that?
-Nice! -My tree.
It isn't pine, it isn't dead,
and it isn't synthetic.
My tree!
What's wrong, Auntie?
You don't like it?
What's wrong, Auntie? Are you okay?
-Let's take her to her room. -Let's go.
Careful.
She planted that tree with her sister.
Goddammit!
Careful.
-Need anything else? -Should we call a doctor?
No, just leave.
All I want is to rest.
Let us know if you need anything, okay?
Alicia?
Alicia, are you awake?
Alicia?
Alicia?
What are you doing here?
Oh, Alicia.
I was looking for you.
-I wanted to ask you-- -Get out of here!
But--
I said get out!
I'm sorry.
Out! Get out!
Just look at this.
Alicia!
Alicia!
By any chance, did you untie your boat?
Because either the beach is moving away from us
or us from the beach.
Oh my God. What did you do?
What? I didn't do anything!
Do you have a phone to call the kids?
Or some emergency flares?
-Like in the movies. -No, I don't!
Are you just going to sit there, breathing in and out?
I thought you knew how to sail this boat.
It isn't a boat. It's a sailboat.
Same difference.
Why don't you get us back to shore?
Because it's a sailboat, and there's no wind.
It would've been easy enough to add a motor or something.
Well, it does have a motor, but it's broken!
And please be quiet, for God's sake! Just be quiet! Crazy old man.
My goodness!
Hey, leave that alone.
Are you deaf? I told you to leave that alone.
Relax already.
We're going to be here for a while.
Oh, no. Please don't smoke here.
It's for your own good.
Don't you value your own life?
Alicia,
at my age, I'm more likely
to be hit by lightning than to die from smoking.
It's a ticking bomb.
Life…
starts slowly.
As if…
as if it will never end.
Then everything speeds up,
and it seems like there isn't enough time.
And suddenly,
one day, out of the blue,
in a split second…
Boom.
I have an aneurysm, Servando.
So, that explains the breathing.
It helps me calm down.
Homero said--
Homer, the Greek philosopher?
Homero, the Mexican pothead.
Homero said
that fear of death is worse than dying.
And the fear of living is worse than the fear of dying.
Hey, have you seen my dad? I can't find him.
Alma!
Come here, please!
Should I call the Coast Guard?
Or should we leave them out there?
Hey, can I ask you something?
So,
why are you so stubborn about Christmas?
It's just that
many years ago, when Fran and his siblings were young,
we'd celebrate every Christmas together.
At home.
And Fran's mom always cooked the same thing.
Turkey stuffed with plums.
It was awful.
And I'd dress up as Santa Claus.
I'd come in and give everyone presents.
That's so sweet. So sweet.
I hated it so much.
Yeah, I hated dressing up.
I hated everything about Christmas.
But my wife made me do it.
And when she died,
I realized
that what I thought I hated
were the best moments of my life.
But my children were no longer little kids.
And you could say
I wasn't the best father.
There!
And now that I'm old,
I want to relive those moments.
But why now?
Well, because at my age,
any day could be my last day.
Any Christmas
could be my last.
And now I'd like to feel that again.
That peace.
That love.
It's stiff.
What?
My heart stopped, Alicia.
Oh! You're an incorrigible romantic, Servando.
For real.
For real?
It's for real! Help!
-Dad! -Servando!
Dad!
Servando!
You'll be fine, Dad. Don't worry.
Easy. Remember Memo's yoga lessons.
He'll be okay, won't he?
Of course he will. You'll see.
God…
Servando Villegas's relatives?
He's my dad.
I have the results.
He had a bad panic attack.
Apparently caused by strong emotions or stress.
Oh, I see.
Right.
I'd like to keep him overnight for observation.
Okay
But don't worry, he's fine.
Can we see him?
Yes. Go ahead.
-Who is it? -It's me, Dad.
How are you feeling?
Shitty, but…
I could be worse, right?
The doctor wants to keep you in overnight.
They want to make sure you're all right.
You gave us a scare, Dad.
Fuck, I thought I was a goner.
It was just a panic attack.
Of course I was panicked.
Being with a woman
after who knows how long.
I need a drink. Can I get you anything?
A whiskey.
I'll be right back.
How are you, Dad?
I can't stop thinking about your mom.
It isn't any of your business, but…
I hadn't been with anyone since she left.
I'm sure that's why I had the panic attack.
For sure.
Wow! What a story.
I'd love to, but I can't.
In fact, it's urgent I speak to Fran.
Hi, Gina. I've been busy.
What's up?
What?
Okay, got to go.
And you're leaving me here with this idiot?
Hey, sir!
I'll be back for you tomorrow, okay?
Don't do anything stupid, Francisco.
These opportunities only come around once in a lifetime.
Alma will understand, I swear.
Drive safely.
Now you can get me that whiskey.
Right, after you called me an idiot?
I don't get it.
I really don't know what happened, but we're good again.
That's great, isn't it?
When you met Fran, did you know he was the one right away?
Honestly, no.
I mean,
I liked him. He was really nice.
But, no, at first, we were friends.
Interesting.
I'll be right back.
Ed, do you still want to switch names?
Come on.
May I?
Come in, sweetie.
How are you doing, Auntie?
I'm calmer now.
I'm glad it was just a scare.
Auntie,
what's up with you and Servando?
What?
It's fine. It isn't a bad thing.
Nothing.
If that was the case--
I can't.
Why not?
Because of the aneurysm?
Are you going to keep using that excuse to be alone?
I can't be in a relationship.
I could die any minute.
Yeah, you could. I could. Any of us could die any minute.
So what?
You won't give yourself the chance to be with anyone?
Give it a chance. Give yourself a chance.
Fran, what's up?
I could've brought you clothes at the hospital.
Oh, no, well…
Remember John Maine, the artist who was going to inaugurate the expo?
-He canceled last week. -What?
But guess who I'm about to get to replace him.
Dan Belmondo!
The Dan Belmondo, in our gallery. Can you believe it?
Fran, I have to tell you something.
We're in luck. Really. This is amazing.
But this is important.
This will cover René's school. I'm sure of it, Alma.
How mad would you be if I go to San Miguel tomorrow?
Now I get it.
All this time you've been romantic was because your artist canceled.
Of course not.
We'll have dinner. I'll drive to San Miguel first thing in the morning.
It would be two or three days, tops.
I'll be back for New Year's, I promise.
I hope.
That's a seven on the angry scale, huh?
It's a nine.
And that's a ten.
"To Willy, from…"
Willy!
What are you up to?
You're spying on the presents, Willy! I saw you!
Cirila!
Primitivo!
Yes, ma'am?
Please hide the presents so no one can find them.
You know kids.
-No need to worry, ma'am. -Oh, Cirila!
EMERGENCY WARD
Where's Francisco?
He said he'd come.
I don't understand.
How can you have an inauguration on 25th December?
Christmas is tourist season at San Miguel. You know that, Alma.
I can't believe you don't value the effort and sacrifice I'm making--
Sacrifice?
It's a sacrifice to spend time with me and your family at Christmas?
I didn't say that.
You don't listen, Fran.
I've been trying to tell you something important.
Alma, I love you.
I do. But I'm going to the expo tomorrow.
If your mind's made up, why not leave now?
Alma--
Okay.
We're here!
I'm glad you're here!
Hi, Alicia.
The hospital did you good.
You look much better.
Thank you.
Well, I'll check if anyone needs anything. Excuse me.
Yeah, I'll also go see if…
I guess I'll also go see if…
Alicia,
I want to talk to you.
Please forgive me
if…
I went too far.
I shouldn't have.
I hope we can forget what happened. I beg you.
I thought you said being afraid to live was worse
than being afraid to die.
I know.
But I can't.
I wish I had never met you.
Where are you going?
To San Miguel.
Dammit, Francisco! I told you not to do anything stupid.
I'll be back for you in a few days.
I'm coming with you.
What? But you have your Christmas dinner with everyone.
It wasn't a question.
I've no business being here.
I should leave out of respect for Alicia.
Then hurry up. Let's go.
What? They took the bus?
And that's not all.
Unbelievable!
Father of the year, I'd say. I bet it was Servando's idea.
Where did they go?
To San Miguel.
-Alma! -Let her be.
She needs her space.
Yeah, but the point was to be together.
What I've learned in life is that if you lose a tooth,
your smile will be ruined.
How poetic.
Does this mean there won't be any Christmas?
Of course there will!
Yeah!
-Are you really going to eat that? -I'd rather be eating with the family.
No. No, don't.
No?
Fifteen pesos.
There are rosemary burritos if you want.
Just kidding, Dad. Let's go.
You look great!
What a lovely picture!
Hey.
-Who are you supposed to be? -I don't know. A wise man, I guess. You?
Balthazar, right?
Wasn't Alma going to be Mary?
Yes, but she isn't feeling well.
So now Gala is the Virgin.
Okay, pose for the photo.
Hey, kids, what's wrong?
Why the long faces?
With all due respect, ma'am,
this is all wrong.
Yeah. He's right.
Willy is going to get heatstroke.
Well, we won't do it if you don't want to.
You know what? Since no one brought me presents,
being ninja Jesus sucks.
Let me know when dinner's ready.
Fucking kid.
Hey.
Honey…
HOMERO - "THE PATHS OF LIFE"
When are we going to have dinner?
If you eat it without thinking, it'll taste better.
This is the crappiest Christmas dinner I've ever had.
I remember a much crappier Christmas dinner.
The year after Mom died.
Don't you remember?
You cooked.
It was my first time.
You charred the turkey.
I had to carve it with a hammer.
Not even Solovino ate it, huh?
Not for the lack of trying.
I think the apple pie was worse though.
The pie was so fucking disgusting.
I can't believe I mixed up the salt and the sugar.
But I still ate it so you wouldn't feel so bad.
Know what the best part of that Christmas was?
The peanuts?
No.
Being together as a family.
It isn't that bad.
What if…
Yes, Son…
Right, Dad?
Let's go back.
Okay, we'll go back, Dad.
Fucking hell!
Dad, hand me the tools. They're back there.
Francisco!
What is it, Dad?
Come here!
No.
We have to get back somehow.
Please.
Who thought to hide the presents there?
How should I know?
Here comes another one.
Please.
Sir! Hey, please! Over here!
Dammit!
Will no one give two guys a ride on Christmas Eve?
No, Dad. Times have changed.
Please!
Perfect.
It's fruit cake.
Good.
Looks delicious.
There, sweetie, please.
Put the rosemary potatoes over here.
I can put it here, honey.
Wherever you want.
The romeritos over there.
Can you move this a little? That's it.
Perfect.
Okay now.
Let's give thanks.
Thank you, Lord, for our daily bread--
And the cod and romeritos.
And--
I can't. I just can't. I'm sorry.
I don't feel well. I can't do this.
I can't.
May I say some words?
So, tonight we give thanks
for the opportunity to be here,
all of us together.
And also for enjoying this delicious meal.
And although, since you arrived, there have been some difficulties,
it's also true
you brought new life,
full of light and joy,
to this house.
Muchos thank-yous.
I would also like to thank you, ma'am,
for making Cirila and I part of your family.
Thank you.
And I would like to thank you.
All of you.
Though unwittingly,
you taught us it doesn't matter how you celebrate Christmas,
it doesn't matter if there's turkey or romeritos,
or if there's all kinds of things or nothing at all.
In the end, all that matters is that we're together,
celebrating with the people we love.
And tonight,
I give thanks for that.
So… enjoy!
Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas.
Look! Here comes another one, Francisco.
Forget about it, Dad. Don't waste your time. No one's stopping.
Christmas has been canceled for us.
-Are you heading for the beach? -Yeah.
Get in. I'll take you!
-Thank you. -Thanks.
There you go!
Ready?
Hurry up, Francisco!
Coming, Dad.
Let's go!
I shouldn't have told him to leave.
Not at Christmas.
I only wish he was here.
Oh, honey.
Fran!
Surprise!
Gina! How nice to see you.
I'm happy to see you too. Where's Ed?
Over there. Come in.
Ed! Where are you, honey? I'm here!
-Merry Christmas! -Gina!
-Gina, what a surprise! -Welcome!
Gina, we missed you.
I couldn't miss this Christmas.
It's all taken care of.
This is more important.
I'm sure Fran will understand. Right, Fran?
Where's Fran?
-I think I went too far. -Go at your own pace.
The last class, you did well.
That kid, I swear.
I shouldn't have told him to leave.
At least not before telling him I'm pregnant.
What?
-You're pregnant? -What?
What?
She's pregnant!
You're pregnant?
Oh, sweetie!
What a happy Christmas!
Hey! I'll be godmother.
-Obviously. -Congratulations, honey, what a blessing!
Congrats! I can't believe it!
Neither can I!
Finally, someone who will understand me.
Sweetie, we understand you.
Even if it doesn’t seem like it sometimes.
And I want you to know that you can believe whatever you want.
You can always be whatever you want, okay?
Yeah!
-I'll get it! -Fran!
Balthazar?
-Huh? -Hey!
-Hi. -Gio!
Hello!
-Merry Christmas! -Hi, Merry Christmas!
What a surprise! I can't believe it!
Our concert was canceled. So here we are.
-That's great! Come in. -We thought we'd surprise you. Hi!
Ms. Gio!
-Gio! -Hey! How are you?
This is my aunt Alicia. This is Gio and Orlando.
Hi, nice to meet you. Welcome.
Thank you.
Where's Fran?
And Servando?
Take the blanket. I barely use it.
Thanks!
Watch your step, Dad. That's it.
Thanks for everything. You saved Christmas.
Hey!
So you can always find the way back.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas.
I have an idea.
-Dad, these are the Christmas decorations. -Who's there?
Holy cow!
Fuck! What's wrong with you?
You always show up like a ghost.
You scared me too. I do have feelings.
Sometimes people come in and steal the tools.
Ms. Alicia ends up blaming me.
How can I help you?
Now that you mention it…
What?
You're going to have a baby?
Oh, can I be the godmother?
Nope, too late.
Much too late.
-I'm going to be an uncle. -I'm going to be an aunt.
Hey, Willy.
What did you ask for from baby Jesus and Santa Claus for Christmas?
Nothing for me.
Just for the whole family to be together for Christmas.
-Oh, how sweet! -My child! You're so sweet!
It's snowing!
It doesn't snow at the bea--
It's snowing on the beach!
Come see! There's snow! It's snowing!
What's this?
No, it can't be.
Come on, hurry!
-It's amazing! -Snow!
-Oh! -Primitivo!
I'll get you for this!
Can you hear that?
Hey.
Can you help me move the bed now?
Yeah.
Hey, family!
Is there room for these two not-so-holy pilgrims?
Presents!
Thank God you're back! Fran!
-Gina! -Servando!
Gio! Orlando! What are you doing here?
Christmas is always better with family!
I'm glad you came back with the presents, Servando.
Thank you.
I didn't just come back because of the presents, Alicia.
You didn't?
No.
I realized there is still so much to experience
and share.
Without fear.
Without fear.
Alma.
I'm sorry.
No gallery, no artist, nothing is more important than you.
Forgive me.
Hey, Fran, can you name your baby William?
Willy, Fran doesn’t know yet.
Sorry for not telling you sooner.
I didn't want you to find out this way.
Wait…
I'm going to be a dad?
Yes.
-I'm going to be a dad? -Yes.
I'm going to be a dad! I'm gonna be a dad!
I'm going to be a grandpa!
-I'll be a great-aunt. -A grandpa!
-Party! -I'm gonna be a dad!
Hooray!
Party!
-Oh no! Not again! -No, wait.
Relax.
They'll be fine.
He took his Viagra and everything.
[woman 2] I was with Kut, a pimp.
He said that I needed to get some money.
[man] This defendant shot Johnny Allen in the head, in his bed,
but gives a wild theory of how it was self-defense.
I shot him because I thought he was gonna shoot me.
We, the jury, find the defendant, Cyntoia Denise Brown,
guilty, first-degree murder.
[woman 1] If you are a juvenile and you're convicted in Tennessee of first-degree murder,
the only two options are either true life without parole or 51 years.
Hey, Mommy.
Well, I got life.
[woman 3] Outside of the glass and the bars,
we may never be like a mother and a daughter should be.
Here's a kid who didn't have a chance.
She didn't have a chance before she was born...
[woman 4] I got pregnant on my 16th birthday.
I drank, and I was introduced to crack cocaine.
My mother, we didn't live in a very stable home.
It came from genetics, and the genetics should stop.
Cyntoia Brown, in prison for more than a decade now,
her case is catching fire on social media.
[man 2] Cyntoia made the decision to seek the help of the governor
and petition for clemency.
[man 3] In 2004, she was considered a prostitute.
Today, she would be considered a victim of sexual predators.
She has made the most amazing transformation.
[Cyntoia] I have come such a long way.
It's been a very long time.
When I was 16, I did a horrible thing,
and I have carried that with me this whole time.
I know that your decision is very serious.
I do pray that you show me mercy and that you give me a second chance.
My name is Cyntoia Denise Brown.
I'm 16 years old.
We are in Nashville, Tennessee
at the Davidson County Juvenile Detention Center.
I was charged with homicide and robbery
and possession of a weapon and criminal impersonation.
Most of my life, I've been feeling how everybody else wants me to feel
and saying what everybody else wants me to say.
That's because I was so wanting to be loved
because I really just never felt like anybody loved me.
I wasn't happy at home. I was stressed out all the time.
It just kind of wears you out and tires you out, ages you, makes you grow.
Old... tired, weary.
That's how I feel.
I just keep setting myself up for failure.
I fall every time, and each time I fall harder.
And I'd say this has been my hardest fall. [laughs]
[woman] Cyntoia is charged with criminal homicide, especially aggravated robbery,
a handgun possession, and criminal impersonation.
The most serious of those being the criminal homicide charge.
She's charged with an offense that happened on the night of August 6th,
and she's been in here, in the Juvenile Justice Center,
since August 8th when she was arrested by police on the charge.
The state has announced an intent to attempt to transfer her
to the adult system to treat her as any other adult charged with homicide.
[Sinback] In Tennessee, juveniles can be transferred on any charge if they're 16 or older.
Cyntoia is right there on the dividing line.
We've had people in Tennessee as young as 12 years old before
transferred on homicide charges.
My job is to show the judge that Cyntoia is worth saving.
In juvenile court, she would receive the services that she needs
that will be identified by the doctors, I hope, after her psychological testing.
That's where Dr. Bernet and Dr. Walker really come in.
They can identify what the problems are with Cyntoia,
why she's acting the way she is and whether those problems can be treated.
[Bernet] Cyntoia has been seen by several different psychologists
and different people conducting evaluations.
She's in even more trouble than anybody really ever imagined.
Cyntoia, did somebody explain to you why I'm meeting with you today,
why we're having this evaluation?
[Cyntoia] Because of what I did.
Yeah.
You know, the purpose of doing this evaluation,
it might be able to help you when you go to court.
I want to get straight...
who's in your family. You have sort of a complicated family.
Yeah, my mom, Ellenette Brown.
-[Bernet] What kind of work does she do? -She's a teacher.
Gina, is this your biological mother?
Yeah.
-Gina as in Gina-- -Georgina Mitchell.
-How old is she, do you think? -She's probably 32.
Yeah, do you know how to tell?
[Cyntoia] Because she had me when she was about 16. I'm 16.
Right. That's right.
Does that seem sort of funny to you that your mom was 16 and now you're 16?
-Does that-- -[Cyntoia] I guess. I don't know.
-Does that seem sort of strange? -[Cyntoia] No.
[Bernet] Do you know anything about your dad?
-[Bernet] Some people have mood swings. -Mm-hmm.
[Bernet] Have you ever had that happen to you? Do you know what a mood swing is?
-Yeah, I have them all the time. -[Bernet] Yeah.
Can you tell me about them? What happens when you have a mood swing?
[Cyntoia] One minute, I'll be happy, and then I'll be depressed and sad and gloomy.
And then I'll be mad, and then I'll be back happy.
And then I'll be just kind of depressed...
and different type of stuff like that.
[Bernet] These times when you get real depressed and you cry nonstop,
how long does that typically last?
Does it last a day or week or two, three weeks?
Anywhere from a day to hours to weeks.
The longest was for like a week and a half I cried.
What happens when you get real happy?
That's very often-- I mean, very rare that I get just real happy.
If I'm talking to someone and having a good conversation, I'll be happy.
[Bernet] What about times you get real, real angry?
When I'm locked up.
I don't like people telling me do this, do that,
you need to do it this way, not the other way,
and you need to be like this,
you shouldn't think like this. I don't like it.
you shouldn't think like this. I don't like it. It fucking drives me nuts, and I can't stand it.
Well...
I got a lot of information here, and I'm gonna have to talk to Dr. Walker.
And then I'm gonna talk to Kathy Evans,
and then we're going to try to do something that might help you out
when you go to court.
Do you think you can?
Cyntoia, this first thing I'd like you to do is kind of a test of your imagination.
I'm going to show you some pictures, some cards with pictures on them.
I want you to make up a story about each picture.
Please tell me what's happening in the picture,
Please tell me what's happening in the picture, what led up to the scene and how the story ends.
Tell me what the people are talking about and what they're feeling.
Use your imagination and remember there are no right or wrong answers, okay?
-Tell me a story about this one. -Oh, shit.
I think she killed the little girl.
-[Walker] Say again. -She killed the little girl
because I see some blood or something right here, and now she's feeling bad.
She's just realizing what she's done.
Tell me a story about this one.
[Cyntoia] Well, I think they just got to arguing.
And she really doesn't want him to kiss her,
but he's forcing her.
This slut is telling her to give her the money.
This bitch is sitting back enjoying it. I hate people like that, swear to God.
And they're doing it because she's black.
She probably was friends with these two girls.
They just used her so they could get what they wanted out of her.
[Bernet] Did you talk to Dr. Walker this morning? [Sinback] I have not talked to him yet.
He's drafted up some results here,
but basically, the testing is totally consistent.
On the testing, she was honest, and so in other words, it appeared to be valid.
The Roberts Apperception Test is the one where you show
the pictures of the situations, and the person makes up stories.
He said it was very striking. All her stories were chaotic,
and none of them had a resolution.
They were all violence, aggression,
an unusual degree of negative emotion, anger, rejection.
I mean, this is her view of the world.
How did this manifest itself when this guy Johnny was killed?
See, I think that some of these characteristics affected the behaviors.
Her affect of instability, in other words, becoming suddenly frightened
about the situation she was in and her paranoia.
Now, what can we do with all this?
She's 16-and-a-half.
She is.
So if she were to stay in the juvenile court,
she would be under the control of the juvenile court until she's 19.
I think that would be long enough to help her get her situation under control.
She has a serious personality disorder which requires therapy
in a good, wholesome residential program.
Tomorrow, we're gonna be going to court,
but today, we're gonna have an opportunity to talk with her biological mother.
So that's kind of-- That's a little bit unusual.
Cyntoia was given up for adoption about 14 years ago,
and her biological mother had not seen her in all that time.
It would be helpful to know whether there's any kind of mental disorder
among the biological family of Cyntoia.
It's really good to see you before the hearing
because there are a few things that I wanted to find out or ask both of you about.
And I guess I'm kind of glad that you all could say hi to each other.
I guess you haven't really seen each other for a long time.
It's been a long time. Yes, it has.
-[Burnet] Yeah. -Fourteen-and-a-half years.
Ms. Mitchell, I'll tell you what I would find helpful
is how things went yesterday when you saw Cyntoia. How'd that go?
I was real excited and real happy. And I had been waiting a long time.
And I was just so glad to see her.
I know Ellenette has provided for her, and I thank her for that.
I’m glad you met. Was it like-- How long did y'all--
[Mitchell] Oh, for a long time.
Um, I could see, you know, the traits she has.
It was like looking at me at that same age.
The ups and downs, anger one minute, happy the next.
You know, she wanted to know about our side of the family and...
Let me just ask you about some family history stuff
because, you know, sometimes, when people have some sort of mental problem,
sometimes it runs in families because of genetic things.
[Mitchell] My mom shot herself. She sent me next door
when I was in second grade,
and she shot herself in the stomach.
My mom and her mom, both of them, they're drunks, suicidal.
She took a shotgun and blowed her chest away, killed herself.
Your mom had a biological brother
who had some problems as well, mental health problems?
I know about these, yeah. Um, all of them do.
And see, that's why I left, because...
I prayed to God that--
I didn't wanna be like her. I didn't wanna be like none of 'em.
[Burnet] Right.
Can you tell me what she was like then? What kind of baby was she?
[Mitchell] Oh, she was a good baby.
She was real good.
It just got really hard, and I felt like I just... You know, I couldn't do it alone.
-Eighteen months. -We had her off and on
since she was six months old.
[Burnet] What happened after that? I guess when she got in high school,
-or junior high, there were more serious-- -[Brown] Well, yes.
When it started was, she had gotten herself
kicked out of regular school into alternative school.
That was the first time she had initially run away
because she was afraid to come home.
And she was gone for, I think, maybe a few days.
And she had someone to call me.
Mm-hmm. [Brown] I said, "Well, you know, that only lasts for a little while,
but your place is here at home. You have to go to school.
You can't, at 12 years old--
There's no way in the world you could take care of yourself."
So, of course she agreed, you know, and she came home.
And then from that point on, it was just like every day,
every other day, every month, every other month,
it was just something, just something constantly. Constantly.
-Meaning more and more behavior problems? -[Brown] More and more.
It's like the behavior problems,
that wasn't even the tip of the iceberg,
because after that, she'd gone back to alternative school
and then left school again, and the police called me.
[Brown] I think Cyntoia had just pretty well, at that point, made up her mind.
-I think it was too structured... -[Bernet] Right. ...for her, you know?
And toward the end, she didn't want to be at home.
She had said to me that, "I knew I couldn't smoke, I couldn't drink."
She said, "And I knew I couldn't get high because you wouldn't allow that."
I felt that this is what I had to do for me. [Bernet] Mm-hmm.
Basically, the conversation that we just had here today,
that's the exact conversation I want to have in court.
If you guys could try to be as conversational as possible with the judge.
I think that you--
I'm past it, you know. I mean...
-[Sinback] I'm very proud of you guys. -My past is my past, you know, and...
-[Sinback] Mm-hmm. -You know, I've moved on, you know, and...
Like I said, I appreciate, you know, what she's done for Toia.
I'm sorry that, you know, she had to go through that with Toia, -the way Toia ended up. -Mm-hmm.
-But you know... -[Bernet and Sinback] Yeah. ...my life wasn't easy either. And you know, it's a trait thing, I guess. [Sinback] Mm-hmm.
[Burnet] The issue in juvenile court is whether Cyntoia should remain in juvenile court
or whether she should be transferred to criminal court.
If she stays in juvenile court, then she'll undoubtedly go
to some sort of juvenile detention facility until she's 19.
If she is transferred to adult court,
the only sentence that first-degree murder carries is life in prison.
It's going to be an uphill battle.
Not only do I have to show
that Cyntoia has identifiable mental health problems
and circumstances that can be corrected.
But I also have to show that it's worth doing that
in a case where a gentleman has been killed.
[Green] All right.
We are here this afternoon, I believe, in the matter of Cyntoia Brown.
It's my understanding this is set as a transfer hearing. Is that correct?
-[Sinback] Yes, Your Honor. -[Brown] So are we ready to proceed?
-[man] Yes, ma'am. -[Sinback] Yes, ma'am.
-[Green] You are Cyntoia Brown? -[Cyntoia] Yes, ma'am.
[Green] I have your date of birth listed as January the 29th, 1988.
-Is that correct? -Yes, ma'am.
-[Green] That makes you, what, 15? -Sixteen.
[Green] Sixteen. Do you understand why you're here?
-Yes, ma'am. -[Green] All right.
This is not a hearing to determine
if you're guilty or innocent of the charges against you.
The only purpose of today's hearing
is to determine where your case should be tried.
Whether it should be heard here in the juvenile court,
or if your case should be transferred to the criminal courts
and you should be tried there.
[Sinback] I want you to start with the night of August 6th of 2004.
Where did you begin that evening around seven o'clock?
[Cyntoia] I was in the hotel room.
-[Sinback] Okay, and who were you with? -Kut, Garion.
[Sinback] And who is Kut?
[Cyntoia] Kut was someone that I was dating,
but he kind of turned into, like, what other people would look at as a pimp.
[Sinback] Do you look at it as a pimp?
During the time, no.
Changes were happening so fast, I didn't.
[Sinback] What about now?
Yes, now that I look on the situation, I do.
[Sinback] What were you doing with Kut in the motel room at the Intown Suites?
[Cyntoia] We were either getting high or having sex. That's all we ever did.
[Sinback] What did he say to you that evening?
He said that I was slipping and that I was starting to become a slouch,
that I needed to get out and get on my grind and get some money.
When I left, I was looking for a ride so I could go out to East Nashville.
[Sinback] Who were you going to see in East Nashville?
[Cyntoia] I wasn't going to see particularly anyone.
I was going to an area that I knew was-- A lot of people go there and prostitute.
[Sinback] Where did you walk to?
[Cyntoia] I made it to the Sonic before someone asked me if I needed a ride.
[Sinback] Okay. When you walked up to the Sonic, who approached you?
[Cyntoia] A man in a white truck.
[Sinback] Is this the person that has been referred to throughout this hearing?
-Mr. Allen, the deceased? -[Cyntoia] Yes, ma'am.
[Sinback] What did he say to you when he pulled up?
He asked me if I needed a ride.
-[Sinback] What did you say? -I told him yes.
The question came up, was I up for any action?
And the action, I guess you should know that it was insinuating sexual.
[Sinback] Did you know that when he said that? Yes, I did.
[Sinback] And what was the next part of conversation?
-[Cyntoia] Business. [laughs] -[Sinback] What did he say?
[Cyntoia] Well, he asked me how much, and I told him 200.
And he said, "No, 100," and we decided finally on 150.
[Sinback] Where did you go next?
We went to his house.
[Sinback] Who made the suggestion of going to his house?
[Cyntoia] He did. I had actually suggested the hotel we was right there at,
but he didn't want to go to the hotel.
He said he wanted to go to his house because there was no one there.
[Sinback] Did he tell you who he lived with or anything like that?
[Cyntoia] He said he lived by himself.
[Sinback] You're in the car, you have your food, and you're on the way home.
What kind of conversation did you have?
[Cyntoia] He was just basically talking about himself -and who he was, things that he did. -[Sinback] What did he tell you he did?
-and who he was, things that he did. -[Sinback] What did he tell you he did?
He told me he was a real estate agent,
and he said that he did a lot of volunteer work and stuff,
and he was real important in the community.
He was just finished telling me about his accomplishments
and saying how that he used to be in the Army,
because I mentioned that I was from Fort Campbell.
And so he related to how he was an officer in the Army before
and that he was a sharpshooter in the Army.
And then he had told me how a lot of women want him for his money
and that he wanted someone to make love with him with desire.
[Sinback] Okay. Did you see any guns in the house?
[Cyntoia] Yes, I seen two shotguns downstairs,
and he showed me a chrome gun with a black handle.
[Sinback] Where were you when he showed you that? [Cyntoia] I was sitting at the table, eating my food.
[Sinback] Okay. And how were you feeling at that time?
[Cyntoia] He was, like, controlling. He reminded me of Kut a little bit.
I start feeling nervous, then I kept feeling more nervous
as he started talking about the guns and stuff.
I was really shaky.
[Sinback] Do you usually go with people to their homes?
[scoffs] No.
[Sinback] Have you done this, prostituted before? -Yes. -[Sinback] Where have you done it?
-Yes. -[Sinback] Where have you done it? -In hotels. -[Sinback] Okay.
-In hotels. -[Sinback] Okay.
And what did you do then?
I asked him if we can go downstairs to the living room and watch TV.
-[Sinback] And what did he say? -He said sure.
[Sinback] Were you still feeling like you didn't want to go through with having sex?
The whole reason I went downstairs to the living room was so I'd be closer to the door.
[Sinback] Okay.
[Cyntoia] And so by the end I was like, "Well, you know, I'm tired.
Can I just go to sleep for a little while? I haven't had sleep in a while."
So I was hoping maybe we'd both fall asleep,
and while he was sound asleep, I'd just sneak on out.
And so then we went upstairs.
[Sinback] Do you tend to be a nervous person?
-Yeah. -[Sinback] Did anything make you
-Yeah. -[Sinback] Did anything make you -especially nervous that night? -[Cyntoia] Just how he was acting.
-especially nervous that night? -[Cyntoia] Just how he was acting.
Just how he talked. It's like the way he talked...
how he was just so important and stuff.
And then me, I look at myself. Who am I? Who am I to him? It's like...
Then he talks about the guns and stuff. If he does something to me,
I'm sitting here thinking, what can I do?
I'm in his house. Ain't nobody gonna know where I'm at.
My mom and them, they don't know where I'm at.
The people that I stay with, Chico and them, don't know where I'm at.
Nobody's gonna know what happens to me. Kut, he doesn't care.
He doesn't even know who I left with.
And all this is running through my mind, and I'm just a nervous wreck.
[Sinback] What happened next?
[Cyntoia] What happened next, about the fifth time he got in the bed...
It's like, at first, he was just stroking me, but then it's like he just grabbed me, like,
in between my legs, like, he just grabbed it real hard.
The whole time, every time he touched me I'd just move and act like I was asleep.
This time I just... [grunts]
Like that, and I turned over real hard.
And he just gave me this look. It was, like, a very fierce look.
[Cyntoia] And it just sent these chills up my spine.
I'm like, "Oh, my God. He's fixin' to hit me."
I'm thinking he's fixin' to hit me or do something like that,
but then he rolls over and reaches to the side of the bed or something.
I'm thinking he's not fixin' to hit me. He's fixin' to get a gun.
[Sinback] What did you do at that time?
I just grabbed the gun, and I shot him.
[man] Mr. Allen was asleep and facing away from you
-when you shot him. -[Cyntoia] No, sir.
[man] All right, what I want you to do is to explain to the Court how...
You have a gun in your purse on the nightstand.
-Correct? -[Cyntoia] Right.
[man] You don't want to do this. You don't want to be here.
So you felt like, if you tried to leave,
-he would harm you. -[Cyntoia] Right.
And your belief in that is based on the fact
And your belief in that is based on the fact that he told you he had some guns and he's a sharpshooter.
[Cyntoia] Not only that but the way he was acting.
[Burks] Well, all I know about his activities is what you've told us,
and that's really all we'll ever know...
-[Cyntoia] Right. -[Burks] ...since you killed him.
Your testimony today is that you felt he'd harm you if you tried to leave,
but you felt comfortable not only getting in the car and going home with him,
-but getting into bed with him. -The reason that I was acting asleep
was so he would go to sleep so then I could leave.
[Burks] Or... or, Ms. Brown, was it that so he would go to sleep
so you could shoot him and take all his stuff out of the house?
Why would I want to shoot somebody for no reason? That doesn't make no sense.
[Burks] Well, why did you shoot him?
I shot him because I thought he was gonna shoot me.
It would be a shock to me if I get transferred.
With everything that was said last night,
I can't see how that didn't touch the judge.
And how that couldn't wave her opinion to think,
"Okay, if I have the power to change this child's life,
I'm not gonna throw it away."
Hopefully, she's thinking along those lines.
I can't see why she wouldn't be.
You know, we'll never know what actually happened in Cyntoia's case.
You got paranoid that he was gonna do this, and so you shot him.
But then you go and take his wallet, his truck,
and that casts big-time doubt on your motives there.
Those are her facts. I don't necessarily agree with those facts.
[Cyntoia] You remember the transfer hearing?
Jeff Burks, you know the hostility between us?
He cross-examined me.
And he was questioning me like I was before the jury, was he not?
Adversarial proceeding, that's what it's not supposed to be,
and that's what it was.
It was a fucking trial, and the same issue was,
was it premeditated or self-defense? That was the whole issue, wasn't it?
That's the issue at this fucking trial.
This is my diary.
I just write little things.
I'm on my seventh page, telling my lawyers everything about me,
what started from day one,
so they can know... get a feel of me to work my case better.
I know they care for me, and they want the best for me.
'Cause I'm really expecting to go home or hoping to go home.
My biggest challenge for now is gonna be to keep from going crazy.
I'm not a murderer. I didn't viciously murder that man.
Why do y'all say that about me?
[Bernet] Her new attorney is Wendy Tucker.
And a couple months ago, Ms. Tucker sent me a message
asking me to continue with this evaluation.
And so now the questions are somewhat different
because she's gonna go to a criminal trial.
Cyntoia is charged with first-degree murder.
If the defense can show that she did not premeditate,
then the jury would say she does not meet the criteria for first-degree murder.
The definition depends on the mental state of the person who's committing the act.
So let's talk about -the waiver of Miranda rights. -[Tucker] Okay.
[Bernet] Now, my understanding of kind of the legal threshold is that the phraseology has to be done in a knowing, intelligent
that the phraseology has to be done in a knowing, intelligent -and voluntary manner. -Right.
Did she knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily
waive her right to remain silent?
[Bernet] I don't think it was knowing.
You know the whole thing about when you make a statement
that they read you your rights and stuff like that?
I know when they arrest you. -I've seen it on Cops. -Right.
They did it to me, but I didn't know it meant that you can be quiet.
Right. That's--
"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be held against you."
And all that, but I don't... [Bernet] That's what we'll talk about right now.
Says here, "You have the right to remain silent."
Do you understand that right?
-Yes or no? -Mm-hmm.
[Bernet] "Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law."
So tell me in your own words what that means.
Whatever you say, it'll go to court.
Man, I wish I'd have paid attention to this stuff.
Do you wish to waive that right and answer questions now?
-Say yes or no. -Yeah.
[Bernet] "You are entitled to consult with an attorney before interrogation
and to have an attorney present at the time of the interrogation."
-Tell me in your words what that means. -You can have a lawyer there with you.
[Bernet] Does it tell you a certain time when you can have a lawyer?
When they start asking questions.
[Bernet] "If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you."
If you're broke, then you can get a free lawyer.
Does this mean you're not gonna promise me anything as far as helping me if I talk?
But you just promised me that.
Right.
And that's saying that no one has promised me that, but you have.
Well, I'm sure that we're gonna... we'll do everything we can to help you.
If we can, you know... anything we can to help you, we will.
Tell me how this... how all these questions I was asking,
how do they fit into your situation?
[stammers] I don't know.
See, right now, I see it, and I understand them.
But then I didn't understand. -I was high, and I was tired. -Tell me about these--
-I was high, and I was tired. -Tell me about these--
[Cyntoia] Plus, they said that, if I told them, they could give me a deal.
[Bernet] What was he talking about? What kind of deal?
About time, and then he said,
"No, I promised that I would talk to the DA for you."
But that wasn't the same thing he said.
He said, "I promise you that, if you talk to us, cooperate with us,
we can get you a deal." I said, "Do you promise?" And he said yes.
[Bernet] What does it mean when he says, "I'll talk to the DA"?
I don't know. I'll talk to him about you--
[Bernet] He might talk to him every day about the weather or the football game.
Yeah, but he meant that he'd talk to him about getting me a deal.
[Bernet] But what... what would the deal be? What kind of deal?
Like less time to serve.
Because if I didn't, he said nine times out of ten I was gonna do life.
[Bernet] So, did he say--
And they screwed me because I might be doing life anyways.
[Bernet] They told her that they were gonna go to bat for her and--
Let me stop you right there because that's real important.
Because when I watch the tape,
it proves that she's telling the truth.
[Bernet] There's some discussion in the very beginning.
-Something happened. -[Tucker] "You did promise me something."
Right, that comment by her, as soon as I heard it, I said, "Damn!"
[Bernet] Then they said, "Well, we didn't promise you anything.
We simply said that we would talk to the DA."
-They acknowledged that they-- -[Bernet] Would talk to the--
In their view, they would say that we would talk to the DA,
but in her view, they said, "We will talk to the DA and get you a better deal."
She did really poorly on...
her belief that the right thing to do, the correct thing to do
is to tell the police everything you know.
-When you take the results of the test... -Mm-hmm.
-...and add to it the promise implicitly-- -[Bernet] Right. Right.
Then she's doubly mistaken.
She comes into the room with this kind of false belief
that you're better off if you talk to the police, and on top of that...
they mislead her.
I think it's a double-- I think they combine.
It's two very large men interrogating her too, by the way.
-[Bernet] Yeah. -[chuckles]
[Cyntoia] "When it comes to the charge of first-degree murder,
we, the jury, find Cyntoia Brown guilty.
When it comes to the charge of felony murder...
we, the jury, find Cyntoia Brown guilty.
When it comes to the charge of especially aggravated robbery,
we, the jury, find Cyntoia Brown guilty."
Those are the words I fear most, more than anything else in life.
I really fantasize about getting out a lot.
I think that takes a lot of my time, daydreaming,
and I know I really shouldn't be doing that
so I won't get upset if that doesn't happen.
But I just can't help it.
I think the 16-year-old Cyntoia was more reckless.
She'd say anything, do anything, just wild.
I don't think that I'm an adult yet.
I wouldn't even say a young adult. I'd say I'm coming into adulthood.
But the 18-year-old Cyntoia, she really-- She really thinks-- She understands now
that what people think of you and your impression on other people
is very important in life sometimes.
Maybe some other 18-year-olds can handle being at a murder trial
and not getting upset when people sit up here
and throw bogus lies about you, but I can't. It's hard for me.
I think I'll feel more fear and anxiety when I get upstairs
and put on the clothes and get in the actual courtroom
when I see the jury.
It's hard for me to look at them 'cause I don't know,
should I look at them? Should I not look at them?
You gotta think about how you look and make sure you're not doing nothing.
And you got to make sure you don't make no faces or nothing.
And you got to really control yourself. That's kind of hard for an 18-year-old.
[man] We need to add probably self-defense in the jury instruction.
Some of that's gonna come out.
[bailiff] All rise.
His Honor, J. Randall Wyatt...
[Burks] Johnny Allen...
was a realty agent in the Antioch-South Nashville area.
This defendant, Cyntoia Brown, shot Johnny Allen in the head,
in his bed, in his home,
but gives a wild theory of how it was self-defense.
At the end of the day, you will hear the medical examiner describe
how Johnny Allen's hands were in this manner here when he was found.
We'll ask the medical examiner what that means in this case.
We submit that, at the end of the proof, you will hear that Cyntoia Brown...
cruelly and mercilessly executed Johnny Allen.
We'll ask that you convict her at the end of the proof. Thank you.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, you will learn
that Cyntoia Brown certainly had her issues.
She was a 16-year-old runaway.
She was living on the streets
with her 24-year-old boyfriend, Garion McGlothen.
You will learn that his nickname on the streets was Kut-Throat.
And you will learn that that was a very appropriate name for him.
Since running away, Cyntoia Brown had been beaten... pimped... and raped.
And when she felt that Johnny Allen moved,
she was sure that he was gonna get a gun, rape her, kill her, something.
She was sure that she had to react, and she made a split-second decision
to choose between safety and Johnny Allen's dark side,
and she chose safety.
At the close of all the evidence, Mr. McGee will stand in front of you,
and he will request that you return
the only just verdict possible in this case.
And that is a verdict of not guilty on all charges for Cyntoia Brown.
Thank you.
Detective Robinson, let's go back in time. August the 8th, 2004,
3:28 in the morning.
Because it was in the interview room at the police department across the street
that you and Detective Baltimore questioned Cyntoia Brown.
[Robinson] Yes.
[McGee] Before the tape got turned on in this case,
you spoke to Cyntoia Brown off-camera, didn't you, sir?
Very briefly. Whatever I said to Ms. Brown was very brief.
"We're gonna go back here in this room. We're gonna talk,"
and it wasn't long at all.
[McGee] We see on the tape, and we heard on the tape the process beginning.
When you got to that portion of the form, detective,
where you read no promises or threats have been made,
Ms. Brown interrupted you. We saw it on the tape.
-Didn't she? -She did.
[McGee] She said, "Promises of what?"
-Remember saying that, detective? -[Robinson] I recall telling her
that we will let the district attorney know that she cooperated with us
and gave us a statement and indicated
they usually take that into consideration.
We're talking about lying.
That is a technique that you have been trained to use.
-Right? -[Robinson] Exaggeration, yes.
My name is Dr. Amy R. McMaster.
I'm the Deputy Chief Medical Examiner for Davidson County,
and my official duties are to investigate
causes of sudden, unnatural or unexpected death.
[Naylor] How would you describe his injury
as to whether he would be able to survive if for any period of time?
No, with this wound, Mr. Allen--
This would've been an immediately fatal wound.
[Naylor] His hands are clasped in the photographs. Do you see that?
[McMaster] Yes, I do.
[Naylor] Do you have an opinion
as to whether his hands were clasped at the time of his death?
[McMaster] Mr. Allen would have been in this position at the time that the wound was inflicted.
Because of the nature of the wound, I would not expect Mr. Allen
to have any type of voluntary movement
or be able to move his extremities or his body in any way.
[Naylor] Could you please state and spell your name for the record?
Yes, my name is Ellenette R. Brown.
[Naylor] Do you know Cyntoia Brown?
[Brown] Yes, I do.
-[Naylor] How do you know her? -She is my daughter.
-[Naylor] Is she your adopted daughter? -[Brown] Yes, she is.
[Naylor] Do you talk with her on the phone and keep up with her?
Almost daily, yes.
[Naylor] Judge, at this time, we're gonna ask for the main exhibit
we be allowed to play this for the jury, in which she refers
we be allowed to play this for the jury, in which she refers -to executing Mr. Allen. Is that correct? -Yes. Yes.
-to executing Mr. Allen. Is that correct? -Yes. Yes.
[Brown, over recording] They have nothing else to do but to provoke you.
The more time you get the better it is for them.
[Cyntoia] Now you understand why I'm so depressed,
-I have nothing to do. -[Brown] Well...
[Cyntoia] I have to think about that every day.
-[Brown] What? -[Cyntoia] Me facing life.
I probably won't have a life anyways, Ma, it don't matter how I behave.
You don't understand. I killed somebody.
-[Brown] I know you did. -[Cyntoia] I executed him.
[Brown] Why do you say stuff like that, Toia?
You're making it so easy for the prosecution.
[Cyntoia] But, I mean, it's not my fault.
[Brown] That's what I'm sayin'.
[Cyntoia] I've been facing life since day one.
[Brown] Well, see, I wasn't thinkin' like that.
Every single time, when you visited that you talked about her situation,
Cyntoia told you that she shot Mr. Allen because she was fearful of him.
-Didn't she? -[Brown] Yes.
[Tucker] So when you had this phone conversation,
and she said the words, "I killed a man. I executed him, Mommy,"
did you think that was some sudden change of her confessing to you what happened?
No, um, Cyntoia has a way of taking things out of context.
Not so much as her trying to confess to me.
All she wanted was to be able to do what she's done times again,
sit on my lap, talk to me, let me know what's going on, how she's feeling.
And saying, "I know what my outcome is,
so you go on and you do what you have to do. Don't waste it on me."
One of the things Cyntoia Brown counts on today, is banking on,
is that you will drop the common sense you've had all your life
when you come through that door. She's counting on it.
And she's counting on you to look at this picture...
and believe that the person that did this damage to another human being
was acting in self-defense.
Shot through the back of the head?
Hands like that?
The medical examiner's opinion? Not-- Not-- That wasn't really challenged yesterday. You remember that.
That wasn't really challenged yesterday. You remember that.
Medical examiner's opinion was he was in this position when he was shot.
As you go through that door and into that jury room,
I ask that you recall that one passage.
"You don't understand what I did, Mama.
I killed a man. I executed him."
We've spent four days proving
what she says in that phone call to her mother was absolutely accurate.
She executed Johnny.
Johnny Allen was a man...
who by day was a mild-mannered real estate agent,
who went to church, taught a Bible study.
But there were times in his life when he was certainly not that man.
What 43-year-old men are driving around
on a Friday night to Sonic's
and driving home with young girls,
girls described as so young the waitress said,
"I thought she was his daughter or his niece."
She did take some items after the fact, and she's guilty of that.
I'm not trying to tell you Cyntoia Brown is an angel.
We never have.
We've told you from the beginning that she was a 16-year-old runaway
doing the best she could,
and on August the 6th, she thought she was gonna have a night
where she would be safe.
She was wrong.
As to these charges of murder, not guilty.
As to this charge of especially aggravated robbery, not guilty.
Not guilty. Not guilty!
That was not her intent when she shot him, and you know it. And you know it.
[Cyntoia] One minute, I think they're gonna convict me of voluntary manslaughter and theft,
and the next minute, I think I'm gonna be found guilty of all charges.
Just thinking about it, I don't know, it gives me the chills.
...it's bizarre. There's no grocery stores...
[Wyatt] Has the jury arrived at a verdict in this case?
[juror] Yes, sir, we have.
Please stand and tell the Court what that verdict is.
We, the jury, find the defendant, Cyntoia Denise Brown...
count one, guilty, first-degree murder.
Count two, guilty of felony murder.
Count three, guilty of especially aggravated robbery.
This is our verdict this 25th day of August, 2006.
[Wyatt] Thank you.
Hey, Mommy.
Fine, what are you doing?
Well, I got life.
Yeah, it's over with now.
I'll be fine.
Yes, ma'am.
Mama, don't stress yourself out.
I don't want you having a stroke and a heart attack or nothing.
'Cause that's the only thing that would get to me.
And I have one mama.
So...
Yeah.
And even if it is, my life's not over.
And I will get old.
So, this is just a change of plan.
I love you too. Tell Uncle Frank I love him.
And tell him we still have things that we could do.
Yes, ma'am.
Love you too.
Okay.
Right.
Bye, Mommy. I love you too.
[Brown] When I got the phone call, it was early in the morning, you know, about 6:00 a.m.
When it all finally sank in...
the worst feeling was like someone was just ripping my heart out.
It hurts me that she's been placed in such a serious situation.
Amidst it all, I'm still here, you know,
and I'm coping the best that I know.
I think the biggest surprise to me was probably the sexual part in her life.
No parent wants to think that their young daughter is experiencing sex,
especially at such a young age,
and then to find out that there's been many boys and men.
I feel sad that there's a possibility that outside of the glass
I feel sad that there's a possibility that outside of the glass and the barbed wire and the bars
that we may never actually be...
like a mother and daughter should be.
This is real.
If she's ever here in this house, she may not be here with me.
That's very real to me.
And I think about that all the time.
I think about it all the time.
[Mitchell] I got pregnant on my 16th birthday.
I was confused, misled, misguided.
My mother, we didn't live in a very stable home.
The home was stable, but my mother was not stable.
The mental health problems all start with her.
You'll be able to see that for yourself within two minutes of talking to her.
So I got the attention that I needed from friends and from male companions.
I was drinking and smoking marijuana.
And my mom had vodka. They had liquor in the cabinet.
And I would take the vodka, and I would be blitzed by the time I got to school.
When I got pregnant, I was... I was drinking.
I could drink a bottle that was this big by myself.
Pretty sure she won't be happy to see me.
But, you know, it's vice versa.
If I had it every day, I could drink it every day.
If I didn't have it, we were definitely gonna find a way to get it.
I drank for about eight months of her life, and the eighth month,
that's when I was introduced to crack cocaine.
I was 17 years old.
And so when I got introduced to crack cocaine,
I also got introduced to the easy money on how to get it, which was prostituting.
I was raped repeatedly, guns to my head, robbed, everything.
And so, December the 13th, 1988...
that's when I went to jail.
If I don't say too much around here, it's best.
Because, if she gets started, it's just gonna send me into a whirlwind.
I'm gonna go berserk.
I already know it. She knows how to push my buttons.
She knows which ones to touch.
And it doesn't take very long 'cause we usually can't stay
And it doesn't take very long 'cause we usually can't stay around each other no more than five or ten minutes.
[woman] Toia, I talked with her attorney in the beginning.
As the young attorney did say, being in the state of Tennessee...
had a lot to do with the trial.
We can't change anything about it. But this girl's young.
I'm not saying you should say, "Here, go right out here and start living."
I think she should be released gradually.
So she understands herself...
knows how to handle it.
What are you saying?
She may have to be on some types of drugs all her life.
She is. We are.
Well, there's nothing wrong with that.
I've been taking psychotropics since I can... remember.
Do you see anything wrong with it, if you have a problem?
-It's no more than having-- -I could understand one or two people
being throwed off, but the whole damn family? Come on now.
[Warren] The fruit does not fall too far from the tree.
I think that my mother probably should have had a hysterectomy when she was 16.
Now, I really think that
because, see, if I had been as educated then as I am now,
I probably would not have had my children
and put them through what they have gone through.
And I think a lot of it is genetics.
This family probably needs therapy more than-- You know, to bring it closer.
[Mitchell] I'm not gonna sit in no room with all of my family.
I can't do it. I won't even go to--
I do one-on-one.
I'm not gonna sit-- A group of crazy people cannot tell me
I'm not gonna sit-- A group of crazy people cannot tell me -what the hell is wrong with me. -[chuckling]
[man] Patsy Cottrell, who was a court of appeals judge in Tennessee
and the widow of Ross Alderman,
who was the public defender in Nashville at the time Cyntoia was first charged,
called me to say that this documentary was gonna be shown at the Green Hills theater
as a part of the film festival.
So I went on a Saturday afternoon, I think, in April of 2010
to see the documentary, and it was amazing.
That story moved me because you could just--
You could see that this young woman didn't get a fair shake.
There was more to this story than the courts knew at the time.
So I reached out to my best friend, Houston Gordon.
[Gordon] I had not seen the documentary at that time,
but he had it to take home and look at.
He told me about the alcohol abuse of her mother.
In fact, Dan Birman's interview with Georgina Mitchell, Cyntoia's mother,
gave the history of the alcohol abuse.
Here's a kid who didn't have a chance.
She didn't have a chance before she was born.
She didn't have a chance after she was born.
And that affected her all the way from the transfer hearing
all the way through, quite frankly, to the present.
Once she was convicted of those crimes,
it was 51 years before she's eligible for parole, 60-year sentence.
[Bone] We spent a lot of time and money
to find the very best experts on the fetal alcohol syndrome
who could come and evaluate Cyntoia specifically
and talk about the science of the brain.
She still has that...
-impulsive... -She does. ...piece that really worries me that, you know...
We developed a plan to take this back to the criminal court in Davidson County
and to ask for post-conviction relief and to present our case.
When you look at all this, was it a fundamentally fair trial?
And, you know, of course, I'm passionate about it,
and we believe that we have a good chance of convincing the Court of just that.
[Cyntoia] I've questioned out loud, how am I gonna do this?
How am I supposed to do this time?
Am I supposed to spend the rest of my life in prison?
'Cause it hurts. I want to go home, and I can't.
My 22nd birthday was kind of hard because I looked at it like
I was supposed to be graduating college, but I'm in here.
It's made me stronger. It's made me wiser, more resilient at times.
I'm actually going to college. Surprise!
[Gordon] How are you?
-Good. How are you? -I'm okay.
[Cyntoia] Lipscomb University, they come out, and they hold class here once a week.
And yeah, we get to obtain an associate's degree in Letters, Arts and Sciences.
That's what I'm doing right now. That's what my life focus is on right now.
I'm also still trying to get back in court and work on my case and stuff.
[Gordon] This is a case that, not only would make a difference
hopefully for Cyntoia, but may make a difference
for these thousands upon thousands of children
who are born in situations that they can't control.
[Wyatt] Good morning to everyone.
We're ready to get started on the hearing, and good morning to all the lawyers here.
-[man] Good morning. -[Wyatt] Mr. Gordon.
-Mr. Charles Bone, go right ahead. -[Bone] Thank you.
I'm here with Mr. Bruno and Mr. Gordon,
and we're pro bono counsel for Cyntoia Brown.
We intend to show to the Court today
that Ms. Brown's sentence that was received in this court in 2006
is the functional equivalent of a life sentence without parole.
Your Honor will have the opportunity to hear
the first really extensive discussion and diagnosis
of a Tennessee juvenile with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, FASD.
Unfortunately, the content for the presentation of this information
and these findings must come in the context that Cyntoia suffered
also from the ineffective assistance from counsel.
And at the conclusion of the hearing, we believe Your Honor will find
by clear and convincing determination
that Cyntoia Brown deserves a new trial.
As the Court knows, probably recalls,
I was assigned to juvenile court at the time this took place.
I did the transfer hearing in this case.
I have known this case for eight years now.
This evidence of fetal alcohol syndrome that's about to be presented to the Court,
I would ask the Court to look closely at its reliability
and whether it would have been admissible in the trial if shown.
The bottom line is that the allegation here is that Rich McGee and Wendy Tucker,
The bottom line is that the allegation here is that Rich McGee and Wendy Tucker, two attorneys very well known to the Court,
were ineffective in not presenting evidence.
We will contend that it is impossible to show that there was a deficiency
in the representation she received, or that, if there were, it would--
The lack of it would have resulted in a different outcome.
[Bruno] Ms. Tucker, at the time of your representation of Ms. Brown,
were you familiar with the disease of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder?
Had you ever heard of that or knew anything about that?
I am sure I had heard of it.
I know I've never presented a defense regarding fetal alcohol syndrome.
I don't know if I ever had any clients
where it was something in their records or not, but I'm sure I'd heard of it.
I became much more familiar with it after Mr. Birman interviewed some people.
[Bruno] Did you seek the assistance of any medical expert
in the area of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder?
[Tucker] I did not.
[Burks] Now, you were asked about fetal alcohol syndrome.
[Tucker] Right.
Was that something you'd ever heard of at this time?
[Tucker] I'm sure I'd heard of it at the time.
[Burks] Was it something that Dr. Bernet ever mentioned to your memory?
[Tucker] Not to my memory, no.
Had a mental health professional mentioned it to you,
you would have looked into it, fair to say.
Yes, I hope so.
I wish they had. I wish I had.
[Gordon] What is fetal alcohol spectrum disorder?
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is referred to as an umbrella term,
and they all relate to the fact that alcohol is a particularly heinous poison
to the developing fetus.
Tell the Court, if you would,
what the effect in general would be on a fetus
whose mother was drinking
the way that Georgina Mitchell has testified she was drinking.
[Adler] Alcohol is considered
one of the worst toxins, one of the worst poisons.
The brain is the organ that's most negatively affected.
[Gordon] Did you make an examination
-and evaluation of Cyntoia Brown? -[Adler] Yes.
[Gordon] When did you do that?
[Adler] June the 24th of 2011.
What conclusion, if any, did you come to as to whether she had had brain damage?
[Adler] Simply, Ms. Brown has alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder,
-and I would like to explain if I could. -[Gordon] Please.
So she is seriously impaired.
If you just look at her cognitive or neuropsychological testing alone,
the discrepancy between her tested IQ
and her other abilities is really remarkable.
She does not function like a person.
Her functional abilities are terrible.
So terrible, they are equivalent to a person with mild mental retardation,
and that is not inconsequential.
It's known that persons with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
have a markedly higher rate of problems with the law.
[Gordon] Was she suffering that at the time of August 2004, at the time of this incident?
Yes.
[Gordon] Was she suffering from it before then? [Adler] Yes.
-[Gordon] Is she suffering from that now? -Yes.
[Gordon] Is that something she's going to suffer the rest of her life?
More or less, yes.
[Gordon] Thank you, Your Honor.
We appreciate the opportunity to bring these issues before the Court.
What is the clear and convincing evidence here?
I believe that's our burden. The clear and convincing evidence is
she has this brain damage.
She had it because her mother admittedly abused alcohol
the entire time she was carrying the baby.
That brain damage has caused her to not be able to control herself,
and when she sees chaos, not respond to it adequately.
I appreciate the Court's attention, and I respectfully ask
that, when we submit our proposals to you, I know the Court will do justice.
[Burks] A number of things I want to point out to the Court briefly
about the evidence the Court has heard.
Number one, much of the basis of what the Court's heard came
from the defendant's mother
who is an inmate in a federal prison.
Her assertions about what she did when she was pregnant with Ms. Brown
could never be proven or disproven.
It would be argued to a jury by any competent state's attorney
that these diagnoses by the scientists seem to explain away
any bad behavior on the part of Ms. Brown
in her past or in this particular incident.
A jury trial is not about giving the jury
a full and complete picture of the defendant's mental makeup.
The jury trial is about whether the state has proof beyond a reasonable doubt on the essential elements.
proof beyond a reasonable doubt on the essential elements.
[Wyatt] Thank you. All right. The transcripts will be available
-the first Monday in December. -[Gordon] Thank you.
And then how long did you want to prepare your memorandum or whatever it is?
-[Gordon] Fifteen days. -That's fine too.
What about Friday the 14th of December? Is that enough time?
And then I'll take it under advisement,
and then sometime several weeks after that, I'll reach a decision.
That's it. We'll close the court. Court is adjourned.
[Gordon] Post-conviction relief, the appeal of her conviction,
is a very limited opportunity for relief.
The judge acknowledged that she did have alcohol-related disorder.
We proved that she could not control her impulses.
[Cyntoia] I can tell you all kinds of stuff about a long time ago,
but you can tell me right now, "Cyntoia, don't do this. Make sure you don't do this." I'll say, "I know, I know. I got you."
Make sure you don't do this." I'll say, "I know, I know. I got you."
And, like, two seconds later, I'll do it.
I mean, I don't know. It makes me look at myself different a little.
[Gordon] You have to show that no reasonable jury would have found her guilty if that legal error had been corrected.
would have found her guilty if that legal error had been corrected.
It's a pretty steep hill to climb.
And so he denied the relief.
[Cyntoia] I'm having trouble reconciling that.
So what does that mean? I don't-- I don't get it.
And it's-- It pisses me off.
I mean, my life is gonna continue.
I'm not gonna stop just because what they said,
but I mean, I'll remember it.
[Warren] There's a lot of sadness and lies and pain
and not knowing what to do about any of it.
What can we do?
You know the sadness of Toia's eyes.
It came from genetics, and the genetics should stop.
My life has been so horrible.
The rapes, the beatings.
I was a victim of that type of person.
Tommy came to my house, and during the time that I was washing dishes,
he grabbed me and snatched me and started beating me and drug me to the bedroom.
And he says,
"You're gonna get what you deserve."
And then... and then came... came the rape.
I just lay there, and I cried.
And I pulled myself together, put on makeup.
That's what abused families usually does to keep anybody from knowing it.
I got pregnant from that particular rape.
But you know, you can use the word "rape" in many ways
because I feel like all of us has been raped of our life
when this incident happened to me.
You have to pack it back, and you have to hide it so you can go on living.
When you go through therapy, you have to close doors
and open doors and close doors.
These doors are never, never closed.
You never go on and say, "Oh, I'm all right. Life is very happy."
No.
You carry it from then on.
And I don't know if there's enough love or enough support that will ever...
help Gina or Toia or many other girls.
I don't think there's any hope of either three of us turning back...
from the pain of what we've gone through.
It's just something we're gonna have to live through one way or the other.
[Mitchell] If my mama would have been that role model...
there would be no Cyntoia Brown story.
I wouldn't be sitting here talking to y'all.
Childhood abuse... molestation.
That's where a lot of hate for my mom formed around.
His name was Walter.
He was a relative of the neighbor.
He molested me from the time I was maybe six or seven up until I was ten.
And the places he took me was no different from here.
I mean, there were woods.
If we didn't go to the woods in his truck...
we were at his house.
I would just lay there frozen and relieved when it was over with.
Then he would give me $20 and take me home.
That's sex trafficking at its finest.
I mean, when your own mother sends you out to be molested by a man
after you've repeatedly... and begged her not--
"I don't want to go. I don't want to go."
"You don't believe me? Do you hate me that much?
Do you hate me that much that you allow somebody to do this?"
You know, when you go through sexual abuse as a child,
you go from being scared,
you build hate.
It's sad.
No child should have to go through that.
No woman should have to go through that. No man should have to go through that.
Is it fair?
It's not fair at all.
But that's the world that we live in.
[Cyntoia, over phone] I think more about how my actions and my behaviors affect other people.
I think the fact that I realized that
is probably one of the biggest changes between me at 28 and me at 16.
I care more about how what I do affects other people.
I don't really deal with a lot of people in here
who are doing stuff they have no business doing.
Not only because that's just not who I want to be,
but it's not the kind of stuff I want in my life.
I go to college. I go to Lipscomb.
I go to college. I go to Lipscomb. I've got a degree from Lipscomb, but it's more than that.
It's about maintaining positive, healthy relationships
with positive, healthy people.
Life in prison, it's not a life.
You have to kind of fight to carve out a life for yourself
that has some kind of meaning, that has some kind of worth and some kind of value.
I think that that's really at the heart of rehabilitation
when you have been forced to grow up in prison.
And I think that is really what was... what was going on with me
and what was behind my change.
I don't want a life in prison. I want to have a life.
Today, in 2017, Cyntoia Brown would be classified a sex slave,
a little child manipulated who didn't stand a chance
against the men who used her,
but that wasn't the case in 2004.
Filmmaker Dan Birman shared video from his seven years
documenting Cyntoia Brown's case.
[Cyntoia, over phone] I want a second chance.
Cyntoia Brown. She's been in prison for more than a decade now,
but her case is catching fire on social media, #FreeCyntoiaBrown,
after being shared on Instagram by pop superstar Rihanna.
[Case] Now celebrities like Rihanna, T.I. and Lana Del Rey
are tweeting for clemency for Cyntoia,
a sex-trafficked teen doing life in prison.
[Bone] #FreeCyntoiaBrown became such an amazing experience.
I guess there were a million tweets.
The attention that Cyntoia's case has received
is an important worldwide event...
that provides an avenue for consideration of children
across the world, not just in the United States,
not just in Tennessee.
Cyntoia made the decision that the timing was appropriate
to seek the help of the governor because we knew
the governor was going into his last year in office.
Governor Haslam will have served eight years
in January of 2019.
Once all of your state appeals are over, you then have a final opportunity,
I guess you'd say in criminal law, to be heard.
We filed the petition for clemency
with the Board of Parole and with the governor.
They don't do a lot of hearings on clemency.
This was filed on behalf of Cyntoia on December the 19th, 2017.
It starts interestingly with a letter from Cyntoia to the governor,
why she thinks it's so appropriate for her to be honored with clemency from him.
And then what we do is go through her legal and procedural backgrounds.
It starts, as a matter of fact,
with the letter from the president of Lipscomb University, Randy Lowry,
and speaks to her 4.0 grade point average.
And then many letters from people in the community,
from the mayor, from the juvenile judge, from advocacy groups
who say, you know, she's the perfect person to be considered for... for clemency.
Dr. Bernet, he said,
"Recently, I was contacted by Ms. Brown's current attorney
who requested my support in Ms. Brown's application for clemency."
[Bernet] Thirteen years had elapsed between my meetings with Cyntoia.
I originally evaluated her when she was 16,
and then I saw her a few months ago when she was 29.
I think the most general description is that she had grown up,
both intellectually and socially.
I think another general impression was that she had learned a lot.
She had a broader understanding, I think, of life and society,
that she was studying interesting things in college.
She herself had gotten interested in the problem of sexual trafficking.
When I interviewed her, she was in the process of writing a term paper...
on that topic.
She managed to share through her own experience
and through things she had read and studied on this topic.
And she had a lot of really good ideas
for how to use that knowledge outside of the prison.
[Gordon] Pardon and Parole Board...
they've made the decision to hear Cyntoia on her request for commutation.
The governor has the absolute constitutional right
to grant relief on commutation.
But before he will take any action,
he wants the opinion of the Pardon and Parole Board.
And that's what we're going to do this next week.
The purpose of which is to show that Cyntoia Brown has been rehabilitated
since her incarceration
and that she can be a useful member of society
and, in all likelihood, will be if she receives a commuted sentence.
In 2004, she was considered to be a prostitute
even though she was 16 years old.
That has changed.
If it happened today, she would not be considered a crime
but a victim of sexual predators.
We are requesting the Pardon and Parole Board
to recommend to the governor
that he commute her sentence to second-degree murder.
If he does that, then that would make her eligible for parole.
She will still have a criminal record.
She will still lose a lot of the rights that ordinary citizens have...
but she will have an opportunity
to live a useful and productive life outside of the prison system.
[man 1] Today is May the 23rd, 2018.
We are conducting an executive clemency hearing at Tennessee Prison for Women.
This will be a commutation hearing for Cyntoia Denise Brown.
Tennessee Code annotated 40-28-125A
authorizes the board to advise and make recommendations to the governor
in respect to pardons,
exonerations and commutations.
The governor has said he will use his clemency powers very sparingly.
Ms. Brown, you will be permitted to speak and to present witnesses
on your behalf.
At this time, I'd like to allow your counsel, Mr. Bone,
to give an opening statement, and then, Ms. Brown,
we would like to hear from you in your own words
about why you feel that you are rehabilitated
and no longer a risk to safety of the public.
So with that, Mr. Bone?
[Bone] This is a story of transformation
in the life of a wasted child who has become
a beautiful, intelligent, caring, educated woman
who can make things better in this world, and that's why we're here.
[Cyntoia] I just wanted to say thank you, first.
I know a lot of people get to see you, but I have prayed for a very long time...
to be able to meet with you.
And I know it's purely an act of mercy that you even give me a hearing,
and that means everything to me.
What I did was horrible.
I killed Johnny Allen, and he's gone. And it stayed with me this whole time.
I was locked up at 16. It was like that was it.
I have no choice but to live a different life,
and they've given me that opportunity.
They've given me that chance.
You know, I can't make up for what I did,
but they've given me a chance to do so much more.
Whatever you decide, I respect it, but...
I do pray that you show me mercy and that you give me a second chance.
[man 2] In 2008, I was working as a prosecutor in the Tennessee Attorney General's Office,
and the case of Cyntoia Denise Brown was assigned to me.
And so it was my job to represent the state in her appeal.
I read every page of the trial transcript, and I examined every exhibit.
And I argued that she needed to spend the rest of her life in prison.
Cyntoia, I met her in the spring of 2009.
I just went blindly into the class not knowing who she was
and didn't know who she was for weeks
until, one day, I got a court opinion in the mail.
I open the envelope, see what it is,
and there's Cyntoia's name on it, Cyntoia Denise Brown.
And that was the first time that I figured out
the Cyntoia Denise Brown whose appeal I had worked on
was the same Cyntoia Brown who was this luminous student in my class.
She got her copy of the opinion the next day or a couple of days later.
She came to class the following Wednesday night,
and we briefly talked about it.
I told her that I was sorry.
She said, "You were doing your job."
I could tell that she was hurt
because, on top of being disappointed that her appeal just got denied...
now she has to go through the rest of the semester with the guy who argued, "Yeah, 51 years is exactly right."
with the guy who argued, "Yeah, 51 years is exactly right."
Justice is not just about saying,
"What crime was committed, and how much time does this person get."
And having cultivated some understanding about the context in which
her crime occurred, but a lot of people's crimes occur,
I think justice is more about trying to achieve the right outcome
than it is about alleging rule violations.
Time and proximity are funny things
because they can change adversaries into allies.
Here I am ten years later...
not arguing against her but arguing in favor of her release.
And I do that because I have borne witness along with all these other folks
to the kind of person that Cyntoia is.
[Sinback] Ladies and gentlemen of the board, I am honored to come before you today
as Cyntoia Brown's juvenile court attorney and friend of 14 years.
I would like to tell you only about the Cyntoia Brown of today,
the remarkable woman you've been hearing so much about,
but I would be remiss if I did not also tell you
about the Cyntoia Brown I met on August 9th, 2004,
three days after the horrible incident that caused her to be in here.
When I represented Cyntoia when she was 16 at the transfer hearing,
my goal was to really show who Cyntoia was.
She had been through a lot of really hard things in her life.
What really brought it full circle for me
was when I became involved in the case again,
working with Cyntoia and working on her clemency.
I realized that I was really using the same strategy
that I had used during the transfer hearing
to really show that she's a person who can be in the community
and that she deserves to have a chance to live a life.
When I was a defense attorney,
it always was very interesting when people would ask me,
"Why fight for someone like that?
Why fight for a person who has taken a life?
How can you defend that person who's guilty?
What if they get out and do the same thing again?"
-Hi, guys. -[students] Hi.
-How you doing? Good to see you today. -[students] Good.
Um, so we've been talking about juvenile transfer and the situation that you all are in.
Cyntoia's case fits into the issue of sentencing reform
by showing us that children deserve a review,
not necessarily parole or release,
but that all children deserve us to take a look at them
after a fair number of years.
The community is ready to welcome Cyntoia into its fold and to see her face-to-face,
not as the child she was in 2004,
but as the incredible, incredible woman that she has become.
Thank you.
[Montgomery] What I would like to do now is go to the victim's side.
Just tell me your name, if you would please,
and make any comment you'd like to make.
[woman 1] My name is Anna Whaley.
I'm a close personal friend of Johnny
and his family.
Johnny has a voice, and Johnny's family has a voice.
It's not been heard in all these years, but today I am that voice.
Cyntoia has done great harm...
and Johnny did not deserve to die.
I hope...
I hope sincerely God has transformed her life.
I do.
Johnny's life mattered.
Johnny was loved, and he is missed dearly. And this is a very sad story.
Thank you.
[Montgomery] I am ready to vote.
I'm going to agree to the commutation of second-degree murder.
[woman 2] My recommendation to the governor will be
to recommend changing Defendant Brown's parole eligibility date
to August of 2029, in other words, after serving 25 years.
My recommendation to the governor will be to decline your application.
[Montgomery] So you have heard all of the different recommendations
that will be going to the governor.
We will do a report. He will decide what he will do.
As we said earlier, this is a recommendation to him.
-He makes the final decision. -Thank you.
[Bone] We end up with a divided group in terms of the decision that they made.
Two who thought to lower the sentence from first-degree to second-degree
and two who thought her term should be lowered to 25 years.
And then two who thought there should be no relief.
We don't know.
So we'll see what the governor says.
[Brown] How things have changed for me the last 14 years?
There has been times that, you know, I really wanted to give up.
I allowed myself to get in that place of despair.
But through it all, I feel that I have persevered
because the one constant
that has always been in Cyntoia's life has been me.
And I know, if I allow myself to fall apart,
then who does she have?
Where are her hopes and where are her dreams?
The emotional roller coaster that I've been on is...
like nothing that you ever experienced.
Because, at this point now, I don't allow myself to hope.
I want to and I do hope that, in the end, everything is gonna be
the way I pray for it to be, and that's to have her home.
And I'm thinking...
...it's gonna happen this time.
It's gonna happen.
And then it doesn't happen.
Going to see Cyntoia is... [laughs] ...pretty routine for me.
I think the biggest change that I've seen in... in Toia
since I've been making this drive down here is...
She's more open.
You know, for a very long time, she couldn't really
or didn't really express truly how she felt about things.
We still don't know the outcome, but now we can honestly say there is hope.
People know what has happened in this state, and people are watching.
If he says yes, Toia can walk out a free woman.
It's gonna hurt us all if he says no.
We're leaving the office now.
We're going to try to communicate to Cyntoia
the decision that the governor has made.
[woman, over phone] Do you know what building we're going in?
Yeah, we're going in where we've always gone in.
[Sinback, over phone] The visitation building?
[Bone] The governor's lawyer, Dwight Tarwater, called
and said, "We want y'all to come meet with us tomorrow morning,
but you can't tell anybody.
This is a strictly private meeting."
We went in to see Dwight,
and he says, "Hold on a minute. Let me go see if the governor's ready."
We didn't have any idea we were gonna meet with the governor.
Can you imagine holding your breath for minutes while you're waiting?
And the governor said, "I want to tell you what we're gonna do."
The governor is gonna commute her sentence to 15 years.
And that'll end in August.
She's gonna move to the transition group for the next seven months,
and she's gonna be on probation for ten years.
We walked in. I got the first hug, and I said,
"You're getting out in August," because I wanted it to just be.
-You know, I didn't want any suspense. -[line ringing]
So, you know, she started dancing.
She just couldn't have been more excited, and it was just perfect, just perfect.
So she's really, really happy, so--
-[woman, over phone] Did she cry? -Did she cry?
-[woman, over phone] Did she cry? -Did she cry? -Yeah. -[Eckerman] Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah, everybody cried. -[Eckerman] Oh! [gasps]
-Oh, hallelujah! -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I told her also to try to call a little after 11:00,
and we might even be able to put her on the speakerphone someplace.
You ready? Okay. I'm gonna put you on speakerphone, okay?
We have a really large group, and... but we wanted you to be able to say hello
and thank you to the people who are here
and the people who've been praying for you all these years
-and so interested in your life. -[Cyntoia, over phone] Yes.
[Bone] I'm not gonna try to tell you the people who are here,
but you can guess.
[Cyntoia] Oh, I love y'all.
-[woman] We love you! -We love you too.
[Cyntoia] You said, as soon as I come to God,
that He was gonna release me. You said it.
It is the culmination of 15 years
of hard work and tears and anguish and joy.
She has everything that she needs, you know, to be successful.
How she uses it...
will be basically up to her.
Where the roads lead, I don't know, but you know what?
I hope they lead to a rainbow for her.
[Cyntoia] I have come such a long way. It's been a very long time.
When I was 16, I did a horrible thing.
And I have carried that with me this whole time.
I understand the things that I've done.
That it was so necessary to change.
Everybody who's been here for me,
I would not be here if it weren't for them.
Through everything that's been shown today,
I'm not gonna let you down.
I have a whole new family, a whole new community
of people who love me, who believe in me, who support me.
There's so many things that I understand now that I didn't know.
There's so many young people that still don't know,
and I feel called to share that.
I don't take that lightly.
You have won my heart.
Why, then, do you still fight me?
I have lost repeatedly to you, my love.
Let it go, my love.
My amour...
My sweetheart...
Let's talk, my love. Please talk, my love.
Let me speak a little. You listen a little.
You chat a little, too... Let me listen.
Why do you sulk, my love?
I try, but you are so stubborn!
This is the time for love. Why are you peeved?
My amour...
My sweetheart...
Let's talk, my love. Please talk, my love.
Do you know how much cigarettes cost nowadays?
Probably less than lung cancer treatment.
This city's pollution will give us cancer anyway.
If not now, then ten years later.
Scold me.
What?
I'm late right? So scold me now,
else you'll look for excuses to vent it out.
I know it. So don't keep me on edge. Scold me and be done with it.
Don't try to be my boss.
I'll do whatever, whenever I want to.
Let's go.
That's a nice dress.
You noticed? Nice, isn't it?
I told Sunita.
Of late, all she does is find fault with me, jealous bitch!
She had a break up, right?
Give her a few weeks, she'll find another idiot to trap.
What do you mean?
Sunita isn't like that.
Her ex-boyfriend was just an asshole.
Whenever he dropped her at the hostel, he'd leer at me, that pig.
When I'd tell Sunita, she'd get mad at me. As if I was enticing him!
Always falls for the wrong guys, that poor girl.
Good for her.
Before she gets bored of the guy, the guy dumps her
Everyone stays happy!
Happy?
That's your problem.
You barely meet someone, and you instantly judge them.
About everything - who they are, what they do...
Poor Sunita.
I know how hard the break-up was on her.
She even attempted suicide twice.
You won't understand!
Some people just love being fucked over.
They're addicted to suffering.
Your dear Sunita is of the same breed.
There's no drama in her life -
The same boring job and salary.
Love. Sex. Fights, Breakups.
That's how she entertains herself.
Mark my words, she'll have at least two marriages,
Mark my words, she'll have at least two marriages, four extramarital affairs and three divorces.
You never find anything good in anyone.
What's good and bad in this?
And when did I claim to be arbiter of absolute truth?
Doesn't everyone judge one another?
I just don't make any bones about it.
If you really think of it, you'll find vices in Aamir Khan (film actor)
If you really think of it, you'll find vices in Aamir Khan (film actor) and virtues in Salman Khan (film actor).
What matters is whose film is a hit.
Also, a film that seems stupid now, could become a future classic
and one that's great now might age terribly.
Earlier, women pursuing education were berated. That's no longer the case.
The future could turn the tables again.
If ideas of good and bad can change with time...
Why must I carry the burden of morality?
Stop preaching. Tell me frankly...
Everyone has something good in them, right?
So tell me what you like about Sunita?
Tell me!
Her voice.
Her voice?
It's so hoarse.
Like Vidya Balan, Priyanka Chopra, Rani Mukherjee...
So did I say she sounds like Lata Mangeshkar,
Shreya Ghoshal or Kavita Krishnamurti?
So?
That's what! When she gets fucked, imagine how hot she sounds!
How many times have I told you not to talk dirty about women?
It's not dirty.
Right. "Not dirty. Just truth!"
Correct.
And not just girls and sex, I speak my mind about anything and everything.
And it'll be a crime if you don't?
Yes!
For work's sake, I've stopped being completely honest with the world.
I'll have to do the same with you, with this attitude of yours.
And if that happens, I'll end up barely talking to you.
Fine. Say whatever you want. I won't say a thing.
No, say it. What's the fun otherwise?
So you hurt me just for fun?
Look. No, actually just listen. And understand this now.
Look. No, actually just listen. And understand this now. You have some delusions about how life is and should be!
You have some delusions about how life is and should be!
If you didn't have them, you wouldn't get hurt.
I don't say anything to intentionally hurt you.
But when you hurt yourself with your stupidity, it delights me.
It's as funny as watching one's own father slip on a banana peel.
Slipping can break one's bones too, you know.
I love you - which is why I tolerate you.
If it was someone else, I'd most likely...
If it wasn't you, even I'd be different, wouldn't I?
Where are we going?
What road are we travelling? What road are we travelling?
Tell me.
You really don't know? No.
I had messaged you.
I told you I'm facing issues with WhatsApp!
Even my boss's message about the meeting reached me this morning.
I had to run out without breakfast.
And they don't let us check our phones in office.
That's good.
Smartphones are only making people more stupid.
Don't you also use a smartphone?
I have business with stupid people.
Why should I sacrifice my business for my beliefs?
Just tell me where we are going!
Tell me this, if you didn't know where we're headed, why didn't you ask before?
How does it matter... as long as you're with me, love!
And yet you did ask.
It's pointless speaking to you.
We're going to Gulshan Café.
I haven't eaten a thing since morning either.
Why, love?
Some clients had come to meet Malvani.
Who Malvani? The CA?
Didn't you guys fight the last time?
Yes, we did.
Then?
He's also a hardcore CA.
And from a community known for shrewdness.
He knew I was in a tight spot.
His dumb ass-licking employees are good for nothing.
He had no option but to hire me to convert his client's black money into white.
You'll get a fat commission now, right?
Fat my ass! Whatever I earn, half will go into paying loans.
The rest must be saved until the next job.
You were the one crazy about stocks and Bitcoin! Betting your money online.
Didn't I warn you against gambling?
Must be fun telling me, "I told you so!" "I told you so!"
You think I'm happy that you lost money?
Because I act smart in front of you,
must be fun to see me fail.
Anyway,
no use crying over spilled milk.
This country's economy is fucked anyway.
Big businessmen are taking money from banks and fleeing the country...
Or just saving their asses by bribing the government.
Till election funding is sorted out, no party will touch these guys.
News Channels have also become pimps for these parties.
And these stupid voters will elect the same guys who have fucked them in the ass.
Honesty and hard work won't earn enough money.
That's why I invested in the share market and Bitcoin. That didn't work.
Next time, I'll invest again. Someday, I'll hit the jackpot.
Till then, you can scoff at me.
Okay fine. I'm sorry.
At least, today you made money, right? Let's celebrate then.
So should I order you a chariot?
Isn't that why we are going to Café Gulshan!
These cabbies have become arrogant assholes! None will stop.
Listen,
Today I'll pay at the hotel.
For what joy?
It'll be half and half like always.
Let it go. Today's a reason to celebrate.
That reason is mine. Not yours!
Why do you talk like that?
Don't hurt me so much that my heart breaks one day.
If your heart is so weak, it is better if it breaks.
There's no place for the weak in this world
I'm not weak.
You make me weak.
Blaming others for one's own weakness is the first sign of a weak person, my dear.
Whether you read the Gita or the Quran.
If you take refuge in love to hide your frailties, you've already lost.
I don't want your weakness to affect me. Come on.
Can you never speak nicely to me?
Do you never get bored asking the same question?
If I am so boring, then you should leave me.
Sorry.
I really am.
I'm not saying you're boring.
It's just this habit of yours.
What are you doing in front of people?
Are they your relatives?
What can they do anyway?
There is something called public decency, mister.
See the videos in the secret folders on people's phones.
See the videos in the secret folders on people's phones. You'll see how decent they are.
That reminds me, let's shoot it on the phone today.
What did I tell you last time?
You said no.
And why did I say no?
What if the phone gets stolen, lost or hacked?
Yes. So, what has changed since then?
Nothing.
You still don't trust me.
Where does trust come into this?
Exactly, there is no trust.
You always find ways to twist my words.
You're too smart, eh?
Knowing you'd lose the argument, you just changed the topic.
Losing, winning...
Love isn't a contest!
-Is it not? -No.
Are you so dumb?
Wait a sec.
I just called you smart,
but now I'm wondering if you're a smartass or a dumb fuck.
Don't abuse me.
You love me but you can't handle my cussing? Is your love that sanitized?
Now who's changing the topic?
Why do you treat love like a contest?
Just me?
Everyone treats it that way.
There's no equality in love.
One partner always dominates the other.
Sometimes blatantly, sometimes by emotional manipulation.
And the best part is, no one learns this.
It just happens. Automatically.
Those romantic songs, films, books...
Inspirational videos on WhatsApp and Facebook...
Telling us how nice love is, or how cute life is...
They just want to hide one truth.
What truth?
That all love is selfish. People love only if there's something to gain.
Without profit, love can't exist. And if it does, it doesn't last.
Profit?
Yeah, like the joy of small emotional victories over the other.
So you think I love you for selfish reasons?
Aren't you human?
What do I have to gain, tell me?
Half the time you're crying, or else you fight.
Maybe you enjoy suffering like Sunita.
Maybe that's how you profit from love.
The day you stop enjoying being sad with me, you'd leave me.
Just how a stockbroker leaves the share market.
This accounting job of yours has made you see everything as profit and loss!
And you're Mother Teresa's heir, right?
I don't think we'll get a taxi. Let's take the train.
Cool.
Nah. We take the train every day.
Today we'll take a cab or walk.
Okay.
Listen. Yeah.
Chuck it.
Say!
Nah. Nothing.
Of course there's something.
Tell me. Don't build it up.
I'll tell you later.
Why not now?
Can't we talk about this later at leisure?
In any case, you'll be calmer after you eat.
See, that's accounting, got it?
First, you evaluated my state of mind...
And calculated that emotional investment can be made later.
Better chances of returns!
Thank you my dear, for proving my point.
That's... that's not what I had meant...
The taxi's here.
So, what do I do now?
You are already late in filing it.
Can't you forge a simple balance sheet?
Why the fuck did you all become CA, you dumb fucks!
Sort out your mess, and don't bother me. Hang up now!
What's this boring song, bro! Change the channel or turn it off.
It's not playing for you, mister - it's for me.
But the customer has a problem with it.
So what do I do? Am I a doctor, to fix your problems?
The customer is God. Never heard of it?
Then use your Godly powers- stop the music and make my cab run without petrol!
I like this guy. Too bad, he'll never go far in life!
Bro, focus on your girlfriend. What I do with my life is up to me. Got it?
What's your name, buddy?
Joginder. Want to dial customer care and complain?
No. In fact, you're worthy of praise.
And why would you praise me?
In this world of ass-lickers, there aren't many like you left.
I'm like you too. Our honesty won't get us far in life.
It's not like that, brother. I was almost set for life.
I voted for the BJP.
Actually, I voted for Narendra Modi. For 'Development'.
I had hoped inflation would decrease.
Petrol prices would drop.
Food would get cheaper. I'd save and buy my own cab.
I own a piece of land in the village. Had planned to set up my own flour mill.
Nothing happened.
The promise of development turned out to be a farce. Nothing more.
Then vote for the Congress party?
What on earth are you saying?
Voting for the Congress means voting for that Gandhi boy.
He's still in his mother's lap... how can he manage the country?
Then what about Kejriwal?
Kejriwal is an idiot. He can barely handle Delhi,
you think he can manage the country?
Then go for the Leftists.
Those with red flags are left with red asses now. They can't do shit.
Then who will you vote for?
I won't vote for anyone now. I have lost faith.
Speaking of which, who would you vote for? Which party do you support?
I don't even believe in marriage.
What does that even mean?
I didn't get you.
Every five years, the country is married to a government. After five years,
If it works, great - else there's a divorce
Till then, we are bound to be sodomized.
No matter, who wins the election, it's the public that always loses.
That's true.
Are you dating him or me?
What happened?
Talk to me. I don't get politics.
I know that.
You've never even voted, right?
What's the point of voting? Didn't you hear what he said?
True madam. Voting changes nothing. We make our own lives.
Got it?
A stranger who sees not just your thoughts before me,
But also your feelings!
You guys think so alike. Bro,
you sit here at the back. I'll drive.
You just can't control your tongue. That can't happen, Sir. I have my wife back in the village.
That can't happen, Sir. I have my wife back in the village.
We have a little daughter too.
That's nice! Do you visit them often?
No Madam. No point in visiting the village.
When she's free, I send her tickets and she comes here for 3-4 months.
There is nothing but heat and dust back there.
How can you say that? There's so much peace in villages.
It's the cities that are the hotbed of stress.
Madam, looks like you're city-born.
Yes. How did you know?
Because it's too obvious!
This romantic idea of yours... That the village is idyllic, peaceful...
He figured you've never been to a real village.
What's romantic about what I said?
Farmers are dying. There's no water.
Forget serious illnesses,
there's no doctor to treat fever for miles around in most villages.
And even if you find one, you can't be sure if he's not a fake. Wanna hear more?
No. Why should I? Are you a journalist?
If only they did their jobs with integrity.
You can only complain.
Then go! Leave your measly job and move to a village.
I can.
It's not like villages haven't progressed.
So much has changed. There's internet, TV, mobile phones.
So the things that cause stress in the city, you want them in a village as well!
You ought to be worshipped.
You're a saint. You deserve to live there.
Why should I go,
Why should I go, without you by my side?
Because you'd be hot property in a village,
many boys will fall for you.
In a city, no matter how much make-up you put, you'll look like trash.
Go to hell.
You think you look like a stud? Look at a mirror once!
Whatever. I am the hero of my own film.
A flop film.
As if yours is a blockbuster.
Please stop the car. At the corner ahead. Can't stop it here Ma'am. Just a bit ahead.
Can't stop it here Ma'am. Just a bit ahead.
Are you pissed?
Are you?
Yes. So what?
Watch ahead! Driving like a buffoon.
She gets charged up when she's angry. Like a wild cat.
So the dog in me is bound to get excited, right?
Take it easy, man!
He won't stop till he cuts it down
It's not a big deal, Sir.
What you did.
You didn't have a problem?
No sir. Not at all.
We did the same thing in a taxi the last time as well.
We did the same thing in a taxi the last time as well. The driver got very angry. Said we had polluted his car.
He was an old grouch.
Lectured us on how today's vile youth are fucking up the country.
These old farts are just jealous. They keep shoving their wisdom up our asses.
Cowards, all of them.
Even my father was like that.
And his father too.
But what you did Sir, it's not a big deal.
Let me tell you a secret.
When I stop driving after 11 at night, I rent the taxi out to gay couples.
They have their fun and we earn some money.
Is it good money?
What good money? Have to share it with the cops as well.
The police know about this?
This is Mumbai. Nothing happens here without police permission.
And these days, even the self-appointed moral police have joined in.
Motherfuckers. They'd probably fuck you up.
They would? They already have fucked us up, Sir.
They would? They already have fucked us up, Sir. Let me tell you something. Come here...
Let me tell you something. Come here...
I have a friend who also drives a cab in Versova.
Right.
Last week, in Versova, he gave his taxi to two girls.
Last week, in Versova, he gave his taxi to two girls. And the moral policing goons turned up all armed.
And the moral policing goons turned up all armed.
He asked them to take some money and let them go.
But they were in no mood to listen.
This guy seems to be in a rush.
Put a siren on the car and buzz off!
So the goons beat him up, pulled the girls out....raped them,
made a video and then put it on a porn site.
They didn't know that one of the girls was a rich man's daughter.
She left a note and committed suicide.
The next day, the police and the cultural goons were caught...
And our special night service was shut down.
Good only.
I can't believe your story.
If that girl was a rich kid, then she could've gone to a five star hotel!
Why would she pick up your special taxi service?
Madam, the thing is... Let it go. Sir will mind.
No, go on.
Why would I mind, it's not like we're married.
Ma'am, these rich people have a poverty fetish.
Just like... That Salman Khan film- what was it called?
Bajrangi.
Such a shitty film. Not that one. There was another.
Sultan?
That was even shittier. The recent one...
Yes, 'Kick'! They get a kick out of it.
Rich people get a kick out of getting down and dirty.
Now what happened?
What do you mean, 'not that we're married'?
Since we're not married... What would you do if a man tried molesting me?
Haven't thought about it. We'll see when it happens.
No. tell me now. What would you do if a man tried molesting me?
What would I do?
Thrash him, what else?
Thank God.
I thought you didn't love me.
How is that related to love?
Not just you, I'd do it for any girl.
So it's not about loving me...
Only because that you think it's wrong?
There is nothing wrong or right.
People can digest certain things or not.
What one can digest one does. What one can't, one doesn't.
Be it food, drinks, crime or corruption.
Forget this discourse on digestion. The point is, do you love me or not?
Well, as Shah Rukh said in Mohabbatein...
Don't love someone expecting to be loved back.
Unrequited love- the same thing was in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.
You even cried during the film. Then why are you contradicting yourself now?
So that means you don't love me.
You believe what you want.
You know I can't stand this lovey-dovey talk.
If you irritate me more, I'll leave you here and go. Should I?
We've reached Café Gulshan.
How much?
70 rupees. Do give change.
Wait a sec. Let me park by the side.
Do you have change?
If you ask for your phone, I'll leave now.
My WhatsApp just started working. Just 2 minutes, please?
Mom had gone to a cousin's wedding.
You won't believe the ruckus that happened there.
Please give it back?
She's telling me what happened to the groom's family after the police arrived!
Please, love?
Get the bill. No, No! Wait, wait!
Sorry. I'll talk to mom later.
Why do you get mad so quick?
First say what you were waiting to tell me here.
What do I do with this?
It's a present.
For what joy?
It's our first anniversary, dumbo!
So?
So? Isn't it a happy occasion?
It'll be two years the next year.
Will you give me a bike then?
And a car after three years?
I'll gift you a child after marriage.
So that's what you wanted to say.
Why pretend with this gift?
You aren't pretending to love me, right?
Tell me, will you marry me?
No idea. What's the hurry?
Hurry?
I'm 30, love.
Need to have a child in 2 years.
Mom pesters me a lot these days.
Should we get married to pacify your mom or to legally have a child?
Decide this first.
That's not what I meant.
But don't tell me you've never thought of marriage .
I have. Absolutely.
In fact, I had decided before we started dating.
Well?
Like always, I decided to take it as it comes.
So when will you be sure about me? I mean, about us?
How am I supposed to know?
Don't say that, love.
I feel very insecure thinking that you'll leave me for another girl.
That's also possible.
Just like you may leave me for another man...
One who's ready to marry you right away.
I will never leave you.
I haven't left you yet either.
Then what's the hurry to get married?
Am I wrong to think this?
Not wrong. Just childish.
Suppose we get married tomorrow.
What's the guarantee that I won't fall for another woman after marriage?
And then divorce you and settle with her?
Anyway, a woman doesn't remain the same after childbirth.
The body begins to wear out.
Where will you roam around with a kid?
You won't do that.
Why?
Because no matter what you say, you're honest at heart.
You aren't deceitful. I know that.
So?
Honest people never deceive others.
How is that relevant?
For example, like I find you exciting today...
I may find another woman exciting tomorrow.
I won't cheat on you.
I'll tell you frankly that I have fallen for someone else.
If that woman likes me back, then I'll leave you.
Now, how is that cheating?
No. You won't do anything like this.
Marriage changes people.
The ones who change are scared of society.
I don't give a fuck about society when it comes to my personal life
Sure, I might change a bit, for a year or two, to try out this routine dull life.
But you'd get bored of me once that happens
I will never get bored of you.
Because I am like this, right?
I will become like the rest after marriage.
Then you will miss my pre-marriage avatar.
You will get bored for sure. No.
All these made-in-heaven celebrity couples, even they must be bored of each other.
So couples who stay together till death, do so pointlessly?
Even a farmer stays with his fields, all till he dies... Even if he goes bankrupt, if he hasn't committed suicide already.
Even if he goes bankrupt, if he hasn't committed suicide already.
Because he doesn't have an option.
And if he does, then he doesn't have the balls to act on it.
I agree marriages have issues. They all do, love.
But after a certain age, it matters to have someone waiting for you at home.
Of course it matters.
But only for people like you who can't live without depending on others.
I am a modern independent woman.
Financially, yes.
But not at heart,
and definitely not at mind.
Only because I want to get married?
You talk about taking risks...
Why not take the risk of marrying me?
Come here! Listen.
What is a risk?
A risk is where there is no security.
And marriage literally means security.
So how is marriage a risk?
It's always the same issues, clashes over money and ego.
clashes over money and ego.
The same futile fights like the ones in films and TV.
Families will interfere.
Raising kids will keep you entertained,
but what about me?
I'll end up philandering, and even our sex-life will become mechanical.
If you find some fresh sausage, even you'll salivate.
Whether one is honest or not,
either way tensions are bound to rise.
Then fights. Divorce.
A phone barely lasts two years...
And you dream of lifelong companionship?
Our parents' marriages lasted, right?
Of course.
But that time was different.
And even they probably had their affairs.
Who knows where our fathers' dicks went, and for whom our mothers' cunts opened up?
Those were different times. Times of hiding things.
Times of token respect for parents, family and the nation.
And if our parents were so righteous and wise...
Then why are we so fucked today?
Because they were hollow.
If our parents were truly cultured and sensible...
We wouldn't have been like this.
Sweetheart,
you want adventure and security...
Romance and reality - all at once.
You can revel in hypocrisy, not me.
Fine, I won't get anything for you.
I've understood.
You're just killing time with me.
Not serious at all.
What's the point of getting serious?
Tell me.
We live a maximum of 60 years...
First 20 studying and the last 15 in regrets.
That leaves only 25 years in hand.
8 years go in completing 8 hours of daily sleep.
That leaves 17 years.
2 years go in eating and shitting.
So, in the remaining 15 years, enjoy as much as you can.
Change as many jobs, partners, principles, castes, religions
Change as many jobs, partners, principles, castes, religions and countries as you can.
Why tie yourself to one thing?
That's easy for you to say.
You're a man.
So?
We're born men or women by accident.
Women can also do all this, can't they?
If you just want a child, there are many ways to have one.
Read up on the internet.
Why do you need marriage for that?
All this sounds great, but tomorrow if your wife elopes with someone else, you'd feel like shit!
but tomorrow if your wife elopes with someone else, you'd feel like shit!
Look silly.
I've already told you, nothing is good or bad.
It's all about how much someone can stomach.
I can digest all this. You can't. That's the difference.
If I'm not trying to change your mindset, then why are you imposing yours on me?
At first I thought you were joking.
But forget marriage, I doubt you even love me.
I do love you.
Which is why I am here. Now. Today. This moment. I've been with you for a year.
But I can't speak for tomorrow.
And I won't make the mistake of marrying - you or anyone else.
What if you do?
So what? You just said I'm not serious.
I may end up marrying you or someone at a whim.
If I get bored, I might get a divorce.
Life is a comedy, if you can catch the joke.
I'll leave after eating. I'm breaking up with you.
Full and final. I'm done with you.
You know I can't stand chit-chat while eating.
Especially when it's such nice food, after
I am not chatting. I'm telling you. We're done.
So tell me,
what will you do after the break-up?
Who's chatting now?
It's my rule.
I'll break it when I want. What do you care?
You're hurt, aren't you?
Now you realize how I feel when you...
I am hurt.
But don't you worry.
Like my backache gets fine after a week,
so will my heartache.
After a point, I can't take all this.
I'll send you an invite.
You'll get married after we break up?
Yes.
With whom?
With whoever. What do you care?
I've spent so much time with you, don't I deserve to know?
I'll find someone from a matrimonial website.
Else, all the guys I've been rejecting for an asshole like you,
I'll marry one of them.
Go ahead.
You'll find some loser.
There are loads in this country.
You are a loser. My husband won't be.
Hundred percent he will be one. How do you know? Did you conceive him?
I know it.
Because you are a loser.
Neither are you pretty, nor do you have a hot body.
You don't have money nor an illustrious family.
You aren't funny or interesting.
You're 30, but you look 35.
That famous line from the movie Krantiveer describes your life perfectly-
"I don't know what I lived or died for!"
Did you get it?
And what are you?
A king?
You still stay in a rented place with two other guys.
You have brains but zero success.
No girl has survived you beyond a month,
except me.
Your family doesn't even want to see you.
You'll die like a lonely prick.
Even those who come to your funeral shall spit on your grave.
Exactly. Perfect analysis.
That's why we're made for each other.
Break up if you want, but you won't find another like me. You'll see.
You...
you are depressed.
I don't want to be depressed with you.
Depressed...
Me?
Aren't you?
The government is rotten. The media is a sellout. Your parents are idiots.
Friends are selfish.
The guys you work with are either corrupt or cowards.
Films are boring and your girlfriend is a loser.
If you have problems with everything,
why don't you just kill yourself?
What?
Suicide. Do it.
Sweetheart, depressed are those whose hopes have been fucked.
I have no hope,
and hence, no disappointments.
No fear. That's why I have freedom.
And why should I commit suicide?
I love life.
The world and its people are crooked, but I love fighting them.
Actually, you are jealous of my freedom.
You want to be like me, but you can't.
Isn't that why you want to trap me with marriage and children?
So that I also become spineless like you!
So after marriage,
you can fuck my mind the way I fuck yours now?
Let me eat in peace.
Stop it! Let me watch the movie.
You need your eyes and ears for that.
Leave the rest for me to fuck.
You said the same thing last time.
Shake it. Rub it. Suck it. Ride it.
I know all your tricks.
I won't allow anything. Let me watch the movie.
What crap! How can you watch this stupid movie.
What stupid? It's a nice movie.
Such movies educate the public.
On how to respect the country and women.
You especially must watch it.
If 5000 years of culture couldn't educate the public,
what difference will this 2 hour movie make?
I'm not that educated,
but I know people must be reminded constantly about what's good and bad.
Else wouldn't it be easier for powerful assholes to mislead them?
Wow.
You are getting smarter.
Are you praising me or...
Only the innocent get misled.
And people today are far from innocent.
They were at one time, but not anymore.
You think people don't know what's good or bad?
Everyone knows everything.
They don't need education for that. They just know.
Yet they vote for scum, this innocent public of yours.
They take dowry.
Abort girl children.
Either they commit corruption or comply silently.
So long as their own house is not on fire, they let others' burn.
Arguing over which party to side with,
this stupid public has forgotten to take its own side.
I often wonder what the soldiers on the border think.
We sleep peacefully because of them.
Can they sleep peacefully knowing what's happening in the country they're protecting?
You used to write poems in college, right?
Did plays as well?
There's still time, you should quit accounting and write dialogues for movies.
Dialogues for movies?
Yes! Your mind will find an outlet.
Our cinema is as spineless as our people.
Have you ever heard the name of any political party in a movie?
The characters inhabit a space where nothing is real-whether it's politics,
The characters inhabit a space where nothing is real-whether it's politics, sex or society.
It's all superficial.
Home-made sex videos are more authentic than this.
These cowards have got the audience addicted to this delusion.
It's like opium, both the peddlers and buyers are in a stupor.
Why don't you write for art films instead?
Look at me.
Have you ever seen an art film?
Yes, I have.
They are all art.
But no heart.
Social sensitivity...
Tailor-made for white-collar people.
Well-ironed.
These popcorn flicks we watch waste enough of my hard-earned money.
Even if I write something, the Censors won't pass it.
And if it does pass,
it'll offend so many people that it would flop.
Yes. I read about the movie 'Padmaavat'.
Mom says intolerance has increased under the BJP government.
It's probably best you don't write movies.
You'll write about Modi or the BJP.
Or the RSS.
You're better being an accountant.
The current climate is dangerous for freedom of expression.
The current climate?
Things have never been ideal nor will they be in a 100 years.
The Congress blames the BJP and RSS for curbing Freedom of Expression.
Will the Congress tolerate movies
Will the Congress tolerate movies or serials criticizing the Nehru-Gandhi family?
or serials criticizing the Nehru-Gandhi family?
Do they have guts?
Everyone wants to censor.
Politicians, news media, industrialists, the judiciary.
Whoever comes to power will do this.
Enough.
Let me enjoy the movie.
You enjoy the movie,
let me enjoy you. What's the problem!
Look, the song has started. Suck me off till then please.
I'll tell you when the song is over.
You can watch it on YouTube later.
I can see the whole movie on the internet.
I want to watch it here!
Will you suck or should I leave?
Then you can watch it in peace.
Your cunt creamed in the cab.
What about me?
My dick is still waiting.
Should I wait till eternity now? You won't let me watch the movie in peace, right?
I will. Why wouldn't I?
But pacify my cock first.
Yeah, start now.
How long will we go on like this?
Like what?
The way things are.
Now don't bore me with the same things again.
Then what do I talk to you about?
Either you fight
or have sex
or give depressing sermons.
Would it hurt to talk lovingly for once...
This is how I love, silly.
You won't get it.
I get it.
You're a coward.
You run away before you can get hurt by anything.
Look at me.
Despite all my hardships,
I still have the courage to face more.
You are envious of my courage, right?
Both envious and attracted.
You won't be able to handle a girl like yourself, right?
You are right.
We should break up.
What's this all of a sudden?
It's not sudden. It's how it is.
What's simmering in our subconscious suddenly hits us.
Didn't you also want to break up back at the hotel?
I've spoken of it many times. But so have you.
I know.
But it never hit me.
I don't know about you, but it didn't hit me.
When you were talking at the hotel, I heard you but didn't absorb your words.
Now I have.
Let's break up.
This will probably be the first amicable one.
Let it go, love.
I never meant it.
I know you're very stressed these days.
That's my default mode.
I get high on stress.
Even if I land in heaven, I will fuck things up to create stress for everyone.
But that's not the point. My point is that
our relationship has reached its expiry date.
One should throw away an expired product before it fucks you up.
What product?
Come. Get up. Drop me till the hostel.
Let's drop the subject.
I don't want to justify breaking up.
It must be done. That's it!
Anyway...
There's this girl at the bank.
What did you say?
The bank near my house.
There is a girl there.
Cashier.
She's average-looking.
Doesn't talk much.
Quite innocent.
But her eyes ooze with lust,
even if she tries to hide it.
Plus, she has round and tight breasts.
She's slim.
When her boobs swing wildly as she rides my cock,
it'll be heaven, I swear.
She's skinny, so she can bounce on my cock for at least half an hour.
Perfect girl to date for six months.
She seems conservative.
But once I get her in bed,
I'd fuck her brains out.
She'll keep coming back for more even after she gets married.
Have you gone nuts?
What shit you are saying?
Basically, I want to invest my time on the bank girl.
So I'll be unable to give you much time. No option.
We have to break up.
No option.
Don't stretch the joke.
Where did this girl come from suddenly?
At least, find a good excuse to break up.
Not suddenly.
She's been giving me signals for a month now.
And I've been reciprocating too.
If you don't believe me,
I'll call you when I fuck her for the first time.
If she allows, you can shoot us.
And if you want, join in after setting up the camera.
You're bullshitting.
I know it.
Actually,
come with me to the bank tomorrow.
I am your third boyfriend since school, right?
And one of them was a foolish married teacher who got fired thanks to you.
You're low on looks but high on experience.
When you see her talking to me, you'll see where it's heading.
So what if I had three boyfriends!
Would you know if I hadn't told you?
Do you think I'm a slut?
Is that why you're leaving me?
You think like a typical man or woman.
Even I've had girlfriends,
Does that make me a man-slut?
See, the thing is...
Either a man leaves a woman
or she leaves him.
Lucky are the lovers who part mutually.
Anyway, we are both are unlucky in general.
Why leave this lucky chance to break up mutually?
Agreed?
What wrong have I done?
No matter what you do and how you treat me...
I love you.
Look...
Look...
I won't fight with you today onwards.
I won't cry either.
Marriage can wait too.
And if you don't want it, then we won't.
And if you want to leave me after marriage, you can.
But don't leave me now for another girl, please.
I beg you.
It's only you,
who really talks to me.
You curse me,
but
at least I know you care.
Listen, do one thing.
You..
You... you'll leave that girl once you're done with her, right?
I'm okay with that.
I'll accept her as your mistress for six months.
Even if you can't meet me while dating her,
I'll bear with it.
Just speak to me on the phone for an hour every day, please.
I am tired of living like this.
If you leave me like this,
I'll do something.
You'll commit suicide?
If you leave me, I will.
What will that achieve?
You want me to die?
First answer me, what will suicide achieve?
I don't want to live without you.
I know that.
But tell me, what will suicide achieve?
You will feel bad.
So?
So you won't live happily.
As if I am jumping with joy now!
One more sorrow will add up. What difference would it make?
How would I know?
I'd be dead.
What would you do after death?
Do you believe in the afterlife?
There must be something.
Heaven or hell.
You're sure it exists?
You're sure it doesn't?
If it does,
you'd still be a tortured soul like you are now.
Yes. What are you trying to say?
Nothing.
Just fucking with you.
It's fun seeing you all worked up.
You're an asshole.
Tell me something new.
Please don't break up with me.
Fine, I won't.
And that girl?
Which girl?
Bastard, you were lying to me?
We all need some drama in life.
This is how you create it.
Our life is not like a movie
or like a bank scam, always rife with drama.
What difference does it make?
And even if it does, who cares?
I don't know what you're saying.
Neither do I.
And even if I did, so what?
I'll go back to the hostel now.
Sunita will be back.
Have to listen to her sob story as well.
And we have to cook chicken for the hostel folks as well.
Let Sunita go to hell. You stay here.
No way.
I've had enough of your bile for a day.
What's your scene tomorrow?
Office.
On a Sunday?
Yes. We have two months of backlog to clear.
Didn't you all clear that last week?
Yes. We did. But my boss said that...
Actually I'm not sure.
He has called me, Amit, Sudhir and Nisha.
And Sudhir's mom is having that kidney dial... what is it called?
Dialysis. Yes. That.
He's still called Sudhir to work.
So when will you get free tomorrow?
Don't know.
Then let's go.
Where?
To fuck.
Please tell me.
Told you, to fuck.
What?
I'll have to look at porn and jack off tomorrow anyway.
Since you are here right now, come.
We just did it in the theatre.
That was furtive and anxious. Don't fuck my brains now.
Just come.
You can't think of anything besides pussy, cock and ass. Can you?
We only meet properly on Saturdays and Sundays, correct?
If you're on your period, then it's a no-go.
And on holidays, you meet your mother.
Now I get this time-table, but my cock doesn't. When will you get that?
The other stuff I think about, you don't get it anyway.
So why waste time talking about anything else?
Even when you're talking about politics and society
it's all about cock, ass and fucking.
What's the difference?
First time you've cracked a good joke!
I'm not as dumb as you think.
Then come! Show off your smartness at the lodge.
Fine. I give up.
Are you doing me a favor? Or am I begging you?
If you have the energy to fuck then come,
else I can always hire cheap whores nearby to lick my ass like in porn videos.
Don't call me a whore, motherfucker!
Don't call me a whore, motherfucker! I crave this angry cat-like energy of yours!
I hate fucking dead fish, anyway
First apologize for calling me a whore.
Sorry. Come on.
I am sorry. Forgive me.
Fine, I am your whore, you're my customer and God's the pimp who made us meet.
Happy now?
I have to go with friends at night to smoke weed.
Why don't you stop smoking weed.
Only makes your volatile mood swings worse.
I can leave you at the hostel, sweetheart... but not weed.
Fuck.
What's wrong?
I shouldn't have brought up the topic of weed.
Why? What happened?
Nothing's happened...
but it will.
Please don't do it, love.
Please don't!
I'm not comfortable.
Listen!
Listen!
What?
You're not comfortable?
Drink this.
No.
No.... Have it... You'll get comfortable.
Don't do it. See...
Ah, now I can see.
Your boobs are sagging
Why don't you get breast firming serum?
Or massage oil after bath and before sleeping.
Look at me, talking like an idiot instead of fucking.
Look...
Today I want to fuck your ass...I'll do the rest later.
Will you take off your panties or should I?
I'll do whatever you want.
But please switch off the mobile.
I'll delete it later.
Pull the undies down.
Mine first.
Do I need to tell you everything?
You haven't shaved your pussy?
It hurts. Please do it slowly.
Have you lost it! I am leaving.
Don't leave. Don't leave me.
I... I was trying to imitate porn.
I won't bite anymore.
Did it hurt a lot?
What are you doing, love?
Have you gone nuts?
You never hit me.
So, I thought I'll hit myself.
I've told you so many times, not to smoke weed.
Why then?
I won't smoke after this. Promise.
Promise?
I swear on my dick.
Bastard.
What are you looking for?
Please tell.
Got it.
What's this for?
Your pussy must be in pain,
so I'll apply this.
You'll feel better.
Okay? Come. Lie down.
You'd planned to bite me from before?
No, why?
Then why did you carry Vaseline in your bag?
Oh... this?
Because today I had intended to fuck you from behind!
Your pussy's always loose.
Dry too.
And
spit dries up quickly in your pussy
It'd be no good in the ass.
That's why I got Vaseline.
No. You've bitten me way too hard.
I won't allow you from behind today.
Today?
When did you let me fuck from behind before?
I mean .... I mean, not today.
Some other day.
Today you have to let me.
Get fucked every moment, this very moment....
Don't joke.
At least let me fuck your ass.
What's wrong?
Okay.
Let's do our regular thing. Fine?
Turn off the cellphone first.
Let it record at least.
Then you can delete it yourself.
How can I trust you? What if you go back on your word later?
It's been recording till now.
A bit more won't matter.
Satisfied?
Can I continue now?
I thought that... you don't mind me deleting it?
No.
I had anyway thought I would...
let it go. No. Tell me what you were thinking.
Take it deeper, my queen.
It needs to be longer to go deeper, my king. Right?
Continue. Continue.
If you're tired of my dick, lick my balls as well.
And when you're tired of that, lick my asshole too.
Don't stop.
You ask me to shave.
Ever seen your own hair in the mirror?
Open your mouth for just one thing, darling.
Keep licking.
I'll puke, I am warning you.
We just took a shower half an hour back.
Don't worry. My asshole's clean as a whistle.
Please...
Now go on sucking. Should I beg you?
Time's passing by.
Breathe deeper.
Put in your tongue. There.
Twirl your tongue.
Twirl it.
Bite if you want to.
Come up here... come. Fuck me harder, love!
Let your cock tear my pussy apart.
Fuck me, love.
Don't stop!
Harder, harder...
Rape that hole
Rape me!
It hurts, love...
Make me wet, make me bleed!
It hurts so much...
But I love the pain!
I'm going crazy...
Don't stop. Don't Stop. Don't Stop.
Please... please don't, it hurts a lot.
Didn't you promise not to hurt me?
The last time you had an abortion, it can't hurt more than that right?
You can take this much pain.
Please don't do it, darling.
I was giving you pleasure till now, wasn't I?
Pleasure?
From you?
Every time I fuck you I imagine someone else's face, got it!
These days I can't even do that.
Your rotten face is stuck in my head.
Bitch, giving me pleasure?
Can't bear to see your face while fucking, that's why I wanted to fuck your ass.
Hide the face and fuck the base- that's all you're good for.
Do you know that?
No one will even touch you, if they're not high.
You want me to rape you?
You'd puke if you lick my asshole?
Even kissing you can make one puke, bitch.
Quit these tantrums and give me your ass. It'll be fine. Come on.
How do you know it'll be fine?
Motherfucker, how do you know?
Did you put someone else's cock in your ass, when you couldn't get a girl to fuck?
You tiny-dicked eunuch! You're just a piece of shit!
Now tell me.
Am I shit?
Speak up.
Speak now.
You wanted to be raped, right? Take this.
Who knows how many have torn your cunt till date!
You're trying to teach me? Bitch!
I'm not a bad guy.
Say something, please.
Please!
Laugh.
What?
Laugh.
Laugh loudly.
Can you?
Loudly.
Louder.
Keep laughing.
I'll send it to you.
Will you marry me?
I thought about it a lot.
I'll never find someone who loves me this much.
Let's get married.
Then whatever happens, we'll see.
I've seen it already.
This won't happen again.
I promise you.
I can't do this again either.
I've promised myself.
Look.
This is real life. Not a movie.
Don't throw dialogues at me.
Well, here's one more.
Movies or life -
both end eventually.
So has this.
Please!
Don't leave me like this.
I'll die without you.
What difference does it make?
So are you about me!
A lot.
Even if it does, who cares, silly!
I am crazy about you.
So are you about me!
My kind of love, you have never known.
Our hearts are taking a path less walked!
Tell me, oh love, where should I go?
I am crazy about you.
So are you about me!
My kind of love, you have never known.
Our hearts are taking a path less walked!
Tell me, oh love, where should I go?
Heart, heart, heart, this crazy heart of mine.
Don't misunderstand this craziness of mine.
What kind of chaos is this?
Heart, heart, heart, this crazy heart of mine.
Don't misunderstand this craziness of mine.
What kind of chaos is this?
I am crazy about you.
So are you about me!
My kind of love, you have never known.
Our hearts are taking a path less walked!
Tell me, oh love, where should I go?
I am crazy about you.
So are you about me!

I am crazy about you.
So are you about me!
My kind of love, you have never known.
Our hearts are taking a path less walked!
Tell me, oh love, where should I go?
My love is stubborn, yet naive.
You just don't get it.
Let the world be jealous, people be jealous.
Dear, why do you despair?
My love is stubborn, yet naive.
You just don't get it.
Let the world be jealous, people be jealous.
Dear, why do you despair?
I am crazy about you.

So are you about me!
I am crazy about you.
So are you about me!
Tell me, oh love, where should I go?
-Period? -Yes.
Say it!
I know what it is, but I feel embarrassed.
-You feel shy? -I can't say it.
Okay, but why did you get so serious?
What is she asking? Why does it happen? What happens in the body?
She is asking why it happens.
What is the reason behind the bleeding?
This is something only God knows.
It's bad blood which comes out.
Babies are born because of it.
That's all I know.
Which one of you knows what a period is?
Heard of it?
-Like a class period? -The kind you'd ring a bell for?
No.
Have you heard of menstruation?
Yes, I've heard of it. It's a kind of illness, right?
Illness?
Yes, I've heard that it's an illness. It mostly affects ladies.
Girls, you can at least raise your hands.
Say it.
Say.
I studied until I reached middle school,
but when I started having periods, it became really challenging.
The problem was that, when I got my period, it was very tough for me to change clothes.
I had to go somewhere far off to change.
The cloth I was using became so wet,
I had to keep going out of my way to change it.
Then some men would hover around.
They kept looking at me, so I couldn't change in front of them.
I tried for one year after my period started,
hoping that something would change. When nothing changed...
then I dropped out.
We don't come to the temple during our periods.
We don't pray to any of the gods during our periods.
The elders in the house say that the prayer isn't heard,
no matter how much you pray.
It's me versus the entire village.
How can I manage alone?
They think, "She's mad! What's going through her mind?"
I mostly observed that girls don't have much freedom,
especially after their marriage.
We aren't encouraged to work or become independent.
That doesn't exist for us.
I want to get into the police force.
Why do you want to get into the police force?
To save me from marriage.
Because the goddess we pray to,
she's also a woman, just like us.
So, I don't agree with this rule
that woman should not enter the temple during menstruation
because they are believed to be dirty.
I don't think it's right.
I just find them at home.
They're just old cotton suits I don't use anymore.
In the evening, when no one's around,
I take the chance to throw it away.
Ruby and Jackie dig them out sometimes.
Out on the street.
It's very embarrassing.
Girls see that they're bleeding and use whatever cloth they can find.
Imagine how harmful and dangerous that is. It starts getting soaked.
Initially, in our meetings,
Initially, in our meetings, we used to tell them, "The cloth should be washed.
we used to tell them, "The cloth should be washed.
The cloth shouldn't be dirty."
Now, we are talking about pads.
There are a lot of things that still need to be changed.
A lot needs to change.
The daughter never talks to the mother, the wife never talks to the husband.
Friends don't talk to each other.
Menstruation is the biggest taboo in my country.
I'm Arunachalam Muruganantham,
the man who invented the low-cost sanitary napkin machine.
Our mission is creating India into a 100% napkin-using country
from the current level of less than ten percent.
There's a village called Kathikhera nearby.
You might have heard of it. It is pretty close.
A machine is being installed there. It's called a pad machine.
It's used to make pads. You know what a pad is, right?
Yes? No?
No!
I haven't even heard the name.
We see them on the TV and in the stores, but we can't afford them.
No one uses it in our family.
They say that if we wear pads, we'll be fine wherever we go.
Nobody would make fun of you for wearing a cloth or anything.
Would you use a pad if we gave it to you?
-I won't know how to use it. -It won't get wet!
Show me.
Peel from here?
How do you use it?
Hello! Switch off your phones, please. You'll be doing this on your own tomorrow.
Pay attention.
Suman, please observe what material he uses at each step.
Take notes.
This is our primary raw material to make the pads.
With your hands here, snap the lid shut like this.
Is everything clear till now, or does it look like magic to you?
All good? That's done.
Once you have done this three times, slide the tray out.
Go slow and then leave it.
Okay?
Put this around here and wrap it about ten to 20 times.
Lay it straight, press the pedal, and you'll get another cut.
You can do this, right? Now your pad is ready!
Rekha, ask your uncle about this. Does he know what it is?
-What do you mean? -What the machine is and what it does.
-He knows. -Ask him.
Uncle, do you know what this is?
No, I don't know what's going on here.
What do you think is going on here?
There's a machine here that makes those diapers.
Diapers for children. That's all he knows.
Yes, that's all I know.
You haven't told him about the machine that's being set up?
Okay.
Men in my family have always known what it is.
They're just not able to say it in front of you.
Uncle doesn't know. We told him it's a diaper machine.
You told him it's a diaper machine!
It makes that stuff for babies...
-I can't remember what the word is... -Pad for children.
Yes, "pad"!
I do want to tell them I'm working, but then he'll ask what kind of work...
So I can't bring it up with him.
The thing is, when there's patriarchy, it takes time
to talk about something related to women.
It's taking time even among us women, but we'll get there.
Everyone must think I'm an actress for you to be recording me.
I wonder what tomorrow is gonna be like.
I know a girl from our village who now works for the Delhi Police.
Who was she before that?
She could have gotten married and remained unknown.
Now everyone knows her. The whole village knows her name.
Today, her father is known by her daughter's name.
Up until then, it was the other way around.
Look how much it has changed.
No one has a better life than her.
How much is it? It's nine. Nine will be multiplied by two.
Let's go.
The biggest problem here is electricity. We could be out of power at any time.
Sometimes we stay in the dark for two days in a row.
The electrician's number is written out here.
Sometimes there's electricity at night,
and we rush to open the unit and turn this one machine on to prepare raw material.
But only if we haven't met our daily goal.
It's not safe to work at night.
Sometimes the atmosphere is more relaxed, and we have a good laugh.
This is our timetable. Working hours are from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
No one can visit us for chit-chat.
They sign at the time of entry and exit.
We do this on a daily basis.
How many are there?
These and those behind you are around 18,000 pads...
-Eighteen thousand? -Yes!
It will be a lot of trouble.
It's looking pretty. It's an ordinary thing, but it's pretty.
Suman, how about we get a rack and display these for the visitors?
We had our reasons behind the name "Fly."
We have installed this machine for women.
So, now we want women to rise and fly.
We have a unit which employs women to make sanitary pads for their livelihood.
Now that the pads are done, we are looking for places to sell them.
We will talk about its quality and price.
We'll explain the difference between our pads and others.
Okay?
There are other stores around. Here, here, and a couple more up the road.
Are you watching?
This one doesn't drip.
Do you see the difference?
Our pad can soak up more than the other pad.
Guys! Please go outside.
-Whoever is available. -Goudan!
How are you, Goudan?
These are pads.
-Is anyone home? -See, I don't have any money.
Please come. I won't bite.
Brother, we have set up a unit for making sanitary pads.
Girls have a hard time buying pads from shops...
because there are a lot of men around.
It would certainly be easier for them to get pads from another woman.
We won't have to go knocking on doors in the future.
People will come to us.
Okay, you're pregnant. You don't need it now.
-What about you? -I also don't need them.
-Are you pregnant, too? -I recently delivered a baby.
It's difficult, but we'll keep trying.
We just have to work harder.
The other pad is beautiful to look at, whereas ours is rather ugly.
You have to decide whether you prefer beauty or quality.
Our pad is like a man who is not good-looking,
but it is competent.
It doesn't look very pretty.
-Is it good to use? -Yes, it is good to use.
Have you sold anything before?
I've never sold anything. That's why I'm finding it difficult.
If you buy pads from the market...
it will be expensive, and...
and...
-Of lesser quality. -Of lesser quality.
So, now you tell me, who is going to use our pads?
Does anyone want to buy this pack right now?
-Who wants it? -Me.
This side will stick to our panties.
Why don't you come down and have a look?
-I'm seeing them from here. -Okay!
Would you like to buy them?
I'll take one pack.
...fifty, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100. Two-hundred and ten.
Our first earnings.
We came here to give a demonstration only.
We never thought we'd be able to sell out here.
These are our first earnings. 180 rupees on our very first day.
-Okay? -Okay.
Money in my pocket.
If this machine works, what's the scale that you're looking at?
I'm thinking big, Manadakini.
If you share it with somebody, it sounds like a crazy dream.
It makes pads. A lot of people know about it.
-We buy them from there. -Has anyone ever tried any other pad?
No. We were embarrassed to go buy them.
If they require more people to work on the pad machine,
then we would want to work there.
I just went to have a look. Then I started asking about the process.
Then I asked, "What is this for?"
"What happens after it comes out of this?"
Then there's a machine you press that puts the pad together.
Then I asked, "What about this one?"
Eventually, I made one myself.
I made a good pad.
I gained respect in the eyes of my husband,
since I was producing instead of sitting idle at home.
It feels good that he respects me.
My younger brother came to visit.
I bought him a suit and told him,
I bought him a suit and told him, "Usually, it's the brother who gives his sister a gift,
but today a sister will give a gift to her brother."
I got him clothes because I had money.
I'm a little bit feminist.
Women are the base of any society.
And women are more powerful. But they don't recognize themselves.
They don't know how much power they have and what can they do.
Have you ever worked before this?
No.
-This is your first job? -Yes, it is.
The world can't go ahead without women.
We are the creators of the universe!
Women aren't able to do anything, right?
After I become a cop, I imagine myself walking around in plain clothes,
and if some guy messes with me, I'll whip his ass.
Five years from now, I think I'll be working for the Delhi Police.
I'll have lots of money
and I'll fulfill my parents' dreams.
And my own dreams.
Just like I see my life changing, I see a lot of change out here as well.
the 1970 World Cup open.
The 1970 World Cup is underway!
My father said,
“Football is for people who have guts.”
Everything that came out in the press,
that I didn’t have what it took to come back, that I wasn’t in good shape…
Pelé’s form has declined to the point he’s no longer the Pelé of old.
…it was a lot of pressure.
It's no longer time for talking.
It's time for fighting.
The World Cup was important for the country.
But at that moment,
I didn't want to be Pelé.
I didn’t like it, I didn’t want it.
I was praying,
"God, please help me. This is my last World Cup."
Brazil is my country.
It means everything to me.
It's the country that brought me into this world.
Brazil was a "young" country, very much unknown.
I can remember my grandparents delivering wood.
They had a horse and cart,
and I rode on the horses a lot when I was about ten.
I had no idea that other countries existed.
I thought Brazil was the most beautiful country in the world.
We came from nothing and had very little.
We were poor, but we were able to work.
My dad worked.
My dad was a footballer, and his nickname was Dondinho.
I was known as Dondinho's son.
My dream was always to equal my dad.
I thought he was the best player in the world.
When Pelé arrived home from school,
all he did was play football with his friends.
He just loved football.
At home, he’d get up to mischief.
He was always a bit of a live wire.
There was a period in my dad's career
when he got injured and his club didn't pay him.
Pelé thought he should help out at home,
so he got a job.
I cleaned and shined shoes to help my family.
Did you ever dream that one day you'd become a famous footballer?
My background kept me levelheaded,
and still does,
which is down to my family.
I’ve never thought, at any point in my life,
that I am better than anyone else.
I'm lucky that these were the values my parents gave me.
But when my dad noticed that he was talented enough to become a footballer,
But when my dad noticed that he was talented enough to become a footballer, he really encouraged it.
So they went to Santos.
I was the first person at Santos who met Pelé.
We often had players come for a trial, but they were never any good.
In that first training session, he showed his amazing talent.
He shook my hand so strongly that I thought,
"I want to be on his team and not against him!"
He arrived with such personality. He wasn't afraid of anything.
He wasn't afraid of anything. It was as if he'd been with us for years.
It was as if he'd been with us for years.
I was only 16,
but I could now say that I was a professional footballer.
And then I was called up to the 1958 World Cup.
We had some idea of how great a player he could be.
But when he was called up to the national team,
we were simply overjoyed.
I said, "Cool, we're going to Sweden."
I'd never even left Brazil before.
We thought Brazil was well known in Europe,
but it wasn't.
There were some Swedish kids
who kept touching my face, and I thought,
"What's going on?"
They were looking at their hands to see if the dye came off!
They'd never seen a Black person before.
Back then, Brazil wasn't considered a football nation.
We weren't favorites by any stretch.
I saw a skinny kid
who should have felt the pressure of being called up to a World Cup.
But he didn't.
He was so confident.
Some journalists said that I was too young to play,
that I wasn't experienced enough.
But my dad always said to me…
"Don't worry, son. Believe in yourself."
"On the pitch, you're all the same."
And that thought lifted me.
The ball comes to Pelé, he controls it and shoots…
Pelé scores for Brazil!
In 1950, the World Cup was in Brazil.
We were just kids.
When Brazil hosted the World Cup in 1950,
there was a real hope that Brazil would make its mark
and leave behind its backward past.
There was no TV back then, so only those in the stadium saw it.
I was one of them.
There were 200,000 fans inside the Maracanã stadium.
Brazil was going all out to do everything possible
to appear on the world stage through football.
My fellow Brazilians, in a matter of minutes,
you will become world champions.
We kept our word and built this stadium.
Now do your duty and win us the World Cup.
Brazil on the attack…
It comes to Friaça… he shoots!
Brazil score!
We were all huddled around the radio,
chatting and listening to the game.
Ghiggia has it…
he finds Schiaffino… Uruguay score!
A goal for Uruguay. They've equalized.
Ghiggia on the right,
he runs towards the Brazilian goal… Goal!
Uruguay score their second goal!
Uruguay win 2-1.
Everyone was silent on the streets.
It was truly a tragedy.
1950 represents
the great national failure.
It was after that defeat that the playwright Nelson Rodrigues
coined the term,
the "Mongrel Complex."
He meant that Brazil wilted, shrank into the shadows,
and praised the virtues of others.
"The others are great and we aren't worth a thing."
Because a mongrel is a street dog.
I didn't know what to say to my dad because he'd been crying.
So I said to him, "Don't worry, don't be sad."
"I'll win a World Cup for you."
In a few moments,
Brazil against Sweden will get underway in the World Cup Final.
Liedholm scores!
Sweden 1-0 Brazil.
Is it going to be another disaster?
Vavá finds Pelé,
and Pelé shoots!
What a shot by Pelé!
Nilton Santos crosses to Pelé, he controls it…
Incredible goal by Pelé!
He was a prodigy.
We used to laugh
because we were watching
the greatest player of all time emerge before our eyes.
Brazil are world champions!
It was a dream.
It was amazing.
I didn't sleep that night.
I didn't sleep because I wanted to find out if people back home in Brazil, and especially my family, had listened to the games.
and especially my family, had listened to the games.
"Will they have seen my goals?"
Look at this scene!
The people have taken over!
People are jumping! They're shouting!
They're all here to celebrate Brazil's victory
and welcome home our incredible players.
Pelé emerges as the guy
who solved this Mongrel Complex.
He made Brazilians love themselves again.
Symbolically, that's no small thing.
Pelé was the man of the hour.
Wherever we'd go, it was, "Pelé, Pelé, Pelé…"
When people would come up to us, we'd say, "Look over there! There's Pelé!"
Everyone would surge over there, and we'd laugh so hard.
Girls wanted Pelé as their boyfriend.
Boys wanted Pelé as their brother. Parents wanted Pelé as their son.
And everyone wanted Pelé as their neighbor.
Because he was totally captivating.
His natural charisma
gave him star quality.
From that point on, his status just kept growing.
He was treated like royalty…
by Black, white, and mixed-race people.
He became the symbol of Brazilian emancipation.
I was able to experience the joy that everyone felt,
You had poor boys in the favela
who saw themselves in Pelé and said, "I want to be like Pelé!"
Because he was the most inspiring image that we'd ever had of a poor Black boy.
that we'd ever had of a poor Black boy.
I couldn't go out. There were people wherever I went.
I didn't know what to do.
And then there were my dad's friends! They forgot about him,
and wanted to know about little Pelé instead.
So it was hard to adapt.
It must have been difficult for him.
He was so young,
and all he wanted to do was play football and show his talent.
Pelé… Pelé… Pelé…
Before Pelé, Santos was a small club.
They had no importance.
Pelé arrives.
Pelé single-handedly took the team to the next level.
It's not that Pelé made the difference.
Pelé was the difference.
The Brazilian kid isn't 19 yet.
He may well be the best footballer in the world right now.
Do you think you're the best player in the world since '58?
I've never believed in a best player in the world.
To be the best player in the world,
you need to be better in every position than everyone else.
And that's tricky, isn't it?
Pelé has just turned 21.
In the space of four years between 1957 and 1961,
Pelé has scored 355 goals.
An amount that even the greatest players only manage by the end of their careers.
While I am President of Santos,
Pelé will not be for sale.
He's a national treasure and won't be sold for any price.
Santos will play Benfica for the Intercontinental Cup.
Sensational goal by Pelé! A gem!
Santos 5-2 Benfica.
Santos are world champions!
I was lucky to have the boys at Santos.
They gave me a lot of strength.
So much strength.
If you don't speak in English, don't talk to me.
I'm the one working, and you guys come here and disturb me!
-But I'm well. -You're well?
Let's go.
Look how well I am.
Do you want to see? Let me go.
Stand back.
Look how well I am.
Did anyone call me?
He just did a doughnut!
You guys are the best.
You brought the sun with you.
What a beautiful day.
Edu wanted to get a tan.
It was God who put this team together.
It was incredible, wasn't it?
It was a family.
Something that Brazil owes Santos,
is that when we used to go on tour,
we'd beat the best teams in Italy, Germany, and all across Europe,
and people started talking about Brazil.
Nobody knew where Brazil was until then.
Do you remember that time we were playing in Europe?
And the coach said, "Damn, Pelé's injured."
He said, "Let's think about this."
"The rest of our attack is Black like you,
so Dorval can wear your number 10 shirt, and no one will know any different."
So I wore the number 10
but people quickly realized I wasn't Pelé,
and they all started chanting, "Pelé, Pelé, Pelé!"
And you had to come on, even though you were injured.
I think they must have thought,
"But Pelé is usually so handsome, it can't be him!"
They thought you were good-looking? Come on, man, get over yourself!
You were the King. We knew that.
But we wanted to help and play our part too.
Ah, this whole thing of being the King…
Do you remember when we went to Paris and I sang that samba?
It went,
What kind of king am I
Without a kingdom or a crown?
With no castle or queen…
With no castle or queen Drifting aimlessly around the world
Well, at least your singing has improved!
The voice is as bad as it's always been!
Don't eat too much. We've got a game tomorrow!
That World Cup was there to be Pelé's tournament.
He was about to turn 22,
he was experienced,
and he was world football's biggest star.
We expected so much from him because of what he'd done in '58.
Then came the second game against Czechoslovakia.
Pelé hits the post!
Pelé is injured!
It was 0-0,
and Pelé got injured.
I didn't know what it was.
I was young, I was a kid,
I'd never had an injury like this before.
We were hoping he'd recover quickly,
but he wasn't able to play in that World Cup again.
Those were the cards that were dealt, and Pelé's replacement was Amarildo.
and Pelé's replacement was Amarildo.
I read a newspaper headline that said, "Brazil cries over Pelé."
And, of course, here in Brazil,
Pelé's absence was a tragedy.
But Pelé spoke to me and said,
"Hey, kid…
it's up to you now."
When you get injured
and have your journey cut short in a World Cup,
it's hard to take.
But I said to the other players,
"Come on, don't worry! We're a team, not just one player."
Zagallo takes the throw
and finds Amarildo.
Amarildo goes past his defender…
Brazil score!
Brazil! Brazil!
Brazil are now two-time world champions!
After the game, when we were in the dressing room,
when we were in the dressing room, he came into the shower fully clothed
he came into the shower fully clothed
and gave me a big hug.
Despite not playing, he was there on the pitch in spirit,
spurring us on to success.
The World Cup is over!
Brazil win again!
Let's celebrate!
The late '50s and early '60s
were undoubtedly some of the best times
in Brazil's history.
Pelé rose to fame
at the moment of Brazil's birth as a modern country.
It was no longer just a country that exported produce,
but a nation of industry, efficiency, and culture.
It was a country that believed in itself and could succeed.
Brazil stopped being the country of tomorrow, and became the country of today.
And Pelé is not a supporting actor in this, he's the protagonist.
King Pelé. Scene one, take one.
Pelé, the living room is full of people. There are reporters in the kitchen!
I'm becoming famous.
Pelé came through at a time
when TV was getting big.
He was a product of his era.
Pelé, have you ever thought about working in the movies?
No, I've never considered it.
Pelé is no longer a footballer, but a national institution.
He loved being an idol.
So for him it was very natural,
as if it was built into his DNA.
This product is so cool!
He had this image of a strong, healthy young guy,
who scored a lot of goals and was center of attention. He was magnetic.
-What's this coffee? -It's Café Pelé.
It's delicious!
You know it.
"Where do you come from?" "I'm from Brazil."
"Ah, the land of Pelé!"
He made Brazilians proud to say,
"We don't need to look up to the English, Germans, French, or Italians."
"They trail in our wake
because when it comes to football, we're better than you."
It was football that was now our identity.
Those were happy times.
We thought that democracy would last forever.
Unfortunately, it didn't.
What was the reason behind the coup?
Brazil was supposedly being led by communists.
But this had no grounding at all.
In 1964, there was no chance of Brazil becoming a communist country,
but that was the justification used by the military.
It was a U.S. project designed to stimulate dictatorships in the Americas
in order to avoid the spread of Soviet Communism.
A different Brazil had arrived.
All that joy from the late '50s and early '60s
went down the drain.
Did the dictatorship change anything for you?
No, football went on in the same way.
There weren't any noticeable differences.
Certainly not for me.
I've been invited to participate
in politics,
but honestly,
I've got no desire to get involved.
Football already takes up most of my time,
and ultimately, I don't understand anything about politics.
Pelé simply accepted the regime and lived with it.
The fact that the regime wanted to treat him well,
because it realized how important this relationship was,
meant he was just a person that got on with his life
and wasn't harmed by it.
Pelé, three years ago
you told me you were looking to settle down.
How do you feel now you're in love?
I didn't tell peopleI had a girlfriend
so the papers wouldn't talk about it,
and it wouldn't become public.
The first serious relationship that made me want to start a family
was when I met Rose here in Santos.
I was a little shy.
Then I made friends with her father.
I'd offer to shine
her dad's shoes for his approval.
I thought it was time to settle down,
and I became closer to her family
until we eventually got married.
I married her because I was attracted to her. I was young, I was still a boy.
We liked each other and were good friends,
but that crazy thing of being in love?
We really didn't have it.
Do you have any hobbies in common?
Dancing.
Dancing, music… Popular music.
Do you and your husband have enough time together?
He knows how to split his time between football and family,
and it works well.
What was it like to be your wife? Do you think it was hard?
I think it was hard. I think so.
I started to have more professional commitments
outside of football.
I signed contracts
to advertise products around the world.
I began to travel more often for this kind of work
than for football.
That was challenging for my family and for my relationship.
I understood that.
Was it hard for you to remain faithful with girls throwing themselves at you?
Honestly, it was.
I had some affairs that resulted in children,
but I only became aware of them later.
My first wife knew about everything.
I never lied to anyone.
We're at the airport, and we're waiting
for Edson Arantes do Nascimento, Pelé.
Mr. Pelé, would you like to introduce your wife to us?
I don't speak French.
You don't speak French?
Are you visiting Paris?
Yes, I've been visiting Paris with my wife and I enjoyed it.
I'd like to come back here in the future.
Who are the favorites for the next World Cup?
It's difficult for Brazil as we're going for our third World Cup in a row.
It's difficult for Brazil as we're going for our third World Cup in a row. All the teams will be well prepared.
-But we'll do our best to win it. -Thank you.
I was chatting to some friends
about the Brazilian fans
who think we've already won our third World Cup.
We've even been given banners
saying, "Three-time champions," to sign at the hotel.
I don't like that.
I think that weighs horribly on us.
You have to let things happen naturally.
In football, you win or lose on the pitch.
-We'll win, won't we, Pelé? -God willing.
I had this dream
of winning the World Cup in England.
I thought Brazil could win,
become champions again, and my job would be complete.
What do you think about this type of defensive football
What do you think about this type of defensive football where they mark you tightly?
where they mark you tightly?
We have to get used to playing like this.
Football used to be more classic, something for the fans, a spectacle.
Now teams only play for results.
Football has become ugly. Teams are playing harder.
For the majority of players it was our first World Cup,
including myself.
Pelé was leading us as the best player in Brazil and in the world.
So our opponents set up a system
to mark Pelé out of the tournament.
"We've got to nullify the threat of Pelé."
Football today is different.
Football today is tougher,
there's more marking,
teams play more defensively.
Today it's common to hear, "Let's target Pelé! Put three players on Pelé!"
"Let's target Pelé! Put three players on Pelé!"
I thought the standard of refereeing was deplorable.
And as a result of this woeful refereeing,
we were subjected
to new levels of violence in each game.
People are saying
that this was your last World Cup.
We can't let that happen because the world needs your football.
We need the spectacle that you give the fans
as the greatest player in the world. -Is it true? -It is.
People have asked me this question a few times, so let me clear it up.
I don't intend to play in a World Cup again
because I'm not lucky in World Cups.
This is the second one I've been to
where I've only played two games and got injured.
It shook the nation.
It shook all us players too.
Why is Pelé quitting the national team
when he's young enough to play in more World Cups?
To be forced out of that World Cup was devastating.
I said, "Oh, man,
what now? What am I going to do?"
I thought, "I can end my run here."
I was upset, I wanted to say goodbye.
He was devastated.
It was hard to encourage him to play again,
because he was really down at that time.
Brazil had been very poor in England in 1966.
The country was already under a dictatorship,
but the situation worsened with Institutional Act Number 5,
the infamous AI-5, that was imposed on us in 1968.
His excellency, the President of the Republic,
has decided to implement an Institutional Act
that gives the government
the necessary tools
to secure order and peace.
It took away every freedom you could think of.
Anyone could be arrested
without due cause.
People simply disappeared.
My role was to sign AI-5.
Some have said it was used to torture people…
Obviously.
Because when man has power,
he's the only animal capable of killing his own kind.
General Médici was the dictator
during the worst phase of torture and murder.
He was the cruelest dictator that Brazil ever had.
He understood how football captivated people.
So it became common to see General Médici
watching football with a radio glued to his ear,
while political prisoners were being tortured elsewhere,
and the general was at the game creating a "nice guy" image.
Did you know about the torture happening in the late 1960s?
If I told you I didn't know anything,
I would be lying.
We knew about a lot of things.
But we weren't sure
what was true or false
because Santos spent so much time abroad,
we didn't know what news was true or not.
Here in Brazil, we were always told
to be careful and not leave the hotel.
I felt worried.
What was your relationship with the various governments like?
My door was always open.
Everyone knows this.
And that includes when things were really bad.
I was always sought out to take sides.
I don't know which political side he's on,
but Pelé has never been one to identify himself with a government.
He's always been much more than that.
Every country needs a hero.
People need to believe in something.
A sense of belonging
can be more important than your daily struggles,
and sport is part of that.
People aren't just paying attention to politics.
They're paying attention to what is more important for them,
and that's living their everyday lives.
Pelé helped in this process.
Pelé's achievements merge with national glory,
whoever wins.
A dictatorship? It wins with him.
A democracy? It wins in the same way.
Pelé's here with me,
and he's going to give us an exclusive interview.
Pelé! How emotional!
The pleasure is all mine,
especially when you consider the expectations surrounding today.
You can't even imagine how I'm feeling.
This is the ball for the 1000th goal.
It's the only one in the world
because no player has ever achieved this feat.
Pelé's name has just been announced!
This is an indescribable feeling.
Show these people who are cheering for the King.
The first sportsman in the world
with the chance to score 1,000 goals.
Congratulations, Pelé! Congratulations, Brazil!
We are 14 minutes from the end of the game.
Here's Pelé… Penalty!
A clear penalty!
All we had left in this sad struggle was football.
It was escapism for us in Brazil.
And in Pelé, we had an unrivaled leader and hero.
The stadium wants Pelé. The biggest stadium in the world is ready for the biggest player in the world.
The biggest stadium in the world is ready for the biggest player in the world.
Here's Pelé with the goal of the century at his feet.
I thought, "If the keeper saves it
or the ball hits the bar, where are my teammates?"
I couldn't see anyone.
Everyone was behind me.
My legs were shaking. I said to myself,
"I can't miss this penalty."
Pelé was a shining star,
glowing in the black sky of Brazilian life.
He symbolized Brazil's potential
to be a fairer and happier country.
That's what Pelé represented.
Pelé, we thank you eternally
for what you've done for Brazil
and for our sport that is the soul of the people.
Pelé get some well-deserved rest.
No one deserves it more than you.
If I was ever told that anyone famous or important wanted to meet me
or have lunch with me,
then I would always go if I could.
I didn't see any issues.
I was told that the President wanted to congratulate me,
and so I went.
I was never forced to do anything. Never.
For many people, they'll look less at what he did on the pitch
and more at what he did off it.
Off the pitch, he's characterized by his political neutrality.
At that moment in history, it's going to count against him.
I love Pelé, but that won't stop me criticizing him.
I thought his behavior was that of a Black person who only said, "Yes, sir."
I thought his behavior was that of a Black person who only said, "Yes, sir." A Black person who is submissive, accepts everything
A Black person who is submissive, accepts everything
and doesn't answer back, question or judge.
It's one of the criticisms I hold against him to this day
because one single statement from Pelé would go a long way in Brazil.
Being who he was, he couldn't…
just turn his back on the President.
But then you could tell me that Muhammad Ali was different.
Indeed, he was.
And I applaud him for it.
Muhammad Ali knew
that he would be arrested for refusing the draft,
but he ran no risk of being mistreated
or tortured.
Pelé had no assurance of that.
A dictatorship is a dictatorship.
Only those who've lived it know how it hurts.
I don't think I could have done anything different.
Why?
"What were you doing during the dictatorship?"
"Which side were you on?"
You get lost in these things.
I'm Brazilian. I want what's best for my people.
I was no superman, no miracle man.
I was just a normal person
to whom God granted the gift of being a footballer.
But I'm totally convinced
that I helped Brazil a lot more with my football, with my way of being,
than the politicians whose job it was to do this very thing.
TERESÓPOLIS WELCOMES OUR GOLDEN NATIONAL TEAM
COME ON, GOLDEN TEAM
It was a period where the dictatorship in Brazil was at its most extreme.
It was the peak of repression, censorship, and restriction of speech.
Amongst it all, there lay an oasis
of beauty and hope,
of positive and stimulating emotion,
which was the 1970 World Cup.
Since the fiasco of the 1966 World Cup in England,
the national team was in turmoil.
Winning the World Cup became
a government issue.
The technical staff
was almost entirely made up of military personnel.
A number of fascist slogans were created.
"Brazil, love it or leave it."
"No one can stop this country."
Nationalist euphoria took over in the worst possible way,
Nationalist euphoria took over in the worst possible way, encouraged by the dictatorship.
Pelé doesn't like to deal with this subject, but there were messages from the dictatorship
but there were messages from the dictatorship saying he'd better play at the World Cup.
For the President, that became
something of personal importance.
Why?
Because if the people are happy,
then the government is also happy.
Did you feel pressure from the government to come back?
Always.
I'd always get offers to go and speak to politicians and people in power.
There were always people wanting me to come back.
I was torn.
I didn't want to play in the '70 World Cup.
I didn't want to go through what I went through in England.
I was in doubt.
I was worried, but also I missed it.
I just wanted to be remembered.
But this is it.
This is my last World Cup.
King, are you ever coming back?
But if I sit here and say,
"I came back for the 1970 World Cup because of the Brazilian people,"
I'd be lying.
I came back for me.
What was Saldanha like?
The guy was crazy!
But he was a damn good guy.
He was also demanding.
He didn't care if you were Pelé, the King of football,
he made the same demands of everyone.
A good thing about him
was that he wasn't a coward, he didn't fear anything.
It's just that sometimes he'd say things
that weren't necessary.
But he wanted to be the big man.
So personally,
if you were to ask me if he understood football,
then I'd say no, he didn't.
"João, what about if we do this, this, and this?"
And he'd be like, "But I'm the coach, I'm in charge."
And we'd reply, "Sure, let's chat."
Because he made a lot of decisions
that we could see weren't going to go right.
Pelé, Saldanha has shown us his plans,
and you're playing as a striker.
You don't enjoy playing there, do you?
No, it's not that I don't like playing there,
but in my current condition,
I can play deeper.
I've been playing deeper for 15 years,
and to ask me to change how I play from one moment to the next
just isn't possible.
There was something going on there.
Saldanha had his run-ins with Pelé during training.
They just didn't get along.
Given that João Saldanha liked showing off,
he gave an interview to a journalist
saying he was very concerned
because I'd undergone an eye exam,
and he thought I couldn't see properly.
João Saldanha was someone who was very particular and unpredictable.
I say that with affection because he was a very good friend of mine.
He also liked a good lie.
But I honestly can't explain why he made up the story
that Pelé was short-sighted and couldn't play.
Saldanha said he was blind.
He knew how to needle.
He said, "He's no good."
"He's blind. He can't see." Fuck!
Pelé was fuming.
"Pelé has issues with his eyesight."
That information came from the coach, João Saldanha.
How did you react to this?
I thought it was nasty,
but he clearly wanted to lash out at someone.
And it worked for him because it created a real storm.
You have the best player of all time
and you want to leave him on the bench?
"Pelé's not playing well, he's terrible…"
It doesn't matter, he's got to play!
So there were fights and arguments,
and a movement to oust Saldanha from the national team was born.
When the Brazilian FA offered me the job,
many people said they'd rather have someone else.
I call this the right to have an opinion. I'm not a child
and I won't resign.
The government pulled some strings
not only to get Pelé on the pitch,
but we interfered in football.
The President and I have a lot in common.
We're both from the South, we support the same club,
and we like football.
But I don't choose his ministers, and the President doesn't pick my team.
That way we understand each other well.
When we watched that interview we were like,
"Wow! The shit's going to hit the fan!"
It was inevitable…
They sacked Saldanha.
I took over the reins with two months to go.
Pelé said that he was upset
because of what was coming out in the papers,
with Saldanha saying he was blind.
He wanted to answer his critics.
During training, Zagallo came up to me and said, "Pelé, what's going on?"
"You're not getting stuck in, you're not yourself."
He was right.
I was concerned for myself.
I wanted to be in good physical shape.
In our first training session,
he put a hand on my shoulder
and said, "Zagallo,
don't mess me about."
I said to him,
"You're unique."
"I'll never leave you out."
"You can help me win the World Cup."
I can happily talk about Pelé's mood
as I was lucky enough to play with him in '58 and '62.
And now as coach,
I feel that Pelé is the same boy
that helped us win both those World Cups.
Pelé's form has dipped to a level
where you can mark him differently because he's no longer the Pelé of old.
Oh my God!
We left Brazil totally discredited.
Brazilians didn't believe in that team and thought we wouldn't get past the group stage.
That was when
he began enjoying himself again.
His intelligence, his confidence… It was a spectacle.
Pelé is the author of the most incredible non-goals
in the history of football.
Today a lot of people score from the halfway line.
But he was the first to try it.
And in a World Cup.
He got something out of his system.
"The King is here. I'm the damn King."
They played well. Wow!
But that was just one game.
You need to keep winning in a World Cup.
I think England
are the big favorites.
England are the holders,
so they have to be favorites.
But Brazil will give it everything.
We knew it was going to be a difficult match against England.
We studied how they played and the way they defended.
Everyone said the same thing, whoever won that match
could go all the way.
Pelé controlled it.
He was surrounded by the entire defense, who blocked his way.
But I was coming up on the outside.
He'd already seen me a million years ago.
It was the biggest celebration of my entire career!
1-0 to Brazil.
It was spectacular and beautiful, like a game of chess.
And we won. Fuck, that was great.
We became even stronger.
1970 was a blessing.
The brotherhood in that team was impressive.
The messing around between the players, you didn't see that every day.
We were representing our country.
It wasn't just for us, but for all Brazilians.
Every victory was for the Brazilian people, that's how we felt.
I covered the 1970 World Cup, and let me make it very clear
that I was against the dictatorship. I went there to cheer against my country.
We imagined that if Brazil won the World Cup
it would bolster the dictatorship, and none of us wanted that.
But when it comes to football, the heart rules the head.
You forget your principles once the ball starts rolling.
Once we were there, it was impossible not to get behind our team.
We were a game away from the World Cup Final.
But the whole of Brazil was in panic.
"Yes, we're doing well, Pelé's playing great…
but it's Uruguay."
"It's Uruguay, and we know how that always goes."
We can't forget that in the 1950 World Cup Final,
staged in Rio de Janeiro,
it was Uruguay who defeated favorites Brazil
to become world champions.
Football is unpredictable,
but could the same thing happen again 20 years later?
One of the things I did before going to bed was to pray.
I said, "Will tomorrow go well?"
These psychological aspects can really affect you.
You truly lose control. You can't explain it.
We were lucky to equalize and make it 1-1.
I made them aware that we'd been dreadful.
"You have to play the way we know,
which isn't what happened in the first half."
"I don't need to say anything else."
You begin to worry and things stop working.
But it's about telling yourself you have to do it.
I have my doubts as to whether there was only one Pelé on the pitch
because it seemed like there were three of him.
It was the return of Superman.
He transformed himself on the pitch,
and winning became non-negotiable for him.
I knew I was ready to play.
But there's always a doubt when playing sport.
Even the best in the world gets nervous from time to time, right?
Not from time to time, but all of the time.
When we were just about to arrive at the stadium,
and I looked out of the window
and saw all the fans with Brazil flags,
shouting, "Brazil! Pelé!",
it made me burst into tears.
I wanted to stop crying, but I couldn't.
I was the oldest player,
and I didn't want the other players to think, "Why is he crying?"
It was emotional, an outpouring.
"God, this is my last World Cup, help me in my last World Cup."
"I want your help in my last World Cup."
I'm sorry…
I just couldn't hold it in.
The stadium is completely full.
It's the biggest occasion in sport.
We are here and can only imagine your expectations back home in Brazil.
We are here and can only imagine your expectations back home in Brazil. What will the score be?
I wasn't concerned about scoring or playing well against Italy.
I just wanted us to win.
I just needed to come out the other side.
He needed 1970.
He needed the header he scored against Italy.
He needed to punch the air.
Carlos Alberto crosses… Pelé slides in!
He was only a fraction of a second late!
It has nothing to do with fear,
but everything to do with responsibility.
You start putting this weight of responsibility on your shoulders,
and that's when it affects your emotions.
The ball comes to Jairzinho…
The ball comes to Jairzinho… he finds Gérson, who moves it on to his left foot and shoots…
he finds Gérson, who moves it on to his left foot and shoots…
He was always encouraging us
and gave us this belief that we could be great like he was.
Brazil score!
Jairzinho scores Brazil's third!
Brazil have the World Cup in their sights!
It was just relief.
I think the biggest gift you receive in victory isn't the trophy.
It's the relief.
He gave three cries in the dressing room that still give me goosebumps today.
“I didn’t die, I didn’t die, I didn’t die.”
What more could Pelé ask for?
Pelé was everything.
He was everything you could imagine.
It was the victory he wanted to leave as his legacy.
He accomplished what he set out to do,
and thank God he did it.
Pelé managed to solder his success with Brazil's success.
It was as if he was at war with a Brazilian flag in his hand.
His legend is our legend.
The 1970 World Cup was the best time of my life,
but it was more important for the country
because if Brazil had lost in '70, everything could have become worse.
The whole country could take a breath when we became champions.
1970 definitely did more for Brazil than it did for football.
Without a doubt.
Obviously, the dictatorship exploited that victory.
But the Brazilian people never attributed that World Cup win to our murderous dictator, General Médici.
to our murderous dictator, General Médici.
You only need to see how history remembers that win.
It doesn't belong to Médici.
It belongs to Pelé.
Thousands of white scarves bidding farewell to Pelé
on his last game for Brazil.
LONG LIVE THE KING
He's enchanted fans who say his name in every language.
[girl 2] There's this tradition at my school.
Every year, on the Saturday after graduation,
the seniors of Kiffney-Brown Prep break into the school's bell tower,
-party at the top… -Whoo!
…and take turns ringing the bell for an hour.
It's a rite of passage that everyone looks forward to all year.
To mark the end of the hour,
they TP the tower.
[all] Two, one!
It's actually kind of beautiful.
It's not supposed to be beautiful. It's supposed to be a prank.
Right. But, like, it happens every year, so…
So it's essentially school-sanctioned, right?
Like, if they wanted to stop it, they could,
which is fine, for a tradition.
But I mean, like, as a transgressive act, it's faulty.
Right?
-If it's faulty, what are you doing here? -Yeah.
I mean, I… I wanna do it, I… I was just pointing out…
Anyway, there's no rule that says that all seniors have to participate, so…
Come on. I wanna get a good spot at the top.
Shit.
[girl 2] If this were an isolated incident, it'd be fine.
[boy] Let's go!
[girl 2] But the truth is, I do this all the time.
Which is why,
instead of celebrating at the top of the bell tower with my classmates,
I'm at home
with my mom and her colleagues,
a bunch of old people.
[woman] Nothing is gonna change
when we don't recognize a woman merits our attention
unless she's married to or having sex with a more famous man.
And that is why I'm never getting married again.
-What are your plans for the summer? -I'm spending it with my father in Colby.
She thinks that they're gonna bond.
-Mom. -[tongue clicks]
It's a judgment on your father, not you.
[chuckles] I'm saving money for college. I'm gonna work in my stepmom's store.
And what was the name of that place? Oh, um… [tongue clicks]
Cupcake Glitter Breast Implants.
[woman 2] Good for you, Auden.
A summer at the beach sounds like the perfect reward for all your hard work.
I offered for her to be my research assistant,
but she chose this.
[Auden] I know my mom doesn't understand why I wanna go to Colby,
but it's like I only know how to be one kind of person here.
I've never done anything you can't read about on my transcript.
But maybe if I go to Colby, I can be someone else.
Someone different.
Or it will be exactly the same, and I can't change.
I don't know,
but I'm willing to bet the summer on it to find out.
[woman 3 squeals] Auden, hi!
I'm just calling again to say how capital E excited
your dad and I are to see you this summer.
Let me know the second you think you're gonna arrive.
Call me from the Colby sign-- No, call me before the Colby sign.
Call me every ten minutes because I cannot wait!
Wait, you know, it's Heidi, right? It's me.
It's Heidi, your stepmom. [chuckles] XOXO.
♪ And you disappeared ♪
-If you make a sound, I will murder you. -[baby crying]
[Auden] Oh, I'm sorry, I…
Oh my God, no, Auden. I'm so sorry.
I thought you were your father, and I… and I just got her to sleep,
and… [sighs] …I totally forgot what day it was.
-It's okay. -I had everything planned.
Banners, balloons. I even bookmarked ideas for a "Welcome to Colby"-themed brunch.
I swear to God, all last week, I kept thinking to myself,
"This is your stepdaughter. This is Thisbe's sister."
"You missed her graduation,
so you better get your ass in the kitchen and make this welcome special."
Is my dad here?
-Oh, he's in his office. -[Thisbe crying] He's always in his office.
-[man] Yeah? -Dad?
Oh! Hey! -There she is. Come on in, come in. -Hey.
And before you say anything, I know. It's a disaster area.
But I bet you remember that from when I was working on Narwhal.
Gotta say, Dad, in my memory of that time of our lives,
the status of your office cleanliness is not exactly what comes to mind.
[laughs] Yeah, 'cause your parents were breaking up.
Something about that.
Hey, are ya hungry? I know a great place for onion rings.
Really? Yeah. I'd… I'd love to. [chuckles]
Great, great. Head out to the boardwalk.
You can't miss it. It's called, uh, Last Chance. Here you go.
-You're not coming? -I wish I could, but I'm really swamped.
But if you wouldn't mind bringing me back a burger, that'd be, uh, that'd be great.
They have those caramelized onions, so good.
Yeah, of course.
-Thanks, Aud. -Yeah.
-I'm so glad you're here. Aw. -Yeah, me too.
-Great. -Okay.
[gasps] Oh my God! Auden… [chuckles] …you snuck up on me there.
I'm gonna go for a walk. Do you need anything?
-You should go to the Tip. -The Tip?
Yeah. It's where all the cool, young people hang out. Super fun.
-Can't miss it. -[Auden] Right.
-Don't be nervous. -I'm not.
Oh, when you get there, ask for Maggie. She's my favorite. She's great.
Cool. Uh, thanks.
You're young. Have fun.
-[boy 1] What's up? -[boy 2] Okay. All right.
So you're a summer transplant.
-Yeah, I guess you can call me that. -That's chill.
We've been broken up for two weeks, and he's doing this in front of me.
-[girl 1] Just don't look. -[girl 2] Maybe they're cousins.
[girl 3] They're not cousins!
Um, wait, I'm sorry.
Is everything okay?
[Auden] Yeah. Yes. Um, it's just…
Have you ever done something to be a different version of yourself,
but once you're in the middle of it, you think like, "Wow, this is so not me"?
-You're gay? -Oh, no. I mean, I don't think so.
It's all a spectrum, right? -But I was more talking about-- -[shushes]
It's okay, all right? Look, I'm not offended.
You're figuring this out, and that's chill.
But if you're not feelin' it with me, you're probably not feelin' it with dudes
because all the honeys love the Jake.
Oh, that's so cool. Um, I gotta go.
But thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you. So--
Oh, um, do you by any chance know where I could find someone named Maggie?
-Are you being serious? Is that a joke? -What? No.
-Never mind. Sorry. -[scoffs]
But, like, I'm fine.
-[girl 1] You're okay? -[girl 3] I'm fine. They had a great time, and I am fine. I'm doing good. I'm not.
They had a great time, and I am fine. I'm doing good. I'm not.
-[girl 2] Who is that? -[girl 1] Never seen her.
-[girl 3] I don't know her. -[girl 1] You're fine?
[girl 3] I'm fine. I'm great.
-[father] I told you to get a nanny. -[Heidi] I'm not asking for the world.
I'm asking for 20 minutes so I can brush my teeth and shower.
-Yeah, but it wasn't 20 minutes. -Oh my gosh--
[Heidi] Auden? Is that you?
Hi.
-Good morning, sleepyhead. -[Auden] Morning.
You just wake up? -Yeah, it's kind of unusual for me. -[Heidi] Oh.
-Yeah, I better get back to it. -[Heidi] Mm-hmm.
-Morning, kiddo. -Morning.
-Coffee. -[Heidi] Mm-hmm.
I didn't mean to make you feel guilty about sleeping in.
It's just that I have zero sense of time right now.
-[Heidi laughs] -It's okay.
So, you ready for your big day?
-Your first day at the store, silly. -Oh.
[chuckles] And don't worry. You don't need a schedule as long as everything gets done,
which I know it will, with you being Little Miss Honor Society.
Don't think I don't brag about you to everybody.
-[giggles] -[chuckles] Wow.
[Heidi] I'm so excited for you to meet the crew. Do you like flamingos?
-Aren't they the best bird? -They're cool.
And voilà. Welcome to my nirvana.
-It's great. -Would you mind?
-Oh, yeah, of course. -Oh, thank you.
Okay. Where are my ladies?
-[girls squealing] -Oh my God! -[Heidi laughs] -[girls gasp]
[girl 2] She's so beautiful.
[girl 1] OMG, her eyelashes.
[girl 3] Are you dying over how cute she is?
Oh, I missed you girls.
Well, don't worry about a thing here because we've got everything covered.
The Booty Berry perfume came in, and people are freaking out about it.
And the lock-and-key necklaces have been restocked three times.
[gasps] Did I tell you, or did I tell you? -Did I tell you? -Yep.
-I told you. I told you. -[girl 3] You told us.
[Heidi gasps] Oh! And this. Why are you hiding in the corner?
-Sorry. -This is who I've been telling you about.
My genius stepdaughter, Auden.
Auden, this is Esther, Leah, and Maggie.
Oh, we've met.
-We have? -At the Tip. You know my ex, Jake.
-Oh, yeah. -Oh, good.
Now I know you girls will take Auden under your wing and show her all the spots
and make her feel super comfortable here in Colby, right?
-Mm-hmm. -[Heidi] Good. [sighs]
All right, I better get the little one home before she has to eat.
Can I just tell you, my nipples… [groans]
But I love that you four are a new little crew.
So much fun.
-You good? -Yeah.
-Good. Okay. -[Auden] Mm-hmm. Love you guys. [kissing] Bye.
-[Esther] Let me get the door. -Okay, let's go!
Let's go into the world. We got this.
Okay! Here we go! Here we go!
-Why don't I show you the office? -Yeah. Mm-hmm.
All the accounting stuff is in here. Cool. Thanks.
Look, don't worry about Maggie. She'll get over it.
It's just Jake is like her kryptonite.
They were together for two years in high school.
They broke up right before graduation. It wasn't her idea.
-She was with that guy for two years? -Hmm.
What's the matter with her?
-What's the matter with me? -Oh, Maggie, I… I didn't--
-Here, last night's receipts. -I'm sorry.
-[lips smack] I should-- -Yeah. Do you need more pens?
-No, I'm good. Thank you. -No. That's a lot of pens. Good luck.
What was that?
Dance break. Happens every night at six.
You can join in next time if you want. We rotate who DJs.
What? She might be more into new wave.
I'm good.
-[customer] Thanks, girls. -[Maggie] Bye, Sarah.
[girls] Thank you for shopping at Clementine's.
Where to? And don't say the Tip. [Leah] Tally Ho?
[in unison] No, no, no to Tally Ho.
You guys are the worst.
We're just gonna go to Gas Gro, and it's depressing.
I'm gonna text Cala.
Who's Cala?
Just this blonde girl Esther is in love with.
-[Maggie chuckles] -How about you? What are you doing?
-Oh, I-- -I'm gonna see what the guys are up to.
She's actually nice. I promise.
It's okay. I was just leaving.
[boy 1] …like, not even kidding.
[boy 2] No, shut up, dude. Shut up, dude.
-[boy 1] I'm telling you, man. -[Maggie] Tally Ho!
$1.75.
$1.75.
[boy] We got the noodle!
Ninth one's free.
Oh, sorry. [chuckles] I didn't mean to scare you.
Colette, huh?
Loner.
Not always.
You're Auden, right?
-How'd you know that? -Will you let me make it up to you?
Are you making it up to me by taking me with you to do your laundry?
Um, no. But, uh, while we're here, I thought I might as well put some shirts in.
After you.
Hey. I had a feeling you'd turn up tonight.
I was all out of clean shirts.
-[man] Put on music. I'll make coffee. -Thanks, man. [clears throat]
That's Clyde. He's kind of a legend.
What is this? -Vertical checkers? -[boy laughs]
You've never heard of Connect Four?
Should I have? Is it, like, a laundromat requirement?
You just try to get, uh, four in a row.
I think I can handle that.
I'm sure you can, Miss Scholarship to Defriese.
[Auden] What? Okay, wait, wait, wait. How…
-How do you know all this stuff about me? -Heidi is very proud of you.
Right. How-- Does she know everyone?
It's Colby. Everyone knows everyone here.
-Here you go. Two cups, hot and fresh. -Thanks.
-Thank you. -I'll be back.
Oh wow.
Better than Gas Gro?
Lay off. I'm new here.
All right. I got raspberry peach or strawberry rhubarb. What'll it be?
We get to have pie too?
What's a secret pie shop without the pie?
Uh, slice of each, right?
[Clyde] Yeah, well played.
Okay, so this is weird.
You know all this stuff about me, and I don't know anything about you.
There you go. One of each.
-You made this? -Well, I didn't buy it.
-You guys good? -[chuckles] Yeah, all good.
-All right. Enjoy. -Thanks, dude.
Told you I'd make it up to you.
You just won again. [chuckles]
What are you, some kind of Connect Four hustler?
Beginner's luck.
But it is fun. I gotta remember to do stuff like this more often.
What? Annihilate the competition in board games?
Not specifically, but yeah, like… like kid stuff.
Kid stuff? [chuckles] What does that mean?
I don't know. Like… like stuff you read about in books.
Food fights, trespassing…
Classic indoor kid, huh?
More like my mom wasn't really interested in any of that.
Can I let you in on a secret?
Nobody's having food fights with their mom.
I know, I mean… [chuckles] I mean, she wasn't interested in any of that for me.
She made it sound silly or something.
Okay, just to be clear,
you've never been trespassing or had a food fight, but, like,
you do know how to ride a bike, right?
Yes, everyone knows how to ride a bike.
Just checking.
So, thanks for showing me the secret pie shop,
random Colby bike guy who appears in the mist.
What?
You never told me your name.
-I didn't? -No.
Oh.
I'm Eli.
Nice to meet you, Eli.
You too.
Would you maybe wanna hang out again?
-Why, you need a kid-stuff guru? -What? No. Never mind.
Wait, wait. Sor-- [chuckles] I'm sorry. I'm kidding.
I mean, I'm kidding, but I'm serious.
Just thinking about what you said, and I think you should do it.
Do what?
Think of a bunch of stuff you haven't done, and just start doing 'em.
It could be, uh, like a quest.
-A quest? -Yeah, yeah.
That sounds ridiculous.
-What? What is ridiculous about it? -[laughs]
I don't know.
I tried to be a different person once this summer, and it was comically bad.
Yeah? Did it happen at the Tip?
Why do you ask?
In my experience,
most comically bad scenarios take place at the Tip.
I mean, with a name like that…
-How could they not? -Yeah.
Uh, I'm just up here.
Will you think about it? The quest?
You seem awfully invested in my life for a stranger, Eli.
I already told you. Nobody's a stranger in Colby.
See you later, Vertical Checkers.
[Auden] It's after two. Go to bed.
[whispers] I can't. If I put her down, she'll just start screaming.
[whispers] Give her to me.
[Heidi whispers] Are you sure?
[whispers] Yeah. I never go to bed this early. I want to.
-[whispers] Okay. -[Auden whispers] Yeah.
[whispers] Oh, do you wanna see Auden?
-You wanna see, Thisbe? -[Auden whispers] Hi, Thisbe.
-[Auden whispers] Hey. Hi. -Oh.
[whispers] Who were you out with so late?
[whispers] No one.
[whispers] Okay. No one.
[whispers] I'm glad you're making friends.
[whispers] Thanks.
[whispers] Can I tell you a secret?
[whispers] It's not so bad here.
Yo, Leah.
[Esther] Thank you for shopping at Clementine's.
Did you get snacks?
Eli's covering front of shop so Adam could do snack run at Gas Gro.
[Esther] Really? I thought Eli never left the workshop.
Do you think if I tell Adam Maggie wants chips, he'll go back?
I'm in a savory mood.
[Maggie] Stop. He was just being nice.
Dude, are you okay?
Uh… Oh, yeah. I… I was just… receipts.
And, uh, did… did you say "Eli"?
Yes. Why?
So you, like, know him?
I think the real question is, how do you know him?
I don't. I… I mean, I've… I've met him.
[Leah] Define "met."
I should get back to work.
[Leah] Damn! Jake and Eli? Talk about a low-key playa.
Nothing's going on with her and Eli.
How do you know?
Think about it. When was the last time he had something going on with anyone?
Before Abe.
[Maggie] Exactly.
You busy?
[Auden] Mini-golf?
Is this your way of trying to spoon-feed me the quest?
Yes, Vertical Checkers. That is a fun conspiracy.
-Hi. Two, please. -[Auden laughs]
-[Eli] Ever been go-karting? -[Auden] No.
-[Eli] Skydiving? No. -[Auden] No.
-[Eli] Bowling? -[Auden] Yes.
-Okay. -I have.
Yeah, how sick.
-[Eli] Did you go to prom? -[Auden] No.
[Eli] Why not?
I guess I'm just not one of those people who thought high school is supposed to be
this, like, big party.
I was more interested in working hard so the rest of my life could be great.
Okay, but come on. I mean, even the kids who hate high school still go to prom,
unless, uh, you're too cool for it, which is the vibe I'm getting from you.
It's not that.
[chuckles] It's, I guess, um, I got stood up.
Oh God. I'm sorry. That's terrible.
No. Oh my God. Please don't feel bad.
I was supposed to go with this guy, Jason. He was just like a lab partner.
It was a friends' thing. And… Well, he got invited to a conference at Duke, so…
It was, like, so not a big deal. I couldn't care less about prom.
Really? Are you sure?
Okay, fine. Uh, maybe the one thing that sucked a little was the dress.
-The dress? -Yeah.
I was downtown one day, going to used bookstores,
and I wandered into this store,
and there was this dress on a mannequin that was just, like, so cool.
You know, if I regret anything, it's not being able to wear the dress.
But prom itself? Yeah, pass.
Did you bring it to Colby with you? No.
No? Where would I wear something like that here?
[chuckles] Anywhere. What?
Yeah, wear it to, uh, skip rocks.
Wear it to drink Cokes.
I mean, it doesn't matter where you wear it
if it's about the dress, right?
I guess.
You know, it's a shame you didn't bring that dress
because it would have been perfect for the quest.
Eli, we're not doing the quest.
[chuckles] Oh, Auden. Of course we are.
What about you? We've been talking about me this whole time.
[Eli] Yeah, well, that's because you're a lot more interesting than I am.
Stop deflecting. Your turn.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel like all I've ever done is goof off.
I even made a career out of it.
-I mean, for a minute. -How'd you do that?
Just, uh, bike stuff. Whatever.
You know, now it's like, what does it all add up to?
Just, uh, some grainy clips on YouTube? Bunch of stupid stories?
I think that everyone deserves a do-over if they want it.
You know? Wish I could have a do-over.
A do-over for what?
You, uh… You didn't win, but it's a very respectable performance,
I will say.
Can I keep it?
Just in case anyone ever asks if I've played mini-golf,
it'd be good to have proof.
'Course. Yeah, gotta have proof.
I hate when it rains.
-Can't be a beach day every day. -Why not?
I'll go get the ponchos.
-Sorry, the ponchos are back here. -Oh. I can get them.
Oh my God. These are awful.
[Maggie] When you say stuff like that, you act like you're speaking for everyone,
when really, you're only speaking for yourself.
Oh, I…
You're right. Sorry.
[Leah] Auden, you have a visitor.
Mom. Hi.
Auden. Hello. [chuckles]
Can we help you find something?
I'm gonna wait for you outside.
Here.
I know what you're gonna say, but come on, you'll get soaked.
Thanks.
Have you sampled the local cuisine?
-What? -Where would you like to have lunch?
Um, there's a place on the boardwalk with good onion rings.
How charming.
So,
how's it going? Bonding with your father?
Good. I mean, he's kind of busy.
He's just working really hard.
The thing about your father is, uh, he enjoys the performance of working
arguably more than he does the actual work.
And Heidi?
Heidi's nice.
Of course she's nice.
Women like her are always nice.
They have to be. It's part of the job description. [laughs]
Poor thing. She must be exhausted, caring for the infant all by herself.
Dad helps.
Auden, who do you think you're talking to?
Oh! That's quite the raincoat. -[laughs] -Okay. Just say it, Mom.
Say what?
Whatever it is you wanna say.
You'll have to forgive me if I find it alarming
how easily you've adapted to the world of your father's new wife.
That's insane. I'm… I'm exactly the same as I've always been.
Look, sweetheart. I realize that you're doing soul-searching,
and that's fine. It's normal, even.
Just don't let this little break from reality come at a cost.
Your classmates from Defriese are not spending the summer hawking thongs
and doing keg stands.
I'm not doing keg stands, Mom.
We'll see.
[Maggie] Hey.
Maggie, hi.
Your mom's kind of intense, huh?
Yeah, you could say that.
She's a legend as a professor, but it must be hard to be her daughter.
You know who my mom is?
Of course. I almost went to the U just so I could take her classes.
But I couldn't turn down Defriese. You're going to Defriese?
I'm going to Defriese.
[chuckles] I know. Heidi told me.
I'm starting to understand why,
when you saw me, you thought, "Wow, I hate her."
Actually, when I first saw you, I thought,
"I'm so depressed that cool, hot girl's hooking up with my boyfriend."
-Yeah. -I didn't form an opinion until later.
Fair. That is fair.
But what wasn't fair was being so hard on you about the Jake stuff.
I mean, you didn't even know me.
Yeah, but I still feel bad.
It's okay. He's a tool.
I'm not gonna say anything. [Maggie laughs] It's okay. I've come to accept it.
But at least he's, you know, a hot one.
I'll give you that. He's… he's a hot tool.
Okay, come on. I promised Heidi I would show you around,
and I've been delinquent with my responsibilities.
Esther and Leah are sitting up there if you wanna head over.
-Where are you going? -I'll be up in a bit.
-Hey. -[Auden] Hey.
She roped you into this too?
No worse than when you roped us into going to Ossify
to watch that guy recite his shopping list over a drumbeat.
Why did Maggie wanna come here?
Why do you think?
Is she into one of those guys?
[Esther] You'll see.
Wait, what?
What's happening?
This… this is a joke. You guys are playing a joke on me.
She's…
This is… this is Maggie.
-This is Maggie. -I know. We've seen this before.
Do all people who do BMX have two little assistants like that?
-Absolutely not. -No, just Maggie.
Whoa.
-I never get to go to Tally Ho. -What are you talking about?
But I just have to sit here all the time.
It's not fair.
But this is so much cooler.
-Have you been to Tally Ho? -No, no.
Okay, then you don't know what you're talking about.
No.
-I think it was better last week. -She was up really late last night.
Maggie, I love you.
Stop.
I love her.
[Maggie] What'd you think?
Maggie, are you kidding me? Who are you?
Mm, a few months ago, I thought, "Why should guys have all the fun?"
-And now we have to come here every week. -Really?
Oh, yo, yo, yo. Conch House party tonight. Bring supplies.
-[Leah] Okay, everyone give me ten. -[Esther groans]
[Maggie] This is for me and Auden. Get snacks too.
[Leah] Okay, but Auden's coming in too 'cause she looks the oldest.
So, what's your snack profile?
Maggie likes sour gummy bears. Cute, but with an edge, like she is.
Esther wants jerky 'cause she's a contrarian.
I'm a traditionalist and usually get a Snickers.
-What about you? -I'll have a coffee, I guess.
A coffee? No.
You need something with snack bang.
Like, what if we end up at the Tip later, and you're starving?
It's not like you can get food at the Tip.
Okay.
How about this?
Old school, but I like it.
Okay.
Ugh, no. No more No Age. Put on something fun.
Let's let Auden DJ.
I bet she has good taste.

[Leah] The Conch House doesn't know what's about to hit it. -[Maggie] These four girls pulling up. -[all laugh]
Anything like the last time…
Wallace, he jumped off the second story into that kiddie pool, remember?
-[Maggie] Yes. -[Esther] You tried to steal a dog.
[Leah] Okay, I know. That was a wild night.
Are Jason and Carlos gonna be here?
Are you embarrassed?
How do you know these people?
Well, we don't know all of them. Some we grew up with.
Some are alums who come home for the summer.
Some Eastern Europeans who come work at the restaurants during our busy season.
Why Eastern Europeans?
I don't know. It's just always been like that.
Speaking of which…
Yeah, I'm from Colby. Where'd you say you're from? Uh, Latvia?
-How long was that drive? -[laughs]
I don't understand why he feels the need to declare himself unofficial ambassador of Colby to every new girl in town.
unofficial ambassador of Colby to every new girl in town.
Oh, no offense.
-No. It's okay. -[Leah] Come on. We don't need to watch. Let's just go.
[Maggie] Come on.
-Let's go this way and get away from him. -Yeah.
Hey, Maggie, up here. Hey, hey.
Dude. Dude, calm down. We saw her an hour ago.
So what? I'm just saying hi.
[Auden] She's really good.
She is, but it loses its appeal when they do the same song at every party.
So, Eli…
Oh, I was waiting for this one.
I'm just curious because we're kind of friends.
Never mind. Unless you think he might come tonight?
[Maggie] You wish.
He never comes to stuff like this.
Not anymore, at least.
Not since Abe.
Abe. Right.
-Has he told you about Abe? -Yeah.
No.
Okay. So Abe was Eli's best friend.
Eli and Abe both did street BMX.
Probably because that's what Clyde was most into, and they both idolize him.
But anyway, they were amazing.
Both sponsored, won crazy competitions, in a league of their own.
Everyone thought that after they graduated,
they would move to, like, Barcelona or Berlin.
One of those European cities with great streets for riding.
Is that what Abe did?
No.
Abe died.
He and Eli had gone to New York for the weekend for this big invitational.
On their way home, only, like, 20 miles outside of Colby,
a drunk driver hit them.
Eli was driving.
After the funeral, he totally shut down. Now he's like a ghost.
Gave up his sponsorship, stopped riding.
Works in the back of a shop doing repairs and never hangs anymore.
Which is why it was so surprising to us when he started hanging out with you.
[woman in movie] Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.s?
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist.
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist. -[Westley grunts] -[animal snarling]
[chuckles] All right. Check these guys out.
I love this part.
What?
-[woman in movie] Westley! -You hate it?
No, giant rats are cool.
Okay, hold on.
So what was your favorite movie in the fourth grade? The Piano?
No.
-[chuckles] -I don't know.
I liked Bye Bye Birdie.
Did you? Bye Bye Birdie the musical?
It's for kids.
[laughs] Yeah. -Yeah, kids born in 1960. -[laughs]
What about you busting out the Jane Campion reference?
My mom would be so proud of you.
Yeah, well, when you don't sleep, you watch a lot of movies.
-And eat a lot of pie… -Mm-hmm. -…drink a lot of coffee… -[chuckles]
Two nocturnes. Guess that's why we're pals.
Pals.
But seriously, why don't you sleep?
I'm just a night owl, I guess, you know? What about you? Same question.
Same answer. Nocturne, night owl.
Nah. You have a story. I can tell.
If I had to pull it down, I guess it's that when my parents were still married,
they used to wait for me to fall asleep before they would start fighting.
And I thought if I didn't fall asleep, they can't fight.
I mean, I was wrong, obviously.
I'm sorry. That's…
No, please don't be.
I'm not like one of those kids who's defined by her parents' divorce.
If anything, my life was probably better because they got divorced.
Whose parents are still married anyway?
Mine are.
Right.
But I mean, I'm sure you had other stuff to deal with.
Hi, what's up, everybody? Um, my name's Eli Stock.
That doesn't matter. You don't need to know who I am.
You know who this is right here. Your boy Abe.
-You know him as Abeonimable. -Abeominable.
-[Abe] Yes, sir. -[laughs]
[Eli] Did you do the 360 bar today?
[Abe] Yeah, did a 360 bar, aka Truck Driver.
-[Eli] First try too. Nice, homie. -[Abe] First try.
-Almost flipped the pedal, but I saved it. -[Eli] You always fall first try.
[Abe] Always. Yeah, man, what's up with that? -Get out of here, bro. -[Eli laughing]
-What? I don't even fall half the time. -Hey, be sure to check my boy out, okay?
All right? He's, like, my best friend.
-[Abe] Yeah. -[Eli] His hair is disgusting. He's never washed it a single time.
He's my homeboy. He's so cute.
Big Abe, stop playing, man. Stop playing. -[both laugh] -[computer lid slams shut]
Hey, everything okay? Do you need anything?
I'm trying to get her to take a bottle so your dad can help with feedings.
Hey, babe, I think she'll take this more easily from you.
When I'm here, she just… she just wants the boob. [chuckles]
Oh, honey, I wish I could, but I was gonna take Auden to lunch.
-What? -Today?
Yeah. Aren't you the one that said we should spend time together?
-Yeah, but I mean-- -So, what do you say?
-Shrimp basket? -Um…
Great. [chuckles]
-Great. -Okay.
All right.
[Auden] Do you think it's okay we left just like that?
Heidi seemed a little, like, strung out.
No, she's fine. I think that's just what new motherhood looks like.
Was it like that for you and Mom?
No, your… your mother and Heidi are completely different.
As far as I can tell, all women go nuts with a newborn.
But men don't?
I think that's why she's frustrated about the book.
It's like I told her when she said she wanted to get pregnant.
I only have these three months before classes start to get it finished.
We just gotta put our head down and get through it.
Yeah. How is it coming along?
[Robert] It's grueling.
Very painful, difficult, but beautiful too.
As you know from Narwhal, a lot of my work deals with
undiscovered trauma that we carry from our parents.
Auden, you're so lucky you don't have that to deal with, at least not from me.
Right.
Hey, um, you know, I'd love it if you read the draft.
You want me to do that?
Yeah, it'd be great to have a young person's perspective.
You know how youth-obsessed our culture is these days.
You just brought that with you to lunch?
-I mean, a brilliant young person… -[Auden] Right.
Of course. I carry it with me everywhere. You think you can read it?
Yeah. I mean, of course. I'd love to, Dad.
[Robert] Excellent.
If you can get me notes by Friday, that would be really great.
-My dad's book. -Looks long.
Three years ago, I would have been so excited to have him trust me with it,
but I just realized I have absolutely no desire to read this.
My dad's always trying to get me to go fishing with him.
My dad would probably use me as bait.
Don't forget to dance at 6:00, okay?
Come on.
I'm just gonna watch.
Oh, she wants to watch. Progress.
[Auden] Hi.
[Eli] Hi. This is a surprise.
I wanna do it for real.
I wanna do the quest.
-[Auden giggles] -[Eli] Come on.
-[Auden] Oh my God. -[Eli] Come on!
-[Eli] You good? -[both laugh]
[Eli] Okay, ready?
-Okay, right there. Go, go, go. -Okay.
[Auden] Wow. ♪ One day I'll be calm And I'll learn to concede ♪
So… we crossed trespassing off the list.
You ever been night swimming?
Maybe trespassing is enough for one night.
[chuckles] Okay.
Um, thanks. That was fun. Yeah.
Next time, we should, uh, teach you how to ride a bike.
I already told you, I know how to ride a bike.
Mm-hmm. You sure?
Yes. My dad taught me as all children's fathers teach them.
I'm not even trying to make it a whole thing.
I'm just saying that if for whatever reason you don't know,
you know, family stuff or whatever, you should really learn.
It's like the… It's the best.
Thank you. But no, that's not on my quest list.
But maybe it's on yours?
Seriously, what would be on your quest list?
I used to wanna move to Barcelona.
Uh, but that's never gonna happen.
Why not?
I only wanted to go because a bunch of pro BMXers live out there.
Pro BMXers like you?
Isn't that what you told me before? That you made a career out of bike stuff?
Yeah. Yeah, but, you know, I'm retired.
-You're retired? -Yeah.
At 20?
I mean, look, the pro scene, and the traveling for competitions,
and putting it all out there just doesn't interest me anymore.
You know? I kind of grew out of it. I fix bikes now.
I don't need to ride 'em.
But you do ride them.
Uh, this is your house.
[chuckles] Yes, it is.
-Okay, thank you. -Yeah.
-Okay, good night. -[both laugh]

Stop! No, no, no, no! Oh my God!

-[Eli] Here he comes. -[Auden laughing]
Auden, hey, hey, hey. Are you okay? -Auden, are you okay? Auden, hey. -[laughing]
That was so good.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Is everything okay?
[sniffles] I'm sorry. That was stupid.
Eli, is… is there something you wanna talk about?
No, no. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Oh, good, you're here. We need to have an intervention.
You sneak out of here every night to go hang out with Eli,
and you never tell us anything about it.
That's not true.
[Leah] The bare minimum, that's what we get from you.
We have no deets. A girl can't live without deets.
I'm sorry, Leah. I don't know what you want me to tell you.
We're friends. Are you sure about that?
-[sighs] I don't know. He's confusing. -Okay, see?
This is why you need us
to observe the two of you together and tell you what's going on.
-Where? -[Leah] HDP, tomorrow, for the Fourth.
-HDP? -He'll know what it means.
Yeah, Eli used to love hot dog parties.
Wallace's parents go out of town every year on the Fourth,
and we take over their house.
We didn't come up with the name, which I'll grant you is terrible.
The name doesn't matter. What matters is you showing up with Eli
so that, as your friends, we can assess the situation.
Can I admit something to you guys?
I've never really had friends like this before.
See, you say that, but I don't get it.
I mean, there were people at our school way more awkward than you,
and even they had friends.
-[Auden chuckles] -I mean, look at Esther.
She says that because she lives in fear of the day I realize I'm too cool for her.
Oh, yeah, because wearing fishnet stockings as arm warmers is so cool.
-I did that one time, and I stand by it. -[Maggie] Guys.
Auden. Focus.
You were saying? I don't know.
If I'm being honest, maybe without realizing it,
I think I push people away.
I think sometimes I come off as a little intense.
What?
We're not laughing at you. It's just that it makes so much sense.
Like how you were standoffish at first. We thought you hated us.
-Hey. -Hi.
-What's up? -Oh…
You're good. It's not gonna hit you. Come here.
So I have a request for the quest.
A request for the quest? [laughs] Amazing. Lay it on me.
HDP.
Eli…
Sorry. Uh, I just… It's nothing personal.
Um, I just don't like parties.
[Auden] Anymore you mean?
You don't like them anymore?
Uh, you know about Abe.
-You were offering me pity friendship. -What? No, no, Eli.
What happened to Abe, it… it wasn't your fault.
It wasn't my fault?
-It wasn't, and I-- -Hold on. Hold on. Are… are you serious?
Auden, do you why know I liked you? You didn't say stupid shit like that.
-What does… what does that even mean? -I didn't say stupid stuff.
Look, I'm sorry. Uh…
You should go to the party and have fun, but I, uh, I can't, so… I'm sorry.
Wait. Eli--
[voice mail] Hi, Auden, it's your mother.
Just calling to check in and see how you're blossoming--
[voice mail] Auden, it's Mom.
I guess I'm to understand that you're very busy
going tanning and getting highlights, but--
[voice mail] Auden, your mother.
I don't know what I did that was so horrible
that you feel the need to ignore me,
but I suppose this break was coming eventually.
It always does. C'est la vie, c'est la vie.
Okay. [squeals] So exciting.
Is it too much to make an American flag out of berries on top of the cheesecake?
-Uh… -Oh my God! I just love the Fourth of July so freaking much!
It's probably my favorite holiday because summer's my favorite season.
Oh, are you coming with, or do you have plans?
-I… I don't-- -I will not be offended if you have plans.
I didn't wanna hang out with my parents when I was 18. Obviously.
-Well, there is a party. -[Heidi gasps] Oh my God.
Do you wanna borrow something festive? Hi, Heidi, it's me, your stepdaughter, Auden.
[tongue clicks] Well, I may have laid something out on your bed already.
Oh God.
Don't be scared. I know you.
Oh no.
[tongue clicks] Auden, you're a firework, baby.
Hey, guys. Cala's been texting me exclusively in haikus.
What do you think this means? "Meat? I'm a vegan."
"Don't your friends shave their armpits?"
"My AC works fine."
I don't think it's that hard to decipher. She's not coming.
-Do you not shave your armpits? -[laughs] Yo, Auden, over here.
-[Leah] Uh-oh, no Eli. -Don't make it a thing.
-Hey! -Hi.
-Come on, everyone's outside. -Okay.
-[Maggie chuckles] -[Leah] I'm so glad you came.
Oh, dude, what about the Spin Doctors?
-Huh? -Dude, that's already a band.
Really? No way.
Yeah, dude. "Two Princes." It's a classic. What?
[in English] Okay, how about this?
[in English] Pedal Posse.
[Wallace] That is terrible.
Maggie, hey. Come, sit here.
-[Leah] What's up? -Hey. I need to lay down.
-Please. Make yourself comfortable. -Okay.
Okay, guys. Bike shop name ideas. Go.
I hate when people say "go" when they want you to answer a question.
What's wrong with The Bike Shop?
Oh, that was only supposed to be temporary.
It used to be Clyde's Rides before a hurricane blew the sign down last fall.
-Yeah. -Yo, Dub H, do you believe in aliens?
Uh, me? Yeah. Dub H, like your name.
-You know who W.H. Auden is? -[chuckles] Don't mind her.
She thinks she's the only person who's ever read a book before.
It's chill, but you still need to answer the question.
Um, I think aliens probably do exist, but not in the way we usually think of them.
Yeah, I knew it.
You know what? We need to chill on the bike shop name.
-It'll come to us. I can feel it. -[sighs] Okay.
-It's every party. -I didn't think that was gonna be--
-[Maggie] I told you. -[Adam] It happens every time.
[Maggie] What?
This, uh, seems pretty tame for a hot dog party.
Hey. No, friend, we're just all so happy to see you.
We didn't expect that you were gonna, like, come today.
[splutters] We're glad that you came.
-I mean, we-- And so the-- -Sorry, I thought-- Um…
What he means is you're late.
Oh.
You know what the penalty for lateness is at a hot dog party?
Tell me.
Yo, your girl is loco.
Actually, the rule…
is that the new kid…
…is supposed to bring the beans.
Food fight!
Thanks for, uh, saving me.
-Saving you? -Yeah.
That's presumptuous. I was just doing it for the quest.
Right. Yeah, okay.
Sorry, uh… [clears throat] Sorry about the beans.
-No, you're not. -[laughs] I'm not.
[Wallace] Night swim! [group] Whoo!
Oh my God! Yes, Auden! Yes!
Yeah!
[Auden] Dad?
Auden.
What's with the suitcase?
Uh, Heidi and I need a little time away from one another right now.
You left?
It's temporary.
You left?
Calm down. Just… just have a seat. Let me get you a coffee. God.
What happened?
What happened is, I don't… I don't know.
She's crazy. At least with your mom, when she was upset, I could tell.
With Heidi, one minute you're thinking everything's hunky-dory, and the next,
you're sitting at a coffee shop waiting for a room to be ready at a beach motel.
Come on, Dad. Even I could tell that everything wasn't hunky-dory.
You're a woman. Uh, women are more intuitive.
If one of your characters said that, you would say that was lazy--
Yeah, so I knew she was tense.
And tired? Sure. But this?
Auden, this is something else entirely. She's, like, certifiable.
-I don't know how to handle it. -Whoa. So… so what?
So you're gonna quit?
You're gonna quit on your family, again?
Because it's hard?
Is that what you think I did, Auden? That I… that I quit on you?
I don't know what I think.
The truth is, and I'm telling you because I respect you
and I think you'll understand…
sometimes I wonder whether I was really meant to be a husband
or a father.
You know what, Dad?
I take it back.
I don't think you quit on me.
I think you didn't even try.
Come on.
Come on? Okay.
[Auden] Heidi.
Oh, hi, Auden.
It's… it's nothing, really.
Yesterday was the Fourth, you know.
It's a holiday. [laughs]
[sobs] And holidays are for families.
When you're married, and you have a baby…
…you do that stuff, you know?
You go to the barbecue.
But then he says, "You're always talking about how tired you are…
…and now you wanna go to a party?" And I said something like,
"I have given you the whole summer off from being a father."
"All I'm asking for is one fucking picnic."
And I just…
It's just too much, you know?
It's all just a little too much.
I'll be right back.
-[mother] Hello? -Hi, Mom. It's me.
I need your help.
[Eli] Hey. There you are.
[Auden] Hi.
What are you doing here?
You disappeared. So I thought I'd come find you.
-Oh, yeah. -[both chuckle]
I'm sorry.
I, uh… I went to get us coffees and then I…
Uh… I don't know.
Whose bike is that?
-You mean this bike here? -Yeah.
It's yours.
-What? -Yeah.
It's yours. I just fixed it up for you. It's in great condition.
It's a beach cruiser, so it's, like, super simple to learn on.
Well, we've been over this.
I don't need to learn how to ride a bike.
-I know how to ride a bike. -Great.
That's even better. Then we can just go for a ride.
I'm not in the mood to do that right now.
How about this? [tongue clicks] If you know how to ride, show me.
It'll be fun. I promise.
Well, this doesn't feel fun. This feels like a… like a weird test.
Auden, you don't have to be embarrassed.
Oh, I'm not embarrassed.
I'm frustrated that you keep harassing me about this stupid bike.
[Eli] Hey, what's up with you?
Did you ever think that it might make me feel like, I don't know,
like a damaged loser?
That I can't do this thing that most kids' dads taught them
when they were five?
Auden, I thought that was the whole point.
To humiliate me?
No, obviously-- No, to do the quest.
Eli, come on, the quest isn't real.
The quest… It's a joke. It's…
Just like this summer, you've been pushing me to be this whole new version of myself.
-But you're too scared to be who you are. -Okay, and who am I, Auden?
Who exactly do you think I am?
You tell me. Are… are you gonna be someone who ambles around Colby,
Are… are you gonna be someone who ambles around Colby,
working in the back of a bike shop?
[Eli] Ambles around, okay.
Or are you going to ride professionally again, or move to Europe,
or go to Barcelona?
-That's what you were saying. -I think I'm understanding you perfectly.
I get it.
What… what do you get? I don't understand.
Uh, let's see. Colby sucks.
-And Auden West is too good for Colby. -That's not fair.
And now you're freaking out because last night,
you… you spent the whole night with some washed-up loser
who isn't even worthy of you. I got you.
You know, every time we try and talk about you, you turn it back on me.
-Why do you think that is? -I think you're the one with the problem.
-I'm the one with the problem? -Yeah.
Do you really think Abe would have wanted you to quit?
I'm not talking about that with you.
Yep, fine. Deflect.
You know, I have enough of my own stuff to deal with right now.
I can't also be the thing you use to avoid thinking about yourself.
I'm not Abe, Eli. I can't be your do-over.
You're right.
You can't.
[Heidi] But it's just so hard for me 'cause I don't have a lot of help,
and it's totally stupid.
-You've been saying that. -Oh, honey, you're not stupid.
You're very intelligent. I just would like to ask you,
what makes you think that his needs are more important than yours?
It's a… it's a powerful thing that you've done,
to stand up to him and… and to say, "I… I deserve better."
-[Heidi] Yeah. -[mother] You know, and that's motherhood.
-That means so much to me. -[laughs] Really, you have no idea. [sniffles, chuckles]
[Auden] Is Heidi okay?
I think so. Your father came home, and they're talking.
Oh. Um, well, that's good.
I don't know what you said to him, Auden, but whatever it was, he heard you.
-He told you that? -Mm-hmm.
You guys talked about it? About me?
Look, Auden, I, uh… I need to talk to you.
I know you went through a lot with the divorce.
And perhaps…
I relied on you too much. I expected too much of you.
But I liked that you expected a lot of me.
I expected a lot of myself.
[mother] I don't mean that, sweetheart.
I mean… that I expected you to always be mine.
That I wouldn't have to share you, and that's not fair.
When you came down here,
I felt like you didn't need me anymore.
And to be blunt,
I was jealous.
I'll always need you, Mom.
I just need other people too.
Of course you do.
[Auden] I guess… I just wish that some things had been easier.
Me too. [laughs]
Oh God. [laughs]
[Auden] Aw, Mom.
-Hello? -[footsteps approaching]
-[tongue clicks] Oh, hi. -[Auden] Hi.
You did yoga?
Wow. Where's Thisbe?
[Heidi's tongue clicks] Your dad took her for a walk on the beach.
Said it was a great way for him to clear his head.
-Wow. -[chuckles]
Yeah.
Hey. I never got the chance to thank you for asking your mom to come out here.
Oh, I thought you might be mad at me.
No. [chuckles] No, honey. Not at all.
Actually, it was because of her
that your dad and I had the most honest conversation that we've had in months.
It's funny, isn't it? You look at your life, and you think,
one decision, and it all would have been different.
You mean, this stuff with my dad?
Actually, I was thinking about if I never moved back from New York.
You lived in New York? [laughs] Yeah, I did.
After business school.
I was gonna open up a boutique there on the Lower East Side,
but I decided I would wait
until something came on the market that I truly loved.
And it did. Clementine's.
So you chose Colby over New York,
and you don't, like, regret it at all?
Life is long, Auden.
It'd be boring if we had to stay
the same versions of ourselves the whole time. Don't you think?
-Yeah. -[both chuckle]
[Maggie] Are you sure I'm the one you want to teach you how to do this?
I'm sure. This is about me.
-[Auden] Yeah, you got me? -[Maggie] Yeah, I got you.
Almost there. You got it.
-[Maggie] You got it. -[Auden] No.
Really, really good job.
-[Auden] No, it wasn't. -Yes, it was. You got so far.
-Okay. Okay, you got it. -Okay.
Almost there. Okay, go.
-Ready. -So, ready? There we go. -You got it. There you go. -[Auden] No, no.
And go!
Okay. Again.
You got it. You got it!
You got it!
I'm doing it.
Oh, I see it.
-I'm really doing it. Do you see me? -[Maggie] I see it.
Oh, Auden, watch out.
-Hello? -[Maggie] You're not gonna believe this.
[announcer] Next up, one of our favorites is here to make a comeback.
We haven't seen this rider in over 18 months.
[exhales] Come on, come on, come on.
[announcer] Eli Stock!
-[crowd cheering] -[announcer] Let's go!
[Adam] Can we talk about that double tailwhip? [Wallace] That was insane.
-You saw the smile. -I saw the smile.
-You saw the smile. -She saw the smile.
-Go talk to him. -He didn't invite me here, so…
He didn't invite anyone! [Leah] Who was invited? There was no invite.
I guess.
-[Maggie] Why aren't you over there? -[Leah] What are you doing? Talk to him.
[Maggie] Just go talk to him.
Okay, but what if he thinks it's weird that I'm here?
Oh yeah. 'Cause guys hate when girls they like show up to watch them win.
-[Maggie] Go! -[Leah] Can you go already?
-Okay, okay, okay, okay. -So go.
-Go get your butt over there now! Go! -Go on!.
-[Leah] Go! -I'm going. [Wallace] Bro, are you serious?
[Eli] Yeah.
-Hi. -[Eli] Hey.
-[Adam] Hey. -[Wallace] Hi.
You were, um, so good.
[chuckles] Thanks. Thank you. Um, do you wanna talk over here, maybe?
Um, do you wanna talk over here, maybe? Yeah.
[Auden] Yeah.
-[Auden] So, Eli. -[Eli] So, Auden.
Sorry. [laughs] You… you go first.
I'm really sorry about what I said the other day. I didn't mean it.
You did, but It's okay. You know, I needed to hear it.
Look.
I miss the hell out of Abe.
I thought that if I stopped thinking about it and…
if I gave up doing all the things he loved that it would just go away,
but it only made it worse
'cause, you know… …all the things he loved were the things I loved too.
He was just the best, man.
I loved that kid so much.
I wish you two could have met. He would have loved you.
So do I.
And I'm… I'm sorry too.
You know, if I pressured you into doing anything you didn't wanna do--
Oh, no, no, no. I…
I wanted to do everything I did.
Okay, good.
[Auden] That morning, me freaking out,
it wasn't about you, or us, or the night before.
It was just some stuff with my parents.
Turns out I'm not as over all of it as I thought.
It's okay. I get it.
Okay, well, enjoy tonight.
-You earned it. -Thanks.
[Heidi] You know, it's the craziest thing.
Both my girls slept through the night.
[Robert] Auden, do you know anything about that boy on our lawn in a tuxedo?
Oh. Hey.
Hey yourself.
You know, we, uh, came up with a new name for the bike shop.
"Abe's Bikes." What do you think?
I love it.
Okay, good, 'cause you gave me the idea, so…
Nice tux.
-Oh, this old thing? -[laughs]
Where you goin' all dressed up?
I don't know. I was thinking maybe I'd skip rocks, drink Cokes.
Why, is that something you'd be interested in?
I mean, I'd love to, but I don't have anything to wear.
Right.
It's a real shame you didn't bring that dress to Colby with you.
Give me ten minutes.
[Eli clears throat] Wow.
-[chuckles] -[Eli chuckles] Wow.
-[Eli] So this is it, huh? -Yeah.
Aw, you guys look so great.
-Wow, you really look pretty. -[Auden] Thanks.
-[Robert] Auden does too. -Thanks, Dad.
Now you guys don't stay out too late.
Dad, who do you think you're talking to?
-Hmm, I don't get it. -Okay, come on.
-Bye, guys. -[Auden chuckles]
All right. Come on. I'm parked over here.
Actually, I got a better idea.
-Really? -Mm-hmm.
-[Eli] You look good on it. -[Auden] Thank you very much.
-I've been working on it. -Yeah?
[Eli] Oh wow. Going quite fast.
[Auden] Look at this.
-[Auden] Hey! -[Eli] You gonna pop a wheelie?
-[Auden] Absolutely not. Are you? -[laughs]
[Eli] I don't know if I can. Maybe.
-[Eli] What else you got planned for us? -[Auden] Me? This is your rodeo.
-Rodeo? -Yeah.
-Do I look like a cowboy to you? -A little.
[Auden] Okay. Ready?
-That was horrible. -Well, we should really be at a lake.
So are you sure you don't miss the prom part?
Well, okay.
Today aside, maybe I was a little hard on prom.
Maybe there's something nice about getting dressed up
and dancing with your friends to mark the end of something.
[Maggie] I'm so glad to hear you say that.
-Hey! -[girls laugh]
Wait, what's going on?
When Eli told us about his plan, I said, "Are you kidding?"
"If my friend has never been to prom, she's gonna get a real one."
The theme is Beach Bash.
We thought it was best to work with what we had.
Is this for real?
Do you hate it?
I so don't hate it.
[Maggie] Hello?
-[laughs] -Oh!
[Auden] Thank you.
All right, just 'cause you're the catalyst of this thing
doesn't mean you don't have to help. Get to work.
[Eli] Dear Vertical Checkers, I miss you already.
You'd love it here. It's so beautiful.
The streets are perfect for riding, and they sleep during the day.
Don't let the quest end just because you have homework now.
-Bueno suerte, mi amor. Love, Eli. -[music ends]
[Maggie] Okay, you have read it five times.
The winner will be the king of Istanbul!
To my right, Ronaldinho from the South!
And to my left, holding the Istanbul Championship title for two years
Hezarfen Ahmet Celebi!
The bird performing the most tumbles in a single throw wins.
Place your bets!
Final bets!
-Are we ready? -We're ready!
First up, Ronaldhino!
-Come on! -One!
-Come on! -Two!
-Three! -Come on!
Three tumbles by Ronaldhino!
Next up is Hezarfen!
One!
Two! Three!
Four!
Five!
Hezarfen wins!
That's it. The king of birds.
That's my boy.
Sir, what shall I do with Ziya?
Bring him in.
-After you. -You're the visitor.
-Greetings, Ziya. -Hello, Mr. Saruhan.
Listen to me.
There was a local amateur league game this week
between Eskin Market Bayir Turban Spor
and Aksay Elektrik Yeknasankoy Spor...
What's up with these weird names?
You bet good money on these games. Is that right?
That's right. What's the matter?
Listen, the situation here is a rather interesting one.
The final score, the scores of the first and second halves,
the scorers, the taker of the first throw-in,
the first corner kick-- motherfucker, the first heartbeat--
how come you-- how come you know all that?
Mr. Saruhan, here's the situation. I have this special gift.
How could you know the result of the referee's coin toss?
I didn't even know we took bets on that.
-That's news to me. -It's new. Very popular.
Okay, go on.
I swear on all your dead relatives that it's my gift of prediction.
My friends and acquaintances know all about it.
You know what it's like?
It's a God-given gift.
-A God-given gift, you say? -When something's about to happen, I get--
something happens to me-- a feeling.
-Snap! -Snap?
I get this thing, like a snap, and there.
"Snap"? Snap, he says.
Since you have this ability, Ziya,
you can perhaps guess what will happen now, right?
Of course.
What will we do to you now?
I'd cry more but you won't believe me. Nektar never believed me anyway.
Then you'll give me some time and I'll walk out.
And I'll find the money by tomorrow afternoon...
-and bring it to you. -He really knows.
-Thank you. -Get out.
Nektar, you get out. You stay.
Now, you've guessed it all.
But there's one thing you missed. What's that?
-What could it be? -If one man doesn't pay his debt...
nobody else will.
That's very well said.
Now, take a step back.
Step back.
Is this fine?
-Right. -Don't stare at me. Get lost.
We were just joking.
Oh, my!
-Did you get it, darling? -I got it.
Nazli looks beautiful.
-Come on. -Hold it.
-Welcome! -Hello. Welcome.
-Hello? -Is this Bahadir Temizel?
Yes?
Bahadir, come on!
This is Police Chief Inspector Hasan Barkucu.
Listen to me very carefully.
A serious civic, public and dangerous situation related to you has arisen.
Dangerous? Related to me? How come?
Cooperate with us and we can resolve this.
But I must tell you, this is serious.
But I'm getting married today.
Leave your current location now. Await instructions in a safe place.
And please hurry up!
Hurry! Your account is hacked. We're talking about illegal money traffic.
Okay.
Yes, I can hear you now.
This operation is directed by the DA.
I'm putting you through to his secretary.
Sir, I'm putting you through to the DA.
-Have a nice day. -What? DA?
Mr. Temizel, this is DA Ilhan Gundogan.
A prominent member of a terrorist organization has been captured.
-He had your identity information. -That's impossible, sir.
And I'm at the wedding hall right now.
-I'm getting married. -Sir!
You don't get the gravity of the situation.
You must follow my instructions.
Now, quietly leave your current location
and go out to the nearest main street.
Okay, but why can't I get married first?
Unless you carry out our instructions,
you may face a 36 years-to-life sentence
for being a member of a terrorist organization.
Okay, I'm walking that way.
-Did you withdraw the money? -I did, sir. In cash.
Good. Now, turn left.
Walk without drawing attention.
Walk without drawing attention. I turned left, sir.
My wife is on the other line. Let me explain to her.
Don't do that!
This is a secret operation and you're talking about your wife!
Don't attract attention. I'm telling you, you may face a life sentence.
Okay, sir, I'm walking.
Sir, my battery is almost dead.
Given the importance of the operation,
let me charge it. Let's not compromise anything.
No. Every second counts!
You're being pursued by the terrorists. We must urgently conclude the operation.
-Now turn left. -Okay.
-Walk quickly towards the back. -Yes, sir.
-Now sit on the bench in front of you. -Okay, sir.
-I'm sitting. -Good.
Put the money on the bench and leave as a shootout may ensue any moment.
Yes, sir.
But, sir, I have no money on me. May I take some for the taxi fare?
-He wants the taxi fare. -Let him take it.
No way.
No, sir.
Those bills are marked. Leave the location.
Sir, my battery is almost...
dead.
There's the fish at the tea house.
I'm moving in to rip them off. Wait for my sign. Be ready.
Let's assume we're dividing 1300 by 50.
-Is five smaller than 13? -Of course it is, Dad.
There are two of them. Here is the math.
They're giving us more or less the same price.
No, son. We bargain all the way.
Just grab the guy's arm and shake it until he gives you the price you want.
We're buying iron, Dad, not sheep.
It was an example, you idiot.
-Are those my guys? -Where's my hundred?
Have a nice day.
Hello, Tutku. What did the boss say?
Why should we keep out surplus iron?
The storage is costly, just sell it.
Someone much more important is calling on the other line, I must hang up.
Nobody is calling, actually, I said that just to hang up.
-Sorry? -As a joke, Dad.
The gentleman hung up sarcastically to dismiss the person on the other end.
-Right. -Well said.
I couldn't have put it so well myself.
You described it so well.
Semih Erken from Bezirgan Construction.
-Ihsan Kulunc. -Semih Erken.
Naim Kulunc.
I'm very sorry. I'm still boiling with anger.
Really? What happened?
All the preparations were done, we were ready to start.
The general director got replaced.
Then came the elections, allowances stopped, we got a one-year deferral.
-That's a shame. -We ended up with tons of goods.
-Right. -I don't mean to meddle,
but it makes no sense to keep the goods for a whole year.
If you'd like to sell, you have a buyer here.
-Right, Dad? -Wait a moment, son.
Don't jump straight in.
The boss isn't selling it anyway. I vote for selling.
I say, rather than 2000 a ton, let's just get rid of it for 1500.
But he won't listen.
Why don't we go and speak to your boss, then?
He'll listen to my dad. Won't he, Dad?
We might be interested if we can get a good discount.
Like... 1300.
-1400. -Deal.
See? I got the discount right away.
Say, "A great deal, Dad!"
Yes. It's a deal, right? Shall we see the boss?
Not today.
The boss likes to spend his Fridays on his boat with his friends,
and doesn't want to be disturbed.
Good thing it's Wednesday.
Wednesday. Right, it's Wednesday.
The boss likes to spend his Wednesdays on his boat with his friends,
and doesn't want to be disturbed under any circumstance. No way.
That's a shame.
If the boss tells me off, I need you to back me up, okay?
-Of course, sir, don't worry. -This is a "doziac," isn't it?
It's called a "Zodiac," Dad.
It has a mechanism that uses inflated air.
I'm not selling it. I can't. I won't.
Sir, don't you always say, "Don't do business
if you can't turn assets to money on time"?
These boys are so good at sniping at me with my own words.
Don't say that.
What was that one the other day, about salmon?
-Salmon? -A friend from Norway
sent me some caviar recently. Red caviar.
I said to him,
"You didn't give me a loaf of bread when I was poor.
I don't need your salmon now."
That's very well said.
Sometimes a piece of dry bread is worth much more
compared to more expensive food. That's what I think you meant.
Well said, son.
You distilled the moral of the story so well.
What's your name, young man?
Naim, sir.
He's my son.
I don't know about him.
Perhaps he's been worn down by age, but the kid is smart.
Give a young entrepreneur like him some rocks,
and he can squeeze them, and sell what comes out as spring water.
This kid will succeed.
-Have you eaten it before? -What, sir?
Salmon caviar.
No, sir. Never had the opportunity. But I've heard about it.
Amazing.
This is what it must be like to be smart, lucky and overweight.
Bring the caviar. I like this kid. Let's make Naim's day!
Give him some caviar to eat and play the music. Turn it up!
Come on!
Come here, Ihsan!
Wonderful... wonderful.
Wonderful. Wonderful.
Naim, as soon as you transfer the money to our account, all the iron is yours.
Right, I'll do it online.
-I'm on it. -Great.
Look, Dad, online banking.
I think...
gold will be the best investment, I think. Am I wrong?
I don't think I can think that you can think something wrong.
Your heart is as beautiful as your appearance, you know that?
Thank you, sweetheart.
You go to this page.
Here's the account number he gave us. Copy. Paste.
-That's where I fail. -Just hold it down.
-There it goes. I've transferred it. -Congratulations.
-Is the transfer done? -Yes. You have it.
Okay, hang up.
If you're ready, I'll count down.
Three, two, one.
FUNDS AVAILABLE IN YOUR ACCOUNT
Here it is.
-Wish you the best. -Bless you.
-Take care, sir. See you. -God bless you.
He's smiling now that he got the discount.
-That's my dad! Bye. -See you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
-Hello, sir. -Hello?
I think there's a problem.
What's the problem?
You haven't sent the money yet, sir.
No way! Of course we have.
Tell him that we transferred the money.
We transferred, sir. See, here's the receipt.
Here is the account number. It's all here.
That's not our number.
-What do you mean? -How come?
-Where's the man who made the order? -Which man?
-Ask him, son. Which man? -Which man?
That young man, Mr. Talip.
Wait a minute. Sir, Mr. Erken came here.
He said this was their account.
We did as he said. We sent the money.
-Who is Mr. Erken? -The young man.
-That is Mr. Talip. -Is Talip young, too?
That's strange.
Hello, Ms. Gulsen.
-What's going on? -They say they sent the money.
But it's not in our account. Can we do...
When he told me to leave the wedding hall, I left,
following the instructions of the DA, I--
Still saying "the DA."
Well, according to the instructions of people
purported to be in the DA's office,
I withdrew the money from the bank.
-And then, at Sirkeci Park-- -Can I please step out?
-Of course. -Thank you.
-Jeweler? -Yes, sir.
It appears that you bought gold, not iron.
No, sir. We bought iron.
-Tell him, son. Say, "We bought iron." -We bought iron, sir, not gold.
You sent the money to a jeweler.
How is that?
You bought gold.
No, sir. We trade in iron.
Why would we buy iron from a jeweler?
Tell him, son, we bought from an iron trader.
Wait a minute, Dad.
This is a well-known trick, it's called "baiting the fish."
They don't use a bank account, they use the jeweler.
Right.
Baiting.
Naim, where is the money?
The men bought gold with it, Dad.
Right. Where is the iron?
The owner took it back.
So where is the gold?
The men ran away with it, Dad.
Which men?
Dad, I'm begging you, stop that!
Those men defrauded us!
You...
you ate the fish poop,
you drank the alcohol,
and you fucked us up.
Son of a gun!
Get out of here! You tube of a boy!
You fat tube!
Where are you going by yourself?
The lawyer didn't sound very hopeful.
We may find the men but there's little chance of finding the money.
Such guys would say they spent the money.
I'll go after them myself if need be.
I'll slap you myself now!
-You'll hit me? -I should have earlier.
Please shut up. You messed up. Be quiet.
Okay, you're right. But I'll fix the mess I've made.
Those jerks will pay me back with interest.
Watch your mouth and shut up! Just stop speaking!
-Okay, darling. -Don't say that either.
-Just shut up completely! -I said okay!
If you had shut up after saying that, I would have, too!
I wouldn't have spoken if you hadn't.
-Saying "I shut up," doesn't mean talking. -Bahadir, enough!
You're shouting at a man who has to shut up.
Still talking.
Pokemon!
Shoot!
That's it!
Blond Saruhan?
That's the man you owe money to?
I called the folks at the village, they won't overdo it next time.
A fixed match should end 2-1. Just get that.
I have a new place. I'll double down the money.
I'll make that money, and I'll pay back my debt to Saruhan.
-There you go. -Or they will fuck you up.
-Exactly. -What?
-Hit it! -I can't get the ball!
-Bravo! -Well done, my brother!
Asim, you have a visitor.
Visitor? And you let them right in?
They're insiders already.
What do you mean?
-Puyol. -Okay.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Can we have a word, Dad?
I wonder how I could have created such a beautiful thing.
I mean, I know it comes from your late mother.
How haven't I spoiled such beauty?
Don't worry. You've spoiled the rest of our lives.
Anyway, I'm not here to talk about that.
-What are you here for? -We're in trouble.
-We've been defrauded. -What?
During the wedding ceremony.
Wedding? What wedding?
My wedding.
You got married?
No, when those men did this--
-What men? -The men who defrauded us.
Tell me now! Who defrauded whom? Marriage? With who?
You know the guys who call people on the phone?
They say, "terrorists hacked your phone" or whatever.
And? You fell for that trick?
Asim Noyan's daughter fell for that trick?
Not me.
-Bahadir did. -Who is Bahadir?
My prospective husband.
Oh, my. Listen to the words coming out of your mouth.
How old is that mouth to be able to say "prospective" and "husband"?
How can you marry without telling your father?
And you're too young, Nazli.
I'm 24, Dad.
That's young!
I came because I have no one to go to.
Will you help us?
-So? -So, I wonder
if you can still talk to your father so coldly after seeing this.
I've written your name on my heart, dear, inside and out.
Help you? I will die for you!
Put your shirt on, Dad.
"Prospective."
-You should've stayed to eat. -I only have two hours off from work.
Don't worry about the money. We'll take care of it.
We've just finished a nice job, but we spent the money,
and the guys are all in debt.
-Give me two weeks. -No, Dad.
We don't want stolen money. We want our own money.
I promised Mom I wouldn't take anything from you.
-He thinks you're a doctor. -Who?
-Bahadir. -You told him so?
You should've said I freelance.
I just made it up when we first met.
Anyway, I'll take care of it.
Listen, Nazli, I know you were very angry with me back then.
And you still are.
But I was there, you know that.
I waited at the hospital for days, they wouldn't let me in.
The boys were even going to steal a liver from another hospital.
But we gave up because your mother would pester us.
You fooled us time after time.
You said you'd quit crime but never did.
You wore my mother down more than the cancer.
Those are terrible words.
Ludvinka, why don't you answer the phone?
Did I dial the wrong code for Bulgaria?
Naim.
-Yes, Dad? -Come here.
-You are... -I am...
-Listen. -Yes.
-A son like... -A son like...?
-A son like you... -Like...
-A son like you... -A son like me, yes...
A son like me? What, Dad?
Mother.
Mother.
Mother. Yes?
-Fuc... -Fuck...
Dad, you're exhausting yourself!
Stop exhausting yourself.
Honey, it didn't work the first time. Why did you insist on having a kid?
To hell with your test tube baby! See, here's the result.
Such harsh words to speak to your own son.
He killed his own twin in the womb.
What an idiot!
You robbed me blind.
This is the result. The half-wit.
-Where are you going? -Never mind. You just rest.
Where are you going, tube boy?
It's not like you asked for my opinion.
There's nothing wrong with test tube babies. Everyone has them.
Hello, buddy. How are you?
Wow, buddy! What brought you here?
I missed you.
They got the gold from the jeweler and got lost.
My dad never hurt me once in my life, and he slapped me on the back of my neck.
I can't believe that, buddy.
I'm like a dead man walking now, buddy.
What?
I said I'm like a dead man walking now.
How can we find these men?
Wait. Don't worry.
I know someone who can help you.
He's our customer, and he's a very nice person,
and he loves our sandwiches. So does everyone else.
Sometimes more people line up than we can serve.
We can't serve them but they line up anyway.
You really think so? Can they really solve my problem?
Of course, it's their job. But I get part of the money.
Sure. It's all for profit, after all.
-Hey, get back to work! -Coming!
-The bread's getting cold. -I'm coming.
I'll have one more. This tastes so good.
Caviar has nothing on this.
Gentlemen, these are the fastest roaches in history!
Usain Bolt was here yesterday. He quit the sport after seeing them.
Place your bets!
What kind of place is this?
Don't worry, I know this place well.
I don't even understand where we are right now.
-Just follow me. -Number one,
number two, three, four, five.
Are you ready?
That's a spooky door.
-Greetings, Unal. -Welcome.
One, two, three, go!
Five makes a good start, ahead of the pack.
Three keeps on running.
Number one turns on the jets!
A great run! Three is coming up from behind.
Number five comes right along. Number three continues.
Almost catching up!
Three is in the lead!
Number three wins!
After a great burst!
-What's this? They're racing roaches? -Yeah. Once a week.
-An extraordinary match. -My goodness.
These are not our traditions. What's this?
I feel sick and weird.
-He thought about this in person. -Does this place smell?
We're starting the second round.
Three, two, one, go!
Enjoy your meal, sir.
We transferred the money when we saw the goods.
How could we have known?
And worse, my dad didn't know I had taken the money from a loan shark.
He thought it was our money.
What happened to your own money?
I spent it pursuing a romance, sir.
She called me from Bulgaria. She said she was in a tough situation.
We started getting along as we talked, but--
I've always wondered who falls for this trick.
This guy.
Oh, boy.
I fell in love with a cruel woman. I spent all the money.
How's your father?
He's not doing good. He's sick in bed.
And he's been berating me with some harsh words.
-Have you complained? -How could I, sir?
He's my father, after all. I try to be patient with him.
He means the police.
When my buddy told me about the matter, I thought I'd bring him to you.
We're at your mercy here, sir.
We'll compensate you for your expenses as soon as we get the money.
Now, it's true that I'm allergic
to robbers, degenerates-- such filthy men.
But I'm absolutely against the kind of violence that involves beating a man
who doesn't deserve a beating.
-Am I right? -Right, sir.
But you do beat a man who deserves it, right?
Of course.
We'll take care of this.
-But I have a request, sandwich man. -Of course. What is it?
I want you to give your friend a heavy slap.
A slap?
-Yes. -Why?
Don't you think a man who has wasted his father's money...
with Bulgarian women deserves a good slap?
-I see. -No.
No. I mean a level higher than that.
It was actually a level below that one, but anyway...
-Why slap me harder than he wanted? -How could I get it just right?
-Come on! -Did it hurt?
When you slap a man that hard, it hurts!
Is the patient's relative nearby?
Is the patient's relative with him? What's so hard to understand?
Take him out.
They secretly feed the patient!
All right.
Hello.
-Nazli, it's good to see you. -Let me kiss your hand.
-Hello. -Hello. Sit down.
Let me introduce you. My father, Dr. Asim.
-Bahadir. -Associate professor, but it's okay.
No problem.
We've finally met. It's a pleasure, sir.
I'm rather surprised, actually,
about my daughter's untimely decision to get married...
without letting me know.
We may have drifted apart for a while but I'm her father, after all.
So I can say this has traumatized me.
Can we get to the actual subject? We don't want to keep you busy.
I believe we are right on the actual subject, my dear.
Sir, I was very curious to meet you.
I'm glad the strife between you is over,
or is at least coming to an end on this occasion.
-How old are you? -Twenty-nine, sir.
Twenty-nine is not an age. That's 30.
You're middle-aged.
You're that old and you fell for a trick that not even a child would fall for.
Law enforcement sends everyone warning messages all the time
to warn people against such fraud.
I delete such bulk messages without reading them.
-If you don't read them, they'll... -Dad!
...rob you blind. They robbed him blind.
If you'd fallen for a better rehearsed, more subtle fraud, I wouldn't have minded.
No need to talk about this.
Say you'll help us and Bahadir will calm down.
He keeps saying he'll go after them.
-Oh, my. -Of course I'll go after them.
I'll get our money back.
They'll see that they've met their match once their match hits them back.
Bahadir, enough.
No. You can't do anything illegal.
If everyone were to do their own punishing, where's the law?
Where's the order? Where?
I have a social circle consisting of people in very high places. She knows.
She doesn't visit me but she knows about my friends.
-You're right. -I know all sorts of people.
The governor, the police commissioner, the private secretary...
human resources.
They're all a phone call away, thank God. They'll do what needs to be done.
They'll prioritize our file.
-We'll take care of it. You just wait. -You see, Bahadir?
It's settled. Dad will take care of it.
Why don't you get a cup of tea? My lips got dry.
Did you drink that or blow into it? I couldn't tell.
It's latte. It's foamy.
It's noisy as well.
Dad.
I'll find those men and I'll get the money back.
Nobody can deceive Asim Noyan's daughter.
You can't "nutmeg" Ronaldo.
I'll take care of this.
But on one condition.
-What's that? -Leave that man.
Don't get married. Especially not to that guy.
He isn't a man to marry. He's a man to con.
It was an awful idea to ask you for help. Forget everything we've said.
I didn't come here to see you.
Didn't you see how he drank the latte? He blew air into it.
You shouldn't be so impulsive at this age.
One can settle every matter by talking.
Bahadir, let's go.
-See you, sir. -Goodbye, Bahadir.
-What happened? -Nothing. Let's go.
Children are the hardest question in life.
Why do daughters grow up? Fathers should get fucking younger.
-Hayri, what's up? -Fine.
We're looking for some phone tricksters.
We have all kinds of shit going on here but I haven't heard of that before.
I see, Tayfun.
-See you around. -Hayri. Why didn't you pay?
Give me some.
GŰLOMBAYIR ASSOCIATION FOR FRIENDSHIP AND SOCIALIZING
Some con men come here, but they do small jobs-- sweepstakes guys.
"You won. Send us 300 TL and get your iPad." That kind of thing.
They ask an easy question on the phone. Like, "What is the square root of 36?"
Is that an easy question?
It's just an example, Pokemon.
Where's this Gűlombayir?
Beats me. You expect the boss to write "Gambling Den"?
-So there's no such place. -No, but we have a lot of townsmen.
-This place is full every day. -Thanks, Sanchez.
-Let us know if you hear anything. -Will do, buddy.
Come on.
Oh. Hello, girls.
-What's up, Damla? -I'm Cagla.
-Asim, how are you? -Fine. You know me.
What about you, honey?
-It's the usual. I work. I go to the gym. -Jim? Who's Jim?
Nobody. I mean, I exercise.
-You're really something. See you around. -See you.
-What? -Honey.
Is it a problem that I don't speak in my mother tongue?
If I see you flirting with sluts again, I'll cut out your tongue.
She's not a slut. She has a BA degree.
-Oh? How do you know that? -How do you know she's a slut?
I didn't see a diploma but I saw her ass.
Wow, look who's here.
What's up, old man?
Like a bullet since the bypass surgery.
They built an expressway through my heart. It's brand new.
I bet not everyone can ride now that it's a toll road.
It wasn't free before either, Lerzan. How are you, pretty eyes?
Your friend is cruising. He calls sluts "honey."
-Asim Noyan did that? I can't believe it. -And your friend here pesters.
I'll go freshen up, "honey."
Sorry.
They hurt my dear Nazli, my friend. I need to find those men.
I read about that on the Internet, Asim. The headline was, "Goofy Groom."
And I thought, "Who's that idiot?" So he was your--?
That's what gets me. Who cares about the robbers?
It turns out I have an idiot for a son-in-law.
So they conned the daughter of the master con man.
And the Internet will be talking about them
when the master gets to them.
The place is looking great.
-Knock on wood, girl. -Of course.
And give me that phone you just grabbed. Let's make the owner's day.
I can't believe you saw that.
I'd like to take a selfie with the grand master.
I quit this game at the top. I advise you two to do the same.
Quit the organized schemes, Asim.
Find something you can make for five bucks and sell for 50. That's it.
I'm confused here. Are you telling us to stop stealing or to keep on?
He's saying, "Cut down on it."
I'll get you some sushi with yogurt. It's the latest trend in town.
What's sushi with yogurt?
So you don't know them?
Look.
This is just the kind of thing that gets on my nerves.
What? Let's say there's this guy.
That guy has some information he doesn't want to tell us.
In such a case...
my brother Nektar wants to resort to violence.
"Let's shoot him, beat him, crush him."
But in fact...
people get along by talking.
I say something nice to you...
you say something nice to me.
And he tells me something nice. You see?
We get faster results when we shoot, that's why.
Sir, I told you. I don't know those men.
They wired the money and we gave them gold.
-Here are the photos. -Give me those.
-Here. These are from the security camera. -Come here.
See if these folks are those folks.
No, sir. I don't know these men.
-You don't know them? -No, sir.
-Call her. -She speaks so coldly to me.
-It's getting on my nerves. -So warm her up.
Tell her you have no conditions. Just say something.
-But I do have conditions. -Okay, I have a better idea.
Fine, call her. Let "the freezer" speak.
-What are you reading? -I'm reading the news, "Goofy Groom."
-Hello? -Nazli? Hello, dear.
It's Lerzan Berrak.
That is, I'm Dr. Asim's wife, Inci.
Oh, hello, Ms. Inci.
-Who's that? -My father's wife.
-Give her my regards. -So how are you?
I'm fine, thanks. How about you?
I'm fine. Listen.
Why don't we all go out for dinner tomorrow?
-Dinner? -Dinner?
I don't know.
Let me first ask Bahadir.
By the way, your dad sends you kisses. And greetings to Mr. Balamir.
-Okay, I'll tell Bahadir. -Oh-- right.
Bahadir.
So I'll send you the place and time right now.
It's going to be great. Kisses.
-That's it. -Well done, "Bahadir."
-Here you go. -Oh, that's nice.
No.
Listen, handsome. You know this guy?
-Hello. -I don't remember seeing him, sir.
-Turn him. -What?
Sir.
Turn him around.
Let him face me. That's it.
Look again now. Do you know this guy?
You don't have to do this. We can talk upright.
Do you know how many coffee boys
suffer concussions after being turned upside down and dropped like that?
I don't know, sir.
None. But you'll be the first.
They defrauded us here in front of you.
And that man spoke to you first when he came in.
I remember now.
-I'll tell. Turn me back. -Blood goes to the brain.
Right. Good. Let him go.
I meant, turn him around and then, let him go.
-To hell with your-- -Sorry, sir.
Why did you do that?
God give me patience.
There's too many appetizers. The main course is still to come.
Just leave the salad. The rest can go.
It's okay. He'll come to his senses. Take away those appetizers.
Thanks.
-I want sea breams. Not farm-grown. -Sure. Come with me.
-I quit swearing, smart guy. -That's for the best, sir.
You're getting into strange habits, old man.
You're into fishing now?
It's not about the fish. I'm killing time, Asim.
-I feed the gulls if I catch anything. -Take from the sea, give to the poor.
Something like that.
So, what about the news?
There's this guy, a regular at our place, Sitki Besnici.
Luckily, he stopped by.
He knows every hole in the city. He knows all the rats.
What does he do?
People say he works for the police, but I think he works for himself.
He knows everyone.
But nobody knows him.
But when he sits down with you, he blathers on forever.
What's the driving force behind the economy? Needs.
What is it that determines our needs?
Our urges.
And who guides these urges?
The advertisers, the media, the chain of markets.
What does the market do to us?
It turns things we don't need into things we need.
In fact, that's part of human nature. Animals are the same way.
Baboons, for example.
What do baboons eat? Bananas.
But they'll grab that water from the tourist's bag.
It's their own habitat.
How do you communicate with the baboon?
You showed him the water. Now he fancies it.
He's a monkey, and he's right.
Am I wrong?
About those phone tricksters--
Like smartphones.
Give it to some idiot and before long, it will turn as dumb as an ashtray.
But in the hands of cunning people, it becomes a weapon.
There seems to be a consensus between the trickster and the tricked.
The caller exerts authoritarian pressure upon the person called.
It's like stealing the child within him.
You know the story of the boy who cried wolf?
Is that shepherd a psycho?
What does shrimp mean to you?
Life is very much like football, as they say.
Perhaps the shepherd had the spirit of a fireman and gave the folks a drill.
Sea urchins do the same but they're innocent.
Nobody knows that.
There's a gang disguised as dried fruit dealers.
They pull all sorts of tricks.
They commit all sorts of genital and digital fraud under that guise.
-Genital? -Visual provocation and blackmail.
This is where the genital and the digital are intertwined.
They cause the victim to have an erection through various means.
And then they establish his location and blackmail him.
Do you believe in horoscopes? I don't.
The environment a person grows up in is what constitutes his identity.
For example, they say Taurus and Cancer get along well.
You don't see such a thing in nature.
It won't work in human relationships.
I'm divorcing my fourth wife again.
I'm a Cancer and the fourth wife is a Taurus.
All four were Tauruses. What's your sign?
-Virgo. -I've always wanted to be a Virgo.
-So he bored you to death? -He took hours to tell me an address.
I appreciate that, old man.
-Are you getting along with your daughter? -Sure, she's fond of me now.
Who isn't fond of you?
She's like a block of ice that I can't melt.
-She's like her late mother. -May she rest in peace.
-"First, quit this shady work," she says. -And what do you say?
I can't find anything to say, my friend.
See you later. Thank you.
OPEN
CLOSED
-Greetings. -Hello.
-Is this Wet Huseyin's store? -It's "Rat," not "Wet."
Some rats are wet.
What do you want?
-Let us go inside. -What?
Inside.
What is this you're drinking, for God's sake?
What is this?
Leave it, Pokemon.
Prepaid cards, phones. Looks like you're well equipped.
Someone ripped off the groom at the wedding hall. Was it you?
-We don't know about that. -We have nothing to do with that.
We did some shady work a while ago, but now we sell dried fruits.
-So who is Huseyin? -This is Huseyin, sir.
-Was it you who did that job? -Speak.
-Say something. -Pokemon.
Who are we talking to here? Speak!
I'm talking to you! Talk to me now!
Okay, I'll tell you.
It was the work of the Gebes Family, Taci Gebes.
They've been boasting about it, since it's been in the news.
Where are these people?
There's a hookah place where they hang out called Hisargile.
If you're giving us false information, I'll visit you again with Pokemon.
No, sir. It's right.
I don't know their address but I'll let you know when they come.
-Promise? -I promise, sir.
-Give me a hundred. -Why?
Just give it to me.
Look, boy. You keep this hundred.
Keep your word, be our friend and you'll get another hundred.
-But if you don't... -My hand.
Serbulent.
Serbulent!
Take these nuts. Eat them hot.
-Why did I give you that money? -Don't worry. I took it back.
-So give it back to me. -It's not yours. It's his.
Right. He got it from the tea boy.
Tea boy? Give my money back. You sons of bitches, give money back.
Ariza!
I said, "Who do you think you're talking to?"
Understand who you're talking to.
I said...
"I had a patient who was presumed dead
and I sent him skiing in two weeks."
She knows. He was almost dead when I saw him.
Fifteen days later, he was skiing.
He sends me snowballs every once in a while.
He means he sends him postcards.
-You keep pursing those lips. -I started off like that, so...
Now, listen to me.
I called almost all of my friends in high places.
They're looking into the matter.
Hopefully we'll be solving this very shortly. Cheers.
There's only one way to find those men. I've done some research.
There are these thugs. You go and ask them.
They find the tricksters for a price.
They even beat them if you want.
-No. -Which is what I'd personally prefer.
No way.
You've said that before. I don't endorse that at all.
What about order? What about the rule of law?
You don't know what it feels like to be conned.
How can we know? We've never conned anyone.
-He means we are never conned. -Right?
They embarrassed me in front of everyone, especially the woman I love.
I'm filled with resentment, Nazli. I'm itching for vengeance.
But vengeance is no good, Balamir. You'll end up hurting yourself.
-It's Bahadir, Ms. Inci. -Oh, sorry, dear.
Listen, just relax and wait.
Those men will bring back the money.
That is how it will play out. Don't worry.
They will help things play out this way.
Thank you. We'd like to thank you in advance, sir.
This distant attitude of yours, those formal words, drive me crazy.
It gets on my nerves.
So, Nazli.
When you grew up,
you saw that I wasn't the lovable man you thought I was, right?
But don't forget.
There's nothing I love more than you and that will never change.
-You should know that. -Nazli.
Forgive me for asking, but what is it you don't like about these people?
He spoke such beautiful words.
My late father never said such beautiful words to me.
Don't worry. You'll dislike him when you know him.
-Oh, no. -Come on.
My father-in-law is a doctor who sent a dead man skiing.
-Cheers, sir. -Cheers, dear.
Mom! Oh, Mom! Help! Someone help us!
-Please, someone call a doctor! -They need a doctor, sir.
Let's wait. Maybe there's another doctor.
I wouldn't want to rush to grab the case.
For God's sake, isn't there a doctor here? Mom!
Here he is. The best doctor in the world here.
-Don't say that. -Mom, lie down.
Oh, fuck.
-Please, help. -Who is the patient?
-I'm a doctor. What's wrong? -Something's wrong.
-I don't know. -She's lying down.
Lift her legs. Help blood run to her brain.
Let's lift her legs. Help blood run to her brain.
Lift her legs. Not like that.
Don't grunt like that. Try to breathe.
-Should we do cardiac massage? -Well said.
That's the kind of smart patient relative that we like.
-Massage-- -Press down.
Breasts? No way.
There. Let's find a way to the heart.
And one! And two! Perhaps it's better not to count?
-She's dying. -Madam.
Take a deep breath, madam.
Get up.
One, two, three.
-She swallowed a plum. -Bravo!
Thank you.
The lady was having a non-swallowing related spasm.
-Thankfully, I solved the problem. -Here you are.
Thank you.
-Now, I'll deliver a nice speech. -Let's hear it.
You see, sometimes, a sad event can give way to such nicety.
Nicety? What do you mean?
Something bad happens,
but that bad thing leads to something good.
I want that to be called "nicety."
-Let's call it that. -And dear Bahadir,
my father has never spoken nice words
to my face, or to my back, either.
So I'll now raise a toast to the lovers,
and those who don't disappoint their loved ones.
-"Honey"! -I see.
Cheers.
-I told you it was going to be nice. -You did, but--
-Bravo! I think it was excellent. -And there's more, dear Balamir.
Now it's time to dance. Let's go. Nazli, come on.
Doctor! VJ, play "Doctor!"
Doctor, find a cure for my troubles!
Doctor, find a cure for my troubles
I can't get enough of her Give me my medicine
Morning, night, before each meal...
Balamir!
I want her by my side every moment
Ariza, there's new fish at the tea house. Wait to hear from me.
-Are those my folks? -Yes.
-Here's your hundred. -No need. This one's on me.
-Really? -Okay, give it to me.
Hello, Tutku. What's the situation? Let's just sell it.
Let's just sell it for 1500 a ton and be done with it, right?
Someone important is on the other line. I must hang up.
Nobody is calling on the other line. I said that just to hang up.
May I sit down? I'm Semih Erken.
Hello, sir. Do you remember me?
I don't seem to recall you. Sorry?
Have a nice morning, Tumbling Ziya.
That's Ziya.
-What are you doing here? -Saruhan, you--
This place--
I can't believe this.
I was just about to ask you for more time to pay my debt.
This is such a coincidence.
-Was it you who conned this man? -Sir, this is the man. Positive.
-I swear on all your dead relatives-- -Man.
If you ever...
If you ever swear on my dead relatives again...
your whole life, the municipality you're registered to,
and your whole family-- oh, man.
Man!
My ear.
Look, I quit swearing, you know that?
You understand? I quit swearing.
I promised my girlfriend not to swear. But not swearing is very hard.
-It's very hard not to swear. Got that? -Yes.
Don't make me break my oath. But you're such a mother-- oh, man.
Sir, it's the police!
Mother--
-He ran away, didn't he? -Yes, sir.
Step back.
I'm biting my tongue not to swear at you.
And you bite yours as if I had sworn heavily at you.
-Yes, sir. -Get in! Get in the car.
You deserve a beating! You're six meters tall and trying not to run!
Smart boy, get in.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Dr. Asim.
-Who? -Dr. Asim Noyan. Associate Professor.
-We don't have a doctor by that name. -You don't?
-We don't. -I met him here the day before.
-How could I meet him if he doesn't exist? -I'm sure he exists but not here.
He's not listed.
-I see. -Have a healthy day!
Have a nice day.
What's up? Where's Nazli?
She's at the register.
-Hello. -What's up, Goofy Groom?
I'm fine, big mouth!
-How are you? -Why did you come here?
I went to the hospital.
-What hospital? -The one where we met your father.
And?
I asked for your father. They said he wasn't there.
-Why not? -I don't know.
I said he was an associate professor. But no.
Why did you go there?
-To ask him for money. -For what?
To pay the advance-- to make a deal with some thugs. As a loan.
-What thugs? You'll drive me crazy. -What am I supposed to do?
-Just wait with my hands tied? -Yes. What else can you do?
We're not going to do anything. The thugs will.
-We'll just pay them. -To hell with your thugs!
Bahadir, I have customers waiting.
Go on. We'll talk later.
I don't know, Dad. I was shocked. I didn't know what to say.
He went to the hospital out of the blue.
He was going to ask you to lend him money to give to thugs.
Such nonsense.
And they told him that there was no such doctor.
What shall I tell him? What if he figures it out?
He wants to come and talk to you.
Okay.
Talk to you later. I have to go now.
Think of it this way.
If my father hadn't made me marry an alcoholic beast,
and the man hadn't beaten me on the first night,
and I hadn't ran away, and started working at a gambling den,
I'd have never met your father.
-So? -So...
the lesser evil is good for us.
And your dad is the kindest of all evils.
Or we're stuck with the worst.
Playing doctor is always a risky lie.
You should've made up a freelance job like a businessman or a trader.
Sorry, Dad. I'm not as good a liar as you are.
Good, my dear. You shouldn't try to be, anyway.
And this father of yours wouldn't even look at me when I was fat.
-How did we get to this now? -As soon as I lost 19 kilos,
his attitude suddenly changed-- "Don't call me brother," and so on.
Okay, I give up. Call me brother.
No way. You know what your father is like.
So I stopped saying that.
Don't worry, my dear. We'll find a way.
No, Dad. We won't find a way.
Everyone is fooling the poor man. Including me.
-But this will be solved in three days. -Dad, please.
Don't you see? Lies can't fix anything.
But you have liars' disease.
It's not a disease, dear. It's my profession.
Take a look around and see if I'm the only one
whose profession is lying.
-But you're the best at it. -Don't say that.
No, you are.
Are you boasting about this?
We're not boasting. I don't defend what he does.
-But he's the best. -No, there were great ones before.
Like my master.
That guy could take the underwear beneath your trousers.
I never knew him. But how about your doctor impression?
It's like character play, like an impersonation.
I'm getting goosebumps. Bravo.
It was a bad idea. I should've never come to you.
It's all right. I don't work at the hospital.
-I go there for occasional operations. -There he goes again. But that's great.
All right, Dad.
It's over.
I came to you and I became you.
It was my mistake to come here. And now I'll fix it.
I'll tell Bahadir the truth.
-Goodbye. -Nazli, don't be silly.
Nazli. Hello.
What are you doing here? What is this place?
-Bahadir. -Baha-- Bahadir!
I can't believe we met here.
What brings you here? What a surprise, isn't it, Inci?
Enthusiasm for cars.
Ms. Inci and I hang out here in our spare time to chill out.
It's a special place. It helps us relax.
Dad, stop. I'll tell him the truth.
The truth? What truth?
I was just coming to you to tell you everything.
I knew my father wasn't a doctor.
-You did? -Yes, I made that up.
So, what does he do if he's not a doctor?
-My father is a-- -An associate professor.
-He's a con man. -What?
Yes.
Hello, brother.
What? What do you mean?
Wait a minute. Now I get it. It was you from the start.
-On the phone and so on. -See, the idiot figured it all out.
-So you were in this all along? -No, Bahadir. Don't be silly.
Yes, you were! Your father is a con man, you're a liar!
-He treated that woman that night. -Bahadir, please listen.
I want to drop dead right now. How could you do this to me?
How could you do it? For the money?
-Bahadir! -Shame on you!
Shame on you!
Wait a minute, listen to me! It's not like you think, Bahadir!
Bahadir!
That's what you get for telling the truth, dear.
Get your hands off me! I never want to see your face again!
-Never! -Nazli, please don't do that.
Oh, no.
Brother Uzeyir.
If you had been here now, we'd have had a great time sitting quietly together.
Lots of jerks around talking nonsense
while the men we can sit quietly with are dying one by one.
I wish such a poem had been written. It would be nice, right?
BACK IN THE DAY, I SPOKE A LOT. IT WAS NO GOOD FOR ME, AND I QUIT.
How could I forget?
What do you think? We checked its blood pressure.
It's a nice one. It's smoking hot.
Shall we go for a drive?
I've been thinking, perhaps we should do as Kerami said
and quit this thing and open a store or something.
-A store? -Yes.
God has given you a gift. You found your daughter after years.
Don't you think this is an opportunity to quit?
She said "never." Twice!
She says she doesn't want to see my face again. Never!
This girl scolds me like no one else has.
Baby, that tattoo on your chest is really beautiful.
But it doesn't make you a father.
Loving is not enough.
What else should I do?
You need to say it.
You need to show your love.
If you tell Nazli you'll quit, and if we really quit, that could work.
We can go down south.
We could open a seaside restaurant.
What an original project.
We can buy fish for five and sell for 50.
We'll take Nazli and Bahadir.
We'd both get pregnant.
You'll have both a child and a grandchild.
Is that original enough?
It's too original. It's disgusting.
You must be considering getting married someday.
That's a subject I prefer to keep my mouth shut about.
-You're a real heartbreaker. -But I have an analytical side, too.
Hello.
You made the garden look like an amusement park.
-I kept calling. Why don't you answer? -I don't answer. Why do you keep calling?
You said you don't want to see me. So I figured we could speak on the phone.
Just not a video call.
What does your phone say when I call you? What name did you save me under?
It says "Dad!!" With two exclamation marks.
Two exclamation marks.
What surprises you so much?
Nazli.
I really don't like you not liking me.
I don't want anyone else to like me. I don't care about that.
But you, you're different.
Nazli.
Shall I take you somewhere you've always loved?
One you'll love now, too?
Row, row, row your boat With the boatman's oar
With the baker's peer
It's "peel," dear. Not "peer."
"No, with the baker's peer!"
"Peese, Dad, peese."
-There you go. -Thanks, man.
"Thanks, man."
I actually liked it but didn't let on.
-What? -Your tattoo.
You know I don't like tattoos. This is the only one I have.
That's why I liked it.
It hurt so much. The guy kept drilling my chest
-cruelly for three hours. -All right, Dad. Don't overdo it.
Don't you worry at all. Daddy will take care of this.
"Daddy" with two exclamation marks. Save me like that.
Oh, Dad.
Things could have been much better.
Why are you like this?
All right, I may have done wrong, but I'm cute. Right?
It's not cute that you've done wrong.
Right, it's not.
Show some effort, Dad. People can change.
Yes, they can. A cucumber can become a pickle.
But pudding, that's very hard.
Every cucumber wants to become pudding, after all.
But it's very hard.
Very hard.
Goal!
BAHCESEHIR COLLEGE
I went to school for one day.
And that was to help some friends steal something from the cafeteria.
Go on. I'll join you.
What do you want?
You took my money, my love, everything I had.
What else?
Stop that soap opera talk and listen carefully.
Yes, I'm not a doctor-- I mean,
not a medical doctor. Our expertise is different.
A project is conducted within an organized concept.
A product that doesn't belong to us is made to belong to us.
So you're thieves.
If we liked that word, we would use it and not beat around the bush.
-Sorry. -So yes, this is what we are.
But my daughter has nothing to do with any of this.
-No. I think she's very good at lying. -No.
If she had been, you wouldn't have figured it out.
And you fall for everyone else's lies. Just fall for hers, too.
What do you say, my friend?
How does that saying go?
"When the truth is ugly..."
-"A handsome lie will work better." -That's it.
My Nazli is pure and innocent. She hasn't done a single thing wrong.
That's why she keeps telling me off!
We're the ones busy with murky business. Got that?
-Are you the phone tricksters, too? -Come on. Are you crazy?
She asked for help. That's how I got involved.
She was refusing me before that.
It's all because of you. Indeed, because of you.
If you hadn't swallowed that bait, she wouldn't have come to me.
Should I actually thank him?
-No, don't go that far. -Right.
So does Nazli love me?
Unfortunately.
Unfortunately.
-This is a private school, right? -Yes, it is.
Where's the safe?
Please--
He's kidding, man!
They keep the money in a bank, not here.
Look, Bahadir.
For some reason, my daughter loves you.
I have to accept that.
But from now on, if you hurt Nazli, even one bit--
I think you got the message.
I have, Dad.
And don't call me "Dad" before I call you "son."
-Understood? -Understood, sir.
Good. Wait here.
He's such a good man, Nazli.
I never thought I'd be matchmaking for my daughter. Here.
Okay, stop sulking.
Welcome.
Hello.
So where have you been?
At the deep end of hell.
Any place away from you is hell for me.
So where did you stay?
-Hilmi's. He made me sleep on the couch. -Where else would you sleep?
Wait, wait! I got it.
Got it.
T-R-U-C-K-S-U-I-T.
What's that?
The kind of clothes you wear when doing athletics. Trucksuit.
The clothing you wear doing athletics is a tracksuit.
There are regional variations for every word, fat lips.
-We've located the faggot Ziya. -No swearing.
-No swearing. -Well done, my love.
-Nektar! -Sorry.
-Tell me. -We found Mr. Ziya's location.
We visited the coffee boy again.
It turns out he knew where he was all along.
-Is that for real? -I swear, sir.
Out.
I accept this one. It's my turn.
-What? Wait, what--? -Triple score.
This confuses me. Let's do something else.
-Why, darling? -It's over my head. I'm getting bored.
But you're learning new words. What was the last word you learned?
-"Empathy." -Right.
"To put yourself in someone else's situation."
That's my darling! I'll bite that belly of yours.
-Stop it now! -Let me bite that belly.
Stop it! I'm getting nervous.
-He said "empathy"! -Wait, stop.
Stop it. I have a tic, you know that. Don't.
-Go down. -Okay.
I don't mean that. Go downstairs, to the bedroom.
Okay.
-And turn off the lights. Listen. -Yes?
-Turn off the lights. I'm coming. -Okay.
I'll bite you.
Come on!
There you go! We lost the money!
Let's get started.
-That stuffing is homemade. -No, it's store-bought.
-The girls put currant in it! -Store-bought!
-You want to bet? -Asim.
We got a message from the hookah place. The guy is there.
Okay, everyone get ready. Get the tools.
And call the captain. We'll be sailing.
-The traffic would give us cancer. -Let me come with you.
I messed it up. Let me be there as we fix it.
This is not like the movies. This is very serious and dirty work.
That you know nothing about.
I've been talking about some thugs.
It turns out those thugs were you.
Let me join you. I'm the only one who can identify him.
I just need to hear his voice. I have great ears. Really.
Unfortunately, he is right.
Okay, let him come.
-Be careful, darling. -Don't worry, darling.
Stop saying "darling" in front of your father.
-Asim, please be careful. -Don't worry.
You stay on the sidelines. No questions.
Do as I say. Do not talk nonsense. Understood?
-Understood, Dad. -And don't "Dad" me.
-Are those guns real? -Of course not. We never use real guns.
-You think we're gangsters? -Of course not.
It's them.
I think we're just a little bit late. I'm just saying.
Have a nice day, Your Excellency.
May you prosper, Asim.
They're going to the boat.
If we chase them, we can perhaps save one more poor fellow, God willing.
-Why do you ramble on so much? -I guess I'm scared.
When my fear levels rise, I get this rambling reflex.
-And that can cause other things-- -Let's get out.
-Let's get some fresh Bosphorus air. -Right.
Why aren't we going?
The men know you. They'll run if they see you, right?
-Right. -Don't poke your nose into anything.
Just tell me if the guy is our man. That's it.
I know.
I used to have a gang when I was a kid.
Once the men come, I'll act calmly. I'll signal to you if it's him or not.
-It's all good. -Your son-in-law is talking nonsense.
I've been alive for 50 years, I have yet to see a person who doesn't.
Either there's no such person or I haven't met them.
But the men--
-Where's the guy? -Over there.
That Dalmatian?
-Yes. -Pokemon.
-What shall we drink, my friend? -I'll have a lemona--
Berkay! Brother!
Berkay, my brother!
Help me take him outside.
Okay, brother.
Dude, you just couldn't solve your problems.
Sex isn't everything! It happens all the time.
We'll take care of it. Dude. Sex isn't everything.
It's only been three months.
-Hold on, pretty face! -Berkay?
Let's lay him down here.
-Lay him down. -Hope he gets well soon.
-What--? -Step out quietly, Mr. DA.
Who are you?
He said quietly. Step out.
-Come here. -Come on!
Berkay, you must have mistaken me for someone else.
-We'll make you someone else in a minute. -That was a good pun.
That's not a pun. It's a figure of speech.
-Figure? What figure? -Right, figure.
Hello, sir.
I've just explained it to the guys.
There must be a misunders--
Is it him?
Mr. Temizel, this is DA Ilhan Gundogan.
Man!
It's him.
They got the man. They'll con him in the boat!
Look at him. He's running away like a cat!
-Smarty. -Yes.
This is an old habit of mine. I drive every vehicle myself.
In other words,
I don't get in any vehicle I can't drive myself.
I even drive the taxis I get in. I ask the driver, "Can you move aside?"
-I ask him nicely. -Right.
How is this gun fake? It's real!
Stop that! Don't mess with it!
Idiot.
Boss, we've got company.
So these jerks are well-prepared.
Get up! Get up!
-What's going on? -Call your friends right now.
Tell them to go away.
Or I'll tie weights to your feet and send you to the bottom.
-What friends? -Those ones!
What friends? What's going on? I know nothing about this!
Don't lie!
I swear, I've got nothing to do with them, or we would be negotiating.
He's right.
So who's following us?
-Maybe our friend Ziya knows! -What?
-I swear on your dead relatives! -Ziya, who are these men?
-Tell him, man! -I'll tell!
It's Saruhan.
-Saruhan who? -You know.
Blond Saruhan?
-You put the betting mafia on my tail? -Boss, please! Please!
Beat him!
What are you doing? Don't get carried away!
Asim.
Can we go a little faster?
You!
Pull over!
-You give Istanbul a bad name! -That's the iron dealer, Naim!
-How did they get together? -I have no idea.
You're still lying!
It's closing! It's almost closed!
You broke the bridge!
-Get in the cars! -Come here!
Come on! Quick!
They're coming!
Move!
Step on it! He's coming!
-I'm stepping on it! Can't you see! -Come on, step on it!
Come on! Come on!
-Oh, no! -No!
Turn around!
Get out of the way!
Move!
We're flying!
Thank God.
Now tell me, how will you get our money back?
-What money? -The money you stole from me, Mr. DA.
I have nothing to do with that. I swear.
-Bahadir. -Okay!
Let's go to my office. I'll present the money there.
-He said okay. Why did you hit him? -I asked for the taxi fare that day.
-They didn't give me any. -He didn't faint. He's faking.
Get up!
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
We'll climb these stairs.
Don't attract attention!
Ouch! My shoulder really hurts!
Really? You poor thing.
-Sir, I'm feeling really dizzy. -Walk on, man!
-This way? -This way, sir.
-Can I catch my breath for a moment? -Move!
Here.
Wait. You wait here, okay?
-But the action will take place inside. -What?
I'll miss the best part.
I wish I had enough time to beat you now. Just stand there!
-Oh, hello. -Have a nice day, sir.
This is the first time I've met a real midg-- small person.
I'd show you the real thing, but I don't have time.
What a sweet thing.
So let's see the money, brother.
Stop laughing, Dalmatian.
Sahin!
I laugh for two reasons.
One, there's not a single note in the stash.
The money must already be on its way to Snow White.
-Who? -"Snow White"!
-The dwarf! -What dwarf?
A midget walked right past me. He had a bag with him.
He ran away! I'll show you!
Bahadir, stay out of it!
The second reason I laugh,
I heard that handsome kid saying in the boat,
those guns are fake.
We really have an expert jerk here.
Right, these are fake.
It's a matter of principle.
An "If you're smart enough, you don't need these," kind of thing.
But don't think these are useless. They do come in handy sometimes.
-Such as when? -Such as now.
Get up!
Get over there!
You, too. Move!
You, come here! Get up!
Listen, Dalmatian. Never forget this.
Nobody, I mean nobody, hurts my daughter.
-He isn't there? -No.
-Welcome. -Hello.
Dad, where is Bahadir?
He went after the money.
-Where is the money? -The dwarf took it away.
-Where is the dwarf? -Dad, where is Bahadir?
He went after the dwarf, dear. He went chasing the money.
What dwarf, Dad? What happened to Bahadir?
Here's what happened. He was waiting outside
when the dwarf went that way and he went after him.
Because we were fighting the men inside.
We wrestled the men around the room and when we got out, we looked around.
-We couldn't find him. -So you just left without him?
Dad, what have you done?
Asim, is this dwarf a very short person or an actual--?
-Does that detail really matter? -No.
And where are our guys?
Who are these people?
Boys?
What happened to you?
We flew into the sea. We almost drowned.
They took us out and they beat us wet.
-We dried as they beat us. -And then they wet us again.
And beat us again.
My bones are aching.
Greetings.
Hello.
Hello.
-Do you remember me, sir? -I can't seem to recall you right now.
We ate salmon caviar together.
Well, it's Naim! This is unbelievable.
Believe me, those boys have been looking for you all over the place.
Look where a small misunderstanding has brought us.
Let me treat you to some fine jumbo shrimp.
Thank you, no.
I've developed a dislike for all seafood, thanks to you.
Oh, no.
Let's not dwell on this matter for too long in front of the ladies.
Bring us the money you've taken from this man, right now.
Here's how we can solve that matter.
Ziya. Not Ziya.
Ariza, open the safe. Bring whatever we have.
We don't have much at hand as you came without notice.
We can pay the first part now and pay the rest in parts
because our promise is our honor. We are faithful to our debt.
Either you bring all the money you've taken, or Nektar...
-Sir. -Nektar will shoot.
I don't like it, but Nektar will shoot.
Please, there's no need for shooting.
Actually, I have an idea. A much better one.
Nektar, I'll count up to three. Shoot him in the right kneecap.
-Dad! -Asim!
Don't assume the worst right away.
-They have yet to count to three. -I'm ready.
-One. -Sir.
-Dad. -Asim.
Two. -Asim.
Move. It may pass through and hit you.
-Look away, dear. -Hello everyone.
Bahadir?
I did it, darling. Look.
I told you I could do it.
We'll hand him over to the police. I told the taxi driver he was drunk.
Those men.
Bahadir, son. What great timing.
Well done! The money is there, isn't it?
Now take out whatever we owe to the gentleman and hand it to them.
We shall never owe such esteemed people again.
Shame on you!
Nektar, bring the bag.
No.
Perhaps you should take the exact amount, not the whole thing.
Open it.
-There's a lot in here, sir. -My God, thank you.
-Enough? -Enough, sir.
So come on, then.
Mr. Saruhan. Mr. Saruhan.
Now, we're not strangers here.
Truthfully, there's much more in the bag than what we took from Naim.
What do you say
we find a way to insure justice in the income distribution?
For example, how about not taking all the money?
To accept a result-oriented approach.
He's lost in thought.
He was going to speak but he changed his mind.
The rebellious black singer Bob Marley sings these lines I like very much.
-What? -What?
He says, to the one he leaves behind...
"I'll leave your life like a shooting star
And all you can do Is make a wish after me."
That's a beautiful lyric.
-A beautiful lyric. -It's a bit long, but it's nice.
-Who's Bob Marley? -The smoker.
-With the curly--? -Right.
-Get in the front seat. -Right.
Are you warm or cold towards the idea of working for us?
What are the terms, sir?
There are no terms, Smarty.
For example, what will my wage be?
Do I get a raise every six months? Do I get insurance? These things matter.
I'm sorry, Nazli.
We failed. We were fooled. We couldn't get the money.
It's all right, Dad.
We won something more important than money.
Look, we're almost a family again.
Given that you're quitting, of course.
My baby is right, Asim.
Don't you think this is a good opportunity to quit now?
-This is no way to hit a small man. -You hit me first.
This is all we ended up with.
The robber midget of Snow White.
So have a nice day. Have a nice day.
He's running! Come here!
Where are you going?
Can we have a brief word?
What's that? Darling, our money!
Give me that. Is there more?
-No more. -There must be more. Keep looking.
Go deeper.
The last one was my shroud money.
Your shroud won't cost much.
-Darling, our money is here. -I don't want to touch that.
Perhaps you shouldn't have kissed it. The money is still warm.
I got carried away there.
Well done, Bahadir.
Well done, son.
Thank you. Thank you, Dad.
Be blessed, son.
-Ms. Nazli! -My dear!
-What's your name? -Muko.
Give this jerk, Mr. Muko, something to eat.
I told you I had a gang. We were really vicious.
My only son turned out to be an idiot, Vakkas.
I gave him all I could.
I raised him on the most expensive baby food--
I used to drive to the countryside every weekend to get him goat milk.
Turns out that goat milk isn't that good, after all.
-I tried my best. -Hello.
Wait. Here comes my tube of a son. I'll hang up now. I'll call you later.
You're even cursing me to people on the phone now, Dad?
Where have you been for days?
-I had work to do. -Really? What work?
If I were to tell you now, "Dad, I caught those men
and I got our money back, I even got some interest on it."
-Right. -For instance.
And then if I were to put the brand-new bills on the table.
-What would you say? -"Thank God!" That's what I'd say!
What else could I say? I'd take the money.
I'd take it in my arms and hug it!
You should hug your son, not the money.
Tell me, son, how did you do this? Tell me.
How did I do it? A very good question.
The rebellious black singer Bob Marley sings this line I like very much.
What is it?
-He says-- -Four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13...
-You're not listening. Goodness. -Fifteen, 16, 17...
Nazli, welcome!
-Lerzan, how are you? -Oh, my baby is here!
Hello.
-I'm sweaty. -It's all right.
-What brings you here? -I brought you this.
Oh! Congratulations.
If you come,
I will assume you're quitting.
If you're not quitting, please don't come.
See you at the wedding.
Hopefully.
She spoke so briefly yet so clearly. Right?
Yes, Lerzan, but...
if I leave this Asim behind so late in my life, which Asim can I be?
A better one. A more beautiful one.
NAZLI AND BAHADIR
SANTIROGLU FAMILY
-Shall we start? -He's not going to come.
Let's start.
Dear guests, now I shall start the wedding ceremony.
-Your first and last name? -Nazli Noyan.
-Your first and last name? -Bahadir Temizel.
You informed our institution of your intention to get married.
There is no legal obstacle interfering with your intention.
If you would, please declare your wish to be married
in front of guests and witnesses,
I will pronounce you husband and wife.
Of your own free will, do you accept Bahadir Temizel as your husband?
Yes!
Do you accept Nazli Noyan as your wife?
Yes!
Bravo!
I pronounce you husband and wife. Congratulations!
Who are these people?
These people are our family, my love.
Come here. Come.
I'll quit, dear.
I have a certain amount in mind. Once I make that, I'll quit.
Oh, please, come on!
Yes, next week.
Next week.
What a disgrace this boy is!
It's your boy DJ Teddy P, and listen,
I'm hearin' some things.
I'm hearin' that there might be a super-exclusive listening party
for the new Cre album tonight.
Now, I don't know when or where it is, but if it's Cre, you know it'll be hot.
So if his people don't call me soon with the invite,
I might have to leak this track that just got sent to me.
You already know what time it is.
Yo, Cre! Hit me up! Ha-ha!
[female voice] Yes!
Fabulous!
Okay, these two pair of lashes are weighing down my lids.
Shh. Okay. Now, tilt to the side.
-Okay. -Yes.
-Now sultry, but with a holding. -Okay.
Yes. Yes!
-Okay, we're done. I got it. -Okay. We good?
This is a perfect last-Countdown-to-Epic-Music post.
Oh my gosh, I'm so nervous. My hands are shaking.
Erica, when has anyone ever not liked a Cre album?
[sighs] I know.
The man is a musical genius,
which is why he picked you to sing on these tracks.
-After tonight's listening party… -Yes. …and the release of his album, your life will never be the same.
…and the release of his album, your life will never be the same.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yes, and I cannot wait for you to hear it. Because, girl… [inhales] …I killed it.
Of course, you did! Now grab your purse.
Oh, wait. Oh, is that a snag?
Amber! [gasps]
No!
You really don't have anything else to wear.
I put everything in storage when I came to crash with you.
Why isn't this in storage?
-Just leave it. -No.
No, seriously, come on, girl. Put it back.
-We can make this work. -You're not cutting up my wedding dress.
Okay, you are never going to wear this.
-And Jason is never coming back. -[sighs]
So, really, we're just making lemonade out of relationship trauma lemons.
What's it gonna be?
Congrats, superstar.
-Thank you, girl. -Yeah.
If it wasn't for you getting all the right people
to repost my little Insta videos, I wouldn't even be on Cre's radar.
to repost my little Insta videos, I wouldn't even be on Cre's radar. -Thank you. -[squeals]
[female announcer] Welcome to the most exclusive listening party in New York City.
[female announcer] You're about to hear the album of the year before it drops.
Get ready for Cre!
Some of you are here to experience what's next.
-Yes! -Because this is a listening party.
And you are here to listen.
Y'all ready to listen?
-[crowd] Yeah! -Whoo!
Good.
'Cause I want y'all to hear me when I say I'm tired of being ripped off!
Last time someone stole my work and leaked one of my tracks online,
what did I say? Huh?
This is my last album,
but no one's ever gonna hear it
because this world doesn't deserve it!
-You should-- You should look away. -[groans]
[Erica crying] I mean, I really thought my dreams were coming true.
But this… [sobs] …this is not a dream.
No, this is… [sobs] …this is a nightmare!
No.
He's gonna have to release the album. The record label's gonna make him.
He is the label.
He owns it.
-Oh. -[sobs]
-[whining] Yeah! Just my luck. -Oh, I'm sorry. -[girl singing "No One"] -[groans]
Where you goin'?
Stop. Stop. Can you please stop?
Play-- Play something else. Play anything else.
-Why? -[Amber] Because--
Because I was gonna get married last year
to that beautiful song…
[sniffles] …to a nice man, Jason.
But he left to Charleston,
and I didn't go with him.
You know, he was a banker.
And he used to make these rice bowls,
and I just never made it home on time to eat them,
and then he called off the wedding.
And he took the rice maker.
[whimpering] I don't have any more rice.
Come on.
Look at me wearing my wedding dress.
And they were singing my wedding song.
I know.
Aw, come on. -Come on. -[sobbing]
Happy Birthday, Jason, you amazing, wonderful man.
-Holy snap! Really? -Oh, come on!
[Erica] Yes!
Thank you.
Now it's time to see if that wish actually comes true or not.
Oh!
-[Jason] Erica Wilson… -[gasps]
Wait, wait, wait.
Will you marry me?
Yes. Yes.
-Yes? -Yes!
-You will? -Yes! [giggles]
-Damn! Come on! -[cheering, applauding]
[Amber] Erica?
Erica?
-[applauding] -[Amber] Erica?
That is not healthy.
What's the last time you went outside?
Outside costs money for one.
And B… [grunts] …red wine is full of antioxidants, so it's practically like a smoothie.
-Not really. -[groans]
Or at least a green juice, except it's purple.
Okay, look, I know it's been a tough couple of months,
but that is all about to change
because you're going to a tropical paradise!
Feast your eyes on the Mer de Saphir Resort
on the truly, stupidly gorgeous island of Mauritius.
I'm doing the social media for them,
and the point person mentioned they were looking for entertainers.
So, I sent him your Instagram, and he said, "When can she get here?"
Okay, where's Mauritius?
It's 700 miles east of Madagascar.
And look at the Jolly Rancher blue ocean.
Hmm, it's beautiful.
And really, Amber, thank you so much for always putting me on.
But this is one step up from singing on a cruise ship.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means I haven't been grinding my whole life,
chasing my dreams of making my own music,
so I can sing cover songs in the hotel lobby.
It means I didn't lose a fiancé to become a lounge singer.
It also means I didn't risk everything, and I mean everything--
-Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. -What? Like to be a karaoke singer?
-Who am I? -Okay. Okay.
I see you ramping up, but let me stop you.
You didn't lose a fiancé.
He lost you by moving to Charleston for some boring VP job
in finance or whatever.
It's just seasonal.
Four months and you are back here in New York.
-Mm-mm. -I think you should consider this.
Because I'm worried if you don't do something,
you may never shake this funk off of you.
Who do you see yourself as?
Someone who fuses into the couch,
or someone who's ready to take another leap?
-[in Australian accent] Erica Wilson? -Yes. Barrington?
At your service.
Welcome to Mauritius!
I was just getting some band stuff before, uh, before I got you.
-Oh good. -Yeah.
But, um, well, I'm in the band, your band.
-Oh? -Yeah, yeah.
-Okay. Nice. -Guitars.
-Cool. -Uh, I'm also the, um, shuttle driver,
turtle wrangler, craft cocktail chemist.
-Yeah. -Um, among other things.
Okay, uh, they're… they're only expecting me to sing here. Right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I pick up the extra jobs 'cause I'm saving to buy a house.
-[Erica] Oh? -Yeah.
I came here a few years ago and, um…
fell in love.
Wow, my gosh. Look at that.
I can see why. I mean, If you can wake up to this every day forever, why not?
Yeah, the island's beautiful, but I was talking about my girlfriend.
Well, she's from here and never wants to leave her home.
Oh, that's cool,
staying here for her.
Incoming.
[in French accent] Hello, Erica. I'm Claire.
I'm sure Barrington's brought you up to speed with arrival procedures.
Why don't you follow me, and I'll give you a little tour.
She'll be in cabana 78. Make sure her luggage gets there, and Barrington,
remove your vehicle.
And don't be late for rehearsal.
As you know, we are a five-star resort,
and service adds brilliance to those stars.
Are you prepared to be brilliant?
And here, we have the main pool.
[Erica] Whoa! Wow! It's so still and pristine.
I just wanna jump into it.
You like to disturb what is pristine?
Well, you can't. The pool is off-limits to employees.
Well, then, where do we go swimming?
The beach. Oh, but not the beach in front of the resort.
There's a public beach two miles up.
What is it?
-[grunts] -[chirps] Oh, it's just a gecko. They're all over the island.
They're harmless. It's like a small dinosaur.
And Erica, please, no more screaming. Only guests get to scream.
Hello, boys, meet Erica.
-Travis. Wayne, also in the band. -Hi.
-And then, of course, you know Barrington. -Yes.
Your sets are from 7:00 to 11:00 p.m. every night
and 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on weekends, unless there's a wedding.
-Oh, who sings if there's a wedding? -You do.
[chuckles] Wait, I mean, no one told me I'd be singing at weddings.
If singing at a wedding is a problem for you, I can organize flight options,
and you can make your own way back to New York at your own expense.
Seriously? I'm supposed to take a leap and move on from a failed singing career
and a failed engagement to be a wedding singer?
What?
You knew.
It was hard to spin, so…
-It-- [grunts] Amber! -Okay, but-- but think of it this way.
You're facing your demons, which is good.
[scoffs] Oh yeah. I am facing one right now.
Okay, okay, but how's the island?
[sighs] I mean, well, it's beautiful, and the air is wonderful,
and my sinuses are finally clear after five years,
but I'm about to get on stage and sing for people who are in love.
Erica! Erica! Look into the camera.
You cannot let what happened with Jason ruin the rest of your life.
And you certainly can't let him ruin you on love.
We'd like to invite Stephanie and David to the dance floor
for their first dance as husband and wife.
-[PA feedback squeals] -Whoo! You look so good.
I love this dress on you. It's so good.
Don't leave her. [crying]
People come here, and they spend a lot of money
to have a happy, joyful experience.
So from now on, your singing will be happy and joyful.
[softly] Hey, hey, hey, hey.
It's okay. It's okay.
We wouldn't be musicians if we didn't feel things so deeply.
You'll get your sea legs back.
Barrington, I am-- I'm just not in a good place.
-I don't think I can do this. -Sure, you can.
You just need the right song.
What kind of music makes you feel better?
-[water splashing] -[man screaming] Help! Help! Please help! -Hmm? -[man] Help! Somebody help! Help!
-Hmm? -[man] Help! Somebody help! Help! Help me, please! [grunts] Help!
Help! Help me, please!
-Help! I-- -Hold on!
-[Erica] I got you! -Help me, please!
-[man] Oh, thank you! -[gasps]
Oh, thank you.
Wait, wait. My GoPro! My--- My GoPro!
-[man coughing] -[man 2] Okay. [man 2] Okay, sir, you need to tell me where it hurts, all right?
[man 2] Okay, sir, you need to tell me where it hurts, all right?
Ma'am, are you okay?
-Yeah. -My camera. My beautiful camera.
My-- my whole trip is lost, my memories--
I saw it on the swim out. [chuckles]
-You saved it! -Okay. All right. All right. Okay.
Should we get a pic for the grid?
-What? -No? Okay.
Hey, fam, have you ever thought about the end?
I have. -I've had a life-changing experience. -[chuckles]
Yeah, thanks.
Wow. Hey, do you, um…
…know any restaurants around here? -[water trickles] -'Cause I could use a bite.
Yeah, and a drink too.
You know, I read about this coconut water-rum thing.
How are you so calm?
That man almost drowned. I almost drowned.
I was just lucky I saw you and could help out a bit.
You were so brave just running out there with no training.
Yeah? Well, you ran out there, too.
Do you have any training?
US military, Special Forces.
-Retired. -[chuckles]
Okay. All right.
-Well, I guess that makes, uh, more sense. -Caleb.
-I-- Erica. -[laughs] Nice to meet you.
So, are you here on vacation alone?
Uh, not quite a vacation. I'm here for my brother's wedding.
And I could finally make a family function after a while. So, here I am.
[Erica] Nice.
And you? I mean, what, a fisher or amateur lifeguard?
No, I'm here singing at a resort.
-Oh? -Yeah.
-A singer? -Yes.
Wow, that's cool.
-A spy. Well, that's cooler. -[laughs]
No, not a spy, just muscle for the spies.
Ah, okay. Well, spy security.
-Security for the spies. Yes. -I like that. Yes.
So, do you
wanna join me for that coconut-rum drink thing?
Um, I actually have to-- I gotta get to work soon.
Oh, okay. Um, well, I would love to check on you.
Gotta make sure that you're okay after your underwater aquatic rescue mission.
You know, it's a really small island.
I'm sure we will bump into each other.
-[Barrington] Hey. -Hey.
You're back early. Isn't it your night off?
It is.
And it was a weird day, but then I met someone I really liked.
-[gasps] -And then I bailed on him.
Oh, Erica.
Oh, he was a tourist or a spy. Uh, it's all good.
Oh, a spy.
No. Either way,
I probably would've never heard from him again. Yeah.
Wha--
[Caleb] I guess it really is a small island.
How did you find me?
Uh, I didn't. My brother's wedding is here.
Of course. [splutters]
I mean, not just… you're not just running around looking for me.
Actually, I was gonna call every hotel in town
asking if they had a singer named Erica.
No, you weren't.
I would have found you.
Oh, and right there is the happy couple now.
Oh, wow, you are very strong.
Wait, you're Caleb King?
-What? How do you-- -[spluttering]
Jason mentioned his military brother for years, but we never met.
You're that Erica?
Jason's Erica?
Not anymore. Yo, Caleb! We're taking the tour?
Yo, Caleb! We're taking the tour? Ooh, you can bring your little friend if you want-- Oh my God.
Ooh, you can bring your little friend if you want-- Oh my God.
What-- What are you doing? She can't be here. What-- -Hello Christian. -She works here.
-Hello Christian. -She works here.
-No. -[Caleb] Yes. -No. -[Caleb] Yes.
-Yeah. I work here. -Yeah.
-[Erica] Yeah. -Uh-huh.
And the gift bags are stored where?
The gift bags are stored in a staging area--
Baby, they have it handled. It's true.
Oh, and here comes my sister.
…down-home southern lady. So when I say 100% of the packaging
needs to be re-plantable seedlings, I mean it.
All right, bye. Okay, what's the next leg of the tour?
-We are waiting on the rest of your party. -Oh, they're right over there.
With…
Erica?
Yes. Erica. She will be singing at your wedding.
Oh my God. -Baby, you're leaking papaya. -Oh.
Wait, how do-- how do you know the wedding singer?
We, uh… We know Erica from New York.
What?
-Wait, what a small world. -[sister] No way.
-[bride] Look at you. -[Jason] Come on.
Erica! [laughs nervously]
What a surprise. Please don't say anything.
Hey, so, what are you doing here, so far away from where you normally are?
I-- I'm here singing. Um…
I think what brings you here is way more interesting.
-Uh, well, Erica, this is… -Yes, this is--
-I'm Beverly, Jason's fiancée. -Mm-hmm.
-Erica. -Nice to meet you.
-Uh-- -She and Jason--
-Yeah, we-- this, uh-- -You know each other from New York?
-Right. -Yeah. I see you know Christian, too.
Hmm.
-[chuckles] -We all used to live in the same building.
Yes! We got to know each other from, uh… [splutters] …when it was the club.
-[Jason] Yeah. Yeah. -A club?
-Yeah, it was a-- -Right, it wasn't really a dance club.
No. It was-- It was-- It was a-- It was a book club.
-Yeah. -[Christian] Yeah.
What luck running into Erica.
You don't often find employees in the lobby unless they are working.
It's such a treat that you're here.
I never get to meet Jason's friends, 'cause you guys are all up in New York.
And we've been so swamped. Can't get out of Charleston…
-[chuckles] -Oh, right. You moved to Charleston.
I was the first person he met when he moved there, right across the hall from me.
Wow, first person, huh?
-Wasn't that, like, a year ago? -[chuckles nervously]
But didn't give you a lot of time to plan a wedding, huh?
-Ha! -No, he didn't. But I-- I don't need it.
We just wanted it to be really intimate. So, for me, that's me, my sister Janelle,
and, uh, Jason's parents are coming, a few of our friends, but that's it. That's all we needed.
That is so sweet.
Hey, um, why don't you take, uh, Janelle to the spa,
and I'll come meet you for cell regeneration time.
-[Beverly] Thank you. -[both kiss]
Okay, okay, yes, it was so good to meet you.
Come on, Janelle, wanna show me your secret plans for the weekend?
-Okay, bye. Okay, bye. -Bye.
How could you?
[grunts] I can't believe you're getting married. I can't believe you're here!
What are you even-- What are you doing here?
Amber does social media for this resort. They needed a singer.
No wonder I kept gettin' ads about this place.
Wait. What happened with Cre and the album?
Cre scrapped it.
Someone leaked one of the tracks, and he just destroyed the whole thing,
along with my career.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
Yeah, me too.
But if Beverly finds out we were engaged, it'll cause so many problems.
-So please just-- -Wait, she doesn't know?
[spluttering] I could-- I could never seem to find the right time.
You know, I guess it's never really a good time to tell your new fiancée
how you walked out on your old fiancée a month before the wedding.
Wait a minute. I didn't walk out on you, okay?
You walked out every single day to the studio.
And you know what? By the time the job offer came up in Charleston,
And you know what? By the time the job offer came up in Charleston, there wasn't a relationship to even walk out on.
What? So you leave without talking to me, and I'm the bad guy?
Listen, you were never there to--
-You know what? Rehashing this-- -[scoffs] Rehash?
[chuckles] Oh no. You know-- You know what? It was never hashed.
You were just gone.
Okay. [claps hands]
I did not do 48 hours of therapy for this, okay?
-We're here for a few days. -Mm-hmm. We can avoid each other. Easy.
Yeah, mm-hmm. Don't expect me to sing at your wedding.
Good. I don't. Tell 'em you're sick or something. Call in.
-I will gladly do that. -Well, good!
-But you won't tell Beverly, right? -[yells] Go, go, go, go!
-[Barrington] Morning. -[screams]
-Hi. -[sighs]
Did you just hear that?
[spluttering] There's an echo in here, so, uh, I heard it.
Twice.
I guess you know now why I hate weddings.
Erica, why didn't you just tell us?
I didn't want to relive it.
-Does she really work here? -Dude, Amber does--
It's not funny, man!
-What are you gonna tell Beverly? -[Jason] Nothin'.
Beverly finds out I was engaged to Erica, she will lose it.
Okay, then, you gotta come clean. Look, if you get caught lyin'--
Okay, then, you gotta come clean. Look, if you get caught lyin'-- Okay, listen, I know you mean well,
but I don't need the Honor-Duty Captain America speech right now.
-Wow, Captain America? -Okay?
Wasn't Special Forces.
All I'm sayin'
is perfect honesty isn't always possible in 24-7 civilian life.
Hmm, yep. And no one is expecting you to be perfect,
just honest.
And sometimes, keeping things to yourself is the best way to go.
Otherwise, I'll end up with two ex-fiancées.
I wonder if I should try for a wedding commission from the hotel
since they found it through me.
-Amber! -I'm sorry.
This is not about business.
Look, I'll-- I'll conveniently come down with a cold the day of his wedding.
In the meantime, we'll just avoid each other.
What? This is a good, sane plan.
Look, I gotta get ready for work.
It's a big resort. It can't be that hard.
Erica! Girl, hey! [chuckles]
Fancy runnin' into you.
Yes. [chuckles] You know, it's-- it's too bad. I'm actually running late for, um…
The meeting about the music, the wedding music?
Right. That's right now.
-Yes, right now. -Yes, girl, come on. We'll go find Jason.
He's around here somewhere. It is such serendipity that you're here.
Yeah. That's definitely a word for it.
I gotta tell you. I-- I was so worried Jason was missing his life in New York, so to have you here is just--
[gasps] Oh, wait, you should come hiking with us tomorrow.
Oh no. You know, I'm-- I'm not much of a hiker. I-- Bad arches.
Oh, no, girl, please. It'll be fun.
We usually discourage employees from fraternizing with the guests.
Resort rules. Right. Sorry.
But guest wishes always come first, and I would hate to put two friends apart.
Yes, thank you!
-We-- We're more like book club members. -No. Thank you.
Bonne journée, Erica.
So, Beverly tells me you don't have your wedding song yet? Really?
Perhaps I can make a suggestion.
-Oh please. -Yeah?
Okay, great. How about "Unbreak My Heart" by Toni Braxton.
-Uh, for a wedding? -Mm. Mm-hmm. Yep.
Or, what about "Irreplaceable" by Beyoncé?
[chuckles] Uh, girl, that's a breakup song.
Mm. -I've always loved "Diamonds" by Rihanna. -Yeah!
-I've always loved "Diamonds" by Rihanna. -Yeah!
-Mm. -Yeah, I like that.
Wait! Wait! You know what will be a really good one?
"No One" by Alicia Keys.
-Yeah. -[Jason] Yeah?
Why?
Well, when you first moved in across the hall from me, you used to play that song on repeat, and so loud. [chuckles]
I found myself humming it before I met you, which…
I don't know, feels like a sign. -Does it? -Yeah.
'Cause, I kinda liked your first instinct, Rihanna, "Diamonds," better.
Aw, baby, you do?
-Yeah. -Mm.
[giggling] So sweet. Oh…
Yeah. Oh!
So we're settled. We got our wedding song. So, how many more of these we gotta pick?
Oh, do you mind if we, uh, pick the rest on the hike tomorrow?
-Need to get some rest. -Sure. Tomorrow's fine.
-Wait, what? What-- What do you mean? -Oh, I invited Erica to come hiking.
-You didn't? [chuckles] -[Beverly] Yeah, I did.
Caleb.
-Good morning. -Hi.
-It was quite a day yesterday, huh? -Mm, don't know what you're talkin' about.
-[chuckles] -Did you tell Jason we met?
[sighs] Yeah, I figured I would…
-No, I didn't. -[whispering] Ah, yes.
Okay. -Another thing to keep a secret. I got it. -[chuckles]
Hey, would you wanna take a walk later?
I've got, uh, wedding stuff now.
-Breakfast and a hike, but-- -I know. I'm actually headed there.
Beverly invited me.
Wow. -You think that's a good idea? -[chuckles]
-No. -[laughs]
-Definitely not. -Okay.
[Beverly] I can't believe you live here. You must wake up every day and pinch yourself.
I do. I do, but I'm still trying to get used to the lizards, though.
-We don't have those in the city. -Does proliferation have one "l" or two?
Uh, one.
Do you miss New York at all?
You know, I thought I would, but I don't mostly.
You know, there's nothing to really go back to.
Yeah, I blew a good thing back there, so… Too many memories.
Uh, no, you didn't. Cre blew it by not releasing the album.
-Hmm. -[Beverly] Jason told me about that. It's just awful.
Oh yeah, I mean, there's that, too, but I wasn't talking about my album.
-I was talking about my engagement. -[Beverly] Hmm.
-You were engaged? -Hmm, I was, but…
My fiancé got a really great job offer in a small town,
and he wanted to settle down, have kids,
and I wasn't ready to walk away from my dreams of becoming a singer.
A woman should never have to give up on her dream for a man.
-And the right man won't make her. -Mm.
Jason supports me one hundred percent in my dreams.
Representing the great state of South Carolina in the US Congress.
Ooh, okay, you're running for Congress.
Eventually. Right now, I work in policy development for the city council.
Wow, that is amazing, and with the support of your partner.
-[chuckles] -[Beverly] I am a lucky girl.
Yeah, I don't think he knew how important my dreams were to me.
-[Beverly] Hmm. -Or maybe he just didn't care.
Or maybe he thought your dreams were way more important than he was.
If he was the love of her life, he would have known.
Mm, that part.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe. Maybe. I don't know. [chuckles]
Wait. Do you still think he's the love of your life?
-[Barrington] Morning! -Ooh! Who's ready for an adventure?
-I am. Y'all, let's go. Let's go. -Yep. Okay.
-[Beverly] Oh, okay. -That might be a bit warm.
[Janelle] Does it have any Wi-Fi there? [Barrington] On the mountain? Uh, probably not. [Janelle] Beverly, you didn't tell me…
[Beverly] Jason, look at this. Oh my gosh!
-It's even better than I thought. -And we're here.
All right, you guys are gonna love this rope bridge.
The views will make you just go, "Wow!"
All right? One hand on the guide cables at all times.
Okie smokie?
-Okie smokie. -[Barrington] Let's do it!
-Whoo! -Okay, we got it. You first.
[Beverly] Hope nobody's afraid of heights.
You sure about this? Caleb, this isn't summer camp, huh. I'm a grown man.
All right.
-Whoo! Let's go. -Yeah, let's do it.
You can go on and follow Beverly.
Nah, you-- you go ahead. I'll pull up the rear.
You know, just in case a giant lizard comes for you.
I'd like to see that.
[Barrington] Guys ready? All right, let's go.
Let's do it.
-[whispering] You got this, Jay. -[Christian] Whoo!
That was fun.
I can still feel the pendulum of gravity.
-Hey. -Hmm. What? I'm a little parched.
What? No. Look at Jason.
-Camp Pulaski all over again. -Oh.
What? No, he's fine.
-It's easy. He's enjoying the view. -With his knees bucklin' like that?
Come on, don't look down.
[whispering] Don't look down.
[Jason softly] Okay.
And he's frozen.
-I'll go get him. -Oh.
I think someone's doin' that.
Jason.
It's Camp Pulaski again.
No, it's not.
Jason Xavior King, look at me.
You can do this.
I know you can.
Take my hand.
Just trust me.
Okay.
[Beverly] Baby!
-Baby, are you okay? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good.
It was just a moment, baby. It was just-- I'm-- I'm fine now.
Why didn't you say you're afraid of heights?
Babe, I would have kept you on solid ground. Oh, silly man.
[Jason] Hey, it was just a little thing I had when I was a kid.
Thought I was over it, but guess I'm not.
-[party music plays] -[Christian] Yeah!
All right! Everybody ready? We must toast to the gods.
-Salud! -[Jason] Salud! [al] Salud!
Jason! Are you feeling better, man?
I mean, that bridge had you rocked.
-Dude, I'm-- I'm-- I'm all right. -He's always had trouble with heights.
[Christian] Erica, you were so smooth how you went back out on that bridge
to talk our boy back to land. And you were so calm, too, before we knew he was having a hard time.
And you were so calm, too, before we knew he was having a hard time. -How'd you know? -Well, I was just closer. That's all.
-How'd you know? -Well, I was just closer. That's all. -Any of you guys would have done the same. -Not me.
-Any of you guys would have done the same. -Not me. You have a knack for helping people, like saving that guy at the beach.
You have a knack for helping people, like saving that guy at the beach.
-When was this? -[Erica chuckles] That's crazy.
Um, when I went for that walk after I landed.
You have to come with me and Janelle to my bachelorette night.
-Oh, yes! -[Beverly] We need that light around us.
You gotta come. You gotta come.
[Beverly] ♪ You know you wanna do it ♪ ♪ You know you wanna do it ♪
[squeals] Come on, please!
-Yes. -Yes!
-Yeah! -[Erica] I'll do it. I'll do it.
Um, but first, I need to get my booty to bed. It's been a long day.
-I'll walk you back. -Okay.
-[Janelle] The gentleman. -[chuckles]
So, what happened back there, huh?
Thought you were gonna keep our first little meeting to yourself.
-It slipped out. -[chuckles]
Okay, so, you were in secret missions in the Middle East,
but that just slipped out? All right.
Hey, look, why does it matter?
Earlier today, Beverly asked if Jason is the love of your life.
-[sighs] She asked if my nameless ex was-- -Well, do you?
What?
Do you think that Jason is the love of your life?
Because you're worried if he knows that we met on a beach.
Why do you care?
Look, he's my baby brother.
And we may not have been on the best footing for a while now,
but I still want what's best for him.
Well, we were together for four and a half years.
Those feelings don't just go away, you know.
I don't.
But being in the military wasn't ideal for long-term relationships.
I've never had that big type of love.
No international whirlwind love affairs?
Affairs, yeah.
Yeah. [clicks tongue]
Love…
no.
Did you really have to make a big deal about that bridge thing?
Bro, you froze.
It happens.
I mean, I was in the Coachella Ferris wheel once and--
Making me look like a wimp in front of everybody.
There's my brother there to see it.
No one's thinkin' of you like that.
Now he's probably off who knows where with Erica.
So what?
-So, what if I made a mistake? -Hmm.
-What if I should have married her? -You…
You said, "Marry Erica?"
Bro… [sighs]
I was out on that bridge today…
and she was with me.
Huh? Oh.
What if I made a mistake runnin' away from her?
I remember when you sang that song for me.
-What's going on, Jason? -This is a lot, you know?
My parents are gonna be here tomorrow. They haven't even met Beverly yet.
Wait, who meets their in-laws at their wedding?
-Well, you know how my mom is. -[chuckles] Okay.
-Well, you know how my mom is. -[chuckles] Okay. You must really wanna marry her to keep Naomi away until the wedding.
Wish you did that for me.
-I should go back to the stage. -Can we talk? Later?
I'm roped into a bachelorette party tonight, remember?
See if you can get away.
[smacks lips] I'll try.
[sighs] Okay.
[sighs] What am I doing?
What are you doing?
He said, and I quote, "I thought I was over it, but I'm not."
Yeah, about his fear of heights.
Well, he-- he already called off one wedding.
Girl. Yours.
Okay, I gotta go. I'm meeting with Beverly and her sister at the bar.
Have you lost your damn mind?
I thought the plan was to avoid them.
I tried.
Fake a case of diarrhea. No one questions diarrhea.
-Ew! Gross. -[hang up tone beeps]
Okie dokie, who's ready for some karaoke?
All right, first up, we have the bride-to-be…
-Beverly! -[cheering]
That's my sister, y'all. She gettin' married.
Okay. [clears throat]
[man] All right! Come on!
-Bet you didn't see that comin'. -♪ …boom, boom, badoom, boom, bass ♪
-Whoo! Oh my God! Yes! -Whoo!
So, Jason, this is all you wanna do? Obviously, it's your bachelor party.
You know what? Not really feelin' in a party mood after that business yesterday.
What business?
Oh, no, no, no. Let's not go there.
"What business?" I have one little height-related episode…
And we're going there.
…and you go and you pick at it.
Jason, look, you've always had this in your head.
I'm sorry for being born first.
You look down on me just because you're so used to being the hero in everything.
Hey, hey, you know I found a brother on 23andMe?
Look, but I am not sorry for being good at what I like to do, man.
Leaving no space for me?
I couldn't even get past your shadow in the chess club.
His name's Raymond.
It's not enough that you're this big, bad military hero everybody can worship.
Okay, look, Jason, do you know that Mom used to email me pictures of your cubicle up to your corner office?
She sends those to everybody. She sends it to everybody 'cause she loves you. She's proud of you.
You are my brilliant, little brother, man.
And no one is judging you,
or comparing you to anyone.
Look, make your own choices and stick by them.
That's what being a man is.
[scoffs] Okay. Don't lecture me about what being a man is.
-I know you're not standing… -I'm walking down the aisle.
-That's manly. -No. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Hey! Hey!
You're brothers!
We all want what's best for each other. Let's not forget that.
Nor should we forget
that I spent $6,000 on this 1974 single malt scotch.
-Okay, now, that's insane. -Yeah, yeah, but we will drink it.
-We will absolutely drink it. -Yes.
Good, good. This cost a lot of money, and I don't even like whiskey.
[Christian] Get off your phone!
Work stuff.
[imitating Jason] "Work stuff."
Tequila shots for everybody!
-Especially you. -[man] Thank you.
Here you go.
One, two, three.
-I'll be right back. -Okay.
-[Beverly] You better come back. -You better.
-[blips] -[phone chimes]
-Hey. -Jason--
I was walking back to my room and then your room,
and then I couldn't decide, so I chose the ground.
[sighs] Thanks.
Everything's happening so fast, you know. Um…
And it's really… It's really bringing up a lot for me. You know?
Me too.
[Jason] And, um…
you think I left because I chose the job over you.
But in reality, it's because I thought you didn't need me,
not like you need your music.
That's what got you through your day.
I didn't think I could compete with that.
[sighs] Well, I'm-- I'm sorry I made it feel like a competition.
[whispering] And I'm sorry for hurting you, Erica.
[sighs] Jason,
these last six weeks, I have watched people get married,
and they all looked so happy.
The thought of having to watch you
get married to someone, and it's not me…
Come here. Come here. Come here. It's okay.
Erica! Erica, girl, where have you been?
Janelle had to step out for a work emergency.
Get back up here 'cause I'm singing "Shallow" next. Both parts!
[squeals] Come on! Come on! Come on!
Where's my tiara?
Uh, you-- you gifted it to the bartender for her kindness and grace.
[laughs] Oh, yeah.
You should probably drink some more of your water, please.
Oh, I have another one back home in Charleston.
You know I was Miss Charleston?
-Get out of town. Wow. -[chuckles]
[gasps] Oh my God. -Oh my God. -Mm.
I just thought of something.
I'm really gonna be a queen
because I'm marrying a king.
[laughing] 'Cause Jason's last name is… King.
Yep. I get it. I get it. [chuckles]
You're not gonna keep your last name, huh?
Uh, for my political career, of course.
But I think-- I think in my personal life, I'm-- I'm just gonna be Mrs. King.
Oh my God, I can't help it. I am so traditional.
I want the white picket fence.
I want two babies.
I want church on Sunday.
And I just love feeding people, you know.
My mom and dad used to have these huge Sunday night dinners, right?
Every Sunday after church.
And then, when they were gone… [chuckles] Um…
Anyway, I wanna do the same thing.
And-- And I have these two crock pots, right,
and Jason has this one rice cooker that he loves.
And I-- I can just smell the home I wanna make with him. [laughs]
I can literally hear our kids just playing on the swing on the wraparound porch.
[laughs] I know that sounds so weird. I'm sorry.
No, no. Actually… It's actually… It's really nice.
Here, I-- I am so sorry your fiancé broke up with you.
But you know what? Screw him. He's lost the best thing he'll ever have.
-I don't know about that. -No, I do.
You know, the men in our lives, they think they're our everything. -Although they are not. -[both laugh]
Amen to that.
That actually needs to be official. I think I wanna legislate that one day.
[Erica laughs] I'm-- I'm sure you will.
-Okay [laughing]. -[Erica] Okay.
Oh shit! My name is Beverly Strattford, and I approve this message. Okay?
Right. Yes, girl. [grunts]
Oh, man.
-I'm gonna leave this here, just in case. -Mm-hmm.
-I'm gonna leave this here, just in case. -Mm-hmm. -Okay? -Yeah. Yeah.
-All right. You sure you're okay? -I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Was that your phone or mine?
-Mine. -Oh…
Who's texting you this late, Ms. Erica?
Just one of the band confirming rehearsal tomorrow.
Oh, will I see you at the rehearsal dinner tomorrow?
I have to work.
[smacks lips] Well, then I will see you at the wedding!
-[giggles] -Okay.
Oh, Erica.
Girl, I'm so happy I met you. I really feel like we're becoming friends.
Good night.
Oh… [sighs]
-[clicks] -[tapping]
Hey.
-Hi. -Hi.
Uh, what are you-- What are you doing out here?
-What are you doing here? -[chuckles]
Well, it is finally cool enough to go for a run. So… here I am.
I like to meditate at this time of the night.
Oh.
[Erica] How was the bachelor party?
Well, we just smoked cigars,
and sat by an infinity pool,
and drank overpriced whiskey.
-[both chuckle] -How was your thing?
Mine was…
It was actually fun. I have to admit.
-[chuckles] -Jason left us early.
Said he had to go work, but probably just snuck off to be with Beverly.
So, do you wanna go meditate?
Ah, let's-- let's give it a try.
Okay. After you.
-No, I can't believe that. Okay, this one. -Uh…
Believe it or not…
-The trombone. -[laughs] I knew you would say that.
All right, how about this one?
Yeah, that is the scar that changed my entire life.
-I blew it out on my last mission. -Oh.
And just like that, the only life that I know-- I-- [sighs]
I knew, really is gone.
Not many people can see those types of scars.
Hmm. [chuckles] True.
I look at that scar and think to myself, it has put me on a path,
and I don't know where it's gonna lead.
No one is coming to pick me up to take me to my next mission.
And I keep imagining my family and… [chuckles] …everyone…
expecting me to know what I'm gonna do next, but…
I don't.
And for the first time in my life, I have no plan.
Maybe you should own that.
Yeah. Don't worry about what everybody expects of you.
I don't know how to do that.
Neither do I.
I guess.
[sighs] It's harder trying to get over what you expect of yourself.
Yeah, that's the one.
'Cause I definitely expected that album would be my big break.
-[sighs] -I'm sorry.
I'm not sure that I am.
But I do know that the music is still with me.
And though I have no plan…
[sighs] …I know I'm meant to sing. That's why God gave me this voice.
Well, you can't argue with God.
No.
Especially not when he makes a sunrise like that.
[Erica] Wow.
Okay, I… [clears throat] …should go get some sleep before my parents get here.
Seeing my mom for the first time in a few years requires at least four hours.
[chuckles] Oh wow.
-Um, I'm gonna go… -Yeah.
…hide.
See you later.
-Before your mom sees me. [chuckles] -Yeah.
-Then the sand's gonna hit the fan. -[chuckles]
-All right. -Yeah.
-Good night! -See you later.
-Bye. -Bye.
I've got to be real.
Today's a very difficult day for me.
I'm losing my baby.
My blanket in the shade.
Oh, Mom!
I used to use his little body as a shawl on picnics.
-Okay. -[chuckles]
And it's been cold without him.
Attention! Attention. Attention, everyone!
Oh God. Oh no.
Attention, everyone!
There's something I have to say.
Okay.
I'm losing my baby…
Come on, say it. Say it.
…to a siren's call.
-What? -Oh, Jesus!
And in times like these,
I turn to Bette Midler for the right words.
Oh no!
What does Bette Midler have to do with anything?
Ma.
Ma.
-♪ Than an eagle ♪ -Stop her!
Mama?
-♪ With you as the wind beneath my wings ♪ -Ma.
Oh, is that a microphone?
Oh my God, she's gonna ruin my wedding. Jason, don't let her ruin my wedding!
-Oh no! -Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
-[Naomi] …for the people in the back. -Mom, Mom. Hey, hey, hey… Um… Okay. Wow.
-She was just getting started, too. -[phone vibrating]
[Caleb] You've given these people enough of your gift.
Uh-uh. We cannot be stingy with our songs of love and devotion, baby.
I know, but it's my turn to toast Jason.
And I've really been looking forward to it.
Oh, oh, well, for you, baby.
For you.
[clears throat] Hello, everyone. I am Caleb King,
Jason's older brother.
Now, I don't-- I don't know much about relationships.
I've never been married, but I know what it's like to be committed wholeheartedly.
And that is what you two are about to do tomorrow.
Commitment is an active breathing thing.
Too many people walk away easily…
give up easily.
But the strength and love that it takes to choose commitment,
well, that… that is something to look up to.
And I do.
So… [clears throat] …from everyone at this table,
congratulations, Beverly and Jason.
[all] Cheers!
-Thank you. -[Jason] Cheers.
You should really ask who's there before you open the door.
What are you doing here?
It's over.
-Jason called off the wedding? -What?
No. The rehearsal dinner.
But… [sighs] …I think he's having cold feet.
So I figured I'd keep watch.
In case he tries anything stupid.
What do you mean by s-- stupid? [chuckles]
-You have another one of those? -[both laughing]
Okay, "Wind Beneath My Wings" is actually a good choice,
but I would take Naomi for more of a "I Will Always Love You."
Yeah. That kinda mother-in-law. Just a little bit more menacing.
-[laughs] -Yeah, with a headscarf.
Running off the plane like Whitney at the end of The Bodyguard.
-She has one of those headscarves, too. -Yes, I bet.
I bet you're glad you don't have to deal with her?
Maybe.
Or… [sighs] …maybe I would have grown to like her.
You would have.
I mean, look, she's
crazy…
…but all that drama is just how she knows how to show love.
You know?
Yeah. I guess things could definitely be worse.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
You mind if I take these off?
Oh, so you really are staying, aren't you?
That is the plan.
You were expecting Jason, weren't you?
I don't know.
-Hmm. -Maybe.
You want me to leave?
No, not really.
You know what…
always cheers me up?
Okay, samurai movies are what cheer you up?
Yeah. Sure do.
All right. Okay.
All right. So there's one guy. He pulls out a sword on another guy.
And then they clash steel, and then what?
-What happens? -[laughs]
I mean, how does that guy know he's slicing up the right guy?
Well, see, they have a code of honor that they live by.
-Well, okay, I wish life was that easy. -Mm.
-Well… -[both sigh]
…it's not supposed to be.
I mean, look, the most interesting samurais,
the ones you root for,
are complicated heroes.
-Hey! -Hey. -I thought you were in your sister's room. -I was.
-I thought you were in your sister's room. -I was. -Wait. Where are you going? -I was just gettin' some air.
-Wait. Where are you going? -I was just gettin' some air.
Okay. Um…
-Can I… -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Baby, I'm sorry I didn't believe you when you said your parents were a lot.
And I'm so sorry that I was so cranky at dinner.
I wanna marry you more than anything in the world,
but I can't lie.
Baby, I'm nerv-- I'm nervous.
[softly] Hey. Hey.
I'm nervous, too.
-Really? -Yeah, so nervous.
Okay, I mean, maybe we can just be nervous together.
Deal.
Oh.
-You asleep? -[groans]
-I was. -[groans]
Thank you for staying.
Of course.
-[inhales] We should get some sleep. -All right. Yep.
Um, I can take the couch. You can have the bed.
No. You… take your bed. I'll take the couch.
[softly] Okay. Here.
Ooh, yeah.
-Kidding! -[both laugh]
Oh, my goodness!
I can't believe you weren't going to say anything, though.
Speechless!
-[Erica] Goodnight! -Night.
Coming!
Erica, I need to talk to you. Jason, um, this isn't exactly the right time. I…
What are you doin' here?
Look… Jason…
-[chuckles] I knew somethin' was goin' on. -What? No. We were…
-We were just watching Netflix and fell-- -Oh, Netflix and chill.
Now I feel real good about the situation.
He doesn't even know what that means, Jason.
I-- I know what it means. I know what it means.
But it was-- it was just Netflix, all right? There was no chill.
Jason, even if it was, you're getting married today, remember?
Erica, goin' after him isn't gonna help either one of you right now.
Erica?
Erica?
Erica, you should be with someone who is sure that you're the only choice for him.
That man is not Jason.
Jason!
Hey! Okay, you stop this right now.
This craziness stops right now.
-We're not running through the sand. -Oh, how… My brother? Really?
Nothing happened.
But are you-- are you really jealous, or are you having cold feet, Jason?
I don't know.
I screwed everything up with you.
What's gonna stop me from screwin' everything up with her, too?
We screwed things up for each other.
Jason, the truth is,
if you hadn't called off the wedding, I probably would have.
Then…
Then what is all of this?
Nostalgia.
Coincidence. Guilt. Uh, I don't know.
[sighs] Maybe all of the above.
But if this was right…
and you were the love of my life, then it would not be this hard.
I love her.
I was on my over to tell you that.
Then I saw Caleb, and I just lost it. I just--
Look at me. I'm gonna screw this up. I'm gonna screw this up.
-I know I'm gonna screw this up-- -No. Look. No. Listen. No, you're not!
Beverly loves you.
You love her.
I feel like you're walkin' me across another bridge.
Well…
we got across the last one, right?
Yeah.
-We did. -Mm-hmm.
Come on. Let's get you married.
Yes, big sis.
Ma chérie. C'est trop bien. [chuckles]
You look so beautiful!
You like the sun behind you?
Comfortable with those shadows?
No, I love the shade. These are just some candid shots. So…
The photographers gonna come any minute. Don't… Any second…
Maybe if she stands with her better side forward.
-[Janelle] Okay, careful now. -[Beverly] Thank you, Ms. King.
Thank you.
-[Janelle] Wow. All right then. -Is that Erica with Jason?
Why on earth would my son invite his ex to his wedding?
His ex?
Thank God he had the good sense to call that off.
But this staying friends with your ex, ugh…
When?
When did he break up with her?
-About a month before the wedding. -Okay, "the wedding." Oh.
-When were they engaged? -Last year.
[Janelle] Little hussy messed with the wrong family.
She's gonna curse the day she ever came to the wedding.
You better call the ambulance.
-[shouting] Call the Mauritian police! -[dramatic music playing]
Erica!
Janelle?
-You lying, scheming, two-faced-- -It's not what you think!
[Janelle] I know where you live.
Where is she?
Erica! Erica, I need your help.
Beverly's sister called all out of breath. Beverly has canceled the wedding.
Oh no!
Yes, and she's run away. Nobody can find her. It's terrible.
Not for us. They still have to pay for the wedding, but I feel bad.
She was breathing out a lot of emotion.
If you can help, I would be eternally grateful.
Of course. Okay. I'll-- I'll-- I'm on it. I'm on it.
The cabanas are the other way. Have you forgotten your ground tutorial?
Oh, c'est impossible.
Yeah, you better run, Erica!
-Oh, this is not a good time. -Drive!
[Beverly] Get out!
See what I mean? You get out of this van right now! I know that you and Jason were engaged.
You get out of this van right now! I know that you and Jason were engaged.
I know you've been lying to me this whole time.
Make her get out of this van!
-Wait. Let me fix this. -How could you possibly fix this?
-Look, you deserve the truth. You do. -The truth.
But-- But let me-- let me share this truth a little bit further down the road.
-What? -Further down. Just keep driving.
-[Beverly] Take me to the airport. -There's been a misunderstanding.
A mis-- I saw the two of you on the beach-- Know what? Never mind.
I will give you $200 if you throw her out of this van.
-[Barrington chuckles] -Okay? Five, if it is still moving.
Don't even think about it.
If you don't throw her out of this van right now, I'mma start swingin'.
[Barrington] All right. All right. Okay, this is not part of my job.
[Barrington] All right. All right. Okay, this is not part of my job. Barrington. Wait, wait. What are you doing?
Barrington. Wait, wait. What are you doing?
-[Barrington] I just… [clears throat] -No. No, no, no, no.
Okay, I bruise easily.
-Okay. -[Beverly] No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
-[Erica] Barrington! -No! Don't leave me here with her.
-[Erica] Come back! She's crazy! -You cannot leave me here!
-[Erica] Come back! She's crazy! -You cannot leave me here! -[Erica] Barrington! -Barrington!
You and Jason ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
Beverly! Beverly, I swear, nothing happened between us.
Why should I believe you?
You've been lying to me this whole time.
Okay, look…
Okay, we have history,
and we should have told you, but-- but-- but we were-- we were both afraid that…
Well, this would happen!
I feel like such an idiot.
No, no. Please, please, look, look, look, Jason and I are the idiots.
-Maybe you do belong together, then. -No, we don't.
Because you're his perfect match.
-[sighs] -You know that dream that you have?
The both of you have?
The-- The porch swing.
The children.
I-- I got hives just listening.
Well, why were you sneaking behind my back, then?
Because we were blindsided.
Truly, wh-- what are the odds of him showing up here to get married?
Actually, they're pretty good considering Amber's really good at manipulating social media algorithms,
but-- but still.
I'm not some country fried-green-tomato idiot, okay?
No, of course, you're not.
Well, the truth is…
Beverly, I never got closure.
[sighs] I was happy, and I was hustling,
and all of a sudden, Jason was gone.
And I was sad,
but I was gonna be okay.
I was gonna make my music.
Because the love of my life since I was a little girl was music.
I still thought my dream was coming true.
But that dream was never getting married to Jason,
and that should have been my dream.
It should have been it.
It was my dream.
Then why are you giving up so easily?
Just the idea that Jason wasn't sure about me,
even just for a moment,
it hurts.
I know, and I'm sorry.
But Jason is so sure.
And if you don't believe me, just-- just please, just go hear him out.
Give him a chance to prove that he is still the man of your dreams.
I-- I do believe you.
I do.
But come on, th-- this isn't how I envisioned my wedding day.
Well, your wedding day isn't over.
Let's get you back there, and you go marry the man that you love.
[sighs] You're coming with me.
No. No.
Yeah,
because you need your closure.
And I need someone to sing at my wedding.
Okay.
I would be honored.
Come here.
This hug is gonna have to wait. I'm, uh, I'm gonna go get Barrington.
-Everything's gonna be okay. Hang on. -[Janelle] Erica!
-We'll-- We'll get back to the resort-- -[grunts]
Janelle, no!
[Barrington] We are gathered here today to witness the union
of Beverly Strattford and Jason King.
The bride and groom have chosen to recite their own vows. -Should be interesting. -[chuckles]
-[Barrington] Jason. -[sighs]
Beverly,
when people say, "I love you,"
I think they focus on the "love" part, and they don't recognize the "you" part.
When I say "you,"
I mean every moment of you.
The you that hums when she stirs her tea.
The you that gets so excited by public policy.
The you that makes me lunches every day before I go to work.
The one-day-mother-of-my-children you.
And that smile,
that washed my heart with sun the first day I met you,
I love and I appreciate that you.
And I am so thankful and so honored
I get to love all of you,
from now until eternity.
Beverly, I love you.
[Barrington softly] Wow. Ooh…
Um, it was beautiful.
Whoo. Beverly.
I had a poem that I wrote for you.
Um, and it has imagery and…
Doesn't matter.
Baby.
-I love you. -I love you, too.
You are my dream.
Sorry. [chuckles]
And now, if there's anyone here who knows why
these two should not be joined together in holy matrimony….
Don't you even. Jason is not your husband.
This man to the left in the blue leisure suit, that's your husband.
It's lapis. [clears throat]
-[softly] Mom. -I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss, again.
-Yeah! [howls] -[inaudible] That's my man.
-That went perfect! -Come on!
-Wow! Oh my God. -Yeah.
-Okay. -[Christian] Classy for the ladies.
-Hey, I love you guys. -Cheers.
-Cheers! -Love, prosperity…
-All right. Cool, well… -All that.
You ain't even-- Oh, my goodness. Okay.
You got it on my leg.
[Christian] I'm sorry. I'm really excited. I'm really excited.
You seem happy.
You know, for a while there, I doubted I'd ever be again,
but look at me. [chuckles]
I am.
You know what? Hold that thought.
Beverly.
Jason.
Now, I know you wanted your wedding song to be "Diamonds,"
and I know that's a beautiful song.
But to me, it doesn't capture the love that you have for each other,
and it doesn't express the love that I have for the both of you
as my friends, so here it goes.
-What's she gonna do? -Yeah…
I'll be back.
[Erica] Okay, this must be important
because you have called me 5 times in the last 20 minutes.
Have you seen Cre's Instagram? He's going back into the studio.
Hmm. Good for him. Maybe he'll actually release this one.
You should get in touch with his people. This could be your second chance.
There'll be other chances.
Okay. I'm about to take another leap. I'll call you later.
-Okay, girl. Bye! -Bye!
-[chuckles] -You ready?
Let's do this.
Come on.
Grace first.
You know better.
Father, we are gathered here to share this food in your name.
Bless this food into our bodies, O Lord.
Bless our hearts and all that we do, O Lord,
Bless our hearts and all that we do, O Lord, so that we may walk in your name--
Who will that be at this time?
I have no idea.
No.
Leave my family alone.
Theodore.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Leave them out of this.
Your quarrel is with me.
Let's go outside, take a walk,
and handle our business.
-[man] Please. -[shakily] No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[softly] Please, I'm begging you.
-No! -[body thuds]
[boy screaming] No! No! No! No!
[boy crying] No! No! No!
No! No! Please!
No!
No! No, no, no, no, no! No!
[in Spanish] Father Esparza?
I'm here for confession…
and the collection.
You know what happens when you're late with my coins.
[man in English] What possesses a man
to paint a scorpion on his hand?
Excuse me?
A snake, I understand that.
The Garden of Eden, the Bible, etcetera.
But a scorpion?
Well, that puzzles me.
Who are you?
Just a man.
Here to kill the Scorpion.
Jesus Cortez.
[Cortez] Those were, uh, different times.
Whatever happened between you and I must have been a long, long time ago.
No.
No.
Please.
Please.
I…
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
[priest] Is it over?
This is a wanted man.
Turn his body in, you'll get $5,000 for your church.
[spluttering] Why aren't you taking him in yourself?
I'm worth ten.

Mary, the only thing that mean anything to me in this world now
is you.
And what about the Nat Love Gang?
Ain't been much of a gang since you left.
Just me, Jim, Bill.
Next time they come around, I'll sort it.
You know, I can almost believe that.
Almost, 'cause you didn't get the last one, did you?
You can say his name, Mary.
What about Rufus Buck?
Rufus in Yuma for the rest of his natural life.
For a man like him, that's worse than death.
As long as that man draw breath,

Whoa, easy, Nat. Listen to what the man got to say first.
So he can tell me the same stories he been tellin' you?
Why the fuck would I lie?
Rufus Buck is behind bars for the rest of his life.
-[man] He gettin' out. -[cocks gun] How?
Damned if I know. I just know it's so.
All the gangs are gettin' set to ride for him again.
Half that take was his. [chuckling]
And you fools took his money.
You think Rufus Buck was gonna let you keep half that money,
and you callin' me a fool?
I guess I am. [chuckles]
On your feet.
Exhale.
Now get out of here.
Leave.
What you doin'? We coulda killed the last of the Crimson Hoods.
It's called the Crimson Hood Gang. You think that's the last one?
Yeah.
I woulda bet my left six-shooter he was about to kill that boy.
If that man telling the truth, Nat just did him a whole lot worse.
[driver] What the hell are you doin' out here?
That ain't no way to board a train, you damn stupid ni--
You know, he might coulda said nincompoop.
We ain't no nincompoop.
If they say something that even start with "N,"
they gonna meet the same fate.
Let 'em see your faces.
All right, stay calm, everybody. Don't… Hey, don't touch nothin'.
My name is Cherokee Bill.
Now let it be known that I don't particularly enjoy violence.
That being said, you are currently in the company of extremely violent individuals.
Try some of that.
-Ugh. Shit. -[women gasp]
So, don't do no stupid shit. All right?
Get off this train now, you motherless scum.
You must be the hero.
Great Spirit, why is there always one?
You're rude.
I might actually enjoy inflicting violence on you.
But who knows?
Maybe you'll win.
Let's see.
See my point?
Now, step aside so that we may conclude our business here without further ado.
Stop right there.
No.
[nervously] I said stop.
Put the weapon down, boy.
Or we kill everybody on this train.
-I said put the gun down. -[passengers gasping]
It's okay.
Are there any more soldiers on that car?
There are.
Exactly how many?
Thirty.
[gasps] Ten!
See, that's all you had to say.
Open the door.
I said open the damn door.
Here we are.
My dear battalion.
I imagine you have all your artillery aimed at the door.
I'd like to inform you that in front of that door
lies one of your very own troops.
Any bullets coming through that door will hit him first, okay?
State your name, criminal.
Oh, I'm not a criminal, sir, um, but my name is Cherokee Bill.
What's your name?
My name is Officiant of the Goddamn Law.
You let that soldier go immediately.
Leave this train now and no one will be hurt.
Oh, that sounds like fear talking, Mr. Officiant of the Goddamn Law.
And we done already hurt a couple people.
You're just going to let us get away Dred Scott free?
State your purpose, bastard.
Also, I'm not a bastard.
But you've got something we want. We've got a soldier that you want.
Now, I suggest we make a peaceful trade and everybody lives to see another day.
-Sound dandy? -Just let the boy go.
-[screams] -Jake!
I'm okay, Pa!
That's just a flesh wound, sir.
You got ten seconds to put your guns down and open up this damn door,
or your little kin here shall perish.
Harm him further and I will kill every last one of you godless sons of bitches.
Goddamn, Trudy. You know I like my countdowns.
My apologies, sir. My friend here doesn't like arithmetic.
Be that as it may, seven seconds.
Six.
-Lay down your rifles. -Five.
I said lay them down. Four.
Three.
Well, all right. Thank you kindly. Go ahead and walk, boy.

What's this about?
Well, he came to us with a proposition.
Kill a particular Officiant of the Goddamn Law.
A man so crooked that even the government is embarrassed by his misdeeds.
Apparently, you and your men wiped out an entire town,

In here, though, I be the sheriff, and that make Ms. Mary the marshal.
And the marshal say, "Don't nobody come in here gunned up,
or they might could get gunned down."
My badge begs to differ.
Check your gun-belt.
Excuse me.
So how you plan on taking me in, Marshal?
Staring me to death? How about just death?
Just a pipe.
You mind?
Never known you to touch it.
Only after I kill a man.
Or before.
I was on the trail of the Crimson Hood Gang
on account of a bank robbery in Kansas City.
Turned out somebody got to 'em before me.
You know I don't rob banks, Marshal.
But you rob them that do, which is all the same to me.
-Texas. -What?
I was in Texas at the time of that robbery.
How you know when it took place?
Whenever any bank robbery took place, I was in Texas.
Unless, of course, the robbery took place in Texas.
Way I hear it, some of them boys with the Crimson Hoods
are part of a new Rufus Buck Gang, Nat.
Rufus in Yuma.
He out. But you knew that already, didn't you?
Why you sitting here monologuing, drinking up my whiskey,
when you should be out rounding up your little deputies?
'Cause he been pardoned, Nat.
Rufus Buck been absolved of his countless depredations.
Seeing as I've been scouring the terrain looking for bank robbers and such,
that particular piece of news failed to reach me.
What they sayin'?
Something about guns, killin'.
Why you let that kid take my gun? What kinda stupid rule is that?
-Should be four guns pointing at-- -Shut up, Pickett.
You shoot, he dead.
You miss, all y'all die.
You, come here.
Take these cuffs. Cuff this man.
Or I put three in his chest right now, lessen the trouble.
Go on.
Tell this young buck to back up.
Easy, Jim.
Everybody in here know who I am.
I'm taking Nat Love to Fort Smith to be tried.
Anybody try to follow me, y'all know what I do.
Come on.

♪ Going to the promise land ♪
Cherokee Bill, Ms. Smith, top of the morning to you both.
Mr. Buck, glad to have you back in Redwood, sir.
Any word on the take from the Kansas City bank?
The Crimson Hoods took it for $25,000.
But they were ambushed before they got here.
Everybody knows it's suicide to take from us.
Someone obviously disagrees.
Goddamn it. That just put us right back where we started.
How we supposed to build a Mecca without any bricks?
[Trudy] We gonna have to take it out of our own bank.
[man] We don't have that type of money, Trudy.
We only got a few pennies over $2,500.
What did he say?
-[man] 2,500-- -I heard you.
-[Trudy] Wiley. -[Cherokee Bill] Yeah.
[Rufus] Sure is hot, ain't it?
What's up, little man?
-You wanna see something? -[boy] Yeah.
Watch this now. Don't take your eyes off it.
Oh, it's still there! [laughs]
Rufus Buck.
Look at you.
Relic of yesteryear with nothin'.
And you think you can roll into my town and take what belong to me?
Who the fuck you think I am, huh?
Ain't nobody scared of you and ain't nobody runnin'.
I'm a sinister motherfucker too.
One click of my finger and you disappear.
So I suggest you leave…
before I finish my steak.
-And if you even think about sticking-- -[knocking on door]
Come in.
What is it, Carson?
Sheriff, Mr. Buck wants to see you out front.
Tell that man I ain't got nothing to say to him.
It wasn't a request.
Wiley Escoe.
Rufus.
[Rufus] You wanna sell this town while I rot in prison?
The world you knew is gone.
There's a flood comin'.
Do you think you can hold onto this place when it hit?
At least I know enough to get mine and get out.
Kill me…
and you'll have nothing.
You know, a man like you will have us all subservient
till the end of our days
so's long as you can buy yourself a house,
a badge, and them goddamn gold teeth.
You want to do this here?
[Wiley] There you go. That's what you want, right?
That's what you came here for?
I won't disappoint you. Come on.
That's what you want. Want some more?
You want some more, right? You want some more?
[Rufus] Come here, motherfucker.
Here you go.
Oh shit. I done hit gold.
Hey, boy. Come here. Come, get that gold. Get that gold.
All right. Tell your mama you rich now! Go ahead!
[Rufus] Now, I ain't gonna kill you, Wiley.
[echoing] You and I were friends once.
But know this. Redwood will never be yours, never.
Never.
Matter of fact, you ain't welcome here no more.
Now…
I want you to vacate immediately or die where you lay.
Say what?
That's right.
You coulda taken these off a while back. Yep.
Tell me something. How you know Rufus will be in Redwood?
[Nat] He's taking that money from them Crimson Hoods.
That's where he'll be.
Now you teaming up with a marshal to bring him in.
I ain't bringing him in. I'm bringing him down.
And we ain't teaming up, old man.
Your life's expendable, Marshal. My gang's ain't.
Shit, since we're out here, I oughta tell you…
I was fixin' to kill you…
when you and your fellas brought in Rufus.
A lot of men be fixin', son.
They always seem to die before they get the job done.
Just for the record…
I took Rufus in alone.
[Nat] Mary.
I figured you'd be halfway to Fort Smith by now.
You can put that gun down, Marshal. This ain't a ambush.
You, on the other hand, might wanna keep yours handy.
Do you think I'm stupid enough to fall for that bullshit y'all pulled in my saloon?
I don't want you mixed up in this no more.
Then you shoulda told me so.
I must confess to some raw feelings myself.
This ain't no road to ask a friend to travel.
Now you take that money we took off them Crimson Hoods
and you buy that ranch you always blabbing about. Hmm?
That's mighty generous of you, but that ain't how this gang work.
Take stays in the usual place, ready to be shared three ways when we come back.
Ain't no coming back from this.
Now get out of here.
All of you. This ain't your fight.
You take on the Devil himself, you gonna need more than you and the marshal.
I seen the Devil, and Rufus Buck ain't him.
Devil's white.
You got a reason you wanna die, Jim?
Outside of you saving me from this?
Besides, Monroe said Cherokee Bill run with Rufus.
Every time I speak on my speed,
a motherfucker wanna pull Cherokee Bill out they ass.
I'ma put a end to that argument once and for all.

Out-speed ain't a word, and Clarence ain't no book.

-Hey. -You left these on my wall, Mr. Love.

[Rufus] How do I look?
[Trudy] All right.
Everybody out there?
Just about.
How could you do it?
Leave all of this to Wiley?
If you were runnin' Redwood,
who woulda kept the operation goin'?
Who else woulda kept all them gangs in line?
Look, I know that Wiley got his ways, but he was loyal once.
Loyalty is a virtue, Rufus.
Till it ain't.
You loyal to me?
See these folk here?
Either they can't see it or they don't want to.
But I believe in what you're doing.
This place can be the promised land for us.
And as long as that so, ain't nothing I won't do to see it through.
You tell them.
[Trudy] Citizens of Redwood.
A new day is dawning.
As by now you have doubtless learned,
the territory will officially open up for settlement.
Now they say everything we own is gonna stay our own.
But you know as well as I do how much that's worth.
See, your land, your businesses, your homes
has all been promised to the highest bidders
by your one-time sheriff, Wiley Escoe.
Now, Mr. Buck can prevent this from happening.
But in order for us to do that, it's necessary that we levy a tax.
-[crowd muttering] -At what cost to us?
-$50,000. -[man] Ooh.
You could scrape every penny from every living soul in this town,
and it wouldn't come near to that.
You got us between a rock and a hard place.
How long you been alive in this country?
A rock and a hard place is what we call Monday.
I've heard of Rufus Buck.
How bad a man he is.
But he got himself thrown in jail once before,
and I reckon he'll be back there again soon enough.
When he is, maybe I'll come back to this town.
'Cause I ain't paying shit.
You think I made Redwood for myself?
To what end?
Redwood ain't a hiding place, 'cause I don't hide.
It ain't a dream. I don't dream.
You know what it is?
It's an example.
It's an example…
for others to follow.
And you…
you are an enemy of progress.
Please. Please.
-I got a family. -What's your name?
James.
[Rufus] Rest in peace, James.
Now, how much?
How much can be gathered?
Ten thousand.
Maybe 15, if every last cent can be squeezed. [Rufus] Mmm-hmm.
Ain't nobody leave town until we collect it all.
And if you fail to comply,
you and everything you love will burn.
I ain't got nothin' to rob.
But I got somebody to shoot. Step down.
Wiley Escoe. Bass Reeves.
Fuck.
Redwood crawling with gunmen.
Rufus came with 12 and took six of mine.
Who knows how many he got by now.
I don't believe a thing this man sayin'.
He a scout. I say we kill him.
And we take the rest of them teeth.
You ever shot a sheriff, boy? A mayor?
Little harder than shootin' regular folk. And I'm both.
[Bass] You both alive and dead 'cause Rufus don't like loose ends.
Law don't find a man like Rufus Buck unless you got inside information.
Ain't that right, Wiley?
If I had my way, you'd be right up under the jail next to Rufus.
But you cut yourself a deal, wound up wearing a badge instead.
You got your reasons you want Rufus gone, and I got mine.
Ain't the enemy of my enemy my friend?
Rufus tryin' to save Redwood. But for that, he need money.
And that's one thing he ain't have.
All right, look here. You made a deal with the Devil.
Now he come to collect.
You rest up, but be gone before sunup.
Or it's gonna go from bad to badder. You hear?
Marshal. Marshal. Marshal.
All them tricks'll get you killed, son.
[Jim] Listen, Marshal.
I'm faster than any weapon. You can trust in that.
I seen faster.
All right. Where?
In the mirror.
Negro said, "In the mirror."
[Jim] I'm so… I'm sorry.
I rather ride into a gun battle on a dark horse over a golden stallion.
-Fuck that mean? -Shiny shit get shot.
You gonna shoot me?
What you think about that, lawman?
I think y'all gonna die.

I'll be back with information by sunup.
Information from where?
Redwood.
You know we can't trust Wiley's word.
Someone's got to get the lay of the land before we make our next move.
Yeah, Mary, but that somebody ain't got to be you.
Every gunhand in the territory's gonna recognize you the second you hop off your horse.
Same with Bill and Beckwourth.
In case you forgot,
your face more famous than all of ours put together, Stagecoach Mary.
Got it up on advertisements for that saloon of yours from here to Texas.
Which is why I can ride into town in plain sight.
Everybody knows I'm buying saloons. Rufus need money. I'ma make him an offer on Trudy Smith's place--
Rufus need money. I'ma make him an offer on Trudy Smith's place--
Mary, what in my character makes you think I'll allow that?
I'm not asking for your permission.
All right.
Then I… I guess I'll just be asking you for yours.
Since you'll never let a man give you away,
I just have to ask you direct.
That's the ring my father gave my mother.
I was gonna give it to you back in Douglas.
But you didn't.
I am now.
I used to hate feeling helpless over you.
Those days are over now.
Mary…
When the dust settles, we gonna go our separate ways, for good.
But not till the dust settles. I'm here till then.
See you sunup.
Are you a resident of Redwood, ma'am?
You don't own a gun confident enough to ask where I reside.
Well, this gun say answer the damn question.
Well, this gun don't talk.
[Trudy] Stagecoach Mary.
Ghastly Gertrude Smith.
I prefer Treacherous Trudy myself, but I'll take it.
What brings you to my town?
I heard Rufus Buck was back.
-News travels fast. -[man chuckles]
I have an offer he might wanna hear about.
Well, any offer you got,
you can make it to me.
I don't do business with the help.
Give me that shit.
Lead the way, Treacherous Trudy.
Speak your piece.
I assume you know who I am.
I assume you know who I used to run with.
Those days are over for me anyhow,
but I didn't get to be Stagecoach Mary Fields
without having my ears to the ground
and my ears tell me you just lost 25 thou that was coming your way.
[Trudy] I hope your proposal rivals your nerve--
Allow me the latitude of completion.
My saloon in Douglas is boomin'.
Bought me another one in the Elks, and I got a restaurant in Cascade too.
For the sum of all that, I could take this one off your hands.
The mere mention of my name brings forth good business
to any establishment attached, whereas,
with all due respect, but the name Rufus Buck instils fear.
We know who you are.
You walkin' into my town with that proposal is risky.
The kind of risk a woman such as yourself wouldn't tie herself to
unless there was a whole lot more at stake.
See, I don't believe in coincidence,
like you just gonna walk in here right after the Crimson Hoods get ambushed with my money.
right after the Crimson Hoods get ambushed with my money.
What are you thinking?
You must have forgot whose name is on the door.
Another round.
We havin' a party, y'all. Come on.
[Nat] All right, Mary.
All right.
So you still sayin' you don't know nothin' about that money
and you done come here alone?
That's right.
You done rode all the way over here to get yourself killed.
And for what?
For love?
Love is the only thing worth dying for.
But you wouldn't know anything about that.
You know, I had a sister named Mary.
She was pretty, strong-willed, like you.
She died of polio when I was 11.
Always was in pain, but she'd never let me see her cry.
There's this girl called Hope lived by us.
Big fat kid, always picking on the smaller kids.
Obviously out of jealousy.
But she ain't never fuck with me though.
She hated Mary with a passion,
always teasing her about how thin and frail she was.
Then one day, Hope walkin' by our house,
apple in one hand, blade in the other.
She decided to throw the apple across the street at Mary,
and it hit my sister in the head and knocked her out of balance.
She fell down the steps.
Broke her ankle.
And now that…
that was the first and only time I physically seen my sister cry.
And there was Hope standing there laughin' her ugly fuckin' face off.
My daddy…
he got home,
he took off his belt, and he beat me for not protecting my sister.
He lashed me until my whole body went numb.
Then
he went to Hope house to do the same thing to her.
When he got there, he saw her whole family standin' on the side of the house,
all of 'em screamin' and cryin',
and there was Hope…
lyin' on the floor in a pool of blood.
Somebody had slit her throat. Killed her with her own knife.
Daddy was speechless.
He ain't said a word to me when he came home.
The next day, he sent me to live with my grandparents.
And then the next time I seen my sister,
she was laying in a coffin.
Disease had killed her.
I'm sorry your sister had to suffer.
I admire her bravery.
But you get no words from me.
You know, I actually admire your bravery.
But I'm afraid the outcome is still the outcome.
Hope must die.
But not yet.
Leave her out here in the street so everybody can see her.
No one come to collect her 'fore sunup, put a bullet in her head.
[man] Yes, ma'am.
Looks like we don't have to wait that long.
Whoever die first, right?
-Whoever die first. -[Jim] Mmm-hmm.
Get her up.
"Whoever die first"?
Now, what kind of dumbass saying is that?
You two trying to get shot out here?
Nat Love. How predictable.
You predict my friend Bill Pickett aiming at your bowler cap?
You'll be dead before your boys get their aim.
And you die right after.
But your boss won't see one red cent of that money.
My boss?
Where is he?
Where is who?
[Nat] Marshal.
I'm speakin' English, yeah?
-Sound like English to me. -[Nat] Mmm-hmm.
Where's Rufus Buck?
Bass.
[Bass] Trudy.
If I'd known you were switchin' sides, I'da asked you to come join us.
You here for your damsel in distress?
You don't look hard of hearing.
So I'ma ask you again.
Where's Rufus Buck?
Well, clearly, you don't know me.
Tell your men to go, but you stay,
and maybe your damsel will live a little longer.
Marshal.
You're pretty though.
-Ah, take her ass back in there. -Yes, ma'am.
Gonna get me a drink.
[Jim] Hey.
That the quick draw I hear tell about, Cherokee Bill?
I hear you so fast that your opponents ain't got time to draw
before you put two in they back.
No, that ain't me.
I'm the Cherokee Bill that shoots men in the mouth that talk too much.
I'll make it easy for you, then.
You draw first.
That what you think this is? "Who the quickest draw in the West?"
All comes down to who fast and who ain't, right?
No, it all comes down to who's alive and who's dead.
Trudy, I'm gonna get me something to drink.
Good night.
Hey, hey, drink, my ass, man.
-I practiced that standoff all night. -Jim.
-[Jim] You're not about to walk away. -[Nat] Get out of here.
-No, nobody-- -[Nat] Get out of here, Jim.
-[Jim] That chicken-- -[Bass] It ain't the time.
Okay. Okay.
[man] March, boy.
-I said march! -March.
Hup, two, three, four.
That's enough.
They beat you bad?
I'ma kill 'em all.
[Rufus] You familiar with Napoleon?
He said, "I am driven towards an end that I do not know."
"As I reach it, as I shall become unnecessary,
an atom shall suffice to shatter me."
"Until then, all forces of humankind can do nothing to stop me."
That's a man who knew exactly who he was.
Most importantly, he knew that his time would come to an end.
Cut him down.
You know why…
I gave you that scar?
[Nat] So I'd remember you.
[Rufus] No.
No, I gave you that scar so I can know your face when you come back to me.
Nat Love,
the outlaw who robs outlaws,
the angel of death who hunts down those who trespass against him with no mercy.
I know who you are.
And I see the line that you won't cross.
See, I know what's on the other side.
Apologize for the beating.
It was more of an indication for what Ms. Fields might see
if we fail to come to terms.
[Nat] What terms?
You will return the money you stole from me by Friday noon.
Not a moment later.
And you will add $10,000 on top of that. We'll call that interest.
Somethin' funny?
Ooh, shit, how… how you reckon I'ma get that?
You're gonna rob a bank.
Nat Love is gonna rob a bank.
In the meantime, here's a little token of my appreciation in advance.
Go ahead, open it.
I expect my money on Friday.
All of it.
[Bass] You know I can't let you do that.
If that money ain't in Rufus' hands in three days, Mary'll die.
[Pickett] What bank we talking about anyway? [Nat] Maysville.
Maysville?
That's a white town.
Yeah, which is why they gonna have $10,000 in their bank.
It's crazy.
[Jim] My emotions are all types of confused.
I mean, Pickett, I agree. That's crazy.
But, Nat, I also agree with you telling the marshal
that we gonna do that shit anyways.
That's some true outlaw shit.
-We outlaws, ain't we? -[Nat] Ain't no "we," Jim.
Not after that shit you pulled in town nearly got us all killed.
I had that.
[Nat] Fetch that money you took from the Crimson Hoods.
Pickett, kid, you comin' with me.
If Rufus Buck want that bank took, why don't he send his own men?
This way he clean, see?
I gotta go in barefaced as day,
a freshly minted bank robber, face up on wanted posters all over the territory.
They'll be on you like flies on shit before you open the door.
Yep.
I said I had to be recognized.
Go ahead.
[Cuffee] Hell no.
For Mary.
Close shave.
Close fucking shave!
I thought I was falling for a fella for a little bit.
That's why I didn't say nothing.
Well, I ain't the only one. I can't…
I can't… It wasn't just me. It wasn't just me.
It was just you, Jim.
[Cuffee] Giddup now.
-[Nat] Allow me. -[grunts]
What's your real name?
Cuffee my real name.
Name I was born with? Cathay Williams.
You walk worse than you ride, Cathay.
Mr. Love, my momma always told me to respect my elders,
so I'm not gonna say what I'm thinking.
That's all right. I can read your mind.
Then I'm sorry you had to hear that.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, honey.
[teller] Yes?
I'd like to make a withdrawal.
What…
You have to have an account, ma'am.
And, well, I'd recommend a bank in Jericho or maybe Redwood for that.
I'm not talking about that kinda withdrawal.
I'm talk--
I'm talking about…
talking about that kind.
Hey, blue eyes.
You scared.
Your hand is shaking. You'll miss.
I won't.
Exhale.
Attaboy.
I ain't like my partner.
He don't wanna shoot nobody, but all of a sudden, I'm of a mind to.
Now open the fuckin' gate.
Think I'm funny now?
What you lookin' at?
Get all the customers over there.
-Get 'em over there! -Okay, okay.
-Everyone, please, this way quickly. -You too. Move!
Times have changed, ain't they?
They say robbing banks is hard work.
That's a lie. Robbing banks is easy.
The hard part is doing it without killing.
So, what'll it be…
Mr. Manager?
Good man.
[Cuffee] Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Giddyap. Go.
-Pleasure banking with you. -Okay, sir.
Nat Love.
Don't even look like much.
Ain't what it look like. It's what it can buy you.
Rufus won't let Mary go once he gets that money.
Yeah, I know it.
He'll kill her, let me go, so's I carry that hurt with me.
So what, we just went through all that trouble for nothin'?
Now we got something he want.
And that's it?
Gonna have to be.
You can be all hasty and shoot me now if you want,
or you can wait to see what I brought with me first.
[Wiley] Rufus got stashes like this all across these hills.
Enough for a small army.
Don't nobody take what I got coming to me.
Not even the Devil himself.
[Bass] Rufus Buck is a man.
Y'all best reconcile yourselves with that fact.
Man or devil, this gonna be Buck's last day amongst the living.

Afternoon.
I would ask you to run go fetch your superior,
but that'd be like asking you to run go fetch your daddy.
It could be anybody, right?
You know,
I'm willing to bet my right arm
I've got a higher body count than yours.
That'd be a bad bet, son.
I fancy that song or whatever it was you was whistling there.
[Bass] Go, Jerry. Go.
That our money?
Walk with me.
Hey, just… just walk with me.
-Keep an eye on this, Angel. -[Angel] Mmm-hmm.
You know they call your boss the Devil hisself?
Even the Devil needed money, right?
So being as how we are in possession of that money…
let me dictate the terms of engagement.
What the fuck was that? What the fuck was that, old man?
Is that the right arm or the left?
Oh man.
Well, now there's us…
and there's y'all.
You get a hold of your feisty buddy here.
You got a little rowdy rascal.
-Mary. -[Cherokee Bill] Yeah, we'll get to that.
-We gonna count this first. -Now, Cherokee.
Or your boss gonna be one quick draw and $35,000 short.
All right.
Unhitch this horse so's Mary can ride out.
-You always move so slow? -[Cherokee Bill] You always talk so much?
[Nat] Really?
In the back?
What you think, Beckwourth?
Nah, he wouldn't do that
'cause then I would have to put a bullet in his cranium.
And we'll never know who the fastest really is now, will we?
[Cherokee Bill] I gotta hand it to you, boy.
You do know how to make a grand entrance.
Shit, I didn't even rehearse that one.
You know, quick draw, Nat Love is a dead man walking.
But you don't have to be.
Why don't you get on your horse, get your shit,
and go back to whatever it is you call home?
You know that's impossible.
Count down from five?
Five…
Four…
Three…
Why do they always have to count so slow?
Jim!
Blow that bitch, Bill!
Kill her.
Mary!
Push!
Trudy's mine.
Let's go.
[Cherokee Bill] Son of a bitch!
Exhale, motherfucker.
[Bass] Come on.
-Where'd they get you? -Shoulder. Get down!
Matches.
You wanna smoke now?
Matches, Bass.
Okay.
Jump, motherfuckers.
Fuck it.
I always knew it was you
who gave me up.
God knew my heart.
Goodbye, old friend.
Rufus, I didn't have a choice--
I told that kid. Them damn tricks…
-Sorry, ladies. -[footsteps rapidly approaching]
-You all right, Cuffee? -Just need to reload.
You look hurt, Mr. Pickett.
Ain't nothing but a flesh wound. Maggie ain't ready for me today.
What the fuck?
I'll be damned.
[Cuffee] Pickett!
[Cherokee Bill] Now, why you got that look on your face?
No. No, no, no, brother, no, no, no.
Stop that. Don't do that.
You had a choice.
You always got a choice.
[speaking Cherokee] Being scared will only give you bad karma in the afterlife.
He didn't even have a chance, you son of a bitch!
You gonna shoot me in the back too? Or cheat the count?
Beckwourth was faster.
Look after my friend.
[Bass] Nat.
Don't miss.
Pick up your guns.
[Rufus] I know what it is now.
It's the eyes.
Pick 'em up, I said.
[Rufus] Your father,
he was a good man?
He was.
And my mother was a good woman before you cut 'em down.
Seems we had a different upbringing.
I don't care how you was raised.
Now pick up your guns and turn around.
I used to watch my father beat my mother to a pulp
if she overcooked his food.
He cut her up real good if she undercooked it too.
One day, I decided to intervene,
and he turned his wrath on me.
My father was not a good man.
Not a good man. He was an outlaw.
Robbin' banks…
He liked to drink.
My mother took a bottle and cut him to protect me.
He lashed back at her, and just like that, she was gone.
Then, like the coward he is,
he took everything we had and left,
leaving me with my…
my mother.
I was ten years old, you know…
about the same age you was…
when I gave you that scar.
I had to fend for myself, but I became who I am,
just like you.
As I did, all I could ever think about is wanting my father to pay for what he did.
I searched for him for years and years, and I could never find him.
It's like he disappeared off the face of the earth.
I ain't stop though. I kept looking…
until I did find him.
One day…
lo and behold,
there he was, my father,
a new man.
He was clean now.
Sober.
Man of God.
Had a church.
He had a pretty little wife.
And he had a son,
about the age of ten years old,
whose eyes blazed like mine.
You're lyin'.
You're lyin'!
Killing our father was retribution, but--
My father!
My mother!
But it weren't enough.
Letting you live,
that was the true revenge.
Every sin you made, every bank you robbed, everybody you killed.
I mean, look at you.
You everything he tried to run away from.
Buck.
Changed his name to "Love."
You a Buck.
You lyin'.
Just like me.
Just like him.
But you better. You gonna surpass even me because…
I couldn't kill my brother.
Yet here you are about to kill yours.
[sighs] It's time to take your revenge, Nathaniel Buck.
Go on.
-Nathaniel Buck. -No.
Take your revenge.
Nathaniel Buck.
-[gunshot] -Take your goddamn revenge!
You a Buck.
Nathaniel Buck.
-Nathaniel-- -[gunshot]
[Mary, softly] Is the Devil dead?

All right, fellas.
You sure the law gonna believe he's dead?
I'm the law, Ms. Mary.
If I say a man dead, he dead.
And you?
You sure this what you want?
I always kinda wanted to be a deputy, sheriff, marshal person.
What you lookin' at?
We got work to do, Mr. Love.
Let's go.
‎Go!
‎Drive!
‎Come on!
‎Get in!
‎Mehdi!
‎Shit!
‎Fuckers!
‎Mehdi!
‎C'mon!
‎I can't move!
‎I can't move. Leave me!
‎Leave me. Just leave me.
‎Where's Mehdi?
‎He's down.
‎Don't move!
‎Don't move!
‎15 YEARS LATER
‎Fuck me! How's it going, bro?
‎You're looking good.
‎-Good flight? ‎-Yeah.
‎Look at you.
‎Give me that.
‎Sit on that side.
‎Like in England.
‎-It's paradise here. ‎-So I hear.
‎You'll soon get the hang of it.
‎Hurry up, Dad is here.
‎You OK?
‎Sean, Noam, and my wife.
‎Run along.
‎This is ‎tom yam kung‎,
‎a traditional Thai dish.
‎It's a shrimp soup. ‎Careful, it's very spicy.
‎Use a spoon.
‎You speak good French.
‎Thanks. My mother's Swiss ‎and my father's Thai.
‎That explains it.
‎I thought my brother had taught you.
‎He was a lousy student.
‎That's ‎thot man kung‎,‎shrimp cakes.
‎-Do you eat just shrimp? ‎-No.
‎There's everything, even French cheese.
‎I don't need to tell you, ‎this is your home, too.
‎I know.
‎Excuse me.
‎How did you find a hot chick like that?
‎We're French here, not Arabs.
‎They don't think of us as terrorists.
‎Her dad's a big businessman.
‎He's a jerk. We don't talk. ‎He never accepted me.
‎I'm just a ‎falang‎.
‎At least I had money.
‎"Falang"?
‎A Frenchman, a shitty foreigner.
‎But it's good for business.
‎Her half-brother is the head of police.
‎So, my brother's in league ‎with the cops.
‎It's not like that.
‎I didn't choose my in-laws, ‎but I tell you, here...
‎having protection
‎makes life easier. You need their help.
‎Kiss your uncle.
‎Say goodnight.
‎They're cute kids.
‎I didn't know you had any.
‎Well, you told us not to contact you.
‎Are you tired? Your room's all ready.
‎I need some air.
‎-I'll come with you. ‎-No, I'd rather be alone.
‎I'll call Songchai, the driver.
‎My number's in that. ‎Call me if you need me.
‎And cash to have some fun.
‎He'll take you to the bars in Bangla.
‎Go to the Money Night, it's Zak's bar.
‎We need to talk tomorrow.
‎Why didn't you mention your brother?
‎I haven't seen him in 15 years.
‎Are you hiding anything else?
‎No.
‎He did some bad stuff. ‎I didn't want to talk about it.
‎Forget it, it's ancient history, OK?
‎He's always protected me.
‎You always said ‎your childhood was complicated.
‎Yeah, that's putting it mildly.
‎Is there a problem?
‎There's no problem.
‎It's up to you, darling.
‎Yo, Hicham. How's it hangin', dude?
‎Why bring her along?
‎It's OK, she won't disturb us.
‎It disturbs me. I wanted to talk.
‎What's going on?
‎Mehdi's back.
‎Mehdi's out of prison.
‎Mehdi, your brother?
‎Who else? Know any others?
‎Shit, sorry.
‎Is he OK?
‎He looked well.
‎Fifteen years, man.
‎-They flew by. ‎-Maybe not for him.
‎I'm glad for you that he's back.
‎I hope he behaves.
‎Did he mention me?
‎Not you or anyone.
‎The devil is back.
‎Where is he?
‎At Patong.
‎-Cute, isn't she? ‎-What?
‎-The whores ain't enough for you? ‎-What?
‎-Who let you touch her? ‎-Calm down.
‎Am I touching her, fuckin' asshole?
‎My love...
‎Let me see.
‎Goyave, take Winny to ER, he's bleeding.
‎Come on, Winny.
‎Mehdi, no way!
‎I don't believe it!
‎Good to see you, man.
‎I was sitting there, thinking ‎that guy looked just like Mehdi.
‎Meet the guys.
‎You can have Awa.
‎She's gorgeous.
‎She's a sex bomb.
‎I'm not here for the whores.
‎They're princesses, not whores! ‎They're hot chicks.
‎You can't imagine what they can do.
‎I've had 15 years to imagine them.
‎Mamma mia, look at that.
‎Look at that.
‎In Thai, "Mehdi" means "no good"!
‎And your brother Hicham ‎is "smashed pussy".
‎-This is no place for us. ‎-It's for everyone. It's paradise.
‎Fifteen years! ‎It's the happiest day of my life.
‎We gotta celebrate.
‎He's out of it. ‎Most people love it here.
‎Look, he saved my life.
‎-So? ‎-I'm here thanks to him.
‎-He looks like death. ‎-Hey!
‎Don't wake him up.
‎Oh, wow!
‎He looks like Sleeping Beauty ‎after a 15-year siesta!
‎Who'll kiss him first?!
‎Asshole!
‎Do I look stupid?
‎No, the flowers suit you.
‎Look at that.
‎The sea, the chicks, business...
‎Sweet as a peach.
‎I hated it when things were sweet.
‎Never drop your guard.
‎You'll laugh, but I thought ‎it was a gay thing.
‎-I took up golf. ‎-Oh, yeah?
‎It calms me.
‎Having a goal, ‎keeping your concentration...
‎Yet relaxed and laid back.
‎At the end of your move,
‎your solar plexus is in tune.
‎And the aim is to put the ball
‎in the hole. So cool.
‎Yeah, and you do it good!
‎The swing, man!
‎You mustn't mix up the hole
‎with your asshole!
‎Or the hole a bullet will make.
‎Not as much fun.
‎Slim...
‎When do we eat?
‎Not now.
‎Incoming!
‎So good!
‎They're all good. That's the problem!
‎Oh, fuck me!
‎Yeah, you can laugh!
‎I've waited 15 years for that.
‎Where's my share?
‎Give me my share, ‎then I'll go back to France.
‎This is where it's at, not France.
‎Are you deaf?
‎My share!
‎We'll explain. ‎What?
‎We got 2.5 million, ‎the six of us.
‎You kept me 400,000.
‎It's more complicated. How can I put it?
‎There was a big recession. It's all gone.
‎We had to rebuild after the tsunami.
‎What're you talking about?
‎-You look like you're doing OK. ‎-Thank God.
‎Leave God out of it. ‎I did 15 years for you fuckers.
‎We know that.
‎You just screwed whores all that time!
‎-Wait... ‎-What?
‎People die of hunger. ‎It's not my problem.
‎-Shut up. ‎-Screw this!
‎Four hundred grand for a 15-year stretch ‎ain't much.
‎That's 2,222 per month.
‎Couldn't you protect my assets?
‎-Am I a piece of shit? ‎-Calm down.
‎I have no cash. We'll sell stuff.
‎We need some time. Nothing's in my name.
‎It all belongs to my wife: ‎the boat, house, golf course.
‎-What's this crap? ‎-It's true.
‎You can't own a business here.
‎Gotta put it in your chick's name
‎or you work with Thais who rip you off. ‎It ain't easy.
‎I don't give a fuck.
‎You got a golf course!
‎We got shares in one.
‎Not bad for a coke dealer ‎who was our driver!
‎Yeah, yeah.
‎Goyave, pull your head out of your ass. ‎Speak up.
‎Sabai, sabai.
‎What does that mean?
‎Everything's chill.
‎There's a problem, guys.
‎Sabai, sabai! ‎There's a fuckin' big problem!
‎-This sucks. ‎-Are you only waking up now?
‎You all agreed to take his share.
‎Shut up, you!
‎When we lost everything...
‎Shut up!
‎Yeah, I'll shut up.
‎Don't cry.
‎Julia, please, don't cry.
‎Fly to Phuket.
‎I'll pay you back.
‎It'll be OK, don't worry.
‎-Hey, we'll work it out, Mehdi. ‎-You said I'd get the hang of it.
‎-I think I have. ‎-No, you haven't!
‎I didn't marry her father or brother. ‎They're bleeding me dry.
‎-What's their cut? ‎-Seventy percent.
‎-You're joking. ‎-Do I look like I am?
‎-What's his cut? ‎-I don't take a thing.
‎We're partners. Fifty-fifty.
‎Out of the remaining thirty percent, ‎he takes half.
‎Fifteen percent of your business ‎ain't much.
‎And you?
‎I have a restaurant, the Paradise Beach. ‎I sell hamburgers and pizzas
‎I have a restaurant, the Paradise Beach. ‎I sell hamburgers and pizzas ‎to guys like us.
‎I got two clubs. You saw the Money Night.
‎But Goyave has got nothing left.
‎Oh, yeah?
‎I lost the lot. I'm lucky: they help me.
‎-How come? ‎-I'll tell you some time.
‎OK, so, apart from him, ‎you're all businessmen.
‎I gotta join in, too.
‎Mehdi, please...
‎A vacation will do you good. ‎We're all here together.
‎Enjoy yourself. Stop yelling at everyone ‎and being miserable. Please...
‎I'll give you the two bars at Patong.
‎But take the problems, too.
‎What problems?
‎These two-bit punks came ‎five years ago and never left.
‎They're stealing my girls. ‎Seven of 'em so far.
‎-Arabs? ‎-No, blacks.
‎-And you do nothing? ‎-I want a quiet life here.
‎If I touch one of them, ‎they'll trash the place.
‎-What would you do? ‎-What we always fuckin' did.
‎It won't be easy.
‎If you think violence ‎doesn't solve things,
‎you didn't hit hard enough.
‎That's the old you!
‎You can count on me.
‎Are you Moussa?
‎Listen to me.
‎Listen, fucker.
‎I'm taking over the Money Night. ‎Bring back
‎I'm taking over the Money Night. ‎Bring back ‎the girls you took, understand?
‎Next time, you're dead!
‎What do you want to eat?
‎-What you got? ‎-Hamburgers, pizza...
‎Hamburger.
‎-Rare? ‎-Yeah.
‎-‎Pla duk foo‎. ‎-OK.
‎-Two ‎pla duk foo‎. ‎-You got it.
‎Why are you out on your ass?
‎That beach...
‎There were bodies everywhere. A mess.
‎I stayed in Phuket during the tsunami.
‎It took me ten days ‎to find my wife's body.
‎Ten days!
‎Then, I helped the Thais rebuild. ‎I'd lost everything.
‎And the others? ‎They went to Bangkok.
‎You saved her?
‎She's like my daughter.
‎She was two ‎when I pulled her out of the mud.
‎Only her little hand was sticking out.
‎Her folks are dead, so I raise her.
‎I swear, if I had any money, ‎I'd give it to you.
‎I've nothing to lose.
‎Except her.
‎She's pretty.
‎So pretty, I could cry.
‎I want her to study
‎and not end up like some girls ‎who sell their asses to jerks.
‎That's good, bro.
‎Very good.
‎It's OK.
‎-Who was it? ‎-My brother invited us.
‎Oh, no!
‎I don't want to. Go without me.
‎Oh, no, I'm not leaving you. ‎You're coming with me.
‎-Who's going? ‎-Everyone.
‎Who's "everyone"?
‎Everyone.
‎Will anyone remember my name?
‎When I was in the shit, they abandoned me.
‎Even your brother.
‎They had no choice.
‎-Who's he? ‎-Pichai.
‎-Aom's half-brother, police chief. ‎-He takes your money?
‎Quiet.
‎What did he say?
‎Are you here as a tourist ‎or do you want to live here?
‎Stop kissing that dog. It's gross.
‎Are you jealous?
‎Think it's funny?
‎Did I say, laugh?
‎Stop it, hon.
‎Stop what? You're making ‎a spectacle of yourself.
‎-Hands on your head. ‎-What?
‎Hands on your head!
‎-You're joking, Winny. ‎-Do I look like I am?
‎Hands on your head!
‎Right, I'll tell you ‎when you can take them off.
‎Feeding fish to her mutt!
‎Keep 'em up ‎till the dessert. I'll show you.
‎Take 'em down, you dumb bitch.
‎Some haven't changed.
‎To friendship.
‎To my brother.
‎To my friends. Those who didn't forget me.
‎No-one forgot you.
‎To Julia who stayed true.
‎She wrote every day.
‎She warmed my heart.
‎She wiped people's asses in a hospice ‎while you lazed in the sun.
‎All I'll do from now on is for you.
‎I swear.
‎Very moving.
‎What?
‎-They wanna see you. ‎-Oh, yeah?
‎You beat him up?
‎I went to say hi.
‎Listen, next time you behave like that, ‎I'll stab you.
‎What was that?
‎We were dining with my brother-in-law ‎to protect your ass.
‎Cut that crap.
‎It's my business.
‎Do I criticize friends who screw ladyboys?
‎No, I keep my mouth shut.
‎You're the only jerk here ‎with a French whore.
‎I do things differently. Know what I hate?
‎Guys who screw Thai whores.
‎And when your wife disses me, ‎and you keep quiet.
‎Now listen, when my wife is right, ‎I let her speak.
‎You were a pig. I wanted to batter you.
‎Did you? Well, be my guest.
‎Get out of my sight. ‎You've caused enough trouble.
‎I'm the one causing trouble?
‎Since your brother came back, ‎you've been on edge.
‎See you soon.
‎-Good to see you. ‎-Yeah.
‎-I mean it. ‎-Your wife's very pretty.
‎Thank you.
‎I'll come tomorrow.
‎No need, stay with your family.
‎What was Mehdi's guilt trip about?
‎-It's only natural. ‎-Yeah, right.
‎Let's put our cards on the table.
‎We did that holdup. It went to shit. ‎It could've been you, me or Winny.
‎Is it your fault? Or my fault? ‎Look at me. Am I?
‎No. So?
‎-He wants the lot. ‎-His share.
‎It's only natural. He'll get it.
‎How are you gonna do that?
‎We've nothing to sell. What'll you do?
‎-Nothing's in your name. ‎-Just cut the crap.
‎What do you think of my brother?
‎What did you say, honey?
‎What do you think of my brother?
‎He looks lost.
‎I saw hate in your eyes.
‎Don't do anything stupid.
‎-I couldn't stand it. ‎-I know what I'm doing.
‎I can't accept some things. ‎It's a matter of principle.
‎You and your principles!
‎You haven't changed.
‎That's good, isn't it?
‎You've bulked up.
‎Gotta look after yourself.
‎OK, kids.
‎I got something to say.
‎I killed that cop 15 years ago.
‎I did it.
‎Why say that?
‎'Cause it's hard for me.
‎You should've had the life I've had here.
‎You did 15 years to protect us. ‎I dunno what to say to you.
‎-I've fucked up. ‎-Now listen, Hicham...
‎I paid for everyone else, period.
‎Now you all have to pay, OK?
‎I know.
‎Just give me some time.
‎I was so fuckin' happy ‎to see you guys again.
‎But now I gotta think ‎about Julia and myself, see?
‎I feel like my back's against the wall. ‎I don't like that, bro.
‎I know.
‎Find a solution, and fast.
‎Alright, Dango?
‎-OK, guys? ‎-Yeah.
‎Take a seat. Want a drink?
‎Turn the music down.
‎Does it bother you? Good, huh?
‎The new generation.
‎More aggressive. ‎They waste old school guys like you.
‎Not surprising.
‎Hey, we're here to work things out.
‎-You wanted to talk? ‎-Yeah.
‎I know you. People talk.
‎I don't know you.
‎We've all gotten along here ‎for five years.
‎This isn't your place. What do you want? ‎Gimme back the fuckin' girls.
‎Don't talk to us like that, muhfuh!
‎Shut up.
‎I'll waste ya!
‎What're you saying, man?
‎How you gonna aim?
‎Listen, the girls do what they want.
‎If they wanna work here, it's up to them.
‎Who'll stop 'em? You?!
‎Dango, chill. ‎I can get you girls.
‎Think I need your help?
‎You done?
‎The chicks bring in the money.
‎They're sick of working in dives ‎for fat slobs.
‎We treat 'em good.
‎By fuckin' them?
‎I don't tread on people's toes,
‎so don't tread on mine, understand?
‎Stop that.
‎Stop asking if I understand.
‎Think I'm a moron?
‎You threatening me?
‎Guys, be cool. Look where we are.
‎We're in Thailand. It's one big party!
‎I want those girls back tomorrow.
‎-I'll see. ‎-You'll do it.
‎Slim, don't double-deal.
‎-I like you. ‎-I'm just trying to fix things, bro.
‎Yeah, sure.
‎Your brother and his pals ‎are real expats. They've gone soft.
‎Those guys are serious. ‎They've brought their trafficking here.
‎It used to be Morocco and Spain. ‎Now here's where it's at.
‎They don't give a fuck.
‎They'd waste ya for nothing. ‎They got no principles.
‎Yeah, I saw their type in jail.
‎Mehdi, we'll work it out.
‎Come here.
‎Take your dress.
‎You didn't understand.
‎Yeah, I did.
‎We paid her.
‎We came in peace. They're whores.
‎-Fuck off. ‎-Take it easy, old man.
‎She's hot. She can have a good time.
‎She makes me homesick.
‎-So, go home. ‎-What?
‎You gonna make me?
‎Machetes?
‎What're you playin' at?
‎-Hey, whitie! ‎-You asshole!
‎-Hey, whitie! ‎-You asshole! ‎"Asshole"?
‎-Watch out. ‎-I ain't scared.
‎I'm shaking!
‎Fuck off, the lot of you! Scram! ‎Move!
‎Hey, wise ass, we'll take you out.
‎You'll take me out?
‎Will you? Get out, asswipe!
‎Go on, get out of my sight.
‎We gotta move.
‎They won't do anything. We have ‎too much to lose, to start a war.
‎-Sorry. ‎-Where were you?
‎At the Money Night.
‎Screwing girls.
‎Don't talk such crap.
‎I was with European women ‎who get cheated on.
‎That's good.
‎Is it? Right, I'm off.
‎I won't wait for you ‎while you're with chicks.
‎Look, if you want to go whoring, ‎I can understand.
‎You don't understand, dammit.
‎What is this?
‎I'm not some dumb bitch.
‎Leave me here to party ‎with your pals in Phuket.
‎It's perfect for pigs like you!
‎I had problems to take care of.
‎You always do. And you always will.
‎It'll never change.
‎-Julia... ‎-Leave me alone.
‎I feel like it's 15 years ago.
‎What happened?
‎Nothing happened. ‎You won't say?
‎I've nothing to say.
‎Your dad had money.
‎They grew up in poverty, in foster homes.
‎Mehdi and Hicham protected each other.
‎And they always will.
‎No-one can ever separate them.
‎Why bring me here?
‎I'll try to calm down.
‎I need to deal with a few things, ‎then we can visit the islands.
‎What're you waiting for?
‎My money.
‎You think they'll give it to you?
‎If they don't, I'll take it.
‎How?
‎Hello, Vinz. It's Mehdi.
‎I need your help.
‎Contact Pablo and get over here.
‎Thailand, Phuket.
‎Not Pattaya. Phuket, dammit.
‎Not to have fun.
‎You've got it.
‎I'm counting on you.
‎Julia!
‎They shot at kids!
‎That mutt keeps sniffing my ass!
‎-Careful. ‎-I'm sick of that dog.
‎Careful!
‎What?
‎They killed Slim, ‎Tossa and Sombat like dogs.
‎I know. They smashed up my restaurant. ‎It's a fuckin' wreck.
‎Screw your restaurant.
‎Now what?
‎What do we do?
‎-Nothing? ‎-There's a lot of them bastards.
‎-Cut their heads off. ‎-What?
‎-Dango and that other guy. ‎-Bodox. And the big Thai.
‎That's it.
‎-So? ‎-So, what?
‎What're you after?
‎What do you want us to do?
‎You've never done a thing.
‎You lost your balls?
‎-That's not the problem. ‎-I think it is.
‎If you go after them, so will I.
‎It's not up to him.
‎He has a wife and kids.
‎We've led a quiet life for 15 years.
‎We've lost the habit of war.
‎When there's trouble, ‎there's just a few slaps.
‎OK, so when there's a problem, ‎you let them slap you?
‎They're just chicks. ‎Who cares about losing five or six whores?
‎I'm raising hell?
‎Why did you have to cause a shit storm?
‎Shut up, Francky.
‎-Guys... ‎-He's right.
‎We can't let 'em fuck us over. ‎I'm with you.
‎-You don't need to ask. ‎-Yeah, right!
‎Hurry up.
‎Get a move on.
‎Bye, kids.
‎Let's go.
‎Good evening.
‎She's my chick's mom.
‎They won't find us here.
‎He's got us into a fine mess.
‎He's clearing up our mess.
‎He's doing what we couldn't do.
‎Did you hear what I said?
‎We had deals here. Your father-in-law...
‎Fuck my brother-in-law and all his clique!
‎Let me tell you, when all this calms down,
‎they'll come back. Know why? ‎They need us like we need them.
‎-Money's all they're interested in. ‎-Oh, yeah?
‎Your brother's the devil, ‎he'll drag us all down.
‎The thing is, Zak,
‎we shouldn't have got caught.
‎-Why not? ‎-Why were the cops there?
‎It's gotta stop.
‎Take a chill pill.
‎-You're scared of him. ‎-Hey!
‎Look, he's my brother! ‎What can I do, huh? Tell me!
‎Lucky for him he is.
‎Watch your mouth.
‎Someone ratted on us.
‎Stop talking crap.
‎The nights I spent...
‎5,475 nights ‎going over it in my head...
‎We were the last to leave, you behind me.
‎They start shooting.
‎I see you on the ground. ‎I go back for you.
‎Hicham covers us.
‎Who's there, not moving?
‎Who takes off ‎as soon as I put you in the car?
‎Winny? ‎No, he came back with Goyave.
‎Franck?
‎He was driving.
‎Since he was the only dealer,
‎he ratted on us to save his ass.
‎No way! ‎Don't say that.
‎OK, I'll shut up.
‎-He's my friend. ‎-We were all friends.
‎I'm your friend!
‎I'm here to warn and protect you.
‎But take a good look around.
‎We're just waiting like jerks.
‎In two short weeks,
‎he's turned our paradise into hell!
‎-Hello. ‎-It's done.
‎Call your brother-in-law.
‎They can't find us here.
‎Later.
‎-Want something? ‎-No, thanks, I'm not hungry.
‎Yeah, hello.
‎Julia, take the kids upstairs.
‎Go on, kids.
‎Let's read a story.
‎So?
‎What happened?
‎I didn't see it coming.
‎Is that all you can say? Is it?
‎-Where were you? ‎-I was sleeping.
‎You were sleeping?
‎-I'm sorry, bro. ‎-Sorry? Sorry for what?
‎-You did nothing. ‎-What could I do?
‎What could you do?!
‎We're at war, you were asleep! ‎You had my wife and kids!
‎Get off me!
‎I fucked up.
‎You did? Well, fuck you, too!
‎Stop it.
‎How did they find us? ‎I didn't even know the place.
‎So, go on, hit me. Kill me.
‎Go on.
‎I said I was sorry, bro.
‎There are three dead at Kata Beach.
‎There were four of them.
‎So, one fucker is still out there.
‎Don't take any risks.
‎Wait till they call.
‎I'll be there first thing tomorrow ‎with the two million...
‎and with men.
‎Know what Julius Caesar said...
‎about the French?
‎They're the best fighters,
‎but if you amuse them,
‎they're worse than women.
‎Why say that to me?
‎-I frequent them. ‎-Take care...
‎of those who handle our business, ‎be they black or white.
‎Who was with her?
‎I was.
‎And Winny.
‎What?
‎That they'll check everything.
‎And he mentioned Julius Caesar.
‎He ain't happy.
‎Come with us.
‎Notice anything?
‎I couldn't hear anything. They put ‎headphones on me with loud music.
‎-Thai music? ‎-No, French rap.
‎OK. Let's go.
‎Let's forget all this.
‎Vinz!
‎-You good? ‎-Yeah, you?
‎-OK, bro? ‎-Well done.
‎We'll have a cool vacation!
‎You have to go to Bangkok.
‎-What about you? ‎-I need to stay here.
‎-Will you stay long? ‎-While I fix things.
‎You take care.
‎Your brother?
‎What about him?
‎Why didn't he attend the ceremony?
‎I don't know.
‎You see...
‎We're the same.
‎We have no secrets from each other.
‎-Wait. ‎-What?
‎I have a surprise for you.
‎What?
‎Look.
‎Oh, no!
‎Oh, my brother!
‎Oh, Vinz!
‎How are you?
‎This is Pablo.
‎Hi there.
‎Pleased to meet you.
‎I didn't know you were coming.
‎-I wouldn't miss your wedding. ‎-He didn't tell me!
‎-It's the big day. ‎-That's life.
‎Thank you.
‎I'm happy!
‎You won't like this.
‎Try me.
‎You two are going home.
‎It's too dangerous here.
‎Where will I go? ‎We're married. Come with me.
‎My honeymoon gift is "Beat it"?
‎I'll give you money to go.
‎It'll soon calm down. I'll come back.
‎When is "soon"?
‎In one year? Two? ‎When I visit your grave? It'll be calmer!
‎-Look... ‎-What was it for?
‎You know who I am, ‎what I do, what I think?
‎No. You never wanted to know.
‎You imagined it was nicer than it was. ‎So, keep imagining.
‎My life is screwed.
‎Isn't my life screwed?
‎-Stop it. ‎-Stop what?
‎Everything! ‎Why are you armed in a restaurant?
‎I want you to be free from want.
‎Free from want?
‎What do I care if you're not there?
‎Here.
‎What's that?
‎-Was the kidnapping you? ‎-Are you done?
‎Yeah, I'm done.
‎Know what? If that's all you had to say,
‎you needn't have bothered!
‎Get in.
‎Don't come to the airport tomorrow.
‎-If you say so. ‎-I've had enough goodbyes.
‎Please, don't cry.
‎I'm not. It's not sorrow, it's anger.
‎-I did it all for you. ‎-You shouldn't have!
‎Alone with you in a little place,
‎I'd have been happy to lead a normal life.
‎Know what "normal" means?
‎I wish you'd have died in that holdup.
‎I could've started over.
‎Don't fuckin' touch me! Don't!
‎-Stop it! ‎-Come here!
‎Don't touch me!
‎Don't! Fuck off!
‎I don't wanna see you again! Fuck off!
‎What?
‎Did we arrive ten days ago? ‎Are we siblings?
‎On vacation?
‎Which hotel?
‎Take him away.
‎So?
‎-Your brother? ‎-Who asked you? Shut up!
‎I'm your friend.
‎Screw you! Stop thinking for me!
‎Did I ask you to think for me?
‎Listen, we're the next on the list. ‎I won't stand for that.
‎We built everything here.
‎We're losing it all.
‎Did you want for anything before he came?
‎There's no point talking to you.
‎Hey, bro.
‎I wanted us to talk.
‎Why?
‎It's gone to shit. ‎We gotta take some decisions.
‎What decisions?
‎Mehdi...
‎Screw your crap.
‎Oh, yeah?
‎Fuck you.
‎OK, great!
‎Understand? Count me out. Screw your crap.
‎OK, you're doing fine. Stay like that.
‎Let's leave this asshole.
‎Go for a piss, you.
‎What do you think?
‎-Not much. ‎-Oh, yeah?
‎We just take it, lying down?
‎Is Mehdi your new partner?
‎Mehdi's my friend.
‎He's our friend, too.
‎-You're under his thumb. ‎-What? You're in Hicham's pants.
‎Oh, yeah? That's good.
‎Leave me out of it. I hate trouble.
‎We've always been this close! ‎What're we doing here?
‎What about you?
‎I'm looking out for all of us.
‎Sure!
‎-Guys, calm down. ‎-I'm outta here.
‎Yeah, get outta here. ‎But you shouldn't stay neutral.
‎You're my friend.
‎All we've done counts for zilch ‎since Mehdi came.
‎Got a light?
‎Pain in the ass.
‎-You shaking? ‎-What're you talking about?
‎You were shaking when you ratted on us!
‎-What? ‎-What?
‎Yeah. Unless it was Hicham, ‎and you're protecting him.
‎What...
‎I smoked Winny and Zak.
‎I understand about Zak. ‎He was in league with my brother.
‎But tell me something.
‎-Why Winny? ‎-It was Zak...
‎Mehdi got to him.
‎We argued. Winny stuck up for him. ‎I shot 'em.
‎He thought we'd ratted on Mehdi.
‎What?
‎I may be many things, ‎but I'm not a dirty rat.
‎I'm not one of those fuckers.
‎I always protected you.
‎They were gonna shoot me.
‎It's your brother. ‎I told you, but you wouldn't listen.
‎He turned us against each other.
‎All to take over our business.
‎What would you have done?
‎I'll tell you, golfer boy.
‎Do you know the rule of three? ‎One always gets it.
‎You've been too selfish.
‎I told you to stop thinking for me.
‎You asked what was best for me.
‎Well, I'll tell you.
‎Protecting my brother, period.
‎Yeah...
‎Look at me, Mehdi.
‎I didn't rat on you.
‎You believed Zak? You're a fool.
‎You killed two innocent men.
‎No-one ratted on anyone.
‎I was followed by the cops.
‎So, you killed them.
‎Right?
‎Fuckin' stop it.
‎Stop what?
‎While you were sunbathing ‎on your yacht, playing golf, ‎and getting sucked by ladyboys,
‎on your yacht, playing golf, ‎and getting sucked by ladyboys,
‎I was reading books.
‎I read Machiavelli.
‎He said
‎men forget their father's death sooner ‎than the loss of their inheritance.
‎You see... How did you put it? Oh, yeah.
‎"The solar plexus is ‎in tune."
‎Why, Hicham?
‎So, you wanted to kill my brother?
‎Kill my brother?
‎You motherfucker!
‎Son of a fuckin' bitch!
‎Songchai, Goyave!
‎What? This fucker killed Winny and Zak.
‎Get rid of this shit.
‎Aom, I have some bad news.
‎Is it my husband?
‎I'll tell you later.
‎It's done. It's over.
All those in favor…
All opposed.
Well, the PTA has an accepted set of rules concerning the prom.
Young ladies must wear non-revealing dresses.
Young men must wear suits or tuxes.
And if a student chooses to bring a date, they must be of the opposite sex.
Well, can't you just ban this student?
Well, we've been advised that there may be some legal repercussions if we prevent this girl from attending,
so although it breaks my heart, we have no choice.
-There won't be a prom. -[reporter 1] Mrs. Greene, a question. [reporter 2] Have you asked the students what they think of this?
[reporter 1] Are you choosing not to comment? [reporter 2] Hey, there's Emma! Can we get a comment?
[reporter 3] Can you answer some questions? [reporter 1] Can we get a statement?
[reporter 2] Emma, what do you think of the PTA's decision to cancel prom? [reporter 1] Emma, do you have a response?
-[indistinct chatter] -[horns honking]

We're here for the opening night of Eleanor! The Eleanor Roosevelt Musical,
starring the incomparable Dee Dee Allen.
-Dee Dee! You're a Broadway star. -Yes, I am. [chuckles]
You have your choice of roles. What drew you to Eleanor?
Well, Eleanor Roosevelt was a brave, powerful, charismatic woman
who no one had ever heard of.
Her story needs to be told.
People need to know it is possible to change the world,
whether you're a homely middle-aged First Lady
or a Broadway star! [chuckles]
Barry Glickman! You were brilliant as FDR.
From the moment I first stepped into FDR's shoes… And when I say "shoes," I mean wheelchair.
…I had an epiphany.
I realized there is no difference
between the president of the United States and a celebrity.
We both have power. The power to change the world.
It's a weighty responsibility.
Let's talk process.

The first review is in. New Jersey Star-Ledger.
Don't tell me…

The rest of the reviews are coming in!
New York Post, Associated Press, New York Times.
-[all gasp] -The New York Times!
Wow…
[Dee Dee] What?
-[Sheldon] Wow… -What's happening?
This is not a review you want when you have crappy advance sales.
This is gonna close us.
What didn't they like? Was it the hip-hop?
Yes, but not only that.
-For God's sake, Sheldon. Just read it. -What? Read.
[Sheldon] Okay, just the highlights.
"Barry Glickman's FDR might just be the most insultingly misguided,
offensive, and laughable performance
that this reviewer has ever had the squirming misfortune to endure."
That's not so bad.
-Do her. Do her. -I'm just saying.
Oh? Mmm. "Watching Dee Dee Allen's Eleanor Roosevelt
croaking out a heavy-handed message of activism
is like paying an aging drag queen
to shove a syrup-soaked American flag down my throat."
Well, that… That's not criticism.
That's just… It's just a per… [voice breaking] …a personal attack.
"If you're considering buying a ticket to this show, do yourself a favor."
"Buy a few feet of good, heavy rope instead
and then go hang yourself."
[Barry] Oh, God! Oh, God!
[mutters] What? Was the show really that bad?
It's not the show. It's you two.
You're just not likeable.
-What? -What?
Nobody likes a narcissist.
-Oh, this… [clears throat] -Oh, that.
Leave it to me. I'll go and try and change the narrative once again.
-I hate this world! This is bullshit! -Just horrible. It's just… It hurts.
It… It hurts my heart.
-[Barry exhales] -Where did everybody go?
-What can I get you? -[both] Yola Mezcal blackberry smash.
[bartender] My condolences, Dee Dee.
But remember, you have friends.
Thank you. Who are you?
Trent Oliver.
-We've done five shows together. -Oh, really? Oh, my God.
Trent went to Juilliard. Won't shut up about it.
-Oh, right, Trent! Of course, Trent! -Trent.
Why are you dressed like a waiter?
-I'm in between gigs at the moment. -[Dee Dee] Hmm.
Honestly, Dee Dee, I feel adrift as I did in my days before Juilliard.
Oh, my God.
You see, my passions are fueled by the power of Lady Theater
and how she can, with a gentle touch of her hand,
sculpt a human soul.
-But we learned at Juilliard… -Oh, mother of God.
If I could soliloquize, "If you prick me, do I not bleed?"
"And if you do not pay me, do I not still act?"
That might be enough.
Still, I have played Hamlet,
and yet I'm only known as that guy from the beloved early aughts' sitcom…
[Trent] Talk to the Hand.
I question the very meaning of my existence.
Maggie Smith once approached me in a men's bathroom and she said,
"Who sent you? Was it Michelle Dockery?"
"Because the court said 500 yards." You could tell she was scared.
-Hey, guys! -[Barry] Angie! Angie.
I'm sorry your show closed on opening night again!
Welcome to the world of the unemployed. Top me off.
I thought you were in Chicago.
[groans] I just quit.
Twenty years in the chorus and they still wouldn't let me play Roxie Hart.
-[Dee Dee] Aw. -You wanna know who's playing the role?
-Kelly Ripa? -Cher?
-Connie Chung. -Kris Jenner?
No, Tina Louise.
Ginger from Gilligan's Island.
Oh, my God, is she still alive?
We're wasting our lives.
Hmm, it's true. At least we're all in the same boat.
"Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows."
-[Barry] Oh, my God. -That's from The Tempest.
Okay, one, shut up. Two, I refuse to give up, okay?
We're… We're still celebrities. We still have power.
Now, The Times sort of castrated you as it were.
Yep. They wrote you off as aging narcissists.
I still don't understand what's wrong with that.
There's a very simple way that we can still love ourselves
yet appear to be decent human beings, okay?
We will become celebrity activists.
-[Angie] Oh! Brilliant! -[Barry] Right?
-All we need is a cause. -A cause célèbre.
Everybody think of some causes. Go.
-Um, poverty? -Too big.
World hunger.
That is also a major thing. No, we need something we can handle.
Some little injustice we can drive to. Recycling.
-Let's see what's trending. -[Barry] Recycling's good.
-Why are there so many award shows? -Parking.
-[Barry] Or the TVs in the back of cabs. -Oh! Oh, yeah, what about this girl?
Oh, my gosh. Check this out.
-[Barry] What girl? -It's all over Twitter. [Barry] Oh.
She's from Edgewater, Indiana.
She's a lesbian. She wanted to take her girlfriend to the high school prom,
and the PTA went apeshit and they canceled it.
They canceled prom?
-Are they allowed to do that? -No.
[reporter] Principal Hawkins, your response.
The first thing I'm going to do is contact the Indiana state's attorney.
This is not about school rules. This is a civil rights case.
Wait, seriously?
I'm betting pressure from the state's attorney will stop these bigots cold.
It better. Because I'll tell you this much.
If word gets out, people are gonna get mad.
This pisses me off.
The next thing you know, some modern-day Eleanor Roosevelt
is gonna march down here and all hell's gonna break loose.
We have got to go down there and raise holy hell.
We will be the biggest thing to happen in Indiana
since… whatever's happened in Indiana.
-So this is it? This is our cause? -Yes. Are you with me?
-We'll have a rally! -Yes!
-We'll have picket signs! -We'll make T-shirts.
We'll get Sheldon to tag along. He can find us a venue.
-Can we actually do this? -You bet your sweet MILF ass we can!
We are gonna prove…

-It's our way of saying thank you, Emma. -Yeah. Thanks for canceling prom.
I didn't cancel prom. Your parents did.
Come on. Lay off her.
-Oh, are you on her side now? -[scoffs] No.

So, what are you saying?
I'm just saying I'm really excited to be a part of something like this.
We'll see how the PTA meeting goes.
Well, it's not gonna be fun. We'll get through it.

-[scoffs] Oh, my God. -What?
Oh, come on, you know how political the Tonys are.
They don't vote for you. They vote for your brand.
My brand is a little tarnished at the moment.
'Cause of the infamous tirade at the Longacre Theatre?
When a cell phone goes off in the middle of a performance…
-I can't be held responsible. -It was your cell phone!
-I didn't know that! -It was in your wig!
I didn't know that at the time. Anyway…
All the goodwill that we're gonna get from this thing will wash me clean,

You're just greedy. I'd be happy with one Tony.
-I thought I had a shot with FDR. -Mmm-hmm.
I need a win.
I'm so sick of all the rejection. I'm no Dee Dee Allen.
-A lot of bile. -Well, I'm angry at life.
No, I mean Trent. He's retching again.
You were saying something about your…
I got into this business, yes, because I loved it,
but also to prove to everyone who doubted me,
my… teachers, the kids on the school bus, my horrible parents,
that I could do something. Something important.
[exhales] That's exactly what we are doing.
Something important.
I just hope we don't screw it up.

I'm sorry, you're telling us that the state's attorney
is forcing us to have a prom?
No, the state's attorney wants us to hold an inclusive prom. -Yes. -[audience murmurs]
-Yes. -[audience murmurs] Because that's what they feel best reflects America's values.
Well, this isn't America. This is Indiana.
All right.
Just to be clear, this is America
and everyone gets to have an opinion-- Oh, just like you.
My son will not be forced to go to a homosexual prom.
Thank you, Beverly! Thank you!
Again, it is not a homosexual prom. It is an inclusive prom…
-With homosexuals. -You don't have to attend--
You don't have to attend if you don't want to.
Look… I… I'm sorry you're upset,
but the organization of the prom is within the purview of the student council.
Let's hear what they have to say. Alyssa?
-Uh… Okay. -[scattered applause]
Well, we want prom to go on, obviously.
It's supposed to be a celebration of all students--
Okay. No, thank you. It's fine, everyone.
Sweetheart, I'm so sorry, but this is not a student matter.
This is about government… tearing our community apart.
It's about big government taking away our freedom of choice.
[Principal Hawkins] Okay. Okay.
This is not about government intervention.
Emma, what is this about?
I just want to go to prom like any other kid. [Principal Hawkins] Mmm-hmm. But you can't.
[Principal Hawkins] Mmm-hmm. But you can't.
She can't, and that's why the courts are involved.
Ask yourself.
What exactly is it that you find so frightening about gay people?
-[door crashes opens] -[Barry] Hold it! Stop! Stop!
Hold it!
-[indistinct chatter] -What you are doing here is wrong.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Where is our girl? Where's Emma? Emma!
I'm Emma.
Emma, my name is Barry, and I'm here to tell you that you are not alone.
Okay? I am as gay as a bucket of wigs.
-[audience clamoring] -[loudly] A bucket of them!
And we are here from New York City and we are gonna save you.
Tomorrow, we will hold a rally.
-There'll be banners and choreography. -Excuse me.

What kind of school are you running here, Mr. Hawkins?
Excuse me, Miss Allen. I'm Tom. Tom Hawkins.
I am the principal and I just, um… What are you doing?
We have come to show this community
that gay people and gay-positive icons, such as myself,
[inhales] are made of the same flesh and blood as they are. Uh-huh.
If they don't have gay people here, why is my Scruff going crazy right now?
We're not monsters.
We're cultural disruptors. [chuckles]
I'm a fan.
-Really? -Yeah. Yes, I am. [giggles]
[chuckles] What kind of a fan? Big fan? Small fan? Scary stabby fan?
You could say that I'm a big fan. Yes.
Really? That's so surprising because you're not my usual demographic.
-You mean Black? -No, straight.
You are straight, right?
Yes. I am. Straight people like Broadway too.
[chuckles] I've heard that. Always thought it was a fairy tale.
-[chuckles] So to speak. -[chuckles] So to speak. Well, it's true.
Um, I've been a fan since I saw you in the show for which you won your first Tony.
-No! You saw Swallow the Moon? -I did.
The number at the top of the second act, "The Lady's Improving"? Chills.
[chuckles] That song made me a star.
It made me a fan.
-Uh, Dee Dee, we gotta make haste. -Okay.
Uh, Miss Allen, I just… This is a very delicate situation.
I'm asking you and your friends to back off for a few days.
-Back off? -Yeah.
Backing off is exactly what we're not going to do.
I see what's happening here. You're trying to disarm me with flattery.
It's not going to work, Tom. Flattery makes me stronger.
Fuels my ego.
-[Alyssa] That was insane. -I know.
-I'm really freaking out. -Don't freak out.
We have a plan, remember?
We're gonna get dressed up and go to prom
and be together in public, not hide anymore.

Oh. Dickinson, four rooms. I called yesterday.
Four rooms of varying size
to reflect the hierarchy of the company, right? [chuckles]
Where is my suite?
We don't have a suite.
-Now do you have a suite? -Oh!
No, we don't have any suites. All the rooms are the same.
Surely you know who I am.
At the very least, I would like a room next to the spa.
Uh, there's no spa.
Angie, what is this place? We're all gonna get stabbed and stuffed.
-You know that, right? -Orbitz gave it three stars!
Do you have any cabins?
No, we don't have any cabins.
-How about now? -[laughing] What is that?
It's a Drama Desk. You know what it is.
-[whispering] I vomited in the bus again. -[Angie] Mmm.
Can I see the hotel doctor, please?
Oh, my God, it's you.
I can't believe it. It's actually you.
You're the guy from Talk to the Hand. It's on every night at 9:00 after--
-Can I have my room, please? -Okay, let's get started. All right?

Okay, Sheldon's working on a venue. Now, how's the song?
Uh, about that. I was misled by my representation.
Mr. Sondheim is not a fan of my Sweeney Todd.
-Quite the opposite, actually. -[Barry] Oh, my God…
Jesus, Trent, you screwed us.
Don't worry. I wrote something myself. Yeah.
It's quite rousing,
and in a very humane key.
The Godspell kids will back us up,
and they have their own costumes. You're welcome.
-Oh, my God. [giggles] -Yeah!
-This is awful. -[giggles] We can't perform this. They'll boo us off the stage.
No, all we need is a simple message that tugs at the heartstrings
No, all we need is a simple message that tugs at the heartstrings and a little pageantry.

-What? -That's amazing!

-Trent, I could rip your face off. -I'm sorry.
[Barry] You made me fail. I am so sick of failing. What do we do now?
We leave.
-First we kill Trent, then we leave. -What about the girl?
-[Dee Dee sighs] -[Principal Hawkins] Hello, everyone…
We have some news. Emma and I wanted to be the ones to tell you,
thanks to pressure from the state's attorney's office, prom is back on!
-[Barry] What? -Prom is back on! [squeals]
-[all cheering] -We did it!
See? We're not narcissists.
Just to be clear, uh, it's not because of you…
Well, maybe it was.
I mean, everybody started freaking out when you got here.
The lawyer might've had legal power, but you really scared people.
-[Angie] Aw! -We scared people!
Important thing is, it's a victory. Now you get to go to prom like everybody else!
-[Angie] Yes! -What are you gonna wear?
I was thinking like a vintage tux and some high tops.
I don't know. Does it matter?
-Does it… -[scoffs]
-Honey… -Sweetheart, boo-boo.
I don't know you, okay? And you don't know me,
but I am begging you, let me dress you for the prom.
-Okay? Yeah? -Okay.
We're going to Saks.
-Uh, there's no Saks here. -We have a Kmart!
-A what? -A Kmart.
-[laughs] -[Barry] Fine.
We'll check out the Reba McEntire collection at Kmart, do a little fashion show.
Okay! Oh, can we do it tomorrow? We can meet at my place.
I have to go and find out if I still have a date.
Sure. I'll go ahead, do a pre-shop.
Okay? Will you give me a ride in your pickup truck?
Are you saying that because I'm a lesbian, I drive a pickup?
-Well, do you? [chuckles] -Shut up.
-[Sheldon] Anybody hungry? -[Angie] I could drink.
-[Sheldon] What's around here? -I saw a Big Boy by the highway.
-[Sheldon] Ooh, they have a gay bar here? -[Angie] I love Big Boy.
Oh, gay bar. Can't go. I'd be mobbed.
-Oh! Of course. -[both chuckle]
-So, it's nice to see Emma smile again. -Yes.
She's had a rough go of it.
I gathered that. Yeah.
-Even before the prom controversy. -Oh?
When she came out, her parents, well, they threw her out of the house.
-Really? -Yeah. Yeah. She was 16.
-It was, uh, pretty ugly. -Oh…
Anyway, um…
thank you for helping her…
-Or trying to. -[both chuckle softly]
[Dee Dee] Yeah…
-Uh, Tom? -Yes, yeah?
Is there a restaurant in town that has plates and cutlery and…
Oh, uh, there's an Applebee's by the mall.
-Would you like to go? -Yes.
Take me now to this Apples & Bees place.

[Alyssa] You did it. No, you actually did it.
We have a prom because of you.
It's like a love bomb went off. I've seen six promposals today.
People are gonna see us dancing together and kissing.
It's gonna be impossible not to kiss you.
Oh, my God, and you know, what's my mom going to think?
I mean, she'll be in public, so she can't totally freak out.
It doesn't matter what she does. This is about us.
This is about us finally being us.

I save all of my money. I go to New York every summer.
-I see as many Broadway shows as I can. -Oh.
When I run out of money, I second act them.
-Oh. -Don't tell anybody. -Bad! -[both chuckle]
My point is, I've seen you many, many times.
Mr. Hawkins.
Mrs. Greene.
Hello. I'm Dee Dee Allen.
-We haven't officially met. -No.
-Hello. Dee Dee Allen. -We're aware.
Ms. Allen, I'm sure that you are very well-versed in the ways of the world
and Broadway in particular. That's a community.
But you don't know us. You don't know this town and our values.
No, well, I'm just here advocating on behalf of a young girl
whose voice perhaps is not heard by some in the community.
Yes. Well, perhaps you should stick to acting instead of activism.
Enjoy your meal.
We didn't mean to make anything worse here.
I appreciate everything that you're doing.
Well, let's just drop it.
Yeah.
Tell me… [chuckles softly]
I've never said this before to anyone.
Tell me about you.
-About me? -Yeah.
I don't know. I'm just a small-town principal.
Uh, you know, it can be frustrating, but, uh, at least I have a job.
Yeah, lucky you.
Single.
Sorry?
I'm single. Just putting that out there.
Really? [giggles]
I'm surprised.
Oh, well, I'm surprised you're surprised. [chuckles] The two things I'm most passionate about in the world
[chuckles] The two things I'm most passionate about in the world
are Broadway musicals and secondary school administration.
I typed that into a dating website once, and a little message popped up that said,
"You will have zero matches forever."
But you're so smart and you're really good-looking.
-[clears throat] -Well, if I…
[clears throat] Thank you.
It's just, I look at people like you,
and I just think how lucky you are to be surrounded by your people.
My wh-- My people? [chuckles]
I wasn't born on Broadway. You know?
I'm from Zelienople, Pennsylvania.
Yeah, I grew up dirt poor.
This whole… [rolls tongue]
All this, I invented it.
Yeah. I'm just a small-town girl and…
-I had a big dream. -Hmm.
Single, just putting it out there.
Well, I'm divorced.
Oh, I think I read about that. Eddie Sharpe, the talk show host?
Yeah, right.
It lasted 15 heart-pulverizing years.
I imagine it must be hard being Dee Dee Allen, being a Broadway star.
You know, it is hard.
Sometimes I think I really… I just want to quit.
No. No, please, you can't-- You can't do that.
[laughing] Why not?
Because I need you to do what you do.

-That's a nice picture. -Oh, it's terrible.
Look at the backdrop. Clouds? What, are we flying?
It's sweet.
Well…
you know, she needed proof she was still part of the family,
and nothing says family like a Sears family portrait.
-Is there booze in this? -There sure is.
-[coughs] When you said lemonade… -Well, it's Indiana lemonade.
Okay, it's official. I love you. You're the cool grandmother I never had.
Hey, let me ask you something. What happened with Emma?
You're not a mother, so you can't know what it's like
You're not a mother, so you can't know what it's like to see your own daughter give up her child.
I'm sorry.
When Emma came out, oh, they could not handle it.
To bad parents and their broken progeny.
Although Emma is fine. She's a strong kid. [Barry] Mmm.
Oh, I wasn't talking about her.
What? You got kicked out too?
Well, I left before they could do that.
[Emma] So the only nice dress I have is this. Wow.
Okay, I mean, yeah, yep, you could wear that to prom
or keep it lying around in case there's a remake of Little House on the Prairie.
Okay. That's it. I like him.
Emma, please let me dress you for this prom.
I don't know. This is all so crazy. What did you wear to your prom?
Well, I was going to wear a silver tux,
aqua accessories, the whole look.
I waited outside, anxious to see my crush,
but when I saw him with his date, I froze.
I couldn't go in.
I didn't have your courage.
This isn't about me.
This is about you.
And I promise you are going to have the night of your life.
What is your date wearing?
I don't know.
I've never been to her house before.
Her mom doesn't know about us.
How long have you been together?
-A year and a half. -Oh, honey.
But she's coming out tonight, big time. That's the plan.
I'm really scared.
Would you get over here?
The point is you are brave.
You made all this happen.
When you walk into that gym tonight, you know what people are gonna see?
They're going to see the bravest person on the planet.
This is so hard. Does every girl go through this?
Yes, all across town,
girls are spraying on their tans and whitening their teeth,
trying to look their best for the prom, but they're wasting their time
because they don't have the glow that you have right now.
I trust you completely, and that's kind of scary too.
Can we please go shop? Can we mall it?
-Is that okay? -Yes, mall the hell out of it!
-Let's go. -Okay!
But get changed. This is disgusting.

[Barry] Wait there. I'll get the door. Okay? Okay.
-Are you ready? -We're ready. We can't wait.
-Here, hold this. I wanna get the picture. -Okay. here we go.
-[Sheldon] Wow. -[Dee Dee] Oh, my God!
-[Sheldon] Wow. -[Dee Dee] Oh, my God! -[gasps] Look at you! -[Dee Dee squeals]
You look amazing!
[Emma] Are you sure it's not too girly?
Aw. No, it's just the right amount of girly.
-You did well. -Right?
Hey, where's your date?
We're meeting in the gym. She's still a little shy about all this.
Well, this is where we leave you.
-[Angie laughs] -Our work here is done.
You go. You have the time of your life.
Can you walk me in? I'm a little nervous.
Of course. Hey, hold on tight.
-Ready? -Yep.
-Clutch in this hand. -Oh, sorry!
Come on.
-[Trent] Who wants punch? -[Angie] Only if it's spiked.
The walk away. The cute little truck.
-[Emma] We're doin' it! -[Barry] Go ahead.
[Emma] What's going on? I'm putting the pieces together. Gimme a sec.
-[Barry] What is happening? -[Emma] Where is everybody?
Something is really wrong. The whole parking lot is completely empty.
[Sheldon] God. What's the theme of this prom? Death row?
Mr. Hawkins, where are all the kids? I don't understand.
Mom, what's happening? Why aren't we at the gym?
At the last minute, there was a problem, so we had to change venues.
No, Mom, what's going on?
The courts told the PTA they had to hold an inclusive prom.
Don't worry. It's fine. We did what we were required to do.
There was some resistance.
So the parents met without my knowledge, and they've organized two proms.
One for the kids at the Elks Lodge in town.
And this one just for you.
-We gave her a prom. -You did what?
Wait, no, no.
I got texts from kids at school. Everybody said it was here.
And they were lying to you. It was part of the plan.
-You lied to me. -Oh, yeah? Who's the liar?
We know about you and Emma, and trust me, we're doing you a favor.
No.
-Oh, my God. This is so cruel. -I'm gonna cry.
Okay, honey. Look at me.
-Angie. -Yeah.
-I want to go home. -I know you do.
-This isn't happening. -And you got us, and this is awful.
-No, no. -Honey.

-Alyssa? -I swear I had no idea.
How could you not know? You were on the prom committee.
It was Shelby and Kaylee.
They figured out we were together and they made sure I didn't find out.
-They didn't want me to tell you. -Then come meet me.
I can't.
Look, my mother's here.
[crying] Well, leave her. Tell her you're gay!
Tell her we're in love. That was the plan, wasn't it?
[shakily] I'm really sorry.
Have fun at the normal person's prom.
-Wait. Emma. -[call ends]
Emma!
Okay. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to that prom, okay?
They can't stop us. We will march into that room--
No! No, enough.
This is already the worst night of my life.
Please, just stop helping me.
Emma! Emma!
This is a complete disaster.
[Sheldon] This is a PR problem.
No, Sheldon. We had a PR problem back in New York.
This was supposed to solve that.
But this…
This is heartbreaking.
This is why you came here? For publicity?
[Mrs. Greene] I have been asked to read a statement.
"What happened here was not the result of some elaborate plan
to humiliate this girl, as has been reported in the press."
"The James Madison High School Parent-Teacher Association
felt Emma would not be safe
if we allowed her to attend prom with the other students
because the uncomfortable truth
is there are people in our community who are offended by her life choices."
I can't even wrap my head around this. It's a nightmare. Oh, my God!
I wanna be the cockeyed optimist here 'cause I played Nellie Forbush in South Pacific.
It was a dinner theater production, but…
This is horrible. It really is.
Thanks for hanging out with me these past couple of days.
You've been a good friend.
-I have? -You have. You seem surprised.
No, I just…
I'm a chorus girl. You know, I just…
No one ever thanks me. They don't even see me.
Spend my whole life trying to stay in the game,
and keep my day-drinking under control.
That's really nice. Thanks, kid.
Hey, you're going to get through this. I know it.
I thought that when my parents rejected me and stopped loving me
that I would never feel any worse, you know?
And now this…
And I feel worse.
-Honey… -I've never felt so alone in my life.
But you're not alone. You're not.
You got me. Hmm?
And we are ride-or-die, and you do have friends.
Where are they?
-[Dee Dee] This is it. -[Trent] Yes.
-No. -Well, okay.
-Emma, can we come in? -Yes.
-We brought Häagen-Dazs. -[Trent] That's fancy ice cream.
I know what Häagen-Dazs is. Hand it over.
Emma, I know you said you didn't want us to help anymore,
but we cannot let them get away with this. We have got to fight back.
Okay, I know everybody's really angry.
But I think we have to admit that we have made things worse.
I think the best thing we can do is disinfect our things and go back home.
-No, we are not leaving. -No!
Dee Dee, we are gonna stay here, and we're going to turn this thing around.
-We gotta take back the press. -[Trent] Yes, how?
Emma, you've got to step up and be the face of this thing.
And that's going to get her a prom?
This is not about a prom anymore. This is about right and wrong.
We need a national audience, prime time.
You want a big audience fast? We gotta use our ace in the hole.
-One call to Eddie Sharpe is all we need. -No. No.
-[Trent] Dee Dee! -He's right.
If I ask him for something, he will want something in return,
and what he will want is the Hamptons house. He's been trying to get it for years.
Okay. Okay, fine. Look, Sheldon, you got to get that girl on TV.
-Okay. -Great.
No, not great.
I'm sorry, but there is no way I'm getting in front of a camera
and telling my story to millions of people. I can't do that.
-See? -Please. Please, just go.
-Emma, if you do nothing-- Okay. -Barry. Go.
-Okay, I get it. Okay. Okay. -[Angie] Go. Go, go, go. Go, go.
[whispering] I got this. I know what I'm doing.
Let me do my thing.
There must be a way to rid this community, and by extension, the nation, of this cancer of intolerance.
What are you even doing here? What happened to Godspell?
Indianapolis was canceled, as was the naval base at Guantánamo Bay.
What I'm thinking I'm going to do is this. Venture forth and seek out the young people and rap, in a non-musical sense.
Let's go get some more, huh?
Two spoons this time.
Come on.
Before you lecture me or kick me to death with those crazy antelope legs of yours,
or whatever you're gonna do, I know I should do something.
I just can't.
You gotta do this.
You gotta do it for all of us people
that are standing in the wings, waiting to go on.
-I'm too scared. -Hmm.
Let me tell you a story.
It's 1975
and the original company of Chicago is in previews,
and the worst flu in history hits the cast.
They're down to the third cover for the role of Roxie Hart
and she's scared, just like you are.
And Fosse, who is a real ballbuster, is putting her through her paces
and she's petrified.
Worst of all, she's doing the routine like she's a robot.
So the Foss, he says, "Hey, kid. Snap out of it."
"You got the steps."
"You've got the notes."
"Where's the zazz, baby?"
And even though she'd never heard that word before,
she knew immediately what it meant.
And she went out there and she found that spotlight,
and she crushed that performance so hard,
she had that whole audience standing on their feet screaming bloody murder!
And that girl was you!
What?
How old do you think I am?
It was 1975! No.
The point is every Fosse girl knows that story.
It's all about finding your light.

Saw this movie with Eddie.
-It was our first date. -[Barry] Was it really?
-Yeah. -[Barry] Mmm.
Then he… took me out for dinner after.
Well, I took him out. [chuckles]
He didn't have any money.
He was just starting out in comedy, and he didn't have the big show like now.
Fifteen years, he didn't have any money.
And I picked up the tab. I paid.
-[Barry] That was a bad move. -[Dee Dee] No kidding. I'm still paying.
Can I make an observation?
[sighs] Is it a pleasant observation or is it an irritating one?
You're not over him.
No, don't say that. I am not…
Trust me. I am… [chuckling] I am way over him.
I'm just mad at myself, you know, I am so…
Why it took me so long to…
figure it out.
You know? I believed him. I believed him every single time.
"I promise you, it's nothing."
"It's meaningless. She's nothing to me. It's over."
I finally got the message, you know. He didn't love me. [chuckles]
He didn't…
[chuckling] He didn't even like me.
But he liked the money.
Oh, yeah, so I got out.
I got out…
and I gave him half my money.
And now here we are, singing to trucks.
-And he's got a hit TV show. -[audience cheering]
And I still owe him half my unemployment check.
[announcer on TV] It's Eddie Sharpe!
Welcome, everybody! What's today's words of wisdom?
[Eddie and audience] Never sign a prenup!
And you know what the worst part is?
I shut down.
He took my little, delicate blueberry heart,
and he just… squished it.
-What? -Here's what you're gonna do, okay?
You're gonna wear something heart-stopping, like that yellow cape
and those cute little boots.
And you are gonna march down
to that principal's office like a bad, bad girl.
[chuckling] Tom? -Tom is a fan. Friend. -[Barry] Hmm?
Well…
he likes you.
As a fan. Friend.
I don't know. Not even that much anymore.
Okay, let's cut the crap. I would kill, kill,
to have a guy look at me the way that he looks at you.
Stop it.
You're just… You're poking my heart with your finger.
Your still-beating, delicate little blueberry heart?
Do you think he really, really likes me?
Oh, my God, yes!
Barry! [kisses]
-I love you! I love you! -I love you! I love you!
You're just such a great… everything.
[Dee Dee] Okay, no, no, no. Okay.
This, the master stroke, your idea.
-And the boots? -And the little cute boots.
This is it.
That is good.
Mmm, now…
you.
I've been thinking about you since we got here.
Oh, God. I knew this was gonna somehow turn around to me.
And I think it's time somebody poked that gay little heart of yours.
Are we doing this? Fine. Uh…
Do I only go for 10s when I know I'm a 6.2? Yes and--
Your parents. You're from Ohio, right?
So?
We're in Indiana.
-Ohio, Indiana, they're close. -I can see where you're driving this.
You have two living parents
that you'll never be nearer to than you are right now.
-I think you should call them. -No.
They threw me away.
Well, did they really?
I told them that I was gay,
and they said that they would take me to therapy to change myself completely.
Let your parents see who you are before it's too late.
If you don't…
you'll regret it.
I'm not the one who should have regrets.
[voice breaking] I was the kid.
I was the kid!
[crying] I was 16.
Sixteen years old. I was terrified.
Terrified!
And I needed one thing from them and they couldn't give it to me. So don't you…

Hi.

[Principal Hawkins] Well, they each had a bite.
-Ooh, what'd you do? -[Principal Hawkins] Yeah, a big bite.
I appreciate it. Bye-bye.
Am I interrupting something?
I was just doing some research,
trying to figure out if urinal cakes are poisonous.
-Uh, how can I help you? -[chuckles softly]
Well, I've just been wandering around town all day.
I've seen the… sight. [chuckles softly]
And, um…
Bottom line is I just thought you might want to take me to dinner
and worship me again. [chuckles]
No, I would not like to do that.
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do.
Okay, what's going on here? Why is everybody always so mad at me?
Well, speaking for myself, it's because you're an opportunist.
You came here for publicity. You're a terrible person.
No, no. Nobody gets to talk to me that way. Nobody!
You know, meeting you in person has been colossally disappointing.
I wanted you to be Dolores.
Who the hell is Dolores?
From Swallow the Moon.
[Principal Hawkins] She was joyful. She was full of courage and hope.
-Okay, but she was fictional. -But you made her real.
When you sang "The Lady's Improving" to Troy Gibson,
you were admitting you weren't perfect and you knew you could be better,
and that's why he didn't fire you from the circus act.
Such humility and dignity.
-That's who I thought you were. -Well, I'm not.
I'm not Dolores.
I'm just a really, really, really good actress. And you…
You're just some hick town high school teacher
who can't even tell the difference between fantasy and reality.
-Are we done? -Oh, yeah, we're done.

I'm not a total lost cause. That was a totally selfless act.
I mean, people would pay premium prices for that performance.
[sighs] All right, you guys are dismissed.
Dee Dee, not charging for an apology is not a selfless act.
What the hell?
If you want people to like you instead of hate you, you have to be good.
A good person. You have to put other people's interests before your own.
[scoffs] You don't understand. I am a celebrity.
It is all about me. It has been for decades. [chuckling]
That's the point of celebrity. So I have to be reprogrammed.
I have to unlearn things like shoving and taking.
-You know… -Yes.
I need help with that. I need a…
teacher.
Please.
Let's go someplace and talk about how to be good human beings.
Apples & Bees?
Hi.
Thanks for meeting me. I was afraid you wouldn't come--
Thanks for meeting me. I was afraid you wouldn't come-- What do you want?
-I'm sorry about what happened. -Were you in on it?
Emma! You know me. Do I?
What is this?
What are we?
-No, you know what we are. -No, I don't.
Do you know what it was like standing there in that stupid dress alone in the gym,
knowing that people got together and planned the best way to hurt me?
-That must've been awful. -It was.
But the worst part…
The worst part was that you didn't come even though you knew what happened.
You didn't come and try and hold my hand or take me out of there.
-I couldn't, okay? -Why?
You know what my mother is like.
She's a complete and total control freak.

I saw it on CNN. They said that Edgewater, Indiana overflows with bigotry.
Hey, look. It's that guy from Talk to the Hand.
Hey, guys. I was just taking a walk, enjoying the sweet scent of Americana.
We're not interested.
I feel like there's an ideological divide between us,
but if we got to know each other, we could bridge it, right?
So I'll start.
I'm Trent. I'm an actor.

I'm sure your drama teachers told you about that institution.

-[Kaylee] Me? -Yes. Why do you hate gay people?
-Hey, I'm a good person, right, Shelby? -Yeah. Yeah, we all are.
-[girl] We go to church. -Yeah, we're Christian.
Well, I'm sure there are a lot of rules in the Bible that you break every day.
Well, that's different.
Is it?
You can't cherry-pick the Bible, choosing which parts you want to believe.

Uh, you don't? -[gospel music playing] -Then what's this?

Oh, come on. You guys don't even feel, like, slightly bad for Emma?
-I mean, you guys used to hang out. -That was before she turned gay.
Maybe she was always gay.
Exactly, because that's the way God made her, Shelby.
-Come on. What? -Whatever.
-Hey! It's the Godspell kids! -Hey, Trent. What's going on?
-[Trent] You guys'll back me up. -With what?

-[Principal Hawkins] Hi, everyone. -Hi!
It's okay, it's okay. He knows what we're up to.
And I'm on board, as long as Emma's comfortable with it.
Well, she's outta luck, 'cause we got nothin'.
Uh, it's not over yet. Dee Dee.
-I have arranged a TV appearance for her… -[Angie] Mmm!
-…on Eddie Sharpe. -[gasps]
She's booked for tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m.
Not the house in the Hamptons.
[inhales sharply] Yes.
Hello, Eddie, it's Dee Dee, your brutalized ex-wife.
But I'm calling on another matter entirely.
What I did…
was I put her interest ahead of my own.
-[Principal Hawkins] Mmm-hmm. -I expect nothing in return.
I have no agenda other than to ease someone else's burden.
Oh, Dee Dee, that is incredibly generous of you!
I know! [laughing]
Hang on. What kind of audience are we talking about here?
I mean, Eddie Sharpe on a weekday? Fifteen, sixteen million!
-Dee Dee! You saved the day! -Yeah, I did.
-I love giving back. It's my new thing. -[Principal Hawkins] There you go!
-Emma! -Hi.
Emma! You wait until you hear the news.
Dee Dee has got you booked on Eddie Sharpe tomorrow at 8:00
with an audience of 16 million people!
Wow! That's amazing. Thank you.
Oh, I'm just… I'm so happy to be able to help.
And I'm gonna take a stand.
And I want to thank you all because without your love and support,
I never would have found the courage.
But, um, the reason I came was to tell you that…
I'm going to do it my way.
I'm not going on TV.
-You owe me a house! -[Barry] Oh, my God.
-You owe me a house! -[Barry] Go, go!
-[Emma] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. -Run! Run!
She owes me a house! She owes me my house!
I need my house. [continues shouting]
She's a very passionate woman.
[Emma] So here's what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna do my thing, and in the end,
there will be a kick-ass prom in Edgewater, Indiana, for everybody,
regardless of who they happen to love.
I know it.
That… That would be wonderful.
And when that happens, I want you to be my date.
Wait, but what about…
We broke up.
Just say yes.
There's no one in the world I'd rather go with.
-God. [sighs] Don't make me cry. -[both chuckle]
Of course I will go with you.
We are going to the prom.
God.

Hello, interweb.
My name is Emma Nolan, and I'm 17 and I'm gay.
You might have heard about the fake prom in Indiana.
That was me.
It was awful in every way,
and I spent a lot of time feeling sorry for myself.
So I wrote a song for all the people out there
who love someone in a way that the world just doesn't understand.
I know we all have stories to tell, and here's mine.
♪ Some hearts can conform Fitting the norm ♪
♪ Flaunting their love for all to see ♪
♪ I tried to change Thinking how easy life could be ♪
♪ I just kept on failing ♪
♪ I guess that was a sign ♪
♪ That there wasn't much hope ♪
♪ For this unruly heart ♪
♪ Of mine ♪
♪ Then you came along And right or wrong ♪
♪ Feelings began to overflow ♪
♪ We had to hide Thinking that no one else could know ♪
♪ And not having you near me Was where I drew the line ♪
♪ So I had to conceal ♪
♪ This poor unruly heart ♪
♪ Of mine ♪
Hi, Emma. I loved your video. Where do I start?
I think my parents always knew.
I felt so alone. Nothing made sense until him.
She's the best thing in my life.
The only good thing.
But we're always hiding.
[fan on laptop] You're not the only one.
♪ And though I don't know how or when ♪
♪ But somehow I learned to see ♪
[all] ♪ No matter what The world might say ♪
♪ This heart is the best part of me ♪
♪ So fear's all in the past Fading so fast ♪
♪ I won't stay hidden anymore ♪
♪ I'm who I am ♪
♪ And I think that's worth fighting for ♪

♪ Of mine ♪
♪ Mine ♪
♪ And nobody out there ♪
♪ Ever gets to define ♪
♪ The life I'm meant to lead ♪
♪ With this unruly heart ♪
♪ Of mine ♪
This is too much. It's too much for my heart.
That's why I wanted you guys to see it. I've never been more proud.
-So when is the prom? -There's no money left.
-What? What do you mean? -We already had a prom, remember?
[Principal Hawkins] There could be a miracle. It's early.
Okay, people, it's Mickey and Judy time. Okay?
This is the part where we roll up our sleeves
and we put on a prom with our own bare hands.
-We are giving Emma the prom she deserves. -Okay, wait a minute.
How much are we talking about? What does a prom cost?
I mean, it's not a school-sanctioned event, so we have to pay a rental fee on the gym.
DJ.
-Lighting. -Sound system. [Principal Hawkins] It's still thousands of dollars.
Right. Um…
Okay, here.
Charge that until it declines, which will be soon.
I had to declare bankruptcy after my self-produced Notes on a Scandal.
[Angie] Yes. Well…
I don't have a credit card anymore because I…
Well, I just… [exhales]
But, anyway, you can have what I have in my Venmo and there's my cash.
It's all yours.
-Thanks, Angie. [chuckles] -Sure.
Okay. This is my card from the Actors Federal Credit Union.
Just cross your fingers and swipe.
All right. Well, we're making some progress here. This is a nice start.
-We still have a long way to go. -[Angie] Mmm-hmm.
-Dee Dee. Dee Dee? -What?
Oh, come on. I know you've got an American Express black card in there.
There's no limit on that baby.
Please, please, no. I already gave a house.
Exactly, so this is nothing. Come on.
[seductively] Eleanor.
Franklin.
[dramatically] Why does being good cost so much… money?
-Well done, Dee Dee. -[chuckles]
-[Trent] Yes! -We're fully financed.
-[Trent] Yeah! -Okay, well, let's give this girl a prom!
-Yes! -[Barry] Okay, let's do it!
[Trent] The students will want to see us perform some sort of number.
So, look, I… I've been thinking hard about this.
That thing that you and I were talking about.
-I called your mother. -What?
Yeah, I found her number in your phone.
How did you know my passcode?
Well, I guessed. 9481. Beyoncé's birthday.
[chuckling] Got it on the first try.
-Well, why would you do that? -Because, Barry…
-I know you couldn't do it on your own. -What did she say?
Well, I think maybe you should let her tell you that.
[Vera] Hi, Barry.
Okay. I'm gonna give you some space, and I'll be in the faculty lounge, okay?
No. No, you… You don't get to do this. Okay?
You don't get to show up out of nowhere. Okay? No. Uh-uh.
I came all this way, Barry.
Well, you can just turn around and go right back, okay?
You called me, didn't you?
That was you who called and hung up, wasn't it?
I handled this all wrong, honey. And I'm so sorry.
Okay. You just… stay…
When you told us what you were, who you were,
your father and I, we were scared.
We hardly knew what gay meant.
We both thought that somehow we had failed you,
like maybe it was our fault.
-So it's okay now? -[sighs]
What I needed was a mother who didn't know if it was okay
but loved me anyway.
You think you were scared? How do you think I felt?
[sobbing] I know, Barry. I failed you and I know.
That's gonna be on my heart till the day I die.
[voice breaking] But all I can say is I was wrong and I'm sorry.
What about Dad? Is he here?
Uh, no. He's just not…
He's not there yet.
I'm sorry to say.
Oh, Barry.
Please forgive me. I've missed you so much.
[crying] I missed you too.
I did.
I missed you too. I missed you.
♪ Then you came along And right or wrong… ♪
-Aren't you tired of watching that? -Eight million people have seen it.
I just don't understand it.
Well, I think it's brave.
The kids are saying there's gonna be another prom.
-[scoffs] -Someone's offered to pay for it.
Who?
This is so generous of you guys.
We had to do something after you broke the Internet.
It was crazy. The numbers just kept going up,
and then the Indiana Star called, and then the Washington Post--
Hello, everyone.
Can't have a prom without flowers.
So I will put these out on the table, even though I'd rather just give them all to you.
-[Angie] Oh, my God! -[Barry] Is this for real?
Can I just say you guys are the best middle-aged people I've ever met.
That is…
Oh, honey…
We need to talk to you about something, okay? And I think it's…
It's important that you understand
the real reason why we came here to visit you.
-It wasn't for the Hoosier pie? -[chuckles]
Well, I mean, um…
-We were in a show. -A wonderful show.
Well, I mean…
[hesitating] And we got blasted by the critics.
They called us narcissists, and it hurt.
And it hurt because I guess they were right.
So we looked around for a cause that might give us some credibility.
[chuckling] Maybe get us some good press.
Like building a house for Habitat for Humanity.
Then we realized that we're not capable of building anything.
And then I found you on Twitter.
I mean, it was just dumb luck, but meant to be.
Well, I'm sorry to tell you this, but…
you're going to build something.
-You're going to build a prom. -[all chuckling]
Stop it! Stop this, please!
Who gave you people permission to be in here?
-I did. -You should have consulted with the PTA.
Well, this is not a school event, so I'm not obliged to get the PTA's approval.
I'm going to be as clear as I possibly can.
Your beliefs are not our beliefs.
Hey, Emma. Can we talk to you?
I was a jerk, and I'm sorry.
You deserve to go to prom just like any other kid.
What? I thought you hated me. I thought you all hated me.
Oh, they hated you.
They hated you with a burning passion stoked by centuries of intolerance
and the lack of a drama program.
I'm sorry, too, Emma.
You know, you explain things really well. You should be, like, a teacher.
-Oh, you should be our drama teacher! -[girl] Yes, please!
You should do it. Do it.
-You're hired! -I'm a teacher!
-As a temp. -Absolutely.
No, no, no! This is-- This is what I was afraid of.
-Mom! -Let me finish!
No, you have got to stop talking and just listen, okay?
People don't turn gay.
They are who they are.
No. You don't know what you're saying.
I do.
I do.
Look, I know how you were raised, but… the world's a different place.
And sure, it's not great, but…
it's… it's better because of people who have the courage to be who they are.
People like her.
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I just want to be me.
So here goes.
-I love you, Emma Nolan. -Oh, my God.
I love you too.
Alyssa… No, listen to me.
You are very young and you are confused.
You don't know what is…
[voice breaking] I just don't want you to have a hard life.
It's already hard.
-Mom, I love you-- -No. [shushes]
We can talk about this tonight. Okay? Okay?
-Okay. -Okay. Okay.
Mom…
-[Emma whispers] Just breathe. -Hey, why don't we decorate?
Yes, let's decorate. Let's decorate everything.
-[Trent] All right. -[Sheldon] I need you here.
[Dee Dee] We're gonna make this place really pretty.
Look at that!
I'm so proud of you. Look at what you did.
I can't believe this.
-[Emma gasps] -[Alyssa] I think we're early.
-Yeah, it looks like it. -Mm-hmm. You want to hit up the punch bowl?
No. There's only one thing that I want to do.

for women, it involves so many decisions
about how you're gonna present yourself to the world.
'Cause there's kind of standard protocol
for how a man running for office, like,
should dress.
You either put on a suit,
or you put on a light color shirt, slacks, and you roll up the sleeves.
Or...
I mean, those are pretty much your two options.
Part of me is, like, trying to brace myself
because people keep telling me,
"They're gonna try to make sure that you...
just never show your face in your community again."
How do you prepare for something you don't know is coming?
Hey, everyone, I'm getting ready to go file today.
Super excited.
It's official. We are in the race.
Go, Team Vilela.
Hey, everyone, it's Cori Bush, candidate for United States Congress,
here in Missouri's first district.
[man] Hello, everybody, this is Anthony Vincent Clark.
-[woman 1] Hi, it's Rashida Tlaib. -[woman 2] Second district of Nebraska...
[Paula] We shouldn't have to worry about self-serving politicians
catering to coal barons
instead of catering to our families and communities.
I plan to Primary Joe Manchin in 2018,
and I'm asking you to stand with me.
...with some of these incumbent Democrats who are facing primary challenges.
[man] But are the progressives going to make the Democrat primaries messy...
[Alexandria] We're running to organize.
We're running to redefine the political landscape in New York City.
And here's the best part about all of this:
We're not running to make a statement.
We're not running to pressure the incumbent to the left.
We're running to win.
[Alexandria] Morning, guys. Buenos días.
If I was, like, a normal, rational person,
I would've dropped out of this race a long time ago. [chuckles]
[Alexandria] People don't see waitresses as having a, quote-unquote, "real job."
But my experience in hospitality
has prepared me so well for this race.
I'm used to being on my feet 18 hours a day,
I'm used to receiving a lot of heat.
I'm used to people trying to make me feel bad.
They call it "working class" for a reason.
Because you are working non-stop.
Americans aren't asking for a lot.
They're just asking to get by.
And they're just asking for politicians to be brave enough to help them get by.
[male voice] This is WNYC FM, New York.
Every political machine has a leader
and the most powerful of them are known everywhere as the boss.
In Queens, that's Congressman Joe Crowley,
Chairman of the County Democratic Committee
and also the Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus,
making him the fourth most powerful Democrat in Congress.
What we're talking about is better jobs, better pay and a better future.
[female voice] Crowley hasn't had a primary challenger in 14 years, until now.
[Alexandria] I just want to thank everyone here so much.
I mean, this is the work.
What I do is just talk to people all the time.
Just members of our community, all the time.
And that is the organizing and that is the work
of running a grassroots campaign.
This is not just about Democrat versus Republican,
in fact, it's so far away from that.
It's not Left or Right, it's up and down.
[Alexandria] We're up against an opponent, he's taken three million dollars per cycle
from Wall Street, real estate, and pharmaceutical companies.
We need to have the courage to stand up for working people
and stand up against corporate interests.
[man] Let's assume all the energy in this room
can get you on the ballot and into office.
How then do we overcome the drop in power?
We're trading a guy who's vying for the Speaker of the House,
for somebody who's more in our corner and has a lot less power.
[Alexandria] I think we really need to look at...
what that power does now.
When it matters, he doesn't stand up for us.
When it matters, he doesn't advocate for our interests.
We have to have the courage to say, "We can do better."
We can do better. It's not gonna be a loss.
[man 1] What would you reckon the...
evidence of selflessness is?
[man 2] She is pretty doggone stellar.
I talked to her today.
Has not thought of running before.
I talked about the economic platform, she loved it.
There wasn't a piece of the platform she wasn't onboard with 100%.
[woman] All those in favor of moving her to the next round, raise your hand.
[man] At the first time, we've gotten 100%?
I think that might have been the first time!
[man] For Brand New Congress and Justice Democrats,
the biggest shared goal is removing
the corrupting influence of money in politics.
[Corbin] The idea is to provide an alternative path to Congress
outside of the current one that exists.
Right now we have a path through lobbyists and through special interest groups.
Right now our Congress is 81% men,
it's mostly white men, it's mostly millionaires,
it's mostly lawyers.
[man] Most people in there are just trying to figure out
how to keep their job and win their next election.
That's not the thinking that's going to fix climate change,
or mass incarceration,
or these giant problems that are facing us.
The only way this works is if--
is if we really capture America's imagination.
[woman 1] We're looking at Democrats and Republicans
to run in the midterms in 2018.
[woman 2] Non-career politicians.
So, nurses, teachers, engineers, workers...
[woman 3] We don't care about party.
We just want to get stuff done.
If we elect working people,
working people can have representation in Congress.
We can change the way we see government,
change the way we see politics in this country.
[Saikat] So, I'm so glad all of y'all are here.
This-- This whole thing is making me feel like
there's no way that we're gonna go stop this snowball that's now getting rolling.
It's going to become an avalanche in a couple of months.
[Saikat] We want to actually create that grassroots-funded machine
that can be your real opposition to the current institutional powers
and that can really give power back to the people
and really keep that power. Right?
[Alexandria] I felt like there was...
such a wide divide in this nation
in terms of how we understand each other,
how we speak to one another,
and, in December,
I get a call from Isra saying,
"You've been nominated to Brand New Congress."
And I was like, "What?"
[Alexandria] You know, I'm from New York,
and New York isn't Democrat versus Republican.
New York is establishment
versus whatever poor, stray cat thinks you can stand up against them.
And then if you do stand up against them,
they take you and they consume you.
I never really saw myself going into politics.
But now that I sit here in this room with you all, I just feel like...
we can only accomplish great things together.
I feel like I have to because of you guys now.
You have to be fearless, 'cause they're going to come after you.
They are, this is no joke, y'all. They're going to come after you.
But you have to be fearless.
Nobody owns you yet.
You don't owe anybody anything yet.
So, run.
You got people who are waiting for y'all to come out this room.
To come back to Florida, and to Georgia,
and to Alabama, and to New York.
They want to be excited again.
Our future is in this room.
-I'm nervous. -[woman laughs]
[Alexandria whispers] What do you say? When they say, "Who is it?"
What do you say?
[woman] Hello?
Hi, my name is Mathew, I'm out here canvassing
for a Congressional candidate named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
for the Democratic Party in 2018.
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a minute.
[woman] No, I'm sorry. Now is not a good time.
-Okay, thank you. -Thank you.
Easy.
[woman] Me no speak English.
-[Alexandria] Oh, what do you speak? -[woman] Greek, Greek.
Oh, Greek?
[man] Why do you let people in the country even though they're not legal--?
You know, they say, "Okay, we're gonna forgive you."
-[overlapping dialogue] -I don't agree with that.
I'm a Democrat, and I don't even agree with that.
Well, I think--
I voted for Trump, and I am a Democrat. And she did too.
[Alexandria] It's so crazy, 'cause speaking to groups of people...
-[man] Right, it's easy. -[Alexandria] It's way easier.
[Alexandria] In the beginning,
the fundamental question is like, "Why you?"
"Why do you think you can do this?"
The reason "why"
was 'cause nobody else would.
So, literally anybody could, right?
Because the alternative is no one.
[Alexandria] We have never seen this, at this scale, in American history.
We have slates and legions of candidates
that are running now and in 2018
that have rejected corporate funds.
Many of us, you know, we're doing something very "controversial."
We're daring to actually force the primary.
People would say, "How dare you mount a challenge
to someone who's so established?"
Well, if they're good enough, they'll win.
And if we're good enough, we'll win.
[Paula] She said, "You shouldn't show your emotion,
because women are considered fragile if you do.
And you need to be more of a bitch."
[man] That is the worst advice anyone can fucking give.
[Paula] He said, "And when you go to the people in West Virginia
and you tell 'em you're serving them," he says,
"You need to tell them that you're their bitch."
-I said, "I'm not a dog." -[man] No! That's horri--
-That's such horrible advice! -[all laughing]
We work harder in these races just 'cause we're women.
-We're not rich, white dudes in suits. -[man] Absolutely.
I don't know where I'm going.
-[man] How are you feeling? -Nervous.
[Paula] Was this a good ending?
Let me read those.
Okay, so I'm taking these away from you for a second.
Why?
Words don't matter so much right now as you, right?
You're up there to convey your emotion and to inspire people.
The words are useful in that, but that's not the most important thing.
The most important thing is you.
-Do I look okay? -You look awesome.
Don't worry about any of that stuff.
I just want you to just focus on relaxing and breathing.
And as soon as you get on that stage,
before you walk through that door, smile.
And keep smiling until you start talking.
[woman] Please welcome, from the great state of West Virginia,
Paula Jean Swearengin.
[Paula] West Virginia is one of the poorest and sickest states in this nation.
But I want you guys to know one thing,
West Virginians are strong,
we are proud,
and we won't give up.
[shouting] No American should have to beg
for something so basic as a clean glass of water!
My name is Paula Jean.
I am a coal miner's daughter,
running for the U.S. Senate, and I am mad as hell.
[Paula] As we go around the block,
I'll try to point out some of the houses that I know that people had cancer.
This was my house,
where I raised my kids.
My neighbor's daughter ended up with a rare form of bone cancer.
I know this lady had cancer.
There's a person in that house that has cancer.
And our leadership's not hearing us. They're in bed with the industries.
[man] It's gone.
I mean, this mountain at this point right here, it was really high,
and they took all of that out.
They just leveled this mountain here.
That community down there, they're breathing in toxins every day.
Whether their water's polluted or not, they're breathing in that air.
[Paula] You talk about jobs, you can probably count here
how many people's out here on this site for miles and miles and miles.
Where are the jobs?
We don't have to do this.
If another country come in here, blew up our mountains
and poisoned our water, we'd go to war.
But industry can.
[Manchin] As you know, I have a real problem with what's going on,
the demonizing of coal, it seems, by a whole group of people
that don't seem to understand the life that we all have
is because of the domestic energy that we have right here in this country.
[Paula] Tell her what you think about me running for office.
[Helen] It scares me to death.
Her running all over the state,
her being up there with all those senators and stuff scares me to death.
I'm her momma. [chuckles]
There's been people in this state even in the coal industry
that has just disappeared.
You never find them no more.
I'm wondering in which hole of these mines they're in, you know.
'Cause I know how things was done in my daddy's day.
And I don't think it's changed much.
[Paula] I come from a long line of coal miners.
My daddy died early... to power America.
We've been collateral damage.
People have seen West Virginians as...
we don't have no teeth, no shoes, and no brains.
[Paula] I just think they underestimate us.
At the end of the day, we're gonna fight for each other.
They need to know that.
We're coming out of the belly of the beast kicking and screaming.
[Alexandria] Basically, what political machines do is they suppress democracy.
The whole game here is to prevent you
from getting on the ballot in the first place.
Joe Crowley is not just a Congressman.
He's the Congressman,
he's the Chairman of the Queens Democratic Party,
he's the district leader.
[Alexandria] Joe Crowley has appointed every board of elections judge.
When you turn in your signatures to get on the ballot,
any tiny little discrepancy in the signature,
they toss the signature out.
So, even though the actual requirement is 1,250...
because we're challenging the boss...
we need to collect 10,000 signatures.
Good morning.
-Hi, are you a voter? -Yes.
[Alexandria] I'm running for Congress in the area.
We just need to collect signatures to get on the ballot.
-[woman] Who would you be running against? -Joseph Crowley.
-No. -Yes.
I'm gonna stick with Crowley, thanks.
-Okay. -All right, I'm gonna sign anyway.
-[woman] I'm a Crowley supporter. -Oh! Okay. No worries. No worries.
Well, keep an eye out. Thank you.
[Alexandria] One of my problems when I'm trying to be polite to someone,
I feel like my voice goes up two octaves.
Like, "Hi!" Like... [laughs]
[Alexandria] This is my niece.
She's gonna be the next one.
-She's gonna get it after me. -Oh, yeah. [laughs]
Hi, my aunt's running for Congress.
You got it, bro.
For every-- For every ten rejections you get one acceptance.
And that's how you win everything.
[man] I killed the pint of Americone Dream yesterday.
-[music fades out] -Sorry.
-I know we brought it from Manhattan-- -I didn't have one spoon of that.
-Yeah. I-- I can't help it. -That's messed up.
-[Riley scoffs] -That is really messed up.
You're like so unrepentant about it, too.
-You're like, "Yes, I did it. -I mean, well--
[Riley] You wanna make coffee or tea?
-I probably shouldn't have coffee. -You probably shouldn't.
[woman] All right. Then give me the other two,
and then once you sign it, you give it back to Clarence.
Clarence said that I'm gonna need 30.
Got it.
[Alexandria] So, petition cleaning, basically what we're doing,
we're going through all of these names,
making sure that everything is legible.
[woman] This stuff seems like a whole lot of stupid work.
But, you'd rather sit and do this for three hours
than for somebody drag you to court for six days.
And what they will do sometimes if they have enough stuff to play with,
they know that eventually you're gonna get on the ballot,
but they're gonna keep you busy until the day before election.
So then you have no time.
-So, the Whiteheads are like, legendary. -[indistinct chatter]
They started organizing on their own.
Figuring all this stuff out from scratch.
This is the war room for every insurgent campaign in Queens.
[woman] We're a country that's supposed to be set up,
where the people are supposed to have the final say.
What happens is those who are already entrenched,
select people.
It's going up against the establishment in a true sense of the word.
So you have to make sure
you have as much stuff in order as possible.
[man] Well, guys, we got a lot of work to do.
[Alexandria] He can't get challenged by any down-ballot incumbent.
Anyone who wants to keep their job in New York City...
would never dream of challenging Joe Crowley.
It has to come from outside of Queens.
It has to come from someone who's new on the political scene
that they don't foresee coming,
that they can't offer a job or pressure in another way.
And it has to be someone that represents her community
in more ways than one.
Basically, an insurgent, outside, grassroots candidate
that's a woman of color from the Bronx.
[Alexandria] We're like walking closer and I'm like...
-Nice to meet you. Name's Barbara. -Alexandria.
Barbara? Nice to meet you.
-Paul. -Paul? Nice to meet you.
Running for Congress out in the Bronx and Queens.
[woman] Okay, well...
Here you go.
[Alexandria] Everybody said we couldn't do it.
And then they saw how much money we had.
And they saw that we had, like, two dollars in December,
and they're, like, "There's no way."
And here we are...
April 12th, 2018.
And we're on the ballot.
Unless he sues us. [laughs]
[Darryl] What does it say?
"Born to Rebel"? [laughs]
That's-- That's you. [laughs]
Fix it and I wouldn't have to rebel.
Yeah. Fix it.
-Born to rebel? -Born to rebel.
Listen. We wanna talk about something.
If you look at first Congressional district,
we're still number one in murder per capita.
We're in the top three in African American poverty.
We're talking about mass incarceration.
We're talking about for African Americans,
who are almost 50 percent of the district,
to have a black congressman as long as they have had... [man] Right.
...and still have not made any significant gains?
[man] That's ridiculous.
This is Cori Bush's time.
[Darryl] Dr. King talked about the fierce urgency of now.
[Darryl] That the time is always right to do right.
If change is gonna happen in St. Louis,
-this is our moment. -This is our moment.
We have to believe that you are that change.
[Cori] I'm a registered nurse, I'm an ordained pastor,
and I'm a mother of two teenagers.
I was not trying to become an activist.
Didn't set out to do that.
This is the district where Mike Brown was murdered.
I only live six minutes from Ferguson.
[man] This is the police.
Clear the area immediately.
[man] You must clear the area immediately.
[reporter] Chaos in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri.
The crowd's furious
over the police shooting of unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown.
[Cori] It was like a battle zone at home.
I took to the streets to lend a hand as a nurse.
What I was wanting to see was justice happen.
It didn't happen, so I just kept going back, again and again.
[Cori] This district was able to affect the entire world.
Just regular, everyday people.
People are now waking up to see
that the problems that we have in our district,
are problems that we ourselves can fix.
[man] Smile more.
[man] All right. Here we go for reals. One, two, three.
One, two, three. [camera shutter clicks] Awesome.
[man] One, two and three.
That was fantastic. Cool.
Here's what we're looking at.
You put that light on my face, like-- Wow, you know what you--
-[man laughs] -You know how to work my melanin.
I have to be... appreciate that.
He workin' my melanin. Everybody can't work with melanin.
-[all laughing] -That is a compliment I haven't heard.
[Cori] Being a woman of color, our image is really scrutinized.
You have to speak like this, you have to dress like this.
I decided that, yeah, I don't care.
-[man] One, two, three. -[camera shutter clicks]
[Cori] Basically you deal with it.
You know, people in my district, this is how we look.
I'm going to serve and represent the people of my district.
[man] Anybody can run, but you're doing a walk-through.
-Yeah. A walk-through. -That's why I'm running.
Because this shouldn't be about one person being a king, being like, "Kiss my ring."
It's not about that.
-Because we don't get help that way. -[man] You're right.
It's gotta be about us.
It's gotta be about us thinking about us,
caring about us, speaking about us.
-Mm-hmm. -[Cori] Not being afraid.
Yeah. Looking for a real change.
Looking for some real change.
-[man] Not promises. -[Cori] Oh, no.
-Action. -Action. Action.
[man] St. Louis, in Missouri's first Congressional district,
had been represented by William or his son Lacy Clay
since 1969.
If you look at the progress that has been made
over the past 50 or 60 years, it's been remarkable.
[man] So, you're running against, uh...
[Cori] Clay.
Okay.
-How you doing? -I'm good.
Well, you have to forgive, 'cause it's just out of habit on--
on the Clay family
-from way, way back. -Yeah.
I know my pop was saying,
"Who?"
[man] But, of course, the whole point, you get seniority in that place up there,
it does count.
[Cori] Yeah. It-- But who does it count for?
Is it definitely counting for us? Do we feel the seniority?
I admire your guts because this is an uphill battle.
Because it's almost odd--
You know, it's not even a thought
for most of the folks that I know that vote.
Election time come round. "Okay. Clay."
That's one of the few ones--
Nobody even bother looking at anything else.
I ain't really seen no Democrat with the guts
to go up against the Clays in a long time.
[man] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to 950 Lounge
Miss Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. -Thank you.
-Welcome to the show. -Thank you, guys, so much.
[Alexandria] So New York City and New York politics is wild!
We're so used to seeing our elected officials in handcuffs
-that it's like no big deal anymore. -[all laughing]
Our current Congressman, Joseph Crowley,
never even won the seat.
His mentor used a loophole in New York City election law
-to appoint him as the Democratic nominee. -Yes. [man] Wow.
He doesn't even live here.
-He lives in Virginia, y'all. -What!
-Yes. -All right, so hold on. You got a--
-I'm assuming he's a Caucasian man. -Yes, he is.
You got a Caucasian man
that's a Congressman for the Bronx, Queens, and Rikers Island
that lives in Virginia.
It just don't make no common sense to anybody.
I don't know what y'all doing.
If you popped him in the Bronx, he would get lost.
[woman] I am so happy that I get to be here today
as a surrogate for Congressman Crowley.
He is extremely saddened he couldn't be here with us today,
and it's not because he did not want to be here,
and because he doesn't believe that these types of forums are important.
[Alexandria] We are making excuses for absentee leadership.
This is not a debate!
With all respect-- With all respect to Councilwoman Palma,
I thank you for your service to our community. I do.
But I am the only one running for Congress in this room.
[moderator] Question is about trusting Congressman Crowley's judgment
when he votes for the Iraqi war.
I trust Congressman Crowley's judgment because he has served this community.
I built a great partnership
in making sure that whatever I needed to do for this community,
that the partner that I had was the Congressman
who has never failed to deliver for this community.
Thirty seconds.
The vote for the Iraq war was disastrous.
It destabilized an entire region.
[moderator] What do you say about US role towards Israel-Palestine,
and moving the embassy and settlements?
[exhales deeply] Yes.
-No, this is a regular question. -Oh, regular question. Oh!
One minute.
I believe that the Congressman supports that position.
That's it? Okay. Rebuttal.
I think that moving the embassy--
Moving the embassy was a profound mistake
in US foreign politics.
[Alexandria] Profound mistake!
[Palma] Listen, you know, I--
I would allow him to elaborate more on his position on certain issues.
[man] Tell him to come right here.
And-- Again, right? We explained--
We explained why he's not here, and it's not disrespecting the Bronx.
[Alexandria] So I wanna thank everyone for participating in this process,
because for so long, we haven't had these forums.
The only reason we are here is because we organized
for the first primary election in 14 years in New York 14th.
-For once, we have a choice. -[scattered applause]
For once, we have a choice.
Okay. Thank you and good night.
-Thank you. -The candidates will stay--
[man] Before you break.
I have a question here.
I think one of the questions that was sent to you
is of great concern to the African community here.
There's close to 300 businesses in this district
that are owned by Yemeni Americans who are suffering from the travel ban--
[moderator] Meantime, this last half hour,
-you can go up to the candidates. -But it said till eight o'clock.
African immigrants, they're feeling left out.
Because most of them have come here through the diversity visa.
[man] Several of the individuals here have families stuck
outside the country for several months.
I hope to have the honor of having the support of the Yemeni community,
but I also acknowledge that I have to earn it and deserve it
every single time.
[Alexandria speaking Arabic] Hello. Happy Eid.
[in Arabic] My name is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
I'm trying out here.
I'm running for Congress out here in New York's 14th Congressional district.
And it is so important that we go out and vote on Tuesday, June 26th.
[moderator] If you agree with what-- you know, what I say,
raise your hand.
But if it's a no for you, don't raise your hand.
Support a woman's right to choose.
Support the Paycheck Fairness Act in eliminating the wage gap.
Love this room.
Support allowing transgender soldiers to serve in the military.
All right.
Raise your hand if you refuse to take corporate PAC money.
-All right. -[crowd cheering]
[crowd] Amy, Amy!
[moderator] All right.
[Amy] Everybody that knows me knows that on day one,
I will co-sponsor HR-676 Medicare for all.
It is time to join the other Democrats in office right now
that are standing up and saying, "Enough is enough!
We're not gonna accept any more money from the hospital,
the insurance companies and pharma,
and we can have the people behind the party again."
-[crowd cheering and applauding] -[moderator] Thank you.
[Amy] They're actually now posting that I'm a Marxist.
I don't even know what a Marxist is.
Commie, and socialist, and a piece of shit,
and a bitch.
And, you know, I look like I'm Russian,
go back to my country in Mexico...
You know what? Bring it on.
[woman] Right now we could really use your help.
We are a completely grassroots-powered movement.
It's gonna be a close race.
It's, you know, obviously it's a crowded field.
Oh, hell, yeah! Okay, that's what I like to hear.
I'm cleaning up after a bunch of kids. [chuckles]
I'm the house mom, the den mother.
So I'm gonna make this disclaimer.
I'm Amy Vilela. I do not approve of this mess.
My name's Amy, and I am not a career politician. Yes.
I was someone that should not be able to run for Congress.
I was a single mom. I was on Medicaid, WIC, food stamps.
That's right.
Worked my way through college somehow,
-and became a Chief Financial Officer. -Cool.
-[chuckles] Thanks a lot. -No problem, take care.
[Amy] This is not a game to me.
This is not an opportunistic move for me.
You got a good grip.
I turned my back on an executive level job.
I sold my house.
I've gone into debt.
In the beginning, it was a tough decision,
but I would do it again in a heartbeat now.
[woman 1] I'm scared too, because I've never felt this confident...
in a campaign.
[woman 2] It makes me uncomfortable, but I feel like we might win.
Every step of the way, we seem to be on track.
[Joz] We're like in the Amazing Race...
And no one else believes in the path, so they think we're not on track.
They say, you know, "You don't have a shot
if you don't raise $100,000 between now and next week,
or you don't have a shot if you're not gonna put out
targeted mailers, you know,
to women between the ages of 55 and 65 before this date.
After 2016, nothing is predictable. Nothing!
Hi, Amin, this is Amy Vilela.
I was just actually doing my fundraising calls and saw your name.
Didn't know if you'd be able to help us out one last time.
-[Amin] I'm not sure if I can. -Okay.
Did I catch you at a bad time?
[Amy] You know, even $50 would be absolutely amazing.
[man] Really not in a position to go much further, I'm afraid...
[Amy] Sure.
[Amy] Thank you so much.
-What can I put you guys down for? -[woman] Okay.
We would donate $100.
Thank you so, so much, guys.
That really made my day.
[Shannon] So, I was getting curious
where some of our opponents are getting their money.
Particularly Horsford.
He's not taking money from Big Pharma, but...
I've managed to see who he is taking money from.
Culinary Union, executives from MGM and Tropicana,
and the Crystal Sugar Agriculture Fund.
Caesars,
the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Progressive Caucus,
-and Joe Crowley. -[music stops]
Why is Joe Crowley one of the leaders pushing this?
He's pouring all this money into a race
that is two weeks before the New York primary.
[Shannon] If Amy wins against the establishment Dem,
things look a little bit more hopeful for the scrappy fighter from the Bronx.
[Amy] You know, I grew up in poverty.
I was raised by a single mother.
And so I learnt how to fight early on.
Now that my eyes are open,
I cannot and I will not close them again.
[Cori] The person I'm running against is complacent,
but I'm not.
I myself can deescalate a person with a gun.
And I'm not a police officer, so I wonder how come they can't do it!
[Alexandria] I'm running because of Cori Bush.
I'm running because of Paula Jean Swearengin.
I'm running because everyday Americans
deserve to be represented by everyday Americans.
[Paula] And it's time for ordinary people to do extraordinary things.
Let's raise some hell, and take our lives back.
Thank you.
[Alexandria] Here we go.
[woman 2] Oh, we're in the middle--
[Cori Bush] You guys gotta get used to this.
[Alexandria] This thing is growing.
It's-- It's happening.
[Amy] We are beginning our world tour through northern Nevada.
This is a flip district.
We have to keep on the issues,
forget the party divides, forget the parties,
and let's talk about what's really happening.
But there are some things I will not negotiate on.
When we're talking about human life...
human life, and the ability just to survive
and take care of your family and yourself,
I will not buckle.
Ouch!
[Paula] We're clearing this area out.
Ain't nobody been out here for a couple years.
So we can have this event out here.
I look crazy!
[Paula] I am a proud Appalachian woman.
Because there's 10,000 miners that marched that mountain,
and stood up for us, our ancestors did.
One of the biggest labor uprisings
in our nation's history.
This last year, I have hope.
I have hope, and it's because of all of you.
[Cori] And I think about when you get that new person on your job.
I mean, you interview 'em, and they're like so excited,
like, "Oh, I'm gonna do this, and I'm gonna do that,"
and you think about the person that was there before.
How you couldn't get 'em to move out their desk,
-and they were always calling off, and-- -[all laughing]
If we can get even just 15 more people across the country
that will come in in 2019 and perform,
how much greater will we be? And then in two more years, 30.
You know, that's what I'm looking at. Like, it's just continuing to grow.
-[crowd cheering] -I'm running to represent the Bronx.
I'm a third generation Bronxite.
I'm a Latina, I'm a Boricua,
I'm a descendant of Taino Indians.
I am a descendant of African slaves.
I am proud to be an American!
But we have to rise to that promise.
[woman] That's your rice and that's my rice.
Take a little tiny bite.
[woman] The rice is good.
Can you pass her the rice?
[woman] When these two little monsters were little.
I don't know, she was maybe, like, six or seven.
She got upset and said,
"You know what? I am leaving."
-I'm like, "What?" -"I've had enough."
Yeah. I'm, like, "You what?"
"Yeah, I'm gonna leave."
I say, "Okay."
She went, got the suitcase,
put all her clothes there.
She found a nice hat, she put it on.
She went to the curb,
and she's looking both sides,
like, "Hmm... Which way I go?"
So one thing Sandy always had, it was free will.
[male voice] So, here we have Alexandria Ocasio.
A SPECIAL DAY
[Alexandria] For our next thing,
we will take a little look at aliens.
Aliens, this is our aliens issue.
It's taking me down!
[Alexandria] When I was a kid,
about half of New York City high-schoolers would never graduate.
And so, when I was about four, five years old,
my whole extended family chipped in everything they could
for a small down payment on a tiny house about 30 minutes north,
in a place called Yorktown.
I went to public school
in a town where no one looked like me.
And then,
always, always driving down to the Bronx,
because all of my family and our family friends
were still in the Bronx.
My Mom cleaned houses growing up.
She would clean a woman's home in exchange for SAT lessons for me.
My father knew my soul
better than anyone on this planet.
He really made me believe that I had true power in this world.
My Dad passed away when I was in college.
Losing him in a time
when you're just figuring out the world
was really hard.
I didn't know up from down.
[woman 1] If you were to find out, okay, this is coming.
We were digging back, and then there we were.
We make a lot of holes, and then--
[woman 2] Wait, so he left home, but what did you do?
[man] Two week extensions.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-[Alexandria] Thank you. -[Riley] Let it roll.
Thank you.
[Alexandria] So look at this thing.
Everybody in the district got this Victoria's Secret catalogue
of my opponent.
I mean, I'm not trying to gas myself up, or brag, or anything,
but this is the difference between an organizer and a strategist.
What am I trying to get people to do?
Two things: I want them to know my name,
and I want them to know that they need to vote.
"Okay, vote for her, why?"
"End the war on drugs. A hundred percent renewable energy.
Tuition-free public college."
This is how a strategist does it.
Where's the primary date on this?
When you first see it, when you first pull this out of your mailbox.
"Taking on Donald Trump in Washington."
"Delivering for Queens and the Bronx."
Deliver is insider talk.
Deliver means "pork."
"Oh, Alex, you're being too harsh. You're being way too harsh. Give him a chance."
Okay, let's give him a chance. Let's open it up.
Okay, we got this big, beautiful spread here.
Where's the primary date?
"Democrat Joe Crowley
is leading the fight against Donald Trump."
There is nothing about the path forward here.
Trump: three times,
commitments: zero times.
One of these core, core issues
for the Democratic establishment
is that their consultants are garbage.
-[Alexandria sighs] -They're losing.
It's scary that this is, like, the fourth most powerful Democrat in the country,
and this is the type of stuff that he's doing?
[Alexandria] I like-- I like this one.
-This looks like you're on a frontline. -[Saikat] Right.
-And that's where we are. -[Saikat] I like it.
[Alexandria] So what I'd like-- What I kind of envisioned for the back of these things is...
three words or four words
-that are big on the back. -Okay.
So whether it's, like, "Medicare for all"...
Okay.
[Saikat] I think "rejecting the corporate money" is like a big-- it's like a signal,
sort of a big signal, you know.
[Alexandria] Yeah, it is.
And I think it's stronger than the word "progressive".
"Abolish ICE" is another one that we could go to, if you wanted.
I mean, it's kinda cool.
Like, I wouldn't mind having posters that say "abolish ICE". Yeah.
To be in a political poster. They're gonna say, "That's gangster!"
-Like, up in Jackson Heights. -Yeah.
I'll show you what your ads look like.
We got women, unions, criminal justice, under 25,
-over 55, Obama... -Great.
Bengali, English, Spanish.
-Sounds good. -It's moving.
So if you're still following along with us,
I'm gonna plug our Bronx rally again.
It's this Sunday, 2 p.m., Allerton Avenue.
Come out, bring your friends...
[Alexandria] All right, guys, today is
the day of our first ever rally.
[Alexandria] Who's willing to lead an event,
and have a couple friends over
to do any one of the things that we just talked about?
Raise your hand if you're willing to do it.
All right. All right.
Now, if you just raised your hand, I want you to stand up.
Got 'em.
Applause. Give them a round of applause.
[Alexandria] Everybody in this room knows five to ten people.
And then those five to ten people know another five to ten people.
Frankly, big money is very lonely,
and we've got people on our side.
[in Spanish] The Machine here imposes candidates.
But all they want are puppets to do their bidding.
And we're tired of that.
[in Spanish] Because everybody in this community deserves...
[in Spanish] Up with Alexandria! Down with the Machine!
[woman] I'm here with the Democratic Socialists of America,
and we're so proud to endorse Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez today.
[Alexandria] The entire New York political establishment,
they have no idea what's going on.
This race is winnable.
And don't let anybody tell you any different,
because the power out there, I'm telling you, is an illusion.
[man] This election is extremely close. Every vote counts.
So please, please get out to vote.
Can we count on your support for Alex?
Awesome.
[woman] Alexandria is a progressive Democrat who's not taking any corporate donations.
[woman] We've got people, and they've got money.
[man] ...Chester Road, and if you go all the way down Pelham Parkway,
these are all businesses.
-There you go. -Yes!
Thank you.
[Alexandria] Things are accelerating so quickly.
We released our campaign video on Tuesday,
it just...
blew up.
[Alexandria] Before we knew it, we passed $200,000.
And, like, that's a race.
But the question is...
...has this all come with enough time to make a difference?
[Alexandria] He's operating in his kingdom, you know.
They don't let us into senior centers,
but they roll open the red carpet for him.
I mean, look at this.
He has, like, every endorsement ever.
So we'll see.
New York! New York!
Show us your pride!
[crowd] Who you gonna vote for? Ocasio-Cortez!
Who you gonna vote for? Ocasio-Cortez!
[in Spanish] The primary, this June 26th.
The first primary election in 14 years.
Healthcare is a right!
Fight, fight, fight! Healthcare is a right!
Yes, healthcare is a right.
And we gotta get some.
Haven't seen you in a while.
-Re-election time, huh? -Hey, you know, every so often.
You're going to do it. Don't worry.
Hey, Bill. How are you, brother?
You are in my district.
[man] I don't know who that stupid woman is, but I'm voting for you.
Thank you.
She's not stupid, but thank you.
She may not be stupid, but I don't like her anyway.
Good luck, Joe.
[man] Adrienne, can you send me a copy of it?
-Yeah, we'll send you a copy. -Come on in, Bill.
[Alexandria] Yesterday, I get this phone call.
The guy who won't show up to a hundred-person community debate
has now agreed to debate me live on New York One.
Hi, how you doin'?
[Alexandria] I am, frankly, a little scared.
This is either a really big misstep that they've made,
or they have this really well planned.
[Amy] When you're running for office, and you're not, you know,
a typical candidate...
you have to remember your "why."
Why are you doing it?
[Amy] I remember actually the day I put this stone here.
It would have been two years ago.
And it seems like decades ago.
And at that point...
I was so lost.
She didn't wanna be left in one place.
So, as crazy as it makes me look,
I follow her wishes.
You wanna travel? We're gonna travel.
I don't want this to go flying around in the car. [laughs]
That wouldn't be cool.
[Amy] When the time came, they said she was brain-dead.
I knew something was wrong 'cause my sister Ellie had gone over--
She's an RN.
And I looked to my sister and said, "No, Ellie.
No. Don't-- No."
And I saw for the first time, my sister, she just--
I knew she was gone.
But she still was alive for a while.
So, I got into bed and I held her,
and I sang this song I used to sing to her when she was a baby. [sobs]
I played with her hair and told her how much I loved her
until she took her last breath.
[Amy] It's not just our family.
It's 30,000 families a year.
Thirty thousand of us a year...
that are losing loved ones because they don't have insurance.
No one in this great country
should be dying because they don't understand
the intricate system of insurance.
And why is it difficult?
Because of algorithms, because of risk assessment,
because the CFOs
that work in that field
are sitting there figuring out ways to make optimum profit
for their shareholders.
This is a commodity.
My daughter's life wasn't.
We all handle it differently. A lot of grieving parents
that I've been in contact with, they're sort of, like,
really shocked that I'm able to do as much as I'm doing.
For me, it's "How can I not?"
I will never stop.
I'm not going to allow my daughter
to have died for nothing.
[Alexandria] I started waitressing when the financial crisis hit.
My Dad had passed away.
Working in a non-profit just wasn't enough for our family,
because we were about to lose our home.
You're trying to make a $300 student loan bill here,
and your foreclosure installment here...
You just do your best to survive.
That's been the reality for millions of people in this country.
That feel like they're just hanging by a thread.
And they feel like no one's fighting for them,
and everyone's just in it for themselves.
I am debating on behalf of the movement tonight.
This is not about electing me to Congress,
this is about electing us to Congress.
That's what I have to communicate.
I need to take up space.
I need to take up space.
I am here.
-[Alexandria chuckles] -[Riley] What's that?
I don't know. This is me takin' up space.
Sending your energies out.
-I'm gonna try it tonight-- -Aura building.
-I can do this. -I know you can.
I am experienced enough to do this.
I am knowledgeable enough to do this.
I am prepared enough to do this.
I am mature enough to do this.
I am brave enough to do this.
And this whole thing,
this whole time he's gonna tell me I can't do this.
He's gonna tell me I'm small,
that I'm little, that I'm young,
that I'm inexperienced...
[man] Welcome back to Inside City Hall
where we are holding a Democratic Primary debate
for the 14th Congressional District.
Joe Crowley has represented this area in Congress since 1999.
He's being challenged by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
She is a native of the Bronx
who has worked as political aid and as an activist.
Here are tonight's rules. Each can--
For over 20 years, the interests of working families
have been sold off to luxury real estate developers,
Wall Street banks,
and for-profit healthcare corporations.
And for 20 years,
our rents have been going up,
healthcare has been getting more expensive,
and our incomes are staying the same.
Not all Democrats are the same.
And in a district that is overwhelmingly working class,
we deserve a working class champion.
Okay. Thank you. Mr. Crowley?
First of all, thanks a lot for this evening.
It's great to see you, and thanks for participating this evening as well.
I think it's a good opportunity for us to have an--
an exchange of thoughts and ideas
about the issues of concern to our constituency.
If a person loves their community, they would--
they would choose to raise their family here.
They would choose to send their kids to our schools.
When it comes to my kids, I like to keep my kids out of it.
Quite frankly, it's difficult to raise a family as it is.
This job requires me to be away from them
for a very long time, and I'm just doing the best that I can,
quite frankly, as a father.
I'm poised at this point and time to take on this president.
And I've been doing it, just like I did this week,
when I marched in protest
against what's happening at our nation's border,
where this government is separating children from their mothers.
It is antithetical to everything that I believe in,
-and that's what I fight for everyday. -And you know what?
If this organization is as fascist as you have called it...
-I've said it's fascist. -And you have said it's fascist.
Then why don't you adopt the stance to eliminate it?
This is a moral problem.
[woman] It is the first big Primary day of 2018.
[man] Big Primary day.
-[man] All eyes on West Virginia. -[woman] West Virginia.
[woman] You are on the clock.
It's Primary day there and three other states...
[man speaks into megaphone] It's not about red state issues, it's not about blue state issues, it's about people issues.
it's not about blue state issues, it's about people issues.
If Joe Manchin's got you down, come on out,
bring a little bit of hope back to West Virginia,
-and vote for Paula Jean Swearengin today. -[Paula chuckles]
Votefor Paula Jean Swearengin today.
It's Primary day, West Virginia, 2018.
[man] I would just like to report to everyone
that currently we have 35,000 votes from some wonderful,
hardworking West Virginians just like you.
-So can we have a round of applause? -[cheering and applauding]
[man] I'd like to thank you for staying out with us so late,
enjoying a wonderful election night, guys. So thank you.
[Paula] And these counties, these bigger counties have not reported yet.
We've already got 42,000 votes. We might still be able to win this
still, look at the bigger counties.
Manchin is 50,000 ahead of ya.
[man] Joe Manchin has been declared the winner with 69.5% of the vote,
to Paula Jean Swearengin's 30.5% of the vote.
-[man] Not bad. Not bad. -With 7.4% of the precincts reporting...
[woman] So, my thinking is, if Paula was to run as independent,
if she has 30% of the Democratic vote,
there's possibility that she can pull over some Independent
and even Republican voters.
If she runs as an Independent, and Morrissey ends up
as our senator, you're done, your political career is over.
[woman] I'm not telling you not to run as an Independent,
because you are a good candidate,
and I believe in my heart that people are drawn to good candidates.
I'm just asking you where you think you can do the most good.
-Paula Jean? It's Mara. -Hey, Mara.
Great race, by the way.
-Thank you, ma'am. -Very good race.
Do you have a moment to talk to Senator Manchin?
I sure do.
Okay. Hold on one second.
-Paula Jean? -Hi, Senator Manchin.
How are you? I just wanna thank you.
I mean, I congratulate you. Thank you. I've said to everybody...
You're just a classy person, and I appreciate it very much.
Thank you, Senator Manchin, that means a lot.
Whatever we can do--
If you wanna come in, we could sit down and work together,
and look at some of the issues you really have,
and see if we can come together and try to help each other?
I'm happy to do that.
I'd love to come and sit down, Senator Manchin.
I've been wanting that for a long time.
Okay. Why don't you-- You call Mara. Mara has your number.
I'll have Mara schedule it,
that way we can spend some time together. I'd love to do that.
Okay. Yeah.
I would like to see some changes in this state, Senator Manchin.
-I understand. -People are dyin'.
[Cori] This is who we are.
This is the light of St. Louis.
We are the light of St. Louis.
Thank you all.
[woman] Let's take a look at the race
for the Missouri first Congressional district.
Incumbent Lacy Clay, 61% of the vote
against his closest competitor, Cori Bush,
with 31% percent of the vote.
It was the old guard versus the progressive new guard.
Many of you called for change after Ferguson.
It does not look like that is happening, though.
[Amy] Feel like I'm gonna vomit.
...watching that screen pretty carefully behind me...
[Amy] I don't think I've seen Keenan this quiet.
Keenan,
you are the most awesome campaign manager I could ask for.
We did this without knowing shit.
[Keenan] That's true.
[Amy] And you stuck through everything, and were there, and I love you.
[Keenan] I love you too, Amy.
-[woman 1] Okay, we have new results. -[woman 2] Next time I see you...
Shit.
[Amy] Some of us have gotta get through--
It's not about any one of us, individually.
It's about the--the whole movement.
[Alexandria] It's just the reality that in order for one of us to make it through,
100 of us have to try.
[woman] Shalynne would be really proud of you.
[Shannon] I'm not sorry.
I'm not sorry.
I'm not sorry that I'm here.
I'm not sorry that we ran the campaign that we ran.
The same reason that all of us are here,
that hasn't gone away.
The Primary ended,
the injustice has not.
We have a lot of work left to do,
and I for one am not gonna stop doing it
until we fix some things.
[Alexandria] Thinking about 9 p.m. on Tuesday
makes me want to lock myself in a closet.
It will never be the same after Tuesday.
No matter what the outcome, this moment,
I'm never gonna get back.
[man] Go, Lexie!
[moderator] Everyone, try to keep the outbursts to a minimum,
we wanna keep this moving on as best as we can.
So the New York Times editorial board yesterday came out
-with a scathing review of your campaign-- -[Crowley] Wasn't that bad.
-[crowd laughing] -...calling, uh--
They criticize you for, quote,
"your galling snub of a debate in the Bronx."
[crowd] That's right.
[moderator] Is that the reason you're here tonight?
[Crowley] I appreciate the editorial
and I appreciate also the hard work that I've been doing
to win back the support of my constituents here.
When it comes time to standing up against the big banks and Wall Street,
I stood shoulder to shoulder with Barnie Frank
in passing Dod Frank.
I was proud of my work and the effort that I did.
[Alexandria] So let's talk about Dodd-Frank, because after the--
one of the directors of Morgan Stanley emailed
my opponent's campaign director and told him,
"Before you pass Dodd-Frank, you need to kill the Lynch Amendment,"
which protects working families.
He left the floor of Congress, went to that fundraiser,
came back and killed the Lynch Amendment, and then he voted for Dodd-Frank.
So, we need to keep the facts straight here.
[Crowley] You know, you've spoken about the fact that there are
you know, good Democrats and bad Democrats, and...
I'm willing to say that maybe there are some bad Democrats,
people who've let us down.
Hiram Monserrate is someone who actually cut his girlfriend's face
with a broken piece of glass.
My question to you is, why have you sought his support,
why did you go to his club and speak at his club?
I'd like to know why you did that.
So, that's a lie.
I have not s-- I have not sought his support.
I think that that-- that history is-- is absolutely reprehensible,
and you say, "Why are you at his club?"
I was at the only Latino Democratic Club in East Elmhurst and Corona.
-That's where I was. -[applause]
There are teachers there, there are cross-walk guards there,
and that was-- that is who I was talking to that day.
So, while I know that women tend to be made responsible
for the actions of every man in the room,
I am not. I am not.
[Alexandria] After ten years of failed leadership,
we have lost 1,000 Democratic seats nationwide.
We have lost the House, we have lost the Senate,
we have lost the Presidency,
and it would be a profound mistake
if we believe that the same leadership getting us into this mess
is gonna get us out.
Because what's gonna get us out is improved and expanded Medicare for all.
What's gonna get us out is a federal jobs guarantee.
What's gonna get us out is the abolition of ICE.
What's gonna get us out is a $15 minimum wage.
I think-- Miss Ocasio-Cortez, I think you brought a lot of energy,
and I think you--
for someone who is not as experienced,
in terms of public life and public service,
I think you're doing a great job in that vein.
-Well, look, I do-- -[moderator] No outbursts, please!
I do thank her for the energy she's brought to this.
What I'm hoping for is that that energy doesn't end on Tuesday,
that that energy is brought forward to November.
[crowd] Crowley! Crowley!
Hi, man, how are you? Nice to see you.
Crowley! Crowley!
-Hi, how are you? -Hi, don't forget to vote.
Today's an election. We vote right in that corner.
-All right, thank you. -Thank you.
[man] Morning. It's election day. Don't forget to vote.
-Vote for Alexandria. -[Alexandria chuckles]
-Hi, good morning. -Morning. Good luck today.
-Thank you! -[man] Don't forget to vote.
Good morning.
-It's election day, don't forget to vote. -Today's the election...
Thank you.
-[soft piano music playing] -[Alexandria] Ready?
Let's go. Go.
Let's go.
-Hi! How are you, ladies? -Very good.
-Thank you so much. -Okay.
Nice to meet you.
-Your name, please. -Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
You know that. [laughs]
[Alexandria] Thank you!
Bye-bye, all.
-Thank you so much. -Good luck.
-I saw the video clip but I saw-- -Oh, amazing!
I didn't see it all through,
but the first two minutes convinced me to come here.
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.
[Alexandria] This district is 85% Democrat.
So, whoever wins the Primary,
essentially wins the General Election.
There hasn't been any public polling in the race.
When we finally got enough money to do a poll at the last minute,
it showed us about 35 points behind.
[woman] You know where your poll is. So, here's some information about our candidate.
You got it! You got it!
[Alexandria] I get scared of the cynicism
that could result
from people really believing in something
and then it not working out.
-You guys voting today? -Thank you.
Vote for Alex.
Oh... Vote for Alex.
[man] Polls are open for 90 more minutes.
I just don't want to let them down.
[Alexandria] I don't wanna hear anything.
Mami, can you put your phone on mute?
[Blanca] Okay. Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-What? -Oh, my God, no. I just...
[Blanca] Calm down.
Sorry. No, sorry. It's nothing.
[whispers] It's not nothing. I saw press running to our party.
-I love you. -I love you, too.
I'm so proud of you. Whatever happens, okay?
-We did the best we could do. Okay? -We did.
-You did good. -You did great. We did great.
No. I'm scared. I don't know if I want to go in.
I'm scared.
-Should we walk in right now? -Yeah, it's fine.
-You think so? -Let's do it.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Wait, wait, guys. Wait...
-[man1] Oh, my God! -It's me! That's me!
-That's me on the poster! I'm sorry... -[man 2] Uh... Oh, hey!
Hey! I'm sorry! Oh, my God!
What is it?
I can't let--
on television right now.
How are you feeling?
-Can you put it into words? -No.
-I cannot put this into words. -All right.
Your supporters here are very excited for you!
This was a grassroots campaign.
-It absolutely was. -Can you believe the numbers?
I cannot believe these numbers right now.
But I do know that every single person here
has worked their butt off to change the future of the Bronx and Queens.
That's what I know.
[reporter] When you said that you were gonna take on Joe Crowley,
people looked at you like you were crazy.
They did. They did.
-And maybe I was a little bit. -[all laughing]
I mean, you're going up against the Queens Machine, as they call it.
Yeah, yeah. But, you know what?
We meet a machine with a movement
and that is what we have done today.
Well, go ahead and celebrate with your supporters.
-Eighty-two percent of vote! -Yes!
Oh, my God!
Congratulations!
God, thank you!
[man] Alexandria the Great!
[Corbit] Do you want any calls with senators and such that keep calling?
The ones that didn't endorse you along the way?
Or you wanna talk to them tomorrow? It's up to you, obviously.
-Let's talk tomorrow. -Okay.
All right.
It's my first time meeting you. I live in the Bronx--
-[man] I love you! -Oh, thank you!
[Alexandria] When I was a little girl,
my Dad wanted to go on a road trip with his buddies.
I wanted to go so badly, and I begged and I begged,
and he relented.
And so...
it was like four grown men and a five-year-old girl
went on this road trip from New York.
We stopped... We stopped here.
And it was a really beautiful day,
and he leaned down next to me, and he--
he pointed at the Washington Monument,
and he pointed at the Reflecting Pool,
and he pointed at everything, and he said,
he said, "You know,
this all belongs to us."
He said, "This is our government. It belongs to us.
So all of this stuff is yours."
The last thing my Dad ever told me was to make him proud.
And I finally think I did. [laughs] I hope.

Every time it's "just a bit longer."
You've been working here three years.
Yeah, but we haven't been paid for three months!
Those three years mean nothing, we've forgotten them!
We want our three months' pay!
We want our three months!
Don't talk to him on the phone.
Make him give us our money!
That's enough!
Earlier, on the site,
I told you we were going to pay you today.
But we've just heard Mr. N'Diaye is away on business
and hasn't left the money.
We don't want to hear that.
Put that phone down and talk to us!
Cheikh, I'm talking to you.
I don't want a cozy chat. We're here for our money!
I'm talking to you as their leader.
Talk to everyone.
This concerns everyone.
There are four of us.
In this office we're working, just like you.
Do you understand?
What's happening here isn't our fault.
That may surprise you, but not me.
We've gone three months without pay. Four now!
You know what? Keep the money.
But remember that we have families.
I know.
He's right.
Our fathers, mothers and brothers depend on us.
They're the reason we work.
I'm so in debt that I wait till 8:00 or 9:00...
I wait for it to get dark before I go home.
That's not right.
That money is our due.
Souleiman!
Souleiman!
Take the dress.
Ada, you're still seeing that guy?
Take the dress and go.
You're just watching the ocean.
You're not even looking at me.
You're so beautiful.
Even more so today.
Don't make fun of me.
It's true!
You're even more beautiful.
Because I haven't seen you for three days?
Yes, maybe.
You're too beautiful.
I swear.
You're a joker.
Me?
Too bad if you don't believe me.
Wait...
What's wrong?
I heard footsteps.
Footsteps, here?
It's nothing.
There's no one.
I heard someone.
What are you doing here? Who are you?
-What are you doing? -Who are you?
Get outta here!
Hey, calm down.
Don't talk to us like that.
Don't argue! Out!
This isn't a whorehouse!
What did you say?
Get outta here!
Lucky for you...
-Leave him, Souleiman, let's go. -Get outta here!
What's so funny?
Did that guy annoy you that much?
Anyone would get annoyed.
Here's your bag. I'm going.
-Is that why you're laughing? -Yes, that's why.
Okay.
I'm going. It's late.
-Why so soon? -I have to go.
You don't do anything at home.
I have to go.
Wait a bit.
I have to go. It's late.
It'll be night soon. I'll see you later.
Tonight?
What's wrong?
I wanted to give you that.
It's really nice. Thanks.
-I'm going. -You're the loveliest.
Why in such a hurry? I wanted to tell you...
Tell me what? I have to get back. Tell me later.
Come here.
Kiss me again.
Wait till tonight.
Wait till tonight!
I'm going.
What is it?
Nothing.
-Come for your bag? -Yes.
Come here.
Take your bag. There it is.
Mariama.
Why the long face?
Did you lose your virginity on the way?
What did you do?
Nothing, we just walked.
Ada.
You know you're marrying Omar in ten days?
Before God.
But I love Souleiman.
Don't make me laugh!
You know what he wants?
To sleep with you, then he'll dump you!
Forget it, Mariama.
Ada, we've been friends since we were little.
It's my duty to tell you the truth.
Hanging out with those sluts has changed you.
Nonsense!
Keep this between us.
No one must know.
That's all I'm asking.
But... don't you get it?
God is testing you.
He put Souleiman in your path
to test your commitment to Omar.
It's obvious.
You must be blind not to see that!
Mariama, it's okay, I've got it.
But can we keep this between us?
Okay, then.
But you're asking a lot.
You're crazy!
Go on!
Have you called Omar?
No credits left.
Call him before he catches his plane.
Okay.
Call him, okay?
Grandma...
are you okay?
Beep Omar so he'll call you back.
Let's see the dress.
Hello.
May God protect us.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Okay. Have a nice trip.
Is that how you talk to Omar, your husband-to-be?
You shouldn't talk like that to your husband.
How should I talk to him?
You speak sweetly to a man.
"Darling," "my love,"
"I miss you"...
-"Sweetie." -Right.
That's good.
Otherwise, he'll take a second wife before you're pregnant.
Get it?
Do you know how many other women would love to be in your place?
Hold on to that place. Times are tough!
What did you expect?
Ada, the boys have gone.
What?
Out to sea.
Ada.
They went in a boat. Souleiman, Cheikh, all of them.
Abdou, my little brother?
But Abdou doesn't have a clue about the sea!
You know he can't swim!
No, no!
I don't believe it!
It's too late. They've already gone.
Please calm down.
Souleiman.
What also worries me
is that the club could go bust because of this.
No. Once the girls hear from the boys,
they'll be back here to dance.
Girls come here for the boys,
not to dance alone in front of the mirror.
Let's pray they get to Spain safe and sound.
Eat something, Ada.
Eat something or you'll get sick.
Leave me alone.
You have to get a grip.
Don't lose it now.
Ada.
Aren't you listening?
Get up!
Get up.
Ada, are you okay?
I'm okay.
-You're all right? -Yes.
Where's your phone? I couldn't reach you.
I was sleeping.
Why don't you come in through the door?
Can't we stand where we like?
Don't start! Ada, come on, let's go for a walk.
I don't feel like it.
Come on, we'll get some sea air. We won't go far.
No, it's okay.
Please.
Some old local fishermen
come back from fishing
with such a full net
that everyone follows them to see what they've caught.
People rush forward, shouting that they've caught a huge fish.
Children and the whole neighborhood come for a look.
But as they approach the net,
it's not a fish they see there,
but Souleiman's lifeless body.
Ada, come here!
Ada, come here! What are you doing?
I wasn't sure about the color.
Thanks.
You'll see, it'll change your life.
Do you like it?
Yes.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
You haven't eaten.
I'm not hungry.
We're very happy on this great day.
And we praise the Lord
because it's the day every parent wants.
Since Omar's birth,
his mother and I have hoped
to attend his wedding.
Ada, welcome.
This is now your home.
If you had had a brother,
he would never have been
as welcome as you are in this house.
Only a woman in her nuptial veil.
The beauty of a woman
comes through marriage.
It is the will of God.
And it's part of our tradition.
Such is the ritual of marriage, which is a divine blessing.
So let us praise the Lord.
I thank you all.
Imam, let us pray together.
Look at this room!
It's gorgeous!
It's really pretty.
May God protect you.
Ada, congratulations!
Thank you.
Ada, your bedroom is awesome!
I can't believe it.
You'd think that...
I don't know what to say.
All right, Fanta...
No, but have you seen this room?
I'm never leaving here.
Omar can marry me, too.
I've been seduced by the bedroom!
Everything is new.
Ada, let's take a photo.
Leave me out of it.
-Come on! -I don't want to.
-Ada, come on. -Leave me alone.
Ada, come on!
Don't keep nagging.
You show-off!
All right.
-Like this. -Look.
One last pose.
You're really showing off.
You got the jackpot here.
The house is amazing.
We'll post this one.
Ada, just one.
Didn't you hear me?
One more.
Tell Omar I want to be his second wife.
She doesn't know her worth.
Those girls she hangs around with...
Sluts!
Ada, I'm talking to you.
Ada, why are you doing this to yourself?
Look at me. If you can't do this, let's just leave.
When I advised you to marry Omar,
it was so that you'd enjoy it. Not for this.
It was for your happiness.
So you'd be at peace.
In your own interest.
But look at you...
Come on, let's go if you can't do it.
Are you crazy?
You love money more than anything and you're telling her to leave?
To go where? Have you seen this beautiful house?
You witch! It's you telling her that?
You're crazy! Don't listen to her, she's full of shit.
Fanta, if it was me,
I'd gobble up his cash without any scruples.
Let her do the same, then.
Have you seen her? She can't do it.
Where are you going, Ada?
I'll come with you.
But you should understand one thing.
Out there is one big struggle.
You'll have no father or mother.
It'll just be you, all on your own.
If you'd rather face that reality
than stay in this house of happiness,
then let's leave.
Don't tell me that Souleiman--
Fanta!
Just look at her and think.
I'll never love Omar.
Who says you have to?
You have everything here.
Fanta, shut up a minute.
Look at her, if she's your friend.
Omar is only here three months a year, the rest of the time in Italy.
You're not thinking. He'll hardly be here.
-We'll have the house to ourselves! -Shut up!
Ada, I have something to tell you.
Ada, come on.
Not now.
She has something to say.
-What? -You're not coming?
I've just seen Souleiman.
He ran away.
Souleiman? What?
-I saw him. -Why are you lying, Mariama?
We saw him.
-Where? -Ada, calm down.
You witch, stop lying!
I'm not talking to you.
Did you hear that?
Fire, fire!
You'll have to make a statement.
It's a formality, but it's important.
Just a second.
-Issa. -Commissaire.
Are you okay?
-Fine. -Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Because yesterday you collapsed and...
No, it was nothing, I was just feeling faint.
Have you seen a doctor?
I will, Commissaire, but everything is fine.
Are you sure?
Inspector Issa Diop.
Our young star.
He'll be investigating.
Mr. Niang, the owner of the property.
Pierre will give you the file.
Give it to Issa.
The witnesses all say pretty much the same thing.
Mr. Niang.
Are you going? I'll see you out.
Thank you.
Guys...
Feeling better, Inspector?
Yes, I'm fine.
Gloves!
No breaking and entering?
No, nothing was forced.
It's weird, nothing sparked the fire.
Nothing sparked it?
The mattress just spontaneously combusted?
So the firemen said.
Hello, Madam. Are you Souleiman Fall's mother?
Police.
Is that him?
What's happened to my son?
-Where is Souleiman? -He went to sea a week ago.
He was seen last night at about 10:00.
Where's his room?
My son? Where was he seen?
Where's his room?
Who saw my son? That's impossible.
He went to sea.
Tell me where he was seen!
Who saw my son?
-Sir... -Madam.
Listen.
No, no... Wait!
Calm down!
He's wanted on a serious matter. Let me do my job.
Sir, you can't search through my house like this!
Madam, let go of me. Where is his room?
Where is Souleiman's room?
Look at me.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Where is Souleiman Fall?
I don't know where he is.
Really?
But you know him, don't you?
Slightly.
Only slightly?
Look at me.
Do you know where you are?
Yes.
Where?
At the police station.
Do you know why?
No.
Souleiman...
is wanted
for arson.
And you're helping him.
That's a serious matter.
I don't understand.
-You don't understand? -No.
You don't know what he did?
I don't know what's going on.
You know what you did?
You were his accomplice
in setting fire to your wedding bed.
That's impossible.
Really?
Souleiman went to sea. He couldn't have started a fire.
He went with the others in a boat.
A week ago. He's either at sea or in Spain now.
You expect me to believe that?
You're lying!
No.
Out of you two, I believe Mariama.
She wasn't the only one to see him.
Why do you believe Mariama?
I'm telling you the truth.
Youssef!
How many times have I told you about the aircon?
I want it fixed by tomorrow!
Where's Souleiman?
I'm telling you the truth. I don't know where he is.
He went in a boat.
Stay here.
Inspector.
Are you okay?
Send Ada Niang home. We'll carry on tomorrow.
Who's that?
Who's calling you?
-Give me your phone! -No, it's mine!
Give it here!
Here! If you'd brought her up right, we wouldn't be in this situation!
Dad, give it back. It's no one.
These girls were badly brought up. It's your fault!
They must have had good reason to question you.
If you're involved in this, you'll have me to answer to.
Fanta, drink this.
It's sugar.
Fanta, what's going on?
You're freezing.
What happened to you?
I don't know.
Where does it hurt? Tell me.
It looks a lot worse than it is.
She just fainted.
When Mariama wakes up,
give her two pills.
Then two tomorrow after her breakfast.
Oh, God!
Who are you? What are you doing here?
-Well? -Where's our money?
-How did you get in? -Who cares? We're in now.
Laye...
what's going on here?
Who are they?
He knows.
Yes, he does.
What the hell is this? Who are you?
We'll refresh your memory.
Building 13.
The tower site.
Give us our money!
Don't fuck with me!
You know what? Get outta here!
Our money.
Yes.
The 32 million that you owe us.
Four months' wages.
I'm calling the police. You hear me?
Calm down, I'll sort this out.
Here's what we'll do.
I'm asking you to leave my property.
Understand? Don't make me lose my temper.
There's no need for that.
We've come to warn you.
We'll be back. Thirty-two million, our wages.
Our money.
Give us our money!
Mum...
Mum!
We're going to the clinic.
Omar's parents want you to take a virginity test.
A test?
You leave us no choice.
Get up.
I'm waiting.
Can I have my phone back?
We'll see.
I'll wait outside.
Clench your fist.
Congratulations, Madam. Your daughter is a virgin.
-Thank you. -No problem.
Give me back my phone.
Don't look at me like I took you to the devil.
My phone! You got what you wanted.
Your father wanted this, not me.
Ada, come here! Where are you going?
Where are you going?
-No, wait! -It's all right, let me go.
The marabout said
that a spirit got in through my belly button
because I don't dress correctly.
The marabout is talking crap.
Something took hold of me last night.
Are you serious?
You've gone totally crazy.
Don't believe me, then, I don't care.
Hello, Ada?
I've called you four times!
What's up with you? I'm at Fanta's.
What's the matter with you lot?
We have to talk. Come to the fast-food place.
Not on the phone. Come now.
Look how gorgeous you are on that photo.
There were no spirits then!
You shouldn't joke about it.
Just wait till it happens to you.
Me? The spirits are scared of me!
Dior, swear you won't tell anyone.
Don't tell me you're possessed by a spirit!
Never mind. Tell me.
Swear.
Swear, for real!
What do you want?
Nothing for me.
A coffee.
Excuse me.
An espresso, please.
-What is it? -Swear.
Swear to keep it to yourself.
I swear. Now you've got me worried.
Souleiman is here.
What?
Look at his message.
TONIGHT 3AM AT DIOR'S SOULEIMAN
Seriously?
What the hell is this?
What do you mean?
Ada, it's the police!
The police? I've done nothing wrong.
Think about it.
They want to get you.
-Me? -To trap you.
I'll call to check.
Don't bother. It's Souleiman, I can feel it.
Dior...
Hello.
Who's that?
You texted me last night. Who are you?
I helped out a guy who wanted to send a message.
What did he look like?
A young guy. I don't know, he looked blind.
Blind? Are you messing with me?
Stop being paranoid. I'm going.
-Ada, no... -Give me your keys.
It's a trap.
I'm a big girl. Your keys!
It's a trap.
Dior, I'm a big girl.
Your keys!
Ada, you can't be serious.
What would I do without you?
Mrs. Niang.
-What's going on? -Dior, leave us.
Move along.
Let me talk to her.
Leave us.
-I'm not done with you. -Don't you get it?
I don't know where Souleiman is. You can't follow me like this!
You don't know the law.
Talk or you'll make things worse for yourself.
-What do you want? -Tell me where Souleiman is.
I've already told you.
Souleiman went to sea.
No, he started the fire.
Look at me. Talk or I'll lock you up.
You really want to know?
It's true, Souleiman was more than a friend.
That's no revelation.
Now leave me alone.
Where are you going? Let's go.
Leave me alone!
-Let me out! -Shut up!
Let me out! I haven't done anything!
Tell me what I've done!
Don't make me come over there.
I haven't done anything.
What have I done?
Yes, the boat comes from Kafountine,
in Casamance.
Anyway...
The survivors said something that might interest you.
You know there was a storm a few days ago.
Hello?
They managed to stay afloat. They're fishermen, they're used to it.
But the next day, they ran into an overturned boat.
No sign of life anywhere near.
The boat might have been drifting for a while.
It was broken in half.
The chances of finding survivors are bleak.
Hello?
I'll call you back if anything comes up.
Bye, good luck.
Did you lock up the girl who's shouting?
Yes, I want her to talk.
What's wrong with you?
Her husband's here. Let her go.
Ask me first next time!
I couldn't reach you last night. Why?
I felt ill again.
Have you seen a doctor?
Yes, it's nothing serious.
If it's nothing, then be reachable 24/7.
Right.
Some girls got into Mr. N'Diaye's place, asking for money.
-Girls? -About ten of them.
Put a patrol there from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Got it?
I don't want to hear any more about this.
Were the girls there about the unpaid wages?
What unpaid wages? That's not our problem.
They broke in, that's all.
Sort it out. I want it to stop.
Mr. N'Diaye has done a lot for us.
Now let the girl go.
My phone. And my bag.
Is this it?
What is it?
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Did they do something to you?
-No, nothing. -So come on, let's go.
What's the problem?
I'm not coming with you.
Are you mad? Did you bang your head?
Stop it, come on.
Leave me alone, Omar.
I'm not coming with you.
What's going on? What are you waiting for?
What is this bullshit?
What's got into you? Get in, I don't have time for this.
Let me go!
Why are you shouting?
-I'll shout if I want. -I'm your husband.
I'm not your wife!
What?
What? We just got married and you're not my wife?
I don't love you.
Let go of me!
She's gone mad!
Where are you going?
Have you gone mad?
You know what? Piss off!
You wouldn't give me a hard-on, anyway!
She's mad.
I want to sell my phone.
iPhone.
Two hundred thousand.
I'll give you 150,000.
No, 200,000.
Is it yours?
Yes, it was a present.
-I'll give you 150,000. -200,000.
-Is that your last word? -Yes.
Do you want a replacement?
That one.
Let's discuss the price, then.
As soon as she wakes up,
Mariama must plunge verses of the Quran
into a bowl of clean water,
and then pour the holy water over her head.
That will instantly drive away the spirits.
Then, if your daughter behaves like a good Muslim,
says her prayers five times a day and wears the veil,
there's no reason
for the spirits to come back to torment her.
God bless us all.
Thank you.
Thanks again. Have a pleasant evening.
Mariama?
Watch carefully. You see this bit?
You put it here,
then turn it
and pull.
The other end is for opening soft drinks and beer.
Vodka and liqueurs go in the small glasses.
I hope you're getting this.
Soft-drink glass, wine glass, spirit glass.
-Got it? -Yes.
You have to remember it all.
How can you still believe it's Souleiman?
You shouldn't go.
Where's the money?
We'll wait for you tomorrow at 3:00 a.m. in the cemetery.
If you don't have the money then,
we'll burn your tower down.
Where have you come from?
I'm talking to you!
Souleiman?
Souleiman, is that you?
Ada...
Souleiman, it's the police! Run!
Ada.
Ada... it's me.
It's me, Souleiman.
Dior!
-I saw... -Ada.
-Tell me! -The boys are back.
What?
Ada, wait!
Fanta?
Ada.
Souleiman told me about you in the boat.
You know...
in your final moments,
you unburden your heart.
He told me...
that he regretted so much
not having said goodbye to you.
He couldn't.
None of us could.
Ada.
Souleiman...
You were the love of his life.
He wanted to come back for you.
And be yours.
It was about 5:00 a.m.
It was quiet in the boat.
As the sun was rising,
the guys were quiet.
I thought we were nearly there
because I could see a mountain in the distance.
I thought we'd reached Spain
and we'd finally be able to call you all.
I shouted for joy.
Then it all happened so quickly.
A strong wind whipped up the sea.
We were terrified
by the power of the waves.
Some were shivering with fear.
Others were sobbing with distress.
What I'd thought was a mountain
was a wave.
Immense.
It lifted up our boat, which collapsed like a building.
We were cast into the depths.
Chief!
The girl has gone.
MISSED CALLS COMMISSAIRE SY
You know what happened last night? Another fire.
A fire is raging and you're sleeping?
At Mr. N'Diaye's. Again, nothing sparked it.
Commissaire, let me do the investigation.
Please.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Twenty.
Twenty-two.
Twenty-four.
Twenty-six.
Twenty-eight.
Thirty.
Let me go. You have the money.
You're going nowhere.
It's your fault we're dead. Never forget.
I'm sorry.
"I'm sorry."
You have your money.
Thirty-two million.
It's all there.
Let me go.
Not yet.
Dig our graves first.
Look, he doesn't even know how to dig.
That's real work!
Dig till your hands burn.
Faster!
Every time...
you look at the top of the tower,
you'll think of our unburied bodies
at the bottom of the ocean.
I knew you'd be back.
It could only be you.
I'll always taste
the salt of your body in the sweat of mine.
How beautiful you are.
I saw you in the enormous wave which consumed us.
All I saw was your eyes and your tears.
I felt your weeping dragging me to the shore.
Your eyes never left me.
They were there, within me.
Pouring their light into the depths.
Fanta?
Commissaire.
The case is closed.
Come on, girl!
Some memories are omens.
Last night will stay with me,
to remind me who I am...
and show me who I will become.
Ada, to whom the future belongs.
I'm Stacy, that baker from Chicago,
who flew to Belgravia to enter a baking contest,
but then switched places with Margaret, the Duchess of Montenaro,
who looks just like me.
I'm guessing you remember I married Prince Edward,
and you probably remember that Margaret fell in love with my best friend Kevin.
Cutest couple ever, right?
But what you don't know, is that since all of that happened,
the King of Montenaro died,
and Margaret is now in line for the throne,
which has royally messed up everything in the romance department.
I've been pretty busy, but take it from me,
happily ever after is never easy.
-[chuckles] Especially for a princess. -[crowd clamoring]
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the moment we've all been waiting for!
The final results of Belgravia's 59th Annual International Baking Competition!
And here to announce the winner is head judge and past champion,
Stacy De Novo Wyndham, Princess of Belgravia!
[in American accent] Thank you.
Thank you.
We are so pleased
that these incredible bakers have come from all over the world this Christmas.
Christmas is about giving...
[in distance] ...and this year's contestants have given us creativity, excellence and artistry.
So without further ado,
our first prize winner is someone I competed against two years ago.
This year he has created a cake that is very special to me.
The first time I kissed my husband Prince Edward was under the mistletoe.
Everyone, give it up for Zach Brachmann from Munich, Germany
and his mistletoe masterpiece.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
You were positively charming today, darling.
All I did was hand out some ribbons.
I'm just sorry I didn't get to see the whole ceremony.
Yeah, parliament ran over, yet again.
It's all good.
Well, I don't know if it is,
with my taking on more of the king's responsibilities
and you running the royal charities and your bake shop, there…
There hasn't been much time for the two of us.
Well, what we do is important.
We're important too. I don't want to lose that.
Well, the good news is we'll be in Montenaro by the end of the week.
-Hmm. -We'll have plenty of time together.
Christmas in Montenaro sounds absolutely enchanting.
It does.
-But I'm worried about Margaret. -Why?
Well, have you seen this?
[Edward] "Is the Duchess ready to rule?"
And this?
Margaret never expected to be queen.
Remember how much she hated the spotlight?
Well, with her coronation televised on Christmas Day,
she's going to have to get used to it pretty quickly.
She just sounded so sad when I called her.
King Dennis died
-and Prince Howard abdicated so… -Yeah.
…like it or not, she's next in the line of succession.
Remind me, why are we talking about Margaret again right now?
Because I can't sleep when I'm worried.
Well, there are…
other things we might do to relieve your anxiety
besides talking about Lady Margaret.
To tell you the truth. I think she's not over Kevin.
I mean, the breakup must have been incredibly hard for both of them.
-We could light a fire. -She was about to move to Chicago.
-We could open a bottle of wine? -They were almost engaged.
We could put on some music.
Did you know Kevin was shopping for a ring?
-Stacy! -What?
They went their separate ways. People do it all the time.
I know. It's just…
Olivia texts me every single day.
She says that her dad's miserable without Margaret.
He turned down the invitation to the coronation.
-Apparently, he doesn't want to see her. -Well, men never know what they want.
I know what I want.
I have a great idea.
Why don't we take a teeny tiny little detour to Chicago
on our way to Montenaro?
Oh, darling. I wish I could get away sooner. I really do.
But… Unless you want to go to Chicago without me…
Ooh! Yay! I'm gonna pack and catch the first flight out in the morning.
♪ Feelin' naughty and nice ♪ ♪ Either way it feels right When you're sitting next to me ♪
[woman] Thanks so much. Merry Christmas. [girl] Thanks and Merry Christmas.
A dozen Christmas cookies, please!
Stacy?
[Stacy chuckles] Hi!
-I missed you! -I missed you.
Stacy! What are you doing here?
I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd check on my business partner.
-I love the new location, by the way. -Thanks. Where's Edward?
He's meeting me in London on our way to Montenaro.
-Ooh. -Well, you look fantastic.
Thanks, and you look…
comfortable.
Yeah, it's all good.
He hasn't gone on a date since the breakup with you-know-who.
I have a business to run. Remember?
[Stacy] Come on, Kev. Life isn't about working all the time.
I know, which is why we're adopting another cat for Christmas.
Another cat?
Yeah. You can never have too many cats.
We need to talk.
How about you go and wipe down one of those tables over there?
So, what's up?
Well, you're wearing sweatpants, you won't date and you're collecting cats.
And?
Two years ago, you handed me an invitation that changed my life.
It's time for me to return the favor.
Stace, Margaret and I called it quits six months ago.
Yeah, which is probably the dumbest thing you've ever done in your life.
We just didn't want the same things anymore.
Besides, I mean, she's moved on. I've moved on.
-Really? -Yeah.
'Cause you don't look like you've moved on.
I've already sent the RSVP.
[clears throat] About that RSVP…
It kind of never made it to the mailbox.
Liv…
Kevin, go to the coronation as her friend.
[sighs] I don't know.
Inheriting the throne is huge.
Margaret needs us to be there for her, all of us.
[Olivia] Please, Daddy.
She's my friend too.
-Fine. -[Olivia and Stacy giggle]
Hey! Call the cat sitter.
Maybe before we leave, you should get, like, a haircut and a real pair of pants.
What's wrong with these?
Thank you, Frank.
[Margaret] Stacy!
[in British accent] I'm so happy you're here.
Me too.
I was afraid you'd be too busy to manage it.
-Oh, nonsense. -There's no way we'd miss your coronation.
Which is exactly what I told her.
Mrs. Donatelli, you look amazing.
Oh, thank you. And you look positively radiant, Your Royal Highness.
Well, Stacy was born to be a princess.
It feels like ages since I saw you.
Well, we're here now and, uh, we brought you a little surprise.
-Olivia! -Margaret!
Look at you! Oh!
She's grown up since you last saw her.
Indeed she has.
When we didn't receive your RSVP, we weren't sure you were coming.
I hope it's okay that we're here…
as friends.
Of course, it is. As friends.
Can we see your palace?
-[laughs] -[Margaret] Right this way.
Hello!
[Stacy] Margaret, why is everything covered?
I haven't quite settled in yet.
Isn't there a Christmas Ball coming up?
There is, but I stopped the staff from decorating the residence.
Honestly, I was thinking of canceling the festivities…
-the concert, the ball, all of it. -Why?
It doesn't seem right.
The country is still mourning the loss of their king.
-It's also celebrating its new queen. -Yeah!
The people are looking to you as their new ruler, Lady Margaret.
You're their hope for the future.
Well, the problem is I don't know if I'll ever feel at home here.
Well, I don't know.
A palace can feel quite cozy when you share it with people you love.
Well, I suppose it can.
If you ask me, this place is in need of some serious Christmas cheer.
You really wouldn't mind lending a hand?
Let's deck these halls.
-Gorgeous! -Dad!
[gasps] Wow!
[Kevin] Watch your step now! Comin' in hot!
-You got it? -[Stacy] Yep.
Yeah.
-[Olivia] Look at that tree. -Hey.
[Margaret] This is absolutely wonderful.
Only one thing missing.
-What's that? -Hot chocolate?
Oh. Coming right up, but I'll need a helper.
I was going to play Twister with Edward and Stacy.
Right, guys?
Yes, Christmas would not be the same without Twister.
-Right. -Maybe Margaret can help?
I suppose I could give it a whirl.
So… where is the kitchen?
This way.
-Good thinking. -Thank you!
Yes!
Okay. We need sugar, powdered cocoa, milk and vanilla.
All right.
You've, uh... never been in here before, have you?
Of course I have.
Let's check the refrigerator.
Dear me, it's empty.
Okay, good one.
[Margaret] This shouldn't be too hard.
-Ah. The sugar's behind the flour. -[Kevin] I'll get it.
-It's quite all right. -It'll be easier if I get it.
I told you-- [gasps]
-Not funny. -No.
You want funny? I can give you funny.
-No! -No.
[Antonio] What in the world is going on here? Antonio!
I wasn't expecting you until tomorrow morning.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
-Not in the least. -[Antonio] There's just so much to review.
I thought we should get a jump on things over a cup of tea.
Of course.
Kevin Richards.
Forgive me. This is Antonio Rossi, my Chief of Staff.
-I'd shake your hand, but-- -No worries.
-My pleasure. -Go.
I got it.
-You're sure? -Yeah.
Well, all right.
Now, about the concert on Christmas Eve,
it would mean so much to everyone if you attended,
especially to the children.
All right, I'll go.
As long as there are no speeches.
No speeches. I promise.
Just a brief reception after and…
all you have to do is smile and shake some hands.
Did you confirm my meeting with the Treasury Secretary?
He'll be here at 10:00 tomorrow morning.
And I'll be there as well.
Tony…
did you always attend cabinet meetings with the king?
Not always.
But I thought you could use a little guidance.
Maybe I overstepped.
Not at all.
But I have to learn to do this on my own.
I have been training for the past six months.
I just want you to know I'm here for you, whatever you need,
whenever you need me.
That's very sweet.
I'm just bringing a few extra things for the-- for the mantle.
Like tinsel.
You can never have enough tinsel!
At least that's what my nana used to say.
She was a big fan. Really big.
-Of tinsel? -[Stacy] Yeah!
The biggest.
She used it for everything.
You know, once she knitted me a tinsel sweater.
Anyways, don't mind me. I'm just gonna…
Come in.
Hey, um...
can I borrow some hairspray?
I thought you don't do hairspray.
Oh, I don't. Just on special occasions.
And will you be wearing your nana's tinsel sweater to the ball this evening?
I forgot to pack it.
Why don't you tell me why you're really here?
What's the deal with you and Antonio?
I've known Antonio forever.
We went to school together.
And now he works for you?
He served the late king for the last three years.
Seemed prudent to keep him in place.
Why do you ask?
No reason. I just…
saw the two of you in the dining room, and you looked kinda…
cozy.
Tony's been an enormous help to me.
And are you two a thing?
We've had a few business dinners.
That's all.
But he's very dear.
And very handsome.
You know, Kevin has been looking pretty hot these days.
Yes, he has.
But you know things didn't work out between us
and I can't spend my life wishing things had turned out differently.
Maybe it's time for a second chance?
It's late.
We'd better be getting ready.
-The ball starts in two hours. -Yeah, okay.
Stacy…
did Kevin say anything?
About what?
About, well, his feelings for me?
You should ask for yourself.
Has anyone ever told you you were born to wear a tuxedo?
-You... -Oh. ...every time I wear a tuxedo. -Hmm? -Hmm.
I hate to interrupt the smooch fest, but…
ta-da!
-That is one serious party dress! -Right? And look at my dad.
-Ta-da! -You'd better.
Her Royal Highness, Lady Margaret Delacourt.
-[man] Your Highness. -[woman] Your Highness
Now's your moment.
-My moment for what? -Ask her to dance.
-Go. Kevin! -[Kevin] Uh...
I must say you are the most beautiful monarch in the history of Montenaro.
I've heard that our first queen, Judith the Brave, rivaled Helen of Troy.
Yeah, but her dance moves really sucked, though.
Let's show them how it's done.
All right. If you'll excuse me.
Here we go.
I'm really happy you decided to be a part of all this.
Me too.
To tell you the truth, I…
wasn't sure we could still be friends.
Yeah, things got complicated after the whole queen thing happened.
I suppose they did.
Things used to be so spontaneous for us.
Well, here's an idea. Why don't we go back to spontaneous?
How?
Well, if you have time tomorrow, maybe we can go for a drive.
As friends?
Sure, as friends.
Sounds like a lovely idea.
What could possibly come between two people who look at each other like that?
[in British accent] Yo, let's get this party started, shall we?
Excuse you.
Announce me.
-I-- -Do the thing. [scoffs] Never mind.
[coos] Maggie Moo!
Here we go.
-Must we really do this? -Pics or it didn't happen.
Say fromage!
Double chin! That's a delete.
But no worries, it happens. Not to me, but it happens.
Fiona, I'm so… elated you could make it.
Oh, you certainly have learned how to throw a party. So proud of you.
Proceeds from tonight's event go to one of the royal charities.
There's an orphanage in particular need, St. Michael's.
We're running a toy drive.
Of course you are, you cute little Mother Teresa.
How long are you in town for?
Until your big day.
And then we jet off to Capri for the New Year's,
but I fully intend to spend as much time as possible with my favorite little cuzzy.
[chuckles] Lucky me.
Well, hello, tuxedo man.
Me?
This is my friend Kevin,
his daughter Olivia, Princess Stacy and Prince Edward of Belgravia.
Everyone, this is my cousin Fiona Pembroke.
Pembroke as in Lord Percival Pembroke?
-The one who died of a peanut allergy? -[Margaret] Her father, my uncle.
Oh my God,
you're the one who switched places with my cuzzy!
[chuckles] That's me.
You two seriously look like twins! Spoopy!
It means spooky.
Have you two done the switch thing since you tied the knot with his Royal Hotness?
-[Edward chuckles] -Fiona, please!
Minions, I need more champagne.
[scoffs] Reggie, Mindy!
Oh yeah, gorgeous.
Oh, it's such a pain to find good help these days.
You're yummy.
Wow!
I mean, I can see the family resemblance.
You can't miss it.
But is she really related to you?
Fiona's always been a free spirit.
She inherited quite the fortune when my uncle died.
Guessing there isn't much of it left.
[Margaret] There isn't.
Though she still has the old Pembroke Estate in the country.
She keeps Reggie and Mindy on staff, but I've no idea how she pays them.
Your Highness, I apologize for disturbing you.
The Prime Minister is asking for you.
Of course.
I have a meeting with the Treasury tomorrow morning.
Shall we say two o'clock?
You got it.
[men] Cheers.
-[man] Are you having a good time? -[woman 1] Yes, I am.
Oh, stop it!
[woman 2] So sweet.
Is that all of it?
The place was dripping with money.
[gasps] How did you…
-[groans] Never mind. And you? -Hmm.
Explain to me how this is going to pay for a summer in Capri.
-It's double ply. -And your point is?
It's double ply!
I'm so tired of this!
If you're tired, Mindy, then come up with something better.
I can't be the looks and brains of this operation.
I thought I was the looks!
And that's why you're not the brains.
Why can't you be the one who gets to be queen instead of your stupid cousin?
Then we'd be set for life.
Just stop talking.
Leave me.
How was the Treasury meeting?
I've spent the last several months
analyzing the impact of tariffs on the trade deficit.
No one's even asked for my opinion.
They will.
How do you know?
Because I know you.
Margaret…
I've been thinking, and, um…
[Antonio] There you are.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
[Margaret] Is everything all right?
I hate to bother you… again.
But… there's an urgent matter requiring your immediate attention.
We'll be back in an hour.
It really can't wait.
I'm so sorry.
Hey. Do what you have to.
I thought there was something urgent.
There is, but it's not what you think.
I knew if I didn't do this now, I'd lose my nerve.
What's this all about?
Margaret, I'd be lying…
if I told you I served you only out of a sense of duty.
You're not just about to become the Queen of Montenaro,
you've also become the queen of my heart.
Tony.
This is for you.
I was going to give it to you at Christmas,
but… I want you to have it now.
It's beautiful.
We've been friends for a long time now, you and I…
but lately I've been wishing we could be something more.
Oh. I, uh...
I really don't know what to think.
I'm rather confused about everything.
Does…
everything include that friend of yours?
I don't know.
Maybe…
Margaret…
it's all right.
It's such a relief to hear you say that.
You know, we'd make a fantastic couple, you and I.
-Everyone says so. -[laughs]
Just promise me…
you'll at least consider it.
All right.
What was I supposed to say?
I thought you and Antonio weren't a thing.
We're not,
but Tony's been a huge help to me.
Don't you think he's trying just a little too hard?
Tony's always spent a bit too much on things he shouldn't,
but we've known each other since university.
But maybe he's right.
Maybe we could be good for each other.
You and Kevin are good for each other.
There's so much water under the bridge, Stacy.
Kevin and I haven't even begun to talk about what went wrong between us,
and every time we try, we never get a chance to finish our conversation.
I don't know if we ever will.
Well, maybe you need to try harder.
Is love really supposed to take so much effort?
Look, I know it in my heart.
You and Kevin are meant to be.
And I used to know it too,
but maybe all we're meant to be is a happy memory.
I got your message. You wanted to see me?
I did.
Thank you for coming.
-What's up? -This is terribly hard to say,
but here it is.
I'm not sure you're being fair to Lady Margaret.
You want to explain that?
I know the two of you were involved for a time and…
I can tell the relationship was very meaningful.
But, uh…
But what?
Could it be that you're holding her back?
If that's the way she felt, she'd tell me.
Yeah, uh...
Lady Margaret's very confused right now.
I'm certain she doesn't want to hurt your feelings, but, uh…
have you really considered what's best for her?
Let me guess, you're what's best for her?
Look, I know you care deeply for her, Mr. Richards, but…
when affairs of state overwhelm her,
are you really sure you're the one she should turn to?
You're a baker from Chicago,
and I'm certain a very good one,
but… are you truly a consort for a queen?
[Stacy] Come in.
Hey, what's up, kiddo?
[Olivia] We gotta talk.
Now!
About what?
Operation "Get Dad Back Together With Margaret," it's going to crash and burn.
Yeah, tell me about it.
But I have an idea.
You want us to do what?
Switch places again.
You said you needed more time to talk things over with Kevin,
but you can't do that because you're too busy.
So Stacy can be you,
and you and my dad can spend some quality time together.
It's terribly risky.
It was risky the last time and you're the one who thought of it.
Yes, but you're a princess now and I'm about to become queen.
We can't just stop everything and swap lives.
Why not?
With everything that's going on with Tony--
[Stacy] Margaret…
If you know for sure that it's over with Kevin
and you want to get serious with Antonio,
we won't say another word about this.
Do you really think we could pull it off?
Again?
Well, the only thing on your schedule tomorrow is the Christmas concert.
All you have to do is sit and wave to people.
Yeah, and when it's over Mrs. Donatelli will walk you--
I mean, me, through the reception and then it's back to the palace.
That way, you and Kevin have plenty of alone time together.
And then we switch back.
I suppose it could work.
Does that mean you'll do it?
Did you talk this over with Kevin?
Did you talk this over with Margaret?
Yeah, and she's good to go if you are.
[sighs] I don't know.
-Maybe she's better off with Antonio. -[Stacy groans]
He's a nice guy.
-Yeah, well, you're a nicer guy. -Yeah!
Did you tell Edward about this?
The less people who know, the better.
Yeah, I'll fake a cold or something.
Look, it'll only be for a few hours.
Okay, and I'll tell him everything as soon as it's over.
You need to do this, Daddy.
If Margaret's in…
-I'm in. -Yay!
Oh, there you are, darling! Been looking all over for you!
Oh, well, you know me. Always busy!
-Yes. That's what I wanted to talk about. -Can we talk about it later?
I was just on my way to the kitchen to do some Christmas baking.
Well, I was actually hoping we might be able to find a moment
to do something together.
We will. I promise. As soon as I'm done in the kitchen, okay?
Why the change of clothes?
Oh, what, these old things?
I am donating them to the orphanage.
I better get them to Frank. He's coordinating everything.
Didn't I get you that scarf last Christmas?
You did. I love it so much, I got another one to donate to the orphans.
Yeah. I love you. Bye.
♪ Fire's burning gold ♪ ♪ I've got you here to hold ♪
-[audio feedback squealing] -Hey, what did you do that for?
Do I really need to explain?
-[Reggie] Everyone's a critic. -[Fiona] Ever wonder why?
No.
Well, maybe you should.
-Well, maybe I shouldn't. -Maybe you should.
-Maybe I shouldn't. -Maybe you should, mate.
-Maybe I shouldn't. -I think you should.
-I'm not going to-- -Maybe you should both shut up and listen!
Well, if you've got something to say, Fi-Fi, just spit it out.
I figured it out.
Figured what out?
Well, our big score.
I'm listening.
Remember when you said if I were Margaret, we'd be set?
Yeah, but, um… you're not Margaret.
Well, of course I'm not Margaret, Einstein.
But, if Betty Crocker from Belgravia could pull the switch,
why can't I?
I'm not feeling it.
My Ariana Grande phase.
I wouldn't have to do it for long, just long enough to get crowned queen
and transfer a small fortune to an unnumbered bank account in the Caymans.
Oh, I'm starting to feel it!
Then we spend the rest of our lives sipping piña coladas on a beach
in a country that doesn't have an extradition policy.
Yeah, baby!
You're first cousins, so you know the family history, right? Hmm.
You're welcome, and you grew up here with Margaret
before you went to school in the States.
So, we do the hair, we lose the nails and the contouring,
which is the only thing giving her cheekbones.
Excuse you!
And no one's gonna notice the little extra junk in the trunk.
-What are you saying? -Hey, I'm agreeing with you!
Hold on!
We've got a big, big problem here.
Well, spit it out.
Cousin Mags ain't gonna go along with any of this.
Which is why you'll have to grab her and stash her somewhere.
And to do that,
I'm gonna need to know exactly where she's gonna be
and what she's gonna be doing for the next few days.
That shouldn't be terribly difficult to find out.
Maggie! Maggie Moo! It's your cuzzy!
-Oh! So sorry. Didn't see you there. -No worries, Royal Six-Pack.
Can you tell Maggie I've got something for her orphans?
How… generous.
I'd like to deliver it in person.
Well, I'm afraid Lady Margaret's turned in for the evening.
Yes, tomorrow's a busy day.
Huh. What's she so busy with?
The Christmas concert.
Yes, the Montenaro Children's Choir.
There is a reception afterwards if you'd like to catch up with her then.
Hmm. I do love a good reception.
And where's your princess bride?
[Edward] Yes, I was just looking for her, actually.
So, I'm sure you get this all the time,
but it's completely mad how much your wife looks like my Maggie Moo!
It still amazes me.
And is it really true they traded places?
[Edward] It is indeed.
And they met where, at some silly little contest?
A baking contest, over a spilt cup of coffee.
They ran into one another on the way to the powder room.
The powder room? Lol.
Oh, I believe Frank is coordinating the gifts for the orphans.
Well, then I guess this is au revoir!
Ms. Pembroke, what an exquisite surprise.
I have something for you.
-But first-- -Yes?
Have you been naughty or nice?
Well…
Between us, the correct answer is "naughty."
-Naughty. Hmm. -Hmm.
-Meow. -May I help you?
For the orphans.
-Thank you. -Mm.
I know when, I know how... -[car door opens] -...and I know where.
The concert's tomorrow, so we have to hurry.
Call you from the road.
Oh, Olivia! You look festive this morning.
It's Christmas Eve!
So it is. We have a concert to attend.
Um, about that, Stacy says she has a headache. She can't go.
-She was fine ten minutes ago. -It came on really fast.
I should check on her.
She told me she was going back to sleep.
It's probably better if we don't wake her up.
Hmm. Good point.
See you!
You ready?
Ready.
So ready.
-What? -So gross!
Here you go.
[laughs] Perfect.
I love it.
All right. Finishing touches. Rings.
Oh yeah. It feels weird taking it off.
Her subjects adore her.
They love how she smiles. They see you, you're there.
-You're waving. -Why am I waving?
-Because they wave! -No, no, no!
I grew up with her. She doesn't wave all the time.
She stands very erect and she holds her hands like this. I don't know why.
[in British accent] And the earrings.
Walk, swagger, walk, swagger, walk, swagger and pose. It's simple!
[in British accent] Lovely. A bit more like this.
-Yo. -[in American accent] What are you doing?
-What? -I'm not a gangster, just relax.
You enter with confidence!
-Posture. She holds her hands like this. -It's not! It's about service--
[in American accent] What do you think?
Even better than last time.
[in British accent] So, how do we proceed?
I'll escort you to the service entrance
from where Mr. De Luca will drive you to meet Mr. Richards.
Here we go.
[in American accent] I'll wait for you downstairs.
Are you ready?
Hell yeah.
[Edward] Penny for your thoughts.
[in British accent] Edward. How lovely to see you.
Are you going somewhere?
Stacy is under the weather, so I thought I'd take a stroll.
Ah, yes.
A stroll a day keeps the bad weather away.
And you don't want to be under the weather when the weather's bad…
Well, don't let me keep you.
Actually, you're not keeping me at all.
In fact, it's rather fortuitous I ran into you.
Is it?
[sighs] There's something I've been meaning to talk to you about,
something I hope you keep in the strictest confidence.
Do you really think now is the time?
I need your advice about Stacy.
What kind of advice?
Well, to be completely candid…
things have been… different between us these past few months.
It seems as if she's always got something to do or somewhere to be.
Well, I'm sure you're very busy as well.
Yeah, I suppose.
But I daresay that most of what I do is to keep busy while she's otherwise occupied.
I'm honestly worried that somehow I've let her down.
That perhaps married life isn't what she hoped it would be.
Well, that…
That…
That couldn't be true.
Has she said anything to you?
Anything that might make you think she's having second thoughts about us?
Not a peep.
Because nothing is more important to me than her happiness.
Stacy's everything to me.
Your car is ready, Your Grace.
Yes, just one moment, if you please.
Everything will be all right, Edward.
I promise.
[Olivia] Where are you going?
Oh, I thought I'd see how Stacy's feeling.
Don't do that.
Why not?
Because-- because she said she was going to take me Christmas shopping
for my dad's present while he's at the concert,
but now she can't.
-So she said you'd do it. -Don't you want to go to the concert?
Nah, I really want to surprise my dad,
but we better get going before all the good stuff's gone.
Yes, I suppose we could run out and find a little something.
Let's go.
[Stacy in American accent] Here we go again.
[Donatelli] You'll be fine, Your Royal Highness. Come on, deep breath.
Frank.
Thank you.
Welcome to Santa's Magic Village. And we have the whole place to ourselves.
[in British accent] How did you manage it?
Mrs. Donatelli. [laughs]
That woman rocks.
Indeed she does.
Kevin…
I'm so sorry about canceling yesterday.
We're here now. That's all that counts.
All right.
[Kevin] So what do you want to do first?
We can string some popcorn, pet a reindeer, visit the North Pole…
Ooh. I quite like this one. [Santa tie] Ho ho ho!
No, you don't…
Who are you calling?
Olivia, is there some reason you don't want me to speak to Stacy?
No…
I didn't want to say anything, but…
you're being a little bit of a helicopter husband.
Sorry, what?
A helicopter husband.
You know, someone who hovers around and…
doesn't give the other person room to breathe.
Do you really think I… hover?
Right. -[bells jangle] -[door closes]
Perhaps we should have dinner out as well, and do a little shopping for your friends.
I have lots of friends.
Brilliant. [chuckles] Brilliant.
Showtime.
The service entrance is right there in the alley.
We'll need five minutes to get past security
-and then we'll let you in. -I know, I made the plan.
Just stay here till I come and get you.
Okay.
What do you think?
I like her smile.
She hasn't smiled in quite a while.
Funny…
because he told me he had the same problem.
They say love conquers all,
but it's not so straightforward, is it?
No.
It's not.
The truth is…
there's no one else in the world I'd rather be with.
That's not what you said six months ago.
I thought we were going to live the simple life.
You, me, and Olivia, you know, take things easy.
Be spontaneous.
Things were going good until your cousin decided he didn't want to be king.
I know that this whole royal affair isn't what you want.
But it's who I am now.
I can't give it up.
But the truth is I don't want to give it up.
It's become more than just a duty for me.
I love this country.
I love the people.
This is something that I was destined to do.
It's who I am now.
I know.
-And I don't want you to give it up. -You don't?
No.
You're gonna be a great queen.
The thing is…
I just don't want to hold you back.
How could you ever hold me back?
You need someone who's your equal.
Someone who knows the ropes.
Antonio's all that.
I'm not.
Don't you see?
None of that matters.
You're the one I love,
not Tony.
You don't have to be a count or a prince or a king.
You just need to be…
you.
Are you sure about that?
I was heartbroken when you said you just wanted to be friends.
I only said that because you said that.
-[sighs] -[Kevin] Look…
maybe the spontaneous thing to do is
give us another chance.
I do love spontaneous.
Ladies and gentlemen,
our sponsor and patroness, Lady Margaret Delacourt.
Mrs. Donatelli! You're just the person I'm looking for!
I'm afraid now isn't the time, I--
This dreadful man is threatening to post lurid details
about Duchess Margaret and Prince William!
I am terribly sorry, Your Grace.
-You clumsy oaf! -No, it was an accident!
Oh, not to worry. It's just a silly little spill.
If I get you to the ladies' room quickly, I can get that out for you.
Jolly good! Back in a jiff.
-All right. What is this all about? -No, I don't.
-Right in here, Your Ladyship. -Thank you, Mindy. You're an angel.
Well, some say.
[Stacy] I haven't seen Fiona. Is she here?
Surprise!
Now it's my turn to switch.
-[Mindy] Hurry up! -This is as fast as I can go!
Oh, dear. All right.
All right, then. Come on, gently does it. [Stacy in American accent] What are you doing?
[Stacy in American accent] What are you doing? Where are you taking me?
Margaret Delacourt, is it really you?
Who else would it be?
Where is my driver?
Don't you remember me?
Of course I do, you're…
Shannon Earle!
Only now it's Shannon Earle Carlisle.
We went to Oxford together!
Oxford. Dear Oxford green.
Oh, it's Oxford blue.
I'm color blind. Driver!
You were in my Italian class.
Dolce & Gabbana. My car, now. Take me to the palace.
[Stacy] Where am I?
-[Reggie] All right. -[Mindy] Blimey!
[Stacy] What is this place?
[Reggie] Mindy, help me out here, girl.
[Reggie] All right, come on.
Your royal suite, your Highnesty.
[in American accent] I'm telling you, you kidnapped the wrong person.
-People are gonna be looking for me. -[Reggie] Yeah, yeah. All right.
-My husband is going to be looking for me. -[Reggie] Uh-huh. [Stacy] You'll all go to prison!
"Your Highnesty?"
-Oh, shut up, Reggie. -[laughing]
Me? Your Highnesty.
Meow!
Come to Mommy.
-[door opens] -[Margaret] Stacy, I'm back!
-Who is it? -It's me, Margaret.
I had the most enchanting time of my life.
Oh, my…
Kevin is the most wonderful man in the world.
You were absolutely right.
All we needed was a little time together.
I've never been happier in my life.
And I owe it all to you, you darling girl.
Well, you and Olivia.
Oh, Stacy, I'm so glad you talked me into switching places.
Did…
Did I really have to talk you into switching places?
I was honestly terrified we wouldn't be able to pull it off again,
but apparently we did.
Apparently.
I hope the Christmas concert wasn't too much trouble.
I love a good concert.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I need to change for dinner.
I don't want to keep Kevin waiting.
By the way, your accent is much better.
Dinner with Kevin?
Aren't you the least bit concerned about Edward?
What has any of this got to do with Edward?
He is your husband after all.
Don't be silly.
Stacy.
You know how much I treasure our friendship,
but barging in here and going on about how you're planning to cheat on Edward. Well...
I think you better go.
Stacy, the game is over.
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
This isn't funny. It's time to switch back.
I insist you take your leave at once.
You must be joking.
Or would you rather I call the guard and have you thrown out?
That won't be necessary.
We are so screwed!
You're such a drama queen.
We grabbed the wrong Maggie.
This one's got free Wi-Fi and Taco Tuesdays.
Oh, and a cabana boy!
You're not going to need a cabana boy in prison.
So, would you two please stop talking and focus?
All right, Fi-Fi! There's no reason to get testy.
Really, Reggie?
Because I think there is.
I think there's a very big reason.
If your cousin's there, then who've we got in the basement?
Well, the look-alike from Belgravia.
She did say you grabbed the wrong person.
Me?
-So now it's my fault? -Well, it's not mine.
-[Reggie] It's not mine! -[Mindy] Yes, it is.
-[Reggie] I's not! -[Mindy] It is.
-No, it's not. I was following you! -It's 'cause you said--
[grunts] We need a plan.
All right…
You said this was a get-in, get-out job, right?
So?
So all you have to do is get out faster.
Well, no can do. The coronation isn't till tomorrow.
So move it up to tonight.
And how am I supposed to do that?
Hello? You're going to be queen.
You make the rules.
I do, don't I?
But first I've got some dinner plans to cancel.
Darling!
-So glad your headache's better. -There's something I have to tell you.
[Edward] Let me go first.
I need to apologize if I've hovered too much,
you know, like a helicopter, circling about and buzzing all the while.
Why are you speaking with a different accent?
I'm not speaking with an accent. I'm Margaret.
Don't be silly.
Why won't anyone believe me?
-You're serious. -Yeah.
I've never been more serious in my life.
-But Stacy promised me that she'd never-- -It's my fault.
I needed time with Kevin and Stacy was only trying to help.
No one was supposed to know.
If no one's supposed to know, why are you telling me now?
There's been a bit of a snag.
Well, a rather major snag to be precise.
[Frank] Come on now, remember our chat.
-Twenty-five years-- -Come on, happy face.
Mrs. Donatelli? Are you all right?
No.
No, I am most certainly not all right.
The most awful thing has happened.
After 25 years of loyal service, Lady Margaret has…
Well, she's given me the boot.
She says that she doesn't need me anymore,
and she's moved the coronation up to tonight
so that she can spend Christmas with the orphans.
I would never fire you, Mrs. Donatelli,
and I certainly am not moving up my coronation.
Lady Margaret?
-And… he knows? -Yes.
-And you've not switched back yet? -No.
And I can assure you the woman upstairs in my suite is not Princess Stacy,
unless she's gone completely off her trolley.
Let me see if I follow this, so…
if the two of you haven't switched back
and this is Lady Margaret,
and if Lady Margaret upstairs isn't Stacy,
who's upstairs and where's my wife?
Off with their heads.
Who--
-Who is it? -It's Kevin.
Come in.
I know, I'm kind of early but…
Oh! I can come back later if--
No, Kevin, please stay. There's something we need to discuss.
Yeah. Sure.
Everything okay?
I'm afraid it isn't.
The time we spent together today was truly magical.
Yeah, I thought so too.
But it isn't right.
Deep down, we both know it.
You need a wife and your darling little girl needs a mother.
Like it or not, I have a country to run.
And I can't be the wife and mother you both deserve.
That's not true.
Don't make this harder than it is.
-But you said-- -You must forget what I said.
I was emotional. I wasn't thinking.
Margaret, this isn't like you.
Please,
it's best for both of us if we end this now.
You and Olivia need to go home.
You really mean that?
Because if you do,
I'm not coming back…
ever.
[sighs] Goodbye, Kevin.
Bye!
Hello?
Hello, can anyone hear me?
Hello!
I still don't understand what happened.
She changed her mind. That's all.
Are you sure she wasn't pranking you?
Liv…
I know how much you care about Margaret,
but it's time to let go.
For both of us.
-But, Daddy-- -Livvie…
let's go.
Come on.
Get in the car.
Airport, please.
Very good, sir.
After the concert what happened?
We were separated for a few minutes at the reception,
and then she returned to the palace in her limousine.
Without you?
I'd been informed that she'd already left. So I took a separate car.
So something must have happened after the concert and before you returned.
-The drink! -Ah-ha! So you were drinking!
Not me, you fool.
The man with your cousin Fiona… Reggie.
-He spilled a drink on your dress. -Stacy's dress.
Yes, and then Fiona's secretary took her to the ladies' room.
-Ah-ha! -What are you thinking, Frank?
I have absolutely no idea, sir.
I think I know.
They made the switch in the powder room.
They kidnapped Stacy because they thought it was me.
-So the woman upstairs is your cousin. -I wouldn't put it past her.
And underneath all that peroxide, there is a striking resemblance.
So if Fiona's associates took Stacy,
where would they go?
I'm guessing they're at her father's old estate.
It's less than an hour away from here.
Right. I'll get the car.
I'll deal with Fiona.
Well, I wouldn't confront her just yet. Not while they still have Stacy.
Right, then we'll come with you.
Notify Count Rossi of our suspicions and have him delay the coronation.
Right away, Your Highness.
Bingo.
I honestly don't understand the urgency.
Then I shall review it for you again.
I intend to spend Christmas with those poor, poor orphans at St. Matthew's.
Aren't the orphans at St. Michael's?
I am in charge
and you as my loyal subject must do precisely what I tell you to do.
I would…
if you were really Lady Margaret.
But you're not, are you?
How dare you question me!
You're Margaret's cousin.
-I'll have you arrested for treason. -I don't think you will
-because I can prove it. -I'm calling the guards!
All it takes is a close look at your hand.
The little tattoo on your pinkie…
you should take greater care to cover it up.
So now what?
I'm guessing you're after money.
You're not stupid enough to think that you can maintain this charade for long.
So you can either make me a partner in your little scheme
or be exposed as an impostor and a traitor.
You don't need my money. You're filthy rich.
My eldest brother inherited the majority of the family estate,
which left me with expensive tastes and a very small income.
What about Margaret?
Once you've gotten what you came for,
you'll vanish without a trace, which means Margaret never has to know anything.
I'll make sure the coronation happens tonight.
And afterwards, you'll meet with the Chancellor of the Exchequer
and make an incredibly generous donation to a fictitious charity
of which you are the Chief Financial Officer.
As soon as you write a check to me for my services,
I'll arrange for your discreet departure.
You can do whatever you like with the rest of the money.
When we arrive, everyone keep alert.
There's no telling what we'll find when we get there.
Mm-hmm. And it's a good thing that these are registered weapons.
-Frank! Hands on the wheel! -All right!
Your dinner is served.
Hello?
Your Highnesty?
Hello?
You playing hide and seek?
You are!
Oy! Come here! -[Stacy panting] -[Reggie grunting]
Oh my God.
Is anyone there?
[Reggie] Mindy! Get her!
Where do you think you're going? Oh!
[Mindy] Help! Help me, Reggie.
[pounding] Reggie, get me out of here. Get me out of here. Reggie!
Oh! Whoa! Oh!
-Sir… -[Margaret] Oh dear, Edward!
Stacy? Can you hear me?
-[Edward] Stacy? -Thank God.
Come here!
They're over there! Go!
-Call the police! Frank, you're with me! -Always, sir. Always!
-[Stacy grunts] -[Edward] Get away from her!
I'm so sorry. I should have told you everything.
As long as you're all right, that's all that matters.
I promise you I will never make you feel like I'm too busy for you ever again.
And I promise I will never hover like a helicopter again.
Wait, what?
-It doesn't matter. -Okay.
Margaret--
[clears throat] I'm so terribly sorry to interrupt, Your Graces,
but Fiona is headed to the cathedral.
Right, let's go.
[archbishop] This is highly irregular.
The coronation is scheduled for tomorrow on Christmas Day.
But I'm going to be at St. Michael's on Christmas Day.
I've promised the orphans.
I thought the orphans were at St. Matthew's.
It's a world tour of orphans.
[Antonio] It may be an unusual request, Your Excellency,
but there's nothing in canon or civil law
that prevents an heir apparent from selecting the date of the coronation.
-[door opens] -I know the law, sir,
and it clearly states that a representative of the civil government
must be in attendance when a new monarch is crowned.
I spoke to the Prime Minister an hour ago.
And here she is now.
I see.
We'll need some time to prepare.
Wait a second, wasn't that the turnoff for the airport?
It was, but the bridge got washed away six months ago.
Terrible flood.
A flood? In June?
Summer storms can be so unpredictable.
-As long as we don't miss our flight, man. -We wouldn't want that.
Is Your Majesty willing and able
to take this sacred oath to uphold the laws and customs
of the Sovereign Nation of Montenaro?
Yes, I am.
Willing and able.
Then repeat after me.
I, Margaret Katherine Claire Delacourt…
I, Margaret Clara Karen--
Margaret Katherine Claire.
I, Margaret Katherine Claire…
-Dela-- -Delacourt, right.
I, Margaret Katherine Claire Delacourt--
I command you to stop these proceedings at once.
Oh, dear Lord. There are three of them.
No, Your Eminence.
There is only one Margaret Delacourt and I am she.
The woman you were about to crown as your queen is an impostor.
Antonio, tell them.
Guards, arrest this woman at once for treason.
Antonio, it's me.
Don't you dare!
And you are?
I'm Princess Stacy Juliette De Novo Wyndham of Belgravia.
Fiona kidnapped me thinking I was Margaret,
but I wasn't Margaret because Margaret and I switched places.
I'm very confused.
I understand exactly how you feel, Your Eminence,
but it seems the woman you're about to crown
is actually Lady Margaret's cousin.
Is this true?
Fiona, it's over.
-Reggie and Mindy are in police custody. -They confessed to everything.
Oh, all right, it's me,
but I didn't want to go through with it. That freak Antonio made me do it.
Margaret, she's lying.
You were ready to throw me in prison.
Look, if you'll only just listen to me--
I've listened long enough.
You almost had me convinced that I wasn't ready to rule on my own,
but the fact is I've never been more ready for anything in my life.
I love Montenaro.
I love its people and I've learned everything I can about them
for the past six months, so I can serve them to the best of my ability.
You don't know how to command.
Watch this.
Arrest him and take him to the dungeon.
I bet that felt good.
You have no idea.
One tiny teeny little question.
Since I technically didn't kidnap you, am I really guilty?
-Yes. -Yes.
But, Maggie Moo, it's Christmas and I'm your cuzzy.
Are you kidding? You committed treason!
Well, I didn't mean to.
You know, it's always been hard for me,
growing up with parents who despised me.
They didn't despise you.
The truth is I've always wanted to be you.
I just got carried away this time.
But I could never be half of what you are.
You were born to be queen, even though you didn't realize until now.
I owe you an apology, Moo.
I behaved abominably. I'm sorry.
You're the only real family I've ever had.
The only one who truly cares.
Poor, poor girl.
-Oh, please. -[Frank] What?
I suppose I could ask the judge for a reduced sentence.
[Stacy] Are you sure about that?
Along with supervised community service for many, many years.
[archbishop] I hate to interrupt,
but are we proceeding with the coronation?
The coronation will proceed on Christmas Day as scheduled.
Now if you all will excuse me, I really must call Kevin.
We were supposed to have dinner hours ago.
[Fiona] About Kevin…
What about Kevin?
He would have found me out, so I had to send him packing.
[Edward] Oh, dear.
Dear… -[text keys clicking]
No, he's not answering.
I'm guessing he's on his way to the airport with that small person.
His daughter?
He mentioned an Octavia.
You mean Olivia?
That's what I said.
Frank, get the car.
At the double, sir.
Keep the change, man.
Don't worry, sir.
Everything's gonna be all right. I guarantee it.
Yeah. Thanks.
It can't be. No. It can't. It can't.
[man on PA] This is the final boarding call for Monten-air flight 201 to Chicago.
That's us. Come on. Excuse me, sorry.
[Edward] Wait here, Frank.
Right, let's go. Right.
Looks like we made it on time.
[Margaret] Kevin!
Kevin.
Come on.
Kevin!
Kevin, please don't leave. I can explain everything.
You look like Stacy but you sound like Margaret.
Well, because I am Margaret.
We never switched back.
Why are you dressed like that?
Fiona kidnapped me and took Margaret's place.
Right…
Don't you get it?
It wasn't Margaret who told you to leave. It was Fiona.
[Kevin] Is that true?
Nothing has ever been more true.
I can't imagine my life without you.
I can't imagine my life without you.
Well, then…
Marry me?
That's what I was gonna ask you last summer.
-[Edward gasps, chuckles] -Wait.
Would someone say yes, please?
-Yes. -Yes.
Why don't we make this official right now?
Oh, that's what I love about you.
Be right back.
[clears throat] Excuse me.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother, we'd like to be married.
What, here, now?
Aren't you…
Margaret Delacourt, the future queen. Yes.
This is my fiancé, Kevin.
Well, my flight boards in five minutes.
I'm sure they'll hold your flight for a royal wedding.
An abridged version would be fine.
-I wouldn't want to impose. -Are you sure about this?
Real sure. Come on.
All right.
Perfect.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today in the sight--
[man on PA] Monten-air Flight 507, nonstop service to London Heathrow,
is now ready for boarding at Gate 58.
That's my flight.
Just cut to the chase.
Have you prepared your vows?
I think we can wing it.
I promise to walk by your side forever…
to love and support you in everything that you do.
And maybe someday teach you how to make a hot chocolate.
I love you, Margaret.
I always have and I always will.
I love you too.
Dearest Kevin, I wish I could promise you the world,
but the world is not mine to give.
What I can promise you
is my world
because it would be empty without you.
I don't suppose you have a ring.
-[laughs] Oh. -I bought it last summer.
It's beautiful.
Do you, Kevin, take Margaret to be your lawful wedded wife?
Oh, yeah.
Do you, Margaret, take Kevin to be your lawful wedded husband?
I absolutely do.
What God has brought together, let no man put asunder--
[man on PA] This is the final boarding call for Monten-air Flight 507,
nonstop service to London Heathrow.
All ticketed passengers should proceed immediately to Gate 58.
I now pronounce you man and wife. Now I am out of here!
Oh! You may now kiss the bride.
Come here.
-And she just so happens to be a queen. -Oh, yeah.
-The clerk says it's time. -Oh, she's almost ready.
I'll tell him.
Edward.
I know our first two years together have been kind of crazy.
I already told you, you don't need to apologize.
It's more of an explanation than an apology.
I wanted so badly to be the perfect princess
and do everything right that…
I forgot about what's important.
And what's that?
It's you and me.
And maybe one day our very own little prince or princess.
I'd like that very much.
We really have to start.
Give us a minute.
Is Your Majesty willing and able to take the sacred oath
to uphold the laws and customs of the Sovereign Nation of Montenaro
and to protect her against enemies without and within?
[Margaret] I'm willing and able.
Then repeat after me.
I, Margaret Katherine Claire Delacourt…
I, Margaret Katherine Claire Delacourt…
…will rule with compassion, extending justice and mercy to all my people.
…will rule with compassion, extending justice and mercy to all my people.
All this I have promised
I will perform as champion of my beloved country and her people.
In accordance with law and custom,
I crown you Margaret Katherine Claire Delacourt, Queen of Montenaro.
Long live the Queen.
Long live the Queen!
I told you. Of course, Miss.
As you can see, the bathroom is well equipped,
but for two it may be on the small side.
-Or not. -Or not.
The mirror is nice.
It's big.
It has a lot of potential.
And here you have… first-rate marble.
If you stand here, you can imagine what a normal day would be like,
brushing your teeth or…
getting ready for a night out of grinding, and…
let's imagine that your boyfriend shows up
and tells you how sexy you are
and how much he wants to fuck you.
Good luck.
-Nice to meet you. -Likewise.
-Hi. -Please come in.
-Lucía, right? A pleasure. -Weren't we the first?
A colleague gave her an appointment.
She's going to leave a deposit, but if you like, we'll leave her hanging.
Come in, please.
And for you?
Look, we can take these.
Is there any news about the office course?
Girl,
it took me two years to get out of here.
Yes, but anyone can do this.
Sure.
Will you finish that too?
Hello?
Yes, that's me.
Thank you, Holy Mary, for listening to me.
For giving me this new opportunity.
I know I'm ready.
I need you to help me.
To give me the confidence and the strength I need.
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with you…
-Sofía? -Yes.
That's me.
Good morning.
Go ahead.
Well, I studied finance at the University of Buenos Aires,
I did a master's in International Business.
An MBA here.
I was top of my class in the department.
I've also worked in several companies in this sector:
Davandra, Fun&Co…
Belén, send me the briefing for later.
Of course, right away.
My thesis was about your company.
Last time I submitted my résumé, I attached it.
I think starting all this… from scratch is incredible.
Answer it.
What?
Hello?
Yes, this is Beatriz Gaya's office, how may I help you?
Yes, I understand.
Yes, our apologies.
Give me the mailing details.
Yes, we'll check with the courier and you'll be reimbursed.
How about we send you a cocktail dress from the new collection, free of charge?
Perfect, Aurora.
Don't hesitate to call if anything else comes up.
What?
Incredible.
Well, thanks.
You too, but I meant her.
What? Right. Really nice. Okay.
It's just she's so strong.
She had nothing. She was a nobody.
She built her whole empire.
Working, trusting herself…
Can you believe that her first job was dressing corpses?
No way.
Clothing for wakes.
That's creepy.
Listen,
the lady I showed the apartment to today told me that she knows a guy
the lady I showed the apartment to today told me that she knows a guy who owns two buildings in the center.
Dude, that's great.
I'm sure you'll get them for the agency.
Of course.
But I want them for myself.
Well…
you need the money first.
Well, you know I'm saving.
And now you'll be meeting lots of real estate tycoons, for sure.
Absolutely not.
But, honey, you're doing an internship, right?
-Yes. -They'll definitely end up hiring you.
I hope so.
It's what I want most in the world.
A first-class ticket to Zurich at 18:00.
Her usual menu.
The fabric supplier in London is requesting an upward revision of the contract.
-Did you quote my previous reply? -Yes.
Send it again.
Always shake hands. Good morning.
Good morning.
-Thank you for coming. -Ricardo.
-I'm Sofía. -A pleasure.
I'll let you know if I need you.
My bag.
-Come in, please. -Thank you very much.
Right…
Go home.
-If she comes back, I'll say you're sick. -No, I'm fine. Thanks.
When will I get to attend the meetings?
Do I attend?
Sofía.
Sofía, it's very late.
Go on, go home.
Lidia?
Hello.
I thought even though you had no profile picture, you'd be hot, but…
I underestimated you.
-Do you want a drink? -Please.
What are you doing? Not like this.
-Come here. -No.
Get off me, dammit!
Okay.
You don't like that.
I'm sorry.
LUJÁN 2011 MOTHER, HELP US TO TAKE CARE OF LIFE
What are you doing up?
What's the queen of the house saying?
I'm making you a special energizing continental Mediterranean breakfast.
Because my cutie pie seemed a bit sick this week and I can't have that.
I don't feel like it now.
You just sit tight, okay? The second course is on its way.
I think what you really need is a holiday.
Last night I was on my phone and I found super-cheap flights to Medellín.
Well, if we buy them now.
What do you say? It's now, or they'll go up.
I don't know what I'll be doing in two months.
I know, honey, but…
I haven't been back for two years.
Nor have I to Buenos Aires.
Well, then, just ask for ten days off.
I can't ask for ten, or two, or five. Nothing.
You can't or you don't want to?
What's your Romeo's name?
I have no idea.
Are you joking?
What's this?
What?
I can't believe it, you've fallen too.
-At last. -I don't look bad, do I?
I think I look sexy.
No, you don't look bad.
They're so young.
They don't know anything.
They're like a cake full of air.
Is it still worth it?
Life is designed so badly. By the time you know what you want, you're out of time.
Cut the drama.
We're still at the halfway point.
I envy you. Everything's always seemed fine to you.
And which of us is the millionaire?
What is it?
Maybe with paillettes on the sleeves?
I know.
May I?
Show me.
I think that, by adding a double cuff,
we could achieve an effect that's more… sophisticated, which…
is missing.
Like the '98 Adriana.
The '98, did you say?
-I don't think it matches the collection. -Sorry.
It's normal, this isn't your area.
Step aside.
I like it.
Another beer.
-Thanks, Benja. -Thanks, Benja.
You're welcome.
So, what's wrong?
Nothing, honey.
Really.
How's work?
Good.
I did some calculations, and what I'm saving here won't get me anywhere, but in Colombia it'd be a different story.
won't get me anywhere, but in Colombia it'd be a different story.
Look, the agencies here are too big, I don't have the money to hire anyone.
Okay.
But I was talking to my Uncle Jorge
and he'll rent us an office for next to nothing in Robledo.
I could have my team there. It'd be the best for both of us.
Robledo.
Don't you think?
I don't know, honey.
Honey, Madrid is getting too big for us.
I'm not getting ahead here and you don't have a life.
Honey, we barely see each other. How will I start a family?
How will I take the next step?
How will we prosper? How will we move forward?
Family?
Honey, I didn't come here to go back, I didn't come here to move to Colombia,
and even less to be a kept woman.
I'm not saying you'd be a kept woman.
I'm saying you'd work with me in something relaxed.
I don't want to be relaxed.
I want to be exhausted.
I want to be afraid of messing up. I want…
to learn from her all the time, constantly.
I work 12 hours a day with her, and you know what?
It's not enough.
It's not enough.
Right.
Can I ask where you're going?
Just to Barcelona.
See you downstairs in an hour.
It was an amazing food. Food from Asia, you know. Japanese food,
Chinese food, Filipino food…
And I just take it, and I was eating it to my face
and I meet just a beautiful woman.
And I tell her, "Oh, the food is amazing."
"Are you the cook?" And she told me, "No, I'm the consul's wife."
God!
-I wanted to disappear, you know? -That's true.
-I was sha-- -Hi. How you doing?
Hi, Jonathan, good to see you.
-And you. -Hi, nice to meet you.
-Take a seat. -Lovely to see you, finally.
What's he doing here?
Since you seem prone to leave me, I feel like flirting.
He's a newbie, an upstart, he worked for me till last year.
Yes, and he's full of energy and lack of ego.
My company's ready to optimize your former dealing ten percent.
We won't add a pound for ten years.
You really haven't heard it?
It sounds familiar, but I don't think so.
Yes, without a doubt.
And the other one?
It's only the lingerie left.
Come on, try it on.
I want to see if I chose well.
Let's see.
Perfect.
Let me try something.
It makes you look stronger.
You'll need to be, now you have a job in the company.
I thought it was good news.
It is.
The best.
Father…
I need to know that God will forgive me.
Is your regret sincere?
What was your sin, my child?
The Lord's infinite mercy will cleanse you,
but you must first show courage to confess.
I want…
I'm going to end the life that I carry inside me, Father.
I wanted to avoid it, and… I hesitated.
Every day.
But not anymore.
Will God forgive me?
There's no worst crime than… spilling the blood of the innocent.
Good morning.
What?
Carmen…
you've had ten registered absences in recent months.
They were all justified.
I brought doctor's notes, and made up the hours.
No one's questioning you, but…
You know about my daughter, right?
You need all of your time for her.
It's a good severance package.
I don't want to choose between my daughter and my job.
I've been in this company 15 years. I'm part of it.
You have to learn it.
No one taught us to act like that.
They're allowed to be bastards.
"Determination" they call it.
So don't feel guilty.
Sofía, what is it?
Come here. Come.
-I'm… -Easy.
You're what?
What, what are you?
No…
Wait.
No, wait!
Easy.
Sofía,
you're not pregnant?
Did you know when you started?
No.
I thought you knew what you were doing.
I don't get it. You were doing so well…
I don't get it either.
I'm sorry.
Who knows?
You.
You can't do anything else, unless you want to pay half in taxes.
It's 25%. You submit a promissory note in December and they deduct it in June.
They're doing it for music festivals, events, startups…
Everyone at the firm is jumping in.
Hey, Mr. Lawyer, is that legal?
I don't want more inspections.
Everyone's doing it. What inspections? It's the only way to reduce the fee.
I'm having a child.
What?
Sofía's.
Your assistant?
Yes.
She's pregnant and she doesn't want to have an abortion or quit her job.
She'll give it to you?
How far along is she?
And whose is it? Is she single?
No, but he doesn't know anything. She told me.
Have you thought it through?
Listen, wouldn't it be easier for you to adopt?
I want a baby and I can't anymore.
-Yes, but isn't there another way? -No.
I want to experience the pregnancy.
Be with it from the beginning, know it.
-Will you support me? -Of course.
For everything. As always.
Of course.
Offer her money.
Lots of money.
I knew I needed to bring out the good wine.
Tati!
Another bottle, please.
-Ready? Are you alone? -Yes.
Do you know why I hired you?
Because you're good at your job.
Because you find solutions.
I don't believe we can work our way out of any mess… and not this one.
Are you serious?
I am.
Take your time.
Don't tell anyone. You'll think clearer that way.
I haven't told anyone yet.
There's always a way out. Always.
Sofía…
I'm here to help you.
Whatever you need.
Thank you, Beatriz.
Really.
Go to sleep. It's very late.
Thank you.
Tell me, Sofía, when was your first missed period?
In… February.
All right.
There it is.
There it is, yes.
It's so small.
Of course.
Well, Sofía, I'm going to explain the procedure.
Here we take care of the check-ups and tests,
both before and after, okay?
For the procedure, we'll refer you to a specialized clinic.
It's a short operation. It won't hurt.
It feels a bit like period cramps, that's all.
In fact, they won't put you to sleep. Sedatives are usually enough.
When they've taken effect, they will dilate your uterus with rods,
and the suction will begin.
It will take five to ten minutes.
They have to be sure that your uterus is empty.
What is that?
Sorry, it's a control device. Do you want me to turn it off?
Are you okay?
I can't.
I can't see it.
There!
Sofía, what are you doing?
I don't know what to do.
I…
I can't have an abortion.
Look,
I've been giving it a lot of thought,
and…
I'll just tell you.
I have a proposal for you.
It's going to sound a little weird, but you'll see.
You'll be able to become a mother whenever you want.
Whenever you decide.
But now is not the time, is it?
All right.
I have always wanted to be a mother.
And…
And I thought… that I could keep your baby.
-You know people do these things, right? -Yes, surrogacy…
No, not that.
This would be different. It…
I mean, it wouldn't be a surrogacy because…
Because what you and I would do is something that would benefit both of us.
I help you. You help me.
The baby will be fine. I promise.
But can you do that? How…?
Well, we'd need to sign an agreement or something, of course.
And you would stay by my side in the company, of course.
What you and Beatriz want to do isn't completely legal.
You know they're still very cautious about that matter here.
Although, one way or another, people have always done it, right?
In some countries it's legal, and the birth mother can receive money.
It's a case of having a document which clearly states what each of you is agreeing to,
and which states that you are both aware of what you are going to do.
Beatriz will be the biological mother from the start, the real biological mother,
and… nothing else. Well,
basically, this will be a third-world adoption,
but I'll take care of that, don't worry.
In short, you must relinquish all rights
In short, you must relinquish all rights in this matter from the intervention onward.
-The intervention is the delivery, right? -Exactly.
I will oversee the whole process. The intervention will happen at my clinic.
So only what we decide will be known.
In other words, nothing.
We must maintain absolute confidentiality. It's the only way.
I'll cover all the care expenses, of course.
Including after the procedure. Whatever you need.
About two to three days in the hospital is normal.
Yes. And in exchange,
Beatriz guarantees that your position in the company will be protected,
and on the day of the intervention you will receive financial compensation
equal to the highest received in Europe for this.
I want double that compensation.
Double? But, Sofía, it will be under the table.
You're earning more than those girls.
And it's quite a lot.
Of course, but they are within the law,
and I'm not.
Things could go very bad for me if this gets out. Prison, deportation…
That risk must also be compensated.
No, there won't be that risk,
because Beatriz wants you to spend the pregnancy at her home.
-The entire pregnancy? -Yes.
And I couldn't see anyone, right?
No one should see you.
We can only do this in secret, Sofía.
We have no other choice.
It will only be a few months.
What about my job? I want to stay up to date.
Of course, I'll keep you posted. We will be living together.
Double the compensation and add two trips a year to Argentina.
I told you she was smart.
Were you always like this, or did I create a monster?
You're the only one I'd do this with.
I didn't tell Nacho anything.
Of course.
He won't be going through pregnancy, delivery, breastfeeding,
nor will he put his career on hold.
He just had an orgasm.
I won't breastfeed either.
And Nacho is my boyfriend.
I love him.
I know. I'm sorry.
But,
if you had told him, you wouldn't have been free to decide.
What if he tells you he disagrees?
Perhaps we could have gone ahead with it, but you'd have lost him.
Right?
Sometimes we can't do things perfectly.
Only the best we can.
THE SURROGATE MOTHER
-It… -Don't worry, it's fine like that.
All right, perfect. That's it.
If this one didn't persuade you, there's a wonderful
If this one didn't persuade you, there's a wonderful and very light apartment two blocks away.
We can go see it now.
-Do you have time? -No, I'm going for a drink. Thanks.
Okay. Here's my card.
-Thank you. -Nice to meet you.
Okay, see you.
Hi.
-What are you doing here? Coming with me? -Yes.
…the site dynamics, I'll report on the functioning of each department,
suggest changes…
And I would go from assistant to manager.
With double the salary.
But it's London. We have to talk about it.
I've already… said yes.
You've got to be fucking kidding me. Are you serious?
Honey.
I had to pass on the Colombia thing, and you've already decided this.
Why don't you take the opportunity and go there?
No way.
Half a year? Without you?
Impossible.
I'm doing this for you too, okay?
As well?
It will go by so fast.
And when I'm done, I will have moved up and saved lots of money.
For both of us.
And we'll be a family someday.
Do you think it doesn't hurt me?
I wish I could get what I want without having to go through this.
But it's the only way.
And it has a positive side.
Let's not give it too much thought.
Will you have a house? I'll come visit.
And spend all of your savings on those trips?
You're ending it with me.
No! Honey.
I'm not ending anything.
I'm asking you to support me.
This is really important for me.
Please.
I love you.
Where are we going?
It's a surprise.
-I thought we were-- -You'll be better off than in the city.
I'm laughing now.
-I almost had a heart attack then. -Really?
Imagine,
you're dressing the corpse of a 90-year-old lady and suddenly, bam!
Her eyes open as if she had risen from the dead.
Dammit! What's wrong? It won't open.
There.
Good morning.
Good morning. Did you sleep well?
Very well.
That music means breakfast. You'll salivate just from hearing it.
Hi.
I think it's a birth defect. She hasn't learned a word in six months.
Do you know how much the others speak? But she's a great cook.
-She has your diet. -I know.
No cold cuts, no alcohol and no raw fish.
Cristina made this list for you too. It's not just food.
There are also cosmetics, types of clothing, habits…
You can blame her, but don't ignore it.
Okay.
I have to run. Have a great day.
You too.
Thank you very much.
Sweet Mary,
thank you for protecting me.
Did I scare you?
A little bit.
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.
Now it's time for the hurdles step.
Start with your hands over your shoulders, like so. Feet together.
Lift your knee and extend your leg. Touch the ground with your heel, and back.
Fluid movements.
Hi.
Hi.
Are you… watching me?
What?
I saw the cameras.
-Are you watching me? -The security system.
You're not used to it, are you?
Nor do I want to be.
Sweetie, I won't leave the house unprotected because you're paranoid.
Or you.
-I'd rather you removed them. -Do you think I have time to watch you?
Beatriz, please.
I…
I can't live like this.
I won't remove the ones outside.
Okay.
But inside, I'd like to feel free.
-Yes? -Yes!
Thank you.
What do you think?
I don't like them. Keep looking.
You'll have to continue handling my schedule.
Of course.
I'll call a few more today to interview them.
You were right to send her to London. I never liked her.
She was an opportunist.
I liked her.
But she did want my job, you're right.
Now she's where she belongs.
Tati, have you seen my phone?
I've lost it.
Elbows out. Hands over your ears. Lift your knee. Extend your leg.
Touch the ground with your heel and back. Like sitting on a stool.
This exercise requires space. You must be on the mark to begin.
I'm on the mark!
This exercise requires space. You must be on the mark to get started.
I'm on the mark.
Lift your knee. Extend your…
Enough! Will you shut up?
…knee. Extend your leg. Touch the ground with your heel, and--
Can't sleep?
One, two, three.
Give me your phone.
Phone.
You don't have one?
Fuck it.
MY BABY AND ME
I lost it.
What have you lost?
My phone.
But you haven't left here.
-Don't worry, I'll buy you another one. -Nacho must be…
-Don't worry, I'll buy you another one. -Nacho must be… super pissed off.
I'm sure he loves you now more than ever.
I don't know. I'm scared.
He's too sweet.
I hope so.
Look, she already has it.
-Yes. -Why does it appear?
Estrogen cause an increase in melanin secretion,
and it's more noticeable on her because her skin is a bit darker,
right?
Very good. There it is.
Yes!
How are you feeling, Sofía? Is everything okay?
Yes.
-She quit doing pilates. -No…
You can't stop exercising.
What if she swam? She likes that.
I'll make daily charts for you.
In any case, the tests the other day were perfect.
Fluid retention and itching are both normal.
But if there's anything, if you feel anything strange, tell me, okay?
No, everything is fine.
Are those the eyes?
Hello.
Beatriz?
Beatriz, are you all right?
Good morning.
Good morning. What about the phone?
I've ordered it. The good ones take time to arrive, as you know.
See you later.
Tati.
May I come in?
The key.
Key.
The door.
The door upstairs.
Sofía!
Sofía!
For me?
Happy birthday!
Hello.
-Hello. -And this too.
HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DOG
Hello, Max.
Max? No, not Max.
Yes, you're Max.
-Well then, Max it is. -Hello.
Now he wants to invest in wineries.
-Wineries? -He wants to persuade you.
-No, please, not again. -He already convinced me…
Did you know today's a special day, Max?
…he brought three bottles of…
They're letting me eat cake.
And I had… of course I was trying them…
Come.
…you don't know how far…
Come to the bathroom with me. I don't want you to hear odd stuff.
…in the end I think I invested in La Mancha wineries.
You should know that he even…
Well…
-Hey… -What?
How do you think she's doing?
Her hormones are altered, but otherwise fine.
-Fine. -Are you sure?
Yes, really.
-Fine. -Don't you think…
I don't know, that maybe…
she's having second thoughts?
No. Well, I don't know, I don't think so.
-Well, it's difficult for her. Imagine… -Difficult?
-She's basically on holiday. -On holiday?
Cristina, please…
Max. Max is a nice name. I like it.
-Well… -Yes, it's nice.
Is Beatriz's child also going to be a boy?
I mean… I won't keep him, but I'd like to know.
Yes, he's going to be a boy.
Cheers.
-Congratulations. -Thank you.
Look what I just received.
You have a gift.
I want to talk to him.
It's my birthday.
Okay.
VIDEOCALL
Hello, my darling.
Hi.
What happened?
-Happy birthday. -Thank you.
Fucking hell.
Don't ever do this to me again.
I was going crazy.
I called you. I sent you a thousand messages.
-I almost called the police. -No.
I'm fine.
I lost… I lost my phone and…
I was very busy.
But tomorrow or the next day I'll have a new one, so…
I'll be contactable.
How are you?
Listen…
Sofi, please, I beg you, don't do this to me. Just tell me now.
I'd rather you were honest with me.
I miss you so much.
-I don't know… -And I love you.
-I don't know. -Very much.
I think that… Sofi…
-Are you sure you love me? -Yes, my love.
It won't be long now.
Enough.
Honey?
My love, what is it? Are you upset?
Sofía, what is it?
Look, I don't know what to say. I don't know what to do.
-I… Are you sure you love me? -Honey, I have to go.
-No… -We'll talk in the next few days, okay?
Sofi, please… Sofi…
-Honey… -No, now, Sofi, please. Don't go.
Hello.
Dammit, Max!
What did you do?
Tati?
Be good, Max.
Tati?
Hi. Hello…
I'm looking for Sofía Cuadros.
Sorry, what?
Sorry…
Never?
I need her phone.
Do you, sorry, do you have a phone? A number or something?
Okay. Thank you.
I'm tired.
Only ten more lengths. Come on.
Why did Tati leave?
Look at you. It's already noticeable.
You think she'll report us?
She can't speak Spanish.
If you stop now, it'll be harder later.
I'll do ten extra tomorrow.
Your chart says 50 lengths.
I can't do any more. Really.
Didn't you hear me? Come on!
-Just for today, please. -Come on.
-I don't want to. -Come on.
I told you I don't want to.
It's only ten more lengths.
Beatriz.
Not now, Belén.
It's Sofía.
You have to get her out of London too. She lied to us.
Lied about what?
She has no degree.
Just a college seminar with no grade.
The schools where she got her master's don't exist.
And her work experience…
She's just a sales clerk.
Are you sure?
-Do you want to call yourself? -No.
Hello, Beatriz.
Cristina, did you know that Argentinian has never set foot in a university?
Well,
everyone lies to get a job.
This bitch lied about everything.
So what?
How can I trust her now?
Okay, she lied because she's an opportunist,
and if she is an opportunist, she'll comply. It suits her.
Cristina, you haven't carried a child.
I'll call you back.
Okay.
Sofía!
Sofía!
Hi.
What have you done?
Nothing.
Nothing?
I touched the door. That's it.
The security company could have come. If they see you here, it all goes to shit.
Tomorrow's the quarterly balance report.
I'll tell you how it goes.
The goal was to double the previous one, but I don't know.
The phone doesn't work.
But it was very expensive.
I don't know. It doesn't work.
Lend me your tablet today.
I don't want you to be there.
It was very uncomfortable.
Not today.
What do you mean?
I didn't agree to be your slave.
Go. Isn't that what you want?
Do you think I'm against you?
That I want to ruin your life?
Well, go on then! Go!
It would've been much easier for me to be a mother another way.
Have you forgotten how you felt when you didn't know what to do?
Fuck.
I just want to do things right.
I know it's very hard for you to be cooped up here without Nacho.
And your body's changing, which makes you much more sensitive…
And you're experiencing everything more…
But never forget that this is for us both.
Shall I close it?
-All good? Need anything else? -The bill, please.
Right away.
It won't be long now.
I wanted to thank you for being so brave.
It's normal that you miss him.
This is starting to get heavy.
Are you okay?
Beatriz.
I can't sleep.
Come here.
I'll be in Madrid the whole summer.
And I work mornings at the store so…
-Let's keep in touch? -Sure.
-Do you have my number? -I think so.
Wait, I'll call you.
"Mario the Colombian," here you are.
Bye.
MISSED CALL
The second proposal is a variation of the first, this time with the Allegra model.
I think this could be our best bet for big events.
The last proposal is a contrast with the previous ones.
It fits well because of the contrast of the pure lines and the baroque feel.
Beatriz, what do you think?
-Beatriz? -Eh?
Excuse me.
Shit! Shit!
Sorry, Max.
What have you done?
-Can you move? -Yes.
Goddammit!
Another step.
Be careful.
There.
Let's see… Lie down.
There.
-Are you all right? -Yes.
Okay…
Very well.
Cristina, call me when you can, please. It's urgent.
…I've talked to make-up.
-Perfect. How long will it take? -Twelve.
-Twelve. -Exactly.
-Good morning. -Okay.
I'm here to ask about Sofía Cuadros.
You won't find her here.
-She's at the London headquarters. -No.
She's not there.
Don't you know anything?
The boss, where is she?
She's not here either. If you leave your number I can… Hey!
I told you she's not here.
What are you doing?
Didn't you hear me?
The boss, where is she?
No. Okay.
-Cristina. -No, it's me, Belén.
A guy's here for Sofía.
Tell me where Beatriz Gaya is.
-What's he like? -Handsome. About thirty.
-Don't let him leave, I'm on my way. -Okay, I'll wait for you.
-Tell me! -Please, don't do anything to me.
This isn't about you.
Can you help me? Tell me where Beatriz Gaya lives.
Here, drink this.
-A bit more. -Enough.
This number is currently unavailable. Please leave your message.
Belén, is he still there?
No. He's gone.
What did he want? What did he want to know?
He wanted your address.
And you gave it to him?
Well, it's just that…
-The new girl was really scared. -Fuck!
-I'm sorry. Should we call the police? -No, don't call anybody.
Hello?
Nacho?
Hello?
Nacho!
-Sofía, is that you? Open up! -What are you doing here?
How did you find me?
I went to the company.
No, please. Be careful.
-Sofía… -She's… crazy.
I'm not well. I think she gave me something.
What did she give you?
Sofía, open up!
-Sofía… -It's just…
Call the police.
Honey, it's okay. I'll get you out. I'm going to call the police.
Fucking phone…
Yes, get help.
I have no signal here, but I will find it.
No, please don't go. Don't leave me alone.
Don't leave me alone, Nacho!
Hello. Yes? Hello!
Dammit!
Hello?
Nacho…
Help!
I'm back.
Are you okay?
Yes.
I'm going to fix you some dinner.
-I'm not hungry. -You have to eat.
Beatriz.
What?
I thought you would be mad at me after what I did.
I was so relieved you weren't really hurt, that I got over my anger.
You were right in the end.
It's my mood.
-My hormones are driving me crazy. -Don't worry.
-I don't know what I'm doing. -Yes, it's normal.
Besides, it'll all be over soon.
I have… I have a surprise for you.
Sofía, I've been looking over the latest ultrasounds we did
and I will check you again tomorrow.
Is there a problem?
On the contrary. It's going so well that it may end sooner than expected.
If we can confirm it tomorrow, you'll have a cesarean.
Why?
-Explain it to me, please. -Didn't you want this to be over?
Well, wish granted.
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow.
Whatever you say.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
What will you do when the baby is born? Run the company from home?
I can't leave anyone else in charge.
They could sink it in a month.
Will we continue to work together?
Of course.
I miss work so much…
You don't know how much.
I know.
I'm thirsty all the time.
Do you want anything?
No, thanks, I'm fine.
Sofía, what have you done?
Saved myself.
What?
You wanted to take my son and get rid of me, right?
You think I want to kill you?
Whoever pays calls the shots.
Isn't that right?
I wanted a child.
And you wanted a future. We agreed on that.
Where's Nacho?
Nacho?
I don't know. What are you talking about?
Where is he?
You bitch!
Shut up!
Bring the contract. Bring… the contract.
We'll tear it up and you go.
I won't report you for this, I swear!
Isn't that what you want?
I don't know what I want! I don't know!
Sofía!
Sofía!
Sofía, I need some water!
Sofía!
Sofía, we need to talk, for God's sake!
Where is it?
-What? -The money.
There must be money in this house.
Are you going to rob me?
Beatriz, tell me where it is.
This is ridiculous.
I offered you a new life and you're changing it for a few euros?
Where?
You're throwing it all away for nothing.
I have the contract.
If you report me, I'll make it public.
I will ruin you.
I was wrong about you.
I thought you were ready to be someone.
I am someone.
We're two people.
Sofía, you can't leave me here.
They'll find me dead.
And your prints are all over the house. Untie me!
I swear I'll let you go. Sofía!
Max.
Max.
