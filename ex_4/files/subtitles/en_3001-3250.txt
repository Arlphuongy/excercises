I want to cherish our last day.
"Cherish"?
This isn't a school field trip. Get real.
Watch out for the hill!
1988 SAUDI ARABIA
Those crazy bastards.
Kareem!
Faster. Let's go!
All right!
You've got guns this time?
-I knew it'd be something scary. -Get the sand off.
Brush it off.
You'd never know this unless you've been in the army. Here.
Take it out.
I have a bad feeling.
I hope it isn't a wanted poster.
Dong-wook!
Mr. Yoon!
I was going to rip it up! -Be careful. -Are you that happy?
Dong-wook has dreamed of this competition.
You'll need a lot of money for that.
It'll be hard to make this much money in the US.
Come back anytime if you change your mind.
I gotta admit. You're the best drivers in Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Yoon, Dong-wook is the best in the world.
-He's number one! -Oh, please.
Even Americans are no match for Dong-wook.
You will get yourselves killed if you drive around the US like that.
Be careful, all right?
I won't charge for the repairs or other expenses for the sake of our friendship.
for the sake of our friendship. Mr. Yoon,
I wish you a long life.
Don't you have something for me?
You bastards.
Of course we do.
Here, Mr. Yoon.
Get lost, you jerks! Get out of my sight!
Hey!
Are you going to eat jajangmyeon when you get home?
Mansour!
Goodbye.
Where are you going?
We're going home now.
Where is home?
'88 OLYMPICS CONFIRMED AN OVERWHELMING VICTORY
WISHING SUCCESS IN THE SEOUL OLYMPICS
-Bye. -Goodbye, ladies!
Look who it is.
How have you been?
It seems like you made it from Saudi Arabia.
You two look amazing today!
-Joon-gi! -Bok-nam!
Dong-wook!
McDonald's!
Thanks, Bok-nam!
McDonald's in Seoul? What a great world we live in.
That's what's so great about Seoul.
"The world to Seoul. Seoul to the world." Okay?
Hey.
Wow, you got a new taxi?
You're successful!
You know, in English, you say, "This is my car."
Just open the trunk.
I got a new car, and I'm here to pick you guys up.
Hey, Park Dong-wook!
Bok-nam.
-Get in! -What's wrong?
The trunk hasn't been loaded yet.
What's the matter?
Who are they?
I don't know. I've never seen them before.
You don't know?
Did you get in trouble again in Saudi Arabia?
My hamburger.
Hamburger?
Let's just load these up and leave.
MAINTENANCE OF VISIBLE AREAS REDEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 2
Bok-nam.
Our neighborhood…
How did this happen?
FIX THIS PROJECT THAT DOESN'T ENSURE HOUSING
It's the Olympics.
They're making a fuss over the maintenance project.
They tore everything down.
What's it called? Right. "Maintenance of Visible Areas."
What's it called? Right. "Maintenance of Visible Areas." Maintenance, my ass. This is basically a war zone.
Maintenance, my ass. This is basically a war zone.
Don't you agree?
Drive.
Well, this is a nice welcome.
Park Dong-wook.
I bet you missed the taste of kimchi.
Let's go, boys!
SANGGYE-DONG REDEVELOPMENT AREA
Move! I can't see him!
Hey, it's Galchi!
Wow, they're still here?
Park Dong-wook.
I've been practicing like hell while you were gone.
That moron.
What does he want now?
Why does he hate you so much?
What did you do wrong?
What do you think you're doing?
Step on it!
Watch this. I'll show you a real vibe.
Hey!
Hey, Dong-wook!
Dude, what's up with you?
Dong-wook!
Spin!
Turn on the wipers! Quickly!
Where is he? Park Dong-wook, where did you go?
Find him!
Park Dong-wook, where did you go?
DO NOT DEMOLISH PEOPLE LIVE HERE!
LARGE BBANGKKU
Dong-wook!
What the hell are you wearing?
Damn it.
Stop acting like you were in North Korea.
Yoon-hee, you've gotten even prettier.
My Joon-gi, how have you been?
-You missed me? -Hey.
I told you not to ride bikes.
Hey.
I became the head of the Seoul branch.
-I'm the bike queen. -You're in a bike gang now?
No, that's what you do. Just with four wheels.
Let's go eat meat. Aren't you hungry?
-Yes, she's right. -I'll grill meat for you.
-You did it back there too. -Drop it.
Come on!
CAR MAINTENANCE CONTEST 05.10.1987
You punk.
That nutjob.
Brother Dong-wook, Brother Joon-gi, welcome.
Jeez.
Forget about all the coarse sand.
This is Bbangkku, a land flowing with milk and honey.
But I see you're empty-handed. Can you explain why?
Oh, right!
I left it at the airport because of some sketchy guys chasing us.
Are you saying you've got nothing for me?
Gifts, my ass. We almost died on our way here.
Died? Did I hear that right?
By the way, what's this? This isn't Jamaica.
How come your style has become even tackier?
What an eyesore.
Brother, did you get a blast of sand in your eyes in the desert?
Let's get your eyes checked. I'll get you glasses.
Look at how hip they are.
Whatever. Where did you put my babies?
I hid them in the back, punk.
Seriously…
Now it looks good.
Put this back where it was.
Get rid of all of your shiny crap.
What's up with you?
You have no idea who's been taking care of Bbangkku and everything else.
The first thing you say when you come back--
Are those customers?
Wait, maybe they're the guys from…
What are you doing?
What did you do?
-Bring it on. -Who is it?
Jeez, that sly bastard.
Park Dong-wook.
Did you just say "bastard"?
No wonder they say you can't change people. Watch your mouth.
Anyway, Dong-wook, you've still got your driving skills.
You dumbass. I just wanted to talk, but you ran like your life depended on it.
You brought many things.
When will you come to your senses?
This is why you shouldn't be soft with ex-convicts.
-It's burning! -Damn.
You shouldn't burn your meat.
You used to talk about the US, and now you're having LA ribs.
Hey, mister!
Who are you? Do you have a warrant?
Everybody asks for a warrant.
Kids these days watch too much TV.
-Did you watch Chief Investigator too? -What?
I bet you haven't seen a real prosecutor before.
DISTRICT PROSECUTOR
Those guys have seen me before. Hey, give it to me.
This is my first time seeing him.
Don't touch that. You'll rip it!
You came all the way for that American-made stuff?
Are you joking? Interesting things were caught on this camera.
Amazing. I can't believe you're Korean with the balls you've got on you.
I told you not to film.
I know… REPORT ON KEY FIGURES …what you did last summer.
Hey.
What's that?
Are you guys insane?
What on earth did you do over there?
You used to make illegal deals in Dongducheon,
and you got an illegal job abroad transporting dangerous goods.
Violated the Foreign Exchange Control Act.
You put the money you made in Saudi Arabia into your mother's bank account in the US.
Your mother is also in my file for currency fraud.
You came all the way here just to arrest me for something like that? A noble prosecutor like you?
Making money abroad? Fine. Smuggling it into the country? Illegal.
11 YEARS IN JAIL
Fixing a bbangkku? Fine. But customizing the vehicle? Illegal.
FIVE YEARS IN JAIL
Driving a taxi? Great. But if it's unlicensed? Illegal.
EIGHT YEARS IN JAIL
Flirting with ladies? Fine. But breaking their hearts? Illegal.
3000 HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE
As for you,
having the wrong kind of older siblings is illegal.
BAD FAMILY? THREE YEARS OF REPENTING
What on earth are you doing?
Dong-wook, don't mess with me.
At this rate, you'll never make it to the US.
If I proceed with this,
you'll be banned from leaving this country and will be arrested immediately.
You'll get a longer sentence as a repeat offender.
A visa? You won't even get a glimpse of it.
I'm sorry, but I'll send the money to the national treasury. No, just kidding. I came all the way here instead.
Don't you think you're wasting your talents?
You know what I mean?
Living like an outlaw is like moonwalking.
You keep going backward.
Hey.
You're a fan of Knight Rider too?
That show has this great quote.
So, what?
Who the hell are you?
Who am I?
The one who'll get you to America.
Do some business with me.
When it's done, I'll let you go without question.
To the US.
Seriously…
Do you want us to become spies for you?
Park Dong-wook, you're all grown-up now.
You're smarter now.
Why don't you remove these first?
Then I'll listen to you.
Let's look at our first target.
Kang In-sook, the president of the loan shark industry. Number two in Korea.
Lee Hyeon-gyun, a former major in the Defense Security Command.
Now, he's Kang's sidekick.
They manage the former government's secret fund.
They're the worst.
Recently, the mules who used to work for them were all caught.
So they'll be picking new drivers.
You need to go there and get the information I want.
So, you want to use us to arrest those two?
No.
Then what?
They are just a bonus. I want someone higher.
REPEATED DICTATORSHIP
No way.
That guy without any hair up here? Oh my.
You want to get the dictator, the massacre expert?
Anyway, we're just gonna be mules, right?
Right.
But you need to pass a secret test to become their drivers.
It won't be easy.
All the best drivers are going to be there.
The test is tomorrow.
Tomorrow? We don't even have cars.
Is a taxi allowed?
Say we pass the test, what then?
The Saudi Arabia problem will be resolved.
If you find proof like the secret accounting ledger,
I'll eliminate your criminal records.
A clean slate.
Am I supposed to believe this?
Forgive our crimes?
You want it in writing?
That's not enough.
What?
If we pass the test and get visas for all of these guys,
If we pass the test and get visas for all of these guys, then I'll believe you.
Deal.
Are we clear?
Right, John.
You'll be DJing in this plan.
Just be ready for my instructions.
What "instructions"?
-Just be quiet. -Okay.
Take some pictures with this.
I want to donate it to the history museum later.
I'll leave the tool here.
It's new, so be careful with it.
Your tax money paid for it, okay?
What's he talking about? We never paid taxes.
I've been paying taxes recently.
How is that possible?
Just like I thought. Mules from all over the country are here.
They're all going to be desperate to get some fame from this job.
JUNG-GU INTERIOR MAP Exchange your movie ticket for a film container and deliver it.
Exchange your movie ticket for a film container and deliver it.
You'll leave Daehan Cinema, and your destination is Namsan Hotel.
You pick the route.
Jeez, you're so slow.
You'll be working all night.
Get lost.
You're no help, damn it.
You have ten minutes, but you might get into an accident.
-Let's win. -We can do it.
Yeah.
I could've carried it all, but they're heavy.
No one's going to marry you.
I don't care if you get hurt, but don't damage the car.
There'll be some brawls too.
You'll be on public roads, and it'll be dangerous as hell.
Do you ever shut up?
What, punk?
Damn.
DJ Moon Knight, how is it going?
Hey, Dong-wook,
I'm no longer a DJ.
Then what are you?
S-P-Y. I'm a spy.
LARGE BBANGKKU
Director.
He is in the sauna.
-So? -Why don't you see him when he's done?
A morning sauna is bad for you.
Bullshit.
Come into the bath.
It took me two hours to do my hair and makeup this morning.
Sweating in here helps clear your mind. Everything becomes clear.
I'm going to select new drivers today.
Make it quick.
They'll start attacking us right after the Olympics.
We made him the president. How can he stab us in the back?
That's how it works around here.
To be honest…
it's getting on my nerves.
it's getting on my nerves. It's basically a premium.
Don't you agree?
A premium? Please.
This country isn't some convenience store.
Anyway, he might seem soft,
but he's got some aspirations.
He'll try to act like the boss now, so prepare yourself.
After the opening ceremony,
you should rest somewhere that has great views.
I'm leaving.
Don't sell illegal tickets here!
It's a beauty with an air dam!
Look at those modifications.
Wow! A BMW!
Hey, there's an M5 too.
M5? I know about it.
M5 is great.
But an M5 can't beat a Grandeur.
Galchi's here too!
What does he think he's doing here?
Oh my. This thing is almost on fire.
Hey, Galchi, I never thought I'd be glad to see you.
Thanks to you, we won't come in last.
John made this mixtape just for our drive today.
I don't like his taste in music lately.
You know what John said?
He said he's the Saint Paul of Korean hip-hop.
Don't make me laugh.
He's just listened to some music. That's all.
Saint Paul was a scholar.
And John went to college, so don't doubt him.
We'll never be like him.
Joon-gi, do you really need that water tank?
Just focus on navigating.
The bigger the engine, the bigger the cooling water tank.
Oh, really?
Robocop!
Top Gun!
Dirty Dancing!
Two Moon Junction.
La Bamba!
There's no time for this. Anybody for La Bamba?
Here, La Bamba.
Those bastards.
Here goes the safe drivers' navigation guide.
Turn right in 500 meters. The curve is at two o'clock.
Dong-wook, watch out!
These assholes are no joke.
Joon-gi, start pumping.
Jeez.
Damn.
Well done, Park Dong-wook!
Look out!
Hold on!
Where do we go now, Bok-nam?
Chungmu University is this way.
-Should I go in? -Just wait a second.
Go! What's the worst that could happen?
Who are they?
They're cops. Fucking pigs.
OUR SENIORS AREN'T COMING BACK
Hey, arrest them. Come here!
On your left, Galchi!
Hey!
Park Dong-wook!
Stop getting in my way, you son of a bitch!
Red Galchi, out!
-Dong-wook. -Damn.
Shit! That Galchi bastard.
Dong-wook.
Doesn't that motorcycle look familiar?
Hello, sir.
Please cooperate with traffic control for the Olympics.
What's she doing?
When did she become a cop?
Damn it.
Suck on that!
That's my Dong-wook!
Give me one too.
I'm going up first. Make sure to get rid of the cops.
Yes, sir.
Where is it?
La Bamba!
-We're here! -Right.
Have fun watching it.
Which way? Come on.
Hey, what are you doing?
What's up with…
He's really sensitive.
Hey.
What? Not gonna feel me up too?
You dumbass.
Okay.
Congratulations.
You must be the winner. Well, yes.
Are you a team?
As you can see, yes.
You've got good style.
What a fun team.
This way.
She has a very intimidating vibe.
Are you scared?
No way. I've got a black belt.
You brought my favorite one.
Did we do all that shit just for that?
Jackson is art.
Sorry I'm late.
Hey.
Have you even been in the army?
You see,
we're bunkmates and drivers in the army.
And you?
Director Lee,
he's obviously a kid.
Men from the army are trustworthy.
Now, you'll get your job assignments from Director Lee.
As you can see, he's a bit uptight,
but bear with him.
We'll be fine, ma'am.
Let me tell you the rules first.
One, do not touch the goods.
Two, do not tell anybody where the goods are from.
Three, we're complete strangers.
You'll be making ten deliveries.
You'll get paid ten million won for each delivery.
Ten million…
Per delivery?
100 million in total.
-If you need anything-- -The money isn't enough.
-Not enough? -Are you insane?
We don't even know what we're delivering. A hundred million isn't enough.
That's what I'm saying.
-That makes sense. -Right.
You've got guts.
I don't stop stepping on the accelerator until I go all the way.
You should go all the way.
For the first five deliveries, ten million per delivery, like always.
Ten million per person for the rest.
And 40 million per delivery. Good?
Not bad.
But you need to show me that you're worth the money.
Once we start working, there's no turning back.
Let's have some fun now.
-You guys are disgusting -I think we're fucked.
That guy will throw a fit because we fucked up the Sonata.
Just get him a new one. No big deal.
How much can we get paid?
What?
Where do you think you are?
You have a huge task ahead of you. Wake up!
On the ground!
Seriously?
Yes, sir.
Am I wrong?
-Are you crazy, you geezer? -This isn't a joke.
You really hit the booze
just because President Kang told you to have fun?
Are you a thug?
Watch your mouth. I'll blow your head off.
Dong-wook.
Well, what now?
I need a car for this job.
That's why you need to get a faster car.
That's your second test.
If you've had enough fun, get lost. Dismissed!
He burned the car?
Yes, he did.
The camcorder got burned too.
Lee Hyeon-gyun, that crazy military nut. He really is insane.
Well, be careful, all of you.
Will the car be ready soon?
Pretty amazing, isn't it?
These were from the treasury. Take a look around.
Holy moly!
This is a BMW!
Oh my, it's a Porsche!
I can't believe they were in Korea.
This is paradise.
I need nothing but this one.
Come on, Bok-nam!
I'm the engineer, so I should pick the car!
All of you, stop.
That's enough.
Stop looking, or it'll spoil you.
Come over here.
What's he saying?
What are these pieces of garbage?
They're yours.
This is from precious tax money.
Pick among these.
Or you can just drive the one that I give you.
What's up with you?
Your youngest nephew's first birthday party is today.
Why are you still at work?
You still haven't gotten married. Don't work too hard.
And don't forget your home.
All right. Stop nagging me.
Just get to the point.
If you're trying to take the former government's pocket money,
If you're trying to take the former government's pocket money, you might be taken instead.
It'll work.
If it doesn't, I'll make it work.
And it's not "pocket money." It's their secret fund.
They're trying to launder money and run away with it under the new regime.
How can I let them do that?
I'd like to see them try laundering that money in a washing machine.
The dirt will never get washed away.
What about Director Lee's lackeys you caught? Anything from them?
They're all from Squad 606. Spies sent to North Korea.
Starting my plan B with the drivers
will be faster than waiting for them to talk.
You mean an illegal taxi driver and some smugglers in Saudi Arabia?
And what's that?
-They're all strays. -That's why they're perfect.
The military, police, or prosecutors, nobody knows them.
-How perfect is that? -Hey.
You know that I work for the president. He does nothing about this
because his opponents are tough.
The blame might fall on you.
I've already started it. I might as well go all in.
I never know what you're thinking.
I'm done here.
You're on your own from now on.
It's unofficial.
A secret investigation.
Okay?
You're even worse than Kim Il-sung.
If you're done picking your car, go get ready.
Look at the condition of this car.
What are we supposed to do with this?
You punk. That's why you're here. Figure it out yourselves.
We'll give up on getting a foreign car. Give us an extra car instead.
You're the only driver. Why do you need three cars?
Jeez.
We need at least three cars--
Rule number four.
Do not ask questions about our methods.
Rule number four?
What are the others?
Anyway, give us one more car.
That Grandeur. Wait, there's a Grandeur here?
I didn't see it either.
It's right here!
No.
-There's no Grandeur. -Let's go.
Why not? You told us to pick one.
Well, we don't have a Grandeur in here.
Isn't that a Grandeur?
Hey…
That's…
That's my car.
Not a chance.
Damn, that's a new car.
Move your smelly feet!
Come on!
What kind of girl smells this bad?
Come on. Get out, Dong-wook.
Get out!
I'm dying here. Joon-gi. Come on, get out.
Hello, sir.
Joon-gi, what a sharp tailbone you have.
Are you all going in together?
Why?
Do you always have to stick together? It's noisy.
Yes.
Let's go.
Are we that noisy?
Don't be too surprised.
Here!
How much is that?
Around five billion won?
-Probably a bit more than that. -Five billion?
Not 500 won? Oh, I'm sorry.
It's not that much, so you should be able to get the job done quickly.
All you need to do is take this money and buy me what I want.
Simple, right?
THE DELIVERY PLAN
Let's go.
First, the outer part will be the Pony pick-up so that it'll look cool.
It's going down.
The engine's from the Grandeur, with 130 horsepower.
The suspension and seats are from the Concord.
We'll combine three cars into one.
In order for the three of us to be in the car,
we'll upgrade the Pony into the one with three seats.
I've always wanted to do this.
The color should be black, of course.
Good job.
Inch up the tires.
Lower the body of the car.
The handle will be a D-curve.
Make it fast and accurate. Drift the car with this rhythm, with this vibe.
Drift the car with this rhythm, with this vibe.
Let's roll.
Get back safely. Good luck!
We got this!
SEOUL STATION
Start your deliveries today.
You must never be late.
When you complete your missions, you'll get a stamp per delivery.
WELL DONE!
NAMDAEMUN
Each time you get five stamps, the president will give you a bonus.
-We got another stamp? -Nice.
HAN RIVER
Thank you.
Good night, sir.
NO DRUNK DRIVING
One apple, one grape. EULJIRO
Dong-wook! Hurry!
-What the… -Freeze!
Get up!
Stop right there!
-Hey! -Cops!
Do you want to die? Come here!
That's why you were followed. Do you want to stand out that badly?
Why are you making such a fuss?
Aren't you ashamed?
I'm not.
That's right.
Wherever we go, the cops find us right away.
That guy, Director Lee, bothers me too. So annoying.
Lee Hyeon-gyun doesn't trust you. That's all. The higher-ups sent the police.
The new resident of the house with the blue roof is after the former one.
He wants him to cough up the money he stole.
You guys are snatching the money before he gets to it.
-Who owns the house with the blue roof? -Gosh.
Just eat.
Right, I saw them take out something else from the boxes they got other than the stuffed tigers.
There was also a hidden room in the penthouse.
A hidden room?
The accounting ledger is probably there.
Kang is meticulous.
You see, the president's into me.
I'll look into it.
Just keep an eye on them.
Don't do anything stupid. You'll get hurt.
I'll make some drinks for you too.
-How many deliveries are left? -We're almost done.
-We have a couple more. -Why would you pour soju in the beer?
I hope that the rest of your deliveries go smoothly.
Drink up.
This is called "so-beer." I came up with it. So good.
BONUS
We got a bonus!
Hey, what are you doing?
Look at this.
Not bad.
Okay, good!
-Wait! -Hey!
Move, you asshole!
-Okay! -Bring it on!
You're looking happy lately. Are things going well?
Is it that obvious? I get paid ten times more than before.
Ms. President would make me a chaebol.
The best job ever.
"Ms. President"? You're basically her lapdog now, aren't you?
I'm scum, right? I used to talk about justice in school.
You've never been to the US. What's with the English?
It's like you're an American immigrant.
Appearance is what matters.
Faith, hope, love, and appearances.
I can tell you studied theology.
I've been blessed.
Lord, hallelujah!
How much do you think that apartment costs?
They say 100 million won on TV.
That's expensive as hell. It doesn't even look cool.
No, It looks cool.
Aren't you going? You'll get caught.
I was about to leave.
I have plans in Apgujeong.
Is it a date?
Is it that girl from before?
Are you psychic?
Lord, amen. I'm leaving.
Jeez.
What? Who is it this time?
Why did you buy those ugly glasses?
Ugly?
-What's that? -It looks good on you.
That's…
Look at this, Joon-gi.
-It's a Mercedes-Benz! -It has two windshield wipers!
-Look at the tires. -So cool!
-Look at this paint, Joon-gi. -It's something else.
Why is this window so dark?
Oh my! Ms. President, long time no see.
You all look cooler.
Of course we do. We're great.
You're all getting a gift today, and I prepared something for you.
-I hope you'll like it. -A gift!
You can get it from my secretary.
-What does she have there? Is that a bag? -What is it?
I'll see you later.
-Goodbye. -Take care.
Drive safe.
Mercedes-Benz is great.
-An envelope? -Why is she…
What's this?
Real estate purchase contract? Apartment?
Wait, is this…
Yes, it's your bonus.
Where is this apartment?
We saw it before!
This is crazy!
Dong-wook, we're successful!
That's like the Los Angeles and Beverly Hills of Korea.
Right?
This place has two bathrooms!
One of them is mine!
I don't think we need to go to LA.
Here's your key and some money.
Since you're off duty today, enjoy yourselves.
Apgujeong!
Joon-gi!
How many zeros are there?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
100 million won!
Step on it, Dong-wook!
Faster!
MBC CAMERA RAID
We're in front of a club in Itaewon.
It's past midnight.
This place is an entertainment district with over 280 neon signs.
Why are you acting like this?
Because this asshole hit me first!
He hit me first!
These men are causing a huge public disturbance.
-Please go home. -Hey!
-Fuck, did you hit me? -It wasn't me.
I tried to stop them…
Nobody's stepping in.
-Asshole! -Please stop. You'll get hurt.
They look stupid, all drunk and fighting like that.
Let go of me.
You need to control yourself sometimes.
-Let me go. -Stop fighting!
Your clothes are too revealing. Don't you care what others think?
Not at all. I don't care.
I wear whatever I want to.
Because I'm worth it.
All right.
I'm Ji Pyeong-hwan, reporting for MBC Camera Raid.
You put your face in front of the camera?
Are you all insane? Stay on your toes!
Today in Insa-dong…
This should be a family heirloom! What an honor!
We made it onto the news.
Joon-gi, you have a healthy liver.
I'm suffering over here.
OLYMPIC LIVE BROADCAST WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER
What's that?
That's SoBangCha! Let's go see them!
Let's go see SoBangCha!
Bok-nam, can we go see SoBangCha? Please?
I'll give you a ride.
What SoBangCha? You're making me nauseous. I'm still hungover. I'm not going.
CAST - PART TWO Lee Sang-eun.
That song, "Damdadi" by Lee Sang-eun.
"Damdadi." Aren't you going?
Don't be ridiculous!
Haven't you started your motorcycle yet?
-Oh, should I? -Let's go.
-Get the helmet. -The delivery's at three.
-Yeah. -Don't get caught on camera!
Don't encourage her.
They're together. I'm sure they're fine.
You get both duties today. Come sit up front.
We're going to be late.
Is he an amateur? Damn.
Watch out!
Shoot!
Aren't you going to greet your superior?
-What? -Freaking hell.
Such bad manners.
I'll fix that today, for sure.
-Shit. -Come here.
-What are you doing? -Oh, I'm so scared.
Your eyes almost popped out.
All of this is just a joke to you. Isn't it?
All right, who wants to pick?
How about you?
What are you saying, you fucking psycho?
Dong-wook!
What did you do when you met?
Do what, you crazy son of a bitch?
Meet up with whom? And do what?
You really thought I wouldn't find out?
Start talking on three, or I'll blow your little sister's head off. One.
We didn't meet with anybody!
Director,
no, big brother. Why are you doing this?
We don't know anything, I swear.
Stop fucking around and put that gun away!
Two.
Hey, shoot me instead. Kill me, you crazy asshole!
Just kill me!
Fine.
-No, Dong-wook! -Dong-wook!
Any last words?
Three.
Hey, did I scare you?
You totally got scared.
I'm not killing you, you dumbasses.
I was just playing around.
Stop glaring at me.
You've passed the test!
Real men know how to keep a secret.
Since you passed the test, I'll give you a gift. THE 12TH PRESIDENT
And
don't be too cocky thinking President Kang's got your back.
If you try to mess with the general's business, I'll kill you.
You'll all get a bullet to the head!
So stay on your toes! Understood?
The police caught one of the smugglers.
What a useless piece of shit.
Before any information leaks,
take care of the money left in the safe.
Ms. Yoon-jae.
No party today?
I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you.
It was canceled.
You don't need to be sorry.
Have you had dinner?
Why did she call us for a golf game in the middle of the night?
Isn't this nice though?
Mr. Lee, which sport were you in charge of?
Probably wrestling.
You can watch sports on TV. Why would they make you do all that? How annoying.
Oh my.
There's Ms. Kang.
Were you having fun?
We've just been here waiting for you, Ms. Kang.
Oh, stop it, Mr. Lee. Ms. Kang,
things have been a bit tense lately with those tax audits and all.
Right, the tax audits.
If you don't like the tax audits, make sure to get a lot of gold medals.
Remember what the general said?
If you get good results in the Olympics, he won't do tax audits.
We don't know if the next big man will keep that promise.
I should've gone to the Korea Military Academy too.
You're joking.
You're being such crybabies.
You know that the general would never steal from someone else's pockets.
Your donations won't be used anywhere else.
We're going to use that money for the new foundation.
Now, it's almost time for the general to arrive.
So let's wrap things up here.
I called the Public Prosecutor General here today.
You put something like this on your arm.
Have you played around before?
I wish.
It's a mark.
A wound of glory.
Well, she doesn't give this mark to just anybody.
Do you mean Ms. Kang?
This is a bit harsh.
She's a scary woman.
That's why even the general won't mess with her.
So, are we dead meat if we get caught doing this?
Don't even joke about that.
We'd really get in trouble.
I'll go shower first.
I sent my boys to check on the car repair center.
There were no listening devices.
That's it. We're out.
You guys knew it wouldn't be that easy.
I agreed to be a mule, nothing more, nothing less.
You keep changing things.
You gave me a lot of information.
If John brings the key--
Do you think John is a spy or something?
As you know, if we get the key, the accounting ledger will be ours.
Screw the accounting ledger. John could die!
Listen, Dong-wook.
Let's take some time to think this over from the start.
Aren't you going to the US?
Have you forgotten our deal already?
Besides,
if I wanted to, I could send you all to prison. Forget about the United States.
You can do whatever you want to do.
I'm out.
Park Dong-wook!
Don't you want to know how corrupt things happen in your country?
The reason why I'm trying so fucking hard to put that piece-of-shit dictator in jail?
Aren't you curious?
The US and cars. That's all you think about.
Vain, thoughtless bastards like you are the reason why
those assholes treat citizens like shit and live high on the hog, you moron!
That money you're delivering
was made from the blood and sweat of people like us.
If we fail, those assholes will take everything.
How are you going to deal with that?
I didn't know you cared so much about justice.
I'm sorry.
I only care about myself.
The things you talk about, like justice, love for the country,
I put myself first before any of that crap.
And the reason why I want to go to the US is…
not because I'm vain. It's because of my dream.
Keys in my pocket, John in the house
What's up, Joon-gi?
What's the matter?
Did someone die?
Bok-nam.
Why is he so quiet? Is he sick?
That damn "Damdadi."
What did we do wrong? We didn't know what would happen.
What's going on?
Damn.
Well, a few hours ago…
Never mind.
Why did you come back so early?
Bbangkku spy. Mission complete. My name is Bond, John Bond.
Is this it? Really?
Did you really get it?
You did all the hard work.
Made by Joon-gi.
This is it.
We can get all those sons of bitches with this.
Let's hit Director Lee in the back of his head!
Dong-wook should know that I made it. Where is he?
Dong-wook is in the office. He's packing.
"Packing"?
What do you mean?
Dong-wook, what are you doing?
A friend from Saudi Arabia told me that he'll get me a ship.
I'm leaving this country with everyone.
And go where?
Didn't you hear what happened earlier?
I did.
But they're fine now. Director Lee is fucking crazy. That's all.
Someone could have died, asshole.
Yoon-hee, Bok-nam, and everyone, you dumbass!
Hey, no need to get so mad.
Dong-wook,
I got the key. Once we get the accounting ledger, we're done.
Are you insane?
Do you think you've actually become a spy or something?
Get real, John.
Hey.
I put my life on the line doing this.
You think I don't care?
What if things go wrong? Will you take responsibility?
How can you say that after hearing what happened?
I'll leave as soon as possible. All this has been too much from the start.
"Too much" my ass!
You feel good about running away again? Last time, Saudi Arabia. Where are you gonna go now?
He said he'll forgive our crimes. And the visas? He told us we can get them.
Do you still trust Prosecutor Ahn?
Forgive our crimes? Visas?
That's all just bait, you dumbass.
You're such a fucking coward.
Do you have to blame the prosecutor? Nobody forced you into this.
You've all known what we were going to do, am I wrong?
We can do it. No, we're the only ones who can do it, so why not?
Do you really want to quit now and be a lowlife scum forever?
All you have is your appearance. Who are you calling a scum?
Shit.
Dong-wook.
When you're racing, where are you looking?
What the hell are you asking?
Never mind.
Yeah, let's stop here.
GIFTED FROM THE 12TH PRESIDENT
Is this--
-Over there. -Oh, here?
Hello there.
Sir.
Good work.
-All you need is the accounting ledger. -No.
You guys are done too.
I don't think you can get the accounting ledger.
Who else is gonna do it?
You don't trust us after all you've made us do?
It's not that.
Haven't you talked to Dong-wook?
I didn't expect them to go crazy like--
I really have no idea what's on your mind.
Why so serious all of a sudden?
I'm fine. We're fine.
Yes, we are.
Director Lee might be crazy, but he's nothing compared to Yoon-hee.
She's a lot crazier.
Hey!
Director Lee, that damn military nut.
How dare that military nut do that to us?
See?
We can't live like lowlifes. We have our pride.
I know you don't have anybody else for the job, so just tell us what to do.
Yeah, it doesn't feel right.
You idiots.
You sure you can do this?
Don't worry.
Normal people like us are perfect for jobs like this.
Nobody will notice who screwed over those assholes.
Right?
All right!
You see, I'm a very skilled black belt.
-With one blow, I could knock him… -He's lying again.
Right.
You can have your baby back.
The athletes are entering the country to compete in the Seoul Olympics, the big global festival.
to compete in the Seoul Olympics, the big global festival. They look bright and strong, just like our fall weather.
President Kang will leave the hotel briefly for an event.
Seems like she's on edge, adding more security guards. You need to sneak in and out as quickly as you can.
I forgot something.
-Will the president be late? -Maybe, since she's at the event.
Darn, today's my wife's birthday.
-What's wrong with this? -Hey, turn it down!
Yes, sir.
This thing is not working.
Hey, move over.
What's wrong with this?
Turn it off already.
-Man, it's on again. -Fuck.
Manager.
The master key in my cabinet…
-Search everywhere. -Yes, ma'am.
Just unplug it. Wait, stop unplugging it like that…
Oh, the music finally turned off!
-You scared me! Bastard! -What?
You're dead meat.
-What? -Kang.
-What did you say? -President Kang!
-What? -Go back over there.
-Okay. -I'm going.
Hello.
Good times.
You're at the age when nothing scares you. I'll see you later.
Yes, Ms. Kang. Goodbye.
There!
Hey! Stop!
Damn it!
Seriously! You scared the hell out of me!
What kind of hell is that?
Damn you.
How did you know I was here? Did you ask the prosecutor?
Since you all left without me, I knew you'd be doing this.
Anyway, this is really the end.
Let's hand over the accounting ledger, get our visas, and go to LA.
By the way, your makeup…
Do something about that before going to LA--
-It's not makeup. -I'm going to crash.
It's a disguise.
You'd better wear a mask.
-Say one more thing… -We're going to crash.
-…and your mouth will be-- -Hey, stop it!
Where will you go now?
He said he'll forgive our crimes. And a visa? He told us we can get them.
Do you still trust Prosecutor Ahn?
Forgive our crimes? A visa?
That's all just bait, you dumbass.
What are you doing?
I'm telling you that you've been stabbed in the back.
Stop making a fuss.
Let's talk about this slowly and quietly.
Those delivery guys, they're minions for the prosecutor's office!
So?
They've ruined the general's plans!
Those commies have taken the accounting ledger too!
I'll catch those assholes and kill them!
All of this happened because you were too soft on them!
I'm going to report this to the general immediately.
He won't be happy with this! You get it?
Director Lee.
No,
Hyeon-gyun.
If you want to bark at the person taking care of you,
keep your voice down first, you military nut son of a bitch!
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Get out.
Secretary Kim.
Yes, ma'am.
Go to Myeongdong and prepare to exchange the money in the temple for US bills.
It'll be easier to carry it if it's lighter.
Yes, ma'am.
Yoon-jae.
Yes, Ms. Kang.
Wait to eat dinner.
When you get back, we can eat together.
Yes, ma'am.
They're here.
-You dirty traitors! -Are you okay?
Does loyalty mean nothing to you? How could you just leave me?
What? I was going to come back for you.
-I'll kill you! -Hey.
You're dead meat! Come here!
Come over here!
You're making a cool entrance at the very end.
Why are you back?
I'll take that as a thank-you.
What happened here?
Hey.
-Is this the right place? -Yeah.
This is Prosecutor Ahn's desk.
What on earth happened?
Hey, look at this.
These are our visas.
Let's get out. Hurry.
Hey, wait.
I think that is Prosecutor Ahn's voice.
Hey, go to the car.
You go and start the car. I'll be back after a quick look.
Go…
Take it and go. Quick.
Dong-wook!
-Dong-wook! -Get that asshole!
-Get him! Quickly! -Start the car now!
-Stop right there! -Dong-wook!
-Dong-wook! -Stay still!
Run, you moron!
Open the door!
-You son of a bitch… -Dong-wook!
Open the door, bastard!
Go, you idiot!
Get him!
It's Dad's ignition switch.
Dong-wook, what should we do now?
Director Lee, that son of a bitch.
We need to get going.
We can't stay here long. Let's go find John.
Yeah. Let's go.
You son of a bitch.
That's enough, Director Lee.
We don't have time for this.
You know, people can endure so much pain sometimes.
Unwrap it and show it to him.
Mr. DJ, what do you think this is?
Take a look.
You know this hand, don't you?
What did you do to her?
Losing a hand won't kill you.
Fuck! You call yourselves human beings?
Oh my. I guess our poor DJ here liked Secretary Kim a lot.
Still, love is just love. You should put your own life first, right?
Where's the accounting ledger?
Fuck you.
Go fuck yourself!
Wake him up.
Let's stop. I don't think he's gonna talk.
You can come in.
How did you--
We won't get anything from a run-of-the-mill prosecutor.
I talked to the Public Prosecutor General to get them out,
so let's take care of the money that's left and the goods.
Dong-wook, it's news time!
-Yoon-hee. -Yes.
Call Mom until she picks up.
Hurry, Dong-wook!
He was beaten by the main suspects, Park Dong-wook and his gang.
After beating Prosecutor Ahn, Park Dong-wook and his gang pushed him out… What's that?
What's that? -Prosecutor Ahn fell on top of a car… -Is everyone dead?
-Prosecutor Ahn fell on top of a car… -Is everyone dead?
They're saying we did all that?
Wow! They think we did that?
Those assholes are crossing the line!
Fuck!
We're in front of the apartment…
Dong-wook, Mom's fine.
Bundles of cash worth one billion won, and around 300 artifacts were found in the master bedroom.
and around 300 artifacts were found in the master bedroom.
This apartment was under the name Park Yoon-hee, a woman who was confirmed to be their accomplice.
a woman who was confirmed to be their accomplice. She was confirmed to be the sister of Park Dong-wook.
The police are tracking the culprits they believe are still hiding in Seoul.
Despite frequent vehicle searches, they haven't been located yet.
The police are trying to arrest the culprits and recommend they turn themselves in before they are caught.
General Jeon, Public Prosecutor General, came all this way to our golf club.
Why don't you say a few words for us?
Yes, sure.
All of you, I won't forget your loyalty to your country.
You made this country a better place to live in.
Setting up the foundation isn't enough.
There will be a lot more things for us to collaborate on.
Why did you want to see me? To turn yourself in?
This is President Kang's accounting ledger.
And here is the location…
of the money and goods.
I'm sorry,
but this is out of my hands now.
The Prosecutor General is loyal to them.
Even with the original, there's nothing I can do.
I'm going to prove that we didn't do it. I'm going to reveal the real culprits.
I'm going to gather all the money that we've delivered, and everything left,
and destroy it all right in front of those bastards.
I won't let them have a single coin.
You'll need something more than some mediocre evidence.
And don't get any ideas.
Sir, I…
I don't even know if my friend is dead or alive!
No matter what, I'll do it.
You can do it your way.
What's this?
It was in Mr. Ahn's car.
The person who gave his life for that wouldn't have hesitated long.
Hey.
What are you going to do?
I need to see where they're going.
Stay here.
-What do you mean? Come back! -Dong-wook!
What are you going to do?
What on earth is his plan?
Dong-wook!
Where are you going, Dong-wook?
Seriously…
Only one left, right?
Yes. The ones already sent will be kept in the airport.
I'll send the rest during the opening ceremony.
The opening ceremony.
That's the perfect day to avoid drawing attention.
I'll see you then.
Yes, ma'am.
What?
Where did he go?
Hi-ya!
You have no idea how amazing I am.
Joon-gi, it's our turn. Are you ready?
I'm ready.
I found them.
Come out, you military nutjob!
You didn't get hit?
Boy, it's so hard to aim these things.
What is it?
-What? -Bring me John.
How touching. What if I don't want to?
You'll want to once you look at my cards.
What?
This is a terrible hand of cards.
And you're out?
Of course, I have a hidden card. Want to see it?
Go ahead. Show me.
I want John first.
Hey, get him.
John.
Oh my.
He's about to be a goner.
He should've stuck to playing in the DJ booth. He even played around with women.
You sons of bitches!
Shit.
Fuck, you really have no class.
That's the reason.
That's why you didn't notice your master abandoned you.
What did you just say?
Joon-gi.
Here.
This is the song of the day.
Sure.
All of you, I won't forget your loyalty to your country.
You made this country a better place to live in.
Setting up the foundation is not enough. There will be a lot more things…
What is this?
Keep listening.
Sir, if the foundation doesn't work out,
then who will be responsible?
That sounds like a question for me.
All the necessary preparations have been made.
Do you remember Director Lee?
This is perfect timing for an ad break, isn't it?
Shut up and keep playing it!
He loves to sacrifice himself.
That's right.
He's a bit dumb because he never went to the Military Academy.
But he knows how to take some hits.
So there's no need to worry.
Bring me that right now.
Fuck! Is this damn thing all you have?
You fuckers! Who do you think I am?
I'll fucking kill you!
You broke it. It doesn't matter anyway.
I can get you 100 copies of it if you'd like.
Someone's probably making more copies.
Director Lee…
to those assholes,
you're just a mutt.
Are you going to run with your tail between your legs after you gave them the money?
What the fuck did you say?
Do you think the prosecutor you killed
was working by himself?
The prosecutors will be here any minute.
So?
I'm saying that I'll help you.
You?
Help me?
Just give me the location, and I'll make the delivery for you.
Don't you know?
I'm the best driver around here.
So, you want me to betray the general?
Just give me a billion won.
Or you could take all the blame and go to jail. You're good at taking hits.
You little…
If you are messing with me, I'm really going to kill you.
This time my boys will be in the car too.
Tell them to grab motion sickness meds.
It'll be shaky as hell in there.
Good boy.
You're so handsome. Who do you take after?
Me.
You're handsome like me, right?
So cute.
Hey, Mom!
I told you not to put that here!
This is the best spot to dry these.
Then move your car somewhere else!
The peppers will make my car even hotter!
Bullshit.
Auntie, Dong-wook's here.
My goodness.
-Auntie. -Hey!
What do you think you're doing here?
How dare you come here? Get lost!
Hee-young, he's your friend!
-Auntie! -Dong-wook!
-Auntie! -Joon-gi!
-Welcome. -Damn it.
-Have you eaten yet? -Yes, ma'am.
Right.
I'm sorry for what happened to Bbangkku. It's all just a tragedy.
My mother says hello from America.
I was about to send her a letter.
By the way, Auntie,
could you…
let us use this place?
What?
Why?
No.
Of course. You can use it all you want.
Use whatever you need.
Mom!
You know Bbangkku is our rival! How could you do that?
Wear proper clothes. Isn't there anything other than those tank tops?
-It's supposed to be cool! -Cool?
You don't even buy me any clothes. This is called fashion!
Bullshit.
Wait here. I'll set your table.
Yes, ma'am.
No.
Not a chance.
No.
I really wanted to keep it, but…
Air Jordan 3, limited edition.
Jordan 3?
Limited edition?
Just one day.
You get one day.
Deal.
Our D-Day is the opening ceremony.
I'll move the bundles of money and the goods in the safe together.
My destination is the Port of Incheon.
Director Lee seems to be planning to run off with the goods.
Our priority is John.
Once we know that John is safe, we'll make our move.
What about the car? Will the one we have work?
I'll make it work. We'll do it our way.
-One… -Two, three!
Come on!
We're doing it Olympic-style this time.
You're preparing as we planned, right?
The tapes are ready.
The recording is ready.
I'll be sure to fill in the empty spot left by John.
Here.
88 SEOUL VIBE Remember this.
Joon-gi, you've got Hangang Park. Bok-nam, take the Olympic-daero.
Galchi, you've got the parade at the main stadium. Yoon-hee, take the airport.
It's Seongnam, not Gimpo.
We're going to get all of them in one picture.
No matter what, we'll drag them down with us.
Let's be fucking annoying.
-Here! -Bravo!
It's John's.
I worked on it for a bit.
Are these pop songs?
Listen to all the hip-hop you want when you go to LA.
-Take this with you today. -You know what to do, right?
When you get the call later, make sure to pick--
Jeez.
Get out of my way.
Hey.
How come I've only got you weirdos?
This is the Seoul Vibe Plan, sir.
"Seoul Vibe."
Make sure to tell Dong-wook I've also put my life on the line.
All right, go.
You're making me dizzy. Leave.
The commoners will unite against the authority!
What a loud appearance.
Look at this car.
Load the car. I need to get going.
-Load it. -Yes, sir!
All right.
Let's do this.
Start the operation.
Breaking the barriers of ideology,
the 24th Olympics, a global festival for the world's population, is held in Seoul.
Brother.
Hallelujah.
It's good to see you, Sister Saint.
Yoon-hee, give me that flower pot over there.
After the host country for the Olympics was decided
on September 30th, 1981, in Baden-Baden, the whole country prepared
for the Seoul Olympics for seven years.
13,626 athletes from 160 countries around the globe are in attendance…
I'll miss this damn country.
What's that?
What? Shit!
Let's go!
Get that bastard!
Shit.
Stop the car, you bastard!
I said, stop the car, asshole!
No way!
Dong-wook!
I'll block them all for you! Okay?
Shit.
You're not going anywhere, asshole.
Where are you going, you son of a bitch?
Damn.
Shit.
Where the hell is Galchi?
When you go to Los Angeles
Send me a letter
A letter with words of love
In it
Move.
Move, you damn tiger!
You morons, are you sure Park Dong-wook is here?
Hey!
I've never worn those for a reason!
Why would you wear them?
What do you care? They're mine! I can do whatever I want!
-Take those off. -No!
-Take them off! -No!
Right now!
Damn it.
There!
I've found them on the other side.
Take them off!
Get in there and grab them!
Hey, move!
-I said move! -Stop.
Hey.
Stop messing around. Blast them already!
-No. -What?
Move!
Call me "big brother."

What the fuck is that?
A letter full of words of love…
And what's that?
That's right. Everyone follow me.
Man, I'm injured too.
I should be the one being helped.
John, I would've become a roasted chicken if it wasn't for you.
You totally got scared.
This isn't a movie. A car doesn't blow up that easily.
Fuck.
Wow.
We almost got fucked.
Fuck.
Shit!
Go! Don't let him escape!
SOUTH SEOUL AIRPORT
Watch me, you little pricks.
This is the Seoul Vibe.
Get this out of my way, assholes!
Ms. Kang, we have a problem.
A problem? What is it?
You need to go now, ma'am.
The money is still on its way. What--
What are they doing?
He's become impatient.
Die, you commies!
Hey, Mr. Dictator's lackey, watch where you're shooting!
Die, you asshole!
Fuck you.
You fuckers.
That bald fucker!
You sons of bitches!
Let's go!
Shit.
John, can you do it?
What can I say?
Nothing's impossible in Korea.
Dong-wook, when you're racing, where are you looking?
Where am I looking?
What the hell?
Close the hatch!
You little…
How dare you come here?
Damn it.
I delivered everything for you.
Of course you did.
Who does that belong to?
Answer me, you asshole.
Who does it belong to?
Whose is it? Answer me!
Whose is it? It's mine!
Hey, old lady.
"Old lady"?
Yes, old lady.
You crazy piece of shit…
I hope you get to meet the bald guy in the history museum.
What?
I'm getting off here.
Fuck this. Give me the gun!
-President, we're in a plane. -Give me the gun, you moron!
You son of a bitch! Get him!
Yes, ma'am.
Open the door!
President!
Damn it.
Shit.

-Lift him. -Be careful.
Slowly.
Hey!
Su-hyeong, Gyu-hyeong, close your eyes.
Stop that, you prick.
Damn it! I thought you were dead!
I thought you wanted me to die.
Dong-wook, are you okay?
You're alive!
Why didn't you just die?
What's this? It's money!
Wow, it's money!

THE GUARDIAN OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA PROSECUTOR AHN PYEONG-WOOK
Man, this feels weird.
Is it really over?
I don't know. It doesn't feel real.
Why?
Do you wanna get the rest of the stamps?
-What's up with you? -Damn.
Hey, John Woo.
You should quit being a DJ. Come and work in the field.
No. Sweating like that is so not cool.
Just as I thought. We really don't click.
Damn.
Jeez.
Hee-young, I mean…
Galchi.
Good work.
You'll be so bored without me.
No way.
That's not true at all!
Sure it is.
Wait.
How are we gonna get to LA? Everything we've saved up got burned.
Well, I have no idea.
The way you're speaking is very suspicious.
Hey, what's there to be suspicious about?
What's that?
You really squirreled this away like a beggar?
-A beggar? -Yeah, you beggar.
You…
Bok-nam, I saw it all.
-Saw what? -This!
-What's this? -Wow, there's so much.
-What are you doing? -Strip him.
-Take his pants off. -What for?
What are you doing?
Wow.
You never disappoint, Dong-wook.
Damn.
We need an upgrade before we go to Los Angeles, right?
GANGWON
People come before money.
Not money…
but people…
What's that?
Coming!
Hold on.
Who the hell is it?
Why the fuck would you turn off the doorbell?
Where are your keys?
Anu!
Anu, my shirt's inside. Open up, please.
Anu.
Anu!
Make sure you don't crease the shirt.
Anu!
-Lucky's anything but lucky! -Yeah, okay. Bowl.
We need a wicket, Lucky!
What amazing weather! So good... Lovely!
Fielding.
Ahaan bowling.
What a pain!
Ignore him. Bowl.
Ball coming.
Ahaan. Six!
-Will you hit a six now? -Yes.
-Here, take the bat. -Wait...
Attitude!
Ready?
-Ready. -Shall I bowl?
-Yes. -Ahaan is ready. Here goes the bowler.
Ahaan hits a six!
-Wow! -There it goes.
-Where is it? -It's gone far.
-Very far! -It crossed the boundary.
-It's gone into the sea! -Gone into the sea!
Hari!
Hari!
Come on, let's go.
Hari!
Carry on, I'll join you.
-What is it? -Listen.
We're a fielder short. Come join the game.
Hey, Tinku!
Let's go!
And listen...
-Don't get him along. -What's happening?
Can't you hear?
Gayatri has been calling you for so long.
I was sweeping the balcony. I was just coming.
Go and get some cottage cheese.
-Now? -Yes, hurry up!
-Okay. -Don't wander around.
I'll be right back.
Ahaan, your breakfast.
Here, butter your toast.
I might be late tonight.
At least, have breakfast before you go.
Come.
Ahaan... You're done with breakfast, right?
Go, get ready.
Ranjit, the kids in the building are planning a picnic.
Get to the point, Gayatri.
I want Ahaan to join them.
We've discussed this enough times.
You know my reasons.
Why bring it up again?
I'll go for a picnic! I'll go for a picnic!
Ahaan. Go inside.
You know how those kids treat him, don't you?
The change will be good for him.
Please let him go, Ranjit.
Enjoy your breakfast.
Mom, I'll go picnic.
With friends!
Girlfriends! I'll go with friends.
Okay, fine.
Will you go give Ms. Anu those brownies?
It's over there. Okay.
-Who is it? -Sir, Abhijeet.
-Who Abhijeet? -Sir, doorstep banking.
-Hi, sir. -Come in.
Actually, sir...
Shoes, sir.
What's wrong with them?
No, sir. You'll ask me to take them off...
Okay.
Have a... Have a good day, sir.
Who is it?
Ahaan... Hi!
-Come on in. -Hi.
Hold it there, young man.
Do you roam about in shoes at home too?
Never mind. Ahaan, give me that.
-And take off your shoes there. -Yes, yes.
-Sit, I'll be right back. -Okay.
Here.
-Lovely juice! -I'm glad you like it.
So, how are you? You don't come to the park these days?
Yesterday... I came.
-I left early. -Oh, I didn't see you.
Here. For the brownies.
-Okay. I'll leave now. -Okay.
-Bye, Ahaan. -Yes, bye.
-See you later. -Yeah... okay.
Did you have to call him in?
You could've collected the box at the door.
You can treat people the way you like.
Please don't interfere in my matters.
Slowly.
Control the steering wheel, and carefully move ahead.
Eyes on the road and drive slow.
Hi, Mom. Where are you going?
Your Dad is getting an award tonight!
Oh, nice! I'll come and cheer for my Dad.
I know, son. But...
Let's see what mood he's in today.
Ahaan.
Dad's come.
Gayatri, hurry up. We need to leave.
Yeah. Nice.
Wow!
Hi, Mom! How do I look?
Very nice!
Ahaan wants to come along to cheer his Dad.
No, Mom...
Tinku and I will party at home!
Really?
Yay!
I want to get married.
My wife
My child. Two children.
One boy, one girl.
They'll have their birthdays...
Happy birthday to you!
Feed me cake too.
-My wife. -Okay.
She won't feed me?
-Wait. -Okay.
She'll give me mouth.
Here, sweetie, have cake.
Give me a kiss.
What work will you do?
Simple work. I'll do my own work.
Lovely, fun. Hey, come here?
Listen, get these photocopied.
Get these photocopied.
My passport.
My social security card.
PAN card.
Get copies made.
Okay. Secretary?
-Secretary. -Will it be a guy or a girl?
A girl.
You are upset because your dad
didn't take you along, right?
How can they do this?
They don't think of me.
They only think of themselves.
My wedding. I want to get married. Where will my wife stay?
I want to have my own house. My life.
-You want to live by yourself. -By myself.
You want the logo on the left, right?
Okay.
And the font size, a little bigger.
-Hi, Ahaan. -Hi.
-Brownies for you! -Thank You!
What's cooking?
I've made Chicken Biryani.
-Want to try some? -Chicken Biryani!
Come on in!
-Sit, I'll be right back. -Yes, yes.
-Here you go. -Biryani!
Wow, thank you.
-Superb Biryani. -Anu!
-Do you want more? -No, no.
Thank you. I'm on a diet!
Anu, where are you?
Can't you hear me? Who are you talking...
What the...
Is that food on the sofa?
-Ozzy... -Is that food?
-Ozzy, please relax. Just calm down. -Damn!
Just... It's okay.
Ahaan, don't worry about it.
-Eat some more. -No no, I'm dieting.
Ozzy! Hey, what the... What are you doing?
Stop it! Ahaan, it's okay.
Stop! What are you doing?
Ahaan, it's okay.
Please!
-What? -Will you just stop it now?
Anu.
This must not happen again.
Goddam, he was eating on my sofa!
You know how much I hate all this.
Let's have some discipline in this house!
-God! -You know how much it bothers me!
I've had enough.
I've had enough of this bullshit!
Your OCD...
Your obsession with everything,
cleanliness and sanitization, just drives me nuts!
Ozzy...
you need serious professional help.
Why? No...
-How many times- -No, tell me...
What's wrong with keeping the house clean?
And I just want things in a particular way.
That's it. How difficult it is for you to understand?
I can't do this anymore...
You need a bloody shrink, not me.
Angry all the bloody time.
Come on. You're being over-dramatic.
Keep it back.
Keep it back, dammit! Come on.
Anu, come on, stop it! Keep it back.
Don't overreact.
More than a wife...
I feel I'm here to serve you,
while you sit on that high horse of yours.
Anu, relax.
You don't want a child, because of this OCD of yours.
So that the house is not a mess!
We'll work on this. Okay, I promise you. Come on.
We'll work on this.
You need to work on yourself.
Anu, just wait.
Anu, stop. What are you doing?
-Let me go! -Anu!
Anu, relax! Anu!
Who are you waiting for?
Onella will be here soon.
-You're kidding! -I swear!
Please go.
I'll leave when she arrives.
I want to woo girls, man.
I know, buddy. Let her get here.
-I'll leave then. -Please go, man...
Ahaan!
-Hi. -Hi.
What are you doing here?
-Just killing time. -Yes, nothing, just chilling.
Where are you going?
Actually, I was looking for you.
-Look what I got you. -Oh, wow!
Amazing.
-Lovely. Halwa! -You like it, right?
Yes. I'll eat all of it!
Whenever you want to eat something, just call me, okay?
-I'll make it for you. -I will...
Are you going home?
No, I just need to give my husband something.
I'll drop it with the guard and then go home.
Home? Isn't your home here?
It is, but I'm at my dad's place these days.
-Okay, I should go now. -Bye.
Wait... Why are you taking the trouble?
Hari can help you.
-Yeah, of course. -Sure?
-Tinku is my good friend. -At your service!
-Please drop this upstairs. -Yes, I'll go.
Okay, thank you.
I will call you, okay? For...
Anytime.
-Bye. -Bye.
Go and give this. I won't.
Who is it?
Oh, God!
Ahaan. Spectacles.
Your spectacles.
Oh. Thank You.
-What's that? -It's Halwa. Gajar Halwa.
Did Anu send it for me? No... It's for me.
Ms. Anu gave it to me. It's for me.
-It's for you! -Yes.
-Are you sure? -Yes, sure.
Do you want to come in?
-Some orange juice, maybe? -Okay.
Come.
Take out your shoe...
You remember! Good. Sit.
Shall we sit at the table?
Come.
Sit.
Juice.
Thank you.
Nice.
Have you ever tried orange juice with Gajar Halwa?
What?
Yes... Tangy orange juice
with sweet Gajar Halwa.
Sweet and sour!
It's very tasty.
-Really? -Yes. Will you try it?
Okay.
Okay.
-I'll get you a plate. -Okay.
What are you doing?
-Playing games. -Keep it down.
Plate.
Mmm, lovely juice. It's so tasty.
I love it.
Actually,
I like it too.
Wan-wanna try?
No. You have it.
Okay.
But if you insist, I'll try some.
-Here. -No, I'll have it out of this.
-Nice, huh? -Nice, nice.
Try it?
No, I'm okay.
Yours. You have it. I'm okay.
Tell me something.
What else was Anu saying?
She said...
I can call her anytime.
She'll cook for me.
Chicken. Chicken Biryani.
Really?
So, when are you meeting Anu next?
Ms. Anu... Father's place.
Where is it? I don't know.
Listen.
I can take you to Anu.
-Are you sure? -Absolutely sure.
Here's what you do.
Call Anu
and tell her that you'll meet her tomorrow at noon.
With that servant of yours. What's his name?
-Hari. -What?
-Hari. -Hari.
Say you'll come with Hari and see her at noon.
-Call her. -Okay.
And listen...
Don't tell Anu that you're with me right now.
-Okay. -Our secret?
Doesn't matter. Call her.
-It's the correct number, right? -Yes, it is.
-It's the right number. -Yeah, okay. She'll pick up.
-Hello. -Super.
Gajar ka Halwa is tasty...
You've already had it!
-Yes! -Not bad.
Ma'am, what time can I come for Chicken Biryani?
Morotow.
Twelve. Tomorrow.
-Twelve. -Sure.
But how will you get here?
You don't know where I live now.
-With Hari. -Okay...
Since you're coming, get me a box of brownies too.
-Brownie? -Yeah, the usual.
I'll get it for you.
-I'll speak to your mother. -Okay.
I'll give her the address too.
-Okay? -Yes, okay.
-Okay, bye. -Okay. Bye. Bye, ma'am. Bye.
-Have you hung up? -Yes. Hung up. Hung up.
What did she say?
It's okay.
-Tomorrow at 12? -Yes.
-With Hari. I'll pick you up. -Okay.
11.30, you and Hari. Wait for me.
Below where you stay. Okay?
Very good.
Okay, you can leave now.
How's it going?
-Is that his car? -Not sure.
Yes, that's the car.
-I'll sit in the front. -No. You sit at the back.
I'll sit in the front.
I'm carrying the brownie. Let me sit in the front.
Hey. What's your problem? Shut up and sit at the back.
-Come on. -Yes, sir.
Idiots!
Wow! I love it.
-Ahaan, what are you doing! -Come on in.
Put the windows up. Please.
What are you doing? The AC is on. Can't you see?
-Okay, sir. -Understood?
-Yes. -Or should I explain it to you again?
Why are you leaning to the front? Sit back. Back.
Look at this stupid woman crossing the road.
-Music... -No.
Don't touch it.
I like listening to English songs.
We're very English too!
Yes, yes.
-Is it? -Yes.
Sing me an English song.
English song.
What language was that?
-It's English. -Yes, it's English.
-Hi. -Hi.
-How are you, Hari? -Very well.
Hey, don't worry. You don't have to take them off here.
Wow, great.
Here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hope you didn't have trouble finding the house?
Not really. We found it.
-Where are my brownies? -Yes.
You're not getting any biryani otherwise!
Brownies for you.
Thank you. How hungry are you guys?
-Because the biryani is ready. -No...
-Pack it. I'll have it later. -Yes.
-Are you sure? -Yes, we'll have it later.
Yes, yes.
Okay, two minutes.
Biryani chicken!
Give it to me...
-I'm serving, wait... -Give me more!
-Enough? -More!
Here.
-Okay. -Yeah!
This is for Mr. Ozzy.
My plate is here.
Oh, okay. I thought...
Give me a piece of chicken.
-That's what I was doing... -Saving it for yourself!
No. It's for you. Please eat.
It's good, isn't it?
Shit!
Oh, God! Not again!
Ahaan!
Hey, clean it!
-Come on, clean it. -Come on, clean it.
Hurry up.
Ahaan!
Yes, Mom.
Hari!
This is for Aarti, this for Mrs. Iyer
and this big one for Mrs. Remedios.
Which one goes to whom? I'm confused!
Don't waste my time.
No. I really didn't understand.
-You're learning English, right? -Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah... -It's all written here.
-Okay? -Okay.
-Now go! Go! -Go.
Come on, Mister.
You deliver the stuff. Ahaan and I will be back soon.
Yeah, okay.
All right, run along! Scram! Come on!.
Acting smart, are we? Fine.
-Listen. -Yes, boss.
-Hey, you don't need to... -Keep it.
You always have such crisp notes.
What's the secret?
I have a currency printing machine at home.
-Really? -Yes.
-Yes? -Would you like to see it?
-Yes. -Will you come now?
I'll quickly finish the deliveries, then we can go.
-Idiot. Run along! -Okay, not to worry.
Money rules
Crisp notes?
Rich man!
I have to keep your idiot servant happy.
Where do you work?
I trade in shares.
Shers. You mean, lions?
Yes, I sell lions.
Where's your office?
I love your car. Super! Rocking car.
Thank you.
How much... Car?
-Why? -I want my own car.
I want to keep a driver for me and go to the office.
Ms. Anu. When will she come?
I don't know.
Did you ask her?
Come on, ask her.
Idiot. Hey!
Move it!
Where are you going? Where are you going?
Ahaan!
What the hell is he doing?
Yes. Perfect.
Problem solved!
-Didn't Hari come? -He's downstairs.
-Smoke. -Oh!
Well, how was the biryani?
Biryani was good. Super!
One minute.
Oh. Chicken lollipop! Nice.
Awesome.
Here.
Ma'am, you're a sweetie!
Oh, come on!
You're late today. I had a lot of work.
All this...
...needs to be washed.
-Ma'am, did sir come here? -No, why?
I saw him downstairs in his car.
Let this be. Go down and see who he's with.
Go now!
What fun!
-Fun, wasn't it? -Yes, chicken lollipop.
-Hi Vani-li-li-la! -Hi.
Oh, who's she?
My...
-friend. -What's her name?
Vanilla.
Vanilla?
Have you ever had a girlfriend?
In school.
Priya.
What happened?
The teacher made her tie me a Rakhi.
She said we're like Brother-Sister.
-She became my sister. -Oh no.
So this girl Vanilla...
-You like her? -Yes.
Very sweet and nice girl. Sweet.
Do you want her to be your girlfriend?
Let me give you some advice. Next time when you meet her...
compliment her.
Girls love compliments.
Like...
You have a beautiful smile,
beautiful eyes, beautiful hair.
-Sexy. -No.
Here. Pack this first. Ahaan.
Mummy. I've turned it off.
-Are you sure? -Yes, of course.
These are your deliveries. Mrs. Lalwani and...
-You read this. -Mrs?
Mrs... Kamath.
-Very good. -The one downstairs.
Okay. And the one Ahaan is packing, give it to Onella.
-Okay. -Vani-la-la-la! I'll go.
Hi, Vani-la-la... Hi, Vani-la-la-la!
Hi, Vani-la-la!
Yes, Mom.
-Hi, Vani-la-la! -Come in.
Mom someone's at the door. I'll call you back later, okay.
Cake for you!
-Thank you. -You're welcome!
Nice perfume. Lovely smell.
Nice bracelet. Where did you get it from?
I got it from Goa.
-Do you like it? -Yes.
Your eyes... You have nice, lovely eyes.
You're very sweet.
-You have WhatsApp? -Yeah, I do.
Give me your number!
Okay...
Save your contact number.
Yup!
Here.
Thank you. I make nice omelets.
I love cheese omelets.
You call me...
-I'll make it for you. -Yeah? You'll make it for me!
-How do you make it? -Take a bowl.
Put it
-inside. -Okay.
Mix it up... like this.
Then turn it on the other side. Omelet for you.
Yum, I can't wait for it.
Sunday, we'll go picnic.
-Picnic? -Ms. Anu, you and me.
-Three of us? -Yeah.
-Don't you want the money? -Yes, of course. I forgot.
-Thanks, Ahaan. -Bye.
Bye!
-Ahaan. -Yes.
-Hi. -Hi.
Come, come.
Come. We'll have lunch together today, okay?
But you know, Hari... Hari. Hari.
-Yes. -He's downstairs.
-Smoking, right? -Yes, chimney.
I want it packed.
No...
We'll eat together today.
-No. -What?
Don't you want to go to the picnic?
Yes, I do.
Where is it?
Ms. Anu... She didn't pack.
Why?
She said...
"If you want to go picnic, eat it here."
Super. Really tasty food. Really tasty food.
Super.
Who's going for a picnic?
Ms. Anu, Vani-la-la and me.
-Are you coming? -Yes, I'm coming!
Come...
Two. Two flowers. Here.
What did you buy flowers for?
Poor girl... She needs money.
Oh, I see.
Give it to your wife.
I suggest you go and give it to Anu.
No... You give it to her.
No... I suggest you go and give it to Anu.
So, my wife has become your best friend now!
-You want to go on a picnic with her? -Yes.
Ms. Anu cooks Biryani for me. Not for you.
Do you know why she does all that for you?
Because she thinks you are a child.
Just a small child.
In fact, a fully grown-up adult
with the brain of a child.
So grow up.
Stop acting like a child.
Now he plays deaf.
What are you doing? Ahaan, what are you doing?
Ahaan!
Ahaan, what are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Ahaan?
-Rock, rock! -Oh, yeah! Rock-rock!
This is Abhishek, that's Imran and Tahir.
-What's your name? -Ahaan!
What the hell are you doing?
Come on. Let's go back to the car. You can't just jump out of the car!
-Don't touch me. -Hurry up. Come on, get in the car.
-Don't touch me. -Come on, get in the car.
Put your seat belt on.
-Hi, Anu. -Yes, tell me.
-How are you? -I'm okay.
What's the matter? Why have you called?
No...
How's your father doing?
I was thinking of meeting him tomorrow.
There's no need for that.
Anu, please. I am sorry.
Please come back.
I'm really missing you.
I think you're missing my food more than me.
Using poor Ahaan for your selfish needs.
It's not like that. It really isn't. Look, we can talk about this.
I have nothing to say to you.
-Just... Just go away. -Please.
I'm sorry.
I really miss you.
I don't think you get it.
It's really over between us.
Hello...
Hello?
Anu...
Your wife has left you.
Why, what happened? Why did she leave?
See...
Honestly, things haven't been very good between us.
Since a long time.
I mean she's been talking about having a child.
And that terrifies me.
In fact, I've been resisting all attempts
at this whole process and journey of having a child.
I mean...
Imagine bringing a child up in this world.
Dust, heat, pollution.
-Are you unable to have sex? -What?
I mean, are you...
not comfortable with sex?
-What? -You know.
You feel contaminated?
No...
I think all that is fine. I think it is good.
I mean...
We haven't been intimate since a long time because of all these issues.
But I think our physical compatibility is good.
I mean...
I've just lost the spark and joy in my life, honestly.
Then you would have to follow my instructions very carefully.
Yeah, sure, I mean... If your words will help me get back my wife.
No.
I cannot guarantee that. I am not a marriage counselor.
But I can help you.
You said you almost had an accident.
What was that?
Leave!
Get lost!
Don't touch the car! Go!
-I need money for food. -I don't have any money.
-Money for food, please. -Go!
Go away!
Go.
-Wha... -Give me that.
I also have a spare one. I carry a spare.
In case the nozzle doesn't work. It sometimes gets stuck.
Self-control.
That's the first step.
Okay.
Fix an appointment with me...
next week.
Mr. Ozzy, I want you to take one of these.
What's this for?
Something to soothe your nerves.
-One? -Yes.
Good.
I want you to be relaxed, Mr. Ozzy.
Okay?
Please drive me home!
You just left your house. What's the hurry?
It's urgent! I can't wait.
Just a little patience, Mr. Ozzy.
I'm taking you to the perfect place.
What have I got myself into?
Go there.
Where's the bathroom? There?
-Is there a queue? -Can't you see?
-How much time will it take? -It will take time, buddy.
Please let me go!
You ask me to trust you, and this is what you do to me!
You... You gave me a laxative!
This is Exposure Therapy.
Without a laxative, you would have never gone to a public toilet.
Never.
Mr. Ozzy, so far you have been
avoiding feared objects, situations, activities.
This exposure therapy helps you to break that pattern...
of avoidance and fear.
-Do you understand? -Yeah, yeah...
Just think, who you are doing this for...
and you will be fine.
Come on, the train won't wait for you! It's too crowded!
It's moving.
I can't put my life at risk for this. It's moved!
Come.
Ahaan.
I'm really sorry for the last time.
It's okay. Forget it.
You're very sly.
Sly? Me?
-Why? -Ice cream?
Trying to butter me up?
Little bit.
You are...
...a lucky man.
Me and lucky man?
Why do you say that?
You can go anywhere.
I have to ask.
That is because your parents are worried about you.
Mom says, "No picnic".
Is it? Why?
Hari's gone to his village.
You come along with me.
You take care of me.
Like Hari.
-Understood? -Yes of course. Anything else?
Yes, I want a lottery ticket. I want a code number. 506.
Why do you want a lottery ticket?
I want to win. I want money.
I want my flat. My wedding.
I want my wife.
I want two children.
One boy, one girl.
Hi, dude.
Oh, hi! Where are the others?
Coming...
-Hi, Anu. -Hi.
What are you doing here?
Tell her.
Hari's gone to his village. So, he will take care of me.
Like a caretaker.
I think you guys should carry on.
I'm not feeling up to it.
Hey, come on. I want to go picnic with all of you. I'm really not up to it.
You guys go, have fun.
He's planned it for a long time. You'll break his heart, Anu.
Shall we?
Come on.
-Are you excited? -Yes.
Okay! So we'll jump into the water.
-I'll jump onto you. -Oh!
Hey, Vada Pav!
Wow, I love Vada Pav!
I want to have it.
-Are you allowed to have this? -Yes, I eat everything.
-Are you sure? -Yes.
Okay.
Here.
Money.
Get three. Only three.
Come, I'll come with you.
Come.
He'll get it. Let's go.
Come.
One, two, three, four.
-Four Vada Pavs. -Okay.
I think Ozzy doesn't know how to count.
Yeah, really!
How are you?
I'm fine.
You left just like that...
Over such a small matter...
Just packed your bags.
I just want to tell you that...
I really miss you.
I really do.
You don't even reply to my messages...
Oh, he's come.
Vada-Pav, Vada-Pav!
Vada-Pav!
-Here you go. -Thank you.
Here's yours.
-Have your Vada-Pav... -No, no... I'm good.
This is good. Good for health. Makes you strong.
You'll grow muscles.
-No, I'm fine without this. -Come on, just have it.
Come on, it's just a Vada-Pav.
All right, if you insist.
It's dripping off.
You guys know how Pav got its name, right?
No?
Well, the dough is kneaded by men
using their pao...
Which is the foot, so...
Vada-Pav.
-Nice breeze. -Nice breeze.
I know.
It's nice now. It's not too sunny.
Yeah...
-What? -Come, let's take a walk.
Wait!
-Let me keep my bag. -Hey, don't go too far.
-I'll hold it. -Yeah, thanks.
Don't go too far.
Let's go.
Whoa! Wait...
Where are you taking me?
Kabaddi...
What?
-Come here. -Look there.
You know, Anu...
After spending time with Ahaan, I've realized,
we complicate things a lot.
Okay...
Why this sudden profound realization?
No, I mean, look at him...
He's so simple, uncomplicated... No pretenses.
And he's all heart.
I'll show it to you. Hold...
His endearing nature...
How he befriends absolute strangers... It's remarkable, right?
Wow!
He's had quite an impact on you!
What made you step out today?
Has it occurred to you that I could be getting better?
Has it occurred to you?
I'm just surprised, you know...
You're not feeling dizzy, uneasy... You're okay?
Well for that, I have been advised to gaze at something...
which will have a calming effect on me.
You see.
Anu.
Look.
I know I've been difficult to live with
and I take full responsibility.
But I've been working hard on it.
Or shall I say...
Mr. Sippy has been.
Quite a deadly guy he is.
-You finally went and saw him! -Yes, I did.
Tough taskmaster he is.
Worst experience of my life.
You deserve it. You needed this!
-Bye. -Bye.
-Bye. -Bye.
Okay, let's go!
Ahaan.
Come, sit in the front. Come on.
Let's go, please. Come on!
Am I your chauffeur? Come ahead!
-Come on, quick. -Go on, go ahead.
Quick.
That's better.
Thank you, your excellency. Let's go!
Hello.
Yeah, speaking. May I know who this is?
Actually, it's my weekly off today.
But you can send in your resume and I'll get back to you?
Yeah.
Work call on a Sunday!
Yeah, welcome to my life.
When you're in H.R, your phone just doesn't stop ringing.
What does this H.R stand for?
H.R. stands for Human Resource.
Basically, when someone wants a job, they call me.
Okay, I will call you. I want a job.
Do you want a job?
Just take my job. Please take it.
There we are.
-That's your building. -We had a lot of fun!
I mean I had a lot of fun.
-Yes. -Yes.
-And we'll do it again... -See you guys.
-Yes, we must do it again. -We will...
-Bye! -Bye!
I will also work.
I want to work, like everyone.
But you are working.
I mean just imagine... Without you,
how would we enjoy your mother's brownies and cookies?
Right?
That's my mother's work.
I want my own work.
My own car.
Lovely car.
Big house.
My... My own life.
I want... I want a job.
Please help me. I'm a good friend.
Mom...
-Yeah. -Come here.
Come here. Look...
-Oh, yeah! That's nice. Very good. -Yeah, that's nice.
Let me see...
-Yes. It looks nice on you. -Yeah!
-It seems that you know what you want. -I know what I want.
Yeah?
Okay. So, out of this, choose whatever you like.
-Okay. -And I'm going to the ladies' section.
-Okay. -Okay?
Go have fun.
-Excuse me. -Yeah.
Do you work here?
-Yeah, I do. -How can I get a job?
I'm so sorry... I need to attend to other customers as well.
-Please excuse me. -Who's your boss?
Look, I can't deal with your questions.
Wow, nice car. Super car.
Super!
Who are you with?
I'm on my own.
Are you looking for a salesman?
I'm good. This is a lovely car.
Smooth. Fast like a rocket.
Take your wife. Long drive.
Please wait... Please.
-Ahaan, where are you? -Yes, Mom.
-I've been looking everywhere for you! -Don't scream, Mom.
-Where are you right now? -I'm down.
-Okay. -Wait right there, I'm coming.
-Wait right there, I'm coming. -Come down. I'll wait.
I want a job.
I'll work hard.
Do you know how to drive?
No, I will learn.
Okay. Learn and come.
Now, just like a rocket...
Ahaan.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
What are you doing in front of the car showroom?
I went to see... I went to see the car!
Let's go.
Don't ever do this again.
I will learn... the car.
Do you mean drive? Drive the car.
What happened? Why are you saying that?
Car showroom. Sir will give me a job
if I know how to drive a car.
I want to be busy.
Like my father.
Nice clothes.
Come. Orange juice?
No juice.
Job!
Yeah, but let's talk about it over juice. Come.
My mom... My mom is waiting for me.
I'll go.
Please help me. Help me get a job.
No juice. Only job.
So Ahaan was like, he wants to work. He wants a job.
And I also thought it's a passing fancy, you know...
The sort of things he gets stuck on to.
It will evaporate with time...
But he kept reminding me every day.
I want to work, I want a job.
But that's fantastic.
-It's good! -Yeah.
But you know, we're not too sure as to how to go about it.
Whether his parents will agree.
But that's always the case, you know,
in these kinds of situations.
I'll give you my personal experience.
The day Pranay was born, my husband left us.
And...
He hasn't bothered coming back.
So...
I had to raise Pranay single-handedly.
About six-seven years ago, I had a health issue.
And I was bedridden for six months.
So I had to give up my job and...
Things were quite tough for us financially, you know.
So, Pranay and I
consciously decided to look for opportunities for him.
And you can imagine.
People didn't make it easy.
You know how they are.
Comments and judgments and...
I don't know.
But thank God we were really focused and very determined.
Of course, we didn't have a choice either.
But we worked on it. It was hard.
But finally, he got a job.
-Oh nice. -Today, I'm really proud to say
that in my hardest, most difficult days...
It was my Pranay who was the breadwinner.
He actually kept us afloat.
That's really moving.
You know what? I want to show you something.
Pranay got the national award from the President of India.
He got it for the intellectual disability category.
He was the best employee.
Wow.
This must be inspiring for so many!
I used to always wonder, after me...
what will happen to Pranay.
Will there be anybody to actually take care of him.
Now when I look at him, he doesn't need anybody.
He's just so self-reliant...
It's just ironic that
society is so judgmental,
parents get even more protective.
But in the end the child suffers, right?
And that's not fair.
He keeps us together He binds us all
Fills life with pointless humor
He loves so easy His beautiful mind
Pure, selfless, full of life
Everyday's a party Everyday's a ball
He's one in a million He's one of a kind
Simpleton, so sweet Adorable so meek
Simpleton, so sweet Adorable so meek
Who's the one we love to meet?
It's Ahaan, Ahaan!
It's Ahaan, Ahaan!
No, but really, hats off to you both.
You know, just look at Ahaan.
You can clearly see, he's got...
such a good upbringing.
That credit goes entirely to Gayatri.
No, no. It's not like that at all.
It's... We're parents, so...
Actually, I wanted to speak to you about a recent development.
You know since Ahaan has become friendly with us.
He comes over. We have a lot of conversations.
So, he keeps talking about getting a job.
Seeking some sort of employment.
No, no, look. Don't pay much attention to him.
We'll deal with him.
In fact, we met someone.
Her son... Even he's got Down Syndrome.
But now he's independent.
Look we really appreciate your concern.
But we are not open to this.
We're doing what's best for Ahaan and getting him a job is out of the question.
You know, we've tried. We've given it a good shot.
Anything more, it'll be too interfering, I think...
-Let's go. -What is going on?
What's Ozzy trying to do with him?
No more going out
and making deliveries.
And also, please call Anu.
And tell her wacko husband to mind his own business.
But I never... Ranjit!
I'm hearing this for the first time. Believe me.
I have no idea what they were talking about.
See for yourself. I promise you. Come.
See I told you.
And as proved, see...
There's dust here...
Dust! See.
They're some grains there. There's a lot of dirt there.
I've changed! I told you.
What? Don't you believe me?
-I promise you. -Of course...
You know I've been thinking...
Hey...
Your lines have changed, see?
The lines on your palm look different.
Noticed?
Look at this.
These two lines...
They're additional lines.
Do you know what they signify?
No?
Family. Children.
I was thinking that we should start a family.
The house feels very empty.
What do you say?
What?
No?
What?
Come on!
Don't be difficult.
Come on in.
I don't like machine work.
I want job.
Office job, like dad.
I'm tired.
I'll finish my life.
I want a new life.
I'm calling from Marine Drive police station.
-All set for the interview? -I'm nervous.
What are you nervous about?
They'll ask you easy stuff. Very simple questions.
It's my first time.
What if it is the first time? Relax, don't worry.
-Let's practice. -Okay, cool.
Introduce yourself.
My name is Ahaan.
I forgot.
No. See you're forgetting because you're not confident. Look at me.
Confident. Take a deep breath.
Chest out. Stomach in.
Hi, my name is Ahaan.
And I'm 25 years old.
What happened? Why are you laughing?
-You're a funny man! -You're a funny man too.
Come on, do it. Practice!
Confident. Attitude!
Take a deep breath, chest out.
-My name is Ahaan. -Yes.
-I'm old, 25. -Yes.
I need money... for the job.
Do you need money for the job?
You got to crack this interview, my friend!
-Yes. -Yes, confident?
Confident!
They'll ask you about yourself. Your personality.
Your dreams, your desires,
-your ambitions... -Ambitions.
What if they ask you, "what you want to be in 10 years?"
I have left for you behind
For you don't belong to me
Your heart belongs
To someone else
Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true?
And why should I call your name
When you're to blame For making me blue?
Welcome to Singapore, ladies and gentlemen,
and to all Singaporeans and residents of Singapore,
a warm welcome home.
Hello?
You record this, okay? Later you put at where?
Arts Central? At what time?
Next year?
Whatever.
Now, starting the "Skaters' Waltz".
What are you doing?
Your attention, please. For your own safety, please stand behind the yellow line.
How did you know Mum?
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Mom
Happy birthday to you
Now, you have to blow it.
Mom, you have to make a wish. Make a wish before you blow out the last two. Make a wish to yourself.
I wish I'll be free from aches and pains.
Wait. Now, blow out those two.
I have always felt myself a Singaporean, even though I live in New York.
I am both a New Yorker and Singaporean in equal parts.
I first performed "4'33"" in Singapore at the Arts Festival.
I think this was back in 1991.
There was a gentleman who was so indignant and insulted by this experience
There was a gentleman who was so indignant and insulted by this experience of having to sit in the concert hall with nothing happening, that he left the auditorium and slammed the door behind him,
that he left the auditorium and slammed the door behind him,
which was absolutely perfect.
And then, a decade later, I performed "4'33"" again in Singapore,
and I was so welcomed back this time.
Whereas the first time the critic, you know, really lambasted me.
So, it was a real homecoming.
They were literally lining up to have CDs purchased and autographed. And we did this for close to an hour, and we sold about 50 CDs,
And we did this for close to an hour, and we sold about 50 CDs,
and I signed them all personally.
I recently had the great privilege of performing a 75th birthday tribute
to George Crumb at Carnegie Hall this past November.
I felt very, very privileged that the New York Times' Weekend Arts section gave me the cover slot…
Weekend Arts section gave me the cover slot…
…as a teaser for the article inside, which…
I got a rave review in the New York Times.
How does it feel now, to be welcomed?
It warms the cockles of my ageing heart.

Everybody say, "Hello, Charlee."
Hello, Charlee!
-Can you hear that? -Cannot.
You know, Charlee, you've been around for 50 years,
performing first with my dad, and then, with me.
-Correct. Long time. -I know.
Tell me, through the years, how have the kids changed over 50 years?
-You know something? -What?
-Fifty years, lots of things have changed. -Correct.
But, you know, children, over 50 years, they have not changed.
-You can speak 36 languages? -Yeah.
-Can I test you now? -Why?
-Show everybody how clever you are. -All right.
How to you say "thank you" in Chinese?
How to say "How are you" in Chinese?
-I teach you some nice Malay words. -Okay.
-You follow me. -Okay.
Tonight.

I meet many friends.
I meet many animals.
I can tell the same jokes for 50 years, and different kids still laugh at the same jokes.

You must hold the ball like this
You are not supposed to hold the ball like that, okay?
You can only hold the ball like this.
If you hold the ball like this, I will have to stop you, okay?
All right? So, please hold the ball properly, okay?
Don't fumble.
You concentrate on your ball, okay? Straight.
-Who's gonna win? -Red! -Who's gonna win? -Red!

So let us rejoice
While we are young

While we are young
After the pleasant youth
After the annoying old age
We shall live in the soil

We just liked the song, that's all.
In those days, when we sang, we just enjoyed the song.
It reminds us of the days when--
Actually, for myself, we didn't quite know the meaning.
The implications and meaning.
But we just like the rhythm.
Had only our music teacher still been alive,
he would join us now.
I could invite him to come here.
I left school 50 years ago. Fifty years ago.
Today is my 50th anniversary.
1954.
The time frame of four minutes and 33 seconds,
is purely an artificial parameter.
So, in that period of time, we can concentrate
and listen to the music of the environment,
which is constantly ongoing. It never ceases and it's continually varied.
We never listen to the environment.
We are too busy listening to the thoughts in our head.
Doors closing.
Next stop, Tanjong Pagar.
Outram Park interchange.
Potong Pasir is "Potong Pasir." Right?
Bedok I would say "Bedok."
I don't think anybody else would say it differently.
Clementi is "Clementi."
Yeah. How would you say it in Singlish?
-Clementi. -Clementi.
Really?
Lavender, I don't go with the Singlish way of saying "Lavender."
It's "Lavender."
I did attend Raffles Girls' School,
and we had a principal at that time there, and she was a stickler for us speaking perfect English.
There's no way that you could go wrong with that kind of training.
The station Queenstown seems a bit muffled.
And I keep telling myself, "That's something I got to re-do."
I mean, I want to be recognized by the industry,
but not by the passengers, the everyday passenger. No. There's no need to.
It's good for them to know there's a voice that comes on air and tells them, gives them instructions and all that.
Your attention, please. Eating or drinking is not allowed in the stations and trains.
Thank you for keeping the stations and trains clean
for the comfort of all passengers.
Wait here, I'll call you. When bus comes, I'll call you.
This is not my bus. My bus is behind.

At that time, it was a toy, not an instrument.
Now, I am not a recorder player at all.
I've never really liked the instrument myself.
But it became, I think, the instrument of choice because
the people in the extracurricular, now called co-curricular department of the Ministry of Education, felt
now called co-curricular department of the Ministry of Education, felt
now called co-curricular department of the Ministry of Education, felt that every child has two hands,
and therefore, they can use their fingers and blow.
And by movement of fingers they could get these notes.
Even I would have difficulty hitting the right notes
because the air pressure has to be equal to the sound.
Low notes, you blow slower, you know,
and something like that.
And to ask children to play with this, they always will hit, for the low C…
Mind you, the low C, the hardest note.
The moment you do a bit too much, you get…
You get the high octave.
And worse still, if you blow too much…
The harmonica, like the piano, has a fixed pitch. I do know children, and if you spoke to them, they will tell you this,
and if you spoke to them, they will tell you this, exactly what I am saying.
That they didn't really enjoy playing this instrument,
but they had to, It was part of their music class,
and they did their best with it. I have promoted
Our leaders were probably people who had their music education either in Europe or in England.
You see? There were some who went to France, there were some who went to UK.
And if you had gone to either France or UK, this was probably used in schools.
And so, they copied the idea from the British.
I would think so, you see?
Whereas we should have taken the idea from China.
Long, long, long ago, harmonicas were imported in Singapore.
And they could have been considered for use.
Unfortunately…
I chose "Chooks" because it's my 21st century tribute
I chose "Chooks" because it's my 21st century tribute to the noodle seller of my childhood.
And you see why, right?
Remember when the boy used to come ahead?
The little assistant would come ahead of the noodle seller and he's have his…
There was also the scrap dealer,
and there was also this wonderful scissor grinder who would come around.
And I still remember his cry which was something like…
And he would sing it in a very rhythmic way. And all this is something that I think children today,
And all this is something that I think children today, have absolutely no experience of.
I want to tell the world

If you are happy And you know it, say "Charlee"
Charlee!
Charlee, you have been performing with me for 23 years, traveling all over the world.
I have actually lost count of the number of shows we've performed together.
I have not.
-You have not? -Not.
How many shows have we performed together?
Thirty-two thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight.
No. Just kidding.
All right. After 50 years performing,
what would you like to say to all Singaporeans? All right.
I've been around for 50 years.
Even older than Singapore.
All of you know me.
In fact, I am to Singaporeans, what Mickey Mouse is to Americans.
So, why is it that after 50 years of being a true Singaporean,
I have never received my National Day Service award? Why?
Let's give Charlee a big hand! Charlee!

Wasted days and wasted nights
I have left for you behind
For you don't belong to me
Your heart belongs To someone else
Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true?
And why should I call your name
When you're to blame For making me blue?
Don't you remember the day
When you went away
And left me?
I was so lonely
Cried for you only
My love
Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true?
And why should I call your name
When you're to blame For making me blue?
How's that?
And those that will never forget.
The 26th of December, 2004
may be a distant memory for most of us.
But for thousands of others,
that date is etched in their minds forever.
Every year they recall the extraordinary impact
the Boxing Day tsunami had on their lives
and the lives of so many others.
I couldn’t escape.
The wave hit the left side of my car.
As I walked, I heard a sound like an explosion. Boom! Boom!
It's terrible, and it's like a war zone.
The water sucked me in just like a toilet flush
inside the bungalow.
All I can remember is that people were running
and that the wave was as high as a coconut tree.
This year is the tenth anniversary of the devastating tragedy
which took the lives of almost 230,000 people
from more than a dozen countries.
Five people from four places that were hit by the tsunami
in three countries
share their memories of what it was like for them on that fateful day,
when their lives were changed forever
in just two hours on one fateful day.
Aceh is the most northern province on the island of Sumatra.
The western coastal areas were among the hardest hit by the tsunami.
Before the disaster, Lampu’uk beach was a favorite destination for tourists.
But it was hit hard by the waves and afterwards it lay in ruins.
There was only one building near the beach that was not destroyed.
Rahmatullah Mosque.
In the corner of the mosque,
there are some pillars which were damaged by the tsunami,
but the mosque committee decided not to repair them
in order that future generations will remember the disaster.
At 7:58 a.m. on Sunday the 26th of December, 2004,
a massive earthquake measuring nine on the Richter scale
struck the west coast of Northern Sumatra.
The energy released on the Earth's surface was equivalent to the explosion
of 23,000 Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs.
In Banda Aceh, the people that lived there rushed from their homes
straight after the first ripples of the earthquake.
Local cameraman Rizki Aulia will never forget.
I never ever expected a tsunami could happen in Aceh.
I never expected it.
At the time, I was standing near a coconut tree.
The force of the tremors made the coconuts fall from the tree.
Then I saw several houses
being instantly destroyed by the earthquake.
That was the beginning.
In 2004, Rizki lived in Banda Aceh
with his wife, Elly, and a young daughter, Syifa Nabila.
Apart from being a mother and housewife,
Elly also ran a small shop underneath their house,
and worked part time as a makeup artist.
Before the tsunami came,
I spoke with my mother-in-law.
I told her I had a bad feeling,
so she suggested I take a shower.
Then my mother-in-law screamed,
"Elly! Get out of the shower! It’s an earthquake."
I couldn’t stand upright anymore and I started throwing up.
I was thinking what has happened to my wife and child.
The tremors were so strong that there was no way you could run or walk.
You couldn’t even stand up.
When the tremors stopped, I rushed home to check on my wife and child.
And thank God, they were safe.
Below the Indian Ocean, a massive piece of the Earth's crust suddenly shifted…
and raised the sea floor dramatically.
and raised the sea floor dramatically. The violent movement displaced billions of tons of water above it
The violent movement displaced billions of tons of water above it
and sent powerful shockwaves in every direction.
The devastating tsunami waves
then traveled rapidly across the ocean towards land,
reaching speeds of over 800 kilometers per hour.
As the tsunami got closer to land,
it grew into monster ten-meter high waves.
The force was irresistible.
Suddenly, about 15 minutes after the tremors,
a young man on a motorbike
went past my house and shouted,
"Run, run, the seawater is as high as the coconut tree."
I then realized that Banda Aceh must have collapsed
and was now being submerged under water.
So, I grabbed my daughter and my mother-in-law,
who urged me to get into the backseat of the car with them.
But there was nowhere to sit, as it was already full.
Then someone said, "Don’t just stand there, run!"
I ran towards the end of our street but the wave was closing in fast.
I screamed "Don’t get into the car".
But the warning came too late,
and while Elly was swept away by the wave,
her daughter, her mother, and Rizki's parents were all trapped in the car.
The car that had been in front of my house got swept away
and got stuck on the balcony.
There were three layers of cars.
There was one car, then another, and my car was on top.
I tried to help the family who were inside the car
but they were all stuck and I couldn’t save them.
I was confused.
I thought "Dear, Allah, what’s happened to my family?
Will I be alone in this world?
Will they survive? Is it the end of the world?"
Then I crashed into the roof of the house, so I screamed for help.
I didn’t have any choice but to run back inside the house
and get up here to the second floor.
I managed to get here but my wife didn’t.
The tsunami swept her away to the back of our house,
while the car was still stuck down there.
Somehow she managed to reach the roof.
We then heard someone screaming for help,
and God knows where the strength came from,
but we managed to tear the roof off
and were able to save my wife and another girl, too.
Banda Aceh was totally devastated by the tsunami.
The huge wall of water was so powerful
that it picked up ships and left them several miles inland.
Meanwhile, in Phuket,
it was a lovely sunny morning
and the beach was full of people enjoying the good weather,
totally unaware of the impending disaster heading their way.
Phuket is one of Thailand's most popular holiday destinations,
and with its many temples,
visitor attractions,
and sandy beaches,
tourists enjoy coming here all year round.
But Christmas is the peak season,
so there were many people on Patong Beach on Boxing Day morning in 2004.
Local bar manager, Apple, was one of them.
She was having breakfast with eight of her friends
who she'd been working with all night.
We walked down to the beach and sat together near the sea.
We drank and walked around and talked. You know how girls talk.
Noisy, more than birds, more than chicken.
It was Apple's turn to go and get the girls some drinks.
As Apple walked to the mini mart, she heard a strange sound.
As I walked, I heard a sound like an explosion. Boom! Boom!
Patong often has a problem with its electricity outage,
so we are used to hearing explosions.
Sometimes it’s only one boom, but sometimes it happens many times,
and it also causes a lot of smoke after explosion.
Just after I heard the explosion the phone box suddenly fall down.
As it fell, it hit me here.
I felt terrible pain, and then I became unconscious.
Despite a lag of up to several hours
between the earthquake and the impact of the tsunami,
nearly all of the victims in Phuket were taken completely by surprise.
Much of Thailand's coastline was decimated that morning,
but Khao Lak was hit the worst.
Franky Gun remembers it all too well.
In 2004, he was working in real estate
and just got a brand new office on the main road.
His wife, Lak was pregnant,
and everything in his life was looking good for him.
Before I moved to Khao Lak,
I actually did a check on the Internet for the safest places in the world,
according to natural disasters and stuff.
Violence, political unrest and stuff.
The west coast of Thailand actually came out very, very good.
So I thought, okay, I'm fine over there,
so it's a very, very good area to stay, the west coast of Thailand.
On Boxing Day morning, Lak went to Phuket
but Franky stayed in bed, as it was his day off.
I woke up because of the earthquake.
So it was… We had two tremors.
The first one woke me up,
and then shortly after, the second one came.
So I looked through the window and I just saw these people running.
They had bikinis, um, swimsuits on and everybody was running.
And a lot of noise outside, and I thought, what's going on?
Then my mother said to me, "Franky, the water is coming."
I said, what water?
They were a very close family,
and Franky hugged his mother, Ursula,
and his father, Franz, that morning, as he always did, twice a day, every day.
It would be their last embrace.
It is kind of a horror movie, or something like that,
where everything slows down,
you're kind of frozen in that situation
because you have no idea what is going on.
And that was…
perhaps the lifesaver because if we would have made it
outside at that moment, we might as well be…
I might be dead as well.
As a tsunami is a series of waves,
the first wave may not be the most dangerous.
We have been inside the house when the first wave hit
and then the water rose again
up to about one meter 50 high, or something like that.
And then the entrance door glass burst.
All the water was coming inside very quickly,
and the water level was rising and it didn't stop.
I was screaming at my parents, "We have to get out of here,
We have to get out of here now."
And I tried to open the kitchen door,
and I couldn't open it because it was stuck.
All of a sudden I was outside of the house.
The water level was maybe two meters by then.
Then the last thing that I did was shouting in towards the house,
"Mom, Dad, you have to get out of there. The water is rising."
And then the next wave came.
The water pushed me towards the nearby bungalow
and I thought, wow, this is good.
You can grab the roof and climb onto the roof and you're going to be safe.
And in the very instant I touched the roof,
the doors and the windows of this bungalow broke
and the water sucked me in
just like a toilet flush inside the bungalow.
Then I was underwater
with all the furniture and everything that was inside the house, I guess.
And was just bobbing around like a ping pong ball
in this little bungalow.
Trapped underwater.
And it was pitch black.
And it must have been for at least two minutes.
I came to the point where I couldn't hold my breath anymore.
And I thought that I going to die.
In Aceh, Rizki was still stuck on top of his roof
while his daughter, his parents, and his mother-in-law
were trapped in the car.
And then the next wave came.
I tried to rescue anyone who was still alive.
Those of us who still had strength,
tried to save anyone that was near the rooftop of our house.
My wife had been dragged by the tsunami into the house.
She can’t swim, but somehow, she managed to reach the roof.
So, she stayed on the roof and I went back down to the second floor
to try to help the others inside the car.
I dived under the water and found my mother, but she had already died.
I went down deeper and managed to grab a little child’s hand.
I brought him up to the second floor.
His face was covered by mud, so I cleaned it.
He turned out to be my wife’s youngest brother.
I pumped his chest,
trying to give him resuscitation, but got no reaction,
so I left him and went back in the water again.
This time I grabbed a little child and when I took her out,
she was covered with mud.
I cleaned her face and discovered that it was my own daughter.
She was only two years, eight months and six days old.
Apart from their only daughter,
Elly's mother, and both of Rizki's parents also drowned that day.
We were a very loving family. We never got angry at each other.
We loved all the children.
After the third wave receded back to the ocean,
we realized that it must be a tsunami.
We didn’t dare to get off the roof.
We were thirsty and hungry
but at that moment we thought
those who have survived must keep on living.
While we were on the roof, my wife told me that we have nothing left.
We have nothing.
But I said no, we still have God.
In Khao Lak, Franky was still fighting for his life.
I was just thinking at that moment, I don't want to die.
Please, please, I don't want to die.
And then it snapped again, and I was on the surface.
In that bungalow, looking at the roof,
the ceiling was gone.
And I could see light shining through from outside
and I got pushed underwater again.
All of a sudden I was outside,
and had this mattress right in front of me.
So I grabbed the mattress and I was just shaking
like a cat in ice water or something like that.
So I didn't have really, any power to swim.
If the mattress wouldn't have been there, I would have drowned for sure.
A few 100 meters further on my journey, I met the wife of a friend of mine.
And she just popped out. I don't know where she was coming from.
All of a sudden she was there.
And I pulled her to the mattress and let her hold onto the mattress, too.
And she asked me, "Franky, what happened?"
I said, "There was an earthquake in the morning,
so this must be some kind of tidal wave or something."
And then, without talking at all, we just floated on,
and I said, "There's a tree."
So we let go of the mattress, climbed up on a tree.
But then sitting on the tree, I realized there was a dead guy
hanging in the tree right next to me so I could have touched him.
It was nightmarish.
The tsunami's path of destruction
continued traveling across the Indian Ocean
towards Sri Lanka.
Get inside. Come on, guys.
Within hours of the earthquake, the tsunami slammed into Sri Lanka.
On the west coast, a passenger train on its way to Galle
was lifted into the air by the waves,
killing over 1,500 people onboard.
The coastal lifestyle of people living in Sri Lanka
contributed to the high number of dead and the many homes that were destroyed.
Batticaloa is on an island surrounded by a lagoon
on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka.
There was no indication that a disaster was about to occur
on Boxing Day morning in 2004.
The sky was clear,
and the wind was coming from the land,
so it was an ideal day for close-to-shore fishing.
Then suddenly, the tsunami ripped into the coast without warning.
Sakthivell Thangavel remembers the day vividly.
At the time, he was working with USA International Development,
and received a call that his twin sister had been killed
while attending a temple ceremony in Batticaloa.
Mahasakthi is…
Yeah, she's my sister.
And Maha means 'big' and Sakthi is energy in our language.
My sister was a chemistry teacher.
She was teaching in a school,
and even though she's a science teacher, she believed in spiritual activities.
On that day, as it's a full moon day,
she was living in the middle of the Batticaloa district,
like three kilometers away from the sea.
So if she lived there, she would have
really kind of escaped like, people like us.
She came for a spiritual activity, spiritual event,
and after finishing that, she went with her son
to a nearby building which is situated in the same temple,
and her husband went to buy something for the temple.
This is the time when the tsunami came,
according to the people who saw this incident there.
Within that time period, somebody have, from that Kallady area,
have informed that there are some bodies closer to this temple and said
most of them who went to temple were died.
And from that end only, our relatives have started to search for her.
One of my brothers who was directly involved
in the searching activity called me,
called my wife and told that,
we're thinking my sister is lost.
Immediately after that, we try to arrange a van to come here.
As I told you, my wife was pregnant, so we couldn't do that
and we couldn't find any van on that day.
It was sudden kind of an activity
to those areas, like the district which I belongs to.
So I used all my network to get a van in the early morning next day.
We travelled together and when we arrived here,
the first shocking news I got was my sister's body was buried
and her son's body was buried because they couldn't keep it the way…
The body was fresh, but because of the water and other things
they couldn't keep it, so that was the first disappointment.
This is the place where my sister lost her life.
The big wave came from there,
and she saw that and suddenly she climbed into the building with her son
and then the wave washed her.
And when we came as a team to search,
I searched outside and my brothers,
and other searched here and they found my sister here.
Because of her long hair, it was stucked with the tree.
And that is why we were lucky enough to get her
and her son's bodies here without any damage.
While the tsunami continued on its western course,
in Phuket, the waves had finally stopped coming
and ambulances were now taking survivors to hospital.
Apple was among them.
When she was found, she was still unconscious,
had a palm frond piercing her stomach, and had lost all her hair.
When I woke up, I didn’t know where I was.
I didn’t have any hair, and I couldn’t feel my legs.
I have to remember, "Where are my mom and my brother?
I want to see my mother, my brother and sister."
I cried but nobody cared. Everyone have problem the same.
I wanted to find my mother and brother.
Then I wanted to know if any of my friends had survived.
But unfortunately, all her friends on the beach that morning had died.
During my recovery, I just lay down on the bed and slept all the time.
Woke up each time, I found no one, none of my family or friends,
so I just slept.
Apple lost her memory,
and couldn't give her name to the hospital staff.
As her family hadn't heard from her, they thought she was dead.
Apple stayed in hospital for the next few months
until eventually her memory came back.
On March 28th,
I phoned home.
My brother answered the phone.
"Apple, where are you?"
I told my mother I was in the hospital.
"Where? Phuket."
My mother came to the hospital to see me. She cried and my brother also cried.
They couldn’t recognize me because I didn’t have any hair
and my skin was so pale that I looked like a ghost.
The next morning, we went home.
In Khao Lak, rescue workers
started the almost impossible task of finding all the missing persons
and letting their families know if their loved ones were alive or dead.
I got the distinct feeling
that my parents were not alive anymore at that moment.
After the near-death experience in the bungalow,
I kind of knew.
I don't know why, but I just had,
I was 100% sure that they were not alive anymore.
I was searching for my parents of course, afterwards.
But honestly, I wished that I wouldn't find them
because I didn't know if I could deal with it,
to see my parents dead, in a puddle of water.
We went to talk to the DVI team
in Takua Pa a couple of times.
And I talked to a guy, his name was Frank as well.
And he was very, very helpful.
He told me what I can bring to make it easier to identify my parents.
So he told me about getting in contact,
getting in touch with the dentist of my parents,
tried to find photos of distinct marks.
I was in Germany at the time,
to clear out the flat of my parents,
which was to me, even, not worse than the tsunami,
but it was close.
Because dealing with all these memories,
and I've been living there from age six until age 19.
When we were finished with this,
two days after,
we got a phone call at my uncle's house, where I was staying at the time.
And there was a guy from the BKA,
Bundeskriminalamt, German Police.
And he told him that my dad has been identified.
And he asked them, what about my mom and they said,
no match so far.
I hoped for my mom to be identified as well,
and that happened the very next day.
So, I made plans then for my return.
We took the ashes of my parents back home,
into the flat where we were living at that time in Phuket,
and had them there for seven days,
which is kind of thing that you have to do before you do burial at sea.
So we had a bouquet of flowers, wedding picture of my parents,
and a couple of flowers,
and things to put in the sea.
And we did a little ceremony
with all the things that my parents loved
to eat and drink here in Thailand.
It was very sad, but it was also, a kind of relief because
we got closure at that point.
So we knew that, okay, now we've done everything,
you know, as perfect as we could, given the circumstances.
In Sri Lanka, Sakthivell was devastated
by the loss of his twin sister who had been extremely close to.
The waves came from this sea, it’s up to that scale,
beyond the tree level,
and the wave went into this side.
And when we came here to search for my sister and others,
the area was full of bodies,
and that area were covered with babies and other bodies,
as well as many vehicles were also washed there.
It's really hard for us to identify which body belongs to whom,
and especially when I was searching for my family,
it's difficult for me to identify
because lots of bodies, and looks like the same.
When I came here, I saw bodies in all these trees.
I was searching for my sister and others, turning the bodies the other side
and looking at the damaged faces.
And I walked around and I saw
children's bodies as well as women and everyone.
And one woman, I still can remember,
had her body like this, trying her best not to allow the water go in
but still she was died and she was like…
It shaked me.
It's terrible, and it's like a war zone.
As the news spread across the world,
the magnitude of the disaster became clear.
And soon assistance, support and sympathy
came for the people affected by the disaster.
The international response was unprecedented,
with over $20 million in aid being pledged.
The final death toll of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami was 226,000.
Ten years after the tsunami,
new roads and houses have been built in Aceh
and there has been an end to the long-running conflict
between Acehnese separatists and the Indonesian military.
There was conflict in Aceh even before I was born.
My grandparents and my parents experienced it.
After the fight for independence,
there was conflict in Aceh until the tsunami on December 26th, 2004.
After the tsunami happened, the conflict stopped completely.
On August 15th, 2005, a peace treaty was signed
and now there is peace in Aceh.
That was a blessing resulting from the tsunami.
The good thing of tsunami.
Rizki has just one regret,
he wasn't able to bury his family.
In my religion, in Islam, the bodies should be buried properly.
I tried to get the bodies so that they could be buried…
for four days.
Four days full,
I tried to save my parents,
my brother, my child’s dead body,
for bury them, but what?
On the fourth day, they all got burned along with other dead bodies.
Although Rizki and Elly was shattered by the death of their only daughter,
they now have three more children.
I’ve had to rebuild my life and think positively.
Why? Because I'm still alive.
So I worked hard and gave it my all and rebuilt my home.
And now I have three children.
Nine, four, and three years old.
I’ve taken them to the ocean
because we live so close to it.
I have told them
about our experience
so that they don’t have to go through
what we went through.
They will already understand.
Unlike us, who didn't know about the tsunami and suffered,
I hope my children and my grandchildren, the future generation,
have better understanding and don’t become victims.
Aceh is transforming now,
and I see it becoming better than it before
probably because many new people are coming to live in Aceh
and that has improved the social life.
Before there were only Acehnese living here,
so anything that was new was not really accepted,
but now that other people are living here, too, the conditions are much better,
and if we want to do something to improve our lives we think, why not?
Elly is now very optimistic about the future for their children.
As far as I can tell, they are growing up very well,
and are not doing anything bad like hitting other children, thank God!
Sometimes I ask my children what they want to be when they grow up.
My son said, "I want to be a cameraman like Dad."
My oldest daughter wants to be a doctor, and the little one wants to be a teacher.
They already have dreams and that makes me very proud
even though we don’t have my parents now, we have my children.
The people who died in the Tsunami Aceh will never be forgotten.
The museum has honored the victims and survivors
by creating a diorama
that shows people frantically trying to flee from the waves.
Another memorial to the disaster
is the huge PLTD Apung 1 power-generating barge
which was swept 500 meters inland
and deposited right in the middle of a residential area.
Phuket has recovered well,
and is once again a tropical playground
where the tourists can enjoy the beaches,
the temples, the food, and the nightlife.
Apple has recently got married
and begun a new life with her husband, Jon.
They live in Malaysia, but often come to Phuket and always visit
the hospital that looked after her.
I feel like I've gotten a new life.
None of my friends were as lucky as me.
My friends lucky as me, not. Just only me.
So I'm thinking like I think before, but made me stronger.
I tell myself to cheer up,
to keep fighting and be healthy.
In Thailand, they have a foundation
that not only helps the victims of the tsunami,
but also helps grieving families of people who have died there
and need help getting their loved ones' remains back to their own countries.
I like to donate and help the people who have passed away
but who have no relatives here. I like to do this very much.
After the tsunami, I am doing it more often.
Apple will never forget the friends she lost on Boxing Day 2004.
When I hear people talking about the tsunami,
I think of my friends and I still miss them.
I think of their families and how they must feel sad, too.
Feel sad it's only me lucky.
Khao Lak is on its way to becoming
one of Thailand's fastest-growing tourist destinations again.
Although the tsunami damaged or destroyed many of the hotels in the area,
they have been rebuilt,
and there is now a variety of accommodation to choose from,
including Franky's small family resort.
Khao Lak has changed
not really a lot compared to how it was before the tsunami.
I would say that the mindset of people has changed.
Of course, it has grown.
We have more hotel beds than we had before the tsunami.
The landscape of Khao Lak also changed a little
but not really much.
You get a different feeling when you come to Khao Lak,
it feels like home, feels like family.
And this has grown stronger over the years, I would say.
Today, there is little sign of the destruction
caused by the tsunami in Khao Lak.
Except for the site of a police boat washed a kilometer inland
that now forms part of a memorial site.
Yeah, this is one of the two police boats
that have been sent to the coastline here
to protect the grandson of the King's family.
And the boat got washed in all the way from the beach
which is about 1.6 kilometers, about one nautical mile.
We are here about, I think it's about 8-9 meters
above sea water level so you can,
you can imagine what the…
You know, how bad it really was.
The chance of another cataclysmic event cannot be overlooked,
so Franky has built his own tower, just in case it happens again.
If it would happen again,
I would be, of course I would react completely differently because
then I know if there's an earthquake,
I would check immediately in the Internet what happened.
Where was the earthquake? What magnitude was it?
Then determine if there's real danger or not and act accordingly.
Here, actually, we see the water tower
which is, at the same time, also a tsunami safety feature
because it has two levels.
And the first level here is where people could gather up
in case there is a tsunami warning,
and if there's really a tsunami coming,
people could climb up the ladder to the upper level
where it's approximately enough space for up to 20 people, I would say.
And the structure is built especially strong,
with columns that would withstand a tsunami.
In Sri Lanka, businesses are being rebuilt and the landscape is recovering.
It may have happened ten years ago,
but the reminders remain, not only in the minds of the locals,
but also in the water-damaged buildings.
Sakthivell still finds it hard to live without his sister
because they weren't just twins,
they were also best friends.
This is the place where I release my grievances.
I get in touch with my lost sister's family
and always live with the memories which I had with them.
Because of that, this is very important
as well as very spiritually touched place,
individually to me, and personally to me.
Whenever I feel…
I'm alone, whenever I feel I am isolated,
whenever I feel I'm frustrated, I used to…
exchange energy, or something like that, with my own sister,
who is missing from me.
So during that kind of feeling, I used to visit that place,
kind of thinking about her a little, alone,
and get some advices or some kind of thoughts in that place.
I'm thinking about her contributions in my life, especially in education,
as well as my, yeah, my lifestyle. She contributed a lot.
She's my part of body, so she knows everything,
and she was able to feel me, coach me,
and carry many burdens from me.
And yeah, I miss that now,
and I'm going to miss her rest of my life.
Go to temple, again,
it's when we were small. Even though we were small,
in our tradition, boys have to stay in boys' panel,
and girls have to stay in girls' side.
So as I told you, she's pretty and she's smart,
and when we go to temple together, we get attention of many people.
That made me proud and that I miss now.
Sakthivell now wants to make sure that his kids
and their school friends know what to do in case
there is another tsunami.
We should really know what kind of things will happen to us.
So education related to natural disaster is important,
and it's the first priority rather than any other education
in the world according to me, because we're talking about our life.
With the passing of time, many memories tied to this tsunami
have been washed away, forgotten or buried.
While the lesson is painful,
we must remember what the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami has taught us.
What basically also teaches us that anything
except our life experiences that we have,
which are like stored in our brain, in our memories,
everything else doesn't really exist, you know.
So it can be gone tomorrow.
I feel really sad.
I want to cry, but, you know, I'm so lucky.
Make me stronger.
Before tsunami, I should say, I have a very professional life.
Selfish, planned life.
But after tsunami, oh, my God, it changed my life. A lot.
We can’t keep regretting what has happened.
Life must go on. Maybe I will become a better person after this.
Those who have survived must keep on living.
Life must go on.
that I'm actually revealing it to anyone at all.
The idea that people would find out was just so horrible to me
that I went to extreme measures to ensure that they don't find out.
People will look at him,
then some of them even give this kind of remark…
Put your legs here.
Just put your legs here. It's alright.
Mummy is just going to be very gentle.
If it's painful, what are you going to say?
Pain, Mama.
Okay.
Pain, Mama.
The real child that I was handling wasn't like a child.
It was like a skinless chicken.
It's just that he's my son.
The term "Butterfly children" is used
because the wings of a butterfly are very, very fragile
and it's the same way how their skin responds to that mild trauma.
The skin just comes off.
Just like butterfly's wings.
I will fight no matter what for my son.
Every morning when I wake up, I have to test out how much I can walk.
Which is a limit that I really cannot exceed,
or else I will have to suffer for it the next day.
Right now, my feet are a little bit sensitive.
Especially on parts like this, it's probably going to blister tonight.
She'd have to miss school on Fridays because Monday to Thursday, she'd walk,
and on Friday, she'll have blistering, so she can't walk at all.
And it would take the entire weekend to recover.
You know this is… a hereditary disease. It's inherited.
When my first child was born, I was extremely thankful he was spared.
With Ira, when we realized that she had it,
there was a sense of depressing inevitability.
So I was born into the world of EB five decades ago.
It was a condition that was completely unknown.
My first three decades of life,
having it classified as a fungal infection,
as a skin eczema and various other things
with no fundamental understanding
and exposed to treatments
which have been completely irrelevant,
useless and baffling.
You choosing to come on camera to share your story, your family's story,
is this a big decision that you had to make?
Absolutely yes.
This is the first time.
When I'm actually revealing it to anyone at all.
Right? Beyond my few close friends and family,
the reason why I have done it is that if we can have the awareness
of this spread across,
maybe more people will come forward.
My pain is not tangible, it's cutting my own skin
and feeling the milliseconds of stinging encased in years of bullying,
taunting and hiding.
Writing is something that has always been there for me to express how I feel.
With EB, it's not something that can be expressed
through words to someone else.
Mostly anger and sadness
and self-pity and all these things that I've…
felt, but never felt comfortable sharing with people.
And so that really encouraged a love of words,
especially about this condition.
So EB or Epidermolysis Bullosa,
is an inherited skin condition
that is due to a deficiency in one of the proteins
that make up the skin.
So these proteins are usually found in the area
called the Dermoepidermal Junction,
which is between the epidermis and the dermis.
So patients who have a deficiency in one of these proteins,
they get blistering from a very young age.
The severity can vary, can be a very mild condition
whereby patients only get the blisters when they walk for far distances.
Patients with very severe forms of EB can die
in infancy or early childhood.
Shoes have always posed a challenge.
When Ira was younger,
I would buy the softest possible shoes I could find.
The most challenging part, I think came when she was
about four years old
when she had to give up her stroller and start walking.
She would inevitably have blisters,
so we bought her a bicycle and we taught her to cycle
before she was five years old.
And she would get some blisters on the palms
from holding onto the handlebars.
That was a really tough time
because she was too young to understand her limits,
so she would pretend that she was okay and try not to draw attention to the fact
that she had a very, very painful condition.
It's always been very important to me to be accepted.
I remember that once I had a mother tongue class
on the sixth floor of my secondary school
and my regular classroom was on the first floor.
So every day we would have to climb six stories of stairs to get there.
And, a lot of the time I would pretend like
I was just going back to class in order to get a book,
when in reality I would run to the lift
and take the lift and go up so my friends didn't know that
I couldn't walk in school.
The idea that people would find out that I can't walk
was just so horrible to me that I went to extreme measures to like…
ensure that they don't find out.
So, Angela is someone I've known for about six years.
Growing up at the age of 18, is kind of a coming of age.
Sharing with my best friend about
something that's really close to my heart is very important.
You know at that point in girls' schools,
it's very exclusive and it's very clique-ish.
And so, like, when one person didn't like the other, like
the whole group would have to, like, not like that person.
And so, like, purely because, like,
you know you were wearing sandals, I felt like you were being excluded
from the other girls because, like…
you weren't wearing shoes and stuff like that.
So it's, like, why, you know.
Why didn't you just, like, in the beginning, just tell people
that you had, like, EB?
I didn't want to be explaining it
to people who don't fully understand me.
And especially people like you and Ruth and my other friends who were really like,
people that I wanted to click with immediately,
people I wanted to just have that like
that typical secondary school experience with
where you just become friends and you just stay friends forever.
And I thought being different,
you know, it might contribute in some way,
it might make our friendship, like, less special to you guys.
She would suffer quietly, but never admit
there was something not quite right.
Repeated contact. repeated friction
in any area would lead to blistering.
Even labels on clothes
would lead to blistering in the region of the label.
So in order to stop it from spreading, from growing,
you have to lance it.
You have to snip off a part of the skin
or you have to prick it in multiple places and drain the fluid.
and then because the skin underneath, that is totally raw,
you have to make sure that you don't put any pressure on it
because it can be agonizing, absolutely agonizing to walk on it.
On school trips like going to Cambodia or going to Sarawak,
whenever I've advised her not to go because she would really struggle,
she's always rejected my advice.
She also shared a room with someone I remember.
And she didn't want to draw attention to the fact that she had blisters.
The entire duration she didn't cut her blisters
because she didn't want her roommate to see it.
And she walked with her blisters.
We went there to teach children, but also to build infrastructure for them.
You know, have a more conducive learning experience to promote education
in underdeveloped countries like Cambodia.
I had gained like an understanding of what it is like to have EB,
and my limits and my boundaries,
and I didn't really want to be held back by that.
I didn't really want to feel like, you know, I can't contribute to society
because of my skin condition.
Even now, I think there's always a struggle between
her wanting to do what she wants to do, and us being the parents we are,
and trying to stop her
from doing things that we know will cause her pain.
I met her in my cousin's wedding.
My first cousin and her first cousin got married.
I think you saw me, you fall in love, right?
I didn't realize him at all.
After we get married,
so we were planning to have a baby after one year,
so God sent to us earlier.
Because I was having my caesarean, right,
so I saw the anesthetist and the surgeon,
was like, shaking their head when the baby came out.
So I thought that my baby was handicapped
or something wrong with my baby definitely.
Because their face, I could see when I was there,
their faces were really shocked.
In my past, I've never carry a baby before.
It's a happy moment for a father to carry their own son.
So when I carry Raed,
I feel something at his neck, like something peel off.
So when I look like, the whole skin in his neck,
his back neck all came out.
She don't know about this, I've never told her
and now I'm telling her that.
I went to the toilet. I cry.
I cried. Seriously, I cried. To see my son skin
on my finger.
And I can feel that moment also, until now I can feel it.
He was in ICU for one month. After one month when he came back,
he falls sick so he needs to be admitted for another two to three weeks.
The bill turned out to be like,
Almost 35,000.
And at the time, he actually had a very resistant bug that was growing.
And we needed to give him intravenous antibiotics
for at least two weeks.
and because his skin was so fragile,
it was extremely difficult to get any intravenous plugs in him.
And every few days we had to change it and you can just imagine how difficult
it is to hold these dressings in place, to keep the plugs in place.
Raed is one of the most severe EB patients in Singapore.
He was born to a family that did not have EB in their family.
The parents both had the gene, but although they were not related,
Raed had the mutation in him and he developed EB.
The pain I can't describe because the real
child that I was handling wasn't like a child.
It was like a skinless chicken.
It's just that he's my son.
And he was on morphine when he was born.
It has to be given for a long period of time.
You have to keep on smiling, isn't it? Good boy.
Doesn't hurt, just a bit, okay?
Alright, okay, done.
Okay, it's alright.
The slightest friction could tear their skin,
which results in an open wound.
If you don't prick the blister, it will develop in a larger area.
So once you break the blister and you drain out the fluid,
that very thin layer of the skin has to be taken care of very carefully.
So it's either you're going to put a piece of dressing over it
to protect it, so that when, there is a certain shift of the skin,
it doesn't cause a trauma to the child.
Pain.
Pain, Mama.
Okay, darling. Mama hear you.
If I could fly, I would soar above the clouds in a clear blue sky
and feel the wind rushing through my hair,
Just like I imagine a bluebird would, high above a rainbow after a storm.
In 2014, there was some scientists like Dr. Birgitte Lane.
She runs a lab that focuses on skin and skin diseases,
and so as someone who is interested in science,
I took a tour of the lab and they offered me
a month long internship with them
to just kind of see what scientists are doing for EB patients.
The main part of my research program was on skin cancer at that time.
So since we came to Singapore
we've been developing this program to look at Epidermolysis Bullosa.
EB is a disease where that skin is not robust enough
to withstand normal wear and tear,
so it breaks a lot. It blisters, it forms sores.
It's a thin layer sitting on the outside.
Underneath that thin layer is a thicker layer of collagen,
which we're more familiar with.
Blood vessels, nerves, and so on. And that's where the break comes.
And that's what EB diseases are.
There's a breakdown between that attachment
to the epidermis, to the collagen.
Currently there is no cure for EB. There is nothing.
And that's what we're really trying to do now,
to see if we can think of a way of using the knowledge
of those mutations to come up with a new therapeutic approach.
The way you would do that is by getting skin cells
to grow in tissue culture,
so then we can start treating these cells with different sorts of drugs
to see if it will restore some greater degree of resilience.
We would like to be able to come up with something that can be used as a therapy.
I think all scientists want this.
They like the idea of coming to Singapore because Singapore is very focused
on translating the research
and getting it out there, turning it into practical outcomes that can be used.
What are you going to eat later?
What are you going to eat later?
You want nasi? Or you want bread?
Bread. Roti.
Roti. Okay.
So basically my wife, she works,
she will go at 7:00 o'clock. She will come back at 4:30.
She will rest for half an hour.
She will start bathing Raed at 5:00.
She will end up at 9:00. At night.
It's all right.
Just imagine you put Raed in the tub for the first time,
the water will turn to red.
He will shout.
You just imagine you having blisters on your body
and the water is all over your body and how painful is that?
When he was just born, we require four person
to be there with us.
Because he didn't have any skin.
It was all flesh and there was a lot of blood.
So the moment we carry him from the bath right,
we have to be really quick
because while we carry him to the dressing area,
there will be drops of blood trickling down the floor.
My helper will be the runner,
means whatever we require.
My mother would be there to pin the baby down.
And then we need like for example, my niece
who distracts him with songs
or with other kinds of animations going on.
So that is how we actually work together.
Twinkle, twinkle little star
How I wonder…
It was too sad to see that. I saw her crying.
When she did the dressing, she would cry.
Sometimes she cried "Why did I get a child like this?"
We have to move forward, and not dwell on the past.
We must take care of this child as best as we can.
This child may grow up to be a good person,
who will help us in the future.
What?
Every month we spend about three to four thousand
when he was born, on the dressing itself.
Because the dressing that we're using for him
are very, very costly.
So like a roll of dressing costs $80,
which is this small and it could last him for only two days.
It's not an easy struggle for me as a warehouse assistant with $1600.
Then I did valet. You just imagine for one year,
you are doing that.
Morning, 5 o'clock, you leave the house.
Morning, 1:00 o'clock, you come back.
I will sleep, per day, four to five hours only.
That is how we go through that one year.
I will fight no matter what for my son.
Few years right, if he's not ready for preschool,
then I am just going to macam teach him at home,
whatever is best for him.
And if required, then,
I will just send him to some playschool.
But if his skin condition doesn't allow us to
send him to school and all that, we just do at home.
To me, I would think about tomorrow, but the mother would think
about five years down the road, ten years down the road,
how he's going to school later
and all this, so I will tell her, relax first.
Relax yourself. Okay, we think…
day by day because
the day he was born and till today is a…
is a total change for Raed.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Now bedek already.
We get more closer, we get more, I mean we understand each other better.
I'll be on her side, she'll be on my side no matter what happen
until our last breath, that's what I can say.
Pig!
How does a pig oink?
Oink! Oink!
-Okay. -Elephant!
I know that this man, I can rely on.
Be it not just for my marriage but throughout any kind of problem.
This, to be honest, like this kind of condition,
not all couples can work together as a team,
but I am blessed that I got that opportunity.
Sometimes I just want to feel invisible to blend in with the masses,
to be just another body amongst the hundreds,
without the contrast of black sandals against white shoes singling me out.
So why are you so nervous about getting extra time?
Why do you always resist it
even though you clearly need the extra time, right?
Because of the fact that I had blistering on my hands,
I had to take extra time for most of my exam papers.
Having extra time
means that I have to sit one corner of the exam hall,
segregated from the rest of my friends very physically.
But your friends already know you have EB, right?
Not my friends, but my
classmates whom I'm not friends with?
So what if they find out you have extra time?
So they'll make assumptions about why I have extra time.
They would feel that you're taking advantage?
I don't know what they'll feel, but they would think badly of me.
Do you think you should stand up?
For yourself?
To who?
The people who just make flash assumptions?
Am I supposed to like,
go out to them and say, I know you just made assumptions about me.
I would need to think about like…
Behaving as though I was disabled, behaving as though
I was in pain, especially during exams, so that people wouldn't think
that I was making a big deal out of it, when in reality, that's not the case.
The extra time is more of a preventive measure
than a real like…
That really took a toll on my emotional and mental health during the papers.
See the bus?
Hot.
Why different color?
-Yeah. -What color?
To be really honest, how we survive in this journey
as a parent of Epidermolysis Bullosa child,
is to really let, like, comments or attitude of people
roll off from us.
People will look at him, walk.
They will walk and look at him and they turn their head.
And the best part, you know what, they will come back and ask,
is it a burn or what?
Then some of them even give this kind of remark like…
It's not our duty to force our child
to really accept this cruel
and harsh society, but I feel that
it's the job of every parents to raise a child
to make this world a less cruel or harsher place to live in.
It begins with anybody who just sees a child
that is not normal like theirs.
Just give them a smile.
You are actually replacing the whole pain and discomfort
that they are actually having to themselves and you,
without you knowing, that smile of yours will in fact give them lots of confidence
to conquer the world.
There's always a stigma related to any skin condition,
especially in conditions that are more severe.
They don't want to share their problems with others.
And I think it's something that's ingrained in our society.
I think in the UK, people are more prepared to talk out, speak out about it.
It's a fairly competitive society here and I think maybe people don't feel
that it's something to shout about if they are disadvantaged.
They feel themselves disadvantaged.
Now, maybe we can encourage people to be more outspoken
and the more public awareness there is,
The more interest there is in promoting this research,
the quicker we'll get to a cure.
Not here where the laundry is!
My skin condition is a lower part of the body from the knee downwards.
It will leave dark scars and blisters.
The condition started to surface is during 12 years old.
My mother told me that this is a genetically passed down
from generation, from my grandmother.
So we don't have any solution so far,
During that time, I just live with it and just only to take care of ourselves.
Try to avoid those of physical contact.
When I was in NS,
I was… downgraded as a police officer.
For the skin condition like that.
The most problem that affect my life would be the social part.
People will start to have a funny kind of stare at my leg,
so I will try to avoid wearing shorts.
So for my case, I like to
show the people that we are not alone and also that
there will be ways in the future.
Would you let us see your skin condition on camera?
No, no. No, no, no, no. Cannot.
Can you explain why?
Because I think it's not pleasant to show on camera.
I fell and skidded.
You skidded? And then?
Over here I got…
Scratches. And how is your leg?
You have this condition and the whole piece of skin can fall off.
My older daughter, so far, her condition is not that bad as mine.
I think maybe it's because she haven't reached to that stage yet.
So for my son, it's also the same.
Those skin medicine I'll buy off the shelf and apply on myself first.
After that I will use it on my children.
Some people are saying that skin condition is
normally due to the blood is not clean.
So some people say that you have to take snake blood.
If I have the snake blood, I will definitely try.
Western medicine, till now I think it's all temporary measure
so it's not a total cure.
So I don't go and consult doctor
to get my dressing and my medicine because it's a waste of time.
When there's already a cure
then I will bring my kids for consultation.
At 8:45, we'll get started with the warmups,
so right now, please give a warm round of applause
to Doctor Ritu Jain, the President of DEBRA Singapore.
EB is characterized by extreme skin fragility,
which results in blistering of the skin.
DEBRA is the international organization
called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association.
We try and find ways to support patients
either by procuring and distributing supplies
that they need for wound care or providing non-material support
like emotional support, conversation, guidance.
We also work with the Institute of Medical Biology.
We try and attract pharmaceutical organizations
to set up clinical trials in Singapore.
So I met Ritu maybe about four years ago.
She was a very strong driving force trying to get more funds in
and with all this increase in funding, they've been able to
support more patients with their dressings and their medical treatment.
…we organize and so these are some of the activities we do
other than the original scientific meeting of pediatric dermatology…
For example, if you have a look at these…
Yes, very nice.
It was a very very successful event…
Dressings are prohibitively expensive because EB is a rare disease.
Because for pharmaceutical organizations, the market is very small.
This little tube of ointment
that works very well for a lot of EB patients.
This costs us $71 dollars in Singapore. It's a five gram tube.
We can't even use our Medisave
to buy dressings and supplies for children.
We get sponsorships from some pharmaceutical organizations.
We do some fundraising. We have some regular donors.
DEBRA has taken like three quarter of our difficulties
in buying the dressing supply.
And being part of DEBRA also builds up my self-confidence,
mixing around with people who have the same issues.
This is from DEBRA, UK. So it's a pocket guide to EB and…
It's very easy and patients can carry it
and they can show it to teachers or caregivers.
Yeah, this is more for pocket guide, but for teachers and all that,
it will be very useful if you give them posters
and a bit of more comprehensive details
but not too overwhelming.
We're going to do our best to find ways to help
every single patient, regardless of whether
they are citizens or foreigners.
But, in itching it's not helping.
So there's a lot of itching.
It's not helping anymore, yes.
Yeah, so she is making the blisters worse because she's scratching.
You can see the neck.
You can see the neck area.
Yeah.
The wounds are bad, yeah?
She only itches herself all the time.
I found out that there are some families in Pakistan.
The child was in a very bad condition, losing a lot of blood.
The dressings were sticking to his wounds
and when they took off the wounds to bathe him,
they were taking off skin with it.
We tried to also send some dressings.
But since these were considered medical supplies, nobody would carry them.
Finally,
FedEx agreed to take it.
They arrived in Islamabad and Customs wanted about $700 U.S. dollars
to release those dressings.
Of course the family can't afford that.
I woke up one morning and I had a message from the father.
Ma'am,
my child died last night.
So the dressings are still
with customs, but the child is no more.
So some battles you win, some you lose.
It makes me angry in some ways that I'm not able to do what she does.
As someone with EB,
the responsibility's really with me and she's my mom.
So she will take on the responsibility
that I don't take on or that
she thinks she needs to do for me, and…
that's why I feel like she pushes herself too much.
It's because it's not her job.
It's mine and that's why I've been trying to take on a more active role in DEBRA.
Now that she's doing so many things,
I'm extremely happy, so I ask her,
"Is the work you are doing giving you fulfillment?"
And as long as the answer is yes,
I am completely supportive of it.
I long for the pain of skin that has been broken in a warm, loving embrace,
because the pain that comes from exposed nerves
is far less than the pain of being touch starved.
So we arrived five years ago because of the work of my husband.
For us it was a new adventure. We were happy to leave everything.
Here's where I live, in Singapore.
When I come to Singapore, I was three or four years old.
We come from France.
It's very near to Paris.
My name is Lorraine. I'm eight years old.
I am in grade three.
I am in a French school.
In Singapore, we can swim a lot but not in France.
In France we can do ski but not in Singapore.
I think that it was difficult when we arrived in Singapore
because in France, most of the time you are wearing pants.
You know, you put things that nobody can see,
so you just have a normal life and nobody ask you
and only the close family
when you're during their vacation can see that you have.
The thing is that now they can manage themselves and…
if it's okay, they don't do anything.
If it's painful, they know, and sometimes one of them just ask me,
"Okay, can you help me to do my bandage?"
The problem with their toe nails is that they are very fragile,
and if they have a bump
that breaks the toe nails, they will not grow again.
In Singapore, most of the time you are not wearing shoes, so…
I know it is a bit complex for them.
Moving in Singapore introduced lots of change, a big change
because the first thing is to realize that they have something different.
How was your day?
Because it was the first day back to school,
there were new teachers.
Did you tell her about the Epidermolysis Bullosa?
-No. -No, you didn't?
There are new kids. Have some of them asked you questions?
Yes, actually not the first day.
And what did they ask you?
What do you have?
Because they could only see my knees.
It's just that I'm getting a little tired when one person,
followed by another, is asking me what I have.
Then someone else asking, "What do you have?"
After a while, it is a little irritating.
I want them to understand that I'm just the same as them,
but I just have blisters.
I try also to explain to them that it is life.
And in France, we are very lucky because this disease is known.
And so when you have that kind of disease that is genetic,
you are 100% covered by welfare insurance
so we don't have to pay anything.
Their medical supplies are all free by the government.
If these kids they're going to school with wheelchair and all that,
they have community nurses that…
…assist this child throughout their duration in school
and it's all being paid for.
It's well covered overseas.
So I really hope that in the years to come,
we'll get support from the government.
I'd like to believe that
the development and strength of a country is measured
by the amount of help and support it gives to its weakest, not by its GDP.
You like, straighten your hair then you… yeah, you do that.
You go around the whole thing because the outside is also warm.
Because like, my hair is so thin, right, it will just fall off.
That's exactly what happened.
Today is my first prom.
It's very special because it's a very big milestone in my life.
I'm excited to get ready and dressed up
and look nice with my friends
and take lots of pictures and have a nice night.
No, no. It doesn't. It really doesn't. Like my knuckles don't crack.
This is kind of my first chance to wear proper adult kind of high heels
and so I really wanted it to be like,
not something that a little girl would wear.
I still think about like, my blisters
and I was actually choosing between this and another pair
of like black and gold heels that really match my dress
and I think they were much nicer, but they were really uncomfortable
and overall in the long run
they would have not been good to my feet and my skin in general.
So I'm trying to get her to wear my shoes
and of course she wants to go and buy her own shoes.
And I know that is going to give her terrible blisters the day after her prom.
She's not going to be able to walk.
Enjoy yourself.
-Go fly. Go fly! -Just ruined my make-up, mom.
Good job.
So what time did it start?
Started at 7:00.
And where was this?
It was at the Regent Hotel.
All the teachers were there, and my entire cohort was there.
And everybody looked really nice.
Prom was fun. Yeah, it was really good.
We like, went and booked a room in the hotel we had prom in.
And all my friends were in that room
helping me decide like, what shoes to wear.
They kept telling me, like,
you know, don't do something stupid that you're going to regret. And…
Prom is not about looking your best,
it's about feeling your best and it's about having a good time.
And as a result, I don't have as many blisters
as I probably would have gotten with the other shoes.
I feel that she is ready to take that journey.
She is going to go to college next year
and she might go to a college in a faraway place.
I would like to use this as an opportunity
to give her an exposure to a few years of EB-free life.
If she was in a cold climate, then she'd be able to walk a lot more.
She'd be able to be a lot more active
without having painful blisters.
They know that if they fall, it will be
more painful than for another kid, but I think the most important
is that they have the life they want to have and…
I hope also that the science will make progress.
And I have read in the newspaper that graft of skin was performed,
so we know that we are lucky to be in a society that progress
is going very fast.
So they're taking cells from the patient.
And they've grown them in tissue culture.
And then they've corrected the gene so that the cells are apparently normal.
And then they've grown these cells so they have a lot of them
and they graft these back on the patient in the areas
where they've got these extensive loss of skin.
Two years down the line from that grafting and the skin looks very good.
The challenge is that this is usually going to be
something that's so expensive,
that it's not going to be very widely available.
But anyway, it's a very, it's a very promising start, yes.
One of the constant challenges in working on rare diseases
is of course that you have a very small number of people that are affected.
And therefore, even if you develop a very compelling therapeutic approach,
it's never going to be a multi-million pound drug
because there just aren't that many people who were affected.
There's no doubt about the huge medical need for these people,
but they're just small in number.
In this patient, the collagen 7 gene is missing.
Basically their skin gets wounded over and over again
and eventually, the cells become cancerous.
So what we want to do is to give this patient collagen 7
so that now they can anchor
the top layer to the bottom layer so it doesn't peel off.
We are taking the approach to help replace
the missing protein in the patient
and we hope that this will improve their quality of life.
I'm very enthusiastic about my work, and we are very confident
it would help this patient.
In the best case scenario,
we are looking to go to a clinical trial within two years.
Even if we don't find a cure.
I really hope that we can find better ways of alleviating the pain
and the suffering of our patients with EB.
And really returning them to normal life,
that's what I hope to see in all of my patients.
When they will be a little older and when they are going to be in love
and to be more sensitive to their leg,
and perhaps it will be a little bit more complicated.
We will see at the moment how we can manage.
I will definitely hope that the people outside
will try to accept our EB, the skin condition problem,
will not look down on those people with skin problems.
She will start working, she'll become independent,
and then she'll start living as an adult.
And I think that's something that worries me the most.
The sad truth is that life isn't going to get easier for you
just because you have EB.
It's going to be the same as it is for everyone,
just that you have to try harder to deal with it and to get by.
I hope that her condition makes her more compassionate of others
who don't fit the norm.
And I hope she grows into a caring and giving woman
who learns that she still has a capacity to give back.
I want to become a researcher, a scientist,
someone who can hopefully make a significant contribution
to the pharmaceutical industry in terms of how I can help
bridge the gap between scientists and patients,
especially in the EB world.
Raed, are you ready for the swing?
Ten percent is what the world gives you,
but 90% is how you are going to react
to what the challenges of the world throws on you.
Don't always think that other people are more blessed than you and you are not.
Because the truth is,
everybody are all blessed differently.
And most importantly,
don't die before you are even dead.
If I could change the world, I would make people have skin
of all the colors of the rainbow,
because that way I wouldn't be the only different one.
Good morning, guys. It's me, Padgett Head to Toe here,
where we talk about makeovers, self-improvement,
and how to become the most spectacular you you can be.
Now, as I always say when it comes to makeovers,
it's your insides that count.
But your outsides are the first thing people see.
I didn't get my full eight last night because I was up studying,
and as some of you saw,
baking some super delicious treats.
So, this morning's routine is going to take a little bit extra effort.
Wow, okay. You guys have already asked a lot of questions.
So let's dive right in.
CandyLaLa09, cute name by the way,
wants to know how my morning routine is different after a late night.
Great question, Candy.
These Bunny Venom revival eye patches are always my fav for eye puff.
I had coffee last night, which is super dehydrating,
so I'll work in some Alo Head-to-Toe Glow Oil
to get rid of the dryness and add a whisper of cream blush.
Okay, ZoeWorld88 says she has a giant zit,
and they're taking her senior pictures in two days. Poor thing.
Rule number one, never try to pop it with your fingers.
Apply a warm compress.
Oh! DIY quick fix, take some soft toilet paper,
a little toothpaste,
dab it on. Dries it right out.
-Hey, another late night? -Ah, 7:00 to 7:00.
-Hmm, how was it? -Well, let's see.
We had, hmm, two heart attack victims,
a toddler with a watch battery stuck in her nose.
-Oh my gosh. -[Mom] Yeah.
And a gentleman on meth with a stab wound to the neck.
Yikes! What a nightmare.
Yeah, it was pretty awful. They were just thrashing around,
cursing at everyone, spitting on the orderlies.
-Man, meth really messes you up. -Oh no, that was the toddler.
Yeah. The guy on meth actually seemed really sweet.
Until he smiled.
His teeth, ugh… Pretty rough.
[gasps] Yes! [singsong] I've been waiting for this!
Almost $3,000 for, um…
Tell me what you do again?
I'm just mostly kidding.
But I just hope that some of it goes towards your college fund.
-Not more of-- -[Padgett] Mom.
Those shoes cost more than our dishwasher.
These are Bunny Venom comps. Totally free.
Which reminds me, do you have any idea how my bill from the plumber got paid?
Oh! Yeah, I Venmo'd the repairman.
-Honey. -What?
I saw the bill on the counter.
I figured, I mean, you work so hard to keep us in the school district.
Yes, this amazing school district full of snotty, entitled trust funders.
Hey, some of my best friends are entitled trust funders.
Exactly. And then you feel this tremendous pressure to keep up.
You want me to go to a college full of entitled trust funders.
And I'm actually late to meet the ones who drive me to school every day.
-Love you. [kiss] -Mm.
Bye.

Oh, please tell me those aren't what I think they are.

Croquembouche with white cream filling. I saw your story.
From scratch. And I made them with almond flour

He's being ironic, I think.

Why do you listen to that crap all the time?
Jordan Van Draanen's music is not crap. You haven't even heard his other songs.
Okay, what are his other songs?
He hasn't recorded them yet.
You act like you're so above it all, but I think you're just jealous.
Of what?
Jordan's this super popular guy in your grade, and you're just a…
A fountain of truth in a world of bullshit?
-Yes, you're welcome. -[Brin] Ugh.

[man on PA] Attention Cali High Earthquakes,
this is Principal Bosch announcing this year's prom theme, Under the Sea,
which really doesn't make sense because technically you'd be in the sea,
which really doesn't make sense because technically you'd be in the sea, not under it,
but it's the committee's decision, and I support them.
Dude. -You cleaned out all the Sun Chips. -Uh-huh. Yeah. So?
-You cleaned out all the Sun Chips. -Uh-huh. Yeah. So?
-Where'd you get that shirt? -I found it.
-In your truck. -Hmm.
What? It looks better on me, man.
Yeah, sure. I'm gonna start stealing your stuff.
So, what's on the sched for the weekend?
Um, I have work Friday, and then we have
that Jimmy Wang double feature at the New Beverly, right?
The same double feature we saw last weekend?
No. That was Johnny Wang, all right?
Jimmy's Taiwanese, Johnny's Chinese. Totally different.
Right. Sounds like more sweaty dudes kicking each other in the nads.
How about we see my friend Jada's band? She's opening for Bunker Mose at The Door.
Isn't she the one who tried to hit me with her ukulele?
You called her music twee and derivative.
Well it is.
Look, I gave her a compliment for keeping her songs under two minutes.
Oh my God. Seriously.
She acts like she doesn't even know me.
That's just because she's tremendously ashamed of you.
Hi, little sis!
Did you get your Lunchables?
Oh, don't forget to take your laxatives too!
-The doctor says you need to stay regular! -[Brin] Shut up!
Oh my God.
You're so evil, you know that?
Um, did you talk to your parents about our trip?
'Cause I was thinking, what if we start in Portugal
instead of Spain,
and then we make our way up north from there.
Well, wherever we do end up,
as long as we get back by August for my orientation.
UC Riverside, really?
What? I think I'd do really well there without having to work very hard.
Plus, it's near Legoland.
I effing love Legoland.
Isn't UCSD the one near Legoland?
I think I made a huge mistake.
This is so cool. I've never been on the set of a music video before.
[woman] Try working on one. We're an hour behind, wardrobe just quit,
and I am 90% sure I'm getting pink eye.
-Ew. -Jordan's trailer's this big one here.
Make it fast. We're calling him to set soon.
Okay, we'll do it live.
When I cue you, press this and follow me inside.
Yep, I know how to work a phone. -Thanks. -And action.
-Thanks. -And action.
Okay, guys. We're live here, and surprise!
We're on the set of Jordan's brand-new video in beautiful Hollywood, California.
-[coughs] Canoga Park. -Same thing.
[giggles] I can't wait to see his face.
-[knocking] -Hello?
-[music playing] -Wow. He's really blasting that music.
Is he listening to himself?
Yeah. So?
Come on.
-[Padgett] Jordan? -[music playing loudly]
-Jordan! -Padgett?
-[girl] Padgett! -What are you doing?
What do you think they're doing?
-Okay, let's not freak out here. Okay? -Oh my God. I'm so, so sorry.
I have no idea how this happened.
Padgett, I'm such a big fan.
I'm Aniston, by the way.
Your name is Aniston?
It's a family name.
Well, you've made them very proud.
-Thank you. -[Padgett] Ugh!
-You scumbag! -Padge.
I made you croquembouche!
I even made them with almond flour
so you wouldn't fart during your precious video!
-Check this out. -[Padgett] I can't believe you!
Is this why you told me not to visit the set?
So you could hook up with the backup dancer?
Oh my God! [laughing]
I think I just saw Jordan Van Draanen's thing.
-[Padgett] Aniston is not a first name! -Not too shabby, JVD.
[Padgett grunts] I hate you!
-After everything we've been through? -[Jordan] Padgett!
We're over, okay?
Know what? You don't deserve me, my love, and you don't deserve my croquembouche.
-You croquem-douche! -[girl 2] Padgett!
What?! [gasps]
You're still live.
Padgett, you feeling okay? Missing school today?
[Padgett groans] Mom, I'm fine.
I just wanna be alone.
I went through all the trouble of putting cereal in a bowl with milk.
[Padgett] Lucky Charms? Mom--
I know it's not really what you eat anymore,
but it cheered you up when you were eight.
Look, I'm just not hungry, okay?
Suit yourself. [spoon taps]
Hmm! Wow. The marshmallows.
-I forgot about the marshmallows. -Mom.
Give me a break. I've been eating Mueslix for ten years.
Look, honey,
I do know that breakups are hard, especially your first.
It's not just the breakup.
I was humiliated.
I know that it feels like the absolute end of the world now,
but I can promise you with absolute certainty
that it will get better.
Well, when?
Three months.
Maybe a year. Five tops.
Even if it's just you and me for the rest of our lives,
what do we do?
We get a couple of twin beds, fierce matching jumpsuits,
a couple dozen more cats.
It would be great.
-Think about it. -[Padgett sighs]
-Hey. -There you are. I was so worried.
-We missed you at dance practice. -Sorry, I saw you called.
-We missed you at dance practice. -Sorry, I saw you called. -I've kinda just been-- -Avoiding life? Can't say I blame you.
-I've kinda just been-- -Avoiding life? Can't say I blame you.
Why did I have to go live?
And why did Alden keep recording?
Because you always go live, and Alden must have been in shock.
Yeah, well, at least everyone got to see what an asshole Jordan is.
Yeah, I guess.
You guess?
No! I mean, yes. You're totally right.
-Yes. -Q, what's going on?
Nothing.
It's just, I guess you haven't looked online today?
[Quinn] Padgett? Hello? Are you still there?
I think I'm gonna be sick. How could this happen?
[Quinn] A few people are being kind of mean.
A few?
Bubble Girl?
Who's Bubble Girl?
[clears throat] You are?
How am I Bubble--
Oh my God.
Padgett, listen to me, okay? Everything's going to be just fine.
How could you say that? I'm a joke.
I'm a punchline with a disgusting mucus-themed nickname. I'm--
-Oh no. -[Quinn] Who is it?
It's Jessica Miles Torres from Bunny Venom.
Jessica, hi. What's up?
You're going viral in the wrong way.
Okay, so you saw the video, and while it is unfortunate…
Unfortunate? My ex-husband's hiking accident was unfortunate,
and he was mauled by bears.
Oh my God. Is… is he okay?
Better than you.
But, honey, I get it. I can sympathize.
You were betrayed, mistreated, humiliated.
So you do understand?
Of course. The difference is you completely lost it in front of, like…
Of course. The difference is you completely lost it in front of, like… A lot of people. I know.
[Jessica] According to my assistant, 217,463.
Look, we pay you because you're the makeover girl.
People buy products that you recommend.
And I'm still that girl.
[Jessica] No. You're a meme.
You're Bubble Girl.
And mucus is just not on-brand for us.
But I'm sure you can get another endorsement.
Maybe with an antihistamine company?
So wait, you're pulling my sponsorship? That's really problematic for my college.
Listen, people want Padgett Head to Toe. -Not Head to Nose. -I know I've lost a lot of followers.
-Not Head to Nose. -I know I've lost a lot of followers.
But I can get them back. I just need a chance to redeem myself.
-That's all. -Sweetie, I am your biggest supporter.
No one has more faith in you than I do.
But until you turn things around, don't talk to me. Love ya.
Look, no one feels worse for Padge than I do.
But you gotta admit, she kind of brought it on herself.
You're saying she deserved it? -Jordan humiliated her. -Okay, I did not say "deserved."
-Jordan humiliated her. -Okay, I did not say "deserved."
But after years of this 4.0, hot boyfriend,
But after years of this 4.0, hot boyfriend, Insta-perfect corporate sponsor streak, something had to give.
Insta-perfect corporate sponsor streak, something had to give.
-What had to give? -Uh, Padge, hi.
Hi.
We thought you might be taking a personal day.
No, I'm fine.
Hey, Bubble Girl.
-You need me to pop that thing for you? -Back off, sleazeball!
-Wow. Unbelievable. -[students laugh]
I'm the victim.
How is Jordan not a complete pariah now?
I checked his profile earlier, and his numbers are actually going up.
Okay, that's ridiculous.
I mean, who the hell does he think he is?
When I first met him, his real name was Jordan Dickman.
A hundred-twenty pounds of bad skin and tragic hair.
-Oh my God, and those clothes. -[laughs]
The popped collars and that hideous rope necklace?
Remember how he started every conversation with, "Yo, yo, what's the haps?"
-What's the haps? -[laughing]
God. I know it sounds conceited, but makeovers are my thing.
-Exactly. -And I made that guy.
Oh, really?
So then why don't you just make another Jordan?
[Bosch] Attention Earthquakes, the big night's coming.
Don't forget to vote online for your prom king and queen,
a tremendous honor they'll always remember.
Unless they throw up in their date's shoe in the limo and remember that instead.
Kidding. Just kidding.
That's it!
You're gonna create another internationally renowned egomaniac?
No, but I will create the next prom king.
-Just to piss off Jordan? -Hm, pissing off Jordan will be a bonus.
This will be me proving that once again, I can take anything or anyone
This will be me proving that once again, I can take anything or anyone and make them popular. And once we win prom king and queen,
and make them popular. And once we win prom king and queen,
I'll get back all my followers and my sponsorship.
-Wow, you make it sound easy. -You don't think I can do it?
No. But I do think it'll be fun watching you try.
A bet?
Not just a bet. The bet.
-You know, the one we always talked about? -[Quinn] Um, guys?
-You know, the one we always talked about? -[Quinn] Um, guys? That sounds a little extreme.
-Are you sure that's a good idea? -Sure. It'll make it more fun when I win.
Okay.
-Okay, I'm in. -Good. [giggles]
Now I just have to pick the guy.
You? No, no, no. See, that's the fun part.
Just so you don't make it too easy on yourself,
we'll pick the loser.
-[scoffs] -Come on.
Oh. Perfect.
Lucas Fletcher? He's a criminal.
-He's conning those poor 9th graders. -[Quinn] Yeah.
It's probably just kale chips. Everybody knows not to trust Lucas.
Intriguing. He does have a pretty badass car
and a lot of female followers.
I mean, the danger factor can be attractive.
-[Alden] Yeah. -[all laugh]
-Next. -No.
[man] Ladies and gentlemen, today we'll be discovering…
-How about him? -[Quinn] Sebastian Woo?
Lose the lab coat, put product in his hair, who knows?
It says here he just sold an app to a big gaming company.
He's gonna be like shoot-cars-in-space rich.
…using a mixture of both.
-[music ends] -Kweller, what the hell are you doing?
Taking pictures of what the wastrels at this school throw away.
-So, now you're photographing garbage? -Okay, come on.
Look, I mean, there's a perfectly untouched orange
Look, I mean, there's a perfectly untouched orange next to a discarded math textbook. I mean, it speaks volumes, right?
next to a discarded math textbook. I mean, it speaks volumes, right?
Does it?
[Quinn] Hey, what about him?
Oh, that's Cameron something.
Kweller, I think?
Let's see. Weird. He's nowhere to be found.
Wait, he made one tweet in 2019, and all it said was, "No."
It's like he doesn't exist.
[Padgett] He kinda just seems like he hates everybody.
-Except for her. -Nisha Mandyam.
-I always thought they were dating. -Doubtful.
-I always thought they were dating. -Doubtful. Pretty sure she's gay.
-Oh! My bad, bro! -[boy laughs]
Fascists!
He is a total disaster.
Weird, arrogant, antisocial.
-[both giggle] -[sighs] Great.
Scumbags. That's it. We should totally get those guys.
-No. -So sick of them.
-They can't help their reptile brains. -Are you serious?
Besides, I like to think of myself more as a pacifist.
I'm sorry. You? A pacifist?
Well, I may have occasionally been a little… provocative.
Ya think?
Put a shirt on, dude.
I don't want to stare at your underwear while I eat, dirtbags.
You posers call this music?
-Please. -Get off my stage.
I don't know. Maybe you could tone it down a bit?
Uh, no. They're assholes, and I remind them that they are.
It's my place in the ecosystem.
Cam, that's Padgett Sawyer.
[Padgett] Hi.
Cameron, right?
-Yeah, can I help you with something? -I'm Padgett.
Um, we were in Señora Parker's Spanish class together? -Remember? -Uh, yeah.
-I guess so. -[chuckles] Hola.
Hi.
Good times.
Wait, um, where you going?
-I thought you were finished. -Uh, no. Sorry.
I was just wondering, uh…
you're a photographer, right?
Yeah.
So the Cali High car wash is next week--
-No. -You didn't let me finish.
I'm sorry. Yes, please finish.
-We need someone to take pictures for-- -No.
-But it's a fundraiser. -For what?
Is it cancer research or homelessness?
-Actually, the prom. -Okay. [laughs]
[giggles nervously] Is that funny?
No, it's sad, actually, but, um, good luck with that.
Oh my--
I'm so sorry about him. He's literally like that with everybody.
-How do you know him? -He's my brother. Just by blood though.
If you don't mind, I'd rather not publicize it.
Sorry, I don't think I know--
Oh, um, Brin Kweller, sophomore.
I just have to say, I think you're amazing.
I mean, it sucks what happened to you. Jordan is such a dick.
Unless you're getting back together with him?
-No. It's fine. -Because in that case…
He is a dick.
Is your brother one too?
[scoffs] Um, no, not a dick,
but he does tend to be a bit misanthropic?
I sensed that.
Uh, so if he doesn't like people, what does he like?
Oh, huh, let's see.
Photography, allegedly.
Allegedly?
No one ever gets to see any of his pictures, so…
What about music?
Only weird, old stuff, no one else listens to,
like the Bad Brains, Bad Religion.
Really just anything with "bad" in the name.
Wow. Uh, what about movies?
Same thing.
Everything's Kurosawa, kung fu, or Kubrick.
Oh, my. That is a lot of K's.
So, um, [clicks lips] why are you suddenly so interested in my brother?
Don't get me wrong, I love him and all, but that's just 'cause I have to.
Uh, curiosity, I guess?
Horses.
-I'm sorry? -He loves horses.
He works every day before school at Will Rogers Park.
So like a cowboy, huh?
No, more like a horse girl.
He kind of cried when he found out unicorns weren't real.
Cameron. What a weird coincidence.
Uh, well, I'm here every morning, so…
I'm pretty sure the only weird part is you.
Fair enough.
I was hoping to take a riding lesson this morning.
And I figured since you and I are friends--
-Ah, friends? -In the sense we go to school together.
Kind of a loose definition. Don't you think?
Uh, look, I have a lot of work to get done before school--
So let me help! Then if there's time afterwards,
we can squeeze in a lesson.
-You don't even know what the job is. -That's okay. I am at your service.
Ugh! There's just so much of it. [gags]
What do horses eat anyway?
[Cameron] Well, that one, Jimbo over there, he likes Chipotle.
Gilly prefers sushi.
Just horse feed. Hay, grass mostly.
Well, this one must have eaten an entire soccer field.
Well, you offered to help.
I'm starting to think you've never shoveled crap before.
Only out of a litter box.
And this dump is bigger than my cat.
So, you really come here every day before school?
Yep, ever since I was 14.
Wow, you really want to chronicle your post-poop clean-up look?
I chronicle everything. That's my job.
So, how about that lesson now?
I guess a deal's a deal.
So, do you have any previous riding experience?
Just one time at a birthday party when I was five,
but I think it was a baby horse,
or maybe not baby, but it was small. [chuckles nervously]
Does that count?
I believe the word you're looking for is pony and no.
[inhales] Anyway, this is Gilly. He can be a little temperamental, so I--
[inhales] Anyway, this is Gilly. He can be a little temperamental, so I-- -What are you doing? -I'm letting him smell my hand.
-What are you doing? -I'm letting him smell my hand.
It's like a handshake for horses. I did my research last night. [chuckles]
-[soft neighing] -Whoa. Why is he doing that?
Actually means he likes you.
Oh, well, I guess he has good instincts.
Right.
Let's, um, try mounting up. So come over here.
Put your left foot in the stirrup, grab the reins with your left hand,
and use your other leg to haul you up and over.
-I'm a natural, right? -Not bad.
[Cameron] Um, seriously? -More? -I'm just capturing the moment. [chuckles]
-More? -I'm just capturing the moment. [chuckles]
You can't enjoy this without sharing it with 500 strangers?
Five hundred? Try 887,132.
And they're not strangers. They're followers.
Followers? You mean like a cult?
No, not like a cult.
Just people devoted to me and totally guided by my advice as to how to live their lives.
I'm joking. I was just taking a picture.
-You take pictures. What's the difference? -Too vast to even explain.
Now, come on off the horse.
-That's it? We're done? -No.
I just want you to practice getting on and off.
Oh, uh, okay.
-Whoa! -Whoa. Hold on. Hold on.
-Disgusting! -[laughs hysterically] Sorry!
Sorry for laughing.
It's just I've never seen such an uncoordinated dismount.
I mean, aren't you captain of the dance team--
What? It's mostly grass, right?
[Bosch] Attention Earthquakes, a reminder to buy your prom tickets,
where the dance team will be performing their annual dance presentation.
A tradition I still don't understand, but it's the committee's decision,
A tradition I still don't understand, but it's the committee's decision, and I support them.
…instead of starting in Portugal, we start in Amsterdam.
Uh, Kweller, can we maybe do this later? I have a French quiz.
These are the best fares I've seen in months.
Just, um, give me your phone.
-What's wrong with yours? -Really?
Your aversion to technology is becoming a character flaw.
Hey, guys.
Uh… hey?
I wanted to say thank you for this morning.
My butt is so sore. I could barely walk.
Things got messy.
Uh, context, please?
-I gave her a riding lesson. -I bet you did.
Horse riding.
-Mm-hmm. -Part of one, anyway.
And as a way of saying thanks, there is a karaoke party this Saturday
And as a way of saying thanks, there is a karaoke party this Saturday at my friend Quinn's house, and I was hoping you guys could come.
at my friend Quinn's house, and I was hoping you guys could come.
-Uh, yeah. Um, I don't… I don't-- -We'll be there.
Perfect. So Cameron, should I like, SMS you the address?
Kweller's phone is an antiquated piece of crap.
-Why don't you send it to me? -Awesome. Okay.
-Okay, I'll see you guys tomorrow. -[Nisha] Totally.
What the hell?
You've been talking about wanting to go on all these exotic adventures.
Why don't you just think of this as an adventure close to home.
Oh, wow. It's a pool party.
-Why didn't you tell me? -'Cause nobody told me.
What are we even doing here? -You know. Come on. -Wh-- wh-- wh-- Whoa!
-You know. Come on. -Wh-- wh-- wh-- Whoa!
Eating free Pizza Hut is what we're doing.
Besides, when do you get to make fun of these guys in their own natural habitat? [chuckles]
-That's true. -I mean, exhibit A.
Now that is rough. [chuckles]
Yeah, it sounds like they're constipated,
but for some reason, they're happy about it.
-[Padgett] Great! You guys came. -Yes, we did.
Yeah. This is cool. You do this often?
It's kind of a pre-prom thing, so we can work on our tans.
But I'm going to college in New York, so won't be doing this next year.
But I'm going to college in New York, so won't be doing this next year. -Where you guys going? -Uh, yeah.
-Where you guys going? -Uh, yeah. I'm kind of opting out of that whole thing.
Oh, like a gap year?
Yes, exactly like a gap year, followed by another gap year,
and then a gap life.
-Kweller doesn't believe in college. -Really?
-Kweller doesn't believe in college. -Really? Well, I believe it exists. I just think it's a huge waste of time and money.
Well, I believe it exists. I just think it's a huge waste of time and money.
So, any idea what you're gonna sing? Everybody's got their go-to karaoke song.
-Right? -No.
Lemme guess. You're gonna opt out of the whole singing thing too?
Wow! Thank you, ladies.
I can't tell you how much I enjoyed that performance.
Nobody can.
-[scoffs] -[DJ] All right, who's up next?
Padge Sawyer!
-Guess it's my turn. Wish me luck. -[crowd cheers]
[DJ] All right, nowhere to go but up from there.
-We gotta see this. -["Teenage Dream" playing]
Wow. I don't even know why she bothers with college.
She might as well just get her residency in Vegas, am I right? ♪ Don't ever look back ♪
Oh my God.
What?
You're enjoying this?
You're enjoying her.
What? No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm--
-[girl] Oh my gosh, that's Jordan. -Are you serious?
What? I invited him. I didn't think he'd show up with her. [Jordan] Hey!
[Cameron] What's going on?
Jordan's her ex. He totally humiliated her in front of a zillion people.
Oh my gosh. She's dying up there.
Wait. Kweller.
I really don't think you should go! Kweller, this is a truly awful idea!
All right, Kweller.
-That's the bet guy? -Yeah.
Who is this dude?
They're actually kinda good.
They got all that on camera.
-That was actually amazing. -Yeah. I know, right?
Thanks for having my ass. I mean, saving my back.
Having my back.
And I'm pretty sure that is my cue to call for a car.
No, um, uh, don't do that. We'll give you a ride.
-We will? -Yeah. It's no problem at all.
-Can I get some KFC to go? -Yeah, sure.
Awesome.
-Bye. -♪ …of Pali ♪ ♪ Little freaks in they jeeps don't play ♪
You know, you should really rethink that whole no-singing policy.
You have a really great voice.
Cameron was in the Glee Club. What?
-I didn't know it was a secret. -Glee Club? At Cali?
-No, no. -I didn't think Cali had--
It was at my old school back in Wyoming.
It was either play football or cow tipping.
-Or Glee Club. Yeah. -Or Glee Club? [chuckles]
I get it. Oh, this is me.
[Nisha] This is you? My cousin lives here.

I hope it wasn't too, you know, weird.
That's okay. Weird's totally our thing.
-[chuckles] Okay, then. See you later. -See ya.
-Hey, Padge. -Yeah?
I gotta say, even though you're incredibly hot,
you're not the complete monster that I thought you'd be.
Uh, thanks?
But Cameron is like a brother to me.
So, I have to say, if you do anything to hurt him,
I'll put a croquembouche in your croquem-face. You feel me?
Uh, okay.
Don't forget.
I really like her.
[Brin] Oh, look who's up.
How was your Saturday?
Uh, it was okay. Why?
Do anything interesting?
Not really.
Well, more than 2.6 million TikTok viewers beg to differ!
-[coughs] Ugh! -Are you kidding me?
Why didn't you tell me you had a date with Padgett Sawyer?
Trust me. It wasn't a date. The whole thing was a freakish aberration.
Okay, a person who is way out of your league is spending time with you.
-Take the win and claim it as a date. -[phone vibrates]
And speak of the devil herself. [gasps]
-Padgett, hey. -[Padgett] Brin.
Hi. Uh, sorry to bother you, but I think I left something

Oh, yeah, no problem.
Yo, we were just talking about you.
He's standing right in front of me. Do you wanna talk to him?
[Padgett] I was hoping I could swing by now.
Uh, yeah, sure. When do you wanna come?
Oh, like now, now.
Okay. Yeah, hold on.
You might wanna change.
-Jessica. Hi. -[Jessica] Hey, Padgett.
Saw the duet. 2.6 million views!
Who's the new guy? A little scruffy but cute.
Well, just wait until I'm done with his makeover.
Ooh, go on.
I'm gonna make him more popular than Jordan Van Draanen.
[Jessica] Really? Well, if you do that, then we're back in business.
I'll believe it when I see it. Love ya.
-[line disconnects] -Love ya!
Thanks again. These things are always slipping out of my bag.
Yeah, it's no problem.
Since I'm already here, I was wondering if--
-What's all this stuff? -Uh, it's from Dad. Just got here.
Uh, great.
-Gifts? What's the occasion? -Nothing. It's stupid.
Our dad lives in Sweden, and once a year, he sends us these all-in-one presents.
Kind of like Christmas and Hanukkah and our birthdays all smushed together.
[Cameron] Seriously?
A doorstop?
Hmm, coloring books, Legos, and Swedish Helga Barbie.
Quite a haul if you're eight.
-At least he's trying. -I disagree.
Well, it's the thought that counts, right?
-Not that it's my business. -Um, did you need something else?
Actually, yeah. I was hoping you could give me another riding lesson.
-When? -Now?
Now?
Um, yeah. You're in luck. I was on my way to the--
Hey, I thought you were gonna watch the Blue Bloods marathon with me.
-Sorry, Grandma. Um, I-- -That's okay. I'll get started without ya.
-[indistinct chatter on TV] -Tommy Selleck waits for no one.
We better go. [chuckles]
Bye, guys.
-[horse snorts] -I'm getting the hang of this, huh?
[Cameron] Just takes time and practice, that's all.
Everyone's always in a hurry.
-Oh, and you aren't? -What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know. It seems like you can't wait to be done with high school.
Yeah, that's true. [chuckles]
I used to be like that too, but now that I lost my sponsorship,
I, um, don't even know if I'll be able to pay for college.
Man, that sucks.
I'm sorry, but it won't take much money for me to bum around.
See as much of the world as I can. Take as many pictures as I can.
That actually sounds amazing.
I would love to travel someday.
I always wanted to see Paris.
You mean, you wanna take pictures of yourself in Paris
so your followers know you went there?
Should I just do what you do and take rolls and rolls of pictures
Should I just do what you do and take rolls and rolls of pictures and never show anyone?
-Wait. -[horse snorting]
-How do you know-- -Brin told me.
You know, no one would have ever heard of Diane Arbus or Ansel Adams
if they hid in their dark room all day.
[giggles] What?
I can't believe you actually know those names.
So, how about it?
-How about what? -Your pictures.
-When do I get to see them? -Uh, I'm thinking never.
Oh, come on. You show me yours, and I'll show you mine.
Oh, everyone has seen yours.
Sorry, that came out way dirtier than I intended it to.
Uh, I'm just really private, that's all.
But, um… if you really wanna see what I do…
Yes.
Okay.
So you've really never been to Union Station?
Honestly, I didn't even know this was here.
Is that terrible?
Uh, yeah, kind of. [laughs]
It's like a classic, old-timey train station.
Well, it's actually a working train station
where people take trains. -[chuckles softly] -[laughs]
Then again, you don't strike me as the public-transportation type.
I carpool to school.
In your friend's Lexus.
Hey, Mr. Cahill.
-Hey, Cam. -This place is amazing.
I guess I never come downtown because it's always so crowded.
With street photography, crowds are the point. Makes it easier to blend in.
People don't mind you just taking their picture?
Uh, well, it depends.
Sometimes I ask permission, sometimes I don't.
But after a while, you kind of develop a sense of when it's okay to shoot.
-And when to run. -[chuckles]
-Thanks, Gene. Here you go. -Mm.
Gene's Nutella lattes are insane.
Wait, are you actually smiling?
What?
I don't know. I've just never seen you like this.
What do you mean?
Well, at school, you're this really reserved person,
but at the stables or here with your camera…
Oh, maybe it's because
no one in those places ever keyed the word "loser" into my truck door or put a fetal pig in my backpack.
into my truck door or put a fetal pig in my backpack.
Ouch.
Yeah.
It doesn't matter.
High school's a bunch of scared people pretending to be something they're not.
[chuckles] But this place?
This place is real.
Just like horses.
Best bullshit detectors in the entire animal kingdom.
So what about Gilly?
-Does he think I'm full of crap? -You think I'd be here with you if he did?
Sorry things are so bad for you at school.
Guess I'd be in a hurry to graduate too.
Yeah, I'm only doing it so my grandmother doesn't freak out.
Yeah, why do you and Brin live with her?
Sorry, if that's…
No, no, no. No, it's okay.
Well, you know our father lives in Sweden.
-His choice. -[Padgett] Mm-hmm.
And after our mom died and…
Oh, I am so sorry.
[Cameron] Yeah, it's four years ago. Plane crash.
She was dating this guy named Marcus, who flew a turboprop.
And one Saturday morning, they were on their way back from Laramie,
and, um…
You must miss her a lot.
Yeah, Mom was awesome.
In fact, she is the one who gave me this camera.
So that's why you love it so much.
Yeah. So what about your family?
Well, my parents are divorced.
-[chuckles] -Okay.
Um, my dad lives in Florida with his new family.
And I'm here with my mom.
-Okay, what does she do? -She's a nurse.
Hmm. [Padgett] I've never told anyone that before.
She works her ass off to give me every opportunity in the world.
And sometimes I'm scared I won't be able to make it up to her.
-[shutter clicks] -Hey, did I say you could do that?
No. That's the whole idea of a candid shot.
If you know I'm going to take a photo, then you gotta fix your hair,
and you do that whole duck-face thing.
-Yes. That's exactly it. -[phone pings]
-[phone keyboard clacking] -[phone pings]
[Cameron] Is… that an emergency?
Uh… sorry.
Uh, depends.
-Are you free next weekend? -Why?
It's my friend Alden's birthday, and she's having a theme party.
Okay, what's the theme?
It's Drop it like F. Scott. It's a Great Gatsby thing.
Yeah, she does realize those parties in the book
represent the shallowness of the ruling class, right?
Sadly, that is the appeal.
-Okay. -[Padgett] So what do you think?
-You down to get bougie together? -[Cameron] Yeah.
Can I bring some people?
Sure. Yeah. Bring whoever you want. [chuckles]
[Brin] Oh my God! Oh my God!
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I have the best brother ever.
He has his moments.
Okay. It's a roaring '20s theme,
so there's a million ways we can go with this.
Yeah, but we're only gonna try like, three, right?
[Nisha] Don't listen to him.
He's been wearing the same three plaids since 2017?
At least I alternate.
I get it.
You found a look that works, but like I tell my followers,
sometimes bold can be your bestie.
You actually say that? Out loud? To people?
Come on.
[Padgett] Okay, now don't tell me that wasn't fun.
It wasn't.
Okay, fine, it wasn't terrible.
But it's somewhere between getting my wisdom teeth out
and that Harry Styles show last year.
-Wait, you saw Harry Styles? -He took me for my birthday.
Aw, that's so sweet.
[Cameron] Okay. The point is,
we got our clothes, and we're done now, right?
Oh God, what now?
You're absolutely sure this is necessary?
Well, we want to complete the look, right?
-[snickers] Oh, definitely. -Out. Now.
-Fine. -[Padgett] Okay.
-Fine. -[Padgett] Okay. The most important thing for you to do now is trust me.
You've done this before?
Literally thousands of times.
Really? You shaved a guy's face?
-[buzzing] -Sorry, can't hear you.
I can't believe you got him to do this. He must really like you.
Uh, no, no. I'm just really persuasive.
-How's it going in there? -[Cameron] It's kind of hard to say.
Oh, come on. Just come out.
[Cameron] Okay.
Wow, you are good.
How do you feel?
Like I just lost Dancing with the Stars.
Well, if I didn't know any better,
and you weren't my brother,
I'd say you look pretty hot.
Right, Padgett?
Uh… yeah. Sure. [exhales]
[Nisha] Very subtle.
Wow.
Your camera? Really?
This is the only time I'm gonna be doing something like this.
-Might as well document it. -Hey, everybody. Padgett Head to Toe here.
Outside of Alden Pierce's 18th birthday party.
If you can't already tell, the theme is Drop It Like F. Scott.
I'm here with my amazing new friends.
Cameron.
-Brin. -Hi, guys.
And Nisha.
This is insane.
You're hot now. Get used to it.
Uh, no, I was talking about the party.
This one's teeny compared to her sweet 16.
We went to the beach.
In Turks and Caicos.
Can you believe this?
-[Alden] Padge! -Hey! Mwah, mwah.
Hi. I'm Alden.
Birthday girl.
Yeah, we've met.
Oh.
Oh!
I'm sorry, I gotta ask. What are you drinking?
Oh, it's my signature bday mocktail.
It's got cranberry juice, fresh raspberries, cherry Pop Rocks.
Hi, I just wanted to say happy birthday and thank you so much for inviting me.
[scoffs] I'm sorry. Who are you?
-Uh, Brin Kweller. -I thought I was in-- -Hey, uh…
We're gonna go get some drinks, and we'll see you guys in a bit.
Bye.
Padge, I don't know what you did to that Cameron guy, but damn!
What you did?
Oh, she means his costume.
And Cameron did that himself.
Wow, you might just win this bet after all.
Yeah, if you don't blow it for me first.
-Guess we'll see who's gonna be a loser. -We'll see.
So, Aniston just bailed on you, bro?
Yeah, bro.
I was on my way to pick her up, and she texted me and said it's over.
Said she's going to Brent Rivera's birthday party with that other dude.
That sucks, bro.
That Aniston chick was hot. If I were you, I'd be crying too.
That's okay. [sighs] My fans love my vulnerability.
-Wait, you guys aren't recording? -Oh!
-Shoot, my bad. -Oh my God.
Guys! All right, come on. I need another take.
[exhales] Okay. You got this.
[sighs] Damn, I lost it. Always be recording.
-My bad. That was my fault. -All right?
I still can't believe she'd ditch me for some rando loser who's only got 318,000 followers.
Well, he does play for the Clippers.
Yeah, that's pretty dope.
[Padgett] Don't tell me you're actually having fun.
Why would you say that?
This party is ridiculous.
[singing] You're having fun. You're having fun.
[Cameron] Maybe a little.
[Nisha] Hey.
Nice costume.
[scoffs] Didn't think I'd see another Jordan Baker.
Daisy is so overrated. [laughs]
Totally.
Wow. I look like the before picture for you.
Stop. You look great.
You were at my karaoke party.
Right. I was the one who didn't bring their swimsuit.
-Yeah. I'm sorry it turned weird. -It's okay. Weird's totally my thing.
Oh my God. [gags]
-They put them in the ice too? -[laughs]
Come on. I know where Alden keeps her non-Pop-Rock-aholic drinks.
-Thank you. -Let's go.
Hey, you.
Whoa, whoa. You're not even gonna say, "Hey"?
Blow me.
You're Aniston's problem now.
You're still mad about that? That was like, two weeks ago.
-Hey. -Dude! What the hell?
I'm sorry. I had something else to tell you.
-What? -[Jordan] I don't know.
That… I'm sorry.
And that she was right.
-Who? -[Jordan] Aniston.
She said that I wasn't over you, and… that's the truth.
and… that's the truth.
We belong together, Padge.
Now, come on. These nominations are on Monday, all right?
If we win prom king and queen, our followers would go crazy.
I don't care!
Oh, and by the way, there are no mean streets of Pali.
You live on the same block as Gwyneth Paltrow.
Oh man! You spilled my watermelon. It was the last one.
Now, all they have is mango.
I hate mango. It's a terrible flavor.
Hey.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I just, uh, spilled my drink.
But I was thinking about going to get another one, though.
Any chance you want to come with me?
[giggles] Sure.
Let's go.
Okay, enough pictures for you. No one's going to see them anyways.
I have a better idea. Come on.
Oh, photo booth? Seriously?
-Come on. I want to see your duck face. -Ugh.
Now show me what you got.
You're not supposed to look at me. -You're supposed to pose. -Sorry.
-You're supposed to pose. -Sorry. I guess I'm just mesmerized by watching you disfigure yourself.
So you're repulsed?
Totally, but it must be so hard to make yourself look terrible
when you're naturally so, you know…
What?
Beautiful.
[party DJ] All right, everyone, let's gather by the big cake
to sing Alden "Happy Birthday."
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
Stop it.
-♪ Happy birthday ♪ -[Jordan] Ow!
-♪ To you ♪ - [Brin] Get away from me, asshole!
-♪ Happy birthday… ♪ -Hey, Brin, what's going on?
Why are you making a big deal out of this?
-It was nothing. -You call that nothing?
-What happened? What did he do? -She's so overreacting.
-You, shut up. -He asked me if I wanted a drink.
-You, shut up. -He asked me if I wanted a drink. So I said, "Okay."
And then we went into this big room with a pool table.
-And we were just kissing. -See? No big deal.
But then he started going for more, so I bonked him with a pool ball.
-Which hurt, by the way. -Freaking piece of shit.
-Don't tell me she's your girlfriend? -No, she's my little sister, you idiot.
And if you ever touch her again--
What, you wanna go? You wanna go, man?
-Let's go. Let's get it. -Why'd you just take off your shirt?
I don't know. That's for me to know and for you to find out.
-What? -No, Cameron, come on.
[Padgett] He is not worth it.
No, not this time.
-[Padgett] Cameron, please. -[boy 1] Move back. Make some room.
[boy 2] You got it! You got it!
If you ever go near my sister again--
-What? -[all] Ooh!
[Jordan's friend] Haha. Okay, okay.
-Yes! -Oh!
Classic Johnny Wang move.
What the hell was that?
I'm sure that was me kicking your ass.
Cameron, enough!
-Back in there, bro. -Well, check out Captain Badass.
I dare you to try that again.
Yes! [cheers]
I wasn't ready for that!
-I need another take. Stop cheering! -Are you okay?
Cameron, that was amazing.
-Let's go get the truck. -[Brin] Okay.
-Let's go get the truck. -[Brin] Okay. -Okay? -Wait, you're not leaving, are you?
-Okay? -Wait, you're not leaving, are you?
Yeah, I think you should, but don't forget your camera.
No, no, no, no!
-Happy-- -Not now, Mom and Dad!
[Padgett] Cameron, are you okay? Let me help.
Cameron.
Cameron.
-Cameron, wait. -What do you want?
-Cameron, wait. -What do you want? To make sure you're okay. You were leaving.
An asshole hit on my sister and ruined my mother's camera.
What do you want me to do?
The way you stood up to Jordan back there, people were impressed.
Who? The-- the-- the valedictorian? The head cheerleader?
-The captain of the lacrosse team? -Cali doesn't have a lacrosse--
What am I doing here, Padgett?
I mean, why after four years did you suddenly start talking to me?
I… I don't know.
Maybe I just sensed there was more to you than what you let everyone see.
What if I like it that way?
Well, then that really breaks my heart.
Cameron, please.
[Alden] Broken heart, huh?
Looks like someone moved on from Jordan pretty quick.
I moved on from Jordan the second we walked into that trailer.
And now you're falling for our little project?
It's not like that.
I'm worried about him, okay? That's all. You saw what happened.
You mean, your plus-three freak parade who ruined my birthday?
Yeah, it was hard to miss.
Look, if you wanna welch on our bet now, I understand.
I mean, the guy's a bigger train wreck than we expected.
No.
We're still on.
Great party.
Thanks, but it's kind of been over for a while.
No party's over until I say it's over.
Come on, Cali High. Let's rock!
Oh.
-It is over. -Yeah.
Where's my shirt?
Who needs shirts?
Okay.
Hey, guys.
So the rest of tonight didn't go so great.
[Exhales] Well, it started out fun.
You know, I talk a lot here about self-improvement.
[Exhales] Your looks,
your attitude,
But I'm starting to think that who you choose to surround yourself with is so much more import--
that who you choose to surround yourself with is so much more import--
[girl] So awesome!
[boy] All right, bro!
-[all] Cameron! Cameron! Cameron! -[boy] Awesome, man!
That was so awesome.
Hey. I'm Celeste.
I wanted to say that while I reject the whole idea of the prom court as an antiquated, heteronormative construct,
of the prom court as an antiquated, heteronormative construct,
if I didn't, you'd have my vote.
Your vote for what?
[Nisha] Hey, Kweller. Dude.
Some Saturday night, huh? [chuckles]
Mr. Prom King nominee.
-What? -Did you not see?
-Cameroon Kewller for prom king. -[chuckles]
-That's ridiculous. -[laughs]
[Bosch] Attention Earthquakes, here are the prom court nominations.
For king, we have Jordan Van Draanen and Cameroon Kewller?
Tanya, is this a joke?
Okay. I am told that Cameroon is an actual student,
so congratulations to him
and to our third nominee, Sebastian Woo.
-Yes! Whoo! Yes! Whoo! -Oh my God, dude!
I'm the king of the school!
Sebastian Woo!
It is so fitting that they would butcher your name.
Could you imagine if you actually ran for prom king?
[muffled echo] Jordan Van D, baby!
Let's go!
Yeah, maybe I can.
[Alden] Sawyer.
Alden.
And Jordan?
What the hell is going on?
JVD out.

The only difference is, I didn't just hemorrhage 94,000 followers.

Don't act like you wouldn't have done the same thing.

-Alden. -[Alden] Yeah, that's right. We know you don't live at the Palisades Lofts.
How long have you known?
Mmm. I don't know, like a year, maybe? We didn't say anything.
Mmm. I don't know, like a year, maybe? We didn't say anything. We didn't wanna hurt your feelings. Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
We didn't wanna hurt your feelings. Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
Guess it's game on, Bubble Girl.

-I'm so sorry. -I'm so sorry.
I only lied because I thought if I told the truth,
you guys wouldn't like me anymore.
-I was embarrassed. -I don't care… at all. Okay?
I swear I had no idea she was planning this.
I don't get it. It's like she's suddenly this whole different person.
Is she though? Maybe we're just now seeing who she really is.
-What do you mean? -She quit the dance team.
-What do you mean? -She quit the dance team. Now she's starting her own squad with Jordan.
-Unbelievable. -[phone dings]
[Padgett] Wow. Look at you.
-Who is it? -[Quinn] Nothing.
-It's stupid. -[Padgett] Really?
-Then why are you blushing? -I'm not blushing. It's just a funny text.
-Mm. A stupid, funny text from… -Nisha.
-Q! That's amazing. -[Quinn chuckles]
I thought I saw you guys talking at the party.
Yeah, she's pretty great.
I was thinking about asking her to prom.
No way. Oh my God, that's so great. You guys would be so cute together.
-So how are you gonna ask her? -Hey, um…
You got a sec?
Go. I'll talk to you later.
I didn't think you were talking to me anymore.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I got really pissed off, but you didn't do anything.
There's something I wanted to talk to you about.
Hey! You, my man, are a rock star.
Inspiration. Do you want to hear a poem?
Sure.
Um, Cameron Kweller
Interstellar
Stood up to the dick
Made it stick
Cameron, one
Jordan, zero
King Cameron, you're my hero
Fight the power, man.
That was great.
-[crunches] -[painfully] Ah, worth it.
-Okay. [chuckles] -[chuckles]
Can you believe all this prom BS?
I know. Pretty cool, right? I mean, what do you think?
Well, that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.
Uh, but now I'm late for Art History.
Um, is there any chance you could come over after school?
-There's something I wanted to show you. -Um, sure.
-I'll be there. -Cool.
Bye.
-[door closes] -So this whole prom king thing,
I can't believe you're actually into it.
Well, I'm not really, but I do hate Van Draanen.
Guys like him crap all over everyone and somehow still end up on top.
Not this time. Not if I have anything to do with it.
-That sounded confident. -'Cause I am.
And after Alden's party, you have some serious traction.
But you're gonna have to let people see the real Cam Kweller.
Well, speaking of the real me, right this way.
Wow. I cannot believe you have your own darkroom.
Yeah. It was my 14th birthday present.
So you've been taking pictures your whole life then?
[Cameron] Kind of. Used to be more of a hobby,
but now I don't know.
Sometimes I feel like I could spend my entire life in this room.
Cameron, these are amazing.
So why are you letting me see them now?
Well, you wouldn't stop asking,
so I figured this was the only way to get you to stop.
Well, you are very talented.
I mean, look at this one. Oh!
Oh my God, I am so sorry.
It's, uh…
It's okay.
Really.
You know, you could totally make money at this, right?
You know I don't care about money.
Or not, but keeping your talent locked away.
What are you hiding from?
You know, I could ask you the same question.
What are you talking about?
Well, I'm talking about this.
And, uh… this.
And these.
Not the eyelashes, they're glued on pretty tight.
Listen, Cameron, there's something I need to tell you.
-And I need to tell you something too. -Okay?
Well, you asked me why I invited you here,
and I don't even let my own grandmother in here.
-Really? -Yeah.
Which is why she probably thinks I'm running a meth lab.
So then why am I here?
Because I trust you.
[Padgett] Oh, okay.
-Well, I-- -[Cameron] Are you okay?
Totally, I just… I need to go.
-Besides, I've wasted enough of your time. -I wouldn't put it that way.
No, that's not what I meant. I just… I have somewhere to be.
-Um… Call you later? -[Cameron] Yeah.
Sure.
Hey, you got a sec?
Uh, yeah. Why?
I just kind of wanted your advice on something.
If it isn't the fountain of truth
coming to get help figuring out the world of bullshit.
Yeah, funny.
Here's the deal. Uh…
Things with Padgett may have gotten a little more complicated than I thought.
Okay. Complicated good or complicated bad?
'Cause the other night at that party, I was definitely sensing chemistry.
Oh, wait.
Did you guys hook up?
Oh my God, you did!
No, no, no. We didn't hook up, we…
we kissed.
[shrieks] I knew it! Oh my God. This is huge. So did you ask her to prom?
It makes sense if you go together. And if you're king and queen?
How amazing would that be?
It would be like Cali's own royal love story.
-[chuckles] And you're the princess. -Whoa, whoa.
Yes. I thought about asking her,
but after we kissed, things just kind of got weird.
Of course they did. It's fine.
First kisses can be awkward.
First time having sex, that can be even weirder.
So is the last time
'cause you never know if it's gonna be your last.
Wait, you've never had sex.
Yeah, but I know things, though. Like this.
Yeah, but I know things, though. Like this. If you're worried about whether you should ask Padgett or not,
just ask yourself one question.
Okay, what's that?
Who kissed who first?
Actually, she kissed me first.
So I should ask her to prom, then.
Um, yeah, but you can't just ask, okay?
It's lame. You have to prompose.
What the hell is that?
-[Quinn] Hey. -Hey.
[Quinn] No word from Cameron?
No, he must think I'm such a freak. I practically sprinted out of there.
He had the nomination. Why'd screw it up by kissing him?
-[Quinn] I do have one theory. -Yeah?
You really like him, Padge, and when you like someone
You really like him, Padge, and when you like someone the other stuff just doesn't matter as much.
I do. I do like him.
Yeah.
Something tells me you might not have screwed up as much as you think.
-What do you mean? -[boy] Hey, look, look!
Oh my God, Cameron.
I know this isn't usually my style, obviously,
but, uh… what do you think?
-I think yes. -[Alden] Sorry.
I hate to interrupt this adorable moment, but don't you think there's something
I hate to interrupt this adorable moment, but don't you think there's something you should tell Cameron first?
-What are you doing? -[Quinn] Leave her alone, Alden.
-[Alden] Shut up, Quinn. -What's going on?
Padgett, do you want to tell him, or should I?
-What's she talking about? -What I was trying to tell you yesterday.
It's… It's actually funny.
After Jordan and I broke up,
I lost my sponsorships, my college money,
so I panicked.
-Yeah, she's not lying. Total meltdown. -Yeah, thanks to you, Alden.
So I made a bet with Alden
that I could take some person and… and… and make them over.
Some person. What kind of person?
-Can we talk about this in private? -No, what kind of person, Padgett?
The biggest loser so she could turn him into prom king.
-But that was before-- -Wait. So I was a bet?
-[Padgett] No-- -No, I was a fucking bet.
You can all go to hell.
Let's go.
Yikes, that was hard to watch.
Hey, it's Cameron. Leave a message, or don't.
Cameron, it's me again.
I know I covered this in the 800 texts you haven't returned,
but I'm so sorry,
but I'm so sorry, and I just want to make sure you're okay.
and I just want to make sure you're okay.
He's still not answering?
[Padgett] No, but can you blame him?
No, but right now, I'm a little bit more worried about you.
You and your god-awful ironing.
Please let me do that. Please.
You know, I convinced myself that I did my posts
You know, I convinced myself that I did my posts because I cared about my followers, but maybe I was just doing it for myself
because I cared about my followers, but maybe I was just doing it for myself
to get money and get popular.
Maybe I'm just a fraud.
Honey, I happen to know for a fact that you're not a fake.
You're a truly kind and caring person.
But I hurt someone, Mom. I mean, I really hurt him.
All right, yeah.
You screwed up, but it's only a mistake if you don't learn from it.
I just don't even know what to do anymore.
If I win tomorrow night, I'll have to go in front of all these people--
And be yourself.
But… what if I don't even like who that is anymore?
Listen, I know it feels like that right now.
I do. But the Padgett Sawyer that I know,
the kind, sweet, generous,
sure, stubborn girl that I've known for 18 years,
well, she gets lost now and again. We all do, but she always finds her way back.
We all do, but she always finds her way back.
Oh, Gilly.
I thought you were a good judge of character. [sniffs]
All right.
-How do I look? -Gorge.
You're gonna be the queen of the chaperones.
Thank you. It looks like my car is here. All right, put your dress on.
Thank you. It looks like my car is here. All right, put your dress on. I'll see you there.
Okay.
-You're really gonna go through with this? -I mean…
-You're really gonna go through with this? -I mean… I know I'm not gonna get what I want,
so at least this way, I have a chance to make things right with Cameron.
-Ha! Wanna bet? -Too soon.
Nisha, I know you don't trust me.
I mean, he's your best friend,
but I think I've really fallen for him, so I have to try.
You have one big problem. There's no way that dude is going to prom.
Yeah.
So I guess that means there's only one person left to ask.
Screw off, Bubble Girl.
Okay, a little harsh,
but I have to ask.
Is he okay?
I don't know. He's at work.
Why do you keep calling me? Aren't you supposed to be at prom?
Yeah, like half an hour ago.
But I have a really important favor to ask.
Tell me why in the hell I should help you.
I can't, and I know you two have lost so much more than me,
but I've lost a lot recently.
I lost my self-respect.
I lost my college fund.
I lost my friends,
but the only thing I truly care about losing…
is your brother.
[Bosch] Tonight's the big night.
Turns out this year's dance presentation is now gonna be a dance competition.
I don't know what that means, but it's the committee's decision,
I don't know what that means, but it's the committee's decision, and I support them.
Hey.
What's in the bag?
Formal wear, or the closest thing I could find to it in your closet.
Dude, it's a disaster in there.
Why are there so many Skittles on the floor?
Because I spilled some Skittles. Look, if that's for prom, I--
Look, I know what you're gonna say, okay, and… I get it.
Padgett screwed up.
What she did was mean and selfish and wrong.
Yes, exactly. So why are you here?
Because, Cam…
I've… I've missed you.
Brin, I'm right here.
No, no. I mean, like…
I miss the way you used to be, you know? Before…
Before Mom.
[sniffs] Ever since you've been with Padgett, okay,
you've been back, and you've been smiling again, and you've been happy.
And I just feel like… [sniffs] …for the first time since we moved here
that I have my brother back.
And don't lose her, Cam.
We lost mom, and there's nothing we could have done about that,
but now you have a choice, so just… just don't lose her, okay?
There you are, thank God. We need you to start the dance.
-Big night, huh? -What do you want, Alden?
Nothing, I just noticed you didn't bring Cameron.
-So-- -He's not coming. Okay?
You win the bet.
And when are you gonna become a permanent loser?
I'll get it done as soon as I can. Happy?
I'll be happy when I get my crown.
And, oh, hope you like the new choreography me and Jordan came up with.
[Bosch] Cali High Earthquakes, it's time to report to the stage for your annual dance…
-Come on. This is it. Let's go. -[Alden] Jordan, it's time.
Come on, guys. If you put your TikToks down,
you'll see some people dancing in real life.
It's gonna be great.
[sighs, speaking to self] We have some weird-ass traditions at this school.
Hey, excuse me. Sorry. Hi.
We hired a DJ for this thing. They said he was over here somewhere.
-Oh actually, that's… that's me. -You're the DJ?
-Oh actually, that's… that's me. -You're the DJ? Great. Um, where's your stuff?
-My stuff? -Yeah, your equipment.
Your… your turntables,
your jog wheel, crossfader? Your… your Traktor scratch?
Dude, I have no idea what any of that stuff is.
Are you telling me we paid you $4,500 for your phone?
Yeah. Kinda. [scoffs]
You know that's more than I make in a month?
Well… I know that now.
Hey, so no sign of Cameron?
No, and if he doesn't get here soon, it's gonna be too late.
It already is. Principal Bosch's about to announce the court.
-You sure you still wanna do this? -Yes.
If I win, I need you to live stream on your phone, and then go on this app
If I win, I need you to live stream on your phone, and then go on this app on my phone and press the red button.
on my phone and press the red button.
-I mean, how can I do both? -Just give me the phone.
[Bosch tapping mic] Hello, hi, hey. One, two, three, eyes to me.
Come on, bring it in. It's the big moment.
I know this is live streaming, but if you put your phones down,
it's actually happening right here in front of you.
Look, I know this means a lot to some of you, so let's get through it
Look, I know this means a lot to some of you, so let's get through it so we can be done.
All right, your 2021 Cali High Prom King is
Jordan Van Draanen.
[Bosch] Congratulations to Jordan.
So humble, isn't he?
Just wanna slap his face. [chuckles]
I'm kidding. I would never slap a student, not until after they graduate.
But he's not going to graduate, so it's fine.
Okay. -Here you go, big guy. So proud. -[chuckles]
-Here you go, big guy. So proud. -[chuckles]
Enjoy your moment of glory.
[boy] Not my favorite.
It's Jordan Van Draanen, baby.
Is that it?
Yeah, bro.
Of course, it is.
No, I just want the microphone.
-Oh, okay. -Yeah. Okay, all right, yes!
Well, that was fun.
Moving right along. Your 2021 Prom Queen,
the woman voted to a forcible dance with the guy behind me.
No, no, no, no, no. Keep it on. Keep it all on.
We have all seen plenty of your nipples.
All right, your 2021 Prom Queen,
in the closest vote we've had in a very long time,
Padgett Sawyer.
[girl] Yeah, Padgett!
Congratulations.
-Thank you! -Really beautiful.
[boy] That's right, Padge!
[Padgett] This is me.
And this is also me.
And this is me too.
-Hey. -[audience laughs]
But I'm gonna let you guys in on a little secret. It's all fake.
Because the truth is, this is the real me.
[Padgett] And so is this.
Let's not forget about this one.
Bubble Girl!
Yep, that is snot coming out of my nose.
But here's the thing.
For the last four years,
I've been so busy selling myself on social media,
putting out this image of who I wanted people to think I am,
this perfect person
with perfect makeup,
perfect clothes,
perfect grades,
the perfect boyfriend.
And trust me.
Nothing could've been further from the truth.
I even lied about where I live.
We all do it…
in our own way
like someone special once told me.
He said high school is just a bunch of scared people
He said high school is just a bunch of scared people pretending to be something they're not,
and that can be true.
Especially when we're at our worst.
But it doesn't have to be that way.
That's the lesson he taught me.
I only wish I didn't have to lose him to learn it.
Are you sure?
Second place, coming through, make some room.
Second place, I'll take it. I mean, if she doesn't want it, I'll take it.
Excuse me, Ms. Pierce, you… you actually came in fourth.
No, I demand a recount.
No need. You actually lost by a lot.
Please leave the stage. [boy 1] Ow! [boy 2] Down!
-[boy 3] Burn! -Thank you. All right!
So the runner-up and your 2021 Prom Queen
is a write-in candidate.
Her name is Celeste Straczynski.
Is there a Celeste Straczynski here?
[softly] Your hat.
-[clears throat] -All right, let's do this.
-Ow! -Suck it!
DJ, hit it!
-[Quinn] Padgett. -All right.
I'm gonna take off.
Wait, your phone.
-Where are you going? -[Padgett] Home.
Come on, stay with us.
-I officially forgive you. -[Padgett chuckles]
No, I'm done here,
but you guys have fun, though.
Well, I'm still here, and why do I know this song?
I'm still here, and why do I know this song?
-[text pings] -♪ Beside the green, green grass ♪
♪ Swing, swing ♪
♪ Swing the spinning step ♪ -♪ You wear those shoes ♪ -[horse neighs]
Whoa.
Hey.
Cameron. I… How…
I may have had a little help.
I would've rode him all the way, but I would've gotten arrested on the 405.
I meant what I said.
I'm gonna start being honest about who I am from now on,
I swear.
Okay, well, if we're being honest, there is one thing in your speech
Okay, well, if we're being honest, there is one thing in your speech you got wrong.
What was it?
You never really lost me.
Seriously?
-I'm done with her. -Thank you.
Now where were we?
[Brin] Yes! Whoo-hoo! Finally!
[boy] Check it out!
[Padgett] Good morning, guys.
Guess where we are?
Portugal! [chuckles]
Hard to believe we're already six days into our trip.
Say hi, Cameron.
I just wanna say thank you to all my followers who came back to me,
who are so supportive of my new direction here.
I hope you guys keep following us this summer because Cameron has promised
I hope you guys keep following us this summer because Cameron has promised to help me post photos every day along the way.
So stay safe, be yourself,
and I'll see you guys soon.

-…sister again. -Hm.
Goddamnit, I flinched.
Get it!
Working. It's working great.
All I'd been told was that Forte dei Marmi was an elegant seaside resort.
In fact,
it was like stepping into a postcard,
where everything seemed staged.
The blue and white cabanas of the private beaches.
The raked sand.
The sound of laughter carried by the breeze.
And I was struck by a sense of timelessness...
Bicycles drifting silently along the promenade at sunset.
A perfect place for a summer vacation, a refuge.
But even in Forte dei Marmi,
the days grow shorter and the nights longer.
The Apuane Alps,
exchange their white marbled peaks
for a cloak of frozen snow.
Darkness devours the light
and fear finds us.
Even in Forte dei Marmi,
we have learned to lock our doors.
This sunny, serene little town
now appears empty.
As if it were... evacuated.
This is a winter story.
Help!
Help!
Help!
What's wrong?
It's the Clementis. They're saying they'll only talk to you. From Barbados.
Have they really got nothing better to do?
Something on their gate camera freaked them out.
I was hoping to get a few hours sleep tonight.
You said if it was a Premium Client... I should call you.
You did the right thing. Good night, Emma.
You did the right thing. Good night, Emma. - Sleep. - I'll try.
- Sleep. - I'll try.
Mr. Clementi.
- Are you at the house? - Yes. I'm here.
And? Is everything alright?
The perimeter cameras are all clear.
- Yeah, but... - No sign of any forced entry.
Look, it was really distressing, the girl's face.
It just made us wonder who else might be lurking around...
It's like an invasion these days, you can't be too sure, you know?
Not everything is immigrants.
- Please, check everything yourself. - Alright, I'll check.
Thank you, Mr. Santini.
OK. A good day to you.
Actually, it's the middle of the night here.
But thank you.
- Goodbye, Santini. - Goodbye.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
What the fuck's he doing!
- Good evening, Mr. Santini. - Yeah,
I've got a likely drunk driver on Via Volta and Via Carrara.
License plate PI55388.
We'll send someone right away.
Thank you... Thank you.
Never mind.
You sure?
Yeah, yeah, good night.
- What's your problem, asshole? - Dario...
Do I know you?
I know your mother.
Come on, get in, you can't drive like that. I'll take you home. Come on.
- Easy! Easy! - Shit.
Just tell me what happened.
I'll deal with you later.
No, you won't.
He was driving drunk. He's lucky I found him.
I worry that it's more than alcohol.
So what were you up to?
Some billionaire lost his cat?
The car's on Via Volta.
Thank you, Roberto.
- Good night. - Yes...
It's good to see you.
Dario? Dario, open up!
Dario, open up!
Good morning.
Who are you trying to kid?
Even Angela knows you weren't here last night. She got home at three in the morning!
She got home at three in the morning!
Whatever happened to house rules?
I'm just curious...
Your clients, the anthropologists,
do they know you're sleeping in their house when you're not sleeping?
They're in South Africa, they don't get back for a while.
Where was she?
Ask her yourself.
Why don't you track her?
I'm not installing that shit on her phone.
- Let her have her own life. - Sure!
Listen, you're on the front page this morning with Pilati.
PILATI BACKS CLAUDIA RAFFAELLI. Fantastic! I'd forgotten.
You pleased? Good morning.
And good morning to you, too, Miss.
We are fine, thank you for asking.
You got something to say...?
Angela, you broke curfew. How many times have I told you that you can't be late on a school night?
How many times have I told you that you can't be late on a school night?
I already told Mom.
I was doing homework with Ginevra. We fell asleep.
Anyway, where were you?
I'm late. Gotta go.
No texting on your bike! - I know, you always tell me. - Your mother made front page news...
- I know, you always tell me. - Your mother made front page news...
Angela, did you see Mom on the front page?
She didn't hear me...
And if she had...? Do you think she cares?
Here comes somebody who does care.
Crap. Matteo. He's early.
This is not a good look for us.
Just take the damn sleeping tablets. I feel like I'm married to a vampire.
The tablets made me feel crazy.
- And this is a better crazy? - Good morning.
- Matteo! - Well done on the front page.
- Thanks! Great, wasn't it! - Yes, I saw it.
Here's the new cut.
You're going to love it. VERSION 5 FOR A SAFER TOWN
New music.
Sea...yes.
Perfect!
The whole panorama...
- With the Forte. - This is the painful part.
- I'm tense. - That's not true!
In a world under threat, a vote for me is a vote for a safer future!
You look great.
The Pilati fundraiser...
- our head count now includes... - Who's that?
Marcello... Ferrario.
- Ferrario the billionaire? - Yup.
This is gigantic, fantastic stuff.
I know. Ferrario's personal security team already left a message.
Is this something for Mr. Santini?
- No. I'm handling it. - Good.
- No. I'm handling it. - Good. Let's go!
Let's go!
- Good morning. - Good morning.
Still here?
I need to show you something.
What?
Last night's recording on the Clementi camera.
Fuck!
- What clients have we further east? - Do they have 'history function'?
Yes. Everybody has 'history function' on their perimeter cameras
whether they pay for it or not.
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
What's with the coat? You cold?
I hate winter, I hate it!
- Damn, we're good. - The best.
Look... look.
There.
- Who are they arresting? - I don't know.
Fuck.
What is it?
That's Walter and his daughter, Maria.
Spezi.
He was my technician.
The best in the business.
Who's that doing the recording?

OK! Before bestowing upon you my pearls of wisdom...
I've got some bad news for you.
Maria Spezi, your classmate, is in hospital.
Oh, God. What happened?
She tripped on one of her father's empty bottles.
Guys, please!
Anyway, Maria is OK, nothing serious! And now please let's get to work.

Excuse me, Angela? Any other noises you want to make?
I'm sorry. I mean...
does anybody else think that the narrator's point of view lacks... empathy?
Sir, this is my trauma.
There's no way I'm going to take this kind of abuse.
No, you're right.
You're not. Ginevra, continue.
"We couldn't get away with it all the time..."
- Hey, Enzo. - Security Man!
- Everything OK? - Fine, you? Fine! Listen...
- The guy filming, who is he? - Domenichetti.
Come on, the case is closed.
He's guilty, he admitted it... look at the file.
Spezi's neighbor, Rizieri,
reported Spezi being drunk right before the incident.
He feared for the daughter's safety.
Said there'd been a pretty big row between them earlier in the evening.
"It's a steep climb, you know, back to normal."
Climb?
Some people can't make it.
Maria...
On a scale of one to ten how bad is the pain?
Eleven.
Let's start very slowly.
Can you move your fingers? Like so.
Good girl, the other way?
I need to check the range of motion in your shoulder.
Give your whole arm over to me. Trust me with it.
Let's try again! Let go...
Right, Maria...
Your arm was dislocated.
If you carry on like this, you risk your shoulder becoming frozen!
The more you do now, the better your future.
Go on... eat the forbidden fruit.
- Already did. - Again.
Sweetheart, you need to find someone your own age.
You're... insatiable.
Insatiable!
Don't you dare compare me to Ginevra.
What we have is real.
I need to work.
What's wrong?
Sunday evening you came home really late
and didn't let me stay. Why?
You're sounding like my ex-wife who's 'ex' for a reason, by the way.
You know I don't want to bother you.
There's something you're not telling me. I just want to know, to help...
Listen...
The delivery date for the book the pressure, it's driving me crazy.
I've just got to finish it. And I can't if you stay.
Just give me a week and then I'll be all yours.
But now, go, please.
You still haven't answered my question. Where were you on Sunday?
- I was driving around. - Doing what?
Looking for something.
- For what? - I don't know. Something. My muse!
Well, that bitch, Ginevra, just posted a photo of you.
Any good?
Very cool. In the school courtyard.
They'd all die if they knew.
They must never know, Angela.
Never ever!
You're hurting me...
What's up?
I'm synching the audio from Domenichetti's cell.
It's my fault!
It's my fault!
You know, as tragic as all this Spezi business is...
The timing couldn't be better for you, could it?
That's a low blow...
You look great, by the way.
- Really? - Yeah.
Is that for the event or for Pilati?
If I weren't married, I might be attracted to him.
No, no. You are married, and you're still attracted to him.
I get it!
He's the opposite of me. He's all the things I'll never be. Rich. Elegant.
He's all the things I'll never be. Rich. Elegant.
Rich...
Maybe in another universe...
Here we are!
Try and look happy tonight, Roberto.
And for God's sake don't shake Pilati's hand.
What's all that about? The whole 'not touching' thing?
I guess if you're that rich, you can afford to have any phobia you want.
Still, kind of a relationship deal-breaker, don't you think?
Not necessarily.
- Boss... - Good evening, Santini.
- Good evening, Claudia. - Good evening.
Looking sharp tonight, Carlo.
- Good evening. - Good evening.
- Curzio... - Claudia...
Impressive turnout.
Some pretty deep pockets in this room.
- Thanks to you. - Thanks to you.
Roberto, look at your wife, this evening, in this light, a Medici Venus...
a Medici Venus...
Feminine on the outside, firm as marble on the inside. You are a lucky man, Roberto.
firm as marble on the inside. You are a lucky man, Roberto.
I've always thought so, yes.
- Speeches in five. - Of course.
Billionaire-Ferrario is already here.
Matteo. Please. Just 'Ferrario is already here'.
- I'll have a whisky. - Roberto!
May I introduce you to my new American client, Camille.
She just bought on Via Gorizia.
Just in time, if the rumors are true.
- What rumors this time? - Once Marcello Ferrario buys,
we're looking at a 20% house price bump.
You know Ferrario's not supposed to be here tonight, right?
No cameras allowed.
God forbid a high profile 'Liberal' should be seen to be supporting
a 'Conservative' candidate...
Are we boring you?
Yes.
No, I'm kidding.
Sorry. I'm dealing with horrendous insomnia.
Oh, you poor thing, are you taking anything?
Because if you're not careful, you can start hallucinating.
Yes, I know.
Well, for starters, no alcohol.
Everybody! Your attention, please!
I know that for many of you Forte dei Marmi
is a second home. Or third. Or fourth.
But it's a place
we all cherish.
And let nobody tell us we haven't earned it.
Ladies and gentleman,
I give you our next mayor, our first woman mayor,
our first woman mayor,
and, I guarantee, our best mayor ever!
Claudia Raffaelli. For a safer Forte dei Marmi!
Thank you.
I was born in Forte dei Marmi.
I grew up here.
My daughter grew up here.
And I intend on growing old here.
As a child, I wandered free.
Every street was safe.
Every front door was unlocked. No-one had any reason to be afraid.
Imagine.
There's a reason why we call them 'invaders'...
'undesirables'.
And let us not forget
how much we owe to our Chief of Police, Mori,
for solving the recent spate of burglaries, now finally under control.
You know,
this dramatic incident
that just occurred
in the early hours of Sunday morning,
involving that poor girl,
is a case in point.
She was attacked... by someone she trusted.
You're not coming in?
You don't need me prowling around all night.
Everybody fell in love with you tonight.
Claudia. What's wrong?
The bitch changed her story.
She's saying it happened at Pilati's.
What?
Don't worry. Pilati wasn't there. He was in Milan. The house was empty.
But that's not the point. It's the optics.
You have to fix this, Roberto.
As soon as possible, understand?
Alright.
Is that too tight?
Let me loosen it a little...
Show me your hand... there.
Roberto, please tell your wife to calm down.
The girl is obviously protecting her father.
The anaesthetic wore off, she realized he was locked up,
The anaesthetic wore off, she realized he was locked up, she panicked.
Now she's claiming it happened at Pilati's place,
that there was a lot of drinking and some boy.
A boy?
A boy whose name she conveniently forgot. It's bullshit.
An obvious fabrication.
Look, Spezi's been here before,
drunk and disorderly, resisting arrest.
He confessed at the scene of the crime, let's not forget that.
- Any drugs involved? - Nothing in toxicology,
beyond the painkiller the hospital gave her.
- So where's Spezi? - We're releasing him.
I know. What can I do? She refuses to press charges.
Don't worry, we're sending her home with a social worker.
- Sorry. Alessandro, can you take over? - Sure.
I just lost a bet with myself.
What do you mean?
I was sure you would take another seven years to call me.
Did you pick up Dario's car?
Yes!
I need to talk to him. Where does he work?
If my son has done something terrible, you'd tell me, right? Yes, I would tell you.
He works at Gilda's Beach. The restaurant.
Alright. Then maybe... - we'll meet again. Bye. - OK.
- we'll meet again. Bye. - OK.
Dario? He stopped showing up about six weeks ago.
Did he say why?
We're getting on fine without him.
Thanks.
If you find that dickhead Dario, tell him to call me, Letizia.
So I can ignore him.
Maria, tell me where you sleep.
Upstairs.
And, Mr. Spezi, where do you sleep?
Down here.
And are you in regular employment, enough to meet your needs?
Yes.
You sure you're alright?
Why does everybody keep asking me that?
I'm fine here.
Alright.
I'm leaving now.
This is for her pain.
Please make sure she takes it as prescribed.
Goodbye, Maria.
Maria, I'm sorry, if you want we can talk about what happened.
I don't want to talk about it.
Don't worry. I told them it wasn't you.
Maria... listen... Maria...
I'm going to clear my name of everything, you'll see.
They can't keep treating us like this!
They can't keep treating us like this.
You fell asleep.
I can help you.
- Mr. Santini? Everything OK here? - He fell asleep.
Light's green, sir. You get to where you need to be.
Roberto. The sleeplessness...
Roberto. The sleeplessness... The night. The dark. It's a new perspective.
- Embrace it. - Fuck off, witch!
It's the one rotten tooth in the smile that is Forte dei Marmi.
You have no idea how long I've waited for this moment.
I love it.
Wonderful!
- Can we go inside? - Sure.
For the outside, discreet perimeter cameras, all thermal.
so no light pollution, motion-activated, obviously.
All with facial recognition and discernment
be it friends, relatives,
or 'undesirables'.
Basically, the answer to all your questions is 'yes'.
Today everything's possible.
Look, nobody was raped. Nobody died.
No bones were broken. All hymens remained intact.
It was a domestic dispute. Nothing more.
You're in the right business, Mr. Santini.
Eh, yes, my dear Marcello.
We're targets, men like us. The world has changed.
We can no longer afford
to be seduced by the needy.
Marcello, I don't want a fortress,
- I love how central the villa is. - Yeah, there's everything here.
She just wants to be within walking distance of Prada and Gucci.
Shall we go?
Read me some of your book.
Not ready.
This time, I want us to come together. At the exact same moment.
I don't want to come until you do.
For fuck's sake, Angela...
You don't seem to want me as much as you did...
I thought it might help...
What the fuck are you going on about, Angela,
I'm 40 not 70!
And you really think that's the problem.
You really think a blue pill is going to solve everything?
Jesus Christ, Angela, you really are a little girl.
- It's such a shame. - What?
That these are the people you need for your campaign.
- Come on, it's all part of the game. - Game?
Yes.
'All hymens remained intact'? Beautiful!
- How the fuck is it possible? - What?
To not give a fuck what happened to Maria.
It was a joke.
- A joke? - Yes, a joke!
That girl is scarred for life!
I just can't help wondering how we'd feel if Angela had been the victim.
But she wasn't. And I'm trying to make sure she never will be.
But she wasn't. And I'm trying to make sure she never will be. - Not her, not any other girl! - Yeah, yeah...
- Not her, not any other girl! - Yeah, yeah... Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, yeah...
Roberto, I have to ask you. Are you seeing Elena again?
No!
No... so these...
- Then what are these blue pills? - They're not mine.
- They're not yours? - They're not mine.
Yes, they are. Masculus V.
Claudia, I'm 40, not 70! - I don't need them. - Sure! You're too much of a stud.
- I don't need them. - Sure! You're too much of a stud.
- Where did you find them? - At home, where did I find them?
Have a look, there'll be a receipt or a bill...
- Let me check my bag... - It'll be an online order.
There. Found it!
You hoped I wouldn't find it, but...
they're Angela's.
What does she need them for?
I mean, is that even legal? She's a minor. Who gave them to her?
Who the hell is she sleeping with?
She's going to bed with some old guy.
This family's falling apart.
Nobody deals with anything!
We're like lodgers who happen to be sharing the same house...
and nothing more.
You're mad...
I thought he was, like, in jail.
Only the hottest fashions in Forte dei Marmi.
Oh, God, guys...
He's coming this way.
Hopefully not. Oh, my God!
Hey, what are you doing? Little Chiara! Your face hasn't changed!
Little Chiara! Your face hasn't changed!
Well? And you?
Maria's birthday parties. That's it. Remember?
Maria's birthday parties. That's it. Remember? My wife's 'torta paradiso'.
You ate a bit too much of them...
What happened to us all?
I don't know... dunno!
Anyway...
No... no!
That's the September case. It goes after the April arrest.
September is when they tazered me.
I was minding my own business in the park.
The police are being pressured to make more arrests.
"A Safer Future"?!
Not for the likes of me. I'm just another statistic. Everybody knows.
255 LIKES. ONLY THE HOTTEST FASHIONS IN FORTE DEI MARMI.
- Did you see this? - What?
A message from Angela. "Urgent family meeting 3pm tomorrow."
"No excuses." What's she up to?
We'll find out tomorrow.
No excuses...
The good news is that of the five families who own Villa Casamora,
four have agreed.
One brother is still holding out.
- Holding out for what? - He wants more than a fifth.
Good for him. Is he bluffing?
- Honestly, yes. - Don't mind me.
Now we'll continue with the subject of the contract...
- It's me... - Hello.
So. Are we an unfinished conversation?
Yes...
Look,
if you can think of a place, I can buy us the time.
- When? - Tonight?
I mean, I'm pretty sure I can sort out a babysitter.
Wait. You don't expect me to look after Federico, do you?
Of course not... It would be inhuman of me to ask such a thing of you.
He's going to Hugo's house.
And why didn't you tell me you'd quit your job?
I hate my life. You okay for tonight?
OK... I'll text you. Bye.
I'll text you. Bye.
Who was that?
Emma.
She wants to swap nights for days.
- I brought you a coffee. - Thank you.
Fuck.
"Conditions of sale:
The sale takes place under the following terms and conditions..."
I'll explain later...
"The real estate under discussion,
are and will be until the date of the definitive contract of sale..."
Because I have to tell you something...
"... deeds, free of mortgage restrictions".
- It's that... - No! Don't touch him!
Don't touch him!
You cannot touch him! Is that clear?
- I didn't want to... - I'm sorry.
Any touching... It's like handling dead flesh.
Curzio, I'm sorry, I'm mortified.
Unbelievable!
- I'm finished, I'm going. - Yes.
- Goodbye. - I'm sorry.
Dario, you idiot.
And here we have Maria.
Well done, cheers!
Well done, Pilati.
ERASED REFORMATTED
ERASED REFORMATTED
Emma! Why would random internal cameras be reformatted at Pilati's?
Oh, that must have been Ferrario's team.
Ferrario's team? Who authorized this?
Your wife.
But history on the perimeter cameras is stored on the Cloud.
She gave them full access.
They needed to remove any evidence that Ferrario was there.
Full access.
That fucking fundraiser.
The studio recordings have vanished as well. Why?
Because Ferrario was in here! Because we were all in here!
That's why it's not there.
I'm sorry. Claudia said not to bother you with it.
Don't worry, I'm sorry.
Well done, Claudia.
Brilliant, Claudia.
I hate Hugo. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do.
- No, you don't. - Yes, I do.
- How's it going? - Fine.
- Thank you! I owe you! - Don't worry.
Be good. I love you.
What is it?
He's nocturnal. Like you.
- He's my conscience. - Not tonight he's not.
Any hidden cameras, Mr. Santini?
Anyone else watching us?
Can thermal cameras detect sexual arousal?
Definitely.
It's OK, Freddie, it's OK. I'm coming now. I'm literally getting in my car.
Alright?
Elena!
Elena!
- What is it? What's wrong? - Federico just called me in a panic.
He never wanted to spend the night at Hugo's. I made him.
What kind of mother am I?
Do you see why I can't do this with you? It's like I lose my mind.
I'm sorry, I thought I could, but this is wrong. I'm running out of time to make mistakes.
Mistake? That's what this is now?
You're the one who said we were unfinished.
And thank God you did.
You know, when...
when we split up, I made a promise. I promised to myself
that if I couldn't have you, I wouldn't have anything else.
And that's exactly that I got! Nothing!
I never allowed anyone else to make me feel how I felt with you... alive!
And it's made me... featureless, like a man with no face...
Look at the baggage I come with.
One son who hates me and another who can't survive without me.
- Let me speak to Dario. - No, you don't. I'll handle it.
He was there at Pilati's the night of the assault.
Why are you telling me this now?
After you've slept with me? Jesus!
Here we are again.
I'm telling you because it might be him!
I need to talk to him before anyone else does.
There's no good reason to let this go any further.
He's upstairs. You're not doing this without me.
Sunday night. I pulled you over.
You were drunk. Where had you been?
Sunday?
Drinking with a friend. At a bar in Sarzana. What do you care?
Drinking with a friend. At a bar in Sarzana. What do you care? I care because it's not true.
You were at the home of Curzio Pilati.
Or is that not true?
That's true... Sunday, yes.
I worked for the guy, OK?
Mostly nights. Odd jobs.
Running errands. Caretaker stuff.
Dario, I love you,
Dario, I love you, but what sane person would hire you to take care of anything?
And this is why I don't tell my mother what the fuck I'm up to.
How did you meet Pilati?
- Is this an interrogation? - Yes.
At Gilda's Beach. He's there for lunch all the time.
Listen Roberto,
he was paying me three times as much and it beats raking sand.
So talk to me about the security camera.
- The security camera... - The one you ripped out of the wall.
OK, I get it now. You're bangin' my mother,
so now you get to play Dad with me? Well, it doesn't work that way!
I broke the camera because he fired me. For no reason.
- The guy's a weirdo. - And Maria Spezi?
- The guy's a weirdo. - And Maria Spezi? Why was she there?
Well?
Pilati and some other guy found her wandering around the streets.
- What other guy? - I don't know. Some guy.
She was trying to get into the church on Via Trento. - She was sobbing. They picked her up. - Whose car?
- She was sobbing. They picked her up. - Whose car?
- Pilati's. The Porsche. - And she just got into the car.
No, obviously not.
She knew the other guy and he knew her.
Look, she was really upset about something.
We all got hammered, especially the girl.
So we made her coffee...
- A coffee? - Yes, a coffee.
- It's true. - Right? See?
We tried to sober her up. Then I got out of there.
I swear.
Listen, I'm sorry that girl got hurt,
but whatever happened to her, I don't know anything about it.
The church on Via Trento.
One step at a time...
Easy, easy.
WHERE ARE YOU? WE HAVE A FAMILY MEETING Fuck! Fuck!
- Where are you going? - I forgot something. See you.
You're late. I wrote to you. Do you not read your cell?
There was traffic.
So, yeah,
my essay is called 'Bone of Contention'.
Mom, I know you're going to hate this,
but it's time for some family truths about what happened.
What actually happened, you know, when I was seven.
OK.
I mean, why is it such a 'Bone of Contention' between you guys?
Why won't you ever talk about it?
- Angela, because... - Because it was so horrible!
The worst day of my life.
I lost you for ten minutes at the park.
Ten terrible minutes...
ten minutes of agony.
We found you behind the carousel.
That vile creature, Walter Spezi, was assaulting you.
His penis was out. His pants were covered with semen.
Come on, Claudia...
Your father tackled him.
- There. Are you happy now? - Why can't I remember it?
Because you were traumatized.
The mind protects itself. It needs to forget.
All I remember is a weird doctor showing me dolls.
That was a psychiatrist. He helped you heal.
But... why wasn't Spezi convicted?
You may well ask. You may well ask.
But I'm going to make sure it doesn't happen twice.
And this time...
- he'll pay for it. - Mom! And off she goes...
Angela, my love. You just can't go there with your mother. Let it go.
Great.
Really helpful, Dad...
I can tell you this... it wasn't semen, but urine. Just so you know.
On the subject of family truths... who are the blue pills for?
Claudia...
I fired Spezi for you. But it was never enough, was it?
No, it wasn't enough!
If you're going to investigate anything, you should be investigating your own daughter
you should be investigating your own daughter and her mysterious life.
- Maybe I don't want to know. - Sure, that's obvious.
How many times did I promise you... that I'd never do it?
I promised so often!
Let's try with your date of birth.
Right, your date of birth back to front.
What could you have used, street number...
Please don't tell me you're so stupid to just choose...
A CODE HAS BEEN SENT TO YOUR TRUSTED DEVICE Angela. Have I taught you nothing? Five, eight,
Angela. Have I taught you nothing? Five, eight, three, zero, two, four.
three, zero, two, four.
ANGELA S. TELEPHONE
Where do you go to every day?
Monday...
house and school.
Tuesday...
What's this place?
What is this 'Bakery'?
Where did you go?
Keep calm.
"Love! Love, love, love!"
Who the fuck is this, Angela?
Who is it? Who the fuck is it?
MEMORIES
"Vacations, friends."
No, no, no.
How's the writing going?
Well... "I'm trying to discern the truth from a fog of conflicting memories".
"I'm trying to discern the truth from a fog of conflicting memories".
How did you know I was here?
I don't believe it! You spied on me!
- You said you'd never do that. - Who's the scumbag?
- Why were you in Milan with him? - He's not a scumbag.
He's my professor.
We were in Milan because he had a big meeting with his agent.
He'd a big meeting? And that's how he seduced you into his bed?
OK. You know what? I may as well tell you. I'm not going to university.
You know what? I may as well tell you. I'm not going to university. I'm moving to Milan with Stefano.
- You're going nowhere, Angela. - You don't understand.
He's writing a novel that might turnout to be an incredible success.
- He's lying to you. - No, he's not! Google him.
Stefano Tommasi. He's an actual novelist.
He's had a book published that actual civilians have bought and read!
You do what you have to do, Angela.
But there's something I have to do.
I have to tell the police
that your professor was at Pilati's house with Maria Spezi the night of the assault.
I have proof. I'm sorry.
I hate you!
You don't know anything about love!
You don't know anything about love!
Let's see. Maria.
You said the only people at the house with you that night were Mr. Pilati
and some boy whose name you couldn't remember.
Yes.
Any luck remembering the boy's name?
No.
And no one else was there?
No.
So you didn't arrive there with Pilati
and your teacher, Stefano Tommasi?
No...
Tommasi
left before anything happened.
That's convenient.
Is there anyone you're not covering for in this story?
I don't feel so good. I need to leave.
Got anything more you want to tell us?
I didn't hurt my daughter.
Neither did anyone else, it seems.
Well, I have a question...
Walter.
Do you think you deserve a daughter like that?
No. I do not.
I left before anything happened.
I went home. I swear.
- Home. - Yes.
Anyone who can verify that?
Mr. Pilati, we're ready. Whenever you want.
- Oh, here she is! - You lied to me.
- Oh, here she is! - You lied to me. You told me you were in Milan when it happened.
No, I didn't.
I said I wasn't there when it happened. I'd left them all in the kitchen.
Claudia, you of all people should understand how this might look...
not just for me, for us, for the campaign.
You know how many people would like to read... - Can we get a photo, please? - Yeah, sure.
- Can we get a photo, please? - Yeah, sure.
"Pilati employee arrested for sexual assault".
My lawyers are seriously worried.
You have to help me here, Claudia. Look, if it happened in my house, which I still pray it didn't,
Look, if it happened in my house, which I still pray it didn't,
I did the right thing.
I fired the boy, Dario, my caretaker. He's wild.
- Dario? - Yes, his name's Dario Nobile.
- He begged me to take him back, but... - Fuck!
- He begged me to take him back, but... - Fuck! Mr. Pilati, the ribbon...?
What a great idea.
- Well done, Claudia. - Thank you.
- Our mayor... - Excuse me...
You're avoiding me!
You're not even pretending to sleep on the sofa.
What the fuck are you doing, incriminating Pilati?
He's bringing in lawyers from Milan. But I get it now.
You're trying to protect that lunatic Dario.
Your fucking future stepson! I'm just gathering all the facts,
I'm just gathering all the facts, Trying to sort the truth from the...
Trying to sort the truth from the... - May we? - Yes, of course.
- Thank you. - You're welcome.
Don't make that face!
- What face? - The judging-my-ambition face.
This is my chance, Roberto.
My only chance.
This is my life and I won't let you get in the way,
not you, not our marriage, is that clear?
Yes, I'm ambitious.
But you know what? To some people, that's a very attractive trait.
Claudia, wait!
You want to explain yourself?
Matteo. Would you mind doing that thing you do...?
Go.
I wasn't always like this.
You mean secretive?
No. I mean the way I am.
When that woman touched me, in the kitchen, and you jumped to my defense...
without a second thought. It's so like you.
Fierce. Heart first.
It made me feel... less alone.
Like you understood me, without wanting anything from me.
Can you imagine what that felt like?
This...
'thing' I have, this condition,
it's devastating, you know.
And it came out of nowhere. I've tried and tried,
but no-one seems to be able to trace it back to anything, to find a cause.
It's made relationships...
impossible. I'd freeze,
I'd shake and, yes, sometimes I'd... crumble.
And women always felt rejected, no matter what I said. Of course they did.
no matter what I said. Of course they did.
So I chose loneliness,
it was so much easier. Anyway, I've always been a private person.
I'm a very wealthy man and I can afford anything I want.
Except the thing I want most...
intimacy.
The kind of love you deserve.
I want to deal with this, get the best help I can.
I want to be with you.
Really be with you. Now.
In this universe.
You're an extraordinary man, Curzio.
I'll help you.
I'm sorry.
- The reception... - Yes.
RAPIST
Mr. Tommasi will not be attending class today.
Mr. Tommasi will not be attending class today. You are all dismissed.
This is insane, guys. I mean, Mr. Tommasi and Maria?
Why aren't you at school, Angela?
Why aren't you at school, Angela? What was Pilati doing here just now? What has he got on you?
What was Pilati doing here just now? What has he got on you?
- Listen... - Look at yourself!
It's like he reduced you to some pathetic, lame version of yourself.
Sit down, Angela. I have to tell you something.
I haven't been writing my novel.
- What? - I'm ghost-writing a book for Pilati.
- Why didn't you just tell me? - Well,
it's not exactly how I envisioned my career as a writer.
But you know what?
He's had a really interesting life.
Made his millions on debt management.
He doesn't have any family, he wants this to be his legacy.
Honestly, there's something there. He's a bit of a rebel.
Genius? Rebel? The guy's an asshole!
Well, that asshole's paying me.
That's serious money. The stuff I need to support my ex-wife?
I'm going to ask you one last time.
And if you lie to me again, I'm going to call the principal
and tell him we have fucked approximately 200 times since June!
What were you doing Sunday night?
I've already told the police.
OK.
You know what you and I are going to do now? We're leaving.
We'll go someplace. We'll go and live...
someplace we like.
I'll work my ass off and I'll support you. You write, nothing else.
You're talented. You wrote a bestseller!
Ten years ago!
Ten fucking years ago!
It could be like we're starting out.
Starting out?! I'm 40!
Look, Angela, you're wonderful.
You're fantastic.
But maybe it's not such a great idea to be thinking long-term with me.
This is insane. It can't go on. We knew from the start that it wouldn't last.
One of us has to be the adult here.
And a quick check of our driver's licenses shows that would be me.
One day you'll understand.
One day you'll understand.
- Something's happened. - I'll go for a smoke.
- Dad... - Love... what is it?
Don't tell Mom. Please don't tell Mom. Don't tell the school.
He broke up with me.
It hurts so much.
Tell me everything.
Sit down. What happened to you?
Tell me.
He said we shouldn't think long-term.
We shouldn't think long-term.
He said one of us has to be the adult.
One of us has to be the adult.
He told me to leave.
Leave. Leave.
Dad?
Are you OK? - Are you OK? - Yes.
I need a glass of water.
Ah, enter Zeus!
Ah, enter Zeus! Here to defend his beloved daughter, Athena!
Sunday night, did the boy leave before or after you?
Well done! Well done!
I could ruin you.
I know you slept with my daughter, your student.
I know you're the reason Maria, another student of yours,
got into that car. I have incriminating evidence.
You were an accomplice to whatever happened. And you have a motive for lying about all of it.
And you have a motive for lying about all of it.
Did you leave before or after the boy?
Well,
I mean, the whole 'damsel in distress' thing
has a certain cachet in erotica,
but frankly I've always found it rather depressing.
I wanted to take the girl home
to her father, but she insisted on staying...
so...
I left.
Before the boy.
Anyway, I already had a willing damsel waiting between my sheets.
You smug piece of shit! You piece of shit!
You piece of shit!
You're ridiculous!
You really can't handle it, eh?
Roberto, come here.
Look!
"My father had been changed in a fundamental way.
Things that had once been unthinkable in him
suddenly became a reality.
He was...
- like a ticking bomb..." - Poor girl...
What is this?
Footage they filmed in secret of Maria Spezi during a lesson.
They've just put it up and it's already got over 800 views.
How on earth did no-one see the warning signs?
"If you show your fear, you bait the beast.
And so I hid it. And so I hide it to this day..."
- What happened to you? - Nothing.
You still think he's innocent?
"He would pass out night after night.
I would fall asleep in the chair next to his makeshift bed...
I would wake up to find him staring at me with eyes
I would wake up to find him staring at me with eyes that seemed to be hollowed out...
His undying anger at the town
over a wrongful arrest that happened years ago
had become a rage at the very universe.
A universe
that was no more likely to give him justice than his own community.
A community he now saw as heartless and corrupt...
After my mother died, a strange inversion had taken place.
I had become the parent and he was the child...
I thought it was just a temporary arrangement, a function of his drinking
Turn it off!
Turn it off! Ginevra recorded it!
Turn it off! Ginevra recorded it! "But as the weeks went past,
"But as the weeks went past,
I started to understand that the situation would never change,
I would never be free.
I would never be free".
And... 3,700 VIEWS
The end.
What happened to you?
Six of our prime accounts cancelled their contracts this morning.
I've been on the phone for hours.
They're saying you're 'unstable',
'violent'.
Maria...
Wait, please.
Emma?
What clients went back on the contract?
Emma! The clients who went back on the contract.
It's all clear!
They're all friends of Pilati.
Can you bring up their perimeter history?
I just trashed it all.
There was a court order.
How many times do I have to tell you? Nothing's ever trashed.
- Client one! - That's Dario's car! Client two! Client three!
Client two! Client three! What are they hiding?
Dario, what else did you do that night?
Client five.
Are you getting this? Look!
No... Maria was already injured.
Dario, you're a liar...
It wasn't Spezi.
They arrested him at 2.56!
Unstable and violent.
Maria.
Please come to class today.
Stefano's back.
I'll walk in with you.
Let's start by taking this to Mr. and Mrs. Grassi.
Sorry? Can you give us a moment, please? Thank you.
- What happened to you? - Never mind!
Dario lied to you. He lied to both of us.
It can only get worse for him.
He has to start telling the truth. He has to go to the police.
If you want, I'll go with him.
I used to be your master electrician.
Now I'm lucky if someone trusts me with their toaster.
Look at us, a couple of outcasts.
Or as my wife would put it, 'undesirables'...
A couple of rejects.
Why did you say it was your fault when they found you with Maria?
Because it was.
We'd had a fight in the afternoon. Over my drinking.
She ran away and I was too drunk...
to stop her. That's the thing.
I could have stopped her. Everything that's happened to her is my fault.
I could have stopped her. Everything that's happened to her is my fault. I'm a useless fucker.
I just wish she'd written about the good times in her story.
- There were good times, you know. - I know there were.
Roberto...
After that incident
with Angela,
you had to fire me, I can see that now. But you know I would never...
I owe you an apology, Walt.
We all do.
"All I wanted was a ride on a carousel.
A carefree, pointless trip to the heavens.
But when I got there, the carousel was broken.
My mother never left a door unlocked
or a seatbelt unfastened.
If a dog appeared on our street, she called the dog pound.
So... to lose a daughter...
It shook the core of her world."
How did you meet?
At Gilda's Beach.
He loved that the girls were hot for me.
He said
I made him feel younger.
And then one day he said that if I wanted, I could...
I could use his house to get laid...
And I said yes right away.
I didn't even think about it!
His only deal was I had to do it in the den,
not in his bedroom.
I thought it was a germ thing.
But then...
I found out the real reason.
Look, I'm not proud of it.
I fucked up.
But I thought that for me it was only about going to bed with these girls.
And anyway they were all consenting. You can check that if you like.
- Did Pilati pay you for this? - Oh, yeah.
Cash.
And the bonuses got bigger and bigger.
Tell me about Maria.
"I could hear them all shouting my name.
But I just wanted someone, anyone to make the carousel go round and round..."
Where's the mechanic?
"And there he was...
the man who fixes everything."
Sir, can you repair the carousel?
"I knew he'd magic it back into motion for me.
How could he know how tragic his timing would prove to be...?
Such an innocuous moment.
Such a ruinous result."
I mean, Maria was different.
Everything went wrong.
You could tell she was really young,
but...
Pilati doesn't care. I keep topping up her glass.
Like I did with all the other girls.
Hi... Drink, drink, drink...
The other guy, the one she knows,
he's getting nervous. He splits.
No, don't go, don't go...
- I need to go. - Please... please.
Pilati, man, he can't stop staring at her.
It's like he was feeling her with his eyes.
And I mean... you could tell he had a... he was getting hard.
you could tell he had a... he was getting hard.
"...I was never scared.
In fact, I was kind of fascinated...
...it was more like watching a horse
taking a piss in the street."
I kissed her once
but it was ridiculous. I couldn't do it.
She was too drunk. It just wasn't right, you know?
We tried to sober her up, gave her coffee.
- Who made the coffee? - Pilati.
But...
it didn't help. Next thing I know, she's passed out.
Now...
he's right there with me,
unbuttoning her blouse,
unbuttoning her blouse, but like really slow and careful so he doesn't actually touch her skin.
but like really slow and careful so he doesn't actually touch her skin.
And he's sweating. And he looks at me, like...
'take over', your turn now. And I'm, like, no way.
I couldn't, I didn't want to.
So he yells at me to get out.
I was very drunk.
I don't remember anything, I remember that I...
I broke this camera, Roberto's...
And then I heard Maria screaming.
What the fuck are you doing?
"All the ingredients were there. A man holding his penis.
A curious little girl.
A mother consumed with blind panic.
I was crying,
but only because I cut my lip in the fall.
Try telling that to my mother.
Try telling her it was urine, not semen on Spezi's pants."
He was like an animal.
Beating her up.
Kicking her in the head, really hard.
Then he wants her back on the chair,
so he grabs her by the wrist and yanks.
I'm amazed her fucking arm didn't come off.
And he's screaming at me like it's my fault.
He said to me...
"I had to try".
I had to try!
I had to try! I thought I wouldn't feel it!
- And I'm like, feel what? - The death,
- And I'm like, feel what? - The death, I thought I wouldn't feel the death in her flesh!
I thought I wouldn't feel the death in her flesh!
Get her out of here.
"No other angle of the truth was ever allowed in our house.
It had to be my mother's,
the one born of fear,
the one that absolved her from losing me in the first place,
the one thing she loved most in the world.
I've never understood this story
because I've never understood my mother.
But now I do.
Would this have been a better story if I had been traumatized?
More interesting?
Probably.
But that's not the story I'm telling."
Just for your information,
the long key's for his main door. He's all yours!
She was...
she was... so frightened by me.
She... jumped out of the car.
And I was... looking for her when Roberto stopped me, because...
I wanted to do something. I wanted to help her.
Fuck!
The guy's gonna kill me!
Don't worry.
Other than alcohol, what showed up in toxicology?
I told you. Just the painkiller, Oxycodone.
- How many times have you slept with her? - Once.
Roberto, please.
At least tell the truth.
- It is the truth. - Sure!
But it's not the reason.
You know as well as I do...
this marriage is done.
And Angela's already got one foot out of the door.
Explain something to me, Roberto.
Do you really want to take an axe to everything we've built together?
The business? The family? Your career?
And all to be
with some lonely woman and her screwed-up kids.
Just because you want to play at being 19 again.
Are you sure that it's really love
and not another kind of sleepwalking?
I honestly...
don't know.
But it's worth the risk.
There's something I have to ask you...
were you aware that Ferrario's people erased more than just
were you aware that Ferrario's people erased more than just the fundraiser footage?
I thought so.
The guy is sick
and evil, Claudia.
- Who can buy his way out of anything. - Maybe.
But I can't help wondering...
But I can't help wondering... why would a girl pass out right after she was given coffee to sober her up?
why would a girl pass out right after she was given coffee to sober her up?
Strange, no?
Claudia, she could have died.
That guy...
That guy made me feel alive again!
Whatever Pilati did, whoever he is...
he gave me a taste of something...
I'd forgotten.
But that's my problem, not yours.
And I'll tell you something else, Roberto,
it's the last time I let myself be defined by a man.
Any man.
Who are you?
I'm Maria's father, Walter Spezi.
What do you want?
I want to know what happened Sunday night.
Mr. Spezi, I really feel for you, but sadly...
everything's come to light, the parties, the drugs...
I'm raging at that pig Dario,
He's been abusing his privilege as my caretaker for some time.
Maria's not the first girl he's brought up here to seduce,
I can tell you that. Your issue is with the boy. Talk to him.
Your issue is with the boy. Talk to him.
Your issue is with the boy. Talk to him. Dario Nobile, Via Donati, I think?
Dario Nobile, Via Donati, I think?
- But Roberto... - Let me tell you about Santini,
he's fucking Dario's mother. The whole town knows.
Of course he's going to protect the boy.
I'm sorry. I really am. You deserve better. Apologies, I have to go.
- What do you say we go watch a show? - Alright.
Bye.
I talked to Claudia. I told her everything.
What did she say?
Mom, there's a scary man.
- I'll kill you. - Call the police!
- Walter! - You're a liar!
- Walter, what the fuck are you doing? - Leave me alone.
He's trying to kill my son!
- Leave me alone! - Look at me!
It's me, Walter. Look at me!
- Leave me alone! - It wasn't Dario. It was Pilati.
I swear to you, I will find the evidence.
Believe me.
Walt. It's over.
It's over.
Yes...
it's over.
I'm all done.
It's me they want. It's always been me.
Come outside! Come out with your hands up!
Come here, Spezi, come here.
Keep coming.
Keep coming. Come... Hold it!
Cuff him, Ricciardi.
Stop. Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon, Walter!
Drop your weapon!
Oxycodone.
- Wine! - OK, calm down, guys!
- Wine! - OK, calm down, guys! Calm down. OK?
No, I want wine!
- Enough, enough. - More, more... a little more, yes.
